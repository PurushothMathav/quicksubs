00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:09.790
Being angry depends on the time, but it turns out that it is the time when you are angry.

2
00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:20.080
Why is that what he's been doing, all this time,

3
00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:22.320
Not doing anything.

4
00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.500
He just learns what he wants and takes as much time as he needs.

5
00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.470
If you are fine, he can cultivate like me, so don’t think about what I can do in my place.

6
00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:47.120
Listen to what, behind Ping Si Qian is my past,

7
00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.880
And behind you is Daqiang, the vegetable seller.

8
00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:01.100
Brother Xue, I remember saying nothing.

9
00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:05.340
I beg you to love me on duty,

10
00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:08.820
Feel me one, let me. we

11
00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:23.490
Forgiveness has returned

12
00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.270
I advise you to take full account of your position

13
00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:29.050
I hope you really come back otherwise

14
00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:30.930
Thought process like yours

15
00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.300
This is death

16
00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.650
I can't forget to ask you for help

17
00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:38.200
But I'm pregnant

18
00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:40.820
Could that be your child?

19
00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:42.080
You won’t come back today

20
00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:43.600
Do you regret your decision?

21
00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:44.220
No why

22
00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.900
I will start from the beginning

23
00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:48.480
I never thought about having children with you

24
00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:53.280
Actually I'm pregnant

25
00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:55.100
really your child

26
00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:56.640
You never

27
00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.000
from the new year

28
00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:01.740
Is it worth deceiving Dolan who bought him?

29
00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:08.479
So for so long you treated me

30
00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:13.300
You can't even make money at a low price, right?

31
00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:15.760
engaged hands

32
00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:17.010
my heart

33
00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:19.330
There is only one person every day

34
00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:24.130
It has to be, but it's all my fault, but it's all my fault

35
00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:26.590
But it’s all nothing
