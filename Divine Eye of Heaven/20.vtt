00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:04.233
Mom mom your mom mom

2
00:00:05.866 --> 00:00:07.933
My mother is allergic, please give him medicine for allergies.

3
00:00:07.933 --> 00:00:09.100
Anti-allergic medicine

4
00:00:09.266 --> 00:00:10.133
Allergy medicine bar

5
00:00:10.133 --> 00:00:12.200
Medicine is allergy difficult medicine

6
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.600
Am I sick at home today?

7
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:16.766
How can you talk like that?

8
00:00:16.766 --> 00:00:17.866
My mother followed the doctor's advice

9
00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:19.066
And did nothing

10
00:00:19.066 --> 00:00:20.266
What happened in your hospital

11
00:00:20.266 --> 00:00:21.166
Why do you say that?

12
00:00:21.166 --> 00:00:22.133
Your mother had allergies before

13
00:00:22.133 --> 00:00:23.266
Why don't you notify me every day?

14
00:00:23.266 --> 00:00:24.700
This will kill you, you know?

15
00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:25.500
allergy

16
00:00:25.566 --> 00:00:27.500
We don't eat anything allergic, do we?

17
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:28.566
Just a sip of chicken soup

18
00:00:28.566 --> 00:00:30.266
My mom used to drink chicken soup all the time

19
00:00:30.266 --> 00:00:32.500
I'm a doctor. I don't know if I'm allergic.

20
00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:33.766
That's because you are not good at medicine.

21
00:00:33.766 --> 00:00:36.500
My mother suffered from cerebral congestion and compressed nerves, resulting in lesions

22
00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.300
It also made her allergic to wolfberry

23
00:00:39.466 --> 00:00:41.900
I don't know about wolfberry allergy.

24
00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.033
Mom, I didn't mean to

25
00:00:44.066 --> 00:00:45.133
It's okay, Snowy.

26
00:00:45.133 --> 00:00:47.700
In the future, just don't give Mom anything with wolfberry.

27
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.933
Yeah. How do you know that?

28
00:00:49.933 --> 00:00:52.066
I can tell at a glance

29
00:00:52.066 --> 00:00:53.400
Hmph take a look

30
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:54.866
What did you do with your eyes?

31
00:00:54.866 --> 00:00:56.433
What about joint venture resonance?

32
00:00:56.733 --> 00:00:57.933
You stinky migrant workers

33
00:00:57.933 --> 00:00:59.533
I just watch too many online jokes.

34
00:00:59.533 --> 00:01:02.166
In order to pretend to disregard the life of his own mother

35
00:01:02.166 --> 00:01:03.433
Do you want to like him?

36
00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:04.266
You go to fashion

37
00:01:04.266 --> 00:01:05.300
Go to the press conference

38
00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.566
That can pretend to be you

39
00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:08.866
So what's up?

40
00:01:08.866 --> 00:01:10.600
Noisy college president
