1
00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:01.566
The bead glowed.

2
00:00:01.566 --> 00:00:03.566
Is it the legendary night pearl?

3
00:00:03.933 --> 00:00:05.633
Okay, let's turn on the lights

4
00:00:05.866 --> 00:00:07.566
It really is the night pearl

5
00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:10.300
It is said that when Lafayette died

6
00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:11.500
One in my mouth

7
00:00:11.933 --> 00:00:13.166
This moment today

8
00:00:13.166 --> 00:00:16.033
I can't even shout it out of my mouth. It's a new hour hand

9
00:00:16.533 --> 00:00:18.266
At the auction

10
00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:20.233
There's only about a billion left.

11
00:00:20.566 --> 00:00:22.200
1 billion to the Virgin

12
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.333
Send 1 billion high life group really rich

13
00:00:25.333 --> 00:00:27.366
It's bigger than the Galeries Lafayette one.

14
00:00:27.566 --> 00:00:29.000
That's pretty cool.

15
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.266
Now although there are artificially cultivated malachite

16
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.700
But your big malachite

17
00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.466
Cultured or not

18
00:00:36.466 --> 00:00:37.966
It's priceless

19
00:00:37.966 --> 00:00:39.466
I'm so excited.

20
00:00:39.466 --> 00:00:41.500
You see this is not an antique

21
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.600
Today is Grandpa Hou's birthday banquet

22
00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.200
I didn't say I had to send antiques

23
00:00:45.566 --> 00:00:47.433
And the comparison just now

24
00:00:48.066 --> 00:00:49.900
I didn't say I have to understand

25
00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:51.233
Mr. Song is right

26
00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:52.300
old man

27
00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:54.966
I haven't said that you have to be Mr. Hu to accept it.

28
00:00:54.966 --> 00:00:56.900
It's your turn.

29
00:00:57.533 --> 00:01:01.900
Liang Shao, bring my acceptance up
