1
00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.600
What's there to see?

2
00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.200
Hmph, it really is a kitchen knife

3
00:00:07.366 --> 00:00:08.700
The answer is all up to you

4
00:00:37.933 --> 00:00:41.033
I'm going to read your answers.

5
00:00:41.133 --> 00:00:43.200
Then cut the rough stone on site

6
00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.366
I don't need to say it then.

7
00:00:45.366 --> 00:00:47.466
And you all know what the outcome will be.

8
00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:50.966
Master Xie believes that

9
00:00:51.066 --> 00:00:54.066
This is a piece of low-quality glutinous jadeite.

10
00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.733
The former master believes that

11
00:00:56.733 --> 00:00:58.800
Glass jadeite can be opened inside

12
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:02.433
It seems that the answer gap between the two is quite large

13
00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.666
As for this Master Yang

14
00:01:06.133 --> 00:01:09.633
He believes that in this rough stone

15
00:01:10.466 --> 00:01:11.433
No emerald

16
00:01:11.733 --> 00:01:14.400
Yes, hahahaha.

17
00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.233
Over 80 million rough stones

18
00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:17.700
You said you can't open the jade.

19
00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.666
I'm dying of laughter, haha, okay.

20
00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.866
Then let's get started 7 rough stones

21
00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:34.766
There is no green in this knife.

22
00:01:34.766 --> 00:01:38.200
I don't believe it, let me do it.
