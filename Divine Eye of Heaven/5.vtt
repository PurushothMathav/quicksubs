00:00:06.666 --> 00:00:08.833
Mom, just come out

2
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.233
Just come out

3
00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:12.300
Is that so?

4
00:00:13.333 --> 00:00:15.066
Mom is at ease

5
00:00:15.566 --> 00:00:18.600
It's all my fault, I'm blind

6
00:00:18.966 --> 00:00:21.400
Must marry that snake fairy and man

7
00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.066
I'm so angry with you

8
00:00:25.066 --> 00:00:26.033
It's all my fault

9
00:00:27.166 --> 00:00:28.866
It's all my fault

10
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.200
A little more than a jerk

11
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.000
It's okay, the woman is fine

12
00:00:34.566 --> 00:00:35.866
Mom, don't worry.

13
00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.200
I'll get the dowry money back tomorrow

14
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:40.433
See you

15
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:41.900
Never mind.

16
00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.700
Just come out safe and sound

17
00:00:45.733 --> 00:00:47.766
Those unreconciled things

18
00:00:48.566 --> 00:00:51.300
Forget it, right?

19
00:00:53.566 --> 00:00:54.800
Yes shit

20
00:00:55.933 --> 00:00:57.166
It's my mom's fault

21
00:00:57.566 --> 00:01:01.233
Mom is going down to see your dad

22
00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:03.500
You first

23
00:01:04.266 --> 00:01:06.300
You have a good rest first

24
00:01:09.666 --> 00:01:10.566
Light Snow

25
00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.566
Take me to the doctor

26
00:01:12.933 --> 00:01:14.766
I want to know about my mother's condition

27
00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.100
Mom, did you save me?

28
00:01:24.733 --> 00:01:26.966
Gave all the dowry money to their family

29
00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.466
Brother is not just the bride price money

30
00:01:33.866 --> 00:01:35.100
And a cemetery

31
00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:37.633
Mom gave them the cemetery

32
00:01:37.966 --> 00:01:41.266
They are willing to make a butterfly tree or something
