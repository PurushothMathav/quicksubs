00:00:00.866 --> 00:00:04.133
Does Mr. Sheng have anything to teach you?

2
00:00:04.133 --> 00:00:06.966
If it's dirty water, it's free

3
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.766
Although Sun Shenyi did not save his throat

4
00:00:09.933 --> 00:00:11.566
But he did his best.

5
00:00:11.666 --> 00:00:13.233
I'm kind too

6
00:00:13.266 --> 00:00:14.700
Everyone here saw it

7
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.000
Of course I know

8
00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:17.566
I'm not like some people

9
00:00:17.566 --> 00:00:19.766
It was obviously the throat made by Master Yang

10
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.633
But it was Sun Shen

11
00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:24.033
That's so thick-skinned

12
00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.000
However, before some people leave

13
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.633
Should we place a bet?

14
00:00:27.866 --> 00:00:29.500
Did you fulfill it first?

15
00:00:29.566 --> 00:00:30.500
What bet?

16
00:00:30.766 --> 00:00:31.666
No, no.

17
00:00:32.666 --> 00:00:33.466
OK

18
00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.933
Liang Shao was so proud when he bet just now

19
00:00:36.933 --> 00:00:39.200
Why is it a shrinking turtle now?

20
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:40.200
No words

21
00:00:40.333 --> 00:00:43.600
What gambler I don't know don't know

22
00:00:44.366 --> 00:00:46.233
Everyone here has seen it

23
00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.266
There are Lao Hou and Miss Hou to testify

24
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.366
I can't say anything if you don't admit it.

25
00:00:50.366 --> 00:00:54.266
But your Liang family's reputation is about to be discredited

26
00:00:54.266 --> 00:00:55.466
Hahaha

27
00:00:56.166 --> 00:00:57.433
It's true.

28
00:01:01.666 --> 00:01:02.666
I'm willing to admit defeat

29
00:01:02.666 --> 00:01:04.700
Haoliang Shao

30
00:01:04.866 --> 00:01:06.100
Then you write down the words

31
00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:06.933
What are you doing?

32
00:01:06.933 --> 00:01:10.900
Tomorrow, I will arrange for someone to go to your auction house to hand it over.

33
00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:14.500
Our Liang family made a promise

34
00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.400
I'm here today to put the words here too

35
00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.600
Now that my son is studying

36
00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.133
You can send someone tomorrow, Mr. Sheng

37
00:01:22.133 --> 00:01:24.066
Isn't it just an auction house?

38
00:01:24.166 --> 00:01:28.033
Our Liang family can afford to lose, wait a minute
