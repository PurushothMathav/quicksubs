00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:01.100
What's wrong?

2
00:00:01.266 --> 00:00:02.400
I want jujube kernels

3
00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:04.433
And what you gave me is Mrs. Li

4
00:00:04.666 --> 00:00:05.366
What acid?

5
00:00:05.366 --> 00:00:05.900
Master Li's

6
00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:07.500
I caught it according to the prescription you gave me.

7
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.066
I want you to mess around here again

8
00:00:09.066 --> 00:00:09.966
I want you to look good

9
00:00:09.966 --> 00:00:11.100
Get your stuff and get out

10
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:13.700
Give me my jujube kernels and I'll go

11
00:00:14.333 --> 00:00:15.600
Do you understand?

12
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.366
This is the medicine you wanted

13
00:00:17.366 --> 00:00:18.700
Don't be here looking for trouble

14
00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:19.733
Get out of here

15
00:00:19.733 --> 00:00:21.566
Is this jujube seed or plum jujube?

16
00:00:21.566 --> 00:00:23.966
I called the Chinese medicine doctor in your store to take a look.

17
00:00:23.966 --> 00:00:25.533
Ok I'll call you

18
00:00:25.533 --> 00:00:28.233
If it weren't for what you said, you wouldn't look good

19
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:36.866
Is this the Three Highs?

20
00:00:36.866 --> 00:00:39.866
I suggest you let me see the prescription I gave you

21
00:00:39.866 --> 00:00:40.900
And your tickets.

22
00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:43.100
It's clearly written on it

23
00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.066
If this is sour

24
00:00:45.066 --> 00:00:47.566
I can only ask someone from the market supervision department.

25
00:00:47.566 --> 00:00:48.566
In person.

26
00:00:48.733 --> 00:00:51.666
These two drugs have the same effect

27
00:00:51.666 --> 00:00:53.500
Why are you torn?

28
00:00:53.966 --> 00:00:55.700
What does brother mean?

29
00:00:55.733 --> 00:00:57.166
What jujube kernels?

30
00:00:57.166 --> 00:00:58.500
What is pear jujube kernel?

31
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.133
Although these two knives have the same medicinal properties

32
00:01:01.133 --> 00:01:02.100
drug-effect connection

33
00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.600
But this price

34
00:01:04.333 --> 00:01:06.333
It's dozens of times worse.

35
00:01:06.333 --> 00:01:08.400
You are talking nonsense.

36
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.666
Oh, I see.

37
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.466
You're not here to buy medicine

38
00:01:13.466 --> 00:01:15.466
Are you here to make trouble?

39
00:01:15.466 --> 00:01:18.066
Humph boss boss
