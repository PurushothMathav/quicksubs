1
00:00:01.133 --> 00:00:02.966
I don't believe it let me come

2
00:00:08.466 --> 00:00:10.233
This is impossible.

3
00:00:10.866 --> 00:00:12.100
80 million rough stones

4
00:00:12.533 --> 00:00:14.200
How could there be no jadeite?

5
00:00:15.166 --> 00:00:17.800
Although the price of 80 million does have a level

6
00:00:18.166 --> 00:00:20.200
And he was right.

7
00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:21.000
This question

8
00:00:21.666 --> 00:00:23.233
Master Yang won

9
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.233
Now let's move on to the second question

10
00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:33.500
Here we go.

11
00:00:33.566 --> 00:00:35.666
Here are two handed down jade bottles

12
00:00:35.666 --> 00:00:37.066
true or false

13
00:00:37.166 --> 00:00:40.633
Next, please distinguish which bottle is genuine

14
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.066
Which bottle is fake?

15
00:01:05.133 --> 00:01:06.800
The former master believes that

16
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.266
It's true that there is a bump in the bottle mouth on the left.

17
00:01:09.266 --> 00:01:11.033
Right? That's right.

18
00:01:11.133 --> 00:01:13.366
This legendary jade vase?

19
00:01:13.366 --> 00:01:14.833
It's just missing a corner.

20
00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:16.200
What about these two?

21
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.833
Only one is missing a corner.

22
00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:19.433
It must be that one.

23
00:01:20.866 --> 00:01:23.133
Master Xie believes that in these two bottles

24
00:01:23.133 --> 00:01:24.266
None of them are real.

25
00:01:24.266 --> 00:01:25.966
Right? That's right.

26
00:01:26.066 --> 00:01:28.100
These are all jade bottles that have long been lost

27
00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:29.333
I don't believe there is a genuine product.

28
00:01:29.333 --> 00:01:30.966
Reality Coco

29
00:01:31.133 --> 00:01:32.800
Even if it were true

30
00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.466
It was copied.

31
00:01:34.566 --> 00:01:36.500
It's not the same pair anymore

32
00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.366
Master Yang believes that

33
00:01:39.133 --> 00:01:42.300
The bottle on my right is completely genuine.

34
00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:43.366
Right?
