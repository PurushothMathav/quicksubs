00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:01.933
No, I must have answered correctly just now.

2
00:00:01.933 --> 00:00:04.166
This must be an antique padded jacket

3
00:00:04.366 --> 00:00:05.466
What's your trouble?

4
00:00:06.466 --> 00:00:08.233
Nothing, by the way, mom

5
00:00:08.366 --> 00:00:10.166
I've never seen this before.

6
00:00:10.166 --> 00:00:11.366
Kind of curious.

7
00:00:11.366 --> 00:00:13.500
This is a sewing box in our house.

8
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.566
I thought about it, and I was also hospitalized left and right.

9
00:00:15.566 --> 00:00:17.133
Let your sister bring it over

10
00:00:17.133 --> 00:00:19.866
Maybe you can still sew clothes, mom

11
00:00:19.966 --> 00:00:22.666
Don't be too tired. It's alright?

12
00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:25.300
Mom, I just got off work, you're done.

13
00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:31.366
Is it Miss Hong?

14
00:00:31.466 --> 00:00:34.900
Your daughter is so beautiful.

15
00:00:35.766 --> 00:00:39.266
Brother, Xiaoming, what's wrong with you?

16
00:00:39.266 --> 00:00:40.066
OK

17
00:00:40.466 --> 00:00:41.500
Nothing bothers you.

18
00:00:42.766 --> 00:00:44.866
Well, cardiovascular problems

19
00:00:44.866 --> 00:00:45.966
It's serious.

20
00:00:45.966 --> 00:00:48.133
It's no small matter if this delays treatment

21
00:00:48.133 --> 00:00:49.800
But everyone is in the hospital

22
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.366
I shouldn't have to worry about it.

23
00:00:52.166 --> 00:00:54.166
Mom was indeed bullied by the people

24
00:00:54.766 --> 00:00:56.933
It doesn't bleed, but it doesn't necessarily require surgery.

25
00:00:56.933 --> 00:00:59.100
I can eat it before I finish it

26
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.533
Auntie, how did you sleep this afternoon?

27
00:01:01.533 --> 00:01:02.700
It's clean here

28
00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:04.333
Slept well, don't you know?

29
00:01:04.333 --> 00:01:06.466
Did you disturb Mr. Hou?

30
00:01:06.533 --> 00:01:07.600
Not really. No, actually.

31
00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.000
Exactly, I'm bored by myself

32
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.500
Is there a big girl to chat with?

33
00:01:10.733 --> 00:01:13.200
This leather gall is gone hahaha

34
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.666
You two are chatting about eggplant

35
00:01:16.766 --> 00:01:18.500
Dad, how are you doing?

36
00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.966
Is it okay? What can I do?

37
00:01:20.966 --> 00:01:22.500
Isn't it just the body to check?

38
00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.100
Can't see the fuss

39
00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.900
Mom

40
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.966
Well, here's the hen soup I made all night.

41
00:01:27.966 --> 00:01:28.900
nourish the body

42
00:01:30.566 --> 00:01:31.466
You can't drink it.
