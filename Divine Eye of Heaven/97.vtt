00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:02.100
If I win

2
00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.333
If you win, I'll jump off this building

3
00:00:05.333 --> 00:00:07.066
It's too cheap to let you die

4
00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:09.000
If I'm not mistaken

5
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.700
Give the sacred Buddha to the mother of the Holy Ancestor

6
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.300
You did it too

7
00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:17.433
Yes, you can see the problem with that bracelet.

8
00:00:17.466 --> 00:00:21.100
So I win and I don't want you to die

9
00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:23.100
I want you to live well

10
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.200
I believe in Mr. Sheng

11
00:00:25.466 --> 00:00:28.033
It will definitely keep you alive

12
00:00:29.333 --> 00:00:31.633
Sure, do it!

13
00:00:31.733 --> 00:00:35.133
Miss Guan, please ask question 3, Master Yang

14
00:00:35.133 --> 00:00:36.433
You are too impulsive

15
00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.466
No one has ever answered this third question

16
00:00:40.266 --> 00:00:41.600
Then you're lucky

17
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.300
I can answer it for you today.

18
00:00:47.366 --> 00:00:48.366
Mr. Yang

19
00:00:48.766 --> 00:00:51.766
Can you tell where this slate came from?

20
00:00:51.766 --> 00:00:53.166
And the words above

21
00:00:53.333 --> 00:00:56.466
Can you see what the expression means?

22
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.466
Why can't you see it?

23
00:01:08.466 --> 00:01:11.166
I don't want to die. I want to stall for time.

24
00:01:11.966 --> 00:01:14.966
Why are you in such a hurry to enjoy it?

25
00:01:14.966 --> 00:01:17.566
The life that Mr. Sheng brings you is better than death

26
00:01:17.566 --> 00:01:21.500
Then you said this slate is not from the Central Plains

27
00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.366
It's the Kunlun Mountains.

28
00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:25.166
How do you know?

29
00:01:26.533 --> 00:01:28.066
The text above tells me

30
00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.666
Also recorded your family's secrets

31
00:01:31.133 --> 00:01:32.633
How do we solve this game?

32
00:01:32.766 --> 00:01:33.866
It says here

33
00:01:33.866 --> 00:01:37.000
Need to find someone with a prodigy

34
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.166
Combined Tianmu Prodigy

35
00:01:39.566 --> 00:01:41.400
Isn't that my ability?

36
00:01:41.733 --> 00:01:44.066
The bond is lost again

37
00:01:44.366 --> 00:01:46.100
And? And?
