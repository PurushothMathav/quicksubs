1
00:00:00.533 --> 00:00:04.400
Miss Hou, Dean Xu is right

2
00:00:04.533 --> 00:00:07.000
Why don't we keep him here?

3
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.833
Wait a minute I have a situation

4
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:11.500
Teacher Xie Yang

5
00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:14.200
Guys, my father has medication today

6
00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:15.966
The birthday banquet can't go on

7
00:00:15.966 --> 00:00:17.233
Please eat

8
00:00:17.266 --> 00:00:20.033
If you are in a hurry, please leave by yourself

9
00:00:20.166 --> 00:00:21.933
Please say I can't send you away

10
00:00:21.933 --> 00:00:24.300
It doesn't matter, Miss Hu's health is important

11
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.566
Leave me alone

12
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.366
Yes, Miss Hu, we can do it ourselves

13
00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.433
Bring him with me

14
00:00:32.166 --> 00:00:33.266
By the way, Master Yang

15
00:00:33.266 --> 00:00:34.600
What do you want to ask him?

16
00:00:36.566 --> 00:00:39.166
In fact, there is nothing wrong with Dean Xu

17
00:00:39.166 --> 00:00:40.266
Grandpa Hou

18
00:00:40.266 --> 00:00:43.466
It is true that there was a problem with the body before coming to the hospital

19
00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.100
I'm not surprised he can't check it out

20
00:00:46.266 --> 00:00:47.966
After all, his medical skills are limited

21
00:00:47.966 --> 00:00:49.266
Yes Yes Yes Yes

22
00:00:49.266 --> 00:00:50.400
My medical skills are limited

23
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:51.466
It's just that

24
00:00:51.466 --> 00:00:52.633
I'm curious.

25
00:00:53.066 --> 00:00:54.966
How did this old man Liang know?

26
00:00:54.966 --> 00:00:57.166
Grandpa Hou has a problem with his body

27
00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:58.566
This Sun Eleven

28
00:00:58.566 --> 00:00:59.966
Not every day

29
00:00:59.966 --> 00:01:02.200
Stay with this old man

30
00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.300
Master Yang means
