00:00:00.666 --> 00:00:01.466
Heh.

2
00:00:01.933 --> 00:00:04.566
Okay, Miss He, did you hear that?

3
00:00:04.566 --> 00:00:06.533
This guy actually took himself to the stall

4
00:00:06.533 --> 00:00:08.300
I bought it for 500 yuan

5
00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:09.633
Xidan mathematics

6
00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:11.466
Still fading the hemagnetism here

7
00:00:11.466 --> 00:00:13.600
I dislike other college presidents to buy something

8
00:00:14.133 --> 00:00:15.400
So shameless

9
00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:16.533
I think you're right.

10
00:00:16.533 --> 00:00:18.000
It's okay if we're here

11
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.900
But why is this thing picked here?

12
00:00:21.366 --> 00:00:23.800
Then I also brought a cheap one.

13
00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.600
500 bucks bargain

14
00:00:25.666 --> 00:00:27.733
Who said no?

15
00:00:27.733 --> 00:00:29.766
Senior even if you buy counterfeit

16
00:00:29.766 --> 00:00:32.600
But at least people are so interested, what about him?

17
00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:35.600
The gift from Lord Hou is 500 yuan, hahaha.

18
00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.566
No, I heard you right.

19
00:00:37.566 --> 00:00:39.466
After all, it is also the Shoushan of the monkey master

20
00:00:39.466 --> 00:00:42.600
You can put a gift of 500 yuan on the table.

21
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.400
Hahaha, Yang Ming, Yang Ming

22
00:00:45.566 --> 00:00:47.466
You've been talking here for a long time

23
00:00:47.466 --> 00:00:49.800
I thought you were amazing

24
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.133
Dean Qu took out 300,000 uncomfortable

25
00:00:53.133 --> 00:00:56.200
How dare you move here for 500 yuan?

26
00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:57.900
Where do you think this is?

27
00:00:57.966 --> 00:01:01.633
What about your poor mountain valley, hahaha?

28
00:01:01.666 --> 00:01:03.866
This is the lifespan of the monkey master

29
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:06.666
Mr. Monkey is in our East Garden, that's De

30
00:01:06.666 --> 00:01:07.666
Your expectations are high.

31
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:11.466
Even if we miss, we have a lot of respect for him

32
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.966
The enemy you bought for 500 bucks

33
00:01:13.966 --> 00:01:16.600
You are clearly humiliating him

34
00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:18.166
Yang Chao, Mr. Liang

35
00:01:18.466 --> 00:01:19.900
You really are a clown

36
00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:21.166
I know how to jump all day

37
00:01:21.666 --> 00:01:26.666
How do you know I paid 500 for something worth 500.

38
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:28.500
Yo

39
00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.433
Yang Ming shouldn't say that he cut his hair, right?

40
00:01:32.533 --> 00:01:33.600
Sure

41
00:01:33.733 --> 00:01:36.233
Then you take your out-point pen

42
00:01:36.733 --> 00:01:39.300
It is more valuable than whose acceptance

43
00:01:39.333 --> 00:01:42.266
Compare who is more respected, okay?
