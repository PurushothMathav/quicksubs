00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.900
Stop! Stop! Stop

2
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:08.366
Brother, be careful

3
00:00:09.733 --> 00:00:12.433
Xiaotao's reporter will see you today

4
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:14.900
Stop

5
00:00:17.866 --> 00:00:19.466
Liang Shao, I will handle it.

6
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.266
Yang Min, what are you doing here?

7
00:00:24.266 --> 00:00:26.266
I've made it very clear to you.

8
00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:27.966
I will not marry

9
00:00:27.966 --> 00:00:29.566
It's useless for you to make trouble

10
00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:31.500
narcissistic

11
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.500
You Mr. Liang

12
00:00:33.666 --> 00:00:36.566
I'm here today to return to our cemetery

13
00:00:37.966 --> 00:00:40.866
I have already sold Zhang Min's cemetery to the Liang family

14
00:00:40.866 --> 00:00:42.200
What's wrong with you?

15
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.233
Nervous Hu Limin

16
00:00:44.966 --> 00:00:45.733
You slander me

17
00:00:45.733 --> 00:00:47.866
Rape you and force my mother to sell you the land

18
00:00:47.866 --> 00:00:49.900
Then you resell it to you.

19
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.900
Now I'm going to send my dad out again

20
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.433
You say I'm crazy

21
00:00:53.466 --> 00:00:55.433
Hu Limin, do you still have this face?

22
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:00.966
Okay, Yang Ming

23
00:01:00.966 --> 00:01:03.600
Obviously, you are reluctant to cover the bill.

24
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.000
My daughter wants to break up with you.

25
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.400
You... you wanted to insult him?

26
00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.766
Fortunately, the police caught him.

27
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.400
This is your mother who can't afford to live

28
00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.233
Sister He gave us this land for her sake

29
00:01:15.266 --> 00:01:17.700
How dare you talk nonsense here

30
00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.366
And you're yelling at me?

31
00:01:19.466 --> 00:01:21.533
Why don't I give you money?

32
00:01:21.533 --> 00:01:24.000
Don't you spend the money my brother earns for him?

33
00:01:24.766 --> 00:01:26.800
Just the little money your brother earned that month

34
00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.033
It's not enough. We obviously bought a bag.

35
00:01:29.133 --> 00:01:30.500
What is the most important thing?

36
00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.233
A girl's youth is priceless, do you understand?

37
00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.233
I'm not here today to dig old scores with you

38
00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:42.100
I can do without the wedding room and the bride price.

39
00:01:42.333 --> 00:01:43.933
But our cemetery

40
00:01:43.933 --> 00:01:46.033
You must pay me back today
