1
00:00:12.533 --> 00:00:15.833
Now it's up to the defendant to explain

2
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:19.700
5 cm.

3
00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.766
Where did I offend you?

4
00:00:22.766 --> 00:00:24.500
We're getting married soon

5
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.500
Why do you say I raped you?

6
00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.766
How many times have we done nothing?

7
00:00:28.766 --> 00:00:29.866
What is the matter with you

8
00:00:29.866 --> 00:00:32.000
Why are you so fierce?

9
00:00:32.333 --> 00:00:33.966
Lawyer, did you see that?

10
00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:35.633
Really threatening my daughter

11
00:00:35.666 --> 00:00:37.066
Yang Ming'er, let me tell you

12
00:00:37.066 --> 00:00:40.300
If you dare to be rude to you again, I will fight you and go to jail

13
00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.400
In-laws, look at this

14
00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:45.200
Let's reconcile this marriage, right?

15
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.300
What are we getting married for?

16
00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:47.700
This marriage can't be done

17
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.266
Marrying such a stingy man

18
00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:50.966
We must have suffered in the past

19
00:00:50.966 --> 00:00:53.300
I've been stingy for so long

20
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.933
Ask the rudeness yourself what I didn't promise him

21
00:00:55.933 --> 00:00:57.433
I'm still stingy

22
00:00:58.333 --> 00:01:00.566
Is that right? Then I said that Maotai should be used for marriage.

23
00:01:00.566 --> 00:01:01.866
Why don't you agree?

24
00:01:01.866 --> 00:01:04.033
You have to be greedy for petty cheap and use Wuliangye

25
00:01:05.133 --> 00:01:08.066
Okay, I promise to understand you and take a step back.

26
00:01:08.066 --> 00:01:09.200
What about the drive-away fee?

27
00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.566
Why don't you agree?

28
00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.433
I didn't promise anything, I'm embarrassed to say it here

29
00:01:13.466 --> 00:01:15.266
Yang Min, let me tell you

30
00:01:15.266 --> 00:01:16.666
It's over between us

31
00:01:16.666 --> 00:01:18.000
I can't be poor like you

32
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.300
You give me poor days

33
00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:22.966
38,000 opening fee, your mouth is 188,000

34
00:01:22.966 --> 00:01:25.466
That's 150,000 not 15 bucks

35
00:01:25.466 --> 00:01:27.566
Don't you know what's going on in our house?

36
00:01:27.566 --> 00:01:28.666
That's your family business.

37
00:01:28.666 --> 00:01:29.900
Who is bothering me?

38
00:01:30.666 --> 00:01:31.466
Dryad

39
00:01:33.133 --> 00:01:34.400
Oh, what about Minmin?

40
00:01:34.566 --> 00:01:35.566
What about this?

41
00:01:35.566 --> 00:01:38.766
We can discuss it again, or let's reconcile first.

42
00:01:38.766 --> 00:01:41.700
Let's go out and find a place to talk slowly, okay?

43
00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.266
You want to make peace with us?

44
00:01:43.466 --> 00:01:44.266
OK

45
00:01:44.333 --> 00:01:47.866
Give you a chance 180,000 can't lose eight points

46
00:01:47.866 --> 00:01:50.800
Otherwise, I will definitely make your son a boss

47
00:01:51.733 --> 00:01:53.466
We don't have that kind of money.

48
00:01:53.466 --> 00:01:57.066
I don't have that much money for your son to be a bachelor.

49
00:01:57.066 --> 00:01:59.766
Are you trying to trick my girl into serving you?

50
00:01:59.766 --> 00:02:01.133
You've buried half of the people

51
00:02:01.133 --> 00:02:03.666
That's beautiful, old crazy woman, what are you talking about?

52
00:02:03.666 --> 00:02:05.266
Why do you want to hit someone?

53
00:02:05.366 --> 00:02:07.733
Tell you there is no 180,000 eight today

54
00:02:07.733 --> 00:02:10.233
There is no cleaning wood for the door.

55
00:02:10.533 --> 00:02:13.400
But our family really doesn't have that much money.

56
00:02:13.566 --> 00:02:14.700
Can't take it out

57
00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.366
Don't you still have an ancestral cemetery in your house?

58
00:02:17.366 --> 00:02:18.533
Take it out!

59
00:02:18.533 --> 00:02:21.500
Take it out and we'll settle with you.

60
00:02:23.466 --> 00:02:25.900
I see it now.

61
00:02:26.366 --> 00:02:30.866
Fox, you came to my cemetery

62
00:02:31.566 --> 00:02:33.900
I'll tell you what, I'll put it here today

63
00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.466
Even if I confess

64
00:02:35.466 --> 00:02:37.100
You're not going to get there.

65
00:02:37.566 --> 00:02:39.800
What confession?

66
00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:43.333
That's right, I, Yang Ming, plead guilty

67
00:02:43.333 --> 00:02:45.200
I just raped him 5cm.

68
00:02:45.266 --> 00:02:46.900
The big deal is that I go in and stay for a few years

69
00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.900
I'm still a good man when I come out

70
00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.533
But your family has no way about the cemetery

71
00:02:51.533 --> 00:02:52.333
you

72
00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.033
Okay, then you go in and stay

73
00:02:57.666 --> 00:02:59.466
Mom let's go

74
00:03:03.733 --> 00:03:04.833
Millennium running-in

75
00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.433
I beg you.

76
00:03:06.533 --> 00:03:08.000
My son is young.

77
00:03:08.333 --> 00:03:11.566
If he goes in, his life will be ruined

78
00:03:11.933 --> 00:03:13.166
I beg you.

79
00:03:13.166 --> 00:03:15.266
What's your son's life to me?

80
00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:18.066
Go away mom
