00:00:00.733 --> 00:00:03.200
I knew it

2
00:00:03.466 --> 00:00:04.900
Can I marry you?

3
00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:08.366
It is a blessing that I have cultivated in three lifetimes.

4
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:15.700
There was an incident

5
00:00:16.133 --> 00:00:17.633
I want to tell you

6
00:00:19.166 --> 00:00:20.200
Anything will do

7
00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:21.766
How old am I?

8
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.000
Not a big deal

9
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.066
It's about the change fee.

10
00:00:33.466 --> 00:00:34.766
Have to discuss again

11
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.066
Isn't the change fee all discussed?

12
00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:43.300
My mom thinks thirty-eight thousand is too ugly

13
00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.766
3838 seems to be scolding me

14
00:00:46.766 --> 00:00:50.400
So we have to discuss it again. Okay.

15
00:00:50.766 --> 00:00:53.233
I will listen to you as much as you want.

16
00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.700
How about 188,000?

17
00:00:56.766 --> 00:00:59.500
It means that the hair is good.

18
00:00:59.966 --> 00:01:03.666
188,000 is a bit too much

19
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.200
That's more, Yang Min.

20
00:01:06.333 --> 00:01:08.066
I want to marry into your family

21
00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.733
I have been married to my mother for over 20 years

22
00:01:09.733 --> 00:01:11.133
Now suddenly let me change my mind

23
00:01:11.133 --> 00:01:13.366
My girlfriends are all two or three hundred thousand

24
00:01:13.366 --> 00:01:15.200
I want you 180,000

25
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.400
That's too much.

26
00:01:16.966 --> 00:01:18.833
No, Minmin, listen to me explain.

27
00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:20.066
Oops no

28
00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.266
Minmin, our family wants to marry you

29
00:01:23.266 --> 00:01:24.633
Just bought a house

30
00:01:24.666 --> 00:01:26.200
Decoration and dowry

31
00:01:26.533 --> 00:01:27.800
And planning a wedding

32
00:01:28.166 --> 00:01:30.166
I really can't get any money.

33
00:01:30.166 --> 00:01:31.566
How about a little less?

34
00:01:31.866 --> 00:01:33.500
58,000 I want to send

35
00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.466
Doesn't that sound auspicious?

36
00:01:35.866 --> 00:01:37.900
When I wanted to change Moutai to Wuliangye just now

37
00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:39.233
What am I saying?

38
00:01:39.533 --> 00:01:42.333
Oh, co-author, I'll let your family save some money.

39
00:01:42.333 --> 00:01:45.166
You bargain with me, right?

40
00:01:46.966 --> 00:01:48.900
Rice noodles rice noodles

41
00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:52.000
My family is really out of money, no money

42
00:01:52.166 --> 00:01:53.133
Not really.

43
00:01:53.133 --> 00:01:56.100
Don't you still have an ancestral cemetery in your house?

44
00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.500
Cemeteries are so expensive these days

45
00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.466
It's not a problem to sell 400,000 or 500,000 casually

46
00:02:00.866 --> 00:02:04.700
Oh, Yang Min doesn't want to marry me, does it?

47
00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:05.800
No.

48
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.533
This purpose is passed down by my family.

49
00:02:08.533 --> 00:02:10.633
You can't do that. You can't do that.

50
00:02:10.733 --> 00:02:12.800
It's just to make me feel wronged, isn't it?

51
00:02:13.733 --> 00:02:15.733
My dad died early in this cemetery

52
00:02:15.733 --> 00:02:17.566
Just my mother for so many years

53
00:02:17.566 --> 00:02:18.666
The only wish is

54
00:02:18.666 --> 00:02:20.166
To be buried with him when he dies

55
00:02:20.166 --> 00:02:22.400
So this cemetery can't be sold

56
00:02:23.066 --> 00:02:25.800
Okay, Yao Min, don't regret it.

57
00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.866
I'm not getting married either.

58
00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:30.233
Minmin Minmin
