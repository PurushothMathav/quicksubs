1
00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:01.300
Auction house

2
00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:02.900
This time I bet you and me three

3
00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:03.866
Finally, you screwed it.

4
00:00:03.866 --> 00:00:05.666
So Liangjia's auction house

5
00:00:05.666 --> 00:00:06.566
The remaining auction houses

6
00:00:06.566 --> 00:00:08.800
And my antique shop is all yours

7
00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:12.033
Aren't we together?

8
00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:13.066
How about Mr. Sheng?

9
00:00:13.066 --> 00:00:14.166
Also put your auction house

10
00:00:14.166 --> 00:00:15.733
And the antique store for me

11
00:00:15.733 --> 00:00:18.066
And I can't operate it either.

12
00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:19.266
willing to admit defeat

13
00:00:19.266 --> 00:00:21.300
My Sage has always been straightforward

14
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:22.800
Today without Master Yang

15
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.466
I still don't know how to do it

16
00:00:24.466 --> 00:00:26.166
And the collaboration with monkeys is also

17
00:00:26.166 --> 00:00:27.800
For the sake of saving Old Monkey

18
00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.800
Master Yang, please don't refuse

19
00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.866
Ok but I really don't know how to run

20
00:00:33.133 --> 00:00:34.100
That's easy to say.

21
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.366
What if you want to operate?

22
00:00:35.366 --> 00:00:36.400
Then try it yourself

23
00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:37.600
If you don't want to

24
00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.000
Then find a professional team

25
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.366
It's the same for them to operate

26
00:00:40.366 --> 00:00:42.800
You just need to find a professional to supervise it.

27
00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.100
Let me try.

28
00:00:48.066 --> 00:00:50.866
Zhang Weidong is my Master Liang

29
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:52.833
Well, Mingren doesn't say secret words?

30
00:00:53.266 --> 00:00:56.666
My ancestors did somersaults haha

31
00:00:56.666 --> 00:00:58.166
That incense burner uh

32
00:00:58.166 --> 00:01:00.766
That Kyushu tripod was unearthed?

33
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:02.200
Ha ha.

34
00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:04.366
In fact, to our generation

35
00:01:04.366 --> 00:01:05.966
I don't do this anymore

36
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.300
That's what my father used to leave behind

37
00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:09.866
I think you are free

38
00:01:09.866 --> 00:01:11.066
Go to my place to have a look.

39
00:01:11.066 --> 00:01:12.700
Other items my father left behind

40
00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.866
Well, of course, if you're busy, I'll definitely help.

41
00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:18.566
Ok hehe
