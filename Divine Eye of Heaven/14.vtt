00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.666
Hey, isn't this Miss Guangda Guan Ya?

2
00:00:02.666 --> 00:00:03.933
I saw him on TV.

3
00:00:03.933 --> 00:00:06.666
The eldest lady of the richest family will ride to our East Garden

4
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:08.333
Are you here to make trouble?

5
00:00:08.333 --> 00:00:09.466
Who gave you the guts?

6
00:00:09.466 --> 00:00:11.666
So much for our key benefactor?

7
00:00:12.266 --> 00:00:13.500
What to do now

8
00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:15.833
Hahahaha Miss Guan

9
00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:17.766
A misunderstanding

10
00:00:17.766 --> 00:00:20.666
We didn't know you had this relationship either

11
00:00:20.733 --> 00:00:23.000
Oh, this is not a big flood to wash away the Dragon King Temple

12
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.466
Does the family not recognize the family? Hahaha

13
00:00:25.466 --> 00:00:28.800
Your mother's family also cooperated with us to turn off the keyboard relatives

14
00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:31.566
Oh, a high slip of the tongue, a slip of the tongue, it's me

15
00:00:31.566 --> 00:00:33.933
Then what do you think about the eldest lady?

16
00:00:33.933 --> 00:00:35.166
How to deal with it?

17
00:00:35.266 --> 00:00:36.766
Shouldn't have asked me

18
00:00:36.766 --> 00:00:39.200
Hahaha, yes, yes, yes, you are right.

19
00:00:39.933 --> 00:00:43.933
Mr. Yang, this is my son's fault

20
00:00:43.933 --> 00:00:45.366
You have a lot.

21
00:00:45.366 --> 00:00:46.600
You forgive him

22
00:00:46.866 --> 00:00:48.700
Our Liang family is willing to pay compensation

23
00:00:49.333 --> 00:00:50.133
10 million

24
00:00:50.666 --> 00:00:52.066
10 million, what do you think?

25
00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:54.100
What do you think, Mr. Yang?

26
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:58.033
Dig up my dad's ashes from the grave

27
00:00:58.666 --> 00:01:00.433
Then fell to the ground

28
00:01:00.566 --> 00:01:02.200
10 million

29
00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.466
Because that's how rich people play with us.

30
00:01:04.466 --> 00:01:05.666
The feelings of the poor?

31
00:01:05.666 --> 00:01:08.466
Yang Ming, don't toast, don't eat and be fined

32
00:01:08.466 --> 00:01:11.066
Shut up, your father

33
00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.266
Mr. Yang, what Xiaotao did just now was indeed too much

34
00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:17.666
I brought him to apologize to you

35
00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.533
What do you say?

36
00:01:19.533 --> 00:01:20.800
You draw a path.

37
00:01:20.866 --> 00:01:23.266
Our Liang family tries our best to satisfy

38
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.400
Mr. Yang

39
00:01:24.933 --> 00:01:28.266
Brother, we have got the purpose back.

40
00:01:30.366 --> 00:01:33.233
Can I buy his leg for 10 million?

41
00:01:34.533 --> 00:01:35.800
I think it's reasonable.

42
00:01:35.966 --> 00:01:38.133
Someone do it

43
00:01:38.133 --> 00:01:41.000
No no no no no no

44
00:01:41.933 --> 00:01:44.600
Ahaha dad

45
00:01:44.666 --> 00:01:46.366
You are the only son.

46
00:01:46.366 --> 00:01:47.733
I can't live without legs.

47
00:01:47.733 --> 00:01:49.466
Dad let go

48
00:01:50.166 --> 00:01:51.266
Ah!

49
00:01:58.666 --> 00:02:01.166
I was wrong, I was wrong, Yang Ming, I'm sorry.

50
00:02:01.166 --> 00:02:02.866
Don't break my leg!

51
00:02:02.866 --> 00:02:05.766
I don't want the bride price house anymore, I won't return it to you.

52
00:02:05.766 --> 00:02:09.366
Mr. Mother, I think this matter is over

53
00:02:11.666 --> 00:02:13.600
Tomorrow, your family will send someone immediately.

54
00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.366
Give this cemetery back

55
00:02:18.966 --> 00:02:21.500
Mr. Yao, my grandfather has been wanting to see you for a long time

56
00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:22.800
Come with me.

57
00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:24.600
brother

58
00:02:25.666 --> 00:02:28.800
Xiaoxue, go back and take care of our mother's cemetery first

59
00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.233
Wait for them to find someone to do it tomorrow.

60
00:02:31.333 --> 00:02:33.466
I'll go with Miss Guan

61
00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.433
Give me this.

62
00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.666
Come and see Miss Guan off, let's go

63
00:02:43.466 --> 00:02:44.300
Ah!

64
00:02:45.266 --> 00:02:47.366
My leg

65
00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.166
Master Liang, don't worry.

66
00:02:50.333 --> 00:02:53.233
I will not let Liang Shaobai suffer this humiliation
