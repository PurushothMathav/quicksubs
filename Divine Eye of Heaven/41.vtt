00:00:00.866 --> 00:00:03.600
How dare anyone come to my store to make trouble?

2
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:04.433
You tell me.

3
00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:06.200
If you dare to touch us

4
00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:07.566
I will give it to the market immediately.

5
00:00:07.566 --> 00:00:09.366
Regulators call to report

6
00:00:10.266 --> 00:00:11.566
I'm afraid you will report it.

7
00:00:11.566 --> 00:00:13.800
I'm afraid you don't know this store

8
00:00:14.166 --> 00:00:15.133
Who is covering it?

9
00:00:15.133 --> 00:00:17.266
No matter who it is, it is bigger than the law

10
00:00:18.066 --> 00:00:20.266
Haha, I might as well tell you.

11
00:00:20.266 --> 00:00:24.233
My brother-in-law works for Goldman Sachs

12
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.000
That's in our plateau city

13
00:00:26.733 --> 00:00:29.966
He is also one of the big people who eat black and white

14
00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.000
Don't say you called to report

15
00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.100
It's the people in the marketing takeover department

16
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.966
I tell him to go back and forth from where

17
00:00:37.766 --> 00:00:39.166
O saint

18
00:00:39.166 --> 00:00:42.700
You poor man still know Mr. Sheng's name

19
00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:44.366
That depends on Mr. Sheng's face

20
00:00:44.366 --> 00:00:46.166
Make up the price difference of this medicine.

21
00:00:46.166 --> 00:00:47.600
It's over

22
00:00:48.266 --> 00:00:51.866
Hahahahaha hey

23
00:00:52.266 --> 00:00:55.066
Return it to you, are you thinking too much?

24
00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.566
Come here and block him for me

25
00:00:57.566 --> 00:00:58.833
Don't let him go

26
00:01:02.933 --> 00:01:06.866
Yo, this chick is so watery

27
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.533
Why don't you come with me and play a few games of poker in the back?

28
00:01:10.533 --> 00:01:11.900
I'll let you go

29
00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:12.533
How did it go?

30
00:01:12.533 --> 00:01:15.033
Dare to touch a hair of my sister, try it

31
00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:19.833
Your sister, don't say it's frozen with hair

32
00:01:19.966 --> 00:01:21.900
I'll go to Hook later

33
00:01:21.966 --> 00:01:24.400
Play a good level of poker with him

34
00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:25.700
What are you doing?

35
00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.900
Come on, don't move

36
00:01:28.866 --> 00:01:29.800
Tell you what?

37
00:01:29.866 --> 00:01:31.900
I have your phone number, Mr. Sheng

38
00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:34.133
Do you know Mr. Sheng's temper?

39
00:01:34.133 --> 00:01:38.233
If you offend him, he won't have your head

40
00:01:39.666 --> 00:01:42.900
4 6s, isn't this the tail number of Mr. Sheng's mobile phone?

41
00:01:42.933 --> 00:01:45.866
It's a coincidence that you know Mr. Sheng

42
00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.000
Is he going to say something next?

43
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.933
This phone number is from Mr. Sheng.

44
00:01:49.933 --> 00:01:52.233
That's right, Mr. Sheng

45
00:01:52.466 --> 00:01:54.100
You said that Mr. Sheng is Mr. Sheng

46
00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:55.900
I also said that in my phone

47
00:01:56.066 --> 00:01:58.200
There is a key call from the richest man

48
00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.733
Do you want to call you?

49
00:01:59.733 --> 00:02:02.600
So you don't even know Mr. Sheng's phone number?

50
00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.466
It seems that you are not even a dog leg

51
00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.333
Mr. Yang, you finally answered the phone.

52
00:02:09.333 --> 00:02:10.200
I guess you're right.

53
00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.866
I really had a car accident, Mr. Yang

54
00:02:11.933 --> 00:02:13.766
Yesterday was all my fault

55
00:02:13.766 --> 00:02:15.366
Please don't know me in general
