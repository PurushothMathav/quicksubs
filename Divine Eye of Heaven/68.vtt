00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:06.366
What's so great about this ancient wall?

2
00:00:06.366 --> 00:00:08.066
He is a modern imitation

3
00:00:08.066 --> 00:00:10.433
And the imitation is very cracked. Shut up.

4
00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:14.500
Mr. Xue, it seems that the program has changed.

5
00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:17.433
Mr. Xue, can you see what this is?

6
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.300
Can't see

7
00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.766
But Liang Wanfeng's words didn't leave

8
00:00:22.066 --> 00:00:23.966
This village is not even worthy of walking

9
00:00:23.966 --> 00:00:26.233
There should be no suspense.

10
00:00:26.466 --> 00:00:29.666
But why am I so excited?

11
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:31.600
I don't know.

12
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.200
Could this be right?

13
00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.800
This is one of the top of Kyushu

14
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.166
That's right, it's wine and meat

15
00:00:45.166 --> 00:00:47.833
The record above also has this pattern

16
00:00:47.966 --> 00:00:49.800
Haha this texture

17
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.100
I said how can such a big top be lost?

18
00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.066
Later generations can only imitate the sun and redo it

19
00:00:54.066 --> 00:00:55.566
Haha, so?

20
00:00:55.566 --> 00:00:56.966
He is so small

21
00:00:56.966 --> 00:00:59.300
I heard that this top is made of iron from outer clouds

22
00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:00.700
No rust, no corrosion.

23
00:01:01.333 --> 00:01:02.400
I really do

24
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.966
Haha, think about it.

25
00:01:04.966 --> 00:01:07.166
How could such a large piece of metal fall from the sky?

26
00:01:07.533 --> 00:01:09.166
The material itself is limited

27
00:01:09.166 --> 00:01:11.166
It is also possible to cast 9 cattle

28
00:01:11.266 --> 00:01:12.900
How can it be big?

29
00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.266
Dad, you can't read it wrong, can you?

30
00:01:15.266 --> 00:01:18.500
How could I read your dad wrong if you don't make such a thing?

31
00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.166
Can you witness this history in this lifetime?

32
00:01:21.166 --> 00:01:22.800
No matter what?

33
00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.666
This is Jiutoulingna

34
00:01:25.133 --> 00:01:26.866
Isn't that priceless?
