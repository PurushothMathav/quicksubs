00:00:00.466 --> 00:00:02.800
Boss, why are you here?

2
00:00:02.866 --> 00:00:05.466
If I don't come, I'll be called a black store

3
00:00:05.466 --> 00:00:08.566
This is going to spread out to the antique circle in Dongyuan City

4
00:00:08.566 --> 00:00:11.266
Don't you have to poke my saint lord's spine?

5
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.100
Mr. Sheng, look at what you said

6
00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:15.466
In the entire Dongyuan City, who dares to speak of you?

7
00:00:15.466 --> 00:00:16.500
Who dares to speak to you

8
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.666
I immediately had his tongue pulled out

9
00:00:18.666 --> 00:00:19.766
What does that mean?

10
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.400
When have I ever cut someone's tongue?

11
00:00:23.133 --> 00:00:25.166
Look at my mouth, it should be beaten

12
00:00:26.366 --> 00:00:28.400
Mr. Shen, it's like this

13
00:00:28.666 --> 00:00:29.600
This guy?

14
00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:32.600
I want to use a modern craft imitation to cheat money here

15
00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:35.533
Money is better, spend 10 bucks on his stuff

16
00:00:35.533 --> 00:00:38.166
But he's still messing around here

17
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:39.266
also said

18
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.533
You also said that your store is a black store.

19
00:00:42.533 --> 00:00:44.366
I can't take this anymore.

20
00:00:44.366 --> 00:00:47.033
You must teach him a good lesson.

21
00:00:47.566 --> 00:00:48.366
Tian Lao

22
00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:49.966
Is that what happened?

23
00:00:49.966 --> 00:00:51.300
Ah, that's right, Mr. Sheng

24
00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.766
I thought I could get away with it with a little money

25
00:00:53.766 --> 00:00:56.766
I didn't expect him to kick his nose and talk nonsense

26
00:00:56.766 --> 00:00:59.100
You obviously hacked my sewing box

27
00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:00.733
little brother

28
00:01:00.733 --> 00:01:03.433
My sage has always been open and upright in doing business

29
00:01:03.533 --> 00:01:05.900
Why don't you show me the sewing box?

30
00:01:05.933 --> 00:01:07.900
How is it?

31
00:01:08.066 --> 00:01:10.466
Trying to steal my sewing box and hack it?

32
00:01:10.466 --> 00:01:12.100
Fart us

33
00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.700
Tens of billions of heroes will care about your broken box.

34
00:01:14.766 --> 00:01:17.800
Shut up, is this your place to speak? Back off

35
00:01:19.133 --> 00:01:19.966
little brother

36
00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.366
I know you've suffered a lot here today

37
00:01:22.366 --> 00:01:23.933
So you say the number.

38
00:01:23.933 --> 00:01:25.333
I'll transfer the money to you first.

39
00:01:25.333 --> 00:01:28.700
Then how about you give me the sewing box?

40
00:01:29.133 --> 00:01:31.800
Mr. Sheng, this is against the rules
