00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:02.100
Shengjun, what do you mean?

2
00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:03.966
Do you want to be right with my mother's family?

3
00:00:03.966 --> 00:00:07.666
Don't forget that my birthday gift was also bought from you.

4
00:00:07.666 --> 00:00:10.166
Our family gives you face like this

5
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.066
You disgust me so much.

6
00:00:12.066 --> 00:00:14.700
Yang Tao, you don't think what your parents did

7
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.366
I'll never know

8
00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:18.666
Miss Ou, tell me

9
00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:20.600
Let Master Yang in or not

10
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.433
If Master Yang is not your craft

11
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.833
Then I don't need to participate.

12
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.666
Since Mr. Sheng has spoken

13
00:00:26.666 --> 00:00:28.400
Then forget it.

14
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.833
However, I still want to advise Mr. Sheng

15
00:00:30.933 --> 00:00:34.033
Some rivers and lakes deceive, don't be sober

16
00:00:34.066 --> 00:00:35.700
Okay, Yang Ming.

17
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.433
Since you have an invitation

18
00:00:37.566 --> 00:00:39.633
I won't say anything else, but

19
00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.900
This is Grandpa Hou's birthday banquet

20
00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:45.200
At least bring something

21
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.033
Come to the birthday banquet without taking it

22
00:00:48.366 --> 00:00:51.066
Didn't your mother teach you any etiquette?

23
00:00:51.133 --> 00:00:53.200
Who said I didn't bring a gift?

24
00:00:55.166 --> 00:00:57.800
This broken box looks like it was bought at a roadside stall

25
00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.400
You poor dick, that's all there is to it

26
00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:01.733
As the saying goes

27
00:01:01.733 --> 00:01:03.066
Courtesy is light and affection is heavy

28
00:01:03.066 --> 00:01:04.266
How about Mr. Hou?

29
00:01:04.266 --> 00:01:05.900
See how much the gift is worth

30
00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.766
To determine whether this person is sincere in selling?

31
00:01:08.766 --> 00:01:10.633
Yang Ming, you are talking nonsense.

32
00:01:11.133 --> 00:01:13.200
How could my father be so shallow?

33
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.400
But that's what he meant just now at 5 cm.

34
00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.700
I didn't say my throat is shallow.

35
00:01:17.733 --> 00:01:20.066
Besides, my congratulatory gift?

36
00:01:20.066 --> 00:01:23.766
Whether it is light or heavy depends on whether you know the goods or not.

37
00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.600
Isn't it just Mr. Sheng supporting him?

38
00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.766
Look at him like a nouveau riche

39
00:01:30.766 --> 00:01:32.166
I'm convinced

40
00:01:32.166 --> 00:01:36.233
Wait and see, I must make him look good today
