Hey brother

2
00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:06.400
How do you pay 2 million medical bills?

3
00:00:09.566 --> 00:00:12.766
Mom, where did this sewing box come from?

4
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.900
I remember it was many years ago

5
00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:18.633
I don't know where your dad got it back

6
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.066
I see it. This style is nice.

7
00:00:21.066 --> 00:00:22.600
I've been using him

8
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.333
What's wrong bro

9
00:00:24.333 --> 00:00:26.666
I asked you about the hospital 2 million

10
00:00:26.866 --> 00:00:28.866
What are you studying this broken sewing box for?

11
00:00:28.866 --> 00:00:31.866
Could it be that this sewing box can still be stored 2 million?

12
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.066
If I'm right

13
00:00:34.066 --> 00:00:35.300
This sewing box

14
00:00:35.333 --> 00:00:36.566
It will be returned easily.

15
00:00:36.566 --> 00:00:38.166
Increase 2 million medical expenses

16
00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:41.066
It's no less

17
00:00:41.066 --> 00:00:42.633
How to talk nonsense

18
00:00:42.866 --> 00:00:45.700
Could it be that this sewing box is still an antique?

19
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.166
Well, you were right.

20
00:00:47.266 --> 00:00:48.200
What's this for?

21
00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:49.000
It just sounds good.

22
00:00:49.466 --> 00:00:51.300
It's true. It's true.

23
00:00:53.966 --> 00:00:56.533
Hey, what are you doing?

24
00:00:56.533 --> 00:00:57.700
I have an old object here

25
00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:59.133
If you want to change some money, you should be in a hurry.

26
00:00:59.133 --> 00:01:00.900
Is this Goldman Sachs Antique Store?

27
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:02.633
Money exchange emergency

28
00:01:03.733 --> 00:01:05.066
Just such a crap

29
00:01:05.366 --> 00:01:06.300
Stinky dick

30
00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:09.533
Do you know what Goldman Sachs Antique Shop is?

31
00:01:09.533 --> 00:01:11.066
Not an antique store?

32
00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.566
I'm really in a hurry

33
00:01:12.566 --> 00:01:14.800
So I want to take the online shopping award for cash emergency

34
00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.333
Antique store? Are you kidding me?

35
00:01:17.333 --> 00:01:20.366
This is a high-tech company owned by Goldman Sachs

36
00:01:20.366 --> 00:01:21.400
Duan Antique Store

37
00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.400
Do you understand high-end?

38
00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:26.300
We don't accept fakes here.

39
00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.600
Get out of here with your bad thing

40
00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:30.533
Roll roll roll roll roll

41
00:01:30.533 --> 00:01:33.266
It's not that you drove people out without looking at them.

42
00:01:33.266 --> 00:01:35.066
Co-authored, you are an atmospheric guest, right?
