00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.300
Why did someone spend 5 million

2
00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:18.560
I certainly can't tell you that.

3
00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.820
My brother also has professional ethics

4
00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.460
Okay, don't you just want money?

5
00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:29.020
I'll give you 10 million to see mine

6
00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.180
Isn't he just investing in money by helping him?

7
00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.820
In case I kill him

8
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:42.260
After he went in, the money was alive, but he really didn't spend it.

9
00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.640
Who knows if what he said is really money?

10
00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.520
Hey, Sun Wan lied to us.

11
00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.080
Aren't we losing our wives and losing our soldiers?

12
00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:51.340
Which big brother?

13
00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.860
Yun Shenji Family Dong Zong knows, right?

14
00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.060
Ji Lingchuan, president of Jin's Group, is mine

15
00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:58.780
fiancÃ©

16
00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:01.940
You must not be a piece of cake for him

17
00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.060
Ji Lingchuan will block your reputation at a critical moment

18
00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.020
I hope you don't blame me. Uh

19
00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:10.380
You say

20
00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:12.940
President of the Notebook Group

21
00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:14.780
Is your fiancÃ©

22
00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:17.720
You can't believe this.

23
00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:19.120
Lend me your phone

24
00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:20.460
I'll give him a call.

25
00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:23.960
Wow

26
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.200
Then I warn you.

27
00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.380
If you dare to call the police, I will take you under martial law immediately

28
00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.660
Brother, how can I call the police if I am tied up?

29
00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.500
Sister-in-law, I will help you catch him.

30
00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:38.900
Hello six six six six

31
00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:40.620
Let's go let's go

32
00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:44.560
Hello

33
00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:48.240
Mr. Ji

34
00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.740
Your fiancee is in my hands

35
00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:55.100
10 million in cash if you want him to live

36
00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:58.900
Tell me the address.

37
00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.860
The address is in the unfinished building of Linyuanchang

38
00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.460
Lin Chuan, don't forget, don't forget

39
00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.300
I'm in gear.
