00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:05.340
Mrs. Liu, Dr. Qi

2
00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:07.220
Take your time.

3
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:10.800
And so forth.

4
00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:12.180
What's up?

5
00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:15.960
You don't think it tastes right?

6
00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.160
Why isn't that right?

7
00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.840
If you don't eat it, you say it's wrong.

8
00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.160
Did you mean to target me?

9
00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.280
I don't know you.

10
00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:23.440
What are you doing? You don't know me.

11
00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:24.880
Stop pretending

12
00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:26.980
Doctor Qin, the money really doesn't blow, I lose my memory

13
00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.020
Why didn't the car accident kill you?

14
00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:32.200
Ok even if you don't know me

15
00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:33.740
You always have to be serious when you speak

16
00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:36.980
The last time I got a job, you blew it

17
00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:41.000
Do you still want to screw up my work this time? Is this porridge wrong for my mom?

18
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.960
I'm a doctor.

19
00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:43.160
Just smell it

20
00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.560
This meal is all cooked in the kitchen

21
00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:46.760
It doesn't matter to me.

22
00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.620
I'm just in charge of drilling up

23
00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:50.880
What's the problem, do you want to find the chef?

24
00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:52.780
Manager, come here

25
00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:55.240
manager

26
00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:58.000
Ma'am, did something happen?

27
00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.540
Put the surveillance of your restaurant

28
00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.180
Don't turn on the broken surveillance for me.

29
00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.180
If there is no problem, I will compensate you.

30
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.500
If there is a problem, this waiter is up to you.

31
00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.760
Manager, don't listen to their nonsense.

32
00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.320
They're just looking for trouble

33
00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.760
Our military business has been here for so long

34
00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.160
Nothing ever happens.

35
00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.760
This is a matter of our personal level, you do as I say

36
00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:21.700
Otherwise, as a novice in improvement, I am Mrs.

37
00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:23.080
manager

38
00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:27.380
Qin Shiyu, this bitch, is my nemesis
