00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:03.500
How about a doctor?

2
00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:05.260
Mom, save first

3
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.700
I haven't woken up yet.

4
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.460
This is good

5
00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:16.340
How could there be such a serious car accident?

6
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.780
Lin Hao, go check the situation between the dormitory and the car accident.

7
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:24.980
Ok Mr. Ji

8
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.260
I just happen to report to you about one person.

9
00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:30.260
I found out that he seemed to have an affair with Mrs. Shao before

10
00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:32.880
In addition, the Gu family has been short of capital stores recently.

11
00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.340
Gu Yi is looking for someone to raise money

12
00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.140
OK, I see.

13
00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.720
I heard what Lin Hao said just now

14
00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:42.620
We care

15
00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.500
Never allow a woman like Qin Xiaoxuan to marry

16
00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.800
Mom, I can't have a relationship with another man because of Xiaoxian

17
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.060
I don't want him.

18
00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:57.180
Ji Linchuan, why did I give birth to such a stupid and stubborn person as you?

19
00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:01.020
This Gu Yiming is Dr. Qin's fiancé, right?

20
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:05.260
Qin Xiaoxuan was with him before he met you

21
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.140
What good can a woman like him steal her sister's fiancé be?

22
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.020
Mom, did you check him out?

23
00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.240
Of course. Didn't you say you were going to marry him?

24
00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.460
Of course I have to investigate our step-in-law's future daughter-in-law

25
00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.840
Mom, no one else knows

26
00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.260
Don't you know what Mengmeng means to me?

27
00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.880
I know when you were little

28
00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.140
Mom is not optimistic about you

29
00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.460
Let you get lost

30
00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.420
Kidnapped again

31
00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.100
It's that little girl named Mengmeng

32
00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:37.860
She has been with you

33
00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.780
I'd rather starve myself

34
00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.260
I also leave you the food

35
00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.420
Mom is very grateful

36
00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:44.900
But son

37
00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:46.980
People can change

38
00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:49.760
No matter what he becomes

39
00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:51.260
He will always be my dream
