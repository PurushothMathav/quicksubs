00:00:00.533 --> 00:00:01.966
Your Majesty, I believe

2
00:00:01.966 --> 00:00:04.966
it is too hasty to imprison Prince Duan just because of a lamp at the birthday banquet.

3
00:00:04.966 --> 00:00:06.033
It might undermine the royal dignity.

4
00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:08.466
Your Majesty, I suggest reconsideration.

5
00:00:08.466 --> 00:00:10.300
After all, Prince Duan is of royal blood.

6
00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:12.500
Even if he has made a mistake,

7
00:00:12.533 --> 00:00:13.700
he should be treated fairly.

8
00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:16.166
He deserves to be judged according to the law and given a chance to correct his errors.

9
00:00:16.166 --> 00:00:18.366
You should understand the severity of Prince Duan's crime.

10
00:00:18.366 --> 00:00:19.900
What kind of heinous crime he has committed.

11
00:00:20.333 --> 00:00:23.200
This is a serious offense.

12
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.600
By Your Majesty's command,

13
00:00:26.666 --> 00:00:28.433
I investigated Prince Duan’s treason.

14
00:00:28.733 --> 00:00:30.500
The dragon robe and the tiger talisman

15
00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.800
were found in Prince Duan’s residence.

16
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:36.466
Do any of you ministers have anything else to say?

17
00:00:36.766 --> 00:00:37.966
Since ancient times,

18
00:00:38.133 --> 00:00:41.066
the crime of treason has been punishable by death.

19
00:00:41.066 --> 00:00:44.066
I now order that Prince Duan be executed at Linchi.

20
00:00:44.066 --> 00:00:45.966
Do any of you have objections?

21
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:48.900
Your Majesty is wise.

22
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:52.066
Long live the Emperor, long live the Emperor, long, long live the Emperor!

23
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.266
Hospital, hospital.

24
00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.400
Consort, you finally woke up.

25
00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:13.600
I heard,

26
00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.566
last night the consort made a big fuss.

27
00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.133
She kept insisting on seeing the Emperor.

28
00:01:17.133 --> 00:01:18.400
In this life and the previous one,

29
00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.800
I should understand her now, hmm.

30
00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.600
I’ll change clothes and go meet her.
