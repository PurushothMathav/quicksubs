00:00:03.066 --> 00:00:04.833
Empress, are you alright?

2
00:00:05.566 --> 00:00:07.500
Yes, yes.

3
00:00:09.166 --> 00:00:12.566
Hahaha, it seems...

4
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.466
He is truly mad.

5
00:00:15.966 --> 00:00:16.766
Haha.

6
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:18.500
Hmm.

7
00:00:19.333 --> 00:00:20.866
The Duke of End is dead.

8
00:00:20.866 --> 00:00:22.233
The palace concubine is mad.

9
00:00:22.366 --> 00:00:24.133
Then why did the plague

10
00:00:24.133 --> 00:00:25.466
still break out under the Duke of End’s direction?

11
00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.500
It seems the real rebel is someone else.

12
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.900
Your Majesty, Your Majesty.

13
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:35.300
Your Majesty.

14
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:39.466
Your Majesty.

15
00:00:41.266 --> 00:00:42.400
What are you doing here?

16
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.300
Your Majesty, I have something important to discuss.

17
00:00:45.366 --> 00:00:47.200
Your Majesty, even though the Duke of End is dead,

18
00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:48.566
you must not be careless.

19
00:00:48.566 --> 00:00:50.133
The Duke of End may have been just a pawn.

20
00:00:50.133 --> 00:00:51.833
The real culprit may be someone else.

21
00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:53.833
No reaction at all.

22
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:55.400
Could he have known about it already?

23
00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:56.900
How do you know about this?

24
00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.700
I dreamed about it.

25
00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.433
Could it be that he is anxious?

26
00:01:02.466 --> 00:01:05.100
Maybe he doesn’t care anymore.
