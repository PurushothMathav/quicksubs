00:00:00.666 --> 00:00:02.833
When did you start to have doubts?

2
00:00:03.366 --> 00:00:05.233
Your subordinates betrayed you.

3
00:00:05.933 --> 00:00:08.266
Since Wang Momo and I started investigating,

4
00:00:08.333 --> 00:00:09.700
I did indeed find

5
00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:11.700
that you seemed normal and unremarkable.

6
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.800
You are approachable and friendly.

7
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:15.000
Even the released palace maids speak highly of you.

8
00:00:15.366 --> 00:00:17.900
But I noticed that you go to the Imperial Garden every week

9
00:00:18.333 --> 00:00:22.066
to pick balsam flowers.

10
00:00:22.066 --> 00:00:23.433
Quickly, quickly, quickly!

11
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.566
What are they picking flowers for?

12
00:00:36.133 --> 00:00:39.300
Should we go and see what they're doing?

13
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.433
Your Majesty, shall we go over and check?

14
00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:45.800
What’s strange is,

15
00:00:45.866 --> 00:00:47.800
you only pick balsam flowers.

16
00:00:48.466 --> 00:00:50.233
Balsam flowers are mainly used for dyeing.

17
00:00:50.566 --> 00:00:53.466
I only realized that since you entered the palace,

18
00:00:53.466 --> 00:00:55.066
you’ve never shown your own makeup.

19
00:00:55.066 --> 00:00:57.400
Although I don’t know how you used the makeup

20
00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.000
to frame the Empress Dowager,

21
00:00:59.566 --> 00:01:02.666
perhaps you were just fishing for a big catch?

22
00:01:02.733 --> 00:01:04.066
Su Qingyu.

23
00:01:04.733 --> 00:01:08.200
The Emperor has given the Empress Dowager medicine to relieve her symptoms,

24
00:01:08.366 --> 00:01:11.466
so she’s sometimes clear-headed and sometimes confused.

25
00:01:11.533 --> 00:01:13.466
You can’t control the Empress Dowager.

26
00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.866
There will certainly be bigger moves.

27
00:01:17.466 --> 00:01:19.366
You’ve always been the one causing trouble.

28
00:01:19.466 --> 00:01:21.566
My real target was never you.

29
00:01:21.566 --> 00:01:23.500
After all, there’s no substantial evidence.

30
00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.033
I’ve always suspected someone else.

31
00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.566
Yet you deliberately walked into the line of fire.

32
00:01:31.266 --> 00:01:33.333
Your Majesty, I have a new discovery.

33
00:01:33.333 --> 00:01:34.300
What discovery?

34
00:01:34.333 --> 00:01:35.600
Just now, our people reported

35
00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.366
that Consort De took two maidservants into the Cold Palace.

36
00:01:37.366 --> 00:01:39.200
When she came out, there was an extra person.

37
00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.700
A palace maid disguised as a maidservant was taken out of the Cold Palace by Consort De.

38
00:01:42.933 --> 00:01:43.766
A palace maid?

39
00:01:44.766 --> 00:01:46.200
Wasn’t she already mad?

40
00:01:46.333 --> 00:01:48.400
The guards said that for some reason,

41
00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.233
the palace maid was normal when she came out.

42
00:01:52.666 --> 00:01:54.100
To be able to

43
00:01:54.366 --> 00:01:56.933
restore a mad person to sanity so quickly

44
00:01:56.933 --> 00:01:58.900
is probably not as simple as poisoning.

45
00:01:59.066 --> 00:02:01.200
It must be some secret technique.

46
00:02:01.366 --> 00:02:04.100
If it weren’t for you, I would have killed you.

47
00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.900
When you let Gong Fei go,

48
00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:07.800
I knew it was for this purpose.

49
00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:09.766
How could I let her kill me?

50
00:02:12.366 --> 00:02:14.266
Don’t harm the Empress Dowager anymore.

51
00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:17.400
If Consort Rong is harmed in any way today,

52
00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.000
I will tear you apart!
