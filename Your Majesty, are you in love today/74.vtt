00:00:02.933 --> 00:00:04.733
Di Yuan, are you okay?

2
00:00:04.733 --> 00:00:05.733
I’m fine.

3
00:00:05.733 --> 00:00:07.466
They know I’m the Emperor’s person.

4
00:00:07.466 --> 00:00:08.466
They dare not harm me.

5
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:11.066
That’s good. Do you have a solution?

6
00:00:11.533 --> 00:00:13.366
If not, I’ll send people to arrest Chun Lan and torture her.

7
00:00:13.466 --> 00:00:15.733
If I can’t get anything out of her,

8
00:00:15.733 --> 00:00:17.200
it’s absolutely unacceptable.

9
00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:18.466
That’s not an option.

10
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.700
Even if Chun Lan tells the truth,

11
00:00:20.766 --> 00:00:22.100
the Empress Dowager might misunderstand.

12
00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:23.700
She might think it’s obtained under torture.

13
00:00:23.766 --> 00:00:26.300
Then I would be in deep trouble even if I jumped into the Yellow River.

14
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.566
What if we start with the young eunuch?

15
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:32.800
That’s not possible.

16
00:00:33.266 --> 00:00:34.566
There might not be such a person in the palace anymore.

17
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.700
Chun Lan’s words

18
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.000
are half true and half false.

19
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.600
The false part?

20
00:00:41.766 --> 00:00:43.200
It must be something others taught her to say.

21
00:00:43.566 --> 00:00:44.700
The true part?

22
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.500
She might have heard it firsthand.

23
00:00:47.966 --> 00:00:49.266
What do you mean half true?

24
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.100
I indeed had Bi Yuan

25
00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.366
bring some contraband from outside the palace.

26
00:00:55.366 --> 00:00:56.800
But it wasn’t really

27
00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.000
anything serious.

28
00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.500
Of course not.

29
00:00:59.766 --> 00:01:01.900
I just had a craving

30
00:01:01.966 --> 00:01:04.200
and asked Bi Yuan to bring back two strings of candied hawthorns.

31
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:05.300
I just wanted to eat some candied hawthorns.

32
00:01:08.166 --> 00:01:09.600
If you want anything in the future,

33
00:01:09.966 --> 00:01:11.233
just tell me.

34
00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:13.300
Okay.

35
00:01:15.566 --> 00:01:18.133
Bi Yuan, go get Chun Lan’s entry records

36
00:01:18.133 --> 00:01:20.766
from the palace archives.

37
00:01:22.966 --> 00:01:25.000
Do you think this matter was designed by the Empress Dowager?

38
00:01:25.066 --> 00:01:26.800
No.

39
00:01:27.933 --> 00:01:30.300
In my past life, the Empress Dowager strongly supported me as Empress.

40
00:01:30.466 --> 00:01:32.433
I know her character very well.

41
00:01:32.466 --> 00:01:34.433
She wouldn’t use such dirty tricks.

42
00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:36.266
Why are you so sure?

43
00:01:36.266 --> 00:01:37.766
Because I believe

44
00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.033
the Empress Dowager is not that kind of person.
