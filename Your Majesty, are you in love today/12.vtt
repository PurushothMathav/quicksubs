00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.600
Please, Your Majesty, help me.

2
00:00:04.766 --> 00:00:07.066
Ah, the familiar formula.

3
00:00:07.066 --> 00:00:08.200
The familiar taste.

4
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:10.966
Every time, Consort Yan plays the villain and then complains first.

5
00:00:10.966 --> 00:00:12.233
I’m always the one blamed.

6
00:00:12.333 --> 00:00:14.266
Looks like she’s about to make trouble again today.

7
00:00:14.666 --> 00:00:16.866
I came with good intentions to visit Consort Rong,

8
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.066
but she won’t even get out of bed.

9
00:00:20.333 --> 00:00:22.633
I am a consort personally appointed by the Emperor,

10
00:00:22.766 --> 00:00:24.200
and she dares to be so bold.

11
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:25.700
Consort Rong?

12
00:00:26.733 --> 00:00:27.966
Is that so?

13
00:00:28.266 --> 00:00:31.000
What’s the Emperor’s real intention here?

14
00:00:33.066 --> 00:00:34.033
Reply to the Emperor.

15
00:00:34.933 --> 00:00:38.633
I truly couldn’t get up due to illness,

16
00:00:38.766 --> 00:00:42.000
and indeed, I neglected Consort.

17
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.200
If Consort wants to punish me,

18
00:00:44.566 --> 00:00:46.166
then I’ll kneel.

19
00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:48.400
Why are you kneeling?

20
00:00:48.733 --> 00:00:50.566
I ordered the Consort to kneel.

21
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:53.300
Oh.

22
00:00:55.866 --> 00:00:59.100
Your Majesty, are you joking?

23
00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.100
I am the Son of Heaven,

24
00:01:01.366 --> 00:01:02.666
I never joke.

25
00:01:02.666 --> 00:01:04.100
Do you dare to question me?

26
00:01:05.866 --> 00:01:08.833
Why is it that when Consort Rong made a mistake,

27
00:01:08.866 --> 00:01:10.500
the Emperor punishes me instead?

28
00:01:10.866 --> 00:01:12.466
Consort Rong is unwell.

29
00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.200
It’s permitted by me.

30
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.166
Consort Rong doesn’t need to greet anyone.

31
00:01:17.466 --> 00:01:18.266
How?

32
00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.133
Does this Consort have more respect than me?

33
00:01:21.133 --> 00:01:22.300
I dare not.

34
00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:24.666
What’s going on?

35
00:01:25.133 --> 00:01:26.766
In my previous life, I never saw

36
00:01:26.766 --> 00:01:29.033
the Emperor willing to punish his beloved consort.

37
00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:33.900
Ah.

38
00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.600
Ah, you’re startled.

39
00:01:36.933 --> 00:01:38.433
Tonight, follow me to the Yangxin Hall.

40
00:01:39.266 --> 00:01:40.833
You’ll stay there in secret.

41
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:41.800
What?

42
00:01:42.333 --> 00:01:43.133
Yangxin Hall?

43
00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.266
Is the Emperor out of his mind?

44
00:01:45.366 --> 00:01:46.966
He kissed you and now wants me to attend to him?

45
00:01:47.366 --> 00:01:50.966
Your Majesty, this doesn’t seem right.

46
00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:53.100
It’s fine.

47
00:01:53.166 --> 00:01:56.000
There’s no need to be so particular about these minor details between us.

48
00:01:57.266 --> 00:01:58.066
Ah.

49
00:02:07.466 --> 00:02:09.500
In the flow of time.

50
00:02:11.966 --> 00:02:12.833
Good.

51
00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.666
Good, a person flies.
