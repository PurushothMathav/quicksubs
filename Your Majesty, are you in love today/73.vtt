00:00:00.466 --> 00:00:03.400
This person is Chun Lan, a maid from the Xingfu Palace.

2
00:00:03.466 --> 00:00:06.900
The old servant saw her acting suspiciously in the Imperial Garden that day.

3
00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:08.733
Her behavior was very suspicious.

4
00:00:08.733 --> 00:00:11.166
So I brought her back to the Cining Palace for questioning.

5
00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:15.433
Chun Lan, tell everything you saw that day in detail.

6
00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.600
That day, I unintentionally saw

7
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.700
the concubine's personal maid, Bi Yuan,

8
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:22.100
making a transaction with a young eunuch

9
00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:23.833
in the rockery of the Imperial Garden.

10
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.366
Bi Yuan

11
00:00:25.466 --> 00:00:28.366
took a human-shaped doll from that young eunuch.

12
00:00:28.933 --> 00:00:30.466
How dare you!

13
00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.766
Chun Lan, this is a serious crime of deceiving the emperor.

14
00:00:33.766 --> 00:00:35.000
Speak clearly!

15
00:00:35.366 --> 00:00:36.200
Shameless!

16
00:00:37.366 --> 00:00:39.233
Chun Lan, continue.

17
00:00:41.133 --> 00:00:44.000
At first, I didn’t pay much attention,

18
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.466
thinking it was just about some amulet or charm.

19
00:00:45.966 --> 00:00:47.600
She liked dolls.

20
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.033
But then, I noticed several times

21
00:00:51.933 --> 00:00:54.200
that after the Emperor left,

22
00:00:54.666 --> 00:00:56.900
the concubine would be alone with Bi Yuan in the palace,

23
00:00:56.966 --> 00:00:59.100
with all doors and windows tightly shut.

24
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.700
Moreover,

25
00:01:01.533 --> 00:01:02.433
I once heard

26
00:01:02.533 --> 00:01:05.900
from outside the palace that the concubine was talking with Bi Yuan about

27
00:01:05.966 --> 00:01:08.233
contraband in the palace.

28
00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.766
Did the Emperor hear that clearly?

29
00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:13.766
There are too many doubts about this matter.

30
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.700
I need to investigate thoroughly.

31
00:01:15.933 --> 00:01:17.300
We can’t conclude this matter hastily.

32
00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:18.766
Don’t jump to conclusions.

33
00:01:19.466 --> 00:01:20.500
It’s too early.

34
00:01:20.766 --> 00:01:24.466
The Dragon Concubine’s use of dark arts to harm the Empress Dowager is well-founded evidence.

35
00:01:24.466 --> 00:01:27.000
Do you still want to protect her in front of everyone?

36
00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:28.866
I am not protecting the concubine.

37
00:01:29.166 --> 00:01:31.800
It’s just that Chun Lan’s testimony is not yet verified.

38
00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:34.900
It’s too trivial to convict the concubine based on this.

39
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Hmph, there’s already a bloody lesson from the previous case.

40
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.233
The Emperor might wrongfully condemn the innocent again.

41
00:01:40.266 --> 00:01:42.633
The Emperor may again wrongly judge someone.

42
00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.233
Empress Dowager,

43
00:01:52.466 --> 00:01:53.466
I dare to ask

44
00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.866
for three days to investigate.

45
00:01:56.133 --> 00:01:57.233
In three days,

46
00:01:57.466 --> 00:01:59.400
I will clarify the situation.

47
00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:00.466
Otherwise,

48
00:02:00.566 --> 00:02:01.666
I will accept the consequences.
