00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:03.766
Empress Dowager, may you be well.

2
00:00:03.766 --> 00:00:05.033
Your Majesty, may you have blessings.

3
00:00:05.066 --> 00:00:06.966
Mother, Consort De has come to accompany you.

4
00:00:06.966 --> 00:00:08.200
Is there still official business to attend to?

5
00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:10.000
If not, I'll take my leave for now.

6
00:00:10.066 --> 00:00:11.833
Your Majesty should also take care of your health.

7
00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:13.966
Previously, due to Consort Rong,

8
00:00:13.966 --> 00:00:15.166
the Empress Dowager and the Emperor

9
00:00:15.166 --> 00:00:16.800
were already at odds, right?

10
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.400
Consort De is here again?

11
00:00:18.533 --> 00:00:20.300
This is all part of my duties.

12
00:00:20.866 --> 00:00:21.666
Hmm.

13
00:00:26.866 --> 00:00:29.166
Your Majesty, why have you come today?

14
00:00:29.166 --> 00:00:31.966
The Emperor has come to discuss the matter of establishing a consort.

15
00:00:31.966 --> 00:00:34.833
Now that the epidemic in the south has been controlled,

16
00:00:34.866 --> 00:00:36.933
the Emperor wishes to make Consort Rong the Empress after the epidemic ends.

17
00:00:36.933 --> 00:00:38.500
What do you think, Your Majesty?

18
00:00:38.666 --> 00:00:40.800
I am old now.

19
00:00:41.066 --> 00:00:42.566
If the Emperor truly loves Consort Rong,

20
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.000
then let him be.

21
00:00:45.133 --> 00:00:46.700
During this period,

22
00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:47.933
I have observed carefully.

23
00:00:47.933 --> 00:00:49.766
Consort Rong

24
00:00:49.766 --> 00:00:50.700
is indeed very different from the previous Consort Yan.

25
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.100
Consort De, I can have the Emperor grant you the title of Consort.

26
00:01:00.533 --> 00:01:04.000
But do not hope for the position of Empress.

27
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.666
I will follow Your Majesty’s arrangement.

28
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.400
Why has this old woman become so clear-headed today?

29
00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:16.800
If you continue to be so muddled after learning from me,

30
00:01:17.166 --> 00:01:19.500
don’t blame me for being rude.

31
00:01:19.533 --> 00:01:22.166
Hmph.

32
00:01:26.533 --> 00:01:28.666
Your Majesty, Nurse Jiang has arrived.

33
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.500
This old servant greets Your Majesty. Nurse, do not need to be formal.

34
00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:35.500
Please sit quickly.

35
00:01:39.766 --> 00:01:41.500
Mengmeng, I’m relieved you’re here.

36
00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:42.900
You are my reassurance.

37
00:01:43.166 --> 00:01:44.866
Rest assured, Your Majesty.

38
00:01:45.133 --> 00:01:48.166
This old servant will definitely do my best.

39
00:01:48.166 --> 00:01:50.633
I wish you success soon.

40
00:01:50.866 --> 00:01:53.600
This old servant has prepared the honey medicine.

41
00:01:53.933 --> 00:01:56.600
Just drop it into the tea,

42
00:01:56.733 --> 00:01:58.700
and let the Empress Dowager drink it.

43
00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.200
She will then be under your control.

44
00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:03.400
She will follow your every command.
