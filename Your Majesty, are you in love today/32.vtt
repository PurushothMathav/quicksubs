1
00:00:05.466 --> 00:00:09.066
We pay our respects to Your Majesty and the Empress Dowager.

2
00:00:09.333 --> 00:00:11.833
Everyone, please rise and thank His Majesty.

3
00:00:18.333 --> 00:00:22.233
I wish for everyone’s health and well-being.

4
00:00:22.333 --> 00:00:23.633
And may our Great Liang

5
00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:25.866
enjoy peace and prosperity.

6
00:00:27.333 --> 00:00:29.400
Your Majesty’s reputation

7
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.300
Everything seems different from the past.

8
00:00:34.666 --> 00:00:37.466
I wish the Empress Dowager boundless happiness and peace.

9
00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:39.166
This is coral from the South Sea

10
00:00:39.166 --> 00:00:41.066
that I personally brought back.

11
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.100
I hope the Empress Dowager likes it. Duke Duan has made a thoughtful gesture.

12
00:00:44.266 --> 00:00:46.166
This is Duke Duan George.

13
00:00:46.166 --> 00:00:48.066
He doesn’t seem like someone from the royal family at all.

14
00:00:48.133 --> 00:00:49.666
My younger brother,

15
00:00:49.733 --> 00:00:52.400
Father and Mother often taught me

16
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:53.866
to prioritize the people.

17
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.300
Now the Great Liang is peaceful and prosperous.

18
00:00:56.333 --> 00:00:58.600
If Father were here,

19
00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:00.033
he would surely praise Elder Brother.

20
00:01:00.566 --> 00:01:03.466
Everyone praises this literary talent, but it seems mindless.

21
00:01:03.866 --> 00:01:05.933
Who doesn’t know the late Emperor favored the treacherous and ruined his wife?

22
00:01:05.933 --> 00:01:07.866
He almost promoted him to a high position.

23
00:01:07.866 --> 00:01:10.633
Oh, my good brother,

24
00:01:10.866 --> 00:01:12.500
look at what you’re saying.

25
00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.266
Those who know might think you’re just speaking auspicious words.

26
00:01:15.266 --> 00:01:16.400
Those who don’t know

27
00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.666
might think Father has possessed you.

28
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.866
To specially praise your son’s superior.

29
00:01:24.566 --> 00:01:27.566
Elder Brother, you see, I absolutely did not mean that.

30
00:01:27.766 --> 00:01:29.766
Elder Brother, you see,

31
00:01:29.766 --> 00:01:31.566
I was just making a joke.

32
00:01:31.566 --> 00:01:32.466
Alright, Rui’er,

33
00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:33.466
stop talking nonsense.

34
00:01:33.466 --> 00:01:35.000
I’m not angry with you.

35
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:35.900
You may rise.

36
00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:39.300
Thank you, Your Majesty. Duke Duan is either hiding or too audacious to show respect.

37
00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:41.200
I actually lost to such a person in my past life.
