00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.233
The second round of animation begins

2
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.400
I didn't expect that the dog emperor would be so skilled

3
00:00:16.966 --> 00:00:18.100
That must have been an accident just now

4
00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:19.966
This time, it’s definitely a sure thing

5
00:00:29.266 --> 00:00:30.066
Hmm

6
00:00:30.933 --> 00:00:35.400
It seems that Su Xiunu painted the sea

7
00:00:35.666 --> 00:00:36.600
Look, everyone

8
00:00:36.966 --> 00:00:39.666
This larger one represents the rolling waves

9
00:00:39.666 --> 00:00:41.466
And the smaller one is

10
00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:42.900
A boat

11
00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.100
Even if Your Majesty could explain it before

12
00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.766
How would you explain all these messy dots that she painted?

13
00:00:48.766 --> 00:00:50.900
They’re all over the place

14
00:00:51.933 --> 00:00:53.233
What do you mean by "all over the place"?

15
00:00:53.933 --> 00:00:56.300
These are clearly seagulls

16
00:00:56.533 --> 00:00:57.600
Seagulls?

17
00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.100
As Su Xiunu’s younger sister

18
00:01:00.333 --> 00:01:02.033
You can't even understand her painting?

19
00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.133
But it makes sense

20
00:01:03.133 --> 00:01:05.766
Only someone who is truly skilled in painting and calligraphy

21
00:01:05.766 --> 00:01:07.800
Can see the subtle mysteries in this painting

22
00:01:08.666 --> 00:01:10.900
You're still far from that level

23
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.366
I didn’t expect Su Xiunu to have such a broad perspective

24
00:01:14.366 --> 00:01:15.966
When it comes to painting

25
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.100
I'm very pleased

26
00:01:17.366 --> 00:01:22.366
Someone, bring the plaque and confer the title of Zhaoyi to Su Xiunu

27
00:01:22.366 --> 00:01:24.166
She will reside in the Qihua Palace

28
00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.666
Zhaoyi? Confer her the title of Zhaoyi, what?

29
00:01:27.066 --> 00:01:28.866
Zhaoyi, what does that mean?

30
00:01:29.333 --> 00:01:30.500
The title of Zhaoyi is too low

31
00:01:30.566 --> 00:01:33.466
In that case, confer the title of Rongfei to Su Xiunu

32
00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.666
She will reside in the Changchun Palace

33
00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:39.166
What? How can the matter of conferring consorts be handled so casually?

34
00:01:39.166 --> 00:01:41.200
Moreover, the Changchun Palace is traditionally reserved for empresses

35
00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.166
How can it be an exception for a consort?

36
00:01:44.533 --> 00:01:47.600
Everything's in chaos! What on earth is he thinking?

37
00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:48.700
In my past life, when I first entered the palace

38
00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.333
I was just a lowly Cairen

39
00:01:50.333 --> 00:01:52.266
How is it that this life is so different?

40
00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.500
Could it be that the dog emperor has also been reborn?

41
00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.666
Look, Su Xiunu is so happy she’s about to faint

42
00:01:59.133 --> 00:02:00.066
This is just the beginning

43
00:02:00.066 --> 00:02:02.000
How could she faint just from being conferred as a consort?

44
00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.633
Where’s the imperial physician? Quick, call the imperial physician!

45
00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:05.933
Your Majesty, I have something to report

46
00:02:05.933 --> 00:02:07.333
Can’t you see your sister is fainting?

47
00:02:07.333 --> 00:02:08.266
Report it later

48
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.266
But, Your Majesty

49
00:02:10.733 --> 00:02:12.066
My sister's virtue is flawed

50
00:02:12.066 --> 00:02:13.066
She’s unworthy of being a consort
