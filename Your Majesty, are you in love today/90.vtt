00:00:01.566 --> 00:00:05.433
Consort Zhong, I was previously misled and made many mistakes.

2
00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:07.100
You don't blame me, do you?

3
00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:08.700
I’ve never blamed the Empress Dowager.

4
00:00:09.466 --> 00:00:11.766
In my eyes, you have always been someone who considers the greater good.

5
00:00:11.966 --> 00:00:14.766
You’ve always been someone who understands the bigger picture.

6
00:00:14.766 --> 00:00:15.733
Thanks to you and the Emperor this time.

7
00:00:15.733 --> 00:00:18.433
Mother, how do you feel?

8
00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:30.166
Mother, how are you feeling?

9
00:00:30.166 --> 00:00:32.700
Mother feels dizzy in her head.

10
00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.166
It’s nothing serious. Perhaps it's just because of your age.

11
00:00:36.166 --> 00:00:39.400
Mother, are you poisoned?

12
00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:42.800
Your Majesty, this old servant noticed your health declining.

13
00:00:42.933 --> 00:00:45.433
I asked Consort De to investigate secretly.

14
00:00:45.566 --> 00:00:47.100
As I suspected,

15
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.533
your condition was caused by Consort De’s prolonged poisoning.

16
00:00:50.533 --> 00:00:52.000
How could this happen?

17
00:00:53.133 --> 00:00:54.866
Consort De is such a monster!

18
00:00:55.466 --> 00:01:00.000
Your Majesty, think carefully. Has your condition been worsening since Consort De entered the palace?

19
00:01:00.133 --> 00:01:03.566
Consort De, how could she be like this?

20
00:01:03.566 --> 00:01:05.766
Don’t be angry.

21
00:01:05.766 --> 00:01:06.766
This might not be as simple as poisoning.

22
00:01:07.333 --> 00:01:09.000
I’ve sent people to work on the antidote overnight.

23
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.866
I can only temporarily alleviate your symptoms.

24
00:01:11.066 --> 00:01:12.566
We need to capture Consort De’s accomplices.

25
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.466
Only then will they reveal the antidote.

26
00:01:15.466 --> 00:01:16.800
Otherwise,

27
00:01:17.466 --> 00:01:18.300
I might die tragically at the hands of this wretch.

28
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.500
You are the Empress Dowager’s niece.

29
00:01:24.333 --> 00:01:25.900
Doesn’t the Empress Dowager treat you well?

30
00:01:26.366 --> 00:01:27.733
Why did you poison and frame the Empress Dowager?

31
00:01:27.733 --> 00:01:29.400
She treated me well.

32
00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.266
As a member of the Song family, she helped me become Empress.

33
00:01:31.933 --> 00:01:35.200
She ensured that I would never be dismissed.

34
00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.500
I wanted to show her my power.

35
00:01:37.766 --> 00:01:39.533
To let her see how formidable I am.

36
00:01:39.533 --> 00:01:41.200
How dare she!

37
00:01:41.933 --> 00:01:43.000
Hand over the antidote!
