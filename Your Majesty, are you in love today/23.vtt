00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:03.900
Consort Rong,

2
00:00:04.866 --> 00:00:06.900
What should we do now that Your Highness has rested?

3
00:00:06.966 --> 00:00:08.933
And this case has been handed over to the Ministry of Justice.

4
00:00:08.933 --> 00:00:09.900
That Minister Shen Wu,

5
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.100
Shen Wu is known to be from a family that values money.

6
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.266
Let me think.

7
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.300
You investigate Shen Wu.

8
00:00:19.166 --> 00:00:21.400
Everyone has weaknesses.

9
00:00:21.466 --> 00:00:25.500
I don’t believe Shen Wu is impervious.

10
00:00:27.166 --> 00:00:28.466
And you,

11
00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.366
You’ve been with me for so many years.

12
00:00:32.066 --> 00:00:34.666
If it turns out you’re behind this,

13
00:00:34.766 --> 00:00:36.433
You know what to do.

14
00:00:37.533 --> 00:00:38.666
I understand.

15
00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.833
How long has it been since His Majesty last visited me?

16
00:00:43.866 --> 00:00:45.033
Since the birthday celebration.

17
00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:47.433
He hasn’t set foot in Zhongcui Palace again.

18
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.500
After all,

19
00:00:52.266 --> 00:00:54.000
The emperor is powerful.

20
00:00:58.066 --> 00:01:00.366
Your Highness, the Deputy Minister of Justice has arrived.

21
00:01:07.266 --> 00:01:08.433
Consort Rong,

22
00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.433
He’s like the endless cries of monkeys on both banks,

23
00:01:13.566 --> 00:01:16.100
The small boat has passed through countless mountains.

24
00:01:16.333 --> 00:01:19.200
Qingyu, this is your brother Shen Wu.

25
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.433
In the future, Grandfather will teach you both together.

26
00:01:26.166 --> 00:01:27.766
You’ve met Brother Shen Wu.

27
00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.066
The green mountains on both banks face each other.

28
00:01:33.066 --> 00:01:33.600
The lone sail is far away.

29
00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.100
If they could marry when they grow up,

30
00:01:37.933 --> 00:01:40.100
It would be a beautiful thing.

31
00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:41.200
Grandpa, Grandpa,

32
00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.233
What did you just say?

33
00:01:43.566 --> 00:01:45.900
Haha, it’s nothing.

34
00:01:45.933 --> 00:01:47.866
Are you tired, daughter?

35
00:01:47.866 --> 00:01:49.100
If you are, rest for a while.

36
00:01:49.166 --> 00:01:51.400
Let Brother Shen Wu take you to play.

37
00:01:52.766 --> 00:01:55.100
I’ve sent someone to carefully investigate the area around Cuijin Lake.

38
00:01:55.533 --> 00:01:58.466
They found traces of blood on a golden vessel.

39
00:01:58.866 --> 00:02:00.700
It should be from the scene being staged by the culprit,

40
00:02:00.733 --> 00:02:02.433
Leaving behind a scratch by accident.

41
00:02:03.466 --> 00:02:06.366
Yiyuan, you take the records from the Imperial Kitchen to Minister Shen Wu and Teng Chao.

42
00:02:06.366 --> 00:02:08.033
This way,

43
00:02:08.266 --> 00:02:09.466
Minister Shen Wu will understand that the matter is not over.

44
00:02:09.866 --> 00:02:12.200
Thank you, Your Highness. I will take my leave.

45
00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.066
Thank you, Your Highness. I will take my leave.

46
00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:31.833
Really?

47
00:02:31.933 --> 00:02:32.866
It’s truly a blessing from heaven.

48
00:02:32.866 --> 00:02:36.600
I will also call Prince Su over.

49
00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.166
I want to give Consort Rong a great gift.
