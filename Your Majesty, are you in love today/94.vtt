1
00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:02.866
Soon, this prince will launch an attack to report back.

2
00:00:03.266 --> 00:00:04.600
This time, the southern expedition is a protest.

3
00:00:05.166 --> 00:00:05.966
You did well.

4
00:00:05.966 --> 00:00:07.766
That’s because of your strategy, my lord.

5
00:00:07.766 --> 00:00:08.900
A little trick.

6
00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:10.533
First, let a plague break out in the south.

7
00:00:10.533 --> 00:00:13.166
Then you immediately lead the southern expedition.

8
00:00:13.166 --> 00:00:14.600
Save the people from the fire and water.

9
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:17.800
Along the way, more and more people support you.

10
00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.700
This prince will surely be a good emperor.

11
00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:22.900
That’s natural.

12
00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:24.666
But for this protest,

13
00:00:24.733 --> 00:00:26.766
I’ve been exposed alongside you.

14
00:00:26.766 --> 00:00:29.100
Many people have already seen me.

15
00:00:29.266 --> 00:00:30.066
It doesn’t matter.

16
00:00:30.866 --> 00:00:33.300
Previously, the fake divine physician of Prince Duan was captured.

17
00:00:33.366 --> 00:00:35.000
Everyone thinks he is dead.

18
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.600
Besides, with this prince around,

19
00:00:37.766 --> 00:00:39.066
no one dares to act.

20
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:40.866
Deceive the prince’s favor.

21
00:00:45.533 --> 00:00:46.733
Greetings, Your Majesty.

22
00:00:46.733 --> 00:00:48.166
Your humble servant has come to report.

23
00:00:48.166 --> 00:00:49.733
Prince Rui has finally returned.

24
00:00:49.733 --> 00:00:52.300
His achievements in this protest are commendable.

25
00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:53.533
Your Majesty overpraises me.

26
00:00:53.533 --> 00:00:54.700
It is only right for me to die for the country.

27
00:00:54.866 --> 00:00:56.666
That’s my duty.

28
00:00:56.666 --> 00:00:59.866
Your Majesty, Prince Rui’s performance in this protest

29
00:00:59.866 --> 00:01:01.400
is truly admirable.

30
00:01:01.766 --> 00:01:04.900
Having such a talent is a blessing for our great Liang.

31
00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:06.966
A blessing for our great Liang.

32
00:01:07.566 --> 00:01:11.200
All the ministers agree that Prince Rui’s protest achievements

33
00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.600
will be heavily rewarded.

34
00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.400
Take Prince Rui away.

35
00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.900
Hey!

36
00:01:21.533 --> 00:01:23.500
Imperial Brother, what are you doing?

37
00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.433
Your humble servant is loyal.

38
00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:26.700
I’ve contributed to the protest!
