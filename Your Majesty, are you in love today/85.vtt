1
00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:01.566
Forget it.

2
00:00:23.466 --> 00:00:25.900
Your Majesty, thank you for coming south.

3
00:00:28.166 --> 00:00:29.033
Your Majesty.

4
00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.466
The Duke of End has indeed lived up to expectations.

5
00:00:37.533 --> 00:00:38.500
His efforts are commendable.

6
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:39.900
Truly, he is my good brother.

7
00:00:40.466 --> 00:00:41.700
Good news from the south.

8
00:00:41.866 --> 00:00:43.900
The plague in Liaocheng has been brought under control.

9
00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:45.900
It seems the Duke of End was well-prepared this time.

10
00:00:46.133 --> 00:00:47.000
On this trip,

11
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.266
he brought a renowned physician.

12
00:00:48.466 --> 00:00:50.066
The physician developed a miraculous medicine.

13
00:00:50.066 --> 00:00:52.100
Saving the common people from peril.

14
00:00:52.166 --> 00:00:52.966
Your Majesty.

15
00:00:53.133 --> 00:00:55.266
Although the Duke of End’s bringing this physician is indeed praiseworthy,

16
00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:56.433
I feel that

17
00:00:56.666 --> 00:00:58.766
the speed at which this epidemic was controlled

18
00:00:58.933 --> 00:01:01.000
seems as if someone was manipulating it.

19
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:02.666
You mean...

20
00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.466
All the colleagues in the Imperial Medical Department were helpless.

21
00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:07.433
Yet this physician brought by the Duke of End

22
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.633
managed to develop a miraculous medicine so quickly.

23
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.966
This seems too coincidental.

24
00:01:11.966 --> 00:01:13.633
You suspect that this plague

25
00:01:14.166 --> 00:01:16.033
was caused by this physician?

26
00:01:16.133 --> 00:01:17.566
I’m not sure at the moment.

27
00:01:17.933 --> 00:01:19.900
But the previous physician who faked his death and escaped,

28
00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.033
I have yet to find any clues.

29
00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:23.600
One can imagine,

30
00:01:23.733 --> 00:01:26.366
the person behind this physician has an extraordinary background.

31
00:01:26.366 --> 00:01:29.433
But the Duke of End is my brother, could it be...

32
00:01:32.766 --> 00:01:34.400
All of this is indeed too coincidental.

33
00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.466
Even if the Duke of End is my brother,

34
00:01:36.466 --> 00:01:38.666
if it endangers the court,

35
00:01:38.666 --> 00:01:39.866
causing harm to the people,

36
00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.100
a prince who breaks the law is punished the same as commoners.

37
00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:43.200
Indeed.

38
00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.133
I will order a thorough investigation into this matter.

39
00:01:46.133 --> 00:01:48.833
We must capture the treacherous traitors.

40
00:01:49.166 --> 00:01:50.833
I will obey.

41
00:01:51.866 --> 00:01:54.666
The Duke of End is deeply loved by the people of Liaocheng.
