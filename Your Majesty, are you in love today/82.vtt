00:00:00.466 --> 00:00:01.366
What are you doing here?

2
00:00:01.366 --> 00:00:02.900
Is Rui'er causing trouble again?

3
00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:05.600
Your Majesty, Chen Dingyuan is willing to go to the southern city.

4
00:00:05.766 --> 00:00:08.000
To share Your Majesty's concerns and help resolve the issue.

5
00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:09.266
Regarding the plague,

6
00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:10.766
how can you allow such nonsense?

7
00:00:10.766 --> 00:00:11.900
Chen Dingyuan is not being frivolous.

8
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.366
I care deeply about the safety of the people.

9
00:00:14.366 --> 00:00:16.100
Chen Dingyuan is willing to go south in person.

10
00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:17.300
To oversee the situation directly.

11
00:00:18.766 --> 00:00:21.933
Your Majesty, even if Chen Dingyuan goes south,

12
00:00:21.933 --> 00:00:23.866
only someone like Prince Rui

13
00:00:23.866 --> 00:00:25.200
can stabilize the people's hearts.

14
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.333
Perhaps no one is more suitable than Prince Rui.

15
00:00:28.333 --> 00:00:31.200
Your Majesty, Prince Rui's presence in the south

16
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.766
will also significantly aid in controlling the epidemic.

17
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:35.266
I hope Your Majesty will grant this.

18
00:00:35.566 --> 00:00:37.500
Since all the ministers agree,

19
00:00:37.766 --> 00:00:39.866
then let Prince Rui go to the affected area.

20
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:41.900
To turn the tide.

21
00:00:41.966 --> 00:00:43.666
I will certainly do my utmost.

22
00:00:43.666 --> 00:00:45.066
Not to disappoint Your Majesty's trust.

23
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:50.633
What is Your Majesty doing?

24
00:00:50.733 --> 00:00:52.100
With the plague breaking out in the south,

25
00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.466
Your Majesty has been working late into the night.

26
00:00:53.533 --> 00:00:56.066
The ministers have also stayed in the Yangxin Hall.

27
00:00:56.733 --> 00:00:57.700
The plague in the south.

28
00:00:57.866 --> 00:01:00.033
Hmm, it seems to have originated from the southern city.

29
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.666
In the previous life, it was the Duke of End who caused the outbreak.

30
00:01:02.733 --> 00:01:04.566
But didn’t the Duke of End die?

31
00:01:04.566 --> 00:01:05.700
How is the investigation I asked you to conduct?

32
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.000
Replying to Your Majesty,

33
00:01:08.066 --> 00:01:10.433
I haven’t found anything unusual.

34
00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:11.600
The Concubine De only goes to Ci Ning Palace

35
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.700
to pay respects to the Empress Dowager.

36
00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.600
At other times, she stays in Yao Hua Palace,

37
00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:18.100
playing cards and drinking tea with other consorts.

38
00:01:18.333 --> 00:01:20.566
And she enjoys going to the Imperial Garden to pick flowers.

39
00:01:20.566 --> 00:01:22.866
Picking flowers, hmm?

40
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.400
What kind of flowers?

41
00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.066
Balsam flowers. And what about the one in the Cold Palace?

42
00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:28.600
The one in the Cold Palace?

43
00:01:28.766 --> 00:01:31.566
Often in tatters,

44
00:01:31.733 --> 00:01:33.000
with a confused mind.

45
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.466
Still half-mad and half-silly.

46
00:01:34.466 --> 00:01:35.300
Half-mad?

47
00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:36.833
Half-silly, hmm?
