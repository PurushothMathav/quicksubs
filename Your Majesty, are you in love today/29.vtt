00:00:01.366 --> 00:00:02.166
Speak.

2
00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:05.066
Why haven’t you finished the clothing for the concubines?

3
00:00:05.533 --> 00:00:07.933
Your Majesty, there aren’t enough people.

4
00:00:07.933 --> 00:00:09.133
What nonsense.

5
00:00:09.133 --> 00:00:11.100
You had 100 seamstresses last time.

6
00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:12.766
Only eight pieces of clothing,

7
00:00:12.766 --> 00:00:14.233
and you say there aren’t enough people?

8
00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:16.400
I don’t care what method you use.

9
00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.100
You must finish it and deliver it to the palace within ten days.

10
00:00:19.266 --> 00:00:21.400
Otherwise, you can forget about your position as the head of the Bureau of Internal Affairs.

11
00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:22.333
You can quit.

12
00:00:22.333 --> 00:00:25.666
Sister Rong, you really have quite a lot of influence.

13
00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:27.700
I’ve seen the palace consorts before.

14
00:00:29.533 --> 00:00:31.266
Sister, please get up quickly.

15
00:00:31.266 --> 00:00:33.866
I can’t afford to receive this.

16
00:00:34.366 --> 00:00:35.566
Palace consort,

17
00:00:35.966 --> 00:00:38.000
Something so significant happened recently.

18
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.933
Why aren’t you staying in the Zhongcui Palace?

19
00:00:39.933 --> 00:00:41.900
What brings you here?

20
00:00:42.566 --> 00:00:46.100
I came to naturally discuss the Empress Dowager’s birthday banquet.

21
00:00:47.366 --> 00:00:48.800
Regarding the Empress Dowager’s birthday banquet,

22
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.466
the Emperor has entrusted me with full responsibility.

23
00:00:52.333 --> 00:00:53.800
I know.

24
00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.166
If you have something to say,

25
00:00:56.366 --> 00:00:57.533
just say it.

26
00:00:57.533 --> 00:00:58.866
For the Empress Dowager’s birthday banquet,

27
00:00:58.866 --> 00:00:59.200
I

28
00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:02.666
need to make a Phoenix gown with white birds for the Empress Dowager.

29
00:01:02.666 --> 00:01:06.200
This gown requires gold threads to be woven one by one.

30
00:01:06.333 --> 00:01:08.400
I cannot complete it myself.

31
00:01:08.566 --> 00:01:11.800
I need the seamstresses from last time to help me.

32
00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.133
So, the people

33
00:01:13.133 --> 00:01:14.466
have been reassigned.

34
00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.866
This was also promised to me by the Emperor.

35
00:01:18.566 --> 00:01:20.166
Half of them, yes.

36
00:01:20.333 --> 00:01:22.300
I’m just here to inform you.

37
00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.566
The Empress Dowager really likes the Landscape of the Great Nation.

38
00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.233
It’s in English.

39
00:01:28.266 --> 00:01:30.866
Please turn this into embroidery to give to the Empress Dowager.

40
00:01:31.133 --> 00:01:33.566
Ah, sister also wants to help you.

41
00:01:33.566 --> 00:01:36.300
But that Phoenix gown

42
00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:38.800
has already made me quite anxious.

43
00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:40.566
As for the Landscape of the Great Nation,

44
00:01:40.566 --> 00:01:42.500
you’ll have to handle it yourself.

45
00:01:43.266 --> 00:01:47.566
Please don’t disappoint the Empress Dowager.

46
00:01:49.366 --> 00:01:50.700
In the past life, the Empress Dowager’s birthday banquet

47
00:01:50.766 --> 00:01:52.600
had these two as the main attractions.

48
00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:53.866
It’s up to next year.

49
00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:56.566
If I can’t prepare them,

50
00:01:57.866 --> 00:02:00.400
I’ll really have a hard life for two lifetimes.

51
00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.600
The dog emperor has set such a big trap for me.

52
00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:05.066
Don’t expect to be better off.

53
00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:09.166
I’m tired and will not keep the palace consort here to talk.

54
00:02:10.366 --> 00:02:11.366
Please leave.

55
00:02:12.333 --> 00:02:13.133
Hmph.

56
00:02:18.733 --> 00:02:19.766
Please calm down, Your Majesty.

57
00:02:19.766 --> 00:02:22.000
If the maidservants fail to deliver the embroidery for the Landscape of the Great Nation and the concubines’ clothing,

58
00:02:22.266 --> 00:02:24.666
and if the Emperor and Empress Dowager lose face,

59
00:02:24.666 --> 00:02:25.666
it will be their fault.

60
00:02:26.166 --> 00:02:28.133
They will suffer.

61
00:02:28.133 --> 00:02:29.433
In the palace,

62
00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:31.433
they’re nothing.
