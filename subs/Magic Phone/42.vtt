00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.533
Who is your woman?

2
00:00:01.533 --> 00:00:03.700
Zhao Bin, I am a simp

3
00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:05.100
As soon as you lick me, I'll be with you

4
00:00:05.133 --> 00:00:06.433
It's his brain

5
00:00:06.733 --> 00:00:08.766
Sister, I'm all for your own good.

6
00:00:08.766 --> 00:00:10.333
He wants a house, no house, no car, no car

7
00:00:10.333 --> 00:00:11.333
He's a piece of crap.

8
00:00:11.333 --> 00:00:14.366
Ruin me, it's you who should carry me

9
00:00:14.366 --> 00:00:17.733
Don't you know what kind of person Lin Zhiyu is?

10
00:00:17.733 --> 00:00:21.433
No matter how ordinary he is, he is not something you can compare to

11
00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.133
Wu Xue, let's go

12
00:00:23.133 --> 00:00:25.600
Li Siyu, are you shameless?

13
00:00:25.733 --> 00:00:27.566
What am I doing?

14
00:00:27.566 --> 00:00:30.366
You are not him when did he become you

15
00:00:30.666 --> 00:00:32.466
Du Xue follow me

16
00:00:32.466 --> 00:00:35.866
I bought a guitar and went to find him in my underwear

17
00:00:38.066 --> 00:00:40.900
Lu Xuan, what's so good about underwear in the new district?

18
00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:43.166
Do you want to see when

19
00:00:43.966 --> 00:00:46.400
Who wants to see you wearing those dogs?

20
00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.400
Brother Lu Xuan, let's go, Brother Lu Xuan

21
00:00:49.533 --> 00:00:51.633
Let's go, brother Lu Xuan

22
00:00:52.333 --> 00:00:54.066
Let's go, brother Lu Xuan

23
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.866
Let's go, Brother Lu Xuan, let's go, Brother Lu Xuan

24
00:00:58.066 --> 00:00:59.566
Hey don't do that

25
00:00:59.666 --> 00:01:02.800
I was turned in half, and the video is behind.

26
00:01:03.466 --> 00:01:05.833
It's my fault, where can I steal it? I'll rub it for you.

27
00:01:05.933 --> 00:01:07.900
I'm talking to you

28
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.266
That old man is air

29
00:01:10.766 --> 00:01:11.966
Isn't that amazing?

30
00:01:12.533 --> 00:01:13.500
Just right. Just right.

31
00:01:14.066 --> 00:01:15.266
It's all my fault

32
00:01:15.266 --> 00:01:17.500
Doctor, just hit me

33
00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.700
You didn't hear what I said

34
00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:21.666
My father is the head of Hong Kong history books

35
00:01:21.666 --> 00:01:22.466
Believe it or not

36
00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.033
I made him disappear from this world with a single phone call

37
00:01:27.733 --> 00:01:28.900
You try it.
