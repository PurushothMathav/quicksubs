00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:01.733
Get out of the way

2
00:00:01.733 --> 00:00:02.766
I would like to marry you.

3
00:00:02.766 --> 00:00:04.066
No car, no house

4
00:00:04.066 --> 00:00:05.166
I can get the certificate now.

5
00:00:05.166 --> 00:00:07.500
Xiaoxuan, look at my daughter's statement

6
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:08.466
Promise soon

7
00:00:08.466 --> 00:00:10.166
What if you miss this opportunity today?

8
00:00:10.166 --> 00:00:13.300
I'm afraid I won't have the chance to find a good woman in the future

9
00:00:13.333 --> 00:00:13.766
Do the same

10
00:00:13.766 --> 00:00:16.633
There is no woman in this world except your daughter

11
00:00:19.966 --> 00:00:22.600
As long as they are willing to marry me, I am willing to marry

12
00:00:22.733 --> 00:00:24.300
Let's go.

13
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.800
Mo Xuan, you can't leave

14
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.100
We're out of money.

15
00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:28.233
What does it have to do with me?

16
00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.100
Hey miss you can't go

17
00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:35.166
Don't mind if I did that just now.

18
00:00:35.166 --> 00:00:36.766
If anyone wants to marry me

19
00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.000
I would like to marry

20
00:00:39.066 --> 00:00:40.966
I understand you have a boyfriend.

21
00:00:40.966 --> 00:00:42.766
Uh, you and Dean Zhu still have something to talk about

22
00:00:42.766 --> 00:00:44.033
Don't make him wait

23
00:00:44.133 --> 00:00:45.066
I happen to have something to do too

24
00:00:45.066 --> 00:00:46.266
I'll go first

25
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:47.600
Wuxuan

26
00:00:49.266 --> 00:00:50.766
We lied to you.

27
00:00:50.766 --> 00:00:51.966
I don't have a boyfriend.

28
00:00:52.133 --> 00:00:54.866
Do we really want to eat this? Can we return it?

29
00:00:54.866 --> 00:00:56.466
Don't talk so much nonsense to me

30
00:00:56.466 --> 00:00:57.333
Buy now

31
00:00:57.333 --> 00:00:58.566
Don't want to leave without paying the bill

32
00:01:00.566 --> 00:01:03.100
Lu Xuan, I was wrong.

33
00:01:03.166 --> 00:01:05.600
Just, can you help me pay for this?

34
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:06.966
If you don't help me

35
00:01:06.966 --> 00:01:08.700
My mom and I are going to work here for a year

36
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:09.400
To be credited

37
00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:10.200
Didn't you say

38
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.400
Are all the men who pay you in line?

39
00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:13.500
Go find them!

40
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:14.733
I was poor.

41
00:01:14.733 --> 00:01:15.833
Can't help you.

42
00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.600
Waiter, your foreman is in a hurry

43
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.133
Pull it away and give it to me

44
00:01:20.133 --> 00:01:20.933
Do not eat

45
00:01:21.866 --> 00:01:23.800
I really didn't eat a bite.

46
00:01:24.966 --> 00:01:26.500
Then pull the wool

47
00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.000
Using the system to build a career is the right thing to do

48
00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:34.500
Falling Snow
