00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:01.100
You all kneel down for me

2
00:00:01.166 --> 00:00:01.966
Do you hear me?

3
00:00:01.966 --> 00:00:03.366
Didn't you hear what Xiaoyao said?

4
00:00:03.366 --> 00:00:05.766
Kneel down and say you two idiots

5
00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:07.500
Master Xiao, what do you mean?

6
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:08.466
Don't let them kneel?

7
00:00:08.466 --> 00:00:10.466
Oops, I kneel down

8
00:00:10.733 --> 00:00:11.666
Did you know

9
00:00:12.066 --> 00:00:13.300
Who are you offending?

10
00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:15.166
This is the Blue Phoenix of Xuantian Temple

11
00:00:15.466 --> 00:00:18.233
Yunyun Prefecture is full of peak blue phoenixes

12
00:00:19.133 --> 00:00:20.600
Mr. Lan, I'm sorry

13
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:22.666
I didn't know it was you

14
00:00:23.066 --> 00:00:24.900
Good blue lord

15
00:00:25.166 --> 00:00:27.233
I was wrong, Lan Zhan Lan Feng.

16
00:00:29.066 --> 00:00:29.966
Why are you sorry?

17
00:00:29.966 --> 00:00:31.966
Sir, I'm sorry

18
00:00:31.966 --> 00:00:33.333
I have no eyes

19
00:00:33.333 --> 00:00:34.100
I have no eyes

20
00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.766
I have eyeballs.

21
00:00:34.766 --> 00:00:37.866
The stinky man forgives me and admits his mistake

22
00:00:38.266 --> 00:00:39.466
bully

23
00:00:39.466 --> 00:00:40.800
Dogs look down on people

24
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.300
If I'm not here today

25
00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.000
How do you want to bully people

26
00:00:44.733 --> 00:00:46.833
How does the division of labor want to deal with it?

27
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.766
I just got famous, it's just a lift of the hand

28
00:00:48.766 --> 00:00:49.966
Migrant workers here are also

29
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.466
How can I help them here?

30
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.166
You are the parents of migrant workers

31
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:53.966
It's all dubbing.

32
00:00:53.966 --> 00:00:55.300
Even if I am the parent official

33
00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.200
I still need to hear your opinion on this matter.

34
00:00:57.266 --> 00:00:58.100
Again

35
00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.666
You don't need to say more about buying the Bluetooth of Changhe Hospital.

36
00:01:00.666 --> 00:01:02.300
I believe you can handle it fairly.

37
00:01:02.733 --> 00:01:04.566
Well, in that case

38
00:01:04.566 --> 00:01:06.000
Then Mr. Ilu

39
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.933
You humiliated Mr. Lu before, but you said it

40
00:01:08.933 --> 00:01:11.166
If Mr. Lu can afford the bag in the store

41
00:01:11.166 --> 00:01:13.900
Just kneel down and call his father
