00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.133
Daughter picks the expensive one.

2
00:00:02.133 --> 00:00:05.900
When he comes, he can't listen to you talking about me.

3
00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:07.666
I've kissed seventy or eighty times

4
00:00:07.666 --> 00:00:10.733
I know better than you how to deal with these stinky men

5
00:00:10.733 --> 00:00:12.866
I want all the dishes above

6
00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:16.400
And 10,000 dollars a bottle of wine in your store

7
00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:17.900
Give me ten more bottles

8
00:00:17.933 --> 00:00:20.466
Miss, how many people are we?

9
00:00:20.466 --> 00:00:21.400
These 30 + dishes

10
00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.533
With these wines, there are more than 100,000

11
00:00:23.533 --> 00:00:24.800
Besides, you can't finish it.

12
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.700
Just you dirty thing, I can't finish eating and packing.

13
00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:28.600
Wordy

14
00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:31.600
Believe it or not, I'll ask your store manager to get you out of here

15
00:00:33.066 --> 00:00:35.400
If you can't finish drinking, you can sell it.

16
00:00:35.533 --> 00:00:38.466
You'll make 100,000 at once

17
00:00:40.266 --> 00:00:41.100
Lu Xuan

18
00:00:43.133 --> 00:00:44.200
Hey, hello.

19
00:00:45.166 --> 00:00:45.966
Excuse me.

20
00:00:49.166 --> 00:00:49.966
Dear

21
00:00:50.366 --> 00:00:52.200
Since you are here for a blind date

22
00:00:52.266 --> 00:00:54.433
Then Auntie got straight to the point

23
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:55.666
What to say

24
00:00:55.666 --> 00:00:58.100
I didn't say you have a car or a house

25
00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:59.466
Not yet.

26
00:00:59.466 --> 00:01:04.100
No car, no house, so naturally there is no deposit

27
00:01:04.266 --> 00:01:07.066
It's just a poor ghost learning from others, what kind of kiss?

28
00:01:07.066 --> 00:01:09.066
Buy the order and go away

29
00:01:09.066 --> 00:01:10.966
The two co-authors asked me to pay for it

30
00:01:10.966 --> 00:01:12.466
I haven't eaten a bite of this dish

31
00:01:12.466 --> 00:01:14.066
It's your business if you don't eat

32
00:01:14.066 --> 00:01:17.400
What do you mean, I'm on a blind date with you?

33
00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.700
He wants my hit registered

34
00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:20.266
This is the first time we have met.

35
00:01:20.266 --> 00:01:22.066
And you're not my girlfriend

36
00:01:23.166 --> 00:01:24.866
Just like you

37
00:01:24.866 --> 00:01:26.833
I can't find a girlfriend in my life

38
00:01:26.933 --> 00:01:28.366
The old lady put the words here

39
00:01:28.366 --> 00:01:30.300
Why don't you buy this order today?

40
00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:31.466
I'm not done with you

41
00:01:32.533 --> 00:01:35.366
He is not stupid for the main order today.
