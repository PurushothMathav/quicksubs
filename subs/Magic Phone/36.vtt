00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:02.600
Who said I want to go back on my word?

2
00:00:02.766 --> 00:00:05.166
The money in my hands can't be turned around for the time being

3
00:00:05.333 --> 00:00:06.233
Wait a minute.

4
00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:11.233
Help me think of a way

5
00:00:11.333 --> 00:00:15.266
I can't help you figure it out for yourself, that's right

6
00:00:15.266 --> 00:00:17.466
You have to go back on this

7
00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.000
My grandfather can't keep it

8
00:00:20.466 --> 00:00:22.900
Does the emperor want my help?

9
00:00:23.366 --> 00:00:25.666
So I don't need you to bark like a dog

10
00:00:25.666 --> 00:00:27.300
Kneel down and tell everyone wrong

11
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.000
Are you trying to trick me tonight?

12
00:00:29.166 --> 00:00:31.966
Miss Sun really didn't seem to be talking nonsense just now.

13
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:32.900
Yes

14
00:00:33.466 --> 00:00:35.700
Who wants to say that it seems that the emperor is not hiding my account?

15
00:00:36.466 --> 00:00:39.300
The eldest sister originally called and asked him first

16
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.566
How should this be handled?

17
00:00:40.766 --> 00:00:41.600
Yes

18
00:00:42.333 --> 00:00:43.300
Hey, hey, hey.

19
00:00:44.266 --> 00:00:45.066
Walk slowly

20
00:00:48.566 --> 00:00:51.000
I am not my luxurious patience with you

21
00:00:51.333 --> 00:00:54.700
Thinking about tricking you is really this garbage going to trump you on the road

22
00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:56.566
You don't have to help this garbage

23
00:00:56.566 --> 00:00:58.000
Let Ranger teach him a lesson

24
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.633
Lu Shao doesn't show off, we carry you

25
00:01:00.866 --> 00:01:02.566
That's right, Brother Xuan

26
00:01:02.566 --> 00:01:05.066
I should let the blue patrol give him a good lesson

27
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.566
Brother Xuan, just listen to everyone

28
00:01:07.566 --> 00:01:09.633
Don't help this kind of person
