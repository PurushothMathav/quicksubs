00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.200
Hahaha, wrap it all up.

2
00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:04.566
Poor man, do you know all the bags in this store?

3
00:00:04.566 --> 00:00:05.866
How much will it cost to buy it?

4
00:00:05.866 --> 00:00:06.700
I'll tell you what.

5
00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:09.166
If I sell you, you can't afford garbage like this.

6
00:00:09.166 --> 00:00:10.133
simp

7
00:00:10.133 --> 00:00:13.066
Why didn't I find you so bragging before?

8
00:00:13.666 --> 00:00:14.466
today

9
00:00:14.466 --> 00:00:18.766
If you can really buy all the bags in this store

10
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:24.033
I'll kneel down with Brother Fei and call you

11
00:00:24.666 --> 00:00:25.800
OK

12
00:00:35.866 --> 00:00:37.300
Received 5 million

13
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.633
Congratulations to the host for getting the rebate 500,000

14
00:00:41.666 --> 00:00:44.266
The current limit of personal account is two 1 million

15
00:00:45.766 --> 00:00:48.466
All the goods in your store add up to less than 300.

16
00:00:48.466 --> 00:00:50.266
All the extra money is tips.

17
00:00:50.266 --> 00:00:52.966
Mr. Homework, Mr. Homework, I'll go pack it now

18
00:00:53.466 --> 00:00:54.366
You go with him

19
00:00:54.366 --> 00:00:55.666
Ask him to take the bag home.

20
00:00:55.666 --> 00:00:57.400
We can't take it back ourselves

21
00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.066
Ok right

22
00:00:59.066 --> 00:01:03.000
Don't forget to call Lu Xuan father you

23
00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.333
My wife knelt down and asked me to listen to my father

24
00:01:07.333 --> 00:01:08.666
What are you?

25
00:01:08.666 --> 00:01:10.033
I am the royal master

26
00:01:10.133 --> 00:01:12.366
It's also trash like you that can kill you

27
00:01:12.566 --> 00:01:14.200
What's the matter, Miss Cleaner?

28
00:01:14.466 --> 00:01:16.500
Look at how I call an ambulance now
