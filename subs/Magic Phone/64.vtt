00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:01.866
Here we go. What's going on?

2
00:00:01.866 --> 00:00:04.500
Jiang Hai still started with the people around Lu Xuan

3
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:05.600
Contact my father

4
00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:07.266
I want Lu Xuan to be the soldier leader

5
00:00:07.333 --> 00:00:10.000
If he doesn't agree, tell him.

6
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.600
Lu Xuan has obtained the inheritance of the Dragon Emperor Supreme Palace

7
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.100
He is a soldier and has been defeated

8
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:15.833
He made it happen.

9
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.066
He can't do it.

10
00:00:17.766 --> 00:00:19.900
Go, that's my father

11
00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:21.466
Who is the host and guest, not the seat

12
00:00:21.466 --> 00:00:23.866
I recommended Lu Xuan to him as the guest host

13
00:00:24.333 --> 00:00:26.800
Come to think of it, Jiang Hai doesn't know yet

14
00:00:26.933 --> 00:00:29.666
The guest-host position of DingTalk on the board has overflowed

15
00:00:29.666 --> 00:00:31.066
Are you the one?

16
00:00:31.066 --> 00:00:32.433
Then you are

17
00:00:33.133 --> 00:00:33.600
Lan Lan

18
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.866
You lied to me so hard, my status is special

19
00:00:35.866 --> 00:00:37.500
Born in the wrong season

20
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.733
The whole summer except for my father and Xiaohua

21
00:00:39.733 --> 00:00:41.166
Just a few of you know

22
00:00:41.533 --> 00:00:44.833
It's useless to keep scum like Du Xuan

23
00:00:44.933 --> 00:00:47.033
Kill no no

24
00:00:47.133 --> 00:00:48.033
Don't kill me

25
00:00:48.166 --> 00:00:50.100
I fuck you spare me I don't want to die

26
00:00:50.133 --> 00:00:51.100
Move my mother

27
00:00:51.366 --> 00:00:52.800
And let me spare you

28
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:54.100
venting

29
00:00:54.666 --> 00:00:56.433
Oh, fuck me.

30
00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.133
Come on, Sister Sun, thank you.

31
00:01:04.133 --> 00:01:05.766
I don't accept verbal thanks

32
00:01:05.766 --> 00:01:07.600
If you really want to thank me, just come with me

33
00:01:15.966 --> 00:01:17.433
What are you doing standing so far away?

34
00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.633
I'm afraid I'll eat it, come here

35
00:01:26.166 --> 00:01:27.533
Didn't you say you wanted to thank me?

36
00:01:27.533 --> 00:01:29.466
That's not how you introduce people to you

37
00:01:30.733 --> 00:01:31.666
Ah well.
