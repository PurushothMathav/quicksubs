00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:08.866
Miss Jiang

2
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.500
Your father has made a deal with Li Le

3
00:00:11.733 --> 00:00:15.500
With 200 million 4.11 million a dime to marry you management

4
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.233
Your father and Li Le are preparing for their wedding

5
00:00:18.266 --> 00:00:20.633
I'm here to pick you up to get married

6
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:22.966
That's what my father promised

7
00:00:22.966 --> 00:00:24.300
What does it have to do with me?

8
00:00:24.666 --> 00:00:27.500
I have the final say in who I want to marry

9
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:28.866
You're right.

10
00:00:29.166 --> 00:00:31.566
But your father asked me to give you a message

11
00:00:31.766 --> 00:00:32.900
As long as you can find

12
00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.200
A dime more than Li Le's dowry

13
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.000
You can make your own decisions about your marriage

14
00:00:37.766 --> 00:00:40.966
Can you afford the rich second generation big shot?

15
00:00:40.966 --> 00:00:41.566
Ah!

16
00:00:41.566 --> 00:00:45.366
As far as I know, your account 200 million 4.11 million

17
00:00:45.866 --> 00:00:48.033
Isn't it just a little more than their bride price?

18
00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:49.766
Lu Xuan, I'll lend you

19
00:00:49.933 --> 00:00:51.400
Although I worship money

20
00:00:51.533 --> 00:00:53.433
But I can't see how you say we are now

21
00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.266
Be sure to punch them in the face today

22
00:00:57.933 --> 00:00:58.733
Huh?

23
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.366
Why can't I turn around?

24
00:01:00.366 --> 00:01:02.300
Come on, magic, give it a spiral.

25
00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:05.366
Don't be in vain

26
00:01:05.466 --> 00:01:08.433
No one can transfer the account to him today.

27
00:01:08.466 --> 00:01:10.500
Let's get it in before we come

28
00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:11.533
It has something to do with him

29
00:01:11.533 --> 00:01:14.166
Everyone's bank cards are frozen

30
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.300
We are well prepared

31
00:01:16.733 --> 00:01:17.533
But

32
00:01:17.733 --> 00:01:19.800
Do you think this will force my girlfriend

33
00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.933
Are you married?

34
00:01:21.933 --> 00:01:23.200
But he had no choice.

35
00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:24.500
If he doesn't get married

36
00:01:24.666 --> 00:01:27.566
His father can make his mother bear 10 times the burden

37
00:01:27.933 --> 00:01:28.333
At that time

38
00:01:28.333 --> 00:01:31.400
They will be families and at risk of collapse

39
00:01:31.933 --> 00:01:33.033
So let's just say that.

40
00:01:33.133 --> 00:01:35.733
He has to abandon you and marry Li today

41
00:01:35.733 --> 00:01:37.166
This path can be chosen

42
00:01:37.166 --> 00:01:39.333
Hahaha how about it?

43
00:01:39.333 --> 00:01:41.100
How is my revenge?

44
00:01:42.133 --> 00:01:44.866
Just think you've eaten me all

45
00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:49.266
I really can't think of any way you can do it.

46
00:01:49.733 --> 00:01:53.466
Can keep him by your side

47
00:01:53.733 --> 00:01:56.400
So you let us see

48
00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.266
How do you keep your woman?

49
00:01:59.533 --> 00:02:01.666
I can't give a higher bride price than Lao Tzu

50
00:02:01.933 --> 00:02:06.433
Just watch me marry your woman honestly
