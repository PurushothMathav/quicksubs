1
00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:01.433
Take us down

2
00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:03.466
I'm afraid you're going to be disappointed today

3
00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:04.666
The auspicious time has come

4
00:00:04.666 --> 00:00:06.466
Rhododendron, we're on stage.

5
00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:17.066
I'll just sit here and see who dares to touch me

6
00:00:17.066 --> 00:00:18.466
What a big breath

7
00:00:18.466 --> 00:00:19.900
You get off me

8
00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.966
This position is the throne of the guest and the host

9
00:00:23.066 --> 00:00:25.500
It symbolizes the supreme separation of powers in the lower kingdom

10
00:00:25.666 --> 00:00:28.200
Non-guest seated person dies

11
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.566
How do you know I'm not a soldier?

12
00:00:30.966 --> 00:00:34.633
If you were the soldier leader, I would be the left hand

13
00:00:34.866 --> 00:00:36.266
What nonsense do you talk to him?

14
00:00:36.366 --> 00:00:38.566
This soldier is under the will of the four warlords

15
00:00:38.566 --> 00:00:40.666
It has become a fact that you are the leader of the army

16
00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:42.766
Since they are hell-bent on death

17
00:00:42.766 --> 00:00:43.766
Then I will fulfill them

18
00:00:43.766 --> 00:00:45.700
Come on, I'll kill him

19
00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:48.366
Kill us

20
00:00:51.533 --> 00:00:53.566
Jianghai look at this

21
00:00:53.933 --> 00:00:55.300
Enter the publicity and listen to the wind

22
00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:57.833
Choose a ring

23
00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:01.700
What is Heaven and War?

24
00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:03.566
Allure City

25
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.366
Turn Honghu Xue Zhizhi slightly

26
00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:07.966
Keiji

27
00:01:08.466 --> 00:01:11.533
Left-handed Lan Xiongtian canonized Rhododendron as the lord of the town

28
00:01:11.533 --> 00:01:12.366
soldier

29
00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.000
How is this possible?

30
00:01:15.066 --> 00:01:16.466
How could it be the soldier?

31
00:01:16.466 --> 00:01:17.900
How could this be?

32
00:01:18.166 --> 00:01:20.333
It's not true. He's a soldier

33
00:01:20.333 --> 00:01:21.366
It's not true.

34
00:01:21.366 --> 00:01:22.466
That's not true.

35
00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.200
How could this be?
