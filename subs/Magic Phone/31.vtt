00:00:00.766 --> 00:00:02.333
Who are you? What does it have to do with you?

2
00:00:02.333 --> 00:00:03.966
You two affect my appetite

3
00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:06.433
Muse, let's go

4
00:00:06.466 --> 00:00:07.366
Can't go

5
00:00:07.366 --> 00:00:09.200
I asked you to buy a meal to give you a cushion.

6
00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.966
Do you know

7
00:00:09.966 --> 00:00:12.266
The man who wants to buy food for my mother is expensive

8
00:00:12.266 --> 00:00:14.533
And they all drive luxury cars

9
00:00:14.533 --> 00:00:16.066
Hard work today

10
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.766
Otherwise, I want to go on a blind date with my sister-in-law

11
00:00:18.866 --> 00:00:20.400
I haven't given you a chance yet

12
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:21.900
Do you need it?

13
00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.966
I don't see what I look like

14
00:00:23.966 --> 00:00:26.266
Lie to eat and drink, really treat yourself as a character

15
00:00:26.266 --> 00:00:28.200
Please correct your position

16
00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:29.833
Here we go.

17
00:00:30.766 --> 00:00:32.400
Who buys a single person?

18
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:33.900
Whoever lights up buys

19
00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:35.000
Miss

20
00:00:35.933 --> 00:00:36.900
Are you a man?

21
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:38.300
If you can't afford the order, what do you want?

22
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:39.200
I can't afford it.

23
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.133
Waiter, he ordered the exact same dish

24
00:00:41.133 --> 00:00:41.900
Bring me a table

25
00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.400
Mr. Chen, he just ordered more than 100,000

26
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:45.766
Just do as Mr. Lu said

27
00:00:45.766 --> 00:00:47.300
He just spent 2 billion

28
00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.366
Buy my queen bed at Long River Hospital

29
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.500
What is a meal?

30
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.166
That rich man is you.

31
00:00:55.866 --> 00:00:58.566
I was joking with my mom just now

32
00:00:58.566 --> 00:01:00.366
Come on, let's talk

33
00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:02.700
You go

34
00:01:03.333 --> 00:01:04.633
No, you're not.
