00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.633
What is he?

2
00:00:01.733 --> 00:00:03.366
Why don't you say it?

3
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:04.800
Small dare not

4
00:00:06.333 --> 00:00:09.100
Shake hands with me I was wrong

5
00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:10.500
Please forgive me.

6
00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:12.133
I was blinded by villains

7
00:00:12.133 --> 00:00:14.466
It's all him, not you who shot me

8
00:00:14.466 --> 00:00:16.200
Didn't you just say you were going to kill me?

9
00:00:16.333 --> 00:00:18.700
Ah, who did you kill in the end?

10
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.433
The boy knew he was wrong

11
00:00:20.466 --> 00:00:21.500
Pine cave pine cave

12
00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:22.733
There is no way.

13
00:00:22.733 --> 00:00:24.533
He wants to die, we can do it

14
00:00:24.533 --> 00:00:26.400
Then why did I rush you to kill me?

15
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.266
He's at home.

16
00:00:27.866 --> 00:00:29.900
I have thick eyebrows together, shut up for me

17
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.466
Sister Lu, I really know I was wrong, you forgive me

18
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.666
Spare you and give you another chance to kill me

19
00:00:46.733 --> 00:00:47.833
Avenge for you

20
00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:49.500
Do not return

21
00:00:49.766 --> 00:00:52.466
To give you a chance for revenge

22
00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.466
No return no return

23
00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:56.500
Who killed him for me?

24
00:00:59.333 --> 00:01:02.000
Looks like they're not listening to you. Go away

25
00:01:06.333 --> 00:01:07.366
Then don't be noisy

26
00:01:07.366 --> 00:01:08.166
Noisy here
