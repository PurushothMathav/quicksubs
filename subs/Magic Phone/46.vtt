00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:01.500
What am I saying is wrong?

2
00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:03.166
What can he give Xiaoyu to fly?

3
00:00:03.166 --> 00:00:04.266
Do you have a car?

4
00:00:04.266 --> 00:00:05.166
Do you have a room?

5
00:00:05.166 --> 00:00:06.333
Do you have any savings?

6
00:00:06.333 --> 00:00:09.366
And Xiaoxiao, don't say Ducoco

7
00:00:09.366 --> 00:00:10.900
When did you become in love?

8
00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:14.000
He said he had a car, a house, a deposit, and a door

9
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.100
How can you believe it?

10
00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:15.966
Explain

11
00:00:15.966 --> 00:00:18.666
Since it is to save face for you, I can't do nothing

12
00:00:18.666 --> 00:00:20.766
I won't make it difficult for you.

13
00:00:20.766 --> 00:00:23.666
It's not realistic for me to see the garage now

14
00:00:23.666 --> 00:00:25.366
Since you said you have a deposit

15
00:00:25.366 --> 00:00:27.200
Then let me see your bride price

16
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.033
Vita taxes your 200,000 here

17
00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.066
Open a bottle

18
00:00:33.533 --> 00:00:34.800
Enough parts

19
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.466
Luo Xuan, I'm sorry.

20
00:00:36.466 --> 00:00:37.933
I didn't expect this.

21
00:00:37.933 --> 00:00:39.666
Let's go. No

22
00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:41.200
Come out to play

23
00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:42.766
The most important thing is to be happy

24
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.000
How can one bottle be enough for so many of us?

25
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.366
Get 10 bottles

26
00:00:46.866 --> 00:00:47.766
Okay

27
00:00:48.733 --> 00:00:51.666
10 bottles. You know what you're talking about

28
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.466
It seems that Miss Lin is still too little

29
00:00:53.466 --> 00:00:55.100
Then take 100 bottles

30
00:00:55.333 --> 00:00:58.600
Brother, these 100 bottles cost 20 million

31
00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.000
If you place an order in this essence club, you can't return it.

32
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.333
Are you sure you can afford it?

33
00:01:04.333 --> 00:01:06.266
Hmm, this guy

34
00:01:06.333 --> 00:01:07.100
You know what's wrong

35
00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:08.633
Listen to Brother Chicken's advice

36
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:09.900
Leave Yue Fei

37
00:01:09.933 --> 00:01:11.766
An excellent woman like Yue Fei?

38
00:01:11.766 --> 00:01:13.600
A good man like me

39
00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:14.666
To deserve you

40
00:01:17.166 --> 00:01:20.200
Brother Chicken, that means 20 million you can afford

41
00:01:20.366 --> 00:01:21.766
Master you
