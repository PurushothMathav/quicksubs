00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:02.300
You're too crazy to say that

2
00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:05.100
Kitten, why are you here? You still have the face to say

3
00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:06.666
If you hadn't lifted the frame wantonly

4
00:00:06.666 --> 00:00:09.066
How could we spend 1 billion signing talented women

5
00:00:09.066 --> 00:00:11.266
Xiaofang, I think he did it on purpose.

6
00:00:11.266 --> 00:00:14.166
Du Chen, you are also a member of the Du family

7
00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:15.533
How could you do such a thing?

8
00:00:15.533 --> 00:00:18.466
Mom, I just accepted Xinghui Entertainment.

9
00:00:18.466 --> 00:00:20.500
You helped him create Xingyao Media

10
00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.966
Are you the one who doesn't consider me a member of the Du family?

11
00:00:22.966 --> 00:00:25.000
Your brother founded Starshine Media

12
00:00:25.066 --> 00:00:26.866
It's to make you see reality

13
00:00:26.866 --> 00:00:29.633
Besides, managing companies is not your strong suit

14
00:00:29.766 --> 00:00:32.200
You'd better return the company to your brother as soon as possible

15
00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.700
What do you want me to say?

16
00:00:34.733 --> 00:00:36.866
You are still an honest female pet at home

17
00:00:36.866 --> 00:00:39.800
How nice that you're going to marry your neighbor anyway

18
00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.200
Du Chen, we are all for your own good.

19
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:43.666
Why don't you listen to advice?

20
00:00:43.666 --> 00:00:46.466
I can make hundreds of millions by buying any stock

21
00:00:46.466 --> 00:00:48.466
The management company is making more money every day

22
00:00:48.466 --> 00:00:49.400
Not to mention

23
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.466
I now own more than half of the vacation's assets

24
00:00:52.933 --> 00:00:54.566
You let me return

25
00:00:54.966 --> 00:00:56.333
I'm afraid my brain is sick

26
00:00:56.333 --> 00:00:58.766
Du Chen, don't put gold on your face

27
00:00:58.766 --> 00:01:00.466
If it weren't for Lin Jia helping you behind your back

28
00:01:00.466 --> 00:01:02.100
You are a piece of crap

29
00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.300
Oh, I remember now.

30
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.600
Even the plan to sign the talent and beauty

31
00:01:05.766 --> 00:01:07.600
It's also your neighbor who instructs you behind your back

32
00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.166
What is your neighbor?

33
00:01:09.333 --> 00:01:10.500
Also instruct me

34
00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.466
Don't pretend to be garlic, you have no resources and no background

35
00:01:13.466 --> 00:01:15.133
Manage the company by yourself

36
00:01:15.133 --> 00:01:17.566
It must be hard work, right?

37
00:01:17.566 --> 00:01:18.766
I also heard

38
00:01:18.766 --> 00:01:21.366
In order to sign a small live streaming host of the Qin family

39
00:01:21.366 --> 00:01:23.200
Go to great lengths to please the Qin family

40
00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.466
It made people laugh out loud when it got out.

41
00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.600
The little live streaming host you mentioned

42
00:01:31.133 --> 00:01:32.766
Could it be him?

43
00:01:33.866 --> 00:01:35.100
80 million a week.

44
00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.200
How is that possible?
