00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.300
Miss, the master urges you to go back as soon as possible

2
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:07.300
Got it.

3
00:00:08.133 --> 00:00:08.933
Come on.

4
00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:11.200
Gu family boy

5
00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.800
I officially apologize to you for what happened last time.

6
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:15.233
Are you willing to marry Qingyao?

7
00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:16.900
I am very happy.

8
00:00:17.666 --> 00:00:18.800
Mr. Lin is out of prison

9
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.333
Although the Lin family is not as good as the Du family

10
00:00:20.333 --> 00:00:22.166
But it is also a wealthy family in Jiang Province

11
00:00:22.166 --> 00:00:24.166
I think there are quite a few people who should be in line

12
00:00:24.166 --> 00:00:25.500
I want to marry Miss Lin

13
00:00:25.966 --> 00:00:27.866
You still have some eyesight.

14
00:00:27.866 --> 00:00:28.600
Yes!

15
00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:31.466
In the past two years, I have helped Qingyao choose a husband

16
00:00:31.533 --> 00:00:33.600
But I worried about a head of white hair

17
00:00:33.766 --> 00:00:36.933
Haha, the courage of your grandfather Du family boy

18
00:00:36.933 --> 00:00:38.966
I have to admire the old man

19
00:00:38.966 --> 00:00:39.366
I see

20
00:00:39.366 --> 00:00:41.600
Is it not just my performance that Mr. Lin likes?

21
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.433
You are a marginal figure in the Du family

22
00:00:43.533 --> 00:00:45.866
Du Feiyun will be supported to inherit the family business

23
00:00:45.866 --> 00:00:46.733
And you

24
00:00:46.733 --> 00:00:49.533
It is destined to become a stumbling block for Du Feiyun to reach the top

25
00:00:49.533 --> 00:00:52.000
How do you know these things, Mr. Lin?

26
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.766
I still heard some information about the Berlin family

27
00:00:55.166 --> 00:00:57.066
One thing I'm curious about

28
00:00:57.133 --> 00:00:59.066
500 million signed a live streaming host.

29
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.100
See through the violence of talented and beautiful people

30
00:01:01.166 --> 00:01:03.966
How do you know these things?
