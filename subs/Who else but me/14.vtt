1
00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:03.200
I'll ask you again.

2
00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:05.666
Is it expensive or not?

3
00:00:05.666 --> 00:00:07.833
Feiyun is willing to admit defeat

4
00:00:08.266 --> 00:00:09.433
Do you hear me?

5
00:00:09.466 --> 00:00:12.000
Mom made you kneel

6
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:13.100
how

7
00:00:13.866 --> 00:00:16.700
You don't even listen to your mother's words?

8
00:00:21.366 --> 00:00:23.833
I did it before

9
00:00:24.666 --> 00:00:27.000
Please forgive me not too late

10
00:00:27.533 --> 00:00:29.466
Your brother knelt down and apologized to you

11
00:00:29.466 --> 00:00:31.166
Why don't you get him up soon?

12
00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.266
I'm going to let you know bit by bit

13
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.266
The so-called Du family reporter

14
00:00:42.933 --> 00:00:45.066
It's not even a fart in my eyes

15
00:00:45.566 --> 00:00:47.633
You are Kaita.

16
00:00:49.466 --> 00:00:50.566
Okay, okay.

17
00:00:50.566 --> 00:00:51.866
You all go out

18
00:00:52.566 --> 00:00:55.400
I have something to talk to Du Chen alone

19
00:01:04.766 --> 00:01:07.566
I still have some things to discuss with Xiao Adan

20
00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.566
The cooperation is up to you.

21
00:01:09.566 --> 00:01:10.766
It's the second young master

22
00:01:13.066 --> 00:01:14.366
How young and promising

23
00:01:14.366 --> 00:01:16.700
Then we'll retire first.

24
00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.700
Du Chen, how dare you?

25
00:01:27.366 --> 00:01:28.166
Xiaoman

26
00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:30.566
You leave me alone

27
00:01:30.566 --> 00:01:32.766
Didn't you default to what happened last time?

28
00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.300
Did I misunderstand?

29
00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:35.300
Nonsense

30
00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:37.033
When did I promise you?

31
00:01:37.066 --> 00:01:38.766
I asked you to stay today

32
00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:40.700
I want to talk to you about business

33
00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.066
Why is it just the two of us now?

34
00:01:44.066 --> 00:01:45.300
What's the business?

35
00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:46.766
Do you still need me to teach you?

36
00:01:47.166 --> 00:01:48.400
Du Chen, let go

37
00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.600
I'm here to talk to you about my fiancÃ©e

38
00:01:51.066 --> 00:01:51.866
fiancee

39
00:01:52.733 --> 00:01:53.600
Exactly.

40
00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:57.166
Your father left you a marriage before he died

41
00:01:57.366 --> 00:02:00.800
The eldest lady next door, Lin Qingyao
