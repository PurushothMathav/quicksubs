00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:04.700
Ah hahahahaha young master

2
00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:06.600
Master Dust

3
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:08.500
Got you, leprechaun

4
00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:10.633
Hahaha, don't make trouble.

5
00:00:10.733 --> 00:00:12.000
So many people watching

6
00:00:12.066 --> 00:00:14.866
Yo, it turned out to be sister-in-law, eh?

7
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.866
How are you doing with what I gave you?

8
00:00:18.866 --> 00:00:20.666
The amount of virtual money you invest skyrockets

9
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:21.700
Put in 1 billion

10
00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:23.000
Now it's up by tens of billions

11
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.200
Lu Chen, you are really a genius

12
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.766
I said earlier that there is nothing wrong with being my woman, right?

13
00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.233
You won't regret it.

14
00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:31.333
Oh look

15
00:00:31.333 --> 00:00:32.900
Here is the list of candidates you want

16
00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.000
The future of the semiconductor industry is uncertain

17
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.833
If you enter blindly now, you may pay.

18
00:00:38.133 --> 00:00:40.133
Semiconductors are the core industry of the future

19
00:00:40.133 --> 00:00:41.900
You won't lose any money if you invest.

20
00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.566
But now we don't have a company.

21
00:00:43.566 --> 00:00:45.066
There's no R & amp; D.

22
00:00:45.133 --> 00:00:48.166
The Du Group owns a Shunyang Technology

23
00:00:48.166 --> 00:00:49.600
Buy him now

24
00:00:56.933 --> 00:01:01.433
Mr. Zhao is currently in a downturn in the semiconductor industry market

25
00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.666
Serious losses within the consortium

26
00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.300
We had no choice but to sell the company

27
00:01:07.533 --> 00:01:09.700
Shenyang Technology is now worth 1.50 billion

28
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.833
It can only be sold at most 1 billion it doesn't matter

29
00:01:15.166 --> 00:01:17.666
As long as you can release good news to the outside world

30
00:01:17.666 --> 00:01:20.333
We can increase the market value of the company at any time

31
00:01:20.333 --> 00:01:21.566
That's not good.

32
00:01:21.566 --> 00:01:23.100
What's wrong with that?

33
00:01:23.333 --> 00:01:25.100
A message for 500 million

34
00:01:25.533 --> 00:01:28.766
Straight people think about this little money all day

35
00:01:29.066 --> 00:01:30.266
That's all

36
00:01:30.466 --> 00:01:32.700
No, what are you doing here?

37
00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:34.600
I 2 billion
