00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.633
Stupid you are such an idiot

2
00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.000
Spent 3 billion to buy Dongcheng District but lost money

3
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.800
Do you know what that 31 position is?

4
00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:10.266
It's all Du Chen's fault

5
00:00:10.266 --> 00:00:11.133
If not for him

6
00:00:11.133 --> 00:00:12.666
I can't possibly put all my money in it either

7
00:00:12.666 --> 00:00:15.466
Enough, I don't want to make excuses for you anymore

8
00:00:15.466 --> 00:00:17.700
What? You must still have money, right?

9
00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.533
My dad is gone, but you have all his money

10
00:00:20.533 --> 00:00:22.066
What? Please help me again.

11
00:00:22.066 --> 00:00:23.933
Where do I have money

12
00:00:23.933 --> 00:00:25.966
You know it's 2 billion I laugh

13
00:00:25.966 --> 00:00:27.400
I don't believe in anything.

14
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:28.333
You must still have money

15
00:00:28.333 --> 00:00:29.266
You help me again.

16
00:00:29.266 --> 00:00:32.600
Du Feiyun, you are crazy, let me go

17
00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.066
Do you still have a little Du?

18
00:00:34.066 --> 00:00:35.300
The way the family lives

19
00:00:35.466 --> 00:00:36.866
Pony, please help me again.

20
00:00:36.866 --> 00:00:38.466
I beg you to help me again

21
00:00:38.466 --> 00:00:40.000
Du Chen is right

22
00:00:40.166 --> 00:00:41.666
You are such a piece of crap

23
00:00:42.133 --> 00:00:44.233
Du Chen is Du Chen again

24
00:00:44.466 --> 00:00:45.400
It's not over with you

25
00:00:47.533 --> 00:00:48.166
Du Chen

26
00:00:48.166 --> 00:00:50.333
Two more directors are absent from the board today

27
00:00:50.333 --> 00:00:51.800
And they are all newlyweds of the Du family

28
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.766
I suspect it's Du Feiyun's trajectory again

29
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.466
Du Feiyun is finally going to make a move

30
00:00:55.466 --> 00:00:57.766
You kept them for today

31
00:00:58.266 --> 00:01:00.466
Let's go and see what they do
