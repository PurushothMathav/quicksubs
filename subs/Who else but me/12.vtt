1
00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:02.400
The Black Dragon Chamber of Commerce presented Mr. Du Chen

2
00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:04.300
A set of Yunlong Tianque Manor

3
00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:05.200
Dove family

4
00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:08.100
Give Mr. Du Chen a handmade supercar as a gift.

5
00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:09.366
Solo Chamber of Commerce

6
00:00:09.366 --> 00:00:12.433
Give Mr. Du Chen an unlimited black card

7
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.133
I'm waiting for the Chamber of Commerce to say

8
00:00:18.133 --> 00:00:20.300
I implore Mr. Du Chen to choose our Chamber of Commerce

9
00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:21.700
Invest in Shunyang Technology

10
00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:22.700
Humph

11
00:00:23.133 --> 00:00:26.500
These three gifts are estimated to be worth tens of billions

12
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
How can Du Chen enjoy such a great gift?

13
00:00:31.166 --> 00:00:31.966
cannot

14
00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:34.033
You are the actor he is looking for

15
00:00:34.133 --> 00:00:35.866
Your head is full of anger

16
00:00:35.866 --> 00:00:37.500
I can't tell if it's real or fake.

17
00:00:37.533 --> 00:00:39.533
Great, Du Chen has this investment

18
00:00:39.533 --> 00:00:40.866
We can soar

19
00:00:40.866 --> 00:00:43.700
Now, semiconductor chips are age-old.

20
00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.566
People sell them, and they are all cheap.

21
00:00:48.266 --> 00:00:50.766
Did you make a mistake?

22
00:00:50.766 --> 00:00:52.366
Just rely on him

23
00:00:52.366 --> 00:00:53.700
What are you?

24
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.066
Dare to insult Mr. Du

25
00:00:55.133 --> 00:00:57.466
Our vision is also something you can question.

26
00:00:57.466 --> 00:00:58.966
Roll Du Chen

27
00:00:59.166 --> 00:01:01.500
What you just said is true

28
00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:04.633
That project is really worth trillions

29
00:01:06.166 --> 00:01:06.966
That's impossible.

30
00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.100
He's just a trash raised by the Du family

31
00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:10.566
How could he possibly know this?

32
00:01:10.666 --> 00:01:12.766
There must be someone behind him

33
00:01:12.933 --> 00:01:14.000
How am I?

34
00:01:14.166 --> 00:01:15.900
I want you to take care of it.

35
00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:17.166
Oh, right.

36
00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.633
Didn't you just say you were going to screw your head off?

37
00:01:20.766 --> 00:01:22.066
Kick me as a ball?

38
00:01:22.066 --> 00:01:23.966
Ahahaha

39
00:01:25.066 --> 00:01:25.900
What do you want?

40
00:01:26.133 --> 00:01:27.833
What pony save me

41
00:01:27.933 --> 00:01:29.000
Enough, Dochen

42
00:01:29.133 --> 00:01:30.766
Your brother is just kidding

43
00:01:30.866 --> 00:01:32.333
You don't have to take it seriously.

44
00:01:32.333 --> 00:01:34.800
Then I just want to play a joke with him.

45
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Is there a problem? Haha.
