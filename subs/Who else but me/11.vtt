00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.233
Zhao Bingrui is the company's president

2
00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:04.466
How can he like a piece of trash like you?

3
00:00:04.766 --> 00:00:05.666
Mom

4
00:00:06.133 --> 00:00:08.833
I told you to have a deep communication with me.

5
00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:12.133
My ability is super strong

6
00:00:12.133 --> 00:00:13.066
You haha

7
00:00:13.066 --> 00:00:16.866
Even if you use some tricks to sign the company, what can you do?

8
00:00:16.866 --> 00:00:19.433
Shunyang Technology's current market value is only 1 billion

9
00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.500
And you want to use 3 billion to do it

10
00:00:21.666 --> 00:00:24.000
Then in the end, I will still be the one making money, right?

11
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.566
Yes, the semiconductor industry is suffering from severe losses.

12
00:00:27.766 --> 00:00:29.600
Even if you get the company

13
00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:32.033
Won't it still go bankrupt and liquidate?

14
00:00:32.366 --> 00:00:34.000
Development of the semiconductor industry

15
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.300
A short-sighted person like you

16
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.033
I don't understand the market at all

17
00:00:38.533 --> 00:00:39.366
Visitors

18
00:00:40.333 --> 00:00:43.366
I have bought the most cutting-edge technology patents

19
00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:47.033
And plan new semiconductor chip R&D projects

20
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:48.733
In less than a month

21
00:00:48.733 --> 00:00:51.000
It can bring the company a profit of 10 billion

22
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.100
Hum 10 billion

23
00:00:53.166 --> 00:00:55.666
Do you think you can invite some actors?

24
00:00:55.666 --> 00:00:57.633
It can fool us.

25
00:00:57.733 --> 00:00:59.800
Tell you the whole country

26
00:01:00.133 --> 00:01:02.900
Everyone knows that you, Du Chen, are a waste.

27
00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.433
No one will invest in your project.

28
00:01:06.566 --> 00:01:07.766
10 more minutes

29
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.700
People from the world's three largest chambers of commerce will come to me to sign contracts

30
00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.900
What are the three major chambers of commerce?

31
00:01:14.533 --> 00:01:17.400
No, I heard it right, of course.

32
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.533
The three chambers of commerce are the top three in the world.

33
00:01:22.533 --> 00:01:25.066
Interview them about the wealth in their hands

34
00:01:25.066 --> 00:01:27.366
It can be said that it is 1/10 of the world's

35
00:01:27.366 --> 00:01:28.533
Even our Du

36
00:01:28.533 --> 00:01:31.200
In their eyes, they are nothing more than ants.

37
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.600
People like them who are high and mighty

38
00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.500
There's no way I can go to jail with you

39
00:01:36.733 --> 00:01:38.000
I already said that

40
00:01:38.366 --> 00:01:40.533
A short-sighted person like you

41
00:01:40.533 --> 00:01:42.100
I don't understand the market at all

42
00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:42.900
Break

43
00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:44.166
Then tell me

44
00:01:44.266 --> 00:01:45.733
If people from the three major chambers of commerce

45
00:01:45.733 --> 00:01:47.466
Can I really come and sign a contract with you?

46
00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.900
I'll twist my head off and let you kick it like a ball

47
00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:51.766
The three major chambers of commerce
