00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.233
You're going to stand up to this kick, Du Chen

2
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:06.733
Your brother knew he was wrong.

3
00:00:06.733 --> 00:00:08.000
Just forgive him

4
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.900
Ok if his life

5
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.033
Gotta get something for it

6
00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:16.800
There is a new club entertainment under the consortium.

7
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.400
Then he can change your brother's head office, right?

8
00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.166
Future live broadcast industry novelty

9
00:00:20.366 --> 00:00:22.833
That's the beauty of making money lying down

10
00:00:24.133 --> 00:00:27.033
Sure, but I have one more condition.

11
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:31.733
He had to get on his knees and kowtow and apologize.

12
00:00:31.733 --> 00:00:33.466
Du Chen, you are dreaming

13
00:00:34.133 --> 00:00:36.066
Okay, Du Chen flies far

14
00:00:36.466 --> 00:00:38.200
You go and give him the company tomorrow

15
00:00:38.533 --> 00:00:41.300
What wedding entertainment is my hard work

16
00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.666
How can it be worth more than ten billion?

17
00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.966
You don't even listen to me now, do you?

18
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.800
Yes

19
00:00:57.733 --> 00:00:59.100
Hey Du Feiyun

20
00:00:59.133 --> 00:01:00.500
Have you forgotten?

21
00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.400
Are you going to kneel and kowtow to me and apologize?

22
00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:06.300
Luo Chen, I am also the young master of the Du family, you are not cheating

23
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.633
Then I'll call until you fulfill it.

24
00:01:13.933 --> 00:01:16.066
Du Chen stop me

25
00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.566
I'm going to ask you one last time.

26
00:01:19.566 --> 00:01:22.500
To kneel or not to kneel?
