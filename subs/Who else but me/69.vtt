00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.633
You are Du Chen

2
00:00:01.666 --> 00:00:03.300
Come and catch him for me

3
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:04.300
Why arrest people

4
00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:06.466
Your company has a number of substandard regulations

5
00:00:06.466 --> 00:00:07.333
Need rectification

6
00:00:07.333 --> 00:00:09.066
Du Chen as a company director

7
00:00:09.166 --> 00:00:10.233
Deserves punishment

8
00:00:10.533 --> 00:00:11.433
Senior official jiang

9
00:00:11.466 --> 00:00:13.800
All our operations are in legal compliance

10
00:00:13.933 --> 00:00:15.933
You need evidence to say this.

11
00:00:15.933 --> 00:00:18.000
Evidence you want evidence

12
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.166
The injuries on my godson's body are evidence

13
00:00:20.466 --> 00:00:22.700
Godmother, look how he beat me

14
00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:24.400
You think you need help?

15
00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:25.966
Can hold me down

16
00:00:25.966 --> 00:00:26.733
Du Chen

17
00:00:26.733 --> 00:00:29.266
Don't be complacent, why do I have to arrest you?

18
00:00:29.266 --> 00:00:31.500
Even putting the company out of business is a matter of minutes

19
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.233
Yeah, yeah. You guys are such an eye-opener.

20
00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.500
Stop talking nonsense, I have received a report.

21
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.600
Your company has multiple cases of vulgarity

22
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.266
Give me a shutdown conclusion now

23
00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:42.500
Follow me back to investigate

24
00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:43.300
Du Chen

25
00:00:43.766 --> 00:00:44.666
You have today too

26
00:00:44.666 --> 00:00:46.466
This is what happens when you offend me.

27
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:47.766
When you go to jail

28
00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.833
I see what else are you fighting me with?

29
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.066
Why hurry up and arrest him?

30
00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.400
It seems that Senior Official Jiang is trying to use his power for personal gain

31
00:00:55.466 --> 00:00:57.100
Stand up for your godson

32
00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.733
What is personal gain?

33
00:00:58.733 --> 00:00:59.966
So what if it's not

34
00:01:00.166 --> 00:01:01.600
I'll let you close the door.

35
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.600
We have to close now.

36
00:01:03.666 --> 00:01:04.800
Let me close the door

37
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.466
Just because you don't have the strength

38
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:08.966
Senior official Jiang wants to arrest people

39
00:01:08.966 --> 00:01:10.566
Of course I have nothing to say

40
00:01:10.866 --> 00:01:12.300
However, this document

41
00:01:12.366 --> 00:01:13.766
Come and have a look.
