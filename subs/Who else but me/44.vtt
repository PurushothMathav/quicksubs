00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.266
The little live streaming host you mentioned shouldn't be him, right?

2
00:00:04.566 --> 00:00:07.133
80 million. How is that possible?

3
00:00:07.133 --> 00:00:09.900
Oil sauce is just a small live streaming host of the Qin family

4
00:00:10.166 --> 00:00:11.600
How could it suddenly explode?

5
00:00:11.666 --> 00:00:14.633
He is a live streaming host with millions in my hands

6
00:00:14.733 --> 00:00:16.300
Live stream casually

7
00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:18.200
You can have millions of dollars in income

8
00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:19.700
What do you think I lost?

9
00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:20.866
What are you so excited about?

10
00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:23.133
Wait until the talented and beautiful make me a lot of money

11
00:00:23.133 --> 00:00:24.633
See what you fight with me

12
00:00:24.733 --> 00:00:26.866
Sign a live streaming host that's about to explode

13
00:00:27.066 --> 00:00:29.566
Du Feiyun, you are as stupid as ever

14
00:00:29.566 --> 00:00:31.066
Fart hemp

15
00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:33.900
I've made hundreds since I took over at Du's

16
00:00:33.966 --> 00:00:34.966
On the other hand, the third child

17
00:00:34.966 --> 00:00:36.766
For a live streaming host that's about to explode

18
00:00:36.766 --> 00:00:38.266
Spent billions

19
00:00:38.266 --> 00:00:39.633
in comparison

20
00:00:39.666 --> 00:00:41.900
Who do you think is more suitable for the Du family?

21
00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.900
What? Don't listen to his nonsense!

22
00:00:43.966 --> 00:00:46.166
Of course Du Feiyun doesn't have this strength anymore

23
00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.033
You should have lent it to him, Hachi

24
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.133
You do this

25
00:00:50.133 --> 00:00:52.333
Aren't you afraid of breaking the rules of our Du family?

26
00:00:52.333 --> 00:00:54.400
I lent him this money

27
00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.833
He will naturally pay me back in the future.

28
00:00:59.933 --> 00:01:03.566
Pony, remember to come to me when you are short of money another day.

29
00:01:05.866 --> 00:01:07.466
Leap let's go

30
00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:10.066
No, you can't jump for long

31
00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:11.200
We'll see.

32
00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:19.800
Hello Mr. Du

33
00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.866
Are you busy tonight?

34
00:01:22.333 --> 00:01:23.966
I'd like to treat you to a meal

35
00:01:23.966 --> 00:01:25.600
It is inconvenient for you.

36
00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.000
OK, then I'll see you tonight.
