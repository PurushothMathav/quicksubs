00:00:00.466 --> 00:00:02.166
I see what you rely on to turn over

2
00:00:02.666 --> 00:00:04.000
What are you talking about?

3
00:00:04.066 --> 00:00:06.533
Hello, you are Jiang Shenshen

4
00:00:06.533 --> 00:00:07.566
well-connected

5
00:00:07.566 --> 00:00:09.566
In fact, we already guessed it

6
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:11.733
I can make tens of billions on this waste

7
00:00:11.733 --> 00:00:13.400
Developing new semiconductor projects

8
00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:14.933
It's all your help behind the scenes

9
00:00:14.933 --> 00:00:18.100
You are talking nonsense. This money is obviously earned by Du Chen himself.

10
00:00:18.366 --> 00:00:20.133
How is it possible with him, a piece of trash?

11
00:00:20.133 --> 00:00:21.866
You all wronged me

12
00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.366
Du Chen can earn tens of billions

13
00:00:23.366 --> 00:00:25.066
But we have nothing to do with each other

14
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.133
Mr. Lin knows that you are flattering him

15
00:00:28.133 --> 00:00:29.600
But you saw the fact

16
00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.000
Just this trash

17
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.200
He is a puddle of mud that cannot support the wall

18
00:00:36.066 --> 00:00:37.800
My grandfather has been closed for many years

19
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.766
I will never guide anyone to invest

20
00:00:39.766 --> 00:00:42.533
Let alone the new semiconductors you're talking about.

21
00:00:42.533 --> 00:00:44.500
Our Lin family is not interested in setting up at all

22
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:45.366
Not Lin

23
00:00:45.666 --> 00:00:47.600
Is there someone else behind Du Chen?

24
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.333
The reason why I am dear to the Du family

25
00:00:49.333 --> 00:00:51.200
What I like is the courage in him

26
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.666
It can stir up the situation in the virtual currency market

27
00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:55.800
Gather a trillion-dollar investment

28
00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.866
I don't think so.

29
00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:59.400
But now it seems

30
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:01.300
Not a good match for my granddaughter

31
00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.100
This is the end of the matter

32
00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.066
Groom, please think about it again.

33
00:01:07.066 --> 00:01:09.200
Your Du Consortium suffered this disaster

34
00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.566
It should be controlled quickly.

35
00:01:10.733 --> 00:01:12.833
Otherwise, to the Du Consortium

36
00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.733
There's going to be some impact.

37
00:01:14.733 --> 00:01:15.800
Do you hear me?

38
00:01:15.966 --> 00:01:19.900
Gucheng, I advise you to give me the company as soon as possible

39
00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:21.166
If I am happy

40
00:01:21.166 --> 00:01:22.833
Maybe it can help you eliminate comments.

41
00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.800
That's all it can do now

42
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.500
Looks like you've got me
