WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.666 --> 00:00:02.633
We are the elders of the company

2
00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:05.066
How can you let this trash ride on your head

3
00:00:05.466 --> 00:00:07.066
Let you acquire Shunyang Technology

4
00:00:07.266 --> 00:00:08.400
We don't agree

5
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.600
You're right, we definitely don't agree.

6
00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:12.166
We can't agree

7
00:00:12.166 --> 00:00:13.133
What should I do with Du Chen?

8
00:00:13.133 --> 00:00:14.466
If you can't acquire Shunyang Technology

9
00:00:14.466 --> 00:00:16.300
The previous funds were all wasted

10
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.500
This is a room full of business leaders.

11
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.000
Celebrities of Jiang Province

12
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:22.300
You do this

13
00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.500
Aren't you afraid of ruining the fertility of the Du Group?

14
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.533
Hahahahaha what a joke

15
00:00:27.533 --> 00:00:29.166
The dignitaries of Jiang Province present

16
00:00:29.166 --> 00:00:31.266
They are all here for the face of the third young master

17
00:00:31.266 --> 00:00:32.200
How much?

18
00:00:32.266 --> 00:00:34.966
I think you think a little too highly of yourself

19
00:00:35.133 --> 00:00:36.466
What are you?

20
00:00:36.466 --> 00:00:37.933
Dare to point fingers in front of me

21
00:00:37.933 --> 00:00:39.800
Zhong Lao is your father's right-hand man

22
00:00:39.866 --> 00:00:41.400
Or a shareholder of Newlywed Entertainment

23
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:42.600
How dare you do this to him!

24
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.066
How dare you hit me?

25
00:00:44.133 --> 00:00:45.100
People like you

26
00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:48.300
You don't deserve to be the heir to the Du Corporation

27
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.566
Get out of the consortium

28
00:00:49.566 --> 00:00:50.800
Get out of the consortium

29
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.000
Get out of the consortium

30
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.400
Get out of the consortium

31
00:00:56.366 --> 00:00:57.000
Du Cheng

32
00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.833
The louder you are now, the more meaningful it is to me

33
00:00:59.966 --> 00:01:02.366
Don't blame me for not giving you a chance

34
00:01:02.366 --> 00:01:03.966
You have been at home for 20 years

35
00:01:03.966 --> 00:01:06.466
I will consider selling Shunyang Technology to you.

36
00:01:06.466 --> 00:01:07.066
How did it go?

37
00:01:07.066 --> 00:01:09.100
Du Cheng can take 3 billion is already benevolent

38
00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:10.466
Why let him take 2 billion

39
00:01:10.466 --> 00:01:12.033
Shut the fuck up

40
00:01:12.366 --> 00:01:13.966
This 2 billion if you don't take it

41
00:01:13.966 --> 00:01:16.100
Shunyang Technology, don't even think about it.

42
00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:17.433
I have more money

43
00:01:17.866 --> 00:01:20.666
But this 2 billion I'm feeding the dog

44
00:01:20.666 --> 00:01:23.233
I won't give you this over-and-over trash

45
00:01:23.266 --> 00:01:24.366
Du Chen

46
00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.333
I don't think you understand the situation yet

47
00:01:27.333 --> 00:01:29.533
It 2 billion you don't take it out

48
00:01:29.533 --> 00:01:31.866
Shunyang Technology, don't even think about it.

49
00:01:31.866 --> 00:01:33.033
If you don't believe me

50
00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:34.500
Ask everyone

51
00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.066
He can't take it 5 billion he has to take it out

52
00:01:37.066 --> 00:01:39.566
Because 5 billion we don't sell

53
00:01:39.566 --> 00:01:40.900
Resolutely can't sell

54
00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.200
Do you hear me?

55
00:01:42.533 --> 00:01:43.900
Just a word from me

56
00:01:43.933 --> 00:01:45.566
The whole city goes up and down

57
00:01:45.566 --> 00:01:47.466
Everyone will speak the same voice

58
00:01:47.866 --> 00:01:50.366
No one dares to say yes to me
