1
00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.466
You let me go

2
00:00:01.466 --> 00:00:04.033
That's how you talk to your fiancÃ©

3
00:00:04.133 --> 00:00:05.766
Even if my grandfather promised you

4
00:00:05.766 --> 00:00:07.100
I won't marry you either

5
00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:10.166
I let you go once for the sake of Elder Lin

6
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.400
This time you took the initiative to deliver it to your door

7
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:13.200
Let go of me!

8
00:00:13.766 --> 00:00:15.533
It hurts me.

9
00:00:15.533 --> 00:00:17.566
I'm sorry. I was wrong. I was wrong.

10
00:00:17.566 --> 00:00:18.633
Give me a break.

11
00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:20.600
That's more like it.

12
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Tell me what you're looking for me for

13
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.433
My grandfather asked me to find you

14
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.166
Said I have something for you

15
00:00:28.066 --> 00:00:31.000
Isn't the gift that Mr. Lin wants to give me you?

16
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.400
Let go of me! I'm nothing

17
00:00:34.466 --> 00:00:35.566
You let me go

18
00:00:35.566 --> 00:00:37.300
Otherwise I'm going to tell my grandpa

19
00:00:38.866 --> 00:00:40.900
Sure enough, people are different

20
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.800
Where there is a big place, there is a small place.

21
00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.600
You scold me, didn't you say the leader wants to see me?

22
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:48.466
Come on.
