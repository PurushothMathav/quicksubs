00:00:00.466 --> 00:00:03.366
Feiyun is looking for death. What are you doing here?

2
00:00:03.533 --> 00:00:05.400
Even Dad's woman is sent out

3
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:06.866
I really threw myself into the face of the Du family

4
00:00:06.866 --> 00:00:07.866
What qualifications do you have to say to me?

5
00:00:07.866 --> 00:00:10.200
If it weren't for you, I would have lived in the Du family

6
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.366
Just you

7
00:00:13.166 --> 00:00:16.800
Stinky bitch, I should have known you two were having an affair

8
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.400
Du Chen has nothing to do with me

9
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:21.433
You let me go

10
00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:23.466
I promise I will never trouble you in the future

11
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:25.166
Yes, Du Chen

12
00:00:25.166 --> 00:00:26.200
Or forget it

13
00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.400
The strength of your Qin family, even if you encounter

14
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:29.800
There will also be those who don't want to bother

15
00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.033
Count you

16
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:32.933
What are you?

17
00:00:32.933 --> 00:00:34.533
It is also worthy of being compared to our Du family

18
00:00:34.533 --> 00:00:35.900
How dare you kick me!

19
00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:36.866
Dog stuff

20
00:00:36.866 --> 00:00:39.433
I will never forgive you if you wait for me to go back.

21
00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.700
It's not that easy to leave

22
00:00:43.133 --> 00:00:45.866
Kneel down and kowtow to my little mother and apologize, don't you dare

23
00:00:46.366 --> 00:00:48.800
Ahhh

24
00:00:49.066 --> 00:00:50.266
Sorry, sorry.

25
00:00:50.266 --> 00:00:51.100
I was wrong. I was wrong, Dad

26
00:00:51.266 --> 00:00:52.766
I'll spare you this time.

27
00:00:52.933 --> 00:00:54.533
Let me see you again

28
00:00:54.533 --> 00:00:56.066
You can't go

29
00:00:57.966 --> 00:01:00.400
Next time I see you, don't blame me for being rude to you.

30
00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.200
Du Chen, thank you, kitten

31
00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.300
What is the meaning of light gratitude?

32
00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.400
Do something else
