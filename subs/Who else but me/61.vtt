00:00:00.566 --> 00:00:02.666
Du Chen, tell me the truth

2
00:00:02.666 --> 00:00:04.933
How did you hear about the new urban development project?

3
00:00:04.933 --> 00:00:06.700
Re-planning of Xicheng District

4
00:00:06.966 --> 00:00:09.100
Grandpa, didn't you tell the news?

5
00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:10.300
This Dongcheng District?

6
00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:11.733
Burial mounds discovered

7
00:00:11.733 --> 00:00:14.033
He's pure shit luck

8
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.366
Qingyao Du Chen is your fiancÃ©

9
00:00:17.366 --> 00:00:18.800
You can't talk like that.

10
00:00:19.166 --> 00:00:22.633
I didn't agree to marry him, huh?

11
00:00:23.266 --> 00:00:24.466
Made you laugh

12
00:00:24.466 --> 00:00:26.233
This kid spoils me

13
00:00:26.333 --> 00:00:27.533
It's alright, Mr. Lin

14
00:00:27.533 --> 00:00:29.700
In fact, I'm just gambling this time

15
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:32.900
I heard before that there is a group of tombs underground in Dongcheng District

16
00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.300
So this time I'm sure

17
00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.000
The project will definitely be changed to Xicheng District

18
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:37.933
How dare you?

19
00:00:37.933 --> 00:00:39.666
Much better than I was back then

20
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.200
But then again

21
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.166
This time you hit the Qin family in the face

22
00:00:44.266 --> 00:00:47.100
You will definitely encounter a lot of trouble in the future

23
00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.000
Do you mean to say

24
00:00:49.066 --> 00:00:50.800
There is still Gao behind the Qin family

25
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.466
Qin Yongcheng's godmother is a high-ranking member of Huya

26
00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:54.866
If he intervenes

27
00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.366
He is difficult for us to get through

28
00:00:58.066 --> 00:01:01.233
Is Huya high-rise ginger silk embroidery?

29
00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.866
The original famous ginger silk embroidery

30
00:01:04.266 --> 00:01:06.733
It's Qin Yongzhuang's godmother

31
00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:10.266
So we need to think long term about this.

32
00:01:10.366 --> 00:01:11.466
Don't worry.

33
00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.300
Lin Lao, you put your mind on project development

34
00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.366
I'll take care of the rest.

35
00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:17.700
OK

36
00:01:19.666 --> 00:01:21.266
Du Chen, where are we going now?

37
00:01:21.266 --> 00:01:22.966
Go find a man named Hu Yousheng

38
00:01:23.066 --> 00:01:24.200
He should be at the bar

39
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.600
Who is Hu Yousheng?

40
00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:26.800
You ask too much.

41
00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.566
I'll send someone to check it out
