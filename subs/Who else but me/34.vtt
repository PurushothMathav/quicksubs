1
00:00:00.566 --> 00:00:02.133
I'm here to divorce Du Chen

2
00:00:02.133 --> 00:00:04.033
Divorced Lin Lao

3
00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:06.333
Didn't we discuss the marriage?

4
00:00:06.333 --> 00:00:07.766
What are you doing?

5
00:00:08.066 --> 00:00:09.933
Du Chen spent money on female live streaming hosts

6
00:00:09.933 --> 00:00:11.366
It's all over the Internet.

7
00:00:11.366 --> 00:00:13.100
I don't want to marry such a playboy

8
00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:14.833
It was originally planned to marry the two

9
00:00:15.066 --> 00:00:17.066
But I can't suffer my granddaughter

10
00:00:17.866 --> 00:00:19.800
Today's matter is too involved

11
00:00:20.366 --> 00:00:22.900
You must give me a reasonable explanation

12
00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.366
Du Chen is all done by you

13
00:00:25.366 --> 00:00:27.300
Come over and kneel down and apologize to the leader

14
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.466
I didn't do anything wrong.

15
00:00:28.533 --> 00:00:29.500
Why kneel?

16
00:00:29.766 --> 00:00:30.900
I thought

17
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.466
You can make a splash in the virtual currency market

18
00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.066
Developing new semiconductors

19
00:00:35.166 --> 00:00:36.833
Courage and courage

20
00:00:37.466 --> 00:00:40.600
Now it's just luck for you

21
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.366
If this thing continues to ferment online

22
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:45.566
The future is ruined

23
00:00:45.566 --> 00:00:47.433
Never come back

24
00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.566
Lu Chen, now I see what else you want to fight with me

25
00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:51.866
And that's not easy.

26
00:00:52.133 --> 00:00:54.600
It will be fine when the processing results of Xunbos come out.

27
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.200
The investigation is only now starting

28
00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.300
I'm afraid this clue has long been broken

29
00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.433
If Du Chan really finds the clue

30
00:01:00.533 --> 00:01:02.266
I'm going to be implicated

31
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.700
Third, what are you panicking about?

32
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.666
Are you supporting him behind his back?

33
00:01:07.666 --> 00:01:09.600
Gambler, what nonsense are you talking about?

34
00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.300
How could your brother frame you?

35
00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:12.966
How can this be considered a false accusation?

36
00:01:12.966 --> 00:01:14.366
There will be results soon.

37
00:01:14.366 --> 00:01:16.800
I'm too lazy to ask about your family affairs

38
00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:18.933
I'm going to divorce Du Chen today

39
00:01:18.933 --> 00:01:20.666
If Miss Lin is willing to break off the marriage

40
00:01:20.666 --> 00:01:22.000
It's not that I can't

41
00:01:22.266 --> 00:01:25.000
Anyway, it won't be me who suffers in the end

42
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.900
Shut up
