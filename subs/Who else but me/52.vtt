00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.866
Dust, you have mastered it now

2
00:00:04.866 --> 00:00:06.766
60% of the shares of the Du Group

3
00:00:06.766 --> 00:00:09.233
But there are still some people who support Du Feiyun

4
00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:11.466
I have always opposed you, don't bother with them

5
00:00:11.466 --> 00:00:12.966
Just a bunch of fish

6
00:00:13.133 --> 00:00:13.933
Oh, right

7
00:00:13.933 --> 00:00:17.066
I've been paying attention to the development projects of New City recently.

8
00:00:17.066 --> 00:00:18.500
I heard from an insider.

9
00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:19.666
Dongcheng District will become

10
00:00:19.666 --> 00:00:21.500
Land for new urban development

11
00:00:21.566 --> 00:00:23.466
It may surge in two days.

12
00:00:23.466 --> 00:00:24.966
Something to be expected

13
00:00:24.966 --> 00:00:26.933
But the more they quarreled,

14
00:00:26.933 --> 00:00:27.900
The more beneficial it is to us

15
00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.100
what do you mean

16
00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:32.600
Qiu Ziyu

17
00:00:32.966 --> 00:00:36.300
If I hadn't pitied you and let you stay in the company

18
00:00:36.333 --> 00:00:37.900
How could you achieve what you have today?

19
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.566
Mr. Du should be back.

20
00:00:39.733 --> 00:00:42.366
If you have anything to say, please say it as soon as possible.

21
00:00:42.366 --> 00:00:43.800
I won't make it difficult for you.

22
00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.466
Pingduchen's trust in you

23
00:00:45.466 --> 00:00:47.800
It's not too much to ask him to mobilize 2 billion.

24
00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.400
I can't decide 2 billion

25
00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:51.633
Please go back.

26
00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.466
Zhu Ziyu, don't forget who you are

27
00:00:54.466 --> 00:00:55.266
What

28
00:00:56.166 --> 00:00:58.300
What a coincidence. Why are you here?

29
00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:01.633
Du Chen, why are you here?

30
00:01:01.733 --> 00:01:03.266
Have you forgotten

31
00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.300
This is my company.
