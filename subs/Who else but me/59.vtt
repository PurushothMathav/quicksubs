1
00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:02.433
I give 30 pages

2
00:00:03.333 --> 00:00:05.166
Ming Lao, remember what I said

3
00:00:05.466 --> 00:00:08.166
The land in the east of the city will not become a new development project

4
00:00:08.466 --> 00:00:09.266
Humph

5
00:00:09.733 --> 00:00:11.100
Projects in Dongcheng District

6
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:13.166
Has long been integrated into development projects

7
00:00:13.166 --> 00:00:15.266
Who doesn't know what you're lying about?

8
00:00:15.266 --> 00:00:16.766
I'm telling the truth.

9
00:00:17.066 --> 00:00:18.400
Believe it or not?

10
00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.433
Du Chan, I think you are just jealous

11
00:00:21.466 --> 00:00:24.100
Wait for the project development documents for the new urban area to come down

12
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.500
See what else to say

13
00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:27.833
3 billion time

14
00:00:27.933 --> 00:00:29.366
3 billion twice

15
00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.300
3 billion three deals

16
00:00:32.766 --> 00:00:35.400
The next auction is the development rights of Xicheng District

17
00:00:35.466 --> 00:00:37.700
Due to the particularity of the location of Xicheng District

18
00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:40.366
So the starting price for this auction is only 50 million

19
00:00:40.366 --> 00:00:42.566
Each price increase shall not be less than 10 million

20
00:00:43.066 --> 00:00:44.733
Coming to Shangyin Market

21
00:00:44.733 --> 00:00:47.700
The project plan for the new urban area is set in Dongcheng District

22
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.700
Due to the discovery of large wooden bridges during the development process

23
00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:50.766
Cancel as a last resort

24
00:00:50.766 --> 00:00:53.100
Temporary change of planning location to Xicheng District

25
00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:54.900
So Dongcheng was put on hold.

26
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.900
As a result, many developers lost their money

27
00:00:57.966 --> 00:00:58.800
One hundred million

28
00:00:59.866 --> 00:01:01.933
I finally found my chance

29
00:01:01.933 --> 00:01:03.333
Although this land is worthless

30
00:01:03.333 --> 00:01:05.533
But three billion

31
00:01:05.533 --> 00:01:07.766
Five hundred million, six hundred million.

32
00:01:07.866 --> 00:01:09.200
Six hundred million fifty million

33
00:01:10.333 --> 00:01:13.433
I think this kid might be gouging up prices again

34
00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.600
Don't lie to him again

35
00:01:16.266 --> 00:01:17.166
You're right actually.

36
00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.833
It's just a broken piece of ground

37
00:01:19.266 --> 00:01:20.666
So what if you gave it?

38
00:01:21.366 --> 00:01:23.366
Mr. Du Chen offered 650 million

39
00:01:23.366 --> 00:01:25.033
Is there anything else to remove from the shelves?

40
00:01:26.466 --> 00:01:27.966
650 million a time.

41
00:01:29.333 --> 00:01:30.900
650 million twice

42
00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:33.466
650 million three times

43
00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:36.133
Congratulations, Mr. Gambler

44
00:01:36.133 --> 00:01:37.600
At a price of 650 million

45
00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.400
Buy the development rights of Xicheng District
