1
00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:02.833
Just sign the contract with you

2
00:00:03.333 --> 00:00:04.966
Yoyo is a live star.

3
00:00:04.966 --> 00:00:07.366
His ability to carry goods is nowhere near as talented and beautiful

4
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
And I heard that your brother

5
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.233
And we're getting ready to hit New Drug Media.

6
00:00:12.666 --> 00:00:15.033
To suppress your current Xinhui Entertainment

7
00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:18.600
If he signs the talented and beautiful

8
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.000
What you say is vulgar

9
00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:21.900
how

10
00:00:22.466 --> 00:00:23.766
You think I'm going to lose?

11
00:00:23.933 --> 00:00:24.733
Exactly.

12
00:00:24.933 --> 00:00:27.766
I have carefully compared the live streaming data of the two live streaming hosts.

13
00:00:27.966 --> 00:00:29.366
With the ability of Yoyo Sauce

14
00:00:29.366 --> 00:00:31.466
It's impossible to match the talent and beauty

15
00:00:31.466 --> 00:00:33.566
And now major live broadcast platforms

16
00:00:33.566 --> 00:00:36.566
They are spending a lot of money to sign talented and beautiful people

17
00:00:36.566 --> 00:00:38.733
I am the head of the company's business

18
00:00:38.733 --> 00:00:40.100
Have the right to intervene in this matter

19
00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.066
As expected of the richest girl in the future

20
00:00:42.566 --> 00:00:44.566
It's a pity that the talented and beautiful are very

21
00:00:44.566 --> 00:00:46.266
It will soon be because it is not enough to mock netizens.

22
00:00:46.266 --> 00:00:48.833
Trying so hard to afford his goods, the mine exploded and was investigated

23
00:00:48.866 --> 00:00:50.600
Trigger a regulatory ban

24
00:00:50.666 --> 00:00:52.600
The Yoyo Award is for treating people with sincerity

25
00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.000
Gained a large number of fans

26
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.400
Jump to the top of the live stream

27
00:00:56.733 --> 00:01:00.466
Zhou Ziyu, don't forget that I'm the boss now

28
00:01:00.466 --> 00:01:02.000
You should have followed my instructions

29
00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:04.266
I need an explanation

30
00:01:04.366 --> 00:01:05.566
How about this?

31
00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:07.400
Let's make a bet

32
00:01:07.733 --> 00:01:09.000
What do you want to bet on?

33
00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:10.400
Within one month

34
00:01:10.466 --> 00:01:12.366
Talented and beautiful people, if you don't sign up

35
00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:13.800
I voluntarily resigned as chairperson

36
00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.400
What? No longer in charge of the company?

37
00:01:17.266 --> 00:01:19.133
Ok if I lose

38
00:01:19.133 --> 00:01:21.100
I would like to be your personal secretary

39
00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.600
That's the countdown to what you said.

40
00:01:23.966 --> 00:01:25.166
Don't you regret it
