00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:02.100
Shut up

2
00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.066
Mom, didn't you always want to support Du Feiyun?

3
00:00:05.066 --> 00:00:06.233
Inherit the family business?

4
00:00:06.266 --> 00:00:07.666
I was divorced.

5
00:00:07.733 --> 00:00:09.000
Exactly what you want

6
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:09.833
Yeah little 8

7
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.100
If Du Chan is returned

8
00:00:12.533 --> 00:00:14.500
Can't you accept his common number logically

9
00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:16.233
Capital? If the marriage is annulled

10
00:00:16.366 --> 00:00:18.333
The Lin family will definitely cling to other families

11
00:00:18.333 --> 00:00:19.900
Make enemies for us

12
00:00:20.733 --> 00:00:22.766
Qingyao's divorce is a big deal

13
00:00:22.766 --> 00:00:24.466
You must think carefully, right?

14
00:00:25.166 --> 00:00:26.600
Blame me for being a little mother

15
00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.333
For his usual neglect of discipline

16
00:00:28.333 --> 00:00:30.233
I just did something sorry for you.

17
00:00:30.666 --> 00:00:32.900
Mr. Lin, do you think this is okay?

18
00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.366
My Du family is willing to compensate for part of the assets

19
00:00:35.366 --> 00:00:37.566
Let him join your Lin family

20
00:00:37.566 --> 00:00:39.266
What is this saying?

21
00:00:39.966 --> 00:00:43.133
Are you willing to let you enter the Lin family?

22
00:00:43.133 --> 00:00:44.700
I have no problem with that.

23
00:00:45.166 --> 00:00:46.800
As long as Miss Lin is willing

24
00:00:47.066 --> 00:00:48.500
No backbone at all

25
00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.400
I don't want people like you to join our Lin family

26
00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:53.966
Ok grandpa

27
00:00:53.966 --> 00:00:56.166
You don't really want me to marry him, do you?

28
00:00:56.166 --> 00:00:58.300
Ontario Point Du Chuan

29
00:00:58.666 --> 00:00:59.533
Do you see it?

30
00:00:59.533 --> 00:01:01.633
Why don't you kneel down and apologize to the leader?

31
00:01:01.666 --> 00:01:04.166
If you wait any longer, you won't be able to eat this soft rice

32
00:01:04.166 --> 00:01:06.800
Are you in such a hurry to take over my business?

33
00:01:07.166 --> 00:01:09.466
Now my new drug media has risen

34
00:01:09.466 --> 00:01:11.300
After signing the talented and beautiful woman

35
00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:12.866
Directly become the dictionary of the live broadcast industry

36
00:01:13.133 --> 00:01:15.666
Even if you don't report your embarrassment then

37
00:01:15.666 --> 00:01:17.566
I also trampled you under my feet

38
00:01:17.666 --> 00:01:18.466
Really?

39
00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.600
How can I remember you saying that last time?

40
00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:22.566
Last time

41
00:01:22.666 --> 00:01:24.800
If it weren't for the leader helping you behind your back last time

42
00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.866
What qualifications do you have to earn billions?

43
00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:28.633
Signed contracts with major consortia

44
00:01:29.333 --> 00:01:31.033
This time, Master Lin abandoned you

45
00:01:31.466 --> 00:01:32.966
See what you rely on to turn over

46
00:01:33.533 --> 00:01:34.900
What are you saying?
