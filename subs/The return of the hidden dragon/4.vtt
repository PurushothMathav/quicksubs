00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:01.366
You nonsense

2
00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:03.433
You don't pee. Look in the mirror.

3
00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:04.600
You also deserve

4
00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:07.266
We slept together. Do you think I deserve it?

5
00:00:07.266 --> 00:00:09.300
What nonsense are you talking about?

6
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.800
You forgot that night at the clubhouse

7
00:00:13.166 --> 00:00:15.733
It was you. You called me darling.

8
00:00:15.733 --> 00:00:17.366
Why can't I recognize people when I wear a skirt?

9
00:00:17.366 --> 00:00:18.166
you

10
00:00:19.266 --> 00:00:21.200
I didn't expect to be taken advantage of by you trash

11
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.300
I said, why can't I find anyone in the past?

12
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.400
Xu Hao

13
00:00:25.133 --> 00:00:26.400
You gave me the medicine

14
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.500
So what if I was?

15
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.366
It is your blessing that I can see you

16
00:00:30.366 --> 00:00:31.166
Shen Yunrui

17
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.100
I suggest you take off your clothes now

18
00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:34.300
Wait for me in bed

19
00:00:34.366 --> 00:00:37.166
Otherwise, I'll put you on the shelves in minutes.

20
00:00:37.666 --> 00:00:39.633
Are you shameless?

21
00:00:40.133 --> 00:00:41.333
What happened to the Shen family?

22
00:00:41.333 --> 00:00:43.833
Shen's Pharmaceutical is now in urgent need of a rare raw material

23
00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:46.533
Without this raw material, production cannot continue

24
00:00:46.533 --> 00:00:49.266
Once it cannot be produced, it will face

25
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.066
Billions in breach of contract compensation

26
00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.200
rare raw material

27
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.366
These raw materials

28
00:00:53.366 --> 00:00:56.400
But the world's top medical scientists have developed

29
00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.166
It took three months to refine

30
00:00:58.166 --> 00:00:59.933
There are 2 kilograms in the world.

31
00:00:59.933 --> 00:01:01.500
It's all in the hands of Zhou Lao

32
00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.733
That's a trillion, trillion dollars.

33
00:01:04.733 --> 00:01:07.300
Uh, you said Zhou Lao

34
00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:08.900
Is that Zhou Tianhao?

35
00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.500
You can also mention the name of Waste Zhou Lao

36
00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.100
Mr. Zhou is the richest man in China

37
00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.333
God-like existence

38
00:01:15.333 --> 00:01:16.800
As long as I contact him

39
00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.000
You will receive this unique forgiveness

40
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.166
This opportunity

41
00:01:20.166 --> 00:01:23.066
It's you who can't deceive for a lifetime

42
00:01:24.066 --> 00:01:27.100
Isn't it just a hundred billion forgiveness? I'll help you with this.

43
00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.433
How do you do it? Ouch.

44
00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.000
It's not 100 billion.

45
00:01:31.166 --> 00:01:33.866
Trash, do you know how much is 100 billion?

46
00:01:33.866 --> 00:01:35.133
People like you

47
00:01:35.133 --> 00:01:37.633
I'm afraid I won't be able to earn it back in eighteen lifetimes

48
00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.566
Okay, stop fooling around and go

49
00:01:40.566 --> 00:01:45.033
Hey, you have to be more confident in your man

50
00:01:45.266 --> 00:01:48.100
Who killed him today?

51
00:01:48.166 --> 00:01:50.000
I 1 million

52
00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.333
How dare you hit my man?

53
00:01:58.333 --> 00:02:00.866
I made you unable to get along in Yuzhou

54
00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:02.866
Wait

55
00:02:04.166 --> 00:02:04.966
Hey

56
00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:10.066
Xu Hao will take revenge

57
00:02:10.066 --> 00:02:13.266
You provoked him, you don't want to live anymore, you

58
00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.600
Are you concerned about me?

59
00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:16.900
glib

60
00:02:17.766 --> 00:02:19.833
Okay, I have something to do

61
00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:21.900
This is my phone.

62
00:02:21.933 --> 00:02:25.966
Call me if you have anything

63
00:02:28.766 --> 00:02:29.800
Kind of interesting.

64
00:02:32.866 --> 00:02:35.900
Good Sunday, take the rare raw materials in your hands

65
00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:37.966
Come to Junhe Hotel immediately to hell
