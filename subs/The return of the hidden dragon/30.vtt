1
00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:01.966
What did you say, order two?

2
00:00:02.266 --> 00:00:04.533
That means the entire collection

3
00:00:04.533 --> 00:00:06.200
You have to pay twice the price.

4
00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:07.533
Of course I know that

5
00:00:07.533 --> 00:00:09.700
What? Is he crazy?

6
00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:11.100
No one has started bidding yet

7
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:13.466
He actually lit two glass deformed lamps at once

8
00:00:14.166 --> 00:00:15.400
This is two

9
00:00:15.666 --> 00:00:17.400
Does he have the strength?

10
00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.366
Feed me two glazed seven-star knives, but they are doubled

11
00:00:21.366 --> 00:00:22.600
Do you have any money?

12
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.400
Don't worry about Xu Sheng

13
00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.333
I really don't know where you got the courage

14
00:00:26.333 --> 00:00:28.300
Just order two knives at a time

15
00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:30.966
Xu Sheng is so rich

16
00:00:30.966 --> 00:00:31.766
or

17
00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.000
You come up again to point the knife

18
00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.300
You think everyone is like you

19
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.866
Head caught in the door

20
00:00:39.166 --> 00:00:41.600
Do you know what you are doing in the morning?

21
00:00:41.766 --> 00:00:43.100
You don't want to die

22
00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.900
Did you put your heart in your stomach?

23
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:48.200
I have my reasons for doing this

24
00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:49.100
You Are Me

25
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.600
What if he doesn't come up with the money in the end?

26
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.166
Didn't you hear what the host said just now?

27
00:00:53.166 --> 00:00:54.233
Shame in public

28
00:00:54.666 --> 00:00:55.966
You trash

29
00:00:55.966 --> 00:00:58.133
This kind of person really regards himself as a rich man

30
00:00:58.133 --> 00:01:00.233
You're playing with your life

31
00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:02.800
Start the next collection?

32
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.466
Next Collection Tang Dynasty Bodhi Flowing Gold Bronze Mirror

33
00:01:06.533 --> 00:01:08.133
Base price 80 million

34
00:01:08.133 --> 00:01:10.500
Each increase must not be less than 10 million

35
00:01:10.666 --> 00:01:11.633
80 million

36
00:01:12.333 --> 00:01:13.366
I give 90 million

37
00:01:13.366 --> 00:01:15.900
120 million plus 3

38
00:01:16.166 --> 00:01:18.466
What? Is this guy crazy?

39
00:01:18.566 --> 00:01:20.366
That's five of them.

40
00:01:20.466 --> 00:01:21.433
5 in total

41
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.100
300 billion.

42
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.100
Spend 300 billion on these two products

43
00:01:25.133 --> 00:01:26.700
Is this guy crazy?

44
00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.333
I heard he's just a junk picker

45
00:01:29.333 --> 00:01:30.700
Can you come up with that much money?

46
00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.966
Forget it, there's no mistake.

47
00:01:32.966 --> 00:01:34.400
That's not rigorous.

48
00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.000
How dare you let such a trash in?

49
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.066
Old Jean venue

50
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:38.566
director

51
00:01:38.566 --> 00:01:41.400
I seriously suspect that this position disrupts the order of the venue

52
00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.566
I request that it be recapitalized
