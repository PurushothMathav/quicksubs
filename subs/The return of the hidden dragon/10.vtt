00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:03.133
Hmph, you're really addicted to pretending

2
00:00:03.133 --> 00:00:05.166
Think of yourself as the king of heaven, right?

3
00:00:05.166 --> 00:00:07.400
I hope you're still so arrogant later

4
00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.800
Ouch my little liver

5
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.400
You scared me to death!

6
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:12.933
You are better than Xu Shao

7
00:00:12.933 --> 00:00:15.566
You are the stinky water in the gutter

8
00:00:15.766 --> 00:00:18.733
You should put it in the gutter

9
00:00:18.733 --> 00:00:20.633
Don't stand here taking up space

10
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:22.366
You say you are not filial

11
00:00:22.566 --> 00:00:25.200
We raised you for 20 years in vain

12
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.866
It's useless when it's critical

13
00:00:29.066 --> 00:00:32.400
Okay, okay, cousin, you are really amazing

14
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.866
Don't forget me when you are rich

15
00:00:36.166 --> 00:00:37.166
Feifei you

16
00:00:37.966 --> 00:00:39.900
Even if you become Xu Hao's girlfriend

17
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:41.133
Don't be so crazy

18
00:00:41.133 --> 00:00:44.066
My dignified young master can still say this

19
00:00:44.066 --> 00:00:45.866
You stinky trash picker

20
00:00:45.866 --> 00:00:47.900
Did you get kicked in the head by a donkey?

21
00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:49.166
Go away go away

22
00:00:49.166 --> 00:00:50.766
Don't stand here polluting the air

23
00:00:50.766 --> 00:00:53.766
Nonsense if you dare to talk nonsense again

24
00:00:53.766 --> 00:00:56.066
Believe it or not, I'll pick up your eyeballs as

25
00:00:56.066 --> 00:00:58.966
If Lao Zhou doesn't come within a minute of breaking the money

26
00:00:59.133 --> 00:01:00.700
I'll lend you an arm

27
00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:03.366
Then get on your knees and get out

28
00:01:03.366 --> 00:01:04.866
What if he comes?

29
00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:07.000
If he comes

30
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.866
I will eat shit upside down and then get out

31
00:01:10.933 --> 00:01:12.166
This is what you said.

32
00:01:12.166 --> 00:01:13.300
Are you all listening?

33
00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:15.200
I have to be a witness

34
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.800
waste

35
00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.800
Today I will show you how to write the word death

36
00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.300
It's not certain who will die.
