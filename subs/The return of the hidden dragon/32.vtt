00:00:02.266 --> 00:00:05.500
Kid, the first two are just smoke bombs

2
00:00:05.666 --> 00:00:08.333
If I do this, I can break you to pieces

3
00:00:08.333 --> 00:00:11.066
Now let me see what you tell me

4
00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.000
Haha senior

5
00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:16.800
This 2 billion must be the entire asset of the female scientist

6
00:00:17.333 --> 00:00:18.666
Hum a joke

7
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
How can I have only 2 billion assets?

8
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:23.566
Two more

9
00:00:23.933 --> 00:00:25.833
You can only get up to 30% off at auction.

10
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.366
All the bricks were lit.

11
00:00:27.366 --> 00:00:30.166
Didn't you say he was just a junk picker?

12
00:00:30.166 --> 00:00:32.466
Why can he keep doing it again and again?

13
00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:33.666
Click on the glass to smash it

14
00:00:33.666 --> 00:00:36.133
Sir, it's 600 billion now.

15
00:00:36.133 --> 00:00:38.200
I just sold you for all 18 generations.

16
00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:39.566
It's not worth the money.

17
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:40.466
Sir?

18
00:00:40.933 --> 00:00:43.966
Are you sure you want to fill seven glazed seven-star lamps?

19
00:00:43.966 --> 00:00:45.166
Order now.

20
00:00:45.166 --> 00:00:46.166
Take the liberty to ask

21
00:00:46.166 --> 00:00:47.466
Who are you?

22
00:00:47.466 --> 00:00:49.366
I presided over the auction for so long

23
00:00:49.533 --> 00:00:51.500
This has never happened before.

24
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.466
Just order it.

25
00:00:53.466 --> 00:00:55.066
You kid deliberately turned against me, didn't you?

26
00:00:55.066 --> 00:00:56.666
We all rely on our abilities

27
00:00:56.933 --> 00:00:58.566
Why do you say I'm against you?

28
00:00:58.566 --> 00:01:00.166
Hum host

29
00:01:00.166 --> 00:01:03.100
I seriously doubt that the dead man found the venue room

30
00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.300
I suggest pulling it out directly

31
00:01:05.333 --> 00:01:06.466
Peeling cramp

32
00:01:06.533 --> 00:01:07.566
Broken Tiger Ash

33
00:01:07.733 --> 00:01:09.466
He said light up seven lights.

34
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.000
But as far as I know

35
00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.000
He's a junk picker.

36
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.800
Where can he pay 6 gold?

37
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.100
So what if he's not disrupting?

38
00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.100
I can prove he's a junk picker

39
00:01:21.266 --> 00:01:23.633
And I said, "How does it light up all the time?"

40
00:01:23.766 --> 00:01:26.466
It turned out that I couldn't afford to disrupt the venue here

41
00:01:26.466 --> 00:01:28.400
For this disruption of the venue under despicable circumstances

42
00:01:29.066 --> 00:01:29.866
Kill him

43
00:01:29.966 --> 00:01:34.700
Waste him, waste him, waste him, waste him, waste him

44
00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.566
The world's three largest consortia
