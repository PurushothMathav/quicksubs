00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:09.800
Dear Mr. Buttersle

2
00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:10.966
Our Xu family

3
00:00:10.966 --> 00:00:13.266
I want to invite you to dinner many times, but I haven't invited you.

4
00:00:13.366 --> 00:00:16.133
But why are you so pure and fake about this trash?

5
00:00:16.133 --> 00:00:17.466
Summer vacation is a strong thing

6
00:00:17.466 --> 00:00:20.000
Don't mess with wild shell waterline scales

7
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.700
Is this $3 trillion enough for the seven lights?

8
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:24.866
Enough, Mr. Four

9
00:00:24.866 --> 00:00:27.100
Don't talk about those 7 glazed seven-star lamps

10
00:00:27.133 --> 00:00:28.600
Even if you want to buy this game

11
00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:29.900
All items at auction

12
00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:31.000
No problem.

13
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:32.466
How could this be?

14
00:00:32.533 --> 00:00:33.600
How could this be?

15
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.300
Just a junk picker

16
00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.500
How can the three major global consortia appear in person?

17
00:00:37.666 --> 00:00:39.500
Make fun of you didn't say

18
00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:40.566
Shen Yunwei's husband

19
00:00:40.566 --> 00:00:42.300
Just a trash picker?

20
00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.400
Get out of here, no wonder you hurry up with 7 sky lanterns

21
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.100
It turns out that there are three major consortia behind him who want it.

22
00:00:48.266 --> 00:00:49.700
3 trillion dollars

23
00:00:49.866 --> 00:00:51.700
Richer than the richest man in Warburg

24
00:00:51.866 --> 00:00:53.600
Who is Si Jingzhen?

25
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:54.400
Why even

26
00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.666
The three major financial groups in the world are so polite to him

27
00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:58.900
Xu Sheng is willing to admit defeat

28
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.433
Kowtow to me

29
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:02.666
When did I block you?

30
00:01:02.666 --> 00:01:04.066
Do you know whose place this is?

31
00:01:04.066 --> 00:01:05.366
This is Jiangyi's place

32
00:01:05.366 --> 00:01:06.333
Lao Tzu Nongsen Chair

33
00:01:06.333 --> 00:01:08.100
As simple as killing an ant

34
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.500
Looks like someone

35
00:01:09.933 --> 00:01:11.433
It's time for the venue.

36
00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:12.066
Yu Shao

37
00:01:12.066 --> 00:01:14.966
Since Mr. Si can afford to pay for seven lamps

38
00:01:14.966 --> 00:01:16.566
But you can't mess around here

39
00:01:16.566 --> 00:01:18.666
What are you?

40
00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:20.500
I can do whatever I want

41
00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.066
Somebody smash this for me
