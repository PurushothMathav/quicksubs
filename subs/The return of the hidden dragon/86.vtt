00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:01.433
How could this be?

2
00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:03.466
Did it count once?

3
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.100
Hahahaha Skinken

4
00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:06.466
Did you see it?

5
00:00:06.533 --> 00:00:08.466
The clouds in your country have dissipated

6
00:00:08.466 --> 00:00:11.833
Now obediently hand over my Western Medicine Royal National Treasure

7
00:00:11.866 --> 00:00:13.266
Otherwise

8
00:00:13.333 --> 00:00:16.200
I will bring my cavalry to level China

9
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.200
Bold you to burn that

10
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.066
William, you are not dead

11
00:00:43.066 --> 00:00:46.366
Delusional use of star luck magic to destroy my country's national luck

12
00:00:46.366 --> 00:00:49.200
I will die today by the sword of my declaration

13
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.833
sword thunder

14
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.866
Well, since you're courting death

15
00:00:56.966 --> 00:00:58.000
Give it to me

16
00:00:59.066 --> 00:00:59.866
up

17
00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:16.600
Lord War God

18
00:01:16.733 --> 00:01:17.766
Murderous growth

19
00:01:17.766 --> 00:01:19.000
The gas is weakened

20
00:01:19.166 --> 00:01:21.733
The atmosphere of China's expansion is declining

21
00:01:21.733 --> 00:01:23.266
To be exhausted

22
00:01:23.466 --> 00:01:25.566
I crossed the luck general

23
00:01:44.966 --> 00:01:47.500
Ah, how could that be?

24
00:01:47.733 --> 00:01:49.000
How could this be?

25
00:01:49.133 --> 00:01:50.100
irritating me

26
00:01:50.466 --> 00:01:52.000
Treasure of my fart

27
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.800
They'd row me through.

28
00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.966
Well, this is me crossing the treasure

29
00:01:56.533 --> 00:01:57.966
Steal it for you

30
00:01:57.966 --> 00:01:59.700
Thanks to the wise recapture of the previous emperor

31
00:01:59.733 --> 00:02:01.633
Although it was lost to the public a year ago

32
00:02:01.733 --> 00:02:03.100
But as of today

33
00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:05.766
I will never let the treasure live again
