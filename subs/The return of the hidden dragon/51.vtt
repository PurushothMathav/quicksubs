00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.766
How is this possible?

2
00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:12.133
How is that possible?

3
00:00:12.133 --> 00:00:15.366
Sun Juncai, do you think you have been in casinos for decades?

4
00:00:15.366 --> 00:00:18.300
Have you seen this situation today?

5
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.666
I advise you not to be too arrogant

6
00:00:20.733 --> 00:00:22.166
He's so good

7
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.766
It must be my favorite brother Ares

8
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.166
Police! You scared me to death!

9
00:00:27.166 --> 00:00:28.566
Didn't I say that?

10
00:00:28.566 --> 00:00:29.700
Just feel at ease

11
00:00:29.766 --> 00:00:31.133
Ok stop gambling

12
00:00:31.133 --> 00:00:32.166
business matters

13
00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:34.900
Sun Juncai, let me ask you

14
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.600
It shows that there is a problem with the pharmaceutical company.

15
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.800
Is it your fault? Examine

16
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:40.833
Oh.

17
00:00:40.933 --> 00:00:43.700
It turned out that Mr. Lin asked me to deal with a small gourd

18
00:00:43.933 --> 00:00:45.200
It's you two

19
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.266
I'm still worried that I can't find you

20
00:00:47.266 --> 00:00:49.166
Yes, I made it.

21
00:00:49.166 --> 00:00:51.100
How are you unconvinced?

22
00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:52.233
Cross bleeding drug

23
00:00:52.466 --> 00:00:54.300
I'm looking for you

24
00:00:54.666 --> 00:00:56.166
You have a big breath

25
00:00:56.166 --> 00:00:58.133
Behind me is Mr. Lin

26
00:00:58.133 --> 00:00:59.600
What kind of onion are you?

27
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.200
Can't we discuss it?

28
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.966
Then the game continues

29
00:01:03.733 --> 00:01:04.666
It's your turn.
