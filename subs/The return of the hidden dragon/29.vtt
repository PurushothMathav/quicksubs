1
00:00:01.366 --> 00:00:02.900
Did you see the waste?

2
00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:05.300
Just rely on you to pick up the junk of your life

3
00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:07.133
I'm afraid I can't pick up ten million

4
00:00:07.133 --> 00:00:07.933
Humph

5
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:10.666
Do you see the glazed seven-star lamp?

6
00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:12.266
What if you were really capable?

7
00:00:12.266 --> 00:00:13.333
Go up and order him

8
00:00:13.333 --> 00:00:14.900
Since Xu Shou wants to see it so much

9
00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:17.566
Then I will fulfill you

10
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:20.100
I'd like to see how you die, you trash

11
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.866
Jin Chen, don't be impulsive

12
00:00:21.866 --> 00:00:23.333
Do you know the consequences of pawning?

13
00:00:23.333 --> 00:00:24.866
Hotel glazing actor

14
00:00:24.866 --> 00:00:27.433
All the treasures in the audience are automatically ticketed

15
00:00:27.533 --> 00:00:28.633
Uncapped

16
00:00:28.733 --> 00:00:31.766
I know you can rest assured that I'm fine.

17
00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:34.100
What are you doing?

18
00:00:34.733 --> 00:00:35.766
Lighting

19
00:00:37.366 --> 00:00:38.666
What are you doing?

20
00:00:38.766 --> 00:00:40.500
You're not going to do that?

21
00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:41.300
host

22
00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.900
I suspect this person seriously disturbed the order of the venue

23
00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:45.933
I suggest kicking it out

24
00:00:45.933 --> 00:00:48.600
How dare he light a lamp?

25
00:00:48.966 --> 00:00:51.166
Are you crazy?

26
00:00:51.333 --> 00:00:52.600
How much is everything here?

27
00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:53.966
Don't you have a point in mind?

28
00:00:53.966 --> 00:00:54.900
This gentleman

29
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.100
Are you sure you want a light?

30
00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.066
Lighting means that the entire collection is yours.

31
00:00:59.066 --> 00:01:00.666
Double the price

32
00:01:00.666 --> 00:01:01.533
And so on.

33
00:01:01.533 --> 00:01:03.166
Order up to 7

34
00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:06.266
If you deliberately make trouble or are unable to pay

35
00:01:06.666 --> 00:01:09.100
Temporary in public according to the rules

36
00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.000
Some people can't stop them if they want to die

37
00:01:14.066 --> 00:01:17.033
This frog died and I asked for two.
