00:00:00.966 --> 00:00:04.100
Hey, hey, you stinky trash picker

2
00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:05.766
Can you come in?

3
00:00:05.766 --> 00:00:07.066
I have an appointment here

4
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.700
Got an appointment here

5
00:00:08.866 --> 00:00:10.466
Do you know what this place is?

6
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.400
Junhe Hotel

7
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.800
This is a seven-star hotel in the chemical industry.

8
00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:17.400
People who come in and out of here are either rich or expensive

9
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.300
Just you too

10
00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.466
How to be a small security guard?

11
00:00:22.566 --> 00:00:25.500
That gave you a sense of superiority.

12
00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:27.066
Go go go go go

13
00:00:27.066 --> 00:00:28.400
I'll tell you what.

14
00:00:28.466 --> 00:00:30.366
I've seen a lot of people like you

15
00:00:30.366 --> 00:00:33.000
Delusions climb to wealth by meeting big people

16
00:00:33.333 --> 00:00:34.833
Bah ah ah ah

17
00:00:34.966 --> 00:00:36.566
What is this army arguing about?

18
00:00:36.566 --> 00:00:37.900
Disturbing the closeness of nobles

19
00:00:38.666 --> 00:00:40.900
I just woke up and you gave me a lottery name, two sons.

20
00:00:41.266 --> 00:00:42.433
Make trouble here

21
00:00:43.533 --> 00:00:45.166
Hurry up and kick people out of me

22
00:00:45.166 --> 00:00:47.300
It also affected the recruitment of distinguished guests on the old night

23
00:00:47.466 --> 00:00:50.100
It's me who invited you on a good Sunday night.

24
00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:51.866
Ha ha.

25
00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.833
You are the one who recruits the elderly to go to bed

26
00:00:55.266 --> 00:00:55.900
What's up?

27
00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:57.766
Mr. Zhao wants to talk to you about collecting junk business?

28
00:00:57.766 --> 00:00:59.433
Go away boy

29
00:00:59.566 --> 00:01:02.333
I'll see you later, you'll give you good fruit to eat?

30
00:01:02.333 --> 00:01:04.000
Sunday and he can see me

31
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:05.600
That's his pleasure.

32
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.000
Boy, you are dreaming of eating people

33
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.600
I think you have a risk certificate, right?

34
00:01:09.666 --> 00:01:11.566
Hurry up and kick him out of me

35
00:01:11.766 --> 00:01:13.466
Go go roll roll roll roll

36
00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:21.966
Has my distinguished guest arrived?

37
00:01:21.966 --> 00:01:23.233
Here we are. Here we are.

38
00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:25.500
The Xu family's engagement party is waiting for you

39
00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:26.700
I'll show you the way.

40
00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:27.633
What engagement party?

41
00:01:29.066 --> 00:01:30.900
Then you are

42
00:01:31.366 --> 00:01:33.000
He's here to pick me up.

43
00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.100
Get out now

44
00:01:36.166 --> 00:01:38.433
How can you talk to Mr. Si?
