1
00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:01.366
Then I'd like to see it

2
00:00:01.366 --> 00:00:04.500
Who will be killed when the Night City Lord arrives?

3
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:05.800
You rubbish

4
00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:07.666
Then let you carry it for a while

5
00:00:07.666 --> 00:00:10.733
You'll know when you die

6
00:00:10.733 --> 00:00:12.000
I can see him.

7
00:00:12.266 --> 00:00:13.666
It's his pleasure.

8
00:00:14.733 --> 00:00:16.433
Stop talking nonsense with him

9
00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.533
The waste will arrive in 10 minutes

10
00:00:19.533 --> 00:00:20.666
What about the owner of Night City?

11
00:00:20.666 --> 00:00:22.366
Night City Main Road

12
00:00:32.533 --> 00:00:35.033
Mr. Sun, I have delivered your heart of the ocean to you.

13
00:00:39.066 --> 00:00:41.833
This is the true heart of the ocean

14
00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.133
So what?

15
00:00:44.133 --> 00:00:46.633
Why do you say mine is fake?

16
00:00:46.966 --> 00:00:48.000
well known

17
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.366
There is only one string of ocean hearts

18
00:00:49.366 --> 00:00:51.533
Then you mean my Sichuan is fake.

19
00:00:51.533 --> 00:00:54.200
No, no, no, Lord City Lord, listen to my explanation

20
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:55.933
The Xu family can't wait, right?

21
00:00:55.933 --> 00:00:57.000
I beg you

22
00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:58.600
Please forgive me

23
00:00:58.600 --> 00:00:59.900
Offended Mr. S

24
00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:01.166
You want me to spare you?

25
00:01:01.166 --> 00:01:04.366
Xu Zheng, what else do you have to say now?

26
00:01:04.366 --> 00:01:06.100
Even if this one of yours is real

27
00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:07.866
Such a precious heart of the ocean

28
00:01:07.866 --> 00:01:09.900
How can you, a poor man, afford it?

29
00:01:10.133 --> 00:01:10.933
naive

30
00:01:11.333 --> 00:01:12.866
How much is this?
