00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:02.266
Mr. Li

2
00:00:02.266 --> 00:00:04.400
You must avenge me, Mr. Li

3
00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:08.566
Useless waste

4
00:00:08.866 --> 00:00:11.766
I don't raise idle people, Mr. Li

5
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.433
Please give me another chance

6
00:00:13.466 --> 00:00:15.900
Mr. Li, please give me another chance.

7
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.266
Now listen up.

8
00:00:17.266 --> 00:00:19.100
I'll give you one last chance.

9
00:00:19.266 --> 00:00:20.833
Their wedding reception in two days

10
00:00:21.966 --> 00:00:25.400
And deliver it to them personally.

11
00:00:26.366 --> 00:00:29.433
I'm going to make their wedding a funeral

12
00:00:30.466 --> 00:00:32.100
Yes roll

13
00:00:36.133 --> 00:00:40.400
Look good and prepare for the wedding on the 3rd.

14
00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.566
Hmm, but Jingchen, um

15
00:00:42.566 --> 00:00:44.733
If we don't invite my parents to get married

16
00:00:44.733 --> 00:00:46.500
If it gets out, you will be laughed at.

17
00:00:47.966 --> 00:00:49.100
Then you tell them

18
00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.800
There will be a lot of big names at our wedding

19
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.733
Your parents want to make friends so much

20
00:00:53.733 --> 00:00:55.566
I know this news will come

21
00:00:55.566 --> 00:00:58.600
Is our wedding back big shot? Of course?

22
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.333
Hello mom in three days

23
00:01:05.333 --> 00:01:07.800
Jinchen Club and I will hold a wedding reception in the wedding chapel

24
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.066
There will be a lot of powerful people coming

25
00:01:10.066 --> 00:01:12.066
If you want to meet

26
00:01:12.266 --> 00:01:13.266
You can come.

27
00:01:13.466 --> 00:01:15.566
Got it.

28
00:01:15.766 --> 00:01:18.933
What's the matter, Yunwei is going to marry Si Jincheng

29
00:01:18.933 --> 00:01:22.533
It's about making friends at weddings.

30
00:01:22.533 --> 00:01:24.200
Ouch

31
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.566
You said that a person like Mr. Zhou

32
00:01:26.566 --> 00:01:29.200
Nod and bow to this kid

33
00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.700
Maybe this kid is really capable?

34
00:01:33.533 --> 00:01:36.500
When did you say three days later?

35
00:01:37.566 --> 00:01:40.400
Okay, let's take a look then.
