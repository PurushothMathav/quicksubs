1
00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:04.766
How could he

2
00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:06.466
It was you

3
00:00:06.466 --> 00:00:07.766
Don't you know yet?

4
00:00:07.766 --> 00:00:09.000
This person is Dong Fansheng

5
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.466
The mistress who is raising outside

6
00:00:10.466 --> 00:00:12.300
Okay, you Dong Fansheng

7
00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:15.133
You dare to take the flying swallow as your mistress's dance

8
00:00:15.133 --> 00:00:15.966
Platform

9
00:00:16.066 --> 00:00:19.200
You really didn't take Miss Shangguan seriously?

10
00:00:19.566 --> 00:00:20.566
You wait for me.

11
00:00:20.566 --> 00:00:22.166
If you see Miss Shangguan today

12
00:00:22.166 --> 00:00:23.500
I'll sue you hard

13
00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:25.366
So it's a mistress?

14
00:00:25.733 --> 00:00:28.200
Dong Fansheng also dares to bring it to this occasion

15
00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:30.233
I really don't know what to do.

16
00:00:30.266 --> 00:00:31.866
A pheasant is a pheasant

17
00:00:31.866 --> 00:00:33.600
Don't think you're wearing bright clothes

18
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.333
You can fly to the branches and become a phoenix

19
00:00:35.333 --> 00:00:36.966
Is it just you?

20
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.566
Less here, more people

21
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.166
How dare you hit me?

22
00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:44.500
Qian Shao, this is a flying flower banquet held by the Shangguan family

23
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.733
He didn't take the Shangguan family seriously at all

24
00:00:46.733 --> 00:00:48.000
Enough, Mr. Qing

25
00:00:48.666 --> 00:00:50.300
You really don't care about the Shangguan family

26
00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.633
With Miss Shangguan in your eyes?

27
00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:54.066
Nonsense

28
00:00:54.366 --> 00:00:55.100
Dong Fansheng

29
00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.466
Just teach him some principles of life

30
00:00:57.966 --> 00:00:59.466
What did the Shangguan family do?

31
00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.866
You're not going to let him tell you what to do.

32
00:01:01.866 --> 00:01:04.366
I think your tail was stepped on. Are you in a hurry?

33
00:01:04.466 --> 00:01:06.566
Fear of being exposed

34
00:01:06.566 --> 00:01:09.066
Dynamically, I'm really curious.

35
00:01:09.733 --> 00:01:12.400
What's so good about this fight?

36
00:01:12.533 --> 00:01:14.666
Let you go against me again and again
