00:00:07.666 --> 00:00:08.700
Miss Shangguan

2
00:00:09.166 --> 00:00:10.900
Are you sure you won't regret it?

3
00:00:10.966 --> 00:00:12.800
I can trust my grandfather's vision

4
00:00:13.566 --> 00:00:14.566
Come on.

5
00:00:18.166 --> 00:00:19.233
Who is that?

6
00:00:19.566 --> 00:00:20.500
Never seen

7
00:00:20.733 --> 00:00:22.700
He doesn't seem to be in our circle.

8
00:00:22.766 --> 00:00:26.100
It's too casual to dress like this at the fat feast

9
00:00:26.133 --> 00:00:29.000
Could it be that he is a prominent son of some family in the imperial capital?

10
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.733
Deliberately low-key appearance

11
00:00:30.733 --> 00:00:32.633
What a shit boy

12
00:00:32.733 --> 00:00:34.866
He is a migrant worker who moves bricks on the construction site

13
00:00:36.266 --> 00:00:38.266
This person is my ex-husband

14
00:00:38.333 --> 00:00:40.966
I don't know which rich woman he has fallen in love with recently.

15
00:00:40.966 --> 00:00:43.200
He was in a hurry to divorce me

16
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.533
true or false?

17
00:00:44.533 --> 00:00:45.833
Such a disgusting person

18
00:00:46.266 --> 00:00:49.700
There is such a person at the flying flower banquet, of course not

19
00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.700
So I suspect he broke in to steal something

20
00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:55.800
After all, everyone here is either rich or expensive

21
00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:59.366
Who would bring a mistress to meet Miss Shangguan?

22
00:00:59.366 --> 00:01:00.600
Who dares?

23
00:01:00.666 --> 00:01:02.833
The woman behind him can't even get in

24
00:01:03.266 --> 00:01:04.100
I think

25
00:01:04.566 --> 00:01:06.866
Did he come through that dog hole?

26
00:01:06.866 --> 00:01:09.333
Hahaha, what happened?

27
00:01:09.333 --> 00:01:11.066
Uncle Wang, why are you here?

28
00:01:12.266 --> 00:01:14.466
I'll be in charge of the reception

29
00:01:15.066 --> 00:01:17.233
You must serve Miss Shangguan well

30
00:01:17.533 --> 00:01:19.866
I'm really going to visit Miss Shangguan

31
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.833
What are you guys doing all this noise?

32
00:01:23.266 --> 00:01:24.633
Disturb Miss Shangguan

33
00:01:24.966 --> 00:01:25.900
How is good?

34
00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:27.566
Uncle Wang, listen to me

35
00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.500
I suspect this kid is sneaking around

36
00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.800
To make trouble at this flying flower feast

37
00:01:34.666 --> 00:01:36.966
What about your invitation, sir?

38
00:01:37.066 --> 00:01:38.066
I don't have an invitation
