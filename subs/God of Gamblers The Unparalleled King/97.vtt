00:00:00.666 --> 00:00:01.600
Yo

2
00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:04.400
He turned out to be a woman from heaven

3
00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.066
No wonder Lord Qin chose the official family

4
00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:13.200
It seems that Sissi and the official family have a bright future.

5
00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:17.466
Fortunately, we have already taken refuge in the official family

6
00:00:17.766 --> 00:00:21.500
Today, after Lord Qianshang announced his marriage with the official family

7
00:00:22.133 --> 00:00:24.566
I don't know how many people want to cling to the official family

8
00:00:24.566 --> 00:00:26.100
Still can't cling

9
00:00:27.066 --> 00:00:30.366
Miss Guan, I am willing to take my sister to marry into the Guan family

10
00:00:30.666 --> 00:00:32.366
You have served her all your life

11
00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:36.033
Haha, you are much smarter than your sister.

12
00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:37.100
OK

13
00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:41.200
I promised you, Shangguan Yu is my sister-in-law

14
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:42.766
All of you.

15
00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:44.233
All witness

16
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:45.966
Shangguan Linglong

17
00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:47.966
You look like an elf

18
00:00:48.133 --> 00:00:49.866
Actually stupid

19
00:00:49.866 --> 00:00:52.800
You missed your last chance

20
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.000
I see what you have to be proud of

21
00:00:57.566 --> 00:01:00.733
Of course, watching you compete to jump into the pit

22
00:01:00.733 --> 00:01:01.966
Happy

23
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.266
It's you, our official didn't invite you

24
00:01:09.566 --> 00:01:12.133
Ye Feng, who let you in?

25
00:01:12.133 --> 00:01:13.833
Why don't you get out of here?

26
00:01:13.966 --> 00:01:16.400
You don't see what this place is

27
00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.000
You are not children of aristocratic families

28
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.866
A rising star

29
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.100
Is that also the place where you, a migrant worker, came in?

30
00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:26.966
What happened to the migrant workers?

31
00:01:27.266 --> 00:01:29.266
I earn money from my own physical strength

32
00:01:29.266 --> 00:01:31.500
Upright and innocent

33
00:01:31.866 --> 00:01:35.200
What's better than you betraying your granddaughter's family?

34
00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.766
And you Guan Qianqian

35
00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.266
I had no idea.

36
00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:43.400
When is it your turn to decide the triumph banquet?
