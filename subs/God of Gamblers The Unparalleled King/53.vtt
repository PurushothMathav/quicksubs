00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:03.466
Ouch, how can this be good?

2
00:00:03.466 --> 00:00:05.366
It's not because of that night wind

3
00:00:05.366 --> 00:00:06.733
If not for him

4
00:00:06.733 --> 00:00:09.433
How could our Shangguan family have fallen to such a state?

5
00:00:09.933 --> 00:00:12.400
It's all that wild bee and Shangguan Linglong's fault

6
00:00:12.533 --> 00:00:13.800
Turn your elbows out

7
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:15.666
They just left.

8
00:00:15.666 --> 00:00:17.466
It pitted our Shangguan family badly

9
00:00:17.466 --> 00:00:18.766
How can this be good?

10
00:00:18.766 --> 00:00:21.100
Hurry up and think of a way for me

11
00:00:21.533 --> 00:00:23.300
Hey but

12
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.366
Your Highness, the most important thing is

13
00:00:25.366 --> 00:00:28.800
Stop the marriage between that stinky girl and the wild bee first

14
00:00:29.966 --> 00:00:32.000
Wait until they are separated

15
00:00:32.066 --> 00:00:35.633
Then let Linglong go to Guo An's house to apologize

16
00:00:36.866 --> 00:00:40.433
There may be room for recovery, mom

17
00:00:40.933 --> 00:00:43.233
They are the marriage contract that Dad made before he died

18
00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:44.166
shut up

19
00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:45.900
That year is that year

20
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:48.000
Now is now hum

21
00:00:48.166 --> 00:00:51.000
Back then, our Shangguan family had a great career

22
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.266
You don't have to look at other people's faces.

23
00:00:53.333 --> 00:00:56.800
It's not because of you losers yet

24
00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.300
Useless

25
00:00:59.133 --> 00:01:01.033
One moment at a time

26
00:01:02.866 --> 00:01:05.700
We lost the official family

27
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.266
How long can the Shangguan family last?

28
00:01:09.733 --> 00:01:13.400
Everything must be based on the family's overall interests

29
00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.700
Dick, listen to me

30
00:01:16.866 --> 00:01:19.600
I don't care what you two do

31
00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.833
Hurry up and solve this matter for me

32
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.366
I don't want to see Ye Feng jumping in front of me again

33
00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.800
If you two can't solve it, get out of the Shangguan room

34
00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:32.700
Linglong

35
00:01:33.133 --> 00:01:34.200
What are you thinking?

36
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.700
I still don't know how to save you, Ye Feng

37
00:01:37.733 --> 00:01:39.300
Or humble sir

38
00:01:39.533 --> 00:01:42.500
There is nothing between you and me, my lord

39
00:01:42.666 --> 00:01:43.566
Only Ye Feng

40
00:01:45.466 --> 00:01:46.100
Ye Feng

41
00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.800
I still think none of this is real

42
00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.900
Is your identity real?

43
00:01:53.933 --> 00:01:55.266
What's real?
