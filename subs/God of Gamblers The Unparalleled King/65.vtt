1
00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:05.466
As expected of the Fubin Hotel

2
00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:08.033
The private room on the second floor is not ordinary.

3
00:00:08.733 --> 00:00:09.933
The service of the king

4
00:00:09.933 --> 00:00:12.466
We have eaten in a hotel of this class

5
00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:15.833
Just sitting in this kind of private room is a pleasure

6
00:00:15.966 --> 00:00:17.700
Hey, what's this?

7
00:00:17.733 --> 00:00:19.000
Compared to accidents

8
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.800
This grade is also average.

9
00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:22.300
Wang Yalei

10
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.366
Why haven't I seen you in years? You talk like a foreigner.

11
00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.100
You're right about that.

12
00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:28.366
Don't you know?

13
00:00:28.466 --> 00:00:31.066
Brother Wang joined the foreigners several years ago

14
00:00:31.066 --> 00:00:34.200
Now a justifiable foreign VIP

15
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.766
Gee, that was years ago.

16
00:00:38.466 --> 00:00:39.666
Is there any Yin Saying Liquid?

17
00:00:39.933 --> 00:00:41.466
Compared to elephants

18
00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45.366
An unexpected life is high class.

19
00:00:45.866 --> 00:00:47.233
To say so

20
00:00:47.366 --> 00:00:49.800
There is more moon outside than buildings

21
00:00:50.733 --> 00:00:51.600
This little brother

22
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.766
You sound a little unconvinced.

23
00:00:53.933 --> 00:00:55.200
But it doesn't matter.

24
00:00:55.266 --> 00:00:56.400
I can also understand

25
00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.600
After all, some people have never been on a plane in their lives

26
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.666
Not to mention traveling abroad

27
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.166
Wait for your chance.

28
00:01:03.166 --> 00:01:05.466
You save some money to travel outside the fish

29
00:01:05.666 --> 00:01:06.500
Go have a look.

30
00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.466
See it and you'll know

31
00:01:09.533 --> 00:01:11.166
Look at my dress

32
00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:12.666
Just this material

33
00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:15.800
No company in Daxia can do it

34
00:01:16.133 --> 00:01:17.366
According to you

35
00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.400
This is what the Daxia designer told you personally.

36
00:01:20.966 --> 00:01:23.833
Or is your narrow vision telling you

37
00:01:24.133 --> 00:01:25.133
How old are you?

38
00:01:25.133 --> 00:01:26.466
Dare to talk to Brother Wang like that

39
00:01:26.466 --> 00:01:27.866
I don't like to hear you say that

40
00:01:27.866 --> 00:01:29.633
That is, that is, that is.

41
00:01:29.933 --> 00:01:31.800
Don't be familiar with such people

42
00:01:32.366 --> 00:01:35.066
After all, living in such a small place

43
00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.366
He must be jealous

44
00:01:37.466 --> 00:01:39.300
Those who were superior in your mouth back then

45
00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:40.500
Of expatriates

46
00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.833
What we call mansion citizenship

47
00:01:43.166 --> 00:01:44.800
But very envious
