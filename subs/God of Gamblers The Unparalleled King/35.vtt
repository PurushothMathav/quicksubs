00:00:02.566 --> 00:00:04.666
This wine is strong but not strong

2
00:00:04.666 --> 00:00:06.266
Soft and long

3
00:00:06.333 --> 00:00:09.500
What wine does this taste like?

4
00:00:10.333 --> 00:00:11.800
So

5
00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.233
Such a precious antique red sandalwood box

6
00:00:14.566 --> 00:00:16.833
It's just a wine container

7
00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:18.400
Is this

8
00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:22.700
Ye Feng, don't think you can get a imitation and pack some wine.

9
00:00:22.866 --> 00:00:24.600
You can get away with it

10
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:26.666
True or False

11
00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:28.566
You know it.

12
00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.266
If it is fake

13
00:00:30.533 --> 00:00:33.600
How could the old man be fascinated for so long?

14
00:00:33.933 --> 00:00:34.400
Ah!

15
00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:38.933
That's because your imitations are too realistic.

16
00:00:38.933 --> 00:00:40.566
I just took a few more glances.

17
00:00:41.366 --> 00:00:44.100
Really?

18
00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.566
Old Madam, do you think I have no connections?

19
00:00:47.866 --> 00:00:49.233
No background

20
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.666
Even if you occasionally get a genuine one or two

21
00:00:53.733 --> 00:00:55.800
Can't compete with officials

22
00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:58.500
Old Taijun

23
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.666
You really thought about it

24
00:01:00.866 --> 00:01:04.900
If it weren't for the upper joint, which is invisible

25
00:01:05.966 --> 00:01:07.833
Broke my wine

26
00:01:08.133 --> 00:01:10.366
What a pity he is, my bottle of wine

27
00:01:10.366 --> 00:01:12.800
What a poor, sharp mouth

28
00:01:13.066 --> 00:01:16.033
What about the wooden box of antique rosewood?

29
00:01:16.266 --> 00:01:18.400
It's such a small bottle of wine

30
00:01:18.533 --> 00:01:21.066
Do you think this is a rural feast?

31
00:01:21.266 --> 00:01:23.766
Just hit two taels of loose wine and recharge it.

32
00:01:24.866 --> 00:01:28.433
I'm afraid you've never drunk Maotai wine before.

33
00:01:28.766 --> 00:01:30.766
I don't even know your wine

34
00:01:30.766 --> 00:01:33.966
Nothing compares to the custom wine on this table

35
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:34.800
Ye Feng

36
00:01:35.266 --> 00:01:37.300
I advise you before you brag next time

37
00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:38.866
Check the information online first

38
00:01:38.866 --> 00:01:40.033
draft

39
00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.233
So as not to be found out

40
00:01:42.966 --> 00:01:44.300
ridicule

41
00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:45.966
This is the first time I've seen you.

42
00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.366
I am afraid that custom Sendai will be compared with glory Sendai.

43
00:01:52.366 --> 00:01:54.366
Poor people talk big.

44
00:01:54.533 --> 00:01:57.866
I really take this mouthful of horse urine as a good thing

45
00:01:58.366 --> 00:01:59.866
As long as you get out

46
00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:02.266
What if I go to the official's house to accompany you for a truck?

47
00:02:03.333 --> 00:02:05.100
What kind of wine do you say this is?

48
00:02:05.733 --> 00:02:08.700
This is Glory Sendai
