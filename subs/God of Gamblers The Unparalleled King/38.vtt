00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:02.400
Yes, Qianqian, how do you know it's fake?

2
00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:06.200
Didn't someone just say that someone 8.80 million

3
00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.033
Do you get this review?

4
00:00:08.166 --> 00:00:10.166
I just want to ask everyone here

5
00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.700
This wine is priceless

6
00:00:12.766 --> 00:00:14.766
It's not unattainable, is it?

7
00:00:14.966 --> 00:00:16.500
Think about it.

8
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:17.966
With your assets

9
00:00:18.066 --> 00:00:21.000
You can also taste it if you want.

10
00:00:21.266 --> 00:00:23.200
But think about it.

11
00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.766
Why is this wine no longer in circulation on the market?

12
00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:31.433
Which noble family lost interest in this wine?

13
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.966
Or is there another wine instead?

14
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.766
Yeah, 10 years ago.

15
00:00:37.766 --> 00:00:39.900
The market for this wine drama has disappeared

16
00:00:40.733 --> 00:00:43.766
The aristocratic family would never suddenly lose interest in him

17
00:00:44.166 --> 00:00:47.066
This is a rare treasure.

18
00:00:47.266 --> 00:00:48.866
This is the supreme wine in the world

19
00:00:48.866 --> 00:00:51.233
It can never be replaced by any other wine

20
00:00:51.533 --> 00:00:55.433
I hope Miss Guan can answer one or two reasons for this.

21
00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:56.733
How about this?

22
00:00:56.733 --> 00:00:59.300
You don't know

23
00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.466
This wine went out of circulation ten years ago

24
00:01:02.733 --> 00:01:05.400
Because heaven regards him as a national treasure

25
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.666
Close and corrupt officials

26
00:01:06.666 --> 00:01:09.500
From now on, it will not be circulated on the market.

27
00:01:10.066 --> 00:01:12.600
Oh, I see.

28
00:01:12.733 --> 00:01:15.700
So this bottle of wine he sent

29
00:01:16.733 --> 00:01:19.800
This is thanks to Miss Guan who exposed this person's trick

30
00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:21.933
Oops otherwise

31
00:01:21.933 --> 00:01:25.100
Today, our Shangguan family will be deceived by him

32
00:01:25.933 --> 00:01:26.733
Ye Feng

33
00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.500
Is what he said true? Don't worry.

34
00:01:30.333 --> 00:01:31.466
Miss Guan

35
00:01:31.533 --> 00:01:34.333
Are you sure this wine will be sealed from the world from now on?

36
00:01:34.333 --> 00:01:36.000
Is it no longer here?
