00:00:00.866 --> 00:00:03.800
It's been more than ten years, and you're still pretending?

2
00:00:04.066 --> 00:00:07.000
The whole class knows that you like me

3
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.700
But it's not your fault.

4
00:00:10.733 --> 00:00:12.766
Who made me beautiful?

5
00:00:14.733 --> 00:00:17.566
You are just one of my many pursuers

6
00:00:18.133 --> 00:00:19.466
It's all so big

7
00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:21.400
I won't say it

8
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.400
Oh, you're here to visit, right?

9
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.366
The mall is ahead

10
00:00:27.466 --> 00:00:28.900
This is the office area.

11
00:00:29.666 --> 00:00:31.200
If you want to visit

12
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.066
I've found the right person

13
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.500
I am now a staff member of Star and Moon Fairy Tales

14
00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.000
You can ask me if you want to know anything.

15
00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:44.266
I don't mind introducing you when I'm free

16
00:00:44.266 --> 00:00:46.600
Little by little

17
00:00:46.733 --> 00:00:48.066
You work here?

18
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.233
You heard right

19
00:00:51.766 --> 00:00:54.866
I am now a regular employee of Star Moon Fairy Tale

20
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.200
This is a golden rice bowl

21
00:00:58.533 --> 00:01:01.566
If you come with the intention of hugging me

22
00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:03.966
I suggest you get rid of this idea

23
00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.833
My boyfriend is the manager of the purchasing account.

24
00:01:08.466 --> 00:01:10.033
If it weren't for this relationship

25
00:01:10.066 --> 00:01:12.233
Many people want to get in but can't get in

26
00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:14.566
As for you

27
00:01:15.466 --> 00:01:17.666
If it doesn't matter, forget it.

28
00:01:19.133 --> 00:01:21.166
This is not a cat or a dog

29
00:01:21.166 --> 00:01:23.033
A place where you can come to work

30
00:01:23.966 --> 00:01:27.100
So you work in global procurement

31
00:01:27.333 --> 00:01:29.100
You are not stupid

32
00:01:29.533 --> 00:01:31.533
My monthly salary 20,000

33
00:01:31.533 --> 00:01:33.000
There is a bonus at the end of the year

34
00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:36.566
I only need to come to the office clock in occasionally

35
00:01:36.666 --> 00:01:37.933
Don't do anything

36
00:01:37.933 --> 00:01:39.033
It's easy.

37
00:01:39.766 --> 00:01:42.700
But I remember you didn't go to college.

38
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.766
You haven't studied purchasing management.

39
00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:46.666
You work like this

40
00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.066
The company doesn't care

41
00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:50.633
There is my boyfriend

42
00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.366
Who would say anything about me?

43
00:01:53.133 --> 00:01:55.200
Anyway, I'm glad

44
00:01:55.266 --> 00:01:58.233
I didn't choose any of you in the first place

45
00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:00.666
Otherwise I'll miss my boyfriend

46
00:02:00.666 --> 00:02:02.500
Such a good man

47
00:02:03.066 --> 00:02:06.300
Oh, by the way, my boyfriend will pick me up later.

48
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.900
I will send you a kind heart to get to know you.

49
00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.366
By the way, I will show you the advanced level of Xingyue Fairy Tale

50
00:02:17.166 --> 00:02:18.600
Hey, dear.

51
00:02:19.166 --> 00:02:21.666
Are you tired of coming down to pick me up in person?

52
00:02:22.166 --> 00:02:24.766
Xingyue Fairy Tales' new luxury merchants

53
00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.566
Let's go shopping in a while, okay? We don't need to go.

54
00:02:27.566 --> 00:02:30.766
This is what they just honored me today.

55
00:02:30.766 --> 00:02:33.166
Well, husband, you are so kind.

56
00:02:33.166 --> 00:02:34.400
There are outsiders

57
00:02:34.933 --> 00:02:36.433
And this is...
