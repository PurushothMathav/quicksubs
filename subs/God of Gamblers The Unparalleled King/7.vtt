00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:02.000
Hey Tingting

2
00:00:02.533 --> 00:00:03.766
Look who that is

3
00:00:04.166 --> 00:00:05.600
Am I blind?

4
00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:07.800
Ye Feng, how did you know I was coming to participate?

5
00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.466
The high-end card game of Yongning Club

6
00:00:09.533 --> 00:00:11.200
Still dead and broken

7
00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:12.266
Are you so funny

8
00:00:12.266 --> 00:00:14.300
You don't have to play yourself like that

9
00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:15.366
Am I wrong?

10
00:00:15.366 --> 00:00:18.133
This Yongning Club is the most high-end cruise ship in Ningcheng

11
00:00:18.133 --> 00:00:19.866
This chip is tens of thousands

12
00:00:19.966 --> 00:00:21.866
It's a place where migrant workers like you who move bricks can afford to play

13
00:00:21.866 --> 00:00:23.833
I see he's just out of money

14
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.300
Waiting to mix up our leftovers

15
00:00:27.333 --> 00:00:28.666
I don't know

16
00:00:28.966 --> 00:00:30.366
Am I wrong?

17
00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:33.400
You can exchange your salary for the chips here.

18
00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:37.100
I think it is estimated that he stole something from your house and sold it.

19
00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.566
I barely managed to scrape together a ticket to visit

20
00:00:39.666 --> 00:00:42.166
Redeem a free chip

21
00:00:42.166 --> 00:00:43.566
Hahahaha

22
00:00:44.266 --> 00:00:46.466
Aren't you ashamed of that?

23
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.600
Look at the face of our Tingting

24
00:00:48.766 --> 00:00:51.566
You kneel down now and make me happy

25
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.566
I'll introduce you to a job

26
00:00:53.566 --> 00:00:55.666
Go to our previous life group to be a security guard

27
00:00:55.666 --> 00:00:56.800
2,000 a month.

28
00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.100
Are you satisfied? You are just too kind.

29
00:00:59.133 --> 00:01:00.300
Ye Feng, did you hear me?

30
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.933
Less money to give you a job

31
00:01:01.933 --> 00:01:03.133
Why don't you hurry up to Endade?

32
00:01:03.133 --> 00:01:04.633
Get under his crotch

33
00:01:05.133 --> 00:01:05.733
If I Were You

34
00:01:05.733 --> 00:01:08.000
I took this opportunity to kneel to him

35
00:01:08.533 --> 00:01:10.300
I'm afraid his life is too light

36
00:01:10.333 --> 00:01:12.700
I can't take it. I can't take it.

37
00:01:12.766 --> 00:01:14.366
You're out of the house now.

38
00:01:14.366 --> 00:01:15.666
You are nothing

39
00:01:15.933 --> 00:01:18.300
Why don't you take the opportunity to thank him?

40
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.966
I want to sprinkle it elsewhere

41
00:01:22.333 --> 00:01:24.100
I have served your father for the past three years

42
00:01:24.666 --> 00:01:27.500
It's already your father's life-saving grace

43
00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.500
Get out of here and watch me breathe

44
00:01:29.933 --> 00:01:33.166
Boy, I don't think you can tell the difference now

45
00:01:33.266 --> 00:01:35.066
In Ningcheng, as long as I say a word

46
00:01:35.066 --> 00:01:36.600
You can cut off your secondary corpse

47
00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.966
Let you lie under the bridge hole and never get out

48
00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.100
So now you kneel down and kowtow to Tingting and apologize

49
00:01:42.333 --> 00:01:44.133
I'll just break your feet

50
00:01:44.133 --> 00:01:45.500
Let you crawl to the hospital

51
00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.366
Really? You have so much ability
