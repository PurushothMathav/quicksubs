00:00:01.266 --> 00:00:02.266
Uncle Shangguan

2
00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:03.066
Please accept it with a smile.

3
00:00:03.066 --> 00:00:05.900
Okay, okay, you have a heart.

4
00:00:07.966 --> 00:00:09.266
Hey second brother

5
00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:11.133
Don't rush to put it away.

6
00:00:11.133 --> 00:00:13.566
Take it out for everyone to appreciate

7
00:00:13.566 --> 00:00:17.866
What rare thing did your good son-in-law give you?

8
00:00:17.866 --> 00:00:19.666
Ahahaha

9
00:00:19.666 --> 00:00:22.266
Oh, your big brother is right.

10
00:00:22.333 --> 00:00:26.833
The second brother takes out the gift for everyone to see

11
00:00:27.533 --> 00:00:29.266
My old lady

12
00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.233
I also want to know what kind of reason

13
00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.366
It is worthy of the honor of our Shangguan family

14
00:00:36.966 --> 00:00:38.166
coincidence

15
00:00:38.566 --> 00:00:40.200
Hit the muzzle

16
00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.833
You might get away with giving something away.

17
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.800
But you send such a rare item.

18
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:47.900
Ye Feng

19
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.366
I'm afraid you don't know

20
00:00:49.366 --> 00:00:52.100
Our old lady specializes in collecting.

21
00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.100
Ah, Shangguan Linglong

22
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.466
Grandma likes to collect these

23
00:00:56.566 --> 00:01:00.066
You and my father were also educated from an early age

24
00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.866
Your dad usually plays a lot of good things less, right?

25
00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.066
I'm afraid I've never seen such rubbish before

26
00:01:05.066 --> 00:01:07.366
An inferior person is an inferior person

27
00:01:07.366 --> 00:01:11.233
The first time you come to the door, you will give the old gentleman this broken thing?

28
00:01:11.666 --> 00:01:12.766
Shangguan Linglong

29
00:01:13.133 --> 00:01:15.766
I suggest you listen more to your elders

30
00:01:15.766 --> 00:01:17.400
So as not to make a fool of yourself in public

31
00:01:18.766 --> 00:01:21.300
I read that right?

32
00:01:22.133 --> 00:01:24.300
What's wrong? Is there anything wrong?

33
00:01:25.933 --> 00:01:27.300
This is a treasure of faith

34
00:01:27.533 --> 00:01:28.966
Unparalleled in history
