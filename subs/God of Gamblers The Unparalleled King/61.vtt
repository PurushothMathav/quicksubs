1
00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.033
Did that Davis just get scared by you?

2
00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:06.666
Why not?

3
00:00:06.666 --> 00:00:08.566
You are a stand-in for humble after all

4
00:00:08.766 --> 00:00:11.100
It may look somewhat similar to Qianshang

5
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:12.666
It's not surprising that he admitted his mistake

6
00:00:13.533 --> 00:00:14.700
So it seems

7
00:00:15.566 --> 00:00:17.066
Your husband's face

8
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:18.800
Still useful

9
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:21.700
You are so immodest

10
00:00:22.266 --> 00:00:25.000
Although it was a misunderstanding that got Davis to sign the contract

11
00:00:25.266 --> 00:00:26.800
But the liquidated damages are so high

12
00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.233
Even if he knew later, he wouldn't regret it

13
00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:33.866
But I'm afraid he'll do something bad behind his back later

14
00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:35.766
There's going to be a problem.

15
00:00:35.766 --> 00:00:37.033
Daughter-in-law is right

16
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.333
I happen to have a few classmates

17
00:00:39.333 --> 00:00:41.600
Do overseas channels in Weili International

18
00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:43.966
They came back from a business trip.

19
00:00:43.966 --> 00:00:46.133
The students are getting ready at the Fubin Hotel

20
00:00:46.133 --> 00:00:47.500
Give them a clean slate

21
00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.366
Then you can go with me.

22
00:00:49.366 --> 00:00:51.933
Even if you help us pass on a message, it's good

23
00:00:51.933 --> 00:00:53.700
Ok, it's up to you.

24
00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.266
What Davis is dead

25
00:00:58.266 --> 00:00:59.366
Dare to attack the official

26
00:00:59.366 --> 00:01:01.633
Doesn't he know who is behind the official family?

27
00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.600
Sir, I just got the message

28
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.833
Not necessarily Wuji signed a cooperation with the Shangguan family

29
00:01:11.866 --> 00:01:14.333
You don't think it's urgent

30
00:01:14.333 --> 00:01:16.500
I will deal with it after the triumphal banquet

31
00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.400
They have a priority now

32
00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.333
To raise 10 billion dollars for me

33
00:01:20.333 --> 00:01:21.500
I need it urgently.

34
00:01:23.133 --> 00:01:23.866
Sir?

35
00:01:23.866 --> 00:01:26.400
The current liquidity available on the official books

36
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.766
There aren't many left.

37
00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:30.600
I thought you had a project.

38
00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.500
What is it called a new moon fairy tale?

39
00:01:33.766 --> 00:01:35.800
The Star-Moon Fairy Tale project has made more progress

40
00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.233
Now on to the finishing touches.

41
00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:38.666
That's the old man of Shangguan's family

42
00:01:38.666 --> 00:01:40.066
Dowry for Shangguan Linglong

43
00:01:40.066 --> 00:01:41.700
Jade pot revenue 20 billion dollars

44
00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:44.900
Killing chickens to keep warm

45
00:01:45.166 --> 00:01:47.600
I'm afraid it's not a good deal.

46
00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.300
Estimated earnings 20 billion

47
00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:51.433
Buying 10 billion is not a problem

48
00:01:53.333 --> 00:01:55.266
The heat of the sky

49
00:01:55.733 --> 00:01:58.933
Don't forget that you Sister Guan got up by relying on water

50
00:01:58.933 --> 00:02:01.600
Brother, what do you use?

51
00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.000
Anyway, the new fairy tale project

52
00:02:04.066 --> 00:02:05.900
It is also the official family in the name of Lianying

53
00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:08.000
Snatched from Shangguan Linglong

54
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.866
It costs nothing at all.

55
00:02:09.966 --> 00:02:11.400
You don't think about it either

56
00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.900
So many people ask for help

57
00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.400
There's no way yet.

58
00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:16.700
Or are you sweet?

59
00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.133
Unlike your big brother

60
00:02:18.133 --> 00:02:19.700
It is said that the front is not married

61
00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.633
Is he my big brother after all?

62
00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.000
But the person on your shoulder is already your woman

63
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.500
When will you give people a name?

64
00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.400
I've been sentenced for a long time

65
00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:30.500
When I get this done

66
00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.133
I will announce to the world at the seafood feast

67
00:02:33.133 --> 00:02:35.966
Is my woman I love you

68
00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:38.966
Great bro

69
00:02:38.966 --> 00:02:40.400
What does the Lord in Heaven ask you to do?

70
00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:41.800
Just do it

71
00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:43.066
With his power

72
00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:45.200
Then he will become the son-in-law of the official family

73
00:02:45.333 --> 00:02:47.833
It's still a little money from our official family, isn't it?

74
00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.466
OK, I'll do it now.
