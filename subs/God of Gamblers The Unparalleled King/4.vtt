00:00:11.733 --> 00:00:13.500
Ah night wind

2
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:14.966
What are you doing?

3
00:00:15.766 --> 00:00:17.666
Ji Tie, is this your husband?

4
00:00:17.666 --> 00:00:18.866
He is only in name

5
00:00:18.866 --> 00:00:20.333
I never let him touch me

6
00:00:20.333 --> 00:00:21.500
Why are you here?

7
00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:22.566
Why am I here?

8
00:00:22.766 --> 00:00:24.066
This is my home.

9
00:00:24.133 --> 00:00:25.200
Where can I be?

10
00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:26.733
He who he who

11
00:00:26.733 --> 00:00:28.833
Let go, he's my boyfriend

12
00:00:28.933 --> 00:00:32.266
Night Wind, the young owner of Famous City Real Estate, right?

13
00:00:32.366 --> 00:00:34.700
He drinks a lot, he's your boyfriend

14
00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:35.700
And who am I?

15
00:00:35.766 --> 00:00:37.500
We are husband and wife

16
00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:39.900
If you don't pee, look at yourself

17
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.733
If my father hadn't forced me to marry you before he died

18
00:00:42.733 --> 00:00:44.466
How could I possibly marry a brick mover?

19
00:00:44.466 --> 00:00:46.966
Meritorious service, what did you say? Did I say it wrong?

20
00:00:46.966 --> 00:00:49.066
With my appearance and figure, Ji Ting

21
00:00:49.066 --> 00:00:50.900
I married into a wealthy family long ago

22
00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.100
You are just a stumbling block to my happiness

23
00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.866
It's not that your father owed a huge amount of foreign debt when he was treated.

24
00:00:56.066 --> 00:00:58.800
If I hadn't played three times a day, it wouldn't be enough for you to go to school

25
00:00:58.933 --> 00:01:01.200
You would have been sold to northern Myanmar for waist cutting long ago

26
00:01:01.333 --> 00:01:02.933
Have a good day today

27
00:01:02.933 --> 00:01:04.366
You volunteered.

28
00:01:04.366 --> 00:01:05.766
I tell you Ye Feng

29
00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:07.000
There are so many people who like me

30
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.800
Without you, someone else will pay me

31
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.966
It's your pleasure to have you by my side.

32
00:01:11.966 --> 00:01:13.066
Why didn't I know before?

33
00:01:13.066 --> 00:01:14.466
You have so many suitors

34
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.666
Why don't you appreciate the honor you bestow?

35
00:01:17.666 --> 00:01:19.166
Ye Fang Tingting is right

36
00:01:19.166 --> 00:01:21.166
You have to be self-aware.

37
00:01:21.166 --> 00:01:22.533
A beautiful woman like Tingting

38
00:01:22.533 --> 00:01:25.400
You should live in high society and be envied by others

39
00:01:25.733 --> 00:01:27.000
Rather than with you

40
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.200
Relying on coolies to move bricks

41
00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.066
suffer

42
00:01:29.066 --> 00:01:30.133
And you figure it out

43
00:01:30.133 --> 00:01:31.366
You don't deserve him

44
00:01:31.366 --> 00:01:34.133
Although you gave Tingting some small favors before

45
00:01:34.133 --> 00:01:36.566
But you also delayed Tingting's three years of youth

46
00:01:37.266 --> 00:01:39.100
I guess this favor has long been paid off

47
00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:40.900
Now you owe him

48
00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:42.733
Men, be generous

49
00:01:42.733 --> 00:01:44.866
Learn to let go when it's time to let go

50
00:01:44.866 --> 00:01:46.133
Don't stalk

51
00:01:46.133 --> 00:01:48.366
Otherwise, lose face
