00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:01.466
Jasper dragon card

2
00:00:01.533 --> 00:00:04.966
The legendary jasper dragon was discovered by Jin Shang

3
00:00:04.966 --> 00:00:08.300
This card can be used anywhere in the world

4
00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:10.100
No restrictions

5
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:11.866
This Card

6
00:00:12.666 --> 00:00:14.766
Write no more than 10

7
00:00:14.766 --> 00:00:16.266
And these 10 people

8
00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:17.666
no no

9
00:00:17.666 --> 00:00:20.800
An important person who holds the lifeblood of Oshita

10
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:25.166
Even though I single-handedly created the Daxia Chamber of Commerce

11
00:00:25.166 --> 00:00:28.000
Are not eligible to have this card

12
00:00:28.866 --> 00:00:33.833
I didn't expect to see the style of this card here today

13
00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:35.400
This Card

14
00:00:36.333 --> 00:00:39.000
The best proof of self-evidence

15
00:00:39.466 --> 00:00:40.600
This gentleman

16
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.000
Can continue

17
00:00:42.766 --> 00:00:43.900
I declare

18
00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:47.800
All the lots here today.

19
00:00:48.133 --> 00:00:50.766
There are no restrictions for this gentleman

20
00:00:51.333 --> 00:00:54.033
He can participate in the auction at will

21
00:01:00.666 --> 00:01:01.700
This gentleman

22
00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.833
Will be a senior member of the Chamber of Commerce in the future

23
00:01:05.133 --> 00:01:08.233
Have the same privileges as me

24
00:01:09.066 --> 00:01:11.700
Why do you continue to argue with me?

25
00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.033
You're lucky this time

26
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:14.866
I tell you boy

27
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.800
Young people should not be too crazy

28
00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.166
Something that doesn't belong to you

29
00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.166
You have to have a solid hand, in the end

30
00:01:22.066 --> 00:01:23.900
Still no money for you

31
00:01:25.966 --> 00:01:27.400
1 billion third time

32
00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.500
Do you have a deal?

33
00:01:34.933 --> 00:01:36.100
Western treasures

34
00:01:36.333 --> 00:01:37.366
Really extraordinary

35
00:01:38.466 --> 00:01:39.266
Here you go.

36
00:01:40.866 --> 00:01:41.700
It's the first time I've seen it.

37
00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.066
Eat all over Guanming City

38
00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.733
Ouch I should have filmed this scene

39
00:01:44.733 --> 00:01:46.266
Send it to Guan Qianqian for a look.

40
00:01:46.366 --> 00:01:48.700
Let him see his brother kiss this face again

41
00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:49.900
It's fun to think about

42
00:01:50.566 --> 00:01:53.000
Does this person look particularly familiar to you?

43
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.866
The people here are all from the imperial capital family

44
00:01:54.866 --> 00:01:55.966
Familiarity is normal

45
00:01:56.666 --> 00:01:57.600
I forgot

46
00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.833
Which family of ours can have such courage?

47
00:02:01.166 --> 00:02:02.700
Maybe I read it wrong.

48
00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.200
Next, our building

49
00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.000
The Chamber of Commerce presents the finale of the highest sincerity

50
00:02:07.266 --> 00:02:08.533
Star and Moon Fairy Tale

51
00:02:08.533 --> 00:02:10.200
It turned out to be a star and moon fairy tale

52
00:02:11.266 --> 00:02:13.133
This is not the paradise my grandfather made for me

53
00:02:13.133 --> 00:02:14.300
Star and moon fairy tale?
