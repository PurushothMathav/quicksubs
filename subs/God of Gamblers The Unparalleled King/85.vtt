00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.266
This is the mall part of the new moon fairy tale

2
00:00:08.266 --> 00:00:10.200
The office section is in the back

3
00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:12.800
New Moon Fairy Tale has started trial business

4
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.233
Traffic counting is good

5
00:00:15.466 --> 00:00:18.633
When I was a kid, this was a wheat field.

6
00:00:19.133 --> 00:00:21.500
Grandpa always took me to play in this place

7
00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.800
He also said that he would prepare a big gift for me as a dowry

8
00:00:23.866 --> 00:00:25.366
How time flies!

9
00:00:25.366 --> 00:00:27.500
It's a new neighborhood.

10
00:00:27.566 --> 00:00:29.666
Your grandfather sees that you are so outstanding now

11
00:00:29.666 --> 00:00:30.600
Will be pleased

12
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.300
There are successors in the Shangguan family

13
00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:36.400
Hello

14
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.166
What good I see

15
00:00:40.166 --> 00:00:42.166
Wait for me, I'll be right over

16
00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:44.666
I have a project to go back to catch up on

17
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.133
You hang around here

18
00:00:46.133 --> 00:00:47.366
I'll be right back.

19
00:00:47.366 --> 00:00:49.566
OK, go ahead.

20
00:00:52.866 --> 00:00:54.566
Hey Zhang Hui

21
00:00:54.566 --> 00:00:57.033
Why are you here?

22
00:00:57.566 --> 00:00:59.266
It's really you, Ye Feng

23
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.233
I said why does it look familiar?

24
00:01:03.733 --> 00:01:05.366
Haven't seen you in so many years

25
00:01:05.766 --> 00:01:08.100
You still look pitiful.

26
00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.100
Since graduating from junior high school

27
00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.666
We were all separated.

28
00:01:13.366 --> 00:01:16.100
I didn't expect to meet you here

29
00:01:16.866 --> 00:01:18.066
So many classmates

30
00:01:18.066 --> 00:01:20.233
Few can come to the imperial capital to develop

31
00:01:20.933 --> 00:01:21.833
presumably

32
00:01:22.533 --> 00:01:24.833
You should be doing well by now

33
00:01:25.333 --> 00:01:27.066
In fact, I have been in Ningcheng

34
00:01:27.333 --> 00:01:29.966
This visit to the capital is for someone

35
00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:37.633
You're so blunt

36
00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.700
Sorry for the weirdness.

37
00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.166
I still remember

38
00:01:43.333 --> 00:01:45.500
You wrote me a love letter back then

39
00:01:48.066 --> 00:01:48.866
classmate

40
00:01:49.466 --> 00:01:50.666
Love letter to you

41
00:01:55.866 --> 00:01:57.866
He likes me.

42
00:02:06.266 --> 00:02:08.066
Did you give me a love letter?

43
00:02:08.133 --> 00:02:09.800
I promise to help you deliver love letters

44
00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.600
I'm not asking for answers

45
00:02:12.266 --> 00:02:13.733
I think you got it wrong.

46
00:02:13.733 --> 00:02:16.166
I didn't write the love letter at all
