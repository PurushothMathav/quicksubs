00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:01.266
Mr. Ye

2
00:00:01.266 --> 00:00:03.566
He is our most distinguished guest here

3
00:00:05.366 --> 00:00:06.833
Ye Ye Gongzi

4
00:00:07.466 --> 00:00:09.800
I didn't know your status was so high just now.

5
00:00:10.166 --> 00:00:13.066
Why don't we get to know each other again?

6
00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:18.566
Excuse me?

7
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.300
I'm a neat freak too

8
00:00:21.133 --> 00:00:22.833
Apologize

9
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.966
But if you can finish this bottle of wine

10
00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:27.366
I will forgive

11
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.233
Okay, wait.

12
00:00:32.266 --> 00:00:33.600
I'm talking about this bottle.

13
00:00:35.366 --> 00:00:38.766
This is the most precious wine in Great Xia

14
00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:42.033
If you drink it, you will die. Don't dare to drink it.

15
00:00:45.866 --> 00:00:46.866
Sorry, everybody.

16
00:00:46.933 --> 00:00:48.366
I have something to do with Mr. Ye

17
00:00:48.366 --> 00:00:49.566
Let's go first

18
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.266
Stop, I'm almost scared by you

19
00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.666
I already investigated before I came

20
00:00:56.666 --> 00:00:58.966
The Shangguan family didn't take you seriously at all

21
00:00:58.966 --> 00:01:01.000
You must be the one with the Shangguan family's money

22
00:01:01.133 --> 00:01:02.666
Hui Lu, the waiter just now

23
00:01:02.766 --> 00:01:04.366
Then let him help you act

24
00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.166
I don't understand what you're saying.

25
00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.800
We were almost deceived by him.

26
00:01:12.466 --> 00:01:14.300
Ah, excuse me.

27
00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:15.966
I'm the general manager here.

28
00:01:15.966 --> 00:01:18.566
My surname is Qu and I'm still pretending to be garlic, right?

29
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:19.533
District manager?

30
00:01:19.533 --> 00:01:20.700
Here's some crap.

31
00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.366
Congratulations to your hotel staff

32
00:01:22.366 --> 00:01:23.500
I got caught in the act

33
00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.266
See for yourself.

34
00:01:25.266 --> 00:01:26.900
What? That employee?

35
00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:28.400
Deduct money again

36
00:01:28.933 --> 00:01:30.233
My limited edition of good wine

37
00:01:30.766 --> 00:01:32.600
This wine is for display

38
00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:33.866
We don't sell it.

39
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.500
5 million bottle?

40
00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:36.800
Who broke him?
