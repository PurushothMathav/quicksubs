00:00:00.533 --> 00:00:02.833
What? He's the chairperson?

2
00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:04.500
That's not possible.

3
00:00:04.666 --> 00:00:06.800
How could he, a bumpkin, be the chairperson?

4
00:00:06.966 --> 00:00:08.666
If the chairperson

5
00:00:09.966 --> 00:00:11.500
That cost nine billion to buy a new one

6
00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:12.966
He is the one in the same flower as the moon

7
00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:15.233
I heard he was a super big shot

8
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.066
That's not possible.

9
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.066
I must be dreaming

10
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:22.566
You stinky woman

11
00:00:22.566 --> 00:00:24.333
I've been hurt by you

12
00:00:24.333 --> 00:00:25.400
All because of you

13
00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.200
I've been fired from Xinyue Call, I'm telling you

14
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:29.366
I'm not done with you

15
00:00:31.866 --> 00:00:33.266
Be careful what you say

16
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.533
From now on we break up

17
00:00:35.533 --> 00:00:37.433
You're not my boyfriend anymore

18
00:00:38.466 --> 00:00:41.666
Hmph, just wait to be fired by Hope Fairy Tale

19
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:47.800
Ye Feng, wait for me Ye Feng

20
00:00:49.133 --> 00:00:49.933
Ye Feng

21
00:00:51.566 --> 00:00:53.700
I think after get off work

22
00:00:55.266 --> 00:00:57.066
I'll treat you to dinner alone

23
00:00:57.866 --> 00:00:59.500
Haven't seen you in so many years

24
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:01.566
I miss you so much

25
00:01:03.366 --> 00:01:06.566
Didn't you date your boyfriend after get off work? No

26
00:01:07.166 --> 00:01:09.433
That loser has become an ex

27
00:01:09.766 --> 00:01:12.066
I'm single now.

28
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.766
Fine. I'm not interested in you being single or not.

29
00:01:20.466 --> 00:01:23.800
I know you have a crush on me

30
00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.000
I'm not taking the initiative to be single again.

31
00:01:29.066 --> 00:01:30.400
Give you a chance.

32
00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.566
You can chase me now.

33
00:01:34.166 --> 00:01:35.033
Excuse me.

34
00:01:35.166 --> 00:01:36.400
I have something else to do

35
00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.800
I don't have time to listen to what you have to say

36
00:01:39.366 --> 00:01:41.300
Ye Fang, you can't go

37
00:01:41.933 --> 00:01:43.766
You used to like me

38
00:01:43.766 --> 00:01:45.366
Why don't you admit it?

39
00:01:46.066 --> 00:01:47.866
Why can't you admit it?

40
00:01:48.266 --> 00:01:49.433
Are you

41
00:01:49.933 --> 00:01:51.500
Misunderstood me

42
00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.600
Or have you changed your mind?

43
00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.700
You must make it clear to me today
