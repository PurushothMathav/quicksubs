1
00:00:00.933 --> 00:00:03.366
Linglong, why did you bring a man back?

2
00:00:03.366 --> 00:00:04.400
Who is he?

3
00:00:05.366 --> 00:00:07.800
You bad girl

4
00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.333
Let me introduce you

5
00:00:09.333 --> 00:00:10.666
This is my husband, Ye Feng

6
00:00:11.133 --> 00:00:12.300
My Husband

7
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.600
What the hell is going on here?

8
00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:17.266
Doesn't Miss Shangguan have an engagement with the official plan?

9
00:00:17.366 --> 00:00:18.166
What's going on?

10
00:00:18.166 --> 00:00:19.133
Shangguan Linglong

11
00:00:19.133 --> 00:00:20.533
How dare you!

12
00:00:20.533 --> 00:00:22.800
How dare you ignore the engagement your grandmother made for you

13
00:00:23.366 --> 00:00:25.266
Silently carrying the family

14
00:00:25.333 --> 00:00:27.166
Bringing a wild man through the door

15
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.766
You are not paying attention to the official's family.

16
00:00:29.766 --> 00:00:31.633
I didn't even pay attention to my grandmother

17
00:00:32.666 --> 00:00:33.466
Linglong

18
00:00:33.966 --> 00:00:35.833
Is that true?

19
00:00:37.066 --> 00:00:39.000
You are ridiculous

20
00:00:39.666 --> 00:00:41.333
Marriage of an aristocratic family

21
00:00:41.333 --> 00:00:43.366
Do you have the final say?

22
00:00:44.066 --> 00:00:45.166
Shangguan Linglong

23
00:00:45.466 --> 00:00:47.566
Look what you've done.

24
00:00:49.166 --> 00:00:51.066
Our Shangguan family's birthday banquet

25
00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:54.200
Can anyone get in?

26
00:00:54.366 --> 00:00:56.966
Why don't you take him out of here?

27
00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.633
Lest a mouse shit be exchanged for a pot of soup

28
00:01:00.666 --> 00:01:03.066
Grandma marriage event

29
00:01:03.066 --> 00:01:04.900
How dare Linglong make her own decisions?

30
00:01:05.066 --> 00:01:07.066
Ye Feng is grandfather Shangguan Wuji

31
00:01:07.133 --> 00:01:09.400
The engagement partner personally set that year

32
00:01:09.866 --> 00:01:12.566
Why can't he enter the Shangguan family's birthday banquet?

33
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:14.400
Is this the Guan family?

34
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.866
Why did you read out another marriage contract?

35
00:01:17.333 --> 00:01:18.800
Listen to what he means

36
00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.566
It seems that the joint is behind

37
00:01:20.733 --> 00:01:24.166
Do you want me to break my word in Shangguan's house?
