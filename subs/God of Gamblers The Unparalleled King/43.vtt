00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:01.800
I am willing to marry Guan Mingcheng

2
00:00:05.533 --> 00:00:07.466
Jokes on my big brother's terms

3
00:00:07.466 --> 00:00:09.700
There are many people who want to marry him

4
00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:10.933
What are you?

5
00:00:10.933 --> 00:00:13.100
It's your blessing that he has a crush on you.

6
00:00:13.166 --> 00:00:15.300
If I hadn't seen you as my future sister-in-law

7
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:17.366
I won't let you go for a long time

8
00:00:17.533 --> 00:00:20.100
Today I exempt your Shangguan family from responsibility

9
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.900
But he's just a wild dog

10
00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.400
How dare you criticize the official

11
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.100
And insult the Lord of Heaven

12
00:00:25.133 --> 00:00:26.766
Let him leave easily today

13
00:00:26.766 --> 00:00:28.266
Isn't it making people laugh at my official family?

14
00:00:28.266 --> 00:00:30.266
Ridiculous, Miss Guan is right

15
00:00:30.266 --> 00:00:32.833
This kid should be serious

16
00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:34.400
With formality and dignity

17
00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.100
I see which one breaks his limbs first

18
00:00:37.166 --> 00:00:39.066
Then pull it out to feed the wild dogs

19
00:00:39.066 --> 00:00:42.566
This can be regarded as an explanation to the humble lord

20
00:00:42.733 --> 00:00:44.100
It's long overdue

21
00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:47.333
The Shangguan family is a low-level fan like him, come when you want

22
00:00:47.333 --> 00:00:48.466
Do you want to leave?

23
00:00:48.466 --> 00:00:50.100
Let's see how their Shangguan family harvests

24
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.166
Check it out again.

25
00:00:52.133 --> 00:00:53.966
Ye Feng, leave quickly

26
00:00:54.366 --> 00:00:56.800
If you don't go, you will really be beaten to death by them

27
00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:57.600
Tianlong

28
00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:59.033
The world is so big

29
00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:00.666
As long as you don't want to

30
00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.700
No one can force you

31
00:01:02.866 --> 00:01:05.300
If you don't know how high the sky is, you know how to enlarge it.

32
00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:06.466
Okay, okay.

33
00:01:06.666 --> 00:01:07.700
Night wind, right?

34
00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.300
I suggest you apologize to Qianqian for making a mistake. Let's go.

35
00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:11.800
This kind of family thing

36
00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.300
It's not something you can get involved in

37
00:01:13.333 --> 00:01:14.600
And you Qianqian

38
00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.066
Receive your little temper

39
00:01:16.366 --> 00:01:18.466
He's just a commoner

40
00:01:18.533 --> 00:01:20.800
My lord won't blame a commoner

41
00:01:20.933 --> 00:01:22.400
And you hit him, didn't you?

42
00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.100
It didn't hurt your face, didn't it?

43
00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.700
For the sake of Miki speaking for you

44
00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.200
As long as you kneel down and kowtow now

45
00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.966
Crawl out of here

46
00:01:30.966 --> 00:01:32.666
I'll let it go.

47
00:01:34.266 --> 00:01:35.833
Thank you for your kindness, Miss Maggie

48
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.966
But obviously Mr. Shangguan

49
00:01:37.966 --> 00:01:40.300
Make an engagement with my elders first

50
00:01:40.866 --> 00:01:42.866
Obviously the Shangguan family breached the contract first

51
00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.400
Now the official family has come to intervene again

52
00:01:46.066 --> 00:01:47.700
Why should I apologize?

53
00:01:47.866 --> 00:01:50.000
No, why are you so ignorant?

54
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.233
What do you want?

55
00:01:51.566 --> 00:01:52.566
Very simple.

56
00:01:52.733 --> 00:01:56.600
As long as the official takes it and gets out of front of me

57
00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.033
I'll pretend it never happened
