00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.266
Grandma, don't be mad

2
00:00:02.266 --> 00:00:04.266
Exquisite body

3
00:00:04.266 --> 00:00:06.466
Just blinded by that kid

4
00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:10.033
Still you are sweet

5
00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:13.866
If everyone in our Shangguan family were like you

6
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:16.633
I don't have to worry so much

7
00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.600
Grandma

8
00:00:19.733 --> 00:00:20.866
Serve wine

9
00:00:20.866 --> 00:00:22.100
You can see that it's a good wine.

10
00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:23.200
Yeah, yeah.

11
00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.433
Today is grandma's birthday

12
00:00:26.566 --> 00:00:28.033
Have fun, grandma

13
00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:33.800
Give him a drink too

14
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.233
Mr. Ye, please

15
00:00:42.366 --> 00:00:44.033
Can you smell the fragrance?

16
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.266
There is a faint fragrance

17
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.166
That's too cold.

18
00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:50.800
The temperature is just right

19
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:52.566
Then why don't you drink it?

20
00:00:52.566 --> 00:00:54.866
Can't take a sip

21
00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.600
You need to know the origin of this wine

22
00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.166
I'm afraid I won't be so stubborn

23
00:01:01.066 --> 00:01:03.100
Oh, how did that happen?

24
00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:03.900
Humph

25
00:01:04.266 --> 00:01:08.366
This wine is a limited edition Sendai personal order

26
00:01:08.533 --> 00:01:10.066
Master Brewing

27
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.566
120,000 bottle

28
00:01:13.066 --> 00:01:15.200
Can you take this sip?

29
00:01:15.333 --> 00:01:17.800
Is it your salary for a few months?

30
00:01:18.766 --> 00:01:20.400
This glass of wine

31
00:01:20.733 --> 00:01:24.033
It's a haute couture

32
00:01:24.066 --> 00:01:26.400
This set is only available in the world.

33
00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:30.000
Today, touch this plate

34
00:01:30.366 --> 00:01:32.200
Take this sip of wine

35
00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.366
It's a blessing you can't enjoy in this life

36
00:01:35.666 --> 00:01:37.233
Since you don't eat

37
00:01:37.466 --> 00:01:39.233
It means you don't have this life

38
00:01:39.666 --> 00:01:41.766
You were born Wall-E

39
00:01:41.766 --> 00:01:43.233
Not porcelain

40
00:01:43.366 --> 00:01:45.233
If I were you

41
00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:49.600
I don't want to continue this marriage now

42
00:01:49.766 --> 00:01:53.366
Instead, use this unattainable marriage of yours

43
00:01:53.466 --> 00:01:56.633
In exchange for some real compensation

44
00:01:58.166 --> 00:02:00.466
Madam, you are wrong

45
00:02:00.866 --> 00:02:02.833
This glass of wine is drunk by me

46
00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.166
It's his pleasure
