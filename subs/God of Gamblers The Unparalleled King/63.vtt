00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:02.600
Hello, sir.

2
00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:04.966
Do you have an appointment? My name is Wang Yalei.

3
00:00:06.166 --> 00:00:07.166
Certainly, Mr Wang.

4
00:00:07.166 --> 00:00:08.133
Your private room is on the second floor.

5
00:00:08.133 --> 00:00:11.200
Brother Wang on the second floor is too generous

6
00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.600
Who doesn't know that Fuping Hotel has a total of three floors

7
00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:15.566
Private rooms are only available above the second floor.

8
00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:17.400
The higher the floor, the more expensive the private room.

9
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.100
The more prominent the status

10
00:00:19.566 --> 00:00:22.100
Ordinary people have identity authentication when they enter the first floor to eat

11
00:00:22.266 --> 00:00:24.666
Brother Fang can actually book a private room on the second floor

12
00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:26.400
Real cow

13
00:00:27.066 --> 00:00:28.333
Hello, it's over there.

14
00:00:28.333 --> 00:00:29.866
This way, please.

15
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.066
Hello Mr. Ye

16
00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:33.300
Do you know him?

17
00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.933
Black Diamond VIP is our supreme guest

18
00:00:35.933 --> 00:00:38.400
We must remember your appearance as a sign of respect

19
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.100
Please take your seat first

20
00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:41.600
I'll go and inform the manager.

21
00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.233
It's a pleasure to host you.

22
00:00:45.866 --> 00:00:46.766
Pardon me?

23
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.233
Ye Bo and his girlfriend came to us for dinner

24
00:00:49.666 --> 00:00:51.166
Yes, yes, Mr. Ye

25
00:00:51.166 --> 00:00:52.300
Uh Mr. Davis

26
00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:54.633
Released his photo across the group the day before yesterday

27
00:00:54.666 --> 00:00:56.766
I remember clearly that it was him

28
00:00:56.933 --> 00:00:58.500
But uh

29
00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:00.833
Manager, why don't you receive him in person?

30
00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.600
Oh, am I good enough?

31
00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:05.266
Ah, what to do then?

32
00:01:06.766 --> 00:01:09.566
So Mr. Davis happens to be my guest today

33
00:01:09.666 --> 00:01:11.366
I'll go over and ask him for instructions myself

34
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:12.833
That's all.
