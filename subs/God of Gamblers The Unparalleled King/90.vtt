00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:03.833
Miss Zhang, please respect yourself.

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.133
I already have a wife

3
00:00:05.133 --> 00:00:07.200
Wife, you are married.

4
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:09.633
I don't believe it.

5
00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:11.900
You said that on purpose to provoke me, right?

6
00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:12.700
After all

7
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:17.033
I have never seen a more beautiful woman than me

8
00:00:18.466 --> 00:00:20.466
You can't do it for an ugly guy

9
00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.700
Don't you want me, a beautiful woman who has been in love with you for many years?

10
00:00:24.166 --> 00:00:25.666
You're being ironic.

11
00:00:26.366 --> 00:00:28.166
You care about me, right?

12
00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:29.400
Ye Feng

13
00:00:30.333 --> 00:00:33.200
You are already the chairperson of the new moon fairy tale

14
00:00:33.266 --> 00:00:35.300
Stop feeling inferior

15
00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.433
You can say you like me now

16
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.800
I rejected you before

17
00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.500
It's all for your own good

18
00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:48.066
I want you to put your mind on studying.

19
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.033
You see, you've finally made it.

20
00:00:52.133 --> 00:00:55.966
You can ask me out for dinner now

21
00:00:58.166 --> 00:00:59.033
and

22
00:01:01.466 --> 00:01:04.300
My family lives near the company

23
00:01:05.066 --> 00:01:06.600
After dinner

24
00:01:08.466 --> 00:01:10.200
We can still

25
00:01:10.566 --> 00:01:11.733
This lady

26
00:01:11.733 --> 00:01:14.633
Are you trying to snatch my fiancÃ© from Shangguan Linglong?

27
00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.700
What if you are Miss Shangguan?

28
00:01:19.066 --> 00:01:21.566
The person Ye Feng likes is me

29
00:01:23.533 --> 00:01:26.400
I'm sorry, Miss Li, I may have to disappoint you.

30
00:01:26.666 --> 00:01:28.666
Ye Fang doesn't like you

31
00:01:28.766 --> 00:01:30.266
The whole school knows

32
00:01:30.466 --> 00:01:32.566
About him sending love letters

33
00:01:32.866 --> 00:01:36.000
He is also delivering for others, and it is impossible for you to lie.

34
00:01:36.366 --> 00:01:37.333
What's the truth?

35
00:01:37.333 --> 00:01:39.600
You can ask your junior high school classmates.

36
00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:41.166
The fact that the cape doesn't like you

37
00:01:41.166 --> 00:01:43.300
The whole school knows except you

38
00:01:43.966 --> 00:01:44.766
Humph
