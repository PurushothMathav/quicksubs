00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.766
How dare someone steal something from the official?

2
00:00:02.766 --> 00:00:03.900
Pretty bold

3
00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:05.766
I don't know which Shakyamuni it is

4
00:00:05.933 --> 00:00:07.733
Did you notice this person's voice?

5
00:00:07.733 --> 00:00:09.066
Sound a little familiar

6
00:00:10.166 --> 00:00:12.966
Arguing with me is self-defeating

7
00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:14.766
I'm afraid you don't have the capital

8
00:00:15.133 --> 00:00:17.600
88 million 88 million and one cent

9
00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:18.400
Excuse me.

10
00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.433
This gentleman's bid is at least 190 million

11
00:00:21.466 --> 00:00:23.366
Nine thousand one 100,000

12
00:00:23.466 --> 00:00:25.633
What do you mean?

13
00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:26.966
Yuck me, right?

14
00:00:26.966 --> 00:00:27.900
Let me tell you something.

15
00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.966
You dare to embarrass our officials in public

16
00:00:30.166 --> 00:00:31.800
You better be careful

17
00:00:31.966 --> 00:00:35.100
Don't force me, I'll see if you move a real one.

18
00:00:35.166 --> 00:00:38.900
91 million 91.1 million you

19
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.800
Night by Night

20
00:00:41.866 --> 00:00:44.333
Master Kuan is really rich

21
00:00:44.333 --> 00:00:45.666
So wrong

22
00:00:47.266 --> 00:00:48.600
Will not be a child of an aristocratic family

23
00:00:49.466 --> 00:00:50.633
The knot is strong

24
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.333
It seems that the price of this exquisite phoenix has peaked.

25
00:00:54.333 --> 00:00:57.200
Increase the price, why don't you add it?

26
00:00:57.466 --> 00:01:00.066
Oh, there's no money on this hand.

27
00:01:00.333 --> 00:01:03.366
Ah, I thought how capable the Guan family was

28
00:01:03.666 --> 00:01:04.966
But that's it.

29
00:01:06.966 --> 00:01:09.066
1 billion dollars
