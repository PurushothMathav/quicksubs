00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:02.000
Laugh at you

2
00:00:02.133 --> 00:00:04.366
Does this guy know what he's talking about?

3
00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:07.566
Mr. Ye also established meritorious deeds in the past

4
00:00:07.666 --> 00:00:09.200
And he's right.

5
00:00:09.866 --> 00:00:11.433
Jade dragon is not what I said

6
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:13.766
Just like him, now, distinguished guests, excuse me

7
00:00:13.766 --> 00:00:15.666
Our manager explained that you are all VIPs.

8
00:00:15.666 --> 00:00:17.700
It's not appropriate to eat in a private room like ours

9
00:00:17.733 --> 00:00:19.300
You can follow me to the third floor for dinner

10
00:00:19.366 --> 00:00:22.766
The third floor is a top VIP.

11
00:00:23.333 --> 00:00:24.800
Your manager has a good eye.

12
00:00:25.166 --> 00:00:26.566
Come on, class.

13
00:00:26.766 --> 00:00:28.166
Let's go to the third floor and sit

14
00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:34.666
Oh, I forgot to take the two luxury car keys haha.

15
00:00:35.266 --> 00:00:36.066
Ah!

16
00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:37.866
Let's go too

17
00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.366
Mr. Ye, please go to the third floor

18
00:00:43.366 --> 00:00:44.800
Our manager explained it.

19
00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:51.700
Wow, this is the supreme private room on the third floor

20
00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:53.466
Have a look at the collection.

21
00:00:53.466 --> 00:00:54.266
I want to take a picture.

22
00:00:54.266 --> 00:00:56.266
I want all the students who didn't come to see it

23
00:00:56.266 --> 00:00:58.800
This is the first time I have boarded the VIP room on the third floor

24
00:00:59.333 --> 00:01:01.000
Wow, so much wine!

25
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.800
Do you see it?

26
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.300
This is the advantage of foreigners

27
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.466
It's not like some people don't know anything

28
00:01:05.466 --> 00:01:06.800
You have to follow the light.

29
00:01:07.666 --> 00:01:09.266
Now that you know me

30
00:01:09.266 --> 00:01:11.033
Then follow the unexpected rules

31
00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:12.433
Use my identity

32
00:01:12.566 --> 00:01:15.166
It stands to reason that it should be discounted.

33
00:01:15.933 --> 00:01:18.600
But I'm not a greedy person.

34
00:01:18.733 --> 00:01:20.500
Here's your tip.

35
00:01:20.766 --> 00:01:22.400
We can't accept tips here.

36
00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.700
Not allowed, sorry, uh

37
00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:27.166
But our manager's words have a special explanation.

38
00:01:27.166 --> 00:01:29.833
All your purchases today are free.

39
00:01:29.866 --> 00:01:33.000
Good to see, it's still Brother Wang's face

40
00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.600
How about you keep saying

41
00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.700
Look down on my billionaire identity

42
00:01:37.933 --> 00:01:39.600
But our identity

43
00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:40.400
Possible

44
00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.533
It's a privilege you'll never get in your life

45
00:01:42.533 --> 00:01:45.433
This hotel is a model hotel

46
00:01:46.466 --> 00:01:50.000
And I'm an executive in a branch of the model

47
00:01:50.466 --> 00:01:52.500
They just recognized me.

48
00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.966
I will give you free services.

49
00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.100
You think it's for your sake

50
00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:57.933
Bought by you

51
00:01:57.933 --> 00:01:59.166
Not for my sake

52
00:01:59.166 --> 00:02:01.433
Is it because of your face?

53
00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:02.866
Yes, you are Ye

54
00:02:02.866 --> 00:02:03.966
Sir's face
