00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.100
Mr. Ye, the heads of state have arrived

2
00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:07.966
Waiting for you.

3
00:00:07.966 --> 00:00:10.033
Got it. Keep them waiting.

4
00:00:35.333 --> 00:00:37.533
The issue of ownership of 10 cities in Qinzhou

5
00:00:37.533 --> 00:00:39.600
The representatives of the two countries are sidelined and contested

6
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.400
Hasn't dealt up the ante limit?

7
00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:03.700
Your back cover count

8
00:01:04.066 --> 00:01:05.466
Up the ante

9
00:01:10.933 --> 00:01:12.766
Ye Feng's ten cities in England

10
00:01:12.766 --> 00:01:14.166
You and I are evenly matched

11
00:01:14.366 --> 00:01:14.933
This one

12
00:01:14.933 --> 00:01:17.200
I will give you the Wucheng captured by Yingzhou

13
00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.566
Let's compete

14
00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:23.800
Sure, I'll bet you an extra ten cities

15
00:01:24.133 --> 00:01:25.466
Double the bets

16
00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.766
You and I who lost at our own expense

17
00:01:32.666 --> 00:01:33.466
What!

18
00:01:33.966 --> 00:01:35.033
That's not possible.

19
00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.266
Kill him!

20
00:01:44.466 --> 00:01:46.566
Somebody kill him for me
