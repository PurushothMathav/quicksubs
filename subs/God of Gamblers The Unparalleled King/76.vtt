1
00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.666
Which son is this?

2
00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:04.266
Even Guan Ming Chengdu was crushed by him

3
00:00:04.266 --> 00:00:06.966
More than that, even if the Guan family head comes

4
00:00:06.966 --> 00:00:08.466
Can't get so much

5
00:00:08.566 --> 00:00:10.366
If only I could marry such a man

6
00:00:10.366 --> 00:00:12.300
All the sisters in the circle have to envy me

7
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.666
How dare this person hire someone to challenge Guan Mingcheng

8
00:00:14.666 --> 00:00:15.866
It's not just a disease.

9
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:18.966
Why have you seen him?

10
00:00:19.966 --> 00:00:21.166
The back is awesome

11
00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:22.966
After my auction is over

12
00:00:22.966 --> 00:00:24.833
I'll accompany you to have a look, okay?

13
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.433
Okay 1 billion dollars for the first time

14
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.333
1 billion second time

15
00:00:30.333 --> 00:00:32.700
Guys, I now suspect he is pressing

16
00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.133
There is no capital to pay

17
00:00:34.133 --> 00:00:36.366
He came to the auction purely to make trouble

18
00:00:36.366 --> 00:00:37.233
Do not call the police indiscriminately

19
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:39.700
Planning seriously

20
00:00:40.733 --> 00:00:43.400
Xiuchang is going to investigate him now

21
00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:44.666
Liquidity on hand

22
00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.833
Let's see if he's good enough to participate next

23
00:00:46.966 --> 00:00:48.566
Are you kidding?

24
00:00:49.366 --> 00:00:50.866
Just 1 billion dollars

25
00:00:51.333 --> 00:00:53.900
As for this gentleman

26
00:00:54.533 --> 00:00:55.566
I promise

27
00:00:55.566 --> 00:00:58.300
We at Weili International are ready to pay the bill.

28
00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.000
You can look down on me when you say such a thing.

29
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.833
So you're going to pay for him?

30
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.966
Let me give you a heads up.

31
00:01:08.966 --> 00:01:09.600
Don't you forget

32
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.366
You Willie International are in this situation today

33
00:01:11.366 --> 00:01:12.566
Who caused it?

34
00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.166
There is an ancient Chinese saying

35
00:01:16.066 --> 00:01:17.466
Learn from it.

36
00:01:18.733 --> 00:01:19.666
Attention

37
00:01:20.166 --> 00:01:23.100
If it weren't for me not being qualified to ask Mr. to pay

38
00:01:23.566 --> 00:01:25.566
I'd like to see what else you have

39
00:01:26.166 --> 00:01:28.066
Stop arguing

40
00:01:28.666 --> 00:01:31.466
Since this Mr. Ye is so rich

41
00:01:31.666 --> 00:01:33.266
Aren't you afraid of Stefanie?

42
00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:35.600
swallow

43
00:01:40.266 --> 00:01:42.566
This is hell Longgang
