00:00:00.933 --> 00:00:02.100
I really doubt it.

2
00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:02.766
Before you come

3
00:00:02.766 --> 00:00:04.133
Did you drink your bulk bottle of wine?

4
00:00:04.133 --> 00:00:05.600
Alcoholism

5
00:00:05.733 --> 00:00:07.266
Let my official apologize

6
00:00:07.266 --> 00:00:10.800
You deserve it too, thank you Xie Xiaoqi, I'll count it

7
00:00:12.466 --> 00:00:13.800
I know you're not convinced

8
00:00:14.066 --> 00:00:15.866
But power is stronger than people

9
00:00:15.966 --> 00:00:17.333
First reward the lord Weiming Hehe

10
00:00:17.333 --> 00:00:18.866
It's breezy.

11
00:00:18.966 --> 00:00:21.233
Even the enemy country dare not confront him head-on

12
00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:24.000
He can actually reward treasures such as the glorious Sendai of the official family

13
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.966
Appreciate him for the official

14
00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:27.533
Power is hard

15
00:00:27.533 --> 00:00:30.166
You can't fight him precisely because he personally sealed you.

16
00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.000
So you have to do it right.

17
00:00:32.066 --> 00:00:36.400
Sit tight or threaten boldly

18
00:00:36.666 --> 00:00:38.600
Do you dare to ask who lived in the sky?

19
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.100
How did this title come about?

20
00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:41.166
How could you?

21
00:00:42.266 --> 00:00:44.833
I appreciate this girl's heart

22
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.766
But from time to time it is the official family who is praised

23
00:00:47.933 --> 00:00:50.466
And what they sent is counterfeit

24
00:00:50.733 --> 00:00:52.800
I really saw you today

25
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.000
The face of the poor

26
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.166
It's the first time I've seen my mouth so hard

27
00:00:56.366 --> 00:00:58.566
I really don't cry without seeing the coffin

28
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.166
If these were thousands of counterfeits

29
00:01:02.166 --> 00:01:03.800
So what else is true?

30
00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.133
Did you give them those?

31
00:01:05.133 --> 00:01:06.900
Wearing fake wine for a blind date?

32
00:01:07.333 --> 00:01:09.033
I'm really curious.

33
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.766
Like you, a poor man who lives by selling his physical strength

34
00:01:12.766 --> 00:01:13.966
No money

35
00:01:13.966 --> 00:01:15.333
Status but no status

36
00:01:15.333 --> 00:01:16.966
Power but not power

37
00:01:17.066 --> 00:01:18.933
Who gave you the courage?

38
00:01:18.933 --> 00:01:21.833
You can get something like Glory Sendai

39
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.766
You think I have no power, no status, no wealth

40
00:01:25.933 --> 00:01:27.233
No confidence

41
00:01:28.333 --> 00:01:29.700
But you don't know

42
00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.666
Precious items in your eyes

43
00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.000
In my eyes, it is all ordinary

44
00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.700
Only you care about your appearance.

45
00:01:37.333 --> 00:01:38.666
For me

46
00:01:38.666 --> 00:01:42.766
You can have as many of these things as you want.
