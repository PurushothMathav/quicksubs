00:00:00.566 --> 00:00:01.700
outrageous

2
00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:03.466
You nobody

3
00:00:04.333 --> 00:00:05.600
What qualifications do you have to comment?

4
00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:06.766
So arrogant

5
00:00:06.766 --> 00:00:08.300
Although he is threatening everyone

6
00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:09.066
But he is so handsome.

7
00:00:09.066 --> 00:00:10.133
I love it.

8
00:00:10.133 --> 00:00:11.233
This gentleman

9
00:00:11.333 --> 00:00:13.966
Although you just became our Chamber of Commerce

10
00:00:13.966 --> 00:00:15.466
Premium Member

11
00:00:15.766 --> 00:00:19.000
But if you're here on purpose

12
00:00:19.066 --> 00:00:22.866
Our Chamber of Commerce also does not welcome your trouble.

13
00:00:23.366 --> 00:00:25.033
How did the fairy tale come about tonight?

14
00:00:25.066 --> 00:00:26.600
You all know that.

15
00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:29.066
And I didn't break the rules.

16
00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.666
Nine billion cents is not at home

17
00:00:32.666 --> 00:00:35.133
Although you have the Supreme Hell Dragon Card

18
00:00:35.133 --> 00:00:36.166
Very noble

19
00:00:36.166 --> 00:00:38.300
But you deliberately disrupted the auction scene

20
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.566
Affect the experience of other bidders

21
00:00:40.666 --> 00:00:41.700
With all due respect

22
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.366
Your behavior is very inferior.

23
00:00:44.466 --> 00:00:47.233
Experts bought this product in a bad way

24
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.566
Since there is a wrong shot

25
00:00:50.133 --> 00:00:53.266
Then we don't have to follow the rules.

26
00:00:54.266 --> 00:00:55.500
outrageous

27
00:00:56.166 --> 00:00:58.766
The Guan family's style of doing things is up to you to comment

28
00:00:58.933 --> 00:01:02.066
Besides, this auction is a free auction

29
00:01:02.066 --> 00:01:03.100
The highest bidder gets

30
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.000
Who doesn't know that my Star Moon Fairy Tale follow-up Zhou Yi is infinite

31
00:01:07.266 --> 00:01:10.033
You don't let everyone auction it yourself, you want to poison it

32
00:01:10.266 --> 00:01:12.566
Then you are the enemy

33
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.700
You have to understand it this way

34
00:01:15.366 --> 00:01:16.500
No problem.

35
00:01:22.366 --> 00:01:23.433
Star and Moon

36
00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.966
I want anyone else who dares to come forward and buy a price to kill shameless
