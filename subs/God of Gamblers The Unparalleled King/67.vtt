00:00:00.466 --> 00:00:01.900
5 million God

2
00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:02.533
That's expensive.

3
00:00:02.533 --> 00:00:04.900
No, I didn't do it, I didn't do it, Manager Xu

4
00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:05.700
That's him!

5
00:00:06.266 --> 00:00:08.900
5 million me how you pay

6
00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.566
In the end, you still have to rely on Linglong to help you

7
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.700
After all, he is a soft rice eater

8
00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:15.000
Let's see what he has to say.

9
00:00:15.066 --> 00:00:17.500
I broke 5 million right?

10
00:00:17.966 --> 00:00:18.833
Ah no no no

11
00:00:18.933 --> 00:00:21.100
This wine is not worth a cent

12
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.000
This wine has been around for a long time

13
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.800
It's inconvenient for us to pack up.

14
00:00:24.866 --> 00:00:26.466
I didn't like him for a long time

15
00:00:26.466 --> 00:00:28.766
He can make you break.

16
00:00:28.766 --> 00:00:30.366
Was it his ambush?

17
00:00:30.766 --> 00:00:31.633
Somebody help me!

18
00:00:32.566 --> 00:00:33.766
What's wrong with the manager?

19
00:00:33.866 --> 00:00:37.233
Go to the main headquarters and ask for another 5 draws, no

20
00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:38.100
12 flat

21
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:39.866
It's packed.

22
00:00:40.266 --> 00:00:41.866
Bring it to Mr. Ye

23
00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45.100
When Mr. Ye has a good meal, he will bring it back to you.

24
00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:48.066
No, I was just in a bad mood.

25
00:00:48.966 --> 00:00:50.900
Manager Qiu is not mistaken, right?

26
00:00:50.966 --> 00:00:52.633
This is 5 million wine

27
00:00:53.133 --> 00:00:54.900
This is just the price on the market.

28
00:00:55.466 --> 00:00:57.066
You can't even buy it with money.

29
00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:00.500
I know you must be looking at my face

30
00:01:00.533 --> 00:01:01.733
You don't have to worry about this.

31
00:01:01.733 --> 00:01:02.766
He has nothing to do with me.

32
00:01:02.766 --> 00:01:04.933
How should you deal with it?

33
00:01:04.933 --> 00:01:07.500
May I ask your face, what face do you have?

34
00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.866
Who? Do I know you?
