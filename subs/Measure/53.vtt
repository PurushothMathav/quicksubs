00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:18.990
What did I say? Not on purpose.

2
00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:21.550
I said that was messed up, and you did it on purpose.

3
00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:38.840
The game is holding me, clothes, are they clothes?

4
00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:42.630
My clothes didn't fit well, so I returned them to the waiter.

5
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.930
How is it, very beautiful,

6
00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:50.060
You bring him to buy it, and I will save you.

7
00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:51.320
Then I won't be polite.

8
00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.850
However, when Guli and I got married,

9
00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:55.550
You still want to give me a gift.

10
00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.520
Okay, let's go get some clothes now.

11
00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:13.500
That's rude, what are you doing? You must be looking for me this way.

12
00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.190
Right? No, find them.

13
00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:26.210
Please give me a hint during the ceremony. You, just wait for me here.
