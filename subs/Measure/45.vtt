1
00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:03.750
What's your real expression?

2
00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:07.580
You're so secretive to me! I finally found a man I want to marry!

3
00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.160
Won't you please me?

4
00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:12.190
Brother is so happy!

5
00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:14.730
But what is the real relationship between you and him?

6
00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:17.240
Prince, Prince! Prince, Prince!

7
00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:20.230
Prince, Prince! Prince, Prince! Prince, Prince! Prince, Prince! Prince, Prince!

8
00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.600
Prince Wang! Prince Prince! Prince Prince! Prince Prince!

9
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.200
Prince! Prince! Prince! Prince! Prince! Prince! Prince! Prince! Prince! Prince!

10
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.360
Prince! Prince!

11
00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.020
Prince! Prince! Prince! Prince! Prince! Prince! Prince! Prince! Prince! Prince! Prince! Prince! Prince! Prince!

12
00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:32.049
Prince! Prince!

13
00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:32.570
Prince! Prince!

14
00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:38.670
Then what happened to him? Nothing. Congratulations.

15
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.740
I knew it

16
00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:44.490
You are not as happy as I am. What are you doing?

17
00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:47.920
I come back to participate

18
00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:49.680
Dozens of competitions across the four coasts

19
00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:53.280
Then don't live here anymore, sit at my house and walk here

20
00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.700
I listened to the hotel

21
00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:58.530
Can I ask you to leave the hotel and refund your drink? That’s good.

22
00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:00.950
But when you see me, I ask my fiancé to leave

23
00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:04.480
That's so rude, Lee

24
00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:05.560
Could you please introduce

25
00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:07.600
These unmarried wedding ceremonies
