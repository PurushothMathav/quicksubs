00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:02.190
You'd better think about it after you get along with me

2
00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:06.730
If you have anything to say to me, don’t let me make the noise myself. I

3
00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:09.210
Lin'er: You did it on your own without mercy.

4
00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:18.120
Let’s all think about that time when you started to scatter me, true minister, why?

5
00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:20.870
You are my best friend.

6
00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.220
In fact, you are a better friend than me.

7
00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.040
I just remember it.

8
00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:29.090
Okay, let’s talk about some practice today.

9
00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:31.670
Why were you at that party last week?

10
00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:34.680
I'm here. What happened?

11
00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:37.100
Are you really afraid to eat with you because of me?

12
00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:39.950
Yes. It flies on Monday.

13
00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:42.320
It was he who asked me to go. Because it was

14
00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:45.580
No, you are what I often do naturally

15
00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:47.360
After disappearing from his world

16
00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:00.280
Don't bid anymore. I understand, I don't understand, I can't.

17
00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:01.770
it's because of me

18
00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.860
it's your fault

19
00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:06.070
Don't do it from now on

20
00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.020
I'll take it home first

21
00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:10.350
Then I look for something

22
00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.910
Because I put it to work

23
00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:15.380
I want to visit Yunzhou first

24
00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:25.340
you promise me

25
00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:26.660
Let me go to see him alone
