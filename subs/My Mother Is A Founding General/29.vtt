00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:01.840
Master, this misunderstanding.

2
00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:04.000
This is a misunderstanding, right right right right right right

3
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.200
It's all a misunderstanding.

4
00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:06.540
Don't take it personally.

5
00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:07.780
Mrs Lee.

6
00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:09.940
That's not good.

7
00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.460
It's also because you grew up.

8
00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:14.000
Say something.

9
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.060
Mother-in-law.

10
00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.780
Thousands of mistakes are our fault.

11
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.580
Can you just let us go for the sake of the future?

12
00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.320
Van Hieu, please, Mom.

13
00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:24.040
How is that possible?

14
00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:25.460
How is that possible?

15
00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:26.900
I knew early today.

16
00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.460
Why at first

17
00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.360
What else can you say now?

18
00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:34.160
Hey, hey, Master Liu

19
00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:35.120
It's all a misunderstanding.

20
00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.600
Today's story is all about King Security and Su family.

21
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.400


22
00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:43.840
Haha, Wei, you're not wrong, that's right.

23
00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:45.800
We don't want to be involved.

24
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.200
It's really unfair.

25
00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:48.240
Even so.

26
00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:50.820
What we did today wasn't very thoughtful.

27
00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:53.800
I crashed into it before I found it, ma'am.

28
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.220
It's our fault.

29
00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.600
But also deceived by others.

30
00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.280
Hai Ham please

31
00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.560
The Zheng family agreed to compensate Ms. Li.

32
00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:02.840
If the lady requests anything.

33
00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:04.780
The staff will do their best to satisfy you.

34
00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:05.960
You're welcome.

35
00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:06.760
That's right.

36
00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.840
Our Lady and our King.

37
00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:13.020
Oh my God, we're to blame today for believing that kid's words.

38
00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:19.140
Otherwise, we can't confront the lady.

39
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.080
It's all a misunderstanding.

40
00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:21.960
It's all a misunderstanding.

41
00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.660
misunderstanding

42
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.300
A misunderstanding is a misunderstanding.

43
00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:29.140
If there is a misunderstanding

44
00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.460
Then I'm not going to go into it.

45
00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:35.020
Guys.

46
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.700
Cut yourself off.
