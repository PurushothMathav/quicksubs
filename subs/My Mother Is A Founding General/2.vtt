00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:02.360
What's wrong with your face?

2
00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:03.820
Accidentally fell.

3
00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.760
Hoang hasn't seen you in years.

4
00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:13.780
You're selling tofu brains here.

5
00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.520
I was hiding in remote places like Lac Phuong village.

6
00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.300
How can you find me?

7
00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:21.340
You are the emperor now.

8
00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:23.920
Don t you need to go to court?

9
00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:27.400
You are the one who is sitting in that position.

10
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.120
That year you led us to revolt.

11
00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:32.680
Cut the infidels, kill the tyrant of the towel, don't let the men do the work.

12
00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.400
But when you succeed, you choose to retreat quickly.

13
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.200
Give me the throne.

14
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.660
I'm guilty in my heart.

15
00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.640
That's the past.

16
00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:42.440
Mrs. Hoang

17
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.020
You say you want to live a normal life.

18
00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:46.120
The Godfather

19
00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:46.960
Give birth

20
00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.960
But you know how many villages I've come to find you.

21
00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:51.540
How many people to look for

22
00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:53.240
There's no news.

23
00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:54.460
I thought...

24
00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.020
I'll never see you again.

25
00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.760
Who told you to come find me?

26
00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.100
You are your emperor.

27
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.480
I took my tofu stand.

28
00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:03.600
We're all fine.

29
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:04.840
Isn't that good?

30
00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:07.420
This summer can't be a day without troops.

31
00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.580
You should go home quickly, but you

32
00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.700
Li Huining, you have a letter from the capital.

33
00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:24.780
Thank you.

34
00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.340
You're welcome.

35
00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:34.160
Dear Hoang, this letter is my son's letter of peace.

36
00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.220
My son is in the royal family this year.

37
00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.680
I am talking about marriage with my wife.

38
00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:39.740
This baby.

39
00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.780
I want to go to the city to see them get married.

40
00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:46.880
Mom.

41
00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.840
The baby will soon be married to her daughter.

42
00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:51.320
I would like to welcome you to the city for the ceremony.

43
00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:52.840
But this trip is high and far away.

44
00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:53.960
Lawton Transportation

45
00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:55.340
You've never been far.

46
00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:56.940
Your baby doesn t want you to be affected.

47
00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:58.180
Married this time.

48
00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.700
Don't come anymore.
