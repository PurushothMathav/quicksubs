00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.140
She's just a rural woman.

2
00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:05.800
Regardless of wealth, status, power, ability.

3
00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:09.200
Why did you protect her according to Your Majesty s will?

4
00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:10.300
It's her identity.

5
00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:13.140
More noble than you think.

6
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.200
It's still here.

7
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.720
I've lived with her for ten years.

8
00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.140
I know who she is best.

9
00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.820
She's just a family.

10
00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:26.100
Poor village girl

11
00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.540
What noble status can there be?

12
00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:31.640
The reason she's messing around here

13
00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:32.840
Whatever.

14
00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.900
Because I was made king by Your Majesty.

15
00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:37.700
She's jealous.

16
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.980
So I came here to tear up the holy thread.

17
00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:42.020
It ruined my future.

18
00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:49.160
But his petty tricks are of no value in the face of real power.

19
00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:50.840
You invert black and white

20
00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.340
The ability to change is admirable.

21
00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:01.920
Li Huining, are you really the noble people here who don t see your petty little feelings?

22
00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.260
Ly Van Hieu for so many years

23
00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.620
Are you really trying to understand me?

24
00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:09.520
You are there to blame the world.

25
00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.000
If you hadn't turned your face today

26
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.080
It's not going to happen.

27
00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:13.920
Your name does not reveal your identity.

28
00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.460
You can also enjoy your wealth in the countryside.

29
00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:17.560
But what about now?

30
00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:18.760
You have nothing.

31
00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:19.880
You are also related to literature.

32
00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:20.880
It's connected to my house.

33
00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.860
You should apologize for bowing down to Van Hieu.

34
00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:26.180
Sorry, I gave him everything.

35
00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:27.680
It's him who should apologize.

36
00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:29.632
And the whole family.

37
00:01:29.632 --> 00:01:30.220
Shut up.

38
00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.040
Still not ashamed enough?

39
00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.000
I haven't caught my eye on your little favor yet.

40
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.960
What I get now has nothing to do with you.

41
00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.820
It's from my adoptive mother, the chief princess.

42
00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:43.433
Haha.

43
00:01:43.433 --> 00:01:44.940
Laughing at what?

44
00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.120
I laugh at you in vain.

45
00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:49.720
I laugh at you for being right.

46
00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.700
I laugh that you have eyes that do not know Thai Son.

47
00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:54.940
I laughed at myself too.

48
00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.140
Laughing, I don't know who.

49
00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.640
Can't see through your wolf's heart

50
00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.620
If you want to blame yourself, you can only blame yourself.
