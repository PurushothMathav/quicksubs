00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:01.880
The breath is loud.

2
00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:05.740
A poor woman dared to sit in front of the court minister.

3
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.240
That's bold.

4
00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:08.580
Get out of here!

5
00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:12.600
This seat is for the saint and the princess.

6
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:16.280
You dare to sit, are you not afraid of blasphemy?

7
00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:20.660
Not bad, you can't sit in this position.

8
00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:22.580
It is not that saints today cannot sit.

9
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.940
The princess can't sit.

10
00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.740
How do you know I'm not the one for you to bow to?

11
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.540
Over a thousand people.

12
00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:35.460
Who do you think you are?

13
00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.020
Do you really think you can beat the whole school?

14
00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:40.240
Unrestrained is you.

15
00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:41.340
It's her identity.

16
00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:42.520
You don't deserve to forget the meaning.

17
00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:43.700
You're right.

18
00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.360
I can actually cover the entire audience.

19
00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:47.620
Today's party

20
00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.140
Observe the whole school.

21
00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:50.420
They're all ants.

22
00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:52.900
Ha ha ha

23
00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:54.760
It's lawless.

24
00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:55.960
Nonsense.

25
00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:56.860
Ly Hue Ninh

26
00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.860
I really underestimated it.

27
00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.260
I can't believe you for this scene.

28
00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.320
That's a lot of work down there, isn't it?

29
00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:05.780
Oh, son-in-law.

30
00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:07.200
What does this mean?

31
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.780
She knew that I was married to her husband.

32
00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:12.620
Lying that parents are dead

33
00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.440
She had a plan for all of this.

34
00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.360
She even found the Lord of Heaven as her foundation.

35
00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.140
Just to destroy me.

36
00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.820
If the princess doesn't adopt me,

37
00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.620
You did not make me King of Peace.

38
00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.780
I'm sure that my husband will actually kick me out the door.

39
00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:31.860
On the street.

40
00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.620
The country girl.

41
00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.280
It's great to play like this.

42
00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.820
But God is on my side.

43
00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.700
Next, let's see when you can play.

44
00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:52.380
Li Wenxiao, you have no idea how you are going to win.

45
00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:54.460
That's funny.

46
00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:55.720
Say whatever you want.

47
00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:56.540
Commander

48
00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:58.240
You are the guardian angel.

49
00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:59.840
Important location

50
00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.620
Why follow her to death?

51
00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:06.320
Don't you know that she tore off your holy testament with her own hands?

52
00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:07.700
It's torn.

53
00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.160
How are you?

54
00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.900
She really cheated on you a lot.

55
00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.940
I don't understand.

56
00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.960
Did you see this beautiful village girl?

57
00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:23.740
Ha ha ha ha ha

58
00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:34.480
Dare to say shit again

59
00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.900
It's your head.
