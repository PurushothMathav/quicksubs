00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:02.760
What did the Prime Minister say?

2
00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.500
This mean woman disturbed the coma before you arrived.

3
00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:08.220
And tear up the decree

4
00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:11.260
Humiliate the emperor and princess

5
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.320
It's messy.

6
00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:14.580
It's lawless.

7
00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:16.680
Even though she's his foster mother.

8
00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.120
There's a little grace for the juniors

9
00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:21.480
But she did something wrong. 

10
00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:22.740
There's no respect.

11
00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:26.080
Absolutely don't let the gods here in your eyes.

12
00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:27.380
Touching on public anger.

13
00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.180
She had said many insults to the Holy Father and the Princess.

14
00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:34.300
We advised each other.

15
00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:36.580
But she's stronger.

16
00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.780
You're sitting in a high position in front of this hall.

17
00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:41.760
Claiming to be over 10,000 people.

18
00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.000
That's arrogant.

19
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.480
Even though I'm the adopted daughter of the chief princess

20
00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.720
The King of Peace is chosen by His Majesty.

21
00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:52.180
There is absolutely no tolerance for such a person to ruin our reputation.

22
00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:56.699
To ruin the marriage of the chief princess and the High Priest.

23
00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:56.980
Oh.

24
00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.380
So what are you going to do?

25
00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:03.120
Below self-opinion

26
00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.760
It's King Security.

27
00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:06.460
The gods.

28
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.000
Total number of orders

29
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.380
Destroy the way of life 

30
00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.380
Such a rural woman.

31
00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.600
There must be nothing good about her relatives.

32
00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.600
It should destroy its nine tribes.

33
00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:17.660
One does not leave.

34
00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.580
Just because she doesn't respect you.

35
00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:21.300
It's not too much to die a thousand times.

36
00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:22.440
We cut the way of life.

37
00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.499
That's her luck.

38
00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.820
Okay.

39
00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.780
Okay.

40
00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.460
You guys did great.

41
00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.900
The Prime Minister wrongly praised

42
00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:35.840
I waited to do so purely for the protection of the majesty of the court.

43
00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.660
The Princess's Face

44
00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:39.740
This woman.

45
00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:41.580
Nonsense.

46
00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:43.120
Angry.

47
00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:46.440
If you let her keep talking

48
00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.900
To the ears of the Holy Father and the Princess.

49
00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.820
I see it's you who should kill the Nine Clans.

50
00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:00.140
Prime Minister, Mr.

51
00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:03.780
Save School Canh
