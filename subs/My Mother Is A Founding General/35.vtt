1
00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:02.400
It's just an adopted child.

2
00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:04.300
A small throne.

3
00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:06.480
Let a small person like you succeed.

4
00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.460
You're a piece of mud that can't support a wall.

5
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.240
The chief princess is the founding marshal of our Great Xia.

6
00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:15.140
The heroine can't be doubted.

7
00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.100
The whole House respected her.

8
00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:20.260
We are now the adopted children of the princess.

9
00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:23.000
Over time to position the official weight

10
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.340
Under one thousand people.

11
00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:28.900
Jen, why are you saying this to a village girl?

12
00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.000
She's never been to the village gate.

13
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.320
I'm afraid she thinks the village chief is the emperor.

14
00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.740
Ha ha ha ha ha

15
00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:41.100
Maybe she knows Liu Xiang, and her ancestral grave is smoking green.

16
00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.260
Ha ha ha ha ha

17
00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:47.300
Power is like a cloud of smoke

18
00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:48.620
Won today.

19
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.380
Sparkling into bubbles

20
00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.620
Everyone knows the princess's reputation.

21
00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:58.599
But I don't know if the princess is a loyal person.

22
00:00:58.599 --> 00:01:00.660
Not a bully.

23
00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.640
What you did today.

24
00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.500
It will soon make you regret it.

25
00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:09.560
Ly Van Hieu

26
00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.660
I'll tell you what regret is.

27
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.680
When you die, you're still pretending.

28
00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.000
You really don't know how many pens a dead letter has.

29
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.260
Someone held her back for me.

30
00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.420
Let him get up my ass.

31
00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:26.280
Then beat him to death.

32
00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.620
Pull out to feed the dog.

33
00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:28.199
Animals 

34
00:01:28.199 --> 00:01:31.360
For the sake of the woman who raised you for 20 years.

35
00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.040
Leave you a few faces.

36
00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.940
But what you did today didn't deserve to be human.

37
00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:37.560
I absolutely can't forgive you.

38
00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:38.099
Canh School

39
00:01:38.099 --> 00:01:41.060
Why be angry with this clown?

40
00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:42.160
Take an order.

41
00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.900
Remove the identity of Princess Ly Van Hieu

42
00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.220
Take away his pride.

43
00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:50.632
The peaceful king.

44
00:01:50.632 --> 00:01:51.033
Yes.

45
00:01:51.033 --> 00:01:52.220
Ly Hue Ninh

46
00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:53.960
Who do you think you are?

47
00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:55.932
I am the adopted son of the chief princess.

48
00:01:55.932 --> 00:01:58.720
You call yourself the King of Peace.

49
00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:00.900
Why did you cancel my identity?

50
00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.160
Even if he's the prime minister.

51
00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:05.140
He couldn't touch me either.

52
00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:08.200
Later before speaking out loud.

53
00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:12.420
Consider how many pounds you end up weighing.

54
00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:18.640
Go.

55
00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.933
I want to see it today.

56
00:02:52.933 --> 00:02:56.020
Who can cast me away
