00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:04.900
Why are you afraid?

2
00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:09.660
I'll be afraid of you.

3
00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:11.340
I will

4
00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:13.500
Let's wait and see.

5
00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:18.020
Ladies and gentlemen.

6
00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:20.800
Our power is tied together.

7
00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.360
Extensive root system

8
00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:25.666
I don't believe in such a rural woman.

9
00:00:25.666 --> 00:00:27.600
You can't even turn the sky.

10
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:28.420
Ly Van Hieu

11
00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.000
You're too confident.

12
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.660
The king is the adopted son of the chief princess.

13
00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.140
Be confident.

14
00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:36.860
Is there anything?

15
00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.260
Ha ha ha

16
00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.560
The general had drowned for more than half his life.

17
00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:45.420
In the end not as strong as a determined young man.

18
00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.020
Haha ha, Liu Truong Canh is the Prime Minister.

19
00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:51.460
It doesn't stop us from waiting relatively hard.

20
00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.500
I have a princess standing next to me.

21
00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:57.820
Even to the emperor.

22
00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:59.520
Go to the princess.

23
00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.760
We are as stable as the mountain.

24
00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.620
You can try it.

25
00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.560
Master Liu has arrived at this time.

26
00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.500
You're protecting this bastard.

27
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.480
You are the Prime Minister of the current dynasty.

28
00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:12.300
respect the court.

29
00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:13.920
Respecting Your Majesty

30
00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.660
You're very protective of this rural woman.

31
00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.720
If this gets out,

32
00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.160
What will Your Majesty think?

33
00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.620
What would the princess think?

34
00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.500
Ha ha ha ha

35
00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:27.560
What does that have to do with you?

36
00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:28.360
You.

37
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.533
I don't know life and death.

38
00:01:30.533 --> 00:01:30.900
Wow.

39
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.300
Full of courtiers.

40
00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:36.520
Bullying me, a rural woman

41
00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:39.180
Your Majesty and the Princess know.

42
00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.200
How will I look at you?

43
00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:42.000
Ly Hue Ninh

44
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.040
I see because you and Master Liu have known each other for a while.

45
00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:48.020
Don't pursue your bragging.

46
00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:50.560
But if you keep on being arrogant

47
00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:51.940
Whether it's Liu Xiang

48
00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:53.620
It can't protect you either.

49
00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.260
The Susan River

50
00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.220
What do you mean?

51
00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.420
Lord Liu.

52
00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:02.840
He protected this village woman for no reason.

53
00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.800
Enemy of the court.

54
00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.660
I didn't ask you what you meant.

55
00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:09.180
Father-in-law.

56
00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.900
In my opinion.

57
00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.620
Master Liu must have been blinded by her.

58
00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.320
I'll stand up for her.

59
00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:18.300
But these two are about the same age.

60
00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.160
Maybe.

61
00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.360
There was a story before.

62
00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.820
Ha ha ha

63
00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:27.820
Presumptuous.

64
00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:31.460
Lady's grace recreated with the duty

65
00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.180
The nine deaths are difficult to repay.

66
00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.940
But this official is not without reason to help.

67
00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:44.860
Wait a minute, I can talk nonsense.

68
00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.300
You're welcome.
