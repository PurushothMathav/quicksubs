00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.300
Your mother has come to visit you.

2
00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.320
This is my own tofu brain.

3
00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:07.760
And your favorite pickle.

4
00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:08.520
Where's your house?

5
00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:09.640
I put it down for you.

6
00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:10.480
Why are you here?

7
00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:12.500
Didn't you receive the letter I wrote you?

8
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:13.960
I see it.

9
00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:15.520
Something as big as marriage.

10
00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:17.340
How could you not come?

11
00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:18.599
Not Mom.

12
00:00:18.599 --> 00:00:19.260
Van Hieu

13
00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:24.820
Van Hieu, who's here?

14
00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.640
No one is a bad beggar.

15
00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:28.840
I'll fire him.

16
00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:30.080
You're waiting for me inside.

17
00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:31.320
I'll be right back.

18
00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.180
What?

19
00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.980
Mom, what's going on?

20
00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:38.700
The smelly beggar

21
00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:40.300
It's disgusting.

22
00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.460
Why don't you let me in?

23
00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:51.080
They say I'm a beggar.

24
00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:52.200
What do you mean?

25
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.000
Mom, I'll take you home first.

26
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.860
Can I explain it to you then?

27
00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.140
I'm not going, you explain it to me clearly.

28
00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.620
Mom, I use the excuse of suffering.

29
00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:04.740
What could be the reason you don't even recognize you as a mother?

30
00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.460
Did I in your heart shame you so much?

31
00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.200
Mom, it's all the baby's fault.

32
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.080
You've worked hard to raise your children.

33
00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:19.660
Let children learn

34
00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.420
Reduce your life expectancy by 20 years to change your life.

35
00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:24.400
I'm useless.

36
00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.320
The baby couldn't stand the city of Kyoto.

37
00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:27.600
They're all useless children.

38
00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.460
They're useless children.

39
00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.160
Van Hieu, wake up.

40
00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:34.700
Something to say for good.

41
00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:36.200
I'm not angry anymore.

42
00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.300
You tell your mother

43
00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:38.760
What's going on?

44
00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:40.540
Mom, it's very unpleasant in my heart.

45
00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.080
Mom, I didn't mean to say that.

46
00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:47.720
The child initially wanted to be a human.

47
00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.700
Then the beautiful scenery welcomes you to the city to enjoy.

48
00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.580
This world is hard.

49
00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.160
The baby couldn't do it.

50
00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.380
I didn't mean to hide your identity.

51
00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.740
My family is a big family in the city.

52
00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.860
Yen Nhi's father was a powerful general.

53
00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:03.920
If they know your existence.

54
00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.000
They definitely won't let Yen Nhi marry me.

55
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.020
Mom, can you understand me?

56
00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:10.660
So what did you tell the family?

57
00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.900
Still say

58
00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:15.340
Say what?

59
00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.740
The baby is

60
00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:19.760
Both my parents are dead.

61
00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:20.660
It's an orphan.
