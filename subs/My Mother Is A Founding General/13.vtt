00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:08.640
From now on

2
00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:11.000
I'm just the son-in-law of the Su family.

3
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.340
It has nothing to do with you.

4
00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:15.460
Cut your hair.

5
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.980
Good.

6
00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:22.040
I've been raising a good son for 20 years.

7
00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:23.980
For a family.

8
00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.740
They want to cut off their relationship with me.

9
00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.580
It's really the most amazing thing in the world.

10
00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:31.340
I'm Ly Huining.

11
00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:34.460
How can you raise a child who is not so good?

12
00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.340
It's just a house.

13
00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.580
Do you know what the city s status is?

14
00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:44.200
General Su is the captain of the princess.

15
00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:47.940
Family Su in your mouth is the support that how many people dream of?

16
00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:51.340
You're just a rude country woman.

17
00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:53.020
You know what?

18
00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.840
The princess's body was strong.

19
00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.980
This is what you want, right?

20
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.140
Yes, I'll satisfy you.

21
00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:08.380
Don't regret it later.

22
00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:14.500
You were raised by me.

23
00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:15.940
The gift of longevity.

24
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.260
I'm not begging you to cut me back.

25
00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.980
Now you kneel down and knock three heads for me.

26
00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:24.260
We clean up.

27
00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:27.320
You messed up my wedding.

28
00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.060
You want me to kneel over your head?

29
00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.060
I think you should get down on your knees and blow my head off.

30
00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.080
I read the grace of raising your children

31
00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:37.140
Don t be afraid to throw it out for the dog to eat.

32
00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:39.360
Just beat you to death.

33
00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.820
Leave you a full corpse

34
00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.020
My good son.

35
00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.300
I have been raising you for 20 years.

36
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.680
You want me to bow down to you.

37
00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.160
They want to beat me to death.

38
00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:52.420
Not leaving the whole body.

39
00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.100
Haha.

40
00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:56.940
Forgetting the Ancestors

41
00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:58.500
Great disobedience

42
00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:00.720
What are you standing there for?

43
00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.160
Keep her for me.

44
00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:03.620
Beat to death

45
00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:06.680
That's rubbish.

46
00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:07.366
Let me.

47
00:02:07.366 --> 00:02:08.420
Ly Van Hieu

48
00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:10.240
You're my son.

49
00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:11.560
My son killed my mother.

50
00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:12.820
Lightning strike

51
00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.233
Haha, then today I'll watch me beat you to death.

52
00:02:18.233 --> 00:02:20.620
Can God beat me?

53
00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.500
The saint just arrived.
