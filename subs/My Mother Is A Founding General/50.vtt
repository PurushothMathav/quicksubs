00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.440
Long live the emperor!

2
00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:09.333
Love In The World

3
00:00:10.333 --> 00:00:10.860
Thank you, Your Majesty.

4
00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.140
I have two things to say to you guys today.

5
00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.860
The first of these was that the princess officially announced her return to North Korea.

6
00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:22.520
The whole country is celebrating.

7
00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:23.840
The Princess is Back

8
00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:25.740
We are never welcome.

9
00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:27.488
It's worth dying for.

10
00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:29.820
It's okay.

11
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.460
This second thing.

12
00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.940
I'm very sick.

13
00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:37.780
There's not much time left.

14
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.980
You can't go a day without an army.

15
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.300
And I don't have children.

16
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.300
I am determined to let the princess succeed to the throne.

17
00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:51.740
Effective today.

18
00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:53.080
Princess Chief

19
00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.600
Princess to the throne

20
00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.040
This has never happened before.

21
00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:00.320
Isn't this an opportunity for us to rise?

22
00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:01.980
All right. All right.

23
00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:03.960
Princess Heir to Dai Bao

24
00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.740
So I can go one step further.

25
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.620
It's good, Van Hieu is the adopted son of the chief princess.

26
00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.500
Eventually, they will be able to raise the boat.

27
00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.700
Maybe.

28
00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.100
Don't we have a chance to be queen?

29
00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.260
Princess to the throne

30
00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.740
I've never heard of the princess having children.

31
00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.580
That's not to say I can.

32
00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.620
I could be the next king.
