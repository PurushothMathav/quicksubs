00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:01.440
Ha ha ha

2
00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:03.720
It makes people laugh their teeth off.

3
00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.000
Did I beg her to give it to me?

4
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.400
The throne.

5
00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:12.460
All my glory is the favor of Your Majesty and the Princess.

6
00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:15.340
What does that have to do with her?

7
00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:16.320
Wow.

8
00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.840
What an order.

9
00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.420
Everything you think you have.

10
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.080
Is it just because of grace?

11
00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.399
No.

12
00:00:24.399 --> 00:00:28.200
You have her in the back helping you.

13
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.260
You've got everything today.

14
00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:33.300
And today if you don't stop at the cliff

15
00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:35.340
Later only regret.

16
00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:41.260
Li Wenxiao, do you want a path to the dark?

17
00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.180
That's funny.

18
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.700
Just relying on him is just a rural woman.

19
00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.480
Can you grant me the throne of peace?

20
00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.020
Can you give me this glory?

21
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.460
I don't know what kind of personal relationship you two have.

22
00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:56.880
But what happened today...

23
00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:59.860
I will report honestly to God.

24
00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:01.640
The Princess Report

25
00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.300
Then I'll see what you do.

26
00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:08.840
Good words are hard to advise.

27
00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.200
Fucking man.

28
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.100
Let's not talk to him anymore.

29
00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:16.780
Now Van Hieu is coming.

30
00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:20.120
The emperor's dragon chariot and the chief princess's phoenix chariot will arrive at any time.

31
00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:22.420
She's crazy here to hurt us.

32
00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:24.100
Li Huining.

33
00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:26.600
I can read about old love.

34
00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.800
May God and the princess spare your life.

35
00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.480
But if you dare to meddle in my affairs.

36
00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:35.220
Don't blame me for not remembering my ex.

37
00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:37.760
Let me live.

38
00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:41.080
Yes, I'm the adopted daughter of the princess.

39
00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:44.060
Maybe the princess will give me this face.

40
00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.100
But if you kneel down now...

41
00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.420
Send me Mr. Wei

42
00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:52.900
Apologize to the leaders present.

43
00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.260
I will.

44
00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:56.260
Spare your life.

45
00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:02.860
Li Wenxiao, do you think you are being gracious?

46
00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.260
You only use power to oppress.

47
00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.020
Just protesting with me.

48
00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.540
I've been raising you for over 20 years.

49
00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.380
Plus 20 years of my life.

50
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.860
In exchange for such an outcome.

51
00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:17.600
It's a shame.

52
00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.580
You don't know you'll give up

53
00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:22.780
What kind of existence?

54
00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:26.660
And my life.

55
00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:33.260
I'm sitting here.

56
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.300
I'll see.

57
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.660
Who Dares to Take It
