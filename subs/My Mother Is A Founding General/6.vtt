1
00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:09.340
Get out.

2
00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:22.680
The money was carried away by the guards.

3
00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.120
Hello, Princess.

4
00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:26.500
Hello, Princess.

5
00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:27.660
Stand up.

6
00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:29.766
Princess Chief

7
00:00:29.766 --> 00:00:32.020
Do you need the Royal Family's help?

8
00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:34.260
Van Hieu started his career

9
00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:35.620
It's immature.

10
00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.940
A small second-rate family of the Su family could also make him feel ashamed.

11
00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:41.500
Let go of dignity

12
00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.940
I'm really ashamed.

13
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.580
Tomorrow is the wedding of Van Hieu and To Yen Nhi.

14
00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:50.300
Tell Li the People for me.

15
00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.660
The palace wants to return to the position of the chief princess.

16
00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.400
Welcome back to the Princess.

17
00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.260
Welcome back to the Princess.

18
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.080
Tomorrow I want you to bring the holy thread to the Su house.

19
00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.740
Let Van Hieu be adopted by the chief princess, the royal son.

20
00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.700
Beautiful family.

21
00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:14.700
Right.

22
00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.820
The Lord of Heaven really said that.

23
00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:26.220
Your Majesty.

24
00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:28.040
These are the Princess's words.

25
00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:29.060
Really.

26
00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.680
That's great.

27
00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:32.840
The Princess is Back

28
00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.320
It's Your Majesty's luck.

29
00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.800
Big summer.

30
00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:36.620
Your Majesty.

31
00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.540
The Princess once said

32
00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.840
She wanted to return this time because Prince Ly Van Hieu spread a glorious road.

33
00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.820
Show royal prestige

34
00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:51.520
Her Majesty, the princess, for saving her adopted son Ly Van Hieu, did not regret changing her life.

35
00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.240
20 years service life

36
00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.460
It can be seen that the princess takes this adoption very seriously.

37
00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.500
Good sister has no children.

38
00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.440
Her adopted son is my nephew.

39
00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.580
No matter how I treat him, it's not too much.

40
00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:08.940
My legacy

41
00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:12.840
Donate Princess Ly Van Hieu An Ninh to the throne

42
00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.200
The wedding of Ly Van Hieu To's daughter

43
00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.880
Prepare to add a gift of the highest specifications of the royal

44
00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.820
I want to go to my own house to propose.

45
00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.460
Make this wedding the biggest festival in Beijing

46
00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.660
My order.

47
00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:37.700
Mrs. Hoang

48
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.420
There are friends here.

49
00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.180
The Lord is not worried.
