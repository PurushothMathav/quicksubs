00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:02.120
Why do I have to run?

2
00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:05.120
Aren't you going to run away and die here?

3
00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:06.499
What do you think?

4
00:00:06.499 --> 00:00:12.580
Only relying on the Ten Thousand Axles and the Six Kingdoms can protect you under the wrath of God.

5
00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:18.160
Don't joke, the crimes you committed are all major crimes of killing the Nine Nations. 

6
00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:21.460
Taking out any of them can kill you 10,000 times.

7
00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:25.460
Why do we need someone else to protect us?

8
00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:26.700
The story comes now

9
00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.340
Dare to talk freely

10
00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:30.600
Are those words?

11
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.900
You'll know later.

12
00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.580
Li Huining, you are too confident.

13
00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.280
The general doesn't know what he has to rely on.

14
00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.640
But this is the palace.

15
00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:43.720
Can't let you be presumptuous.

16
00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:45.600
If I dare to stand here

17
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.920
Of course we rely on it.

18
00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.220
You think power can cover the sky.

19
00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.740
Who knows the will of God is unpredictable?

20
00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.732
I'm going to show you today.

21
00:00:57.732 --> 00:00:59.980
What is real power?

22
00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:02.140
It's a real power.

23
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.640
There are such arrogant people under the sun.

24
00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.780
I really don't know how high the sky is.

25
00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.920
To Gia To Son River

26
00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:11.040
Meet through Master Qin

27
00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.220
Meet Master Qin

28
00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:13.740
Meet Master Qin

29
00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.680
See you later.

30
00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:16.966
Master Qin

31
00:01:16.966 --> 00:01:18.260
Free of charge

32
00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:20.640
Let me introduce you.

33
00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.466
This is the son of Zhen Quoc Cong.

34
00:01:22.466 --> 00:01:24.740
General Qin's favorite son, Qin Tianxiao.

35
00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.820
Identity is precious.

36
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.020
This is my son-in-law, Ly Van Hieu.

37
00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:32.600
He is also the adopted son of the princess.

38
00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.820
The King of Security whom the Emperor appointed

39
00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.740
Oh, you're the new adopted daughter of the chief princess.

40
00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:40.500
Of course you are a martial artist.

41
00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.800
Your Highness, the Chief Princess, and I, the Qin family, have the grace to recreate

42
00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.980
I will be your brother from now on.

43
00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:47.920
Helped by the Royal Princess

44
00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:49.480
Van Hieu did not dare

45
00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:51.560
How dare you make friends with Master Qin?

46
00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.500
Hum, that's it.

47
00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.200
All of the young men said that.

48
00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:57.700
Don't refuse.

49
00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.666
The old General Qin has a child.

50
00:01:59.666 --> 00:02:01.780
For Qin lack is the most extraordinary concern.

51
00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.100
Later you have to walk more.

52
00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.020
Mom said,

53
00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:07.280
In that case.

54
00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.280
The other brother Qin paid homage without obeying orders.

55
00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.860
Mr. Li is really happy.

56
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.860
Stop!

57
00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.860
If the young master remembers correctly.

58
00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.380
That was bullshit.
