00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.040
You don't have to serve anyone.

2
00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:03.240
Who are you?

3
00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:04.620
About our family.

4
00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:06.060
It's your turn to step in.

5
00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:06.966
I am...

6
00:00:06.966 --> 00:00:08.260
She she she is

7
00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:11.940
This voice is familiar.

8
00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:15.020
Was he the one who came to the door yesterday?

9
00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:18.780
Yes, yes, yes, it was the smelly beggar who came to the house asking for rice yesterday.

10
00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:21.940
Why does the smell call flowers here?

11
00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.740
Will you come to my house for lunch?

12
00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:25.220
Very brave.

13
00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:27.560
Today is the wedding day.

14
00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:28.580
Don't use force.

15
00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.400
It's okay for beggars to stick to the fun atmosphere.

16
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:34.280
Someone took her to the kitchen.

17
00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.980
So that no outsider will say that we are stingy.

18
00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:38.980
My father-in-law is right.

19
00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:40.700
Go.

20
00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.060
I'm not a beggar.

21
00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.400
I'm here to beg for food.

22
00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.160
Do you still want the money?

23
00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.400
Today is my wedding.

24
00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:49.680
I satisfy you

25
00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.540
But after you get the money, you've got to go.

26
00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:57.920
I'm going to kick her out right now.

27
00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:58.466
Hurry up.

28
00:00:58.466 --> 00:01:00.240
Don't delay your wedding with Nicky.

29
00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:02.580
How to talk to a smelly beggar?

30
00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.140
Why don't you go?

31
00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:07.180
Even if it's from our house.

32
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.380
There must be degrees.

33
00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.480
Mrs. Su, even though she is Van Hieu's mother-in-law.

34
00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:21.020
But you shouldn't treat him like a servant.

35
00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.820
Drink up.

36
00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:24.980
Van Hieu is the son-in-law of the To family.

37
00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:28.040
What does what we do with him have to do with you?

38
00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:29.940
He came to marry your daughter.

39
00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:31.960
Not to be a horse.

40
00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:32.760
Wow.

41
00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:34.960
You may not get married.

42
00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.220
A lowlife from the remote countryside

43
00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:38.920
What is the right to marry my daughter?

44
00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:40.200
It's also his life.

45
00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.060
When I met our family, Yen Nhi came to the house to be a fat son-in-law.

46
00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:46.966
Son-in-law

47
00:01:46.966 --> 00:01:49.020
The man came home.

48
00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:50.460
Ten Unfortunate Nine Kisses

49
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.840
Better to be poor.

50
00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.420
No door.

51
00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:55.660
Ly Van Hieu

52
00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:57.600
You read poetry.

53
00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:58.940
You are full of experience.

54
00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.300
How can you voluntarily fall?

55
00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:02.700
Son-in-law

56
00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:03.599
Who are you?

57
00:02:03.599 --> 00:02:06.540
A smelly beggar came to our house asking for rice.

58
00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.000
In what capacity to say

59
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.380
My husband threw her out for me.

60
00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.020
This little thing doesn't work very well.

61
00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:13.340
That's rubbish.

62
00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:16.280
Excuse me.

63
00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.060
You are now

64
00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.380
Sorry Van Hieu
