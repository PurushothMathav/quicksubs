00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.560
Queen, I was wrong.

2
00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:03.699
I really know I'm wrong.

3
00:00:03.699 --> 00:00:05.480
Can you give me one more chance?

4
00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:06.280
Mom.

5
00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:08.500
The house is right.

6
00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:10.580
It's all the family's fault.

7
00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:12.260
It's all for my family.

8
00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:14.820
Otherwise I wouldn't have come this far.

9
00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:18.980
Mom, I'm going to cut ties with the Su family right now.

10
00:00:20.233 --> 00:00:22.133
It's all because of you.

11
00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:23.360
Ly Van Hieu

12
00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.100
What are you doing?

13
00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:27.420
It's all because of your Su family.

14
00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:31.080
If not for your family.

15
00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.720
I'm not going this far.

16
00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:33.600
Ly Van Hieu

17
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.480
You ungrateful little animal.

18
00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:36.580
You let go of Yen Nhi.

19
00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.560
If you don't lick your face begging

20
00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:40.280
How can I agree to this marriage?

21
00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.560
It's all because of this little animal.

22
00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:45.520
If it wasn't for you constantly humiliating your mother

23
00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:48.060
How can we blame the princess?

24
00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.780
It's all your own doing.

25
00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:51.880
Can't blame us.

26
00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:53.880
You talk nonsense that has nothing to do with me.

27
00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.520
I'm not wrong. It's all your fault.

28
00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:57.540
That's enough.

29
00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:00.500
What you're doing.

30
00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:03.020
It just makes me feel nauseous.

31
00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.460
You're my fault.
