1
00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.120
The Wei Gong is the General Manager

2
00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:05.433
Can't you even get on your knees?

3
00:00:05.433 --> 00:00:05.980
Not enough.

4
00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:09.980
I am the court proclaiming the high priest

5
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.600
Are you eligible?

6
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:12.560
Not enough.

7
00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:15.780
So what about plus I'm minister of etiquette?

8
00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.320
It's not enough.

9
00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.140
Interestingly, two three-volume books are not qualified.

10
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:27.140
Then what about this second-generation Quang Loc grandmaster and crown prince who lacks the right to say huh?

11
00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:31.020
It's much longer.

12
00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.480
Li Huining, you really don't know how to live and die.

13
00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.900
Don t you know that these four people are all royal officials?

14
00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.580
They can cut off your life and death with a single word.

15
00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:45.820
You have broken this order.

16
00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.180
Do you want to break through the sky?

17
00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:49.820
So what?

18
00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.620
Aren t you going to get down on your knees and apologize to the Wei Gong and these three masters?

19
00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.100
I told you.

20
00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.860
They.

21
00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:01.599
It's not worth it.

22
00:01:01.599 --> 00:01:02.600
You're crazy.

23
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.080
You want to die, die yourself.

24
00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.400
Don't worry about our house, there's our house.

25
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:07.740
In that case.

26
00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.380
Then add to this the chief princess under General To Son Ha here.

27
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.280
General under your princess.

28
00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:24.060
Not bad, Wei Gong just said that my Su family is getting married today.

29
00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.560
The saints will come and see.

30
00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.460
Even the chief princess who had retired for many years would personally visit.

31
00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.100
It's an honor.

32
00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:33.540
There's no need to tell.

33
00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.880
Haha ha, my Su family will face the chief princess and take a step to the sky.

34
00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.940
Enjoy the honor.

35
00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:44.720
Do you think that's enough now?

36
00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.440
What is the river you are?

37
00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.080
Well worth facing the big princess

38
00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:49.366
You.

39
00:01:49.366 --> 00:01:53.100
General To was a general under the chief princess.

40
00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.200
Now married to the chief princess.

41
00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.100
How not to face

42
00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.400
A rural woman can't touch

43
00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.640
How can you understand the power of the princess?

44
00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.520
That's the saint today.

45
00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.100
The Grand Marshal founded the entire dynasty.

46
00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:10.420
Humiliate the Chief Princess

47
00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.740
That is the great crime of killing the Nine Clans.

48
00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:13.600
Hum.

49
00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:15.700
I know.

50
00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:17.920
Right now.

51
00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.660
You all want to take me down.

52
00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.020
Be good in front of the lady in your mouth.

53
00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:25.660
But...

54
00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:27.700
Excuse me.

55
00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:30.340
You're not qualified.

56
00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.340
All right.

57
00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.440
Look all summer.

58
00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.860
He was the first to dare to speak to the highest authority.

59
00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:49.420
Li Huining, you are really looking for death.

60
00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.840
I'm glad I drew a line with you.

61
00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.520
You will be killed sooner or later.

62
00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:56.800
If you want to fight me.

63
00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:58.700
We must face the Great Depression.

64
00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:01.999
Then I will fulfill your vanity.

65
00:03:01.999 --> 00:03:02.580
Go.

66
00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:09.860
Break his leg for me.

67
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.640
Let's see who dares to fight the princess.

68
00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:15.080
This bone.

69
00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:17.140
How hard is it?

70
00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:18.980
I'll see who dares.

71
00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.220
What's he doing here?

72
00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:31.500
Short knowledge

73
00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:33.860
Lonely.

74
00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:37.380
Do you know who she is?
