00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:06.840
Dad, you're here.

2
00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:07.920
If you don't come anymore

3
00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:10.060
They'll ride on my head.

4
00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:12.180
You have to be my boss.

5
00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:15.340
Who is so bold?

6
00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.280
How dare you do that to me?

7
00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:19.540
That's their school.

8
00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:21.760
Don't just humiliate me in public and hit me in the face

9
00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:23.100
Humiliating you in public.

10
00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:24.880
Say that even when you're here

11
00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:25.980
He's not wrong either.

12
00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:28.620
He wouldn't let our Qin family in his eyes.

13
00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:30.580
Really.

14
00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.020
Really.

15
00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:33.920
My son is willing to testify for you.

16
00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.680
At the end of General To Son Ha willing to testify to Qin young master

17
00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.480
What happened last night we all saw it in our eyes.

18
00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.240
Qin Shao is really innocent, and I hope the Zhen Quoc Duong knows.

19
00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:45.100
Dad, you're not lying to me, are you?

20
00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:48.620
Okay, a sitting prime minister.

21
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.780
Now you're not even putting Ben in your eye, are you?

22
00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:54.780
General Qin

23
00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.560
Officials know you're not easy to get a son

24
00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:59.080
Will pamper

25
00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:00.200
But your godson has no way.

26
00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:01.600
Your son bumped into the gentleman.

27
00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.160
What can I do to help you discipline your son?

28
00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:07.180
What about the old man's son being a little arrogant?

29
00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.100
Is it your turn to repair?

30
00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.500
Why are you a civil servant?

31
00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.900
Do you want to climb on the old man's head?

32
00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.780
He can't be disciplined.

33
00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.180
Then let me handle it. 

34
00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:21.032
What are you?

35
00:01:21.032 --> 00:01:21.220
You.

36
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:24.820
What?

37
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.980
Don't we deserve to discipline him?
