00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:04.300
Why is it so urgent?

2
00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:06.660
Send a message with an arrow

3
00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:08.900
This is the arrow of the Great Wall.

4
00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:10.560
Didn't he go to the temple?

5
00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:12.060
Did something happen to the government?

6
00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:14.900
Immediately send the Musketeers with me to the Kingdom.

7
00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.680
Your Majesty, foreign ambassadors are coming.

8
00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.760
Not because of the private scrap fee that provides, if the delay means peace.

9
00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.060
My summer is in danger.

10
00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:28.040
Luu Ai Khanh is right.

11
00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:29.760
We should value national affairs.

12
00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.820
Then let Liu Ai Khanh take a trip for me.

13
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.040
You have to go to the cave within a few feet.

14
00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:35.900
Remember to meet that person.

15
00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:37.380
Don't ever neglect

16
00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.180
God obeys orders.

17
00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:42.980
Excuse me, Your Majesty.

18
00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.900
Why care about a small family?

19
00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.260
The first marriage.

20
00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:49.660
Then put the holy thread again.

21
00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.660
This is not an honor that the government should have.

22
00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:54.940
All for one person.

23
00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.099
Alone.

24
00:00:56.099 --> 00:00:56.466
Right.

25
00:00:56.466 --> 00:00:58.320
One for you.

26
00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.260
There is grace for me.

27
00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:04.560
Your time is up.

28
00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:05.360
Wow.

29
00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.140
This is your last chance.

30
00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.420
You should still respect it.

31
00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:14.540
Everyone here is a judge.

32
00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:16.900
Where you need support from others

33
00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:17.832
More than that.

34
00:01:17.832 --> 00:01:22.740
There is also the adopted daughter of the chief princess, King An Ninh.

35
00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.240
A native.

36
00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.680
It's just not good or bad.

37
00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.220
I have advised you to leave.

38
00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.540
You must stay here and die.

39
00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.080
All right.

40
00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.840
Fortunately, you can cut off your mother s relationship first.

41
00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.220
If it is no longer connected to our house.

42
00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:39.460
I really don't know how to live and die.

43
00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:42.599
Gentlemen, today I am the adopted daughter of the chief princess.

44
00:01:42.599 --> 00:01:45.480
Your Majesty personally created the identity of King An Ninh.

45
00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.760
Call on you to make an announcement.

46
00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:48.920
City announcement

47
00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:50.120
Cut off her life.

48
00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:51.540
Police Academy
