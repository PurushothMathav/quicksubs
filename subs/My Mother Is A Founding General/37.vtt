00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:02.020
How is that possible?

2
00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:04.400
This is your ingratitude.

3
00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:06.280
The End of Betrayal

4
00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:07.260
How is that possible?

5
00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:08.866
I am the Holy One now.

6
00:00:08.866 --> 00:00:11.760
He himself canonized the adopted son of the chief princess An Ninh.

7
00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:13.440
How could it be because of one of her words?

8
00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.120
Your Majesty has usurped my throne.

9
00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.740
What the hell is this?

10
00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:18.840
What tricks does a bad woman use?

11
00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.340
They can remove the throne.

12
00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:23.940
It must be you.

13
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.020
Save School Canh

14
00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.560
Your hands are too long, right?

15
00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.632
Always against me for this village woman.

16
00:00:30.632 --> 00:00:30.900
Yes.

17
00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.260
I just said that.

18
00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:38.780
Dare to say nonsense again

19
00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:40.540
Humiliate the lady.

20
00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:43.232
This official will not forgive.

21
00:00:43.232 --> 00:00:43.660
You.

22
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.866
Wow.

23
00:00:44.866 --> 00:00:46.580
Dad.

24
00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.720
If Van Hieu did not have the chief princess's son

25
00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:51.400
There is no identity of the King of Security.

26
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:52.540
What's going on?

27
00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:53.766
It's all you.

28
00:00:53.766 --> 00:00:55.640
If not for you to stimulate the school.

29
00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.500
How could he take away your throne?

30
00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:00.999
Mom, you're blaming me.

31
00:01:00.999 --> 00:01:02.300
Don't call me mom.

32
00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:04.680
If you're still the adopted daughter of the chief princess

33
00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.360
I can still recognize your son-in-law.

34
00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.720
Now, the Holy Father has ordered the abdication of your throne.

35
00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:09.560
You have nothing.

36
00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:10.540
Failure.

37
00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.640
What is your capacity as the son-in-law of my lord?

38
00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.100
Even being a son-in-law isn't worth it.

39
00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:15.966
Mistake

40
00:01:15.966 --> 00:01:18.060
You're a villain.

41
00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:20.460
It's impossible.

42
00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:21.660
It's absolutely impossible.

43
00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:25.999
How could you listen to him?

44
00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:27.700
And take away my throne.

45
00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.340
Van Hieu, what do you mean?

46
00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:31.299
No.

47
00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:32.580
There's a problem.

48
00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:34.260
There must be a problem inside.

49
00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:36.240
Place an order

50
00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:37.940
Decree

51
00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:38.966
Right.

52
00:01:38.966 --> 00:01:41.020
Their news is all fake.
