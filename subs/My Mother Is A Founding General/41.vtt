1
00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:01.300
Unexpected.

2
00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:04.040
We can have a wedding at the palace.

3
00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:06.840
What a wonderful place to be.

4
00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:09.100
Thank you.

5
00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.320
Later, because your mother said that half of your match was not.

6
00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:12.520
Then it thundered.

7
00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:13.700
You can't die.

8
00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:17.240
Congratulations, Master To.

9
00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:19.780
Today your family can marry the royal family.

10
00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.200
This is glory.

11
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:23.560
Ha ha ha

12
00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.500
Master Zhou is so complimentary.

13
00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.980
This is all the work of the son-in-law.

14
00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:31.160
Of course, there is no escaping your support and love.

15
00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.660
Haha, the son-in-law is like that.

16
00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:36.360
The glory of flowers is near.

17
00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.520
Your Majesty personally ordered the marriage in the palace.

18
00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:43.500
You can see that Your Majesty and the Princess hold the Su family in high regard.

19
00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:45.420
Look from the side

20
00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:48.860
Luu Truong Canh is really a hypocritical saint

21
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.280
There's no motive.

22
00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:50.699
Good.

23
00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:53.600
We must severely punish traitors like Liu Truong Canh.

24
00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:54.640
To be a mirror. 

25
00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.460
And that rural woman is Ly Huining.

26
00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.720
Take away the holy precept and open the sin of the king of peace.

27
00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:02.420
When killing nine tribes

28
00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.220
Ha ha ha ha ha

29
00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.700
Talk in the palace.

30
00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.980
You are not afraid of the wind flashing your tongue.

31
00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.900
You're so brave.

32
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.120
I thought you ran away.

33
00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:24.200
I can't believe you came here.

34
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.820
I should praise you for being brave.

35
00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.020
Still don't know life and death.
