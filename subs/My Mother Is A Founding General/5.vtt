00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:01.080
Confused

2
00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:04.480
You're my fault.

3
00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:05.600
It's my fault.

4
00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.580
There's really no new way for kids to make this decision.

5
00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.720
Ten years of cold windows no one asked

6
00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:13.260
Once married, the world knows.

7
00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:14.960
What about the royal inspection?

8
00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:16.600
Above that court.

9
00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.840
No family, no foundation.

10
00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.180
The baby is difficult.

11
00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:23.140
This world is important.

12
00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:26.100
Doing well is harder.

13
00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.300
Like a child

14
00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.340
Who in the city dares to marry a son?

15
00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.700
I struggled to catch up with Nhi.

16
00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:35.040
This is my big opportunity.

17
00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.360
Mom, I really can't tell you the truth.

18
00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.080
Jen's father also told me.

19
00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:40.720
After I married Yen Nhi

20
00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:43.420
He will arrange for me a seven-rank position.

21
00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.420
Seven products, ma'am.

22
00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:49.420
I'm a minor, sesame is just nine products.

23
00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:51.960
Failure is just the beginning.

24
00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.600
I have the support of my father-in-law.

25
00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.060
I feel like I'm not exactly incapable of being a servant.

26
00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.340
Then I can pick you up in Beijing.

27
00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:59.960
Let you enjoy it.

28
00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.440
You are not filial.

29
00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:02.640
Children are not filial.

30
00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:03.480
They're useless children.

31
00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.340
They're useless children.

32
00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:07.840
Van Hieu

33
00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:09.660
How could you think that?

34
00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.280
I never expected you to succeed.

35
00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:13.940
Let me have a good life.

36
00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.940
Mom.

37
00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:18.460
You raised me from the flood waters.

38
00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.220
Growing up alone.

39
00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.600
And destroyed 20 years of my life to change my life.

40
00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.680
These kids see it in their eyes.

41
00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:26.980
Remember.

42
00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.760
The most important thing in my life is to repay your kindness.

43
00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.460
Let me have a good life.

44
00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:36.800
I'm not thinking well.

45
00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.480
I like peace.

46
00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:40.360
The village is far from the dispute.

47
00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.640
But forget that your mood is uncertain.

48
00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.080
Looking forward to contributing

49
00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:45.720
I'm your Li Huining's son.

50
00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:46.900
No need to self deprecate

51
00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.240
What you want

52
00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.620
Mom's all for you.

53
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:50.800
Mom.

54
00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:52.540
What do you mean?

55
00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:54.940
Promise to help me hide the truth?

56
00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:57.140
Tricked for a while.

57
00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:58.660
You can't fool a lifetime.

58
00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:01.040
Are you going to spend your whole life not thinking about your mother?

59
00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:02.540
I'm ready for you.

60
00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.300
It goes beyond everything your family has prepared for you.

61
00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.820
Mom, stop kidding.

62
00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:08.960
In this big city.

63
00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:12.040
We're like ants.

64
00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.020
How can it compare to my family?

65
00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:15.440
Van Hieu

66
00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.640
You look down on yourself too much.

67
00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.500
The situation in this world is unpredictable.

68
00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.400
Who needs to know about tomorrow?

69
00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.180
Please rest assured to wait for marriage.

70
00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.080
When I led the army to fight for my mother

71
00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.960
His surname is Su, but he is a big soldier under his mother's command.

72
00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:32.840
Not even my status as a mother.

73
00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:38.380
You know, you have no idea how noble your status is.

74
00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.700
Old lady fucking

75
00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.820
Why ruin my good work?

76
00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.140
You'd better go home to me.

77
00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:57.940
Otherwise, both parents die.

78
00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.700
It's not really a lie.
