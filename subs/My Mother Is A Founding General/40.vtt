1
00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:02.060
I'll never regret it.

2
00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:06.120
Go.

3
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:14.700
Send a message to General Ben.

4
00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:18.233
Don't assume that you are the leader of a civil servant.

5
00:00:18.233 --> 00:00:20.300
Maybe one hand covers the sky over the court.

6
00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.440
My husband was a general under the princess.

7
00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:26.199
It belongs to the old General Qin.

8
00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:27.220
Interested

9
00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.840
You alone are not his enemy.

10
00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:31.466
Good.

11
00:00:31.466 --> 00:00:36.000
General Qin and the former general have a common heart.

12
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.760
Princess Enze

13
00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.600
If he knew the Security King was harassed

14
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.440
I certainly won't forgive you.

15
00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.020
The army is a character.

16
00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.300
It's just that he doesn't know people.

17
00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.300
Climbed into a high position by an ant beetle.

18
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.660
It's sad.

19
00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.340
What did you say?

20
00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:56.740
Dare to talk freely

21
00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.760
General Qin will be here soon.

22
00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.420
All three of you are waiting for me to die.

23
00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:12.700
Good morning, Your Majesty.

24
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.620
Love Khanh Binh Than

25
00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.140
Your Majesty has heard that the government has changed.

26
00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.420
Dare to ask but it is related to the Security King.

27
00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.040
Message from Liu Xiang

28
00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.460
See for yourself.

29
00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.220
On the contrary.

30
00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.980
How could there be such disloyalty in this world?

31
00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:43.500
Inhuman injustice

32
00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.780
Excuse me, Your Majesty.

33
00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:47.780
Go to the top yourself.

34
00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.860
Bring these criminals to justice.

35
00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:52.540
Main direction

36
00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:55.420
No need.

37
00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:57.300
Do as you wish.

38
00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:59.900
It's just this occasion.

39
00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:01.700
How could it be lacking?

40
00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.420
Your Majesty's intention is to transmit my will.

41
00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.380
We've got a health problem with the princess.

42
00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:07.860
It is not convenient to go to the wedding.

43
00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:12.140
An Ninh King and the gods walked in the royal wedding

44
00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:17.300
I want to see how this play ends.

45
00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.420
The minister obeyed.
