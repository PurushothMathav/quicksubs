00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:14.340
He has been anonymous for years.

2
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.460
I just want to live the lives of ordinary people.

3
00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:19.860
I didn't expect you because you have no family background.

4
00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:22.260
It's hard to walk in court

5
00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:23.820
I'm not thinking well.

6
00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:25.580
In that case.

7
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.100
I'm going to take you directly to the clouds today.

8
00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:31.020
Step up to the clouds

9
00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.620
The good times have come.

10
00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:50.020
Van Hieu visited his parents-in-law

11
00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:51.380
Mom and Dad

12
00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:53.160
Congratulations.

13
00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.640
Master Li is so lucky.

14
00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.340
The family has a prominent position.

15
00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.200
Married to the only daughter of the family.

16
00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:03.240
The future of Prince Li can definitely fly straight to the achievement of a great career.

17
00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:05.140
Master Chu wrongly praised

18
00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:07.960
Yesterday, Her Royal Highness officially announced her return to the Kingdom.

19
00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.160
I will attend the family's wedding today.

20
00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.320
Congratulations to Mr. Lee and Ms. To.

21
00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.040
Even Your Majesty is terrified.

22
00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.620
Such glory is rare.

23
00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.480
Princess Phoenix is coming.

24
00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:21.560
Please wait here a moment.

25
00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.160
So as not to lose the ceremony.

26
00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:23.832
Please.

27
00:01:23.832 --> 00:01:27.233
Hahaha, that's right hahaha

28
00:01:27.233 --> 00:01:27.580
Please.

29
00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.240
Someone called him an hour.

30
00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:32.440
He really answered.

31
00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:34.720
A muddy foot from the remote countryside

32
00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:36.440
If you don't have to hug my house

33
00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:38.699
My whole life is a slave.

34
00:01:38.699 --> 00:01:39.260
Come on.

35
00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.420
Coming from almost

36
00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:43.720
You just have to be nice to the bird.

37
00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:44.520
Wow.

38
00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:46.840
If it wasn't for the sake of the bird.

39
00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.360
I will not accept this marriage.

40
00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.920
Well, father-in-law, mother-in-law.

41
00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:52.933
In a minute.

42
00:01:52.933 --> 00:01:55.280
Let the son-in-law go out to the chief princess first.

43
00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:56.420
You two.

44
00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:58.520
Let's get some rest with Jen Nhi first.

45
00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:59.700
So as not to get tired.

46
00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.520
How noble is the Lord Princess?

47
00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.400
You are an airliner that is worthy of flying the Phoenix.

48
00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.000
Stay here and be honest with me.

49
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.620
Take good care of the guests.

50
00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:10.540
If you lose my face.

51
00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.500
I want you to look good.

52
00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:17.740
Van Hieu

53
00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:21.940
You don't have to serve anyone.
