00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:02.120
False order

2
00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:05.180
I want to deal with you with a lot of tricks.

3
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.700
Would you use such an inferior method?

4
00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:10.380
You are too tall to look at yourselves.

5
00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:12.633
You have sent the Holy Spirit.

6
00:00:12.633 --> 00:00:15.560
Just to abort my throne.

7
00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:17.860
Let me bow my head and admit my mistake.

8
00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:21.480
But you despise the law of the court.

9
00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.460
You despise me too much.

10
00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:26.820
The Liu Xiang faked the sacred instruction

11
00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:29.300
My throne still counts.

12
00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:31.860
I'm still the princess's adopted son.

13
00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.420
Gentlemen.

14
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.980
Don't get on the wrong team.

15
00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:43.120
Bridegroom, that was a misunderstanding.

16
00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.420
Because she was also cheated by him to say rude to you.

17
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.040
Can you forgive me for once?

18
00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:52.360
Who just blamed me?

19
00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:57.580
Who said I was deposed by the emperor after nothing was useless?

20
00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:00.840
You say I am not fit to be your son-in-law.

21
00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.500
Even my husband doesn't deserve it.

22
00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.800
The woman didn't mean to.

23
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.320
She's just hot-headed, attacking her mind, so she says confused words.

24
00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.260
Don't worry.

25
00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.740
I hope so.

26
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.166
Hello friend.

27
00:01:16.166 --> 00:01:19.380
Previously, I waited for the eyes to not know the legs.

28
00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.740
It almost made me cold.

29
00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.060
In this way, as long as you forgive us.

30
00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:27.900
I will give you a thousand pieces of gold.

31
00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:30.180
The dowry for the little girl

32
00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.500
It's almost like that.

33
00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:36.340
Ly Hue Ninh

34
00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.180
You saw it.

35
00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.420
That's the power of power and class.

36
00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.440
As long as I have it all.

37
00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:45.040
I'll stand higher.

38
00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:46.680
I can have everything.

39
00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.440
And you're a rural woman.

40
00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:50.700
Fight me for what?

41
00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.460
Power.

42
00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.380
Haha.

43
00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.680
These things you've tried a lot to feed dogs.

44
00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:02.340
In my eyes like dirt

45
00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:03.860
It's not worth talking about.

46
00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.820
It's like shit that's not worth talking about.

47
00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:09.720
Your mouth is full of nonsense.

48
00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.060
You can lie to others, don't lie to yourself.

49
00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:16.340
You're just selling tofu at a street stall.

50
00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:17.800
What do you know about power?

51
00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.780
What the hell do you know?

52
00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.940
I was born the highest power.

53
00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.420
What's not to understand?

54
00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:28.800
The Lord wants to give you everything.

55
00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.360
You just want to be hot.

56
00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:33.240
In the basic heart

57
00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.420
There's no half point in me being a mother.

58
00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.980
But...

59
00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.980
There's a little love in your heart

60
00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.333
It won't fall into this field.

61
00:02:44.333 --> 00:02:44.980
Falling

62
00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:46.940
That's bullshit.

63
00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:49.820
I chose a good path.

64
00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:51.032
You can give me

65
00:02:51.032 --> 00:02:53.366
It's just your mouth talking over and over again.

66
00:02:53.366 --> 00:02:55.299
20 years of parenting.

67
00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:57.200
Lost 20 years of service life

68
00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:58.766
And what I can get

69
00:02:58.766 --> 00:03:01.100
That's glory and power.

70
00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.820
There are also endless mountains of gold and silver.

71
00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.020
Besides, I'm not asking you to do me those favors.

72
00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.780
I don't put those things in my eyes.

73
00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.660
Compared to the gift the princess gave me.

74
00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.500
It's not worth talking about.

75
00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.060
I hope you didn't make a choice today.

76
00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:21.220
And regret
