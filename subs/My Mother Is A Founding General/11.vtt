00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:01.500
You're crazy.

2
00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.380
As I always say

3
00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:17.900
People who do not love their relatives

4
00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:19.920
Not with grass and wood.

5
00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.660
Don't be impious

6
00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.700
Waste of human skin

7
00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.300
I can't believe you're so cruel.

8
00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.540
Li Wenxiao, is your heart made of stone?

9
00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.860
Just for today.

10
00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.600
Even though I'm cold to you

11
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.700
But in the end I owe you.

12
00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:46.940
You can only kneel for me.

13
00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.980
The ceremony of three kneeling nine knocks

14
00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:52.820
I will forgive you this time.

15
00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:54.240
What the hell are you?

16
00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:55.900
It's worth my husband kneeling for you.

17
00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.900
Why am I his mother?

18
00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:05.500
With a piece of shit, a piece of my urine pulls him up.

19
00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.380
Because I'm hungry for him to learn.

20
00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.220
Because I lost 20 years of my life.

21
00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.420
In exchange for his life.

22
00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.460
Li Wenxiao, didn't you tell me you were an orphan?

23
00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:18.466
Column

24
00:01:18.466 --> 00:01:20.180
You explain it clearly to me. 

25
00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.180
What the hell is this?

26
00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.180
Little animal, you've been lying to us all this time.

27
00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:26.660
She's my mother.

28
00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.500
My mother raised me for 20 years.

29
00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.900
But I didn't ask you to raise me.

30
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.180
You're already poor like this.

31
00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.000
And you picked me up.

32
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.060
Do you know how your poverty ruined my life?

33
00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.040
Van Hieu

34
00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.120
I don't care about my own safety.

35
00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:49.160
To save you from the flood.

36
00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:51.000
Raising you as an adult

37
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.120
I have no hesitation in losing 20 years of my life.

38
00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:56.060
Give you a chance to live.

39
00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.700
You paid him a lot.

40
00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.820
Aren't you afraid he won't appreciate it later?

41
00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:08.020
No, I believe that Van Hieu is a filial child.

42
00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:12.960
But now you're doing it to me.

43
00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:16.660
My heart hurts.

44
00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.140
Am I begging you to save me?

45
00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.860
You want me to live in this world.

46
00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.160
If the other person's parents are not prime ministers

47
00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.780
If not the general.

48
00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.040
People's children are born to be able to enjoy the rich glory.

49
00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.160
But what about me? What can you give me?

50
00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.000
Just a rude country girl.

51
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.060
Only know that in a small place in Lac Phuong village selling tofu curd.

52
00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.100
What do I compare with others?
