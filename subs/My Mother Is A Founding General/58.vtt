00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:02.220
Haha.

2
00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:04.060
Okay.

3
00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.000
Very well, the bow wants to cut off the way of life.

4
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.500
Are you against it?

5
00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:12.920
May the Princess have mercy.

6
00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:15.160
You bit a rural woman.

7
00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:18.380
When you let the bow cut its way, one is more decisive than the other.

8
00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.240
Now the Lord's house is for you to cut off your way of life.

9
00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.340
You've all become soft-bone mice.

10
00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:25.700
You call yourselves gods of the skull.

11
00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.100
The birth itself would shake the foundations of the court.

12
00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:30.940
In front of me.

13
00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:32.320
It's all like an ant.

14
00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.580
Are you against it?

15
00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.220
You all say a rural woman.

16
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.220
You may respect the chief princess too.

17
00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:43.740
But have you ever thought

18
00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.240
Immorality in your mouth.

19
00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:50.380
The cowardly country woman, now holds your life and your death

20
00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.060
What did General Su say?

21
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.860
You and I have the difference between clouds and mud.

22
00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:58.600
Don't want to lower the price yourself.

23
00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.060
Compare with us

24
00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.140
They say I don't discriminate.

25
00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:03.620
Disturbing the whole school.

26
00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.840
Who is it after all?

27
00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:07.960
After all, who doesn't make a difference?

28
00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.080
Who's disturbing the whole school?

29
00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.260
There will be guilt.

30
00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.340
Please punish the princess.

31
00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:18.860
My family lied to the palace that year under the general

32
00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.380
Under the flag of the palace, outside splendidly.

33
00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:24.020
Accept the emperor's grace

34
00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.180
Save this master.

35
00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.440
What crime?

36
00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:29.633
Back to the Princess.

37
00:01:29.633 --> 00:01:31.800
The river has committed many crimes.

38
00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.733
He committed many major crimes.

39
00:01:33.733 --> 00:01:35.380
According to the law, nine tribes are judged.
