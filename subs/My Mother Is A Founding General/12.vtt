00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:01.960
We exchange lives for lives.

2
00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:03.220
In exchange for your peace

3
00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:04.860
Let you read

4
00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:06.540
Send you to the company

5
00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:11.440
But in return you are so ungrateful.

6
00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:13.400
Since you adopted me.

7
00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.680
That's not all you should do.

8
00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:17.380
What you said is very good.

9
00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:19.480
Adopt me, send me to school.

10
00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.500
Is it not because you want me to be your captain?

11
00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:24.000
Remember your kindness.

12
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.380
Then let you enjoy the wealth?

13
00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:28.740
Van Hieu

14
00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:34.080
Aren't you grateful for what you've done?

15
00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:37.140
Are you a heart of stone?

16
00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:42.860
Is affection useful in this world? Is it possible to solve the problem of food and clothing?

17
00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.680
If you're really good to me

18
00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:49.020
You should not let me know the injustice and disparity in this world.

19
00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.340
How do you want me to thank you?

20
00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.400
Have you spent your whole life in pain?

21
00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:56.760
You broke into the house.

22
00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:57.800
Forgive me.

23
00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.560
No, just to shame me in front of everyone.

24
00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.900
Isn t it because you won t let me be your husband?

25
00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:08.500
You want money, right?

26
00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.280
Say it if you want money.

27
00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.020
I can give it to you.

28
00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:13.740
Is 100 taels enough?

29
00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.140
Is 500 taels enough?

30
00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:21.140
1,000 taels is enough.

31
00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.900
1,000 taels probably never seen in my whole life.

32
00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:32.140
You can use these checks to buy a fake death wish.

33
00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:35.540
1,000 lang

34
00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:38.900
1,000 lang

35
00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.640
That's a lot of money.

36
00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.300
Haha ha, the cheap woman in the countryside did not have much knowledge.

37
00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.100
Even a thousand dollars will make you lose your temper.

38
00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:57.000
Van Hieu, are you insulting me with money or are you using money to humiliate yourself?

39
00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.660
What do you think I did for you?

40
00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.500
Is it all because of these external things?

41
00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.720
Your precious money.

42
00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:07.580
In my eyes like dirt

43
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.700
Your noble official.

44
00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.780
In my eyes is a colony of ants.

45
00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:22.940
Little Girl

46
00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.580
Dare to be rude in front of the general.

47
00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.900
You dare to insult the things that do not know life and death of our Su.

48
00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.840
What is Li Van Hieu doing standing there?

49
00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.200
Quickly clarify your relationship with this smelly woman.

50
00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.720
Get her out of here now.

51
00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:35.860
If not

52
00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.320
Want to come to my door.

53
00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:38.120
Don't think.

54
00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.320
I don't use Ly Huynh.

55
00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.340
To do this step today.

56
00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.660
I'm going to cut my hair with you today.
