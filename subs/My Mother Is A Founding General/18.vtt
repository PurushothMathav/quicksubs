1
00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:01.460
Not on my knees.

2
00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:13.760
Your Majesty is meeting with foreign ambassadors.

3
00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:14.720
It'll be here in a minute.

4
00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:17.260
Special villains come to protect your safety.

5
00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:21.200
Who are you?

6
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:22.580
Why protect her?

7
00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:27.580
This is my oldest son, Ly Van Hieu.

8
00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:31.980
Ask me.

9
00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:33.499
You son of a bitch.

10
00:00:33.499 --> 00:00:34.460
She is

11
00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:39.940
This has nothing to do with you.

12
00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:43.340
All you have to do now is apologize immediately.

13
00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.900
Find a way to live for you.

14
00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.560
What do you mean?

15
00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:51.480
If I'm not sorry

16
00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.980
I will die without a place to be buried.

17
00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.820
That's right haha

18
00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:58.466
That's great.

19
00:00:58.466 --> 00:01:04.540
Not to say that I was blessed to become the son of the princess.

20
00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:08.700
Your Majesty himself gave King Security a step to heaven.

21
00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.420
Said she tore up the edict in public.

22
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.300
Humiliate the court.

23
00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:14.920
Humiliate the Princess

24
00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:16.220
Disgrace the saint

25
00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.860
Nine deaths are to blame.

26
00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.699
Unless

27
00:01:19.699 --> 00:01:23.460
You have something arrogant about God.

28
00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.900
If not, why are you guilty of this crime?

29
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.180
Why destroy me, this king of peace?

30
00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:33.860
Is it just based on her mouth?

31
00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.620
You don't know how to live and die.

32
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.020
You dare hit me.

33
00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:49.400
What hit you?

34
00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.780
But there was one thing you said that wasn't wrong.

35
00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.380
Destroy you and your family behind you.

36
00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.940
It's about talking.

37
00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.220
You, you, calm down.

38
00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.200
Neither of us can beat this man, I am the King of Security.

39
00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.280
What's not to be ridiculed?

40
00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.580
Oh, my God.

41
00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.160
This man is Your Majesty's blessing.

42
00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.900
The front guard brought the leader of 10,000 banished ha ha

43
00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.820
What about Your Majesty's family?

44
00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:20.340
This vile woman dared to tear up Your Majesty's holy order in public.

45
00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.060
And insulting the royal court and the chief princess.

46
00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:29.060
The Holy Father will absolutely not tolerate her disrespectful behavior.

47
00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:30.460
One piece one cheap

48
00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:31.880
Have you forgotten?

49
00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:35.380
Who is the one hand pulling you to big?

50
00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.220
Who gave you a second life?

51
00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:43.420
Who helped you achieve the success you are today?

52
00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:44.960
Current achievements

53
00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:46.180
Current status

54
00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:49.540
It's all about her quietly helping you behind your back.

55
00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.540
That's how you treat her now.

56
00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.020
Have you thought about your future consequences?
