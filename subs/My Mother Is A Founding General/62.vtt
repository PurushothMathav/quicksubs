00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.800
If you hadn't saved me from the flood

2
00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:04.120
I was dead a long time ago.

3
00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:04.966
If not you

4
00:00:04.966 --> 00:00:08.020
Since reducing my life expectancy by 20 years to continue my life

5
00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.720
Give me life over and over again

6
00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:13.166
How could I be here today?

7
00:00:13.166 --> 00:00:13.420
Mom.

8
00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:16.820
We have had a mother for over 20 years.

9
00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:20.100
Even though I've severed ties with you.

10
00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:22.080
But it's just a temporary measure.

11
00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.900
I wanted to be my first husband.

12
00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:26.580
Then stand firm.

13
00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.180
Please come back here to enjoy yourself, Mom.

14
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.140
It's too late.

15
00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.740
What do you say now?

16
00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:36.260
I won't believe it.

17
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.380
Mom, if you really have a heart, don't have children.

18
00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:46.500
Do you remember?

19
00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.140
I didn't understand anything when I was a kid.

20
00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:50.740
I almost got lost.

21
00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.500
You don't mind looking for me all night.

22
00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:56.960
You said you like to eat the waffle cake of the village next door.

23
00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.360
I ran ten miles to buy it back for you.

24
00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.660
That year you opened a tofu brain stall.

25
00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:03.960
I'll read and write right next to you.

26
00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.060
We live together in Lac Phuong village.

27
00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:09.720
Have you forgotten?  

28
00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:10.520
Mom.

29
00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.060
That's the past.

30
00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.460
Now you're blindfolded by power.

31
00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.180
Forgetting the original intention

32
00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:22.900
Day in Lac Phuong Village

33
00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:25.700
It really reminds me.

34
00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:27.980
It's that simple.

35
00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:30.980
Not anymore.

36
00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.020
What you did.

37
00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.380
It makes me completely cold.

38
00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.180
Let our mother's love divide.

39
00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.100
To the end

40
00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:45.880
Lady, I really know I'm wrong.

41
00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:47.360
You forgive me this time.

42
00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:48.660
I I

43
00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.700
I'll never do that shit again.

44
00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:54.100
Could you please give me another chance?

45
00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:58.100
Van Hieu

46
00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:00.380
Life is like a flag.

47
00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:01.980
One wrong step

48
00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.460
The whole defeat.

49
00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.620
Hope you remember.

50
00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:10.999
Next time.

51
00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.700
Mom.

52
00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.280
I will definitely listen to your mother next time.

53
00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:15.100
No.

54
00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:17.780
next life

55
00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:20.580
I hope you are a good son.

56
00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:23.280
Mom.

57
00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:24.600
Mom.

58
00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:27.580
The Queen

59
00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:28.760
Mom.

60
00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:30.280
Mom.

61
00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:32.400
You can't take me.

62
00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.080
I'm the adopted daughter of the princess.

63
00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.520
The future will be a prince.

64
00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.040
He would later become emperor.

65
00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:38.160
Who dares to kill me?

66
00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.020
Who dares to kill me?
