00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.420
Why didn't you let me go to the city?

2
00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:04.120
He must be worried about my weakness.

3
00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:05.580
Afraid I'll get in trouble on the way

4
00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:07.580
Something as big as marriage.

5
00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:09.540
If I wasn't here

6
00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:11.940
Do my relatives think I don't know about it?

7
00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:14.160
No, I have to go to the capital to find him.

8
00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.940
What does Hoang write on her letter?

9
00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.040
You're welcome.

10
00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:21.360
He wants me to go to the city.

11
00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:22.520
I told you.

12
00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:23.880
Okay, I won't tell you anymore.

13
00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.420
I've got to go home and pack.

14
00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.580
Hoang. Hoang.

15
00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.060
Your Majesty.

16
00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:34.240
Van Hieu is of course a filial child.

17
00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:37.280
I would like to give a wedding gift to her.

18
00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:39.966
I want to reward the family.

19
00:00:39.966 --> 00:00:40.780
Your Majesty.

20
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.300
Your Majesty paid attention to the dragon's body.

21
00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:51.660
I'm okay, I can't even die.

22
00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:53.140
The country of summer.

23
00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:56.940
It hasn't been delivered to Hoang yet.

24
00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:04.500
This letter should be able to dispel my mother's worries.

25
00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.060
I hope you can understand the child's situation.

26
00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:10.000
Stay in the countryside.

27
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.100
Don't come to the capital to trouble me.

28
00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.540
Van Hieu

29
00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:20.760
Vu Hieu, this is our invitation to get married.

30
00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.240
Inside are all the family members.

31
00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:24.880
Do you have any family members with weight?

32
00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:25.980
You fill it in.

33
00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:30.520
Jen Nhi, you know.

34
00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:31.480
My parents died.

35
00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:32.400
Alone.

36
00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.680
What if I don't have to see you?

37
00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.020
I don't know where to go.

38
00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:37.080
It's for the best.

39
00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:38.400
I want to marry you.

40
00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.080
In addition to appreciating your talent

41
00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:41.720
It's just seeing you have no father, no mother.

42
00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:43.860
There are no poor relatives no three no four.

43
00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.280
Don't lie to me.

44
00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:46.740
If you lie to me

45
00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.660
My father will tear you to pieces.

46
00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.240
I swear if I had half a lie

47
00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.340
I pray that God's lightning strike will not die well.

48
00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:56.020
It's the same.

49
00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.980
Someone outside the palace asked to see Prince Li.

50
00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.260
Do you have any guests?

51
00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:06.380
No, it could be an old classmate of mine.

52
00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:07.520
I'll take a look.

53
00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:08.500
Be right back.

54
00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.420
Mom, don't come.

55
00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:21.840
I want to marry you.

56
00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.520
In addition to appreciating your talent

57
00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.000
It's just that you don't have those three.

58
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.280
Not four poor relatives, if you lie to me

59
00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.740
My father will definitely teach you how to cut up a dead body.
