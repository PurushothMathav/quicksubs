00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:04.300
Funny, this crazy old lady dared to let Su apologize.

2
00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:08.740
Did you know that General Su was a general under the head princess?

3
00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:10.240
Very much loved by Your Majesty.

4
00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:11.940
Dare to touch the tiger's beard

5
00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:13.680
I really don't know how to live and die.

6
00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:18.300
Li Wenxiao, this crazy woman, let us apologize to you.

7
00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:19.620
What do you think?

8
00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.500
Does Ben need to apologize to you?

9
00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.400
"No, no," my mother-in-law joked.

10
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.160
It's all the son-in-law's fault.

11
00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:29.820
I blame my son for not stopping in time.

12
00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:32.940
Hey, let this bitch get in our way, cover the door.

13
00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:35.780
Your son-in-law should apologize to you.

14
00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:38.960
Go.

15
00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:40.820
Didn't you hurt me enough?

16
00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:42.960
Today is the most important moment in my life.

17
00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.280
You're going to keep kidding.

18
00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.940
Do you want to see that I have nothing?

19
00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:47.760
Van Hieu

20
00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:49.700
What did you say?

21
00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:51.620
That's how they treat you.

22
00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:52.800
I'll speak for you.

23
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:53.880
You let me go.

24
00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:55.760
Enough, stop talking.

25
00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.280
Go away, Lee Van Hieu, what are you doing?

26
00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.800
The wedding is about to begin.

27
00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.200
The princess will be here any moment.

28
00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.700
Are you going to let this crazy woman ruin our wedding?

29
00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.000
Li Wenxiao, if you don't kick her out.

30
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.100
The wedding is no longer necessary.

31
00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:13.100
My father-in-law is angry.

32
00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.280
I'm going to kick her out right now.

33
00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.620
What a ride on the ground.

34
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.140
The style of work is so strong.

35
00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:22.200
This one.

36
00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:24.620
You can't.

37
00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.780
Van Hieu, wake up.

38
00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.300
When I give it to you, I will double it for you.

39
00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.299
I want you gone. 

40
00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:33.980
Go away.
