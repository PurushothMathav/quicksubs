1
00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:01.980
But you...

2
00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:05.140
But for a family.

3
00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:07.460
For a small profit.

4
00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:09.620
Left me like we were

5
00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:12.460
Now you should understand.

6
00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.220
Your betrayal.

7
00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.380
What will it cost?

8
00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:21.940
So...

9
00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:29.500
You've been hiding from me for 20 years.

10
00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:33.040
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

11
00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:33.699
You told me.

12
00:00:33.699 --> 00:00:36.380
It's obviously not going to develop to this point.

13
00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:37.820
I told you.

14
00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:40.140
Do you believe it?

15
00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:41.980
At first

16
00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:44.820
I'm tired of court chaos.

17
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.780
Choose to live in hiding.

18
00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.780
I saved you from the flood.

19
00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:51.920
The summer border is full of smoke

20
00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:53.140
Foreign countries without countries

21
00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.420
I shouldn't have stayed.

22
00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:57.860
But I can't let you go.

23
00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.740
I've been here for 20 years.

24
00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.140
20 years of company.

25
00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:03.420
For you.

26
00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:05.433
Nonsense. 

27
00:01:05.433 --> 00:01:05.700
Mom.

28
00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:09.320
I really know wrong, Mom.

29
00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.260
Dear, it's too late.

30
00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.540
The wealth, power, status you want.

31
00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.140
In my eyes

32
00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:17.660
It's worthless.

33
00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:19.620
You want more power.

34
00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:20.940
The higher class.

35
00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:22.700
There's nothing wrong with that.

36
00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:24.460
I'm also happy for you.

37
00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:28.680
But you shouldn't be ungrateful.

38
00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.266
Cut off your mother's relationship with me.

39
00:01:31.266 --> 00:01:31.620
Mom.

40
00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:33.640
I'm just lost.

41
00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:35.860
None of this is what my mother wanted.

42
00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.380
It seems

43
00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.000
There's really a difference between you and me between clouds and mud.

44
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.520
From now on

45
00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.020
You and me

46
00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:45.860
You, Li Van Hieu.

47
00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:48.940
He's not my adopted son anymore.

48
00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.900
You do it yourself.

49
00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.580
Someone pulled it down.

50
00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:58.300
Foreign Mausoleum of Death
