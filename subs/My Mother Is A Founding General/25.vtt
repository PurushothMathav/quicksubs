00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:04.140
You're so brave.

2
00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:10.760
Welcome, Prime Minister.

3
00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:12.920
Welcome, Prime Minister.

4
00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:13.960
Prime Minister.

5
00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:15.680
What brings you here?

6
00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:18.200
The Prime Minister is here to attend your wedding with Van Hieu.

7
00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.460
It is glorious to overlay us today.

8
00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.960
At first I just wanted to torture you slowly.

9
00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.400
But now the adults have arrived.

10
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.540
Looks like your ending was bad.

11
00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.340
Let's wait and see.

12
00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.100
Young Ly Van Hieu welcomed the Prime Minister

13
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.800
What happened to that arrow?

14
00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.540
I told him to shoot.

15
00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:45.700
You have an opinion.

16
00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:55.700
In front of the Prime Minister, you can do anything.

17
00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:57.800
Are you taking your life too long?

18
00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.080
I really don't know how to live and die.

19
00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:01.420
Be arrogant in front of the Prime Minister.

20
00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.320
Even if thousands of leaders support you.

21
00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:04.540
You have no way either.

22
00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.120
Why are you still sitting there?

23
00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:07.640
Get out of here!

24
00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.700
Get down in front of the Prime Minister.

25
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:10.800
Prime Minister.

26
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.120
This person is a rural woman.

27
00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:14.360
I don't know, it's not possible every day.

28
00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:15.360
It's lawless.

29
00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.220
Should serve large

30
00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.460
What are you talking about?

31
00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:21.780
The Prime Minister is angry.

32
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.100
I'll take care of this smelly old lady.

33
00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.480
If I'm not mistaken.

34
00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:31.540
Does she have to be your mother?

35
00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:34.760
Prime Minister.

36
00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:36.920
Even though she used to be my foster mother.

37
00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.460
But what she did today has nothing to do with me.

38
00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:44.199
Very well, Prime Minister, you can testify.

39
00:01:44.199 --> 00:01:47.400
Van Hieu and rural women have abandoned their duties.

40
00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:48.866
It's got nothing to do with it.

41
00:01:48.866 --> 00:01:49.100
Right.

42
00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:54.420
You mean he didn't have a crush on her?

43
00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.360
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

44
00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:58.820
Van Hieu is now only the son-in-law of our house.

45
00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.000
She is also the adopted daughter of the princess.

46
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.700
It has nothing to do with him.

47
00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.100
Princess Yoshiko

48
00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:06.480
Huh?

49
00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.240
What a great princess.

50
00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.380
What a mean Yamano woman.

51
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.260
That's very brave.
