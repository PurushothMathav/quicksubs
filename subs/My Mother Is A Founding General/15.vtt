1
00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:00.799
Decree

2
00:00:00.799 --> 00:00:02.166
Crazy.

3
00:00:02.166 --> 00:00:04.060
Dare to tear away the sacred

4
00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:07.500
You're crazy, I want you dead.

5
00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.000
Prince, are you okay?

6
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.140
Ly Hue Ninh tore up the holy precept

7
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.420
When people dishonor God, you have a way to die.

8
00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:22.280
Wei, you have to be my master.

9
00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:23.600
Who are you?

10
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.040
He just doesn't kneel.

11
00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:27.520
Now they are openly tearing down the holy precept.

12
00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:29.133
You know the crime.

13
00:00:29.133 --> 00:00:30.340
Who am I?

14
00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.780
I am disloyal to this.

15
00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.500
The ungrateful animal abandoned her mother

16
00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.780
It's also a reward for him.

17
00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.420
Help him take a step into the sky.

18
00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:43.820
The Gift Giver

19
00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:45.400
This is hers.

20
00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.640
No way, Lee Hye Ning.

21
00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.420
You tore up the order in public.

22
00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.540
Claiming to be the giver.

23
00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:53.360
You're crazy.

24
00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.900
This is Your Majesty's will.

25
00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:59.100
The reward is your grace.

26
00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.700
You said you were the giver.

27
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.680
Are you the big summer?

28
00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.540
Today, the Suyama River.

29
00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.080
The servant of the family is so brave.

30
00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.460
I read birth and death under your holiness.

31
00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.480
Because of your best efforts, please send your family a royal decree to support the scene.

32
00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:21.540
This is how you repay our family.

33
00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.040
The pseudo-public superintendent.

34
00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.260
My family has been average for generations.

35
00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.480
It has nothing to do with this man.

36
00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.566
No wonder you want to cut off your mother s relationship with you.

37
00:01:32.566 --> 00:01:34.200
You have died without repentance.

38
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.740
In front of everyone, you can tear up the holy book.

39
00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.060
You, are you guilty of anything?

40
00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:40.680
The crazy woman doesn't know how to die.

41
00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.880
I didn't even get down on my knees and apologize to Duke Wei.

42
00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.420
What am I guilty of?

43
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.220
About the crime

44
00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:48.840
They must be traitors.

45
00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.860
The ungrateful man knelt down on my head.

46
00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:52.366
Bold apples

47
00:01:52.366 --> 00:01:55.660
Did you know he's the princess's adopted son?

48
00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:57.940
Your Majesty, the King of Peace.

49
00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:59.240
You son of a bitch.

50
00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.120
Disrespect of imperial power

51
00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:02.620
The Right to Humiliate the Prince

52
00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.780
You have heads to mourn.

53
00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:12.420
What you call the chief god princess is just an ordinary one.

54
00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:18.020
You can't see the real face of this ungrateful animal.

55
00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.940
Insulting the princess is an unforgivable crime.

56
00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.280
Li Huining, you must pay for your arrogance today.

57
00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.360
My wife is getting married today.

58
00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.120
The officials gathered.

59
00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:30.820
Removing the order in public

60
00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:32.320
Humiliate the Princess

61
00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:33.580
His crimes deserve to be punished.

62
00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.840
The bridegroom tells you to get down on your knees and apologize.

63
00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.760
I just don't want to make this too big.

64
00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.260
Give you a way of life.

65
00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.260
But you don't know anything.

66
00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:43.860
I don't need it.

67
00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.040
He gave me a way of life.

68
00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.660
For the edict tore in your mouth

69
00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.280
Humiliate the Princess

70
00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.300
You can talk to the people.

71
00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.340
Let's see if he can punish me.
