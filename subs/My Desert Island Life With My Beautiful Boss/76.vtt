00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:15.560
I'm sorry, Abo, why don't you let me go?

2
00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:18.070
We were not slightly burned to death, but our legs were already numb.

3
00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:20.310
Principles speak.

4
00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:24.040
Of course I can speak, but I didn’t ask for money when we first met.

5
00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:25.500
That’s why I avoided saying anything.

6
00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:30.150
How can you stay safe if you don't speak? So what's the logic?

7
00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:35.280
In fact, Wang Taoshang was not unreasonable in the past.

8
00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:38.240
At that time we had no language and no licenses or cars.

9
00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:43.010
We all worked and lived together, but then a stranger came to visit.

10
00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:47.670
It was she who understood our language, and also brought some weapons with us,

11
00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.270
As the situation progressed, Wang Taoshang was no longer at peace.

12
00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:54.870
Studying abroad and making up for the war in the end

13
00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:57.780
We were divided into two groups, Sirius and Saint Pang.

14
00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:00.760
It turns out that those and if they are secretaries

15
00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:02.430
That's the guy who came here

16
00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:05.120
Later, no one outside died

17
00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:06.880
In order to prevent weapons from looking at people again

18
00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:08.520
and shouted at them all

19
00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:10.670
But at that time I was still a junior commander

20
00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:12.810
I lost my head and hid a bag of secretaries to keep.

21
00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:16.730
Then why did you give me your secretary again?

22
00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:19.340
Because I think you are a good person

23
00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:20.220
With those secretaries

24
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:23.560
You can survive on the brain. I'm fine. I'm fine.
