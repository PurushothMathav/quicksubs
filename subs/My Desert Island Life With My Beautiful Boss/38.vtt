00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:02.700
But now we have to give birth to you

2
00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:03.480
Fill our bellies

3
00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:16.040
Master, you are not the one who killed this little pheasant, are you?

4
00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:19.370
That's right. He's so mature. I still keep him as a reserve.

5
00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.440
Dad, the thief is miserable. I am not miserable. Everyone is sick.

6
00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:29.470
This is indeed a bit too accurate

7
00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:32.229
Well, I donâ€™t eat or drink either

8
00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:33.990
But we have to eat enough

9
00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:45.510
No, it's troublesome

10
00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:51.600
I'll go and open a fish for you
