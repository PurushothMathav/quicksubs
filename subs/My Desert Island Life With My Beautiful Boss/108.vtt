00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.480
The other party, you have to take responsibility alone

2
00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:05.200
More kind and courageous

3
00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:08.780
Now I decide to pass you the location of the knife

4
00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:12.070
Let you choose with you.

5
00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:13.760
The only thing missing is two. I am very young

6
00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:20.150
Don't care about yourself.

7
00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:22.530
It's okay if you don't want to be a knifeman.

8
00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.980
But you have to choose a swordsman.

9
00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:37.920
Jie Fang, please go to me.

10
00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:42.860
This. Don't do anything wrong.

11
00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:44.760
We, the guides, are all present together.

12
00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:47.070
You can choose one.

13
00:00:47.070 --> 00:01:04.170
Better than choosing four.

14
00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.489
You must choose your result.
