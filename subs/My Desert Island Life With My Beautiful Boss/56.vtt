00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:10.510
Good, right? Economical.

2
00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:13.430
Why do you have so much meat and so little in your game?

3
00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:16.900
It's pretty good that a tuzi has no popularity.

4
00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.740
No, I think this contains a lot of meat for Ye Feng.

5
00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:24.580
And he also left a way with himself.

6
00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:27.300
Are these two the main workforce of this team?

7
00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:28.340
It doesn't matter if there are more or less.

8
00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.420
In fact, I have already noticed that the last thing they care about is you.

9
00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:39.780
What does main mean?

10
00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:43.350
If we stay on a desert island for the rest of our lives,

11
00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:47.810
You are willing to be breathed by them for the rest of your life.
