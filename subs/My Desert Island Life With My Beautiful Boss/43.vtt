00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:03.340
Zihan, how do you know you want a broken master?

2
00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:05.950
I found it when I stepped on it

3
00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:10.010
Zihan, why didn’t you tell me earlier?

4
00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:11.430
It’s fun. Let’s get excited early.

5
00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:13.460
I don't know if the main thing is unsafe

6
00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:15.160
So I took a look first.

7
00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:17.200
I won’t tell you until it’s safe today

8
00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.750
So is this main object left behind by the previous Tuzhuan?

9
00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:24.280
It was probably the residents of Tui who first remembered that the main object was broken.

10
00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:25.650
Should we tidy it up and use it?

11
00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:30.460
I won't clean it up

12
00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:31.820
You guys, I can't

13
00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:36.540
Miss nonsense, you have to tell him again

14
00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.000
You said I'm the eldest lady

15
00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:39.400
I definitely won't

16
00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:41.250
Want to survive in the team again

17
00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:42.650
everyone has to deal with

18
00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:46.610
Didn't I work hard before?

19
00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:49.200
This is how he behaved after doing it

20
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:49.820
You don't know

21
00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:52.280
Just don't start like him.

22
00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:02.310
There is a rule of survival

23
00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:03.590
Those who are not old must not be fit
