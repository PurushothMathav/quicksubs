00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:03.380
Mmm, what a delicious fish,

2
00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:05.890
There is no seasoning on the island. How did you cook it?

3
00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:08.450
It's very simple, get some sea water,

4
00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.840
Use a clothes pot to boil, then add a fluidized lid.

5
00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:15.040
Finally, it is boiled and stir-fried to get the edible salt.

6
00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:18.520
These nights are all from the trees on the island,

7
00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:19.480
All are natural flavors.

8
00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:22.670
I'm so awesome at returning it to you. I admire you more and more.

9
00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:24.490
Xia Ziha, you are so amazing,

10
00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:29.310
There is always a way. I have already eaten the unfinished fish meat and turned it into dried fish.

11
00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:30.810
Then hang on Natsuko.

12
00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:32.830
From now on we will have plants everywhere.

13
00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:35.460
I must express this to you

14
00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.590
If only some people were like you

15
00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.950
We're not interested

16
00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:55.120
Think about it yourself and do it

17
00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:56.530
what did you do
