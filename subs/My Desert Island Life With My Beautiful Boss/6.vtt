00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.150
Just let you keep the clip and refuse to listen,

2
00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.000
Now you know how to get through it.

3
00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.780
I don't care, this big sea sigh,

4
00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.550
I don't want to go and I'll starve to death.

5
00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:37.660
Hey, you are the only one who can run without breaking into something,

6
00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:39.600
The sun shines brightly in the sand,

7
00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.230
In the end, he was still shouting, come and catch me!

8
00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.400
Don't find fault with me, you are a man,

9
00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.380
You think of a way, I'll find my stuff,

10
00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:49.280
Thousand cat bellies.
