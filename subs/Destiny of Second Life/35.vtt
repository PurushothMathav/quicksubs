00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.466
I beg you.

2
00:00:02.066 --> 00:00:03.200
I beg you.

3
00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:04.900
I beg you.

4
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.366
I beg you.

5
00:00:20.566 --> 00:00:21.566
Please!

6
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.000
Mom throws the bucket, don't kneel

7
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.833
Aren't you going to marry Zhou Tong?

8
00:00:33.866 --> 00:00:36.666
We are going back to our hometown to inform our relatives and friends.

9
00:00:36.766 --> 00:00:38.466
Don't bother me anymore

10
00:00:38.933 --> 00:00:40.400
You can hear it from outside.

11
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.800
Liu Tao

12
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.333
It's also because I'm sick.

13
00:00:48.333 --> 00:00:50.966
That's why he's fighting with me. He wants to see my people

14
00:00:59.533 --> 00:01:01.633
But I don't want to implicate you.

15
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.866
I don't want you to suffer for me either

16
00:01:06.966 --> 00:01:08.966
So let's go back now, shall we?

17
00:01:08.966 --> 00:01:10.700
We don't ask them.

18
00:01:12.733 --> 00:01:13.533
Tingting

19
00:01:14.166 --> 00:01:15.100
This is what you gave birth to.

20
00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:15.766
Hope

21
00:01:15.766 --> 00:01:18.400
As long as the girl I love lives

22
00:01:18.466 --> 00:01:20.700
It's nothing if I'm wronged

23
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.700
I'm begging you.

24
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.033
Please ask me this question

25
00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.266
As long as I can live today

26
00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.233
I would like to be a cow and a horse

27
00:01:49.966 --> 00:01:51.200
That's too positive

28
00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.700
Are you still using the bitter meat meter?

29
00:01:52.866 --> 00:01:54.166
I'll tell you what.

30
00:01:54.166 --> 00:01:55.800
I won't do it for that girl

31
00:01:56.066 --> 00:01:57.966
To sacrifice my own health

32
00:01:58.133 --> 00:01:59.400
Do you understand?

33
00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.100
What does a dog do?

34
00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.166
Must have been trained in advance

35
00:02:14.266 --> 00:02:15.466
Also use bitter meat

36
00:02:16.566 --> 00:02:18.366
Brother, don't be soft-hearted.

37
00:02:18.366 --> 00:02:20.066
Enough swallows

38
00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:21.833
Tingting is also our niece

39
00:02:22.333 --> 00:02:23.833
We're worse than dogs.

40
00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:26.766
Child get up

41
00:02:27.266 --> 00:02:29.700
I will attend your wedding then

42
00:02:29.733 --> 00:02:31.666
But that marrow has always been a thing

43
00:02:31.933 --> 00:02:34.466
You let us think about it again

44
00:02:34.466 --> 00:02:36.733
Thank you. Thank you.

45
00:02:36.733 --> 00:02:38.700
Thank you. Thank you.

46
00:02:50.066 --> 00:02:52.200
Please come in please come in ok
