00:00:04.133 --> 00:00:06.666
Bride, it's your turn to play

2
00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:12.433
Miss you, you came back to participate

3
00:00:12.933 --> 00:00:15.233
Right, ladies and gentlemen?

4
00:00:15.333 --> 00:00:18.833
Now we have the beautiful bride Zhao Ting

5
00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:28.633
Dad?

6
00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.800
Are you looking at me?

7
00:01:32.266 --> 00:01:34.366
I'm not afraid to die.

8
00:01:34.666 --> 00:01:37.600
Because I'm going to see you soon.

9
00:01:38.466 --> 00:01:39.266
Tingting

10
00:01:40.066 --> 00:01:41.566
Mom is proud of you

11
00:01:42.166 --> 00:01:44.166
You are the strongest daughter

12
00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:47.366
I believe you will be happy.

13
00:01:47.666 --> 00:01:50.466
Tingting, no matter what difficulties you encounter

14
00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.433
We will always support you.

15
00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.000
Auntie will always be by your side

16
00:01:57.066 --> 00:01:58.800
You're a brave girl.

17
00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:00.966
I see.

18
00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.566
You will always be strong

19
00:02:05.066 --> 00:02:05.966
Come on.

20
00:02:09.533 --> 00:02:10.333
Tianding

21
00:02:19.166 --> 00:02:21.566
Rice grain today is my daughter's big day

22
00:02:21.566 --> 00:02:22.466
What are you doing here?

23
00:02:22.466 --> 00:02:24.533
The security guard kicked the troublesome daughter out

24
00:02:24.533 --> 00:02:25.800
I'm not here to make trouble.

25
00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.366
I came to apologize

26
00:02:27.866 --> 00:02:30.766
Tingting, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

27
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.900
It's all my aunt's fault for being so vain

28
00:02:33.366 --> 00:02:34.900
Until your dad left

29
00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.900
I just realized how good he is

30
00:02:37.266 --> 00:02:39.233
I can't do anything for you either.

31
00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.300
I heard you got married this year.

32
00:02:41.533 --> 00:02:42.666
My Future

33
00:02:42.666 --> 00:02:43.833
Bless you.

34
00:02:44.533 --> 00:02:46.233
Can you forgive Auntie?

35
00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.800
Auntie has passed

36
00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:52.266
Thank you for coming to my wedding

37
00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:59.200
Dad?

38
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:01.600
I think you will come

39
00:03:02.133 --> 00:03:03.066
Right?
