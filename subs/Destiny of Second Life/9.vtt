00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:04.000
Leave it to my second son Zhao Yang

2
00:00:14.566 --> 00:00:15.900
My name is Zhao Yang.

3
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:21.000
Lord took this opportunity to make my will

4
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.000
I inherited

5
00:00:24.733 --> 00:00:26.033
This house

6
00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.166
And all my possessions

7
00:00:29.666 --> 00:00:32.400
They all belong to my daughter Zhao Ting

8
00:00:33.566 --> 00:00:35.933
If you send him to college, I'll have an abortion

9
00:00:35.933 --> 00:00:37.800
Don't take your son

10
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:02.200
Lili

11
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.300
I do it for our family

12
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.066
For you and the children

13
00:01:07.866 --> 00:01:09.666
I work three jobs a day

14
00:01:09.666 --> 00:01:11.800
I was busy from morning till night.

15
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.166
I only sleep two hours a day.

16
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.766
I raise me raise your mother

17
00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.066
Your family eats and drinks

18
00:01:20.066 --> 00:01:23.100
It's all my hard-earned money that stays up late

19
00:01:23.166 --> 00:01:26.300
I just took out a little bit of money

20
00:01:26.466 --> 00:01:28.066
To send my daughter to college

21
00:01:28.366 --> 00:01:30.766
Why can't you stop?

22
00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:33.533
Do you still want to live these days?

23
00:01:33.533 --> 00:01:35.200
Believe it or not, I will divorce you now.

24
00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.500
I don't want this child anymore

25
00:01:37.566 --> 00:01:40.966
Hey, Lili, don't be angry, okay?

26
00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.266
Be careful child

27
00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.533
Ok you wait

28
00:01:47.533 --> 00:01:49.466
What are you doing?

29
00:01:49.466 --> 00:01:50.766
I'm going to find your mother

30
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.266
Let him judge me

31
00:01:52.266 --> 00:01:54.266
Don't go to my mom

32
00:01:54.266 --> 00:01:55.733
My mom has coronary heart disease

33
00:01:55.733 --> 00:01:57.100
He can't get excited.

34
00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.533
Okay, he can't get excited, I can get excited.

35
00:02:00.533 --> 00:02:02.666
Am I going to find him?

36
00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:06.866
Don't threaten me with my mother every time something happens

37
00:02:06.866 --> 00:02:10.033
I just threatened you with him. What's the matter?

38
00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:11.966
This day can't pass

39
00:02:12.066 --> 00:02:13.400
If you don't listen to me

40
00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:14.933
I'm going to make trouble in front of your mother

41
00:02:14.933 --> 00:02:17.400
See if he is like you or me

42
00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.066
Okay, okay.

43
00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:24.066
I was wrong, okay?

44
00:02:26.333 --> 00:02:27.900
I was wrong.

45
00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.500
I shouldn't have been nice to you

46
00:02:32.166 --> 00:02:35.000
You can punish me however you want, but

47
00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:39.633
Going to college is Tingting's dream

48
00:02:40.133 --> 00:02:41.566
I beg you.

49
00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:42.866
Help Tingting

50
00:02:43.966 --> 00:02:45.900
Make this wish come true, okay?

51
00:02:45.933 --> 00:02:47.633
I can punish you however I want.

52
00:02:50.133 --> 00:02:51.766
Then you kneel down

53
00:02:51.766 --> 00:02:52.566
learn

54
00:02:53.266 --> 00:02:55.166
School until I end

55
00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.266
Why don't you want to

56
00:02:59.666 --> 00:03:02.866
If you don't have face, then don't talk about it all

57
00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:07.200
Ok I kneel I don't listen

58
00:03:11.866 --> 00:03:12.966

00:03:15.366 --> 00:03:16.400
Dad is ok

60
00:03:18.266 --> 00:03:20.266
As long as you can achieve your dreams

61
00:03:20.933 --> 00:03:23.100
It's okay to be afraid of being wronged

62
00:03:27.933 --> 00:03:28.833
He knelt

63
00:03:29.733 --> 00:03:30.333
Kneel

64
00:03:30.333 --> 00:03:31.133
Do not kneel

65
00:03:32.133 --> 00:03:33.766
Why did you go with him?

66
00:03:47.966 --> 00:03:49.000
Call

67
00:03:51.366 --> 00:03:52.433

68
00:03:53.466 --> 00:03:54.700

69
00:03:55.733 --> 00:03:56.700
Louder.

70
00:03:57.266 --> 00:03:58.700
I can't hear you.

71
00:03:58.766 --> 00:03:59.966
Mom Buwen

72
00:03:59.966 --> 00:04:01.066
Art Mom

73
00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:02.600

76
00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:08.600
Mom

77
00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:10.400
Why is that?

78
00:04:11.933 --> 00:04:15.400
Why did they sacrifice this family to do it?

79
00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:18.233
The man who respects everything

80
00:04:18.966 --> 00:04:20.433
Say I like you

81
00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:23.833
Why did you bully him in front of him?

82
00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:26.366
Why is that?

83
00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:28.866
You are no longer my father

84
00:04:29.866 --> 00:04:32.500
You're not my dad anymore

85
00:04:49.966 --> 00:04:51.700
My dad has already established a place

86
00:04:54.666 --> 00:04:56.633
All property in his name

87
00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:59.066
It's all mine.
