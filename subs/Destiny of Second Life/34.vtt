It should be blood

17
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.066
I guess with that big needle

18
00:00:42.066 --> 00:00:43.166
Pull the marrow out

How can surgery have no effect on the body?

30
00:01:06.933 --> 00:01:09.333
It is impossible for me to risk my life

31
00:01:09.333 --> 00:01:10.566
Healthy to take risks

32
00:01:10.566 --> 00:01:12.333
