00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.866
When you came to believe

2
00:00:03.533 --> 00:00:06.100
You were my best friend back then

3
00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:08.433
I can't lose you again

4
00:00:09.166 --> 00:00:12.833
I can't lose the letter anymore, can you come by yourself?

5
00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:19.566
Doctor doctor doctor you go

6
00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:20.900
Happy Doctor

7
00:00:21.066 --> 00:00:22.633
Please help me

8
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.800
He -- he came back to life today.

9
00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.166
Quick rescue

10
00:00:31.933 --> 00:00:34.233
After a day and a night of rescue

11
00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:36.966
Sonny is finally out of danger

12
00:00:37.266 --> 00:00:40.866
The doctor said it was an absolute medical miracle

13
00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.533
It's all about survival.

14
00:00:43.533 --> 00:00:44.966
Just got through

15
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.633
You are missing me

16
00:00:59.766 --> 00:01:02.200
Because of the video of Sonny Fighting Bad Dog Employer

17
00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.666
It was photographed by passers-by and posted online

18
00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:06.000
The video exploded

19
00:01:06.666 --> 00:01:08.766
Sonny became an Internet celebrity

20
00:01:08.766 --> 00:01:10.433
Received social attention

21
00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:11.966
Because of Sonny's heat

22
00:01:11.966 --> 00:01:14.200
It had a huge social impact.

23
00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.133
Let a large number of people represented by Zhang Biao

24
00:01:16.133 --> 00:01:17.500
illegal loan company

25
00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:18.866
It was terminated.

26
00:01:19.066 --> 00:01:20.900
Although since that day

27
00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.866
Sonny is acting like a dog again

28
00:01:24.466 --> 00:01:25.800
But it doesn't matter.

29
00:01:25.966 --> 00:01:27.600
Just be with Sonny

30
00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.666
I feel like my dad is by my side

31
00:01:31.466 --> 00:01:32.100
Hello

32
00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.400
My house is two months old and it hasn't been sold yet?

33
00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.900
Sorry about that.

34
00:01:37.266 --> 00:01:39.500
The house is not doing well recently

35
00:01:39.666 --> 00:01:42.400
Your house is a bit difficult to handle

36
00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.066
I really can't, I can be cheaper.

37
00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:47.300
It's not that it's not cheap.

38
00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.200
Your house is a typical old and run-down house.

39
00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:52.433
undivided period

40
00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:53.700
Full payment only.

41
00:01:53.966 --> 00:01:55.466
A house like yours

42
00:01:56.133 --> 00:01:57.966
Hard to sell

43
00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.000
Tingting is going to college next month

44
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.133
Tuition hasn't settled yet

45
00:02:01.133 --> 00:02:02.700
What can be done?

46
00:02:03.366 --> 00:02:05.533
How about our intermediary?

47
00:02:05.533 --> 00:02:07.800
Also help others with loan business

48
00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.433
Do you want a loan?

49
00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:12.700
But I'm not very good at credit investigation.

50
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.866
That's okay.

51
00:02:13.866 --> 00:02:16.500
I do know a few small loan companies

52
00:02:16.566 --> 00:02:19.733
Don't check the credit, is this the interest?

53
00:02:19.733 --> 00:02:22.300
Please think about it.
