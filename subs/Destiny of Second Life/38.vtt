1
00:00:04.766 --> 00:00:05.600
Doctor

2
00:00:06.666 --> 00:00:07.900
What's wrong with him?

3
00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:10.300
Your dog has a tumor in his brain.

4
00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:12.666
Fell into a coma due to tumor compression

5
00:00:12.766 --> 00:00:13.700
tumor

6
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.300
How can there be a tumor?

7
00:00:16.966 --> 00:00:19.900
Can it be cured? I'm too old for that.

8
00:00:20.133 --> 00:00:21.766
Treatment doesn't make much sense anymore

9
00:00:21.766 --> 00:00:23.366
It is recommended to give up treatment

10
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.433
Impossible to give up treatment

11
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.000
How much will I cure him?

12
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:27.800
That's impossible.

13
00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.400
Doctor, you have to help me. You have to help me.

14
00:00:30.466 --> 00:00:33.566
Tingting, calm down and don't be impulsive.

15
00:00:33.866 --> 00:00:35.400
Be careful with your body

16
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.600
How long can a doctor live in three days?

17
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:39.666
It's hard to say.

18
00:00:39.666 --> 00:00:42.633
According to the current situation, it shouldn't be too long.

19
00:00:42.733 --> 00:00:44.833
About 3 months.

20
00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:46.766
When will he wake up?

21
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:48.900
It's hard to say.

22
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.200
Maybe never wake up

23
00:01:06.166 --> 00:01:09.766
Bride, the wedding starts in 20 minutes.

24
00:01:09.766 --> 00:01:10.800
Got it.

25
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.566
It's been three days.

26
00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:20.400
Dad?

27
00:01:21.066 --> 00:01:23.633
If Sonny is really the angel you sent

28
00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.766
Please help him wake up.

29
00:01:31.733 --> 00:01:34.433
That bride is so beautiful today

30
00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.766
How can I be as beautiful as my daughter?

31
00:01:37.966 --> 00:01:42.066
Oops, I really don't know when you mess up in the future

32
00:01:42.266 --> 00:01:44.600
I'll call you to some brat

33
00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.366
You don't have a boyfriend, just forget about dad

34
00:01:49.366 --> 00:01:51.000
No way

35
00:01:51.333 --> 00:01:53.366
And I'm not sure I'll get married

36
00:01:53.366 --> 00:01:55.600
In case you don't find a suitable one

37
00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.300
Then I'm not alone

38
00:01:59.333 --> 00:02:01.766
How can a silly girl not get married?

39
00:02:01.766 --> 00:02:04.300
Don't worry, dad will check it for you.

40
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.766
When I put you in his hands?

41
00:02:07.766 --> 00:02:11.666
I'll also tell him I'll beat him if he bullies you

42
00:02:12.366 --> 00:02:15.866
Hahahaha

43
00:02:22.466 --> 00:02:24.966
I really hope you can come to my wedding

44
00:02:27.266 --> 00:02:28.700
You can see it.

45
00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:30.400
Right?
