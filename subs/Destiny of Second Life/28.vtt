00:00:00.766 --> 00:00:03.266
Thank you for always being there for me.

2
00:00:03.266 --> 00:00:06.700
After graduation I became a freelance screenwriter

3
00:00:06.933 --> 00:00:08.833
Every day at the computer desk

4
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.900
Write the stories I love

5
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.066
Free and fulfilled

6
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:25.466
Mom

7
00:00:25.933 --> 00:00:28.133
Don't cook so many big fish and meat every day.

8
00:00:28.133 --> 00:00:28.933
Will it work?

9
00:00:28.933 --> 00:00:30.600
I'm getting angry now

10
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.266
I'm still angry

11
00:00:33.266 --> 00:00:35.000
I know how to play computer every day

12
00:00:35.166 --> 00:00:36.933
Not to mention finding a boyfriend

13
00:00:36.933 --> 00:00:39.033
This is my job, okay?

14
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.466
Besides, I'm still young, so I'm not in a hurry to find someone.

15
00:00:43.166 --> 00:00:46.266
You're still young, you're 28

16
00:00:47.066 --> 00:00:49.800
I saw your high school classmate Zhang Xinyue a few days ago

17
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.066
The kid ran all over the place

18
00:00:53.133 --> 00:00:55.366
Don't worry about my business.

19
00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:56.700
I don't worry.

20
00:00:56.966 --> 00:00:59.300
You can't get married after 30

21
00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.766
How nice of you to introduce a young man to you soon?

22
00:01:02.933 --> 00:01:04.400
Civil servants?

23
00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:05.766
Parents also have pensions

24
00:01:05.933 --> 00:01:07.266
You have to

25
00:01:08.866 --> 00:01:10.966
I'm so sick, I'm going out

26
00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:20.600
Hey hey hey my paper

27
00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.066
Beautiful woman, come and sign up

28
00:01:23.066 --> 00:01:25.066
What are you doing?

29
00:01:27.733 --> 00:01:30.466
You also think I can't find a partner, right?

30
00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.900
Where are you going? Where are you going?

31
00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.300
Sorry sorry me
