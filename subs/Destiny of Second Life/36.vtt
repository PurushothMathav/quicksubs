00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.100
Hey

2
00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:03.000
uncle

3
00:00:03.933 --> 00:00:04.733
uncle

4
00:00:12.166 --> 00:00:15.400
Auntie, let's go to the hospital quickly!

5
00:00:16.666 --> 00:00:19.166
What are you doing? Get in the car

6
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:39.366
Hold on.

7
00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:40.600
School is coming soon

8
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.500
Go to school and study hard

9
00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.300
Only with culture will there be success in the future

10
00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.233
Brother, do you really not go to school with such good grades?

11
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.633
Limited conditions at home

12
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.200
I can't just watch you two do math

13
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.000
Go to school and study hard

14
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.300
Fulfill my brother's dream

15
00:00:55.333 --> 00:00:57.766
Brother, I will definitely study hard

16
00:00:57.766 --> 00:01:01.600
I will take care of you in the future, good brother, I believe in you.

17
00:01:04.333 --> 00:01:06.466
But you've always taken good care of me

18
00:01:07.166 --> 00:01:09.066
I remember when I was a child

19
00:01:09.566 --> 00:01:11.200
I'm a coward.

20
00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:14.200
Every time I see myself being bullied by others

21
00:01:14.533 --> 00:01:16.566
My brother will stand up for me

22
00:01:17.166 --> 00:01:18.666
Mom and Dad left early

23
00:01:19.733 --> 00:01:22.100
It's my brother who has been taking care of us

24
00:01:22.966 --> 00:01:24.100
In my eyes

25
00:01:25.933 --> 00:01:27.666
Just like my father did.

26
00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.700
Brother, as long as there is anything delicious

27
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.500
Give it all to me

28
00:01:31.666 --> 00:01:33.400
He doesn't want a single bite.

29
00:01:35.533 --> 00:01:36.566
You grew up

30
00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.200
Don't let us suffer a little grievance

31
00:01:40.333 --> 00:01:43.666
Now I just have to look at his daughter

32
00:01:45.133 --> 00:01:46.700
Am I still human?

33
00:01:52.666 --> 00:01:56.966
They are all alive and impersonal, haha.

34
00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.433
Hahahaha

35
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:04.800
Ah!

36
00:02:05.366 --> 00:02:07.433
Ha ha.

37
00:02:14.333 --> 00:02:17.700
The doctor said that the condition is progressing rapidly today

38
00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:21.166
The treatment plan is still partial, it has always been better

39
00:02:21.666 --> 00:02:23.800
After all, there is news from their house

40
00:02:30.066 --> 00:02:31.166
My mom has hope

41
00:02:31.666 --> 00:02:33.666
I have been able to go to major villages now

42
00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:35.433
Once you have the right background

43
00:02:35.933 --> 00:02:37.566
They will contact us immediately

44
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.666
It's not my fault

45
00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.000
If I hadn't left poverty behind when I was young

46
00:02:43.566 --> 00:02:45.433
I won't suffer this crime

47
00:02:47.066 --> 00:02:47.866
Ah!

48
00:02:48.466 --> 00:02:49.266
No.
