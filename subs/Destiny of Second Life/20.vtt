00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:02.000
Where to run

2
00:00:06.566 --> 00:00:08.533
This dog is going to bite again

3
00:00:08.533 --> 00:00:10.700
If I want to get bitten by a mad dog, just leave

4
00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:13.266
Do you think it's great to have a mad dog?

5
00:00:13.266 --> 00:00:14.566
Is there nothing we can do?

6
00:00:15.066 --> 00:00:16.900
Go bring the zone down

7
00:00:34.066 --> 00:00:35.200
Hahahaha

8
00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.000
Is it cool to have a dog?

9
00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.000
I'll give you a tougher one today.

10
00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:40.700
Purebred authorization

11
00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:42.833
This dog

12
00:00:42.966 --> 00:00:46.100
I'll bite you to death in 3 minutes, hahaha.

13
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.033
Yeah, this dog is pretty cool.

14
00:00:52.066 --> 00:00:53.066
Bulldog

15
00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.266
Don't you have to be scared to pee yet?

16
00:00:55.966 --> 00:00:58.366
I'll see if you still call out later.

17
00:00:58.666 --> 00:01:00.566
Don't spare him for me

18
00:01:04.866 --> 00:01:08.600
Wait for you, wait for you, don't wait for you.

19
00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:27.866
Hahahaha

20
00:01:32.966 --> 00:01:34.066
Hahahaha

21
00:01:34.266 --> 00:01:35.866
Bronze Buddha is earth

22
00:01:35.966 --> 00:01:38.500
As soon as you come up, press Neil on the ground and rub it

23
00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.633
Haha, yes, yes.

24
00:01:40.733 --> 00:01:41.666
Don't bite

25
00:01:42.366 --> 00:01:43.166
Don't bite

26
00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.233
Don't bite my distractions

27
00:01:45.666 --> 00:01:48.266
Hey, hey, oops.

28
00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.100
This mouth is quite high and will not admit defeat

29
00:01:51.866 --> 00:01:53.066
That didn't work either

30
00:01:53.366 --> 00:01:55.100
There is a gap in inborn experience

31
00:01:55.566 --> 00:01:57.033
Pet dogs can't beat dogs

32
00:01:58.366 --> 00:02:00.533
Strange, is this a pet dog?

33
00:02:00.533 --> 00:02:02.966
Why are you so bitten all over?

34
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.900
Yeah, why is this pet dog stronger than a fighting dog?

35
00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:07.433
As if not afraid of death

36
00:02:07.966 --> 00:02:10.333
Let you cheer let you cheer

37
00:02:10.333 --> 00:02:12.633
Let you cheer let you cheer

38
00:02:12.666 --> 00:02:13.800
Let you cheer

39
00:02:14.366 --> 00:02:16.233
Let him let him

40
00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.000
I go I go

41
00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:19.500
This dog is too tough

42
00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:20.733
You can't seem to take it anymore.

43
00:02:20.733 --> 00:02:22.100
Since we seem to have deposited money

44
00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:23.533
Deliberately forcing the front leg to bite

45
00:02:23.533 --> 00:02:25.033
Then let him scream to death

46
00:02:27.733 --> 00:02:29.433
Hey, don't run

47
00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.333
Mad dog, this is definitely a mad dog, cousin, run

48
00:02:38.333 --> 00:02:39.466
Are you going to kill?

49
00:02:58.366 --> 00:02:59.300
Life
