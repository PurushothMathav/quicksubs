Now we continue the performance of the genius dog

5
00:00:14.533 --> 00:00:16.900
How much is this question equal to?

6
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.400
My dog can do math

7
00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.033
Isn't that amazing?

8
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:28.266
Awesome dog!

9
00:00:29.733 --> 00:00:30.866
Such a simple question

10
00:00:30.866 --> 00:00:32.900
It can be done with training.

11
00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:34.300
No big deal.

12
00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:34.933
This

13
00:00:34.933 --> 00:00:37.400
This netizen thinks this inscription is too simple, right?

14
00:00:44.733 --> 00:00:47.133
God, he can even be punished.

15
00:00:47.133 --> 00:00:48.800
What a genius

16
00:00:49.366 --> 00:00:51.200
The dog is awesome

17
00:00:51.733 --> 00:00:53.100
Dogs are awesome

18
00:00:54.166 --> 00:00:56.933
The fake must have been trained in advance

19
00:00:56.933 --> 00:00:58.700
He knows a few questions

20
00:00:59.466 --> 00:01:00.933
Before some netizens said

21
00:01:00.933 --> 00:01:04.400
Our family will only train the topics in advance in three years.

22
00:01:04.566 --> 00:01:07.733
Now please ask netizens to ask questions on the spot

23
00:01:07.733 --> 00:01:09.633
We used to answer on the spot, okay?

24
00:01:09.933 --> 00:01:13.433
Uh, this netizen auspicious number said

25
00:01:13.666 --> 00:01:16.100
What is 3 times 5?

26
00:01:19.533 --> 00:01:22.566
Haha, my sister-in-law said it was 15.

27
00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.500
The flying pig said

28
00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:30.166
This online friend is too much.

29
00:01:30.166 --> 00:01:31.866
How hard is this kitchen?

30
00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.166
3 meters is equal to 9.

31
00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:38.700
Did you see it?

32
00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.600
Not to mention our kitchen

33
00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:44.100
Hey, this netizen named Kun Kun said

34
00:01:44.266 --> 00:01:47.233
93 times 96.

35
00:01:47.766 --> 00:01:50.166
Hey, you're a bit too much, aren't you?

36
00:01:50.166 --> 00:01:52.866
As long as you ask this question, I can't count it in a short time

37
00:01:58.333 --> 00:02:01.300
Is 8928 8928?

38
00:02:01.466 --> 00:02:03.166
8928 is correct
