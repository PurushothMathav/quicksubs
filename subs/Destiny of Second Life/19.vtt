00:00:04.266 --> 00:00:05.700
Don't touch my daughter

2
00:00:10.533 --> 00:00:11.600
This dog is fierce

3
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:12.700
It bites.

4
00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:14.366
Are you afraid of wool?

5
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.200
This dog doesn't bite at all

6
00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:18.200
bluff for me

7
00:00:23.066 --> 00:00:24.166
You two losers

8
00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:27.533
Don't look a little abnormal

9
00:00:27.533 --> 00:00:28.666
Look at him so fierce

10
00:00:28.666 --> 00:00:29.766
And he was drooling.

11
00:00:29.933 --> 00:00:32.300
Is he a mad dog?

12
00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:33.800
If he bites

13
00:00:33.866 --> 00:00:35.900
That's awesome. Bake cold noodles? No

14
00:00:59.066 --> 00:01:02.300
So brave today

15
00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:03.666
Stay away from him

16
00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:04.966
Didn't you hear them?

17
00:01:04.966 --> 00:01:06.133
He has rabies

18
00:01:06.133 --> 00:01:07.733
He doesn't have mad blood

19
00:01:07.733 --> 00:01:09.566
He's been vaccinated like never before

20
00:01:09.566 --> 00:01:11.400
But they just said

21
00:01:11.866 --> 00:01:13.533
Auntie, didn't you see it?

22
00:01:13.533 --> 00:01:15.666
He was pretending just now

23
00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:18.100
You are a dog and I am so smart

24
00:01:19.933 --> 00:01:21.400
Oops, hurry up

25
00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:22.900
Those guys will be back

26
00:01:23.133 --> 00:01:23.666
daughter

27
00:01:23.666 --> 00:01:25.766
What does this have to do with us?

28
00:01:25.766 --> 00:01:27.300
Those people are not easy to mess with at first glance

29
00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:28.433
We have to go out and hide

30
00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:29.800
Okay, stop talking

31
00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.600
Let's go, let's go, walk home

32
00:02:04.133 --> 00:02:05.866
Run yearning for that run
