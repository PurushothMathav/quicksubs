1
00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:05.233
I've made up my mind.

2
00:00:06.766 --> 00:00:07.966
I don't follow anyone

3
00:00:12.533 --> 00:00:14.066
What is this talking about?

4
00:00:14.066 --> 00:00:16.500
Is this a joke? I'm not kidding.

5
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.300
I am already 18 years old.

6
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.066
I can live alone

7
00:00:20.066 --> 00:00:23.133
Pull it down, you child, what are you living alone?

8
00:00:23.133 --> 00:00:25.166
Ah, isn't it noisy?

9
00:00:25.266 --> 00:00:27.133
Yeah, stop fooling around.

10
00:00:27.133 --> 00:00:29.566
You may be 18, but you are still a child

11
00:00:29.733 --> 00:00:31.666
You don't have to persuade me anymore

12
00:00:32.566 --> 00:00:35.000
I will live alone from today on

13
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
I will strengthen myself

14
00:00:37.066 --> 00:00:38.266
Oops, it's just nonsense

15
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:39.700
No, absolutely not.

16
00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:40.900
You as a child

17
00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:41.900
That property of yours

18
00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.800
It should be left to us adults for safekeeping.

19
00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.033
You can't help it.

20
00:00:48.366 --> 00:00:49.766
Hey, hey, hey.

21
00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:51.400
Yeah.

22
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.766
The house is mine

23
00:00:54.266 --> 00:00:55.766
Let go of mom

24
00:00:55.766 --> 00:00:58.000
You all give me stability

25
00:00:58.533 --> 00:00:59.400
Let's go

26
00:01:01.733 --> 00:01:02.533
Bar

27
00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.266
Dad's savings

28
00:01:22.866 --> 00:01:24.066
Funeral expenses

29
00:01:24.733 --> 00:01:26.633
Basically transferred away by the stepmother

30
00:01:27.866 --> 00:01:30.666
For such a small amount of money, let alone going to college

31
00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.866
Even life can't be guaranteed

32
00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.666
I really want to sell my house

33
00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.066
The house is the only face of my dad

34
00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:40.800
Can't sell
