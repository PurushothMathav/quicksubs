00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:04.400
Hey wait a minute

2
00:00:04.733 --> 00:00:06.433
Here's a thousand in change.

3
00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:08.400
Why do you want to pay us back?

4
00:00:08.533 --> 00:00:09.800
Zhao Yang is my husband

5
00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:12.100
My husband's property is mine

6
00:00:12.266 --> 00:00:15.066
He said nonsense that Zhao Yang was dead

7
00:00:15.066 --> 00:00:16.766
And the property is all divided

8
00:00:16.766 --> 00:00:18.766
This doesn't belong to you.

9
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:19.700
aunt

10
00:00:20.133 --> 00:00:22.266
My dad was so good to you when he was alive

11
00:00:22.266 --> 00:00:24.066
Always single-minded

12
00:00:24.333 --> 00:00:25.766
Can you look at his face?

13
00:00:25.766 --> 00:00:27.700
Can you let us go?

14
00:00:28.133 --> 00:00:29.833
I can't help it either.

15
00:00:29.966 --> 00:00:31.300
I got ripped off.

16
00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.000
Wang Shuai said to take me to do business

17
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.766
Let me guarantee his loan

18
00:00:34.866 --> 00:00:37.166
But I didn't expect him to run away

19
00:00:39.066 --> 00:00:40.533
You can help auntie once

20
00:00:40.533 --> 00:00:42.366
Auntie will definitely pay you back.

21
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:44.200
You go away

22
00:00:44.333 --> 00:00:47.133
Why should we help you pay it back? And you

23
00:00:47.133 --> 00:00:49.466
I tell you we won't give it.

24
00:00:49.933 --> 00:00:50.866
Hurry up and leave

25
00:00:50.866 --> 00:00:52.433
I'm leaving, I'm calling the police

26
00:00:53.333 --> 00:00:55.700
Fucking bitch still wants to default

27
00:00:56.066 --> 00:00:59.166
Tell me that there is no unspeakable battle on the road

28
00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.200
Gotta go back today

29
00:01:04.066 --> 00:01:04.900
Hey

30
00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:06.300
Yeah.

31
00:01:08.866 --> 00:01:10.266
This is for you 100,000 give me some

32
00:01:11.133 --> 00:01:12.833
Hello, Zhao Yang

33
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.966
Dare to hide private money behind my back

34
00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:16.466
Cousin put him away

35
00:01:16.466 --> 00:01:19.166
No, that's my daughter's school money.

36
00:01:19.166 --> 00:01:20.366
You can't take it.

37
00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.466
Go to your sister

38
00:01:22.666 --> 00:01:24.300
Damn it, steal money from me

39
00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:26.033
Brother Ming has a house

40
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.133

How do we have that kind of money?

44
00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.666
No.

45
00:01:37.666 --> 00:01:40.400
This house is what I married and left to my daughter

46
00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:41.833
You can't take it.

47
00:01:41.966 --> 00:01:45.000
Stop talking nonsense and say you can receive it if you can.

48
00:01:47.166 --> 00:01:49.100
The daughter looks good

49
00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:50.966
What are you doing?

50
00:01:50.966 --> 00:01:52.533
What's coming at me?

51
00:01:52.533 --> 00:01:55.400
Go to this old lady you shit

52
00:01:56.133 --> 00:01:57.866
This girl is not bad looking.

53
00:01:58.266 --> 00:02:02.066
Go and pull me to the store to accompany the wine to pay off the debt

54
00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:05.100
Leave him alone!

55
00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.666
As long as he is, I will want it.

56
00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:08.433
let go
