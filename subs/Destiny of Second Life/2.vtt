00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:01.466
Hahahahaha

2
00:00:02.333 --> 00:00:06.866
Hahahahaha

3
00:00:07.366 --> 00:00:09.233
Hahahaha

4
00:00:09.766 --> 00:00:10.833
I was wrong.

5
00:00:13.366 --> 00:00:15.600
I'm not going to college

6
00:00:17.133 --> 00:00:18.666
Don't do this

7
00:00:19.466 --> 00:00:22.766
Don't scare me, wake up

8
00:00:23.566 --> 00:00:27.366
Don't be in trouble, dad, my good boy.

9
00:00:27.366 --> 00:00:30.400
Dad, I will definitely be back

10
00:00:32.266 --> 00:00:35.433
The situation is very dangerous and requires immediate surgery

11
00:00:35.733 --> 00:00:36.633
Doctor

12
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.366
How much will the treatment cost? Can it be cured?

13
00:00:40.366 --> 00:00:43.066
Treatment costs about 200,000

14
00:00:43.333 --> 00:00:45.900
Can it be cured? It's uncomfortable.

15
00:00:46.166 --> 00:00:50.666
200,000 may not be able to cure that

16
00:00:51.933 --> 00:00:54.566
Me, my doctor.

17
00:00:54.733 --> 00:00:56.066
I beg you

18
00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.166
Doctor, I'm begging you

19
00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.366
You must cure my father

20
00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.333
I beg you, can I kowtow to you?

21
00:01:02.333 --> 00:01:03.466
I kowtow to you

22
00:01:04.266 --> 00:01:06.366
No please doctor

23
00:01:17.866 --> 00:01:19.300
You are useless

24
00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:22.233
If you want to save him, you have to pay for treatment.

25
00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:26.066
aunt

26
00:01:27.666 --> 00:01:28.466
Please!

27
00:01:29.366 --> 00:01:30.600
Save my dad

28
00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.300
I was wrong I was really wrong

29
00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:34.900
I will never go to college again

30
00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:36.500
I'm not going to school, okay?

31
00:01:36.933 --> 00:01:39.233
Please save him

32
00:01:39.566 --> 00:01:41.633
I know I understand

33
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.166
Ah, that's it.

34
00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.300
Oops oops me

35
00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.400
You husband and wife

36
00:01:57.533 --> 00:02:02.633
Don't joke with your life, hahaha.

37
00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:06.866
Hahahahaha

38
00:02:07.733 --> 00:02:12.166
I don't have a real piece of paper here hahaha

39
00:02:17.266 --> 00:02:20.000
Old things don't take it out sooner if they have money

40
00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.066
The patient's current condition

41
00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.500
Even if it is cured, it will lose the ability to move

42
00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.066
I will be in a wheelchair for the rest of my life

43
00:02:31.666 --> 00:02:33.766
I can't make money and want me to serve him

44
00:02:33.866 --> 00:02:35.100
Whether to treat

45
00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.500
Think about it.

46
00:02:38.533 --> 00:02:39.333
Ah!

47
00:02:40.333 --> 00:02:44.633
Haha, you respect hahaha, since you can't save it.

48
00:02:44.733 --> 00:02:47.566
Then cupping and letting him go

49
00:02:47.866 --> 00:02:49.800
Grandma wants

50
00:02:50.666 --> 00:02:51.966
Hahaha can't die

51
00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:54.566
Let go haha

52
00:02:54.966 --> 00:02:56.900
Ha, it's doable to die

53
00:02:58.533 --> 00:03:02.166
You and our emotions are so fragile

54
00:03:02.366 --> 00:03:04.200
Am I so useless?

55
00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:05.100
mine

56
00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.666
Really can't live without dad

57
00:03:08.366 --> 00:03:10.800
And our unborn son

58
00:03:11.566 --> 00:03:14.033
Uh-huh.

59
00:03:16.133 --> 00:03:16.933
grandma

60
00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.433
Is grandma okay?

61
00:03:19.466 --> 00:03:20.866
grandma

62
00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:23.600
grandma

63
00:03:24.066 --> 00:03:26.066
Did you send it?

64
00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:27.200
Ah!

65
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.800
Ah!

66
00:03:30.533 --> 00:03:31.333
Ah!

67
00:03:31.933 --> 00:03:32.733
Ah!

68
00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:36.600
Ah!

69
00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:38.500
Ah!

70
00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:39.900
Ah!

71
00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:48.433
Ah!

72
00:03:49.133 --> 00:03:50.500
Ah!

73
00:03:52.533 --> 00:03:53.500
Ah!

74
00:04:02.933 --> 00:04:03.766
Dad?

75
00:04:04.966 --> 00:04:07.100
Mom, don't scare me.

76
00:04:10.133 --> 00:04:11.033
Ah!

77
00:04:12.133 --> 00:04:14.300
Ah don't scare me

78
00:04:15.533 --> 00:04:17.000
Ahahaha

79
00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.333
Ah, don't scare me, don't scare me, you

80
00:04:20.333 --> 00:04:21.700
Don't want this

81
00:04:22.333 --> 00:04:23.233
Ah!

82
00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:32.100
Ah!

83
00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:33.866
I can't die.

84
00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:37.233
How did you leave my daughter behind?

85
00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:45.700
I beg you

86
00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:47.466
I beg you I can't die

87
00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.600
Give me another chance.

88
00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:51.900
I want to protect my daughter

89
00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:54.666
Good is good

90
00:04:55.266 --> 00:04:57.266
I can give you a chance.

91
00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:00.066
But you only have 10 years

92
00:05:00.066 --> 00:05:04.200
They cannot exist in human form.

93
00:05:04.466 --> 00:05:06.900
Would you like to?

94
00:05:07.166 --> 00:05:10.466
Yes, I do, I do, yes or no.

95
00:05:40.966 --> 00:05:41.866
Here you go.

96
00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:57.966
Whose dog is this?

97
00:06:06.066 --> 00:06:06.866
Go

98
00:06:08.866 --> 00:06:09.700
Go

99
00:06:12.133 --> 00:06:12.966
Go
