00:00:09.766 --> 00:00:12.200
Is the dog crying or kneeling?

2
00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.800
The dog is crying so pitifully, it's so heartbreaking.

3
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.400
Is sad-fishing all rolled up like this now?

4
00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:19.966
Dogs are on

5
00:00:20.466 --> 00:00:22.466
You troll is just brainless

6
00:00:22.466 --> 00:00:24.100
You train the dog sad-fishing and try it.

7
00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:26.333
If you can make the dog sad-fishing, I'll give you ten million

8
00:00:26.333 --> 00:00:27.900
Everything has a spirit

9
00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.800
There are still such righteous dogs in the world

10
00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.100
It seems that the live streaming host is really encountering difficulties.

11
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:33.866
A yacht to flirt with

12
00:00:43.066 --> 00:00:45.633
Thank you, thank you netizens for your gifts.

13
00:00:45.666 --> 00:00:48.766
Thank you. I love this dog.

14
00:00:48.766 --> 00:00:50.266
I 100,000 sell it to me

15
00:00:50.266 --> 00:00:52.666
I 200,000 I 500,000

16
00:00:55.166 --> 00:00:56.733
Sonny is our family

17
00:00:56.733 --> 00:00:58.433
I don't sell it for much.

18
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.333
How did you raise such an obedient dog?

19
00:01:02.333 --> 00:01:05.200
Our dog knows how to eat and sleep

20
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.200
Look at this, everyone, look at that dog

21
00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.300
Damn, this dog is so fierce that he can learn

22
00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:23.166
true or false?

23
00:01:23.166 --> 00:01:25.266
What will dogs learn?

24
00:01:25.266 --> 00:01:26.966
Dogs change classes

25
00:01:26.966 --> 00:01:28.600
This dog is a genius

26
00:01:35.333 --> 00:01:37.066
This dog studies so seriously.

27
00:01:37.066 --> 00:01:39.833
So cute, what kind of learning artifact is this?

28
00:01:40.133 --> 00:01:42.033
Even dogs have become eager to learn

29
00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.800
Your dog is so smart

30
00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:46.233
It has to do with the learning machine.

31
00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:48.633
Hey

32
00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:52.900
And so it did.

33
00:01:52.966 --> 00:01:56.333
The reason why dogs are smart is that learning machines can't draw

34
00:01:56.333 --> 00:01:57.500
Placed an order

35
00:01:58.166 --> 00:01:59.233
Placed an order

36
00:02:00.066 --> 00:02:01.100
Placed an order

37
00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.600
The blogger wants to place an order and there is no stock.

38
00:02:06.533 --> 00:02:08.300
Ah wait a minute

39
00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.866
I will contact the manufacturer to stock up now.
