00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.466
Don't think about arguing anymore

2
00:00:02.466 --> 00:00:04.466
Think about it quietly

3
00:00:04.466 --> 00:00:07.233
Tingting, this child must have a place to fall into the swamp

4
00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:11.966
Hey, this Tingting is already 18 years old and an adult

5
00:00:11.966 --> 00:00:14.133
No need for anyone to come over, let me see

6
00:00:14.133 --> 00:00:15.733
Go out and burp

7
00:00:15.733 --> 00:00:16.666
Make some money

8
00:00:16.666 --> 00:00:19.700
I'm not going, I'm going to college

9
00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:21.133
What university are you going to?

10
00:00:21.133 --> 00:00:22.700
Who paid for your college education?

11
00:00:22.733 --> 00:00:25.166
It is better to go out to work as soon as possible to earn money and get married

12
00:00:25.166 --> 00:00:26.033
get married

13
00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.266
That's a good idea.

14
00:00:28.366 --> 00:00:30.700
Can you still get a bride price?

15
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:34.033
Brother, I like you.

16
00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.566
You think it's good in our village

17
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.366
Is there money at home?

18
00:00:38.366 --> 00:00:41.766
Just like that, you can still marry a wife in your 40s

19
00:00:41.966 --> 00:00:43.600
Hey, you're good

20
00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:44.833
I'll talk about it later

21
00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:46.933
You have a bit of a good attitude

22
00:00:46.933 --> 00:00:49.300
Hahaha, my dad's accident is not over

23
00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.900
Don't you just say that your father is a poet?

24
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.933
I don't care. I'm going to college.

25
00:00:53.933 --> 00:00:55.966
Mom, I'm going to college.

26
00:00:58.533 --> 00:00:59.333
Tingting

27
00:00:59.933 --> 00:01:01.400
Mom's conditions are also limited

28
00:01:01.533 --> 00:01:02.966
You have a younger brother to support

29
00:01:02.966 --> 00:01:04.766
I can't send you to college.

30
00:01:05.366 --> 00:01:08.066
Getting married early is also a good way out

31
00:01:09.166 --> 00:01:11.566
But Tingting's marriage must be decided by me

32
00:01:11.733 --> 00:01:12.966
The dowry is mine

33
00:01:12.966 --> 00:01:14.366
You think beautifully

34
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.200
Marrying you is the seed of our old Zhao family

35
00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.366
Now I remember that he is the seed of the old Zhao family

36
00:01:18.366 --> 00:01:20.200
Is he still the meat that fell off me?

37
00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.166
It's impossible that this dowry is all ours

38
00:01:23.166 --> 00:01:25.333
Don't forget that my bride price is also half mine

39
00:01:25.333 --> 00:01:26.533
What am I, your wife?

40
00:01:26.533 --> 00:01:27.900
This is my baby.

41
00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.100
This is mine.

42
00:01:34.266 --> 00:01:36.300
Hahaha

43
00:01:36.866 --> 00:01:37.766
Dad?

44
00:01:38.733 --> 00:01:41.266
Dad, where are you?

45
00:01:55.066 --> 00:01:56.200
What is this?

46
00:01:57.166 --> 00:01:58.633
Where are you from?

47
00:02:06.266 --> 00:02:07.466
Notarized certificate

48
00:02:29.533 --> 00:02:32.366
My name is Zhao Weiguo

49
00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.100
ID number 232

50
00:02:47.866 --> 00:02:51.166
My old house in Dongcheng District

51
00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.466
The address is

52
00:02:54.533 --> 00:02:56.066
Dongcheng District

53
00:02:57.466 --> 00:02:59.400
No. 248

54
00:03:00.966 --> 00:03:02.766
Leave it to me at night

55
00:03:07.766 --> 00:03:09.600
I want to leave it to me

56
00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.066
Leave it to me

57
00:03:14.933 --> 00:03:16.433
Leave it to me
