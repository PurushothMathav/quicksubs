00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:05.300
What a coincidence!

2
00:00:11.733 --> 00:00:14.766
Where's the money? Give me the money

3
00:00:18.366 --> 00:00:21.466
Uncle, don't take it away, I'm mine

4
00:00:23.366 --> 00:00:24.666
Here you go.

5
00:00:26.166 --> 00:00:27.066
Stop

6
00:00:32.566 --> 00:00:33.766
What are you doing?

7
00:00:33.766 --> 00:00:35.833
What kind of relationship do you have with him?

8
00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:37.066
What, do you like him?

9
00:00:37.066 --> 00:00:38.200
You want to date him?

10
00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:39.633
We are just deskmates

11
00:00:39.733 --> 00:00:42.100
If you keep doing this, I'll be a teacher

12
00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:43.500
Take a look at me

13
00:00:43.666 --> 00:00:45.166
How dare you scare me with a teacher?

14
00:00:45.166 --> 00:00:47.233
Don't think I dare not hit you because you are a girl.

15
00:00:47.266 --> 00:00:48.433
What are you doing?

16
00:00:48.466 --> 00:00:51.066
Ouch, how dare you resist?

17
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:52.700
I'm him!

18
00:00:53.366 --> 00:00:54.766
Ah!

19
00:00:55.533 --> 00:00:56.333
Ah!

20
00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.100
Ah!

21
00:01:06.066 --> 00:01:06.866
Ah!

22
00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.600
How many of you fought, who moved first?

23
00:01:24.933 --> 00:01:27.700
It was Zhao Ting who beat us first

24
00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:28.800
They lie.

25
00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.133
The teacher was Zhou Tou who played first

26
00:01:31.133 --> 00:01:32.566
I said if they hit anyone again

27
00:01:32.566 --> 00:01:33.200
I will tell the teacher

28
00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.366
And they hit me.

29
00:01:34.366 --> 00:01:36.666
Is Zhoutou like this?

30
00:01:46.166 --> 00:01:47.800
Talk to me.

31
00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:51.500
Tingting

32
00:01:52.166 --> 00:01:55.266
I regret the memory

33
00:01:55.466 --> 00:01:56.500
At that time

34
00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:58.266
I was weak.

35
00:01:58.333 --> 00:01:59.866
It's all over

36
00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:05.233
I really want to make up for past mistakes

37
00:02:05.766 --> 00:02:07.166
Give me another chance.

38
00:02:07.466 --> 00:02:09.300
Okay? Okay?

39
00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:12.200
Then you can treat me to a meal of Malatang

40
00:02:12.666 --> 00:02:14.900
Ok of course no problem

41
00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.966
Fate is a wonderful thing.

42
00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.166
I got together with Zhou Tong

43
00:02:25.166 --> 00:02:27.666
Just when I said love is sweet

44
00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.900
Tingting

45
00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.700
Why is your nose bleeding?

46
00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.233
I-I've been a little pissed off lately

47
00:02:38.566 --> 00:02:40.633
Maybe the food is a little too greasy, really

48
00:02:41.066 --> 00:02:42.133
Are you really okay?

49
00:02:42.133 --> 00:02:43.200
Should I go to the hospital?

50
00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.800
It's really okay, it's really okay, it's really okay.

51
00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.233
Let's go. I want to eat Malatang.

52
00:02:49.966 --> 00:02:50.766
OK

53
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.833
Hey, be quiet.

54
00:02:55.466 --> 00:02:56.266
static

55
00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:04.966
How is my daughter?

56
00:03:05.533 --> 00:03:07.166
Your daughter is in bad shape

57
00:03:07.166 --> 00:03:09.300
She has lymphoblastic leukemia.

58
00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:10.800
It is recommended to treat as soon as possible

59
00:03:12.666 --> 00:03:13.666
leukemia
