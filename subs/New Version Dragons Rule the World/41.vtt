00:00:01.933 --> 00:00:02.966
How is that possible?

2
00:00:03.266 --> 00:00:04.066
How is that possible?

3
00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:06.633
All the money we made was wasted.

4
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.500
I'm not saying you should know

5
00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:12.166
These photos are all ways to donate to charity funds

6
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.566
It's almost seventy or eighty million

7
00:00:14.566 --> 00:00:15.333
What happened?

8
00:00:15.333 --> 00:00:18.300
Didn't spend a dime, just signed a dog head

9
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.366
Fang Dashao, are these true?

10
00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:23.900
Can you give me a reasonable explanation?

11
00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.000
Yes, Wang Zhixiang, we are rich.

12
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.533
But we are not stupid and have a lot of money

13
00:00:27.533 --> 00:00:28.566
Our money on the wheel

14
00:00:28.566 --> 00:00:30.033
Into your pocket

15
00:00:30.666 --> 00:00:33.000
Don't believe him, just make some stupid photos

16
00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:34.633
He clearly framed me

17
00:00:36.066 --> 00:00:36.933
What are you doing?

18
00:00:36.933 --> 00:00:37.733
What to eat?

19
00:00:37.733 --> 00:00:38.966
Do you think I am afraid of you?

20
00:00:38.966 --> 00:00:42.133
This last thing two options one

21
00:00:42.133 --> 00:00:43.700
Hand over the operation I want to hand in.

22
00:00:45.066 --> 00:00:45.866
message

23
00:00:46.166 --> 00:00:48.266
Hahaha, thank you.

24
00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:50.100
Why make the prince kneel

25
00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:51.433
Why should I die?

26
00:00:51.466 --> 00:00:54.266
Okay, I'll die like this

27
00:00:58.366 --> 00:01:00.300
These are the ones Hope Elementary accepts donations

28
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.100
In all games, there is no intention that belongs to you.

29
00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:05.700
