00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.500
Cooking oil over fire is too cheap for him

2
00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:04.366
Let the people from Punishment Hall come over

3
00:00:04.366 --> 00:00:06.466
I'm going to make his life worse than death

4
00:00:06.466 --> 00:00:09.066
Ahhh, help!

5
00:00:09.066 --> 00:00:11.733
Help, Yunyan is waiting for me

6
00:00:11.733 --> 00:00:14.466
Be sure to wait for me ah ah ah

7
00:00:16.866 --> 00:00:19.066
What's the matter, Miss Liu?

8
00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.833
Ah! Please! Please help me

9
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.066
I'm already pregnant.

10
00:00:25.066 --> 00:00:26.500
I can't do this surgery

11
00:00:26.533 --> 00:00:27.866
I am also a good life

12
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:29.400
I'm dead to nothing

13
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.933
Please save my child, Miss Liu

14
00:00:31.933 --> 00:00:33.300
I'm just a nurse

15
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.333
Ren Wenyan is clear

16
00:00:34.333 --> 00:00:35.300
Again

17
00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.500
Now the Chen family has taken control of the hospital

18
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:38.666
Up and down

19
00:00:39.066 --> 00:00:40.300
They are all from the Chen family

20
00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:41.700
I know you are a good person.

21
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.933
You were the one who took care of me when I first came to the hospital

22
00:00:43.933 --> 00:00:45.400
Please help me

23
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:50.700
Ji Yanyan

24
00:00:51.533 --> 00:00:52.566
What are you doing?

25
00:00:52.566 --> 00:00:53.800
Why don't you get anesthesia?

26
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.000
Dean

27
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.166
Isn't it bad for us to do this?

28
00:00:57.266 --> 00:01:00.033
Miss Liu is so pitiful

29
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:02.400
Poor fart

30
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:03.266
What is he?

31
00:01:03.266 --> 00:01:04.566
He's just a vessel.

32
00:01:04.566 --> 00:01:06.466
But he is pregnant

33
00:01:06.466 --> 00:01:07.633
Mingwan is not working

34
00:01:08.466 --> 00:01:10.966
How could there be someone like you in our hospital?

35
00:01:10.966 --> 00:01:12.000
Get out of here!

36
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.633
I'll clean you up later.

37
00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:16.000
Miss Liu

38
00:01:17.166 --> 00:01:18.300
Don't blame me.

39
00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.100
Blame it on your bad life

40
00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.166
Mrs. Chen is still waiting for your kidney to save her life

41
00:01:25.166 --> 00:01:26.700
If you hit, you will be quiet.

42
00:01:27.733 --> 00:01:28.533
Ah!

43
00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.866
Hahaha
