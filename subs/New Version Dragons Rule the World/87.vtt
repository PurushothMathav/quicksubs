00:00:01.366 --> 00:00:03.033
Hey, Xiao Liu, come, come, come

2
00:00:07.533 --> 00:00:10.166
I heard there are hundreds of people interviewing this year

3
00:00:10.166 --> 00:00:12.266
This interview is just one of them

4
00:00:12.266 --> 00:00:14.866
There are dozens of interviews on this entire floor

5
00:00:14.866 --> 00:00:15.900
It's scary

6
00:00:16.533 --> 00:00:17.466
Tell me about it.

7
00:00:17.466 --> 00:00:19.000
Don't say in Nancheng

8
00:00:19.266 --> 00:00:20.466
Even in the imperial capital

9
00:00:20.966 --> 00:00:22.600
Can enter the Emperor Fund

10
00:00:22.666 --> 00:00:24.166
That's a great honor

11
00:00:24.166 --> 00:00:26.600
It's like a golden rice bowl

12
00:00:26.666 --> 00:00:29.966
Sister-in-law, I heard that the ordinary employees here

13
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.300
50,000 dollars during the internship

14
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.666
This turn

15
00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.600
Give me a million every minute

16
00:00:36.866 --> 00:00:38.900
Yeah so you see

17
00:00:39.533 --> 00:00:41.400
There are so many competitors

18
00:00:43.333 --> 00:00:45.233
Too bad I'm pregnant

19
00:00:45.333 --> 00:00:47.400
I don't know if they will accept me.

20
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.900
Baby, this is really not the right time

21
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.966
Sister-in-law, I'm worried

22
00:00:53.966 --> 00:00:55.066
You are so good

23
00:00:55.066 --> 00:00:56.433
Education is also higher than mine

24
00:00:56.766 --> 00:00:59.000
I should be the one to worry about

25
00:01:09.866 --> 00:01:11.600
What a coincidence!

26
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:12.366
What are you doing here?

27
00:01:12.366 --> 00:01:14.100
Didn't I tell you to wait for us downstairs?

28
00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.466
I'll come over to see if you're busy with your work

29
00:01:18.166 --> 00:01:20.066
Talk like your own company

30
00:01:22.933 --> 00:01:25.400
Are the two ladies Ouyang Hongliu Yunye here?

31
00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:26.500
Uh here

32
00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:30.800
Ah you two please come with me

33
00:01:36.466 --> 00:01:37.433
What's going on here?

34
00:01:37.533 --> 00:01:38.366
What are you doing?

35
00:01:38.366 --> 00:01:39.633
Do you have to interview in advance?

36
00:01:39.733 --> 00:01:40.800
I don't know.

37
00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:42.400
I'll ask when they come back.
