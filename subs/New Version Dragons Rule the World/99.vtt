1
00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.466
Tell good and evil to be rewarded in the end

2
00:00:03.466 --> 00:00:05.500
Mrs. Chen and Mrs. Chen are locked up

3
00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:07.733
Don't worry as long as they are locked up in Nancheng

4
00:00:07.733 --> 00:00:09.566
I believe the Chen family dare not interfere

5
00:00:09.566 --> 00:00:11.200
I want to make them mother and son

6
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.366
Life in prison is worse than death

7
00:00:13.366 --> 00:00:15.233
Confession behind bars

8
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.733
The owner, this is the agreement signed by the Chen family.

9
00:00:18.733 --> 00:00:20.066
In the next two years

10
00:00:20.066 --> 00:00:21.800
Funds donated to Nancheng one after another

11
00:00:21.866 --> 00:00:24.333
That's a lot of money.

12
00:00:24.333 --> 00:00:26.900
The Chen family did not dare to go back on the quantity

13
00:00:28.733 --> 00:00:31.333
The owner is all due to the Ouyang family

14
00:00:31.333 --> 00:00:34.600
I want to establish a Ouyang City Development Fund

15
00:00:34.866 --> 00:00:37.333
To help more people

16
00:00:37.333 --> 00:00:38.633
That's exactly what I'm thinking.

17
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.366
I will donate 5 billion to Hope Primary School

18
00:00:41.366 --> 00:00:43.266
Use another 20 billion to revitalize the countryside

19
00:00:43.266 --> 00:00:46.200
I want it to happen.

20
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:47.866
Don't be slick

21
00:00:47.866 --> 00:00:48.900
Don't worry, sir.

22
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.666
I, Zhao Tiegang, have a personal guarantee.

23
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.600
Mr. You in Nancheng is a blessing to the people of Nancheng

24
00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:55.800
Retire

25
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.100
What are you two doing?

26
00:01:04.533 --> 00:01:06.733
Brother, I really didn't expect it.

27
00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:09.500
So you are the owner of the Dizun Hall

28
00:01:09.766 --> 00:01:11.966
Are you hiding quite deep?

29
00:01:11.966 --> 00:01:14.500
Yes, I knew you were doing so well

30
00:01:14.666 --> 00:01:16.900
Do you still need me to worry about supporting Ou's family?

31
00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:18.666
Do you still need me to go out to work?

32
00:01:18.733 --> 00:01:20.900
By the way, speaking of work

33
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.100
I'm more angry

34
00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:23.833
Yeah, me too.

35
00:01:23.933 --> 00:01:26.033
No wonder the geese are so kind to us.

36
00:01:26.466 --> 00:01:28.900
When we interviewed

37
00:01:28.933 --> 00:01:31.400
Are you watching our jokes from behind?

38
00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:32.700
I'm really impressed with you two

39
00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.366
Okay, I'm scared, okay?
