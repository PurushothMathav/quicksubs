00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.140
You want to rebel.

2
00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:10.700
Hello, ma'am.

3
00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:14.220
Miss, are you okay?

4
00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:16.080
Excuse me.

5
00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.780
I just saw such a big face.

6
00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:21.820
You're awake.

7
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.940
Try to be really sorry.

8
00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:27.920
Besides, this is my room.

9
00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:29.540
Who let you in?

10
00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:31.640
Hey.

11
00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:33.860
Let's see.

12
00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.180
My room.

13
00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.240
This is your room.

14
00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:43.000
No, wasn't I socializing at the Crown Hotel?

15
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.740
I remember the next half day.

16
00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:45.760
What happened?

17
00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:46.940
Why am I here?

18
00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:49.260
Where are you?

19
00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:50.480
Why do you drink so much alcohol?

20
00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.560
Yesterday if I hadn't been in time.

21
00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:54.320
You don't know where they're taking you.

22
00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.300
Ho always helped me.

23
00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:01.140
General manager, thank you.

24
00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:04.580
If I had known that court was so bad, I wouldn't have gone.

25
00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.800
Actually, I should have said I'm sorry.

26
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.800
I didn't know he was that kind of person.

27
00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:12.940
I want to know.

28
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.000
I certainly won't let you help him.

29
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.480
Don t you know he s that kind of person?

30
00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:19.820
After I fired him.

31
00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:22.380
This isn't going to happen.

32
00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.800
So now can you tell me your room is across the street?

33
00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.140
Why are you in my room?

34
00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.540
I remember being thirsty.

35
00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:37.260
Then...

36
00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:42.620
Maybe vaguely wrong, you're sure you're wrong.

37
00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.260
You came into the room deliberately.
