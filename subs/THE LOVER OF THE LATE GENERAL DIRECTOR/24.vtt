00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:04.740
Good wine. I'll toast.

2
00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:12.940
I'm a translator.

3
00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.260
Drinking too much is wrong.

4
00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:16.340
Maybe we should start talking about the project now.

5
00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:18.560
Interpreting is not important.

6
00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.440
The important thing is to make us happy.

7
00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:22.080
You see people respect you.

8
00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.220
You can't deny people their faces.

9
00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.220
There's nothing to talk about cooperation.

10
00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.060
Why do you blame me?

11
00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.160
Why are you calling?

12
00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.120
Have a drink with me.

13
00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.660
I can't drink anymore.

14
00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:50.200
What does Secretary Lam mean?

15
00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:51.460
My husband gave me a nose.

16
00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:59.120
Dear, you came home so early today.

17
00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:00.580
I suddenly miss you.

18
00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:05.180
Who?

19
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.380
You also said why you hung up when you got off the phone.

20
00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:11.900
No one answered.

21
00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.580
Honey, where are you going tonight?

22
00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:19.260
I'm going to take care of something.

23
00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:20.360
Rest early

24
00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.940
This is more than midnight blood to directly call what?

25
00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:28.540
Let's just say there's no mind to him.
