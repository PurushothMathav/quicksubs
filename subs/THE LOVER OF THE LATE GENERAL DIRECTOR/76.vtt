00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:05.700
You mean you saved me in a car accident?

2
00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:10.660
It's me, so the last few days you asked for leave were because of a car accident.

3
00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:14.420
Yes, I'm afraid you're worried so I'm not kidding.

4
00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:17.740
Why did you say he saved me?

5
00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:18.700
What's going on?

6
00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:20.200
I called an ambulance.

7
00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:24.140
Well, last time I was in a coma after pushing the old lady out.

8
00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:25.860
I woke up in the hospital.

9
00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.540
This is the ambulance that he called to take us to the hospital.

10
00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:32.860
So Secretary Ninh was also my life-saving benefactor.

11
00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.380
Min Min, if you know that Secretary Ninh saved her, even told her to take her to the hospital.

12
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.260
So why then do you say that the secretary invites people for a date?

13
00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.740
It's because my daughter's not feeling well.

14
00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:47.180
Why do you think?

15
00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.020
Talk to Me

16
00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.200
She was worried that her grandmother couldn't sleep.

17
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:55.920
I'm afraid you're more worried.

18
00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.100
So it's a blatant lie.

19
00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:01.300
That's what it looks like.

20
00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.840
It's also a blatant lie.

21
00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.260
Oh, don't make him so bad.

22
00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.020
So why didn't you speak up for so long?

23
00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.020
Didn't I forget?

24
00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.500
I don't lose money on mathematics.

25
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.720
He seems to have misunderstood too.

26
00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.100
You don't just have a problem.

27
00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:25.340
Choose the Mustang.

28
00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:27.360
You're welcome.

29
00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.460
This wedding dress.

30
00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:32.640
Oh, you saved my sister, let alone a wedding dress.

31
00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.220
It's just 100, ha ha.
