00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:05.020
Ma'am, I didn't mean to.

2
00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:07.780
That's what the wedding dress store sent me.

3
00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:10.140
If you don't believe it, you can check the surveillance.

4
00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:12.260
No more tests.

5
00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:13.360
For whatever reason.

6
00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:16.360
This is because you're not doing a good job.

7
00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:17.380
You're right.

8
00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:19.120
This is my problem.

9
00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:21.080
I am willing to compensate for this wedding dress.

10
00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:23.200
This wedding dress is made by hand.

11
00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.160
It's just that there are tens of millions temporarily up there.

12
00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:26.560
Can you pay for it?

13
00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:27.660
I can't.

14
00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:29.540
But because that's my problem.

15
00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:31.300
I won't shirk responsibility.

16
00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.540
No matter how much I want

17
00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:35.420
That's a good temperament.

18
00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:37.660
How to do some embarrassing things?

19
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.880
Ma'am, what do you mean?

20
00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:41.360
I don't go around with you anymore.

21
00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.520
You don't need to compensate for this wedding dress.

22
00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.660
You quit your job and leave the story.

23
00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:51.000
Why is it possible that because of something, you are not ashamed to interfere with the feelings between Miss Linh Linh and Gu General?

24
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.320
Our old lady has a good heart.

25
00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.560
Don't want to argue with you

26
00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:55.520
Go ahead and get out of the company.

27
00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:56.960
Don't piss off the CEO. Try to be there.

28
00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.660
I said, why did the guy who named me give me a wedding dress?

29
00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:00.720
It turns out that's the reason.

30
00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:02.760
If you know why.

31
00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.120
Then go back and quit your job.

32
00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:06.380
I don't want to trouble you too much.

33
00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.500
Excuse me, ma'am.

34
00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:09.860
But I can't die.

35
00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.620
Secretary Kim, I see you're drinking and not eating fine wine.
