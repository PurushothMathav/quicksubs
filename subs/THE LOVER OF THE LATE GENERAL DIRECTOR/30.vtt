00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:03.340
All right, Chief.

2
00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.180
Total spend 230,008 thousand

3
00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:11.900
No need to pack and deliver.

4
00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.860
230,000 dollars, how long can I pay?

5
00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:20.420
Whisper what?

6
00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:23.100
Didn't you inherit my father yesterday?

7
00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:24.940
They want me to bleed.

8
00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.060
Director General, I swear.

9
00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:31.040
I really didn't mean to come into your room last night.

10
00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:34.300
If I try, I'll die.

11
00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.020
What are you talking about?

12
00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.060
If you are angry, you should do it.

13
00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:43.080
But you can't punish me like that.

14
00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:44.020
What punishment?

15
00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.840
I was really drunk last night.

16
00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.680
I promise there won't be a next time.

17
00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.240
Please forgive me.

18
00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:52.900
You wouldn't think

19
00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.760
This 230,000 clothing is deducted from your salary.

20
00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.940
Right? I still can't see your small amount.

21
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.800
You're my secretary.

22
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.460
That's my facade.

23
00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.740
These dresses.

24
00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:07.600
That's what it turns out.

25
00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:08.840
So thank you, General Manager.

26
00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.400
I promise I'll dress up when I go out.

27
00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.780
Absolutely not to shame you.

28
00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.040
It's true that people rely on clothes, horses rely on saddles.

29
00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:21.880
Dress like that

30
00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:23.340
The turn rate is much higher.

31
00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:26.780
Snow Week

32
00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:28.460
Dad.
