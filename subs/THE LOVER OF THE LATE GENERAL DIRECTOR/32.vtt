00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:03.640
No matter who you marry.

2
00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:06.360
There is no bride price of 200,000, I disagree.

3
00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:07.920
My bride doesn't cost a penny.

4
00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:09.580
I don't need your consent either.

5
00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:11.720
You.

6
00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:14.300
This is not filial.

7
00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:16.380
I'm not done with you.

8
00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.900
The snow is married.

9
00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:21.820
Claiming to be single.

10
00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:26.560
You hear that?

11
00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.180
That freshman Lili is married.

12
00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:32.260
I heard that the whole company is spreading everywhere.

13
00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:37.520
I can't believe people look so honest, get married and pretend to be single.

14
00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:39.760
How does he want green?

15
00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:41.900
Pretend to fly up a tree branch and turn into a phoenix

16
00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:43.900
What are you talking about?

17
00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.360
I say some people are not ashamed.

18
00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.860
Foot pedaling two boats pretending to be pure

19
00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:50.340
I'm single.

20
00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:52.600
Still lying.

21
00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.780
You wouldn't follow me, lie and say nothing.

22
00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.060
Hey, guys.

23
00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:06.140
Forget it, I don't know if my father can kill me again.

24
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.060
No regrets, no regrets.

25
00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.100
Financial withdrawal.

26
00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:25.420
Something to talk about.

27
00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.060
The late General Director, you know that Secretary Ninh is married.

28
00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:32.520
What?

29
00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.180
The company is all transmitting news, I heard that Secretary Ninh herself said.
