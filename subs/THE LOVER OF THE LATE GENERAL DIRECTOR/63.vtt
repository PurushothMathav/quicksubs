00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:03.340
Wake up.

2
00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:17.820
But you also dare to move.

3
00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:28.640
General Director Wu

4
00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:39.140
The rest is for you to handle.

5
00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:40.980
Give me a lesson.

6
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:42.420
Yes.

7
00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:50.680
There's no answer.

8
00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:51.660
Remember the taboo.

9
00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:52.860
Do not eat spicy

10
00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:53.900
Don't touch the water.

11
00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:55.660
Thank you, doctor.

12
00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.220
Did the doctor leave a scar?

13
00:00:58.600 --> 00:00:59.440
The wound is not deep.

14
00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:01.800
Wait for the scale, just follow the time difference.

15
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:02.880
Thank you, doctor.

16
00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:03.900
Thank you, doctor.

17
00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:11.420
You're scared now.

18
00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.140
Why don't you think so much when you're alone?

19
00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.380
Didn't they tell me I only brought money?

20
00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:19.320
As a result, there's not enough money.

21
00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.560
You don't carry enough either.

22
00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.100
Do you know what would have happened if I hadn't been there?

23
00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.020
Excuse me.

24
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.780
It's bothering you again.

25
00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:35.740
Later, later when you go out remember to follow me.

26
00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.340
Remember to tell your friends.
