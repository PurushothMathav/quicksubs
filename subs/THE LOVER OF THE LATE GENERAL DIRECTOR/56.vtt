1
00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:03.600
You're old.

2
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.380
If there's a little bit of stitching

3
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.340
It was a loss for him.

4
00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:13.220
Well, it's not too early.

5
00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:15.020
Go back and rest.

6
00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:17.020
It's okay if I go back.

7
00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:18.980
I'll take care of the old lady.

8
00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.760
You've been working a lot of overtime lately.

9
00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.100
You go back first.

10
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.260
It's okay, I live here every day.

11
00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:27.340
Your health is weak.

12
00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:29.100
Go home.

13
00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.660
This bed is narrow and hard.

14
00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:36.060
Director General, what are your sleeping habits?

15
00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:46.420
Remember

16
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.480
Grandpa, I almost fell.

17
00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:53.880
Try to help me.

18
00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:57.500
It was an accident, don't get me wrong.

19
00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:01.720
The first snow I negotiated with Since Nien.

20
00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:03.860
When my grandmother wakes up, we're going to have a wedding.

21
00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:08.260
She will probably wake up soon.

22
00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.420
Should our wedding begin to prepare?
