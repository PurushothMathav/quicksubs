00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:08.320
He's just injured.

2
00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:10.260
The doctor said he'll wake up soon.

3
00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:16.020
Forget it, as long as this accident doesn't have time to drink the last point.

4
00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:17.560
I thought you saved the old lady.

5
00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.980
The whole world is afraid of not being able to leave you.

6
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:21.800
Well done this time.

7
00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.220
Memory Drive Recorder

8
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:24.800
Don't worry.

9
00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.360
Snow, you're awake.

10
00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:36.980
Do you remember anything?

11
00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:38.760
Right.

12
00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:41.660
Right.

13
00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:44.460
I remember a car accident.

14
00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:46.740
Yeon-yeon, how's my old lady?

15
00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.800
Don't worry, the old lady has been rescued.

16
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.860
It's just that we're not out of danger yet.

17
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:53.680
I'm going to see him.

18
00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:55.320
Don't move, ma'am.

19
00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.480
Now the ICU is temporarily inconvenient to bother you.

20
00:00:58.480 --> 00:00:59.980
Take care of your health first.

21
00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.820
I'm okay, I just have a headache.

22
00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:04.300
Oh, that's right, Yeon-yeon.

23
00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:06.620
Who took me and my wife to the hospital?

24
00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.340
Of course I am, if I hadn't brought your old lady here in time, I wouldn't have thought.

25
00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.340
Yeon-yeon, thank you for saving me and my wife.

26
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.260
What's so polite between you and me?

27
00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:21.260
Hey, do you remember who stabbed you?

28
00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.280
I can't remember if it's okay.

29
00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.400
The campaigner was sent to the police station.

30
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.200
Okay, science. You're awake.

31
00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.500
What's wrong? Is there anything else in your body that's uncomfortable?
