00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:08.700
The phone suddenly died.

2
00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:10.800
Okay, that's it.

3
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.760
Also, these things, these things, they're all inclusive.

4
00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:18.060
Swipe the card, go ahead.

5
00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.980
It's like spending money on land.

6
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.100
I invited you today.

7
00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:27.840
Come to the human resources department tomorrow to receive the award.

8
00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.820
How much can the bonus be?

9
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.900
Don't you need me to drive anymore?

10
00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:36.660
I have work to do today.

11
00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.380
Just drive yourself.

12
00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.540
It's all for me.

13
00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:46.060
You like it?

14
00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.780
Remember how expensive this diamond ring was?

15
00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.300
You're the one I've wanted to marry since I was a kid.

16
00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:00.700
Not money for much.

17
00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.100
As long as you can cook raw rice.

18
00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:06.480
Even when the cat's lies are exposed

19
00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:08.680
Why worry about losing all of this?

20
00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:09.580
Remember

21
00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:11.820
I think.

22
00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.780
Why do I conflict with the closeness of Ninh Ninh so much?

23
00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.500
You friend friend friend

24
00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:23.580
Take a break.

25
00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.660
Early childhood

26
00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.540
Heavy traffic

27
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.140
Your friend's gone.

28
00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.760
Well, when did you meet?

29
00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.320
Why don't you introduce me?

30
00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:20.060
Well, wait until we get to know each other before we introduce you to each other.

31
00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.180
Go out for a drink.

32
00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.420
By the way, Yeon-yeon, I'm telling you, today

33
00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:32.340
What is this?

34
00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.860
Isn't this the diamond ring that our boss chose for his fianc√©e?
