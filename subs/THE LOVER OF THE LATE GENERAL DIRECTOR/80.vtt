00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:03.520
General Director

2
00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:05.700
Yeon-yeon and I are best friends.

3
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.600
Come and tease me before your relationship is done.

4
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:10.380
He got me into nuclear power.

5
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.380
You find out I'll handle this relationship well.

6
00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:23.700
That he saved me as a kid.

7
00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.980
I rely on a return.

8
00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.280
What about Yeon Yeon s feelings for you?

9
00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:29.780
What about what he did to you?

10
00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:34.060
Did you know that he is now happily preparing for your 16th wedding every day?

11
00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:37.280
General Director

12
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.260
First, find out who is in your heart.

13
00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.820
Talk to you after you arrange the processing.

14
00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:45.960
Secretary

15
00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.420
I can't believe it.

16
00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.860
Our late General Director also had a day trapped by love.

17
00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.360
Talk to me.

18
00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:06.500
Do you like your big secretary or do you like the benefactor who saved your childhood life?

19
00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.180
Before meeting the enemy, where did I go in my dreams every day?

20
00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.580
So now the company in your heart should be

21
00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.100
Executive secretary full, right?

22
00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.760
Don't worry, it's just the clerk.

23
00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:21.060
I'm not confused.

24
00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:25.500
Just thinking.

25
00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.100
If I talk to you next year about giving up kissing,

26
00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:31.300
It's unacceptable.

27
00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:34.220
Like that.

28
00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:36.820
So, man, I get it.

29
00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.100
We can only find out for ourselves.

30
00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:47.500
You're serious.

31
00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.700
I haven't been to work in a week of snow.

32
00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.100
Okay, I know.

33
00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.180
Looks like he really resigned.

34
00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:00.060
Let's get started.

35
00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:06.260
Why did you cancel your wedding to Ninh Ninh?

36
00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.400
Granny, don't get excited.

37
00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:10.240
Can I not be excited?

38
00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:13.380
Grandson, why did you cancel the wedding?

39
00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.700
Hey, do you really like that secretary?
