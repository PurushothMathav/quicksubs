00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:05.700
OK, the computer is restored.

2
00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:10.420
Really.

3
00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:11.740
All the documents.

4
00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:13.020
Date saved

5
00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:14.500
It's all here.

6
00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:17.300
Now I have proof that I'm innocent.

7
00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:22.020
Now let's see how cunning Fang Ming is about stealing my documents.

8
00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:25.260
All right, Mr. Shaw.

9
00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:26.220
Thank you.

10
00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:29.320
I used to find a lot of computer repair masters who couldn't fix it.

11
00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:30.960
I can't believe your technique is so amazing.

12
00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.080
It's fixed.

13
00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:33.760
Hi, pediatrician.

14
00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.260
Hey, but you really should thank me. It's probably from the Year of the Child.

15
00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.120
He gave me a lot of things to ask for my help.

16
00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.100
Later, eat more walnuts.

17
00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:44.540
Brain Supplements

18
00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.620
Thank you, General Manager.

19
00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.600
So now I'm going to buy you some walnut drinks.

20
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:50.820
This is no longer needed.

21
00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.740
Let's transfer the honey later.

22
00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.840
Hey, this is the first time I've seen you draw that big.

23
00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.380
Because a woman came to get me help.

24
00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.400
Unexpected.

25
00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.820
Is this still a friend I know?

26
00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.340
All right, all right, all right.

27
00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:11.700
Take down the bridge across the river, right?

28
00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:13.000
Forget it.

29
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.100
It's the wedding day, now please charge me. Let's go.

30
00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:22.440
General Director

31
00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.100
Come on, you're looking for me.

32
00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:29.360
No.

33
00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:33.140
I'll ask you one last time.

34
00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.220
This document is yours.

35
00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:41.200
Don't believe Destiny High School's lies, these plans were actually made by me.

36
00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.440
Smart, you're dead.

37
00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:45.260
My computer has been repaired.

38
00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:47.700
You stole my translation.

39
00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.620
The date of preservation of all Yuan Van knives is evidence.
