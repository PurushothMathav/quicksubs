00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:06.380
I don't remember.

2
00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.380
Mom, I got you to the hospital in time.

3
00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:16.960
Good boy, I know you're the lucky star of our family.

4
00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:20.660
Fortunately, her grandmother couldn't remember being pushed to the rescue by her bleeding.

5
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:24.060
Don't tell me who saved him.

6
00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:28.620
The late general manager, I packed up first and am ready to go home.

7
00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.980
I gave it to you.

8
00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.060
My grandmother just woke up.

9
00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.300
Sorry, I have a friend to pick me up.

10
00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:37.060
You two talk first.

11
00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:46.380
Won't my nephew do anything wrong with you?

12
00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.880
Hey, Sister Snow, won't you leave the hospital tomorrow?

13
00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:53.200
Why are you back today?

14
00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.860
Didn't call me to pick you up.

15
00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:57.900
I'm completely fine, how can I answer?

16
00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:00.620
It's so clean.

17
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.940
Homework, brother, this is my house cleaning.

18
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:08.000
Yes, I have nothing to do today, so I cleaned the house a little.

19
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.500
Are you hungry?

20
00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.620
No, I'm done eating.

21
00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.260
Brother homework, xin chÃ o save.

22
00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:16.500
Because I'm very economical.

23
00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.420
Do you want to consider marrying me?

24
00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:20.800
Stop kidding.

25
00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.260
The pure friendship between us

26
00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:23.420
It's impossible.

27
00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:26.920
Oh right, you saved my grandmother anyway.

28
00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.820
This is not a money saver, and I didn't come to give it to you.
