1
00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:05.100
He's generous.

2
00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:06.940
Generosity takes 300 million.

3
00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:09.900
The first snow, you must remember.

4
00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.420
Whether he tries or not.

5
00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:13.140
He's a famous fiancÃ©.

6
00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:15.620
Nothing can be with you.

7
00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:17.820
Of course.

8
00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:19.420
My boss.

9
00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:21.440
He's an autocrat.

10
00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:22.960
He knows every day to put me on overtime.

11
00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:24.560
He's a ruthless capitalist.

12
00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:26.040
Every day is like a peeling week.

13
00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.220
How can I be

14
00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.100
Take me home.

15
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.140
But isn't the wind here?

16
00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.880
The wind.

17
00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.100
You have a job.

18
00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:53.100
Right? Yeah, I got a job.

19
00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:56.900
Mine, my mother, he's blind dating.

20
00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:59.060
Not my mother.

21
00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:00.780
Dating in May.

22
00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:02.820
It's 12 o'clock.

23
00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:04.500
You're still dating.

24
00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:07.620
Like us.

25
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.380
The social elite

26
00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:12.060
No matter what time someone is waiting.

27
00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:13.560
Let's go.

28
00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.720
Don t you want to go with the old lady?

29
00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:18.860
Well, I have an escort.

30
00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.380
Oh, I don't have the general manager's day-to-day machine.

31
00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.080
Stay up late every day

32
00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.620
This body he can't stand.

33
00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:29.260
I told you.

34
00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.680
You work too hard.

35
00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:31.960
The body certainly can't stand it.

36
00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:33.540
Ask the caregiver to relax.

37
00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:44.040
Hey.

38
00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:45.440
Hey.

39
00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:49.680
Hey, man, why didn't you get back in time?

40
00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.220
First snow, first snow goes out.

41
00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.260
Didn't General Director Du Yeon-yeon come back with you?

42
00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:57.900
He wants to go back on his own.

43
00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:05.300
Seatbelts must be tightened.
