00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:05.300
General Director Gu has helped me so many times without demanding return.

2
00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:08.340
How can I use this kindness to ask him to find the sender?

3
00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:10.360
Mathematics

4
00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:12.140
You should say

5
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.080
She's awake.

6
00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.660
They're getting married on the 16th of next month.

7
00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:20.100
You want me to be a father.

8
00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.340
He invited you too.

9
00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.740
Yeah, but don't say no to me.

10
00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:28.380
I'm a little tired.

11
00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:29.760
Go home and rest.

12
00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.740
Close the door when you leave.

13
00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:37.820
Do you remember the snow?

14
00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.340
It's really heartwarming.

15
00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.700
Granny, be careful.

16
00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.480
Actually, I'm fine.

17
00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:47.600
Just been admitted to the hospital.

18
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.140
Don't be so careful.

19
00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.200
The ground is slippery, or be careful to hold it.

20
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:52.640
Oh, boy.

21
00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.380
Find some furniture for your grandmother's heart and put it down.

22
00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.800
Grandmother, I've discussed resignation.

23
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.120
I want to wait for you to invite me to help you decide.

24
00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:02.360
That's right.

25
00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.180
The next 16 months were a good day.

26
00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.600
We are ready to get married in time tomorrow.

27
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.280
Haha.

28
00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:11.180
Come on.

29
00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.240
Fast what?

30
00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.800
Haven't you been looking for Ninh Ninh for 20 years?

31
00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.700
Don t you want to find Ninh Ninh earlier to enter the door?
