00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:03.520
Right.

2
00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:06.540
Why is the hair so hot?

3
00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:09.180
Excuse me, Director General.

4
00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:11.860
Ten years, what are you doing?

5
00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:13.900
Sir.

6
00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:15.580
Me, don't get me wrong.

7
00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.600
I almost fell.

8
00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:18.600
Try to help me a little.

9
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:19.820
Right.

10
00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:22.920
Don't be afraid.

11
00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.180
I'm just kidding.

12
00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:27.520
Of course I believe you.

13
00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:29.800
You two are my closest people.

14
00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.360
Even if everyone in this world betrays me

15
00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:34.260
Both of you.

16
00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:35.140
Right?

17
00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:39.260
Yes, it's my fiancÃ©.

18
00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.580
Why won't you do anything?

19
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.940
Uh, I've got a job, Secretary Ninh.

20
00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:48.180
Arrange for you a job later.

21
00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:50.280
Yes.

22
00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:51.560
Afternoon tea

23
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:52.800
Okay.

24
00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.540
Classmate, I'm leaving.

25
00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:03.640
The British secretary.

26
00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.840
There's an urgent job here.

27
00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:07.020
You translate it.

28
00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:08.340
Bonus is doubled

29
00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.820
Master, I'll finish it quickly.

30
00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.920
Ma'am, aren't you bleeding very well?

31
00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:19.640
I'm asking you to find a way to destroy his project.

32
00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.000
It's best to defeat him.

33
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.840
I want him to break the cloud.

34
00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.060
Get out of the story, don't worry.

35
00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.780
It's finally translated.

36
00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:38.580
Off work

37
00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:08.900
What situation?

38
00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:10.960
I finally came to work.

39
00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:13.240
Didn't you translate for that project yesterday?

40
00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.740
It is convenient to carefully complete the translation and send it to the supervisor Hoang.

41
00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.740
Director Huang put this project in his charge.

42
00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.240
It took half a day.

43
00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:21.620
Also send translated documents for everyone to see in the group.

44
00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.620
Isn't this what I translated?

45
00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.220
How to make the composition clear?
