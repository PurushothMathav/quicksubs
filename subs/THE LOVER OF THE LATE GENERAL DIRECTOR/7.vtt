00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:03.360
You read it wrong.

2
00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:05.900
Why is your boss's diamond ring here?

3
00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:08.840
Also, what if you're the boss?

4
00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:11.060
Then I'll hug your thigh directly.

5
00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:15.840
Your boss, it was a good day for you to come in.

6
00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.840
Yeah, I almost quit my job.

7
00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.720
But luckily, I'm very professional.

8
00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.220
Directly become secretary of the late General.

9
00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.000
By the way, my boss gave me an overtime bonus today.

10
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.080
Your delivery is also high.

11
00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.000
The three of us went out together.

12
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.980
Yeah, next time.

13
00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.420
Um, tell me, is your boss handsome and rich?

14
00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:43.920
He is handsome, and most importantly, he is good to our future boss.

15
00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.340
Tens of millions of diamond rings don't blink when paying cards.

16
00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:53.420
The lady of our future director-general is so happy to treat her lover with such sincerity.

17
00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:58.660
Do you like a man like your boss?

18
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.380
Laughing at what?

19
00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.620
Your best friend, who am I, don't you even know?

20
00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.900
This is not to be afraid that the person you like shouldn't like will get hurt.

21
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:13.200
Since the last time I was picked up by my younger brother, I've locked my heart.

22
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.180
I only have work in my heart.

23
00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:17.580
Ten o'clock tomorrow.

24
00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:19.500
Business Hotel Talk Cooperation

25
00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:20.980
Dress up a little.

26
00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.020
Yes, boss.

27
00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.140
General Manager Gu is here.

28
00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:28.980
This is Alex.

29
00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.180
Hello, this is Jason.

30
00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:35.320
Hi.

31
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.300
General Manager Gu heard he bought the True Love necklace for $150 million at auction.

32
00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:44.640
The noble woman below is Mrs. Gu.

33
00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:45.660
You got it wrong.

34
00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.120
I'm General Manager Gu's secretary.

35
00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:48.340
I'm calling you out.

36
00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.880
Help you.

37
00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.940
Remember when to bring your age to see me.

38
00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.560
I'll call Mr. Zhao to stay.

39
00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:05.740
Go see him for me.

40
00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:07.980
Unexpected.

41
00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:11.540
There is also such a first-class beauty.

42
00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.540
Your secretary has such a beautiful body.

43
00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.200
Normally not less moisturized.

44
00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.740
What are you doing? I'm General Manager Gu's secretary.

45
00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:22.580
A small secretary.

46
00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.140
I think you can compare that to hundreds of millions of projects.

47
00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.260
Try hard if you know.

48
00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.220
I like you, I shouldn't have put you in my bed.

49
00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.380
You can move my people too.
