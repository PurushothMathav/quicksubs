00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.800
Ninh Ninh

2
00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:17.340
If you really don't want to drive

3
00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.540
You don't have to take revenge on me like that.

4
00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:21.540
Why are you touching your nose?

5
00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:24.740
Is there a law that says no one can touch their nose?

6
00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:30.140
No.

7
00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:32.740
What's wrong with me?

8
00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.940
Why do you always feel your secretary is not nutritive?

9
00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:41.740
Get out of the car.

10
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.160
Where's the director general?

11
00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.420
This is the old house story.

12
00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.300
Today my fiancee wants to see my grandmother.

13
00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:57.200
General Director

14
00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:00.260
I like people who come to see their parents.

15
00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:02.420
Isn't it inappropriate for me to be here?

16
00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:10.660
You're my secretary.

17
00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:14.920
The gift I brought you, do you want me to take it for you?

18
00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.120
Well, of course it doesn't bother you.

19
00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:18.020
I can do it.

20
00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:19.340
Hey, I can do this.

21
00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:21.860
Go ahead, tell me.

22
00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:25.540
A rich, colorful and personable person like you

23
00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.300
So how good is it to get your fiancÃ©?

24
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.260
In my eyes

25
00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.740
He's more than excellent.

26
00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.700
So how did you two meet?

27
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.260
Twenty years ago.

28
00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.660
He saved me, not the hero.

29
00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:45.900
Why is there a girl?

30
00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:47.820
Then your feelings must be very deep.

31
00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.840
Do you want to be charming from childhood?

32
00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:51.540
We're not boyfriends.

33
00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:53.360
We're actually dear friends.

34
00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.820
Keep you waiting, this girl Yeon-yeon.
