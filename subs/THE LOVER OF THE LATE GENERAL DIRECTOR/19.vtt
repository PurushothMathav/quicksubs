00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:10.720
What is our relationship?

2
00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:12.500
Say what you can't say.

3
00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:15.420
Aren't you Xu Ninh's born secretary?

4
00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.780
We go out with him every day.

5
00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.260
Listen to some people who are not good to you.

6
00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:23.540
Sir, General Gu and I are only a superior-subordinate relationship.

7
00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:25.980
But the first snow was scary.

8
00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.660
You should resign.

9
00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.780
The rumors are not true.

10
00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:31.160
I don't mind.

11
00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:32.500
But I mind.

12
00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.880
Grandpa, I love this job.

13
00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.220
I'm not resigning.

14
00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:44.920
Sun Wukong also came.

15
00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:46.340
So I'll go out first.

16
00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.180
The lady doesn't like this girl.

17
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:52.800
Right.

18
00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:54.060
Ma'am.

19
00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.420
Your name is Phuong Minh.

20
00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:04.880
What does this woman mean?

21
00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:06.160
Who do you think you are?

22
00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:07.980
I see she has the richest boyfriend.

23
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.700
The whole person has changed.

24
00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.500
He probably doesn't feel safe, doesn't have bad thoughts.

25
00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:17.860
Didn't I say I was okay?

26
00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:19.840
You didn't get here early, did you?

27
00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:21.640
You lie still.

28
00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.000
There is no one in my store today.

29
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.260
I'll call.

30
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.100
Drink the soup first.

31
00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.260
Thank you, Song.

32
00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:39.380
The lady is back.

33
00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:41.740
You're very good.

34
00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.260
May the lady be born in death.

35
00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.800
You're going back to work the next day, right?

36
00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:48.600
Yes.

37
00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:55.580
OK, the day after tomorrow I will go to the company and tell everyone that I am Xu Nien's fianc√©.
