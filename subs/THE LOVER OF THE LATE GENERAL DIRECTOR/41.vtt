1
00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:03.660
Come on, take you home.

2
00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:05.400
Go.

3
00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:07.740
What are you doing?

4
00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:10.160
Dad.

5
00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:13.140
Why are you here?

6
00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.960
Read the snow first.

7
00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.340
You're not married. You said you were.

8
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.340
Who says I'm not married?

9
00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.560
My best friend.

10
00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.760
Now you go meet my blind date.

11
00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:25.860
The location has been set.

12
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.820
I'm married, uncle.

13
00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:30.840
It's not fair to bleed.

14
00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:31.860
You open it for me.

15
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.100
Dare to lie to me

16
00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:37.520
What you're saying is true.

17
00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:38.340
Look at that.

18
00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:40.300
I'm married.

19
00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:44.940
Fortunately, it was faked before.

20
00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.940
The marriage certificate is all here, how can it be fake?

21
00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.080
The late director will have another meal later.

22
00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:54.980
Do you want to take a look at the rest house or...

23
00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:04.500
Let's go eat.

24
00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:05.840
Drink.

25
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.160
Uncle, me and the beginner have received the certificate.

26
00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:17.080
Not enough time to inform family and friends.

27
00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.460
He said he wanted to wait for us to rest before visiting you.

28
00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.340
They're married now.

29
00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.700
The bride price is no longer 200,000.

30
00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:30.220
Don't want to marry my daughter.

31
00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:37.100
Hey, General Manager Gu, isn't that your secretary?

32
00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.180
Is something wrong?
