00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:04.680
New, I'm fine.

2
00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.880
Don t worry, you can go first, so I ll go first.

3
00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.100
Goodbye.

4
00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:14.660
Try hard, if not.

5
00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:16.780
We went to the hospital for a check-up.

6
00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:21.720
What is it that doesn't need this for me?

7
00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.260
How is that possible?

8
00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:28.380
If not, I'll buy you some medicine first.

9
00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:31.060
Wow.

10
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.480
I'm a little sleepy now.

11
00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.160
Secretary Ninh will take me home.

12
00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.260
All right, let's go.

13
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.820
Don t you really need to go check it out?

14
00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:50.500
You can work now.

15
00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.620
No more.

16
00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.500
What's wrong? Your house is here.

17
00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.300
It's late, I also have to go home and rest. I won't go. I'll see you tomorrow.

18
00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:11.380
See you tomorrow.

19
00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:25.000
Drive so fast.

20
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.920
Are you afraid of coming home late?

21
00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.500
Afraid that man is angry.

22
00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.340
Why are you so late for work today? I'm tired.

23
00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.100
First snow, you coax my sister

24
00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:51.040
Oh, I'm so tired, I finally got off work today.

25
00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:52.560
It's hard, eat a little more today.

26
00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.300
Yeah, that's right, first snow.

27
00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.200
Your colleagues will not make it difficult for you later.

28
00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:58.260
Of course not.

29
00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.940
I warned him if I ever had a job.

30
00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:02.580
The first person to be examined was him.

31
00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:03.400
You don't know.

32
00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:04.840
If it wasn't for the lake today,

33
00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.660
I don't know what's going to happen.

34
00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.780
Classmate, why have you been telling me about this boss lately?
