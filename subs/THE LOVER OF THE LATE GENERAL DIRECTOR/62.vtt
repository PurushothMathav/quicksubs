00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:06.980
I can't believe your sincerity is enough this time.

2
00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.060
I tried to make it happen.

3
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:10.620
This gentleman.

4
00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:13.060
You're obviously fooling my brother.

5
00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:15.120
200,000 becomes 2 million.

6
00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.620
It's illegal for you to do that.

7
00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:20.820
In violation of the law, did I force your brother to borrow my money?

8
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:21.940
Right.

9
00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.540
I just need to see the money today.

10
00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:26.100
I didn't say no.

11
00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:27.940
200,000 will be returned.

12
00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.240
Two million is impossible.

13
00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.780
Okay, no.

14
00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:34.940
Let him leave a hand.

15
00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.820
Don't save me!

16
00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:39.740
I don't have that much money now.

17
00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:41.100
I'll give you the money.

18
00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:45.880
Let me go, I'll give you the money back.

19
00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:47.280
Cary now has 1.2 million.

20
00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.340
I'm leaving right now.

21
00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.260
Okay, but...

22
00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.000
I'm afraid you run and you won't come back.

23
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.500
Need a little more interest

24
00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:56.800
What do you mean?

25
00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.420
I've got to leave a note on your face.

26
00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:01.920
I may not accept it.

27
00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.580
No, you can't.
