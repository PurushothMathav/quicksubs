00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:10.340
Didn't you say your grandmother woke up?

2
00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:12.180
Just woke up.

3
00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:13.980
The patient just woke up.

4
00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:16.340
You should be awake by now.

5
00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:19.600
When will the doctor wake up?

6
00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.160
It depends on the patient himself.

7
00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:23.300
It's okay now anyway.

8
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.580
He'll wake up later. Don't fight too much.

9
00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:27.980
The doctor is assured.

10
00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:32.300
If you want to wake up so fast.

11
00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:35.500
Damn, if he sees someone being saved, you bleed.

12
00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.260
And what if I hit him in that car?

13
00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.220
How good it would be if I never woke up.

14
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:43.080
It's this late.

15
00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:45.200
Ten years, you and Snow Sister go back first.

16
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.500
I still look at men.

17
00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.400
No, you two go home.

18
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.060
General manager, you haven't rested well lately.

19
00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:53.240
I'm completely fine.

20
00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:54.620
I'll take care of the old lady.

21
00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:55.980
How is this possible?

22
00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:03.780
I love you.

23
00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.440
You don't have to stay and take care of me.

24
00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:09.240
Granny.

25
00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:10.780
How do you feel?

26
00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:15.220
It's okay, I just fell asleep.

27
00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:17.640
Granny.

28
00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.020
Do you remember?

29
00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:22.380
What happened on the day of the accident.
