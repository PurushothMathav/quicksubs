00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:06.060
The lady is here.

2
00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:07.600
Hi, ma'am.

3
00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:08.800
Don't be afraid.

4
00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.840
I'm still the fiancé of the family.

5
00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:11.920
Family rules

6
00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:13.720
You can call me Ninh Tien.

7
00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:14.940
Hello, Miss Ninh.

8
00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:16.320
You go back to work first.

9
00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:17.760
Don't stress.

10
00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.720
I've got people placing snacks outside the building.

11
00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:20.980
People don't need gas.

12
00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:23.680
Miss Ninh is beautiful and generous.

13
00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:25.620
For us, the sum total is really born as a couple.

14
00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:26.840
Yeah, yeah.

15
00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:28.140
Thank you, Miss Ninh.

16
00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:31.540
General Gu is still in a meeting, wait for your guests, wait.

17
00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:36.080
It's not too late.

18
00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:38.240
It turns out that Gu's fiancee is Miss Ling.

19
00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:41.040
We used to think that the Bleeding Order and the Total

20
00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.200
Don't talk nonsense.

21
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.000
You all know Gu's lover, right?

22
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.480
This is Miss Ninh.

23
00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.380
That's the character that Gu held in the palm of his hand.

24
00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:49.440
Try total goodness

25
00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.380
It's not that some people with ulterior motives can hold on.

26
00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.020
Are you talking about me?

27
00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:55.840
Some people know.

28
00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:57.260
Try not to look back at him.

29
00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.960
Our general manager Gu's fiancee is both beautiful and generous.

30
00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:07.660
Unlike some people who think that being hugged a little by Gu is able to fly up a tree branch and turn into a phoenix.

31
00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:09.560
You've misunderstood.

32
00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.920
General Manager Gu's fiancee and I are good friends.

33
00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.100
It's always because my fiancé's face takes more care of me.

34
00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:18.260
Secretary General Lam

35
00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:21.060
Give me the office.

36
00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.780
Do you know what you're bleeding for?

37
00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:26.880
Miss Ninh.

38
00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.140
The president and his fiancee.

39
00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.580
I must have heard of that whole bleeding charm.

40
00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:32.700
It's still here.

41
00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:33.720
Absolutely.

42
00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.540
I want to get the blood out.
