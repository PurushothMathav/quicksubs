00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:05.740
No more talking.

2
00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:10.620
The company can't accommodate the kind of chicken thief you are.

3
00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:12.780
Have your own book.

4
00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:14.360
General Director

5
00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.960
You can't fire me.

6
00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:16.540
I'm the old man of the company.

7
00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:18.520
Director General, give me one more chance.

8
00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:19.980
That's not good.

9
00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:24.640
General Director

10
00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:28.860
What is this?

11
00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:30.700
This is a thank you gift.

12
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:35.700
You like it?

13
00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.260
It's not cheap.

14
00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.020
I'll give you the salary.

15
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.140
What do you want to buy?

16
00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.020
You won't let me return a hundred million.

17
00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:47.380
What is this watch?

18
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.880
I'm afraid you don't carry such a cheap watch.

19
00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:51.060
Like it

20
00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:53.060
Of course I like it.

21
00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:59.700
It's beautiful.

22
00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.660
I'll never forget

23
00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:05.660
The way you were saved.

24
00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:08.680
Me.

25
00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:14.380
As cool as the sea yeah

26
00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.860
Never let your parents fire you.

27
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.280
If I was fired by the story

28
00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.220
No one in this company wants to hire me anymore.

29
00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.320
OK, I'll ask you to first aid, you're out.

30
00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:24.860
You're so selfish.

31
00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:26.000
You're useless.

32
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.200
Even if I protect you.

33
00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:28.940
The story won't keep you long either.

34
00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.060
Now they're a fan.

35
00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:32.840
If I get a resignation story

36
00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.220
Don't blame me for telling the truth. She was stabbed.

37
00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:38.660
What if you hit him?

38
00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.240
I was also in the car.

39
00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.360
Don't worry, you're faking another bleed.

40
00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:45.700
If hired to die

41
00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.580
Is he still running away with you?

42
00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.700
Leave, what's the rush?

43
00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.940
Don't worry, I won't let the story take you away.

44
00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.600
Do Yeon-yeon and Fang-ming know each other?

45
00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.780
When did they get to know each other?
