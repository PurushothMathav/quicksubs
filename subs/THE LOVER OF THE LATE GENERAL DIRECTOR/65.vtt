00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:05.360
Master, why don't you explain it to people?

2
00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:06.380
Explain what?

3
00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:09.420
We're not that kind of relationship.

4
00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:12.580
I feel like there's nothing to explain.

5
00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:14.540
It's cold outside.

6
00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:19.540
The late CEO, I think we should keep our distance.

7
00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.780
I just saved you, and this is how you repay me.

8
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.440
I know you've helped me many times.

9
00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:31.180
But I don t want to ruin the relationship between you and Yeon-yeon.

10
00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:33.800
I will definitely find a way to repay your kindness to me.

11
00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:34.600
Okay.

12
00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.720
So how do you want to return the favor?

13
00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:40.180
What can I get in return?

14
00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.860
I can only work hard to repay you not enough.

15
00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:51.420
So after every month in addition to living expenses, you don't have to pay me any other salary.

16
00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.300
I'm really interested in your three melons and two scrubs.

17
00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.740
So what do you want?

18
00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.480
You say as long as I have

19
00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.140
So what do I want?

20
00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:10.900
What would you give?

21
00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.060
Why are you here?

22
00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.040
Yeon-yeon, why are you here?

23
00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.500
I heard you were injured, so I came right away.

24
00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.420
Lin Lin, why are you here?

25
00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.580
Snow, how are you?

26
00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:26.020
Does the other head hurt?

27
00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:31.000
It's okay, the doctor said it won't scar after a few days.

28
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.580
Why so tight?
