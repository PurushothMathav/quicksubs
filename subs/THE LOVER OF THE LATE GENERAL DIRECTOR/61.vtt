00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:06.640
The land south of the Gu Zong city is not that I don't want to share with you.

2
00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:09.140
There are too many people looking for me to work with.

3
00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:13.960
Oh, the price you gave.

4
00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:15.640
It's really awkward for me.

5
00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:16.880
I'm going. I've got a job.

6
00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:17.700
Total amount

7
00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:20.140
Don't hurry.

8
00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.980
Hey, look at this first.

9
00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.300
What is this?

10
00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:28.520
Who drinks?

11
00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:30.660
Come on.

12
00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:34.260
It's my sincerity.

13
00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.460
But it's more than that.

14
00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.100
General Director Chen, please take a look at this first.

15
00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:44.040
Hey.

16
00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.140
Isn't that sensitive?

17
00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.100
Why does he have such a problem?

18
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.420
Sister, help me.

19
00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:07.540
Tieu Vien

20
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.140
I can't believe you are handsome.

21
00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.880
Do you have any money?

22
00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:13.680
Thank you.

23
00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.740
Xiao Yuan, why do you owe so much money?

24
00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.700
I've been calculating, the day before I went on a blind date with that girl.

25
00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.300
He wants a bride price of 200,000.

26
00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.180
I want to get it out.

27
00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.580
He gave me the money I know.

28
00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.980
Then, 200 thousand in a few short years, it became 2 million.

29
00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:34.260
Two hundred thousand turns into two million obvious holes so you jump.

30
00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:35.820
400,000

31
00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:41.920
The black and white letters written on his forehead clearly indicated that the one-month loan was not repaid.

32
00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.540
You're Ben, what's the charge?
