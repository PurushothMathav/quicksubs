00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:13.620
Rest for good.

2
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:15.380
Take care of yourself.

3
00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:34.980
Not from childhood.

4
00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:36.680
For a woman.

5
00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.160
Do you still beat Qin Lao Tam's brother like that?

6
00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:40.660
He hit my people.

7
00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.820
I know, but the land in Ching Nam is very important.

8
00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:48.120
Good friends beat people's brother for a woman

9
00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.100
We lost so much money without saying

10
00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.840
The important thing is that the beam is stuck.

11
00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:52.940
He told me.

12
00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:54.560
The land will not give you.

13
00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:58.300
Don't worry, the land in the Southern Citadel I will definitely win.

14
00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:00.900
It's nothing more than going in circles.

15
00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:04.020
Okay, because you have so many breasts.

16
00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:05.920
Then I won't say much.

17
00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.000
Better to go further.

18
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.100
Don't worry, he's good.

19
00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.900
He works for us.

20
00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.260
When he's done paying off the debt.

21
00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:18.500
When to let him go away bother your secretary

22
00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:22.540
Caring for you like that

23
00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:23.660
Tell the truth.

24
00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.020
How far have you two grown now?

25
00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.300
Comrades leave.

26
00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.020
Is it not for your good health?

27
00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.180
Forget it.

28
00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:42.500
There's no more pain, Secretary Li.

29
00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:43.940
You can ah

30
00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.880
The next year we had a big fight because of you.

31
00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.000
Now that you're in our circle, ah, you're already famous.

32
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.860
Okay, aren't you very busy?

33
00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:54.440
Busy with you, right?

34
00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.180
Okay, then I won't bother you to talk about love. It's not.

35
00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.660
Director General, why don't you explain it to people?

36
00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:02.260
Explain something.
