00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:03.700
This is you forcing me.

2
00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:10.520
Hey.

3
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.580
Don t you have a brother who always wanted to get married?

4
00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:15.420
Arrange for me.

5
00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:17.260
I want to see it.

6
00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:21.100
Snow will not be able to save his brother.

7
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.020
Sister, save me, sister, save me.

8
00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.380
Hey, who are you?

9
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:39.860
What did you do to my brother?

10
00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.400
Hey, you're Nie Xiaoyuan's sister.

11
00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:44.660
Are you bleeding?

12
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.180
Who are you?

13
00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:49.100
How's my brother?

14
00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.280
Your brother owes me two million.

15
00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.960
I'll give you an hour to buy two million dollars.

16
00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.640
If you are late, call the police or go with someone else.

17
00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.860
Your brother's hands are unprotected.

18
00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:02.320
Hey.

19
00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:03.560
Hey.

20
00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:10.740
No.

21
00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.500
They want money.

22
00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.400
If I call the police right now

23
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.820
My brother will be in danger.

24
00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:21.740
The secret says

25
00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:26.920
It is very important to cooperate with the general manager today, I am in the office.

26
00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.060
How could I forget?

27
00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:30.940
The little rain helped me get a leave of absence.

28
00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.220
No, Director General Cuban is talking about a very important partnership.

29
00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:39.660
Can't bother him.

30
00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:45.160
Hi, Song Ye.

31
00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:46.360
Do you have two million?

32
00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:47.420
Let me borrow some.

33
00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:48.560
I don't have that much.

34
00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.060
What's going on? I'll tell you later.

35
00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:52.420
How much money do you have now?

36
00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:54.420
Let me borrow it first.
