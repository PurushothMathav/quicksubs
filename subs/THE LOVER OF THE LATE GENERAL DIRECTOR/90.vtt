1
00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:05.540
I'm not wrong.

2
00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:11.100
Stop shooting, stop shooting.

3
00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.460
harm others

4
00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:17.820
Let me out! Let me out!

5
00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:19.020
Go to the police station later.

6
00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:23.220
Wait, come out, my many years of friendship, I can't destroy you.

7
00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:26.700
Why do you have a nose to say that?

8
00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:28.780
If I'm not lucky

9
00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:31.300
I was ruined by you a long time ago.

10
00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:34.280
Snow, I know I'm wrong.

11
00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.140
I shouldn't, I should be confident, I swear.

12
00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:41.860
Sins can be forgiven.

13
00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:44.900
Doing evil yourself is impossible.

14
00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.260
Everything you do

15
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.660
They will eventually be punished by the law.

16
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.060
Take it.

17
00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:55.260
Head Office

18
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:00.400
Everybody.

19
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.180
This was a little show before I got married.

20
00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:06.880
Now that the show is over, we'll continue.

21
00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.220
Everyone eats well and drinks well.

22
00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:14.000
Now the ceremony is over.

23
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.460
Is it time to get married next?

24
00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:18.260
This really isn't working.

25
00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:21.860
He'll be shy.
