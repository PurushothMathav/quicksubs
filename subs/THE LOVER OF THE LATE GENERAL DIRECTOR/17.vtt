1
00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:03.720
Be withdrawn

2
00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:06.640
What's the situation?

3
00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:09.040
It was the first time I had ever seen a woman like that.

4
00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:10.100
Princess hugging

5
00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.320
It seems that female magic secrets and general Gu s relationship is not normal.

6
00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.260
General Director Gu cares about your admission like this, if I find out that I caused trouble, I will not be able to bear it.

7
00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:19.340
It's okay. Hungry?

8
00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:20.180
Don't stress.

9
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.500
But the bruise is a bit severe.

10
00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:26.420
During the insurance stay in the hospital one day to settle the procedure.

11
00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:28.380
Thank you, doctor.

12
00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:35.140
What?

13
00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:38.380
I destroyed the data.

14
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:39.720
Gotta go see if there's a backup.

15
00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:40.940
You can't delay work.

16
00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.820
Don't worry, data with backups will not delay your work.

17
00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.020
That's good. These two days.

18
00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:49.560
You have to rest here.

19
00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:50.540
Don't go anywhere.

20
00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:53.620
Mr. President, this is sick leave.

21
00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:55.860
You can't deduct my salary, British secretary.

22
00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:08.180
The late general manager, I'll just go to your two-story office.

23
00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.380
Of course.

24
00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.060
It's about how many times I can drink coffee this week.

25
00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.220
You can hit the car a few times without money.

26
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.000
General Director

27
00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:22.440
Why are you here?

28
00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.700
I've come to apologize to others.

29
00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.460
It's still in the hands of the prisoners.

30
00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:29.580
I don't remember much.

31
00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.700
I remember I stumbled upon something.

32
00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:38.380
Well, the person said I'm very sorry. I was in a hurry to misunderstand you in the meeting room just now.
