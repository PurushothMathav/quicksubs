00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:04.100
Come back here. Come back here.

2
00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:12.980
Secretary

3
00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.300
So you're here.

4
00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.060
Current time 11: 39

5
00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:26.140
I'll text you at 10 o'clock asking you to join me for dinner.

6
00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:29.580
Why didn't you answer my message?

7
00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.620
Sorry, I don't have time to read the message.

8
00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.320
Okay, no need next time.

9
00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:45.120
What?

10
00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.820
You feel important, who are you?

11
00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:52.700
It's done.

12
00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.040
This is the Graf Illusion diamond watch that the late CEO just bought.

13
00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:59.940
worth 380 million

14
00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.460
What is 3.81?

15
00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:03.500
It's done.

16
00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.460
This is broken, how much money will it take to fix it?

17
00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:11.780
We can only innovate.

18
00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:20.980
You're the father of the Snow Queen, aren't you?

19
00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.700
The snow is working very well.

20
00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.900
I can give you a discount for his sake.

21
00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:32.860
One hundred million is fine.

22
00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.260
What?

23
00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.140
One hundred million, how could I have so much money?

24
00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.100
No, how do I know if your watch is real or fake?

25
00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.460
The payment slip is here.

26
00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.860
Do you want to go to the police station to check?

27
00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.140
I didn't mean to be alone.

28
00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:01.060
Why did you let me go with you?

29
00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:02.580
You don't want to come, do you?

30
00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.980
Okay.

31
00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.100
Then go to jail.

32
00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.060
If done well

33
00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.900
Ten years, twenty years.
