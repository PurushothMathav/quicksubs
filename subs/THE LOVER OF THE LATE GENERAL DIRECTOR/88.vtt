00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:04.380
You're still worried about right and wrong.

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.540
The fact that you are a girlfriend is also known as a stumbling block.

3
00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:11.860
You still want to lie, right?

4
00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:13.440
Okay.

5
00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:15.500
You said you saved five charities

6
00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:18.860
So when, where and how did you save him?

7
00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.900
I saved it over 20 years ago because there's so much I don't remember.

8
00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.220
Then you don't remember.

9
00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:30.380
So do you have any proof that you saved next year?

10
00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.620
A year later.

11
00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:35.960
That pocket watch, have you forgotten?

12
00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:37.980
You gave me one for each of us.

13
00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:42.900
That's what you said.

14
00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.520
It's not you.

15
00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.340
There's also a childhood photo here.

16
00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:56.460
So why doesn't it look like pictures from a young age?

17
00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:01.020
Remember even though this is different.

18
00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.260
But it's also because I love you so much.

19
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.260
I saved you.

20
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:07.540
Do you want to transfer ownership?

21
00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:08.660
Save my grandmother.

22
00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.780
I beat my daughter and said it was your uncle.

23
00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:27.520
Help with, is to help him stab your grandmother.

24
00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:28.240
I'm not a girl.

25
00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.260
That's enough.

26
00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:33.380
I just wanted to wait for you.

27
00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.400
Break up we are girlfriends

28
00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.020
Listen to me explain.

29
00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.300
You insulted two words girlfriend.
