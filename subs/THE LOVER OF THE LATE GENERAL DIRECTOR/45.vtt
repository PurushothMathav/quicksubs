00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:05.460
That's great.

2
00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:08.980
Signed successfully.

3
00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:11.140
- You can go.

4
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.300
Hey, what are you doing?

5
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.820
Do you really think I want you to pay back the hundred million?

6
00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.540
I was always trying to help out.

7
00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:32.200
Why? Is that watch fake?

8
00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:33.980
The watch is real, of course.

9
00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.340
Try to bring it may be fake.

10
00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:38.680
There's not that much money.

11
00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:40.440
Didn't you see the receipt?

12
00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.060
It's worth it.

13
00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.020
Song Ye, I want to talk to Gu in two sentences.

14
00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:48.200
Then I'll wait for you outside.

15
00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.140
You're welcome, I'll go myself.

16
00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.980
Call me if you have anything.

17
00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:02.780
You two.

18
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:04.820
Good relationship.

19
00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:06.620
We've known each other since we were kids.

20
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.700
Try to sum up this contract

21
00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.260
You can redraw it. No need.

22
00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:13.420
I'm not short of this money.

23
00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.360
It's not a shortage problem.

24
00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.260
I thought you didn't want me to help you?

25
00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:20.900
Of course not.

26
00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.180
I'm grateful.

27
00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.120
But the money is too big.

28
00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:25.380
I don't want to take advantage of you.

29
00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:26.700
Not taking advantage

30
00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.940
The Spanish client you spoke to me last time

31
00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:32.960
More than a hundred million orders.

32
00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:34.180
If you were here

33
00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.580
Can make me countless hundreds of millions.

34
00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:37.700
Say that.

35
00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:39.140
Okay?
