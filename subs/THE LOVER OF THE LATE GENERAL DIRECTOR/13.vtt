00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:05.980
Go back first, secretary.

2
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:10.920
Give it to the company as well.

3
00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.800
All of this should be yours, but from today on

4
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.800
These things have nothing to do with you anymore.

5
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.880
By the way, how's the pocket watch?

6
00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.220
Don't spoil it. There's Ninh Ninh's picture in it.

7
00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.960
And there.

8
00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:27.180
It's okay.

9
00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.620
Your image as a child is really the same as it is now.

10
00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.020
Fortunately, they didn't realize it this year.

11
00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:38.560
As a child you grow up many signs.

12
00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:41.260
Why is this grown?

13
00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:45.760
Oh.

14
00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:46.980
It's okay to be biased.

15
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.480
He's also a good kid.

16
00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.100
Well, don't be self-deprecating, haha.

17
00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:55.260
When people grow up

18
00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.140
Has it really changed as much as it did as a child?

19
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.280
Hey, before the engagement.

20
00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.880
You two moved in together.

21
00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:05.420
Cultivating emotions

22
00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.840
Okay, grandmother, don't worry.

23
00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.500
In a while, I'll have people take off their sun trousers.

24
00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:17.300
Then I'll go first.

25
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.020
Let's go together.
