Slow down, beginner.

2
00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:10.420
Thank you, what are you polite to me for?

3
00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:12.980
So how's your wound?

4
00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:15.720
It's been a long time, almost good.

5
00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:17.840
I can leave the hospital tomorrow, I'll see.

6
00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:20.960
Hey, there's really no trace.

7
00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.020
This doctor prescribed the drug very well.

8
00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:30.720
Well, last week's trail was pretty clear.

9
00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.580
I'm basically not seeing it this week.

10
00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:35.820
Go outside, how do you see the 16th of next month?

11
00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:38.560
It's a good day.

12
00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:39.700
I think so too.

13
00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.980
The doctor said she will probably wake up this month.

14
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.380
So in the next month, this time is enough to organize my wedding and the Golden Lotus.

15
00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.500
It was a really good day.

16
00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.420
That's right, the first snow, you don't even know

17
00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.600
Ever since you found me

18
00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.860
I dream of marrying him every day.

19
00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.060
So congratulations.

20
00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:03.940
Your wish is about to come true.

21
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:04.980
The first snow.

22
00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:07.940
Are you really congratulating me?

23
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.220
Why are you so late?

24
00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:12.140
Is it because of those misunderstandings that you feel me?

25
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.280
Listen to me.

26
00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.120
Because you're my best friend.

27
00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:18.380
So I really want to hear your blessings.

28
00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.380
Yeon Yeon, I sincerely wish you and General Manager Gu a good hundred years.
