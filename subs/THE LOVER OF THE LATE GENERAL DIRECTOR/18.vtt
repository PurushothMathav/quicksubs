00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:05.960
It's okay, is this all about work?

2
00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:09.100
No job is as important as the safety of employees.

3
00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:11.700
There can't be a next time.

4
00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:16.860
Remember what's wrong with you?

5
00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.020
I heard the wind chime telling you to go to the hospital, and I was worried.

6
00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:24.900
What does it have to do with the snow and this woman?

7
00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:28.660
Not my grandfather.

8
00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:30.300
I accidentally fell.

9
00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:31.660
Try to get me here.

10
00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:34.840
Get out, where did you fall?

11
00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:37.300
It's okay, I'll take two days off.

12
00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.120
General Manager Gu thank you

13
00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.660
It's okay here.

14
00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:43.280
I can go outside and talk.

15
00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:44.940
Are you busy first?

16
00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:46.040
Okay.

17
00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.180
Let Fengte stay and give my fiancee the spirit house.

18
00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:51.760
Yes, Mr. President.

19
00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:52.980
I'll wait for you outside.

20
00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.500
You, one day, will not let me worry.

21
00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:03.460
Oh, wasn't this an accident?

22
00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.920
You worry me so much.

23
00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.940
If you don't quit your job, you don't have a lot of monthly salary, I'll give it to you.

24
00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.380
You want to raise me?

25
00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.040
Didn't I tell you?

26
00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.700
who grows who feeds who

27
00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.880
Treat me so well today, I feed you.

28
00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:18.900
It's not that I can't remember.

29
00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.780
Isn't that a joke?

30
00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.640
I still prefer to make my own money.

31
00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.500
It's so exhausting to go to work, I can't bear to let my girlfriend suffer this.

32
00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.940
Yes, but I feel safer.

33
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.820
You're him.

34
00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.640
I think if I marry a good man, he will be good to me.

35
00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.260
It's enough for me to eat and dress without worrying.

36
00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.080
Yeon-yeon is adorable

37
00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.540
I believe the rest of my life will be good for me.

38
00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:47.260
The Snow Department has something to say or not.
