00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:04.860
My mentor I

2
00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:07.140
No need to be so polite.

3
00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:08.940
Just call me from childhood.

4
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.860
I've been waiting for you for 20 years.

5
00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.380
When I was growing up, you were exactly what I imagined.

6
00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:32.100
Keep you waiting

7
00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:33.740
This is the necklace I bought for you.

8
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.340
I like it.

9
00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:39.860
Let's interview.

10
00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:43.660
Promotion Conference

11
00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:47.020
It's coming soon.

12
00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.480
150 million 150 million

13
00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:51.940
I'm rich.

14
00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:53.860
Compared to as a child.

15
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.300
Why has it changed so much?

16
00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:57.800
Ninh Ninh

17
00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.280
I've got to go deal with something.

18
00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:01.540
Then you go.

19
00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:27.500
No, they won't.

20
00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:29.900
You're finally here.

21
00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:34.060
Stay away from me.

22
00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.100
I'm not that you wouldn't charm

23
00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:40.360
Right.

24
00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:42.540
Who seduces you?

25
00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:48.500
Such a narcissistic person, I only have problems with the mind, I consider him as my gentle, understanding brother.

26
00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:58.540
This is what everyone has.

27
00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.260
Mathematics, don't be sad.

28
00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:06.520
What happened, the brother you were waiting for, he sent someone here.

29
00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:07.900
Except for his heart.

30
00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:09.780
I don't want to keep my promise to marry you.

31
00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:12.340
Did he leave contact information?

32
00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.100
I want to hear him speak for himself.

33
00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.980
No, he doesn't want to get involved with you.

34
00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.260
And take your pocket watch.

35
00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.700
Even the love token was taken away.

36
00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:30.020
It turned out that from the beginning to the end, I was the only one who kept the appointment.

37
00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.380
Snow, don't blame me.

38
00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.580
No one can refuse to be a rich lady.

39
00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.100
First snow, you want to open a little?

40
00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.740
Yeon-yeon, where did you get this necklace?
