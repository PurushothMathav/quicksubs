00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:06.260
What are you looking for?

2
00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:09.120
How to talk to your father?

3
00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:10.320
Your brother is getting married today.

4
00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:11.940
The other side wants a bride price of 200,000.

5
00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:17.900
Should you be his sister? I don't have a penny. How can I?

6
00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:21.580
You're a secretary to the General Manager of the No. 1 company in the country.

7
00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.200
Monthly salary from 40,000 to 50,000.

8
00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.100
Who told you this?

9
00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:26.840
Your brother got married, bought a car, bought a house

10
00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:28.540
You give him the bride price of 200,000 first.

11
00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.900
I've only been in the company for a month, how can I earn so much?

12
00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.420
Didn't you work and study before?

13
00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:35.800
Where's your savings?

14
00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.480
Previously in addition to living expenses

15
00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.260
One point counts as one point, aren't they all searched by you?

16
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:41.520
Not a penny, right?

17
00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.180
No, it doesn't matter.

18
00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:45.480
I've taken a picture of an object for you.

19
00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.760
However, even though the other party was married three times.

20
00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.700
The bride over there is ready to give you a gift of 200,000, you can take it first.

21
00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:53.460
Then you transfer Ken's bride price to your brother.

22
00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:55.240
Half a day.

23
00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:56.600
It's waiting for me here.

24
00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:57.480
Why are you talking?

25
00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:58.780
I raised you so big.

26
00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:00.800
It's time to give thanks.

27
00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.240
Since I was born.

28
00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:06.220
After he left me for my grandmother, he didn't pay a penny to feed me.

29
00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.900
Over the years, I've given you all the money you've saved.

30
00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.600
Ascension, I have returned the favor.

31
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.660
Why are you interfering in my life?

32
00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:15.980
Okay, don't say yes.

33
00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.420
I've arranged the engagement.

34
00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:21.980
Calm down and think of a way to keep the old man alive.

35
00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:24.980
You prepare first.

36
00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.340
Go see people.

37
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.200
I'm married.

38
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.300
Who are you going with?

39
00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:35.940
That's the drowned brother I saved 20 years ago.
