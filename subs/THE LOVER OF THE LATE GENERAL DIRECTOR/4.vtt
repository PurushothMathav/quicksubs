00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:04.980
General Director

2
00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.500
You don't want to take another step into the story.

3
00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:15.140
I want to meet a big client in Spain later.

4
00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:18.300
The secretary department is only Ninh Elementary School of Spanish.

5
00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:33.640
I tried to give you a chance.

6
00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.460
Whether you can stay or not is up to you.

7
00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:37.900
I definitely can.

8
00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:40.440
Show off.

9
00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.900
I'm waiting for you to get kicked out of the house.

10
00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.580
I don't see how you can.

11
00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.880
The general secretary's expertise was very interesting.

12
00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:52.580
All his conditions are suitable.

13
00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:02.220
Good sir, we'll have a good corporation.

14
00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:03.700
Have fun.

15
00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.220
Why?

16
00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:10.680
Master, let's go now.

17
00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.980
You can send a transfer request now, and I will transfer the money directly.

18
00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.740
You can do an internship if you want. You don't need it. I will definitely try my best to work.

19
00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.800
There are some parts of beauty.

20
00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.660
Easy to position.

21
00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.160
This suit of yours is not cheap, is it?

22
00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:27.460
Dress up beautiful

23
00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:29.800
I don't like money lovers.

24
00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.120
You don't love money.

25
00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:32.980
So you're working for free for General Manager Gu.

26
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.020
The general manager likes free employees the most.

27
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.900
General Manager Cuban, I like the ability to be worthy of new resources.

28
00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.340
What will you do?

29
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.540
General Director

30
00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.020
Are you okay?

31
00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:05.480
Don't you know how to drive?

32
00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:09.020
I haven't driven much since I got my license.

33
00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.020
Let me help you.

34
00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:19.780
Get out.

35
00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.580
I haven't taken your hand off yet.
