00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.580
You, me and Song Ye are all normal people.

2
00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:07.500
It's not 200,000.

3
00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.200
I told him.

4
00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:10.600
Not a penny for the bride price.

5
00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:11.420
What did you say?

6
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.380
I told you I loved him.

7
00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:16.360
The bride doesn't want a penny.

8
00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:17.540
Don't even think about it.

9
00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:18.980
The first snow.

10
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.160
I raised you so big, why are you so self-deprecating?

11
00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.160
The bride price of 1 point does not need you to fight with you.

12
00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:26.340
You actually introduce yourself.

13
00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.060
In your eyes, am I a commodity?

14
00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:34.060
I can sell it at a good price, don't I give it up myself?

15
00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:35.680
What's that?

16
00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:37.760
There's no price.

17
00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:38.960
You're too much.

18
00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:40.580
How can you say that about your daughter?

19
00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:44.240
In the past, what woman married a man who did not receive the bride price?

20
00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:47.260
Besides, why would I give you a daughter for nothing?

21
00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:50.820
Did I give you 200,000?

22
00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.380
You don't bother Snow anymore.

23
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.020
Simple.

24
00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:58.500
It's okay.

25
00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.780
As long as he doesn't bother you anymore, how much?

26
00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.540
Your secretary is married to a good husband.

27
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.380
Try not to sleep.

28
00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:14.740
Mouth.

29
00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:20.360
Dad.

30
00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.980
This is the last time I'll call you.

31
00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.740
I hope you don't bother my life anymore.

32
00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.480
This gift will not be given to you.

33
00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:30.760
Don't take a penny.

34
00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:32.340
Don't even think about it.

35
00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.120
You know you didn't pay, right?

36
00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:36.940
Divorce I pay you to be on stage

37
00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.300
Let me out! Let me out! What are you doing?
