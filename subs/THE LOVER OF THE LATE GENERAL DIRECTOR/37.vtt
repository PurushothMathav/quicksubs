00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:03.080
No.

2
00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:13.440
No.

3
00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:17.960
No, Silian, this is not a company.

4
00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:19.400
This is between you and me.

5
00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:20.640
I only said it once.

6
00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.080
If you don't want to go to the police station.

7
00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.060
Go away.

8
00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:26.280
General Director

9
00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.320
Why? Don't worry.

10
00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.600
Dear General Manager, I didn't have any more of your yellow bags.

11
00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.560
I promise I'll never find you again.

12
00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:37.880
You're having trouble with bleeding.

13
00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:39.140
You let us go.

14
00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:40.820
Take him to the police station.

15
00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:42.180
Your number doesn't believe it.

16
00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:43.180
And...

17
00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:46.180
Anyone out from the wedding tonight?

18
00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:48.540
You can be consistent.

19
00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.740
General Manager Gu, thank you for helping me invite you to eat today.

20
00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:01.920
I never eat junk food.

21
00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.200
Oh, General Manager.

22
00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.760
It's really delicious.

23
00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:06.080
Just try it.

24
00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.160
Eat.

25
00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:09.660
Helped me many times.

26
00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.060
Tasty?

27
00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.140
Just work well later.

28
00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:24.960
Yes.

29
00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:26.500
It's no problem.

30
00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.060
That you're married.
