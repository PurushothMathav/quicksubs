00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:09.220
Looks like I'm crazy.

2
00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:12.540
I remember a crazy drunk life.

3
00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:19.860
Are you going?

4
00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.180
General Director Wang, listen to me.

5
00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.500
The king could not send a woman.

6
00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.780
Looks like we don't need to cooperate anymore.

7
00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:48.080
It turns out that your performance is based on this.

8
00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:49.520
Come on, listen to me.

9
00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.820
Director Huang, what happened today?

10
00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.600
You should explain.

11
00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.280
The one who has prepared the name of the late general director s fiancee has been revealed.

12
00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.720
I am afraid that such a big city has a place for me.

13
00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:04.820
Director General, please forgive me.

14
00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:06.700
All of them are leaders of the Rebellion.

15
00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:08.800
I'm afraid of committing a crime against him.

16
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.860
affect the interests of the company.

17
00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:12.960
The secretary is just drunk.

18
00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.700
We didn't do anything.

19
00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:17.660
Starting tomorrow.

20
00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:20.380
Do this procedure yourself.

21
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.220
I don't want to see you again.

22
00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.180
The General Director also has

23
00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.020
What would happen today if someone else knew?

24
00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.140
You know what?

25
00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:32.340
The late General

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:37.460
Trying to get back to the old house?

Sister Ninh is drunk.

28
00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.420
If you vomit at night, there may be a risk of choking.

29
00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:48.220
It's not too early.

30
00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:49.280
You go and rest.

31
00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:50.780
Right.

32
00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.940
This general manager still can't rest assured your secretary.

33
00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:30.280
Hey.

34
00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:32.540
The main actor.

35
00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:34.740

Female lead

37
00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.940
