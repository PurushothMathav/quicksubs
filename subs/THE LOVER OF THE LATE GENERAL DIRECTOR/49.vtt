00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:16.760
What are you angry about standing there for?

2
00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:18.020
Call an ambulance.

3
00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:24.860
Ma'am, no one's seen this here.

4
00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.540
I'm obviously going to get a new one.

5
00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.920
You're crazy, this secretary is learning to die.

6
00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:35.940
But the old woman is a lonely old woman, and if he doesn't have a dead father, he should check the window.

7
00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:42.660
Hello 120?

8
00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.580
How to remember you don't worry

9
00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.920
My grandmother is still not out of danger.

10
00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:52.940
But I believe you'll wake up at night.

11
00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:55.620
What's going on?

12
00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:58.960
It was my grandmother who came to see us and was accidentally hit by a car.

13
00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.420
But General Director Choi Ho has already sent it to the police station.

14
00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:05.140
General Director Gu asked the lady to save the old lady this time.

15
00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:06.980
You saved my grandmother.

16
00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.200
Yes, this time the situation is especially dangerous.

17
00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.040
If you don't hug the old lady in time

18
00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:14.220
Then they all blamed me.

19
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.600
If I was faster

20
00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.920
Isn't your grandmother so bad that she's not even in danger?

21
00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:18.780
Fuck you.

22
00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:20.860
Thank you.

23
00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:22.980
Thank you.

24
00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.020
There's no need to say thank you between us.

25
00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:31.020
Let's not talk about this anymore.
