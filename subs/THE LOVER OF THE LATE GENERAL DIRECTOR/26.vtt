00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:08.260
Don't move, baby

3
00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:11.440
Your Majesty.

4
00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:12.380
Why is that?

5
00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.840
Your Majesty, you have not turned over your concubine's sign in a long time.

6
00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:19.020
I am in pain, oh

7
00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:20.740
Don't you study?

8
00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.600
Your Majesty, it is so good of you to call me.

9
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.620
Why do you drink so much wine alone?

10
00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.140
You don't want to die.

11
00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.380
Your Majesty, don't.

12
00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:40.480
Do you remember White?

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:44.260
I trained for a thousand years and finally found you.

14
00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.060
Little White, right?

15
00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.260
Yes to you, young man.

16
00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:53.820
Can you hear me?

17
00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:55.860
Thank you.

18
00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.460
Later, if we're not here.

19
00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:01.900
You dare to drink so much more.

20
00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:04.220
Okay a

21
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:10.460
Rest well.

22
00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.380
We go out and do something else.

23
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.060
You saved me as a child.

24
00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:21.740
The Secret of the Song

25
00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:28.060
What is the name of England?

26
00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:30.100
What name?

27
00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.220
I don't know.

28
00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:36.240
female main

29
00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:37.720
female main

30
00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:39.840
You finish talking and go to sleep.

31
00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:40.440
Let's finish talking and sleep.

32
00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:41.540
Hurry up.

33
00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:45.780
The aliens are hit in limbo
