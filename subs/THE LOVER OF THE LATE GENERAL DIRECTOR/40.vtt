00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:05.540
Right? Maybe you're thanking him too much.

2
00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:11.080
That's right, hot pot needs a lot of people to eat together to be happy.

3
00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:12.540
You can call Yeon Yeon together.

4
00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.740
OK, I'll call him, eat well first.

5
00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.860
Zhang Lin, a little piece of trash, let's go out and have a look.

6
00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.900
Okay, don't worry about him.

7
00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:39.120
My sister and I ate hot pot in the old place.

8
00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.220
How long has it been since we got together, do you want to come?

9
00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:44.960
It's too late, Van Phu worries that it's not safe to go out at night.

10
00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:46.300
Don't let me go out

11
00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.580
Eat yourselves.

12
00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:50.820
Alo Alo

13
00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.880
Tell him he's afraid to go out at night.

14
00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:00.260
He's safe not to come.

15
00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.740
Right?

16
00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:06.540
Then it's okay, we'll eat ourselves.

17
00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.440
This would rather change now for real.

18
00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.740
Talk about him every day like a kiss.

19
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.460
It is boring to be afraid of others not knowing how much this fiancÃ© loves him.

20
00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:18.220
Every time.

21
00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:20.620
Someone remembers.

22
00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:22.540
That's good.

23
00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:32.460
Who am I?

24
00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:35.340
I'm bleeding, right?

25
00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:38.160
Uh, it's you.

26
00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:39.480
Bloody married, you know.

27
00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:40.620
what do you say

28
00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:42.860
Out he's married.

29
00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:46.540
Well, do you know his name, the man who just got married?

30
00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:50.660
Why would he lie?

31
00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:53.980
Uncle Snow, he's not married.

32
00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.460
He could be joking.

33
00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:59.860
Well, you've got to find him.

34
00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.380
Ok, I'll give you the address.

35
00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:11.140
Other people can't catch you.

36
00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:15.260
Then let's see how you handle that bloodsucker.
