00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:06.700
What's wrong with you?

2
00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:08.780
It's in your eyes.

3
00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:11.060
I'm an autocrat.

4
00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:13.340
Of course not.

5
00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:15.600
You re best at collecting employee ideas.

6
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.240
Where is the authority?

7
00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:19.300
A cold-blooded capitalist.

8
00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.180
Not yet.

9
00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:24.420
You are the best, warmest, happiest person with the owner.

10
00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:26.060
Still one.

11
00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.260
Leather Hook

12
00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:34.860
God, I was wrong.

13
00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:36.000
Don't be angry.

14
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.720
You can punish me whatever you want.

15
00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:39.020
I admit it.

16
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.960
I dare not punish you.

17
00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:43.580
If your husband knows

18
00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:45.440
Then you won't find me here.

19
00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:46.500
Husband

20
00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.980
Master, did you say it wasn't Song Ye?

21
00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.180
Why do you have more than one husband?

22
00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:54.480
You're wrong.

23
00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:55.900
I'm not married.

24
00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:58.240
Fingernails

25
00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.760
Well, last time I was afraid my dad was dragging me into an engagement.

26
00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.220
So let's get a fake marriage certificate.

27
00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:04.840
Let Song Ye pretend to be my husband.

28
00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:07.700
What does Song Ye have to do with you?

29
00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.900
That's your boyfriend.

30
00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:13.160
Of course not.

31
00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:14.940
Song Song is my good friend.

32
00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.500
I work overtime with my friends every day.

33
00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.140
How do we have time to love?

34
00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:21.660
Really?

35
00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:24.300
So I seem to have misunderstood.

36
00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:29.860
I have no husband, no boyfriend.

37
00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:36.900
And say no, you see how big the curvature of the corners of the mouth is.

38
00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.080
No, I don't, you do.

39
00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.380
- You're laughing at me.

40
00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:49.020
So that's what I'm going to take you back to.

41
00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:54.120
All right.

42
00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.300
Three times twice seduced me
