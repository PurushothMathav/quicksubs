00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.400
10 years, thank you for shopping for my wedding today.

2
00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:12.560
But our most important ring hasn't been bought yet.

3
00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:14.180
You can choose with me tomorrow.

4
00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:16.220
So many rings.

5
00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:18.600
You don't like it?

6
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.760
Like, but I just need you to come with me to choose for yourself.

7
00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:24.260
The meaning is not the same.

8
00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.380
I'm very busy.

9
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.140
Tell me.

10
00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.160
Hey, is this the secretary's car?

11
00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.460
Why in the old house?

12
00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:46.160
Ninh's secretary came to give her a wedding dress.

13
00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:47.600
Why haven't you fired him yet?

14
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.060
No, you can't let Xining destroy you.

15
00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:54.040
What's going on?

16
00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.380
I'm a little upset.

17
00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:00.060
Take him to the hospital.

18
00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:02.820
Miss Yen.

19
00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:05.100
No, I'm not hurt.

20
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.180
Running that fast?

21
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.860
Ma'am, you've got a misunderstanding.

22
00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.860
I didn't resign because I didn't want anything to do with the late CEO.

23
00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.240
Okay, stop pretending in front of me.

24
00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:21.800
The last time Ninh Ninh saved me in a car accident, I couldn t let you stay here and cause trouble.

25
00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.980
Last time you were in a car accident, it was me who pushed you out.

26
00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:27.380
What did you say?

27
00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.060
You saved me.
