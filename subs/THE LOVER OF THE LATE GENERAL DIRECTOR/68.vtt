00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:05.100
I know you'll bless me.

2
00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.480
You go out, you control your heart.

3
00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:10.220
It doesn't belong to you, don't think about it.

4
00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:14.560
First snow, so I went to the wedding without a bridesmaid.

5
00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:16.260
Can you be my bridesmaid?

6
00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:17.720
I can't.

7
00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:19.100
Why not?

8
00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:21.380
It's not always like that.

9
00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:23.840
How can you find me as a bridesmaid?

10
00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:26.400
Not suitable, you are my best friend.

11
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.920
I said appropriate is appropriate.

12
00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:29.420
There will be no objection this year.

13
00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:30.620
No.

14
00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.320
Why not this year?

15
00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.140
I want to go out and be a bridesmaid.

16
00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:37.780
I don't want to think about it.

17
00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:39.420
Is it dangerous?

18
00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:41.260
We'll talk about this later.

19
00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:42.660
Let's think together.

20
00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.140
Dear, let's decide first.

21
00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.120
Zhang just needs to get a certificate.

22
00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.300
When she woke up, what about the snow?

23
00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.400
Raw rice has been cooked for a long time.

24
00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.020
When I was pregnant.

25
00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:02.880
In the end, Gu Tu Ninh even discovered that Ninh Sister Snow was his lover.

26
00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:04.140
Not that far, is it?

27
00:01:04.719 --> 00:01:06.360
Yes, we apply for a license first.

28
00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.260
Maybe after we get the license, which is so good, you let your grandmother wake up earlier.

29
00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:11.260
That's bullshit.

30
00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.180
You can have this kind of feudal superstition.

31
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.020
She's awake.
