00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:05.780
This is Sister Snow's husband.

2
00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:09.720
Mr. Matsuno, why are you here?

3
00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:11.000
I heard you got your revenge.

4
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.260
Hurry up, how are you, are you okay? Hurry up and let me see.

5
00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:16.300
It's okay.

6
00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:17.740
Thanks to the director today.

7
00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:20.440
Thank you General Manager Gu for taking care of my bleeding house.

8
00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:21.860
He's my secretary.

9
00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:23.860
I should take care of him.

10
00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.940
Well, I'll thank the director next time.

11
00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:29.640
Come out, let's go home.

12
00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.340
The general manager has thanked you today.

13
00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.740
Director General, what's wrong with you?

14
00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:37.340
Where's the pain?

15
00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.260
Maybe he just got hurt.

16
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.100
Wounded but didn't they beat you?

17
00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:45.940
How can you get hurt?

18
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.020
Umm.

19
00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.300
Maybe I just did.

20
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.260
I accidentally hit it just now.

21
00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.020
Oh, there's no power in this whole body.

22
00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:57.860
How to drive.

23
00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.320
Mr. President, don't drive today.

24
00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.440
I'll drive you home, no need to go out.

25
00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.340
Give me the key and I'll take you home, no need.

26
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.740
Secretary, just be serious with me.

27
00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:08.620
Oh secretary Ho

28
00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.120
How about today?

29
00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:14.300
I'll pick you up in the morning.
