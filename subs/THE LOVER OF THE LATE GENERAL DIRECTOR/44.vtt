00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:05.040
The late CEO, I really didn't mean to.

2
00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.280
I have a son in my house, I can't go in like that.

3
00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:09.420
So what?

4
00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:12.620
Can I eat this?

5
00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.020
Hey, I have a daughter who says the market is rich.

6
00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:17.000
Let him pay.

7
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.580
How do I have so much money?

8
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.560
Uncle, are you such a father?

9
00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.000
The accident was also my daughter.

10
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:22.800
Shut up!

11
00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:26.660
Paperwork, you returned this to a volunteer.

12
00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:28.180
I'll handle the physical relationship with you.

13
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.000
What if I don't look for you later?

14
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.220
How can I have a father like you?

15
00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.580
You did well at the company.

16
00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.700
If you think about it, sign now.

17
00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.180
When did you pay the money, when did you sign?

18
00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.220
First snow, shut up.

19
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:48.700
Oh, my God.

20
00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.380
I can sign.

21
00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.540
But first I'm going to write the end of my relationship with you.

22
00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.700
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

23
00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.060
General Director

24
00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.220
I hope you can be a witness.

25
00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:14.420
All right.

26
00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.180
You returned a hundred million.

27
00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.500
I promise I won't look for you again.

28
00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:24.960
Wait, if you want to sign.

29
00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.060
Maybe I'll stay at my company for the rest of my life.

30
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.100
Are you sure?

31
00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.460
I'll definitely refund the money.
