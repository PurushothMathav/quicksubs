00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:07.600
The doctor said it was a minor concussion.

3
00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.140
Just rest for a while.

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:11.780

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:18.200
Health is important.

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:28.860
From Ninh you protect this grandmother you can't stand your health, you go and rest

13
00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:30.460
It's okay.

14
00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:33.060

15
00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:34.820
Bring my information here.

16
00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:37.960
I'm not going, the secretary is not well.

17
00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:39.900
His family told me to leave him.

18
00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.340
The body is not well

19
00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.100
What about when?

20
00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:49.660
I was also told by my family this morning.

21
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.140
You keep an eye on the old lady I don't bother

22
00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:01.620
Is it serious? He's a girl who doesn't feel comfortable resting for a while.

23
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:03.820
Go to the computer.

24
00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:05.980
There's a ring I took.

25
00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:08.420
Five important spiritual words

26
00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.500
It's okay five words.

27
00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:11.840
When will you marry me?

28
00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.240
Before you say choose a good day, have a wedding.

29
00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.180
I've picked the good days.

30
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.060
Wait until grandma wakes up and talk later.

31
00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:31.780
Come in and talk later.

32
00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.100

33
00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:37.780
