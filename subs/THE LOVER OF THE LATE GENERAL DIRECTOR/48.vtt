00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:05.740
He didn't realize I was putting him out.

2
00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.700
I'm wrong. I won't do that again.

3
00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:10.960
I drank too much.

4
00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:12.380
That's what confusion is.

5
00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.140
Don't blame me, okay?

6
00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.500
You drink too much.

7
00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.740
I swear I drank too much, don't hold it against me, okay?

8
00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:21.480
If you like me that way

9
00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.060
He wants to know he's going to collapse.

10
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:25.900
I promise I'll keep it a secret.

11
00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:27.640
But only this time.

12
00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.020
I promise I'll be out.

13
00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.180
The late general manager, I went to buy pastries and got off work.

14
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.460
I just bought it on the way.

15
00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:43.440
Eat.

16
00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.420
What's that look?

17
00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:52.540
You're welcome, I'm back.

18
00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:54.660
Today is your birthday.

19
00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:57.580
It's like a green bean cake that I specifically bought for him.

20
00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:59.080
You.

21
00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:00.700
- Take me home.

22
00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.540
It was so good for Yeon Yeon.

23
00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:07.420
Why is Yeon-yeon so confused?

24
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.540
Ma'am, we're not asking you to hire a director.

25
00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:13.420
Can we not stay home?

26
00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.260
It's okay, you can wait any time.

27
00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.640
Boy, he didn't bring his age to see me.

28
00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.700
I have to visit them.

29
00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.000
It's a cold night.

30
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.260
There is a small shop next door.

31
00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.900
I'll go get you some hot water.

32
00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.020
Let you arrange someone.

33
00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:36.440
Excuse me.

34
00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:37.540
I'm not doing a good job.

35
00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:39.960
Nothing happened?

36
00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.000
What could happen?

37
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.300
Nothing happened.

38
00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.520
Didn't that man say he slept with a woman?

39
00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.140
Who did you sleep with?

40
00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:01.460
Convenient to look at people.

41
00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:03.640
Be careful.
