00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:05.160
Fang Ming, keep trying.

2
00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:06.360
Well done this time.

3
00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:07.120
Thank you, Director Huang.

4
00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:08.420
I'll keep trying.

5
00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.740
Director Huang, I'm sorry.

6
00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:15.740
Did I make the translation materials for the star project that Phuong Minh gave you?

7
00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:18.500
Then you can send me the original documents.

8
00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:19.820
Wait a minute.

9
00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.140
Why is my computer broken?

10
00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.000
Director, there's a problem with my computer.

11
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.280
But please believe me.

12
00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:32.440
This translation document was created by me.

13
00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:35.820
You go outside, I'll work overtime to finish the project first.

14
00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.340
You don't have to continue the recipe out of jealousy

15
00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:42.260
Phong Minh, I know you're jealous because I stole your promotion opportunity.

16
00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.020
But you don't have to.

17
00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:47.260
Okay, you don't speak Spanish.

18
00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.220
At a time you've never had.

19
00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.780
Join me tonight for the Moonlight Project.

20
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.340
Director, we're talking about the name that took my job.

21
00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.300
If you protect her like this, you will not be afraid.

22
00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:00.320
You threaten me, don't you?

23
00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.340
If there's no evidence, shut up.

24
00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:06.100
I will definitely prove that I worked overtime to translate this document.

25
00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.180
Mr. Wang is in charge today, thank you.

26
00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.600
But are you sure you want him to talk about the project with you?

27
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.120
He's the only person in the entire company who knows how to translate Spanish.

28
00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:24.360
I'll have General Manager try to send him with me later.

29
00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.820
Don't worry, the video and picture you want will be given to you after it is completed.

30
00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:36.180
You mean that between 9: 50 and 10: 10 yesterday, the surveillance camera broke down.

31
00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:37.820
Can't it be restored?

32
00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:39.140
Can not be restored

33
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.020
How can I damage my computer and monitor at the same time?

34
00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.820
This guy thinks it's really comprehensive.

35
00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:55.420
General Director Do, wasn't your secretary sent to her room by you?

36
00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.980
Why hasn't he been to the Crown Hotel?
