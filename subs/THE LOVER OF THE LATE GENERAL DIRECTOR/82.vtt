00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:04.180
Inside is the government.

2
00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.860
But I don't understand.

3
00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.340
Aren't they girlfriends?

4
00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:14.260
Why do you think you re trying so hard?

5
00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:18.580
A heroine.

6
00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:22.340
Your cake.

7
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.080
The cake must be sold out.

8
00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:27.000
It's almost done.

9
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.100
Unfortunately, you come to mathematics.

10
00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:29.420
You have to help me this weekend.

11
00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:31.140
Say hello to me.

12
00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.760
I've been resting for days.

13
00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:34.240
The limbs are about to degenerate.

14
00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:35.660
Fit the tendon.

15
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.020
Welcome.

16
00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:40.140
What are you doing here?

17
00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:42.740
Snow Chau

18
00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.420
Has General Manager Gu crossed the border yet?

19
00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.300
Snow is also taught by you.

20
00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.260
What does my name have to do with you?

21
00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.280
Your General Manager

22
00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:55.460
Why are you here?

23
00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:57.860
Snow, I ask you.

24
00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:00.860
Have you ever wronged yourself before?

25
00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:02.500
How is that possible?

26
00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:03.900
He's my best friend.

27
00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:05.780
Why are you so late?

28
00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:08.220
I found something.

29
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.540
What the Word did to you.

30
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.220
What's wrong?

31
00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:17.380
See for yourself.
