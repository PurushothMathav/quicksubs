00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:03.120
Oh.

2
00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:10.480
Oh, this blur isn't clear at all.

3
00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:12.300
Is it a little clearer?

4
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.600
Ma'am, when I was a kid, I didn't like taking pictures.

5
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.700
The only thing I can find is this.

6
00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:19.940
Grandmother, I'm Ninh Ninh.

7
00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.980
Is it wrong to come back this year?

8
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.540
Oh, looks like I'm really getting old.

9
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.900
Come in. Come in.

10
00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.140
Can we go? Can we go?

11
00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:06.260
Ninh Ninh, if not at first the family tried to expand overseas markets

12
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.060
It's impossible not to see my grandson for 20 years.

13
00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.080
Now you two are back together.

14
00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.440
Granny, but I'm so happy.

15
00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.540
Granny, I'm so glad I can go to the rescue with Cilian again.

16
00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.420
This is all the emperor's green jewelry.

17
00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.860
There is also a helicopter and three flight routes.

18
00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:36.120
It's all given to you as a gift.

19
00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:39.740
Haha, this is all for opening my mouth so wide.

20
00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.300
Waiting for you to marry him.

21
00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:47.400
Your grandmother is buying you a holiday island as a wedding present.

22
00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.300
Haha, thank you.

23
00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.060
I will spend the rest of my life with my sister.

24
00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:57.820
OK, then you can quickly choose a good day to fix the wedding date.

25
00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.900
Grandmother, I'm 10 years old today.

26
00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:07.160
The girl.

27
00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:09.080
Girl, is the girl okay?

28
00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:10.940
Let me see.

29
00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:13.380
It's okay, grandmother, I'm fine.
