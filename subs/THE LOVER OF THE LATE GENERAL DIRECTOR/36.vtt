00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:03.280
Chu, I'll go first.

2
00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:04.660
Goodbye. See you tomorrow.

3
00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:11.220
It's him.

4
00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:15.920
English secretary, where are you? I'm off work.

5
00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:18.420
The plan you were told to do last time isn't done yet.

6
00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.700
Uncle Wei, I'll keep you waiting.

7
00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.620
Secretary Lin, what's wrong with you, Zhang Lin?

8
00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:28.740
What do you mean when you take so many people to Bach Thien port to stop me?

9
00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:31.980
Can you come with me for a hundred days?

10
00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.220
My green tea is coming.

11
00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:35.540
Don't open it for you.

12
00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.560
You've lost my job, and now you've done this to me.

13
00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:40.940
What do you mean?

14
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.120
I'm sorry.

15
00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.740
Who wants you to apologize?

16
00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.820
So we can talk about what you want

17
00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:49.880
We have nothing to say.

18
00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:51.980
Guys, hit him.

19
00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:53.920
Are you not afraid that I will sue you?

20
00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.300
Go.

21
00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:57.020
You're in danger.
