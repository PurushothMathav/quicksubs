00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:06.800
Register a car accident

2
00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:10.340
There's another colleague.

3
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.700
All you should do.

4
00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:16.020
Not only does he want to be with our people.

5
00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:17.340
When?

6
00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:20.540
The night before the accident, we had known each other for so long.

7
00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:22.580
I can't believe I like that.

8
00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.460
It can only be said that those who know the face do not know the heart.

9
00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.580
Ning, why did he treat you like that?

10
00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:30.780
I don't know.

11
00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.620
Apparently, the last time there was an accident, an ambulance was called to save me.

12
00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:38.660
It was a car accident that was caused by you and Fangming together.

13
00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.140
If there's anything wrong with my grandmother, I'll check it out.

14
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.380
He was afraid I would be hunted.

15
00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:47.480
It's called an ambulance.

16
00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.040
Then I brought it with me.

17
00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.500
Turns out he called an ambulance just to hide the truth.

18
00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:55.880
He hates you so much.

19
00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:57.340
There can't be no reason.

20
00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.500
First snow, think about it.

21
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.260
When did he start to have anomalies?

22
00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.460
He called me the day you enlisted and told me to fire you.

23
00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.500
Turns out he hated me so early.

24
00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:11.660
But clearly before that.

25
00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.740
He even took me to the wedding dress shop to see my brother who broke his contract.

26
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.220
Brother broke the contract, you are friends

27
00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:20.660
You saved me.
