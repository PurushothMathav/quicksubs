00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:05.520
General Director

2
00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.140
The Director General is

3
00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:10.940
How's your illness?

4
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.780
This replenishes the body.

5
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.120
It's done.

6
00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:15.060
Thank you General Director

7
00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.180
What about the document I asked you to translate?

8
00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.540
That's what I tried.

9
00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.340
I've translated it.

10
00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:31.260
Small people succeed.

11
00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:34.620
Wait until I find a computer repair master.

12
00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:36.820
Be sure to get the evidence to hit you in the face.

13
00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.540
But your computer hasn't been repaired.

14
00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:45.440
No, I've looked for a lot of teachers.

15
00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:46.580
Can't fix it.

16
00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:48.980
We can only continue to find good technical teachers.

17
00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:51.860
This is me staying up late working overtime to kick out.

18
00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.720
See if there are any other changes.

19
00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:57.700
Details on this translation

20
00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.640
Isn t it only your English books that have this habit?

21
00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.380
This project is translated by you.

22
00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:10.420
Okay, you go down first.

23
00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.340
Master Fengtai, how do I remember that Secretary Ninh is in charge of this project?

24
00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.460
I heard that Secretary Ninh's computer is broken.

25
00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.360
A lot of data backup machines don't.

26
00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.180
We can only move the project forward.

27
00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:28.660
Let Bruce come to my office for a ride.

28
00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.420
Let Secretary Ninh bring the computer here.
