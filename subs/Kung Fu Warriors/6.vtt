00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:04.433
Why is this rope broken again?

2
00:00:26.366 --> 00:00:27.666
It was him

3
00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:32.000
Wushuang, come, come, grandpa Zhang

4
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:37.933
This guy wants to say that my Tai Chi is not standard.

5
00:00:37.933 --> 00:00:40.066
I've been practicing for over ten years

6
00:00:40.066 --> 00:00:41.366
Help me evaluate

7
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.100
Grandpa Zhang, I don't know Tai Chi either.

8
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.000
Hey

9
00:00:45.266 --> 00:00:49.033
You are trained in a martial arts gym, and you still don't know Tai Chi

10
00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:50.566
Don't be modest.

11
00:00:50.566 --> 00:00:51.366
I have something else to do

12
00:00:51.366 --> 00:00:52.566
I'll go first

13
00:00:56.166 --> 00:00:57.300
Reach out so quickly

14
00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:58.866
Looking for bad things

15
00:00:58.966 --> 00:01:00.300
Why is it so familiar?

16
00:01:00.466 --> 00:01:02.766
Grandpa Zhang, take it easy

17
00:01:02.766 --> 00:01:05.200
The girl stretched out her hand so quickly

18
00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.200
Why don't you have time to learn?

19
00:01:20.733 --> 00:01:23.000
Good good master trick

20
00:01:25.666 --> 00:01:27.000
It's getting late to go downstairs

21
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.266
Grandpa Zhang, my sister is still waiting for me at home

22
00:01:29.266 --> 00:01:30.600
I'm leaving first.

23
00:01:39.366 --> 00:01:40.166
Ye Shao

24
00:01:40.333 --> 00:01:43.166
You're a three-time world champion.

25
00:01:43.166 --> 00:01:44.800
You would actually fight someone in the park

26
00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:45.966
tied

27
00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:48.233
That little girl

28
00:01:48.666 --> 00:01:49.966
It's not easy.

29
00:01:50.733 --> 00:01:51.900
Not a tie

30
00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:57.633
Yes I said
