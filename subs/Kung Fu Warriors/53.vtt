00:00:00.566 --> 00:00:02.133
I know a prosecutor.

2
00:00:02.133 --> 00:00:05.166
When he was just and moving things came out

3
00:00:05.166 --> 00:00:07.366
He's been looking into it.

4
00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.433
If you have enough evidence

5
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.366
Will be able to dismantle this bullfight

6
00:00:12.733 --> 00:00:14.166
It's not that simple.

7
00:00:14.266 --> 00:00:16.400
Dongying's power is misunderstood

8
00:00:16.733 --> 00:00:19.966
The power of opening a prosecutor may be difficult to match

9
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.433
Yeah, that's why I need your help.

10
00:00:22.666 --> 00:00:25.000
What was I supposed to do?

11
00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:26.466
I want to be fully motivated

12
00:00:26.466 --> 00:00:29.600
You need to know the names of all the executives

13
00:00:29.866 --> 00:00:33.766
These executives infiltrated financial documents and even the military

14
00:00:33.766 --> 00:00:35.800
Only by dismantling the original of these high-rise buildings

15
00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.933
To completely uproot this cancer

16
00:00:38.933 --> 00:00:39.766
high-rise

17
00:00:41.966 --> 00:00:44.166
Who would have such a fate in Dongying?

18
00:00:44.166 --> 00:00:48.000
I guess I can only sit in the position of k Dacheng

19
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
To be able to access all the senior management

20
00:00:50.566 --> 00:00:52.366
Once it is likely in his hands

21
00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.266
Isn't Lord Wei Mulin?

22
00:00:55.366 --> 00:00:59.033
I haven't seen him since Mullin

23
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.766
If it's hard, no.

24
00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.100
Uncle Wang, I will definitely find a way to get it.

25
00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.166
Don't worry.

26
00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:07.533
OK

27
00:01:08.866 --> 00:01:10.066
I am waiting for your message.

28
00:01:10.466 --> 00:01:12.033
You can come to me all over the country at any time.

29
00:01:13.533 --> 00:01:16.300
Uncle Wang, then I will leave first

30
00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.600
Thank you for giving me hope to live

31
00:01:21.866 --> 00:01:23.300
You have to be extra careful

32
00:01:23.566 --> 00:01:25.300
Don't be too hasty.

33
00:01:26.533 --> 00:01:28.100
Oh, right.

34
00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:29.300
I'll tell you what.

35
00:01:29.733 --> 00:01:30.966
All taken away

36
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.266
Oh, I see.
