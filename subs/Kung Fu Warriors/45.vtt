00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.600
No, Miss's efforts were excellent

2
00:00:02.733 --> 00:00:04.733
Video of the game in your east camp

3
00:00:04.733 --> 00:00:07.166
It was spread to major casinos and the Internet

4
00:00:07.166 --> 00:00:09.033
But got a lot of help

5
00:00:09.266 --> 00:00:11.900
It turns out that the video of me and Dongying playing

6
00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:13.966
You really put it online?

7
00:00:14.533 --> 00:00:16.066
Why would you do that?

8
00:00:16.766 --> 00:00:18.733
What else can I do for

9
00:00:18.733 --> 00:00:20.433
Of course it's for the money

10
00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.166
The largest source of income for Dongying organizations

11
00:00:23.166 --> 00:00:24.633
Just very gambling

12
00:00:25.166 --> 00:00:27.066
As long as you provide the audience with a good time

13
00:00:27.066 --> 00:00:28.500
A fun game

14
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.166
They will willingly put the money

15
00:00:31.166 --> 00:00:32.666
Delivered to you

16
00:00:35.266 --> 00:00:37.066
This is my black-hearted money.

17
00:00:37.333 --> 00:00:39.666
Don't you feel uneasy about your conscience?

18
00:00:40.366 --> 00:00:44.033
Do you know how many people have died in this kind of gambling?

19
00:00:46.133 --> 00:00:49.000
What does their life have to do with me?

20
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.800
I just want money

21
00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:52.166
Say

22
00:00:52.366 --> 00:00:55.300
Are those who gamble for granted?

23
00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.700
Don't they want to get rich overnight?

24
00:01:01.166 --> 00:01:02.566
I thought revenge

25
00:01:03.466 --> 00:01:05.466
It was a calculation

26
00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:07.000
Do not say

27
00:01:07.933 --> 00:01:09.033
What do you do?

28
00:01:09.733 --> 00:01:11.233
What should I do?

29
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
I've hurt so many people

30
00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.966
Miss Mu, your martial arts skills are so superb

31
00:01:22.266 --> 00:01:24.800
Why don't you join our Dongying organization?

32
00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.800
How about sharing this glory with us?

33
00:01:30.766 --> 00:01:32.300
Who the hell are you?

34
00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.100
You don't need to know this.

35
00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:44.366
It's You
