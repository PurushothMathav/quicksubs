00:00:07.866 --> 00:00:09.966
Fucking bitch dares to hit my brother

2
00:00:10.166 --> 00:00:12.766
Somebody clean him up for me

3
00:00:14.066 --> 00:00:15.266
Let's go!

4
00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.666
Ok you have kind

5
00:00:22.066 --> 00:00:23.900
I see you can be rampant into the tens

6
00:00:25.333 --> 00:00:26.366
Come

7
00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.166
I'll bet you something else now

8
00:00:40.966 --> 00:00:42.033
Did you see it?

9
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:44.433
Within a pillar of incense

10
00:00:44.933 --> 00:00:46.300
If you can defeat Tongtong

11
00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.866
Even if you don't

12
00:00:49.566 --> 00:00:51.100
Even if you lose

13
00:01:00.866 --> 00:01:03.166
Now you're going to take a big advantage

14
00:01:03.166 --> 00:01:05.166
How can a kid like that win?

15
00:01:05.166 --> 00:01:07.133
Don't underestimate me

16
00:01:07.133 --> 00:01:09.200
I heard about the satanic organization in the pound country

17
00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:12.400
From an early age, children are trained to fight tigers and wolves

18
00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.033
When I grow up, I am more ferocious than a beast

19
00:01:15.333 --> 00:01:17.600
The child's eyes are empty and weak

20
00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.366
What exactly had happened to him?

21
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.500
How did it go?

22
00:01:25.566 --> 00:01:27.266
If you are afraid, quickly admit defeat

23
00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.233
I can give you a whole body

24
00:01:38.133 --> 00:01:41.366
Why is this child so young?

25
00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:43.166
As I expected

26
00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.000
This must be the rumored son of Satan

27
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.566
Once the target is selected

28
00:01:47.566 --> 00:01:48.900
It becomes entangled with the target

29
00:01:49.466 --> 00:01:50.866
never die

30
00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:52.800
Or kill him

31
00:01:53.133 --> 00:01:54.366
Or be killed by him

32
00:01:55.733 --> 00:01:57.900
So now what?

33
00:01:58.066 --> 00:02:00.433
If he softens his heart, he will die.

34
00:02:00.866 --> 00:02:02.266
How many of us are there outside?

35
00:02:03.066 --> 00:02:04.166
100 people

36
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.433
If things go wrong

37
00:02:06.466 --> 00:02:09.233
Then kill it
