00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:04.400
Tongtong, are you alright?

2
00:00:04.766 --> 00:00:07.400
Sister, you are finally here.

3
00:00:10.166 --> 00:00:12.466
Kobayashi, stop it

4
00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:14.666
Dongying no longer exists

5
00:00:14.933 --> 00:00:16.600
If you turn yourself in now

6
00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.633
The police may be able to be lenient

7
00:00:18.733 --> 00:00:22.233
Okay, as long as you win, I'll turn myself in

8
00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:29.933
Do you remember when we were kids

9
00:00:29.933 --> 00:00:31.666
Do you often play this game?

10
00:00:31.666 --> 00:00:34.066
Whoever crosses the line first loses

11
00:00:34.733 --> 00:00:38.100
When you were young, you often lost to me

12
00:00:38.866 --> 00:00:40.500
Why am I bothering?

13
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:41.666
You know better than to be careful

14
00:00:41.666 --> 00:00:44.266
I know you lost to me on purpose.

15
00:00:44.266 --> 00:00:47.233
But today is not so easy

16
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:52.866
This trick

17
00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:54.366
It was dad

18
00:00:54.366 --> 00:00:56.600
The pose when competing with the remodeler

19
00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:58.700
How do you know?

20
00:00:58.933 --> 00:01:00.633
You were obviously not there

21
00:01:00.866 --> 00:01:01.700
Exactly.

22
00:01:02.566 --> 00:01:04.900
I already knew that my father played black boxing

23
00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.766
I knew all about his death

24
00:01:09.166 --> 00:01:11.900
I know my father died in that fight back then

25
00:01:12.166 --> 00:01:12.900
I also know

26
00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.200
You've been practicing this trick for ten years

27
00:01:34.066 --> 00:01:35.400
You know everything

28
00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.900
Why join Dongying?

29
00:01:37.266 --> 00:01:38.866
Work with them

30
00:01:39.533 --> 00:01:41.433
For revenge
