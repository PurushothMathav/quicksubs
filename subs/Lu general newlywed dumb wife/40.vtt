00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:03.633
How could you humiliate me like that when you invaded?

2
00:00:04.133 --> 00:00:05.200
Humiliate you

3
00:00:06.366 --> 00:00:08.300
How could I be willing to humiliate Lan Lan?

4
00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:10.900
This game is your idea

5
00:00:11.666 --> 00:00:14.033
Now I am no longer qualified to communicate.

6
00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.500
We have an emergency news story from late last night.

7
00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.566
A group of rich second-generation people gather to race

8
00:00:31.566 --> 00:00:33.700
A car spun out of control and drove into the crowd

9
00:00:33.733 --> 00:00:35.300
Cause one death and two injuries

10
00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.633
It is reported that the driver was a private daughter

11
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.066
The specific cause of the accident is under investigation

12
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.566
Hello, the phone you dialed is turned off.

13
00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.266
Hello, the phone you dialed is turned off.

14
00:00:59.666 --> 00:01:01.833
You'll find out soon enough.

15
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.800
I said you have to pay for disobedience

16
00:01:13.533 --> 00:01:14.333
Ash

17
00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.500
I heard the commander hit someone with his car

18
00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.866
Did you do this?

19
00:01:20.566 --> 00:01:21.633
Why do you ask?

20
00:01:21.733 --> 00:01:24.866
I heard that private stocks have fallen by the limit

21
00:01:24.866 --> 00:01:27.700
Who else but you has made such a big effort?

22
00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.366
Are you trying to help me vent my anger?

23
00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:31.466
What do you think?

24
00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.300
I knew you were the best for me

25
00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:36.900
Which Siniu used to bully me?

26
00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.300
Now you finally help me excrete my anger

27
00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.800
Jiang Wan, what are you doing here?

28
00:01:44.066 --> 00:01:45.566
Why Jiang Wan

29
00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.300
Are you trying to intercede with the commander?

30
00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:49.533
Let me tell you something.

31
00:01:49.533 --> 00:01:50.700
No door

32
00:01:52.333 --> 00:01:53.566
Did you hear it?

33
00:01:53.666 --> 00:01:55.100
He is letting you out

34
00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:56.833
I'm asking you to go out
