00:00:00.966 --> 00:00:01.766
Let him go!

2
00:00:02.966 --> 00:00:03.800
go down

3
00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:11.300
Mom business

4
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:14.133
Don't get angry with Jiangnan

5
00:00:14.133 --> 00:00:14.966
reserved

6
00:00:15.066 --> 00:00:17.866
I think you've been a little too greedy lately

7
00:00:17.866 --> 00:00:19.800
I use my experience to tell you

8
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:25.000
The most taboo thing about being a person is to want and want

9
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.166
Mom is right

10
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:32.266
I remember.

11
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.100
Don't move.

12
00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:43.500
Is what Mom said true? What?

13
00:00:44.733 --> 00:00:45.633
shares

14
00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:50.800
Mind your business in the mall

15
00:00:50.866 --> 00:00:51.800
So

16
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.900
You said before that you would sign a divorce with me in half a month.

17
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:55.700
agreement

18
00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:58.033
It's because the will won't take effect until half a month later

19
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.000
Right?

20
00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.033
You married me just to be lonely

21
00:01:08.366 --> 00:01:12.000
You've never liked me

22
00:01:12.666 --> 00:01:13.466
Yes.

23
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.133
Can't you just pretend you don't know anything?

24
00:01:17.133 --> 00:01:18.100
These years

25
00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.466
Am I not good enough for you?

26
00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.433
The two of us together

27
00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.266
Have been living together

28
00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:25.700
happy

29
00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.066
Isn't that good?

30
00:01:29.933 --> 00:01:33.066
Now you let me go

31
00:01:33.266 --> 00:01:35.666
You can let me go anywhere

32
00:01:35.933 --> 00:01:37.100
I beg you.

33
00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:38.066
Let You Go

34
00:01:38.866 --> 00:01:40.100
So many years

35
00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:42.866
Do you still want to leave me?
