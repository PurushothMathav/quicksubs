1
00:00:02.133 --> 00:00:03.633
Don't go

2
00:00:04.133 --> 00:00:05.800
Bring the documents you want tomorrow morning

3
00:00:05.933 --> 00:00:07.900
Bring it all back to me

4
00:00:09.266 --> 00:00:11.666
Vice President on the South Head of the Pearl River

5
00:00:11.666 --> 00:00:12.966
Don't mention those two words to me

6
00:00:13.866 --> 00:00:15.766
Ah what did I say

7
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.966
It should be fine in the middle of the night, right?

8
00:00:19.466 --> 00:00:20.866
And I missed being a thief

9
00:00:21.466 --> 00:00:22.266
Jiangnan

10
00:00:22.866 --> 00:00:23.900
Are you there?

11
00:00:31.933 --> 00:00:32.866
You can get another one in the future.

12
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.966
If you're there, knock on the door twice

13
00:00:36.766 --> 00:00:37.900
Are you OK?

14
00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:42.000
Gone. How are you?

15
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:43.466
Wait for me.

16
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:44.900
Wait a minute.

17
00:00:51.333 --> 00:00:52.166
How have you been?

18
00:00:52.333 --> 00:00:53.866
I'm going to the hospital first.

19
00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.166
A project developed in collaboration with the Rothgar people in the UK

20
00:01:01.166 --> 00:01:03.033
It has not passed the board vote yet.

21
00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:07.166
The main reason is because your mother voted for the law

22
00:01:10.733 --> 00:01:11.533
Do not go

23
00:01:16.166 --> 00:01:19.766
Let's just go home.
