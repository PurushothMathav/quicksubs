00:00:03.366 --> 00:00:04.166
Shenyang

2
00:00:05.466 --> 00:00:06.900
I beg you

3
00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:09.866
Give me back the capsule

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.266
I beg you

5
00:00:13.266 --> 00:00:16.466
In this life I can hear you give me the word ball

6
00:00:16.533 --> 00:00:17.400
It's worth it.

7
00:00:18.333 --> 00:00:20.166
As long as you are willing to give it back to me

8
00:00:20.766 --> 00:00:22.466
I will do whatever you ask me to do

9
00:00:22.466 --> 00:00:23.800
If I say

10
00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:26.600
I want your way

11
00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:30.300
Great deal bro

12
00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.433
Back then, in order to inherit your promise

13
00:00:39.966 --> 00:00:41.800
How much effort has been put into it

14
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.166
Finally put Wang Xueqin

15
00:00:44.166 --> 00:00:46.100
Mother and daughter were sent to prison

16
00:00:46.566 --> 00:00:48.666
If you say no now, you don't want it.

17
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.066
In my heart

18
00:00:51.566 --> 00:00:53.966
Nothing is more important than Jiangnan

19
00:00:54.933 --> 00:00:55.900
Never mind.

20
00:00:56.866 --> 00:00:59.466
I'm not some villain who takes advantage of others

21
00:01:01.066 --> 00:01:02.166
Me to Lan Lan

22
00:01:03.533 --> 00:01:05.066
Even hippie beggars

23
00:01:07.566 --> 00:01:08.766
He is willing to stay with you

24
00:01:10.566 --> 00:01:12.866
Just let him stay

25
00:01:17.066 --> 00:01:18.100
Forgot to tell you

26
00:01:19.466 --> 00:01:21.366
He and I didn't get a marriage license at all

27
00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.866
He had lost most of his discipline by then

28
00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.766
Does not belong to full capacity for civil conduct

29
00:01:26.766 --> 00:01:28.033
Can't get the certificate at all

30
00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:29.066
Then why did you

31
00:01:29.066 --> 00:01:30.500
Because he asked

32
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.833
Help him take care of his children after he's down

33
00:01:34.266 --> 00:01:35.300
I married him.

34
00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:36.566
Just to give that child

35
00:01:36.566 --> 00:01:38.066
A legitimate identity

36
00:01:38.766 --> 00:01:40.566
So you two are not at all

37
00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:43.366
Your own child

38
00:01:43.666 --> 00:01:44.800
Always let someone else find it

39
00:01:56.933 --> 00:01:58.766
1 second late at night

40
00:01:59.166 --> 00:02:00.666
Roll up Malatang

41
00:02:23.966 --> 00:02:24.900
How about Lan Lan?

42
00:02:26.366 --> 00:02:27.033
How do you like it?
