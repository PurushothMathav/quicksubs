00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:03.300
Hello

2
00:00:04.266 --> 00:00:05.100
What!

3
00:00:05.966 --> 00:00:08.300
OK, I see.

4
00:00:10.733 --> 00:00:12.566
Ah Wei, sorry.

5
00:00:12.566 --> 00:00:15.966
This contract cannot be signed for the time being, Manager Chen

6
00:00:16.066 --> 00:00:17.266
What's your situation?

7
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:18.166
This

8
00:00:19.266 --> 00:00:23.166
Mr. Gao, is this the person you said would wear copper?

9
00:00:25.166 --> 00:00:26.000
Yes, little lady.

10
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.700
Look at Zilong's candidate, since we have already decided

11
00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:31.300
Why don't you try this set of jade rings?

12
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:32.766
This style is more suitable for you.

13
00:00:32.766 --> 00:00:35.700
But I just want to take you first

14
00:00:35.733 --> 00:00:38.633
Shouldn't Manager Chen explain it to us?

15
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.400
This lady is the VIP of our store.

16
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.466
Or is Mr. Lu holding it at the top of his heart?

17
00:00:43.466 --> 00:00:45.766
This is a VIP.

18
00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.000
This Mr. Lu is really generous

19
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.933
If he were this big for his own wife

20
00:00:50.933 --> 00:00:51.700
The wind is fine.

21
00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:53.333
Siniang, what do you mean?

22
00:00:53.333 --> 00:00:54.900
Isn't it obvious enough?

23
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:58.000
This motherland was authentic in ancient times

24
00:00:58.733 --> 00:01:01.066
You are a nameless pheasant

25
00:01:01.733 --> 00:01:02.533
you

26
00:01:03.066 --> 00:01:04.966
Forget it, let's go back.

27
00:01:04.966 --> 00:01:06.300
What are you going back to?

28
00:01:06.333 --> 00:01:07.800
What are you afraid of him for?

29
00:01:08.133 --> 00:01:09.600
How much does he spend with you?

30
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.966
More than 2,000, I will give 30 million

31
00:01:11.966 --> 00:01:14.466
This copper is none other than Jiang Lan

32
00:01:14.766 --> 00:01:16.066
Su Ming calm down

33
00:01:16.066 --> 00:01:17.300
We're here to make money.

34
00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:18.700
Not to spend money

35
00:01:18.966 --> 00:01:22.100
Give people an excuse for the money, and you must transfer it back for you once.

36
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.633
30 million is better than at home

37
00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:27.066
How much did he pay?

38
00:01:27.066 --> 00:01:28.200
I pay double

39
00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.500
I want to live too

40
00:01:30.066 --> 00:01:31.800
It's like who has no money
