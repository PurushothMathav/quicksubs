00:00:00.733 --> 00:00:02.166
You think about it

2
00:00:02.166 --> 00:00:04.366
Then we will travel the world together

3
00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:08.066
The sky is high and the sea is wide, let the birds fly

4
00:00:09.533 --> 00:00:13.300
What a person with sky high and sea wide

5
00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:14.166
how

6
00:00:15.333 --> 00:00:16.500
Where do you want to fly?

7
00:00:16.533 --> 00:00:19.766
Come on. Where do you want to fly?

8
00:00:19.966 --> 00:00:21.466
This has nothing to do with you

9
00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.200
Legs on himself

10
00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:24.866
He can go wherever he wants

11
00:00:24.866 --> 00:00:26.733
He's not one of your pets.

12
00:00:26.733 --> 00:00:28.166
No need to complain to you

13
00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:33.533
If you tell me to get out, I will get out.

14
00:00:33.533 --> 00:00:34.633
I missed today.

15
00:00:48.666 --> 00:00:50.500
You seal my flowers in your ears, don't you?

16
00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.433
You still want to travel the world with him

17
00:00:52.866 --> 00:00:54.800
I have raised you for 20 years

18
00:00:54.866 --> 00:00:56.700
Are you still raising you?

19
00:01:02.066 --> 00:01:02.866
But

20
00:01:05.066 --> 00:01:07.766
He shouldn't have had a chance to take you away

21
00:01:10.733 --> 00:01:13.600
What are you going to do? You'll find out soon enough.

22
00:01:13.966 --> 00:01:17.800
I said you have to pay for disobedience

23
00:01:18.133 --> 00:01:19.000
I was wrong.

24
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.666
I will never mention divorce again, don't make it difficult for you

25
00:01:21.666 --> 00:01:24.466
Oops, Lan Lan is not in a hurry, Lan Lan is not in a hurry

26
00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.300
It seems that your relationship with Private is really good

27
00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.033
Personal affairs brother and sister are very kind to you, right?

28
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.200
Good enough to make you forget who you are

29
00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.000
No, no, oops.

30
00:01:39.933 --> 00:01:42.366
Ciyang booked this presidential suite for you

31
00:01:42.666 --> 00:01:44.300
Are you living comfortably?

32
00:01:49.866 --> 00:01:51.400
Did he stay overnight?

33
00:01:51.733 --> 00:01:52.966
I compare with him

34
00:01:53.366 --> 00:01:54.433
You are so particular
