00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:02.500
Xiaobai

2
00:00:02.766 --> 00:00:04.066
Are you serious?

3
00:00:06.266 --> 00:00:11.600
I know I will forget

4
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.000
Can't take care of him

5
00:00:14.333 --> 00:00:15.266
So

6
00:00:16.333 --> 00:00:21.400
I will give you all our property

7
00:00:23.533 --> 00:00:24.366
Here's the deal.

8
00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:27.766
Hello

9
00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:30.000
Which side is just the transaction?

10
00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:33.866
I promise you.

11
00:00:41.266 --> 00:00:43.500
Jiangnan, have you really thought about it?

12
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.366
The road is a 10% blessing

13
00:00:45.666 --> 00:00:48.200
If the market value exceeds 10 billion, you will give it to me.

14
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.633
It's useless for me to keep it

15
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.000
This is what I owe you to the private

16
00:01:05.566 --> 00:01:06.366
Open Sky Pool

17
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.466
Since you married me for these shares

18
00:01:09.733 --> 00:01:11.100
Then I'll give it to you.

19
00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.100
Is it your best friend?

20
00:01:18.766 --> 00:01:19.600
Vice President

21
00:01:19.666 --> 00:01:22.100
Recently, Lu's stock market has frequent trading records

22
00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:24.200
And the amount is huge

23
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.266
I suspect someone is making a stick out of it

24
00:01:26.666 --> 00:01:27.966
Do you want to check it out?

25
00:01:28.766 --> 00:01:30.600
Is there anything in the rich?

26
00:01:30.966 --> 00:01:33.433
Ah, not yet.

27
00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:35.166
It's called an apple.

28
00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.300
Lu Songlin Zheng

29
00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:39.633
What do you think?

30
00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.600
Is Lu Enterprises mine?

31
00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.366
Whatever the flood

32
00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.400
What does it have to do with me?
