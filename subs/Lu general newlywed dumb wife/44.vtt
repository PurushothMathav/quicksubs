1
00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:02.566
Don't eat anymore

2
00:00:02.933 --> 00:00:03.900
For what?

3
00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:06.900
We both have children too

4
00:00:09.066 --> 00:00:10.700
We should have a baby

5
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.300
Don't you find yourself lonely?

6
00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:16.033
Just give birth to a child to accompany you

7
00:00:16.133 --> 00:00:17.933
You don't have to go out and mess around in the future

8
00:00:17.933 --> 00:00:19.166
Bad social

9
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:20.466
So

10
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:23.266
Children are just tools for you to exercise control

11
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.633
You can't love him at all

12
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:28.100
I don't like kids.

13
00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:29.700
You're not obedient again, are you?

14
00:00:35.366 --> 00:00:36.300
What's up?

15
00:00:37.366 --> 00:00:40.500
Do you need me to take you to the hospital if you are not feeling well?

16
00:00:42.733 --> 00:00:43.533
Lan Lan

17
00:00:44.333 --> 00:00:46.233
Be nice.

18
00:01:05.133 --> 00:01:06.633
My child

19
00:01:29.566 --> 00:01:31.100
It was so chaotic yesterday.

20
00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:32.300
Didn't receive your call.

21
00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:33.433
Are you OK?

22
00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.433
I'm okay, how are you?

23
00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.166
How is Sining?

24
00:01:39.533 --> 00:01:40.466
Sorry.

25
00:01:40.966 --> 00:01:42.633
I implicated you

26
00:01:44.566 --> 00:01:45.533
It has nothing to do with you.

27
00:01:45.533 --> 00:01:48.266
Don't think too much about taking care of yourself and your baby.

28
00:01:48.333 --> 00:01:50.800
I'll contact you when this is over.
