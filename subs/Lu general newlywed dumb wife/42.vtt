00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:02.900
I warn you.

2
00:00:02.933 --> 00:00:04.333
Stay away from my boyfriend

3
00:00:04.333 --> 00:00:06.700
Summer, don't you know?

4
00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:08.033
Your Boyfriend

5
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.033
Is my legal husband

6
00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:11.300
So what if I was?

7
00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:12.966
He regards you as his wife

8
00:00:12.966 --> 00:00:14.200
He will marry you?

9
00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:15.900
It stimulates people.

10
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.166
For whatever reason

11
00:00:17.366 --> 00:00:19.133
Our relationship is legitimate

12
00:00:19.133 --> 00:00:21.666
I will tell you in the future.

13
00:00:21.666 --> 00:00:23.666
Sining stood out for you before

14
00:00:23.666 --> 00:00:25.566
Now there's jail time.

15
00:00:25.566 --> 00:00:28.200
He is implicated by you.

16
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:29.566
People like you

17
00:00:29.566 --> 00:00:30.933
I don't deserve someone else's girlfriend at all

18
00:00:30.933 --> 00:00:32.100
I don't deserve it.

19
00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.500
This is where you stand for my wife

20
00:00:41.266 --> 00:00:42.566
Private daughter Sining

21
00:00:42.566 --> 00:00:45.500
News of casualties in car accidents continues to ferment

22
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.200
The incident has caused private stocks to drop by the limit

23
00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.833
The death of private enterprises in previous years

24
00:00:51.133 --> 00:00:52.700
Even check private

25
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:54.166
It's all over.

26
00:00:54.166 --> 00:00:55.366
Industry like yours

27
00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.500
It doesn't care about our court at all

28
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:00.400
Marriage

29
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.200
Is it true that you don't deserve anyone?

30
00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:11.833
Did you know wrong?

31
00:01:14.666 --> 00:01:17.000
I know I'm wrong

32
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.766
I will never dare again

33
00:01:19.266 --> 00:01:21.066
Can you let it go in private?

34
00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.000
Please!

35
00:01:24.766 --> 00:01:26.166
How about your sincerity?

36
00:01:31.366 --> 00:01:32.400
Please!

37
00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.300
Is that your sincerity?

38
00:01:36.466 --> 00:01:37.400
future

39
00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:41.266
How much do you think your knees are worth?

40
00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:43.366
As long as you promise to let go

41
00:01:43.366 --> 00:01:44.166
will

42
00:01:44.466 --> 00:01:47.633
I can do anything you want me to ask you

43
00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.166
Sining and homesickness have a really good relationship with you

44
00:01:55.366 --> 00:01:58.533
Have you forgotten who gave you the drink and the clothes?

45
00:01:58.533 --> 00:02:00.433
Raised you to such a large mountain
