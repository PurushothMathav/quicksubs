1
00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:03.766
Have a good rest.

2
00:00:04.533 --> 00:00:05.333
good boy

3
00:00:07.766 --> 00:00:08.500
Mr. Wei

4
00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:11.000
This project with the Lawrence family

5
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.333
It's going very well.

6
00:00:12.333 --> 00:00:14.166
I had contact with your mother before

7
00:00:14.166 --> 00:00:15.800
People who have been opposing

8
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.433
Changed attitude now

9
00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.300
Meet people and serve dishes

10
00:00:19.733 --> 00:00:20.966
worship high and mine low

11
00:00:21.333 --> 00:00:22.566
It's human nature.

12
00:00:22.566 --> 00:00:23.366
Mr. Lu

13
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.633
Now you own the 10% equity blessing of your wife

14
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:27.600
You can say

15
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.466
You finally have the highest voice in the group

16
00:00:30.466 --> 00:00:33.433
But the shares are in the hands of the wife

17
00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:34.866
If divorced

18
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.366
The sorry word is that I can't sleep, remember.

19
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.900
I will not divorce Gangnam

20
00:00:42.533 --> 00:00:43.600
Anytime

21
00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.333
Grandpa is too biased

22
00:00:48.333 --> 00:00:50.200
He actually left shares for that mute

23
00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.300
And myopia caught us by surprise.

24
00:00:52.533 --> 00:00:54.266
Who is his biological granddaughter?

25
00:00:54.266 --> 00:00:56.700
The little wolf cub thinks he has grown up

26
00:00:56.733 --> 00:00:58.966
I can't help showing my fangs

27
00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.233
That's kind of bloody

28
00:01:02.666 --> 00:01:06.166
Mom, if that project is really made in the pool

29
00:01:06.166 --> 00:01:08.666
He's further out of our control

30
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.700
Don't worry, he won't become a saint.

31
00:01:14.366 --> 00:01:17.333
Hmph, it's a mess outside

32
00:01:17.333 --> 00:01:19.100
You would enjoy it

33
00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:22.933
Don't gesticulate in front of me

34
00:01:22.933 --> 00:01:24.433
Hurry up and sign

35
00:01:29.966 --> 00:01:32.366
Ok I will fulfill you

36
00:01:33.166 --> 00:01:35.766
You can't remember anything I say anyway

37
00:01:36.133 --> 00:01:37.866
Only believe what others say

38
00:01:49.333 --> 00:01:50.233
hadron

39
00:01:51.933 --> 00:01:54.700
Why is this divorce agreement with you?

40
00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:56.266
Why are you asking so much?

41
00:01:56.266 --> 00:01:57.366
Sign quickly

42
00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.166
I can't sign now

43
00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:00.700
You dead mute

44
00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.333
My son signed it.

45
00:02:02.333 --> 00:02:03.533
You still don't want to sign

46
00:02:03.533 --> 00:02:04.700
What do you mean?

47
00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:05.900
Will you sign or not?

48
00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.000
If you don't sign, don't blame me for being rude to you.

49
00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:11.600
I can get a divorce.

50
00:02:11.666 --> 00:02:13.300
But divorce is a matter of two people

51
00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.000
I can't sign without knowing it.

52
00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.966
Don't you sign?

53
00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.100
Ok ma

54
00:02:20.966 --> 00:02:22.766
Let me sign the certificate
