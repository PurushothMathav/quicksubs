00:00:01.066 --> 00:00:02.200
What do you mean?

2
00:00:02.566 --> 00:00:04.500
All the money you gave me is here.

3
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:05.600
I haven't used a cent.

4
00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:07.833
I'm not talking about the money I gave you.

5
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:08.866
It was land.

6
00:00:08.866 --> 00:00:11.800
All the money my family has spent on you over the years

7
00:00:12.366 --> 00:00:14.033
I can pay it back slowly

8
00:00:14.533 --> 00:00:15.666
You are dumb

9
00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:17.533
Can't even speak clearly

10
00:00:17.533 --> 00:00:19.300
You can only go out and starve to death

11
00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.500
Tell me what do you get back?

12
00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:24.700
We got divorced.

13
00:00:24.766 --> 00:00:26.700
You can take it down

14
00:00:26.866 --> 00:00:31.100
So you can be together forever

15
00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.500
When will you pay off the money?

16
00:00:38.266 --> 00:00:39.866
When will you bring up divorce again?

17
00:00:58.900 --> 00:00:59.866
But it doesn't matter.

18
00:00:59.866 --> 00:01:02.500
Anyway, I already know that Shizuka will marry me.

19
00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.133
Hey, Doraemon, since we're here, we're all here

20
00:01:05.133 --> 00:01:07.600
Then go see how I'm getting married tomorrow

21
00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:08.866
Yes.

22
00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.366
Ok will you marry me

23
00:01:18.133 --> 00:01:20.266
Married, married.

24
00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:21.600
knot

25
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.666
married

26
00:01:24.666 --> 00:01:25.466
married

27
00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.566
Married, married.

28
00:01:35.066 --> 00:01:37.766
Sister-in-law, come quickly. Brother Rubik's Cube is crazy.

29
00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.800
Xiaoning, don't go again

30
00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:44.266
Hitting people is your army

31
00:01:45.133 --> 00:01:47.300
Quickly apologize to Miss Xia in person

32
00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.300
It's over, bro

33
00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:53.833
He's just a pheasant cackling around.

34
00:01:53.866 --> 00:01:55.100
It's also worthy of me to talk to him

35
00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.600
It's you. Are you crazy?
