1
00:00:02.766 --> 00:00:03.566
roll

2
00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:10.500
What did the doctor say?

3
00:00:10.866 --> 00:00:14.366
Now you really care what the doctor says

4
00:00:14.366 --> 00:00:15.933
Do you care about my health?

5
00:00:15.933 --> 00:00:18.300
You're just trying to satisfy your desire for control

6
00:00:18.733 --> 00:00:20.433
As for what the answer is

7
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.200
You don't care at all

8
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.200
Turn your head around

9
00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:29.233
Look at me.

10
00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:32.233
I don't want to say it again.

11
00:00:34.566 --> 00:00:36.700
I cried and felt wronged.

12
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:38.700
Let's get a divorce.

13
00:00:40.566 --> 00:00:41.700
Can you say that again?

14
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.300
Let's get a divorce.

15
00:00:44.533 --> 00:00:45.600
Good idea.

16
00:00:46.266 --> 00:00:47.366
You get out

17
00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:50.733
Live outside for half a month and then come back

18
00:00:50.733 --> 00:00:53.433
I'll sign a marriage agreement with you, wait a minute

19
00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:55.600
Quit

20
00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:57.366
Pack up

21
00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.833
You eat all over

22
00:01:01.133 --> 00:01:04.233
I bought everything I wear and drink

23
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.633
Why did you take it away?

24
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.166
Enough go

25
00:01:12.866 --> 00:01:14.100
roll

26
00:01:26.733 --> 00:01:29.166
Now you give me half a month.

27
00:01:29.166 --> 00:01:30.666
What are you trying to prove?

28
00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.166
Prove that you can't live without me?

29
00:01:33.333 --> 00:01:34.200
Yes!

30
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.800
I've always been pinched by you

31
00:01:37.166 --> 00:01:39.800
How could I possibly escape from your grasp?
