00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:01.633
Do you remember when we were in school?

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.766
Are you fighting with the gangsters from the school next door?

3
00:00:04.766 --> 00:00:06.900
I carried it back, hello.

4
00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:08.600
Which school is the nearest?

5
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:10.700
Here comes a very cute little sister

6
00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:11.900
Very white

7
00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:13.100
That Xiaobai is very good.

8
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.433
Are you talking about that little mute?

9
00:00:15.566 --> 00:00:17.366
Yes, he does have it.

10
00:00:17.366 --> 00:00:19.100
But talk

11
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.233
Almost

12
00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.066
He can't speak

13
00:00:22.066 --> 00:00:24.466
But no matter what he does, he can't say it

14
00:00:24.466 --> 00:00:25.666
Pretty exciting.

15
00:00:25.666 --> 00:00:28.566
It hasn't changed, play with him

16
00:00:29.366 --> 00:00:30.166
What do you mean?

17
00:00:30.166 --> 00:00:31.100
I beg your pardon.

18
00:00:31.266 --> 00:00:33.600
Who cares who I am

19
00:00:33.733 --> 00:00:34.900
Shut my mouth

20
00:00:40.566 --> 00:00:42.466
Never say that to me again

21
00:00:42.466 --> 00:00:44.166
I hit you once I see you

22
00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:51.033
Go go go

23
00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:13.933
You said your rich boy

24
00:01:13.933 --> 00:01:15.700
With those gangsters?

25
00:01:15.733 --> 00:01:17.033
There are so many of them.

26
00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.200
Didn't you send it to your door to be beaten?

27
00:01:19.566 --> 00:01:21.366
They bully Xiaoya

28
00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:22.700
Huaihua by Xiaoya

29
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.100
Should hit

30
00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:26.966
That's not like you.

31
00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.266
I can't die.

32
00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.100
If I die

33
00:01:31.533 --> 00:01:33.200
The little girl must be bullied

34
00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:35.833
Are you coming to the hospital soon?

35
00:01:36.466 --> 00:01:38.100
Red dust cannot sleep

36
00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:39.600
Who?

37
00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.866
If I die

38
00:01:43.266 --> 00:01:44.100
you

39
00:01:45.166 --> 00:01:46.233
You must help

40
00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.433
Help me survive

41
00:01:55.366 --> 00:01:56.166
Lu Zongchi

42
00:01:58.533 --> 00:01:59.866
Over the years

43
00:02:01.366 --> 00:02:03.266
You protect your free run
