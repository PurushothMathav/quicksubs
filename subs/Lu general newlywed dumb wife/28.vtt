00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.000
That is

2
00:00:01.366 --> 00:00:03.400
Do you not love me at all?

3
00:00:04.866 --> 00:00:05.666
sweet

4
00:00:06.133 --> 00:00:07.600
The whole world knows

5
00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:09.266
You are my woman

6
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.400
You say I like you or not

7
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.833
But why won't you touch me?

8
00:00:15.366 --> 00:00:16.400
You know.

9
00:00:17.333 --> 00:00:18.600
Because I can't marry you

10
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:19.500
So

11
00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:21.866
You cherish me

12
00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.066
Right, Yanyan?

13
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.500
What do you think?

14
00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:28.100
Look at

15
00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:30.766
For the sake of you treating me so well

16
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.266
I don't care

17
00:00:32.266 --> 00:00:33.066
But

18
00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:34.966
You are still not allowed to accompany that mute today

19
00:00:34.966 --> 00:00:37.033
Don't go on your birthday

20
00:00:37.766 --> 00:00:39.866
Ok I promise you

21
00:00:39.966 --> 00:00:41.166
That's more like it.

22
00:00:54.933 --> 00:00:56.933
I said I don't like this style.

23
00:00:56.933 --> 00:00:58.133
He insisted on buying it.

24
00:00:58.133 --> 00:00:59.466
I really can't do anything about him

25
00:01:17.866 --> 00:01:19.933
I said I don't like this style.

26
00:01:19.933 --> 00:01:21.100
He insisted on buying it.

27
00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:22.600
It's so bold

28
00:01:29.666 --> 00:01:31.900
Sorry, we're closing.

29
00:01:33.866 --> 00:01:37.000
This is the cake that Mr. Lu deposited in the store before

30
00:01:37.166 --> 00:01:38.766
It's about to hang up at 12 o'clock.

31
00:01:38.766 --> 00:01:40.666
Why don't you make a wish and go again?

32
00:01:48.866 --> 00:01:49.800
Happy Birthday

33
00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.033
Happy Birthday

34
00:01:51.566 --> 00:01:52.866
Happy Birthday
