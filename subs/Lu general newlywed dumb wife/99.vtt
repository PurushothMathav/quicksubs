00:00:03.933 --> 00:00:06.300
Do you remember what day it is today?

3
00:00:07.933 --> 00:00:09.266
What day is it?

4
00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:11.700
Today is the day we remarry

5
00:00:12.066 --> 00:00:15.266
Little idiot just told you this morning

6
00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:19.400

7
00:00:20.066 --> 00:00:21.266
Married to you?

8
00:00:21.266 --> 00:00:22.166

9
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.100
Don't you want to?

10
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:26.766
You really don't want to

11
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:28.600
Hey me

12
00:00:29.366 --> 00:00:32.433
I shake my head not to say I don't want to

13
00:00:32.466 --> 00:00:33.566
I nod.

14
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.833
It's not to answer your second question.

15
00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:37.966
But to answer your first question

16
00:00:38.933 --> 00:00:40.433
What I'm saying is

17
00:00:40.766 --> 00:00:42.066
I would.

18
00:00:42.766 --> 00:00:44.900
I will not marry anyone except my brother

19
00:00:46.966 --> 00:00:47.766
Jiangnan

20
00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:49.400
This world

21
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.433
Only you can give me unconditional love

22
00:00:52.466 --> 00:00:54.200
Even if you forget everything

23
00:00:54.266 --> 00:00:56.366
I even forgot who I was

24
00:00:56.366 --> 00:00:59.000
But I have never forgotten to love this thing

25
00:00:59.366 --> 00:01:00.166
blue

26
00:01:00.733 --> 00:01:01.566
come

27
00:01:09.066 --> 00:01:10.866
Lan Lan, look

28
00:01:11.666 --> 00:01:14.133
This photo is when you first arrived at the Lu's house.

29
00:01:14.133 --> 00:01:16.266
You eat like a kitten

30
00:01:16.366 --> 00:01:19.433
This is a few of us moving

31
00:01:20.466 --> 00:01:22.766
I will be the groom

32
00:01:22.866 --> 00:01:25.500
How about you as a bride

33
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:26.800
You know what?

34
00:01:27.866 --> 00:01:29.600
You would have married me long ago

35
00:01:30.066 --> 00:01:31.800
This was when we were in college

36
00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:34.366
I know you have something on your mind

37
00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.300
But I can't show it

38
00:01:37.766 --> 00:01:39.366
Because of me at that time

39
00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:42.366
There is no ability to protect you at all

40
00:01:42.766 --> 00:01:45.366
Brother, the college entrance examination is finally over.

41
00:01:45.366 --> 00:01:48.600
Can I ask you to be reserved in the future?

42
00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.366
No longer a brother

43
00:01:54.566 --> 00:01:56.700
Lan Lan introduces to you

44
00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.100
This is my girlfriend. Do you know her, Ying?

45
00:02:00.866 --> 00:02:01.800
Look at sister-in-law

46
00:02:03.466 --> 00:02:05.033
sister-in-law

47
00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:18.266
Here it is.
