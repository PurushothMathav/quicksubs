00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:01.900
Who did you show this innocent look to?

2
00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:02.733
I'll tell you what.

3
00:00:02.733 --> 00:00:04.533
Here's me and 20 homes now.

4
00:00:04.533 --> 00:00:05.900
Get out of here

5
00:00:09.066 --> 00:00:10.166
Hello Mr. Lu

6
00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:12.200
Miss Xia, why are you at Yujiangting?

7
00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:13.766
You met Xia Yan?

8
00:00:13.766 --> 00:00:14.933
What are you doing in Yujiangting?

9
00:00:14.933 --> 00:00:16.433
It's not me, it's Taiping.

10
00:00:16.666 --> 00:00:17.766
It's Miss Jiang

11
00:00:17.766 --> 00:00:19.166
I met him in the street

12
00:00:19.166 --> 00:00:20.666
He asked me to send him back to Yujiangting

13
00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:22.466
Why is Miss Xia here?

14
00:00:22.566 --> 00:00:23.633
I'll be right there.

15
00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:25.700
I am not divorced from Modesty

16
00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:27.566
This is my lover leaving

17
00:00:28.133 --> 00:00:28.933
Jiangnan

18
00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.900
Why didn't I notice you were so thick-skinned before?

19
00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:33.133
You and Shih are divorced

20
00:00:33.133 --> 00:00:34.533
What are you still pestering him for?

21
00:00:34.533 --> 00:00:37.166
Why can't you get along outside?

22
00:00:37.166 --> 00:00:39.166
So do you want to come back shamelessly?

23
00:00:39.166 --> 00:00:40.266
You are talking nonsense.

24
00:00:40.266 --> 00:00:42.100
Will I not know if I am divorced?

25
00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:43.566
Still want to deny it, right?

26
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:48.866
Divorce certificate counts

27
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:50.700
What else do you have to say?

28
00:01:03.366 --> 00:01:04.366
Get out of here

29
00:01:04.366 --> 00:01:06.466
Other mixed things open your mouth

30
00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.600
Chi, your ex-wife is too shameless.

31
00:01:16.666 --> 00:01:18.500
I divorced you and still pester you

32
00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.900
You hurry up and get rid of him I don't want to see him

33
00:01:21.166 --> 00:01:22.800
Is this where you came from?

34
00:01:22.933 --> 00:01:23.733
Xiaolian

35
00:01:24.066 --> 00:01:27.633
Don't be angry. I'll handle this.

36
00:01:29.666 --> 00:01:30.633
Let's go

37
00:01:34.066 --> 00:01:35.400
I got divorced because

38
00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:58.200
Does it hurt?

39
00:01:58.866 --> 00:02:01.633
Did I do something wrong by entering the country late?

40
00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:03.900
Pardon me?

41
00:02:04.666 --> 00:02:06.966
Then why don't you want me?

42
00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:09.900
Who gave you the courage to say this?
