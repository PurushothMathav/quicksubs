00:00:00.566 --> 00:00:01.866
No one cares about me

2
00:00:03.166 --> 00:00:04.633
Then they fired me.

3
00:00:06.533 --> 00:00:07.333
tired

4
00:00:08.166 --> 00:00:10.200
I don't want to be the president anymore

5
00:00:11.133 --> 00:00:11.933
Mr. Lu

6
00:00:12.566 --> 00:00:14.633
Do you really want to die and give up at this time?

7
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:20.300
Zhang

8
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:22.066
What a king

9
00:00:26.066 --> 00:00:27.066
I used to

10
00:00:27.766 --> 00:00:29.033
Have a candy

11
00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:33.200
A fragrant one

12
00:00:34.133 --> 00:00:35.433
Sweet candy

13
00:00:39.266 --> 00:00:40.433
reluctant to eat

14
00:00:42.133 --> 00:00:43.833
I'm afraid of being known by others

15
00:00:44.066 --> 00:00:45.600
You said I hid it

16
00:00:45.766 --> 00:00:47.400
I hide and hide

17
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.066
Hide it tightly

18
00:00:52.333 --> 00:00:53.366
What gossip?

19
00:00:55.666 --> 00:00:57.266
I'm moldy

20
00:00:59.733 --> 00:01:01.666
What else is there that doesn't grow eyes?

21
00:01:01.966 --> 00:01:02.766
fly

22
00:01:03.333 --> 00:01:04.200
ant

23
00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:07.000
meddled

24
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.466
And then what?

25
00:01:15.266 --> 00:01:16.833
Throw it away

26
00:01:18.566 --> 00:01:19.966
No.

27
00:01:23.533 --> 00:01:24.500
Without me

28
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.300
No.

29
00:01:27.333 --> 00:01:28.700
I have nothing.

30
00:01:49.466 --> 00:01:50.533
Come and have breakfast!

31
00:01:50.533 --> 00:01:52.833
Who are you, brother?

32
00:01:53.966 --> 00:01:54.766
Nan Nan

33
00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.700
How many days did you remember me?

34
00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:59.866
I can't remember a day now.

35
00:02:01.466 --> 00:02:03.100
I want to find my brother

36
00:02:04.133 --> 00:02:04.933
Lan Lan

37
00:02:05.566 --> 00:02:07.400
You are my wife now

38
00:02:07.566 --> 00:02:09.300
You and I are family

39
00:02:09.566 --> 00:02:11.000
You want to live with me

40
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.433
I can't find my brother anymore

41
00:02:13.733 --> 00:02:18.100
Does my brother not want me?

42
00:02:21.666 --> 00:02:22.900
Have breakfast first

43
00:02:23.566 --> 00:02:25.466
Eating breakfast gives you energy

44
00:02:36.166 --> 00:02:36.966
Lan Lan

45
00:02:37.533 --> 00:02:40.766
I hope the person who can always be remembered by you

46
00:02:40.966 --> 00:02:42.066
Me.
