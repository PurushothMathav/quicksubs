00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:04.000
Lan Lan

2
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:10.100
I said I didn't lie to you.

3
00:00:10.933 --> 00:00:12.033
Do you believe it?

4
00:00:17.366 --> 00:00:19.433
Aren't you already able to speak?

5
00:00:19.733 --> 00:00:21.033
Why don't you speak?

6
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:33.400
You know.

7
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.500
That's not what I want to hear.

8
00:00:36.466 --> 00:00:39.366
Now we have nothing to do with each other.

9
00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:40.500
I don't want to see you again.

10
00:00:40.766 --> 00:00:41.966
Either you go

11
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.566
No, your last kiss

12
00:01:06.066 --> 00:01:07.733
Jiangnan jumped off a building to seek death without compensation

13
00:01:07.733 --> 00:01:10.000
Rescued by an alien mute

14
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.600
Dead or living disease

15
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.433
The important thing is that Konoike has shown his cards

16
00:01:14.466 --> 00:01:16.666
I didn't expect him to care so much about that mute

17
00:01:16.933 --> 00:01:18.966
What aesthetics does the young master of the Lu family have?

18
00:01:18.966 --> 00:01:21.166
How's the arrangement I asked you to arrange?

19
00:01:21.166 --> 00:01:22.900
It has been arranged.

20
00:01:23.066 --> 00:01:26.433
I'd like to see him take over the years of recording

21
00:01:26.566 --> 00:01:27.633
What are you capable of?
