00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.066
Does that mean reserved?

2
00:00:09.066 --> 00:00:10.233
Does it even need to be asked?

3
00:00:10.266 --> 00:00:12.066
He didn't even hum

4
00:00:12.066 --> 00:00:12.966
As you can imagine

5
00:00:12.966 --> 00:00:15.200
How much he hates the baby in your belly

6
00:00:17.866 --> 00:00:18.700
maybe

7
00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.433
I'm so disappointed after all

8
00:00:29.733 --> 00:00:31.900
Ah, my son is back.

9
00:00:32.766 --> 00:00:34.033
You are here too

10
00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.366
Stop standing and sit

11
00:00:42.333 --> 00:00:46.166
In the future, you and Jin Shi have been married for 3 years

12
00:00:46.166 --> 00:00:48.366
When are you going to have another baby with him?

13
00:00:48.766 --> 00:00:49.800
No, I'm not.

14
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:50.700
It's you adu

15
00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:52.800
You can't lift any pot without opening it.

16
00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:54.533
The Lu family already has a mute

17
00:00:54.533 --> 00:00:57.100
Do you want to have another little mute when you are sick again?

18
00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.100
Do we still want to meet people in the Lu family?

19
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.733
Don't I feel sorry for my brother?

20
00:01:00.733 --> 00:01:02.466
You can't stay with this mute forever

21
00:01:02.466 --> 00:01:03.800
Don't have children

22
00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.833
Isn't this going to make our Lu family irreplaceable?

23
00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:10.833
I put the gift here.

24
00:01:10.933 --> 00:01:13.000
I'm leaving first

25
00:01:13.066 --> 00:01:14.433
Don't worry. Let's go!

26
00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:15.766
Anyone else hasn't come yet

27
00:01:15.766 --> 00:01:17.600
Why don't you eat before leaving?

28
00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:22.033
Mom has something to do at the company, I'll go first, you can eat

29
00:01:22.333 --> 00:01:23.666
Zhang Lan walks

30
00:01:29.466 --> 00:01:31.166
What Lu Wanrou said just now

31
00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:32.633
What do you think?

32
00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.200
What? Have a baby?

33
00:01:37.133 --> 00:01:38.433
Mom is right

34
00:01:39.066 --> 00:01:41.166
Let's not be born again

35
00:01:45.933 --> 00:01:46.766
Last night?

36
00:01:47.666 --> 00:01:48.933
I didn't do anything wrong.

37
00:01:48.933 --> 00:01:50.300
I took my medicine.
