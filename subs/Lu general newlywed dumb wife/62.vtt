00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:04.966
OK

2
00:00:05.766 --> 00:00:07.800
Now that you've made your decision

3
00:00:08.133 --> 00:00:10.766
Then I respect and bless your choice.

4
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:18.200
Xianglang

5
00:00:18.533 --> 00:00:22.266
I didn't expect you to have such close personal contact with Siying

6
00:00:22.566 --> 00:00:25.633
Then you should have been in Mrs. Lu's position

7
00:00:29.733 --> 00:00:32.900
Master, guess who I just saw outside

8
00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:33.700
I don't know.

9
00:00:33.733 --> 00:00:36.566
It's Jiangnan. He's with Siyang

10
00:00:36.566 --> 00:00:39.100
It's so sweet when the two of them talk and laugh

11
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.266
Who are you talking about Jiangnan and Siyang?

12
00:00:42.966 --> 00:00:44.500
I have a photo as proof.

13
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.233
I didn't wrong him.

14
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.600
Chi, you and Gangnam

15
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.966
It must be a real divorce

16
00:00:51.966 --> 00:00:54.300
Otherwise, he wouldn't have gone to Si Yao

17
00:00:54.366 --> 00:00:57.700
They can't have done something before, can they?

18
00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:59.300
If that's the case

19
00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.166
Then this mute is awesome

20
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.366
Hey, Chi, where are you going?

21
00:01:18.933 --> 00:01:22.700
Where did you go? I went out for a walk. I went for a walk.

22
00:01:24.066 --> 00:01:25.066
With who?

23
00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:26.900
Xiaobai

24
00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.833
What I told you

25
00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.200
You can't remember a sentence, can you?

26
00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.000
Jiangnan

27
00:01:33.333 --> 00:01:34.700
Not divorced yet

28
00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.233
You can't wait to find a home

29
00:01:37.866 --> 00:01:39.566
Siyang is nice to you, right?

30
00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.666
They are making up for it now. It is difficult for us to cross the river and protect ourselves

31
00:01:42.666 --> 00:01:44.200
Can he support you?

32
00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:46.966
I really miss him sometimes

33
00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.033
When to get a divorce certificate?

34
00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:57.766
divorce

35
00:01:58.466 --> 00:01:59.966
divorce divorce

36
00:02:00.166 --> 00:02:02.233
You know about divorce today, right?

37
00:02:03.466 --> 00:02:06.433
Now I know you can't keep your word

38
00:02:12.566 --> 00:02:15.300
I cooperate again and again
