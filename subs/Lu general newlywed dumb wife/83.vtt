00:00:00.666 --> 00:00:05.033
Let me tell you, today this lamp will be changed to Tibetan.

2
00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:06.766
some people

3
00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.266
You also experience

4
00:00:09.266 --> 00:00:11.800
Someone you care about gets hurt in front of you

5
00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.966
And you can only look at me helplessly

6
00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:16.233
Feel it

7
00:00:17.066 --> 00:00:19.166
A knife hangs over his head at all times

8
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.600
But there's nothing you can do

9
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.866
Lu Dingtian, what do you want to do?

10
00:00:24.866 --> 00:00:26.233
What do I do?

11
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:28.066
Can't you see?

12
00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:29.600
I've had enough

13
00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:32.366
I won't play with you if the table is turned over.

14
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.133
Remember to enter the country

15
00:00:36.133 --> 00:00:36.933
Without me

16
00:00:36.933 --> 00:00:39.300
You can't be the president of Lu Enterprises Group

17
00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:40.366
Dad Dong

18
00:00:40.366 --> 00:00:42.900
What did your grandfather ask you to do before he died?

19
00:00:42.933 --> 00:00:44.766
He asked you to take care of Lu Enterprises

20
00:00:45.366 --> 00:00:46.466
He loves you so much

21
00:00:46.466 --> 00:00:48.900
Do you want to ruin his efforts?

22
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.200
I before

23
00:00:52.133 --> 00:00:53.800
It's stepping into space.

24
00:00:54.966 --> 00:00:56.066
Too many cups

25
00:00:56.866 --> 00:00:58.633
But I've got it figured out now.

26
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.166
What's going on?

27
00:01:00.333 --> 00:01:01.866
What responsibility?

28
00:01:02.666 --> 00:01:04.033
So bullshit

29
00:01:04.766 --> 00:01:05.700
tired

30
00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:07.466
So tired

31
00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:10.466
Police uncle

32
00:01:11.366 --> 00:01:12.500
There are bad people

33
00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.566
ACHOO ACHOO Don't ACHOO

34
00:01:15.166 --> 00:01:17.066
ACHOO, can't you bite?

35
00:01:17.133 --> 00:01:19.166
You are involved in a multi-year broadcast injury

36
00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.400
The former wants to continue to prove

37
00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:22.500
Please cooperate with our investigation.

38
00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:23.566
If heat is prohibited

39
00:01:23.666 --> 00:01:25.166
Please let go of the hostage in your hands

40
00:01:25.166 --> 00:01:27.866
Otherwise, we will also deal with you according to law.

41
00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.000
Don't worry, uncle police.

42
00:01:35.366 --> 00:01:38.433
I won't be hurt by this scum

43
00:01:39.666 --> 00:01:40.466
grab

44
00:01:41.766 --> 00:01:42.900
Then break up

45
00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:54.100
do it all over again
