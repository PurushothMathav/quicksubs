00:00:00.466 --> 00:00:02.000
Just a little bug

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.233
You are busy with work

3
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.433
Why bother you with this trivial matter?

4
00:00:05.533 --> 00:00:06.900
If it doesn't go well tomorrow

5
00:00:07.533 --> 00:00:08.566
I'll take you to the hospital.

6
00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:11.866
Are you sure it's a gastrointestinal problem in the future?

7
00:00:11.933 --> 00:00:13.800
When I was pregnant

8
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.633
You too.

9
00:00:15.666 --> 00:00:17.366
Are you pregnant?

10
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:18.333
No no

11
00:00:18.333 --> 00:00:19.666
I'm not pregnant.

12
00:00:19.733 --> 00:00:21.900
It's just that the stomach is a little uncomfortable.

13
00:00:22.733 --> 00:00:25.000
Haha, it's good if you're not pregnant.

14
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.900
Save the pregnancy and have to take medicine

15
00:00:26.966 --> 00:00:29.833
What a hassle. That's right

16
00:00:32.933 --> 00:00:33.400
various roads

17
00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.900
No one welcomed or liked my child

18
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.033
I must never let them know of the existence of the child

19
00:00:50.166 --> 00:00:51.500
You are really pregnant

20
00:00:51.666 --> 00:00:54.266
No, you know.

21
00:00:54.266 --> 00:00:55.600
I take medicine every time

22
00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.700
You better be telling the truth

23
00:00:58.466 --> 00:01:01.066
If you find out that you are lying to me

24
00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:08.700
He's home.

25
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:11.633
What's up?

26
00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.200
The current bleeding situation has stabilized for the time being

27
00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.166
But your child is fragile.

28
00:01:16.166 --> 00:01:18.066
Before this child is born

29
00:01:18.166 --> 00:01:20.300
You don't have any marital commitments

30
00:01:20.333 --> 00:01:21.566
Next time

31
00:01:21.566 --> 00:01:22.800
You must stand

32
00:01:23.466 --> 00:01:26.233
I want to live in the old house for a few days

33
00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:28.700
Why is that?

34
00:01:29.566 --> 00:01:31.666
It's so busy here

35
00:01:31.666 --> 00:01:33.666
I also want to change my mood.

36
00:01:33.766 --> 00:01:35.000
You think about it

37
00:01:37.266 --> 00:01:39.500
OK, well, a few days, then.

38
00:01:39.533 --> 00:01:40.866
I'll pick you up in a few days.

39
00:01:44.666 --> 00:01:45.766
What happened again?
