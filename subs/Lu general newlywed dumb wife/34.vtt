00:00:11.266 --> 00:00:14.366
You won't end up in that homeless man's place

2
00:00:21.066 --> 00:00:24.100
Mrs. Lu has no money on her now, so she has no worries

3
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.566
Can't go anywhere

4
00:00:25.666 --> 00:00:26.800
Take him back

5
00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.066
No.

6
00:00:28.733 --> 00:00:30.700
Wait until he's done suffering outside

7
00:00:30.966 --> 00:00:32.666
He will understand

8
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.066
You're awake

9
00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.766
Why am I in the hospital?

10
00:00:56.466 --> 00:00:58.000
Can you speak?

11
00:00:58.066 --> 00:00:59.666
And can you write?

12
00:01:07.133 --> 00:01:09.100
Doctor, why am I in the hospital?

13
00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.133
You were taken by a cleaner in an underground passage

14
00:01:11.133 --> 00:01:13.666
I found it, and you also mixed blood at that time

15
00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.100
I thought there was a murder

16
00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:16.266
I quickly called the police

17
00:01:16.266 --> 00:01:18.266
It was the police comrade who brought you to the hospital

18
00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:21.066
You're better off now
