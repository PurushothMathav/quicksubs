00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:03.866
Chi, wait for me

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Let me explain.

3
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.300
I was scared to say anything

4
00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:09.333
I didn't really want Guerlain to die

5
00:00:09.333 --> 00:00:11.500
Know what kind of person I am

6
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:13.666
Mr. Lu heard that your wife

7
00:00:13.666 --> 00:00:15.366
She was kidnapped at the same time as a young lady named Xia Yan

8
00:00:15.366 --> 00:00:16.466
You chose to save Xia Yan

9
00:00:16.466 --> 00:00:18.000
Is this true?

10
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.900
Excuse me, Mr. Lu, is this photo real?

11
00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:21.200
Mr. Lu, why didn't you save your wife?

12
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:22.166
Did you cheat on Xia Yan?

13
00:00:22.166 --> 00:00:23.666
Are you that Miss Xia?

14
00:00:23.666 --> 00:00:25.466
Can you tell me what happened at that time?

15
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:26.700
Are you a mistress?

16
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:27.666
Are you aware of this behavior?

17
00:00:27.666 --> 00:00:28.800
Is destroying other people's families

18
00:00:29.666 --> 00:00:30.666
Your walnuts don't have many problems.

19
00:00:30.966 --> 00:00:33.566
Hello Mr. Lu, I ask you to answer Mr. Lu

20
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.966
The behavior of Lu Jinchi, president of Lu Group

21
00:00:37.966 --> 00:00:40.600
Has seriously challenged the public's moral bottom line

22
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:41.666
After the incident broke out

23
00:00:41.666 --> 00:00:43.466
The shares of Lu Group fell sharply

24
00:00:43.566 --> 00:00:45.166
But so far

25
00:00:45.166 --> 00:00:47.066
Lu Group Official Lu Caizi

26
00:00:47.366 --> 00:00:49.200
The results of your stress report are out

27
00:00:49.333 --> 00:00:50.600
Don't call me Mrs. Lu

28
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.700
I have divorced Lu Qiaji

29
00:00:53.933 --> 00:00:55.100
Sorry, Miss Zhang.

30
00:00:58.466 --> 00:01:02.233
Hey, kid, you're alright, don't worry.

31
00:01:02.533 --> 00:01:03.500
Others have children

32
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.366
Doctors who have miscarried should report for protection

33
00:01:05.666 --> 00:01:08.200
The adult situation is not urgent at all, and he wants to keep it big.

34
00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:11.366
Pardon me?

35
00:01:11.366 --> 00:01:13.066
Save my child

36
00:01:13.166 --> 00:01:15.500
Gotta keep him

37
00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:18.400
But

38
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.500
If my child dies

39
00:01:22.733 --> 00:01:24.833
I don't want to live anymore.

40
00:01:25.933 --> 00:01:27.166
Ok let's try our best

41
00:01:27.166 --> 00:01:28.266
Must never give up

42
00:01:28.266 --> 00:01:29.666
There must be hope by your side

43
00:01:29.666 --> 00:01:31.000
Come on.

44
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.066
Don't tell anyone about my pregnancy

45
00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.400
in particular

46
00:01:36.933 --> 00:01:38.600
Is the way

47
00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.466
Are you sure you want to hide your pregnancy?

48
00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:46.766
Can't tell him.

49
00:01:46.933 --> 00:01:49.500
Please save my life
