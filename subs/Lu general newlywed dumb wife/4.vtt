00:00:03.366 --> 00:00:05.266
Tell me where you're going.

3
00:00:05.266 --> 00:00:07.066
I should go to work.

Lan Lan will live in our house from now on

7
00:00:20.933 --> 00:00:23.000
This brother in the future?

8
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.100
Take good care of your sister.

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:29.500
I will have a sister in the future. Sister

10
00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:30.266

Brother will treat you well all his life

12
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:38.100
Sure enough, the oath was issued to be violated

13
00:00:42.266 --> 00:00:43.866
Arrived at Achi

14
00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.033
You really are with this mute

15
00:00:52.133 --> 00:00:54.433
You really are with this mute

16
00:00:54.466 --> 00:00:55.533
What are you doing here?

17
00:00:55.533 --> 00:00:58.166
How can I find you if I'm not here?

18
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.300
Get off and go to work

19
00:01:02.166 --> 00:01:03.233
Get in the car and say

20
00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.366
What are you doing?

21
00:01:12.366 --> 00:01:14.700
If it's dirty, I'll disinfect it.

22
00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:20.566
Are you still mad at me?

23
00:01:20.566 --> 00:01:23.400
Okay, don't be so stinky

24
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.300
big deal

25
00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:26.700
I won't mention your divorce from him in the future

26
00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:27.500
sir

27
00:01:27.933 --> 00:01:30.766
I told you to come with me for a day

28
00:01:30.766 --> 00:01:32.933
I'll keep you worry-free for a day

29
00:01:32.933 --> 00:01:34.800
If you never get married

30
00:01:35.166 --> 00:01:36.766
Then I will support you for the rest of my life

31
00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.200
But I'm obviously with you now

32
00:01:44.133 --> 00:01:48.300
Well, then you have to give me some compensation

33
00:01:48.533 --> 00:01:50.566
Tell me what you want.
