00:00:01.266 --> 00:00:02.566
How is my child?

2
00:00:02.566 --> 00:00:03.966
Is he still there?

3
00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:07.666
The child is still there

4
00:00:07.766 --> 00:00:10.200
But it's not going well.

5
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.833
Your fetus is weak

6
00:00:12.133 --> 00:00:15.500
It has already appeared, and I want to find it in the flow.

7
00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.333
Even if it is saved this time

8
00:00:17.333 --> 00:00:19.466
It may still be suddenly smooth next time.

9
00:00:22.333 --> 00:00:24.466
Is there any way to save him?

10
00:00:24.466 --> 00:00:26.266
From a professional standpoint

11
00:00:26.266 --> 00:00:29.266
My advice is to throw it away as soon as possible

12
00:00:29.566 --> 00:00:31.700
Good for you and the baby

13
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.400
Since you were found in the underpass

14
00:00:35.466 --> 00:00:38.333
Presumably you don't have a good economic condition

15
00:00:38.333 --> 00:00:40.200
There is no stable living environment

16
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.100
unless

17
00:00:41.166 --> 00:00:43.933
You can find a good fetal environment right away

18
00:00:43.933 --> 00:00:45.166
Get enough nutrients

19
00:00:45.166 --> 00:00:46.633
Maintain a stable mood

20
00:00:46.666 --> 00:00:47.566
otherwise

21
00:00:47.766 --> 00:00:50.400
Sooner or later your child will be thrown away by himself

22
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.833
You will suffer even more then

23
00:00:58.366 --> 00:01:00.000
I want to keep him.

24
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.800
Little girl, don't be stubborn

25
00:01:01.966 --> 00:01:04.133
If you have to feed this fetus

26
00:01:04.133 --> 00:01:06.366
You need a lot of energy and financial resources

27
00:01:06.533 --> 00:01:08.033
Do you have any money?

28
00:01:11.966 --> 00:01:14.233
Thanks doctor I know

29
00:01:21.933 --> 00:01:24.000
If you insist on having this fetus

30
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.266
You need a lot of experience and financial resources

31
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.066
Do you have any money?

32
00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:36.700
future

33
00:01:38.566 --> 00:01:39.366
go to the toilet
