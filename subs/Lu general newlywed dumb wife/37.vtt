00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.733
This card has 1 million

2
00:00:03.733 --> 00:00:05.833
If it's not enough, I'll contact you anytime.

3
00:00:07.766 --> 00:00:10.000
1 million too much

4
00:00:10.566 --> 00:00:12.933
Thank you. I'll pay you back.

5
00:00:12.933 --> 00:00:13.833
Yeah.

6
00:00:14.966 --> 00:00:18.433
By the way, do you have my phone number? No

7
00:00:26.533 --> 00:00:27.833
This is my personal microphone

8
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.100
I had someone buy a phone just for you.

9
00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:31.500
Feel free to contact me if you have anything.

10
00:00:32.566 --> 00:00:34.700
Thanks, I'll go first

11
00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:35.500
You pay attention to safety

12
00:00:41.133 --> 00:00:43.033
Baby, don't be afraid.

13
00:00:43.166 --> 00:00:45.466
Mom will do her best to protect you

14
00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:51.900
About Lu

15
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:54.466
It's the third time working with the Lawrence family

16
00:00:54.466 --> 00:00:55.100
General Assembly

17
00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:56.266
Poll display

18
00:00:56.266 --> 00:00:58.466
On the 18th, there were 20 votes against

19
00:00:58.666 --> 00:01:00.500
This resolution is different

20
00:01:10.066 --> 00:01:10.966
Be reserved.

21
00:01:10.966 --> 00:01:13.700
Actually, that was never very good for the project.

22
00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:14.966
Don't bother

23
00:01:14.966 --> 00:01:17.000
Besides, right now we are all

24
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.600
There is no shortage of this profit

25
00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:19.766
Yeah reserved

26
00:01:19.933 --> 00:01:21.800
This project is too risky

27
00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.833
Mom and I don't think it's necessary

28
00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:25.300
OK

29
00:01:25.866 --> 00:01:27.900
I listen to my mother's reconciliation and don't toss

30
00:01:29.166 --> 00:01:32.633
Today we all go back to the old house for a family meal

31
00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.766
Oops, I have another meeting in a while.

32
00:01:35.766 --> 00:01:36.800
You can eat.

33
00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.033
There's just something else.

34
00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.100
Brother Li, let's go

35
00:01:41.733 --> 00:01:42.600
Here we go.

36
00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.366
Mr. Lu, it's nothing

37
00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.200
As expected

38
00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:52.666
Is Gangnam back?

39
00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:53.600
Not yet.

40
00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:56.866
I didn't expect it to be so difficult this time

41
00:01:56.866 --> 00:01:59.833
Check his current location right away.
