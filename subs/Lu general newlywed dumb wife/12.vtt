00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:10.966
That's enough!

2
00:00:23.466 --> 00:00:25.666
Master Xia seems to have failed in his duties

3
00:00:26.066 --> 00:00:28.033
I don't care about you as much as you say

4
00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:32.766
Sure enough, pheasants just can't come and hang out?

5
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.033
I suggest you don't get carried away

6
00:00:45.966 --> 00:00:49.100
Jiangnan, you are very capable now, right?

7
00:00:49.366 --> 00:00:51.100
Ring, I listen to you.

8
00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:52.400
I'm not going to work

9
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:53.600
Never go again

10
00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.000
Don't embarrass the commander anymore, okay?

11
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.100
You know how to beg for mercy now

12
00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.833
It's late, I'll smash his store tomorrow

13
00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:03.900
Please.

14
00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.066
Come on, tell me what you want.

15
00:01:09.166 --> 00:01:09.966
brother

16
00:01:10.333 --> 00:01:11.133
brother

17
00:01:12.066 --> 00:01:13.033
Say what?

18
00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:16.166
brother

19
00:01:25.466 --> 00:01:26.266
Lan Lan

20
00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:28.266
From Now On

21
00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.366
I have nothing left.

22
00:01:31.066 --> 00:01:32.700
Did something happen?

23
00:01:35.166 --> 00:01:35.966
Why is that?

24
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.866
I will always be with you.

25
00:01:43.166 --> 00:01:44.066
Pardon me?

26
00:01:44.966 --> 00:01:49.033
I said I will always be with you, not my sister.

27
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:50.800
Lan Lan

28
00:01:51.533 --> 00:01:52.966
What did you just call me?
