00:00:00.733 --> 00:00:02.300
Chi says you are innocent

2
00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:05.766
I don't think you're innocent at all.

3
00:00:05.766 --> 00:00:07.966
You secretly investigate his whereabouts

4
00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:10.233
I know he came to the hotel with me

5
00:00:10.266 --> 00:00:12.433
So I couldn't wait to find him

6
00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:15.900
Why do you really take yourself for granted?

7
00:00:18.366 --> 00:00:20.000
But what's the use?

8
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.800
You are to him

9
00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.966
Like a kitten or a puppy

10
00:00:23.966 --> 00:00:26.966
When he was happy, he patted the puppy's head

11
00:00:27.333 --> 00:00:28.433
I advise you.

12
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.266
Don't waste your time.

13
00:00:31.866 --> 00:00:33.766
Where did an old hen come from?

14
00:00:33.766 --> 00:00:35.066
What are you calling this nonsense?

15
00:00:35.066 --> 00:00:36.633
Can't find the nest

16
00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:38.833
Lan Lan, don't be afraid

17
00:00:38.933 --> 00:00:41.800
You are the path and the justifiable wife

18
00:00:41.866 --> 00:00:44.600
Don't be afraid of this kind of pheasant who knows three things

19
00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:45.833
Who are you calling a pheasant?

20
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:47.666
Whoever promises to say it is who

21
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.166
You still want to hit me?

22
00:00:55.166 --> 00:00:56.866
Go back and buy some chicken soup to make up for it.

23
00:00:56.866 --> 00:01:00.700
After all, what to eat makes up for what to be so lazy

24
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.500
What are you doing at the hotel?

25
00:01:08.066 --> 00:01:11.000
Chi, I know this fourth lady

26
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.666
He's your best friend's sister

27
00:01:12.666 --> 00:01:14.933
But he seems to have misunderstood our relationship.

28
00:01:14.933 --> 00:01:17.500
Do you want to help me explain to him

29
00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.300
Our relationship is not what he thinks

30
00:01:20.766 --> 00:01:21.833
When to apply makeup?

31
00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:24.366
Dressed like this to 9 o'clock

32
00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:27.666
Answer me!

33
00:01:29.733 --> 00:01:30.833
Answer me!
