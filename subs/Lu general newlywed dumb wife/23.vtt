00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:01.866
The chick is pretty good-looking

2
00:00:01.933 --> 00:00:04.233
Go have a look go

3
00:00:08.266 --> 00:00:09.766
What about Jiangnan?

4
00:00:09.766 --> 00:00:11.633
Is the prince not with you?

5
00:00:12.866 --> 00:00:14.100
Night never comes home

6
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:15.900
Very capable

7
00:00:21.566 --> 00:00:24.233
Hello, the phone you dialed is turned off.

8
00:00:33.766 --> 00:00:35.866
Hey, little sister is alone?

9
00:00:35.866 --> 00:00:36.966
Just chat

10
00:00:36.966 --> 00:00:38.666
We are not bad people

11
00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:40.700
Why can't it be raised well?

12
00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.200
It's really not good to raise it well

13
00:00:51.966 --> 00:00:53.033
Hey what are you doing

14
00:00:56.766 --> 00:00:57.566
roll

15
00:00:59.933 --> 00:01:00.833
Are you all right?

16
00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:06.433
Now that you don't love me

17
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.366
Don't give me any more illusions like love

18
00:01:13.733 --> 00:01:16.100
Don't move. He knows it hurts.

19
00:01:16.166 --> 00:01:18.833
I thought you were really good at running away from home

20
00:01:19.266 --> 00:01:21.633
Who taught you? Answer me

21
00:01:24.333 --> 00:01:25.500
No one called me.

22
00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:26.900
You don't care about my feelings

23
00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:28.266
Why can't I go?

24
00:01:28.466 --> 00:01:29.966
You like Xia Yan so much

25
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:30.966
But don't look at it

26
00:01:30.966 --> 00:01:33.866
Spend 500 million for him but care about me

27
00:01:33.866 --> 00:01:35.966
I even have to pay back the money I spent when I was a child

28
00:01:35.966 --> 00:01:38.900
Then why did you bring me back?

29
00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:40.833
Can't we help each other?

30
00:01:44.266 --> 00:01:45.066
blue

31
00:01:45.566 --> 00:01:46.666
jealous

32
00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.200
It's over. I'm grounded.

33
00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.666
The camera was also confiscated.

34
00:01:59.666 --> 00:02:01.500
It's a pity so many negatives

35
00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:02.666
But your photo

36
00:02:02.666 --> 00:02:04.466
I still tried my best to get a few back

37
00:02:04.466 --> 00:02:05.333
Send it to you.

38
00:02:05.333 --> 00:02:06.600
Remember to check it?

39
00:02:06.733 --> 00:02:07.400
future

40
00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.066
You've started to take my words to heart now

41
00:02:10.066 --> 00:02:11.200
It's sealed, right?
