00:00:01.133 --> 00:00:03.100
I'm tired of that Maserati.

2
00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:05.200
You put a Lamborghini for me

3
00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:08.166
Ok I promise you

4
00:00:08.333 --> 00:00:11.433
You are not allowed to continue writing that mute for another month

5
00:00:16.566 --> 00:00:17.566
That's more like it.

6
00:00:25.366 --> 00:00:26.833
So you won't be angry?

7
00:00:29.733 --> 00:00:31.233
used to it

8
00:00:35.733 --> 00:00:37.066
You are such a fool

9
00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:44.633
Your favorite bubble tea.

10
00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:46.466
Drink something sweet

11
00:00:57.466 --> 00:00:58.266
Lan Lan

12
00:01:02.466 --> 00:01:03.766
This is the king's

13
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.200
Lan Lan, how are you?

14
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.100
I'm fine, it's just that my clothes are smashed.

15
00:01:16.533 --> 00:01:18.133
What about you? You didn't rise anywhere, did you?

16
00:01:18.133 --> 00:01:19.766
Boss, I'm fine too.

17
00:01:19.766 --> 00:01:21.300
These takeaway orders are about to expire.

18
00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:22.433
I have to deliver it quickly

19
00:01:23.733 --> 00:01:26.066
How can you deliver it when you are all wrapped up like this?

20
00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.100
Forget it, I'll go.

21
00:01:31.366 --> 00:01:33.666
Lan Lan, go change into my passive clothes

22
00:01:33.666 --> 00:01:34.733
You can't help me with the list.

23
00:01:34.733 --> 00:01:35.900
I'll give it to you on site.

24
00:01:40.666 --> 00:01:42.833
It's over, you wait for me in the lobby, I'll go to a game and come back

25
00:01:46.966 --> 00:01:47.766
Zhang Wan

26
00:01:48.266 --> 00:01:49.166
What are you doing here?

27
00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.233
You are here to find Ah Shi
