1
00:00:05.766 --> 00:00:06.566
Jiangnan

2
00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:07.600
Jiangnan

3
00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:09.866
Gangnam, you must not die

4
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:10.966
Do you hear me?

5
00:00:11.066 --> 00:00:13.033
I won't allow you to die, you can't die Jiangnan

6
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:36.800
How is the doctor?

7
00:00:37.133 --> 00:00:38.333
How to heal through melody

8
00:00:38.333 --> 00:00:39.800
Temporarily out of danger

9
00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.766
But after all, the game is whether the head can wake up

10
00:00:42.766 --> 00:00:44.200
Will there be any filtration?

11
00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:45.633
You need to protect the temperature

12
00:00:45.666 --> 00:00:47.000
Ok, thanks.

13
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:00.633
You're awake

14
00:01:03.566 --> 00:01:04.800
I'll call the doctor

15
00:01:12.266 --> 00:01:16.066
Since Liu Jingchi doesn't love me, why did he save me?

16
00:01:16.666 --> 00:01:18.366
Why don't you let me die?

17
00:01:18.933 --> 00:01:20.666
Haven't you hurt me enough?

18
00:01:24.366 --> 00:01:26.633
Mr. Lu, Mrs. Lu has no problem for the time being.

19
00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.633
We just need a brain CT.

20
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.500
To detect brain damage

21
00:01:30.733 --> 00:01:33.700
By the way, he has never been able to speak before.

22
00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:34.633
But

23
00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:37.766
Suddenly spoke after being hit

24
00:01:37.766 --> 00:01:39.000
What's the reason for this?

25
00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:41.500
Mrs. Lu's occurrence system is intact

26
00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:43.266
He couldn't speak before

27
00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:44.600
Probably psychological

28
00:01:44.733 --> 00:01:47.233
To achieve strong emotions is the opening of the process

29
00:01:48.133 --> 00:01:49.600
OK, I see.

30
00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:50.666
Thanks.

31
00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.966
Good night
