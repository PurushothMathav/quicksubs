1
00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:01.900
It's like who has no money

2
00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:02.900
You have money?

3
00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:04.800
You're not spending a married man's money.

4
00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.800
This money is still half of our Nan Nan

5
00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:09.066
It would be good if we Nan Nan didn't find you to catch up.

6
00:00:09.066 --> 00:00:10.500
You're still hanging around

7
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.000
You you what you

8
00:00:12.066 --> 00:00:13.066
Stop arguing, both of you

9
00:00:13.066 --> 00:00:14.133
Want me to say?

10
00:00:14.133 --> 00:00:16.000
Y'all try on this suit.

11
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.166
Compare to see who is more suitable

12
00:00:17.166 --> 00:00:19.400
Why is Nan Nan so beautiful?

13
00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.166
Will you still lose to him?

14
00:00:25.533 --> 00:00:26.700
This is copper.

15
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:28.400
This is the designer of the red copper.

16
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.766
He decides who gets the place.

17
00:00:30.766 --> 00:00:31.766
Is it okay?

18
00:00:31.766 --> 00:00:34.566
Do I want to keep the soil buns fresh or give them up properly?

19
00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.200
It's not certain who will humiliate themselves

20
00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:39.866
Have you decided yet?

21
00:00:39.866 --> 00:00:41.600
Whoever tries first, I'll go first

22
00:00:41.766 --> 00:00:43.200
I don't wear other people's haunts

23
00:00:43.866 --> 00:00:44.833
Ok this way please

24
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.766
You must look better in this dress than her
