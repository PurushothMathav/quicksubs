00:00:00.666 --> 00:00:03.766
Bring me all today's couriers and check them one by one.

2
00:00:06.666 --> 00:00:08.766
Can't wait

3
00:00:13.966 --> 00:00:17.433
Illusion he got me lost in lies

4
00:00:18.766 --> 00:00:22.033
Look away and compromise and be imprisoned

5
00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:24.066
Torn apart by the night

6
00:00:25.133 --> 00:00:28.233
I feel that he is looking through tears strongly

7
00:00:46.266 --> 00:00:49.000
These things shouldn't be here

8
00:00:49.366 --> 00:00:50.700
Did I ever tell you that?

9
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.400
Don't come with the forest again

10
00:00:52.933 --> 00:00:54.466
Why don't you listen to your mother?

11
00:00:54.966 --> 00:00:57.766
Why can't I even have a friend?

12
00:00:58.366 --> 00:01:00.266
But a broken heart

13
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.600
I've always had only you

14
00:01:05.866 --> 00:01:06.966
From small to large

15
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.233
I only have you

16
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.800
But there are many people around you

17
00:01:11.133 --> 00:01:12.366
No place for you.

18
00:01:12.966 --> 00:01:15.800
What is a cat in your heart?

19
00:01:20.733 --> 00:01:21.900
He's a dog.

20
00:01:23.533 --> 00:01:25.933
Lu insists that I am human

21
00:01:25.933 --> 00:01:27.700
I'm not a kitten or a puppy.

22
00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:29.166
Will have a heart

23
00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:30.933
It will be sad.

24
00:01:30.933 --> 00:01:32.800
I don't want to be like a puppy

25
00:01:32.966 --> 00:01:34.500
Sitting at home every day

26
00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.366
Looking forward to your return

27
00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.500
Then wait for you to touch my head

28
00:01:38.666 --> 00:01:40.633
I wagged my tail happily

29
00:01:40.766 --> 00:01:42.666
I'm really tired.
