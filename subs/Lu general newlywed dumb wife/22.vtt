future

2
00:00:34.166 --> 00:00:35.966
You need money, don't you?

3
00:00:35.966 --> 00:00:37.900
I'm reserved for whatever you want

4
00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:40.333
Are you eating less or wearing less?

5
00:00:40.333 --> 00:00:41.666
Hundreds of thousands

6
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.766
Just let you go out and show up

7
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.433
Why are you disobedient?

8
00:00:45.966 --> 00:00:48.300
Answer I owe you

9
00:00:48.533 --> 00:00:51.700
I will pay off the money I owe the Lu family

10
00:00:52.933 --> 00:00:53.900
Pardon me?

11
00:00:54.566 --> 00:00:56.833
This is your previous divorce offer

12
00:00:57.866 --> 00:00:58.900
I told you before.

13
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.200
Don't mention those two words in front of me again

14
00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.700
I'm tired, I'm really tired

15
00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.000
What is between us?

16
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.200
Between us

17
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.266
Prove our marriage

18
00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.600
It all started with my grandfather

19
00:01:18.066 --> 00:01:19.433
Don't you love me?

20
00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:20.600
Me too.

21
00:01:21.666 --> 00:01:22.466
Don't love you

22
00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:25.966
If you keep entangling, you can't support me

23
00:01:27.666 --> 00:01:28.466
Come on.

24
00:01:30.333 --> 00:01:31.633
I don't want this anymore.

25
00:01:32.066 --> 00:01:34.000
I want to have a serious talk

26
00:01:34.466 --> 00:01:36.866
I want to love someone with dignity

27
00:01:37.566 --> 00:01:38.800
Who do you want to fall in love with?

28
00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:41.433
Who do you want to love?

29
00:01:41.666 --> 00:01:42.600
Whose is it?

30
00:01:43.533 --> 00:01:44.600
As long as it's not you

31
00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:00.833
Is the baby hungry?

32
00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:03.400
Nothing.

33
00:02:03.933 --> 00:02:05.300
Mom, I'm sorry.

34
00:02:06.733 --> 00:02:07.533
Hey
