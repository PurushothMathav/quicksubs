00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:04.400
Why does it always feel like you've forgotten something?

2
00:00:08.266 --> 00:00:11.000
No, I'm divorced from the Army

3
00:00:12.166 --> 00:00:14.666
What's the matter, it doesn't matter now

4
00:00:18.166 --> 00:00:19.166
It was his life.

5
00:00:19.166 --> 00:00:20.100
It has been passed on to you.

6
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.100
Otherwise, Jiangnan and I would have divorced long ago

7
00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:25.066
Whether he dies or not has nothing to do with me

8
00:00:25.066 --> 00:00:26.166
I don't want you to save him.

9
00:00:26.566 --> 00:00:28.900
Trying to get a hammer is our memory management situation

10
00:00:28.966 --> 00:00:29.900
Once damaged

11
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:31.833
memory loss

12
00:00:32.166 --> 00:00:34.800
Then forget all the injuries

13
00:00:36.666 --> 00:00:39.533
Jiangnan, your memory has begun to decline

14
00:00:39.533 --> 00:00:41.900
You have to remember that you and Lu Jinshi have divorced

15
00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.533
And don't let him know you're pregnant

16
00:00:44.533 --> 00:00:46.233
You have to figure out a way to escape

17
00:00:49.933 --> 00:00:51.733
Now this will never love you

18
00:00:51.733 --> 00:00:53.233
Stop fantasizing

19
00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.433
What was I going to do?

20
00:01:09.466 --> 00:01:11.533
Yes, I remember now.

21
00:01:11.533 --> 00:01:13.266
I'm going to find a way to get out of here

22
00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:20.633
Why am I on the street?

23
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:23.900
too

24
00:01:24.333 --> 00:01:26.766
Miss Xiang, where are you going?

25
00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:30.100
I don't seem to remember

26
00:01:30.866 --> 00:01:32.066
How can you not remember

27
00:01:32.366 --> 00:01:34.433
I should be going back to Jiangting

28
00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.366
Assistant Liu, can you let me go?

29
00:01:38.066 --> 00:01:39.233
But

30
00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:41.666
All right. Let me take you home.

31
00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:50.700
Jiangnan

32
00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.866
You divorced Chi, what are you doing here?
