00:00:03.366 --> 00:00:04.900
Did you sleep peacefully?

2
00:00:05.766 --> 00:00:06.666
Sorry.

3
00:00:07.066 --> 00:00:09.566
I don't know how I fell asleep

4
00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:11.033
Have you eaten yet?

5
00:00:13.533 --> 00:00:14.333
Lan Lan

6
00:00:14.733 --> 00:00:18.000
Let's not go to the coffee shop to work in the future, okay?

7
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.500
Why is Sining such a person?

8
00:00:20.666 --> 00:00:22.100
He will bring you down

9
00:00:22.533 --> 00:00:24.100
I'll change your job.

10
00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:25.700
I loved it.

11
00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:27.233
I want to go back to work.

12
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.800
I said don't go

13
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.966
Don't associate with this love again

14
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:51.700
What else do you want to say?

15
00:00:55.733 --> 00:00:57.633
Let's get a divorce.

16
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:00.600
You're having a tantrum with me.

17
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:01.833
No temper tantrum

18
00:01:02.333 --> 00:01:05.000
I wanted to give it to you a long time ago

19
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:07.566
Because of Sining

20
00:01:07.933 --> 00:01:10.833
So you want to divorce me, right? It has nothing to do with him.

21
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.966
I want to divorce you myself

22
00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:16.400
Divorce is OK.

23
00:01:16.933 --> 00:01:18.600
You leave home

24
00:01:18.966 --> 00:01:21.900
Then spend all those years on you

25
00:01:21.933 --> 00:01:23.233
Give it all back

26
00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.766
When will you be back

27
00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.033
i

28
00:01:27.866 --> 00:01:29.566
When did I let you go?

29
00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:46.166
What do you mean?
