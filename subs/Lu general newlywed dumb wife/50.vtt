1
00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.766
I don't care how many shareholder meetings you hold

2
00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:04.666
I won't even vote for you

3
00:00:04.666 --> 00:00:05.466
understand

4
00:00:05.933 --> 00:00:06.733
So

5
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:08.766
I plan to drive

6
00:00:09.966 --> 00:00:11.100
One vote

7
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:13.700
You only have 30% of the shares

8
00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:16.700
My combined shares with Wanrou are the same as yours.

9
00:00:16.966 --> 00:00:18.933
Where did you get the one-vote power?

10
00:00:18.933 --> 00:00:22.400
You are wrong, I don't have 30%.

11
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.966
But 40% what

12
00:00:25.266 --> 00:00:26.833
Today is the 28th.

13
00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:29.966
It's my third wedding anniversary with Gangnam

14
00:00:29.966 --> 00:00:33.933
It is also 10% of the bones left to him by his grandfather

15
00:00:33.933 --> 00:00:35.766
The official effective date

16
00:00:36.066 --> 00:00:37.066
How is that possible?

17
00:00:37.066 --> 00:00:38.600
Grandpa before he died

18
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:39.933
Left a secret will

19
00:00:39.933 --> 00:00:42.433
He left me 30% of his shares

20
00:00:42.666 --> 00:00:45.300
The remaining 10% of love is reserved for Jiangnan

21
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:46.100
and

22
00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.300
On my third wedding anniversary with Gangnam

23
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:50.866
The will takes effect

24
00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:56.300
Mom

25
00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:57.600
Excuse me.

26
00:00:58.133 --> 00:01:01.466
I now have the right to make a one-vote decision

27
00:01:05.266 --> 00:01:07.266
They say dogs that bite don't bark

28
00:01:07.266 --> 00:01:09.100
I used to underestimate people

29
00:01:09.133 --> 00:01:11.633
Hold it down and let him sign it for me

30
00:01:17.566 --> 00:01:18.366
Let him go!
