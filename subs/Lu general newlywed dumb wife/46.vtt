00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.800
OK, I see.

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.266
Mrs. Lu just called her wife back to the old house

3
00:00:07.666 --> 00:00:08.466
Let's go

4
00:00:08.566 --> 00:00:09.366
Back to the old house

5
00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:11.666
Next week on the 28th.

6
00:00:11.666 --> 00:00:14.400
You and Jin-Chi are going to go through the divorce formalities, right?

7
00:00:14.866 --> 00:00:16.966
Is this what Jinchi means?

8
00:00:17.466 --> 00:00:18.600
And does it matter?

9
00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:19.966
You don't want a divorce

10
00:00:19.966 --> 00:00:20.900
I want to live forever

11
00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:22.900
Is the location of the young lady of Ba Lu's house?

12
00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.266
Jiangnan, our Lu family raised you

13
00:00:25.266 --> 00:00:26.966
That's kind and righteous.

14
00:00:26.966 --> 00:00:28.800
You can't take revenge for kindness, can you?

15
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.866
Even Kyoike is not young

16
00:00:31.866 --> 00:00:33.600
It's time for a progeny

17
00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:36.000
Can you give birth to a healthy child for him?

18
00:00:36.066 --> 00:00:39.066
Do you want me to be the heir of the Lu enterprise?

19
00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.800
Born a ridiculed mute

20
00:00:42.066 --> 00:00:44.000
The doctor said I wasn't born dumb

21
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.400
It's not heritable.

22
00:00:45.533 --> 00:00:48.366
There is a high probability that the child born will be healthy

23
00:00:48.366 --> 00:00:49.666
Very likely

24
00:00:49.766 --> 00:00:51.933
How big is it, can you guarantee it?

25
00:00:51.933 --> 00:00:54.700
Since there is no guarantee, who is willing to take the risk?

26
00:00:54.733 --> 00:00:58.266
The sooner you get a divorce, the worse it is for your myopia

27
00:00:58.733 --> 00:01:00.033
I'm getting a divorce.

28
00:01:00.066 --> 00:01:01.366
Why don't I know?

29
00:01:02.866 --> 00:01:04.766
What will happen to mom in the future?

30
00:01:04.766 --> 00:01:07.700
Please tell me directly about the oral culture of Jiangnan

31
00:01:07.933 --> 00:01:09.066
It's no use telling him

32
00:01:09.066 --> 00:01:10.233
Don't be mad at you.

33
00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.766
Ah we just chat

34
00:01:14.766 --> 00:01:16.866
Look at the way you're nervous

35
00:01:16.866 --> 00:01:18.266
He was joking.

36
00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:19.766
What am I nervous about?

37
00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:21.933
Come back into the pool

38
00:01:21.933 --> 00:01:23.900
Then I'll tell the kitchen to order

39
00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.233
It just so happens that our family has a meal

40
00:01:29.266 --> 00:01:30.200
Oh, right.

41
00:01:35.766 --> 00:01:36.666
What's up?

42
00:01:37.533 --> 00:01:39.633
What's wrong with you?

43
00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.433
What will happen to you in the future?

44
00:01:43.066 --> 00:01:44.200
I'm fine.

45
00:01:45.366 --> 00:01:46.933
I heard from the bodyguard

46
00:01:46.933 --> 00:01:48.666
He brought you here from the hospital

47
00:01:48.733 --> 00:01:51.333
What were you doing in the hospital?

48
00:01:51.333 --> 00:01:54.200
Nothing, just a little upset stomach

49
00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.300
gastrointestinal discomfort

50
00:01:55.766 --> 00:01:56.966
Why don't you tell him?
