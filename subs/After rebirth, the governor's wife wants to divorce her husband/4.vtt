00:00:01.166 --> 00:00:02.633
Gu Beichen

2
00:00:03.666 --> 00:00:05.233
Qin Zhuomei

3
00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:07.633
Qin Yuting

4
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.300
The grudge between us

5
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.633
About to start reckoning

6
00:00:19.933 --> 00:00:22.933
Beichen blames Lin Jingyun, that bitch

7
00:00:22.933 --> 00:00:24.066
If it weren't for him

8
00:00:24.066 --> 00:00:26.133
How could I be beaten by the old lady?

9
00:00:26.133 --> 00:00:29.833
I'm still pregnant with the flesh and blood of your tiger family in my stomach

10
00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:31.200
This Lin Jingyun

11
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.033
It's a little different during this time

12
00:00:34.666 --> 00:00:35.700
But don't worry.

13
00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:37.366
Don't you still have a backer?

14
00:00:37.366 --> 00:00:40.500
Your Qin family and the commander-in-chief used to have friendship

15
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.966
This is what my mother eats the most

16
00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.866
It will be my mother's birthday party soon.

17
00:00:45.866 --> 00:00:49.766
As long as you can invite the commander-in-chief over at the birthday banquet

18
00:00:49.866 --> 00:00:53.100
Then you will become a concubine

19
00:00:53.333 --> 00:00:55.200
My mother will definitely agree

20
00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:59.866
Beichen, I just don't like Lin Jingyun

21
00:00:59.933 --> 00:01:02.033
Then if I deal with him

22
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.666
Won't you be angry?

23
00:01:05.066 --> 00:01:06.866
I have long disliked their neighbors

24
00:01:06.866 --> 00:01:09.400
That kind of lofty gaze at home

25
00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.233
I don't care about his death

26
00:01:11.566 --> 00:01:14.633
It's you, how do you want to deal with him?

27
00:01:15.066 --> 00:01:19.166
Then you just wait and see the show

28
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.200
Lin Jingyun, just wait

29
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.166
I don't just want to marry into the Gu family

30
00:01:24.166 --> 00:01:27.200
And ruin your reputation at the birthday party

31
00:01:27.466 --> 00:01:29.300
Replace you completely

32
00:01:32.466 --> 00:01:35.966
Madam, you have really opened my eyes this time.

33
00:01:36.466 --> 00:01:37.766
If only

34
00:01:37.766 --> 00:01:38.566
maybe

35
00:01:38.566 --> 00:01:41.200
That treacherous water was really poured on you

36
00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:47.166
Sorry, sister.

37
00:01:47.166 --> 00:01:48.833
I just slipped my hand

38
00:01:49.066 --> 00:01:50.400
My mother doctor

39
00:01:51.166 --> 00:01:51.966
You did it on purpose

40
00:01:51.966 --> 00:01:54.166
Enough to pay back the money is not embarrassing enough?

41
00:01:54.166 --> 00:01:55.400
Go back and change your clothes

42
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:01.800
Chunxiao

43
00:02:02.166 --> 00:02:04.400
Take all my jewelry to the pawn shop

44
00:02:04.966 --> 00:02:06.033
Change to gold

45
00:02:06.066 --> 00:02:08.000
What? All this jewelry?

46
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.500
What do you use, ma'am?

47
00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.433
I want to use these jewelry

48
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.100
Open a new door to my life
