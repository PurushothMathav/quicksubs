1
00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.766
Qin Huomei, why are you here?

2
00:00:02.766 --> 00:00:04.800
Of course I'm here to buy jewelry.

3
00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:08.466
I heard that this store has a treasure in town.

4
00:00:08.466 --> 00:00:10.433
The shopkeeper's is this one.

5
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:13.333
Oh you bitch

6
00:00:13.333 --> 00:00:15.600
The temperament of a blue prostitute

7
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.300
I hate people robbing me the most in my life

8
00:00:19.333 --> 00:00:20.800
You little hoof

9
00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.566
Keep your mouth clean, what about me?

10
00:00:23.566 --> 00:00:26.033
Life is a love of robbing other people's things

11
00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:27.166
This necklace

12
00:00:27.366 --> 00:00:28.266
I want

13
00:00:29.333 --> 00:00:32.100
Qin Huomei, do you know who he is?

14
00:00:32.533 --> 00:00:34.266
You dare to rob him of his things

15
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.533
How dare you hit me?

16
00:00:36.533 --> 00:00:38.300
Did I hit you to pick a date?

17
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:39.266
That's not actually Miss

18
00:00:39.266 --> 00:00:40.900
Don't be noisy, don't be noisy

19
00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:42.766
Since you are all willing to

20
00:00:42.766 --> 00:00:44.900
It's better to blame the person

21
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.100
2,000 oceans

22
00:00:47.266 --> 00:00:48.433
2,000 oceans

23
00:00:48.566 --> 00:00:50.233
Is this lady lavish?

24
00:00:50.466 --> 00:00:51.766
I'm out of 5,000 oceans

25
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:52.833
Okay, okay.

26
00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:53.900
This lady

27
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.066
Don't regret it, Lin Jingyun, are you crazy?

28
00:00:57.066 --> 00:00:59.066
5,000 oceans you buy this necklace

29
00:00:59.933 --> 00:01:03.433
But my love words don't want anything

30
00:01:03.466 --> 00:01:04.733
No one wants to take it away

31
00:01:04.733 --> 00:01:08.200
The shopkeeper 10,000 ocean

32
00:01:08.333 --> 00:01:10.200
See how you want me

33
00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:11.700
Eleven thousand oceans

34
00:01:11.733 --> 00:01:13.733
Brother-in-law, don't bid indiscriminately

35
00:01:13.733 --> 00:01:15.666
Sister Jingyun, why don't you do this today?

36
00:01:15.666 --> 00:01:17.000
Met this crazy woman

37
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.900
I don't even have the desire to buy anything

38
00:01:19.133 --> 00:01:19.933
little

39
00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:22.100
Gems are valuable

40
00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:23.133
Emotions are priceless

41
00:01:23.133 --> 00:01:25.033
I'm willing to bet all my money

42
00:01:25.666 --> 00:01:26.700
Teach you the answer

43
00:01:30.133 --> 00:01:30.933
boss

44
00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.600
Look at my heirloom jade bracelet

45
00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:35.200
How much is it worth?

46
00:01:36.666 --> 00:01:37.466
OK

47
00:01:38.133 --> 00:01:39.933
This quality, this texture

48
00:01:39.933 --> 00:01:41.966
It's all estimated above.

49
00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.466
The minimum can not be less than 20,000

50
00:01:44.533 --> 00:01:46.766
Madam, have you considered it?

51
00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.033
Once we make a deal, it's not right to change it.

52
00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.300
I've thought about it, okay, okay.

53
00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:52.966
Then I have a deal

54
00:01:52.966 --> 00:01:55.700
Shopkeeper, I haven't shipped it yet.

55
00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:56.533
This lady

56
00:01:56.533 --> 00:01:57.500
Jade is priceless

57
00:01:57.566 --> 00:02:00.066
That's a once in a century.

58
00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.666
The reproductive air force is infinitely higher

59
00:02:02.666 --> 00:02:03.966
Please forgive me.

60
00:02:03.966 --> 00:02:06.366
I will improve this necklace, ma'am.

61
00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.666
The economy is too expensive

62
00:02:10.933 --> 00:02:12.400
As long as you like it.

63
00:02:13.066 --> 00:02:13.966
Here we go.

64
00:02:18.933 --> 00:02:20.000
Wow

65
00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.600
It's really beautiful.

66
00:02:23.466 --> 00:02:24.833
Just like it.

67
00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:26.833
Let's go back first

68
00:02:33.066 --> 00:02:34.200
Thrush sister

69
00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.700
Not everything you like

70
00:02:36.866 --> 00:02:38.466
You can take it away

71
00:02:45.333 --> 00:02:46.400
Miss Perfect

72
00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.366
This lady is too arrogant

73
00:02:48.366 --> 00:02:50.800
How dare you blatantly grab the necklace you like?

74
00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:51.933
Doesn't he know?

75
00:02:51.933 --> 00:02:53.966
Are you the Overseer's favorite person?

76
00:02:53.966 --> 00:02:54.766
Humph

77
00:02:55.266 --> 00:02:57.033
Isn't it just robbing something to eat?

78
00:02:57.366 --> 00:02:58.466
How to grab

79
00:03:07.166 --> 00:03:08.000
Who are you?

80
00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.066
Hand over the necklace around your neck

81
00:03:10.066 --> 00:03:11.400
I will spare your life.

82
00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:13.200
Dare to rob me

83
00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.566
Do you know who I am?

84
00:03:14.566 --> 00:03:16.500
Do you believe I let me back you?

85
00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:17.966
I don't care what your identity is

86
00:03:17.966 --> 00:03:21.000
There is no one in the boutique that our organization cannot afford to offend.

87
00:03:21.533 --> 00:03:22.633
Hand over

88
00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:27.566
In the future, rub your eyes on the bright spot in Jingming City

89
00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:29.866
Don't wrinkle, you shouldn't provoke people

90
00:03:47.166 --> 00:03:48.400
Thank you, Miss Huangmei.

91
00:03:52.766 --> 00:03:54.233
Wrap the necklace

92
00:03:54.766 --> 00:03:55.966
He Lin Jingyun

93
00:03:55.966 --> 00:03:58.366
You want to stop me from going to the sender ceremony

94
00:03:58.466 --> 00:04:01.200
Go crazy alone

95
00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:02.733
How is that possible?

96
00:04:02.733 --> 00:04:04.833
I prefer to dress up

97
00:04:05.066 --> 00:04:08.200
Then give the necklace to the mayor's daughter

98
00:04:09.066 --> 00:04:11.966
Give Beichen an unexpected surprise
