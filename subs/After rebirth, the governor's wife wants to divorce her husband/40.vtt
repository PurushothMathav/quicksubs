00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:01.533
The commander said

2
00:00:01.533 --> 00:00:03.333
As long as the tobacco business is successful

3
00:00:03.333 --> 00:00:04.566
Your position as overseer

4
00:00:04.566 --> 00:00:06.866
That is, a word from the commander

5
00:00:08.133 --> 00:00:10.200
Thank you, Mr. Li. Thank you

6
00:00:15.666 --> 00:00:16.800
That's fine.

7
00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:19.566
This time with the support of the Commander-in-Chief

8
00:00:19.733 --> 00:00:22.100
This time the original gambling business will definitely succeed

9
00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:23.500
Oh dad

10
00:00:23.733 --> 00:00:25.966
I agree to mortgage the house.

11
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.066
Is that so?

12
00:00:27.066 --> 00:00:31.366
Sign the mortgage agreement with the village today

13
00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:40.866
Xiao Chen

14
00:00:40.866 --> 00:00:41.766
a while

15
00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:46.033
I'll send someone to bring 100,000 ocean to your house

16
00:00:46.566 --> 00:00:47.366
OK

17
00:00:49.366 --> 00:00:52.666
Qin Huamei, remember what time you said

18
00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:55.000
If I just found out

19
00:00:55.466 --> 00:00:59.166
It's not my Jingyun at first glance.

20
00:00:59.266 --> 00:01:00.566
Got it, Uncle Lin

21
00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:05.533
The Lin family will wait for the tobacco soil to arrive in Jingping this time.

22
00:01:05.533 --> 00:01:08.800
I'm going to put your Lin family in a doomed place

23
00:01:08.933 --> 00:01:10.033
Hey goldfish

24
00:01:10.266 --> 00:01:11.666
Thanks to you this time

25
00:01:11.766 --> 00:01:13.966
If the Gu family can come back to life this time

26
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.966
You did it.

27
00:01:16.933 --> 00:01:18.100
Don't thank me.

28
00:01:18.266 --> 00:01:20.600
The tobacco business is a love story that I didn't think of

29
00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.700
If you want to thank him, thank him

30
00:01:28.766 --> 00:01:32.033
This time, the Lin family jumped in by themselves

31
00:01:32.066 --> 00:01:33.466
Don't Blame Me

32
00:01:33.466 --> 00:01:35.400
Lin Bohai, this old thing

33
00:01:35.533 --> 00:01:37.200
You want to mortgage my CEO?

34
00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.166
If you come in along the way the day after tomorrow

35
00:01:39.333 --> 00:01:40.666
Can you move to the Lin's house?

36
00:01:41.533 --> 00:01:46.666
Don't worry, as long as we sacrifice a little bit of smoke and soil

37
00:01:46.933 --> 00:01:49.300
Can be charged with selling tobacco

38
00:01:49.366 --> 00:01:51.500
Buckle it on the Lin family's head

39
00:01:54.333 --> 00:01:58.400
Hey, I'm dying
