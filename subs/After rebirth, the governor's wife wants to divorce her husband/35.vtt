00:00:00.533 --> 00:00:02.300
You know it's a trap

2
00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:03.966
Why are you jumping in?

3
00:00:03.966 --> 00:00:05.266
Yes, Jingyun

4
00:00:05.266 --> 00:00:07.800
Can't you be willful about this?

5
00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:08.866
A little careless

6
00:00:08.866 --> 00:00:12.800
Our Lin family will fall into a forbidden land that will never be restored

7
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.833
Mother I know

8
00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:17.333
But he, Gu Beichen, has long been eyeing our Lin family

9
00:00:17.333 --> 00:00:19.700
Just let them go

10
00:00:21.966 --> 00:00:24.833
What do you mean, girl?

11
00:00:25.066 --> 00:00:27.500
He Gu Beichen didn't want to do tobacco business

12
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:28.866
Do you want to attract investment?

13
00:00:29.366 --> 00:00:31.800
Then we'll let him go

14
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:32.600
Goldfish

15
00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:34.466
What do you want?

16
00:00:34.533 --> 00:00:37.366
I want them to take care of their family

17
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:39.466
die

18
00:00:40.533 --> 00:00:41.333
Golden Moon

19
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.800
Father and mother have promised to invest in us, right?

20
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:47.933
Great from now on

21
00:00:47.933 --> 00:00:50.366
The entire golden bottle will be in our hands

22
00:00:50.366 --> 00:00:52.200
Hahaha Wei Chen

23
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.266
What about this?

24
00:00:53.266 --> 00:00:54.733
Jingyun has helped a lot

25
00:00:54.733 --> 00:00:56.400
You have to treat her well

26
00:00:56.666 --> 00:00:58.400
It's golden moon

27
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.700
As a member of the Gu family

28
00:01:01.066 --> 00:01:02.766
Something like this happened to the Gu family

29
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.666
My wife naturally has to contribute

30
00:01:05.666 --> 00:01:08.700
Sister, are you doing well?

31
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.833
But our Lin family is not without conditions

32
00:01:12.366 --> 00:01:15.300
What is this in-law helping in-law?

33
00:01:15.466 --> 00:01:17.000
What other terms are there to discuss?

34
00:01:17.333 --> 00:01:19.666
And it's very simple.

35
00:01:19.666 --> 00:01:21.766
Our neighbor's business has been sluggish recently.

36
00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.766
I heard that the tobacco business is very profitable

37
00:01:23.766 --> 00:01:25.700
So we want to get involved.
