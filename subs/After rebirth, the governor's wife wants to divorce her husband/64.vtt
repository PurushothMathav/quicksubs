00:00:00.466 --> 00:00:03.300
Yeah, forget about the past

2
00:00:03.366 --> 00:00:05.366
Forget it, Gu Beichen

3
00:00:05.366 --> 00:00:07.200
You abandoned me at the City Lord's Mansion

4
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.266
Then put all the charges

5
00:00:08.266 --> 00:00:09.866
Pushed on me alone

6
00:00:09.866 --> 00:00:10.933
Without a commander in chief

7
00:00:10.933 --> 00:00:12.400
I would have died in the City Lord's Mansion long ago

8
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:13.200
Oh, dear.

9
00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:15.633
Qin talk about Mei

10
00:00:15.866 --> 00:00:18.533
Plum, don't push your luck

11
00:00:18.533 --> 00:00:20.566
At that time, Beichen was the overseer

12
00:00:20.566 --> 00:00:21.933
He can take you as a concubine

13
00:00:21.933 --> 00:00:23.766
That is also the blessing of your coal melting

14
00:00:23.766 --> 00:00:24.900
And now?

15
00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.200
Also because of you

16
00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.500
Beichen lost his position as overseer

17
00:00:28.533 --> 00:00:31.933
Our family has also fallen into this state

18
00:00:31.933 --> 00:00:34.766
What else do you want?

19
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.266
Because when I dealt with Lin Jingyun

20
00:00:38.266 --> 00:00:39.900
Gu Beichen has no shortage of ideas, right?

21
00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:41.766
Later, Lin Jingyun robbed the old home

22
00:00:41.766 --> 00:00:43.900
You're going to blame everything on me

23
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.300
Okay, we're on the same side now

24
00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.700
Only when that person becomes the commander-in-chief

25
00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:51.066
We have a chance to distribute

26
00:00:51.266 --> 00:00:53.000
Don't you want to get revenge on Lin Jingyun?

27
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.600
Hua Bai, I promise you

28
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.300
As long as Lin Jingyun is solved

29
00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.700
I was in charge of the negative.

30
00:00:58.966 --> 00:01:02.066
I only love you in my life

31
00:01:05.333 --> 00:01:06.166
Lin Junyun

32
00:01:06.166 --> 00:01:09.800
This time I must let you die without a burial

33
00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.566
Gang Master, that money quilt really escaped

34
00:01:12.566 --> 00:01:14.700
I see. OK. Go on.

35
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.400
It seems that someone inside you has turned against the water.
