00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:04.066
Beichen gives you one last chance

2
00:00:04.066 --> 00:00:06.366
Kneel down and apologize to Junjun

3
00:00:06.366 --> 00:00:09.600
I can let go of the past

4
00:00:09.666 --> 00:00:10.500
No.

5
00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:12.000
Lin Jianyuan

6
00:00:14.066 --> 00:00:15.366
Signed this divorce letter

7
00:00:15.366 --> 00:00:16.600
From now on

8
00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:20.000
Your neighbor has nothing to do with me.

9
00:00:21.566 --> 00:00:24.500
Ok I am as you wish

10
00:00:32.066 --> 00:00:33.300
Only today

11
00:00:34.533 --> 00:00:36.400
I divorced you

12
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:42.933
Congratulations Beichen is better

13
00:00:42.933 --> 00:00:44.166
Don't ask the Lins

14
00:00:44.166 --> 00:00:45.600
Too late

15
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.566
I will frame what happened to the Lin family

16
00:00:48.566 --> 00:00:51.866
I want the Lin family to know the price of offending me

17
00:00:51.866 --> 00:00:52.666
Humph

18
00:00:53.333 --> 00:00:54.666
Congratulations to the Commander-in-Chief

19
00:00:54.666 --> 00:00:57.766
What are you congratulating me on?

20
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.300
The commander-in-chief's shipment has arrived

21
00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:02.833
What goods?

22
00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:04.333
Commander-in-Chief, don't you know?

23
00:01:04.333 --> 00:01:06.800
Didn't all your eloquence make me feel at ease to do it?

24
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.600
What do you mean by that?

25
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.566
Commander Zhu, I came to tell you before that

26
00:01:11.566 --> 00:01:12.766
You don't want to know

27
00:01:12.766 --> 00:01:14.833
Why did my father know about our relationship?

28
00:01:14.933 --> 00:01:17.000
Still give you 100,000 ocean

29
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:17.933
What do you mean?

30
00:01:17.933 --> 00:01:19.466
I told him to.

31
00:01:19.566 --> 00:01:21.266
Because I'm going to make you rich.

32
00:01:23.066 --> 00:01:24.233
Huo Renwang

33
00:01:26.133 --> 00:01:27.800
Sir, it's hard to say.

34
00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.966
What did the people of the city lord's mansion seize from those cigarette owners?
