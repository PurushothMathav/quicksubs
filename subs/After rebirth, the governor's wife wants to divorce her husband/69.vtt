1
00:00:03.466 --> 00:00:05.233
How is Miss Lin? Did you find it?

2
00:00:05.333 --> 00:00:06.500
No, I can't find it.

3
00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:07.400
Ready to enter Pingcheng

4
00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.066
Miss Lin was not found

5
00:00:09.066 --> 00:00:10.900
Where has this living person gone?

6
00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:12.000
Find it, hurry up

7
00:00:12.666 --> 00:00:13.633
Uncle Commander

8
00:00:13.966 --> 00:00:16.566
The appointed time with the city lord is almost up

9
00:00:16.566 --> 00:00:17.900
Let's go first

10
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:28.600
What about Sister Jingyun?

11
00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.200
I didn't see Sister Jingyun when I came

12
00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.000
I have sent someone to patrol

13
00:00:34.733 --> 00:00:35.833
Not found

14
00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.100
What's the matter I doubt

15
00:00:39.333 --> 00:00:41.066
Jingyun may have been tied up

16
00:00:41.066 --> 00:00:43.733
What Jingyun was kidnapped?

17
00:00:43.733 --> 00:00:44.900
Who is so bold?

18
00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:47.000
Dare to fly fish in shrewd castle man

19
00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.466
Don't worry, I will definitely find someone for you.

20
00:00:50.466 --> 00:00:51.866
I'm not worried about that.

21
00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.266
But I suspect the person who tied up Jingyun

22
00:00:54.266 --> 00:00:55.233
Really inviting

23
00:00:56.466 --> 00:00:59.700
Threatening you to say that, you know who it is

24
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:02.033
During this time, I have been investigating in the boutique city

25
00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.466
Information about the man who sells tobacco

26
00:01:04.666 --> 00:01:05.600
Some time ago

27
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.233
Qin Yumei was rescued from the city's mansions

28
00:01:08.466 --> 00:01:10.300
I suspect it was the man who did it.

29
00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:11.633
Any suspects?

30
00:01:11.733 --> 00:01:13.566
I do have a suspect

31
00:01:13.566 --> 00:01:16.166
And that person

32
00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:18.633
Right next to me
