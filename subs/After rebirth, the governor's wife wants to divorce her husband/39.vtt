00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:01.900
How can this be?

2
00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:05.033
Dad, is this a bit too much?

3
00:00:05.166 --> 00:00:06.366
excessive

4
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.900
I wouldn't say that.

5
00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:12.233
That's 100,000 oceans.

6
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.633
Of course, you don't have to.

7
00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:18.366
Then this investment

8
00:00:18.733 --> 00:00:20.700
That's wrong.

9
00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:22.900
Huamei

10
00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:24.633
Are you sure?

11
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.300
So yo

12
00:00:28.166 --> 00:00:29.266
What a coincidence

13
00:00:29.766 --> 00:00:31.033
Everybody's here.

14
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.600
Why are you here?

15
00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:35.566
Me?

16
00:00:36.133 --> 00:00:37.966
I heard there's a deal here today

17
00:00:37.966 --> 00:00:41.266
Xiaozhi will come over to see if he can get involved

18
00:00:41.566 --> 00:00:43.466
Who did you listen to this gang leader?

19
00:00:43.466 --> 00:00:45.666
We're just having tea here

20
00:00:48.733 --> 00:00:50.566
The commander sent me here

21
00:00:51.066 --> 00:00:51.866
Commander in Chief

22
00:00:52.966 --> 00:00:55.666
Mr. Gu's tobacco business

23
00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:58.066
The Lord Commander is particularly interested

24
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:02.933
Really, if this business had a commander

25
00:01:02.933 --> 00:01:04.433
That's great.

26
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:05.566
What about my husband?

27
00:01:05.566 --> 00:01:07.166
Came on behalf of the commander-in-chief

28
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.533
The commander-in-chief asked you to do it with confidence

29
00:01:09.533 --> 00:01:10.666
At that time

30
00:01:10.666 --> 00:01:13.633
Don't forget to give the commander-in-chief a share of the pie

31
00:01:14.933 --> 00:01:16.600
The other commander, you go back and tell the commander-in-chief

32
00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:17.966
Honor them then

33
00:01:17.966 --> 00:01:19.766
I can't miss a penny

34
00:01:19.866 --> 00:01:20.800
That would be fine.

35
00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.466
I'm here today to tell you

36
00:01:24.566 --> 00:01:25.300
That's right.

37
00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:27.700
The Lord Commander will hold a birthday dinner the night after tomorrow

38
00:01:27.733 --> 00:01:31.100
Hope to hear the good news then.

39
00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:32.866
Don't worry, King Li.

40
00:01:33.066 --> 00:01:35.566
As long as the smoke soil enters our golden bottle the day after tomorrow

41
00:01:35.566 --> 00:01:37.133
Just the whole golden bottle

42
00:01:37.133 --> 00:01:39.800
All in the palm of our commander

43
00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:45.966
I want to ask

44
00:01:46.133 --> 00:01:48.766
About my Bible reading position
