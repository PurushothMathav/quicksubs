00:00:01.666 --> 00:00:03.433
Paige, what about us?

2
00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:05.766
Help Me

3
00:00:10.166 --> 00:00:11.166
Jinzumei

4
00:00:11.666 --> 00:00:14.233
What is it like to be betrayed by the man you love?

5
00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:16.100
today

6
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.600
It's all planned by you

7
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:21.400
Right.

8
00:00:22.366 --> 00:00:24.566
You're down in a few rounds

9
00:00:24.733 --> 00:00:27.000
If there are any other tricks, just use them.

10
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.766
I am waiting for you in Kujiang

11
00:00:31.166 --> 00:00:31.966
Ah!

12
00:00:33.466 --> 00:00:34.266
myself

13
00:00:43.566 --> 00:00:46.033
My child was killed by you

14
00:00:46.366 --> 00:00:48.200
I will make you pay with your life

15
00:00:53.866 --> 00:00:54.800
Did you listen?

16
00:00:54.866 --> 00:00:57.666
What are you still doing at my house after so long?

17
00:00:57.666 --> 00:00:59.433
Why don't you get out of here?

18
00:01:00.266 --> 00:01:01.366
Beichen

19
00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:04.066
Do people know they are wrong?

20
00:01:13.566 --> 00:01:15.266
Just forgive me, okay?

21
00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:24.000
Brother Beichen

22
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.500
Are you not angry?

23
00:01:25.533 --> 00:01:28.566
Although the position of the deputy city lord is gone

24
00:01:28.666 --> 00:01:31.500
But I can send the Gu family to Kenya's enemy country

25
00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.233
As long as you have money

26
00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:34.300
Husband

27
00:01:34.466 --> 00:01:37.500
Isn't the position of commander-in-chief still possible?

28
00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.300
You want to make me money

29
00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.000
Not making money

30
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.566
Is to make big money

31
00:01:42.566 --> 00:01:44.600
Our Qin family relies on this business

32
00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.566
Become the first family in Jiangzhou

33
00:01:46.666 --> 00:01:48.600
Just do this business well

34
00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.466
We can make the whole dragonfly

35
00:01:50.466 --> 00:01:52.000
It's in our hands.

36
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.233
What business do you want to talk about?

37
00:01:55.133 --> 00:01:55.966
supervise

38
00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:58.900
chimney

39
00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.433
No, that's something the city lord has banned

40
00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.966
Sometimes banned things make a lot of money

41
00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:08.833
You mean?

42
00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:12.600
Your Qin family relied on smoke and soil to do it quickly at that time

43
00:02:12.666 --> 00:02:13.466
Right

44
00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.900
It's a pity that my parents were killed

45
00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.900
Our Qin family has been reduced to this

46
00:02:19.166 --> 00:02:20.233
Brother Beichen

47
00:02:20.266 --> 00:02:21.966
I still have channels for tobacco soil in my hands

48
00:02:21.966 --> 00:02:23.566
As long as there are enough funds

49
00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:27.400
I can make the whole golden bottle our world

50
00:02:29.133 --> 00:02:30.100
How much will it cost?

51
00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.933
If you try the water initially, you only need 50,000

52
00:02:32.933 --> 00:02:35.366
Cleaning if efficient

53
00:02:35.366 --> 00:02:39.500
You can get 2 points in half a month.

54
00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.200
As long as I master the tobacco business

55
00:02:43.466 --> 00:02:46.633
Both the city lord and the commander-in-chief have to look at my example

56
00:02:48.566 --> 00:02:51.266
Oh, brother Beichen.

57
00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.500
Don't be angry.

58
00:02:53.733 --> 00:02:55.866
People do this

59
00:02:55.966 --> 00:02:57.766
Make up for it

60
00:02:58.566 --> 00:03:01.566
It depends on your performance
