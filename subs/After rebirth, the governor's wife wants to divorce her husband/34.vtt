00:00:00.566 --> 00:00:02.800
Did Gu Beichen's Xiao Diao bully you?

2
00:00:03.533 --> 00:00:05.233
Dad, don't worry.

3
00:00:05.866 --> 00:00:06.900
I'm back this time

4
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:09.566
Do you want to discuss something with you?

5
00:00:09.566 --> 00:00:10.566
Say today

6
00:00:11.133 --> 00:00:12.666
Although Gu Beichen was fired

7
00:00:12.766 --> 00:00:14.266
But he never dies

8
00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:16.800
He wants to borrow the power of that woman

9
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:17.800
refine

10
00:00:18.366 --> 00:00:19.600
Do tobacco business

11
00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:22.266
What tobacco business

12
00:00:22.466 --> 00:00:24.766
That was clearly forbidden by the city lord

13
00:00:24.766 --> 00:00:28.166
Anyone who does something serious has to raid their house

14
00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:32.266
In the last life, because he trusted Gu Beichen too much

15
00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.500
Even if parents object

16
00:00:34.566 --> 00:00:36.666
We're still insisting that they invest.

17
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.733
And finally.

18
00:00:37.733 --> 00:00:40.500
Gu Beichen dumped all the charges on the Lin family

19
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.566
Led to the Lin family being raided by the police

20
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.466
Parents, I'm sorry for you.

21
00:00:47.566 --> 00:00:49.233
Jin Yun, get up

22
00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.133
How can parents blame you?

23
00:00:51.133 --> 00:00:53.366
Yes, Jingyun wants to say fault.

24
00:00:53.366 --> 00:00:55.300
That was also his Gu Beichen's fault

25
00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.300
Now I still want to sell tobacco

26
00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.033
Just courting death

27
00:00:59.333 --> 00:01:00.133
Dad

28
00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:04.666
Mother, I want you to invest in his tobacco business

29
00:01:04.666 --> 00:01:07.233
What nonsense are you talking about today?
