00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.533
Do you hate Lin Jingyun?

2
00:00:01.533 --> 00:00:03.133
How not to hate

3
00:00:03.133 --> 00:00:04.900
He made me homeless.

4
00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:06.666
I became what I am now

5
00:00:06.666 --> 00:00:08.466
I can't wait to cut him into pieces

6
00:00:08.466 --> 00:00:11.266
That's good, he is Li Feiyu's weakness

7
00:00:11.266 --> 00:00:14.800
Do you mean to start against Lin Jingyun?

8
00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:18.100
It was Lin Jingyun who wanted to cut him into pieces

9
00:00:18.266 --> 00:00:20.066
Commander-in-Chief, don't you dare say that

10
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.166
6th of every month

11
00:00:21.266 --> 00:00:23.200
Li Feiyu will go to the City Lord's Mansion

12
00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.900
Discuss with the city lord the management and development of Jingping City

13
00:00:25.933 --> 00:00:26.900
I will follow

14
00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:29.300
Before that, you tied up Lin Jingyun

15
00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.800
Then I have the capital to negotiate with Li Feiyu

16
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.166
I can't wait to help him now

17
00:00:34.166 --> 00:00:36.900
I want him to know who the real master is

18
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:38.233
After everyone is done

19
00:00:38.366 --> 00:00:39.366
Don't contact me.

20
00:00:39.366 --> 00:00:40.466
Let Huomei contact me.

21
00:00:40.466 --> 00:00:43.466
I only believe he is your commander-in-chief

22
00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.333
If I were to become the commander-in-chief

23
00:00:46.333 --> 00:00:47.933
You are the deputy commander in chief

24
00:00:47.933 --> 00:00:49.833
Then I will first thank the commander-in-chief

25
00:00:52.333 --> 00:00:53.800
Do it right.

26
00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.100
This is your only chance to come back

27
00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:57.666
Don't worry.

28
00:00:57.666 --> 00:01:00.400
The Commander-in-Chief will certainly live up to your expectations

29
00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:04.266
Huang Mei, are you alright?

30
00:01:04.266 --> 00:01:06.666
It's okay, Gu Beichen

31
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.566
Do you think I look like a fine person now?

32
00:01:11.366 --> 00:01:13.533
Huang Mei, that's all in the past

33
00:01:13.533 --> 00:01:15.800
Why do you still mention him?
