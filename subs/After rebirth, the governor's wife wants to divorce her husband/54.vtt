00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:02.300
Mr. Chen

2
00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:03.300
Mr. Chen

3
00:00:03.666 --> 00:00:05.666
It's not our country's idea to sell along the way

4
00:00:05.733 --> 00:00:06.466
It's all the Lin family

5
00:00:06.466 --> 00:00:08.200
This was all the Lins' idea

6
00:00:08.866 --> 00:00:10.300
Yes, Mr. Chen

7
00:00:10.666 --> 00:00:11.466
along the way

8
00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:12.533
All neighbors

9
00:00:12.533 --> 00:00:13.533
They tempt us

10
00:00:13.533 --> 00:00:15.066
We went astray

11
00:00:15.666 --> 00:00:16.466
Please hold on, my lord

12
00:00:16.466 --> 00:00:19.400
Folk, you really can't get enough

13
00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.466
Fu Beichen, you are still quibbling

14
00:00:23.866 --> 00:00:26.000
The batch of tobacco soil you bought

15
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.566
It has been seized by me.

16
00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:29.800
Those people also gave you up

17
00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.000
What else do you want to say?

18
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.800
Gu Beichen, a man must dare to act

19
00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.800
I really look down on you like this

20
00:00:36.366 --> 00:00:37.700
Li Feiyu, shut up for me

21
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:38.933
It's all your fault

22
00:00:38.933 --> 00:00:41.366
It's all because you and Lin Jingyun framed me

23
00:00:41.366 --> 00:00:42.166
This lord

24
00:00:42.166 --> 00:00:44.666
He framed me to shut up

25
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:47.366
If it weren't for Jingyun

26
00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.566
You still don't know

27
00:00:49.566 --> 00:00:51.933
You're doing this kind of thing behind your back

28
00:00:51.933 --> 00:00:53.533
You have disappointed me so much.

29
00:00:53.533 --> 00:00:55.766
Mr. Cheng, Mr. Cheng is not

30
00:00:55.766 --> 00:00:56.566
Guo Weicheng

31
00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:58.866
You were the overseer of Jingping City

32
00:00:58.966 --> 00:00:59.733
I believe

33
00:00:59.733 --> 00:01:02.400
You won't do anything wrong to Jingping

34
00:01:02.766 --> 00:01:04.066
You are Lord Shinji Mingjian

35
00:01:04.066 --> 00:01:07.000
But the clay thing.

36
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.233
Someone must be behind this

37
00:01:09.966 --> 00:01:11.666
Confess that person

38
00:01:11.733 --> 00:01:14.266
I could consider taking it lightly

39
00:01:15.333 --> 00:01:17.233
It's him, Lord Zhengzhou

40
00:01:17.333 --> 00:01:19.033
It's all him, it's his little one

41
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.200
Wei Chen you

42
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.266
You shut up

43
00:01:25.566 --> 00:01:26.733
It's all you bitch

44
00:01:26.733 --> 00:01:27.400
If it weren't for you

45
00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.633
Can I mix like this?

46
00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:30.466
If it weren't for you

47
00:01:30.466 --> 00:01:32.266
I have already sat in the position of deputy city lord

48
00:01:32.266 --> 00:01:33.200
It's all you who are cheap

49
00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.566
Robbed the city lord's daughter's necklace

50
00:01:34.566 --> 00:01:35.666
He also beat the daughter of the city lord

51
00:01:35.666 --> 00:01:37.133
I lost my place as a solitary soldier

52
00:01:37.133 --> 00:01:38.866
It also caused me to lose my position as the deputy city lord

53
00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.133
It was he who reassured me

54
00:01:41.133 --> 00:01:43.300
Saying that the business along the way is absolutely foolproof

55
00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:44.500
I just believe him

56
00:01:47.066 --> 00:01:50.433
Qin Huomei's pet you are proud of

57
00:01:50.733 --> 00:01:52.266
So unbearable
