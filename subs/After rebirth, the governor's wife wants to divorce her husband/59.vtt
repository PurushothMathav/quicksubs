00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.000
Do you think I will beg you for mercy?

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.266
Dream forest crystal cloud

3
00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:07.300
Even if I die, I won't let you go

4
00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:09.100
If you say so

5
00:00:09.133 --> 00:00:11.233
Then we have nothing to talk about

6
00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:12.333
I wanted to come over

7
00:00:12.333 --> 00:00:15.166
Give you a chance to live again

8
00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:18.166
Live hahahaha

9
00:00:18.166 --> 00:00:19.866
You will keep me alive

10
00:00:19.866 --> 00:00:20.766
Hahaha

11
00:00:20.966 --> 00:00:23.500
Now there's a chance to keep you alive

12
00:00:23.566 --> 00:00:25.400
It depends on whether you cherish it or not.

13
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:26.533
Then say it.

14
00:00:26.533 --> 00:00:28.500
Who is your boss?

15
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.400
Where did that huge amount of smoke come from?

16
00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:31.666
It turns out that Gang Master Li

17
00:00:31.666 --> 00:00:33.966
Are you so interested in this?

18
00:00:33.966 --> 00:00:36.600
Yeah, as long as you tell me who your boss is

19
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:37.866
I can call the shots for you.

20
00:00:38.166 --> 00:00:40.266
Spare your life, I want to say too

21
00:00:40.866 --> 00:00:44.933
But I'll still die after I say it

22
00:00:44.933 --> 00:00:45.766
So?

23
00:00:45.766 --> 00:00:48.066
I choose not to say that you are not very smart

24
00:00:48.066 --> 00:00:50.533
Find it yourself if you have the ability.

25
00:00:50.533 --> 00:00:52.000
As long as he is there

26
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.900
You're both going to die.

27
00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.000
You two ruined his big deal

28
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.966
Do you think he will let you go?

29
00:01:01.566 --> 00:01:03.433
Since you are so obsessive

30
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.766
Then I have nothing more to tell you.

31
00:01:09.666 --> 00:01:12.400
What awaits you next will be death

32
00:01:12.566 --> 00:01:15.266
Even your days will turn into beautiful bones that will wrap around you

33
00:01:15.266 --> 00:01:18.100
Lin Jingyue, I will haunt you for the rest of my life

34
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.600
Let go of me! What are you doing?

35
00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:21.733
Someone helped me to save you

36
00:01:21.733 --> 00:01:24.666
Keep quiet and find a chance to go out by yourself at night

37
00:01:29.166 --> 00:01:30.966
It's Beichen, it must be Beichen

38
00:01:30.966 --> 00:01:33.033
It was Beichen who asked someone to save me
