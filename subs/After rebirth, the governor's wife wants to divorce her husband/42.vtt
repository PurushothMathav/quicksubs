00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.066
What are you talking about?

2
00:00:01.066 --> 00:00:01.966
Who is following you?

3
00:00:01.966 --> 00:00:04.066
Our wife is just out for a walk

4
00:00:05.333 --> 00:00:07.300
Scary people should have scary rules

5
00:00:08.766 --> 00:00:11.133
Sister, this is scary and insensible

6
00:00:11.133 --> 00:00:12.700
I'll teach you a lesson

7
00:00:13.333 --> 00:00:14.700
Do you mind?

8
00:00:15.333 --> 00:00:16.400
I don't mind.

9
00:00:18.133 --> 00:00:18.766
you

10
00:00:18.766 --> 00:00:22.266
If you dare to hit my concubine, you should look like a concubine

11
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.200
Show off your power in front of me

12
00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:25.833
Shouldn't fight

13
00:00:25.866 --> 00:00:27.233
I'm not talking nonsense with you either.

14
00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.166
I'm here to follow you

15
00:00:30.166 --> 00:00:31.566
Follow Me

16
00:00:32.366 --> 00:00:33.633
You came here today?

17
00:00:33.933 --> 00:00:37.266
Isn't it just the tobacco business with your last family?

18
00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:38.900
What do you want?

19
00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:43.400
I just want to see who your last family is

20
00:00:43.466 --> 00:00:45.400
I'm afraid you'll be disappointed.

21
00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.233
This tobacco business?

22
00:00:47.366 --> 00:00:48.500
It's mine.

23
00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.066
Miss Qin really loves to joke

24
00:00:52.366 --> 00:00:53.700
This tobacco business

25
00:00:54.466 --> 00:00:55.566
I'm afraid you will accept it.

26
00:00:59.666 --> 00:01:00.966
How about we talk about cooperation?

27
00:01:00.966 --> 00:01:03.533
The leader of the gang came on behalf of the commander-in-chief

28
00:01:03.533 --> 00:01:04.566
Not really.

29
00:01:04.733 --> 00:01:07.266
This time I'm representing myself

30
00:01:07.266 --> 00:01:08.866
I'm sorry about that.

31
00:01:08.866 --> 00:01:10.666
We take care of this business

32
00:01:10.666 --> 00:01:12.366
Temporarily uncooperative

33
00:01:12.733 --> 00:01:15.366
And this tobacco business?

34
00:01:15.366 --> 00:01:18.000
There is a commander-in-chief behind it

35
00:01:18.133 --> 00:01:21.666
What if the gang leader wants to do something wrong?

36
00:01:21.666 --> 00:01:25.033
I suggest you still weigh it carefully

37
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.200
You and I Lifei

38
00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.633
I hate that threat the most
