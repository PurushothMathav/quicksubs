00:00:00.566 --> 00:00:01.400
That's right.

2
00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:03.633
Tomorrow is the 6th.

3
00:00:03.733 --> 00:00:06.200
How about you accompany me to the City Lord's Mansion?

4
00:00:06.266 --> 00:00:07.833
City Lord's Mansion

5
00:00:08.266 --> 00:00:09.866
What are you doing in the City Lord's Mansion?

6
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.866
If you go, you will be late.

7
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.100
Meng Yun from the City Lord's Mansion smiled

8
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:16.566
But I've been thinking about you and you

9
00:00:16.766 --> 00:00:20.000
Smile, um, do you have a good relationship with the city lord?

10
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.000
I guess so.

11
00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:24.300
If you don't want to say it, forget it.

12
00:00:29.066 --> 00:00:29.766
madam

13
00:00:29.766 --> 00:00:32.033
I haven't seen you so happy for a long time

14
00:00:32.266 --> 00:00:35.000
Getting rid of Gu Beichen is naturally happy, by the way

15
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.433
Don't ever call me madam again

16
00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:37.666
Call me Miss Lin

17
00:00:37.666 --> 00:00:40.766
Okay, Miss Lin, that's right.

18
00:00:40.766 --> 00:00:42.800
What are we doing here today?

19
00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.066
Didn't you sell all your jewelry before?

20
00:00:45.066 --> 00:00:47.466
Do you want to buy it back?

21
00:00:47.466 --> 00:00:48.866
Of course not.

22
00:00:48.866 --> 00:00:50.400
Li Feiyu is going to the City Lord's Mansion

23
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:51.966
He wants me to go with him.

24
00:00:52.333 --> 00:00:54.166
I want to pick some gifts for Xiao Xiao

25
00:00:54.466 --> 00:00:57.700
By the way, redeem my jade bracelet and go

26
00:00:59.733 --> 00:01:02.500
Boss, I mortgaged the bracelet with you before.

27
00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.233
I want to redeem it now, sorry ma'am

28
00:01:05.366 --> 00:01:07.566
Your jade bracelet was bought by someone.

29
00:01:07.566 --> 00:01:08.400
What!

30
00:01:09.066 --> 00:01:10.100
Who bought it?

31
00:01:10.766 --> 00:01:12.600
I bought it.

32
00:01:12.733 --> 00:01:14.966
Gu Beichen, why are you here?
