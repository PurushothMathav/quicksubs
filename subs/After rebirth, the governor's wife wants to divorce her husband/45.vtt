00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.333
What am I afraid of?

2
00:00:01.333 --> 00:00:03.700
Gu Beichen, you know what you have done.

3
00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:05.433
The reason why I don't divorce you

4
00:00:05.533 --> 00:00:06.800
It's because of my own business

5
00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:08.166
It's not finished yet.

6
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.066
Very good Lin Junyu

7
00:00:11.766 --> 00:00:13.766
At the Commander-in-Chief's birthday party tomorrow

8
00:00:13.766 --> 00:00:16.033
I'll let the commander-in-chief judge then

9
00:00:16.866 --> 00:00:18.666
Close the door. Let's go

10
00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:23.000
Okay, I'll wait.

11
00:00:23.133 --> 00:00:27.000
Don't miss the Commander-in-Chief's birthday party tomorrow.

12
00:00:34.766 --> 00:00:36.600
You're going to have a showdown with them.

13
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.033
It's something you know

14
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:41.500
You will be known sooner or later

15
00:00:42.166 --> 00:00:42.966
Hey

16
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:45.966
Only tomorrow

17
00:00:46.333 --> 00:00:48.700
They thought they had a bright future

18
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.766
Will become

19
00:00:51.766 --> 00:00:54.000
The stuff of hell

20
00:00:54.566 --> 00:00:55.766
But madam

21
00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.066
We're not going home tonight

22
00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:59.566
Where can we go?

23
00:00:59.966 --> 00:01:01.566
That might have to

24
00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:03.700
Trouble help me

25
00:01:07.133 --> 00:01:08.300
My pleasure.

26
00:01:11.266 --> 00:01:12.233
I can hear you.

27
00:01:12.566 --> 00:01:13.466
You don't need to chase

28
00:01:21.666 --> 00:01:22.833
Isn't this close?

29
00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:24.500
Hear better

30
00:01:25.933 --> 00:01:27.033
Hey let go

31
00:01:27.166 --> 00:01:28.266
It's done.

32
00:01:28.266 --> 00:01:30.700
Can't you see me when I'm away from home every day?

33
00:01:31.333 --> 00:01:33.000
Afraid of people, I said I didn't do anything

34
00:01:33.066 --> 00:01:34.800
Hey, wait a minute.

35
00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.366
What orders does the princess have?

36
00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.533
Don't scream

37
00:01:38.533 --> 00:01:40.266
I like someone as upright as you

38
00:01:40.266 --> 00:01:41.400
I think you're a nice guy.

39
00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.466
Reward you 100 yuan of ocean

40
00:01:43.066 --> 00:01:44.066
Be serious

41
00:01:44.066 --> 00:01:45.466
I've always been serious

42
00:01:46.666 --> 00:01:47.400
You go on

43
00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:48.700
The person who didn't make a deal with love

44
00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:49.900
We've checked it out.

45
00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:51.466
When you arrive at Jingping City along the way

46
00:01:51.466 --> 00:01:52.866
We Yuhe Gang people

47
00:01:52.966 --> 00:01:54.500
It will be under control as soon as possible

48
00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:55.466
That's so great!

49
00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.233
Gu Beichen's love words are beautiful

50
00:01:58.366 --> 00:01:59.700
Playing with fire

51
00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.566
I'm talking about you.

52
00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.200
This Lin Jingying and others openly challenged me

53
00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:07.766
I will never forgive him

54
00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:10.966
Oh, Brother Beichen, don't be angry

55
00:02:10.966 --> 00:02:13.733
After our smoky road tomorrow night

56
00:02:13.733 --> 00:02:16.900
We can use the tobacco soil to master the entire boutique

57
00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.166
Liquor too

58
00:02:18.866 --> 00:02:20.666
Then the cigarette will be smoked

59
00:02:20.666 --> 00:02:23.366
Even the commander-in-chief has to see what I can do

60
00:02:24.766 --> 00:02:25.566
Let's go
