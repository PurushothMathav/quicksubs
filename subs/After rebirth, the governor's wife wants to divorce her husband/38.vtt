1
00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:03.966
What made me kneel down and apologize to him?

2
00:00:04.566 --> 00:00:06.800
Why don't you want to?

3
00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:08.666
This investment today

4
00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:10.600
Forget it, Dad

5
00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:12.800
Go away daddy daddy

6
00:00:12.966 --> 00:00:14.400
Please calm down

7
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.100
Please sit first

8
00:00:20.166 --> 00:00:20.966
Fat girl

9
00:00:21.566 --> 00:00:23.666
Why don't I go and apologize to the manager first?

10
00:00:23.966 --> 00:00:25.700
This tobacco business is mine

11
00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:27.066
The way is what I think

12
00:00:27.066 --> 00:00:28.866
Why should I apologize to them?

13
00:00:28.866 --> 00:00:30.166
I need the money.

14
00:00:30.166 --> 00:00:31.600
Otherwise, how do you do this business?

15
00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:32.866
I'll go, I'll go.

16
00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.900
Ah, I'm sorry, sister.

17
00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:37.866
Didn't you hear what I said?

18
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:39.600
kneel down

19
00:00:46.133 --> 00:00:49.000
Sister is sister, it was wrong before

20
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.633
I hope my sister will forgive me.

21
00:00:51.466 --> 00:00:54.033
If you are small, you must look small.

22
00:00:55.133 --> 00:00:56.033
Get up.

23
00:00:56.766 --> 00:00:58.033
Yes, sister.

24
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:01.200
Today's humiliation

25
00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.233
I will definitely pay it back

26
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:05.300
Dad

27
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.933
You see the money has arrived, right?

28
00:01:07.933 --> 00:01:09.933
Let's discuss the investment again

29
00:01:09.933 --> 00:01:11.566
Or forget the mortgage

30
00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:14.600
Beichen, how about you?

31
00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.766
I know my situation.

32
00:01:16.766 --> 00:01:19.233
If you are still Kim Pyongchen's lone army

33
00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:20.633
Then this mortgage

34
00:01:20.866 --> 00:01:23.100
We definitely don't want it.

35
00:01:23.466 --> 00:01:27.166
Look, you are not now.

36
00:01:27.866 --> 00:01:31.033
The figures along the way

37
00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:33.000
Although it gets better

38
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.366
But the stakes are high.

39
00:01:35.533 --> 00:01:38.700
I can't take 100,000 ocean

40
00:01:39.066 --> 00:01:40.866
Accompany you on an adventure

41
00:01:41.533 --> 00:01:42.566
That being the case

42
00:01:42.566 --> 00:01:43.900
What bottom do you want?

43
00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:47.566
Just take your Gu family's house and go

44
00:01:48.566 --> 00:01:49.600
What!
