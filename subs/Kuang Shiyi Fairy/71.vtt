00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.000
Bastard, how dare you curse my dad for having only 2,000 lives left

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.100
Stop for me

3
00:00:05.166 --> 00:00:09.066
Wang Biao caught a beast like his father

4
00:00:09.066 --> 00:00:10.766
Just beat him to death

5
00:00:10.766 --> 00:00:12.833
It is not a pity for such a person to die

6
00:00:13.066 --> 00:00:14.800
Let them go

7
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:16.100
Dad?

8
00:00:16.733 --> 00:00:20.900
Grandpa, isn't what I said clear enough?

9
00:00:21.166 --> 00:00:22.966
Let them go

10
00:00:23.066 --> 00:00:25.566
Old man, remember what I said

11
00:00:25.666 --> 00:00:27.366
If you want to find me for treatment

12
00:00:27.366 --> 00:00:29.066
Call your granddaughter

13
00:00:29.066 --> 00:00:29.866
antidote

14
00:00:30.466 --> 00:00:33.266
Tianyu, you go and arrange it.

15
00:00:33.566 --> 00:00:35.566
I'll go to the hospital for a check-up.

16
00:00:35.966 --> 00:00:39.033
Dad, how can you believe that kid?

17
00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:40.600
Are you feeling better?

18
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.166
Not sick at all

19
00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.500
Yes, grandpa.

20
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.533
Your body is the healthiest old man I have ever seen

21
00:00:46.533 --> 00:00:48.666
I'm going to the hospital for a check-up.

22
00:00:48.966 --> 00:00:50.166
You don't understand

23
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:51.433
Mr. Bai

24
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.266
If you just want a medical checkup

25
00:00:53.266 --> 00:00:54.300
I can arrange it.

26
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.666
And our dean happened to be here today

27
00:00:56.666 --> 00:00:58.700
I can have him check you in person.

28
00:01:03.466 --> 00:01:06.266
Sir, your body is very healthy

29
00:01:06.333 --> 00:01:08.433
If it weren't for the age written on it

30
00:01:08.566 --> 00:01:12.300
I find it hard to believe that you are already in your 70s

31
00:01:12.466 --> 00:01:16.200
It's no different from someone in their forties or fifties.

32
00:01:16.966 --> 00:01:18.233
I told you

33
00:01:18.333 --> 00:01:20.566
Grandpa's body is not sick at all

34
00:01:20.666 --> 00:01:22.566
Just the trash from supper

35
00:01:22.666 --> 00:01:24.700
He knows nothing about art supper

36
00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:27.800
How dare you curse Grandpa Bai with only two days left?

37
00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.200
You mustn't spoil him.

38
00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.266
Right?

39
00:01:30.566 --> 00:01:32.833
Or I'll find someone to catch him now
