00:00:01.666 --> 00:00:03.600
Dad, dad, what's the matter with you?

2
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.033
Dad, are you busy?

3
00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:06.866
Dad, what happened to my grandpa?

4
00:00:06.866 --> 00:00:07.766
Please help me

5
00:00:07.766 --> 00:00:09.900
Grandpa, I don't know what happened.

6
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.300
There is obviously no problem with the medical report of the dean

7
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:13.733
Why did you suddenly vomit blood?

8
00:00:13.733 --> 00:00:15.566
Yeah, it's weird.

9
00:00:15.733 --> 00:00:17.166
How could this be?

10
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.800
Is there a problem with a certain part of the physical examination?

11
00:00:20.933 --> 00:00:22.233
It should be so.

12
00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.600
I suggest a second medical examination for the old man

13
00:00:26.133 --> 00:00:27.700
This physical examination

14
00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:29.933
I will check it myself

15
00:00:29.933 --> 00:00:31.600
Great thank you dean

16
00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.400
Dad, do you hear me?

17
00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.066
The dean wants to personally withdraw the money for you

18
00:00:35.066 --> 00:00:38.366
You must be able to find out the reason for vomiting blood, mother

19
00:00:43.166 --> 00:00:44.300
Hey who should be careful

20
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.600
Ah, forget it, let me drive it

21
00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.400
Are you worried about your grandfather's condition?

22
00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:59.300
Don't worry.

23
00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.500
As long as he can come to me in the next two days

24
00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:02.600
You'll be okay.

25
00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:05.266
Can I lie to you?

26
00:01:07.266 --> 00:01:08.900
Okay, I'll take you somewhere

27
00:01:09.466 --> 00:01:11.433
See if you are in a good mood.
