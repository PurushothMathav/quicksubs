00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:02.000
This looks like a symptom of sudden aphasia

2
00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:04.000
Zhenwei, what is sudden aphasia?

3
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.400
Just suddenly unable to speak

4
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.366
How long will it take to speak again?

5
00:00:07.366 --> 00:00:08.800
If left untreated

6
00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.566
Probably won't be able to speak for the rest of my life

7
00:00:10.566 --> 00:00:13.700
Zhenwei, hurry up and save me, hurry up

8
00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.200
It's over, it's really a sudden aphasia

9
00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:19.800
To be sent to the hospital immediately for surgery

10
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.300
Dad, now is not the time to cry

11
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.966
Someone prepare the car

12
00:00:27.166 --> 00:00:29.133
You can send Qianyu to the hospital

13
00:00:29.133 --> 00:00:30.666
Just a little aphasia

14
00:00:30.666 --> 00:00:32.433
So nervous

15
00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:34.766
It's okay if you don't help at this time

16
00:00:34.766 --> 00:00:36.400
But still talking about the wind

17
00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:37.933
If my dad had an accident

18
00:00:37.933 --> 00:00:39.566
I will never let you go.

19
00:00:39.566 --> 00:00:41.233
Just amnesia

20
00:00:41.533 --> 00:00:43.433
It's not a serious illness.

21
00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.266
I can cure it casually

22
00:00:45.266 --> 00:00:47.566
Trash, are you delusional?

23
00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.600
What are you doing there again?

24
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.266
Shut up! You don't talk! No one treats you as a mute!

25
00:00:52.766 --> 00:00:55.166
I'll be promoted to vice president next month

26
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:55.933
Even I don't dare

27
00:00:55.933 --> 00:00:58.233
Amnesia that can be easily cured

28
00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.400
You're a piece of trash talking about it

29
00:01:00.566 --> 00:01:01.866
It's hilarious

30
00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:05.766
No, I can't wait to go to the hospital.

31
00:01:05.766 --> 00:01:06.933
Immediate surgery is required

32
00:01:06.933 --> 00:01:09.366
Otherwise, Uncle Bai will never be able to speak for the rest of his life
