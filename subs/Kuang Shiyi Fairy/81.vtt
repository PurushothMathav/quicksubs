00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:02.633
There is actually a medical skill that the seniors of the medical sage do not know

2
00:00:02.766 --> 00:00:04.733
I don't know the junior brother of the senior medical saint

3
00:00:04.733 --> 00:00:06.200
Where are you now

4
00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:09.166
Where is the junior brother of the senior medical saint now?

5
00:00:09.466 --> 00:00:11.300
We'll have someone take over right away

6
00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:13.833
The supper is the junior brother of the senior doctor

7
00:00:14.166 --> 00:00:15.100
and

8
00:00:15.166 --> 00:00:17.966
The reason why the senior doctor can come to see my grandfather

9
00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.200
It's because the supper was just given to the senior doctor

10
00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:21.266
Made a phone call

11
00:00:21.966 --> 00:00:23.466
Instead of Liao Zhenwei

12
00:00:23.966 --> 00:00:27.400
What supper is the younger brother of the doctor?

13
00:00:27.566 --> 00:00:28.866
It's snowing!

14
00:00:29.466 --> 00:00:33.666
You said that the supper is the junior brother of the senior doctor

15
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.633
Does he match?

16
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:40.533
Bah, if the supper is the junior brother of the senior medical saint

17
00:00:40.533 --> 00:00:43.366
Then I'm still the senior sister of the medical saint

18
00:00:43.566 --> 00:00:47.033
I admit that the senior medical saint was indeed not invited by me

19
00:00:47.133 --> 00:00:48.700
But it can't be a late night snack

20
00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:51.766
He is also the junior brother of the senior medical saint

21
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.366
Just laughed out loud

22
00:00:54.466 --> 00:00:56.766
I said supper junior brother

23
00:00:56.766 --> 00:00:59.200
It's like they don't believe you.

24
00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.733
Well, according to my temper

25
00:01:01.733 --> 00:01:03.666
Since you don't believe it

26
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.300
That's good, this disease

27
00:01:06.766 --> 00:01:08.433
Who loves to rule

28
00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.100
I die anyway

29
00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.400
I don't cure supper junior brother

30
00:01:12.933 --> 00:01:14.000
Give me back

31
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.200
Let's play a few games of chess

32
00:01:16.533 --> 00:01:19.966
Kill him in the dark, okay?
