00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.500
Hmph, it's just hilarious

2
00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:04.866
Do you know what I'm talking about?

3
00:00:04.866 --> 00:00:06.400
Supper you crazy

4
00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.766
Mr. Gao is an adult who doesn't remember villains

5
00:00:08.766 --> 00:00:09.900
Ready to let you go

6
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.466
What are you still doing here?

7
00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:13.300
Mr. Gao, don't be angry.

8
00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:14.466
He's a lunatic

9
00:00:14.466 --> 00:00:15.966
Humph stop

10
00:00:15.966 --> 00:00:17.300
Did I let you go?

11
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:19.333
The supper said you were a mad dog

12
00:00:19.333 --> 00:00:20.700
Are you really fucking?

13
00:00:20.733 --> 00:00:23.400
How can you rely on Fang Jiayi to support you?

14
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.900
Is Hu's Huwei here?

15
00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.066
If you dare to bark again

16
00:00:27.066 --> 00:00:28.600
Get out of there now

17
00:00:28.733 --> 00:00:30.000
This is a private matter between me and him

18
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.300
It has nothing to do with Senior Yama

19
00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.900
This powerful father listened to the panic you made

20
00:00:33.966 --> 00:00:35.700
If not for Senior Yama's presence

21
00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:36.800
Believe it or not this time

22
00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.700
You are already a corpse lying on the ground

23
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:39.400
Ponyo

24
00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.500
In a while, let Senior Yama not intervene and resign

25
00:00:41.566 --> 00:00:43.666
Okay, that's true.

26
00:00:43.666 --> 00:00:44.066
Don't date

27
00:00:44.066 --> 00:00:45.900
Your man lies there as a corpse

28
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:47.300
You were crying.

29
00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.333
I trust my man

30
00:00:49.333 --> 00:00:51.733
Hmph, that's what you said shouldn't be

31
00:00:51.733 --> 00:00:52.900
You have a minute.

32
00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:54.933
It only takes 10 seconds to scrap him

33
00:00:54.933 --> 00:00:56.566
Wait until you get scared

34
00:00:56.566 --> 00:00:59.600
You kneel on the ground now and kowtow ten times

35
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.500
I can also consider giving you a good time.

36
00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.200
I'm just afraid of getting the floor dirty

37
00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.766
Let's go out and hum
