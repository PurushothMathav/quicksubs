00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:02.800
Li Yao, how do you talk to your grandfather?

2
00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:04.066
No big or small

3
00:00:04.066 --> 00:00:05.400
Apologize to grandpa quickly

4
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.933
I just say what's on my mind

5
00:00:07.933 --> 00:00:09.466
Why apologize?

6
00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:11.800
Do you know why I saved him?

7
00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:13.400
Because he is Xueyao's uncle

8
00:00:13.533 --> 00:00:15.866
Even if Bai Tianyu wanted to poison Xueyao

9
00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:18.433
Xue Yao can't bear to do anything to him

10
00:00:18.566 --> 00:00:20.000
That's why I did it.

11
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.666
You are Xueyao's grandfather

12
00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.066
You let me and Xueyao leave now

13
00:00:24.133 --> 00:00:25.833
Don't make it difficult for Xueyao

14
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:27.600
I will also save you.

15
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.033
Dad, let your mother shit

16
00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:31.700
My dad is in great health

17
00:00:31.733 --> 00:00:32.933
Nothing to raise

18
00:00:32.933 --> 00:00:35.966
What's your heart, you trash?

19
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.600
I actually cursed my grandfather for being sick

20
00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.166
A villain like you

21
00:00:39.366 --> 00:00:41.066
The heart is more twisted than anyone else

22
00:00:41.066 --> 00:00:44.000
The old man wakes up every morning recently

23
00:00:44.066 --> 00:00:46.133
The heart goes down an inch

24
00:00:46.133 --> 00:00:47.933
Do you often have dull pain?

25
00:00:47.933 --> 00:00:49.500
Get up and drink some hot water

26
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.400
Can the symptoms be relieved or even subsided?

27
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:53.533
How do you know that?

28
00:00:53.533 --> 00:00:57.000
Anyway, only I can save your disease

29
00:00:57.366 --> 00:01:00.433
And you only have two days to live.

30
00:01:01.066 --> 00:01:02.600
If you want to live

31
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.300
Call Shenyang
