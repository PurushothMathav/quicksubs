1
00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:01.233
Say I poisoned

2
00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:02.833
Do you have any evidence?

3
00:00:03.666 --> 00:00:04.766
Yes!

4
00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:07.900
This is my poison

5
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:10.100
But I fell into the doctor's trap

6
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.666
So I poisoned it.

7
00:00:12.466 --> 00:00:14.300
I single-handedly blamed the disaster

8
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.500
The supper lied to me that it wasn't poison

9
00:00:16.533 --> 00:00:18.066
It was Grandpa's life-saving medicine.

10
00:00:18.166 --> 00:00:20.166
I'm trying to save Grandpa too.

11
00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:23.000
What else do you have to say about supper?

12
00:00:23.066 --> 00:00:25.066
I tried my best to save your father

13
00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:26.866
Even you question me, right?

14
00:00:31.266 --> 00:00:33.433
Long Wu said he knew, miss

15
00:00:45.966 --> 00:00:47.000
Dead

16
00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.000
That's a good extermination

17
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.366
Dead man
