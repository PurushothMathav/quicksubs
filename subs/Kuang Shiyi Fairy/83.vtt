00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:03.333
Ye Qiang, didn't the senior doctor say just now?

2
00:00:03.333 --> 00:00:05.833
Can your Xuanmen Nine Decades save Grandpa?

3
00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:08.200
He actually connected the Xuanmen Nine Expeditions

4
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.200
Is there no way?

5
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.433
If only Xuanmen Jiu Zheng could have been saved 10 minutes ago

6
00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:15.966
But it's over now.

7
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.600
I'm done

8
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.233
If you don't save, you won't save.

9
00:00:20.666 --> 00:00:24.000
I'm being mysterious here

10
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.200
What about the medical holy wetland?

11
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.366
I think it's just a false name

12
00:00:29.733 --> 00:00:30.533
supper

13
00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:33.666
I seriously doubt your reputation as a doctor wetland

14
00:00:33.766 --> 00:00:35.566
Did you pay for it?

15
00:00:35.566 --> 00:00:36.900
What's your hurry?

16
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:38.966
I said Xuanmen Jiuzhen can't be saved

17
00:00:38.966 --> 00:00:41.400
I didn't say I couldn't save the half-grandfather

18
00:00:41.566 --> 00:00:42.366
supper

19
00:00:43.333 --> 00:00:44.900
What can you do to save grandpa?

20
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.800
I need the blood of the white man

21
00:00:47.933 --> 00:00:50.166
People in Paihe seek truth

22
00:00:50.366 --> 00:00:51.800
Wake up the white old man

23
00:00:52.166 --> 00:00:54.266
In this way, Mr. Bai is the most helpful

24
00:00:54.466 --> 00:00:58.033
Wonderful, Myota Zhen wakes up

25
00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:03.633
Haha, Mr. Bai's illness has been completely saved.

26
00:01:04.866 --> 00:01:06.366
Must use

27
00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:08.133
Bai Jianding's blood?

28
00:01:08.133 --> 00:01:10.800
I'm not in good health these two days.

29
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.966
And I'm anemic.

30
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.700
Tell the old man that I can't save my blood

31
00:01:16.933 --> 00:01:18.433
I'm not dead either

32
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.633
My senior brother and I can't die here.

33
00:01:23.066 --> 00:01:23.933
I have something else to do

34
00:01:23.933 --> 00:01:26.100
I'll go first
