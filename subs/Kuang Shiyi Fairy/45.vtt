00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.766
Culture, don't you understand?

2
00:00:01.766 --> 00:00:03.800
My wife has said twice not to sign

3
00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:05.866
Xiaoye Lao Tzu advises you to mind your own business

4
00:00:05.866 --> 00:00:07.400
Otherwise it will be very miserable

5
00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.600
Get out of here, I won't eat your set

6
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:10.966
You boy

7
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.100
You have thin arms and legs

8
00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:17.000
I advise you not to waste your time

9
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.700
Xiaoye, wait for me.

10
00:00:19.933 --> 00:00:21.600
Today's business is not over

11
00:00:21.666 --> 00:00:23.033
And you Jacky Cheung

12
00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:24.333
You are grown up now

13
00:00:24.333 --> 00:00:25.733
Are the wings hard?

14
00:00:25.733 --> 00:00:28.000
Did you not even listen to your uncle?

15
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.966
You have to sign this contract today

16
00:00:30.966 --> 00:00:32.500
If you don't sign, you have to sign

17
00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.200
Xueyao, what's the matter with you?

18
00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.000
I heard from your uncle that you don't even listen to him.

19
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.033
What do you want?

20
00:00:40.266 --> 00:00:41.800
It turned out to be the waste of supper

21
00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.100
I'll give you advice here.

22
00:00:43.133 --> 00:00:45.300
Xueyao, I want you to fire him immediately

23
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.600
Then divorce him

24
00:00:47.366 --> 00:00:50.766
Ma, I won't fire supper for no reason

25
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.100
Not to mention divorce

26
00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.300
It's the other way around. You're the other way around.

27
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.000
I'm going to ask you one last time.

28
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.466
Are you going to let him go?

29
00:00:57.466 --> 00:00:58.800
Will you divorce him?

30
00:00:59.133 --> 00:01:02.066
Neither fired nor divorced

31
00:01:02.066 --> 00:01:04.366
You won't let him go or divorce him, will you?

32
00:01:04.366 --> 00:01:07.000
Well, then you can stop being the president now.

33
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.900
You can live with this poor boy for the rest of your life

34
00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:10.100
I am now in the group.

35
00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:11.933
The identity of the shareholder is officially notified to you

36
00:01:11.933 --> 00:01:14.000
You're fired.
