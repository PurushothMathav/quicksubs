00:00:00.966 --> 00:00:03.066
I had this jade pendant with me before I knocked out

2
00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:04.866
When I woke up, the jade pendant was gone

3
00:00:04.866 --> 00:00:06.366
It must have been stolen by you.

4
00:00:06.366 --> 00:00:07.166
Tang Xueyao

5
00:00:07.166 --> 00:00:09.966
Don't wrong me, I didn't even touch your jade pendant

6
00:00:09.966 --> 00:00:12.700
Hmph, look at you beggar

7
00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:14.766
It must have been when my Xueyao was in a coma

8
00:00:14.766 --> 00:00:16.133
You stole it

9
00:00:16.133 --> 00:00:18.500
Someone come and search for him for me

10
00:00:19.666 --> 00:00:22.233
Just you white-eyed wolf gave it to my brother

11
00:00:23.533 --> 00:00:24.866
This is a marriage contract

12
00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.566
I will return the marriage to the Zhang family first.

13
00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:30.500
I will retire first

14
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.166
Who are you calling a white-eyed wolf?

15
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:35.500
You, of course.

16
00:00:35.733 --> 00:00:37.666
It's okay if I'm not grateful for saving you

17
00:00:37.666 --> 00:00:39.100
Stabbed me with a knife

18
00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:40.900
What are you not a white-eyed wolf?

19
00:00:43.266 --> 00:00:44.900
OK, let it go.

20
00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:45.966
Don't be angry with this rubbish

21
00:00:45.966 --> 00:00:47.366
Not worth Ye Xiao

22
00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.200
Don't you just think I cut your finger?

23
00:00:50.533 --> 00:00:53.633
I'll pay you back now. We don't owe each other

24
00:00:57.533 --> 00:00:58.466
people care
