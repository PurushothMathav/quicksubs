00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:03.333
Grandpa, he was always a soft rice eater

2
00:00:03.333 --> 00:00:05.100
Divorce comes sooner or later

3
00:00:05.533 --> 00:00:07.566
Is that all there is to it?

4
00:00:07.566 --> 00:00:10.266
Is it too cheap for him?

5
00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:12.166
He just slapped me in the face

6
00:00:12.333 --> 00:00:13.900
I want him to kneel and apologize

7
00:00:14.166 --> 00:00:16.000
Shut up ouch

8
00:00:17.266 --> 00:00:18.866
You have to think about it

9
00:00:18.866 --> 00:00:21.266
As long as you promise to divorce the supper

10
00:00:21.366 --> 00:00:24.133
Today is over

11
00:00:24.133 --> 00:00:27.433
You can both leave the Bai family safely

12
00:00:27.533 --> 00:00:29.300
Tiger supper

13
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.400
You can't leave today

14
00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.400
Grandpa, I will not divorce the supper

15
00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.400
As long as you're talking nonsense, I'm not talking nonsense about you.

16
00:00:39.466 --> 00:00:41.800
Oops, I'm pissed off.

17
00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.966
You don't divorce the supper today

18
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.133
I can't leave tonight for supper.

19
00:00:46.133 --> 00:00:47.700
I can't go for supper.

20
00:00:48.366 --> 00:00:50.766
I'm not going either

21
00:00:51.066 --> 00:00:54.800
Very good, Xueyao, Xueyao

22
00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.500
You've really grown up.

23
00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:59.500
The wings are hard

24
00:00:59.766 --> 00:01:03.833
You don't even listen to the old man's words?

25
00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:06.300
I grew up doing this.

26
00:01:06.566 --> 00:01:08.966
I'm hurting you for nothing

27
00:01:08.966 --> 00:01:11.566
Grandpa, why do you have to

28
00:01:11.566 --> 00:01:13.266
Forcing me to divorce the supper

29
00:01:13.266 --> 00:01:15.866
I'm doing this for your own good.

30
00:01:16.066 --> 00:01:18.300
Good for me good for me

31
00:01:18.333 --> 00:01:20.333
You all say it's for my own good

32
00:01:20.333 --> 00:01:22.700
But do you know what I want?

33
00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:23.500
grandfather

34
00:01:24.133 --> 00:01:25.766
Please stop using your old friends

35
00:01:25.766 --> 00:01:28.266
A set of ideas to impose on me

36
00:01:28.533 --> 00:01:30.866
Your set is long outdated

37
00:01:30.966 --> 00:01:32.766
Ah, I don't like it.

38
00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:34.266
Don't need it either
