1
00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:04.520
I'll sleep here tonight.

2
00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:06.540
I can sleep in the car.

3
00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:09.480
This car is too small.

4
00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.780
I sleep if

5
00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:13.980
If you don't mind.

6
00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:15.620
I slept in bed.

7
00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:18.040
You set the floor.

8
00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:20.180
Go wash your face first.

9
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:22.400
Okay.

10
00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.420
You've died eight times.

11
00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:37.660
Oh, this broken game still has some bugs that have not been fixed.

12
00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:38.800
Is it bothering you?

13
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.380
I'll turn off my voice.

14
00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.900
How do you design maybe a broken game?

15
00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.380
Don't you think playing games all day isn't the right thing to do?

16
00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:49.420
It's a very developed industry.

17
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.560
Last year, our country's biogas industry broke 300 billion.

18
00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:55.940
The future will only be more prosperous and developed.

19
00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:56.920
I hope.

20
00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.760
You can do what you are good at and love.

21
00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.740
That way you can shine.

22
00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:04.260
The world is beautiful and vibrant

23
00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.180
Okay, the moisture on the floor is too heavy to sleep in.

24
00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.740
There's some mold.

25
00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.500
So we sleep separately.

26
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:13.940
Well water does not violate river water

27
00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.180
What the hell can this thing stop?

28
00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:20.300
Go to sleep. I'm tired.

29
00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.120
Where is my physiological period?

30
00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:23.220
Don't think too much.

31
00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.540
How to sleep like a pig
