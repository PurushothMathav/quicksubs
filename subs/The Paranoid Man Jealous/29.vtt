00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:05.780
I used to be biased against you.

2
00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:08.900
Maybe you're not what I thought you were

3
00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:10.820
What do you imagine?

4
00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:13.700
frivolous and vicious

5
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:14.900
Small belly chicken intestines

6
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.140
You really don't know what kind of woman I am

7
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:21.740
You don't know.

8
00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:24.740
I've been in love with you since I was 18

9
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:26.980
You don't even know

10
00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:29.260
I also play the piano

11
00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:30.940
Can draw

12
00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:33.740
Good cooking

13
00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:36.980
When you are drunk

14
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.620
I will cook the fishy wine soup for you by myself.

15
00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.820
Every shirt of yours is ironed by me

16
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.860
These are all the sacrifices of the original owner.

17
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.060
You didn't know how to cherish when you loved you before

18
00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.180
You can take it back at will when you want it back now.

19
00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.380
I, Qu Yan, are not an item

20
00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:01.060
Fu Tingchuan

21
00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.380
What you're saying now makes sense

22
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.000
How could it be meaningless?

23
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.980
Qu Yan, I never really wanted to know you before

24
00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.160
Shall we start over?

25
00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.899
Give each other a chance to get to know each other, okay?

26
00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:15.260
late

27
00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.180
Not too late

28
00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.880
We are not officially divorced yet.

29
00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:20.700
We are still a legitimate couple

30
00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:22.780
You try again.

31
00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:23.720
Can you try it once?

32
00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:25.160
Just once just once

33
00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.932
You let me go

34
00:01:25.932 --> 00:01:27.100
You're hurting me.

35
00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:30.180


36
00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.399
Sorry, I

37
00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.966
our

38
00:01:31.966 --> 00:01:36.900
Do I start my first date tomorrow?

39
00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.220
I'll take you to the best western restaurant in town

40
00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.940
Why can't this person understand human language?

41
00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:45.780
What should I do if Xiao Qi scum starts chasing his wife crematorium?

42
00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.260
Let's talk tomorrow

43
00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.640
You go back first, I'm going to rest.

44
00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.500
OK, then you have a good rest first

45
00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:53.940
I'll pick you up at noon tomorrow.

46
00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.500
The charm of the host is too great

47
00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:01.440
It's been so long

48
00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:02.780
What are you talking about?

49
00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:05.780
If Fu Tingchuan dares to spend the night, I will
