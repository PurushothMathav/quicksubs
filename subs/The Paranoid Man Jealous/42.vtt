00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:06.060
Oh, these two kids are running out whispering.

2
00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:07.400
As I see it.

3
00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:10.600
It should have been their wedding a long time ago.

4
00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:12.860
I'm going to find someone to watch the day tomorrow.

5
00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:15.760
Try to get married next month.

6
00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:19.700
I can hug my grandson next year.

7
00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:24.320
brother

8
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.860
It's about marriage.

9
00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.620
I have to see what the two of them think.

10
00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:33.240
Mom.

11
00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.380
I want to kiss the promise.

12
00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:38.200
What's wrong with you two?

13
00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.940
Isn't it fun to get engaged?

14
00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.300
No, our house doesn't have that many ideas.

15
00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.860
Did you get beaten up by the wild man outside?

16
00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.220
Mrs Phong.

17
00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.060
Pay attention to your words.

18
00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:54.740
This marriage...

19
00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:57.580
Your son wants to cancel.

20
00:00:58.720 --> 00:00:59.520
Aunty.

21
00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:02.020
I've got something to show you.

22
00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:04.980
Ok, don't worry.

23
00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:06.360
I'm going with you today.

24
00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.460
We ended the engagement.

25
00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:09.940
You don't have to worry about people saying you're a lover anymore.

26
00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:11.880
I'll definitely give you the money.

27
00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.340
Understand the East as a person with a marriage contract

28
00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.420
Don't know who you want a girlfriend for?
