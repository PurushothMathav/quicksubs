00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:04.440
How is 20?

2
00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:05.580
Got shot

3
00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.100
Probably won't die

4
00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:10.460
Boss Shen

5
00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.780
Do you feel like 20 is injured and can't work for your recovery?

6
00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:16.020
They didn't show up.

7
00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:18.740
Isn't it obvious?

8
00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:20.360
Although he didn't hurt his face

9
00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:22.080
But at least give treatment

10
00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.760
Can he serve other guests?

11
00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.520
I was going to have him offer you overnight service

12
00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:29.060
He can serve other rich women

13
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.620
Who knows how to make costumes on this show?

14
00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.020
He quit

15
00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:34.040
resign

16
00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:36.220
How much liquidated damages are required?

17
00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:37.940
I'll pay for it.

18
00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:41.700
Miss Xu meant to pick up the car for Shi

19
00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:43.660
His liquidated damages are very high.

20
00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:45.820
Quote me a price

21
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:51.600
Chi

22
00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.540
What did the doctor say?

23
00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:57.780
That's painful.

24
00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.180
Why am I okay? He's okay.
