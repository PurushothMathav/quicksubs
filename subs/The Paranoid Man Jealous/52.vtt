00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:04.520
What's wrong, is there something I can't find?

2
00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:07.220
It's okay, it's just health care products bought for my mother-in-law.

3
00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:08.280
Not found.

4
00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:09.700
I left it at the hotel.

5
00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:11.700
I drove down the mountain to get it.

6
00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:15.580
The mountain road is dangerous, I'll see you off.

7
00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:18.120
Come in.

8
00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:23.520
Rainy day for tourists

9
00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:24.980
I called my mother-in-law.

10
00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.460
We'll be back tomorrow.

11
00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:29.560
Hello, is there a room available now?

12
00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:31.640
There is an empty room, but only one room.

13
00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:32.880
If not, you can wait and see.

14
00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.100
Other guests may check out later.

15
00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.940
I can only leave my brother first.
