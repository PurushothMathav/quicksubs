00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:05.500
Why don t you wait for me to cut the cake?

2
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.500
Maybe, just cut the birthday cake, it's almost 9 o'clock.

3
00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:16.660
Shuyuan, I'm sorry.

4
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.300
I'm looking for someone to give you a birthday present.

5
00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:20.380
Happy birthday.

6
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.820
Who is this woman?

7
00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.020
I want to wait for nature to flourish and then act.

8
00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:31.260
Now it looks like it needs to be done first.

9
00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.820
Number 19 forward transfer system.

10
00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:39.320
Don't move.

11
00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:43.520
Stop chasing.

12
00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:45.860
We're not in time.

13
00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.140
Security officer.

14
00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:53.340
You have a way to plant and dense, I'll try.

15
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.820
Come here.

16
00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.460
Xiao Qi, help me set the time for the USB to turn on a little longer.

17
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.100
Just three minutes.

18
00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.660
Server, what are you doing?

19
00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.620
Of course, a big gift for the code thief.

20
00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.740
This is a typical gray pigeon environment.

21
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.380
Just plug the USB in.

22
00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.620
The computer will automatically run and fill.

23
00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.780
Your computer will have a blue screen.

24
00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:34.700
How do you know someone stole the code tonight?
