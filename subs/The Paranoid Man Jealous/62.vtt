00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:03.620
I heard you broke up with Kauno.

2
00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:05.520
He gave your family some projects.

3
00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.260
I have 20 million.

4
00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:09.900
You take it, leave it.

5
00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:12.920
Thank you, ma'am, I'm here.

6
00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:16.380
There's a 60 million investment contract.

7
00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:23.120
You invest in a gaming company.

8
00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:24.440
You marry family.

9
00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:26.180
This isn't about us marrying our families.

10
00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:29.280
Thank you if you want to beat me with money.

11
00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:32.740
So if that's not the case, I'll give you ten times the amount of Thanksgiving.

12
00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:35.460
Please support the dream of nature.

13
00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.820
Two hundred million hectares

14
00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.520
You take the money out first.

15
00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:41.020
Of course I have money.

16
00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:44.180
But how can I confirm?

17
00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.140
Shea won't back down.

18
00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.820
You take out 200 million.

19
00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:50.860
What about I promise?

20
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.060
This is my personal account.

21
00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.620
You can see something, right?

22
00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:57.820
You're young.

23
00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.360
Sending this much cash.

24
00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.620
This doesn't bother rich people to thank for caring anymore.

25
00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.500
I will transfer the money to A Nhien's personal account.

26
00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.240
It's a free gift for you to remove your armor.

27
00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:09.080
I don't need any terms of agreement either.

28
00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.260
Just thank the rich and remember what you promised me.

29
00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:17.200
This is a money order.

30
00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:18.320
Let you see it first.

31
00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:19.340
No need to see it.

32
00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.340
If you are too generous

33
00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.260
Looks like I'm stingy.

34
00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:27.560
Ownership is great.

35
00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.740
Money is tough.

36
00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:32.980
That's right, seven.

37
00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:36.460
I recently asked you to help me stare at the Clerk Yuan.

38
00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:37.580
What's going to happen?
