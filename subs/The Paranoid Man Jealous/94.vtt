Please dial again later

3
00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:12.100
Sorry, the user you dialed is temporarily unavailable.

4
00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:20.460
Hey, it's gone. Help me check the loophole.

5
00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:22.520
We had a fight.

6
00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:24.240
Why don't you check that the road conditions are so serious?

7
00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.420
He didn't quarrel, he left by himself

8
00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.740
It's not good, it's immoral, you can go to a shelf for you first.

9
00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:34.500
Make it clear.

10
00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.400
According to the road control downstairs of your apartment

11
00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.440
Take a cigarette and go out with a suitcase, and be picked up by the goods and picked up by the car

12
00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.260
The car drives all the way to the shelf

13
00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:42.820
Come pick me up now

14
00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.420
Right now.

15
00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:55.360
Oops

16
00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.140
I know what you're up to

17
00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:02.860
You all hope that Qu Lili can have a healthy body

18
00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:05.180
But what's wrong with me?

19
00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.220
I didn't cause his

20
00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.920
gorgeous

21
00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:10.740
Sorry.

22
00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.740
I didn't expect marrying someone to be so selfish

23
00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.180
Don't worry.

24
00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.060
I won't be too hard on you.

25
00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.500
I know it's because you can't control your heart

26
00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:23.820
How do you know that?

27
00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.140
Do you feel that you are uncontrollably in love with spiritual power?

28
00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:30.540
But with more and more understanding

29
00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.620
You have been disappointed

30
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.700
But you can't be disappointed

31
00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.940
Once your love for him wears off a bit

32
00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.100
You have to make up for that love in time

33
00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:43.100
That's it.

34
00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.220
This damn plot

35
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:48.820
little brother

36
00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.620
Is this your own determined heart?

37
00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:52.620
Don't be afraid.

38
00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:54.340
You can

39
00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:56.040
OK

40
00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:58.020
Have a drink
