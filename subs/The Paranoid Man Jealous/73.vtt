00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.440
Hello, do I have a shift the night after tomorrow?

2
00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.000
I pay three times the appearance fee

3
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.120
Then I will attend a party

4
00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:11.740
Yeah, the day after tomorrow.

5
00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:13.180
Uh uh

6
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:15.420
I'll reply to you later.

7
00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.220
You asked me to find information on that girl

8
00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:26.220
Said that the girl who was drunk in our factory last time was Xu Yan

9
00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.880
Brother is awesome

10
00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.540
Study fiancee

11
00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.660
Make it clear.

12
00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:34.720
Here is the information for making a wish

13
00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:36.220
Haichen marries a family

14
00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:39.580
His fiancÃ©'s name is Huo Chengze

15
00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.520
Is the heir to the Huo Group

16
00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.540
It is said that Huo Chengze likes the true scriptures of this composer who has just recognized his ancestors and returned to the sect

17
00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:51.780
But Qu Yan was also confirmed that he was not the biological daughter of the Qu family

18
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.780
But the composer didn't mean to drive him away

19
00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:55.980
I don't know what the secret is.

20
00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.560
If you go to your clubhouse to get a cigarette and ask me

21
00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:03.420
Just tell him about me

22
00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.380
Only accompany wine, not introduce

23
00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.360
Going out for the night with him was also the first time

24
00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.520
First time coming out?

25
00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.160
I'm late, I really believe it's your first time.

26
00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.620
But why are you explaining it to him?

27
00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.620
He thinks you are unwilling to eat

28
00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:20.980
So much nonsense

29
00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:26.900
No shift the night after tomorrow

30
00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:28.700
Time for you
