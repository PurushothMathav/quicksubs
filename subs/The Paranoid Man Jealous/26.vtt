00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:00.960
No, Si Yan

2
00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:01.920
That's not true.

3
00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:03.320
This is all a trap set by Qu Yan

4
00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:06.140
Did he deliberately lead me to say that?

5
00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.100
I deliberately induced you

6
00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:12.540
So I lured you from the rich to the slums in the past?

7
00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.300
Then you hired kidnappers to kidnap me. I also arranged it.

8
00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:18.880
You are as clean as a white lotus

9
00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:20.500
Didn't do anything bad

10
00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:22.100
Is that so?

11
00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:24.900
Si Yan, I'm sorry.

12
00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.100
I beg you I beg you for the love we grew up with

13
00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:30.920
For the sake of the Mu family

14
00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:32.620
Please forgive me this time

15
00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.580
I just love you so much

16
00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:35.400
Si Yan

17
00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.960
I beg you.

18
00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:37.599
Si Yan

19
00:00:37.599 --> 00:00:38.900
I beg you.

20
00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.380
You are really a fresh trick to eat all over the sky

21
00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:45.140
What do you want me to do with him?

22
00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.740
He is the little green plum you grew up with

23
00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.700
What if I hit you hard and your heart hurts?

24
00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:52.799
Take Miss Mu to the police station

25
00:00:52.799 --> 00:00:53.200


26
00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.400
What other crime?

27
00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.940
Tell him to talk to the police.

28
00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:57.433
You let go

29
00:00:57.433 --> 00:00:58.260
Si Yan

30
00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:58.866
Take away.

31
00:00:58.866 --> 00:01:00.640
Don't be fooled by this woman

32
00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.140
He's not a normal person

33
00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:09.660
Are you uncomfortable?

34
00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.332
The girl who has protected her for so many years

35
00:01:12.332 --> 00:01:14.200
It's actually a snake venom heart

36
00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.500
The kind helping hand of the year sent charcoal in a hurry

37
00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.040
That little bit of warmth is fake

38
00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.660
You must be disappointed

39
00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.520
If only I had shown up earlier

40
00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.400
I will never let you be so lonely

41
00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.240
I will accompany you through hard times

42
00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:30.320
Cook for you

43
00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.340
If you get hurt in a fight, I will apply medicine and bandage you.

44
00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:36.380
If you're not happy, I'll tell you a joke

45
00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:49.220
I'm late.
