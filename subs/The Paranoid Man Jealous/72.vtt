00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:03.260
Grandpa, you are back.

2
00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.580
Grandpa, where were you last night?

3
00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.460
Why don't you call home?

4
00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:10.360
Do you know how worried your mother is about you?

5
00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:14.240
I went out to drink with friends last night and slept in the hotel after drinking too much

6
00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:17.140
Do you know how harmful drinking can be?

7
00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:19.100
If you like to play with friends

8
00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:20.620
Come to the house for a party

9
00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:22.240
Mom is ready for you?

10
00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.780
Hmph, I'm afraid I'll drink and hurt my body

11
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.100
Are you afraid of hurting Qu Lili's backup kidney source?

12
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.780
You didn't sleep well when you were drunk last night, did you?

13
00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:34.060
Go upstairs and get some sleep

14
00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.580
Come down and drink a bowl of bird's nest later

15
00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:39.940
Mom, let the servant prepare it for you.

16
00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.980
Yanyan, why didn't you answer my call last night?

17
00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:53.580
Don't get me wrong.

18
00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:55.660
There's really nothing between me and Lily

19
00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.500
Please reply to me when you get home.

20
00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.340
I've only been home a few minutes

21
00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.340
The news is really coming

22
00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.260
Hello? Do you have a shift the night after tomorrow?

23
00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.460
I pay three times the appearance fee
