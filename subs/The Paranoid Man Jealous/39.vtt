00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:02.540
Mom.

2
00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:07.660
There's something I'd like to talk to you about.

3
00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.100
After I die.

4
00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:15.620
Pour my ashes into the sea.

5
00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:18.300
Okay?

6
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:22.980
But you say I'm stubborn

7
00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:26.820
Don't look for another woman.

8
00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.180
He doesn't regret it now.

9
00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:33.700
But after I died

10
00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.660
You must find one.

11
00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:41.780
Very good for you, very good, good woman with you.

12
00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.740
Who do you think you are?

13
00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.820
Why are you manipulating my life?

14
00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:00.420
Don't be angry.

15
00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.180
I just want it when I'm gone.

16
00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:07.380
You're not alone.

17
00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:11.180
Then don't go.

18
00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:14.020
Can you stay with me?

19
00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:15.940
If possible

20
00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:17.740
I want to stay too.

21
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.100
Does it hurt?

22
00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.380
You were most afraid of pain.

23
00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:27.980
It doesn't hurt.

24
00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.460
Can you give me the lipstick?

25
00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:38.420
I'll give you flowers.

26
00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.260
Are we ugly now?

27
00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:03.100
Not ugly.

28
00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:05.460
My baby is the most beautiful.
