00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:07.150
You are willing to eat and you are willing to eat. Now that you know that we are talking about marriage,

2
00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:10.260
The oily feet were gone, Kaishan chased her affectionately,

3
00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:12.130
Talk!

4
00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:16.170
I'll teach you how to teach Yang Buyanyan

5
00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:17.410
I'm not saying it's good

6
00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:18.310
don't call me

7
00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:30.280
I listen to this and listen to the singing

8
00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:32.460
The face is completely different

9
00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:34.200
Are you still with these?

10
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.200
immortal individual

11
00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:37.110
What's mixed in?

12
00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:39.970
Will you respond to the rest of the year? Right?

13
00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:44.190
Are you still willing to do it in the remaining years?

14
00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:47.050
What is the remaining annual leave if

15
00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:49.200
let me know again

16
00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:53.380
If you're looking for trouble with Mianmian, then that's it

17
00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:55.210
You disappear

18
00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:56.410
Don't be like here

19
00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:11.400
Goodbye, go down. Close your eyes and be well.

20
00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.780
I'm sure I'm not angry either

21
00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.840
He wants to suffer but does not want to be exposed

22
00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:22.120
Don't even think about going back to my house.

23
00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:29.650
What do you want to say?

24
00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.960
I'm not happy either. It's my fault.

25
00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:46.780
You don’t have to worry, sir, you’re responsible for the rich

26
00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:49.490
Since I have so much wealth, I am dead

27
00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:51.400
Give you seven days

28
00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:09.220
What is bankruptcy? Don’t you always open a bottle of wine?
