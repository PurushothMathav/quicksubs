1
00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:03.180
The vice president knows the sentence.

2
00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:04.550
Well, no.

3
00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:07.370
Mr. Wan was joking.

4
00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:08.340
I'm just a cleaner.

5
00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:10.140
I know the vice president.

6
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.160
I was still thinking about saying that the vice president agreed.

7
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.120
They all only like Ms. Yanyu’s style.

8
00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:16.730
Thinking about gentlemen, not everyone loves them.

9
00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:18.210
Since you don't thank you.

10
00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:19.570
Then I'll thank you.

11
00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:22.080
A list for Miss Judgment.

12
00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:23.930
But I don’t want to talk about it.

13
00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:30.210
When Qingyiyi comes out, he comes to pick up the guests.

14
00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:31.960
What a love.

15
00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:34.570
The vice president doesn't want me.

16
00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:36.370
Of course I want to give it to others as a gift.

17
00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:45.310
Why are you so nervous? Just tell me

18
00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:48.750
Is independent health right?

19
00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.630
Don't go it seems

20
00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:53.740
It's not like I actually watch the show.

21
00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:57.060
Like getting married independently and healthily

22
00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:58.340
I'll definitely take care of him

23
00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:00.360
Unless this one

24
00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:04.500
If I am independent and healthy

25
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:05.280
Come and visit Miss Penny

26
00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.260
Such a beautiful beauty

27
00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.520
I will definitely take it with me every day

28
00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:09.780
I can walk out laughing

29
00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:11.940
How can you be so angry?

30
00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.510
That's not all. Miss Fan, please come more. Is Xiao okay?

31
00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:24.450
I will definitely go and catch up

32
00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:42.240
Cut this off half the time

33
00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:43.680
That design collaboration

34
00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.880
Yes, this is what greeting gas is

35
00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:47.770
Look what you said

36
00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:49.900
Like this, just write a method

37
00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:51.100
We'll come if we've been here before

38
00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:01.370
Don't write a law

39
00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:04.260
this is your company

40
00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:05.850
What are you doing in here?

41
00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.680
And you are willing

42
00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:12.120
You just follow you

43
00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:14.280
Now as said

44
00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.950
Isn't it just for money?

45
00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:19.590
I hit it myself

46
00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:23.870
But it's easy to say

47
00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:27.280
This way you seem to have a good time

48
00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.160
So where are our family’s millions in business expenses?

49
00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:30.000
Not selfish

50
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.760
Don't forget

51
00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:47.180
Are you sure you want to be here

52
00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.570
Do other things like this

53
00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:58.060
Finally got over the fee

54
00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:59.890
I shouldn't think about it

55
00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:00.870
It won't fall anymore

56
00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:03.560
I told you everything

57
00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:06.990
You keep talking about husband

58
00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:08.330
you have to choose me

59
00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:14.400
Is it you who doesn’t want to worry about the other person?

60
00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.000
This kind of male waypoint

61
00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:24.080
And I gave you a trick

62
00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.170
Han and Tibetans never got married

63
00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:30.100
These are all emotional

64
00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:35.230
If you have a personality, this is

65
00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:37.560
I'm good

66
00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:38.880
It's up to you
