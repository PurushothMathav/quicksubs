00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:04.540
How come you are so far away?

2
00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:06.200
I obviously know that's the case

3
00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:07.980
Why did you listen to her?

4
00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:09.980
Still so sad

5
00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:11.440
I just soaked my feet and saw it

6
00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:12.630
How come it's right?

7
00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:13.670
By the way, she sent music

8
00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:16.520
Now that someone is taking care of me

9
00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:17.850
What if something happens?

10
00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.030
I gave it to you

11
00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:19.690
Are you

12
00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:32.910
This is a meeting

13
00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.610
Don't think I don't know what you want to do

14
00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:37.250
Yeon Sung Ge Actually, you can laugh at the person you think about

15
00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:38.830
you misunderstood

16
00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:40.210
I'll send the vice president some music

17
00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.710
Itâ€™s really the back of the foot soak.

18
00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:44.090
What does the world look like?

19
00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:45.730
There are so many empty feet

20
00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:47.890
Because I'm not your dream

21
00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:51.150
Why would he look at you so hotly with you?

22
00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.840
You're not going to take a nap

23
00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:56.580
If it were like ours

24
00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:57.800
Better to stay

25
00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:01.610
The first year of high school is the last one, and I will definitely be there in the third year.

26
00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:03.610
This sentence should be given to you, right?

27
00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:05.730
After all, the vice president is still married

28
00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:07.700
Don't come up to this mistress
