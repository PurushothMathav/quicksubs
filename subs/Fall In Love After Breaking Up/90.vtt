00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:06.470
Vice President, I mean we are leaving,

2
00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:08.310
How could I photograph you?

3
00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:11.530
Boss, I won’t bother Cheng to say,

4
00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:13.350
Are you my husband looking at me like this?

5
00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:15.250
You asked me to pretend to be in charge of his husband,

6
00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.160
How did I kill this product?

7
00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:22.920
Ah, like that, the faces that open their eyes and pat each other are full of emotions,

8
00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.520
If I had said that, would I still be able to get out alive today?

9
00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:34.140
Well, it doesn’t look like it, I haven’t had anything to do with you for a long time,

10
00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:39.900
No, no, no for a long time, one year

11
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:48.700
It is indeed one year, maybe longer. If one looks at one year

12
00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:51.380
The child from our description could be mine.

13
00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:58.820
We just asked me

14
00:00:58.820 --> 00:00:59.760
What if something like that happens?

15
00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:01.420
Then are you
