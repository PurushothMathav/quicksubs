00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:03.100
I'm going to the headquarters. Do I need to be in a hurry?

2
00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:15.520
Another day when I'm at home, would you like me to make food?

3
00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:18.100
What else? Please change,

4
00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:27.970
Is there something urgent at home?

5
00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:28.510
Looking for something?

6
00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.560
Come if you wish, I have something to talk to you about.

7
00:00:53.040 --> 00:01:00.560
Come in, everyone is here,

8
00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:07.000
I opened the door and dismissed.

9
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.740
Why bother, agree to divorce,

10
00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.150
Moreover, please leave the house, I am responsible for the family.

11
00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:14.410
He will bless the owners of the society, and it is no wonder that he is in charge alone.

12
00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:17.780
Then you are doing a bad job with your annual exemption

13
00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.170
I can say that he can change it

14
00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.280
It's because he's not qualified enough

15
00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.640
Originally, your remaining family was not worthy of our family.

16
00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:30.590
If it weren't for him, our old man's life would be in jeopardy

17
00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:33.430
It's you who are responsible for us

18
00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:35.810
He is not qualified to write

19
00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:37.810
Anyway one year later

20
00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:39.070
you must divorce

21
00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:42.250
It’s just that Yancheng doesn’t have this kind of medicine anymore.

22
00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:45.850
You must take the anti-luck medicine obediently

23
00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:48.200
This leftover woman

24
00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:50.590
Not qualified to have a child left with Yancheng

25
00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:55.020
Ms. Bai has not been married for three years

26
00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.280
Never pestered her

27
00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.080
Three thirds and five times of cultivation

28
00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:01.940
I'm going to ask my dad to come over today.

29
00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:05.100
Is she going too far?

30
00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:09.380
First of all, what I said doesn’t sit well with you, right? Finish it

31
00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:11.700
Don't use our stupid money

32
00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:17.410
If you want to pass it, you will have to pay tens of millions of dollars.

33
00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:26.440
Don’t count if you don’t roll over.

34
00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.820
How many truths can you tell Yuan Cheng?

35
00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:33.700
What to say and what not to say

36
00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:43.360
You don’t believe me either. How about you, Ms. Bai? Ms. Bai?
