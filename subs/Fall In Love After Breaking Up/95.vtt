00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:02.600
long thought,

2
00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:05.070
Are you going to open the door?

3
00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:07.050
It took fifteen years to ask for money.

4
00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:10.270
You let him see that he will die to you again every year,

5
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:13.650
You go back here and leave it to me.

6
00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:15.390
It turned out to be fifteen years.

7
00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:29.270
You let me go back and forth home,

8
00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:32.960
In the morning, I was prompted to guide someone here to ask you for money.

9
00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:35.040
Are you so shameless?

10
00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:42.670
It's possible even for me,

11
00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:45.850
But now my dad has to wait for proof at the hospital and it will cost him money.

12
00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.780
Can you save me a million,

13
00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:49.460
I will definitely return it to you.

14
00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:54.720
That's why the company commander was willing to ask for money all night with such a pretense.

15
00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:55.580
I'm not grandpa

16
00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:57.200
I won't accept your movies

17
00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:58.640
We pay the family

18
00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.680
I won't give you any more money

19
00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.280
Grandpa was so angry with you that he even got sick.

20
00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.180
If you have any conscience

21
00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:14.040
Just hurry up and give me a life and wait.

22
00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.850
can't give up

23
00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:22.340
As expected of Xiaojia Xiaohui.

24
00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:23.060
What a bad idea

25
00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:29.310
Doesn't he like expensive things?

26
00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:30.380
Let him be expensive
