Your father has already spoken

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:15.300
If I can’t hate a thousand blames, I don’t want anyone else to see my dad for a year.

4
00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:17.080
How come it’s all my words?

5
00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:28.170

11
00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:50.600
I'll do it

12
00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:52.780
"Bie Mo" is Taiwanese

13
00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:15.310
I'm catching up with you
