00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:08.119
Too bad. This way,

2
00:00:08.119 --> 00:00:09.800
I only give you time to realize it,

3
00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:11.940
The whole young one was aborted, and sure enough,

4
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:13.480
You are responsible for the consequences!

5
00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:17.660
Dad, Mom will definitely protect you

6
00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:23.000
It turns out that what you are good at is not just service, there are many people who have played successful cards.

7
00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.100
This is also true

8
00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.700
I don't think anyone can be responsible for you

9
00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.510
No, it's urgent now

10
00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:46.170
It’s also a responsible life

11
00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.750
Now we have lost the backer of negative power.

12
00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:52.310
I can also take action with confidence and confidence

13
00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:58.090
It’s better not to meet each other unnaturally during this period of time

14
00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:11.330
Boss, I ended up with just a hard design.

15
00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:12.410
Just go once or twice more

16
00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.510
Can you find someone to go for me?

17
00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:16.170
Look what's wrong with you

18
00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:19.020
Feeling a little uncomfortable

19
00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:22.940
Boss, please do it

20
00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.970
You have a good rest

21
00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:26.190
I'll find someone from the cooperative to go there for you.

22
00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:31.770
No long-term relationship with a wife

23
00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:33.340
A big opportunity for cooperatives

24
00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.440
This shouldn't be difficult to do

25
00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:38.060
Everyone, this is it

26
00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.000
The design of this pre-grade courtyard

27
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.590
It’s going to be more expensive now

28
00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:42.850
But there was something wrong with him after patting him

29
00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:44.840
Who should be out?

30
00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.120
pre-level curve

31
00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:48.420
That's easy to talk about.
