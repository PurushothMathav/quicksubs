00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:09.720
Have you always been scared? Why did you suddenly die?

2
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.440
How do I know?

3
00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:14.360
I already have Jiaranwan. Please stay alive every two days.

4
00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:20.150
How did it happen to me? You suddenly said something else

5
00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:23.240
Are you going to clean this book immediately? Donâ€™t you do it cleanly?

6
00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.420
Does it show that there can be more than 300,000 on another day?

7
00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:28.520
But at this time, it is said that 1 million is needed.

8
00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:31.490
If the fee can be paid before noon tomorrow,

9
00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:32.890
Then you can really get into the first book

10
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:38.120
If we can't pay it, then we can't pay 300,000 for a thousand dollars.

11
00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.130
How could it be? Graduation? What if it was your deputy?

12
00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:45.270
Is it someone else?

13
00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:47.810
Isn't this pack faster than going through the scene? That's nonsense.

14
00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:49.490
Even the process

15
00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.680
How is it possible to get more than 1 million?

16
00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:52.970
Give you money

17
00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.840
It's really because you don't mean what you say

18
00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:57.980
Company's financial condition

19
00:00:57.980 --> 00:00:59.180
You know, right?

20
00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.100
Just the little money you gave me

21
00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:02.670
But the sky cries the dragon

22
00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:04.440
How can there be more money?

23
00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.400
What can I do with your money?

24
00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:07.580
Rather rich

25
00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:10.640
Are there any options from the Chinese side that I gave you?

26
00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:13.980
Why are you so new?

27
00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.560
You have a male Buddha to blame me

28
00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.940
Why don't you think about how to withdraw money?

29
00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.050
If you have such words, you are leaving

30
00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:27.950
Just give him to you

31
00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:31.600
China can handle 1.3 million by tomorrow

32
00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.680
And this is just a dream

33
00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:37.400
It is death in this life
