After a woman gets married, no matter how bad the man treats her,

2
00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:08.300
During the meal, the adults thought that she had nothing to do but why she just didn't want to get married.

3
00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:13.980
Well, I'm the vice president. After most women get married,

4
00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.980
Everyone's popularity with the family will increase.

5
00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:19.080
Although people can feel the news when I take pictures of you,

6
00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.870
And I am independent at work, but I may not ask you to take photos of you.

7
00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:27.310
The description of marriage for women is as follows.

8
00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.850
I said, shoot you. I talk too much

9
00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:33.650
It's not good to take care of you when you return.

10
00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:35.050
If you pay a pie, what else can you get?

11
00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:41.600
This is Shiya’s own self. Do not brag about it.

12
00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:48.270
Grandpa is coming back today

13
00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:49.830
She said she asked you to take the holy cotton with you

14
00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:51.230
Let's go pick her up together

15
00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:52.600
Mom, I know

16
00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:54.360
It’s a good look at the people who come back to the Holy Family

17
00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:56.570
Lest they earn money from the old man's presence

18
00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:58.630
What thoughts should not be included in life?

19
00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:08.440
Okay, you can take care of the bad boss

20
00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:09.690
sorry sorry

21
00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:11.330
I'm really sorry, Mr. Fu.

22
00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:13.160
Others keep calling me husband

23
00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:14.190
You really should apologize

24
00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:15.960
holy cotton of holy cotton

25
00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.440
Even if she is really your husband

26
00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:19.200
It’s not like you really can’t scream out.
