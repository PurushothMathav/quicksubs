1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.790
OK, like me,

2
00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:07.780
How is it possible? If he really likes me,

3
00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:10.960
I will never force myself to talk about my hunger because I know how to recognize three parties and five characters.

4
00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:13.150
You don't understand this.

5
00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:15.790
Just wait.

6
00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:21.520
When a woman goes to meet a woman, she doesn’t understand, thinking.

7
00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:23.460
See if the teacher doesn’t do that.

8
00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:29.560
Why don't you understand that you haven't seen a woman yet?

9
00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.880
so. I have a test here,

10
00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.040
Are you okay? You want to test it soon?

11
00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.460
We're going to try.

12
00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:39.960
say, one,

13
00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.720
Whether he tries or not,

14
00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.440
Don’t try, don’t try, don’t try, don’t try, don’t try, don’t you try?

15
00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.050
How do I feel that even though I have become

16
00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:57.070
I've been making reservations and I'll take a look.

17
00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:00.740
There is no need to try this, then the second one

18
00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:03.580
Is he the commander-in-chief?

19
00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:06.970
I know that Ling Qingjun is the president

20
00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:13.610
Auntie is searching? Is there a third party?

21
00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:28.450
Does he always have us to remove the fourth point in the figure?

22
00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:30.710
In order not to let you misunderstand

23
00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:31.850
Is he

24
00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:37.810
Deny unjust feelings and care about others before reading

25
00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:44.860
It’s really not fun if you’re not married.

26
00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:50.660
This fifth point is all

27
00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:53.740
When is the person he can like?

28
00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.240
But he will

29
00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.620
jealous

30
00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.210
Congratulations on coming to you

31
00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:05.220
Anyway, how much do the first four weigh?

32
00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.080
Never leave

33
00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:08.419
It depends on whether you want to eat or not.
