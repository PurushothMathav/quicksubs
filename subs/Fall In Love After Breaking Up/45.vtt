00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:03.490
If you have the guts to reach out to Negiye City

2
00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:05.560
Still holding me and protecting me for your parents

3
00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:07.360
Your dad's game is like this now

4
00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:09.350
It's all on you

5
00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:16.309
What will it become? I'm not a good person. It's scary.

6
00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:28.350
What are you doing? How is my father?

7
00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:29.670
Why is it booted suddenly?

8
00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.930
The stem brain of life goes to the flag. Please don’t take care of yourself.

9
00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:40.880
What are you? Are you sure? There is really no other way

10
00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:43.810
From that piece of people to this present gift

11
00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:45.830
How could you go to the room?

12
00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.560
Vice President, I still don’t have much to say above.

13
00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:00.980
By the way, I don’t even want to do the superficial job of looking for a good old man.

14
00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:20.520
Then why don't you continue to fight? You don't want to meet each other?

15
00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:21.520
Why didn't you come?
