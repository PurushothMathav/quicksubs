00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.266
Are you all right?

2
00:00:01.466 --> 00:00:03.066
Should I take you to the hospital?

3
00:00:03.866 --> 00:00:04.666
Ah!

4
00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:06.300
No, no.

5
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:07.633
I'll go back to my mother first

6
00:00:14.966 --> 00:00:17.066
Mom, I'm sorry.

7
00:00:17.166 --> 00:00:18.800
I'm late.

8
00:00:19.066 --> 00:00:21.800
Failed to catch the bastards who beat you

9
00:00:22.166 --> 00:00:24.166
Let them run away

10
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.300
Mom, wake up

11
00:00:26.766 --> 00:00:28.600
You woke up mom

12
00:00:30.666 --> 00:00:33.633
Yo bitch, why are you crying?

13
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.366
Oh, the old thing is really useless.

14
00:00:37.366 --> 00:00:39.800
Why don't you just die?

15
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.366
So that I can get an extra insurance sister-in-law

16
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.066
Sister-in-law, I married you to bring money

17
00:00:48.333 --> 00:00:50.933
My mom doesn't even have the money for medical treatment

18
00:00:50.933 --> 00:00:52.800
You can't do that.

19
00:00:54.166 --> 00:00:55.633
What can't you do?

20
00:00:56.366 --> 00:01:00.833
The money given by your Zhang family is much worse

21
00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.833
Look at that

22
00:01:04.166 --> 00:01:06.766
Why don't you take your body

23
00:01:06.766 --> 00:01:08.700
Hahaha let me wear it.

24
00:01:08.933 --> 00:01:09.733
How much?

25
00:01:10.666 --> 00:01:12.766
Ah let me go

26
00:01:13.066 --> 00:01:13.866
beast

27
00:01:14.733 --> 00:01:16.966
Are you stupid?

28
00:01:20.866 --> 00:01:22.666
Stop calling old things

29
00:01:23.066 --> 00:01:26.033
Send me to the west now

30
00:01:26.966 --> 00:01:31.166
Let go of my mom

31
00:01:31.666 --> 00:01:32.900
Uh-huh.

32
00:01:33.733 --> 00:01:35.266
Uh-huh.

33
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:36.800
Ah!

34
00:01:37.866 --> 00:01:39.500
Uh-huh.

35
00:01:40.266 --> 00:01:41.066
Ah!

36
00:01:42.333 --> 00:01:47.033
Ahhh, you can't run away now.

37
00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:48.300
Stop barking

38
00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:51.833
You call my husband and no one can come to save you. Let go

39
00:01:55.066 --> 00:01:55.966
brother

40
00:01:57.166 --> 00:01:58.666
They they

41
00:01:59.133 --> 00:02:01.766
I'm dead

42
00:02:02.166 --> 00:02:03.666
What nonsense are you talking about?

43
00:02:03.866 --> 00:02:06.400
Your mother was beaten to death, do you blame me?

44
00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:10.100
Zhang Shucheng, this is also for our own good

45
00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.733
If you listen to this bitch's nonsense

46
00:02:12.733 --> 00:02:14.866
Let's not get married

47
00:02:15.933 --> 00:02:19.533
Little bitch, my sister is such a beauty with a beautiful logo

48
00:02:19.533 --> 00:02:22.166
It would be nice to marry your brother, this wimp

49
00:02:22.166 --> 00:02:24.533
How dare you frame my sister?

50
00:02:24.533 --> 00:02:25.333
That's enough!

51
00:02:26.133 --> 00:02:29.433
All beings in the three realms are reincarnated by me

52
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.300
My mom's not dead yet

53
00:02:31.333 --> 00:02:32.700
When I heal him

54
00:02:32.933 --> 00:02:34.400
The truth will come out

55
00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:35.200
Linlin

56
00:02:35.333 --> 00:02:38.866
At that time, even if I can let Jiro go

57
00:02:38.866 --> 00:02:40.233
Distinguish between loyalty and adultery

58
00:02:40.366 --> 00:02:42.000
He must not tolerate you

59
00:02:42.733 --> 00:02:44.900
Hahahaha

60
00:02:45.666 --> 00:02:48.433
The reincarnation of the world is determined by you

61
00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.400
Pulse stopped

62
00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.666
Even if Yama comes, he can't save Zhang Shoucheng

63
00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.500
Are you afraid that you have lost your mind?

64
00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.333
Zhang Shoucheng, are you really crazy?

65
00:02:59.333 --> 00:03:01.266
Why don't you hurry up and take your mother's illness?

66
00:03:01.266 --> 00:03:03.200
Go for a down payment to marry my sister

67
00:03:03.333 --> 00:03:05.733
What else is there to make that old thing shrink?

68
00:03:05.733 --> 00:03:07.566
What do you think about this person dying? Are you?

69
00:03:07.566 --> 00:03:08.900
You want to cheat?

70
00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.500
Brother, what nonsense are you talking about?

71
00:03:13.066 --> 00:03:15.100
Mom is dead

72
00:03:15.566 --> 00:03:17.633
Can't find it back

73
00:03:17.866 --> 00:03:21.200
Don't worry, I'll ask someone to rely on our mother.

74
00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:22.833
He will wake up in a while

75
00:03:23.566 --> 00:03:27.166
Zhang Shoucheng, I'm afraid you're really crazy

76
00:03:27.166 --> 00:03:28.700
How can a person come back to life after death?

77
00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:32.033
The most important thing for this person is to recognize reality

78
00:03:32.166 --> 00:03:34.133
And called someone to treat a dead man

79
00:03:34.133 --> 00:03:36.100
Do you think you are heaven and earth?

80
00:03:36.466 --> 00:03:38.566
Today I will call the King of Hell

81
00:03:38.566 --> 00:03:41.633
Ask if my mother is dead
