00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:02.800
This ancient tung tree has really sprouted, right?

2
00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:05.000
Is there really something in this ancient bronze tree?

3
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.466
This this

4
00:00:06.733 --> 00:00:08.066
Longtan Fengyuan

5
00:00:08.066 --> 00:00:11.100
Guan Xian preached, is this really true?

6
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:14.166
This is Tongtian Shenshu Sword Eye Bodhi

7
00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:15.800
Can actually grow trees

8
00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:17.366
Why didn't I take a picture?

9
00:00:17.366 --> 00:00:19.700
Hmph, this tree is really auspicious

10
00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:21.866
What did I think it was?

11
00:00:21.866 --> 00:00:23.266
Isn't it just a tree?

12
00:00:23.266 --> 00:00:27.866
How much of this kind of thing do you want in the back mountain of my house?

13
00:00:27.866 --> 00:00:29.500
As many as you want

14
00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.966
The theme of the divine tree connecting heaven and earth

15
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:33.566
Do you have it too?

16
00:00:33.566 --> 00:00:36.766
That's right, Zhang Shoucheng, are you really crazy?

17
00:00:36.766 --> 00:00:38.700
This tree that connects heaven and earth

18
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.466
Could it be that you can really let him find the sky?

19
00:00:41.466 --> 00:00:43.466
Then you watch it.

20
00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:48.600
Ah, that's impossible.

21
00:00:49.133 --> 00:00:50.166
He's really grown up.

22
00:00:50.166 --> 00:00:51.366
The tree starts to grow again

23
00:00:51.366 --> 00:00:51.900
This tree

24
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.500
How could it have grown so big in the blink of an eye?

25
00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.666
What's the use of dirty hands supporting you?

26
00:00:55.666 --> 00:00:58.533
A little trick is like impersonating a mythical beast

27
00:00:58.533 --> 00:01:01.033
Do you really think this old man is gullible?

28
00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.066
I'm going to expose you

29
00:01:08.066 --> 00:01:11.200
Ahhh, what's going on here?

30
00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.066
Earthquake

31
00:01:12.066 --> 00:01:14.600
It seems that it was because Sun Daochang cut down this divine tree

32
00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:15.533
Angry Tiandao

33
00:01:15.533 --> 00:01:17.266
I don't believe it anymore

34
00:01:17.566 --> 00:01:19.300
Daochang Sun, stop cutting

35
00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:20.866
This tree seems real

36
00:01:20.866 --> 00:01:23.100
It's really the Heavenly Tree

37
00:01:23.766 --> 00:01:25.633
Haha, happy.

38
00:01:25.766 --> 00:01:28.300
How offensive was I just now?

39
00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:30.200
So I'll give you 200 million.

40
00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.100
Plus plus guide your leisure path

41
00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.400
You give us the crown of this tree

42
00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.366
How's it going?
