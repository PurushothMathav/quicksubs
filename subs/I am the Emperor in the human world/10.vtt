1
00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:01.300
An unknown intelligence

2
00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:03.366
Who would want something of unknown origin?

3
00:00:03.366 --> 00:00:05.800
Hurry up and bring the divine pill to the next auction.

4
00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:09.033
This junk that's not even bronze

5
00:00:09.166 --> 00:00:12.133
You are so embarrassed to take this Skylark Sky out for auction

6
00:00:12.133 --> 00:00:14.900
That's it, this crap

7
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
How could someone like a beast possibly have eyes on you?

8
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.866
People don't know treasures in Baoshan

9
00:00:19.966 --> 00:00:21.566
A group of mortals with naked eyes

10
00:00:21.566 --> 00:00:23.866
What do I want for 20,000?

11
00:00:23.866 --> 00:00:25.133
Hahahaha

12
00:00:25.133 --> 00:00:28.100
Zhang Shoucheng, are you really pretending to be tough enough?

13
00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:31.566
20,000 you take it out?

14
00:00:31.566 --> 00:00:34.433
A piece of junk is a treasure

15
00:00:34.533 --> 00:00:36.366
What about this inferior person?

16
00:00:36.366 --> 00:00:39.200
It's just inferior people, hahaha.

17
00:00:39.466 --> 00:00:42.066
To buy a counterfeit that wasn't even bronze

18
00:00:42.066 --> 00:00:45.600
You are so short-sighted and you also give me well products

19
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:46.633
Mr. Zhang

20
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.300
This ancient bronze tree is just the color of bronze

21
00:00:49.333 --> 00:00:51.366
But it actually has no collectible value.

22
00:00:51.366 --> 00:00:53.033
If you continue to call me that

23
00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.566
I'm afraid it will be lost

24
00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:55.200
Can't catch

25
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.300
They can't feel the breath of the Bodhi tree

26
00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.466
What does nature mean?

27
00:00:58.466 --> 00:01:00.566
Later he will be immersed in light

28
00:01:00.566 --> 00:01:02.066
Illuminate the mountains and rivers

29
00:01:02.066 --> 00:01:03.700
Don't be greedy

30
00:01:04.366 --> 00:01:06.300
I want twenty thousand

31
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:07.966
We eye zen

32
00:01:07.966 --> 00:01:11.000
Eye Zen, did you spend money on a junk?

33
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.866
A piece of junk

34
00:01:12.866 --> 00:01:16.100
Only stupid people would pay for it.

35
00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:17.566
Hahaha look

36
00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:18.766
Give it to him

37
00:01:18.766 --> 00:01:20.033
20,000

38
00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:21.800
20,000 twice

39
00:01:22.133 --> 00:01:23.466
20,000 three times

40
00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.100
Congratulations to Mr. Zhang for getting this ancient bronze tree.

41
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.100
Hahahaha

42
00:01:43.266 --> 00:01:47.466
Boy, what do you mean by immersion?

43
00:01:47.466 --> 00:01:50.666
Why is your bronze spell not moving?

44
00:01:50.666 --> 00:01:52.733
This trash is clearly gibberish

45
00:01:52.733 --> 00:01:55.466
Eight, kick this fool out for me

46
00:01:55.466 --> 00:01:57.100
Body is a Bodhi tree

47
00:01:57.333 --> 00:01:59.233
Heart like a mirror

48
00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.300
Sink in with one move

49
00:02:01.733 --> 00:02:03.566
Call the heavens to come

50
00:02:28.366 --> 00:02:30.900
This paulownia tree has really sprouted
