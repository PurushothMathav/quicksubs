1
00:00:02.533 --> 00:00:05.166
Mr. Zhang really achieved this

2
00:00:05.166 --> 00:00:06.400
How is that possible?

3
00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.866
What evil method did he use in the king's mansion?

4
00:00:08.866 --> 00:00:10.066
Just got on this teacher's day

5
00:00:10.066 --> 00:00:11.166
That's not going to happen.

6
00:00:11.166 --> 00:00:13.966
Teacher's Day is as heavy as a thousand dollars for practitioners

7
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.233
How could he have crossed over so easily?

8
00:00:16.466 --> 00:00:19.166
My strength is second only to Master Qingfeng

9
00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.000
I can't even step out

10
00:00:21.133 --> 00:00:22.833
How could he be?

11
00:00:26.533 --> 00:00:27.800
After time

12
00:00:28.066 --> 00:00:30.566
The micro-pressure of the Kunlun treasure mirror is even more terrifying

13
00:00:31.333 --> 00:00:33.500
Grind mortals into basic

14
00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.200
So how did he do it?

15
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.266
Is impossible

16
00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.200
Zhang Shoucheng is not only intact

17
00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:39.700
Walking so easily

18
00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:40.766
How is that possible?

19
00:00:40.766 --> 00:00:42.666
These 20 steps

20
00:00:43.333 --> 00:00:45.366
This is the extent to which the old Buddha cave is laborious.

21
00:00:45.366 --> 00:00:47.966
This he is still going up

22
00:00:48.133 --> 00:00:49.766
Could it be that this city guard

23
00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.800
Can you really step on these 28 steps?

24
00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:54.633
This is impossible

25
00:00:55.133 --> 00:00:58.433
24 knots is the limit of a cliff stumble

26
00:00:58.533 --> 00:01:01.133
Rescue 25 lost three grandmasters

27
00:01:01.133 --> 00:01:02.300
Reasonable to enter

28
00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:03.800
He is a waste

29
00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.100
How is it possible to step into this 26 verses?

30
00:01:09.766 --> 00:01:12.066
Verse 27 This is the old man

31
00:01:12.066 --> 00:01:14.466
It's too high to bear alone.

32
00:01:14.466 --> 00:01:16.900
Is it true that Mr. Zhong said he was destined?

33
00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:18.433
No, no.

34
00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:22.066
Bajie Zhang Shoucheng is just a waste who carries a big gang

35
00:01:22.066 --> 00:01:23.766
How is that possible?

36
00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:25.800
You see the moon and the stars up there.

37
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:26.833
Fairy Descent

38
00:01:26.966 --> 00:01:27.800
Could it be that

39
00:01:27.866 --> 00:01:30.766
Do they all want to see Zhang Shoucheng step into the 28th step?

40
00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.966
It's impossible to reach level 28
