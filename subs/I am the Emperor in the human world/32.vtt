00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.300
Ah, 14 kilograms.

2
00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:09.700
He crossed the barrier of Kunlun Castle

3
00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:11.700
Accepted by Kunlun Castle

4
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:12.333
This oops

5
00:00:12.333 --> 00:00:15.000
This celestial fairy is like walking on flat ground for him

6
00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:16.266
Who the hell is he?

7
00:00:16.266 --> 00:00:18.800
How is this possible?

8
00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.266
Boy, pinch me

9
00:00:21.533 --> 00:00:23.266
Am I dreaming?

10
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.166
Mom, you're not dreaming

11
00:00:25.466 --> 00:00:27.600
It really reached the 28th session today.

12
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.666
Impossible this is impossible

13
00:00:29.733 --> 00:00:31.066
He is a waste

14
00:00:31.066 --> 00:00:33.366
How can I get the introduction of Kunlun Guarantee?

15
00:00:33.366 --> 00:00:35.466
Hey look at the sky

16
00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:40.600
Ah!

17
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.166
All kinds of immortals appear

18
00:00:49.166 --> 00:00:51.366
What kind of power is this?

19
00:00:51.366 --> 00:00:52.133
This is the master

20
00:00:52.133 --> 00:00:54.366
Your parent lion can't do it

21
00:00:59.333 --> 00:01:00.133
Ah!

22
00:01:00.666 --> 00:01:03.200
Does the ancient sword respond?

23
00:01:03.366 --> 00:01:06.900
What is the long-lived prime minister doing to board these 28 rooms?

24
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.166
Nothing can

25
00:01:08.166 --> 00:01:11.066
Could it be that he still wants to repair the dragon vein?

26
00:01:11.066 --> 00:01:12.166
Is impossible

27
00:01:12.966 --> 00:01:14.366
Even if he does

28
00:01:14.366 --> 00:01:15.666
He won't stay long

29
00:01:15.666 --> 00:01:17.666
Yes, I see.

30
00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.333
He's just hanging out in prison

31
00:01:20.333 --> 00:01:23.300
You'll be chopped down in a while

32
00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:24.700
A minute has passed

33
00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.100
It hasn't popped up yet.

34
00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.866
Don't you tell him to die?

35
00:01:30.133 --> 00:01:32.066
Kunlun mirror reflects all things in the three realms

36
00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.200
true

37
00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.300
Standing in front of the Kunlun Treasure Mirror, I closed the three worlds

38
00:01:36.533 --> 00:01:39.066
This is the half-step fairy of the old man

39
00:01:39.166 --> 00:01:40.933
Can't do it either?

40
00:01:40.933 --> 00:01:41.466
Is he

41
00:01:41.466 --> 00:01:44.300
Is Zhang Shoucheng really the destined person of Kunlun Treasure Mirror?
