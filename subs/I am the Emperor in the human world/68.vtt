00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.800
Mom, how can you say that?

2
00:00:03.533 --> 00:00:04.333
Go away

3
00:00:04.333 --> 00:00:06.133
I just hope you marry the old lady and don't ask any more

4
00:00:06.133 --> 00:00:06.733
I'm back!

5
00:00:06.733 --> 00:00:08.000
Please come back

6
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.700
I think you'd be crazy to say that

7
00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:12.966
Get out of here right now

8
00:00:12.966 --> 00:00:14.666
Hey, young handsome brother, don't go

9
00:00:15.133 --> 00:00:15.733
Don't worry, Jing'er.

10
00:00:15.733 --> 00:00:17.900
Without me, none of you can go to the Qin family banquet

11
00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:18.800
speak out

12
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.066
Qin Shao invites you

13
00:00:20.066 --> 00:00:22.966
Who do you think you are, Qin Shaodao?

14
00:00:27.066 --> 00:00:30.033
Hey, where's the light?

15
00:00:30.333 --> 00:00:32.266
Oh, long hand, are you there too?

16
00:00:32.266 --> 00:00:33.933
Just in time, I have something to do with you

17
00:00:33.933 --> 00:00:35.200
Go go go

18
00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:37.900
Sister, sister, oops.

19
00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:39.866
Emotional intelligence, Zhang Shoucheng hurt you

20
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:40.966
That's his business.

21
00:00:40.966 --> 00:00:42.500
It has nothing to do with our Qi family.

22
00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:43.266
You want revenge?

23
00:00:43.266 --> 00:00:45.866
Although you are looking for Zhang Shoucheng, this kid is lying

24
00:00:45.866 --> 00:00:47.233
Also lied to my daughter

25
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:48.733
Don't be soft

26
00:00:48.733 --> 00:00:51.400
Mom, it was the rain that kidnapped me

27
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:52.600
How can you blame the city?

28
00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.466
What are you doing here in July?

29
00:00:54.466 --> 00:00:56.133
Damn girl, what are you talking about?

30
00:00:56.133 --> 00:00:57.533
How dare you talk to Qin Shang like this

31
00:00:57.533 --> 00:00:58.666
See if I kill you

32
00:00:58.966 --> 00:01:00.166
Don't play doubles

33
00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.033
Speaking of which

34
00:01:03.766 --> 00:01:05.000
It's all my master's fault

35
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.933
I came to my door today to apologize

36
00:01:06.933 --> 00:01:10.066
For the sake of weekdays

37
00:01:10.066 --> 00:01:11.566
Don't be mad at me!

38
00:01:11.566 --> 00:01:13.000
What the hell is going on?

39
00:01:13.333 --> 00:01:16.266
Is what Zhang Shoucheng said true?

40
00:01:16.266 --> 00:01:18.700
There's a fake mom

41
00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.333
The rest of him is a jerk

42
00:01:20.333 --> 00:01:21.966
What are you talking about?

43
00:01:22.466 --> 00:01:24.500
The animals came to the door to apologize in person

44
00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.366
Even if you suffer a great grievance, you have to swallow it

45
00:01:27.366 --> 00:01:27.966
Later?

46
00:01:27.966 --> 00:01:30.500
Our seven families still rely on the support of the Qin family

47
00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:31.833
You say yes, beast
