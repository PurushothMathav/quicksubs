00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.900
Since my mother is not dead

2
00:00:02.166 --> 00:00:04.266
And I'm going to show you.

3
00:00:04.266 --> 00:00:06.033
What is jindan revival

4
00:00:07.166 --> 00:00:08.466
Where is the old gentleman

5
00:00:14.133 --> 00:00:15.900
What's going on here?

6
00:00:16.366 --> 00:00:18.866
Immortals are really immortals

7
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:19.966
Lao Jun

8
00:00:20.933 --> 00:00:22.400
Am I not dreaming?

9
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.766
I have an elixir in heaven and earth

10
00:00:24.766 --> 00:00:26.633
She can live forever

11
00:00:26.666 --> 00:00:28.066
invulnerable to all diseases

12
00:00:28.066 --> 00:00:29.300
What eggs?

13
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.166
I think it's melisol

14
00:00:31.333 --> 00:00:33.400
I might have eggs

15
00:00:33.566 --> 00:00:36.433
You'll soon find out if this is an elixir

16
00:00:36.533 --> 00:00:38.300
Lao Jun, use it now

17
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.666
Ah, this is impossible

18
00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.766
How could this old thing still be alive?

19
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.466
Wasn't that an illusion?

20
00:00:56.933 --> 00:00:57.900
A gentleman has a lord

21
00:00:58.166 --> 00:00:59.600
That's impossible.

22
00:01:00.533 --> 00:01:02.266
How is mom

23
00:01:02.266 --> 00:01:03.400
Chen'er

24
00:01:03.933 --> 00:01:05.900
You're finally back.

25
00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.166
This is the woman.

26
00:01:09.266 --> 00:01:11.066
He sent someone to beat me

27
00:01:11.133 --> 00:01:13.033
And cover me to death here

28
00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:14.866
It's really you, Elin

29
00:01:15.466 --> 00:01:17.066
What else is there to say now?

30
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.100
How is that possible?

31
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.166
You must have taken everything to bully me, right?

32
00:01:22.166 --> 00:01:25.266
This old thing is clearly talking nonsense.

33
00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.300
What's wrong, Li Lin?

34
00:01:29.766 --> 00:01:31.533
People are doing it and the sky is watching

35
00:01:31.533 --> 00:01:33.766
God and everyone are angry at what you do

36
00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.433
I said even if I could bear it

37
00:01:36.466 --> 00:01:38.433
Swift Erlang God will not let go

38
00:01:42.133 --> 00:01:44.000
Uh-huh.

39
00:01:44.366 --> 00:01:46.600
I read that right?

40
00:01:47.333 --> 00:01:48.900
Ju really can't kill anyone

41
00:01:49.766 --> 00:01:50.700
Angel descends

42
00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:52.833
Is it difficult for you and I to be

43
00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:54.833
It's really going to be a disaster

44
00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.566
I, I, I was wrong. I was wrong.

45
00:01:58.566 --> 00:01:59.966
Qiao Erlang really let me go

46
00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.000
Jiro sincerely forgives

47
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.566
We didn't mean to

48
00:02:03.566 --> 00:02:05.066
Please be sincere
