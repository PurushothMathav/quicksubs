00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.066
If you don't believe me, you can ask Daochang Sun

2
00:00:03.733 --> 00:00:05.266
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

3
00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:06.666
It's Mr. Zhang.

4
00:00:06.933 --> 00:00:08.800
It was saved by Mr. Zhang

5
00:00:08.933 --> 00:00:10.200
Let Mr. Zhang Zhang

6
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.600
Please give me back 9 shots

7
00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:15.033
That's more like it.

8
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:17.866
The laws of heaven and earth have their own rules

9
00:00:17.866 --> 00:00:19.166
No matter how outspoken you are

10
00:00:19.166 --> 00:00:20.566
Local legal services

11
00:00:21.733 --> 00:00:24.800
You can write the refund machine and return it, right?

12
00:00:35.166 --> 00:00:36.966
Hahaha hey

13
00:00:37.133 --> 00:00:40.266
I'm ready, hahaha, hey.

14
00:00:40.266 --> 00:00:41.333
Thank you master

15
00:00:41.333 --> 00:00:43.600
Thank you Mr. Zhang

16
00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.000
You are cruel

17
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.966
He didn't pay attention to my usual teachings at all

18
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.566
From today onwards

19
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.700
You are no longer my armed disciple

20
00:00:52.766 --> 00:00:55.166
The fate of you and me as mentors and apprentices is over

21
00:00:55.166 --> 00:00:56.466
From Now On

22
00:00:56.766 --> 00:00:58.233
Don't come to me again

23
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.966
Master master

24
00:01:01.966 --> 00:01:03.800
You can't just walk out on me!

25
00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.033
I'm just obsessed for a while

26
00:01:07.566 --> 00:01:10.166
I didn't expect Daochang Sun to really do it for money

27
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.500
To go inside the seascape

28
00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.300
I'm just for the money. What's wrong?

29
00:01:14.333 --> 00:01:17.266
No one can live without money in this world

30
00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:18.633
Zhang Shoucheng

31
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.366
You let the master abandon me

32
00:01:21.366 --> 00:01:23.166
I lost face.

33
00:01:23.166 --> 00:01:25.033
I'll go, you wait for me.

34
00:01:27.966 --> 00:01:30.533
Daochang Sun turned out to be a greedy person

35
00:01:30.533 --> 00:01:32.833
Thinking about it now, it's really scary

36
00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:34.200
Fortunately, I'm guarding the city

37
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.700
Otherwise, Jing'er's life will really not be saved

38
00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.533
Brother Shoucheng saved his life

39
00:01:38.533 --> 00:01:40.400
Daochang Sun is so immoral

40
00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:41.666
Want revenge

41
00:01:42.733 --> 00:01:45.566
Brother Shoucheng, I'm afraid.

42
00:01:45.766 --> 00:01:47.300
What are you doing?

43
00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:48.933
I'm just hugging you

44
00:01:48.933 --> 00:01:51.466
Besides, Brother Shoucheng is not yours either.

45
00:01:51.466 --> 00:01:52.966
Hug you

46
00:01:52.966 --> 00:01:54.100
You put it down for me

47
00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.466
This week's defense is a waste

48
00:01:56.733 --> 00:01:58.000
You and your sister?

49
00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.666
They are all people who want to give it to Young Master Qin

50
00:01:59.666 --> 00:02:00.833
No one can escape

51
00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:02.300
What!
