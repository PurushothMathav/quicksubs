00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:04.700
This lunatic is just lunatic

2
00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.766
I really thought I was out of heaven and earth

3
00:00:06.766 --> 00:00:08.666
Hahahaha

4
00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:11.400
How dare this trash go?

5
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.600
Well, I'd like to see how you die

6
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.933
Humph, I don't know how high and thick the grass is, mortal

7
00:00:18.933 --> 00:00:20.666
In front of the Kunlun mirror

8
00:00:20.666 --> 00:00:22.500
Only death is certain

9
00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.866
This mortal approaches and dies

10
00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.400
Longevity City can actually enter God Street

11
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:36.866
This is impossible.

12
00:00:36.933 --> 00:00:38.500
Just a few lucky steps

13
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.900
After five steps, he must die suddenly

14
00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:44.500
No, look at the radiance beneath his feet

15
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.233
Clouds in the sky

16
00:00:46.533 --> 00:00:49.500
Yanran is a sign of the arrival of immortals

17
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.100
Master, do you mean

18
00:00:51.366 --> 00:00:54.466
Can his mortal body anger young idlers?

19
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.200
Skyfall

20
00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:57.766
This person must be extraordinary

21
00:00:57.766 --> 00:00:58.766
Absolutely impossible

22
00:00:58.766 --> 00:01:00.366
A mere porter's waste

23
00:01:00.366 --> 00:01:02.300
How can you have such strength?

24
00:01:05.866 --> 00:01:09.333
I have only taken 9 steps into the realm of heaven and man

25
00:01:09.333 --> 00:01:12.800
He actually took 5 steps as a mortal

26
00:01:12.966 --> 00:01:16.266
Only five steps can be taken after ten years of hard work

27
00:01:16.566 --> 00:01:18.266
How did he do it?

28
00:01:18.266 --> 00:01:19.800
Why isn't he down yet?

29
00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.700
Does he want to break through time with his mortal body?

30
00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:23.633
How is that possible?

31
00:01:23.933 --> 00:01:25.766
Even if he was lucky enough to take these five steps

32
00:01:25.766 --> 00:01:28.233
When you reach the tenth step, your soul will definitely be scattered

33
00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:33.300
Here it is.

34
00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.233
Through the ages, the golden light shines through the sky

35
00:01:37.366 --> 00:01:40.266
Was this all attracted by Zhang Shoucheng?

36
00:01:40.333 --> 00:01:43.466
Could Zhang Shoucheng be able to evoke the Casting God Buddha?

37
00:01:43.566 --> 00:01:46.100
The Heavenly Ghost Vein is impossible
