00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:01.666
Hahahaha

2
00:00:01.666 --> 00:00:05.166
Zhang Shoucheng was bitten silly and didn't kneel down

3
00:00:05.166 --> 00:00:06.166
I go

4
00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:10.766
Ah what

5
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:11.833
That's not possible.

6
00:00:11.866 --> 00:00:14.133
He actually even took away the master's devil spirit

7
00:00:14.133 --> 00:00:16.066
How could this demon spirit be confiscated?

8
00:00:16.066 --> 00:00:16.966
Who the hell are you?

9
00:00:16.966 --> 00:00:20.866
You don't recognize me, don't you recognize this magic weapon?

10
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.400
Kunlun mirror how is this possible

11
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.300
Isn't this a Kunlun mirror only available to emperors?

12
00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.866
How could this level of hairstyle be in your hands?

13
00:00:27.933 --> 00:00:28.900
What!

14
00:00:29.533 --> 00:00:30.600
Kunlun mirror

15
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:32.700
territorial Taoist

16
00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:34.233
Take a good look.

17
00:00:34.533 --> 00:00:37.200
Zhang Shoucheng is a porter's waste

18
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.800
How can there be such a celestial-level magic weapon?

19
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.466
I see, this is the bastard used for discrimination

20
00:00:44.066 --> 00:00:45.433
He took my spirit

21
00:00:45.466 --> 00:00:47.266
How could this Kunlun mirror be fake?

22
00:00:47.266 --> 00:00:48.066
Wanshou that day

23
00:00:48.066 --> 00:00:50.266
The Kunlun mirror of the mountain's armed crown has been recovered

24
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:51.366
Did you do it?

25
00:00:51.366 --> 00:00:52.833
Defense is impossible

26
00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.333
This Kunlun Treasure Mirror Company armed officer

27
00:00:55.333 --> 00:00:56.733
The Red Army master can't help it

28
00:00:56.733 --> 00:00:57.866
How could he take it back?

29
00:00:57.866 --> 00:01:00.466
You must have found a way to steal the Kunlun mirror

30
00:01:00.466 --> 00:01:02.466
Hmph little thief chops Zhao

31
00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:05.833
The dinosaur is dead.

32
00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.466
Too bad it's of no use to me
