00:00:01.533 --> 00:00:03.566
Mr. Chen, drive carefully.

00:00:05.533 --> 00:00:07.033
Queen of Scepter

00:00:08.333 --> 00:00:10.000
Facial recognition plus public

00:00:10.366 --> 00:00:11.566
This information

00:00:11.966 --> 00:00:13.500
We must be the only ones getting it.

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:14.566
But...

00:00:15.266 --> 00:00:18.033
These fake USBs aren't bad.

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.866
Tran Pham

00:00:24.866 --> 00:00:27.066
Marrying you was the worst decision I ever made.

00:00:27.066 --> 00:00:28.900
The kind of man who is not a useless waste like you

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:30.100
You are not worthy of me.

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.166
I have thought about divorce.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.933
Then don't forget to sign the divorce papers.

00:00:34.933 --> 00:00:37.666
The house belongs to me, the property belongs to you.

00:00:37.666 --> 00:00:38.466
It's me.

00:00:39.166 --> 00:00:41.866
Whatever. I'll go back and pack my things.

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:49.366
Back.

00:00:50.466 --> 00:00:51.800
Try my food.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.300
Why are you at my house?

00:00:54.333 --> 00:00:55.466
My mother is here.

00:00:56.366 --> 00:00:58.833
I heard you are getting divorced.

00:00:58.966 --> 00:01:00.200
Afraid you're lonely

00:01:01.066 --> 00:01:03.366
What do you want?
