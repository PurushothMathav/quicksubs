00:00:00.466 --> 00:00:01.900
You deserve it.

00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:03.766
Looks like divorcing you was the right thing to do in the first place.

00:00:03.766 --> 00:00:05.100
There is no such thing as polite manners.

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.300
That ancestor was blind and saw you.

00:00:08.133 --> 00:00:09.466
You are not going, are you?

00:00:09.566 --> 00:00:10.500
Let's go.

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:13.200
I wonder if you have something to do?

00:00:13.566 --> 00:00:15.066
Bao Ton Dai Long came to pick me up.

00:00:15.066 --> 00:00:16.166
You explain to him.

00:00:16.166 --> 00:00:17.600
It's okay if we don't meet.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.066
Ton Dai Long

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.433
Sister, is your stuff packed yet?

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.666
What is Van Lele doing?

00:00:29.666 --> 00:00:31.333
So can you help me explain a little?

00:00:31.333 --> 00:00:32.866
We are fine too.

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:34.366
I tell you.

00:00:34.366 --> 00:00:35.066
Mr. Long.

00:00:35.066 --> 00:00:37.833
Now is the great business of Huada.

00:00:39.333 --> 00:00:42.366
I'm afraid not anymore.
