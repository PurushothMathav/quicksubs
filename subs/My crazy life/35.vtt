00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.166
Where I am seems to have nothing to do with you.

00:00:04.166 --> 00:00:05.700
In high class places

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.000
Saw someone who shouldn't be here.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.833
Nature affects the heart

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:12.800
Still so arrogant.

00:00:13.933 --> 00:00:15.500
Yesterday viewed friends circle

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:18.833
I heard someone was fired from the company.

00:00:19.966 --> 00:00:23.833
You say why you mess up more pathetic.

00:00:24.166 --> 00:00:27.500
People over 30 still can't do anything.

00:00:27.533 --> 00:00:30.166
Luckily I was quick-witted enough to break up with you at first.

00:00:31.166 --> 00:00:32.133
Want me to say.

00:00:32.133 --> 00:00:34.866
He was fired from the company.

00:00:34.866 --> 00:00:37.266
So I want to beg here.

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:39.433
Just him.

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:43.366

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:48.666
Are you a small person?

00:00:49.266 --> 00:00:50.433
What is the argument?

00:00:50.666 --> 00:00:53.833
Oh, sorry, Mr. Yu.

00:00:55.066 --> 00:00:57.600
Your class is getting worse and worse.

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:59.266
Everyone gave up their seats.

00:01:00.733 --> 00:01:01.700
Sorry sir.
