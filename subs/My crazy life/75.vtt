He embezzled, took bribes, and raped people.

00:00:08.666 --> 00:00:10.566
If you don't know these things, that's okay.

00:00:11.166 --> 00:00:12.433
If you know

00:00:13.166 --> 00:00:15.400
He will spend the rest of his life in prison.

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:19.766
You, you, you, you.

00:00:19.766 --> 00:00:22.966

00:00:22.966 --> 00:00:24.566

Lao Tzu worked hard to earn money.

00:00:28.266 --> 00:00:30.366

Is it human?

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.200
Don't hit me, don't hit me, haha.

00:00:47.066 --> 00:00:48.366
Can't fight him.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.500

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.300

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.433
But do you know what they fear?

00:01:01.466 --> 00:01:03.066

No money no house no death
