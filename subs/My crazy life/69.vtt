00:00:00.466 --> 00:00:02.600
How to say, you, you are shy right?

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:04.366
You say you are jealous, what do you want to do?

00:00:04.466 --> 00:00:06.400
What are you talking about?

00:00:06.666 --> 00:00:09.533
Long ca, I came here to ask for divorce papers.

00:00:09.533 --> 00:00:12.566
I really have nothing to do with him anymore.

00:00:14.466 --> 00:00:15.266
Are not.

00:00:16.166 --> 00:00:18.266
Mr. Long, this man is a loser.

00:00:18.266 --> 00:00:20.266
Not even the idiot and the eyebrows sitting at the same table.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:21.566
Shut up.

00:00:22.166 --> 00:00:23.866
Mr. Long, don't be angry anymore.

00:00:23.866 --> 00:00:24.966
I really have nothing to do with him.

00:00:24.966 --> 00:00:26.233
I will chase him away right now.

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.300
Tran Pham, you have caused me a lot of trouble.

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:29.966
Go go go, Tran Hong Mai.

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.600
I think you will change.

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.166
Looks like I was wrong.

00:00:34.166 --> 00:00:37.066
Shut up.

00:00:39.166 --> 00:00:40.366
Do you misunderstand?

00:00:42.166 --> 00:00:44.066
Big brother, sorry.

00:00:44.533 --> 00:00:45.766
Please let me go.
