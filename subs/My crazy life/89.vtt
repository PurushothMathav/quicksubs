00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.633
That was the biggest compliment I ever heard when I was 30.

00:00:05.566 --> 00:00:08.166
You don't have to have money to be better than things.

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:11.633
But also has its own dignity and integrity.

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.833
Facing Vuong Chi Cao you are not afraid at all.

00:00:14.966 --> 00:00:17.266
Stand up to the challenge

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:20.433
At least in this respect.

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.066
The toughest man I have ever met.

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.566
I think I like you.

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.566
take care of me

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:36.100
talk about death in heaven

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:53.500
This.

00:00:54.533 --> 00:00:55.900
Just gone.

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.500
No wonder.

00:00:59.766 --> 00:01:01.833
First time you shut up.

00:01:02.766 --> 00:01:06.466
Last night was like nothing happened.

00:01:06.966 --> 00:01:09.133
Who told me last night?

00:01:09.133 --> 00:01:11.700
I am the most beautiful man he has ever met.

00:01:19.566 --> 00:01:21.733
Hello, Mr. Chen.

00:01:21.733 --> 00:01:23.400
I am the president of the market.

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.533
Get your name

00:01:24.533 --> 00:01:25.833
I am a high school colleague.
