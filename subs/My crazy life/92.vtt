00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:04.800
Tran Pham don't go too far, I'm going too far.

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:06.533
Before sending someone to kill me

00:00:06.533 --> 00:00:08.333
Why not go overboard?

00:00:08.333 --> 00:00:09.600
Your life is your life.

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:13.100
My network is not a network.

00:00:14.733 --> 00:00:16.433
Little Tran Pham

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:18.500
I don't want to get in trouble with you.

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.000
Open conditions

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.066
How are you?

00:00:22.533 --> 00:00:24.400
Give me proof.

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:26.600
Just give me the proof.

00:00:26.933 --> 00:00:27.833
What conditions?

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:29.866
I promise you.

00:00:31.266 --> 00:00:32.300
let me think

00:00:33.666 --> 00:00:34.900
So I will say.

00:00:35.166 --> 00:00:36.300
I have two.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:37.633
The first

00:00:38.566 --> 00:00:39.800
Are you dead?

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.033
At first it was for your child.

00:00:42.166 --> 00:00:45.233
I want you to kneel down.

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:46.500
Sorry him.

00:00:46.733 --> 00:00:48.233
What did you say?

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.300
I agree.

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.100
Any.

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:53.166
Any.

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:00.233
Miss Issa.

00:01:01.333 --> 00:01:02.966
It's all my fault.

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.233
I am not a thing.

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:07.400
I am an animal.
