00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:02.866
Why work for someone like Wang Zhigang?

00:00:03.333 --> 00:00:04.700
I have seen the information.

00:00:05.533 --> 00:00:06.600
Murder, arson

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:07.733
Wages arrears

00:00:07.733 --> 00:00:09.033
Collaboration with evil forces

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:10.566
Said to be a scum.

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.433
I heard what you said.

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:16.233
But it has nothing to do with me.

00:00:16.466 --> 00:00:18.966
I just do serious things on his face.

00:00:18.966 --> 00:00:19.533
That's all.

00:00:19.533 --> 00:00:21.633
Is the company's executive eloquence

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.433
Forget it, I told you these things are useless too.

00:00:25.466 --> 00:00:27.800
In short, I have to do this well.

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:28.533
If not

00:00:28.533 --> 00:00:29.566
If not the company

00:00:30.666 --> 00:00:31.766
If not

00:00:31.766 --> 00:00:32.566
I...

00:00:33.666 --> 00:00:37.400
Excuse me, I went to the wrong door.

00:00:37.466 --> 00:00:38.900
Come on, I'm going.

00:00:40.066 --> 00:00:41.033
There is no need to be so rigid.

00:00:41.533 --> 00:00:42.700
I'm a little hungry.

00:00:42.766 --> 00:00:43.900
Help me make some rice.

00:01:04.533 --> 00:01:06.566
What's up today?

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.966
I thought so.

00:01:08.966 --> 00:01:11.100
I still don't live here.

00:01:11.933 --> 00:01:14.566
I didn't say you were too good, afraid it would affect you.

00:01:15.933 --> 00:01:17.400
Does it hurt again?
