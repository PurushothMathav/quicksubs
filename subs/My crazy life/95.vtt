00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.600
Tran Phap, you bastard.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.800
You dare lie to me.

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.400
Wang Zhigang suspected of bribery

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:09.200
Killing

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:10.033
Tax evasion

00:00:10.133 --> 00:00:12.000
Now we commit a crime of arrest under the law.

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.800
Mr. Chen, thank you for providing the evidence.

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:16.633
And cooperate with us to the end.

00:00:18.566 --> 00:00:20.466
your nephew

00:00:20.733 --> 00:00:22.533
How dare you betray me?

00:00:22.533 --> 00:00:24.800
Did you hand over the rookie early?

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:25.600
Right.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.066
Bastard.

00:00:27.066 --> 00:00:29.366
You also asked me to apologize to you.

00:00:29.666 --> 00:00:32.400
You bastard, I dare to do martial arts.

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.900
So if you don't have anyone, do I need to be reasonable?

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.400
Let's go, Tran Pham.

00:00:36.566 --> 00:00:38.200
I can not forgive you.

00:00:40.566 --> 00:00:42.300
This is my real gift to you.

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.400
Like it?

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.066
Thank.

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.233
Your parents' revenge has been rewarded.

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.166
You should thank them for their lives.

00:00:51.733 --> 00:00:53.966
Find a man to live well with.

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.500
you are my man
