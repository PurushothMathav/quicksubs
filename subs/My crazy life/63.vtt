00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:04.433
Say it.

00:00:05.466 --> 00:00:06.766
What do you want?

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:09.900
Not the main thing.

00:00:10.966 --> 00:00:14.200
Of course, it's better to be honest with each other.

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:15.266
Right?

00:00:15.866 --> 00:00:17.700
beat you long time ago

00:00:18.733 --> 00:00:20.066
What do I prepare for you?

00:00:20.566 --> 00:00:22.166
Not that you say it has to be possible

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.033
Now we are talking about you.

00:00:24.266 --> 00:00:25.966
How to be satisfied with this meaning of ours?

00:00:25.966 --> 00:00:30.400
Bom, do you think I will believe you?

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.633
party and keep quitting

00:00:53.766 --> 00:00:54.566
Love

00:00:56.266 --> 00:00:57.633
why are you here

00:01:02.066 --> 00:01:02.866
Okay.

00:01:04.133 --> 00:01:06.966
You let me play sick shit

00:01:06.966 --> 00:01:08.366
Is it borrowing money from outside?
