00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:02.000
Manager King.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.266
You, Tran Pham, he can do anything.

00:00:04.266 --> 00:00:07.033
Don't drive him.

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:10.633
Just a misunderstanding haha

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.500
Hey, Jordan.

00:00:14.566 --> 00:00:18.100
Even though this time it's your fault.

00:00:18.166 --> 00:00:21.666
But I still decided to give you a chance.

00:00:21.766 --> 00:00:24.866
Hey, you just need to give a gift to send money.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.300
Your salary will not be deducted anymore.

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:30.033
Get back to work.

00:00:33.366 --> 00:00:35.200
Tran Pham, speak.

00:00:35.533 --> 00:00:36.866
Tran Pham, what are you doing?

00:00:36.866 --> 00:00:38.166
Promise.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Tran Pham

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:44.300
Quickly apologize to manager Vuong.

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.066
Do you know how difficult your current job is?

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.433
want me back

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.233
Is to give you an opportunity to replenish stock.

00:00:58.533 --> 00:00:59.633
I have one condition.

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.366
Manager Wang, he's talking nonsense.

00:01:02.366 --> 00:01:03.833
Don't flatter me.

00:01:03.966 --> 00:01:05.566
Let him talk.

00:01:09.533 --> 00:01:10.366
Kneel down.
