00:00:05.566 --> 00:00:06.800
Fuck, your back?

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:08.633
What's wrong? It's been half a day since the door opened.

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:12.100
How do I know I'm starving?

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:16.000
Oh my.

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:20.100
Ceiling board, what do you want, broken sofa, so hard.

00:00:22.066 --> 00:00:23.400
Hello Tran Pham.

00:00:23.766 --> 00:00:25.566
Is there no eye power?

00:00:25.666 --> 00:00:28.533
This mother-in-law is here, she doesn't even pour water?

00:00:28.533 --> 00:00:29.633
What are you doing here?

00:00:30.866 --> 00:00:33.466
What do you mean?

00:00:34.166 --> 00:00:35.300
She married my sister.

00:00:35.733 --> 00:00:37.066
This is my sister's house.

00:00:37.066 --> 00:00:38.933
So my sister's house is my house.

00:00:38.933 --> 00:00:40.300
I want to come then come.

00:00:40.466 --> 00:00:44.066
I didn't come out here to meet your trashy husband.

00:00:44.066 --> 00:00:45.466
Guess.

00:00:45.533 --> 00:00:47.266
Call not here.

00:00:47.733 --> 00:00:48.533
Initial

00:00:49.166 --> 00:00:50.666
I said, what happened to you today?

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:51.866
Debt cleaning?

00:00:51.866 --> 00:00:53.066
Every word has its thorns

00:00:53.466 --> 00:00:55.033
What do you want to do?

00:00:55.666 --> 00:00:56.466
This.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Tran Pham, are your wings stiff?

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.400
How to talk?

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.166
Mom said this.

00:01:04.666 --> 00:01:06.166
We were both talking nonsense.

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.200
7th floor, has a girlfriend.

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.766

00:01:12.866 --> 00:01:14.766
The bride price is 200,000.

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:16.400
You give me 200 thousand.

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:18.633
I don't need the money anyway.

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:21.433
Fuck off!

00:01:22.466 --> 00:01:26.033
I told you two to go away.
