00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:14.600
Mom.

00:00:15.533 --> 00:00:16.866
not at home today

00:00:16.866 --> 00:00:18.466
He comes to see me every day.

00:00:21.066 --> 00:00:22.200
Have something to say.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.600
I came here to give you another chance.

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.100
Who makes you want to be

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:28.866
Get down on your knees and tell me you can't do it.

00:00:28.866 --> 00:00:30.566
Only one money back for me.

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:32.000
I would consider not giving it to you.

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:37.900
You don't have a fever?

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:38.933
What do you mean?

00:00:38.933 --> 00:00:40.833
No fever then start talking nonsense.

00:00:40.966 --> 00:00:43.900
Gentleman, you lost this to him.

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:45.333
Who do you think you are?

00:00:45.333 --> 00:00:47.066
you are a bastard

00:00:47.066 --> 00:00:47.800
I can marry you.

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.300
That is the blessing you have cultivated for eight lifetimes.

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.066
You see, I married you because I did evil to you in my previous life.

00:00:53.733 --> 00:00:55.933
annoying, run away

00:00:55.933 --> 00:00:57.566
Is that you?

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.866
Don't think

00:00:58.866 --> 00:01:00.300
You and your ex-boyfriend hooked up.

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.233
I do not know.

00:01:01.966 --> 00:01:04.033
I'm not saying you want me to take care of your house.

00:01:05.933 --> 00:01:07.833
You really make me willing to accept.

00:01:08.666 --> 00:01:10.200
I have this knife.

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.600
What's up?

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:12.900
I haven't told you yet.

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.433
I found him last time.
