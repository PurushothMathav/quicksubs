00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:01.800
His son died 3 years ago.

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:03.066
Feelings of 3 Years of Widowhood

00:00:03.366 --> 00:00:05.133
If not for the fact that I remember her as a lonely, damn old woman.

00:00:05.133 --> 00:00:06.766
It's early. I have housework.

00:00:06.766 --> 00:00:09.266
Not because of him. How could my son die?

00:00:09.466 --> 00:00:11.433
If not for earning money to support the family

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:13.266
My son can't run out either.

00:00:13.366 --> 00:00:15.800
At first, how could the taxi driver listen?

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.066
His son drank and drove himself to his death.

00:00:19.066 --> 00:00:20.300
This little scammer

00:00:20.666 --> 00:00:22.766
It was soon apparent that the goji berries were of a positive nature.

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.700
How long has my son been gone?

00:00:24.766 --> 00:00:26.533
Find men out there.

00:00:26.533 --> 00:00:28.166
Come and see.

00:00:28.366 --> 00:00:30.566
My daughter-in-law does not keep this female morality

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:32.666
Shameless looking for pillars

00:00:33.066 --> 00:00:34.300
What do you want?

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.000
Want to trick someone into owing me 10 thousand yuan.

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.800
If you tell him to give me back my money, I will go.

00:00:40.566 --> 00:00:41.500
Is this true?

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.033
That was my salary last month.

00:00:45.133 --> 00:00:48.266
This year my salary has been given to you.

00:00:48.266 --> 00:00:50.000
I will give the money to my mother.

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.100
You were born to be my family.

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.700
Also my house ghost.

00:00:54.866 --> 00:00:56.233
How much money you earn

00:00:56.566 --> 00:00:58.100
Of course.
