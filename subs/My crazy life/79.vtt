00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:01.866
What good is it if you kneel?

00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:03.866
Make this evil man kneel

00:00:03.866 --> 00:00:05.366
Get up.

00:00:06.866 --> 00:00:09.633
I was wrong, it's all my mother.

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:12.700
The old man will die.

00:00:13.366 --> 00:00:14.600
Next time if you can solve the problem

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.633
Why did he force you to pick up customers on horseback?

00:00:16.866 --> 00:00:19.400
He is not a good thing.

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.233
Doesn't he like to talk about wild men outside?

00:00:22.333 --> 00:00:24.966
If you like him, go out and sell him.

00:00:25.133 --> 00:00:26.666
And make me some money.

00:00:27.533 --> 00:00:28.600
I tell you.

00:00:28.933 --> 00:00:31.666
I have a phone caller coming right away.

00:00:31.666 --> 00:00:33.266
Kneel down now.

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.000
Hey, Truong.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.266
Where have you been?

00:00:38.366 --> 00:00:40.500
This kid slept with my daughter in law.

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.566
Let me catch you cheating.

00:00:42.566 --> 00:00:44.133
Now stuck at home.

00:00:44.133 --> 00:00:46.766
You come here and teach him a lesson.

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.966
Require you to pay damages

00:00:50.266 --> 00:00:52.633
How are you?
