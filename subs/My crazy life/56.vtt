00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:01.200
And you.

00:00:01.466 --> 00:00:04.700
Fuck it, I let you kick me, if you don't kick Cao, that's good enough.

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:05.500
Admit it to you

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:08.866
Mistaken for Van Gogh is Van Gogh's house door.

00:00:09.166 --> 00:00:10.433
Fargo, sorry.

00:00:10.866 --> 00:00:11.733
No problem.

00:00:11.733 --> 00:00:13.666
You guys are not cutting with enthusiasm.

00:00:13.666 --> 00:00:17.133
Um, then I will go fix your house first.

00:00:17.133 --> 00:00:18.700
No need for sewers in your home.

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:20.966
Change your name to fix his house.

00:00:21.866 --> 00:00:23.633
Good practice.

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.166
Don't worry.

00:00:26.166 --> 00:00:27.566
Will definitely do well.

00:00:28.066 --> 00:00:30.266
No one. The plumbing is not broken.

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.433
If it's broken, it's broken.

00:00:37.666 --> 00:00:39.100
Visit in Northern Rebellion

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:55.700
Stop hitting.

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:57.400
Brother Dao is fine.

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.300
Go, who did you say you messed with?

00:01:00.466 --> 00:01:02.033
Don't look for me again.

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.266
If not for today I am smart

00:01:05.566 --> 00:01:08.400
You hurt me so badly, go away.

00:01:14.133 --> 00:01:15.300
I can't miss you.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.400
Peach song could not escape either.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.066
Later I pulled his house out myself.

00:01:26.933 --> 00:01:27.966
This is my Kim Long.

00:01:28.766 --> 00:01:29.833
It's OK.

00:01:30.133 --> 00:01:30.933
Take away.

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.033
What? Who?
