00:00:00.866 --> 00:00:01.900
What did she say?

00:00:02.366 --> 00:00:04.966
That was that evil woman's decision.

00:00:04.966 --> 00:00:06.466
The murderer he seeks.

00:00:06.466 --> 00:00:07.666
I opened him.

00:00:07.666 --> 00:00:09.000
It was all my misunderstanding.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.300
Don't get excited.

00:00:10.333 --> 00:00:12.233
Have something to say, what do you want to say?

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.700
I will call you 5 million right now.

00:00:14.733 --> 00:00:15.466
10 million

00:00:15.466 --> 00:00:18.333
Besides, I can give you my status as a woman.

00:00:18.333 --> 00:00:19.233
I don't care.

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:21.600
So what do you want?

00:00:22.866 --> 00:00:23.866
I'm here.

00:00:24.566 --> 00:00:25.800
Like to sprout wildly

00:00:26.733 --> 00:00:28.266
If you want my life.

00:00:28.966 --> 00:00:29.766
Sorry.

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:31.433
I want too.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.833
Mother almost killed me and still want to use money to solve it.

00:00:37.066 --> 00:00:38.433
Your life is your life.

00:00:38.533 --> 00:00:40.366
My life is not my life.

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.900
Hello, prosecutor's office?

00:00:47.066 --> 00:00:48.966
I report to Vuong Chi Cuong with my real name.

00:00:49.966 --> 00:00:52.566
Murder, buy murder

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:53.900
Accused of taking bribes

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.166
Tax evasion

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:59.033
I have government and information assurance.

00:01:05.366 --> 00:01:06.700
why are you helping me

00:01:10.266 --> 00:01:12.766
90s just got fired

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:14.866
my father

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.033
Make a small bamboo charcoal house

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.000
Used for more than ten years.

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:24.800
Eat all the pain

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.466
Make business big

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:28.266
Finally it worked.

00:01:29.333 --> 00:01:30.700
But Vuong Chi Cuong

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.400
See our family business

00:01:34.333 --> 00:01:36.966
Use all means

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.300
Final

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:42.900
My father was forced to jump off the building.

00:01:43.733 --> 00:01:45.033
My mother.

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:46.866
Also out for a long time.

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.100
So you helped him?

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.200
Prove that the documents in your hand are who is pressing.

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.000
Say it.

00:01:56.466 --> 00:01:58.033
So you're in on it too.

00:02:00.966 --> 00:02:02.266
What do we do now?

00:02:03.866 --> 00:02:05.300
Go to your friend's house first.
