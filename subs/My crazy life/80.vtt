00:00:00.666 --> 00:00:01.466
Incorrect.

00:00:01.866 --> 00:00:04.700
How does this always make me look familiar?

00:00:05.333 --> 00:00:06.900
Hey, I report.

00:00:07.266 --> 00:00:08.800
This is Tran Pham's house.

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.600
We came here to fight twice.

00:00:10.666 --> 00:00:13.700
Hey, we got beat twice here.

00:00:13.966 --> 00:00:15.600
Use them.

00:00:15.766 --> 00:00:18.066
I speak the truth, Mr. Dao.

00:00:20.266 --> 00:00:22.033
I mean...

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.800
Is that old lady trying to play me?

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.300
He said the person I let him handle.

00:00:27.333 --> 00:00:28.400
I asked him who he was.

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:29.766
He didn't tell anyone.

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.433
The younger the mother, the more incorrect.

00:00:34.766 --> 00:00:36.066
Go Tran Nam.

00:00:36.066 --> 00:00:37.300
We can't.

00:00:42.566 --> 00:00:44.500
Hey, knife.

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.100
You haven't arrived yet?

00:00:46.766 --> 00:00:49.966
She said go.

00:00:50.066 --> 00:00:51.366
Will not?

00:00:52.133 --> 00:00:53.400
Not to mention chivalry

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.833
YES.

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.366
How do we get on the road?

00:00:58.366 --> 00:01:02.066
But went in, came back and hit a third time.

00:01:02.766 --> 00:01:05.066
Is getting beaten important or is face important?

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.066
We said it.

00:01:07.066 --> 00:01:08.433
If the end does not come

00:01:08.466 --> 00:01:09.966
That is to say without believing.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.166
How can we get on the road?

00:01:12.166 --> 00:01:15.033
For people in the underworld

00:01:15.166 --> 00:01:16.400
heaviest blood

00:01:17.566 --> 00:01:19.533
Hey, we're at the door.

00:01:19.533 --> 00:01:20.800
Come in now.
