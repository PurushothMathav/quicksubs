00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.666
Opposite.

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:07.000
Tran Pham

00:00:07.466 --> 00:00:09.366
Can I give you face?

00:00:10.266 --> 00:00:11.233
Where is my phone?

00:00:11.966 --> 00:00:15.000
Kim Long called his sister and told him to come home immediately.

00:00:15.266 --> 00:00:15.533
Listen.

00:00:15.533 --> 00:00:18.600
What should this trashy husband say?

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.100
You said at first.

00:00:21.166 --> 00:00:23.300
Start again let me squeeze this trash.

00:00:23.466 --> 00:00:26.866
You see I can't even get one or two hundred thousand out?

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:28.866
This.

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.766

How much do you want to break down the down payment?

00:00:44.966 --> 00:00:46.600

00:00:46.666 --> 00:00:47.466
Prepayment

That's 600,000.

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.600
Almost.

00:00:56.333 --> 00:00:59.600
Later when I need money I will find you again.

00:00:59.766 --> 00:01:02.766
Or go to the other side and cut it like before.

00:01:03.333 --> 00:01:06.433
This small 600,000 VND, does not attract you.

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.333
