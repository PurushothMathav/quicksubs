00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.300
General Manager Wang's phone is not available.

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:08.000
I knew what that kid was.

00:00:08.166 --> 00:00:10.100
I have paid you back for such a long time.

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:12.100
Let you solve this problem.

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.500
What now?

00:00:17.666 --> 00:00:19.166
You go arrange it.

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.800
I want to meet this kid in person.

00:00:21.866 --> 00:00:23.300
Let him know.

00:00:24.066 --> 00:00:25.666
My wonderful.

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.000
My mother-in-law can stay home.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.400
I will go up myself.

00:00:34.933 --> 00:00:36.033
He will not come looking for her.

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.566
It's okay. I'll go after I get my stuff.

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:45.933
I'm afraid I'll die in a few months.

00:00:45.933 --> 00:00:47.833
By then it would be bad for him.

00:00:48.566 --> 00:00:51.500
His husband died in a car accident.

00:00:51.766 --> 00:00:53.200
Live with me for a few months.

00:00:55.866 --> 00:00:59.033
There will be a lot of gossip about him.

00:01:00.366 --> 00:01:03.166
Hey, why do you want so much when you're about to die?

00:01:03.166 --> 00:01:06.066
Happiness is a day, anyway he said he wanted to live together.

00:01:06.066 --> 00:01:07.566
Then live together.
