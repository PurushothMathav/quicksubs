00:00:01.466 --> 00:00:02.800
This was not two days ago.

00:00:03.366 --> 00:00:04.800
The doctor I was diagnosed with?

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:07.766
Hey, Dinh Dinh.

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:10.466
I remember your mother is not in house 13?

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:11.966
Oh, just transferred to another hospital.

00:00:11.966 --> 00:00:14.100
It is true that everyone says medical skills are so good.

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:15.300
We will go to the hospital.

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.000
Wait.

00:00:17.666 --> 00:00:18.966
What's ahead?

00:00:19.166 --> 00:00:20.666
There is a problem with the hospital equipment.

00:00:20.666 --> 00:00:24.066
This side checked and found that someone had misdiagnosed cancer.

00:00:24.733 --> 00:00:26.900
He said this hospital is not surrounded by doctors.

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:28.200
This is outrageous.

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:29.900
Hundreds of people tested in one night.

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:31.466
Hundreds of people are misdiagnosed.

00:00:31.466 --> 00:00:32.333
Not talking to you anymore.

00:00:32.333 --> 00:00:33.133
I go see.

00:00:36.166 --> 00:00:38.900
Is the MRI machine broken?

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.033
So can't I also be misdiagnosed?
