00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:02.100
You guys should eat and drink.

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:02.900
Nothing.

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:04.600
Okay, thank you Mr. Long. Thank you Mr. Long.

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:09.733
Last month.

00:00:09.733 --> 00:00:12.533
Just mentioned a car to test drive this batch.

00:00:12.533 --> 00:00:14.966
Anywhere is good, just a little bit.

00:00:14.966 --> 00:00:19.266
If it's too hard to put in the bag, I'm afraid.

00:00:19.266 --> 00:00:22.666
Boss, this car isn't cheap, is it?

00:00:23.466 --> 00:00:24.700
Price 350

00:00:25.733 --> 00:00:27.700
Also missing 100.

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:30.766
1 million, our captain.

00:00:30.766 --> 00:00:33.066
Now director of Huada Financial.

00:00:33.066 --> 00:00:34.366
only 1 million

00:00:34.366 --> 00:00:36.033
It's not the money.

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:44.466
so annoying

00:00:45.366 --> 00:00:46.433
Who told you?

00:00:46.966 --> 00:00:49.100
The captains are all brothers.

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:50.300
Classmate

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:51.466
Trouble is coming.

00:00:51.466 --> 00:00:53.633
Do you have a big face or something?

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.833
My group's department

00:00:56.533 --> 00:00:59.966
What side do you use to lead others?

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.200
Brothers are brothers.

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.433
You learn a game

00:01:07.466 --> 00:01:10.166
The past can be gone.

00:01:10.166 --> 00:01:12.666
Moreover, Tran Pham came just in time this time.

00:01:12.666 --> 00:01:15.633
I would like to take this opportunity to apologize to you.

00:01:17.866 --> 00:01:19.066
Okay.

00:01:20.166 --> 00:01:22.066
You blew that bottle of wine.

00:01:22.066 --> 00:01:23.800
In front of everyone.

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:25.966
Shout out, I'm an idiot.

00:01:25.966 --> 00:01:27.166
I will take it.

00:01:27.166 --> 00:01:29.600
Ha ha ha

00:01:30.366 --> 00:01:33.500
Long ca this will be too much.

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.766
And do you have any part to talk about?

00:01:36.766 --> 00:01:38.666
Do you have no eyes?

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.433
You don't know Long ca and Tran Pham have problems going to school.

00:01:41.566 --> 00:01:43.700
What problem can I have with him?

00:01:44.533 --> 00:01:45.866
What beard?

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:47.966
Never happened to me either.

00:01:48.766 --> 00:01:50.566
Mr. Long.

00:01:50.666 --> 00:01:51.733
We are all brothers.

00:01:51.733 --> 00:01:54.966
If not brother take a step back.

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.266
Who is your brother?

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.000
You really know how to put gold on your face.

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.766
Be my brother.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.066
She is sick.
