Those are my brothers and sisters.

00:00:02.966 --> 00:00:04.200
Dear

00:00:04.566 --> 00:00:07.833
How could I not care?

00:00:10.166 --> 00:00:13.400
Hey, you beat them one more day.

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:16.033
Maybe I will agree to give you the stuff.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:18.800
What's the matter, General Manager Lee?

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:20.833
No problem. What do you guys do?

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:22.533
What else to do?

00:00:22.533 --> 00:00:25.033
Let them go, there is no evidence to really beat them to death.

00:00:25.966 --> 00:00:27.566
i can go

00:00:29.166 --> 00:00:31.033
Thank you, thank you.

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.666
Thank you for being so happy.

00:00:37.766 --> 00:00:39.200
What if it is human resources?

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.066
Thanks a lot.

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.900
I didn't expect you to agree to save me.

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:52.300
I am very touched.

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.366
How much did he give them?

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.466
I give you all.

00:00:55.966 --> 00:00:58.666
And the money I owe you.

00:00:59.733 --> 00:01:02.033
I'm not getting married anymore, I'll give it all to you.
