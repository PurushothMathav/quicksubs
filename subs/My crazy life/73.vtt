00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:02.066
Are you talking about yourself?

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.166
Living in a high position, rich all life without worries

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.166
But still greedy

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:09.900
Has reached such a high position.

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.866
Add a few hundred million.

00:00:10.866 --> 00:00:13.500
Does missing a few hundred million affect you?

00:00:14.766 --> 00:00:16.066
Result.

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:17.833
Bury yourself.

00:00:19.133 --> 00:00:20.000
You.

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.066
Teaching me.

00:00:22.266 --> 00:00:23.766
You said it was okay.

00:00:23.933 --> 00:00:28.433
Son, I don't see the coffin anymore.

00:00:33.366 --> 00:00:36.566
Son, you are just over 30 years old.

00:00:37.066 --> 00:00:38.666
What a good age.

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:42.566
Yes, what a good age.

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.700
Unfortunately the first 30 years were lived in vain.

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.466
Just the last few days.

00:00:47.866 --> 00:00:51.766
Just be human once haha

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.000
Something like a dog

00:00:54.133 --> 00:00:56.400
Really consider yourself human.

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.200
Give me the stuff.

00:00:59.333 --> 00:01:01.966
I can still leave you a way to live.

00:01:02.166 --> 00:01:03.600
Lao Tzu is a man

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.766
decent person

00:01:06.066 --> 00:01:07.300
The spirit is not spiritual.

00:01:08.066 --> 00:01:09.900
Show him what color.

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.500
Toast like crazy alcohol
