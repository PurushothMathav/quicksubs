00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:05.633
If one eye is blinded

00:00:06.133 --> 00:00:07.966
Are you less arrogant?

00:00:10.566 --> 00:00:11.366
Sorry.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.400
Is it my fault?

00:00:13.933 --> 00:00:15.500
You say you are cheap?

00:00:15.533 --> 00:00:17.066
Riding on someone else's head

00:00:17.066 --> 00:00:20.266
Others resist, look at your sword demon now.

00:00:21.066 --> 00:00:22.766
I'm cheap I'm cheap

00:00:25.133 --> 00:00:26.500
You are not neutral.

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:27.800
Don't think.

00:00:28.566 --> 00:00:32.566
Honest man blows me away.

00:00:34.266 --> 00:00:35.833
Try it.

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:37.300
I know it's wrong.

00:00:37.333 --> 00:00:39.366
Today I have offended me.

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.633
I will make a bottle first to compensate you.

00:00:58.866 --> 00:01:00.666
More to come.

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:02.366
I am an idiot.

00:01:02.366 --> 00:01:03.500
I am an idiot.
