00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.366
Ha ha ha ha

00:00:03.366 --> 00:00:05.800
Long song of the past.

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:06.766
Past is past.

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:10.633
You see, Tran Pham's coming this time is basically not towards him.

00:00:12.133 --> 00:00:16.400
See if you can get him a job.

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:17.600
This.

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:21.866
Such an adult, still unemployed.

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.766
So it is to ask people.

00:00:23.933 --> 00:00:26.900
Ask people to have the attitude of asking people to go.

00:00:27.166 --> 00:00:28.000
Eat

00:00:28.966 --> 00:00:29.800
Oh.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:31.800
Hurry up.

00:00:32.066 --> 00:00:33.500
Come back and apologize to me.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.000
We have work.

00:00:35.466 --> 00:00:36.266
Hurry up.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.033
Life

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:41.766
Man cannot live alone

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:43.966
It's for honor, right?

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.466
Oh, I'm dying of laughter.

00:00:48.466 --> 00:00:50.600
She married someone when I was in college.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.266
Play your big wife

00:00:52.666 --> 00:00:54.766
Now there is no job.

00:00:54.766 --> 00:00:56.166
You still have dignity

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:57.400
Haha.

00:00:58.066 --> 00:00:59.433
I tell you.

00:01:00.366 --> 00:01:02.000
Poor people are just poor people

00:01:02.566 --> 00:01:05.166
Only the rich can talk about life

00:01:05.366 --> 00:01:07.300
Do you know how much this salary is?

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.666
Oh, poor thing, what have you to say to me about dignity?

00:01:12.366 --> 00:01:13.600
Oh boy.

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.466
One month's salary is not enough for me to eat one meal?

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:22.400
Dignity is nothing in the eyes of the rich.

00:01:22.466 --> 00:01:25.400
Right? So which class?

00:01:27.066 --> 00:01:27.866
HAS.
