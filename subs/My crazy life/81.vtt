00:00:00.766 --> 00:00:01.933
Hear that?

00:00:01.933 --> 00:00:03.466
The knife is right at the door.

00:00:03.466 --> 00:00:07.000
Now you kneel down and beg me for forgiveness, I still have time.

00:00:07.466 --> 00:00:08.800
The little knife you are talking about

00:00:09.666 --> 00:00:10.900
It is because of the knife.

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:13.833
Looks like you know him too.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.266
He is a famous boss.

00:00:16.266 --> 00:00:18.266
Murder, arson.

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.566
I don't know how many people have met

00:00:19.566 --> 00:00:21.200
You have to call him big brother.

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.866
Murder, arson.

00:00:25.866 --> 00:00:27.033
I'm scared.

00:00:27.266 --> 00:00:29.100
Xiao Fan, go.

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:30.800
My wife had problems with him before.

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.866
This time he definitely won't let you go.

00:00:33.066 --> 00:00:34.500
Okay, don't worry.

00:00:34.666 --> 00:00:37.066
This time I will solve the problem completely.

00:00:37.566 --> 00:00:39.600
Xiao Fan, now is not the time to say these things.

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.600
Now about this.

00:00:41.766 --> 00:00:44.033
This time his wife did not bother him every day.

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.700
After the evening never come to bother you again.

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:48.366
Not a small breath.

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.333
Knife, I'm here.

00:00:51.333 --> 00:00:52.766
No matter how much knife you use

00:00:52.866 --> 00:00:54.066
You are too polite.

00:00:54.066 --> 00:00:55.066
What are you knocking on the door for?

00:00:55.066 --> 00:00:56.833
Can't you just open the door?

00:00:58.466 --> 00:01:00.233
I want to kick you right now.
