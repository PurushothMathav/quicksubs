00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:02.900
No way.

00:00:03.133 --> 00:00:04.400
Just now.

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:07.133
Mr. Chen bought Grammy's private insurance.

00:00:07.133 --> 00:00:09.800
Company, I'm here today.

00:00:09.933 --> 00:00:13.200
It is asking Mr. Tran to complete identity verification.

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.166
Perform final handover process

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.300
Mr. Chen, please check the pain.

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:23.566
Error.

00:00:25.066 --> 00:00:26.766
I told you so.

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:28.133
He does dirty work.

00:00:28.133 --> 00:00:30.266
How can I buy back the Grammy?

00:00:30.933 --> 00:00:32.466
What a liar.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.066
Scared me to death.

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.600
Arrogant, can't you do something to me?

00:00:38.966 --> 00:00:40.300
scammer

00:00:40.766 --> 00:00:41.566
President Song

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.366
There must be a mistake somewhere.

00:00:43.366 --> 00:00:44.400
Stand up.

00:00:44.566 --> 00:00:45.700
Do not shoot

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.100
The same pattern of two eyes is not the same.

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.233
We have encountered this situation before.

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:52.700
So.

00:00:53.466 --> 00:00:56.266
Mr. Chen, please check again.

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.566
So I can go in and be deadly.
