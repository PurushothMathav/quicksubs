00:00:00.733 --> 00:00:04.366
Last month I negotiated over 3 million.

00:00:04.533 --> 00:00:05.566
How much do I get?

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:08.966
So is everyone.

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.633
People don't even say, how much worse are you?

00:00:11.733 --> 00:00:14.200
They don't talk because they have families to support.

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:15.366
Mortgage repayment

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:16.800
You think this is mud?

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.300
Stop flattering yourself.

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.500
You have several thousand dollars a month.

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:22.766
Don't dare to be late.

00:00:22.766 --> 00:00:23.833
Don't dare ask for leave

00:00:23.933 --> 00:00:26.000
Don't even dare to get sick.

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:27.333
Tran Nhi, I tell you.

00:00:27.333 --> 00:00:30.600
Your company will grow from 5,000 to 3,000.

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:32.566
And kill people overtime every day

00:00:32.566 --> 00:00:35.566
If you do not agree, you go away.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.433
I make you work overtime.

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.433
What's wrong with engineering school looking down on you?

00:00:45.566 --> 00:00:48.066
Aren't you still obediently listening to me?

00:00:48.066 --> 00:00:50.566
Ha ha, you panic.

00:00:50.766 --> 00:00:52.166
I listen to your mother.

00:00:52.166 --> 00:00:53.466
This.

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:55.566
My salary is not given away by anyone.

00:00:55.566 --> 00:00:57.266
Lao Tzu earns you instantly.

00:00:57.333 --> 00:00:58.900
That's what I earn for you too.

00:00:59.866 --> 00:01:01.366
I will bear you for three years.

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.700
I will not serve him until he dies.

00:01:05.466 --> 00:01:08.666
What the hell? Shoot the gun backwards.

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.233
If you want to play, then go away.
