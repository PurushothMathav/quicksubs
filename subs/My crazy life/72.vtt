00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:18.966
Have a drink here.

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:21.533
Mr. Vuong wants to invite you for a drink.

00:00:21.533 --> 00:00:24.533
Just a toast or a drink.

00:00:24.533 --> 00:00:26.300
Well, it's up to you.

00:00:27.933 --> 00:00:31.600
Let's go, don't keep Mr. Vuong waiting for this wine.

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.433
If I don't want to drink, then there's nothing I can do.

00:00:38.733 --> 00:00:41.300
Master Wang has brought it to you.

00:00:42.333 --> 00:00:44.100
Son, what do you give?

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.166
What do you want?

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.700

00:00:48.866 --> 00:00:51.433
Do you know why these fish are so powerful?

00:00:51.733 --> 00:00:53.966
Because they are too smart.

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.633

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:57.700
Want to eat everything.

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:00.266
Forget how much you weigh.

00:01:00.466 --> 00:01:01.833
Adventure

00:01:02.166 --> 00:01:05.566
In the end even his own life was killed.
