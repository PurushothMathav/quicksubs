00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:01.166
Yes.

00:00:01.766 --> 00:00:03.100
So you go find a bank.

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:06.700
Tran Ban, are you looking for a job today?

00:00:07.333 --> 00:00:09.866
I asked you to lend me money so I would respect you.

00:00:09.866 --> 00:00:11.266
Why do you want me to mortgage?

00:00:11.766 --> 00:00:13.833
Daughter in law, Tran Ban.

00:00:14.366 --> 00:00:15.300
You see the truth

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:18.166
Marrying my daughter is a blessing in your eight lives.

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.366
Now Kim Long is about to get married.

00:00:20.366 --> 00:00:21.600
Use your money.

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.066
Why are you there to not give

00:00:23.266 --> 00:00:25.966
Okay, if you say so.

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:29.266
So first you lend me 30 thousand last year.

00:00:29.366 --> 00:00:30.866
50 thousand last year

00:00:30.866 --> 00:00:33.600
There are 40,000 years ago, give it back to me first.

00:00:34.533 --> 00:00:37.600
Is Tran Bang's mother a big mistake?

00:00:37.666 --> 00:00:39.400
When did I lend you money?

00:00:39.766 --> 00:00:43.033
He is my brother-in-law. He gave me that money.

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.600
Yes, it is because you honor me.

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.100
You should.

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.566
How to become a loan

00:00:50.533 --> 00:00:52.966
probably so

00:00:53.866 --> 00:00:56.800
I work hard to earn money to ruin my body.

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.200
When you come to your place, you become like that.

00:00:59.866 --> 00:01:00.800
How much is this?

00:01:01.066 --> 00:01:02.066
600,000 right?

00:01:02.066 --> 00:01:03.300
Yes, 50 thousand.

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.966
I'm fine now.

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:09.266
Come here, damn it.

00:01:10.533 --> 00:01:12.700
Ah, what face do you have for the prince to want 60 million

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:13.466
I am your father.

00:01:13.466 --> 00:01:14.700
I am your grandfather.
