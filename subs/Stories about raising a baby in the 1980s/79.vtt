00:00:00.733 --> 00:00:02.100
Not a day.

2
00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:08.300
Oops Jimei

3
00:00:08.366 --> 00:00:10.700
This is what can be solved.

4
00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:13.200
Don't worry.

5
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:15.866
Grandpa

6
00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:19.066
As far as you can see, you can also get a share of 1.18 meters in private homes.

7
00:00:19.333 --> 00:00:20.900
Let go of selfishness

8
00:00:21.066 --> 00:00:23.366
Auntie, you asked me to let him go

9
00:00:23.533 --> 00:00:26.366
But when Lin Sisi stole my 3,000 bride price

10
00:00:26.366 --> 00:00:27.600
Don't want to let me go

11
00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.366
If it weren't for late at night

12
00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.566
When you are forced to go down

13
00:00:32.566 --> 00:00:33.866
I don't care for the rest of my life

14
00:00:34.266 --> 00:00:36.200
This matter has been handed over to the police.

15
00:00:36.566 --> 00:00:38.600
If anything happens, go to the police

16
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.266
Don't push it anymore

17
00:00:44.466 --> 00:00:45.266
miss

18
00:00:47.366 --> 00:00:49.600
Please stay, stay, hey

19
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.133
In-law, I'll send you away.

20
00:00:52.133 --> 00:00:52.966
Let's go by ourselves

21
00:00:52.966 --> 00:00:53.966
Something at home

22
00:00:53.966 --> 00:00:56.566
Handle things well at home, in-law

23
00:00:56.866 --> 00:00:58.133
I'm so sorry.

24
00:00:58.133 --> 00:01:00.200
It's all because I didn't teach my daughter well.

25
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.133
It will be troublesome after Sisi marries

26
00:01:03.133 --> 00:01:06.000
You and your in-laws educate your children a lot.

27
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.600
We'll talk about this later

28
00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.100
Sisi just takes less than two years

29
00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:10.033
Don't be sad

30
00:01:10.066 --> 00:01:11.666
Stay and serve you both

31
00:01:11.933 --> 00:01:13.800
Hey, in-laws, in-laws

32
00:01:13.933 --> 00:01:15.500
Rich family, what do you mean?

33
00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:16.966
Do you want to break the marriage?

34
00:01:16.966 --> 00:01:18.000
No door

35
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.366
Shut up

36
00:01:19.366 --> 00:01:20.700
He is not because of you

37
00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.266
You said if you had died

38
00:01:22.266 --> 00:01:23.700
What are you doing here?

39
00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.533
If you are still not as good as your daughter every year

40
00:01:25.533 --> 00:01:26.866
Will this happen again?

41
00:01:26.866 --> 00:01:30.866
Ah, do you think this rich family will still be unmarried?
