00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:02.800
I miss you, didn't you promise to get married?

2
00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:05.066
Now they are clamoring to break off the marriage.

3
00:00:05.066 --> 00:00:07.333
Do you want to go back to the city again?

4
00:00:07.333 --> 00:00:09.566
Ruin the marriage between Sisi and Fuyang?

5
00:00:09.566 --> 00:00:11.066
You are too vicious

6
00:00:11.066 --> 00:00:12.900
I am already married to Mr. Zhou

7
00:00:12.966 --> 00:00:15.166
How can it still destroy a trace of marriage?

8
00:00:15.466 --> 00:00:16.933
You don't even have a marriage license

9
00:00:16.933 --> 00:00:18.200
How could I believe that?

10
00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.366
Are you getting married for real or fake?

11
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:21.800
Mrs. Si

12
00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.400
Nian came back with Comrade Zhou to discuss the marriage contract

13
00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.466
We can't because of the fault of adults

14
00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.900
Let children be wronged in big things

15
00:00:29.066 --> 00:00:30.666
Discussing marriage

16
00:00:30.933 --> 00:00:32.533
Since you are getting married

17
00:00:32.533 --> 00:00:34.333
Then why are you selling your job to a husband and wife?

18
00:00:34.333 --> 00:00:35.966
Wife you do this

19
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.166
I don't blame my parents for thinking they want to seduce Fuyang

20
00:00:39.533 --> 00:00:40.900
Nian Nian sold her job

21
00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.900
It's for me and my child to have a good policy now

22
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.500
He has good academic records.

23
00:00:45.666 --> 00:00:46.533
You should go to college

24
00:00:46.533 --> 00:00:49.333
Zhou Yuesheng actually knew that I wanted to go to college

25
00:00:49.333 --> 00:00:51.033
Go to college

26
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:52.833
His humble origins

27
00:00:52.966 --> 00:00:54.500
Why do you want to go to college?

28
00:00:54.666 --> 00:00:56.500
Nian Nian's birth is so low

29
00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.800
Why can't my daughter go to college?

30
00:00:58.866 --> 00:01:01.466
Mom didn't mean that

31
00:01:01.533 --> 00:01:04.400
I just find it so frustrating to miss him

32
00:01:04.566 --> 00:01:05.866
Have a good life

33
00:01:05.866 --> 00:01:07.766
That's also the business of our old Lin family.

34
00:01:08.066 --> 00:01:09.666
Don't bother your eldest lady

35
00:01:09.666 --> 00:01:14.100
Please go back, Dad, oh, Sisi is enough

36
00:01:14.333 --> 00:01:16.200
Oops Nian Nian

37
00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:17.866
I really feel wronged by you.

38
00:01:18.866 --> 00:01:20.366
Dad, there's still some money

39
00:01:20.366 --> 00:01:22.733
It's like a wedding for you

40
00:01:22.733 --> 00:01:24.933
After all, it happens once in a lifetime

41
00:01:24.933 --> 00:01:28.633
No matter what, it has to be done.

42
00:01:29.133 --> 00:01:31.500
Oh, oh, it's dead.

43
00:01:33.566 --> 00:01:37.100
It's because I'm not promising with your dad that I implicate you

44
00:01:37.533 --> 00:01:39.066
What are you talking about?

45
00:01:39.066 --> 00:01:41.666
The marriage you made with dad is very good
