00:00:02.133 --> 00:00:03.833
It smells so good

2
00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:06.800
Eat one

3
00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:09.866
Come on, I'm the one who poisoned you

4
00:00:10.333 --> 00:00:11.900
Almost killed my brother

5
00:00:12.066 --> 00:00:15.566
This woman must not eat either

6
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.400
Yaoyao's stepmother will bring you delicious food

7
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:31.800
Shake Shake

8
00:00:40.333 --> 00:00:41.733
The buns were accidentally steamed too much.

9
00:00:41.733 --> 00:00:42.866
Eat whatever you want

10
00:00:42.866 --> 00:00:43.966
If you don't want to eat

11
00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.566
These kids have been hurt too much

12
00:00:46.566 --> 00:00:47.933
Suddenly be nice to them

13
00:00:47.933 --> 00:00:50.033
Instead, you will feel that there is an ulterior motive

14
00:00:56.133 --> 00:00:58.800
This woman definitely won't do it so soon

15
00:00:58.900 --> 00:00:59.600
Before that

16
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.100
I must kick this woman out

17
00:01:02.533 --> 00:01:05.633
We must never allow our brothers and sisters to be persecuted again

18
00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.800
Mom, didn't you say you would bring back meat?

19
00:01:11.133 --> 00:01:11.966
Meat eat meat

20
00:01:11.966 --> 00:01:13.200
Just know how to eat meat

21
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.500
If you weren't useless

22
00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.000
Did not seduce the attention

23
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.566
I wake up every morning and stay late

24
00:01:17.566 --> 00:01:19.500
To take care of those little widows?

25
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.800
Today, my daughter-in-law came to the door

26
00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.833
You, what about your second marriage?

27
00:01:24.933 --> 00:01:27.566
That's not to say that the neighbor's not the biological daughter

28
00:01:27.566 --> 00:01:29.100
Is this marriage over?

29
00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.800
He's not his own.

30
00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.733
The neighbor's own daughter is back

31
00:01:32.733 --> 00:01:34.700
I found my door today

32
00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:35.600
What!

33
00:01:36.166 --> 00:01:37.433
What should I do?

34
00:01:37.533 --> 00:01:40.433
Mom, how can I marry Zhou Yueshen?

35
00:01:41.566 --> 00:01:43.166
Drive him away

36
00:01:43.266 --> 00:01:45.800
Don't talk about me, those little widows

37
00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.733
He can't stand you either

38
00:01:47.733 --> 00:01:50.000
Just marry Zhou Yueshen with peace of mind
