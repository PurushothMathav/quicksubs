00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:02.766
Oh, what a big vinegar

2
00:00:02.866 --> 00:00:04.800
Who knocked over the vinegar jar at home?

3
00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:07.800
You told me there was no White Moonlight ex-girlfriend.

4
00:00:07.933 --> 00:00:09.000
I lied to you.

5
00:00:09.933 --> 00:00:11.266
So jealous

6
00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:14.200
I am very happy.

7
00:00:16.266 --> 00:00:17.066
Hey

8
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:18.900
I'm so angry.

9
00:00:19.933 --> 00:00:22.266
I just want to know what's going on with you and him

10
00:00:22.266 --> 00:00:23.466
Come sit

11
00:00:32.066 --> 00:00:34.366
The reason why I made an engagement with Yang Yujie

12
00:00:34.533 --> 00:00:36.000
It's because of his brother

13
00:00:37.133 --> 00:00:39.400
When I was on a mission with his brother

14
00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:40.433
Encountered a sneak attack

15
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.033
His brother sacrificed himself to save me

16
00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.500
The only thing he couldn't worry about before he died

17
00:00:46.533 --> 00:00:48.066
It's his sister Yang Yujie

18
00:00:48.133 --> 00:00:49.400
He asked me to marry her

19
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:50.766
So the engagement was made

20
00:00:51.533 --> 00:00:52.966
Then why didn't you go?

21
00:00:54.866 --> 00:00:56.700
He got along with a cadre

22
00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:59.066
Why would he want you when he's already married?

23
00:00:59.133 --> 00:01:01.666
I heard that her husband seemed to have passed away.

24
00:01:01.666 --> 00:01:03.633
Then he happens to be a free man now

25
00:01:03.966 --> 00:01:06.166
It's convenient to go, you forgot.

26
00:01:06.533 --> 00:01:08.200
We have already received the certificate.

27
00:01:09.166 --> 00:01:10.866
You mean I'm delaying you?

28
00:01:10.866 --> 00:01:14.200
Otherwise, get a divorce now and set you free

29
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.666
What nonsense?

30
00:01:15.733 --> 00:01:16.966
I don't like Yang Yunjie

31
00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.700
The only woman I love is you for four years

32
00:01:22.066 --> 00:01:23.366
Not angry now

33
00:01:23.666 --> 00:01:25.866
Who said that? I'm still angry

34
00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:30.433
Then I apologize to you, okay?

35
00:01:31.066 --> 00:01:33.266
No, I'm not a little demon

36
00:01:33.466 --> 00:01:34.700
Not so easy to catch fire

37
00:01:35.533 --> 00:01:36.633
How about this?
