00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:01.933
I told Nian Nian

2
00:00:01.933 --> 00:00:04.200
This job is up to you two

3
00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:05.266
To be transferred to me

4
00:00:05.266 --> 00:00:06.966
But the thought says

5
00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:09.200
He's not a private person anymore.

6
00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.000
So what you two old men said

7
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.766
He thought it was a fart.

8
00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:14.900
Ok you miss

9
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.033
In our private room, Jinchen pregnant women have been raised for so many years

10
00:00:18.533 --> 00:00:20.100
No return

11
00:00:20.133 --> 00:00:21.500
How dare you be so presumptuous

12
00:00:21.666 --> 00:00:23.366
No, I have to go find him

13
00:00:23.366 --> 00:00:25.533
That's outrageous.

14
00:00:25.533 --> 00:00:27.700
I'm also going to ask this thought in person.

15
00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:28.666
My adoptive father

16
00:00:28.666 --> 00:00:31.900
Whether he can still call the shots on his body

17
00:00:40.266 --> 00:00:42.400
Comrade Su, you are here

18
00:00:43.133 --> 00:00:46.300
The family really can't take out the bride price money.

19
00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.633
Please give us a little longer to collect the money

20
00:00:48.866 --> 00:00:52.100
We will definitely return the dowry money to you.

21
00:00:52.533 --> 00:00:53.333
Uncle Xin

22
00:00:53.866 --> 00:00:56.066
I'm not here about the bride price

23
00:00:56.966 --> 00:00:58.166
To miss you

24
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.966
What do you miss him?

25
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:05.500
I should call you your parents that

26
00:01:05.966 --> 00:01:07.300
You are Nian Nian

27
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.066
Nian Nian is back

28
00:01:09.066 --> 00:01:10.866
A previous engagement

29
00:01:10.866 --> 00:01:12.766
I went to Zhou's house that day

30
00:01:12.866 --> 00:01:14.766
Nian Nian has promised to marry me

31
00:01:14.866 --> 00:01:17.066
We're here today to discuss a marriage contract

32
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.166
I don't know anything

33
00:01:19.166 --> 00:01:22.100
How can you say you are married when you get married?

34
00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:23.166
It was one month ago.

35
00:01:23.166 --> 00:01:25.466
Lin Sisi has already told me about the engagement

36
00:01:25.466 --> 00:01:26.600
I'm coming.

37
00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.000
Sisi told you

38
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.066
It doesn't matter.

39
00:01:29.333 --> 00:01:32.766
I want to, but I can't

40
00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.066
Only implicated you

41
00:01:34.133 --> 00:01:36.566
If you don't want to marry Comrade Zhou

42
00:01:36.566 --> 00:01:37.600
We will not marry

43
00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.266
3,000 betrothal gifts can always be made up

44
00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:42.666
No, I miss you, you must get married
