00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:02.000
There is no reason for newlyweds to sleep in separate rooms

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.166
You can stay away for two days

3
00:00:03.166 --> 00:00:04.600
Why can't I sleep in separate rooms?

4
00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:05.166
I'm not coming back

5
00:00:05.166 --> 00:00:07.200
Isn't it because of something wrong with the pig farm these two days?

6
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.100
I'm waiting for these two days to finish

7
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:09.433
Aren't I coming back today?

8
00:00:10.266 --> 00:00:11.566
I'm sorry

9
00:00:11.566 --> 00:00:14.333
I was wrong. What do you mean you're sorry?

10
00:00:14.333 --> 00:00:17.033
Are you going to break up with Comrade Yang?

11
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:18.266
How come?

12
00:00:18.266 --> 00:00:21.266
I'm already married to you, so you're sorry, aren't you?

13
00:00:21.266 --> 00:00:22.466
If you hadn't married me

14
00:00:22.466 --> 00:00:24.433
You can start over with Comrade Yang

15
00:00:24.866 --> 00:00:26.300
What nonsense are you talking about?

16
00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.300
Didn't I tell you before that Comrade Yang and I

17
00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:29.133
The past?

18
00:00:29.133 --> 00:00:30.833
It was an accident that day, okay?

19
00:00:31.333 --> 00:00:34.066
It was an accident that he hugged you at the Civil Affairs Bureau

20
00:00:34.066 --> 00:00:35.800
Hugging you in the farm office is another accident

21
00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:36.866
Why so many surprises?

22
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:38.533
Is there a day when you two lie in the same bed?

23
00:00:38.533 --> 00:00:39.466
You said it was an accident

24
00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:40.500
miss

25
00:00:41.166 --> 00:00:42.466
Miss sorry

26
00:00:42.466 --> 00:00:43.433
It's all my fault

27
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.166
I promise it will never happen again

28
00:00:46.166 --> 00:00:50.100
I will stay away from that Comrade Yang Yujie in the future

29
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:50.966
Ok?

30
00:00:56.333 --> 00:00:58.133
Brother, you made mom angry.

31
00:00:58.133 --> 00:01:00.166
Didn't you make mom angry?

32
00:01:00.166 --> 00:01:01.333
I'm so cute

33
00:01:01.333 --> 00:01:03.233
Why are you willing to make your mother angry?

34
00:01:03.266 --> 00:01:05.433
Who made mom angry?

35
00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.266
I made your mother angry.

36
00:01:13.533 --> 00:01:14.533
It's my fault

37
00:01:14.533 --> 00:01:15.700
I apologize to her.

38
00:01:16.866 --> 00:01:17.700
eat
