00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:03.600
You also saw

2
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:04.833
My daughter is still young.

3
00:00:04.866 --> 00:00:06.600
I have to take care of her job

4
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:07.833
I can only sell

5
00:00:07.866 --> 00:00:08.666
miss

6
00:00:08.666 --> 00:00:12.200
This job was mainly transferred to me by my parents

7
00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:13.966
I'm here to report today

8
00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.266
I got this job by virtue of my ability.

9
00:00:16.266 --> 00:00:17.200
I don't sign

10
00:00:17.366 --> 00:00:19.166
No one can get this job

11
00:00:19.533 --> 00:00:20.800
Have the rules changed now?

12
00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.166
No, never.

13
00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:25.500
Still Zhang Jie's rules

14
00:00:25.733 --> 00:00:26.900
You talk first

15
00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:28.433
I still have something to do.

16
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.500
Hey miss

17
00:00:30.866 --> 00:00:33.100
Are you really going to sell your job?

18
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.733
Hmm, Fu Qianqian

19
00:00:34.733 --> 00:00:36.833
I'll sell you my job. Do you want it?

20
00:00:37.133 --> 00:00:39.400
I'd say 2,000.

21
00:00:39.933 --> 00:00:41.066
miss

22
00:00:41.933 --> 00:00:43.366
You make your own decisions

23
00:00:43.366 --> 00:00:44.700
Mom and Dad won't be happy

24
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:45.966
Mom and Dad

25
00:00:45.966 --> 00:00:47.933
Are you still not weaning your baby?

26
00:00:47.933 --> 00:00:49.633
Find your parents for something

27
00:00:49.666 --> 00:00:50.500
All like this

28
00:00:50.533 --> 00:00:53.200
I personally went to my parents to ask for a salary. What is it?

29
00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.000
Pay Qianqian, I'm your future sister-in-law anyway

30
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.400
Be polite to me

31
00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.466
Nian Nian goes to my office to sit

32
00:00:59.533 --> 00:01:01.366
I'm calling my brother right now

33
00:01:01.366 --> 00:01:02.766
Ask him to send the money

34
00:01:03.166 --> 00:01:05.300
Wait outside for a while

35
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.066
Brother, you are finally here.

36
00:01:10.066 --> 00:01:11.166
Give me the money

37
00:01:11.166 --> 00:01:13.366
Nian Nian has been waiting for a long time

38
00:01:13.366 --> 00:01:15.600
What, you miss the money?

39
00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.966
Do you have any brains to pay money?

40
00:01:18.266 --> 00:01:20.333
Nian Nian sold me my job

41
00:01:20.333 --> 00:01:22.100
Of course I'm going to give him money

42
00:01:22.133 --> 00:01:23.433
Sell you a job

43
00:01:23.466 --> 00:01:25.266
I think he must have used that as an excuse

44
00:01:25.266 --> 00:01:27.100
Keep pestering me to pay

45
00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:28.266
You tell him

46
00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:29.500
In that case

47
00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:30.866
I'm being rude to him again.

48
00:01:30.866 --> 00:01:33.500
Brother, you are too narcissistic

49
00:01:33.666 --> 00:01:36.566
Nian Nian knew you were coming and hid long ago

50
00:01:36.566 --> 00:01:39.033
I don't want to see you at all
