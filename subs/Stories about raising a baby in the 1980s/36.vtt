00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.666
Been back for two days

2
00:00:01.666 --> 00:00:03.333
Kind of like an old man

3
00:00:03.333 --> 00:00:05.566
When will you go back?

4
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.600
Don't worry. I've only been back for two days.

5
00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:11.400
Mom, do you think I'm annoying?

6
00:00:11.466 --> 00:00:14.033
Look at what you kid is talking about

7
00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:17.000
Miss you little bitch

8
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.500
You seduced my son

9
00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:20.000
They put him in the infirmary.

10
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.666
I told you this time you have to kowtow and apologize

11
00:00:22.666 --> 00:00:24.800
I also need to compensate my son for his hospital expenses and nutrition expenses.

12
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.033
Mental damage fee

13
00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.500
Nian Nian, what's going on?

14
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:29.500
It's okay mom

15
00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:30.666
You take good care of Yaoyao

16
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:34.200
Who are you?

17
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.766
Who is your son?

18
00:00:35.766 --> 00:00:37.200
My son is Li Mingjun.

19
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.533
He's such a nice guy

20
00:00:38.533 --> 00:00:39.866
If I hadn't been seduced by you

21
00:00:39.866 --> 00:00:41.400
He won't be injured and hospitalized now

22
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:42.700
What nonsense are you talking about?

23
00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:43.600
I'm crazy.

24
00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.933
I would like a servant who works in my house

25
00:00:45.933 --> 00:00:46.600
And

26
00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.666
Don't you have any idea what your son looks like?

27
00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.433
I'm just as blind as I can't look down on him.

28
00:00:51.666 --> 00:00:53.300
Ok you little bitch

29
00:00:53.466 --> 00:00:55.066
He hurt my son and still refuses to admit it.

30
00:00:55.166 --> 00:00:57.700
This time I must teach you a lesson

31
00:00:57.933 --> 00:01:01.233
Let you know that you can't be rude in front of men casually

32
00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:02.800
Smash it all for me

33
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:03.833
I'll see who does it

34
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:05.700
What are you all staring at?

35
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.266
What kind of storm can a little bitch set off?

36
00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:12.366
Smash it for me, what's the matter, I'm waiting

37
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:16.900
Smash me

38
00:01:21.666 --> 00:01:23.133
Stop it! Stop it!

39
00:01:23.133 --> 00:01:24.433
Open me up

40
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.666
Mom is ok

41
00:01:27.666 --> 00:01:28.666
Take care of Yaoyao

42
00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:30.100
Yaoyao

43
00:01:34.333 --> 00:01:35.800
Roll can't roll

44
00:01:36.266 --> 00:01:37.633
Stop me
