00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:01.433
miss

2
00:00:03.533 --> 00:00:05.400
Mom, what's wrong?

3
00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:07.966
What did you say?

4
00:00:07.966 --> 00:00:09.866
You don't tell mom if something so big happens

5
00:00:09.866 --> 00:00:11.966
I still heard what other people in the village told me

6
00:00:11.966 --> 00:00:13.366
I just found out that something happened to you.

7
00:00:13.366 --> 00:00:15.400
Mom is alright

8
00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.500
Look at me, isn't it fine?

9
00:00:18.066 --> 00:00:19.600
This time you're lucky

10
00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:20.866
In case something happens

11
00:00:20.866 --> 00:00:22.866
How can you live with this scolding?

12
00:00:25.166 --> 00:00:29.000
Mom, it's alright, even if my brother has something

13
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.233
I will always be with him

14
00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.166
Is there such a persuasive person?

15
00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:36.466
Mom, I promise I'll be careful in the future.

16
00:00:36.466 --> 00:00:37.566
Be especially careful

17
00:00:37.566 --> 00:00:40.400
Guaranteed to be healthy and safe in the future

18
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.266
Mom, don't cry

19
00:00:42.266 --> 00:00:44.733
If you cry again, I will cry too

20
00:00:44.733 --> 00:00:47.000
What is this kid doing running so loudly?

21
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.200
Am I not crying with my mother?

22
00:00:49.566 --> 00:00:51.566
Mom, don't cry this time?

23
00:00:51.566 --> 00:00:52.666
Stop crying

24
00:00:52.666 --> 00:00:55.066
If you cry again, won't you flood the house?

25
00:00:55.066 --> 00:00:56.066
It's okay to flood

26
00:00:56.066 --> 00:00:56.866
Let the moon be deep

27
00:00:56.866 --> 00:00:58.766
Build a bigger and better cover

28
00:00:59.533 --> 00:01:01.666
What kind of house do you want? I'll change it now.

29
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.433
Don't listen to Niannian Hu for the rest of your life

30
00:01:04.466 --> 00:01:06.000
What a nice house!

31
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.200
This needs to be re-covered.

32
00:01:07.266 --> 00:01:08.866
I haven't been poked a few times by others

33
00:01:08.866 --> 00:01:11.366
It doesn't matter, as long as you are happy

34
00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:13.366
Mom, I promise you

35
00:01:13.366 --> 00:01:15.866
If I marry Nian Nian, I will never let him be wronged

36
00:01:15.866 --> 00:01:17.333
I know you are good at Nian Nian

37
00:01:17.333 --> 00:01:19.066
I usually see it

38
00:01:19.266 --> 00:01:21.600
Okay, I'm relieved to know you're all right

39
00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.166
I should go back too

40
00:01:23.366 --> 00:01:25.600
Mom, it's already noon.

41
00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.333
Why don't you stay for a meal and go?

42
00:01:27.333 --> 00:01:28.600
You can talk to Nian Nian again.

43
00:01:28.966 --> 00:01:30.500
I'm going to cook

44
00:01:31.133 --> 00:01:31.933
Mom

45
00:01:33.533 --> 00:01:36.833
Love is indeed a blessed constraint

46
00:01:36.866 --> 00:01:38.366
Such a good man
