00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.533
Today, Sisi and Fuyang received the certificate.

2
00:00:03.533 --> 00:00:06.266
I'll be relieved if there's another wedding

3
00:00:06.266 --> 00:00:09.100
Oh, what's so worrying about that?

4
00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:12.500
Their rich family has long signed a marriage contract from our family

5
00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:15.200
Can he still break the contract?

6
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:18.800
Why are you back so soon?

7
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.233
What about Fuyang? Didn't you come back with you?

8
00:00:21.666 --> 00:00:23.200
Don't mention Fuyang to me

9
00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:24.466
I'm done with him.

10
00:00:24.466 --> 00:00:25.533
I'm not marrying him

11
00:00:25.533 --> 00:00:26.733
Who loves to marry?

12
00:00:26.733 --> 00:00:27.533
This

13
00:00:28.266 --> 00:00:29.900
What's the matter with you?

14
00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.666
Wasn't it fine when you went to the Civil Affairs Bureau in the morning?

15
00:00:34.666 --> 00:00:35.600
Okay, okay.

16
00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.700
Stop crying. Can crying solve the problem?

17
00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:39.066
Your mother learns from Nian Nian

18
00:00:39.066 --> 00:00:41.666
If you have anything, just say it openly.

19
00:00:42.533 --> 00:00:44.100
I learn to miss

20
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.800
I'll learn how he seduces other people's fiancÃ©es.

21
00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:50.333
As soon as Fuyang saw him at the Civil Affairs Bureau today

22
00:00:50.333 --> 00:00:52.866
Just say you want to cancel my membership and marry her

23
00:00:52.966 --> 00:00:53.833
What!

24
00:00:54.366 --> 00:00:56.266
Missing actually seduces Fuyang

25
00:00:56.766 --> 00:00:58.000
I have this

26
00:01:04.933 --> 00:01:07.300
Mom and Dad, have you received the certificate?

27
00:01:09.466 --> 00:01:10.266
Look.

28
00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.966
Great, you are really our mother.

29
00:01:12.966 --> 00:01:15.200
You don't have to go

30
00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:16.566
Sugar and cookies in the bag

31
00:01:16.566 --> 00:01:17.900
You take it and divide it.

32
00:01:18.266 --> 00:01:20.033
Mom, you are so kind.

33
00:01:46.133 --> 00:01:47.166
Drink soup

34
00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:48.500
Mom?

35
00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:55.066
Mung bean soup is delicious

36
00:01:55.066 --> 00:01:56.666
Xiaodou thank you

37
00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:58.366
You are tired

38
00:01:58.366 --> 00:01:59.600
Rest first

39
00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.500
Then come play with me

40
00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:10.766
Why are you unhappy?

41
00:02:10.766 --> 00:02:13.500
How can I be happy when your ex-girlfriend comes to the door?
