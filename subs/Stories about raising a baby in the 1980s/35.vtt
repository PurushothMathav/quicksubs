1
00:00:00.666 --> 00:00:02.366
Married Xiao Zhou

2
00:00:03.066 --> 00:00:05.033
You have to live a good life.

3
00:00:05.166 --> 00:00:06.966
Take good care of three children

4
00:00:06.966 --> 00:00:09.233
More importantly, take care of yourself

5
00:00:10.133 --> 00:00:11.433
We just got back.

6
00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:13.666
About to get married

7
00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:15.400
Even if I am married

8
00:00:15.533 --> 00:00:17.033
I see you every day

9
00:00:17.333 --> 00:00:20.966
He won't go back to his parents' house every day after getting married

10
00:00:20.966 --> 00:00:22.733
It's not good for the little pig to see it.

11
00:00:22.733 --> 00:00:24.600
He won't make up with him

12
00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:28.466
The matter of the bride price should also be entangled with Lin Sisi

13
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:33.066
Selfish

14
00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:36.100
Why haven't I seen you with Fuyang recently?

15
00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:38.466
Fuyang has been very busy recently.

16
00:00:38.933 --> 00:00:41.366
He's so busy that you can't even take the initiative to find him?

17
00:00:41.366 --> 00:00:42.900
When I used to miss it

18
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.400
I take the initiative to find Fuyang every time.

19
00:00:46.366 --> 00:00:48.266
It's not that I miss that fake daughter

20
00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.233
Excuse me, are you Lin Sisi?

21
00:00:52.266 --> 00:00:53.533
Ah, it's me.

22
00:00:53.533 --> 00:00:54.300
Comrade Lin Sisi

23
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.000
I would like to know something about

24
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
The loss of the 3,000 yuan dowry gift of the Lin family

25
00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Please cooperate.

26
00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.000
Isn't this thing in the past?

27
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.700
Why did the police come to the door?

28
00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:03.833
What do you mean?

29
00:01:03.933 --> 00:01:06.666
You mean my daughter stole money from the Lins?

30
00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.066
Oh oh mom

31
00:01:09.166 --> 00:01:10.800
That's not what the police officer meant

32
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.900
He just came to me to find out something

33
00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:14.466
Police comrade

34
00:01:14.666 --> 00:01:16.166
If you want to ask anything, just ask directly.

35
00:01:16.166 --> 00:01:17.666
The day your dowry was stolen

36
00:01:17.666 --> 00:01:19.400
Which classmate are you playing with?

37
00:01:19.766 --> 00:01:22.533
Yang Xiaoxue, I went back to play with Yang Xiaoxue

38
00:01:22.533 --> 00:01:24.133
When did I say you were looking for him?

39
00:01:24.133 --> 00:01:28.033
Ouch, there's been so much going on lately, I remember the difference.

40
00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:29.966
It was Yang Xiaoxue who came to find me

41
00:01:31.533 --> 00:01:33.400
Why are you looking at me like that?

42
00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.233
Do you doubt me?

43
00:01:35.466 --> 00:01:36.933
It shouldn't be

44
00:01:36.933 --> 00:01:38.666
I didn't say anything wrong.

45
00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.166
Comrade Dauchelin's forehead

46
00:01:41.166 --> 00:01:43.700
If there's anything else, we'll come back

47
00:01:43.733 --> 00:01:44.666
If you remember anything

48
00:01:44.666 --> 00:01:46.233
You can also take the initiative to contact us.

49
00:01:46.366 --> 00:01:47.433
Definitely. Definitely.

50
00:01:50.466 --> 00:01:52.900
If you plug it in like this, it will definitely plug into me

51
00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:54.900
No, I'm going back to the Lins

52
00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:56.666
They have to stop making trouble

53
00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.266
Otherwise it will be passed into the additional ear

54
00:01:58.266 --> 00:02:00.066
This thing is going to die
