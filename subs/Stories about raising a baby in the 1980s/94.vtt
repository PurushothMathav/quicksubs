00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:02.166
That's right, Director Yang is right?

2
00:00:02.166 --> 00:00:04.300
It's a blood relative anyway

3
00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:06.933
How can you just put someone up your nose?

4
00:00:06.933 --> 00:00:08.800
Yeah, a little conflict happened.

5
00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.800
Just kill your own sister

6
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.533
What kind of blood kinship will there be in the future?

7
00:00:12.533 --> 00:00:14.600
Miss comrade, did you hear that?

8
00:00:14.866 --> 00:00:16.900
Aunt-in-law bickering is a domestic affair

9
00:00:16.933 --> 00:00:18.666
Let Tingting out quickly

10
00:00:18.666 --> 00:00:20.500
I'll make another suitable one then.

11
00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:21.800
Let your sister-in-law be at peace

12
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.233
The director is really a nice person

13
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.833
This thought did this to him before

14
00:00:26.933 --> 00:00:28.500
He doesn't hold grudges

15
00:00:28.666 --> 00:00:30.633
Now I want to help persuade

16
00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:32.300
Or they are women's directors

17
00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:33.766
This realization is arrogance

18
00:00:33.766 --> 00:00:34.800
Miss comrade

19
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.300
Come with me to the police station

20
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.066
I promise as long as you sincerely apologize

21
00:00:39.133 --> 00:00:40.766
Tingting will definitely forgive you.

22
00:00:44.333 --> 00:00:45.833
Director Yang is right

23
00:00:45.866 --> 00:00:48.266
There is no such thing as aunt-in-law crime.

24
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.933
Is this a sister-in-law crime?

25
00:00:49.933 --> 00:00:52.566
Zhu Tingting found someone to kidnap my daughter

26
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.200
Want to extort money

27
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.266
My daughter hates losing her life

28
00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:00.166
Zhu Tingting is not my daughter who called the police to arrest people

29
00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.266
It was the police who caught the kidnapper

30
00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.966
They hooked him out
