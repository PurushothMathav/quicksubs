00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:01.933
Coming back for you?

2
00:00:01.933 --> 00:00:04.866
I heard you got divorced, so I rushed back to marry you

3
00:00:05.133 --> 00:00:06.500
Comrade Yang Yujie

4
00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:10.500
Ok I'm kidding

5
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:11.900
I'm afraid you'll be nervous

6
00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:13.866
The joke is not funny at all.

7
00:00:14.466 --> 00:00:17.366
Ok I'm not kidding

8
00:00:17.766 --> 00:00:19.866
I'm not going to leave this time.

9
00:00:19.866 --> 00:00:22.200
Don't you welcome me as an old friend?

10
00:00:23.466 --> 00:00:25.066
Welcome. Welcome.

11
00:00:25.066 --> 00:00:26.200
Then shake hands

12
00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:29.166
Otherwise, I thought you couldn't forget what happened back then

13
00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:39.000
Zhu Yueshen, I regret not marrying you in the first place

14
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.100
Can you give me another chance?

15
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.833
Marry me, okay? Zhu Yushen

16
00:00:47.366 --> 00:00:48.433
You are back.

17
00:00:48.533 --> 00:00:49.466
Does it matter?

18
00:00:50.466 --> 00:00:52.433
Who is he?

19
00:00:52.966 --> 00:00:54.166
Comrade Yang Yujie

20
00:00:54.366 --> 00:00:56.233
Miss my fiancee

21
00:00:57.166 --> 00:00:58.300
Miss you

22
00:00:58.300 --> 00:00:59.300
I am Yang Yujie

23
00:00:59.533 --> 00:01:01.100
Zhou Yuesheng's girlfriend

24
00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.600
I came back today to surprise him.

25
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.166
Comrade Yang Yujie

26
00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:09.033
Wrong, it's an ex-girlfriend

27
00:01:09.333 --> 00:01:11.066
It's not my fault.

28
00:01:11.066 --> 00:01:12.566
Although it has been several years

29
00:01:12.566 --> 00:01:13.700
But I can't forget it.

30
00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.366
We have broken up

31
00:01:15.866 --> 00:01:19.233
I miss you so generously, don't you mind?
