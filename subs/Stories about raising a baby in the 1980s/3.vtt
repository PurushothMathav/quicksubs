00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:02.166
Drink fast drink fast

2
00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:05.033
Will you open your mouth? Will you open your mouth to drink?

3
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.400
Zhou Yuesheng invited you to take care of the children

4
00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:11.833
It's not child abuse.

5
00:00:11.966 --> 00:00:13.133
In our village?

6
00:00:13.133 --> 00:00:15.266
Than your city border

7
00:00:15.333 --> 00:00:18.166
This is how our kids grow up.

8
00:00:18.266 --> 00:00:20.800
Is that right? Then I see your son and grandson

9
00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.166
Teach them the same

10
00:00:22.166 --> 00:00:25.366
If you dare, I learned from my aunt

11
00:00:25.366 --> 00:00:27.766
Why is Auntie still angry?

12
00:00:27.933 --> 00:00:30.733
I see you because I didn't cook your food

13
00:00:30.733 --> 00:00:31.900
Take it out on me

14
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.333
Excuse me.

15
00:00:33.333 --> 00:00:35.933
I wish I could only take care of these three children

16
00:00:35.933 --> 00:00:37.466
I didn't say I wanted to take care of you

17
00:00:37.466 --> 00:00:38.866
You have to want to eat it yourself

18
00:00:38.866 --> 00:00:39.866
Do it yourself

19
00:00:40.466 --> 00:00:41.266
Come to Yaoyao

20
00:00:47.066 --> 00:00:48.133
I'd like to see it

21
00:00:48.133 --> 00:00:50.933
This big lady whose index finger does not touch the sun and spring water

22
00:00:50.933 --> 00:00:54.366
Can you still swallow with such sharp teeth?

23
00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.766
What are you doing

24
00:01:00.133 --> 00:01:02.700
Cooking, isn't this required by the left-behind?

25
00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:04.233
Prodigal girls

26
00:01:04.366 --> 00:01:05.866
What a waste!

27
00:01:05.933 --> 00:01:08.000
It's always better to be prodigal than these good things

28
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.100
Get into someone else's mouth

29
00:01:09.166 --> 00:01:10.400
Keep what you say

30
00:01:10.466 --> 00:01:12.266
My meat, my flour

31
00:01:12.266 --> 00:01:13.200
My eggs

32
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.600
It's been ruined this time.

33
00:01:18.866 --> 00:01:19.833
It gets colder

34
00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.166
This is the stepmother your dad asked for you

35
00:01:22.166 --> 00:01:24.366
This is so arrogant as soon as you enter the door

36
00:01:24.533 --> 00:01:25.566
Maybe.

37
00:01:25.566 --> 00:01:28.600
I'll kick you out in a few days

38
00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:29.633
At that time

39
00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.766
Let you wander the streets and grab food from a dog

40
00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.366
I don't want to be on the street

41
00:01:40.366 --> 00:01:42.766
I don't want to compete with wild dogs for food

42
00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.766
I must kick that woman out
