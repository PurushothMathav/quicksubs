00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.266
Why are you still wearing a military uniform?

2
00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:04.666
Can this skirt be hung casually?

3
00:00:04.666 --> 00:00:06.966
Who says Xiao Zhou's medals are hung casually?

4
00:00:06.966 --> 00:00:09.566
He got it all on his own.

5
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:10.300
It seems

6
00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:12.533
Some people don't even know that Xiao Zhou used to be

7
00:00:12.533 --> 00:00:14.766
Soldier if not for his leave due to injury

8
00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:17.400
Your husband has seen him and still called him chief

9
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:18.433
That's not possible.

10
00:00:18.866 --> 00:00:20.166
He's a poor pig butcher

11
00:00:20.166 --> 00:00:22.900
How can there be more medals than my husband's?

12
00:00:23.066 --> 00:00:26.166
I miss you, don't have the same knowledge as your mother.

13
00:00:26.166 --> 00:00:27.966
And you know your mother.

14
00:00:27.966 --> 00:00:30.766
Your mother, he is hard-spoken and soft-hearted.

15
00:00:31.166 --> 00:00:32.100
We are today

16
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:35.233
It's just for your and Xiao Zhou's wedding

17
00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:36.700
Since you are here for the wedding

18
00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:37.866
Then give it to Xiao Zhou and Niannian

19
00:00:37.866 --> 00:00:39.400
Have you prepared a lot of gifts?

20
00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.700
If you want to say that Kun Kun didn't bring anything, right?

21
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:42.600
This

22
00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:44.066
miss

23
00:00:44.066 --> 00:00:47.100
You see, you've almost bought all the wedding things.

24
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.966
I gave you a red envelope for your mother.

25
00:00:49.966 --> 00:00:52.000
I knew my parents loved me the most

26
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.266
And you didn't have to pack eight thousand.

27
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.966
Just pack whatever you want.

28
00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.300
Oh, what are you still doing?

29
00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.300
Let you go to the bank yesterday to get it.

30
00:01:01.333 --> 00:01:04.033
Hurry up and take out the money for the red envelope.

31
00:01:04.166 --> 00:01:06.466
This is silk, oops.

32
00:01:06.466 --> 00:01:07.900
Read it

33
00:01:07.933 --> 00:01:10.700
This is the red envelope I prepared for your mother to pack for you.

34
00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.466
Say what you don't give me at any time

35
00:01:12.466 --> 00:01:14.066
You are too kind to me.

36
00:01:14.366 --> 00:01:15.466
Come on kids

37
00:01:15.466 --> 00:01:17.966
Grandpa sent it to you and gave us a red envelope.

38
00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.800
Good good little Dongzi

39
00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.566
Thank you grandpa kid thank you grandpa

40
00:01:23.566 --> 00:01:25.700
Yaoyao thank you grandpa

41
00:01:26.166 --> 00:01:28.500
Ah, this is Qiuqiu. I'm coming to Zhou's house.

42
00:01:28.533 --> 00:01:29.900
He helped me take care of Yaoyao

43
00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.666
Call grandpa good grandpa

44
00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.100
Thank you, grandpa, there is no red envelope.

45
00:01:35.166 --> 00:01:36.666
Grandpa and me

46
00:01:36.666 --> 00:01:38.533
Oh oh oh good good

47
00:01:38.533 --> 00:01:41.800
Thank you, grandpa, you go eat candy, yes, eat candy
