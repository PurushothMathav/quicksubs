1
00:00:02.966 --> 00:00:05.166
Then you go up

2
00:00:05.166 --> 00:00:06.366
I'll take Yaoyao and wait for you below.

3
00:00:06.366 --> 00:00:08.766
Aren't you going up with Yaoyao?

4
00:00:09.666 --> 00:00:11.566
No, it will cause you trouble.

5
00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:13.133
No nonsense

6
00:00:13.133 --> 00:00:15.300
You and Yaoyao are not troublesome.

7
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.600
Aren't you afraid of being laughed at?

8
00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:20.666
What? You're so young and pretty?

9
00:00:20.933 --> 00:00:22.566
But married someone like me

10
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.266
A man with three children

11
00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:26.666
I don't mind you are fine

12
00:00:26.666 --> 00:00:28.266
Three kids is also fine

13
00:00:28.266 --> 00:00:29.366
There we go.

14
00:00:41.666 --> 00:00:42.500
Be careful.

15
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.866
Don't move, your foot seems to be sprained, come and sit first

16
00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:01.400
Let me see.

17
00:01:09.133 --> 00:01:10.900
Come and go

18
00:01:14.066 --> 00:01:15.200
Try two steps.

19
00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.000
It really doesn't hurt.

20
00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:21.600
miss

21
00:01:22.466 --> 00:01:24.400
Didn't you marry into the country?

22
00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:25.800
How dare you come to the radio

23
00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.666
This time you beg again

24
00:01:27.666 --> 00:01:29.666
Probably won't be able to keep the supply staff's job either

25
00:01:29.733 --> 00:01:31.566
Who says I have to keep my job?

26
00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.266
I'm going to sell my job

27
00:01:33.266 --> 00:01:35.400
What? You're selling your job?
