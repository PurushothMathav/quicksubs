00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:01.833
Nian Nian dare not I dare

2
00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:04.733
Brother, you are finally back.

3
00:00:04.733 --> 00:00:06.766
I've been bullied to death by this little bitch

4
00:00:06.766 --> 00:00:08.466
Zhou Tingting, he is your sister-in-law

5
00:00:08.466 --> 00:00:09.866
Pay attention to your attitude when you speak

6
00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:12.600
Brother, why are you also towards this bitch?

7
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.200
Zhou Tingting immediately apologized to your sister-in-law

8
00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.566
Otherwise, you will never come back to the Zhou family.

9
00:00:17.566 --> 00:00:18.766
Apologize, Tingting.

10
00:00:18.766 --> 00:00:20.633
It's really your fault this time

11
00:00:21.266 --> 00:00:23.033
Sorry, what did you say?

12
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.900
The wind was too strong for me to hear clearly

13
00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:26.900
Miss you, don't be complacent

14
00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:29.533
I told you that the royal sister will be back soon

15
00:00:29.533 --> 00:00:31.166
When the time comes for you to be kicked out of the house

16
00:00:31.166 --> 00:00:32.500
I see where else you can go

17
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:38.933
Brother, don't be angry.

18
00:00:38.933 --> 00:00:40.566
Go back and I'll persuade you

19
00:00:40.566 --> 00:00:41.766
Are you all family?

20
00:00:41.766 --> 00:00:43.000
Noisy is normal

21
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.566
Don't take it to heart.

22
00:00:50.133 --> 00:00:51.900
Mom, are you mad?

23
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:54.900
It's my fault for letting my aunt take the village

24
00:00:55.766 --> 00:00:57.600
Mom is really angry

25
00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.300
But I'm not angry that my aunt took the passbook

26
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.600
I'm angry at what your angry mother said

27
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.233
Don't go head-to-head with adults

28
00:01:04.266 --> 00:01:06.166
Protect yourself, do you know?

29
00:01:06.166 --> 00:01:07.333
Mom, I see.

30
00:01:07.333 --> 00:01:08.800
Not next time

31
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.266
The meal is ready, go call your brothers and sisters for dinner

32
00:01:11.266 --> 00:01:12.066
OK

33
00:01:16.533 --> 00:01:18.166
Nian Nian Thank You

34
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:20.566
Thank me for what?

35
00:01:20.566 --> 00:01:22.100
Thank you for pissing off your sister

36
00:01:22.266 --> 00:01:23.866
Thank you for protecting your three children

37
00:01:23.866 --> 00:01:26.166
I am fortunate to have met you in my life
