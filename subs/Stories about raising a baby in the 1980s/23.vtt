00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:01.566
Our clothes are expensive.

2
00:00:01.566 --> 00:00:03.666
Not all little beggars can wear it

3
00:00:03.666 --> 00:00:05.666
Our little dick clothes are shabby

4
00:00:05.666 --> 00:00:07.066
But it's clean

5
00:00:07.066 --> 00:00:08.466
Why did you get your clothes dirty?

6
00:00:08.466 --> 00:00:10.300
Apologize for what?

7
00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:11.066
Our clothes

8
00:00:11.066 --> 00:00:13.800
It's not that anyone can buy it, what's the matter?

9
00:00:15.933 --> 00:00:17.800
Comrade Zhou, why are you here?

10
00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.900
Boss, these two are here to make trouble.

11
00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:21.233
If you don't buy it, you have to try it.

12
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:22.866
And I had a word with him.

13
00:00:22.933 --> 00:00:24.300
Still humming with me

14
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.366
I don't buy clothes anymore

15
00:00:26.366 --> 00:00:28.200
Dad walks home

16
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.566
Boss Zhao, I brought my child to buy clothes.

17
00:00:31.566 --> 00:00:33.300
Your employees hate it when they're dirty.

18
00:00:33.366 --> 00:00:34.366
Since you dislike

19
00:00:34.666 --> 00:00:36.900
Then you also dislike the pork in our farm, right?

20
00:00:37.533 --> 00:00:39.233
This is the end of our partnership.

21
00:00:39.366 --> 00:00:41.466
Comrade Zhou, where are you talking?

22
00:00:41.466 --> 00:00:45.066
The pork from your pig farm is discounted and delicious.

23
00:00:45.133 --> 00:00:46.566
How can you not cooperate?

24
00:00:46.666 --> 00:00:47.900
Hurry up and apologize

25
00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:50.266
Yeah, sorry.

26
00:00:50.266 --> 00:00:52.600
I'll get the clothes for the kids to try on now

27
00:00:55.933 --> 00:00:57.866
Now we're old and dirty.

28
00:00:58.933 --> 00:01:00.500
We have the money to buy it.

29
00:01:00.666 --> 00:01:04.166
If only stepmothers could stay this good

30
00:01:06.333 --> 00:01:07.133
Wow

31
00:01:07.933 --> 00:01:09.800
Don't drop two circles.

32
00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.600
Oh, it's too serious.

33
00:01:14.366 --> 00:01:15.633
Yeah!

34
00:01:16.966 --> 00:01:18.666
Hey, another one.

35
00:01:21.933 --> 00:01:23.500
Brother, what are you doing?

36
00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.066
I've bought my tickets, come and play with me

37
00:01:26.566 --> 00:01:27.300
Miss thinking

38
00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.366
Let me see him getting close to the old man

39
00:01:29.366 --> 00:01:31.666
I will dream with him
