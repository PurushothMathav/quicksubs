00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:01.433
Don't be afraid, Yaoyao

2
00:00:02.866 --> 00:00:04.866
Little fairy, you're screwed

3
00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.766
Our family has connections in the Public Security Bureau

4
00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:10.300
If you're willing to kowtow and apologize now

5
00:00:10.533 --> 00:00:12.766
Maybe it can be closed for a few days less

6
00:00:12.766 --> 00:00:14.000
How can you just apologize?

7
00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.300
Several people in our family were injured by him

8
00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:17.400
He must be compensated

9
00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:20.600
You broke into my house first and messed up

10
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:23.700
You also hurt Yaoyao, and my daughter did it.

11
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:25.400
Why let Nian Nian compensate?

12
00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:26.900
It's you who should compensate

13
00:00:28.466 --> 00:00:30.300
If you dare to touch my mother again

14
00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.200
I will sue you for deliberately letting someone send you to eat the old meal

15
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.300
What's the noise?

16
00:00:34.566 --> 00:00:36.933
Is it good luck for your village to be a police station today?

17
00:00:36.933 --> 00:00:38.033
Clean plating

18
00:00:38.566 --> 00:00:40.966
Little San, you are finally here

19
00:00:41.066 --> 00:00:42.800
These bad guys hit me

20
00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.666
He also beat a few of our clansmen

21
00:00:44.733 --> 00:00:46.566
Do you have to call the shots for us?

22
00:00:46.566 --> 00:00:48.300
It's just you guys who beat people, right?

23
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.600
I urge you to quickly and privately reconcile

24
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:52.766
Otherwise, you will have to sit in the building

25
00:00:52.766 --> 00:00:54.400
If you leave a record

26
00:00:54.566 --> 00:00:57.166
Your family will be more responsible for the next few generations

27
00:00:57.466 --> 00:01:00.166
That's not how it works.

28
00:01:00.266 --> 00:01:02.400
I we

29
00:01:02.733 --> 00:01:04.233
You favor yourself like this

30
00:01:05.866 --> 00:01:07.233
Can you speak?

31
00:01:07.266 --> 00:01:08.266
What is Tianbang?

32
00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:09.933
I'm being fair.

33
00:01:09.933 --> 00:01:12.000
If you are not convinced, apply for an investigation

34
00:01:12.133 --> 00:01:14.233
But not until the truth investigation is known

35
00:01:14.366 --> 00:01:17.066
You stay in the detention center for me

36
00:01:17.366 --> 00:01:18.866
How is that possible?

37
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.500
Nian Nian hit people for me

38
00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.366
Catch me if you want

39
00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:24.433
Don't you apologize?

40
00:01:24.566 --> 00:01:27.166
I want to see your mother locked up

41
00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.700
Ken won't kneel down and apologize to my son

42
00:01:29.766 --> 00:01:30.566
kneel

43
00:01:31.166 --> 00:01:31.966
I Kneel

44
00:01:32.733 --> 00:01:34.600
Please don't implicate my daughter

45
00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.966
Mom, it's okay, I don't care

46
00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.600
Even if it's a mess

47
00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.466
I shouldn't be in jail

48
00:01:40.533 --> 00:01:43.166
Komori, this little bitch looks down on you

49
00:01:43.166 --> 00:01:44.966
Since you don't appreciate my hard work

50
00:01:45.066 --> 00:01:47.233
Don't blame me for welcoming you in and passing by

51
00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.233
It's really majestic

52
00:01:50.466 --> 00:01:53.833
When is this police station up to you, Li Sen has the final say
