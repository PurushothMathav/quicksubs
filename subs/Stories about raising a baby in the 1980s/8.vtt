00:00:01.066 --> 00:00:02.966
New practice, why are you here?

2
00:00:03.266 --> 00:00:05.700
What's the matter, can't I come?

3
00:00:06.133 --> 00:00:07.266
I didn't mean it that way.

4
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.200
Who are you?

5
00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:15.200
This is my fiancee

6
00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:18.600
So you are the biological daughter of the neighbor

7
00:00:19.166 --> 00:00:21.000
Don't think you're wearing a marriage certificate

8
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.866
You can marry Brother Zhou

9
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.466
The previous one doesn't work.

10
00:00:24.466 --> 00:00:26.166
Neither can you, Liu Guifang

11
00:00:26.933 --> 00:00:28.066
No nonsense

12
00:00:29.166 --> 00:00:30.566
Brother Zhou

13
00:00:30.566 --> 00:00:33.100
How can you yell at me because of this woman?

14
00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:36.700
Humph

15
00:00:38.066 --> 00:00:39.900
I have nothing to do with him

16
00:00:41.766 --> 00:00:42.566
That is.

17
00:00:42.566 --> 00:00:44.666
When Aunt Liu was inconvenient before

18
00:00:44.866 --> 00:00:47.166
Come and bring me meals a few times

19
00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.966
It turned out that it was only delivered a few times.

20
00:00:50.533 --> 00:00:52.500
Then he said the one in front is

21
00:00:55.166 --> 00:00:56.600
I don't know what your purpose is

22
00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:57.666
Decided to marry me

23
00:00:58.166 --> 00:01:00.866
But I won't be treated badly if I decide to marry you

24
00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.033
You don't have to worry about other things.

25
00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:05.566
You go back first

26
00:01:05.566 --> 00:01:08.066
Sure enough, all Uncle Chuan seniors call me his credit

27
00:01:08.066 --> 00:01:09.866
There is no future for a man

28
00:01:09.866 --> 00:01:12.133
Just mentioned that the ex-wife is like this

29
00:01:12.133 --> 00:01:13.066
Hey wait

30
00:01:13.766 --> 00:01:15.000
What happened again?

31
00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.033
Here, take this money and buy yourself something

32
00:01:24.266 --> 00:01:26.066
If it's not enough, ask me for it.

33
00:01:26.866 --> 00:01:27.666
And

34
00:01:28.333 --> 00:01:29.600
Thank you for the happiness.

35
00:01:32.266 --> 00:01:33.800
Who says men have no future?

36
00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.033
It's not very promising.

37
00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.100
You have to do it well

38
00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.000
Aunt Zhao

39
00:01:43.566 --> 00:01:44.900
I'm inviting you today.

40
00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:47.233
We should all be neighbors

41
00:01:47.666 --> 00:01:48.466
Aunt Zhao

42
00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:50.766
I want to ask you

43
00:01:51.266 --> 00:01:54.000
Why did Mr. Zhu rely on it?
