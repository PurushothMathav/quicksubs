00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:02.950
What are you doing? The citizen is married.

2
00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:07.660
No need to mix up. Even if you get married, you can buy a first-class restaurant and go out for dinner.

3
00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.180
No, no, no. Ah sir,

4
00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:11.860
You really want it. Also prepared.

5
00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:15.120
It's really expensive to go home and you won't have anything important.

6
00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:15.860
It doesn't matter.

7
00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:18.880
This haute couture piece requires a lot of financial resources.

8
00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:20.560
I will...

9
00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.140
Okay, let me count how many calls you have made now.

10
00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:25.570
Wait, you can't,

11
00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:31.340
Not your words.

12
00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:33.460
Sir, please wait for me for a moment.

13
00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:44.440
How can you reach full size with energy like this?

14
00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:47.320
Full size

15
00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:48.520
Are you doing it on purpose?
