00:00:01.690 --> 00:00:03.350
You are not with me during this time,

2
00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:05.170
I have been public for a long time.

3
00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:07.950
You are a small mouth, have you made money now?

4
00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:10.430
I think you are the sweetest.

5
00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:13.450
I haven’t seen you for a few days. It’s easy to ask a question like you.

6
00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:15.590
Is it why handsome guy?

7
00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:18.830
Mouth, what am I not?

8
00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:21.700
By the way, our company,

9
00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.090
Do you have any thoughts on the matter?

10
00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:30.830
What am I going to do? But people, people, people, people, people, people, people.

11
00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:33.850
Everyone, everyone, everyone, everyone, everyone, everyone, everyone, everyone

12
00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:34.590
staff member staff member staff member

13
00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.870
Doesn't this make him feel more uncomfortable than driving him?

14
00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.870
How can a small place like that be far away?

15
00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:41.710
There is no such thing as a machine.

16
00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:44.600
I've told you before that it's strange.

17
00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.680
Who do you think he offended?

18
00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:47.700
You take the test with me

19
00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:49.220
I am his support

20
00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.380
There's nothing we can do about it

21
00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:53.760
When will something happen?

22
00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.500
I think it was that day

23
00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.620
You and Sister Bai go eat away from home

24
00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:00.220
He didn't expect it the next day, right?

25
00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:02.960
He will definitely come up with something

26
00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:06.160
If not

27
00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:07.860
What happened that day?

28
00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.080
I didn't tell you

29
00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.080
Really, I will prepare for nothing

30
00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:13.980
Is it what he really wants?

31
00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:15.120
Then I didn’t go with you

32
00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:16.660
The company's technology will recognize the promise of ordering meals

33
00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.380
Okay, let someone find it

34
00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:34.400
Speaking of Zhangcheng theme

35
00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:35.560
I've taken care of things

36
00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.600
I'll stop by and see if I'm okay with you.

37
00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.380
I just don't like drinking sweet things

38
00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.460
Don't buy it for me

39
00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:47.600
You are so old and you know how to move pots

40
00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:48.420
Summarize your hard work

41
00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.160
I bought it today and used it under my clothes after get off work.

42
00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:53.600
Let's go out to eat tonight

43
00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.580
By the way, love is all that matters

44
00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:57.220
What's going on?

45
00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:58.820
So how much does it cost to eat?

46
00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:00.700
Buy it yourself and make it yourself

47
00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:01.840
Dry wine is burned for you

48
00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:20.820
Everyone, I will pick you up

49
00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:22.160
I will pick you up and make you better

50
00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.940
Let's go

51
00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:27.400
Okay, enough for you

52
00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:39.200
Is everyone going to announce the birth of a boy at once?

53
00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:41.680
Our people keep doing it

54
00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:43.420
But he was still broken into

55
00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:44.220
One more time

56
00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:45.450
length he may go

57
00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:47.580
It should also be something that is better than death.

58
00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.460
Completely disregarding our son's feelings

59
00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:51.080
Pianpianpian chose Han once

60
00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.400
Why didn't you tell him what happened when you came up?

61
00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:54.480
This time

62
00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:55.720
Definitely not saying

63
00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.900
Dad, what should we do next?

64
00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.880
We don't have much time

65
00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:00.840
I haven’t said it yet

66
00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.040
I see you entered Xinshang Park

67
00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:04.960
Our company is the production and industry Chaoan

68
00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:08.550
The new businessman's intention is still in the news, but Shou Lang is not tired.

69
00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.460
Only we can find that kind of person

70
00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.840
If you can't move, then it's too high

71
00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.980
This is to see if you go to a normal job
