00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:15.940
He looks worried, what's going on?

2
00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:20.280
Did your father ask again, damn him Tang Niaoyu?

3
00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:23.580
It seems that the last one billion project didn’t get Xiaoxun?

4
00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.440
No, I know I shouldn't think so,

5
00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.940
But I’m really heartbroken,

6
00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:30.860
He said it was a lot of money.

7
00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:35.330
Am I not serious? According to Guanli,

8
00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.530
Please ask for dinner at the same time. But I didn't expect,

9
00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:41.570
That store is so expensive, I don’t think it’s worth 10,000 yuan.

10
00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:44.770
I saw that at that time, my whole body entered.

11
00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:46.430
I've seen it a long time ago

12
00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:48.690
I've never had a meal like this

13
00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.470
This time I leave it to my mother

14
00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:52.290
I've already bought food and made an appointment for medicine.

15
00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:54.780
I thought rice was also beautiful

16
00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:58.100
Don't take it over

17
00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:00.120
A lot of money will always be made

18
00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.200
But you are a guest for dinner

19
00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:04.840
There is no human-machine intercourse.

20
00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:05.820
I have no idea

21
00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.440
The first one is also the new general manager.

22
00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.040
new director

23
00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.020
I forgot to tell you

24
00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:15.800
It's best if the new director is vacant.

25
00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.260
I live a great life

26
00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.600
How can he go home if he lets this go?

27
00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:22.390
So I really feel

28
00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:24.390
Am I too stingy?

29
00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:27.370
But am I really heartbroken?

30
00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:30.180
Whatever I spent in the past, forget it

31
00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.580
Don't pull things like this again in the future.

32
00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:33.920
Qingtang is having sex with me over dinner

33
00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:35.660
You should be able to go to the location by yourself

34
00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:36.780
Too cheap

35
00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.340
Too expensive and inappropriate

36
00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:39.960
Some daily sleep

37
00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.600
Know so much about this

38
00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:47.280
It’s just that men have accounts in the workplace

39
00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.040
Don't be too dangerous with him in the future

40
00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:51.690
Not the past

41
00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:53.080
What I can't see

42
00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:53.200
