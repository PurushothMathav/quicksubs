1
00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.300
The relationship between me and Sihan,

2
00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:04.360
Let's ask someone to explain.

3
00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:16.180
You have seen it, even if you talk a little bit, it should be tied up well.

4
00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:26.150
Yes, this is not true.

5
00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:31.430
Tell me, No. 1,

6
00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.480
The only son who eats grains of fried grass, fried grains of grass and fried rivers, said.

7
00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:40.710
Tell me, you are still a boy, too good for me.

8
00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.740
But I won’t do it for a while,

9
00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.940
You are not lying, my god of death,

10
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.080
You encountered it too much.

11
00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:49.440
I dare not go in by myself.

12
00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:51.500
Talk about someone with a personality like yours,

13
00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.020
If she really married a young master like Li Cihan.

14
00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.160
Pai is already about to choose medicine with me.

15
00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.620
Otherwise I wouldn’t dare believe it

16
00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:01.770
I want to know now

17
00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:04.269
How do you get out of this damn place?

18
00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:06.630
I looked around at the escape hatches

19
00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.070
Except for that, let’s move the door.

20
00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:09.460
She just wants to eat

21
00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:11.270
If you eat, I will eat.

22
00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:14.650
Otherwise, you will die if you look at the money.

23
00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:15.650
Die on your own

24
00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:16.270
Should I talk or not?

25
00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:17.590
Then I can go

26
00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:19.450
Don't worry, go out for a while

27
00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:20.690
you must boast

28
00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:22.050
I told the door

29
00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:23.730
Even if I die

30
00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:25.490
I want you to give her Tang Yang to me

31
00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:27.390
Your husband will save you soon

32
00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:28.950
What do you know

33
00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.410
Are you still someone who has sacrificed everything to save you?

34
00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:33.620
You'll be fine when you get out

35
00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:35.760
Let me live a good life.

36
00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.580
A man who can live any life for you

37
00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:38.380
Let’s talk after we go out

38
00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:40.900
Don’t be afraid that I’ll come a long way from now on
