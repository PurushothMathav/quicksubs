00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:05.060
Husband, are you going out this week?

2
00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:08.340
After I woke up yesterday, right?

3
00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:11.000
Zhou An, I have nothing to do with people's affairs,

4
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.120
You took care of it. Were you able to give in yesterday?

5
00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.200
Are you going to solve it if you just go out in peace?

6
00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.450
No, it will take a few more days.

7
00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:25.580
Last night at a certain gathering, we had to say goodbye to the Tang family's daughter, Tang Diao.

8
00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.240
A group of people are like me in Tang Dynasty, restoring Tang Mingyuan's sad atmosphere,

9
00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.220
To find out the author of eternity,

10
00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.610
He himself was obsessed with illegitimate life,

11
00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:38.900
It's not okay if something like this happens.

12
00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.380
Although the old man will have a better time in the relationship,

13
00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:43.390
visible,

14
00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:44.920
You think so

15
00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:46.480
Your analysis this time

16
00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:50.450
We're fucked

17
00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:52.380
Still too stupid

18
00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:58.140
It seems like he was sitting there that time

19
00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.400
I've checked

20
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:00.600
He's the one who wants to save Youzi

21
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.640
Moreover, Jiushui has his own uses.

22
00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:03.980
It was originally planned

23
00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:05.480
Itâ€™s the result of your drinking

24
00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:06.600
Don't let him drink it himself

25
00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:08.250
Then ask me to use it

26
00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:09.750
He really can't stand it anymore

27
00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:11.850
I just found a random man to solve the problem, but I didn't expect it.

28
00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.010
Others can take pictures

29
00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:14.130
It's better to say nothing than to insist

30
00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:14.950
Think about it yourself

31
00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:17.280
Well, since it's him who has the guts to save him,

32
00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:20.320
No wonder

33
00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:23.000
What happened when we met him last night was not

34
00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:26.520
Mobilize, this matter has not been settled yet
