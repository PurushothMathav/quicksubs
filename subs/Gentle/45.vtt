00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:03.600
Want to eat? Stay for a long time.

2
00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:05.580
Come to my office.

3
00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:12.980
Stay for a long time.

4
00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.340
Just think of yourself as a career-minded person and eat until you feel bad.

5
00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:19.980
Sorry, good time, I started eating out this morning,

6
00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.100
We will definitely meet in the future.

7
00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:24.020
I looked at you as a joke and you tensed your hands.

8
00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.100
I know your name,

9
00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.860
Otherwise, why would I go to Mr. Sun to see you?

10
00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.080
If you give him exogenous material, you will be more suitable for this ball.

11
00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.120
Really, I really want to thank my good grandson,

12
00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:36.140
Hello, I will give you a family position, but you have no job.

13
00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:36.720
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you , thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you

14
00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:38.640
If you want to thank

15
00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.240
Wish me a kiss, I can only break the law

16
00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:41.880
I just came here not long ago

17
00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:43.580
Not very familiar with cleaning activities

18
00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:45.160
Take me and keep me

19
00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:46.000
Good summary

20
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:48.800
I was just born not long ago, so this is not as good as

21
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.340
Can find a local

22
00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:51.280
But you stay for a while

23
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:54.080
Is it a meal? I am Chinese

24
00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:55.560
Take photos of colleagues from our department

25
00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:57.760
Can we all eat together?

26
00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:00.660
If I wanted to ask about the main meeting but didn’t eat it

27
00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.000
Sorry, I summarized it later

28
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.040
I am married

29
00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.240
My husband won't let us take him to eat together

30
00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.500
This is not a meal

31
00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.620
No meal now

32
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.500
Don't you dare drink?

33
00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.560
No meal now

34
00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.240
The bed supervisor is really a good woman who takes care of her family.

35
00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:20.980
Then the Chinese people please stay and play

36
00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:22.220
Are you going to eat soon?

37
00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:39.340
First point, I'll book it. No problem for you. It's a conference, baby.

38
00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:41.220
where is it

39
00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:43.560
Why haven’t you given me Baoli’s meal yet?

40
00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.460
Could it be that he wants to make a plea?

41
00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:47.460
Don't forget to keep it in my hand

42
00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:50.520
Do you want a video of our relatives and friends?

43
00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:53.600
I said you want to relax in this way

44
00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:56.280
You have to let me do what I say, otherwise

45
00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:58.370
Not recommended for death goods

46
00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:59.750
You'd better not stick to Huazhao

47
00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:02.250
I don't have time these days to be the director

48
00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:04.230
If I choose you, you won’t die.

49
00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:05.670
If you do it again, you'll die.

50
00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:07.180
You also said that today

51
00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:08.960
Are you afraid of the people who followed her in the past?

52
00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.380
Let’s talk about it after many people accept the confession.

53
00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:18.600
Even if you catch her rhythm, you won’t get any information

54
00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:19.920
Then you are tired after a week

55
00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.580
Sent all her documents

56
00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.990
I will think of a way to miss it

57
00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.080
Brother, I will seek death

58
00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:31.170
Gotta get what I want

59
00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:32.790
If you can be a director, there will be plenty of fish to kill.
