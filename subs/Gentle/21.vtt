00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:12.350
This is even if I have ten men

2
00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:15.550
I don’t even dare to hit the little good guy.

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.680
You trust others

9
00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:10.500
I almost

10
00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:13.610
Why did you say sorry to me?

11
00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:15.270
I'm here to eat

12
00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.980
You've done a great job, people.

13
00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:21.570
White tight man is a thing

14
00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:23.700
This is Chen Jingyang from your company

15
00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.600
What it looks like under your transaction

16
00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.200
He didn't know tonight

17
00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:29.150
How are you going to deal with it?

18
00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:30.780
This matter belongs to Chen Jingyang

19
00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:31.800
You have Chen Jingyang

20
00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:34.780
I heard that person talking

21
00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.660
But I forgot to land

22
00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:40.520
Can have one

23
00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.820
Quasi-clamped in the generated right to have something to do

24
00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.880
Don't want me to stand up for me

25
00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.930
When will the benefits of house hunting come to light?

26
00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:48.210
He's not good as a human being

27
00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:49.550
this matter

28
00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:51.310
I don’t want to go back the same way first.

29
00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:55.360
How important is it, but I think

30
00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.000
Our story is together

31
00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.700
She knows what she said was leaked

32
00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:00.720
but i have correct

33
00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:03.540
She takes good photos of her properly, are you sure?

34
00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:06.150
I want to meet

35
00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:07.810
Wait until my time

36
00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:09.500
Be sure to take the time to do business one

37
00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.180
Then take a rest first

38
00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:11.940
Take you out of trouble

39
00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:18.420
we went home

40
00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:19.160
heard it all

41
00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:22.320
I'll help you according to my sister-in-law's wishes.

42
00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:23.160
What do you think?

43
00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:26.390
Like Sister-in-law Hai

44
00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.280
The outcome must be very guessing

45
00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:30.960
Set up a meeting and check it out.

46
00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.350
Promote real estate and real estate and real estate and real estate

47
00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.550
It doesn't matter

48
00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:35.630
I'll react
