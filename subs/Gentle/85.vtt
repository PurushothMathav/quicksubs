00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.570
That woman ran away and left the troublemaking group alone.

2
00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:13.410
I thought it was so good.

3
00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.030
I am a good person, you dare to lose to me,

4
00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.670
If you lose, will I play with you?

5
00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.090
But you are old and don’t have a bit of it,

6
00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.770
I just went out to play, and now I was kicked out of my life.

7
00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.240
Isn’t there a better solution?

8
00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:30.880
It shouldn't be too far away.

9
00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:32.659
In fact, I'm just pretending that you have something on my mind.

10
00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.440
Hurry up and tie up the bone wall and tell me,

11
00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.350
I still don’t want to change my mind.

12
00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.430
Build a good person, did you know that you, father and son, both have a special person.

13
00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:43.660
Ah, this is the big deal,

14
00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:47.230
Very picky

15
00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:49.930
I don’t cry when I cut official dinner

16
00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:51.030
what can be done

17
00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:58.270
Watch you fuck me and don't come over here

18
00:00:58.870 --> 00:00:59.690
you fucked him

19
00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:02.960
know your business

20
00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:06.020
Kneel down for me now

21
00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:07.530
Ask you to stop serving food
