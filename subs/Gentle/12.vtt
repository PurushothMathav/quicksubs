00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:03.330
I just heard at the door

2
00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:05.150
They talk about it

3
00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:07.730
Who welcomes the mysterious whistle in the competition?

4
00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:10.090
What is Li Sihan called?

5
00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.260
Why, do you want to meet this Li Sihan?

6
00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:17.880
I've seen what he did to me. Do you know him?

7
00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.080
I just want other books

8
00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:21.840
This white lover's business is good

9
00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.050
I thought I was full too, but I didn’t expect it was really you.

10
00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:32.250
This is the place where I know how to be so proud of history

11
00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:36.210
How could your fear of dogs be so popular? He’s not right

12
00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.670
I'm a friend now

13
00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:40.430
No need to be here

14
00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:41.810
Of course I am the brother and the eldest

15
00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:43.070
Manpower is not required yet

16
00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:44.330
You are also involved

17
00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:45.830
How did it change

18
00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:48.800
Who is the little one who wants to dance?

19
00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.760
Shame on me if I were

20
00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:56.340
I might take less trips to see

21
00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.080
Don't know anything

22
00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:00.860
Just feel it

23
00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:02.020
Do you want this group congratulation?

24
00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:03.160
But this year it’s the opposite

25
00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:04.739
The latest luxury haute couture

26
00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:09.240
Look at a piece worth five hundred dollars

27
00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.170
You especially didn’t say

28
00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:13.610
Can you afford this brand of Wari clothing?

29
00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:17.250
Even if he could afford it, he wouldn't be eligible.

30
00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.990
This lining takes away the layer here and that layer

31
00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:22.470
She is my new girl tonight

32
00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:23.350
Did you hear it?

33
00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:26.150
Even if I clean up thousands of you scoundrels

34
00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:27.590
All can afford these

35
00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:29.790
Wear fake or forget it

36
00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.570
There is actually such a group of people at all levels

37
00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:32.610
It's time to roll in

38
00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:33.930
Stop moving. What kind of history is there?

39
00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.930
If you don't want me to marry a bastard, go to hell.

40
00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:40.350
We are the least close in all our history

41
00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:41.920
Otherwise, I'd better leave
