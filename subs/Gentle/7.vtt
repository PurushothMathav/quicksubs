00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:03.280
Are you playing games?

2
00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.130
You are all music, who is this person? Or music?

3
00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:15.350
Do you still know this?

4
00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:18.010
Then what do you think is a good person who has fought and done well?

5
00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.750
should be made.

6
00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:22.790
That's not what I meant, what I meant was,

7
00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:25.190
You didnâ€™t expect that you understood and listened.

8
00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:31.760
You need to know me, I mean you,

9
00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:35.380
You know what you want to say,

10
00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:36.730
Definitely reminds me of it.

11
00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:40.840
She's not in the highest interest

12
00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:42.440
There are really too many kinds

13
00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:48.180
How do you buy it among others?

14
00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:52.190
How about we come together again and have enough?

15
00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:54.160
Here are these

16
00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.870
Here are these

17
00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:55.430
Letâ€™s talk here

18
00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:57.350
How do other couples talk?

19
00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:21.370
I am a bed-ridden person, so I donâ€™t understand you.

20
00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:24.510
Are you tired today?

21
00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:25.350
no thank you

22
00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:33.580
Then I said it

23
00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:36.450
Sounds a little lost

24
00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:12.230
How about I give it to you and let others listen?

25
00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:14.240
are your father's eyes
