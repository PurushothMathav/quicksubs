00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.650
This is not good, the old man can't help it.

2
00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:23.080
Your name has been shouting here, okay,

3
00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:25.340
Why don't you come and liven things up?

4
00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:28.200
Don't be in a hurry to become a coach. You deliberately don't know that you know about my business.

5
00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:30.320
It seems that at least my second uncle is eating,

6
00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:33.250
It's less for you, and the climate is also strong.

7
00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:35.810
You'd better watch your Islam fall into your trap, old man.

8
00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:38.010
No matter how hard you work, I won't bring you back.

9
00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.410
I thought you were playing the same game as before,

10
00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:25.530
Last time I heard that you held some kind of flight selection conference like this,

11
00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:27.550
I was injured by Chengxiaqun, but it’s okay,

12
00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.850
It's okay, otherwise I would have done it,

13
00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:30.770
He felt distressed.

14
00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:34.330
So thoughtful and thoughtful

15
00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:36.610
You said it yourself

16
00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:39.040
Just asking this

17
00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:44.410
Thank you for giving me this key

18
00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:45.210
It's hard to be good

19
00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.730
Your property belongs to me

20
00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:48.070
I was fucked all the time

21
00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:48.690
Speaking of which

22
00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:49.650
I still have to thank you

23
00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:51.470
I am now in a relationship with the old man.

24
00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:52.520
Old student is behind

25
00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.300
Why don't you send grandpa to the hospital quickly?

26
00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:57.140
Establishing a medical society

27
00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.140
Which hospital can I compare?

28
00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:01.310
You also know, old man

29
00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:02.270
He is most afraid of him

30
00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:04.570
On the way to the hospital in case of emergency

31
00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:06.050
I remember to shine

32
00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:08.190
You want to buy our stock?

33
00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:11.680
That's not good. You said it's a big responsibility.

34
00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:14.260
It’s the sincerity of grandpa

35
00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:29.270
Grandpa's principle has always been friendship. Who are you?

36
00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:32.710
Why haven't I seen you? It's just

37
00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.170
The host of Qing Yisheng was revealed

38
00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:37.970
This is Qing Yisheng’s colleague

39
00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:39.550
And there are also fellow seniors

40
00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:40.830
Just take the initiative to do your homework.

41
00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:42.430
Just tell the old man and stop messing around.

42
00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.240
Then you can be nice

43
00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:47.480
What did you say this time?

44
00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:48.820
Will the old man be okay now?

45
00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:50.120
You go and be the host and a volunteer and leave.

46
00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:51.900
In case the old man has someone to like, investigate two cases

47
00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:56.010
How many losses have you incurred? Mr.

48
00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:57.400
Hundreds of millions of students have already been exposed to currency

49
00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:58.560
How old is this old man’s room?

50
00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:01.320
I mean, I'm already undergoing treatment now.

51
00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.200
What do you mean?

52
00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.080
Grandpa is also used to love doctors

53
00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.160
I only believe in love doctors

54
00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:09.390
I'm afraid that after he changes doctors

55
00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:12.670
The body posture method makes it more interesting.

56
00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:15.270
Are you saying that I ruined my own in-laws at home?

57
00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:18.700
I didn't say that

58
00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:23.070
It's not the doctor you mentioned just now who can't take the initiative to love you.

59
00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:26.000
Was this really arranged by you?
