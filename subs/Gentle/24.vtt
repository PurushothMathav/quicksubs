00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.310
What to do?

2
00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:05.130
Not big or small. I said your second uncle,

3
00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:08.230
How dare you talk to me like that?

4
00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:13.230
Second uncle, even if you don’t emphasize it,

5
00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:15.490
I also know that after you spoke,

6
00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:20.930
The second uncle who tampered with me on my private plane,

7
00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:24.480
Go send someone to your nonsense.

8
00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:28.170
You, what you said, my mother will settle the account for the lost plane with you.

9
00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:31.430
But do you dare to use your grandfather’s body to see the Master?

10
00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:33.030
I'm going to kill you.

11
00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:36.620
You return this favor, the old man is my biological father.

12
00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:37.340
How could I,

13
00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:41.700
Li Zhan hates you. Please tell me I'll come back.

14
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.260
Everything that belongs to me is mine

15
00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.640
Don't go in without eating and serving.

16
00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.360
Come in and I'll call you Young Uncle

17
00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:55.480
Serve, I can just find the courier, Ma Yun, you can handle it yourself

18
00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:57.000
You don’t want Mr. Zhang Nuo

19
00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.060
The first episode of "Hui Ming" sold out like this

20
00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:59.160
The old man hasn’t said anything yet

21
00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.620
Let me talk to you about your home

22
00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:01.960
Don't put food in front of me

23
00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.340
A plane losing power can also kill people

24
00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:05.850
That's not what you did

25
00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.450
Do you think you should kill me?

26
00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:12.050
You can kill me for this harm

27
00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:13.490
Speak with evidence

28
00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:15.370
Don't think you are talking about my knowledge

29
00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.850
I don't dare to sue him anymore.

30
00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:20.930
Where we establish paternal authority

31
00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:22.630
It has always been a secret arrangement

32
00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:23.910
Forget it

33
00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:25.220
It has to be me

34
00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:26.420
You are amazing

35
00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.080
It's my thing

36
00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.080
I'll take it back

37
00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:34.640
Even if you are using the old watch, you are worthy of coming, so I say

38
00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:35.720
Don't say anything

39
00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.020
I have to kill you to kill Bei.

40
00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.880
There is an inorganic talk

41
00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:39.660
I am the old man's son

42
00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:40.780
you are grandson

43
00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:43.400
Do you understand that you filmed me from behind?

44
00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:44.360
What if grandpa

45
00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.240
He is lively

46
00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:49.340
You really made me laugh to death

47
00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:51.100
Learn to speak big words

48
00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:52.920
If we talk about the old man

49
00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:53.720
Bring your home to your door

50
00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:55.160
That person will talk to you

51
00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:56.800
I won't whistle for you

52
00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:58.900
Come on, that's it
