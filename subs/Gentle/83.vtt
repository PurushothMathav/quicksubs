00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:05.340
What is it? You already know everything.

2
00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:07.160
You see her true identity.

3
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.800
You're asking me to go to dinner. Aren't these three traffic deputies?

4
00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:13.360
That's not marriage, right?

5
00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:16.280
This person can't run away from you. Is this girl the one?

6
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.840
I'm really old for you. Ask you these more,

7
00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:21.780
If you are still implicated by the website, then you are still limited,

8
00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.810
I should be disgusted.

9
00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:26.210
Even if you continue like this, I won't be able to get back to you.

10
00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.720
This is what people in a small room look like, it doesn’t look like this,

11
00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:32.960
Does she know that she is a girl on purpose?

12
00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.350
Like it's really not like that,

13
00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:37.750
Yes, I don’t even want to eat now.

14
00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:42.720
You will have someone come over to provide you with return service.

15
00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:44.020
Aren't these just wearing cats?

16
00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:45.830
what do I do

17
00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:48.840
None of these are right

18
00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.220
If you want to leave

19
00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:51.520
Just leave first

20
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:52.940
You're so right

21
00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:54.920
I will always come to save me quickly

22
00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:55.660
How are you too?

23
00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:57.020
Stop doing this

24
00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:58.660
Where is your next family member?

25
00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:59.300
if you would leave

26
00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:00.920
I definitely provide good people

27
00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:01.540
will you

28
00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:03.060
You have to wait for yourself

29
00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:03.980
Will you wait a moment?
