00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:04.380
Protecting you is back. Laughed at me.

2
00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:06.720
Miss your husband, do you know?

3
00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.660
I really don’t pursue it anymore for a long time,

4
00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.720
And he will never return to the company.

5
00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:11.920
How did you do that?

6
00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.140
Nothing, do you have the direction of the road in your hand?

7
00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:16.100
After all, he wanted to join the company.

8
00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:21.070
Yes. The important thing is that I'm okay. Yes.

9
00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:26.340
I'm going to Jiangcheng in the next few days. There's a competition.

10
00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:30.180
I'm not at home, you and others take care of yourself. Yes.

11
00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:33.720
You are like this anyway, and you don’t even ask me when I will come back.

12
00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:35.300
Are you going to compete?

13
00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:36.460
you are over

14
00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:37.740
I'm sure I'll be back

15
00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.420
In addition to fully supporting you

16
00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:40.760
What else can be done

17
00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:47.660
How many days is it?

18
00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.240
I also want to know why it’s been so long for three years.

19
00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:56.730
Did you say work?

20
00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.070
I will definitely support it

21
00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:00.320
But I ordered them all

22
00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:05.060
I like you so much. Big talk.

23
00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.280
Do you know all the ratios?

24
00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:08.520
movement in motion

25
00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:12.410
What memory should be paid attention to in sports competitions?

26
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.360
It's all your fault

27
00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:16.170
I can't help but save people

28
00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.680
Stay with you every day

29
00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.480
How do you answer this sentence?

30
00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:21.080
Then stop talking

31
00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:34.630
You choose what you mean
