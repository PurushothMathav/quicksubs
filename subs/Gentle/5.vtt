00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:07.870
When we got married, we didn’t give you any lavish betrothal gifts.

2
00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:12.220
This means I won't give it to you.

3
00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:18.670
This means I won't give it to you.

4
00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:20.390
This means I won't give it to you.

5
00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:24.580
This can be regarded as my not giving it to you. This can be regarded as my not giving it to you.

6
00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:26.380
This means I won't give it to you.

7
00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:31.400
This means I won't give it to you.

8
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.080
This counts as my not giving it to you. This counts as my not giving it to you. This counts as my not giving it to you. This counts as my not giving it to you. This counts as my not giving it to you. This counts as my not giving it to you. This counts as my not giving it to you. I won't give it to you. This is me

9
00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:34.790
I won’t give it to you. I won’t give it to you. I won’t give it to you. I won’t give it to you.

10
00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:36.510
It's up to you. This means I won't give it to you.

11
00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.750
This means I won't give it to you.

12
00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:45.800
This is what I don’t

13
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.440
This way I can keep others from worrying

14
00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:49.840
I know he isn't, right?

15
00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.350
You go and do your business

16
00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:53.450
I'm bored

17
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:55.420
Such a number one

18
00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:57.290
I am not Tang Ya’s identity

19
00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:58.810
Is it possible to get dressed up so quickly?

20
00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.019
That one didn't come back

21
00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:07.660
How does it feel to get married? I heard

22
00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:08.920
People of one generation get married

23
00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:10.180
As a parent

24
00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:11.760
I have never been married before.

25
00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.300
The other party has grown an industry

26
00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:14.910
You are married

27
00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:16.510
The body is boneless

28
00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:19.670
It was so early when I came back to find half of the dowry.

29
00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:20.890
You came back today

30
00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:22.330
You went out early

31
00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.980
What did you say

32
00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:25.200
That kind of person you marry

33
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.020
Isn’t that enough?

34
00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:29.050
Do you still think that we can't come back to you if we say goodbye?

35
00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:30.210
No need to look back at the door

36
00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.470
I only want my dowry

37
00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.670
It costs 300,000 for me to marry you.

38
00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:34.750
What dowry

39
00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:36.930
What is the heat dissipation?

40
00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.550
I've never heard of it

41
00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:40.530
What are you afraid of me seeing?

42
00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:42.970
Look at you checking cards with that Huiwen guy

43
00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:45.720
It's your wedding day

44
00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.900
Talk about the daughter who got married

45
00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:48.960
water from marriage

46
00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:50.610
You and our cousin

47
00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.230
It doesn't matter at all

48
00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.000
It's okay, you promised me

49
00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.720
You want me to marry you

50
00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:57.880
Just give me the three hundred thousand

51
00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.200
But let my mother be in the good life room

52
00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.620
Take the secret drug

53
00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.100
Where is my silly sister?

54
00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:05.200
Don't forget

55
00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.040
Back then, when a girl got married, her mother was more than ready for my dad.

56
00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.960
Why don't you take care of your mother first?

57
00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:11.140
Don't mess with dogs

58
00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:12.460
Let dad send Lepi away

59
00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.700
It’s time to go to the moon first

60
00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.880
My parents don't understand how your mother died.

61
00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:18.100
How could you possibly save me?

62
00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:21.120
My mother is not that kind of person

63
00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.000
What is going on with this younger generation?

64
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.400
Because I don't even know

65
00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.980
So please pay attention to your words

66
00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:29.920
If you dare to disrespect my mother again

67
00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:30.980
I helped you

68
00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:33.490
Then you must have that ability too

69
00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:38.670
I see you are not in love. Are you beautiful? Tell me.

70
00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.220
It happens to be used in your home

71
00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:44.900
Not that

72
00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.530
Like dad

73
00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:47.190
I have no plans for your home.

74
00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:48.540
Your substitute

75
00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.000
Already bought it for a medical doctor

76
00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:51.570
Don't give it to you, don't connect it

77
00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:53.490
I'll drive you out when you're far away

78
00:02:53.490 --> 00:03:01.670
Miss Tang is out

79
00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:02.890
how is he

80
00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:04.100
doesn't look good

81
00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:05.520
I guess I was angry when I was there

82
00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:06.380
I checked

83
00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:07.460
He didn't ask for company

84
00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:09.140
That was punished by Tang Yongshu

85
00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:11.360
How much is 300,000 yuan for him?

86
00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:16.980
The Tang family's piece of land is only a few and one is very good.

87
00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:18.940
Then use this piece of land

88
00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:20.770
Let those old people from the Tang family

89
00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:22.090
This is not a useful person

90
00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:23.310
Give it all to me

91
00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:24.610
cleaning cleaning

92
00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.950
Why CEO?

93
00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:26.770
But I've been here

94
00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:30.010
As soon as you get married, you should be serious about it.

95
00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:31.730
Come on up so quickly!
