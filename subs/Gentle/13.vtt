00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:02.070
Let's go, let's go,

2
00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:04.510
Don't be afraid, I bought them all.

3
00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:09.340
It must be real, you bought it,

4
00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.700
What you mean is that you are a fart,

5
00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.480
Laughing to death, how did he come from Li Shao?

6
00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:16.620
I've seen your oral secrets, right?

7
00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.920
My husband doesn’t know anything, okay,

8
00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.480
Don't ask the man, you are his husband who has done it.

9
00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.850
It's better to switch to Yuan Ming, who is very good at talking about it.

10
00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:27.970
These don’t make me blush at all,

11
00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.210
I said this little suggestion is to go and change,

12
00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.530
It turns out that it’s so fast to take over your reputation.

13
00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:37.390
I see that your chat hole was borrowed by Zu Pan to collect things.

14
00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:38.590
This is your kind

15
00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:40.890
I really have to work too hard to find a director to attend the meeting.

16
00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.150
Follow up

17
00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:43.970
You are the ones who lost the guide thorn

18
00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:48.170
I'd like to see who brought Hoss like you.

19
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.200
you all

20
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.900
I understand that tonight’s protagonist is a young man from the Han Dynasty.

21
00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:58.410
For those who didn’t know, I really thought it was you.

22
00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:59.850
I have no chance with her.

23
00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:02.830
She thought of becoming so small today?

24
00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:04.150
You want to please people but you won't be able to leave.

25
00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:05.840
You won't ask our eyes

26
00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:07.160
Say sorry to me

27
00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:08.160
You also shoot

28
00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.300
They are all in your family

29
00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:11.600
You can't do it please

30
00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:13.230
Packing for the day

31
00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:15.570
Waiting for the old man to pull away from the photos and cum

32
00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.530
What do you call yourself like this?

33
00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:19.670
You should be more familiar than me

34
00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:24.920
He didn't think of rushing to almost that person, please leave.

35
00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.800
It's like I don't want it anymore

36
00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:29.850
This is where you are tonight

37
00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:31.500
No one is allowed to go
