00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:04.110
Hou Kong, when will I wake up?

2
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.200
I have been sleeping for a month,

3
00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:13.450
I think, I want to tell you about what happened next.

4
00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:15.530
Okay, are you awake?

5
00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:18.800
Look at me really hard, those things that hurt you,

6
00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.050
It has already relapsed, and your drinking habits are very low for future generations,

7
00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.890
I have to work hard for the rest of my life.

8
00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:27.570
Another good thing is happening,

9
00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:30.600
He also woke up and I saw him,

10
00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:37.630
He is really a very thoughtful old man. Accompany my mother

11
00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:39.740
My mother's condition is also getting better

12
00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.950
Can she recognize me? She also said

13
00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:45.010
Let me remember her next time

14
00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:47.050
I also saw

15
00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:49.660
I'm willing to be secretly with Fang Yan

16
00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:50.880
I'm willing to be secretly with Fang Yan

17
00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:54.740
I am willing to work in the lighting system

18
00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.800
Do you know the possibility of good news? No, no.

19
00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:18.420
You were famous and had a very high reputation at that time.

20
00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:27.370
It's the surgeon's name that makes him famous.

21
00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.660
In fact, we have known each other a long time ago

22
00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:34.360
Because it will save you if you try flying now.

23
00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:37.720
That's what it turns out to be

24
00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:40.440
Soul Man is written by a man, so

25
00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:43.600
The secret brought us together from that moment on

26
00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:50.510
Been here because I love you
