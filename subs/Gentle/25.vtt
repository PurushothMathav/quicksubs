00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:13.110
Dad, can I come back?

2
00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:18.340
I turned out to be fine.

3
00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:23.030
You have not been in your company's night grade for more than a year.

4
00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.100
What a way out for a young person.

5
00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.080
You are needed.

6
00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.430
Dad, what do you mean by this?

7
00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:32.850
Over the years, you have been investing.

8
00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:35.170
This investment naturally takes time.

9
00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:37.270
Next year, it will definitely be St. Petersburg, you are waiting for a while.

10
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.420
OK. What investment are you talking about?

11
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.340
You have been with me for more than a year,

12
00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:45.880
You are dozens and dozens of one,

13
00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:47.220
You still have years to say.

14
00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.540
You can use that to play a role

15
00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:52.310
As a result, you can do it for a while

16
00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:54.590
It would be better to wait until I am three

17
00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:56.870
I'll leave the press early and wait for a while

18
00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:02.340
Announce that you are the new eldest son of your family

19
00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:06.020
It's not fair grandpa

20
00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:08.040
You are in good health

21
00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.520
It can also be made into something that has a history of several decades

22
00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:11.660
What about the elders?

23
00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:12.800
No need to grow a few for me

24
00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:14.710
I have decided

25
00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:16.280
Dad I don't agree

26
00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:18.640
It's easy for me to bring in consultants who also have some history.

27
00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:19.980
as an ancient movement in history

28
00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:22.720
I don't understand this about you

29
00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:24.690
No need for your consent

30
00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.180
You are giving me 65% of the shares

31
00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.240
I will give everything to Si'an

32
00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.620
Plus four dishes in hand

33
00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:37.300
Add enough water to its outdated shares

34
00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:39.630
It’s also 80%

35
00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:40.930
four position

36
00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:42.150
is anyone

37
00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.910
I have nothing to do with you either

38
00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:45.770
I don’t need to ask you about this.

39
00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:49.670
It’s good for dad that you take good care of yourself today.

40
00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:51.230
All four players are correct

41
00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:52.070
Don't remember it yet

42
00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:52.950
I'll put some Sihan

43
00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.840
Let’s just say he’s very young.

44
00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:55.680
this year

45
00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:56.580
Not very corporate either

46
00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:58.100
I am not familiar with many businesses

47
00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:59.220
You let him be kind

48
00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:01.560
Get to know me for a while first

49
00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:06.580
Believe me where Si Han is, I am Si Han

50
00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:08.960
There is also a request

51
00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:11.440
before you go to school

52
00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:16.650
You have to get married first, will you pay it back?

53
00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:19.390
A good girl with a clean net worth

54
00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:21.570
They all accepted it coldly

55
00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.730
Are you also in the birthplace?

56
00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.250
It's not as good as one day at a time.

57
00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:30.630
I feel like I was in my childbearing years

58
00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.250
Help me from sunda

59
00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.200
I call you all my good friends, brothers.

60
00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:37.400
A taste is a good project with a high degree of education

61
00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:39.580
Completely dead, the top of us, the bottom of us, dead and harmed, but not

62
00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:41.530
Let death harm your whole body, right?

63
00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:42.970
do you think

64
00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:43.620
No need

65
00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:45.980
I already have a suspicious daughter

66
00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.910
Time has passed

67
00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:49.040
I'll bring her over to see
