00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:03.980
I would like to invite everyone to have afternoon tea, please order whatever you want.

2
00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:06.620
Wanwan, I am very happy for you when you clean up the building.

3
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.140
She is the one you invited to dinner yesterday and is already half-dressed.

4
00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:10.540
How do you treat everyone to afternoon tea?

5
00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:13.160
What did you say? I didn't.

6
00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:16.700
Look inside for yourself. At the same time, this family said what kind of tyrant you are looking at.

7
00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:19.460
It was Bai who had thirty or forty people. Now three or four hundred people dug out.

8
00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:21.420
You can't. I'm explaining.

9
00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:24.940
What are you doing? The director has already listened to what you said.

10
00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:26.660
Why don't you listen now and eat?

11
00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:30.490
What's going on inside him?

12
00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:31.790
Forget it this time

13
00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:33.210
There's no need for you to use what's on display

14
00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.050
You will go up and end up with four consequences

15
00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:37.130
Why does he always listen to you?

16
00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:46.400
It’s better if he doesn’t do this next time, good director.

17
00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:50.060
I heard you don’t use my name again in the future.

18
00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:51.180
After all, I am the one paying the bill.

19
00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:52.990
Didn't you say you wanted to invite everyone together?

20
00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:54.780
I already invited you yesterday

21
00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.060
It cost 10,000 yuan

22
00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:58.080
I have a lot

23
00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:59.180
Go to what I know

24
00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:00.900
Are you thinking, please give me my light number?

25
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.200
That's what I got from my own hard work.

26
00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.879
How I spend it is my own business

27
00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:07.920
But if I hadn't heard something

28
00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:13.480
It's better if you use a spear to rise up, your reality

29
00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:16.040
Since you want to say that I just had dinner

30
00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:17.240
Didn't you say what you just said?

31
00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:18.980
I always invite everyone to come together

32
00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:20.780
You know I'm satisfied

33
00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:22.980
What do you mean is very simple

34
00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.370
How about the meal I just had with you?

35
00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:30.240
Neither of these suggestions are good. Cut them out.

36
00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.120
I won't buy anything from you again

37
00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:34.100
Please take care of yourself

38
00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.000
It seems that this back looks lighter than Tang Xiong’s photo

39
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.200
When I go to court, I want to see how long you can survive.
