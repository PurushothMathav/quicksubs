00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.020
Needless to say, you were too impulsive just now.

2
00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:04.560
What about those legitimate births that cost 30,000 yuan?

3
00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:06.840
Did you know that symbiosis will not last long?

4
00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:08.990
Three, five, five, five

5
00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:12.230
You should have told me earlier that you were from Guanshan

6
00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:13.530
I gave it to you a long time ago

7
00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:14.730
You don’t have to say you’re angry today

8
00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:18.290
I know you are thinking of me to vent your anger

9
00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:21.360
But we are already married

10
00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:22.500
The water is a bit slippery

11
00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.750
You have to be patient when you should be patient

12
00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:28.150
Why will we have more places to spend money in the future?

13
00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:29.800
This girl is not only kind

14
00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.340
Time is so expensive

15
00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:33.380
If a person is angry, this child will die.

16
00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.020
I haven’t gotten it yet at home.

17
00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.280
Wait until you get it

18
00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.800
There are other uses

19
00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.460
I don't think I can spend any money on how to help me get a ride.

20
00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:44.170
Hand in hand

21
00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:47.350
Aren’t you the daughter of the Tang family?

22
00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:51.430
What do you think of your money-spending mother?

23
00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:53.070
You just need to pick up someone

24
00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.090
The flame inside Yaya’s house

25
00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:57.720
I'll give you three hundred thousand like this

26
00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:59.560
You give me my money

27
00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:01.680
Give it to your mother

28
00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:04.959
can you

29
00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:13.560
I'll give you that Mr. Yu

30
00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:15.720
Your private flight to talk tomorrow

31
00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:16.720
But no one tells lies

32
00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.730
Just go back and make up for it now

33
00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:20.300
This person you see

34
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:24.380
There should be nothing to lose, so keep checking.

35
00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:25.380
By the way, Mr. Li

36
00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:26.930
The girl who saved you

37
00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:28.940
Now that you know who she is

38
00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:30.130
Then there is no need to appear

39
00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:32.570
I'm going to prepare to divide the ranger. It's hard to thank her, my daughter.

40
00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:34.700
you know me

41
00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:36.910
you don't know me

42
00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:39.900
my benefactor

43
00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:42.080
If you want to thank me, I will do it myself.
