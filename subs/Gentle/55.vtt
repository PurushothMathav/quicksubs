00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.820
This is back,

2
00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:10.620
Okay, don’t leave when you come back this time,

3
00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.320
One look at the number one in your second book family,

4
00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:16.000
Originally everything was fine,

5
00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:19.020
When I take it with me in Jiangcheng, I have to apply for something.

6
00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.270
I really thought about it and let people beat me,

7
00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:24.110
Fractures all over the body have not been found yet.

8
00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:25.830
Who are the brothers? Really,

9
00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:28.130
Let’s lose all our reputation as a traitor to this,

10
00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:30.810
Also, when I come back this time,

11
00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.890
Just to tell you this,

12
00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:38.100
Why, you found out who the brothers are for them, didn’t you?

13
00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:42.530
I'm the one who's going to beat the good guys, right?

14
00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:44.020
I'm always in body

15
00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:45.800
The things I'm teaching and inspecting are almost at a low speed.

16
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.160
So I can’t do it for the time being.

17
00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.480
Why are good people beaten like that?

18
00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:53.220
That's because he himself is self-cold.

19
00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:56.450
After all, you are all my grandchildren

20
00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:58.010
This song is precious

21
00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:59.970
It's not meat

22
00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:02.990
Even if my wife is usually stubborn

23
00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:05.390
You can't beat people like that either.

24
00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:07.930
Knockout is your brother

25
00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:11.370
Just one breath away, my life is just for it

26
00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:13.590
This attack is too harsh, right?

27
00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.170
You beat people like this

28
00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:17.310
As for the second uncle, it fits the bill.

29
00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.370
It's my grandpa

30
00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:19.610
It also fits the ground

31
00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:21.310
You reversed our age

32
00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.960
Produces friction on the ground

33
00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:25.080
Sorry grandpa

34
00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.820
I didn't think it was the right time to tell you

35
00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:29.280
But you actually pointed it out

36
00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.580
I also gave him a straight meal

37
00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:32.860
My previous flight was actually not a bowl.

38
00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:34.400
I already have some political situations

39
00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:38.280
All the evidence was only given to the second uncle. He paid two people.

40
00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.820
I'm doing survival research

41
00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:41.700
Not just my accounting facts

42
00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.270
And my parents were in a car accident before

43
00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:45.390
so called accident

44
00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.570
Do you know what it means, child?

45
00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.450
Don't hesitate

46
00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.650
When my father was in the abolished court committee and established the family as an adult,

47
00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:55.830
He and my mother were immediately involved in a car accident

48
00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:59.550
And it was also when I abolished the court committee and established a family record as an adult

49
00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:00.610
What a coincidence

50
00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.860
Don't forget to remember that there was an accident.

51
00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:05.720
Do you really think this is a coincidence or do you mean

52
00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:06.960
you always remember

53
00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.199
he is your son

54
00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:10.800
So I don’t want to apply

55
00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:18.170
How come you look so much like Grandpa Li? Grandpa

56
00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:20.160
It doesn’t matter what I think if you don’t pay me back.

57
00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:21.560
The evidence in my hand

58
00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.480
All this will be proven soon

59
00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:24.890
I keep everything in

60
00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:26.090
Not well protected from the wind

61
00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:27.410
now i grow up

62
00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:30.210
It's safe for him to start immediately

63
00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:31.590
Touch to respond

64
00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.970
I will never dare to bend

65
00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:35.670
As for sweating, I’m not sure.

66
00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:37.830
It’s my Grandpa Li’s thing
