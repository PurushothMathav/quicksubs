00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.500
My Miss Tang went out to prepare a special program for you,

2
00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:09.390
You must not miss it. Miss Tang is not going to the bathroom.

3
00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:14.280
It seems that Mr. Bai is still very concerned about our Miss Tang.

4
00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.300
Then this month ago,

5
00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:19.770
Forget it early, go safely, come,

6
00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.860
Come, come, come, like this,

7
00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.040
What is this, Mr. Bai,

8
00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.660
Isn’t it already here? Come on, I’ll open the door for you.

9
00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:29.420
I'll let you do some walking around early,

10
00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:31.920
This is a gift prepared by our company and the little Tang sisters.

11
00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:32.980
What will happen to you in the future?

12
00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:33.900
Just thinking it doesn't matter

13
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:34.380
I don't want to be tired

14
00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:35.020
Don't be urgent

15
00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:36.240
It’s easy to say goodbye

16
00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:54.350
So obedient

17
00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:05.960
They all spread him out and killed me.

18
00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.340
This is spicy and will make you full

19
00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:08.320
This is something Wu La will do

20
00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:10.220
You are the sister of Wu Lahui

21
00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.910
I'll let you go and you'll never remember what you've eaten.

22
00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:15.300
You got this result

23
00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:16.840
You are so spicy

24
00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:20.970
Run him down here

25
00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:21.450
this is really

26
00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:21.930
Meet with Wu La

27
00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:22.890
I'm really not a bad person

28
00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:23.790
He is actually

29
00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:27.610
Then you go, I go, okay, I let you go

30
00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:28.210
Please come here

31
00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:39.420
I'm too small to open the door for you, sister, you're looking for death
