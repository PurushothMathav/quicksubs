00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:03.440
Miss, can we still use this level?

2
00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:06.280
You have to ask yourself, what does yours look like?

3
00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:08.660
If this has been washed, it is guaranteed to be clean.

4
00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.500
I have also dealt with that kind of problem,

5
00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:13.480
Just remembering this is enough to give you one day,

6
00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:15.530
You take us away,

7
00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:18.230
What I do is for your wedding,

8
00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:20.350
I'll let you take it, so that's it, right?

9
00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:23.130
Come on, it will rain heavily on your wedding day

10
00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:24.760
The road is full of uses

11
00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:26.440
Continue reading once a week

12
00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:27.580
Don't take it easy

13
00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:28.520
Don't be so dirty

14
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.160
Because my legs are broken

15
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.659
And start the pot

16
00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:33.540
you need to know

17
00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:34.580
We don't have this kind of marriage

18
00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:36.240
I've always been given dry cleaning

19
00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:38.660
Do you know what dry cleaning means?

20
00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:40.080
I am eclectic and I am clicking

21
00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.160
How can we sell our marriage?

22
00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:43.960
I still agreed to this sequel

23
00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:45.380
I am you

24
00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:46.640
You can't even afford a marriage like this

25
00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.900
Just don’t get married

26
00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:49.740
Who says not to buy it?

27
00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:50.860
I haven’t bought the wedding yet.

28
00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.120
Which law stipulates that

29
00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.140
The marriage murder written by you Yongye range

30
00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.420
Rent to make big profits for yourself

31
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:01.380
It’s just you who are young and you are here

32
00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.970
Your wedding settlement is of average quality.

33
00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:06.820
So there is no need to buy and kill

34
00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:08.020
I can’t buy a few, but I won’t write about it.

35
00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:09.660
Why are you talking about these useless things?

36
00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:10.640
Who said buying and writing

37
00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:12.770
Maybe you have water ash

38
00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:14.390
I can't forget that they are all high-end models.

39
00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:15.890
Did you dance at that time?

40
00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:21.500
Don't read it or write it down

41
00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.450
As long as we meet

42
00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.340
I really feel loved for you

43
00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.020
You said you look good to Niantian

44
00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:28.990
Why did you find one so small?

45
00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:31.530
Besides, the double days are really long

46
00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.540
I'm blinded by your words.

47
00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.780
Mr. Guo Laogong went to Longdao and a few outsiders talked too much.

48
00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:40.640
No, I should like what I sent back to you now.

49
00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.920
You must be so grateful for what you did to my old palace just now.

50
00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:44.150
No need until now

51
00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:53.770
You ladies like these.
