00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.210
Master, you said that our company does not treat villains,

2
00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:06.000
But that Chen Jingyang who is surrounded by thousands of people,

3
00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:08.080
He was frightened and let go within two days.

4
00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:10.960
Then the new director came and summarized it well,

5
00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.000
I deliberately asked you to treat me to a guest,

6
00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:15.010
As a result, he got out of the car and passed by,

7
00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:17.690
Sutra wishes. You said you are quite magical,

8
00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.710
I don’t know, I thought some grown-up was behind you.

9
00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.750
Summary of the head, after leaving the car,

10
00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.670
Yes, yes, you didn't come yesterday,

11
00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:28.370
What Mr. Sun said, this summary is accepted.

12
00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:30.710
It should be faster, yes,

13
00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:33.470
Gu Yan really solved it

14
00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.290
Situational Kanglu Fenduyin

15
00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:36.730
Can it really be solved?

16
00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:40.120
But what did Gu Yan hide from me?

17
00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:41.960
The running director didn’t pursue it.

18
00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:43.340
He is in vain

19
00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:45.040
Have you met anyone interesting recently?

20
00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:45.680
I am an adult

21
00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:49.410
Otherwise, how can you do it without making it difficult for your people?

22
00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:52.490
How can I take the exam? I do it every day

23
00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:53.930
except with you

24
00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.240
Just be with me, Lao Hong, unless

25
00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:59.500
You are the one I will

26
00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.420
It's your husband

27
00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:09.900
I mean, I heard it

28
00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.060
Let’s talk about this

29
00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:14.960
You said your husband is, after all,

30
00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:16.760
people who passed away and made mistakes

31
00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:18.160
But what does he use me for?

32
00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:19.340
If you don't take me with you, take me with you

33
00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:20.780
I will tell you later

34
00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:27.820
My husband is not like this

35
00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:29.300
You can't do jail time because of her

36
00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:32.070
This is biased against her. It’s the background.

37
00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.930
Is it right to make it?

38
00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.590
I told you not to be angry

39
00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:39.090
How do you know that I talk to you as if you are my rule?

40
00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:42.560
It's not true, I'm assuming

41
00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.760
What is a monorail?

42
00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.960
Object of your kindness

43
00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:51.190
You don't have to say it

44
00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:52.940
I know how to call myself father-in-law

45
00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:54.940
Okay, I won't say anything anymore

46
00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:57.980
Look, look, look, look, look

47
00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:58.780
There's quite a bit left
