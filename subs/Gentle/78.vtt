00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.060
I heard that you gave Bai Shi a cooperation project and said that you were a loser for Bai Shi.

2
00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:14.610
She recently has a project that she wants to give to that white chicken and fish. I will help my dad.

3
00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:20.720
Of course, Dad didn’t want to take care of me. She and I didn’t mean what she said about herself.

4
00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.720
Well, I'm very good at my current job. It's impossible to do this.

5
00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.640
In this way, this horse is either jumping the grass or returning to wait until dad gets old.

6
00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.220
You can't figure out the company yet.

7
00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:35.420
The big company is mine

8
00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:37.140
Didn’t you promise me a long time ago?

9
00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.200
What can you use if the front reducer doesn't fly?

10
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:40.540
Then you have your help

11
00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:43.460
Wouldn't that look better?

12
00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:44.360
That's right

13
00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.440
That's not the way to get a man.

14
00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.080
Still pretty awesome

15
00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:51.370
You are right, but I often play

16
00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.970
Always prepared for the weather

17
00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:55.070
Are you getting married?

18
00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:56.390
play outside

19
00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:57.970
Still have to be careful

20
00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:00.540
Where can you fix that chicken and duck meal at your house?

21
00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:01.720
You want the last measure

22
00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:02.700
It was him who harmed

23
00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.800
What are you talking about? I'll start with

24
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.960
My princess relies on ability

25
00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.080
Which shore roads are not open to me?

26
00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:13.600
In fact, I have an emotional relationship with Marriage Bizi.

27
00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:15.580
sad things often

28
00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:17.040
Don't want to look at me and say

29
00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.600
What is going on

30
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.780
I think He Yao can't deal with emotions

31
00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:21.700
unwilling to feel

32
00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:25.720
You can eat, but I didn’t think of Tang Wa

33
00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.060
If I want to know something about it

34
00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:29.140
Follow me upstairs

35
00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:30.100
We slowly
