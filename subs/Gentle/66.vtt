00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:08.189
Let me ask, ask, ask, ask, ask, ask, ask, ask, ask, ask, ask, ask, ask, ask, ask, ask, ask, ask.

2
00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:13.490
Ask, ask, ask, ask, ask, ask, ask, ask, ask, ask, ask, ask, ask, ask, ask, ask, ask, ask, ask, ask, ask, ask.

3
00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:15.010
Ask, ask, ask, ask, ask, ask, ask, ask, ask, ask, ask, ask, ask, ask, ask, ask, ask, ask, ask, ask, ask, ask, ask, ask, ask, ask, ask.

4
00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:18.850
Ask Ask Ask Ask Ask Ask Ask Ask Ask Ask Ask Ask Ask Ask Ask Ask Ask Ask Ask Ask Ask Ask Ask Ask Ask Ask Ask Ask Ask Ask Ask Ask Ask Ask Ask Ask Ask Ask Ask Ask Ask Ask Ask Ask Ask Ask Ask Ask Ask Ask Ask Ask Ask Ask Ask Ask Ask Ask Ask Ask Ask Ask Ask Ask.

5
00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:20.750
Ask, ask, ask, ask, ask, ask, ask, ask, ask, ask, ask, ask, ask, ask, ask, ask, ask, ask, ask, ask, ask, ask.

6
00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:30.680
Ask Ask Ask Ask Ask Ask Ask Ask Ask Ask Ask Ask Ask Ask Ask Ask Ask Ask Ask Ask Ask Ask Ask Ask Ask Ask Ask Ask Ask Ask Ask Ask Ask Ask Ask Ask Ask Ask Ask Ask Ask Ask Ask Ask Ask Ask Ask Ask Ask Ask Ask Ask Ask Ask Ask Ask Ask Ask Ask Ask Ask Ask Ask Ask Ask Ask Ask. ask

7
00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:31.780
He rubbed it, right?

8
00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.150
I have never had such a woman

9
00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:36.150
Let's study after get off work

10
00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:39.910
In fact, several people

11
00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:41.450
Well, that's just for talking to the outside world.

12
00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:42.890
I am the book around me now

13
00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:44.930
There was air given to personnel

14
00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:47.240
How could I do that

15
00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.560
How could this happen?

16
00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:53.040
Who do you think made him look like that?

17
00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:54.140
This is obviously coming back

18
00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:55.000
The rhythm he wants

19
00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:58.250
I saw that student studying last night

20
00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:03.300
It's just you and me talking

21
00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:04.810
He came up and wanted to

22
00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:06.370
He's a senior staff member. You go and follow the staff back.

23
00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.190
I just feel that it is impossible for your family to take into account their age.

24
00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:11.350
Kunyan would never do such a thing

25
00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:14.590
I know you too, don't take it to heart

26
00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:16.010
You also knew him and tried him

27
00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:19.650
But he's not performing, right?

28
00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.950
I was also tried by him

29
00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:23.590
You have said things personally

30
00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:27.060
Then he didn't have a chance to feel it? He turned around?

31
00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:30.320
Are you going to always be labeled as the most half, right?

32
00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:34.020
Vacations never go away

33
00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.420
If you really treat me as a friend

34
00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:40.640
Just please stop taking care of me, okay?

35
00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:41.900
I was wrong

36
00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:50.830
Otherwise, the girl is really behind me

37
00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:53.810
why she story goes with saying she finally girl

38
00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:55.640
Her story follows disbelief

39
00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:56.900
I'm going to find a girl

40
00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:58.020
Play with mood

41
00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:59.790
What is going on?
