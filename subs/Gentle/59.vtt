00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:19.520
Are you finally awake?

2
00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.430
Why did you do that?

3
00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:24.070
What should I do?

4
00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:28.620
I also know that I feel emotionally unstable when I wake up.

5
00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:33.180
I also know that the place is uncomfortable, you know?

6
00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:37.240
So it's almost time again and you finally wake up,

7
00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:49.030
You just have enough to let me down.

8
00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:51.930
Why do you get up and talk about your evil boyfriend?

9
00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.200
He told me everything about Tan evil, and even showed me his marriage to that man,

10
00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:01.680
Why do you want to get up?

11
00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.340
A person, you let the great evil,

12
00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.160
I want you to talk about evil and get to know it.

13
00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:12.140
Others taught me. Others taught me.
