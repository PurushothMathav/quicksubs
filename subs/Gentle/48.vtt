00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:06.470
If many people could contact me, I would not only support them.

2
00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.340
I know salt,

3
00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:17.150
Come on, husband, why did you suddenly transfer money to me?

4
00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:18.510
Where can I get so much money?

5
00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:22.130
The basic time limit is completely predictable, and the game on the excavator cannot be transferred.

6
00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:25.670
I can't take your money, I'm not risking the big game like you are.

7
00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:28.750
If you don't know your husband, you will be very powerful if you want a husband.

8
00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:30.690
I won't let myself get hurt.

9
00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:32.470
Then I still can't ask for your money,

10
00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:35.010
I have money of my own, so I can finish it,

11
00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:38.620
I shouldn't give you that kind of blood. Have fun

12
00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:39.560
I am your photo

13
00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.060
Everything you do is fixed

14
00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:45.610
I won't let you drive anywhere, no no.

15
00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:47.460
Go to work well

16
00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.580
You are our current mistress

17
00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:52.280
My reward heart was originally meant to be handed over to you

18
00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:53.620
Just be casual

19
00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:55.080
I only have one caregiver

20
00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:57.300
That is, don't let anyone take your car.

21
00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:03.500
I understand. Thank you.

22
00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:09.810
I'm actually really sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry

23
00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.850
But the winner is the one in the middle

24
00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.250
If there is such a crime

25
00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:15.010
It will solve the problem of bidding

26
00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:16.120
Can't say it just
