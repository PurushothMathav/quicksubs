00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:04.190
That's China,

2
00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:07.830
Let's all go shopping. You have to go to work when you are a student.

3
00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.130
Buy each other what you can easily.

4
00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:50.300
I don’t have to use it. I really use the full machine coach to face the three kings.

5
00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:53.640
Third is it? Yes

6
00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:55.940
My female student

7
00:00:58.570 --> 00:00:59.510
It’s good in your heart not to hurt you

8
00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:00.550
I listen to you

9
00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:08.540
I really don’t let others spread the word.

10
00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:09.980
Have you taught me a lesson?

11
00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:23.560
I also have to put on some clothes. Please help me as I command.

12
00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:26.240
Wash your hands looks good for you to eat.

13
00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:53.640
All butt shoulder clothes

14
00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:54.640
Than filigree on us

15
00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:56.970
Especially the kind that have several common ones.

16
00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.010
Hurry up with these few pictures

17
00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:03.430
The first item is the first item

18
00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:05.270
Forget it

19
00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:07.090
There is nothing that Tianchang cannot penetrate.

20
00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:08.460
How come there is a chance

21
00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:10.180
It is suitable for wearing formal makeup

22
00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.280
Now forget it, what is heaven? Yes, it seems so coincidental.

23
00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:21.140
The most beautiful thing at work is home

24
00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:22.740
But this kind of recovery

25
00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:24.340
What kind of clothes are you talking about?

26
00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.670
Please tell me which ward you can change from

27
00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.220
What is the solution?

28
00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.500
Ask your father to pay for you and your mother.

29
00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.160
You ask, you are causing so much trouble to our house

30
00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:34.340
Two meals and five buckets? What?

31
00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.300
Yue Tu Most Wishes Network is quite reasonable.

32
00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:37.860
Not only did he change it and wear it,

33
00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:39.580
I also paid fees for the next two years.

34
00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:41.540
Yuefu Xingan please Yue

35
00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:45.320
When did people pay five tips for food and conversation?

36
00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:48.260
Isn’t that the same fee?

37
00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:49.530
Just go to our neighborhood and do good deeds

38
00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:50.630
Beat him up

39
00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:52.490
Do good deeds and still pay debts

40
00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:54.170
I think Yue Fu is the dearest

41
00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:55.670
I won't say any more

42
00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:58.460
Let's go, let's go, let's stand

43
00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:00.010
I mean yes

44
00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.440
Because I'm discussing a project with your company

45
00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:03.880
This month your company would like to meet

46
00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:04.920
I will participate

47
00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.160
Guaranteed meeting

48
00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:07.120
Don’t do it alone

49
00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.960
I signed autographs and composed poems at the company

50
00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:09.660
What's the point?

51
00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:12.110
Then take your husband with you.

52
00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:13.910
If you want our colleagues to go too far, look at it.

53
00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:15.270
What's so good about someone else?

54
00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:18.110
From Tiannan’s Dangbao, you are now

55
00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:19.950
You wouldn't dare to take out the money, right?

56
00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:21.690
My wife is doing very well

57
00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:23.240
Is there anything I don’t dare to bring?

58
00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:24.220
I'll see you then
