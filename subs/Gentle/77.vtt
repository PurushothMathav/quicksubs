00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.220
Gu Yan has already gone to Zhangsheng Santiao,

2
00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:04.880
Even when I call him, he always gets a bad call.

3
00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:08.430
The information is returned simply. I don’t know what you are doing.

4
00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:10.920
Why couldn't he tell me anything.

5
00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:21.700
Oh, my king,

6
00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:25.430
Go home for dinner in the evening. Dad can help you if you have something to do.

7
00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.670
If anything happens, I can tell you over the phone.

8
00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:30.980
Oops, why are you so cold-hearted?

9
00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:33.080
You solved such a big problem,

10
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.700
You also come back to see him.

11
00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.760
His current experience of love is not very good,

12
00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.960
You'd better come back and stop fighting,

13
00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:40.080
What's the final analysis?

14
00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.440
You are sisters now

15
00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.320
Tang Jiaguan and I only have lost memories

16
00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:45.300
As for why

17
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.700
I came up because I knew it in my heart

18
00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:51.270
Why do you need to come over now?

19
00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:58.290
Why do you talk to dad so much? Okay, okay, okay?

20
00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:59.810
Even if you don’t recognize Tang Jiaren

21
00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:02.720
But something happened to Tang You this time

22
00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:04.239
I heard that it was given to a consultant

23
00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:06.960
There are some relationships, why don't you clarify them?

24
00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:09.090
It has nothing to do with him. Stop talking nonsense.

25
00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.450
Although we talked about not having a good relationship with me

26
00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:12.670
but these things

27
00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:14.030
Find someone to surround you with

28
00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:15.540
I want to go back and see you

29
00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:18.380
Just listen to what he says

30
00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:22.800
I'll come back tonight, okay, okay

31
00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.480
Bring your husband back with you

32
00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:27.880
He'll do it next time, okay?

33
00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:29.140
See you that night

34
00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:32.180
Malaysians are all earthly people.

35
00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:34.240
And you have no family affection at all

36
00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:36.360
Call me back tonight

37
00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.600
You definitely don’t want to trade with me and Tan Yao

38
00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.160
The so-called sisterhood is so simple
