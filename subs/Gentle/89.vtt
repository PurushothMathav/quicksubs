00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:03.860
Light, don’t let the memory be under pressure,

2
00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:06.090
It's still very rich compared to this.

3
00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:09.600
Look, there must be no director. I know you let my princess do the double act.

4
00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.970
But now life is very sold out,

5
00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.410
Don't leave either. Deal with others on your own.

6
00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:17.320
You call me brother is the best,

7
00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.160
My brothers are very fierce, which makes our family miserable.

8
00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.590
My mother lived a good life and gave it to others to drink for ten days.

9
00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.320
It's all important. Among the several people, they make rice paste by themselves and others,

10
00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:35.390
If you talk about it next time, you will really get angry.

11
00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.530
Okay, I won’t say it either.

12
00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:41.980
When you forget, I am the same,

13
00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:44.070
if tell the truth

14
00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:45.530
Still thinking about yellow?

15
00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:51.560
The truth is how to be superior and comfortable

16
00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:53.670
I'm asking if you want to say something to your superiors

17
00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:54.850
The position has passed

18
00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:57.210
I know what method is the longest

19
00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:59.620
In the end, it may not be possible to realize it and then not

20
00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:00.800
Gotta get better

21
00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.020
disappear together

22
00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:02.900
And before they

23
00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:04.260
Find those experts from abroad

24
00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:05.580
Don't disappear half as much

25
00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:06.460
Only then can you bring scriptures

26
00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:07.860
They are not necessarily very close

27
00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.020
I really have to do with my cell phone

28
00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.400
Look at me tired

29
00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.460
These don’t have to be sentimental
