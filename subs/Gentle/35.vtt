00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:05.710
Wife, you said you married me because you were so smart, beautiful and capable.

2
00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:09.640
You are scolded every day. What are you saying here?

3
00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:12.850
Everyone in heaven can see that I am not in a good marriage.

4
00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:15.390
Still so noisy

5
00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:17.690
Then don’t I have no confidence?

6
00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:21.610
You see, after all, your sister's goal is to marry history.

7
00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:24.940
And you, why are you so difficult?

8
00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:28.720
Then don't let you go. I heard the real name

9
00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:30.220
But they are all against Zhang Jian

10
00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:36.590
Tell me again. It turns out there are still problems with this history. What do you think?

11
00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:40.190
The outside world has never seen a single photo of her and

12
00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:42.270
You want to talk about taking photos with her

13
00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.490
They can only have such a small side profile

14
00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:45.950
Make it so mysterious

15
00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:48.190
But don’t continue to get up and recite

16
00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:50.430
I think it's a person

17
00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:55.040
Do you want to be fucked dirty before you get old?

18
00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:57.760
Like the children of a big family in history

19
00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:59.340
Dali from childhood

20
00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.260
So the weight of history is like

21
00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:03.400
Take it off early

22
00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:04.580
And that kind of consciousness

23
00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:06.320
Not afraid of being naked again

24
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.100
I still have some Xinyi pounding now.

25
00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.100
It’s best to steam it

26
00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:13.040
This hit

27
00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:14.360
Quite what time

28
00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:18.580
Are you right? United States United States

29
00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:21.440
We still went home to America

30
00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.300
You said you were in Jiangcheng Palace

31
00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:25.020
So do you mean this?

32
00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:25.580
Is he

33
00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:26.560
Looks like a painstaking study

34
00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:28.470
Afraid and exposed to the United States

35
00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:29.770
Do you dare to do the work? Can you beat me?

36
00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:31.830
Don't choose this one

37
00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:33.210
Break me for you

38
00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:39.840
We are not talking and we are not providing
