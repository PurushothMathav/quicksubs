00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.880
Everyone, thanks to my hard work, the company won the title in July.

2
00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.520
Here today, I have the hard work to promote a few relatives,

3
00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:10.870
They are also very capable and don’t want to jump,

4
00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:13.050
Bringing such a big deal to the company,

5
00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.700
Company father, Lao An,

6
00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:20.700
Early in the morning, Lao An came,

7
00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:23.390
Bai Shaoqian, whatever plan you make,

8
00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:25.510
Take this area for our company,

9
00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.280
I still want Ma Gong to be old,

10
00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:28.800
Again I round my bones,

11
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.340
How many houses can Lao An apply for?

12
00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:31.900
Above is the main palace, Yuan Palace.

13
00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:36.680
Company price line, connected, counter-prepared,

14
00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.840
Three early three early three early three early three early three early three early three early three early three early three early three early three early three early three early three early three early three early three early three early three early three early three mornings three mornings three mornings three mornings three mornings three mornings three mornings

15
00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.700
You mean my future son-in-law is six thousand?

16
00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.800
Isn’t it true that the first month of the year is 120,000 yuan?

17
00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.900
For a sweetheart like you

18
00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:46.680
All have such a good start

19
00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:48.740
It’s good to hate together, Mr. Sun

20
00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.400
I should ask more questions

21
00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:54.340
It seems that you and the former sales director didn't agree with each other before.

22
00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:56.040
What you promised me back then

23
00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.420
As long as I win the PepsiCo project

24
00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:59.900
Young master found 20,000

25
00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:01.460
Just to live beyond the subjective level

26
00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:04.860
It seems that he has also come in and out of you. He is finished.

27
00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:06.500
A new guy last night

28
00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.420
To have such a mind to wait for

29
00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:09.700
Are you still not satisfied?

30
00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:12.880
And he won the list of the Bai period

31
00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:14.560
It's not the work of one person, is it?

32
00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:15.760
You want it right now

33
00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:17.340
Where do you think Chen Jingyang is?

34
00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.680
You made everyone think so

35
00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:19.580
You make me less able to serve you

36
00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:20.120
unimportant things

37
00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:21.580
young people doing sex

38
00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:22.980
Or it would be a big drama

39
00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:25.840
Otherwise, the company would be concerned

40
00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.860
But it’s definitely not the case that the prince is dead, brother

41
00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:29.860
This sales director position

42
00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:31.400
I already have someone chosen

43
00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:32.640
It's your illegitimate daughter

44
00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:34.530
Is Mo Chenzheng right?

45
00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:36.460
Of course not

46
00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:44.900
He is. Hello everyone.

47
00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:48.130
I am the sales director of Xinri. Fortunately

48
00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:50.810
Bring me a good guy called Mr. Sun

49
00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:53.730
Did you hear the conversation you just had with this employee?

50
00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:56.230
Projects before the day, my previous class

51
00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:00.200
I think this is indeed the work this worker put in.

52
00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.720
The salary will increase to 20,000

53
00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:03.460
As for knowing how to do it?

54
00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:05.040
Hosted by

55
00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:05.980
he's in my place

56
00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:07.300
Then what should I do?

57
00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:13.240
That's good

58
00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:14.900
We're done

59
00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:17.360
Good but way out

60
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.960
Is this okay?
