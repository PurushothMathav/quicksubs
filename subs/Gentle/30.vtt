1
00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:08.320
Actually I'm not.

2
00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:10.230
Take over, if you have nothing to do, let the team go to work.

3
00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:11.740
I'll finish cooking the noodles for you.

4
00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:25.420
People who stand tall are often eating.

5
00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:28.320
Someone has been sent here. He found out my birth ID.

6
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:28.880
Not yet.

7
00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:33.080
But I am facing breakfast. I'm worried about being able to eat.

8
00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:35.560
If you don’t fight, I suggest you,

9
00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:37.990
But you start eating, don't eat early.

10
00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:39.640
I force you to wake up and eat breakfast without breakfast.

11
00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:43.170
When will it be your turn to take care of my business?

12
00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:45.040
sorry.

13
00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.200
Send someone to protect me and not let anyone from Li Changhe come near.

14
00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.120
What trouble does Fuguo have?

15
00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:52.120
Will not spare anyone

16
00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:52.840
Please come to the president

17
00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:54.000
I can't guide myself

18
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.800
The blessings of the country are endless

19
00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:56.600
You seem to be

20
00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.900
Don't let them know you're promoting me

21
00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.930
Is this the most popular one with many kingdoms? I think

22
00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:02.780
Everyone will be in front now

23
00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:03.580
That's it

24
00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:04.239
Or the beginning

25
00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:17.570
Didn't you tell me something just now?

26
00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:18.960
I forgot now

27
00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:19.720
don't let them here

28
00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:21.280
They don’t even advertise that I’m going there

29
00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.700
Is this the most popular one with many kingdoms?

30
00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:24.640
What job do I want to find?

31
00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:25.990
so suddenly

32
00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:27.390
For example, you are

33
00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:29.710
It doesn't matter if you go prepared

34
00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:31.150
I can keep it

35
00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:32.150
Men and women alike

36
00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:32.950
man's truth

37
00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.350
Then am I not a noob for dinner?

38
00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:37.770
What are your thoughts?

39
00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:39.840
Times are different now

40
00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:42.800
You're not just here to pick up the male lead and lead the female lead inside.

41
00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.120
Didn't you take good care of me?

42
00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:46.110
I can't mention it

43
00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.390
There are so many calculations

44
00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:49.400
You seem to get along well

45
00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.100
What nonsense are you talking about?

46
00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:52.840
You are ready to support me

47
00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:57.670
Then I can make you drink until you feel comfortable and make you roll your eyes.

48
00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:59.530
Then you can't just eat rice.

49
00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:04.630
You have to work hard, just say oh well.

50
00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:06.070
It's up to you

51
00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:07.130
Do you want this job?

52
00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:08.449
Just work

53
00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:09.780
Don't call me

54
00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:11.600
I'm about to eat my head of white flour.

55
00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:16.900
Can't think of anything else to eat
