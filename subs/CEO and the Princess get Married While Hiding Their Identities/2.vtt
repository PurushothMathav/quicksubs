1
00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:07.850
Is it limited to us?

2
00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:10.190
I only have two pairs of black cards in the country.

3
00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:13.280
One on top of me, that one,

4
00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:15.580
Go and say that it is in the hands of the trustworthy Zhang Men.

5
00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:21.280
Yes. Could it be that you were responsible for that letter?

6
00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:22.880
How is that possible?

7
00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:24.900
Am I going to disappear as a fat man weighing over 200 pounds?

8
00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:28.680
But you, too, are faithful,

9
00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:34.380
Aren't you the blind date I want to protect you from?

10
00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:36.150
What's going on with Su Po?

11
00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:41.360
Don't call me "Beibei" again

12
00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:42.380
You're pretending like this

13
00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.770
I told you that this is so good for me

14
00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:54.390
Will I come or not?

15
00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.750
I said I didnâ€™t mention coming to you

16
00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:10.810
So they all have properties

17
00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.240
One is an aircraft

18
00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.420
What is the progress of the family?

19
00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:15.040
One is its place

20
00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:16.380
Comparative airliner

21
00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:17.700
Comparative aviation vehicle, you are like this

22
00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:19.770
Which one should be kept secret from moving forward?

23
00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:22.160
You'll get up, right?

24
00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:23.830
She said she was working

25
00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:24.830
Go and investigate

26
00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:26.050
Which vice-successful company did he work with?

27
00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:29.130
Vice President, Hang Cheng, also want to ask which vice-general?

28
00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:38.680
Call the home country number. Today I called our company market.
