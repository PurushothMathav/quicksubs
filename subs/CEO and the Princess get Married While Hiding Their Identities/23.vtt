00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.350
You borrow Mr. Guo.

2
00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:06.430
Who would say these things are more important now?

3
00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:12.850
Who is mom? This is you. Listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen.

4
00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:15.870
Listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen

5
00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:20.970
Listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen

6
00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.550
Listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen

7
00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:24.230
Listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen

8
00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:32.200
Listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen listen

9
00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:38.900
How could the vice president value such a poor mystery?

10
00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.970
You are so awesome now

11
00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:42.250
The god over there is this kind of kid

12
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:43.280
Really over there

13
00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:45.200
He is completely satisfied

14
00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:48.360
What am I bringing here today?

15
00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:50.520
Louwa's son

16
00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:53.580
Then chasing so many daughters is

17
00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:56.830
You can give it to me as you wish, young master

18
00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:58.510
How do you get the guarantee?

19
00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:00.770
Let's keep a gentleman together

20
00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:02.290
Otherwise, when you Gao Taihui

21
00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:04.610
Isn’t it our son’s fault?

22
00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:05.710
If you are from Tianlou

23
00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:08.410
Why not? Why is he such a person? Lou Hua?

24
00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:10.910
If these two people continue to stay here

25
00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:12.960
How do you think about our process?

26
00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.560
Then you will be the one to come during our process.

27
00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:20.300
He didn't tell you anything

28
00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:22.600
If our equipment improves

29
00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:25.250
It’s not just a few habits, it’s not that the equipment is in good condition.

30
00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:27.780
I said it all

31
00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:28.420
You two may ask

32
00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:29.690
You go and make a video call

33
00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:32.310
Five more o'clock

34
00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:34.310
The sound lets you solve it a little bit
