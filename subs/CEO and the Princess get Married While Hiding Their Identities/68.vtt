I've been waiting for my son's good fortune recently.

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:08.320
Father-in-law. Your son and I are quite familiar.

3
00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:12.540
Oops, stop pretending.

4
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.110
I know it all. My son is a big person on the outside.

5
00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.800
In fact, he has always been attracted to you.

6
00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:21.850
It may not be good to spend that day in the province.

7
00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:24.420
Father-in-law. I have quite a lot with him.

8

I will tell you when I come here.

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:30.290
I am married. Married to my son.

10
00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:35.060
when. I don't want to make someone get married. other people.

11
00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:37.230
Are you still married?

13
00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:39.490
Who else can you have?

14
00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:41.570
Her son is just a leg

15
00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:43.990
Me I'm with her

16
00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:47.290
Too lucky

17
00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:48.190

18
00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:50.110
The Mid-Autumn Festival is out of luck

19
00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:51.190
She talked for a while

20
00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:52.570

I thought it was you

23
00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.140
It seems now

24
00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:00.850
I will eat it and give it to your dad

25
00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:03.090
I believe in my daughter’s vision

26
00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.629
The other party must be a good girl

27
00:01:05.069 --> 00:01:06.070
I'm not here for a show

28
00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:10.410
I also met my husband’s parents today, right?

29
00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:17.250
