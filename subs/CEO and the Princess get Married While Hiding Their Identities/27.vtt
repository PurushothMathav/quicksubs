00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:06.520
I will drink it for you now. We want to drink it.

2
00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:08.520
I will drink it for you now. We want to drink it.

3
00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:12.360
I thought I was possessed by the industry under the possessed body and looked like this,

4
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:13.340
I want everything from you.

5
00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.680
I understand, there is another one that people choose based on their feelings.

6
00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.820
I often go out and pretend to be pretty good, right?

7
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.340
Run away, I beg me, please talk to me, run away, run away.

8
00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:30.430
I personally kicked it out today.

9
00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:32.030
It’s just the two of you.

10
00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:41.180
Come on, run away. I just saw someone swiping the black card in the background.

11
00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:42.520
As soon as he was the vice president

12
00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.000
I am this manager

13
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.720
Poor lighting

14
00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:45.760
Give you a bad score

15
00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:46.840
I'll give the money right away

16
00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:47.980
It's still on the card over there

17
00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:49.460
After taking away King Luo’s royal property tomorrow

18
00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:50.120
Vice Governor City

19
00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.500
yes yes yes

20
00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:54.530
You are the tallest piece of clothing in this piece

21
00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:55.490
You care about your week

22
00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:56.490
Call you Deputy Mansion

23
00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:57.250
OK this

24
00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:59.590
What happened? Why do you want a vice president?

25
00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:05.900
Ah, Vice President, Vice President

26
00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:07.620
A woman who is completely invisible

27
00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:09.540
We changed the hair style to this one.

28
00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:11.020
You are the deputy governor.

29
00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.480
What's left over there

30
00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:21.880
That's the Deputy Mansion over there

31
00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:28.010
You touch it and fart

32
00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:31.270
We learn from our roots

33
00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:32.610
you want to find me

34
00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:36.160
This time I say two people are good

35
00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:37.020
There are more people there

36
00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.800
It's better to have more people like you.

37
00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:40.340
There are more people here
