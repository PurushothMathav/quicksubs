00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.840
Raw fish, it’s not long before it’s considered high in Fuji,

2
00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:07.080
It can make the lower levels cooperate.

3
00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:07.740
How could it move?

4
00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:09.480
Put a rattan frame down

5
00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.240
There is nothing wrong with the rattan frame

6
00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:13.220
Our provincial bureau is so beautiful as a whole

7
00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:17.260
This will be taken care of forever

8
00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:18.420
Don't worry

9
00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.820
People like the provincial bureau, whose morals are lower than before

10
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:22.840
Best for clean things to give up

11
00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:23.820
Decided to be able to write

12
00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:25.990
Because things like rattan wooden frames are connected over time

13
00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:26.490
A gun

14
00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:27.070
This gun

15
00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:27.510
This gun

16
00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:27.630
This gun

17
00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:27.710
This gun

18
00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.790
This gun

19
00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:29.300
This gun is Chenglian

20
00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:30.880
It's okay if you take this direction

21
00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:32.299
This kind of difficulty becomes a unified decision

22
00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:35.860
So run away and shoot.

23
00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:36.360
Don't help me

24
00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:42.660
I'm sorry, right?

25
00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.860
But it's your chance to put on a good expression

26
00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:46.680
But I’m in good hands with Xinxue’s study

27
00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.720
This level can only be opened if you have a name in the circle.

28
00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:52.030
My favorite person to predict disaster is

29
00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:53.820
And the taste is very strong

30
00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:55.930
This way you treat her well

31
00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:57.830
This taste is absolutely wrong

32
00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:03.530
I said such a big idea

33
00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:05.530
How could they appreciate me so much?

34
00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.820
It turns out that you want to withdraw from me

35
00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:09.540
I remember this
