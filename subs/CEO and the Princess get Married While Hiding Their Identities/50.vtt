00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:04.019
Yesterday we had to deal with it quickly, but now the white people are correcting the rules.

2
00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.240
Success here is a big sign of the company,

3
00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:10.760
You, a small employee, spend a lot of money just to share the wind.

4
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:11.640
It's so unintentional.

5
00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:14.660
I think you just have nothing to do and pay for it.

6
00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:17.720
There shouldn't be two rules!

7
00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:22.340
You guys estimate the method. I estimate that the method netizens use is not their own emotions.

8
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:28.080
How dare you sell someone to someone you meet?

9
00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:30.860
Really, he asked for your sympathy,

10
00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:34.830
For a girl like you, saying this does not represent your own emotions.

11
00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:39.760
although what does it mean although you

12
00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:41.400
I've never seen you respond before

13
00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:44.000
I've been kicked out of my life

14
00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:46.910
Can a media have a video angle?

15
00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:55.150
I thought everyone was left if he didn't respond.

16
00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:59.760
Work just to live with me

17
00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.270
I just want him to see me and save him.

18
00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.020
Although why is there mission smoke?

19
00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:09.900
atmosphere of state

20
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:10.880
better than eyes

21
00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:12.930
Although I don't understand

22
00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.210
Although I don't understand

23
00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:16.720
He is really infected

24
00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:18.740
This time it’s you who hears the real news

25
00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.300
Old news doesn’t explain it

26
00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:24.370
Just for the thread stuff

27
00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.500
I really don’t ask you how to deal with you when I go out

28
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:29.940
Give it to you Give it to you Tell him

29
00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:31.400
He still wants a girlfriend

30
00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.340
A game changer at the forefront of the ginseng industry

31
00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:35.240
You're such a seer

32
00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:36.760
Do you think you are helpless?

33
00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.350
Not that much

34
00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:39.610
I have eliminated the epidemic

35
00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:42.240
But how about you dress like that?

36
00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.560
Are you doing anything on this day?
