00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:07.330
Where is the death penalty? I won't discuss that.

2
00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:10.360
Now we will never find out what happened together,

3
00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:12.270
Just don't be angry.

4
00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:18.210
My own mouth. You want to be natural and double hate the things in our hearts.

5
00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:20.930
Your entire Bai family will know Da Da.

6
00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:24.290
Yes, we have always met. Especially tiring sometimes.

7
00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:26.290
This is how I like death.

8
00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.130
Just die. Should I come to see you today?

9
00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:31.650
I want to talk to you more and think more about you. The main door of the Bai family is quick.

10
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:33.700
This is also what I meant.

11
00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.720
You know, my dad was always ready for success.

12
00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.360
I'll do the same thing tonight

13
00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:39.430
There is a little thing in my heart

14
00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:41.060
I am someone else

15
00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:46.320
Self-motivated brother

16
00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:47.790
It's you who are resourceful

17
00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:49.650
More are not your student’s

18
00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:51.090
I'll get up and go

19
00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.890
At these three market meetings,

20
00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:54.890
Might be able to lure him out to you

21
00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:56.690
Let me see who dares to disrespect

22
00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:57.850
Be responsible for paying

23
00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:59.260
Say no more

24
00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:01.350
I'll bring water tonight

25
00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:02.970
The feeling of being tired of coming home after participating in the war

26
00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:04.769
If you play in a group again

27
00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:06.940
I would mind paying for something

28
00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:20.700
Don't think that you are your own brother

29
00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:21.720
I'm tired of taking you with me

30
00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:22.900
You can become less lingering

31
00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:24.700
Smoke the next month's abstract

32
00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:27.240
They are not necessarily the same

33
00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:29.580
Just wait for Samsung to give birth

34
00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:32.040
Doesn’t it count if you say it?

35
00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.960
OK go here for information

36
00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:45.190
There are times when Yan Hui is there tonight.

37
00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.060
There is always information

38
00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:50.760
Brother Yan Hui of that information

39
00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:53.000
Just run to see you instead of accumulating you like this

40
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:53.760
You are right, give it to you
