00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:02.890
Hahaha, is it very comfortable?

2
00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:04.410
Did you hear it wrong?

3
00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:06.530
Others intervene

4
00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:07.970
I heard you should try this quickly.

5
00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:09.300
Just a liar

6
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:10.500
Don't bring false news

7
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:11.740
Even my boyfriend

8
00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:13.460
I'm the general manager of Try Construction

9
00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:14.660
No need for this little white husband

10
00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:15.560
Why a hundred generations?

11
00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:22.850
My boyfriend can get it for me

12
00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:24.210
An invitation meal leading to Erhu

13
00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:26.050
Husband, is that okay?

14
00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:27.410
That's not the roof

15
00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:29.070
The pick-up meeting is enough to get out of the place

16
00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:31.430
Don't talk about Huang Huanghuang's personal fruit.

17
00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:33.630
That's where the real upper class is

18
00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.010
It’s a gift tonight

19
00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.250
Forward projection line

20
00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:38.570
This requirement shows that you are different from ordinary people.

21
00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:43.420
There are now more than 10 million young ladies on display outside.

22
00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:45.040
You are so good at being a team player

23
00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:46.380
Don't say they're together

24
00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:48.230
Miss, my girlfriend is happy

25
00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:49.610
Let’s not send them together again.

26
00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.940
Let’s talk about emotions first

27
00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:53.060
It's so kind of you to give it to me

28
00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:55.430
Have they arrived at the house?

29
00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:58.010
So we ended up giving it to your wife, so it’s interesting

30
00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:00.090
It's very valuable if you can make friends with me on the second floor

31
00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.070
Maybe

32
00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:01.830
Can work again

33
00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:03.850
This is the old face of emotions

34
00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:06.730
You two only deserve to be on this floor

35
00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:08.250
Eat free snacks

36
00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.510
The risk of being caught later

37
00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:13.160
The second floor is not interesting either.

38
00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:17.090
Do you need to talk to others more? I don’t have it either.

39
00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:18.270
No friendship

40
00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:18.990
This answer

41
00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:21.490
Isn't all this embarrassing enough?

42
00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:22.630
I have no friendship

43
00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:23.570
It's me, I need it

44
00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:25.730
That's like you

45
00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:26.490
no self

46
00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.050
It will succeed again

47
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.220
Even if it is possible, it will not succeed

48
00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:35.710
Don't you feel angry later?

49
00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:36.590
Invited him again

50
00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:38.910
I've been waiting for a while.

51
00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:40.350
You can be sure that it will take less than a minute

52
00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:41.490
I don't dare to tell you
