00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.300
A month, maybe less than half a month

2
00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:04.333
Otherwise, my godmother will throw all the money here

3
00:00:04.333 --> 00:00:05.833
You really think I'm stupid.

4
00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:07.100
I thought so.

5
00:00:07.133 --> 00:00:08.466
You are starting

6
00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:10.333
Not so much?

7
00:00:10.333 --> 00:00:12.266
If I'm not wrong

8
00:00:12.533 --> 00:00:13.600
This land

9
00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:15.866
It's to be dismantled.

10
00:00:16.966 --> 00:00:19.000
Otherwise, why would the Wang family set their sights on this?

11
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.366
What if it is demolished?

12
00:00:20.366 --> 00:00:22.200
Mr. Ye, you are going to make a lot of money.

13
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:23.633
And Mr. Ye

14
00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:25.000
In that case

15
00:00:25.066 --> 00:00:26.500
You should be more careful.

16
00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:27.366
Think about it.

17
00:00:27.366 --> 00:00:29.600
You robbed the Wang family's land and made money

18
00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.566
They won't let us go

19
00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.033
There are no soldiers to flood the water and soil

20
00:00:35.566 --> 00:00:37.000
His Wang family is rich

21
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.600
I, Ye Fan, have no money now

22
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.966
That's true. But Mr. Yip?

23
00:00:41.966 --> 00:00:44.266
I still advise you to go out as little as possible

24
00:00:44.266 --> 00:00:45.466
Their royal family

25
00:00:45.533 --> 00:00:46.900
No rules

26
00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:48.566
Don't worry, hide

27
00:00:58.366 --> 00:01:01.033
Dear, you are back.

28
00:01:02.866 --> 00:01:05.433
Honey, why are you so angry?

29
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.066
Did you find the person who robbed your land last week?

30
00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.266
Found it, guess who it is?

31
00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:15.266
Who is it? It's your useless fiancÃ©

32
00:01:15.466 --> 00:01:17.466
He paid 70,000 yuan later

33
00:01:17.466 --> 00:01:19.633
Bought me all that damn chicken

34
00:01:20.366 --> 00:01:21.533
That's impossible.

35
00:01:21.533 --> 00:01:22.266
Absolutely impossible

36
00:01:22.266 --> 00:01:23.700
You've got it wrong.
