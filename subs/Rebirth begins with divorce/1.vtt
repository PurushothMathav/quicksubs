You think I've been through it all?

28
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.400

It is impossible for Master Jiang to sit in the hospital and wait to die

00:02:05.066 --> 00:02:06.833
Children are worried about gains and losses

50
00:02:08.366 --> 00:02:09.600

Brother Ye Fan, what are you talking about?

60
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.900
Today is January 15th, 1992

61
00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:43.366
The day you married Sister Huang Yun

62
00:02:43.366 --> 00:02:44.800
Can you forget this?
