00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.900
Are we really going to sell all day?

2
00:00:01.933 --> 00:00:03.266
To sell, of course to sell

3
00:00:03.266 --> 00:00:04.400
If you don't sell it, it will be too late.

4
00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:06.700
Isn't this the Dionysian of Huashan?

5
00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:10.466
Why did you come to the stock market to perm and dye wine again today?

6
00:00:10.966 --> 00:00:13.366
I'm not interested in fighting with you.

7
00:00:13.366 --> 00:00:16.000
I'm here to sell my shares and certifications

8
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:17.966
What stocks to sell?

9
00:00:17.966 --> 00:00:18.766
certification

10
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.766
Corporate hahahaha

11
00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.700
How many people have cut their heads and drilled into the stock market now?

12
00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:26.366
You sold it again?

13
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.466
Yes, Mr. Ray

14
00:00:27.466 --> 00:00:29.500
Now stock tanks can make money

15
00:00:29.566 --> 00:00:31.500
I can't help but ask you to sell it.

16
00:00:32.066 --> 00:00:34.600
For real estate development on Nanhai Island

17
00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:35.800
Trying very well

18
00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.466
But I don't have enough cash on hand

19
00:00:37.466 --> 00:00:40.066
I can only sell this first and go there to develop it well

20
00:00:40.566 --> 00:00:42.000
Ye Fan, Ye Fan

21
00:00:42.166 --> 00:00:45.366
Look at who's brain is broken hahaha

22
00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.000
The happiness of real estate

23
00:00:50.533 --> 00:00:52.666
Since Wang Shao is so unfortunate

24
00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.233
Why don't we make a deal?

25
00:00:54.666 --> 00:00:55.466
All right?

26
00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:56.900
What deal?

27
00:00:57.333 --> 00:00:59.766
Don't you have a lot of real estate in Huahai?

28
00:00:59.766 --> 00:01:02.566
So since you're not planning to do real estate anymore

29
00:01:02.566 --> 00:01:05.166
Why don't I offer the market price?

30
00:01:05.266 --> 00:01:07.800
Sell it to me at 100 million price

31
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.800
Are you sure?

32
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.133
This is what you said. Go

33
00:01:11.133 --> 00:01:12.366
Let's sign the contract now

34
00:01:12.366 --> 00:01:13.400
Ok

35
00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.066
Go go go go

36
00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.833
What happened to Mr. Ye?

37
00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:26.700
stock market

38
00:01:27.166 --> 00:01:28.100
Collapse
