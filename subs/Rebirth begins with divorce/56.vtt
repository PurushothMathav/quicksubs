00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:08.800
Mr. Ye?

2
00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:11.133
This is the security my dad found for you

3
00:00:11.133 --> 00:00:12.433
Named Linna

4
00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.000
Hello, my name is Ye Fan.

5
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.800
Can you try your skills?

6
00:00:17.366 --> 00:00:18.233
Are you sure?

7
00:00:19.333 --> 00:00:20.700
I also learned a little

8
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:22.000
It's okay, give it a try.

9
00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:23.500
Hey

10
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:28.266
I took it, I took it, I took it

11
00:00:28.266 --> 00:00:29.333
Ok ok ok ok

12
00:00:29.333 --> 00:00:31.200
Then hurry up and let Mr. Ye go.

13
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:32.666
Now your employer

14
00:00:32.733 --> 00:00:33.866
Tell Uncle Xu

15
00:00:33.866 --> 00:00:36.300
I'll definitely stop by after a while. Thank you

16
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.066
That time

17
00:00:37.066 --> 00:00:39.066
I'll take you to meet the person you want to protect

18
00:00:39.066 --> 00:00:39.700
treatment

19
00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:41.866
I don't know what Uncle Xu told you

20
00:00:41.866 --> 00:00:45.000
Anyway, I won't treat you badly.

21
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.166
As for what do you need?

22
00:00:46.166 --> 00:00:47.433
You can also mention it to me.

23
00:00:48.133 --> 00:00:50.200
Then let's go meet

24
00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.000
Is the former eldest sister a bodyguard?

25
00:00:56.666 --> 00:00:58.666
Ah, Brother Ye Fan, I don't want bodyguards

26
00:01:00.866 --> 00:01:01.666
Cher

27
00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.566
Yes, now because of the money

28
00:01:05.566 --> 00:01:07.600
I offended some people out there.

29
00:01:08.266 --> 00:01:10.100
You are my future wife

30
00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:11.400
They can't take me

31
00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.000
I will naturally find a way to attack you

32
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.466
Whether it's for me

33
00:01:14.566 --> 00:01:15.766
Or for you?

34
00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:16.800
tight

35
00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:18.866
Must be by your side

36
00:01:20.133 --> 00:01:23.333
OK then. I'll go buy some toiletries.

37
00:01:23.333 --> 00:01:25.233
Grandpa's towel needs to be changed

38
00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.166
Sister Qin Na Supermarket is not far from here

39
00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.400
You don't have to follow

40
00:01:30.666 --> 00:01:32.233
It's my duty to follow you

41
00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.866
No matter where Cher goes

42
00:01:34.866 --> 00:01:37.233
Qin Na must be by your side

43
00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:38.433
Otherwise, I don't worry.

44
00:01:44.133 --> 00:01:46.466
Sister Qin, how old are you? 20

45
00:01:49.133 --> 00:01:51.100
Whoa whoa whoa brothers

46
00:01:51.133 --> 00:01:52.500

47
00:01:53.766 --> 00:01:56.566
