00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:03.600
Xiaofan

2
00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.600
Grandpa Jiang and I chose three days for you.

3
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.366
One is the twenty-eighth day of the first lunar month

4
00:00:08.366 --> 00:00:09.366
Just in time for the Lantern Festival

5
00:00:09.366 --> 00:00:10.833
As soon as I get married, you see

6
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.200
February

7
00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:16.600
Lantern Festival is not Cher

8
00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.266
When grandpa was diagnosed with leukemia?

9
00:00:18.266 --> 00:00:20.166
How could I have forgotten about this?

10
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:21.933
I'm such a beast

11
00:00:21.933 --> 00:00:23.100
I just think about making money

12
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.500
I forgot something so important

13
00:00:24.933 --> 00:00:25.933
Xiaofan, what are you doing?

14
00:00:25.933 --> 00:00:28.166
That dad, don't you worry about that day?

15
00:00:28.166 --> 00:00:29.666
I have to go to Master Jiang's first

16
00:00:30.566 --> 00:00:31.566
What is this?

17
00:00:33.366 --> 00:00:35.500
Grandpa Jiang Xiaoye

18
00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:37.366
Cher is in the house

19
00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:40.000
No, have you been coughing up blood recently?

20
00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:41.966
What!

21
00:00:41.966 --> 00:00:44.833
Grandpa, you're coughing up blood, don't listen to Xiaoye's nonsense

22
00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:47.166
Grandpa, this is all an old problem.

23
00:00:47.166 --> 00:00:49.633
When the day changes, I feel like coughing

24
00:00:53.666 --> 00:00:54.966
Grandpa can

25
00:00:55.133 --> 00:00:56.500
You said you didn't cough up blood
