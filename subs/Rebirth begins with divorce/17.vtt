00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.466
Something really happened.

2
00:00:01.466 --> 00:00:02.466
Just now

3
00:00:02.466 --> 00:00:04.133
I checked with a parked motorcycle

4
00:00:04.133 --> 00:00:05.566
I thought it was nothing

5
00:00:05.666 --> 00:00:06.566
Just about to leave.

6
00:00:06.566 --> 00:00:08.000
The last one suddenly fell off.

7
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.100
Did you hit anyone?

8
00:00:09.266 --> 00:00:10.366
Check when checking

9
00:00:11.166 --> 00:00:12.466
Check it out.

10
00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:13.766
What is the reason?

11
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:17.566
No one?

12
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:19.033
Definitely not the so-called practice

13
00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:19.666
Is a fault

14
00:00:19.666 --> 00:00:21.866
The master in charge of inspection has studied it for you.

15
00:00:21.866 --> 00:00:23.266
Is the largest of the other Rust Parties

16
00:00:23.733 --> 00:00:24.966
Abandoned wealth rusts

17
00:00:25.466 --> 00:00:27.366
Why are these security guards late?

18
00:00:27.533 --> 00:00:29.400
I can't find this kind of problem.

19
00:00:29.966 --> 00:00:31.500
That's what I'm trying to say.

20
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.700
The security guard of our scratched amusement park

21
00:00:33.733 --> 00:00:34.366
Asked for leave to go home

22
00:00:34.366 --> 00:00:35.633
So no one has been in charge

23
00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:37.066
The master in charge of inspection said

24
00:00:37.066 --> 00:00:38.266
If you press two more days to find out

25
00:00:38.266 --> 00:00:39.100
Something will definitely happen

26
00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:48.233
That is to say

27
00:00:48.866 --> 00:00:51.500
Not as small as this kid today

28
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.333
It's doomed

29
00:00:53.333 --> 00:00:54.400
That's it.

30
00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:57.900
I want to meet this man of God in person

31
00:00:58.300 --> 00:00:59.833
Thank him well

32
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.100
What do you want him for?

33
00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:02.966
The reputation we have accumulated in Huahai for many years

34
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.633
I'm afraid it's going to be destroyed

35
00:01:06.933 --> 00:01:09.333
Brother Ye Fan, what are we doing in the city?

36
00:01:09.333 --> 00:01:10.366
What to see

37
00:01:10.733 --> 00:01:11.866
Of course! To save up!

38
00:01:11.866 --> 00:01:13.066
So much money, let it go

39
00:01:14.166 --> 00:01:14.966
You too.

40
00:01:19.166 --> 00:01:21.500
It's late at night, let me tell you

41
00:01:21.966 --> 00:01:23.600
Big colleagues are not finished
