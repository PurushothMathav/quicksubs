00:00:02.066 --> 00:00:03.666
January 1992

2
00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:05.300
Huang Ying's barren merchant just sold it

3
00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:06.900
He was taken by a wealthy businessperson

4
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:08.700
The price has doubled ten times

5
00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:10.633
Also this month

6
00:00:10.766 --> 00:00:12.566
The official sale of Huahai stock subscription certificates

7
00:00:12.566 --> 00:00:14.366
Prices go up all the way

8
00:00:14.466 --> 00:00:17.600
It was praised by later generations as the 92 Fortune Certificate

9
00:00:18.266 --> 00:00:20.600
In 1992, major industries

10
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.700
Both started to grow rapidly

11
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:24.500
This industry

12
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:27.066
Forget it first

13
00:00:28.066 --> 00:00:29.233
In this lifetime

14
00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.766
I will never make you feel better

15
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:38.800
Dad, what's the matter with you?

16
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:39.966
What else could it be?

17
00:00:40.066 --> 00:00:42.866
The mother and daughter surnamed Wang insist that you break off the marriage and start again

18
00:00:42.866 --> 00:00:45.433
What did you say? You refused to return the bride price money.

19
00:00:46.366 --> 00:00:47.800
What did I do?

20
00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:48.766
You walk at home

21
00:00:48.933 --> 00:00:50.500
I'm looking for an answer

22
00:00:50.566 --> 00:00:52.500
A customer with the last name is not a good person

23
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.566
Don't be impulsive dad

24
00:00:54.666 --> 00:00:55.833
Son has his own measure

25
00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.000
Just wait for me at home with peace of mind

26
00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.400
Just get the money back
