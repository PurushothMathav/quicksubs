00:00:02.533 --> 00:00:05.433
Did you force yourself when you signed this?

2
00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:07.600
Since I didn't force you

3
00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:08.966
What are you doing here?

4
00:00:09.133 --> 00:00:09.766
Sold all sold

5
00:00:09.766 --> 00:00:11.266
What does the price increase have to do with you?

6
00:00:11.266 --> 00:00:13.200
Go, go, don't make noise here

7
00:00:13.533 --> 00:00:17.500
Okay, Nian, you have the guts to wait for me

8
00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.566
We're not done with this

9
00:00:22.166 --> 00:00:23.033
Wait

10
00:00:24.766 --> 00:00:26.400
Deputy Chief Yang

11
00:00:26.533 --> 00:00:27.700
Thanks.

12
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.900
There are really people who are willing to pay a high price for that Huangshan Mountain

13
00:00:30.933 --> 00:00:32.500
Can this be fake?

14
00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.233
This guy is sitting in the brigade

15
00:00:34.466 --> 00:00:35.933
As long as you get to the area

16
00:00:35.933 --> 00:00:37.266
It will be advanced soon.

17
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.500
Why don't you hurry up?

18
00:00:39.766 --> 00:00:41.766
The village chief, I would like to ask

19
00:00:41.766 --> 00:00:44.000
How much can that person pay?

20
00:00:45.733 --> 00:00:48.133
Eight thousand what eight thousand?

21
00:00:48.133 --> 00:00:50.300
Optimistic about 80,000

22
00:00:50.466 --> 00:00:52.566
Eighty thousand is so much.

23
00:00:52.733 --> 00:00:56.233
That broken mountain can be sold for so much money

24
00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:57.366
Didn't you say it all?

25
00:00:57.366 --> 00:00:58.500
People are in the brigade

26
00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:59.800
All the money is brought

27
00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:01.200
Is it true?

28
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.600
You take the enemy plane and go over and take a look

29
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:03.866
Don't you know?

30
00:01:04.566 --> 00:01:05.433
80,000

31
00:01:05.966 --> 00:01:07.800
The price is similar to the previous life.

32
00:01:08.466 --> 00:01:09.900
Uncle Dad, let's go see

33
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.833
Let's go, feel it coming
