00:00:00.466 --> 00:00:01.400
That's impossible.

2
00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:02.133
Absolutely impossible

3
00:00:02.133 --> 00:00:04.066
You've got it wrong. What's impossible?

4
00:00:04.066 --> 00:00:04.966
The photo I took here

5
00:00:04.966 --> 00:00:06.366
I have checked with the villagers

6
00:00:06.366 --> 00:00:07.166
That's right.

7
00:00:07.166 --> 00:00:09.633
He's never even been in the city.

8
00:00:09.733 --> 00:00:11.233
How could there be so much money?

9
00:00:11.333 --> 00:00:12.333
What a mistake

10
00:00:12.333 --> 00:00:14.566
You ask me, who do I ask?

11
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.133
As a result, the comparison has been bought by him.

12
00:00:16.133 --> 00:00:17.300
What could I do?

13
00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:20.800
Ah, who is he?

14
00:00:21.066 --> 00:00:23.866
Whoa, hey, okay, okay.

15
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.200
Hey, okay, okay, okay.

16
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:26.700
I'll be right over.

17
00:00:28.533 --> 00:00:30.333
Dear, what happened?

18
00:00:30.333 --> 00:00:32.233
Leave me alone

19
00:00:39.566 --> 00:00:41.200
Dad, you are looking for me

20
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.866
Prodigal son, you have the face to come back

21
00:00:44.866 --> 00:00:46.433
Mom, what happened?

22
00:00:47.866 --> 00:00:48.700
See for yourself

23
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:54.800
This

24
00:00:55.066 --> 00:00:56.666
Ocean Park is open
