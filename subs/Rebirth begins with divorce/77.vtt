00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:02.800
Of course, are you sure you didn't listen to the host?

2
00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:06.600
It's just a bigger blue crystal

3
00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:10.433
Then open your dog eyes and see clearly

4
00:00:10.866 --> 00:00:12.000
Don't be so ignorant.

5
00:00:13.766 --> 00:00:14.666
This is a branch.

6
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:17.366
Queen of Great Britain

7
00:00:17.366 --> 00:00:19.700
Once made two ocean stars

8
00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:21.366
One of them

9
00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.966
With the Titanic

10
00:00:24.466 --> 00:00:25.666
Unify and become famous

11
00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:27.366
And another person

12
00:00:27.966 --> 00:00:29.566
One that has been placed so far

13
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.200
What do you mean?

14
00:00:32.266 --> 00:00:33.900
This blue crystal in your hand

15
00:00:33.933 --> 00:00:35.966
Another kind of ocean star

16
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.166
Listen to this guy

17
00:00:39.333 --> 00:00:42.400
This blue crystal really looks a bit like the heart of the ocean

18
00:00:42.566 --> 00:00:43.800
This blue crystal

19
00:00:44.266 --> 00:00:45.533
It has been passed down in the folk for so long

20
00:00:45.533 --> 00:00:48.400
If this crystal is really the heart of the ocean

21
00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:49.966
He has been in the folk for so long

22
00:00:49.966 --> 00:00:51.266
It was already discovered by others

23
00:00:51.266 --> 00:00:52.266
True number false number

24
00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.633
Find an expert to identify the knowledge

25
00:00:55.566 --> 00:00:59.333
Coincidentally, I do know a regulatory expert

26
00:00:59.333 --> 00:01:01.066
I'll call him over now

27
00:01:01.166 --> 00:01:04.766
I'd like to see if he still executes
