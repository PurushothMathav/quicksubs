1
00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.100
That Mr. Ye

2
00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.700
What are your plans next?

3
00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:06.833
Are you really going to vote?

4
00:00:06.933 --> 00:00:08.566
Real estate on Nanhai Island

5
00:00:08.566 --> 00:00:12.233
If the stock market in August was a big hole

6
00:00:12.266 --> 00:00:14.166
Then Nanhai Island Real Estate

7
00:00:14.733 --> 00:00:16.133
It's sinkhole.

8
00:00:16.133 --> 00:00:17.200
What you said before

9
00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.700
But that's what I said specifically to Wang Pan

10
00:00:21.333 --> 00:00:22.833
Who believes who is unlucky

11
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.300
Oh, Mr. Takaba.

12
00:00:26.366 --> 00:00:30.100
Your tricks are too high

13
00:00:32.133 --> 00:00:34.266
5 days short 5 days

14
00:00:34.266 --> 00:00:36.866
We can go out with almost half of our family

15
00:00:37.766 --> 00:00:39.200
Go on like this

16
00:00:39.366 --> 00:00:42.366
Our family is really doomed

17
00:00:42.533 --> 00:00:45.866
Dad, do I remember going down?

18
00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:49.566
Yan civilization once said before

19
00:00:49.566 --> 00:00:52.666
Nanhai real estate daughter new products

20
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.900
Xinye's brother really said that

21
00:00:57.133 --> 00:00:59.133
It was my lie and I heard it

22
00:00:59.133 --> 00:01:00.366
You can ask him.

23
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:01.266
OK, OK.

24
00:01:01.266 --> 00:01:04.066
What do you want to say about whether the stock is unbought?

25
00:01:04.166 --> 00:01:04.966
still

26
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.200
Your eyes are surprisingly good

27
00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.600
This time, since he said it

28
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.066
Nanhai Island will not force the sea

29
00:01:12.133 --> 00:01:16.466
For example, if I bet with him

30
00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.233
Okay, I'll leave it to you. Okay
