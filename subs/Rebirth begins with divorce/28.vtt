Hello brother ye

2
00:00:00.966 --> 00:00:03.233
Mr. Xu gave you a day out

3
00:00:03.666 --> 00:00:04.700
Thanks

4
00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:08.466
Hey, Mr. Ye

5
00:00:09.066 --> 00:00:10.566
What's next?

6
00:00:10.566 --> 00:00:11.866
Do you want to stroll in Huahai?

7
00:00:12.166 --> 00:00:13.666
I just wanted to go out for a walk

8
00:00:13.666 --> 00:00:14.866
Buy something to go home

9
00:00:14.866 --> 00:00:18.333
It just so happens that Xiaowang grew up in Huahai

10
00:00:18.333 --> 00:00:19.500
I also like to shop around

11
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.600
Let him show you around

12
00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:23.666
That's right. What does Mr. Ye want to buy?

13
00:00:23.666 --> 00:00:24.600
Tell me directly

14
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:25.900
I'll take you there.

15
00:00:26.366 --> 00:00:27.833
Then I'll definitely not be polite to you.

16
00:00:29.866 --> 00:00:30.666
Mr. Ye

17
00:00:30.766 --> 00:00:34.000
How do you say you're a millionaire now?

18
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.466
How can you not even have a pager?

19
00:00:35.466 --> 00:00:37.366
If anything happens, no one can find it.

20
00:00:37.566 --> 00:00:40.400
Didn't you think so much at once?

21
00:00:42.466 --> 00:00:44.466
I didn't expect them to meet so early

22
00:00:44.466 --> 00:00:46.100
No wonder

23
00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.766
Wife wife

24
00:00:46.766 --> 00:00:48.933
I heard you are pregnant, let me kiss you

25
00:00:48.933 --> 00:00:50.266
What are you listening to?

26
00:00:50.933 --> 00:00:53.100
Already hit

27
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.100
Why is that?

28
00:00:56.466 --> 00:00:57.566
So much why

29
00:00:57.566 --> 00:00:59.300
Can you afford it?

30
00:01:01.333 --> 00:01:03.100
What's wrong with Mr. Li?
