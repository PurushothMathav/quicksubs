00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:01.966
Mom promised him

2
00:00:01.966 --> 00:00:04.366
Anyway, there's really nothing wrong with our product.

3
00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:06.800
I really bought a lot more money for Lao Jin

4
00:00:06.866 --> 00:00:09.900
How dare our group give them half?

5
00:00:10.366 --> 00:00:12.366
Ok, I promise you.

6
00:00:12.366 --> 00:00:13.500
self-curling

7
00:00:13.933 --> 00:00:16.166
Let's sign it

8
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.966
Li Min, did anyone not recognize the account at that time? Just sign it.

9
00:00:27.166 --> 00:00:27.966
Ah, it's still you

10
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.066

11
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.933
Wow, how did you make a fortune?

12
00:00:36.933 --> 00:00:38.966
10,000 bucks for a bottle of sweet potatoes like that

13
00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:40.400
And entertained him.

14
00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:41.600
Really useless

15
00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.466
Luckily we have some hardware

16
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.200
But I want to be unlucky for the rest of my life

17
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.000
Chen Mei

18
00:00:47.733 --> 00:00:49.233
Lady Chen Mei

19
00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.200
Why are you here?

20
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:52.566
What are you doing?

21
00:00:54.566 --> 00:00:56.966
I made a fortune in your house hahaha made a fortune

22
00:00:56.966 --> 00:00:57.933
What kind of wealth?

23
00:00:57.933 --> 00:00:59.600
There is a rich man in the city

24
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.066
It is said to be matched with the barren mountain behind your house

25
00:01:02.066 --> 00:01:03.466
80,000 buy him

26
00:01:03.466 --> 00:01:06.800
What? The emperor in my house is in tatters.

27
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:07.600
Yes!

28
00:01:08.366 --> 00:01:11.033
Ah, no village chief

29
00:01:11.366 --> 00:01:12.466
Are you kidding me?

30
00:01:12.466 --> 00:01:15.100
Oh, I can joke. Oh, yeah.

31
00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.300
If you sell it, hurry up and prepare the earth gas

32
00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:18.900
I'll take you to sign the contract later

33
00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:20.600
No way.

34
00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.466
I'm going to find the trash of that business now

35
00:01:22.466 --> 00:01:23.633
Bring the address

36
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.500
This can't go forward that kind of waste
