00:00:00.866 --> 00:00:02.900
What's wrong with Mr. Li?

2
00:00:03.133 --> 00:00:05.566
Isn't that the kid who robbed you that day?

3
00:00:05.566 --> 00:00:07.366
How did they get mixed up?

4
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:10.700
Do you know the man in the middle?

5
00:00:11.333 --> 00:00:12.433
Wang Kuan?

6
00:00:12.533 --> 00:00:15.500
Who doesn't know him?

7
00:00:19.066 --> 00:00:20.366
Does the boss have the latest model?

8
00:00:20.366 --> 00:00:22.000
There are two bosses

9
00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:23.700
Latest model

10
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:26.866
Hahaha boss, he takes two BB machines.

11
00:00:27.466 --> 00:00:28.266
Yo

12
00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:31.466
I didn't expect it to happen.

13
00:00:31.566 --> 00:00:33.233
I'm out again

14
00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:39.166
Oh, this is your useless fiancé?

15
00:00:39.466 --> 00:00:41.266
Haha fiancé

16
00:00:41.533 --> 00:00:44.166
What's the matter with Mr. Jin, Uncle Lei?

17
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.266
I used to be blind and saw a trash

18
00:00:48.266 --> 00:00:50.766
I didn't expect people to pick up trash these days

19
00:00:50.766 --> 00:00:51.733
What does your mother mean?

20
00:00:51.733 --> 00:00:54.300
I pick up your trash, don't I?

21
00:00:54.766 --> 00:00:55.900
What's wrong, bastard?

22
00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:57.266
You are not the king of heaven

23
00:00:57.266 --> 00:00:59.100
Mr. Ye is a distinguished guest of our Xu family

24
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.333
If you dare to follow me today

25
00:01:00.333 --> 00:01:02.300
I promise I'll let you go

26
00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.700
Xujia Feilong Group

27
00:01:07.366 --> 00:01:08.766
I said this hillbilly

28
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.866
Where did the courage come from to be so arrogant?

29
00:01:11.066 --> 00:01:12.966
It turned out to be looking for a backer

30
00:01:12.966 --> 00:01:14.866
Hahahaha

31
00:01:15.333 --> 00:01:16.133
Industrial

32
00:01:16.733 --> 00:01:18.233
I'm not talking about you.

33
00:01:18.566 --> 00:01:21.800
Don't hide behind others if you have the guts.

34
00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.200
How dare you hit my father?
