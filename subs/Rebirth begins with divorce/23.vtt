00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:04.900
1 million '92 1 million

2
00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.400
No, just a casual reminder

3
00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:08.466
It hurts.

4
00:00:08.466 --> 00:00:09.266
I can't take it

5
00:00:09.266 --> 00:00:10.900
Can't take Mr. Ye

6
00:00:10.966 --> 00:00:12.366
Just 1 million

7
00:00:12.533 --> 00:00:13.566
It looks like a lot.

8
00:00:13.566 --> 00:00:14.766
But for us Xu

9
00:00:14.766 --> 00:00:16.966
For the entire prestige and fortune of the family

10
00:00:16.966 --> 00:00:18.900
But it's not enough.

11
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.200
You must take it

12
00:00:20.366 --> 00:00:24.000
It's Mr. Lin, you must accept it, if it weren't for you?

13
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.833
Our Xu family may be finished

14
00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:27.833
Now that I've said that

15
00:00:28.333 --> 00:00:29.533
I'm not welcome either.

16
00:00:29.533 --> 00:00:31.900
But I'm not taking it for free.

17
00:00:32.266 --> 00:00:34.500
I have a profitable business

18
00:00:34.666 --> 00:00:37.600
I wonder if Mr. Xu is interested

19
00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:39.700
What profitable business do you promise?

20
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.366
That wait, I'll get it, I'll get it

21
00:00:44.566 --> 00:00:45.466
Haha brother

22
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:46.500
Here it is.

23
00:00:46.766 --> 00:00:47.966
Absolute violence

24
00:00:48.266 --> 00:00:49.666
Why don't you shop so much?

25
00:00:49.666 --> 00:00:51.000
30 bucks each.

26
00:00:51.066 --> 00:00:53.800
You still need a lottery to buy this stock?

27
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.433
It must be a scam.

28
00:00:55.933 --> 00:00:58.033
Oh, Mr. Xu!

29
00:00:58.133 --> 00:01:00.433
I've seen people play this stock at the time

30
00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.966
It's about making money, but it's also very risky.

31
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:06.466
If you're not careful, you can go bankrupt

32
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.000
That's right, Uncle Wei is in America.

33
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.500
Just because of playing stocks

34
00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.033
So the name wife?

35
00:01:13.166 --> 00:01:13.900
Mr. Ye

36
00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:16.800
Don't listen to others fooling you, come on

37
00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:17.900
I can't help it.

38
00:01:18.333 --> 00:01:19.700
If you believe me

39
00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:20.900
Just come with me.

40
00:01:21.466 --> 00:01:22.766
Anyway, this time?

41
00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.266
I'm going to throw all the money in my hand

42
00:01:25.266 --> 00:01:27.866
1 million all smashed in

43
00:01:28.966 --> 00:01:32.033
This is too big without exemption

44
00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:34.866
Is it Mr. Ye?

45
00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:36.833
Went to see again
