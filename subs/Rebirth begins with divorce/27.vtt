1
00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.900
Yes, I'll take it.

2
00:00:02.666 --> 00:00:04.066
Put our big brother Li down first

3
00:00:04.066 --> 00:00:05.766
Don't worry, I bought it.

4
00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:07.566
I guess you don't dare to play with me

5
00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.200
Thank you little brother, what are you thanking me for?

6
00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.166
I happen to be here to buy this too

7
00:00:13.366 --> 00:00:15.333
But I want to buy more.

8
00:00:15.333 --> 00:00:17.433
You see, this is not a way.

9
00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:18.566
Oh yes yes

10
00:00:18.566 --> 00:00:20.500
I have as many as you want.

11
00:00:21.466 --> 00:00:23.033
Let's 1 million first

12
00:00:23.766 --> 00:00:26.400
Ah, you want to buy 1 million

13
00:00:27.966 --> 00:00:30.300
Little brother, you bought too much.

14
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.900
Although I also know that this thing can make money

15
00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:34.266
But it's too risky.

16
00:00:34.266 --> 00:00:36.633
Why don't you buy less and try it first?

17
00:00:36.733 --> 00:00:37.966
Brother Li

18
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.100
This opportunity to make money

19
00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:41.733
How can I try it?

20
00:00:41.733 --> 00:00:44.700
As the so-called wealth and wealth insurance

21
00:00:45.166 --> 00:00:47.766
Your stuff is too expensive, Mr. Ye is right

22
00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:49.866
Wealth and wealth

23
00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:51.300
This brother

24
00:00:51.533 --> 00:00:53.633
Give me 500,000 too

25
00:00:55.933 --> 00:00:57.900
Crazy absolutely crazy

26
00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.100
One 1 million one 500,000

27
00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.166
Isn't this money?

28
00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:07.266
Go go go

29
00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:09.100
Absolutely insane.

30
00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.766
It's too risky

31
00:01:12.766 --> 00:01:14.266
Why don't you buy less?

32
00:01:14.266 --> 00:01:15.266
Brother Li

33
00:01:15.266 --> 00:01:17.366
Just rest assured to help us buy it.

34
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.866
I definitely don't blame you for something wrong

35
00:01:21.166 --> 00:01:23.200
And if you believe me

36
00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:24.466
You can come with us.

37
00:01:24.733 --> 00:01:25.966
Definitely make money

38
00:01:26.266 --> 00:01:28.800
Oh, that's fine.

39
00:01:29.333 --> 00:01:31.000
Then I'll give it to you.

40
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.033
Please wait for me now.

41
00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:36.666
Don't be nervous.

42
00:01:36.966 --> 00:01:40.100
I'm using my wife to control the virus, haha.

43
00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.466
Don't have that relationship with me, okay?

44
00:01:42.466 --> 00:01:43.833
This time I'll take you through a book

45
00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.366
Just marry a few more wives haha
