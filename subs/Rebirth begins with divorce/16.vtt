00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:01.166
Ah!

2
00:00:01.733 --> 00:00:02.633
He's back!

3
00:00:03.333 --> 00:00:04.300
Is that you?

4
00:00:05.533 --> 00:00:07.600
Smooth and smooth

5
00:00:09.133 --> 00:00:10.200
What is it?

6
00:00:10.333 --> 00:00:13.266
It's the one that sold it to my first villager. It's weird

7
00:00:13.366 --> 00:00:14.600
He told me.

8
00:00:14.766 --> 00:00:16.666
He has the ability to predict the future

9
00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:18.566
The ability to predict the future

10
00:00:19.366 --> 00:00:20.800
What does he know?

11
00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.666
He said that the Ferris wheel in our playground

12
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:24.366
There is a safety hazard

13
00:00:24.366 --> 00:00:25.100
Something might happen.

14
00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:26.966
I thought it was some kind of trick theory

15
00:00:26.966 --> 00:00:28.966
Just a charlatan

16
00:00:29.066 --> 00:00:31.166
It's not that you don't know our amusement park

17
00:00:31.166 --> 00:00:33.233
It's checked every day.

18
00:00:33.333 --> 00:00:35.100
How could there be a problem?

19
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.300
At first I thought he was dying too

20
00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:40.200
I don't know why.

21
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.266
The thought of his seriousness

22
00:00:42.366 --> 00:00:43.800
I always have an idea in my heart

23
00:00:45.133 --> 00:00:46.466
It's still early anyway

24
00:00:46.866 --> 00:00:48.100
If you don't believe me

25
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.000
You can also check it now.

26
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.500
Ok I'll go

27
00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.466
Dinner is ready, sir. Okay

28
00:01:03.966 --> 00:01:05.900
Ah, I appear seriously
