00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:02.766
Which branch do we buy next?

2
00:00:02.766 --> 00:00:04.200
Let me think about it.

3
00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.766
But I know it's true now.

4
00:00:06.766 --> 00:00:09.966
No matter which one you buy, don't buy it as long as you don't buy it indiscriminately.

5
00:00:11.966 --> 00:00:14.666
Not good, it's really a narrow road for enemies

6
00:00:14.666 --> 00:00:16.166
This is not yours.

7
00:00:16.166 --> 00:00:18.533
I made some money by relying on the prosperity of the Xu family

8
00:00:18.533 --> 00:00:19.500
does it cost labor

9
00:00:19.866 --> 00:00:21.800
It's just bad luck

10
00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.000
How about living at home?

11
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.766
Also learn to trade stocks

12
00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:27.066
Don't pee?

13
00:00:27.066 --> 00:00:30.100
Look in the mirror and don't see if you deserve it or not

14
00:00:30.166 --> 00:00:31.366
We don't deserve it.

15
00:00:31.366 --> 00:00:34.066
What do you deserve, you high-ranking bitch?

16
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.066
Just ignore them.

17
00:00:35.066 --> 00:00:36.266
The chef starts running now

18
00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:38.300
Hey wait

19
00:00:38.666 --> 00:00:39.400
kid

20
00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:42.100
I heard you've bought a lot of subscription cards recently, right?

21
00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.066
None of your business, none of my business

22
00:00:44.066 --> 00:00:46.000
But I want to be with you

23
00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.733
Doing anything is naturally betting on stocks

24
00:00:49.733 --> 00:00:52.266
We both offer a certain amount of money

25
00:00:52.266 --> 00:00:53.766
Go bet on a stock

26
00:00:53.766 --> 00:00:54.733
No concurrence

27
00:00:54.733 --> 00:00:56.333
Wait until a certain amount of time

28
00:00:56.333 --> 00:00:59.033
Whoever gives the stock the biggest increase

29
00:00:59.066 --> 00:01:00.500
And the stakes

30
00:01:00.666 --> 00:01:01.866
Just bet you are betting

31
00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:05.333
Mr. Li, don't trust him.

32
00:01:05.333 --> 00:01:07.133
This guy has been in the city lately

33
00:01:07.133 --> 00:01:08.366
And I made a lot of money.

34
00:01:08.366 --> 00:01:09.500
He dares to bet with you

35
00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:10.866
You must have your own confidence.

36
00:01:10.966 --> 00:01:12.866
Hahahaha

37
00:01:13.666 --> 00:01:14.466
how

38
00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:15.800
afraid
