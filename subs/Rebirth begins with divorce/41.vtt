00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:01.266
What else could he do?

2
00:00:01.466 --> 00:00:02.866
Real estate, of course.

3
00:00:02.866 --> 00:00:04.900
Since he decided to go against his Wang family

4
00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:06.800
That must be a fight to the death with you

5
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:08.300
So cruel?

6
00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:10.466
provoke this woman

7
00:00:10.666 --> 00:00:13.800
It's really been eight lifetimes of blood mold

8
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:14.633
Warm up

9
00:00:14.966 --> 00:00:17.766
You see the great men talking in the South these days

10
00:00:17.766 --> 00:00:18.800
My dad said

11
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.666
South China Sea Party's real estate may be blocked

12
00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:25.200
Do you want to play Southern Talk?

13
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.600
Nanhai Island house prices

14
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.900
That's right, my dad said after this conversation?

15
00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.233
Reform and opening up is basically a foregone conclusion

16
00:00:32.533 --> 00:00:35.666
So the house price of Nanhai Island will increase again

17
00:00:36.266 --> 00:00:37.100
OK

18
00:00:37.666 --> 00:00:38.466
Let me stroke it.

19
00:00:38.566 --> 00:00:40.666
Go to you, wait for me, I'll stroke it

20
00:00:40.766 --> 00:00:41.566
I'm going to stroke it

21
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:42.800
I'm going to stroke it

22
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.900
How strange?

23
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.933
1992. 1992.

24
00:00:52.933 --> 00:00:54.166
Southern Epiphyllum ends

25
00:00:54.166 --> 00:00:55.800
The spring breeze of reform is blowing in all directions

26
00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.600
Rongmo Thorns began to officially take off
