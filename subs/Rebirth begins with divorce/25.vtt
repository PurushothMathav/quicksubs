1
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.100
Dad has more than ten numbers today

2
00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:11.000
Must buy

3
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.066
Ah, it's okay to buy it?

4
00:00:15.066 --> 00:00:17.466
I just don't know how much to buy.

5
00:00:19.366 --> 00:00:21.166
Then we'll buy half first.

6
00:00:21.166 --> 00:00:22.366
Mr. Ip bought 1 million

7
00:00:22.366 --> 00:00:23.533
We'll buy 50.

8
00:00:23.533 --> 00:00:25.400
This money is for our Xu family

9
00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.400
I can afford it even if I lose it all

10
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.566
Not to mention that this will not happen

11
00:00:29.566 --> 00:00:31.600
Just treat it as giving him number one

12
00:00:31.733 --> 00:00:34.500
Give him the change 500,000

13
00:00:35.866 --> 00:00:40.500
500,000, my Xu family still 150,000

14
00:00:41.066 --> 00:00:42.300
Just bet with him

15
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.766
Fellow, we would like to inquire with you.

16
00:00:46.933 --> 00:00:49.900
Do you know where to buy this stock warrant?

17
00:00:49.933 --> 00:00:52.266
Stock warrants

18
00:00:52.266 --> 00:00:54.266
That thing is a lie

19
00:00:55.333 --> 00:00:56.300
Why is that?

20
00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:57.666
Not a lie

21
00:00:57.666 --> 00:00:59.966
30 yuan each and a lottery

22
00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.000
Isn't that lottery?

23
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.866
And this year, more than a dozen shares will be issued.

24
00:01:04.866 --> 00:01:06.100
You said how many people can shake it?

25
00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:06.800
It can't be shaken.

26
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.266
Isn't this 30 yuan a quilt?

27
00:01:09.333 --> 00:01:10.200
Do you understand?

28
00:01:12.666 --> 00:01:16.000
Why don't you understand, young man?

29
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.600
Do you have to waste the money at home?

30
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.766
So if you want to go, go there?

31
00:01:20.766 --> 00:01:23.000
Anyway, good people can't persuade damn ghosts

32
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.400
Thank you fellow, thank you fellow

33
00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.400
Fellow, if you believe me

34
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.866
You can come with me and make a fortune on this

35
00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.666
You're still rich. I see your brain is making your mouth bubble
