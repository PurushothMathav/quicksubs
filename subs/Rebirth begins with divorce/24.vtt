00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:01.400
I have a hunch

2
00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:03.833
It's up to you to believe it or not.

3
00:00:06.966 --> 00:00:07.600
Mr. Ye?

4
00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:08.500
You see

5
00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:11.266
If we want to follow, it's definitely not a decimal sum

6
00:00:12.333 --> 00:00:13.200
How about this?

7
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.100
Anyway, it's still early for this opening date.

8
00:00:16.566 --> 00:00:19.566
Uh, let me think about it

9
00:00:19.733 --> 00:00:21.433
It should be

10
00:00:21.866 --> 00:00:23.833
I still have something to do at the company today.

11
00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:25.966
Why don't I go first?

12
00:00:25.966 --> 00:00:27.166
Sir, I'll take you

13
00:00:27.166 --> 00:00:28.500
Don't say it, don't say it, don't say it

14
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.166
Boy, this is 1 million

15
00:00:34.533 --> 00:00:37.033
Do you really want to buy stocks, Dad?

16
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.500
This opportunity to make money is missed one less

17
00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:40.666
Don't worry.

18
00:00:40.666 --> 00:00:41.400
No problem.

19
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.700
So much money in case there is any problem

20
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:46.600
I don't care.

21
00:00:46.666 --> 00:00:48.900
You should at least keep the marriage money with Xuemei

22
00:00:48.933 --> 00:00:51.366
If Xiaoxue follows you, we can't treat her badly.

23
00:00:52.333 --> 00:00:53.900
Say I don't care

24
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.566
You don't care. That's your business.

25
00:00:55.566 --> 00:00:57.200
Our Ye family can't give it away

26
00:00:57.333 --> 00:00:59.166
Dad, why don't you do this?

27
00:00:59.333 --> 00:01:01.100
I put 20,000 home

28
00:01:02.066 --> 00:01:05.266
What else do you want? Walk into the house

29
00:01:08.066 --> 00:01:10.033
What? Something happened to my son?

30
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.000
Mom, what's wrong with brother?

31
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:13.500
Your brother?

32
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.333
Today, I'm going to settle accounts with that trash surnamed Ye

33
00:01:15.333 --> 00:01:16.966
He called someone to take him in

34
00:01:16.966 --> 00:01:18.166
What should I do then?

35
00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:19.933
The caller said

36
00:01:19.933 --> 00:01:22.400
The guy who caught your brother has a lot of background

37
00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.766
Now I want to save him

38
00:01:24.766 --> 00:01:27.166
I can only go to the young master Wang introduced by an uncle

39
00:01:27.166 --> 00:01:29.866
Mom, don't you know who Wang Kun is?

40
00:01:29.866 --> 00:01:30.800
You asked me to beg him

41
00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.800
I'm not going to beg him.

42
00:01:33.066 --> 00:01:35.833
Do you want your brother to squat in it for the rest of his life?

43
00:01:36.733 --> 00:01:39.166
What's more, you sleep with Wang Shao

44
00:01:39.166 --> 00:01:41.766
No better than sleeping with that trash named Ye

45
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.433
At least you can have whatever you want

46
00:01:45.566 --> 00:01:48.100
Mom had this choice when she was young

47
00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:49.466
Gone long ago

48
00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.000
Fine. I'll do it.
