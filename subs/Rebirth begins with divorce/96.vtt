00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:01.000
Wang Kun's father

2
00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:01.800
Totally crazy

3
00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.866
Are you looking for people all over the world to sit you down?

4
00:00:05.066 --> 00:00:07.166
This old man is not giving up yet

5
00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:10.200
Mr. Ye, I will find you now.

6
00:00:10.333 --> 00:00:12.300
Let Liu Yuandai arrest this wife to death

7
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:13.400
See what else he does

8
00:00:14.666 --> 00:00:16.966
It's useless for you to go to the Sixth Hospital now.

9
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.166
No evidence.

10
00:00:18.166 --> 00:00:20.666
Even if what he says is true

11
00:00:20.666 --> 00:00:22.166
Take it as if there is no way

12
00:00:23.566 --> 00:00:24.766
Not to mention

13
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.133
This news is not necessarily true

14
00:00:28.133 --> 00:00:31.166
Ye Nan, I swear to God, is it still not okay?

15
00:00:31.166 --> 00:00:33.633
I heard with my own ears what I told your dad

16
00:00:33.766 --> 00:00:35.766
If your news is true

17
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.400
I will naturally thank you.

18
00:00:38.466 --> 00:00:39.766
That's more like it.

19
00:00:40.766 --> 00:00:41.700
Gone

20
00:00:45.766 --> 00:00:46.566
Mr. Li

21
00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.033
Don't you believe it?

22
00:00:49.066 --> 00:00:51.166
What if they're lying?

23
00:00:51.466 --> 00:00:52.566
It's not that I don't believe

24
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:54.100
but

25
00:00:54.933 --> 00:00:57.033
Might as well take it away

26
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:01.900
Wait a minute.
