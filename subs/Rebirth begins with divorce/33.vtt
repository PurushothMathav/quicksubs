00:00:00.533 --> 00:00:02.266
How much has it gone up?

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.066
So many 3,000 sets

3
00:00:05.066 --> 00:00:06.200
Now 40,000

4
00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:07.866
That's 13 times more.

5
00:00:07.866 --> 00:00:09.066
So much up

6
00:00:09.066 --> 00:00:11.033
It's not profitable, right?

7
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:12.400
Hey

8
00:00:12.866 --> 00:00:14.700
Uncle Ye, please don't forget it.

9
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.733
I have done the math for you, Mr. Ye.

10
00:00:16.733 --> 00:00:18.533
Bought a total of 1.05 million

11
00:00:18.533 --> 00:00:20.100
A total of 350 sets

12
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.833
Now it sells for 14 million.

13
00:00:22.866 --> 00:00:24.000
Remove principal

14
00:00:24.066 --> 00:00:26.266
Pure profit of 12.95 million

15
00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:31.300
2.95 million if I hadn't seen someone say it with my own eyes?

16
00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:32.866
I also find it incredible

17
00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:34.566
Hey, Mr. Ye?

18
00:00:34.566 --> 00:00:38.133
Next time, I will definitely follow you to buy more. It's okay.

19
00:00:38.133 --> 00:00:39.500
500,000 a lot

20
00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:40.800
What to say next time?

21
00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.800
My day by day

22
00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:44.600
Mr. Ye

23
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.800
Now someone has given 40,000

24
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.600
If you don't sell it, you'll have to draw the number.

25
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.566
Shall we sell it now? blah blah blah blah

26
00:00:50.866 --> 00:00:52.800
You say I'll stroke it?

27
00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:55.966
Ye Fan, look

28
00:00:55.966 --> 00:00:58.233
What the hell is this' 92 stock subscription certificate?

29
00:00:58.333 --> 00:01:00.333
Now it has actually increased by a full 1,000 times

30
00:01:00.333 --> 00:01:01.600
You said if we had bought it

31
00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.866
Is it at least a 10,000 yuan product now?

32
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:05.666
Hahaha

33
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.500
Ten times is a lot.

34
00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.000
But it's still a long way from thousands of times

35
00:01:13.566 --> 00:01:16.800
Why did 3 times go up so much?

36
00:01:17.666 --> 00:01:18.833
Oh, I see.

37
00:01:19.666 --> 00:01:21.200
There will be more and more stocks in the future

38
00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.666
And that's all there is to it.

39
00:01:22.666 --> 00:01:24.100
Prices are going up.

40
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:25.700
Don't sell

41
00:01:26.766 --> 00:01:28.833
Chief, don't sell this thing

42
00:01:29.166 --> 00:01:30.266
The price behind

43
00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:32.633
Will only be higher

44
00:01:33.866 --> 00:01:34.900
How much higher?

45
00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.500
A thousand times.
