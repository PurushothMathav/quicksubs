00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:03.466
What do you mean, actor Sun?

2
00:00:03.466 --> 00:00:04.900
What do I mean?

3
00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:07.500
Welcome, didn't your brother make it clear to you?

4
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.500
I'm not getting married

5
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:12.200
Ok you man

6
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:13.433
What's your attitude?

7
00:00:13.533 --> 00:00:15.300
For a few open-door red envelopes.

8
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:16.766
Do you still want to regret your marriage?

9
00:00:16.766 --> 00:00:19.766
A few open-door red envelopes, you are talking about intimacy.

10
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.000
Come on, come on out folks

11
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.766
You let the villagers judge you

12
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.833
Who opens the door and the red envelope costs so much 8,8008,800?

13
00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.666
You do a MAU only 1808,800

14
00:00:31.666 --> 00:00:33.500
I have to save for four or five years to save enough.

15
00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.000
The Wang family really dares to take this

16
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.266
What do you know?

17
00:00:36.333 --> 00:00:38.533
The Wang boy who opened the shovel next door also opened the shovel.

18
00:00:38.533 --> 00:00:39.666
Our cloud

19
00:00:39.666 --> 00:00:41.700
If it weren't for this dead girl begging

20
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.200
How could I possibly agree?

21
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.566
Marry my daughter to that poor man

22
00:00:44.566 --> 00:00:46.266
Kid surnamed Ye

23
00:00:46.333 --> 00:00:47.866
I'll ask you again.

24
00:00:48.166 --> 00:00:50.066
Can we get married or not?

25
00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:55.266
Don't let your breath leak, it's a big life event

26
00:00:55.266 --> 00:00:56.900
You mustn't be impulsive.

27
00:00:57.066 --> 00:00:58.066
I'm not impulsive

28
00:00:58.933 --> 00:01:02.200
I said it's okay

29
00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:06.800
Very good, the surname Ye, remember it for me.

30
00:01:07.566 --> 00:01:09.266
Don't regret it.

31
00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:10.766
Okay, what a belief!

32
00:01:10.766 --> 00:01:14.700
If you have the guts, then get out of here

33
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.300
I'm here to take a look.

34
00:01:16.533 --> 00:01:18.466
How do you go back and explain to your father?

35
00:01:18.666 --> 00:01:21.966
Then don't bother you, let's go
