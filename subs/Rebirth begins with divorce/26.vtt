00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:02.300
Big Joe Big Joe

2
00:00:02.666 --> 00:00:04.766
Ok you you prodigal man

3
00:00:04.766 --> 00:00:05.966
I finally saved so much money

4
00:00:05.966 --> 00:00:07.300
Because what are you not good at learning?

5
00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:08.266
Tianxue Motherland

6
00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:09.600
You know what?

7
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:11.933
It's not you. It's not gambling. What is it?

8
00:00:11.933 --> 00:00:13.133
I've heard it all

9
00:00:13.133 --> 00:00:15.500
This thing will kill you in one fell swoop.

10
00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:17.766
You calm down what you

11
00:00:17.766 --> 00:00:18.800
Have you thought about it?

12
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.100
If you can pass, if you can't come to me again, you can leave.

13
00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.333
Okay, don't regret not changing it by then.

14
00:00:24.333 --> 00:00:26.100
Let's go

15
00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.266
Thick appearance

16
00:00:37.266 --> 00:00:39.800
Saying this is a teacher who gets rich

17
00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:42.966
No one bought it

18
00:00:44.733 --> 00:00:45.833
Pretty.

19
00:00:46.066 --> 00:00:48.966
This gentleman must be here to buy a shopping permit.

20
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:51.633
Ah hello

21
00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:54.266
You are a staff member here.

22
00:00:54.366 --> 00:00:55.133
My name is Li Xin.

23
00:00:55.133 --> 00:00:56.466
It's the sales manager here.

24
00:00:56.466 --> 00:00:58.066
If you want to buy labor

25
00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:01.300
Manager

26
00:01:02.466 --> 00:01:03.700
Chinese New Year is to make money

27
00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.533
Who asked you to sell these broken cars to him?

28
00:01:05.533 --> 00:01:06.666
3,000 yuan

29
00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:07.700
I can't do it for three days

30
00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.266
This money is exchanged for a meal of waste paper by you.

31
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.866
What are you kneeling for me

32
00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:14.933
But you have already bought it.

33
00:01:14.933 --> 00:01:17.766
I bought it, I told you not to sell it to me today.

34
00:01:17.766 --> 00:01:19.266
I will catch you even if I die

35
00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.800
I'm the big brother. This big brother has something to say

36
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.600
So your certificate

37
00:01:24.966 --> 00:01:26.033
I got it.

38
00:01:26.666 --> 00:01:27.966
And you got it?
