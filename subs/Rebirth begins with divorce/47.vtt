00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.433
Not Mr. Ye

2
00:00:01.566 --> 00:00:03.266
Don't you own real estate?

3
00:00:03.266 --> 00:00:04.666
I still want you to buy a house.

4
00:00:04.666 --> 00:00:05.766
It's not a conflict.

5
00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:06.766
Stay

6
00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.533
Okay, that's a scratch.

7
00:00:09.533 --> 00:00:10.600
There is a nice property

8
00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:11.566
All villas

9
00:00:11.566 --> 00:00:12.300
And ah!

10
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.733
I still hired several foreign designers.

11
00:00:14.733 --> 00:00:16.400
Well-designed

12
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.800
Are they all sold to rich people like you?

13
00:00:18.966 --> 00:00:19.866
What are you waiting for?

14
00:00:19.866 --> 00:00:21.200
Go for a walk and get some money

15
00:00:22.166 --> 00:00:23.000
OK

16
00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:31.066
Mr. Ye, this is it

17
00:00:32.533 --> 00:00:33.400
Ye Fan

18
00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:37.900
You are Chen Xiao

19
00:00:38.133 --> 00:00:39.000
Me.

20
00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.700
Why are you here?

21
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.366
My friend said this house is nice

22
00:00:43.366 --> 00:00:44.333
Come and see

23
00:00:44.333 --> 00:00:46.300
Ye Fan, what did you just say?

24
00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.266
Are you here to see the house?

25
00:00:50.266 --> 00:00:53.933
Ye Fan didn't expect to see you for a few years without changing your appearance

26
00:00:53.933 --> 00:00:56.366
Is this bragging ability? That's gone up a lot

27
00:00:56.366 --> 00:00:57.800
You know our house

28
00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.933
How much is the cheapest one?

29
00:00:59.933 --> 00:01:01.133
Don't you know yet?

30
00:01:01.133 --> 00:01:02.166
I'll tell you what.

31
00:01:02.166 --> 00:01:03.400
Our house

32
00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:05.666
The cheapest one 600,000

33
00:01:06.133 --> 00:01:08.800
600,000 do you know what the concept is?

34
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.200
On your terms

35
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.400
You can't make that much money in a lifetime

36
00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:14.666
How do you speak?

37
00:01:14.666 --> 00:01:16.666
How do you know that Mr. Ye has no money?

38
00:01:16.933 --> 00:01:18.266
Mr. Hanye

39
00:01:18.666 --> 00:01:20.933
I don't know how many taels he weighs

40
00:01:20.933 --> 00:01:23.133
If he, Ye Fan, could come up with so much money

41
00:01:23.133 --> 00:01:25.566
I'll kneel and kowtow to him now and apologize
