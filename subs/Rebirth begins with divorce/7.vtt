00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.833
Will you marry me?

2
00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:03.000
Ah!

3
00:00:03.333 --> 00:00:05.866
Haha, I promise you.

4
00:00:05.933 --> 00:00:08.300
Good handsome

5
00:00:08.466 --> 00:00:09.366
Don't worry.

6
00:00:09.366 --> 00:00:11.300
I, Ye Fan, will never live up to you in my life

7
00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:12.600
If there is a violation

8
00:00:13.366 --> 00:00:14.200
Lu Wuquan Corpse

9
00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:17.266
What do you say on a happy day?

10
00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.366
Then today we will get married and be engaged.

11
00:00:21.466 --> 00:00:22.500
Everyone hurry up and eat

12
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:23.900
Don't get cold for a while

13
00:00:24.166 --> 00:00:25.366
Eat well and drink well

14
00:00:25.366 --> 00:00:28.266
Okay, everyone has seen my girl.

15
00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:29.200
Old man

16
00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:32.466
Now take the girl back

17
00:00:32.466 --> 00:00:35.300
Besides, I'll send you to eat slowly, eat slowly

18
00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:36.300
Don't rush to eat

19
00:00:38.666 --> 00:00:40.166
Xiaofan, come with me into the house

20
00:00:40.166 --> 00:00:41.566
I have something to tell you

21
00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:45.400
Wow

22
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.900
Are you really ready to marry Cher?

23
00:00:50.333 --> 00:00:51.133
Dad?

24
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.633
Can I still be at risk if I say it in public?

25
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.633
Did Uncle Jiang tell you just now?

26
00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:59.166
The prince's words symbolize beauty

27
00:00:59.333 --> 00:01:01.366
But Yang Changchang next door

28
00:01:01.366 --> 00:01:03.566
The bride price is already better than the three halls and one profit.

29
00:01:03.566 --> 00:01:05.700
Our family

30
00:01:06.966 --> 00:01:09.233
Dad, don't worry

31
00:01:09.366 --> 00:01:11.500
Leave the money to me

32
00:01:12.166 --> 00:01:13.500
Cher treated me so well

33
00:01:13.566 --> 00:01:15.466
I have lost, and no one can lose him.

34
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.700
Don't worry, it's definitely not that bad.

35
00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:21.500
Don't brag

36
00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.366
Director Yang is the richest man in Ten Rivers and Eight Miles

37
00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.233
Your son has his own way

38
00:01:27.733 --> 00:01:28.666
You wait for me.

39
00:01:28.866 --> 00:01:31.000
Son, just get the money back for you.
