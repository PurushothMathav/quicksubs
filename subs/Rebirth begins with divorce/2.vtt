00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:01.200
You want to eat shit

2
00:00:01.333 --> 00:00:02.966
I give them wedding money

3
00:00:05.933 --> 00:00:07.166
That's my wish.

4
00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:14.700
Little brother, what are you talking about, aren't you?

5
00:00:17.333 --> 00:00:18.966
Not a child, a child.

6
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.866
It's so good to see you.

7
00:00:21.733 --> 00:00:23.033
How are you

8
00:00:24.266 --> 00:00:25.233
No, nothing.

9
00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.233
Just had a long, long dream

10
00:00:28.466 --> 00:00:30.333
It feels like I haven't woken up yet

11
00:00:30.333 --> 00:00:32.933
Brother Ye Fan, the locomotive is coming soon

12
00:00:32.933 --> 00:00:35.266
We should pick up the Redskins. Pick him up

13
00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.500
I said I want our cloud to go down

14
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.866
Bring ten 888 red envelopes and go down immediately.

15
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.500
Mom, I'm here to get married

16
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.533
I've taken out all the family in the house

17
00:00:45.533 --> 00:00:47.000
Where can I find this 8,800?

18
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.833
Really?

19
00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.800
But how can I remember that you don't have a house at home yet?

20
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.500
Mom, you are my dad's pension. Why?

21
00:00:54.066 --> 00:00:55.866
I can't bear to not marry my sister.

22
00:00:56.333 --> 00:00:58.100
Wife, let me ask you about your shortcomings?

23
00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:59.733
If I bite in the future, I will definitely make up for you.

24
00:00:59.733 --> 00:01:02.066
Who knows what you will look like in the future

25
00:01:02.066 --> 00:01:04.866
Ye Fan, what about my mother? It's not easy to give birth to me and raise me

26
00:01:04.866 --> 00:01:07.500
If you really want to marry me, agree to his terms

27
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.666
But I, Brother Yifan, don't worry.

28
00:01:09.666 --> 00:01:11.200
My parents left me a fortune when they died

29
00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.766
I'll take it for you now.

30
00:01:15.566 --> 00:01:17.266
In my last life, I ate the loss of this woman

31
00:01:17.266 --> 00:01:18.666
Many families were destroyed

32
00:01:19.066 --> 00:01:20.100
continuously

33
00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.866
Xiaoyanzi hasn't collected the money yet

34
00:01:23.066 --> 00:01:24.366
What time is it?

35
00:01:24.366 --> 00:01:26.300
Do you not want to get married?

36
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.500
Hahaha

37
00:01:28.266 --> 00:01:29.500
I guess you're right.

38
00:01:29.666 --> 00:01:33.900
This marriage, I just don't want to get married
