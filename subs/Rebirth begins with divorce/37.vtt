1
00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:04.033
What do you still want to exist? Something happened.

2
00:00:06.766 --> 00:00:07.566
Wang Shao

3
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:09.700
What's the matter? Leave me alone.

4
00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:13.033
They're all dead on a two-month project

5
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.033
It was robbed by someone else

6
00:00:21.733 --> 00:00:24.766
Feed the black dog and find out about Lao Tzu

7
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.766
Who the hell took the land in Haijiang Village?

8
00:00:27.766 --> 00:00:30.766
Get some dirt on Tai Sui's head and wipe it for me

9
00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:36.300
Cooperation is no problem

10
00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.766
There are 132 households in total

11
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.266
That's 9.24 million

12
00:00:41.366 --> 00:00:43.300
Well, it will probably arrive in our village at night.

13
00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:44.100
on the account

14
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.466
At that time, just remember to check it for the village chief.

15
00:00:46.533 --> 00:00:48.966
Ah no no no

16
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.433
Have a lunch together

17
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:52.466
No no

18
00:00:52.466 --> 00:00:53.900
We have something to do tonight

19
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:55.533
Let's go first.

20
00:00:55.533 --> 00:00:58.066
Hey, okay, okay, next time?

21
00:00:59.066 --> 00:00:59.900
Mr. Ye

22
00:01:00.733 --> 00:01:03.466
What's the matter? You spent so much money on this land.

23
00:01:03.466 --> 00:01:05.066
Just to target the Wang family

24
00:01:05.066 --> 00:01:06.733
Is it too uneconomical?

25
00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:09.666
Who told you that I was just targeting the Wang family?

26
00:01:10.266 --> 00:01:11.066
Isn't it?

27
00:01:11.066 --> 00:01:12.800
Of course not.

28
00:01:12.933 --> 00:01:14.266
If nothing else

29
00:01:14.266 --> 00:01:15.500
Just this land

30
00:01:16.166 --> 00:01:18.633
It should rise by 200 in less than a month.

31
00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:20.400
One month.
