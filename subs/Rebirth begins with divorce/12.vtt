00:00:00.666 --> 00:00:02.433
Hey, it's not for sale.

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.500
Damn trash, give me back this money

3
00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:08.200
I'll have someone give you your dowry later.

4
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:09.566
Excuse me?

5
00:00:09.666 --> 00:00:11.266
Money and goods together

6
00:00:11.866 --> 00:00:15.166
I will pay attention to this barren mountain now

7
00:00:15.733 --> 00:00:16.533
Industrial

8
00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:18.566
Did you already know

9
00:00:18.566 --> 00:00:19.900
Someone wants a high price for this

10
00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:21.200
The mountains are barren

11
00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.766
There are really people willing to tell you the export price, Dad.

12
00:00:25.166 --> 00:00:27.066
Although this barren mountain can't grow anything

13
00:00:27.066 --> 00:00:28.333
But the location is good.

14
00:00:28.333 --> 00:00:30.366
It's normal for people to be willing to buy it at a high price

15
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:34.600
Damn you

16
00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.066
Are you scheming against me?

17
00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:37.400
Believe it or not, I will beat you to death.

18
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:38.833
You've figured it out

19
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.000
This is my house.

20
00:00:41.466 --> 00:00:42.900
If you touch me

21
00:00:43.066 --> 00:00:44.866
You can't get out of this hospital.

22
00:00:46.366 --> 00:00:48.433
Do you want to die?

23
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:50.400
Stop

24
00:00:50.933 --> 00:00:52.266
What are we doing?

25
00:00:52.533 --> 00:00:53.333
village chief

26
00:00:53.466 --> 00:00:56.500
Did you hear about your coming this morning?

27
00:00:56.733 --> 00:00:57.900
This family

28
00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.000
There will be a temporary dowry in the morning.

29
00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.066
He quit the wedding in the afternoon and refused to refund our bride price.

30
00:01:02.266 --> 00:01:03.600
I can't help it either.

31
00:01:03.733 --> 00:01:04.933
Take their barren mountain

32
00:01:04.933 --> 00:01:06.066
Changed our dowry

33
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:07.600
That's great.

34
00:01:07.666 --> 00:01:10.600
Now someone is willing to pay a high price for this barren mountain

35
00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.466
Just wanted to exchange it for their emperor

36
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.166
Do you think there is such a shameless person in this world?

37
00:01:16.166 --> 00:01:17.800
You you what you

38
00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:19.100
Isn't it?

39
00:01:19.166 --> 00:01:22.600
Village Chief, this is a treaty, have you passed it?
