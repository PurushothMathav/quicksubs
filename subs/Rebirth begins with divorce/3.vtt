00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.400
Ye Fan, am I crazy?

2
00:00:02.466 --> 00:00:04.166
Do you know what you're talking about?

3
00:00:04.366 --> 00:00:07.133
Yes, Brother Ye Fan, don't talk nonsense here

4
00:00:07.133 --> 00:00:08.933
You paid so much to marry Sister Ying

5
00:00:08.933 --> 00:00:10.900
How can you say you won't end it if you don't end it?

6
00:00:11.066 --> 00:00:13.833
But you paid more for me, Cher.

7
00:00:14.533 --> 00:00:16.566
If you want to marry me, you should marry you

8
00:00:18.266 --> 00:00:20.266
Ok Ye Fan

9
00:00:20.733 --> 00:00:22.300
I said what's wrong with you

10
00:00:22.733 --> 00:00:25.300
It turned out that he had already hooked up with this cheap hoof, right?

11
00:00:25.666 --> 00:00:27.666
Ok you two wait for me

12
00:00:27.766 --> 00:00:28.900
I'm going to my sister

13
00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:31.800
Brother Yifan, what are you doing?

14
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.200
Nothing. Just a thought.

15
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.866
Their family wants ten 888 red envelopes.

16
00:00:37.866 --> 00:00:39.566
Suddenly I don't want to get married

17
00:00:39.566 --> 00:00:43.000
Brother Ye Fan, if you have no money, I still have it

18
00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.533
I'll take it to you in a while, silly girl.

19
00:00:45.533 --> 00:00:47.900
That's the last dowry your parents left you?

20
00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:49.400
How can I take it without

21
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:50.200
But

22
00:00:50.933 --> 00:00:53.566
In my last life, I was even more sorry for you

23
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.400
Start over in this life

24
00:00:56.933 --> 00:00:57.733
Cher

25
00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.000
I will never let it happen to you again

26
00:01:01.066 --> 00:01:03.466
Brother Ye Fan, what are you talking about?

27
00:01:06.066 --> 00:01:08.300
Sun Yanzi, what do you mean?
