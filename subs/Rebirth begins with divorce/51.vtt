00:00:01.066 --> 00:00:02.766
Mr. Ye, take your time

2
00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:05.800
I will immediately arrange to run the street to tidy up that building.

3
00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:07.233
You will be able to move in soon.

4
00:00:07.266 --> 00:00:09.066
Okay, that's troublesome.

5
00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:10.833
Brother, you are busy first.

6
00:00:12.566 --> 00:00:14.000
Hey, Mr. Ye

7
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:16.466
Do you need anything next?

8
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.966
I think if it's ok

9
00:00:20.166 --> 00:00:21.133
Get me a driver's license

10
00:00:21.133 --> 00:00:22.166
Make another trolley

11
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.333
Otherwise, I will have to find you every time I go out.

12
00:00:24.333 --> 00:00:25.566
How troublesome

13
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.666
Uh, driver's license and car everywhere

14
00:00:27.933 --> 00:00:30.566
Can you drive?

15
00:00:31.533 --> 00:00:32.966
Who do you look down on?

16
00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:34.466
Let me tell you something.

17
00:00:34.466 --> 00:00:37.366
I am the little car god called Qiumingshan

18
00:00:38.966 --> 00:00:39.766
Ouch stone

19
00:00:40.933 --> 00:00:41.966
I'll show you

20
00:00:41.966 --> 00:00:44.400
I'll try it.

21
00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.800
Wang Shao, you let that kid have news.

22
00:00:52.866 --> 00:00:54.033
Where is it?

23
00:00:54.266 --> 00:00:57.266
The specifics will be observed for a while.

24
00:00:57.266 --> 00:01:00.866
Let me know as soon as you know where he is

25
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.066
Dear, is that Xinyan kid?

26
00:01:07.066 --> 00:01:10.166
That's right, your useless fiancÃ©

27
00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.700
Didn't your brother always want revenge on him?

28
00:01:12.866 --> 00:01:15.766
Here's your chance. Okay.

29
00:01:16.133 --> 00:01:18.000
I'll call him right now.
