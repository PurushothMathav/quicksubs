00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:03.000
Brother, who the hell is your brother?

2
00:00:17.666 --> 00:00:18.800
I said this kid is unreliable

3
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.866
What if you don't believe me?

4
00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:21.866
What are you still doing?

5
00:00:21.866 --> 00:00:22.466
That's enough money.

6
00:00:22.466 --> 00:00:23.266
Took a while

7
00:00:23.266 --> 00:00:24.500
Who wins faster?

8
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:25.800
Stop

9
00:00:26.766 --> 00:00:28.100
Hahaha

10
00:00:31.266 --> 00:00:32.900
Captain, don't run

11
00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:34.366
Stop and don't run

12
00:00:35.366 --> 00:00:36.166
Don't run

13
00:00:36.966 --> 00:00:39.266
280,000 dollars. That's a lot of money

14
00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:40.666
If this allows you to catch up

15
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.766
Then you must not kill

16
00:00:45.333 --> 00:00:47.366
Ok, go down right now

17
00:00:47.733 --> 00:00:48.666
Forget it. Forget it.

18
00:00:48.733 --> 00:00:49.866
The money is gone, you can make it again.

19
00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:51.700
Hold on to your life first

20
00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:59.066
What to do, bro?

21
00:00:59.266 --> 00:01:01.166
Forget it, lose the money

22
00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:02.666
I guess there's really no money left.

23
00:01:02.666 --> 00:01:05.166
Take the money and go big, you go chic

24
00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:07.300
Go go go

25
00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:10.900
Uh-huh.

26
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.766
A bucket of money I finally made

27
00:01:15.133 --> 00:01:16.600
Just figure it out

28
00:01:18.166 --> 00:01:19.666
Bank brother, you go to work

29
00:01:20.866 --> 00:01:21.666
Thank you, sir.

30
00:01:21.766 --> 00:01:23.000
I heard you're in trouble.
