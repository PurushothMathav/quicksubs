1
00:00:01.133 --> 00:00:03.800
Doctor, what's the matter with my grandfather?

2
00:00:04.066 --> 00:00:05.700
Judging from the checklist

3
00:00:05.866 --> 00:00:07.733
Your grandfather must have leukemia

4
00:00:07.733 --> 00:00:10.866
Leukemia is blood cancer in the general population

5
00:00:10.866 --> 00:00:13.200
I remember there should be a cure for this blood cancer

6
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:13.866
Exactly.

7
00:00:13.866 --> 00:00:15.966
Mr. Jiang, this is the better one

8
00:00:15.966 --> 00:00:18.100
Although the species cannot be cured by this

9
00:00:18.266 --> 00:00:19.466
But as long as there is money

10
00:00:19.466 --> 00:00:21.366
It shouldn't be a problem to live for more than ten years

11
00:00:21.366 --> 00:00:23.133
How much will that cost?

12
00:00:23.133 --> 00:00:25.933
It is estimated that it will be at least 200,000 to 300,000

13
00:00:25.933 --> 00:00:27.400
300,000 so much

14
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.766
Then I'll go now, I can't go

15
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.966
Let's go with grandpa

16
00:00:33.966 --> 00:00:34.900
Grandpa

17
00:00:35.733 --> 00:00:39.266
Your money was saved for you by your parents

18
00:00:39.366 --> 00:00:41.700
Dad, you won't spend it even if you have money.

19
00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.766
Do you want grandpa to die by himself?

20
00:00:45.066 --> 00:00:46.833
Go back with grandpa
