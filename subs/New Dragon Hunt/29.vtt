00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:01.166
nonsense

2
00:00:01.766 --> 00:00:04.833
You once told me you'd rather blood three feet on the ground

3
00:00:05.066 --> 00:00:07.500
Don't teach men to chase the world

4
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:08.300
Did you know

5
00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:11.266
That's what's kept me going.

6
00:00:11.266 --> 00:00:12.666
Achieved the name of murder

7
00:00:12.666 --> 00:00:14.100
You're too naive.

8
00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:16.100
In this real world

9
00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:18.100
What could be worth a human life?

10
00:00:18.166 --> 00:00:20.066
First ring, hurry up and kneel down

11
00:00:20.066 --> 00:00:22.500
What you're doing now is dirty enough.

12
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:23.900
matchmaker

13
00:00:24.866 --> 00:00:26.100
I did it wrong.

14
00:00:27.333 --> 00:00:28.666
Let you be wronged

15
00:00:28.666 --> 00:00:31.066
Oh, that's infatuation.

16
00:00:31.066 --> 00:00:35.400
The most beautiful woman in southern Xinjiang actually bowed her head for you

17
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:36.633
Hahahaha

18
00:00:36.966 --> 00:00:38.266
Can see this scene

19
00:00:38.366 --> 00:00:42.566
What a surprise, hahahaha.

20
00:00:42.933 --> 00:00:43.833
Han Cosmos

21
00:00:44.533 --> 00:00:46.500
I will definitely make your life worse than death

22
00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.666
Okay, okay, the Supreme is weak

23
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.200
Before the five supremes came

24
00:00:53.333 --> 00:00:54.266
We are sure

25
00:00:54.266 --> 00:00:55.800
But now

26
00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.166
You're just a lost dog

27
00:00:58.166 --> 00:01:00.933
What right do you have to talk nonsense here?

28
00:01:00.933 --> 00:01:02.300
Who gave you the courage?

29
00:01:02.566 --> 00:01:04.400
Hongyan, do you believe me?

30
00:01:04.666 --> 00:01:07.066
All of you add up to me.

31
00:01:07.133 --> 00:01:08.500
Just a clown jumping beams

32
00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:09.800
You think I'm really stupid?

33
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.633
Do you think I would die in vain?

34
00:01:13.333 --> 00:01:15.466
Ye Huan, is what you said true?

35
00:01:15.466 --> 00:01:17.166
I'll prove it to you now

36
00:01:21.366 --> 00:01:22.266
Ye Huan

37
00:01:25.533 --> 00:01:27.100
Don't bother.

38
00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:29.266
In prison

39
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.433
Weighing 37,000 troops

40
00:01:31.933 --> 00:01:35.866
Only I and other five supremes have joined forces to open a stalemate

41
00:01:35.933 --> 00:01:38.266
Prisoners who enter this prison

42
00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.000
He never walked out alone.

43
00:01:41.866 --> 00:01:42.666
beautiful

44
00:01:48.166 --> 00:01:49.566
One-handed ancestral name

45
00:01:49.966 --> 00:01:50.866
Golden Curse

46
00:01:51.566 --> 00:01:52.366
Night Call

47
00:01:53.133 --> 00:01:54.433
He woke up for three minutes

48
00:01:55.366 --> 00:01:56.466
Proud to be evil

49
00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:57.566
You let go now

50
00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.466
I see for the sake of you guys making big bets

51
00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.933
I can spare your life, hahaha.

52
00:02:02.933 --> 00:02:03.733
swallow flower

53
00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.866
It seems they have recognized reality

54
00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:08.466
Ah!

55
00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:10.200
No.
