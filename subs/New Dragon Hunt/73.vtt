00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:02.166
It's priceless.

2
00:00:02.166 --> 00:00:05.466
It can make people die and be reborn.

3
00:00:08.266 --> 00:00:10.633
This is clearly an ordinary jade pendant

4
00:00:10.766 --> 00:00:12.166
No consonant fluctuations

5
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.600
Team Leader Ye is well-informed

6
00:00:15.133 --> 00:00:16.766
Can't you not even see this?

7
00:00:16.766 --> 00:00:18.466
Huh, what the hell do you know?

8
00:00:18.466 --> 00:00:21.200
This is the quality assurance beyond the three realms

9
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:22.866
How can you see

10
00:00:23.866 --> 00:00:25.800
No, you won't lie to me.

11
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.600
Leader Ye, you are dead

12
00:00:27.666 --> 00:00:29.100
You work for everybody.

13
00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:30.800
Just borrow it, by the way

14
00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:33.400
Jiang

15
00:00:34.066 --> 00:00:36.166
Jiang, you are really dead

16
00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.533
Jiang Ya

17
00:00:37.533 --> 00:00:39.000
My son

18
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.533
How miserable you died!

19
00:00:40.533 --> 00:00:43.500
Mr. Ye, it's your turn now.

20
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.000
It's time to show your Holy Master's ability

21
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.766
See if it's bragging

22
00:00:48.933 --> 00:00:51.600
Or do you really have that immortal grace?

23
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.166
No hurry, yes?

24
00:00:53.166 --> 00:00:54.100
My son is dead now.

25
00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:55.033
Do you want to default

26
00:00:55.133 --> 00:00:56.333
Before the knife in the morning

27
00:00:56.333 --> 00:00:57.966
I have a question that I think so clearly

28
00:00:57.966 --> 00:00:59.466
This jade pendant in your hand

29
00:00:59.933 --> 00:01:01.200
Who gave it to you?

30
00:01:01.266 --> 00:01:02.966
Does this have something to do with you?

31
00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.400
This is the treasure of our Ye family

32
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:07.600
Family yellow robe

33
00:01:08.066 --> 00:01:09.333
Your Ye family's family treasure

34
00:01:09.333 --> 00:01:10.333
How could it be a piece?

35
00:01:10.333 --> 00:01:12.200
A jade pendant that can't be more ordinary

36
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.000
Not to mention

37
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.066
I'm sensing a bit of disgust here.

38
00:01:15.066 --> 00:01:16.000
The smell of evil

39
00:01:17.933 --> 00:01:19.000
Where are we going?
