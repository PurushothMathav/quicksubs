1
00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:01.466
Don't want to be a punk

2
00:00:01.666 --> 00:00:02.566
This job is too dangerous

3
00:00:02.566 --> 00:00:03.666
You can't do it

4
00:00:03.766 --> 00:00:05.266
Dad, don't worry.

5
00:00:05.466 --> 00:00:06.300
I know

6
00:00:06.466 --> 00:00:07.800
Being a water ghost is dangerous

7
00:00:07.933 --> 00:00:09.400
If the balance is not careful, it will never come up again.

8
00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:10.866
But practice a layer of cultivation

9
00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:13.066
I can go to work even if the rope breaks

10
00:00:13.066 --> 00:00:14.766
This kid is really courting death

11
00:00:14.766 --> 00:00:15.566
He can go down

12
00:00:15.566 --> 00:00:18.066
My oldest niece wouldn't want to marry this guy

13
00:00:18.133 --> 00:00:20.966
If you burn it to death, the marriage will be in vain

14
00:00:20.966 --> 00:00:23.533
Pan Jia thank you, I'm too late

15
00:00:23.533 --> 00:00:25.200
As for the family heirloom

16
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:26.733
Sons are dead

17
00:00:26.733 --> 00:00:28.666
Who else can Ye Sheng pass on to?

18
00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:30.600
It's not mine yet.

19
00:00:30.966 --> 00:00:34.066
Does my son have you in his heart or does his son love you?

20
00:00:34.066 --> 00:00:36.366
It will be fine without a son

21
00:00:36.966 --> 00:00:39.200
Xiaohuan, be careful

22
00:00:43.733 --> 00:00:44.566
All right.

23
00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:46.366
Be careful!

24
00:00:58.733 --> 00:01:00.233
Little Flower Little Flower

25
00:01:10.766 --> 00:01:13.766
All die first

26
00:01:14.333 --> 00:01:15.833
No matter how old you are

27
00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:18.500
Ah rope rope

28
00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:19.600
Why did the rope break?

29
00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:20.433
How come?

30
00:01:20.766 --> 00:01:21.866
I'm back to save people

31
00:01:21.866 --> 00:01:23.266
People didn't save people

32
00:01:23.266 --> 00:01:25.000
I'm embarrassed, what's wrong?

33
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.400
Why did the rope break?

34
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.766
Snowflake Snowflake

35
00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.966
Don't scare me

36
00:01:28.966 --> 00:01:32.033
I treat you like my own son

37
00:01:32.566 --> 00:01:35.566
It's my stepmother who took care of you

38
00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:36.600
Little flower

39
00:01:37.566 --> 00:01:38.933
Xiaohua, can't you die?

40
00:01:38.933 --> 00:01:41.600
What should I do if you die, little flower?
