00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:03.500
Are wildflowers delicious?

2
00:00:03.866 --> 00:00:06.866
Not bad hahahaha

3
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:10.600
Guys, it's not that I despise people

4
00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:12.400
This kid's behavior

5
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.633
Following the high-end is Gege

6
00:00:16.566 --> 00:00:17.366
Fu Hongyan

7
00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:21.000
Isn't it embarrassing enough not to take it away quickly?

8
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.533
Scared me to death

9
00:00:22.533 --> 00:00:23.966
I thought this night was fun

10
00:00:23.966 --> 00:00:26.200
What monstrous latent handle can be used?

11
00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.666
I didn't expect it to be here

12
00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:31.800
Don't eat for a while

13
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:33.200
OK

14
00:00:33.733 --> 00:00:34.800
This is good stuff

15
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.033
Do you want one?

16
00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:37.566
I'll beg you in a while, okay?

17
00:00:37.566 --> 00:00:38.466
Don't eat any more

18
00:00:38.466 --> 00:00:40.033
Look at what the occasion is today.

19
00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.166
I said don't eat anymore

20
00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:44.600
Hongyan, trust me.

21
00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.000
When I'm done eating, I can definitely bet the audience. Is that enough?

22
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.333
Look at what you're talking about.

23
00:00:48.333 --> 00:00:49.200
If you are interesting

24
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.000
Take care of me, if anything happens to you

25
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.333
Protect your daughter from marriage

26
00:00:52.333 --> 00:00:55.100
But now you're like a skin-colored stone seat

27
00:00:55.266 --> 00:00:57.533
His family is laughing at you, can't you see it?

28
00:00:57.533 --> 00:00:58.900
I do things all my life

29
00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:00.533
Why should you care about the eyes of others?

30
00:01:00.533 --> 00:01:02.100
You don't have that strength, what are you pretending to be?

31
00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.800
I can't give it to us. Why should West Lake be selected?

32
00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.766
Our relationship is fine now

33
00:01:05.766 --> 00:01:06.700
We don't have it.

34
00:01:07.133 --> 00:01:08.666
Only gossip

35
00:01:08.666 --> 00:01:11.466
You can pay me red rice for the stone mud at night.

36
00:01:11.466 --> 00:01:13.866
But it became a big joke for boys

37
00:01:15.133 --> 00:01:17.000
People die. They fall.

38
00:01:17.066 --> 00:01:19.566
Hanging will perish, but God will not perish

39
00:01:19.566 --> 00:01:22.866
How will you mortals know my hand?
