00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.866
Don't worry about the climate.

2
00:00:03.133 --> 00:00:06.533
Sir is the most wonderful person I have found

3
00:00:06.533 --> 00:00:07.266
Me too.

4
00:00:07.266 --> 00:00:10.066
Will think that Mr. has found something

5
00:00:10.066 --> 00:00:13.066
The cat seems to be involved

6
00:00:13.133 --> 00:00:14.566
In fact, on the outside

7
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.000
The group of people who played them

8
00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:18.766
Why are you still throwing it away?

9
00:00:18.766 --> 00:00:20.800
This tea knife has been around for a long time

10
00:00:24.133 --> 00:00:26.633
Ok I bet you

11
00:00:26.966 --> 00:00:28.100
I'll go first.

12
00:00:28.766 --> 00:00:30.100
But before you gamble

13
00:00:30.766 --> 00:00:32.500
I have two conditions to say

14
00:00:32.566 --> 00:00:34.666
First of all, if I die

15
00:00:34.666 --> 00:00:36.733
Then the throne of the Lord is empty talk

16
00:00:36.733 --> 00:00:39.100
I have to get some benefits for our Ye family

17
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.933
What's the benefit?

18
00:00:39.933 --> 00:00:40.933
If I die

19
00:00:40.933 --> 00:00:43.600
Then half of the property of the ten ancient tribes

20
00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.466
It must belong to my Ye family

21
00:00:46.133 --> 00:00:48.266
Yes, after all, you are competing with me

22
00:00:48.266 --> 00:00:49.533
I don't even want my life

23
00:00:49.533 --> 00:00:50.433
Courage

24
00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:51.700
The second condition

25
00:00:52.066 --> 00:00:53.200
Give me some time.

26
00:00:53.666 --> 00:00:55.433
I'm going to see my father.

27
00:00:55.566 --> 00:00:56.766
account for the funeral

28
00:00:56.933 --> 00:00:57.866
It's ok.

29
00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:00.366
As long as you are not a shrinking turtle

30
00:01:00.366 --> 00:01:02.100
Just walk away

31
00:01:13.733 --> 00:01:15.000
Hurry up, hurry up, time is running out

32
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:15.966
Hurry up

33
00:01:15.966 --> 00:01:17.200
Master, are we going back to the imperial capital?

34
00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:18.533
Go back to the imperial capital

35
00:01:18.533 --> 00:01:20.100
Go to the private garden
