00:00:01.766 --> 00:00:02.800
What he said is true

2
00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:03.866
But I'm curious

3
00:00:03.866 --> 00:00:05.766
How do you know these things?

4
00:00:05.766 --> 00:00:06.566
Humph

5
00:00:06.733 --> 00:00:10.100
You thought you were the only one who could reverse time and space

6
00:00:10.133 --> 00:00:11.300
To tell you the truth

7
00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:13.200
Ferris will kill him soon

8
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.500
It could wipe you out in the snap of a finger.

9
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:17.400
Not to mention

10
00:00:17.533 --> 00:00:20.766
You decapitate and respawn consume a lot of stacks

11
00:00:20.766 --> 00:00:22.866
It's just an empty shell now

12
00:00:22.966 --> 00:00:24.400
Hahahaha

13
00:00:24.533 --> 00:00:26.400
Good one, please, Jun Rumeng.

14
00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.666
So this is the game you set up?

15
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.033
Wrong.

16
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.333
Not us.

17
00:00:31.333 --> 00:00:32.866
I was alone.

18
00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.100
Thank goodness for giving me an armpit once

19
00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.966
The opportunity for unification

20
00:00:37.966 --> 00:00:39.433
It's been ten days soon

21
00:00:39.533 --> 00:00:40.333
you

22
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.266
You people will be trampled under my feet

23
00:00:43.533 --> 00:00:44.833
later

24
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.766
The whole thing belongs to me

25
00:00:47.766 --> 00:00:49.866
A human heart is worse than a snake swallowing an elephant

26
00:00:49.966 --> 00:00:52.800
Is there really a demon lord in the world?

27
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.800
Isn't that a story from myths and legends?

28
00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.300
In the Three Realms of He Dongfang

29
00:00:57.966 --> 00:00:58.800
That's weird

30
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.600
You can understand it as not being in the same plane

31
00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.200
So you can't see it at all

32
00:01:03.466 --> 00:01:06.400
All monarchs or emperors get married

33
00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:07.666
Now you're done.

34
00:01:07.666 --> 00:01:09.133
You are really courting death

35
00:01:09.133 --> 00:01:11.100
Even if you were the late emperor

36
00:01:11.266 --> 00:01:12.066
So what?

37
00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:14.700
The demon lord is now chasing the door to lock your life

38
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:15.833
die at one point

39
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.966
The Demon Lord is just a defeated general under me

40
00:01:18.966 --> 00:01:21.000
If he doesn't come, he will come if he dares

41
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.266
I will also kill it.
