00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:01.900
And if you die?

2
00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:03.000
If I die

3
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.300
From now on, the position of Holy Master of Great Xia will be given to him

4
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:09.833
Leaves win hahahaha don't like it

5
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.900
You mean I don't need to go on this faucet brake?

6
00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.700
Your head is not worthy of this faucet two son you

7
00:00:17.266 --> 00:00:19.300
Ye Huan, are you stupid?

8
00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.166
You still have a chance of winning

9
00:00:21.166 --> 00:00:22.666
But now you are alone

10
00:00:22.666 --> 00:00:24.033
This is mortal

11
00:00:27.766 --> 00:00:29.566
Ah look look look

12
00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:30.700
Is there an air leak?

13
00:00:30.733 --> 00:00:32.666
I said this person is unreliable

14
00:00:32.733 --> 00:00:35.533
This Ye Huan must be scared to pee right now

15
00:00:35.533 --> 00:00:36.766
Start talking nonsense

16
00:00:36.766 --> 00:00:38.833
In the face of absolute strength

17
00:00:38.866 --> 00:00:41.100
It's not possible without deep heritage

18
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:41.700
This kid

19
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.266
He must have been scared by these ten bones

20
00:00:44.333 --> 00:00:46.400
Still here to die

21
00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:47.900
I know your cultivation is impressive

22
00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:49.066
But even so

23
00:00:49.066 --> 00:00:51.400
This head can't live at all if it moves house

24
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.233
This is not a so-called deception

25
00:00:53.366 --> 00:00:55.066
This is a real beheading.

26
00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:59.766
Someone accompanies me to be afraid of lazy people

27
00:01:09.733 --> 00:01:10.800
Telephone

28
00:01:11.766 --> 00:01:13.000
What do you mean?

29
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.733
Didn't you agree to do it yourself?

30
00:01:14.733 --> 00:01:16.866
I just said that this faucet gate belongs to me

31
00:01:16.866 --> 00:01:18.200
You come with integrity

32
00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.900
How can I make you believe in me?

33
00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.066
Have fun if you want to play

34
00:01:22.066 --> 00:01:23.566
This faucet gate is not for you

35
00:01:23.566 --> 00:01:25.533
Or are you more compatible with this dog head brake?

36
00:01:25.533 --> 00:01:26.333
Wild Soul

37
00:01:26.966 --> 00:01:28.866
You're a little too damn deceiving

38
00:01:28.866 --> 00:01:31.466
You have to humiliate and nag about even losing your head

39
00:01:31.533 --> 00:01:32.333
