00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:03.666
Dad?

2
00:00:03.666 --> 00:00:06.066
Lord Demon Lord should already know about it, right?

3
00:00:06.066 --> 00:00:07.533
He is not fooled at all this night

4
00:00:07.533 --> 00:00:08.366
Lord Demon Lord

5
00:00:08.366 --> 00:00:10.000
Please go to bed

6
00:00:10.066 --> 00:00:11.766
Can't you count my son in?

7
00:00:11.766 --> 00:00:13.266
I only have one son

8
00:00:13.266 --> 00:00:14.133
Lord Demon Lord

9
00:00:14.133 --> 00:00:15.500
Since you have already said it

10
00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.266
This leaf flower is a weak chicken

11
00:00:17.366 --> 00:00:19.133
Then why don't you do it yourself?

12
00:00:19.133 --> 00:00:20.266
As for the trouble

13
00:00:20.266 --> 00:00:22.600
It's the summer solstice

14
00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:24.333
There are a few old monster presidents

15
00:00:24.333 --> 00:00:26.566
And when the night famine breaks through the natural

16
00:00:26.566 --> 00:00:27.800
They change

17
00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.366
If I make a move

18
00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.600
They are bound to change

19
00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.100
And they will surely join forces to kill

20
00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.533
Then you mean if it's not a last resort

21
00:00:36.533 --> 00:00:37.866
You won't shoot

22
00:00:39.566 --> 00:00:40.366
Exactly.

23
00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:42.666
But I don't want to die.

24
00:00:42.666 --> 00:00:44.566
It's almost a death sentence.

25
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.100
No matter whether he dies or not

26
00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.366
It's me who is dead now, it's me

27
00:00:48.366 --> 00:00:49.566
I don't do it anyway

28
00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.033
Dad, let's go back to the land this afternoon

29
00:00:58.300 --> 00:00:59.100
presumptuous

30
00:01:00.733 --> 00:01:02.300
You dare not ask

31
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:04.866
Where am I going?

32
00:01:09.966 --> 00:01:12.866
This is uncomfortable for bathing.

33
00:01:12.866 --> 00:01:13.733
Demon quality assurance

34
00:01:13.733 --> 00:01:15.000
Even ordinary people get

35
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.633
He can also be decapitated and seriously injured

36
00:01:17.933 --> 00:01:19.533
And if you take it

37
00:01:19.533 --> 00:01:21.966
You have immortality.

38
00:01:24.933 --> 00:01:26.200
Lord Mo Jun

39
00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:27.633
This one.

40
00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.000
Is it really that deep?

41
00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.300
Then thank you, Lord Mo Jun

42
00:01:37.333 --> 00:01:39.100
Now I have a little bit in my heart

43
00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:47.200
Let's go

44
00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.333
It's just an ordinary fish match

45
00:01:58.333 --> 00:02:01.166
Mortal people are like that

46
00:02:02.466 --> 00:02:03.266
Ah!

47
00:02:04.266 --> 00:02:07.100
Hahahaha
