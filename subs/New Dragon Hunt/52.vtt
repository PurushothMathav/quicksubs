00:00:01.333 --> 00:00:02.133
Ah!

2
00:00:03.066 --> 00:00:04.000
Ha ha.

3
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:07.400
Ah!

4
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:10.600
Ahahaha

5
00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:12.766
Ah!

6
00:00:13.533 --> 00:00:16.966
Wildflower, so what if you have force?

7
00:00:16.966 --> 00:00:20.600
That hero soul, you have to have power and a background

8
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:23.200
They're right, Ben, if something happens

9
00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:24.933
You're all doomed.

10
00:00:24.933 --> 00:00:26.200
If you ask why

11
00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:27.166
Just by skill

12
00:00:27.166 --> 00:00:28.133
ID card

13
00:00:28.133 --> 00:00:32.700
This young master is the enemy of the ten ancient tribes

14
00:00:33.066 --> 00:00:35.833
I know you don't believe it, wait.

15
00:00:46.733 --> 00:00:49.066
Come on, aren't you going to touch me?

16
00:00:49.066 --> 00:00:51.800
Shoot me?

17
00:00:53.533 --> 00:00:55.666
Fight back and forth

18
00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:56.833
Boom!

19
00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:57.800
Brain shot

20
00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.500
My life is yours

21
00:01:01.933 --> 00:01:04.066
Don't push your luck.

22
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.900
Kill, shoot

23
00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.033
come

24
00:01:10.166 --> 00:01:12.200
I can't wait! Kill me!

25
00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.066
I can't do that.

26
00:01:18.133 --> 00:01:19.866
What the hell are you pretending to be?

27
00:01:19.866 --> 00:01:22.233
Take old things and rely on you

28
00:01:24.333 --> 00:01:26.066
Don't spend me telling you

29
00:01:26.066 --> 00:01:27.300
That's not a gap.

30
00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:28.533
That's what I call a gap.

31
00:01:28.533 --> 00:01:30.600
Even if I am against the whole city

32
00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.400
It's not as dangerous as me alone

33
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.500
Forget it, Brother Zhao

34
00:01:35.533 --> 00:01:37.700
Nanjing Night Huan starts now

35
00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.900
It has nothing to do with my deputy

36
00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:40.866
Betrothal gift refund

37
00:01:40.866 --> 00:01:42.900
Name withdrawn dad

38
00:01:47.733 --> 00:01:48.933
What's your name dad

39
00:01:48.933 --> 00:01:50.466
No dad, I'm here
