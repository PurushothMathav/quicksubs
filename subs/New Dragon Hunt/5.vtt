00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:01.766
This contract cannot be signed

2
00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:05.100
Ye Huan, what are you up to?

3
00:00:05.133 --> 00:00:06.666
You are just an ordinary employee

4
00:00:06.666 --> 00:00:08.300
Even if you are my fiancÃ©

5
00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:11.300
It's not like you can call me today

6
00:00:11.766 --> 00:00:13.600
Hongyan is great

7
00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:16.200
I thought I would never see you again in my life

8
00:00:17.933 --> 00:00:19.466
Mr. Ye admires self-respect

9
00:00:19.566 --> 00:00:20.366
lie

10
00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:21.733
Sorry.

11
00:00:21.733 --> 00:00:24.200
I only now know that Qingqing is our child.

12
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:25.866
I know everything now.

13
00:00:26.466 --> 00:00:28.266
You two have a baby?

14
00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.633
That little bastard is yours

15
00:00:32.333 --> 00:00:32.900
Mo Yan

16
00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.200
I really didn't expect you to have a young English character

17
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.666
I read it wrong in college now.

18
00:00:36.666 --> 00:00:38.300
What about your first love in college?

19
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.133
You would have dragged the bed into the museum long ago

20
00:00:40.133 --> 00:00:42.300
And gave birth to a little wild species

21
00:00:42.566 --> 00:00:44.633
You are not a wild breed

22
00:00:46.066 --> 00:00:48.700
Han Yulong, don't think I don't know

23
00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:49.933
What's your idea?

24
00:00:49.933 --> 00:00:51.000
Don't think I don't know

25
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.500
Why did you marry me?

26
00:00:52.933 --> 00:00:55.300
Get used to how he knows everything

27
00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.666
This contract is because Hongyan saw my face

28
00:00:57.666 --> 00:00:58.366
To sign

29
00:00:58.366 --> 00:01:01.800
I didn't expect it to be a scam. Nonsense

30
00:01:01.933 --> 00:01:02.733
wildflower

31
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.833
I heard you almost drowned today

32
00:01:06.133 --> 00:01:07.366
Not dead yet

33
00:01:08.166 --> 00:01:09.533
Push your stuff on your nose

34
00:01:09.533 --> 00:01:12.000
After all, it is your Ye family who wants to climb up to me

35
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.733
Come here for winter vacation to make trouble

36
00:01:13.733 --> 00:01:16.666
Why don't you want to? Well, tomorrow's engagement party

37
00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:18.400
Do you still want to participate

38
00:01:19.066 --> 00:01:20.466
Hanjiang, you scold me

39
00:01:20.566 --> 00:01:22.600
You are crazy.

40
00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:25.466
Vice President, this finance is already going through the account

41
00:01:25.466 --> 00:01:28.133
It's too late for you to go back now

42
00:01:28.133 --> 00:01:28.933
first ring

43
00:01:29.366 --> 00:01:30.600
I mean it.

44
00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:31.400
Beauty

45
00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:32.800
Trust me.

46
00:01:34.466 --> 00:01:36.600
Mr. Han, let me make a call first

47
00:01:41.166 --> 00:01:43.600
The entire building has been blocked

48
00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.833
I'll see what you do.

49
00:01:50.366 --> 00:01:52.200
Hongyan, you can give this to me.

50
00:01:52.566 --> 00:01:54.566
That's a rich family heirloom

51
00:01:54.566 --> 00:01:57.933
It's worth 500 to you, what are you?

52
00:01:57.933 --> 00:02:00.966
Is it worth selling you at that price?

53
00:02:01.166 --> 00:02:01.966
first ring

54
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.400
To the vice president, don't let him be deceived

55
00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.466
Ye Hua, what the hell are you doing?

56
00:02:17.533 --> 00:02:19.700
You broke 5 million moment

57
00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.400
Vice President, I told you

58
00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.366
He's just here to make trouble.

59
00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.766
Hongyan does her best

60
00:02:26.966 --> 00:02:28.800
I will protect you in this life
