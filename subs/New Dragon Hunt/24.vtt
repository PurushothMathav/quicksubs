00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:03.366
Hahaha, what a crazy family

2
00:00:03.366 --> 00:00:04.533
This little brat

3
00:00:04.533 --> 00:00:06.366
It's just a bottle of Coke from the night drought

4
00:00:06.366 --> 00:00:08.166
Do you really think you are a superman?

5
00:00:08.166 --> 00:00:09.566
I'll tell you what.

6
00:00:09.766 --> 00:00:13.600
Fairy tales are lies

7
00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:17.633
Hahaha, you have already angered me.

8
00:00:21.333 --> 00:00:22.866
Grandpa this

9
00:00:23.533 --> 00:00:25.733
If I remember correctly

10
00:00:25.733 --> 00:00:27.266
The danger of this teacher

11
00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.000
The old man has lived a lifetime

12
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.300
I haven't seen a middle teacher who hasn't conceived milk yet?

13
00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.500
What kind of freaks are this family?

14
00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.900
Yaoyao liar, come here

15
00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:40.500
Here's my leg.

16
00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:49.966
Violent loli

17
00:00:49.966 --> 00:00:51.133
Am I not dreaming?

18
00:00:51.133 --> 00:00:52.100
Mom?

19
00:00:53.266 --> 00:00:54.066
green

20
00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.266
Today I will warn you again

21
00:00:56.366 --> 00:00:59.133
Never show mercy to bad people

22
00:00:59.133 --> 00:01:01.866
Trash that even a little girl can't clean up

23
00:01:01.866 --> 00:01:02.900
Get out of here

24
00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:04.233
Not enough to pay back the shame

25
00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:07.833
The whole body is full of blood

26
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.100
There is the ability of public corpses

27
00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.300
Are you mistaken?

28
00:01:12.366 --> 00:01:14.366
He was just an ordinary little girl

29
00:01:14.366 --> 00:01:15.966
Just drank a bottle of Coke

30
00:01:15.966 --> 00:01:17.666
Even if he is a dancer

31
00:01:17.666 --> 00:01:19.166
It starts in the womb.

32
00:01:19.166 --> 00:01:21.466
You can't become a great chef at the age of five or six

33
00:01:21.966 --> 00:01:22.766
Right?

34
00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.900
Wait, could it be because he drank that bottle of Coke?
