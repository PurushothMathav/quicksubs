00:00:03.266 --> 00:00:04.766
Sorry little friend

2
00:00:04.766 --> 00:00:08.300
I should pay for your clothes.

3
00:00:08.766 --> 00:00:12.933
Uh, I have a Skylark Gold card from the Skylark Hotel

4
00:00:12.933 --> 00:00:13.966
worth millions

5
00:00:13.966 --> 00:00:16.200
Just treat it as a little friend to lose clothes.

6
00:00:17.966 --> 00:00:20.533
I don't know Xiaoyouzun's name

7
00:00:20.533 --> 00:00:22.733
Can we make friends?

8
00:00:22.733 --> 00:00:25.466
My name is Ye. As for making friends

9
00:00:25.466 --> 00:00:26.466
You don't have the word yet

10
00:00:26.466 --> 00:00:28.900
Do you know who my grandfather is?

11
00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:30.166
You actually say that my grandfather is not qualified

12
00:00:30.166 --> 00:00:31.100
Make friends with you

13
00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:32.033
You

14
00:00:32.333 --> 00:00:34.800
My latter is speechless grandpa

15
00:00:37.866 --> 00:00:39.200
I see you're glowing.

16
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:40.333
refreshed

17
00:00:40.333 --> 00:00:41.400
Physical

18
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:42.733
Should be a rich man

19
00:00:42.733 --> 00:00:45.766
It's a pity to die

20
00:00:47.466 --> 00:00:49.033
China should not pass

21
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.400
Grandpa, look at him

22
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.466
He not only said that you are not qualified to be his friend

23
00:00:53.466 --> 00:00:55.800
And said you were going to die

24
00:00:57.766 --> 00:01:01.066
Although this young man is a little frivolous

25
00:01:01.066 --> 00:01:03.800
But not together

26
00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.266
The moment he passed by me

27
00:01:06.266 --> 00:01:10.000
I feel as if I have come into contact with ancient times

28
00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:11.933
The feeling of a beast

29
00:01:11.933 --> 00:01:15.833
He could kill me with one finger

30
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.400
I don't believe it.

31
00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.466
Just now, I was too big.

32
00:01:19.533 --> 00:01:20.700
Otherwise, I will

33
00:01:21.166 --> 00:01:24.300
Hey, look inside the river

34
00:01:25.366 --> 00:01:26.900
How is this possible?

35
00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.233
The fish in this river died

36
00:01:29.266 --> 00:01:31.300
There seems to be something wonderful

37
00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:33.366
Absorbed their vitality

38
00:01:33.366 --> 00:01:34.166
Grandpa

39
00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:35.866
That person just now

40
00:01:35.933 --> 00:01:37.666
It seems to have come out of the lake

41
00:01:37.666 --> 00:01:41.000
Red is doing everything possible to find this person

42
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.466
This person has unfathomable abilities
