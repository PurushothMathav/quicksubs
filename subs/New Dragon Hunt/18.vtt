00:00:04.966 --> 00:00:08.666
It is Mr. Xiao Qi of Qi County, the patron saint of southern Xinjiang. Welcome

2
00:00:08.666 --> 00:00:10.066
Welcome to the old god of war

3
00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:11.966
Welcome to the old god of war

4
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.666
The old God of War will make my Han family shine

5
00:00:16.666 --> 00:00:18.600
Uncle, what's going on?

6
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.066
Just a poser

7
00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:22.900
This person is making a fuss in the banquet hall

8
00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:23.933
Business opportunities are innocent

9
00:00:23.933 --> 00:00:26.333
I'm producing it free of charge. His name is Ye Huan.

10
00:00:26.333 --> 00:00:29.000
Knowing that the Governor would come to the banquet

11
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.166
Still making trouble here

12
00:00:30.166 --> 00:00:31.966
Ye Huan, interview the governor

13
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.266
And he also wounded the grandmaster brought by the governor

14
00:00:34.266 --> 00:00:35.066
even

15
00:00:35.333 --> 00:00:36.633
Kneel down for him

16
00:00:36.666 --> 00:00:37.833
What's going on?

17
00:00:38.466 --> 00:00:39.733
Now you're in trouble.

18
00:00:39.733 --> 00:00:42.500
Before retiring, the West Building was the warship of the Ministry of War

19
00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.466
It is the patron saint of Nanjing.

20
00:00:44.466 --> 00:00:45.300
This equals me

21
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:45.666
But

22
00:00:45.666 --> 00:00:47.800
We are not qualified to see him at all on weekdays

23
00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:52.466
Now this kid has ten lives, not enough for him to die

24
00:00:52.533 --> 00:00:54.566
He is kind of in front of the guardian

25
00:00:54.566 --> 00:00:56.266
You bully another one, let me see

26
00:00:56.266 --> 00:00:58.300
Fang Dashen I

27
00:00:58.666 --> 00:01:00.433
My son has a brain problem.

28
00:01:00.666 --> 00:01:02.200
You hit people regardless of petty

29
00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:03.266
It's all our fault

30
00:01:03.266 --> 00:01:04.733
Spare his life

31
00:01:04.733 --> 00:01:05.533
Dad?

32
00:01:06.466 --> 00:01:08.533
If it is expensive, they are expensive.

33
00:01:08.533 --> 00:01:10.566
Xiaohuan, what are you talking about?

34
00:01:10.566 --> 00:01:12.100
Don't you really want to live?

35
00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.000
Ye Huan, you are in front of the old god of war

36
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.700
How dare you talk nonsense here?

37
00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:16.933
Thaksin's guardian general

38
00:01:16.933 --> 00:01:18.933
Does this person have a scar?

39
00:01:18.933 --> 00:01:21.466
Don't know all the masters as enemies

40
00:01:21.466 --> 00:01:23.566
A sparrow is a sparrow after all

41
00:01:24.133 --> 00:01:25.800
What does that mean?

42
00:01:25.933 --> 00:01:27.600
The dinosaur told him
