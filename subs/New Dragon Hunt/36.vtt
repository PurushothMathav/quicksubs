1
00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.266
My Zhao family is unreliable

2
00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:06.766
You are you

3
00:00:08.166 --> 00:00:12.100
You also broke the inheritance of my Zhao family for thousands of years

4
00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:17.000
It's you who would rather the Zhao family be doomed

5
00:00:18.733 --> 00:00:21.333
Impossible how could this be

6
00:00:21.333 --> 00:00:22.900
Nothing is impossible

7
00:00:24.266 --> 00:00:27.366
Han down, do you have anything else to say?

8
00:00:28.933 --> 00:00:31.300
Ye Hua, for the sake of our correction

9
00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:32.633
Please forgive me.

10
00:00:32.666 --> 00:00:33.600
Please forgive me.

11
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.533
Do you know that in order to wait until today

12
00:00:35.533 --> 00:00:37.000
How many years have I waited?

13
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.200
Did you know that your Han family caused my wife to be separated?

14
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.200
Broken family

15
00:00:41.266 --> 00:00:42.633
I don't know.

16
00:00:42.733 --> 00:00:43.866
I don't have it.

17
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.766
I don't have I don't have I don't have

18
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.633
Mr. Ye said there is

19
00:00:55.333 --> 00:00:57.300
Do you have anything else to say?

20
00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.533
Sir, it was indeed a misunderstanding just now.

21
00:00:59.533 --> 00:01:00.600
We shouldn't use

22
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.666
I shouldn't have misunderstood you in prison

23
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.066
Misunderstandings are all misunderstandings

24
00:01:06.066 --> 00:01:09.466
Our New Zealand Jiang Awei is not comprehensive

25
00:01:09.466 --> 00:01:11.900
I am willing to apologize to you.

26
00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:13.700
I would also like to apologize to sir

27
00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.600
My Ministry of War would like to recommend you to the King of Nanjiang Building

28
00:01:17.766 --> 00:01:20.833
My household department is willing to allocate tens of billions, please forgive me, sir

29
00:01:20.866 --> 00:01:22.166
Oh, it does?

30
00:01:22.166 --> 00:01:23.866
Since it was a misunderstanding

31
00:01:23.933 --> 00:01:25.566
I won't go too far into that.

32
00:01:25.566 --> 00:01:28.166
You are here
