00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:04.566
Hey, you can't disrupt it. The cooperation has been cancelled.

2
00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:07.666
Mr. Ye, are you sure that the project has been cancelled?

3
00:00:10.166 --> 00:00:10.900
Suspension of payment

4
00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:12.266
I'll wait for the personal instructions of the vice president.

5
00:00:12.266 --> 00:00:12.933
Vice President

6
00:00:12.933 --> 00:00:16.566
We don't have time to watch this kid act here

7
00:00:16.566 --> 00:00:19.633
This contract is not signed yet

8
00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:21.266
I thought he was capable of something

9
00:00:21.266 --> 00:00:23.766
I didn't expect to just sit here and meditate

10
00:00:23.766 --> 00:00:25.200
It's hilarious

11
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.066
This is sitting here like a fool

12
00:00:27.066 --> 00:00:29.200
Is this more of a sit-in protest?

13
00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:32.100
Hahaha come

14
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:34.100
Get him out of here

15
00:00:34.166 --> 00:00:37.600
Mr. Han, did you invite a loyal minister?

16
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:39.633
What's going on here?

17
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:43.666
What did they say?

18
00:00:43.966 --> 00:00:46.933
It was said that Ye Huan personally went to the door to inform them

19
00:00:46.933 --> 00:00:47.966
How is that possible?

20
00:00:48.166 --> 00:00:51.100
Others are rolling here

21
00:00:58.866 --> 00:01:00.900
Yihuan, are you alright?

22
00:01:05.366 --> 00:01:06.233
engagement party tomorrow

23
00:01:06.333 --> 00:01:07.400
You get up with your luggage

24
00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.000
I will definitely surprise you.

25
00:01:13.866 --> 00:01:16.766
I like you to wait for me.

26
00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.533
Tomorrow, you must become the leader of the entire southern Xinjiang

27
00:01:19.533 --> 00:01:20.366
soldier

28
00:01:21.066 --> 00:01:23.200
This is what you forced me to do.

29
00:01:29.166 --> 00:01:31.400
Nice. It's full of life.

30
00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.366
If all the vitality here is absorbed

31
00:01:33.366 --> 00:01:35.100
It should make up for the weather.

32
00:01:35.566 --> 00:01:38.633
Kill the gods and kill all bitters

33
00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.266
Grandpa Walker

34
00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.133
You've been retired for years

35
00:02:03.133 --> 00:02:04.966
Why do you have to make such a big gesture?

36
00:02:04.966 --> 00:02:06.666
Isn't grandpa fishing?

37
00:02:06.666 --> 00:02:09.033
It should bite the hook.

38
00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.000
Sister-in-law

39
00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:15.500
Don't run

40
00:02:16.533 --> 00:02:18.200
Grandpa ran away

41
00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:20.500
It's not good to be a loyal teacher

42
00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.400
Protect my grandpa

43
00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.000
Why are you having such a big fight?

44
00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:25.833
Your hook

45
00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:27.466
Take my clothes
