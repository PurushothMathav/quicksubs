00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:02.166
Humph ridiculous

2
00:00:02.166 --> 00:00:04.466
Our top ten supplements of gold and silver last more than a thousand years

3
00:00:04.466 --> 00:00:05.666
You know our assets

4
00:00:05.666 --> 00:00:07.333
How big is the sum?

5
00:00:07.333 --> 00:00:10.800
A mere team leader Weaver Girl, I'm afraid I'll kill you

6
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.133
Doesn't a big tree have to have a tree?

7
00:00:13.133 --> 00:00:15.566
Besides, what I do is a U-turn business

8
00:00:15.566 --> 00:00:17.466
In case something goes wrong

9
00:00:17.466 --> 00:00:20.200
Then I have to give our Huang Yan an explanation?

10
00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.866
I like it, don't worry, it's alright.

11
00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:25.500
how

12
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.666
I can't bear Mr. Ye

13
00:00:27.666 --> 00:00:29.966
You are forcing us not to give us a way to live

14
00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:31.200
I am the Lord

15
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.500
It is disrespectful for you to call me Mr. Ye.

16
00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.066
I don't care what the world thinks

17
00:00:35.066 --> 00:00:37.100
Today you forced me to go to this faucet gate

18
00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:38.800
Since you don't give me a way to live

19
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.600
How can I give you a way to live?

20
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.566
We know your background very well

21
00:00:42.566 --> 00:00:45.266
You are nothing like standing on the top of the mountain

22
00:00:45.266 --> 00:00:47.300
If you have a kind, let us be convinced

23
00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.400
I made such a big commotion today

24
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:50.566
support add-on

25
00:00:50.566 --> 00:00:52.533
To make the world shut up

26
00:00:52.533 --> 00:00:54.966
In order to convince the world

27
00:00:54.966 --> 00:00:57.666
Do you want to transfer this half of the assets or not?

28
00:00:57.666 --> 00:00:58.500
We recognize

29
00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.333
He's the real jazz warrior.

30
00:01:00.333 --> 00:01:03.066
If the Holy Lord has a seed, let us be convinced

31
00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:07.900
Okay, so I'll bet with you today.

32
00:01:08.133 --> 00:01:09.066
How to bet

33
00:01:09.066 --> 00:01:11.266
If I survive under this faucet gate

34
00:01:11.266 --> 00:01:12.600
Then your ten ancient tribes

35
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.500
I want to be the dog under my feet

36
00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:15.566
Have any funds

37
00:01:15.566 --> 00:01:17.233
Family collapse
