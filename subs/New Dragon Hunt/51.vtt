1
00:00:00.466 --> 00:00:01.866
Roll as a business

2
00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:06.200
The iron bear is dead

3
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:08.000
Wildflowers are such a homeless dog

4
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:09.766
What kind of power is this?

5
00:00:09.766 --> 00:00:12.066
Qi unloading armor is no match for Iron Bear

6
00:00:12.066 --> 00:00:12.866
He actually

7
00:00:13.566 --> 00:00:16.966
In one sentence, he took over the fifth powerhouse of Great Xia

8
00:00:16.966 --> 00:00:19.133
Ye Huan, when did you become so powerful?

9
00:00:19.133 --> 00:00:20.666
Am I not dreaming?

10
00:00:20.866 --> 00:00:22.400
The difference between you and me is that

11
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.333
I killed you in the blink of an eye

12
00:00:24.333 --> 00:00:26.533
Wealth is all glory

13
00:00:26.533 --> 00:00:28.266
Worthless in the face of life and death

14
00:00:28.266 --> 00:00:29.933
Do you know who I am?

15
00:00:29.933 --> 00:00:31.933
Do you dare to touch me?

16
00:00:31.933 --> 00:00:33.400
You want to die?

17
00:00:33.933 --> 00:00:35.366
Ye Hun, please stop

18
00:00:35.366 --> 00:00:37.333
The Ye family in the imperial capital is one of the ten ancient tribes

19
00:00:37.333 --> 00:00:38.900
The Gods of the Three Emperors and Five Emperors already exist

20
00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:40.366
It is the top ten surnames in ancient times

21
00:00:40.366 --> 00:00:41.366
It's a huge legacy.

22
00:00:41.366 --> 00:00:42.900
We are unshakable

23
00:00:42.933 --> 00:00:44.400
I'll popularize it for you again.

24
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.100
What are the top ten jobs that are endless?

25
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.133
Unattainable

26
00:00:48.133 --> 00:00:49.100
precious

27
00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.900
Even the status is above the royal family of the building

28
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.766
You dare to touch a hair of Ye Shao

29
00:00:53.766 --> 00:00:56.166
There will be no place for you in the whole of Nanjing

30
00:00:56.166 --> 00:00:57.900
What are you still doing?

31
00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:00.100
Why don't you let Ye Shao go quickly?

32
00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:01.866
What if something happened to the man?

33
00:01:01.866 --> 00:01:04.766
It's hard to bury everyone with you

34
00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:06.666
Is this your mortal vision?

35
00:01:06.666 --> 00:01:09.166
Obviously, I like to kill him like a murderer

36
00:01:09.166 --> 00:01:10.700
But you are still willing to minister

37
00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.366
Submit to one of his
