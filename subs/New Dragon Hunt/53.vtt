00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:01.466
Let go of me you pervert

2
00:00:02.733 --> 00:00:03.566
let go

3
00:00:04.266 --> 00:00:05.833
Fu Hongyan Fu Hongyan

4
00:00:05.866 --> 00:00:06.166
You say

5
00:00:06.166 --> 00:00:08.500
Why don't you understand my infatuation?

6
00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:10.000
Ben is so kind to you

7
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.766
But you are with that Mr. Ye?

8
00:00:12.766 --> 00:00:13.900
I remember now.

9
00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:15.133
If memory serves

10
00:00:15.133 --> 00:00:17.300
You shouldn't be other than this

11
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.700
Lan Huang is a bad person to you

12
00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:22.866
You're crazy too

13
00:00:22.866 --> 00:00:24.133
These words are being said now

14
00:00:24.133 --> 00:00:26.066
Are you worthy of your noble status?

15
00:00:26.333 --> 00:00:27.133
Ha ha.

16
00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.366
Identity is something you're born with.

17
00:00:30.366 --> 00:00:33.566
It's the captain, you were born with it, you were born without it

18
00:00:33.566 --> 00:00:34.900
Even if you try your best

19
00:00:35.066 --> 00:00:37.633
It's not going to be full of people.

20
00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:39.633
Brother-in-law says ordinary people

21
00:00:39.666 --> 00:00:43.200
Even if you have a rich family?

22
00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.666
In my eyes, it is like the world of ant grass

23
00:00:45.666 --> 00:00:46.466
Not the slightest

24
00:00:46.933 --> 00:00:48.800
What the hell are you lyrics?

25
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:49.966
What do you mean?

26
00:00:49.966 --> 00:00:52.000
I'm just playing with you

27
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.833
I didn't expect you to take it seriously.

28
00:00:55.533 --> 00:00:57.066
Be reserved with my dad, right?

29
00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:00.166
Well, that young master will die with you

30
00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.166
Yeah wait wait

31
00:01:02.166 --> 00:01:04.966
You said I had promised to marry your daughter to you

32
00:01:04.966 --> 00:01:06.966
Why are you still doing this?

33
00:01:06.966 --> 00:01:07.800
Why is that?

34
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.866
It's because of your good daughter that you angered people

35
00:01:09.866 --> 00:01:10.666
Ye Shao

36
00:01:11.133 --> 00:01:14.400
That's right, you say Ye Shao is so noble

37
00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.166
And a neat freak.

38
00:01:16.166 --> 00:01:18.133
How can you fall in love with a second-hand product?

39
00:01:18.133 --> 00:01:20.566
There are tears, I am optimistic about you

40
00:01:21.266 --> 00:01:23.200
Hahaha

41
00:01:25.166 --> 00:01:27.600
Offside introduction to the work of the puppy

42
00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.266
Okay.

43
00:01:29.566 --> 00:01:31.100
Hold him down for me

44
00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.466
I want to play with his woman in front of Ye Huan
