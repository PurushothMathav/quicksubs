00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:05.530
Eyes, you received the bill today, right?

2
00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:06.410
Where is that concubine?

3
00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:07.800
He went to attend the wedding

4
00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:10.860
Anyway, now the yellow car material gift has been introduced.

5
00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:12.740
One month later, find a gift and a wedding ceremony

6
00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:15.320
Mom, you are cheating on your marriage

7
00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:16.820
What happened to me being deceived into marriage?

8
00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.180
He is a concubine, even if she is deceived into marriage

9
00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:20.550
You can take me again

10
00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.220
Mom, after all, she can sell Yun Ding Farewell Book and compilation

11
00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:25.460
Even without her, we would still be rich.

12
00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:26.840
Not ignorant either

13
00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:28.170
What happened to having money?

14
00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.250
Eye, you are the definition of beauty in China

15
00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:34.330
Mom can count on you to marry Duoquan Renshi

16
00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:35.670
marry a concubine

17
00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.610
Can we still count on our boss?

18
00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:48.650
You are not left, Yang Er, the alley boss

19
00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:52.570
I really don’t admit that you were deceived by Zhan Tiancheng.

20
00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:54.140
what do you mean

21
00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:58.310
What's this

22
00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:00.170
Zhan Tiancheng's Dai Guan Zhang Dan

23
00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:02.350
It turns out that he was able to buy it before

24
00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:03.610
Genting farewell book and military strength

25
00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:08.040
They are all asking me to buy and borrow them, so do I.

26
00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:13.200
Only later did I know Yang Er

27
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.440
I'm worried about you in the future

28
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.120
It would be very difficult to follow him.

29
00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:18.060
I'll just say it

30
00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:18.820
He is so angry

31
00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:19.700
How can you be rich?

32
00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:20.880
Buying a car or a house

33
00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.280
It turns out they are all like you on the street

34
00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:24.710
why is he always once

35
00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:26.030
You want to lie to me once

36
00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:33.410
Since I'm playing with my trust

37
00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.280
You still don’t agree with things
