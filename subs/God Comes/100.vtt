00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:03.250
It’s really nice to take a break from reading,

2
00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:05.990
It's a pity that all of you must die.

3
00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:08.400
Immortal Toho,

4
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.420
What do you mean, I have long since arrested you and brought you here to study.

5
00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:14.620
Instead, he will die unintentionally,

6
00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:17.430
False love, this,

7
00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.690
Use it big, think that I have God in me,

8
00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:23.730
It's a pity that I can use it to do my homework.

9
00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:25.690
And this is not an ordinary study,

10
00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:29.740
Heaven, the power of the gods,

11
00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.040
God, she is God,

12
00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:32.980
Days are born, days, days, days, days, days, days, days, days, days, days, days, days, days, days, days, days, days, days, days, days, days, days, days, Day, day, day, day, day, day, day, day, day

13
00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:34.300
Indeed the legend

14
00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.280
The determined hatred of reincarnation

15
00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:37.980
There is an ancestor at the headquarters

16
00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.680
once mentioned and at this time

17
00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:42.120
I didn’t expect it to be a real God

18
00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.580
Because I'm so far away

19
00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:45.900
But you are so far away

20
00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:49.390
It's always fun to protect your people

21
00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:53.410
Then use your divine power to be strict here, I'm high

22
00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.640
Use it for ten minutes

23
00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.080
Within these ten minutes

24
00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:58.970
i kill you enough

25
00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:00.170
I'd like to see

26
00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:01.730
You can't afford to bleed

27
00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:03.790
Use your life to save him

28
00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:05.650
Good to play boat

29
00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:06.610
We are boaters

30
00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:07.570
Also walk away from people

31
00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:52.970
Okay, master, I don’t want to refuse the answer. Yes, please call someone.

32
00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:03.810
I will beat you to clear the game and choose to teach you. Good luck to me.

33
00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:09.500
It's my favorite. Don't tell me. I know.

34
00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:16.440
If you shouldn't go, will you?

35
00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:19.360
won't let you die
