00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:06.160
I regret that you waited until our Lin family won these eleven orders and entered the upper echelons of power.

2
00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:09.120
I will regret it when I see it, right?

3
00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.660
At that time, you can be asked to take you into the upper realms.

4
00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:14.730
Not only do you take things in front of you

5
00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:17.140
Brother, you still want it

6
00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:19.340
I have long seen that there is something irregular in Zhantian City.

7
00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:22.860
Why don't you give it to us as a receptionist?

8
00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:31.110
Duck, are you willing to believe me this time?

9
00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:33.620
Mom, letâ€™s go

10
00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:45.310
let's go let's be

11
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:53.420
Ya'er, today is the last date for our Master Lin to hand over to Lujia.

12
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.780
As long as we put the fire on Li Jia's hands

13
00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:57.000
Hurry up and find a greaser

14
00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.280
Divorce that wife

15
00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.280
But what's the big deal?

16
00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:03.320
The real intention has come true

17
00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.550
As long as we have a relationship with the Kamisato family,

18
00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:06.750
Then the powerful people in Beijing

19
00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.130
Will definitely interact with us

20
00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.330
Even if you get married then

21
00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:12.270
But the price is high for a powerful man in Beijing

22
00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.350
There should be no problem

23
00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.120
If you temporarily enter the powerful family of a powerful person in Beijing,

24
00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:17.500
I will come closer to you

25
00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:18.950
Add to that

26
00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:22.100
But Zhan Tiancheng

27
00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:23.780
Haven't been back for a month

28
00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.580
Spent during the day

29
00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.400
Our mission at home is more complete

30
00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.820
Then my daughter can show her that day

31
00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.700
Then the price of a hospital admission will go up.

32
00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.040
A grown-up man, right?

33
00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:45.560
How could this happen? What's wrong with mom?

34
00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:48.620
do you speak

35
00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:50.140
That guy's ring

36
00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:51.840
He actually counterattacked halfway

37
00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.920
Then if you are still alive, I will go and you think about it

38
00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.180
let's have a real day

39
00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:00.460
I can't protect you

40
00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:02.450
Otherwise Biden
