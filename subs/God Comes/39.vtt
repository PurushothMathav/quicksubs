00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.340
You can't afford to do so much harm in your life.

2
00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:05.780
The five nobles’ VIP level is five billion

3
00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:09.020
Dad, can Lin Jia make so much money now?

4
00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:10.980
Five, it’s all your fault

5
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:13.480
Where are we going to pick up these five billion now?

6
00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:14.860
How can you blame me?

7
00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:16.640
I have no problem discussing projects.

8
00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.300
It's Lin Jia's problem.

9
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.420
Then you mean

10
00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:20.780
It's our Lin Jia's problem

11
00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:21.760
What about people?

12
00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:23.100
It's not my delivery

13
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.200
Stop talking, everyone.

14
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:25.180
It is urgent now

15
00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:26.920
I received five billion first

16
00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:29.040
Doesn’t pinpin pinpin like you?

17
00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:30.120
You can ask him to borrow it

18
00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:31.120
I'm married now

19
00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:32.299
Borrow money from him

20
00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:33.440
It's always bad, right?

21
00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:34.380
That's not simple yet

22
00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.440
You and I Tianchan paid for the wedding.

23
00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:37.940
Didn’t you buy it if you got married here?

24
00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.400
Where did I go with this money from my natural inheritance?

25
00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:42.320
Talk about calling him back

26
00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.330
Pay back the blame for the money

27
00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:45.450
Marry me and follow us

28
00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:46.830
Is the one I am using for the first time?

29
00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:48.150
Divorce him cleanly

30
00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:53.470
Miss Lan is so kind-hearted

31
00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:56.690
You actually came here to gain more of my natural wealth

32
00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:00.760
The tone I used when I spoke to you last time was inappropriate for me.

33
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.140
but please help me

34
00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:03.040
marry me

35
00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.780
I won't marry you

36
00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:07.060
People are about to play

37
00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:08.200
You can divorce your industry

38
00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.300
marry me

39
00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:10.820
How could you take advantage of your employer?

40
00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:12.350
Could it be that you were also involved?
