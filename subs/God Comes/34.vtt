00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.000
You came all the way today just to talk about these Easterners,

2
00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:09.270
I'm really looking forward to seeing what the wedding of the number one person in China will be like.

3
00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:11.370
We are also getting married for the second time, so let’s keep your butts at bay.

4
00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:13.390
According to what you call Lishengguan.

5
00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:15.980
You, you can’t even bring it up.

6
00:00:16.239 --> 00:00:18.940
But why have I heard that the less capable a person is, the more evil he is?

7
00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:22.220
But who can do it? We don’t have the ability. You can do it with your ability, and get out.

8
00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.100
Ye'er, let me just say, marrying a man with no status or status like this will just change you.

9
00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:34.830
Right now it’s just about weddings. I don’t know how many installments of such expenses will be issued in the future to account for Tiancheng.

10
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.360
My wedding to Yal

11
00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:14.690
It’s the entire Chinese nation Mengmei

12
00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:16.210
I don’t want this even if I ask for it.

13
00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:18.980
do you want to say

14
00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:20.500
There has been a lot of trouble in the past few days in the early morning.

15
00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:21.500
A place of good fortune

16
00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:22.400
The remaining wedding

17
00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:26.690
Of course it's enough to be with you, Tianchen

18
00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:28.070
It’s really not necessary for a wedding, right?

19
00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:30.980
I don’t want to be Quan Yuancheng’s grandpa

20
00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.340
Why do you never believe me

21
00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:44.780
I just don’t want you to become a strong person and spend whatever you want, novice

22
00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:50.600
Wedding breast removal early in the morning

23
00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:52.770
You don’t want a wedding

24
00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:54.740
You will regret it later
