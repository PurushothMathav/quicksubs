1
00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:11.920
I'll pick it up for a while.

2
00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:14.010
Thank you. My mother is back.

3
00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.260
What went wrong? Mom will make another mistake again.

4
00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:19.580
Mom, thank you.

5
00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.820
What is our situation today?

6
00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:30.680
I haven't figured it out yet.

7
00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.520
The results of the simple inspection will be available soon. When will the results of the simple inspection be available?

8
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.570
It will take another day or two.

9
00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:37.090
Auntie's body is very weak.

10
00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:38.310
Residents must be observed for a week.

11
00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:41.180
Then my mother has been with you.

12
00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.920
Thank you. You were not polite to me.

13
00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:55.910
Grandpa, how are you lately?

14
00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:58.400
Do I blame my latest job?

15
00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.970
If it doesn’t taste good, you just take medicine. Thank you.

16
00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:03.600
It's no big deal

17
00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:06.250
How have you been lately?

18
00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.810
I'm fine just

19
00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.580
Then these fresh stores will say

20
00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.920
I might not be able to go home if I'm tired of it

21
00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.180
What kind of family hate

22
00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.640
Is it no problem?

23
00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.520
My parents are all in the book. Thank you. Thank you. It’s nothing.

24
00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:23.620
I'm relieved

25
00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:27.020
My mom is just feeling a little unwell. Thank you.

26
00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:32.130
If you have anything to pay for, it’s okay if you’re busy.

27
00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:34.070
My mom’s New Year’s organization

28
00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:35.610
It was all done with your help

29
00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:36.770
Your answer bro

30
00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:40.440
I've given up kissing that kid all my life

31
00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.580
Now you and Mu Shan are getting along well

32
00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:46.420
This is the biggest report of the year

33
00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:47.260
I'll take him
