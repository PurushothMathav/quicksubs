1
00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:03.930
I'll give An An a score for today's homework.

2
00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:06.920
The shooting situation has been getting better and better in the past two months.

3
00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:11.280
So, so I want to do it at the beginning of his third year,

4
00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:13.050
Isnâ€™t it possible not to do it?

5
00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:17.660
Parents, sooner or later we will meet this section.

6
00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:22.040
Do you think he is still unwilling to forgive me?

7
00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:24.820
I have forgiven you long ago,

8
00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.100
It's just between us, it's really impossible.

9
00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.500
Really impossible.

10
00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:44.830
impossible.

11
00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:46.580
You've been leading a life like this lately

12
00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:51.910
If I didn't come here, I wouldn't know you have become like this.

13
00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:53.910
Neither you nor aunt want me anymore

14
00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:56.140
I hope it will be the same again

15
00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:58.420
Auntie will never be the same again

16
00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.000
Auntie has had a virus this month

17
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.560
good quiet

18
00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:06.650
The student said that his condition has become personal

19
00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:07.570
Don't get up

20
00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:08.530
I'll take you to see him
