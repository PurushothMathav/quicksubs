00:00:01.690 --> 00:00:03.830
Girl, how is she doing?

2
00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:06.550
Will you be here for a long time? But the situation is not that long,

3
00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:09.470
A piece of gold bowl, if spring does not pass?

4
00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:13.520
Miss, you are messing with everyone,

5
00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.440
When you mess around, you have already passed.

6
00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.920
Why can't parents solve the problem of girls?

7
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.580
You know who is teaching you when we are making phone calls?

8
00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.900
Are they messing around? Thank you, thank you,

9
00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:30.200
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you,

10
00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.299
Thank you, thank you, thank you,

11
00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:33.020
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you,

12
00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:35.200
you hit me

13
00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.060
What are you going to do?

14
00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:39.140
The thought of being sick is scary

15
00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:42.220
Didn't you say you love me?

16
00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:43.200
Look up

17
00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:49.260
We'll be fine if you get up, but we're here

18
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:50.660
You can't do this

19
00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:52.240
Come I feel loved

20
00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:59.980
Find a grandma by your side

21
00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:01.400
I am surrounded by family members

22
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:02.540
I am surrounded by family members

23
00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:04.300
I am surrounded by family members
