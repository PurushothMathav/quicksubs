00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:04.200
Ah, who did I think it was?

2
00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.633
It turned out to be a little wild species born before my mother.

3
00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:11.100
Son, look at you, you are hot, wipe your sweat

4
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:12.366
Did you see

5
00:00:12.533 --> 00:00:16.066
This is the favorite of our family

6
00:00:16.166 --> 00:00:17.900
Not like you trash

7
00:00:17.966 --> 00:00:20.333
You hurry up and go back to your place where the bird doesn't shit

8
00:00:20.333 --> 00:00:21.133
Be a farmer for a lifetime

9
00:00:21.133 --> 00:00:21.966
Plant for a lifetime

10
00:00:21.966 --> 00:00:25.400
You farmers are no less than any of you.

11
00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.166
Why do you look down on farmers?

12
00:00:27.166 --> 00:00:28.466
So humiliate me

13
00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:31.300
Just look down on you, what's wrong with this trash?

14
00:00:31.666 --> 00:00:34.400
Ouch my good grandson

15
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.800
The provincial champion

16
00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.866
The dragon and the phoenix among the real people

17
00:00:38.866 --> 00:00:42.633
He can humiliate you however he wants

18
00:00:42.866 --> 00:00:46.966
You trash can only have thinner portions

19
00:00:46.966 --> 00:00:49.400
The champion can humiliate people at will

20
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.366
Don't you think you're funny?

21
00:00:51.366 --> 00:00:52.966
The funny thing is you

22
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:54.066
I'll tell you what.

23
00:00:54.066 --> 00:00:55.666
Today's oath ceremony

24
00:00:55.666 --> 00:00:58.366
It's for all the sports ships selected for Olympic training

25
00:00:58.366 --> 00:00:59.600
And prepared

26
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:01.666
It's for the world-breaking weightlifting

27
00:01:01.666 --> 00:01:03.200
Prepared by the genius of records

28
00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.366
Today it's all for him

29
00:01:05.733 --> 00:01:09.566
And you're just a clarifying young woman

30
00:01:09.966 --> 00:01:12.766
You're right about my nephew

31
00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.400
Everything today

32
00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.066
All for the genius who broke the world record

33
00:01:17.066 --> 00:01:17.866
strategy

34
00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.066
He will be a comprehensive national and even the world

35
00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.266
The brightest star

36
00:01:23.566 --> 00:01:25.733
A rising star like this

37
00:01:25.733 --> 00:01:26.866
World Champion

38
00:01:27.166 --> 00:01:30.233
How can you, a trash, claim it?

39
00:01:30.366 --> 00:01:34.000
That's right, the genius who broke the world record this time

40
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.900
Don't say trash like you

41
00:01:36.866 --> 00:01:38.600
Even I feel inferior when chatting for a while

42
00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:41.366
Why are you talking wildly?

43
00:01:41.366 --> 00:01:43.233
Dare to say this banquet is for you

44
00:01:43.333 --> 00:01:44.500
Just by

45
00:01:44.566 --> 00:01:48.000
I'm the genius who broke the world record for you
