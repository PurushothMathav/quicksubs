00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.100
Hahaha oops

2
00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:04.266
Breaking the world record

3
00:00:04.533 --> 00:00:06.033
Oh, dear.

4
00:00:06.066 --> 00:00:10.100
Lin Jianguo, you are not afraid of blowing the sky

5
00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.666
He hasn't made any progress over the years.

6
00:00:12.666 --> 00:00:15.266
You will only hit your face and make you fat

7
00:00:15.266 --> 00:00:17.100
A loser like you!

8
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.566
Deserved to be abandoned by me

9
00:00:18.566 --> 00:00:20.666
Deserving to be looked down upon by everyone

10
00:00:20.966 --> 00:00:22.466
You have no right to say my dad

11
00:00:22.466 --> 00:00:24.133
My dad is the best man in the world

12
00:00:24.133 --> 00:00:25.400
You don't deserve him

13
00:00:25.466 --> 00:00:28.900
I don't deserve him

14
00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:30.733
I have talent and good looks

15
00:00:30.733 --> 00:00:33.866
I'm more than enough for him to go back and forth a hundred times

16
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.733
When a man has no ability to earn money

17
00:00:36.733 --> 00:00:38.333
Can't let his woman live

18
00:00:38.333 --> 00:00:39.566
The days of fine clothes and jade food

19
00:00:39.566 --> 00:00:41.433
He's a loser.

20
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.766
I'm so glad I left him early

21
00:00:43.766 --> 00:00:46.466
Otherwise, I will be tied up in you for the rest of my life

22
00:00:46.466 --> 00:00:49.466
Ah, how can I have a chance to sign this 200 million big order

23
00:00:49.733 --> 00:00:50.500
Do you think this

24
00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.766
200 million order was obtained

25
00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:55.966
Why are you laughing?

26
00:00:56.066 --> 00:00:57.600
Why don't you speak?

27
00:00:57.933 --> 00:00:59.300
You got me right, right?

28
00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.100
Nothing to say

29
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:05.066
I laugh if you're really that capable

30
00:01:05.066 --> 00:01:07.233
I wouldn't have abandoned my husband and daughter

31
00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.100
Finding the next one before getting divorced

32
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.600
A waste disability

33
00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.500
The seed of a disabled waste

34
00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.366
What are you two doing?

35
00:01:18.366 --> 00:01:20.600
Do I block myself?

36
00:01:20.866 --> 00:01:21.666
Liu Huanxin

37
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.666
Ben was your daughter

38
00:01:23.766 --> 00:01:25.366
You can't insult him like that.

39
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.266
Loneliness doesn't eat to death

40
00:01:28.566 --> 00:01:31.766
What's more, his daughter is now promising

41
00:01:31.866 --> 00:01:35.400
Did you know he was just at the tryouts

42
00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.566
Breaking the world record

43
00:01:38.566 --> 00:01:40.900
Hahaha world record

44
00:01:40.966 --> 00:01:42.566
That's a world record!

45
00:01:42.566 --> 00:01:44.300
Then what is my son?

46
00:01:44.566 --> 00:01:47.033
Up to now, you are still bragging

47
00:01:47.133 --> 00:01:48.866
If he breaks the world record

48
00:01:48.866 --> 00:01:50.633
That sow can climb trees

49
00:01:50.966 --> 00:01:52.466
You are a waste

50
00:01:52.466 --> 00:01:55.200
No money, no skills, you can't even pay the tuition

51
00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.466
He's such a loser

52
00:01:56.466 --> 00:01:57.666
How did he become a world champion?

53
00:01:57.666 --> 00:02:00.366
Oh oh just because of his appetite like a pig?

54
00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:01.300
Liu Huixin

55
00:02:02.066 --> 00:02:03.466
You can't say Wenwen like that.

56
00:02:03.933 --> 00:02:06.000
He really broke the world record.

57
00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:09.133
Dead and crippled, less posturing here

58
00:02:09.133 --> 00:02:10.733
Act like the real thing

59
00:02:10.733 --> 00:02:12.700
He's just an edible piece of crap.

60
00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.066
You can't become a genius if you reproduce it 300 times

61
00:02:16.366 --> 00:02:20.233
The real genius is my son Aotian Chen

62
00:02:20.466 --> 00:02:22.533
You are worlds apart

63
00:02:22.533 --> 00:02:25.300
How can he be you trash and you turtle?

64
00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.800
Compare correctly

65
00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.000
Chen Aotian is the champion of Shen

66
00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.300
But my grades were higher than his.

67
00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:33.700
Better than him

68
00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:37.800
Hey, bragging doesn't make drafts

69
00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.100
He's a provincial champion.

70
00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:40.733
Are you better than him?

71
00:02:40.733 --> 00:02:43.833
So you're the world champion? Yes!
