00:00:00.533 --> 00:00:01.466
Wait a minute.

2
00:00:09.766 --> 00:00:11.400
Don't say cousin bullies you

3
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.800
What you were about to lift just now was lifted by me

4
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:15.233
Important how can this work

5
00:00:16.266 --> 00:00:18.666
You eat several times more than others

6
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.100
Cousin naturally has to give you some weight, right?

7
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.066
Yes, otherwise there would be so many of us.

8
00:00:25.066 --> 00:00:26.066
Looking at you eagerly

9
00:00:26.066 --> 00:00:27.333
Take something like this

10
00:00:27.333 --> 00:00:28.466
What do you mean?

11
00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:32.100
Now lift 200 kilograms

12
00:00:39.466 --> 00:00:40.266
Ah!

13
00:00:40.533 --> 00:00:43.866
Hahahaha

14
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:46.400
Hahahaha

15
00:00:47.066 --> 00:00:50.200
Hahahahaha

16
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.266
Hahahaha

17
00:00:56.966 --> 00:01:00.666
Sorry, I'm still a little hypoglycemic and can't work

18
00:01:00.733 --> 00:01:02.366
I'll eat a little more

19
00:01:04.333 --> 00:01:06.966
Old Tang, you put your reputation on it

20
00:01:07.066 --> 00:01:10.366
Just to let us watch the live broadcast of the rice bucket

21
00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:11.700
This miracle

22
00:01:12.533 --> 00:01:16.200
It's not that easy to create.

23
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.833
Forget it, don't waste everyone's time.

24
00:01:21.166 --> 00:01:21.966
Judges

25
00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.900
Give this little girl two more chances

26
00:01:25.333 --> 00:01:27.300
If he can't lift it three times

27
00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:31.100
Then I have nothing to say

28
00:01:46.733 --> 00:01:49.566
Hahahahahahaha

29
00:01:49.566 --> 00:01:51.233
Oops hahaha

30
00:01:51.266 --> 00:01:52.766
Did you just eat something?

31
00:01:52.766 --> 00:01:55.933
What about my pretend bluff here?

32
00:01:55.933 --> 00:01:58.366
I almost got drummed by you. If it doesn't work, it doesn't work.

33
00:01:58.366 --> 00:02:00.300
Don't hold on hard, haha.

34
00:02:02.866 --> 00:02:05.166
The little girl is too slow to eat steamed buns

35
00:02:05.333 --> 00:02:06.500
Drink glucose directly

36
00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:08.500
Spit out your strength.

37
00:02:08.666 --> 00:02:10.800
I tell you trash is trash

38
00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.000
You can't even give him gasoline

39
00:02:13.466 --> 00:02:14.966
So boring

40
00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:16.900
Damn wasting my temper

41
00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.166
Hmm, let's go

42
00:02:21.133 --> 00:02:21.966
Come on.

43
00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.200
I am not reconciled

44
00:02:36.466 --> 00:02:38.466
It shouldn't be like this

45
00:02:39.866 --> 00:02:40.966
My aunt

46
00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:42.633
Fourth uncle

47
00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:47.866
Uncle Six and the others sell coolies for me to compete

48
00:02:48.466 --> 00:02:51.600
Young people really don't know the sky is high and the earth is thick

49
00:02:51.933 --> 00:02:53.300
I thought I could eat

50
00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:55.800
You are eligible to be in the limelight at the Olympic trials

51
00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:56.666
So boring

52
00:02:56.666 --> 00:02:59.000
Why are there so many people who are not self-aware?

53
00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.466
I am not reconciled

54
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.366
I am not reconciled

55
00:03:09.866 --> 00:03:11.166
I am not reconciled

56
00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:15.866
He made it.

57
00:03:15.966 --> 00:03:17.400
Grab 200kg

58
00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.400
Keep adding weight, I'm fine.

59
00:03:26.266 --> 00:03:27.233
2.10 million

60
00:03:29.466 --> 00:03:30.833
220 kg

61
00:03:32.466 --> 00:03:33.833
230 kg

62
00:03:34.533 --> 00:03:36.166
240 kg

63
00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:38.566
250 kg

64
00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:42.900
This little body

65
00:03:43.166 --> 00:03:44.800
250 kg

66
00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:47.166
Smell him for you

67
00:03:47.166 --> 00:03:48.800
Set a world record
