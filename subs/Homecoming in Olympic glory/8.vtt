1
00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:03.233
Democratic Jianguo, as I said

2
00:00:03.333 --> 00:00:05.600
I don't accept moral kidnapping

3
00:00:05.733 --> 00:00:07.100
I also said

4
00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:09.133
A poor man's bone.

5
00:00:09.133 --> 00:00:13.033
Just kneel down and apologize

6
00:00:13.266 --> 00:00:15.400
If everyone were like you

7
00:00:15.466 --> 00:00:17.800
Kowtow and apologize and take it

8
00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.866
How can there be such a good thing?

9
00:00:20.666 --> 00:00:22.300
Long meaning, right?

10
00:00:24.566 --> 00:00:26.500
Good leader

11
00:00:26.866 --> 00:00:30.766
As long as you don't take me to erase my daughter's innocence

12
00:00:30.966 --> 00:00:33.766
And let's check the grades today

13
00:00:34.466 --> 00:00:35.633
Let you wait for me

14
00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.000
Let me do anything

15
00:00:38.333 --> 00:00:39.800
Anything will do.

16
00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:42.200
OK

17
00:00:43.533 --> 00:00:48.033
Then I will ask that you are a clan law

18
00:00:50.133 --> 00:00:52.400
Sea of swords and fire

19
00:00:52.733 --> 00:00:55.966
Lin Jianguo, if you can hold on

20
00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.300
It means that your ancestors are helping you

21
00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.033
I won't say anything.

22
00:01:00.066 --> 00:01:01.833
If you can't stand it

23
00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:04.066
Then life and death

24
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:05.700
Can't blame others

25
00:01:11.566 --> 00:01:12.466
I accept

26
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Dad, you are not in good health

27
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.633
That sea of swords and fire will kill people

28
00:01:18.766 --> 00:01:22.033
No, I don't firmly disagree with letting you go

29
00:01:23.133 --> 00:01:25.400
It doesn't matter if we make us emperor

30
00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.633
It doesn't matter if you don't let me check the car records

31
00:01:27.866 --> 00:01:29.900
I had no reputation

32
00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:31.700
I don't want anything.

33
00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.766
Let's go now

34
00:01:35.666 --> 00:01:37.100
Dad can't do it

35
00:01:37.266 --> 00:01:38.600
Didn't make any money

36
00:01:39.266 --> 00:01:42.666
Cowardice made you suffer for me

37
00:01:44.266 --> 00:01:45.200
You are still young

38
00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.266
Maybe you don't know what 1 million means

39
00:01:49.533 --> 00:01:52.633
There are a lot of people who never make 1 million

40
00:01:53.066 --> 00:01:55.066
Dad must help you get it

41
00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:57.966
Father in the world

42
00:01:58.133 --> 00:02:00.666
Who wouldn't want their daughter to have a better life?

43
00:02:01.533 --> 00:02:03.066
Dad can hold on

44
00:02:03.933 --> 00:02:04.766
village chief

45
00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.000
Shangjia law

46
00:02:07.566 --> 00:02:10.000
Sea of swords and fire

47
00:02:14.366 --> 00:02:15.566
Miezurezong

48
00:02:15.566 --> 00:02:16.466
on

49
00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:21.566
Lin Jianguo, the 77th generation descendant of the Yin family

50
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.033
Cultivating the wicked is stable

51
00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.066
Moral corruption

52
00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:28.766
Man and God are angry

53
00:02:29.333 --> 00:02:32.566
The new ancestral family law

54
00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.466
With filial piety

55
00:02:35.933 --> 00:02:39.400
Lin Jianguo Shangdao Mountain

56
00:02:41.533 --> 00:02:44.066
Village Chief, don't let my father be subject to family law

57
00:02:44.066 --> 00:02:47.400
We're not going in, we're not going to private him, village chief

58
00:02:47.866 --> 00:02:49.966
Please add ancestors

59
00:02:50.366 --> 00:02:51.900
What a big deal

60
00:02:52.166 --> 00:02:55.366
Did you think I was kidding you?

61
00:02:55.733 --> 00:02:56.900
Pull me away

62
00:02:57.266 --> 00:03:02.233
Dad don't go dad dad I don't want to

63
00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:04.033
No.

64
00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.833
Dad, don't go anymore dad

65
00:03:18.066 --> 00:03:21.633
Dad don't want me, don't go anymore

66
00:03:22.333 --> 00:03:23.133
Dad?

67
00:03:23.966 --> 00:03:30.900
Ahhhhhh

68
00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:46.366
Uh-huh.

69
00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.233
Uh-huh.

70
00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:56.500
Something big happened to the leader

71
00:03:56.666 --> 00:03:58.233
What could be big?

72
00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.933
The results of the Olympic trials are in

73
00:04:00.933 --> 00:04:03.366
Here comes the weightlifting program in our province

74
00:04:03.366 --> 00:04:04.900
Here comes a genius who breaks the Olympic record

75
00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:05.966
In Beiyang City

76
00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:08.200
Little sister reluctant to part

77
00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:09.700
Breaking Olympic records

78
00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:14.666
Quickly call Beiyang TV Yes

79
00:04:20.733 --> 00:04:21.533
What!

80
00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:24.833
The genius who broke the Olympic record appeared

81
00:04:24.933 --> 00:04:26.400
In we are

82
00:04:29.166 --> 00:04:31.866
What a world record-breaking genius

83
00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.166
In our county

84
00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:34.900
Hello

85
00:04:35.133 --> 00:04:35.966
What!

86
00:04:36.466 --> 00:04:39.300
The genius who broke the record for staying up late is with us

87
00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:40.466
Right in Linjia Village

88
00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.366
Little plum, hurry up, hurry up

89
00:04:45.366 --> 00:04:46.766
Bring my old three

90
00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:48.600
Arrive at Linjiacun within 10 minutes

91
00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:49.066
Us?

92
00:04:49.066 --> 00:04:51.233
You must be the first to see this precious genius

93
00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:52.200
Go go go

94
00:04:54.366 --> 00:04:55.266
Ah!

95
00:05:01.466 --> 00:05:02.266
Ah!

96
00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:03.633
Yeah.

97
00:05:04.166 --> 00:05:05.500
We can hold on

98
00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:08.433
Lin Jianguo, don't play dead!

99
00:05:08.566 --> 00:05:10.333
It's not over yet

100
00:05:10.333 --> 00:05:12.033
If you have the guts, stand up for me

101
00:05:12.066 --> 00:05:13.700
I'm going for my dad

102
00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:16.400
Halfway through the addition

103
00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:18.266
How can there be a replacement knife?

104
00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:20.200
Hold him down for me

105
00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:29.866
Lin Jianguo, have you ever been in this sea of fire?

106
00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:36.200
Dad?

107
00:05:36.933 --> 00:05:39.566
Captain, I have passed this knife mountain

108
00:05:39.666 --> 00:05:42.466
If I go through this sea of fire again

109
00:05:42.933 --> 00:05:46.400
Please help my daughter wash her body

110
00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:48.666
Let him get the treatment he deserves

111
00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:53.166
So much crap.

112
00:05:53.166 --> 00:05:54.233
Let's go

113
00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:00.300
Dad?

114
00:06:02.333 --> 00:06:04.833
Dad, don't scare me

115
00:06:05.166 --> 00:06:09.166
Didn't you say you wanted to fuck me?

116
00:06:09.933 --> 00:06:12.400
Lin Wenwen is still talking big here

117
00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:16.433
I am the only one who can make the Lin family shine

118
00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:18.366
I am the Nine Heavens True Dragon

119
00:06:18.533 --> 00:06:23.000
You're just a stinky area in a cesspool

120
00:06:23.066 --> 00:06:24.800
You're still overreaching here

121
00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:26.166
I'll tell you what.

122
00:06:26.266 --> 00:06:28.300
If you can give the Lin family glory

123
00:06:29.066 --> 00:06:30.966
Me and my dad and my mom

124
00:06:31.066 --> 00:06:33.233
Right here, up the mountain of knives and down the sea of fire

125
00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:34.900
Wu Jianlong

126
00:06:35.266 --> 00:06:36.966
Don't play dead.

127
00:06:37.366 --> 00:06:38.766
Kind of stand up

128
00:06:38.766 --> 00:06:40.600
This sea of fire is not over yet

129
00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:44.266
Big event!

130
00:06:44.266 --> 00:06:45.766
The great event

131
00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:49.800
Someone in our village is on the shortlist for the Olympics
