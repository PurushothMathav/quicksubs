00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:08.766
Classmate Lin Uncle Lin

2
00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.333
You go to the lobby and wait a moment

3
00:00:10.333 --> 00:00:11.700
I have notified Mr. Yang.

4
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.166
He'll come pick you up in person

5
00:00:14.166 --> 00:00:15.266
Thank you Secretary Zhang

6
00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:25.100
Let's go down the mountain and sit for a while

7
00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:30.266
Ouch, look at this coffee table

8
00:00:30.566 --> 00:00:31.266
Huang Liang

9
00:00:31.266 --> 00:00:33.200
Can see my face

10
00:00:33.333 --> 00:00:34.966
So beautiful oops

11
00:00:34.966 --> 00:00:38.600
Why can't I wipe this kind of table?

12
00:00:38.733 --> 00:00:41.966
Don't wipe it, we can't afford to break it.

13
00:00:47.666 --> 00:00:49.200
What are you doing?

14
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:49.800
cut

15
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.866
Is that all you can do? Get out! Get up!

16
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.100
Come on! What are you doing?

17
00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.333
I said where did the sour taste come from?

18
00:00:58.333 --> 00:00:59.500
Here's the result.

19
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.000
Yunting Hotel is also where you came from

20
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.533
Sister-in-law, so you are the lobby manager here?

21
00:01:06.533 --> 00:01:07.666
Who is your sister-in-law?

22
00:01:07.666 --> 00:01:08.866
Don't mistake relatives

23
00:01:08.866 --> 00:01:11.000
My sister has been taking you off for years

24
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.566
Why can't I live?

25
00:01:12.566 --> 00:01:14.566
Come to me to beg for food

26
00:01:14.866 --> 00:01:16.366
We're not here to beg

27
00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.700
I haven't seen my ex-niece in so many years

28
00:01:19.733 --> 00:01:22.566
It's still the same mud that can't hold up the wall

29
00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:25.300
A cripple

30
00:01:25.533 --> 00:01:26.400
kick out

31
00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:28.366
We're not here to make trouble.

32
00:01:28.366 --> 00:01:30.900
We were invited to the Olympic Implementation Conference

33
00:01:30.966 --> 00:01:32.600
Hahahaha

34
00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.000
Olympic Implementation Conference

35
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.166
Do you know what the Olympics are?
