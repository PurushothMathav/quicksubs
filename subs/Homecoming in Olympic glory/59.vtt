00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.466
Ahahaha

2
00:00:02.466 --> 00:00:04.800
You broke the world record

3
00:00:05.166 --> 00:00:09.233
That's right, Wenwen broke the world record

4
00:00:10.166 --> 00:00:14.033
Lin Jianguo, you are still talking nonsense here

5
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:15.900
Lao Tzu is a hero and a hero

6
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.466
Lao Tzu is a bear and a waste

7
00:00:17.466 --> 00:00:18.966
Just a trash like you

8
00:00:18.966 --> 00:00:20.800
What good seedlings can be cultivated?

9
00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.666
And the face to pretend to be cool here

10
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.166
I tell you the truth

11
00:00:24.333 --> 00:00:26.566
Lin Yaozu is my younger brother, do you know?

12
00:00:26.566 --> 00:00:28.233
Just your confidence

13
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.566
I already knew it clearly

14
00:00:30.566 --> 00:00:32.266
Don't make me angry here

15
00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.633
How are you? You mother and son are really

16
00:00:37.933 --> 00:00:41.000
It's not that the whole family doesn't enter the door.

17
00:00:41.466 --> 00:00:43.033
The same ignorance

18
00:00:43.266 --> 00:00:44.800
self-righteous

19
00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.666
I think I'm right

20
00:00:46.966 --> 00:00:49.800
You are full of nonsense

21
00:00:49.966 --> 00:00:50.733
You for a while

22
00:00:50.733 --> 00:00:52.666
Say this 200 million order because you have it

23
00:00:52.666 --> 00:00:55.133
After a while, he said that this new-style conference is because of you

24
00:00:55.133 --> 00:00:57.333
Yes, you are just talking

25
00:00:57.333 --> 00:00:58.433
disgusting

26
00:00:58.733 --> 00:01:00.766
How could I have a daughter like you?

27
00:01:00.766 --> 00:01:03.200
You are the biggest stain on my life

28
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.233
Giving birth to me was the greatest blessing of your life

29
00:01:09.466 --> 00:01:11.466
I remember this sentence

30
00:01:11.733 --> 00:01:14.466
I hope you don't regret it in your life.

31
00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:16.300
Ah!

32
00:01:17.566 --> 00:01:18.900
Check my loan and pay it back to me

33
00:01:19.733 --> 00:01:20.633
What else

34
00:01:20.733 --> 00:01:22.466
What will I pay you back, you thief?

35
00:01:23.166 --> 00:01:24.700
So watch this.

36
00:01:24.933 --> 00:01:27.800
This is the barbell that Mr. Yang specially customized for us.

37
00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.500
Necklaces to encourage us to prepare for the Olympics

38
00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:31.866
value daughter

39
00:01:31.866 --> 00:01:33.033
Extravagant

40
00:01:33.466 --> 00:01:36.200
He can't have it
