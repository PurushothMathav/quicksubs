00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:01.900
Mr. Yang is busy every day

2
00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:04.000
I don't have time to deal with this little guy

3
00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:07.300
But I know it with my toes.

4
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.466
He stole the necklace.

5
00:00:09.466 --> 00:00:10.066
Hahaha

6
00:00:10.066 --> 00:00:14.233
It's you, a rubbish school rubbish coach

7
00:00:14.466 --> 00:00:16.633
Trash athlete brought out

8
00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.000
Why should Mr. Yang give you such a valuable thing?

9
00:00:20.166 --> 00:00:23.800
That's right, the upper beam is not right and the lower beam is crooked

10
00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.500
Old trash loves to brag

11
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.000
Little vanity

12
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.300
Satisfy your needs by stealing

13
00:00:29.466 --> 00:00:32.800
It's really not that the whole family doesn't enter the same door, right?

14
00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.100
This family of trash

15
00:00:34.133 --> 00:00:37.166
Hahaha well said

16
00:00:37.333 --> 00:00:40.500
It's not that a family doesn't enter a house

17
00:00:41.166 --> 00:00:44.700
Your whole family depends on how high and low people are

18
00:00:44.866 --> 00:00:46.433
appearance identity

19
00:00:46.866 --> 00:00:49.433
Right and wrong is right and wrong

20
00:00:49.866 --> 00:00:53.766
You are so brainless and indifferent

21
00:00:53.966 --> 00:00:56.433
People who look down on people

22
00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.200
I have nothing to say.

23
00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.433
Don't talk about high-sounding here

24
00:01:01.533 --> 00:01:03.966
I've seen a lot of people like you

25
00:01:03.966 --> 00:01:07.500
Don't you just feel guilty and want to jump over the wall and bite me?

26
00:01:07.666 --> 00:01:08.900
I'll tell you what.

27
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.666
I'm not as good-natured as Comet

28
00:01:11.666 --> 00:01:14.566
Piss me off, I want you to die

29
00:01:15.133 --> 00:01:15.966
security guard

30
00:01:16.166 --> 00:01:18.566
Throw these poor things out to me

31
00:01:18.566 --> 00:01:19.866
Disobedient words

32
00:01:20.166 --> 00:01:22.366
Broken leg mighty dog part

33
00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:24.500
And so forth.

34
00:01:30.266 --> 00:01:31.100
I can prove it.

35
00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.466
This necklace was given to Lin Wenwen by Mr. Yang

36
00:01:34.466 --> 00:01:35.800
I saw it with my own eyes

37
00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.700
Whelan, are you saying

38
00:01:39.066 --> 00:01:41.466
This is a gift from Mr. Yang himself

39
00:01:42.933 --> 00:01:45.600
Hey, is this losing money?

40
00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.800
Really breaking the world record
