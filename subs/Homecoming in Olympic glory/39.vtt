00:00:00.466 --> 00:00:02.800
Do you know how much 200 million is?

2
00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:05.100
It's money you can't earn in ten lifetimes

3
00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.600
I can kill you with money

4
00:00:07.866 --> 00:00:10.433
What if Aotian is not my biological?

5
00:00:10.466 --> 00:00:11.900
He can bring me

6
00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:14.400
It's a lot more than that losing money.

7
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.866
I'm not just a billionaire now

8
00:00:17.866 --> 00:00:21.300
And the mother of a future Olympic champion

9
00:00:21.333 --> 00:00:23.566
Aotian can make me famous and rich

10
00:00:23.566 --> 00:00:25.400
But you can ask the money-losing product.

11
00:00:25.533 --> 00:00:26.700
He is nothing but my biological daughter

12
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:28.433
What can he bring me?

13
00:00:28.933 --> 00:00:32.533
Chang Aotian Chang Aotian is nothing

14
00:00:32.533 --> 00:00:34.866
We broke the world record

15
00:00:38.333 --> 00:00:40.200
How can the world be so cold?

16
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.866
Ruthless mother

17
00:00:43.166 --> 00:00:44.800
Ah, never mind.

18
00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.533
I never treated him anyway

19
00:00:46.533 --> 00:00:48.166
Have any illusions

20
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.700
Daughter dad sorry for you

21
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.200
Dad is not capable

22
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.600
That's why you're being bullied with your dad

23
00:00:54.766 --> 00:00:56.833
Dad, don't say that

24
00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:59.300
If your leg hadn't been injured in the first place

25
00:00:59.333 --> 00:01:01.266
You must be doing well now.

26
00:01:01.266 --> 00:01:03.166
Even coaching the national team

27
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.466
That woman wouldn't dare to do that to you

28
00:01:06.766 --> 00:01:10.233
Forget it, forget about the past

29
00:01:10.333 --> 00:01:11.133
text

30
00:01:11.966 --> 00:01:13.500
Although your mother

31
00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.866
But I still want to give it to your grandma

32
00:01:19.066 --> 00:01:21.033
And give your uncle a call

33
00:01:21.133 --> 00:01:22.633
Let them know

34
00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:26.066
Lest they say we have no manners?

35
00:01:26.266 --> 00:01:27.866
I'm fine
