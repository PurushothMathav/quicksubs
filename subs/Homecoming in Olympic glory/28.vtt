00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:06.200
An average is just a waste rice bucket

2
00:00:06.666 --> 00:00:07.000
bitch

3
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.733
Suddenly a genius for breaking world champions

4
00:00:09.733 --> 00:00:12.200
Hey, think about it with your pig brains

5
00:00:12.266 --> 00:00:13.566
Is that reasonable?

6
00:00:13.566 --> 00:00:15.000
Can anyone prove it?

7
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.600
The town leader you just mentioned

8
00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:18.933
County leaders City leaders

9
00:00:18.933 --> 00:00:21.100
Provincial leaders are coming

10
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:22.933
Want me to see you two

11
00:00:22.933 --> 00:00:24.800
Maybe he did something shady

12
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.966
Maybe it's the result of your own persuasion

13
00:00:27.666 --> 00:00:28.600
Ah, yes, yes.

14
00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:29.700
My mom was right

15
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:31.433
There's definitely something wrong with this.

16
00:00:31.566 --> 00:00:33.666
Otherwise, the two of them cheated.

17
00:00:33.666 --> 00:00:36.200
Otherwise, this broken machine is broken.

18
00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.166
Lin Wenwen, you trash

19
00:00:41.166 --> 00:00:42.700
How could you possibly break the world record?

20
00:00:42.766 --> 00:00:45.700
Is it so hard for the Lin Demon Clan to admit that others are excellent?

21
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.200
You look like a jumping clown

22
00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:49.000
you

23
00:00:50.466 --> 00:00:52.400
How dare you, Lin Yaozu?

24
00:00:53.333 --> 00:00:55.766
Lin Wenwen is a genius who broke the world record

25
00:00:55.966 --> 00:00:58.400
National selected key players

26
00:00:58.600 --> 00:00:59.900
How dare you touch him

27
00:01:00.133 --> 00:01:01.600
Believe it or not, I'll call the police right away

28
00:01:01.966 --> 00:01:04.433
Immediately arrest you and put you in prison for a few years

29
00:01:04.533 --> 00:01:06.466
I bah Lin Wenwen

30
00:01:06.533 --> 00:01:08.066
Lin Wenwen is a stupid pig

31
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.166
How could it be the day that broke the world record?

32
00:01:10.166 --> 00:01:11.966
Let me tell you

33
00:01:11.966 --> 00:01:13.400
There's something wrong with this.

34
00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.000
Don't believe him, don't be deceived by him
