00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.533
Because he is what he is?

2
00:00:03.533 --> 00:00:05.533
Poor jingle at home

3
00:00:05.533 --> 00:00:08.300
I advise you who have neither money nor talent

4
00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:09.733
So let's not think about it.

5
00:00:09.733 --> 00:00:11.100
Go home and farm

6
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:13.400
Emperor, you are also a farmer for three generations

7
00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.100
Why look down on rural people?

8
00:00:15.733 --> 00:00:16.766
That's different.

9
00:00:16.766 --> 00:00:19.333
I am now the lobby manager of Yunting Hotel

10
00:00:19.333 --> 00:00:21.700
White collar as you said

11
00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:24.300
For tens of thousands of years on the Internet, everyone is still a monkey

12
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.000
Oops, okay, don't give me these useless things

13
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.200
Poor is poor

14
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.366
Look for reasons in yourself

15
00:00:30.366 --> 00:00:31.500
Why are you poor?

16
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.966
It's not because you didn't work hard enough

17
00:00:33.966 --> 00:00:36.566
Don't keep thinking about taking advantage of others, okay?

18
00:00:36.566 --> 00:00:37.866
We are poor

19
00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:39.666
But we are poor and have backbone

20
00:00:39.966 --> 00:00:41.266
We didn't steal or rob

21
00:00:41.266 --> 00:00:44.066
There is no shame in making money with your own hands

22
00:00:44.266 --> 00:00:47.000
On the other hand, auntie, you rely on relationships to rise

23
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.066
Don't be ashamed, be proud

24
00:00:49.966 --> 00:00:51.433
Again.

25
00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:57.766
I see.

26
00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:00.100
Sister Nan

27
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.900
I know why these poor mountain people are talking here

28
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.066
The Olympic World Congress was held in our Yunting Hotel

29
00:01:07.066 --> 00:01:08.800
This has been leaked

30
00:01:08.866 --> 00:01:11.366
Lots of idle people trying to get in

31
00:01:11.566 --> 00:01:13.400
The largest leading group in our province

32
00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:14.266
Benchmarking Media

33
00:01:14.266 --> 00:01:16.033
Well-known companies will come

34
00:01:16.066 --> 00:01:19.133
This group of poor and sour goods must be trying to take advantage of the reporters

35
00:01:19.133 --> 00:01:20.566
Shameless begging

36
00:01:21.066 --> 00:01:23.333
People were kidnapped by morality and had to donate money to him

37
00:01:23.333 --> 00:01:24.600
They would think

38
00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:25.333
This way

39
00:01:25.333 --> 00:01:27.500
No better than going to the street to bask in the wind and sun

40
00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:28.633
Come quickly

41
00:01:29.133 --> 00:01:31.566
It's really poor and bad

42
00:01:31.566 --> 00:01:33.800
I actually thought of coming to the World Affairs Conference

43
00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.900
Get up with such a shameless practice

44
00:01:35.933 --> 00:01:36.666
Okay.

45
00:01:36.666 --> 00:01:40.166
I don't have time to waste time here and ask you for money, do I?

46
00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.200
Take it and roll

47
00:01:42.733 --> 00:01:44.300
We don't need your charity

48
00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.666
Toast without eating and being fined?

49
00:01:46.766 --> 00:01:48.366
Get me out
