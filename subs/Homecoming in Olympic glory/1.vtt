1
00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.766
Lao Li, your uremia has reached the middle stage

2
00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:07.800
If you don't go to the big hospital in the provincial capital for good treatment

3
00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:10.966
Your life is gone

4
00:00:15.766 --> 00:00:17.000
Dear villagers

5
00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.933
The quadrennial Olympic trials

6
00:00:19.933 --> 00:00:22.433
It will start in a week.

7
00:00:22.466 --> 00:00:25.833
Our village is a strong sports village

8
00:00:25.933 --> 00:00:28.000
The big boss in the provincial capital speaks

9
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.200
If you go out, you can enter the Olympics

10
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.066
shortlist of contestants

11
00:00:33.066 --> 00:00:36.033
Bonus 1 million

12
00:00:36.866 --> 00:00:39.066
It's time for another year of the Olympics.

13
00:00:39.066 --> 00:00:43.600
The girl walked the Shili Mountain Road to fetch water

14
00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.600
It also weighs more than 100 catties.

15
00:00:45.766 --> 00:00:46.966
Are you exhausted?

16
00:00:46.966 --> 00:00:49.366
The steamed buns are just steamed, hurry up and eat them.

17
00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.233
It's all Dad's inability

18
00:01:03.466 --> 00:01:07.266
I didn't find a profitable career after retiring from injuries

19
00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.000
Let you follow me to eat bran throat vegetables

20
00:01:10.366 --> 00:01:11.766
What's wrong with making soup and vegetables?

21
00:01:11.766 --> 00:01:13.500
How well my dad raised me

22
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.600
Well, look at you, you rice bucket

23
00:01:16.666 --> 00:01:19.233
It looks disgusting and smelly

24
00:01:23.733 --> 00:01:24.766
Lin Jianguo

25
00:01:24.766 --> 00:01:26.666
Your sister-in-law and I are here today

26
00:01:26.666 --> 00:01:27.966
It's about the money

27
00:01:28.533 --> 00:01:29.400
money

28
00:01:30.166 --> 00:01:32.700
Brother, when I retired from injury

29
00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.666
The team gave me 10,000 yuan in pension

30
00:01:34.866 --> 00:01:36.366
You borrowed it for 20 years

31
00:01:36.366 --> 00:01:38.400
You're finally going to pay me back now, aren't you?

32
00:01:40.933 --> 00:01:43.266
Didn't I just lend you 10,000 yuan?

33
00:01:43.266 --> 00:01:44.600
eldest brother as father

34
00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:45.800
Mother-in-law

35
00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:47.966
What's wrong with your money?

36
00:01:47.966 --> 00:01:50.500
What was the concept of 10,000 yuan 20 years ago?

37
00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.966
If my dad hadn't lent you the money

38
00:01:52.966 --> 00:01:54.700
You start your own business.

39
00:01:55.066 --> 00:01:57.200
It must be much better than now

40
00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:58.966
Maybe you still look up to him

41
00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.000
Adults don't talk like you, the rice bucket who interrupts

42
00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:04.466
I'll just say it

43
00:02:04.566 --> 00:02:06.466
The team is going to participate in the Olympic selection

44
00:02:06.866 --> 00:02:07.666
Of course you did.

45
00:02:07.666 --> 00:02:09.033
Gotta show it

46
00:02:09.266 --> 00:02:10.066
Not much.

47
00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:12.800
I'll take 2,000 bucks, not too much

48
00:02:12.866 --> 00:02:15.500
2,000 bucks? That's killing me!

49
00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.233
Besides, I still want money

50
00:02:18.566 --> 00:02:21.933
Let Wenwen participate in the Olympic trials?

51
00:02:21.933 --> 00:02:24.000
He's trying out for the Olympics.

52
00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.166
What's the use of cultivating such a rice bucket?

53
00:02:26.166 --> 00:02:27.066
No matter how well trained

54
00:02:27.066 --> 00:02:30.100
Married people are also the head of the family

55
00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.900
I was also trained as a child

56
00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.900
I learned weightlifting in the provincial team

57
00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:37.900
He was discharged from prison.

58
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.133
I just came to the village and became a free coach

59
00:02:41.133 --> 00:02:42.366
Our Neighborhood Village

60
00:02:42.566 --> 00:02:45.200
It has become a famous sports village in the province

61
00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.133
What do you mean, our family is the main one?

62
00:02:48.133 --> 00:02:50.666
Our whole family is grateful to you

63
00:02:50.666 --> 00:02:52.800
Did I not mean that?

64
00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.400
I mean the 2,000 bucks

65
00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.333
The icing on the cake for you

66
00:02:57.333 --> 00:02:59.033
But for us

67
00:02:59.533 --> 00:03:02.333
That's all we have.

68
00:03:02.333 --> 00:03:05.000
Who has seen me and found that you are really not a thing

69
00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.400
I actually put it here

70
00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:08.100
If you ask for money

71
00:03:08.133 --> 00:03:11.000
When you want to ask for the light, or if it's gone, you can still read your kindness.

72
00:03:11.133 --> 00:03:12.166
If you don't give

73
00:03:12.166 --> 00:03:14.333
From now on, we are enemies

74
00:03:14.333 --> 00:03:15.466
Don't communicate in this life

75
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.466
I'll get it myself

76
00:03:18.566 --> 00:03:19.900
Sister-in-law

77
00:03:21.566 --> 00:03:22.833
Are you all right?

78
00:03:26.733 --> 00:03:28.033
Big brother and sister-in-law

79
00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:29.733
I'm fine

80
00:03:29.733 --> 00:03:31.600
How do you let Wenwen live?

81
00:03:32.866 --> 00:03:35.600
Lin Jianguo, I advise you, Lao Tzu clearly knows

82
00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:38.566
Marry this rice bucket off early in exchange for some bride price.

83
00:03:38.566 --> 00:03:41.700
So that our medical team can participate in the Olympic selection

84
00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:42.333
At that time

85
00:03:42.333 --> 00:03:44.533
You have an Olympic nephew

86
00:03:44.533 --> 00:03:46.800
Can't you tell who is lighter and who is heavier?

87
00:03:46.933 --> 00:03:49.566
No wonder your whole village is the worst

88
00:03:50.766 --> 00:03:52.400
A crippled rice bucket

89
00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:53.966
Deserve to be poor for a lifetime
