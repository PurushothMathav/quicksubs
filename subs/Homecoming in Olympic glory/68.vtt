00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:03.200
Mom, this is not my fault.

2
00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:05.500
Didn't you hear what Mr. Yang said just now?

3
00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:09.100
I was rewarded because of my precious son.

4
00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:10.300
Let me see.

5
00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:13.400
Today's greatest hero is Aotian

6
00:00:13.733 --> 00:00:16.966
Son, you have given your father face today

7
00:00:16.966 --> 00:00:19.500
You are awesome, mom and dad

8
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.900
Well, you used to shelter me from the wind and rain

9
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.666
From now on, I will be your solid backing

10
00:00:24.666 --> 00:00:27.366
A son is a mother's pride

11
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:28.666
Do you see it?

12
00:00:28.666 --> 00:00:32.200
My son is handsome, sensible and capable.

13
00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.333
Where are you ugly and ignorant

14
00:00:34.333 --> 00:00:35.733
The lowly poor students can force it

15
00:00:35.733 --> 00:00:37.700
Pretend to be some big shot for me here

16
00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:40.033
Hmph, it turns off your appetite when you see it.

17
00:00:40.466 --> 00:00:42.366
Dragon begets dragon and phoenix begets phoenix

18
00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.266
Rats make holes.

19
00:00:44.733 --> 00:00:46.000
lose money

20
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.300
Hey, you are doomed to be a waste in your life

21
00:00:49.466 --> 00:00:53.766
Wimp even if I am a wimp wimp

22
00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.700
More selfish than your family

23
00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:58.066
hold high and mine low

24
00:00:58.066 --> 00:00:59.766
It's good to see different thoughts

25
00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:01.633
Shut up

26
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.866
Even now, you're still giving me excuses

27
00:01:03.866 --> 00:01:04.933
Nonsense

28
00:01:04.933 --> 00:01:06.900
You are just mud and can't support the wall

29
00:01:07.366 --> 00:01:09.066
You still want to be a champion

30
00:01:09.066 --> 00:01:11.200
I see you dream

31
00:01:11.466 --> 00:01:13.066
I said so much

32
00:01:13.533 --> 00:01:15.700
Why don't you believe me yet?

33
00:01:15.866 --> 00:01:19.300
You are more than I am the biological daughter you conceived in October

34
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.566
He is just your disciple

35
00:01:21.733 --> 00:01:23.400
Why would you rather believe him?

36
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.700
I don't want to believe my own daughter

37
00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:27.966
What about biological?

38
00:01:27.966 --> 00:01:30.033
What about non-biological ones?

39
00:01:30.066 --> 00:01:33.133
He can win the championship and get 200 million order for me

40
00:01:33.133 --> 00:01:34.200
3 good gifts

41
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.766
Even if he's not my biological son

42
00:01:36.766 --> 00:01:40.200
I still love him as my own son

43
00:01:40.466 --> 00:01:42.933
And you look ugly

44
00:01:42.933 --> 00:01:44.133
Dirty mind

45
00:01:44.133 --> 00:01:45.933
Even if you have my blood on you

46
00:01:45.933 --> 00:01:47.700
I don't want to blame you, my daughter.

47
00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.133
You will never give birth

48
00:01:49.133 --> 00:01:50.766
You don't have your daughter
