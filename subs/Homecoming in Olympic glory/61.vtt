00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:02.466
You, you stinky beggars

2
00:00:02.466 --> 00:00:04.266
You're with these two losers

3
00:00:04.266 --> 00:00:06.266
So you can't be trusted.

4
00:00:06.266 --> 00:00:07.500
I'm too lazy to tell you so much.

5
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:08.000
security guard

6
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.266
Hurry up and drag this poor product out for me

7
00:00:10.333 --> 00:00:11.533
I didn't steal it

8
00:00:11.533 --> 00:00:14.166
If you don't believe me, you can call and ask Mr. Yang

9
00:00:14.166 --> 00:00:15.000
Just ask

10
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:15.800
This one?

11
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:19.233
Poor goods like you also match JD.com lady

12
00:00:21.966 --> 00:00:25.166
Husband, you are finally here

13
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.133
Mr. Yang will accompany the leader for a while

14
00:00:27.133 --> 00:00:29.166
It will come down when the opening ceremony starts

15
00:00:29.766 --> 00:00:32.366
However, Mr. Yang still had foresight

16
00:00:32.366 --> 00:00:34.366
Let me come down and check first

17
00:00:34.366 --> 00:00:36.566
See if there is a patrol posture

18
00:00:36.566 --> 00:00:38.433
Those who disrupt the order of the conference

19
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.300
Husband, let me tell you

20
00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.566
Hurry up and poke these poor goods out

21
00:00:42.566 --> 00:00:43.600
Clean up

22
00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.066
Save it, he's getting in our way here

23
00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:47.100
you

24
00:00:47.666 --> 00:00:49.466
So poisonous and illiterate

25
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.666
You let this wild man

26
00:00:51.766 --> 00:00:53.466
Teach your own daughter a lesson

27
00:00:53.466 --> 00:00:55.866
Are you not afraid of five thunderbolts?

28
00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.533
I haven't been in front of so many people in front of the comet

29
00:00:59.533 --> 00:01:02.066
Teaching you a lesson is enough to give you face

30
00:01:02.066 --> 00:01:03.466
Don't be ignorant

31
00:01:04.333 --> 00:01:05.566
Now get out of here

32
00:01:05.566 --> 00:01:07.166
I just turn a blind eye

33
00:01:07.333 --> 00:01:09.766
Or I'll send you to the well rats

34
00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.200
Let you suffer for a lifetime

35
00:01:12.666 --> 00:01:14.833
This was given to me by Mr. Yang himself

36
00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.700
Which law am I breaking for receiving gifts?

37
00:01:17.733 --> 00:01:19.200
Which law was violated?

38
00:01:19.866 --> 00:01:22.300
If you don't believe me, you can ask Mr. Yang.

39
00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.700
Don't settle cases on whims here
