00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.400
Are you sure this 200 million

2
00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:03.666
The contract was won by your son

3
00:00:03.966 --> 00:00:07.000
Affirmation and affirmation

4
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.733
Secretary Zhang told me personally

5
00:00:08.733 --> 00:00:10.766
I brought out a major championship

6
00:00:10.766 --> 00:00:14.166
That's why I 200 million contract

7
00:00:14.533 --> 00:00:16.400
I am a mother who is worthy of children

8
00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:17.900
Wife depends on husband

9
00:00:18.066 --> 00:00:21.200
It really depends on people's length based on money

10
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.233
On the basis of status

11
00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.200
Fortunately, I didn't talk to you in the first place.

12
00:00:26.466 --> 00:00:29.366
Otherwise I would be like you

13
00:00:29.366 --> 00:00:32.266
It's a cold-blooded and selfish breakup

14
00:00:35.566 --> 00:00:37.466
What the hell are you talking to me about?

15
00:00:37.666 --> 00:00:40.666
I hit you to help you, to make you see reality

16
00:00:40.766 --> 00:00:42.133
I 200 million contract

17
00:00:42.133 --> 00:00:44.066
Not brought to me by my excellent son

18
00:00:44.066 --> 00:00:45.266
Is it you who lost money?

19
00:00:45.266 --> 00:00:47.233
The goods and you, the trash, brought it to me.

20
00:00:47.333 --> 00:00:49.666
It really made me laugh out loud.

21
00:00:50.266 --> 00:00:54.066
This 200 million order was indeed brought to you by me

22
00:00:54.266 --> 00:00:56.366
Otherwise, you think you don't have me.

23
00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.800
Can you get on the line with Mr. Yang?

24
00:00:59.933 --> 00:01:01.433
Wenwen is right

25
00:01:01.933 --> 00:01:05.066
Your scenery today is brought to you by Wenwen

26
00:01:05.066 --> 00:01:08.766
Liu Huixin, you are really blind

27
00:01:08.866 --> 00:01:11.366
You don't recognize such an excellent biological daughter

28
00:01:11.566 --> 00:01:14.800
You have to curry favor with someone else's son

29
00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:16.600
Shut up!

30
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.833
You women are shameless at home

31
00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.300
You gave me the contract

32
00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:26.033
Why don't you go to heaven

33
00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.000
You two didn't finish junior high school together.

34
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.400
I didn't finish high school.

35
00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:31.433
Two illiterate people

36
00:01:31.733 --> 00:01:33.100
Now run to me and tell me

37
00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:34.733
The 200 million contract was given to me by you.

38
00:01:34.733 --> 00:01:35.733
Let me ask you something.

39
00:01:35.733 --> 00:01:37.533
Do you know how to write these two billion?

40
00:01:37.533 --> 00:01:39.000
How many zeros are there after this billion?

41
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.266
And you know what?

42
00:01:40.466 --> 00:01:42.600
These two billion are your lifetime

43
00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.266
Money that you can't earn in eight lifetimes before and after the next life

44
00:01:45.366 --> 00:01:47.200
And told me shamelessly

45
00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.266
You gave me this contract

46
00:01:50.533 --> 00:01:53.600
I knew you were so selfish

47
00:01:53.866 --> 00:01:56.000
I will never let Mr. Yao get a visa with you

48
00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.100
200 million orders

49
00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.733
Haha, your eyes are addicted.

50
00:01:59.733 --> 00:02:02.466
Are you just swollen and fat?

51
00:02:02.933 --> 00:02:04.300
You are a rice bucket

52
00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:05.333
You are a salt

53
00:02:05.333 --> 00:02:09.300
A weak chicken rice bucket that can't grow at all

54
00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.500
Hahaha

55
00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.166
Ah!

56
00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.566
Ha, pay attention

57
00:02:15.666 --> 00:02:18.600
Stop talking to these two rubbish

58
00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.166
Get them out of here!

59
00:02:20.166 --> 00:02:20.566
Ouch.

60
00:02:20.566 --> 00:02:24.233
Save our family from being humiliating again.

61
00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.033
I'll count to three.

62
00:02:26.133 --> 00:02:28.166
Get the hell out of here

63
00:02:33.066 --> 00:02:35.600
Are you sure you want me to go?

64
00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:39.233
If I get out, this teacher-teacher conference doesn't need to be held

65
00:02:41.533 --> 00:02:42.966
Who is so cold

66
00:02:43.366 --> 00:02:45.200
But leave the rhetoric here
