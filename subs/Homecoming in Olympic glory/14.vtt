00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:01.666
Can you afford it?

2
00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:03.766
Village Chief, shut up

3
00:00:03.933 --> 00:00:05.400
Don't push your luck.

4
00:00:05.766 --> 00:00:07.566
Ten years.

5
00:00:08.133 --> 00:00:12.033
Lin Jiacun finally has a big hero

6
00:00:12.533 --> 00:00:15.500
Today is a great day for Yaozu

7
00:00:15.666 --> 00:00:18.900
I announce the official start of ancestor worship

8
00:00:18.966 --> 00:00:20.800
Celebrate Yaozu

9
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.700
Hahahahaha

10
00:00:25.766 --> 00:00:29.333
You two are still like a wooden stake

11
00:00:29.333 --> 00:00:30.766
What are you doing here?

12
00:00:30.766 --> 00:00:32.166
Get out of here

13
00:00:32.166 --> 00:00:33.400
Don't affect it, we'll all bake it.

14
00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:34.266
Move fast.

15
00:00:34.266 --> 00:00:35.700
Rush to Linjia Village

16
00:00:35.966 --> 00:00:38.166
The genius who broke the world record was in our county

17
00:00:38.166 --> 00:00:40.300
It is a blessing that our county has built for a hundred years

18
00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.766
We need to hurry up and visit the genius

19
00:00:42.766 --> 00:00:44.200
Don't neglect him

20
00:00:44.666 --> 00:00:46.700
And let the drumming team go ahead

21
00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:49.100
Be sure to give the foot genius the card face to go

22
00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.833
Banner up.

23
00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:00.366
The suona blows

24
00:01:00.366 --> 00:01:02.066
Dance for me

25
00:01:02.066 --> 00:01:05.400
Today we all go to Linjiang Village with me

26
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.833
Congratulations to the genius who broke the world record

27
00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.000
Are the gifts all together?

28
00:01:17.266 --> 00:01:18.866
Hurry up and go to Lijia Village

29
00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.100
You go you go

30
00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:30.433
There you go.

31
00:01:31.333 --> 00:01:32.733
You slander me

32
00:01:32.733 --> 00:01:34.300
It's okay to build my yellow kiln

33
00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:36.333
Now I'm going to prove my innocence

34
00:01:36.333 --> 00:01:37.900
Why don't you allow it?

35
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.500
You are the village chief

36
00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:40.933
highly respected

37
00:01:40.933 --> 00:01:43.466
Everyone should be treated fairly

38
00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.200
But you wronged me indiscriminately

39
00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.900
I'm not even given a chance to prove my innocence now

40
00:01:49.966 --> 00:01:52.966
People like you don't deserve to be the head of a village

41
00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.166
Who gave you the courage to talk to me like this?
