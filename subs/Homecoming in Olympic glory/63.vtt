00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:04.066
It can't be just the loser next door.

2
00:00:04.066 --> 00:00:05.700
Even if the ancestral grave catches fire

3
00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.866
You can't be a world record breaker.

4
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.800
The facts are all in front of you and you don't believe it

5
00:00:10.866 --> 00:00:12.133
It seems that I can't call

6
00:00:12.133 --> 00:00:14.000
Wake up, you sleeper!

7
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.933
I can't let my sister know about Lin Wenwen now.

8
00:00:15.933 --> 00:00:17.300
So capable

9
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:20.000
What if they make up?

10
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.366
Then won't he press me for the rest of his life?

11
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.966
This necklace was indeed given to you by Mr. Yang himself

12
00:00:25.966 --> 00:00:26.866
Steady

13
00:00:29.166 --> 00:00:33.066
But he didn't give it as a reward to the champion.

14
00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.333
But as a reward for funding poor students

15
00:00:36.333 --> 00:00:37.200
Send it out

16
00:00:40.133 --> 00:00:42.533
Ha I mean

17
00:00:42.533 --> 00:00:45.566
Lin Wenwen, it turns out that you are a poor student.

18
00:00:45.566 --> 00:00:48.366
You have the nerve to come and compete with us for the championship

19
00:00:48.366 --> 00:00:50.200
You don't even know shame.

20
00:00:50.566 --> 00:00:51.700
Curse it. Curse it.

21
00:00:51.766 --> 00:00:53.400
The more you scold, the better.

22
00:00:53.533 --> 00:00:56.366
It is best that Liang Wenwen no longer recognizes him as a mother

23
00:00:56.566 --> 00:00:57.966
Why did you lie?

24
00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.366
You clearly heard that Mr. Yang gave me a championship necklace

25
00:01:00.366 --> 00:01:00.966
intention

26
00:01:00.966 --> 00:01:04.500
Why was the truth exposed?

27
00:01:04.666 --> 00:01:06.033
Angry

28
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.366
Just said something in front of us

29
00:01:08.366 --> 00:01:09.766
It's all fake

30
00:01:09.766 --> 00:01:11.133
Well, you root

31
00:01:11.133 --> 00:01:13.600
It's a life of poverty that is not visible

32
00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.066
Because the poor are poor

33
00:01:15.133 --> 00:01:18.466
Mr. Yang has just sent a kindness to let you participate in this poetry conference

34
00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:20.800
Really poor people have short ambitions

35
00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:24.333
Children from poor families can't turn over for the rest of their lives

36
00:01:24.333 --> 00:01:25.433
You go too far.

37
00:01:25.933 --> 00:01:27.666
Your eyes are above the top

38
00:01:27.666 --> 00:01:29.066
Dogs look down on people

39
00:01:29.133 --> 00:01:32.400
Why do you rich people get ahead?

40
00:01:32.533 --> 00:01:35.833
And we poor people don't deserve good grades

41
00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.066
Dad, calm down first

42
00:01:38.533 --> 00:01:41.800
I will definitely ask for an explanation for us on this matter.

43
00:01:41.866 --> 00:01:43.366
Get justice for us

44
00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:44.900
Oh, dear.

45
00:01:44.933 --> 00:01:47.966
What kind of storm can a pair of poor wastes set off?

46
00:01:47.966 --> 00:01:49.366
It's ridiculous

47
00:01:49.766 --> 00:01:53.000
Did I break the world record?

48
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.800
I won't prove it to you first

49
00:01:55.666 --> 00:01:59.066
But now I've proven myself not to steal

50
00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:04.666
You people slander me in front of everyone

51
00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.533
Should you give it to me now?

52
00:02:06.533 --> 00:02:07.600
Apologize

53
00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.433
Why should we apologize to a rice bucket?

54
00:02:10.533 --> 00:02:11.400
Lin Wenwen

55
00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.800
Do you know who you are?

56
00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.966
Ah, you are a poor student.

57
00:02:15.966 --> 00:02:18.900
Why do you let the champion family apologize to you?
