00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:01.066
Democratic Jianguo

2
00:00:01.133 --> 00:00:03.366
You can show it to grandma today.

3
00:00:03.366 --> 00:00:04.566
Our family Yaozu

4
00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:07.200
How did you get on the Olympic shortlist?

5
00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.266
Hello let you know

6
00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:12.066
You raised this trash who only knows how to cook

7
00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:14.566
That's a shameless loser

8
00:00:15.366 --> 00:00:18.600
In addition to wasting money, it is only a waste of air

9
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.366
It's useless.

10
00:00:20.366 --> 00:00:21.666
It's not like our medicine team

11
00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.800
That can be Guangyaomen coal

12
00:00:23.933 --> 00:00:26.266
Changing the future of our old neighborhood

13
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.366
That's right, my son needs to pack 200kg with ease

14
00:00:31.666 --> 00:00:35.233
Do you know what 200 kilograms is?

15
00:00:35.566 --> 00:00:38.200
The weight of 4 bags of cement

16
00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.366
In front of our medicinal wine

17
00:00:40.366 --> 00:00:44.666
It's like grasping cotton with your bare hands.

18
00:00:44.666 --> 00:00:47.866
200 kilograms of medicinal wine is too good

19
00:00:47.933 --> 00:00:49.133
Disabled since the founding of the country

20
00:00:49.133 --> 00:00:50.200
Our Chenjiacun

21
00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.800
Never again has there been such a sports genius

22
00:00:53.066 --> 00:00:55.266
The Lord is really young and promising

23
00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.933
Lord, you really deserve your name.

24
00:00:57.933 --> 00:01:00.200
So young to have this kind of ability

25
00:01:00.266 --> 00:01:02.133
Oops, there is so much power

26
00:01:02.133 --> 00:01:04.100
You're a child prodigy reincarnated

27
00:01:04.266 --> 00:01:06.666
Come and revitalize our Linjia Village

28
00:01:06.666 --> 00:01:08.500
Yes, yes, yes, understand?

29
00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:10.100
Did you hear that?

30
00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.566
This is the gap between me and you.

31
00:01:12.766 --> 00:01:14.400
I told you so.

32
00:01:14.566 --> 00:01:17.366
I am the Nine Heavens True Dragon

33
00:01:17.366 --> 00:01:19.433
Just a stink in a cesspool

34
00:01:19.566 --> 00:01:20.700
What are you comparing to me?

35
00:01:21.733 --> 00:01:23.266
Dad, trust me

36
00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:24.600
I am better than Lin Yaozu

37
00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.933
I'm bragging, who wouldn't?

38
00:01:26.933 --> 00:01:28.100
You don't really think

39
00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.333
If you eat more, you can become a Hercules, right?

40
00:01:30.333 --> 00:01:31.733
According to you

41
00:01:31.733 --> 00:01:32.466
Those meals

42
00:01:32.466 --> 00:01:34.833
Can every barrel win the world championship?

43
00:01:35.333 --> 00:01:37.100
Hahaha

44
00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:39.266
Hahaha

45
00:01:39.266 --> 00:01:42.066
Oops, son, what are you arguing with a trash?

46
00:01:42.066 --> 00:01:43.733
Your identity in vain

47
00:01:43.733 --> 00:01:45.566
You'd better show it to everyone quickly

48
00:01:45.566 --> 00:01:47.500
Your heroic appearance on the field

49
00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.466
Germany takes out the phone

50
00:01:50.466 --> 00:01:51.966
It's time to take a photo

51
00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.500
Is it time to record?

52
00:01:55.366 --> 00:01:56.700
Take a good look

53
00:01:56.766 --> 00:01:58.000
Study hard for me.
