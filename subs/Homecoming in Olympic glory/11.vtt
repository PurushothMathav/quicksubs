00:00:01.066 --> 00:00:04.166
The folk medicine group snatched 140 kilograms

2
00:00:04.166 --> 00:00:06.600
Stop lifting 160 kg

3
00:00:06.666 --> 00:00:08.900
Total weight 300kg

4
00:00:16.666 --> 00:00:18.666
Ahhh

5
00:00:21.466 --> 00:00:22.633
Let's all take a look.

6
00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:24.800
Son lifts 300kg

7
00:00:27.566 --> 00:00:30.433
This result will make it into the Olympic shortlist

8
00:00:30.666 --> 00:00:32.666
Is the standard a bit low this year?

9
00:00:32.666 --> 00:00:34.866
But this neighboring village except me

10
00:00:34.866 --> 00:00:36.733
No one is better than me

11
00:00:36.733 --> 00:00:39.266
Oops, no doubt about it.

12
00:00:39.333 --> 00:00:40.166
to count

13
00:00:40.366 --> 00:00:43.866
It's the person from our village who made the Olympic shortlist

14
00:00:43.866 --> 00:00:45.266
Hahaha hey

15
00:00:45.266 --> 00:00:48.300
Boss Yang of Genting Group who gave you a bonus

16
00:00:48.566 --> 00:00:50.100
It will come in a while.

17
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.533
Sister, your Yaozu is so promising

18
00:00:52.533 --> 00:00:53.766
So patient

19
00:00:53.766 --> 00:00:56.166
My envious eyes are green

20
00:00:56.166 --> 00:00:58.366
1 million oops

21
00:00:58.366 --> 00:00:59.700
Don't you see who this is?

22
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:02.000
What 1 million son

23
00:01:02.066 --> 00:01:05.100
If our family Yaozu wins the Olympic championship

24
00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:05.966
Glory for the country

25
00:01:05.966 --> 00:01:07.700
Is that 1 million measurable

26
00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.366
Good from today

27
00:01:10.366 --> 00:01:13.866
The Lin family's family tree is about to open a single page for Yao Zu

28
00:01:14.066 --> 00:01:17.033
Hello, let the children and grandchildren of the Lin family remember it firmly

29
00:01:17.466 --> 00:01:19.066
Lin Yaozu's three words

30
00:01:21.933 --> 00:01:24.233
Ah, matching the family tree

31
00:01:24.466 --> 00:01:26.366
Aunt

32
00:01:26.466 --> 00:01:28.266
Are you so sure?

33
00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.700
Was the family tree created for you?

34
00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.433
Ouch, Lin Wenwen

35
00:01:32.666 --> 00:01:34.700
Are you completely crazy?

36
00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.533
That family tree wasn't written for my family, Yao Zu

37
00:01:37.533 --> 00:01:40.700
Is it still open for you, hahahaha?

38
00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:46.033
That's right, the Lin family should open a page for me today

39
00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.466
Ouch hahahaha
