1
00:00:00.666 --> 00:00:02.000
Born to be Human

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.466
Why are there high and low?

3
00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:06.166
Just because he is the champion

4
00:00:06.333 --> 00:00:07.533
Do something wrong

5
00:00:07.533 --> 00:00:09.966
Shouldn't I apologize to this poor student?

6
00:00:09.966 --> 00:00:10.966
Exactly.

7
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.300
There are highs and lows in life

8
00:00:14.533 --> 00:00:17.566
Who made your father a useless wimp?

9
00:00:17.566 --> 00:00:19.766
So you deserve to be bullied

10
00:00:19.933 --> 00:00:22.266
Rich or poor are people

11
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.366
This is not the reason for you not to apologize

12
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.400
I'll double-label it, so I won't apologize.

13
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:28.300
What's wrong with me?

14
00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.333
My husband is the manager of Yunting Hotel

15
00:00:31.333 --> 00:00:32.666
Prosperity

16
00:00:32.666 --> 00:00:36.466
And your father is a waste of money and ability

17
00:00:36.466 --> 00:00:39.000
My son is the champion

18
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.100
Dragon and phoenix among the future

19
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.233
And you need a poor society funded by others

20
00:00:44.266 --> 00:00:46.600
Why should we apologize to you?

21
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.400
OK, then I'll prove it myself

22
00:00:50.133 --> 00:00:51.700
Born to be Human

23
00:00:51.733 --> 00:00:53.266
All beings are equal

24
00:00:53.533 --> 00:00:55.666
Since you don't give me justice

25
00:00:55.666 --> 00:00:58.700
Then I'll get justice myself

26
00:00:58.966 --> 00:01:00.033
A rice bucket

27
00:01:00.466 --> 00:01:02.233
Don't be crazy.

28
00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.800
You and your father are both trash and rice buckets

29
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.433
What do you get justice for?

30
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.033
Daughter, I support you.

31
00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:10.900
We are not poor

32
00:01:11.066 --> 00:01:13.133
We can't look down on people with these dog eyes

33
00:01:13.133 --> 00:01:14.700
The snob bowed his head

34
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.166
Mr. Yang is here

35
00:01:16.166 --> 00:01:19.566
I can't believe that there is no place for reason in this world

36
00:01:19.566 --> 00:01:21.366
Your head is squeezed by the door

37
00:01:21.466 --> 00:01:22.500
I'll tell you what.

38
00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.100
Your daughter is simply a lowly poor student

39
00:01:25.166 --> 00:01:25.966
You really

40
00:01:25.966 --> 00:01:28.966
Want a big shot like Mr. Yang to help you?

41
00:01:28.966 --> 00:01:29.766
how

42
00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.133
I thought someone said a few kind words to you

43
00:01:32.133 --> 00:01:33.600
I really respect you

44
00:01:34.533 --> 00:01:37.400
Sure enough, people are poor for a reason

45
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.400
Be obedient

46
00:01:39.566 --> 00:01:42.833
Yang always pitied you before giving you the gold necklace

47
00:01:42.933 --> 00:01:44.066
You don't really think

48
00:01:44.066 --> 00:01:45.266
Have you made it?

49
00:01:45.266 --> 00:01:47.400
Hahahahaha

50
00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.133
Waste is waste

51
00:01:49.133 --> 00:01:51.333
If Mr. Yang really likes you

52
00:01:51.333 --> 00:01:52.866
How could it be possible to use a gold necklace?

53
00:01:52.866 --> 00:01:54.066
I sent you away

54
00:01:54.066 --> 00:01:55.833
Mr. Yang congratulatory gift knife
