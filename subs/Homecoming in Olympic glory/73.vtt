00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.733
Mr. Yang, why are you hitting me?

2
00:00:03.733 --> 00:00:05.400
And I'm right about that.

3
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.566
They are a pair of poor farmers.

4
00:00:08.566 --> 00:00:11.800
Why do you want to keep them here?

5
00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:15.566
Who the hell allowed you to talk to me like that?

6
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.100
You don't think you're superior

7
00:00:18.666 --> 00:00:22.400
You don't think Mr. Lin and classmate Lin

8
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.633
Can't compare to me

9
00:00:25.566 --> 00:00:26.866
In my opinion

10
00:00:27.366 --> 00:00:31.433
You are no match for one finger of Mr. Lin

11
00:00:33.066 --> 00:00:35.566
Mr. Li, although he is unchanged

12
00:00:35.933 --> 00:00:37.500
But over the years

13
00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.033
Still relying on his hard-working hands

14
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.166
I worked hard to pull up classmate Lin

15
00:00:44.766 --> 00:00:46.033
In my opinion

16
00:00:46.933 --> 00:00:48.233
Such a spirit

17
00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:49.700
This kind of talk

18
00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:51.800
It's something you can't compare to

19
00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:53.166
Prime Minister

20
00:00:53.566 --> 00:00:57.233
Why do you insult someone who strives to live

21
00:00:57.366 --> 00:00:58.466
Now.

22
00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:03.600
Immediately apologize to Mr. Lin and classmate Lin

23
00:01:06.366 --> 00:01:09.266
Mr. Yang, I heard it right, right?

24
00:01:09.333 --> 00:01:12.833
You want me to apologize to this poor couple?

25
00:01:13.666 --> 00:01:18.233
Mr. Yang, hahahahaha

26
00:01:18.266 --> 00:01:19.800
Chen Xiaolu, hey, hey.

27
00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.066
If you do something wrong, you will claim it.

28
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.166
Don't you understand this?

29
00:01:25.333 --> 00:01:26.500
I'll tell you what.

30
00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.733
If you let me see it again

31
00:01:28.733 --> 00:01:32.700
I heard you were half disrespectful to your neighbor

32
00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.600
Don't blame me. You're welcome.

33
00:01:37.766 --> 00:01:40.366
Mr. Yang, I'm afraid you have misunderstood.

34
00:01:40.366 --> 00:01:43.666
These women are here to eat and drink today

35
00:01:43.666 --> 00:01:46.066
And they want money.
