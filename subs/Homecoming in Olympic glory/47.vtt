1
00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:00.700
I didn't expect it.

2
00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:02.733
In order to participate in this Olympic Poetry Conference

3
00:00:02.733 --> 00:00:05.233
You even got a fake invitation

4
00:00:05.466 --> 00:00:06.333
True or False

5
00:00:06.333 --> 00:00:08.700
It's not something you can decide just by opening your mouth

6
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:09.733
If you don't believe me

7
00:00:09.733 --> 00:00:11.666
You can call Mr. Yang and ask

8
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.966
You can also call Mr. Yang

9
00:00:14.133 --> 00:00:15.000
Give it

10
00:00:15.766 --> 00:00:17.500
Bitch is hypocritical

11
00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:18.000
Really?

12
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.466
The invitations are all made of fine gold dye

13
00:00:21.666 --> 00:00:23.000
You touch this

14
00:00:23.066 --> 00:00:27.100
The gold dust has fallen off, dare you tell me it's true?

15
00:00:28.266 --> 00:00:30.066
False invitation letter

16
00:00:30.733 --> 00:00:32.433
Simply unforgivable

17
00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.766
Liu Huilan, what are you doing?

18
00:00:34.866 --> 00:00:36.366
This is a steady invitation

19
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.033
Why do you want it?

20
00:00:42.166 --> 00:00:43.600
Come on

21
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:45.100
This goblin

22
00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:48.000
Or was it really handed over to me by Mr. Yao himself?

23
00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:49.866
I don't have time to talk nonsense with you

24
00:00:49.866 --> 00:00:51.700
Throw these bitches out

25
00:00:51.966 --> 00:00:53.800
If you insist on not leaving, you will be dizzy directly.

26
00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:56.200
Especially that little bitch

27
00:00:56.466 --> 00:00:58.433
If you don't obey me, just break his leg for me

28
00:00:58.966 --> 00:01:01.233
Willing to affect the image of our hotel

29
00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.666
Liu Huilan, do you still eat people?

30
00:01:03.733 --> 00:01:05.300
Wenwen is your niece

31
00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.500
You're going to break his leg?

32
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:08.866
I don't have a niece like that

33
00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.966
Hit me to death

34
00:01:12.166 --> 00:01:13.600
Stop it

35
00:01:14.266 --> 00:01:15.900
Ah, Mr. Yang

36
00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.300
Why did you come in person?

37
00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.600
Is this group of turtles obstructing your eyes?

38
00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.033
Hey, don't worry, I'll be courting death right away.
