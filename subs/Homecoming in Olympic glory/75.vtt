00:00:00.566 --> 00:00:01.633
Ah, Mr. Yang

2
00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:03.100
You don't know

3
00:00:03.333 --> 00:00:06.000
This dead girl has been lazy since she was a child

4
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.333
Don't study hard when you grow up

5
00:00:07.333 --> 00:00:10.266
He also seduced his coach for this competition

6
00:00:10.933 --> 00:00:12.600
Do such a vulgar thing

7
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.566
I wouldn't dare to have such a daughter

8
00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.866
Mr. Yang has a moral problem

9
00:00:19.166 --> 00:00:21.366
How could he be our VIP?

10
00:00:21.366 --> 00:00:24.166
Besides, don't let them get away with it

11
00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.466
Otherwise they can do anything

12
00:00:26.533 --> 00:00:28.133
What he does best is deceive people

13
00:00:28.133 --> 00:00:30.300
You must not be fooled by him

14
00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.866
Bitch, you haven't been honest

15
00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:34.366
How did you trick Mr. Yang?

16
00:00:34.366 --> 00:00:38.300
Tell me now if you don't believe me or not

17
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.433
Otherwise, what do you want?

18
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.900
Mr. Yang, of course I want this rice bucket to look good

19
00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:45.966
Mr. Yang, don't worry.

20
00:00:45.966 --> 00:00:48.166
I must have a way to make this bitch

21
00:00:48.166 --> 00:00:49.833
Hand over your crimes

22
00:00:50.133 --> 00:00:52.200
You rice bucket, hurry up and say it

23
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.600
How did you deceive Mr. Yang?

24
00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:54.933
If you don't say it again

25
00:00:54.933 --> 00:00:58.033
I'll strip off your clothes and pull out the oil for dieting

26
00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.433
You have to include my clothes.

27
00:01:00.666 --> 00:01:02.000
Then Stamp World

28
00:01:02.466 --> 00:01:04.666
That's right to make you not listen to me

29
00:01:04.666 --> 00:01:07.000
Hurry up and be honest, how did you coax Mr. Yang?

30
00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:08.200
You go too far.
