00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.900
Sorry dad

2
00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.700
You are what your body suffers from.

3
00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:06.066
You are not bad

4
00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:08.733
If you train well, you can participate in weightlifting

5
00:00:08.733 --> 00:00:11.100
It's okay, I have the strength.

6
00:00:11.166 --> 00:00:12.900
I will farm from now on

7
00:00:12.966 --> 00:00:14.466
Can also feed us

8
00:00:18.133 --> 00:00:20.066
That's what happened to your dad

9
00:00:20.066 --> 00:00:22.833
I won't allow you to waste your talent

10
00:00:27.533 --> 00:00:30.600
My dad haha, what are you doing with this water at the bottom of the sea?

11
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.333
Let Dad go to the construction site to sell coolies

12
00:00:33.333 --> 00:00:35.166
I must give you up

13
00:00:36.466 --> 00:00:39.033
If I'm going to sell coolies, I'll go

14
00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.166
You're going to play sports?

15
00:00:41.166 --> 00:00:44.033
How can you wear out your body?

16
00:00:44.066 --> 00:00:46.200
You've wasted a lot of time now

17
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.600
If you don't hurry up

18
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.666
There is no hope in this life

19
00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:51.033
Dear villagers

20
00:00:52.133 --> 00:00:54.766
The quadrennial Olympic trials

21
00:00:54.766 --> 00:00:57.233
It will start in a week.

22
00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.500
The big boss in the provincial capital speaks

23
00:00:59.766 --> 00:01:02.966
If you go out, you can enter the Olympics

24
00:01:02.966 --> 00:01:04.866
shortlist of contestants

25
00:01:04.866 --> 00:01:07.866
Bonus 1 million

26
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.900
Daughter, dad is dying anyway

27
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.433
If you can win 1 million

28
00:01:14.466 --> 00:01:17.366
You can have a peaceful and smooth life for the rest of your life

29
00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.300
It's not a pity for Dad to die

30
00:01:20.966 --> 00:01:22.300
Jianguo Wenwen

31
00:01:22.533 --> 00:01:24.000
Jianguo hahaha

32
00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.066
We all heard about the Olympic trials

33
00:01:27.166 --> 00:01:29.666
We all hope you can make it to the tryouts

34
00:01:29.666 --> 00:01:31.166
Have a good grade

35
00:01:31.533 --> 00:01:33.366
Take this money

36
00:01:33.366 --> 00:01:34.400
Buy some nutrition

37
00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.300
This is not to be pulled down

38
00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:37.700
You are the pride of your father

39
00:01:37.766 --> 00:01:38.800
Don't let him down.

40
00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:39.900
This is not true.

41
00:01:40.133 --> 00:01:42.666
Jianguo, please accept this money.

42
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.500
You are not much richer than me

43
00:01:45.533 --> 00:01:47.500
How can we take your money?

44
00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.400
As a result, 20 years ago, our village was very poor

45
00:01:52.166 --> 00:01:54.966
It's not because you've seen it. It's a provincial team member

46
00:01:55.366 --> 00:01:56.800
After the wounded soldier retires

47
00:01:56.933 --> 00:01:59.666
Coach the children for free in the village

48
00:02:00.366 --> 00:02:02.766
This is the famous technological strength

49
00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.366
Don't push this money to death

50
00:02:05.766 --> 00:02:07.966
Your conditions are similar to mine

51
00:02:07.966 --> 00:02:11.000
Where did you get so much money?

52
00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.833
What's wrong with you?

53
00:02:17.966 --> 00:02:20.500
You went to the construction site to sell coolies

54
00:02:21.266 --> 00:02:23.900
What are you doing on the construction site?

55
00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.633
You also want to take the college entrance examination

56
00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.066
Are you taking another hand?

57
00:02:28.066 --> 00:02:28.900
Wen Wenjie

58
00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.633
Sure to do well in the sports world

59
00:02:31.766 --> 00:02:34.033
This little injury is worth it

60
00:02:34.866 --> 00:02:35.666
Blind date

61
00:02:36.866 --> 00:02:38.566
Your kindness

62
00:02:39.966 --> 00:02:41.900
Hey, lend me, lend me, I can't do it

63
00:02:41.966 --> 00:02:44.066
I will definitely repay you.

64
00:02:44.133 --> 00:02:45.766
What are you doing?

65
00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:49.300
Your kindness to our village is the greatest

66
00:02:50.466 --> 00:02:51.400
kneel down

67
00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:53.900
Hey Wenwen

68
00:02:54.533 --> 00:02:56.066
You will be successful in the future

69
00:02:56.066 --> 00:02:58.233
Be sure to repay your relatives well

70
00:02:58.666 --> 00:03:01.566
The money you go to train is everyone

71
00:03:01.866 --> 00:03:04.466
Coolie played it for you

72
00:03:04.466 --> 00:03:07.600
The money in your hand is their hard-earned money.

73
00:03:07.733 --> 00:03:09.100
Thank you, Second Division

74
00:03:09.533 --> 00:03:10.333
biting

75
00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.166
Also flow out

76
00:03:42.133 --> 00:03:43.066
Sister Wenwen

77
00:03:45.866 --> 00:03:47.166
Waiting for your good news.

78
00:03:51.966 --> 00:03:53.566
I will definitely try my best.

79
00:03:53.733 --> 00:03:55.766
I will definitely honor my ancestors
