00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:01.233
I bah

2
00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:05.200
Just Lin Wenwen's stupid and stupid pet

3
00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:09.266
What other Olympic shortlist did he make?

4
00:00:09.466 --> 00:00:13.300
Are you making an international joke?

5
00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:14.300
I see.

6
00:00:14.566 --> 00:00:17.400
Do you think our family is rich now?

7
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:18.966
Want to cling to us

8
00:00:18.966 --> 00:00:21.866
Ouch, even so

9
00:00:21.866 --> 00:00:25.033
Can you find a more reliable reason?

10
00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.933
What's more, Lin Wenwen's money-losing product

11
00:00:28.933 --> 00:00:30.333
Even our family

12
00:00:30.333 --> 00:00:33.933
Aotian's finger can't compare to it

13
00:00:33.933 --> 00:00:37.333
Even if he was really shortlisted?

14
00:00:37.333 --> 00:00:39.600
The Olympic shortlist

15
00:00:40.566 --> 00:00:42.833
We don't look up to him.

16
00:00:42.933 --> 00:00:45.666
It's just mom, I'm not lying

17
00:00:45.666 --> 00:00:48.700
Smell him really oh okay okay I know

18
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:49.000
Hey

19
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.466
You just watched Aotian become the champion

20
00:00:52.466 --> 00:00:54.333
You are not balanced

21
00:00:54.333 --> 00:00:57.766
Ouch, I just want to brag and find some balance

22
00:00:58.066 --> 00:01:00.500
Even if you want to brag

23
00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.900
Can you pick a more reliable reason to blow it?

24
00:01:05.066 --> 00:01:08.000
A guy like you can only brag

25
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.766
You can't do anything at all?

26
00:01:12.066 --> 00:01:14.366
Fortunately, my daughter divorced you in the first place

27
00:01:14.366 --> 00:01:18.100
Otherwise, where would our Liu family get such incredible wealth?

28
00:01:18.533 --> 00:01:21.066
Mom, I kindly invite you

29
00:01:21.066 --> 00:01:23.300
How can you say that about me and Wenwen?

30
00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:25.966
I said so what happened to him?

31
00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.866
He eats by himself like a pig

32
00:01:30.066 --> 00:01:31.766
No one can say anything about him

33
00:01:32.366 --> 00:01:36.700
Stupid and stupid like him

34
00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:40.300
Whether there will be a man in the future is a question

35
00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.566
Oops want me to say

36
00:01:43.366 --> 00:01:45.966
He's not too young.

37
00:01:45.966 --> 00:01:48.466
What else do you go to?

38
00:01:49.066 --> 00:01:51.233
You let him come down quickly

39
00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:55.533
I quickly found someone to marry while I was young

40
00:01:55.533 --> 00:01:58.366
Well, you can also receive some bride price money.

41
00:01:58.366 --> 00:02:01.700
Don't forget to raise him for so many years
