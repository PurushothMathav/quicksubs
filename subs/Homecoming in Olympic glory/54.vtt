00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.400
That's right, shit

2
00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:04.533
Give you a liver and you'll climb up

3
00:00:04.533 --> 00:00:05.833
Hey hey bitch

4
00:00:05.866 --> 00:00:08.100
It's useless for you to impersonate anyone today

5
00:00:08.333 --> 00:00:10.000
Li Yaozu is your Tan Ge, right?

6
00:00:10.133 --> 00:00:14.100
His parents just sent Moments an hour ago

7
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.700
Said that Lin Yaozu was the first in your county's trials

8
00:00:17.766 --> 00:00:20.366
You can't get anywhere in your county

9
00:00:20.766 --> 00:00:23.266
Why did you get here to catch it?

10
00:00:23.366 --> 00:00:26.133
Lin Wenwen, Lin Jianguo, oops.

11
00:00:26.133 --> 00:00:30.100
You two trash are so shameless

12
00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:33.300
How dare you pretend to be garlic at this world event

13
00:00:33.466 --> 00:00:36.666
Are you crazy to be famous?

14
00:00:37.666 --> 00:00:38.600
Fortunately

15
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.033
That Lin Yaozu is a friend of my grandson Aotian

16
00:00:42.166 --> 00:00:45.466
Otherwise, I was almost deceived by them.

17
00:00:45.533 --> 00:00:49.233
Since you don't understand human language

18
00:00:49.466 --> 00:00:52.166
Then why don't you ask Li Yaozu?

19
00:00:52.866 --> 00:00:55.833
Am I lying?

20
00:00:56.066 --> 00:00:58.500
Do you want us to embarrass ourselves?

21
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.566
What have you been like since you were a child?

22
00:01:00.566 --> 00:01:02.233
You think I don't know?

23
00:01:02.333 --> 00:01:03.900
Mentally retarded since childhood

24
00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:05.500
Can eat like a pig

25
00:01:05.766 --> 00:01:07.066
You were trash as a kid

26
00:01:07.066 --> 00:01:08.900
No matter how long you grow, you are garbage

27
00:01:09.066 --> 00:01:10.166
Try harder

28
00:01:10.166 --> 00:01:13.033
You can't escape the fate of being a waste

29
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.166
What use are you

30
00:01:14.166 --> 00:01:15.966
You might as well die

31
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.366
I'm useless I'm trash

32
00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:20.566
I am trash

33
00:01:20.566 --> 00:01:23.466
But no matter how useless I am, I am also your biological daughter

34
00:01:23.533 --> 00:01:25.366
I have your blood on me

35
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.166
I can't figure it out.

36
00:01:28.466 --> 00:01:30.833
Why do you treat me like an enemy?

37
00:01:30.866 --> 00:01:32.500
You are not my daughter

38
00:01:32.733 --> 00:01:35.800
I regret why I gave birth to you

39
00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:38.800
Why didn't I strangle you when I gave birth to you?

40
00:01:38.966 --> 00:01:41.900
So you don't have to do something that shames me now

41
00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:44.033
Those who lose me see my eyes

42
00:01:44.533 --> 00:01:46.466
When did I embarrass you?

43
00:01:46.466 --> 00:01:48.333
Don't think I don't know

44
00:01:48.333 --> 00:01:50.333
You are intellectually cheap to compete

45
00:01:50.333 --> 00:01:52.766
And those coaches don't know

46
00:01:52.766 --> 00:01:54.400
Which one will not lose me?

47
00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:55.766
Which one doesn't envy my eyes?

48
00:01:56.333 --> 00:01:58.866
These are all rumors spread by others

49
00:01:59.133 --> 00:02:02.633
Even if you believed me once since you were a child

50
00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:04.733
I am your biological daughter

51
00:02:04.733 --> 00:02:06.400
Why are you doing this to me?
