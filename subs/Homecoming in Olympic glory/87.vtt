00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:01.266
How dare you hit me

2
00:00:01.266 --> 00:00:03.100
Days don't just hit you

3
00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:05.033
I want to divorce you

4
00:00:05.533 --> 00:00:06.633
Just leave

5
00:00:07.266 --> 00:00:08.966
I don't serve you two

6
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.400
As a result, that year

7
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:13.733
It was my fault.

00:00:13.733 --> 00:00:15.266
I know now that I was wrong

9
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:16.866
We live well

10
00:00:16.933 --> 00:00:19.566
Can I take care of you women?

11
00:00:19.566 --> 00:00:21.200
What are you like now?

12
00:00:22.133 --> 00:00:24.366
It made me feel unfamiliar.

13
00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:27.400
I'm having a good time with my dad

14
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:28.833
I don't need you at all.

15
00:00:31.133 --> 00:00:33.766
Mr. Yang's ceremony is about to start

16
00:00:33.766 --> 00:00:36.266
Please clean up the irrelevant personnel.

17
00:00:36.266 --> 00:00:38.233
Hello, people!

18
00:00:38.366 --> 00:00:40.666
Throw this family out for me

19
00:00:40.666 --> 00:00:42.800
What are you doing?

20
00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.266
Why are you letting me go?

23
00:00:46.766 --> 00:00:48.133
You asked for it.

24
00:00:48.133 --> 00:00:49.266
No one else's to blame

25
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.766

00:00:55.133 --> 00:00:57.200
You are welcome

27
00:00:57.266 --> 00:00:58.466
This is what I should do.

28
00:00:59.266 --> 00:01:00.333
The leaders are almost there.

29
00:01:00.333 --> 00:01:02.233
