00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:01.833
Even if you are the village chief

2
00:00:02.133 --> 00:00:03.966
You can't humiliate my daughter either.

3
00:00:03.966 --> 00:00:06.500
Hey, are we humiliating you?

4
00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:09.200
It's because you don't know yourself, okay?

5
00:00:09.566 --> 00:00:12.100
How long has it been since I changed my clothes?

6
00:00:12.266 --> 00:00:15.666
I could smell it three miles away.

7
00:00:16.133 --> 00:00:17.700
Is it smoked to death?

8
00:00:17.733 --> 00:00:20.733
Besides, the village chief is in the ancestral hall

9
00:00:20.733 --> 00:00:23.033
It was to celebrate my son's death

10
00:00:23.133 --> 00:00:25.700
Did well at the Olympic trials

11
00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:27.200
You make a party

12
00:00:27.566 --> 00:00:28.400
aunt

13
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.066
I broke the world record at the Olympic trials

14
00:00:31.066 --> 00:00:32.466
Why don't you let me enter the ancestral hall?

15
00:00:33.733 --> 00:00:36.200
Lin Wenwen, I still thought you were

16
00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.900
They just eat more than pigs.

17
00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:40.066
Now, I think I need to add another one.

18
00:00:40.133 --> 00:00:42.700
Your skin is thicker than the city wall

19
00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.100
That's an Olympic record.

20
00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.500
I wasn't a Piston when I rolled the tournament

21
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:50.833
Take a look.

22
00:00:54.066 --> 00:00:55.966
Mom and Dad, look

23
00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:59.500
Yo Yo Hahaha Hey report Lin Jianguo

24
00:00:59.966 --> 00:01:01.900
You're a loser yourself

25
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.100
And raised a liar full of lies

26
00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:05.800
Oh, your face!

27
00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.733
I was just a little hypoglycemic and couldn't work it out

28
00:01:08.733 --> 00:01:11.466
And then Coach Tang gave me some glucose.

29
00:01:11.466 --> 00:01:12.800
Later, after I recovered

30
00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.600
I broke the world record

31
00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.000
You were all gone

32
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.100
You didn't see it.

33
00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.566
Bing Wenwen, are you lying here?

34
00:01:20.566 --> 00:01:22.700
You can break a world record if you want to

35
00:01:22.733 --> 00:01:24.466
Especially when we're not around

36
00:01:24.466 --> 00:01:25.733
You can't even get in

37
00:01:25.733 --> 00:01:26.766
As soon as we leave

38
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.833
You broke the record

39
00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:30.766
Yeah, that's it.

40
00:01:30.766 --> 00:01:32.300
Coach Tang can testify to me

41
00:01:32.366 --> 00:01:35.200
Isn't there a machine that can check results?

42
00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.400
Go in and check it out, and you can see it at a glance.

43
00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.833
Yes Yes Yes Yes Coach Tang Coach Tang

44
00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:42.300
It's so affectionate

45
00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:43.700
Hey

46
00:01:44.466 --> 00:01:47.266
You're not having an affair with that old man, are you?

47
00:01:47.266 --> 00:01:48.066
Ah!

48
00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.966
You weren't even qualified to serve

49
00:01:50.966 --> 00:01:53.533
What is that guy surnamed Tang doing?

50
00:01:53.533 --> 00:01:55.433
Risking my reputation to protect you

51
00:01:55.566 --> 00:01:58.400
I was wondering if you were crazy

52
00:01:58.766 --> 00:02:00.633
Now I understand

53
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.200
He's not crazy.

54
00:02:02.466 --> 00:02:03.633
He has an appetite.

55
00:02:03.933 --> 00:02:05.966
He can even eat a guy like you

56
00:02:05.966 --> 00:02:08.366
You just climbed into that old man's bed

57
00:02:08.366 --> 00:02:10.600
Hahaha
