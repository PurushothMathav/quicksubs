00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:01.533
My parents are sick

2
00:00:01.533 --> 00:00:03.466
I need money for my tuition.

3
00:00:03.466 --> 00:00:05.033
Just borrow 5,000

4
00:00:05.166 --> 00:00:08.400
I will definitely pay you back when the summer vacation is completed.

5
00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:11.200
It's alright, we're done repairing the tape.

6
00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:12.233
No need to make a single item.

7
00:00:12.333 --> 00:00:13.600
No need to check credit

8
00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:15.400
Just special?

9
00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.666
For poor college students like you

10
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.400
Wu Qi, it's a college student like you

11
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.366
Really? That?

12
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.466
When can the loan be made?

13
00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.666
What about interest?

14
00:00:28.666 --> 00:00:29.833
Oh, dear.

15
00:00:30.933 --> 00:00:33.033
Can you do it now?

16
00:00:33.066 --> 00:00:35.066
8 cents per day

17
00:00:35.566 --> 00:00:37.666
If there's no problem, just sign it

18
00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:38.866
Okay, borrow it, pay it back.

19
00:00:38.966 --> 00:00:40.566
Is it not difficult to borrow again?

20
00:00:41.533 --> 00:00:43.800
8 cents a day

21
00:00:44.966 --> 00:00:46.400
Can you ask for interest?

22
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.866
You are such a kind person, oops.

23
00:00:49.866 --> 00:00:54.000
We all do campus loans for charity, mom.

24
00:00:54.966 --> 00:00:55.800
Sign it.

25
00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:57.633
OK

26
00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:10.400
Mr. Xu

27
00:01:11.866 --> 00:01:14.466
Yaoyao, our campus loan?

28
00:01:14.466 --> 00:01:18.200
I don't know if you know the rule.

29
00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:20.666
What rule?

30
00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.966
Look, our campus loan does not do mortgage.

31
00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:26.366
No guarantee

32
00:01:26.366 --> 00:01:29.266
But we're going to take some pictures

33
00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:31.800
When you don't pay back the money

34
00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.500
Hello, do you have a certificate?

35
00:01:34.166 --> 00:01:37.233
Ah ok I'll shoot

36
00:01:38.533 --> 00:01:41.266
Hahaha, it's not like that.

37
00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:46.100
belt

38
00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.066
Stripped cards
