2
00:00:01.933 --> 00:00:03.400
Nonsense, you believe him too

3
00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:05.466
Take me away

4
00:00:05.466 --> 00:00:07.200
How much will I give?

5
00:00:19.066 --> 00:00:22.266
Remember, I beg you not to die again

6
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:23.400

7
00:00:24.133 --> 00:00:26.100

Same Day Policy Cancellation

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:30.566
The next day, it was announced that Liu Peng was unfinished.

10
00:00:31.533 --> 00:00:32.866
He's cutting the leeks.

11
00:00:34.533 --> 00:00:35.800
Upper half of the family

12
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.766
Because of this

13
00:00:38.733 --> 00:00:40.033
Burdened with huge loans

14
00:00:41.166 --> 00:00:42.633
Come on a windy day

15
00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.966
Boss Xu, it's really unkind of you to do this

16
00:00:53.266 --> 00:00:56.100
The enemy's money is paid with blood and sweat

17
00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.466
Why are they not angry when you do this?

18
00:00:58.466 --> 00:00:59.700
Oops seventh uncle

19
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.266
Who the hell are you?

20
00:01:02.366 --> 00:01:03.500
You are a ghost

21
00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:04.800
You don't take him first

22
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.300
You blame me in turn

23
00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:07.100
Ah!

24
00:01:07.766 --> 00:01:09.400
Heaven and earth have their own justice

25
00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.200
I will not be biased because of the people and ghosts

26
00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.666
I suggest you hurry up and let the real estate resume work

27
00:01:15.666 --> 00:01:17.100
Hand over the house as agreed

28
00:01:17.366 --> 00:01:19.100
Resolved their grievances

29
00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.666
You'll be fine.

30
00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.100
Real estate resumes work

31
00:01:23.266 --> 00:01:24.666
Easy for you to say.

32
00:01:24.666 --> 00:01:25.733
sue

33
00:01:25.733 --> 00:01:28.533
It will cost at least tens of billions to resume work on the real estate.

34
00:01:28.533 --> 00:01:31.233
Ah, this money is rough for you

35
00:01:31.566 --> 00:01:34.866
Boss Xu, you are worth tens of billions

36
00:01:35.066 --> 00:01:37.800
Billions is nothing to you

37
00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.066
Hahaha can't stand it

38
00:01:41.166 --> 00:01:43.200
Do you understand the law?

39
00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.933
The company's money is the company's money

40
00:01:44.933 --> 00:01:46.900
My money is my money

41
00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:48.533
The company's building is not finished

42
00:01:48.533 --> 00:01:50.300
Just take my money and top it inside

43
00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:51.900
Why should I do this?
