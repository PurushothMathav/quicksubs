00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.266
Master, are you still thinking about that evil thing?

2
00:00:03.966 --> 00:00:05.500
The devil child in Fengmen Village

3
00:00:05.933 --> 00:00:07.366
no small matter

4
00:00:07.466 --> 00:00:08.833
And that Xu Bingyan

5
00:00:09.166 --> 00:00:10.766
Also a little heavy

6
00:00:11.933 --> 00:00:14.000
If the two of them join forces

7
00:00:14.266 --> 00:00:16.033
I'm afraid no one is an opponent

8
00:00:17.066 --> 00:00:17.866
Hey

9
00:00:19.166 --> 00:00:22.900
Don't you always tell me what kind of master your master is?

10
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.400
Why do you frown when you encounter something?

11
00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.400
I don't think he's very capable

12
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.800
As expected of a charlatan

13
00:00:30.866 --> 00:00:32.700
Don't say that my master is not good?

14
00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.100
Oh, I see.

15
00:00:35.766 --> 00:00:36.566
please

16
00:00:38.266 --> 00:00:39.566
You don't want it?

17
00:00:40.333 --> 00:00:41.600
Give me a break.

18
00:00:42.133 --> 00:00:43.433
I beg you.

19
00:00:44.366 --> 00:00:46.100
Master, what's wrong?

20
00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:48.900
Oh, no. He's suffering from evil.

21
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.366
Hey master

22
00:00:50.366 --> 00:00:53.100
People may just be listening to the phone with a bluetooth headset

23
00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.900
Where did so many evil ears come from?

24
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.033
Why can't I see? Hmm.

25
00:00:58.066 --> 00:01:00.833
There are three sisters and foreign fire on people's bodies

26
00:01:01.166 --> 00:01:03.233
One sister on each pointed head

27
00:01:03.366 --> 00:01:04.966
With these three sisters

28
00:01:05.333 --> 00:01:07.266
Ghosts are afraid to approach

29
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:08.666
Only sadness

30
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.733
People who are seriously ill or desperate

31
00:01:10.733 --> 00:01:12.233
Sanmei Yanghuo is weak

32
00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:13.866
Ghosts will haunt

33
00:01:13.866 --> 00:01:15.800
So you can see him?

34
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.466
Hey, say

35
00:01:17.666 --> 00:01:19.900
What does Evil Spike look like?

36
00:01:19.933 --> 00:01:22.866
I really want to see your Bixin that night

37
00:01:23.166 --> 00:01:24.500
Didn't you see

38
00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.266
Compare the heart, what is the heart?

39
00:01:28.566 --> 00:01:30.166
Why can't I remember?
