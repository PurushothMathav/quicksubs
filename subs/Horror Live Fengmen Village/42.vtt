00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:01.000
Great master

2
00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.266
As you expected

3
00:00:02.266 --> 00:00:04.000
Yuqing really held back the devil

4
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Maybe he's just too lonely.

5
00:00:07.333 --> 00:00:08.566
That's not right, master

6
00:00:08.566 --> 00:00:10.000
I remember Boss Feng saying

7
00:00:10.066 --> 00:00:12.533
The family art was poisoned by Xu Bingyan himself

8
00:00:12.533 --> 00:00:14.633
Shouldn't he hate his mother?

9
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.766
It's not that simple.

10
00:00:17.966 --> 00:00:20.800
What the crazy boss says may not be the whole truth

11
00:00:21.133 --> 00:00:22.000
Is he really a ghost?

12
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.533
Ghosts also come to the live stream, and ghosts collide with ghosts to scare people.

13
00:00:24.533 --> 00:00:26.366
Don't talk nonsense in the live stream.

14
00:00:26.466 --> 00:00:27.266
nonsense

15
00:00:27.966 --> 00:00:33.000
I was born on July 15, 1983.

16
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Died in August 1989

17
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.700
I was poisoned by sleeping pills

18
00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.666
What's the matter? Is everyone afraid of me?

19
00:00:43.666 --> 00:00:45.766
There are many people who have never seen a ghost

20
00:00:45.766 --> 00:00:48.033
Let's meet today

21
00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:49.333
Are you really a ghost?

22
00:00:49.333 --> 00:00:51.066
That's cool. I'm speeding it up.

23
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.566
The number of people in the live stream has actually risen to more than 8,000

24
00:00:54.733 --> 00:00:56.266
Are you all crazy?

25
00:00:56.266 --> 00:00:57.400
Go back to sleep.

26
00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:58.900
Really don't be on top of others

27
00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:00.433
I beg you.
