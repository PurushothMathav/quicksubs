00:00:00.466 --> 00:00:02.433
Come, come, come, give him to me, come on

2
00:00:02.966 --> 00:00:05.833
Hey, hey, hey, I'm you.

3
00:00:07.366 --> 00:00:08.166
And so forth.

4
00:00:08.966 --> 00:00:09.733
This gentleman

5
00:00:09.733 --> 00:00:11.266
Have something to say

6
00:00:11.333 --> 00:00:12.366
Why are you doing it?

7
00:00:12.366 --> 00:00:13.166
Who the hell are you?

8
00:00:13.166 --> 00:00:15.200
Who the hell are you?

9
00:00:15.866 --> 00:00:19.466
Xu Shuangyin, the founder of BGI Real Estate

10
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.666
Fenger Village is my development zone

11
00:00:22.666 --> 00:00:25.333
I already fucking bought this land

12
00:00:25.333 --> 00:00:27.900
It's just that you mountain cannon have nothing to do with Linyi live broadcast here.

13
00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.133
So many people died, right?

14
00:00:29.133 --> 00:00:30.900
Look at Lao Tzu's apology, you can't demolish it

15
00:00:32.733 --> 00:00:34.766
Are you Boss Xue?

16
00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:35.533
Depressed calf thing

17
00:00:35.533 --> 00:00:37.266
See if I don't kill you, I'll wait

18
00:00:37.966 --> 00:00:39.000
You old boy

19
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:39.966
I go up

20
00:00:39.966 --> 00:00:41.066
Don't give me nonsense

21
00:00:41.066 --> 00:00:42.766
If you talk nonsense, I will find you together.

22
00:00:42.766 --> 00:00:45.200
I'm a mage invited by Boss Feng

23
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.600
I'm here to break the curse of Fengmen Village

24
00:00:48.266 --> 00:00:49.666
You are a mage

25
00:00:52.333 --> 00:00:53.433
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

26
00:00:53.533 --> 00:00:54.833
He is the seventh uncle

27
00:00:54.866 --> 00:00:56.466
Spell hook wall

28
00:00:56.466 --> 00:00:58.366
I invited him here specifically

29
00:00:58.366 --> 00:01:00.866
It was the broken shoe in Fengmen Village.

30
00:01:00.866 --> 00:01:01.666
Snow boss

31
00:01:01.666 --> 00:01:04.866
There were 108 left-behind elderly people living in Fengmen Village before

32
00:01:04.933 --> 00:01:06.900
Now it is a deserted village without an owner

33
00:01:06.933 --> 00:01:08.933
You also save the demolition and the decree is abolished

34
00:01:08.933 --> 00:01:10.733
As long as you get rid of that evil sin

35
00:01:10.733 --> 00:01:13.300
It's not necessarily a bad thing for you
