00:00:00.966 --> 00:00:01.800
What!

2
00:00:02.533 --> 00:00:03.466
No way.

3
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.600
Who do you think I am?

4
00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:11.033
Don't be nervous.

5
00:00:11.266 --> 00:00:12.366
Think about it.

6
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.600
We have no guarantee or mortgage after repairing the loan.

7
00:00:15.933 --> 00:00:19.366
How can we ensure that customers repay on time?

8
00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.733
I took a few photos of you to avoid risks.

9
00:00:22.733 --> 00:00:26.400
If you don't pay off the loan by then

10
00:00:26.666 --> 00:00:28.500
We'll send the photo.

11
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.500
Hey, but don't worry.

12
00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.866
If you can repay on time

13
00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:34.366
I promise you

14
00:00:34.566 --> 00:00:37.800
Your photo will never be seen by a third person.

15
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:38.600
Ah!

16
00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:42.033
No, I can't. I'm 18.

17
00:00:42.066 --> 00:00:44.866
I can't do that. Okay?

18
00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.166
Can't pay tuition

19
00:00:49.733 --> 00:00:52.366
If you can go to school, you will be kicked out of school.

20
00:00:52.533 --> 00:00:55.500
Classmates will also look down on you

21
00:00:55.733 --> 00:00:59.333
Your parents worked hard to raise you

22
00:00:59.333 --> 00:01:00.800
You go to school.

23
00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.633
You got kicked out of school.

24
00:01:02.933 --> 00:01:06.100
How miserable and sad are they?

25
00:01:12.966 --> 00:01:14.166
Can you really guarantee

26
00:01:14.166 --> 00:01:15.900
Won't the photo be leaked?

27
00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.466
Oops, don't worry, hahahaha.

28
00:01:21.333 --> 00:01:23.166
Brother, your brother has the same personality.

29
00:01:23.366 --> 00:01:27.900
I will never use your photos.

30
00:01:29.766 --> 00:01:32.266
Ok I shoot

31
00:01:34.533 --> 00:01:35.333
madam
