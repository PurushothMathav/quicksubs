00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:04.166
Master Zhang's soul solicits customers with a ghost car

2
00:00:04.266 --> 00:00:06.533
Will he be like that female ghost in red?

3
00:00:06.533 --> 00:00:07.566
Harm is human

4
00:00:07.566 --> 00:00:10.533
Don't worry, Zhang's heart is pure and kind

5
00:00:10.533 --> 00:00:11.566
No evil

6
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.200
Wait until he finishes his obsession

7
00:00:13.333 --> 00:00:15.566
The soul naturally dissipates

8
00:00:18.566 --> 00:00:21.266
Your master is really a good man.

9
00:00:21.266 --> 00:00:24.666
I admire him more and more now. Why?

10
00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.266
Now don't say that my master is a charlatan

11
00:00:28.266 --> 00:00:29.666
I didn't say that.

12
00:00:32.766 --> 00:00:35.166
What? My live alarm clock.

13
00:00:36.933 --> 00:00:39.000
Why did my live stream open by itself?

14
00:00:45.733 --> 00:00:46.466
How is that possible?

15
00:00:46.466 --> 00:00:48.133
Haven't the live stream account been blocked?

16
00:00:48.133 --> 00:00:51.033
Isn't the Haunted House in Fengwen Village also sealed?

17
00:00:51.066 --> 00:00:51.966
Who is live?

18
00:00:51.966 --> 00:00:54.400
Is it the evil sin?

19
00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.400
Okay, turn off the live stream.
