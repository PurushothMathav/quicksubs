Xu Lianlian

2
00:00:03.066 --> 00:00:04.100
I want to pay back

3
00:00:11.166 --> 00:00:12.366
What?

4
00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:15.000
This is the money I earned from working part-time during the summer vacation.

5
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:15.866
Still a deposit

6
00:00:21.466 --> 00:00:22.466
Not enough.

7
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.100
It's not enough. I already ordered it twice.

8
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:27.433
If you don't believe me, count it.

9
00:00:27.933 --> 00:00:29.800
Ah yes, and that interest

10
00:00:29.866 --> 00:00:32.466
8 cents a day without borrowing more than 90 articles

11
00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.000
Well, let's count it by 100 days

12
00:00:35.266 --> 00:00:36.900
8 yuan for 100 days

13
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:39.833
Here's 10 bucks.

14
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.266
Don't look for it, hahaha.

15
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.966
Hahaha ok

16
00:00:46.966 --> 00:00:49.066
What are you laughing at?

17
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:56.300
I'll tell you what 8 points of daily interest is

18
00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:01.700
Just every day it's eight percent, 97 percent is 720 percent.

19
00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.400
You owe me 30,000 six grand

20
00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.733
Hahaha what is impossible

21
00:01:07.733 --> 00:01:08.633
That's not possible.

22
00:01:08.866 --> 00:01:10.400
It's written on the wind

23
00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.766
Hey

24
00:01:13.766 --> 00:01:18.000
You see, this contract is clearly written

25
00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:21.833
The black letter on the paper is because you didn't see it clearly.

26
00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:24.000
Don't blame me

27
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.400
Hahahaha

28
00:01:27.533 --> 00:01:29.700
Didn't tell me the interest rate was so high at all

29
00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:31.866
How to calculate, it should be that the grandson is kind.

30
00:01:35.166 --> 00:01:36.433
This is obviously usury
