1
00:00:00.666 --> 00:00:02.833
Uncle singular or even

2
00:00:04.333 --> 00:00:06.666
Double and even numbers

3
00:00:10.733 --> 00:00:12.300
Oh my god I'm so scary

4
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.266
I can't take my life away

5
00:00:14.533 --> 00:00:16.866
Why did the number of people in the live stream halve?

6
00:00:16.866 --> 00:00:17.933
That's impossible.

7
00:00:17.933 --> 00:00:20.600
Mom, you chose even numbers.

8
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:23.933
Anyone who even stared at the live stream is dead

9
00:00:23.933 --> 00:00:26.366
What did I kill?

10
00:00:29.066 --> 00:00:33.466
You wouldn't lie if you killed their mother

11
00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.400
You devil why did you kill them

12
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:41.033
Mom, don't you like my magic tricks?

13
00:00:42.866 --> 00:00:44.700
You are a weak demon

14
00:00:44.733 --> 00:00:46.266
You used me

15
00:00:46.266 --> 00:00:48.400
You use the number of people in my live stream.

16
00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.300
You want to kill more people

17
00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.333
Why did you kill them?

18
00:00:52.333 --> 00:00:53.566
What's wrong with them?

19
00:00:53.566 --> 00:00:55.466
What's wrong with someone who doesn't make mistakes?

20
00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:57.600
I'm not your mother.

21
00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.866
You're already dead. Damn it

22
00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.266
That's been dead for over 30 years

23
00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.000
I don't want you anymore.
