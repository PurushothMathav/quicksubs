00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:01.066
How?

2
00:00:12.666 --> 00:00:15.166
Soul Lock Town is a good thing

3
00:00:15.166 --> 00:00:15.966
master

4
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.433
Can Soul Lock Town really seal the devil child?

5
00:00:19.733 --> 00:00:22.900
Soul Lock Town formerly known as Seven Evil Soul Town

6
00:00:23.266 --> 00:00:24.666
By the devil

7
00:00:24.666 --> 00:00:25.666
Crawling coolies

8
00:00:26.266 --> 00:00:27.566
Seven Demons

9
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.600
It was the most vicious death in the world

10
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.966
The ghosts in the trapped town are tortured by the Seven Demons day and night

11
00:00:33.966 --> 00:00:35.666
Until the soul is gone

12
00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:37.600
Later

13
00:00:37.966 --> 00:00:40.833
Some virtuous people have conducted political and legal affairs

14
00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.600
No deception is specially punished for me

15
00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:45.433
A lot less sinister power

16
00:00:46.133 --> 00:00:50.600
But it can also be called the most severe formation in the right path.

17
00:00:50.766 --> 00:00:51.566
Wow

18
00:00:52.166 --> 00:00:54.600
The previous Gui Hong was miserable

19
00:00:56.533 --> 00:00:57.600
But master

20
00:00:57.933 --> 00:01:02.100
We use such a cruel array to treat children

21
00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.166
Isn't that too cruel?

22
00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:06.833
Hey

23
00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.066
He was angry.

24
00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:10.466
Unable to resolve

25
00:01:10.933 --> 00:01:13.300
There is no way.

26
00:01:13.666 --> 00:01:14.500
seventh uncle

27
00:01:14.866 --> 00:01:18.033
The letter from home is actually a very poor child

28
00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:21.766
30 years ago, Xu Binyan was imprisoned in a dilapidated house

29
00:01:21.933 --> 00:01:24.033
Perhaps he is desperate for life

30
00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.100
He lied to his family to buy medicine

31
00:01:26.333 --> 00:01:27.933
But the letter home was only 6 years old at the time

32
00:01:27.933 --> 00:01:30.033
He didn't even know it was sleeping pills

33
00:01:30.466 --> 00:01:32.633
Later, Xu Bing committed suicide by drinking medicine

34
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.500
The letter from home always felt that he killed his mother

35
00:01:37.566 --> 00:01:39.066
I see

36
00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.700
Now the truth is completely clear

37
00:01:44.366 --> 00:01:46.033
I went to investigate Xu Bingyan

38
00:01:46.133 --> 00:01:47.666
He was originally a college student

39
00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.066
He was trafficked to a Buddhist village
