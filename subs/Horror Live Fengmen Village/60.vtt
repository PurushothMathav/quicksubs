00:00:00.666 --> 00:00:03.600
What is the sausage method?

2
00:00:04.566 --> 00:00:08.266
Hey, it's 12 o'clock every night.

3
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.366
He came to my house on time and knocked on the door.

4
00:00:10.366 --> 00:00:11.800
Then we

5
00:00:12.733 --> 00:00:15.100
500 on that straw.

6
00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:16.200
Use words to pay off debt

7
00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:20.400
What are you doing with such a wicked thing?

8
00:00:21.166 --> 00:00:23.833
Oops, what happened later?

9
00:00:24.133 --> 00:00:26.166
How did he die?

10
00:00:26.166 --> 00:00:27.000
You killed him

11
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.266
No, no, no, how could I possibly kill him?

12
00:00:29.266 --> 00:00:31.066
If I kill him, who will pay my debt?

13
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:33.833
Then how did he become a female ghost?

14
00:00:36.966 --> 00:00:40.433
Tell the truth or he'll come to you again

15
00:00:40.666 --> 00:00:42.266
I say I say

16
00:00:43.966 --> 00:00:46.666
Later, the emperor took a fancy to him

17
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.800
Said to let you accompany him at night

18
00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:50.500
I went with him

19
00:00:50.966 --> 00:00:53.700
Who knew I wasn't a pervert either?

20
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.966
She raped him that night.

21
00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:57.966
Cut off the head

22
00:01:00.066 --> 00:01:01.100
Oh, dear.

23
00:01:02.933 --> 00:01:04.466
What a sin

24
00:01:05.566 --> 00:01:06.866
Since then?

25
00:01:06.866 --> 00:01:09.700
Come and knock on my door at 12 o'clock every night

26
00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.600
Hey, this is the station.

27
00:01:11.666 --> 00:01:14.000
You said it wasn't me who killed him

28
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.166
Why are you pestering me?

29
00:01:15.166 --> 00:01:16.166
What does it have to do with me?

30
00:01:16.166 --> 00:01:17.566
Are you right?

31
00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.066
Even if you didn't kill him

32
00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.766
He also died because of you

33
00:01:21.766 --> 00:01:25.100
You can't even cross and dry to death. He's not looking for you. Who are you looking for?

34
00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.000
Then seventh uncle, hurry up and chase me

35
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.766
I literally get killed by them every night.

36
00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:31.966
I can help you too.

37
00:01:31.966 --> 00:01:33.566
But you have to promise me one condition.
