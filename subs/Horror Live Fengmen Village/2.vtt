00:00:00.733 --> 00:00:02.366
Oops, can't comb your hair

2
00:00:02.366 --> 00:00:04.033
Oops master

3
00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:05.900
It's just a game

4
00:00:06.266 --> 00:00:07.366
These ghosts!

5
00:00:07.366 --> 00:00:08.400
It's all done by others

6
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:09.900
Do you think so?

7
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.266
What do you know?

8
00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:13.833
This person has three fears of foreign fire

9
00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:17.233
Midnight is when foreign fire needs it most

10
00:00:17.466 --> 00:00:20.466
Combing your hair at this time will put out the foreign fire above your head

11
00:00:20.533 --> 00:00:22.000
Easily provoked by ghosts

12
00:00:22.333 --> 00:00:24.233
Call him and turn off the live stream

13
00:00:24.366 --> 00:00:27.000
Otherwise, I will die for sure.

14
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.466
Really ok

15
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.200
I'll call him now.

16
00:00:37.066 --> 00:00:38.200
No one answered?

17
00:00:38.866 --> 00:00:41.066
Go to Fengmen Village

18
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.300
Family heard that combing your hair in the mirror at 12 midnight

19
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.066
You can see yourself in past lives

20
00:01:05.066 --> 00:01:07.100
Let's check it out together.

21
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.233
One Comb Gas Pass

22
00:01:11.966 --> 00:01:15.600
Two Combs Quiet Ghosts

23
00:01:15.933 --> 00:01:19.966
Sansuo's past and present life

24
00:01:24.166 --> 00:01:24.966
I still do

25
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.233
Nothing.

26
00:01:29.066 --> 00:01:31.800
The family has lost face and nothing

27
00:01:32.133 --> 00:01:33.133
Say hey

28
00:01:33.133 --> 00:01:33.666
So boring

29
00:01:33.666 --> 00:01:34.600
Didn't you say there were ghosts?

30
00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.100
Trick me to come to the live stream to spoil the fun

31
00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:37.533
Hey, family, don't go back

32
00:01:37.533 --> 00:01:39.133
I'm almost at number one.

33
00:01:39.133 --> 00:01:41.066
Don't back down, we can perform anything now

34
00:01:41.066 --> 00:01:42.966
Say it right now, okay?

35
00:01:43.133 --> 00:01:44.966
Why don't you please go first?

36
00:01:44.966 --> 00:01:46.100
Please go first please go first

37
00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.166
Please compete first.

38
00:01:49.133 --> 00:01:52.033
The Pen Spirit is a ghost

39
00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:53.600
