00:00:00.666 --> 00:00:05.000
Xu Bingyan, you said that woman's name was Xu Bingyan

2
00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:08.200
Later, when Fang Jiashu was 6 years old

3
00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:10.133
Xu Bingyan suddenly went crazy

4
00:00:10.133 --> 00:00:13.400
He killed his own son with sleeping pills

5
00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.900
Then he took sleeping pills and died

6
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:16.900
After that?

7
00:00:16.966 --> 00:00:19.966
Her husband's husband is dead, dead, crazy.

8
00:00:19.966 --> 00:00:21.166
Since then

9
00:00:21.166 --> 00:00:24.800
The legend of the haunted by the wind begins

10
00:00:25.166 --> 00:00:27.966
How could a woman poison her own child?

11
00:00:27.966 --> 00:00:29.166
So I say

12
00:00:29.166 --> 00:00:31.700
Did everyone in the village say that this person was possessed by evil?

13
00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:33.566
It's night time.

14
00:00:33.566 --> 00:00:36.966
Everyone in the village can see Xu Bienian's ghost

15
00:00:36.966 --> 00:00:38.700
So scary

16
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.666
Everything that can be moved out of this village has been moved out

17
00:00:41.666 --> 00:00:44.166
Leave those 108 people behind

18
00:00:44.166 --> 00:00:46.766
Most of them are left-behind elderly

19
00:00:46.766 --> 00:00:49.033
I don't think it's that simple

20
00:00:49.366 --> 00:00:50.366
Xu Bingyan

21
00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:51.966
Boss Feng

22
00:00:51.966 --> 00:00:54.200
Do you know where this woman lives?

23
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.466
I heard that it is the Xujialou of the city

24
00:00:57.933 --> 00:00:59.600
After all these years?

25
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.266
And a brother to take care of her

26
00:01:01.266 --> 00:01:04.166
What is it called Xu Youde?

27
00:01:04.966 --> 00:01:08.000
The master seems to want to solve Xu Bingyan's matter

28
00:01:08.066 --> 00:01:09.766
We must find Void Poison

29
00:01:09.966 --> 00:01:12.066
May be the only one who knows the truth

30
00:01:12.266 --> 00:01:13.866
But the world is so big

31
00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:15.466
How hard is it to find someone?

32
00:01:15.466 --> 00:01:16.433
Fang dare to say

33
00:01:17.566 --> 00:01:18.966
Who are Moments?

34
00:01:18.966 --> 00:01:20.066
I am.

35
00:01:20.666 --> 00:01:21.900
What are you looking for me for?

36
00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.066
You fuck

37
00:01:23.066 --> 00:01:24.366
Just you scumbag

38
00:01:24.366 --> 00:01:25.966
It's okay to do a supernatural live broadcast here, right?

39
00:01:25.966 --> 00:01:27.866
Who the hell are you?
