00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:03.666
Well, if I didn't meet you, it's your chance.

2
00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:07.266
But since I met him, it means he shouldn't die

3
00:00:07.266 --> 00:00:08.966
Go find another stand-in

4
00:00:09.133 --> 00:00:10.300
No stand-ins

5
00:00:11.266 --> 00:00:12.700
I want him dead.

6
00:00:13.466 --> 00:00:15.100
What's your grudge against him?

7
00:00:15.366 --> 00:00:17.800
Say it and I will do justice for you

8
00:00:18.066 --> 00:00:19.400
Me and my husband

9
00:00:19.766 --> 00:00:21.666
I used to have a happy home

10
00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:24.433
Then the business failed

11
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.166
Huge debt

12
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.066
I suffered from depression because of it

13
00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.966
I made an appointment with my husband to get rich and die together

14
00:00:34.466 --> 00:00:37.033
Wife goodbye

15
00:00:37.466 --> 00:00:38.866
If there is a next life

16
00:00:39.133 --> 00:00:40.500
We are still husband and wife

17
00:00:41.866 --> 00:00:44.033
Thank you, husband.

18
00:01:02.666 --> 00:01:03.533
Sorry wife

19
00:01:03.533 --> 00:01:04.900
I don't want to die yet.

20
00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:17.800
It's your husband who lost you.

21
00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.166
What does it have to do with him?

22
00:01:19.566 --> 00:01:21.600
Let go of your obsession and go to life

23
00:01:21.966 --> 00:01:23.500
I only found out later

24
00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.233
It turns out that my husband lied to me about his death

25
00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.233
It is because the family does not have this marriage letter.

26
00:01:29.266 --> 00:01:31.366
Ren Gong men and women in order to be together

27
00:01:31.866 --> 00:01:33.700
We have no shortage of Han slaves

28
00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.900
Finally killed my child
