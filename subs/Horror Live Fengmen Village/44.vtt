00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:03.400
Are you talking about the male live streaming host from before?

2
00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:05.366
Yes, I did.

3
00:00:05.366 --> 00:00:06.766
Why kill him?

4
00:00:06.766 --> 00:00:08.666
He is courting death

5
00:00:08.666 --> 00:00:10.266
He asked me to kill him

6
00:00:10.266 --> 00:00:13.533
I've never seen such a stupid request in my life

7
00:00:13.533 --> 00:00:14.900
What about the 1,000 people before that?

8
00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:16.100
What did they do wrong again?

9
00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:17.133
They are all wrong

10
00:00:17.133 --> 00:00:18.700
They are all dead

11
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.766
What a powerful gas palm

12
00:00:21.766 --> 00:00:24.300
He won't kill us, will he?

13
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.100
No, don't provoke him.

14
00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:27.800
Otherwise it will be bad

15
00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.100
Haha, my military doctor has no complaints

16
00:00:32.666 --> 00:00:33.133
Ah, good.

17
00:00:33.133 --> 00:00:35.800
Family, we won't talk about these unhappy things today.

18
00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.400
Accelerate your visit to our live stream.

19
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.000
Everyone is happy, right?

20
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.733
But some family members have to go to work tomorrow

21
00:00:41.733 --> 00:00:44.000
So I will use our live stream today.

22
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.933
So far.

23
00:00:44.933 --> 00:00:45.800
How about speeding up?

24
00:00:47.066 --> 00:00:48.000
Don't go off the air.

25
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.266
It's hard to see a real ghost

26
00:00:50.266 --> 00:00:51.466
Come and get talent

27
00:00:51.466 --> 00:00:52.166
Hurry up

28
00:00:52.166 --> 00:00:56.133
This is not an appointment with your mother, a bunch of bastards who are not afraid of death

29
00:00:56.133 --> 00:00:58.566
Haha, what are you kidding?

30
00:00:58.566 --> 00:01:01.766
Our family can't perform talents?
