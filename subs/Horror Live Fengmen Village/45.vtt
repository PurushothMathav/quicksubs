00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:02.666
Haha, what are you kidding?

2
00:00:02.666 --> 00:00:05.800
Our family can't perform talents?

3
00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:08.400
No, I will.

4
00:00:08.666 --> 00:00:11.400
So, what kind of talent do you perform?

5
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.766
Mom, I can do a magic trick.

6
00:00:13.766 --> 00:00:15.800
Do you prefer singular or even numbers?

7
00:00:16.566 --> 00:00:19.533
Ah, I, I, I can do it.

8
00:00:19.533 --> 00:00:21.166
singular or even

9
00:00:21.166 --> 00:00:22.066
Say it

10
00:00:22.866 --> 00:00:24.600
singular even

11
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.300
What is he trying to do?

12
00:00:26.366 --> 00:00:29.400
Maybe it's a game

13
00:00:31.966 --> 00:00:34.966
These damn fans are just courting death

14
00:00:34.966 --> 00:00:36.600
Epidemic desperately wants to shut down the live stream

15
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.133
These fans have been up and down endlessly

16
00:00:39.133 --> 00:00:40.166
seek death

17
00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:43.466
No, please call and let the friendship close.

18
00:00:43.466 --> 00:00:44.266
Hey

19
00:00:47.733 --> 00:00:49.666
The subscriber you dialed cannot be reached

20
00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.900
Master Wang's phone can't get through.

21
00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.500
Oh, no.

22
00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.033
We are all grown up
