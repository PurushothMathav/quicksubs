1
00:00:00.466 --> 00:00:01.300
Who doesn't know your son?

2
00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:02.866
Became the rich man's door-to-door son-in-law

3
00:00:02.966 --> 00:00:04.266
Stop pretending to be poor

4
00:00:04.366 --> 00:00:05.833
This big brother

5
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.466
Don't clean up our house

6
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:12.333
We'd be homeless for real.

7
00:00:12.333 --> 00:00:14.433
Written in black and white

8
00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:16.800
If you can't pay back the money, take the house to pay off the debt

9
00:00:18.466 --> 00:00:19.266
Mom

10
00:00:19.466 --> 00:00:20.633
What's wrong?

11
00:00:20.933 --> 00:00:23.666
And here's the big brother with the IOU.

12
00:00:23.866 --> 00:00:25.633
Say you haven't paid back the money you borrowed

13
00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:27.800
Let's pay off the house

14
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:28.700
What IOU?

15
00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:29.566
Let me see it.

16
00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:36.733
This IOU is written

17
00:00:36.733 --> 00:00:38.166
If I don't pay you back on time

18
00:00:38.166 --> 00:00:39.333
You can deduct me once.

19
00:00:39.333 --> 00:00:41.166
But we've already paid the money back

20
00:00:41.733 --> 00:00:44.266
Pay off the interest

21
00:00:44.333 --> 00:00:45.600
Do you want to pay the interest?

22
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.633
Do you want to give the question to the question?

23
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.066
Impossible Impossible

24
00:00:51.133 --> 00:00:52.900
Then I'll destroy this house

25
00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:54.666
Anyway, it's worth one square meter.
