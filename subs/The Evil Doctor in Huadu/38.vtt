00:00:00.533 --> 00:00:01.900
Who looks good on you?

2
00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:03.766
Tang Huan, why are you here?

3
00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:06.466
I rent this house. Of course I'm here

4
00:00:07.366 --> 00:00:09.666
You did rent this house

5
00:00:09.666 --> 00:00:11.600
Why don't you just leave it here and talk to you?

6
00:00:11.733 --> 00:00:14.900
Repay, do something, I advise you to be the harshest condition

7
00:00:16.333 --> 00:00:17.600
The more you talk, the more interested I am.

8
00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:20.866
Hey girl, I'll transfer you 100,000 dollars

9
00:00:20.866 --> 00:00:22.300
This is a ten-year gambler

10
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:23.466
What if it's not enough?

11
00:00:23.466 --> 00:00:25.033
We will slowly transfer you to Mr. Zhang

12
00:00:25.666 --> 00:00:26.900
I know yours.

13
00:00:26.933 --> 00:00:28.666
Mr. Zhang, you will never be able to afford it

14
00:00:28.666 --> 00:00:29.966
I bah

15
00:00:29.966 --> 00:00:31.300
The person behind you

16
00:00:31.366 --> 00:00:33.900
I tell you it's best not to mess with our Zhao family

17
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:35.866
Otherwise you know the consequences

18
00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:38.566
Tell him which one to apologize for

19
00:00:39.566 --> 00:00:42.033
The entire provincial capital can still use a few tricks

20
00:00:42.333 --> 00:00:44.166
They're not here today.

21
00:00:44.166 --> 00:00:45.566
I'm in a good mood.

22
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.233
I don't care about you

23
00:00:47.366 --> 00:00:49.700
If you still don't know

24
00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.233
Be careful I let you walk around

25
00:00:54.166 --> 00:00:55.100
We'll see.

26
00:00:56.733 --> 00:00:58.833
Girl, I can't believe your background is quite hard

27
00:00:59.766 --> 00:01:01.033
Here's 100,000 dollar, take a look first

28
00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.566
No need for such a brother

29
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.866
You saved me and you saved my grandfather

30
00:01:05.966 --> 00:01:07.366
Thank you for coming back with me

31
00:01:07.666 --> 00:01:08.700
Then why?

32
00:01:09.266 --> 00:01:10.300
It's nothing.

33
00:01:10.333 --> 00:01:12.466
Come on. Come home with me.

34
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.733
Grandpa has long wanted you to sit down

35
00:01:14.733 --> 00:01:17.166
If only he knew I saw you today

36
00:01:17.166 --> 00:01:18.500
Haven't brought you back yet

37
00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.466
Do you want me to be scolded?
