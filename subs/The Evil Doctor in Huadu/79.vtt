00:00:00.466 --> 00:00:02.133
What did you drive?

2
00:00:02.133 --> 00:00:03.433
Is Mr. Zhang Fan here?

3
00:00:04.266 --> 00:00:05.066
To see a doctor

4
00:00:08.533 --> 00:00:11.566
Oh, uncle, is it you?

5
00:00:11.566 --> 00:00:12.500
How are the legs?

6
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.666
As soon as our community says

7
00:00:15.133 --> 00:00:16.900
Your legs are really good.

8
00:00:17.133 --> 00:00:19.866
Some fish seem a little expensive.

9
00:00:19.966 --> 00:00:22.366
But the fish is bigger than you this time.

10
00:00:22.566 --> 00:00:23.866
Don't say it

11
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.166
You don't say a good painting, just look at it and you'll understand

12
00:00:28.933 --> 00:00:30.266
What you said makes sense.

13
00:00:30.466 --> 00:00:31.866
Then I'll sell it to your dad.

14
00:00:31.866 --> 00:00:34.000
It will be placed tomorrow. It really needs to be more convenient.

15
00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:35.133
No no no no

16
00:00:35.133 --> 00:00:36.133
Not even the pulse

17
00:00:36.133 --> 00:00:36.933
Mom

18
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.400
You uncle

19
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.000
Come to the doctor and say nothing

20
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Don't ask anything

21
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.700
You don't even want to feel your pulse

22
00:00:42.933 --> 00:00:44.266
How do you speak?

23
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.300
Chinese medicine pays attention to looking, hearing and asking

24
00:00:48.166 --> 00:00:49.233
number one

25
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.966
Wow, you can't even practice well.

26
00:00:52.366 --> 00:00:52.800
Right?

27
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.366
How can you practice well?

28
00:00:55.266 --> 00:00:56.766
Aren't you making things difficult for people?

29
00:00:56.766 --> 00:00:59.300
If you don't want to see a doctor, you can go home as soon as possible.

30
00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:01.566
How do you say it?

31
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.466
Your lady trust me
