00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:01.766
That's great, Sister Cher

2
00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:05.433
Well, you can lend me your husband.

3
00:00:05.666 --> 00:00:06.466
What!

4
00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:10.400
No, Sister Cher, don't get me wrong.

5
00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.466
I just want him to help me call my sick uncle

6
00:00:13.533 --> 00:00:14.600
Do you know him?

7
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.066
You go and help him see you

8
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.866
You girl are not hands

9
00:00:21.166 --> 00:00:24.466
Oh, Sister Cher, I'm not a child anymore.

10
00:00:24.866 --> 00:00:26.433
When you held a wedding reception

11
00:00:26.566 --> 00:00:28.100
I was also at that hotel

12
00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:30.466
I was in a hurry to leave

13
00:00:30.466 --> 00:00:31.900
Fortunately, your husband is here

14
00:00:31.933 --> 00:00:33.433
Otherwise I'm done

15
00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:34.566
go to bed

16
00:00:35.366 --> 00:00:36.833
I think you got the wrong person

17
00:00:37.066 --> 00:00:37.733
Where's my husband?

18
00:00:37.733 --> 00:00:39.300
Although a young man

19
00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.900
But he was an ordinary rural man.

20
00:00:42.566 --> 00:00:44.000
Didn't even graduate from college

21
00:00:44.533 --> 00:00:46.400
What not?

22
00:00:47.066 --> 00:00:48.300
Why would I lie to you?

23
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.166
Be as powerful as you say

24
00:00:50.166 --> 00:00:51.900
Why did I resist in the first place?

25
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:53.733
You don't know

26
00:00:53.733 --> 00:00:55.366
If it weren't for my mother's death

27
00:00:55.566 --> 00:00:56.666
I won't marry you

28
00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.833
He and I are from two different worlds at all

29
00:01:00.533 --> 00:01:03.833
It doesn't seem like it from you

30
00:01:04.666 --> 00:01:07.466
I don't know why he can't lock me up

31
00:01:07.466 --> 00:01:08.900
Can't get in touch with him

32
00:01:08.933 --> 00:01:11.200
So I want to try my luck with you

33
00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.733
Stinky girl

34
00:01:15.733 --> 00:01:17.066
What do I think you're hearing about him?

35
00:01:17.066 --> 00:01:17.966
Not after my husband

36
00:01:17.966 --> 00:01:19.033
So happy

37
00:01:19.133 --> 00:01:20.200
No.

38
00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:22.066
So be it.

39
00:01:22.066 --> 00:01:23.866
Tell my sister what his name is

40
00:01:23.866 --> 00:01:24.900
Sister, help you find it.

41
00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.500
He called the firefighters.

42
00:01:28.666 --> 00:01:29.966
What's his name?
