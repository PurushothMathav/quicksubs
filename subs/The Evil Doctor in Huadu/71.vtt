00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:01.966
No need for you

2
00:00:01.966 --> 00:00:05.000
Ouch, you can really blow.

3
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.500
I'm not afraid of the wind hurting my tongue

4
00:00:11.666 --> 00:00:14.566
If you can eat well, you are sick

5
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.733
Not only do you not have to close for a while

6
00:00:16.733 --> 00:00:18.600
You can still get my admiration.

7
00:00:19.566 --> 00:00:20.900
What are you looking at?

8
00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:22.133
Look at your face

9
00:00:22.133 --> 00:00:24.600
My art is better than yours. Can I use you?

10
00:00:25.366 --> 00:00:26.166
Hey

11
00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:27.766
I see you are not satisfied

12
00:00:27.766 --> 00:00:29.433
How about we make a bet?

13
00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.566
What will the clothes do?

14
00:00:31.666 --> 00:00:33.200
I bet I can't cure him

15
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.900
If I cure you, get off this street

16
00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:37.266
If I don't get cured

17
00:00:37.266 --> 00:00:38.766
I quit this street

18
00:00:38.766 --> 00:00:40.700
How is it?

19
00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.400
Xiaofan oops

20
00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.100
Thank you for being a doctor

21
00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:47.600
Ouch, dare to kill him

22
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.866
What's the matter, you dare not

23
00:00:52.666 --> 00:00:54.100
Who wouldn't dare?

24
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.200
If you can't cure it in one minute, get out of here

25
00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:58.200
The day I just said clearly

26
00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.033
How did it become a minute?

27
00:01:00.166 --> 00:01:01.566
You are really a rascal

28
00:01:01.866 --> 00:01:05.366
A minute is the smallest thing, not me humming

29
00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.200
If you're afraid, mix it up
