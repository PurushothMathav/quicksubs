00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:03.300
Pay back the money, who the hell owes you money?

2
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.633
Levin, I'm begging you, Levin

3
00:00:05.733 --> 00:00:06.533
Levin

4
00:00:07.333 --> 00:00:08.833
That's disgusting. Go away

5
00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:12.500
It's just social trash like you.

6
00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.500
I'm sorry, is it death?

7
00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:16.433
What the hell is the point of me living?

8
00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:20.200
Bangs, you trash this

9
00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:21.766
Are you happy?

10
00:00:21.966 --> 00:00:24.666
Bangs, please give me the money back.

11
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.466
Brother Bing, be gentle

12
00:00:34.466 --> 00:00:36.200
Soldiers also exploded

13
00:00:37.966 --> 00:00:38.766
nurse

14
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.100
Please I beg you

15
00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:44.866
I beg you.

16
00:00:45.133 --> 00:00:46.166
Where are you going with my mom?

17
00:00:46.166 --> 00:00:47.533
You owe the drug bill for more than a month

18
00:00:47.533 --> 00:00:49.100
You think my hospital is doing charity

19
00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:50.666
If you don't have any money, get out of here

20
00:00:50.666 --> 00:00:52.133
You can relieve me for a few more days, just a few more days.

21
00:00:52.133 --> 00:00:53.466
I must go out and borrow money

22
00:00:53.533 --> 00:00:55.700
Turn right when you go out and benefit from 51 days

23
00:00:55.933 --> 00:00:57.900
Don't be so big, or I'll come back later.

24
00:00:58.066 --> 00:00:58.866
Come on.

25
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.366
Mom, how are you?

26
00:01:03.466 --> 00:01:05.400
We're not going.

27
00:01:05.666 --> 00:01:09.433
Go home and take you down
