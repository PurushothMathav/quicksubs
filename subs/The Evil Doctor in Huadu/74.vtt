00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:01.700
You dream

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.033
Hey, don't be angry with the villain.

3
00:00:07.766 --> 00:00:11.300
You told me again that I came here to spend money and give you money.

4
00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:13.000
Don't come

5
00:00:14.733 --> 00:00:16.200
It's not enough to hurt me

6
00:00:17.466 --> 00:00:19.266
Framed me for my little brother who cured me

7
00:00:19.266 --> 00:00:20.700
I tell you to dream

8
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.233
Look at your virtue, are you still worthy of opening an instrument shop?

9
00:00:25.333 --> 00:00:26.933
You didn't play to frame people

10
00:00:26.933 --> 00:00:28.200
You you

11
00:00:28.866 --> 00:00:30.566
You can't get the fuck up

12
00:00:32.333 --> 00:00:33.933
Hey, take a look.

13
00:00:33.933 --> 00:00:36.133
I knew there was something wrong with this guy's quality

14
00:00:36.133 --> 00:00:38.266
Do you think this not only comes out after use?

15
00:00:38.266 --> 00:00:41.966
Ouch, you didn't want to see him, think about it

16
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.666
Mom, this house is amazing.

17
00:00:51.766 --> 00:00:53.000
Like some people

18
00:00:53.866 --> 00:00:55.300
I don't understand

19
00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.700
You dare to quit the little demon in the building where they live

20
00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:59.866
Ruined my leg

21
00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:01.633
Where are you going if you have the ability?

22
00:01:02.666 --> 00:01:04.533
Yeah, he's a swimsuit.

23
00:01:04.533 --> 00:01:07.266
Are there any other houses besides the houses that hurt people?

24
00:01:07.766 --> 00:01:08.900
Take advantage of the red flower

25
00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:12.933
Liu Bo, where do you want to hide?

26
00:01:12.933 --> 00:01:15.000
Did you know that your father was bullied?
