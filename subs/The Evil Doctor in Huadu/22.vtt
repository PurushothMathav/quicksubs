00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:04.200
We plan to live in the provincial capital tomorrow

2
00:00:04.666 --> 00:00:07.433
Xiaoxue is also going back to work in the company

3
00:00:07.733 --> 00:00:10.200
Mom, I heard you went to college for a few years

4
00:00:10.733 --> 00:00:12.400
I wanted to take you to the hospital again

5
00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:13.833
What do you think?

6
00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:16.433
Mom, thank you.

7
00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:19.033
But I have no plans to go to college.

8
00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:21.966
I'm not going there. What do you want?

9
00:00:22.566 --> 00:00:25.900
Can you tell your mother what's on your heart?

10
00:00:26.866 --> 00:00:28.700
Mom, I want to do crafts

11
00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:29.500
eat

12
00:00:30.133 --> 00:00:32.233
Craft what craft do you have

13
00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:33.466
No diploma

14
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.266
You can only go out and move bricks

15
00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.500
What's wrong with moving bricks?

16
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.466
How many babysitters are the worst for working people?

17
00:00:39.466 --> 00:00:40.600
How does everybody feel?

18
00:00:42.266 --> 00:00:44.500
I'll tell you I won't agree anyway

19
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.566
This kid should have a temper

20
00:00:49.366 --> 00:00:52.033
Ah, why is Xiaoxue so good?

21
00:00:58.333 --> 00:00:59.566
What about this card?

22
00:00:59.566 --> 00:01:02.433
200,000 20 for you right away

23
00:01:02.866 --> 00:01:04.566
The password is six zeros.

24
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.400
With this money?

25
00:01:06.533 --> 00:01:08.166
Stay here and take care of you

26
00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:09.600
It's more convenient.

27
00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:11.666
hide

28
00:01:14.866 --> 00:01:15.700
For what?

29
00:01:22.166 --> 00:01:23.833
What's wrong with not loving mom?

30
00:01:26.166 --> 00:01:27.500
I'll be right back

31
00:01:28.466 --> 00:01:30.400
Mom, let me go home
