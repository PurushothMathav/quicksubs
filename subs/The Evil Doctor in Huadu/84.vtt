00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:02.100
Look, here comes the trouble

2
00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.266
I'm afraid this trouble will not end

3
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:09.466
Dad, dad, get out of here

4
00:00:12.933 --> 00:00:13.733
chairperson

5
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.100
What's going on?

6
00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:18.566
Look how you treated my car

7
00:00:19.333 --> 00:00:22.466
No, I'll give it to you when you leave.

8
00:00:22.466 --> 00:00:23.566
What is ok

9
00:00:23.566 --> 00:00:24.833
I'll be honest with you

10
00:00:24.966 --> 00:00:26.366
We didn't even take the money.

11
00:00:26.366 --> 00:00:27.466
What watch do we move?

12
00:00:27.733 --> 00:00:31.100
The money was confiscated because you are guilty of being a thief.

13
00:00:31.966 --> 00:00:34.266
Could it be that you still go to see a doctor for free?

14
00:00:34.366 --> 00:00:36.666
Besides, you are a doctor

15
00:00:36.933 --> 00:00:39.266
Could it be Charity Hall?

16
00:00:39.266 --> 00:00:40.933
We do prescribe medical care

17
00:00:40.933 --> 00:00:43.800
But I treat the common people at the lowest cost

18
00:00:43.866 --> 00:00:46.200
And I made this for free.

19
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.733
Your uncle drinks it too

20
00:00:47.733 --> 00:00:49.866
Hmph, who's putting bear medicine here?

21
00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.100
You just let the patient drink and get sick

22
00:00:53.366 --> 00:00:55.366
If you are sick, you have to be treated

23
00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.233
You are interested in my brother's property

24
00:00:58.566 --> 00:01:00.300
It's just a small hollowed-out property
