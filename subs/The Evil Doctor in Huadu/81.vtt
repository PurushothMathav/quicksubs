00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:02.066
Right. You want to know?

2
00:00:02.066 --> 00:00:04.033
Then I'll tell you now

3
00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:06.766
All right, I'm all ears.

4
00:00:06.766 --> 00:00:07.866
Are you sick?

5
00:00:07.866 --> 00:00:08.933
As it turns out

6
00:00:08.933 --> 00:00:09.833
What!

7
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.466
Wild is that you didn't work much when you were young

8
00:00:12.466 --> 00:00:14.133
It's okay if the brain doesn't get sick

9
00:00:14.133 --> 00:00:16.766
Once you get sick, all the left sides of the head are like being pricked by needles.

10
00:00:16.766 --> 00:00:18.033
I was right.

11
00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:21.433
You're talking nonsense. I don't have that disease at all.

12
00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.200
I would rather come to see a doctor than let people take the pulse, just look at it.

13
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:25.866
If you want to confirm

14
00:00:25.866 --> 00:00:27.666
Let him take your pulse

15
00:00:27.966 --> 00:00:29.866
I won't let you take my pulse

16
00:00:29.866 --> 00:00:32.300
You will die of this heart

17
00:00:32.466 --> 00:00:35.300
It's the kind of subdivided migraine I was talking about.
