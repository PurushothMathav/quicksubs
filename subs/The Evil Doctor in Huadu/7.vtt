00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.966
I like it hahahaha I scream I will kill you

2
00:00:03.966 --> 00:00:04.766
you

3
00:00:05.166 --> 00:00:06.200
Not me.

4
00:00:07.066 --> 00:00:09.100
I like to ride hunting horses

5
00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:11.100
Sit down and get out

6
00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:13.400
That bridal chamber is our local joy

7
00:00:13.766 --> 00:00:16.866
I treated you naively, but your heart has changed.

8
00:00:16.866 --> 00:00:18.500
Someone in casual clothes is coming to rescue you

9
00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:24.233
elder brother

10
00:00:25.266 --> 00:00:26.700
Isn't it so good?

11
00:00:26.766 --> 00:00:28.566
Good things are not called brothers

12
00:00:28.933 --> 00:00:30.566
You just now, I just watched it.

13
00:00:30.566 --> 00:00:32.800
Only omnipotent women will marry your trash

14
00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:35.466
What a beautiful woman they are

15
00:00:35.466 --> 00:00:37.133
Then you really married a beautiful woman

16
00:00:37.133 --> 00:00:38.933
Enough, have you made enough trouble?

17
00:00:38.933 --> 00:00:40.900
Help! Help!

18
00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:41.800
bitch

19
00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.500
You can accept two kinds of teams

20
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.500
It's none of your business whether we accept him or not

21
00:00:47.666 --> 00:00:49.500
Dry run, I know I'm going to call the police

22
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.000
What's the use of calling the police?

23
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.366
We are a reasonable bridal chamber

24
00:00:53.366 --> 00:00:55.166
Will the police care about us?

25
00:00:55.166 --> 00:00:57.600
Auntie, the fool is pretty

26
00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.466
It's an evil way to round the house for this trash

27
00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:01.366
How to fix it or not

28
00:01:02.266 --> 00:01:04.866
Brother, let's take turns

29
00:01:04.866 --> 00:01:07.066
Ok you go on

30
00:01:07.466 --> 00:01:08.700
Just watch.

31
00:01:08.866 --> 00:01:10.766
Cousin is definitely not a good thing

32
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.133
He is a treasure if the dog wants it or not

33
00:01:13.133 --> 00:01:14.600
Then I'll come first

34
00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.300
Come on, I'll kill you

35
00:01:18.133 --> 00:01:18.933
Ah!

36
00:01:19.066 --> 00:01:19.866
Hey

37
00:01:24.566 --> 00:01:26.100
Ah, the potion!

38
00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.766
You're not a damn picky eater, are you?

39
00:01:27.766 --> 00:01:30.966
By the way, is your medicine jar mother dead?

40
00:01:30.966 --> 00:01:32.066
Ask me for money all day

41
00:01:32.066 --> 00:01:34.400
I'm sick of it. Do I have a problem with you?

42
00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:43.100
Old Hu'er

43
00:01:43.866 --> 00:01:45.466
Wang family girl rolls the red flag

44
00:01:48.133 --> 00:01:50.766
You should cherish it, boy.

45
00:01:50.766 --> 00:01:55.000
I will teach us a unique skill today

46
00:01:57.766 --> 00:02:00.366
Wounds for the benefit of all

47
00:02:00.466 --> 00:02:05.000
This includes the creation of angels of righteousness
