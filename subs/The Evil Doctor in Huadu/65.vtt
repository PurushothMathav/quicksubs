00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.300
Where did you get the yellow-haired girl?

2
00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:05.866
My grandfather's illness is much worse than yours

3
00:00:05.866 --> 00:00:07.466
It was cured by the accountant brother

4
00:00:07.466 --> 00:00:10.366
Now he is healthier than a young man

5
00:00:10.533 --> 00:00:11.800
Who told you big talk?

6
00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:13.066
Blow me

7
00:00:13.166 --> 00:00:14.666
You applaud

8
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.600
It takes effect to be persuasive

9
00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:17.700
It's useless to talk too much

10
00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:20.400
Ouch, this sentence makes you right.

11
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.533
You saw the effect today

12
00:00:22.533 --> 00:00:24.833
This uncle is not sick

13
00:00:24.933 --> 00:00:26.600
It's cured now

14
00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:27.666
What does that mean?

15
00:00:27.666 --> 00:00:30.100
It means that my art is better than yours

16
00:00:30.266 --> 00:00:32.900
Don't you open any pussy house?

17
00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:34.566
There were only 4 people in Tina

18
00:00:34.566 --> 00:00:37.600
If the account is not transferred by then, it will not be easy to appear.

19
00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.433
Hmph you are talking nonsense

20
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.166
My brother was stronger than you just now

21
00:00:41.466 --> 00:00:42.700
Scammers selling counterfeit drugs

22
00:00:43.666 --> 00:00:44.666
bounce around

23
00:00:44.766 --> 00:00:47.133
Are you talking nonsense and being slaughtered casually?

24
00:00:47.133 --> 00:00:49.500
But I sue you in the north, do you have any evidence?
