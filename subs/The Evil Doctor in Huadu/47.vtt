00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:01.700
I have one question though.

2
00:00:04.266 --> 00:00:05.566
Are you married?

3
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.266
Hey, grandpa, why are you asking people about this privacy?

4
00:00:10.366 --> 00:00:12.733
Okay, normal brother, hurry up and leave.

5
00:00:12.733 --> 00:00:14.666
Otherwise my grandpa will talk more later

6
00:00:17.866 --> 00:00:18.966
Grandpa

7
00:00:19.966 --> 00:00:21.266
What are you doing?

8
00:00:21.533 --> 00:00:23.766
What are you doing pushing such a nice guy out?

9
00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:24.600
Grandpa

10
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.033
The long brother seems to be Sister Cher's husband

11
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.066
Last time I participated in the company's liquor store because of

12
00:00:31.566 --> 00:00:33.766
I didn't go to become Sister Cher's big night

13
00:00:34.133 --> 00:00:36.666
We seem to be still in the same hotel

14
00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.033
I still met Brother Huang there

15
00:00:39.566 --> 00:00:41.100
That girl from the Wang family

16
00:00:41.933 --> 00:00:42.933
Don't pick men

17
00:00:42.933 --> 00:00:44.300
It's a good match.

18
00:00:44.966 --> 00:00:46.833
I'm not sure yet?

19
00:00:47.133 --> 00:00:48.433
Try harder.

20
00:00:48.966 --> 00:00:51.400
Try to bring her back to the morning market

21
00:00:52.366 --> 00:00:53.900
You ignored it

22
00:01:02.533 --> 00:01:05.700
Zhang Fan, we also work hard every day.

23
00:01:05.766 --> 00:01:07.333
Please don't come back for dinner in the future

24
00:01:07.333 --> 00:01:08.200
You say

25
00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.266
You don't answer the phone

26
00:01:09.266 --> 00:01:10.500
I don't know what you're up to

27
00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:11.733
My phone is on silent.

28
00:01:11.733 --> 00:01:13.000
You don't have to prepare dinner for me anymore

29
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.066
I'll eat out.

30
00:01:14.066 --> 00:01:15.433
Eating out?

31
00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.800
Really think our money is blown by the wind

32
00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.000
Let you squander at will

33
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.700
I never said I eat on my own

34
00:01:26.266 --> 00:01:29.100
Mom, look at him like that, you don't care about him

35
00:01:29.566 --> 00:01:30.900
I see.

36
00:01:30.966 --> 00:01:34.066
But he is related to our family, I understand today

37
00:01:34.266 --> 00:01:36.433
I said his company

38
00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.533
Mom, I'm just asking you to make rules for him

39
00:01:40.533 --> 00:01:42.200
Didn't say what to do

40
00:01:42.366 --> 00:01:43.700
If it really doesn't work

41
00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:45.200
Let's stop together

42
00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:48.800
Anyway, when he comes back tomorrow

43
00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:49.800
I won't let you in

44
00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.166
Yes, it really shouldn't be their rules
