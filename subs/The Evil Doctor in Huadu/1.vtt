00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:03.300
You are not allowed to leave after using it up today.

2
00:00:06.666 --> 00:00:07.966
My Boyfriend

3
00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:10.133
Hello

4
00:00:10.133 --> 00:00:12.000
Didn't I tell you not to call me?

5
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.533
Am I delivering takeout during the day?

6
00:00:13.533 --> 00:00:15.033
My mom needs care in the hospital

7
00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.133
Why don't you go to the hospital and change my mom's diaper?

8
00:00:17.133 --> 00:00:18.633
I'm out on a business trip

9
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.166
Wenwen, are you on a business trip?

10
00:00:20.333 --> 00:00:21.700
Zhang Fang, let me tell you

11
00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:23.666
Can you let me tell mom you can take care of it yourself

12
00:00:23.666 --> 00:00:25.800
Don't bother me at work

13
00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:30.866
I'm really good at writing fools

14
00:00:31.666 --> 00:00:34.400
No, your boyfriend hasn't broken up yet.

15
00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:36.966
Isn't this going to be divided soon?

16
00:00:36.966 --> 00:00:40.066
A lot of money for fucking treatment is in my account

17
00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.900
In this way, I don't have to be true to the queen in the future

18
00:00:43.333 --> 00:00:44.433
Oops

19
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:48.566
The takeout I gave arrived.

20
00:00:49.866 --> 00:00:51.600
It's easy to work when you're full

21
00:00:51.733 --> 00:00:53.233
Brother Bin, where am I going?

22
00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:03.500
slowly

23
00:01:04.066 --> 00:01:05.800
Didn't you go on a business trip?

24
00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:07.033
How does it end here?

25
00:01:07.266 --> 00:01:09.366
Zhang San, why do you care so much?

26
00:01:09.366 --> 00:01:12.400
Send you takeout, you idiot

27
00:01:14.066 --> 00:01:14.866
Hello

28
00:01:15.333 --> 00:01:18.033
You can match my boyfriend with this one

29
00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:19.966
You actually green me

30
00:01:19.966 --> 00:01:21.600
Look at your poverty

31
00:01:21.766 --> 00:01:23.100
Isn't it a green turtle?

32
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.500
Japanese I like you so much

33
00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.400
Do I do something I'm sorry for you?

34
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.566
So what if you are nice to me?

35
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.300
Look at your poverty

36
00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:31.766
From head to toe, what is worse than a soldier?

37
00:01:31.766 --> 00:01:32.600
Okay, okay.

38
00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:34.066
Stop arguing.

39
00:01:34.333 --> 00:01:36.266
Your girlfriend takes care of herself for two days

40
00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.000
I'll pay you back when I run out.

41
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.433
I'll fucking kill you

42
00:01:48.866 --> 00:01:50.233
Dare to fuck me

43
00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:51.500
This one.

44
00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:53.600
You are not good for me

45
00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.300
But your father and my mother have money to pay you back from the surgery.

46
00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.900
My mom is still waiting on the operating table
