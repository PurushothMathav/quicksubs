00:00:09.666 --> 00:00:12.133
The user you dialed is temporarily unavailable

2
00:00:12.133 --> 00:00:13.133
Or turned off

3
00:00:13.133 --> 00:00:15.066
If you want to leave a message, please press one.

4
00:00:16.333 --> 00:00:18.700
Why is it still turned off?

5
00:00:35.966 --> 00:00:37.800
Is Manager Wang busy?

6
00:00:38.533 --> 00:00:41.266
Shuangshuang is your girl, right?

7
00:00:41.366 --> 00:00:43.700
Sister Cher, you are too amazing

8
00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:45.600
Come and sit down, our relatives will know to collect it.

9
00:00:49.766 --> 00:00:51.700
You didn't come to my wedding reception last time

10
00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:53.000
You missed me so much!

11
00:00:53.666 --> 00:00:54.966
It's all my dad's fault

12
00:00:54.966 --> 00:00:56.766
Obviously his liquor store

13
00:00:56.866 --> 00:00:59.100
He ran away and told me to go to the top

14
00:00:59.133 --> 00:01:00.600
Hey, I've seen a fool

15
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.833
So it's the first time I've seen my daughter

16
00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:05.500
Be careful your dad listens and spanks you

17
00:01:05.533 --> 00:01:07.000
Hmph, I'm not afraid

18
00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:08.366
Ok, both.

19
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.500
What are you here for today?

20
00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:11.833
You stinky girl

21
00:01:11.933 --> 00:01:13.266
Everything goes to the Three Treasures Hall

22
00:01:14.133 --> 00:01:16.200
Sister Cher, you wronged me

23
00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.900
Well, is there anything wrong with your company?

24
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:19.800
No.

25
00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.033
It's not the company's business for me to find you

26
00:01:23.133 --> 00:01:25.666
It's a personal thing. It's a personal thing.

27
00:01:25.733 --> 00:01:27.366
Then tell my sister

28
00:01:27.366 --> 00:01:28.666
What exactly is it?

29
00:01:28.666 --> 00:01:30.300
Sister must do her best to help you

30
00:01:30.966 --> 00:01:32.233
That's great, Sister Cher

31
00:01:32.466 --> 00:01:36.100
Well, you can lend me your husband.
