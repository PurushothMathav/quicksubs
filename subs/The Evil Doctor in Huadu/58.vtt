1
00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:03.366
He didn't come back just now.

2
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.133
What does he mean?

3
00:00:07.133 --> 00:00:10.366
Haven't you bought it again now?

4
00:00:10.466 --> 00:00:13.000
Did you go too far yesterday?

5
00:00:13.966 --> 00:00:15.666
Knocked on my room last night

6
00:00:15.666 --> 00:00:18.033
I never really drove him to Wanli Road

7
00:00:19.533 --> 00:00:20.533
That's impossible.

8
00:00:20.533 --> 00:00:21.833
He has no money either

9
00:00:22.333 --> 00:00:23.166
Didn't forget him

10
00:00:23.166 --> 00:00:25.466
If you gave him a 100,000 dollar bank card

11
00:00:26.566 --> 00:00:28.766
Well, then don't give it to him.

12
00:00:29.266 --> 00:00:31.466
Then freeze that card for him tomorrow

13
00:00:31.466 --> 00:00:32.833
See what he can do

14
00:00:40.466 --> 00:00:42.600
Buy the vegetables and put them here

15
00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:45.766
How can I feel distressed when I talk to the dead?
