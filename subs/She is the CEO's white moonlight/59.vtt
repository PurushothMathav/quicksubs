00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:02.260
What age is it now?

2
00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:05.060
When these young people are in love

3
00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:06.660
Something bad happens.

4
00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:08.100
That's impossible.

5
00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:09.740
With my understanding that I don't play

6
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.260
He won't touch a woman he doesn't like.

7
00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:14.220
Who knows what you're up to

8
00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:18.340
Brother Ming Chen, drink the medicine, and I'll get you fruit.

9
00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.500
Okay? No more. No more

10
00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.140
Let's eat first

11
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.780
Mr. Ji, you should be in better health today, right?

12
00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.480
He looks in good spirits.

13
00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:43.980
Of course!

14
00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.220
With my nourishment and care

15
00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:49.020
The three of you will get better and better

16
00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:51.780
Since I didn't eat, I'm relieved

17
00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.040
I won't eat breakfast

18
00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.620
Contact me if you feel uncomfortable

19
00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:59.840
Hey, Dr. Chen is here

20
00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:01.100
Go after breakfast

21
00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.000
You must have not eaten when you came here early this morning

22
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.140
Although my mother is divorced

23
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.740
You can stay and have breakfast together, okay?

24
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.780
Super brother eat more

25
00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.340
Are you exhausted last night?

26
00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:17.460
Replenish the body

27
00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.960
Qin Xiaojuan eats well

28
00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:21.460
Who do these tricks for?

29
00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.540
My son just came out

30
00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:24.820
You're just tossing

31
00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:27.500
I don't think you have a good heart at all

32
00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:31.420
Just to do our best, we care about something.

33
00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.300
I can't eat without this

34
00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.220
Come on, sir. Let's eat out.
