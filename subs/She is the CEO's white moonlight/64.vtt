00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:05.040
How can you go so far?

2
00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.520
This is no place for people like you

3
00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:09.280
If you bump into our guest of honor

4
00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:10.920
We lost a lot of business

5
00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.040
You can't pay with your life

6
00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:13.320
Didn't you say it?

7
00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.180
I prove I don't know

8
00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:16.080
Okay, okay.

9
00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:16.880
Go away now

10
00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.460
If you don't leave, I'm going to call security

11
00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.480
What's all the noise over there?

12
00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.540
It seems that there is a woman who can't afford clothes and has to try it on

13
00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.320
Help me wrap all the clothes just now

14
00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:29.260
I'll go take a look. Okay.

15
00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:32.400
Get out of here

16
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:33.960
Why are you still on the ground?

17
00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.560
Are you trying to corrupt me, you samba?

18
00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:40.440
Is this how your clothing store treats customers? Isn't that so, Mrs. Liu?

19
00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.780
It's this woman who can't afford one of your clothes and still has to try it on.

20
00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.620
Mrs. Jiang Mrs. Jiang

21
00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.560
I bought all the clothes he likes for him.

22
00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:53.560
Mrs. Liu, do you still need to know?

23
00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:55.440
Of course he's my friend.

24
00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:56.200
Be polite to him

25
00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.440
Don't put on a dog-eyed face that looks at people low

26
00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.480
Hey, sorry, sorry.

27
00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.360
Mrs. Liu didn't expect you to know him

28
00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:02.400
This is the clothes from the store.

29
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:03.520
You can choose whatever you want.

30
00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:05.040
No, you're fired.

31
00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.460
Mrs. Liu, let me go quickly

32
00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.240
Mrs. Jiang is really nice

33
00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.340
I didn't expect you to be alive
