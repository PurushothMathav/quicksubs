00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:01.240
Who are you?

2
00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:02.180
aunt

3
00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:08.780
You don't know your father so soon, are you going to be that daughter and leave as a police officer?

4
00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:11.160
I really don't even know your biological parents anymore

5
00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:12.160
No need for a housekeeper

6
00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:13.900
You weren't sisters either

7
00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.460
You are Sister Qin's tooth print

8
00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.500
Sister Qin's parents don't have much sincerity for you either

9
00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:20.460
You are my biological father

10
00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.060
What about my mother? This girl doesn't know her mother is dead

11
00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:26.380
Could it be that

12
00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:27.960
Yes

13
00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:33.320
Mom is waiting for you at home

14
00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.260
Come on. Follow me home.

15
00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:36.320
And so forth.

16
00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:38.580
If you were my biological father

17
00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.180
Then how did I become the adopted daughter of the invited family?

18
00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:42.840
You abandoned me.

19
00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.220
That's a long story.

20
00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:46.700
It's all your mother's business

21
00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.020
You go home with me and ask your mother

22
00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:51.560
Oh.

23
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.420
You have a red mole on your shoulder.

24
00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.040
I'm not your father

25
00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:58.180
How could I know?

26
00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:00.260
You really are my dad

27
00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:01.900
Tell me about it.

28
00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:03.620
Come on. Go home.

29
00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.420
If I keep Meng Meng here

30
00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.940
Go to the chicken house and ask for money

31
00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:26.860
Is it better to be bitten?

32
00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.200
And that's how you managed your childhood.

33
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.620
Do you remember anything?

34
00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.340
There is indeed a familiar feeling

35
00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.280
Ah go

36
00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:45.740
I'll take you to see the place where you loved to play hide and seek since you were a child. Go ahead
