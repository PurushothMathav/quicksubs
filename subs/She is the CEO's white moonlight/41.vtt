00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:04.820
Xiaoyu, you said that if you were obedient and married me

2
00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:06.460
How nice

3
00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:09.300
It won't end up like this

4
00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:12.620
The doctor said you might become a vegetable

5
00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:16.500
You don't have to live like this

6
00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:18.540
It's better to die and keep it

7
00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.020
Okay?

8
00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:28.320
You won't get sleepy.

9
00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:30.580
Okay?

10
00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:46.420
Little Rain

11
00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.000
How did you wake up?

12
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.580
I just tucked you in

13
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.800
you

14
00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:52.620
Who are you?

15
00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:55.420
You don't know me anymore.

16
00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.060
I don't remember anything.

17
00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:04.300
mine

18
00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.140
I don't know anything.

19
00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:09.140
I don't know anything.

20
00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.180
If you can't remember, don't think about it.

21
00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:15.260
You just need to remember that I am your fiancÃ©

22
00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.980
We're getting married soon.

23
00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:18.500
No talent

24
00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.980
Yes, we have a good relationship.

25
00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:23.860
We are already planning for the wedding.

26
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.420
Who knew you were suddenly in a car accident?

27
00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.540
You said you might become a vegetable

28
00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:31.120
For a moment my heart was broken

29
00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:34.500
Is everything you said true?
