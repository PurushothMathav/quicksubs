00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:04.340
Brother Chen, I'm a little hungry

2
00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.420
Ok I'll take you to eat

3
00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:09.440
It can't be so coincidental

4
00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:12.420
Is Ji Lingchuan really the big brother when he was a child?

5
00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:16.500
Why is my necklace missing?

6
00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:17.980
Bought your favorite neighborhood

7
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.200
I made a special trip for you

8
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.180
You can ask what works Youan Ning sends.

9
00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:27.780
Where are you going? You are Mr. Ji's subordinate

10
00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:29.120
Without his orders

11
00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:30.880
You can only wait here for him to come back.

12
00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:32.760
I am his family doctor

13
00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:33.940
Not a maid

14
00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.840
Mr. Ji is looking at money

15
00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.860
Good health is not needed for you for the time being.

16
00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.700
Don't you know that Ji always has asthma?

17
00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:42.580
He could need a doctor at any time

18
00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:44.060
Xinlingchuan has asthma

19
00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:47.380
Why else would you need a family doctor?

20
00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:49.700
Could it be that you really think he likes you?

21
00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.300
I have something important to do now, and I don't have time to waste saliva with you.

22
00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.620
Mr. Ji has found his white moonlight

23
00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.560
Even if you save him

24
00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:00.220
He won't give you a second look

25
00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:05.580
Keep this to yourself

26
00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.180
It will shine in decades.
