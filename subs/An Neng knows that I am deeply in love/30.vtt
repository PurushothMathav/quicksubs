00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:03.833
Husband, you said you wanted to surprise me.

2
00:00:04.066 --> 00:00:06.766
Just ask me in front of everyone

3
00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:09.466
You've changed. What do you want?

4
00:00:13.366 --> 00:00:15.900
I'm divorcing Linmer

5
00:00:16.066 --> 00:00:18.933
It's interesting to follow the river and demolish the bridge

6
00:00:18.933 --> 00:00:21.466
How can Mr. Lin be so ruthless?

7
00:00:21.466 --> 00:00:22.566
Should leave

8
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.366
I was also forced

9
00:00:24.466 --> 00:00:26.266
After Linmer returned from suicide

10
00:00:26.466 --> 00:00:27.800
Temperament destruction

11
00:00:29.366 --> 00:00:30.900
You are tyrannical

12
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.466
Murder relatives

13
00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.933
I'm no longer the Limer I loved so much

14
00:00:34.933 --> 00:00:36.566
Since I'm so unbearable

15
00:00:36.766 --> 00:00:39.933
Then why don't you before I give you Lin's?

16
00:00:39.933 --> 00:00:41.466
Kick me away

17
00:00:43.933 --> 00:00:45.166
I had hoped to influence you

18
00:00:45.166 --> 00:00:46.700
But you make it worse.

19
00:00:47.133 --> 00:00:48.866
For the future of the Lin Group

20
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.400
So that I won't be the next victim

21
00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:54.300
That's all I had to do.

22
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.100
Lin Meng

23
00:00:55.566 --> 00:00:57.100
You wouldn't have attempted suicide.

24
00:00:57.966 --> 00:00:59.366
Are you mentally ill?

25
00:00:59.366 --> 00:01:03.333
Women should be at home with their husbands and children

26
00:01:03.333 --> 00:01:04.700
Why not match?

27
00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.266
It's long overdue to step down as president

28
00:01:07.266 --> 00:01:08.866
Are you sure you want a divorce?
