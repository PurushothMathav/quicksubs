1
00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:02.166
The divorce papers weren't signed by me

2
00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:03.733
So invalid

3
00:00:03.733 --> 00:00:05.200
Oh, yes.

4
00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.500
If this divorce agreement is annulled

5
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.866
Can the contract be re-signed?

6
00:00:09.866 --> 00:00:10.800
Right.

7
00:00:11.133 --> 00:00:13.766
The 100 billion order is still from our Lin's Group.

8
00:00:13.766 --> 00:00:15.466
Hahaha Liu Te Zhu

9
00:00:15.466 --> 00:00:18.000
In my current capacity, I can sign the contract

10
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.866
The president of the Shure Group

11
00:00:19.933 --> 00:00:21.500
You can't break your word, can you?

12
00:00:21.566 --> 00:00:23.400
Good sign

13
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.266
President, this signed order and Lin's are still mine.

14
00:00:27.266 --> 00:00:29.166
Then in what capacity do you sign with me?

15
00:00:29.166 --> 00:00:30.066
What do you mean?

16
00:00:30.066 --> 00:00:32.966
In the identity of Lin's Group Zhuixu

17
00:00:32.966 --> 00:00:35.566
As the president of the Emgrand Group

18
00:00:35.566 --> 00:00:37.000
Emgrand Group

19
00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.100
Husband, what the hell is going on?
