1
00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:01.566
It's not Linmer.

2
00:00:04.533 --> 00:00:06.566
I am Limmer

3
00:00:06.566 --> 00:00:09.133
This person doesn't look like Mr. Kobayashi

4
00:00:09.133 --> 00:00:11.666
All of us here have met Mr. Kobayashi

5
00:00:11.666 --> 00:00:14.033
Do you think we are fools?

6
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:15.600
I can prove it.

7
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.900
This is the real daughter of Lin's by my side

8
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.166
What the hell is going on?

9
00:00:21.166 --> 00:00:22.666
Ah, hey, this

10
00:00:25.933 --> 00:00:27.233
Who are you?

11
00:00:27.666 --> 00:00:29.233
Why are you pretending to be me?

12
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:30.900
Steal my husband

13
00:00:31.066 --> 00:00:33.400
Sister sister is still alive

14
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.066
You are Li Mo

15
00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:36.866
How is it?

16
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.433
You remember that?

17
00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:40.600
My wedding with Shixian

18
00:00:40.733 --> 00:00:41.800
Of course I remember

19
00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.633
It was the most luxurious wedding ever uptown

20
00:00:44.866 --> 00:00:47.133
At that time, the lady of tens of billions married the poor boy

21
00:00:47.133 --> 00:00:48.533
But it caused a sensation in the whole city.

22
00:00:48.533 --> 00:00:50.100
Then you must remember

23
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.800
My father gave me a pair of bracelets at that time

24
00:00:55.166 --> 00:00:56.866
He Shixian is right

25
00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:57.800
That pair of bracelets

26
00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.500
But the world's top jewelry master

27
00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:00.566
Made by hand

28
00:01:00.566 --> 00:01:02.366
This is the only set in the world.

29
00:01:02.533 --> 00:01:04.233
One of the bracelets.

30
00:01:05.466 --> 00:01:06.466
Here I am.
