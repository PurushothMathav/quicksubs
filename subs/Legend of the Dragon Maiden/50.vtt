00:00:05.666 --> 00:00:08.200
Brother, why are you so disobedient?

2
00:00:08.266 --> 00:00:11.133
I was so badly injured before that I didn't have a good rest.

3
00:00:11.133 --> 00:00:12.666
I'm still practicing here

4
00:00:14.266 --> 00:00:15.900
Junior sister, why are you here?

5
00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:19.366
I'll bring you ointment

6
00:00:24.133 --> 00:00:24.933
Thank you, sister

7
00:00:25.366 --> 00:00:27.766
Zhang Yi, help me get my clothes

8
00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:28.766
No, nothing else.

9
00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.633
I'll change the medicine for you first, and then get dressed.

10
00:00:31.933 --> 00:00:32.800
Hey junior sister

11
00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:34.500
Men and women are inexhaustible

12
00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.300
And I'm not telling you this.

13
00:00:38.666 --> 00:00:41.200
Are you the senior brother who grew up with me?

14
00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.633
Also take into account male and female fat walking

15
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.866
Only the three girls can persuade the general

16
00:00:54.766 --> 00:00:55.900
Fortunately, I'm here.

17
00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:58.633
Otherwise, when will you get better like this?

18
00:01:00.466 --> 00:01:01.266
Junior Sister

19
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.566
Ah, I'll do it myself

20
00:01:05.733 --> 00:01:06.633
Ah!

21
00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:11.100
senior brother

22
00:01:11.533 --> 00:01:14.633
Why are you unhappy today?

23
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.100
I'm not unhappy.

24
00:01:20.066 --> 00:01:22.333
When you were a child, as long as you were unhappy

25
00:01:22.333 --> 00:01:24.233
I will keep ordering by myself

26
00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:25.833
No one can stop you

27
00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.033
I just hate not protecting you that day

28
00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:33.866
and

29
00:01:34.933 --> 00:01:36.433
If it weren't for my injury

30
00:01:37.133 --> 00:01:38.500
You wouldn't come to me, would you?

31
00:01:39.133 --> 00:01:40.400
You most likely will

32
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.166
Go to the dungeon

33
00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.066
Or Lin's Land

34
00:01:44.766 --> 00:01:46.400
So that's what you were thinking

35
00:01:47.866 --> 00:01:49.200
Even if you don't get hurt

36
00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:51.900
I will come to you too

37
00:01:54.866 --> 00:01:55.666
OK

38
00:01:56.133 --> 00:01:57.100
The medicine is over

39
00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:58.600
I'll go first then.

40
00:02:03.933 --> 00:02:04.733
senior brother
