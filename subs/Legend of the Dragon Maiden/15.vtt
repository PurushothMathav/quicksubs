00:00:00.566 --> 00:00:02.133
What robe is righteous?

2
00:00:02.133 --> 00:00:04.200
I can't imagine a five-year relationship between husband and wife

3
00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.400
It ended up like this, isn't it?

4
00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:13.000
Song Lang, put on the clothes I prepared for you

5
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.866
Ok thank you mother-in-law

6
00:00:16.133 --> 00:00:16.933
Humph

7
00:00:19.166 --> 00:00:21.733
Sister will send Lang's clothes in the future.

8
00:00:21.733 --> 00:00:23.866
I don't bother you to prevent him one stitch at a time

9
00:00:24.166 --> 00:00:26.633
After all, sending Lang refers to better

10
00:00:27.266 --> 00:00:29.866
You are an adulterer

11
00:00:31.166 --> 00:00:32.800
What are you talking about?

12
00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.266
Keep your mouth clean

13
00:00:34.366 --> 00:00:36.466
You are nothing more than a civilian

14
00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:38.633
More noble than the emperor

15
00:00:38.733 --> 00:00:40.700
No one supports you here

16
00:00:40.733 --> 00:00:43.066
What the hell is this Qi Sining doing?

17
00:00:43.066 --> 00:00:44.366
Why haven't you come yet?

18
00:00:46.533 --> 00:00:48.266
Congratulations to the General on his triumphant return

19
00:00:48.266 --> 00:00:49.600
News from His Royal Highness the Crown Prince

20
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.166
Your sister has been found.

21
00:00:51.166 --> 00:00:53.666
He is walking at the champion banquet at the moment

22
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:54.633
Follow me to the banquet hall

23
00:00:58.266 --> 00:00:59.366
Hahahaha

24
00:00:59.366 --> 00:01:00.666
Mom said it well

25
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
The gorgeous maiden family is Gong Kung Fu IV of Jin State

26
00:01:05.066 --> 00:01:06.066
Have you offended me?

27
00:01:06.066 --> 00:01:08.833
If Daji offends Yanyan

28
00:01:09.066 --> 00:01:10.533
That would be outrageous.

29
00:01:10.533 --> 00:01:12.666
I suggest you kneel down now

30
00:01:12.666 --> 00:01:14.466
Apologize to Yanyan

31
00:01:14.466 --> 00:01:18.233
Otherwise, if you want to get out of here today

32
00:01:18.333 --> 00:01:20.166
I'm afraid it will be difficult

33
00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:21.700
Song Yi

34
00:01:22.366 --> 00:01:26.633
The favor I owed you 5 years ago has been paid off

35
00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:28.666
But you want me to apologize

36
00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.866
No way. You're being stubborn.

37
00:01:33.866 --> 00:01:35.200
But I'm curious

38
00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.600
You've been crying for so many years

39
00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.000
I thought Song Lang saved you

40
00:01:42.866 --> 00:01:44.366
Hahahahaha

41
00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:45.700
What do you mean?

42
00:01:45.733 --> 00:01:49.600
The reason why I brought you back from the hospital five years ago

43
00:01:49.733 --> 00:01:52.666
It's because Lang Zhong said that my son's illness

44
00:01:52.666 --> 00:01:55.866
It is to learn medicine from the heart of a true woman

45
00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.366
So it seems

46
00:01:57.366 --> 00:02:00.066
That Langzhong didn't lie to me

47
00:02:00.066 --> 00:02:02.033
Hahahaha

48
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.300
This is all calculated by you

49
00:02:07.533 --> 00:02:09.733
I thought you guys saved my life

50
00:02:09.733 --> 00:02:10.633
Exactly.

51
00:02:11.333 --> 00:02:12.133
This matter

52
00:02:12.133 --> 00:02:15.366
You are still useless to me now

53
00:02:15.566 --> 00:02:19.266
Go away before you miss our golden hour

54
00:02:19.266 --> 00:02:20.200
Is it right?

55
00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.833
Hahahaha
