00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:05.400
rhetoric

2
00:00:06.366 --> 00:00:07.966
Can't save him

3
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:09.700
Can't save him

4
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.066
Didn't you say you would solve the address yourself?

5
00:00:20.166 --> 00:00:21.700
And the dragon girl who gets in the way

6
00:00:22.133 --> 00:00:23.833
How did you make yourself so bad?

7
00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:26.966
Something unexpected happened.

8
00:00:27.733 --> 00:00:29.033
Second princess

9
00:00:29.266 --> 00:00:31.300
I need you to do something for me.

10
00:00:32.933 --> 00:00:34.300
After the event

11
00:00:34.566 --> 00:00:36.266
The prince is you

12
00:00:41.166 --> 00:00:42.866
Master has returned to the Invisible Pavilion

13
00:00:42.866 --> 00:00:45.233
Before he left, he gave me three tips.

14
00:00:45.333 --> 00:00:48.266
Said that the location of the three magic tools was recorded on it

15
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.700
Huanggong Bichun Beads

16
00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.233
This first magic weapon is actually in the palace

17
00:00:59.466 --> 00:01:01.200
Brother, you are the prince

18
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.500
I know the palace best

19
00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:03.766
Have you heard of it?

20
00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:06.833
Princess protection, many officials are recorded

21
00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:08.900
I only told the people from the Internal Affairs Department

22
00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:10.400
Items to check and sink

23
00:01:10.566 --> 00:01:12.000
Thank you, brother.

24
00:01:12.666 --> 00:01:15.600
Little Junior Sister, why should you be polite between us?

25
00:01:17.266 --> 00:01:19.900
Anyway, it will take dozens of days to investigate Bi Chenzhu

26
00:01:19.933 --> 00:01:22.433
Why don't the little junior sister live in my prince's mansion?

27
00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.466
I have everything anyway

28
00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:25.966
Ok big brother

29
00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.200
So that's your plan.

30
00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.366
Let the little junior sister live in your prince's mansion

31
00:01:31.366 --> 00:01:34.700
Could it be that you want to get the moon first?

32
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.100
Nothing

33
00:01:36.333 --> 00:01:38.766
Little Junior Sister just needs a place to deliver

34
00:01:38.766 --> 00:01:40.200
I think about it.

35
00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.166
My Prince's Mansion is the most suitable

36
00:01:42.166 --> 00:01:43.466
That's a must, Junior Sister

37
00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.466
Prince's Mansion is a secular place

38
00:01:45.466 --> 00:01:46.566
Reiki is thin

39
00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.300
Why don't you go back to Tianyi Pavilion with the third senior brother?

40
00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:51.866
There are abundant and rare medicinal materials in it

41
00:01:51.866 --> 00:01:53.166
The most suitable for recuperating the body

42
00:01:53.166 --> 00:01:54.766
Go go

43
00:01:54.766 --> 00:01:57.000
What kind of truth is there in my womb?

44
00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.500
You must boldly run to Tianyi Pavilion

45
00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.300
Our Tianyi Pavilion also has junior sisters for everything.

46
00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:02.333
I have a junior sister to go with everything

47
00:02:02.333 --> 00:02:03.166
Come back to Tianyi Pavilion with me

48
00:02:03.166 --> 00:02:04.366
We have everything in Tianyi Pavilion.

49
00:02:04.366 --> 00:02:05.366
I have everything

50
00:02:05.366 --> 00:02:06.466
Tianyi Pavilion also has everything.

51
00:02:06.466 --> 00:02:07.400
Junior sister is ready
