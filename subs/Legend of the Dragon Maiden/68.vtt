00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:01.966
I'll give you one last chance.

2
00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:03.933
Money or not

3
00:00:03.933 --> 00:00:05.600
You rich people

4
00:00:05.933 --> 00:00:07.400
So much money difference

5
00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:09.566
So much confidence

6
00:00:09.933 --> 00:00:12.833
Why do we have to take away our only home?

7
00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:15.700
Why love

8
00:00:15.933 --> 00:00:18.266
I don't want to run out of home soon.

9
00:00:18.266 --> 00:00:19.400
material repentance

10
00:00:19.566 --> 00:00:21.700
Call me don't

11
00:00:24.866 --> 00:00:26.866
Ha ha.

12
00:00:28.966 --> 00:00:29.766
Ha ha.

13
00:00:30.066 --> 00:00:34.066
Hahahahaha

14
00:00:38.733 --> 00:00:42.266
I think this girl is quite watery

15
00:00:42.366 --> 00:00:44.100
She is innocent.

16
00:00:44.133 --> 00:00:45.866
Don't kill me!

17
00:00:47.266 --> 00:00:48.100
Grandpa

18
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.433
Money or not

19
00:00:51.066 --> 00:00:51.966
Ah money

20
00:00:53.266 --> 00:00:55.600
Ladies, I have a virtue in my mouth

21
00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.266
Money not money money

22
00:00:58.266 --> 00:01:00.600
I killed your daughter in front of you

23
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.400
Haha, do you want to sign it or not?

24
00:01:02.733 --> 00:01:04.466
Hahaha stop

25
00:01:04.733 --> 00:01:06.466
Let go of the kid and we'll sign

26
00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.166
Because his parents entrusted us with it before they left

27
00:01:18.266 --> 00:01:21.133
His parents died on the battlefield

28
00:01:21.133 --> 00:01:23.400
We can't let anything happen to him again!

29
00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.100
Is this okay?

30
00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.500
Can't you lose it sooner?

31
00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:47.666
You people have to force me to go

32
00:01:47.766 --> 00:01:49.366
I said let him go
