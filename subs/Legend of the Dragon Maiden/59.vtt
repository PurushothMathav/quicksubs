1
00:00:00.966 --> 00:00:02.000
So torn

2
00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.966
Why don't you bring both into the mansion?

3
00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:08.600
A prince and a general

4
00:00:09.133 --> 00:00:12.000
Don't hurt your husband because of the marriage

5
00:00:12.266 --> 00:00:13.366
How about this?

6
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.300
I hand over the decree of marriage to Sangning

7
00:00:16.733 --> 00:00:18.266
Who does Sunning want to control?

8
00:00:18.266 --> 00:00:20.766
Write that person's name on the decree

9
00:00:20.766 --> 00:00:22.800
How nice

10
00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:26.900
Good Majesty, please listen to Eason Chan, but it's okay to say

11
00:00:26.933 --> 00:00:28.266
It's decided today.

12
00:00:28.266 --> 00:00:30.066
The demons are eyeing the Central Plains

13
00:00:30.166 --> 00:00:31.533
Intent to maintain the world

14
00:00:31.533 --> 00:00:33.500
Before the complete annihilation of the Demon Cult

15
00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.100
Sanning has no intention of marrying

16
00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.966
Your Majesty, please grant Bichen Zhu to suppress the dutiful son and be ruthless

17
00:00:38.966 --> 00:00:40.100
marriage

18
00:00:40.133 --> 00:00:41.166
We'll discuss it later.

19
00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.700
Dragon girl really cares about the world

20
00:00:44.066 --> 00:00:46.666
Since Bichenzhu helps you

21
00:00:46.766 --> 00:00:48.000
I promise

22
00:00:48.466 --> 00:00:50.500
Give him to you

23
00:00:51.966 --> 00:00:53.233
Resurrection is impossible

24
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.966
The Dragon Temple is no longer the Dragon God of the past

25
00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.466
When you set out to rebel

26
00:00:59.466 --> 00:01:01.100
You can't give him the victory bead.

27
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.166
Hell, it's a felony for me to exterminate the dragon girl

28
00:01:05.133 --> 00:01:06.166
These Women

29
00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:09.266
The people of the Fire Dynasty are oppressed by the Dragon God Sword Soldiers

30
00:01:09.333 --> 00:01:10.300
People are struggling

31
00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:11.400
On the other hand, Dragon Girl

32
00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.900
Nothing happened for five years

33
00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.500
And you let your subordinates do what they want?

34
00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.200
It's not a rebellion. What is it?

35
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.100
Second son, what evidence do you have?

36
00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:19.900
If you were to spill blood

37
00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:21.400
No, please.

38
00:01:22.166 --> 00:01:24.400
The person who came was brought by the crowd

39
00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.466
Emperor Long Chen oppresses the people

40
00:01:31.733 --> 00:01:32.633
Tom is in the beam

41
00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.266
Do you want to decide for us?
