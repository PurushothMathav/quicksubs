1
00:00:06.066 --> 00:00:09.400
This second magic weapon is actually waving just right

2
00:00:09.766 --> 00:00:12.900
Let's see who won the name of the Dragon Temple

3
00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.166
Harm the people

4
00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:18.766
The police record that you are born with luck

5
00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.200
This journey is built by the imperial court

6
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:22.866
To support veterans

7
00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.466
Why is the door closed in the clear sky and daylight?

8
00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:29.100
Anybody?

9
00:00:31.066 --> 00:00:31.866
Over the wall

10
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:34.600
Who?

11
00:00:35.966 --> 00:00:37.500
Uh-huh.

12
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.133
We are the people of the Dragon Temple

13
00:00:39.133 --> 00:00:40.700
To visit veterans

14
00:00:40.733 --> 00:00:42.600
I don't know about you

15
00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:45.333
How is the Dragon Temple organized?

16
00:00:45.333 --> 00:00:46.666
And face over

17
00:00:48.133 --> 00:00:49.333
We come to worship you kindly

18
00:00:49.333 --> 00:00:50.466
Why are you talking so bad?

19
00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:50.900
What a coincidence.

20
00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:51.766
Who doesn't know?

21
00:00:51.766 --> 00:00:55.200
Our rural betting dog is not strict, dear Nan Ba Yu

22
00:00:55.366 --> 00:00:56.366
All evil

23
00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.033
It's definitely not kind to say he came to let it go

24
00:01:00.333 --> 00:01:01.966
If you have the heart

25
00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.566
Just go to the ancestral hall of Qiaocheng to have a look.

26
00:01:04.566 --> 00:01:06.833
Let's see how ungrateful they are

27
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.433
Let's go to the ancestral hall

28
00:01:11.666 --> 00:01:13.833
You old, sick and disabled veterans

29
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.066
Living is a waste of food

30
00:01:16.066 --> 00:01:17.600
Still occupy such a good place

31
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.500
Why don't you just throw it all into the mass grave and die for yourself?
