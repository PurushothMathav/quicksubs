1
00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:00.966
Yeah.

2
00:00:01.333 --> 00:00:02.166
Stop

3
00:00:06.366 --> 00:00:07.600
broad daylight

4
00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:08.833
bully

5
00:00:09.066 --> 00:00:10.300
Challenge the ancestral home of the martyrs

6
00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:11.700
Do you still have the law in your eyes?

7
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:12.833
Where did the untouchables come from?

8
00:00:12.966 --> 00:00:13.866
Mind your own business

9
00:00:13.866 --> 00:00:16.433
Do you know who I am, General Qi?

10
00:00:17.666 --> 00:00:19.300
General Qiqi

11
00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.500
You are General Qi Siming of Zhenguo

12
00:00:22.666 --> 00:00:25.300
Who gave you the courage to dare to touch my Qi family army?

13
00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.833
General Qi and the others have been retired from the army for many years

14
00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.533
He is no longer a member of the Qi Army

15
00:00:29.533 --> 00:00:31.800
They are now standing around

16
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:32.900
Useless

17
00:00:32.966 --> 00:00:36.066
I'm also cleaning up and smashing for the court

18
00:00:37.333 --> 00:00:38.400
Again.

19
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.766
General Qi, you can't touch me

20
00:00:40.766 --> 00:00:42.500
I am the captain of Qiaocheng

21
00:00:42.533 --> 00:00:46.000
Above me is the Dragon God Temple, Lord Dogu

22
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.300
If you dare to move, I will oppose the Dragon Temple

23
00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.033
The Dragon Temple has people like you

24
00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.200
Xuanying really belongs to the boldness of general education

25
00:00:54.566 --> 00:00:57.000
Xuanying is the first god of war under the seat of Dragoness

26
00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.066
Even the governor is afraid to call him by his first name

27
00:00:59.133 --> 00:01:00.600
What are you?

28
00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.366
Dare to offend the god of war
