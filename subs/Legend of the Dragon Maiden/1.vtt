Imperial court Yuan Buddhist leader Jin Wuqi

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.200
Captured five people from Jinling Sect

3
00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:09.100
Only to win the four financial items of Jinling Sect

4
00:00:09.333 --> 00:00:12.033
Cultivate the Great Merit of the World

5
00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.000
Old thing, your people are dead

6
00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.866
Say where is what I want

7
00:00:34.466 --> 00:00:38.033
Both ruthless and now make the takeoff pool angry

8
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:39.600
You have a bad heart

9
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.600
Countless ways to kill in a lifetime

10
00:00:41.766 --> 00:00:46.066
Even if you get Daojin, you can't be a real dragon

11
00:00:48.866 --> 00:00:51.066
I don't love you

12
00:00:55.733 --> 00:00:58.733
The leader found the hottest residents in the northwest

13
00:00:58.733 --> 00:01:00.000
The purpose of four years

14
00:01:00.133 --> 00:01:04.466
The elves should chase after them

15
00:01:12.133 --> 00:01:13.666
My senior brother

16
00:01:14.766 --> 00:01:17.666
Junior sister, I can't run with my hands

17
00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:22.266
So boring, you and the two senior brothers go first

18
00:01:22.866 --> 00:01:24.366
After finding the genie

19
00:01:24.366 --> 00:01:27.066
Not a single remnant of the elves remains

20
00:01:27.166 --> 00:01:28.800
They were injured

21
00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:29.800
Can't run very far

22
00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:30.933
Search for me no

23
00:01:30.933 --> 00:01:33.433
I can't offend senior brother, let's go

24
00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.433
Junior sister listens to what the master says

25
00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.200
You have to work hard.

26
00:01:46.266 --> 00:01:48.966
Brother, you must protect the elves

27
00:01:49.066 --> 00:01:51.966
Then I will find you with this.

28
00:01:51.966 --> 00:01:54.000
What are you going to do?

29
00:01:54.466 --> 00:01:56.233
I'll distract them

30
00:01:59.333 --> 00:02:01.400
Brother take care

31
00:02:02.533 --> 00:02:05.233
Junior Sister Junior Sister

32
00:02:06.366 --> 00:02:08.566
I'm here, over there.

33
00:02:09.333 --> 00:02:10.133
that

34
00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:17.966
Little sister, why are you alone?

35
00:02:18.166 --> 00:02:19.700
What about the other cubs?

36
00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.000
You'll never find them.

37
00:02:22.766 --> 00:02:23.566
Humph

38
00:02:23.866 --> 00:02:26.800
Don't say call me

39
00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.600
I can't let my sister's beauty fall

40
00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.800
Little things carry it for me

41
00:02:34.366 --> 00:02:35.266
OK
