00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:01.833
No bones left

2
00:00:03.866 --> 00:00:05.333
Sister, you can't go

3
00:00:05.333 --> 00:00:06.300
You can't draw your sword

4
00:00:06.366 --> 00:00:08.700
Don't worry, he is the dragon girl.

5
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.166
Nothing will happen to him if he draws his sword

6
00:00:11.266 --> 00:00:13.966
And only the dragon girl can pull out the jade dragon sword

7
00:00:14.166 --> 00:00:15.466
What if you got the wrong person?

8
00:00:15.466 --> 00:00:16.266
Yes, Junior Sister

9
00:00:16.266 --> 00:00:17.300
You can't draw your sword

10
00:00:17.333 --> 00:00:18.900
We can't let you go on an adventure.

11
00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:20.066
Two senior brothers

12
00:00:20.133 --> 00:00:21.333
Say no more.

13
00:00:21.333 --> 00:00:22.400
As you wish

14
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.066
Only by drawing a sword can we save you

15
00:00:24.066 --> 00:00:26.300
Whether I am the dragon girl or not

16
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.066
I must marry

17
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.700
Since you can't make a decision

18
00:00:30.966 --> 00:00:33.233
Then I'll make this decision for you

19
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.000
Yeah.

20
00:00:42.066 --> 00:00:44.566
Somebody take it for me

21
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.466
What do you want?

22
00:00:51.566 --> 00:00:53.666
I'm going to give you two options.

23
00:00:54.133 --> 00:00:56.233
The first to draw the sword

24
00:00:56.266 --> 00:00:57.366
In that case

25
00:00:57.366 --> 00:00:59.400
I can spare a few of them today.

26
00:00:59.533 --> 00:01:02.866
Second, you can leave without drawing your sword

27
00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:06.700
But they all have to die today

28
00:01:07.166 --> 00:01:09.533
How do you choose?

29
00:01:09.533 --> 00:01:12.166
Little Junior Sister, don't worry, let's go

30
00:01:12.166 --> 00:01:13.800
Little sister, hurry up

31
00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.666
You saved three of our senior brothers back then

32
00:01:15.666 --> 00:01:18.200
Now it's our turn to protect you

33
00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.166
Go away, little sister

34
00:01:20.566 --> 00:01:21.933
Your life is more important than anything else

35
00:01:21.933 --> 00:01:24.433
Stop talking nonsense, I don't have that much patience

36
00:01:24.466 --> 00:01:26.300
Are you dead or are they dead?
