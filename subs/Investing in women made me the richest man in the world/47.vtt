00:00:01.766 --> 00:00:03.533
Hey, I'm panicking

2
00:00:03.533 --> 00:00:05.800
It was me who broke up

3
00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:06.866
Excuse me

4
00:00:06.866 --> 00:00:08.466
It's not convenient for me to take a job now

5
00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:12.366
Huang Xiang, this old fool, actually hung up on me.

6
00:00:12.366 --> 00:00:13.233
Call Lao Zhao

7
00:00:13.566 --> 00:00:16.266
This is still 30 years of friendship.

8
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.366
Lao Zhao is my Wang Fan

9
00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.200
What exactly did you do?

10
00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.500
He suddenly called the whole family to a meeting

11
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:26.966
Hey, okay, move forward

12
00:00:26.966 --> 00:00:28.066
I'll turn off my phone right now

13
00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.666
What happened to dad?

14
00:00:36.466 --> 00:00:38.133
He teamed up with Xia Xue

15
00:00:38.133 --> 00:00:40.133
Ruled away all the families in Jiangcheng

16
00:00:40.133 --> 00:00:42.000
What is DeDaoDuoZhu?

17
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.233
Unjust and unhelpful

18
00:00:43.266 --> 00:00:44.800
Very simple reason

19
00:00:46.466 --> 00:00:49.866
Today is the end of your Fan family

20
00:00:49.866 --> 00:00:51.766
Hum you fart

21
00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.500
So what if we lose that group of trash?

22
00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:56.300
Anyway

23
00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.966
They will just follow our Fan family

24
00:00:58.966 --> 00:00:59.966
dog person

25
00:00:59.966 --> 00:01:02.300
With the assets of our Fan family,

26
00:01:02.333 --> 00:01:04.600
Sooner or later it will come back

27
00:01:05.366 --> 00:01:07.466
The bottom line of Asset Wanjia

28
00:01:08.066 --> 00:01:10.566
It's not something that a nouveau riche like you can avoid.

29
00:01:10.566 --> 00:01:12.666
I want to cut you into a magic stick

30
00:01:13.066 --> 00:01:15.566
Uh, I'll talk to you again

31
00:01:15.566 --> 00:01:18.400
All the women who have connections go to the brothels

32
00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.533
I want you to watch helplessly

33
00:01:20.533 --> 00:01:23.066
They screamed under other men's crotches

34
00:01:23.066 --> 00:01:25.300
Hahaha, when the time comes

35
00:01:25.666 --> 00:01:30.966
I'll break your bones inch by inch

36
00:01:30.966 --> 00:01:33.266
Good, what a pity, reflection

37
00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.900
You have no chance to do it again

38
00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.366
What can Moon Shadow be?

39
00:00:01.766 --> 00:00:03.533
Hey, I am panicking.

40
00:00:03.533 --> 00:00:05.800
I broke up

41
00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:06.866
Excuse me.

42
00:00:06.866 --> 00:00:08.466
I can't take a job right now

43
00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:12.366
Huang Xiang, this old Hu who died, actually hung up on me

44
00:00:12.366 --> 00:00:13.233
Call Lao Zhao

45
00:00:13.566 --> 00:00:16.266
There's still 30 years of friendship

46
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.366
Lao Zhao is my Wang Fan

47
00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.200
What did you do?

48
00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.500
suddenly called a whole family meeting

49
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:26.966
Hey ok go ahead

50
00:00:26.966 --> 00:00:28.066
I will turn it off now.

51
00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.666
Dad, what is wrong?

52
00:00:36.466 --> 00:00:38.133
He teamed up with Snow

53
00:00:38.133 --> 00:00:40.133
Took away all the families in Jiangcheng

54
00:00:40.133 --> 00:00:42.000
What to get more help

55
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.233
Misguided

56
00:00:43.266 --> 00:00:44.800
That is pretty simple.

57
00:00:46.466 --> 00:00:49.866
Today is the end of your Fan family

58
00:00:49.866 --> 00:00:51.766
Hmph you fart

59
00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.500
What would happen without that bunch of trash?

60
00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:56.300
Anyway

61
00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.966
They will just follow behind our Fan family

62
00:00:58.966 --> 00:00:59.966
People who are dogs

63
00:00:59.966 --> 00:01:02.300
With the assets of our Fan family

64
00:01:02.333 --> 00:01:04.600
Sooner or later it will make a comeback

65
00:01:05.366 --> 00:01:07.466
The bottom view of Wanjia Asset

66
00:01:08.066 --> 00:01:10.566
It is not something an upstart like you can avoid

67
00:01:10.566 --> 00:01:12.666
I am going to make you into a wizard

68
00:01:13.066 --> 00:01:15.566
Uh, with you again

69
00:01:15.566 --> 00:01:18.400
All the women in relationships go into the kiln

70
00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.533
I want you to watch

71
00:01:20.533 --> 00:01:23.066
They screamed under other men's crotches

72
00:01:23.066 --> 00:01:25.300
Hahaha, when the time comes

73
00:01:25.666 --> 00:01:30.966
I will break your bones inch by inch

74
00:01:30.966 --> 00:01:33.266
Okay, what a pity, reflection.

75
00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.900
You do not have a chance to do it again

76
00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.366
What can the moon shadow be?
