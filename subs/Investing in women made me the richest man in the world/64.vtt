1 million

2
00:00:02.933 --> 00:00:05.000
Li Yao, you are teasing me, please calm down.

3
00:00:05.966 --> 00:00:06.833
That's it

4
00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:08.600
I spend money directly

5
00:00:08.666 --> 00:00:09.866
Still lavish

6
00:00:10.333 --> 00:00:12.900
Xiaoqing set a limit for my transaction

7
00:00:12.966 --> 00:00:14.466
I can only figure it out bit by bit at a time.

8
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:15.300
But don't worry

9
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:16.866
I will definitely give it all to you

10
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:19.333
Or you go to the bank with me

11
00:00:19.333 --> 00:00:20.533
I'll forward it to you directly

12
00:00:20.533 --> 00:00:21.733
Do you think I'm a fool?

13
00:00:21.733 --> 00:00:24.600
Ah, I won’t believe you. It’s up to you to see for yourself.

14
00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:44.866
kill you

15
00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.366
You dare to hinder me

16
00:00:53.366 --> 00:00:54.766
I'll kill you

17
00:00:57.933 --> 00:00:58.766
stop

18
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.600
I'm here to see who dares to take action

19
00:01:08.566 --> 00:01:09.566
Ah, what are you doing?

20
00:01:09.566 --> 00:01:12.833
What would you do if you didn't see it with your own eyes?

21
00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:13.866
I can't believe it

22
00:01:13.866 --> 00:01:16.000
There are such extremely kind people in the world

23
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.866
You hurt your sister

24
00:01:17.966 --> 00:01:20.500
Misappropriating mother's medical expenses and spending a lot of money

25
00:01:20.566 --> 00:01:21.833
What's your crime?

26
00:01:23.066 --> 00:01:24.600
Mr. Chen, I was wrong

27
00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.800
I was wrong. Please forgive me this time.

28
00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.000
Xu XinXu Xin

29
00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:30.500
I'm your brother

30
00:01:30.766 --> 00:01:32.866
You, please talk to me, Xu Xin

31

I'm talking to you

32
00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.600
Give me the hard-earned medical expenses for my mother

33
00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.333
When used to raise women

34
00:01:41.333 --> 00:01:43.266
Why don't you remember that you are my brother?

35
00:01:43.533 --> 00:01:46.266
When you want to sell me for money to collect the dowry

36
00:01:46.266 --> 00:01:48.200
Why don't you remember that you are my brother?

37
00:01:51.533 --> 00:01:52.433
Xia Chengzhuo

38
00:01:53.133 --> 00:01:54.866
I have committed a great evil calamity

39
00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:56.266
please

40
00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.266
starting from

41
00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:01.400
Throw it to the bitter kiln in Beijing

42
00:02:01.566 --> 00:02:02.600
He will be for life

43
00:02:02.966 --> 00:02:03.800
take away

44
00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.366
Let go of my grandson

45
00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:09.866
Xiaoqi Linyao

46
00:02:13.066 --> 00:02:15.633
Okay, don’t cry anymore

47
00:02:15.666 --> 00:02:16.700
It's okay

48
00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.200
Isn't this good for me?

49
00:02:18.533 --> 00:02:19.333
fine

50
00:02:19.966 --> 00:02:22.666
Our days are still long in the future

51
00:02:24.066 --> 00:02:25.933
Where is Mr. Lin this time?

52
00:02:25.933 --> 00:02:28.900
I have something else to ask you. Do you mind not talking?

53
00:02:30.166 --> 00:02:31.033
good

54
00:00:00.533 --> 00:00:02.066
1 million

55
00:00:02.933 --> 00:00:05.000
Li Yao, you are kidding me, calm down

56
00:00:05.966 --> 00:00:06.833
It is the following.

57
00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:08.600
I pay directly

58
00:00:08.666 --> 00:00:09.866
Also lavish

59
00:00:10.333 --> 00:00:12.900
Xiaoqing has set a limit on my transactions

60
00:00:12.966 --> 00:00:14.466
Just a little bit at a time

61
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:15.300
But do not worry.

62
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:16.866
I will give it all to you.

63
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:19.333
Or you go to the bank with me

64
00:00:19.333 --> 00:00:20.533
I will transfer it to you directly.

65
00:00:20.533 --> 00:00:21.733
Do you take me for a fool?

66
00:00:21.733 --> 00:00:24.600
Ah, I will not believe you. See for yourself.

67
00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:44.866
Kill you

68
00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.366
How dare you hinder me

69
00:00:53.366 --> 00:00:54.766
I will kill you.

70
00:00:57.933 --> 00:00:58.766
Stop

71
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.600
With me, I will see who dares to do it

72
00:01:08.566 --> 00:01:09.566
Ah what are you doing

73
00:01:09.566 --> 00:01:12.833
What if I didn't see it with my own eyes

74
00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:13.866
I can't believe it.

75
00:01:13.866 --> 00:01:16.000
There are such wonders in the world

76
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.866
You hurt your sister

77
00:01:17.966 --> 00:01:20.500
Embezzlement of mother's medical expenses

78
00:01:20.566 --> 00:01:21.833
What is your crime?

79
00:01:23.066 --> 00:01:24.600
Mr. Chen, I was wrong.

80
00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.800
I was wrong, please forgive me this time.

81
00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.000
Xu Xin Xu Xin

82
00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:30.500
I am your brother

83
00:01:30.766 --> 00:01:32.866
You, talk to me, Xu Xin

84
00:01:33.933 --> 00:01:35.633
I am talking to you

85
00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.600
You gave me the hard-earned medical bills for our mother

86
00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.333
When you take it to raise a woman

87
00:01:41.333 --> 00:01:43.266
Why do not you remember that you are my brother?

88
00:01:43.533 --> 00:01:46.266
When you are going to sell me for money

89
00:01:46.266 --> 00:01:48.200
Why do not you remember that you are my brother?

90
00:01:51.533 --> 00:01:52.433
Xia Chengzhuo

91
00:01:53.133 --> 00:01:54.866
I cut the sin of great evil

92
00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:56.266
Please.

93
00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.266
Start from the middle

94
00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:01.400
Throw it to Beijing Bitter Kiln

95
00:02:01.566 --> 00:02:02.600
He will be forever

96
00:02:02.966 --> 00:02:03.800
Take away

97
00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.366
Let go of my old grandson

98
00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:09.866
Xiaoqi Linyao

99
00:02:13.066 --> 00:02:15.633
Ok stop crying

100
00:02:15.666 --> 00:02:16.700
Is everything okay?

101
00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.200
Am I fine?

102
00:02:18.533 --> 00:02:19.333
Yeah.

103
00:02:19.966 --> 00:02:22.666
We have a long way to go.

104
00:02:24.066 --> 00:02:25.933
What about Mr. Lin this time?

105
00:02:25.933 --> 00:02:28.900
I have one more thing for you, would you mind not talking?

106
00:02:30.166 --> 00:02:31.033
OK
