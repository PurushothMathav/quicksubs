Brother received the message

2
00:00:04.266 --> 00:00:06.100
Jiang Yao appeared in this elementary school

3
00:00:06.366 --> 00:00:10.066
Why did he appear here?

4
00:00:10.166 --> 00:00:12.633
I'm sure he came with bad intentions.

5
00:00:13.166 --> 00:00:14.866
Save me Lin Yao

6
00:00:16.533 --> 00:00:19.566
Jiang Yao, how could you do this?

7
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:23.866
We were right before

8
00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:26.566
You can punish me however you want

9
00:00:26.733 --> 00:00:28.800
But I beg you to help me

10
00:00:28.866 --> 00:00:30.966
You are my last hope

11
00:00:31.566 --> 00:00:32.633
Don't kneel

12
00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:33.500
get up and talk

13
00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:34.466
I can't get up

14
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.166
If you don't come

15
00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:37.500
I won't get up

16
00:00:37.933 --> 00:00:39.833
If you want to speak, speak well

17
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.200
I like kneeling so much

18
00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:42.200
Kneel outside

19
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.066
Don't mess up my yard

20
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:45.500
I

21
00:00:45.666 --> 00:00:47.300
I get up, I get up

22
00:00:49.166 --> 00:00:52.100
What happened to Xiaoyao?

23
00:00:53.966 --> 00:00:55.500
Save me, save me
