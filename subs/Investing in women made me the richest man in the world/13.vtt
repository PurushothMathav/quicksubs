00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.039
support

2
00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:02.719
This is the first time anyone has used it

3
00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:03.719
Such obscene words

4
00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:04.199
tease me

5
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:05.519
Mr. Fan

6
00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:06.119
I can be a little bit

7
00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:07.519
It doesn't mean anything obscene.

8
00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:08.319
Think about it

9
00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:10.719
you look so beautiful

10
00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:11.719
Good figure

11
00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:12.799
Not being taken care of

12
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.399
Isn't it such a pity?

13
00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:15.479
And me

14
00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:16.519
There's plenty of money

15
00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:17.319
follow me

16
00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:17.919
you can do

17
00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:19.159
anything you want to do

18
00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:20.199
I have absolutely no restrictions

19
00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:20.919
your freedom

20
00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:22.719
We each take what we need

21
00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:23.279
He Le

22
00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:24.519
Not for that

23
00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:25.879
pity

24
00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:27.439
what are you talking about

25
00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:29.999
You know in Jiangcheng

26
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.679
How many young talents are there?

27
00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:32.879
and the top rich young man

28
00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.239
They are queuing up to marry me

29
00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:35.199
I can't get anything I ask for

30
00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:36.999
Why do you say that to me?

31
00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:38.599
Mr. Fan

32
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:39.519
you need to know

33
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.159
They don't get what they ask for

34
00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.159
It's their business

35
00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:43.759
I want to take care of you

36
00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:44.919
that's my thing

37
00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:45.479
you

38
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.039
Mr. Lin

39
00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.079
You do have some strength

40
00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.279
You can pay a premium of two square meters

41
00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:55.879
Buy Fan’s KTV

42
00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:57.879
But in Jiangcheng

43
00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:59.039
It requires connections

44
00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:00.039
and resources

45
00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:02.479
As long as you are willing to follow me

46
00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:04.959
Fan’s connections and resources

47
00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:06.359
It's all yours

48
00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:07.559
otherwise

49
00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:09.959
Let you be ruined

50
00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:12.159
oh

51
00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.799
ruined

52
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.479
Then I'd really like to know

53
00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:20.279
Mr. Fan, how could you let me

54
00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.599
Disgraced

55
00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:25.119
Mysterious rich man

56
00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:26.479
and beautiful CEO

57
00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:27.759
In the car on the street

58
00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:28.799
occult movement

59
00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:30.079
you say

60
00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:31.679
Will it make headlines?

61
00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.839
Will you let your whole family

62
00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.079
ruined

63
00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.119
What Mr. Fan said

64
00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:38.279
occult movement

65
00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.439
Does it mean

66
00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:41.599
?

67
00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.999
That

68
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.559
I quite wanted to

69
00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.119
I’m afraid of you, Mr. Fan

70
00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:49.999
Don't dare

71
00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:52.759
Mr. Lin

72
00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:54.239
Don't go too far

73
00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:55.719
My friend is also Jiangcheng

74
00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:56.879
The most beautiful CEO

75
00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:59.319
Don’t I want to lose face?

76
00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:00.039
Mr. Fan

77
00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:01.319
you sometimes

78
00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.519
Quite cute too

79
00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:03.599
but

80
00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:04.479
It was you who took the initiative

81
00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:05.879
proposed a mysterious movement

82
00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:06.639
to seduce me

83
00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:07.599
I agreed

84
00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:08.999
You don't agree

85
00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:10.959
In this case

86
00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:12.719
I feel bad too

87
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.639
I'm here

88
00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:14.999
I'm talking to you about business

89
00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:16.639
you say

90
00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:17.799
What's serious

91
00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.719
What are you doing?

92
00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:19.999
would you like to marry me

93
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.199
I don't want to marry you

94
00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:22.519
But I can take care of you

95
00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.199
Or in the car with you

96
00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:25.879
occult movement

97
00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:27.719
Why do you say that to me?

98
00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:28.799
At once

99
00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:30.999
Just because I have money

100
00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:32.039
Mr. Fan

101
00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.839
Yes or no

102
00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:34.439
As long as I prove I have money

103
00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:35.199
you are willing

104
00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.399
Let me take care of you

105
00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:38.479
good

106
00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:40.319
Then how do you want to support me?

107
00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.559
You are a beautiful CEO

108
00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:43.999
and

109
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.919
The legs are still so long

110
00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:46.919
or

111
00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.959
One hundred million

112
00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:48.559
How many

113
00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:50.679
Two hundred million

114
00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:53.359
500 million
