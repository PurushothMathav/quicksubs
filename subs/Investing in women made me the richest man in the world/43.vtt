00:00:01.566 --> 00:00:03.100
Let you all be my little brothers

3
00:00:05.466 --> 00:00:06.200
What did you say

4
00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:08.866
I mean you guys are from the casino, right?

5
00:00:08.866 --> 00:00:11.500
I bought this casino

6
00:00:12.266 --> 00:00:13.966
Hahahahahaha

7
00:00:14.166 --> 00:00:17.633
Are you thinking shit in your poor ass?

8
00:00:17.933 --> 00:00:19.533
This is the trump card for selling

9
00:00:19.533 --> 00:00:20.766
A casino worth 300 million

10
00:00:20.766 --> 00:00:21.833
What did you buy?

11
00:00:21.966 --> 00:00:24.866
300 million, I donâ€™t have that much money in my hand

12
00:00:25.333 --> 00:00:26.800
I can think of a way

13
00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.900
How to show women how to consume

14
00:00:30.966 --> 00:00:33.833
I'll make a bet with him

15
00:00:35.066 --> 00:00:38.266
You mean the money you want to win at this casino

16
00:00:38.266 --> 00:00:39.966
Buy this casino

17
00:00:39.966 --> 00:00:41.666
Right

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.833
Hahaha, then you have thought about it.

19
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.300
This person has been selling medicine for 10 years without any problems

20
00:00:57.566 --> 00:01:00.466
If you lose, you can't get the money back

21
00:01:00.466 --> 00:01:02.600
I will make your life worse than death

22
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.166
Okay, nonsense

23
00:01:04.266 --> 00:01:06.033

Pardon me?

27
00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:08.866

28
00:00:08.866 --> 00:00:11.500
I bought this casino

29
00:00:12.266 --> 00:00:13.966

00:00:19.533 --> 00:00:20.766
A $300 million casino

33
00:00:20.766 --> 00:00:21.833
What do you get?

34
00:00:21.966 --> 00:00:24.866
300 million, I do not have that much money in my hands

35
00:00:25.333 --> 00:00:26.800
I can think of a way.

36
00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.900
How can I show women how to spend?

37
00:00:30.966 --> 00:00:33.833
Yes, I will take a gamble with him.

38
00:00:35.066 --> 00:00:38.266

00:00:39.966 --> 00:00:41.666
Yeah, I am.

41
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.833
Hahaha, have you thought about it?

42
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.300
This one has been on the drug for 10 years without failure

43
00:00:57.566 --> 00:01:00.466
You do not have money if you lose

44
00:01:00.466 --> 00:01:02.600
I will make your life worse than death

45
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.166
All right, crap.
