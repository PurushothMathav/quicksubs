﻿1
00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:04.560
I'll take care of you

2
00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:07.120
Keep me

3
00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:08.400
Been in business for so many years

4
00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:09.680
I've seen countless

5
00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:10.320
The person who gave me a red envelope

6
00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:11.920
first time heard

7
00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:12.560
Some people say they want to support me

8
00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:14.480
you really are

9
00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:15.440
opened my eyes

10
00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:17.040
Say it

11
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.000
How much

12
00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:19.280
As a doctor?

13
00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:20.240
I still have

14
00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:20.560
professional ethics

15
00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:22.160
money to me

16
00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:22.800
unimportant

17
00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:24.080
but

18
00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:24.720
Our company

19
00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:25.360
Recently I am developing a batch of

20
00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:26.320
new equipment

21
00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:26.960
Need 20,000

22
00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.240
if you could

23
00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:28.880
Take these 20 million

24
00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:29.520
Completed

25
00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:30.480
I

26
00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:31.440
I agree to let you take care of me

27
00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.040
Then try it

28
00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:34.960
Give me your company account

29
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:43.600
It’s a deal

30
00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:44.880
Don't regret it

31
00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.360
What

32
00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:50.960
Twenty million

33
00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.280
Completed in one go

34
00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:57.360
Isn't it good here?

35
00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:58.640
If someone sees it

36
00:00:58.920 --> 00:00:59.920
That

37
00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:01.800
We'll go to your office

38
00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.200
I am worried

39
00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:09.840
Full of anger

40
00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:10.480
No place to vent

41
00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:11.760
That

42
00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:12.720
It's up to you
