00:00:00.466 --> 00:00:02.033
You talk shamelessly

2
00:00:02.166 --> 00:00:03.966
Okay, let's go get the computer.

3
00:00:30.766 --> 00:00:32.866
Jiang Cheng’s stock market collapsed completely

4
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.400
A total collapse situation looks quite serious.

5
00:00:37.166 --> 00:00:38.933
To solve this problem

6
00:00:38.933 --> 00:00:40.266
There is a way

7
00:00:40.266 --> 00:00:42.966
That is to inject a large amount of diarrhea at the same time

8
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.900
Let the people of Jiang Cheng regain their confidence in

9
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:47.933
Make them willing to buy our stock

10
00:00:47.933 --> 00:00:50.900
In this way, it can be completely and completely

11
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.900
Perfect solution to this economic crisis

12
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.600
Look at my serious nonsense

13
00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.100
Haha, pretending

14
00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:01.966
Then you can solve it.

15
00:01:01.966 --> 00:01:04.600
Little girl, don’t forget

16
00:01:06.133 --> 00:01:07.666
Who has been silent with you?

17
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:09.666
Not good

18
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.733
Companies in Western countries suddenly significantly improved their national

19
00:01:12.733 --> 00:01:14.466
Now it’s 8 billion

20
00:01:17.166 --> 00:01:18.166
are you okay

21
00:01:18.166 --> 00:01:20.866
My uncle don't believe him

22
00:01:20.866 --> 00:01:22.233
He definitely can't

23
00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:23.200
little girl

24
00:01:24.166 --> 00:01:24.966
Don't you know?

25
00:01:24.966 --> 00:01:27.966
Don't just say that men are bad?

26
00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.700
Xue Xue, a queen-like beauty

27
00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.200
But unique

28
00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:33.866
can't taste taste

29
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.833
what a pity

30
00:01:35.933 --> 00:01:38.566
But the system only gave me 10 billion

31
00:01:38.566 --> 00:01:39.666
I spent it just right

32
00:01:39.666 --> 00:01:40.800
The remaining 80 years

33
00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.600
Do you want to spend it all here?

34
00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.400
If you can't pretend anymore, leave quickly

35
00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:46.833
Don't waste our time

36
00:01:47.733 --> 00:01:48.500
never mind

37
00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.566
Anyway, money is just a number if it is too much to a certain extent.

38
00:01:51.933 --> 00:01:54.300
Play around with different women who want to be Neptune

39
00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:55.333
This is more important than anything else

40
00:01:55.333 --> 00:01:57.966
Congratulations on spending all 10 billion

41
00:01:57.966 --> 00:02:00.600
The system automatically replenishes 100 billion for you

42
00:00:00.466 --> 00:00:02.033
You are shameless

43
00:00:02.166 --> 00:00:03.966
Okay, let's get the computer

44
00:00:30.766 --> 00:00:32.866
Jiangcheng's stock market crashed completely

45
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.400
The total collapse scenario looks rather severe

46
00:00:37.166 --> 00:00:38.933
To solve this problem

47
00:00:38.933 --> 00:00:40.266
There is a way

48
00:00:40.266 --> 00:00:42.966
And that is a massive injection of diarrhea at the same time.

49
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.900
Let the people of Jiangcheng regain their confidence

50
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:47.933
Make them willing to buy our stock

51
00:00:47.933 --> 00:00:50.900
This can be completely and completely

52
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.900
A perfect solution to this economic crisis

53
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.600
Look at my serious nonsense

54
00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.100
Haha pretend

55
00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:01.966
Then you can solve it. Hey.

56
00:01:01.966 --> 00:01:04.600
Little girl, do not forget

57
00:01:06.133 --> 00:01:07.666
Who is silent with you?

58
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:09.666
This is not good.

59
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.733
Western companies have suddenly and significantly promoted their country

60
00:01:12.733 --> 00:01:14.466
It is now eight billion.

61
00:01:17.166 --> 00:01:18.166
Are you okay?

62
00:01:18.166 --> 00:01:20.866
My uncle! Do not trust him!

63
00:01:20.866 --> 00:01:22.233
He certainly can't

64
00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:23.200
little girl

65
00:01:24.166 --> 00:01:24.966
Don't you know

66
00:01:24.966 --> 00:01:27.966
Do not say men can't do it casually

67
00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.700
Snow is a beautiful woman of queen temperament

68
00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.200
But unique

69
00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:33.866
Can't taste taste

70
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.833
What a pity!

71
00:01:35.933 --> 00:01:38.566
But the system only gave me 10 billion

72
00:01:38.566 --> 00:01:39.666
I spent just right

73
00:01:39.666 --> 00:01:40.800
The remaining 80 years

74
00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.600
Is it all going to be spent here?

75
00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.400
If you can't hold it anymore, just leave

76
00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:46.833
Do not waste our time.

77
00:01:47.733 --> 00:01:48.500
Never mind.

78
00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.566
Anyway, money is just a number to a certain extent

79
00:01:51.933 --> 00:01:54.300
Play with different women to be the king of the sea

80
00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:55.333
It is more important than anything

81
00:01:55.333 --> 00:01:57.966
Congratulations, you will consume 10 billion

82
00:01:57.966 --> 00:02:00.600
The system will automatically replenish 100 billion for you.
