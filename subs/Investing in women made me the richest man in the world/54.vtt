00:00:00.666 --> 00:00:01.833
Mr. Zhang is not well

2
00:00:05.666 --> 00:00:07.266
misunderstanding misunderstanding

3
00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:09.266
If you have anything to say, tell me immediately

4
00:00:09.266 --> 00:00:11.633
Other foreign financial groups continue to raise their stock prices

5
00:00:11.666 --> 00:00:13.066
the amount we need

6
00:00:13.066 --> 00:00:15.633
I'm afraid it's estimated to be around 5 billion.

7
00:00:16.066 --> 00:00:18.200
We add together the businesses

8
00:00:18.366 --> 00:00:20.366
I'm afraid I can't afford so much money.

9
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.266
so what you mean is

10
00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.166
I'm afraid we have to let foreign companies take over.

11
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:26.700
Really unwilling

12
00:00:26.733 --> 00:00:28.033
Jiangcheng unexpectedly

13
00:00:29.266 --> 00:00:31.000
Now you don't have to worry

14
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.500
Because I invited a mysterious rich man

15
00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.933
He can solve all our problems

16
00:00:36.933 --> 00:00:38.866
Are you saying

17
00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:40.633
That's right

18
00:00:41.666 --> 00:00:45.266
He doesn't look like a mysterious rich man.

19
00:00:45.466 --> 00:00:47.000
Look at how he's dressed

20
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.700
The whole body is probably added up.

21
00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:50.633
Nothing costs more than 100 yuan

22
00:00:51.066 --> 00:00:52.866
How could he possibly come up with nine

23
00:00:52.866 --> 00:00:55.066
The mysterious billionaire holds on

24
00:00:57.133 --> 00:00:58.866
Hey Hei

25
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.966
Haven't you ever heard of a saying called

26
00:01:00.966 --> 00:01:02.366
Don't you want to be exposed?

27
00:01:02.366 --> 00:01:06.800
Could it be that your city lord's vision is not as good as yours?

28
00:01:07.733 --> 00:01:08.800
nothing to know

29
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.666
Let's make a bet

30
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:14.400
If it really comes out to 5 billion

31
00:01:14.533 --> 00:01:16.200
I'm going to repay you, okay?

32
00:00:00.666 --> 00:00:01.833
Mr. Zhang is not good

33
00:00:05.666 --> 00:00:07.266
Misunderstanding

34
00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:09.266
What is the matter, tell me

35
00:00:09.266 --> 00:00:11.633
Other foreign financial groups continue to raise their share prices

36
00:00:11.666 --> 00:00:13.066
The amount we need

37
00:00:13.066 --> 00:00:15.633
I am afraid it is 5 billion

38
00:00:16.066 --> 00:00:18.200
We put the companies together.

39
00:00:18.366 --> 00:00:20.366
I am afraid I can't come up with that much money

40
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.266
So you mean

41
00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.166
I am afraid I will have to let a foreign company take over

42
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:26.700
I am so unwilling

43
00:00:26.733 --> 00:00:28.033
Jiangcheng actually

44
00:00:29.266 --> 00:00:31.000
Now you do not have to worry.

45
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.500
Because I invited a mysterious billionaire

46
00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.933
He can solve all our problems for us.

47
00:00:36.933 --> 00:00:38.866
Are you saying

48
00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:40.633
Exactly.

49
00:00:41.666 --> 00:00:45.266
Does he look like a mysterious billionaire?

50
00:00:45.466 --> 00:00:47.000
You see how he is dressed.

51
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.700
The whole body probably adds up

52
00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:50.633
Nothing over 100 yuan

53
00:00:51.066 --> 00:00:52.866
How could he possibly take out nine?

54
00:00:52.866 --> 00:00:55.066
The mysterious billionaire holds on

55
00:00:57.133 --> 00:00:58.866
Hey, Blackie

56
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.966
Haven't you ever heard a saying called

57
00:01:00.966 --> 00:01:02.366
Is it not exposed?

58
00:01:02.366 --> 00:01:06.800
Do you think the eyes of the city lord are not as good as yours?

59
00:01:07.733 --> 00:01:08.800
There's nothing to know.

60
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.666
So let's make a bet

61
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:14.400
If there are really 5 billion

62
00:01:14.533 --> 00:01:16.200
I want to repay you, okay?
