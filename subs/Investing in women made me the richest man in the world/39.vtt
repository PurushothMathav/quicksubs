00:00:03.866 --> 00:00:06.400
Speaking of which, if you want to deal with good criminals

2
00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:07.766
But I don't have enough money

3
00:00:08.066 --> 00:00:09.566
You have to think of other ways

4
00:00:09.666 --> 00:00:11.800
Hey, you eat shrimp, Lin Yao

5
00:00:12.466 --> 00:00:14.833
I'm sorry for you

6
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:16.966
Jia Yang, let go

7
00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:18.566
You still have the nerve to not see me?

8
00:00:18.566 --> 00:00:20.900
That was all because he was a bitch and forced me to do so.

9
00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.500
He threatened me if I didn't follow him

10
00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:24.600
He's going to kill you

11
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.133
You said I love you so much

12
00:00:26.133 --> 00:00:28.166
I definitely can't bear him hurting you

13
00:00:28.166 --> 00:00:29.233
So I just

14
00:00:29.333 --> 00:00:30.133
I will

15
00:00:30.766 --> 00:00:31.700
This foot

16
00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:32.900
You still want to think I'm a fool

17
00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:34.066
what do you want to play

18
00:00:34.066 --> 00:00:35.566
I'll have fun with you

19
00:00:36.666 --> 00:00:38.700
Come on, sit down first

20
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.300
I'll go to the restroom and be right back

21
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.200
Does Lei Tianhu want to earn another 1 million?

22
00:00:48.366 --> 00:00:50.833
This poor guy's life is not going well

23
00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:53.200
No, I have to try

24
00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.966
What if he's really that bad?

25
00:00:55.133 --> 00:00:57.433
Then I can't let go of this cash machine.

26
00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.900
Actually, I thought about it carefully

27
00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:03.766
Can also understand

28
00:01:03.966 --> 00:01:06.466
After all, I'm just a poor loser

29
00:01:06.466 --> 00:01:09.366
Isn't it reasonable for you to follow Fei Jian?

30
00:01:09.466 --> 00:01:11.466
Is that all in the past?

31
00:01:11.466 --> 00:01:13.800
Don’t you make money now?

32
00:01:13.966 --> 00:01:14.500
I listen

33
00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:18.300
Say you paid 500,000 for Xu Qing’s mother’s medical expenses

34
00:01:18.333 --> 00:01:20.466
But it’s a big sum

35
00:01:22.066 --> 00:01:25.366
Actually, I borrowed this 500,000 yuan

36
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:27.866
No borrowed ones

37
00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.433
You owe me that 100, right?

38
00:01:30.533 --> 00:01:32.300
When will the 5 million be paid back?

39
00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.533
Hu Tian, ​​didn’t we agree that it would be 1 million?

40
00:01:35.533 --> 00:01:38.466
It’s already 5 million. I owe 5 million.

41
00:01:38.566 --> 00:01:40.100
Yaoyao, don’t worry

42
00:01:40.333 --> 00:01:42.000
As long as you are willing to be with me

43
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.200
The two of us work together

44
00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.766
I will definitely be able to repay the money.

45
00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:46.766
This is your girlfriend

46
00:01:46.766 --> 00:01:48.466
Looks pretty exciting

47
00:01:48.466 --> 00:01:49.266
Otherwise

48
00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:51.200
Sell ​​her to a brothel to pay you back

49
00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.333
who is your friend

50
00:01:52.333 --> 00:01:54.866
I have nothing to do with this poor loser.

51
00:01:54.866 --> 00:01:56.533
Yaoyao, how can you cure it?

52
00:01:56.533 --> 00:01:57.366
Get your dirty

53
00:01:57.366 --> 00:01:58.266
don't touch me

54
00:01:58.266 --> 00:02:01.400
When I meet you, I will be unlucky for eight lifetimes.

55
00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:05.200
Hey, I snatched it away and won’t let you go?

56
00:02:05.366 --> 00:02:06.200
Otherwise

57
00:02:06.733 --> 00:02:08.033
You play with us

58
00:02:08.133 --> 00:02:09.666
How about 300 at a time?

59
00:02:10.066 --> 00:02:11.266
Get out of here

60
00:02:11.266 --> 00:02:13.700
I don’t want to stay in this shitty place for even a second.

61
00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.700
As expected, Antelope's money was all borrowed.

62
00:00:03.866 --> 00:00:06.400
In other words, if you want to deal with a good criminal

63
00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:07.766
But I do not have enough money

64
00:00:08.066 --> 00:00:09.566
Have to think of another way

65
00:00:09.666 --> 00:00:11.800
Hey, eat shrimp, Lin Yao

66
00:00:12.466 --> 00:00:14.833
I am sorry.

67
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:16.966
Jia Yang, let go

68
00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:18.566
You still have the face not to see me?

69
00:00:18.566 --> 00:00:20.900
That is all cheap, he forced me

70
00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.500
He threatened me that I wouldn't talk to him

71
00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:24.600
He is going to kill you.

72
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.133
You say I love you so much

73
00:00:26.133 --> 00:00:28.166
I wouldn't have wanted him to hurt you.

74
00:00:28.166 --> 00:00:29.233
So I just

75
00:00:29.333 --> 00:00:30.133
I just

76
00:00:30.766 --> 00:00:31.700
This foot

77
00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:32.900
Still want to think I am a fool

78
00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:34.066
What do you want to play?

79
00:00:34.066 --> 00:00:35.566
I will have fun with you.

80
00:00:36.666 --> 00:00:38.700
Come on, sit down first

81
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.300
I will be right back in the bathroom

82
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.200
Lei Tianhu wants to earn 1 million

83
00:00:48.366 --> 00:00:50.833
This poor man is not having a good time

84
00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:53.200
No I have to try

85
00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.966
What if he is really that bad?

86
00:00:55.133 --> 00:00:57.433
Then I can't put away this ATM.

87
00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.900
Actually, I thought about it carefully

88
00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:03.766
Also understand

89
00:01:03.966 --> 00:01:06.466
After all, I am a poor loser

90
00:01:06.466 --> 00:01:09.366
It makes sense for you to follow the cheap guys

91
00:01:09.466 --> 00:01:11.466
Is that all in the past?

92
00:01:11.466 --> 00:01:13.800
You are making money now.

93
00:01:13.966 --> 00:01:14.500
I listen

94
00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:18.300
Said you paid 500,000 medical bills for Xu Qing's mother

95
00:01:18.333 --> 00:01:20.466
But it is a lot.

96
00:01:22.066 --> 00:01:25.366
Actually, I borrowed 500,000

97
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:27.866
Borrow no

98
00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.433
You owe me that 100

99
00:01:30.533 --> 00:01:32.300
When will 5 million return it?

100
00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.533
Hu Tian, ​​didn't we agree, it was 1 million

101
00:01:35.533 --> 00:01:38.466
It is 5 million. I owe 5 million

102
00:01:38.566 --> 00:01:40.100
Yaoyao, do not worry.

103
00:01:40.333 --> 00:01:42.000
As long as you are willing to be with me

104
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.200
We work together.

105
00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.766
I will definitely be able to pay the money back

106
00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:46.766
Is this your girlfriend?

107
00:01:46.766 --> 00:01:48.466
It is quite exciting

108
00:01:48.466 --> 00:01:49.266
How about this?

109
00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:51.200
Sell ​​her to the kiln to pay you back

110
00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.333
Who is your friend?

111
00:01:52.333 --> 00:01:54.866
I have nothing to do with this poor loser

112
00:01:54.866 --> 00:01:56.533
Yaoyao, how can you treat

113
00:01:56.533 --> 00:01:57.366
Put your dirty

114
00:01:57.366 --> 00:01:58.266
Do not touch me

115
00:01:58.266 --> 00:02:01.400
It has been eight lifetimes since I met you

116
00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:05.200
Hey, I took it away and will not let you go?

117
00:02:05.366 --> 00:02:06.200
How about this?

118
00:02:06.733 --> 00:02:08.033
You play with us

119
00:02:08.133 --> 00:02:09.666
How about 300 at a time?

120
00:02:10.066 --> 00:02:11.266
You go away

121
00:02:11.266 --> 00:02:13.700
I do not want to stay in this place for a second

122
00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.700
The money of the antelope is indeed borrowed
