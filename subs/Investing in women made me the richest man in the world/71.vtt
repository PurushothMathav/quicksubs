operations

2
00:00:09.066 --> 00:00:10.233
Don't force him

3
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:11.866
give him some time

4
00:00:12.733 --> 00:00:15.733
But the three of us have never been clear about it.

5
00:00:15.733 --> 00:00:16.800
Drag it on?

6
00:00:17.866 --> 00:00:19.600
It won't drag on forever

7
00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:24.900
Lin Yang

8
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.500
Do you remember the park behind Aliceton?

9
00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:30.766
Remember what happened to the park?

10
00:00:30.766 --> 00:00:34.833
There are two towering trees to the east and one to the west.

11
00:00:35.166 --> 00:00:37.000
I will wait for you in the east

12
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.366
Then I'll wait in the west

13
00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.066
before sunset today

14
00:00:41.166 --> 00:00:42.900
If you think clearly

15
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.900
Just come and find us there.

16
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.433
I'm waiting for you

17
00:00:52.733 --> 00:00:55.700
You bastard, I'm waiting for you too

18
00:01:25.566 --> 00:01:26.366
Leah

19
00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.066
This is what you are

20
00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.300
I know you will choose Xu Xiu

21
00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.400
But I don't want to give up either

22
00:01:37.533 --> 00:01:39.966
I don't know who you will choose either

23
00:01:39.966 --> 00:01:41.433
But it's better than just waiting

24
00:01:41.466 --> 00:01:43.666
I would rather take the initiative to do something

25
00:01:43.866 --> 00:01:45.900
Today you have to choose one

26
00:01:48.933 --> 00:01:51.566
You are making it difficult for me to do this.

27
00:01:55.333 --> 00:01:56.566
and the sun

28
00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:08.200
operate

29
00:00:09.066 --> 00:00:10.233
Do not push him

30
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:11.866
Give him some time.

31
00:00:12.733 --> 00:00:15.733
But the three of us have been so unclear

32
00:00:15.733 --> 00:00:16.800
Drag it down?

33
00:00:17.866 --> 00:00:19.600
It will not go on forever

34
00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:24.900
Lin Yang

35
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.500
Do you remember the park behind Elyston?

36
00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:30.766
Remember what happened to the park?

37
00:00:30.766 --> 00:00:34.833
There is a towering tree to the east and a towering tree to the west

38
00:00:35.166 --> 00:00:37.000
I will wait for you in the east

39
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.366
Then I will wait in the west

40
00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.066
Before sunset today

41
00:00:41.166 --> 00:00:42.900
If you think it through

42
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.900
Come find us there

43
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.433
I am waiting for you.

44
00:00:52.733 --> 00:00:55.700
Stinky rascal, I am waiting for you too

45
00:01:25.566 --> 00:01:26.366
Leah

46
00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.066
You are

47
00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.300
I know you will choose Xu Xiu

48
00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.400
But I do not want to give up either.

49
00:01:37.533 --> 00:01:39.966
I do not know who you will choose

50
00:01:39.966 --> 00:01:41.433
But rather than waiting

51
00:01:41.466 --> 00:01:43.666
I'd rather take the initiative to do something

52
00:01:43.866 --> 00:01:45.900
You must choose one today

53
00:01:48.933 --> 00:01:51.566
You make it hard for me to do this.
