Can earn another 1 million

3
00:00:10.533 --> 00:00:11.966
Xiaoqing, Liyang

4
00:00:12.266 --> 00:00:14.100
Guess where I am now?

5
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:17.300
I'm in Jiangcheng Furniture Mall now.

6
00:00:17.366 --> 00:00:19.566
Our new home is empty

7
00:00:19.566 --> 00:00:21.000
I want to fill it up

8
00:00:21.066 --> 00:00:23.166
This way it feels more like home

9
00:00:23.166 --> 00:00:24.366
This is our home

10
00:00:24.366 --> 00:00:25.866
I'll dance with you now

11
00:00:27.266 --> 00:00:28.066
Xiaoqing

12
00:00:28.933 --> 00:00:30.900
Xiaoqing, I ask you, don’t be anxious

13
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:31.900
This is very close to Xiaoyu City

14
00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:33.966
I know a small road that will take you there in 5 minutes, okay?

15
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.100
Hey brother

16
00:00:37.166 --> 00:00:39.700
I remember the parking spot in the video is right there.

17
00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.066
Xiaoqiang, if you want to save me, let me go

18
00:00:44.066 --> 00:00:44.866
don't want

19
00:00:45.733 --> 00:00:46.533
ah

20
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.600
Big brother, big brother, big brother, brake

21
00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:06.466
Brother, brother, are you okay?

22
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:07.400
It's all my fault

23
00:01:08.566 --> 00:01:09.933
Xiaojin, it's okay, it's okay

24
00:01:09.933 --> 00:01:10.866
i got you

25
00:01:10.866 --> 00:01:11.900
He will be interrogated later

26
00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:14.233
I'll definitely be able to find out what they always say.

27
00:01:14.666 --> 00:01:16.233
Where did you put the little gold?

28
00:01:17.166 --> 00:01:17.966
Don't say it, right?

29
00:01:17.966 --> 00:01:20.533
Okay, don’t you like bullying girls?

30
00:01:20.533 --> 00:01:21.900
Give me his lower body

31
00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.800
Let him never be a man in this life

32
00:01:24.333 --> 00:01:26.766
I walk around the world with loyalty

33
00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.000
You can't pry a word out of my mouth

34
00:00:00.966 --> 00:00:04.366
What else does Brother Ming have to do recently?

35
00:00:04.566 --> 00:00:06.000
To earn another 1 million

36
00:00:10.533 --> 00:00:11.966
Xiaoqing, Liyang

37
00:00:12.266 --> 00:00:14.100
Guess where I am now?

38
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:17.300
I am now in Jiangcheng Furniture City

39
00:00:17.366 --> 00:00:19.566
Our new home is empty

40
00:00:19.566 --> 00:00:21.000
I am going to fill it up.

41
00:00:21.066 --> 00:00:23.166
It feels more like home

42
00:00:23.166 --> 00:00:24.366
This is our home.

43
00:00:24.366 --> 00:00:25.866
I will dance with you now.

44
00:00:27.266 --> 00:00:28.066
XiaoQing

45
00:00:28.933 --> 00:00:30.900
Xiaoqing, I ask you, do not worry.

46
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:31.900
This is very close to Xiaoyu City

47
00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:33.966
I know a back road. It'll be there in five minutes

48
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.100
Hey big brother

49
00:00:37.166 --> 00:00:39.700
I remember the parking spot in the video was there

50
00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.066
Xiaoqiang, you have to save me, let me go

51
00:00:44.066 --> 00:00:44.866
No.

52
00:00:45.733 --> 00:00:46.533
Ah!

53
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.600
Big brother big brother brake

54
00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:06.466
Brother, are you alright?

55
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:07.400
It is all my fault

56
00:01:08.566 --> 00:01:09.933
Xiaojin, it is alright, it is alright

57
00:01:09.933 --> 00:01:10.866
I got you!

58
00:01:10.866 --> 00:01:11.900
I will try him later.

59
00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:14.233
You can definitely ask what they always say

60
00:01:14.666 --> 00:01:16.233
Where did you put Xiaojin?

61
00:01:17.166 --> 00:01:17.966
Do not say it, right?

62
00:01:17.966 --> 00:01:20.533
Okay, do not you like to bully girls?

63
00:01:20.533 --> 00:01:21.900
Destroy him for me

64
00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.800
Let him never be a man for the rest of his life

65
00:01:24.333 --> 00:01:26.766
Lao Tzu walks the rivers and lakes to talk about loyalty

66
00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.000
You can never pry a word out of my mouth
