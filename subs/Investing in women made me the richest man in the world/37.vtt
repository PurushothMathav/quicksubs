00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:01.360
How is that possible?

2
00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:02.600
Since I said it

3
00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:03.920
I want to support you

4
00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:05.160
I will never regret it

5
00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:06.480
That

6
00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:07.400
do you think

7
00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:08.720
I'm stupid

8
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Stupid or not?

9
00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:12.240
I didn't mean that

10
00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:15.400
Lin Yang, what are you doing?

11
00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:17.000
Lin Yang

12
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Xiao Xiaoqing you

13
00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:19.280
You get up first

14
00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:20.560
Then you say it first

15
00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.120
Do you think I'm stupid?

16
00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:24.360
Pressed on me

17
00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:31.760
Xiaoqing

18
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.280
so hot

19
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:43.600
Lin Yang

20
00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:46.120
Actually, I guessed it all

21
00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:47.760
the money you gave me

22
00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.280
You borrowed it from someone else, right?

23
00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.160
That's not true

24
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:54.800
You don't have to be afraid of me

25
00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:55.760
The psychological burden is too great

26
00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:57.040
your thoughts

27
00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.000
I understand

28
00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:59.280
Xiaoqing, don’t get me wrong.

29
00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:01.160
I am really rich now

30
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:02.800
Don't lie to me

31
00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:04.400
Ever since you were admitted to college

32
00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:05.680
After expulsion

33
00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:06.640
Haven't found it yet

34
00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:07.920
What a decent job

35
00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:09.520
how could you

36
00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:10.480
Can all of a sudden

37
00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:11.440
Take out so much money

38
00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:13.960
The matter of buying me the bar

39
00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.560
He's acting too, right?

40
00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:16.880
I swear

41
00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:17.840
I am really rich now

42
00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:19.400
That bar

43
00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:21.320
It's the gift I gave you

44
00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:22.640
Don't worry

45
00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:24.840
I've already thought everything through

46
00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:26.440
I returned the house I rented

47
00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:28.080
What about the future

48
00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.000
Let's live together

49
00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:30.320
Save a month

50
00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:31.280
Half the rent?

51
00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:32.560
we

52
00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:33.800
Be more frugal

53
00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:35.720
I can definitely pay off my debt.

54
00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:37.320
You oops

55
00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:38.960
What do you want me to say

56
00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.240
Only you can believe it

57
00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.200
I'm really rich now

58
00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:42.480
we

59
00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:42.800
No need to live a hard life anymore

60
00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.040
Don't lie to me

61
00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:46.600
If you are really rich

62
00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:47.920
You take out the money now

63
00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.200
show me

64
00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:49.840
I

65
00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:52.080
My money

66
00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:53.040
Can't be used to watch

67
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.000
can only be used

68
00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:55.280
I'll take care of you

69
00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:56.880
Lin Yang

70
00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:57.840
I'm in your heart

71
00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:58.480
That's it

72
00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:59.120
A materialistic woman?

73
00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:00.680
I don't blame you

74
00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.320
I just want

75
00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:02.960
with you

76
00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:04.840
Live a down-to-earth life

77
00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.039
I don't even know what to do

78
00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:09.360
I explained it to you

79
00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:10.600
Then don't explain

80
00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:12.560
us

81
00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:13.200
Let's work together, shall we?

82
00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:14.480
Um

83
00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.320
After this matter is completed

84
00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:19.880
Lin Yang is finished

85
00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:22.800
Come
