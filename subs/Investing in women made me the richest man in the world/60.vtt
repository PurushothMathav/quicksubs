00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.866
Zhao Yu is now obviously following Lei Tian Studio

2
00:00:05.866 --> 00:00:07.266
But suddenly ran here

3
00:00:07.266 --> 00:00:09.800
Is there any problem?

4
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.200
Mr. Yo Lin

5
00:00:12.333 --> 00:00:14.666
Brother Lin, haha, why are you here?

6
00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:16.966
I didn't expect you bitch

7
00:00:16.966 --> 00:00:19.066
I also know a big shot like Mr. Lin

8
00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:19.900
Ha ha

9
00:00:20.066 --> 00:00:22.266
Didn’t I ask you to follow Lei Tianhu?

10
00:00:22.266 --> 00:00:23.533
What are you doing here?

11
00:00:23.533 --> 00:00:25.766
Oh, Brother Li, you don’t know something?

12
00:00:25.766 --> 00:00:28.766
Uh, this bitch owes Brother Tiger 2 million

13
00:00:28.766 --> 00:00:30.700
I'm helping Brother Hu collect debts now.

14
00:00:30.966 --> 00:00:31.800
You

15
00:00:32.666 --> 00:00:34.233
Owe gambling 2 million

16
00:00:34.266 --> 00:00:36.033
Only you can save me now

17
00:00:36.133 --> 00:00:37.900
Lei Tianhu has always been with me

18
00:00:37.933 --> 00:00:40.000
Why haven't you heard him say this?

19
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.500
Hahaha

20
00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.366
He really owes Lei Tianhu 2 million

21
00:00:46.366 --> 00:00:47.933
Brother Zhen Wan Quelei

22
00:00:47.933 --> 00:00:51.333
Ever since I followed Brother Hu, I have been fond of new things.

23
00:00:51.333 --> 00:00:53.333
Now I am only responsible for collecting debts

24
00:00:53.333 --> 00:00:54.633
Never take the initiative to deceive people

25
00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:57.200
This bitch never knows how to drink.

26
00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:58.966
Plan to deceive first, brother

27
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.466
Drink tea first and take your time.

28
00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:14.633
Can't drink

29
00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.566
Police, are you fucking crazy?

30
00:01:23.566 --> 00:01:25.066
I can't do anything wrong again

31
00:01:25.266 --> 00:01:25.866
Not that

32
00:01:25.866 --> 00:01:28.266
Okay, let's play ballad together. Can we get this fool's money?

33
00:01:28.366 --> 00:01:30.466
You bitch is so fucking mean

34
00:01:30.566 --> 00:01:33.800
Just damn close

35
00:01:34.366 --> 00:01:36.100
Just get it for billions

36
00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:40.766
I won’t fucking pretend anymore

37
00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.066
Just don't do anything at all

38
00:01:43.266 --> 00:01:45.500
I'll fucking kill you both.

39
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.866
Zhao Yu is now clearly following Lei Tian Studio

40
00:00:05.866 --> 00:00:07.266
But suddenly ran here

41
00:00:07.266 --> 00:00:09.800
Is there a problem?

42
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.200
Mr. Yolin

43
00:00:12.333 --> 00:00:14.666
Brother Lin, haha, why are you here?

44
00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:16.966
I didn't expect you to be a bitch

45
00:00:16.966 --> 00:00:19.066
I also know big people like Mr. Lin

46
00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:19.900
Ha ha.

47
00:00:20.066 --> 00:00:22.266
Didn't I ask you to follow Lei Tianhu?

48
00:00:22.266 --> 00:00:23.533
What are you doing here?

49
00:00:23.533 --> 00:00:25.766
Oh, Brother Li, do you know something?

50
00:00:25.766 --> 00:00:28.766
Uh, this bitch owes Tiger 2 million

51
00:00:28.766 --> 00:00:30.700
I am helping Brother Hu to collect debts now

52
00:00:30.966 --> 00:00:31.800
You

53
00:00:32.666 --> 00:00:34.233
Owe gambling 2 million

54
00:00:34.266 --> 00:00:36.033
Now only you can save me

55
00:00:36.133 --> 00:00:37.900
Lei Tianhu has always been with me

56
00:00:37.933 --> 00:00:40.000
Why haven't I heard him say this?

57
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.500
Hahaha

58
00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.366
He really owes Lei Tianhu 2 million money

59
00:00:46.366 --> 00:00:47.933
Zhenwanzhoulei

60
00:00:47.933 --> 00:00:51.333
I have been looking forward to a new look since I followed Brother Tiger

61
00:00:51.333 --> 00:00:53.333
I am only responsible for collecting the arrests now

62
00:00:53.333 --> 00:00:54.633
Never take the initiative to deceive people

63
00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:57.200
This bitch will never drink

64
00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:58.966
Plan to receive first, bro

65
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.466
Drink tea first and take your time.

66
00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:14.633
You can't drink it.

67
00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.566
Police, are you fucking crazy?

68
00:01:23.566 --> 00:01:25.066
I can't do anything wrong again.

69
00:01:25.266 --> 00:01:25.866
Not that

70
00:01:25.866 --> 00:01:28.266
Okay, let's put together ballads for this fool's money?

71
00:01:28.366 --> 00:01:30.466
You bitch is so fucking cheap

72
00:01:30.566 --> 00:01:33.800
Almost, almost fucking

73
00:01:34.366 --> 00:01:36.100
Billions are coming in.

74
00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:40.766
I am not faking it anymore

75
00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.066
Just do not do it all the time

76
00:01:43.266 --> 00:01:45.500
Kill you both
