00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.833
Yueying is still busy

2
00:00:11.133 --> 00:00:12.700
Fed up with the fan family's industry

3
00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:14.266
I'm almost exhausted

4
00:00:14.333 --> 00:00:16.900
Even if you raise that bastard, you won't come to help.

5
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.466
Liu Rui didn’t know what was wrong.

6
00:00:18.466 --> 00:00:19.800
I don’t know the status lately

7
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.266
That's it

8
00:00:22.133 --> 00:00:24.200
That's such a shame

9
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.666
You work hard first

10
00:00:25.666 --> 00:00:29.466
I can only go on a date with the antelope alone.

11
00:00:29.866 --> 00:00:33.033
Isn’t it a matter of agreeing to disagree on a date?

12
00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:35.933
A man as good as a sheep

13
00:00:35.933 --> 00:00:37.866
Of course it's first come first served

14
00:00:37.866 --> 00:00:40.800
You're just kidding. Okay, I won't tell you anymore.

15
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:41.666
Antelope is coming

16
00:00:41.666 --> 00:00:43.666
Just be the workaholic you are

17
00:00:49.266 --> 00:00:51.166
Oh ah ah

18
00:00:51.166 --> 00:00:53.500
Who are you calling? Are you so happy?

19
00:00:53.666 --> 00:00:54.866
ordinary friends

20
00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:56.800
Where is Lei Tianhu?

21
00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.100
Doesn't he want to be your bodyguard?

22
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.433
Why didn't you see him?

23
00:01:00.766 --> 00:01:03.366
I gave him a day off

24
00:01:04.066 --> 00:01:05.000
today

25
00:01:05.733 --> 00:01:07.366
I only belong to one person

26
00:01:11.166 --> 00:01:13.800
Ah, Li Ya, what are you doing?

27
00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:16.900
Help me come up

28
00:01:20.866 --> 00:01:22.500
Remember the last time we met

29
00:01:22.766 --> 00:01:25.166
You can get on the bus if you want to

30
00:01:25.166 --> 00:01:28.966
You hate who wants to do that with you

31
00:01:28.966 --> 00:01:31.033
I haven't said what it is yet

32
00:01:31.133 --> 00:01:32.500
You'll know

33
00:01:32.866 --> 00:01:35.800
Could it be that you have been thinking about it now?

34
00:01:38.933 --> 00:01:39.733
I'm a bit

35
00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:41.666
Can't wait

36
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.833
Yueying is still busy

37
00:00:11.133 --> 00:00:12.700
Fed up with the restaurant industry

38
00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:14.266
I am so busy

39
00:00:14.333 --> 00:00:16.900
You raise that bastard and refuse to help

40
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.466
Liu Rui doesn't know what is wrong

41
00:00:18.466 --> 00:00:19.800
I do not know the status recently.

42
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.266
I see.

43
00:00:22.133 --> 00:00:24.200
What a pity!

44
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.666
You work hard first

45
00:00:25.666 --> 00:00:29.466
I can only go on a date with the antelope alone

46
00:00:29.866 --> 00:00:33.033
Isn't dating agreed and disagreed?

47
00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:35.933
A man as good as a sheep

48
00:00:35.933 --> 00:00:37.866
On a first-come, first-served basis, of course.

49
00:00:37.866 --> 00:00:40.800
You played, okay, I will not tell you

50
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:41.666
Here comes the antelope

51
00:00:41.666 --> 00:00:43.666
Just be your workaholic

52
00:00:49.266 --> 00:00:51.166
Ohhh.

53
00:00:51.166 --> 00:00:53.500
Who are you calling? Are you so happy?

54
00:00:53.666 --> 00:00:54.866
ordinary friend

55
00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:56.800
What about Lei Tianhu?

56
00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.100
Isn't he going to be your bodyguard?

57
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.433
Why didn't you see him?

58
00:01:00.766 --> 00:01:03.366
I gave him a vacation

59
00:01:04.066 --> 00:01:05.000
today

60
00:01:05.733 --> 00:01:07.366
I belong to only one person

61
00:01:11.166 --> 00:01:13.800
Ah, Li Ya, what are you doing?

62
00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:16.900
You help me up

63
00:01:20.866 --> 00:01:22.500
Remember the last time we met

64
00:01:22.766 --> 00:01:25.166
You can get in the car if you want.

65
00:01:25.166 --> 00:01:28.966
You hate who wants to do that with you?

66
00:01:28.966 --> 00:01:31.033
I haven't said what it is yet.

67
00:01:31.133 --> 00:01:32.500
You will know

68
00:01:32.866 --> 00:01:35.800
Do you mean you have been thinking about it now?

69
00:01:38.933 --> 00:01:39.733
I am a little

70
00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:41.666
Can't wait
