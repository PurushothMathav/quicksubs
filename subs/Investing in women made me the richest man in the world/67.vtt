00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:04.433
How about taking off all my clothes now? Is it suitable for me?

2
00:00:06.333 --> 00:00:07.000
What nonsense are you talking about?

3
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.966
I just kept going up

4
00:00:08.966 --> 00:00:10.833
How can you take this seriously?

5
00:00:11.266 --> 00:00:14.066
Then if Xiaoyan, I want to take it seriously

6
00:00:14.766 --> 00:00:15.500
ridiculous

7
00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.700
Do you know what my lipstick and I are worth?

8
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:19.166
The number one brand in the live broadcast room

9
00:00:19.166 --> 00:00:20.700
The average person buys 1 million gifts

10
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:22.766
It's barely enough for me to do a striptease

11
00:00:22.933 --> 00:00:26.700
1 million is quite expensive for you.

12
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:27.566
You can do it

13
00:00:27.566 --> 00:00:29.133
You want me to strip naked and serve you

14
00:00:29.133 --> 00:00:30.800
It’s impossible without 10 million

15
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.733
Look at you poor loser, you smell like sweat all over your body

16
00:00:33.733 --> 00:00:34.966
Are you looking for coolies?

17
00:00:34.966 --> 00:00:36.800
The hero failed just now

18
00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.566
Spent all the money I had

19
00:00:38.566 --> 00:00:40.900
Even the stinky dick wants me to serve you

20
00:00:41.766 --> 00:00:44.166
Don't be so arrogant yet.

21
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.900
you you still have you

22
00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:49.033
Anyway, apart from this suggestion

23
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.700
All the rest are covered

24
00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.066
What did you say

25
00:00:53.066 --> 00:00:55.833
Although I am usually not picky about food,

26
00:00:55.866 --> 00:00:58.000
But I'm free

27
00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.866
Boss, you are a trash from the bottom of society.

28
00:00:59.866 --> 00:01:00.933
Why do you think I'm dirty?

29
00:01:00.933 --> 00:01:04.133
Although they say it is not as valuable as a partnership

30
00:01:04.133 --> 00:01:06.900
But they are all worth more than 3 million

31
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.266
I advise you to choose one carefully

32
00:01:09.266 --> 00:01:12.066
To prevent all the money in your pocket from being wasted

33
00:01:12.166 --> 00:01:13.900
Only children make choices

34
00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:16.366
I don't want any

35
00:01:16.366 --> 00:01:17.400
if i say

36
00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.200
I am the new and old horse in your live broadcast room

37
00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.700
Are you still unwilling to serve me?

38
00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:04.433
How about taking off my clothes now is it suitable for me?

39
00:00:06.333 --> 00:00:07.000
What nonsense?

40
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.966
I have been on it just now

41
00:00:08.966 --> 00:00:10.833
How can it be serious?

42
00:00:11.266 --> 00:00:14.066
Then if Xiaoyan, I want to take it seriously

43
00:00:14.766 --> 00:00:15.500
ridiculous

44
00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.700
Do you know what my lipstick and I are worth?

45
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:19.166
The first card in the live stream

46
00:00:19.166 --> 00:00:20.700
Most people 1 million gifts

47
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:22.766
That is barely enough for a striptease

48
00:00:22.933 --> 00:00:26.700
1 million, you are pretty expensive

49
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:27.566
How about you?

50
00:00:27.566 --> 00:00:29.133
Want me to strip naked to serve you

51
00:00:29.133 --> 00:00:30.800
It is impossible without 10 million

52
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.733
Look at you, poor guy, sweating all over

53
00:00:33.733 --> 00:00:34.966
Are you looking at coolies?

54
00:00:34.966 --> 00:00:36.800
The hero didn't show off just now

55
00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.566
Spend all my money

56
00:00:38.566 --> 00:00:40.900
Stinky dick also let me serve

57
00:00:41.766 --> 00:00:44.166
Do not be in a hurry to be arrogant

58
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.900
You and you and you

59
00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:49.033
Anyway, except for this suggestion

60
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.700
The rest are all inclusive

61
00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.066
Pardon me?

62
00:00:53.066 --> 00:00:55.833
I am not a picky eater.

63
00:00:55.866 --> 00:00:58.000
But I have free time.

64
00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.866
Boss, you rubbish at the bottom of society

65
00:00:59.866 --> 00:01:00.933
Why do you think I am dirty?

66
00:01:00.933 --> 00:01:04.133
Although they say that it is not as valuable as a partnership account

67
00:01:04.133 --> 00:01:06.900
But they are worth more than 3 million

68
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.266
I advise you to choose one well.

69
00:01:09.266 --> 00:01:12.066
Before all the money in my pocket goes to waste

70
00:01:12.166 --> 00:01:13.900
Kids make choices.

71
00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:16.366
I do not want any

72
00:01:16.366 --> 00:01:17.400
If I say

73
00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.200
I am the new and old horse in your live stream.

74
00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.700
Are you still unwilling to serve me?
