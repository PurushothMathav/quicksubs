00:00:03.366 --> 00:00:06.633
You said I asked Antelope to help Jiang Yao

2
00:00:07.266 --> 00:00:09.233
Did I do something wrong?

3
00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:11.266
Sister Zeng

4
00:00:12.133 --> 00:00:13.466
Actually, where is the eldest brother?

5
00:00:13.466 --> 00:00:15.500
What I like most is your kindness

6
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:16.900
There is nothing wrong with being kind

7
00:00:17.166 --> 00:00:21.366
It’s just that sometimes kindness is betrayed by people with ulterior motives.

8
00:00:21.533 --> 00:00:23.066
as a tool for use

9
00:00:24.933 --> 00:00:26.233
you are right

10
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:28.566
I was too soft-hearted just now

11
00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:30.566
You catch up with them immediately

12
00:00:30.566 --> 00:00:31.900
We must protect the antelopes

13
00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.166
It’s not brother. Don’t worry about me.

14
00:00:35.366 --> 00:00:37.300
What can I encounter at home?

15
00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:39.000
Antelope safety

16
00:00:39.333 --> 00:00:40.600
more important than anything

17
00:00:41.066 --> 00:00:43.166
Okay, I'll go right away

18
00:00:43.166 --> 00:00:44.700
Please stay at home well

19
00:00:45.266 --> 00:00:46.066
antelope

20
00:00:46.666 --> 00:00:48.566
You must not let anything happen to you

21
00:00:55.766 --> 00:00:56.866
What did you say

22
00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.566
Our mother suddenly became critically ill

23
00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:02.600
Brother, take good care of our mother

24
00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:03.900
I'll go to the hospital right away

25
00:01:07.166 --> 00:01:10.266
Do you think it's still possible for both of us?

26
00:01:11.533 --> 00:01:12.700
Absolutely impossible

27
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.100
Yes, you look like a bitch like me

28
00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.466
Who do you have to ask you to abuse me?

29
00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:24.600
three years

30
00:01:24.866 --> 00:01:26.833
It doesn’t mean that you can forget it if you forget it.

31
00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.033
everyone makes mistakes

32
00:01:29.166 --> 00:01:32.166
Everyone has a chance to change their ways

33
00:01:32.533 --> 00:01:33.333
you

34
00:01:33.766 --> 00:01:36.833
You mean you've forgiven me

35
00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:38.800
Let's go

36
00:00:03.366 --> 00:00:06.633
You said I asked the antelope to help Jiang Yao

37
00:00:07.266 --> 00:00:09.233
Did I do it wrong?

38
00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:11.266
Sister Zeng

39
00:00:12.133 --> 00:00:13.466
In fact, what about the big brother?

40
00:00:13.466 --> 00:00:15.500
What I like most is your kindness

41
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:16.900
There is nothing wrong with kindness

42
00:00:17.166 --> 00:00:21.366
It is just that sometimes kindness is overtaken by people with ulterior motives

43
00:00:21.533 --> 00:00:23.066
As a tool to use

44
00:00:24.933 --> 00:00:26.233
I guess you are right.

45
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:28.566
I was too soft-hearted just now

46
00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:30.566
You catch up with them now

47
00:00:30.566 --> 00:00:31.900
Be sure to protect the antelope

48
00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.166
It is not big brother, let me rest assured.

49
00:00:35.366 --> 00:00:37.300
What could happen to me at home?

50
00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:39.000
Antelope safety

51
00:00:39.333 --> 00:00:40.600
More important than anything

52
00:00:41.066 --> 00:00:43.166
Fine. I will be right there.

53
00:00:43.166 --> 00:00:44.700
Are you staying home?

54
00:00:45.266 --> 00:00:46.066
antelope

55
00:00:46.666 --> 00:00:48.566
Can't you be okay?

56
00:00:55.766 --> 00:00:56.866
Pardon me?

57
00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.566
Our mother suddenly fell ill

58
00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:02.600
Brother, take care of our mother

59
00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:03.900
I am going to the hospital right away

60
00:01:07.166 --> 00:01:10.266
Do you think it is possible for the two of us?

61
00:01:11.533 --> 00:01:12.700
Absolutely impossible

62
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.100
Yeah, like me

63
00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.466
What right do you have to ask you to abuse?

64
00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:24.600
Three years.

65
00:01:24.866 --> 00:01:26.833
It doesn't mean that you can forget it if you forget it.

66
00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.033
Everyone makes mistakes

67
00:01:29.166 --> 00:01:32.166
Everyone has a chance to make a change

68
00:01:32.533 --> 00:01:33.333
you

69
00:01:33.766 --> 00:01:36.833
You mean you have forgiven me?

70
00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:38.800
Come on.
