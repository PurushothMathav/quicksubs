﻿1
00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.766
Yeah hahaha

2
00:00:02.333 --> 00:00:03.133
Come in

3
00:00:05.333 --> 00:00:07.866
Did I let you do the backhand?

4
00:00:09.733 --> 00:00:11.500
Hey, tell me

5
00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.366
I let you force Xu Qin to beg me

6
00:00:14.366 --> 00:00:16.500
How is this matter going?

7
00:00:18.066 --> 00:00:18.866
backhand

8
00:00:19.533 --> 00:00:21.566
Sorry, this is my fault

9
00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:27.700
Open your mouth

10
00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:33.966
Oops

11
00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:38.900
This can be considered a half-leopard, hahaha

12
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.000
What's the use of hanging around me?

13
00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.300
You can't blame me for breaking up.

14
00:00:46.333 --> 00:00:48.233
Who knew there would be an antelope on the way?

15
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.266
Originally, this matter almost turned into an antelope.

16
00:00:51.333 --> 00:00:52.166
antelope

17
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.233
It’s a fucking antelope again

18
00:00:54.333 --> 00:00:56.833
It's strange to say that we broke up

19
00:00:57.666 --> 00:00:59.866
Who knew Antelope would suddenly be so rich?

20
00:00:59.866 --> 00:01:00.166
Why

21
00:01:00.166 --> 00:01:02.700
I paid all my mother's medical bills in advance

22
00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:04.633
I even bought that hospital.

23
00:01:05.666 --> 00:01:09.100
You don’t even know what I want from you?

24
00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.966
Stop being an eyesore here

25
00:01:12.866 --> 00:01:17.000
Let go of the 200,000 you promised me, hahaha

26
00:01:18.733 --> 00:01:21.266
You still have the nerve to ask for money?

27
00:01:21.366 --> 00:01:26.400
Believe it or not, I will break your legs. Get out of here.

28
00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.166
I'll make you pay for being a bitch

29
00:01:32.933 --> 00:01:34.333
Don't be angry

30
00:01:34.333 --> 00:01:35.166
Get rid of anger

31
00:01:35.666 --> 00:01:39.700
Why did Yang Yang suddenly have so much money?

32
00:01:40.333 --> 00:01:42.366
I'm really curious about this too

33
00:01:46.466 --> 00:01:47.433
otherwise

34
00:01:47.766 --> 00:01:52.200
You go try him again for me, hahahaha

35
00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.766
Hmm hahaha

36
00:00:02.333 --> 00:00:03.133
come in

37
00:00:05.333 --> 00:00:07.866
Backhand did I let you do it?

38
00:00:09.733 --> 00:00:11.500
Well, tell me about it.

39
00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.366
I asked you to force Xu Qin to beg me

40
00:00:14.366 --> 00:00:16.500
How's this going?

41
00:00:18.066 --> 00:00:18.866
backhand

42
00:00:19.533 --> 00:00:21.566
I am sorry it is my fault

43
00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:27.700
Open your mouth

44
00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:33.966
Ouch.

45
00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:38.900
This is also a half leopard, hahaha.

46
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.000
What is the use of circling around me?

47
00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.300
You can't blame me for the breakup

48
00:00:46.333 --> 00:00:48.233
Who knew that an antelope would be killed halfway

49
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.266
It was almost an antelope

50
00:00:51.333 --> 00:00:52.166
antelope

51
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.233
It is a fucking antelope again

52
00:00:54.333 --> 00:00:56.833
It is weird to say the breakup

53
00:00:57.666 --> 00:00:59.866
Who knew that antelopes were suddenly so rich?

54
00:00:59.866 --> 00:01:00.166
Hey

55
00:01:00.166 --> 00:01:02.700
I paid for my mother's medical bills in advance

56
00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:04.633
They even bought the hospital

57
00:01:05.666 --> 00:01:09.100
You do not even know what I want from you?

58
00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.966
Get out of here

59
00:01:12.866 --> 00:01:17.000
Let go of the 200,000 you promised me hahaha

60
00:01:18.733 --> 00:01:21.266
How the hell do you have the nerve to mention money?

61
00:01:21.366 --> 00:01:26.400
Believe it or not, I will break your leg for you, get out

62
00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.166
I will make you pay for being cheap

63
00:01:32.933 --> 00:01:34.333
Do not be angry.

64
00:01:34.333 --> 00:01:35.166
calm down

65
00:01:35.666 --> 00:01:39.700
You explain why Yang suddenly has so much money

66
00:01:40.333 --> 00:01:42.366
I am really curious about this too

67
00:01:46.466 --> 00:01:47.433
Otherwise

68
00:01:47.766 --> 00:01:52.200
You go and help me try him again, hahahaha.
