00:00:10.133 --> 00:00:13.000
You poor bastard still picks up bottles and sells them?

2
00:00:13.766 --> 00:00:16.133
How much are these things worth?

3
00:00:16.133 --> 00:00:16.866
You just pick it up

4
00:00:16.866 --> 00:00:18.900
I can't eat your grandma's illness for the rest of my life

5
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.200
Just your money.

6
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.533
Forget about paying your grandma's medical bills

7
00:00:23.533 --> 00:00:26.300
It's not enough to buy your grandma a coffin

8
00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:27.566
Pardon?

9
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:29.266
Ouch.

10
00:00:33.866 --> 00:00:35.700
Just a bitch like you

11
00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.500
It's not enough for you to hurt me with 10 lives

12
00:00:41.266 --> 00:00:42.566
What do you want?

13
00:00:44.333 --> 00:00:48.166
Don't tell me to let me go

14
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:03.400
grandma

15
00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.700
When will these days end?

16
00:01:07.133 --> 00:01:10.833
I'm useless. I can't even protect myself

17
00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:12.600
How can I protect you?

18
00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.333
Dear daughter, mom is here to pick you up from school

19
00:01:16.333 --> 00:01:18.800
I told you to take the bowl of soup back to taste today

20
00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:19.966
See if you like to walk

21
00:01:19.966 --> 00:01:22.600
Hey, mom, you only have your sister in your eyes now

22
00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:23.900
I'm so mad!

23
00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:25.933
You mispronounced mom all these years, brat

24
00:01:25.933 --> 00:01:28.433
What happened to the 18-year-old mother being nice to her sister?

25
00:01:30.933 --> 00:01:34.000
Hey, why did you bring my Xiaoyue's jade pendant?
