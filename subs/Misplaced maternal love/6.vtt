00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:01.800
I have explained the classmate situation to you.

2
00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:03.266
Your grandmother's illness is dangerous

3
00:00:03.266 --> 00:00:04.666
I can't do this together

4
00:00:04.733 --> 00:00:06.666
I arrived at the doctor a few days later.

5
00:00:06.733 --> 00:00:09.066
Please save my grandma

6
00:00:09.133 --> 00:00:11.233
He is my only relative

7
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:13.133
Can't lose him

8
00:00:13.133 --> 00:00:15.533
Our hospital doesn't want your brother

9
00:00:15.533 --> 00:00:18.300
But depending on your situation, I can't afford it.

10
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.466
Doctor doctor

11
00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.300
Please give my grandma medicine first, okay?

12
00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:26.966
Money, I must find a way

13
00:00:26.966 --> 00:00:28.100
You must find a way

14
00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:30.066
Please save him first, okay?

15
00:00:30.066 --> 00:00:32.333
Little girl, it's not that I don't save you.

16
00:00:32.333 --> 00:00:34.366
We need the money before we can take the medicine

17
00:00:36.766 --> 00:00:38.433
Yes, I anticipated

18
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.033
Can be sold for money

19
00:00:41.933 --> 00:00:45.066
Xiaoyu, this is when grandma picked you up

20
00:00:45.066 --> 00:00:46.766
The only letter on you

21
00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.466
Take it and find your family immediately

22
00:00:50.533 --> 00:00:52.900
Remember not to lose it.

23
00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.000
Mom, do we have to come to the hospital to cause so much trouble?

24
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.800
son

25
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.900
You were accidentally met by those two poor ghosts just now.

26
00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:06.500
They make a living by picking up trash.

27
00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.566
Maybe there are any viruses and bacteria on you?

28
00:01:08.566 --> 00:01:10.100
Mom will take you to check before you can rest assured.

29
00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:11.600
Hmm ok
