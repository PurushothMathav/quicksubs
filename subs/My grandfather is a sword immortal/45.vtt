00:00:01.366 --> 00:00:02.500
Pardon me?

2
00:00:03.066 --> 00:00:04.700
Deep Sea Star

3
00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:10.200
The Deep Sea Star is the most precious jewel in the world

4
00:00:10.733 --> 00:00:12.300
Even the Blue Phantom

5
00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:15.300
It's all just the scraps of the Deep Sea Star.

6
00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:18.033
Master Wang

7
00:00:19.366 --> 00:00:21.366
Don't be fooled by this kid

8
00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:23.066
This is the big guy.

9
00:00:23.066 --> 00:00:25.666
You said this Heart of the Deep was fake.

10
00:00:25.666 --> 00:00:29.033
Master Wang, who in the world

11
00:00:29.066 --> 00:00:31.700
Would you take a broken plastic bag and put it in a priceless treasure?

12
00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:33.833
Faith is right

13
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:35.866
This kid must have a counterfeit

14
00:00:35.866 --> 00:00:37.566
Isn't Master Bao Jinkong Jewelry?

15
00:00:37.566 --> 00:00:40.000
He knew at a glance whether it was true or not

16
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:40.800
cut

17
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.466
This is such a cookie

18
00:00:43.566 --> 00:00:44.466
Master Wang

19
00:00:45.133 --> 00:00:46.166
Thanks

20
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:48.500
And so forth.

21
00:00:49.066 --> 00:00:51.700
Little yakuza, are you afraid?

22
00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:54.033
Afraid of rolling away at this moment

23
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.266
I am not afraid of bugs in Li Yuyang's dictionary

24
00:00:57.266 --> 00:00:59.100
Then why don't you dare to let Master Feng swallow?

25
00:00:59.133 --> 00:01:00.333
Swallowing is fine

26
00:01:00.333 --> 00:01:01.733
It's just my stuff

27
00:01:01.733 --> 00:01:04.366
You can't let others swallow it for no reason

28
00:01:05.466 --> 00:01:06.966
What do you want?

29
00:01:06.966 --> 00:01:08.233
Very simple.

30
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.000
If this is the real Heart of the Deep

31
00:01:11.466 --> 00:01:12.466
You kneel down

32
00:01:12.466 --> 00:01:13.800
Impossible to admit wrong

33
00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.333
What the hell did you say?

34
00:01:15.333 --> 00:01:17.766
What? Are you scared?

35
00:01:18.066 --> 00:01:19.000
Get out if you're afraid
