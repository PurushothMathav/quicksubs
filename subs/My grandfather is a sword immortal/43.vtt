00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:02.966
Language gives 1 billion

2
00:00:07.666 --> 00:00:08.466
Princess

3
00:00:10.366 --> 00:00:12.533
Oh, even if you are a nonsense

4
00:00:12.533 --> 00:00:14.300
We have to button our head a little too

5
00:00:14.566 --> 00:00:16.300
A billion, you say?

6
00:00:17.166 --> 00:00:18.600
Then this poor boy

7
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.200
I'm not talking nonsense.

8
00:00:23.533 --> 00:00:26.433
Yu Yang has already credited the dowry to my father's account

9
00:00:26.666 --> 00:00:28.700
Yes sir

10
00:00:29.066 --> 00:00:32.600
This kid did transfer me 1 billion bride price

11
00:00:33.666 --> 00:00:34.600
But you are in a hurry

12
00:00:35.133 --> 00:00:37.400
I'll refund the money right away.

13
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.066
A billion aunts

14
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:41.500
It works for me

15
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.433
That's a billion.

16
00:00:48.933 --> 00:00:50.300
Put away the books

17
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.600
In addition, I have specially prepared something else

18
00:01:08.333 --> 00:01:09.800
Xie Jiacai

19
00:01:11.733 --> 00:01:13.166
Yunye Villa

20
00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:14.500
That's him!

21
00:01:15.933 --> 00:01:17.300
Limited edition number

22
00:01:17.466 --> 00:01:19.033
I'll give you a luxury car.

23
00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.900
And the most precious

24
00:01:22.966 --> 00:01:25.100
The price is immeasurable

25
00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.266
Blue Phantom

26
00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:33.266
Blue Phantom

27
00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.000
Isn't this the scrap of the Deep Sea Star?

28
00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:38.766
Ah this

29
00:01:40.266 --> 00:01:42.100
I heard some time ago

30
00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:43.633
This peerless jewelry

31
00:01:43.666 --> 00:01:45.966
Was bought at the auction

32
00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.300
It was bought by the current family

33
00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.600
Oh, that's right.

34
00:01:52.733 --> 00:01:55.633
I made a special trip to Mr. Wu to pay the bill

35
00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.566
Thank you.

36
00:01:58.266 --> 00:01:59.966
You're quite welcome.

37
00:02:00.866 --> 00:02:02.433
So thoughtful

38
00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.433
A bit smaller than some

39
00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:09.100
There are too many little yakuza who don't know what to do

40
00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.033
It's about to be concerned about sending a piece of leftover material.
