00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:03.466
I don't think you are looking for Miss Jiang.

2
00:00:03.466 --> 00:00:05.366
And to die

3
00:00:05.366 --> 00:00:08.000
What are you doing here?

4
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.800
Humph brat

5
00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:10.866
Who are you talking to?

6
00:00:10.866 --> 00:00:12.166
Did you know I'm your uncle?

7
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.433
You still have the face to say that you are my uncle

8
00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:16.033
My dad died that year

9
00:00:16.166 --> 00:00:17.500
My mom broke her leg.

10
00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.300
Not only will you help my mother and son?

11
00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:19.466
Is that so?

12
00:00:19.466 --> 00:00:22.300
My house even kicked us out

13
00:00:22.333 --> 00:00:24.366
Stop talking nonsense, how can I bullshit you

14
00:00:24.366 --> 00:00:25.733
Today I am helping the farmer

15
00:00:25.733 --> 00:00:27.233
I'll give you the rest. Come here

16
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.433
What is this?

17
00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:33.766
The pig is engaged to someone else

18
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:34.966
That's not possible.

19
00:00:34.966 --> 00:00:36.000
That's not possible.

20
00:00:36.866 --> 00:00:38.433
What's impossible?

21
00:00:38.566 --> 00:00:40.866
The introduction is the son of the Governor of Nanjiang

22
00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:42.266
Miss Jiang married him

23
00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.633
That's a climb.

24
00:00:44.266 --> 00:00:46.866
Hmph, do you think marrying you

25
00:00:46.866 --> 00:00:49.400
Is it possible for poor people who rent houses?

26
00:00:50.333 --> 00:00:52.366
I don't believe my Lord will marry someone else

27
00:00:52.466 --> 00:00:54.066
I'm going to find out.

28
00:00:54.933 --> 00:00:56.266
Yahaha

29
00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.233
Do you think Master Nong sent you an invitation?

30
00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.666
Do you want to invite you to a wedding party?

31
00:01:01.666 --> 00:01:03.066
Ah hum

32
00:01:03.066 --> 00:01:04.666
I want you to give up

33
00:01:04.666 --> 00:01:06.700
Don't be a toad and want to eat swan meat

34
00:01:08.366 --> 00:01:09.566
This is between me and my dream

35
00:01:09.566 --> 00:01:10.733
It's not your turn

36
00:01:10.733 --> 00:01:14.400
Hmph, stinky boy, I'm in charge of this.
