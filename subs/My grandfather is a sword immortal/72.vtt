00:00:10.266 --> 00:00:12.933
It's you who saved me before, didn't you?

2
00:00:12.933 --> 00:00:14.633
One moment at a time

3
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.233
You offend my Kenshin Temple

4
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.466
I will do justice

5
00:00:18.466 --> 00:00:21.300
This is Mao Zebing's last move

6
00:00:22.066 --> 00:00:24.766
So you have to be the confidant of my minister

7
00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.000
Hahahahaha

8
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.800
Did you hear that kid?

9
00:00:32.666 --> 00:00:36.566
Sword Immortal Palace Today

10
00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:39.600
I can't save you.

11
00:00:39.733 --> 00:00:41.866
No, not like this 4 adults

12
00:00:41.866 --> 00:00:43.366
I can't blame you for this.

13
00:00:43.666 --> 00:00:45.166
It's too deceiving now

14
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.200
No murder, it turns out that he was forced to do it helplessly

15
00:00:48.266 --> 00:00:51.500
What should I do if you talk nonsense?

16
00:00:51.866 --> 00:00:53.166
What are you thinking?

17
00:00:53.166 --> 00:00:54.900
Life boundaries

18
00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:58.700
You all saw it just now

19
00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:00.366
This kid

20
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.033
Since I want to kill in front of you

21
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.100
Can't spare him

22
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.000
According to you

23
00:01:08.133 --> 00:01:10.500
What do you think should be done?

24
00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:11.300
he

25
00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.300
A thousand knives and a thousand horses

26
00:01:13.666 --> 00:01:15.766
In Chuomianghui

27
00:01:16.333 --> 00:01:19.566
Oh, your feud runs so deep

28
00:01:20.133 --> 00:01:21.100
Lied

29
00:01:21.866 --> 00:01:23.166
Don't get him wrong

30
00:01:24.266 --> 00:01:25.833
I have no personal grudge against him

31
00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.966
I'm all for the Immortal Palace

32
00:01:29.466 --> 00:01:30.266
just now

33
00:01:31.066 --> 00:01:32.866
Keep saying that my Sword Immortal Palace

34
00:01:33.766 --> 00:01:35.566
I don't make him deformed

35
00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.100
I'm afraid my wire fell

36
00:01:37.866 --> 00:01:40.366
Will it be hard to convince?

37
00:01:40.666 --> 00:01:43.500
Speechless damn

38
00:01:44.733 --> 00:01:45.533
Bar
