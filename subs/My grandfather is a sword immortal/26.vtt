00:00:01.366 --> 00:00:03.200
Oh boy

2
00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:05.266
Hurry up and save the old man

3
00:00:05.266 --> 00:00:06.466
What about the old man?

4
00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:08.600
I will repay you well.

5
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:10.733
Hahaha, no need, old man, I'm really in a hurry.

6
00:00:10.733 --> 00:00:11.600
I'll go first

7
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:12.400
And so on.

8
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.166
What's so urgent for you?

9
00:00:15.466 --> 00:00:16.133
My fiancee?

10
00:00:16.133 --> 00:00:18.400
Being forced to get engaged to another man at night

11
00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:19.966
I have to get to their house before they do

12
00:00:19.966 --> 00:00:20.900
Take him away

13
00:00:21.566 --> 00:00:23.166
Is that so?

14
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.400
Boy

15
00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:25.566
I advise you

16
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.100
Don't go.

17
00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.266
Why is that?

18
00:00:28.266 --> 00:00:29.933
Isn't that obvious?

19
00:00:29.933 --> 00:00:32.400
Ah, it's not that my old man despises you.

20
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:33.800
You just went

21
00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.200
You can't bring your fiancee back

22
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.366
Old man, can you make it clear to me?

23
00:00:39.466 --> 00:00:41.366
Isn't that obvious?

24
00:00:41.366 --> 00:00:43.733
Ah look at your outfit

25
00:00:43.733 --> 00:00:45.466
If I'm not wrong

26
00:00:45.766 --> 00:00:47.533
Your fiancee's family

27
00:00:47.533 --> 00:00:49.933
You must think your family is poor.

28
00:00:49.933 --> 00:00:52.800
That's why I didn't let you two be together

29
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.000
You said you have no money or power now.

30
00:00:56.966 --> 00:00:59.766
What can he do if you go?

31
00:00:59.966 --> 00:01:01.333
But I have the ability now

32
00:01:01.333 --> 00:01:02.900
I will definitely be able to bring Meng Zhu back

33
00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:04.633
Oops boy

34
00:01:04.666 --> 00:01:08.300
You take this question too simply.

35
00:01:08.666 --> 00:01:11.466
You said if you snatched him back

36
00:01:11.533 --> 00:01:13.866
How does he deal with his family?

37
00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:18.100
Do you have the heart to watch your fiancee feel sad every day?

38
00:01:19.466 --> 00:01:21.033
Don't I have any money?

39
00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.866
Just watching the woman I love

40
00:01:22.866 --> 00:01:24.300
Marry another man?

41
00:01:24.666 --> 00:01:26.033
Hahahaha

42
00:01:26.266 --> 00:01:27.766
Of course not.

43
00:01:27.766 --> 00:01:30.133
Just now, the old man said

44
00:01:30.133 --> 00:01:32.000
You saved the old man's life

45
00:01:32.133 --> 00:01:33.466
Old man hum

46
00:01:33.466 --> 00:01:35.800
I will repay you well.

47
00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:38.300
Hey

48
00:01:38.933 --> 00:01:40.566
You have this ring.

49
00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:42.400
From now on?

50
00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.566
You can be as rich as any other country
