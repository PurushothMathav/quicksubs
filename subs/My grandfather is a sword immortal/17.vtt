00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:02.200
shut up

2
00:00:02.966 --> 00:00:06.033
I said you have no right to call me uncle

3
00:00:06.266 --> 00:00:07.933
Dad, stop talking

4
00:00:07.933 --> 00:00:09.900
When you were forced to die

5
00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:11.133
I told you so.

6
00:00:11.133 --> 00:00:12.800
He if I can't do you

7
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.166
Come home with me right now

8
00:00:15.766 --> 00:00:18.266
I really like Meng Po, I beg you not to take him away

9
00:00:18.266 --> 00:00:19.466
I do love him.

10
00:00:19.533 --> 00:00:22.066
Hey, what do you love him for?

11
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:23.866
Dessert sells breakfast

12
00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:25.533
Earn two or three thousand a month

13
00:00:25.533 --> 00:00:26.666
Harbin, take a look again.

14
00:00:26.666 --> 00:00:29.400
I will try my best

15
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.733
It's okay for you to have no money.

16
00:00:31.733 --> 00:00:34.300
I don't come from a background. What are you trying to do?

17
00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.300
Even if you work hard for a lifetime, you can save

18
00:00:37.266 --> 00:00:38.400
You can't

19
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.900
My daughter casually charges millions for a piece of jewelry

20
00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.400
Why did you marry me?

21
00:00:43.566 --> 00:00:45.733
Dad, I love you

22
00:00:45.733 --> 00:00:48.266
I would like to live this ordinary life with him

23
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.366
stingy

24
00:00:49.366 --> 00:00:53.300
When you told me you said he could take care of you

25
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.733
He can't even take care of his own wife

26
00:00:55.733 --> 00:00:57.300
Dad, enough

27
00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.600
Come home with me right now

28
00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:00.566
No, you're coming with me

29
00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.266
You saved this kid

30
00:01:02.266 --> 00:01:03.366
You know my temper

31
00:01:03.366 --> 00:01:05.400
I can't tell you how to hide.

32
00:01:05.933 --> 00:01:09.100
Dad don't want me please

33
00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:10.700
Don't go to jail!

34
00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.766
Then come home with me

35
00:01:16.166 --> 00:01:16.966
Yun'er

36
00:01:17.366 --> 00:01:18.233
Sorry.

37
00:01:19.066 --> 00:01:21.366
I can't live with you anymore

38
00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.433
You must live a good life

39
00:01:24.333 --> 00:01:25.800
Take care of Auntie

40
00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:27.233
Marry a good woman

41
00:01:27.366 --> 00:01:29.066
Then forget about me

42
00:01:29.566 --> 00:01:31.400
Princess don't go
