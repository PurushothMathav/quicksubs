00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:04.066
I'm sorry to disappoint you.

2
00:00:04.466 --> 00:00:07.100
I don't want to inherit anything gradually and gradually

3
00:00:07.733 --> 00:00:08.533
Why is that?

4
00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:10.700
The world of architecture rules the world

5
00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:12.766
How many people dream of a location?

6
00:00:12.766 --> 00:00:14.700
Besides, grandpa owes you

7
00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:16.400
Grandpa wants to compensate you.

8
00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:17.200
Grandpa

9
00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:18.766
I appreciate your kindness.

10
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.233
But

11
00:00:20.766 --> 00:00:22.100
That's not my goal.

12
00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:23.766
ambition is not here

13
00:00:24.666 --> 00:00:26.000
What do you want to do?

14
00:00:27.166 --> 00:00:28.400
Selling handwriting

15
00:00:28.466 --> 00:00:30.833
Hahahaha

16
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.666
Weird thing, aren't you kidding grandpa?

17
00:00:33.933 --> 00:00:35.800
Grandpa, I'm not kidding you.

18
00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.600
These few days of life are for me

19
00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.166
Just like Huang Liang's dream

20
00:00:39.466 --> 00:00:41.800
I just want to live my life calmly

21
00:00:43.766 --> 00:00:46.633
Don't you feel wronged then?

22
00:00:46.933 --> 00:00:48.033
Of course not.

23
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.200
Setting up a stall now is different from setting up a stall before

24
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.466
Money can't help it.

25
00:00:53.766 --> 00:00:55.466
Now I have money.

26
00:00:55.666 --> 00:00:57.000
Rich life

27
00:00:58.133 --> 00:00:59.766
Hahahaha

28
00:00:59.866 --> 00:01:01.266
You're right, too.

29
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.733
You have the life you want

30
00:01:03.733 --> 00:01:07.366
What grandpa forced on you may not be what you wanted

31
00:01:07.366 --> 00:01:08.500
That being the case

32
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.766
Then you go

33
00:01:11.133 --> 00:01:14.966
If you need anything in the future, you can come to Grandpa at any time.

34
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.466
Okay, I won't be polite.

35
00:01:17.666 --> 00:01:19.566
Hahahaha

36
00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:21.966
Honey, I'm back.

37
00:01:24.466 --> 00:01:25.266
husband

38
00:01:28.133 --> 00:01:30.133
Mom, you don't know yet

39
00:01:30.133 --> 00:01:31.166
Mom, who is this?

40
00:01:31.166 --> 00:01:32.333
That looks good

41
00:01:32.333 --> 00:01:34.966
I'm working now, it's great in the morning.

42
00:01:34.966 --> 00:01:36.866
Oh yeah, I already need to tell you.

43
00:01:37.133 --> 00:01:38.666
I have refused

44
00:01:38.666 --> 00:01:43.133
Aren't you going to be the owner of an insole pickup shop?

45
00:01:43.133 --> 00:01:44.566
What are you doing?

46
00:01:44.766 --> 00:01:47.366
Set up a stall to sell breakfast
