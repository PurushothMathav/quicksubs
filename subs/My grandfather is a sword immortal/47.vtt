1
00:00:01.133 --> 00:00:02.200
That's not possible.

2
00:00:02.533 --> 00:00:05.033
He, Li Yuyao, is a poor ghost who sells breakfast.

3
00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:06.000
How could he be me?

4
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.266
The True Heart of Shanghai

5
00:00:08.733 --> 00:00:10.033
That must be fake

6
00:00:10.166 --> 00:00:13.700
Master Wang, are you wrong? Thank you Shou

7
00:00:15.266 --> 00:00:17.366
How do you humiliate the old man and sneak attack

8
00:00:18.133 --> 00:00:20.766
But you can't say I'm wrong

9
00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:22.233
Come, tell me.

10
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:23.666
Why this simple pen

11
00:00:23.666 --> 00:00:25.633
Can execute with real identity

12
00:00:25.966 --> 00:00:28.200
That's a quality assurance I can't even buy

13
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.900
Hmm, I don't care.

14
00:00:31.333 --> 00:00:35.200
The old man has never made a mistake in identifying jewelry in his life

15
00:00:36.333 --> 00:00:39.200
Sir, if you don't believe me

16
00:00:39.466 --> 00:00:41.433
Although find someone else to verify

17
00:00:42.066 --> 00:00:43.666
If wrong

18
00:00:43.766 --> 00:00:46.400
I will gouge my eyes for you.

19
00:00:47.333 --> 00:00:49.233
The old man is dead, remember

20
00:00:49.533 --> 00:00:51.600
You are the one I asked to identify the jewelry.

21
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.200
I authenticate jewelry. I never lie to jewelry.

22
00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.266
It's impossible for me to tell lies

23
00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.866
Thank you little brother

24
00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.666
I owe you a favor

25
00:01:11.666 --> 00:01:14.033
What do you owe me?

26
00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.900
In my opinion

27
00:01:15.933 --> 00:01:17.633
lifetime

28
00:01:18.466 --> 00:01:21.500
The quality assurance of seeing Deep Sea Star

29
00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.300
It's a great kindness

30
00:01:32.566 --> 00:01:34.233
Yo this is so expensive

31
00:01:34.266 --> 00:01:35.966
No matter how expensive it is, you deserve it

32
00:01:44.966 --> 00:01:46.000
Oh, thank you kindly.

33
00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.433
The subject kowtows to me and admits his mistake
