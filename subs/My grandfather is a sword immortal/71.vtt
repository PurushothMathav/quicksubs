00:00:02.266 --> 00:00:04.633
Hahahahaha

2
00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:07.566
The four guardians of my Sword Immortal Palace have arrived

3
00:00:07.966 --> 00:00:09.366
You are dead.

4
00:00:09.366 --> 00:00:12.900
I said no matter who comes today, you have to die

5
00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.300
If they're like your old dog

6
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:16.800
right and wrong score

7
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.700
I broke up with them

8
00:00:19.266 --> 00:00:20.933
What a big breath

9
00:00:20.933 --> 00:00:21.833
Sword Immortal Sword

10
00:00:22.566 --> 00:00:23.600
Fight the world

11
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.033
Except for the ten miles that the ancestor suppressed the world

12
00:00:26.566 --> 00:00:29.766
These four guardians also contributed greatly

13
00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:32.266
Even if the magic weapon is in your hands

14
00:00:32.366 --> 00:00:34.200
They are not their opponents.

15
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.066
Your sister-in-law is dead

16
00:00:36.066 --> 00:00:38.366
He actually provoked the people who used the Guard Hall

17
00:00:38.466 --> 00:00:41.000
That's right, no matter how good he is, what can he do?

18
00:00:41.066 --> 00:00:42.766
Is he more powerful than the four great guardians?

19
00:00:42.766 --> 00:00:43.833
That is.

20
00:00:44.533 --> 00:00:46.466
Li Hang, go away

21
00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.966
Urgently ill adult, I am not our fault

22
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.900
Yeah, kid.

23
00:00:52.166 --> 00:00:55.233
Run for your life like a dog

24
00:00:55.333 --> 00:00:59.766
That might be enough to catch your breath for a day

25
00:00:59.966 --> 00:01:01.100
otherwise

26
00:01:01.766 --> 00:01:03.366
You back now

27
00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.400
It's so wet.

28
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.900
Old thing, you still dare to threaten at this time

29
00:01:10.366 --> 00:01:11.500
It's also sold for real.

30
00:01:13.566 --> 00:01:15.200
Cut you to pieces

31
00:01:15.733 --> 00:01:18.833
You dare, if you die

32
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.066
The family will come down from the sky to accompany them

33
00:01:24.266 --> 00:01:26.233
See if I dare

34
00:01:28.566 --> 00:01:29.400
Right here.

35
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.666
Can't kill me.

36
00:01:34.366 --> 00:01:37.166
Even if the emperor comes, he can't save you

37
00:01:37.166 --> 00:01:38.433
Stay under the moon
