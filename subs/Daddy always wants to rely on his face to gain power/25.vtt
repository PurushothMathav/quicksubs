1
00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:03.033
But his paper is rubbish

2
00:00:05.166 --> 00:00:07.466
Yan'er, why are you here?

3
00:00:08.866 --> 00:00:11.233
I think today's occasion

4
00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:14.300
We just need to learn from medical experience

5
00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:17.200
Stop questioning the master's words

6
00:00:21.933 --> 00:00:24.100
Dear, there you are.

7
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.800
I'll go see Mr. Liu later

8
00:00:25.933 --> 00:00:27.400
Do you want to go with me?

9
00:00:28.933 --> 00:00:30.900
Of course I'll be with you

10
00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:32.800
What do you know?

11
00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.400
And Master David's papers are rubbish.

12
00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.233
I should know a little better than you

13
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.966
His treatment method can only stop the bleeding externally.

14
00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.033
It's only going to get worse.

15
00:00:42.133 --> 00:00:44.266
Hemiplegia may occur after half a year

16
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.200
Or a language barrier

17
00:00:48.533 --> 00:00:49.333
Left Yin

18
00:00:49.766 --> 00:00:50.866
What are you doing here?

19
00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:54.000
Was Zuo Yin 7 years ago?

20
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.600
The Zuo Yin who was kicked out of the house

21
00:00:56.066 --> 00:00:58.133
This is a master doctor after all

22
00:00:58.133 --> 00:00:59.800
He actually said it was trash

23
00:00:59.866 --> 00:01:02.300
Saying this kind of thing specifically to attract attention

24
00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.100
Look at Zuo Ying's poor appearance

25
00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.966
I can't even wear a tuxedo

26
00:01:06.966 --> 00:01:08.966
Why do you have the face to stay here?

27
00:01:09.066 --> 00:01:12.866
The style on you should be from a few years ago, right?

28
00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:14.400
This is a high-end model.

29
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.466
Can you afford it? Why are you here?

30
00:01:18.466 --> 00:01:19.266
Humph

31
00:01:20.166 --> 00:01:22.300
A virgin who was expelled from her home

32
00:01:22.666 --> 00:01:23.866
Come here.

33
00:01:23.966 --> 00:01:26.666
I'm afraid there are no hidden ideas, right?

34
00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.500
Oh, by the way, I heard that the big money you are dating

35
00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.166
It's a 60-year-old baby

36
00:01:32.266 --> 00:01:35.800
Hahaha, why are you here looking for new prey?

37
00:01:36.366 --> 00:01:37.233
left tone

38
00:01:37.766 --> 00:01:40.833
Get out if you know better

39
00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:43.400
You deserve to be here

40
00:01:43.533 --> 00:01:46.066
You are not afraid of getting old Liu's eyes dirty

41
00:01:46.366 --> 00:01:49.233
Whether I'm worthy or not has nothing to do with your left-handed

42
00:01:50.533 --> 00:01:53.466
You don't deserve it or not.

43
00:01:54.266 --> 00:01:56.500
Which wild man's invitation is it rubbing against?

44
00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:57.566
Come in

45
00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.833
You'll be so blind

46
00:02:01.133 --> 00:02:04.066
You still have the same mouth full of shit

47
00:02:04.066 --> 00:02:05.200
Pardon me?

48
00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.600
You're just spraying shit
