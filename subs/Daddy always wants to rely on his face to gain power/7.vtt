1
00:00:11.066 --> 00:00:11.966
Xiaorui is not dead yet

2
00:00:11.966 --> 00:00:12.900
He can still be saved

3
00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.000
Madam please calm down

4
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.666
Let the deceased rest in peace

5
00:00:17.166 --> 00:00:17.966
Don't you know?

6
00:00:17.966 --> 00:00:19.966
Is death to be argued from multiple angles?

7
00:00:20.066 --> 00:00:21.766
You conclude that he is dead

8
00:00:21.766 --> 00:00:23.400
This is your dereliction of duty as a doctor

9
00:00:23.666 --> 00:00:25.066
You're not a doctor

10
00:00:25.066 --> 00:00:26.433
What do you know?

11
00:00:26.666 --> 00:00:29.666
The new store monitor has stopped beating

12
00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.266
Is this all the doctors in the hospital know?

13
00:00:32.466 --> 00:00:34.266
This is the best marriage in Sioux City

14
00:00:34.333 --> 00:00:35.766
He has a faint pulsation

15
00:00:35.766 --> 00:00:36.800
This is a false death.

16
00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.400
Funny I've been in business for 15 years

17
00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:42.800
I've done more than 1,000 surgeries, large and small.

18
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.500
Do you know medicine or do I?

19
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.000
Your judgment has no effect on me

20
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.133
I've done hundreds of surgeries with Dr. Wang

21
00:00:50.133 --> 00:00:52.100
What are you questioning Dr. Wang?

22
00:00:52.166 --> 00:00:54.200
He is the surgical authority at our hospital

23
00:00:54.266 --> 00:00:55.566
Are you qualified?

24
00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.600
The Thank You Letters Our Doctors Receive Every Year

25
00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.100
I don't know how many pennants there are

26
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.166
Bleeding to death in front of our Dr. Wang

27
00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:02.466
How ignorant is that?

28
00:01:02.466 --> 00:01:04.666
What is your status here?

29
00:01:04.733 --> 00:01:06.166
Even if he had a pulse

30
00:01:06.266 --> 00:01:08.966
The king of heaven can't save him even when he comes

31
00:01:08.966 --> 00:01:11.766
I'm talking about being a doctor.

32
00:01:11.766 --> 00:01:14.400
Even if there is a glimmer of hope, it should not be given up

33
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.700
Put up or shut up.

34
00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:18.366
You can't shut your mouth

35
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.400
Prepare the patient for CPR immediately

36
00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:34.666
Are you kidding me?

37
00:01:34.766 --> 00:01:35.933
Is this woman crazy?

38
00:01:35.933 --> 00:01:37.966
A Wei Hao really plans to perform the surgery by himself

39
00:01:37.966 --> 00:01:38.866
Cheng shut up

40
00:01:40.066 --> 00:01:40.866
It's still here.

41
00:01:40.933 --> 00:01:42.866
Oh oh good scalpel

42
00:01:43.266 --> 00:01:45.300
Ma'am, the surgery failed.

43
00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:47.100
I can understand how you feel now.

44
00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.533
But an ordinary surgery

45
00:01:48.533 --> 00:01:51.266
He also needs to have extensive practical experience and preparation

46
00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.333
Not to mention this complicated surgery

47
00:01:53.333 --> 00:01:55.266
You have no experience in operating on children

48
00:01:55.266 --> 00:01:57.400
This will only make him more miserable

49
00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.966
Xiao Rui needs surgery now

50
00:02:00.066 --> 00:02:01.333
I will take responsibility for my actions.

51
00:02:01.333 --> 00:02:02.866
I need you as my assistant now

52
00:02:02.866 --> 00:02:04.700
Can you cooperate with me to complete the surgery?

53
00:02:09.066 --> 00:02:10.866
You are
