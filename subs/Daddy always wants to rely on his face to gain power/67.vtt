00:00:02.766 --> 00:00:03.766
Ah!

2
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:07.966
I didn't want to argue with you

3
00:00:08.533 --> 00:00:09.933
You have to provoke me

4
00:00:09.933 --> 00:00:11.166
Don't blame me for being rude

5
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.000
Uh-huh.

6
00:00:13.333 --> 00:00:15.066
What are you two fighting about?

7
00:00:15.066 --> 00:00:16.266
Run him over

8
00:00:19.566 --> 00:00:21.300
He is such a piece of crap.

9
00:00:21.533 --> 00:00:23.433
You can't do it well.

10
00:00:23.566 --> 00:00:24.366
left and right

11
00:00:24.866 --> 00:00:26.766
You're quite imposing, aren't you?

12
00:00:28.566 --> 00:00:29.766
Look who this is.

13
00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:31.966
Xiaorui Xiaorui

14
00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:34.000
Who is it?

15
00:00:34.566 --> 00:00:36.800
Ah look I forgot

16
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:38.866
It's the first time you've seen me

17
00:00:39.133 --> 00:00:39.900
My husband.

18
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:41.500
Because you divorced me

19
00:00:42.066 --> 00:00:43.133
I stand in front of you now

20
00:00:43.133 --> 00:00:44.666
You don't even know who I am

21
00:00:45.266 --> 00:00:46.833
That's Forestry's ex-wife.

22
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.700
You just scrapped the Dream City one.

23
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
So it makes sense that I shaved his face now

24
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.700
He's your kid.

25
00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:59.000
Some children also deserve this little wild breed

26
00:00:59.666 --> 00:01:00.766
Don't go stop

27
00:01:00.766 --> 00:01:02.033
No children.

28
00:01:02.766 --> 00:01:04.733
Mom mom

29
00:01:04.733 --> 00:01:07.500
The villain is really a little wild

30
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.100
I can't keep it

31
00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.200
Even if he is not your biological son

32
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.566
So you've been together for so long?

33
00:01:13.566 --> 00:01:15.566
Don't you have any feelings at all?

34
00:01:16.266 --> 00:01:18.400
He's your son of a bitch

35
00:01:18.733 --> 00:01:21.066
What feelings could I have for him?
