kid

3
00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:09.200
To worship a teacher, you must find someone more powerful than yourself to worship a teacher

4
00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:12.366
So that you can learn more knowledge

5
00:00:12.366 --> 00:00:14.166
Come and I will worship you as my teacher

00:00:14.733 --> 00:00:16.233

00:00:19.066 --> 00:00:22.066

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.100
Oh, my God.

11
00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.300

12
00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.566
A child of several years old will diagnose love

13
00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.700

17
00:00:46.866 --> 00:00:49.800
He's too sick to move on his own.

18
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.033
I've tried many things, but I can't help it.

19
00:00:53.566 --> 00:00:56.866
I want to ask you to treat the disease?

20
00:00:56.866 --> 00:00:59.666
Of course, you can pay as you like

21
00:00:59.766 --> 00:01:02.433

22
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:03.833

23
00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:05.600

24
00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:09.200

25
00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.033
Brother, yes, several brothers.

26
00:01:14.133 --> 00:01:16.100
Fine. I'll be there tomorrow.

27
00:01:16.166 --> 00:01:18.200
Oh, thank you, master

28
00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.600

30
00:01:35.266 --> 00:01:36.700
Mom?

00:01:37.466 --> 00:01:38.500
aunt

32
00:01:39.066 --> 00:01:40.700
You put it away
