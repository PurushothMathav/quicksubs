00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:00.766
elder brother

2
00:00:00.766 --> 00:00:04.766
It is good for your body to take one tablet a day.

3
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.733
As long as you are not feeling well

4
00:00:06.733 --> 00:00:08.733
Or breathing difficulties

5
00:00:08.733 --> 00:00:10.266
Just take 3

6
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:15.166
You can't take medicine indiscriminately, you know?

7
00:00:15.166 --> 00:00:17.700
If you don't prescribe the right medicine, it may be more serious

8
00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:20.200
Uncle, please call me Daming.

9
00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:23.066
Only those closest to me can call me Xiao Ming

10
00:00:23.533 --> 00:00:25.500
Is that right?

11
00:00:25.533 --> 00:00:28.700
Who hugged my thigh and called me daddy two days ago

12
00:00:29.133 --> 00:00:30.366
I'm a kid

13
00:00:30.366 --> 00:00:33.633
It's normal to do something weird wrong.

14
00:00:33.733 --> 00:00:36.466
Well, when your mother comes

15
00:00:36.533 --> 00:00:38.100
I have to talk to him

16
00:00:38.333 --> 00:00:39.766
Let him discipline you

17
00:00:39.766 --> 00:00:42.033
Stop doing weird things

18
00:00:43.066 --> 00:00:45.900
Mr. Lin, what are you saying?

19
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:48.100
Please don't tell my mommy

20
00:00:48.133 --> 00:00:50.900
Otherwise he will definitely smash my ass

21
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:54.600
Mom?

22
00:00:55.733 --> 00:00:57.666
When I got lost in the dormitory two days ago

23
00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.233
I'm in a hurry.

24
00:00:59.466 --> 00:01:00.833
Are you worried about her?

25
00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.866
But have you ever thought about running out on your own?

26
00:01:03.866 --> 00:01:05.300
Your mom doesn't know where you're going.

27
00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:06.800
How worried should I be?

28
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.866
Dad will worry about me

29
00:01:09.133 --> 00:01:11.433
Is this what it feels like to have a dad?

30
00:01:21.866 --> 00:01:23.100
Xiao Rui misses me

31
00:01:26.666 --> 00:01:29.466
Does the left eagle's hand have any magic power?
