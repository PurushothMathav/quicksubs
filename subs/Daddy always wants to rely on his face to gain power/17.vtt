00:00:00.733 --> 00:00:02.966
Hey retail kids

2
00:00:03.566 --> 00:00:05.166
Not that change

3
00:00:06.166 --> 00:00:08.466
Mr. Liu, I'm really sorry.

4
00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:11.400
He's not a doctor at our hospital.

5
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:12.700
I can't be the master.

6
00:00:12.733 --> 00:00:15.400
Can you tell me about this old man?

7
00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:16.866
What is his identity

8
00:00:17.266 --> 00:00:19.100
I'd like to meet him.

9
00:00:19.133 --> 00:00:20.166
This one.

10
00:00:20.466 --> 00:00:24.633
I can't reveal the master's information privately, otherwise

11
00:00:24.933 --> 00:00:26.766
I'll ask what he means.

12
00:00:26.766 --> 00:00:28.100
Then reply to you.

13
00:00:28.366 --> 00:00:29.266
3 days later

14
00:00:29.266 --> 00:00:32.133
I held an art fair in Sioux City

15
00:00:32.133 --> 00:00:35.166
I hope you can exchange art together

16
00:00:35.166 --> 00:00:36.400
Raise Together

17
00:00:37.866 --> 00:00:38.966
These three invitations

18
00:00:39.466 --> 00:00:41.066
It's for our hospital.

19
00:00:42.366 --> 00:00:43.966
Please check this tissue

20
00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.000
Ask the dean to hand it over to the master

21
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.866
Can you come and guide us then?

22
00:00:55.533 --> 00:00:56.900
I made it.

23
00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:59.200
I never dreamed that one day

24
00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.100
The dignified Sacred Hands in National Clothes

25
00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.633
Will talk to me so politely

26
00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.600
The surgical skills of this master

27
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.900
I'm afraid there are only exotic ones in the world

28
00:01:11.366 --> 00:01:12.566
Phantom Doctor

29
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.366
To compare with

30
00:01:14.666 --> 00:01:17.000
They both lead the world.

31
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.200
Masters in Medicine Moving Forward

32
00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.600
Lin Shao, please be sure to find this master

33
00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.500
This person is in China

34
00:01:25.533 --> 00:01:27.966
It's an honor for my country.

35
00:01:28.066 --> 00:01:30.833
This master's surgical approach

36
00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:32.366
Amazing

37
00:01:32.366 --> 00:01:34.066
You have benefited me a lot.

38
00:01:34.066 --> 00:01:37.800
I have to go back quickly and digest and study well

39
00:01:37.933 --> 00:01:39.366
Ok, I'll send it to you.

40
00:01:46.466 --> 00:01:46.766
jing rui

41
00:01:46.766 --> 00:01:49.166
This kid said earlier that he has no interest in communicating on weekdays

42
00:01:49.166 --> 00:01:50.133
I didn't expect that one day

43
00:01:50.133 --> 00:01:52.200
I can see this happiness in his face

44
00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.633
Satisfied expression

45
00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.766
The villain is so cute

46
00:01:59.266 --> 00:02:00.066
Mom

47
00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.466
Mom
