00:00:02.566 --> 00:00:05.266
Don't you know Haotian, the world's top hacker?

2
00:00:05.266 --> 00:00:06.400
How can I find my father?

3
00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.366
I've been looking for a year and can't find it.

4
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.333
Is it useless for the president's ancestors?

5
00:00:10.333 --> 00:00:11.400
How dare I not use the president

6
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:12.666
My life is still in your hands

7
00:00:12.666 --> 00:00:13.666
Waiting for your treatment

8
00:00:13.666 --> 00:00:15.100
I'll send you a photo of him right away.

9
00:00:30.733 --> 00:00:34.633
Mom Mom Mom

10
00:00:42.133 --> 00:00:43.500
Full of congenital deficiencies

11
00:00:43.566 --> 00:00:46.100
I'm afraid it was inherited from his biological father

12
00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:47.333
If it weren't for me all these years

13
00:00:47.333 --> 00:00:48.900
Inseparable care

14
00:00:49.133 --> 00:00:52.433
I'm afraid his body won't be able to hold up when he's three years old

15
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.100
You have a good rest here

16
00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.366
Mom is going out to buy you something to eat?

17
00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.566
Friend star kid

18
00:01:11.266 --> 00:01:13.000
Why is this child so frail?

19
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.600
Extroverted chaos doesn't seem to live long

20
00:01:24.966 --> 00:01:28.166
Hey, I don't have eyes.

21
00:01:28.166 --> 00:01:32.000
This is not the eldest lady Zuo who was kicked out of the Zuo family

22
00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.366
Not dead yet

23
00:01:36.866 --> 00:01:38.500
It seems that you left the left house

24
00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.400
It's really nothing

25
00:01:40.566 --> 00:01:42.800
I'm actually down and delivering takeout

26
00:01:42.966 --> 00:01:46.700
And you're still alive with your bastard son

27
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.033
The model on you should be out of season from a few years ago.

28
00:01:54.566 --> 00:01:56.300
It seems that the left family is not doing well

29
00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:58.600
I won't go back and add to the burden

30
00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.033
You, Xuan Xuan

31
00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:02.966
Downloaders like him

32
00:02:03.333 --> 00:02:04.400
What to care about

33
00:02:04.466 --> 00:02:08.033
Gigi, why don't I be a good person?

34
00:02:08.066 --> 00:02:10.266
Double the price for your takeout

35
00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.633
Yeah, 400,000

36
00:02:13.666 --> 00:02:15.100
Thank you for your kindness, sister.

37
00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:16.566
You are crazy about money.

38
00:02:16.566 --> 00:02:18.566
200,000 takeout, you can really blow

39
00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.100
This is the Xiaoqinglou Hotel on the second floor.

40
00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:23.366
Share 3 copies a day

41
00:02:23.366 --> 00:02:25.000
But this dish is 80,000 bucks

42
00:02:26.533 --> 00:02:28.066
And steamed frog fish

43
00:02:28.066 --> 00:02:29.600
Need goose well vine paste

44
00:02:30.666 --> 00:02:33.366
This is the exclusive dish of the restaurant's premium VIP

45
00:02:33.366 --> 00:02:34.366
Oh, right.

46
00:02:34.366 --> 00:02:36.900
It's not impossible to feed your dog

47
00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:37.700
you

48
00:02:38.266 --> 00:02:39.100
Ah!

49
00:02:39.733 --> 00:02:40.600
You Chen Fei

50
00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.866
I haven't found it yet. There are few projects for Xiao Ren.

51
00:02:44.866 --> 00:02:46.700
I searched all over Kyoto and there was no one

52
00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:47.900
Shuai, don't rest.

53
00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.100
What do you eat?

54
00:02:50.133 --> 00:02:52.366
Won't you go to other provinces to check if you don't have it in Kyoto?

55
00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.266
Keep looking and don't come back to me if you can't find it

56
00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:04.466
Li Li Shao

57
00:03:05.666 --> 00:03:07.900
Master let you go home
