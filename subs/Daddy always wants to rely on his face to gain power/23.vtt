00:00:03.566 --> 00:00:04.133
Miss Zuo

2
00:00:04.133 --> 00:00:06.600
More beautiful and generous than the rumors

3
00:00:07.166 --> 00:00:07.866
Yes!

4
00:00:07.866 --> 00:00:10.900
Miss Zuo is really the most outstanding among the wealthy families in Sioucheng

5
00:00:10.933 --> 00:00:14.000
No wonder even Mr. Liu likes him so much

6
00:00:14.333 --> 00:00:16.400
You were joking.

7
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:20.000
Thanks to meeting Mr. Liu that day

8
00:00:20.066 --> 00:00:24.400
If only this group of people could hold me like this before

9
00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.066
Angelica cinnamon branch

10
00:00:30.733 --> 00:00:33.200
Deerslayer licorice

11
00:00:34.133 --> 00:00:35.666
What other medicine is there?

12
00:00:36.766 --> 00:00:39.233
Burnt snake hey yes yes yes

13
00:00:39.733 --> 00:00:42.300
Why didn't I think of that?

14
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:43.200
Xiaoyong

15
00:00:43.566 --> 00:00:46.666
You seem to have studied medicine as well.

16
00:00:46.666 --> 00:00:48.466
Isn't this the Holy Hand of Chinese Medicine?

17
00:00:48.966 --> 00:00:51.066
If you can catch up with him

18
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.066
A little bit

19
00:00:54.066 --> 00:00:55.800
Our family makes medical equipment

20
00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.100
Immersed from an early age

21
00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:58.666
This is an ancient recipe

22
00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:00.100
Those who know

23
00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:01.166
So a couple.

24
00:01:01.733 --> 00:01:03.066
Can you know

25
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.566
It means that your family has also received the inheritance of ancient medicine

26
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.366
Hey, can I meet your family?

27
00:01:12.466 --> 00:01:13.566
Certainly!

28
00:01:13.733 --> 00:01:15.333
I remember the ancient recipe

29
00:01:15.333 --> 00:01:17.966
It was in a book I read at home when I was a kid

30
00:01:17.966 --> 00:01:20.966
I've turned my house upside down in the past two days

31
00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:22.833
Can't find that book

32
00:01:22.966 --> 00:01:24.100
compared to

33
00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.766
Miss Zuo's sister is not up to expectations

34
00:01:26.766 --> 00:01:29.766
Pregnancy out of wedlock is completely off the table

35
00:01:29.766 --> 00:01:32.500
Fortunately, he was expelled from the left house

36
00:01:33.566 --> 00:01:35.000
You said this

37
00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.066
I met my sister at the welcome restaurant two days ago

38
00:01:38.066 --> 00:01:40.633
Yeah, and he ordered 200,000 takeout

39
00:01:40.733 --> 00:01:41.700
I thought

40
00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.466
My sister is indeed the eldest daughter of our Zuo family

41
00:01:44.533 --> 00:01:47.266
You can also thrive away from home

42
00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:48.866
result

43
00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.066
I didn't expect it a few days ago.

44
00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.666
He was actually holding an old man in his 60s and 70s

45
00:01:55.666 --> 00:01:56.466
Ah!

46
00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.366
So shameless

47
00:01:59.366 --> 00:02:03.100
Hey, you didn't say you wouldn't be a mistress, did you?

48
00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:03.800
Back in the day

49
00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.900
He can cuckold his fiancÃ©

50
00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:09.633
It's not surprising to be a lover for an old man
