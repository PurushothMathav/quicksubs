00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:01.333
Do you know?

2
00:00:01.333 --> 00:00:04.900
He was quick and mean and said how handsome he was when he shut up

3
00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:08.266
That momentum directly stunned everyone present

4
00:00:08.266 --> 00:00:10.566
I didn't know his identity at the time

5
00:00:10.566 --> 00:00:14.433
I have already heard his words by the ghost axe god

6
00:00:14.533 --> 00:00:16.500
Have you seen China Little Master?

7
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.700
His scalpel

8
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.300
It makes it as fast as the special effects of that cartoon

9
00:00:21.333 --> 00:00:24.133
Well, I couldn't help but see straight.

10
00:00:24.133 --> 00:00:26.166
I was so excited that I almost let out a cock crow

11
00:00:26.166 --> 00:00:27.300
Awesome, awesome

12
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.066
Then Jing Rui would laugh

13
00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.000
You can still laugh so happily

14
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.466
Ah sir please go out

15
00:00:37.466 --> 00:00:38.766
This is a private room

16
00:00:38.766 --> 00:00:40.233
Outsiders are not allowed in

17
00:00:42.066 --> 00:00:43.233
I am his father

18
00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.000
Ah hello hello hello Mr. Li Qi

19
00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:50.766
Then I won't bother you two

20
00:00:50.766 --> 00:00:52.300
I'll go out first

21
00:00:52.733 --> 00:00:55.600
Oh yes sir you are so happy

22
00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.600
To have such a powerful wife

23
00:00:59.466 --> 00:01:01.000
He knew Qi Jingning

24
00:01:02.466 --> 00:01:03.400
Lin Jingrui

25
00:01:04.333 --> 00:01:05.666
Why did you run away from home?

26
00:01:06.133 --> 00:01:07.066
Missing for so many days

27
00:01:07.066 --> 00:01:08.533
Why don't you know to make a phone call?

28
00:01:08.533 --> 00:01:10.033
That's what I taught you.

29
00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.400
You can have another one with that woman

30
00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.566
I'm about to die, Lin Jingrui

31
00:01:15.966 --> 00:01:17.833
Who wears you and talks like that?

32
00:01:19.066 --> 00:01:20.366
As long as I am in one day

33
00:01:21.133 --> 00:01:23.033
You have to give me a good life

34
00:01:23.466 --> 00:01:25.500
Living is really tiring

35
00:01:31.166 --> 00:01:31.966
Xiao Rui

36
00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.366
Just be stronger, okay?

37
00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.100
I've done my best.

38
00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:38.500
Give you all the best things

39
00:01:38.966 --> 00:01:39.733
This world

40
00:01:39.733 --> 00:01:41.833
There are still so many children without all

41
00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:44.066
They are all trying to live

42
00:01:45.066 --> 00:01:47.100
I'm not tired many times.

43
00:01:47.333 --> 00:01:49.800
You have no idea what I want

44
00:01:49.866 --> 00:01:51.166
But dad will be relieved
