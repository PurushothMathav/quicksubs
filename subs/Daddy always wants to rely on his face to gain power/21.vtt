00:00:00.533 --> 00:00:02.900
Mommy, you want to be with scum

2
00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:06.500
Replace the old love and rekindle it?

3
00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:07.300
OK

4
00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:09.466
suppose

5
00:00:09.466 --> 00:00:13.100
I said, what if he's a scum?

6
00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:16.700
He didn't leave you to do a mission either.

7
00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:25.900
What kind of person is Mommy?

8
00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:27.600
So how did you meet?

9
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:28.866
Beat me up

10
00:00:29.966 --> 00:00:34.066
It was a dark and windy night

11
00:00:34.333 --> 00:00:36.200
I was thrown out of my house.

12
00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.666
Met a bad guy

13
00:00:37.666 --> 00:00:39.266
He fell from the sky

14
00:00:39.266 --> 00:00:40.966
Save me like a hero

15
00:00:42.566 --> 00:00:44.800
Know each other and love each other

16
00:00:44.866 --> 00:00:46.233
I gave birth to you.

17
00:00:46.866 --> 00:00:49.066
But he's going on a secret mission

18
00:00:49.066 --> 00:00:51.466
Have to work with us

19
00:00:54.466 --> 00:00:57.300
It's over. I was watching the overbearing officer case

20
00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.466
I'm so fascinated

21
00:00:58.466 --> 00:00:59.833
Brought in the heroine

22
00:00:59.966 --> 00:01:02.033
Full of it has always been remembered in my heart

23
00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.533
Mom Zebra forgot to tell you

24
00:01:07.533 --> 00:01:08.600
Where's your Daddy?

25
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.400
Worked in the secret service

26
00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.166
When mommy fell in love with him

27
00:01:12.166 --> 00:01:15.066
He's using a fake identity and a fake face

28
00:01:15.066 --> 00:01:16.966
So Mommy doesn't know what he looks like.

29
00:01:16.966 --> 00:01:18.700
But he made a pact with Mommy

30
00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:20.933
He'll come back to us when he's done

31
00:01:20.933 --> 00:01:24.433
Mommy, do you think I'm so gullible as a 3-year-old child?

32
00:01:25.266 --> 00:01:27.400
We can't let Manman know how he got here

33
00:01:28.133 --> 00:01:30.700
When did Mommy ever lie to you?

34
00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.733
Yeah, Mommy, yeah.

35
00:01:33.733 --> 00:01:35.200
Then he came to see you today

36
00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.300
Can I tell you how he gets along with these people?

37
00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:39.666
When did he come to see me?

38
00:01:39.666 --> 00:01:41.700
You still want to cut your thigh today

39
00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.133
You said forestry?

40
00:01:43.133 --> 00:01:44.600
He's not your daddy

41
00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.533
Didn't I save a child some time ago?

42
00:01:46.533 --> 00:01:48.066
He is the father of that little child.

43
00:01:48.066 --> 00:01:50.000
Daddy didn't recognize Mommy

44
00:01:50.066 --> 00:01:52.300
You've got to fire them.

45
00:01:52.466 --> 00:01:56.100
Wait, when am I going to kiss him on the mouth?

46
00:01:56.166 --> 00:01:59.066
I'm beautiful, you need to be beaten again, right? Don't run away.
