It all hurts

5
00:00:07.733 --> 00:00:09.666
Emma was born in Ronaldo 5 years ago

6
00:00:09.666 --> 00:00:10.366
First shot

7
00:00:10.366 --> 00:00:10.900
Just cure

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:12.966
Cases judged incurable internationally

9
00:00:12.966 --> 00:00:14.366
This is the first case to be cured

10
00:00:14.366 --> 00:00:16.400
Debut is the peak that people look up to

11
00:00:16.466 --> 00:00:17.300

Published countless papers

14
00:00:20.066 --> 00:00:21.666
To know that you can pass this exam

15
00:00:21.666 --> 00:00:22.500
Blame this paper

16
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.000
It's already a top track

That is the world's

20
00:00:28.966 --> 00:00:30.566
Artists are scolded as if they were gods

21
00:00:30.566 --> 00:00:32.066
It turned out to be from our country

22
00:00:32.066 --> 00:00:34.166
Could it be just a coincidence?

23
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.500
They are just the same age and surname

24
00:00:37.333 --> 00:00:38.700
Are you stupid?

25
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.066
In his miraculous way

26
00:00:41.066 --> 00:00:43.366
Isn't it enough for us to look up?

27
00:00:43.366 --> 00:00:44.666
That Dr. Wang

28
00:00:44.666 --> 00:00:47.066
We were just taunting him

29
00:00:54.933 --> 00:00:58.900
I was rude to Emma just now

30
00:01:04.466 --> 00:01:08.366
What do you mean, Phantom Medicine has come to our hospital in person?

31
00:01:08.466 --> 00:01:10.233
You're disrespectful to him

32
00:01:10.266 --> 00:01:13.100
Dean, I really got into trouble this time

33
00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:14.666
What to do now

34
00:01:16.533 --> 00:01:20.366
We have a saying together, it is better to provoke the king of hell than to provoke and be scolded

35
00:01:20.366 --> 00:01:21.633
Don't you know?

36
00:01:22.166 --> 00:01:26.200
Let's not talk about the fans who take the scolded to the sky

37
00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.866
Just those dignitaries who were scolded and rescued

38
00:01:29.933 --> 00:01:31.100
Just enough for you to drink once

39
00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:32.900
Willing to save me quickly

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:34.600

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:37.700
This

42
00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.266
Explain to those brats who know the situation day by day

43
00:01:40.266 --> 00:01:42.366
Make sure to keep Emma's identity a secret

44
00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.766
Wei Guo has encrypted his files

45
00:01:45.766 --> 00:01:48.133
If we know Emma's true identity

46
00:01:48.133 --> 00:01:51.600
Hmph, our hospital checked my hospital.

47
00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.000
Yes wait

48
00:01:53.533 --> 00:01:55.200
I'm going to prepare some generous gifts

49
00:01:55.333 --> 00:01:58.500
Apologize in person with you
