1
00:00:17.066 --> 00:00:19.233
So you gave birth to a stillborn child.

2
00:00:52.333 --> 00:00:55.900
Ah bitch a shameless thing

3
00:00:56.066 --> 00:00:57.200
Have a fiancÃ©

4
00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.500
Are you still fooling around with other men?

5
00:00:59.566 --> 00:01:01.600
How could I possibly fool around with other men?

6
00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.333
It was Han Chen who met me here yesterday

7
00:01:04.333 --> 00:01:07.233
Sister, what nonsense are you talking about?

8
00:01:07.266 --> 00:01:08.366
Last night?

9
00:01:08.366 --> 00:01:11.400
Brother Hanchen has been waiting for you all night at the writer

10
00:01:14.766 --> 00:01:15.566
i

11
00:01:16.933 --> 00:01:17.866
Not hate you

12
00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.533
You're a fiasco now

13
00:01:21.533 --> 00:01:23.166
Not worthy of marrying into the Mo family

14
00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.566
Your marriage to Mo Hanquan is over

15
00:01:27.933 --> 00:01:29.366
He won't agree

16
00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:36.066
Oh my good sister

17
00:01:36.366 --> 00:01:38.166
You don't know yet

18
00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.166
I was already Han Chengge's person last night

19
00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.266
You really don't love me

20
00:01:52.333 --> 00:01:53.900
He wouldn't do that to me.

21
00:01:53.933 --> 00:01:55.566
How many more questions do I have to ask?

22
00:01:55.766 --> 00:01:58.533
Mr. Chen Douyin that little girl last night

23
00:01:58.533 --> 00:02:00.000
Are you satisfied with it?

24
00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:01.000
You see

25
00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.566
Is this contract a hatred that has been advocated before?

26
00:02:09.166 --> 00:02:10.466
Hey Mr. Chen

27
00:02:12.733 --> 00:02:14.466
Are you kidding me like this?

28
00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.966
I waited in my room all night and didn't see you

29
00:02:16.966 --> 00:02:18.033
This little girl

30
00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:21.033
I've been on fire all night and I've been unloaded

31
00:02:25.933 --> 00:02:27.166
You tell me.

32
00:02:27.533 --> 00:02:29.833
None of this is true.

33
00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:32.066
Mr. Chen Mr. Chen

34
00:02:32.866 --> 00:02:34.500
Aren't you here, little girl?

35
00:02:34.533 --> 00:02:36.300
Now it's just the two of us.

36
00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.066
You can do whatever you want.

37
00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.633
Ahahahaha

38
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.166
What's wrong hahaha

39
00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.433
He was the one who ruined my takeover that night

40
00:03:04.666 --> 00:03:05.766
Yes ma'am

41
00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:07.066
A Little Sioux City

42
00:03:07.066 --> 00:03:09.566
A woman who breaks a door can also be contaminated with spirit beasts

43
00:03:14.933 --> 00:03:16.766
Robbed this bitch's child

44
00:03:17.266 --> 00:03:18.900
He can't get in the door

45
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.133
This is 5 million

46
00:03:20.133 --> 00:03:21.066
Shut your mouth

47
00:03:21.066 --> 00:03:22.666
Otherwise I hide

48
00:03:26.133 --> 00:03:26.700
Ning Shao

49
00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.000
The innocence of my police academy has been destroyed by you

50
00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.600
Even the child was born

51
00:03:35.133 --> 00:03:35.933
Really?

52
00:03:36.466 --> 00:03:38.066
Why didn't I know this happened?

53
00:03:38.466 --> 00:03:39.966
Tingting, come on

54
00:03:41.066 --> 00:03:41.900
Lin Shao

55
00:03:41.933 --> 00:03:45.500
Have you forgotten that night in Sioux City ten months ago?

56
00:03:46.166 --> 00:03:47.066
Sioux City

57
00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.466
Another stomach-churning woman

58
00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.600
Go check who placed it.

59
00:03:57.066 --> 00:03:58.633
I haven't congratulated our Young Master Ling yet.

60
00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:01.433
Finally got rid of virginity

61
00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:03.900
If you don't believe me

62
00:04:04.266 --> 00:04:05.833
You can look at the paternity test.

63
00:04:10.966 --> 00:04:11.766
You say

64
00:04:12.366 --> 00:04:13.566
This is your baby.

65
00:04:16.066 --> 00:04:18.500
Kicked out of the house by his biological father

66
00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:20.466
Humiliated and tortured by her fiancÃ©

67
00:04:20.466 --> 00:04:24.666
Maybe my presence was a mistake from the beginning

68
00:04:24.933 --> 00:04:27.900
It won't be so painful to die, right?

69
00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:33.266
Maybe that's fine

70
00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:37.200
Free when you die

71
00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:39.833
This is the woman who sabotaged the eldest lady's plan

72
00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.633
Is there still a child in my attached school alive?

73
00:04:43.766 --> 00:04:44.833
I can't die.

74
00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:01.066
Mommy, are we back for Daddy?

75
00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:05.400
Yeah it's back to Daddy yeah yeah yeah
