00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:10.300
Zuo Jinxiu, your wings are really hard, right?

2
00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:13.900
Mommy, beautiful mommy, I was wrong.

3
00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:15.766
I'll tell you secretly.

4
00:00:15.766 --> 00:00:17.833
I'm on a big deal

5
00:00:17.966 --> 00:00:19.100
So what's up?

6
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.633
I'll tell you later.

7
00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:24.966
Mommy, why do you look so tired?

8
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.400
Just had surgery

9
00:00:27.766 --> 00:00:30.300
Mom, hurry up and rest.

10
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.100
I have a big surprise for you after a while

11
00:00:33.333 --> 00:00:36.466
Um, bye, mommy.

12
00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.033
Great grandfather

13
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:46.266
This little sapling looks so fragile

14
00:00:46.266 --> 00:00:48.166
Can we feed them?

15
00:00:48.166 --> 00:00:49.400
This one.

16
00:00:49.566 --> 00:00:53.200
It was planted by great-grandfather and grandson together

17
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:57.266
He is like this little sapling

18
00:00:57.566 --> 00:00:59.566
Fragile and fragile

19
00:01:00.133 --> 00:01:04.566
But he is the baby that our family takes care of.

20
00:01:05.266 --> 00:01:08.966
Is Sun Sun the child of Dad's cousin?

21
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.100
The son of an aunt and his wife

22
00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.666
Wife dad has wife

23
00:01:15.666 --> 00:01:17.300
And other sons

24
00:01:17.566 --> 00:01:18.866
little guy

25
00:01:19.066 --> 00:01:22.233
Do you really want your aunt to be your father?

26
00:01:22.266 --> 00:01:23.766
Then mom agrees

27
00:01:26.066 --> 00:01:27.066
Answer one

28
00:01:27.166 --> 00:01:30.600
Send me information on my father's wife and son

29
00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.000
He is still a month older than me

30
00:01:34.766 --> 00:01:36.300
Dad is scum

31
00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:37.566
No, he's not Dad.

32
00:01:37.566 --> 00:01:38.666
He is scum

33
00:01:38.666 --> 00:01:41.966
Mommy must have been tricked into giving birth to me by him

34
00:01:41.966 --> 00:01:44.600
I didn't know scum already had a wife

35
00:01:46.166 --> 00:01:46.933
Grandpa

36
00:01:46.933 --> 00:01:48.866
The people under me have never found Jing Rui

37
00:01:48.866 --> 00:01:50.366
I'm very anxious

38
00:01:50.566 --> 00:01:52.066
I want you to give Aye a call

39
00:01:52.066 --> 00:01:53.866
Ask if there is any news about Jing Rui.

40
00:01:54.166 --> 00:01:55.966
But he wouldn't answer a single phone call

41
00:01:56.533 --> 00:01:59.166
Oops, this kid has gone too far.

42
00:01:59.166 --> 00:01:59.966
Grandpa

43
00:02:00.333 --> 00:02:02.666
Recently, Brother Tang has been splurging

44
00:02:02.766 --> 00:02:05.300
There are small companies on the verge of bankruptcy

45
00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:06.533
He doesn't care at all

46
00:02:06.533 --> 00:02:07.900
The development of temporary assistance

47
00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:11.600
In the interim, it's all A Ye's decision

48
00:02:11.766 --> 00:02:12.966
Over the years

49
00:02:13.466 --> 00:02:16.300
The makeshift test strip doubled in his hand

50
00:02:16.866 --> 00:02:20.000
He must have had his own reasons for doing this

51
00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:21.366
Don't worry about it.

52
00:02:21.366 --> 00:02:23.633
But the shareholders' meeting had a problem with him

53
00:02:23.666 --> 00:02:25.866
Because he buys these small companies that are on the verge of bankruptcy

54
00:02:25.866 --> 00:02:27.666
The group lost 100 million in half a month

55
00:02:27.666 --> 00:02:30.300
Maybe Xiaoyue's disappearance made Auntie confused

56
00:02:30.566 --> 00:02:32.633
So I made the wrong decision

57
00:02:38.266 --> 00:02:41.266
Xiao Rui, this child doesn't know if he is too sensible.

58
00:02:41.266 --> 00:02:42.833
Never cause trouble to others

59
00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:44.900
It's just that I don't care what happens to the children

60
00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.233
He refuses to get close to me

61
00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.733
It's like being born without emotion.

62
00:02:48.733 --> 00:02:52.766
The two masters are more worry-free than the other

63
00:02:52.766 --> 00:02:55.333
Grandpa, come back and I'll talk about him

64
00:02:55.333 --> 00:02:57.966
Let him focus on his work

65
00:02:58.666 --> 00:03:00.300
Xiao Rui, this kid

66
00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.233
You need a lot of discipline
