00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:09.100
Hey welcome rain god

2
00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:10.233
Hello. Hello.

3
00:00:10.366 --> 00:00:11.366
Two days ago?

4
00:00:11.366 --> 00:00:15.200
Our hospital is really blind to Mount Tai, haha.

5
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:17.000
Oh how offensive

6
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.266
How offensive

7
00:00:18.533 --> 00:00:21.400
Today we are both coming to visit

8
00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:22.933
Mainly to apologize to you.

9
00:00:22.933 --> 00:00:25.900
I hope you can forgive me, haha.

10
00:00:25.966 --> 00:00:27.333
Sorry boss

11
00:00:27.333 --> 00:00:29.400
The day before yesterday, I was arrogant

12
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:30.700
Dogs look down on people

13
00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:33.166
Almost lost a life in vain

14
00:00:33.266 --> 00:00:35.600
Fortunately, it's your wonderful hand that rejuvenates

15
00:00:36.133 --> 00:00:37.933
I apologize for this today

16
00:00:37.933 --> 00:00:39.300
I hope you understand.

17
00:00:40.133 --> 00:00:41.500
Take back the gift.

18
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.166
It's not me you should apologize

19
00:00:43.166 --> 00:00:45.800
It's the patients you do your best to treat

20
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.100
Yes, yes, you said yes.

21
00:00:49.133 --> 00:00:52.200
Who would have thought that the child was the young master next door?

22
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.566
If Master Lin knew what I had done

23
00:00:54.566 --> 00:00:58.400
I'm afraid that ten lives are not enough to pay for it.

24
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:01.666
Don't be like that day again

25
00:01:01.666 --> 00:01:03.733
The patient has not been given up at the last moment

26
00:01:03.733 --> 00:01:07.000
As a doctor, you should respect life and cherish life

27
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.466
Are you teaching right?

28
00:01:08.533 --> 00:01:10.800
We must keep it in mind

29
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.000
Hey uh yesterday

30
00:01:13.533 --> 00:01:15.366
Liu Lao, the holy hand of Chinese medicine

31
00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.500
Entrust me to forward this invitation to you

32
00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.733
Uh, his old man's house is in the book city to hold a

33
00:01:22.733 --> 00:01:25.266
Medical Exchange Conference

34
00:01:25.266 --> 00:01:27.000
Just after 3 days

35
00:01:27.166 --> 00:01:29.066
I hope you can come then.

36
00:01:40.166 --> 00:01:42.633
As expected of a banquet held by the Chinese doctor

37
00:01:42.766 --> 00:01:43.700
In this hall?

38
00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:44.700
But all are flat

39
00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.466
Big names that can only be seen on TV

40
00:01:47.466 --> 00:01:50.700
Of course, the so-called top giants are all here

41
00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:51.500
And that

42
00:01:52.133 --> 00:01:54.466
We are multinational medical experts in different fields

43
00:01:54.766 --> 00:01:57.700
Invitations to this banquet are hard to come by

44
00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.700
That's right, my invitation

45
00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.866
Or my sister hooked up with that big shot

46
00:02:01.866 --> 00:02:03.066
Just one more

47
00:02:03.066 --> 00:02:04.633
So I can see.

48
00:02:04.733 --> 00:02:07.666
I heard that there are also the top purple and gold invitations

49
00:02:07.866 --> 00:02:09.966
I don't know how powerful the people who came

50
00:02:13.966 --> 00:02:15.233
Hey, Master Zuo

51
00:02:15.266 --> 00:02:16.266
I heard Mr. Liu

52
00:02:16.266 --> 00:02:18.066
After looking at your company's medical apparatus

53
00:02:18.066 --> 00:02:19.100
full of praise

54
00:02:19.133 --> 00:02:21.333
Your house is going to soar

55
00:02:21.333 --> 00:02:22.666
Where? Where?

56
00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:23.866
Right?

57
00:02:23.866 --> 00:02:26.500
Moreover, Mr. Liu also took a fancy to Miss Zuo's qualifications

58
00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:27.600
Do you want to take him as a disciple?

59
00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.600
Hey, it's all luck, it's luck, hahaha.

60
00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:32.800
Hey everyone
