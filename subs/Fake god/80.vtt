00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:03.066
Zhou Xiao, don't think you have the support of the temple

2
00:00:03.066 --> 00:00:04.766
You can do whatever you want

3
00:00:05.566 --> 00:00:09.166
Soon the temple will drown

4
00:00:09.333 --> 00:00:13.000
The king has decreed the destruction of your temple

5
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.400
The temple you rely on

6
00:00:15.733 --> 00:00:17.966
Under the might of the lord

7
00:00:18.333 --> 00:00:20.033
It's nothing.

8
00:00:20.333 --> 00:00:21.700
You're going too far.

9
00:00:22.066 --> 00:00:22.733
If the king

10
00:00:22.733 --> 00:00:24.533
Knowing that you are so cruel behind his back

11
00:00:24.533 --> 00:00:26.600
The temple will not let you go

12
00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.233
The king cannot possibly know and

13
00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:35.200
Even though he knew the temple had been reduced to ashes

14
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.200
He would pay for a temple that has disappeared

15
00:00:39.966 --> 00:00:41.900
Against us?

16
00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:42.766
Ah!

17
00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.766
What should we do?

18
00:00:46.333 --> 00:00:47.666
Justice will not be blinded
