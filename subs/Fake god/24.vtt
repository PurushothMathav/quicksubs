00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.566
It's not that you have the guts

2
00:00:01.566 --> 00:00:03.133
Do you know who you're talking to?

3
00:00:03.133 --> 00:00:05.866
Ah, hurry up and apologize to Mr. Feixiang

4
00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:07.566
apologize

5
00:00:08.133 --> 00:00:10.000
I'm afraid he can't take it

6
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.066
It's not that you are presumptuous

7
00:00:11.066 --> 00:00:13.133
Do you need me to apologize to you?

8
00:00:13.133 --> 00:00:14.566
This kid is screwed

9
00:00:14.566 --> 00:00:16.033
I have never seen it.

10
00:00:16.266 --> 00:00:18.000
Who dares to talk to the Flying General like that?

11
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.133
Just courting death

12
00:00:19.133 --> 00:00:20.066
Flying General

13
00:00:20.066 --> 00:00:21.200
Just a word from you

14
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:22.833
I'll find someone to take him down immediately

15
00:00:22.866 --> 00:00:24.533
You are teaching me to do things

16
00:00:24.533 --> 00:00:26.866
Hey, how dare I, Flying General?

17
00:00:32.066 --> 00:00:33.100
Greetings, Master

18
00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.500
The teacher has been apart for a year

19
00:00:36.666 --> 00:00:38.966
I have not yet repaid my teacher for his kindness

20
00:00:39.166 --> 00:00:42.166
I wouldn't be where I am today without you

21
00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.100
Lord Flying General and Lord God since childhood

22
00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:46.433
It's such a relationship

23
00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:48.766
Fortunately, the kid didn't fall behind

24
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.100
Get up yeah

25
00:00:53.866 --> 00:00:55.966
His temple lord

26
00:00:55.966 --> 00:00:57.533
Who are you waiting for if it makes sense?

27
00:00:57.533 --> 00:00:59.766
You can ask me.

28
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.033
Go stop

29
00:01:06.533 --> 00:01:07.833
I let you go

30
00:01:08.266 --> 00:01:09.400
What do you mean?

31
00:01:10.133 --> 00:01:12.066
Didn't you just say it?

32
00:01:12.666 --> 00:01:14.766
Do you want to take him to count the pieces today?

33
00:01:17.566 --> 00:01:18.400
Jinghong

34
00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:20.433
come in

35
00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.600
Is he really the Lord of God?

36
00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.500
Impossible it's absolutely impossible

37
00:01:29.766 --> 00:01:31.066
Hahahaha

38
00:01:31.133 --> 00:01:35.100
The old man wants to see how you rape my son

39
00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:47.100
Jinghong, this is the teacher's Jinghong sword. What?

40
00:01:48.766 --> 00:01:49.400
That's impossible.

41
00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:54.400
So you can see how I count the pieces.

42
00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:55.800
Don't stop

43
00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:57.700
three
