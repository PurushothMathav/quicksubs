00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:12.566
I have such a good car

2
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:31.800
Two beautiful women have something to eat

3
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.500
Our oysters and kidneys

4
00:00:33.733 --> 00:00:34.900
That's this one.

5
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.266
Lord God

6
00:00:39.266 --> 00:00:40.366
From today onwards

7
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.200
You are the lord of our building temple

8
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.900
The ninth brother of the right guardian

9
00:00:44.966 --> 00:00:46.833
Subordinate Left Law Protector Style

10
00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:48.066
Let demolition

11
00:00:49.066 --> 00:00:49.866
Hey

12
00:00:52.366 --> 00:00:53.766
Hey, get up, get up

13
00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.033
Oh, I see.

14
00:00:59.166 --> 00:01:00.700
You are shooting short videos, right?

15
00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.566
Whoops, I'm busy.

16
00:01:02.933 --> 00:01:04.433
Ouch I fuck my kidney

17
00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.300
What to do

18
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.433
Ouch, I'm busy.

19
00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.800
Don't mess with my stuff, I have surveillance here

20
00:01:25.766 --> 00:01:28.666
Brother Jiu can really pretend to be the Lord God

21
00:01:28.666 --> 00:01:30.133
Did you deceive those who rebelled?

22
00:01:30.133 --> 00:01:31.633
God has been missing for many years

23
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.300
Because I've been searching for years without a word

24
00:01:34.533 --> 00:01:37.000
According to the four words left by the Lord God in the temple

25
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.566
God is only possible in Yancheng

26
00:01:38.566 --> 00:01:39.900
Shenqi Yancheng

27
00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:40.566
Exactly.

28
00:01:40.566 --> 00:01:43.400
Only the words Shenqi Yancheng were left on the stone pillars of the temple

29
00:01:43.866 --> 00:01:45.633
Now we have traveled all over Yancheng

30
00:01:46.966 --> 00:01:49.733
Only he looks the same as the Lord God

31
00:01:49.733 --> 00:01:51.266
If he cannot replace the Lord God

32
00:01:51.266 --> 00:01:51.766
So you

33
00:01:51.766 --> 00:01:54.400
I will even destroy the entire temple

34
00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:55.400
So he

35
00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.766
Is our only hope

36
00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.700
Whose nice family orders so many kidneys at night?

37
00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.100
Busy at night

38
00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:16.433
Mr. Lu, do you like the way people look?

39
00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.366
You are so tempting

40
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.300
You look like this.

41
00:02:26.366 --> 00:02:29.066
Haven't you seen that trash yet?

42
00:02:29.066 --> 00:02:30.266
What is he?

43
00:02:30.266 --> 00:02:31.800
Why show him

44
00:02:32.666 --> 00:02:34.666
Aren't you afraid of being discovered by him?

45
00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:38.366
What if his trash found it?

46
00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:40.600
Wait until after supper

47
00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:44.666
I'll clean up for him, haha, hello.

48
00:02:44.666 --> 00:02:45.766
Takeout arrived

49
00:02:45.966 --> 00:02:47.900
The door is open, come in by yourself

50
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.966
People can't wait

51
00:02:55.466 --> 00:02:56.466
