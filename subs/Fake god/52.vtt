00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:03.866
What do you mean, Miss 2?

2
00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:05.766
What do I mean, you don't understand?

3
00:00:05.766 --> 00:00:06.966
Someone is pretending to be a god

4
00:00:06.966 --> 00:00:08.100
He is the Lord God

5
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:09.500
Also my fiancé

6
00:00:09.666 --> 00:00:11.700
I don't believe who doesn't know

7
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.200
Once the king of side by side was sealed, he immediately returned to Kyoto

8
00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.300
How can you laugh at you just by talking and laughing?

9
00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:17.300
Am I wrong?

10
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:18.533
Except for your family of three

11
00:00:18.533 --> 00:00:20.266
Who has really seen the Lord God?

12
00:00:20.366 --> 00:00:22.466
I see you just want to take advantage of the dinner party

13
00:00:22.466 --> 00:00:24.000
Seize the property of our Bai family

14
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.400
I deliberately found a fake to fool the old man

15
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.466
I said hey, I don't know.

16
00:00:28.466 --> 00:00:30.000
The hottest news of the last few days

17
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.466
It's about true and false gods

18
00:00:31.466 --> 00:00:32.800
With God as your fiancé

19
00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.466
Find a fake temporary replacement

20
00:00:34.466 --> 00:00:35.266
No price

21
00:00:35.266 --> 00:00:37.866
But I want to see if the old man finds out

22
00:00:37.866 --> 00:00:39.200
What would he say?

23
00:00:39.866 --> 00:00:41.033
We'll see.

24
00:00:43.466 --> 00:00:45.700
The young master doesn't know where he got the news from

25
00:00:45.966 --> 00:00:48.300
It must be said that the Lord God returned to Kyoto after being sealed

26
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.633
I'll practice for a while.

27
00:00:49.666 --> 00:00:52.066
There will be trouble

28
00:00:53.466 --> 00:00:55.300
Lord God, let's go

29
00:00:59.666 --> 00:01:01.400
The guests are almost all here

30
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:04.866
sir

31
00:01:05.666 --> 00:01:09.200
Oh, this is the brother-in-law, right?
