1
00:00:00.533 --> 00:00:01.333
open

2
00:00:04.933 --> 00:00:05.966
Sword of the Lord

3
00:00:05.966 --> 00:00:07.266
How is that possible?

4
00:00:07.366 --> 00:00:10.000
Of course it was a fluke

5
00:00:10.566 --> 00:00:11.400
That's not possible.

6
00:00:11.966 --> 00:00:13.566
Then take a look again.

7
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.066
Experimental Cloak

8
00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:19.066
invincible

9
00:00:22.133 --> 00:00:22.900
As a cape

10
00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.166
The Lord God was wearing this cape back then

11
00:00:25.166 --> 00:00:27.433
Invincible in the army of a million

12
00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:28.833
Play a role

13
00:00:28.866 --> 00:00:29.900
Blood stained thousands of miles

14
00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:31.200
The Lord is Coming

15
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:32.366
The Lord is Coming

16
00:00:32.566 --> 00:00:33.633
Absolutely impossible

17
00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:34.566
Who are you?

18
00:00:34.566 --> 00:00:36.000
I am the Lord of God

19
00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.266
How could this be?

20
00:00:37.766 --> 00:00:38.566
Condor

21
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:40.000
come

22
00:00:43.966 --> 00:00:46.766
I said the Seal of God

23
00:00:46.966 --> 00:00:48.266
I can control it.

24
00:00:48.366 --> 00:00:49.566
How could this be?

25
00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:51.366
Isn't the Lord God already dead?

26
00:00:51.366 --> 00:00:52.866
I am the Lord of God

27
00:00:53.133 --> 00:00:54.500
Two for ants

28
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.400
Security is not expensive
