00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:01.700
I didn't see it with my own eyes

2
00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:04.300
Water is water, and everyone must make their own judgment

3
00:00:04.366 --> 00:00:06.900
It's either what you say with your face or what you believe

4
00:00:06.966 --> 00:00:08.533
What do you mean just heard?

5
00:00:08.533 --> 00:00:10.300
I still have the video from that year.

6
00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:12.000
Who wants to say that I will show it to everyone for free?

7
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.400
Hey, isn't that right?

8
00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.166
Then why do you keep defending this little bitch?

9
00:00:15.166 --> 00:00:17.066
Are you?

10
00:00:17.866 --> 00:00:19.166
Are you sure you slept with him too?

11
00:00:19.166 --> 00:00:21.866
Hey, hey, you don't sleep, I'm shooting people

12
00:00:21.966 --> 00:00:24.266
The two of you are suspected of making a fuss and slandering others

13
00:00:24.266 --> 00:00:25.433
Come with me, please.

14
00:00:25.666 --> 00:00:26.966
What slander

15
00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.266
You arrest people indiscriminately, and I won't sue you for slander?

16
00:00:29.266 --> 00:00:30.833
It's Mr. Police

17
00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:34.133
This phone has their husband and wife channel in it.

18
00:00:34.133 --> 00:00:35.200
And abuse

19
00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.266
What's wrong with me?

20
00:00:37.266 --> 00:00:38.566
It is our own family who are insulted.

21
00:00:38.566 --> 00:00:39.866
What's wrong with others?

22
00:00:39.866 --> 00:00:42.500
My affair is no longer the affair of the past

23
00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.200
You're still the same. You haven't made any progress

24
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.500
They don't deserve to be my opponent

25
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.166
You little bitch, I'm waiting for you

26
00:00:52.766 --> 00:00:54.566
Miss Si, you are predictable

27
00:00:54.566 --> 00:00:55.900
It's not what I expected

28
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.333
It's them who can't stop eating shit

29
00:00:57.333 --> 00:00:59.766
Now they need at least a few kilometers.

30
00:01:00.066 --> 00:01:02.200
5 days is too cheap for them.

31
00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:03.900
Give you the evidence I gave you earlier

32
00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:04.966
Bring it all up

33
00:01:04.966 --> 00:01:07.166
I want everyone who framed me back then

34
00:01:07.166 --> 00:01:08.633
Get the punishment they deserve

35
00:01:08.866 --> 00:01:10.266
Ok, I'll do it right now

36
00:01:10.266 --> 00:01:11.233
Thanks

37
00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:20.600
grandma

38
00:01:21.333 --> 00:01:25.466
I'm angry with you, why didn't I accompany you?

39
00:01:26.533 --> 00:01:28.500
He is busy with work

40
00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:29.333
Come come

41
00:01:29.333 --> 00:01:31.966
Come with me to Xiangxiang City to see him

42
00:01:31.966 --> 00:01:33.700
Xiangxiang's medical conditions are better

43
00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.833
Let's deceive grandma first and then explain

44
00:01:37.133 --> 00:01:38.833
Look at grandma's body

45
00:01:39.366 --> 00:01:42.533
Grandma, don't you want to see your grandson-in-law?

46
00:01:42.533 --> 00:01:45.500
I have so much to tell him

47
00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.766
I'm afraid he won't want to do it for you old lady

48
00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.500
Grandma Dong, you are an elder.

49
00:01:52.666 --> 00:01:55.466
If he dares not listen to you, I will go back and deal with him

50
00:01:55.466 --> 00:01:56.766
What should I say then?

51
00:01:56.766 --> 00:02:00.300
Hangjiang, who wants to get a divorce, is cooperating with me to act

52
00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.800
It seems that you have a good position in the field of expertise

53
00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.466
high good
