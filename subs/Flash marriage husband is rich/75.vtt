1
00:00:05.666 --> 00:00:07.300
Will I let you do the work?

2
00:00:36.366 --> 00:00:37.166
dead warp

3
00:00:55.566 --> 00:00:56.433
No way.

4
00:00:57.266 --> 00:00:58.500
I want to take advantage of the danger

5
00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:00.466
Especially this guy.

6
00:01:01.133 --> 00:01:02.066
Or the death penalty

7
00:01:05.333 --> 00:01:07.500
Let's hold on a little longer

8
00:01:07.766 --> 00:01:10.666
Just wait until Shen Sheng comes

9
00:01:11.766 --> 00:01:12.966
Just in case.

10
00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.700
I'm going to the corner furthest from you now.

11
00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.033
I want to see each other

12
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:19.866
Do you understand?

13
00:01:30.066 --> 00:01:31.433
No, there was an accident.

14
00:01:31.866 --> 00:01:32.700
What an accident?

15
00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.100
So flustered

16
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.166
Isn't this stopped?

17
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.500
7 kilometers, that kid is eventful

18
00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.266
Switched roles with Mr. Zhan

19
00:01:42.366 --> 00:01:43.866
I gave up all plans

20
00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:45.666
Leave the little cool ball now

21
00:01:45.933 --> 00:01:48.066
You prepared so much that he gave up.

22
00:01:49.466 --> 00:01:52.333
Idiot, let Beiting catch Zhao

23
00:01:52.333 --> 00:01:54.700
We're all dead. Divide

24
00:01:58.333 --> 00:01:59.766
Isn't this surname Ping?

25
00:01:59.766 --> 00:02:00.866
It's too late.

26
00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.300
Tell me about it.

27
00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:03.433
Let's go!
