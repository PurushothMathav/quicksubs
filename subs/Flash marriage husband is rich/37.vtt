00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:02.066
How dare you listen to him

2
00:00:02.366 --> 00:00:04.800
Madam is also worried that you care about me

3
00:00:06.066 --> 00:00:07.766
Ask about my assistant

4
00:00:08.166 --> 00:00:09.966
What does it matter to care about me?

5
00:00:10.166 --> 00:00:11.366
You got it.

6
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.066
Madam has always hoped that you can be with Miss Gu

7
00:00:14.066 --> 00:00:15.900
Afraid that you will be fascinated by the women outside

8
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:16.700
Humph

9
00:00:17.466 --> 00:00:20.466
He doesn't worry about my registered wife.

10
00:00:20.866 --> 00:00:22.766
Worried about my little assistant

11
00:00:23.733 --> 00:00:24.733
Madam knows

12
00:00:24.733 --> 00:00:27.033
You registered for marriage to deal with old ladies

13
00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:28.433
Private sleeping is different

14
00:00:28.466 --> 00:00:29.900
He is young and beautiful

15
00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:31.366
Your personal assistant again

16
00:00:31.866 --> 00:00:33.300
But here's the thing.

17
00:00:33.333 --> 00:00:36.300
He's only been with you for a few days and you're getting a divorce

18
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.300
No matter what my reason is

19
00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:40.566
As long as the marriage contract is broken

20
00:00:40.733 --> 00:00:42.800
Even if it exists in name only

21
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
I can't be lucky for 10,000 years

22
00:00:46.266 --> 00:00:47.466
Go back and tell you

23
00:00:49.333 --> 00:00:52.566
If he moved my wife

24
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.900
I will make him regret it for the rest of his life

25
00:00:57.766 --> 00:01:00.966
Mr. Zhang, I didn't let you leave the soldier

26
00:01:02.066 --> 00:01:04.166
It is the greatest kindness I can offer

27
00:01:06.466 --> 00:01:08.700
Aren't you all worried about our little brother?

28
00:01:09.766 --> 00:01:11.866
Then I'm here, not you?
