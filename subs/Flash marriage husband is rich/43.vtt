00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.566
Grandma knows you're busy with work

2
00:00:02.566 --> 00:00:04.700
Grandma, this Spring Festival

3
00:00:05.066 --> 00:00:07.666
I'm going to Xiangjiang to see you two

4
00:00:07.666 --> 00:00:09.700
Oops, it just so happens that grandma is in love.

5
00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:10.466
Look at my husband

6
00:00:10.466 --> 00:00:12.000
You can't hide this

7
00:00:14.266 --> 00:00:16.766
No, I have to vaccinate grandma in advance

8
00:00:16.766 --> 00:00:19.166
Otherwise, he will definitely be angry by then

9
00:00:19.166 --> 00:00:21.133
Hey, grandma, say now

10
00:00:21.133 --> 00:00:22.566
In fact, many people are not married

11
00:00:22.566 --> 00:00:23.866
That's a happy life

12
00:00:23.866 --> 00:00:26.666
It's their business if they don't get married

13
00:00:26.666 --> 00:00:29.566
You're married, you have to live a good life

14
00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.866
What if people don't want to have a good time with me?

15
00:00:33.266 --> 00:00:34.700
Hangxiang can marry you

16
00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.433
I don't know how many lifetimes of happiness I have cultivated

17
00:00:37.566 --> 00:00:39.466
Will he have a good time?

18
00:00:39.466 --> 00:00:41.733
Did he bully you?

19
00:00:41.733 --> 00:00:42.533
How come?

20
00:00:42.533 --> 00:00:43.900
You are very nice to me

21
00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:47.133
If he treats you badly, we'll leave

22
00:00:47.133 --> 00:00:48.900
No matter whose grandson he is

23
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.633
Grandma wouldn't forgive him

24
00:00:50.966 --> 00:00:51.800
grandma

25
00:00:52.766 --> 00:00:55.666
I love you grandma loves you too

26
00:01:04.933 --> 00:01:06.866
How did he know I wasn't asleep?

27
00:01:06.933 --> 00:01:09.466
Are you looking for me to work again in the middle of the night?

28
00:01:14.933 --> 00:01:16.533
What's the matter with you?

29
00:01:16.533 --> 00:01:17.966
In fact, you can tell me on WeChat.

30
00:01:17.966 --> 00:01:19.766
No need to knock on the door

31
00:01:37.066 --> 00:01:40.000
Siqing, I apologize to you for what happened yesterday.

32
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.566
I shouldn't have said those things

33
00:01:42.166 --> 00:01:43.266
Please help me stand

34
00:01:43.266 --> 00:01:44.500
Tell him not to drive me away

35
00:01:44.766 --> 00:01:46.500
I can accept your apology.

36
00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:47.800
But drive you away from the warrior

37
00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:48.900
That's Mr. Zhan's decision

38
00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.966
No one can change his mind. Go back
