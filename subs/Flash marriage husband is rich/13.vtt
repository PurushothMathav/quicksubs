00:00:04.133 --> 00:00:04.933
Hey

2
00:00:05.366 --> 00:00:07.866
Which young man was rejected?

3
00:00:08.166 --> 00:00:09.600
What a waste

4
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.300
Hey stuff

5
00:00:21.666 --> 00:00:22.766
Go, go, go, go

6
00:00:23.866 --> 00:00:25.033
You don't know

7
00:00:25.133 --> 00:00:27.166
A man knocked on our door just now.

8
00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.666
What should he be?

9
00:00:29.666 --> 00:00:32.300
He asked me anything, and I told him everything.

10
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:33.166
Hey, but

11
00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:36.366
Fortunately, I woke up in time and took him away

12
00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.200
The way that man looked at me

13
00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.200
Just want to swallow me alive

14
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.866
Haha, the population flow in our community is quite large.

15
00:00:42.966 --> 00:00:45.600
I also heard about an apology the other day.

16
00:00:45.666 --> 00:00:47.433
The three of us have to be careful in the future

17
00:00:47.466 --> 00:00:49.700
I'll go online and buy a surveillance camera to install the door.

18
00:00:49.933 --> 00:00:51.900
Call me in advance when you get off work late in the future

19
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:52.866
I'll pick you up downstairs

20
00:00:52.966 --> 00:00:53.933
Okay, that's good.

21
00:00:53.933 --> 00:00:57.300
This, but that guy is pretty good-looking.

22
00:00:57.533 --> 00:00:58.900
Miss

23
00:00:58.966 --> 00:01:02.566
Don't be deceived by the good looks of bad men

24
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.166
But that guy is really good-looking.

25
00:01:07.766 --> 00:01:09.633
Hey, okay, go, go, go

26
00:01:21.266 --> 00:01:22.100
Forget it. Forget it.

27
00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:23.800
I must have read it wrong.

28
00:01:23.866 --> 00:01:25.266
I bought a piece for the station manager

29
00:01:25.266 --> 00:01:27.033
How could it possibly appear at my door?
