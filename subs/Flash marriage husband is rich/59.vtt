00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:02.666
Don't you know who your sister-in-law is?

2
00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.233
My sister-in-law

3
00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:05.700
Why are you back?

4
00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.566
Come back for your birthday?

5
00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:08.900
You still kill me

6
00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:11.100
You curse people indiscriminately

7
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:12.200
Did I scold you wrong?

8
00:00:12.666 --> 00:00:15.133
And I haven't seen you gain knowledge in recent years

9
00:00:15.133 --> 00:00:17.366
This scolding has taken a lot of time

10
00:00:17.366 --> 00:00:19.466
Brother, am I wrong?

11
00:00:19.466 --> 00:00:21.866
I'm also afraid that you will be deceived by your bad daughter.

12
00:00:21.866 --> 00:00:23.633
Then if you are worried, I can curse people casually.

13
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.666
Is the person next to me yours?

14
00:00:26.933 --> 00:00:27.966
Father sister

15
00:00:27.966 --> 00:00:30.533
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to scold you just now.

16
00:00:30.533 --> 00:00:32.066
Can you forgive me?

17
00:00:32.066 --> 00:00:33.600
I know you didn't mean to scold me either.

18
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:34.566
It doesn't matter.

19
00:00:34.566 --> 00:00:36.266
You are so kind

20
00:00:36.266 --> 00:00:38.066
You will be my friend from now on

21
00:00:38.066 --> 00:00:40.533
Is the girl a little too enthusiastic?

22
00:00:40.533 --> 00:00:41.333
Beijing brother

23
00:00:43.766 --> 00:00:45.500
Long time no see brother Beitian

24
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:46.833
I miss you so much!

25
00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:52.100
Who are you?

26
00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.233
Why think

27
00:00:54.133 --> 00:00:56.466
This way of rejecting the opposite sex

28
00:00:56.533 --> 00:00:58.700
It's so simple and rude

29
00:00:58.766 --> 00:01:01.433
Brother Beijing, don't you remember me?

30
00:01:01.666 --> 00:01:02.266
brother

31
00:01:02.266 --> 00:01:05.600
He is Xixi, you even hugged him when you were a child

32
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.400
If that woman hadn't suddenly appeared

33
00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:08.200
Maybe.

34
00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.200
He will become your wife

35
00:01:10.866 --> 00:01:11.933
Who told you that?

36
00:01:11.933 --> 00:01:13.900
You will talk nonsense about this in the future.

37
00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:17.000
I take care of your actor, I'm fine

38
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.100
Don't think I'm arguing with Brother Beiting

39
00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.166
Really, take your friend away

40
00:01:23.166 --> 00:01:26.266
In the future, don't go home to outsiders, just leave
