00:00:00.566 --> 00:00:01.366
Yo

2
00:00:02.566 --> 00:00:04.633
Xiaoqiang, how do you look?

3
00:00:05.066 --> 00:00:06.966
Handsome than in the photo

4
00:00:09.066 --> 00:00:11.300
Mom, take a good look at you, sit down

5
00:00:11.966 --> 00:00:13.566
Let me have a look.

6
00:00:15.133 --> 00:00:19.033
Xiao Jiang, I heard that Xiaoqin say

7
00:00:19.066 --> 00:00:22.633
You don't stay in Jiangbei for a few days a month

8
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.866
How do you cultivate your relationship?

9
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:27.800
Xiao Li

10
00:00:28.766 --> 00:00:32.166
I would like to have a private chat with my grandson-in-law

11
00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:35.266
You do your work first

12
00:00:36.766 --> 00:00:38.700
How could God be so troubled?

13
00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:44.000
Xiao Jiang, can you take time out of your busy schedule to look at me?

14
00:00:45.066 --> 00:00:47.200
Grandma is so happy

15
00:00:47.733 --> 00:00:49.966
Grandma, I should do this.

16
00:00:49.966 --> 00:00:50.833
Xiao Jiang

17
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.266
You and Xiaoqing didn't fall in love first and then get married

18
00:00:56.366 --> 00:00:58.266
You are naturally emotional

19
00:00:58.733 --> 00:01:00.100
Won't be much better

20
00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.800
You need to spend more time cultivating and cultivating relationships

21
00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.800
No matter how busy we are with work

22
00:01:05.966 --> 00:01:08.033
Don't forget family

23
00:01:08.066 --> 00:01:09.966
Do you think so?

24
00:01:10.733 --> 00:01:11.533
OK

25
00:01:12.166 --> 00:01:14.300
Xiao Jiang, do you know?

26
00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.766
Xiaoqing's character is very stubborn

27
00:01:16.766 --> 00:01:19.800
Many times he doesn't want to be in front of people

28
00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.733
Show his weak side

29
00:01:21.733 --> 00:01:23.400
A lot of things.

30
00:01:23.666 --> 00:01:25.166
Buried in my heart

31
00:01:25.566 --> 00:01:27.666
You have to take good care of him

32
00:01:27.966 --> 00:01:29.200
Yeah, OK.

33
00:01:29.266 --> 00:01:32.800
Xiaojiao, did you quarrel with Xiaoqing?

34
00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:36.666
Grandma, we didn't fight.

35
00:01:36.666 --> 00:01:38.466
Like you just said

36
00:01:38.466 --> 00:01:40.700
We had no emotional foundation before marriage

37
00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:42.533
After marriage, because of work

38
00:01:42.533 --> 00:01:46.133
The former feelings of gathering less and leaving more, please be running in.

39
00:01:46.133 --> 00:01:48.166
What break-in?

40
00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.366
It's been more than a year and still running in

41
00:01:50.366 --> 00:01:52.800
It's obvious that you have a bad relationship

42
00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.366
Xiaoqin has been in front of me for more than a year

43
00:01:55.366 --> 00:01:58.033
Always pretending to be happy

44
00:01:58.566 --> 00:02:00.200
Cool me old woman

45
00:02:00.266 --> 00:02:01.666
Tell me the truth.

46
00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.266
Are you in a bad relationship?
