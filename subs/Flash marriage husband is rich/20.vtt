00:00:01.666 --> 00:00:03.966
Mr. Zhang, how is the divorce contract you want?

2
00:00:03.966 --> 00:00:05.266
Death penalty spirit goes abroad

3
00:00:05.266 --> 00:00:08.066
At the same time, you will be compensated 10 million for your mental damage

4
00:00:08.666 --> 00:00:09.466
Oh.

5
00:00:09.933 --> 00:00:11.766
Those who have the courage to betray me

6
00:00:11.766 --> 00:00:13.666
You have to bear the consequences of betrayal

7
00:00:13.866 --> 00:00:15.900
Please contact that woman tomorrow.

8
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.966
Let him initiate divorce

9
00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:23.400
I promise you.

10
00:00:23.766 --> 00:00:25.200
Let him take the initiative to remind

11
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.566
I didn't say I wouldn't let the lawyer remind him to wake up

12
00:00:32.466 --> 00:00:35.466
Mr. Zhan, you are looking for me.

13
00:00:36.166 --> 00:00:37.033
Tonight.

14
00:00:37.133 --> 00:00:39.633
You accompany me to a strange new wedding reception

15
00:00:39.733 --> 00:00:42.666
Mr. Zhan, you are not angry with me anymore

16
00:00:42.766 --> 00:00:44.633
Same name as that disgusting woman

17
00:00:44.766 --> 00:00:45.900
No wonder she

18
00:00:58.133 --> 00:01:01.166
Miss Si, may I invite you to a dance?

19
00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:03.566
Ride on, sorry?

20
00:01:03.566 --> 00:01:05.000
I can't dance.

21
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.200
I can teach you.

22
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.100
before you

23
00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.633
Didn't you ask me if I had a boyfriend?

24
00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:14.833
Are you pretending to have a boyfriend and trying to reject me?

25
00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.266
I don't have a boyfriend.

26
00:01:17.866 --> 00:01:19.833
Then I can chase you.

27
00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:21.000
I have a husband

28
00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.066
The first time I heard a woman

29
00:01:26.066 --> 00:01:28.900
Reject me for such a reason

30
00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.900
Haha, I'm really not interested in you.

31
00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:33.100
Not now.

32
00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:34.566
There will never be

33
00:01:34.566 --> 00:01:37.466
So don't waste your time on me

34
00:01:37.966 --> 00:01:40.366
Hahaha, as the master, you don't recruit soldiers.

35
00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:42.566
Said my little assistant was hiding here chatting

36
00:01:43.533 --> 00:01:44.900
When did he come?

37
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.100
How much did he hear when I left Qi Meng just now?
