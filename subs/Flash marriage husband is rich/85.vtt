00:00:04.566 --> 00:00:06.700
The young master and the old lady don't want to listen to you

2
00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:08.433
Really you told grandma

3
00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:11.766
The woman's grandmother seems to be sick

4
00:00:11.766 --> 00:00:14.733
What do you mean your grandma is sick?

5
00:00:14.733 --> 00:00:15.800
When did this happen?

6
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.300
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

7
00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.700
Was Mr. Zhao lynched in the morning?

8
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.600
Lynching takes 10 days of annual leave

9
00:00:50.866 --> 00:00:51.666
oldest

10
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.266
I think now

11
00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:55.666
If memory serves

12
00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:58.833
The president has finished his work at noon

13
00:01:00.933 --> 00:01:02.766
Love me yellow stamen

14
00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:05.666
Yes

15
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.800
The president took the wrong medicine today

16
00:01:11.866 --> 00:01:13.966
4,000 come back and save me

17
00:01:15.866 --> 00:01:17.066
Xiaoqing

18
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.500
Grandma has a few more words to say to you, grandma

19
00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:22.066
You child

20
00:01:22.066 --> 00:01:23.666
Not only was she born beautiful

21
00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.766
The eyes are also very clean

22
00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.200
How do you like it?

23
00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.100
What can I do for you in the future?

24
00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.766
Be sure to let me know as soon as possible.

25
00:01:34.566 --> 00:01:36.266
We are a family.

26
00:01:36.733 --> 00:01:38.966
Especially my grandson

27
00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.500
He should do anything for you.

28
00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.900
Okay, what would I bother him with?

29
00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:47.500
I don't want to owe him a favor

30
00:01:47.533 --> 00:01:48.700
Xiaoqing

31
00:01:49.733 --> 00:01:51.900
Is he finished with his work?

32
00:01:51.933 --> 00:01:54.766
Can I see him tomorrow?
