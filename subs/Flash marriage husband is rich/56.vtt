00:00:01.133 --> 00:00:03.600
There is no taxi available in the villa area at this time.

2
00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:06.300
You can dance a guest on the second floor

3
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:07.200
Move in.

4
00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.700
This is what the station manager originally meant

5
00:00:09.766 --> 00:00:11.366
It's just my imagination.

6
00:00:11.366 --> 00:00:13.333
I'm afraid I'll disturb your rest.

7
00:00:13.333 --> 00:00:14.300
Or go first

8
00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:15.733
I sleep on the third floor, you sleep on the second floor

9
00:00:15.733 --> 00:00:17.933
What? Do you have long legs?

10
00:00:17.933 --> 00:00:19.233
Can mention the ceiling

11
00:00:19.866 --> 00:00:22.566
But it's already 2 a.m.

12
00:00:22.566 --> 00:00:23.966
You have to come tomorrow morning.

13
00:00:23.966 --> 00:00:25.866
Are you sure you want to go back now?

14
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.500
Then Mr. Chen, I'm welcome.

15
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.200
Thank you, we rest early.

16
00:00:51.733 --> 00:00:55.000
Does it mean that you can't stand on that side?

17
00:00:55.333 --> 00:00:57.700
Can't satisfy this lady

18
00:01:00.333 --> 00:01:01.133
birthday
