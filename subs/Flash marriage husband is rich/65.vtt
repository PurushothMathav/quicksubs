Miss 4, please take a seat

Mrs. Zhan, you can speak directly

00:00:10.333 --> 00:00:12.200
Have a cup of tea and chat slowly

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:19.966
how

6
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:22.466
Are you afraid that I will poison Charlie?

7
00:00:22.666 --> 00:00:25.166
Do I look like the bad guy?

8
00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.633
It's not that bad people would invite people over this way

9
00:00:28.733 --> 00:00:30.766
I just wanted to ask you

10
00:00:30.766 --> 00:00:33.033
What do you think of our Norland?

11
00:00:33.466 --> 00:00:35.100
Will any girls like it?

12
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.266
Mr. Zheng ranks single women in Xiangjiang all year round

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:39.333
The man I most want to marry

14
00:00:39.333 --> 00:00:41.500
Conservative, how can no girls like it?

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.300
Do you like him?

16
00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:44.866
Do you want to marry him?

17
00:00:45.333 --> 00:00:46.633
You can be honest.

18
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.600
If you like him

19
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.866
I'll let you marry him

20
00:00:50.866 --> 00:00:52.400
We can be mother-in-law and daughter-in-law.

21
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.300
Husband, I am Zheng Beiting's assistant

22
00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:56.466
My contact with him

23
00:00:56.466 --> 00:00:58.200
It's just a work thing

24
00:00:58.266 --> 00:00:59.733
I will never treat him

25
00:00:59.733 --> 00:01:01.266
Have any thoughts that shouldn't be

26
00:01:02.166 --> 00:01:05.500
What is this idea that shouldn't be?

27
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.466
Love is a beautiful thing

28
00:01:08.733 --> 00:01:11.233
It is also the most uncontrollable

29
00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.500
How can you call it an idea that shouldn't be?

30
00:01:14.566 --> 00:01:17.033
Mrs. Cheng, I am married

31
00:01:17.133 --> 00:01:19.500
I love my husband very much

32
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.366
You love your husband very much

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.900
Do you believe that?

34
00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.900
Did you sign the divorce agreement last Friday?

You really love your husband

38
00:01:41.766 --> 00:01:43.066
You follow me?

39
00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.666
I don't just want to follow you

40
00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:50.566
I also checked your weapon clearly

41
00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:52.166
Including sophomore year

42
00:01:52.166 --> 00:01:55.466
You seduce the neighbor's man
