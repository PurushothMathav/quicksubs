00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:01.366
My grandmother was very sick.

2
00:00:01.366 --> 00:00:02.900
I want to see my grandson-in-law every day

3
00:00:02.966 --> 00:00:04.466
I can't provoke him anymore

4
00:00:04.466 --> 00:00:06.600
So I can't divorce you for the time being.

5
00:00:06.666 --> 00:00:07.666
If it is convenient for you

6
00:00:07.666 --> 00:00:09.866
I would also like to invite you to the hospital to visit him

7
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.933
Just pretend to be married and loving

8
00:00:11.933 --> 00:00:13.166
Wait until he gets better

9
00:00:13.166 --> 00:00:14.500
I will definitely divorce you

10
00:00:14.966 --> 00:00:15.966
Green

11
00:00:15.966 --> 00:00:18.500
Can you call him directly?

12
00:00:18.733 --> 00:00:20.600
Yeah, grandma. Yeah.

13
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.333
He will be busy with work

14
00:00:22.333 --> 00:00:24.700
Sometimes it is not convenient to answer the phone.

15
00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:27.100
That's right, Mr. Tang

16
00:00:27.166 --> 00:00:28.566
If you see the message

17
00:00:28.566 --> 00:00:30.433
Please reply to me, okay?

18
00:00:34.533 --> 00:00:36.900
Mr. Tang, if you see the message

19
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:38.900
Please reply to me, okay?

20
00:00:42.066 --> 00:00:44.700
Ok thank you for agreeing to see my grandma

21
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.300
Excuse me, when will you come to my side to arrange?

22
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.833
It's hard to see you

23
00:00:50.466 --> 00:00:51.766
But I don't want to see you.

24
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:53.466
Then I'll make an appointment.

25
00:00:53.466 --> 00:00:55.366
I'll hand it to you when you come.

26
00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:57.800
Tomorrow phase

27
00:01:01.866 --> 00:01:03.266
When will the private message come back?

28
00:01:04.366 --> 00:01:06.366
I don't know either, I'm Mr. Zheng

29
00:01:09.666 --> 00:01:10.700
I sent you the address.

30
00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.600
Please don't talk to grandma then.

31
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.000
Say we're getting a divorce

32
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Thank you very much, Grandma.

33
00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:17.966
I've already agreed with the voyage

34
00:01:17.966 --> 00:01:19.566
Then I'll see you tomorrow afternoon.

35
00:01:19.566 --> 00:01:21.666
Great ouch

36
00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:23.266
Green

37
00:01:23.266 --> 00:01:26.266
This is the first time I see my son-in-law. Do you want to clean up?

38
00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:30.566
Oops, does this make a good impression?

39
00:01:30.566 --> 00:01:33.266
Grandma, he is your grandson-in-law

40
00:01:33.266 --> 00:01:34.600
Not a big leader

41
00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.466
No need

42
00:01:36.466 --> 00:01:37.933
In grandma's heart?

43
00:01:37.933 --> 00:01:39.966
He is more important than the leader

44
00:01:40.733 --> 00:01:43.633
I don't know if Hangjiang will tell me tomorrow.

45
00:01:53.933 --> 00:01:54.733
clear

46
00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:58.866
