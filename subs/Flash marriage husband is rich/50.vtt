00:00:00.766 --> 00:00:02.833
Qingqing, you are too strong

2
00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:05.066
You can face this kind of person without changing your face

3
00:00:05.133 --> 00:00:07.666
You just heard those words wrong. It's so cool.

4
00:00:07.766 --> 00:00:09.466
I stand every day waiting for you

5
00:00:09.466 --> 00:00:10.900
Is this little baked noodle worth it?

6
00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:12.900
Ah, good.

7
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:15.066
Let's eat hot pot

8
00:00:21.866 --> 00:00:25.200
How is your wife so beautiful?

9
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.933
It's a pity that someone else gave it up.

10
00:00:27.933 --> 00:00:29.700
But he's also a tough character

11
00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:32.966
In the face of my questioning, you actually don't change your face?

12
00:00:32.966 --> 00:00:34.866
The Prince of Justice is really

13
00:00:36.166 --> 00:00:37.700
But with the signature in the private assistant

14
00:00:37.733 --> 00:00:39.100
Totally a style

15
00:00:41.533 --> 00:00:42.833
Deal with it ASAP.

16
00:00:43.666 --> 00:00:45.100
Everything that needs to be done is done

17
00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:47.600
You only need to go retail in a month.

18
00:00:47.733 --> 00:00:48.766
One more person

19
00:00:48.766 --> 00:00:52.000
Don't worry, divorce has a theoretical period

20
00:00:52.133 --> 00:00:54.433
You're halfway there now.

21
00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:57.000
drink

22
00:00:58.133 --> 00:01:01.066
Ah, are you a brother like that?

23
00:01:01.366 --> 00:01:02.700
I scolded you in vain.

24
00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.066
You drive me away without giving me water to drink

25
00:01:07.266 --> 00:01:11.300
Aunt Chen, get our Master Lin a glass of water

26
00:01:17.166 --> 00:01:19.800
If the young master wants to mess around, you should mess around with him too

27
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.933
I thought the young master was back

28
00:01:21.933 --> 00:01:23.800
You can live a good life with the young lady

29
00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.800
Then you came and said they were getting a divorce

30
00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.266
What's the matter
