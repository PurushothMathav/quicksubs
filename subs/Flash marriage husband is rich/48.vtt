00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:01.266
Miss 4

2
00:00:01.866 --> 00:00:02.766
My surname is Lin

3
00:00:02.966 --> 00:00:05.566
Invite me to draw this sum in the future, sir

4
00:00:05.566 --> 00:00:06.366
divorce

5
00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.100
This is the divorce agreement

6
00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:11.100
You see if there is no problem.

7
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:11.900
Please sign

8
00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:14.866
Well, do you still need to sign the divorce agreement?

9
00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:17.500
I have never been divorced

10
00:00:17.933 --> 00:00:20.233
I don't quite understand, take a closer look first

11
00:00:20.933 --> 00:00:23.166
It's okay for a woman to be funny

12
00:00:24.933 --> 00:00:27.833
That kid in Beijing is really afraid to look at his emotions

13
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.733
Married to such a beautiful woman

14
00:00:29.733 --> 00:00:32.300
He was even willing to leave her and beg for it alone

15
00:00:32.766 --> 00:00:33.800
There we go.

16
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.166
Let other men relieve their hearts

17
00:00:36.666 --> 00:00:40.366
The heart pays the man 10 million for mental damage

18
00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.166
Married for a year and a half

19
00:00:43.166 --> 00:00:45.700
I've never met or had any trouble with him

20
00:00:45.766 --> 00:00:48.366
Even if you get divorced, you should get together and break up

21
00:00:48.366 --> 00:00:51.266
I didn't expect him to speak out

22
00:00:51.966 --> 00:00:52.833
Lawyer Lin

23
00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.966
What's up with the 10 million in mental damages?

24
00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.800
Miss Si, what have you done?

25
00:01:00.066 --> 00:01:01.233
You should know best

26
00:01:01.666 --> 00:01:03.966
This woman should be a master of love

27
00:01:03.966 --> 00:01:05.866
All caught in bed

28
00:01:05.866 --> 00:01:07.400
He can still look the same today.

29
00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:08.566
What did I do?

30
00:01:08.566 --> 00:01:09.866
What about some things?

31
00:01:09.866 --> 00:01:11.400
We know it.

32
00:01:11.866 --> 00:01:13.266
If you have to play dumb

33
00:01:13.266 --> 00:01:14.566
Then don't blame me for being rude.

34
00:01:14.566 --> 00:01:16.000
What about this theory study book?

35
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.200
You have to sign

36
00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.066
You have to sign

37
00:01:24.266 --> 00:01:25.133
I just won't sign

38
00:01:25.133 --> 00:01:25.933
What can you do to me?

39
00:01:25.933 --> 00:01:28.200
I suggest you sign it anyway

40
00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.766
Anything is easy to say

41
00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.666
Ms. Lin, could you please tell me?

42
00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.100
If he really wants a divorce

43
00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:35.266
Then let's make an appointment.

44
00:01:35.266 --> 00:01:36.966
Just go to the Civil Affairs Bureau and get the certificate.

45
00:01:36.966 --> 00:01:38.766
If he's trying to scam me out of money

46
00:01:38.766 --> 00:01:39.666
Sorry about that.

47
00:01:39.766 --> 00:01:41.800
He doesn't even think about it.
