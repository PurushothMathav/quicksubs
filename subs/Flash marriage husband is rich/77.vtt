00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:19.033
Hahaha, I think the voice of this song I've listened to

2
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.433
What do you want to say?

3
00:00:21.266 --> 00:00:26.100
I saw your wife and his wild man here too

4
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.000
Do you want to go say hi?

5
00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.900
Let's go, everyone, this is a husband and wife after all

6
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.433
The man who is green in the world doesn't know, do you know?

7
00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:47.633
Nothing I don't know

8
00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.300
You told him about the divorce in the afternoon

9
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:52.466
I'll notify right away

10
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.966
I forgot to tell you just now.

11
00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:08.966
A month of cold war between you and Mr. Hang

12
00:01:08.966 --> 00:01:10.066
The time has come.

13
00:01:10.066 --> 00:01:11.666
Today at 3pm.

14
00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.400
The roller skating conference registration office cannot handle it

15
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.000
OK

16
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.033
What's up?

17
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.200
It's one of the big three.

18
00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:23.766
Promotion and salary increase

19
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.066
Husband, hahaha, that's right.

20
00:01:26.066 --> 00:01:26.966
Something like that.

21
00:01:26.966 --> 00:01:29.200
You and I at that time at 3 o'clock in the afternoon

22
00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.300
Divorce now cell phone

23
00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:32.633
I'm going back to being single soon.

24
00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.700
The days before that were no different from being single, right?

25
00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.800
But there is a deep blessing.

26
00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.233
Different handsome guy, I'm interesting

27
00:01:42.133 --> 00:01:44.333
Since all good things come together

28
00:01:44.333 --> 00:01:46.266
Then we must celebrate tonight

29
00:01:46.266 --> 00:01:48.200
Celebrate how about we have a drink

30
00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.433
Let's replace the wine with tea first, okay, hehe
