00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:02.200
As long as you don't ruin my business

2
00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:04.033
Of course I won't make it difficult for you.

3
00:00:04.366 --> 00:00:07.200
This girl is well-behaved and docile in front of the station manager

4
00:00:07.266 --> 00:00:10.166
As soon as he left, he showed his true colors

5
00:00:10.933 --> 00:00:11.800
Don't worry.

6
00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.866
Self-knowledge is my greatest strength as a person

7
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.000
Go to work first

8
00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:18.700
Thank you.

9
00:00:20.766 --> 00:00:21.400
Mr. Shang

10
00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.400
It seems that you didn't remember a word if I went abroad

11
00:00:24.966 --> 00:00:27.533
Mr. Shang, what are my shortcomings at work?

12
00:00:27.533 --> 00:00:28.766
You can directly call the roll call.

13
00:00:28.766 --> 00:00:31.400
I will definitely try my best until you are satisfied.

14
00:00:31.733 --> 00:00:34.100
I said it was about work

15
00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:36.266
Then you mean

16
00:00:37.133 --> 00:00:38.300
Go eat first

17
00:00:41.333 --> 00:00:41.900
I miss it so much

18
00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.800
The days when I used to play around with my brothers

19
00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.200
What do you miss?

20
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.366
If we hadn't been stalking each other when we were kids

21
00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.166
They don't want to take us

22
00:00:50.166 --> 00:00:51.500
Especially my brother

23
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.500
I don't know what you like about him

24
00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.000
Do you need a reason to like someone?

25
00:00:56.066 --> 00:00:57.900
Anyway, when I was very young

26
00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:00.133
I want to be Beiting's brother's bride

27
00:01:00.133 --> 00:01:02.633
I will never marry anyone but him in my life
