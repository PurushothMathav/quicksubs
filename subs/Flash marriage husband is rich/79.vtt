00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:03.866
Hey, didn't we say it all?

2
00:00:03.866 --> 00:00:04.600
We have no money

3
00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:07.200
Why did you pull the old woman to that place again?

4
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.266
What clothes are inside?

5
00:00:08.266 --> 00:00:09.266
No one knows

6
00:00:09.266 --> 00:00:10.800
There's a day's price hidden here

7
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.166
Oops, it's expensive to die for.

8
00:00:12.166 --> 00:00:13.666
Get that out now!

9
00:00:13.666 --> 00:00:14.900
Don't try to steal my money.

10
00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:17.633
It's just that the old lady is getting old

11
00:00:17.766 --> 00:00:20.966
Spending hundreds of thousands on medical treatment is a waste of money and food

12
00:00:20.966 --> 00:00:23.166
Why don't you give us this money?

13
00:00:23.166 --> 00:00:26.066
It would be great to buy a wedding room for my son then

14
00:00:26.066 --> 00:00:27.566
Are you still human?

15
00:00:27.866 --> 00:00:29.666
This patient is your mother

16
00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:30.566
Is that so?

17
00:00:30.566 --> 00:00:32.700
I'm afraid that your son will do the same to you in the future.

18
00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.300
Hey, are you a doctor?

19
00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.966
How dare you curse our patient's family?

20
00:00:37.066 --> 00:00:38.566
I want to complain to you, okay?

21
00:00:38.566 --> 00:00:40.600
I want to complain to you.

22
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:41.700
I want to tell you

23
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.700
Let you pay us for mental loss

24
00:00:44.066 --> 00:00:45.233
Call your leader

25
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.966
The old lady sent you last night

26
00:00:47.966 --> 00:00:50.866
The two at night are unwilling to see each other

27
00:00:50.866 --> 00:00:52.766
The old lady only has one word

28
00:00:52.766 --> 00:00:54.666
That old lady wants you old lady

29
00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:59.833
Still can't get anything out

30
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.600
I've been seeing a doctor all these years

31
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.666
Let you know about men

32
00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.800
There is still the face to do this kind of thing now

33
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:08.966
complaint

34
00:01:10.066 --> 00:01:11.300
You still have the face to complain.

35
00:01:11.933 --> 00:01:14.000
Did the doctor say something wrong?

36
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.066
Who are you 44

37
00:01:16.566 --> 00:01:19.200
I haven't seen this bitch grow in a few years

38
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.566
It's useless with a fox

39
00:01:20.566 --> 00:01:22.666
If you can find them a marriage

40
00:01:22.666 --> 00:01:24.333
You must get a high bride price.

41
00:01:24.333 --> 00:01:27.700
Then my son will not have to worry about not having a bride price to marry a wife

42
00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:29.666
Yo, it's an affair

43
00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.100
We all miss you if you don't go home for many years, hahaha.

44
00:01:33.266 --> 00:01:36.866
Yeah, come on. Come home with me. Let's get married!
