00:00:00.766 --> 00:00:01.866
What are you thinking about?

2
00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:05.600
Brother Chen, I can't blame this on me

3
00:00:06.766 --> 00:00:07.666
It's getting more and more painful

4
00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:09.000
I'm going abroad tomorrow.

5
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:09.700
It's your birthday?

6
00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:10.800
I won't accompany you to drink

7
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.800
I have a special gift for you

8
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:16.000
Let someone send you local coins later.

9
00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.800
Master, do you really want to divorce the young lady?

10
00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.200
I'm really not going to take him home

11
00:00:25.366 --> 00:00:27.900
There will be no young lady in this family in the future

12
00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.300
Don't keep talking about it

13
00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.700
Sugar Treasure, I'll just wipe myself little by little

14
00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:47.066
I'm really fine.

15
00:00:47.266 --> 00:00:49.100
It's okay. It's okay.

16
00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:50.666
Why don't I get out of bed and jump around for you?

17
00:00:50.666 --> 00:00:51.600
You'll be fine

18
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.466
Okay, no matter what, it's okay

19
00:00:53.466 --> 00:00:55.133
I must stay in the hospital for observation tonight

20
00:00:55.133 --> 00:00:56.300
You have to listen to me

21
00:00:56.966 --> 00:01:00.300
This is the man who made that woman die

22
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:01.966
I'd like to see it

23
00:01:02.333 --> 00:01:03.400
What does he look like?

24
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.700
Who are you looking for, sir?

25
00:01:09.733 --> 00:01:11.233
I married his boss

26
00:01:11.766 --> 00:01:12.900
He is injured.

27
00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.100
I have my husband by my side to ask for warmth
