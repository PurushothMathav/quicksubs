00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:02.000
What are you trying to do to me?

2
00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:04.666
Why does this dead child speak so badly?

3
00:00:04.733 --> 00:00:07.300
Just the idea of firing a shot, please go home and sit down?

4
00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:08.300
Go back and sit

5
00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:09.533
Just like that.

6
00:00:09.533 --> 00:00:11.466
The kind that can't get away if you go, right?

7
00:00:11.966 --> 00:00:13.766
You little bitch!

8
00:00:14.133 --> 00:00:16.566
We are in love with flesh and blood, regardless of the past

9
00:00:16.566 --> 00:00:17.933
You still mention that year

10
00:00:17.933 --> 00:00:18.900
Do you really think

11
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.966
Have we all forgotten what happened back then?

12
00:00:21.133 --> 00:00:23.066
Come and have a look if you pass by

13
00:00:23.066 --> 00:00:24.566
Look at this little fox

14
00:00:24.566 --> 00:00:26.133
What did you do back then?

15
00:00:26.133 --> 00:00:27.866
Shameful thing

16
00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.133
Who am I scolding?

17
00:00:35.133 --> 00:00:36.733
I'm scolding you

18
00:00:36.733 --> 00:00:39.333
At a young age, just like your mother did

19
00:00:39.333 --> 00:00:41.466
Just a piece of bitch material

20
00:00:41.466 --> 00:00:44.300
He actually robbed someone else's man

21
00:00:44.333 --> 00:00:45.733
Ah, three years ago.

22
00:00:45.733 --> 00:00:49.466
This quiet man seduces married men?

23
00:00:49.466 --> 00:00:51.066
Caught in bed by my wife

24
00:00:51.066 --> 00:00:53.233
You haven't forgotten this, have you?

25
00:00:53.666 --> 00:00:55.433
The heroine of that world

26
00:00:55.533 --> 00:00:56.533
Just stand here

27
00:00:56.533 --> 00:00:58.566
This slutty woman

28
00:00:58.566 --> 00:00:59.100
Oh, dear.

29
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.400
When I left Jiangbei City three years ago

30
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:02.966
That lover probably didn't forget

31
00:01:02.966 --> 00:01:04.266
It's only been a few years.

32
00:01:04.266 --> 00:01:06.400
Did you drop the p and call it back?

33
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.500
Oh, you really think we have a bad memory?
