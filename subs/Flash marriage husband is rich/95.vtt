00:00:00.933 --> 00:00:03.500
I came back to see if I was pissed off by you

2
00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:05.100
grandma

3
00:00:05.733 --> 00:00:07.700
I will not divorce an affair

4
00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:10.100
The affair will only be with my wife

5
00:00:10.133 --> 00:00:11.266
Pardon me?

6
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.366
What you said is true.

7
00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.966
Grandma you are right

8
00:00:16.466 --> 00:00:17.966
Siqing is a good girl

9
00:00:17.966 --> 00:00:19.566
I misunderstood her before

10
00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.300
Now I have to protect her

11
00:00:22.466 --> 00:00:24.033
Live well with her

12
00:00:24.766 --> 00:00:27.966
But she doesn't seem to want to be with me.

13
00:00:28.766 --> 00:00:30.400
What do you want me to do for you?

14
00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.766
But let me say it first

15
00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.966
Your own wife, you have to chase it yourself

16
00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.200
I can't help you much

17
00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.600
Grandma, Seven

18
00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.500
Is the divorce difficult?

19
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.433
Hangjiang doesn't want to leave again

20
00:00:48.733 --> 00:00:50.166
But don't worry, grandma.

21
00:00:50.333 --> 00:00:51.866
Whether he wants to leave or not

22
00:00:51.966 --> 00:00:53.600
It won't affect our lives

23
00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.166
Xiaojiang, did he say why he didn't get a divorce?

24
00:00:56.166 --> 00:00:58.666
Something must have happened in between

25
00:00:58.766 --> 00:01:00.066
Didn't say why

26
00:01:00.066 --> 00:01:03.266
Xiaoqing, although we are not locals of Xiangjiang

27
00:01:03.266 --> 00:01:05.600
You don't have your parents to support you

28
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.133
But milk milk

29
00:01:07.133 --> 00:01:09.033
As long as grandma has this tone

30
00:01:09.466 --> 00:01:13.266
I will never let the little bastard ask the boy to do anything wrong

31
00:01:14.566 --> 00:01:16.333
I'm going to call your grandmother

32
00:01:16.333 --> 00:01:17.500
Ask for an explanation

33
00:01:17.566 --> 00:01:20.100
His grandmother's grandson is a baby

34
00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.266
But my little green

35
00:01:21.266 --> 00:01:24.066
The grandson of the huge baby in my palm

36
00:01:24.366 --> 00:01:25.800
Shulin is right

37
00:01:26.166 --> 00:01:27.066
This thing

38
00:01:27.066 --> 00:01:29.500
I will definitely give you and Xiaoqing an explanation.

39
00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.800
Good grandma, this expert is really not a person

40
00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.100
He was the one who wanted the divorce

41
00:01:35.166 --> 00:01:36.733
Not leaving now

42
00:01:36.733 --> 00:01:38.200
What is he when Xiao Qi?

43
00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:39.766
This little bastard

44
00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.400
If I ever see him again

45
00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.633
I had to break his leg.

46
00:01:44.166 --> 00:01:45.366
I'm pissed off.

47
00:01:45.366 --> 00:01:47.000
I'm really pissed off.

48
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.700
Xiaoxin, don't worry.

49
00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.200
Don't be angry about your identity.

50
00:01:51.333 --> 00:01:53.700
Woods I know you are soft-hearted

51
00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.166
I can't take advantage of your kindness

52
00:01:56.166 --> 00:01:58.833
Let this go.

53
00:02:02.533 --> 00:02:03.333
woods

54
00:02:03.933 --> 00:02:06.266
Why don't you pack your things?

55
00:02:06.266 --> 00:02:08.866
Now go to Nanshan with me to recuperate

56
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.900
Let's pay that brat back all his money
