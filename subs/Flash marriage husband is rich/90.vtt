00:00:02.133 --> 00:00:04.800
Mr. Huang, I can handle the divorce procedures here.

2
00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.800
When will the appointment be made?

3
00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:12.466
Miss Si

4
00:00:12.466 --> 00:00:15.100
Tomorrow at 2 p.m. Longhua District Marriage Registry

5
00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:17.366
Bring your household registration ID card and marriage certificate

6
00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:18.966
Hope you can be on time this time.

7
00:00:22.666 --> 00:00:25.400
Grandma, you have a good rest first.

8
00:00:25.533 --> 00:00:27.566
Remember to call me if you have anything

9
00:00:27.566 --> 00:00:29.566
I have to go back and look for my marriage license first

10
00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:35.200
old lady

11
00:00:35.733 --> 00:00:38.300
Your grandson-in-law is not an ordinary person at first glance

12
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.800
It's a pity to leave us like this

13
00:00:40.866 --> 00:00:42.766
Why not ordinary people?

14
00:00:42.933 --> 00:00:45.266
The most important thing is that I'm stingy and happy

15
00:00:45.666 --> 00:00:47.200
Quick, quick, front and rear rows, front and rear rows

16
00:00:47.733 --> 00:00:49.366
Jindu attacked your high skills

17
00:00:50.766 --> 00:00:51.566
Ah!

18
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:54.500
Your grandma must have divorced, I can get a divorce

19
00:00:54.566 --> 00:00:56.100
Hurry up and help me find a marriage certificate

20
00:00:58.533 --> 00:00:59.566
Then you have to find it.

21
00:00:59.566 --> 00:01:02.466
Absolutely 30 to find the ID card?

22
00:01:03.533 --> 00:01:06.166
You didn't throw it away as trash, did you?

23
00:01:06.566 --> 00:01:08.033
I've never seen your marriage certificate

24
00:01:08.333 --> 00:01:09.700
Did you take it home?

25
00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:14.000
If there is no marriage certificate, can you still get a divorce?

26
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.233
I'll check it for you.

27
00:01:15.766 --> 00:01:16.566
Hey

28
00:01:21.766 --> 00:01:22.566
Hey

29
00:01:22.933 --> 00:01:25.666
This class said that it doesn't matter if your marriage certificate is gone.

30
00:01:25.666 --> 00:01:28.533
The dog man's marriage certificate is still there, hahaha?

31
00:01:28.533 --> 00:01:29.933
Okay, okay, that's fine

32
00:01:29.933 --> 00:01:30.533
Scared me to death

33
00:01:30.533 --> 00:01:32.366
I thought I couldn't leave again this time

34
00:01:32.366 --> 00:01:33.800
When are you going to go through the formalities?

35
00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.266
We both go with you

36
00:01:35.333 --> 00:01:38.166
I'll give you a good day then.

37
00:01:38.666 --> 00:01:40.900
Don't, don't, let's get a divorce

38
00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.600
Yo 4,000 what's so happy about

39
00:01:47.333 --> 00:01:48.666
Is it that obvious?

40
00:01:48.666 --> 00:01:50.166
Of course.

41
00:01:50.966 --> 00:01:52.766
You're not pregnant, are you?

42
00:01:52.766 --> 00:01:53.700
Hey

43
00:01:53.733 --> 00:01:57.200
I'm sort of the modern equivalent of the big three.

44
00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:58.166
By the way, Mr. Zheng

45
00:01:58.166 --> 00:01:59.866
I have something to do this afternoon

46
00:01:59.866 --> 00:02:01.033
Can you take half a day off?

47
00:02:06.533 --> 00:02:08.600
You both rest in the afternoon

48
00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.466
Walk away and give me a vacation

49
00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:12.266
Don't you let it go?

50
00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.300
No no no no

51
00:02:25.166 --> 00:02:25.966
white sugar

52
00:02:26.866 --> 00:02:28.600
Your wife is really surprised this time

53
00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.900
It seems that I have been waiting for a long time.

54
00:02:30.966 --> 00:02:32.200
What happened to Siqing?
