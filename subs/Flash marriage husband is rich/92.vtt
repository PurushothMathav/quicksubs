00:00:00.733 --> 00:00:02.233
Let you go you go

2
00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:11.933
Ms. Lin, what about Hangjiang people?

3
00:00:11.933 --> 00:00:16.466
Uh, Mr. Hang said he doesn't want to divorce this marriage

4
00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.233
Are you kidding?

5
00:00:18.266 --> 00:00:19.400
Are you kidding me?

6
00:00:19.533 --> 00:00:22.966
One person at a time is considered an adult

7
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.333
Isn't he childish?

8
00:00:25.333 --> 00:00:26.900
Is divorce a joke?

9
00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.766
Ah, why don't you go back first?

10
00:00:30.766 --> 00:00:33.000
I'll let you know when he wants a divorce another day.

11
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.766
Hey, no, it's not that I missed my appointment before.

12
00:00:35.766 --> 00:00:36.533
It's my fault

13
00:00:36.533 --> 00:00:39.066
Then this time he broke the appointment too, so we're even

14
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.300
Then can you not ask him?

15
00:00:41.333 --> 00:00:42.166
When do you have time?

16
00:00:42.166 --> 00:00:44.900
Let's make an appointment tomorrow or the day after tomorrow?

17
00:00:46.766 --> 00:00:49.100
It depends on Mr. Xing's mood

18
00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:50.800
He was the one who said divorce before

19
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.200
Now he's not leaving what the hell?

20
00:00:53.333 --> 00:00:56.100
Yeah he's a thing

21
00:00:56.533 --> 00:00:58.766
Don't bother with this thing

22
00:00:59.066 --> 00:01:01.766
Anyway, are you two married the same?

23
00:01:01.766 --> 00:01:03.633
You should have a boyfriend

24
00:01:10.466 --> 00:01:12.200
You know he's in trouble

25
00:01:12.366 --> 00:01:13.500
Two more people.

26
00:01:14.266 --> 00:01:15.233
I ask you

27
00:01:15.366 --> 00:01:17.600
What are the three blessings of modern life?

28
00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:21.200
Male version of promotion and fortune dead brother

29
00:01:21.333 --> 00:01:24.266
Female version of promotion and salary increase dead husband

30
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:26.800
cousin

31
00:01:27.166 --> 00:01:29.666
Private messages can't die at work

32
00:01:30.166 --> 00:01:31.100
Because I want to be with you
