00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.833
Grandma, take care of your children

2
00:00:05.866 --> 00:00:07.166
Are we still young?

3
00:00:07.166 --> 00:00:09.666
Hangjiang is 28 years old

4
00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:11.366
In a few days

5
00:00:11.366 --> 00:00:15.000
You will be 24 years old

6
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.066
Grandma, trust me.

7
00:00:16.066 --> 00:00:19.566
The grandson of a good friend is not much worse

8
00:00:19.566 --> 00:00:23.400
But man's biological nature, his playfulness

9
00:00:23.566 --> 00:00:25.900
You had a baby early

10
00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:27.500
Reassure him

11
00:00:29.266 --> 00:00:30.066
It's getting late

12
00:00:30.066 --> 00:00:31.366
You should rest early.

13
00:00:31.366 --> 00:00:32.266
It's getting late

14
00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.233
Do you think we are nosy?

15
00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.033
It's your mother and you too

16
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.900
I live with my child Anton and my father-in-law as husband and wife

17
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:41.066
And company related

18
00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.900
Grandma, look what you introduced to me.

19
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:48.500
I just got promoted less than half a year ago

20
00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.166
Running around with my boss every day

21
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.400
You can't do this when you're idle

22
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:54.733
You're right, too.

23
00:00:54.733 --> 00:00:56.066
This family?

24
00:00:56.133 --> 00:00:57.566
Of course it is important

25
00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.700
But the girl's house

26
00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.666
You have to have your own business

27
00:01:01.933 --> 00:01:03.466
You can still make money.

28
00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.666
Only at home has the voice over

29
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.700
Yes, grandma, look at you

30
00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.000
As expected of burning yourself

31
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.333
The People's Teacher Who Illuminates Others

32
00:01:10.333 --> 00:01:11.800
It's mentally transparent

33
00:01:12.466 --> 00:01:13.266
Right?

34
00:01:20.933 --> 00:01:23.066
Miss Si, what do you want to do?

35
00:01:23.066 --> 00:01:24.033
Lawyer Lin

36
00:01:24.066 --> 00:01:26.766
Could you please tell Mr. Huang?

37
00:01:26.766 --> 00:01:28.833
I can't go to a lawyer for the time being

38
00:01:32.166 --> 00:01:34.766
Miss Sun, we can't be untrustworthy, right?

39
00:01:34.766 --> 00:01:35.966
The divorce agreement was also signed

40
00:01:35.966 --> 00:01:37.900
We agreed to go through the divorce formalities today

41
00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:39.500
Why did you return to me?

42
00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:40.466
Not ignoring me

43
00:01:40.466 --> 00:01:42.866
It's just a temporary step back, okay?

44
00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.666
Why are you stepping back?

45
00:01:44.666 --> 00:01:46.300
My grandma is sick.

46
00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.666
He talks about his grandson-in-law every day now

47
00:01:48.733 --> 00:01:50.366
If I tell him to divorce now

48
00:01:50.366 --> 00:01:52.200
I'm afraid my body can't take it

49
00:01:52.566 --> 00:01:55.333
I just want to wait for grandma to get better

50
00:01:55.333 --> 00:01:56.566
I'll go through the formalities again
