00:00:01.066 --> 00:00:01.766
What are you doing?

2
00:00:01.766 --> 00:00:03.500
What are you doing?

3
00:00:04.133 --> 00:00:05.400
Let go of me who are you

4
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:06.833
Do I know who the hell?

5
00:00:07.066 --> 00:00:08.033
Several young masters

6
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:09.066
I'm sorry.

7
00:00:09.566 --> 00:00:11.333
The governor's wife herself gave the order

8
00:00:11.333 --> 00:00:12.900
We also do things by collar

9
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.933
Madam Governor, why did he arrest me?

10
00:00:16.933 --> 00:00:18.566
Then you have to ask him.

11
00:00:18.566 --> 00:00:20.233
But don't worry, young masters

12
00:00:20.533 --> 00:00:21.800
If you don't fight back

13
00:00:21.866 --> 00:00:23.233
I won't hurt you either

14
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:27.800
kill

15
00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:30.300
Don't move don't move

16
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.200
Or I'll kill him

17
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.200
Sir, calm down.

18
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.133
Let go of Miss Mu first

19
00:00:35.133 --> 00:00:38.033
If you have something to say, let's talk about it. I told you not to come here.

20
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:42.500
Calm down

21
00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:43.866
I asked you to refund the number.

22
00:00:45.866 --> 00:00:46.700
step back

23
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.333
To save your useless daughter

24
00:00:53.333 --> 00:00:55.166
You are really reckless

25
00:00:55.166 --> 00:00:55.966
Humph

26
00:00:55.966 --> 00:00:58.633
Red refers to all the celebrities and the powerful as the body

27
00:00:58.666 --> 00:01:01.500
You even dare to do General Ye's general ceremony

28
00:01:02.466 --> 00:01:03.433
You have the guts

29
00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.133
I do admire you a little

30
00:01:06.133 --> 00:01:07.466
Hand over Qinghe

31
00:01:07.933 --> 00:01:09.533
It's your last chance.

32
00:01:09.533 --> 00:01:10.800
It's two o'clock.

33
00:01:11.366 --> 00:01:13.766
My brother and General Ye will be here soon

34
00:01:13.866 --> 00:01:15.833
Why are you in a hurry?

35
00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.900
If you have the ability, continue to sit and don't get up

36
00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.600
I'm going to wait and see what happens to you

37
00:01:22.966 --> 00:01:24.566
I'm waiting to see too

38
00:01:25.466 --> 00:01:27.266
Queen's decree shall not be humiliated

39
00:01:27.666 --> 00:01:30.266
Queen, you hum

40
00:01:30.266 --> 00:01:33.466
Wake up and stop dreaming about spring and autumn

41
00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:34.766
Can't be humiliated, right?

42
00:01:34.766 --> 00:01:35.566
na

43
00:01:35.766 --> 00:01:37.100
I'm humiliated

44
00:01:37.266 --> 00:01:39.100
How about you bite me?

45
00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:40.700
Aren't you pretty good at fighting?

46
00:01:40.733 --> 00:01:42.900
Governor to

47
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.833
General Night arrives
