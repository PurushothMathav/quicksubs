1
00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:03.666
You stay

2
00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:05.300
What do you mean?

3
00:00:05.333 --> 00:00:07.333
Miss Li, please don't take offense.

4
00:00:07.333 --> 00:00:09.366
This is the rule set by Kameda-san

5
00:00:09.366 --> 00:00:11.133
Anyone who meets him for the first time

6
00:00:11.133 --> 00:00:12.833
You have to cover your eyes.

7
00:00:14.166 --> 00:00:15.266
You don't trust me.

8
00:00:15.266 --> 00:00:17.333
Worried that I would reveal the whereabouts of Taikun Guida

9
00:00:17.333 --> 00:00:18.466
Not afraid of ten thousand

10
00:00:18.466 --> 00:00:19.633
Just in case

11
00:00:19.766 --> 00:00:20.700
Gui Tian talks about relationships

12
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:22.966
The top agent of our great Russian nation

13
00:00:23.266 --> 00:00:25.200
He was able to stand tall in Nanjing

14
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.400
He is very rigorous in his work

15
00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.200
Ok, I'll take it.

16
00:00:32.466 --> 00:00:35.700
Hahaha, that's right, right?

17
00:00:36.166 --> 00:00:37.333
Meet Chief Kameda

18
00:00:37.333 --> 00:00:39.366
This is the final test for Miss Lin

19
00:00:39.366 --> 00:00:42.000
If Miss Lin can be with Chief Kameda

20
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:42.933
be recognized

21
00:00:42.933 --> 00:00:44.800
That will have a great future

22
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.966
How are you? Are you home?

23
00:00:56.966 --> 00:00:58.833
Luo Jiazuo, sorry

24
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.666
I'm not afraid your son will never come home again

25
00:01:19.566 --> 00:01:21.666
Please get out of the car
