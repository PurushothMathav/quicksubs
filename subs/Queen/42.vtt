1
00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:02.300
Luo Yongjiang is their man

2
00:00:03.533 --> 00:00:05.766
This old fox is hiding too deep

3
00:00:05.766 --> 00:00:07.466
Mr. Su personally took action

4
00:00:07.466 --> 00:00:08.800
Failed to get the handle on him

5
00:00:09.933 --> 00:00:11.633
Fortunately, the Queen has a discerning eye

6
00:00:11.766 --> 00:00:13.000
See through his disguise

7
00:00:13.266 --> 00:00:14.266
The ability of thieves to penetrate

8
00:00:14.266 --> 00:00:16.100
It's beyond our imagination.

9
00:00:16.733 --> 00:00:18.100
The more at this time

10
00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:19.566
The more we have to keep our eyes open

11
00:00:19.566 --> 00:00:21.900
Spies are probably lurking around us

12
00:00:22.766 --> 00:00:23.900
Lord Wang

13
00:00:24.333 --> 00:00:26.133
You obviously can't hold his arms anymore

14
00:00:26.133 --> 00:00:28.266
And knowing that the abandoned warehouse in the western suburbs in the early morning

15
00:00:28.266 --> 00:00:29.200
It's a trap

16
00:00:29.366 --> 00:00:31.900
Then why didn't you arrest him just now?

17
00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:33.166
But to commit evil

18
00:00:33.733 --> 00:00:35.400
Let him drop our tracks

19
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:36.566
Do not enter the tiger's den

20
00:00:36.566 --> 00:00:37.600
What a tiger

21
00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.333
Our target is Gozo Kameda

22
00:00:39.333 --> 00:00:41.566
And not a little Taro Watanabe

23
00:00:41.566 --> 00:00:43.800
Rash action will only kill grass and worms

24
00:00:43.966 --> 00:00:45.033
I see.

25
00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:47.133
Queen, do you want to save it?

26
00:00:47.133 --> 00:00:48.200
take this as your child

27
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:48.866
call up

28
00:00:48.866 --> 00:00:51.200
Gozo Kameda, who has been controlling everything behind the scenes

29
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.766
A good hunter takes the form of prey.

30
00:00:54.366 --> 00:00:56.466
We must make Kameda's five internal organs feel

31
00:00:56.466 --> 00:00:57.766
He's already winning

32
00:00:57.766 --> 00:00:59.033
I'm pretty sure.

33
00:00:59.266 --> 00:01:01.500
This old fox will let his guard down

34
00:01:01.933 --> 00:01:04.000
Show your fox tail

35
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:05.833
The Queen is wise

36
00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:11.500
Her Majesty the Queen

37
00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.766
Please condescend to stay here tonight

38
00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:15.500
I'll pick you up tomorrow morning.

39
00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.466
Let's go to the airplane warehouse in the western suburbs in the early morning.

40
00:01:26.333 --> 00:01:27.300
Guitian Taijun

41
00:01:27.466 --> 00:01:28.300
Everything went well.

42
00:01:28.466 --> 00:01:29.366
Can be registered.

43
00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.466
He saw through Luo Yongjiang's identity

44
00:01:31.466 --> 00:01:33.966
I want to guide you down the mountain
