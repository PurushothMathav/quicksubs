Command the world

6
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:13.800
Don't dare to obey

7
00:00:14.333 --> 00:00:16.466
Don't you want to know the truth of the pastor's sister?

8
00:00:16.466 --> 00:00:17.600
Real identity?

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.033

10
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.300

Thief

17
00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:42.900
Senior sister

18
00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:46.500
Don't kneel

19
00:00:47.566 --> 00:00:51.033
The Governor of Red Dust, Sun Jihai, visits the Queen

20
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.500
Meet the Queen

21
00:00:56.733 --> 00:00:58.766
Meet the Queen

22
00:00:59.366 --> 00:01:00.900
I was blind just now

28
00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.333
Sun Jihai is there

29
00:01:11.333 --> 00:01:12.433
You handle it

30
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:13.400
Yes!

31
00:01:14.066 --> 00:01:14.866
Wei Yang

32
00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:16.800
Why hasn't Qinghe come down yet?

33
00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:17.700
Sister, don't worry.

34
00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.066
I'll go up and see for myself

35
00:01:20.133 --> 00:01:21.066
Don't move, don't come

36
00:01:21.066 --> 00:01:22.833
Don't move, step back, step back

38
00:01:25.866 --> 00:01:27.500
Searching for the only way out of this dormitory

39
00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.200
I'm going your way out

40
00:01:29.266 --> 00:01:31.100
Now that you've discovered me and Kameda

41
00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:32.200
Tae-hoon's plan

42
00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.700
Leaving the city is my only way out

43
00:01:34.933 --> 00:01:35.966
Now.

44
00:01:36.533 --> 00:01:38.400
Let me go or else

45
00:01:38.933 --> 00:01:40.100

Let him be buried with me
