1
00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:01.866
How is this possible?

2
00:00:02.133 --> 00:00:03.666
There is no difference in you

3
00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:05.466
I don't know for the sake of implementation

4
00:00:05.533 --> 00:00:08.033
I'll give you a chance to make amends

5
00:00:08.133 --> 00:00:10.466
You ask your son to speak up and implement

6
00:00:10.533 --> 00:00:14.100
Answer any questions the emperor asks truthfully

7
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:15.033
otherwise

8
00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:19.733
Your Luo family has all disappeared in Jiangcheng

9
00:00:19.733 --> 00:00:20.766
delist

10
00:00:21.466 --> 00:00:23.500
Letter to thank the main belt

11
00:00:25.066 --> 00:00:28.766
My bad son actually colluded with thieves behind my back

12
00:00:29.133 --> 00:00:30.833
Killed our entire family

13
00:00:31.166 --> 00:00:34.166
It's a sin to get on your knees

14
00:00:35.766 --> 00:00:37.800
Answer the Queen's question well

15
00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:39.200
There is a reluctant sentence

16
00:00:39.333 --> 00:00:41.766
I personally peeled your skin today

17
00:00:44.066 --> 00:00:46.300
I joined the Yamaguchi team six months ago

18
00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:47.666
I am mainly responsible for collecting

19
00:00:47.966 --> 00:00:49.200
Early morning families

20
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.300
And the private information of the dying elite

21
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.833
He helped them launder money.

22
00:00:54.166 --> 00:00:56.133
You can get 15% commission

23
00:00:56.133 --> 00:00:58.366
I rely on the inverse

24
00:00:58.666 --> 00:00:59.200
Kneel and lick Taijun

25
00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:00.266
Tell me

26
00:01:00.266 --> 00:01:02.300
If you fill 10 relatives, family or right of dying

27
00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.166
If you are expensive, please stop and pull the Governor off his horse

28
00:01:05.166 --> 00:01:07.600
Let me take charge of Jinchen instead

29
00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.366
You can believe what a thief says

30
00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:10.866
What an idiot

31
00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.766
How did I give birth to such a useless son as you?

32
00:01:14.166 --> 00:01:16.366
Another Chen Hui said

33
00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:18.166
Where is Takeshi Kameda?

34
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:20.766
I don't know.

35
00:01:20.766 --> 00:01:21.966
I really don't know.

36
00:01:21.966 --> 00:01:23.800
I've always been contacted by mobile phone.

37
00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:25.566
I haven't seen him.

38
00:01:25.766 --> 00:01:27.433
Who brought you in?

39
00:01:27.766 --> 00:01:29.600
I used to gamble in casinos

40
00:01:30.066 --> 00:01:31.400
Lost 30 million

41
00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.200
A Wo man found me

42
00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.666
Say I work for him

43
00:01:34.666 --> 00:01:36.766
Can help me pay off this 30 million debt

44
00:01:37.166 --> 00:01:39.500
What are the Japanese called?

45
00:01:40.966 --> 00:01:42.466
