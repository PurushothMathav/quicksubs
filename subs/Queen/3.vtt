00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:05.400
Who the hell are you?

2
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:06.766
What is the relationship with Qinghe?

3
00:00:06.766 --> 00:00:08.400
I am Qinghe's aunt

4
00:00:08.566 --> 00:00:09.766
aunt

5
00:00:10.666 --> 00:00:13.100
How come I've never seen you before?

6
00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:16.033
Qinghe never said that he had an aunt

7
00:00:22.366 --> 00:00:25.566
Qinghe won't let me tell anyone about him

8
00:00:25.566 --> 00:00:26.966
Especially his mother

9
00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.700
Chen Jiasheng

10
00:00:28.733 --> 00:00:30.833
Chen Hui's uncle is also the Governor of Red Dust

11
00:00:30.933 --> 00:00:33.100
In the red dust, it can be said to cover the sky with one hand

12
00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:34.100
Don't be afraid.

13
00:00:34.366 --> 00:00:35.333
Just say it.

14
00:00:35.333 --> 00:00:39.300
But the governor of Hongcheng saw us, General Ye

15
00:00:39.333 --> 00:00:40.700
Only worthy of kneeling and talking

16
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.933
Really, then you

17
00:00:42.933 --> 00:00:45.833
I said I'm Qinghe's aunt

18
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.366
If Qinghe suffered any grievances in the Chen family

19
00:00:49.366 --> 00:00:51.666
I will definitely fall for his peach tree

20
00:00:52.266 --> 00:00:54.166
Ok I tell you

21
00:00:57.166 --> 00:00:58.400
See for yourself

22
00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.166
You must save Qinghe

23
00:01:00.166 --> 00:01:02.366
He is so pitiful.

24
00:01:02.366 --> 00:01:04.633
That Chen Hui is a beast

25
00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:06.766
Sun Shangxiang is a devil

26
00:01:07.066 --> 00:01:08.500
Since marriage

27
00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.300
Chen Hui and Sun Shangxiang scolded him if they didn't agree with each other

28
00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.600
The injuries on his body are simply too numerous to count

29
00:01:14.666 --> 00:01:16.233
But even so

30
00:01:16.333 --> 00:01:18.766
Are you afraid that you will implicate Aunt Mu?

31
00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.233
So he never dared to tell anyone

32
00:01:22.366 --> 00:01:24.233
You have to endure it even if you grit your teeth

33
00:01:25.466 --> 00:01:26.866
Goddamn thing

34
00:01:28.966 --> 00:01:31.633
Hui's company is in a bit of trouble

35
00:01:32.266 --> 00:01:33.966
He has been in a bad mood recently.

36
00:01:33.966 --> 00:01:37.566
I accidentally touched Qinghe's blood while mopping the floor

37
00:01:37.666 --> 00:01:41.000
He relentlessly slapped Xiaohui a few times

38
00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.066
Xiaohui's hair hit the table

39
00:01:44.066 --> 00:01:45.466
There was a lot of blood

40
00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.433
Is Qinghe like this?
