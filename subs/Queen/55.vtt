1
00:00:02.466 --> 00:00:04.466
General Ye searched the entire warehouse

2
00:00:04.466 --> 00:00:06.266
I didn't find the pastor's sister and the roadside taro

3
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:09.566
What just happened in here?

4
00:00:13.066 --> 00:00:15.866
Governor Su, how is the situation on your side?

5
00:00:15.866 --> 00:00:18.800
I captured Luo Zhong according to the orders of the Queen

6
00:00:18.866 --> 00:00:20.366
Controlled Luo Yongjiang

7
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:21.666
Luo Yongjiang to save his life

8
00:00:21.666 --> 00:00:23.700
Provides a very important clue

9
00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:27.766
He said that Lin Jing, the rich general by Ye Jiangzhi's side

10
00:00:27.966 --> 00:00:29.400
It's a thief's spy

11
00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.833
What? Can you say that again?

12
00:00:31.866 --> 00:00:33.166
Lin Jing is a spy

13
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.666
He attacked the ruined warehouse

14
00:00:35.933 --> 00:00:37.633
Seriously injured the queen

15
00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:40.633
As a result, the Queen was captured alive by Taro Watanabe

16
00:00:41.333 --> 00:00:44.066
Taro Watanabe should now bring the Queen

17
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.000
I went to see the turtle tianwu battle

18
00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.266
Bastard General Ye

19
00:00:48.266 --> 00:00:49.200
What's wrong?

20
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.366
The world is in danger

21
00:00:50.366 --> 00:00:51.700
Leave with me now

22
00:00:51.766 --> 00:00:52.733
Go after Taro Watanabe

23
00:00:52.733 --> 00:00:54.400
That dog thing is

24
00:00:55.766 --> 00:00:57.466
General Yi, what about those squid?

25
00:00:57.466 --> 00:00:58.866
Thieves mess up my southern border

26
00:00:58.866 --> 00:01:00.733
In vain, my heart of Great Xia will not die

27
00:01:00.733 --> 00:01:03.200
Everyone gets killed

28
00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:04.366
Not a single one
