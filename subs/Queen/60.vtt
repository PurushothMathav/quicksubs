00:00:02.733 --> 00:00:04.466
Miss Mi

2
00:00:04.866 --> 00:00:07.900
The first master of the Yamaguchi team is nothing more than that

3
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.300
When you received my information

4
00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:11.533
It's you who led the ninja

5
00:00:11.533 --> 00:00:13.400
Do your best to serve my master

6
00:00:13.533 --> 00:00:15.266
Knock my master off the cliff

7
00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:16.966
He also gave my master a knife

8
00:00:17.366 --> 00:00:20.366
Now I will return this knife to your lawyer

9
00:00:20.366 --> 00:00:21.966
Come hit me

10
00:00:21.966 --> 00:00:24.166
That's right, you burglars

11
00:00:24.166 --> 00:00:24.933
It's messy.

12
00:00:24.933 --> 00:00:25.966
Spare my size

13
00:00:26.133 --> 00:00:27.366
All damn

14
00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:30.500
You are a spy

15
00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.233
You are a spy sent by Life Like Electricity

16
00:00:33.766 --> 00:00:35.400
To gain your trust

17
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:36.900
Find your elders

18
00:00:36.933 --> 00:00:39.566
At first, you contacted me privately and wanted to buy it.

19
00:00:39.966 --> 00:00:41.300
I told the master

20
00:00:41.566 --> 00:00:43.400
Master is willing to risk his life

21
00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:44.800
See yourself as a temptation

22
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.100
Yes, we join your conspiracy

23
00:00:47.566 --> 00:00:50.300
So you put him in the water

24
00:00:50.366 --> 00:00:51.466
There is no software at all.

25
00:00:51.466 --> 00:00:52.500
thing

26
00:00:53.066 --> 00:00:54.800
Gui Tian Musashi Criminal Prudence

27
00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.633
Didn't go to the abandoned warehouse in person

28
00:00:57.166 --> 00:00:59.733
Approaching and stabbing me according to my plan

29
00:00:59.733 --> 00:01:00.633
Turn against me

30
00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.700
That's what I'm talking about.

31
00:01:04.566 --> 00:01:06.600
Pity you fools

32
00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:08.833
They think they have everything under control

33
00:01:09.166 --> 00:01:10.966
Still showing off here

34
00:01:10.966 --> 00:01:12.200
complacency

35
00:01:12.733 --> 00:01:14.900
Baga Baga

36
00:01:15.566 --> 00:01:17.800
You have no martial arts ethics
