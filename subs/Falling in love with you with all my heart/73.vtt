1
00:00:05.533 --> 00:00:09.100
It's you, I have drawn a line with Shen Tinglan

2
00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:12.400
It doesn't seem appropriate for you to invite me over.

3
00:00:13.066 --> 00:00:13.500
Qinglan

4
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.100
This kid didn't tell you the truth after all.

5
00:00:17.666 --> 00:00:20.366
I don't care if it's true or not

6
00:00:20.366 --> 00:00:22.900
I'll try it myself about my parents

7
00:00:23.333 --> 00:00:24.966
You don't have to spend money.

8
00:00:24.966 --> 00:00:27.300
Wait kid

9
00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.700
Look at this.

10
00:00:33.866 --> 00:00:34.966
Here it is.

11
00:00:35.566 --> 00:00:37.200
Little mute looks up

12
00:00:39.066 --> 00:00:40.033
Little dumb

13
00:00:41.066 --> 00:00:43.433
Why is this photo with you?

14
00:00:43.566 --> 00:00:47.233
This is the sky blue ten years ago

15
00:00:48.266 --> 00:00:50.600
You said this is Shen Tianlan.

16
00:00:55.133 --> 00:00:58.600
His mother died of illness that year

17
00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:03.700
His father sent six-year-old Tiran abroad

18
00:01:03.733 --> 00:01:06.200
Let him fend for himself

19
00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.966
I was in the company

20
00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.166
I don't care much about him

21
00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.366
But this is similar to the current Shen Tianmen

22
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.166
Completely different.

23
00:01:17.666 --> 00:01:21.666
He had bipolar disorder.

24
00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.700
And anxiety.
