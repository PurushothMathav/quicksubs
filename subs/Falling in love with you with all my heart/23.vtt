00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.233
Guess who I am?

2
00:00:06.533 --> 00:00:07.466
You you

3
00:00:08.566 --> 00:00:09.366
Ah!

4
00:00:12.466 --> 00:00:13.900
Where else do you want to run?

5
00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:16.866
If someone pays, please return it. You can't escape

6
00:00:16.866 --> 00:00:19.033
Baby keep double the debt

7
00:00:19.533 --> 00:00:21.900
Well I know you let me go

8
00:00:22.133 --> 00:00:23.600
People told me

9
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.200
You're broke now

10
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:29.200
Mom and Dad are dead quiet, do you have any money?

11
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.100
OK

12
00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.466
Do you still want to call?

13
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:39.300
Baby

14
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.233
I will be gentle

15
00:00:42.866 --> 00:00:44.800
Hey.

16
00:00:46.166 --> 00:00:46.966
Ah!

17
00:01:01.566 --> 00:01:03.500
Is it important for Sky Blue to save lives?

18
00:01:03.666 --> 00:01:04.966
Who are you?

19
00:01:05.066 --> 00:01:06.800
I don't want to see this person in the clouds

20
00:01:07.266 --> 00:01:09.633
What the hell is going on? Who are you?

21
00:01:09.666 --> 00:01:11.600
I don't have any hands either.

22
00:01:13.333 --> 00:01:15.266
Be careful! Be careful!
