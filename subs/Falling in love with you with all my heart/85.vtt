1
00:00:01.766 --> 00:00:02.800
Pardon me?

2
00:00:03.533 --> 00:00:05.366
The Xu Group went bankrupt

3
00:00:05.733 --> 00:00:07.166
And why would he do that?

4
00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:08.900
Work with me.

5
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.300
I'll tell you what

6
00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:12.433
Hum and you

7
00:00:12.666 --> 00:00:14.733
And a man who beat his own father to the hospital

8
00:00:14.733 --> 00:00:16.200
Who am I?

9
00:00:16.566 --> 00:00:19.766
Oops, this is except for me

10
00:00:19.766 --> 00:00:22.300
No fourth person knows the truth of that year

11
00:00:22.533 --> 00:00:24.266
You can only cooperate with me.

12
00:00:24.366 --> 00:00:25.666
There was no other way.

13
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:29.566
How to cooperate

14
00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:34.300
This is the key to Shen Tinglan's study

15
00:00:34.466 --> 00:00:36.700
Tomorrow from 3 to 4 pm.

16
00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:38.233
The old man has surgery

17
00:00:38.466 --> 00:00:39.600
No one's home.

18
00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.500
I need you to get something for me

19
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.266
What's that?

20
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.200
Let you get it for me

21
00:00:46.966 --> 00:00:48.966
Confidential documents of Huanyu Group

22
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:53.833
I can't do that.

23
00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:58.633
Three years ago.

24
00:00:58.766 --> 00:01:01.166
Your parents had a wiggle fund

25
00:01:01.166 --> 00:01:02.566
Ready for Century

26
00:01:02.566 --> 00:01:04.100
Nearly 80 million

27
00:01:04.533 --> 00:01:08.000
But after Huaiyu Group settled in Yuncheng

28
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.433
The money is gone

29
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.100
How do you know?

30
00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:14.600
Work with me.

31
00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.033
I'll tell you all about it.

32
00:01:26.366 --> 00:01:27.433
Don't blame me for being cruel
