1
00:00:05.666 --> 00:00:07.966
Mr. Shen, what about me?

2
00:00:07.966 --> 00:00:10.100
Just an irrelevant woman

3
00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:12.800
It's not worth Mr. Shen being so angry

4
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.966
Don't let me see you so casually

5
00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:22.400
roll

6
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:25.700
You're in love with him.

7
00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:27.500
In order not to let myself get deeper and deeper

8
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.100
I would be afraid to stay away from him

9
00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:30.633
Am I right?

10
00:00:35.866 --> 00:00:37.466
If Mr. Shen regrets it

11
00:00:37.466 --> 00:00:39.033
You can contact me anytime.

12
00:00:39.566 --> 00:00:41.233
But my price is expensive.

13
00:00:42.066 --> 00:00:44.200
You know wait

14
00:00:48.266 --> 00:00:49.966
A woman like you is quite nice

15
00:00:50.266 --> 00:00:52.066
At least not in the interest of true love

16
00:00:52.733 --> 00:00:53.866
Keep entangling

17
00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:57.666
Mr. Shen

18
00:00:58.333 --> 00:01:00.033
I can only cling to you

19
00:01:00.866 --> 00:01:02.066
Don't ask questions

20
00:01:02.366 --> 00:01:03.966
Then make me a deal

21
00:01:04.266 --> 00:01:05.600
I need a fiancee

22
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.400
Come and block my family's marriage urging

23
00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:11.666
You can mention the conditions at will.

24
00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:18.300
Help me find the truth about Xu's bankruptcy three years ago

25
00:01:19.666 --> 00:01:20.466
It's a deal!

26
00:01:21.466 --> 00:01:22.500
And money

27
00:01:23.366 --> 00:01:25.033
A lot of money.

28
00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:35.400
So

29
00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.366
That's how you and my uncle made a deal
