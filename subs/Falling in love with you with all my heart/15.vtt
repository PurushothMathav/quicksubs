You are giving him a chance.

13
00:00:40.666 --> 00:00:42.200
You don't have to go around so many corners.

How did you become Miss Xu?

17
00:00:49.566 --> 00:00:51.833
Is Mr. Shen crazy?

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.633
Shen heard what exactly do you want to do?

26
00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.233
Thank you Mr. Shen for your trust

27
00:01:14.333 --> 00:01:16.033

32
00:01:33.866 --> 00:01:37.200
I remember my major was hidden from everyone

33
00:01:37.466 --> 00:01:39.900
Unless you knew me in college

34
00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.766
It does look familiar

35
00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:49.900
You got the wrong person.
