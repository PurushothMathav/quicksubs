1
00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:01.366
Don't get up too early.

2
00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:02.900
I don't think we know each other.

3
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.466
I haven't even told you what year I graduated.

4
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.400
Girl, what industry do your parents do?

5
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.333
My parents passed away three years ago

6
00:00:13.333 --> 00:00:16.900
However, the company they ran before their death, the Xu Group

7
00:00:16.933 --> 00:00:19.066
You may have heard of Xu Xi

8
00:00:20.333 --> 00:00:21.133
Grandpa

9
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:22.933
I have something else to do

10
00:00:22.933 --> 00:00:24.766
I'll take Xu Xi away first

11
00:00:24.766 --> 00:00:25.600
And so forth.

12
00:00:26.466 --> 00:00:27.866
Come here.

13
00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:30.666
You wait for me here.

14
00:00:30.766 --> 00:00:32.266
I'll come back to you later.

15
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.800
That's what you're doing

16
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.666
Go to Yuncheng

17
00:00:38.733 --> 00:00:41.433
It's the death of his parents

18
00:00:41.533 --> 00:00:43.166
Others don't know

19
00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.566
Don't you know about this?

20
00:00:47.533 --> 00:00:49.100
I can't let Xu Xi know for the time being

21
00:00:49.366 --> 00:00:50.966
Have you ever thought about it?

22
00:00:50.966 --> 00:00:53.966
Once he knew the truth about his parents

23
00:00:53.966 --> 00:00:55.900
Can you take it?

24
00:00:55.966 --> 00:00:57.400
So I've been waiting

25
00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:58.300
Wait for him to fall in love with you

26
00:00:58.933 --> 00:01:02.800
When he finds out that you had something to do with his parents' deaths

27
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.800
He will hate you

28
00:01:08.866 --> 00:01:09.666
Small 7
