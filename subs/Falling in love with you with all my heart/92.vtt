00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:01.600
god

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Is a fairy

3
00:00:04.466 --> 00:00:06.000
I put Tianlan

4
00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:09.366
Bring back Shanghai from abroad

5
00:00:09.766 --> 00:00:12.300
Took over Universal Group

6
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.433
But he always misses you

7
00:00:15.466 --> 00:00:16.633
Three years ago.

8
00:00:16.866 --> 00:00:20.000
When he knew that Xu was going bankrupt

9
00:00:20.266 --> 00:00:22.166
He cares about you.

10
00:00:22.166 --> 00:00:25.033
The first time I ran to Yuncheng

11
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:29.700
He wants to save Xu shi in the name of returning the girl

12
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:32.300
At this time, Shen Yu knew about it

13
00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:33.866
He followed.

14
00:00:33.866 --> 00:00:36.833
He's a gambler

15
00:00:36.866 --> 00:00:38.166
He made money

16
00:00:38.166 --> 00:00:41.333
He actually pretended to be in the name of Qinglan

17
00:00:41.333 --> 00:00:45.600
Getting them to embezzle workers' wages?

18
00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:47.200
So

19
00:00:47.933 --> 00:00:49.833
My parents were forced to leave

20
00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.500
So I believed in Shen Yu's plan

21
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.900
Give the tens of millions in cash to Shen Yu

22
00:00:55.933 --> 00:00:57.666
He wants the garden group to help him

23
00:00:58.566 --> 00:01:01.500
When the court learned of this

24
00:01:01.666 --> 00:01:05.766
Shen Yu has donated and fled

25
00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:08.233
Your parents too

26
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.300
Ouch, are they afraid of implicating you?

27
00:01:13.466 --> 00:01:15.200
The hole of the post-mortem inspection

28
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.100
It's all plated with sky blue.

29
00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:23.700
So

30
00:01:24.366 --> 00:01:26.066
It has been used foolishly

31
00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.366
Then it hurts to listen

32
00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.766
I was soft-hearted when I was a child

33
00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:36.466
Compared to death

34
00:01:36.466 --> 00:01:40.933
Sounds like you let this bastard go.

35
00:01:40.933 --> 00:01:46.300
It doesn't sound like he did anything to hurt you.

36
00:01:51.366 --> 00:01:53.700
Grandpa Shen, let me ask you one question

37
00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:57.433
Three years ago, you chose to stand on Shen Yu's side

38
00:01:57.966 --> 00:01:59.100
But today

39
00:01:59.733 --> 00:02:01.366
You still have to watch Shen helplessly

40
00:02:01.366 --> 00:02:03.000
Was Sky Blue framed to death?

41
00:02:03.466 --> 00:02:05.033
I'm sorry sky blue

42
00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:06.900
I'm sorry for you too.

43
00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:09.766
What do you think we should do to find Shen Yue?
