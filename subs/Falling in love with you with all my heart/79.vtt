00:00:01.966 --> 00:00:04.966
What do you mean you can't wake up?

2
00:00:05.166 --> 00:00:06.633
The patient suffered severe head trauma

3
00:00:07.133 --> 00:00:08.500
Risk of brain death

4
00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.400
Please be mentally prepared

5
00:00:13.733 --> 00:00:16.000
What about uncle?

6
00:00:17.366 --> 00:00:18.533
I'm dead too.

7
00:00:18.533 --> 00:00:19.900
I want you to pay

8
00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:22.166
I'm your dad

9
00:00:22.166 --> 00:00:22.966
Are you going to rebel?

10
00:00:22.966 --> 00:00:24.166
If you hadn't come back

11
00:00:24.166 --> 00:00:26.433
How could grandpa die?

12
00:00:26.866 --> 00:00:28.266
What does it have to do with me?

13
00:00:28.933 --> 00:00:30.566
Your Majesty, you little liar

14
00:00:30.566 --> 00:00:32.400
He pushed your grandfather down

15
00:00:34.266 --> 00:00:37.600
Nonsense, it's you who rushed in and messed around

16
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.200
Grandpa Shen won't give you money

17
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:40.833
You push him to the ground

18
00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.866
I, Shen Yu, am no longer a thing

19
00:00:43.933 --> 00:00:46.100
Would I murder my own father?

20
00:00:47.133 --> 00:00:47.933
King

21
00:00:48.866 --> 00:00:50.400
You have to believe me.

22
00:00:56.466 --> 00:00:57.866
What the hell is going on here?

23
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.300
The body is soft

24
00:01:01.966 --> 00:01:03.466
You doubt me

25
00:01:05.333 --> 00:01:07.600
Wait for him, only you know the password in the Shen family

26
00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:08.766
All the servants

27
00:01:08.766 --> 00:01:10.600
Everyone knows that you are the fiancÃ©e of Dung Lan

28
00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:11.766
So I won't stop you.

29
00:01:11.766 --> 00:01:13.233
You have a chance

30
00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.900
servant

31
00:01:19.066 --> 00:01:21.566
I remember a servant was there at the time

32
00:01:28.933 --> 00:01:31.400
You saw it when Grandpa Shen fell

33
00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.000
Tell them who defeated Grandpa Shen
