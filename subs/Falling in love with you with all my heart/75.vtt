00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.033
Yo this wasn't 3 years ago

2
00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:05.300
The daughter left behind by the Xu couple?

3
00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:08.966
You know my parents?

4
00:00:09.266 --> 00:00:11.600
Well, more than knowing

5
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:14.600
Shen Yu, he is Tinglan's fiancee

6
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:15.966
Don't provoke him

7
00:00:15.966 --> 00:00:17.066
You provoke him

8
00:00:17.066 --> 00:00:18.900
Tinglan won't let you go

9
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.166
It's right to be your enemy

10
00:00:22.333 --> 00:00:24.666
As cold-blooded as Shen Tinglan

11
00:00:26.133 --> 00:00:26.933
What do you mean?

12
00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:28.600
What do you mean by marrying your enemy?

13
00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:29.700
You make it clear

14
00:00:36.566 --> 00:00:39.366
I dare not provoke Dad that kid

15
00:00:39.666 --> 00:00:41.700
How is the group now?

16
00:00:41.933 --> 00:00:43.566
As long as you don't make trouble

17
00:00:43.566 --> 00:00:45.233
And everything was going well.

18
00:00:46.166 --> 00:00:47.466
Good luck

19
00:00:47.466 --> 00:00:48.600
Good luck

20
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:49.600
OK

21
00:00:49.866 --> 00:00:52.966
Well, I owe you money now.

22
00:00:52.966 --> 00:00:55.666
Can you give it to me from the group?

23
00:00:55.666 --> 00:00:56.566
You you

24
00:00:57.966 --> 00:01:00.266
Are you gambling outside again?

25
00:01:00.566 --> 00:01:02.366
I've already asked

26
00:01:02.366 --> 00:01:05.066
Now our group has a market value of tens of billions

27
00:01:05.133 --> 00:01:07.033
Move me tens of millions, what's the matter?

28
00:01:07.066 --> 00:01:10.366
You moved all your assets out

29
00:01:10.366 --> 00:01:13.366
That's listening to it for two months without sleep?

30
00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.233
I have to face all my opponents alone

31
00:01:16.366 --> 00:01:19.733
And those old guys on the cannibal board

32
00:01:19.733 --> 00:01:21.200
It's all settled

33
00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.600
Saved the company

34
00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.600
What face do you have to ask for money?

35
00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.366
I am his father

36
00:01:26.366 --> 00:01:27.833
This is what he should do.
