00:00:01.133 --> 00:00:02.466
It's not like that.

2
00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:03.966
Listen to me explain to you

3
00:00:06.333 --> 00:00:10.833
What do you mean my parents' death has something to do with you?

4
00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:14.166
Your parents' death is lazy

5
00:00:16.066 --> 00:00:16.800
Song Manshuo

6
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.566
You came to Yuncheng three years ago for me

7
00:00:19.566 --> 00:00:22.466
It turned out that he wanted to use Xu's Group as a stepping stone?

8
00:00:22.566 --> 00:00:25.066
No wonder you are so fast.

9
00:00:25.166 --> 00:00:27.500
Get the patent documents inside Xu's

10
00:00:27.733 --> 00:00:28.833
In your heart

11
00:00:29.966 --> 00:00:31.233
That's who I am.

12
00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:33.166
Then you tell me

13
00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.200
The death of you and my parents

14
00:00:35.666 --> 00:00:37.066
Does it matter?

15
00:00:37.166 --> 00:00:39.700
Let's go back and I'll explain it to you slowly, okay?

16
00:00:40.966 --> 00:00:41.366
Nope.

17
00:00:41.366 --> 00:00:44.800
After Shen hears about this in the future, I will check it myself

18
00:00:45.066 --> 00:00:47.966
From now on we have no more melons

19
00:00:50.733 --> 00:00:52.300
Xu Xintinglan

20
00:00:52.533 --> 00:00:57.000
Listen to Lan, you must not say it out loud.

21
00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.000
He is your father after all

22
00:01:00.866 --> 00:01:03.500
When my father and my mother were seriously ill in the hospital

23
00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.466
He took the money and squandered it at the casino

24
00:01:05.733 --> 00:01:07.400
It doesn't matter if the package is lost abroad

25
00:01:07.766 --> 00:01:09.200
Does he deserve to be a father?

26
00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.400
I didn't teach him well.

27
00:01:13.533 --> 00:01:16.266
It's my old man's fault

28
00:01:16.266 --> 00:01:17.900
He robbed Golighton three years ago

29
00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:18.900
jacketeer

30
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.900
Parents drove them to a dead end

31
00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.266
Grandpa, you begged me the same

32
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.700
But what about the message?

33
00:01:24.966 --> 00:01:27.166
What's wrong with him?
