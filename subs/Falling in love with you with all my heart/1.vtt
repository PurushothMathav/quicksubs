00:00:09.266 --> 00:00:11.866
Creek, creek, creek.

00:00:11.866 --> 00:00:13.500
Shall I treat you to dinner tonight?

3
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.500
Xiaoxi, I really like you.

4
00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.366
Give me a chance, brook, oops.

5
00:00:17.366 --> 00:00:18.966
Xiaoxi is the first consortium in Lincheng

6
00:00:18.966 --> 00:00:20.400
Miss Xu's Group

7
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:21.600
Rare your treat

8
00:00:29.533 --> 00:00:30.333
Hello

9
00:01:11.166 --> 00:01:14.033
Stinky girl, what are you disciplining?

10
00:01:14.266 --> 00:01:15.533
You still think

11
00:01:15.533 --> 00:01:19.366
Are you the First Miss Xu Family of Yuancheng First Financial Group?

12
00:01:19.366 --> 00:01:23.200
Hmph, your parents have long been bankrupt and robbed to death

13
00:01:25.166 --> 00:01:25.966
Shanshan

14
00:01:26.466 --> 00:01:29.566
Please show some respect to my parents.

15
00:01:29.566 --> 00:01:30.966
Dare to talk back

16
00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:32.166
At first

17
00:01:32.166 --> 00:01:34.300
If you didn't think your parents could leave you something

18
00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:36.200
Insurance inheritance or something

19
00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.400
Who's brain is broken to take in your oil bottle?

20
00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.766
I'm going to work, move me out quickly

21
00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:44.466
Finally got hit by a car when he went out

22
00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:51.866
How many times are you late?

23
00:01:51.866 --> 00:01:52.966
Don't want to roll

24
00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:54.466
Sorry, sorry.

25
00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.900
Xu Xi

26
00:02:14.666 --> 00:02:17.966
Yo, isn't this our Miss Xu?

27
00:02:17.966 --> 00:02:21.466
God, Xiaoxi, why are you dressed like this?

28
00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:22.966
Are you selling it?

29
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.400
Hey, Xiaoli, didn't you like him very much before?

30
00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:29.600
Make an offer

31
00:02:30.333 --> 00:02:31.366
Excuse me.

32
00:02:31.533 --> 00:02:33.400
You guys play first?

33
00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.333
What do you think you are still the same as before?

34
00:02:37.333 --> 00:02:39.166
A high-ranking lady?

35
00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:42.700
Didn't you look down on me before?

36
00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.500
Ah, I'll accompany you today, I'll treat you to a drink

37
00:02:45.566 --> 00:02:49.400
You can't finish drinking today, don't you want to leave?

38
00:02:51.533 --> 00:02:52.333
Ah!

39
00:02:55.766 --> 00:02:56.800
Drink fast

40
00:02:57.966 --> 00:02:59.166
Drink it all for me

41
00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.400
Dare to hit me and I will kill you
