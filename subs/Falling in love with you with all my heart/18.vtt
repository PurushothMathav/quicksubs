00:00:00.466 --> 00:00:01.966
How dare you not listen to Mr. Shen's words?

2
00:00:01.966 --> 00:00:02.933
Go away

3
00:00:02.933 --> 00:00:05.700
Are you the one who should get out?

4
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.633
Mr. Shen, are you mistaken?

5
00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:09.866
Take your place

6
00:00:10.333 --> 00:00:11.266
Move into the office

7
00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.866
I, Mr. Shen, he is just a little assistant

8
00:00:14.966 --> 00:00:17.000
I'm afraid this is inappropriate

9
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:18.966
Go to the personnel department to leave now

10
00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:20.700
I don't need employees who teach me how to do things

11
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:21.500
And

12
00:00:22.333 --> 00:00:24.633
If you are free

13
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.466
Pack up with him and get out

14
00:00:26.966 --> 00:00:30.633
Why did you fire Mr. Shen?

15
00:00:31.066 --> 00:00:32.400
Don't you dare listen?

16
00:00:32.466 --> 00:00:33.266
learn

17
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:35.033
Ah to

18
00:00:46.666 --> 00:00:48.500
So eloquent in front of me

19
00:00:48.866 --> 00:00:50.633
How can I be cowardly in front of others?

20
00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.766
Why did you help me just now?

21
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:55.566
You are my assistant

22
00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.833
Embarrassing you is hitting me in the face

23
00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.966
Ok but thank you anyway

24
00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:06.666
You are mine

25
00:01:07.666 --> 00:01:08.766
No one was moved

26
00:01:15.133 --> 00:01:17.866
Just wait, sooner or later

27
00:01:18.066 --> 00:01:19.566
I will make you trust me.

28
00:01:20.366 --> 00:01:22.400
In willingly

29
00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.800
Help me find out the truth

30
00:01:28.066 --> 00:01:28.866
Mr. Shen

31
00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:32.666
Uh sorry me

32
00:01:36.133 --> 00:01:39.033
Is this also part of your plan? Study
