00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:04.400
Mr. Shen is really clearly priced

2
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.866
It seems that my night has not been in vain

3
00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:08.100
Thank you Mr. Shen

4
00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:19.233
This is the Xu Group back then

5
00:00:19.766 --> 00:00:22.500
All patented technologies and core information

6
00:00:22.966 --> 00:00:24.700
Isn't it already auctioned?

7
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.100
How could it cost some effort?

8
00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:28.900
But it doesn't matter.

9
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:30.500
Shen Tinglan

10
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.500
You know you gave me these documents

11
00:00:34.066 --> 00:00:36.366
Does it mean anything? It means

12
00:00:37.566 --> 00:00:39.533
In fact, you can make a comeback at any time

13
00:00:39.533 --> 00:00:40.900
Then you give me these.

14
00:00:41.266 --> 00:00:42.766
There are conditions, right?

15
00:00:42.933 --> 00:00:45.033
I hope you don't cling to what happened back then anymore

16
00:00:45.333 --> 00:00:48.800
You don't want me to investigate what happened back then why

17
00:00:52.366 --> 00:00:53.800
You get this document

18
00:00:54.066 --> 00:00:56.066
Instead of taking the risk to investigate what happened back then

19
00:00:56.133 --> 00:00:57.433
Why don't you let Xu's restart?

20
00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:59.433
Is it not good?

21
00:01:05.066 --> 00:01:05.866
No.

22
00:01:06.533 --> 00:01:09.866
It will take at least half a year to prepare these.

23
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.200
But you didn't know me at the time

24
00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.233
Shen Tingleng, what the hell is going on?

25
00:01:15.366 --> 00:01:16.466
bumped into it by chance

26
00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:18.500
on a whim

27
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:19.766
Just take a picture

28
00:01:20.166 --> 00:01:21.666
I wanted to use it for Huanyu

29
00:01:21.933 --> 00:01:24.566
But can you be a judge now?

30
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.200
So

31
00:01:26.733 --> 00:01:28.833
You should have known Xu Shi before

32
00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.433
That year

33
00:01:30.966 --> 00:01:32.233
How much do you know?
