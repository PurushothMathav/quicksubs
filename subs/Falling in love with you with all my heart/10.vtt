00:00:00.966 --> 00:00:02.700
Soman, what are you doing?

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.133
Sorry.

3
00:00:04.133 --> 00:00:05.566
My hand slipped.

4
00:00:05.566 --> 00:00:06.833
Are you all right?

5
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:10.366
Yueyao, did you bring any clothes?

6
00:00:10.866 --> 00:00:14.033
Ah, be careful, change clothes with me and go

7
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.966
Song Man, I warn you

8
00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:24.433
On the Shen family's premises

9
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.066
Better put away your little tricks

10
00:00:27.733 --> 00:00:30.200
Otherwise I don't mind telling your father

11
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:32.766
I'm sorry, Sirius.

12
00:00:32.766 --> 00:00:35.466
The violin performer I ordered is alone on the road

13
00:00:35.533 --> 00:00:36.900
It may be 30 minutes late.

14
00:00:37.733 --> 00:00:39.466
The dinner is only 20 minutes away

15
00:00:39.533 --> 00:00:42.066
I'll give you 15 minutes to deal with this.

16
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:43.200
Can't handle it well

17
00:00:43.666 --> 00:00:46.300
You don't have to come tomorrow, Mr. Shen

18
00:01:19.666 --> 00:01:22.233
Well, how is uncle?

19
00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:24.000
Our little seven gets dressed up

20
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.600
Not worse than your star

21
00:01:30.133 --> 00:01:33.100
I remember Xiaoxi used to be from a foreign music academy

22
00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.900
It just so happens that the original player can't come

23
00:01:35.966 --> 00:01:37.766
Why don't you go save a scene?

24
00:01:39.866 --> 00:01:41.066
That's not appropriate.

25
00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.900
Ah, I almost forgot.

26
00:01:43.966 --> 00:01:45.900
Xiaoxijia went bankrupt

27
00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:47.400
Can't afford tuition

28
00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.033
Has dropped out

29
00:01:49.666 --> 00:01:51.466
On your current terms

30
00:01:52.566 --> 00:01:54.666
I haven't played the piano in years

31
00:01:55.466 --> 00:01:57.066
Postpone it ok

32
00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:59.566
Here I come.

33
00:02:02.333 --> 00:02:04.566
Guiyang, did you bring any clothes?

34
00:02:04.866 --> 00:02:08.600
Ah, be careful, I'll take you to change your clothes

35
00:02:33.866 --> 00:02:36.266
Violins are not something that poor people can play with

36
00:02:36.266 --> 00:02:38.500
If you don't touch it for half a month, it will regress.

37
00:02:38.666 --> 00:02:41.800
Just wait and see Miss Xu lose face

38
00:02:43.666 --> 00:02:46.600
The clothes have been changed, but
