00:00:01.866 --> 00:00:03.433
You can tell him

2
00:00:03.466 --> 00:00:07.066
He knows exactly what kind of person I am

3
00:00:08.566 --> 00:00:09.366
Hey

4
00:00:10.866 --> 00:00:13.766
Your celebrity wolf doesn't care about anything

5
00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:16.566
Aren't you afraid of walking away?

6
00:00:16.566 --> 00:00:18.466
What do you want to do hehe

7
00:00:19.366 --> 00:00:20.866
I guessed it right

8
00:00:20.866 --> 00:00:23.400
You don't have money, I can ask him for it.

9
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.633
What do you dare me to do?

10
00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:27.366
I'm all alone.

11
00:00:27.366 --> 00:00:29.000
The big deal is to die together

12
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:30.900
Hahaha

13
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.500
I didn't expect you to climb high branches, you stinky bitch

14
00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.933
Ok ok hahaha

15
00:00:37.933 --> 00:00:39.900
I just wanted to see if he was rich

16
00:00:39.933 --> 00:00:41.300
If you go to get revenge on him

17
00:00:41.533 --> 00:00:44.000
Then I'll just change the man at most

18
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.600
Then since you don't care

19
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.833
Why don't you let me find him?

20
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.033
I haven't reaped any benefits from him yet

21
00:00:51.333 --> 00:00:52.966
Of course I don't want anything to happen to him.

22
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.133
After all, the chairperson of Huanyu Group

23
00:00:55.133 --> 00:00:57.000
Not everyone can hope for it

24
00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.866
But that day in your company building

25
00:00:59.866 --> 00:01:03.166
I see he is very nice to you

26
00:01:03.166 --> 00:01:04.633
I deliberately pretended to be pitiful

27
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.466
It's just a means to make him die for me

28
00:01:07.466 --> 00:01:08.866
I didn't expect him to be so stupid

29
00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.166
Really stupid
