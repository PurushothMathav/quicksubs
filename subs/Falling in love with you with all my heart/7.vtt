00:00:00.466 --> 00:00:02.200
How dare you fight Manman

2
00:00:02.366 --> 00:00:04.666
Do you know who I am now?

3
00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:06.900
Don't see what you are

4
00:00:08.266 --> 00:00:10.633
Who is he and what does it have to do with me?

5
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.266
He is also a big shot like Shen Tinglan

6
00:00:14.366 --> 00:00:16.700
How could it have anything to do with a scumbag like you?

7
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:19.833
Shen Tianlan Xu Xi

8
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.766
I know you're jealous of me

9
00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.433
But you got my shoes dirty.

10
00:00:24.966 --> 00:00:26.833
You have to wipe it clean

11
00:00:27.333 --> 00:00:28.633
After all.

12
00:00:28.966 --> 00:00:30.800
You can't afford it now

13
00:00:34.333 --> 00:00:35.700
I really can't afford it.

14
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.966
After all, there is only one pair of limited editions in the world.

15
00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.066
Or a foreign designer?

16
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.966
I came back in person and gave it to the buyer.

17
00:00:42.966 --> 00:00:44.233
How do you know?

18
00:00:47.133 --> 00:00:49.666
Because the owner of these shoes is me.

19
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.033
It's just that in order to pay off the debt

20
00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:54.366
I've put him on a secondhand website.

21
00:00:57.066 --> 00:01:00.000
I didn't expect to be abducted by you.

22
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.666
I didn't expect the big star Song Man

23
00:01:01.666 --> 00:01:03.133
I'm actually wearing second-hand shoes

24
00:01:03.133 --> 00:01:06.200
This is too embarrassing, haha.

25
00:01:09.933 --> 00:01:12.700
Xu Xi, back then, you had Xu's Group as a lawyer

26
00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.766
But now they're all dead.

27
00:01:14.766 --> 00:01:16.466
You're not even a waiter

28
00:01:16.766 --> 00:01:17.900
What can you compare to me?

29
00:01:25.133 --> 00:01:26.666
From before to now

30
00:01:26.666 --> 00:01:28.766
I, Xu Xi, never wanted to argue with you

31
00:01:29.133 --> 00:01:33.166
Because you don't deserve you

32
00:01:45.533 --> 00:01:46.833
Who gave you the courage?

33
00:01:47.966 --> 00:01:49.366
Touch my people
