00:00:00.866 --> 00:00:02.600
Shen Ting came to harm my parents

2
00:00:03.366 --> 00:00:04.900
I had to.

3
00:00:04.966 --> 00:00:06.700
It's all my fault

4
00:00:07.466 --> 00:00:10.066
Blame me for being stubborn

5
00:00:10.066 --> 00:00:13.633
Oops, laissez-faire

6
00:00:14.266 --> 00:00:17.966
Hurt people to listen to cold and you

7
00:00:19.466 --> 00:00:21.000
What do you mean by that?

8
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.633
Sounds like I have you in my heart

9
00:00:23.766 --> 00:00:26.666
More important than my grandfather

10
00:00:26.666 --> 00:00:30.300
Are you saying he can harm your family?

11
00:00:32.133 --> 00:00:36.033
Impossible after Xu went bankrupt three years ago

12
00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.666
He came to Yuncheng

13
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:39.800
Is this all a coincidence?

14
00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.166
He went to Yunchang for one purpose

15
00:00:43.333 --> 00:00:46.433
Just to protect you?

16
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.166
Then why did the Xu Group still go bankrupt?

17
00:00:53.766 --> 00:00:55.500
Xu went bankrupt

18
00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:58.400
It has nothing to do with others

19
00:00:59.733 --> 00:01:04.866
No, I don't believe your father was a business wizard

20
00:01:04.866 --> 00:01:08.233
But he has very little experience.

21
00:01:08.466 --> 00:01:10.600
The bachelor's foundation is not returned

22
00:01:10.966 --> 00:01:13.166
He ran out of work.

23
00:01:13.166 --> 00:01:15.700
I couldn't take it anymore

24
00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.900
No wonder others

25
00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:19.366
I know my parents

26
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:20.566
Even bankruptcy

27
00:01:20.766 --> 00:01:23.166
They wouldn't want to commit suicide.

28
00:01:23.766 --> 00:01:26.033
This is me

29
00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.000
Ahhhh!

30
00:01:29.933 --> 00:01:31.600
Ahhh

31
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.800
Evil

32
00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:37.200
Ah!

33
00:01:37.866 --> 00:01:38.666
Ah!

34
00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.966
What did you do to make your parents jump off the building to commit suicide?

35
00:01:43.966 --> 00:01:46.400
YES YES YES

36
00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.066
God Jade

37
00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:50.900
Is he the beast?

38
00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:53.400
Pardon me?
