00:00:01.766 --> 00:00:02.866
Miss Xu

2
00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:05.433
You want to clear the streets with me so soon?

3
00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:09.066
Didn't Mr. Shen warn me that I couldn't tell you otherwise?

4
00:00:09.266 --> 00:00:11.800
Mr. Shen's means are high, I dare not test you

5
00:00:12.133 --> 00:00:15.566
Don't worry, you still have a little value to me for the time being.

6
00:00:15.933 --> 00:00:16.900
Outside.

7
00:00:17.466 --> 00:00:19.000
I'll give you enough face

8
00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:21.300
It seems that Mr. Shen

9
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.066
This is to remind me to live up to my value

10
00:00:24.366 --> 00:00:25.166
Go ahead.

11
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.666
I still understand the principle of equivalent exchange

12
00:00:28.333 --> 00:00:30.366
Song Man has gone to my old man's side

13
00:00:30.366 --> 00:00:31.766
I need an excuse

14
00:00:32.166 --> 00:00:33.700
To block me and his foundation

15
00:00:33.966 --> 00:00:35.566
How do you want me to cooperate?

16
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:43.533
Get a certificate from me

17
00:00:43.533 --> 00:00:46.366
That's... That's part of the deal

18
00:00:46.366 --> 00:00:48.466
I've never been able to do things backwards

19
00:00:48.966 --> 00:00:50.666
They are all fiancÃ©es

20
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.666
How about doing something?

21
00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:57.833
dare

22
00:00:58.666 --> 00:01:00.966
Mr. Shen is not afraid of what I am afraid of

23
00:01:13.933 --> 00:01:15.766
I went to my aunt's house to get the account book

24
00:01:16.066 --> 00:01:17.366
Your aunt he

25
00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.866
Last time I was kicked out by him on purpose.

26
00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.633
The documents and things were deliberately withheld by him

27
00:01:23.366 --> 00:01:24.466
I'll go with you.

28
00:01:24.566 --> 00:01:26.566
You can't come back alone, no need
