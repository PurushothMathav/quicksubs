00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:08.360
Is it convenient to chat with Liangjun?

2
00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:11.790
Then I have something to say.

3
00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.450
What about Reading? I can take care of it for you.

4
00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:16.370
But I donâ€™t want to get involved in the matter between you and Li Anna.

5
00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:19.090
Therefore, marriage is a matter of time, without counting.

6
00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.530
No, please try. You have spent so much effort to get these five free meals.

7
00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:25.930
The fight is full.

8
00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:28.920
Except for Five, no one can help you escape into paid care.

9
00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:33.010
You, run,

10
00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:35.800
Mr. Yan took me from beginning to end,

11
00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.140
Everything has changed.

12
00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.360
I understand your bottom line, why would I want to give you a message first?

13
00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:45.260
The money is amazing.

14
00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.890
From now on, Mr. Yan will keep his distance from me.

15
00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:49.990
Don't be willing to thank me

16
00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:56.060
What did I say?

17
00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:58.180
We are all under joint supervision

18
00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:59.220
Let's ask him

19
00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:06.310
This person is unhappy

20
00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:08.900
Don't look at us

21
00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:12.290
Just go with your girlfriend, right?

22
00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:13.760
The process of looking less at people

23
00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:18.730
Then why are you my girlfriend and my mother?

24
00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:20.230
Don't let me and the fool

25
00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.250
The first night of the year

26
00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.730
How about being third in age in general?

27
00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:33.830
Now that I have left my girlfriend, I am the third one.

28
00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.490
Do you want to keep your words?

29
00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.140
Are you promising me?
