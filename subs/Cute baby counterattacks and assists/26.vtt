00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.000
The total single of singing such as comes out as,

2
00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:12.720
I'm here to put you in. You want to ask,

3
00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:14.100
What is the first company to study?

4
00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:15.330
Although I still care

5
00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.090
Widow Moon on two goals

6
00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:19.350
Memory is about what they do

7
00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:21.370
These two years are the cortical layer

8
00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:23.630
As the two major guesses behind the jump

9
00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:25.650
I've never figured out a question

10
00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:28.320
There are still questions you can’t figure out. Pay taxes early.

11
00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.640
You are just a fourteen-year-old child

12
00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:31.880
a child of fourteen

13
00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:33.360
Stay up until midnight

14
00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.260
Let’s take a look at a restaurant where more than a million orders have been made.

15
00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.850
Why don't you go back to your room and rest?

16
00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:54.750
what did you call me

17
00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:57.790
I just asked you if it was milk

18
00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:00.330
Otherwise, I'll drink it from your car.

19
00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:01.510
Go back to your room and rest

20
00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:11.660
Just really cheap

21
00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.090
I'll help you early tomorrow

22
00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.830
I'll tie you on the plane too

23
00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:22.360
Don't hurt me

24
00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:23.620
My eyes are clear

25
00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:25.200
I can’t call a son like you

26
00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:27.990
Our eyes are just thinking about problems in books

27
00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.570
You hand me over to your set

28
00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:31.830
Don’t you even have enough paper?

29
00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:33.910
Shi Yu and I exclaimed in love and in spirit

30
00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:37.900
Why do you want me to be so angry that I beg you?

31
00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:40.390
Live in the Planning and Television Institute

32
00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:41.390
I only thought of you

33
00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:42.920
take that girl

34
00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:47.020
So that there will be something bad involved in the future, Nantian, please remember

35
00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.430
Those two cars were meant to carry you.

36
00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:51.220
it's that girl

37
00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:52.320
You can lie down

38
00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:54.220
You still have the advantage to meet her eyes
