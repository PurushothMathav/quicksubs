00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.966
You mean Nu Skin enters the neutral group?

2
00:00:02.966 --> 00:00:04.266
You arranged it.

3
00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:07.433
Shen Rong, you dog

4
00:00:07.966 --> 00:00:09.900
Humiliate me over and over again

5
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.300
I won't let you do anything you want

6
00:00:12.366 --> 00:00:14.000
Remembering memories as new

7
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.333
Next life

8
00:00:15.333 --> 00:00:18.066
Of course, my father is an executive at the Neutral Group

9
00:00:18.133 --> 00:00:19.200
Happens to be in charge of personnel

10
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.600
See the introduction of Nu Skin

11
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.033
Of course take good care of it

12
00:00:22.566 --> 00:00:24.266
Thank you Xu Shao for helping to speak

13
00:00:24.266 --> 00:00:24.700
Otherwise

14
00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:27.100
I might not be able to work in a neutral group

15
00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:29.500
Well, it's not like some kind of crap.

16
00:00:29.666 --> 00:00:32.566
Since you can still shamelessly claim credit

17
00:00:32.566 --> 00:00:35.666
As sovereign as the Neutral Group

18
00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:36.933
Will not pay attention

19
00:00:36.933 --> 00:00:39.333
A waste with no identity

20
00:00:39.333 --> 00:00:40.666
Talk nonsense here

21
00:00:40.666 --> 00:00:43.266
If it is not guaranteed, it will also anger the Chongli Group

22
00:00:43.266 --> 00:00:44.200
Do you hear me?

23
00:00:44.266 --> 00:00:45.966
You mud thing that can't hold up the wall

24
00:00:45.966 --> 00:00:48.200
Learn more from such excellent people in the future

25
00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.266
Get rid of all your lying habits

26
00:00:50.266 --> 00:00:52.100
If you were half as good as Xu Ming

27
00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.933
I can also consider letting you marry Rujin

28
00:00:53.933 --> 00:00:55.800
But don't even think about it now

29
00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.300
Hey, Uncle Ji, don't be angry.

30
00:00:58.300 --> 00:00:59.333
Is there someone here?

31
00:00:59.333 --> 00:01:01.400
I was born cheap

32
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.566
This is something that will never change in a lifetime

33
00:01:03.566 --> 00:01:04.700
Are you sure?

34
00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:07.300
It was you who asked Ruxin to work for Neutral Group

35
00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.000
It's not him, is it you?

36
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Of course it's me.

37
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
I happen to be going to the Neutral Group tomorrow.

38
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.033
Then you will naturally know the truth and falsehood
