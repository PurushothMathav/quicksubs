00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:04.500
Grandpa

2
00:00:05.733 --> 00:00:08.733
Welcome, Mr. Shen. How troublesome is this time?

3
00:00:08.733 --> 00:00:09.500
No need to be polite

4
00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:11.700
This auction also happens to have what I need

5
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.166
I didn't expect an auction to be so lively

6
00:00:14.166 --> 00:00:15.933
Mr. Shen, we meet again

7
00:00:15.933 --> 00:00:16.666
At auction

8
00:00:16.666 --> 00:00:19.066
If Mr. Shen needs anything, please tell me.

9
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.400
The old man bought it all for you

10
00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:22.666
Hey that trash

11
00:00:22.666 --> 00:00:23.666
How can it be the most

12
00:00:23.666 --> 00:00:25.300
The relationship between the top price and the official price

13
00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.300
Is the identity behind it really not simple?

14
00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:30.366
It's not living off a woman's lungs

15
00:00:30.366 --> 00:00:31.900
Wait until he gets tired of being played by women

16
00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:34.766
In the end, it didn't end up with a down-and-out stinky dog

17
00:00:34.766 --> 00:00:35.566
Hey

18
00:00:36.133 --> 00:00:39.233
Could it be that this old fox also knew about Dao Jun?

19
00:00:39.266 --> 00:00:40.866
real identity

20
00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.600
Hey, what does Mr. Shen want?

21
00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.900
My Qin family will naturally take action

22
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:47.800
Gunma doesn't need help

23
00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.366
Okay, the auction is about to start

24
00:00:50.366 --> 00:00:52.133
Go back to your place

25
00:00:52.133 --> 00:00:53.766
Mr. Shen, please

26
00:01:00.666 --> 00:01:01.366
Mr. Shen?

27
00:01:01.366 --> 00:01:04.000
If you need anything, feel free to ask.

28
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.600
