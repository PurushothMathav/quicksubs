00:00:00.866 --> 00:00:02.533
What an ordinary man!

2
00:00:02.533 --> 00:00:03.700
Not worthy of me

3
00:00:03.866 --> 00:00:06.966
Hahaha, how does this child speak?

4
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.166
Xiao Rong uh

5
00:00:08.166 --> 00:00:10.200
Ruxin, this child's mouth is open-mouthed

6
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.466
Don't take it personally.

7
00:00:11.466 --> 00:00:12.466
Haven't eaten?

8
00:00:12.466 --> 00:00:13.966
Just in time for us to be together

9
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:14.866
Ruxin

10
00:00:14.866 --> 00:00:17.100
I just happened to help your brother Xiaorong get a pair of dishes and chopsticks.

11
00:00:17.366 --> 00:00:19.000
I have something to do, I'm going out

12
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.000
So late

13
00:00:20.266 --> 00:00:22.133
Mom, it's my classmate's birthday today.

14
00:00:22.133 --> 00:00:23.700
Can you wait in a hurry?

15
00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:25.133
So late

16
00:00:25.133 --> 00:00:26.966
How can you be a girl?

17
00:00:26.966 --> 00:00:29.400
It's just right to let Xiaorong go with you

18
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.966
Introduce him to your friends

19
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.933
God

20
00:00:35.933 --> 00:00:38.366
My friends are either rich or expensive

21
00:00:38.533 --> 00:00:40.666
Can't play with him

22
00:00:40.666 --> 00:00:44.066
If you don't agree, don't go to mom

23
00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.800
OK

24
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.966
Just take him with you, at least you have someone to take care of you?

25
00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.200
how

26
00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:57.833
Go, go, have fun!

27
00:00:59.566 --> 00:01:01.300
Hey! Can I tell you?

28
00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:02.533
Don't think my mom is turning to you

29
00:01:02.533 --> 00:01:04.100
What do you think of me?

30
00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.266
We are two people from different worlds

31
00:01:06.266 --> 00:01:07.866
It's impossible to be together

32
00:01:07.866 --> 00:01:09.533
I will become one in the future

33
00:01:09.533 --> 00:01:12.700
A strong woman like Qin Mengying knows

34
00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.666
I'll take a call, then I'll go in first

35
00:01:18.333 --> 00:01:19.133
Wait a minute, don't run around

36
00:01:19.133 --> 00:01:20.200
Don't blame me

37
00:01:23.266 --> 00:01:24.666
Hello Mr. Shen

38
00:01:24.666 --> 00:01:26.000
Something happened to my grandpa.

39
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.766
Please save him
