00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:01.866
Shen Guangrong is fucking you

2
00:00:02.166 --> 00:00:03.866
This time I want you to die here

3
00:00:03.866 --> 00:00:04.800
Not going yet

4
00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.366
Doesn't it look like a chartered car?

5
00:00:07.966 --> 00:00:10.166
Mr. Zhuo, why are you here?

6
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.600
Did you betray Zhongxia Liang Qin Zemo's wife?

7
00:00:13.766 --> 00:00:15.266
The wise man is in charge

8
00:00:15.266 --> 00:00:16.666
And that was my realization.

9
00:00:16.666 --> 00:00:18.900
Knowing that he is defeated, he will come to die

10
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.300
This is the stupidest thing to do.

11
00:00:21.333 --> 00:00:22.833
The biggest reason is

12
00:00:23.133 --> 00:00:25.500
I'm going to take the fame I lost before

13
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.266
Get it all back from you

14
00:00:27.266 --> 00:00:28.300
You are a warrior

15
00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.500
Candidates for future successor warriors

16
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.700
Just because you can't defeat Mr. Shen

17
00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:36.333
So I will betray Zhu Xia and destroy Mr. Shen

18
00:00:36.333 --> 00:00:38.500
You have no idea what you're about to face

19
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.866
What is it that makes you dare to speak out?

20
00:00:42.866 --> 00:00:46.233
Forget it, it's pointless to tell you so much

21
00:00:46.533 --> 00:00:47.900
Wait for these ups and downs

22
00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.800
How can you understand that the mountain lord is majestic

23
00:00:51.333 --> 00:00:52.966
Now you understand that our car is big

24
00:00:52.966 --> 00:00:54.000
Come and surrender soon

25
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.900
At the feet of our noble bloodline

26
00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:57.166
I submit to you

27
00:00:57.966 --> 00:01:00.866
Love has you, you betrayed the glory of the Temple of War

28
00:01:00.866 --> 00:01:02.700
You don't deserve to be a middle-class person

29
00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:04.966
You don't deserve to be a subordinate in your life

30
00:01:04.966 --> 00:01:07.133
Come on, you're just jealous of me

31
00:01:07.133 --> 00:01:09.933
I always seize the most powerful opportunity for myself

32
00:01:09.933 --> 00:01:11.666
And strong backers

33
00:01:11.666 --> 00:01:13.533
Give you a choice

34
00:01:13.533 --> 00:01:17.166
You will make the same choice as me

35
00:01:17.166 --> 00:01:18.000
Yes.

36
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.400
This is the charm of the noble blood of the West

37
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.666
Fate is better than you

38
00:01:23.366 --> 00:01:25.000
This is your seal

39
00:01:25.766 --> 00:01:27.400
It's ridiculous
