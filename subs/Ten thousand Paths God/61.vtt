1
00:00:01.566 --> 00:00:03.866
It's just feng shui

2
00:00:03.933 --> 00:00:04.866
Find a master

3
00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.566
What else do you know?

4
00:00:17.866 --> 00:00:18.733
Mr. Shen

5
00:00:18.733 --> 00:00:21.900
This is Guan Jucai's son Guan Ligui

6
00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:24.033
Currently the president of the Black Gold Group

7
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.700
People are very polite

8
00:00:26.933 --> 00:00:27.800
Mr. Di

9
00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:30.500
Why did you suddenly come to visit my official's house today?

10
00:00:30.733 --> 00:00:31.966
Are you here to see my dad?

11
00:00:31.966 --> 00:00:33.766
Ah close

12
00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:34.400
I heard

13
00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.933
Mr. Guan has not been in good health recently

14
00:00:36.933 --> 00:00:39.200
I specially asked the genius doctor to take a look for him

15
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:40.700
This is the genius doctor you mentioned

16
00:00:41.766 --> 00:00:43.500
I'm not in the mood to joke with you right now.

17
00:00:43.533 --> 00:00:43.966
Guan Shao

18
00:00:43.966 --> 00:00:45.866
How dare I joke with you about this?

19
00:00:45.866 --> 00:00:48.466
Mr. Shen cured Mr. Qin's illness

20
00:00:48.466 --> 00:00:50.066
And my feng shui problems

21
00:00:50.066 --> 00:00:51.333
He solved it all.

22
00:00:51.333 --> 00:00:53.066
If it wasn't for Mr. Shen

23
00:00:53.066 --> 00:00:54.866
I'm afraid you won't see me now

24
00:00:54.933 --> 00:00:56.800
The disease of hard work is cured by you

25
00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.700
That's right, your dad, it's not a disease

26
00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.166
It was the feng shui problem that was killed by someone

27
00:01:01.166 --> 00:01:02.900
If not treated earlier

28
00:01:02.966 --> 00:01:03.866
Do not seek medical attention

29
00:01:03.866 --> 00:01:04.733
Nonsense

30
00:01:04.733 --> 00:01:07.466
My dad is just weak and coughs a lot

31
00:01:07.466 --> 00:01:09.233
How could there be any danger to life?

32
00:01:09.966 --> 00:01:11.700
Are you cursing me?

33
00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.000
You have hired a lot of amazing doctors, right?

34
00:01:14.066 --> 00:01:15.300
Does it work?

35
00:01:15.966 --> 00:01:17.566
According to the agreement

36
00:01:17.666 --> 00:01:19.033
Less than three days

37
00:01:19.366 --> 00:01:22.200
Enough to kill your Guan family?

38
00:01:22.366 --> 00:01:24.233
If you dare to lie to me

39
00:01:24.266 --> 00:01:26.000
I'll let you know how good I am

40
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.300
Hey, don't dare, don't dare, don't dare
