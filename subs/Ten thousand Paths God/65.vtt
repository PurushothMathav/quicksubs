00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:01.700
Your condition has improved.

2
00:00:03.533 --> 00:00:06.433
Indeed, I feel like I can breathe well

3
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:10.800
I feel like I can stand up too

4
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.466
Dad, your illness is really cured.

5
00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:18.166
The soreness and coldness all over my body are much better

6
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.933
Little friend, get rid of this evil spirit

7
00:00:20.933 --> 00:00:22.900
Is my disease cured?

8
00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.066
Take a few more days and a few weeks off naturally

9
00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.066
This can be used as decoration.

10
00:00:28.066 --> 00:00:29.700
It's this little thing

11
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:31.266
Almost killed the old man

12
00:00:31.266 --> 00:00:33.266
Who wants this stuff?

13
00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.166
Then you can dispose of this thing for me.

14
00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.300
Mr. Guo congratulates on his recovery

15
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.700
I don't know if Du Yuanhua can be used as compensation now

16
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:49.966
For Mr. Shen

17
00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:51.500
Of course.

18
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:55.100
Du Yuanhua's wife kept it to save her life

19
00:00:55.533 --> 00:00:57.066
Now the problem is solved.

20
00:00:57.066 --> 00:00:59.566
It's useless to keep Du Yuanhua

21
00:00:59.566 --> 00:01:02.233
But it is placed in the group

22
00:01:02.366 --> 00:01:06.233
I'll take it out myself tomorrow and give it to Mr.

23
00:01:06.333 --> 00:01:09.166
Thank you, so I'll say goodbye first

24
00:01:09.166 --> 00:01:12.200
Wait a minute, some small ones have extraordinary strength.

25
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.166
Just offended

26
00:01:14.166 --> 00:01:15.733
Please also have Haihan

27
00:01:15.733 --> 00:01:18.600
If you need anything in the future

28
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:19.866
Just tell me.

29
00:01:19.866 --> 00:01:21.033
You're welcome.

30
00:01:28.333 --> 00:01:30.266
You're welcome. Goodbye.

31
00:01:31.533 --> 00:01:33.166
Farewell to Mr. Guo

32
00:01:35.666 --> 00:01:38.266
Dad, why were you so polite to him just now?

33
00:01:38.266 --> 00:01:39.433
This person

34
00:01:39.466 --> 00:01:40.566
Not easy

35
00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.000
He solved the disease that could not be diagnosed in a few minutes

36
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.200
And his hanging technique is even more superb

37
00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.300
If we offend this person

38
00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:54.400
How will the officials and neutral groups die in the future?

39
00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:55.966
We won't know
