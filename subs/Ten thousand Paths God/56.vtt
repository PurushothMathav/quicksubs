00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:02.800
Brother, that green mountain is not afraid of being burned by firewood

2
00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:04.500
You have to destroy it to have a chance

3
00:00:04.533 --> 00:00:05.600
Go away

4
00:00:05.666 --> 00:00:07.566
How can I have such a dirty brother as you?

5
00:00:07.966 --> 00:00:10.766
Even if I die standing, I will never kneel

6
00:00:10.766 --> 00:00:12.700
Don't be so damn arrogant

7
00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:14.300
Lao Tzu counts the enemy's life today

8
00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:15.866
I'm going to break your tooth too

9
00:00:15.866 --> 00:00:16.933
I'm so scared

10
00:00:16.933 --> 00:00:19.700
I'm just afraid that your teeth will break if they are not good.

11
00:00:19.733 --> 00:00:21.166
Stand up if you have the ability

12
00:00:21.166 --> 00:00:23.000
I will let the whole world know

13
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.333
It's just so

14
00:00:24.333 --> 00:00:25.133
Ah!

15
00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:27.966
Ha, I can do it.

16
00:00:27.966 --> 00:00:30.133
You can't win at all, you trash

17
00:00:30.133 --> 00:00:31.500
Go up and leave the shame behind

18
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.100
That's right, what dog thing did you say?

19
00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.866
overreach

20
00:00:34.866 --> 00:00:36.800
Even serious people lost, you say you are a fart

21
00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:37.466
What to pack

22
00:00:37.466 --> 00:00:39.333
Get the hell out of here and go home

23
00:00:39.333 --> 00:00:42.066
Shut up, Mr. Deng can't stop a move

24
00:00:42.066 --> 00:00:44.533
Why don't you just go up and be scared to pee?

25
00:00:44.533 --> 00:00:45.900
Don't embarrass you.

26
00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.066
Boy, don't you know this

27
00:00:48.066 --> 00:00:49.500
What is the meaning of contempt?

28
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:50.700
If you give up now

29
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.733
Retain at least half of the control

30
00:00:52.733 --> 00:00:53.566
If you really lose

31
00:00:53.566 --> 00:00:54.400
Could it be that

32
00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:57.366
You originally wanted to take the underground management rights of the lower middle class

33
00:00:57.366 --> 00:01:00.200
Give it all to those Western devils

34
00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:01.766
Can you afford the responsibility?

35
00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:04.000
You've combed your middle and bottom face

36
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.866
I'll wipe your butt for you, you still have the face to talk about me
