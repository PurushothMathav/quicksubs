00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:04.840
Ayuan, can I ask you a question?

2
00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:11.260
Have you ever liked Su Jiuling?

3
00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:18.850
I don't know how I should answer your question.

4
00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:24.670
In fact, I was very sure that you were Qing from the beginning.

5
00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:34.180
After Ke Zhongzhong changed the tense, he became uncertain and tried hard to distinguish the tense.

6
00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:37.070
Are you Su Jiuling or Qinghuai?

7
00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:42.710
The more I look at it, now in my memory,

8
00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:51.290
I got deeper and deeper. I know,

9
00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.250
Whether you are Su Jiuling or whatever you feel like.

10
00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:00.600
No matter how you appear in front of me,

11
00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.920
Will feel reassured again and again.

12
00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:41.760
Me too. What are your plans next?

13
00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:48.260
Go home and take them both with you

14
00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:54.360
I can only do some activities when I go back
