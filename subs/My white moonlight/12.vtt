00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:03.010
Welcome back. Red tray.

2
00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:08.770
Say thank you. Miss this child,

3
00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:10.930
Hidden marriage in the kitchen early in the morning.

4
00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.540
You have to cook a thousand times to be sincere.

5
00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.600
I don’t know if this table of dishes will suit your taste.

6
00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:19.840
Brother Shali, I made this table for you.

7
00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.140
Give it a try. Let's think about it,

8
00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:26.510
Really getting more and more capable. It seems that in the past few years abroad,

9
00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:28.830
Growing up is not stupid. where,

10
00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:34.140
Niannian told me that Zeyuan had taken good care of him in the past few years abroad.

11
00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.530
Come on, have this drink.

12
00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:39.870
Nian Nian married sister

13
00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:41.670
I took care of her and stayed away from home

14
00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.630
Mom knows you like love marriage very much

15
00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:48.300
Your father and I have some common discomforts

16
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.230
But the love marriage has been going on for so long

17
00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.000
It's time for you to let go

18
00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:57.610
I can't let go

19
00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.820
Then mom should just say it directly.

20
00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:04.709
We also grew up together as childhood sweethearts.

21
00:01:04.709 --> 00:01:07.480
I think Nian Nian is a pretty good kid too.

22
00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:11.070
That is, I hope you can get married as soon as possible

23
00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.340
I just think of him as my sister

24
00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.200
Your father means the same thing.

25
00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.410
If you and my dad really like that

26
00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:23.280
You can use him to fuck you

27
00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.480
It's not forcing him to marry someone who doesn't love him

28
00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:28.540
What did you say

29
00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:38.760
I know Brother Lin still can’t let go of his sister

30
00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:41.080
But my buddy wants him to answer

31
00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:42.600
Even if I can't get into my sister's house

32
00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:45.260
I will still go on well

33
00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.060
Ningoli is gone

34
00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:51.600
You will always promise us, Mr.
