The boss took the silver. You test silver.

2
00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:12.740
Stop talking and follow me. Who are you?

3
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:15.600
Hi, I won't see you.

4
00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:21.720
My guy. It's you who made me lose my money.

5
00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:25.970
That little fellow. how?

6
00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:32.439
After a few days, another one was replaced. Brother,

7
00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:35.090
Let’s talk it over. Let’s talk it over again.

8
00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:39.670
Do you know that person?

9
00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:44.410
What about this one? Do you know it?

10
00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.010
For this kind of person who pretends to be a scumbag,

11
00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.020
Don't send it again. I think it's too cheap for him.

12
00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:56.410
I suddenly remembered that he had tried to get rid of me when he kidnapped me.

13
00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.340
Otherwise, he will always hold you in his hands.

14
00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:01.420
good. Yes, yes, yes, yes.

15
00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.810
Really not lying

16
00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:09.620
They all contact me by phone

17
00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:15.160
Can I start the call?

18
00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:17.970
I also want to ask them if they want to disobey.
