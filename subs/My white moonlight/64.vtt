00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.560
This is not necessarily the case. This is how we look at the patient’s ability to recover next Christmas.

2
00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:06.290
If the blood circulation in the brain is completely opened,

3
00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:08.430
He will have more things to do on his own in the future.

4
00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.690
It is recommended that you take him to a familiar place with many people after he is discharged from the hospital.

5
00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:14.030
Walk more.

6
00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:24.530
Thank you. Are you meeting my sister?

7
00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.880
Do you want to hear how I call others?

8
00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.660
I don’t know spring! I want to tell the truth for you.

9
00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:38.980
Clear sky. Do you know it hurts when you hit someone like this? Okay,

10
00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:43.520
What do you want to hear?

11
00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.550
Don't lie to me. Why change the identity of Su Jiuling?

12
00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:55.160
When I found you back then,

13
00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.000
You were seriously injured.

14
00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.620
I didn’t expect that after writing it

15
00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:05.099
Later, your condition became better.

16
00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:07.780
I will take you every day

17
00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.540
until one day

18
00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:13.760
I saw them coming out of seclusion for you

19
00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.870
Obviously the body didn't even grow

20
00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:24.260
It turns out we live in this matter

21
00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:36.640
I want to keep you on my body

22
00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.420
But he didn’t want to make you love him

23
00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:57.920
Come less
