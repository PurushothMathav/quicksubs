00:00:00.466 --> 00:00:01.566
It's over. It's over.

2
00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:04.350
What should I do if it's too late?

3
00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.300
So what's the situation with this Wanjia now?

4
00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:08.950
The master's body is still recovering

5
00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:10.666
But he will use this time

6
00:00:10.666 --> 00:00:12.783
Find someone to rectify the internal forces

7
00:00:12.783 --> 00:00:14.466
Wait until things calm down

8
00:00:14.466 --> 00:00:16.566
I will go back this year

9
00:00:24.433 --> 00:00:26.300
Who is it, sir?

10
00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.166
It's me Yao Wenwen

11
00:00:28.266 --> 00:00:29.833
I'm for these two days

12
00:00:29.833 --> 00:00:31.800
I came here specially to apologize to you.

13
00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:39.100
I wake up in the shower

14
00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:40.250
eldest young master

15
00:00:40.466 --> 00:00:43.200
This set of keys is for me to apologize to you.

16
00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.083
I didn't find what I wanted.

17
00:00:46.033 --> 00:00:47.050
What do you want?

18
00:00:47.066 --> 00:00:50.283
Sir, I have been reflecting on it for the past two days

19
00:00:50.466 --> 00:00:52.166
I shouldn't look down on people

20
00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.650
I shouldn't have offended you

21
00:00:57.033 --> 00:00:58.250
Where's your dog?

22
00:00:58.783 --> 00:01:00.700
Your precious son comes up

23
00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:03.883
Master, are you kidding me again?

24
00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.283
My dog offended one day.

25
00:01:06.433 --> 00:01:08.366
How dare I let him appear in front of you?

26
00:01:09.066 --> 00:01:10.183
Obviously it's human fault

27
00:01:10.183 --> 00:01:11.333
What's your business?

28
00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:14.733
Oops, yeah, yeah, I know it's wrong.

29
00:01:14.783 --> 00:01:17.733
Can you forgive me?

30
00:01:19.233 --> 00:01:20.283
I don't have time right now.

31
00:01:20.866 --> 00:01:22.850
Please go out I don't

32
00:01:22.983 --> 00:01:24.883
I want to hear it from you

33
00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.650
Just say you forgive me, okay?

34
00:01:27.783 --> 00:01:30.650
I heard you are Wanjie's fiancee

35
00:01:30.983 --> 00:01:32.583
You are not good

36
00:01:32.583 --> 00:01:35.733
Gee, I don't want to marry him.

37
00:01:36.783 --> 00:01:38.966
What's wrong my man

38
00:01:38.983 --> 00:01:41.350
I want a man who is upright

39
00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:43.933
At least I have to be like you, young master

40
00:01:44.183 --> 00:01:45.983
You say don't do this

41
00:01:45.983 --> 00:01:48.450
Oh, young master

42
00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.583
Do you dislike me?

43
00:01:50.583 --> 00:01:52.883
I never let Wan Jie touch it

44
00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:54.250
Otherwise

45
00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:56.083
Could you please check it?

46
00:01:56.466 --> 00:02:00.600
Master, how boring are you taking a shower alone?

47
00:02:01.466 --> 00:02:04.050
I will accompany you
