00:00:03.066 --> 00:00:04.866
Yun Shao, this is not good

2
00:00:04.866 --> 00:00:07.233
This is going to kill you, this kid did this to me

3
00:00:07.233 --> 00:00:09.283
I can lie in a hospital bed for the rest of my life

4
00:00:09.383 --> 00:00:12.533
I might, but I wanted him dead that day.

5
00:00:14.066 --> 00:00:16.950
Stop talking nonsense. Didn't you hear what Wei Ze said to you?

6
00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:18.466
I'll give you two days.

7
00:00:18.466 --> 00:00:19.550
Do things for me

8
00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:22.166
Then you will die

9
00:00:28.983 --> 00:00:32.883
Mom and Dad, what are you doing?

10
00:00:33.033 --> 00:00:35.766
Your father said to take me on a trip

11
00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:37.433
Dad, really?

12
00:00:37.433 --> 00:00:39.566
It's been so many years

13
00:00:39.983 --> 00:00:41.300
Is your mother having a hard time?

14
00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.383
I'm also powerless abroad

15
00:00:43.383 --> 00:00:46.283
So I'm going to take your mom out for a walk

16
00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.533
By the way, are you okay with this?

17
00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:51.233
I'm fine. Didn't Yang suggest helping me?

18
00:00:51.233 --> 00:00:53.933
Pick me up when I grow up

19
00:00:54.266 --> 00:00:55.933
Nice boy nice

20
00:00:56.033 --> 00:00:57.100
Are you ambitious?

21
00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.866
Ah, hahaha, that's right.

22
00:00:58.866 --> 00:01:01.866
What about Feng Haicai, why can't I see him recently?

23
00:01:01.866 --> 00:01:03.266
Mr. Feng has been busy recently

24
00:01:03.266 --> 00:01:04.933
Maybe there's no time.

25
00:01:04.983 --> 00:01:06.466
Who is this Feng Hai?

26
00:01:06.466 --> 00:01:07.866
He is domineering

27
00:01:07.866 --> 00:01:10.850
Yang Xin, vice president of the Huaqing Chamber of Commerce

28
00:01:11.033 --> 00:01:12.733
Go back and introduce them to each other

29
00:01:13.266 --> 00:01:16.766
This Feng Haicai doesn't know what he is busy with all day

30
00:01:24.233 --> 00:01:25.366
What's wrong, little fish?

31
00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.333
It's nothing, I'll go out for a while.
