1
00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:02.500
This Jiang Tiansu has a flaw in personality

2
00:00:02.516 --> 00:00:04.366
He doesn't know how to win people's hearts very well

3
00:00:04.466 --> 00:00:06.666
Luo Hai and Huang Wei have long wanted to touch him

4
00:00:06.666 --> 00:00:08.150
He was led to the Hexi pier

5
00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:09.833
Then join forces to besiege him

6
00:00:09.833 --> 00:00:12.316
最后姜天素双拳难敌死守

7
00:00:12.316 --> 00:00:14.000
But this is what happened to him.

8
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.266
As expected

9
00:00:15.266 --> 00:00:16.850
They hurt Xiaoxue like this

10
00:00:17.266 --> 00:00:19.133
Don't worry about driving this.

11
00:00:19.233 --> 00:00:20.200
I can definitely do it

12
00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:21.200
Here's another thing.

13
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.433
How is this Dongxing consortium doing now?

14
00:00:23.433 --> 00:00:24.466
Dongxing consortium

15
00:00:24.466 --> 00:00:26.816
It is very important in the city of Jiangzhou

16
00:00:27.033 --> 00:00:29.600
It's just that there is no leader after this inner red

17
00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.000
Now it's falling apart.

18
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.050
Master, don't you want to

19
00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:34.150
Exactly.

20
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.166
I want to integrate Dongxing Talent Group

21
00:00:36.266 --> 00:00:37.516
Secretary Yang

22
00:00:37.516 --> 00:00:39.616
Is it difficult to do?

23
00:00:39.633 --> 00:00:44.733
Leave this young master to me to handle this matter

24
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.333
This is the vice president, Young Master Feng Haicai

25
00:00:49.516 --> 00:00:51.233
The company has been busy recently.

26
00:00:51.233 --> 00:00:54.366
The first meeting to integrate Dongxing Group

27
00:00:54.516 --> 00:00:58.500
You can leave it to me.

28
00:01:02.266 --> 00:01:03.066
Secretary Yang

29
00:01:03.266 --> 00:01:06.533
This Vice Chairperson Feng has always been like this

30
00:01:06.833 --> 00:01:09.233
他的性格呢确实很古怪

31
00:01:09.233 --> 00:01:12.650
And he doesn't like to be called vice president.

32
00:01:23.466 --> 00:01:24.816
Roll roll roll

33
00:01:25.233 --> 00:01:28.100
You both roll roll roll roll roll hurry hurry

34
00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:29.350
go out

35
00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:31.333
Who?

36
00:01:35.916 --> 00:01:37.800
Dad, why are you hitting me?

37
00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.816
You're such a rebel

38
00:01:41.716 --> 00:01:43.050
Good job you did

39
00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.566
Dad, what are you trying to say?
