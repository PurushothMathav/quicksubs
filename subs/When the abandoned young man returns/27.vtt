00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.350
I told you.

2
00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:03.500
I don't want to go to work in any amount group at all

3
00:00:03.833 --> 00:00:05.216
I can support myself now

4
00:00:05.283 --> 00:00:08.416
Hahaha, you can support yourself.

5
00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.316
You don't even have a job as a security guard anymore

6
00:00:10.316 --> 00:00:11.850
Still out there

7
00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:14.183
If you were honest, you would have no love for us.

8
00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:16.483
Maybe we look at the emotions of that year

9
00:00:16.483 --> 00:00:17.433
Eat less

10
00:00:17.433 --> 00:00:19.500
Well, what do I say?

11
00:00:19.516 --> 00:00:20.533
Don't say anything else

12
00:00:20.716 --> 00:00:23.616
I'll arrange a cleaning for you.

13
00:00:23.833 --> 00:00:25.116
Toilet cleaning work

14
00:00:25.116 --> 00:00:26.233
It's definitely no problem.

15
00:00:26.233 --> 00:00:27.516
I still have the right

16
00:00:27.516 --> 00:00:30.183
Later, I was immersed in the feelings of the year before I came to you

17
00:00:32.233 --> 00:00:34.133
So what if it's too much?

18
00:00:34.716 --> 00:00:35.650
I'll tell you what.

19
00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:38.516
The most worthless thing in this society is emotion

20
00:00:38.516 --> 00:00:41.216
You and I are not the same world anymore

21
00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:42.983
A stalker like you

22
00:00:43.716 --> 00:00:45.650
It's boring. That's right.

23
00:00:46.033 --> 00:00:47.900
I'm really not from the same world

24
00:00:48.483 --> 00:00:49.500
It's time

25
00:00:50.283 --> 00:00:51.933
Later hahaha

26
00:00:52.116 --> 00:00:53.933
Are you kidding?

27
00:00:54.033 --> 00:00:55.383
Who do you think you are?

28
00:00:55.883 --> 00:00:57.400
We've been telling you for so long

29
00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.616
It's already a big face for you.

30
00:01:00.083 --> 00:01:01.783
What qualifications do you have that we can't replace?

31
00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:06.383
Wan Shao

32
00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.133
Wan Shao, you are finally here

33
00:01:14.516 --> 00:01:15.750
How did that happen?

34
00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.200
Isn't this today's bride?

35
00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.550
Why is he called Master Wan Jiaqi?

36
00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:21.700
He's wearing a wedding dress, he must be the bride

37
00:01:21.833 --> 00:01:25.016
Master Wan's surname is Wan Wanjia Qi and his surname is Wan

38
00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:26.783
Could it be that he is
