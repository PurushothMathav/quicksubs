00:00:01.616 --> 00:00:04.116
Hey, poor is poor

2
00:00:04.133 --> 00:00:06.150
How much is a broken stall worth?

3
00:00:06.366 --> 00:00:07.716
How does it hurt him?

4
00:00:07.733 --> 00:00:08.633
Are you rich?

5
00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:10.350
Do whatever you want with money?

6
00:00:10.416 --> 00:00:12.350
It's amazing to have money

7
00:00:13.366 --> 00:00:15.600
I have 100,000 dollars in this card

8
00:00:15.766 --> 00:00:18.066
Whoever helps me get rid of this poor man

9
00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:19.650
The money belongs to him

10
00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:20.250
I'll do it

11
00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.333
Brother, can you give me this money?

12
00:00:22.333 --> 00:00:24.450
Of course, as long as you cripple me

13
00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:26.516
This poor man beat me hard

14
00:00:26.533 --> 00:00:27.716
What's wrong?

15
00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.800
All done, thank you Yunshao, thank you Yunshao for playing

16
00:00:33.933 --> 00:00:36.750
Hahaha stop

17
00:00:40.816 --> 00:00:42.800
Zhang Xue is always you

18
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:43.816
I'm around here.

19
00:00:43.816 --> 00:00:44.866
Are you all right?

20
00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:47.150
Jump surnamed Wan

21
00:00:47.166 --> 00:00:49.266
What a coincidence it is!

22
00:00:49.366 --> 00:00:51.200
You came with your fellow villagers

23
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:52.616
Do you know each other?

24
00:00:52.616 --> 00:00:55.650
It's okay, I heard this stinky dick say it before

25
00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:58.000
As if he were some kind of shit

26
00:00:58.016 --> 00:00:59.250
Deal with girlfriend

27
00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.950
This is a bitch with a dog

28
00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.000
forever.

29
00:01:03.733 --> 00:01:05.266
How to deal with this woman?

30
00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.950
This chick is not bad looking

31
00:01:08.133 --> 00:01:09.916
I'll give it to you, I'll see who dares

32
00:01:10.566 --> 00:01:12.166
My dad is Jiang Tianxia of the Tokyo God of Wealth

33
00:01:12.166 --> 00:01:13.750
I don't care who your father is

34
00:01:13.933 --> 00:01:15.616
How dare you meddle in my own business

35
00:01:15.616 --> 00:01:17.933
I take care of you, what are you?

36
00:01:17.933 --> 00:01:19.150
Talk to me like that

37
00:01:19.216 --> 00:01:21.116
You asked my brother to urge me to call

38
00:01:21.333 --> 00:01:23.300
I fell again what the fuck I wanted happened to my pocket

39
00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:24.550
Hey let me go
