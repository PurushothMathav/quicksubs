00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.350
How do you speak?

2
00:00:01.683 --> 00:00:03.500
Do you know that the customer is God?

3
00:00:03.966 --> 00:00:06.383
I'm just you

4
00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:08.450
You don't look like this

5
00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:11.466
Our store is full of priceless treasures

6
00:00:11.516 --> 00:00:13.050
You poor

7
00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:15.766
At first glance, it is a screw in the factory.

8
00:00:15.766 --> 00:00:16.750
swallow nonsense

9
00:00:17.166 --> 00:00:18.316
I sell barbecues anyway

10
00:00:18.316 --> 00:00:23.083
Oh, it turns out to sell barbecue, hahahaha.

11
00:00:23.083 --> 00:00:25.766
What's the situation in Qingfeng Pavilion now?

12
00:00:25.766 --> 00:00:27.800
Why are all the cats and dogs going in?

13
00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.950
Gao Shao saw no stinky dick

14
00:00:30.966 --> 00:00:34.100
This young master Gao is the eldest young master of the Gao family

15
00:00:34.516 --> 00:00:37.683
The son of the richest man, Mr. Gao Noble

16
00:00:37.683 --> 00:00:39.266
I want to remember correctly

17
00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.350
Your Gao family is bankrupt

18
00:00:44.166 --> 00:00:46.966
You poor man, he doesn't have your say

19
00:00:46.966 --> 00:00:49.316
Our Gao family is a celebrity in Jiangzhou after all

20
00:00:49.316 --> 00:00:50.883
Even if it goes bankrupt

21
00:00:50.883 --> 00:00:53.816
The dead camel is bigger and stronger than you

22
00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:56.166
It's you, get out

23
00:00:56.166 --> 00:00:59.050
Otherwise we'd kick you out

24
00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:00.150
Then again

25
00:01:00.683 --> 00:01:02.050
I'm here to buy something.

26
00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:04.800
I will complain to you for your attitude.

27
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.616
I'm so scared

28
00:01:06.683 --> 00:01:10.366
You come here to buy something, do you know the price here?

29
00:01:10.366 --> 00:01:12.666
The cheapest antique jade bracelet here

30
00:01:12.766 --> 00:01:15.183
Gotta start 500,000

31
00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:17.383
Can you afford that?

32
00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:18.950
If I could afford it
