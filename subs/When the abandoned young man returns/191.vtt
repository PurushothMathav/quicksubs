00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.966
Mr. Feng, although I don't know anything else

2
00:00:02.966 --> 00:00:04.400
But since you can sit

3
00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:05.600
The position of vice president

4
00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:07.683
I guess President Wan will treat you well.

5
00:00:07.683 --> 00:00:10.333
And business wars win or lose

6
00:00:10.333 --> 00:00:11.750
Why do you need this?

7
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.650
Shut up you stinky bitch

8
00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.350
How can you speak?

9
00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:21.183
You say it's too much, I'm too much

10
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:25.783
I am too much

11
00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:28.466
I still remember

12
00:00:29.133 --> 00:00:31.550
My dad used to use a fire

13
00:00:31.966 --> 00:00:34.866
It set fire to our whole house.

14
00:00:34.883 --> 00:00:36.150
Except me.

15
00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:39.150
No one can escape

16
00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:42.033
Every time I look at this scar

17
00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:46.066
The pain I have endured is vividly in my mind

18
00:00:46.683 --> 00:00:48.300
Even that day

19
00:00:48.733 --> 00:00:51.866
I will never meet a woman again

20
00:00:52.483 --> 00:00:53.633
Hahaha

21
00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.233
And what's that like, you know?

22
00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.983
You loser, you don't understand
