1
00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:01.600
Do you have anything to say?

2
00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:03.216
Yeah.

3
00:00:03.683 --> 00:00:06.066
What name would you like to take?

4
00:00:06.166 --> 00:00:07.016
name

5
00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:11.366
70 years old, you are really a noble person who forgets things

6
00:00:11.366 --> 00:00:15.216
Our investment plan was a complete success

7
00:00:15.283 --> 00:00:17.100
The old slave wants to use the funds

8
00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:18.750
Create a large chamber of commerce

9
00:00:18.883 --> 00:00:20.150
Use this money

10
00:00:20.766 --> 00:00:22.266
Invest in the next project

11
00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.300
Then call him Huaqing Chamber of Commerce

12
00:00:25.516 --> 00:00:27.900
What do these two words mean?

13
00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.450
It's always like this

14
00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:32.083
Our goal is to take Wanjia as the root

15
00:00:32.083 --> 00:00:33.916
More than 10,000 houses across Kyushu

16
00:00:33.916 --> 00:00:35.066
Go global

17
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.416
As expected of the eldest young master

18
00:00:37.166 --> 00:00:38.583
You have such grand plans

19
00:00:38.966 --> 00:00:40.783
The old slave must go all out

20
00:00:41.366 --> 00:00:43.550
Say I miss you

21
00:00:44.116 --> 00:00:45.900
What are you talking about?

22
00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:49.266
Oh, by the way, Nie Yuanwu has come down

23
00:00:49.566 --> 00:00:51.383
Someone should take his place

24
00:00:51.883 --> 00:00:53.216
What do you think, sir?

25
00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:54.750
This location

26
00:00:55.316 --> 00:00:56.750
It's a substitute

27
00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.100
Amami Richest

28
00:00:58.566 --> 00:01:00.550
It is a symbol of Amami

29
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.666
This position is indispensable

30
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:04.800
I do have one

31
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.300
Candidate

32
00:01:06.366 --> 00:01:09.816
Who is it? Chen Zhixiong, Chairperson of Dingtai Group
