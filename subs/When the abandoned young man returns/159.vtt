00:00:00.483 --> 00:00:01.583
If I can't afford it

2
00:00:02.116 --> 00:00:02.916
Ha ha.

3
00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.550
Haha, you poor guy is too funny, right?

4
00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:10.716
You can scare me with just a broken card

5
00:00:10.716 --> 00:00:12.700
It's so big, you can see it clearly

6
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.083
This is the Supreme Black Card

7
00:00:14.083 --> 00:00:17.150
Ouch, what about the Supreme Black Card?

8
00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:18.100
As far as I know

9
00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.816
This kind of card cannot appear in Jiangzhou

10
00:00:21.033 --> 00:00:23.550
Boy, you are from Huaxing Chamber of Commerce

11
00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.333
Do you still know the Huaxing Chamber of Commerce?

12
00:00:25.633 --> 00:00:28.733
Yes, I am the young master of Huaxing Chamber of Commerce having an affair

13
00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:32.133
Hahahahaha

14
00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:35.083
Huaxing Chamber of Commerce shit

15
00:00:35.083 --> 00:00:36.433
Just the fucking Huaxing Chamber of Commerce

16
00:00:36.433 --> 00:00:37.600
Made our Gao family go bankrupt

17
00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:38.600
I'll tell you what.

18
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.600
If you are really from Huaxing Chamber of Commerce

19
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.383
I will kill you

20
00:00:44.833 --> 00:00:46.000
I heard you have a new product here.

21
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.900
Or a colorful teapot from the Ming Dynasty?

22
00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:48.750
I want that one.

23
00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:49.433
Bring it to me.

24
00:00:49.433 --> 00:00:51.450
Yo, I didn't expect it.

25
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.716
Is Wu Dalang quite well-informed?

26
00:00:54.716 --> 00:00:55.816
What Wu Dalang

27
00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:57.583
Who? How?

28
00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.883
Doesn't Wu Dalang also sell biscuits?

29
00:00:59.883 --> 00:01:02.150
Hahaha, I sell barbecue.

30
00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:04.300
Don't talk nonsense, it doesn't matter

31
00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.183
It's all trash at the bottom of society anyway

32
00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.333
Also buy a colorful teapot

33
00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.316
Can you afford that?

34
00:01:11.316 --> 00:01:12.616
No matter how much he is

35
00:01:12.833 --> 00:01:14.050
I'm going to order today.
