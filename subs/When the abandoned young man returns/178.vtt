00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:01.300
Are you serious?

2
00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:02.500
Are you really willing to marry me?

3
00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:03.300
OK

4
00:00:03.983 --> 00:00:05.166
Yeah, I heard about that.

5
00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:06.766
Thanks to you this time

6
00:00:07.333 --> 00:00:09.166
Otherwise I decide to go together

7
00:00:09.616 --> 00:00:12.600
Fart you two think I'm stupid

8
00:00:12.816 --> 00:00:15.616
Can vegetative people be cured so easily?

9
00:00:15.616 --> 00:00:17.733
Grandpa, what I said is true

10
00:00:17.733 --> 00:00:19.083
If he hadn't shut up

11
00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:22.083
You and your dad are ugly

12
00:00:22.133 --> 00:00:24.966
Back then, your father insisted on marrying a village girl

13
00:00:25.016 --> 00:00:28.633
You'd better marry such a hillbilly

14
00:00:28.666 --> 00:00:30.483
Grandpa, he's not a country bumpkin

15
00:00:30.583 --> 00:00:32.483
He is the eldest young master of Huaxin Chamber of Commerce

16
00:00:32.533 --> 00:00:34.816
Or did he invite God Yi Ding Wenxiu over?

17
00:00:34.816 --> 00:00:35.983
Just saved me

18
00:00:35.983 --> 00:00:38.700
Hahaha Xiaoxue, Xiaoxue

19
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.566
You really can talk

20
00:00:41.016 --> 00:00:42.983
I've heard of the evil chamber of commerce

21
00:00:42.983 --> 00:00:45.766
That's an international financial consortium

22
00:00:46.133 --> 00:00:49.066
All this poor boy can handle

23
00:00:49.066 --> 00:00:52.566
Grandpa, what I said is true, right?

24
00:00:57.533 --> 00:00:59.916
This is Dr. Joe Hodge

25
00:01:00.216 --> 00:01:02.516
Ding Wenxiu's disciple
