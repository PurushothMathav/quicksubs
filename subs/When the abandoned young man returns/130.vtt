00:00:00.183 --> 00:00:01.916
What are you doing, hillbilly?

2
00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:04.283
President Wan called Master Wan

3
00:00:05.266 --> 00:00:07.700
I am the young man of Master Wan now

4
00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:09.650
I'm really not afraid of being born

5
00:00:10.016 --> 00:00:12.400
Really, I don't know how high the sky is

6
00:00:16.983 --> 00:00:18.916
Master, please come on stage

7
00:00:22.266 --> 00:00:24.916
Is this kid really Master Wan?

8
00:00:25.183 --> 00:00:26.600
Man Yue is not an ordinary person

9
00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:28.816
You don't believe it

10
00:00:28.816 --> 00:00:29.800
Father-in-law

11
00:00:30.016 --> 00:00:30.866
The door broke through

12
00:00:30.866 --> 00:00:31.900
What can we do about this?

13
00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:33.283
You ask Lao Tzu

14
00:00:33.416 --> 00:00:34.666
How do I know

15
00:00:34.666 --> 00:00:36.150
ten thousand less

16
00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:39.150
I am Chaozhen, the head of the Cao family. I hope in the future.

17
00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:40.350
We have a happy cooperation.

18
00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:41.150
Mr. Cao

19
00:00:42.016 --> 00:00:44.350
I'm afraid I don't have that much face

20
00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:45.700
Continue to cooperate with your Cao family

21
00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:47.166
Oh, Master Wan

22
00:00:47.416 --> 00:00:49.383
It was all my fault before

23
00:00:49.383 --> 00:00:51.466
I really didn't know you were Master Wan

24
00:00:51.466 --> 00:00:52.950
He's my son

25
00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:54.566
It's all his good work.

26
00:00:54.666 --> 00:00:56.250
He Yanghe, come up for me

27
00:01:00.416 --> 00:01:02.500
Hello Wan Shao

28
00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:03.616
I was wrong.

29
00:01:03.616 --> 00:01:05.050
I look down on people

30
00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.400
Forgive me, forgive our Cao family

31
00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:10.500
You unfilial son!

32
00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:11.466
It's all you

33
00:01:11.466 --> 00:01:12.500
I offended people

34
00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.400
Damn you
