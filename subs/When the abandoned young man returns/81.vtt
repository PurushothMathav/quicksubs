00:00:00.533 --> 00:00:01.850
Are you kidding me?

2
00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:03.633
You are my uncle's man.

3
00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:04.550
No, no, no.

4
00:00:05.333 --> 00:00:08.733
The head of the family doesn't treat me as his own

5
00:00:08.733 --> 00:00:13.783
Back in the day, Chu Guohui and I served the head of the family together

6
00:00:13.783 --> 00:00:16.516
How crazy is that?

7
00:00:17.016 --> 00:00:18.116
But now

8
00:00:18.133 --> 00:00:21.233
How can I have a blind date with someone?

9
00:00:21.616 --> 00:00:22.683
Little master

10
00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:27.116
We are grasshoppers on a rope now

11
00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:29.833
I have an internal plan

12
00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.916
What's the plan?

13
00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.033
Butler Wan is real or fake

14
00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:40.000
You want to connect most of the new schools together.

15
00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:41.516
Survival of the fittest

16
00:00:41.533 --> 00:00:42.616
Survival of the Fittest

17
00:00:42.616 --> 00:00:44.850
It's a divine law

18
00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.833
The head of the family has been sitting in this position for a long time

19
00:00:49.216 --> 00:00:50.200
sit down

20
00:00:51.616 --> 00:00:53.033
If you are interested

21
00:00:53.333 --> 00:00:57.100
The senior management in the family will support you to rise to the top

22
00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.516
Would you like to

23
00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:01.800
Yes, I do.

24
00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.616
So what should I do?

25
00:01:03.616 --> 00:01:07.183
Our first step is, of course, to get rid of the Wanjia relatives

26
00:01:07.183 --> 00:01:08.716
As for the family?

27
00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:12.283
My people will follow up

28
00:01:12.383 --> 00:01:14.200
Find the right opportunity

29
00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:17.900
Master Wan Jiaqi

30
00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:19.500
There is one by my side except now

31
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.750
And Chen Zhixiong's full support

32
00:01:21.783 --> 00:01:25.200
I'm afraid we're no match for them. What are you afraid of?

33
00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:29.400
What is this?

34
00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:35.216
What is this river collection

35
00:01:35.216 --> 00:01:37.033
Have you heard of the group?

36
00:01:37.133 --> 00:01:39.400
What Jianghe Group?

37
00:01:39.616 --> 00:01:42.500
That is a super first-class economic chamber of commerce overseas.

38
00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.600
Few in the world

39
00:01:44.983 --> 00:01:47.900
Butler Wan, do you know Jianghe Group?

40
00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:49.600
You can understand it this way

41
00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:51.100
That was amazing.

42
00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.450
Resources like Lianghe Group

43
00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.233
You can take control of it.

44
00:01:56.216 --> 00:02:01.600
But Wan Jiaqi, we can't get close

45
00:02:02.933 --> 00:02:04.116
You have to believe

46
00:02:04.816 --> 00:02:09.116
There is no wall in this world that is absolutely airtight

47
00:02:09.216 --> 00:02:12.800
As long as you start with a woman, you can

48
00:02:13.216 --> 00:02:17.033
Who is the woman, hahaha?
