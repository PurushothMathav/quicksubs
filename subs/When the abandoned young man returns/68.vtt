00:00:01.216 --> 00:00:03.733
What took you so long? Nothing happened?

2
00:00:03.733 --> 00:00:06.383
Why don't you worry about embarrassing me by forgetting them?

3
00:00:06.383 --> 00:00:07.416
Since you're fine

4
00:00:07.416 --> 00:00:08.683
I'll take you away

5
00:00:08.933 --> 00:00:11.500
No, I have to go on stage later

6
00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:13.233
Do you mean to say

7
00:00:14.666 --> 00:00:18.000
Hey, didn't this watch break last time?

8
00:00:18.816 --> 00:00:20.600
I fixed it and it still works

9
00:00:21.416 --> 00:00:22.983
This watch is already like this.

10
00:00:22.983 --> 00:00:25.116
I think it's better to get a new one.

11
00:00:25.133 --> 00:00:26.333
Talk about it later

12
00:00:26.333 --> 00:00:28.533
Although this watch is not very valuable

13
00:00:28.533 --> 00:00:30.333
But I always feel like I have to throw it away

14
00:00:30.333 --> 00:00:31.133
Why can't you give up?

15
00:00:32.016 --> 00:00:34.466
Boy, didn't I tell you to get out?

16
00:00:34.466 --> 00:00:35.533
Why are you still here?

17
00:00:35.533 --> 00:00:37.316
Do you really think I'm afraid to do it?

18
00:00:37.416 --> 00:00:38.600
Really let me go

19
00:00:38.866 --> 00:00:40.216
Yeah how

20
00:00:40.216 --> 00:00:41.566
You still have a temper

21
00:00:41.866 --> 00:00:43.266
If I go

22
00:00:43.266 --> 00:00:45.483
You can't do this party

23
00:00:46.616 --> 00:00:49.500
You shouldn't say that you are the eldest young master of the Wan family again, right?

24
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.066
Although Master Wan Jie told me

25
00:00:52.066 --> 00:00:54.316
He has nothing to do with the Wanshang Conference

26
00:00:54.333 --> 00:00:58.033
But it's not your turn to get out of here, Hu Laodao
