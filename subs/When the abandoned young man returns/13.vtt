00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:01.700
Zhu Lao

2
00:00:02.183 --> 00:00:03.150
And this is...

3
00:00:03.183 --> 00:00:06.016
This is Chen Zhixiong, the CEO of Dingtai Group

4
00:00:06.016 --> 00:00:09.250
Yes, it was Chen who sued Wanjia in Beijing to solve the problem.

5
00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:11.333
I heard that Chu Lao came to reclaim the sea

6
00:00:11.333 --> 00:00:12.283
Specially come to visit

7
00:00:12.733 --> 00:00:13.900
Our eldest young master

8
00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:17.383
He was the biological son who had been lost in the family for many years

9
00:00:17.383 --> 00:00:20.400
But the one you just mentioned is not the same as Jie Shao

10
00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:22.800
Ah, so this is Hall Master Chen

11
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.250
The eldest young master Chen is straightforward

12
00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:26.933
Please don't mind.

13
00:00:26.933 --> 00:00:29.333
Chen Zhixiong, this seems to be Amami Mountain Mansion

14
00:00:29.333 --> 00:00:30.800
Add a thousand people to your hand

15
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.200
The dignified underground emperor

16
00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:33.250
So believable to us

17
00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:34.016
eldest young master

18
00:00:34.016 --> 00:00:35.983
We have nothing to give away when we meet for the first time

19
00:00:35.983 --> 00:00:37.650
I have a purple gold card here

20
00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:38.983
There is a 10 million quota in it

21
00:00:38.983 --> 00:00:41.616
In addition, Chen's industries are all over Cheonan

22
00:00:41.616 --> 00:00:43.883
You can spend whatever you want with this card.

23
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.600
10 million maybe

24
00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:47.433
How much and what's the situation?

25
00:00:47.533 --> 00:00:49.133
A mere 10 million

26
00:00:49.133 --> 00:00:51.950
Not even a fraction of our 10,000 assets

27
00:00:55.616 --> 00:00:57.316
Hmm Wan Jiaqi

28
00:00:57.333 --> 00:00:58.250
Come back to me now

29
00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:00.033
Take all your junk luggage away from me

30
00:01:01.816 --> 00:01:03.533
What happened to the eldest young master?

31
00:01:03.533 --> 00:01:04.933
Why don't this surname Liu call me?

32
00:01:04.933 --> 00:01:06.033
I almost forgot.

33
00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:07.133
I have something very important

34
00:01:07.133 --> 00:01:08.233
I'm taking it back.
