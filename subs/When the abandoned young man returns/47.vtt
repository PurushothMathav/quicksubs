00:00:00.216 --> 00:00:01.950
Say who sent you

2
00:00:07.816 --> 00:00:10.066
Chubby, you are so amazing

3
00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:12.550
They are he dead

4
00:00:12.816 --> 00:00:13.833
Probably lost

5
00:00:16.566 --> 00:00:18.483
What's the matter, Mr. Wan? What happened?

6
00:00:18.483 --> 00:00:21.216
Eagle, someone assassinated Mr. Wan

7
00:00:21.216 --> 00:00:23.483
What's so ambitious?

8
00:00:23.483 --> 00:00:26.133
Nine times out of ten it was Wanjie

9
00:00:26.133 --> 00:00:28.866
His family has the guts to attack Miss Yang

10
00:00:29.483 --> 00:00:31.416
The Wu parents will put a million calamities

11
00:00:31.416 --> 00:00:33.333
You really don't know the sky is high and the earth is thick

12
00:00:33.333 --> 00:00:34.850
Mr. Wan, please send a message.

13
00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:36.550
I'll send someone to kill him

14
00:00:36.816 --> 00:00:37.833
That's my guess.

15
00:00:38.216 --> 00:00:39.850
I have no evidence that he must have done it.

16
00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:41.016
In that case

17
00:00:41.016 --> 00:00:43.250
Mr. Wan, your side is too dangerous

18
00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:45.550
Do you want me to send a nice brother like you?

19
00:00:45.616 --> 00:00:46.966
Keep you safe at all times

20
00:00:46.966 --> 00:00:47.766
not sick

21
00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:49.916
I'm not a delicate person

22
00:00:50.166 --> 00:00:52.716
Besides, there are more people around

23
00:00:53.216 --> 00:00:54.516
There will inevitably be problems

24
00:00:55.966 --> 00:00:57.150
But let's be honest

25
00:00:57.883 --> 00:01:00.866
I really want to see someone again

26
00:01:01.133 --> 00:01:01.933
Yang Jin

27
00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:03.250
Yang Xiaoxin
