00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:02.900
What's going on?

2
00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:04.700
Mr. Fan, you are finally here

3
00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:07.183
Just these turtle boys can't come up with the money

4
00:00:07.183 --> 00:00:09.083
I still don't want to see this colorful teapot

5
00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:09.583
Yes!

6
00:00:09.583 --> 00:00:12.133
Old Fan also took out a broken card

7
00:00:12.133 --> 00:00:13.450
I don't know the sky is high and the earth is thick

8
00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:15.716
He thought 50 million was a decimal number

9
00:00:15.783 --> 00:00:19.183
Xiaoyong multicolored teapot and extraordinary products

10
00:00:19.183 --> 00:00:20.650
I just started too

11
00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:22.500
Where did you get the news from?

12
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:23.700
Don't worry about that.

13
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:25.616
50 million for your teapot, right?

14
00:00:25.616 --> 00:00:27.500
Don't forget it.

15
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:28.983
Don't talk nonsense for him

16
00:00:28.983 --> 00:00:31.016
This kid is sneaky

17
00:00:31.016 --> 00:00:32.650
I guess he just wanted to steal something

18
00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:35.350
If I say this 50 million

19
00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.550
If you can afford to lose, what do you want?

20
00:00:37.616 --> 00:00:40.150
If you lose this 50 million, you still lose

21
00:00:40.216 --> 00:00:41.800
Hahahaha

22
00:00:42.533 --> 00:00:46.250
Good boy since you want to die

23
00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:47.750
Then I'll play with you

24
00:00:47.983 --> 00:00:49.500
If you lose

25
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.400
I'll break your damn legs

26
00:00:51.416 --> 00:00:52.216
Good idea.

27
00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:53.800
Take it for capital verification

28
00:00:54.583 --> 00:00:57.600
Go and see how much money is in the card

29
00:01:00.933 --> 00:01:04.116
Boy, I'll see how you die later
