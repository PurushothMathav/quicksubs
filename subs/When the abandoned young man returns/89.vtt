00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:05.466
Xiaoqi Xiaoqi

2
00:00:05.733 --> 00:00:07.733
Don't shout here

3
00:00:07.733 --> 00:00:10.300
If you scream your throat, no one will come to your rescue.

4
00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:11.966
What does Xiao Wang mean?

5
00:00:11.966 --> 00:00:13.033
You did it on purpose

6
00:00:13.083 --> 00:00:15.400
I'm so sorry, I lied to you.

7
00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:16.783
Actually, I didn't misunderstand at all

8
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.166
I don't believe you.

9
00:00:18.166 --> 00:00:19.583
You actually lied to me

10
00:00:29.533 --> 00:00:31.383
How do you say

11
00:00:31.533 --> 00:00:33.066
Those who know the current affairs are Junjie

12
00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:36.350
I thought you were the pillar of the Wan family.

13
00:00:36.766 --> 00:00:39.533
I didn't expect you to be a fart

14
00:00:39.533 --> 00:00:42.950
You wasted so much of my time. What are you talking about?

15
00:00:42.966 --> 00:00:44.766
Did you know that we founded the Huaxin Chamber of Commerce?

16
00:00:44.766 --> 00:00:45.783
Coming soon.

17
00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:46.766
Then it will radiate to the whole country.

18
00:00:46.766 --> 00:00:48.666
It's not impossible to go to all the staff.

19
00:00:49.883 --> 00:00:52.850
Really? About the assessment period?

20
00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:54.050
What assessment period?

21
00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:55.900
Stop talking nonsense with him

22
00:00:56.933 --> 00:00:59.066
Yes, yes, yes too.

23
00:00:59.566 --> 00:01:00.400
Wanjiaqi

24
00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.350
You're dead. You don't know that yet, do you?

25
00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:06.750
What are you doing when you're dying?

26
00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:12.083
Tell me, now I've lost everything to you

27
00:01:12.083 --> 00:01:13.866
How are you going to compensate me?

28
00:01:14.133 --> 00:01:15.950
You asked for it yourself

29
00:01:18.133 --> 00:01:20.666
Do you think the rich family is so easy to mix?

30
00:01:20.733 --> 00:01:22.266
Like a hillbilly like you

31
00:01:22.566 --> 00:01:25.066
I don't know how I died in it

32
00:01:25.366 --> 00:01:28.833
Why is Mr. Nie so atmospheric?

33
00:01:28.883 --> 00:01:31.033
Introduce you here you are

34
00:01:31.766 --> 00:01:32.700
Myriad Calamities

35
00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:34.600
You are here too

36
00:01:34.883 --> 00:01:37.433
The Coloring Killer was also sent by you

37
00:01:37.483 --> 00:01:39.400
So what if it's me?

38
00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.733
That's all right, thanks to you woman

39
00:01:41.733 --> 00:01:44.666
Otherwise, how could we catch you so easily?

40
00:01:44.683 --> 00:01:48.233
Oh, Wan Shao, you are so annoying, Xiao Wenwen

41
00:01:48.883 --> 00:01:50.233
I still want to be responsible for you.

42
00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:51.833
I'll give you what you want.

43
00:01:51.966 --> 00:01:53.633
I really misjudged you.
