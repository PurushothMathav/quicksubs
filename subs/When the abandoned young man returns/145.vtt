00:00:00.883 --> 00:00:04.016
Who yells so loudly and dares to coax Lao Tzu's woman?

2
00:00:04.683 --> 00:00:05.616
Dear

3
00:00:06.283 --> 00:00:07.633
It's finally here.

4
00:00:07.633 --> 00:00:08.900
Let me tell you something.

5
00:00:08.916 --> 00:00:11.200
Here are a few eyeless things

6
00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.316
Not only don't take you seriously

7
00:00:13.316 --> 00:00:16.900
I don't even care about Huaxin International

8
00:00:17.033 --> 00:00:19.616
Xiurou, don't go too far

9
00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:22.100
I'm too much

10
00:00:22.116 --> 00:00:24.216
Aren't you arrogant?

11
00:00:24.316 --> 00:00:27.650
Forget it, you dare to move my woman

12
00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:29.516
He insulted people first

13
00:00:29.516 --> 00:00:32.400
Stop talking nonsense and apologize to Xiao Luo quickly

14
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.016
You are from Huaxin International

15
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.916
How could Huaxin International have a scum like you?

16
00:00:35.916 --> 00:00:37.000
Lawlessness, right?

17
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.933
I'm lawless

18
00:00:39.316 --> 00:00:40.183
Where are you going?

19
00:00:40.683 --> 00:00:42.300
I'm from the PR department

20
00:00:42.516 --> 00:00:44.900
And you shit

21
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.900
Oh, Qingyuan Technology still wants to cooperate with us.

22
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.933
Why don't you two kneel down

23
00:00:52.316 --> 00:00:53.200
I am happy

24
00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.650
Well, I'll think about it.

25
00:00:55.316 --> 00:00:57.216
The person who knows the current affairs is Junjie

26
00:00:57.233 --> 00:00:58.633
What if I were you?

27
00:00:58.633 --> 00:00:59.933
So I fell to my knees.

28
00:01:00.083 --> 00:01:01.016
Don't kneel yet

29
00:01:03.283 --> 00:01:04.450
Yuan Zhou, right?

30
00:01:04.833 --> 00:01:06.900
You're a little PR manager

31
00:01:07.233 --> 00:01:09.250
What qualifications do you have to cooperate with the company?

32
00:01:09.433 --> 00:01:11.933
Just because my backstage is

33
00:01:12.633 --> 00:01:14.983
Mr. Yang, is that true, dear?

34
00:01:15.083 --> 00:01:17.083
I have also heard of this Mr. Yang

35
00:01:17.083 --> 00:01:18.200
I heard that the background is not small

36
00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.133
It seems to be the secretary general of the Huaqing Chamber of Commerce

37
00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.416
If you really have that ability

38
00:01:22.833 --> 00:01:25.533
Give you a chance to call Ma On Shan over and show me
