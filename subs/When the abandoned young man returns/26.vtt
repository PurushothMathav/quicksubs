00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:03.283
Why does that name sound familiar?

2
00:00:03.283 --> 00:00:05.016
It's you, it's me

3
00:00:05.516 --> 00:00:06.716
I heard you two

4
00:00:06.716 --> 00:00:08.250
He is the best among his colleagues

5
00:00:08.633 --> 00:00:09.783
I'm so happy for you

6
00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:11.983
Hahaha

7
00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:14.350
It turns out that you are so painstaking

8
00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:16.283
Just to get along with us

9
00:00:16.283 --> 00:00:17.900
Get something from us

10
00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:19.983
That's okay.

11
00:00:20.683 --> 00:00:21.433
I don't have it.

12
00:00:21.433 --> 00:00:24.133
I am also the general manager of Qinghe Group

13
00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.216
Xiaoxue has also been promoted to the head of the sales department

14
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:27.950
You

15
00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:30.800
He must have heard the news and wanted to approach us, right?

16
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.500
I said he was a misunderstanding

17
00:00:32.716 --> 00:00:34.100
I didn't know you were here.

18
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.533
Wan Jiaqi, stop pretending

19
00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.883
What is your job now?

20
00:00:39.883 --> 00:00:40.950
What kind of treatment?

21
00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.300
I used to work as a security guard

22
00:00:44.433 --> 00:00:45.483
Not working for now

23
00:00:45.483 --> 00:00:47.333
Haha security

24
00:00:47.716 --> 00:00:48.833
What security guard?

25
00:00:48.833 --> 00:00:50.383
Isn't it the one who opens the door?

26
00:00:50.633 --> 00:00:52.516
You can't even do your job as a security guard

27
00:00:52.516 --> 00:00:54.383
Do you still want to join Qinghe Group?

28
00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:55.883
Isn't that easy?

29
00:00:55.883 --> 00:00:58.983
Like I said, I don't want to be emotionally ill.

30
00:00:59.033 --> 00:01:00.450
You can support yourself now.
