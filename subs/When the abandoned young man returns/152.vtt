00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:06.300
How's it going today?

2
00:00:06.566 --> 00:00:08.683
Master Wan's situation is not optimistic

3
00:00:08.683 --> 00:00:10.850
Miss Jiang's head was severely injured

4
00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:13.016
I'm afraid I might wake up

5
00:00:13.316 --> 00:00:15.516
Wake up can wake up

6
00:00:15.516 --> 00:00:16.866
Master, calm down

7
00:00:18.566 --> 00:00:19.316
It's the following.

8
00:00:19.316 --> 00:00:21.316
The situation at the junction of the river is rather special

9
00:00:21.316 --> 00:00:23.666
What might become a vegetable?

10
00:00:23.716 --> 00:00:24.850
Then you think of a way

11
00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:25.516
You try it.

12
00:00:25.516 --> 00:00:26.466
You are responsible

13
00:00:26.683 --> 00:00:27.966
There is a way

14
00:00:27.966 --> 00:00:30.800
Just say I can do anything

15
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.416
Okay, okay, okay.

16
00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:33.650
Doctor Ding, do you know?

17
00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:35.483
If he's willing to help

18
00:00:35.483 --> 00:00:37.500
There may be a turnaround

19
00:00:38.316 --> 00:00:39.616
Ding Wenxiu, right?

20
00:00:39.683 --> 00:00:41.000
I saw him on TV.

21
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.966
I heard that his medical skills are first-class in the whole agricultural country

22
00:00:43.966 --> 00:00:46.516
Yes, Dr. Ding lives in Jiangzhou now

23
00:00:46.516 --> 00:00:48.400
It's just that he already said it

24
00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.183
I will no longer see patients and save people in the future

25
00:00:50.716 --> 00:00:52.583
It's okay, I'll find a way.

26
00:00:53.366 --> 00:00:54.183
Thank you for saying it.

27
00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:55.250
Okay

28
00:00:56.316 --> 00:00:59.383
Bring me Dr. Ding's information immediately. Yes
