1
00:00:00.583 --> 00:00:01.616
Misunderstood me

2
00:00:01.616 --> 00:00:04.666
You didn't touch him at all. Get out of here

3
00:00:04.666 --> 00:00:06.900
Otherwise, I'll call security to invite you

4
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:08.016
You weren't like this when you were in school

5
00:00:08.016 --> 00:00:09.616
Don't compare with me

6
00:00:09.616 --> 00:00:10.716
We don't know each other well.

7
00:00:10.733 --> 00:00:12.616
Customers are gods, don't you understand?

8
00:00:12.616 --> 00:00:15.033
If you have the ability of Cao Cao

9
00:00:15.183 --> 00:00:16.833
I dare not offend you.

10
00:00:16.933 --> 00:00:18.283
Do you have the ability?

11
00:00:20.266 --> 00:00:21.166
Look good.

12
00:00:22.333 --> 00:00:23.566
I am also the owner.

13
00:00:25.216 --> 00:00:27.766
This is the key to Villa 1

14
00:00:27.783 --> 00:00:30.783
That's a half-billion dollar house.

15
00:00:30.783 --> 00:00:32.116
This is your house.

16
00:00:32.266 --> 00:00:34.200
Not bad I bah

17
00:00:34.466 --> 00:00:36.266
I don't know your details yet

18
00:00:36.266 --> 00:00:39.133
You are a stinky cabbage. Where did you get the money?

19
00:00:39.133 --> 00:00:42.133
Tell me where this key was stolen from

20
00:00:42.133 --> 00:00:43.316
Don't falsely accuse people

21
00:00:43.533 --> 00:00:44.616
This is what my dad gave me

22
00:00:44.616 --> 00:00:47.833
Hahahaha, you want to laugh me to death?

23
00:00:48.133 --> 00:00:50.100
Your goddamn dad

24
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.600
Didn't you abandon your mother since you were young?

25
00:00:52.616 --> 00:00:54.316
Where did you get your dad?

26
00:00:54.466 --> 00:00:58.233
I'm not the wild man your mother found, am I?

27
00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:59.333
How come?

28
00:00:59.333 --> 00:01:00.566
What do you want?
