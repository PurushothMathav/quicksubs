00:00:00.483 --> 00:00:01.600
What do you mean?

2
00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:02.916
What's wrong with this diamond ring?

3
00:00:02.916 --> 00:00:04.700
This is the musai and the fire diamond ring.

4
00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:07.116
I got it at Phillips Auction

5
00:00:07.116 --> 00:00:08.883
It's worth 5 million dollars

6
00:00:08.883 --> 00:00:10.700
Wow, really?

7
00:00:10.966 --> 00:00:13.250
This shit is worth 5 million

8
00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:14.683
Fucking rice pick up

9
00:00:14.683 --> 00:00:15.750
Of course!

10
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.900
You don't even believe your husband anymore

11
00:00:19.516 --> 00:00:21.500
This is what I gave to President Wan

12
00:00:21.516 --> 00:00:23.800
Why are you here today?

13
00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.266
Did I say that?

14
00:00:25.516 --> 00:00:28.483
It turns out that you are not only a poor boy

15
00:00:28.483 --> 00:00:30.166
And a goddamn thief?

16
00:00:30.166 --> 00:00:32.366
Even the things my father gave to President Wan

17
00:00:32.366 --> 00:00:33.350
You dare to steal

18
00:00:33.716 --> 00:00:35.383
Do you not want to live?

19
00:00:36.966 --> 00:00:38.066
Who said I stole it?

20
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:39.816
This is what my dad gave me

21
00:00:40.166 --> 00:00:41.216
Your dad

22
00:00:41.366 --> 00:00:44.200
Are you trying to say that President Wan is your father?

23
00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:45.016
Nice

24
00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:48.116
Ha, I'm dying of laughter.

25
00:00:48.116 --> 00:00:49.916
If President Wan were your father

26
00:00:49.916 --> 00:00:51.666
I knelt down and learned to assist

27
00:00:51.916 --> 00:00:53.866
That's what you said yourself

28
00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:55.700
But if you're bragging

29
00:00:55.766 --> 00:00:58.400
See if I don't beat you into a dead dog

30
00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:59.350
Bring something

31
00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:01.450
Hey

32
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:03.800
Manyue

33
00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:06.066
Are you all right?

34
00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:08.100
Mr. Jiang

35
00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:09.966
Who are you?

36
00:01:09.966 --> 00:01:11.683
He is not professional

37
00:01:11.683 --> 00:01:13.716
This is not to lower the courage of your East-West consortium.

38
00:01:13.716 --> 00:01:14.716
Is it child? No.

39
00:01:14.716 --> 00:01:15.600
You misunderstood

40
00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.783
Wan Yue, please explain to them quickly

41
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.266
I have explained

42
00:01:19.883 --> 00:01:21.016
They can't do it themselves

43
00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:22.950
You're gonna pay, son

44
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.466
I've put up with you for a long time

45
00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.366
A person of the level of President Wan

46
00:01:26.366 --> 00:01:27.483
I can't even afford it.

47
00:01:27.483 --> 00:01:28.616
What are you?

48
00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.583
Granny Jiang, don't worry.

49
00:01:30.916 --> 00:01:32.400
Wait a minute, President Wan will come

50
00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.816
I see how long this kid can live

51
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.966
Dad, do you think so?

52
00:01:36.966 --> 00:01:39.616
Not bad, I've never seen this President Wan

53
00:01:39.716 --> 00:01:40.983
I have to be someone too

54
00:01:43.116 --> 00:01:44.100
Why?

55
00:01:48.966 --> 00:01:52.100
Why does this person look so familiar?
