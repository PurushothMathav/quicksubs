00:00:01.616 --> 00:00:02.583
Early Elder

2
00:00:02.583 --> 00:00:04.533
You just happened to be him.

3
00:00:04.533 --> 00:00:06.016
I don't know where he got in from

4
00:00:06.016 --> 00:00:08.233
He also relied on Chen Zhixiong's people to support him

5
00:00:08.416 --> 00:00:10.933
Otherwise, I would have broken his dog leg long ago

6
00:00:10.933 --> 00:00:11.733
Oh.

7
00:00:12.383 --> 00:00:13.766
Is it the first old

8
00:00:14.016 --> 00:00:16.266
This has nothing to do with Mr. Wan

9
00:00:16.266 --> 00:00:17.466
Find me if you want

10
00:00:17.466 --> 00:00:20.633
Don't worry about fairness, he can't move

11
00:00:20.866 --> 00:00:22.283
Chu Lao, did you see it?

12
00:00:22.466 --> 00:00:23.266
I don't know they are Dingtai

13
00:00:23.266 --> 00:00:24.616
Where did the group go wrong?

14
00:00:24.616 --> 00:00:26.000
Gotta protect this wimp

15
00:00:26.216 --> 00:00:27.500
My brain is flooded too

16
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:28.866
How could you fall in love with such a person?

17
00:00:28.866 --> 00:00:30.133
Fortunately, it didn't go further.

18
00:00:30.133 --> 00:00:31.300
Otherwise, if it gets out

19
00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.183
You're going to lose face next time

20
00:00:33.183 --> 00:00:34.933
This guy is outspoken

21
00:00:34.933 --> 00:00:38.066
If you let Elder Chu know how you treat him

22
00:00:38.066 --> 00:00:38.983
Tell me about it.

23
00:00:38.983 --> 00:00:40.166
It's easy to beat him

24
00:00:40.266 --> 00:00:42.400
This kid is dead

25
00:00:44.133 --> 00:00:45.400
What did you just say?

26
00:00:46.133 --> 00:00:47.616
Who are you calling trash?

27
00:00:47.616 --> 00:00:50.000
I said he was trash

28
00:00:51.333 --> 00:00:53.783
How dare you say that our eldest young master is trash

29
00:00:53.783 --> 00:00:55.516
How dare you!
