00:00:00.216 --> 00:00:03.050
It was all my fault before the eldest young master

2
00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:04.366
I came to apologize to you

3
00:00:04.366 --> 00:00:05.666
You humiliated me so much before

4
00:00:05.683 --> 00:00:06.850
Now run over and apologize

5
00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:08.516
It's late, sir

6
00:00:08.616 --> 00:00:10.366
I didn't know your identity before

7
00:00:10.366 --> 00:00:11.283
I was wrong.

8
00:00:11.283 --> 00:00:12.816
I was really wrong, just forgive me once.

9
00:00:12.816 --> 00:00:13.683
What do you mean?

10
00:00:13.683 --> 00:00:16.233
Those ordinary people can bully people at will

11
00:00:16.683 --> 00:00:17.733
I don't go out high

12
00:00:17.733 --> 00:00:19.050
You bullies

13
00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.383
I don't want to see you for a moment

14
00:00:26.733 --> 00:00:28.333
How is the sun?

15
00:00:28.333 --> 00:00:29.833
So delicious I used to

16
00:00:30.483 --> 00:00:32.083
I have never eaten anything so delicious

17
00:00:32.083 --> 00:00:32.766
Big Sun

18
00:00:32.766 --> 00:00:34.933
What else do you need to do in your career now?

19
00:00:34.933 --> 00:00:37.766
Then I will take you back to the capital to see your wife

20
00:00:37.766 --> 00:00:40.433
Well, you go to work first, don't worry about me.

21
00:00:49.933 --> 00:00:51.750
So this is the life of the rich.

22
00:00:53.016 --> 00:00:53.983
So rich

23
00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:59.283
Who dares to be my master and don't want to live anymore?

24
00:00:59.283 --> 00:01:00.083
What do you mean?

25
00:01:00.083 --> 00:01:02.333
I got dirty because I didn't open the way

26
00:01:02.333 --> 00:01:03.816
You look familiar.

27
00:01:03.816 --> 00:01:05.083
Who are you?

28
00:01:05.083 --> 00:01:07.133
Do you remember last night at the bar?

29
00:01:07.133 --> 00:01:08.083
You let people hit me

30
00:01:08.083 --> 00:01:08.883
OK

31
00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:12.650
Look at the door of that bar yesterday, you came here

32
00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:13.650
What are we doing at home?

33
00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.683
Our family is not going to see that baby

34
00:01:15.683 --> 00:01:18.733
Who said I'm here to be a security guard, not a security guard?

35
00:01:18.733 --> 00:01:20.016
Still here to be a nanny

36
00:01:20.016 --> 00:01:22.933
That's good, you dirty my floor.

37
00:01:22.933 --> 00:01:25.066
You lick me clean with your mouth

38
00:01:25.083 --> 00:01:26.050
Then if I hire you

39
00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:29.383
Yo, the boy has a good temper, if you refuse

40
00:01:29.566 --> 00:01:32.750
I don't mind letting yesterday happen again

41
00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.266
Ha ha.

42
00:01:34.816 --> 00:01:37.050
Hahahaha, don't go too far.

43
00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:38.866
I curse too much

44
00:01:38.933 --> 00:01:40.333
I have this qualification.

45
00:01:40.333 --> 00:01:42.533
Master, I am from Wanjia in the capital

46
00:01:42.533 --> 00:01:44.033
Wanjia, I let you stand

47
00:01:44.333 --> 00:01:46.433
You have to stand. I want you to lie down

48
00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:47.983
You have to lie down

49
00:01:48.133 --> 00:01:51.183
Do you know, Sister Wan, stop
