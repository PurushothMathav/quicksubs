00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:03.450
Seen ten thousand kinds

2
00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:13.466
I have been working abroad for so many years

3
00:00:13.466 --> 00:00:14.633
Huaxin Chamber of Commerce

4
00:00:14.633 --> 00:00:17.233
Finally become the world's leading super consortium

5
00:00:17.233 --> 00:00:18.333
What a pity!

6
00:00:18.433 --> 00:00:21.233
I have no successor for such a big industry

7
00:00:21.233 --> 00:00:22.033
Yang Xin

8
00:00:22.233 --> 00:00:25.650
Are you sure my wife and children are in Jiangzhou?

9
00:00:26.316 --> 00:00:28.016
This paternity test report

10
00:00:28.316 --> 00:00:29.300
Please take a look.

11
00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:31.133
Have you relied on it?

12
00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:32.266
Please rest assured.

13
00:00:32.266 --> 00:00:33.850
If I hadn't gotten this report

14
00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:36.100
I'm afraid we can't find the lady and the master either

15
00:00:37.066 --> 00:00:37.966
only

16
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.166
Tell me, president, you are now the richest man in Kyushu

17
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.933
They monopolized the world's financial industry and real estate

18
00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:47.250
But the lady and the young master live very clearly

19
00:00:47.266 --> 00:00:49.100
The young master is setting up a stall to sell barbecues

20
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.166
And the lady is helping someone wash the dishes

21
00:00:52.233 --> 00:00:54.600
I'm sorry to invite them.

22
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.050
It's really not easy for him to raise the child alone

23
00:00:57.433 --> 00:01:01.016
I must make up for the regrets of that year when I return to China this time.

24
00:01:08.066 --> 00:01:08.316
Hello

25
00:01:08.316 --> 00:01:10.516
Hurry up, dawdle, okay, okay, okay, right away

26
00:01:10.516 --> 00:01:12.300
I'm too busy to come

27
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:18.800
Thank you. Thank you.

28
00:01:19.666 --> 00:01:21.450
Come right away, come right away, come right away

29
00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:31.550
Handsome guy eats meat skewers, okay, okay, okay

30
00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:33.816
Business is really good these days.

31
00:01:35.066 --> 00:01:36.133
Go on like this

32
00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.250
It won't be long before it can be cancelled.

33
00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.616
Honey, why don't you get a room?

34
00:01:43.666 --> 00:01:47.300
How nice of so many people to come and go

35
00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:53.366
Isn't this Xiao Xiao's car?

36
00:01:53.916 --> 00:01:54.716
I'll stop here.
