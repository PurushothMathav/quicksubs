00:00:00.216 --> 00:00:01.083
What young master

2
00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:02.983
Who are you calling? You are our eldest young master

3
00:00:02.983 --> 00:00:04.816
We worked so hard and I found it

4
00:00:04.816 --> 00:00:05.900
Are you lying?

5
00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:07.500
I am an aunt

6
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.466
No, no, you got lost when you were 3 years old

7
00:00:10.466 --> 00:00:12.216
Madam, because you are blind from crying

8
00:00:12.216 --> 00:00:13.666
Died after half a year

9
00:00:13.666 --> 00:00:15.416
Fortunately, grandpa has been insisting.

10
00:00:15.416 --> 00:00:17.116
We finally found you

11
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:18.100
We continue to edit

12
00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:19.700
If you really don't believe it

13
00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:21.000
We have other evidence

14
00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.050
You might as well take a look with us.

15
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.316
Teacher Sheng Genting Tiangong

16
00:00:27.016 --> 00:00:32.566
Barracks, I'm not going home if I'm not drunk today, oops

17
00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:35.050
Stop talking

18
00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:36.816
Have a good rest.

19
00:00:36.816 --> 00:00:37.616
drink

20
00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:39.150
Wow

21
00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.466
This is really cloudy sky.

22
00:00:41.466 --> 00:00:43.383
I heard this place is made of tree fields

23
00:00:43.383 --> 00:00:45.283
Every inch of land is expensive, young master

24
00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:48.283
The whole estate here is ours

25
00:00:51.783 --> 00:00:53.516
Master, please take a seat first

26
00:00:54.616 --> 00:00:56.650
Master, please eat some food first

27
00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:57.916
I'm going to eat.

28
00:01:03.183 --> 00:01:06.483
Hey, you stinky security guard, what are you doing here?

29
00:01:06.666 --> 00:01:08.000
How is it you?

30
00:01:08.783 --> 00:01:11.583
I want to ask you, you come here in the middle of the night

31
00:01:11.583 --> 00:01:14.150
You're not here to steal, are you?

32
00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:15.900
I didn't steal anything, you piece of crap

33
00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.166
Don't admit it, right?

34
00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:19.466
What is this, explain it to me.

35
00:01:19.466 --> 00:01:22.050
I eat a banana, why do you still have the face to say

36
00:01:22.216 --> 00:01:23.266
trespassing

37
00:01:23.266 --> 00:01:26.383
And steal our food, I'm going to call the police to arrest you

38
00:01:26.383 --> 00:01:27.400
I didn't break into the house

39
00:01:27.416 --> 00:01:28.766
It was an old gentleman who took me to buy

40
00:01:30.216 --> 00:01:31.350
Which old man?

41
00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.466
Are you talking about the young old man?

42
00:01:33.466 --> 00:01:36.566
The whole manor is only burning big seats at the age of young and old

43
00:01:38.983 --> 00:01:40.750
It seems to be called Chu Guohui

44
00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:42.550
You really don't know the sky is high and the earth is thick

45
00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:44.183
Do you know where Chu Lao came from?

46
00:01:44.183 --> 00:01:45.850
How dare you defend his name

47
00:01:45.866 --> 00:01:47.016
I'll tell you the truth.

48
00:01:47.016 --> 00:01:48.150
My dear

49
00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:50.016
That is the rich second generation of Wanjia in the capital

50
00:01:50.016 --> 00:01:53.066
This is the left treasure of the head of the Wan family

51
00:01:53.066 --> 00:01:54.616
Even my dear dare not offend him

52
00:01:54.616 --> 00:01:56.266
Are you impatient?

53
00:01:56.266 --> 00:01:57.500
What's so great about the rich second generation?

54
00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.083
The first elder also said that I was the eldest young master of Wan Family
