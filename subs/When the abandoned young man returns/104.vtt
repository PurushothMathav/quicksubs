00:00:14.316 --> 00:00:16.350
This is where their mother and son live

2
00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.233
Yes, what about the conditions?

3
00:00:18.233 --> 00:00:19.616
Did pick up my money

4
00:00:19.716 --> 00:00:21.783
I'll take you in first, no need

5
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:22.950
You wait for me here.

6
00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:25.933
I'm afraid I'll scare him by going in like this

7
00:00:34.683 --> 00:00:35.483
Hey

8
00:00:36.116 --> 00:00:36.916
And so forth.

9
00:00:37.516 --> 00:00:38.916
Are you Xiaoyue?

10
00:00:38.916 --> 00:00:41.300
Who are you? I'm your dad

11
00:00:41.316 --> 00:00:42.333
You listen to me.

12
00:00:42.483 --> 00:00:45.000
I just came back from abroad and have wronged you for so many years

13
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.516
Are you and your mother okay?

14
00:00:46.516 --> 00:00:48.350
Where's the liar? I don't have a dad

15
00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:50.316
My mom died early and I'm not a liar

16
00:00:50.316 --> 00:00:51.533
I'm really your dad

17
00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:53.100
I was down and out.

18
00:00:53.483 --> 00:00:55.900
When your mother was pregnant with you

19
00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:58.383
So I had to leave my hometown and start making money.

20
00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:02.100
Later, your grandmother took your mother and left Yuncheng

21
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:03.900
We lost contact.

22
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.016
I only recently learned about your editor in Jiangzhou

23
00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:08.983
Keep editing

24
00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:12.050
Now liars are really changing the story more and more

25
00:01:12.233 --> 00:01:14.300
I don't have time for you to delay and eat immediately

26
00:01:16.916 --> 00:01:18.500
Something happened to Xiaoqing

27
00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:24.883
Little brat, look at it

28
00:01:24.883 --> 00:01:26.600
Look what your mother has become now

29
00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.200
It's all your fault

30
00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.616
What happened?

31
00:01:29.683 --> 00:01:31.816
I don't know.

32
00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:34.750
What about the kid?

33
00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:35.783
See where people are

34
00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:37.250
Who are you looking for?

35
00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:38.900
Cut the crap

36
00:01:38.916 --> 00:01:41.383
You know what your son did

37
00:01:44.116 --> 00:01:46.100
You little rascal!

38
00:01:46.116 --> 00:01:48.483
Just like your dead daddy

39
00:01:48.483 --> 00:01:51.233
Tell me what's wrong with you

40
00:01:51.233 --> 00:01:52.650
I don't have a grandmother.

41
00:01:52.683 --> 00:01:53.683
You misunderstood me.

42
00:01:53.683 --> 00:01:54.816
There must be a reason

43
00:01:55.116 --> 00:01:56.300
They bully Xiaoxue

44
00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:58.650
I beat him up.

45
00:01:59.883 --> 00:02:01.333
This is nonsense.

46
00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.916
You have no ability, what trouble will you cause you?

47
00:02:03.916 --> 00:02:05.783
You want to kill our family

48
00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:07.783
And this is...

49
00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:10.416
A friend of mine.

50
00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:15.350
It's You
