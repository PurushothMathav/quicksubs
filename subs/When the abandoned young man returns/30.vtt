00:00:00.233 --> 00:00:02.766
You can't go to Wanjia with me

2
00:00:02.783 --> 00:00:04.566
Hahahaha

3
00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:06.250
Are you kidding?

4
00:00:06.783 --> 00:00:08.900
I want to go to Wanjia

5
00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:10.233
It has half a dime to do with you.

6
00:00:10.233 --> 00:00:12.966
It's just that you kid can't protect yourself now

7
00:00:13.383 --> 00:00:15.066
And have the face to meddle in other people's business

8
00:00:15.066 --> 00:00:16.233
You are nothing

9
00:00:16.233 --> 00:00:17.400
Why can't I protect myself?

10
00:00:17.466 --> 00:00:18.433
Are you deaf?

11
00:00:18.433 --> 00:00:20.483
Brother Zhen is now hanging out with Master Jie

12
00:00:20.866 --> 00:00:22.283
How dare you provoke Master Jie

13
00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:23.750
I have to skin you

14
00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:25.583
I heard about that.

15
00:00:25.583 --> 00:00:27.666
Master Wan Jie for the wedding

16
00:00:27.666 --> 00:00:30.150
Spent a lot of money to buy the entire hotel

17
00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:31.350
And also

18
00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:34.483
All the big names and surnames of Amami have been invited

19
00:00:34.783 --> 00:00:36.900
When did you have such ability as Master Jie?

20
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:38.266
Are you bragging?

21
00:00:38.266 --> 00:00:40.683
What's the use of such pomp?

22
00:00:40.833 --> 00:00:44.600
I'll tell you how this wedding was robbed today

23
00:00:46.383 --> 00:00:48.700
What? I understand you here.

24
00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:50.400
I just can't see how others are, right?

25
00:00:50.466 --> 00:00:53.033
Hmph, someone else's young master gave me this place

26
00:00:53.033 --> 00:00:54.800
Do you think I can hit you?

27
00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:58.833
The wedding of the young master is about to start

28
00:00:58.833 --> 00:01:00.900
What are you doing here?

29
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:02.633
Police, you're here

30
00:01:02.633 --> 00:01:05.133
Look at this kid making trouble again

31
00:01:05.183 --> 00:01:08.083
He curses your wedding for not being able to go through
