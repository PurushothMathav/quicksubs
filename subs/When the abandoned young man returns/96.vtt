00:00:02.816 --> 00:00:05.033
Master, are you having a nightmare?

2
00:00:06.733 --> 00:00:07.550
no.

3
00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:09.716
What's going on here?

4
00:00:09.816 --> 00:00:11.966
Master, you just had surgery

5
00:00:11.966 --> 00:00:13.466
Just passed the dangerous period

6
00:00:13.483 --> 00:00:14.516
It's all my fault

7
00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:16.150
Don't Blame You

8
00:00:17.133 --> 00:00:18.716
I did it myself.

9
00:00:24.883 --> 00:00:27.750
Master, I have listened to Teacher Chu

10
00:00:28.133 --> 00:00:30.950
I heard today is your birthday

11
00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:32.383
How do you know?

12
00:00:32.416 --> 00:00:35.116
Because I have a bottom I want to send you.

13
00:00:37.133 --> 00:00:38.233
Master Wan

14
00:00:38.366 --> 00:00:40.566
I came to see you specially. Are you alright?

15
00:00:40.566 --> 00:00:41.666
I'm much better.

16
00:00:42.483 --> 00:00:43.616
Can I help you?

17
00:00:43.616 --> 00:00:44.733
It's the following.

18
00:00:44.733 --> 00:00:47.216
This time we went through life and death together

19
00:00:47.216 --> 00:00:48.733
Make me feel precious

20
00:00:48.733 --> 00:00:51.550
I think if possible we

21
00:00:52.016 --> 00:00:53.766
Miss Xia, I know what you mean.

22
00:00:53.766 --> 00:00:54.716
But

23
00:00:55.366 --> 00:00:56.883
Emotional things can't be forced

24
00:00:56.883 --> 00:00:57.833
and

25
00:00:58.416 --> 00:00:59.783
During the coma

26
00:00:59.816 --> 00:01:01.266
I remember a lot of things

27
00:01:01.683 --> 00:01:02.916
Someone else is waiting for me

28
00:01:02.966 --> 00:01:04.033
What do you mean?

29
00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:05.583
Don't worry about that.

30
00:01:06.483 --> 00:01:07.633
The capital chain under its jurisdiction is broken

31
00:01:07.933 --> 00:01:08.833
I see.

32
00:01:08.966 --> 00:01:11.583
I have asked this matter to be arranged.

33
00:01:11.766 --> 00:01:14.033
5 billion funds will arrive soon

34
00:01:14.166 --> 00:01:16.216
Really? Of course it's true.

35
00:01:16.216 --> 00:01:19.550
After all, you saved my 5 billion

36
00:01:20.333 --> 00:01:22.383
We kissed, right?

37
00:01:22.483 --> 00:01:24.650
You just said you had a gift for me

38
00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:26.033
Uh sir

39
00:01:26.133 --> 00:01:28.666
I just remembered that I forgot my present.

40
00:01:28.966 --> 00:01:30.183
I'm really sorry.

41
00:01:39.283 --> 00:01:42.066
Young Master, I don't know the sky and earth

42
00:01:42.683 --> 00:01:44.883
That watch can be treasured for you until now

43
00:01:44.883 --> 00:01:47.833
The person who gave you the gift must be very important to you.

44
00:01:48.133 --> 00:01:50.266
Even relatives like Miss Xia

45
00:01:50.616 --> 00:01:52.350
Can't get into your heart

46
00:01:54.333 --> 00:01:55.633
Yang Jing, Yang Jing

47
00:01:55.883 --> 00:01:57.466
Don't have those anymore

48
00:01:57.933 --> 00:01:59.550
Unrealistic fantasy
