1
00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:02.483
Yang Xing as secretary general

2
00:00:02.666 --> 00:00:05.566
Confidential documents with our company are also embarrassing

3
00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:06.566
No, no, no.

4
00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:11.816
This is all the president's personal responsibility

5
00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:14.566
No one else can interfere

6
00:00:14.783 --> 00:00:17.866
什么少爷我我不知道啊

7
00:00:17.866 --> 00:00:19.733
这这不关我事啊

8
00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:21.416
Then this river restarts

9
00:00:21.866 --> 00:00:22.783
What do you mean?

10
00:00:22.783 --> 00:00:24.033
If I'm right

11
00:00:24.033 --> 00:00:27.483
Jianghe refers to Jianghe Chamber of Commerce

12
00:00:27.516 --> 00:00:30.550
What is Jianghe Chamber of Commerce?

13
00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:32.416
It is also a world-class consortium

14
00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:34.583
Old enemy with us

15
00:00:34.583 --> 00:00:37.516
In the process of doing business with us?

16
00:00:37.516 --> 00:00:38.950
Has collapsed

17
00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:41.450
It no longer exists.

18
00:00:41.783 --> 00:00:42.683
Secretary Yang

19
00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:45.533
You can't be undercover, can you?

20
00:00:45.716 --> 00:00:46.783
No sir

21
00:00:46.783 --> 00:00:48.683
You believe me it's not like that

22
00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.166
As far as I know

23
00:00:50.233 --> 00:00:52.716
Secretary Yang at the celebrity convention

24
00:00:52.716 --> 00:00:56.766
Specifically nominated the Cao family father and son to cooperate with us

25
00:00:56.783 --> 00:00:59.750
And the Cao father and son also corrected

26
00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:01.683
Said it was at your command

27
00:01:01.866 --> 00:01:04.633
You have to admit that.

28
00:01:04.633 --> 00:01:06.033
Celebrity convention

29
00:01:06.033 --> 00:01:07.666
I didn't have any selfishness involved.

30
00:01:07.666 --> 00:01:09.233
I'm all about the bigger picture

31
00:01:09.233 --> 00:01:11.183
Master, please believe me.

32
00:01:11.183 --> 00:01:13.450
Then why did I still hear

33
00:01:14.066 --> 00:01:17.116
The public relations manager who opposed the young master

34
00:01:17.116 --> 00:01:19.066
Did you promote it?

35
00:01:19.066 --> 00:01:21.166
The wind is weak, what do you mean?

36
00:01:21.233 --> 00:01:22.650
You deliberately framed me

37
00:01:22.666 --> 00:01:26.483
Young Master, this time it's not easy

38
00:01:26.633 --> 00:01:28.650
Must be strictly checked

39
00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.333
Otherwise, the consequences will be unimaginable

40
00:01:34.233 --> 00:01:35.616
It seems that this is the only way

41
00:01:38.266 --> 00:01:41.483
Then I feel wronged by Secretary Yang

42
00:01:41.716 --> 00:01:46.083
Come and arrest Secretary Yang for me first, young master
