00:00:00.183 --> 00:00:01.450
Don't go too far.

2
00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:03.633
What's wrong with me?

3
00:00:03.633 --> 00:00:05.783
You stinky security guard dare to fight me

4
00:00:05.783 --> 00:00:06.983
I gave you face, right?

5
00:00:06.983 --> 00:00:08.983
Did Manager Liu hear that?

6
00:00:08.983 --> 00:00:10.450
Just do as the young lady said

7
00:00:10.516 --> 00:00:11.316
hands-on

8
00:00:12.316 --> 00:00:17.466
Hahahahahahaha oops

9
00:00:17.466 --> 00:00:18.483
Okay.

10
00:00:18.516 --> 00:00:21.683
Let him go, sir, I don't want to see him again

11
00:00:22.383 --> 00:00:23.833
Hey what's the matter

12
00:00:23.833 --> 00:00:25.416
What's your situation?

13
00:00:26.033 --> 00:00:27.633
Get the hell out of here

14
00:00:27.633 --> 00:00:29.783
If I don't see you, I'll hit you once.

15
00:00:29.783 --> 00:00:32.783
This kid is full of shit

16
00:00:32.783 --> 00:00:33.750
Not necessarily good

17
00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.350
Who let him offend Wan Shao?

18
00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:37.450
Wanjia is the richest man in Beijing

19
00:00:37.583 --> 00:00:39.233
I really don't know how high the sky is

20
00:00:39.233 --> 00:00:41.283
Will I be in tune?

21
00:00:41.316 --> 00:00:42.116
Come come come

22
00:00:45.833 --> 00:00:47.016
Don't run

23
00:00:53.716 --> 00:00:55.566
Hey, this society

24
00:00:56.383 --> 00:00:57.950
Just be so damn realistic

25
00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:58.966
No money

26
00:00:59.516 --> 00:01:01.016
Just being bullied

27
00:01:04.066 --> 00:01:04.866
Hey

28
00:01:13.866 --> 00:01:14.883
Don't be nervous.

29
00:01:15.183 --> 00:01:16.450
Who are you?

30
00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:18.016
This is my life.

31
