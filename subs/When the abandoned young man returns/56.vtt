00:00:00.466 --> 00:00:02.133
Today's million merchants conference

2
00:00:02.583 --> 00:00:03.966
Just for me

3
00:00:04.433 --> 00:00:06.166
Hahahaha oh

4
00:00:06.783 --> 00:00:10.650
Wan Jiaqi, why are you still talking like a fart?

5
00:00:10.666 --> 00:00:14.933
You just happen to be surnamed Wan, not from the Wan family at all

6
00:00:15.033 --> 00:00:15.750
Believe it or not?

7
00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.550
You really think we are fools, Wan Jiaqi

8
00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:19.583
Just an orphan

9
00:00:19.583 --> 00:00:21.333
You want to climb all the branches

10
00:00:21.783 --> 00:00:23.533
Everyone in the family has peeled your skin off

11
00:00:23.833 --> 00:00:25.166
Yes, Mr Wang.

12
00:00:25.233 --> 00:00:26.733
It's called enlightenment.

13
00:00:26.983 --> 00:00:28.750
Didn't Chen Zhixiong tell you anything?

14
00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:30.600
We never ask about Master Xiong

15
00:00:31.033 --> 00:00:32.933
Then I say I am the eldest young master of Wanjia

16
00:00:33.033 --> 00:00:34.250
Do you believe it?

17
00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.083
Haha Wan Jiaqi

18
00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.033
You see, you don't believe anyone.

19
00:00:39.033 --> 00:00:41.450
You also say that you are the eldest young master of Wan Family

20
00:00:41.466 --> 00:00:43.433
If it's really the young master of the Wanjia

21
00:00:43.433 --> 00:00:46.183
Then why doesn't Master Wanjie know you?

22
00:00:46.183 --> 00:00:47.850
Yes, that's right.

23
00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:49.850
Last time you were so noisy at the wedding

24
00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.250
Master Wanjie hasn't settled the bill with you yet

25
00:00:52.266 --> 00:00:53.900
Wait a minute, Master Wanjie is here

26
00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:55.283
See how you argue with him

27
00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.166
This is banquet farming

28
00:00:57.266 --> 00:00:58.566
Who dares to make trouble?
