00:00:04.066 --> 00:00:06.000
How could he die?

2
00:00:07.766 --> 00:00:09.033
Are you all right?

3
00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:12.066
Where he died

4
00:00:12.333 --> 00:00:14.866
Exactly where we hit him

5
00:00:15.066 --> 00:00:18.233
Do you think he is because of me?

6
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.466
It's okay, don't give it to me.

7
00:00:20.466 --> 00:00:22.000
Someone wiped his neck.

8
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.033
What's your business?

9
00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:31.033
It's been robbed.

10
00:00:32.166 --> 00:00:33.200
Who is so bold

11
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.000
Dare to run to the Protector's Mansion to steal things

12
00:00:35.333 --> 00:00:38.266
We just finished asking about Xuanmingyue Linglong Sword

13
00:00:38.266 --> 00:00:39.500
He was silenced

14
00:00:40.333 --> 00:00:42.766
Now the Protector's Mansion has been stolen again

15
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.600
This must have something to do with Linglong Sword

16
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.266
Isn't the exquisite sword a secret recipe?

17
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.700
Maybe Xuan Mingyu lied

18
00:00:52.466 --> 00:00:54.333
Where did you hide him last time you passed out?

19
00:00:54.333 --> 00:00:55.533
I've never seen that thing before.

20
00:00:55.533 --> 00:00:56.866
Isn't it with you?

21
00:00:56.866 --> 00:00:58.833
No, where is that?
