1
00:00:01.933 --> 00:00:03.100
Just got the news.

2
00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:05.766
Baidang Guanliang transported from Qingzhou to Beijing

3
00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:06.900
sudden disappearance

4
00:00:06.933 --> 00:00:08.666
Xiaojiu, the weather is so good

5
00:00:08.666 --> 00:00:10.000
Let's go fly a kite.

6
00:00:12.866 --> 00:00:14.266
You are talking

7
00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:15.666
Then I'll come later.

8
00:00:15.666 --> 00:00:17.833
It's okay, you can listen to it together.

9
00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:19.600
These things in the future

10
00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.300
It will be slowly handed over to you to deal with.

11
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.933
No, no, no. I'm just an embroidered pillow

12
00:00:23.933 --> 00:00:25.166
useless

13
00:00:25.166 --> 00:00:26.066
You continue

14
00:00:27.933 --> 00:00:28.966
Qinzhou

15
00:00:29.666 --> 00:00:33.533
I remember that Chunyu's older brother is the governor of Qinzhou

16
00:00:33.533 --> 00:00:36.166
And your uncle Li Shangshu's subordinates

17
00:00:36.166 --> 00:00:38.166
Recent grain traders from other countries

18
00:00:38.333 --> 00:00:39.566
Frequent contact

19
00:00:39.866 --> 00:00:42.600
The Chunyu family depends on the emperor

20
00:00:42.733 --> 00:00:44.766
And everywhere against the Feng family

21
00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:48.400
My sister finally couldn't help herself.

22
00:00:48.466 --> 00:00:50.666
Start eradicating everything

23
00:00:51.966 --> 00:00:53.400
Sure enough

24
00:00:53.533 --> 00:00:55.966
It turns out that Feng Qingya and Nangong are really a good match

25
00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.600
And I'm like an outsider

26
00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.033
No, I was an outsider

27
00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.666
Maybe I shouldn't have taken these bodies

28
00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:05.833
Sister Chen Ya

29
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:07.866
Sister Chen Ya?

30
00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:08.933
What are you dazed about?

31
00:01:08.933 --> 00:01:10.500
How many times have I called you?

32
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.766
Xiao Jiu, I was thinking

33
00:01:12.766 --> 00:01:14.533
Should we find a charlatan?

34
00:01:14.533 --> 00:01:16.400
We can't exchange our bodies back.
