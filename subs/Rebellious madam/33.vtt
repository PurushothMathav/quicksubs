00:00:02.333 --> 00:00:04.066
Why did I start to care about him?

2
00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:08.966
Help! What a luxury

3
00:00:08.966 --> 00:00:10.333
Is the emperor a cat?

4
00:00:10.333 --> 00:00:11.833
Why is it okay to walk?

5
00:00:12.566 --> 00:00:14.866
The Sark Message Challenge is temporarily over

6
00:00:15.966 --> 00:00:18.000
Go back if you want, okay?

7
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:18.766
Thank you emperor

8
00:00:18.766 --> 00:00:19.700
Then I'm leaving.

9
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.066
If you have nothing to do, you can enter the palace more and move around.

10
00:00:22.166 --> 00:00:24.100
Your sister misses you very much

11
00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:30.366
Queen little ghost letter

12
00:00:30.966 --> 00:00:32.266
This man is not easy to mess with

13
00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:33.966
It's better not to get too close to him

14
00:00:36.933 --> 00:00:39.433
I know you hate being the wife of the country

15
00:00:39.566 --> 00:00:41.233
I've been trying to find a way to escape

16
00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.600
Oops, you've found it all, but I think

17
00:00:44.766 --> 00:00:46.066
You can do me well

18
00:00:46.066 --> 00:00:48.600
You are a better fit for this position than me

19
00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.400
When my boss told me to work hard

20
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.166
That's how you draw my cakes

21
00:00:55.766 --> 00:00:58.966
Alright, I will try my best to do a good job of Fengqing

22
00:00:58.966 --> 00:01:01.100
After all, are we friends now?

23
00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:01.900
OK

24
00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.433
Since you said so

25
00:01:05.133 --> 00:01:08.000
Then I will reluctantly recognize you as a friend

26
00:01:08.566 --> 00:01:11.566
Children, don't let the boss scold and laugh

27
00:01:12.766 --> 00:01:13.900
He's back.

28
00:01:15.566 --> 00:01:16.466
He's back.

29
00:01:19.366 --> 00:01:20.800
Ah dead man
