1
00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:04.400
On my medicine

2
00:00:05.333 --> 00:00:07.366
Do you have ammo?

3
00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:09.300
Oh, let me look for it.

4
00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:24.833
You are the emperor

5
00:00:24.933 --> 00:00:25.333
around

6
00:00:25.333 --> 00:00:27.800
Shouldn't you bring 180 martial arts guards every day?

7
00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.500
I have raised so many people

8
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.500
Only you saved me

9
00:00:36.166 --> 00:00:37.000
Go ahead.

10
00:00:38.333 --> 00:00:39.966
What do you want from me?

11
00:00:40.866 --> 00:00:42.566
I promise you

12
00:00:43.866 --> 00:00:44.866
I want to go home.

13
00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.700
Are you so unwilling to be with me?

14
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.366
In the heart of the emperor

15
00:00:53.366 --> 00:00:55.766
There must be something more important than elegance

16
00:00:56.266 --> 00:00:58.366
I said I had to choose one of the two

17
00:00:59.133 --> 00:01:02.100
I don't want to be the one who is given up

18
00:01:08.666 --> 00:01:09.866
That's all.

19
00:01:10.933 --> 00:01:11.966
It is useless to force

20
00:01:14.733 --> 00:01:16.000
There you go.

21
00:01:20.866 --> 00:01:21.866
Madam is not well

22
00:01:21.866 --> 00:01:22.833
Can't go

23
00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:23.733
Our car out of the palace

24
00:01:23.733 --> 00:01:25.433
Immediately it was thrown full of rotten vegetable leaves

25
00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.166
The people around said

26
00:01:27.266 --> 00:01:28.166
You broke up

27
00:01:28.166 --> 00:01:30.866
The marriage between Pure Foolish Duke and Princess Leng

28
00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:32.300
The leaves are so fresh

29
00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:34.966
If you pull it back, you can still feed the chickens.

30
00:01:35.766 --> 00:01:36.666
Thank you

31
00:01:36.666 --> 00:01:38.200
Go back and give you a raise

32
00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.000
The second step in wage crisis public relations

33
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.600
What should I do if I find a way back?
