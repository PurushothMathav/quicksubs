00:00:01.666 --> 00:00:03.366
You can go take a look there.

2
00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:07.266
Perhaps it will help you recover your memory.

3
00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:11.566
Go to Shuge and read some books.

4
00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:13.300
Shuge again?

5
00:00:14.166 --> 00:00:15.700
Hmm.

6
00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:18.066
Actually, I feel quite content now.

7
00:00:18.066 --> 00:00:19.766
Didn't Sister say I'm happier now?

8
00:00:19.766 --> 00:00:20.166
Well then,

9
00:00:20.166 --> 00:00:22.133
Wasn't the past not unhappy memories either?

10
00:00:22.133 --> 00:00:22.933
Qingyang.

11
00:00:24.533 --> 00:00:26.966
I advise you not to test my patience.

12
00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:30.600
I just don't want to revert to my old self.

13
00:00:33.666 --> 00:00:37.300
Do you even remember him?

14
00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.666
I advise you to remember as soon as possible.

15
00:00:44.366 --> 00:00:47.000
So that he doesn't come to harm.

16
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.200
You'll regret it once you regain your memory.

17
00:00:56.333 --> 00:00:57.700
If he gets exposed,

18
00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:59.300
Mingyu will be in danger.

19
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.100
Hey.

20
00:01:01.933 --> 00:01:03.433
What did the Empress ask you?

21
00:01:04.066 --> 00:01:05.100
Who is Mingyu?

22
00:01:05.133 --> 00:01:06.600
He's using that to threaten me.
