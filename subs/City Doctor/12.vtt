1
00:00:00.083 --> 00:00:02.400
The one with the cigar is called Sun Zhifei

2
00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:04.450
It is the second largest shareholder of my Blue Cloud Group

3
00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:05.283
Son of Sun Kuo

4
00:00:05.283 --> 00:00:06.666
He's here.

5
00:00:06.733 --> 00:00:09.100
Presumably to compete with me for Blue Cloud Group

6
00:00:09.166 --> 00:00:11.283
The bad guy, as for the other one

7
00:00:11.283 --> 00:00:12.700
I don't know him.

8
00:00:13.483 --> 00:00:14.366
Sun Zhifei

9
00:00:14.366 --> 00:00:16.833
Tell your men to behave and not be so arrogant

10
00:00:19.966 --> 00:00:20.866
You say he

11
00:00:21.566 --> 00:00:23.166
This is not one of my men

12
00:00:23.166 --> 00:00:26.033
He was specially invited by me to guide us

13
00:00:26.566 --> 00:00:27.366
see a doctor

14
00:00:28.683 --> 00:00:31.533
Zhou Jin, he is at Manchester West University

15
00:00:31.533 --> 00:00:33.250
I have a Ph.D.

16
00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:36.183
Back in the city's tier 1 hospital

17
00:00:37.483 --> 00:00:38.933
He's still in that lancet

18
00:00:38.933 --> 00:00:41.283
Oh, yeah. The Lancet.

19
00:00:41.283 --> 00:00:44.083
The most important thing is

20
00:00:44.083 --> 00:00:47.350
Hada 11 should be spring breeze

21
00:00:48.683 --> 00:00:50.600
What? I said what?

22
00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:51.883
It's a turtle

23
00:00:51.883 --> 00:00:53.200
If you don't explain it clearly

24
00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.300
Who knows what kind of game to play?

25
00:00:56.083 --> 00:00:58.233
Master, what is your dog talking about?

26
00:00:58.333 --> 00:01:00.000
Get lost Sun Zhiwei, shut up for me

27
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.266
This is the doctor I hired for Yingdong

28
00:01:02.533 --> 00:01:04.666
Hahahaha, he can also heal

29
00:01:04.966 --> 00:01:06.150
An open road

30
00:01:06.283 --> 00:01:09.183
Lu Zhaoyuan, are you okay with your brain?

31
00:01:11.133 --> 00:01:11.933
Ah!

32
00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:14.000
There is a problem with the phone.

33
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.433
Hurry up, go out and treat him, hahaha.

34
00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.650
You said you would see a doctor too

35
00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:20.766
If you can see a doctor

36
00:01:20.766 --> 00:01:23.650
I'll chop my head off for you

37
00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:25.233
Is the sphere good?

38
00:01:26.133 --> 00:01:27.166
Come, come, come

39
00:01:27.166 --> 00:01:28.966
Dogs have the courage to learn to see a doctor

40
00:01:28.966 --> 00:01:30.900
Which eye did you graduate from university?

41
00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:32.850
You are sick, you are fucking sick

42
00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:33.766
You every morning

43
00:01:33.766 --> 00:01:35.600
You'll have a dull pain in your lower left abdomen

44
00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.083
But after an hour, the pain will go away

45
00:01:38.083 --> 00:01:38.883
Am I right?

46
00:01:38.883 --> 00:01:41.066
What nonsense are you talking about? It can't be three days.

47
00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:43.850
After 3 days

48
00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:46.333
The pain in your lower left abdomen will explode completely

49
00:01:46.333 --> 00:01:49.550
By then, even the gods can't cure your disease
