00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:03.083
Hey down to earth

2
00:00:03.083 --> 00:00:05.450
I packed your favorite preserved egg and lean meat porridge

3
00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:07.733
Go to sleep when you're done eating

4
00:00:07.733 --> 00:00:10.150
Thank you, Uncle Chen, eat

5
00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:21.283
Uncle Chen, if you hadn't taken care of me these years

6
00:00:21.283 --> 00:00:23.183
I don't know what it's going to be like yet

7
00:00:23.566 --> 00:00:25.566
What did you say to me?

8
00:00:25.566 --> 00:00:26.883
Hey, are you going missing?

9
00:00:26.883 --> 00:00:28.800
Old post, I don't know where you went

10
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:29.883
Come back at this point.

11
00:00:29.883 --> 00:00:31.033
Something urgent

12
00:00:31.533 --> 00:00:33.866
Forget it, let's talk about it

13
00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.533
Okay, okay, you have a lot to do

14
00:00:36.533 --> 00:00:37.283
Come come

15
00:00:37.283 --> 00:00:39.483
Hurry up and pay this month's living expenses

16
00:00:39.483 --> 00:00:41.966
What are you doing? Living expenses

17
00:00:41.966 --> 00:00:44.000
This firewood, rice, oil and salt are free.

18
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.333
He's such a big man

19
00:00:45.333 --> 00:00:47.350
And let him eat for free all day long

20
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.083
Can you say a few words less?

21
00:00:50.083 --> 00:00:52.633
There are arguments and vegetables, but you can't keep your mouth shut.

22
00:00:55.366 --> 00:00:57.066
Xiaofan is fine Xiao Zhou

23
00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:58.650
Why don't you eat it?

24
00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:00.250
It's not like your usual style.

25
00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:02.850
Eating in the early morning is as clean as a dog licking

26
00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:03.650
Yes, Xiaofan

27
00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:06.350
Is this porridge not appetizing? This porridge

28
00:01:08.533 --> 00:01:10.066
Would you drink it?
