00:00:00.566 --> 00:00:03.266
If you can't beat it, you dare to say a sneak attack

2
00:00:03.283 --> 00:00:06.383
My mother's grandson is not that bastard who dares to lie to me

3
00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:09.133
And you're playing pig and eating tiger here

4
00:00:09.133 --> 00:00:10.750
Now that you know

5
00:00:11.766 --> 00:00:13.150
Then I don't have to pretend

6
00:00:13.333 --> 00:00:15.600
How dare you act here

7
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.083
Are you fucking stupid?

8
00:00:17.083 --> 00:00:19.933
This is my home.

9
00:00:19.933 --> 00:00:22.566
A place to escape from home and be buried

10
00:00:22.566 --> 00:00:23.633
You idiot

11
00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:24.366
Do you believe it or not?

12
00:00:24.366 --> 00:00:26.933
No matter how I clean you up, no one will help you

13
00:00:26.933 --> 00:00:28.033
Don't you dare

14
00:00:30.283 --> 00:00:32.100
How dare you hit me?

15
00:00:33.533 --> 00:00:35.783
I think that most of them don't dare to hit me

16
00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:40.666
Bastard let me go

17
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:43.750
Grandpa dad

18
00:00:43.933 --> 00:00:46.000
Bastard, don't come here again

19
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.283
Let go of me

20
00:00:47.283 --> 00:00:48.600
Are they two escorts?

21
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.650
Accompanying you to death is a slap in the face

22
00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:52.000
The more I look for the prince now

23
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.500
The more embarrassed you are to die, let me go

24
00:00:55.933 --> 00:00:56.733
Grandpa

25
00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:58.433
grandfather

26
00:00:58.483 --> 00:01:01.266
Let your guards shoot this bastard
