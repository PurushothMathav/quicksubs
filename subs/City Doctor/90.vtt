00:00:00.283 --> 00:00:01.533
Truman's World?

2
00:00:01.533 --> 00:00:03.600
It turns out that I have lived in someone else's life

3
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.033
In a woven story

4
00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:07.400
I see you've lost the will to resist

5
00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.550
It's exactly the same as before

6
00:00:09.766 --> 00:00:13.300
Even if it's you from the academy

7
00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:15.550
You still can't support the wall

8
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.666
Then who say no?

9
00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:20.933
I've already been defeated once

10
00:00:20.933 --> 00:00:22.400
The injury is not healed

11
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.183
I'm going to pick up girls right away

12
00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:25.950
I really know everything

13
00:00:25.966 --> 00:00:27.033
It seems

14
00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:29.350
Hurt my east someone

15
00:00:30.166 --> 00:00:31.266
It's a god schoolbag.

16
00:00:34.966 --> 00:00:36.300
How do you know that?

17
00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:37.900
It's time for candy

18
00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.400
White Rabbit Toffee

19
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.350
Hmm, Master Shan

20
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:45.983
OK

21
00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.383
Just a white rabbit toffee

22
00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.866
It's because of your doubts about me

23
00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:02.050
Don't you always say I look like a fool?

24
00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:05.750
Fools are short of money, aren't they?

25
00:01:07.166 --> 00:01:07.983
So

26
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:09.950
Who are you?

27
00:01:15.133 --> 00:01:16.483
When you hit me

28
00:01:16.483 --> 00:01:18.083
It smells like white rabbit toffee

29
00:01:18.083 --> 00:01:19.550
When you leave

30
00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:23.100
It's also a white rabbit toffee in your mouth, right?

31
00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.266
That's it. There's more.
