1
00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:01.383
You can refine medicine

2
00:00:01.933 --> 00:00:02.866
Sorry. Sorry.

3
00:00:03.566 --> 00:00:05.583
It's okay, you're not that loud.

4
00:00:05.966 --> 00:00:07.983
The sound is pretty nice

5
00:00:08.166 --> 00:00:10.350
In fact, refining medicine

6
00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:11.800
I still understand a little bit

7
00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:13.400
Do you think I'm gullible?

8
00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.200
Or are you kidding me?

9
00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:16.600
In our Jiangcheng

10
00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.366
Only chat with a few pharmacists

11
00:00:18.366 --> 00:00:20.966
And each is the first to be honored

12
00:00:20.966 --> 00:00:23.100
Like the pharmacist Luo I asked for today

13
00:00:23.133 --> 00:00:24.666
Fukanishi Maru made by him

14
00:00:24.683 --> 00:00:27.150
The starting price is 500,000

15
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:30.333
This is just a quarrel, but 1 million

16
00:00:30.333 --> 00:00:32.966
Pharmacists are a branch of the traditional Chinese medicine system

17
00:00:32.966 --> 00:00:35.533
It's just that the conditions for becoming a pharmacist are extremely harsh

18
00:00:35.533 --> 00:00:37.983
I have no problem refining pills if I have inheritance.

19
00:00:38.083 --> 00:00:39.450
Let alone refining medicine

20
00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.633
In the future, I may be able to make money by refining pills

21
00:00:43.566 --> 00:00:44.700
Then you are here today

22
00:00:44.733 --> 00:00:46.766
Is it to ask Medicine Master Luo for medicine?

23
00:00:46.766 --> 00:00:47.933
My grandfather has a strange disease

24
00:00:47.933 --> 00:00:49.850
I saw a lot of doctors and couldn't cure it.

25
00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:52.583
I heard that this western pill has a strange effect

26
00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:55.633
So I want to ask for a lesson in strange diseases

27
00:00:56.166 --> 00:00:57.833
Actually I can too
