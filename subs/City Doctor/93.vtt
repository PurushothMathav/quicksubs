00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:01.566
Don't you want revenge?

2
00:00:01.566 --> 00:00:05.066
Yes, but do I have the ability to take revenge?

3
00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:06.400
If I had

4
00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:07.966
I still need to talk to you here.

5
00:00:07.966 --> 00:00:09.350
We talked so much

6
00:00:09.533 --> 00:00:11.950
So you didn't drink that bowl of porridge just now.

7
00:00:12.166 --> 00:00:15.233
I just feel like I have the strength to showdown

8
00:00:15.366 --> 00:00:17.033
It's not because of this bowl of porridge

9
00:00:17.683 --> 00:00:19.983
Drink it before

10
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Then why don't you drink it now?

11
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.066
Previous porridge

12
00:00:23.566 --> 00:00:24.483
It's not poisonous.

13
00:00:24.483 --> 00:00:26.733
Since any choice is dead

14
00:00:26.733 --> 00:00:29.466
Why don't I fight back and hum aggressively

15
00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:31.033
But you're right.

16
00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.550
Then you are waiting to die now.

17
00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.383
Don't you want to save?

18
00:00:41.483 --> 00:00:44.600
My dad is talking to you, but he wants to turn the sky upside down

19
00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.533
I don't know how to write shit, right?

20
00:00:46.533 --> 00:00:48.683
If you have any questions, just ask them together.

21
00:00:48.683 --> 00:00:51.266
Don't let you do an understanding after you die

22
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.733
Do you know why I went to Cattle and Sheep to play hard?

23
00:00:54.733 --> 00:00:58.133
That's not to use this explosive power to defeat Qianqian

24
00:00:58.133 --> 00:00:59.966
A way to live for yourself

25
00:00:59.966 --> 00:01:01.266
Then look at me

26
00:01:01.683 --> 00:01:02.866
Did it explode?

27
00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:04.983
Let's die together

28
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.183
OK.

29
00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:11.850
Enter the city and surrender

30
00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.566
In this extreme situation

31
00:01:13.566 --> 00:01:15.483
To think of such a way to escape

32
00:01:15.483 --> 00:01:16.750
It seems that this fire

33
00:01:16.966 --> 00:01:18.983
He's not a total loser.
