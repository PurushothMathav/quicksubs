00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.233
He looks like a dead dog!

2
00:00:11.566 --> 00:00:12.533
I didn't see anything.

3
00:00:12.533 --> 00:00:13.366
I didn't see anything.

4
00:00:13.366 --> 00:00:14.650
I don't know. You didn't see anything

5
00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:15.850
I shouldn't have saved you

6
00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:16.566
It's all right now.

7
00:00:16.566 --> 00:00:17.450
You've seen everything

8
00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:18.650
How do you say it should be solved?

9
00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:19.600
What? How?

10
00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:20.650
What do you say?

11
00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:21.733
I can't finish reading you

12
00:00:21.733 --> 00:00:23.083
I can't be responsible to you to the end, right?

13
00:00:23.083 --> 00:00:25.733
Go to hell, didn't you ask me how to solve it?

14
00:00:25.733 --> 00:00:27.250
Stop talking about this mess

15
00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:29.150
I'm asking you what to do about Asatsuki

16
00:00:29.366 --> 00:00:31.566
What do you mean?

17
00:00:31.566 --> 00:00:33.633
Did you say anything to Sister Yue?

18
00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:36.083
If only I could tell him what to do

19
00:00:36.083 --> 00:00:36.950
How come?

20
00:00:37.083 --> 00:00:37.850
What did Zhao Yue say?

21
00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:39.033
I can't get in touch with him.

22
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:41.366
How come?

23
00:00:41.366 --> 00:00:43.166
If all you can do is yell

24
00:00:43.166 --> 00:00:44.300
You can go now.

25
00:00:46.766 --> 00:00:47.566
Sorry.

26
00:00:48.083 --> 00:00:49.100
Can communicate

27
00:00:50.083 --> 00:00:52.133
Okay, did you provoke someone?

28
00:00:52.133 --> 00:00:54.233
Or do you have any enemies?

29
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:55.400
Yes.

30
00:00:55.966 --> 00:00:57.100
That's right.

31
00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:58.466
How come?
