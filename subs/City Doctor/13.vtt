00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:02.800
Three days, why don't you say three months?

2
00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:03.800
You are kidding

3
00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:05.133
No, I'm a medical PhD.

4
00:00:05.133 --> 00:00:06.333
I can't even see the problem

5
00:00:06.333 --> 00:00:08.250
You're a watchdog, you can tell

6
00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.683
I'm afraid you're not trying to surprise my buck teeth, are you?

7
00:00:10.683 --> 00:00:11.500
kid

8
00:00:12.166 --> 00:00:14.150
I really thought I, Sun Zhifei, was bluffing

9
00:00:14.483 --> 00:00:16.666
Who are you scaring with this?

10
00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:18.200
Lin Zhaoyuan

11
00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.633
Get this watchdog away from me now

12
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:22.333
How embarrassing

13
00:00:22.333 --> 00:00:23.400
None of your business.

14
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.400
Mr. Du, he offended us, but it's nothing

15
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.250
But he is going to offend Yin Dong

16
00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:30.700
The Blue Rock Group joke?

17
00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:33.683
The lord is awake

18
00:00:33.683 --> 00:00:35.700
Guest please come in

19
00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:41.200
The identity of that kid is obviously wrong

20
00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:42.466
For a consideration

21
00:00:42.483 --> 00:00:44.700
I don't think we should let him in

22
00:00:44.966 --> 00:00:46.550
Dirty you for him again

23
00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.100
Sun Zhifei, shut up for me

24
00:00:49.166 --> 00:00:52.100
Oh, hahahaha.

25
00:00:52.766 --> 00:00:55.233
Hello, I'm Lu Zhaoyue, president of Blue Cloud Group.

26
00:00:55.366 --> 00:00:56.550
This is Xiao Fan.

27
00:00:57.483 --> 00:00:58.850
Although it's just my company's security guard

28
00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:00.683
But his medical skills were brilliant.

29
00:01:00.683 --> 00:01:02.450
I specially hired to treat the leader

30
00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:04.600
What kind of disease can a security guard treat me?

31
00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.650
Can you take responsibility if something goes wrong?

32
00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:07.633
I can afford it.

33
00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.600
You can afford it.

34
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.266
Remember what you said and go

35
00:01:15.533 --> 00:01:17.450
How is the third master

36
00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:20.500
Let's all go in and wait for the result
