1
00:00:00.733 --> 00:00:01.533
Yeah.

2
00:00:02.766 --> 00:00:03.683
That's not possible.

3
00:00:03.683 --> 00:00:05.633
This is definitely not something I'm angry about

4
00:00:06.283 --> 00:00:08.433
Ah, I see.

5
00:00:09.133 --> 00:00:10.166
What do you know?

6
00:00:10.166 --> 00:00:12.600
This bug is prepared in advance by you

7
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.050
You pretend to treat me

8
00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:15.650
And then you take this out.

9
00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:19.433
Just to convince me if I'm right

10
00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:21.750
Hey what?

11
00:00:21.883 --> 00:00:22.966
Are you speechless?

12
00:00:22.966 --> 00:00:24.733
Mm, you win.

13
00:00:24.733 --> 00:00:27.683
I seem to have something I haven't said just now. What?

14
00:00:27.683 --> 00:00:28.733
Not a big deal

15
00:00:28.733 --> 00:00:31.133
Except for this bug on my hand

16
00:00:31.133 --> 00:00:33.250
There are at least dozens more in your heart

17
00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:34.233
Pardon me?

18
00:00:34.333 --> 00:00:35.400
Would I lie to you?

19
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.733
Xiaofan, I apologize to you for Zicheng

20
00:00:37.733 --> 00:00:39.133
Is what you said true?

21
00:00:39.133 --> 00:00:40.083
Nature is real

22
00:00:40.083 --> 00:00:42.133
Because it is inconvenient to observe him directly with your eyes

23
00:00:42.133 --> 00:00:43.083
So I mistakenly thought

24
00:00:43.083 --> 00:00:44.683
There is only one bug in his body

25
00:00:44.683 --> 00:00:46.766
But when I took this worm out

26
00:00:46.766 --> 00:00:49.466
But woke up the other bugs in his body and

27
00:00:49.533 --> 00:00:50.333
And what?

28
00:00:50.333 --> 00:00:51.900
This should be ancient, no doubt

29
00:00:51.966 --> 00:00:54.133
What is Gu Chao?

30
00:00:54.133 --> 00:00:56.483
An artificially bred venomous insect

31
00:00:56.483 --> 00:00:58.733
It is to transfer dozens of powerful poisonous insects

32
00:00:58.733 --> 00:01:00.133
In a secret melting pot

33
00:01:00.133 --> 00:01:01.533
Let them shovel each other's shit

34
00:01:01.533 --> 00:01:02.933
The last one who survived

35
00:01:02.933 --> 00:01:04.650
Jane called it enough.

36
00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:05.750
Stop talking nonsense

37
00:01:06.133 --> 00:01:07.533
Zhao Yue, you go out first

38
00:01:07.533 --> 00:01:08.750
See how I teach him a lesson

39
00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:11.100
What's your situation?

40
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.300
Dad save me
