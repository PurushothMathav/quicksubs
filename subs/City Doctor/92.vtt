00:00:00.083 --> 00:00:01.900
So Lin Kexin

2
00:00:02.733 --> 00:00:04.166
It was also arranged by you.

3
00:00:04.166 --> 00:00:06.083
Yes, I understand.

4
00:00:06.083 --> 00:00:08.333
The weird people I met

5
00:00:08.333 --> 00:00:10.283
In fact, it has something to do with you step by step

6
00:00:10.283 --> 00:00:11.666
Since the book is written

7
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.050
You can have the identity of the third master

8
00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:17.233
So one more Hyun Young helps a lot

9
00:00:17.533 --> 00:00:18.600
Take care of everything

10
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.433
What kind of ancient poison did you encounter?

11
00:00:21.483 --> 00:00:23.333
In fact, they are all the cases I left behind

12
00:00:23.333 --> 00:00:26.033
I originally thought that when I was short of money, I went to change it.

13
00:00:26.333 --> 00:00:29.250
But didn't you learn Wuji a little bit?

14
00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.750
Leave them to you.

15
00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:32.666
It is also a must for waste

16
00:00:32.766 --> 00:00:34.700
Uncle Chen said a little bit about Wuji

17
00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:36.750
It seems that the cause of all this

18
00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:38.866
It's all because of Wuji

19
00:00:38.966 --> 00:00:41.333
Yes, I just want to see it.

20
00:00:41.333 --> 00:00:43.600
Xiao Wuji passed on to you a little Wuji

21
00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.250
How is it different from mine?

22
00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:48.000
What's different from that person's?

23
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.433
It turns out that you will also be more infinite

24
00:00:50.483 --> 00:00:51.283
No wonder.

25
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.350
You can't see through it at a glance

26
00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.833
But what I'm curious about is

27
00:00:56.966 --> 00:00:58.233
Who is that guy?

28
00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:59.350
It's your dad

29
00:01:00.533 --> 00:01:03.150
How's your dad?

30
00:01:03.533 --> 00:01:05.283
You say yes, that's it, right?

31
00:01:05.283 --> 00:01:07.750
So my dad understands

32
00:01:08.133 --> 00:01:10.133
It's not a question of understanding what you don't understand

33
00:01:10.133 --> 00:01:13.250
Even the infinity created by Minor Five

34
00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:15.533
This is the way to the road

35
00:01:15.533 --> 00:01:18.266
He's not as deep as your father

36
00:01:18.766 --> 00:01:21.233
It's just that

37
00:01:21.366 --> 00:01:22.800
You obviously look alike

38
00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.950
But nothing like it

39
00:01:26.883 --> 00:01:29.433
If your father were like you

40
00:01:29.966 --> 00:01:31.833
Won't die so soon

41
00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:34.950
So my dad

42
00:01:35.283 --> 00:01:36.666
You killed it too.
