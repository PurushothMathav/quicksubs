00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.866
How dare you kick me?

2
00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:04.800
Are you nuts?

3
00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.166
I'm standing here not moving

4
00:00:06.166 --> 00:00:08.400
White teeth want to slander me

5
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.266
You fucking wait for me, this is not over

6
00:00:14.133 --> 00:00:15.283
You are the store manager, right?

7
00:00:15.283 --> 00:00:16.283
Yes, please.

8
00:00:16.283 --> 00:00:18.483
Do you have a place that specializes in refining medicine?

9
00:00:18.483 --> 00:00:20.550
30,000 an hour

10
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:21.566
I rent it for two hours

11
00:00:21.566 --> 00:00:23.333
Sorry, we have rules in our store.

12
00:00:23.333 --> 00:00:26.383
The rental of alchemists starts from a minimum of 3 hours.

13
00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:27.866
The lounge is also on the second floor.

14
00:00:27.883 --> 00:00:30.700
It's just right to go up together

15
00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.033
If I fucking kill me, I won't leave the weekly diary

16
00:00:37.966 --> 00:00:39.900
Hey, it's almost there

17
00:00:39.966 --> 00:00:42.166
After all, I am also a woman

18
00:00:42.166 --> 00:00:43.800
You keep staring at me like this

19
00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.733
Isn't it a little rude?

20
00:00:45.733 --> 00:00:46.866
You found it.

21
00:00:47.766 --> 00:00:49.800
You've been staring at me since the beginning

22
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.200
If I still can't find it

23
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.333
Isn't that too slow to react?

24
00:00:53.333 --> 00:00:55.200
By the way, what's your name?

25
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.366
Xiao Fan, can I ask you a question?

26
00:00:58.366 --> 00:01:00.800
You ask if you have too much money and are burning in a panic?

27
00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:01.533
What do you mean?

28
00:01:01.533 --> 00:01:04.283
This place is 30,000 an hour

29
00:01:04.283 --> 00:01:06.850
It is comparable to the most expensive suite in Jiangcheng

30
00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:08.300
For one night?

31
00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:09.733
You can't refine medicine

32
00:01:09.733 --> 00:01:12.166
You said your rent is 3 hours.

33
00:01:12.166 --> 00:01:14.600
This is not too much money, what is the panic?

34
00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.800
How do you know I can't refine medicine?

35
00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.150
You can refine medicine
