00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:03.566
Forget it, can you do it?

2
00:00:03.566 --> 00:00:05.700
Why don't you go home and rest for a while?

3
00:00:05.766 --> 00:00:07.333
It's okay, Uncle Chen, don't worry.

4
00:00:07.333 --> 00:00:08.283
I was young.

5
00:00:08.283 --> 00:00:10.633
Just eat more

6
00:00:10.933 --> 00:00:12.850
Then what's wrong with you?

7
00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:14.666
Be sure to tell uncle as soon as possible.

8
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.900
I will, um, eat

9
00:00:22.333 --> 00:00:23.600
Hey, have you heard?

10
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:24.333
In a few days.

11
00:00:24.333 --> 00:00:26.533
Our company is about to hold a shareholders' meeting

12
00:00:26.533 --> 00:00:28.050
There's a shareholders' meeting every month.

13
00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.050
What's so strange about that?

14
00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:29.850
This time is different

15
00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:30.650
Something big happened.

16
00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:31.466
It's about our way

17
00:00:31.966 --> 00:00:33.450
Do you want to know? I have inside information.

18
00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:34.966
Oh, don't sell it.

19
00:00:34.966 --> 00:00:35.966
Say yes now

20
00:00:35.966 --> 00:00:37.000
If you don't tell me, I'll be angry

21
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.366
Okay, okay, I'll tell you.

22
00:00:38.366 --> 00:00:40.033
This dinosaur convention was removed

23
00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:41.850
What? That's impossible.

24
00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.633
Mr. Lu's key has been removed

25
00:00:43.966 --> 00:00:45.200
Who will be the president?

26
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.483
Also, who is Sun Po, Sun Hong's son, and granddaughter is not the master?

27
00:00:47.483 --> 00:00:49.600
The company is about to change

28
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:50.333
Right?

29
00:00:50.333 --> 00:00:52.000
I heard that he commanded father and son for two years

30
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.700
Returned a lot of small shareholders who specifically

31
00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:57.483
Hello, is that you?

32
00:00:57.483 --> 00:00:59.000
Xiao Fan is me

33
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.233
Is that really you?

34
00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:03.350
I beg you I beg you please my grandpa

35
00:01:03.533 --> 00:01:04.950
What's up?

36
00:01:05.083 --> 00:01:06.066
My grandfather he

37
00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.083
My grandfather is dying

38
00:01:09.083 --> 00:01:10.133
I'll be right there.

39
00:01:10.133 --> 00:01:13.100
Uncle Chen, I still have something to leave in advance.

40
00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.550
Are you leaving after dinner?
