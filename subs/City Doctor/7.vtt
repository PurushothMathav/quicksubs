00:00:04.333 --> 00:00:05.133
Hey Xiaofan

2
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:06.250
Where are you?

3
00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:07.333
I brought you dinner

4
00:00:07.333 --> 00:00:09.566
Uncle Chen, aren't you resting today?

5
00:00:09.566 --> 00:00:11.450
Hey can't be idle

6
00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:13.000
The braised pork your aunt made for you today

7
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.400
I also brought you one

8
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.500
It'll be there in a few minutes, just in time to eat while it's hot

9
00:00:22.083 --> 00:00:24.250
Xiao Hei, are you not with Xiaolan?

10
00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:25.450
This is what I cooked for you

11
00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:27.900
You'll be with Xiaolan in a while, get out

12
00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.666
I 20,000 my shoes and this dress 60,000

13
00:00:32.766 --> 00:00:34.733
This is all because I pestered Sun Shao to buy it for me

14
00:00:34.733 --> 00:00:37.900
If you get my skirt dirty, you can pay for it. It's a pity, Lin.

15
00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:41.950
Daughter-in-law Uncle Chen

16
00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:43.633
You haven't left yet

17
00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:45.400
But you came just in time

18
00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:46.600
This old thing

19
00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.000
It's getting my skirt and shoes dirty.

20
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.250
Pay me.

21
00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.166
Lin Kexin, do you still have a conscience?

22
00:00:52.166 --> 00:00:53.883
When I first got out of the elevator

23
00:00:53.883 --> 00:00:54.933
See clearly

24
00:00:54.933 --> 00:00:56.333
You pushed Uncle Chen to the ground

25
00:00:56.333 --> 00:00:58.150
How did Uncle Chen treat you before?

26
00:00:58.166 --> 00:00:59.133
Have you forgotten?

27
00:00:59.133 --> 00:01:00.500
Who told him to pull my leg

28
00:01:00.566 --> 00:01:02.300
Deserved

29
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.100
Uncle Chen has given me a few comrades before

30
00:01:05.166 --> 00:01:08.200
His leg was also wounded on the battlefield

31
00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.533
How can you have a good day without them?

32
00:01:10.533 --> 00:01:11.833
That deserves it

33
00:01:12.683 --> 00:01:13.483
deserve it

34
00:01:14.283 --> 00:01:15.366
I'll let you know today.

35
00:01:15.366 --> 00:01:16.950
What does it mean to really deserve it?
