00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:02.466
Big brother didn't eat here

2
00:00:02.966 --> 00:00:05.483
You can actually block the big brother's sentence

3
00:00:05.483 --> 00:00:06.450
Little sir, please forgive me

4
00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:07.333
You have a lot.

5
00:00:07.333 --> 00:00:08.200
Leave us alone.

6
00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:09.583
Brother, what are you doing?

7
00:00:12.366 --> 00:00:12.966
Sorry big brother

8
00:00:12.966 --> 00:00:13.600
I was wrong, yeah.

9
00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:14.533
I was wrong. I was wrong.

10
00:00:14.533 --> 00:00:17.450
Mr. Xue, look who sent you here

11
00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:19.083
It was Sun Zhifei, that coward, who asked me to come

12
00:00:19.083 --> 00:00:20.050
He gave me 1 million

13
00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:21.466
Let me break your limbs

14
00:00:21.683 --> 00:00:22.566
Do you think this is okay?

15
00:00:22.566 --> 00:00:23.766
I'll give you his 1 million

16
00:00:23.766 --> 00:00:25.250
Then I'll pay you 1 million

17
00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:27.966
2 million how much to give next time

18
00:00:27.966 --> 00:00:30.383
How dare we have a next time

19
00:00:32.966 --> 00:00:34.383
Brother, he is just a small security guard.

20
00:00:34.483 --> 00:00:35.950
It will cost him to shut up

21
00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:37.200
Just a fucking little security guard

22
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.483
If he wanted to kill me just now

23
00:00:38.483 --> 00:00:39.483
That's a minute thing.

24
00:00:39.483 --> 00:00:41.166
Brother, are you Gao Rou?

25
00:00:41.166 --> 00:00:42.050
How is that possible?

26
00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:42.933
With his current strength

27
00:00:42.933 --> 00:00:45.000
I'm afraid only that person can hold him back

28
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.550
Brother, do you mean

29
00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.066
Exactly.

30
00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:51.283
Brother Shan Yu, right?

31
00:00:51.283 --> 00:00:52.900
It's useless to say

32
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.783
I'm going to Blue Cloud Group tomorrow.

33
00:00:55.133 --> 00:00:56.550
Apologize to him personally
