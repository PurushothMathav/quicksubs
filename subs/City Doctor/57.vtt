00:00:01.283 --> 00:00:03.966
Doesn't it seem like a good person not to go home in the middle of the night?

2
00:00:03.966 --> 00:00:07.100
I just said I'm not a good person

3
00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:20.700
Who are you?

4
00:00:36.333 --> 00:00:37.833
Xiaofan Xiaofan

5
00:00:38.533 --> 00:00:41.983
Xiaofan, are you alright?

6
00:00:44.533 --> 00:00:45.333
Xiaofan

7
00:00:49.683 --> 00:00:52.283
Dad, just let him eat and drink

8
00:00:52.283 --> 00:00:53.766
You can't just take care of everything, can you?

9
00:00:53.766 --> 00:00:55.333
I'm afraid I'll come back someday

10
00:00:55.333 --> 00:00:56.900
Look at you half dead

11
00:00:58.283 --> 00:01:00.500
Why are you so talkative?

12
00:01:01.533 --> 00:01:04.633
It's really you who throw water and throw your throat first

13
00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.466
What do you have to say later?
