00:00:00.083 --> 00:00:01.850
Zicheng is fine

2
00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:04.750
It's okay if you don't shut up for your sake

3
00:00:06.133 --> 00:00:08.450
Zicheng, do you still have chest pain recently?

4
00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:09.883
It hurts, why doesn't it hurt?

5
00:00:09.883 --> 00:00:11.283
I can't find anything when I go to the hospital.

6
00:00:11.283 --> 00:00:13.600
The family has contacted the divine doctor Mu Chunfeng.

7
00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:15.583
There should be news soon.

8
00:00:15.683 --> 00:00:17.400
Well, you can skip the trip.

9
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:18.050
What do you mean?

10
00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:19.983
I introduce you to a genius doctor

11
00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:21.050
Just touch it.

12
00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:23.250
Just touch it

13
00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:24.533
You've got to be kidding me!

14
00:00:24.533 --> 00:00:25.533
Don't believe it.

15
00:00:25.533 --> 00:00:26.883
Do you remember my old problem?

16
00:00:26.883 --> 00:00:28.433
Yeah, he did.

17
00:00:29.483 --> 00:00:30.850
What is the name of that genius doctor?

18
00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:32.200
I'll drop by another day

19
00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:33.333
Let him take a look at it for me

20
00:00:33.333 --> 00:00:34.200
No need for another day

21
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.050
Come today.

22
00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:35.850
today

23
00:00:36.366 --> 00:00:39.766
Xiaoyue is not the genius doctor you mentioned, right?

24
00:00:39.766 --> 00:00:41.166
I don't believe it.

25
00:00:41.166 --> 00:00:43.200
Miss Su, I have a name

26
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:43.966
My name is Xiao Fan

27
00:00:43.966 --> 00:00:47.400
Good doctor, please show me

28
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:48.766
What if you look good?

29
00:00:48.766 --> 00:00:50.000
I believe you are a miracle doctor

30
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.383
If you can't see it well, hum.

31
00:00:53.766 --> 00:00:54.483
You are not sick

32
00:00:54.483 --> 00:00:55.433
Look at Zhang Yun

33
00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:56.800
My chest has been hurting for so long

34
00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:57.966
He said there was nothing wrong with me.

35
00:00:57.966 --> 00:00:59.966
Isn't this talking nonsense, Xiaofan?

36
00:00:59.966 --> 00:01:01.083
Did you read it wrong?

37
00:01:01.083 --> 00:01:01.933
I read it right

38
00:01:01.933 --> 00:01:04.000
He's not sick, so why is he?

39
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.900
That's because there are worms sucking blood on his heart
