00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:01.800
After you left my house?

2
00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:03.650
A group of inexplicable people broke in

3
00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:04.683
Did the old lady practice?

4
00:00:04.683 --> 00:00:06.566
It was one punch, one kick, two

5
00:00:06.566 --> 00:00:08.200
Come one and pour one, come two and pour a pair

6
00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:10.450
I stuttered in anger and fell a large piece

7
00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:13.400
And you can see what's up there.

8
00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.100
Let me see what's there.

9
00:00:16.683 --> 00:00:18.966
I'll let you do it later when you're done.

10
00:00:18.966 --> 00:00:21.250
Let's get down to business first, then you talk about what's in the sky first

11
00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:22.883
Cow, how can there be a cow

12
00:00:22.883 --> 00:00:23.833
Why didn't I see it?

13
00:00:23.883 --> 00:00:26.033
You blew to death.

14
00:00:26.333 --> 00:00:28.900
Every time you appear in front of me, it's like this animation

15
00:00:28.933 --> 00:00:30.950
I really don't know how long I can hold on

16
00:00:31.883 --> 00:00:33.883
There is a way to do it once and for all

17
00:00:33.883 --> 00:00:35.033
Do you want to try it?

18
00:00:35.883 --> 00:00:39.500
What cuts you off?

19
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.366
Okay, let's get down to business first

20
00:00:42.366 --> 00:00:44.900
Hmph, look at what you just said

21
00:00:45.283 --> 00:00:48.500
Uh, speaking of you, whoa whoa whoa whoa

22
00:00:49.133 --> 00:00:50.533
Let's skip your bragging first

23
00:00:50.533 --> 00:00:51.366
Why skip

24
00:00:51.366 --> 00:00:53.366
Do you not believe me? Do you doubt me?

25
00:00:53.366 --> 00:00:55.933
Okay, you're amazing, aren't you, auntie?

26
00:00:55.933 --> 00:00:56.983
business matters

27
00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:58.333
You go on first

28
00:00:58.333 --> 00:01:00.233
Wait until I turn back and continue to listen to you

29
00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.150
The world of beating

30
00:01:02.333 --> 00:01:04.450
Truer than real gold

31
00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:06.033
Then believe in you once a day

32
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.833
Thank you. Thank you.

33
00:01:07.933 --> 00:01:10.866
At that time, I hula-la blew down a large area

34
00:01:11.133 --> 00:01:12.033
I bah
