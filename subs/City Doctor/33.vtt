00:00:00.283 --> 00:00:01.300
Then get on your knees

2
00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:04.133
Kowtow and apologize, haha.

3
00:00:04.133 --> 00:00:05.800
It's just 400,000

4
00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:07.166
Who says I can't afford that?

5
00:00:07.166 --> 00:00:09.483
You turtle, you still dare to speak up

6
00:00:09.483 --> 00:00:10.766
Then go to the checkout

7
00:00:10.766 --> 00:00:12.250
I can put the ugly thing up front

8
00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:14.800
Don't blame me for being ruthless if you can't pay

9
00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:17.266
Even punchlines are useless to plead for you

10
00:00:17.533 --> 00:00:19.633
Do you want to pay by mobile phone or by credit card?

11
00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:21.466
Credit.

12
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.300
No, the payment was successful.

13
00:00:32.083 --> 00:00:33.266
How is that possible?

14
00:00:34.366 --> 00:00:35.533
Wrong, right, right, right.

15
00:00:35.533 --> 00:00:37.283
I'd better check it out.

16
00:00:37.283 --> 00:00:38.050
Which guest is it?

17
00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:40.133
Just spent 400,000 in our store

18
00:00:40.133 --> 00:00:43.150
How about a travel bet?

19
00:00:43.566 --> 00:00:45.583
Bet what bet

20
00:00:46.366 --> 00:00:47.633
Funny you

21
00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:49.650
Zhou Jing should be honest

22
00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:51.000
You are breaking your word

23
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.000
What unbelievable

24
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.066
Empty talk

25
00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:55.100
Do you have any evidence?
