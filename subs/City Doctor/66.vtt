00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:02.466
Grandpa, why did you hit me?

2
00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:04.866
It's you prodigal thing

3
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.166
Do you know who he is?

4
00:00:07.166 --> 00:00:09.000
He is the savior of the old man

5
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.783
What? How is that possible?

6
00:00:11.166 --> 00:00:12.650
Dad, this is the cure for grandpa

7
00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:15.266
The person grandpa asked me to accompany

8
00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.500
It's him who quickly apologizes to him

9
00:00:19.566 --> 00:00:21.933
Hmm, you can do it without apologizing.

10
00:00:21.933 --> 00:00:24.133
Anyway, starting today

11
00:00:24.133 --> 00:00:27.483
Your monthly allowance is down to 100,000

12
00:00:27.483 --> 00:00:29.050
And your property.

13
00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:30.100
Car

14
00:00:30.283 --> 00:00:34.650
And all the assets and shares of the old man must be recovered

15
00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:36.450
No grandpa I apologize

16
00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:37.800
Can I apologize?

17
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.766
Brother Fan is my eyes but I don't know Mount Tai

18
00:00:39.766 --> 00:00:40.850
You adults don't remember villains

19
00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:41.566
Spare me this time

20
00:00:41.566 --> 00:00:44.100
No more, just slap me twice.

21
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.433
This time it's for your grandfather's sake

22
00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.100
Forgive you

23
00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:51.150
Go back.

24
00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:53.550
Just being polite to you.

25
00:00:54.366 --> 00:00:56.266
Fucking ugly

26
00:00:57.083 --> 00:00:58.266
Ugly what ugly

27
00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.766
Dad, you lack of string

28
00:01:00.766 --> 00:01:02.333
He still seeks revenge every day

29
00:01:02.333 --> 00:01:04.050
Do you know the origin of this Xiao Fan?

30
00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:05.650
Even your grandfather's bodyguard

31
00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:06.900
No match for him

32
00:01:06.966 --> 00:01:08.233
How is that possible?

33
00:01:08.966 --> 00:01:10.683
I'm telling you that's the truth.

34
00:01:10.683 --> 00:01:12.733
I was in the house watching him break in

35
00:01:12.733 --> 00:01:14.766
I thought he was sneaking in

36
00:01:14.766 --> 00:01:16.233
I found out later

37
00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:18.600
Your grandfather's tiled guards were all brought down by him

38
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.300
Don't blame me for not warning you.

39
00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:21.966
Make friends with him quickly

40
00:01:21.966 --> 00:01:23.966
Even if your grandfather spared you

41
00:01:23.966 --> 00:01:25.383
I won't forgive you either.
