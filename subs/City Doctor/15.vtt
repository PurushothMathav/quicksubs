00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.000
Humph

2
00:00:01.333 --> 00:00:03.083
What does excellence wait for?

3
00:00:03.083 --> 00:00:04.433
Get out of here

4
00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:06.166
It's still embarrassing here

5
00:00:06.166 --> 00:00:06.766
Director Ying

6
00:00:06.766 --> 00:00:09.083
I am willing to guarantee the reputation of Blue Cloud Group

7
00:00:09.083 --> 00:00:10.566
Xiao Fan can definitely cure your illness

8
00:00:10.566 --> 00:00:11.733
If he can't be cured

9
00:00:11.733 --> 00:00:14.066
I am willing to compensate you 100 million.

10
00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:17.300
Wow, a billion.

11
00:00:17.333 --> 00:00:20.600
Lu Chaoyue, although you have money and nowhere to spend, you want to burn a handful

12
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.733
But Blue Silver Group is not yours alone.

13
00:00:22.733 --> 00:00:25.433
And Uncle Ying's real life

14
00:00:26.083 --> 00:00:28.083
But not just you.

15
00:00:28.083 --> 00:00:29.850
Mr. Lu, don't be angry

16
00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:32.333
Even if you want to send 100 million to Yin Dong now

17
00:00:32.333 --> 00:00:33.600
Then I'm afraid there is no chance.

18
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.533
Dong Yin only needs to take my special medicine now

19
00:00:35.533 --> 00:00:38.200
You will be cured in half an hour at most.

20
00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:39.633
Just your trash

21
00:00:39.683 --> 00:00:41.300
I just want to cure Yin Dong's illness

22
00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:43.566
Look at the door and dare to say that my special effects are rubbish

23
00:00:43.566 --> 00:00:45.133
You are rubbish

24
00:00:45.133 --> 00:00:47.000
Uncle Lin, find someone to throw them out

25
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.533
Well, if you don't want to die

26
00:00:48.533 --> 00:00:49.800
Get out of his light now

27
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.000
It's not me who wants to die, it's you

28
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.850
If you did eat his garbage

29
00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:56.483
Then you can't die anymore

30
00:00:56.483 --> 00:00:59.150
I won the sea and I can live your life

31
00:01:01.883 --> 00:01:03.800
Did the watchdog see it and understand?

32
00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.483
Nothing happened at all

33
00:01:05.483 --> 00:01:07.433
And my special effects

34
00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.383
No problem.

35
00:01:09.933 --> 00:01:11.133
Call now

36
00:01:11.133 --> 00:01:13.133
Let someone raise a new billion for you.

37
00:01:13.133 --> 00:01:16.000
Ahahahaha, I'll hand them over.

38
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.150
It's okay, don't worry.

39
00:01:17.366 --> 00:01:18.600
It's this time

40
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.733
How dare you say it doesn't matter

41
00:01:20.733 --> 00:01:21.666
I will be happy

42
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.350
Hey, hey, Uncle Lin
