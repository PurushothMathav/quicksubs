00:00:00.566 --> 00:00:02.433
I see when you can install it.

2
00:00:02.533 --> 00:00:06.800
Okay, raise your hand if you support the second child's night is like a dragon

3
00:00:07.033 --> 00:00:08.333
I support

4
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:17.700
Support Ye Rulong

5
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:19.933
Number of votes to be elected chairperson of the Night Market Group

6
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:21.600
Unanimously approved

7
00:00:25.566 --> 00:00:28.000
Ye Tianse, what did you just say?

8
00:00:28.033 --> 00:00:31.633
Choice can send night market stock prices tumbling

9
00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:34.800
Let the shareholders suffer losses, right?

10
00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:35.800
I Zhang

11
00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.966
The ownership ratio of the Ye family's stock is the highest

12
00:00:38.966 --> 00:00:42.833
Hey, let me see if you lose one, okay?

13
00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.600
Notify to execute the acquisition machine

14
00:00:48.633 --> 00:00:49.833
Within 10 minutes

15
00:00:49.833 --> 00:00:52.733
I want to become the largest stock in the night market group

16
00:00:55.233 --> 00:00:56.500
So here we go.

17
00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:57.833
A small security guard

18
00:00:57.833 --> 00:01:00.366
A gift for everyone here

19
00:01:00.366 --> 00:01:01.866
Hope you like it.

20
00:01:01.966 --> 00:01:03.300
pretend

21
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.300
Do you want to do an empty night market stock?

22
00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.633
The first imperial court became the largest night market

23
00:01:07.633 --> 00:01:09.800
What do shareholders think?

24
00:01:09.966 --> 00:01:11.800
But this series of operations

25
00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.300
A minimum of 10 billion is required

26
00:01:14.766 --> 00:01:17.133
You are so stupid

27
00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.500
Like this kind of talk outside the door

28
00:01:19.533 --> 00:01:21.000
Only those

29
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.733
A little security guard who has never seen the world

30
00:01:23.833 --> 00:01:25.133
To say it

31
00:01:25.133 --> 00:01:27.000
You sound like a layman.

32
00:01:27.033 --> 00:01:29.233
I guess I don't even understand the k-line diagram

33
00:01:29.233 --> 00:01:29.433
Hey

34
00:01:29.433 --> 00:01:33.466
Did you know that buying stocks requires technical analysis?

35
00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.333
This kind of subordinate who actually appeared in the richest man in the building

36
00:01:37.366 --> 00:01:39.700
What a family tragedy

37
00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.033
It is the sadness of the entire consortium

38
00:01:43.033 --> 00:01:45.266
Hahahaha

39
00:01:49.333 --> 00:01:50.133
Hello

40
00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:52.600
What!
