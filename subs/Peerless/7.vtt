00:00:00.466 --> 00:00:02.666
Are you blind?

2
00:00:02.666 --> 00:00:04.033
I can't even tell.

3
00:00:04.633 --> 00:00:07.433
You are kicked out

4
00:00:07.566 --> 00:00:09.633
Don't worry, I will.

5
00:00:09.633 --> 00:00:12.533
Treat yourself like your own daughter

6
00:00:12.733 --> 00:00:13.433
Sign it.

7
00:00:13.433 --> 00:00:16.366
I don't need a useless husband Mengmeng

8
00:00:16.433 --> 00:00:17.966
I don't need a useless father

9
00:00:17.966 --> 00:00:19.033
He follows you.

10
00:00:19.033 --> 00:00:22.800
It will only become a little waste that feeds him

11
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:25.933
Mom, don't divorce dad

12
00:00:25.933 --> 00:00:28.966
I will never make you angry again.

13
00:00:28.966 --> 00:00:31.066
No, money, fame and fortune

14
00:00:31.366 --> 00:00:32.466
Is it better than giving Mengmeng

15
00:00:32.466 --> 00:00:34.100
Is a complete home more important?

16
00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:35.366
For me

17
00:00:35.666 --> 00:00:36.733
Extraordinarily important

18
00:00:36.733 --> 00:00:38.733
And Mengmeng follows me

19
00:00:38.733 --> 00:00:41.933
It must be a thousand times better than following you.

20
00:00:41.933 --> 00:00:45.633
1,400 is expensive because you are too useless.

21
00:00:45.733 --> 00:00:46.833
International School

22
00:00:46.833 --> 00:00:47.933
Travel abroad

23
00:00:47.933 --> 00:00:50.766
What can you give Mammy for designer clothes?

24
00:00:50.766 --> 00:00:53.566
You want Mammy to grow up like you

25
00:00:54.266 --> 00:00:55.900
Nod and bow to others?

26
00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:57.966
Wake up. Okay.

27
00:00:58.066 --> 00:00:59.000
I'm waiting for a dream

28
00:00:59.033 --> 00:01:02.000
I sign dad, you can't sign

29
00:01:06.466 --> 00:01:09.766
Well, Dad can't give you a whole family anymore

30
00:01:09.766 --> 00:01:11.866
Follow your mother well in the future

31
00:01:11.866 --> 00:01:13.400
Dad doesn't want you either.

32
00:01:28.366 --> 00:01:29.200
Ah!

33
00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.000
Emperor, do me a favor

34
00:01:32.066 --> 00:01:33.300
Send the favor back

35
00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:34.533
I still have something to deal with

36
00:01:34.533 --> 00:01:37.133
I can't do it. The evening banquet is approved

37
00:01:54.333 --> 00:01:55.366
You little thing

38
00:01:55.366 --> 00:01:56.566
Don't you have eyes?

39
00:01:56.566 --> 00:01:59.100
Your father will never be good at my shoes.

40
00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.033
You can't even afford it.

41
00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:02.300
Sorry, I was wrong.

42
00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:04.233
If you do something wrong, you will be punished.

43
00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:05.466
Get over here

44
00:02:05.833 --> 00:02:06.866
Get over here

45
00:02:08.733 --> 00:02:10.933
No no no
