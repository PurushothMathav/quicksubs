00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:04.133
A total of 100 companies invested in the night market

2
00:00:04.133 --> 00:00:07.300
Including family chaebol groups around the world

3
00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:09.800
Private equity is not so much nonsense

4
00:00:09.866 --> 00:00:11.200
The one with the most capital injection

5
00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:12.633
The top five will do

6
00:00:12.633 --> 00:00:16.500
The most invested is the Rothschild family

7
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.366
Hahaha, did you see it?

8
00:00:18.433 --> 00:00:21.200
The one with the most capital injection is Ross Cai

9
00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.300
What? You're right.

10
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.033
That's the oldest syndicate family in the world

11
00:00:27.133 --> 00:00:29.633
Once controlled the world's financial life

12
00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:33.033
The strength behind it is too great to be reconciled

13
00:00:33.033 --> 00:00:34.900
How could it be wrong?

14
00:00:35.233 --> 00:00:36.300
Not only this one

15
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.200
Return the Walker family

16
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.900

South African sheikh

19
00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.366
Too many to count

20
00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.133
Just these people

21
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.400
These families and interviews are world-class interpretations

22
00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:49.866
They're big.

23
00:00:49.866 --> 00:00:51.366
You can't afford to offend

24
00:00:51.433 --> 00:00:53.600
Right? What?

25
00:00:53.633 --> 00:00:56.433
Why because you are blind and cute?

26
00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:59.366
I can't see what I can do every night

27
00:00:59.433 --> 00:01:00.900
Aren't you very good at barking?

28
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:02.566
Come on, keep barking

29
00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.733
Did I choose the wrong one again?

30
00:01:05.933 --> 00:01:07.133
Less people do

31
00:01:07.133 --> 00:01:08.900
So is Ye Rulong

32
00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.866
I, Chu Ruoxi, want to argue, why is it so difficult?

33
00:01:11.866 --> 00:01:14.100
No, I ask to teach

34
00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:14.633
Are you crazy?

35
00:01:14.633 --> 00:01:17.233
You beg those continents, how many heads do you have?

36
00:01:17.233 --> 00:01:19.833
But no, but if you lose, you lose.

37
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.033
You are presumptuous

38
00:01:21.033 --> 00:01:22.233
You have the ability

39
00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:23.933
Waiter, don't do it too early.

40
00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:28.333
It's time for the building chamber of commerce election to officially start

41
00:01:28.333 --> 00:01:30.633
Manager Zhang is invited to enter
