00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.866
Mr. Ye, I have a good idea

2
00:00:02.866 --> 00:00:03.866
How?

3
00:00:03.866 --> 00:00:06.966
Said that this waste must not be kept

4
00:00:06.966 --> 00:00:09.500
If you want me to see it, just kill it

5
00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:11.400
As for that little extermination

6
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.633
Ye Shao, leave it to me, I promise I can let you buy it.

7
00:00:15.666 --> 00:00:17.233
You old thing

8
00:00:17.466 --> 00:00:18.700
Pretty cruel

9
00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:19.400
Ye Shao

10
00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.800
It is my blessing to be able to solve your problems.

11
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.600
I am from the Chu family of the Nanjia family

12
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.700
Please remember that.

13
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:27.600
Hahaha

14
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:29.300
roll

15
00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:33.200
Yesha, why are you hitting me?

16
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.900
What are you?

17
00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:36.800
Jumping up and down here

18
00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.366
My Ye family's family affairs

19
00:00:38.366 --> 00:00:40.733
When is it your turn to intervene?

20
00:00:40.733 --> 00:00:43.433
Ye Tianci is my big brother

21
00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:45.866
How could I do anything to him?

22
00:00:45.966 --> 00:00:47.000
Hahaha

23
00:00:47.133 --> 00:00:50.833
Let others know that I swear not to kill murderers

24
00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:52.700
How should I behave in the future?

25
00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.000
Long Long, how about you?

26
00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.366
Yes, for me.

27
00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:04.366
At the end of the road, you are a divine sword master

28
00:01:04.366 --> 00:01:05.800
Surprised by him

29
00:01:05.933 --> 00:01:07.366
Excalibur Flame Box

30
00:01:07.533 --> 00:01:10.100
The owner knows you work for him

31
00:01:10.133 --> 00:01:11.266
What to explain

32
00:01:11.566 --> 00:01:14.433
When do you dare to threaten

33
00:01:14.533 --> 00:01:16.100
Do you think I don't know?

34
00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:17.933
The shopkeeper is long gone

35
00:01:17.933 --> 00:01:21.100
Over the years, executives have been looking for the owner's project

36
00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.466
Otherwise this kind of thing will be done

37
00:01:23.466 --> 00:01:25.233
I'll give you one last chance.

38
00:01:25.766 --> 00:01:28.900
Do you have any last words when you die?

39
00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:31.066
You did that, right?

40
00:01:31.533 --> 00:01:32.966
I really have

41
00:01:32.966 --> 00:01:35.600
It's so tacky and brutal

42
00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.333
I can't even watch it anymore

43
00:01:37.333 --> 00:01:38.966
If there is anything, let him say it quickly

44
00:01:39.266 --> 00:01:40.233
Do it for me

45
00:01:41.066 --> 00:01:42.900
Greet your mother well.
