1
00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:01.233
Get lost

2
00:00:01.466 --> 00:00:03.966
You are enough, you are just lucky

3
00:00:03.966 --> 00:00:04.366
You don't

4
00:00:04.366 --> 00:00:06.733
I think I can bully people casually with a little money

5
00:00:06.733 --> 00:00:08.433
Do you still have any public morality?

6
00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:10.400
You have to ask why there are so few bullies.

7
00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.766
You put more than 20 embroidery needles

8
00:00:12.933 --> 00:00:14.266
Dive deeply into a five

9
00:00:14.266 --> 00:00:15.833
In the body of a six-year-old child

10
00:00:16.066 --> 00:00:18.966
How much pain does Mengmeng have to suffer day and night?

11
00:00:19.133 --> 00:00:20.500
Mengmeng dare not say

12
00:00:20.533 --> 00:00:21.833
Mengmeng can't say

13
00:00:21.966 --> 00:00:23.333
Mengmeng doesn't understand at all

14
00:00:23.333 --> 00:00:25.033
She was supposed to take care of her grandmother

15
00:00:25.066 --> 00:00:26.633
Why did you do this to her?

16
00:00:26.933 --> 00:00:28.166
The most shameless

17
00:00:28.166 --> 00:00:30.533
The most vicious thing is you old woman

18
00:00:30.533 --> 00:00:32.666
A thousand times you shut up

19
00:00:32.666 --> 00:00:34.866
After all, I am also your elder.

20
00:00:34.866 --> 00:00:36.566
How dare you speak to me like that?

21
00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:38.100
elder

22
00:00:38.166 --> 00:00:40.666
You think you need to be respected when you get older

23
00:00:40.666 --> 00:00:42.933
Do you think you can sell your old age as you get older?

24
00:00:42.933 --> 00:00:45.200
You can ride on my head and make a fortune

25
00:00:45.366 --> 00:00:46.800
That's the plan.

26
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.500
I'll tell you the traditional virtues of Daxiao

27
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:50.900
Filial piety comes first

28
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.300
Mengmeng is watching here

29
00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:53.733
How dare you disrespect me

30
00:00:53.733 --> 00:00:56.100
In the future, Mengmeng will be disrespectful to you when she grows up

31
00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.600
How dare you hit me?

32
00:00:57.933 --> 00:01:00.200
The day you lie in the hospital bed

33
00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.266
We can unplug your oxygen tube

34
00:01:02.466 --> 00:01:04.633
How do you speak?

35
00:01:04.766 --> 00:01:06.066
Don't you dare?

36
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:07.966
Do you feel guilty?

37
00:01:08.266 --> 00:01:09.100
Xiuxia

38
00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:10.800
Selling the old way

39
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.033
Disrespect for the father

40
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.333
shameless

41
00:01:13.333 --> 00:01:14.800
You are a corpse

42
00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:16.466
An old age

43
00:01:16.566 --> 00:01:19.066
Who will give you face if you are shameless?

44
00:01:20.066 --> 00:01:21.900
You you dharma eye king

45
00:01:22.166 --> 00:01:25.033
Back then, our family saved you
