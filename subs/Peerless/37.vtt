00:00:00.433 --> 00:00:01.233
shopkeeper

2
00:00:01.933 --> 00:00:03.866
He's a little guy after all

3
00:00:04.533 --> 00:00:07.133
He doesn't have that much courage. I can fly.

4
00:00:07.133 --> 00:00:09.066
I can live forever

5
00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:12.533
Who says I can't pull it out?

6
00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:16.333
It's time to wake up that lost memory

7
00:00:20.633 --> 00:00:22.566
He really pulled it out

8
00:00:22.566 --> 00:00:24.000
What if you pull it out?

9
00:00:24.133 --> 00:00:25.766
He's all gone.

10
00:00:25.766 --> 00:00:26.666
How is that possible?

11
00:00:26.666 --> 00:00:27.900
Pull out the big cage bird

12
00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.633
How could there be no response at all?

13
00:00:29.733 --> 00:00:32.566
Hahahaha because he is an impostor.

14
00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:36.600
Prince Tang took out the Excalibur Dragon and couldn't go for a moment

15
00:00:36.666 --> 00:00:38.200
But it will be reflected by the sword

16
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:39.266
Blade and Soul

17
00:00:39.266 --> 00:00:42.133
I will not let go of anyone who falls into the sword

18
00:00:42.166 --> 00:00:43.066
How could this be?

19
00:00:43.066 --> 00:00:45.933
Could it be that he is really not the owner of the temple?

20
00:00:55.466 --> 00:00:56.600
Subversion

21
00:00:56.666 --> 00:00:57.766
Humans are invincible

22
00:00:57.833 --> 00:01:00.166
We can be brave enough to promise

23
00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:08.433
Uncle, I don't want you to cook Ruoxi

24
00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.733
Watch him. He's going to die.

25
00:01:10.733 --> 00:01:14.000
At that time, you and the emperor will still be a couple

26
00:01:14.133 --> 00:01:17.566
Is that possible? Oh, what do you care about that little bastard?

27
00:01:17.566 --> 00:01:19.066
That's not right.

28
00:01:20.933 --> 00:01:22.066
I Am Him

29
00:01:25.366 --> 00:01:26.800
How is that possible?
