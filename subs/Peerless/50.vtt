00:00:00.533 --> 00:00:03.766
Thank goodness what did you do?

2
00:00:03.833 --> 00:00:04.900
Didn't do anything.

3
00:00:05.066 --> 00:00:06.433
Is to let the people under your command

4
00:00:06.433 --> 00:00:07.933
Just buy some stocks for fun

5
00:00:07.933 --> 00:00:09.433
Why are you afraid?

6
00:00:09.433 --> 00:00:13.033
Impossible Temple Lord has chosen another person

7
00:00:13.033 --> 00:00:14.833
What other subordinates do you have?

8
00:00:15.766 --> 00:00:16.566
Phoenix

9
00:00:17.233 --> 00:00:21.700
No way that woman doesn't understand business, Dad

10
00:00:21.766 --> 00:00:23.233
Don't be fooled by him.

11
00:00:23.233 --> 00:00:24.566
It's just a coincidence

12
00:00:24.566 --> 00:00:25.766
A phone call.

13
00:00:25.766 --> 00:00:26.866
How can it be possible to put leaves

14
00:00:26.866 --> 00:00:29.433
Buy all the shares in the hands of the shareholders?

15
00:00:29.766 --> 00:00:30.533
I doubt it.

16
00:00:30.533 --> 00:00:33.366
Someone must have taken action against our Ye family

17
00:00:33.366 --> 00:00:36.833
The problem is that the stocks of the major shareholders are now

18
00:00:36.833 --> 00:00:39.533
It has all flowed into the Ye family

19
00:00:39.866 --> 00:00:42.766
What? How is that possible?

20
00:00:42.933 --> 00:00:44.866
Isn't this a sales sniper?

21
00:00:44.866 --> 00:00:45.933
My Ye family

22
00:00:45.933 --> 00:00:49.066
It is now a wholly-owned Yip consortium

23
00:00:49.066 --> 00:00:50.066
My Ye family

24
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.800
This time I really have a chance to fight for Great Xia

25
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.766
President of the Chamber of Commerce

26
00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:57.033
Got it.

27
00:00:57.066 --> 00:01:01.133
You must have pretended to be the owner of the temple and asked the temple to help

28
00:01:01.133 --> 00:01:04.800
Dad, I'm going to the Building Chamber of Commerce to report him now

29
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.500
Ok, I'll wait.

30
00:01:06.533 --> 00:01:10.033
I'd like to see what the building chamber of commerce can do

31
00:01:10.033 --> 00:01:11.866
Hello

32
00:01:11.866 --> 00:01:13.066
You have damn grass

33
00:01:13.566 --> 00:01:14.333
Dad?

34
00:01:14.333 --> 00:01:17.166
He offended all the shareholders of our night market today

35
00:01:17.266 --> 00:01:19.266
All shareholders leave

36
00:01:19.266 --> 00:01:21.166
How will we operate in the future?

37
00:01:21.166 --> 00:01:23.233
Is that a problem?

38
00:01:23.466 --> 00:01:24.733
He's cool

39
00:01:25.133 --> 00:01:28.300
But my Ye family has suffered an unprecedented blow

40
00:01:28.333 --> 00:01:29.233
ridiculous

41
00:01:29.333 --> 00:01:31.700
You take those ordinary people too seriously.

42
00:01:31.733 --> 00:01:33.733
It's just a bunch of wine bags and rice bags

43
00:01:33.733 --> 00:01:34.900
Without them

44
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.800
Night market groups can only be better

45
00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:37.933
What do you mean?

46
00:01:38.133 --> 00:01:40.633
The night market group has become the richest man in a building

47
00:01:40.933 --> 00:01:42.166
Within three months

48
00:01:42.466 --> 00:01:44.833
The night market will be led by me, Ye Tianci

49
00:01:44.833 --> 00:01:47.033
Become the number one in the world's top 500

50
00:01:47.033 --> 00:01:49.266
You are not afraid that the wind will reward your tongue

51
00:01:49.266 --> 00:01:51.100
You said it yourself.

52
00:01:51.166 --> 00:01:54.266
My career is like a dragon, and I will quit the industrialist starting today.

53
00:01:54.266 --> 00:01:57.933
With the major shareholders, the president of the Chang'an Building Chamber of Commerce

54
00:01:58.166 --> 00:01:59.400
Back against the temple

55
00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:00.666
millionaire

56
00:02:00.666 --> 00:02:03.133
You and you

57
00:02:03.166 --> 00:02:05.666
Then don't cry and marry me back
