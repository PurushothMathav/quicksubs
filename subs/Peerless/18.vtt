00:00:02.166 --> 00:00:05.300
God send you the richest man now

2
00:00:05.533 --> 00:00:07.600
Does it have anything to do with you?

3
00:00:08.166 --> 00:00:09.400
Of course it does.

4
00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:10.900
Are you my husband?

5
00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:12.733
Is my wealth half that?

6
00:00:12.733 --> 00:00:14.300
But we're divorced.

7
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.400
Are we not hazy?

8
00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.866
We don't have children and can get remarried.

9
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:20.833
Ruoxi

10
00:00:21.133 --> 00:00:23.333
Your behavior makes me sick.

11
00:00:23.433 --> 00:00:25.966
You've humiliated me all these years

12
00:00:25.966 --> 00:00:28.300
I have endured until now for Mengmeng

13
00:00:28.366 --> 00:00:31.300
Now you see that I have inherited the wealth of the Ye family

14
00:00:31.733 --> 00:00:33.466
I ran over and called my husband

15
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.633
I mean it.

16
00:00:36.633 --> 00:00:38.300
I'm just a little career-minded

17
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.400
And you see this apologetic asset

18
00:00:40.533 --> 00:00:41.766
You can't control it.

19
00:00:41.766 --> 00:00:43.133
But I can!

20
00:00:43.133 --> 00:00:44.000
Let's go together.

21
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.333
We have been managing our property together for years

22
00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:47.733
You insult me and scold me

23
00:00:47.733 --> 00:00:50.433
Don't you know how many slaps you've slapped me?

24
00:00:50.433 --> 00:00:52.033
Why is Mengmeng so timid?

25
00:00:52.033 --> 00:00:53.566
No, it's because he grew up

26
00:00:53.566 --> 00:00:54.433
Watching you hit me

27
00:00:54.433 --> 00:00:55.900
Are you scolding me for growing up?

28
00:00:55.933 --> 00:00:57.333
I used to have no money.

29
00:00:57.366 --> 00:00:58.233
For Mengmeng

30
00:00:58.566 --> 00:01:00.100
I won everything

31
00:01:00.333 --> 00:01:01.500
But now.

32
00:01:01.733 --> 00:01:04.133
I'm sorry I'm rich

33
00:01:04.166 --> 00:01:05.933
You can't afford it.

34
00:01:07.633 --> 00:01:08.833
I see.

35
00:01:09.166 --> 00:01:10.400
It's all my fault

36
00:01:10.733 --> 00:01:12.500
Mom, be honest

37
00:01:12.566 --> 00:01:13.500
Have you ever hit Mengmeng?

38
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.433
I I

39
00:01:15.633 --> 00:01:17.700
What time is it?

40
00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.033
I don't just think he's a drag bottle

41
00:01:20.133 --> 00:01:22.533
As soon as I get angry, I put the embroidery needle

42
00:01:22.566 --> 00:01:24.333
Got stuck in his body

43
00:01:26.133 --> 00:01:30.500
It's not much, it's just slag, it's more than 20 steps

44
00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:31.466
What!
