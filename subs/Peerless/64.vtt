1
00:00:01.133 --> 00:00:02.866
Richest heir, right?

2
00:00:03.533 --> 00:00:05.233
President of the Chamber of Commerce, right?

3
00:00:09.833 --> 00:00:11.733
I splashed the heir to protect the heir

4
00:00:11.733 --> 00:00:12.966
Any comments?

5
00:00:12.966 --> 00:00:14.333
Ask everyone here

6
00:00:14.333 --> 00:00:15.466
Who has an opinion?

7
00:00:15.733 --> 00:00:16.900
stand up

8
00:00:17.433 --> 00:00:20.166
Oolong is carrying one grain

9
00:00:20.166 --> 00:00:23.933
Yes, I will bear all the consequences.

10
00:00:24.033 --> 00:00:26.433
You are responsible. What qualifications do you have to be responsible for?

11
00:00:26.433 --> 00:00:28.100
Do you have the ability to be responsible?

12
00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:29.200
I might as well tell you

13
00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.600
I really have this qualification

14
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.200
The managers have already explained to me just now.

15
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.133
I am the chairperson of the Chamber of Commerce this time

16
00:00:38.766 --> 00:00:39.900
Hahaha

17
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.333
Young Master Ye, you are really the president?

18
00:00:43.333 --> 00:00:46.233
What kind of heir do you want to fight with this trash?

19
00:00:46.233 --> 00:00:48.000
After you are elected president

20
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.566
The whole night market has to kneel

21
00:00:50.566 --> 00:00:51.700
Please go back

22
00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:53.000
What you said

23
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.766
It seems that these five years

24
00:00:55.766 --> 00:00:58.300
The temple is getting more and more unruly

25
00:00:59.566 --> 00:01:00.466
rules

26
00:01:00.533 --> 00:01:03.800
Dare to mention the rules in front of the stewards 3 times

27
00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.133
Have you had enough?

28
00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:10.900
Let me teach you what the rules are

29
00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:11.866
Chu Ruoxi

30
00:01:14.166 --> 00:01:18.100
Today I'll tell you what the damn rules are

31
00:01:18.166 --> 00:01:19.500
What do you want?

32
00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:21.466
What's up?
