00:00:00.633 --> 00:00:02.633
Boy I don't mean anything else

2
00:00:02.633 --> 00:00:04.233
I have something to do first

3
00:00:04.233 --> 00:00:06.800
I believe we will meet

4
00:00:08.666 --> 00:00:10.466
Are you crazy?

5
00:00:10.466 --> 00:00:12.733
Hands on adults hands on adults

6
00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:15.866
Brother Ru, help me check someone

7
00:00:15.866 --> 00:00:17.100
I want all his information

8
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.533
Wife Now

9
00:00:23.466 --> 00:00:25.400
Wife Ruoxi

10
00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.533
Ruoxi is not our child

11
00:00:30.233 --> 00:00:31.866
What did you call me?

12
00:00:33.633 --> 00:00:35.300
Mr. Chu Chu, let me tell you

13
00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.500
If it weren't for grandpa saying that you were a real dragon life

14
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.800
Brother asked me to share your bed and have a baby

15
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.166
If these girls weren't for Mengmeng

16
00:00:43.266 --> 00:00:44.966
I would have kicked you out long ago

17
00:00:44.966 --> 00:00:46.533
Say what you just did

18
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:47.933
What else can I do?

19
00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.633
I'm protecting Mengmeng, protecting Mengmeng

20
00:00:50.633 --> 00:00:53.000
Do you know who you drove away just now?

21
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.600
What those people say I mean I don't know

22
00:00:55.633 --> 00:00:57.233
I know Mengmeng is our child

23
00:00:57.233 --> 00:00:58.700
Even if I'm just a small security guard

24
00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:59.966
I want to protect him too

25
00:00:59.966 --> 00:01:02.066
What else do you do besides this?

26
00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:03.900
You are a waste in my eyes

27
00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:05.400
How dare you talk back?

28
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.400
Can you afford the loss I suffered?

29
00:01:07.433 --> 00:01:10.366
Waste, waste, am I so unbearable in your eyes?

30
00:01:10.366 --> 00:01:12.433
You have to argue with me in front of the children

31
00:01:12.433 --> 00:01:15.366
If our family hadn't saved you, you would have died long ago

32
00:01:15.366 --> 00:01:18.500
You live like a dog

33
00:01:19.166 --> 00:01:22.266
Joke, Mom and Dad, don't quarrel, okay?

34
00:01:22.266 --> 00:01:23.466
I was scared.

35
00:01:24.866 --> 00:01:27.666
What are you doing like your trash?

36
00:01:27.666 --> 00:01:29.066
You want to hit me?

37
00:01:29.166 --> 00:01:33.166
The wings are hard, you come and go, call here, stop
