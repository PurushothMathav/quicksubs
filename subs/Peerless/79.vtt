00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:04.000
Hahahahaha you

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.033
It's the temple owner

3
00:00:06.033 --> 00:00:07.566
You are the temple owner

4
00:00:07.733 --> 00:00:10.466
Then how dare I compete with you for the position of head of the Ye family?

5
00:00:10.466 --> 00:00:12.133
I still dare to rob you of this big fight

6
00:00:12.133 --> 00:00:13.533
President of the Chamber of Commerce?

7
00:00:13.533 --> 00:00:15.233
You think I'm stupid

8
00:00:15.266 --> 00:00:17.833
Are you smart, fool?

9
00:00:18.333 --> 00:00:20.600
It seems that you are really messing up today.

10
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.433
You don't think I would believe that

11
00:00:22.433 --> 00:00:23.733
Lord Shopkeeper

12
00:00:23.733 --> 00:00:25.400
It's your little head king.

13
00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.966
Yes, this child's mentality is twisted

14
00:00:28.033 --> 00:00:30.266
It's exactly the virtue of a poor man

15
00:00:30.266 --> 00:00:32.466
But you came to the wrong place

16
00:00:32.466 --> 00:00:34.066
This is the Supreme Hall

17
00:00:34.066 --> 00:00:36.400
It is the place where the temple is consecrated and worshiped

18
00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.300
How many heads have you come here to make trouble?

19
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.800
The six commanders are about to enter

20
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.500
Gotta get rid of this kid first

21
00:00:42.666 --> 00:00:44.900
Otherwise, we will be responsible.

22
00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:47.266
If I can't handle this little thing well

23
00:00:47.266 --> 00:00:49.433
I'm afraid it will really affect the temple

24
00:00:49.433 --> 00:00:51.966
Impressions of our Hero Chamber of Commerce

25
00:00:57.066 --> 00:00:57.933
Break me up

26
00:00:58.233 --> 00:01:00.100
Grass kill yourself

27
00:01:00.333 --> 00:01:03.666
Maybe I can spare a woman by your side

28
00:01:03.666 --> 00:01:05.333
A cheap life

29
00:01:05.466 --> 00:01:07.100
Summer worms are not compatible with ice

30
00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.833
No matter how the loach in the pond struggles

31
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.500
It's hard after all

32
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.400
My sword is as fast as lightning

33
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.700
No one in the world has escaped this trick and died
