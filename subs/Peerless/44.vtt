00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:01.333
You're late.

2
00:00:01.333 --> 00:00:03.666
Have you ever seen a big shot who is not late?

3
00:00:04.133 --> 00:00:04.933
robbery

4
00:00:05.533 --> 00:00:06.333
Say

5
00:00:07.066 --> 00:00:09.133
Guys, I'm here

6
00:00:09.133 --> 00:00:10.600
What's the matter?

7
00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:12.366
Come at me

8
00:00:14.433 --> 00:00:15.533
outrageous

9
00:00:15.533 --> 00:00:19.233
Boy, did you just curse the night market?

10
00:00:19.233 --> 00:00:22.233
No, I'm just telling the truth.

11
00:00:22.466 --> 00:00:24.866
Now I'm the heir to the Night Market Group

12
00:00:25.266 --> 00:00:27.433
Please speak to me politely

13
00:00:27.566 --> 00:00:30.000
And I just got on the job.

14
00:00:30.233 --> 00:00:32.566
Please give me your numbers.

15
00:00:32.566 --> 00:00:33.966
I want to meet you all.

16
00:00:33.966 --> 00:00:38.233
Hahahahaha oops

17
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:39.900
It's ridiculous

18
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:40.866
Take a look.

19
00:00:40.866 --> 00:00:42.933
And that is ignorance.

20
00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.233
Ye Tianci, I respect you

21
00:00:45.233 --> 00:00:46.833
I call you big brother

22
00:00:46.833 --> 00:00:49.533
But I also want to remind you that today

23
00:00:49.533 --> 00:00:52.566
But the highest-ranking board of directors of the night market group

24
00:00:52.566 --> 00:00:55.633
All of you here are shareholders of the group

25
00:00:55.666 --> 00:00:58.333
Everybody's worth a trillion dollars.

26
00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:59.866
Even Weixiong speaks

27
00:00:59.866 --> 00:01:01.666
Wouldn't use such a light tone

28
00:01:01.666 --> 00:01:03.433
Do you feel like becoming the president?

29
00:01:03.533 --> 00:01:05.166
You can do whatever you want

30
00:01:05.666 --> 00:01:06.766
Isn't it?

31
00:01:06.766 --> 00:01:09.200
Boy, I'll tell you

32
00:01:09.233 --> 00:01:11.300
This CEO is not an easy job

33
00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:12.766
Any opinions or ideas

34
00:01:12.766 --> 00:01:14.433
Have to go through our board of directors

35
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.933
Which one of you is not deeply rooted?

36
00:01:17.933 --> 00:01:19.800
Does not represent a bride price

37
00:01:19.933 --> 00:01:22.000
Instead, a little security guard like you

38
00:01:22.333 --> 00:01:24.566
Very rude

39
00:01:27.333 --> 00:01:28.533
What about me?

40
00:01:28.833 --> 00:01:29.933
Used to be rude

41
00:01:29.933 --> 00:01:32.000
I can't stand it

42
00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:34.200
If you can't stand it, you'll get used to it.
