00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:01.233
What's going on?

2
00:00:01.433 --> 00:00:02.866
How could it go up so fast?

3
00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:05.400
Night market group wealth has broken through 4 trillion

4
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:06.533
50,000 wait

5
00:00:06.533 --> 00:00:07.733
60,000 no no no

6
00:00:07.733 --> 00:00:09.533
It's too fast, it's too late to report

7
00:00:09.533 --> 00:00:11.133
It's only been a few minutes.

8
00:00:11.833 --> 00:00:13.000
Assets of Night Market

9
00:00:13.033 --> 00:00:16.033
The market value has entered the top ten in the world

10
00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:17.900
Top nine top eight

11
00:00:18.133 --> 00:00:19.500
Too fast, too fast.

12
00:00:19.533 --> 00:00:22.233
I can't keep up with his ascent

13
00:00:22.233 --> 00:00:24.033
This is inhumane.

14
00:00:24.033 --> 00:00:26.166
This is inhumane

15
00:00:26.166 --> 00:00:27.433
This is a miserable soul

16
00:00:27.433 --> 00:00:28.933
That's unreasonable!

17
00:00:28.933 --> 00:00:30.800
And just now, I was ignoring him.

18
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.200
It's turning against the wind now

19
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.833
This is not a turnaround.

20
00:00:35.366 --> 00:00:36.533
It's called the power room.

21
00:00:36.766 --> 00:00:38.333
I told you before.

22
00:00:38.333 --> 00:00:42.233
Within 5 minutes, the night market group skyrocketed a hundredfold

23
00:00:42.966 --> 00:00:43.800
Now.

24
00:00:45.566 --> 00:00:47.033
Five minutes is up.

25
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.500
Owner, you really did it.

26
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:50.600
Just one sentence.

27
00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.200
Let the world capital pour in like crazy

28
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.333
Funding the night market

29
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.000
I have been running night markets for so many years

30
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.233
It's the first time I've seen it.

31
00:00:56.333 --> 00:00:58.900
It really opened my eyes, the so-called capital

32
00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:00.866
It's just a numbers party.

33
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:02.466
Only true interpretation

34
00:01:02.833 --> 00:01:04.800
Only a daughter doesn't change four a day

35
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:05.666
Really successful

36
00:01:06.033 --> 00:01:07.733
I still want to take one day and four days a year

37
00:01:07.733 --> 00:01:09.100
What about the five-time group?

38
00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:10.866
Oops Ye Rulong

39
00:01:11.533 --> 00:01:13.500
Zhang Beifeng has happened so far

40
00:01:13.733 --> 00:01:16.500
What else do you two have to say?
