00:00:00.466 --> 00:00:02.300
This speed

2
00:00:02.366 --> 00:00:04.466
This -- this is a rocket soaring.

3
00:00:04.466 --> 00:00:05.700
Oh, my God.

4
00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.233
Top 100 in the world.

5
00:00:07.233 --> 00:00:08.866
This is impossible.

6
00:00:08.866 --> 00:00:12.533
It has rescued the top ten and five in the world.

7
00:00:12.633 --> 00:00:16.700
Total final wealth 3,500

8
00:00:18.266 --> 00:00:20.066
Becoming the second largest in the world

9
00:00:20.266 --> 00:00:22.000
The number one place in the world is

10
00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.900
A temple of unrivaled power

11
00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.800
Why is the temple so familiar?

12
00:00:28.433 --> 00:00:30.300
Are you the owner of the temple?

13
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:32.600
The man named Skylark

14
00:00:32.833 --> 00:00:35.300
Doesn't that mean I'm the owner of the temple shop?

15
00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:36.900
Now.

16
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.466
You should know the strength of my richest family, right?

17
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:42.866
Look at the dragon

18
00:00:43.466 --> 00:00:45.500
The global financial rankings have been refreshed

19
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.000
The second place is

20
00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:48.266
It's Ye Tianci

21
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.266
Who is Ye Tianci?

22
00:00:51.266 --> 00:00:53.466
Never heard of it, oops, you're stupid.

23
00:00:53.466 --> 00:00:54.700
Your dead daddy

24
00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:56.466
Found their long-lost son

25
00:00:56.466 --> 00:00:58.733
The name is said to be Ye Tianci

26
00:00:59.066 --> 00:01:01.400
What do you mean?

27
00:01:01.666 --> 00:01:04.500
Ye Tiansi, this kid has inherited Ye

28
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.166
All the assets of the house

29
00:01:06.166 --> 00:01:08.266
And in the end

30
00:01:08.266 --> 00:01:09.733
He is still the eldest son

31
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.100
The Ye family is inherited by the eldest son

32
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.733
What can we do?

33
00:01:13.766 --> 00:01:16.700
What should I do?

34
00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:17.866
Do you think I have been so many years?

35
00:01:17.866 --> 00:01:19.700
Are you not prepared at all?

36
00:01:20.033 --> 00:01:21.400
My good big brother

37
00:01:21.566 --> 00:01:22.766
Wait a day

38
00:01:22.766 --> 00:01:25.200
I've been waiting a long time.

39
00:01:25.433 --> 00:01:28.933
Incoming plane to southern Xinjiang
