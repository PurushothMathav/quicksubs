00:00:00.466 --> 00:00:01.500
Just kidding

2
00:00:01.633 --> 00:00:02.966
And who are you?

3
00:00:02.966 --> 00:00:05.400
Is there such a thing as Mr. Zhang?

4
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.866
My Zhang family is the fifth of the Building Chamber of Commerce

5
00:00:07.866 --> 00:00:09.466
One of the vice presidents

6
00:00:09.566 --> 00:00:12.933
Why haven't I heard of this?

7
00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:15.600
I think he's crazy

8
00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:16.466
Still immersed

9
00:00:16.466 --> 00:00:19.466
In your dream of being a temple owner?

10
00:00:19.466 --> 00:00:22.200
Did you forget that you are just a small security guard?

11
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:23.133
All right.

12
00:00:23.866 --> 00:00:26.300
Stop arguing, Brother Ru

13
00:00:27.666 --> 00:00:29.866
The young master signed this letter of appointment

14
00:00:29.866 --> 00:00:32.600
You are the real head of the night market group

15
00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.466
Dad, are you so biased?

16
00:00:35.466 --> 00:00:38.366
Don't even give me a chance to compete fairly?

17
00:00:38.366 --> 00:00:39.666
It doesn't matter fair

18
00:00:39.833 --> 00:00:42.566
I value people more

19
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.266
Old master, it's hard for you to bear the weight like this.

20
00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.866
I, Ye Weixiong, guarantee such a big foundation

21
00:00:49.866 --> 00:00:53.100
Could it be that you are still being influenced by the directors?

22
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:54.833
Sign you sign

23
00:00:54.833 --> 00:00:56.066
I'll see who dares to disagree

24
00:00:56.566 --> 00:00:57.866
Sign it now

25
00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:59.333
While the root has the voice over

26
00:01:03.766 --> 00:01:04.566
Ye Guolong

27
00:01:05.233 --> 00:01:07.766
This is what you've been dreaming of, right?

28
00:01:07.766 --> 00:01:10.433
Ye Tianci, do you dare to talk to me?

29
00:01:10.433 --> 00:01:12.733
Come to a real rescue

30
00:01:13.366 --> 00:01:14.666
Don't listen to him

31
00:01:14.666 --> 00:01:16.700
You have no roots in the imperial capital, duckweed

32
00:01:16.866 --> 00:01:18.666
There is nothing equal between you

33
00:01:30.366 --> 00:01:32.333
Master you a thousand times

34
00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.633
He is like a dragon, I learn

35
00:01:35.633 --> 00:01:38.266
A room full of directors just trying to force me to open the door

36
00:01:38.433 --> 00:01:39.866
Even with this contract

37
00:01:40.266 --> 00:01:41.800
They won't be happy either

38
00:01:41.833 --> 00:01:42.900
My good brother

39
00:01:43.066 --> 00:01:44.600
I'll tear him apart for you.

40
00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.200
But I'll put it there.

41
00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.900
Even without this solution

42
00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.733
You are not qualified to compete with me even if you leap like a dragon
