00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:01.800
God damn it

2
00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:03.766
He's all mine.

3
00:00:03.766 --> 00:00:05.566
When I get the big Xiamen

4
00:00:05.566 --> 00:00:08.500
Go and wish Lord Mora to kill the temple

5
00:00:08.566 --> 00:00:11.033
See the top two global powers

6
00:00:11.033 --> 00:00:13.766
It's all in my bag, Yan Rulong

7
00:00:13.766 --> 00:00:16.000
Just because you are right

8
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.266
Just by you

9
00:00:18.333 --> 00:00:21.200
I really don't believe that a security guard can have

10
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:22.800
This magical sword

11
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.700
How about I be your master in the future?

12
00:00:25.933 --> 00:00:28.800
Courting death, Da Xialong has been since his birth

13
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.333
I have been following the owner's southern expedition and northern battle

14
00:00:31.333 --> 00:00:32.766
Already formed Lexus

15
00:00:32.766 --> 00:00:34.233
Only the owner is recognized.

16
00:00:34.333 --> 00:00:37.933
Anyone who unleashes poison and draws a sword will only be killed by his Blade and Soul

17
00:00:38.133 --> 00:00:39.500
A little careless

18
00:00:39.633 --> 00:00:41.000
Life is not guaranteed

19
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.266
No bones

20
00:00:42.433 --> 00:00:43.700
Scare the book

21
00:00:43.766 --> 00:00:45.966
Do you think it was supposed to scare the big one?

22
00:00:45.966 --> 00:00:47.500
Just a sword

23
00:00:47.566 --> 00:00:48.466
It's condensed.

24
00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:50.400
That's it.

25
00:00:53.533 --> 00:00:54.800
Hahahaha

26
00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.266
I'm fine.

27
00:00:56.533 --> 00:01:00.200
It seems that the real Dragon Emperor is me

28
00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:04.600
As the owner of Moro, you and I will do it together

29
00:01:04.733 --> 00:01:06.533
Hahahaha

30
00:01:13.566 --> 00:01:14.633
Monk dragon go

31
00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:17.633
What's going on?

32
00:01:17.633 --> 00:01:18.866
Will that be all?

33
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.733
The owner also asks you to draw your sword

34
00:01:22.733 --> 00:01:24.366
The temple has long been unfamiliar

35
00:01:24.366 --> 00:01:27.200
Please return to your place ASAP and regroup.

36
00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:29.966
No, you're not.

37
00:01:29.966 --> 00:01:32.200
The salesperson just pulls out a trace of pathology suffering from symptoms

38
00:01:32.533 --> 00:01:34.166
Not if you go again

39
00:01:34.166 --> 00:01:35.566
He is the owner of the temple shop

40
00:01:35.566 --> 00:01:37.866
Even if you draw the sword, there will be no problem.

41
00:01:38.433 --> 00:01:39.833
Ask the owner to draw his sword

42
00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.600
Ask the shopkeeper to draw his sword
