00:00:03.433 --> 00:00:05.666
Ye Shao won't treat me badly.

3
00:00:06.866 --> 00:00:08.966
Think of me as the president of the beautiful woman in southern Xinjiang

4
00:00:08.966 --> 00:00:10.666
To be reduced to being a cleaner

5
00:00:11.066 --> 00:00:12.666
Did I really do something wrong?

6
00:00:12.666 --> 00:00:14.566
