00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:01.400
What beast?

2
00:00:01.933 --> 00:00:03.266
Did you just admit defeat?

3
00:00:03.266 --> 00:00:05.400
You were bullied so miserably by Ye Tianci

4
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.400
Don't you want to step on him?

5
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.800
Of course I want him

6
00:00:09.933 --> 00:00:11.000
What else could he do?

7
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.100
Can I help you?

8
00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:15.966
I can help Ye Tianci step back into the soil

9
00:00:15.966 --> 00:00:18.133
Then I will lift you up to the sky

10
00:00:18.133 --> 00:00:19.033
After

11
00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.566
When he was on his knees begging you

12
00:00:22.566 --> 00:00:23.900
Nine Heavens Above

13
00:00:24.166 --> 00:00:27.666
What do you mean by recruiting? I mean

14
00:00:27.733 --> 00:00:30.000
The president of the Great Xia Chamber of Commerce

15
00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:31.433
I use you to do it

16
00:00:32.066 --> 00:00:33.966
I will be the president

17
00:00:34.466 --> 00:00:36.300
Really? Zhang Beifeng?

18
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.400
How dare you!

19
00:00:38.533 --> 00:00:40.966
When will the president of the Great Xia Chamber of Commerce

20
00:00:41.133 --> 00:00:43.500
Can you assign it?

21
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:44.300
Don't fool around

22
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.466
How about money? That's a temple

23
00:00:46.466 --> 00:00:47.733
Taken from the assigned building

24
00:00:47.733 --> 00:00:48.733
Last time we fought

25
00:00:48.733 --> 00:00:51.100
And the six commanders are right outside the door

26
00:00:51.333 --> 00:00:52.933
How can you assign it privately?

27
00:00:52.933 --> 00:00:57.000
Don't retreat, even China doesn't have this right.

28
00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.000
You don't have it.

29
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.233
But I don't care, there's always something added together, right?

30
00:01:01.266 --> 00:01:03.666
Do you really think

31
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.300
Qi Luge is qualified to sit in the position of president

32
00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:08.866
If even he had

33
00:01:09.133 --> 00:01:11.200
Why can't Chu Ruoxi

34
00:01:12.166 --> 00:01:14.866
Qin Ruge was elected as the president of the Great Xia Chamber of Commerce

35
00:01:14.866 --> 00:01:16.600
Unexpected indeed

36
00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.533
Yes, I originally thought it was Ye Rulong Ye Shao

37
00:01:19.533 --> 00:01:21.933
But who knew that it was written with Qin Ruge's name?

38
00:01:21.933 --> 00:01:23.166
Just two words away

39
00:01:23.166 --> 00:01:25.666
The problem lies in these two words

40
00:01:25.666 --> 00:01:26.466
Four a day

41
00:01:26.466 --> 00:01:29.766
You have nothing to explain to everyone
