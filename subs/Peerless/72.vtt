00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:04.733
It's time for the building chamber of commerce election to officially start

2
00:00:04.733 --> 00:00:07.066
Please enter the real manager

3
00:00:19.333 --> 00:00:20.733
Ah, you're finally here.

4
00:00:20.733 --> 00:00:22.800
I'm going to welcome the six commanders in

5
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.400
They are also waiting at the door

6
00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.500
Don't wait for the circuit army to call

7
00:00:26.833 --> 00:00:27.800
What's next?

8
00:00:27.933 --> 00:00:29.966
The five directors of our Daxia Chamber of Commerce

9
00:00:29.966 --> 00:00:32.300
About to announce the human rights of my new president

10
00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:35.300
Hahaha, mom, wait a minute, what's the matter?

11
00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:36.600
This Ye Tianci

12
00:00:36.633 --> 00:00:39.000
He's been messing around since he entered the venue

13
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.700
Seriously disrupt the order of the venue

14
00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:41.900
His heart can be punished

15
00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:45.133
I suggest that this person be cleared of me immediately

16
00:00:45.166 --> 00:00:47.666
Ah, you're right.

17
00:00:47.966 --> 00:00:50.666
It's just me, stop fooling around

18
00:00:51.366 --> 00:00:52.800
This person has the dragon body

19
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:53.700
Is a VIP

20
00:00:53.733 --> 00:00:54.866
Can't make this

21
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.700
Mr. Zhang, his VIP identity may be forged

22
00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:00.500
We were all deceived by him just now.

23
00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.000
Let his conspiracy succeed

24
00:01:02.333 --> 00:01:05.366
The upcoming presidential election is a top priority

25
00:01:05.366 --> 00:01:06.433
I have been elected

26
00:01:06.433 --> 00:01:09.733
I have the right to expel the dead

27
00:01:09.733 --> 00:01:10.800
You are elected

28
00:01:11.933 --> 00:01:13.600
Who said that, Mr. Zhang?

29
00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.200
Don't be kidding

30
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.066
We all know that.

31
00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.900
Hahaha, you got it.

32
00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:21.300
I never knew

33
00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:22.900
How do you know that?

34
00:01:22.933 --> 00:01:25.400
Dad, don't give a shit

35
00:01:25.533 --> 00:01:27.100
This is about Ye Shao being elected president

36
00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:28.333
It's about DingTalk on the board

37
00:01:28.333 --> 00:01:29.900
We have all confirmed it.

38
00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:33.500
So that's why you offend the VIPs
