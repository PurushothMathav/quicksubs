1
00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.533
I accept

2
00:00:03.433 --> 00:00:04.600
Mr. Qin

3
00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:09.166
The recipient you mentioned cannot be the son of the richest man in the building, right?

4
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.700
How is that possible?

5
00:00:12.166 --> 00:00:14.600
Mr. Qin, he is a stinky security guard

6
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.633
How could it be the son of everyone's protection?

7
00:00:16.633 --> 00:00:20.100
What do you think on such a grand occasion today?

8
00:00:20.166 --> 00:00:21.766
Would I just pick the wrong person?

9
00:00:21.766 --> 00:00:23.033
Even if he admits he is wrong

10
00:00:23.033 --> 00:00:24.100
I, Ye Weixiong

11
00:00:24.566 --> 00:00:26.433
You can't be wrong.

12
00:00:26.433 --> 00:00:27.666
Ye Weixiong

13
00:00:28.433 --> 00:00:30.100
Does that sound familiar to you?

14
00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:34.533
You are the richest man

15
00:00:36.033 --> 00:00:39.133
What building's richest man has been in the banquet hall

16
00:00:39.433 --> 00:00:42.966
When my wife picked up the temple before that

17
00:00:43.166 --> 00:00:44.766
I can see it clearly

18
00:00:44.766 --> 00:00:47.500
Oh, what can we do about that?

19
00:00:47.566 --> 00:00:50.400
We bully the son of the richest man in Great Xia like this

20
00:00:50.566 --> 00:00:53.366
Our house is over

21
00:00:55.766 --> 00:00:57.833
President Qin, Guardian Ye

22
00:00:57.833 --> 00:01:00.233
Since you are sure that he is the heir of the Ye family

23
00:01:00.233 --> 00:01:01.766
Always check it out

24
00:01:01.766 --> 00:01:03.066
Make no mistake.

25
00:01:03.066 --> 00:01:04.433
I don't mean anything else.

26
00:01:04.433 --> 00:01:05.900
I am also thinking of the Ye family

27
00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.766
Well, it's not your turn to point fingers

28
00:01:08.766 --> 00:01:10.500
We will naturally verify

29
00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.866
Iron thorn, put your pendant

30
00:01:13.766 --> 00:01:15.766
What pendant do you take out?

31
00:01:16.666 --> 00:01:17.600
What are you doing?

32
00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.266
If you want to take it, hurry up and take it out. Come on

33
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.966
Does this match?

34
00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.100
No.

35
00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.166
I, the richest man in Jiangmen, have a family jade pendant

36
00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.100
It is ancient blood jade

37
00:01:34.366 --> 00:01:36.100
Only blood drop verification

38
00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:38.333
How to verify that it is the blood of the Short Leaf family?

39
00:01:38.566 --> 00:01:41.566
Ye Shoufu, this jade pendant can be replaced.

40
00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:43.400
No one took the jade pendant.

41
00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:44.933
Who is your son?

42
00:01:47.966 --> 00:01:48.766
insist
