00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.500
My evaluation of you

2
00:00:01.866 --> 00:00:03.533
A little colder

3
00:00:03.533 --> 00:00:05.200
You are such an idiot.

4
00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:08.300
Do you know the weight of this appointment letter?

5
00:00:08.533 --> 00:00:10.666
The head of Ye's hometown has worked hard

6
00:00:10.666 --> 00:00:12.166
The shareholders of our board of directors

7
00:00:12.166 --> 00:00:14.300
He reluctantly came to this board

8
00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:15.866
As a result, you tore it up like this.

9
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:17.866
It all came to nothing

10
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.600
Now you can start the election again.

11
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.200
But I have a word of caution here.

12
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.200
If you choose the wrong person

13
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.200
Causing the skeleton in his hand to fall sharply

14
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.566
You have to bear the consequences.

15
00:00:28.733 --> 00:00:30.500
I said my good brother

16
00:00:30.533 --> 00:00:32.800
Why do you always like to talk nonsense?

17
00:00:32.966 --> 00:00:34.533
You are just a mother's love

18
00:00:34.533 --> 00:00:37.400
Can it still affect the share price of a listed company?

19
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.166
If you can do it

20
00:00:39.166 --> 00:00:41.500
I give up

21
00:00:42.733 --> 00:00:44.233
Godfather

22
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.433
God send you say you

23
00:00:47.766 --> 00:00:49.800
Too much child's play

24
00:00:49.966 --> 00:00:50.866
Never mind.

25
00:00:50.933 --> 00:00:53.900
Now I can only follow the normal procedure.

26
00:00:53.933 --> 00:00:56.800
Please vote in favor of Ye Tianci

27
00:01:02.966 --> 00:01:05.633
Brother Xinru is on the ticket?

28
00:01:06.866 --> 00:01:09.333
Support Ye Tianci's election as chairperson of Night Audit Group

29
00:01:09.333 --> 00:01:10.300
number of votes

30
00:01:11.166 --> 00:01:13.566
0 votes hahaha

31
00:01:14.666 --> 00:01:15.600
I said yes big brother

32
00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.633
I really don't know how to thank you.

33
00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.300
Such a night market group reserves your place

34
00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:24.000
Do you still use your old job as a little security guard?

35
00:01:24.133 --> 00:01:28.866
Hahahahaha

36
00:01:29.766 --> 00:01:30.566
Ah!

37
00:01:30.866 --> 00:01:31.666
Ah!

38
00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.100
Brother, you lost the election, what are you laughing at?

39
00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:37.100
I'm laughing.

40
00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.066
Up until now you didn't know your opponent

41
00:01:40.466 --> 00:01:41.633
How powerful is it?
