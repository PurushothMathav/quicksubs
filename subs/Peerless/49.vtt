00:00:01.533 --> 00:00:03.266
Zhang Xiao, what's wrong?

2
00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:05.866
Our Zhang family's stock in your night market group

3
00:00:05.866 --> 00:00:07.300
All were acquired

4
00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:09.200
And they are all sniper spikes.

5
00:00:09.333 --> 00:00:11.233
All bought at the lowest price

6
00:00:14.433 --> 00:00:15.500
How is that possible?

7
00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:16.766
In such a short time

8
00:00:16.766 --> 00:00:18.400
How did he manage it?

9
00:00:22.066 --> 00:00:23.233
From now on

10
00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:26.633
Night Market Group Official Glass Drum with Zhang Family

11
00:00:26.633 --> 00:00:28.566
Zhang Shao from now on

12
00:00:28.566 --> 00:00:31.666
You have nothing to do with the night market group

13
00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:33.666
The door is over there please

14
00:00:34.166 --> 00:00:35.133
How could this be?

15
00:00:35.133 --> 00:00:36.133
That's impossible.

16
00:00:36.133 --> 00:00:37.433
How do you manage it?

17
00:00:37.433 --> 00:00:39.366
The stock ownership ratio of my Zhang family's printing bet is

18
00:00:39.366 --> 00:00:42.733
I killed all 2 billion

19
00:00:42.733 --> 00:00:44.433
What right do you have to ask me?

20
00:00:44.433 --> 00:00:47.366
I say one last time, get out

21
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.733
Ok ok you wait for me

22
00:00:52.566 --> 00:00:53.366
Zhang Sheng

23
00:00:57.766 --> 00:00:58.666
Pardon me?

24
00:00:58.866 --> 00:00:59.866
Been shorted

25
00:00:59.866 --> 00:01:01.600
What about night market stocks?

26
00:01:02.133 --> 00:01:03.400
It's all gone.

27
00:01:03.566 --> 00:01:06.566
The door is over there please

28
00:01:08.333 --> 00:01:11.066
I didn't expect one-night work for more than ten years

29
00:01:11.066 --> 00:01:12.833
As it turned out today

30
00:01:13.066 --> 00:01:16.333
Mr. Ye shouldn't be operating behind your back, right?

31
00:01:16.333 --> 00:01:17.366
Even me

32
00:01:17.366 --> 00:01:20.433
Do you think I can do it in such a short time?

33
00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:21.433
Who is it?

34
00:01:22.933 --> 00:01:23.833
Hey

35
00:01:41.266 --> 00:01:42.066
Do not come

36
00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:43.733
Here we go.

37
00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:45.466
It's your turn.
