00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:02.600
Is this the attitude of your Great Xia Chamber of Commerce?

2
00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:04.566
I'm asking you. I'm asking you.

3
00:00:04.566 --> 00:00:07.233
Is this the attitude of the Great Xia Chamber of Commerce?

4
00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:10.166
Has the temple of the presidency been revealed?

5
00:00:10.166 --> 00:00:11.366
You have to go back

6
00:00:11.366 --> 00:00:15.466
I just want a consultant yes or fuck no yes

7
00:00:15.666 --> 00:00:16.766
We're going back on it.

8
00:00:16.766 --> 00:00:18.066
What happened to the new president?

9
00:00:18.066 --> 00:00:19.200
You little stinky security guard

10
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.900
What do you really think you are capable of?

11
00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.566
Ye Tianci, you have used all the wrong means

12
00:00:23.566 --> 00:00:25.366
Stole my chairpersonship

13
00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:26.966
When the six commanders arrived

14
00:00:26.966 --> 00:00:28.866
I see how you end up

15
00:00:29.133 --> 00:00:30.900
President of the Chamber of Commerce in this building

16
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.733
It was originally given to my brother.

17
00:00:32.733 --> 00:00:33.800
No one can take it away

18
00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.966
I can't accept it, I can't hold it in my anger, I can't bear it.

19
00:00:37.133 --> 00:00:40.600
Or I'll make you die one by one ugly

20
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.433
Hahaha you this time

21
00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:43.366
I am in charge of the Sixth Major

22
00:00:43.366 --> 00:00:44.166
Since admission

23
00:00:44.166 --> 00:00:47.100
You never showed me the respect to count the doors in the venue

24
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.000
Six people maximum

25
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.400
Where did you get the confidence?

26
00:00:49.466 --> 00:00:51.466
100% superior posture

27
00:00:51.466 --> 00:00:53.066
I was already superior

28
00:00:53.066 --> 00:00:54.066
Why gesture

29
00:00:54.066 --> 00:00:56.433
And today's chairpersonship

30
00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:57.766
You are like a dragon

31
00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:58.933
Can't sit

32
00:00:58.933 --> 00:01:01.933
Even with the support of the six managers, it is useless

33
00:01:01.933 --> 00:01:03.500
Who do you think you are?

34
00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.800
Then I'll tell you who I am

35
00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.200
I am the owner of the temple
