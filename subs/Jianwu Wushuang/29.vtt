00:00:00.566 --> 00:00:03.766
Hey, fortunately, it wasn't me who married you in the first place.

2
00:00:03.766 --> 00:00:04.800
Why not?

3
00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:07.366
It's me who suffers now

4
00:00:07.766 --> 00:00:09.800
Grandpa, who is he?

5
00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:11.466
Why did you bring him home?

6
00:00:11.466 --> 00:00:15.066
He is the future patron saint of our Jiang family

7
00:00:15.066 --> 00:00:16.800
Also one of you two

8
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.900
Future husband hey

9
00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:20.500
What husband?

10
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.066
Dressed in rags

11
00:00:22.066 --> 00:00:23.066
Another fool

12
00:00:23.066 --> 00:00:25.866
I also want to study abroad and have a great future

13
00:00:25.866 --> 00:00:27.300
Don't marry him

14
00:00:27.566 --> 00:00:29.366
Yuxin, how about you?

15
00:00:29.366 --> 00:00:31.900
Say you don't want to, don't force it

16
00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:34.600
Just pretend that our Jiang family does not have this iron.

17
00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.433
Howard Johnson takes care of his grandfather

18
00:00:40.066 --> 00:00:42.833
I am willing to Qianlong Zaiyuan

19
00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.466
The broken corpse will eventually roar in the world one day

20
00:00:47.466 --> 00:00:50.166
So you are lucky.

21
00:00:50.166 --> 00:00:52.166
How can I marry this fool?

22
00:00:52.166 --> 00:00:53.100
Regret it

23
00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.966
He will only be your drag bottle for life

24
00:00:55.966 --> 00:00:57.066
You are not allowed to say that

25
00:00:57.066 --> 00:00:58.666
Haoran has never dragged me down

26
00:00:58.666 --> 00:01:00.300
The luckiest thing in my life

27
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.633
Is to marry him

28
00:01:01.866 --> 00:01:04.600
Hahaha, don't make me laugh.

29
00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:05.466
how

30
00:01:05.466 --> 00:01:08.233
It's all about feelings with this fool, right?

31
00:01:08.366 --> 00:01:11.000
Ah, is this fool bigger?

32
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.300
Are you satisfied?

33
00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:13.900
What are you?

34
00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:15.866
Don't put gold on your face

35
00:01:15.866 --> 00:01:17.266
What innocence are you pretending to have here?

36
00:01:17.266 --> 00:01:20.800
You come to the Emgrand Hotel dressed like this and make fun of yourself

37
00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.133
Have a sister like you

38
00:01:22.133 --> 00:01:23.733
I'm humiliated by you

39
00:01:23.733 --> 00:01:27.233
Shut up and warn you if you talk nonsense again

40
00:01:27.266 --> 00:01:29.700
I'll slap your mouth and roll
