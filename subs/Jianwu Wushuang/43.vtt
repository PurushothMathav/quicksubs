00:00:00.533 --> 00:00:01.466
Ma Haoran

2
00:00:01.466 --> 00:00:03.300
Is that you, go away

3
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:04.900
This is the trap he set

4
00:00:05.266 --> 00:00:06.066
Mom

5
00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:07.566
Anyway.

6
00:00:07.566 --> 00:00:10.500
My son will definitely teach you to see my son today

7
00:00:11.166 --> 00:00:12.500
Why don't you kneel?

8
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:13.600
Humph

9
00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:15.133
Why kneel

10
00:00:15.133 --> 00:00:17.366
Bold you traitor

11
00:00:17.366 --> 00:00:20.366
It's enough to see His Highness the Prince die and repent

12
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:21.800
And you talk about it.

13
00:00:22.066 --> 00:00:24.266
You three cast spells for sin

14
00:00:24.366 --> 00:00:25.766
It's a rebellion

15
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.566
Convicted sin

16
00:00:27.566 --> 00:00:30.333
What else does His Royal Highness the Lion have to say to such a rebel?

17
00:00:30.333 --> 00:00:32.066
Just take them down for the interview

18
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:33.266
The lion is here

19
00:00:33.266 --> 00:00:34.333
How dare you come?

20
00:00:34.333 --> 00:00:35.133
You're courting death.

21
00:00:35.133 --> 00:00:35.933
Luo Shaofeng

22
00:00:36.566 --> 00:00:39.666
The two generals wonder if they can remember our party

23
00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:41.466
Back then, you forced our Jiangnan net worth

24
00:00:41.466 --> 00:00:42.800
Surrender of property

25
00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.366
We remember it vividly

26
00:00:44.366 --> 00:00:48.400
It really is the blood of a traitor, and it has no brains at all.

27
00:00:48.666 --> 00:00:49.866
Just your skills

28
00:00:49.866 --> 00:00:51.900
Can you go out this day?

29
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.100
overreach

30
00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.366
I, Yunshi, guarded the building for a hundred years

31
00:00:55.466 --> 00:00:56.466
Generational loyalty

32
00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.866
When is the greedy Taoist priest

33
00:00:59.266 --> 00:01:02.800
It's the Ghost King, no matter what I say in Lin's mouth

34
00:01:03.266 --> 00:01:05.266
Lin's treason and rebellion

35
00:01:05.933 --> 00:01:08.533
Zhenbei Royal Mansion acts for heaven

36
00:01:08.533 --> 00:01:10.233
Kill them all

37
00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.633
You're just a fish that slipped through the net

38
00:01:12.766 --> 00:01:14.600
No. Find a place to hide

39
00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.100
How dare you speak nonsense here

40
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.800
You say I'm here to betray my country

41
00:01:19.166 --> 00:01:20.766
A little sin curse

42
00:01:20.933 --> 00:01:22.166
Dare to quibble

43
00:01:22.533 --> 00:01:26.700
My family adopted you because you were pitiful

44
00:01:26.733 --> 00:01:28.800
I didn't expect you to pretend to be crazy

45
00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:30.866
The two generals who killed our northern king

46
00:01:30.866 --> 00:01:32.600
What is not treason

47
00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.300
I am your mother-in-law

48
00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:36.000
Am I still going to lie?
