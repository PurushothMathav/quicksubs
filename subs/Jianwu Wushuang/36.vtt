00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.100
What's wrong, Haoran?

2
00:00:06.566 --> 00:00:10.366
I'm afraid the king of the town is the existence at the top of the building

3
00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:12.166
Fair hand to help him

4
00:00:12.366 --> 00:00:14.066
No match for him at all

5
00:00:14.166 --> 00:00:15.600
Just a word from him

6
00:00:15.766 --> 00:00:17.866
There are countless people who will do anything at all costs

7
00:00:17.866 --> 00:00:19.266
Come to Jiangnan and kill me

8
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:23.266
Don't worry, since the day I woke up

9
00:00:23.533 --> 00:00:25.600
Your ending is already doomed

10
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.466
My death in the north is already a kind of suffering

11
00:00:29.066 --> 00:00:30.700
But he's all monstrous

12
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.700
The most powerful man in the world again

13
00:00:32.766 --> 00:00:34.433
We can't beat him at all

14
00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:36.300
Why don't we run away

15
00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.666
To a place where no one knows us

16
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.066
Live a reclusive life

17
00:00:40.066 --> 00:00:42.500
Fool, you have no confidence in me

18
00:00:42.666 --> 00:00:43.500
Don't worry.

19
00:00:43.933 --> 00:00:46.600
My background is not as simple as you think

20
00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:47.666
I promise you.

21
00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:49.766
Wait until all these things are gone

22
00:00:49.766 --> 00:00:52.466
I'll take you to the mundane life you want

23
00:00:52.666 --> 00:00:55.300
Okay? Can it really be solved?

24
00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.366
Really? You believe me?

25
00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:58.700
Give me a little more time.

26
00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.866
As long as I solve these time

27
00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:04.166
Haven't you always wanted a flower shop?

28
00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:06.766
Then we will open a flower shop by the sea

29
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.100
Get two more dogs

30
00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.566
From now on, we will invite them to go for a walk every day

31
00:01:11.733 --> 00:01:12.700
Ok?

32
00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.666
Ok you trust me

33
00:01:16.933 --> 00:01:20.166
Haoran, I know you're just comforting me

34
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.800
Don't worry, I will be with you no matter what.

35
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.366
Even death
