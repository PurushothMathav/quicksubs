00:00:00.533 --> 00:00:02.066
Oh, two generals

2
00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:05.066
Didn't you ask me to hand over all the family wealth before?

3
00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.200
How did you end up here now?

4
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.000
Without military power, he is a homeless dog

5
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.100
Why are you rampant?

6
00:00:11.533 --> 00:00:13.566
Brother Wang didn't even look at what they did

7
00:00:14.266 --> 00:00:15.700
Rebellion with His Highness the Prince

8
00:00:15.966 --> 00:00:18.833
No, they killed the dead water, His Highness, merciful

9
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.200
You you what you

10
00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.366
Without military power, you are a homeless dog

11
00:00:22.366 --> 00:00:23.533
They don't even deserve to talk to us

12
00:00:23.533 --> 00:00:26.233
Just send someone to kill them

13
00:00:26.466 --> 00:00:27.633
Dare to commit crimes

14
00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:28.900
It's ridiculous

15
00:00:28.966 --> 00:00:32.833
I want to be even more stupid in front of His Royal Highness the Prince

16
00:00:32.966 --> 00:00:34.200
But I'm really looking for you

17
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.000
I miss you for my building

18
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.066
After guarding the border for many years

19
00:00:38.133 --> 00:00:40.000
I can give you a chance.

20
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.666
Just surrender to me

21
00:00:41.666 --> 00:00:44.566
I could consider sparing your life

22
00:00:44.766 --> 00:00:45.900
His Royal Highness is merciful

23
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:48.366
If you want to be mine, you will be torn to pieces

24
00:00:48.533 --> 00:00:50.533
Just a bunch of bereaved people

25
00:00:50.533 --> 00:00:52.233
What are you still putting up here?

26
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.466
Since you don't know the verdict

27
00:00:54.933 --> 00:00:56.966
Don't blame me for being heartless
