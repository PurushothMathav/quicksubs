00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.600
Dare to speak nonsense here

2
00:00:02.733 --> 00:00:05.800
What to say, I go home for the king of Zhenbei, the first battlefield

3
00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:07.766
Listen to what the prince has to say

4
00:00:07.766 --> 00:00:08.633
There can be fake

5
00:00:08.866 --> 00:00:12.066
Our little prince is also the son of my northern king

6
00:00:12.466 --> 00:00:15.300
Coming to Jiangnan soon to execute this traitor

7
00:00:15.366 --> 00:00:18.333
The vanguard army will be at the door soon

8
00:00:18.333 --> 00:00:20.700
You still touch him

9
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:24.133
Do you want to be a traitor like him?

10
00:00:24.133 --> 00:00:25.466
Let me tell you one more thing

11
00:00:25.466 --> 00:00:28.833
Why was Jiangnan banned for 20 years?

12
00:00:29.066 --> 00:00:31.300
All because of this traitor

13
00:00:31.366 --> 00:00:32.966
What is the Jiangnan disaster?

14
00:00:32.966 --> 00:00:33.733
All because of this man

15
00:00:33.733 --> 00:00:36.066
He and Lorraine are still pretending to be doing favors here

16
00:00:36.066 --> 00:00:37.966
I didn't expect this kid to be a liar

17
00:00:37.966 --> 00:00:39.366
Fortunately, the general came in time

18
00:00:39.366 --> 00:00:40.500
Otherwise, you will be deceived by him.

19
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.200
How dare a traitor be so arrogant

20
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.566
The general joked

21
00:00:44.566 --> 00:00:46.166
This traitor who is inferior to pigs and dogs

22
00:00:46.166 --> 00:00:47.666
How can we possibly turn to

23
00:00:47.933 --> 00:00:50.133
It was just because of the situation

24
00:00:50.133 --> 00:00:51.633
We are deliberately overbearing

25
00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.166
Now come the general

26
00:00:53.166 --> 00:00:54.900
So we kind of gave up.

27
00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:56.666
Hey hey hey yes yes yes

28
00:00:56.666 --> 00:00:57.466
general

29
00:00:57.933 --> 00:00:59.800
A traitor

30
00:00:59.933 --> 00:01:01.600
Dare to yell here

31
00:01:01.766 --> 00:01:02.566
Hey

32
00:01:02.933 --> 00:01:04.066
The general is here

33
00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.200
Surrender quickly

34
00:01:06.566 --> 00:01:08.433
A boneless traitor

35
00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.700
Pretending to be a pair of iron-clad magic

36
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.266
It's disgusting

37
00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:14.400
I still want my Qin family to go bankrupt

38
00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:16.500
Let everyone in Jiangnan turn against each other

39
00:01:16.566 --> 00:01:18.133
The little prince will be here soon

40
00:01:18.133 --> 00:01:21.066
I want to see you die without a burial

41
00:01:21.333 --> 00:01:23.933
What right do you have to talk nonsense?

42
00:01:23.933 --> 00:01:26.266
The whistle called me a traitor

43
00:01:26.333 --> 00:01:29.433
You are the son of his side

44
00:01:29.566 --> 00:01:31.666
Said I was the bloodline of a traitor
