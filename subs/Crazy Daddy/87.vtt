00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:02.266
You're so sure I don't have an invitation?

2
00:00:02.333 --> 00:00:03.533
Even our Lin family

3
00:00:03.533 --> 00:00:05.833
It also depends on the top families

4
00:00:05.933 --> 00:00:07.733
The invitation letter that the Xiao family just got

5
00:00:07.733 --> 00:00:09.100
Trash like you

6
00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:10.266
I'm afraid even in this lifetime

7
00:00:10.266 --> 00:00:12.233
You haven't even seen what the invitation letter looks like

8
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.800
How dare you not talk about it here?

9
00:00:15.766 --> 00:00:18.333
Maybe Liu Qingxue is a bitch?

10
00:00:18.333 --> 00:00:20.233
Who did you sleep with?

11
00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:24.000
You can sleep until an invitation letter, haha.

12
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:27.466
Too much you

13
00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:28.833
You rubbish

14
00:00:28.866 --> 00:00:32.800
You dare to hit me and I will kill you, can you believe it?

15
00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:34.666
This person not only lacks an invitation letter

16
00:00:34.866 --> 00:00:37.433
He also openly attacked the soldiers who participated in the military king's banquet

17
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.466
I think they're just here to make trouble.

18
00:00:39.466 --> 00:00:41.100
Grab his legs and they're all blue

19
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.666
Should interrupt his self-knowledge

20
00:00:42.766 --> 00:00:44.700
Throw it in the trash and go back

21
00:00:47.933 --> 00:00:49.100
The invitation letter is here

22
00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:50.433
Who dares to do it?

23
00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.433
I dare to run how can you ask

24
00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:00.766
You don't have to do it anymore, okay?

25
00:01:00.766 --> 00:01:02.200
Let's go

26
00:01:02.666 --> 00:01:04.833
Hahaha Xiao Chen

27
00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:06.566
You want to forge an invitation?

28
00:01:06.566 --> 00:01:08.400
At least go out and find out

29
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.733
Only bronze was distributed at this king's banquet

30
00:01:11.733 --> 00:01:12.133
Baiyun

31
00:01:12.133 --> 00:01:14.833
Invitation letters for these four grades of gold and diamonds

32
00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.300
You're holding a piece of black paper.

33
00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.666
You still want to get away with it?

34
00:01:20.066 --> 00:01:21.233
Forged invitation letter

35
00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.066
Sin is unforgivable

36
00:01:24.333 --> 00:01:26.200
A group of frogs in a well

37
00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:27.466
It's pitifully stupid

38
00:01:27.466 --> 00:01:30.100
Just because you haven't seen it doesn't mean you haven't

39
00:01:30.266 --> 00:01:33.000
This is a supreme invitation

40
00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.166
You can't

41
00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.366
Supreme Invitation

42
00:01:36.466 --> 00:01:39.066
But the highest-grade invitation letter at this king's banquet

43
00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:40.166
Only dead adults do

44
00:01:40.166 --> 00:01:42.233
Only death may be in your hands

45
00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:43.733
Is that possible?

46
00:01:43.733 --> 00:01:44.600
This invitation

47
00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.633
It was given to us by Lord Junhou himself

48
00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:51.566
Only beautiful kings can hold the Supreme Gold Invitation Letter

49
00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:52.966
It's not the best

50
00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:54.000
This

51
00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:55.700
self-guilt

52
00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:56.500
Nice

53
00:01:56.933 --> 00:01:59.233
The supreme invitees who pretended to lead the king's feast

54
00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:00.800
In the midst of sin

55
00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.366
Why isn't that possible?
