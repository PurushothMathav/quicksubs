00:00:00.466 --> 00:00:01.600
Why haven't you done it yet?

2
00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:03.100
Chongqing VIP cut

3
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:05.700
That's not possible.

4
00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:06.500
That's not possible.

5
00:00:06.566 --> 00:00:08.133
Are you blind?

6
00:00:08.133 --> 00:00:09.833
This is the guy.

7
00:00:09.966 --> 00:00:11.500
How could there be a supreme invitation?

8
00:00:11.566 --> 00:00:13.566
He doesn't even have the qualifications to support the king?

9
00:00:13.566 --> 00:00:14.966
This is the Supreme Invitation

10
00:00:14.966 --> 00:00:15.833
Absolutely.

11
00:00:15.933 --> 00:00:18.666
I think it's you guys who believe in the money right now

12
00:00:23.533 --> 00:00:25.766
Xiao Chen, where did you get the invitation letter?

13
00:00:25.766 --> 00:00:27.200
Or the supreme invitation

14
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.900
I heard that in the past, Lord Lords held king banquets

15
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.900
I have never sent anyone a supreme invitation letter.

16
00:00:33.066 --> 00:00:34.800
What is your identity?

17
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.266
Qianxue, you'll know when the banquet starts

18
00:00:38.733 --> 00:00:40.200
Xiao Chen, don't mess around

19
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.166
The invitation letter can't be fake, right?

20
00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.133
It's okay if you fake the invitation to the party

21
00:00:45.133 --> 00:00:46.900
If you fake the supreme invitation

22
00:00:47.133 --> 00:00:48.900
Isn't that causing trouble?

23
00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:51.466
Qingxue trust me

24
00:00:51.466 --> 00:00:53.866
Don't worry about everything else.

25
00:00:54.266 --> 00:00:56.100
How can you not worry?

26
00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:59.433
Counterfeit invitations are a serious crime for the nine clans

27
00:00:59.733 --> 00:01:01.600
If Lord Junhou comes down soon

28
00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:03.200
We're dead.

29
00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.866
No, Lord Junhou is very talkative.

30
00:01:05.866 --> 00:01:08.266
Even if it's fake, he won't say anything.

31
00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:09.600
Besides

32
00:01:11.933 --> 00:01:13.566
He is real

33
00:01:18.366 --> 00:01:19.800
Is it in the hands of that waste?

34
00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.200
It's really a supreme invitation

35
00:01:21.333 --> 00:01:23.100
Impossible absolutely impossible

36
00:01:23.533 --> 00:01:24.566
This trash

37
00:01:24.866 --> 00:01:25.933
What can he do?

38
00:01:25.933 --> 00:01:28.800
The supreme invitation letter that can be rewarded by the military lord

39
00:01:29.166 --> 00:01:30.266
Which invitation letter?

40
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.300
Absolutely not.

41
00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:33.900
But even the security guard didn't see it

42
00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.100
That request is still false

43
00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.866
Just two security guards

44
00:01:38.133 --> 00:01:40.233
Where have they seen the Supreme Invitation?

45
00:01:40.366 --> 00:01:41.966
How could they have imagined

46
00:01:41.966 --> 00:01:44.666
How dare you be so bold

47
00:01:44.766 --> 00:01:46.566
Dare to forge the supreme invitation letter

48
00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.066
So we just let them in.

49
00:01:49.066 --> 00:01:50.800
Then let them in.

50
00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.866
How dare you forge the Supreme Invitation Letter?

51
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.133
Box is the charge

52
00:01:54.133 --> 00:01:56.833
That's enough to make him die for ten thousand volumes

53
00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.566
Just in time to save us from specifying that trash

54
00:02:00.566 --> 00:02:02.966
Liu Shao, let's go in quickly

55
00:02:02.966 --> 00:02:04.966
I can't wait anymore.

56
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.333
Wait for the Wu Weijun to arrive

57
00:02:06.333 --> 00:02:07.600
We can see Xiaocheng

58
00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.500
How miserable will this trash end?
