00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:01.200
Font size banquet hall

2
00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:03.366
Tianzihao Banquet Hall?

3
00:00:03.566 --> 00:00:05.133
That's the whole of Yuncheng

4
00:00:05.133 --> 00:00:07.500
The hotel ballroom with the highest rules?

5
00:00:07.733 --> 00:00:08.600
In Yuncheng

6
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:11.666
Only the top few are eligible to use it.

7
00:00:11.666 --> 00:00:13.200
Yeah and ah

8
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.300
This sky-shaped banquet hall has been established since its establishment until now

9
00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:19.333
I heard that it has not been used more than 5 times.

10
00:00:19.333 --> 00:00:21.166
VIP status for each service

11
00:00:21.166 --> 00:00:24.400
At least 10% of the governor's level

12
00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:24.866
Ouch.

13
00:00:24.866 --> 00:00:28.100
I didn't expect Lin Shao, your energy is so great

14
00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:32.100
Hahaha, my father happens to be one of the top floors in Yuncheng.

15
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:33.933
That's why I have this opportunity today

16
00:00:33.933 --> 00:00:35.666
Haha, is that true?

17
00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:36.800
I have packed the whole

18
00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.166
One week at Tiangong Hotel

19
00:00:39.166 --> 00:00:42.433
Then you just enjoy the bag to the fullest

20
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.766
Pack the entire Tiangong Hotel for a week

21
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.700
That's going to cost hundreds of millions.

22
00:00:48.766 --> 00:00:51.466
Feng, this is a trifle, haha.

23
00:00:51.933 --> 00:00:54.033
My dad is really willing

24
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.700
I don't usually see him hurting my son

25
00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.700
He still attaches great importance to marriage

26
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.366
Mr. Lin, this is too expensive.

27
00:01:02.366 --> 00:01:03.700
Why don't you return it?

28
00:01:03.733 --> 00:01:05.900
Think again about the engagement

29
00:01:07.966 --> 00:01:10.100
Ah no drink no drink

30
00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.300
That's it, as long as it costs you

31
00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:13.600
No matter how expensive it is, I am willing to

32
00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.500
Haha oops

33
00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:16.900
Qingxue, don't be stupid

34
00:01:17.666 --> 00:01:19.766
Our Qingxue can be liked by Mr. Lin

35
00:01:19.766 --> 00:01:22.466
That's the smoke from our Liu family ancestral grave

36
00:01:22.466 --> 00:01:23.266
Hey, yes, yes, yes.

37
00:01:24.566 --> 00:01:26.366
Today you sit down and get engaged

38
00:01:26.366 --> 00:01:27.366
Don't go anywhere

39
00:01:27.366 --> 00:01:29.800
Miss Liu and a few others please come with me

40
00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.500
Go well hahaha

41
00:01:32.666 --> 00:01:34.900
Miss Liu, this is our Tianzi Ballroom

42
00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:36.600
Someone is already waiting inside

43
00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.200
Why must it be my father

44
00:01:39.266 --> 00:01:40.066
Humph

45
00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.066
Dad, here we come

46
00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:49.366
Why don't I remember you as a son?
