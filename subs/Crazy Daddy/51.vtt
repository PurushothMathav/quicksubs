1
00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:02.033
Give me as far as you can

2
00:00:02.366 --> 00:00:04.066
I am very normal

3
00:00:08.733 --> 00:00:10.533
Mr. Wang, you came just in time

4
00:00:10.533 --> 00:00:12.200
There's a kid who doesn't know how to live or die

5
00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.000
He framed me for changing the bidder who won the bidding

6
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.433
Also call your name

7
00:00:16.066 --> 00:00:16.333
Yes!

8
00:00:16.333 --> 00:00:18.900
Murong should always be severely punished for something like this

9
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.300
Better break his hands and feet

10
00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:21.533
Let them never be born

11
00:00:21.533 --> 00:00:23.600
Yes, Mr. Murong

12
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:28.300
Mr. Xiao, I'm really sorry.

13
00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:30.133
What happened today was not my intention

14
00:00:30.133 --> 00:00:32.566
It's all on this beast's own initiative

15
00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:35.466
It's not as good as the referee, but the celebrity around Gong Weijun

16
00:00:35.466 --> 00:00:37.366
How is this respectful to this trash?

17
00:00:37.366 --> 00:00:38.466
What's going on?

18
00:00:38.466 --> 00:00:39.300
That's not right.

19
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.433
We also fight

20
00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:42.766
What is Xiao Zhan's identity?

21
00:00:42.766 --> 00:00:44.766
Let's settle the Jinzhou conference first

22
00:00:44.766 --> 00:00:47.400
Say yes after these little things

23
00:00:48.933 --> 00:00:50.400
What are you?

24
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.666
How dare you tamper with my order

25
00:00:52.733 --> 00:00:54.666
Mr. Murong, are you kidding me?

26
00:00:54.666 --> 00:00:56.133
I won the bidding, didn't I?

27
00:00:56.133 --> 00:00:58.000
Liu Qingxue is a family member

28
00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.366
What qualifies him to win the bidding

29
00:00:59.366 --> 00:01:00.900
Are you mistaken?

30
00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:02.500
Oh, dear.

31
00:01:03.366 --> 00:01:04.600
Why are you hitting me?

32
00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.566
I'm just telling the truth, you bitch

33
00:01:07.566 --> 00:01:09.066
You are going to kill me

34
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.800
Haha President, I said it.

35
00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:12.900
Please forgive me.

36
00:01:13.133 --> 00:01:14.733
I won't let the leader win the bidding

37
00:01:14.733 --> 00:01:17.166
I don't think he has the ability to complete the project.

38
00:01:17.533 --> 00:01:18.666
I just created it.

39
00:01:18.666 --> 00:01:21.200
I really didn't mean it

40
00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.200
Did Liu Muscle Blood win the bidding?

41
00:01:24.266 --> 00:01:27.100
I refuse to accept that even if you are the president of the group

42
00:01:27.166 --> 00:01:28.800
You can't open the back door either, can you?

43
00:01:29.133 --> 00:01:31.666
The Liu family is really not qualified

44
00:01:31.666 --> 00:01:35.066
But Miss Liu Qingxue deserves her name

45
00:01:35.866 --> 00:01:38.533
I declare that starting today

46
00:01:38.533 --> 00:01:41.333
Tengrong Group will use the name of Liu Qingxue

47
00:01:41.333 --> 00:01:43.166
Funding for the Liu family

48
00:01:43.766 --> 00:01:46.266
10 billion and will Miss Liu Qingxue

49
00:01:46.266 --> 00:01:48.333
Listed as the first strategic partner

50
00:01:48.333 --> 00:01:49.900
Indefinite cooperation
