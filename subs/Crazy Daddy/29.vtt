00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.533
You big bad guy

2
00:00:01.533 --> 00:00:03.366
Don't scold my mom

3
00:00:03.366 --> 00:00:04.266
Shut up!

4
00:00:04.266 --> 00:00:05.666
My little bastard

5
00:00:05.666 --> 00:00:07.466
You bunch of trash

6
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.566
How many more people have you given our Liu family?

7
00:00:09.566 --> 00:00:11.700
If you dare to say one more word, will you rest?

8
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.700
Oops it hurts it hurts

9
00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:17.000
Look at you, you little bastard. Do you want to die?

10
00:00:17.166 --> 00:00:18.200
Let go of the beast

11
00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:19.666
I'm not here to make trouble.

12
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:20.933
Your family can't get a gift

13
00:00:20.933 --> 00:00:22.800
Say a few words and start working, right?

14
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.133
Today is my birthday party

15
00:00:24.133 --> 00:00:25.666
Whoever makes trouble gets out first

16
00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:27.166
Xiao Chen, let go

17
00:00:28.566 --> 00:00:31.466
Who said we had to prepare this gift?

18
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.100
When is it your turn to talk?

19
00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.700
What good can you come up with, you bereaved dog?

20
00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.266
Gifts taken out of garbage are naturally garbage.

21
00:00:39.266 --> 00:00:41.300
I think he can take it out

22
00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.966
By the way, take this opportunity to catch up

23
00:00:44.333 --> 00:00:46.000
Xiao Chen, don't mess around

24
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.366
Commenting on actors, right?

25
00:00:47.866 --> 00:00:49.000
What are you doing there?

26
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.533
The family didn't like to see us

27
00:00:50.533 --> 00:00:52.933
Are you so noisy that you can't make it worse?

28
00:00:52.933 --> 00:00:56.566
Second uncle has that intention anyway, right?

29
00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.966
No matter what, I have to let my grandfather see Liu

30
00:00:58.966 --> 00:01:01.000
Qingxue's filial piety

31
00:01:01.366 --> 00:01:02.166
What!

32
00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.900
What about gifts?

33
00:01:05.533 --> 00:01:06.600
On the way.

34
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.266
Why didn't you say it was in the sky on the way?

35
00:01:10.266 --> 00:01:12.533
Wait for your bull to fall to the ground

36
00:01:12.533 --> 00:01:14.233
The gift has arrived, right?

37
00:01:14.566 --> 00:01:17.200
Xiao Chen, you still think that I haven't hurt enough?

38
00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:18.000
Humph

39
00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.700
I'm too lazy to talk nonsense with you homeless dog

40
00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.733
Come on, kick the troublesome beggar's house out for me

41
00:01:23.733 --> 00:01:25.100
Receipt Road
