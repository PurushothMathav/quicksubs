00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.200
What's the situation with Mr. Liu now?

2
00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:03.800
We worked well on the construction site before.

3
00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:05.133
Suddenly a hooligan appeared

4
00:00:05.133 --> 00:00:06.200
They want us to pay protection money

5
00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:07.733
If you don't pay, hit our workers

6
00:00:07.733 --> 00:00:08.866
And smash our equipment

7
00:00:08.866 --> 00:00:10.700
How can you even connect a few little hooligans?

8
00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:11.733
Can't solve it

9
00:00:11.733 --> 00:00:13.300
No, they are too shameless.

10
00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:14.700
As soon as we called the police, they ran away

11
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.133
They come back as soon as they start work

12
00:00:16.133 --> 00:00:18.400
He also reversed the black and white video and pretended to be our workers.

13
00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.233
Said they owed them their wages

14
00:00:20.766 --> 00:00:23.700
So this is a premeditated targeting of our group

15
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:25.066
Someone must be jealous of us

16
00:00:25.066 --> 00:00:26.366
Took the project of Tenglong Group

17
00:00:26.366 --> 00:00:27.466
Want to get a black hand

18
00:00:27.466 --> 00:00:28.900
Once we delay the attack

19
00:00:29.066 --> 00:00:31.600
Even if you smash the pot and sell iron, you can't afford it.

20
00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.800
There must be someone behind these people

21
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:35.666
You take me to have a look first

22
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.900
Liu's Group owes wages

23
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.600
All champions of black-hearted enterprises

24
00:00:42.733 --> 00:00:44.866
Liu's Group

25
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.133
What conditions do you need to leave?

26
00:00:47.133 --> 00:00:50.333
Hahaha, you chick is pretty

27
00:00:50.333 --> 00:00:53.300
It's a pity that I'm talking to your boss

28
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:54.666
Tell you to come out responsibly

29
00:00:54.666 --> 00:00:56.600
You step aside for Lao Tzu

30
00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.466
I am such a person in charge, hahaha.

31
00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.433
What, you're the one in charge?

32
00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.100
You want us to go?

33
00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.066
Okay, then pay me back the 100 million you owe us.
