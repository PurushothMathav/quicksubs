1
00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.066
God can't watch it anymore

2
00:00:02.066 --> 00:00:04.000
Finally come through

3
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.200
Miss Liu, you are welcome.

4
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.000
From now on, we are partners

5
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.400
Please also advise

6
00:00:12.933 --> 00:00:15.566
Second child, Tonglong Group's project

7
00:00:15.566 --> 00:00:17.500
The bidding conference has ended.

8
00:00:17.666 --> 00:00:21.433
So you can play now. No.

9
00:00:21.733 --> 00:00:24.266
That's not what the big brother said

10
00:00:24.333 --> 00:00:26.866
You jump to conclusions before you even hear the results

11
00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:28.500
Are you in a hurry?

12
00:00:29.466 --> 00:00:31.466
What good happened to this result?

13
00:00:31.466 --> 00:00:34.000
Whoever wins the bidding may be in his blood

14
00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.866
So you let the blue blood bid in the first place

15
00:00:36.866 --> 00:00:38.466
It's to make things difficult on purpose

16
00:00:38.466 --> 00:00:40.200
We talk as a family

17
00:00:40.333 --> 00:00:42.000
What are you an outsider talking about?

18
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.766
And so what if it's difficult?

19
00:00:43.766 --> 00:00:45.166
It was because of him

20
00:00:45.166 --> 00:00:46.933
Let our Liu family lose face

21
00:00:46.933 --> 00:00:48.333
It's the talent and demerit of winning the bidding

22
00:00:48.333 --> 00:00:50.800
Brother, you said before

23
00:00:50.866 --> 00:00:53.533
If Qingxue wins the bidding, he can return to the Liu family

24
00:00:53.533 --> 00:00:57.666
Yes, I said that as long as you win the bidding, don't say go back to the Liu family

25
00:00:57.666 --> 00:01:01.000
Even if I give him a weapon for longevity ranking

26
00:01:01.066 --> 00:01:02.400
Did everyone win the bidding?

27
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:03.700
My ass

28
00:01:03.866 --> 00:01:06.066
Insider information has been sent out before

29
00:01:06.066 --> 00:01:08.600
Wanjia was determined in this bidding conference

30
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.933
What do you take with Wanjia?

31
00:01:10.933 --> 00:01:13.533
Without winning the bidding, everything is over

32
00:01:13.533 --> 00:01:15.233
Now get out

33
00:01:15.266 --> 00:01:18.666
Uncle, I'm afraid you will be disappointed this time.

34
00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.533
Yesterday's bidding conference of the Panglong Group

35
00:01:21.533 --> 00:01:23.566
Winning the bidding is

36
00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:25.366
Nonsense

37
00:01:25.366 --> 00:01:27.133
Don't say that Wanjia has been predetermined

38
00:01:27.133 --> 00:01:28.400
Even if there is no default

39
00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.300
It's not your turn to blog

40
00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:31.166
Exactly.

41
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.700
You haven't worked on a commercial project in years?

42
00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.166
Tenglong Group is only blind

43
00:01:37.166 --> 00:01:38.533
I will give you the project.

44
00:01:38.533 --> 00:01:41.133
I don't know if Tenglong Group is blind or not

45
00:01:41.133 --> 00:01:43.466
But if you're not blind

46
00:01:43.466 --> 00:01:45.466
See what this is.
