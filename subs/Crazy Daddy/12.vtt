1
00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:01.066
you

2
00:00:01.566 --> 00:00:02.933
What identity is it?

3
00:00:02.933 --> 00:00:05.766
Why does King Shura seem so respectful to you?

4
00:00:06.166 --> 00:00:08.666
Ah, King Shura

5
00:00:08.666 --> 00:00:10.833
approachable and upright

6
00:00:12.066 --> 00:00:15.266
Zhao Dejin's behavior completely angered his bottom line

7
00:00:15.266 --> 00:00:17.100
And he feels guilty about us

8
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.533
Naturally, it is also respectful

9
00:00:18.533 --> 00:00:19.400
Not to mention

10
00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:23.000
His boss is the legendary Wu Weijun

11
00:00:23.066 --> 00:00:24.333
Under his command

12
00:00:24.333 --> 00:00:27.300
How can you allow your subordinates to run amok?

13
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.300
bully

14
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.100
Qiuxue trust me

15
00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.266
One day you will accept me again

16
00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:57.100
Give it to me.

17
00:01:01.333 --> 00:01:03.166
Give me back the schoolbag.

18
00:01:03.166 --> 00:01:05.500
My mom says poor kids like you

19
00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.100
You are not qualified to go to school with us at all

20
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.433
My dad said that if he sold one of your dirty clothes

21
00:01:11.466 --> 00:01:13.466
If you don't eat, then I'll stay away from him

22
00:01:13.466 --> 00:01:17.633
I heard they make money by selling their bodies

23
00:01:17.666 --> 00:01:20.166
Isn't he a little wild boy?

24
00:01:20.166 --> 00:01:24.033
Don't insult my mom, don't let me say it, I'll say it

25
00:01:27.666 --> 00:01:31.200
Composition my father, isn't he Xiaoyun?

26
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.833
Where did the mother come from

27
00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.733
Maybe he has a bunch of dads hahaha

28
00:01:35.733 --> 00:01:38.133
Give me back my schoolbag

29
00:01:38.133 --> 00:01:41.400
Hahahahaha

30
00:01:45.866 --> 00:01:46.666
yang yang

31
00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.533
Why are you bullying my Yaoyao like this?

32
00:01:51.533 --> 00:01:54.500
I'm just telling the truth. Are you pissing me off?

33
00:01:55.733 --> 00:01:58.366
So many mouths at a young age

34
00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:04.033
Why do you still want to hit my son?

35
00:02:04.066 --> 00:02:06.133
This little bastard has no father, who doesn't know

36
00:02:06.133 --> 00:02:07.566
You stinky fish seller

37
00:02:07.566 --> 00:02:09.400
Can send him to a noble school

38
00:02:09.566 --> 00:02:12.600
In addition to going out, there are other profitable businesses

39
00:02:12.866 --> 00:02:13.800
Again

40
00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.933
My son, he told the truth. What's wrong?

41
00:02:15.933 --> 00:02:17.533
You are not allowed to say my mother

42
00:02:17.533 --> 00:02:19.433
You are not allowed to call me a little wild

43
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.200
Yo little beast and after

44
00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.000
You are an unnecessary little bastard

45
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.866
Your mother is a stinky fish seller

46
00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.833
The smell of fish up and down is disgusting

47
00:02:30.866 --> 00:02:33.300
I don't know the aristocratic image of the upper class

48
00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.700
How did you get in the way of a lowly person like you?

49
00:02:37.066 --> 00:02:39.400
My son has touched so many things

50
00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.000
Go back, we have to wash our hands well with disinfectant

51
00:02:46.966 --> 00:02:49.600
Say it again.
