00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.466
Please don't disturb us again in the future.

2
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.566
Are you going back to your own home?

3
00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:06.600
Hey

4
00:00:07.366 --> 00:00:08.166
Yaoyao

5
00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:10.233
Sleeping homeless

6
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.766
That day can only exist in him

7
00:00:13.466 --> 00:00:15.300
2 million Cao Cao

8
00:00:16.133 --> 00:00:17.566
It's not good to climb the mountain in the cold

9
00:00:18.133 --> 00:00:21.400
Your mother, look, your uncle doesn't have a home

10
00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:22.466
On the way.

11
00:00:22.466 --> 00:00:26.300
So poor we took him back.

12
00:00:27.766 --> 00:00:29.966
You you really have no place to live

13
00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:31.266
Don't play poor with me.

14
00:00:33.733 --> 00:00:36.433
After I was discharged, I had to live in a fish pond

15
00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:38.366
Can't pay the rent

16
00:00:38.366 --> 00:00:39.633
Can't eat

17
00:00:39.866 --> 00:00:41.400
Just lose this dress

18
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.533
Or you'll be discharged, and there are a few left.

19
00:00:43.533 --> 00:00:45.100
Can't change it once every half a month

20
00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:46.366
Can't afford it?

21
00:00:47.333 --> 00:00:48.266
Alright. Alright.

22
00:00:48.366 --> 00:00:51.266
But uncle can only temporarily remember that in our house

23
00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.700
When you have money, move out immediately

24
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.866
If you dare to do anything wrong in my house

25
00:00:55.866 --> 00:00:56.733
I don't have to tell you.

26
00:00:56.733 --> 00:00:57.733
Go by yourself

27
00:00:57.733 --> 00:00:59.266
Mom agrees

28
00:01:07.533 --> 00:01:08.366
uncle aunt

29
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:09.700
Long time no see.

30
00:01:11.133 --> 00:01:11.800
Cricket

31
00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.233
How did you bring this beast back?

32
00:01:14.933 --> 00:01:16.300
Xiao Chen, you white-eyed wolf

33
00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:17.933
How dare you come to our house?

34
00:01:17.933 --> 00:01:19.166
We have a distinguished guest coming to our house today

35
00:01:19.166 --> 00:01:20.466
I won't leave you for now

36
00:01:20.466 --> 00:01:21.566
Get out of here now

37
00:01:21.566 --> 00:01:22.966
Don't step on my floor

38
00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.933
Grandma, you can't change uncle's

39
00:01:25.933 --> 00:01:28.366
I want my uncle to be my father

40
00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.133
What's up, you little white sheep?

41
00:01:30.133 --> 00:01:31.600
I'll raise it.

42
00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:32.400
Since

43
00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.033
You, big and small, get out of our house together
