1
00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:02.666
Even if the sun comes out in the west

2
00:00:02.666 --> 00:00:05.600
It is impossible for this bid to fall to the Liu family

3
00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:07.200
Bunch of trash

4
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.966
How can I afford to undertake the projects of Tonggong Group?

5
00:00:12.366 --> 00:00:14.133
Qingxue, don't listen to him

6
00:00:14.133 --> 00:00:15.300
Believe in yourself

7
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:17.800
Xiao Chen, do you think I'm humiliated enough?

8
00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.066
I won't force you if you don't go

9
00:00:19.066 --> 00:00:20.833
But you have no right to stop me

10
00:00:21.933 --> 00:00:24.100
Liu Qingxue, don't go

11
00:00:24.333 --> 00:00:27.366
This dog thing around you is flamboyant

12
00:00:27.366 --> 00:00:28.266
Quite confident

13
00:00:28.266 --> 00:00:30.366
I'm still waiting for you to win the bid.

14
00:00:30.366 --> 00:00:31.900
Come and hit me in the face

15
00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:34.866
Jin Xue still has some time anyway

16
00:00:34.866 --> 00:00:37.066
Let's hope for a miracle

17
00:00:37.266 --> 00:00:39.333
I'm so sorry.

18
00:00:39.333 --> 00:00:41.633
There was a small delay just now.

19
00:00:41.766 --> 00:00:43.633
Now I'm officially announcing

20
00:00:43.733 --> 00:00:46.666
The successful bidding of this project bidding conference is

21
00:00:48.133 --> 00:00:49.400
MasterCard

22
00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.700
Oops some people

23
00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.600
I don't know where the confidence comes from

24
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.400
A bunch of ants dare to argue with me

25
00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:58.833
humiliate yourself

26
00:00:59.933 --> 00:01:02.133
Xiao Chen, is that enough now?

27
00:01:02.133 --> 00:01:03.266
Give me face

28
00:01:03.266 --> 00:01:04.900
This is what you said about winning the bidding

29
00:01:06.266 --> 00:01:08.066
Qingxue, listen to my explanation

30
00:01:08.066 --> 00:01:09.866
They must have cheated. Cheating.

31
00:01:10.333 --> 00:01:12.533
The Wanjiazhong specimen is well-deserved

32
00:01:12.533 --> 00:01:15.100
I shouldn't have come in in the first place with clear snow

33
00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.500
The Gold Label Conference has ended.

34
00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.000
I won the bidding

35
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.900
We can also calculate our accounts well

36
00:01:22.066 --> 00:01:24.200
The Gold Label Conference is not over yet

37
00:01:24.866 --> 00:01:27.733
Luo Zhiqiang, you are for your own selfish desires

38
00:01:27.733 --> 00:01:30.466
Forcibly tampering with the decision of the senior management of Tenglong Group

39
00:01:30.466 --> 00:01:32.200
What is your crime?
