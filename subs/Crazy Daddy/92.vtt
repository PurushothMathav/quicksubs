00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.133
It's this trash in front of me

2
00:00:02.133 --> 00:00:04.366
Judge me in the morning

3
00:00:04.366 --> 00:00:05.800
Don't you deserve it?

4
00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:07.766
Hahahaha

5
00:00:07.766 --> 00:00:09.266
How funny!

6
00:00:09.333 --> 00:00:13.300
I don't deserve it, so I'll ask the future 5 soldiers

7
00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:14.933
Does Xiao Dasheng deserve it?

8
00:00:14.933 --> 00:00:16.000
He doesn't deserve it either

9
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
No one in this world is qualified to judge

10
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.500
Xiao Chen, let me ask you again.

11
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.866
If I judge you on behalf of Wu Weijun?

12
00:00:25.866 --> 00:00:27.400
On behalf of Wu Weijun

13
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:30.166
You are more worthy of humming

14
00:00:30.966 --> 00:00:33.933
I don't deserve to talk nonsense

15
00:00:33.933 --> 00:00:36.466
I'm going to judge you here today.

16
00:00:36.466 --> 00:00:40.500
Stupid, I want you to suffer a thousand times more than me

17
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.700
Lin Shaoyang, what are you crazy about?

18
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:44.133
This is the king's banquet

19
00:00:44.133 --> 00:00:45.800
Do you have to do things so well?

20
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.000
You bitch

21
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.166
All I have to do is

22
00:00:48.566 --> 00:00:49.833
If it weren't for depression

23
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.366
Can I become the ghost I am today?

24
00:00:52.533 --> 00:00:55.266
Depressed, I can't wait to skin you and cramp you

25
00:00:55.333 --> 00:00:57.100
Let you suffer to death

26
00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.266
Liu Qingxue, don't worry about this wild man

27
00:01:01.666 --> 00:01:03.866
After I slowly tortured him to death

28
00:01:03.866 --> 00:01:05.500
I'll settle the bill with you again.

29
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.900
When the time comes, I will let you dog men and women

30
00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:10.566
Be a companion on Huangquan Road

31
00:01:10.566 --> 00:01:12.100
Ok Liu Shaoyang

32
00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:13.133
That being the case

33
00:01:13.133 --> 00:01:16.100
Just let me see how you're going to judge

34
00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:17.966
Since you are in a hurry to die

35
00:01:18.133 --> 00:01:19.633
Then I will fulfill you

36
00:01:19.766 --> 00:01:21.966
Xiao Chen is fine, Qingxue

37
00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.066
The dinner hasn't started yet

38
00:01:24.166 --> 00:01:26.866
I'll play a game with them

39
00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:28.633
Trial begins

40
00:01:28.866 --> 00:01:30.000
Here we go.

41
00:01:30.166 --> 00:01:33.566
I will list the many crimes of Xiao Chen, this trash

42
00:01:33.566 --> 00:01:35.166
Let him die a worthy death

43
00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.666
first sin

44
00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.000
He killed his parents.

45
00:01:39.133 --> 00:01:40.633
rebellious

46
00:01:40.866 --> 00:01:42.166
This Xiao Chen

47
00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.233
He was originally the young master Xiao Zhan of the Xiao family in the imperial capital

48
00:01:45.966 --> 00:01:49.266
Eight years ago, he murdered his biological parents

49
00:01:49.266 --> 00:01:50.600
absconding from crime

50
00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.566
So far he has no repentance

51
00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:54.500
You are talking nonsense

52
00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.500
What evidence do you have that I killed my biological parents?
