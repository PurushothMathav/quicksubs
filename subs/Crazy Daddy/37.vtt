1
00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.066
Is there any snow?

2
00:00:01.066 --> 00:00:03.900
Ah, where did you hide? Hey, I'm not excited.

3
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.400
How dare we, the small family of the Liu family, oppose you?

4
00:00:07.733 --> 00:00:09.500
Find a cultivator

5
00:00:10.066 --> 00:00:11.066
Not a small employee

6
00:00:11.333 --> 00:00:15.100
Maybe they are the king above ten thousand people

7
00:00:15.366 --> 00:00:18.133
Although you said that you ranked the best in the Ming Dynasty

8
00:00:18.133 --> 00:00:21.400
But how could you possibly beat him in the Republic of China?

9
00:00:21.766 --> 00:00:23.133
Hahahaha

10
00:00:23.133 --> 00:00:24.400
Retro for you

11
00:00:24.733 --> 00:00:26.633
Chaochen this dog

12
00:00:26.666 --> 00:00:29.066
How dare you pretend to be the one in the sky?

13
00:00:29.066 --> 00:00:30.266
How many heads does he have?

14
00:00:31.533 --> 00:00:33.900
These babies on the table tomorrow

15
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:35.100
It's all Xiao Chen demolition

16
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.033
From the Ministry of Mischief and the King of Nothingness

17
00:00:37.133 --> 00:00:39.566
1 billion worth, you say

18
00:00:40.133 --> 00:00:41.566
Could it be that I am the king?

19
00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:43.466
So deceived

20
00:00:43.666 --> 00:00:46.933
Xiao Zhang, haven't you watched Xinwu recently?

21
00:00:46.933 --> 00:00:49.000
King Asura angered Wu Weijun

22
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.766
It is said that it only angered the wife of the Puvians

23
00:00:51.766 --> 00:00:53.333
He has now been removed.

24
00:00:53.333 --> 00:00:54.700
The Underground King's Hat

25
00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:57.400
He doesn't even have enough land in Cloud City right now

26
00:00:57.766 --> 00:00:59.666
As for Huo Jingliang?

27
00:00:59.666 --> 00:01:00.833
That's even worse

28
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:02.400
I don't know why.

29
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.166
Also touched the Wu Weijun

30
00:01:04.166 --> 00:01:06.400
Leading to the official gate of his school

31
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:07.966
As for his Huo Group

32
00:01:07.966 --> 00:01:10.300
Can it continue to operate normally in the future?

33
00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:11.566
Hard to say

34
00:01:11.566 --> 00:01:14.333
So the two of them are outdated.

35
00:01:14.333 --> 00:01:15.800
Phoenix is not as good as it is today

36
00:01:16.266 --> 00:01:19.600
So what's up with all these good reasons?

37
00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:20.700
I just found out

38
00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.533
Xiao Chen, this waste, retired from the army.

39
00:01:23.533 --> 00:01:26.033
The original army was officially armed

40
00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.533
After all, he is also a member of the Wuwei Army

41
00:01:29.533 --> 00:01:30.766
King Shura is also good

42
00:01:30.766 --> 00:01:32.133
Huo Jingliang

43
00:01:32.133 --> 00:01:35.066
Speaking of which, I just want to find a throw pillow for a big well.

44
00:01:35.066 --> 00:01:36.566
Please let Wu Weijun go

45
00:01:36.566 --> 00:01:38.066
Make up for depression

46
00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:41.400
I guess I just want a chance to ask for forgiveness

47
00:01:42.766 --> 00:01:45.033
But I want to hug a thigh

48
00:01:45.266 --> 00:01:47.633
I don't want to hug where is it?

49
00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.900
Hahaha hey

50
00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:51.633
How many of you may not know?

51
00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.166
Xiao Chan is just a little veteran

52
00:01:54.533 --> 00:01:57.566
Although he came from the same place as Wu Weijun

53
00:01:57.566 --> 00:02:01.766
But he doesn't deserve to give that shoe shine a qualification

54
00:02:02.066 --> 00:02:06.000
I can only say that Xiao Chen, this beast, will really be fooled

55
00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.666
He actually let him from King Shura and Huo Jingniang

56
00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.600
So many things have been fooled

57
00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.233
I fooled all you idiots
