00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:01.566
You do it for your own selfish desires

2
00:00:01.566 --> 00:00:04.300
Forcibly tampering with the decision of the senior management of Tenglong Group

3
00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:05.900
What is your crime?

4
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:09.766
Who are you?

5
00:00:09.766 --> 00:00:11.300
Why are you talking nonsense here?

6
00:00:12.066 --> 00:00:13.100
husband

7
00:00:14.166 --> 00:00:15.633
Don't listen to him

8
00:00:15.733 --> 00:00:18.900
He's a ex-rapist.

9
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.966
He came to make trouble with Liu Xianxia

10
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.700
He almost hit me!

11
00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:26.000
Okay, you dog

12
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.266
How dare you disrupt the territory of our Tenglong Group?

13
00:00:29.266 --> 00:00:31.300
Do I think you want to die?

14
00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.533
Come on, break that guy's leg for me

15
00:00:34.533 --> 00:00:35.266
Go for a walk

16
00:00:35.266 --> 00:00:38.866
A dog tampered with its owner's mind without authorization

17
00:00:38.866 --> 00:00:40.500
If Murong Lan knew about this

18
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.700
You have to guess what's going to happen

19
00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:43.500
bold

20
00:00:43.966 --> 00:00:45.600
You not only dare to slander me

21
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.400
You only know the name of the president of our Tanglong Group

22
00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.266
I see you don't want to live anymore

23
00:00:50.266 --> 00:00:52.200
I was going to break your leg

24
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.366
Just throw it out

25
00:00:53.366 --> 00:00:54.733
Since you want to die so much

26
00:00:54.733 --> 00:00:57.100
I will break your hands and feet

27
00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.433
Let you only be a dog crawling for the rest of your life

28
00:00:59.566 --> 00:01:01.500
It's not enough to just hurt your hands and feet

29
00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.366
This trash is talkative

30
00:01:03.366 --> 00:01:05.466
Better pull out his tongue. Yeah

31
00:01:05.766 --> 00:01:08.800
Slander is when you relabel winners

32
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.933
From Liu Qingxue to Wanjia

33
00:01:10.933 --> 00:01:11.966
It's not slander.

34
00:01:11.966 --> 00:01:14.666
It's the truth. Are you kidding?

35
00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:16.666
Even if the whole audience turns

36
00:01:16.666 --> 00:01:17.866
It can't be his turn

37
00:01:17.866 --> 00:01:19.566
Have savings

38
00:01:19.566 --> 00:01:20.933
What does it mean to be away from my house?

39
00:01:20.933 --> 00:01:23.833
Mitsubishi can't even rank in the clouds

40
00:01:23.966 --> 00:01:26.200
He didn't even get in the door.

41
00:01:27.266 --> 00:01:29.400
Xiao Chen, you have to make a mess that can't end

42
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.066
Only when your hands and feet are broken are you satisfied.

43
00:01:31.066 --> 00:01:33.600
It's them who can't end the trouble

44
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.966
I'm going to ask you one last time.

45
00:01:35.966 --> 00:01:38.466
Who is the successful bidder?

46
00:01:38.466 --> 00:01:40.566
Do you still give me a chance?

47
00:01:40.566 --> 00:01:42.400
Did I give you face?

48
00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.000
Winning the bidding must be our Lingling

49
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.266
Even if Tianwang Lao Tzu comes, this is the result

50
00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:49.433
Somebody help me!

51
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.600
Break this trash 'hands and feet for me

52
00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.366
Cut this tongue out for me again

53
00:01:54.366 --> 00:01:56.266
Throw me as far as you want
