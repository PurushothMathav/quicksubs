00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:02.166
Can't do it at all

2
00:00:02.166 --> 00:00:04.766
Xiao Chen, where did you get the invitation letter from?

3
00:00:04.766 --> 00:00:06.700
Hahaha Xiao Chen

4
00:00:06.733 --> 00:00:08.133
How dare you?

5
00:00:08.133 --> 00:00:10.366
Yeah, where did this invitation come from?

6
00:00:10.366 --> 00:00:13.600
Or did you get in by forging a fake invitation?

7
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:15.066
Ok Xiaoshan

8
00:00:15.066 --> 00:00:17.700
How dare you forge Jun Wangyan's invitation letter?

9
00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:19.766
So bold

10
00:00:19.766 --> 00:00:20.966
That being the case

11
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.300
Then I will judge you on behalf of the king

12
00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:24.766
Judge you to the end

13
00:00:24.766 --> 00:00:25.866
It's my sin.

14
00:00:25.866 --> 00:00:27.466
Let alone the Xiao family

15
00:00:27.466 --> 00:00:30.400
Even if the king of heaven comes, he can't cure my sins

16
00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:31.200
Liu Xuxue

17
00:00:31.666 --> 00:00:34.600
My Liu family will give you one last chance

18
00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:38.366
Hurry up and let this trash kneel down and apologize to Master Xiao

19
00:00:38.366 --> 00:00:39.933
Otherwise, it will anger Master Xiao

20
00:00:39.933 --> 00:00:42.233
You're not going to walk out that door today.

21
00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:44.600
Xiao Chen, why don't you learn it all?

22
00:00:45.066 --> 00:00:45.866
Don't be afraid.

23
00:00:45.866 --> 00:00:48.833
They're no threat at all

24
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:50.400
everyone

25
00:00:51.133 --> 00:00:52.700
Today Jun Wangyan

26
00:00:52.766 --> 00:00:55.266
This is my peak heyday in Great Xia

27
00:00:55.266 --> 00:00:57.700
But helplessly, there is mouse shit mixed in

28
00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:58.600
This mouse shit

29
00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.700
Not only is it deceived by the name of the five soldiers

30
00:01:01.866 --> 00:01:03.400
More arrogant

31
00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:04.400
today

32
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.600
By the name of the king's feast

33
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.500
I invite you to join me.

34
00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.333
Judge this heinous man

35
00:01:10.333 --> 00:01:12.966
Let him die without a burial

36
00:01:12.966 --> 00:01:15.066
Lord Wu Weijun is jealous of evil

37
00:01:15.466 --> 00:01:16.366
I think

38
00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.166
It is fitting to place this judgment at the king's feast

39
00:01:20.166 --> 00:01:24.600
Finally, let Aunt Wu Weijun judge this person by herself

40
00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.533
You are so unreasonable

41
00:01:26.533 --> 00:01:28.400
The building is known as the first hand of the five natures

42
00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.966
How dare anyone do illegal things in his name?

43
00:01:30.966 --> 00:01:32.600
What should be killed is more than what should be killed

44
00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.266
It should be a thousand cuts

45
00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:35.700
I don't know who this bastard is

46
00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.166
I think it's better to judge him on the spot

47
00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:39.800
Don't stain Wu Weijun's hands

48
00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:40.600
everyone

49
00:01:41.166 --> 00:01:44.766
The one on trial today is this trash in front of me

50
00:01:44.766 --> 00:01:45.566
depressed
