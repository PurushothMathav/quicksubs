1
00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.266
Then get out of my way

2
00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.166
What are you doing? Can't you hear Xu Yao?

3
00:00:08.166 --> 00:00:09.866
Kneel down and apologize

4
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.100
Otherwise, you will have no place in Yuncheng

5
00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.966
Sister brother-in-law

6
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:15.766
You are simply too kind

7
00:00:15.766 --> 00:00:16.866
Up to now

8
00:00:16.866 --> 00:00:19.600
That trash is still thinking about how to act tough

9
00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.866
Hmph, just kneel down

10
00:00:21.866 --> 00:00:24.166
You have to kneel all day and night

11
00:00:24.166 --> 00:00:25.800
Is that sincere?

12
00:00:26.166 --> 00:00:28.066
Oops oops oops

13
00:00:28.066 --> 00:00:30.200
Xu Shao, this has nothing to do with us

14
00:00:30.266 --> 00:00:32.600
It's all that trash talking nonsense

15
00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:33.500
It has nothing to do with us.

16
00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.033
If you want to punish, punish him

17
00:00:35.166 --> 00:00:36.866
Things are not fast, kneel down

18
00:00:36.866 --> 00:00:38.200
Let me kneel

19
00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.466
Let me have a place in Yuncheng

20
00:00:40.466 --> 00:00:42.400
You are not qualified yet

21
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.000
Stinky trash, you don't know yet

22
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.800
The Xu family is backed by the Huo family

23
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.600
Huo Jingliang, the richest man in Huo

24
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.366
And his old man's right-hand man

25
00:00:51.366 --> 00:00:53.400
Said that you couldn't get along in Yuncheng

26
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.633
You don't even have a chance to beg in Yuncheng

27
00:00:56.766 --> 00:00:59.366
I understand brother, why are you telling him this?

28
00:00:59.366 --> 00:01:00.966
What about high world things?

29
00:01:00.966 --> 00:01:03.300
This kind of pariah at the bottom will not move

30
00:01:03.466 --> 00:01:04.200
Uh, yeah.

31
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:05.366
Kneel down now

32
00:01:05.366 --> 00:01:06.900
Don't make Xu Shang angry

33
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.266
Otherwise you can't afford the consequences

34
00:01:09.266 --> 00:01:12.400
Huo Jingliang has to hold a handrail in front of me

35
00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.966
Why are you so arrogant as a subordinate?

36
00:01:15.266 --> 00:01:16.100
Hey

37
00:01:16.933 --> 00:01:18.900
bold boy

38
00:01:18.966 --> 00:01:21.700
How dare you call Huo's richest man by his name?

39
00:01:21.866 --> 00:01:23.366
I see you are alive

40
00:01:23.366 --> 00:01:25.733
I'm sorry, Xu Shao, Xiao Chen has a problem with his brain

41
00:01:25.733 --> 00:01:27.266
Don't take his words seriously

42
00:01:27.733 --> 00:01:28.600
Yes, sir.

43
00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:29.700
he

44
00:01:30.066 --> 00:01:31.366
If you want to punish, punish him

45
00:01:31.366 --> 00:01:33.066
Our family is innocent

46
00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.366
Why did Huo Jingliang's name become taboo?

47
00:01:36.366 --> 00:01:38.700
I call him and he can cut off my life

48
00:01:38.766 --> 00:01:41.566
Offended in Yuncheng

49
00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.666
Life or death is really up to you

50
00:01:43.666 --> 00:01:45.966
Come on, drag this trash down for me

51
00:01:45.966 --> 00:01:47.233
Break limbs

52
00:01:47.466 --> 00:01:49.666
Throw it around the house with the dog

53
00:01:49.766 --> 00:01:50.600
Who should I dare?
