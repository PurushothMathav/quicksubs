00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.933
Junhao, I'm afraid to protect the lady's hand and report it down

2
00:00:05.933 --> 00:00:08.066
Madam is in danger at the construction site

3
00:00:08.566 --> 00:00:11.566
Why are there so many people courting death recently?

4
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.033
Others protect good nutrition

5
00:00:13.133 --> 00:00:14.700
There can be no kindness

6
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:15.500
Yes

7
00:00:16.466 --> 00:00:18.366
Emotions are touched by Qingxue

8
00:00:18.366 --> 00:00:20.266
Watching TV woke them up

9
00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:25.366
Why don't you rob a bank for $100 million?

10
00:00:25.366 --> 00:00:28.400
If you rob a bank, you will make a lot of money here

11
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:29.466
Your project

12
00:00:29.466 --> 00:00:31.800
You're going to make 80 billion in the end.

13
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.266
It's not too much to give us a 1/1,000

14
00:00:35.466 --> 00:00:36.933
You are just looking for trouble on purpose

15
00:00:36.933 --> 00:00:39.466
Find fault, but we find fault.

16
00:00:39.466 --> 00:00:42.900
We are all serious workers.

17
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:44.533
How is it possible to find fault

18
00:00:44.533 --> 00:00:46.166
If you can't come up with 100 million

19
00:00:46.166 --> 00:00:49.966
It depends on whether you agree or not.

20
00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.266
You said that is to take turns accompanying me and

21
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:54.766
Brothers sleep

22
00:00:54.766 --> 00:00:57.500
As long as you serve me and my brothers well, ah

23
00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.600
Everything else is fine

24
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.533
Hahaha, you really don't have a king's law anymore.

25
00:01:02.533 --> 00:01:05.900
Wang Fa Yunchen Lao Tzu is a bastard

26
00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:07.866
You little girl can shout

27
00:01:07.866 --> 00:01:09.933
Get me this little girl

28
00:01:09.933 --> 00:01:11.700
Let the brothers have a good time first

29
00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:12.733
Like to shout

30
00:01:12.733 --> 00:01:16.366
I'll let you shout enough later, hahaha.

31
00:01:16.366 --> 00:01:17.266
Do not come

32
00:01:18.966 --> 00:01:21.000
You guys play first

33
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.133
As for this level, leave it to me

34
00:01:24.133 --> 00:01:27.266
You bastards dare to bully in broad daylight

35
00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.766
I don't know how to live or die

36
00:01:29.766 --> 00:01:33.066
Wait a minute, I'll make you feel good
