00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:03.600
He is still slandering the king when he is about to die

2
00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.900
Your chance to stand and speak now is king

3
00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:10.800
In the Foreign War

4
00:00:10.866 --> 00:00:14.833
With sadness and blood, you fought your life for it

5
00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.466
You don't want anything in return.

6
00:00:17.466 --> 00:00:19.600
Let's talk nonsense here

7
00:00:19.866 --> 00:00:22.000
I once went to the Imperial Foreign Battlefield

8
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.400
I saw Wu Weijun's character style

9
00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.166
His old man is the king of the country

10
00:00:26.166 --> 00:00:27.466
How is it in your eyes?

11
00:00:27.466 --> 00:00:29.633
It becomes so insignificant

12
00:00:29.766 --> 00:00:30.666
The general

13
00:00:31.066 --> 00:00:33.600
The so-called ignorant, the fearless.

14
00:00:33.766 --> 00:00:34.766
He doesn't know anything.

15
00:00:34.766 --> 00:00:36.866
That's why I dare to be so tall

16
00:00:37.333 --> 00:00:40.066
It's not like I haven't been to the accidental battlefield

17
00:00:40.066 --> 00:00:41.933
He wasn't the only one who fought in blood

18
00:00:41.933 --> 00:00:44.200
The Wu Wei army and thousands of generals

19
00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:45.466
Who gave you the courage?

20
00:00:45.466 --> 00:00:46.333
Give all the credit

21
00:00:46.333 --> 00:00:47.766
All credit to him alone

22
00:00:47.766 --> 00:00:48.700
kid

23
00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.666
I see you are tired of living

24
00:00:52.266 --> 00:00:56.100
I almost forgot that this kid was in the Wei Wu Army

25
00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.666
He's a veteran.

26
00:00:57.666 --> 00:01:01.266
No wonder you put gold on your face so much

27
00:01:01.333 --> 00:01:03.233
You are an ordinary soldier

28
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.366
He De He Neng

29
00:01:04.366 --> 00:01:07.000
Dare to take the credit of the Wei Wu Army on yourself

30
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:07.800
And so forth.

31
00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:10.733
You're wrong.

32
00:01:10.733 --> 00:01:12.000
As far as I know

33
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.900
The Wuwei army numbers the frontier

34
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.066
No one is discharged

35
00:01:15.066 --> 00:01:15.700
But this kid

36
00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:18.233
It is said that he was discharged from the Wu Wei Army

37
00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.566
Could it be a deserter?

38
00:01:20.566 --> 00:01:22.066
Hahahaha

39
00:01:22.966 --> 00:01:24.533
Border deserters

40
00:01:24.533 --> 00:01:26.533
This is his fourth crime

41
00:01:26.533 --> 00:01:28.900
Shangchen didn't expect it, didn't expect it?

42
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Do you have any other surprises?

43
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.533
I have more surprises

44
00:01:33.533 --> 00:01:35.866
I'm just afraid you can't take it

45
00:01:35.866 --> 00:01:37.000
Forgiveness deepens

46
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.233
No matter how many surprises you have, it's easy to escape
