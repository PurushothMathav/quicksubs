00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.800
Where did the stinky beggar come from?

2
00:00:01.866 --> 00:00:03.700
How dare you claim my gift?

3
00:00:04.766 --> 00:00:07.500
This gift turned out to be from Xu Shao

4
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:08.900
You don't even think about it.

5
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.500
Don't say this trash can afford a mansion

6
00:00:11.733 --> 00:00:14.833
He can't even afford a toilet in a mansion, can he?

7
00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:17.066
I love you so much, you said it earlier

8
00:00:17.266 --> 00:00:19.300
We were tricked by him.

9
00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.100
Doesn't he like to act tough?

10
00:00:21.133 --> 00:00:23.100
I just want everyone to see

11
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.000
He pretended to be a clown after being exposed.

12
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.800
clown

13
00:00:26.866 --> 00:00:29.266
It's not yours, why are you showing your face?

14
00:00:29.366 --> 00:00:30.766
My gift hasn't arrived yet.

15
00:00:30.766 --> 00:00:32.266
It's just a misunderstanding.

16
00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:35.800
Misunderstanding, is it through something and then returning it?

17
00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.000
It can be a misunderstanding

18
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.600
It's your business

19
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.566
I'll settle the bill with you later

20
00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:42.000
Hey

21
00:00:42.366 --> 00:00:46.400
Grandpa, on behalf of the Xu family, I wish you happiness like the East China Sea

22
00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:47.866
Shoubinan Mountain

23
00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:49.533
Xu Shao is polite

24
00:00:49.533 --> 00:00:52.000
I can't stand such a heavy gift.

25
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.133
Fortunately, you can buy it.

26
00:00:53.133 --> 00:00:55.433
Otherwise, you will be deceived by this villain.

27
00:00:55.666 --> 00:00:57.600
Xu Shao, you are so kind

28
00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:59.466
I knew it!

29
00:00:59.466 --> 00:01:03.233
These receptions are definitely not sent by waste depression

30
00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:06.533
Second brother, did you find a good son-in-law?

31
00:01:06.533 --> 00:01:08.433
How dare you risk my son-in-law's acceptance

32
00:01:08.533 --> 00:01:09.966
This is iron, not shit

33
00:01:09.966 --> 00:01:11.166
Disgusting

34
00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:13.400
Xiao Chen, why are you doing this?

35
00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.766
I said it was just a misunderstanding

36
00:01:15.766 --> 00:01:18.300
Besides, these things are not expensive

37
00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:19.966
My gift will arrive soon.

38
00:01:19.966 --> 00:01:21.133
Then you will see

39
00:01:21.133 --> 00:01:23.200
Those are the surprises I prepared for you

40
00:01:23.366 --> 00:01:25.166
Huh surprise

41
00:01:25.166 --> 00:01:26.566
Things from my Xu family

42
00:01:26.566 --> 00:01:29.166
It's also what you poor and poor trash can get famous for

43
00:01:29.166 --> 00:01:31.566
Today is the birthday banquet for Mr. Liu

44
00:01:31.566 --> 00:01:33.066
I won't embarrass you either.

45
00:01:33.066 --> 00:01:35.100
Bring the whole family to kowtow to me and apologize

46
00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.233
Then get out of my way
