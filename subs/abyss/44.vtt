1
00:00:04.766 --> 00:00:06.133
Lu Gongzi is really forgetful

2
00:00:06.133 --> 00:00:08.033
Forget our conversation so soon

3
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:11.866
I won't go with you in the future, will I?

4
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.466
Senior Brother Lu Xue

5
00:00:15.466 --> 00:00:18.400
I thought he would definitely come with me

6
00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.233
Brother, time is running out

7
00:00:20.533 --> 00:00:21.366
let go

8
00:00:21.966 --> 00:00:23.200
I let you go

9
00:00:26.966 --> 00:00:28.066
After the car accident

10
00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:29.800
The master's car is fully locked

11
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.600
It's been parked at the scrap center.

12
00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.100
Two surveys by the training institute

13
00:00:33.133 --> 00:00:34.766
Not a clue

14
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.000
This is obviously different from Song Yichuan's caliber

15
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.366
Brother, trust me.

16
00:00:39.366 --> 00:00:40.233
Certainly.

17
00:00:40.766 --> 00:00:42.233
I have doubts about the appraisal results

18
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:43.500
After returning home

19
00:00:43.766 --> 00:00:46.100
He has been secretly investigating Song Yuchuan

20
00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:47.666
Since the wolf's ambition is false

21
00:00:47.666 --> 00:00:49.300
It's not impossible.

22
00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.000
I contacted the appraisal experts

23
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.066
We're going to the scrap center now to take the exam with him

24
00:00:55.366 --> 00:00:56.466
The death of the master

25
00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.600
But let's just forget it.

26
00:00:58.866 --> 00:01:00.266
Thank you, brother.

27
00:01:00.266 --> 00:01:02.233
What did the fool say to me thank you

28
00:01:11.766 --> 00:01:12.833
That is

29
00:01:16.066 --> 00:01:18.800
How could that be dad's car?
