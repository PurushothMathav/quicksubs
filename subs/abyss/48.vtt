00:00:04.733 --> 00:00:05.866
It's too late.

2
00:00:07.566 --> 00:00:10.833
Brother, thank you for taking care of me and sending me back

3
00:00:11.166 --> 00:00:13.100
Don't be too tired of Changan

4
00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:14.766
Do I know everything?

5
00:00:14.766 --> 00:00:15.900
Don't worry.

6
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.366
My fever is gone now and I'm still alive and kicking.

7
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:21.566
For you.

8
00:00:22.266 --> 00:00:23.966
It's a gift.

9
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:26.633
The gift of healing

10
00:00:28.533 --> 00:00:30.533
Miss Tang, are you dating Director Du?

11
00:00:30.533 --> 00:00:32.566
It is rumored on the Internet that your divorce from Best Actor Song did not go well.

12
00:00:32.566 --> 00:00:33.866
Someone is secretly protecting you

13
00:00:33.866 --> 00:00:34.800
Is it Director Du?

14
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.933
There are media reports that Du Xinghe is your first love

15
00:00:36.933 --> 00:00:37.666
Is that true?

16
00:00:37.666 --> 00:00:40.100
Miss Tang, are you and Director Du close?

17
00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.133
Yeah, when can we have your wedding wine?

18
00:00:42.133 --> 00:00:43.533
Miss Tang, say a few words

19
00:00:43.533 --> 00:00:46.466
Okay, I'll let everyone know if there is good news.

20
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:47.966
Take it. Thank you.

21
00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.733
Brother, why did you say that just now?

22
00:00:52.733 --> 00:00:55.066
If I deny this situation

23
00:00:55.166 --> 00:00:56.500
They don't believe it either

24
00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.000
Then you can't either

25
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.066
The board's waiting for you. Go

26
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.200
I don't blame Uncle Luo and the board of directors either.

27
00:01:04.666 --> 00:01:06.000
I offended Lu's

28
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.000
So Lu's people have not paid for the financing.

29
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.500
What does this have to do with you?

30
00:01:11.466 --> 00:01:13.300
It's clearly someone who doesn't believe what they say

31
00:01:13.766 --> 00:01:16.466
If you need money, I can do it, but you can't.

32
00:01:17.133 --> 00:01:20.300
Brother, I have asked you to help me a lot.

33
00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:21.800
I can't invite you anymore.

34
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.200
Okay, don't worry.

35
00:01:24.266 --> 00:01:25.000
You go back first

36
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:25.700
I can so that.

37
00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:26.800
Then I'm leaving.

38
00:01:27.533 --> 00:01:28.900
Isn't it just an investment?

39
00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:29.966
Isn't it the IP?

40
00:01:29.966 --> 00:01:31.633
Friend, you can do it.
