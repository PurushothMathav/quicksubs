00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.900
Master, it's getting late, brother.

2
00:00:06.066 --> 00:00:06.866
senior brother

3
00:00:07.766 --> 00:00:09.433
It was produced by the master today.

4
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.000
Let's go to the master and face each other on the pillar together

5
00:00:20.933 --> 00:00:23.200
Mr. Luo, you have been waiting for 3 hours

6
00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.900
Don't talk about incense, it's time to come back to work, right?

7
00:00:26.966 --> 00:00:27.766
Hey

8
00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:30.866
Yaoyao, be careful

9
00:00:30.933 --> 00:00:31.733
All sleepy

10
00:00:32.333 --> 00:00:33.900
Shouldn't be on

11
00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.033
You gave him a drink

12
00:00:41.366 --> 00:00:42.900
I am happy today.

13
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:44.233
You have a drink with me too

14
00:00:44.966 --> 00:00:45.833
OK

15
00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.033
Mr. Lu, recognize the reality

16
00:00:49.066 --> 00:00:51.000
What you can't do is

17
00:00:51.733 --> 00:00:53.166
Then why are you so wary of me?

18
00:00:53.366 --> 00:00:56.066
I'm afraid I'll take a chance and let me tell you

19
00:00:56.166 --> 00:00:58.166
It's because you saw the eye exchange between me and Tang Yao

20
00:00:58.166 --> 00:00:59.800
It's because you saw the relationship between me and Tang Yao even though

21
00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.000
Wait for this tacit understanding without speaking

22
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.766
It's because of jealousy and you're tired of seeing the sun

23
00:01:05.766 --> 00:01:06.866
Am I right?

24
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:07.800
senior brother

25
00:01:08.866 --> 00:01:10.800
When are you going to talk about it?

26
00:01:10.866 --> 00:01:12.633
I want a drink

27
00:01:12.866 --> 00:01:14.966
Put me down! Put me down!

28
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.566
Long Xue

29
00:01:17.133 --> 00:01:18.400
If you always have someone by your side

30
00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:19.566
Why can't it be me?

31
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.400
It's too late I'm going to bed

32
00:01:23.333 --> 00:01:25.500
You are running away from me

33
00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:27.466
Or afraid of heartache

34
00:01:27.733 --> 00:01:29.500
Dangerous Dangerous

35
00:01:29.966 --> 00:01:31.466
Or are you afraid that I will be in danger?
