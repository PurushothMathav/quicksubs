00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.800
The private video of Lu Gongzi and his new love is leaked out

2
00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:05.466
The scandal a few days ago was self-defeating

3
00:00:05.566 --> 00:00:08.066
As for this new love, no wonder he resigned

4
00:00:08.066 --> 00:00:09.566
It turned out to be climbing a high branch

5
00:00:09.566 --> 00:00:10.466
If it weren't for you?

6
00:00:10.466 --> 00:00:11.900
He is still young today

7
00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:14.300
What about the makeup artist who was passed by Meng cactus?

8
00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.333
Fortunately, the scandal cleared up

9
00:00:17.333 --> 00:00:19.200
Thanks to Lu Enterprises' Assistant Chen

10
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.866
The photos sent are for comparison.

11
00:00:20.866 --> 00:00:22.366
This is completely clarified

12
00:00:22.366 --> 00:00:25.666
However, our relationship with Lu Enterprises has always been good

13
00:00:25.666 --> 00:00:26.900
We and his project

14
00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:29.300
All 8 managers I sent were scolded back

15
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.200
He scolded the manager.

16
00:00:31.266 --> 00:00:32.400
It's okay, Uncle Luo

17
00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:33.800
I'll go find him.

18
00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.700
I didn't bring the contract

19
00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:49.000
Last month, you and the beautiful woman of Down's, do you understand?

20
00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.900
How can there be a way to talk about business as soon as you come up?

21
00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.300
People arrived in person

22
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:54.333
Would you like a drink?

23
00:00:54.333 --> 00:00:58.700
Drink one, drink one, drink one, you feed me

24
00:01:01.366 --> 00:01:05.366
Oh roar hahahaha

25
00:01:05.366 --> 00:01:06.966
Isn't this Miss Tang?

26
00:01:07.066 --> 00:01:10.100
My brother Zhou likes beautiful women the most

27
00:01:10.466 --> 00:01:13.100
You're here, I need a good drink

28
00:01:13.266 --> 00:01:15.266
Stay with Miss Tang this weekend

29
00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:16.900
Come on, beautiful woman

30
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.200
I don't drink. I don't drink

31
00:01:19.266 --> 00:01:22.200
How can I remember that Miss Tang is massive

32
00:01:24.066 --> 00:01:27.000
Although you are young, don't forget how you got here today

33
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.233
Of course I remember.

34
00:01:28.266 --> 00:01:30.166
Miss Tang treats me like a dog

35
00:01:30.166 --> 00:01:31.700
Give it away if you want

36
00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.500
I just came to thank you today

37
00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.300
Hahaha beautiful woman come on hahaha

38
00:01:46.466 --> 00:01:49.100
Miss Tang is too rude to my girlfriend

39
00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.800
Girlfriend Miss Tang has an opinion

40
00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.366
I'm just listening to your request.

41
00:01:53.766 --> 00:01:54.900
Redeem what you want

42
00:01:55.166 --> 00:01:56.466
People are so scared

43
00:01:57.933 --> 00:01:59.466
Little girl is alright

44
00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:00.700
Got it.

45
00:02:01.466 --> 00:02:04.800
Doesn't Mr. Lu just want me to drink? I drink

46
00:02:06.566 --> 00:02:08.000
How boring is drinking alone?

47
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.700
Come, brother, accompany you, let's drink together, you dare to come

48
00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.500
Miss Tang came to talk to me about business today

49
00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:15.466
Should know

50
00:02:15.466 --> 00:02:17.233
There is no such thing as a free lunch

51
00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:18.300
I can help you.

52
00:02:18.733 --> 00:02:19.566
What exchange do you want?

53
00:02:19.766 --> 00:02:20.866
What do you mean?

54
00:02:22.666 --> 00:02:26.100
Treasure project or

55
00:02:29.266 --> 00:02:29.900
Stop.

56
00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:30.933
I see.

57
00:02:30.933 --> 00:02:32.166
I disturbed you.
