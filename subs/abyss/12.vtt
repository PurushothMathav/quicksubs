00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.400
Song Yuchuan, you have no choice

2
00:00:02.933 --> 00:00:03.733
Yaoyao

3
00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:06.100
How can you think of me that way?

4
00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:07.566
I only have you in my heart

5
00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:09.100
The evidence is solid

6
00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:11.366
What else do you have to say?

7
00:00:11.933 --> 00:00:14.866
Because because Emperor Song Yong was wronged

8
00:00:16.133 --> 00:00:17.100
Chen Chuan Producer

One of the members of Song Dang

11
00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:22.166
I don't know.

12
00:00:22.166 --> 00:00:24.966
Producer Chen still has to worry about Miss Tang's personal affairs

13
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.233
You have helped me a lot.

14
00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:31.533
Do you have anything to say?

15
00:00:31.533 --> 00:00:32.333
Mr. Tang

16
00:00:32.466 --> 00:00:34.600
I can't bear to see you misunderstand your stupidity

17
00:00:34.933 --> 00:00:36.833
What are those fragments actually?

18
00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:38.000
It's factual data.

19
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.866
Nonsense

20
00:00:38.866 --> 00:00:40.333
Miss Tang, if you don't believe me

21
00:00:40.333 --> 00:00:42.366
The entire cast can attest

22
00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:44.800
Yangyang, you are recovering from a serious illness

23
00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.666
It's going to be crazy.

24
00:00:47.866 --> 00:00:49.333
I want to see you say it earlier

25
00:00:49.333 --> 00:00:50.933
I have many more films like this

26
00:00:50.933 --> 00:00:52.600
In the car, in bed

27
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.300
I have something else to do

28
00:00:57.066 --> 00:00:57.866
And so forth.

29
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:02.966
Are you sure you want to solve it yourself?

30
00:01:02.966 --> 00:01:04.400
It's too late to regret now

31
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.800

You are the pillow that I miss

34
00:01:21.933 --> 00:01:24.966
I took great pains to marry a daughter

35
00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.566
Now promoted to chairperson of Tang's

36
00:01:28.566 --> 00:01:29.700
How could I possibly

37
00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:30.766
How can you bear

38
00:01:30.866 --> 00:01:33.800
How can you be stupid enough to talk to your soul?

39
00:01:42.933 --> 00:01:44.566
Yaoyao is alright

40
00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.900
Yaoyao
