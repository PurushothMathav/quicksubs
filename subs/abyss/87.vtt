Xu Chuan

2
00:00:05.766 --> 00:00:06.866
Are you a human or a ghost?

3
00:00:07.466 --> 00:00:09.966
I'm a ghost, it's Tang Yao who came to recruit you for your life

4
00:00:09.966 --> 00:00:11.666
He made me do it

5
00:00:11.666 --> 00:00:12.566
I didn't want you to die.

6
00:00:12.566 --> 00:00:13.533
Don't want me to die

7
00:00:13.533 --> 00:00:15.600
But he created the same car accident as Tang Zhengchu

8
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.133
We were wrong from the start.

9
00:00:17.133 --> 00:00:18.400
You shouldn't hurt people

10
00:00:18.533 --> 00:00:19.400
It's all karma

11
00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.466
Everything started to fall apart

12
00:00:21.466 --> 00:00:23.500
I was right, it was Tang Zhengshu who was wrong.

13
00:00:26.066 --> 00:00:27.600
Just based on your line skills

14
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:28.500
How do you get ahead?

15
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.400
If you don't act well, go back to your hometown to farm

16
00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:31.933
Filial piety to me again and again

17
00:00:31.933 --> 00:00:34.000
He trampled on my dignity again and again

18
00:00:34.266 --> 00:00:35.966
I'm a man, not a beast

19
00:00:35.966 --> 00:00:37.533
Just because you want to be the best actor

20
00:00:37.533 --> 00:00:39.400
Just because you want to take this role

21
00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:40.466
Why are you resting?

22
00:00:40.466 --> 00:00:41.733
Everyone thanks to you

23
00:00:41.733 --> 00:00:42.833
Why are you tired?

24
00:00:42.866 --> 00:00:45.266
A stand-in is nothing. You're a stand-in

25
00:00:45.466 --> 00:00:46.733
I am a newcomer.

26
00:00:46.733 --> 00:00:49.500
I'm Tang Dao's pawn to win the movie award

27
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.300
When did he ever value me?

28
00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.700
He deserved it. He deserved it.

29
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.900
You are a pawn

30
00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:56.900
You're a good person.

31
00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:57.666
What about my dad?

32
00:00:57.666 --> 00:00:59.600
What is the road he paved for you?

33
00:01:00.466 --> 00:01:03.266
Take a good look at how much Dangtang has done for you
