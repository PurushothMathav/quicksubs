00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.866
What if I had a way?

2
00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:03.633
I can make the snow ferment

3
00:00:04.333 --> 00:00:05.966
I can make Song Yiqun fall to the bottom

4
00:00:06.466 --> 00:00:08.166
Yaoyao, I can help you.

5
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:09.900
What is the price?

6
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.066
Don't you always talk about the price of doing business with Mr. Lu?

7
00:00:13.866 --> 00:00:15.866
There is no such thing as a free lunch

8
00:00:15.866 --> 00:00:16.900
I can help you.

9
00:00:17.466 --> 00:00:18.266
What exchange do you want?

10
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.666
Treasure Project

11
00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:22.866
Still beautiful

12
00:00:23.333 --> 00:00:25.800
I didn't mean that. What do you mean?

13
00:00:25.866 --> 00:00:27.333
The past is vivid

14
00:00:27.333 --> 00:00:29.466
Don't bother Mr. Lu with these

15
00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.300
I have something to say goodbye to

16
00:00:37.066 --> 00:00:39.433
Mr. Lu, you are my ancestor

17
00:00:40.733 --> 00:00:44.066
Mr. Xu of Orange Entertainment on your phone is looking for you.

18
00:00:44.333 --> 00:00:48.600
Go away, who is so capable and dares to provoke Young Master Lu?

19
00:00:48.733 --> 00:00:50.566
Don't say bro I didn't tell you

20
00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.466
The corner of the Golden Tower is very beautiful tonight

21
00:00:53.466 --> 00:00:57.266
Come on, make a wish and let me say it again

22
00:00:58.900 --> 00:00:59.700
Hey

23
00:01:01.366 --> 00:01:04.266
Who is this?

24
00:01:04.266 --> 00:01:08.300
He doesn't understand that we play cheers

25
00:01:08.366 --> 00:01:09.433
Ooh.

26
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:10.800
Ha ha.

27
00:01:11.533 --> 00:01:12.333
come

28
00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.633
What? Miss Tang went to the Jinlou?

29
00:01:15.866 --> 00:01:17.566
Mr. Xu is a famous romantic king treasury

30
00:01:17.566 --> 00:01:20.066
Isn't this a sheep into a tiger's mouth?

31
00:01:20.933 --> 00:01:23.066
Mr. Lu actually went to beg Xu Yanshan

32
00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:25.966
Hey, Mr. Deer
