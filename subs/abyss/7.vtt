00:00:00.966 --> 00:00:02.700
Sissy except for that lunatic

2
00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.333
Who else would put Wulin 2 in the daily chemical industry?

3
00:00:04.333 --> 00:00:06.866
Sent to the hospital at night because of sticking

4
00:00:06.866 --> 00:00:08.466
Being chased by paparazzi

5
00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:09.633
This kind of thing

6
00:00:09.733 --> 00:00:12.266
It will be twisted online in less than half an hour.

7
00:00:12.533 --> 00:00:14.900
Okay, fresh, don't be angry.

8
00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:16.833
Not angry not angry

9
00:00:17.133 --> 00:00:20.000
We betrayed together, you are crazy Song Yuchuan

10
00:00:20.166 --> 00:00:22.366
Do you know what these sacred symbols stand for?

11
00:00:23.133 --> 00:00:26.166
On behalf of the Best Actor and Huadan, they gave it to the cat.

12
00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:30.100
How come?

13
00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:31.233
What about my revelations?

14
00:00:32.933 --> 00:00:34.200
How could this be?

15
00:00:35.166 --> 00:00:36.866
Money can make a ghost run the mill

16
00:00:37.366 --> 00:00:41.600
Don't worry, nothing will be true tomorrow.

17
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:42.366
Tomorrow

18
00:00:42.366 --> 00:00:44.900
I will hold a radio conference in the name of Tang Yao

19
00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:46.900
Master more Tang's at that time

20
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.000
Squeeze Tang Yao to death

21
00:00:48.733 --> 00:00:50.666
Isn't it equivalent to pinching an ant to death?

22
00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.066
But most of those sensible people are really Tang Yao.

23
00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:58.866
What if it is

24
00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.000
They gave it to me themselves

25
00:01:02.466 --> 00:01:05.266
This time I'm going to take my colleague

26
00:01:05.666 --> 00:01:07.600
Hold it firmly in your hand

27
00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:21.800
Sutamagawa

28
00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.400
You actually made fake equity to let the book read

29
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.000
Hello

30
00:01:32.466 --> 00:01:33.266
Lu Xue

31
00:01:33.933 --> 00:01:36.766
You said before that you would help me anytime

32
00:01:36.766 --> 00:01:38.800
Does it still count? Of course

33
00:01:46.166 --> 00:01:47.933
Yaoyao, where's my candy?

34
00:01:47.933 --> 00:01:49.066
What are you doing here?

35
00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:49.933
I have a lot of sugar

36
00:01:49.933 --> 00:01:51.066
The conference is about to start

37
00:01:51.066 --> 00:01:51.966
Can you hurry up?

38
00:01:51.966 --> 00:01:54.200
Tangyao, did you take my candy?

39
00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.833
You give me back my candy

40
00:01:56.066 --> 00:01:57.266
Where's my candy?

41
00:01:57.866 --> 00:01:59.800
Sugar is here

42
00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:07.400
So disgusting

43
00:02:09.166 --> 00:02:10.066
Let's go!

44
00:02:12.066 --> 00:02:14.466
You said shareholders could see him like this

45
00:02:14.866 --> 00:02:16.033
Isn't it?

46
00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:17.566
surprise

47
00:02:19.333 --> 00:02:22.500
Song Yuchuan, let's go to the board together like this

48
00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.800
Then we go to hell together
