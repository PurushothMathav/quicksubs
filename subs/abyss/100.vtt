00:00:00.933 --> 00:00:03.466
Are you kidding me if he marries you?

2
00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:05.766
Who would marry their father's killer?

3
00:00:05.933 --> 00:00:07.166
Father killer

4
00:00:07.166 --> 00:00:08.633
I went to find Song Yu Chuan

5
00:00:08.966 --> 00:00:10.266
Here are the contributions of Song Yuchuan

6
00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:13.366
Is it you because Tang Zhengchu rebels against the United States?

7
00:00:13.766 --> 00:00:14.800
hold a grudge

8
00:00:15.166 --> 00:00:17.900
You lured Song Yuchuan into a car accident

9
00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:20.633
It was also you who indirectly killed Tang Yao's father

10
00:00:21.166 --> 00:00:23.900
A murderer's son can count

11
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.166
A good murderer's words don't count

12
00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.100
Then I want to kiss you.

13
00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:30.000
Lu Xuan

14
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.266
I will bear with you alone

15
00:00:32.266 --> 00:00:33.666
Today is my wedding

16
00:00:33.666 --> 00:00:36.233
You can't be presumptuous, can you?

17
00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:43.300
Your hand

18
00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:44.866
Is it really useless?

19
00:00:47.333 --> 00:00:48.966
No, it doesn't.

20
00:00:49.733 --> 00:00:51.700
Sister, I am really hurt

21
00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:53.233
Is it hurt for me?

22
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.300
Or did you smash it yourself?

23
00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:57.700
You never really believed in me

24
00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:59.000
I want to believe you

25
00:00:59.166 --> 00:01:01.033
But I trust my eyes more

26
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.466
So the wedding will go on as usual tomorrow, right?

27
00:01:18.266 --> 00:01:19.400
Murderer's words

28
00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:21.633
How can you believe

29
00:01:22.166 --> 00:01:22.966
No.

30
00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:24.400
Yaoyao

31
00:01:25.766 --> 00:01:27.400
Can you give me another chance?

32
00:01:30.766 --> 00:01:33.233
Why? Because I love you.

33
00:01:36.133 --> 00:01:36.966
Hahaha

34
00:01:38.566 --> 00:01:39.366
Ah!

35
00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.400
Because you love me

36
00:01:43.966 --> 00:01:45.233
Killed my father

37
00:01:45.533 --> 00:01:47.066
Because you love me

38
00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.066
So you are useless

39
00:01:49.066 --> 00:01:51.266
Quit again to lead him

40
00:01:51.266 --> 00:01:52.400
You say you love me

41
00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:53.733
It's your plan

42
00:01:53.733 --> 00:01:54.833
Deceive everywhere

43
00:01:55.166 --> 00:01:57.800
Tang Yuyao must not have such love
