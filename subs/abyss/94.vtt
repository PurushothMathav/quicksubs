00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:05.900
Yaoyao

2
00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:07.200
Yaoyao

3
00:00:20.466 --> 00:00:22.000
Hey, is there anyone else in Japan?

4
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.066
Such a big fire

5
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.333
Isn't this an abandoned warehouse?

6
00:00:24.333 --> 00:00:25.366
Why is it on fire?

7
00:00:25.366 --> 00:00:27.933
Someone in here would be dead long ago, oh my god

8
00:00:27.933 --> 00:00:29.100
Live less

9
00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:30.800
That's too bad.

10
00:00:30.866 --> 00:00:31.833
Don't worry.

11
00:00:32.366 --> 00:00:33.166
Don't worry.

12
00:00:35.333 --> 00:00:36.800
I'm going to keep doing it

13
00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:37.600
You are not in danger

14
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.333
You let me go

15
00:00:39.333 --> 00:00:40.966
I also lived together, I was in danger

16
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.466
Danger, I'm still inside

17
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:44.700
You let me go

18
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.766
I hate you. I hate you.

19
00:00:55.133 --> 00:00:55.933
senior brother

20
00:00:57.266 --> 00:00:59.833
Brother, are you all right?

21
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.433
Why is that?

22
00:01:05.733 --> 00:01:06.833
Anybody?

23
00:01:11.333 --> 00:01:12.133
Ah!

24
00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:21.033
He's leaving again.

25
00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:22.700
My deadline this time

26
00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:24.800
I don't know.

27
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.233
And you know what?

28
00:01:26.366 --> 00:01:29.000
The boy was in the piano room when I met him

29
00:01:29.066 --> 00:01:31.900
He actually said he was working part-time

30
00:01:32.266 --> 00:01:33.500
Can you believe it?

31
00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.366
He actually earned his own money to go to college

32
00:01:35.533 --> 00:01:37.100
His name is Song Yuchuan

33
00:01:37.166 --> 00:01:38.466
Such a beautiful boy

34
00:01:38.466 --> 00:01:41.566
Tommy, um, I have something to tell you.

35
00:01:41.566 --> 00:01:43.033
You have someone you like too

36
00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:45.900
I'm going to Switzerland

37
00:01:46.566 --> 00:01:48.700
And I wish you happiness.

38
00:01:56.333 --> 00:01:58.166
He holds the power of life and death

39
00:01:58.466 --> 00:02:01.233
You can only be seen in newspapers, news, business magazines

40
00:02:01.266 --> 00:02:03.400
I used to think that was the most distant sentence

41
00:02:03.766 --> 00:02:05.000
This is the moment.

42
00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:06.900
I will accompany you.

43
00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:09.466
I will always be with you.
