00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:02.200
Miss Tang, you are discharged from the hospital.

2
00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:04.100
Your father went out and died because of it

3
00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:05.000
How do you feel?

4
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:05.200
Right.

5
00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.600
Miss Tang, did you hear that you had a miscarriage? What about the father of the child?

6
00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.266
The netizens said that you gave birth to me and I ignored you.

7
00:00:09.266 --> 00:00:10.566
The car accident is purely a rainstorm

8
00:00:10.566 --> 00:00:11.900
Is there anything you want to say?

9
00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:13.533
Some people say that you are for Luo Qun and Tang Consortium

10
00:00:13.533 --> 00:00:14.833
Orchestrated a car accident

11
00:00:14.866 --> 00:00:15.666
What do you have to say?

12
00:00:15.666 --> 00:00:17.200
Miss Tang, tell me

13
00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:18.700
Tell me about it. Tell me about it.

14
00:00:18.766 --> 00:00:19.600
Go away

15
00:00:20.133 --> 00:00:21.366
You are so bullying

16
00:00:21.366 --> 00:00:22.700
Celebrity Dream Fairy

17
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:23.966
I heard earlier that he was going to quarrel with the tower

18
00:00:23.966 --> 00:00:25.966
If my girlfriend doesn't leave, I'll call the police

19
00:00:28.366 --> 00:00:29.833
What you go

20
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.466
Yaoyao, how are you?

21
00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:36.400
stupid

22
00:00:37.133 --> 00:00:37.933
stupid

23
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.200
Let's leave Jingzhou, I'm afraid.

24
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.966
Don't say anything, I'm the best actor

25
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.666
But I don't want you to be the best actor

26
00:00:46.866 --> 00:00:49.100
I just want to live an ordinary life

27
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.800
Let's be an ordinary couple

28
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.300
Okay? Are you crazy?

29
00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.600
Ok, I'll be with you later.

30
00:00:57.333 --> 00:00:58.833
Get in the car first, okay?

31
00:01:04.766 --> 00:01:07.000
Maybe it's just not enough.

32
00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.666
Go eat for a week

33
00:01:13.666 --> 00:01:15.600
He's a real lunatic.

34
00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.833
Then his property will be ours

35
00:01:22.566 --> 00:01:23.366
Yaoyao

36
00:01:26.166 --> 00:01:27.066
Give you sugar

37
00:01:27.766 --> 00:01:30.200
What the hell did we feed you?

38
00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:31.700
Yaoyao

39
00:01:36.333 --> 00:01:37.766
Yaoyao is alright

40
00:01:37.766 --> 00:01:39.233
You'll wake up soon.
