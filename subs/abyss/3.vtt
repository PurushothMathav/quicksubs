00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.800
Dad, it's all my fault

2
00:00:07.866 --> 00:00:09.700
It's because I was in a car accident

3
00:00:09.866 --> 00:00:12.600
I should be damned. I should be damned.

4
00:00:12.733 --> 00:00:14.100
It's all my fault

5
00:00:14.466 --> 00:00:17.433
What should I do after you leave?

6
00:00:20.533 --> 00:00:22.866
Yaoyao's father has left

7
00:00:23.066 --> 00:00:25.966
Why don't you think about what to do with Down Pictures?

8
00:00:26.066 --> 00:00:27.766
It was Dad's life's work

9
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.166
You can't just watch him fall apart, can you?

10
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.266
Hand over a capable person as soon as possible

11
00:00:34.266 --> 00:00:35.100
teacher

12
00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:40.666
My dad made you the only reporter for Down's

13
00:00:40.666 --> 00:00:41.666
You forgot

14
00:00:42.566 --> 00:00:43.900
To get down

15
00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:45.233
The Tang Dynasty must be defeated

16
00:00:50.666 --> 00:00:51.700
My child

17
00:00:52.333 --> 00:00:53.233
child

18
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.133
Your child

19
00:00:56.133 --> 00:00:57.633
This is my baby.

20
00:00:58.133 --> 00:00:59.400
Is it me who is pregnant?

21
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:00.733
I gave birth to my child.

22
00:01:00.733 --> 00:01:03.300
What is your child?

23
00:01:03.533 --> 00:01:04.633
What about my child?

24
00:01:05.066 --> 00:01:06.733
Where did you hide my child?

25
00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:07.800
Where's my baby?

26
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:08.800
You lunatic

27
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.366
Your child has long been killed by you

28
00:01:10.366 --> 00:01:13.366
You died when you were in a car accident.

29
00:01:13.366 --> 00:01:14.600
Don't you know?

30
00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:16.066
And your dad.

31
00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.866
Your father died because of you

32
00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:22.000
If he had died long ago

33
00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.100
I would have gone to pay for their lives long ago

34
00:01:26.333 --> 00:01:27.700
I miss my father and son

35
00:01:28.866 --> 00:01:30.266
Killed my judge

36
00:01:30.333 --> 00:01:32.233
Just you go away

37
00:01:33.466 --> 00:01:35.033
It's my man's son

38
00:01:35.333 --> 00:01:36.333
I should die

39
00:01:36.333 --> 00:01:37.800
Yaoyao Yaoyao I should die

40
00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.100
Yaoyao, I should have died a long time ago

41
00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.500
Yaoyao, watch over me, watch over me

42
00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:49.333
You are a child without a mother

43
00:01:49.333 --> 00:01:51.300
Go away I don't want to play with you

44
00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:54.000
You go away, I don't allow you to bully girls

45
00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.100
Big fat man big head

46
00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.100
I'll just mind your own business.

47
00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:09.233
Hahahahahaha

48
00:02:15.666 --> 00:02:17.166
How are you going to thank me?

49
00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.833
I want to kill

50
00:02:23.766 --> 00:02:24.966
Do you understand?

51
00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.633
Don't worry, I've arranged everything.
