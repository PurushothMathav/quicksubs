00:00:08.133 --> 00:00:10.466
This place is about emotion

2
00:00:10.466 --> 00:00:12.533
Jade Chuan's lines still need to be improved

3
00:00:12.533 --> 00:00:15.466
Urge him to practice.

4
00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:20.366
Hey, I don't know how this kid is practicing.

5
00:00:20.366 --> 00:00:22.400
Mr. Wang, your eyes are not good

6
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.300
I'll just talk to Sun Yuchuan

7
00:00:25.866 --> 00:00:28.200
That won't work. Strict teachers produce excellent apprentices

8
00:00:28.333 --> 00:00:30.300
I'm still counting on him to win the best actor's title

9
00:00:32.533 --> 00:00:33.566
I don't believe it.

10
00:00:33.666 --> 00:00:34.600
I don't believe it.

11
00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.400
Surrender the fishing boat

12
00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:37.766
You're with them

13
00:00:37.766 --> 00:00:40.633
That car was clearly returned as a fake.

14
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.800
And so forth.

15
00:00:51.933 --> 00:00:53.300
If it wasn't for hitting a tree on purpose

16
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.200
If it weren't for the supervision, he would not only be stupid

17
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.600
Will you jump out and recognize yourself?

18
00:00:58.266 --> 00:00:59.866
The divorce cooling-off period is about to expire

19
00:00:59.933 --> 00:01:02.200
You don't want to see me with nothing, do you?

20
00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.800
You're dead, Don asks for no evidence

21
00:01:05.566 --> 00:01:06.733
Years of director experience

22
00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:09.566
I didn't expect that one day I would come to the scene to send the best actor

23
00:01:10.266 --> 00:01:11.700
The police will be here soon.

24
00:01:12.533 --> 00:01:13.500
Really?

25
00:01:22.533 --> 00:01:25.466
Why did Tangyuan save me?

26
00:01:26.166 --> 00:01:27.200
Sorry.

27
00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.700
I was wrong. I'm willing to put you on the stand

28
00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.433
I promise you anything as long as you can forgive me.

29
00:01:34.066 --> 00:01:36.066
You're just trying to make your conscience feel better

30
00:01:36.066 --> 00:01:37.066
You're not helping me.

31
00:01:37.066 --> 00:01:38.366
You're helping yourself.

32
00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.366
In the future, Yangyang will become a colleague and a big boss

33
00:01:40.366 --> 00:01:41.333
I want to be a badass

34
00:01:41.333 --> 00:01:42.433
Of course!

35
00:01:42.566 --> 00:01:43.600
That day

36
00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.266
I want to be the best boss

37
00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:46.600
Cover my sister
