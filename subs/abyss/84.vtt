00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:18.500
Lu Xue I

2
00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:19.533
I can't always say

3
00:00:19.533 --> 00:00:21.300
I deliberately waited for him to fall asleep before sneaking out

4
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:22.600
I know what you're doing here

5
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.600
I know time is running out and I can't stop you

6
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:25.666
So I'm going to face it with you

7
00:00:25.666 --> 00:00:26.900
You take revenge and I will accompany you

8
00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:29.566
You are in danger, I protect you, I cheer you on

9
00:00:37.933 --> 00:00:39.466
Isn't that Mr. Lu and Miss Tang?

10
00:00:39.466 --> 00:00:40.466
Two people are so compatible

11
00:00:40.466 --> 00:00:42.066
Miss Tang is shining today

12
00:00:42.066 --> 00:00:42.966
It seems

13
00:00:42.966 --> 00:00:45.300
It's him who votes for the glamour star tonight

14
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:45.666
OK

15
00:00:45.666 --> 00:00:48.100
I heard the Glamour Star award is a luxury car.

16
00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:49.300
Don't talk nonsense

17
00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.500
The lady and the pretty woman around Mr. Lu

18
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:52.666
Are you still short of a car?

19
00:00:55.866 --> 00:00:58.433
Do you want the road to be not far? Of course

20
00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.866
Miss Meng, have you ever considered

21
00:01:12.866 --> 00:01:14.500
Mr. Song is using you

22
00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.100
He has me in his heart

23
00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:17.966
He just has a bad temper, doesn't he?

24
00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:19.066
Or else?

25
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.233
Why does he only use me and not others?

26
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.533
How many wheels can be produced after a power outage for 10 minutes?

27
00:01:35.533 --> 00:01:36.833
That's curious.
