00:00:02.766 --> 00:00:03.666
That's enough!

2
00:00:04.966 --> 00:00:06.233
What I mean is...

3
00:00:06.766 --> 00:00:08.100
Fritters with Coffee

4
00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:09.633
I like them all.

5
00:00:10.133 --> 00:00:10.933
Ah!

6
00:00:11.333 --> 00:00:13.566
Ha churros with coffee

7
00:00:13.566 --> 00:00:15.266
So tight and relaxed

8
00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.666
The relaxation of the alcoholic

9
00:00:19.733 --> 00:00:21.000
One tight and one loose

10
00:00:21.266 --> 00:00:23.566
Chen Sheng, you are such a genius

11
00:00:23.866 --> 00:00:28.500
I'm going to let them bite the dog

12
00:00:28.566 --> 00:00:29.466
What do you mean?

13
00:00:29.733 --> 00:00:31.066
How do you do that?

14
00:00:31.133 --> 00:00:34.000
I want Song Yuchuan and Lu Xianxian to bite the dog

15
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:34.900
Let's do it.

16
00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:36.733
I want advertising sponsorship

17
00:00:36.733 --> 00:00:39.966
Give him all the movies and TV dramas suitable for Mengxianxian

18
00:00:39.966 --> 00:00:41.066
Don't ask why

19
00:00:41.066 --> 00:00:43.566
My new movie is for that guy

20
00:00:43.566 --> 00:00:45.600
Yes, it is the opposite of Best Actor Song

21
00:00:45.866 --> 00:00:47.266
It's him I'm running from.

22
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.366
That role was mine

23
00:00:52.366 --> 00:00:53.333
Why should he give it to me?

24
00:00:53.333 --> 00:00:55.266
Nemesis, be quiet

25
00:00:55.266 --> 00:00:56.666
What if it is photographed?

26
00:00:57.766 --> 00:00:59.233
I'm still afraid of being photographed.

27
00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:00.733
I think you are afraid

28
00:01:00.733 --> 00:01:02.033
What are you talking about?

29
00:01:03.466 --> 00:01:05.400
I heard you're dating a lot now

30
00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.066
It's rare to have time to see me

31
00:01:08.166 --> 00:01:09.233
Song stupid

32
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.333
Are you speaking human language?

33
00:01:11.333 --> 00:01:13.666
What you say is not human words, are you doing personnel?

34
00:01:13.666 --> 00:01:14.666
Oh, pregnant.

35
00:01:14.933 --> 00:01:16.100
eyeball

36
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.400
Step on me

37
00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.966
Are you drinking human blood steamed buns?

38
00:01:21.566 --> 00:01:24.066
I see you are with Tang Yao

39
00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:25.633
Golden dog molecule

40
00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:27.500
You think of me like that?

41
00:01:29.666 --> 00:01:31.066
Get out of here

42
00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.900
What do you want to do with the soup?

43
00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:37.800
Don't worry.

44
00:01:38.366 --> 00:01:39.900
To negotiate a deal with you

45
00:01:39.933 --> 00:01:41.400
I don't have a deal to talk to you about

46
00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:43.500
Death Report
