00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:10.233
classmate

2
00:00:10.533 --> 00:00:13.800
Is this the first water in romance novels?

3
00:00:20.966 --> 00:00:22.966
Hello Miss Tang

4
00:00:22.966 --> 00:00:24.100
Can't imagine

5
00:00:24.133 --> 00:00:26.133
Your beloved brother is in my hands

6
00:00:26.133 --> 00:00:27.266
I don't want him to die

7
00:00:27.333 --> 00:00:29.033
Come to the west warehouse immediately

8
00:00:30.266 --> 00:00:31.566
Sorry Tang You

9
00:00:31.566 --> 00:00:32.566
So far

10
00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.866
I still want to make it clear to you in person

11
00:00:38.133 --> 00:00:40.233
It's me. Where's he going?

12
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.000
Dude, you can't do this

13
00:00:48.166 --> 00:00:50.466
We mean making money without killing people

14
00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:51.933
Can you hear us?

15
00:00:51.933 --> 00:00:54.066
Hey hey go

16
00:00:55.533 --> 00:00:56.633
Take that money

17
00:00:56.766 --> 00:00:57.866
Get out of here

18
00:00:58.933 --> 00:01:00.633
Go go go go

19
00:01:00.966 --> 00:01:02.500
Even if the world is on fire

20
00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:04.266
I stand up alone

21
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.666
Just like Tang Zhengchu abandoned me

22
00:01:07.666 --> 00:01:09.966
Why should he give you all his property as a shot?

23
00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:11.166
Why should he

24
00:01:11.466 --> 00:01:12.566
Why should he

25
00:01:12.566 --> 00:01:14.266
I'm nothing compared to him

26
00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:15.300
You say

27
00:01:16.066 --> 00:01:17.566
Nothing compares to him

28
00:01:19.866 --> 00:01:21.500
Why can't you hurt him?

29
00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.366
Do you want to use me to coerce Tang Yao?

30
00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:28.833
I just wanted to kill someone.

31
00:01:28.866 --> 00:01:31.766
I want to kill everyone around Tang Yao

32
00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:34.200
I originally wanted to kill Lu Xuan today

33
00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.466
Then kill you halfway

34
00:01:36.533 --> 00:01:38.033
Let them both fly

35
00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.033
Just a pathetic

36
00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.100
Who lives together and flies together? You are talking nonsense.

37
00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.400
How is that possible?

38
00:01:52.933 --> 00:01:54.466
Just because you're an idiot

39
00:01:54.466 --> 00:01:57.200
Just because you are the one who comes from the ravine

40
00:01:58.266 --> 00:01:59.866
Delusions go to the sky

41
00:02:00.666 --> 00:02:02.066
Just because you are delusional

42
00:02:02.066 --> 00:02:04.966
Wishful thinking is never down to earth

43
00:02:05.466 --> 00:02:06.266
How is that possible?

44
00:02:07.266 --> 00:02:08.800
How could you possibly be like him?

45
00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:11.833
How is that possible, hahaha?

46
00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.966
Hahaha what?
