00:00:00.533 --> 00:00:02.800
Does the man in your dreams treat you like this?

2
00:00:08.866 --> 00:00:10.066
If you don't want him to see you

3
00:00:10.066 --> 00:00:11.566
So distracted

4
00:00:12.766 --> 00:00:13.566
And

5
00:00:14.166 --> 00:00:16.366
You said you weren't free

6
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.000
Enrollment I did it on purpose

7
00:00:20.733 --> 00:00:22.933
Brother, I'm sorry.

8
00:00:22.933 --> 00:00:24.433
I have something to do temporarily today.

9
00:00:24.466 --> 00:00:26.033
Or next time

10
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.300
Du Xue, how can you do this?

11
00:00:32.933 --> 00:00:34.833
Why not?

12
00:00:34.933 --> 00:00:37.000
Don't you like someone else the most?

13
00:00:40.966 --> 00:00:42.866
The entertainment industry has another child

14
00:00:42.866 --> 00:00:44.900
The father of the child remains a mystery

15
00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:46.300
The topic continues to escalate

16
00:00:46.366 --> 00:00:48.566
Hundreds of millions of internet users have participated in the voting

17
00:00:48.566 --> 00:00:49.900
18 headlines

18
00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:51.766
It can be said that you take things to ferment

19
00:00:51.766 --> 00:00:56.166
Of course, so guess what your back hand is?

20
00:00:57.666 --> 00:01:00.133
Are you sure you want to sell it?

21
00:01:00.133 --> 00:01:02.500
I really enjoy Miss Tang's embrace

22
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.833
But there are more important things to do now

23
00:01:07.133 --> 00:01:07.966
Change clothes

24
00:01:07.966 --> 00:01:08.966
Go somewhere else

25
00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.366
It's not a bucket, it's about to be delivered.

26
00:01:11.366 --> 00:01:12.866
Where else to go?
