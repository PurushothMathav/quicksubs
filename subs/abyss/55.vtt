00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:01.566
Announce divestment

2
00:00:01.566 --> 00:00:03.133
What divestment?

3
00:00:03.133 --> 00:00:04.666
The divestment contract is here

4
00:00:04.933 --> 00:00:07.500
Clear black and white

5
00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:08.766
Is there a prize?

6
00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:10.100
What happened to Yaoyao?

7
00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:12.400
Haven't Lu Enterprises and Tang Enterprises always been good friends?

8
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.966
If this is a divestment, Tang's Yingye will lose everything

9
00:00:14.966 --> 00:00:16.400
Miss Tang, give us an explanation

10
00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.166
Give us an account give us an account

11
00:00:18.166 --> 00:00:21.266
I don't believe that Lu Enterprises will not treat Tang Enterprises like this

12
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.400
Contract me sorry

13
00:00:25.166 --> 00:00:28.100
Someone to help Tang pay off

14
00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:30.566
I see who dares

15
00:00:31.266 --> 00:00:35.166
Slowly scared belly with Miss Tang Song Yuchuan

16
00:00:35.333 --> 00:00:36.566
You are going too far.

17
00:00:36.733 --> 00:00:40.400
Yaoyao, I'm helping you.

18
00:00:40.533 --> 00:00:43.800
Hurry up and help pack up.

19
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.033
Can't take care of him

20
00:00:47.333 --> 00:00:48.300
All waste

21
00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:50.966
Who dares to impersonate my dew?

22
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.500
Counterfeit Mr. Lu

23
00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:54.400
Come

24
00:00:55.133 --> 00:00:57.300
Take this fake Lu's outdated actor

25
00:00:57.533 --> 00:00:58.600
Get it for me

26
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.566
Mr. Lu, you signed the contract yourself

27
00:01:02.766 --> 00:01:05.066
Yes, I am certified.

28
00:01:05.066 --> 00:01:08.200
Then why is there no Lu seal on this contract?

29
00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:09.400
No seal.

30
00:01:10.966 --> 00:01:12.866
That's pitiful.

31
00:01:13.666 --> 00:01:14.466
naive
