00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.500
Of course, it's a pain to play with him

2
00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:08.800
I don't mind using tactics against Yaoyao's enemies

3
00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.766
I don't mind getting hurt either

4
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:16.666
How do you want to do it?

5
00:00:16.666 --> 00:00:18.500
You said that in the face of a bigger disease

6
00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:19.400
More opportunities for people

7
00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.500
How long can Mr. Meng and Song Yuchuan last?

8
00:00:25.933 --> 00:00:29.900
What parent-child variety show are you feeding?

9
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:30.866
I'll take it.

10
00:00:32.133 --> 00:00:35.133
Crazy, you dare to come in the parent-child show

11
00:00:35.133 --> 00:00:36.100
You are a flower

12
00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:37.333
Do you still want to accompany your wife in the future?

13
00:00:37.333 --> 00:00:39.100
Are you trying to starve my customers to death?

14
00:00:39.966 --> 00:00:41.066
Drop my phone

15
00:00:41.066 --> 00:00:42.400
I fought with you

16
00:00:42.466 --> 00:00:44.866
It's good to fight so soon

17
00:00:47.766 --> 00:00:49.566
What are you doing?

18
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.466
What can I do?

19
00:00:52.733 --> 00:00:55.566
Yaoyao, help me get the seasoning.

20
00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:59.066
I can do that too

21
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.266
The apron is open, help me remember it.

22
00:01:02.966 --> 00:01:03.966
I got it.

23
00:01:09.566 --> 00:01:10.500
Miss Tang

24
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.066
I understand. It's okay.

25
00:01:14.066 --> 00:01:16.500
You three live your life better than anything else

26
00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:19.100
Wait for me in the car first

27
00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.900
Hey

28
00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:21.666
By the way, Miss Tang

29
00:01:21.666 --> 00:01:24.500
S-level parent-child project throws an olive branch to Mengxianxian

30
00:01:25.266 --> 00:01:26.700
On the contrary

31
00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.766
There is no sound from Song Yuchuan

32
00:01:28.766 --> 00:01:30.866
Even the chat ads that were endorsed before

33
00:01:30.866 --> 00:01:31.900
The TVs are all off the shelves.

34
00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:34.533
Even nothing on the internet entry

35
00:01:34.533 --> 00:01:35.900
This guy just disappeared.

36
00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:38.766
It's like, it's like

37
00:01:39.066 --> 00:01:40.566
Completely forgotten by the times
