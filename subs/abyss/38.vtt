1
00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:01.633
Mr. Lu is looking for me

2
00:00:01.866 --> 00:00:03.766
Why what why

3
00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:06.233
Why return to China?

4
00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:08.400
Why accompany Cai Yaoyao

5
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.800
Why did you shoot Song Yuchuan with him?

6
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:13.700
Or do you want to know

7
00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:16.000
Why would I help him block that blow?

8
00:00:16.466 --> 00:00:17.400
Or

9
00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:21.366
Why did I hold him tightly in my arms?

10
00:00:21.366 --> 00:00:22.733
I don't mind if you tell me everything.

11
00:00:22.733 --> 00:00:24.633
Mr. Lu is so curious

12
00:00:24.733 --> 00:00:26.166
I don't know, I think

13
00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.666
You have ulterior motives for my junior sister

14
00:00:28.666 --> 00:00:30.966
What about you? I wish Galaxy

15
00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:33.733
Did you tell him it wasn't unreasonable?

16
00:00:33.733 --> 00:00:34.866
Three years ago.

17
00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.100
For a better future

18
00:00:37.466 --> 00:00:39.266
In the name of Hollywood directors

19
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.066
For the world to see

20
00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:43.700
I left Jingzhou

21
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.400
Let him marry Song Yuchuan

22
00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.300
This is the most painful part of my life

23
00:00:48.766 --> 00:00:50.800
And you, Lu Xuan

24
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:52.500
You are his childhood

25
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.700
You stay by his side with your life of protection

26
00:00:54.966 --> 00:00:57.266
But let him be in such a situation step by step

27
00:00:57.266 --> 00:00:59.366
How dare you come and question me now

28
00:01:00.466 --> 00:01:02.133
Why do you regret it?

29
00:01:02.133 --> 00:01:04.800
One regret wants to erase everything

30
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.666
I'm back now Lu Xun

31
00:01:07.966 --> 00:01:09.400
You don't have a chance.

32
00:01:09.766 --> 00:01:11.033
Is it? Yes

33
00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:12.366
How to relieve worries

34
00:01:14.066 --> 00:01:15.866
Ah brother

35
00:01:15.866 --> 00:01:16.666
Oh, dear.

36
00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:18.866
Brother, are you alright?

37
00:01:19.066 --> 00:01:20.500
I'll help you up, what's the hurry?

38
00:01:20.933 --> 00:01:23.166
It's okay to sweat so much

39
00:01:23.566 --> 00:01:25.066
How distressed my brother is when he sees it

40
00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:26.166
There we go.

41
00:01:26.733 --> 00:01:28.300
Hello please borrow

42
00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:31.300
Yaoyao

43
00:01:34.133 --> 00:01:36.066
Mr. Lu, I'm very busy right now

44
00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.000
Busy delivering porridge and soup to other men, right?

45
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.333
If I want to talk to you about Song Yuchuan

46
00:01:39.333 --> 00:01:40.266
What do you want to say?

47
00:01:40.266 --> 00:01:41.666
That live broadcast marketing is limited.

48
00:01:41.933 --> 00:01:43.500
He claimed to be the information

49
00:01:43.533 --> 00:01:45.166
Now even with all the online abuse

50
00:01:45.166 --> 00:01:46.700
It's definitely not evidence of murder

51
00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.400
Then don't work hard

52
00:01:48.733 --> 00:01:50.066
What if I had a way?
