1
00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:01.766
Not as good as my father

2
00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:03.200
Yaoyao has no wind

3
00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:05.400
Is this a game?

4
00:00:05.533 --> 00:00:07.600
Good good good hahaha

5
00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:10.666
No, you said you would help me anytime

6
00:00:10.666 --> 00:00:11.800
Does it still count?

7
00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:15.833
Tang You told me that life counts, do you believe it?

8
00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:17.066
Mr. Lu

9
00:00:17.066 --> 00:00:19.500
Have you always been disinterested in the Kyoto Chamber of Commerce?

10
00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:21.700
How many times have you been urged at home to take over?

11
00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:23.766
You rejected it, why now?

12
00:00:24.066 --> 00:00:24.900
Interested now

13
00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.833
You're interested in the chairpersonship.

14
00:00:26.966 --> 00:00:28.433
Or some people?

15
00:00:28.533 --> 00:00:29.333
Tang Yao

16
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.166
Are you kidding me?

17
00:00:31.166 --> 00:00:33.966
Why am I fine now?

18
00:00:33.966 --> 00:00:35.233
You are disappointed

19
00:00:35.966 --> 00:00:36.766
Yaoyao

20
00:00:37.266 --> 00:00:38.266
How come?

21
00:00:38.266 --> 00:00:40.600
It's too late for me to be happy that you're psychotic

22
00:00:40.733 --> 00:00:41.633
But

23
00:00:42.366 --> 00:00:45.500
I said, what should sensible immortals do?

24
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.966
Yaoyao is playing our master flower today

25
00:00:48.866 --> 00:00:53.000
Tomorrow, Yaoyao, we still have to take this medicine

26
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.333
What else to eat

27
00:00:54.333 --> 00:00:55.900
Neuropathy as the boss

28
00:00:56.266 --> 00:00:57.333
It's hilarious

29
00:00:57.333 --> 00:00:58.966
It's real to hit people

30
00:00:58.966 --> 00:01:01.000
Who knows if there will be a board meeting tomorrow?

31
00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.700
Uncle Luo, you are the pillar of our Tang enterprise

32
00:01:03.766 --> 00:01:04.966
Always decided

33
00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:09.566
Yaoyao's matter today is indeed correct

34
00:01:09.666 --> 00:01:12.233
Uncle Luo, it's because of me
