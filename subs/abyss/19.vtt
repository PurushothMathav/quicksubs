00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:03.566
The fans of this actor are bound to the fans of Huadan

2
00:00:03.566 --> 00:00:05.300
Tamagawa and Miss Tang are Yin Hui

3
00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:07.633
He Xian Xian is a serious CP

4
00:00:07.733 --> 00:00:09.533
Advertisements, interviews, endorsements all stopped

5
00:00:09.533 --> 00:00:10.700
Can fans not be anxious?

6
00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:13.366
These guys have been stuck downstairs for three days

7
00:00:13.366 --> 00:00:15.433
The skeleton of the Down family plummeted

8
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.600
How can it go on like this?

9
00:00:18.766 --> 00:00:19.800
Miss Tang, I don't care

10
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.300
You have to give the Chinese shareholders an explanation.

11
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:21.933
We have to explain

12
00:00:21.933 --> 00:00:23.566
Explain we have to explain

13
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.000
Hurry up and return Mr. Meng's sun

14
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
How is it possible to return it?

15
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.200
What's impossible?

16
00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.266
If the country falls again, everyone has to play

17
00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:32.766
Yes, yes, what doesn't work, what doesn't work

18
00:00:32.766 --> 00:00:33.333
What doesn't work?

19
00:00:33.333 --> 00:00:36.533
Most of the Yaoyao kings know that you are just being petty

20
00:00:36.533 --> 00:00:38.566
Why don't you call the fishing boat?

21
00:00:38.566 --> 00:00:40.100
Is he the best actor after all?

22
00:00:40.366 --> 00:00:41.400
Just ask for his help

23
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.166
As long as he comes forward with a certain immortal

24
00:00:43.166 --> 00:00:44.600
This problem is not solved

25
00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:45.766
Make a call

26
00:00:45.966 --> 00:00:46.800
Phone call

27
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.500
But what

28
00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.300
It's almost inevitable.

29
00:00:54.533 --> 00:00:57.600
Did Mr. Tang like my surprise for you?

30
00:00:57.966 --> 00:01:00.300
What scumbag

31
00:01:00.333 --> 00:01:02.500
Do you have something to ask me, little man?

32
00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:03.900
i

33
00:01:05.466 --> 00:01:06.900
Tang's Tiger General is still at the top

34
00:01:07.066 --> 00:01:08.566
Five points, six points.

35
00:01:08.566 --> 00:01:10.200
8 points to apologize quickly

36
00:01:10.466 --> 00:01:12.566
Su Yichuan, if I ask for help

37
00:01:13.666 --> 00:01:15.500
Of course you have to say it in person

38
00:01:16.066 --> 00:01:18.300
Miss Tang looks down

39
00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:19.900
I'll look forward to that.

40
00:01:20.333 --> 00:01:23.633
Tell me how you can let go of Tang Shi

41
00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:28.300
OK
