00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.166
The first one let me hum

2
00:00:02.333 --> 00:00:04.266
Count him Du Xinghe has a vision

3
00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:05.900
But I'm always a little uneasy

4
00:00:06.066 --> 00:00:08.300
After all, Tang Yao, you

5
00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:09.933
Just thinking too much

6
00:00:09.933 --> 00:00:12.400
The script has been sent to me, so what's the point?

7
00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.566
I think Tang's is like that, right?

8
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.166
Tang Yao, what are you doing here?

9
00:00:20.166 --> 00:00:21.900
Of course I came to see the jokes

10
00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.200
You should worry more about yourself

11
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.866
I see your relationship with your baby

12
00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:28.233
Not so good

13
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.000
He just returned to China.

14
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.300
Don't know anything

15
00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.700
Or else reveal it to him

16
00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:36.400
Just wait for Tamagawa to return to the peak

17
00:00:36.466 --> 00:00:39.900
Squeezing you to death is as easy as pinching an ant to death

18
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:41.466
You still have air traffic.

19
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.366
Did you read the script?

20
00:00:45.266 --> 00:00:46.066
That's not possible.

21
00:00:47.666 --> 00:00:49.766
Teacher Song, your play is very simple

22
00:00:49.766 --> 00:00:51.733
You play a phoenix man with a good heart

23
00:00:51.733 --> 00:00:53.600
Driving his pregnant wife to the hospital

24
00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.166
A serious car accident occurs halfway through

25
00:00:55.166 --> 00:00:56.233
Car crash

26
00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.866
Why is this plot the same as Tang Zhengchu?

27
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:03.600
Ah, I don't shoot anymore, Mr. Song, what's wrong with you?

28
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.900
Yeah. What's wrong with you?

29
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:07.200
Tang Yao

30
00:01:08.066 --> 00:01:09.166
You hurt me again

31
00:01:09.166 --> 00:01:10.700
How could it be? Best Actor Song

32
00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.866
I was sent by the director

33
00:01:12.866 --> 00:01:14.766
Play your pregnant wife

34
00:01:15.133 --> 00:01:18.800
Okay, get ready for 321 stupid

35
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.666
Let's die together later, no

36
00:01:21.933 --> 00:01:23.200
It's up to you.

37
00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.300
No, I'm not shooting, I'm not shooting

38
00:01:25.333 --> 00:01:27.033
Yuchao Yuchao
