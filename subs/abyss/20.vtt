00:00:00.666 --> 00:00:01.633
Please

2
00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:03.566
I beg you.

3
00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:08.433
Tang Yao, why are your begging words so harsh?

4
00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:09.900
What more do you want from me?

5
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.700
I beg you to stop manipulating public opinion

6
00:00:19.966 --> 00:00:21.600
I beg you to spare Tang

7
00:00:23.333 --> 00:00:25.366
Wouldn't it be better already?

8
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:26.633
I am the best actor

9
00:00:26.733 --> 00:00:28.800
I have countless resources and strength behind me

10
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.266
What are you making trouble with me?

11
00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:33.500
Let you go

12
00:00:34.133 --> 00:00:35.500
Just one sentence.

13
00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.400
But what to exchange with me?

14
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:39.600
What do you want?

15
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:40.900
What do you care most about?

16
00:00:40.966 --> 00:00:43.100
Chang Jun endorses movies

17
00:00:43.666 --> 00:00:44.466
movie

18
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.666
This year has changed the situation

19
00:00:46.733 --> 00:00:48.466
I want to replace Oscar's brain.

20
00:00:48.533 --> 00:00:50.000
I'm going to hit Hollywood

21
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.433
Let the whole of Asia and the whole world be what I mean

22
00:00:56.066 --> 00:00:57.833
Hmm, got it.

23
00:00:58.133 --> 00:00:59.366
It was a movie

24
00:00:59.866 --> 00:01:01.700
So let's start with the movie.

25
00:01:02.066 --> 00:01:03.500
Did you hear that?

26
00:01:04.333 --> 00:01:05.166
Director Xu

27
00:01:06.933 --> 00:01:08.800
It's Miss Tang

28
00:01:08.966 --> 00:01:11.000
The male protagonist of the New Year's Eve

29
00:01:11.166 --> 00:01:13.500
Replace him

30
00:01:14.533 --> 00:01:16.133
Director Xu, you can't be like this.

31
00:01:16.133 --> 00:01:17.966
We signed a contract, so what?

32
00:01:18.266 --> 00:01:19.766
I have money to pay

33
00:01:20.333 --> 00:01:22.700
No way, I'm a movie store

34
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.200
The black powder outside

35
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.033
Hmm, how is that possible?

36
00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.566
People don't have my orders

37
00:01:30.566 --> 00:01:31.633
How dare they?

38
00:01:32.266 --> 00:01:35.200
The new blow kiss will only sweep the old blow kiss

39
00:01:35.266 --> 00:01:36.666
Start today.

40
00:01:36.666 --> 00:01:40.133
People all over the world only talk about dream immortals

41
00:01:40.133 --> 00:01:41.633
Bully

42
00:01:43.566 --> 00:01:45.600
And the company decides

43
00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.833
To save the stock and image

44
00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:50.800
Decided to hide the dream fresh

45
00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.000
rise from the dead

46
00:01:57.533 --> 00:01:59.833
Wonderful why are you here

47
00:01:59.866 --> 00:02:00.966
You should ask

48
00:02:01.266 --> 00:02:03.000
When am I not by your side?
