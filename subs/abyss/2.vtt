00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:02.533
Mr. Lu, why are we avoiding him?

2
00:00:02.533 --> 00:00:04.033
Just a Song Yuchuan

3
00:00:04.166 --> 00:00:06.300
Without Tang's, without your support.

4
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:08.000
You can't climb to the position of the best actor at all

5
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:09.600
He thought it was his own effort

6
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:10.833
It's ridiculous

7
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:12.400
He is the person chosen by Yaoyao

8
00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:15.700
Miss Tang is in danger

9
00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:16.966
He just showed up now

10
00:00:16.966 --> 00:00:18.766
You threw out 1 billion overseas orders

11
00:00:18.933 --> 00:00:20.700
Private jet arrives in Jingzhou

12
00:00:20.933 --> 00:00:22.766
Came non-stop to clean up the aftermath

13
00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:24.433
You said this Assistant Chen

14
00:00:24.733 --> 00:00:26.200
Are you free?

15
00:00:31.266 --> 00:00:32.633
Such a serious car accident

16
00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:33.933
He's still alive?

17
00:00:33.933 --> 00:00:36.800
Tang Yao, you are really lucky

18
00:00:36.866 --> 00:00:38.000
Then don't blame me.

19
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.133
Blame Tang Zhengchu

20
00:00:40.133 --> 00:00:42.366
Gave you the only inheritance

21
00:00:42.366 --> 00:00:43.600
Then what am I?

22
00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:44.800
I am the best actor

23
00:00:44.866 --> 00:00:46.500
A hundred times stronger than you

24
00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.266
Pang Zhengchu never trusted you, and neither did you

25
00:00:51.266 --> 00:00:53.433
People never see it clearly

26
00:01:01.766 --> 00:01:03.166
I'm not stupid now.

27
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.433
See how long you can live

28
00:01:09.066 --> 00:01:11.100
Yaoyao, you are awake

29
00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.433
Thirsty or not, do you have any other feelings?

30
00:01:14.733 --> 00:01:16.433
Yuchen, I'm here.

31
00:01:19.066 --> 00:01:20.666
You've been taking care of me

32
00:01:20.666 --> 00:01:23.066
Of course I'm your husband

33
00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:25.200
Definitely have to take care of you

34
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.100
If it weren't for the old man's inheritance

35
00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.400
Who cares if our children are gone?

36
00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.433
Yaoyao, I won't blame you.

37
00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:34.600
Neither will dad

38
00:01:35.566 --> 00:01:38.233
Dad, how is he?

39
00:01:39.333 --> 00:01:40.900
Is Dad in the next ward?

40
00:01:43.366 --> 00:01:44.166
Yaoyao

41
00:01:46.933 --> 00:01:48.166
Your dad

42
00:01:49.333 --> 00:01:50.700
Not in the next ward
