00:00:04.766 --> 00:00:05.600
Zhou Xinghe

2
00:00:06.366 --> 00:00:08.800
If he doesn't love you, let him go

3
00:00:15.566 --> 00:00:18.533
It's Lu Xuan. The person he loves has always been Lu Xuan

4
00:00:18.533 --> 00:00:19.466
Never sure

5
00:00:19.866 --> 00:00:23.166
So how could he possibly marry you?

6
00:00:23.333 --> 00:00:25.000
Hahaha

7
00:00:45.533 --> 00:00:46.333
senior brother

8
00:00:46.933 --> 00:00:49.266
The Internet says you are quitting the movie industry

9
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.566
You tell me that's not true.

10
00:00:52.766 --> 00:00:54.566
Really? Why?

11
00:00:55.566 --> 00:00:58.666
The doctor said my right hand could no longer be divided

12
00:00:59.333 --> 00:01:01.666
So what's the point of me being a director?

13
00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.366
It's because of me that you got hurt

14
00:01:04.566 --> 00:01:05.833
It's my negligence

15
00:01:06.366 --> 00:01:07.766
It's all my fault

16
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.066
Yaoyao, this is none of your business

17
00:01:10.733 --> 00:01:12.333
And we're getting married tomorrow

18
00:01:12.333 --> 00:01:14.900
What do families divide and marry each other?

19
00:01:15.933 --> 00:01:16.966
You Love Me

20
00:01:17.733 --> 00:01:18.566
Really?

21
00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.900
So the wedding will go on as usual tomorrow, right?

22
00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:35.300
Yaoyao

23
00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.766
I was fortunate enough to attend the wedding of two newlyweds today

24
00:01:42.766 --> 00:01:43.833
Mr. Du Xinghe

25
00:01:43.866 --> 00:01:45.766
Would you like to marry Miss Tang Yao?

26
00:01:45.933 --> 00:01:47.900
I would like Miss Tang Yao

27
00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:49.733
Would you like to marry Mr. Du Xinghe?

28
00:01:49.733 --> 00:01:50.666
He doesn't want to
