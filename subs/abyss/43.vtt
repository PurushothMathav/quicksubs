00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:02.000
Tang Yao

2
00:00:02.066 --> 00:00:04.600
The amount of shares I gave you on your 18th birthday

3
00:00:04.666 --> 00:00:06.233
Is that what makes you so mad at me?

4
00:00:07.133 --> 00:00:09.033
I don't understand what Mr. Lu said

5
00:00:09.666 --> 00:00:10.666
and

6
00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:14.033
Didn't Mr. Lu drink like this before?

7
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.800
Tang Yao, you are the treasure of that lunatic Lu Xuan

8
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.633
Tang Seng's most grueling leprechaun Tang Yao

9
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:23.466
Hi.

10
00:00:23.466 --> 00:00:26.233
Say it earlier, Xuan

11
00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:27.866
Lu Xuan, no

12
00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:30.300
I really don't know about Mr. Lu

13
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.200
I swear I swear

14
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:32.600
I don't know. No

15
00:00:32.666 --> 00:00:36.833
Let's think about it again, Mr. Xu, I, you and I

16
00:00:37.133 --> 00:00:38.833
He wants to die, so do you?

17
00:00:41.533 --> 00:00:42.866
Lu Xuan, are you crazy?

18
00:00:42.866 --> 00:00:43.700
You let me go

19
00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:45.133
You're driving me crazy.

20
00:00:45.133 --> 00:00:46.666
Do you have no bottom line?

21
00:00:46.766 --> 00:00:49.200
Are you so shameless? I have no bottom line.

22
00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:50.600
I have no shame.

23
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.200
Mr. Lu only allows the state officials to set fires and not allow the people to light up the lights.

24
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.800
Yes, I, Tang Yao, am such a person.

25
00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.933
Now you finally see

26
00:00:58.933 --> 00:01:01.233
This is how I, Tang Yao, seek revenge

27
00:01:01.266 --> 00:01:03.133
Someone who can sleep with Xu Yanran

28
00:01:03.133 --> 00:01:04.600
Can you let me go?

29
00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:05.466
OK

30
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.566
I gave you something from Lu Xuan.

31
00:01:07.566 --> 00:01:09.100
Ten times that of Xu Yanran

32
00:01:09.466 --> 00:01:10.566
Instead of accompanying him

33
00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:12.266
Why don't you accompany me

34
00:01:17.933 --> 00:01:19.100
I Hate You

35
00:01:22.766 --> 00:01:24.400
Yaoyao Yaoyao

36
00:01:24.766 --> 00:01:26.866
I was wrong to bully you.

37
00:01:27.933 --> 00:01:30.200
Shouldn't use shrinking to deceive you

38
00:01:30.266 --> 00:01:31.866
I shouldn't have watched those bastards pour water in the factory

39
00:01:31.866 --> 00:01:34.300
Wine but I see you with other men

40
00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:37.000
I'm really going crazy, you let me go

41
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.800
I told you to let go of me

42
00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:40.766
I have nothing to do with the dormitory. I
