00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:01.433
I heard you were looking for me

2
00:00:02.666 --> 00:00:03.466
Ah!

3
00:00:04.766 --> 00:00:07.000
Tell me what the truth is

4
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.900
The truth is I'm getting married soon

5
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.500
Replace you and Lu Xuan

6
00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.166
I don't care about Down

7
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.000
Don't care about you

8
00:00:16.133 --> 00:00:18.400
All I want is Tang Seng

9
00:00:19.566 --> 00:00:22.866
Only someone like me is worthy of him

10
00:00:24.366 --> 00:00:26.300
Three years ago, I was coerced.

11
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.566
It's Tang Zhengchu

12
00:00:27.566 --> 00:00:28.966
He forced me to leave Tang Yong

13
00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.300
You killed Tang Zhengchu

14
00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.033
I don't understand what you're talking about.

15
00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:34.366
You dress up

16
00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.166
Approach me at the bar

17
00:00:36.866 --> 00:00:38.300
I always make car accidents.

18
00:00:38.533 --> 00:00:41.633
Tell me to mess with the brakes

19
00:00:45.333 --> 00:00:47.800
Give everything to the soup friend

20
00:00:49.066 --> 00:00:50.566
Then what am I?

21
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.600
If I were you

22
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.833
I will never

23
00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:58.400
sit still

24
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.233
That person is you

25
00:01:02.466 --> 00:01:03.266
The murderer is you

26
00:01:03.266 --> 00:01:04.433
The truth is you

27
00:01:05.766 --> 00:01:06.566
No, no.

28
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.633
The truth is

29
00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.366
You'll never know

30
00:01:19.466 --> 00:01:20.700
I'm a liar.

31
00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:22.633
I was a child

32
00:01:23.533 --> 00:01:24.366
But

33
00:01:25.466 --> 00:01:26.833
He won't love you

34
00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.566
Like he never loved me

35
00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.400
What? He loves him

36
00:01:35.966 --> 00:01:37.300
Someone else.

37
00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:39.733
Or is it because I work-study?

38
00:01:39.733 --> 00:01:41.266
Appeared in the high definition classroom

39
00:01:41.266 --> 00:01:42.766
It's the one I'm impersonating

40
00:01:42.766 --> 00:01:43.733
I am a villain

41
00:01:43.733 --> 00:01:46.666
It's a stand-in, when you're not even a stand-in.

42
00:01:46.666 --> 00:01:47.766
What right do they have?

43
00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:50.633
No.

44
00:01:52.333 --> 00:01:54.566
Is it possible for him to be obsessed with strangers?
