1
00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:03.666
I don't rent my villa to the murderer

2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.600
Song Yongdi, did you really kill someone?

3
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.133
Now the whole world is ruined by fans

4
00:00:08.133 --> 00:00:09.200
Do you have anything to say?

5
00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.000
The 80 capitals you have worked with before

6
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.100
Joint exposure of your black material

7
00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:12.700
Except for Down

8
00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:14.066
Did you offend someone else?

9
00:00:14.066 --> 00:00:15.133
Is someone trying to kill you?

10
00:00:15.133 --> 00:00:16.566
Emperor Song Yongdi, you have been working hard for many years

11
00:00:16.566 --> 00:00:17.533
That's it.

12
00:00:17.533 --> 00:00:18.366
What do you think?

13
00:00:18.366 --> 00:00:19.766
I heard that you are originally a phoenix man

14
00:00:19.766 --> 00:00:21.800
Only when he was appreciated by the Tang Dynasty did he marry Tang Snake for a thousand years

15
00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.766
Is it to do chrysanthemum eating at the beginning?

16
00:00:23.766 --> 00:00:25.133
Go away

17
00:00:25.133 --> 00:00:25.966
Sugar Treasure is so good to you

18
00:00:25.966 --> 00:00:27.100
Why do you want to avenge your kindness?

19
00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:28.466
Song Yuandi, won't your conscience hurt?

20
00:00:28.466 --> 00:00:29.700
No one in the entertainment industry will help you

21
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:31.000
You've been reduced to renting

22
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:31.966
Are you going to declare bankruptcy?

23
00:00:31.966 --> 00:00:32.866
Did the police look for you?

24
00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:34.500
Song Yuandi

25
00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:37.533
Damn scum I want to avenge Tang Island

26
00:00:37.533 --> 00:00:38.566
Go to hell.

27
00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.500
Yuchen Yuchen

28
00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:45.766
Don't shoot, don't shoot

29
00:00:45.766 --> 00:00:47.700
Ambulance ambulance

30
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:48.866
Call an ambulance

31
00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:51.800
deserve it
