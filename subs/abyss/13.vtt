00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:02.133
Are you ready? Don't worry.

2
00:00:02.133 --> 00:00:03.933
When did I let you down?

3
00:00:03.933 --> 00:00:06.100
What is the use of a mental appraisal certificate?

4
00:00:06.466 --> 00:00:08.466
I want the paparazzi to catch the current

5
00:00:08.466 --> 00:00:10.300
Send it in with your own hands

6
00:00:10.866 --> 00:00:11.933
Coming, coming.

7
00:00:11.933 --> 00:00:13.600
The new chairperson is insane

8
00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:15.000
Intentional harm, this is

9
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:29.766
Miss Tang, are you alright?

10
00:00:29.766 --> 00:00:31.166
We'll call an ambulance for you.

11
00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.366
Don't be sorry.

12
00:00:33.366 --> 00:00:35.700
I think of my dad every time I drive

13
00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:37.733
I really miss him.

14
00:00:37.733 --> 00:00:40.200
Who am I going to say that Miss Tang is insane?

15
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.100
I just lost it

16
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.800
It's too pitiful to carry Tang's alone

17
00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.266
No matter what lies are spread

18
00:00:44.266 --> 00:00:45.866
He also said that he deliberately caused a car accident

19
00:00:45.866 --> 00:00:47.300
snatch Down's nerve

20
00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.400
People obviously don't know the pain of abortion

21
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.800
You kick me and you are irreconcilable

22
00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:54.066
You have proof?

23
00:00:54.133 --> 00:00:55.200
What can you do with me?

24
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.966
If there is no evidence, I will look for evidence.

25
00:00:56.966 --> 00:00:59.233
Without proof, I will seek revenge in my own way

26
00:00:59.366 --> 00:01:00.266
Songchu

27
00:01:00.933 --> 00:01:02.466
I won't let you pay with blood
