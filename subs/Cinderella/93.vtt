00:00:04.566 --> 00:00:05.966
Whose child?

2
00:00:06.966 --> 00:00:09.566
I don't know. I don't know.

3
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.900
Are you sleeping with men too much?

4
00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:14.200
Even the father of the child doesn't know who it is

5
00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:15.833
Shameless bah

6
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:17.600
Slept so disgusting

7
00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.266
Yes, come home, this daughter is very beautiful

8
00:00:20.266 --> 00:00:22.100
Why is doing things so disgusting?

9
00:00:22.366 --> 00:00:23.766
The child's father

10
00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.433
Is it a teacher or a classmate in the class?

11
00:00:26.466 --> 00:00:28.700
Could it be which senior?

12
00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:30.900
Warm, you are too cruel

13
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.566
If a good child says it is destroyed, it will be destroyed.

14
00:00:33.566 --> 00:00:35.433
This is too irresponsible

15
00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.466
Warm, who did you give it to for the first time?

16
00:00:41.166 --> 00:00:42.400
Yeah.

17
00:00:44.366 --> 00:00:45.300
Sold

18
00:00:46.166 --> 00:00:47.700
Who did you sell it to?

19
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.500
Warm, you drank too much, I'll take you back first

20
00:00:55.766 --> 00:00:58.133
Miss Mu, I'm not drunk

21
00:00:58.133 --> 00:00:59.366
Why go back?

22
00:00:59.366 --> 00:01:00.633
What's your trouble?

23
00:01:00.666 --> 00:01:02.400
You are so strange

24
00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.166
We grew up together as children

25
00:01:05.333 --> 00:01:06.900
Although you have made mistakes before

26
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.900
But it's still the Mu family

27
00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:10.066
Warm drunk

28
00:01:10.066 --> 00:01:11.633
I'll find someone to take him first

29
00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.500
Enough, are you people interesting?

30
00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.066
Warm and I'll take you home, right?

31
00:01:17.066 --> 00:01:20.900
Qin Shao, please send the warmth back first, I'm not leaving

32
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.766
Don't you want to know who I gave it to the first time?

33
00:01:24.766 --> 00:01:26.500
Who did you give it to for the first time?

34
00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.900
To whom he is here
