00:00:02.266 --> 00:00:04.900
Xiaona, thank you today.

2
00:00:05.066 --> 00:00:06.700
Don't be so polite to me.

3
00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:08.900
Doctor Xu

4
00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:10.500
Then you still call me Doctor Xu?

5
00:00:10.566 --> 00:00:12.100
Didn't I tell you?

6
00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:14.033
In the future, call me in the early morning

7
00:00:15.566 --> 00:00:16.366
brother

8
00:00:17.266 --> 00:00:18.233
actually

9
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.300
In fact, I fell in love with you the first time I saw you

10
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:23.600
you

11
00:00:24.266 --> 00:00:25.766
Can you be my girlfriend?

12
00:00:26.066 --> 00:00:26.866
Marry you

13
00:00:27.966 --> 00:00:28.866
early morning

14
00:00:29.466 --> 00:00:32.400
You know my family situation

15
00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:33.900
Mother is seriously ill

16
00:00:33.966 --> 00:00:35.500
I don't have anything to save lives

17
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.366
I don't deserve you at all.

18
00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:39.000
I don't care about that.

19
00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.233
I really like you.

20
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.966
Can you give me a chance?

21
00:00:44.366 --> 00:00:46.600
We can try it first

22
00:00:46.766 --> 00:00:49.366
If you don't think it's suitable

23
00:00:49.533 --> 00:00:50.866
I will respect your choice.

24
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:52.300
OK.

25
00:01:01.533 --> 00:01:04.366
I didn't expect that warmth to be quite means

26
00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:05.800
I thought he was with

27
00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:07.800
Xu Yusheng is just playing

28
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.966
I didn't expect to be together

29
00:01:09.966 --> 00:01:12.966
Brother, why are you looking at me like this?

30
00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:16.500
recently

31
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.900
Do you remember two months ago?

32
00:01:19.066 --> 00:01:21.600
That we met at the Four Seasons?

33
00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.266
Yeah. What's wrong?

34
00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.133
You said you were celebrating your friend's birthday at the hotel that day

35
00:01:27.133 --> 00:01:27.966
Right.

36
00:01:29.266 --> 00:01:30.300
What room number?
