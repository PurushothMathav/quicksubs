00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:25.033
Lu Caution is that you have harvested my old company

2
00:00:25.133 --> 00:00:25.933
Made him jump off the building

3
00:00:25.933 --> 00:00:27.800
If you don't kill me, I must kill you

4
00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.800
Mr. Chen Zhen, I'm going to kill you, Police Officer Wang

5
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.566
Mr. Lu, look

6
00:00:32.566 --> 00:00:34.633
Fly to the hospital and fuck me

7
00:00:41.466 --> 00:00:43.300
Why would he stand in my way?

8
00:00:43.366 --> 00:00:45.600
If that woman's knife were a little more skewed

9
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.266
It was his heart

10
00:00:47.933 --> 00:00:50.066
No, he must have a purpose

11
00:00:50.333 --> 00:00:51.133
Warm you

12
00:00:51.133 --> 00:00:53.566
It's a good hard-to-get trick, isn't it?

13
00:00:53.666 --> 00:00:55.500
I don't need your education

14
00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.633
I don't need a woman to fall in front of me

15
00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:59.400
Mr. Lu, you misunderstood

16
00:01:00.166 --> 00:01:03.100
I saw a cat and a dog on the road

17
00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.233
Will it be?

18
00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.600
Don't look if you don't dare

19
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:10.866
Get him hospitalized

20
00:01:13.266 --> 00:01:14.233
I'm not in the hospital.

21
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.433
Mr. Lu, if you are not feeling well, you can live by yourself

22
00:01:21.066 --> 00:01:23.333
The police go through the hospitalization procedures

23
00:01:23.333 --> 00:01:26.400
I said I'm not hospitalized, so be careful

24
00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:39.266
Strange that this woman went to great lengths to drug me

25
00:01:39.266 --> 00:01:40.566
Climb into my bed

26
00:01:40.866 --> 00:01:42.766
Always pretending to be innocent

27
00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:44.633
Cover your greedy desires

28
00:01:45.566 --> 00:01:46.766
But why do I

29
00:01:46.766 --> 00:01:49.000
I didn't resist him as much as I thought
