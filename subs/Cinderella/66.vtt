00:00:00.466 --> 00:00:03.700
Miss Mu, Mrs. Qin has something to do today

2
00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:05.333
Let me accompany you to the gym

3
00:00:05.333 --> 00:00:07.966
Ash, you really have a way

4
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:10.100
While you don't have a lot of money

5
00:00:10.333 --> 00:00:11.833
I'll give you a thrill

6
00:00:12.466 --> 00:00:13.900
How are you?

7
00:00:14.366 --> 00:00:16.200
People like it

8
00:00:22.133 --> 00:00:24.600
Ah, I finally meet you.

9
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.433
That's fine.

10
00:00:26.733 --> 00:00:29.833
Did the teacher invite you?

11
00:00:29.933 --> 00:00:31.800
I will definitely take you out of here

12
00:00:32.533 --> 00:00:35.100
Nuannuan, don't worry about me.

13
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.233
They won't help me

14
00:00:37.366 --> 00:00:40.666
It's mom who cares about you

15
00:00:42.866 --> 00:00:44.200
Are you at home?

16
00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.333
Don't talk back to the rich boy

17
00:00:46.333 --> 00:00:48.633
So angry

18
00:00:48.966 --> 00:00:51.033
Just listen to them.

19
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.266
I see, Mom.

20
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.866
By the way, what blood type are you?

21
00:01:00.333 --> 00:01:01.666
I don't remember.

22
00:01:01.666 --> 00:01:04.133
You see mom is so old

23
00:01:04.133 --> 00:01:06.566
This memory is getting worse and worse

24
00:01:07.133 --> 00:01:08.666
How strange.

25
00:01:08.666 --> 00:01:10.933
I matched you for a kidney transplant before

26
00:01:10.933 --> 00:01:12.166
But not worthy

27
00:01:13.966 --> 00:01:17.066
Mom is tired and wants to rest

28
00:01:17.266 --> 00:01:19.766
It's okay, just go back.

29
00:01:20.066 --> 00:01:22.766
Ah yes, it's cold.

30
00:01:23.466 --> 00:01:24.866
So I heard.

31
00:01:25.466 --> 00:01:28.600
Miss Meng is pregnant, how are you?

32
00:01:29.866 --> 00:01:31.566
OK, I see.

33
00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.633
Then I'll rest early.
