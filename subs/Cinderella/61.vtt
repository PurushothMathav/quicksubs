00:00:00.066 --> 00:00:01.366
It's good enough for you.

2
00:00:01.366 --> 00:00:02.633
How can you do that?

3
00:00:02.866 --> 00:00:04.900
It's okay to be petty theft in your daily life

4
00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:07.466
But this ring is my engagement ring to Discreet

5
00:00:07.766 --> 00:00:10.133
I don't know why the ring is in my bag.

6
00:00:10.133 --> 00:00:11.300
But I really didn't take it.

7
00:00:11.733 --> 00:00:14.000
I think Butler Zhang knows better than me

8
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:15.800
You said I stole the ring

9
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.766
I also said you were stealing and framing me

10
00:00:19.733 --> 00:00:20.666
Throw out the ring

11
00:00:20.866 --> 00:00:23.633
You even dared to take the knife off me

12
00:00:23.733 --> 00:00:24.866
You're right.

13
00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:25.900
warmth

14
00:00:26.566 --> 00:00:28.166
You said that Butler Zhang will leave first.

15
00:00:28.166 --> 00:00:29.233
There is still surveillance at home

16
00:00:29.766 --> 00:00:31.766
Yo, since there is surveillance

17
00:00:33.133 --> 00:00:35.300
Who wants to know who stole the diamond ring?

18
00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:36.566
You can tell at a glance

19
00:00:37.366 --> 00:00:38.100
Everyone

20
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.300
They are all elderly people who have been doing things at home for many years

21
00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:41.100
Now.

22
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.233
Now that the item has been found

23
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:44.300
warmth

24
00:00:44.566 --> 00:00:46.066
Forget it today

25
00:00:46.266 --> 00:00:47.200
Destined next time

26
00:00:51.666 --> 00:00:54.633
Since it's your family business

27
00:00:54.766 --> 00:00:57.933
It's not convenient for us here either.

28
00:00:57.933 --> 00:00:59.566
As for eating

29
00:00:59.766 --> 00:01:01.100
Talk about it later
