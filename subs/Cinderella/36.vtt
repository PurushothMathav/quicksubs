00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:05.733
What brings you here?

2
00:00:05.733 --> 00:00:07.600
Did you take my mom away again?

3
00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.500
Didn't you say that as long as I keep the child

4
00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:11.100
Did you help him find Shengyuan?

5
00:00:11.133 --> 00:00:12.600
Shengyuan has found it.

6
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:13.800
Will hold soon

7
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:14.966
I changed his career

8
00:00:14.966 --> 00:00:16.966
It is also for him to have better treatment later.

9
00:00:16.966 --> 00:00:18.200
What are you nervous about?

10
00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:19.566
Where is my mom now

11
00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:22.066
Take a good look

12
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:24.500
warmth

13
00:00:25.133 --> 00:00:26.666
As long as you listen to me

14
00:00:26.666 --> 00:00:28.100
I will treat him well

15
00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:30.566
If you don't listen

16
00:00:30.566 --> 00:00:33.366
That's shameless

17
00:00:33.766 --> 00:00:35.700
What's the difference between you and a robber?

18
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.966
Of course there is a difference

19
00:00:38.166 --> 00:00:42.200
The difference is whether I can arrange a body transplant

20
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.400
Warm you are smart

21
00:00:44.533 --> 00:00:46.100
You know what I want

22
00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:47.600
Stay away from the armed police master

23
00:00:47.766 --> 00:00:49.933
Don't give him any future

24
00:00:49.933 --> 00:00:51.400
A well-kept secret

25
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.300
Don't tell anyone.

26
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.200
Otherwise, I'll protect you all.

27
00:00:57.066 --> 00:00:59.666
Zombie, don't touch my mother

28
00:01:00.266 --> 00:01:01.566
Don't touch him

29
00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.933
Then it depends on your performance

30
00:01:03.933 --> 00:01:05.000
here

31
00:01:05.266 --> 00:01:07.933
Not a place for a bitch like you

32
00:01:07.933 --> 00:01:12.833
Come on, throw this bitch out for me
