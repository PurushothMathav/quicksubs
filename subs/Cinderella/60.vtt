00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.166
I miss you, poor gentleman

2
00:00:02.166 --> 00:00:03.400
Don't care about you

3
00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:04.800
But this ring

4
00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:07.400
It's Jing Shen and Qing Qing's engagement ring

5
00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:08.800
Extremely valuable

6
00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:11.366
How can you put your mind on this?

7
00:00:12.533 --> 00:00:16.800
Maybe some people direct and act themselves. Second

8
00:00:18.766 --> 00:00:19.566
green

9
00:00:19.666 --> 00:00:22.900
Think carefully, did you forget where you put it?

10
00:00:23.266 --> 00:00:24.566
I see this little girl

11
00:00:24.566 --> 00:00:26.600
I don't look like a child who steals.

12
00:00:26.966 --> 00:00:28.700
Aunt did not

13
00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:30.066
I've looked everywhere.

14
00:00:30.066 --> 00:00:31.166
If so

15
00:00:31.366 --> 00:00:32.266
Then call the police.

16
00:00:32.933 --> 00:00:33.800
warmth

17
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.200
You think you can prove your innocence by moving out of the police

18
00:00:37.366 --> 00:00:39.166
Since the item was lost today

19
00:00:39.166 --> 00:00:41.000
That must still be on the thief.

20
00:00:41.133 --> 00:00:43.300
I suggest a body search board

21
00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.900
Better search his place too

22
00:00:47.166 --> 00:00:48.900
Gotta find out today

23
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:51.600
madam

24
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.766
There is no warmth on him. I advised him to look for a place to live.

25
00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:00.500
Find correctly

26
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.166
Miss, the staple ring

27
00:01:02.166 --> 00:01:04.666
Right in the warm bag
