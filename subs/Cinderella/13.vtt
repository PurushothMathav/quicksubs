1
00:00:11.666 --> 00:00:12.466
quietly

2
00:00:12.966 --> 00:00:14.233
Will you marry me?

3
00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:17.500
I know I'm just a current improvement at the moment

4
00:00:17.733 --> 00:00:20.233
This beautiful wedding doesn't belong to me

5
00:00:20.666 --> 00:00:22.166
But I am at this moment

6
00:00:22.166 --> 00:00:25.600
But I want to be the real bride of the man opposite

7
00:00:28.066 --> 00:00:31.100
The bride and groom are invited to exchange engagement rings

8
00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.166
His feeling of weakness and fear

9
00:00:42.166 --> 00:00:44.633
Exactly the same as that night

10
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:01.933
I will make you

11
00:01:01.933 --> 00:01:04.300
The happiest wife in the world

12
00:01:12.066 --> 00:01:14.033
The base of his lips is the same as the inner tattoo

13
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.800
The taste of cherry blossoms

14
00:01:22.066 --> 00:01:24.433
I know the person he wants to marry is Mu Qingqing

15
00:01:24.933 --> 00:01:29.000
Can you just let this happiness stay a little longer?

16
00:01:29.333 --> 00:01:30.966
Even for a second

17
00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.166
This dead stare

18
00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.300
Why is it so similar to warmth?

19
00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:56.566
I'm going to change clothes first

20
00:02:03.366 --> 00:02:05.866
Why did he suddenly seem like a different person?

21
00:02:06.533 --> 00:02:09.566
Why can I only be the shadow of Mu Qingqing

22
00:02:10.166 --> 00:02:11.000
Lu Caution

23
00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.966
If this wedding is really ours

24
00:02:14.966 --> 00:02:16.433
How nice it would be

25
00:02:28.766 --> 00:02:30.033
Barna on Economy Street

26
00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:42.800
Hey, fourth brother, look

27
00:02:43.466 --> 00:02:45.200
Miss Mu and warmth

28
00:02:45.533 --> 00:02:46.800
Does it look like a sister's hair?

29
00:02:55.666 --> 00:02:58.833
Who is the woman you are accompanying me with?

30
00:03:00.566 --> 00:03:02.600
Should I call your mother dear?

31
00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.066
Or keep you warm
