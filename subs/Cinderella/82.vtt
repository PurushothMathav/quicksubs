Xiaonuan

2
00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:04.133
Are you kidding me?

3
00:00:04.133 --> 00:00:05.500
I thought about it.

4
00:00:05.666 --> 00:00:07.433
I don't like you at all.

5
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:08.933
Xiaolan

6
00:00:08.933 --> 00:00:11.600
Do you dislike that I don't have a job now?

7
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:14.333
I just hate that you don't have a job.

8
00:00:14.333 --> 00:00:15.866
So let's break up

9
00:00:17.166 --> 00:00:19.133
I don't believe you are that kind of person

10
00:00:19.133 --> 00:00:20.866
Did something happen to you?

11
00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:22.766
You say it

12
00:00:22.766 --> 00:00:24.466
Tell me something.

13
00:00:24.466 --> 00:00:25.800
That's who I am.

14
00:00:26.666 --> 00:00:28.533
I am a person who hates poverty and loves wealth

15
00:00:28.533 --> 00:00:30.266
I dislike you for not having tools.

16
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:31.966
Xunchen

17
00:00:34.333 --> 00:00:36.266
Don't see you again

18
00:00:37.066 --> 00:00:37.866
No, no, no.

19
00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:39.966
come up

20
00:00:40.866 --> 00:00:42.133
You're definitely not that kind of person

21
00:00:42.133 --> 00:00:43.466
Did you encounter any unpredictability?

22
00:00:44.133 --> 00:00:45.666
You say it, you say it.

23
00:00:45.666 --> 00:00:47.500
Can I face it with you?

24
00:00:47.566 --> 00:00:49.700
Forget it, say it

25
00:00:51.166 --> 00:00:51.966
Xu Yunchan

26
00:00:52.566 --> 00:00:54.033
What kind of person am I?

27
00:00:54.066 --> 00:00:56.400
I wanted to make it clear to you

28
00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:57.600
I'm honest.

29
00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.200
Since you said so, then

30
00:01:04.866 --> 00:01:06.866
Hello, I've broken up.

31
00:01:06.933 --> 00:01:08.600
Now I'm at the morning delivery restaurant

32
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.000
Come and pick me up

33
00:01:12.566 --> 00:01:13.366
brother
