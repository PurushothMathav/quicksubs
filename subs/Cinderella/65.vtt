00:00:03.466 --> 00:00:06.133
Ah, it was my best friend's brother's birthday

2
00:00:06.133 --> 00:00:08.166
I went over to celebrate his birthday

3
00:00:08.566 --> 00:00:10.566
What's the room number?

4
00:00:10.733 --> 00:00:13.166
I can't remember a little bit

5
00:00:13.166 --> 00:00:14.900
Celebrating a man's birthday

6
00:00:15.066 --> 00:00:16.700
I would be jealous

7
00:00:17.333 --> 00:00:18.000
promotion

8
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.400
How can I celebrate another boy's birthday alone?

9
00:00:21.566 --> 00:00:23.900
I had a lot of other friends.

10
00:00:24.066 --> 00:00:26.300
Okay, I'll take you back first

11
00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:27.300
You rest early

12
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.033
Auntie will take you to the hospital tomorrow.

13
00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.166
Do a checkup

14
00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:33.866
Check what?

15
00:00:34.366 --> 00:00:36.466
Problem with pregnancy test

16
00:00:37.066 --> 00:00:38.800
Ah, no.

17
00:00:39.066 --> 00:00:42.066
It's just that my mom accompanied me there yesterday

18
00:00:43.133 --> 00:00:45.400
There's no need to check again, right?

19
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.700
Why don't you go and tell your aunt?

20
00:00:47.766 --> 00:00:49.466
Thank him for his kindness

21
00:00:49.733 --> 00:00:50.533
kiss

22
00:00:51.066 --> 00:00:53.966
Okay, then please Auntie.

23
00:00:58.566 --> 00:01:00.366
What should Ash do?

24
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:01.766
Father is a staff member

25
00:01:01.766 --> 00:01:03.533
Take me to the hospital for a checkup

26
00:01:03.533 --> 00:01:04.400
He looked it up.

27
00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.400
You can find out the wrong month of the child.

28
00:01:06.933 --> 00:01:08.700
If the Lu family finds out by then

29
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:09.900
You and I are doomed

30
00:01:10.166 --> 00:01:11.700
You can go to the maternity check-up with peace of mind.

31
00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.566
I'll take care of everything.
