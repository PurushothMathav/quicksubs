00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:01.766
My work is clearly done

2
00:00:01.766 --> 00:00:03.066
How dare you talk back

3
00:00:03.366 --> 00:00:06.366
Who allowed you to wear the same face as the lady in the lady's house?

4
00:00:06.366 --> 00:00:07.633
Wandering around here

5
00:00:07.966 --> 00:00:11.566
Go and clean every room on the second floor

6
00:00:11.733 --> 00:00:13.300
Immediately

7
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.133
Mr. Lu, you asked me to check it before.

8
00:00:21.133 --> 00:00:23.600
About you being drugged at the Four Seasons Hotel

9
00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:25.966
There's something odd about this.

10
00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:27.400
Miss Mu said

11
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:30.266
He went to the wrong room for a friend's birthday

12
00:00:30.266 --> 00:00:32.133
But the day I checked

13
00:00:32.133 --> 00:00:35.400
No one has a birthday at the Four Seasons Hotel

14
00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:38.633
come out

15
00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.266
I don't know exactly.

16
00:00:44.266 --> 00:00:46.566
The Mu family always likes to eavesdrop so much

17
00:00:47.166 --> 00:00:48.866
Mr. Lu is afraid of a misunderstanding

18
00:00:48.866 --> 00:00:50.800
I just happened to pass by

19
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.766
I happened to hear you on the phone there

20
00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.000
And it's far enough away

21
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.900
I can't hear what you're saying at all

22
00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:58.366
Dare to talk back

23
00:00:59.066 --> 00:01:01.066
Mr. Lu, if there is nothing wrong

24
00:01:01.066 --> 00:01:02.566
I'll go first
