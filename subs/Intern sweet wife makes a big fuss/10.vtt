00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.820
Go find out. Who put them in?

2
00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:04.240
All relevant personnel signed up. besides,

3
00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:07.060
Do a mandatory cleaning tomorrow. That is yes.

4
00:00:08.119 --> 00:00:09.680
Mr. Shen. Mr. Shen.

5
00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.480
I beg you. You must not sign me.

6
00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:15.600
I still have to calculate the price for him. I can't lose this job.

7
00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:17.740
Mr. Shen, I beg you.

8
00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.360
Forget it, it’s better to eliminate karma. After all, I still have to hide myself in the company.

9
00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.520
Mr. Shen, if your identity is not revealed this time,

10
00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:25.600
Forget it this time. lady,

11
00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.580
Thank you. Thank you.

12
00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:29.360
Why don't you go cook? Ah,

13
00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:35.980
Thanks. Energy person?

14
00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:39.440
Okay, this is what the workplace is like

15
00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:41.680
Then you come back to me

16
00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:45.470
Okay, I won't interfere for now.

17
00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.030
Those people are good or bad if they don't die.

18
00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:03.740
Yeah, it's a little strange

19
00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:05.560
I don’t want to talk about the future

20
00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.520
He's our housekeeper's young man

21
00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.580
They often have affairs at our house

22
00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.650
After all, it’s still a classmate’s art studio.

23
00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.350
Externally, I seemed to have seen it just now

24
00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:19.170
The housekeepers of the pre-employment committee will not come and go.

25
00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.290
For money, I can work as a mistress for that housekeeper.

26
00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.970
That relative is really easy to take care of if he doesn’t die.

27
00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:29.630
How dare you be the door wife?

28
00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:31.630
It turns out that there was a stinky man early.

29
00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:33.270
I'm afraid he's a smelly man in bed

30
00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:35.730
We can't talk about it, we can't talk about it

31
00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:37.670
Stop talking. Let's go.
