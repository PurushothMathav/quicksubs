00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
Please stay away. You have suffered a lot over the years.

2
00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.670
Maybe I just returned to my parents and didn’t want to get married.

3
00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:09.450
But it's your luck that Zhou's company likes you.

4
00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.400
There is no reason to refuse.

5
00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:15.120
Dad, Mom, there's actually one thing I haven't told you.

6
00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.210
i'm married

7
00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.420
And I'm two months pregnant.

8
00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.380
What? Said she was pregnant

9
00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:25.780
My parents should be able to give up. I didn't tell you before

10
00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:27.940
It's because I'm afraid you won't be able to accept my return.

11
00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:30.200
So I thought I would tell you later

12
00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.640
I didn't expect such a thing to happen. Why don't you want to say it?

13
00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:37.100
How can I explain this to Mr. Zhou now?

14
00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:46.260
If your career is successful

15
00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.740
Back then you were wearing all the clothes

16
00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.540
Was there a wedding before the previous marriage?

17
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.240
The prices there are not convenient

18
00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:03.030
You are living a very difficult life, right?

19
00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:05.930
Doesn’t he just have nothing?

20
00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:10.310
Just to have a full meal?

21
00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.080
Do you really care for such a man?

22
00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:17.260
I think it’s good to have a full meal.

23
00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.380
And he is very good to me

24
00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.200
The more capable you are, the more superior you are.

25
00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.000
So what do his parents do?

26
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.840
he has no parents

27
00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:32.800
Then divorce this little boy
