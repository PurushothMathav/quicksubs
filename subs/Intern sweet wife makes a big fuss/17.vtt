00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:06.610
Who is the performing lady? I am. Give it to me. Don’t say it. Are you sick? Yes. Or

2
00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:14.290
Is it a document sent by the Global Music Project? It’s not a notice of elimination, right? Dear Ms. Ye, you

3
00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:24.500
The manuscript has been published, the wedding in the dream has happened, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah

4
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:29.140
﹑ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah

5
00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:38.620
﹑ah,﹑ah,﹑ah,﹑ah,﹑ah,﹑ah,﹑ah﹑

6
00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:41.160
Then I won the championship again

7
00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.700
Don't you have to go crazy?

8
00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.830
I don’t know when I got lucky.

9
00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:51.550
Your wife, look at him

10
00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:54.810
It won't be through his body

11
00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:59.870
Spare our entire company

12
00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.519
Why don't you keep him

13
00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.420
Late for freezing electricity four times

14
00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.860
Hurry up and get that tribute

15
00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:17.900
Everyone is a whole

16
00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.200
Some people should not do it for first-level selfish reasons

17
00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.020
It's easy to come back to the whole company

18
00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.940
People should know how to be satisfied

19
00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:26.620
Learn to be grateful

20
00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:30.250
The way to be grateful is to make my mood hard

21
00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.370
I didn’t expect to review the group’s management.

22
00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.600
Still a dream card

23
00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.090
I know you envy me and remember me

24
00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:46.030
I'm a bitch who envy your dream card

25
00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:48.330
I still envy your ridiculous trainability

26
00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:50.410
Manager, you don’t know?

27
00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:52.250
It was because of plagiarism that he

28
00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.510
Do you think it's appropriate?

29
00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:58.530
Are you participating in the competition in the name of review?
