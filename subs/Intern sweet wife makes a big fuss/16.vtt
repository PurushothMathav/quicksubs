This is the number of entries for the Global Music Project.

2
00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:07.960
This global music project has not yet begun.

3
00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:10.900
Because of Mr. Chen's incident, all the judges of the competition were changed.

4
00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:12.880
Time also delayed camp sentences.

5
00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:17.280
The company has secured a spot for every partner who works as a Qinghui.

6
00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.980
I hope everyone will work hard to create and win their own situation.

7
00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:24.220
It's such a small thing to trouble you to come in and fuck you

8
00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.040
These quotas are all reserved by the president and have not been allocated in installments.

9
00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:31.280
If you all confirmed it, I would like to thank you.

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:33.280
Everyone thanks the president why

11
00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:36.230
Why is the declaration so good?

12
00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:38.730
I mentioned it out loud last night

13
00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.620
Today is too much trouble for you and me

14
00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.040
This is not what you want to do for us.

15
00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:53.960
The president was initially expensive

16
00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.120
By then, people in Brazil will talk more

17
00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:01.690
Why don't you kiss me too?

18
00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:08.190
