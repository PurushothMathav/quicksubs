1
00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:02.840
Everyone, I have a meeting.

2
00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:05.440
Young man, please step aside. I,

3
00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:14.710
Come and see me. I got a notification.

4
00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:17.550
The specific time for the Global Music Project is down.

5
00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:21.930
Just next week. I finally gave you the proof to one meter.

6
00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:26.380
Moreover, I have already contacted the judge Mr. Chen.

7
00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:29.220
If he likes it, we can certainly talk about it.

8
00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.340
Thank you. Go and participate.

9
00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:37.030
I have quite a lot of work ahead of me.

10
00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:38.890
I have no experience to participate in those meanings

11
00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:41.840
The person from the village chief is participating in the competition and is very sexy.

12
00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.250
You take it day by day

13
00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:50.230
Just want me to be at the company meeting

14
00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:56.320
Don’t you still need one person?

15
00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.220
You got up at will

16
00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:01.040
The new little one is for Xi Xisun

17
00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:02.760
I'm sorry that so many people will die.

18
00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.200
This competition does not necessarily rely on works

19
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.360
You are like Brother Kangli

20
00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.400
Chen Zong, don’t you know yet?

21
00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:16.440
a small award

22
00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.140
That's not a tight order.

23
00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.420
and body in exchange for benefits

24
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.550
I contacted you first

25
00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:32.400
Can be a global pre-plan

26
00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.020
It's up to you to participate this time

27
00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.440
There must be no scumbag, right?

28
00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.880
After you finish writing it, give it to the village chief

29
00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:50.380
If you write well, you will definitely win an award.

30
00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.640
He's a little intern

31
00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.110
hard on bed

32
00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.790
It’s also an effort.
