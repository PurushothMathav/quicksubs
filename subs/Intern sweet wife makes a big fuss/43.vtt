1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.920
daughter in law. I didn’t expect that your biological father is now the richest man.

2
00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.030
This time you go back and recognize your wife. Will it?

3
00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:09.920
You won’t marry me. What are you thinking about?

4
00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:14.330
How many noble men will want to marry you then?

5
00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.110
Bah bah. Don't you still believe me?

6
00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.800
In this life, no one but you can tell whether you can or not.

7
00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:21.980
Besides, we both have received our certificates.

8
00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.220
We are not all equal legally.

9
00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:28.980
Of course I believe you. But I still hope to have your parents' blessing when we get married.

10
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:31.880
I didn't find it before, but I have found it now.

11
00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:33.520
Finally I can do it at the wedding point

12
00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:35.760
Let you come to me with your father in your bowl

13
00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.650
Well, husband, you miss him so far away

14
00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:40.730
However, our arbitrariness will lead to too many weddings, so we need to cancel our account first.

15
00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:42.320
I'll go back by myself first

16
00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.620
Do he and I, the parents of a biology student, agree with each other?

17
00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.360
If he can act for someone

18
00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:51.200
Then we will cancel our wedding directly

19
00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.400
Living without parents

20
00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.520
Let’s travel and get married

21
00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.380
Then ask the security guard to take you back to the ground.

22
00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:23.700
Otherwise, I will personally send your wife to you

23
00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:30.760
You guys helped me out

24
00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.350
Only CEO Shen’s unmarried period

25
00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.850
He has been a gangster since he was a child

26
00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:50.600
The president just gave the order today

27
00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.340
Wait for the lady to wake up

28
00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.180
Just escort the lady to the couple's room

29
00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.740
Think they are too biological parents

30
00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.260
Then the guardian is the guardian father of the couple, right?
