00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:05.580
Uncle, did you go to the wrong place?

2
00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:08.100
He has this exclusive brother in the construction site class,

3
00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:12.060
What a bad luck. This is not to mention the exclusive butler,

4
00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:14.360
He just became a distant grandchild with me.

5
00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:16.940
You are still like this, we,

6
00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:18.620
Butler, tell him.

7
00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:20.220
Who is this special owner?

8
00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:24.800
The electrician is not old at work, kneel down quickly for the madam,

9
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.720
Look at some people

10
00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.780
This time I won't meet the official, so I won't be out of line.

11
00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.540
They should all be wearing cz resistance suits

12
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.780
What's going on with this guy?

13
00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:39.980
Didn’t Madam just say everything?

14
00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:41.980
The housekeeper built a garden for him today

15
00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:43.820
That's why it's like this

16
00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:46.600
Not to mention, there are special words to call it

17
00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.220
Responsible for all the numbers of Daliban people

18
00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:50.410
The butler never interferes. What a coincidence.

19
00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:51.950
I also know this housekeeper

20
00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:54.010
Do you want me to call you?

21
00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:55.950
Young man, you are so funny

22
00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:58.520
It’s not like you don’t want to be gentle.

23
00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:00.300
You need to apologize to Madam quickly.

24
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.140
So if you don't stand for him, you can still stay in the private trial.

25
00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:08.800
Having said that, you seem to really know the key points.

26
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.490
Don't pretend to be able to recover.

27
00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:15.140
Smile, young man

28
00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.370
Guan family, please come over here.

29
00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:21.570
Ouch, pretending to be like we really know each other

30
00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:25.670
It took a lot of effort to install this place, right?

31
00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:27.350
Grandma, it’s a long way to go

32
00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:29.130
Are you ready to delay early?

33
00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:35.020
I see you are apologizing for not returning home.

34
00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:38.740
He came to Chang'er on purpose today.

35
00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:40.920
Is it handed over to the player?

36
00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:45.400
Or are you feeling guilty?

37
00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:47.110
I can't even wait a few minutes

38
00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.470
Isn’t it a few minutes? It’s a long way to go
