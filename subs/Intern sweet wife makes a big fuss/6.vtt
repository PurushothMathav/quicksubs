00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:04.320
Every bottle of wine is worth much more than you own.

2
00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:06.160
Thatâ€™s right. What are you looking for?

3
00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:07.960
Then smash the rich man's precious sugar and wine.

4
00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.100
Who do you want to let go quickly? Aunt,

5
00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.700
Come here. Don't waste it on me.

6
00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:15.680
How many times have I said it. Keep this wine well.

7
00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:17.500
If you have to go through the general office without pricking you.

8
00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:20.980
Mom, I'm sorry. My mobile phone is as cold as ice.

9
00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:24.050
They say they call you rich. Don't be clique-y.

10
00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:26.290
The one who strikes is the one who strikes. No wonder not.

11
00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:29.430
careful. You use other people's things to declare your identity.

12
00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.930
Now he still dares to beat people. Night blue moon.

13
00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:38.290
How dare you say this is Bipai?

14
00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.440
Who is this villa?

15
00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:53.180
No wonder Xiao Jingwanâ€™s first meeting was Bi Pai

16
00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.280
Why don't you act like a threat?

17
00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:59.990
Teach yourself a lesson

18
00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:01.710
You wipe your mouth like this?

19
00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:04.989
He even believed himself when he lied
