00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:03.940
Sir, Qingyun grew up in an orphanage after all.

2
00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.080
Our upper class society's deviance from the rules,

3
00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:10.100
When the time comes, I will go to the party,

4
00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:13.460
What should I do if I make everyone laugh?

5
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.059
The face of our Ye family is the most important thing.

6
00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:19.930
There are still some occasions that have to be dealt with. Talk about going a long way.

7
00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:22.660
After all, our Ye family is Yuncheng’s operation.

8
00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:24.680
Then I can get a daughter who looks like me.

9
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.500
In this way, give Qingyun some time and let us study hard.

10
00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:31.370
Um. If you raise me, you won’t be able to thank your father.

11
00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:36.550
Your mother's score is almost four points.

12
00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:38.960
Soon I will lose weight and fuse

13
00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:42.100
Dad was almost beaten by Mom

14
00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:58.220
Although I was not born young

15
00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:59.940
But you took care of my dad for so many years

16
00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:02.800
I will definitely ask Aunt Duijin for a girl

17
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.040
Please be such a filial child

18
00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.550
Our family is reunited

19
00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:10.810
What will happen to me in the future?

20
00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:17.500
Let her integrate into our upper society as soon as possible

21
00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.380
I will definitely take good care of my sister

22
00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:23.520
There are many rules in our upper-class circles

23
00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.280
You must study hard

24
00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.510
Don't lose the face of our business owners

25
00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:32.790
I will never embarrass the Ye family

26
00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:38.220
Such an outdated gesture

27
00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.620
I'll take you back to buy some popular items

28
00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.000
Go to the most high-end video store in our cloud charging store

29
00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.130
OK, let's go

30
00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:53.960
It's an idea

31
00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.320
Why don't you hurry up and keep up?

32
00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:00.530
When I print money, I have two of them.
