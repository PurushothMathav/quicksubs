00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:06.290
It’s beautiful. Just like it. At that time, I was still afraid of cooking the food.

2
00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:08.070
You won't like it. Take another look.

3
00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:11.050
Today I can swipe my husband's card as I please.

4
00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:13.540
Then I won't be polite.

5
00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:17.720
Um. They all look good.

6
00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:20.110
Don't know who to turn to. Then I bought them all.

7
00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:39.590
Come. waiter. Wrap these up. Swipe your card.

8
00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:41.180
Can't do it. Why are you still here?

9
00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.380
What is it? It's quite a slap in the face.

10
00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.220
My man gave you a lot of money.

11
00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.610
Look at you. If this person doesn't get together.

12
00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.700
Living really hard. Compared to some people who have been shopping for a long time, they still come up empty-handed.

13
00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.090
The whole mall is excited

14
00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:03.690
Both of these things are mine

15
00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:06.540
Then why don't you see the lady?

16
00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.420
There are a few decent sections

17
00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:11.260
This is called the first tune

18
00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.470
Just the broken prison loan you brought with you

19
00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.350
The lady doesn’t take any of her dogs with her.

20
00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:17.700
Where is such a dog?

21
00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.440
It seems that he can actually bark

22
00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:22.530
Start with the dog

23
00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:51.850
I feel like I can't think of anything
