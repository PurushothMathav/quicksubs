1
00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:06.320
Didn't you come?

2
00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:08.080
Why should I come?

3
00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:10.720
I'm not like some people. Do you want to meet me? Thank you.

4
00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:14.080
Damn it, we won’t just watch this happen, right?

5
00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:16.070
No, I have to drive him away.

6
00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.860
There was a quarrel and a meeting was about to begin.

7
00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:20.080
Is your expression better?

8
00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:23.650
Then give me a choice

9
00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:26.480
What are you doing? I haven’t actually passed it yet, so I’m so petty.

10
00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:29.560
When the time comes, how will you actually tell me whether I can leave?

11
00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:40.430
Okay, sister, let’s see if I don’t die this time.

12
00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:47.030
Quarreling. Where are you making reports?

13
00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:55.260
Noisy, scary, scary

14
00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:57.860
You can literally cost me

15
00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:59.200
Our company's cost quotation

16
00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:00.440
you are not meaning

17
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:03.000
Why do you want to help me write Ten Million Experiences?

18
00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:06.240
What you wrote is obviously a meaning.

19
00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.600
You are too naughty, right?

20
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.480
Important data can be reported incorrectly

21
00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:12.040
If this is a really strong contract

22
00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.660
The company can only pay the 90 million price difference itself.

23
00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:16.300
Noisy, scary, scary

24
00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:17.340
You waste

25
00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.670
Our company doesn't support you in this way

26
00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:21.430
Give me your self-propelled person immediately

27
00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:22.210
Get out of here
