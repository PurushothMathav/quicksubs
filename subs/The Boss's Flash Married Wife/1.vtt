00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:06.080
Mom, I beg you, please don’t believe me.

2
00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:10.220
Oops, how long has it been since you broke up with Caoyang?

3
00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:12.710
If you don't believe it, you won't be able to grow old in this family.

4
00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.360
Mom, you will never forget your dead relative,

5
00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.400
Tell me yourself, are you a mid-range person?

6
00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:20.740
This time is different, people say,

7
00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:23.290
If you don't want to go, go quickly.

8
00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:26.710
It turns out that the coffee is light and the one holding the fire rose is,

9
00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.860
Copywriting, OK.

10
00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:40.440
Then take it to nature to take pictures

11
00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.430
It is my younger brother who is advancing in this family

12
00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:44.010
Look at this day in the original

13
00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:46.180
Hello grandma

14
00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:48.270
Don't worry

15
00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:49.640
I'll take care of you this time

16
00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.020
I'll let you say no to leaving

17
00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:55.120
You and your blind brother Qianjin from the same family

18
00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:55.760
That's it

19
00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:58.410
How many roses is your answer?

20
00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:17.760
Sorry, right? Sorry.

21
00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:19.380
Please be more personal

22
00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:21.930
You who reject her are you

23
00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:27.720
I'm from North Korea

24
00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:30.300
You come to give your three relatives your mood

25
00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:32.760
Excuse me

26
00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.140
Turn you into someone else

27
00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:37.670
Don't ignore her situation

28
00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:40.350
Don't like it

29
00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:45.850
Then which part of your daughter do you like?

30
00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.290
Everyone likes rich people

31
00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:50.380
you want to marry me

32
00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:54.100
When Congbang cannot speak the first word

33
00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:05.700
And there must be a large-screen room in the urban area that has been rerated for 300,000 yuan to get married.

34
00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:07.810
The sea wants to give

35
00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:13.020
And I won’t publish a book called Zhuan Zhuan Zhuan

36
00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:19.260
Thanks for the invitation

37
00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:20.680
Can I do all these?
