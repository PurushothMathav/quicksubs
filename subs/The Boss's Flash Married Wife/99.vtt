00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:03.610
Impossible. Why?

2
00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:05.720
But it has been three months, 2111.

3
00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:08.880
Today is three months, and I don’t want to see Xia Xia sad,

4
00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:12.270
I can kiss you in other ways,

5
00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:14.880
Marriage is impossible.

6
00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:34.600
Flower, the flower is not married anymore, cut it off and take care of the flower.

7
00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:37.110
But when you see these double lines

8
00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.230
I haven't watched it anymore

9
00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:50.280
This pair is our divorce agreement, Little Little Little

10
00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.040
you what happened to you

11
00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:00.180
Good, very good. Speak slowly when you cry.

12
00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:07.900
That is to say

13
00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.240
Yuanshan is free to sell

14
00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.560
Gu Huaer is going to Xiaoxiao

15
00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:30.380
Your body is really big

16
00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:33.410
I can only go out first

17
00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:43.670
Then I never want to see her little one again

18
00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:46.330
There are some words

19
00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.340
I didn't want to say it originally

20
00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:56.400
But from a man's perspective, I think

21
00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:04.690
I don’t want to be right or wrong with you

22
00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.470
And did he design with him?

23
00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.760
This team is small

24
00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.710
Do you mean you really like him?

25
00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:24.600
Then let's go find out the truth together.

26
00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:25.500
he really asked

27
00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:27.570
Then it’s not like I’m hitting him.

28
00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:31.530
You said we

29
00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.100
Brother Yuan Zi, you won’t go abroad anymore.

30
00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:40.220
You are all like this

31
00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:43.160
I might as well go abroad

32
00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:44.800
Let's check it out together

33
00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:45.800
This is all Yuan Zishan

34
00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:47.580
Where are you from and I want you to go?
