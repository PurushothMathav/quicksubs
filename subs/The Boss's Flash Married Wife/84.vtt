00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:04.510
Next time, you go again,

2
00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:08.530
I've made it clear, it's his intention that pays you back.

3
00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:17.500
It was me who got excited, please forgive me. Happy.

4
00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:21.210
During this time, I have a lot of things going on.

5
00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:25.470
I want to first think about the relationship between us.

6
00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.340
It's the best time for us to separate.

7
00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:31.060
What to say.

8
00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:33.400
I'm so tired, I'm really so tired.

9
00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:39.660
Something happened during this time, which made me think clearly about how big the gap between us is.

10
00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:43.500
Everyone thinks I'm not worthy.

11
00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:51.900
This is a place like this

12
00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:54.070
take a break

13
00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:54.210
take a break

14
00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:54.330
take a break

15
00:00:54.330 --> 00:01:00.200
Why girl?

16
00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.900
Divorce, divorce

17
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:02.360
The house you want to visit

18
00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:04.790
Doesn't it matter?

19
00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:20.440
can you

20
00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:21.290
do me a favor

21
00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:36.090
I won’t stay drunk until I eat.

22
00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:38.890
This doesn’t mean that grandma has been forgotten

23
00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:40.740
no grandma

24
00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:42.870
We are all too busy recently

25
00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:49.150
How did it come about?

26
00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:51.740
And today

27
00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.120
fell down the stairs

28
00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.130
My legs are injured

29
00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.740
Ah, it's okay, it's okay

30
00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.650
Ah, you are busy, you are busy, wake up

31
00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:03.970
I'm going to see you now
