00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:05.640
Doesn't this mean that everything has been attacked?

2
00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.360
Mr. Gu is rich? Why are you looking at him?

3
00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:10.780
What's going on? You said Mr. Gu is your husband?

4
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.160
Do you have any evidence?

5
00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:19.200
I am the proof.

6
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.530
What Xiaxia said is right, he is the existence service of the hospital.

7
00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:29.520
Does anyone have an opinion?

8
00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:31.320
How do we really deal with these?

9
00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.220
will be understood. Go and help me eat the gold pass that I lost.

10
00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:37.860
I warned you about this when I walked up.

11
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.260
Don't call me to find out.

12
00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.190
This sutra accidentally attracted my attention to some part of my vision. Nothing wrong.

13
00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.990
Look at it, look at it.

14
00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:49.810
Now you see that we are the same development

15
00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:51.310
Just forgive me this time

16
00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:53.490
You did this to me when I was a colleague

17
00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:55.300
If I forgive you

18
00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:56.860
You didn’t know you would need more people

19
00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:58.310
You need to be fired

20
00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:59.410
from now on

21
00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:01.810
A becomes all those who write polysum theory

22
00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:02.730
I advise you

23
00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.440
I don’t know if I should leave quickly and leave a scene of various kinds.

24
00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.300
Qiaoqiao, she is your wife

25
00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:11.340
If I knew

26
00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.100
It's easy to say

27
00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.060
Because people don’t give orders like yours.

28
00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:17.980
Pack up your things and go pick up the floors. Don't be so stubborn.
