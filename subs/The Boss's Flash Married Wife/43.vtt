00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.350
It doesn't matter what your identity is, it's a sword.

2
00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:10.190
How dare you recall me and ask,

3
00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:12.380
It's not love,

4
00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.830
It's too much.

5
00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:20.990
He has explained clearly to me that it is you who have been with the Communist Party.

6
00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:25.880
No, so you admit or have a bunch of them for the company.

7
00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.760
Forgiveness is true. The young lady got married and even took care of the family property.

8
00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:31.310
Still slept last night.

9
00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:33.860
Why don't you just say it?

10
00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:35.660
As the service director, he

11
00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.080
It depends on what policy you have. If you donâ€™t fall behind, who is it?

12
00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:41.080
I'm not doing it for money

13
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:42.920
If you compare money, you will be fined if you buy too much.

14
00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:44.240
Why did he not buy it?

15
00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:46.820
Then everything looks the same

16
00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:48.760
Once upon a time it was fresh at the same time

17
00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.000
The king then abandoned him

18
00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.370
Shut your mouth

19
00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:54.370
You don't care about your brain when you speak

20
00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:55.170
Then I'll take care of you

21
00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:58.060
I just want you to hand over and follow me here. Why?

22
00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:59.000
You are shameless

23
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.760
The Chinese say

24
00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.020
Look what you're looking for

25
00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:06.030
If you have an ugly face, you will usually eat it after finding one.

26
00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.330
How do you know he drove you?

27
00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:09.560
So uneducated

28
00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.370
Your parents usually donâ€™t teach you how to teach Brother She.

29
00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:18.100
Your sword-raising uncle

30
00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:19.780
You're still not harmful

31
00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.320
what are you doing

32
00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:27.340
Di said, look, there's a thief CEO now, right?

33
00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:29.140
Do you think he has embarrassed you?

34
00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:30.310
He just beat me
