00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.800
What's wrong with you? Come and bring one.

2
00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:22.300
Whose is Nono?

3
00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:22.980
You can act

4
00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:27.400
You, Nuoshu, are very busy raising one.

5
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:30.500
When I was at this time, she knew how to save me.

6
00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.049
Stop pretending to be dead with those two cars.

7
00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:35.100
I heard that I seemed to be dreaming about her at night.

8
00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.920
Don't know if

9
00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:51.960
Could it be that you ate something wrong? You eat?

10
00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:52.900
Such a meal

11
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:54.500
Go to the company

12
00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.070
I ate everything

13
00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:58.440
I even went to the company to measure food.

14
00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:01.450
You just need to eat, right?

15
00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:03.640
Don't want others to mean

16
00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:05.840
Don’t want to contact the company

17
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.400
be what they say

18
00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.580
It’s super difficult. How are you?

19
00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:33.800
It's a name

20
00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:40.660
You should also try to be kind to yourself and say yes, thank you.
