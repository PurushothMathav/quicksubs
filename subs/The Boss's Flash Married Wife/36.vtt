00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:01.810
nonstop,

2
00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:04.870
Stop, what's wrong?

3
00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:07.010
After saying that, you want to leave, right?

4
00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:10.700
I don’t even know how to apologize, it’s really my mistress,

5
00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.080
Every time I raise him, you say he is my mistress.

6
00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:16.450
I want to take it down, sorry,

7
00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:18.510
It’s not like I have a strong or negative temperament.

8
00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:22.200
Let me tell you, I think you are crazy,

9
00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:24.560
I don't even recognize your misunderstanding.

10
00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:26.500
Come on, what are you talking to him about?

11
00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:30.460
Solution, this is your fate!

12
00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:32.439
This belongs to me, and you are the mistress.

13
00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.960
He looks very reasonable and does not usually act like a fool.

14
00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:45.290
It's better to prepare to continue, right? It's sliding.

15
00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:47.230
you really are

16
00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:48.870
How do I tell everyone my identity?

17
00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.170
Look how good I am

18
00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:51.260
what did he say

19
00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:52.340
what did he say

20
00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:55.160
He said you are too early for me

21
00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:56.850
It just tastes bitter to me

22
00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:59.760
It's impossible for you to be just a mistress

23
00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:04.200
It turns out that you have to take the blame for everything in the world

24
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:05.220
Not like this anymore

25
00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:06.470
I never acknowledged him

26
00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:08.540
The only person I love is you

27
00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:10.340
I know how to slide

28
00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:11.440
If you really love him

29
00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:13.520
Even his political identity is concealed

30
00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:16.980
It’s really a fermentation of identity

31
00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:20.740
I'll tell you today

32
00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.620
To make you give up, you are not even a human resources manager.

33
00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:25.040
He got the total score

34
00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:30.150
That's the total he got
