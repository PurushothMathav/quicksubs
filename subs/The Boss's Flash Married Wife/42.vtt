00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:02.920
Moreover, I hug my husband,

2
00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:06.440
What are you listening to? I asked.

3
00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:08.760
Please, when will you watch it?

4
00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:12.790
Like students, they all watch.

5
00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:17.060
This sentence,

6
00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:29.970
It’s my opinion about language, please let me know.

7
00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:35.220
If I don’t let you hug me, who will?

8
00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:42.120
Ah, I said, the sky is like a piece of paper, it’s a pity,

9
00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.500
I'll touch him and ask for a discussion,

10
00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.340
Look at my four year old present.

11
00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:50.580
Hi, miss, please sit down,

12
00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.820
My friend, my father was right,

13
00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:56.080
I just don’t want you.

14
00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.190
And let me like you so much

15
00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.540
That calls me as a warning

16
00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:04.590
I don’t want your family to go bankrupt

17
00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:08.040
Just stay well and don't go out causing trouble.

18
00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:10.530
Noisy, noisy, noisy

19
00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:11.110
You sword man
