00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:05.090
Are you okay?

2
00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:06.590
Were you walking without opening your eyes?

3
00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:08.990
Can my clothes sink in and be raised higher? You just need to do your hair?

4
00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:12.160
Let me check it for you? What are you doing?

5
00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:15.550
Your little beauty? I have to let you see it all and make me pay for it?

6
00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:17.790
Can you tell me the truth with your feet?

7
00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:19.390
Because you came here to pretend to be me?

8
00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:22.550
What's your attitude? Can I have a relationship with you if I am you?

9
00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:25.690
Okay, okay? I’ll help you get fired like this?

10
00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:28.240
Miss, do you want to fire me?

11
00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:30.620
It seems like it's not your turn to decide yet, right?

12
00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:33.540
Really? Yin Da?

13
00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.160
What's the matter, stewardess? Your original worker dreamed of wearing my clothes?

14
00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:36.860
Still the least

15
00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:40.620
Why don't you fire him too?

16
00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.520
Xiaoxia, please don’t fire me

17
00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:45.080
Why do you fire me?

18
00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:46.480
I don't even have a current job

19
00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:48.160
I didn’t go back to the party and company regulations.

20
00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:50.630
taste it

21
00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:51.610
A person to meet

22
00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:52.610
Don't say anything about cheating money and sex

23
00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:53.960
Quickly beat him away

24
00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:55.100
what are you talking nonsense

25
00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:56.300
When did I cheat money?

26
00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:58.340
It's you, the stranger, who deceived me

27
00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:59.340
Years of early youth

28
00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:00.400
You make money with me

29
00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:02.750
Other companies are struggling

30
00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:03.970
And cheating soldiers out of money

31
00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:06.370
Can you think of the company going to Zhao Li?

32
00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:09.500
Should I be fired? Let’s see.

33
00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:11.970
Why don't you leave now?

34
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.120
Leave quickly

35
00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:15.420
What are you doing?

36
00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:16.630
why are you here
