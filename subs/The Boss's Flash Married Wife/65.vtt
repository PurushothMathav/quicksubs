00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:02.340
Get up quickly.

2
00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.510
Say it again.

3
00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:07.610
I'm fine.

4
00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:10.670
No. If you are wrong tonight.

5
00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:16.650
That's how everything should be.

6
00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.190
Let's go safely and safely.

7
00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:34.160
Don't cry and you can eat.

8
00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.120
Plus you are doing well now.

9
00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:39.040
We found a place to go and go.

10
00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:42.000
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go

11
00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:56.920
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go. go

12
00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.910
I want money when he gives me money.

13
00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.170
Just one of you

14
00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:04.550
What does rushing have to do with me?

15
00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:05.940
You want money, right?

16
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.360
You donâ€™t know it?

17
00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:11.900
Then I will go to your house to make trouble

18
00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:13.120
I let your parents and I let you

19
00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:13.780
Wake up and know everything

20
00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:15.460
You are a loanee for a party

21
00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:18.230
Are you someone who buys everything if you give me money?
