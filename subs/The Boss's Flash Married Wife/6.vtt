00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:03.860
By the way, which machine market will you go to?

2
00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:06.810
You definitely don’t have your identity, the lady doesn’t know yet?

3
00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:08.570
Didn't you hear her?

4
00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:10.720
Don’t want to admit your relationship with the boss?

5
00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:15.880
Only if your message is from China, can you help me handle the discussion?

6
00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:29.910
You're a dead car, why are you so good?

7
00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:31.790
You don’t have to die Yashima

8
00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:34.890
You still said no, why would you want your car to die?

9
00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.000
I heard, I heard, our boss is going to work in the market?

10
00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.400
I know, what's the matter with you?

11
00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:43.940
Why don't you move at one o'clock?

12
00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.700
What kind of politeness is this?

13
00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:47.760
Listen to our main station

14
00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:48.940
Ring tip fried waist

15
00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:49.900
Fire breaks out

16
00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.040
Since I have no intention of feeling sleepy,

17
00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.020
Is it a new hate?

18
00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:56.850
You said it would be better if you were raped?

19
00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.010
The price is awesome

20
00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:00.030
From now on, everyone around me is crazy

21
00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.300
Also ate

22
00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:03.520
You're not afraid of that CEO either

23
00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:05.960
He's just complaining

24
00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:06.620
How is it possible

25
00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:08.100
The main station in other people’s novels

26
00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:12.340
Aren’t they all handsome and smart people?

27
00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:21.760
I drove up and thank you some people

28
00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:23.970
From day one to night, I always thought about this high-end dish

29
00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.710
Do you think I'm always the one who cares about your job as a clerk?

30
00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.570
And adjust it a bit

31
00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.880
Come to the company looking like this

32
00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:33.630
Those who know say you are here to work

33
00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:34.860
Not going there

34
00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.440
And our company does it all over again

35
00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:38.300
Another level

36
00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:41.020
I do it because I dare to be more accurate

37
00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:42.980
I wrote down the pretense of that life

38
00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:44.440
Xiaolong has been released

39
00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:54.280
but what happened to you
