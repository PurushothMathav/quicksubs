00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.070
Mom, what's inappropriate?

2
00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:04.960
Stop it, don't call me mom yet.

3
00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:07.960
You are getting married to Xiaxia, are you getting married?

4
00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:11.030
Have you bought Sanqing? Marriage is so careless,

5
00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:14.410
What do you think Gao is? Mom, shut up.

6
00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:17.390
Marriage is so stable and you don't even discuss it with me,

7
00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.380
What did we think?

8
00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:26.820
Hello aunt.

9
00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.070
Auntie, Atom is here, come in and make grass quickly.

10
00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.520
Auntie, I'm here to guide you.

11
00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.640
Auntie, this is a lot of money.

12
00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:41.640
One person should be careful,

13
00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.740
This is the one who had a flash marriage with Xiaxia

14
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:49.980
Kong's hand is still

15
00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.680
Not polite at all

16
00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.220
So what do you mean?

17
00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:57.880
We don’t even know how grand our family will be when we come down.

18
00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:02.510
But it's settled, right? Don't be angry.

19
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.720
If the Xixiayun family gave it to me

20
00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.310
I'm willing to play this again

21
00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:12.240
How about writing Qiang Tan’s name?

22
00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:14.260
Better name

23
00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.670
Another whole night spent eating and understanding people

24
00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.570
It’s the name of the property that was transferred

25
00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:25.130
We are guaranteed now and in the future, isn’t it?

26
00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:27.730
I planned for you and I was wrong

27
00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:29.580
Their wife

28
00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:30.880
Not good-looking

29
00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:32.540
There are also quite a few paintings of people wearing clothes.

30
00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:34.200
There must be a lot of girls chasing her

31
00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:36.400
I'm still so service-oriented to you

32
00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:37.520
give nothing

33
00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:39.030
It's time to go home

34
00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.010
Who do you ask to cry?

35
00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.200
Little prince, who is your name?
