00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:16.300
Don't be too suitable for your mother

2
00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:27.910
See this clearly. If you want to buy clothes in our store, this is a pheasant. This is a hot food shop.

3
00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:33.950
If you can't afford the fish, you have to touch it randomly. I'm afraid you'll damage it if you touch it. I can't afford to stay with you like this.

4
00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:36.130
You can warm your feet and prepare to put something on them

5
00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:37.810
Didn’t I see you when you got up too?

6
00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:41.780
The clothes for juniors and juniors are so big, right?

7
00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:45.220
Sister, Miss Han, you are here

8
00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:50.360
Why are you here?

9
00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:51.360
Did he offend you?

10
00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:53.200
Check me out later

11
00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:55.360
I said you are here

12
00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:56.680
How can anyone be tight?

13
00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.600
It means that I am like him

14
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:00.940
Is it a net worth?

15
00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:02.440
Don't let him get further away

16
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.160
Did you hear that?

17
00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.870
The further away you go, the easier it is to get out.

18
00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:10.260
Show me the rice

19
00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:13.780
Who gave you praise and blame?

20
00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:15.100
Ask and talk to me quickly

21
00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:16.420
What do I listen to, adults?

22
00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.440
I thought I had switched to a facility store

23
00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:20.340
If it can be washed off your body, it can’t be considered useful.

24
00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:22.750
People like you who love people's eyes

25
00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:24.400
You don’t deserve to be recommended to me at all.

26
00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:28.890
I advise you to be careful when you speak.
