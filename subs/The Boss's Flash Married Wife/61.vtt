00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:03.320
Okay, just two first, just two,

2
00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:05.780
Where is the Prime Minister’s wife on the first floor?

3
00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.850
One is on the A floor and is given to the president.

4
00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:12.910
Wouldn’t you just get the CEO’s wife?

5
00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:17.110
My husband just got the CEO title and he won’t come back!

6
00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:18.850
His husband is not coming back!

7
00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:21.270
Quarrel, quarrel! Do I like pure autumn white people?

8
00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.490
What do you mean? I know,

9
00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:27.950
I got it to go to work, but have I ever seen Mrs. Red Film?

10
00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:29.910
He wants to show you more

11
00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:30.930
down down down down

12
00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:33.230
You are protected by Cao Yapao and several others.

13
00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:34.330
You gave up the judgment

14
00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:35.650
Zhao Laojinzi, take a look

15
00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:44.630
Hey, you don’t want to play?

16
00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:45.950
Someone is bullying your wife

17
00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:47.430
did you find it

18
00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:48.880
I'm at 29 o'clock West

19
00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:51.060
Hey, crying

20
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:53.480
Where did you ask for the CEO?

21
00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.440
I'm your wife

22
00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:58.220
That is, where do you want the CEO’s wife?

23
00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:03.270
I want to brag about the person who bullied me, is that okay?

24
00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:09.640
I want to fire you

25
00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:11.200
You also have to be quite similar.

26
00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:14.130
I didn’t expect you to be sweet enough to be Xiaoxun

27
00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:22.140
It makes me laugh so hard. What’s your point of laughter?

28
00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.900
You've been in a bad mood all day today

29
00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:29.280
I don’t understand any company that has no proprietary relationship with the cloud.
