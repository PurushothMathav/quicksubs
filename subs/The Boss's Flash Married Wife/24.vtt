00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:04.920
Phenomenon, these are the clothes you bought.

2
00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:18.600
Just people, go. Go.

3
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.920
This is, my mother is very nice, you can buy it for me,

4
00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.100
Then I am laughing, I am trying to get someone to miss me.

5
00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:41.980
Damn it, you are really married,

6
00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.090
But this is really counter-intuitive. If you donâ€™t deal with this, your family is in a very different situation.

7
00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:47.490
You are so angry. mom,

8
00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.410
On the contrary, he is not replacing someone,

9
00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.800
Are you going out?

10
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.280
Eat fruit, how old are you?

11
00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.860
What to do?

12
00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:00.750
Dad, he is already 26,

13
00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.100
Call our company to work, tell my boss,

14
00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:06.300
Boss, let's order it over.

15
00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:10.050
What have I just joined these two days?

16
00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:19.320
I just wish I could get married in two days, young man

17
00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:21.900
It's not appropriate for you to lay down for me
