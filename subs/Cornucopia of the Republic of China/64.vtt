1
00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.000
Li Jiaren, you still have no face

2
00:00:02.333 --> 00:00:03.000
Oppress the people

3
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.266
Obviously it was your Li family who did it

4
00:00:04.266 --> 00:00:05.466
Why should you put it on our heads?

5
00:00:05.466 --> 00:00:06.466
I said it again.

6
00:00:07.333 --> 00:00:09.433
Since he wants to visit Xinsha Town

7
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:10.600
as

8
00:00:11.566 --> 00:00:14.400
What we see is what we believe.

9
00:00:14.466 --> 00:00:16.300
You said that yourself.

10
00:00:16.966 --> 00:00:19.233
Qingshan Town must have a lot of evidence of him

11
00:00:19.666 --> 00:00:20.700
We can't miss it

12
00:00:22.066 --> 00:00:23.900
Ben is here to patrol

13
00:00:23.966 --> 00:00:25.966
So seeing is believing.

14
00:00:26.766 --> 00:00:27.566
Mayor Wu

15
00:00:28.166 --> 00:00:29.300
Lead the way

16
00:00:36.366 --> 00:00:38.666
What are you doing? Get out of the way

17
00:00:42.333 --> 00:00:43.900
You live in such a shabby place

18
00:00:44.166 --> 00:00:46.400
It seems that Yada usually bullies you a lot.

19
00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:47.766
Return to Mandarin

20
00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.766
If it weren't for Master Wu's stuttering

21
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.400
The little one is starving to death

22
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:52.266
fart

23
00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.300
Are you afraid to tell the truth when you see Wu Tian here?

24
00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:56.300
Ladies and gentlemen

25
00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:57.800
I really didn't lie.

26
00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.600
Since you keep saying that Wu Tian will give you food

27
00:01:00.666 --> 00:01:02.800
I'm going to search your rice bowl noodle bowl

28
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:03.933
Sir, come on

29
00:01:03.933 --> 00:01:05.466
I'm not lying.

30
00:01:05.466 --> 00:01:08.066
You're courting death, don't blame me.

31
00:01:14.166 --> 00:01:15.466
Sir, look

32
00:01:18.166 --> 00:01:19.466
Where did this rice come from?

33
00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.066
Oops so much rice

34
00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:23.900
There is famine everywhere

35
00:01:24.066 --> 00:01:25.266
You have money

36
00:01:25.266 --> 00:01:27.866
Sir, this is a small one working for Mayor Wu

37
00:01:27.866 --> 00:01:29.333
What he paid me?

38
00:01:29.333 --> 00:01:30.400
That's pretty good.

39
00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.566
I did give it to him, and it doesn't count.

40
00:01:33.733 --> 00:01:34.866
In Qingshan Town

41
00:01:35.333 --> 00:01:36.700
He is the strongest man
