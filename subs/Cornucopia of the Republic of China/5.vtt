00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.533
Don't move, I'm just going to buy a wowotou

2
00:00:02.533 --> 00:00:04.166
I don't know anything.

3
00:00:04.533 --> 00:00:06.500
Squat down and be honest with me

4
00:00:08.166 --> 00:00:09.966
This medicine is called aspirin

5
00:00:09.966 --> 00:00:11.333
I need him to treat the wounded

6
00:00:11.333 --> 00:00:12.566
Anyone who has this medicine

7
00:00:12.566 --> 00:00:13.566
Be honest with me

8
00:00:13.566 --> 00:00:14.566
Aspirin

9
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:15.733
Api, who dares to try it?

10
00:00:15.733 --> 00:00:17.566
You immediately send him to see Yama

11
00:00:17.666 --> 00:00:19.766
We haven't seen it, we don't know.

12
00:00:19.766 --> 00:00:20.800
No, right?

13
00:00:20.933 --> 00:00:23.400
Pull out an old me for me, I'll think about it again

14
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.766
I think I can't stop the medicine before dark

15
00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:27.233
How to die

16
00:00:28.166 --> 00:00:29.233
Aspirin

17
00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:30.900
That's a lifesaver.

18
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.666
If I replicate with a cornucopia

19
00:00:32.666 --> 00:00:34.666
Will the army thank me?

20
00:00:34.666 --> 00:00:35.966
In the Republic of China

21
00:00:35.966 --> 00:00:37.833
Power comes out of the barrel of the gun

22
00:00:38.133 --> 00:00:39.366
That officer

23
00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:40.566
I have seen that medicine

24
00:00:40.566 --> 00:00:41.666
I can find it.

25
00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.966
Where have you seen it?

26
00:00:44.066 --> 00:00:47.100
Hand over that officer, I can't take it out now

27
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.133
As long as you give me time

28
00:00:48.133 --> 00:00:49.333
I will definitely be able to come out of inferior quality.

29
00:00:49.333 --> 00:00:51.066
Are you out of your fucking mind?

30
00:00:51.066 --> 00:00:52.300
Do you want me to give you all the points?

31
00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:53.166
Wait a minute.

32
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.266
Can't get a thousand pills before dark

33
00:00:55.466 --> 00:00:56.966
You regret standing in this world

34
00:00:57.533 --> 00:00:58.500
Give him a pill

35
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:01.666
Here you go. Look good.

36
00:01:01.933 --> 00:01:04.433
Wrong order, no problem.

37
00:01:17.366 --> 00:01:19.700
Okay, that should be about it.

38
00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.466
The cornucopia seems to have cracked

39
00:01:38.666 --> 00:01:41.400
Can't I get it dirty in my hands?
