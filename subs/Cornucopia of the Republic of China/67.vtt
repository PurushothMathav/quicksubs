00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.633
He's going to sell the factory.

2
00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:02.400
So he agreed.

3
00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:03.766
But he did have some conditions.

4
00:00:05.066 --> 00:00:05.866
Not in a hurry

5
00:00:06.566 --> 00:00:08.133
Practice again, right?

6
00:00:08.133 --> 00:00:10.800
He also sent a batch of gifts to bring in

7
00:00:15.966 --> 00:00:18.900
It seems that Raul is really in a hurry this time.

8
00:00:19.966 --> 00:00:22.500
Okay, send it to the house for me

9
00:00:31.533 --> 00:00:34.200
I didn't expect you to get married so early

10
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.666
Married a rich man

11
00:00:35.666 --> 00:00:38.566
Lili, I feel very happy myself

12
00:00:39.466 --> 00:00:40.333
You

13
00:00:40.333 --> 00:00:43.666
I just stayed in the country for a long time and had no knowledge at all

14
00:00:44.333 --> 00:00:45.466
What time is it?

15
00:00:45.466 --> 00:00:46.600
What time?

16
00:00:47.366 --> 00:00:48.633
What do you mean?

17
00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:52.900
Look at this.

18
00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.500
It's a high-end product I brought back from the West

19
00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.366
You can use it to see the time.

20
00:00:59.466 --> 00:01:01.266
Do you understand, Sister Xiaoting?

21
00:01:01.266 --> 00:01:02.700
This thing still works

22
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.066
Amazing.

23
00:01:04.066 --> 00:01:06.766
Yes, Lili, you are amazing.

24
00:01:07.066 --> 00:01:08.800
I don't even understand this thing

25
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.500
So you don't know?

26
00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.333
This pocket watch is nothing

27
00:01:12.333 --> 00:01:13.866
There are many good things about the sunset

28
00:01:13.866 --> 00:01:15.366
There is also a watch called

29
00:01:15.366 --> 00:01:16.866
Precious

30
00:01:18.966 --> 00:01:20.933
Just clip up everything in your house

31
00:01:20.933 --> 00:01:22.400
Can't buy a watch

32
00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.566
Oops, then take this thing quickly

33
00:01:25.566 --> 00:01:28.466
It's so precious, don't lose it. What is this?

34
00:01:28.466 --> 00:01:29.600
Wait for my next visit to Xinyang.

35
00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.166
I'll bring you one too

36
00:01:34.933 --> 00:01:39.266
Daughter-in-law, this is my cousin, right?

37
00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:40.600
Lili

38
00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:42.533
This is your cousin-in-law

39
00:01:42.533 --> 00:01:46.300
Cousin, I thought it was some gentlemen

40
00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:48.366
Why did you marry him?
