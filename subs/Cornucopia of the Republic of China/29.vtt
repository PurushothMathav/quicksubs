00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:19.400
Not enough time.

2
00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.466
The rest should be about the same.

3
00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.300
He forgot that the brothers in front of him couldn't stand it anymore

4
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.366
Now the brothers are dead and wounded

5
00:00:32.366 --> 00:00:35.866
You can't even last 10 damn minutes!

6
00:00:36.366 --> 00:00:39.166
You can't work part-time without ammo

7
00:00:39.166 --> 00:00:42.266
Hang yourself, surrender now

8
00:00:42.266 --> 00:00:43.666
Spit your spit

9
00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.266
Forget it, I can still ride myself

10
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:47.666
Handsome

11
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:48.500
Senior brother

12
00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.966
Where are you going?

13
00:00:49.966 --> 00:00:51.133
Can't you go?

14
00:00:51.133 --> 00:00:53.800
Teacher, if it wasn't for this kid stalling for time

15
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.200
We've already retreated, we can't let him

16
00:00:56.733 --> 00:00:57.700
Where are your things?

17
00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.166
Yeah. Didn't you see it coming empty-handed?

18
00:01:00.166 --> 00:01:02.100
He must have wanted to say something nice

19
00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.100
Recommend development for yourself

20
00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:04.233
Let me shoot him

21
00:01:04.266 --> 00:01:06.533
I'm talking to my big brother, how can you interject?

22
00:01:06.533 --> 00:01:08.066
Go away and die

23
00:01:08.066 --> 00:01:08.900
Don't stop

24
00:01:09.933 --> 00:01:10.466
Brother

25
00:01:10.466 --> 00:01:13.466
Is there any cannonball for my brother to plant flowers with?

26
00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:16.800
Also come in
