00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:02.333
Is this fleeing the famine?

2
00:00:02.333 --> 00:00:03.233
So elegant

3
00:00:04.133 --> 00:00:06.900
My uncle's family is a well-known local family

4
00:00:07.133 --> 00:00:09.033
My cousin kept a sheep

5
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:10.866
If it weren't for the disaster victims

6
00:00:10.866 --> 00:00:12.166
They won't come here

7
00:00:12.333 --> 00:00:14.200
Yes sir

8
00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:16.066
Oh, I see.

9
00:00:16.066 --> 00:00:18.466
Wait a minute, let's have a drink and arrange it, sir.

10
00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:21.300
I heard that the second young master has been locked up

11
00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.333
How do you plan to deal with it?

12
00:00:23.333 --> 00:00:26.333
He has been of no use recently.

13
00:00:26.333 --> 00:00:27.133
how

14
00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.366
You seem to care about him

15
00:00:29.366 --> 00:00:31.966
I can just ask casually

16
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
You have nothing to do here

17
00:00:36.166 --> 00:00:38.966
God, why don't you die?

18
00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.600
Just because the second young master has not been rescued yet

19
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.766
Go and make a bowl of porridge for Lao Tzu.

20
00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:47.200
Give me a bowl

21
00:00:51.366 --> 00:00:53.466
Hey, the head of the team this week

22
00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:55.333
There seems to be a problem

23
00:00:55.333 --> 00:00:56.500
What's the problem?

24
00:00:56.733 --> 00:00:58.700
Is it worse than grass root?

25
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.366
What the hell are you doing?

26
00:01:03.566 --> 00:01:05.666
The leaders are all unsigned

27
00:01:06.066 --> 00:01:08.233
I add sand to the porridge

28
00:01:08.533 --> 00:01:12.200
His grandmother put sand in the porridge to kill me

29
00:01:12.933 --> 00:01:13.833
Don't be angry.

30
00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.833
Let's call all our brothers over and eat him poor

31
00:01:17.166 --> 00:01:18.166
Eat a fart

32
00:01:19.866 --> 00:01:21.900
Wu Tian dares to fight with Lao Tzu

33
00:01:22.066 --> 00:01:23.566
I will sue the province

34
00:01:23.566 --> 00:01:24.666
Let the grand marshal go

35
00:01:24.666 --> 00:01:27.466
He is guilty of putting sand in the porridge

36
00:01:27.533 --> 00:01:28.633
You will die

37
00:01:29.066 --> 00:01:30.766
Commander, this is a good idea

38
00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:32.400
Let's go

39
00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.166
The mayor, Mr. Second Brother

40
00:01:39.166 --> 00:01:41.300
There is a careful military factory in the West

41
00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.400
I come to a place like this and there is a fee for every marriage

42
00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.466
If you don't want to waste money

43
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.366
Please save time

44
00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:49.500
Mr. Second

45
00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.300
How much does a day cost?

46
00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.833
3,000 oceans on day one.

47
00:01:55.133 --> 00:01:56.500
I spent 100,000 ocean

48
00:01:56.933 --> 00:01:59.800
I also ask Mr. Occasionally to leave a message in town

49
00:02:00.533 --> 00:02:03.700
So crazy are you kidding me
