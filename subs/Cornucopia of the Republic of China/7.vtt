00:00:01.733 --> 00:00:03.266
Hahahaha

2
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:04.966
Brother, I admire it.

3
00:00:04.966 --> 00:00:07.200
You can easily take out so many medicines

4
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.600
Hey, are you anything special?

5
00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:11.366
Hey, this, big brother

6
00:00:11.366 --> 00:00:13.500
What about this medicine? I've given it all to you.

7
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.566
I don't have it for the time being.

8
00:00:15.566 --> 00:00:17.300
Oh, don't get me wrong.

9
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:19.900
Coming to the dignified teacher will not take advantage of you

10
00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.266
I took all the money you have.

11
00:00:22.266 --> 00:00:24.266
Money is not a problem

12
00:00:24.333 --> 00:00:25.400
Hahaha

13
00:00:25.466 --> 00:00:27.666
Of course this is no problem. Uh, it will wait for two days.

14
00:00:27.666 --> 00:00:29.866
I'll refine some more

15
00:00:30.166 --> 00:00:31.566
Bring the money for the medicine

16
00:00:32.933 --> 00:00:34.600
Not 200 bucks

17
00:00:37.933 --> 00:00:39.100
This is enough

18
00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:39.900
Ah!

19
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.000
Hahaha brother

20
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.300
I want to save people

21
00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:45.700
It's so fucking bad-tempered

22
00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:46.500
Is that so?

23
00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.166
Let's just worship and follow my brother

24
00:00:49.166 --> 00:00:51.100
I made you a brigade commander, but you don't like it

25
00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:53.733
Hahaha, thank you for your kindness, big brother.

26
00:00:53.733 --> 00:00:55.600
I don't want to participate yet.

27
00:00:56.766 --> 00:00:58.066
We're at war.

28
00:00:58.066 --> 00:00:59.566
It's a dangerous battle

29
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.100
I just need troop protection

30
00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.400
Temporarily have no intention of entering Taishan

31
00:01:03.566 --> 00:01:04.666
Is it okay?

32
00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:07.700
Do you want to come that day and tell my brother?

33
00:01:07.733 --> 00:01:08.533
OK

34
00:01:09.066 --> 00:01:09.866
Bring me some wine!

35
00:01:09.866 --> 00:01:12.366
Today, let's get drunk and rest

36
00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.366
Hahaha dry

37
00:01:18.866 --> 00:01:20.100
Oops fuck

38
00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.633
It's boring to just drink

39
00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.900
Just drink

40
00:01:42.766 --> 00:01:44.500
Come on, big brother.

41
00:01:45.533 --> 00:01:46.800
I toast you

42
00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:50.300
I have to.

43
00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:51.766
Dry, dry, dry.

44
00:02:09.666 --> 00:02:11.166
Xiao Er

45
00:02:11.166 --> 00:02:13.800
Have a glass of water, okay, guest officer

46
00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:14.733
Your water

47
00:02:14.733 --> 00:02:15.400
Three oceans

48
00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:16.800
Please leave it here and wait for me.

49
00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:17.666
Wait a minute.

50
00:02:18.766 --> 00:02:21.066
You want three oceans for this glass of water

51
00:02:21.466 --> 00:02:24.033
Xiao Er, where are you robbing? Here
