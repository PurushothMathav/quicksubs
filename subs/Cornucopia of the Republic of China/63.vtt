00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.700
Li Jiaren's defector

2
00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:03.900
I haven't asked you yet

3
00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:05.533
You asked us first

4
00:00:05.533 --> 00:00:08.200
Believe it or not, I won't let you get out of this Jinshan Town

5
00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:11.266
Enough, the Li family is a normal interview

6
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.433
And it's not Wu Tian who explained to me

7
00:00:13.766 --> 00:00:14.966
Let's get back to you

8
00:00:14.966 --> 00:00:16.633
If the explanation is not clear

9
00:00:16.733 --> 00:00:18.166
Just waiting to get drunk

10
00:00:18.166 --> 00:00:21.266
Which crime did I commit and invite you to eat?

11
00:00:21.366 --> 00:00:22.633
I'll tell you what.

12
00:00:22.866 --> 00:00:24.066
You kill people

13
00:00:24.066 --> 00:00:25.300
Robbing people of talent

14
00:00:25.466 --> 00:00:28.266
In the calamity grain, ginseng kills grass and traitors

15
00:00:28.366 --> 00:00:29.766
You will kill you

16
00:00:29.766 --> 00:00:31.800
These things don't exist.

17
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.966
Mayor Wu put sand in the porridge

18
00:00:33.966 --> 00:00:35.700
But I saw it with my own eyes

19
00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.366
You question this official

20
00:00:37.366 --> 00:00:39.900
No, aren't you articulate?

21
00:00:39.933 --> 00:00:41.366
I said it, Zhan Guan

22
00:00:41.766 --> 00:00:43.433
Put sand in the grain

23
00:00:43.466 --> 00:00:44.900
It's not for carelessness

24
00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:46.666
But to stop the great sword

25
00:00:46.766 --> 00:00:47.866
Otherwise

26
00:00:47.966 --> 00:00:50.433
Then there is no food at all now

27
00:00:51.166 --> 00:00:52.166
Nonsense

28
00:00:52.766 --> 00:00:55.366
Sir, since he has already explained

29
00:00:55.566 --> 00:00:56.700
I'll save you from the Fa

30
00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:59.433
You scare people, you treat people against your rules

31
00:00:59.666 --> 00:01:01.766
It is a heinous crime for you to read me

32
00:01:01.933 --> 00:01:02.766
I am a theorist

33
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.866
It should be your brother Politics and Law

34
00:01:04.933 --> 00:01:06.966
Okay, stop arguing

35
00:01:06.966 --> 00:01:09.500
Wu Tian, although you have your own reasons

36
00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:10.666
Penalty or less?

37
00:01:10.666 --> 00:01:13.000
No sir can't disturb him

38
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.766
Wu Tian took advantage of natural disasters to amass wealth

39
00:01:14.766 --> 00:01:15.866
Oppressed many people

40
00:01:15.866 --> 00:01:17.033
It's a terrible crime.

41
00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.800
Li Jiaren, you keep saying that I oppress the people

42
00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:21.866
Have you had any evidence?

43
00:01:21.866 --> 00:01:23.300
Of course I have proof

44
00:01:23.566 --> 00:01:25.066
When I Li Jiang was there

45
00:01:25.066 --> 00:01:26.566
The common people are prosperous

46
00:01:26.733 --> 00:01:27.900
You go everywhere.

47
00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.033
The common people are blown up by you

48
00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.166
We just need to go to other people to see and we'll know everything.
