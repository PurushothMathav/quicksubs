00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.866
Hey, Mr. Second Brother, please stay

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.366
Yes, I really want to do business with you.

3
00:00:05.366 --> 00:00:06.833
If he doesn't respect me

4
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:08.566
I can't talk to someone like that

5
00:00:08.566 --> 00:00:09.466
As far as I know

6
00:00:09.966 --> 00:00:12.266
Mr. Second's project lost money in the year

7
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:13.700
And deep in debt

8
00:00:13.933 --> 00:00:15.900
You leave here today

9
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.166
Your factory must have

10
00:00:18.166 --> 00:00:20.433
If you want to bury my armory factory

11
00:00:20.666 --> 00:00:22.766
I want a gold building

12
00:00:22.766 --> 00:00:24.966
Sure. But I have a request.

13
00:00:24.966 --> 00:00:26.800
All technologies must be sold

14
00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:27.833
That's impossible.

15
00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.166
My skills won't be buried by yellow-skinned monkeys

16
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.000
Then we have nothing to talk about.

17
00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:33.400
Please code

18
00:00:34.766 --> 00:00:35.800
How about this?

19
00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.000
I can buy you a weapon

20
00:00:38.533 --> 00:00:39.900
A little discount on the price.

21
00:00:39.966 --> 00:00:41.066
I'm not interested.

22
00:00:41.566 --> 00:00:43.866
Your weapons are not the latest

23
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.233
I don't need it.

24
00:00:45.666 --> 00:00:47.400
I just lack Wugang

25
00:00:47.466 --> 00:00:49.400
If I live enough Wugang

26
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.866
It must be able to create the most advanced weapons

27
00:00:51.866 --> 00:00:54.633
If I could give you enough Wugang

28
00:00:55.333 --> 00:00:58.166
You hahahaha

29
00:00:58.166 --> 00:00:58.966
Obviously

30
00:00:58.966 --> 00:01:01.500
You don't even know what martial arts are

31
00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:02.900
I'm not interested in knowing

32
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.900
But I can give you

33
00:01:04.966 --> 00:01:06.366
I don't like jokes.

34
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.000
As a noble race

35
00:01:08.066 --> 00:01:10.766
My willingness to make suggestions is enough

36
00:01:10.766 --> 00:01:13.100
You might as well think about it.

37
00:01:13.366 --> 00:01:14.933
You didn't have a better choice.

38
00:01:14.933 --> 00:01:18.866
That is, we are not qualified to become Huang Zhongren, right?

39
00:01:19.966 --> 00:01:20.800
Okay

40
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.033
Oh buy kah

41
00:01:25.566 --> 00:01:26.700
So many complaints

42
00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.833
How can you use so many accusations?

43
00:01:30.333 --> 00:01:31.700
I don't have to tell you.

44
00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.333
You just need to know that I have countless

45
00:01:34.333 --> 00:01:35.433
That's not a statement.
