00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:01.800
Come on, second young master

2
00:00:01.933 --> 00:00:04.100
Second young master, let me go, I don't know

3
00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:05.200
Believe it or not, this young master's words

4
00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:06.466
Make you unable to drink water for a lifetime

5
00:00:06.466 --> 00:00:08.433
Second Young Master, you have a lot of money

6
00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:09.900
Why bother with us?

7
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.166
Do you know

8
00:00:11.166 --> 00:00:13.500
How many women enjoy this little bed?

9
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:14.900
As long as you are willing to follow me

10
00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:17.266
In the future, you will have whatever you want

11
00:00:17.266 --> 00:00:19.566
Come on, let's play in the house

12
00:00:19.566 --> 00:00:21.300
Come on, oops, second young master

13
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:22.966
In the hands of the second young master, I still want to fly

14
00:00:22.966 --> 00:00:25.033
Stop dreaming

15
00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:27.800
Robbing folk girls in broad daylight

16
00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:28.700
Is there any other way?

17
00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:30.100
Brother Wu, hurry up and leave

18
00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:32.900
Don't worry about me, you kid still want a hero to save the beauty

19
00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:34.933
Can you control dogs and mice?

20
00:00:34.933 --> 00:00:36.833
Zhang Shao, why is it you?

21
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:37.966
What Zhang Shao

22
00:00:37.966 --> 00:00:38.766
Lao Tzu's surname is Li

23
00:00:38.766 --> 00:00:41.366
The second young master of the Li family opened your dog eyes to see clearly

24
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.400
It looks like a human

25
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.000
Probably not alone

26
00:00:46.566 --> 00:00:47.400
I'll tell you what.

27
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.400
I'm sure you don't have to run for this nosey today

28
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:51.700
As long as I'm here today

29
00:00:51.766 --> 00:00:52.900
No one can take it away

30
00:00:52.966 --> 00:00:55.233
Where are we going?

31
00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:56.700
You can go

32
00:00:56.733 --> 00:00:59.166
But he left. I bought him.

33
00:00:59.166 --> 00:01:00.500
Don't go anywhere

34
00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.600
Second young master, I can redeem him

35
00:01:02.933 --> 00:01:05.300
Do you think these oceans are enough?

36
00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.166
Just this money

37
00:01:09.333 --> 00:01:11.933
Do you know how much a bucket of water is worth to me?

38
00:01:11.933 --> 00:01:14.066
Second Young Master, can I kneel down for you?

39
00:01:14.166 --> 00:01:15.133
No matter how much water

40
00:01:15.133 --> 00:01:16.533
I will definitely pay you back in the future.

41
00:01:16.533 --> 00:01:18.700
What are you doing kneeling down for this kind of person? Isn't it just water?

42
00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:19.600
I pay for him

43
00:01:19.733 --> 00:01:21.300
Brother Hu, how can you do this?

44
00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:22.100
You're welcome. What?

45
00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.533
Water is nothing to me

46
00:01:24.533 --> 00:01:26.266
I can have as many as I want.
