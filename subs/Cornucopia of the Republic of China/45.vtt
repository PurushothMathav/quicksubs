00:00:00.066 --> 00:00:00.533
Nice

2
00:00:00.533 --> 00:00:02.600
The food we eat now is priceless

3
00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:03.766
And you can't forget that.

4
00:00:03.766 --> 00:00:06.166
Oh, really take out the food, I naturally don't understand

5
00:00:06.166 --> 00:00:08.066
It's okay for them to be mayors

6
00:00:08.166 --> 00:00:09.933
Don't just listen to his bragging here.

7
00:00:09.933 --> 00:00:11.466
I really thought he was as rich as any other country.

8
00:00:11.466 --> 00:00:13.766
He is priceless even if he takes out all the food

9
00:00:13.766 --> 00:00:15.266
It's not enough for us to eat for four or three days

10
00:00:15.266 --> 00:00:17.666
Yes, since sooner or later we will defeat mourning

11
00:00:17.666 --> 00:00:19.466
It's better to leave early

12
00:00:19.733 --> 00:00:21.600
Agree to go, I'll see who dares to go

13
00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:23.066
What do you want?

14
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.700
People who want to leave leave leave others

15
00:00:26.266 --> 00:00:27.900
Wang doesn't care what I said

16
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.466
Don't stop him from doing it

17
00:00:29.466 --> 00:00:30.466
Are you confused?

18
00:00:30.466 --> 00:00:32.300
Once they're gone, the first thing they do is fly away.

19
00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:34.000
If you leave early, it's all over

20
00:00:34.266 --> 00:00:35.166
It's going to rain

21
00:00:35.166 --> 00:00:36.200
You still want to get married

22
00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.100
Those who want to leave are too lazy to live

23
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.300
It's better to get together and disperse

24
00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:39.900
package regardless

25
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.366
You go and ask how many people are under your command

26
00:00:42.366 --> 00:00:43.166
Want to leave

27
00:00:43.166 --> 00:00:45.200
The chairperson was ambushed by a traitor

28
00:00:45.366 --> 00:00:46.200
Seriously injured

29
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.966
Before he died, he dragged me to take care of the brothers

30
00:00:48.966 --> 00:00:50.200
It's a pity that I'm incompetent

31
00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.000
There are many brothers

32
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.966
Anyone who wants to leave, please

33
00:00:57.166 --> 00:01:00.266
Brothers, the leader is dead and the food is gone

34
00:01:00.266 --> 00:01:01.300
What else do you want?

35
00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:02.333
No, follow me.

36
00:01:02.333 --> 00:01:03.966
You're going to die.

37
00:01:04.333 --> 00:01:05.166
I go

38
00:01:05.966 --> 00:01:07.100
I'm leaving too

39
00:01:08.533 --> 00:01:10.666
Okay. Anybody else going?

40
00:01:11.366 --> 00:01:13.800
I have walked I get off

41
00:01:14.166 --> 00:01:15.833
This half of my youth is gone

42
00:01:15.866 --> 00:01:17.366
What do we do now?

43
00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:18.566
I have a way
