00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:01.066
Sir?

2
00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:03.333
This must have been arranged by Wu Tian

3
00:00:03.333 --> 00:00:06.666
Li Jiaren, you picked this family?

4
00:00:06.666 --> 00:00:08.100
If you don't believe me

5
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:09.800
You can search it boldly.

6
00:00:09.866 --> 00:00:11.100
Maybe there are some more

7
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:12.766
What about the hidden clues?

8
00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:16.666
This rice doesn't mean anything

9
00:00:16.866 --> 00:00:19.600
Wu Tian must have caught it in advance to fool us.

10
00:00:19.933 --> 00:00:21.933
Please search carefully

11
00:00:21.933 --> 00:00:24.233
There are still unfinished strawberry barks hidden in the house

12
00:00:24.333 --> 00:00:25.200
Yes

13
00:00:31.533 --> 00:00:33.866
Report a business trip with two fish

14
00:00:33.866 --> 00:00:35.433
There are still fish to eat

15
00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:36.900
Your grandmother's

16
00:00:36.933 --> 00:00:38.400
It's better than what I eat.

17
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.966
Sir, this is all from Mayor Wu

18
00:00:40.966 --> 00:00:43.633
I promise every word is true Li Jiaren

19
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.333
This is the evidence that you said he oppressed the people

20
00:00:46.333 --> 00:00:47.766
That's impossible.

21
00:00:48.366 --> 00:00:50.266
The town was ransacked by my Li family

22
00:00:50.266 --> 00:00:51.266
Why are there still fish?

23
00:00:51.266 --> 00:00:53.333
What do you mean by this family?

24
00:00:53.333 --> 00:00:55.433
Sir, listen to me explain

25
00:00:55.466 --> 00:00:57.566
Must this be a misunderstanding, sir?

26
00:00:58.366 --> 00:01:00.633
His fox tail is already showing

27
00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.700
Can we talk like this?

28
00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:04.866
I have something to report to you.

29
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.166
Sir, sir, listen to my explanation

30
00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.166
Looser, yeah.

31
00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.566
Mayor Wu, you just said that you have something important to report.

32
00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:22.666
What's the matter?

33
00:01:22.766 --> 00:01:24.566
Sir, come and sit

34
00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:28.766
Sir, what about this time?

35
00:01:28.933 --> 00:01:30.666
Just bother you

36
00:01:30.666 --> 00:01:32.533
That's a little bit of fare.

37
00:01:32.533 --> 00:01:34.733
I hope the sir will accept it

38
00:01:34.733 --> 00:01:35.633
I want to refuse

39
00:01:35.766 --> 00:01:38.266
Mayor Wu, who do you think I am?

40
00:01:38.333 --> 00:01:39.666
This official is in power

41
00:01:39.733 --> 00:01:41.033
Why would I take your money?

42
00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:42.300
gold

43
00:01:42.733 --> 00:01:43.600
Gold bar

44
00:01:44.266 --> 00:01:46.966
Oh, I wasn't thoughtful.

45
00:01:47.266 --> 00:01:49.366
Since the officer blamed it

46
00:01:49.533 --> 00:01:53.566
Then what I just said doesn't count

47
00:01:54.366 --> 00:01:55.700
I said you

48
00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.766
Why can't you even make a joke?

49
00:01:57.766 --> 00:02:00.866
Hahaha, come, come and eat, eat vegetables

50
00:02:00.866 --> 00:02:02.500
Sit down, Xiao Guo

51
00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:03.866
Come touch one

52
00:02:08.266 --> 00:02:09.766
Come eat out

53
00:02:09.766 --> 00:02:11.633
Hahaha come come come come
