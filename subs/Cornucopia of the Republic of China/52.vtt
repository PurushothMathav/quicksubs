00:00:06.466 --> 00:00:08.466
Let me eat this

2
00:00:09.266 --> 00:00:10.400
Is there nothing else to eat?

3
00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.933
Zhang Shuai, our military supplies are also in short supply

4
00:00:12.933 --> 00:00:14.633
That's all that's left now.

5
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.566
There are still many brothers down there who have not eaten

6
00:00:16.566 --> 00:00:18.266
It's already gnawing at the bark

7
00:00:20.066 --> 00:00:21.433
What battle did you fight?

8
00:00:22.533 --> 00:00:23.433
waste

9
00:00:24.166 --> 00:00:25.500
Bunch of trash

10
00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.900
What's that smell?

11
00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.166
Where did that smell come from?

12
00:00:37.166 --> 00:00:39.666
Zhang Shuai, someone seems to be cooking outside

13
00:00:39.666 --> 00:00:40.600
It's like this.

14
00:00:52.066 --> 00:00:53.166
Who is cooking?

15
00:00:53.166 --> 00:00:55.200
Sir, no one is cooking?

16
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.533
Where did this smell come from?

17
00:00:56.533 --> 00:00:59.766
Sir, the smell seems to be from the Qin family town

18
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.366
Brothers

19
00:01:15.466 --> 00:01:18.200
I heard that everyone is tired of eating buns recently.

20
00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.800
Today I will take the big guys to improve the food

21
00:01:21.933 --> 00:01:24.000
Everyone just let go and eat

22
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.466
Yes, it's so good. I've never eaten it before.

23
00:01:25.466 --> 00:01:26.733
Can you save some for tomorrow?

24
00:01:26.733 --> 00:01:28.600
Don't worry about that.

25
00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.800
The last thing I need is food

26
00:01:31.066 --> 00:01:32.066
Finished eating today

27
00:01:32.066 --> 00:01:33.933
Let's eat tomorrow

28
00:01:33.933 --> 00:01:36.000
Eat until the war is over

29
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.500
Long live the teacher

30
00:01:37.533 --> 00:01:39.366
Long live the Tianbao family
