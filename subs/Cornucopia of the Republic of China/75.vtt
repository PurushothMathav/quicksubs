00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:01.133
Lili

2
00:00:01.666 --> 00:00:03.100
What do you mean by that?

3
00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:04.066
Don't worry about the goblin

4
00:00:04.066 --> 00:00:04.966
Even for you

5
00:00:04.966 --> 00:00:06.800
I also want to uncover the true face of this person

6
00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:08.766
Lily speak loudly

7
00:00:08.866 --> 00:00:11.000
Li Shuai and the others will support us

8
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.166
Wu Tian, you want to deceive people by swaggering

9
00:00:14.166 --> 00:00:14.966
It's useless.

10
00:00:14.966 --> 00:00:15.900
I advise you

11
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.500
Better apologize quickly

12
00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:20.466
Well, it's good for you and my cousin

13
00:00:20.466 --> 00:00:22.000
You think too much.

14
00:00:22.066 --> 00:00:23.866
I have never deceived anyone.

15
00:00:23.866 --> 00:00:25.166
You want me to break it?

16
00:00:25.333 --> 00:00:27.133
You get someone to pretend to be Mr. Raul

17
00:00:27.133 --> 00:00:29.200
Isn't it just for the fans' own lies?

18
00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.333
Unfortunately, I have been to the sunset

19
00:00:31.333 --> 00:00:32.933
You lied to others.

20
00:00:32.933 --> 00:00:34.900
But you can't fool me

21
00:00:35.366 --> 00:00:38.266
He dared to find someone to pretend to be Mr. Raul

22
00:00:38.266 --> 00:00:40.166
Don't eat to death

23
00:00:40.166 --> 00:00:43.166
Wu Tian, you are not qualified to be a force

24
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.333
Go to Mr. Raul immediately and kneel down and apologize to him

25
00:00:47.333 --> 00:00:49.866
My brother, how could you do such a thing?

26
00:00:49.866 --> 00:00:51.600
This is too serious.

27
00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:53.900
I'm afraid the marshal can't keep his energy

28
00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:55.300
Just ridiculous

29
00:00:55.666 --> 00:00:57.066
Just an old ear

30
00:00:57.266 --> 00:00:58.800
Why should I talk to someone?

31
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.866
He is an adult you cannot afford to offend

32
00:01:00.866 --> 00:01:02.266
But in my eyes

33
00:01:02.466 --> 00:01:04.000
It's worthless.

34
00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.600
Wu Tian, you are suicidal

35
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.666
Take back what you just said immediately

36
00:01:09.766 --> 00:01:12.866
Wu Tian, you have no idea what you are talking about

37
00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.133
I don't think it's his official

38
00:01:15.133 --> 00:01:17.500
Wait for Mr. Raul to send it

39
00:01:18.966 --> 00:01:21.300
You don't cherish the last chance

40
00:01:21.466 --> 00:01:23.000
You really let me down.

41
00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:24.900
Mr. Raul arrives

42
00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.000
Today is a grand day

43
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.100
I didn't expect so many people.

44
00:01:30.133 --> 00:01:31.500
It's so hilarious
