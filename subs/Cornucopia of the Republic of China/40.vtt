00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.800
What the hell did you say?

2
00:00:02.366 --> 00:00:04.333
The eldest young master said that the attack was blocked.

3
00:00:04.333 --> 00:00:05.900
He can't get in

4
00:00:06.266 --> 00:00:07.466
Let's run for our lives

5
00:00:07.466 --> 00:00:08.700
I'll go to your mom

6
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:09.833
Full of nonsense

7
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:10.900
full body curvature

8
00:00:12.533 --> 00:00:14.233
This is the handwritten department of the eldest young master

9
00:00:20.766 --> 00:00:22.733
Li Jiahao, hurry up and let me go

10
00:00:22.733 --> 00:00:24.566
What should the second young master do now?

11
00:00:24.566 --> 00:00:25.366
or

12
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.400
Why don't we let him go?

13
00:00:30.333 --> 00:00:33.600
It's not scary, the surname Wu won't let us go

14
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.900
Take the hostage and fight for the surnamed Wen, let me go

15
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.566
No one, hurry back to Lao Tzu

16
00:00:40.566 --> 00:00:41.800
Or I will attack him

17
00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.766
Lao Yan, don't worry about me, save the villagers first

18
00:00:44.866 --> 00:00:45.866
Li Jiahao

19
00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:47.733
Make a fuss about a woman

20
00:00:47.733 --> 00:00:49.133
What the hell kind of man are you?

21
00:00:49.133 --> 00:00:50.966
It's not my father who asked you if you would return it or not.

22
00:00:50.966 --> 00:00:52.300
If you don't return it, I'll shoot

23
00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:53.766
I don't want to surrender

24
00:00:53.766 --> 00:00:54.800
You let us surrender

25
00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:56.466
You can't surrender!

26
00:00:56.566 --> 00:00:57.766
Married to Lao Tzu

27
00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:59.800
Second Young Master, when is this?

28
00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.733
We see this little girl, we surrender

29
00:01:01.733 --> 00:01:04.566
I'm going to your mother to squat and surrender, put the knife under the tip

30
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.133
Second Young Master, we can't escape

31
00:01:08.133 --> 00:01:11.100
Resisting any longer is a dead end

32
00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.966
Dog, you dare to betray me

33
00:01:13.966 --> 00:01:16.100
Second young master, it's not my fault

34
00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:17.966
If you want to surrender, you have to vote

35
00:01:17.966 --> 00:01:19.066
Don't you move

36
00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.166
I accidentally hurt you, what should I do?

37
00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:22.633
Big jump I take it

38
00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:27.300
I'm honest
