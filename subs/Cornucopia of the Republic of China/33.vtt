1
00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:01.300
If he can't get anything out

2
00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:03.366
We quickly pry him in the arm with a gun

3
00:00:03.666 --> 00:00:06.066
Sir, your income is too high

4
00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:08.200
You have a lot to learn.

5
00:00:08.966 --> 00:00:10.300
Like this one.

6
00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:11.566
What do you two offer?

7
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:13.133
Why didn't you schedule the surgery?

8
00:00:13.133 --> 00:00:15.300
Damn it, blow your nose on your face, right?

9
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:17.700
You dare to order me to be killed, wait a minute

10
00:00:20.733 --> 00:00:22.066
You burned these things

11
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:23.100
How did you burn it?

12
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.300
I have something ready.

13
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.966
If it's not enough, come to me again.

14
00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.266
His grandmother, are you a medicine cabbage?

15
00:00:33.566 --> 00:00:34.633
Wait a minute.

16
00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:37.466
I'll check first

17
00:00:38.533 --> 00:00:40.366
If he dares to lie to me

18
00:00:47.933 --> 00:00:49.566
These are all from your employer

19
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.000
Where did he get such a thing

20
00:00:51.533 --> 00:00:53.433
Our employer even buys and sells military work

21
00:00:53.966 --> 00:00:55.800
How many bottles of potions will you need?

22
00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:58.766
Thank you very much for me

23
00:00:58.766 --> 00:00:59.900
Yeah, tell him.

24
00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:01.300
I will definitely rescue Zhang Yuan well

25
00:01:01.766 --> 00:01:03.000
That's more like it.

26
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.966
Just find me if you have anything in the future

27
00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:08.900
Sir, this family is too arrogant

28
00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:09.666
Why don't you teach him a lesson?

29
00:01:09.666 --> 00:01:10.866
Shut up shut up

30
00:01:11.666 --> 00:01:12.633
block

31
00:01:13.266 --> 00:01:14.066
disrespect

32
00:01:15.533 --> 00:01:16.666
Never offend

33
00:01:16.866 --> 00:01:19.500
Otherwise you don't know how you died

34
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:20.733
Is it that serious?

35
00:01:20.733 --> 00:01:22.700
Something that even the teacher can't get

36
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.300
They can get it.

37
00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:25.766
Do you think it's an ordinary person?

38
00:01:26.166 --> 00:01:27.400
Tell the people of Xiamen

39
00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.366
Keep a low profile

40
00:01:32.733 --> 00:01:33.900
Brother opposite

41
00:01:34.266 --> 00:01:37.033
You have been surrounded by an army called out

42
00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:38.266
Except surrender

43
00:01:38.533 --> 00:01:40.066
There is no other way.

44
00:01:40.066 --> 00:01:41.866
I'm going to give you a chance.

45
00:01:41.866 --> 00:01:43.066
voluntary submission

46
00:01:43.066 --> 00:01:44.266
Surrender
