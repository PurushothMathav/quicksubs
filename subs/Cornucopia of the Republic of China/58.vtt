00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.200
Teacher, how much money do you have?

2
00:00:03.666 --> 00:00:04.900
Money is not a problem

3
00:00:05.166 --> 00:00:06.766
So I'm going to ask you if you can do that.

4
00:00:06.966 --> 00:00:09.000
Teacher, since the money problem has been solved

5
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.133
That leaves the negotiation

6
00:00:10.133 --> 00:00:12.900
No, it's going to take a while

7
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.466
Then I'll leave this matter to you.

8
00:00:16.766 --> 00:00:17.566
Play more every month

9
00:00:17.566 --> 00:00:18.266
I have no children.

10
00:00:18.266 --> 00:00:20.000
Go away, didn't you hear?

11
00:00:20.733 --> 00:00:22.566
Where do they get the food spirit?

12
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.833
Don't think about it, it must be the food of the sky

13
00:00:25.966 --> 00:00:28.033
He's so damn rich!

14
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:29.566
What about our plan?

15
00:00:29.866 --> 00:00:31.300
Wouldn't that fail?

16
00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.433
What failed?

17
00:00:33.766 --> 00:00:35.033
After today

18
00:00:35.133 --> 00:00:36.966
Let the brothers eat porridge

19
00:00:36.966 --> 00:00:38.833
Eat up Wu Tian's food sooner or later

20
00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:40.800
Commander, this is a good idea

21
00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:43.000
Zhang Shuai must praise you

22
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.433
Otherwise, how could I be the leader?

23
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.566
Let Wu Tian help me raise a team

24
00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:49.633
Wake up laughing at night

25
00:00:51.966 --> 00:00:55.066
Boss, you said that since we have no shortage of food

26
00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:57.800
Why add sand to the porridge?

27
00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:58.666
Xiao He

28
00:00:59.333 --> 00:01:00.133
This

29
00:01:00.866 --> 00:01:02.233
People are evil.

30
00:01:02.466 --> 00:01:04.400
If you don't put sand in your hands

31
00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:05.666
Those real disasters

32
00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:07.266
But never eat food

33
00:01:07.366 --> 00:01:09.466
Well, I seem to understand a little bit.

34
00:01:09.733 --> 00:01:10.966
Got it, why are you still standing?

35
00:01:10.966 --> 00:01:11.766
stand at attention

36
00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.166
Turn back

37
00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:16.966
run walk

38
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.400
It's not dark yet.

39
00:01:26.466 --> 00:01:27.966
Miss me so soon

40
00:01:28.933 --> 00:01:30.233
Don't mess around

41
00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:31.800
It's a letter from my cousin

42
00:01:31.933 --> 00:01:32.566
Say my uncle

43
00:01:32.566 --> 00:01:35.066
The family is coming to Qingshan Town to stay for a while

44
00:01:35.066 --> 00:01:36.800
Let my mom come then
