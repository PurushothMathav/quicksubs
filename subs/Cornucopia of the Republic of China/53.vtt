00:00:03.133 --> 00:00:05.600
Wu Tian, this grandson must have done it on purpose

2
00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.700
Zhang Shuai, why don't you call now?

3
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.500
Call me the Li family

4
00:00:15.666 --> 00:00:18.233
Zhang Shuai, when will their food run out?

5
00:00:18.366 --> 00:00:20.000
When will you finish drinking?

6
00:00:20.366 --> 00:00:22.333
Zhang Shuai, I can guarantee it.

7
00:00:22.333 --> 00:00:24.566
The food on the opposite side will be used up soon.

8
00:00:24.566 --> 00:00:25.733
Let's persevere.

9
00:00:25.733 --> 00:00:26.900
Just hold on.

10
00:00:26.966 --> 00:00:28.666
Victory is definitely ours

11
00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:30.433
OK, I'm sure.

12
00:00:30.766 --> 00:00:31.600
Wait a minute.

13
00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:33.500
Wait a minute.

14
00:00:35.333 --> 00:00:37.800
I had to copy your house for 5 days

15
00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:42.600
Be ready for me

16
00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:45.100
Why haven't I finished my meal yet?

17
00:00:45.366 --> 00:00:47.633
It's your uncle, get over there

18
00:00:53.533 --> 00:00:54.333
Li Jiaren

19
00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.466
Are you sure they've run out of food?

20
00:00:57.466 --> 00:00:58.700
We can win

21
00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:00.966
Zhang Shuai has been there for three days

22
00:01:00.966 --> 00:01:02.100
I can guarantee it.

23
00:01:02.266 --> 00:01:04.266
There's nothing left to eat.

24
00:01:04.566 --> 00:01:07.833
This is our time to win

25
00:01:08.333 --> 00:01:10.033
I will take Wu Tian

26
00:01:10.266 --> 00:01:12.833
I must let him taste the taste of Lao Tzu these days

27
00:01:13.133 --> 00:01:14.566
Hmm, that's right

28
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.466
Zhang Shuai, I will help you teach him a lesson when the time comes.

29
00:01:21.333 --> 00:01:22.133
What's that?

30
00:01:31.566 --> 00:01:32.366
come

31
00:01:33.733 --> 00:01:34.600
Come come

32
00:01:37.366 --> 00:01:39.366
It's started hahaha

33
00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.400
Hello, fellow citizens.

34
00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.900
Have you eaten?

35
00:01:48.933 --> 00:01:51.500
What the hell is going on, villain?

36
00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.633
Didn't you say they ran out of food?
