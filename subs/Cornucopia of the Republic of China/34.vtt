00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:04.300
Who is yelling across from the big brother?

2
00:00:04.866 --> 00:00:06.300
It's Li Jiaren, the traitor

3
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:07.733
If it weren't for the blood-burning pill king before

4
00:00:07.733 --> 00:00:10.000
How could he be so rampant?

5
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.266
Please come and have a look.

6
00:00:11.266 --> 00:00:13.400
Just to let you see this kid with your own eyes

7
00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:14.500
How did you die?

8
00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:15.800
That being the case

9
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:16.733
I can't miss it

10
00:00:16.733 --> 00:00:17.633
That's kind

11
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.666
Let's be short of guys

12
00:00:20.666 --> 00:00:22.400
But you can't let the other party be so rampant

13
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.266
Brother, don't worry.

14
00:00:24.266 --> 00:00:25.533
I brought a batch of ammunition

15
00:00:25.533 --> 00:00:26.366
The quantity is large enough

16
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.066
You ask someone to distribute it.

17
00:00:40.466 --> 00:00:41.600
It's the pill you sent

18
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:43.500
Where did the mayor get this pill?

19
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.066
I heard about his mother

20
00:00:45.066 --> 00:00:46.500
Don't worry about this for now.

21
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:47.300
Give it to me right away

22
00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:48.966
If you dare to die, just talk to Pantu

23
00:00:49.266 --> 00:00:50.766
Commander, I promise to perfect the task

24
00:00:50.766 --> 00:00:52.166
The traitor has been killed

25
00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:58.533
Give you another 10 minutes

26
00:00:58.533 --> 00:00:59.833
If you don't surrender

27
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.566
The recruited army went in

28
00:01:01.566 --> 00:01:02.900
Let you leave no grass

29
00:01:06.866 --> 00:01:07.833
Dog stuff

30
00:01:08.466 --> 00:01:09.966
Still have the face to persuade Yang

31
00:01:10.366 --> 00:01:11.766
Drop your weapon now

32
00:01:12.066 --> 00:01:13.200
Surrender quickly

33
00:01:13.466 --> 00:01:16.800
Hahaha, it's you bastard

34
00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.966
If you want me to die, you have to have this ability.

35
00:01:20.066 --> 00:01:22.366
You don't even have a bullet to kill me

36
00:01:22.366 --> 00:01:24.300
Hahahahaha

37
00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:25.666
Then what are you afraid of?

38
00:01:25.933 --> 00:01:27.066
Why don't you dare to come?

39
00:01:29.466 --> 00:01:31.700
75 big father will fulfill you

40
00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.233
If you have this ability

41
00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.900
I'll give you this head. Okay.

42
00:01:36.366 --> 00:01:37.900
I want the captain

43
00:01:38.066 --> 00:01:39.600
Is it useful for you to be so arrogant?

44
00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:40.900
Or you'd better step back

45
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.066
You're too dangerous

46
00:01:43.466 --> 00:01:44.400
What are you afraid of?

47
00:01:44.733 --> 00:01:46.866
I just want to hit their psychological defense line

48
00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.566
Come on, hit me

49
00:01:49.666 --> 00:01:51.200
Hit me if you can

50
00:01:51.866 --> 00:01:54.066
Big brother is ready

51
00:01:55.933 --> 00:01:56.733
sit
