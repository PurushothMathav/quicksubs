00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.400
Be honest

2
00:00:02.566 --> 00:00:05.266
You too. Don't hit me. I can't remember

3
00:00:05.266 --> 00:00:07.366
Oops, deputy manager Wang

4
00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.566
Did you find any medicine?

5
00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:11.866
Teacher, these tricksters really don't want it

6
00:00:11.866 --> 00:00:13.800
But there's a young man who seems to have some connections

7
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:14.733
Why don't we wait?

8
00:00:14.733 --> 00:00:16.733
If you dare to take fake medicine to carry me

9
00:00:16.733 --> 00:00:19.100
I have to pull his fart

10
00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:20.233
I went to the police myself

11
00:00:21.933 --> 00:00:22.933
Don't worry about it.

12
00:00:22.933 --> 00:00:25.233
I didn't have it before, I've refined it all

13
00:00:26.466 --> 00:00:27.700
Less than an hour

14
00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:28.666
You're done

15
00:00:28.666 --> 00:00:29.900
One hour.

16
00:00:30.333 --> 00:00:31.266
Who do you look down on?

17
00:00:31.266 --> 00:00:33.666
Real men only need a minute to check

18
00:00:33.666 --> 00:00:35.200
Do you know the consequences if you fake the medicine?

19
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.833
If you know, test it.

20
00:00:37.466 --> 00:00:38.266
know

21
00:00:39.866 --> 00:00:41.866
No one is allowed to leave here until the results come out

22
00:00:42.166 --> 00:00:42.966
Take it over

23
00:00:45.866 --> 00:00:46.700
Squat down

24
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.000
big brother

25
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.200
Tell me the truth, is this medicine real?

26
00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.300
You'll find out later.

27
00:01:01.733 --> 00:01:03.300
It's over, it's over, you're killing us

28
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.966
Don't kill me. It's none of my business

29
00:01:04.966 --> 00:01:06.066
Teacher, don't be angry

30
00:01:06.066 --> 00:01:07.300
I'll handle it, I'll handle it.

31
00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.600
Can you not be angry?

32
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:10.933
He's my brother.

33
00:01:10.933 --> 00:01:13.066
How did you get on the ground?

34
00:01:13.066 --> 00:01:15.433
Is there any place at all, haha?

35
00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.800
Somebody worship this brother a chair

36
00:01:21.266 --> 00:01:23.000
Hey bro, here comes the chair

37
00:01:23.133 --> 00:01:25.366
Take a seat on the tree
