00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:01.666
Sir, what are you doing here?

2
00:00:01.666 --> 00:00:02.900
If I don't come

3
00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:05.000
I still don't know how you got a marshal

4
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.400
How much did you joke about?

5
00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.166
I-we didn't say anything

6
00:00:10.166 --> 00:00:11.500
Big Brother's sudden visit

7
00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:13.000
Honor to know

8
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.166
Sit up

9
00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.200
Don't worry, I'm here today.

10
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:17.733
There is a big one for you.

11
00:00:17.733 --> 00:00:19.066
You did a good job of disaster control

12
00:00:19.066 --> 00:00:22.166
The Grand Marshal has officially appointed you as commander

13
00:00:22.166 --> 00:00:24.333
I sent over the appointment papers

14
00:00:24.333 --> 00:00:26.133
Congratulations bro

15
00:00:26.133 --> 00:00:27.800
Identified as commander

16
00:00:28.066 --> 00:00:29.666
He has a higher status than Li Shuai

17
00:00:29.666 --> 00:00:30.966
How is that possible?

18
00:00:30.966 --> 00:00:32.333
Dad, don't panic

19
00:00:32.333 --> 00:00:34.566
This Wu Tian is probably looking for someone to act

20
00:00:34.566 --> 00:00:35.400
It's over. It's over.

21
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:36.933
This bastard is going to be commander

22
00:00:36.933 --> 00:00:38.700
I have to look at his face every day

23
00:00:38.766 --> 00:00:40.100
Big brother really keeps his word

24
00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:41.866
This gift is really grand

25
00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.366
I'll be more respectful than obedient to that little brother

26
00:00:44.366 --> 00:00:46.200
Humming what?

27
00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:48.766
You can't solve this file.

28
00:00:48.766 --> 00:00:50.800
Wutian German Pepe

29
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.166
You are not qualified to be this judge

30
00:00:53.333 --> 00:00:56.666
I don't agree with you giving up this position immediately

31
00:00:56.666 --> 00:01:00.233
The two of us will send you a Jinbei and Tiger King Gold.

32
00:01:00.566 --> 00:01:02.533
How are your conditions?

33
00:01:02.533 --> 00:01:05.066
I'm not interested in your offer

34
00:01:05.066 --> 00:01:07.433
I will decide this document

35
00:01:08.866 --> 00:01:11.000
The document was issued by the grand marshal

36
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.866
Do you even dare to disobey the orders of the grand marshal?

37
00:01:13.866 --> 00:01:14.666
Hurry up

38
00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.100
We naturally dare not disobey the order of the grand marshal

39
00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.766
But we don't accept him

40
00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.633
Regardless of his qualifications or strength

41
00:01:23.733 --> 00:01:24.900
The two of us

42
00:01:24.933 --> 00:01:27.100
Are more qualified to be this commander than him

43
00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.400
You are just my underdog

44
00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:30.800
Where did the excitement come from?

45
00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:31.900
Bury my grass

46
00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:32.700
invincible

47
00:01:33.466 --> 00:01:34.533
Show cruelty

48
00:01:34.533 --> 00:01:36.566
Why don't you tell Mr. Raul in the West?

49
00:01:36.566 --> 00:01:38.800
Has negotiated a big loan with us

50
00:01:38.966 --> 00:01:41.000
They eliminated me and almost sold it to you

51
00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.333
100,000 army

52
00:01:43.333 --> 00:01:46.666
Do you still think you are our opponent?
