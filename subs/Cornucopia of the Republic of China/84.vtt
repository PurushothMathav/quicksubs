00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:03.066
Nine laps. Well, your grandfather loves you the most.

2
00:00:03.066 --> 00:00:05.600
If he wants to teach me a lesson later

3
00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:07.466
Hear me say more good things

4
00:00:07.466 --> 00:00:09.133
Hmm grandpa

5
00:00:09.133 --> 00:00:12.200
I can't figure out why grandpa wants to hit you?

6
00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.100
Hey, don't worry so much, just take it as my way

7
00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:15.766
In addition?

8
00:00:15.766 --> 00:00:19.366
And the delivery guy has a good relationship with me

9
00:00:19.366 --> 00:00:21.466
Uh, and those two dog men and women?

10
00:00:21.466 --> 00:00:24.000
Will definitely go back to get revenge on him

11
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.100
Keep an eye out for me.

12
00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:28.166
If not, find a few people to clean them up

13
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:29.000
Yes

14
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.266
Uncle Hu is back

15
00:00:35.266 --> 00:00:38.500
He also knew that this rebellious son came back to Xiao Sun

16
00:00:39.533 --> 00:00:41.833
Go get my whip

17
00:00:44.866 --> 00:00:47.300
Ouch hello old man

18
00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.966
Hahaha, I miss you so much, haha.

19
00:00:50.966 --> 00:00:51.733
No, I don't.

20
00:00:51.733 --> 00:00:54.333
Hahaha you trespass

21
00:00:54.333 --> 00:00:56.233
Do you know that I am your father?

22
00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.500
Kneel down at such an old age

23
00:00:59.666 --> 00:01:02.366
I can't even hold the whip, so spare me this time

24
00:01:02.366 --> 00:01:04.900
Forgive me this time, hahaha.

25
00:01:04.933 --> 00:01:06.066
If you don't fight

26
00:01:07.366 --> 00:01:09.533
Go out and call for me

27
00:01:09.533 --> 00:01:11.666
If you dare to show mercy

28
00:01:11.666 --> 00:01:13.066
I even smashed you

29
00:01:15.466 --> 00:01:17.200
It's his grandfather

30
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.866
Fight grandpa

31
00:01:29.333 --> 00:01:30.566
I'm sorry.

32
00:01:32.733 --> 00:01:33.533
Ouch.

33
00:01:35.866 --> 00:01:37.033
Hello grandpa

34
00:01:37.533 --> 00:01:38.800
What did you say?

35
00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:39.700
continue

36
00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.100
Don't stop yes oops

37
00:01:43.266 --> 00:01:44.166
Xiaoshuai

38
00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.466
Just send me back for 500.

39
00:01:50.666 --> 00:01:53.033
Whoops.

40
00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:55.700
Ha ha.

41
00:01:59.566 --> 00:02:00.366
Grandpa

42
00:02:00.533 --> 00:02:03.766
Why do you keep saying 500? I don't know.

43
00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:06.400
Every time your great-grandfather beats me?

44
00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.300
He asked me to call 500.

45
00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:09.566
Ouch.

46
00:02:10.133 --> 00:02:12.233
I'm really convinced, right?

47
00:02:12.266 --> 00:02:13.066
Grandpa

48
00:02:13.533 --> 00:02:16.900
Didn't you say today that you still owe the delivery staff 500?

49
00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:18.566
What does this have to do with it?

50
00:02:18.566 --> 00:02:22.266
I just thought the delivery guy looked familiar

51
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.500
Hey, you say that?

52
00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.500
I feel familiar too

53
00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.800
Seems to have seen it somewhere

54
00:02:30.933 --> 00:02:31.733
Hey

55
00:02:33.133 --> 00:02:34.700
Why can't I remember?

56
00:02:36.966 --> 00:02:37.766
Grandpa

57
00:02:38.366 --> 00:02:39.466
What's up?

58
00:02:40.166 --> 00:02:41.466
The delivery guy?

59
00:02:41.666 --> 00:02:44.300
Why do you look exactly like the person in the photo?

60
00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:57.666
Ouch hello

61
00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.866
What the hell is this?

62
00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
How did I trap my father?

63
00:03:05.566 --> 00:03:07.566
Ah, dear.
