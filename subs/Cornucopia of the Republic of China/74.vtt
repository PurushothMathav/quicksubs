00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.000
What!

2
00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:02.933
Mr. Raul at sunset

3
00:00:02.933 --> 00:00:05.100
That is someone the grand marshal dare not offend

4
00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:06.633
How could I sell you weapons?

5
00:00:06.733 --> 00:00:08.066
In front of the goat man

6
00:00:08.066 --> 00:00:10.066
I still have some means

7
00:00:10.066 --> 00:00:10.866
Hurry up

8
00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:12.700
That's why.

9
00:00:12.766 --> 00:00:15.800
I just objected to him being the commander

10
00:00:15.866 --> 00:00:17.966
We have foreign weapons in our hands

11
00:00:17.966 --> 00:00:19.200
Look inward

12
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.966
What opponent is there?

13
00:00:21.133 --> 00:00:23.100
Mother you

14
00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:25.966
Don't fall on our heads

15
00:00:25.966 --> 00:00:28.166
Wutian before and after

16
00:00:28.166 --> 00:00:30.000
I have given you enough face.

17
00:00:30.066 --> 00:00:31.833
If you don't know any better

18
00:00:31.866 --> 00:00:33.566
At your own risk

19
00:00:34.266 --> 00:00:36.966
Brother Wu, if this is the case

20
00:00:36.966 --> 00:00:39.733
I gave you this document, but it hurt you.

21
00:00:39.733 --> 00:00:42.366
Brother, you don't have to worry about me.

22
00:00:42.366 --> 00:00:43.800
The weapons in their hands

23
00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.266
Just some eliminated hedgehogs

24
00:00:45.566 --> 00:00:48.133
And I benefited from Raul's purchase

25
00:00:48.133 --> 00:00:49.400
Just didn't expect

26
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.133
It was sold to Zhang Deshuai

27
00:00:51.133 --> 00:00:53.466
They play to your benefit

28
00:00:53.766 --> 00:00:57.700
How is this possible? Hahahahaha no.

29
00:00:57.966 --> 00:01:00.300
Are you crazy to want to be commander?

30
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.966
What is Mr. Raul's identity?

31
00:01:02.466 --> 00:01:04.100
Will it be taken by you?

32
00:01:04.566 --> 00:01:06.400
Afraid of the wind flashing my tongue

33
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.466
Wu Tian, are you talking too much?

34
00:01:08.466 --> 00:01:10.266
Mr. Ulurauer

35
00:01:10.266 --> 00:01:12.666
Is your brain broken?

36
00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:15.966
Immediately give up Li Yuan's position

37
00:01:16.266 --> 00:01:19.466
Let's just say nothing.

38
00:01:19.466 --> 00:01:22.000
How are you Li's opponent?

39
00:01:22.466 --> 00:01:23.766
back to shore

40
00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:25.300
A dead end

41
00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:27.966
Tomorrow, don't implicate us.

42
00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.366
Apologize quickly

43
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.600
Let me apologize.

44
00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.766
You can't see yourselves clearly.

45
00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.066
Believe it or not, just a word from me

46
00:01:35.533 --> 00:01:38.966
Let you dig 100,000 army

47
00:01:40.466 --> 00:01:42.966
Hu Tian, please stop acting, okay?
