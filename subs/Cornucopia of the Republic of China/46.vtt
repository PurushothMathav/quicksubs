00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:02.466
Guys, have you really thought it through?

2
00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:04.400
Make sure you're leaving, why don't you wait early?

3
00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:05.366
Don't you want to die too?

4
00:00:05.366 --> 00:00:06.733
6 times Gu Yazhu

5
00:00:06.733 --> 00:00:08.400
So many brothers follow me

6
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.766
Do I also pull half of the supplies?

7
00:00:10.766 --> 00:00:13.666
Are you confused when you bring your subordinates?

8
00:00:13.666 --> 00:00:16.266
Brothers, since you are willing to follow me

9
00:00:16.266 --> 00:00:17.500
I can't treat you badly either.

10
00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.766
Everyone sends two nest heads.

11
00:00:19.766 --> 00:00:20.700
An ocean

12
00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.833
Okay okay done

13
00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:25.566
Now the brothers are gone

14
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.500
Our brother is a bare commander

15
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.433
Don't rush to sing

16
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.233
Brothers

17
00:00:31.966 --> 00:00:33.600
Anyone who wants to stay

18
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.833
I will send 10 yuan to each person for 5 days.

19
00:00:37.066 --> 00:00:39.000
Add 10 kg of grain.

20
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.066
Add another 10 yuan a month from now on

21
00:00:42.466 --> 00:00:44.666
There are meat buns for three meals a day

22
00:00:44.966 --> 00:00:47.200
Are there any brothers who are willing to stay?

23
00:00:48.266 --> 00:00:49.833
Does what you say count?

24
00:00:55.533 --> 00:00:58.933
In the future, any brother who cannot receive money and food

25
00:00:58.933 --> 00:01:01.133
Look at my head, I'm not leaving

26
00:01:01.133 --> 00:01:02.300
Then I'm not leaving either.

27
00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:03.200
I'll get it down too

28
00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.300
I'm not leaving either

29
00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:06.200
Good Wu start

30
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.133
Or do you have a way

31
00:01:07.133 --> 00:01:08.500
Don't the brothers want to go?

32
00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:09.866
He lied to you

33
00:01:09.866 --> 00:01:11.166
How can he have so much food?

34
00:01:11.533 --> 00:01:13.200
Since no one wants to believe it

35
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.166
It's so empty.

36
00:01:14.266 --> 00:01:16.500
Xiao He took the money

37
00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.933
10 more yuan per person

38
00:01:18.933 --> 00:01:19.733
total

39
00:01:20.366 --> 00:01:21.566
20 bucks ocean

40
00:01:22.366 --> 00:01:23.666
Wow, that's a lot of money.

41
00:01:23.666 --> 00:01:24.600
Come and get the money

42
00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.066
The meat buns are open enough to eat today.
