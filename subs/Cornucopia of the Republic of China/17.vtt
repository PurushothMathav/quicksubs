1
00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:01.566
Although I have food

2
00:00:01.566 --> 00:00:04.066
But it wasn't illegal.

3
00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:05.500
Why make up for it?

4
00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:09.700
And I'm here today to demand justice

5
00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:12.133
Here's your chance.

6
00:00:12.133 --> 00:00:13.466
Since you are obsessed

7
00:00:13.533 --> 00:00:15.200
Don't blame me for being selfish in front of me

8
00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:19.133
It's ridiculous that you want my food

9
00:00:19.133 --> 00:00:22.733
Why beat around the bush and take what is selfless?

10
00:00:22.733 --> 00:00:23.533
bold

11
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.300
You even dare to contradict my brother

12
00:00:26.366 --> 00:00:28.200
I think you are not wronged if I kill you.

13
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.266
I think you should stop the ink

14
00:00:30.666 --> 00:00:34.900
Kill him and the food will still be our paradise

15
00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:36.333
There is a way, don't you go?

16
00:00:36.333 --> 00:00:37.300
Take it out

17
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:39.866
Hey, it's over, it's over.

18
00:00:39.866 --> 00:00:40.266
Xiao He

19
00:00:40.266 --> 00:00:42.566
Your employer is really going to be pulled out and beheaded

20
00:00:42.566 --> 00:00:44.500
Ouch, I told him not to go to the barracks in the morning

21
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.500
It's over, it's over, I don't have a boss now

22
00:00:50.366 --> 00:00:54.433
Prisoner Wutian sentenced to death for theft

23
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:55.633
execute immediately

24
00:00:56.366 --> 00:00:58.366
Diving order haha

25
00:00:59.066 --> 00:01:00.500
Hahahaha

26
00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.700
You can eat it, hahahaha.

27
00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:06.066
OK

28
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.066
Little baby my little cutie

29
00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:10.766
You should eat more!

30
00:01:10.766 --> 00:01:13.266
Can't starve you hahaha

31
00:01:13.333 --> 00:01:15.266
Let me kiss

32
00:01:17.066 --> 00:01:18.266
The mayor is bad

33
00:01:18.466 --> 00:01:20.800
What's the matter, don't panic

34
00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.300
I'm looking for you to sell hell

35
00:01:22.333 --> 00:01:23.466
I went to find Wu Tian

36
00:01:23.466 --> 00:01:25.100
Found that the other party is not in Qingshan Town

37
00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:26.333
Framed as a thief

38
00:01:26.333 --> 00:01:28.100
And brought people to the barracks

39
00:01:28.333 --> 00:01:30.200
Damn it

40
00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.533
You call the palace manager and let me take a look.

41
00:01:32.533 --> 00:01:35.566
Who dares to lift my brother's grandmother's
