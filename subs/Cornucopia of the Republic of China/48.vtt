00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:01.800
What are you guys doing?

2
00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:03.400
I'm not your Mayor Wu

3
00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:06.200
Mayor Wu, if you are not our teacher

4
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:08.566
Then we can only disband in place

5
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:09.633
You're right.

6
00:00:09.766 --> 00:00:11.300
Mayor Wu is at this time

7
00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:12.300
Don't push to death

8
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.500
Okay, since everyone is kind

9
00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:18.266
Then I will serve as a teacher for the time being

10
00:00:19.266 --> 00:00:20.666
Xiaohe fan

11
00:00:20.766 --> 00:00:23.466
Officers who are willing to stay will be sent each month

12
00:00:23.533 --> 00:00:24.600
200 oceans

13
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.200
Don't want to stay?

14
00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:27.800
We have to pay

15
00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.366
Who stopped the money and still wants to leave?

16
00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.533
After I got sick, he

17
00:00:31.533 --> 00:00:33.400
So I went with nothing.

18
00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:34.666
I can't even win

19
00:00:35.333 --> 00:00:37.766
You're right, whoever dares to go

20
00:00:37.766 --> 00:00:39.066
I can't let him go

21
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:40.766
Long live the long life

22
00:00:42.266 --> 00:00:43.066
Long live

23
00:00:44.333 --> 00:00:45.133
Brothers

24
00:00:45.133 --> 00:00:46.500
Now that I am in this world

25
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.066
You have to avenge the brother of death

26
00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.000
You have to find a future for your brothers

27
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.500
So I have a couple of things to announce today.

28
00:00:53.466 --> 00:00:56.000
Division Commander Zhang Deshuo's troops have launched an attack

29
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
What division just died

30
00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.500
This bastard is restless again

31
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:01.400
Teacher, let me go alone

32
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:02.266
Come to my teacher

33
00:01:02.266 --> 00:01:03.566
I want to avenge Master Huang

34
00:01:03.566 --> 00:01:05.600
Wait, the enemy is fierce

35
00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:06.700
Don't be arrogant

36
00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:07.766
Forgive the order

37
00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:09.166
Give them a firefight

38
00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.566
Gave me a hard time to rebel against your weapons

39
00:01:11.566 --> 00:01:13.200
I have no other secrets to war

40
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.766
Only eight words are fully resourced

41
00:01:16.266 --> 00:01:18.466
Plenty of firepower yes
