00:00:03.666 --> 00:00:04.466
old man

2
00:00:06.066 --> 00:00:07.366
My girlfriend is in a hurry for money

3
00:00:07.366 --> 00:00:08.833
Please give me back the 500 yuan

4
00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:12.266
Catch something big, next time, next time?

5
00:00:12.466 --> 00:00:14.500
Take the new one that just came out.

6
00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:16.966
I said why do you always

7
00:00:22.666 --> 00:00:24.166
Every time

8
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.200
Stupid thing, do you know how expensive my car is?

9
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.700
You can't afford to sell your mother

10
00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:47.333
Dongdong

11
00:00:47.333 --> 00:00:50.333
Obviously you hit it first, it's you who should apologize

12
00:00:50.333 --> 00:00:53.433
I delivered takeout, and you dare to talk back

13
00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:54.966
What should I do?

14
00:00:58.166 --> 00:00:59.066
Baby

15
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:02.800
You really told me to let you drive well

16
00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.900
Can't we talk about this at the hotel?

17
00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:06.900
Lily, what are you doing here?

18
00:01:07.133 --> 00:01:10.466
Didn't you say you knew you went begging? Wu Tian, you

19
00:01:13.366 --> 00:01:14.633
Where do you care where I go?

20
00:01:14.866 --> 00:01:16.266
What does it have to do with you?

21
00:01:16.266 --> 00:01:17.966
Is this your boyfriend?

22
00:01:17.966 --> 00:01:18.866
Thanks bro

23
00:01:18.866 --> 00:01:21.700
Give me such a beautiful girlfriend to play with

24
00:01:24.666 --> 00:01:27.466
Lili, why did you betray me, Wu Tian?

25
00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:29.766
You didn't even hold my hand

26
00:01:29.766 --> 00:01:32.266
How can this be considered betrayal? I advise you?

27
00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.900
Or hurry up and kneel down and kowtow to Zhang Shao and apologize

28
00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:37.933
He's someone you can't afford to offend

29
00:01:37.933 --> 00:01:39.700
Are you unconvinced?

30
00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:41.833
What can you do if you are not convinced?

31
00:01:42.333 --> 00:01:44.600
A low-level reptile like you

32
00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.066
Deserving the green grassland

33
00:01:46.066 --> 00:01:47.800
Then kneel before me

34
00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:49.900
Be a dog that begs for mercy

35
00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:54.966
I kill you I kill you

36
00:01:55.533 --> 00:01:58.366
Stop it, you lunatic

37
00:02:01.066 --> 00:02:02.666
You still help him

38
00:02:05.466 --> 00:02:08.066
I want your life today

39
00:02:21.933 --> 00:02:23.600
See Jaguar Galaxy Lord

40
00:02:24.566 --> 00:02:27.200
Master, you have been traveling abroad for many years

41
00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:28.366
Please come back.

42
00:02:28.366 --> 00:02:31.266
Welcome back to join us

43
00:02:35.166 --> 00:02:36.500
Trimble family

44
00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:38.600
It was from the Republic of China

45
00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.266
It can be a big factory that is rich enough to rival the country

46
00:02:41.366 --> 00:02:43.366
Didn't you say he was a delivery man?

47
00:02:43.766 --> 00:02:44.800
I don't know.

48
00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.600
Big baby, you're killing me

49
00:02:48.466 --> 00:02:50.900
Don't kneel down and apologize to Qian Bao's family. I

50
00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.866
I was wrong, please forgive me.

51
00:02:54.333 --> 00:02:57.833
I turned out to be the patriarch of the Qianbao family

52
00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.766
Here's hahaha

53
00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:02.566
I didn't expect it.

54
00:03:02.566 --> 00:03:06.300
I've been hiding for so long and still let you pull

55
00:03:06.933 --> 00:03:09.000
I'm going back today, old man

56
00:03:09.066 --> 00:03:11.966
I didn't expect you to be the family of the legendary Tianbao

57
00:03:12.933 --> 00:03:16.666
You, you made me suffer so badly, go and be presumptuous

58
00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:18.533
How dare you be rude to grandpa

59
00:03:18.533 --> 00:03:20.366
Don't worry, lad.

60
00:03:20.366 --> 00:03:21.966
I won't owe you anything

61
00:03:21.966 --> 00:03:22.666
Do you see it?

62
00:03:22.666 --> 00:03:25.333
These treasures on the book stand are all paid off for you

63
00:03:25.333 --> 00:03:26.500
There will be a period later.

64
00:03:26.566 --> 00:03:27.766
White dry white

65
00:03:28.066 --> 00:03:29.633
Hey.

66
00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:31.100
old man

67
00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.566
It turns out that you are not a subordinate of the Heavenly King.

68
00:03:38.133 --> 00:03:40.666
Kid, I will kill you today

69
00:03:40.666 --> 00:03:43.766
Whoever is afraid of you is a coward

70
00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:47.966
Uh-huh.

71
00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:50.266
Stop hitting.

72
00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:52.833
Don't fight, don't fight

73
00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.866
Stop it, stop it

74
00:03:56.733 --> 00:03:57.533
Ah!

75
00:04:04.533 --> 00:04:06.366
Zhang Shao, are you alright?

76
00:04:07.166 --> 00:04:07.966
he

77
00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:09.633
Is he dead?

78
00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:11.366
Yes!

79
00:04:11.966 --> 00:04:12.766
OK

80
00:04:13.766 --> 00:04:15.866
Okay, okay. Okay.
