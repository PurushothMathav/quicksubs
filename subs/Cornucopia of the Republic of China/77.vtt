00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:03.000
Mr. Second, how do you apologize to him?

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.166
Yeah, he just offended you

3
00:00:06.166 --> 00:00:07.466
You listen carefully

4
00:00:07.466 --> 00:00:09.900
My factory has been sold to Mr. Wu

5
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.000
He's my boss now.

6
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.233
Including the weapons you sell

7
00:00:13.266 --> 00:00:15.600
If you haven't heard of Mr. Wu

8
00:00:16.266 --> 00:00:18.266
None of you are going to get a weapon

9
00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:19.300
That's impossible.

10
00:00:20.266 --> 00:00:23.066
Mr. Ma, you must be lying to us.

11
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.733
Confess to me right now

12
00:00:26.733 --> 00:00:27.800
Apologize

13
00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.866
Otherwise, I will cancel this order immediately.

14
00:00:31.866 --> 00:00:32.866
Homeless

15
00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:34.566
No no no no strength

16
00:00:35.166 --> 00:00:36.433
It's all my fault

17
00:00:36.466 --> 00:00:38.533
But you can't blame me.

18
00:00:38.533 --> 00:00:40.066
It's all Zhang Deshuai

19
00:00:40.066 --> 00:00:42.233
He lied to me about the samurai order

20
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:43.966
I serve as your officer

21
00:00:44.066 --> 00:00:46.100
I follow your command

22
00:00:47.333 --> 00:00:50.200
You two traitors are shameless

23
00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:52.500
Wu

24
00:00:53.566 --> 00:00:56.466
Wussell, let me explain

25
00:00:56.733 --> 00:00:57.533
Zhang Deshun

26
00:00:58.366 --> 00:00:59.300
Our battle

27
00:00:59.533 --> 00:01:00.666
Be slow in the future

28
00:01:00.966 --> 00:01:02.566
I won't embarrass you today.

29
00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:04.466
See you on the battlefield someday

30
00:01:05.566 --> 00:01:07.000
I will marry you happily

31
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.133
There you go.

32
00:01:09.133 --> 00:01:13.366
Thank you, thank you, Samurai Lin, go, go

33
00:01:15.466 --> 00:01:18.800
Brother Wu didn't want to help you hide so deep

34
00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.300
Hahaha, I admire it.

35
00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:24.733
Brother, I just received a little money

36
00:01:24.733 --> 00:01:27.100
This happened to buy another palace in the West

37
00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:28.400
Compared to you, big brother

38
00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:29.800
What am I worth?

39
00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.700
Brother Wu, I was wrong

40
00:01:32.766 --> 00:01:35.000
Come on, change the commander's clothes

41
00:01:35.333 --> 00:01:37.800
You are now a well-deserved commander

42
00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.800
Hahahaha
