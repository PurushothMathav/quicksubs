00:00:01.733 --> 00:00:03.000
Uncle Tang?

2
00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:07.166
Ah, the brigade commander ordered

3
00:00:07.266 --> 00:00:08.366
Clean up the yard

4
00:00:08.366 --> 00:00:09.966
Send me all the business

5
00:00:11.366 --> 00:00:12.166
How come?

6
00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:13.500
You are the owner of this house

7
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:14.733
I have already collected your yard.

8
00:00:14.733 --> 00:00:15.566
Ask them to leave.

9
00:00:15.566 --> 00:00:17.200
I said what happened to these wounded

10
00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:18.566
Why not right away?

11
00:00:18.566 --> 00:00:19.733
Do you think I don't want to save you?

12
00:00:19.733 --> 00:00:21.000
Things are so scarce right now

13
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.100
These are reserved for the rescue officers

14
00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:24.600
They can't save it for now

15
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:25.866
They're people, too.

16
00:00:25.866 --> 00:00:27.100
They must be treated immediately

17
00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:28.700
Do you think you are the savior?

18
00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:30.600
Sure, you give me 10 boxes of gauze

19
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:31.666
10 boxes of anesthesia to go

20
00:00:31.666 --> 00:00:32.966
I will start the surgery now

21
00:00:32.966 --> 00:00:34.000
Wait for me.

22
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.633
I'll send it back to you right away

23
00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.800
Wait a minute, these are all brocade sheaths

24
00:00:38.866 --> 00:00:40.600
Even if you collect death

25
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:41.766
Get these things back

26
00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:43.333
Why are you talking big?

27
00:00:43.333 --> 00:00:44.733
Since I said so

28
00:00:44.733 --> 00:00:45.966
It means I have the confidence

29
00:00:45.966 --> 00:00:47.966
So you take the medicine you go to

30
00:00:47.966 --> 00:00:49.000
Give me a piece of each

31
00:00:49.166 --> 00:00:51.033
I will arrange for someone to deliver it to you immediately.

32
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.300
You have to have this in your hands

33
00:00:53.333 --> 00:00:54.433
I told your grandfather to leave

34
00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:00.800
These things have to be returned.

35
00:01:01.366 --> 00:01:02.300
Arrange for them immediately

36
00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.400
Say 5 words and it will be there soon.

37
00:01:06.333 --> 00:01:08.266
Sir, he can really get these things

38
00:01:08.266 --> 00:01:09.800
Are you out of your mind too?

39
00:01:10.366 --> 00:01:12.233
These are all prohibited military substances

40
00:01:12.533 --> 00:01:15.000
The grand marshal issued the ban

41
00:01:15.066 --> 00:01:16.200
They can get it.

42
00:01:16.266 --> 00:01:17.300
Then you let him do it?

43
00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.133
Look at this kid is also quite rich

44
00:01:19.133 --> 00:01:20.933
Wait a minute, he can't get anything out.

45
00:01:20.933 --> 00:01:22.966
We took it down and begged him
