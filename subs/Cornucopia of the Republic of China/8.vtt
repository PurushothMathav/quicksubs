00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:02.400
Guest officer, how many years have these three oceans proved?

2
00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:04.266
Now the water is monopolized by the Li family

3
00:00:04.266 --> 00:00:06.333
And the eldest young master of the Li family, the head of the county residents

4
00:00:06.333 --> 00:00:08.533
How many people can't buy water now?

5
00:00:08.533 --> 00:00:10.100
This glass of water

6
00:00:10.466 --> 00:00:11.533
Three oceans

7
00:00:11.533 --> 00:00:13.366
What if I deliver food?

8
00:00:13.366 --> 00:00:14.433
Isn't that

9
00:00:15.666 --> 00:00:18.233
Uh, no, you have to change your thinking

10
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.000
Anyone?

11
00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:24.766
If you go to sell water

12
00:00:24.766 --> 00:00:27.033
Xiao Er, can you bring me another glass of water?

13
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.000
Xiao He went to find a few buckets to fetch water

14
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.500
What are you going to sell on the street with me?

15
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.333
I don't know how many years this well has been dry

16
00:00:57.333 --> 00:00:58.866
Where is the water?

17
00:00:59.733 --> 00:01:00.533
Wow

18
00:01:01.066 --> 00:01:02.766
This crystal is full

19
00:01:02.766 --> 00:01:04.733
Heck, all this fuss

20
00:01:04.733 --> 00:01:05.600
Get to work

21
00:01:05.733 --> 00:01:07.666
Yes yes yes I will go now

22
00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.700
Please exchange my daughter for a bucket of water

23
00:01:23.766 --> 00:01:25.033
She looks good.

24
00:01:25.166 --> 00:01:26.766
Barely change the way

25
00:01:31.966 --> 00:01:32.800
Hey

26
00:01:38.266 --> 00:01:40.433
See the four oceans?

27
00:01:41.466 --> 00:01:42.500
Why did the price increase again?

28
00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.966
There's justice to that.

29
00:01:44.966 --> 00:01:47.666
No money, no money, get out of here

30
00:01:47.766 --> 00:01:49.366
Let me go, second young master

31
00:01:49.733 --> 00:01:50.933
Second young master, please

32
00:01:50.933 --> 00:01:51.966
Let Xiaoping go

33
00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:54.166
His father is sick and needs his care

34
00:01:54.166 --> 00:01:56.300
His father took a bucket of water from me

35
00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.900
He has to take care of me at night

36
00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:00.200
Why should I let him go?

37
00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.866
Or do you want to take him with you?

38
00:02:03.066 --> 00:02:04.633
Come on, sir
