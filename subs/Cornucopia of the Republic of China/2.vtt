What's wrong with you, daughter, what's wrong with you every day?

Just one bite.

10
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.266
Old old

11
00:00:34.933 --> 00:00:36.466
That's not appetizing either

12
00:00:36.466 --> 00:00:40.366
Well, accompany me to have a good time, hahaha.

13
00:00:47.166 --> 00:00:47.966
OK

14
00:00:48.733 --> 00:00:52.000

Hahaha, why should I die?

19
00:00:57.933 --> 00:01:01.400
Don't come here before you starve to death

Ah!

22
00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:13.766
Grandpa, it hasn't rained in a long time.

23
00:01:13.766 --> 00:01:15.666
Godmother wants to sell me to the second young master

24
00:01:15.666 --> 00:01:17.466
I don't want to marry that villain

25
00:01:17.466 --> 00:01:20.366
Can you help me if you add another 0?

26
00:01:26.166 --> 00:01:28.400
Grandpa, you really appeared

27
00:01:36.466 --> 00:01:37.566

Where am I?

32
00:01:52.066 --> 00:01:54.133
Is this Qingshan Town?

33
00:01:54.133 --> 00:01:55.733
Qingshan Town

34
00:01:55.733 --> 00:01:57.233
Why am I here?

35
00:01:58.666 --> 00:01:59.766
What day is today?

36
00:01:59.766 --> 00:02:02.866
Today is July 15, the 21st of the Republic of China

37
00:02:02.866 --> 00:02:04.766
Brother, are you alright?

How do you eat this?

42
00:02:18.866 --> 00:02:22.700
This big brother has been in drought for a year

43
00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.366
It would be nice to have something to eat

44
00:02:26.366 --> 00:02:27.800
A year of drought

45
00:02:28.933 --> 00:02:30.266
According to history

46
00:02:30.266 --> 00:02:32.966
It's just that the drought will last a long time to explain

47
00:02:33.533 --> 00:02:34.333
i

48
00:02:37.166 --> 00:02:38.500
I'm finished.

49
00:02:39.533 --> 00:02:41.133
I didn't look at you for a while

50
00:02:41.133 --> 00:02:43.666
You little hoof is here for a man

51
00:02:43.966 --> 00:02:45.500
Go home now

52
00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:51.233
Godmother, he is injured and needs someone to take care of him

53
00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.866
Why do you still want to keep him?

54
00:02:53.866 --> 00:02:55.333
Don't think I don't know

55
00:02:55.333 --> 00:02:58.366
Once your body is broken, it will be worthless. Come back with me.

56
00:02:58.766 --> 00:03:00.633
Go back godmother go back

57
00:03:17.866 --> 00:03:19.600
It starts with a chamber pot.

58
00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:21.100
How does this play?

59
00:03:27.566 --> 00:03:29.366
What the hell is this?

60
00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.400
How can you eat this?
