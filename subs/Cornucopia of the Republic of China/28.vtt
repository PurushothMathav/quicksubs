00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.666
Dude, this is no joke.

2
00:00:02.666 --> 00:00:04.666
Are you sure you can take it out?

3
00:00:04.666 --> 00:00:06.366
Of course big brother

4
00:00:06.466 --> 00:00:07.866
Give me half an hour.

5
00:00:07.966 --> 00:00:09.666
I'll have someone bring it to you right away

6
00:00:09.666 --> 00:00:10.466
nonsense

7
00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:12.833
You are a critic, how could you possibly get ammunition?

8
00:00:13.366 --> 00:00:14.866
If you can't help, forget it.

9
00:00:14.866 --> 00:00:16.666
Still talking nonsense here

10
00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.366
This is a big fool who has everyone's name on it

11
00:00:20.533 --> 00:00:22.400
How dare you mess around here

12
00:00:22.533 --> 00:00:23.600
Even if it could

13
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:24.733
Just half an hour

14
00:00:24.733 --> 00:00:25.933
How many big drugs can you get?

15
00:00:25.933 --> 00:00:27.400
There's no way to turn the tide of the war

16
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.366
Mayor or not

17
00:00:29.666 --> 00:00:31.366
What are we doing?

18
00:00:31.366 --> 00:00:33.100
Never a servant in history

19
00:00:34.366 --> 00:00:35.233
brother

20
00:00:35.566 --> 00:00:38.533
Are you sure you can get enough bile oil out?

21
00:00:38.533 --> 00:00:42.600
Brother, what I say will definitely be done well

22
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.000
Wang Fugui

23
00:00:44.533 --> 00:00:46.733
Show my brother our stuff

24
00:00:46.733 --> 00:00:48.066
Teacher can't do it?

25
00:00:48.066 --> 00:00:50.500
Don't be deceived by this kid!

26
00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.700
Get the whole army's ammunition in half an hour

27
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.166
How is that possible?

28
00:00:55.166 --> 00:00:56.400
This kid

29
00:00:56.533 --> 00:00:58.000
Must want to kill everyone

30
00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.766
What are you?

31
00:00:59.766 --> 00:01:01.000
Don't let me hurt you

32
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.666
Lao Tzu is called the brigade commander

33
00:01:02.933 --> 00:01:04.366
You're a jerk

34
00:01:04.366 --> 00:01:07.066
How dare you contradict me?

35
00:01:07.333 --> 00:01:09.166
I'll get back to you now.

36
00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.600
It is the rape punishment sent by Zhang Deshuai

37
00:01:11.866 --> 00:01:14.400
Zhang Deshuai and Li Jiarao are vulgar to me

38
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.600
How could I have waited for them here?

39
00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:18.300
I count you as a nerve

40
00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:19.800
You're the girl.

41
00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:21.866
He's my brother.

42
00:01:21.866 --> 00:01:23.033
Come on this trip

43
00:01:23.566 --> 00:01:25.866
Ask Adi to compare to the Dharmaraja

44
00:01:26.066 --> 00:01:28.866
Commander, even if this kid has ammunition?

45
00:01:28.866 --> 00:01:31.033
If his ammo doesn't meet specifications

46
00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:32.366
When were we?

47
00:01:32.366 --> 00:01:34.300
Not even a chance to surrender

48
00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:35.633
What the second captain said makes sense.

49
00:01:35.733 --> 00:01:38.100
Now the lives of the whole army are on that kid

50
00:01:38.366 --> 00:01:39.433
Go and see

51
00:01:39.566 --> 00:01:40.600
Can't let him get everyone killed

52
00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.566
Big brother wait for me
