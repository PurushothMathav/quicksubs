00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:01.666
Hahaha

2
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:04.100
Ah!

3
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.233
The groom came

4
00:00:09.266 --> 00:00:10.800
Oh, Mr. Hu

5
00:00:10.866 --> 00:00:13.133
You are a living Buddha

6
00:00:13.133 --> 00:00:15.066
Is it right?

7
00:00:16.166 --> 00:00:17.000
Get away from me

8
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.333
Your water is not for sale.

9
00:00:18.333 --> 00:00:19.800
Why don't you let us get water?

10
00:00:19.866 --> 00:00:21.200
You are too domineering

11
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.300
Yeah, so domineering, oh my god

12
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.966
Police card, you are suspected of stealing something from your house

13
00:00:25.966 --> 00:00:27.533
Now people are dirty

14
00:00:27.533 --> 00:00:29.300
See what kind of explanation you give me.

15
00:00:29.733 --> 00:00:30.900
How is that possible?

16
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.866
These are dowry gifts for my daughter

17
00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:34.433
How could it be stolen?

18
00:00:34.466 --> 00:00:37.600
Only I, the Li family, have the master of this entire Qingshan Town

19
00:00:38.566 --> 00:00:39.466
If you hadn't stolen it

20
00:00:39.466 --> 00:00:41.700
Where does my water come from?

21
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.466
These are my own things

22
00:00:43.466 --> 00:00:45.266
And I've never stolen anything.

23
00:00:45.266 --> 00:00:47.066
Since you think I'm stealing

24
00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.200
Please show me the evidence.

25
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.333
You obviously stole from my house

26
00:00:51.333 --> 00:00:53.433
How dare you quibble, stop talking nonsense

27
00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:54.200
Take him away

28
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:55.600
Supreme pick up

29
00:00:57.166 --> 00:00:58.700
You can't arrest Brother Wu

30
00:00:58.966 --> 00:01:01.266
Brother Wu definitely didn't steal anything, I can prove it.

31
00:01:01.333 --> 00:01:02.366
Prove my shit

32
00:01:02.366 --> 00:01:04.933
Go away and take the water away from me

33
00:01:04.933 --> 00:01:06.900
He sent us this water.

34
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:07.766
Why do you take it away

35
00:01:07.766 --> 00:01:08.666
This is not allowed to be taken away

36
00:01:08.666 --> 00:01:10.300
No one can take this water away

37
00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:11.633
Let go of my boss

38
00:01:11.933 --> 00:01:12.766
Are you going to rebel?

39
00:01:12.766 --> 00:01:13.900
Get out of the way

40
00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:14.900
attack day

41
00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:16.300
You're taking a big gamble with guns

42
00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:17.500
Is there any king's law?

43
00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.700
Wang Fa Laozi Li Jiahao is Wang Fa

44
00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.833
Anyone who dares to stand in the way will be beaten to death
