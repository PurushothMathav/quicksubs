00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:01.500
Then I'll go. Okay?

2
00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:03.466
I'll send it to you, hahaha Mayor Wu.

3
00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:06.366
From now on, your business is mine

4
00:00:06.366 --> 00:00:08.566
Don't worry, after I go back.

5
00:00:08.566 --> 00:00:10.033
Sure to help you look good

6
00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:11.533
Just wait for the promotion and get rich

7
00:00:11.533 --> 00:00:13.966
Then I thank my brother

8
00:00:14.533 --> 00:00:15.333
bloom

9
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.866
Sir, I just found this suspicious

10
00:00:18.866 --> 00:00:20.000
Let's check it out again.

11
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.266
Where did the doubt come from?

12
00:00:22.266 --> 00:00:23.166
Hey, Li Jiaren

13
00:00:23.333 --> 00:00:24.533
Don't fiddle with right and wrong

14
00:00:24.533 --> 00:00:25.900
Be careful I know your sin

15
00:00:25.933 --> 00:00:28.366
Sir, I also received the order

16
00:00:28.366 --> 00:00:29.700
Right to investigate

17
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:30.500
Li Jiaren

18
00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:32.766
The investigation has been completed here.

19
00:00:32.766 --> 00:00:34.300
There is no doubt.

20
00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.500
But your previous defection didn't quite fit the true process

21
00:00:38.766 --> 00:00:42.100
Mayor Wu, I'll leave it to you to check

22
00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:43.100
Don't worry sir

23
00:00:43.166 --> 00:00:45.166
I will handle the case impartially

24
00:00:45.166 --> 00:00:47.400
Give the above a perfect explanation

25
00:00:47.933 --> 00:00:51.266
Someone is frightened by me, his weapon, watch over you.

26
00:00:52.766 --> 00:00:54.933
Sir, just say something for me

27
00:00:54.933 --> 00:00:57.466
Brother Wu, it's getting late

28
00:00:57.466 --> 00:00:59.066
Then I'll say goodbye

29
00:00:59.066 --> 00:01:00.000
Sir, walk slowly

30
00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:01.600
Sir sir

31
00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.100
Don't leave me alone, sir

32
00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.200
Chairperson, I was wrong.

33
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.300
I was also forced

34
00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:09.333
You are amazing

35
00:01:09.333 --> 00:01:11.300
Forgive me, forgive you

36
00:01:12.933 --> 00:01:14.833
Those who died because of you

37
00:01:15.066 --> 00:01:16.633
Can they come back to life?

38
00:01:16.666 --> 00:01:18.000
Since it cannot be resurrected

39
00:01:18.866 --> 00:01:20.266
Then you go down

40
00:01:20.766 --> 00:01:21.633
Take it out

41
00:01:21.733 --> 00:01:23.866
The samurai hit you, give me another chance

42
00:01:25.166 --> 00:01:27.266
Excuse me, Mr. Mayor. He's about to let go.

43
00:01:27.266 --> 00:01:28.066
You need to meet him.
