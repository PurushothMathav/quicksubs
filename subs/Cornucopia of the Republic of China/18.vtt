00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:01.566
Do you hear me?

2
00:00:01.566 --> 00:00:02.900
This is what happens to you.

3
00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:05.166
Even a pariah dares to fight with me

4
00:00:05.366 --> 00:00:06.733
Don't be too happy

5
00:00:06.733 --> 00:00:07.733
I tell you the truth

6
00:00:07.733 --> 00:00:10.066
Master Huang and I are sworn brothers

7
00:00:10.066 --> 00:00:12.366
If he knew about it today

8
00:00:12.466 --> 00:00:14.366
All have to die

9
00:00:14.533 --> 00:00:18.633
You are also delusional about having a relationship with Master Huang

10
00:00:18.733 --> 00:00:20.033
I'll tell you what.

11
00:00:20.133 --> 00:00:21.800
Even our Li family

12
00:00:22.066 --> 00:00:24.300
It is also rare to see Mayor Huang

13
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.800
He is the mayor Xie Duhuang, and the crime is added to the class

14
00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.133
Who is Mayor Huang?

15
00:00:28.133 --> 00:00:30.333
How could he know us ordinary people

16
00:00:30.333 --> 00:00:33.133
I think you were scared silly before you died

17
00:00:33.133 --> 00:00:34.900
I have no reason to deceive you

18
00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:37.666
If I die here today, stay with me

19
00:00:37.666 --> 00:00:39.800
This is still in Wei Yansuo

20
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:41.966
Why didn't I see it?

21
00:00:41.966 --> 00:00:44.100
Can you be Master Huang's brother?

22
00:00:44.966 --> 00:00:48.000
Why should I kneel down and kowtow for you now?

23
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:48.800
Humph

24
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.100
That's pretty good.

25
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.766
If you kneel down and apologize to me now, I'll listen

26
00:00:52.766 --> 00:00:55.433
I'll ask you for money later.

27
00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.600
If you spare his mother, you will shine with some sunshine.

28
00:00:58.866 --> 00:01:01.300
Master Huang, Wei Gaoquan can get to know you

29
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.633
You pariah except for stealing

30
00:01:03.866 --> 00:01:06.200
It's a set of lies

31
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:07.466
All right.

32
00:01:07.666 --> 00:01:10.900
Find out before clinging to the relationship in the next life

33
00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:12.966
You're going to say you're the mayor's brother

34
00:01:12.966 --> 00:01:14.700
I still believe a few points

35
00:01:14.733 --> 00:01:16.966
You said you were Mayor Huang's brother

36
00:01:17.266 --> 00:01:19.200
This is nonsense.

37
00:01:19.333 --> 00:01:21.166
Is it nonsense?

38
00:01:21.533 --> 00:01:23.066
Come on and you'll know.

39
00:01:23.066 --> 00:01:24.966
You are scared

40
00:01:24.966 --> 00:01:26.666
I'll kill you today.

41
00:01:26.666 --> 00:01:28.900
I'd like to see how Ben is doing

42
00:01:29.266 --> 00:01:31.566
What are you still doing?

43
00:01:34.166 --> 00:01:38.066
Suffer death, hide away when you see this young master in your next life

44
00:01:38.366 --> 00:01:40.466
Hahahahaha

45
00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.100
Don't marry

46
00:01:50.066 --> 00:01:52.033
Haha, the king has arrived
