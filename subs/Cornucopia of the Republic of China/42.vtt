00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.000
Hey

2
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:10.366
Hey daughter-in-law sit

3
00:00:11.133 --> 00:00:13.466
The hot tea just made by the master and the young lady

4
00:00:13.466 --> 00:00:14.766
I hired the Li family today

5
00:00:14.766 --> 00:00:15.966
You can't just drink tea

6
00:00:15.966 --> 00:00:18.900
Go to the winery and get some wine to celebrate

7
00:00:19.966 --> 00:00:22.633
I'm sorry sir and young grandma, I don't want to clean up

8
00:00:24.066 --> 00:00:25.700
How could the second young master be arrested?

9
00:00:26.166 --> 00:00:27.866
If the second young master dies

10
00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:30.066
Homeless people have to be buried with me

11
00:00:32.733 --> 00:00:36.666
My daughter-in-law asked me to wait well tonight

12
00:00:39.266 --> 00:00:40.666
Master Mao, wait a minute

13
00:00:40.666 --> 00:00:43.300
Today I look at soldiers who are fighting

14
00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:44.966
Hungry gnawing on bark grass roots

15
00:00:44.966 --> 00:00:46.266
Poor

16
00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:51.266
Why don't we distribute the food a little bit?

17
00:00:51.533 --> 00:00:52.633
It's up to you.

18
00:01:00.566 --> 00:01:01.666
Hahahaha

19
00:01:01.666 --> 00:01:04.333
Dude, you can afford meat buns

20
00:01:04.333 --> 00:01:06.366
Brother, I'm really convinced

21
00:01:06.366 --> 00:01:07.966
These brothers have worked hard at war

22
00:01:07.966 --> 00:01:09.433
A little food is nothing

23
00:01:09.566 --> 00:01:10.800
Hahahaha

24
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:11.600
Brother

25
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.600
Brother, I don't know how to thank you

26
00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:14.633
But don't worry.

27
00:01:14.966 --> 00:01:17.200
Handsome, won't last two days

28
00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:18.366
Back to the vehicle immediately

29
00:01:18.933 --> 00:01:20.966
Because his vehicle number is finished.

30
00:01:20.966 --> 00:01:22.300
Hahahaha

31
00:01:25.366 --> 00:01:26.933
What the hell is going on?

32
00:01:26.933 --> 00:01:28.466
Was the enemy attacking?

33
00:01:30.333 --> 00:01:32.933
Ah, the second brother made him betray the dog

34
00:01:32.933 --> 00:01:35.466
And blew up all our food

35
00:01:36.133 --> 00:01:39.700
I can't spare him, this bastard

36
00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.000
Kill me out

37
00:01:43.733 --> 00:01:44.533
No.

38
00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:46.100
Something is wrong

39
00:01:46.333 --> 00:01:47.666
If the other party defected

40
00:01:47.666 --> 00:01:49.166
Must have been prepared

41
00:01:49.166 --> 00:01:51.666
If the royal family dies without medicine, it's all over

42
00:01:52.566 --> 00:01:55.300
No, I'll think of a way.

43
00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:57.700
Okay
