00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:01.266
Don't talk nonsense.

2
00:00:01.266 --> 00:00:03.300
Who stole from your house and still doesn't admit it?

3
00:00:03.333 --> 00:00:04.966
Hey folks

4
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.333
Come on, folks!

5
00:00:06.333 --> 00:00:07.566
Come and have a look.

6
00:00:07.566 --> 00:00:10.466
This kid not only wants to lie to my girl

7
00:00:10.466 --> 00:00:12.066
Steal my food

8
00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.600
This is my house.

9
00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:16.333
Your daughter gave it to me

10
00:00:16.333 --> 00:00:17.666
It has nothing to do with the same

11
00:00:17.666 --> 00:00:18.766
Don't worry, just come.

12
00:00:18.766 --> 00:00:22.366
Who doesn't know the value of food these days?

13
00:00:22.366 --> 00:00:24.066
My daughter will give it to you.

14
00:00:24.066 --> 00:00:26.133
You don't pee. Take a picture of yourself

15
00:00:26.133 --> 00:00:27.400
What is it?

16
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:28.466
good boy

17
00:00:28.466 --> 00:00:30.466
I said how do you send them these things?

18
00:00:30.466 --> 00:00:31.700
It was stolen

19
00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:33.366
I usually hate thieves the most

20
00:00:33.366 --> 00:00:35.766
Let's take down this knife thief together

21
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:36.800
Slow down. Slow down.

22
00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.300
There must be some misunderstanding.

23
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:39.166
Oh, fierce!

24
00:00:39.166 --> 00:00:40.533
Isn't it just a wowotou?

25
00:00:40.533 --> 00:00:41.966
Your daughter gave me one.

26
00:00:41.966 --> 00:00:43.533
I'll give you ten wowotou today.

27
00:00:43.533 --> 00:00:47.333
I bet if you can take out ten wowotou

28
00:00:47.333 --> 00:00:49.600
Write the old lady's name upside down

29
00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.666
OK, I'll give it to you.

30
00:00:52.666 --> 00:00:55.200
No, it's my hair, I'll give it to you.

31
00:00:55.366 --> 00:00:56.833
Is it enough for you?

32
00:00:56.866 --> 00:00:58.400
Where did you get so many wotou?

33
00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:59.800
Don't worry about this.

34
00:01:00.066 --> 00:01:02.233
Now I don't owe you food, do I?

35
00:01:02.666 --> 00:01:05.733
Hmph, isn't it just a few wowotou?

36
00:01:05.733 --> 00:01:06.766
I also tell you

37
00:01:06.766 --> 00:01:09.866
My Xiaoting can only marry someone like the second young master

38
00:01:09.866 --> 00:01:12.466
You, toad, want to eat swan meat

39
00:01:12.466 --> 00:01:13.266
No way.

40
00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.000
This big brother

41
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.300
You have so many woollies

42
00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:17.166
How about selling me two?

43
00:01:17.166 --> 00:01:21.100
I want I want I want I want I want I want to slow down no problem

44
00:01:21.133 --> 00:01:24.166
Come one by one, others sell two in one ocean.

45
00:01:24.166 --> 00:01:26.700
I sell one for 10 coppers today.

46
00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:27.900
Are you queuing up to buy?

47
00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.466
Okay, okay, one by one

48
00:01:32.533 --> 00:01:33.666

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.766
Thank you for this big brother's wowotou

51
00:01:38.766 --> 00:01:40.533
I, Hu Cuicui, can't repay

52
00:01:40.533 --> 00:01:42.833
If you don't mind

53
00:01:42.966 --> 00:01:45.633
Little girl, can I?

54
00:01:46.333 --> 00:01:47.300
good boy

55
00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:49.633
Do you have any idea how fresh the food is now?

56
00:01:49.666 --> 00:01:50.766
You sell 10 coppers first.

57
00:01:50.766 --> 00:01:52.266
Sell me two too

58
00:01:53.933 --> 00:01:54.766
Two eggs

59
00:01:55.733 --> 00:01:57.200
You sell others 10 copper coins.

60
00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:58.500
Sold me two oceans

61
00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:59.500
You wait for me.

62
00:02:00.933 --> 00:02:01.600
Keep it up. Keep it up.

63
00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:02.400
Everyone

64
00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:03.900
Shake it!

65
00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:05.133
Shake, shake, don't grab

66
00:02:05.133 --> 00:02:07.466
I can buy a pigsty after selling it for a while

67
00:02:09.266 --> 00:02:10.900
Don't move don't move

68
00:02:11.366 --> 00:02:12.600
No one is allowed to run
