00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.500
Big brother hahahaha

2
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.433
Hahahahaha

3
00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.433
Take these to my uncle

4
00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:20.066
Hahaha oops

5
00:00:20.066 --> 00:00:23.800
Brother, you can be regarded as helping brother beat his hair

6
00:00:23.866 --> 00:00:24.966
Yes, that's not right.

7
00:00:24.966 --> 00:00:27.400
How is this cannonball exactly the same as ours?

8
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:28.900
Lian Ding and are the same

9
00:00:30.066 --> 00:00:33.133
Wu, where did you get this cannonball?

10
00:00:33.133 --> 00:00:36.600
Do I need to explain to you where I'm from?

11
00:00:38.066 --> 00:00:41.233
Tell me why you have our ammo

12
00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:42.700
Are you blood?

13
00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.500
Sir, this is not really a number

14
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.366
Click stop

15
00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.100
Now the handsome troops are outside

16
00:00:50.266 --> 00:00:52.100
Is now the time for Uchito?

17
00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.966
Yes, this is the egg to be sent to the front

18
00:00:54.966 --> 00:00:56.333
You can't win then.

19
00:00:56.333 --> 00:00:57.700
Uncle is better than a cow

20
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.333
There is a hammer

21
00:01:00.333 --> 00:01:03.066
This kid dares to resell arms

22
00:01:03.466 --> 00:01:04.833
Help him slick off

23
00:01:04.966 --> 00:01:06.933
Catch him and he's handsome

24
00:01:06.933 --> 00:01:08.166
What are you talking about?

25
00:01:08.166 --> 00:01:09.200
My brother's medicine

26
00:01:09.533 --> 00:01:10.766
How many people have suffered?

27
00:01:11.266 --> 00:01:13.366
You, you, that includes you.

28
00:01:13.366 --> 00:01:15.400
How can you be ungrateful?

29
00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:16.200
division commander

30
00:01:16.566 --> 00:01:20.066
I say that for the brothers too

31
00:01:20.066 --> 00:01:22.300
Sir, I think it's a good idea

32
00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:24.200
Let the Wu family head take some money to fight the war

33
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.533
You have no trace

34
00:01:25.533 --> 00:01:27.000
Don't affect Tiankai

35
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.433
This is the situation now

36
00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:29.866
Get ready to fight

37
00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:34.833
Do you know this is crazy?

38
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.066
Isn't this taking everyone back to die?

39
00:01:38.533 --> 00:01:39.700
It should be

40
00:01:39.933 --> 00:01:41.166
No wonder anyone

41
00:01:49.966 --> 00:01:51.966
What are your chances of winning?

42
00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:55.500
Oh, this enemy is Yuko.

43
00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.733
I can only respect and listen to the previous one.

44
00:01:57.733 --> 00:01:58.700
I'm capable

45
00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.800
Fight them in a war of attrition. Fight them in a war of attrition.

46
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.666
That's not enough ammo to plug between your teeth

47
00:02:04.666 --> 00:02:05.900
I see this kid

48
00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:09.400
He was only happy when he hoped that everyone would die

49
00:02:09.566 --> 00:02:12.233
It's impossible if it's not enough.

50
00:02:12.866 --> 00:02:14.233
Are these enough?

51
00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.300
You fight them.

52
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.966
Oh, my God.

53
00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:25.200
So much.

54
00:02:25.866 --> 00:02:28.066
Am I dreaming?
