1
00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.466
My eldest brother, in order to protect the people of the town

2
00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:03.666
Hero Rescue

3
00:00:03.766 --> 00:00:05.000
Although I am not talented

4
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.700
But I also know how to kill people to pay off their lives and debts

5
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.066
I swear to God today

6
00:00:10.066 --> 00:00:12.033
I will definitely avenge my brother.

7
00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:15.966
Master Wu, if you can avenge the teacher

8
00:00:15.966 --> 00:00:17.466
I would like to respect you as my teacher

9
00:00:17.466 --> 00:00:18.933
I am a common man

10
00:00:18.933 --> 00:00:20.700
What qualifications do you have to be a teacher?

11
00:00:20.733 --> 00:00:21.700
But don't worry.

12
00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:23.900
As soon as there are supplies, I will definitely continue to supply them.

13
00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.100
I want to say that the mayor has pointed out that you should take over

14
00:00:26.133 --> 00:00:27.166
Don't touch porcelain

15
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.766
Wang Fugui, our grain must have been killed

16
00:00:29.766 --> 00:00:31.800
Does it make any difference who's on Big City Island?

17
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.666
It's just that the food is out of stock.

18
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.966
How to fight

19
00:00:36.133 --> 00:00:38.666
I think we can surrender

20
00:00:38.666 --> 00:00:40.000
The vengeance of the market

21
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:41.766
What do you mean by that?

22
00:00:41.766 --> 00:00:44.066
Hey, Adjutant Wang, what are you talking about?

23
00:00:44.066 --> 00:00:45.700
But what I said is true.

24
00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:48.033
Why do you still want to use the market to make me fail?

25
00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.700
The market is dying, do you want to break up?

26
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.966
Let me just say this for a second.

27
00:00:52.966 --> 00:00:55.200
Anyone who wants to leave or surrender

28
00:00:55.666 --> 00:00:58.066
Please help me, Wu will naturally not be cowardly.

29
00:00:58.333 --> 00:01:00.566
But today I put the words here

30
00:01:00.666 --> 00:01:02.466
We will meet on the battlefield someday

31
00:01:02.466 --> 00:01:05.800
It's no wonder you don't miss the old love

32
00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.033
Shut up, you just read half a sutra

33
00:01:08.133 --> 00:01:09.966
What right do you have to talk big here?

34
00:01:09.966 --> 00:01:12.300
Yes, even if you have two pieces of silver

35
00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:13.133
So what?

36
00:01:13.133 --> 00:01:14.833
Can you still beat Zhang Deshuai?

37
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.600
Although I can't beat Zhang Deshuai

38
00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:17.966
But I can bring out food.

39
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.666
Can solve everyone's current problems

40
00:01:19.666 --> 00:01:21.866
If you don't believe me, get out of here
