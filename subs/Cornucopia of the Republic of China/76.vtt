00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.133
Mr. Second

2
00:00:01.133 --> 00:00:01.900
Why are you here?

3
00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:03.200
I'm a businessperson.

4
00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:05.533
Where is the business going? Hahaha.

5
00:00:05.533 --> 00:00:06.666
Mr. Second

6
00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:09.566
Did you really sell the weapon to Wu Tian?

7
00:00:09.766 --> 00:00:11.400
I must warn you

8
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.133
This person has done something to ruin your reputation

9
00:00:14.133 --> 00:00:17.000
He not only found someone to impersonate you

10
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.266
And helped slander you

11
00:00:19.366 --> 00:00:21.833
We are all husbands, you

12
00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:23.766
Exposed him

13
00:00:23.766 --> 00:00:25.166
It's really a big bow and an arrow

14
00:00:25.166 --> 00:00:26.300
That's impossible.

15
00:00:26.366 --> 00:00:28.433
How could he be Mr. Second Brother?

16
00:00:28.466 --> 00:00:29.300
Oh buy kah

17
00:00:29.933 --> 00:00:32.566
I'm so stupid that you can't be confused.

18
00:00:32.566 --> 00:00:34.366
Mr. Na, don't worry.

19
00:00:34.466 --> 00:00:36.800
I'll ask him to apologize to you.

20
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:38.466
Wu Tian, are you guilty?

21
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:39.400
Wu Tian

22
00:00:40.066 --> 00:00:41.500
Raul himself is here

23
00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.233
Kneel down for 5 days

24
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.800
You can only atone by committing suicide now

25
00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.500
A mere Raul

26
00:00:49.766 --> 00:00:51.533
You are also qualified to accept my apology

27
00:00:51.533 --> 00:00:53.966
I'm going crazy

28
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.666
Do you know what you're talking about?

29
00:00:55.666 --> 00:00:57.166
Don't kneel down and apologize

30
00:00:57.366 --> 00:00:58.833
Is your death

31
00:00:58.866 --> 00:01:00.266
You are crazy

32
00:01:01.466 --> 00:01:03.400
This death is crazy

33
00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:05.533
Don't be angry, Mr. Second

34
00:01:05.533 --> 00:01:07.033
As long as the weapon is in hand

35
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.566
I'll help you break through the sky

36
00:01:11.866 --> 00:01:13.933
Damn it, don't shut up

37
00:01:13.933 --> 00:01:16.100
It seems that Mr. Lao Er has a noble status

38
00:01:16.166 --> 00:01:17.900
This insult is unacceptable

39
00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:19.100
Stop talking

40
00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:20.400
Let's get serious

41
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.200
subsidy

42
00:01:21.666 --> 00:01:24.633
Come on, I want to practice with you

43
00:01:25.866 --> 00:01:27.100
Stop it

44
00:01:28.266 --> 00:01:29.966
This damn thing

45
00:01:30.966 --> 00:01:31.866
Mr. Wei

46
00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:36.033
You, you got the wrong guy. Come down

47
00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:38.533
Venerable Wu Clan Master

48
00:01:38.533 --> 00:01:40.966
Please forgive these shameless
