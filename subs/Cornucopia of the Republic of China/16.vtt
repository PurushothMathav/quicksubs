00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:03.766
I am the younger brother of Captain Li

2
00:00:03.766 --> 00:00:05.600
Caught a thief stealing

3
00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:07.066
Send it to my brother for disposal.

4
00:00:07.066 --> 00:00:08.800
It turned out to be the younger brother of Captain Li

5
00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:09.833
Wait a minute.

6
00:00:09.966 --> 00:00:11.000
Let me know

7
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.666
Captain Li's brother is here

8
00:00:13.933 --> 00:00:14.733
Let's go

9
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.600
Who's coming outside?

10
00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:21.766
Commander, your brother came and caught a thief

11
00:00:21.766 --> 00:00:22.566
brother

12
00:00:23.066 --> 00:00:23.866
OK

13
00:00:25.166 --> 00:00:27.266
Okay bro

14
00:00:27.266 --> 00:00:28.933
We caught a thief.

15
00:00:28.933 --> 00:00:30.600
Stole our water and food

16
00:00:30.966 --> 00:00:32.266
Delivered to you to pet

17
00:00:32.266 --> 00:00:33.300
I didn't steal or rob

18
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.566
That stuff is all my own

19
00:00:34.566 --> 00:00:35.933
Don't mislead people

20
00:00:35.933 --> 00:00:38.366
Infinity Hidden Giant Fire

21
00:00:38.366 --> 00:00:39.400
I don't allow you to quibble

22
00:00:39.533 --> 00:00:42.900
Brother, what should I do with him?

23
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:44.100
Since we can find out

24
00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:45.100
What is that for?

25
00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:46.066
What coin did you pull?

26
00:00:46.066 --> 00:00:47.800
My eldest brother is wise

27
00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:48.766
Wait a minute.

28
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.300
Which one of you saw me steal?

29
00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.000
Don't you need to talk about evidence when you investigate and handle cases?

30
00:00:54.866 --> 00:00:57.233
Evidence, my brother's words are evidence

31
00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.200
I told you, boy

32
00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.166
This is suicide.

33
00:01:02.166 --> 00:01:04.033
Let you call Tiantian not working today.

34
00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:05.833
The land should not be called

35
00:01:06.266 --> 00:01:08.066
Go wait a minute

36
00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:18.000
Brother, this kid doesn't know where he got the food and water

37
00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:21.266
Kill him and it's ours

38
00:01:21.366 --> 00:01:22.700
Stand down for me

39
00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:25.700
Let me ask you something.

40
00:01:25.733 --> 00:01:27.333
Since you said it was yours

41
00:01:27.333 --> 00:01:30.166
Well, you take out another 50 carts of food

42
00:01:30.166 --> 00:01:31.366
The word is innocent

43
00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:32.600
Now the army is short of food

44
00:01:33.133 --> 00:01:34.500
If you can make a contribution

45
00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.166
I'll let you die

46
00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:40.066
Do you hear me? If Wutian can't come up with 50 shots of food

47
00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.300
Just wait to die
