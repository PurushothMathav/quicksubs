00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:02.866
Your cousin did feel wronged when she married me

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:03.800
But

3
00:00:04.766 --> 00:00:06.500
We are very close as husband and wife

4
00:00:06.666 --> 00:00:07.900
Don't bother you

5
00:00:07.933 --> 00:00:10.966
You just bullied my cousin and didn't know it.

6
00:00:10.966 --> 00:00:13.066
If I were him, I would have divorced you long ago

7
00:00:13.066 --> 00:00:14.600
What does divorce mean?

8
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.233
It's you who divorced him

9
00:00:16.766 --> 00:00:19.400
Cousin, divorce him and go to the sunset with me

10
00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.566
I'll introduce you to a few more brick girls.

11
00:00:21.933 --> 00:00:24.966
You're sure to charm a lot of people with your looks

12
00:00:24.966 --> 00:00:25.766
Lili

13
00:00:26.133 --> 00:00:27.500
How can you do that?

14
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:28.766
Don't talk about you

15
00:00:28.766 --> 00:00:30.300
It's been like this for a lifetime

16
00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.966
Not like my Prince Charming

17
00:00:32.966 --> 00:00:34.900
Still waiting for me to go back at sunset

18
00:00:35.266 --> 00:00:35.900
You see

19
00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.800
This pocket watch is actually a token of love from him

20
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.066
Sister Xiaoting, I really want this too

21
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.400
Actually, I want to give you something

22
00:00:53.066 --> 00:00:54.500
What about this watch?

23
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:55.900
I don't know what a token of love is

24
00:00:56.066 --> 00:00:57.066
You take it first

25
00:00:57.766 --> 00:00:58.633
watch

26
00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.900
Where did you get the watch from?

27
00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:03.800
Right.

28
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:06.766
I heard from Lili that this thing is very expensive.

29
00:01:07.366 --> 00:01:08.166
I can't.

30
00:01:08.166 --> 00:01:09.333
Oops daughter-in-law

31
00:01:09.333 --> 00:01:10.900
This thing was given to me by a foreigner

32
00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:12.100
It's worthless.

33
00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:13.900
Don't burden it with your palms

34
00:01:14.133 --> 00:01:16.300
Impossible. Who will make your watch?

35
00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.200
You must have bought it with all your possessions

36
00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.166
Don't try to fool me

37
00:01:19.166 --> 00:01:20.000
sir

38
00:01:20.166 --> 00:01:22.766
Is it true? Since you don't believe it?

39
00:01:23.166 --> 00:01:25.200
Come open it and show them

40
00:01:26.133 --> 00:01:27.366
Gadgets like this

41
00:01:27.566 --> 00:01:28.700
I have a lot.

42
00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.033
How could it possibly be worth anything?

43
00:01:30.866 --> 00:01:32.800
Give it to Xiao He

44
00:01:32.966 --> 00:01:35.733
Ask him to arrange a piece for each of his staff

45
00:01:35.733 --> 00:01:38.033
And learn how to use it

46
00:01:40.966 --> 00:01:42.566
Are you dreaming?

47
00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:43.400
Xiaoping

48
00:01:43.966 --> 00:01:45.000
This is for you.

49
00:01:45.466 --> 00:01:46.633
Thank you sir

50
00:01:46.766 --> 00:01:48.366
If I were a teenager too

51
00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.333
There's certainly no shortage of this

52
00:01:50.333 --> 00:01:52.966
Wu Tian, you ruined everything for me
