00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:00.900
Xiaoting

2
00:00:06.166 --> 00:00:07.766
Is it okay? I'm fine.

3
00:00:08.066 --> 00:00:08.966
Wu Tianhan

4
00:00:08.966 --> 00:00:11.433
I just said that as a last resort

5
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:12.866
You can't blame me, can you?

6
00:00:12.866 --> 00:00:14.766
I almost killed Xiaoting just now

7
00:00:14.966 --> 00:00:16.500
How do you want me to forgive you?

8
00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.933
Please don't kill me

9
00:00:18.933 --> 00:00:20.000
Xiaoting Xiaoting

10
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.966
Save me Xiaoting

11
00:00:20.966 --> 00:00:22.000
Help me, Xiaoting

12
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.366
Help me

13
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.266
Help me

14
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.000
Go to Xiaoting

15
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.800
Go out Xiaoting

16
00:00:28.166 --> 00:00:29.800
Xiaoting save me Xiaoting

17
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.400
Ah, Professor Wu

18
00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:34.766
You adults don't remember villains

19
00:00:34.766 --> 00:00:36.266
Just treat me like a fart

20
00:00:36.266 --> 00:00:38.733
I don't care how this person is handled

21
00:00:38.733 --> 00:00:39.666
The mayor said

22
00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:41.100
Let you call the shots

23
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.366
Take this person down and follow the strict instructions

24
00:00:43.366 --> 00:00:45.700
Ask other spies next time

25
00:00:47.466 --> 00:00:51.133
Hey, don't try it, don't hit me, I'll tell you everything

26
00:00:51.133 --> 00:00:52.200
I'll tell you everything.

27
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.166
We have to.

28
00:00:54.166 --> 00:00:55.266
Just joined the Li family

29
00:00:55.266 --> 00:00:57.400
Please forgive me.

30
00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:58.500
Help, please forgive me.

31
00:00:58.733 --> 00:01:00.400
Yes, the death penalty is forgiven

32
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.566
The living crime punishes you to build the offensive

33
00:01:03.766 --> 00:01:05.266
Sorry Wu family

34
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.500
I caught Li Jiahao.

35
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.666
Do you want to give me some rewards?

36
00:01:09.666 --> 00:01:10.800
What rainy day

37
00:01:10.866 --> 00:01:12.400
And the face is successfully spared

38
00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.433
No one can spare your man

39
00:01:14.533 --> 00:01:16.200
Stop Wu Jiasuo

40
00:01:16.366 --> 00:01:18.100
Wu Jiasuo, you can't do this Wu Jiasuo
