00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:01.500
See commander

2
00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:05.000
It's alright, let's get out first

3
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.066
Ahaha what's the matter

4
00:00:06.066 --> 00:00:08.000
Uncle hasn't eaten this meal yet

5
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.900
Why are you in such a hurry to leave?

6
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.333
I have something to do at home

7
00:00:11.333 --> 00:00:14.200
We have to go back and deal with it ah ah yeah

8
00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:15.400
We still have something to do

9
00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:16.866
It seems my face

10
00:00:17.133 --> 00:00:18.966
It's not as important as your business

11
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.233
Nephew, commander

12
00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:26.666
I was wrong, I beg you to let us go

13
00:00:26.666 --> 00:00:27.966
Commander oops

14
00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:29.700
Uncle, what are you doing?

15
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:30.866
Get up quickly

16
00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:32.633
Send them back to rest

17
00:00:38.333 --> 00:00:39.233
Prince Commander

18
00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:40.200
I don't plug in

19
00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:42.666
Double happiness today

20
00:00:43.066 --> 00:00:44.900
It also coincides with the gathering of relatives and friends

21
00:00:45.166 --> 00:00:47.800
Wu here is a toast to everyone

22
00:00:49.933 --> 00:00:50.733
My commander

23
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:52.466
My commander is not well

24
00:00:52.466 --> 00:00:54.366
Li Jiahao in prison ran away

25
00:00:54.366 --> 00:00:55.466
What do you eat?

26
00:00:55.466 --> 00:00:56.700
How can you let the rice run away?

27
00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:58.666
Commander, I'll let you go right now

28
00:00:59.966 --> 00:01:00.800
I'm not in a bad mood

29
00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.700
Li Jiahao is just to hang other undercover agents

30
00:01:03.766 --> 00:01:06.066
So it worked.

31
00:01:06.066 --> 00:01:07.466
Then I'm going to interrogate the soldiers in the cell now

32
00:01:07.466 --> 00:01:10.066
No need, the undercover will come out by itself

33
00:01:10.066 --> 00:01:11.066
Just wait and see.

34
00:01:12.066 --> 00:01:13.366
The second young master escaped

35
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.966
These things are not cheap to borrow weapons
