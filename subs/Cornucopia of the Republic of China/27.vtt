00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.700
Hahahahaha

2
00:00:03.933 --> 00:00:05.566
The teacher is not good

3
00:00:05.566 --> 00:00:07.533
How handsome is that? You are not allowed to call me.

4
00:00:07.533 --> 00:00:10.366
Okay, that Li family man, he, he betrayed

5
00:00:10.466 --> 00:00:11.866
What are you talking about?

6
00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:13.400
Damn

7
00:00:13.533 --> 00:00:15.900
How dare you go behind my back to join Zhang Zishuai

8
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:16.700
Li siblings

9
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:18.300
What will happen to this old man?

10
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.666
Is the teacher

11
00:00:19.733 --> 00:00:21.466
Can't you go back now?

12
00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.566
The Lee family took all the ammunition

13
00:00:23.566 --> 00:00:25.200
Zhang Dashuai's soldiers are attacking

14
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.266
If you go back now, you will die.

15
00:00:30.066 --> 00:00:31.866
How could things be like this?

16
00:00:31.866 --> 00:00:33.566
Hey, teacher

17
00:00:33.766 --> 00:00:35.200
I have an idea

18
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.466
What are your ideas?

19
00:00:36.466 --> 00:00:38.433
Come prepared today.

20
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.133
We have no chance of winning

21
00:00:40.133 --> 00:00:41.266
Only surrender

22
00:00:41.733 --> 00:00:45.366
If you care that the second captain is handsome and the division commander will go there

23
00:00:45.366 --> 00:00:46.700
Sister, shameless, the teacher still has face

24
00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:47.900
Our culture

25
00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:50.200
Can't be a pack of lions at this time?

26
00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.300
If you continue to resist now

27
00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:53.600
When will it be?

28
00:00:53.666 --> 00:00:54.966
Us brothers

29
00:00:54.966 --> 00:00:56.866
No one is dead

30
00:00:56.933 --> 00:00:57.966
Stop talking

31
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.000
Let me think about it, big brother.

32
00:01:01.166 --> 00:01:03.200
Big brother, what's going on outside now?

33
00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.466
Brother, hurry up and pack your things

34
00:01:05.466 --> 00:01:06.833
Leave this patrol town

35
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.266
So as not to come naked

36
00:01:08.266 --> 00:01:10.566
Brother, no matter what difficulties happen

37
00:01:10.566 --> 00:01:12.800
If you need my help, just say so.

38
00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.166
I can definitely help

39
00:01:14.166 --> 00:01:15.000
you

40
00:01:15.966 --> 00:01:17.066
You can't help

41
00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.566
The family took all their hopes away

42
00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.666
Now handsome troops are coming to the city

43
00:01:21.666 --> 00:01:23.566
It's useless even if the time comes.

44
00:01:23.566 --> 00:01:26.433
Brother, if you just get ammunition

45
00:01:26.566 --> 00:01:27.866
I can help you get it out.
