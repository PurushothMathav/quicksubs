00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:01.433
Mr. Second

2
00:00:01.666 --> 00:00:02.800
What's going on?

3
00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:04.633
Aren't you stealing something to mess with you?

4
00:00:05.133 --> 00:00:07.733
Blind, you stupid bitch

5
00:00:07.733 --> 00:00:10.100
I don't need to keep 50 of your hair rooms.

6
00:00:10.866 --> 00:00:12.166
Dear 50 Long

7
00:00:12.166 --> 00:00:14.133
Please join me

8
00:00:14.133 --> 00:00:15.366
Let's talk inside

9
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.133
Let him in.

10
00:00:17.133 --> 00:00:18.866
Oh, my God

11
00:00:18.866 --> 00:00:21.000
You finally showed up

12
00:00:22.766 --> 00:00:24.400
How can you curse?

13
00:00:24.766 --> 00:00:26.700
Lili, are you alright?

14
00:00:27.466 --> 00:00:29.466
Cousin, your husband is going too far

15
00:00:29.466 --> 00:00:31.300
If you have money, you have money. What's so great about it?

16
00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.200
Can you invite a foreigner to act?

17
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.600
Lili, what do you mean by that?

18
00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.166
Don't think I don't know

19
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.433
In real combat, they wouldn't be so rude

20
00:00:39.566 --> 00:00:41.666
You think you can just find a foreigner to act

21
00:00:41.666 --> 00:00:43.500
Can you pretend to be Mr. Second Brother?

22
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Say you are here to see my jokes

23
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.033
No Lili

24
00:00:47.566 --> 00:00:49.100
I really don't know about this.

25
00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:50.666
But I promise you.

26
00:00:51.166 --> 00:00:53.200
Sir, he will never find someone to act

27
00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.233
You still quibble

28
00:00:54.666 --> 00:00:57.066
Is it Mr. Second Brother that I can't recognize?

29
00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.266
Lili, wait a minute.

30
00:01:05.366 --> 00:01:06.233
Second young master

31
00:01:08.466 --> 00:01:09.266
Xiaoping

32
00:01:10.766 --> 00:01:13.066
Xiaoping, how are you doing?

33
00:01:13.666 --> 00:01:17.100
Did you have a good life and you forgot about me?

34
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.200
I have arranged for someone to rescue you.

35
00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:21.166
Wait a minute.

36
00:01:21.366 --> 00:01:22.600
I'll be out soon.

37
00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.200
I'll tell you what.

38
00:01:24.533 --> 00:01:26.300
Your target soldier is engraved on my hand

39
00:01:26.666 --> 00:01:28.100
If I die

40
00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.300
I will definitely hire you first
