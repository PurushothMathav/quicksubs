00:00:13.466 --> 00:00:14.366
master

2
00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:17.766
Master, why are you here?

3
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.266
You are still doing things more Dragon King

4
00:00:24.066 --> 00:00:25.000
teacher

5
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.500
Just repaired your wound

6
00:00:30.366 --> 00:00:34.200
It also limits you

7
00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.400
Lifted from now on

8
00:00:37.933 --> 00:00:39.066
A general apology

9
00:00:39.766 --> 00:00:42.166
Useless to you

10
00:00:44.733 --> 00:00:45.533
restriction

11
00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:49.700
You are a celebrity

12
00:00:50.466 --> 00:00:51.300
At first

13
00:00:52.066 --> 00:00:55.333
I'm also looking for a celebrity body

14
00:00:55.333 --> 00:00:59.766
Think about the situation you were in at the time

15
00:00:59.766 --> 00:01:01.766
This dish saved you

16
00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.266
This is why I'm worried that you put your heart and soul into it.

17
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.066
So

18
00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:11.166
Parents calmly

19
00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.566
Your strength

20
00:01:12.666 --> 00:01:14.100
I see

21
00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.433
All right.

22
00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.966
Now take your mission to the next level

23
00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.166
I have nothing

24
00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.100
So worried

25
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.866
Ah, you will go to the bookstore later.

26
00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.500
I'm also going to thank you

27
00:01:32.533 --> 00:01:34.633
Yes you are right

28
00:01:35.166 --> 00:01:38.700
Does the granddaughter of the library have any ideas?

29
00:01:40.133 --> 00:01:41.100
idea

30
00:01:42.733 --> 00:01:45.500
Master, we meet again for the first time

31
00:01:46.866 --> 00:01:48.466
Not really. No, actually.

32
00:01:48.966 --> 00:01:52.666
Not at all, master

33
00:01:54.733 --> 00:01:56.200
Ah!

34
00:01:57.266 --> 00:01:59.033
Hahaha
