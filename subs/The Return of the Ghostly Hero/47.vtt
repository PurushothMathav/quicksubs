00:00:07.966 --> 00:00:09.266
What will you do now?

2
00:00:09.566 --> 00:00:12.100
I should have known better than that.

3
00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:14.566
I have a way to choose passersby first

4
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.866
Isn't God Lu not coming?

5
00:00:16.866 --> 00:00:19.233
How did you change your mind?

6
00:00:20.066 --> 00:00:21.966
If there is no invitation letter

7
00:00:22.133 --> 00:00:23.700
Kneel down and bark like a dog

8
00:00:23.733 --> 00:00:25.300
I can reward you alone.

9
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.200
Oh, by the way, Master Lu said

10
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.800
You can enter without an invitation.

11
00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:33.033
Come on show

12
00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:34.600
How about this, Mr. Sun?

13
00:00:34.966 --> 00:00:36.233
Let's make a bet

14
00:00:36.266 --> 00:00:37.900
If I could get in

15
00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:39.866
You get on your knees and bark three times.

16
00:00:40.533 --> 00:00:41.566
And vice versa.

17
00:00:41.566 --> 00:00:45.200
Well, I'd like to see what you can do

18
00:00:46.766 --> 00:00:49.500
Aunt Sun learns to bark

19
00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:50.966
I don't think so.

20
00:00:51.866 --> 00:00:54.300
The name of the enterprise garden flower, Jing Han, is really unable to enter

21
00:00:55.766 --> 00:00:58.433
Sun Dasheng, I don't know if you've heard of it.

22
00:00:58.533 --> 00:01:00.733
Never heard of Ghost Valley

23
00:01:00.733 --> 00:01:02.433
What about the sage in clothes?

24
00:01:02.466 --> 00:01:04.000
no.

25
00:01:04.866 --> 00:01:07.300
It's a loss for your Sun family to pick up a big family by yourself

26
00:01:08.133 --> 00:01:09.866
Then I'll show you

27
00:01:10.933 --> 00:01:11.766
OK.

28
00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:15.966
Hello, sir.

29
00:01:15.966 --> 00:01:17.366
Please show me your invitation letter
