1
00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:01.400
110 million.

2
00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:03.100
150 million.

3
00:00:03.566 --> 00:00:04.600
What 100 million?

4
00:00:04.866 --> 00:00:06.800
Snow White, I see

5
00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:09.300
This road is clear, it's here to make trouble

6
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.566
This land is not worth that much at all

7
00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:15.400
That loser doesn't have that much money at all

8
00:00:15.566 --> 00:00:17.200
The reason why he bid so much

9
00:00:17.266 --> 00:00:18.433
Just set me up

10
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.266
Let me lower the price to the highest

11
00:00:21.333 --> 00:00:22.633
I see

12
00:00:23.066 --> 00:00:24.466
Let's make sure.

13
00:00:24.466 --> 00:00:26.266
Let him save and get the coin

14
00:00:26.366 --> 00:00:28.966
I think he can eat it.

15
00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:30.800
This time

16
00:00:31.333 --> 00:00:33.500
I'm going to make him completely unable to answer

17
00:00:33.733 --> 00:00:36.200
You are 50 million 180 million

18
00:00:36.333 --> 00:00:37.966
Two hundred million 300 million

19
00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.033
The land west of the city belongs to you
