00:00:00.966 --> 00:00:03.100
Don't say it before you get out of here

2
00:00:03.266 --> 00:00:05.100
You're not looking for someone

3
00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.500
I want to murder you again and again

4
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:08.666
Tell me about your feelings.

5
00:00:08.966 --> 00:00:12.166
After my investigation and speculation during this time

6
00:00:12.333 --> 00:00:15.433
This matter will definitely be shared with Zhang Sen later.

7
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.800
But if we go to Zhang Sen now

8
00:00:19.933 --> 00:00:21.366
Even if you beat him to death

9
00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.100
He can't succeed either

10
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.400
And your Zhang Sen's power will definitely not be able to do this

11
00:00:27.566 --> 00:00:28.566
So

12
00:00:30.166 --> 00:00:31.000
OK

13
00:00:32.366 --> 00:00:34.700
As expected of my good woman

14
00:00:35.133 --> 00:00:36.400
That makes sense.

15
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.600
Su Lao, I think

16
00:00:42.966 --> 00:00:44.200
Zhang Sen's group

17
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:45.600
And the black hand behind it

18
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.633
It's got to be something.

19
00:00:48.733 --> 00:00:52.100
If I could play cards in the mall

20
00:00:52.933 --> 00:00:55.800
The beautiful woman behind me must have sacrificed her life for me

21
00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.966
Hmm, that makes sense.

22
00:00:58.266 --> 00:00:59.500
That being the case

23
00:00:59.533 --> 00:01:01.800
As long as you will marry my granddaughter

24
00:01:02.266 --> 00:01:03.900
I will give you 100 million.

25
00:01:04.933 --> 00:01:07.900
Beat the war head-on in business

26
00:01:08.766 --> 00:01:11.633
Otherwise, you will always give me a mysterious soul

27
00:01:11.733 --> 00:01:13.033
I'll tell you what.

28
00:01:13.066 --> 00:01:14.800
If you dare to agree

29
00:01:14.866 --> 00:01:16.866
I'll let you go when I say it

30
00:01:20.933 --> 00:01:23.033
You don't like us, do you?

31
00:01:23.466 --> 00:01:25.633
Still don't like our losers

32
00:01:25.966 --> 00:01:28.633
Maybe it means something to an old man like me

33
00:01:28.866 --> 00:01:29.700
No, no, no.

34
00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:33.033
I lost to you and Miss Shu

35
00:01:33.266 --> 00:01:35.266
Only gratitude and admiration

36
00:01:35.266 --> 00:01:38.533
How could it be? Then why didn't you agree?

37
00:01:38.533 --> 00:01:41.466
Hmph, you have an opinion on my brain pain.

38
00:01:42.766 --> 00:01:43.866
lost

39
00:01:48.133 --> 00:01:49.633
OK, lose that

40
00:01:50.333 --> 00:01:51.466
I promise you.
