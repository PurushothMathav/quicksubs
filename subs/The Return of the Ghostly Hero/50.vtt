00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:01.166
Butler Ye

2
00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:03.866
I do my own thing

3
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:07.433
Master Sun

4
00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:10.800
If you feel like getting on your knees and learning to bark

5
00:00:10.933 --> 00:00:12.500
As if it were your face

6
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.233
I wouldn't mind doing it my own way

7
00:00:15.733 --> 00:00:16.566
Let you travel

8
00:00:16.566 --> 00:00:18.166
Right? What?

9
00:00:21.133 --> 00:00:22.866
You dare to touch me today

10
00:00:22.966 --> 00:00:26.033
I made your life worse than death

11
00:00:29.266 --> 00:00:30.866
Let you try pouring water.

12
00:00:32.533 --> 00:00:33.366
Road

13
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:35.466
What do you have to do?

14
00:00:35.466 --> 00:00:36.600
I told you.

15
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:38.466
I want you to travel

16
00:00:38.466 --> 00:00:41.100
Does not learning mean learning to bark?

17
00:00:41.133 --> 00:00:41.933
My name is

18
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:43.200
My name is

19
00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:46.500
Ah!

20
00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.000
Ah deputy messenger

21
00:00:59.533 --> 00:01:00.566
In front of you

22
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.166
The hatred of passers-by

23
00:01:10.533 --> 00:01:11.966
I made a note.

24
00:01:12.266 --> 00:01:13.600
You wait for me.
