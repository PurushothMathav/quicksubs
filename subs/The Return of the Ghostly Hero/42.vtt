00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:00.800
Dad?

2
00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:03.300
You've seen a woman kick me out of the house

3
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:04.100
presumptuous

4
00:00:04.866 --> 00:00:07.833
Open your mouth a woman a woman

5
00:00:07.966 --> 00:00:09.600
Mind your own business

6
00:00:10.266 --> 00:00:12.300
Don't carry such a waste all day

7
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.233
Dangling in front of my eyes

8
00:00:14.866 --> 00:00:17.566
Uncle Shu, you are a piece of trash

9
00:00:17.666 --> 00:00:19.066
Then what are you?

10
00:00:19.066 --> 00:00:20.166
What do you mean?

11
00:00:20.166 --> 00:00:22.433
In fact, Uncle Shu

12
00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:24.700
You and I have a lot in common.

13
00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:26.966
Although the book family has a great career

14
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.300
But all this seems to have been laid down by Shulang

15
00:00:30.566 --> 00:00:33.300
What does this have to do with you?

16
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.300
Presumptuous if

17
00:00:35.966 --> 00:00:37.000
All juniors

18
00:00:37.133 --> 00:00:38.600
I advise you

19
00:00:38.733 --> 00:00:40.400
Infect this woman

20
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.100
You will soon be in the mouths of others

21
00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:44.766
passerby

22
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.833
Honey, look at him

23
00:00:49.333 --> 00:00:52.066
Peacock, both of you get out of here

24
00:00:52.666 --> 00:00:53.466
OK

25
00:01:09.366 --> 00:01:11.300
You have eaten 3 plates

26
00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:12.233
Time to stop

27
00:01:15.666 --> 00:01:17.666
Do you think I'm funny too?

28
00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:20.666
You should know

29
00:01:20.666 --> 00:01:23.100
People halfway through you know this kind of thing

30
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.333
It can be done.

31
00:01:25.333 --> 00:01:26.133
So

32
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.966
You don't have to be familiar with it.

33
00:01:30.366 --> 00:01:31.266
Tonight?

34
00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.466
Why didn't I answer my phone call all day?
