00:00:00.933 --> 00:00:02.600
I didn't expect it.

2
00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:06.166
You old monster is still alive

3
00:00:06.166 --> 00:00:08.766
Hahahaha

4
00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.700
You inmates

5
00:00:12.666 --> 00:00:15.666
Nature can't be clear

6
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.033
This is against God's will

7
00:00:18.133 --> 00:00:19.366
against nature

8
00:00:19.733 --> 00:00:21.766
You will be damned

9
00:00:21.766 --> 00:00:24.300
Hahahahahahahahahahaha

10
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.200
Hahaha

11
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:26.900
Ah!

12
00:00:28.933 --> 00:00:30.033
Scourge

13
00:00:30.966 --> 00:00:33.800
Hahahahaha

14
00:00:34.133 --> 00:00:37.100
I can live to this day

15
00:00:38.466 --> 00:00:42.633
Don't you think God has blessed me?

16
00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:43.500
Humph

17
00:00:43.566 --> 00:00:47.066
Today is your driver's death

18
00:00:47.066 --> 00:00:48.300
Dare to be presumptuous

19
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.433
I'll give it back to you when you die

20
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:52.800
Stop

21
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.333
Said how are you

22
00:00:56.333 --> 00:00:57.266
Lu Ban Xiaoyong

23
00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:58.766
I'm fine.

24
00:00:59.166 --> 00:01:02.200
It's just that this old monster has lived too long

25
00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.233
You have to be careful

26
00:01:05.733 --> 00:01:07.700
Uncle, don't worry.

27
00:01:07.733 --> 00:01:10.300
Who gave you the courage?

28
00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:11.800
Can say this

29
00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:14.433
Bai Menglan, I really guessed right

30
00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.633
You really have become a member of the Han family

31
00:01:18.133 --> 00:01:20.066
Why are you afraid?

32
00:01:20.066 --> 00:01:21.100
Let me tell you something.

33
00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:22.700
It's too late.

34
00:01:22.766 --> 00:01:25.533
From the moment you step into these chambers

35
00:01:25.533 --> 00:01:28.533
Your fate is already sealed

36
00:01:28.533 --> 00:01:29.833
Are you now?

37
00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:31.500
There's only one way

38
00:01:31.933 --> 00:01:33.266
That is death

39
00:01:33.566 --> 00:01:34.366
Blue Dream Blue

40
00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.700
You do this every time.

41
00:01:36.866 --> 00:01:39.700
Every time you feel like you've won

42
00:01:40.066 --> 00:01:41.366
But which time

43
00:01:41.866 --> 00:01:43.066
You had won.
