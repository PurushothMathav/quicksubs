00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:01.633
What am I looking at?

2
00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:03.966
Just take care of your own two-person world

3
00:00:04.133 --> 00:00:05.033
We don't disturb each other.

4
00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:07.633
Come on, I'll show you our bedroom

5
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.000
Lend me to play, don't go too far

6
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.100
This is your father's house and mine

7
00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:16.566
Strictly speaking

8
00:00:16.566 --> 00:00:19.200
You're just one of my dad's toying with my dad

9
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.466
Are you married?

10
00:00:20.666 --> 00:00:21.466
You're not married?

11
00:00:21.466 --> 00:00:24.200
What right do you have to say this is your home?

12
00:00:27.333 --> 00:00:28.366
Otherwise

13
00:00:28.933 --> 00:00:31.733
You are now a member of the Han family in the capital

14
00:00:31.733 --> 00:00:33.300
Still in our little places

15
00:00:34.666 --> 00:00:37.266
Oops, the Han family in Beijing

16
00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.300
That's a big family

17
00:00:39.566 --> 00:00:41.666
After you arrive in the capital

18
00:00:42.333 --> 00:00:45.500
Maybe Qi can still climb the children of the Han family

19
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.266
Stop huohuo, I'm the daughter of the Zhu family

20
00:00:48.333 --> 00:00:49.166
Yes I don't

21
00:00:50.133 --> 00:00:52.500
Maybe the opposite is true.

22
00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.000
I didn't report any children of the Han family

23
00:00:55.333 --> 00:00:58.400
You did report a woman from the Han family

24
00:00:59.133 --> 00:01:01.200
Passerby, don't talk nonsense

25
00:01:01.666 --> 00:01:03.900
The Han family in Beijing is a big family

26
00:01:04.066 --> 00:01:05.466
What does it have to do with me?

27
00:01:06.466 --> 00:01:07.466
It doesn't matter to me.

28
00:01:07.766 --> 00:01:09.800
Maybe only you know it.
