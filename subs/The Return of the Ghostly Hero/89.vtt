00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.700
Daughter, you invited me to join Lao Zhidong

2
00:00:05.166 --> 00:00:07.166
I don't remember now.

3
00:00:07.166 --> 00:00:09.200
If you let me go now, don't bother me

4
00:00:09.266 --> 00:00:10.366
I'll let him go

5
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.566
It's the other way around.

6
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.133
What dog are you?

7
00:00:19.133 --> 00:00:20.566
You are about to make such a mistake

8
00:00:20.766 --> 00:00:21.700
I beg you

9
00:00:22.933 --> 00:00:24.066
Please let me go

10
00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:25.966
If I don't promise you

11
00:00:25.966 --> 00:00:26.766
I beg you.

12
00:00:26.766 --> 00:00:28.466
Don't promise grandpa deer

13
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.433
I am the only winter seedling in the winter vacation

14
00:00:30.666 --> 00:00:31.700
If you kill me

15
00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:33.200
My dad won't let you go

16
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.400
We're gonna be a family

17
00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:37.566
It doesn't have to be like this

18
00:00:37.566 --> 00:00:39.233
If your dad is looking for my room

19
00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.266
I'll ask your dad to disappear together

20
00:00:43.766 --> 00:00:45.200
Our Han Family

21
00:00:45.666 --> 00:00:47.800
After all, it is also the day to go from death to home

22
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.600
Are you really not afraid?

23
00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.100
In my eyes

24
00:00:52.666 --> 00:00:56.033
The four major families in Yingcheng, please be like ants

25
00:00:56.666 --> 00:00:58.433
Not worth mentioning at all

26
00:00:58.666 --> 00:01:00.833
Then why did you pass the pastoral meeting?

27
00:01:01.566 --> 00:01:03.100
Enter my Han house

28
00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.266
That's my business.

29
00:01:06.066 --> 00:01:07.500
I don't need you to live for me

30
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.033
If you still want to live

31
00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.233
Quickly untie my sister and fiancee

32
00:01:24.066 --> 00:01:24.866
brother

33
00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:26.700
Yeah.

34
00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.200
Go ahead.

35
00:01:37.666 --> 00:01:39.233
How do you want to die?
