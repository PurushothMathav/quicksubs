1
00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:04.200
The master is a living arhat, but not a living arhat

2
00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:06.066
You're just a thug

3
00:00:06.066 --> 00:00:07.600
This has nothing to do with you

4
00:00:07.766 --> 00:00:09.000
You step back first

5
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.800
Dragon Lord

6
00:00:12.566 --> 00:00:16.033
Can we talk to them now?

7
00:00:16.866 --> 00:00:17.666
OK

8
00:00:23.366 --> 00:00:25.066
Shake hands in the end

9
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.366
What do you want, prince?

10
00:00:27.766 --> 00:00:29.133
Where is my passerby?

11
00:00:29.133 --> 00:00:30.966
I'm not unreasonable.

12
00:00:30.966 --> 00:00:32.266
I came today.

13
00:00:32.366 --> 00:00:35.700
It's about kidnapping my sister for your son

14
00:00:36.166 --> 00:00:38.166
It's called Qianger

15
00:00:38.166 --> 00:00:41.100
I said I was a passerby

16
00:00:46.733 --> 00:00:48.766
You are not a master

17
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.433
You are an angel

18
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.700
The prince pays homage to the heavenly master

19
00:00:52.866 --> 00:00:55.033
Meet the Heavenly Master

20
00:00:56.966 --> 00:00:59.166
Then you say this

21
00:00:59.533 --> 00:01:00.800
How to understand

22
00:01:02.966 --> 00:01:06.000
Bah sister 500,000 as a mental loss

23
00:01:06.066 --> 00:01:06.866
500,000

24
00:01:07.333 --> 00:01:09.166
No 1 million

25
00:01:09.333 --> 00:01:12.266
No no 2 million 2 million

26
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.033
Then how do you say it should be solved?

27
00:01:17.466 --> 00:01:18.633
How about Mr. Peng

28
00:01:19.466 --> 00:01:21.166
My passerby is in your eyes

29
00:01:21.566 --> 00:01:23.300
Is it just for 5 bucks?
