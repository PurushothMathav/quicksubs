00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:03.633
OK, I see.

2
00:00:07.533 --> 00:00:09.566
I just had someone inquire.

3
00:00:09.566 --> 00:00:11.966
This passerby really didn't die

4
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:13.700
How is that possible?

5
00:00:13.966 --> 00:00:15.400
I also got news

6
00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:18.266
This passerby wants to conduct business

7
00:00:18.466 --> 00:00:20.800
To take away everything that was lost before

8
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.366
That being the case

9
00:00:22.533 --> 00:00:24.566
Then I will accompany them to the end

10
00:00:25.666 --> 00:00:28.466
Then he has such low self-esteem.

11
00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.966
Why don't you rest tonight?

12
00:00:39.866 --> 00:00:40.700
Silly woman

13
00:00:40.766 --> 00:00:42.766
When are you going to propose marriage to our family?

14
00:00:42.766 --> 00:00:44.000
I'll tell you what.

15
00:00:44.066 --> 00:00:45.600
If you don't propose marriage again

16
00:00:46.133 --> 00:00:48.066
My aunt will let me be so bored again

17
00:00:48.466 --> 00:00:50.366
Don't worry tonight.

18
00:00:50.366 --> 00:00:52.633
Lu Ran is just a waste

19
00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:55.000
He's no match for me at all

20
00:01:06.666 --> 00:01:07.466
passerby

21
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.400
I didn't expect me to be Zhang Sen

22
00:01:11.266 --> 00:01:13.000
Standing safely in front of you again

23
00:01:13.733 --> 00:01:16.500
Zhang Sen, you didn't expect it, did you?

24
00:01:16.966 --> 00:01:18.600
With my two Anshan

25
00:01:19.066 --> 00:01:20.400
I'm fine too

26
00:01:22.933 --> 00:01:24.466
Except for Mingda

27
00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.233
Zhang Sen, you seem to be interested in the wasteland in the west of the city

28
00:01:32.866 --> 00:01:33.666
bound to win
