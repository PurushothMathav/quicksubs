00:00:10.666 --> 00:00:11.466
Wow

2
00:00:17.066 --> 00:00:19.133
Does it look good? It looks good. It looks good.

3
00:00:19.133 --> 00:00:21.100
Do you like it?

4
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:22.900
Do you want to take it back?

5
00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.600
Think about it

6
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:26.700
Junjun's repeated looks

7
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:29.500
How can you tempt an idle person like me to watch it again?

8
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
If you look again, I will gouge out your eyeballs and you

9
00:00:34.333 --> 00:00:35.800
Didn't you see the two of us?

10
00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.000
Still dancing there

11
00:00:37.733 --> 00:00:40.000
It turned out to be the Great Commander and Young Master Ma Liang?

12
00:00:40.466 --> 00:00:42.100
The little girl is also distracted

13
00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:43.900
Please forgive me.

14
00:00:44.166 --> 00:00:46.200
Such a big imperial teacher

15
00:00:46.333 --> 00:00:47.400
Just you.

16
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.066
Tell me what tricks the imperial teacher has

17
00:00:50.266 --> 00:00:53.566
The state minister asked the little girl to wait here for the two of you

18
00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:54.633
And?

19
00:00:55.366 --> 00:00:58.266
Then send the two on their way

20
00:00:58.766 --> 00:01:02.266
Just because you are powerless

21
00:01:02.266 --> 00:01:03.600
See this copper order

22
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.366
I can cut your head off

23
00:01:06.366 --> 00:01:09.100
In terms of force, I am naturally not as good as the two

24
00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.266
But who says we have to win?

25
00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.866
To send you on your way

26
00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.966
It's not good to run quickly, it's the smell of gunpowder burning

27
00:01:21.733 --> 00:01:24.033
Alright. Alright.

28
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.100
How far can you run?

29
00:01:26.766 --> 00:01:28.033
How far do you run

30
00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.433
Where are you going anyway?
