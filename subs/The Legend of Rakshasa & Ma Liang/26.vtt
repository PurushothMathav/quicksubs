00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.166
Brother, why are you doing this?

2
00:00:07.166 --> 00:00:08.400
From now on

3
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:09.500
No right or wrong

4
00:00:09.566 --> 00:00:10.300
Only faction

5
00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:11.766
It's not a righteous act

6
00:00:11.766 --> 00:00:13.500
The starting point is even less righteous

7
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.600
I don't want him to sink into the dye vat

8
00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:17.266
Out of the mud without staining

9
00:00:17.266 --> 00:00:18.166
Don't you think

10
00:00:18.166 --> 00:00:20.500
Can he help you find a different path?

11
00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.066
The road is made by people

12
00:00:22.066 --> 00:00:24.166
If you walk too much, you will inevitably get muddy.

13
00:00:24.466 --> 00:00:25.966
I'm enough for this kind of thing

14
00:00:25.966 --> 00:00:27.600
Since you decide

15
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.400
I'm sure I can't say more

16
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:30.966
I'm not qualified to care about you

17
00:00:30.966 --> 00:00:32.266
Everything be careful

18
00:00:32.366 --> 00:00:33.866
If things go wrong

19
00:00:33.966 --> 00:00:35.500
Just leave by yourself

20
00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:36.700
Don't worry about me.

21
00:00:41.266 --> 00:00:42.866
I understand the situation

22
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:44.166
You did a good job.

23
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.566
What I will arrange later is

24
00:00:46.766 --> 00:00:48.033
Her Royal Highness

25
00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:51.033
This control bug bone is really easy to use

26
00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.166
No idea.

27
00:00:55.166 --> 00:00:55.966
Ma Liang

28
00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.800
Sophie is under my control

29
00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:00.966
Let you jump again

30
00:01:01.666 --> 00:01:04.300
Can't escape the palm of my princess

31
00:01:04.333 --> 00:01:07.700
I hope you can bring me some more trouble.

32
00:01:11.333 --> 00:01:14.700
Hahahahahahaha
