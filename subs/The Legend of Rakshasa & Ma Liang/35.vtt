00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:05.300
Ahahahaha

2
00:00:05.333 --> 00:00:06.733
Hey, hey, hey.

3
00:00:06.733 --> 00:00:09.900
I wouldn't let my guard down so easily

4
00:00:10.333 --> 00:00:11.366
You are poisoned

5
00:00:11.366 --> 00:00:12.200
How can it be safe and sound?

6
00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:13.566
Are you a human or a ghost?

7
00:00:14.166 --> 00:00:17.200
The emperor's brother is indeed surrounded by wine cans and rice bags

8
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:18.866
Dare to challenge the imperial teacher

9
00:00:18.866 --> 00:00:19.766
That makes you laugh!

10
00:00:19.766 --> 00:00:21.866
Bold and sloppy

11
00:00:21.866 --> 00:00:24.066
You really sing like them

12
00:00:24.066 --> 00:00:25.800
It's just a donkey

13
00:00:30.366 --> 00:00:32.666
Has the emperor brother not appeared yet?

14
00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.833
Can't you ask my sister to go in person?

15
00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.933
It seems that I lost again this time

16
00:00:39.933 --> 00:00:41.200
Of course.

17
00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:42.733
After playing the director

18
00:00:42.733 --> 00:00:44.000
When did the emperor win against me?

19
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.500
Too bad you're so smart

20
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:47.900
But towards the imperial teacher

21
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.566
It's really good luck

22
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.466
If you join forces with me

23
00:00:52.666 --> 00:00:53.900
Wake up, brother

24
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.000
Buddha knows the power of magic

25
00:00:56.066 --> 00:00:57.433
You can't understand

26
00:00:57.533 --> 00:00:59.166
If you join forces with me

27
00:00:59.366 --> 00:01:00.166
final outcome

28
00:01:00.166 --> 00:01:02.200
That is, buried in a mass grave

29
00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.066
At least I tried

30
00:01:04.066 --> 00:01:05.166
Be worthy of your ancestors

31
00:01:05.166 --> 00:01:06.633
What's the use of that

32
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.466
Just for that sad self-comfort

33
00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.400
From now on, you don't even have the last freedom

34
00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.000
Attacking high walls is what your life is all about

35
00:01:15.733 --> 00:01:17.366
That's all.

36
00:01:17.366 --> 00:01:18.900
It's a good bet

37
00:01:19.133 --> 00:01:20.700
It's normal to lose.

38
00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.033
But I don't understand one thing

39
00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.100
Where did I lose?
