00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:14.500
I didn't expect this fruit to be really

2
00:00:15.166 --> 00:00:16.633
That's a lot.

3
00:00:16.766 --> 00:00:18.600
Let his favorite concubine

4
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.000
Die with us

5
00:00:20.166 --> 00:00:22.133
What is this to him?

6
00:00:22.133 --> 00:00:24.666
After all, in his eyes, these are not people

7
00:00:24.666 --> 00:00:26.733
It's just that he was in a trance

8
00:00:26.733 --> 00:00:28.200
The bitter old thief

9
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.233
If it falls into our hands

10
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.566
If he has to beg for death, can't he?

11
00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:35.666
I knew it!

12
00:00:35.666 --> 00:00:38.733
This little trick won't kill you

13
00:00:38.733 --> 00:00:42.766
But it's just a little gift in return

14
00:00:42.766 --> 00:00:46.600
I really like what you're doing in the bookstore

15
00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:47.600
Ha ha.

16
00:00:48.366 --> 00:00:50.133
Do you like it?

17
00:00:50.133 --> 00:00:52.366
I knew you were taking revenge

18
00:00:52.366 --> 00:00:54.166
Hey, but let me tell you

19
00:00:54.166 --> 00:00:55.466
You are too cruel

20
00:00:55.466 --> 00:00:56.666
Such a beautiful concubine

21
00:00:56.666 --> 00:00:58.200
You killed him like that?

22
00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:02.266
These things are for my generation to decorate

23
00:01:02.666 --> 00:01:05.033
It's just fleeting

24
00:01:05.266 --> 00:01:07.500
I don't have time to tell you those lies

25
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.133
Hey, what other tricks are there?

26
00:01:09.133 --> 00:01:10.900
Come on, I'll take it all

27
00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:12.300
Take a guess.

28
00:01:12.333 --> 00:01:14.933
Why did I drag you to Master Luo?

29
00:01:14.933 --> 00:01:16.266
I'm warning you!

30
00:01:16.266 --> 00:01:18.800
If you dare to touch my brother and his daughter

31
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.500
I will kill the Rakshasa dog today

32
00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.033
It doesn't matter, you can do whatever you want.

33
00:01:24.533 --> 00:01:28.400
Hey, hey, since I can establish a Rakshasa Kingdom

34
00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.200
I can build ten hundred

35
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.833
And how many of your brothers dare to exchange with me?

36
00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:38.600
Hahahaha, I'll go.

37
00:01:40.266 --> 00:01:41.066
Hey

38
00:01:42.533 --> 00:01:44.633
Liang, don't worry.

39
00:01:44.866 --> 00:01:46.800
I want all the brothers of Qi Jun soon

40
00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:48.000
Go find it with you

41
00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.766
I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm not in a hurry.

42
00:01:50.933 --> 00:01:52.766
I calm down I

43
00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:55.633
I know who can find him

44
00:01:55.733 --> 00:01:56.333
Who?

45
00:01:56.333 --> 00:01:59.000
Do you remember the prison that first saved me?

46
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
Remember where?

47
00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:02.433
There is a master
