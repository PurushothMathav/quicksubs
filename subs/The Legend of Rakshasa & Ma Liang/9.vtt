00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:07.300
Cool little cat who loves birds, what do you want to do?

2
00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:09.800
Get out of the way, we can still be friends

3
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:10.900
Just a child

4
00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:13.300
Isn't it a little too much for you to have a hard time with him?

5
00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:15.600
He's not a baby, he's a baby bird's daughter

6
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.366
As long as I can catch him

7
00:00:17.366 --> 00:00:19.100
Kids are kids.

8
00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:20.766
No matter how grand you say it is

9
00:00:20.766 --> 00:00:22.433
He can't change the fact

10
00:00:22.466 --> 00:00:24.500
If the rebels want to kidnap

11
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.300
Children come to the city's organization

12
00:00:26.333 --> 00:00:27.700
It's better to disband

13
00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.400
Your first day here.

14
00:00:29.533 --> 00:00:31.166
You have no idea of our difficulties

15
00:00:31.266 --> 00:00:33.900
Don't make excuses for your immaturity

16
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:35.100
We're all adults.

17
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.300
Don't you know?

18
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.400
Is there no casual success in the world?

19
00:00:38.766 --> 00:00:41.766
I don't care, I have to take him away today

20
00:00:41.766 --> 00:00:43.933
Hey, why don't you understand?

21
00:00:43.933 --> 00:00:46.400
It's useless even if you catch Ma Huayu now

22
00:00:46.466 --> 00:00:49.066
I surrender. I'm a painter

23
00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.533
I must still be useful when I go to the Duke's Mansion

24
00:00:51.533 --> 00:00:53.600
Who are you talking to? Don't you understand?

25
00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:54.933
It's all fake

26
00:00:54.933 --> 00:00:56.800
Just to draw you out

27
00:00:57.333 --> 00:00:58.800
He already found out

28
00:01:01.133 --> 00:01:01.933
Humph

29
00:01:01.933 --> 00:01:05.433
As expected of the younger brother of the consort, he is so sharp

30
00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:08.366
How is that possible?

31
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.266
I obviously hid it seamlessly

32
00:01:11.266 --> 00:01:13.400
Right? You don't make people laugh.

33
00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.166
No matter how well you hide

34
00:01:15.166 --> 00:01:17.800
I can't stand it. Someone doesn't want you to go back alive
