00:00:02.266 --> 00:00:03.600
Don't provoke me

2
00:00:04.266 --> 00:00:06.500
I'm not the only one who wants to know the answer

3
00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:07.833
But I'm not afraid of you saying

4
00:00:07.866 --> 00:00:10.166
The General's Office has its own channels

5
00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:11.700
So-called modification

6
00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:14.033
Before the tribulation is dead

7
00:00:14.066 --> 00:00:16.600
It's not immortal, is it?

8
00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:17.700
You're right actually.

9
00:00:17.966 --> 00:00:19.766
Princess Bird's cultivation base?

10
00:00:19.933 --> 00:00:22.566
It's far from being immortal

11
00:00:22.866 --> 00:00:24.900
So the Maliang brothers

12
00:00:25.866 --> 00:00:27.033
Are you interested?

13
00:00:27.933 --> 00:00:29.066
Go big

14
00:00:29.066 --> 00:00:30.600
What do you mean?

15
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:31.600
Say yes in advance.

16
00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.800
I am not a Rakshasa people

17
00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.766
The coaxing between you?

18
00:00:35.766 --> 00:00:37.100
I'm not really interested.

19
00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.433
Of course I know this

20
00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.666
But baby bird to brother you

21
00:00:42.666 --> 00:00:44.800
It is also an object that has to be guarded against

22
00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:46.666
After all, your older brother

23
00:00:47.333 --> 00:00:50.333
Hmph, I don't have the courage to decide with him head-on

24
00:00:50.333 --> 00:00:52.500
Does the general know a lot?

25
00:00:52.533 --> 00:00:56.500
Do you want me to help you or

26
00:00:57.066 --> 00:01:00.566
Hahahahaha, this general really didn't see the wrong person.

27
00:01:00.566 --> 00:01:03.666
That's right, it's not me who wants to mess with him

28
00:01:03.666 --> 00:01:07.000
And my Majesty, why are you here?

29
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:07.366
Hey

30
00:01:07.366 --> 00:01:10.100
These little things can be done by the minions

31
00:01:11.866 --> 00:01:12.666
Hey

32
00:01:13.066 --> 00:01:14.000
That's not true.

33
00:01:14.766 --> 00:01:16.666
Since you really want to do it

34
00:01:16.866 --> 00:01:19.966
It must be inappropriate to hide behind the scenes all the time

35
00:01:19.966 --> 00:01:21.466
Since it is His Majesty the Emperor

36
00:01:21.466 --> 00:01:23.366
How rude of that!

37
00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.800
However, I don't understand one thing.

38
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.000
Isn't the baby bird princess your biological sister?

39
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.233
Having said that

40
00:01:29.266 --> 00:01:30.100
But

41
00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.066
If it is the sister who sends your place every day

42
00:01:33.066 --> 00:01:35.666
How do you choose? I see.

43
00:01:35.666 --> 00:01:36.800
I finally understand.

44
00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.400
Why is the Rakshasa Kingdom God's Gift Ceremony?

45
00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:40.933
I didn't see His Majesty the Emperor

46
00:01:40.933 --> 00:01:42.100
That's the reason
