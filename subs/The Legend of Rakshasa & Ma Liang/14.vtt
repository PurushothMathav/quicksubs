1
00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:04.300
In a place like Rakshasa

2
00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:06.066
The rebels who want to survive

3
00:00:06.066 --> 00:00:08.100
You won't say you don't have the ability to save someone, will you?

4
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:10.000
After all, you saved me.

5
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.566
What are you going to say?

6
00:00:11.733 --> 00:00:13.966
Helping me is helping you

7
00:00:14.366 --> 00:00:15.566
Our purpose is the same

8
00:00:15.566 --> 00:00:17.766
Why not work together?

9
00:00:17.766 --> 00:00:19.166
I'm in a mess right now

10
00:00:19.266 --> 00:00:21.000
But I don't think you're right.

11
00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:22.166
That's not who we are.

12
00:00:22.166 --> 00:00:23.833
I can definitely prove it to you.

13
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:25.700
I've decided to help you.

14
00:00:26.366 --> 00:00:28.566
That's right, I forgot

15
00:00:30.466 --> 00:00:33.766
It's time to do something big. Something big.

16
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:37.866
Xiaofeifei

17
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.800
Aren't you going to protect me?

18
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.466
Why are you so far away from me?

19
00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:44.400
The first time I heard

20
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.466
Someone taking a shower should also be protected

21
00:00:46.466 --> 00:00:47.866
He said do big things

22
00:00:47.866 --> 00:00:48.833
What happened?

23
00:00:48.966 --> 00:00:52.066
Someone says every day, oops, nothing happened today.

24
00:00:52.066 --> 00:00:53.700
Let's take a bath together

25
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.166
Hey, are big things informal?

26
00:00:56.166 --> 00:00:57.933
Hey, can I tell you in advance?

27
00:00:57.933 --> 00:01:00.066
If an assassin ambushes me in the bathroom

28
00:01:00.066 --> 00:01:01.700
That's all your loss.

29
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.666
You don't have a word of the truth in your mouth, I don't believe it

30
00:01:05.666 --> 00:01:08.000
It's a pity that this car has good water.

31
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.233
Ah, help!

32
00:01:12.333 --> 00:01:14.766
Do you still want to lie to me?

33
00:01:16.966 --> 00:01:18.000
What's going on?

34
00:01:20.866 --> 00:01:23.433
Hmm, hehe, I got you

35
00:01:24.133 --> 00:01:25.800
You've been messing around in just a few days

36
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:27.800
Can it be messed up after a long time?

37
00:01:28.333 --> 00:01:29.866
Don't think I don't know what's on your mind

38
00:01:29.866 --> 00:01:31.200
Always trying to take advantage of me

39
00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:32.466
When I'm Stupid

40
00:01:32.733 --> 00:01:36.066
Oops, you're right, what are you waiting for to take off your clothes?

41
00:01:36.066 --> 00:01:37.766
Just want to know that I don't wear clothes

42
00:01:37.766 --> 00:01:39.233
What can you do with me?

43
00:01:39.533 --> 00:01:41.233
What can you do?

44
00:01:45.133 --> 00:01:46.166
necrotic

45
00:01:48.666 --> 00:01:50.966
I let you plan, have you figured it out?

46
00:01:50.966 --> 00:01:52.166
Take a bath here every day

47
00:01:53.466 --> 00:01:56.400
Ma Liang, why are you weird?
