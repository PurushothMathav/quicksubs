00:00:02.333 --> 00:00:04.600
Hahahaha everyone

2
00:00:04.866 --> 00:00:06.466
Great victory today

3
00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:07.866
We don't get drunk

4
00:00:08.333 --> 00:00:09.766
Come and drink

5
00:00:09.766 --> 00:00:10.733
That pariah girl

6
00:00:10.733 --> 00:00:12.700
It's really funny how you talk so harshly.

7
00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:13.700
Hahahaha

8
00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:16.200
Yeah, foolishly hit again and again

9
00:00:16.333 --> 00:00:17.866
I am an indestructible scholar

10
00:00:17.966 --> 00:00:20.266
He also doesn't consider the possibility of being broken

11
00:00:20.266 --> 00:00:22.733
That is, the general has long pulled out the inner hardness

12
00:00:22.733 --> 00:00:24.900
Prepare the gunpowder defense wall

13
00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.433
Hahaha

14
00:00:26.566 --> 00:00:30.566
I'm sure he will take advantage of Dafeng Tiangong City

15
00:00:30.866 --> 00:00:32.866
Bone like a beautiful yellow-haired girl

16
00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:35.766
Hahaha, come and wait for me. A toast to the general

17
00:00:36.066 --> 00:00:37.700
Do it, do it

18
00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:38.500
Hmm drink

19
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:40.400
Come on, come on.

20
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.966
Report to the general

21
00:00:42.966 --> 00:00:44.566
The city is on fire

22
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.100
What's going on?

23
00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:47.200
What's the fire?

24
00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:48.000
know not

25
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:48.900
Just now

26
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.466
Suddenly there was a fire all over the city

27
00:00:50.466 --> 00:00:52.900
Many brothers were burned to death by the fire

28
00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:53.866
Go and see

29
00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:56.100
Yes

30
00:00:57.733 --> 00:01:00.100
The same reason for bullying Zuo Fei is here

31
00:01:00.466 --> 00:01:02.766
Surrenderers are spared

32
00:01:03.566 --> 00:01:05.833
Sophie has been driving all day

33
00:01:05.933 --> 00:01:08.700
How could there be any spare energy to come with me?

34
00:01:14.333 --> 00:01:16.000
The rebels take an oath here

35
00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:19.800
From then on, the bookstore painted its own land

36
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.266
Not subject to Rakshasa control

37
00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:25.400
How dare the untouchables be so arrogant

38
00:01:26.666 --> 00:01:29.766
There is no distinction between high and low

39
00:01:29.766 --> 00:01:31.766
It is no longer the Rakshasa Shu Land

40
00:01:32.466 --> 00:01:34.800
I'll give you three nights to leave.

41
00:01:35.866 --> 00:01:39.100
Otherwise, I will wait for the power of the sword

42
00:01:39.533 --> 00:01:41.866
I will let you grow up
