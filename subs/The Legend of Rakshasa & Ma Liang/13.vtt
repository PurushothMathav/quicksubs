00:00:05.366 --> 00:00:05.600
person

2
00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:09.200
I took it to the Duke's Mansion for you and let you drop the money

3
00:00:09.333 --> 00:00:10.600
But you remember

4
00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:12.966
You only have three days.

5
00:00:13.966 --> 00:00:14.866
Untie him

6
00:00:18.333 --> 00:00:21.166
Oops, it still tastes good.

7
00:00:22.133 --> 00:00:23.233
Are you all right?

8
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.133
Can you hear me?

9
00:00:25.133 --> 00:00:25.966
OK

10
00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.600
Oh, right, right.

11
00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:29.566
I forgot.

12
00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:31.266
You scum

13
00:00:31.266 --> 00:00:32.100
Shameless

14
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:33.766
Even if you beat me to death

15
00:00:33.766 --> 00:00:34.833
I will also follow you.

16
00:00:35.333 --> 00:00:36.133
Ah.

17
00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:38.966
Why kill you?

18
00:00:38.966 --> 00:00:40.966
If you want to persecute a woman

19
00:00:40.966 --> 00:00:42.466
There are better ways

20
00:00:42.566 --> 00:00:43.600
Hey what are you doing

21
00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.633
I am a famous ugly woman in Rakshasa

22
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:47.900
In our Gada

23
00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:50.433
You are the beauty of beauties

24
00:00:50.533 --> 00:00:51.433
villain

25
00:00:51.533 --> 00:00:54.066
You don't want to get any benefit from me

26
00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:55.733
Oh no no no no no no no

27
00:00:55.733 --> 00:00:57.233
I'm scared, okay?

28
00:00:57.266 --> 00:00:58.300
I'm out of luck

29
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.100
Joking with a man who admits death

30
00:01:01.566 --> 00:01:03.733
What a scumbag like you said

31
00:01:03.733 --> 00:01:05.166
I don't believe it at all

32
00:01:05.166 --> 00:01:06.200
If it weren't for me

33
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.466
You've already become cannon fodder for killing chickens and monkeys

34
00:01:08.466 --> 00:01:09.900
Now you can stand here and curse

35
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.866
Isn't that great luck?

36
00:01:11.866 --> 00:01:14.800
Don't think I don't know you just want to take advantage

37
00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:18.000
You don't really think I do anything

38
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.266
You have to.

39
00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:21.533
The third leader of the insurgent army

40
00:01:21.533 --> 00:01:22.933
Sounds awesome.

41
00:01:22.933 --> 00:01:23.966
But what about reality?

42
00:01:23.966 --> 00:01:25.533
You've been arrested for more than ten days

43
00:01:25.533 --> 00:01:28.700
Did the vat ever try to save you?
