00:00:04.466 --> 00:00:06.900
Brother, um, are you looking for me?

2
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:08.500
Hey, third sister

3
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:10.333
Brother Ma Liang is alright

4
00:00:10.333 --> 00:00:12.766
He's okay, he's just seriously injured

5
00:00:12.766 --> 00:00:14.600
I'm resting now.

6
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:15.666
Seriously injured

7
00:00:15.666 --> 00:00:16.566
big brother

8
00:00:16.933 --> 00:00:19.900
What's the matter with you? Why are you babbling?

9
00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.200
Nothing. Just wanted to talk to you

10
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.400
After you personally entered the Duke's Mansion

11
00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:25.766
Did you find anything?

12
00:00:25.766 --> 00:00:28.833
I found that chicks can be a tough character

13
00:00:28.966 --> 00:00:30.500
He doesn't just know magic

14
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:34.066
And quite capable, of course.

15
00:00:34.066 --> 00:00:36.866
If he were a gelatinocyte raising a chef

16
00:00:36.866 --> 00:00:38.766
It won't be so difficult for us.

17
00:00:38.766 --> 00:00:40.500
Hahaha hey

18
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.800
What about the second brother? Why didn't I see him?

19
00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.466
You said second brother

20
00:00:45.733 --> 00:00:47.266
Second brother

21
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:48.466
Be careful behind you

22
00:00:50.966 --> 00:00:54.400
Brother, why is this? Why?

23
00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:57.866
Of course, it's because you only need one leader to bully the king.

24
00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:59.566
You pariahs

25
00:00:59.666 --> 00:01:01.900
How dare you cooperate with me

26
00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.666
There will be a bloodline in charge
