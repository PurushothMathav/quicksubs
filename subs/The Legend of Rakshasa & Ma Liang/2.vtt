00:00:02.066 --> 00:00:03.266
Not necessarily in jail

2
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:03.966
I told you

3
00:00:03.966 --> 00:00:06.766
No matter how thin you are, you may die suddenly, right?

4
00:00:06.766 --> 00:00:08.866
Don't you think that's unreasonable?

5
00:00:10.133 --> 00:00:10.933
OK

6
00:00:11.766 --> 00:00:12.566
Ah!

7
00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:16.200
You're free to go.

8
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.600
Find a place to live well

9
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:19.566
You are Yumian Rakshasa

10
00:00:19.566 --> 00:00:21.800
We're not going with you, you heretic

11
00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.000
ignorance

12
00:00:23.566 --> 00:00:25.566
What about you? Of course I'm leaving.

13
00:00:25.566 --> 00:00:26.533
This boss is the smallest

14
00:00:26.533 --> 00:00:28.433
But I also love the smell of freedom

15
00:00:28.566 --> 00:00:30.200
Hurry up, there's no time

16
00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:31.566
Okay, hey.

17
00:00:31.733 --> 00:00:32.800
Slow down.

18
00:00:33.466 --> 00:00:36.066
Ten miles east is Rakshasa City

19
00:00:36.066 --> 00:00:37.833
It's the place where they're best informed.

20
00:00:38.066 --> 00:00:40.000
It should be able to help you find your brother

21
00:00:40.133 --> 00:00:41.400
Thank you girl

22
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:45.333
What about you? It's not good to be too close to me.

23
00:00:45.333 --> 00:00:46.666
mountains and rivers

24
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.266
Let's just say goodbye.

25
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.566
The water in this Rakshasa country is quite deep

26
00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.733
The first beauty of Raksha Kingdom, the baby bird princess

27
00:00:55.733 --> 00:00:57.300
Something happened at home again

28
00:00:57.333 --> 00:00:59.833
Are you talking about that Jianming concubine?

29
00:01:00.066 --> 00:01:01.400
Right?

30
00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.400
Back then, with a Jiuxian piano

31
00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:05.000
Won the heart of the young bird

32
00:01:05.066 --> 00:01:06.766
You have been in Rakshasa for so long

33
00:01:06.766 --> 00:01:08.766
Why are you so stubborn, little hoof?

34
00:01:12.933 --> 00:01:13.733
Hey

35
00:01:15.166 --> 00:01:18.000
The baby bird princess you just mentioned can't be asked.

36
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.133
Let's be more specific

37
00:01:19.133 --> 00:01:21.500
I heard that the princess caught the concubine

38
00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.366
Secretly flirting with other women

39
00:01:23.466 --> 00:01:25.900
Locked up the concubine for several days

40
00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.066
Consort cheating is so exciting

41
00:01:28.066 --> 00:01:29.866
It was a backdoor

42
00:01:29.866 --> 00:01:32.066
The consort is a pariah again

43
00:01:32.266 --> 00:01:34.466
If it weren't for the fact that young birds like piano, chess, calligraphy and painting

44
00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.033
It doesn't matter if you kill him

45
00:01:37.866 --> 00:01:40.800
Oh, I don't know what the name of the concubine will be

46
00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:42.333
Dude, you don't know

47
00:01:42.333 --> 00:01:44.100
You are afraid that you have lived in the mountains for a long time, right?

48
00:01:44.666 --> 00:01:46.800
The consort's name is Ma Ji
