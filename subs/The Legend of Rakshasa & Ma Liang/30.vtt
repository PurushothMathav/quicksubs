00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:03.600
What do you mean?

2
00:00:04.166 --> 00:00:06.666
Do you already fully understand?

3
00:00:06.766 --> 00:00:09.133
If I don't understand something so simple

4
00:00:09.133 --> 00:00:11.666
How could I come to this Rakshasa Kingdom alone?

5
00:00:11.666 --> 00:00:13.966
Don't blow the cow to the sky, those two

6
00:00:13.966 --> 00:00:16.200
Does this thing need to be bragged about?

7
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.500
It is nothing more than the national dissatisfaction with the national teacher

8
00:00:18.533 --> 00:00:20.866
As for the emperor, he doesn't want to be the prince in the palm of his hand

9
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:24.300
Hahaha, well said, well said.

10
00:00:24.366 --> 00:00:26.966
Since the founding of the Rakshasa Kingdom for a thousand years

11
00:00:26.966 --> 00:00:30.300
All emperors have tried to change this

12
00:00:30.366 --> 00:00:32.900
I want the Rakshasa Kingdom to become my Rakshasa Kingdom

13
00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:34.866
Unfortunately, the laws of the country

14
00:00:35.533 --> 00:00:36.800
Bundle nationwide

15
00:00:37.133 --> 00:00:38.466
Can't object at all

16
00:00:38.466 --> 00:00:39.266
ask

17
00:00:39.533 --> 00:00:42.266
A general soldier who can barely walk with one punch

18
00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:43.700
How to fight

19
00:00:43.733 --> 00:00:46.600
Imperial Preceptor, this powerful ancestor team position

20
00:00:47.333 --> 00:00:49.333
If I'm right

21
00:00:49.333 --> 00:00:50.900
Every time the emperor ascends the throne

22
00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:54.066
The Doctor will bestow spells on those around him

23
00:00:54.066 --> 00:00:55.633
To invite the emperor

24
00:00:55.766 --> 00:00:57.333
After all, brothers and sisters

25
00:00:57.333 --> 00:01:00.133
Is it impossible to divide easily by his side?

26
00:01:00.133 --> 00:01:01.266
Won my heart

27
00:01:01.366 --> 00:01:02.600
Won my heart

28
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.900
But there's one thing I don't understand.

29
00:01:05.266 --> 00:01:07.933
His Majesty has nothing to do with the baby bird princess

30
00:01:07.933 --> 00:01:09.066
Brotherhood

31
00:01:09.066 --> 00:01:11.466
A few days ago, above the Heaven-sent Cauldron

32
00:01:11.466 --> 00:01:12.933
The young bird once killed a man

33
00:01:12.933 --> 00:01:14.533
That is my queen

34
00:01:14.533 --> 00:01:17.366
Now he doesn't treat me as a royal brother

35
00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.000
I don't have to put up with him anymore

36
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.600
Your Majesty must have a plan

37
00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:23.533
General

38
00:01:23.533 --> 00:01:25.433
Give him the stuff
