00:00:09.333 --> 00:00:10.500
This unconscionable

2
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.466
Let's cut down trees and wait for his news

3
00:00:12.666 --> 00:00:14.133
Since he said so

4
00:00:14.133 --> 00:00:15.366
We'll just recruit

5
00:00:15.366 --> 00:00:17.800
Do you have any opinions, Datong?

6
00:00:17.966 --> 00:00:19.866
Now the chicks are guarding Hucheng

7
00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:20.966
How many troops

8
00:00:20.966 --> 00:00:22.900
Do you have a way to close it?

9
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.466
But you can't be a salted fish, can you?

10
00:00:26.266 --> 00:00:27.700
What is he going to do?

11
00:00:27.733 --> 00:00:29.033
Be patient.

12
00:00:29.166 --> 00:00:31.800
It's a tug of war after all

13
00:00:32.466 --> 00:00:33.266
Fox City to train

14
00:00:33.266 --> 00:00:35.166
What did Lord Ma Liang catch by the chick?

15
00:00:35.666 --> 00:00:37.500
What's the situation?

16
00:00:39.933 --> 00:00:41.366
Mr. Ma Liang

17
00:00:41.566 --> 00:00:44.700
This time you have fallen into the hands of this general

18
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.566
I don't understand.

19
00:00:46.566 --> 00:00:48.333
Who leaked the news?

20
00:00:48.333 --> 00:00:49.200
My brother

21
00:00:49.933 --> 00:00:51.200
That's impossible.

22
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.266
You are like a ghost

23
00:00:53.266 --> 00:00:55.633
Still have to drink Lao Tzu's foot wash

24
00:00:55.733 --> 00:00:56.666
What do you mean?

25
00:00:56.666 --> 00:00:58.866
You didn't figure it out.

26
00:00:58.866 --> 00:01:01.566
The owner of the inn is one of my Dibbs

27
00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.866
My foot wash secret drug

28
00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.100
How does it taste? I'll go

29
00:01:10.766 --> 00:01:13.600
I said, why is there a bad smell in my mouth?

30
00:01:13.733 --> 00:01:17.200
Go and call me your supervisor

31
00:01:17.333 --> 00:01:19.900
If it's late, I'll be outdated

32
00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:25.800
You are courting death, hey, hey, hey, stop it.

33
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.800
Don't beat him to death

34
00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:28.800
Baby Bird Princess

35
00:01:28.966 --> 00:01:31.800
I haven't seen you for a while. How are you doing?

36
00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.766
I'm having a good time.

37
00:01:33.766 --> 00:01:37.633
It's the little bird princess, you're having a very embarrassing time, aren't you?

38
00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.300
The Yin Yin Dog Boil of a Lost Dog

39
00:01:40.766 --> 00:01:43.233
It just makes me feel sorry for you

40
00:01:43.466 --> 00:01:44.966
Believe it or not

41
00:01:44.966 --> 00:01:46.700
You're gonna have to get me out of town
