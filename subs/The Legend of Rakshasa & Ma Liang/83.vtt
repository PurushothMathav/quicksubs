1
00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:06.866
You can open the door

2
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.066
Please, please let me go

3
00:00:09.066 --> 00:00:11.166
I'm very useful, please let me go

4
00:00:15.566 --> 00:00:17.166
Liang is fine

5
00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.533
Since you say he has the ability to predict

6
00:00:19.533 --> 00:00:21.666
Then he will definitely leave a clue

7
00:00:22.266 --> 00:00:26.600
Rare for the old gentleman's divination ability

8
00:00:26.866 --> 00:00:28.466
He's not leaving like this anymore

9
00:00:28.466 --> 00:00:30.466
Find it

10
00:00:50.466 --> 00:00:51.433
Wait a minute

11
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:52.466
We believe

12
00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.033
I can't believe that.

13
00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:58.700
You see the words here

14
00:01:00.766 --> 00:01:02.366
See blood like a human

15
00:01:03.166 --> 00:01:05.266
How is A Liang doing recently?

16
00:01:05.266 --> 00:01:06.100
Count the days

17
00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:07.800
We've been apart for half a year

18
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.700
I'll give you a hexagram on a whim

19
00:01:09.933 --> 00:01:12.166
But found that there seems to be a powerful man in Tianji Pavilion

20
00:01:12.166 --> 00:01:13.866
Shoot and don't let you investigate

21
00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:15.500
But the art of the road 50

22
00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:16.966
Sky Eye 49

23
00:01:16.966 --> 00:01:19.900
The clock taken at once cannot be hidden

24
00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.133
I see it, but it's blurry.

25
00:01:22.133 --> 00:01:23.900
I can't give you a definite answer.

26
00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:25.266
But I can tell you

27
00:01:25.266 --> 00:01:27.300
The person you are looking for is far away

28
00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:28.700
What is the origin?

29
00:01:29.133 --> 00:01:30.500
As expected of a master

30
00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.066
Since you can play against a thousand-year-old power like the imperial teacher

31
00:01:34.466 --> 00:01:36.133
Still win half a son

32
00:01:36.133 --> 00:01:38.500
Do you already know where the state affairs are?

33
00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:39.766
Exactly.

34
00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:41.966
I already know where it is.
