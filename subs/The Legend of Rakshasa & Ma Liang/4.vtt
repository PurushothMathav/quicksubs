00:00:02.966 --> 00:00:04.666
Oh no no no no no wait wait wait

2
00:00:04.666 --> 00:00:07.100
Don't worry, I really mean no harm.

3
00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:08.600
I really want to thank you.

4
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.300
Stop pretending here

5
00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:12.400
Unexpectedly, there were traitors in the rebel army

6
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.366
Betray me, you misunderstood

7
00:00:14.366 --> 00:00:16.800
My brother is the horse trail forcibly taken away by the young bird

8
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.633
How could I possibly be your enemy?

9
00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:20.833
What a bitter trick to see

10
00:00:27.366 --> 00:00:29.100
The baby bird princess arrives

11
00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:30.633
idler retreat

12
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.100
Consort

13
00:00:36.266 --> 00:00:39.633
It's been so many days and you still won't say it

14
00:00:39.766 --> 00:00:42.666
Come and give the concubine the rules

15
00:00:49.266 --> 00:00:51.900
Not going well yet

16
00:00:52.566 --> 00:00:54.300
Add some ingredients to the concubine

17
00:00:58.666 --> 00:00:59.466
Humph

18
00:01:00.533 --> 00:01:01.733
Although I have heard of it

19
00:01:01.733 --> 00:01:04.100
I didn't expect my brother to be in such danger

20
00:01:04.466 --> 00:01:07.866
Was that your brother just now?

21
00:01:08.533 --> 00:01:09.966
He has been in the house for many years

22
00:01:09.966 --> 00:01:11.366
Today is good

23
00:01:11.366 --> 00:01:13.733
I can't believe my brother's love poems

24
00:01:13.733 --> 00:01:15.366
To sink in a place like this

25
00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.400
The so-called couple that young birds like

26
00:01:18.733 --> 00:01:21.766
Birches are arty

27
00:01:22.466 --> 00:01:25.066
Just treat the hook as an elegant person

28
00:01:25.066 --> 00:01:27.700
I'm a sheep in the tiger's mouth

29
00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:29.200
A bumping deer

30
00:01:29.466 --> 00:01:30.933
And rightly so.

31
00:01:30.933 --> 00:01:34.100
Without me
