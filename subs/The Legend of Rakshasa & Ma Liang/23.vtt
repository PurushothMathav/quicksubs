00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:05.266
Hahaha general

2
00:00:11.133 --> 00:00:13.266
Well, don't be safe, General?

3
00:00:13.266 --> 00:00:16.466
Who am I? It turned out to be my niece's spelling head?

4
00:00:16.566 --> 00:00:18.266
The general doesn't seem surprised.

5
00:00:18.266 --> 00:00:19.900
You keep me here

6
00:00:19.933 --> 00:00:21.533
Don't just want to humiliate me

7
00:00:21.533 --> 00:00:22.766
I'm still thinking about it.

8
00:00:22.766 --> 00:00:24.266
Someone should be here

9
00:00:24.266 --> 00:00:25.066
This is not

10
00:00:25.333 --> 00:00:26.266
There you are.

11
00:00:26.266 --> 00:00:28.766
Don't you feel bad having you replace you?

12
00:00:28.766 --> 00:00:30.066
In Rakshasa

13
00:00:30.466 --> 00:00:32.033
The imperial teacher is heaven

14
00:00:32.166 --> 00:00:33.833
Don't say let me replace

15
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:36.666
Even if it kills me, I have to smile

16
00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.133
Hey, I didn't mention the imperial teacher a word.

17
00:00:40.133 --> 00:00:42.600
I will not argue with you needlessly

18
00:00:42.733 --> 00:00:45.400
Come on, what are you going to do if you're stupid?

19
00:00:46.733 --> 00:00:48.666
Oops this time

20
00:00:48.666 --> 00:00:50.966
I really didn't receive orders from the so-called princess

21
00:00:50.966 --> 00:00:53.533
I'm just representing myself, yourself.

22
00:00:53.533 --> 00:00:55.566
Hahahaha

23
00:00:55.733 --> 00:00:56.600
ridiculous

24
00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.066
You have long been branded with the identity of the chick

25
00:00:59.333 --> 00:01:01.666
It's impossible to run

26
00:01:02.333 --> 00:01:04.066
Saying so much, what about the answers I want?

27
00:01:04.066 --> 00:01:05.633
Put Rolning back out

28
00:01:05.733 --> 00:01:09.066
I can move to the chick uh huh

29
00:01:10.566 --> 00:01:12.600
Hey, General Fruit is a happy talk.

30
00:01:16.966 --> 00:01:19.000
Come to my general's mansion tomorrow

31
00:01:19.266 --> 00:01:20.666
Let me introduce you to someone

32
00:01:20.666 --> 00:01:21.800
He can help you.

33
00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.766
It's not easy to go to the general's mansion

34
00:01:23.766 --> 00:01:25.800
After all, I'm still a person in the Duke's Mansion

35
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:27.966
If you can't go, it's your business.

36
00:01:27.966 --> 00:01:29.666
If this can't be done

37
00:01:29.866 --> 00:01:31.733
That just means you're not capable

38
00:01:31.733 --> 00:01:33.100
Not worthy to cooperate with me

39
00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:35.233
Hahahaha

40
00:01:36.766 --> 00:01:38.700
No, it's too dangerous

41
00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:39.666
I don't agree with that.
