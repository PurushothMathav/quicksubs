00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:04.066
What's your opinion?

2
00:00:04.066 --> 00:00:06.166
The lake city is next to the river

3
00:00:06.166 --> 00:00:08.200
When the rainy season comes

4
00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:09.633
Water level rises

5
00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:12.400
The whole city will be submerged

6
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.700
Old man, this lake city has been here for hundreds of years

7
00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:17.266
Been through countless rainstorms?

8
00:00:17.266 --> 00:00:19.700
I've never heard of a city being flooded

9
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.400
That's because...

10
00:00:21.666 --> 00:00:25.600
There are three large rivers in the west and The North Face of Pucheng to replenish water

11
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.533
Flows out of the big river in the south

12
00:00:27.533 --> 00:00:29.933
Just plug the river to the south

13
00:00:29.933 --> 00:00:31.666
When the rainstorm comes

14
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.900
Yancheng was flooded

15
00:00:39.766 --> 00:00:40.900
I see.

16
00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:42.933
You asked us to cut down trees to block the South River

17
00:00:42.933 --> 00:00:43.733
Right?

18
00:00:43.866 --> 00:00:45.400
Yes, yes, you little smart guy

19
00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.100
Hey, of course.

20
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.800
Everyone says I'm smart

21
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.300
I asked how your business went.

22
00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:51.200
And it didn't work.

23
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.466
Can't blame me for that. Of course there's no problem.

24
00:00:53.666 --> 00:00:55.533
Fu Tongling has been cutting down trees for three days

25
00:00:55.533 --> 00:00:56.866
No rest at all

26
00:00:56.866 --> 00:00:59.200
What about you?

27
00:01:00.766 --> 00:01:03.300
Of course I'm responsible for thinking of you

28
00:01:06.066 --> 00:01:08.766
Okay, I'll go see how he's busy

29
00:01:16.666 --> 00:01:19.066
Okay, the little brothers are gone

30
00:01:23.166 --> 00:01:23.966
younger brother

31
00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.966
Ah, I just barely had an innovation book

32
00:01:27.366 --> 00:01:29.400
I didn't expect it to be so powerful

33
00:01:30.533 --> 00:01:32.200
I hope that after this battle

34
00:01:32.333 --> 00:01:33.566
No more strife

35
00:01:33.566 --> 00:01:34.833
How is that possible?

36
00:01:35.133 --> 00:01:36.900
The fruit is still waiting for us

37
00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:39.300
That's a long way to go.

38
00:01:39.866 --> 00:01:41.500
Baby bird

39
00:01:41.866 --> 00:01:44.200
Don't worry, brother, your taste is so heavy.

40
00:01:44.366 --> 00:01:45.633
It will definitely help you live out

41
00:01:46.066 --> 00:01:47.433
That's not what I meant.

42
00:01:47.733 --> 00:01:50.866
No matter what happens to the chick, he deserves it

43
00:01:50.933 --> 00:01:52.366
I'm only worried about the light rain.

44
00:01:52.533 --> 00:01:54.233
After all, he is still young.

45
00:01:54.366 --> 00:01:55.533
Don't worry.

46
00:01:55.533 --> 00:01:58.200
If he wants to go home, he will naturally go back in unison.

47
00:01:58.266 --> 00:01:59.500
Just watch
