00:00:02.533 --> 00:00:04.900
Did I come at a bad time?

2
00:00:07.566 --> 00:00:08.500
big brother

3
00:00:09.466 --> 00:00:10.633
Yeah.

4
00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:12.700
Big brother came at a bad time

5
00:00:12.966 --> 00:00:14.766
Are you kind to see me too?

6
00:00:14.766 --> 00:00:17.500
It's a pity that I have been in Rakshasa for so many years

7
00:00:17.733 --> 00:00:20.600
I've never even seen a herb that restores my cultivation

8
00:00:20.733 --> 00:00:23.000
Only some elixir for internal injuries remains

9
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.900
You can drink it when it's done.

10
00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.200
Doctor in Rakshasa Kingdom Large-scale reverse extraction

11
00:00:27.466 --> 00:00:30.600
Nature doesn't allow opposition.

12
00:00:30.666 --> 00:00:33.633
Harvesting spirit grass is also expected

13
00:00:33.666 --> 00:00:34.933
It's just that

14
00:00:34.933 --> 00:00:37.366
I don't know when my cultivation will come back

15
00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:39.300
Watching you hurt for me

16
00:00:39.366 --> 00:00:41.266
I'm really sorry.

17
00:00:42.466 --> 00:00:45.000
Brother, we are brothers

18
00:00:45.133 --> 00:00:46.200
Still care about this

19
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.166
I believe that if you reach out

20
00:00:48.166 --> 00:00:49.666
You would have made the same choice

21
00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:51.433
Of course.

22
00:00:51.666 --> 00:00:54.500
We are brothers who grew up together and are right

23
00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.200
If you are in trouble

24
00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.966
I will do my best to help you.

25
00:00:59.766 --> 00:01:01.400
So you still care about this?

26
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.400
Oh, be happy.

27
00:01:03.666 --> 00:01:05.700
Soon we can go back

28
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.566
I'm going to die soon.

29
00:01:07.566 --> 00:01:09.800
You and I have no mana

30
00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:13.800
Don't worry, the boat will naturally go straight to the bridge.

31
00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.800
Take it one step at a time.

32
00:01:15.933 --> 00:01:17.433
I've heard it said before

33
00:01:17.866 --> 00:01:20.633
This wine has no seal and it's not incomprehensible

34
00:01:22.533 --> 00:01:24.666
Well you have a way

35
00:01:25.766 --> 00:01:28.100
From the pure evil of Yuanying

36
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.200
My brother

37
00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.333
You said it, but you didn't say it.

38
00:01:34.333 --> 00:01:36.066
My brother has practiced for a hundred years

39
00:01:36.066 --> 00:01:38.300
When did I ever marry a wife?

40
00:01:38.533 --> 00:01:43.033
It's better to be willing

41
00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:45.700
Who?
