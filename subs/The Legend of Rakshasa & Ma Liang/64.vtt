00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:04.800
As soon as a person walks, the emotional intelligence is big enough

2
00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.333
Can you say it now?

3
00:00:06.333 --> 00:00:09.000
I'm really convinced these people are so big

4
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
The strength of the imperial teacher is so high that it hurts people

5
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.966
Is it difficult to monitor an uprising?

6
00:00:12.966 --> 00:00:14.700
They never practiced

7
00:00:14.733 --> 00:00:16.166
Defenders are fearless

8
00:00:16.166 --> 00:00:17.366
It's really hard life.

9
00:00:17.366 --> 00:00:20.100
Not only to sing blackface, but also to be a coolie

10
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.800
Oh, I'm really feeling bad.

11
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.900
When you say that, I think of Miss Sophie

12
00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:27.266
I cried just now

13
00:00:27.333 --> 00:00:29.500
You have to explain it later.

14
00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:30.800
What a hassle

15
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.333
Do good deeds without leaving a name

16
00:00:32.333 --> 00:00:34.466
Who else but me?

17
00:00:34.666 --> 00:00:35.700
Hey hang up

18
00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.600
This baby bird sister-in-law is really watertight

19
00:00:39.933 --> 00:00:41.800
You're being funny again

20
00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.300
However, he can be in the Rakshasa Kingdom

21
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.400
Cover the sky with one hand

22
00:00:47.566 --> 00:00:49.366
How could I not have the ability?

23
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.500
Well, it's hard to attack

24
00:00:51.533 --> 00:00:54.233
And 100,000 can't fight, can't fight at all

25
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.100
Alian

26
00:00:55.566 --> 00:00:58.566
I found that since I arrived in Hucheng

27
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.866
You seem to be in a much better mood.

28
00:01:01.866 --> 00:01:04.800
Really? I can't sleep every night.

29
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.366
Oops, you're considering whether to surrender or not

30
00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.066
It's hard to say

31
00:01:09.466 --> 00:01:12.233
But now in your eyes

32
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.366
Already responsible

33
00:01:15.466 --> 00:01:18.000
I think it's a good thing.

34
00:01:18.133 --> 00:01:19.400
Hey, I can't help it.

35
00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.566
Who made Rakshasa Fruit so strange and adventurous so cute

36
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Let's go. Last fight

37
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.333
If there is a traffic jam there

38
00:01:26.333 --> 00:01:28.700
Then we'll just have to gnaw hard
