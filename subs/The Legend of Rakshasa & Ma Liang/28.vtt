00:00:03.966 --> 00:00:05.566
Be honest and don't move

2
00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.633
Ouch, your mouth is too hard, be gentle.

3
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.333
This is all for your face.

4
00:00:10.333 --> 00:00:12.266
You really take yourself seriously, don't you?

5
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.266
Dare to make up my adult at will on the street

6
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.066
General

7
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:18.500
What's going on?

8
00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:20.066
Don't you have to explain?

9
00:00:21.466 --> 00:00:23.966
Hey, isn't this Lord Ma Liang?

10
00:00:23.966 --> 00:00:24.866
How come?

11
00:00:24.933 --> 00:00:26.600
To treat Lord Ma Liang like this

12
00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.300
Adults are ready to know

13
00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:29.166
Pay attention next time

14
00:00:29.166 --> 00:00:31.166
Lord Ma Liang came to visit me

15
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:32.566
For the first time.

16
00:00:32.566 --> 00:00:35.833
It should be the last time

17
00:00:37.966 --> 00:00:38.900
Hey!

18
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:40.766
General

19
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.766
Your reception style is really ingenious.

20
00:00:43.766 --> 00:00:45.300
The general asked you to come

21
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.366
I didn't let you scream in the street

22
00:00:47.366 --> 00:00:49.266
Is this known to everyone?

23
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.766
The point is that I'm already here.

24
00:00:51.766 --> 00:00:52.733
Hey, promise me

25
00:00:52.733 --> 00:00:54.066
Hahahaha

26
00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.233
I love talking to smart people.

27
00:00:56.266 --> 00:00:57.966
Give him a throne

28
00:00:58.600 --> 00:00:59.666
Hurry up!

29
00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:10.433
Mingren doesn't say secret words

30
00:01:10.566 --> 00:01:13.933
I want to know what the chick's cultivation level is now

31
00:01:13.933 --> 00:01:15.500
I need to know this

32
00:01:15.533 --> 00:01:18.200
I'm afraid the baby bird princess can't sleep

33
00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.400
Hmph, don't play dumb for me

34
00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:22.633
Young birds secretly practice immortality

35
00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.400
It's nothing new.

36
00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:25.766
I just want to know

37
00:01:25.766 --> 00:01:27.766
What exactly is he now?

38
00:01:28.133 --> 00:01:31.033
Does it make any difference to the general?
