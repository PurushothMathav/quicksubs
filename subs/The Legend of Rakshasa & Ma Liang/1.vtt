00:00:03.566 --> 00:00:04.766
The sun is shining.

2
00:00:04.766 --> 00:00:06.633
Have a good season

3
00:00:09.566 --> 00:00:11.800
Is Lao Liang Ma Liang?

4
00:00:11.866 --> 00:00:14.733
Brother, it's me, come to Rakshasa Kingdom as soon as possible to save me

5
00:00:14.733 --> 00:00:15.466
I'm here.

6
00:00:15.466 --> 00:00:18.000
Who are you really secretly contacting behind my back?

7
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.366
Do you want to run?

8
00:00:19.466 --> 00:00:20.566
Get it for me

9
00:00:20.766 --> 00:00:22.366
This Rakshasa country is very dangerous

10
00:00:22.366 --> 00:00:24.466
It seems that the law cannot be used at will

11
00:00:31.666 --> 00:00:33.700
I hope the dragon will fool me to rescue my brother

12
00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.666
French envoy to see Rakshasa general

13
00:00:44.666 --> 00:00:48.033
Envoy of Dongying Kingdom See Rakshasa General

14
00:00:48.133 --> 00:00:50.066
The emissaries of the two countries came to offer gifts

15
00:00:50.133 --> 00:00:52.300
I wish the general a silver plate

16
00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:53.700
It doesn't look like any trouble.

17
00:00:54.266 --> 00:00:56.300
The apprentice is still too timid

18
00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:57.100
Go

19
00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.166
Bring me the man who ghosts my grandson

20
00:00:59.166 --> 00:01:00.400
Obey the general

21
00:01:01.666 --> 00:01:03.000
Want something

22
00:01:03.733 --> 00:01:06.800
Hey, what are you doing?

23
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:07.866
What are you doing?

24
00:01:07.866 --> 00:01:09.366
The general is extremely ugly

25
00:01:09.366 --> 00:01:10.466
How to deliver

26
00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.166
Ah, let's talk

27
00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.900
Although it must be too spies to take it down for me

28
00:01:17.366 --> 00:01:19.466
Why do you say I am Jin Xin?

29
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.333
Although you are well disguised

30
00:01:21.333 --> 00:01:23.366
Female native pariah knows nothing else

31
00:01:23.366 --> 00:01:25.866
But you made a fatal mistake

32
00:01:25.866 --> 00:01:28.166
A mistake that I would never make

33
00:01:28.366 --> 00:01:29.133
What mistake?

34
00:01:29.133 --> 00:01:31.966
That is, I don't know the name of this general

35
00:01:32.166 --> 00:01:35.800
The face of this general Pan An is known all over the country

36
00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:39.666
And you dare to question this general's one-foot prime minister

37
00:01:39.866 --> 00:01:41.766
Go put him in jail

38
00:01:41.766 --> 00:01:44.166
Let him cut into the camp, don't you dare

39
00:01:44.466 --> 00:01:45.800
Brother, you are so hungry

40
00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:46.533
I still have some

41
00:01:46.533 --> 00:01:48.400
I'll give it all to you. Um, no, no, no, I'm almost full.

42
00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:49.800
Dude, don't you know?

43
00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.500
I'm here to find someone

44
00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.066
Unexpectedly, I got lost and didn't eat for three days

45
00:01:54.066 --> 00:01:55.733
This boss tastes delicious

46
00:01:55.733 --> 00:01:57.333
I even ate here

47
00:01:57.333 --> 00:01:59.400
This is Jianming Prison

48
00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:00.466
What is Jianming?

49
00:02:00.466 --> 00:02:01.866
Jianming is the skinny guy

50
00:02:01.866 --> 00:02:03.666
Why do you have to go to jail for being thin?

51
00:02:03.666 --> 00:02:04.900
Not necessarily in jail

52
00:02:04.966 --> 00:02:05.700
I told you

53
00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.666
No matter how thin you are, you may die suddenly, right?
