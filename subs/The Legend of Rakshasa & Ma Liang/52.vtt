agreed text

2
00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:21.366
Why is it a dog hole?

3
00:00:21.466 --> 00:00:22.300
I'm really convinced

4
00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:23.100
Hey

5
00:00:23.933 --> 00:00:24.733
Hey

6
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:27.500
Oh, dear.

7
00:00:28.133 --> 00:00:29.933
I can't believe my famous name

8
00:00:29.933 --> 00:00:32.066
To be destroyed on a dog hole

9
00:00:45.666 --> 00:00:47.400
What happens when you read this letter?

10
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.100
I should have arrived in Shucheng by now.

11
00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:50.766
Forgive me for leaving without saying goodbye.

12
00:00:50.766 --> 00:00:52.966
But there's no other way.

13
00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.600
You are the commander of the rebel army

14
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.400
You can't order your brothers to die

15
00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.433
And I was an outsider.

16
00:00:58.566 --> 00:00:59.766
Nothing to do with the rebels

17
00:00:59.766 --> 00:01:01.866
Naturally the best candidate

18
00:01:02.166 --> 00:01:04.366
Of course I'm not going to die

19
00:01:04.366 --> 00:01:06.133
After all, I'm an immortal

20
00:01:06.133 --> 00:01:07.833
The kind that is not dangerous

21
00:01:08.366 --> 00:01:12.000
Ah, by the way, I finally want to say something if

22
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.200
Only if

23
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.400
If I don't come back

24
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.700
You have to help me think of a way

25
00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.133
Take my hapless brother

26
00:01:17.133 --> 00:01:18.766
Rescued from the princess' mansion

27
00:01:18.766 --> 00:01:19.800
Let's go!

28
00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.033
Otherwise, you can only watch me set off fireworks.

29
00:01:23.666 --> 00:01:25.233
No, no.

30
00:01:26.066 --> 00:01:27.233
No, no.
