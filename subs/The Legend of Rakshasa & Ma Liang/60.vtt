1
00:00:06.533 --> 00:00:07.400
There you are.

2
00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:11.166
The forensic doctor went to fight with others before he recovered

3
00:00:11.166 --> 00:00:12.200
Not a big problem.

4
00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.966
I panicked when the bird plan was seen through

5
00:00:14.966 --> 00:00:17.633
He didn't realize that I was holding on

6
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.700
We have now captured two cities by the rebels

7
00:00:20.766 --> 00:00:23.266
You can rest for a while recently.

8
00:00:25.933 --> 00:00:27.300
How is that possible?

9
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.700
Can't slack off yet

10
00:00:29.133 --> 00:00:30.966
You forgot that this is Rocha

11
00:00:30.966 --> 00:00:32.300
It is the territory of the imperial teacher

12
00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:34.966
Why is it not good to rest now?

13
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:36.966
There are also like-minded

14
00:00:36.966 --> 00:00:38.000
Nature can stay

15
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.666
If not

16
00:00:39.766 --> 00:00:40.766
Let him go over there

17
00:00:40.766 --> 00:00:42.333
What you think is beautiful

18
00:00:42.333 --> 00:00:44.666
Unfortunately, this is impossible

19
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.466
Do you think Rakshasa spent 1,000 years

20
00:00:47.466 --> 00:00:50.200
Create the Rakshasa Kingdom, a world of computer black and white

21
00:00:50.266 --> 00:00:52.300
Can he allow you to live?

22
00:00:52.566 --> 00:00:54.566
That's a big deal. We're in North County

23
00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:56.300
It's a whole new country.

24
00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:57.566
What the imperial teacher wants

25
00:00:57.566 --> 00:00:58.800
It is a desire that makes him

26
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.900
A world where you can vent at will

27
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.333
And what did you do?

28
00:01:02.333 --> 00:01:05.200
It is to guide the people of Rakshasa to learn to think

29
00:01:05.466 --> 00:01:07.200
It is impossible for the country to accept

30
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.233
Why do you have to fight to the death?

31
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.466
It's not accurate.

32
00:01:14.666 --> 00:01:16.233
But to kill you

33
00:01:16.366 --> 00:01:18.166
There is no room for negotiation.

34
00:01:18.166 --> 00:01:19.566
Then you are not allowed to go either

35
00:01:19.966 --> 00:01:22.866
I can still delay it for ten days and a half months.

36
00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.200
Don't take me for a vase

37
00:01:25.533 --> 00:01:26.966
Just rest well.

38
00:01:27.133 --> 00:01:27.933
OK

39
00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:29.166
younger brother

40
00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.766
I found you some herbs for internal injuries
