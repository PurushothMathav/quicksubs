00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:04.900
I didn't expect the bookstore to get it like this

2
00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:06.766
Lead our inner responders

3
00:00:06.766 --> 00:00:08.933
Didn't they all get caught by the city guard general?

4
00:00:08.933 --> 00:00:11.433
How could it be destiny

5
00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:14.700
Maybe God is helping me

6
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.766
I said the Great Commander is the Son of Destiny

7
00:00:16.766 --> 00:00:18.900
You will definitely bring your brothers to achieve your ideals

8
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.500
You also believe it's providence

9
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:21.866
Then what?

10
00:00:22.133 --> 00:00:22.933
Yes, Commander

11
00:00:23.133 --> 00:00:25.300
Why haven't I seen Mr. Ma Liang?

12
00:00:25.566 --> 00:00:27.633
I haven't heard his broken mouth for a long time

13
00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:29.100
I'm not used to it.

14
00:00:30.066 --> 00:00:32.066
Look what this is.

15
00:00:32.366 --> 00:00:33.700
May not come back

16
00:00:34.266 --> 00:00:35.366
It turned out to be so

17
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.233
The son is careless

18
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.100
Bad luck, bad luck.

19
00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.400
I'm an immortal and I'm not dead yet

20
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:45.900
Dude sophie

21
00:00:45.966 --> 00:00:47.000
I'm back!

22
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.200
I think I'm hearing voices.

23
00:00:49.566 --> 00:00:50.800
You heard right.

24
00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:52.433
He's back!

25
00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.266
Sophie bastard

26
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.000
Hahahaha

27
00:00:59.066 --> 00:00:59.866
bastard

28
00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:02.700
Why do you have to do something so dangerous?

29
00:01:02.766 --> 00:01:04.366
Hey, okay, okay.

30
00:01:04.366 --> 00:01:05.533
I'm back, aren't I?

31
00:01:05.533 --> 00:01:07.600
I have to live for you alone

32
00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:08.600
What do you mean?

33
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.100
You and others

34
00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.666
It's shameful to dare not lead

35
00:01:12.666 --> 00:01:14.166
The villain has a heart

36
00:01:14.933 --> 00:01:17.166
I have to live a few more years for you

37
00:01:17.166 --> 00:01:19.666
How many years?

38
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Lifetime
