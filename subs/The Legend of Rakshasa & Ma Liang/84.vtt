00:00:04.133 --> 00:00:07.166
The story has nothing to do with Xiaoyu

2
00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:10.166
Crazy, he has a reason for half his life

3
00:00:10.166 --> 00:00:12.200
Since he is with you

4
00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.833
So now that he's tied up, it's also his difference

5
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.266
He's just a kid.

6
00:00:18.766 --> 00:00:19.933
I beg you.

7
00:00:19.933 --> 00:00:21.433
It doesn't matter.

8
00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:22.900
Anyway

9
00:00:22.966 --> 00:00:27.233
Soon you will say goodbye to this world

10
00:00:27.333 --> 00:00:30.500
Why did I give Ma Liang three days?

11
00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.600
If he can't find me

12
00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.000
I will kill him

13
00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.866
This is my agreement with him.

14
00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:40.433
This is the central axis.

15
00:00:41.133 --> 00:00:42.000
Here is Rakshasa

16
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.766
If so far

17
00:00:44.133 --> 00:00:45.866
He has no mana at all now

18
00:00:46.066 --> 00:00:47.700
It's impossible to get here.

19
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.200
How about that?

20
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.200
Did I seal his mana?

21
00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.200
Hahaha

22
00:00:56.133 --> 00:00:59.100
I'm not here. I

23
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:00.866
hateful

24
00:01:01.933 --> 00:01:05.600
Oh, stop struggling.

25
00:01:06.066 --> 00:01:08.200
Burned his own right path

26
00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.900
You are just like a mortal now

27
00:01:11.866 --> 00:01:15.100
You can't be right now

28
00:01:17.066 --> 00:01:17.866
OK

29
00:01:18.933 --> 00:01:20.700
I'm almost there

30
00:01:21.466 --> 00:01:22.700
Oh, dear.

31
00:01:26.333 --> 00:01:28.600
How about some?

32
00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.166
scram

33
00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.066
Tell you

34
00:01:32.933 --> 00:01:34.600
You touch my daughter

35
00:01:35.166 --> 00:01:40.366
It seems that you want to die now

36
00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:43.400
So be it.

37
00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:45.066
seating

38
00:01:45.733 --> 00:01:48.000
I'll send you on your way
