1
00:00:06.066 --> 00:00:07.600
No, what are you all looking at me for?

2
00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:08.800
It's scary.

3
00:00:09.466 --> 00:00:12.333
Ma Liang, our rebel army has more than 100,000 people

4
00:00:12.333 --> 00:00:13.266
Now.

5
00:00:13.566 --> 00:00:15.500
I think I'm sure I can take it

6
00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.066
Nonsense. Nonsense.

7
00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.000
Why are you going to the capital of Rakshasa?

8
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.700
As you said last time

9
00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:22.566
I went back and thought about it.

10
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.033
Very reasonable.

11
00:00:24.866 --> 00:00:27.466
So I decided to strike first

12
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.900
Yes, the morale of the insurgents is strong now

13
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.000
give up unprecedented

14
00:00:32.133 --> 00:00:33.400
It's a good time to build an army

15
00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:34.733
Very good spirit

16
00:00:34.733 --> 00:00:35.966
I think you're right.

17
00:00:35.966 --> 00:00:37.700
But why are you looking for me now?

18
00:00:37.733 --> 00:00:40.466
Hu Cheng has stood tall for so many years

19
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.100
I think you have so many crazy ideas.

20
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.100
Help me out

21
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.200
This is all about your rebels

22
00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:48.866
What does it have to do with me as a patient?

23
00:00:48.866 --> 00:00:50.933
I'm here to help you just to save my brother

24
00:00:50.933 --> 00:00:52.066
My brother is out now

25
00:00:52.066 --> 00:00:52.666
I don't think so.

26
00:00:52.666 --> 00:00:54.633
It's time to leave Luochang

27
00:00:54.766 --> 00:00:57.800
If you want to leave, I am not from the Rakshasa Kingdom

28
00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.066
My brother has come out

29
00:00:59.066 --> 00:01:01.033
I'm not leaving. I'm waiting for you to treat me to dinner.

30
00:01:01.533 --> 00:01:02.400
also right

31
00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:04.300
You helped me so much.

32
00:01:04.366 --> 00:01:06.100
It's time to go

33
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.266
I'm leaving now.

34
00:01:07.266 --> 00:01:10.500
Don't bother you, the commander is leaving now, the commander

35
00:01:10.966 --> 00:01:12.833
Mr. Ma Liang, rest early

36
00:01:12.933 --> 00:01:15.066
The last will go one step first
