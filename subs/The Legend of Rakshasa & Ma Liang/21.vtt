00:00:02.333 --> 00:00:04.733
This world is not as simple as you think

2
00:00:04.733 --> 00:00:06.866
I knew it, but I didn't do it.

3
00:00:06.866 --> 00:00:09.133
Then my consequences will be worse than sloppy

4
00:00:09.133 --> 00:00:11.166
I just want to live and take a step up

5
00:00:11.166 --> 00:00:12.100
Am I wrong?

6
00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:14.400
Naturally for someone like you

7
00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:16.266
But there's something I don't understand

8
00:00:16.466 --> 00:00:18.600
Is the Rakshasa Lake national master product not big enough?

9
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:19.866
Why do you bother

10
00:00:19.866 --> 00:00:22.000
To please a mere imperial teacher?

11
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.400
It's nothing but fearless ignorance.

12
00:00:25.466 --> 00:00:27.466
My Rakshasa Kingdom was founded for a thousand years

13
00:00:27.466 --> 00:00:28.966
A dozen emperors before and after

14
00:00:28.966 --> 00:00:31.600
There is only one imperial master, understand?

15
00:00:31.933 --> 00:00:35.800
With such a long life, he is grooming. Does it matter who he is?

16
00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.500
I only need to know one thing

17
00:00:38.533 --> 00:00:40.400
Lord Imperial Preceptor is supreme

18
00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:41.933
Absolutely not provocative

19
00:00:41.933 --> 00:00:44.266
He set all the rules of the Rakshasa Kingdom

20
00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.500
Don't let such an unreasonable rule

21
00:00:46.766 --> 00:00:48.033
What the hell do you know?

22
00:00:48.266 --> 00:00:50.700
The power of state affairs is boundless, you can't understand it

23
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.433
As far as your rebel army is concerned

24
00:00:52.666 --> 00:00:55.433
It's just vulnerable in front of state affairs

25
00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.600
Anyway, Ma Liang, you did a good job this time

26
00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:58.900
What reward do you want?

27
00:00:59.366 --> 00:01:01.300
Reward I don't need

28
00:01:02.266 --> 00:01:03.733
If you have to say it

29
00:01:03.733 --> 00:01:05.533
Then my brother's freedom is impossible

30
00:01:05.533 --> 00:01:07.133
Maggie can't leave the mansion

31
00:01:07.133 --> 00:01:08.200
Then give me back the pencil.

32
00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.300
That's impossible either

33
00:01:09.333 --> 00:01:10.733
I still have something for you to do

34
00:01:10.733 --> 00:01:12.500
I can't return the pencil to you until I'm done.

35
00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.200
This won't work, and neither will that.

36
00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.300
The last one has to work

37
00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:17.600
Let go
