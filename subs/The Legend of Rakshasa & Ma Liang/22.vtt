00:00:02.533 --> 00:00:04.066
Waiting for me here

2
00:00:04.533 --> 00:00:06.866
Let me tell you two things I can't promise you

3
00:00:06.866 --> 00:00:08.500
Set the stage for the third thing

4
00:00:08.566 --> 00:00:11.233
But this princess is so shameless

5
00:00:11.266 --> 00:00:13.600
I've decided now not to give you a reward.

6
00:00:14.366 --> 00:00:16.100
You really don't think about it?

7
00:00:16.166 --> 00:00:17.733
This girl is stupid and incompetent

8
00:00:17.733 --> 00:00:19.800
Staying in the mansion is a waste of food

9
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.966
I think what you said is hype

10
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.900
Impossible is impossible

11
00:00:24.366 --> 00:00:25.566
Sophie, I'm useful

12
00:00:25.566 --> 00:00:26.600
Dream on.

13
00:00:26.766 --> 00:00:28.133
So what else is there to say?

14
00:00:28.133 --> 00:00:30.266
More than half a word

15
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:31.700
position

16
00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:34.200
Come on.

17
00:00:35.066 --> 00:00:36.700
It's too late to help

18
00:00:37.566 --> 00:00:39.200
What time is it too late?

19
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.266
How bad is the impact of this broad daylight?

20
00:00:42.333 --> 00:00:44.966
Gee, I don't have time to talk about driving.

21
00:00:44.966 --> 00:00:46.100
Take off your clothes

22
00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:47.566
I'll give you a little monster in English.

23
00:00:47.566 --> 00:00:49.766
Get out of here

24
00:00:49.766 --> 00:00:51.400
Is that what you think?

25
00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:53.300
I thought you were

26
00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.300
What do you think you think?

27
00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:56.200
I am from Xi'an

28
00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.633
New compatriots do not have this worldly desire

29
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.466
I know what is fierce

30
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.700
No worldly desires yet

31
00:01:03.866 --> 00:01:06.066
If you have the ability, don't peek at me in the shower
