hateful

2
00:00:05.333 --> 00:00:07.966
I let him run away with 30,000 soldiers

3
00:00:07.966 --> 00:00:10.966
It doesn't matter if we win two games in a row

4
00:00:10.966 --> 00:00:13.266
And even took my brother away from the Duke's Mansion

5
00:00:13.266 --> 00:00:17.400
Basically killed the guts of the young bird

6
00:00:17.866 --> 00:00:19.500
It can be said that you guys succeeded

7
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:20.666
I just don't understand.

8
00:00:20.666 --> 00:00:22.600
How did you know that the baby bird copied the back?

9
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.866
You'd better ask him that.

10
00:00:29.333 --> 00:00:32.033
I really want to thank you this time, little brother.

11
00:00:32.366 --> 00:00:34.900
It's good to be back safely.

12
00:00:35.166 --> 00:00:36.500
Sophie has a question

13
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:37.800
You answer him.

14
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.133
Is it about the chick?

15
00:00:39.133 --> 00:00:40.266
It's very simple.

16
00:00:40.266 --> 00:00:42.166
I heard about their plot

17
00:00:42.166 --> 00:00:44.600
I don't believe chicks can make such a low-level mistake

18
00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.266
He certainly wouldn't make such a mistake.

19
00:00:46.266 --> 00:00:48.966
But he thought he had sealed all my cultivation

20
00:00:48.966 --> 00:00:50.433
And you're done.

21
00:00:50.733 --> 00:00:51.966
But he didn't know.

22
00:00:51.966 --> 00:00:54.000
Back then, I was making trouble with British law

23
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.666
Both ears experienced the baptism of heaven and earth spiritual energy

24
00:00:56.666 --> 00:00:58.200
It has long been a tailwind ear

25
00:00:58.566 --> 00:01:00.966
So you really overheard, right?

26
00:01:01.066 --> 00:01:02.366
It's that simple.

27
00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:04.400
Ono eat slowly

28
00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:05.833
There's a lot more here

29
00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.000
No, when can we see our mother?

30
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.100
I miss him.

31
00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.366
Will I never see him again?

32
00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:12.700
No no

33
00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:13.800
You will see

34
00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.600
Just not yet.

35
00:01:18.066 --> 00:01:19.200
