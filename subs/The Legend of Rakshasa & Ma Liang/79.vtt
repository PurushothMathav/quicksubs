00:00:02.266 --> 00:00:03.700
God Bless the Rebellion

2
00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:05.433
One battle settles the world

3
00:00:06.733 --> 00:00:08.200
God Bless the Rebellion

4
00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:09.600
One battle settles the world

5
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.733
God bless me, I want to ask the enemy army to settle the world in one battle

6
00:00:12.733 --> 00:00:15.833
God bless me, I want the uprising army to fight and settle the world

7
00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.200
One battle settles the world

8
00:00:24.666 --> 00:00:26.066
Where will the city be?

9
00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:27.666
Come out and die

10
00:00:27.733 --> 00:00:30.166
I wait for the insurgent army to break through

11
00:00:30.166 --> 00:00:32.000
United the 13th Army of the Lower Rakshasa Kingdom

12
00:00:32.133 --> 00:00:33.100
Quick surrender

13
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.600
Lest you die easily

14
00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.200
The commander doesn't know anything?

15
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:40.566
The imperial teacher has ordered

16
00:00:40.566 --> 00:00:42.800
When you see the Great Commander, open the door immediately to welcome you

17
00:00:42.933 --> 00:00:44.466
He is waiting at the National Teachers' Mansion

18
00:00:44.466 --> 00:00:46.266
What are you up to?

19
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.533
Why don't you fight with real swords and real guns?

20
00:00:48.533 --> 00:00:50.100
The commander joked

21
00:00:50.766 --> 00:00:52.666
The life of a master is heaven

22
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.533
The city gate is now open

23
00:00:54.533 --> 00:00:55.866
I'll go first

24
00:00:56.133 --> 00:00:57.000
Light it up

25
00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.933
All soldiers disarmed

26
00:00:58.933 --> 00:01:01.400
Welcome the commander into the city

27
00:01:04.566 --> 00:01:06.433
Liang, what do you think?

28
00:01:07.466 --> 00:01:09.500
Ouch, what about the child?

29
00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:10.733
See the tricks

30
00:01:10.733 --> 00:01:12.966
Let's see what medicine he sells in his gourd

31
00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:14.900
As long as you are there

32
00:01:15.666 --> 00:01:17.266
Whether it is Longtan or Tiger's Den

33
00:01:17.566 --> 00:01:19.233
I dare to break through
