00:00:02.066 --> 00:00:04.100
Ouch fruit, please save me, fruit

2
00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:05.000
Ouch haha

3
00:00:05.066 --> 00:00:06.333
The doctor is not good

4
00:00:06.333 --> 00:00:07.500
This is a drug addiction

5
00:00:07.566 --> 00:00:08.266
Incomparable desire for poison

6
00:00:08.266 --> 00:00:09.800
One bite will kill you

7
00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:11.100
Better not to act rashly

8
00:00:11.666 --> 00:00:12.666
You shut up

9
00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:13.733
Who are the statesmen?

10
00:00:13.733 --> 00:00:14.966
You can still be afraid of this thing

11
00:00:15.266 --> 00:00:17.866
Ouch, don't move, General

12
00:00:17.866 --> 00:00:19.466
Adults wait for the poison to subside

13
00:00:19.566 --> 00:00:21.400
The imperial teacher will heal you

14
00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.666
Ouch, Imperial Preceptor, you can't send death without saving it?

15
00:00:24.666 --> 00:00:26.466
Ouch, I respect you

16
00:00:28.133 --> 00:00:30.266
Ouch I am

17
00:00:30.566 --> 00:00:31.933
You forgot the little itch

18
00:00:31.933 --> 00:00:33.066
It itches.

19
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:36.766
Did the general offend this poison-eating ant?

20
00:00:36.766 --> 00:00:40.200
Use this Wugu chicken to fight poison with poison?

21
00:00:40.866 --> 00:00:43.100
Ouch, oops.

22
00:00:43.266 --> 00:00:44.866
Hey, hey, oops.

23
00:00:44.866 --> 00:00:47.400
You bent the street and bit this general's beautiful waist

24
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:48.433
This is this

25
00:00:49.466 --> 00:00:50.266
Hey

26
00:00:51.566 --> 00:00:52.366
Hey

27
00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.333
Is the general alright?

28
00:00:57.333 --> 00:00:58.366
Why don't you try

29
00:00:58.366 --> 00:00:59.800
Are you all right?

30
00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.566
You see, you are tired of living, you are

31
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.200
Hey, don't be surprised by the general

32
00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.900
It's as toxic as red poison

33
00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:06.166
Do you want to solve this matter?

34
00:01:06.166 --> 00:01:08.166
I can only rely on this five-grain attack.

35
00:01:08.166 --> 00:01:09.833
You know all about this.

36
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.666
Hey, the little one is also to protect the general

37
00:01:12.666 --> 00:01:13.600
And offended

38
00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:14.700
Hope for atonement
