00:00:02.266 --> 00:00:03.166
Baby Bird Princess

2
00:00:03.166 --> 00:00:04.700
Since I dare to come

3
00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:07.366
Naturally I won't be afraid of you, don't lie to me.

4
00:00:07.566 --> 00:00:09.366
My Duke's Mansion has many institutions

5
00:00:09.733 --> 00:00:11.900
And the formation set by the imperial teacher

6
00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:13.666
There is no one in Rocha

7
00:00:13.666 --> 00:00:15.500
The person who can forcibly take away my mansion

8
00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.333
This is your greatest failure

9
00:00:17.333 --> 00:00:18.966
You are too confident and too rigorous

10
00:00:18.966 --> 00:00:20.600
And trust no one.

11
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.266
After you discovered Sophie's identity?

12
00:00:22.266 --> 00:00:25.066
I didn't tell anyone at the bottom of the mansion and didn't deal with it?

13
00:00:25.066 --> 00:00:26.433
He worked hard.

14
00:00:26.766 --> 00:00:29.166
Impossible is it right

15
00:00:29.166 --> 00:00:31.700
That's right, in the summer eyes of the Duke's Mansion

16
00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:33.900
Sophie is your most loyal servant

17
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:34.566
Such a person

18
00:00:34.566 --> 00:00:37.200
Take my brother and niece from your mansion

19
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.600
Who will stop it?

20
00:00:38.933 --> 00:00:41.800
Ma Liangni wants to blame you for your short-sightedness

21
00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:42.866
But you're right.

22
00:00:42.866 --> 00:00:45.266
Who called the baby bird you are just a chicken

23
00:00:45.333 --> 00:00:47.200
What can you do?

24
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:48.700
Ma Liang Xiaoyou

25
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.700
This guy can't die yet

26
00:00:54.066 --> 00:00:55.633
How about selling me some face?

27
00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:56.933
Doctor

28
00:00:56.933 --> 00:00:59.133
If you really don't envy it, you want to guarantee it.

29
00:00:59.133 --> 00:01:01.000
Isn't it a bit too long?

30
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.833
Hahaha, Xiaoyoudao is a wonderful person.

31
00:01:03.933 --> 00:01:05.533
But after thousands of years of monasticism

32
00:01:05.533 --> 00:01:08.666
Wouldn't it be a joke to die without this ability?

33
00:01:08.666 --> 00:01:10.800
But I spend my time in vain

34
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.133
The North Army will send you

35
00:01:12.133 --> 00:01:13.733
As a ransom for the chicks

36
00:01:13.733 --> 00:01:15.133
Looking forward to seeing you next time.

37
00:01:15.133 --> 00:01:18.266
The old fox hides deep, you
