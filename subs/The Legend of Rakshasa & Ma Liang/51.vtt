00:00:02.166 --> 00:00:03.900
I promise. Okay.

2
00:00:04.366 --> 00:00:06.400
I didn't expect the north to be so careless

3
00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:07.566
That being the case

4
00:00:07.666 --> 00:00:09.100
Once Sucheng is forced

5
00:00:09.133 --> 00:00:11.600
My south will be dominated by the north

6
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:13.900
All follow the instructions of the northern uprising

7
00:00:13.933 --> 00:00:15.700
Then say it all

8
00:00:15.733 --> 00:00:16.833
A whip

9
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:18.966
Goodbye

10
00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:22.200
Ma Liang, why did you promise him without authorization?

11
00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:24.366
Let me send my brother to his death

12
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.166
I don't agree with that.

13
00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:27.766
Oops, what's your hurry?

14
00:00:27.766 --> 00:00:29.333
Promise me, not you

15
00:00:29.333 --> 00:00:31.800
You mean you are going by yourself?

16
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:33.900
Why not?

17
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:36.233
No. It's too dangerous

18
00:00:36.766 --> 00:00:39.500
Oh, silly boy!

19
00:00:39.533 --> 00:00:42.466
This kind of thing is only suitable for me to do?

20
00:00:42.466 --> 00:00:44.400
You forgot that I am an immortal

21
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.200
What kind of fairy are you?

22
00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.600
I know your mana hasn't been restored yet

23
00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.100
The chick has sealed your magic pen again

24
00:00:53.766 --> 00:00:56.266
You only have a little bit of strength now

25
00:00:56.666 --> 00:00:59.633
It doesn't matter, the mountain people have their own tricks

26
00:00:59.766 --> 00:01:00.366
How about you?

27
00:01:00.366 --> 00:01:03.400
Just be down to earth and be your commander-in-chief of the United Army

28
00:01:06.766 --> 00:01:07.566
Ma Liang

29
00:01:08.766 --> 00:01:10.800
If this bookstore can't be beaten down

30
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.200
We'll change it.

31
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.066
But what if something happens to you?

32
00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:17.700
What about your brother?

33
00:01:18.933 --> 00:01:20.066
What should I do?

34
00:01:20.066 --> 00:01:22.666
Hey, don't talk nonsense and mistake people's innocence.

35
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.000
I don't care.

36
00:01:24.933 --> 00:01:26.400
I just like you.

37
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.866
Just rely on you

38
00:01:28.533 --> 00:01:29.900
I won't let you go.
