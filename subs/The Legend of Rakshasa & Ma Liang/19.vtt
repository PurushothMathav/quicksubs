00:00:02.266 --> 00:00:03.066
general

2
00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:06.066
What's wrong with your face?

3
00:00:06.133 --> 00:00:07.066
Look at this.

4
00:00:07.066 --> 00:00:09.166
Why are there so many acne on the general's face?

5
00:00:09.166 --> 00:00:11.800
Uncle, you are still thin-skinned.

6
00:00:11.866 --> 00:00:14.133
Why do you still have acne at an age?

7
00:00:14.133 --> 00:00:16.000
That's funny.

8
00:00:16.133 --> 00:00:17.133
Hahaha

9
00:00:17.133 --> 00:00:20.066
It's not my face that's dead again, it's the impact?

10
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:21.966
I itch! Oops!

11
00:00:21.966 --> 00:00:23.000
How did it go?

12
00:00:23.666 --> 00:00:24.700
Is it painful?

13
00:00:25.066 --> 00:00:26.766
These big cocks are just in time

14
00:00:26.766 --> 00:00:28.500
It looks beautiful.

15
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.000
But it's not over yet.

16
00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:32.266
Hey, don't panic, General

17
00:00:32.266 --> 00:00:35.100
Here are the herbs, there is a panacea

18
00:00:36.466 --> 00:00:38.100
This medicine is for treating

19
00:00:38.466 --> 00:00:40.833
Red poison with this highly poisonous thing

20
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.300
General, please move to the back hall to take medicine.

21
00:00:44.366 --> 00:00:45.666
How can you be so kind?

22
00:00:45.666 --> 00:00:46.633
I don't mind him.

23
00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:50.100
Hey.

24
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:52.966
Hey, so comfortable

25
00:00:52.966 --> 00:00:53.933
That's what it feels like.

26
00:00:53.933 --> 00:00:56.500
Hey hey hey give me some give me some

27
00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:57.366
Oh, dear.

28
00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.666
Ah well, oops general

29
00:01:01.666 --> 00:01:02.733
Your prosperous face

30
00:01:02.733 --> 00:01:05.366
Can't fold on this little red-bellied chair

31
00:01:05.466 --> 00:01:06.566
Try it on.
