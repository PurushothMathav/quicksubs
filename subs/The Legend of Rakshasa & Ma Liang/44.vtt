00:00:03.933 --> 00:00:05.266
How did that happen?

2
00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:07.000
Ah, it's okay to pretend

3
00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.666
Oh, you are such a fool.

4
00:00:09.666 --> 00:00:11.100
Why are you so naive?

5
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:12.433
What do you mean?

6
00:00:12.566 --> 00:00:14.800
Do you remember when the chicks targeted you?

7
00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:16.066
What did he say?

8
00:00:16.066 --> 00:00:16.866
Ah!

9
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:19.266
He said, "Hello?"

10
00:00:19.266 --> 00:00:20.500
I don't want to go back and see you

11
00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:23.833
Who do you think is the last person to see you go back?

12
00:00:23.966 --> 00:00:26.000
Are you suspecting big brother?

13
00:00:26.333 --> 00:00:27.866
He was so nice to me.

14
00:00:27.866 --> 00:00:30.266
You are still too naive

15
00:00:30.333 --> 00:00:32.800
Do you remember the goal of the insurgent army?

16
00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.333
Breaking down inequality

17
00:00:34.333 --> 00:00:35.800
Put the fat and thin

18
00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.933
The beautiful and the ugly live a happy life

19
00:00:38.933 --> 00:00:41.566
Your dreams are very good

20
00:00:41.566 --> 00:00:43.300
But along the way

21
00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:45.566
Didn't you find anything?

22
00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.066
You said that, but I remember

23
00:00:49.066 --> 00:00:51.366
I don't seem to have seen the second brother's person, right?

24
00:00:52.333 --> 00:00:53.633
There we go.

25
00:00:53.866 --> 00:00:55.166
What about this great commander?

26
00:00:55.166 --> 00:00:57.400
Despite the talk of pursuing equality

27
00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:58.466
But in fact

28
00:00:58.466 --> 00:01:00.333
Eat and drink spicy food by yourself

29
00:01:00.333 --> 00:01:02.466
And there are brothers in the camp eating bark

30
00:01:02.466 --> 00:01:03.400
That's impossible.

31
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:05.500
This uprising army?

32
00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.166
It was founded by the eldest brother

33
00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:08.566
No way

34
00:01:08.766 --> 00:01:10.533
If I'm not mistaken

35
00:01:10.533 --> 00:01:12.766
Your second brother is already dead

36
00:01:12.766 --> 00:01:14.700
You are also in danger now

37
00:01:14.966 --> 00:01:17.733
After all, in a rebel army

38
00:01:17.733 --> 00:01:20.566
Only one person needs to have a say

39
00:01:21.333 --> 00:01:24.266
Ouch, I think you were frightened by temptation.

40
00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.233
Everyone looks like a bad guy

41
00:01:27.933 --> 00:01:30.800
You can rest here. I'm leaving
