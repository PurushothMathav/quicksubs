00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:05.433
Zicheng has never been flooded in a hundred years

2
00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:07.666
Could it be that the thieves used some strategy?

3
00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:08.800
You have to.

4
00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.266
Not good, not good

5
00:00:10.266 --> 00:00:11.366
Fuzhou river backflow

6
00:00:11.366 --> 00:00:12.966
Is there standing water in the city?

7
00:00:12.966 --> 00:00:13.866
What!

8
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.200
What can be done?

9
00:00:16.533 --> 00:00:18.033
Anyway, there's still time.

10
00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:19.400
We take the initiative

11
00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:20.500
Attack the Union Army

12
00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.233
This princess has already inquired

13
00:00:22.366 --> 00:00:23.966
The rebels are now setting up horses everywhere

14
00:00:23.966 --> 00:00:25.466
We're ready to move forward.

15
00:00:26.133 --> 00:00:27.866
The reckless lose.

16
00:00:27.866 --> 00:00:29.866
Oops, it's over, it's over, it's over

17
00:00:29.866 --> 00:00:31.666
If you go on like this, you will kill the city.

18
00:00:31.866 --> 00:00:33.333
If you don't attack, you will break

19
00:00:33.333 --> 00:00:33.966
Mr. Guo

20
00:00:33.966 --> 00:00:35.966
Catch a thing to be perfect and useless

21
00:00:35.966 --> 00:00:38.000
In addition to slapping horses, they will eat, drink and have fun

22
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.800
What about the two trash?

23
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:50.300
That's it.

24
00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.700
The soil is already full of water

25
00:00:53.366 --> 00:00:55.166
One will be successful

26
00:00:55.966 --> 00:00:59.100
I don't know how many people will be buried here this time

27
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.766
One drink and one turbid has its own number

28
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.766
Rakshasa Kingdom is also unbreakable

29
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.733
There's no need to look any further.

30
00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:07.966
Oops, it's all here

31
00:01:07.966 --> 00:01:09.900
It's boring not to leave something behind.

32
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.100
What do you intend to do?

33
00:01:11.166 --> 00:01:12.333
Don't you forget

34
00:01:12.333 --> 00:01:14.300
You can't just use the law now

35
00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:15.266
Nothing to do with the law

36
00:01:15.266 --> 00:01:16.433
Just keep a shareholder

37
00:01:16.533 --> 00:01:18.500
I hope to save a few more innocent people

38
00:01:19.466 --> 00:01:21.000
Choose you and leave us some flooding
