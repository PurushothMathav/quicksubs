00:00:02.366 --> 00:00:05.266
The rebel army turned out to be such a rebel army

2
00:00:05.566 --> 00:00:07.366
I misread you

3
00:00:07.366 --> 00:00:10.166
Hahaha, the winner and the loser

4
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.400
It's too late to say anything

5
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:17.066
One day either you or I will die

6
00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:24.500
I really admire you.

7
00:00:24.866 --> 00:00:26.100
Oh baby

8
00:00:26.166 --> 00:00:27.400
How do you want to solve it?

9
00:00:27.733 --> 00:00:29.800
He deserves the punishment he deserves.

10
00:00:32.266 --> 00:00:33.866
I'll do it myself

11
00:00:35.466 --> 00:00:38.266
Brothers, what is our slogan?

12
00:00:38.466 --> 00:00:40.366
Fight for equal freedom

13
00:00:40.366 --> 00:00:42.100
What are our house rules?

14
00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.066
First, absolute trust, assured partner.

15
00:00:45.066 --> 00:00:47.333
Second, never deceive or hurt a partner

16
00:00:47.333 --> 00:00:50.300
Third, never betray a partner

17
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:51.666
Very good.

18
00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:54.266
The three railways of our rebel army are absolute

19
00:00:54.266 --> 00:00:55.533
There's no question about it.

20
00:00:55.533 --> 00:00:57.433
And our predecessor, Datong Li

21
00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:00.866
Betray me for my own selfish desires

22
00:01:00.966 --> 00:01:03.566
Also killed the double gift

23
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.633
What are you saying we're going to do to him?

24
00:01:06.666 --> 00:01:08.366
Sorry, confident.

25
00:01:08.533 --> 00:01:10.966
Sorry, so confident.

26
00:01:11.333 --> 00:01:14.833
Today I will let him die at my second brother's grave
