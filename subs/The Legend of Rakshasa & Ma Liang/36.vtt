00:00:02.166 --> 00:00:03.366
Of course you will lose.

2
00:00:03.366 --> 00:00:07.066
Because Ma Liang has always been on my side

3
00:00:08.966 --> 00:00:10.400
Princess, I'm done.

4
00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:11.800
It's time for you to keep your promise

5
00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:13.800
I'm taking my brother and Sophie out of here with me

6
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:14.900
I see

7
00:00:15.566 --> 00:00:18.400
I don't know when Ma Liang betrayed me

8
00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:19.500
His Majesty the Emperor

9
00:00:19.666 --> 00:00:22.700
Ma Liang never promised you anything from start to finish

10
00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:23.733
How could you betray?

11
00:00:23.733 --> 00:00:25.000
I see

12
00:00:25.666 --> 00:00:28.433
It was when the young birds were plotting against the sloppy general

13
00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.633
It's all planned

14
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.233
Someone take it down

15
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:35.900
Humph

16
00:00:39.733 --> 00:00:41.500
Princess, it's all done

17
00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.366
Almost keep the promise, no problem

18
00:00:43.366 --> 00:00:45.066
You can leave the Rakshasa Kingdom

19
00:00:45.766 --> 00:00:47.433
If I remember correctly

20
00:00:47.466 --> 00:00:49.500
I said when it's done

21
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.766
I must take my brother and Sophie away with me

22
00:00:51.766 --> 00:00:53.233
Don't push your luck.

23
00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.066
If you don't want to go

24
00:00:55.066 --> 00:00:56.366
Can not leave

25
00:00:56.366 --> 00:00:59.466
Forever that's nothing to talk about

26
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:00.733
Even if I default

27
00:01:00.733 --> 00:01:02.233
What can you do to me?

28
00:01:02.366 --> 00:01:03.500
I took the pencil.

29
00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.266
What is the difference between you and ordinary people?

30
00:01:05.366 --> 00:01:06.400
Guess what?

31
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.066
Why did I leave alone just now?

32
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.800
I didn't want to do it here

33
00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.366
But don't make me

34
00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:14.866
Then you try it.

35
00:01:19.933 --> 00:01:22.066
Zofie, what do you mean?
