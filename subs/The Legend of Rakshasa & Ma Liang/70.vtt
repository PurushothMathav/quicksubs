00:00:02.266 --> 00:00:03.200
Valkyrie is above

2
00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:04.266
Soul Blessing Commander

3
00:00:04.266 --> 00:00:05.200
Destiny is on the left

4
00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:06.466
Break through the enemy

5
00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:12.333
Brothers, the outcome is decided

6
00:00:12.333 --> 00:00:13.500
It's man-made

7
00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:16.066
Let's build a bright world together with me

8
00:00:16.066 --> 00:00:18.800
Spell a bright universe Spell a bright universe

9
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.500
What about cutting down a tree?

10
00:00:20.566 --> 00:00:23.500
Princess, this rainy day is so annoying.

11
00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:25.566
There's no way to go out and find the street

12
00:00:25.666 --> 00:00:26.600
Xunjie

13
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:28.500
Can't go out

14
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.600
Eating, drinking and having fun is the point

15
00:00:31.766 --> 00:00:33.766
The princess joked

16
00:00:33.766 --> 00:00:35.133
The end will play into a room

17
00:00:35.133 --> 00:00:36.833
How dare you be distracted

18
00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:38.300
It better be.

19
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.733
If you let me know you're cheating

20
00:00:40.733 --> 00:00:43.566
This princess will surely let you die without a whole body

21
00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.300
Oh no, we're in big trouble

22
00:00:46.333 --> 00:00:48.266
What's the situation?

23
00:00:50.666 --> 00:00:52.966
Today I have nothing to do to inspect the provincial housing

24
00:00:52.966 --> 00:00:55.200
And the water level in the moat has gone up.

25
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.600
Heavy rain in Banchi every day

26
00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.366
Rising water levels in the moat are normal

27
00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:01.800
I already knew this was the case

28
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.066
It's not a normal increase.

29
00:01:03.766 --> 00:01:04.933
Floating city drainage excellent

30
00:01:04.933 --> 00:01:06.400
The water will never accumulate for more than two days

31
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.366
It has now risen for three consecutive days

32
00:01:08.366 --> 00:01:09.166
What!

33
00:01:09.966 --> 00:01:12.000
Come and see what's going on
