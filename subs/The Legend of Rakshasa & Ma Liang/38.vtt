00:00:03.366 --> 00:00:04.833
I'm not dead yet.

2
00:00:04.933 --> 00:00:06.666
I was going to die

3
00:00:06.866 --> 00:00:09.733
But who asked the imperial teacher to suddenly send a message to tell me to stay alive?

4
00:00:09.733 --> 00:00:12.266
The imperial master left me alive

5
00:00:12.266 --> 00:00:13.366
Haha, that's right.

6
00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:15.166
I can only say you are lucky.

7
00:00:15.166 --> 00:00:17.233
From the same place as the imperial teacher

8
00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:18.366
Maybe.

9
00:00:18.366 --> 00:00:21.300
After a thousand years, the imperial teacher is a little homesick, right?

10
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.500
Can you make a place like Rakshasa?

11
00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:26.466
Presumably not an orthodox person

12
00:00:26.466 --> 00:00:28.133
I suggest you say less

13
00:00:28.133 --> 00:00:29.833
The strength of the imperial teacher is supreme

14
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.900
You keep talking like that

15
00:00:31.933 --> 00:00:33.166
The imperial master may have heard it

16
00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:34.766
Yeah, so what?

17
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.600
If you really want to fight

18
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.233
I'm not necessarily afraid

19
00:00:38.366 --> 00:00:40.200
Your inexplicable confidence

20
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.933
I really don't understand a bit

21
00:00:41.933 --> 00:00:43.333
I see you are fine

22
00:00:43.333 --> 00:00:45.966
Get up, the doctor wants to see you, don't worry

23
00:00:45.966 --> 00:00:49.300
I can't die, it's not that I want to see me

24
00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:50.100
Humph

25
00:00:50.166 --> 00:00:53.400
Think with your toes and you know there's nothing else going on

26
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.100
Whatever you want.

27
00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.000
But this trip is certain

28
00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.900
Otherwise, I don't want your life either

29
00:01:00.366 --> 00:01:02.966
I am now a distinguished guest of the National Teacher

30
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.366
What's your attitude?

31
00:01:04.533 --> 00:01:06.433
Hahaha

32
00:01:06.466 --> 00:01:09.966
VIP, if you were honest

33
00:01:09.966 --> 00:01:11.666
Might be a guest

34
00:01:11.733 --> 00:01:13.833
You dare to play tricks on me

35
00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:15.400
Humph

36
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.133
Come in Sophie

37
00:01:18.133 --> 00:01:21.266
Take good care of your guest dad

38
00:01:21.266 --> 00:01:22.533
Is there a bird that really has you?

39
00:01:22.533 --> 00:01:24.033
You win

40
00:01:27.466 --> 00:01:29.233
Adults please change clothes

41
00:01:34.766 --> 00:01:36.500
This imperial teacher

42
00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.566
Looks like I have to meet
