00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:03.600
So do you want to bring me one?

2
00:00:04.466 --> 00:00:06.100
I go to sophie

3
00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:07.300
What are you doing here?

4
00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:09.066
It's not like I should have left here. Why?

5
00:00:09.066 --> 00:00:10.166
Are you not happy?

6
00:00:10.766 --> 00:00:12.400
Is there something wrong with your brain?

7
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:13.800
I suggest you see a doctor.

8
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:14.966
I finally ran out like this

9
00:00:14.966 --> 00:00:16.200
You're running back now

10
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:17.000
What do you mean?

11
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Anyway, I am the third leader of the cavalry army

12
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:19.933
One more, not much.

13
00:00:19.933 --> 00:00:20.933
I'm a lot less

14
00:00:20.933 --> 00:00:22.800
Aren't there more and better options?

15
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.400
Can't you leave Rakshasa?

16
00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:25.633
With your strength and appearance

17
00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:27.166
Except for the Rakshasa Kingdom

18
00:00:27.166 --> 00:00:29.633
You can live a happier and more nourished life anywhere

19
00:00:30.333 --> 00:00:32.700
But there is no you outside the Rakshasa Kingdom.

20
00:00:35.533 --> 00:00:37.733
I think there is a lot of misunderstanding between us.

21
00:00:37.733 --> 00:00:39.833
Don't you want to clear up these misunderstandings with me?

22
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.200
Lift what?

23
00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:42.200
Lift you leave now

24
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.466
It's too late before it's discovered

25
00:00:44.566 --> 00:00:46.366
I was caught by a chick

26
00:00:46.366 --> 00:00:49.266
Oh my god, you're so happy you got caught

27
00:00:49.266 --> 00:00:50.666
Are you sure you're awake now?

28
00:00:50.666 --> 00:00:52.233
You are so annoying

29
00:00:52.333 --> 00:00:55.200
This foot is on me and I can go wherever I want

30
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.933
I just want to do something big with you

31
00:00:57.933 --> 00:01:01.033
Big business, that's the business of licking blood on the tip of the knife

32
00:01:01.133 --> 00:01:04.100
I'm not afraid if I accidentally lose my head

33
00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:06.366
I would have died

34
00:01:06.466 --> 00:01:08.166
You gave me a lot of time.

35
00:01:08.166 --> 00:01:09.766
It makes sense for me to use it on you.

36
00:01:09.766 --> 00:01:11.666
You are reasonable, I don't want to?

37
00:01:11.666 --> 00:01:12.600
Don't you understand?

38
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.166
In my eyes, you are a drag

39
00:01:15.166 --> 00:01:17.333
I don't want to take care of a huge baby like you

40
00:01:17.333 --> 00:01:18.800
What are you?

41
00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.733
Do you have the brain to think about it?

42
00:01:20.733 --> 00:01:22.766
What else can you do but be impulsive and reckless?

43
00:01:22.766 --> 00:01:24.500
Do you know what Chaotao calculation is?

44
00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.333
I won't take you to do anything

45
00:01:26.333 --> 00:01:29.100
If you leave now, pretend I haven't seen you, Ma Liang

46
00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.566
You are going too far.
