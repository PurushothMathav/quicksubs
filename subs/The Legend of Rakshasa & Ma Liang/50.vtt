1
00:00:02.566 --> 00:00:03.900
Just so long

2
00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:06.600
We can drive straight in and take Shucheng

3
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:07.500
In this way

4
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.300
We will no longer be rootless duckweed

5
00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:11.900
They have the strength to fight the long game.

6
00:00:12.133 --> 00:00:13.600
That's a good suggestion

7
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:14.933
But I was thinking

8
00:00:14.933 --> 00:00:16.833
This Shucheng is difficult to attack

9
00:00:16.866 --> 00:00:18.000
heavily defended

10
00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.733
Our north and south armies are only 100,000 people

11
00:00:20.733 --> 00:00:22.700
How to chew this hard bone

12
00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:24.166
Since I dare to come today

13
00:00:24.166 --> 00:00:25.766
Nature is fully prepared

14
00:00:26.733 --> 00:00:27.766
You see here

15
00:00:28.133 --> 00:00:30.266
Here and here.

16
00:00:30.266 --> 00:00:31.900
This looks on the map

17
00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:33.166
There's no connection.

18
00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:34.000
Exactly.

19
00:00:34.333 --> 00:00:37.000
But that's just what you think.

20
00:00:37.066 --> 00:00:39.400
In fact, in our southern insurgent services

21
00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:42.500
There are a group of elderly people who have participated in the construction of the bookstore

22
00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:43.833
They told me

23
00:00:43.966 --> 00:00:45.766
There is a secret passage under the bookstore

24
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.566
It's full of explosives

25
00:00:47.733 --> 00:00:49.233
Just ignite the explosives

26
00:00:49.266 --> 00:00:51.000
You can blow up the whole city

27
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.700
There are bombs under the city

28
00:00:54.333 --> 00:00:55.666
That's too unreasonable.

29
00:00:55.666 --> 00:00:57.466
If my guess is correct

30
00:00:57.466 --> 00:01:00.066
It should be that the book will be left in order to perish together

31
00:01:00.066 --> 00:01:01.900
Mr. Ma Lian is really amazing

32
00:01:02.133 --> 00:01:05.066
That's right, this is the defenders' Tamsui plan

33
00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:06.600
As long as the city gate is forced

34
00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:08.566
The defenders will set off explosives

35
00:01:08.666 --> 00:01:11.266
Die with the engineering team

36
00:01:11.266 --> 00:01:13.100
Wouldn't that make it harder for us?

37
00:01:13.166 --> 00:01:14.800
The old man in the army told me

38
00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.866
This secret passage has a side door in the suburbs

39
00:01:17.866 --> 00:01:19.100
It's pretty remote.

40
00:01:19.166 --> 00:01:20.166
Unguarded

41
00:01:20.466 --> 00:01:22.733
As long as someone goes in and sets off explosives

42
00:01:22.733 --> 00:01:25.066
Then Shucheng will be at your fingertips

43
00:01:25.733 --> 00:01:26.966
That being the case

44
00:01:27.933 --> 00:01:28.533
Your Confederate Army

45
00:01:28.533 --> 00:01:30.433
Why do you still want to cooperate with our Northern Army?

46
00:01:30.533 --> 00:01:31.800
Ashamed to say

47
00:01:32.166 --> 00:01:35.033
Because this secret passage is for Yuhei to see

48
00:01:35.466 --> 00:01:36.866
Once the explosives are ignited

49
00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:38.766
The time to escape will be short

50
00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.133
You mean to let our Union army die

51
00:01:42.133 --> 00:01:43.366
I'll tell you what.
