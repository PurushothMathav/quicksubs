1
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.566
Rakshasa State is in a panic

2
00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:06.033
Reverse sky high

3
00:00:06.266 --> 00:00:07.366
The road is evil

4
00:00:07.666 --> 00:00:09.000
People sigh

5
00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.800
I'm Sophie here today.

6
00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:13.466
Willing to hold high the flag

7
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:15.400
Do the right thing for heaven

8
00:00:15.733 --> 00:00:18.200
Stand up for a bright world

9
00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.633
Return heaven and earth to a dynasty, sun and moon

10
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:22.900
war war

11
00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:24.233
Brothers

12
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:25.600
Revelation

13
00:00:26.733 --> 00:00:27.833
Repair my armor

14
00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.066
Tread the Rakshasa

15
00:00:29.366 --> 00:00:30.666
Punish me for blood

16
00:00:30.733 --> 00:00:32.066
Keep going

17
00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:33.400
Wine my armor

18
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.000
Tread the grinding brake

19
00:00:35.266 --> 00:00:36.600
Give me blood

20
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.000
Keep going

21
00:00:40.166 --> 00:00:42.766
Liu Niang, what do you think?

22
00:00:42.766 --> 00:00:44.966
The rabble is embarrassed

23
00:00:44.966 --> 00:00:47.466
How could it possibly shake the millennial foundation of my Raksha Kingdom?

24
00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.300
What a rabble

25
00:00:52.466 --> 00:00:55.666
Then I speak the dialect of the North County of Rakshasa for hundreds of miles

26
00:00:55.966 --> 00:00:58.066
Why were they taken away?

27
00:00:58.066 --> 00:00:59.033
I am incompetent

28
00:00:59.333 --> 00:01:00.866
Ask the imperial teacher to give me another chance

29
00:01:00.866 --> 00:01:04.200
Opportunities are earned by yourself

30
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:05.166
Youniang

31
00:01:05.933 --> 00:01:09.100
How long have you been practicing with me?

32
00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:10.800
Returning home has been 10 years

33
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:14.833
33 years hahaha

34
00:01:15.966 --> 00:01:16.766
OK

35
00:01:17.666 --> 00:01:20.100
Don't blame your country for not giving you a chance

36
00:01:20.266 --> 00:01:22.433
I'll 100,000 you

37
00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.100
To defend Hucheng for 13 days

38
00:01:25.166 --> 00:01:26.966
Possibly do

39
00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:29.000
The city is here

40
00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.300
City destruction
