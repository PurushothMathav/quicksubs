00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:05.430
Ism, for people like you who remember,

2
00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:07.350
Be responsible for the clothes you wear throughout your life,

3
00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:09.390
Neither of them is noble, you know?

4
00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:11.070
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,

5
00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:13.480
I really am no longer a negative person.

6
00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:15.910
Will it be resolved if you go and apologize?

7
00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:17.810
You and the others have to accompany you on this kind of thing.

8
00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:22.300
How much does this kind of companionship cost? I donâ€™t have the resources,

9
00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:25.780
Just pay the original price, this is an international residence.

10
00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.050
Give me one hundred thousand? What?

11
00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:31.730
For ten thousand, I can make you spend a lot of money on wasted trade.

12
00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:35.010
What? Are you still thinking about it?

13
00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.850
Young and healthy

14
00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:41.140
There are so many in my wolf

15
00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.440
Where did you talk about it at that time?

16
00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:47.860
I'll give you a clean death

17
00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:50.940
Let me just forget about it.

18
00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:01.600
I'll beat you to death
