00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:02.360
This is not,

2
00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:06.060
You know better than me, please tell me,

3
00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:08.830
Donâ€™t those investors explain it better than you?

4
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.900
It must have been a risk, so it was worth the money.

5
00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:14.320
Of course the union is our family, they least believe it,

6
00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:16.180
But you can't think this way.

7
00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:21.200

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:27.890

11
00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:37.410
Everyone has to sing at the top

12
00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.600
I want to accompany you and help you hear your life plans

13
00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.240
First, so many companies were directly transferred out.

14
00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:55.120
He is quite drunk now

15
00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:56.800
