00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:07.040
We voters, if you are like this, what do we call this?

2
00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:11.490
Dad, do you want me to explain?

3
00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:15.990
What do you explain? Did I see the bed on the window yesterday?

4
00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:19.590
Today's step makes me more voters,

5
00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.330
Do you see my death?

6
00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:27.400
Dad, you really canâ€™t do it anymore,

7
00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.720
This is my cousin, what are we talking about?

8
00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.160
This is how we discussed things with the table.

9
00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.030
Why don't you go explain it to me?

10
00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:42.640
Why are you looking for death?

11
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.180
Since I'm being watched by you today

12
00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:00.560
That's what you see

13
00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:06.150
Anyway, their home has little use value.
