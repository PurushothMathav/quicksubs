00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:06.560
Don't think of yourself as a child.

2
00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:08.360
Is that what everyone said?

3
00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:11.240
You still have to let him worry about you all day long.

4
00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:20.610
He also thought it was too much for him to have nothing to do for a whole day.

5
00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:22.580
Talk about warmth, husband.

6
00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:24.980
You said if I didn't take care of him anymore.

7
00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.400
I also have to go out to work, but now I can do it.

8
00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:33.570
You're still angry at me.

9
00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.680
Negotiate, discuss, discuss this time, but you go to forty,

10
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.180
Nonsense.

11
00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.820
Dad, don't be angry,

12
00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.980
It's hard to take care of you

13
00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:45.710
Is there anything he didn't do well?

14
00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:49.980
don't you believe me

15
00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:55.330
Shouldn't I say a few words?
