00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:15.970
how's it going?

2
00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:18.910
How much will it cost this time?

3
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.040
How much is it this time? How much is it this time? How much is it this time?

4
00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:24.520
What do you want to buy? Letâ€™s go buy, buy, buy,

5
00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:27.550
You know if you can buy it with this money,

6
00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:29.480
Leave it to the house outside my shop.

7
00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:32.159
What? Buy a house?

8
00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:33.720
This money can be taken away from the land.

9
00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.330
People who will die when their bodies are lifted,

10
00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:42.130
If the quality is good, what's the use?

11
00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:44.430
I can handle this money.

12
00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.110
Take this and remember to buy a house for you.

13
00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:49.740
This isn't appropriate.

14
00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:51.460
There is no way to live like this,

15
00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:53.500
Let you get some money, the opportunity is extremely unexpected.

16
00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:58.650
When we get married, I will use mine to help you buy a house.

17
00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:02.300
Now you want to use my money to buy a house for your brother

18
00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:06.800
Let us lock you up tomorrow
