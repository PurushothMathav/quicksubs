00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:03.050
I just came from abroad,

2
00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:06.040
Are you really ready to leave?

3
00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:08.820
We are called Morality, and I would like to say that we are about to get off work.

4
00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:15.750
Yes, forget it if there is still more at my station. I won’t be able to eat if it’s empty next time.

5
00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:20.400
The two of them wanted to pass the test and asked for proof.

6
00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:31.580
I won't excuse you if I say it. If you are free, just take my family to play.

7
00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:36.520
What I heard was great, and I called my family to play it all the time.

8
00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.740
Listen, talk, and then I listen to what is said.

9
00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:56.330
One day I found a provincial friend in Israel

10
00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.330
All the touching breaths
