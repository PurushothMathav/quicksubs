00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:04.360
What's your condition? Okay, what if you don't want to die as long as you are not born?

2
00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:06.720
You just want the moon to be on the upper side, and I have to go with you.

3
00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.690
This is what you promised me. I will buy a house first.

4
00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:18.170
There's still 600,000 left, why are you looking for your sister?

5
00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:20.420
Look at you, what kind of monster are you today?

6
00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.870
Isn’t it just 600,000? For a company as big as your sister’s,

7
00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:26.930
If you ask, he won't refuse to give it to you.

8
00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:30.390
With so much money, how could we open our mouths?

9
00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.479
Besides, it wasn’t just told to me yesterday.

10
00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:35.030
I asked you to borrow it

11
00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:37.470
Isn't it right to give him leniency?

12
00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:39.430
But I am no longer in history now

13
00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:42.750
This is how I tell him

14
00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.870
Otherwise, wouldn't it be better?

15
00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:47.170
You go to finance and slide the money out

16
00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:48.850
Wait until he returns home

17
00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:51.850
Can this be considered a thing?

18
00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:58.880
How about letting him come back?

19
00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.480
You just wrote a letter and said it was practical.
