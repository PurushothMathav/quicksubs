Haven't you come back yet?

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:05.400
Going out in the morning?

3
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.000
So you haven't eaten yet?

4
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.640
Are you going to cook alone?

5
00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:10.360
I've had takeout.

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:11.940
Right? Want to eat?

7
00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:13.820

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:33.940
Want to eat? Want

16
00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:37.340
Don't think that we are active

17
00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:47.040
Is this the word?

18
00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.100
By the way, wife

19
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.820
Not the horse race I was talking about last night

20
00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:02.850
Been busy all day today
