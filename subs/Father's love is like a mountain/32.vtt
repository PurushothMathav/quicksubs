Do you believe it? Where are these people eating?

2
00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:36.330
I don't. You haven't eaten since yesterday afternoon,

3
00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:39.720
Why don't you get up and eat something?

4
00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:41.680
Of course I'm tired of talking and hearing your voice.

5
00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:49.640
Come and go, you'll have to get up and eat later.

6
00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:52.300
Yes, or should the teachers go?

7
00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.390
In the past, I couldn’t get through without being able to use the Internet.

8
00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.840
Come and go, I will feel that should or should be available to you.

9
00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:01.550
would think I found your team,

10
00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:04.769
Come in yesterday and don't go there too much,

11
00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.340
If you want to figure it out, let’s talk about character. Everyone needs to go out.

12
00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:10.480
I went to find this shareholder and see what it meant.

13
00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.900
