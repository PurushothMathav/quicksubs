00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:02.033
Let me go

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.366
500,000 enough

3
00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:07.600
1 million 2 million

4
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.166
5 million if it was someone else

5
00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:12.700
I might say yes.

6
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.166
Absolutely impossible if it were you

7
00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.600
Everyone can do it, but you can't.

8
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.233
Did you forget

9
00:00:26.166 --> 00:00:28.400
What do you have against me?

10
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.066
I beg you not to hurt her. Please don't

11
00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.500
That's how you look at people.

12
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.400
I beg you.

13
00:00:44.333 --> 00:00:46.733
I beg you not to hurt my brother

14
00:00:46.733 --> 00:00:48.433
I only have him

15
00:00:50.166 --> 00:00:53.233
You want me to let your brother go, but

16
00:00:55.366 --> 00:00:56.633
Be obedient

17
00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:59.433
Be my stand-in hero

18
00:01:11.766 --> 00:01:12.566
miss

19
00:01:13.166 --> 00:01:15.433
No, Brother Chen, it's really you

20
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.766
Is your injury better?

21
00:01:17.766 --> 00:01:19.566
I'm fine. I'm fine.

22
00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:21.466
The key is you

23
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.500
I just watched the news.

24
00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.366
I heard you are Guo Yiming's secretary

25
00:01:27.666 --> 00:01:30.066
He didn't bully you, did he?

26
00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:39.100
In 10 minutes.

27
00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:40.900
I want to see your people

28
00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:42.300
But I am now

29
00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:46.800
Brother Muchen, I'm sorry.

30
00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:48.500
I have to go first
