00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.366
Hey, sister, is this coffee shop good?

2
00:00:02.466 --> 00:00:04.766
That depends, of course, on who I bring.

3
00:00:04.766 --> 00:00:06.300
Brother Muchen, why are you here?

4
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:08.066
I met him when I was at the mall

5
00:00:08.066 --> 00:00:09.100
You don't know yet

6
00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:12.000
Your brother Muchen is the largest shareholder of this store

7
00:00:12.466 --> 00:00:14.700
Brother Muchen, we haven't finished packing yet.

8
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:15.766
Do you mind?

9
00:00:15.766 --> 00:00:17.366
It's okay to go

10
00:00:17.366 --> 00:00:19.266
Go, Brother Muchen

11
00:00:19.466 --> 00:00:21.666
Thank you for your care and help in the past.

12
00:00:21.666 --> 00:00:23.966
You don't have to be so polite to me

13
00:00:23.966 --> 00:00:24.766
Right.

14
00:00:24.766 --> 00:00:27.766
Maybe Brother Muchen will still be my brother-in-law in the future

15
00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.233
What do you think?

16
00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:30.900
Hey this kid

17
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.900
Sister, don't always mess with me, I've grown up

18
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:35.133
What am I saying?

19
00:00:35.133 --> 00:00:37.266
Nian Nian is actually me, oh right

20
00:00:37.266 --> 00:00:39.966
Brother Mu Chen, this is my newly developed coffee

21
00:00:39.966 --> 00:00:41.100
Would you like to try it?

22
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:43.933
It looks good.

23
00:00:43.933 --> 00:00:44.866
Bro um

24
00:00:44.866 --> 00:00:47.233
You are here every day now.

25
00:00:47.533 --> 00:00:48.433
Too Tomorrow

26
00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.833
I have nothing to do with him anymore

27
00:00:50.866 --> 00:00:53.433
He won't bother me anymore, that's fine

28
00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.866
Brother Muchen will come again next time he has a chance.

29
00:00:58.866 --> 00:00:59.666
OK

30
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.833
Hey sister

31
00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:03.500
You know.

32
00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.266
I've been paying attention

33
00:01:05.766 --> 00:01:08.300
Now that everything has started all over again

34
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.000
Then can you give me another chance to be my girlfriend?

35
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Brother Muchen

36
00:01:13.666 --> 00:01:15.866
Everything in the past is in the past

37
00:01:15.866 --> 00:01:17.600
You always have to start a new life
