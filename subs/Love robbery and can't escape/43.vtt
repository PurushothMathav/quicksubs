00:00:20.366 --> 00:00:22.566
I told you not to drink and drive

2
00:00:22.566 --> 00:00:23.800
Don't drink and drive

3
00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:24.966
You just wouldn't listen?

4
00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:26.066
It's all right now.

5
00:00:26.066 --> 00:00:27.766
Killing

6
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.500
Not crying is a pain

7
00:00:31.533 --> 00:00:32.966
If you fail financially

8
00:00:32.966 --> 00:00:35.066
What should I do with the army?

9
00:00:35.133 --> 00:00:37.266
Don't worry about it

10
00:00:37.266 --> 00:00:38.533
I have already prayed

11
00:00:38.533 --> 00:00:40.300
What about the hospital certificate?

12
00:00:53.533 --> 00:00:56.466
Why are you crying here alone?

13
00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:58.500
I don't have a mother.

14
00:00:58.966 --> 00:00:59.933
And my dad said

15
00:00:59.933 --> 00:01:03.333
After death, people become stars in the sky

16
00:01:03.333 --> 00:01:05.533
Protect the people you love the most

17
00:01:05.533 --> 00:01:07.866
So you won't be without a mother.

18
00:01:07.866 --> 00:01:10.100
He will always be with you

19
00:01:11.333 --> 00:01:13.500
Really? Of course it's true.

20
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.966
This is what my mom bought for me

21
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.600
She said she would be lucky to wear it

22
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.066
Now I'll give you half of it.

23
00:01:21.066 --> 00:01:24.466
If you are lucky, don't cry alone

24
00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.966
Thank you. You're welcome.

25
00:01:31.533 --> 00:01:32.700
Whose is this?

26
00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:36.866
Say whose it is mine
