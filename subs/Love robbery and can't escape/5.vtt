00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:03.000
You said wait until I become Mrs. Gu

2
00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:04.566
Maybe I can give you a little

3
00:00:04.733 --> 00:00:08.500
I heard the news that you are Mrs. Gu

4
00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:10.266
To be mine too

5
00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:12.200
You are so ugly that Gu can always look up to you

6
00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:16.466
You give me you let go of me let go

7
00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:23.700
It smells like wine.

8
00:00:24.133 --> 00:00:25.966
Did you go to the wrong room?

9
00:00:31.766 --> 00:00:32.900
Play hard to get

10
00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:34.500
Enough wine

11
00:00:35.366 --> 00:00:37.900
Take the initiative and I'll give you more.

12
00:00:40.466 --> 00:00:41.400
Mr. Gu, you misunderstood.

13
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:42.766
I'm here to pay you back

14
00:00:49.866 --> 00:00:51.833
More and more interesting

15
00:00:52.566 --> 00:00:54.866
Could it be that I really misunderstood him?

16
00:00:59.766 --> 00:01:00.633
Li Nian

17
00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:03.166
How can you drop the chain at a critical moment?

18
00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.833
It will be difficult to approach him next time.

19
00:01:08.966 --> 00:01:11.666
How are you doing today?

20
00:01:11.666 --> 00:01:13.600
I'm much better, don't worry.

21
00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.800
Don't come here if you get off work so late every day

22
00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.100
I can do it myself.

23
00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:18.800
It's okay to sleep here

24
00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.033
I sleep in peace, sister

25
00:01:21.133 --> 00:01:22.400
The doctor said

26
00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.133
That imported medicine is too expensive.

27
00:01:24.133 --> 00:01:27.133
Why don't we change it to something ordinary? It's alright.

28
00:01:27.133 --> 00:01:28.366
If it is more expensive, it will be more expensive.

29
00:01:28.366 --> 00:01:29.566
As long as the effect is good

30
00:01:29.766 --> 00:01:30.566
sister

31
00:01:30.966 --> 00:01:33.066
What kind of job did you find?

32
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.333
You don't have to worry about that.

33
00:01:36.333 --> 00:01:37.800
Just rest well.

34
00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:42.700
Have to look for it again

35
00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:43.500
Gu Yiming

36
00:01:43.933 --> 00:01:45.500
Don't back down this time
