00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:01.166
I told you

2
00:00:01.166 --> 00:00:02.333
Don't drink and drive

3
00:00:02.333 --> 00:00:03.566
Don't drink and drive

4
00:00:03.566 --> 00:00:04.866
You just wouldn't listen?

5
00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:05.800
It's all right now.

6
00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:07.466
Killing

7
00:00:08.266 --> 00:00:10.400
If you cry, you will know to cry

8
00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:12.733
If you go to jail

9
00:00:12.733 --> 00:00:14.900
What will my parents and I do in the future?

10
00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:16.966
Don't worry about it

11
00:00:16.966 --> 00:00:19.966
I'm halfway there. What about the hospital?

12
00:00:19.966 --> 00:00:22.266
The hospital has already done it.

13
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:23.566
This matter begins with

14
00:00:23.933 --> 00:00:25.266
Don't mention it again

15
00:00:27.866 --> 00:00:30.100
Really ulterior motives?

16
00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:33.800
Brother Lin, you are really indistinguishable

17
00:00:34.866 --> 00:00:37.633
But your ex-daughter delivered it to your door by herself

18
00:00:39.066 --> 00:00:41.200
Then don't blame me for being polite

19
00:00:43.766 --> 00:00:44.900
Ah brother

20
00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:46.433
What are you sitting up for?

21
00:00:46.866 --> 00:00:49.366
The doctor said you need to lie down and get some rest

22
00:00:53.766 --> 00:00:55.733
What did it do to you?

23
00:00:55.733 --> 00:00:58.033
Why are you still reading about that bitch?

24
00:00:58.366 --> 00:01:01.500
Brother, do you know what he is doing now?

25
00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.400
He's working as an escort

26
00:01:04.133 --> 00:01:05.066
heard

27
00:01:05.066 --> 00:01:07.633
He has already hooked up with Mr. Gu of Story Group

28
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.566
Maybe where are you still having a good time?

29
00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:15.900
You send me WeChat.
