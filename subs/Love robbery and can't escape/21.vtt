00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:01.166
Movie fan

2
00:00:03.666 --> 00:00:06.500
Why are you such a fan?

3
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:07.800
Mr. Gu has something to do when he goes out

4
00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.433
Please wait here.

5
00:00:10.466 --> 00:00:12.300
Then pour me a cup of tea

6
00:00:23.866 --> 00:00:25.200
Can you make tea?

7
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.200
Soak me in the freshly boiled water

8
00:00:34.666 --> 00:00:35.466
Ah!

9
00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.033
You bitch is going to burn me to death, right?

10
00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:43.166
Li Ming, you are finally here.

11
00:00:44.266 --> 00:00:45.200
How come?

12
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.666
I just asked him to pour me a cup of tea

13
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.200
Who knew he couldn't even hold a cup?

14
00:00:51.166 --> 00:00:51.966
Ah!

15
00:00:52.533 --> 00:00:53.666
Is that so?

16
00:00:53.966 --> 00:00:54.733
Of course it is.

17
00:00:54.733 --> 00:00:57.300
Li Ming is a hairy person like this

18
00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.133
Don't stay by your side

19
00:00:59.133 --> 00:01:00.600
Fortunately, today is me

20
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:01.700
If it were someone else

21
00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:03.200
It's not good if it affects the company

22
00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.866
I keep him around for the time being

23
00:01:06.133 --> 00:01:07.766
If you want to hire someone, just tell me.

24
00:01:07.766 --> 00:01:09.200
I'll ask my dad to arrange it for you.

25
00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.066
Will be much more useful than him

26
00:01:11.333 --> 00:01:12.300
Okay.

27
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.900
Why did you come to see me today?

28
00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:16.733
My father in a previous life

29
00:01:16.733 --> 00:01:19.800
He said that sooner or later we would manage the family business together

30
00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.233
Why don't I come and learn from you now?

31
00:01:22.266 --> 00:01:24.633
Do you know that he is relieved again?

32
00:01:26.166 --> 00:01:27.666
I'll ask Fang Qun to arrange it for you.

33
00:01:27.666 --> 00:01:28.700
Then let's go eat.

34
00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.733
I recently discovered a particularly delicious restaurant

35
00:01:30.733 --> 00:01:31.533
Come on.

36
00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.000
Secretary Li

37
00:01:37.066 --> 00:01:38.200
This is scalding medicine

38
00:01:38.866 --> 00:01:41.066
Ah, thank you.

39
00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.000
You don't need to thank me.

40
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.666
This is Mr. Gu who asked me to send it to Mr. Gu
