00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:06.300
Can my mom let me talk to my brother?

2
00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:08.100
Sorry, Miss Lin.

3
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:10.666
Mr. Gu told you not to touch your phone

4
00:00:12.066 --> 00:00:15.066
I don't know when I'm going to be locked up like this

5
00:00:15.866 --> 00:00:18.600
No, I have to figure it out.

6
00:00:20.733 --> 00:00:23.200
Miss Lin, what are you doing?

7
00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:24.800
If you don't give me my phone

8
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.133
I'll die right here

9
00:00:26.133 --> 00:00:28.366
Oh, I really can't, Miss Lin.

10
00:00:28.466 --> 00:00:29.600
How do you know?

11
00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.333
That won't let me go

12
00:00:31.333 --> 00:00:32.766
But I know I am

13
00:00:32.766 --> 00:00:34.466
He won't let you go

14
00:00:42.366 --> 00:00:44.166
Hey, Mr. Gu, you are here

15
00:00:44.166 --> 00:00:45.200
Miss Lin is going to commit suicide

16
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.966
But it has nothing to do with me

17
00:00:46.966 --> 00:00:48.666
I see. Go on.

18
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.033
Wrong

19
00:00:52.766 --> 00:00:54.000
Come to the alley

20
00:00:55.666 --> 00:00:57.666
How long are you going to lock me up?

21
00:00:58.066 --> 00:01:00.166
I can lock up as long as I want

22
00:01:00.266 --> 00:01:01.733
As long as you are obedient

23
00:01:01.733 --> 00:01:03.266
I'll think about it.

24
00:01:03.266 --> 00:01:04.366
Watch me out

25
00:01:05.066 --> 00:01:07.300
You can take care of me anytime.

26
00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.200
But if you let me know something happened to my brother

27
00:01:10.333 --> 00:01:12.433
I won't let you go.
