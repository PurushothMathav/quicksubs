00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.066
Sister, you don't always think so, do you?

2
00:00:02.066 --> 00:00:04.266
Why is Mr. Gu so vicious when he doesn't call a car?

3
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:08.166
What makes you think that?

4
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.200
Look at him last time when I was sick

5
00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.500
Then let you look at me when you come to work

6
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.600
This time you were sick and he took you to the hospital

7
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.000
Also, when I had surgery

8
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.466
He got the best doctor in the country to do it for me

9
00:00:20.366 --> 00:00:21.866
Sister, say

10
00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:23.766
But I kind of like you.

11
00:00:23.866 --> 00:00:25.166
What are you talking about?

12
00:00:25.733 --> 00:00:28.300
Hasn't he been threatening me with my brother?

13
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:31.300
How could I possibly save my brother?

14
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:34.533
Anyway, sister

15
00:00:34.533 --> 00:00:36.833
We must repay this time

16
00:00:38.966 --> 00:00:41.000
Uh-huh.

17
00:00:42.266 --> 00:00:45.266
No, death can't know the truth yet

18
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.400
Sister-in-law, listen to your sister

19
00:00:51.733 --> 00:00:54.066
There is no shortage of defenses in this world.

20
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.066
Except me.

21
00:00:55.066 --> 00:00:57.300
Everyone has ulterior motives for your kindness

22
00:00:57.533 --> 00:00:58.566
Do you understand?

23
00:00:58.566 --> 00:00:59.933
OK. Do you understand?

24
00:00:59.933 --> 00:01:02.033
Okay, sister, don't get excited.

25
00:01:02.133 --> 00:01:03.066
Hey sister

26
00:01:03.533 --> 00:01:04.533
You take good care

27
00:01:04.533 --> 00:01:05.666
When you're well?

28
00:01:05.666 --> 00:01:07.466
We still hang out like we were kids

29
00:01:07.466 --> 00:01:08.900
Let's relax together, okay?

30
00:01:09.733 --> 00:01:11.866
Dead me now

31
00:01:12.333 --> 00:01:13.900
Only you.

32
00:01:14.166 --> 00:01:16.700
I can't lose you anymore

33
00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:18.900
I know, sis.

34
00:01:19.133 --> 00:01:20.366
You take good care

35
00:01:20.533 --> 00:01:22.866
Will we still be the same as before?

36
00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.300
How is the hospital these days?

37
00:01:26.533 --> 00:01:27.366
These days

38
00:01:27.366 --> 00:01:29.333
Lin Ziang goes to chat with Miss Lin every day

39
00:01:29.333 --> 00:01:31.166
Miss Lin's condition looks much better

40
00:01:31.166 --> 00:01:32.800
Make arrangements for tomorrow's departure

41
00:01:32.933 --> 00:01:33.966
We're not leaving with one hand

42
00:01:33.966 --> 00:01:36.066
The doctor said that Miss Lin should be respected

43
00:01:36.066 --> 00:01:38.233
He is afraid of heights now that he is going abroad

44
00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.766
Got it, tell someone to watch him

45
00:01:41.333 --> 00:01:42.133
Yes

46
00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:44.866
Changed my dressing today
