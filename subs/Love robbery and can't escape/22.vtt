00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:02.766
I heard that Miss Tang is about to join our company

2
00:00:02.766 --> 00:00:05.366
Yeah, I also saw Fonte's teaching assistant today

3
00:00:05.366 --> 00:00:07.500
People say it's a big office

4
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:08.000
Then let's

5
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.200
Do you have to hurry up and please the future boss lady?

6
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.300
Forget it, people don't like us either

7
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.466
But I guess there will be a good show to watch in the future

8
00:00:15.466 --> 00:00:18.200
You mean it's so dark with a secretary book?

9
00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.066
Became a secretary for no reason

10
00:00:20.066 --> 00:00:21.600
Who knows what was done?

11
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.566
Even if you hook up with Mr. Gu, it's useless

12
00:00:23.566 --> 00:00:25.733
Miss Cao will not let him go easily

13
00:00:25.733 --> 00:00:27.066
Let's make a bet

14
00:00:27.066 --> 00:00:29.233
How long has Secretary Cai Lin been kicked out of the company?

15
00:00:33.333 --> 00:00:35.900
You have to be strong inside

16
00:00:36.266 --> 00:00:38.300
You must persevere until Zi Ang recovers

17
00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.000
Brother Muchen, why are you looking for me?

18
00:00:44.866 --> 00:00:45.666
beautiful woman

19
00:00:45.866 --> 00:00:48.400
I'm still worried about you doing things for another summer vacation

20
00:00:48.733 --> 00:00:50.666
Why don't you come to the Holy Spirit Group?

21
00:00:50.666 --> 00:00:52.466
I will arrange a 7-seat bird plant for you.

22
00:00:53.466 --> 00:00:54.766
No need, Brother Muchen

23
00:00:54.866 --> 00:00:56.366
I'm doing pretty good.

24
00:00:57.266 --> 00:00:58.300
Yeah, it's fine.

25
00:00:58.866 --> 00:01:01.266
Then tell me what's going on.

26
00:01:01.333 --> 00:01:04.100
This is what I accidentally scalded by pouring water today.

27
00:01:05.266 --> 00:01:07.833
Hilarious you loved you very much

28
00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:11.233
But look at the box every day and night

29
00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:13.033
Isn't this Secretary Lin?

30
00:01:18.133 --> 00:01:22.166
Miss Lin is really getting better and better

31
00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:23.400
Guiming

32
00:01:24.066 --> 00:01:25.633
I advise you to read it for a day

33
00:01:26.566 --> 00:01:27.600
miss

34
00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.566
Hmph, it's so affectionate

35
00:01:31.866 --> 00:01:33.666
Hello big man

36
00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.966
You dare to touch my stuff

37
00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:37.466
Mr. Gu, I was wrong.

38
00:01:37.466 --> 00:01:38.666
I don't know him at all.

39
00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:40.366
Let's go!

40
00:01:41.366 --> 00:01:42.900
Let's go!

41
00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:46.500
I go
