00:00:00.966 --> 00:00:02.066
Kneel down for me

2
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.300
You keep your eyes open.

3
00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:06.666
Take a good look.

4
00:00:06.666 --> 00:00:08.300
I don't know this woman.

5
00:00:08.933 --> 00:00:10.100
do not know

6
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.166
Then you have to ask your good father.

7
00:00:13.166 --> 00:00:14.433
If not for him

8
00:00:14.766 --> 00:00:16.000
Killed my mother

9
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.533
How can I be laughed at by myself?

10
00:00:19.533 --> 00:00:21.000
Living like a beggar

11
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.833
No way my father is not like that

12
00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:25.766
There must be some misunderstanding

13
00:00:25.766 --> 00:00:28.466
Misunderstanding I heard it with my own ears

14
00:00:28.666 --> 00:00:30.733
He himself said that his drunk driving killed my mother

15
00:00:30.733 --> 00:00:32.233
Then spend money to settle

16
00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.466
You tell me now it's a misunderstanding.

17
00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:35.600
That's impossible.

18
00:00:36.266 --> 00:00:37.066
That's impossible.

19
00:00:37.566 --> 00:00:39.766
My father was not like that.

20
00:00:42.066 --> 00:00:44.200
Since Brother Lin is gone

21
00:00:44.366 --> 00:00:47.433
Then you have to pay him back in full

22
00:00:47.966 --> 00:00:48.866
No.

23
00:00:49.866 --> 00:00:50.966
No.

24
00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:53.633
You owe me for crossing your Lijiang

25
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.166
It can be offset with one life

26
00:00:56.766 --> 00:00:57.633
Hou Yiming

27
00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.200
Mr. Gu, why don't you commit suicide?

28
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.966
I took a good look at him

29
00:01:02.366 --> 00:01:03.866
Without my destiny

30
00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:05.200
Don't let him out

31
00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.466
Yeah, don't kneel here

32
00:01:08.866 --> 00:01:11.466
Good luck to repent slowly

33
00:01:11.766 --> 00:01:13.500
