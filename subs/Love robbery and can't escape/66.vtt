1
00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:01.966
You killed our baby, long live our baby

2
00:00:01.966 --> 00:00:03.400
I told him to help.

3
00:00:04.133 --> 00:00:06.666
My baby girl is being bullied

4
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.300
My grandson was also killed

5
00:00:09.766 --> 00:00:13.933
Now his father actually speaks for the murderer

6
00:00:13.933 --> 00:00:15.766
Why would you hire me like that?

7
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.033
Auntie child is gone

8
00:00:18.266 --> 00:00:19.400
I am also responsible

9
00:00:19.566 --> 00:00:21.266
My marriage to Tang Yuxin remains unchanged

10
00:00:21.266 --> 00:00:23.000
Leave the rest to me

11
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.566
Take them out to rest

12
00:00:25.566 --> 00:00:27.100
Let's get to know each other.

13
00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:34.000
Mr. Guo just thanked you, but listen to my explanation

14
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.666
I really didn't do it.

15
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.000
What happened that day?

16
00:00:39.466 --> 00:00:41.133
You tell me one by one

17
00:00:41.133 --> 00:00:43.366
I got a text the other day.

18
00:00:43.566 --> 00:00:46.133
Let me go to Xishan Road and say that something happened to Zi Ang

19
00:00:46.133 --> 00:00:48.300
But when I arrived, I didn't see anyone.

20
00:00:48.466 --> 00:00:50.266
Then suddenly Tang Yuxin appeared

21
00:00:50.266 --> 00:00:51.866
He said he was hurt

22
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.800
Then suddenly it fell backwards

23
00:00:54.933 --> 00:00:56.800
Son text message pair

24
00:00:57.766 --> 00:00:59.600
I still have a text message for you.

25
00:01:03.966 --> 00:01:05.300
Surveillance and monitoring

26
00:01:05.333 --> 00:01:06.266
You can see it on the surveillance.

27
00:01:06.266 --> 00:01:07.566
I didn't push the tower at all.

28
00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:08.900
I don't have surveillance at all

29
00:01:08.933 --> 00:01:10.900
Impossible Idea

30
00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.400
You better be honest with me.

31
00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.900
People always look at me in the funeral hospital

32
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.666
How could it be dangerous?

33
00:01:18.066 --> 00:01:20.133
It was really Tang Yuxin who lied to me.

34
00:01:20.133 --> 00:01:21.400
You said he lied to you.

35
00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.600
I really don't know why he lied to you.

36
00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:24.500
So I went.

37
00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.200
He was the only one there.

38
00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:27.333
Then suddenly it fell backwards

39
00:01:27.333 --> 00:01:28.366
I want to pull him

40
00:01:28.366 --> 00:01:30.200
He threw my hand away

41
00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:33.266
You mean Tang Yuxin?

42
00:01:33.266 --> 00:01:35.666
Let the child in his belly design it
