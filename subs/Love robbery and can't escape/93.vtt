00:00:06.966 --> 00:00:09.200
I'm ready to go abroad.

2
00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:10.366
Why is that?

3
00:00:11.466 --> 00:00:13.166
Because you want to inherit the family property?

4
00:00:13.166 --> 00:00:15.900
So I'm going to go out and study first

5
00:00:17.333 --> 00:00:18.566
I see.

6
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.500
Then Brother Muchen, you must take care of your health abroad.

7
00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:23.466
I know a little

8
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:31.800
Oh oh

9
00:00:32.466 --> 00:00:35.300
Do you have something on your head to help you?

10
00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.066
Come on in, he's waiting inside.

11
00:00:37.066 --> 00:00:38.266
Yeah, sure.

12
00:00:43.366 --> 00:00:44.166
Oh.

13
00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:47.033
I have a two o'clock flight.

14
00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:48.766
Go now

15
00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:50.166
Are you in such a hurry?

16
00:00:50.166 --> 00:00:52.000
I haven't prepared anything for you yet

17
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.866
No need to suck it, just pour it.

18
00:00:59.766 --> 00:01:02.800
Want a true hug

19
00:01:30.933 --> 00:01:32.066
Why don't you get more sleep?

20
00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.600
I can't sleep without you.

21
00:01:39.333 --> 00:01:41.600
Oops baby just kicked me

22
00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.300
Is he saying hello to me?

23
00:01:43.733 --> 00:01:44.866
What do you mean?

24
00:01:44.866 --> 00:01:47.200
It's only been a few months, how could I kick you?

25
00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:49.366
I don't care! He's always kicking me!

26
00:01:51.733 --> 00:01:54.800
Your little emotions mean a lot to me

27
00:01:58.333 --> 00:01:59.133
miss

28
00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:01.966
I'm glad I didn't lose you.
