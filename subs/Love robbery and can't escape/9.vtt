00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.166
Manager, my brother really needs money right now

2
00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.600
Can you advance my salary for three months?

3
00:00:09.066 --> 00:00:10.533
That's you right.

4
00:00:10.533 --> 00:00:12.366
Then everyone is like you.

5
00:00:12.366 --> 00:00:13.966
Isn't this embarrassing me?

6
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:16.600
But

7
00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.600
If you are really short of money

8
00:00:24.666 --> 00:00:25.800
No need manager

9
00:00:26.166 --> 00:00:27.266
Okay, okay.

10
00:00:28.166 --> 00:00:29.866
Look at you down

11
00:00:29.866 --> 00:00:31.300
Like a dead child

12
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:32.700
Do you have time?

13
00:00:32.733 --> 00:00:34.000
Or just wake him up

14
00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.100
In case you are seen one day

15
00:00:36.166 --> 00:00:36.966
Maybe

16
00:00:40.333 --> 00:00:42.500
Ah-ha.

17
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.500
Ha ha.

18
00:00:45.066 --> 00:00:47.400
Is the beautiful woman short of money?

19
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.633
If you are short of money, follow me

20
00:00:49.966 --> 00:00:52.166
As long as you let me save

21
00:00:52.266 --> 00:00:53.833
How much are you asking?

22
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.266
The master has satisfied you.

23
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.400
You are

24
00:01:01.666 --> 00:01:04.000
Miss Lin

25
00:01:04.133 --> 00:01:07.100
Hey, it seems that it was really arranged by God

26
00:01:07.266 --> 00:01:08.200
Miss Li

27
00:01:08.933 --> 00:01:10.900
Or we will have these fates

28
00:01:10.966 --> 00:01:12.433
I finished something last time

29
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.766
How are you doing?

30
00:01:18.466 --> 00:01:19.500
I'm kidding.

31
00:01:23.166 --> 00:01:25.466
Since Mr. Lin has left

32
00:01:25.466 --> 00:01:26.900
After all, the dead are the big ones

33
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.566
We don't care anymore

34
00:01:29.466 --> 00:01:30.633
Have a drink with me

35
00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:44.300
Come eat go

36
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.966
Hey, it's delicious, I'm right.

37
00:01:47.966 --> 00:01:51.233
Eat well, what good days are there?

38
00:01:51.466 --> 00:01:53.433
A beautiful woman doesn't want to drink

39
00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:55.900
You won't force it.

40
00:01:57.133 --> 00:01:57.933
Go

41
00:02:00.866 --> 00:02:01.900
Face?
