00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:02.733
Which of you is the patient's family member?

2
00:00:02.733 --> 00:00:03.766
The situation is urgent

3
00:00:03.766 --> 00:00:04.866
You need to sign the judge's notice.

4
00:00:04.866 --> 00:00:06.366
I am who you are to him

5
00:00:06.366 --> 00:00:07.433
I'm his wife.

6
00:00:07.533 --> 00:00:08.600
Then you sign it

7
00:00:09.533 --> 00:00:10.966
How is he doing now?

8
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.266
The patient is still in critical condition

9
00:00:12.266 --> 00:00:13.433
We'll do our best.

10
00:00:14.966 --> 00:00:16.266
Must save him

11
00:00:25.166 --> 00:00:26.566
Doctor, how is he?

12
00:00:26.566 --> 00:00:27.333
Just a little bit

13
00:00:27.333 --> 00:00:29.500
Fortunately, the patient survived his last breath

14
00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:30.800
The surgery was relatively successful

15
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.266
But then you must be happy

16
00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:34.300
Thank you doctor

17
00:00:38.933 --> 00:00:40.100
How are you feeling?

18
00:00:41.533 --> 00:00:42.366
Mu Chen

19
00:00:45.366 --> 00:00:49.066
Nini, why don't I go out first?

20
00:00:49.066 --> 00:00:51.566
I have something to talk to my girlfriend alone

21
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.233
Ok then you talk

22
00:00:57.566 --> 00:00:58.366
girlfriend

23
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.566
I really envy you.

24
00:01:00.866 --> 00:01:02.000
Can always have thoughts

25
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.400
You and Nian Nian were not this year before

26
00:01:05.966 --> 00:01:08.000
Although I have always been with Nian Nian

27
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.200
But I know he has always had you in his heart

28
00:01:11.666 --> 00:01:12.966
I always think

29
00:01:13.133 --> 00:01:15.266
Keep him by my side a little longer

30
00:01:15.266 --> 00:01:17.166
So he can always be with me

31
00:01:17.333 --> 00:01:18.600
But now.

32
00:01:18.966 --> 00:01:20.766
And I realized I couldn't fool myself.

33
00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.666
Thank you for taking care of Nian Nian this year

34
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.000
girlfriend

35
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.266
Don't be complacent

36
00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:28.800
I'm just thinking about it now

37
00:01:29.066 --> 00:01:30.533
Temporarily handed over to you

38
00:01:30.533 --> 00:01:33.600
But if you dare to treat him badly

39
00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:34.966
How dare you bully him?

40
00:01:35.333 --> 00:01:36.633
No matter the ends of the earth

41
00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:38.566
A bowl of pure meat

42
00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.700
Don't worry, there won't be such a piece of stuff.

43
00:01:42.533 --> 00:01:43.766
Better kill
