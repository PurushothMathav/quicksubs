00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:02.600
I haven't seen you for a long time

2
00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:04.833
Did something happen to you?

3
00:00:04.866 --> 00:00:07.866
I'm fine, but I'm a little sick.

4
00:00:08.066 --> 00:00:09.533
Just rested for a while

5
00:00:09.533 --> 00:00:10.500
How is that possible?

6
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.000
That's a long time.

7
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.500
The hospital has no record of your visit

8
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.300
There's no way you're not going to see your brother.

9
00:00:16.366 --> 00:00:17.666
Tell me the truth.

10
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.033
It's really okay.

11
00:00:20.666 --> 00:00:23.066
OK, if you don't want to talk

12
00:00:23.066 --> 00:00:24.466
I'll check it myself

13
00:00:24.766 --> 00:00:26.533
Mu Chen, Brother Mu Chen, don't go

14
00:00:26.533 --> 00:00:28.600
I said not yet?

15
00:00:28.733 --> 00:00:31.166
It's because I didn't do well at work some time ago.

16
00:00:31.166 --> 00:00:32.300
Offended Mr. Gu

17
00:00:32.366 --> 00:00:35.400
So he moved me somewhere else.

18
00:00:37.533 --> 00:00:38.333
So

19
00:00:39.133 --> 00:00:41.400
Your leg hurt because of this

20
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:42.500
Here's my leg.

21
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.133
I'm fine, I just got a little hurt.

22
00:00:51.133 --> 00:00:53.000
By the way, Brother Muchen, I won't tell you anymore.

23
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.300
I'm going in first.

24
00:00:54.766 --> 00:00:57.800
Well listen to me wait for me

25
00:00:59.066 --> 00:01:02.000
What are you doing with my secretary?

26
00:01:02.733 --> 00:01:03.533
Mr. Gu
