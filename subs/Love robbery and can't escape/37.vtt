00:00:02.066 --> 00:00:02.866
Come here.

2
00:00:10.566 --> 00:00:11.566
I'll tell you what.

3
00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.533
I hate it when people touch my things.

4
00:00:14.533 --> 00:00:18.100
What happened today is not allowed to happen a second time

5
00:00:18.533 --> 00:00:20.633
Every minute of your life

6
00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:22.266
Can only move the tire

7
00:00:23.133 --> 00:00:26.666
Understand? Say if it wasn't for him

8
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:28.400
How could my mother possibly die?

9
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.666
How could I be ridiculed by myself?

10
00:00:31.666 --> 00:00:33.133
Living a life of begging

11
00:00:33.133 --> 00:00:34.300
What's the matter with you?

12
00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:36.966
Shouldn't you be in pain?

13
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.833
It's no longer necessary

14
00:00:40.466 --> 00:00:43.166
I know what it feels like to lose a loved one

15
00:00:43.566 --> 00:00:46.366
I know how powerless that feeling is

16
00:00:47.666 --> 00:00:49.866
You can at least take revenge on me

17
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.433
I can't take revenge on you anymore.

18
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.700
If it makes you feel more at ease

19
00:00:58.566 --> 00:01:01.466
Continue? No, no.

20
00:01:04.266 --> 00:01:05.633
You shouldn't have this reaction

21
00:01:07.866 --> 00:01:08.666
i

22
00:01:09.166 --> 00:01:10.966
I don't need your pity.

23
00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.066
I don't need your pity.

24
00:01:13.533 --> 00:01:15.866
You remember me you remember me

25
00:01:15.966 --> 00:01:17.900
To make your life worse than death

26
00:01:18.566 --> 00:01:21.700
I must let you survive

27
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.300
beg for death

28
00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.866
Mom, everything I do is for you

29
00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.066
But why?

30
00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:48.800
Why do I suddenly feel like I made a mistake today?

31
00:01:49.066 --> 00:01:51.633
Mom, I brought down Lin's

32
00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.000
Brother Lin is also dead

33
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.233
Even I'm still torturing his daughter

34
00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:57.866
But why?

35
00:01:57.866 --> 00:02:00.033
Why am I not happy at all?

36
00:02:00.266 --> 00:02:02.166
I don't want to be anything.

37
00:02:02.333 --> 00:02:06.066
I don't want to go to any wealthy family either, mom

38
00:02:08.066 --> 00:02:09.866
I just wish we mother and son

39
00:02:10.266 --> 00:02:12.466
To lead a simple and happy life

40
00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.533
If I could choose

41
00:02:16.533 --> 00:02:18.266
I can live without money

42
00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:20.300
No status.

43
00:02:21.266 --> 00:02:22.566
No right

44
00:02:23.133 --> 00:02:25.633
I just hope you can come back

45
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.033
Ah!

46
00:02:29.466 --> 00:02:33.666
Ah, I really miss you

47
00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.033
Dad, the mistake you made

48
00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:46.700
I'll pay it back for you
