00:00:00.466 --> 00:00:02.300
Salute I beg you

2
00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:04.766
I'm willing to drink as much as I can make money

3
00:00:04.933 --> 00:00:06.600
Please give me a chance.

4
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.766
I beg you, wizened

5
00:00:08.766 --> 00:00:10.133
A wry smile

6
00:00:10.133 --> 00:00:10.933
No.

7
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.433
Manager I beg you

8
00:00:13.733 --> 00:00:15.600
My brother is still ill.

9
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.700
I really need the money

10
00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:20.800
I beg you to give me a chance

11
00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.800
Hey, everyone here says that about him

12
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.700
But this face

13
00:00:27.066 --> 00:00:29.100
Not bad, so be it

14
00:00:29.366 --> 00:00:30.633
Try it for a few days

15
00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:33.333
If you don't do it well, get out of here immediately

16
00:00:33.333 --> 00:00:35.000
I'll do well elf

17
00:00:40.466 --> 00:00:41.733
Brothers to be punished

18
00:00:41.733 --> 00:00:43.266
This time I borrowed 50 million

19
00:00:43.266 --> 00:00:45.300
Half as much as me with interest.

20
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.400
Get out of my way

21
00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:47.800
You immortal

22
00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.433
If you can't pay the loan shark

23
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:50.700
You fucking take me

24
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.100
Can you stop for two more days?

25
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.366
Brother Wang, this is my favorite vase of Peanut Sword

26
00:00:57.366 --> 00:00:59.000
I beg you not to touch him

27
00:00:59.966 --> 00:01:02.500
Why go so far

28
00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.300
I can't do it in two days.

29
00:01:04.933 --> 00:01:05.866
How about this?

30
00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:07.833
Let your daughter tonight

31
00:01:07.866 --> 00:01:09.366
How about being happy with me?

32
00:01:09.366 --> 00:01:14.766
Ahaha, what are you taking? Do it, Dad.

33
00:01:16.266 --> 00:01:17.066
Dad?

34
00:01:18.533 --> 00:01:19.333
Dad?

35
00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:25.466
Ah!

36
00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:27.200
Ah dad

37
00:01:27.733 --> 00:01:29.833
Don't scare me, okay?

38
00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.466
Dad, please save me first

39
00:01:36.733 --> 00:01:38.166
Marry me again

40
00:01:38.766 --> 00:01:39.633
Ha ha.

41
00:01:40.333 --> 00:01:42.433
Lao Tzu, hold on

42
00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:52.033
They overdose, they have a heart attack.

43
00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:53.600
We've cleaned it up.

44
00:01:54.066 --> 00:01:55.200
Ready to die

45
00:01:58.466 --> 00:02:01.033
If the clouds were the sky

46
00:02:03.133 --> 00:02:03.933
Let's go

47
00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.766
Doctor? Is there a doctor?

48
00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:11.600
Ah!

49
00:02:12.766 --> 00:02:13.566
Ah!

50
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.700
Grandpa grandpa

51
00:02:16.566 --> 00:02:19.166
Doctor? Is there a doctor?

52
00:02:20.366 --> 00:02:21.366
After diagnosis

53
00:02:21.366 --> 00:02:23.900
Your brother is confirmed to have acute leukemia

54
00:02:23.933 --> 00:02:25.966
Arrange for your brother to be hospitalized ASAP
