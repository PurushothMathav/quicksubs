00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.666
Mr. Gu, I just met Li Shao by chance

2
00:00:02.733 --> 00:00:04.133
Just a few words of greeting with him

3
00:00:04.133 --> 00:00:04.933
Humph

4
00:00:05.666 --> 00:00:08.133
Is that right? I think if I were a few minutes late

5
00:00:08.133 --> 00:00:10.200
You all did it for real

6
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.666
Dawn you bastard

7
00:00:12.933 --> 00:00:16.233
Li Shao, please don't insult us, Mr. Gu

8
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.666
Please leave immediately

9
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.600
Well, it seems that I usually train well

10
00:00:22.666 --> 00:00:25.833
At a critical time, I also know that mutual aid ancient immigrants

11
00:00:30.533 --> 00:00:34.366
Mr. Li, I don't bother you if I don't have anything.

12
00:00:34.766 --> 00:00:35.800
Come with me!

13
00:00:36.666 --> 00:00:38.933
Does Li Shao need me to call?

14
00:00:38.933 --> 00:00:40.366
Ask your father to come over

15
00:00:42.866 --> 00:00:45.400
Cool Yingming, don't think I'm afraid of you

16
00:00:45.566 --> 00:00:47.333
Don't go with him for a year

17
00:00:47.333 --> 00:00:49.233
It's really over the top

18
00:00:51.266 --> 00:00:52.066
Let's go

19
00:00:52.733 --> 00:00:54.200
I miss you

20
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:55.400
miss

21
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.433
You wait for me.

22
00:01:00.666 --> 00:01:03.300
It seems that I can't let you out for a second

23
00:01:03.333 --> 00:01:05.400
Mr. Gu, today is really just a coincidence

24
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.766
Believe it yourself

25
00:01:07.766 --> 00:01:10.100
I won't and dare not lie to you.

26
00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:11.200
See how ruthless you are

27
00:01:11.333 --> 00:01:14.266
Wu Ma is taking good care of him for me.

28
00:01:14.266 --> 00:01:15.866
Don't leave the door for half a step

29
00:01:15.866 --> 00:01:17.066
What about eating?

30
00:01:21.133 --> 00:01:23.066
Mr. Gu, please

31
00:01:23.066 --> 00:01:25.966
I beg you not to leave me here alone

32
00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:27.833
I beg you

33
00:01:28.266 --> 00:01:30.266
Why are you opening the door?
