00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:01.666
Except my dad

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.800
Can Mr. Gu think of any other way to threaten me?

3
00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.133
You did remind me

4
00:00:07.133 --> 00:00:09.066
Your brother doesn't seem to know yet

5
00:00:09.066 --> 00:00:10.433
How did he die?

6
00:00:11.066 --> 00:00:12.700
You said if I told him

7
00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:14.466
Will he give me something?

8
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.033
Or revenge for my father

9
00:00:18.266 --> 00:00:21.466
You bastard hahahahaha

10
00:00:22.266 --> 00:00:23.900
I'm not here today

11
00:00:24.066 --> 00:00:25.633
Your temper has risen a lot

12
00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:29.400
I don't need to stay in the hospital anymore

13
00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.000
Pack up your things and come back with me

14
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.100
Mr. Gu

15
00:00:40.566 --> 00:00:42.766
Go check it out for me right now. You're leaving the hospital

16
00:00:42.766 --> 00:00:45.300
Go to all information Yes

17
00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.433
I hope to cooperate with Mr. Gu this time.

18
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:53.900
Can be very enjoyable

19
00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:55.066
Where? Where?

20
00:00:55.166 --> 00:00:57.266
I also hope that Mr. Wei will give more advice

21
00:00:57.266 --> 00:01:01.133
Hahaha, Premier Gu is too modest.

22
00:01:01.133 --> 00:01:04.733
Thank you Mr. Gu for your hospitality today

23
00:01:04.733 --> 00:01:06.800
Mr. Wei likes to run away

24
00:01:07.766 --> 00:01:10.400
Secretary Lin looks familiar

25
00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.166
I wonder if I can have a drink with Secretary Lin?

26
00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:16.500
Certainly!

27
00:01:16.766 --> 00:01:18.633
Hahahaha

28
00:01:20.666 --> 00:01:22.500
Mr. Hu has investigated the monitoring

29
00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:22.800
But

30
00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.200
I didn't see how Miss Lin left the hospital
