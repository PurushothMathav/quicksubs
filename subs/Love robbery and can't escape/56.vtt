00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:02.633
I also need RMB for something important.

2
00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:05.766
We can't send him back to his position.

3
00:00:06.166 --> 00:00:07.400
It's okay. It's okay.

4
00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.066
Anyway, I'm tired of playing

5
00:00:09.066 --> 00:00:10.833
Take him away quickly

6
00:00:11.333 --> 00:00:14.000
I'm not going, you're not going back

7
00:00:14.366 --> 00:00:17.133
Let go of me

8
00:00:17.133 --> 00:00:20.766
Mr. Gu, what kind of eyes do you still have?

9
00:00:20.933 --> 00:00:22.600
What did you mean by that?

10
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.233
Hmm

11
00:00:24.333 --> 00:00:25.666
Which sentence?

12
00:00:26.366 --> 00:00:28.866
What is 01 saying that the technology is very good?

13
00:00:28.866 --> 00:00:30.466
You and your brother are very happy

14
00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:31.166
What do you mean?

15
00:00:31.166 --> 00:00:35.400
Oh oh I mean ah 01 said he is very skilled

16
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.966
No wonder you brought him with you in the library?

17
00:00:37.966 --> 00:00:39.733
Actually that's what I meant

18
00:00:39.733 --> 00:00:41.800
Ouch, don't oops, stop hitting

19
00:00:42.466 --> 00:00:43.300
Mr. Guo

20
00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:47.100
Mr. Guo, are you threatening me to say that?

21
00:00:47.966 --> 00:00:49.233
Ah, what do you mean?

22
00:00:49.966 --> 00:00:51.500
Call Gu Yiming

23
00:00:51.766 --> 00:00:54.200
Just do as I just said

24
00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:57.766
Auntie, can you put the knife down first?

25
00:00:58.466 --> 00:00:59.266
sister

26
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.500
Mr. Gu, why did you suddenly call me?

27
00:01:07.366 --> 00:01:08.700
I really don't know.

28
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.566
Why did he make us say that?

29
00:01:10.566 --> 00:01:13.566
If I had known earlier that you were related to Taizhou

30
00:01:13.566 --> 00:01:16.666
How could I possibly have him by my side?

31
00:01:16.866 --> 00:01:19.233
Hey, I'm warning you!

32
00:01:19.333 --> 00:01:21.500
Don't let him know you're impersonating, right?
