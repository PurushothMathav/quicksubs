00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:01.200
Nini

2
00:00:02.366 --> 00:00:04.600
Guess what delicious food I made for you today?

3
00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:06.766
You can also cook

4
00:00:07.933 --> 00:00:09.066
Who else?

5
00:00:09.966 --> 00:00:11.966
Without a friend of mine

6
00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:13.866
Oh so

7
00:00:14.666 --> 00:00:17.800
Come, come and taste it. How does it taste?

8
00:00:17.866 --> 00:00:19.633
OK, what are you doing?

9
00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:23.600
Come, Miss Li

10
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.900
This is made by our Mr. Gu himself, please try it

11
00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.000
I can't believe you can still cook

12
00:00:31.566 --> 00:00:34.766
Strange why I thought of him

13
00:00:35.666 --> 00:00:36.466
Ah!

14
00:00:36.766 --> 00:00:37.866
delicious

15
00:00:38.733 --> 00:00:40.300
It's delicious, you should eat more

16
00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.800
You see, you've been tired and thin all this time

17
00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.866
Oh, yeah, there's something I want to tell you. Hmm.

18
00:00:45.866 --> 00:00:47.466
Have you ever felt that recently

19
00:00:47.533 --> 00:00:49.633
There are a lot more customers in the store.

20
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:53.300
What do you mean?

21
00:00:53.333 --> 00:00:54.633
I have investigated

22
00:00:54.933 --> 00:00:58.433
Eighty percent of customers show up every 10 minutes

23
00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.666
Very few are irregular

24
00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.400
You mean you suspect someone is guiding customers?

25
00:01:07.166 --> 00:01:09.700
That's the one that stops there every day

26
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.366
I was wondering if I should take a look.

27
00:01:12.366 --> 00:01:13.500
I will accompany you.

28
00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.266
Yeah, OK.
