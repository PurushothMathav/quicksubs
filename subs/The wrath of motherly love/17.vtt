Ah hello hello

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:04.500
Come, please sit down and drink

3
00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:11.220
The project has been finalized

4
00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:13.260
Earthwork can also be done

5
00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.140
What about the decoration?

6
00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.100
Don't worry.

7
00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:19.360
Don't worry.

8
00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:21.160
What do you think?

9
00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:22.500
Is it okay?

10
00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:24.020
I think so.

11
00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:30.180
Oh, my brother's question is simply in my heart, hahaha, okay.

12
00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.700
That's the deal.

13
00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:35.260
I'll go back to the company and give you your contract

14
00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.060
Xiaoli

15
00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:38.740
Treat Mr. Gao well

16
00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.920
Don't be polite.

17
00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.180
Don't worry, hahaha.

18
00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:51.340
Mr. Gao, go out for a walk

19
00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:54.100
Hahaha

20
00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.400
It's not good for Mr. Gao to drive himself, right?

21
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.580
Hahaha, there is actually something wrong, haha.

22
00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.020
Mr. Gao

23
00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:18.720
Your tie is crooked

24
00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.280
Let me help you sort it out.

25
00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.820
Ok haha

26
00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.100
Okay, Miss An, let's have dinner together

27
00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:56.720
Certainly.

28
00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.420
Let's go hahaha

29
00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.260
