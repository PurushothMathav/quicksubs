00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:03.880
Guo Mingqiang, you are crazy, I am crazy

2
00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:07.620
Hahaha wants me to get out of the house

3
00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:09.180
You dream you

4
00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.340
Autonavi

5
00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:21.520
You're not already in the car, are you?

6
00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:22.320
Humph

7
00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.300
Get out of here

8
00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.040
It concerns the Ango family

9
00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:29.700
I'm not as careless as you are

10
00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:31.740
Don't worry.

11
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.840
I've already had the bomb tampered with

12
00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.620
You don't have to worry at all

13
00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:37.920
It's true.

14
00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.420
Believe it or not?

15
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.220
Hahahahaha

16
00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:48.020
Husband husband, listen to me explain husband husband

17
00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.900
Ah, kill you and break up?

18
00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.420
My brother dares to threaten me

19
00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:03.680
I let you threaten me

20
00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:04.700
Let you threaten

21
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.340
I let you threaten

22
00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:11.740
My Queen

23
00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.500
For an outsider

24
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.900
Kill me alone

25
00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.300
My eldest lady said

26
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.980
Let me see it.

27
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.420
What kind of Red Army is he?

28
00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.980
Pushed you into this

29
00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.380
I can satisfy you.

30
00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.620
Did I get robbed for 48,000 miles?

31
00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.700
Yeah, that's him.

32
00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:44.980
Ha ha.

33
00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.300
The Autonavi Show

34
00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.100
Don't be too happy

35
00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:57.140
You will die at his hands

36
00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:03.380
You will die at his hands what do you mean

37
00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.260
You will die.

38
00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:10.140
You will die

39
00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:24.680
Miss, didn't they find a channel to get the high-priced bomb by themselves?

40
00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.820
How did our people come into contact?

41
00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.740
How could we possibly touch something like that?

42
00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.660
How about toothpaste?
