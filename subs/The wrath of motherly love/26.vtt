00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:08.980
You did it, you bastard.

3
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.000
Mom

4
00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:14.420
What should we do?

Hello, this is Hanfa Law Firm

Excuse me, do you need it or not in the personnel department? No, no, no.

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:34.680
We also handle divorce matters here

Special planning for property distribution

Mom, won't it be a problem to eat like this?

11
00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:52.880
Didn't you listen to the lawyer?

12
00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:54.960
I also want our mother not to be kicked out of the house

13
00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.980
You can only force your father to sign the agreement

14
00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.140
What? I'm relieved.

15
00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:01.520
I know your dad better than you do

16
00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:02.900
He is more afraid of death than anyone else

17
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:05.380
It will work.

18
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.580

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.400
Dexiong, uh, we're all getting a divorce

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.020
Have one last meal with me

22
00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.980
Please, I'll go after eating

23
00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:31.820
Oh, hop in.

24
00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:33.500
OK

25
00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.260
Do you have something to say

26
00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:01.960
Autonavi signed him

27
00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:03.460
Let's get together and break up

28
00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.180
Want a great bachelor

29
00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:14.540

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.900
Drive this wind turbine down for me

32
00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.500
Don't listen to him if you want to live

33
00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.940
I grew up in the car

34
00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.060
Then we will die together
