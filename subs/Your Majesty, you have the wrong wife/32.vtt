00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:03.380
What are you going to do? Who are you?

2
00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:05.190
That's him! What do you mean by raising people for fun?

3
00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:06.710
Yes, everyone can support one person.

4
00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:08.730
My wife died after taking just two pills!

5
00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:10.190
It’s him who still kills my wife!

6
00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:11.410
I also want to give back to those who are perfect!

7
00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:13.110
I just bought it on the spot!

8
00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:13.570
Who is it!

9
00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:14.450
Which one to buy?

10
00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:16.309
People are so shameless on Black Mirror now!

11
00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:17.870
Why do you worry so much about the cold weather?

12
00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:19.050
I want to play with it!

13
00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:20.790
They are all based on their faces!

14
00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:22.870
Why do you think it’s okay for others to eat it?

15
00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:24.390
But your wife is in trouble after eating it!

16
00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:27.350
Tell me! Could it be that your wife ate something else?

17
00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:28.590
That’s why it happened!

18
00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:29.870
My wife!

19
00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:31.570
It's true. If you are dead,

20
00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:34.580
Don't marry me, sister, I'll tell you

21
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:37.860
Not everyone can turn it on and off, right? You tell me.

22
00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:38.880
from childhood to adulthood

23
00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.160
No poison - iron

24
00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:41.900
How could you possibly know anything?

25
00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.100
Beauty bowl

26
00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:44.260
Now it kills people

27
00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:46.280
Why don't you stop quickly?

28
00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.420
Do you want to harm yourself and become a human being?

29
00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.060
Master Duyuanlou can't do anything anymore.

30
00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:51.940
It's all her business

31
00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:53.300
What will happen to me in the future?

32
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:53.400
What will happen to me in the future?

33
00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:54.980
How can you treat her herself

34
00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:56.450
The medicine toy I made

35
00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:57.070
Is there any problem

36
00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:58.250
I know best in my heart

37
00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:59.790
If you are not worried

38
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.720
Can be taken anywhere for inspection

39
00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:05.660
If something goes wrong I'll cover it for you

40
00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:07.540
What medicine did your wife take today?

41
00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:10.730
Take it and let me check it, right?

42
00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:11.630
can't give it to you

43
00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:13.270
What if you change the package?

44
00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:13.850
Anyway, my wife

45
00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:15.650
I died after taking your medicine. You have no money.

46
00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:17.630
If you want me to wrap the money, don't worry about it.

47
00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:18.690
Wrap a handful

48
00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:19.670
My wife's face

49
00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:20.430
Very supportive of you

50
00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:22.750
Then what if I don’t wrap it up?

51
00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:24.350
How can I tell you to go away?
