00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:07.220
Your Majesty, Your Majesty is online now,

2
00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.910
But there are many more like this. Forget it.

3
00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:11.800
Your Majesty, the kilometers just came.

4
00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:14.200
He said that there will be a family ceremony today and all your princesses should go.

5
00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:17.410
knew.

6
00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.560
It's better to take him down and give him a new girlfriend, yes.

7
00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:23.380
Miss Lin, I heard that King Rui was deposed,

8
00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.540
It was supposed to be you. Don't talk nonsense,

9
00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:27.460
I have already given marriage to the Queen.

10
00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.240
If this word gets out, there will be people in the Senhuan family.

11
00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.020
Yes, yes, yes. Miss Yun is about to marry the emperor,

12
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.820
Finally, the imperial concubine, how can you argue with Miss Yun?

13
00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:41.010
It's true that they can't be compared to each other.

14
00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.970
Put me and Bai Leihua together

15
00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.720
I find it embarrassing, sister, you are here.

16
00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:49.340
Everyone thinks itâ€™s just a flower right now

17
00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:50.240
Just don't care

18
00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:52.400
Rebirth others' speechless words

19
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:53.780
This is verbal violence

20
00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:54.980
not as good as others

21
00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:56.120
abandon others

22
00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:57.460
This is language language

23
00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:58.760
What about this kind of person?

24
00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:59.820
should die

25
00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.640
Sister, how can you talk like this?

26
00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:04.300
We just open the school, we just open the school

27
00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:06.150
my dad is funny

28
00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:07.860
are you okay

29
00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:12.510
what the hell are you doing
