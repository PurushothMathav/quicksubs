00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:05.030
Uncle Wang: We didn’t want to make a big deal about this matter, but we didn’t know about it like the Empress Dowager Nian did.

2
00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:07.930
Yun Linlong is right, how could the Queen Mother know about this?

3
00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:08.840
That's fine with you.

4
00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:11.540
It's fine that the second brother is fine. It's just that the second brother is so rich on May Day.

5
00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:13.860
I don’t know who will hurt my second brother. Thank you for your concern, Your Majesty.

6
00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:15.780
I am still investigating this matter.

7
00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:17.760
My mouth is rather harsh at the moment, but,

8
00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:22.060
Starting from their family members, I believe we will soon know the truth of the matter.

9
00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.840
The king still has to deal with this matter as a woman.

10
00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.510
The prince was injured because he was trying to save his daughter.

11
00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:31.980
My daughter, please deal with the prince and your sister.

12
00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.320
Before you know you are always always always with you

13
00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.680
It’s just that it’s being spread outside now

14
00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.300
clarity and sleepiness

15
00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:47.900
I still want to take off, Your Majesty

16
00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:49.640
King Chen Yu is also innocent

17
00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:50.760
Emperor Jing ascends to the Ming Dynasty

18
00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:52.610
Yes, Your Majesty

19
00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:53.570
My home is Qingcheng

20
00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:54.810
Never do this

21
00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:55.990
Shameless

22
00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:58.110
I really know I have to read it again

23
00:00:58.330 --> 00:00:59.310
As long as politics comes

24
00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:00.390
It's enough that you are innocent

25
00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.340
I want to force my second brother and second sister-in-law

26
00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:10.490
You won't mind. Thank you, Your Majesty. Thank you, Your Majesty.

27
00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:12.760
Continue to add tests

28
00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:20.850
Please tell me about the room

29
00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:30.210
Thank you for everything before

30
00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:33.660
Thank me I didn't do anything

31
00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:34.760
I don’t need to thank me either

32
00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:36.390
Have you forgotten what happened before?

33
00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.480
What is it? Miss Chen is not worth it.

34
00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:39.930
Who is he?

35
00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:43.940
Didn't go to the market that night?
