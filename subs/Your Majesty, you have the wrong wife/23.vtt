00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:03.670
Excuse me, what are you saying? I can't hear you clearly at all.

2
00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:09.210
Miss Yu, I really forgot that night.

3
00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:11.870
Your Majesty, if you ask my nanny for his concern,

4
00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.110
This flight is a flight of aeronautics.

5
00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:18.430
It's quite rude to say, it shouldn't be.

6
00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:22.890
It belongs to me, King Tongtong. I will resign.

7
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:38.420
Who is it? Come out, it's me.

8
00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.240
What are you doing in this hat?

9
00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:41.820
Give me your head and follow me, why should I talk to you?

10
00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:43.700
I'm not interested, sister.

11
00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:46.140
Today I am preparing a kind biography.

12
00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:55.000
Say it, you?

13
00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:56.120
What are you going to do?

14
00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.680
I haven't caught you recently, so what are you going to do?

15
00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:01.860
I'm often the number one beauty girl, but today you're the one who wants to meet me

16
00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:02.660
You are so proud

17
00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:03.580
Take advantage of your illness

18
00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:05.430
If you want to go to school again, don't say anything about it.

19
00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:06.790
Take away one million

20
00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:07.770
Be the head of a household

21
00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:08.730
This money is mine

22
00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:09.750
You are not qualified

23
00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:11.460
I'm not qualified

24
00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:12.860
You all helped kill my mother.

25
00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:15.360
I came here because of the fate of your original family.

26
00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:18.540
Even if I take one million, I think it’s too little. I’ll give you one more.

27
00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:19.800
if it weren't for me

28
00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.760
Are you qualified to do this Huan Guifei?

29
00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:23.500
Tell you, stay away from me

30
00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.290
If you don't let me correct myself, you won't be able to do anything.

31
00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.300
You are so far behind

32
00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:30.750
You've done it less

33
00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:31.830
who do you think you are

34
00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:33.410
How about you becoming Princess Wei now?

35
00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:34.440
I don't like it

36
00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:36.870
You can now make no difference in money

37
00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:38.710
There was no difference before, right?

38
00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:39.210
I promise

39
00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.410
Is there any difference in appearance?

40
00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:41.090
I tell you

41
00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:42.350
Don't do anything about your waist.

42
00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:43.370
Otherwise I have to blind you
