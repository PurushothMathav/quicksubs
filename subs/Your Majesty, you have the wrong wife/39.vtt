00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.530
What do you need to know if you die?

2
00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:05.250
There will be no one to take care of your family

3
00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:06.950
What happened to someone like him?

4
00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:08.370
The main idea is to blow you to the front

5
00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:11.650
Is it really worth protecting? Thank you, miss.

6
00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:12.940
Although you are my fruit

7
00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:14.120
But do something like this

8
00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:15.920
It’s also unforgivable, don’t worry

9
00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:21.180
I will take good care of your family. Take good care of it.

10
00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.420
My sister really knows how to speak the truth

11
00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:24.480
You just don’t know if a person dies

12
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:25.980
These things are good

13
00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.360
No one is pursuing it anymore

14
00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:30.220
Sister, please don’t ask me to see you, I am the Yulin Dragon

15
00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:31.960
What else are you doing?

16
00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:33.210
Qingchen said he didn't do it

17
00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.030
Just didn't do it

18
00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:36.280
Are you going to make a move? I know.

19
00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.300
You and I are fellow lucky sisters

20
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.300
My sister has suffered a lot since she was a child

21
00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:41.960
My sister is willing to give up everything to her sister

22
00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:43.520
Fortunately, I did something wrong

23
00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:44.920
But in the end it’s about me

24
00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:46.360
If my sister can't forgive me

25
00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:49.450
Then I can kneel down to accompany you in the morning

26
00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:50.680
You don't need to apologize

27
00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:53.780
Have you done anything wrong, my lord?

28
00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:54.990
do you know

29
00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:57.410
You are really as forgetful as ever
