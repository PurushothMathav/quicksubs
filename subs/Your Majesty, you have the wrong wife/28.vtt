00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:01.750
You still have the energy to curse.

2
00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:05.350
What do you want to do? You think I'm better and you want to beat me again.

3
00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:07.180
Yun Linlong, if I get the net, please sue you.

4
00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:09.440
Don't challenge my patience.

5
00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:11.510
I'm so stupid to ask you. You.

6
00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:14.250
I agree, just say a few words less.

7
00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.270
Don't think about the situation. OK, you're right,

8
00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.370
If you look good, don’t let your eyes suffer. Tell me.

9
00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.870
What are you going to do? You're fine and I'm going to rest again.

10
00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:24.750
This website came to see you today to ask,

11
00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:26.560
Anyone is afraid of this.

12
00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.860
That's what I did, this is mine.

13
00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:30.410
Are you sure this is yours.

14
00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:32.729
You take my handkerchief and ask me whose it is.

15
00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:34.180
There is another person above this, you.

16
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.180
You're so stupid, don't you

17
00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:41.590
You don’t want it, Lin Long, you

18
00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.320
It’s great to see you go public.

19
00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:49.420
Now that you are well

20
00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:50.020
This material room

21
00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:51.180
I want the other person’s other garbage

22
00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:55.130
Please don't go out, you piece of trash, and walk away by yourself.

23
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.540
Has this really not changed?

24
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.319
You don't know
