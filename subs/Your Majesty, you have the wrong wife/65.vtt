00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.760
The Queen Mother has disturbed her life. Why don't I dare to touch the Han Dynasty no matter what?

2
00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:07.340
Your Majesty, please don’t be careless. As a medical officer,

3
00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.300
Is it normal to go to a medical officer to buy Yaosheng?

4
00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:12.300
Your Majesty, this is not fate, this is one of the reasons.

5
00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:16.270
This man bought the fairy, and the emperor happened to use the fairy.

6
00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:19.910
Doesn't this just mean that this person wants to touch the Han Emperor?

7
00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:23.140
Sister, when you came here you didn’t even have any evidence, so you came here to prove me.

8
00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:25.160
Why can't the prince prove him?

9
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.160
The wall is so reasonable, it was obviously your key that killed the emperor,

10
00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:29.700
Still want to recommend it to others?

11
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:31.300
My sister said I harmed the emperor

12
00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:32.780
Does my sister have any evidence?

13
00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:34.260
If you have no evidence

14
00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:37.740
She's my sister, don't talk nonsense, Xu Yiguan

15
00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:39.420
You'd better be honest and proud

16
00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.840
A certain emperor is not just you

17
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:45.300
It will also strip away your responsibilities and your lower body

18
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.440
The whole lower body obeyed the orders of Dr. Wang.

19
00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:48.860
Go buy Tianxianzi

20
00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:51.620
Little Queen Mother Ming Jian

21
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.680
Cheng definitely did not pass the first level of Xu

22
00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:55.080
Go buy Buyian Xianzi

23
00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:56.560
The dead man harasses important ministers for no reason

24
00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:59.150
Don't be sniffed by the prince

25
00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:00.820
Doctor Wang has been in the public eye for many years

26
00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:02.800
How could he possibly murder the emperor?

27
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:03.860
Promise him not to talk nonsense

28
00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:05.290
I'm not talking nonsense

29
00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:06.740
The minister said six pieces of evidence

30
00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:07.440
able to prove

31
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:10.520
Is it the evidence of Tianxianzi that Dr. Wang asked his ministers to buy?

32
00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.000
This is Doctor Wang

33
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.320
Prescriptions written in letters

34
00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.060
I asked my subordinates to buy Tianxianzi

35
00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:18.070
Fortunately, we can check clearly
