00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:13.020
Why am I still listening to this in Longza?

2
00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:15.940
These two people haven't been careful, so is your princess?

3
00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:17.520
He obviously knows that the prince cares about him so much

4
00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:18.960
It’s not about the prince’s promotion

5
00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.060
Your prince is the one who goes too far.

6
00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.580
Nothing masculine at all

7
00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:23.840
Still angry at such a young age over trivial matters

8
00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:25.260
It's obviously your princess who is the most outrageous

9
00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:26.120
The prince is the most exaggerated

10
00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.070
The prince and the princess are in confinement this time.

11
00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.970
Eleven cares about legs

12
00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:45.900
Just now, if my subordinate heard the princess talking about healing herself during confinement,

13
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:46.480
what did she say

14
00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.630
The concubine just said something sorry for the prince

15
00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.360
Her prince said that because he was sad and sad.

16
00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:54.940
He is deceiving me.

17
00:00:58.780 --> 00:00:59.800
Just say that he doesn’t have anyone he likes at all.

18
00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:01.560
Watch him fly away

19
00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:03.480
Ah, Your Majesty, Your Majesty

20
00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.050
This is what you basically said. The king said he regretted it.
