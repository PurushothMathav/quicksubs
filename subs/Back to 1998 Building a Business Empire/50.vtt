00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.300
die

2
00:00:03.866 --> 00:00:08.166
It's dead, oops, what a big one.

3
00:00:08.166 --> 00:00:10.500
Is anyone there?

4
00:00:11.366 --> 00:00:12.166
Hey

5
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.500
Oh, come back to this car

6
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:16.700
Come in come in

7
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.666
I ate too long

8
00:00:22.933 --> 00:00:23.900
That that

9
00:00:24.533 --> 00:00:29.300
That's kind of stylish, right?

10
00:00:30.566 --> 00:00:32.933
Mr. Cheng is in the limelight, right?

11
00:00:32.933 --> 00:00:34.033
Excuse me.

12
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.100
You may be disappointed.

13
00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.466
I don't need to invest

14
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.100
But as far as I know

15
00:00:40.366 --> 00:00:42.500
It seems like you were looking for a buyer the other day.

16
00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.900
Ready to get rid of the software you developed in your mind

17
00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:46.033
Is there such a thing?

18
00:00:47.533 --> 00:00:48.866
These people?

19
00:00:49.066 --> 00:00:51.566
Or you want to buy pirated software.

20
00:00:51.733 --> 00:00:53.633
Or you want to pay for me

21
00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:56.566
The software I made isn't worth 10,000 dollars

22
00:00:56.733 --> 00:00:58.366
So I decided not to sell it.

23
00:00:58.466 --> 00:01:00.100
Certainly not worth 10,000

24
00:01:00.333 --> 00:01:02.133
If you're here to humiliate me

25
00:01:02.133 --> 00:01:04.000
I suggest you leave now

26
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.400
I'm here to invest in you

27
00:01:12.966 --> 00:01:14.966
I really like the software you developed.

28
00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:17.666
I think the future of instant messaging software

29
00:01:17.666 --> 00:01:19.633
It should be the news

30
00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.333
game social

31
00:01:21.333 --> 00:01:23.833
Photography comes together

32
00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:25.300
Will become a part of our lives

33
00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:26.400
Inseparable software

34
00:01:26.466 --> 00:01:27.833
I don't think you are q.

35
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.766
It should become such software

36
00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.666
Yeah, that's what I think.

37
00:01:31.966 --> 00:01:33.166
What a pity!

38
00:01:33.266 --> 00:01:35.733
It's a pity that you still have a lot of software problems now.

39
00:01:35.733 --> 00:01:37.100
Distance to success

40
00:01:37.533 --> 00:01:39.400
That's a long way off.

41
00:01:39.766 --> 00:01:42.266
Is it that serious?
