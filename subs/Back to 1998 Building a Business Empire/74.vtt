00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:01.400
Mr. Chen

2
00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:03.666
If you buy all our villas

3
00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:06.800
1.47 billion is needed.

4
00:00:07.366 --> 00:00:09.366
30% down payment.

5
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.033
It would take 490 million.

6
00:00:12.733 --> 00:00:15.733
A total of 3.70 million per month

7
00:00:15.733 --> 00:00:17.500
3.70 million

8
00:00:18.366 --> 00:00:20.500
So many things are a bit too much

9
00:00:20.566 --> 00:00:22.633
If you are stressed, you can buy less.

10
00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:24.766
It costs a little bit every month

11
00:00:28.666 --> 00:00:30.633
No problem, sign the contract

12
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:39.833
Oh, dear.

13
00:00:40.733 --> 00:00:42.400
I don't know if you two have time.

14
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:43.966
I'd like to treat you both to dinner

15
00:00:43.966 --> 00:00:45.466
Show my heart

16
00:00:46.333 --> 00:00:48.866
I appreciate your offer, but

17
00:00:49.133 --> 00:00:50.833
Next time, Chen Feng.

18
00:00:50.966 --> 00:00:52.633
How did you buy so many houses?

19
00:00:53.666 --> 00:00:55.166
The real estate market in the future?

20
00:00:55.166 --> 00:00:57.033
That was a blast.

21
00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:00.433
Properties like Xinyi

22
00:01:00.566 --> 00:01:02.766
Then the price must be rising

23
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.800
If you don't pick up cheap now, when will you pick up cheap?

24
00:01:06.166 --> 00:01:08.166
Mr. Chen, thank you today

25
00:01:08.166 --> 00:01:11.700
I would like to leave your mobile number, okay?

26
00:01:11.766 --> 00:01:13.366
Sorry about that.

27
00:01:13.466 --> 00:01:14.466
My Wife

28
00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:17.466
I don't want to leave someone else's phone number.

29
00:01:18.466 --> 00:01:19.366
Who's your wife?

30
00:01:19.366 --> 00:01:21.300
Don't be angry, who is it?
