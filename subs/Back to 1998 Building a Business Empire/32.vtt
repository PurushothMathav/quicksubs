00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.966
It seems that it will take a hard move.

2
00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:07.800
What did you do?

3
00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.400
Why did the stock fall again?

4
00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:11.266
I can't bear the child, I can't catch the wolf

5
00:00:11.333 --> 00:00:12.966
Scare them again

6
00:00:13.066 --> 00:00:15.666
The big fish will bite

7
00:00:15.666 --> 00:00:16.733
Then you let it out

8
00:00:16.733 --> 00:00:19.100
Aren't these stocks gone again?

9
00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:21.566
It's okay, I've already told Manager Gao.

10
00:00:21.566 --> 00:00:23.266
As long as it's the stock I put out

11
00:00:23.266 --> 00:00:26.033
He will have people buy it in the form of retail investors

12
00:00:26.933 --> 00:00:27.933
In that case

13
00:00:27.933 --> 00:00:29.266
Ultimate control

14
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:31.100
It's still in our hands.

15
00:00:31.666 --> 00:00:32.466
smart

16
00:00:33.266 --> 00:00:37.566
Hey, how nice it would be if my daughter knew you earlier

17
00:00:37.566 --> 00:00:39.700
Dad, what did you say?

18
00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:41.600
Look at this

19
00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.900
How did this start to fall?

20
00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:45.900
It has dropped to 6 yuan

21
00:00:45.933 --> 00:00:48.000
Don't throw it away for what?

22
00:00:48.166 --> 00:00:50.800
It also stimulates Brother Liu, let's cut the meat

23
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.066
Cut the meat, shut up

24
00:00:52.966 --> 00:00:54.433
It's all contracting opportunities

25
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:55.300
Liu Chao

26
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.300
I beg you.

27
00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:58.800
All my money is in your head

28
00:00:58.800 --> 00:00:59.933
Sell it now

29
00:00:59.933 --> 00:01:01.566
You're a coward

30
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.400
Damn I have money

31
00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.466
But who the hell can consume who?

32
00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.366
Oops, if you don't sell it, I'll kill you.
