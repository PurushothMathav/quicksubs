00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.600
The biggest problem is that it cannot be achieved

2
00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:04.166
Your example is right.

3
00:00:04.166 --> 00:00:05.400
Non-Q has been running for a year

4
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.200
So far, there is no profit of a dime.

5
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.766
All internet companies in this era

6
00:00:09.766 --> 00:00:11.333
Everything I know is not profitable.

7
00:00:11.333 --> 00:00:12.400
This question

8
00:00:12.466 --> 00:00:14.466
I don't know how to do that.

9
00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:16.666
Wait until you sign with me

10
00:00:16.666 --> 00:00:18.433
I will naturally tell you

11
00:00:18.533 --> 00:00:21.500
How much are you willing to invest?

12
00:00:23.533 --> 00:00:24.600
1 million

13
00:00:25.266 --> 00:00:26.900
10 million a billion

14
00:00:26.966 --> 00:00:29.500
What a billion

15
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:31.200
Why is there a problem?

16
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.533
No, I am very willing to accept your investment.

17
00:00:33.533 --> 00:00:34.500
I hope you

18
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.333
Can work with me to make the best technology

19
00:00:36.333 --> 00:00:37.166
Classmate question

20
00:00:37.266 --> 00:00:39.000
Then you misunderstood me.

21
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.366
I am only responsible for investing

22
00:00:40.366 --> 00:00:42.100
Does not participate in your joint management

23
00:00:42.266 --> 00:00:45.266
You are not involved in the management

24
00:00:45.533 --> 00:00:47.166
But I have a request.

25
00:00:47.166 --> 00:00:48.500
I invested 500 million

26
00:00:48.733 --> 00:00:51.500
You are not to leave this company for five years

27
00:00:52.066 --> 00:00:53.666
OK, I'll sign it.
