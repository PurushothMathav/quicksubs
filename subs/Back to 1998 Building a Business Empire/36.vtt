00:00:00.766 --> 00:00:02.300
What are you talking about?

2
00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:04.466
Who are you?

3
00:00:04.766 --> 00:00:06.933
Even if I jump off this building

4
00:00:06.933 --> 00:00:08.900
You won't regret it.

5
00:00:11.766 --> 00:00:13.166
Hello Manager Gao

6
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.100
Help me buy shares of Longtai Group

7
00:00:16.133 --> 00:00:17.366
How much do you want to buy?

8
00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.566
My bank balance is now 100 million

9
00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.666
Plus a loan of 100 million

10
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.800
Why don't you buy it?

11
00:00:24.733 --> 00:00:26.700
Chengfeng, did you arrange it?

12
00:00:26.733 --> 00:00:28.300
You're taking too much risk.

13
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:30.466
As far as I know

14
00:00:30.466 --> 00:00:33.800
Our country is negotiating with a country to join WT

15
00:00:34.266 --> 00:00:36.500
It should become famous in a few days

16
00:00:37.133 --> 00:00:38.400
As expected

17
00:00:38.666 --> 00:00:41.600
Once you have successfully joined Longtai Group's stock

18
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.466
At least 3 times the salary

19
00:00:43.466 --> 00:00:46.000
You fart and you're going bankrupt

20
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.600
How can the company continue to rise?

21
00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.500
It's up, Longtai's stock's up, show me

22
00:00:53.133 --> 00:00:55.766
The price went from three to 12.

23
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.366
It has quadrupled and is still rising

24
00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.100
Brother, please

25
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.833
Give me a break.

26
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.400
We are all short-sighted little people.

27
00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.233
Don't you want to know us in general?

28
00:01:13.333 --> 00:01:15.566
Hmph, I don't have you as a brother.

29
00:01:15.933 --> 00:01:19.866
Companies today are avant-garde.

30
00:01:20.166 --> 00:01:21.700
As long as you can be the third uncle

31
00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.700
I can do anything in the company.

32
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.633
Fine. Then you go to the door.
