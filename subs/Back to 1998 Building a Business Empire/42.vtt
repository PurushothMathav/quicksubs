1
00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:02.566
Since Mr. Xu doesn't believe me so much

2
00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:04.000
Then make a bet with me

3
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:05.466
What to bet

4
00:00:05.466 --> 00:00:07.600
I bet your company will go bankrupt tomorrow

5
00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.500
You damn curse me not to mention it

6
00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:12.366
If your company doesn't go bankrupt tomorrow

7
00:00:12.766 --> 00:00:15.233
I will directly compensate you 100 million in cash.

8
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.433
Mr. Cheng is fully responsible for my good discipline

9
00:00:20.766 --> 00:00:23.166
Why are you kidding him?

10
00:00:23.166 --> 00:00:24.766
I'm not kidding.

11
00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:26.000
Manager Gao?

12
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Help me make an appointment for your 100 million in cash

13
00:00:28.766 --> 00:00:32.466
If you go to Gongzi's company tomorrow, it will not go bankrupt.

14
00:00:32.733 --> 00:00:35.966
All this 100 million cash will be given to the son.

15
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.000
By no means the same

16
00:00:37.066 --> 00:00:38.200
Ok Mr. Cheng

17
00:00:38.533 --> 00:00:39.600
I'll arrange it.

18
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.133
Good boy what you said

19
00:00:43.133 --> 00:00:44.966
My company can't go out of business

20
00:00:44.966 --> 00:00:48.233
Just wait to lose, hahaha.

21
00:00:48.733 --> 00:00:51.600
Mr. Chen, why is this necessary?

22
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:52.600
Go to the dead

23
00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.366
I have my own arrangements

24
00:00:54.366 --> 00:00:57.500
Just wait and see the results tomorrow.

25
00:00:59.933 --> 00:01:02.266
Well, it's Mr. Cheng

26
00:01:02.566 --> 00:01:05.100
Mr. Cheng, take a look

27
00:01:05.533 --> 00:01:07.400
The bad debts of Dongguan Financial Company have been exposed

28
00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.300
Now all financial companies can't borrow money.

29
00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.433
There's already a big financial crisis.

30
00:01:11.866 --> 00:01:14.066
Mr. Cheng, you are too busy

31
00:01:16.366 --> 00:01:17.566
I just can't figure it out

32
00:01:17.566 --> 00:01:19.900
How did this come out?

33
00:01:22.133 --> 00:01:25.200
Guess how the reporter found out

34
00:01:30.566 --> 00:01:32.500
How did the reporter find out?
