00:00:00.666 --> 00:00:03.166
Longtai Airways stock is now 20,000

2
00:00:03.533 --> 00:00:04.866
As long as I do it

3
00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:06.433
Bulk goods on the market

4
00:00:06.866 --> 00:00:08.100
Will definitely sell

5
00:00:08.166 --> 00:00:10.000
It's already 30%, dad

6
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.233
Retail investors are selling

7
00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:13.100
Thought my estimate wouldn't last long

8
00:00:13.866 --> 00:00:14.666
about

9
00:00:15.866 --> 00:00:17.166
Will be hooked

10
00:00:17.166 --> 00:00:19.800
It went up, it came back.

11
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.300
Great! Looks like I'm about to have hope.

12
00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:23.700
It has now risen to 10 yuan

13
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:25.133
Retail investors have already run away

14
00:00:25.133 --> 00:00:27.500
Liu Shao, why don't we cut the meat and sell it?

15
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.400
Not for sale, the castle is 20 yuan

16
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.466
Wait, don't wait.

17
00:00:31.466 --> 00:00:32.466
This is a terrorist incident

18
00:00:32.466 --> 00:00:33.966
They disrupted airlines around the world.

19
00:00:34.166 --> 00:00:35.100
Let's wait.

20
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.766
I'm afraid it's going to become a junk stock

21
00:00:36.766 --> 00:00:39.600
No, this must be a damn successful plan

22
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.466
He will definitely be controlled by us and not prepared

23
00:00:44.166 --> 00:00:45.166
Something's wrong.

24
00:00:45.166 --> 00:00:47.966
Why has it been stuck at 30% for so long?

25
00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:49.900
Could it be that someone is making trouble?

26
00:00:49.966 --> 00:00:51.700
Looks like it's going to be tough
