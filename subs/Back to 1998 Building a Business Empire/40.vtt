00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.000
Why did Brother Chen reach this conclusion?

2
00:00:03.266 --> 00:00:06.466
The East Coast does have a large number of combined companies

3
00:00:07.266 --> 00:00:10.100
Although it has been said that the house price has been rising again

4
00:00:10.333 --> 00:00:11.566
But there is a risk

5
00:00:11.566 --> 00:00:13.300
I don't know if you've noticed.

6
00:00:13.933 --> 00:00:14.900
What risk?

7
00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:15.700
As far as I know.

8
00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:18.400
Financial companies like this are mostly leather companies

9
00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.833
Uh, pay off

10
00:00:20.866 --> 00:00:23.566
It has already arrived at the land of funds

11
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.066
It's true.

12
00:00:26.266 --> 00:00:28.100
As far as I know, this does exist.

13
00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:30.166
But these are very few

14
00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.333
It's just not the time yet.

15
00:00:32.333 --> 00:00:34.133
Until they can't borrow any more money

16
00:00:34.133 --> 00:00:35.466
A chain reaction will occur

17
00:00:35.466 --> 00:00:36.066
At that time

18
00:00:36.066 --> 00:00:38.700
There are bound to be all kinds of financial crises

19
00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:40.233
This time

20
00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.300
Then the price on the east coast must be ruined

21
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.866
Mr. Chen, the east coast

22
00:00:46.566 --> 00:00:47.900
There is no way to buy it.

23
00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:50.000
The east is not bright, let's light up the west.

24
00:00:50.333 --> 00:00:52.266
Now it's just right

25
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.233
It constitutes a large number of West Bank maps

26
00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.766
But the west coast is deserted.

27
00:00:59.966 --> 00:01:01.600
When can I turn over?

28
00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:02.800
It doesn't matter.

29
00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.833
There are several universities in Xi'an

30
00:01:04.966 --> 00:01:06.300
In a few years

31
00:01:06.366 --> 00:01:09.466
Educational resources like this are going to be available over time.

32
00:01:09.966 --> 00:01:11.666
If you believe me

33
00:01:11.866 --> 00:01:13.833
Come and invest in Xi'an with me

34
00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.200
I promise that you will make money and touch me.

35
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:20.900
What dare to lie to my dad?
