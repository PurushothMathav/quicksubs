00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:00.766
Mr. Chen

2
00:00:00.766 --> 00:00:02.700
Excuse me, you have won 28 consecutive Champions League scores.

3
00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.000
Is there a trick?

4
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.766
Haha, is this this?

5
00:00:05.766 --> 00:00:08.566
The main thing is perseverance

6
00:00:08.566 --> 00:00:10.466
And a little bit of luck

7
00:00:10.666 --> 00:00:12.200
Um no no no no no

8
00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.533
Mostly luck, mostly a little bit of luck

9
00:00:14.533 --> 00:00:15.666
It's a gambler's possession

10
00:00:15.666 --> 00:00:17.700
God than Zhou Runfa

11
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:20.800
Just buy a villa with my brother Cheng and rely on the sea

12
00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:23.966
Thanks to my last life I was a huge fan

13
00:00:24.066 --> 00:00:26.633
I remember every game vividly

14
00:00:27.933 --> 00:00:29.166
Mr. Cheng won so much money

15
00:00:29.166 --> 00:00:30.800
So what's next?

16
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.033
Next step, I'm ready

17
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.733
Mr. Chen, I am entrusted by the president of the bank of the Commercial Office

18
00:00:42.733 --> 00:00:44.500
I specially came here to send you Wuxing VIP.

19
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:45.900
Customer exclusive black gold card

20
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.066
Thank you, please.

21
00:00:48.066 --> 00:00:48.766
Thanks to you too

22
00:00:48.766 --> 00:00:51.100
This time I have a chance to turn around

23
00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:52.066
That's right.

24
00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:53.633
So I decided.

25
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.266
Hire Manager Xu as my exclusive financial advisor

26
00:00:57.266 --> 00:01:00.133
From now on, all my money will be deposited in commercial banks

27
00:01:00.133 --> 00:01:03.666
I said I would repay you well

28
00:01:05.133 --> 00:01:08.866
Brother, look, he actually hit 28 times in a row just now

29
00:01:08.866 --> 00:01:10.500
And the award is as high as 1 million

30
00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:11.800
What's going on here?

31
00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.700
Don't keep that in mind.

32
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:15.666
I'll tell you what.

33
00:01:15.666 --> 00:01:19.166
This loser's never gonna make 1 million

34
00:01:19.166 --> 00:01:20.900
I want to make money these days

35
00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:22.233
You have to mock

36
00:01:22.533 --> 00:01:23.700
You're right.

37
00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.766
How can that trash compare to Brother Liu?

38
00:01:27.266 --> 00:01:29.366
Luo Ge, can you teach me how to trade stocks?

39
00:01:29.366 --> 00:01:32.033
Oh, don't worry.

40
00:01:32.066 --> 00:01:33.200
Follow me!

41
00:01:33.566 --> 00:01:35.366
If only you were popular

42
00:01:35.533 --> 00:01:38.500
Excuse me, I would like to ask you to do me one more favor.

43
00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.033
What did you say?

44
00:01:40.133 --> 00:01:41.366
Open an account for me.

45
00:01:41.666 --> 00:01:42.600
I want to trade stocks
