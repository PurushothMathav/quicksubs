00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:02.300
It's you, dead old woman

2
00:00:02.366 --> 00:00:03.166
I'll tell you what.

3
00:00:03.166 --> 00:00:04.700
If my son had a three-fight two-fight

4
00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:06.233
I can't spare you.

5
00:00:06.566 --> 00:00:09.533
No, no, it's not me, he ran here by himself

6
00:00:09.533 --> 00:00:11.466
You immortal

7
00:00:11.466 --> 00:00:13.466
Why didn't you die sooner?

8
00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:15.533
If you hadn't been in the hospital bed

9
00:00:15.533 --> 00:00:17.400
How could I divorce Chunfeng?

10
00:00:17.966 --> 00:00:19.966
If it weren't for the divorce?

11
00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.433
I am also a wealthy woman now

12
00:00:23.066 --> 00:00:23.866
To cancel

13
00:00:24.966 --> 00:00:26.500
Dad, what do you want to do?

14
00:00:27.766 --> 00:00:28.766
You came just in time

15
00:00:28.766 --> 00:00:31.133
I'm telling you, your mother ran over my son

16
00:00:31.133 --> 00:00:32.266
What do you say?

17
00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.000
What do you want to do?

18
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.833
My son was hit so hard

19
00:00:35.933 --> 00:00:38.633
Lions have been eating for at least 100 years.

20
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:39.700
I'll tell you what.

21
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.600
I've had a hard time with you for three years

22
00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.700
You make some money now, shouldn't you give me some?

23
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.433
Why should I give it to you?

24
00:00:51.933 --> 00:00:52.766
I advise you.

25
00:00:52.766 --> 00:00:54.666
Let's stop daydreaming.

26
00:00:54.666 --> 00:00:55.466
Hey no

27
00:00:56.166 --> 00:00:58.966
Didn't you catch up with that Liu Yaoyang?

28
00:00:58.966 --> 00:01:01.433
Why didn't he give you the money?

29
00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:02.900
How is that possible?

30
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.800
Of course Liu Shao gave me money

31
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.366
And he has promised me.

32
00:01:07.366 --> 00:01:09.400
He wants to give me the best house to live in

33
00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.566
We're getting married soon

34
00:01:11.566 --> 00:01:13.800
Then you must seize this opportunity

35
00:01:14.466 --> 00:01:16.400
After all, follow him

36
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.800
Not a few good days

37
00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.766
What do you mean? You curse me

38
00:01:21.066 --> 00:01:22.200
Not a curse

39
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.233
Is advice

40
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:27.200
Multiple Injustice

41
00:01:27.533 --> 00:01:29.566
You must do it yourself

42
00:01:30.366 --> 00:01:31.366
You wait for me.

43
00:01:31.366 --> 00:01:32.600
I can't stand you.
