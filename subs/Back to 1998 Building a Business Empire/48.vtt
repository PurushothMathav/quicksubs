00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.766
Former founder of the mall Liu Dongqiang

2
00:00:03.166 --> 00:00:04.900
Chen Fang, what's wrong with you?

3
00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:06.766
That person just now was not simple.

4
00:00:06.866 --> 00:00:09.366
The future is sure to achieve great things

5
00:00:09.366 --> 00:00:10.566
See what you have.

6
00:00:12.766 --> 00:00:14.366
People can't look good

7
00:00:14.366 --> 00:00:17.633
The seawater is immeasurable, so good

8
00:00:18.133 --> 00:00:20.666
After 20 years, I became his slave

9
00:00:21.066 --> 00:00:23.133
When the Tokyo mall is listed

10
00:00:23.133 --> 00:00:24.466
trillion market cap

11
00:00:24.466 --> 00:00:25.533
100 billion net worth

12
00:00:25.533 --> 00:00:26.666
Turn life into cloud

13
00:00:26.666 --> 00:00:27.766
Happiness and longevity are only

14
00:00:29.466 --> 00:00:30.666
Happy to think about it

15
00:00:30.933 --> 00:00:33.800
Oh god

16
00:00:33.866 --> 00:00:34.800
That Liu Yaoyang

17
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.633
Why Zhang Haiyi over and over again

18
00:00:37.266 --> 00:00:38.900
A thief's heart never dies

19
00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:43.066
It seems that he has to give him some color to see

20
00:00:45.933 --> 00:00:46.766
Hello Manager Liu

21
00:00:47.566 --> 00:00:48.900
Get me 2 billion

22
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.666
I want to short Liu's Group

23
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.733
By the way, help me put the word out.

24
00:00:52.733 --> 00:00:55.766
Just say Liu Yaoyang, the son of the Liu Group

25
00:00:55.766 --> 00:00:56.833
investment failure

26
00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.233
default

27
00:01:05.066 --> 00:01:06.600
You rubbish

28
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.766
How dare you embezzle company money?

29
00:01:09.766 --> 00:01:11.700
Go out and invest

30
00:01:11.766 --> 00:01:14.333
If I hadn't seen it in the newspaper

31
00:01:14.333 --> 00:01:17.566
I'm still in the service

32
00:01:17.566 --> 00:01:18.366
Dad?

33
00:01:19.066 --> 00:01:21.500
It's all charges, that bastard used it for me behind my back

34
00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:22.300
put

35
00:01:22.766 --> 00:01:24.266
I can't swallow this breath

36
00:01:24.333 --> 00:01:27.833
Damn all this stuff

37
00:01:27.866 --> 00:01:30.000
If you are wrong, admit it.

38
00:01:30.466 --> 00:01:32.866
Reflect on being beaten

39
00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:34.966
Kneel down for me

40
00:01:35.766 --> 00:01:36.900
kneel down

41
00:01:40.066 --> 00:01:43.266
You give me a good kneel on these three lines of opposite feet

42
00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:47.466
Ugly Eight

43
00:01:48.533 --> 00:01:50.100
I fuck you
