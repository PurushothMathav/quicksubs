00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.466
I checked

2
00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:04.000
Your father and grandfather were farmers

3
00:00:04.133 --> 00:00:06.300
There is a small courtyard in the countryside

4
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:07.733
That's all your assets.

5
00:00:07.733 --> 00:00:09.500
Dad, what did you say?

6
00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:11.166
Chen Feng, he is our man

7
00:00:11.166 --> 00:00:14.266
And after you divorced your ex-wife

8
00:00:14.266 --> 00:00:15.800
Just with my daughter

9
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.933
A responsible man like you

10
00:00:17.933 --> 00:00:19.666
I wouldn't be with my daughter

11
00:00:19.666 --> 00:00:22.300
Dissatisfied about my parents

12
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:23.566
You checked it right.

13
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.166
I am indeed the son of a farmer

14
00:00:25.166 --> 00:00:26.466
But I don't steal or rob

15
00:00:26.466 --> 00:00:28.266
I earned everything I could

16
00:00:28.266 --> 00:00:29.800
Be worthy of the conscience of heaven and earth

17
00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.166
About my ex-wife

18
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.566
One is that he betrayed me first

19
00:00:33.566 --> 00:00:36.233
The second is also the divorce he initiated

20
00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.666
I didn't feel sorry for him from start to finish.

21
00:00:38.666 --> 00:00:40.733
Dad, Chen Feng is a good man

22
00:00:40.733 --> 00:00:42.800
He's not what you said. Shut up

23
00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.066
Why aren't you with him?

24
00:00:45.066 --> 00:00:47.433
Dad, it just doesn't work

25
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.300
I have betrothed you to the Zhao family

26
00:00:50.566 --> 00:00:53.300
Dad, how could you do that?

27
00:00:54.466 --> 00:00:56.100
Sorry dad

28
00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.466
There's a turnover problem between your companies

29
00:00:59.566 --> 00:01:01.100
Only by marrying the Zhao family

30
00:01:01.866 --> 00:01:03.900
Save your company from fire and water

31
00:01:04.666 --> 00:01:06.100
What should I do with Chen Fang?

32
00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.866
Uncle, I have a way to do this

33
00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:10.400
What can you do?

34
00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.200
If I'm not mistaken

35
00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:13.566
Pay your salary

36
00:01:13.566 --> 00:01:15.166
Is there a

37
00:01:15.166 --> 00:01:16.700
Cooperation project with Chaoyin

38
00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:19.166
This is a high-level decision project

39
00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:20.833
How do you know?
