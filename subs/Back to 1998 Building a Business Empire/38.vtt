00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.900
Village Chief Xu will introduce to you

2
00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:03.966
This is Mr. Chengfeng

3
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.033
Thank you for your appreciation.

4
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:09.633
Brother Cheng is really young

5
00:00:09.933 --> 00:00:12.800
How could there be such a competitive investment vision?

6
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.800
It's very impressive.

7
00:00:14.966 --> 00:00:16.400
It's a natural leap.

8
00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.966
I am also more than average

9
00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:20.300
A little lucky

10
00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.633
Making 20,000 to 30,000 at a time might be called luck

11
00:00:23.666 --> 00:00:25.866
But earning 300 million at a time

12
00:00:26.366 --> 00:00:29.900
Well, it's not a matter of luck, is it?

13
00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.366
Hahahahaha enough

14
00:00:32.366 --> 00:00:33.466
Is it really enough?

15
00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:34.600
Brother Chen?

16
00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.866
Well, what's the place to get rich in the future?

17
00:00:39.333 --> 00:00:42.566
Can you tell us a thing or two?

18
00:00:42.566 --> 00:00:44.033
Talk about investing.

19
00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:46.700
So far

20
00:00:46.966 --> 00:00:49.400
Only real estate is the most suitable

21
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:50.233
real estate

22
00:00:50.866 --> 00:00:52.666
Real estate real estate

23
00:00:52.766 --> 00:00:56.066
Real estate listens to our strengths

24
00:00:56.333 --> 00:00:57.833
We want to do real estate

25
00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:58.833
I'm afraid it will change too

26
00:01:00.133 --> 00:01:02.200
overwhelmed

27
00:01:05.766 --> 00:01:07.033
Go to the deputy head to visit

28
00:01:11.266 --> 00:01:13.066
Our high-rise buildings in Jiangcheng

29
00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.866
Mainly distributed on this side of the new city

30
00:01:16.133 --> 00:01:19.466
And the old town and the inside of the outer ring

31
00:01:19.666 --> 00:01:21.666
It's almost impossible.

32
00:01:21.866 --> 00:01:25.366
So as long as we can take this piece of land

33
00:01:25.666 --> 00:01:29.866
Then from now on, we just have to wait for the promotion

34
00:01:30.466 --> 00:01:32.700
But buying this kind of land

35
00:01:32.766 --> 00:01:34.566
It's easier said than done to make money

36
00:01:34.566 --> 00:01:36.900
If you bid for a piece of land, it will cost hundreds of millions.

37
00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.166
It's hard to see a return for more than a decade

38
00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:40.166
and

39
00:01:40.566 --> 00:01:43.300
How do we know where to put our money?

40
00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:46.633
It depends on whether you are willing to be with me or not

41
00:01:48.133 --> 00:01:49.100
Take a gamble
