00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:01.500
I bet you 1 million

2
00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:03.133
Hahahaha

3
00:00:03.133 --> 00:00:06.033
Are you so fucking stupid?

4
00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.600
1 million to buy

5
00:00:08.666 --> 00:00:12.100
Don't you know that international money has affected Hong Kong bones?

6
00:00:12.533 --> 00:00:15.200
Chen Feng, if you don't understand stocks, don't talk nonsense

7
00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.366
Now the whole market is a buyer of Hang Seng.

8
00:00:17.366 --> 00:00:18.866
It's impossible to fall

9
00:00:18.866 --> 00:00:20.400
It's even less likely to fall to 2,000

10
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.366
Even I'm not afraid to tell you

11
00:00:24.066 --> 00:00:25.566
Our brother Liu's uncle

12
00:00:25.566 --> 00:00:28.133
Is the general manager of a listed company

13
00:00:28.133 --> 00:00:29.900
Is it long or father?

14
00:00:31.766 --> 00:00:35.033
Excuse me, is today Thursday, August 5th?

15
00:00:35.266 --> 00:00:36.000
Yes!

16
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.366
What's the matter, why do you suddenly ask this?

17
00:00:38.366 --> 00:00:39.466
That's right.

18
00:00:39.466 --> 00:00:42.366
On this day in history, the Asian financial crisis broke out.

19
00:00:42.366 --> 00:00:45.866
At 1:15 p.m., the stock market crashed and fell by the limit

20
00:00:45.933 --> 00:00:47.233
10 minutes left

21
00:00:47.966 --> 00:00:50.266
Why don't you dare to speak?

22
00:00:50.266 --> 00:00:51.300
I'll tell you what.

23
00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.866
Waste requires self-awareness

24
00:00:52.866 --> 00:00:55.600
I advise you to go home and farm now before it's too late

25
00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:56.533
Dusty

26
00:00:56.533 --> 00:00:58.800
Is your aunt sick? You are too stressed.

27
00:00:58.800 --> 00:00:59.966
I'll take you to rest

28
00:00:59.966 --> 00:01:01.366
Too late to explain the avant-garde

29
00:01:01.366 --> 00:01:02.800
This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

30
00:01:02.933 --> 00:01:04.000
Buy it for me

31
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.700
Ok, I'll help you.

32
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.333
Chen Feng 1 million buy it all

33
00:01:10.333 --> 00:01:12.066
Hengsheng pointed out that the falling pavilion needs to be confirmed?

34
00:01:12.066 --> 00:01:12.866
confirm

35
00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:14.800
You are so fucking

36
00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:16.800
I know it's a sea of fire and dare to jump in it

37
00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.500
Today I will see how you die

38
00:01:18.566 --> 00:01:19.366
Liu Shao

39
00:01:19.966 --> 00:01:21.900
Dare to bet bigger?

40
00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.433
I want to increase leverage by 10 million

41
00:01:24.566 --> 00:01:26.500
Chen Feng, are you crazy?

42
00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:27.700
If the 10 million is lost

43
00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:29.266
Your life will be ruined

44
00:01:29.266 --> 00:01:31.466
Keep your eyes peeled at the referee

45
00:01:31.466 --> 00:01:34.200
The Red Army has now risen to 10,900.

46
00:01:34.366 --> 00:01:36.200
100 points away from the daily limit

47
00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.500
You tell me how to drop it.

48
00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.700
Dusty Wenwu is still in the hospital

49
00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:40.933
Even if you don't think about yourself

50
00:01:40.933 --> 00:01:43.066
You can't drag down the museum to go on an adventure

51
00:01:45.333 --> 00:01:46.766
No time to explain, Rose

52
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.100
You trust me.

53
00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:49.466
I won't lose

54
00:01:51.266 --> 00:01:54.166
I beg you, don't risk buying it.

55
00:01:54.166 --> 00:01:56.266
Give me more 1 million buy the limit

56
00:01:56.266 --> 00:01:58.966
Changfang, you have the ability to buy another 10 million

57
00:01:58.966 --> 00:02:00.066
One more minute.

58
00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:01.666
Can't take so much
