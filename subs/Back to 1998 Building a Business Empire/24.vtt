00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:02.200
Chen Fang thanks to you this time

2
00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:04.300
Otherwise the school may be demolished

3
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.366
What do you mean?

4
00:00:06.533 --> 00:00:07.466
You have helped me so much.

5
00:00:07.466 --> 00:00:08.800
Is this appropriate?

6
00:00:10.333 --> 00:00:13.166
Hey, do you have time on weekends?

7
00:00:13.166 --> 00:00:14.633
Can you accompany me home?

8
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.433
Are you going to see your parents so soon?

9
00:00:19.766 --> 00:00:21.700
I'm not ready yet.

10
00:00:22.166 --> 00:00:23.700
What are you talking about?

11
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.866
There has been a problem with my house recently.

12
00:00:26.866 --> 00:00:28.833
I would like you to help me go back and have a look.

13
00:00:29.533 --> 00:00:30.333
Oh.

14
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.766
And what does your family do?

15
00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:34.900
My father is the chairperson of Longpai Airlines

16
00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:36.666
Mainly American Airlines

17
00:00:37.166 --> 00:00:40.033
It's 911 next month

18
00:00:40.166 --> 00:00:41.500
Go on like this

19
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:42.700
Sooner or later it will go bankrupt

20
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.633
What? Don't you want to?

21
00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:47.166
Oh, no, no, no.

22
00:00:47.333 --> 00:00:49.466
How could I not want to?

23
00:00:49.466 --> 00:00:52.300
After all, we are classmates

24
00:00:52.566 --> 00:00:54.866
It is also necessary to help each other.

25
00:00:54.866 --> 00:00:56.666
Who said it's just a classmate relationship?

26
00:00:57.766 --> 00:01:01.000
Aren't you a classmate?

27
00:01:01.133 --> 00:01:02.566
Oops you know

28
00:01:03.366 --> 00:01:04.633
I'm not going to talk to you anymore.

29
00:01:04.666 --> 00:01:06.833
You can go. Okay.

30
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.433
Sit down, let's go

31
00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.300
This is really going to meet your father's wife

32
00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:21.500
I'm sure I'm a little nervous

33
00:01:22.566 --> 00:01:24.766
No, my dad is a nice guy

34
00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.466
Dad, let me introduce a friend to you to meet Chen Feng

35
00:01:28.466 --> 00:01:29.533
He is awesome!

36
00:01:29.533 --> 00:01:30.900
Exceptionally good at investing

37
00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.633
He wants to communicate with you. Stay away from my daughter.

38
00:01:34.266 --> 00:01:35.800
Dad, what did you say?
