00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:02.500
It seems that the lesson taught you last time was not enough, right?

2
00:00:02.966 --> 00:00:04.400
You remember me.

3
00:00:04.566 --> 00:00:06.466
As long as I'm there

4
00:00:06.566 --> 00:00:08.266
Don't even think about parking

5
00:00:08.966 --> 00:00:11.300
You wait for me. Go.

6
00:00:11.933 --> 00:00:12.733
Chen Fang

7
00:00:12.766 --> 00:00:15.133
I heard that the whole family has a good relationship

8
00:00:15.133 --> 00:00:17.966
This time the punishment is not more than that simple, it's alright

9
00:00:17.966 --> 00:00:18.966
I know the answer.

10
00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:21.366
Hey, do you have this map in your car?

11
00:00:21.366 --> 00:00:22.700
Yes, I'll get it for you.

12
00:00:26.366 --> 00:00:28.700
Commander, I signed 20 drug enemy contracts

13
00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:29.800
Dante can't take it?

14
00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.666
Otherwise, the 40 dolls will not learn.

15
00:00:31.666 --> 00:00:33.800
How much is a broken school worth?

16
00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.800
Anyway, the village decided it was up to the board

17
00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.566
Or you can buy it if you can

18
00:00:39.566 --> 00:00:40.666
Otherwise no talk

19
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.133
Mr. Liu, I once raised my hand

20
00:00:43.133 --> 00:00:44.233
Dante can't take it

21
00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:48.433
This is my heart.

22
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.533
Are you fucking sending beggars?

23
00:00:53.533 --> 00:00:55.000
I'm the one telling you.

24
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.400
We are sick in your place.

25
00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.366
You'd better pack up and go back

26
00:01:00.366 --> 00:01:02.266
You can't take it, you can't take it.

27
00:01:02.333 --> 00:01:04.066
Well, you don't have to accept it.

28
00:01:04.066 --> 00:01:06.333
You kneel down now and kowtow to me ten times

29
00:01:06.333 --> 00:01:09.100
I'll consider keeping your broken school

30
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.966
Okay, I do.

31
00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:13.500
I knock
