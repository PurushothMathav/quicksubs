00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:03.400
Please go and say hello to Qu Zichang and the others first.

2
00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:06.500
I'm going to watch the football club, and the president will come to you in a while

3
00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:07.466
Yeah, OK.

4
00:00:10.266 --> 00:00:11.066
Excuse me.

5
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:12.666
Isn't this sorry?

6
00:00:12.666 --> 00:00:14.166
Why did you just come?

7
00:00:14.166 --> 00:00:15.766
I was delayed on the way.

8
00:00:15.766 --> 00:00:16.666
Oh, dear.

9
00:00:16.866 --> 00:00:19.700
It's okay, it's okay, don't you have a car?

10
00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:22.566
It's normal to be late, hahaha.

11
00:00:22.566 --> 00:00:24.666
Don't use my side?

12
00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:25.866
Nobody knows, right?

13
00:00:25.866 --> 00:00:27.600
Cheng Feng divorced his wife

14
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.866
I've been having a hard time lately

15
00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:31.733
Hey, it just so happens that everyone is here today

16
00:00:31.733 --> 00:00:34.300
Why don't you do a fundraiser for Chengfeng?

17
00:00:34.733 --> 00:00:36.600
Why don't you take this opportunity today?

18
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.766
Learn from Zijun how to make money

19
00:00:38.766 --> 00:00:39.366
Zijun

20
00:00:39.366 --> 00:00:42.900
I just made 1 million and now I'm rich

21
00:00:43.166 --> 00:00:44.600
Don't say that. Don't say that

22
00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:45.766
Rich again

23
00:00:45.766 --> 00:00:47.466
Are we classmates too?

24
00:00:47.466 --> 00:00:49.966
Well, I'm buying this dinner today.

25
00:00:50.066 --> 00:00:51.433
Great Zijun

26
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:52.900
Just tell me

27
00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:54.933
How on earth did you become so rich?

28
00:00:54.933 --> 00:00:56.533
Hi, how about recently?

29
00:00:56.533 --> 00:00:57.900
I am speculating in futures

30
00:00:58.066 --> 00:01:01.200
Not everyone can operate this thing

31
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.700
So awesome

32
00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.866
Zijun, are you worthy of our classmates cutting like this?

33
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:06.800
return

34
00:01:07.133 --> 00:01:09.900
Chen Feng wants me to say that maybe you stutter too much

35
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.500
He has introduced you to another job.

36
00:01:13.066 --> 00:01:14.466
I don't need to look for a job

37
00:01:14.933 --> 00:01:16.700
I said ride the wind

38
00:01:16.733 --> 00:01:18.533
You are too old

39
00:01:18.533 --> 00:01:21.700
It's time to think about yourself and your family

40
00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.300
What difficulties do you have?

41
00:01:23.333 --> 00:01:24.300
Just tell me.

42
00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:25.633
I'll definitely help!

43
00:01:25.766 --> 00:01:28.466
Yeah, no wonder they got divorced.

44
00:01:28.466 --> 00:01:31.000
How can anyone dare to be with you like this?

45
00:01:31.533 --> 00:01:33.366
Sorry I'm late.
