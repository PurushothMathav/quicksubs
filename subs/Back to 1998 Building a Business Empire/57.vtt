00:00:02.766 --> 00:00:04.200
Why are you here?

2
00:00:06.066 --> 00:00:09.166
You copied it, do you want to do the opposite?

3
00:00:09.866 --> 00:00:10.766
take personal advantage

4
00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:12.266
Your people?

5
00:00:12.266 --> 00:00:14.300
Said my business license was fake

6
00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:16.866
He tore up my business license

7
00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.700
Mr. Chen surprised you

8
00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:21.633
I found out too late.

9
00:00:21.733 --> 00:00:24.566
How dare you!

10
00:00:24.566 --> 00:00:26.566
You tore up your business license

11
00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:27.900
Situ Shenbing

12
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.566
Somebody throw him out for me

13
00:00:30.566 --> 00:00:31.900
Go to the market to forgive me

14
00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:33.266
I don't care if I go to the market.

15
00:00:33.266 --> 00:00:35.500
He won't go to the market

16
00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:36.800
Go to the market!

17
00:00:37.933 --> 00:00:39.900
Mr. Chen, you have worked hard

18
00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:41.100
Director Xu

19
00:00:41.766 --> 00:00:42.900
Hey no

20
00:00:43.266 --> 00:00:44.566
Come and save me yourself

21
00:00:44.866 --> 00:00:47.266
Mr. Cheng saved Quanzi's life

22
00:00:47.266 --> 00:00:49.866
I've been careful with it

23
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.333
Old sister Mr. Cheng is off

24
00:00:52.333 --> 00:00:53.366
It's an honor.

25
00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.033
More than that, Director Qu

26
00:00:56.533 --> 00:01:00.100
As for the person, go and check this Liu Yangyang carefully.

27
00:01:00.766 --> 00:01:02.466
What the hell is going on?

28
00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.800
It's me, I'll check it out

29
00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.600
As long as I find out, I will endure them

30
00:01:09.366 --> 00:01:10.400
Hey spring breeze

31
00:01:10.533 --> 00:01:13.433
I got a text saying that Qu Sichang wants to invite you to dinner

32
00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.466
The Hyatt Regency downtown.

33
00:01:16.133 --> 00:01:19.200
It seems that there is something to ask for.

34
00:01:19.766 --> 00:01:22.033
You've had a lot of dinners lately

35
00:01:23.166 --> 00:01:25.066
We're just at the beginning of our journey.

36
00:01:25.066 --> 00:01:29.066
Isn't it a good thing to socialize more?
