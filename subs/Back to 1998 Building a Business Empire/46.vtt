00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:01.766
Give it to me, oops.

2
00:00:01.766 --> 00:00:03.366
You really fight

3
00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:04.566
Must stand apart

4
00:00:04.566 --> 00:00:05.366
i

5
00:00:05.666 --> 00:00:07.166
Last question.

6
00:00:07.366 --> 00:00:09.666
Let me ask one more strange thing.

7
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.500
Say who sent you

8
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.100
Liu Yaoyang

9
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:19.400
Right

10
00:00:20.266 --> 00:00:22.466
It's okay to let your tongue play

11
00:00:22.533 --> 00:00:24.566
It can also make you confused.

12
00:00:24.566 --> 00:00:27.766
Oh, confused, big brother, confused?

13
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.000
Then Liu Yaoyang is about to go bankrupt

14
00:00:32.166 --> 00:00:34.166
How can he give you money?

15
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.066
Who said that? We have a deposit

16
00:00:37.066 --> 00:00:39.600
How much is the deposit worth?

17
00:00:39.666 --> 00:00:40.600
You look like this

18
00:00:40.733 --> 00:00:43.600
You call him now to ask for the balance.

19
00:00:43.733 --> 00:00:45.600
See if he gives it to you.

20
00:00:47.133 --> 00:00:48.500
Hey, don't worry.

21
00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:49.666
I'm right here.

22
00:00:49.666 --> 00:00:52.833
Can't you cut me again? My car is broken, bro

23
00:00:52.966 --> 00:00:54.666
I understand what he said.

24
00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:56.200
If you lie to us, don't be afraid

25
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.866
Yes, the money to go home and marry a daughter-in-law will be gone again

26
00:01:01.266 --> 00:01:03.233
Wait, I'll make a call.

27
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.366
Hello, Li Weiwei?

28
00:01:07.466 --> 00:01:08.766
All of them have been killed by me.

29
00:01:08.766 --> 00:01:10.966
Great, Uncle Zhou

30
00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.466
You're finally fucking dead

31
00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:15.600
Call me the money

32
00:01:15.666 --> 00:01:17.966
Pay for the violation, what the hell is the violation?

33
00:01:20.466 --> 00:01:21.900
Hello

34
00:01:23.066 --> 00:01:24.100
Damn you

35
00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:28.100
You dare to lie to me, your brother, we are really deceived.
