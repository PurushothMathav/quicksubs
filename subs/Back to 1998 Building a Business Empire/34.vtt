00:00:02.133 --> 00:00:04.166
Third uncle and third sister, what are you doing?

2
00:00:04.166 --> 00:00:05.666
Have you seen the news?

3
00:00:05.733 --> 00:00:07.966
There was such a big emergency

4
00:00:07.966 --> 00:00:10.066
The company is going bankrupt

5
00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:12.066
Let your dad return the money to us

6
00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.100
Go back and pay me back

7
00:00:14.366 --> 00:00:18.100
Senior, your dad doesn't come forward about this matter

8
00:00:18.533 --> 00:00:20.200
Shouldn't they all be out?

9
00:00:20.466 --> 00:00:21.700
Third uncle is not

10
00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:23.266
Who am I kidding?

11
00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.200
The group is about to go bankrupt

12
00:00:25.566 --> 00:00:27.266
If we don't come again

13
00:00:27.566 --> 00:00:30.900
I'm afraid your dad is going to take the money away

14
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.200
Knowing that the company is going bankrupt, don't come to help

15
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.400
Ask for money in time

16
00:00:36.166 --> 00:00:37.300
So shameless

17
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.100
Who are you thinking about?

18
00:00:39.666 --> 00:00:41.100
It's our family business

19
00:00:41.166 --> 00:00:42.400
What does it have to do with you?

20
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.566
Third Uncle, our Chen Feng is here to help the company.

21
00:00:45.733 --> 00:00:48.733
Not like when your company lives and dies

22
00:00:48.733 --> 00:00:50.800
Still here asking us for money?

23
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.600
What's wrong with asking for money?

24
00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:55.166
We deserve this money.

25
00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.033
Your dad has made billions over the years

26
00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:59.866
I don't know. Give us some.

27
00:01:00.133 --> 00:01:01.900
Now the company is going bankrupt

28
00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:03.500
Deserved

29
00:01:03.566 --> 00:01:07.000
Third sister, if my father hadn't helped you back then

30
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.666
I'm afraid that small factory in your company

31
00:01:08.666 --> 00:01:10.066
Long ago closed down

32
00:01:10.733 --> 00:01:12.600
And your grandson

33
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:13.400
ask yourself

34
00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.200
Has my father treated you badly over the years?

35
00:01:16.866 --> 00:01:17.366
unexpected

36
00:01:17.366 --> 00:01:19.666
Now you're asking us for money here?

37
00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.133
No big or small, you dare to talk to me like that

38
00:01:22.133 --> 00:01:23.200
I see you are

39
00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:25.400
Dare to move thunder, right?
