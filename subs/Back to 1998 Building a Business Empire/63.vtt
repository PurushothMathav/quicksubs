1
00:00:00.666 --> 00:00:02.166
Dad, we're back.

2
00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:06.100
Oops, you just came by the wind, come and go, go and go

3
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.833
After our preliminary preparation with Mr. Gao

4
00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:14.400
Now the construction plan for the land in Xi'an has been finalized

5
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.200
Come and see me

6
00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.066
Well, I think it's great.

7
00:00:20.066 --> 00:00:22.166
Centered around the campus district in the city

8
00:00:22.366 --> 00:00:23.900
Make our own home base

9
00:00:24.166 --> 00:00:26.666
To establish our own supremacy

10
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.666
Then radiate to other surrounding areas

11
00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.233
According to this plan

12
00:00:33.333 --> 00:00:36.033
We probably need more than 6 billion

13
00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:36.900
6 billion

14
00:00:37.933 --> 00:00:39.100
But now.

15
00:00:39.466 --> 00:00:40.833
We Xu Group

16
00:00:41.066 --> 00:00:43.066
Only 1.3 billion can be funded

17
00:00:43.366 --> 00:00:45.666
Do you dare to make such a large sum of money?

18
00:00:45.666 --> 00:00:46.633
So be it.

19
00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:49.266
I will recommend a new way to play for you.

20
00:00:49.266 --> 00:00:50.400
How to play?

21
00:00:51.333 --> 00:00:52.800
Before we built the house.

22
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.066
You can pay part of the advance payment in advance.

23
00:00:55.066 --> 00:00:57.800
The rest let the urban construction party cushion

24
00:00:58.133 --> 00:00:59.500
Wait until it's built

25
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.900
Acceptance and customs clearance before payment

26
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.866
At this time?

27
00:01:02.866 --> 00:01:05.600
Our money is almost ruining us

28
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.133
Oh, that's a good idea.

29
00:01:07.133 --> 00:01:08.366
Of course, yeah.

30
00:01:08.366 --> 00:01:11.700
In the last life, this was a common way to play real estate

31
00:01:11.766 --> 00:01:15.300
Now don't blame me for using it early

32
00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:15.733
But

33
00:01:15.733 --> 00:01:17.666
Our funds are not before the house is built

34
00:01:17.666 --> 00:01:18.700
Isn't that enough?

35
00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.633
Don't worry, in fact, before the house is built

36
00:01:22.733 --> 00:01:26.266
We can do pre-sale and pre-sale first.
