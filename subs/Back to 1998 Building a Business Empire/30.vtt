00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.500
This luck is better

23
00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.000
Once or twice can unclog

24
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.533
You can guess three times in a row.

25
00:01:04.533 --> 00:01:05.933
You still say that you are not a god?

26
00:01:05.933 --> 00:01:07.766
Hey, the car is far away.

27
00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.566
