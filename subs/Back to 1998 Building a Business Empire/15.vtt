00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:01.800
Master Zhou what?

2
00:00:02.333 --> 00:00:02.933
Our teacher

3
00:00:02.933 --> 00:00:05.300
Teacher Sun, isn't that half a school on the front line?

4
00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:07.633
Now the village is going to forcibly take back the land for auction

5
00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:09.500
That's decades of hard work.

6
00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:11.800
There are still hundreds of children's school problems

7
00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:14.166
No, I can't ignore this.

8
00:00:14.533 --> 00:00:15.333
Obviously not

9
00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:16.566
Don't worry.

10
00:00:16.766 --> 00:00:19.033
I'll accompany you to see Dad

11
00:00:20.066 --> 00:00:21.800
Ah, good.

12
00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:22.833
There you go.

13
00:00:23.866 --> 00:00:26.566
The village chief only needs me to take a picture of this land

14
00:00:26.566 --> 00:00:28.500
I'll give you 100,000 back

15
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.166
Hahaha, it has to be Mr. Liu.

16
00:00:31.166 --> 00:00:32.400
Look so generous

17
00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.333
Don't worry, the villagers' meeting is all our people.

18
00:00:35.333 --> 00:00:37.333
Fully cooperate with you

19
00:00:37.333 --> 00:00:38.700
I'm busy first.

20
00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.166
Brother Liu, why did you give him so much?

21
00:00:41.166 --> 00:00:42.100
What the hell do you know?

22
00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:43.500
I have inside information

23
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.133
This land is about to build a highway

24
00:00:46.133 --> 00:00:48.400
At that time, it will be worth 10 times the value.

25
00:00:48.666 --> 00:00:51.100
I gave him 100,000 dollars to take the land

26
00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:53.466
I can make more than 5 million if I change hands

27
00:00:53.566 --> 00:00:55.000
What do you think of this business?

28
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.366
It has to be Brother Liu

29
00:00:56.366 --> 00:00:57.333
You remember to compensate

30
00:00:57.333 --> 00:00:59.133
I lost money in the stock market at that time

31
00:00:59.133 --> 00:01:01.100
I'll give you 1 million

32
00:01:02.133 --> 00:01:02.933
OK

33
00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:06.300
What the hell are you doing here?

34
00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:08.666
I heard there's a piece of land up for auction

35
00:01:08.966 --> 00:01:09.900
Come join in the fun

36
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.566
Ride the wind I tell you

37
00:01:11.566 --> 00:01:12.733
Don't think you are there

38
00:01:12.733 --> 00:01:14.266
Make two bad bucks in the stock market

39
00:01:14.266 --> 00:01:16.133
Buy a broken car and dare to exchange with me

40
00:01:16.133 --> 00:01:17.500
Across the battlefield

41
00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.500
Our family's relationship is hand-to-eye

42
00:01:20.566 --> 00:01:22.600
It seems that the lesson taught you last time was not enough, right?

43
00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:23.966
You remember me.

44
00:01:23.966 --> 00:01:25.866
As long as I'm there

45
00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:27.666
You don't even want to show up
