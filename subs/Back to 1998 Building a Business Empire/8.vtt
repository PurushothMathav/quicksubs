1
00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:01.033
Open an account for me.

2
00:00:01.366 --> 00:00:02.200
I want to trade stocks

3
00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:04.566
Why did you suddenly become interested in stocks?

4
00:00:04.566 --> 00:00:06.900
Because for the stock trading clients I contact

5
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:09.133
95% are at a loss

6
00:00:09.133 --> 00:00:11.400
Few people have made money from the stock market these years

7
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.666
It depends on individual talent

8
00:00:13.666 --> 00:00:15.733
Don't worry, I know

9
00:00:15.733 --> 00:00:16.533
All right.

10
00:00:16.733 --> 00:00:18.733
I'll introduce you to the general manager of the securities company

11
00:00:18.733 --> 00:00:19.633
executive bar

12
00:00:20.333 --> 00:00:22.466
Then thank Qiankun

13
00:00:28.333 --> 00:00:30.366
Brother Liu, I will listen to you

14
00:00:30.366 --> 00:00:33.200
I bought all the 80,000 dollars in my hand and grew it

15
00:00:33.566 --> 00:00:36.000
Can you promise me that you must make money?

16
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:36.866
Don't worry.

17
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:38.533
I threw 1 million

18
00:00:38.533 --> 00:00:41.766
Today my uncle is the general manager of a listed company

19
00:00:41.766 --> 00:00:43.666
Not only internal information

20
00:00:43.766 --> 00:00:47.466
And secretly manipulate the stock price with several major shareholders

21
00:00:47.466 --> 00:00:50.233
And as we go up to 11,000 years.

22
00:00:50.266 --> 00:00:51.833
We throw it out.

23
00:00:51.866 --> 00:00:53.266
We'll catch him then.

24
00:00:53.466 --> 00:00:55.100
Hahahahaha

25
00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.166
That's great, Brother Chen

26
00:00:57.166 --> 00:00:59.633
Why is this lubricated iced tea?

27
00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:02.800
Why is it you again?

28
00:01:03.566 --> 00:01:05.300
Follow my butt all day

29
00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:06.800
I will not remarry you

30
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.766
Who is going to remarry you?

31
00:01:08.766 --> 00:01:10.400
A bitch like you

32
00:01:10.466 --> 00:01:13.066
Whoever marries in this life is unlucky

33
00:01:13.266 --> 00:01:14.066
you

34
00:01:14.966 --> 00:01:16.800
What the hell are you talking about?

35
00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.833
Is this the kind of place where trash like you should come?

36
00:01:20.066 --> 00:01:21.400
Just let me advise you.

37
00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.433
A pauper like you

38
00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:24.500
Get out of here

39
00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.333
Don't lose your damn pants

40
00:01:27.333 --> 00:01:28.400
What are you talking about?

41
00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:28.766
Dusty

42
00:01:28.766 --> 00:01:31.533
But my VIP customers are naturally eligible to come in.

43
00:01:31.533 --> 00:01:33.833
Please speak with a little respect, okay?

44
00:01:34.066 --> 00:01:36.000
Don't care about them

45
00:01:36.166 --> 00:01:38.566
I just heard you say

46
00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:40.533
You bought Hengsheng daily limit.

47
00:01:40.533 --> 00:01:42.633
How dare you gamble?

48
00:01:43.533 --> 00:01:45.133
What the hell are you betting with me?

49
00:01:45.133 --> 00:01:48.966
I'll bet you the index plummets to 2,000
