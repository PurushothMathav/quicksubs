00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:01.166
What are you doing?

2
00:00:01.166 --> 00:00:02.766
Big brother hehe

3
00:00:02.766 --> 00:00:03.733
Finally showed up

4
00:00:03.733 --> 00:00:06.400
We're here for equity

5
00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:09.866
Hurry up and return the money to us.

6
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.066
Upstairs, you know I'm going broke

7
00:00:13.133 --> 00:00:15.500
What do I give you for equity?

8
00:00:15.733 --> 00:00:18.266
Hmph, you want to default, right?

9
00:00:18.266 --> 00:00:20.266
If you don't give us money today

10
00:00:20.333 --> 00:00:22.800
I'll smash everything in this house for you

11
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:23.766
Go go go

12
00:00:23.766 --> 00:00:24.633
How dare you

13
00:00:25.466 --> 00:00:26.900
Think about equity, right?

14
00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:28.466
Yes, I'll take it.

15
00:00:28.933 --> 00:00:33.200
But I want to charge 1/10 of the price.

16
00:00:33.366 --> 00:00:36.066
You fart 1/10

17
00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.400
You take us for fools?

18
00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:40.700
Right or not, it's up to you.

19
00:00:40.733 --> 00:00:44.366
Anyway, after Longtai Group goes bankrupt

20
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:45.966
How much is that cigarette in your hand?

21
00:00:46.666 --> 00:00:47.766
It's worthless.

22
00:00:48.133 --> 00:00:48.933
Dad?

23
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.166
Or are we still right?

24
00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:53.400
OK

25
00:00:53.966 --> 00:00:56.066
Our team can

26
00:00:56.066 --> 00:00:56.966
Hello, guys.

27
00:00:56.966 --> 00:00:57.800
Who was right?

28
00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.566
Come, come, come, the same price, I will accept it all.

29
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.833
Our team is against our team

30
00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.466
Our team sees people's hearts in adversity

31
00:01:05.933 --> 00:01:06.833
usually

32
00:01:07.466 --> 00:01:10.033
You see me humbling

33
00:01:10.733 --> 00:01:12.633
Now there's a little bit of wind and grass.

34
00:01:13.133 --> 00:01:14.866
One, five, six

35
00:01:15.733 --> 00:01:18.033
You scum

36
00:01:18.166 --> 00:01:19.966
Dad, don't be angry

37
00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:21.400
OK

38
00:01:21.933 --> 00:01:24.866
Usually, you are the chairperson of the group

39
00:01:25.266 --> 00:01:26.566
To respect you

40
00:01:26.933 --> 00:01:30.200
Your company is now bankrupt

41
00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:31.800
Who gives you face?

42
00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:36.733
I'm happy when I get the money

43
00:01:36.733 --> 00:01:38.366
Hahaha, that's right.

44
00:01:38.366 --> 00:01:41.300
We only look at the money cut.

45
00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.066
You can dry it at once.

46
00:01:45.266 --> 00:01:46.266
After this?

47
00:01:46.266 --> 00:01:48.533
There are fewer idlers and helpers in the company

48
00:01:48.533 --> 00:01:50.233
And I want you to listen to me.

49
00:01:50.666 --> 00:01:53.966
I'm going to make you regret it now
