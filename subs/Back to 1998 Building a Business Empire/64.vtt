00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:01.766
Yeah. What about us?

2
00:00:01.766 --> 00:00:03.466
You can use part of it first.

3
00:00:03.733 --> 00:00:05.766
Classic house for pre-sale

4
00:00:06.766 --> 00:00:09.833
Can you give some larger discounts?

5
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.500
To encourage users to make deals as soon as possible

6
00:00:13.666 --> 00:00:16.066
A good way to do this

7
00:00:16.066 --> 00:00:17.166
Money from selling the house

8
00:00:17.166 --> 00:00:19.333
Before the house is fully built

9
00:00:19.333 --> 00:00:20.766
It's all back in our hands

10
00:00:20.766 --> 00:00:23.600
Then take the money to buy land

11
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.166
Then go to the bank for a loan

12
00:00:25.166 --> 00:00:26.166
One set at a time

13
00:00:26.166 --> 00:00:27.466
One by one

14
00:00:27.466 --> 00:00:28.400
Is that so?

15
00:00:29.133 --> 00:00:31.700
Will we still have any obstacles in the real estate market?

16
00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:32.933
According to you

17
00:00:32.933 --> 00:00:34.133
Isn't it soon

18
00:00:34.133 --> 00:00:37.000
The entire market of cloud worms was swallowed by us

19
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.166
To tell you the truth

20
00:00:38.766 --> 00:00:39.900
That's not the intention

21
00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:41.633
It's all over the place.

22
00:00:41.766 --> 00:00:44.066
We take the bank money and build the building

23
00:00:44.166 --> 00:00:47.566
Our funds are still our own

24
00:00:47.566 --> 00:00:48.400
But

25
00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.966
If the capital chain in the middle breaks

26
00:00:50.966 --> 00:00:52.300
Isn't it all forgotten?

27
00:00:52.366 --> 00:00:55.166
Even if there is a real break in this capital chain

28
00:00:55.166 --> 00:00:57.200
It's not raw materials that should be invested

29
00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:58.600
It's you.

30
00:00:59.266 --> 00:01:01.200
Luckily I got directions from the bank

31
00:01:02.266 --> 00:01:03.066
Ride the Wind

32
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:04.866
I didn't say you

33
00:01:04.866 --> 00:01:06.700
What a genius you are!
