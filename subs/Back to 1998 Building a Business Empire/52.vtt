Mr. Zhou, happy cooperation, happy cooperation.

2
00:00:04.533 --> 00:00:06.666
Can you tell me now?

3
00:00:06.666 --> 00:00:09.366
How can a non-Q show work hard?

4
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:11.000
Of course you can.

5
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.300
First of all, what about me?

6
00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:15.166
How many functional improvements are there?

7
00:00:15.266 --> 00:00:17.966
Allow certain paying users

8
00:00:17.966 --> 00:00:20.066
To upload your own exclusive avatar.

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.900
Avatar pair second

10
00:00:22.966 --> 00:00:25.766
Develop virtual non-Q show capabilities

11
00:00:25.933 --> 00:00:26.966
Is it for users?

12
00:00:26.966 --> 00:00:29.333
Dress up for your avatar

13
00:00:29.333 --> 00:00:30.833
A variety of clothing

14
00:00:31.733 --> 00:00:34.066
Mr. Cheng's suggestion is excellent

15
00:00:34.166 --> 00:00:37.200
This is sure to inspire customers' enthusiasm for consumption

16
00:00:37.533 --> 00:00:40.866
Third, develop non-q-space functions

17
00:00:40.866 --> 00:00:41.500
Let the user

18
00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:42.966
There is a cloud of pure

19
00:00:42.966 --> 00:00:45.700
And a place to display personal space

20
00:00:45.866 --> 00:00:48.466
Mr. Cheng, I will do it now

21
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.466
How do you come up with all these ideas?

22
00:00:51.533 --> 00:00:52.466
Don't listen to me

23
00:00:52.466 --> 00:00:54.500
I want to try out these new features right away.

24
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.666
Now you have to satisfy something

25
00:00:56.666 --> 00:00:58.366
User's personalized needs

26
00:00:58.366 --> 00:00:59.900
Capture users' pain points

27
00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:01.800
Can this make a good product?

28
00:01:02.466 --> 00:01:03.933
Support Mr. Chen

29
00:01:03.933 --> 00:01:06.600
I will contact you as soon as I am done.

30
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.800
Okay, right?

31
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.100
Money problem

32
00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.566
If it's not enough, keep talking to me.

33
00:01:12.566 --> 00:01:13.833
OK, got it.

34
00:01:13.933 --> 00:01:16.500
I have good money

35
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.666
Then I won't disturb you.

36
00:01:22.333 --> 00:01:24.200
Brother Liu, our IQ communication software

37
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.266
The number of users has dropped significantly this month

38
00:01:27.133 --> 00:01:28.666
What did they say?

39
00:01:28.966 --> 00:01:30.200
Because our opponent is not q.

40
00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:31.266
He made an upgrade

41
00:01:31.266 --> 00:01:33.400
Attracted all the UFOs

42
00:01:33.466 --> 00:01:36.766
Tell you what I don't care about.

00:01:36.766 --> 00:01:37.966
Check it out for me.

44
00:01:37.966 --> 00:01:40.266
I can't find out, get out
