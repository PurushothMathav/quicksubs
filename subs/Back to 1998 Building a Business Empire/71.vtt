00:00:01.966 --> 00:00:03.800
Houses are so expensive now.

2
00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:06.533
You see, this new product will sell for 30,000 a flat

3
00:00:06.533 --> 00:00:08.966
Yipin Xinhui

4
00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:12.566
Such a top real estate

5
00:00:12.666 --> 00:00:15.166
Now it's only going to be one more 30,000

6
00:00:15.566 --> 00:00:16.700
You know?

7
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:20.100
This property will be built 20 years later

8
00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.766
But at least 200,000 yuan flat?

9
00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:24.000
Excuse me.

10
00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.566
Why don't we go look at the house?

11
00:00:26.566 --> 00:00:27.633
viewing

12
00:00:28.533 --> 00:00:31.466
I do know a few cheaper ones.

13
00:00:31.866 --> 00:00:34.666
Just look at this Yipin Xinhui you mentioned.

14
00:00:34.666 --> 00:00:36.266
Yipin Xinhui

15
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.766
Are you going to hold a new meeting?

16
00:00:37.766 --> 00:00:40.566
Because only such a house is worthy of you

17
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.000
You're welcome to go.

18
00:00:43.533 --> 00:00:44.733
They're getting married soon.

19
00:00:44.733 --> 00:00:46.100
The house hasn't been decided yet.

20
00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:47.700
Are you not going to marry me?

21
00:00:47.933 --> 00:00:50.900
Look, I'm not saying I won't marry you

22
00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.200
There has been a problem with the company account recently.

23
00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.066
I'll buy you a house after this time

24
00:00:55.066 --> 00:00:55.866
Ok?

25
00:00:57.766 --> 00:01:00.900
What the hell are you doing here?

26
00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.633
Chengfeng, it seems that you are indeed a little free now

27
00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.166
Are you thinking of buying a house?

28
00:01:05.166 --> 00:01:07.800
But you're in the wrong place

29
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.966
This is not a house that someone like you can afford

30
00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:12.100
Right?

31
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.000
Liu Shao Liu Shao

32
00:01:14.133 --> 00:01:16.400
It doesn't seem to be holding you back at work

33
00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.300
I'm still in the mood to come here to see the house

34
00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.500
Success, don't be so damn proud here

35
00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.500
I, Liu Yaoyang, can solve that little problem by myself.

36
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.166
I'll tell you what.

37
00:01:27.166 --> 00:01:29.233
Well, don't you fucking talk about mercy here

38
00:01:30.566 --> 00:01:32.966
What is your most expensive villa?

39
00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.666
Show me.

40
00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.800
Hello, I'll take you to see it.

41
00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:39.866
Why is this sale like this?

42
00:01:39.866 --> 00:01:41.766
This is leaving with Liu Yangyang and the others

43
00:01:41.766 --> 00:01:43.933
It's okay not to serve us.

44
00:01:43.933 --> 00:01:44.800
His mind

45
00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:47.400
Hello, why don't I introduce you?

46
00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.000
Yes, then you can show me the villa too.

47
00:01:50.866 --> 00:01:52.366
I love that shirt on you.

48
00:01:52.533 --> 00:01:54.266
If I take out a loan to buy it

49
00:01:54.466 --> 00:01:55.866
Can you give some discounts?
