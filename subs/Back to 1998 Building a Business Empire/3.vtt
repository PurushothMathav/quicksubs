00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:02.366
Cheng Guang, you bastard, I

2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.666
You give it to me.

3
00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:09.133
I told you to leave

4
00:00:09.133 --> 00:00:11.333
Look how you got together in the hospital

5
00:00:11.333 --> 00:00:12.400
Mom confessed

6
00:00:13.933 --> 00:00:14.733
Mom

7
00:00:16.866 --> 00:00:17.833
Mom

8
00:00:18.866 --> 00:00:19.866
Will you come?

9
00:00:20.966 --> 00:00:22.500
Why are you here, mom?

10
00:00:23.166 --> 00:00:23.966
You see

11
00:00:26.933 --> 00:00:28.533
You immortal!

12
00:00:28.533 --> 00:00:30.833
My daughter and I have spent so many years with your son

13
00:00:30.866 --> 00:00:32.266
He said divorce is divorce

14
00:00:32.266 --> 00:00:33.933
No compensation 100,000 dollars

15
00:00:33.933 --> 00:00:35.466
I can't handle this

16
00:00:35.666 --> 00:00:36.600
That is.

17
00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:38.900
Or take out 100,000 and build a house for my brother

18
00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:40.300
Or we'll get a divorce

19
00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:41.700
What wind

20
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.433
What the hell is going on?

21
00:00:43.533 --> 00:00:47.100
Mom, I want to drink Snow White Island for divorce?

22
00:00:47.266 --> 00:00:49.066
You child

23
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.933
I finally got you a wife

24
00:00:50.933 --> 00:00:51.966
Why is it so bad?

25
00:00:52.133 --> 00:00:55.366
Mom, you don't know

26
00:00:55.933 --> 00:00:58.566
This Snow taught them whether their family is a good person or not

27
00:00:58.933 --> 00:01:01.633
It will harm us in the future

28
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.100
Chen Fang, what nonsense are you talking about here?

29
00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:05.400
I don't care if you want so much.

30
00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.300
Give 100,000 dollars in compensation

31
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.900
I'm here to kill you

32
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.166
Just hand over 100,000 dollars

33
00:01:12.166 --> 00:01:15.066
How can I afford that much money?

34
00:01:15.066 --> 00:01:17.366
It's none of your business, Mom.

35
00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:22.566
Watch you lie to me again

36
00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.400
What are you doing? Let me go

37
00:01:33.533 --> 00:01:35.033
Ah, it's alright, it's alright

38
00:01:35.133 --> 00:01:36.400
Ah it's alright

39
00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:37.200
Wang Hanhan

40
00:01:38.266 --> 00:01:39.633
Wang Han, I'm sorry.

41
00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.400
This is the only thing mom gave you

42
00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:48.266
There is no burden like mother left.

43
00:01:49.733 --> 00:01:52.666
You can live your life

44
00:01:54.333 --> 00:01:56.666
Mom, don't worry.

45
00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.900
Son, I will definitely find the best doctor for you.
