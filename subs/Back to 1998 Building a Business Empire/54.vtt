1
00:00:00.533 --> 00:00:02.100
Mr. Cheng is terrible

2
00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:03.900
What's the matter, Mr. Cheng?

3
00:00:04.333 --> 00:00:06.666
Look, we just updated it a few days ago.

4
00:00:06.666 --> 00:00:09.166
This IQ also has a new IQ show function.

5
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.100
It's exactly the same as ours.

6
00:00:11.533 --> 00:00:12.500
What should I do if I withdraw?

7
00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:14.533
This is blatant plagiarism

8
00:00:14.533 --> 00:00:16.633
This Liu Yaoyang is only so capable

9
00:00:16.733 --> 00:00:18.733
Should we sue him?

10
00:00:18.733 --> 00:00:19.533
This era

11
00:00:19.533 --> 00:00:21.433
Intellectual property protection law is not perfect

12
00:00:22.266 --> 00:00:23.566
As long as the underlying data is different

13
00:00:23.566 --> 00:00:25.000
There should be no plagiarism at all.

14
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.066
It seems

15
00:00:26.066 --> 00:00:28.666
We must develop a non-Q game hall as soon as possible

16
00:00:28.866 --> 00:00:31.066
The amount of data in the game lobby is very large

17
00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:32.700
It can't be done in a while.

18
00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.466
Then buy a game developed by another company

19
00:00:35.466 --> 00:00:36.466
Integrate first

20
00:00:36.466 --> 00:00:38.100
What to buy

21
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.566
Remember the problem now is buying time

22
00:00:40.566 --> 00:00:42.300
What can be bought with money

23
00:00:42.666 --> 00:00:43.900
It's not a problem.

24
00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.233
Isn't that the power of money?

25
00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:52.566
This time, this Liu Yaoyang will be completely powerless to resist

26
00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.900
Brother Liu, I'm not talking nonsense to you.
