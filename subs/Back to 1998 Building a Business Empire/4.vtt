00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:07.933
How much will it cost?

5
00:00:07.933 --> 00:00:09.666
According to the latest foreign technology

00:00:09.933 --> 00:00:12.266
At least 100,000 100,000

00:00:16.866 --> 00:00:19.033
How can I make do with so much money?

July 12, 1998

11
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:35.300
Ah!

12
00:00:36.933 --> 00:00:38.400
Ha tomorrow

Tomorrow is the day of Brazil's sudden cold bark in France

14
00:00:42.466 --> 00:00:46.000
By the way, if history hadn't changed because of this

15
00:00:46.733 --> 00:00:49.766
And that's what happens with the cookies you eat.

16

Mom

18
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.300

The passbook is fake

24
00:01:08.133 --> 00:01:11.100
Sorry, the account has been shown to be empty a few days ago.

25
00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.800
It shows that it was picked up by the Snow Exchange.
