00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:01.066
Hello

2
00:00:02.066 --> 00:00:03.900
This is impossible

3
00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:05.066
You must have stolen it

4
00:00:05.066 --> 00:00:06.433
It must have been stolen.

5
00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:10.333
Mr. Xu, you sold me this phone number.

6
00:00:10.333 --> 00:00:12.133
Why did you call this poor guy?

7
00:00:12.133 --> 00:00:13.900
Oh, I spent so much money.

8
00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:15.466
You help him earn this

9
00:00:15.566 --> 00:00:17.266
Eyeless thing

10
00:00:17.266 --> 00:00:19.566
This is the real ancient god of Yuncheng

11
00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.700
Mr. Chen, the instructions you gave me last time

12
00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:24.533
Made me transfer another 30 million

13
00:00:24.533 --> 00:00:28.000
Hey, hey, today, sir, the audience is free of charge.

14
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:28.800
Xu Run

15
00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:31.100
Explain it

16
00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:33.800
Mr. Chen, you are disturbing the staff.

17
00:00:35.733 --> 00:00:36.533
Don't be afraid.

18
00:00:37.333 --> 00:00:39.400
As long as you study hard

19
00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.700
You are really the stock that made hundreds of millions in three days

20
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.366
God didn't expect it to be our classmate

21
00:00:44.366 --> 00:00:45.800
Say no more.

22
00:00:46.066 --> 00:00:47.066
Dear students

23
00:00:47.266 --> 00:00:48.266
I still want to socialize

24
00:00:49.466 --> 00:00:50.900
Hey, you are poor.

25
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:51.966
Ride the Wind

26
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.300
I just didn't know Tarzan

27
00:00:54.366 --> 00:00:56.533
I didn't expect your career to be so big

28
00:00:56.533 --> 00:00:58.066
Let's be classmates

29
00:00:58.066 --> 00:01:00.566
You have the opportunity to make money. Take us with you.

30
00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:01.866
Yes, ride the wind

31
00:01:01.866 --> 00:01:04.766
If you are really so good, give some to your classmates

32
00:01:05.066 --> 00:01:06.600
You can't be so stingy, can you?

33
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:07.200
Ah, yeah.

34
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.433
Weren't they all still digging at the dust just now?

35
00:01:09.533 --> 00:01:12.166
Why have they changed their faces one by one now?

36
00:01:12.466 --> 00:01:14.766
I think the significance of the reunion

37
00:01:14.766 --> 00:01:18.300
It is about strengthening the relationship between our classmates

38
00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.233
If we only talk about money

39
00:01:21.166 --> 00:01:22.900
It's so boring

40
00:01:23.266 --> 00:01:24.766
Such a reunion

41
00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:26.366
Not participating
