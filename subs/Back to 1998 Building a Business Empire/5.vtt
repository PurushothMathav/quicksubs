00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:02.766
Squad leader Chen Feng

2
00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:04.966
I didn't expect to meet you here

3
00:00:07.566 --> 00:00:09.433
I just heard about my aunt's situation.

4
00:00:09.766 --> 00:00:11.000
Auntie is still in the hospital

5
00:00:11.133 --> 00:00:12.700
It should be an excuse for money

6
00:00:13.333 --> 00:00:15.300
Xiao Liu helped me withdraw 10,000 yuan to Mr. Chen

7
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.200
You are not the monitor, I am not a human being

8
00:00:19.466 --> 00:00:21.033
They're all old classmates

9
00:00:21.066 --> 00:00:23.166
Your family is also in a hurry to accept it with money.

10
00:00:23.733 --> 00:00:24.900
My ability is limited

11
00:00:24.933 --> 00:00:26.233
I can only help you here.

12
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.033
Thank you, thank you, monitor

13
00:00:30.666 --> 00:00:32.300
I will definitely repay you well.

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.766
Hey, you said that Brazil is playing France.

16
00:00:42.866 --> 00:00:44.433
Just the Brazilian lineup

00:00:44.666 --> 00:00:45.400
Ronaldo

18
00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:46.200
Rivaldo

19
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.500
Carlos Carver is one of the best players in the world

20
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.100
How do you think a Brazilian team like this lost?

21
00:00:53.666 --> 00:00:55.866
France has reached the final for the first time

22
00:00:56.133 --> 00:00:57.766
Four Star Brazil Plaza

23
00:00:57.766 --> 00:01:01.066
This time Brazil is definitely the defending champion

24
00:01:01.066 --> 00:01:03.200
Hahaha boss

25
00:01:03.366 --> 00:01:06.166
I buy 100 yuan Brazilian camp boss

26
00:01:07.466 --> 00:01:10.066
Marcy 2:0 hahaha

27
00:01:10.066 --> 00:01:14.166
In fact, I also bought Brazil 3:0.

29
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.600

30
00:01:19.366 --> 00:01:22.200
3:0 Brazil Hahaha

31
00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:25.066
Where did the fool come from?

32
00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:27.800
France 3:0 Brazil

33
00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.866
I'm afraid you bought it upside down.

34
00:01:29.866 --> 00:01:31.566
That guy?

35
00:01:31.566 --> 00:01:33.600
Well, what if you haven't played football?

36
00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.366
I advise you not to play

37
00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:40.633
Boss, I want to buy French 3A.

38
00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:42.900

00:01:42.966 --> 00:01:45.600
