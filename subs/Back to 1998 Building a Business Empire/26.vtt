00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:01.033
It's very simple.

2
00:00:01.066 --> 00:00:03.633
I've been following the stock of American Super Silver Corporation

3
00:00:03.766 --> 00:00:05.500
Recently, the top management of their company

4
00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:07.066
Are selling like crazy for cash

5
00:00:07.066 --> 00:00:07.900
As far as I know

6
00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:10.666
Many domestic airlines are implicated in this

7
00:00:10.666 --> 00:00:13.166
I think the same is true of uncle's company

8
00:00:13.166 --> 00:00:13.966
Hey

9
00:00:14.733 --> 00:00:16.600
You got it right.

10
00:00:16.666 --> 00:00:17.800
Because of this

11
00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.800
The company's capital chain will break

12
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:20.866
Otherwise?

13
00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.766
I won't marry Qianqi to the Zhao family

14
00:00:23.866 --> 00:00:26.100
Chen Feng, you are too smart

15
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:26.733
Family passed

16
00:00:26.733 --> 00:00:28.533
Stocks determine my dad's company status

17
00:00:28.533 --> 00:00:29.666
Just a little experience

18
00:00:29.666 --> 00:00:31.533
And I think you should terminate the contract immediately

19
00:00:31.533 --> 00:00:32.666
Avoid greater losses

20
00:00:32.666 --> 00:00:34.100
Where did the wild monkey come from?

21
00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.566
Dare to point fingers at me and the Xu family

22
00:00:36.566 --> 00:00:39.500
Cousin Chen Feng was specially invited by me to help

23
00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.033
What do you mean by that?

24
00:00:41.166 --> 00:00:44.200
Uncle, I just got a reply from Chaoyin Company.

25
00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.166
If we complete the cooperation now

26
00:00:46.166 --> 00:00:47.166
After 10 days

27
00:00:47.166 --> 00:00:49.566
They will return the 200 million contract to us

28
00:00:49.566 --> 00:00:50.933
But if it stops now

29
00:00:50.933 --> 00:00:52.800
Wouldn't that be a waste of a billion

30
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:53.900
This is true.

31
00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:55.133
Of course it's true.

32
00:00:55.133 --> 00:00:57.700
This is the contract attachment they just sent.

33
00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:58.733
So?

34
00:00:58.733 --> 00:01:01.766
If you are an outsider, don't be a bare-handed painter in the Xu family

35
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.600
If Yang Xu remembers correctly

36
00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:08.033
In his last life, he was sentenced for embezzlement of public funds

37
00:01:08.266 --> 00:01:10.566
Boy, why don't you speak?

38
00:01:10.566 --> 00:01:12.066
If I'm not mistaken

39
00:01:12.066 --> 00:01:14.300
Uncle only needs to sign this contract

40
00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:17.233
You'll get 30% legal

41
00:01:17.366 --> 00:01:19.600
That's over 60 million

42
00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.566
You are talking nonsense
