00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:02.300
Ha ha.

2
00:00:02.533 --> 00:00:06.700
Hahaha, 10,000 yuan to buy an unpopular one.

3
00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:09.633
Is there something wrong with your brain, boy?

4
00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:11.366
I will advise you one last time

5
00:00:11.366 --> 00:00:12.700
What about our lottery ticket?

6
00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:15.466
Once sold, it is non-refundable.

7
00:00:15.466 --> 00:00:17.666
If you lose, it's upside down

8
00:00:17.666 --> 00:00:19.500
Don't make trouble with me.

9
00:00:20.733 --> 00:00:23.900
The boss has issued the ticket, wait a minute.

10
00:00:25.133 --> 00:00:27.933
The boy will wait to see you cry in a while

11
00:00:27.933 --> 00:00:30.500
Final score France 3:0 Brazil

12
00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.200
Congratulations to France for winning the Hercules Cup for the first time

13
00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:35.866
It's impossible.

14
00:00:35.866 --> 00:00:37.566
Absolutely impossible

15
00:00:37.766 --> 00:00:39.200
Four Guns and Eight Flags

16
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.166
He didn't score a damn ball.

17
00:00:41.733 --> 00:00:44.033
Let's talk about it, boss.

18
00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.866
They are really amazing, this guy

19
00:00:50.466 --> 00:00:51.266
Yo

20
00:00:51.566 --> 00:00:53.966
How did this all start buying a lottery ticket?

21
00:00:53.966 --> 00:00:57.866
It seems that my divorce will hit you hard.

22
00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.866
It's getting crazy.

23
00:00:59.966 --> 00:01:01.533
Who has a whim?

24
00:01:01.533 --> 00:01:02.666
I'll tell you what.

25
00:01:02.666 --> 00:01:05.900
Divorcing you was the best decision I ever made

26
00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:09.100
Don't force yourself to tell you

27
00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.266
Someone has already proposed to me.

28
00:01:11.266 --> 00:01:13.866
And he is still a rich second generation

29
00:01:13.966 --> 00:01:15.533
You poor wretch!

30
00:01:15.533 --> 00:01:18.233
Can't even compare to a toe

31
00:01:18.366 --> 00:01:20.966
You are talking about Liu Yaoyao.

32
00:01:21.166 --> 00:01:22.300
I'll tell you what.

33
00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:25.666
I'll make you two bitches pay sooner or later

34
00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.266
What's wrong? Are you in a bad mood?

35
00:01:31.266 --> 00:01:35.200
Strange autumn wind, he seems to know about us

36
00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:37.966
It's okay, you two are divorced anyway

37
00:01:37.966 --> 00:01:39.166
It won't be long.

38
00:01:39.166 --> 00:01:41.000
I'll tell him to get out of Jiangcheng
