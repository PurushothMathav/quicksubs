00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:01.333
What nonsense

2
00:00:01.333 --> 00:00:03.333
Your company is about to go bankrupt

3
00:00:03.333 --> 00:00:04.766
Can't you predict the future?

4
00:00:04.766 --> 00:00:06.200
Come and test it for you.

5
00:00:06.366 --> 00:00:08.700
How would you die if your company went bankrupt?

6
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.066
You tell He Zhiqiang

7
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.066
It's not too late for him to stop now

8
00:00:12.733 --> 00:00:15.966
It's not that you can't afford it

9
00:00:19.133 --> 00:00:19.966
hateful

10
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:22.100
Liu Yangyang again

11
00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:23.466
It seems that this time the family is out

12
00:00:23.466 --> 00:00:25.400
It's an idea to take us down

13
00:00:25.533 --> 00:00:26.966
They are so rich

14
00:00:26.966 --> 00:00:28.833
Our funds simply can't fight

15
00:00:28.966 --> 00:00:30.366
How can this be good?

16
00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:31.900
We can only wait

17
00:00:32.333 --> 00:00:33.766
Three days later.

18
00:00:35.566 --> 00:00:37.000
Is our only chance

19
00:00:37.133 --> 00:00:39.733
Three days later, the Dahan index plummeted for 6,500 days

20
00:00:39.733 --> 00:00:41.900
All stocks fell an average of 57%.

21
00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.600
The Financial Secretary decides that the platform will be subject to shrewd regulation

22
00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.666
So three years from now is our only chance

23
00:00:49.866 --> 00:00:50.666
We

24
00:00:52.166 --> 00:00:53.166
Wait for the wind
