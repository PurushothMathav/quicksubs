00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:02.666
I've been in the hospital for so long that I'm bored

2
00:00:02.666 --> 00:00:04.166
Still comfortable outside

3
00:00:04.166 --> 00:00:05.700
After mom is discharged from the hospital this time

4
00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.566
Can't you tire yourself anymore?

5
00:00:07.566 --> 00:00:09.500
Hey, I know.

6
00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:11.566
From now on, I will never be strong again

7
00:00:11.566 --> 00:00:12.466
Son

8
00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:15.466
How much does it cost you to live in such a nice place?

9
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.166
Mom?

10
00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:21.000
I have registered a company in this community

11
00:00:21.133 --> 00:00:22.200
For office convenience

12
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.966
I bought such a villa right next to it.

13
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.700
This time, you will live with me in this villa

14
00:00:28.866 --> 00:00:30.600
I'll get you a babysitter then.

15
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.033
You will be responsible for enjoying the happiness in the future

16
00:00:33.733 --> 00:00:36.000
Why don't you hire a nanny?

17
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.700
What a waste of money!

18
00:00:37.766 --> 00:00:39.500
Your son, I made money.

19
00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.166
Then the money my son earns is to honor you, right?

20
00:00:42.333 --> 00:00:43.600
Just listen to me.

21
00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:45.700
Good wind

22
00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:47.200
Really promising

23
00:00:47.333 --> 00:00:48.600
Mom, please be happy.

24
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.200
Hahaha, mobile phone mom.

25
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:52.600
I still left my phone in the car

26
00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.333
Wait for me here for a while, I'll get it.

27
00:00:54.333 --> 00:00:55.500
You go get it

28
00:00:58.166 --> 00:01:00.833
Son son where are you son

29
00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:03.300
son

30
00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:06.833
You immortal caught my son

31
00:01:07.666 --> 00:01:09.966
So it's you, the immortal
