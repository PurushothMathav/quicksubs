00:00:00.766 --> 00:00:03.700
Why did Miss He come here?

2
00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:04.800
What can I do for you?

3
00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:05.866
Mr. Cheng

4
00:00:05.966 --> 00:00:09.566
I came today to sign a contract

5
00:00:10.533 --> 00:00:13.466
Why does Miss He want to intervene?

6
00:00:13.933 --> 00:00:17.233
I didn't like to meddle in my own business

7
00:00:17.866 --> 00:00:19.466
But on this land

8
00:00:19.533 --> 00:00:21.600
My dad went through a lot of stuff.

9
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:23.766
So

10
00:00:24.566 --> 00:00:26.766
I can't give up on this

11
00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:29.266
What does it have to do with me?

12
00:00:29.966 --> 00:00:30.833
Ride the Wind

13
00:00:31.533 --> 00:00:33.166
Be a person and stay on the line

14
00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.466
Why kill them all?

15
00:00:35.466 --> 00:00:38.800
Those rumors on the construction site are not good for our investment promotion

16
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.000
I want you to clear up those rumors

17
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.900
Then if I were

18
00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.900
Say you can't ride the wind

19
00:00:47.066 --> 00:00:48.766
How dare you!

20
00:00:48.966 --> 00:00:50.800
Forget it, look at me

21
00:00:51.266 --> 00:00:53.100
For the sake of having a crush on you

22
00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:54.933
I won't bother with you

23
00:00:54.933 --> 00:00:58.800
As long as you can let our construction site recruit students smoothly

24
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.366
Your benefits will be indispensable in the future

25
00:01:02.733 --> 00:01:04.100
Why can't I see it?

26
00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:06.100
What are the benefits you mentioned?

27
00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:08.833
Join forces with our family

28
00:01:09.166 --> 00:01:11.833
The whole cloud is yours

29
00:01:11.966 --> 00:01:15.166
Isn't that enough for you?

30
00:01:16.533 --> 00:01:17.500
you
