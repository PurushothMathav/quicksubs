00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.566
I was born.

2
00:00:05.866 --> 00:00:08.400
Chen Feng, my brother wants to cover the bed with a quilt.

3
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.600
You want 100,000 dollars and you keep dragging it

4
00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:11.766
What do you mean?

5
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:15.266
That's not possible.

6
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.266
You got killed in your last life

7
00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:23.900
This life must make you pay with blood

8
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.266
Hey, I talked to you

9
00:00:28.266 --> 00:00:29.866
You're dumb. Get out

10
00:00:30.533 --> 00:00:31.500
I have no money.

11
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.433
Hmph, what's your attitude?

12
00:00:34.733 --> 00:00:36.666
He is your kiss bunny

13
00:00:36.666 --> 00:00:39.500
I don't care if you sell your house or land

14
00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.100
Don't think about that person

15
00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:42.433
Sure enough!

16
00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.766
You just want to hit this house, don't you?

17
00:00:44.766 --> 00:00:45.700
I'll tell you what.

18
00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:48.466
My parents worked so hard to build this house

19
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.266
Why do you sell when you say so?

20
00:00:50.933 --> 00:00:52.400
Just you sell that shoe.

21
00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:53.400
I'll tell you what.

22
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:54.766
He's not far from death

23
00:00:54.766 --> 00:00:57.033
Your house will be mine sooner or later

24
00:00:58.466 --> 00:00:59.833
Dream your dreams

25
00:00:59.966 --> 00:01:01.200
I'll tell you what.

26
00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.566
If I still let your family live in this life

27
00:01:03.566 --> 00:01:05.100
I write it upside down

28
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.133
Ride the Wind

29
00:01:06.133 --> 00:01:10.200
If you dare to push me, I will tell you.

30
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.533
I can't live this day

31
00:01:11.533 --> 00:01:12.466
I want a divorce.

32
00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.033
How are you?

33
00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.133
It's a deal.

34
00:01:15.133 --> 00:01:17.500
Tomorrow, we will see you at the Civil Affairs Bureau.

35
00:01:17.566 --> 00:01:18.900
You bitch

36
00:01:19.466 --> 00:01:21.400
Man you bastard me
