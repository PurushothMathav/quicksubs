00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.100
You are talking nonsense, what evidence do you have?

2
00:00:02.133 --> 00:00:03.166
Very simple.

3
00:00:03.166 --> 00:00:04.933
Now check your galactic water

4
00:00:04.933 --> 00:00:07.266
I only know how many times I was 18

5
00:00:07.266 --> 00:00:09.100
Worked hard for more than ten years

6
00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:12.000
You think my uncle will take your word for it?

7
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.533
Just check your bank flow.

8
00:00:14.533 --> 00:00:15.566
I'll tell you what.

9
00:00:15.566 --> 00:00:17.266
You are invading my privacy

10
00:00:17.533 --> 00:00:18.800
Uncle, this outsider

11
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.300
Is to provoke our relationship

12
00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.166
Of course it feels easy

13
00:00:22.166 --> 00:00:24.900
Check it out and you'll know

14
00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:26.500
Check it out for me

15
00:00:26.766 --> 00:00:29.566
Yes, I'm calling now to check his running water.

16
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:31.900
Don't come

17
00:00:32.066 --> 00:00:33.633
Uncle, I know it hurts

18
00:00:34.366 --> 00:00:36.166
I shouldn't have cheated

19
00:00:36.466 --> 00:00:38.833
Yang Xu, my father trusts you so much

20
00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:41.266
You actually took bribes at this juncture

21
00:00:41.666 --> 00:00:43.000
You are worthy of our family

22
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.266
More than 10 million bribes

23
00:00:45.466 --> 00:00:47.000
At least it's a weapon

24
00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.000
Please don't uncle

25
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.500
I dare not reply please

26
00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:51.466
Don't call the police.

27
00:00:51.466 --> 00:00:52.433
Let me go

28
00:00:52.666 --> 00:00:54.833
Hey my own sister

29
00:00:55.133 --> 00:00:56.300
After death

30
00:00:56.533 --> 00:00:58.700
I will help you raise it like a son

31
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.100
I used to raise a white-eyed wolf

32
00:01:01.366 --> 00:01:04.700
Don't go there again, you pack my things and leave Xu's house

33
00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:06.633
Ok I roll I roll

34
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.833
Uncle, are you really not going to call the police?

35
00:01:12.966 --> 00:01:14.200
Get out of here

36
00:01:17.666 --> 00:01:19.733
Multiply you wait for me

37
00:01:19.733 --> 00:01:20.766
I'm not done with you

38
00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.766
Mr. Yang, I've been waiting for you for a long time
