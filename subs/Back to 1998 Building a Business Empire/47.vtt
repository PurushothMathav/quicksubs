00:00:01.366 --> 00:00:03.700
If I want you, you bastard, how dare you lie to me?

2
00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:05.500
That's unprofessional.

3
00:00:06.466 --> 00:00:08.066
I must hack you to death

4
00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:10.300
Brother Dao

5
00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.066
It's going to be cracked down in two years

6
00:00:13.266 --> 00:00:15.466
Big brother, stop doing this!

7
00:00:15.466 --> 00:00:17.300
Walking the rivers and lakes for so many years

8
00:00:17.366 --> 00:00:19.966
I don't do this, what else can I do?

9
00:00:19.966 --> 00:00:21.666
Oh my god

10
00:00:21.666 --> 00:00:22.800
A word of advice from the younger brother

11
00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:24.200
Drop the butcher knife

12
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:25.100
Become a Buddha on the spot

13
00:00:26.166 --> 00:00:28.366
If Brother Dao doesn't dislike it

14
00:00:28.366 --> 00:00:30.300
I'd like to lend you some money

15
00:00:30.466 --> 00:00:31.966
As your startup capital

16
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:33.400
Big brother said it was true

17
00:00:34.966 --> 00:00:36.900
Brother, I see you.

18
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.600
Not bad by nature

19
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.100
Know how to keep promises

20
00:00:40.466 --> 00:00:42.233
Abide by professional ethics

21
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:43.466
Such character

22
00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.066
It will definitely achieve something great

23
00:00:47.533 --> 00:00:48.966
I remember for so long

24
00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:51.866
Are you the first person to say yes to me?

25
00:00:53.533 --> 00:00:55.533
So I'll get you 1 million

26
00:00:55.533 --> 00:00:58.233
Brother Zhang took his brothers with him for the rest of his life

27
00:00:58.866 --> 00:01:00.100
start over

28
00:01:00.166 --> 00:01:02.333
Brother, are we really rich this time?

29
00:01:02.333 --> 00:01:03.766
You can marry a wife

30
00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:06.900
Thank you for your support, big brother.

31
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:07.700
No, no, no.

32
00:01:08.133 --> 00:01:11.233
We must do it all over again

33
00:01:11.666 --> 00:01:15.266
Be a useful person to society and do well

34
00:01:26.733 --> 00:01:29.400
Mountain Peak, how did you convince them?

35
00:01:29.566 --> 00:01:33.300
You have a burning heart

36
00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:35.766
Hey bro

37
00:01:36.566 --> 00:01:39.066
I want to ask what your real name is

38
00:01:39.766 --> 00:01:40.966
