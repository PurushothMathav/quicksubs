00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:02.133
Old thing I tell you

2
00:00:02.133 --> 00:00:04.666
I asked you to pay my daughter 100,000 dollars

3
00:00:04.666 --> 00:00:05.800
Take it out for me.

4
00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:08.500
Otherwise, you can't blame us for being ruthless

5
00:00:08.533 --> 00:00:09.666
I want money

6
00:00:09.933 --> 00:00:11.466
You arrange for me to eat

7
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:13.366
Really right.

8
00:00:13.366 --> 00:00:15.800
No money, I heard

9
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.700
I made millions betting on the wind

10
00:00:17.933 --> 00:00:19.166
Okay, I'll tell you.

11
00:00:19.166 --> 00:00:22.133
You have to give me half of the money, right?

12
00:00:22.133 --> 00:00:23.366
Must be divided in half

13
00:00:23.366 --> 00:00:25.866
Oh no, I still have 1 million

14
00:00:25.866 --> 00:00:27.366
Yes 1 million

15
00:00:27.366 --> 00:00:28.866
How about so many?

16
00:00:28.866 --> 00:00:31.366
This balance is not enough for me to eat

17
00:00:31.933 --> 00:00:34.900
Mom, what are you doing?

18
00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:37.066
Why did you make so much money?

19
00:00:37.066 --> 00:00:39.300
Why don't you pour half of our blood?

20
00:00:39.533 --> 00:00:40.333
Why?

21
00:00:40.333 --> 00:00:42.933
I told you that I have divorced Bai Xuejiao

22
00:00:42.933 --> 00:00:44.800
Even if I make millions

23
00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.733
It has nothing to do with your family.

24
00:00:46.733 --> 00:00:49.766
Even if you make millions betting on football

25
00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:51.600
It's just your luck.

26
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:52.666
I'll tell you what.

27
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.800
I am the property of the Commercial Savings Bank

28
00:00:54.866 --> 00:00:56.066
Just a word from me

29
00:00:56.066 --> 00:00:57.833
You can't get a penny

30
00:00:58.266 --> 00:00:58.800
When?

31
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.200
A small branch president

32
00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:01.766
Dare to threaten customers

33
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.800
Who gave you the courage?

34
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:07.833
Colleague, why didn't I find it in our line?

35
00:01:07.933 --> 00:01:09.966
There is such a beautiful woman

36
00:01:09.966 --> 00:01:11.266
Hahaha

37
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.200
Girl my daughter's boyfriend

38
00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:16.666
Liu Yaoyang

39
00:01:16.666 --> 00:01:18.666
But you call me a big customer.

40
00:01:18.866 --> 00:01:21.233
If you offend us

41
00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:26.100
I'm afraid I have to stay at work
