00:00:01.466 --> 00:00:03.100
Is your kid called Chengfeng?

2
00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:04.433
Why are you here?

3
00:00:05.066 --> 00:00:07.100
Don't chase this kid and talk nonsense!

4
00:00:07.333 --> 00:00:09.633
There is no one in that broken place in Xi'an at night

5
00:00:09.766 --> 00:00:10.966
There is still a future

6
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Hey, I just made 30 million in the company on the east coast

7
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.500
Why is there no investment value?

8
00:00:15.866 --> 00:00:18.466
I suspect this kid is here to cheat money

9
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.033
30 million. Mmm

10
00:00:21.466 --> 00:00:23.233
How is it cash?

11
00:00:23.933 --> 00:00:25.800
Do you care if I have cash?

12
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.200
It was written in black and white on the contract

13
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:29.466
That's what I earn.

14
00:00:29.466 --> 00:00:31.066
Dad, if you had money?

15
00:00:31.066 --> 00:00:33.066
Don't throw in that bird that doesn't poop!

16
00:00:33.066 --> 00:00:35.166
Hey, you only need 100 million to vote for me.

17
00:00:35.166 --> 00:00:36.700
I'll give you tenfold in a month

18
00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:37.466
Then a billion

19
00:00:37.466 --> 00:00:38.300
shut up

20
00:00:39.333 --> 00:00:43.200
He is the bone god of my traitor, so don't be rude

21
00:00:44.166 --> 00:00:45.400
Why would you rather trust an outsider?

22
00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.200
You don't believe me, your son

23
00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.500
Shit god

24
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:50.366
Never heard of it

25
00:00:50.366 --> 00:00:52.700
Uh, Mr. Qu, let's go to an unburied place

26
00:00:52.766 --> 00:00:55.866
Sit down and talk slowly

27
00:00:55.866 --> 00:00:58.466
I'm going to die if you don't put your money in me today

28
00:00:58.466 --> 00:00:59.633
I make you last

29
00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:02.200
inverse

30
00:01:02.666 --> 00:01:05.566
If you dare to mess with me here, get out of here

31
00:01:05.566 --> 00:01:06.833
Then you hit me, right?

32
00:01:06.933 --> 00:01:08.366
Ok wait

33
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.100
Mr. Xu, since you don't believe me so much

34
00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.600
How about we make a bet?
