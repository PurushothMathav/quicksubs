00:00:05.933 --> 00:00:08.300
What did Dr. Haoran say?

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.866
The doctor said he had no obvious trauma

00:00:10.966 --> 00:00:13.966
It may be amnesia caused by excessive memory loss

00:00:16.366 --> 00:00:18.266
Who is he? I'm scared.

00:00:18.366 --> 00:00:19.666
Don't leave me

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:22.333
What's going on here?

00:00:22.566 --> 00:00:24.700
You were the first person he saw when he opened his eyes

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.933
The doctor said it might be an ostrich plot

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:31.700
When will he regain his memory?

00:00:33.366 --> 00:00:35.933
I'll take him back. I know you hit me

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:37.366
I'm not going with you.

00:00:37.466 --> 00:00:38.600
I'm not going anywhere.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:40.700
Haoran brother

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.166
Otherwise, let him stay at my place for a few days

00:00:44.366 --> 00:00:46.066
Anyway, he has amnesia

00:00:46.166 --> 00:00:47.566
There's no danger.
