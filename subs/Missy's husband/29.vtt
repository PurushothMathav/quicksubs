00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.466
Ask an art student to enter

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:06.133
What do you mean?

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:08.800
It means that...

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:11.200
The result you spent a year preparing

00:00:11.533 --> 00:00:12.900
By me for a month

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:14.933
Perfectly solved

00:00:16.133 --> 00:00:17.700
How do you manage it?

00:00:19.966 --> 00:00:21.766
Because I'm smart.

00:00:22.566 --> 00:00:25.066
Impossible absolutely impossible

00:00:25.366 --> 00:00:26.900
My stake is heavier than yours

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.766
Lu 11 let me hit you

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.300
I advise you

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.300
No matter how good it is, deal with the group of idiots in your hand

00:00:34.766 --> 00:00:36.600
Are you more than me?
