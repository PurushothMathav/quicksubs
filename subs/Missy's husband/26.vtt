00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.433
Can you stop following me?

00:00:04.533 --> 00:00:07.366
You are my girlfriend, of course I have to follow you.

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.433
No, no, no, what happened to the company?

00:00:14.533 --> 00:00:15.466
Not our company

00:00:15.566 --> 00:00:19.000
It's Lu Enterprises. Lu Enterprises made up the order overseas this morning.

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:20.100
The Jiang family suddenly put Lu Enterprises

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:21.666
All umbrella stocks have been acquired

00:00:21.766 --> 00:00:23.733
Became the largest shareholder overnight

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:25.733
Lu Enterprises is now in a mess

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.400
How is it possible for the Jiang family?

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:31.966
Isn't the Jiang family facing bankruptcy settlement?

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:33.766
Who knows?

00:00:37.766 --> 00:00:39.066
Still pretending to be poetic

00:00:39.166 --> 00:00:40.366
Home is almost gone

00:00:41.333 --> 00:00:43.100
You know I'm not poetic

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:44.566
Just your acting

00:00:44.766 --> 00:00:46.066
Who can you fool?

00:00:48.066 --> 00:00:49.700
Then you know I don't have amnesia

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.300
Then you are still willing to let me live in your house

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.100
And let me sleep with you

00:00:53.933 --> 00:00:55.000
Always mess with me

00:00:55.533 --> 00:00:57.200
Do you still have me in your heart?

00:00:57.666 --> 00:00:58.700
Go up

00:00:59.133 --> 00:01:01.100
Have the mind to play tricks here

00:01:01.266 --> 00:01:03.700
Why don't you hurry back to work?

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:05.966
Wait until I finish solving these things.

00:01:06.566 --> 00:01:07.700
I'll come to you again.
