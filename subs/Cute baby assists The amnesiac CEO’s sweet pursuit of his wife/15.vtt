00:00:01.966 --> 00:00:03.200
Why are you here?

2
00:00:03.333 --> 00:00:06.333
Daughter, I finally know that you are not going to serve

3
00:00:06.333 --> 00:00:07.866
The reason for the love

4
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.333
I didn't expect it.

5
00:00:09.333 --> 00:00:12.400
You are more scheming than your mother and I

6
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.766
Hahaha, I don't understand what you're saying.

7
00:00:14.766 --> 00:00:17.333
Sister, what else are you pretending to be with us?

8
00:00:17.333 --> 00:00:18.866
Mom and I both know

9
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.466
You come to work for Shengfeng Group

10
00:00:20.466 --> 00:00:22.366
Isn't it just to climb the general manager?

11
00:00:22.366 --> 00:00:25.100
I heard that Ji Yanting is the heir to Tianyi's assets

12
00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:27.133
His family is incredibly rich

13
00:00:27.133 --> 00:00:28.400
Stop talking nonsense, okay?

14
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:29.666
I'm just a small employee.

15
00:00:29.666 --> 00:00:31.500
You are no ordinary employee.

16
00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:33.533
You are now the assistant to the president

17
00:00:33.533 --> 00:00:35.166
It won't be long.

18
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.400
You are the president's wife, hahaha.

19
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:41.366
By then, I will be the mother of the president's wife

20
00:00:41.366 --> 00:00:43.000
Hahaha, I'm too lazy to pay attention.

21
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:43.800
Just go.

22
00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.200
Ouch, we shot it

23
00:00:46.266 --> 00:00:48.600
Sister, you have to take good care of it

24
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.200
You have to take down that memorial pavilion

25
00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.366
Then our Su family can be completely turned around

26
00:00:52.366 --> 00:00:53.266
Are you going?

27
00:00:53.266 --> 00:00:54.566
If you don't leave, I'll call security

28
00:00:54.566 --> 00:00:56.033
You still want to drive us away

29
00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:57.800
Hey, okay, okay.

30
00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.466
Let's go, girl.

31
00:00:59.466 --> 00:01:02.633
Can we go back and wait for your good news?

32
00:01:08.133 --> 00:01:09.400
Mr. Ji, why are you here?

33
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.000
How can I see this good show if I'm not here

34
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.000
It's not that you misunderstood

35
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.800
They're actually saying that's right.

36
00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:16.000
You are full of lies

37
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.866
Do whatever it takes to get there

38
00:01:17.866 --> 00:01:19.500
Mr. Ji, do you have any misunderstanding about me?

39
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.000
Misunderstand me, I think I underestimated you.

40
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:22.966
You want to get close to me

41
00:01:22.966 --> 00:01:24.066
There is a dead man ahead

42
00:01:24.066 --> 00:01:26.000
The person who made a crazy couple for himself

43
00:01:26.266 --> 00:01:28.333
Make up one lie at a time I didn't

44
00:01:28.333 --> 00:01:31.100
You dare to say that you approach me for no other purpose

45
00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.333
I admit I didn't give up

46
00:01:34.333 --> 00:01:35.866
I will fantasize about you as Xiuyuan

47
00:01:35.866 --> 00:01:37.266
But I actually have enough

48
00:01:37.266 --> 00:01:38.600
The same lie again

49
00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:39.500
Su Ran

50
00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.366
You and I only have work from now on and nothing else
