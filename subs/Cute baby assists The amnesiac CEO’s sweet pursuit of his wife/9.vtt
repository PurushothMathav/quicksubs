1
00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.466
Xiuyuan is you

2
00:00:02.733 --> 00:00:05.866
Why do you treat me as your guest again? I don't have it.

3
00:00:08.566 --> 00:00:10.200
It's actually an employee of our company

4
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.166
Liu Yang, when will our company recruit?

5
00:00:12.166 --> 00:00:13.466
The threshold is so low

6
00:00:13.466 --> 00:00:14.300
Recruit anyone?

7
00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:15.400
Su Ran hasn't come in yet

8
00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:16.766
If you don't come in, you'll be late.

9
00:00:24.733 --> 00:00:26.166
What about Su Ran?

10
00:00:26.166 --> 00:00:28.100
Mr. Ji, the president of our company

11
00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:28.966
My name is Ji Yanting

12
00:00:28.966 --> 00:00:29.933
You have to remember

13
00:00:29.933 --> 00:00:31.233
Don't ever forget that.

14
00:00:32.366 --> 00:00:34.200
Remember, this is Su Ran.

15
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.466
Not only our company employees

16
00:00:35.466 --> 00:00:36.566
Still my college classmate

17
00:00:36.566 --> 00:00:38.100
He is also a small employee in a company

18
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.233
No need to introduce me

19
00:00:48.133 --> 00:00:50.900
Did he really mistake me for someone else?

20
00:01:02.333 --> 00:01:03.133
Guan Yingying

21
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.933
Why is Mr. Ji so similar to Xu Yuan?

22
00:01:05.933 --> 00:01:07.500
Do you know what their relationship is?

23
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.800
Su Ran, you are not qualified to mention Brother Xu Yuan

24
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.866
Brother Xu Yuan wouldn't have died if it wasn't for you

25
00:01:11.866 --> 00:01:13.300
This slap is a warning to you

26
00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:14.500
Stay away from construction

27
00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:15.533
He is not Hu Xiuyuan

28
00:01:15.533 --> 00:01:16.600
He's mine.

29
00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:18.466
Otherwise, don't blame me for being rude to you.

30
00:01:18.466 --> 00:01:19.766
What about Enze?
