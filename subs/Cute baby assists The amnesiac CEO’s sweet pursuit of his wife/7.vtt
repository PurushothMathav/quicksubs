00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.900
Uncle handsome, this is my mother's design

2
00:00:05.933 --> 00:00:07.733
You must accept my mother

3
00:00:07.733 --> 00:00:09.300
He's very talented.

4
00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:12.100
The little uncle has something to do first

5
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.433
See you.

6
00:00:15.266 --> 00:00:17.000
Hello, this is my resume.

7
00:00:18.366 --> 00:00:20.266
Guan Yingying Su Shan

8
00:00:20.466 --> 00:00:21.833
Why did he come for the interview?

9
00:00:21.966 --> 00:00:24.766
Could he know that Yan Ting is a cultivator?

10
00:00:25.266 --> 00:00:26.366
Hey, you don't remember me.

11
00:00:26.366 --> 00:00:27.466
I'm Su Ran.

12
00:00:27.766 --> 00:00:30.166
No, I will never let Su Ran

13
00:00:30.166 --> 00:00:31.800
There is a chance to get close to Brother Yan Ting

14
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:33.200
We are college classmates

15
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.666
Back in college?

16
00:00:34.666 --> 00:00:36.500
Our Miss Su is an interview

17
00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.366
It's not a party with old classmates

18
00:00:38.366 --> 00:00:39.266
Excuse me?

19
00:00:39.266 --> 00:00:40.766
I was so excited.

20
00:00:41.466 --> 00:00:42.733
Miss Su, please come back

21
00:00:42.733 --> 00:00:44.400
You were passed

22
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:45.300
Why is that?

23
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.266
You haven't read my resume yet

24
00:00:46.266 --> 00:00:48.266
You don't meet the requirements for our interview

25
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:49.400
Next

26
00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.033
Your company hires so hastily

27
00:00:52.266 --> 00:00:53.800
Companies like this can't help but

28
00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.900
How was the interview, mom?

29
00:01:02.666 --> 00:01:03.700
Not so good.

30
00:01:05.166 --> 00:01:08.133
It's all my fault if it wasn't for me

31
00:01:08.133 --> 00:01:12.233
Mom doesn't have to work so hard to find a job

32
00:01:12.566 --> 00:01:13.900
What are you thinking?

33
00:01:13.966 --> 00:01:15.700
This one doesn't work, there's another one.

34
00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:17.100
Don't worry.

35
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.700
Mom will keep working hard, okay?

36
00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:20.166
All right, Mum.

37
00:01:20.166 --> 00:01:21.500
Let's go then. Hmm.

38
00:01:23.166 --> 00:01:25.100
Susan actually has a child

39
00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.033
Is it a cultivation class?

40
00:01:28.766 --> 00:01:31.600
No, I'm going to figure it out.
