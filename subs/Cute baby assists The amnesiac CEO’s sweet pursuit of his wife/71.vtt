00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:01.100
Don't worry.

2
00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:02.966
There's someone you need to meet

3
00:00:03.166 --> 00:00:05.333
Daughter, please save your brother

4
00:00:05.333 --> 00:00:06.866
Your brother was caught by them

5
00:00:06.866 --> 00:00:08.800
They say if you don't spend ten million

6
00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.500
They only have ten million

7
00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:11.333
What to pay

8
00:00:11.333 --> 00:00:12.566
I give my life to them

9
00:00:14.966 --> 00:00:16.766
Mr. Ji, please

10
00:00:16.766 --> 00:00:18.266
Please help us

11
00:00:18.266 --> 00:00:19.266
Please mom

12
00:00:19.266 --> 00:00:21.066
Don't embarrass yourself here

13
00:00:21.266 --> 00:00:22.933
The money for monitoring did not come from the strong wind.

14
00:00:22.933 --> 00:00:24.500
Why pay my brother back?

15
00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.166
Su Ran, you step into a wealthy family by yourself

16
00:00:27.166 --> 00:00:29.333
You forgot your parents when you turned around, didn't you?

17
00:00:29.333 --> 00:00:31.600
How did I give birth to such a heartless thing as you?

18
00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:32.400
You are now

19
00:00:33.366 --> 00:00:34.233
Don't rob

20
00:00:36.466 --> 00:00:37.400
10 million here

21
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:38.933
Take the money and let it go

22
00:00:38.933 --> 00:00:40.266
Otherwise, you look good.

23
00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:42.333
The boss is cheerful

24
00:00:42.333 --> 00:00:43.433
Boss atmosphere

25
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:44.466
Don't worry boss

26
00:00:44.766 --> 00:00:46.700
I'll let him go

27
00:00:49.533 --> 00:00:50.700
Thank you Mr. Ji

28
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.100
Thank you for saving us

29
00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.966
Thanks. I'll pay you back. Okay.

30
00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:56.466
But why?

31
00:00:56.733 --> 00:00:58.033
It's what I say

32
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.433
10 million ancestors don't even blink an eye

33
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.133
Oh, my daughter.

34
00:01:08.133 --> 00:01:11.500
It's lucky from now on

35
00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:12.866
Die this heart

36
00:01:12.866 --> 00:01:15.200
He's going to get married soon.

37
00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:18.866
Listen for you and pay him back

38
00:01:21.533 --> 00:01:24.766
Looks like I'm going to have to take some serious medicine
