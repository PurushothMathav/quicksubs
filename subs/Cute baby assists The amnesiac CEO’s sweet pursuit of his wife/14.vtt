00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:02.900
Why are you crazy? You are the crazy person, right?

2
00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:04.966
Su Ran, don't think I don't know what you're thinking

3
00:00:04.966 --> 00:00:06.366
I'll tell you again.

4
00:00:06.366 --> 00:00:07.600
Gu Xiuyan is dead

5
00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:08.566
He is Ji Yanting

6
00:00:08.566 --> 00:00:09.700
He's mine.

7
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.100
How dare you stay in a hotel?

8
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:13.266
Yontei Miyano, you heard it all

9
00:00:13.266 --> 00:00:15.366
You listen to me don't explain to me I tell you

10
00:00:15.366 --> 00:00:16.666
And then turn a deaf ear to my warning.

11
00:00:16.666 --> 00:00:19.100
I told you to get out of the Shengfeng Group

12
00:00:23.166 --> 00:00:25.200
Hello baby take plan display

13
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:26.833
Nice dance

14
00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:29.800
You are not feeling well

15
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.300
You go back to rest first

16
00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.833
I'll go back at noon to see if you're okay. Um, bye.

17
00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.033
Go!

18
00:00:39.866 --> 00:00:41.700
Su Ran, your first day at work today

19
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.133
The lunch break can be extended by one hour.

20
00:00:43.133 --> 00:00:45.200
Just go back to the office at 2pm, really?

21
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.600
Well, thank you, sir.

22
00:00:47.533 --> 00:00:49.166
Then I'll work first. Hmm.

23
00:00:55.066 --> 00:00:56.300
Mr. Ji, this is the afternoon meeting

24
00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:57.600
I have sorted out the information.

25
00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.833
Please take a look. Isn't this Su Soft's job?

26
00:00:59.866 --> 00:01:02.133
As soon as he receives a call from his boyfriend

27
00:01:02.133 --> 00:01:02.800
This is the siesta.

28
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.533
I haven't come back home yet.

29
00:01:04.533 --> 00:01:07.000
Yes, Mr. Ji, this pedestrian is not reliable at all

30
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.266
On the first day of work, I obviously have a boyfriend

31
00:01:09.266 --> 00:01:11.666
I'm still asking other colleagues about your situation everywhere

32
00:01:11.666 --> 00:01:12.900
Ask me what's going on.

33
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.033
Just a few of your personal details

34
00:01:15.133 --> 00:01:17.733
What's your family background, what's your income?

35
00:01:17.733 --> 00:01:19.033
Assets in the name or something

36
00:01:19.266 --> 00:01:20.700
Why is he so strange?

37
00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.066
He is here to work.

38
00:01:22.066 --> 00:01:23.600
It's not enough to perfunctory men

39
00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:25.100
You go out to work first

40
00:01:26.733 --> 00:01:29.800
Which face of Susan is the real you?
