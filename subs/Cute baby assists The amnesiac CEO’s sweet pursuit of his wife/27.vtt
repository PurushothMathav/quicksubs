00:00:00.066 --> 00:00:01.400
Of course you are

2
00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:02.366
Don't speak directly

3
00:00:02.366 --> 00:00:04.033
We have to fight

4
00:00:05.333 --> 00:00:07.700
I'm going to melt if I don't eat ice cream anymore

5
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.333
Why do you ask my sister silently?

6
00:00:10.333 --> 00:00:11.333
I have a friend

7
00:00:11.333 --> 00:00:12.933
There used to be a woman who took the initiative towards him

8
00:00:12.933 --> 00:00:14.866
But now suddenly ignore people

9
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:16.300
What's going on here?

10
00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:19.000
Why are you disappointed with you?

11
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.300
I'm disappointed.

12
00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:21.900
Hey not me

13
00:00:22.133 --> 00:00:22.766
My friend.

14
00:00:22.766 --> 00:00:24.800
Say it's a friend, but it's actually yourself

15
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.300
Of course you're in trouble

16
00:00:26.566 --> 00:00:28.266
Godfather, you don't understand women?

17
00:00:28.266 --> 00:00:31.200
That aunt is obviously disappointed in you.

18
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:32.133
Then what shall I do?

19
00:00:32.133 --> 00:00:33.200
Of course it's an apology

20
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.033
Admit your mistake and coax her

21
00:00:35.266 --> 00:00:37.133
But it's useless for me to apologize. How can I be stupid?

22
00:00:37.133 --> 00:00:38.966
Say whatever he likes to hear

23
00:00:38.966 --> 00:00:40.000
Come a few more times

24
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.566
Every time I steal ice cream and my mother finds me

25
00:00:42.566 --> 00:00:43.900
Mom would spank me

26
00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:45.333
I said I love her very much

27
00:00:45.333 --> 00:00:46.366
She is beautiful.

28
00:00:46.366 --> 00:00:48.966
More beautiful than the mothers of all the children in kindergarten

29
00:00:48.966 --> 00:00:51.466
If you coax her more, she won't spank me

30
00:00:52.966 --> 00:00:54.500
Then dad, I should go

31
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.133
If my mother finds out that I have secretly escaped from kindergarten

32
00:00:57.133 --> 00:00:58.100
I'm dead

33
00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.000
See you next time, wait, I'll send it to you.

34
00:01:00.666 --> 00:01:02.200
The little devil runs so fast

35
00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.400
Eating ice cream in the park and watching beautiful women

36
00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:05.966
Mr. Ji, this is TAG Heuer

37
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.166
Did I offend you again?

38
00:01:08.166 --> 00:01:10.333
If so, I apologize to you. No.

39
00:01:10.333 --> 00:01:11.633
Even if there is, you don't need it.

40
00:01:12.333 --> 00:01:13.166
Wait a minute.
