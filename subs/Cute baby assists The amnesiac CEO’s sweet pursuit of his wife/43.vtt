00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:02.500
Dad, I see you are in a bad mood too.

2
00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:04.400
Are you also brokenhearted?

3
00:00:05.066 --> 00:00:07.166
That's just right, handsome dad, you're broken in love too.

4
00:00:07.166 --> 00:00:08.533
My mom is also brokenhearted

5
00:00:08.533 --> 00:00:10.833
Why don't you stay with my mother?

6
00:00:12.466 --> 00:00:14.066
Adult emotions are complex

7
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.466
We can't be together if we lose together

8
00:00:17.066 --> 00:00:19.133
Okay, I have to go first

9
00:00:19.133 --> 00:00:21.000
We'll talk another day. Hmm.

10
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:22.966
Bye. Bye.

11
00:00:23.733 --> 00:00:25.300
Mr. Li should think about it again

12
00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.000
This is a key project of our company

13
00:00:27.266 --> 00:00:28.400
Thank you, please sign

14
00:00:30.366 --> 00:00:31.433
How are you in the company?

15
00:00:31.533 --> 00:00:32.633
Body recovered

16
00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:33.766
Thank you Mr. Ji for your concern

17
00:00:33.766 --> 00:00:35.466
I'm much better, don't think too much about it.

18
00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:36.600
I don't care about you.

19
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.300
I'm afraid you'll bring the virus to the company

20
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:39.466
Infect others

21
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:41.366
Got it, Mr. Ji

22
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.666
This lady is the new assistant.

23
00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:45.700
This lady

24
00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:47.266
Do you want to participate in my evening with Mr. Ji?

25
00:00:47.266 --> 00:00:47.900
What about the banquet?

26
00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:48.666
No, nothing else.

27
00:00:48.666 --> 00:00:50.500
I don't think I have time, so I won't go.

28
00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:51.800
Since Mr. Li has spoken

29
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:52.966
We will definitely go

30
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.366
Okay, let's eat and talk tonight

31
00:00:56.366 --> 00:00:57.400
Cooperation thing

32
00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:58.766
See you tonight

33
00:01:02.966 --> 00:01:04.066
Why should I go?

34
00:01:07.333 --> 00:01:08.866
Are you pretending to be confused?

35
00:01:10.066 --> 00:01:11.966
Mr. Li is my important client

36
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.366
You'd better do well tonight

37
00:01:14.366 --> 00:01:15.400
Don't wear it so ugly

38
00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:16.366
Shame me on me

39
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.866
Yan Ting, did you do this to me on purpose?
