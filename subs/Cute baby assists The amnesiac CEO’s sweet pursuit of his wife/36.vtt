00:00:00.066 --> 00:00:00.933
I didn't expect you to be so far

2
00:00:00.933 --> 00:00:02.133
The heart is still full of common cultivation yuan

3
00:00:02.133 --> 00:00:04.866
Listen to me, Su She explained, you really know how to act?

4
00:00:04.866 --> 00:00:06.166
You're hurting me.

5
00:00:06.166 --> 00:00:07.300
Do you take me for a fool?

6
00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:08.400
You are Su Shou

7
00:00:08.566 --> 00:00:10.300
Is it a misunderstanding that you have children?

8
00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:12.000
You take my biological sample for a paternity test

9
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.033
Is this also a misunderstanding?

10
00:00:13.733 --> 00:00:14.766
I have kids

11
00:00:14.766 --> 00:00:16.466
I didn't mean to hide it from you.

12
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.466
I wanted to tell you, listen to me

13
00:00:19.666 --> 00:00:21.966
Are you looking for me to find a father for your child?

14
00:00:21.966 --> 00:00:23.200
Find yourself some comfort

15
00:00:23.733 --> 00:00:24.800
From start to finish

16
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.566
I just developed a double together

17
00:00:26.566 --> 00:00:27.600
A joke.

18
00:00:29.133 --> 00:00:31.466
Why don't you explain it?

19
00:00:38.333 --> 00:00:40.300
What I still care about is this perfume.

20
00:00:43.066 --> 00:00:44.400
I'm so sorry.

21
00:00:44.666 --> 00:00:46.900
I shouldn't have given you this birthday present

22
00:00:47.133 --> 00:00:49.133
You tell me what I can do

23
00:00:49.133 --> 00:00:50.800
You are not angry, okay?

24
00:00:51.266 --> 00:00:52.633
I changed my mind.

25
00:00:53.166 --> 00:00:55.100
I'll still let you participate in the wine-making program

26
00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:56.366
But from now on

27
00:00:56.366 --> 00:00:58.066
You must obey me unconditionally

28
00:00:59.533 --> 00:01:01.066
This is what you owe me

29
00:01:02.866 --> 00:01:04.900
Why are you hesitating?

30
00:01:05.066 --> 00:01:07.600
Or do you like richer?

31
00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:08.833
I don't want money.

32
00:01:09.333 --> 00:01:11.233
I can't tell the difference between your tears now

33
00:01:11.533 --> 00:01:12.466
Is for you

34
00:01:13.333 --> 00:01:14.666
It's still Gu Xiaojuan.

35
00:01:14.866 --> 00:01:16.400
I'll do whatever you say.

36
00:01:16.666 --> 00:01:19.800
I will listen to whatever you say, okay?

37
00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.300
Yan Ting, are you alright?
