00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.500
This dress was given to me by Mr. Ji.

2
00:00:02.866 --> 00:00:04.766
You are so full of lies!

3
00:00:04.766 --> 00:00:06.700
This dress is clearly only one in the world

4
00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:08.566
It's the engagement dress I gave to Yingying

5
00:00:08.566 --> 00:00:11.066
Your piece is clearly a counterfeit.

6
00:00:11.133 --> 00:00:13.466
How could we Yanting give away counterfeit goods?

7
00:00:14.766 --> 00:00:16.766
Then I won't disturb everyone's Yaxing

8
00:00:16.966 --> 00:00:20.533
I'm sorry I left first, do you still want to go?

9
00:00:20.533 --> 00:00:21.766
Vehicles with iron stalls

10
00:00:21.766 --> 00:00:23.133
It's really hard to say

11
00:00:23.133 --> 00:00:25.766
What kind of person wears what kind of clothes?

12
00:00:25.766 --> 00:00:27.900
Su Ran, do you think you are wearing a high imitation?

13
00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.800
Will people look up at you?

14
00:00:29.866 --> 00:00:31.300
What do you compare with Yingying?

15
00:00:31.366 --> 00:00:32.800
Don't embarrass yourself here

16
00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.100
Someone please ask Miss Su out

17
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.600
No, I can go by myself.

18
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.566
Don't you think it's too much to bully people like this?

19
00:00:43.866 --> 00:00:44.500
Yan Ting

20
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.466
This banquet is for the two of us

21
00:00:46.466 --> 00:00:47.600
You can't leave me

22
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.300
What are you?

23
00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.400
Yan Ting, are you really going to do it for this woman?

24
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.100
Give up the engagement with grandpa?

25
00:00:57.566 --> 00:00:59.500
Susan, you made me lose face

26
00:00:59.666 --> 00:01:01.066
I will no longer be merciful to you

27
00:01:02.466 --> 00:01:04.066
Get in the car and I'll take you back

28
00:01:04.066 --> 00:01:07.766
No need, I'll take a taxi by myself, don't force me to get in the car

29
00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:13.100
keep up
