00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:01.566
That would be a big problem

2
00:00:01.566 --> 00:00:03.066
You almost got it.

3
00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:05.633
We are obviously Su Lin, stop talking

4
00:00:06.733 --> 00:00:09.400
Guan Yingying, I apologize to you for my child.

5
00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:10.933
Sorry, Mom.

6
00:00:10.933 --> 00:00:12.633
I'm not lying.

7
00:00:12.766 --> 00:00:14.066
Mom believes in you

8
00:00:14.066 --> 00:00:15.300
But you have to remember

9
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:17.100
Stop calling people dad casually

10
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.633
Do you have a father?

11
00:00:19.566 --> 00:00:20.366
Come on.

12
00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.700
Why don't you let me say MOMO?

13
00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:34.966
It's Xiuyuan's child

14
00:00:34.966 --> 00:00:36.166
He's gone.

15
00:00:36.166 --> 00:00:37.500
What's the point of all this?

16
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.100
Su Ran Sunjian

17
00:00:39.533 --> 00:00:40.800
Is there something wrong with you?

18
00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:41.800
Long time no see.

19
00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.200
I heard you are working as a designer

20
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.400
What about designers?

21
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.400
I am now an assistant at Shengfeng Group

22
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:48.466
Shengfeng Group

23
00:00:48.533 --> 00:00:50.333
With your great talent, you didn't do design

24
00:00:50.333 --> 00:00:52.566
What a pity, oh yeah

25
00:00:54.133 --> 00:00:55.233
Here's my card.

26
00:00:55.333 --> 00:00:56.800
If you want to do design in the future

27
00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.066
Come find me anytime

28
00:00:58.066 --> 00:01:00.366
Our company is doing an early warning bend project

29
00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:01.300
Just confirm less

30
00:01:02.666 --> 00:01:04.800
Okay, Sister Sun is doing well.

31
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.400
Everyone has their own office

32
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:07.700
I'm not the same as before

33
00:01:07.733 --> 00:01:08.900
What do you need?

34
00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:10.400
Find me anytime

35
00:01:10.466 --> 00:01:11.700
I can help you.

36
00:01:12.366 --> 00:01:13.300
Thank you Sun Jian

37
00:01:13.666 --> 00:01:16.166
But I don't need your help yet.

38
00:01:17.166 --> 00:01:18.433
You're still the same

39
00:01:18.733 --> 00:01:19.966
Call me to know a thousand miles

40
00:01:19.966 --> 00:01:21.366
Um, sorry.

41
00:01:21.366 --> 00:01:22.200
That's okay.

42
00:01:22.266 --> 00:01:24.266
Call me anytime you need it.

43
00:01:24.266 --> 00:01:26.266
Well, I'll go back first.

44
00:01:26.266 --> 00:01:28.100
Well, bye Mengmeng, bye mom

45
00:01:28.733 --> 00:01:32.566
Mom, that uncle doesn't want to be my dad, does he?
