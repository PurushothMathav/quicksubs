00:00:00.466 --> 00:00:02.566
Jin Ting, the 10th of next month is a good day.

2
00:00:02.566 --> 00:00:04.800
Otherwise, our wedding will be scheduled for that day

3
00:00:09.366 --> 00:00:11.000
This is too coincidental

4
00:00:11.066 --> 00:00:13.466
This Sun Jian accompanied Su Ran to the hospital again

5
00:00:13.466 --> 00:00:14.600
I accompanied him to dinner again

6
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.600
It seems that Su Ran is looking at the child's face

7
00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:17.966
The old relationship with Sun Jian was rekindled

8
00:00:17.966 --> 00:00:19.100
Don't talk nonsense

9
00:00:19.333 --> 00:00:21.566
Yan Ting, do you know why Su Ran

10
00:00:21.566 --> 00:00:22.733
His mother didn't want him and Sun Jian

11
00:00:22.733 --> 00:00:23.400
Are you together?

12
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.533
I'm not interested in knowing

13
00:00:24.533 --> 00:00:27.366
His mother wanted his daughter to marry into a wealthy family

14
00:00:27.366 --> 00:00:29.733
It's a pity that it was ruined by Sun Jian

15
00:00:29.733 --> 00:00:31.000
I also brought a tow bottle

16
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.500
This wealthy family was smashed to pieces

17
00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.366
His mother hates Sun Jian to the core now

18
00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.066
It turns out that Su Ran's son is Sun Jian's

19
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.800
No wonder Sun Jian has always missed him

20
00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:44.933
Ah, Yan Ting, stop drinking

21
00:00:44.933 --> 00:00:46.033
To be drunk

22
00:00:47.966 --> 00:00:50.300
It's not up to you to take care of this

23
00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:51.266
Since you want to drink

24
00:00:51.266 --> 00:00:53.500
Then I'll ask the waiter to bring all your wine

25
00:01:01.966 --> 00:01:03.366
After tonight

26
00:01:03.366 --> 00:01:06.500
Yan Ting belongs to me completely
