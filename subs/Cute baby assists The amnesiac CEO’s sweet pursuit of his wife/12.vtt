00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.366
How dare you hide from me?

2
00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:06.600
New here I have a name not new here

3
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.166
It's not my job to pour you coffee

4
00:00:08.166 --> 00:00:09.266
I don't have to serve you

5
00:00:09.266 --> 00:00:10.066
you

6
00:00:10.766 --> 00:00:12.433
How dare you contradict me

7
00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:15.000
A newcomer doesn't deserve me to call him by his name

8
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.366
Forget it, Shin Shin

9
00:00:16.666 --> 00:00:18.600
He didn't even care about me

10
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:19.766
Not to mention you

11
00:00:19.766 --> 00:00:21.566
This newcomer is so arrogant

12
00:00:21.766 --> 00:00:22.566
Doesn't he know?

13
00:00:22.566 --> 00:00:24.366
Miss Guan is for his president's wife

14
00:00:24.366 --> 00:00:25.366
Offend Miss Guan

15
00:00:25.366 --> 00:00:27.166
See how he will still manage in the company in the future

16
00:00:27.166 --> 00:00:28.300
Get out sooner or later

17
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.966
If I don't give him some color, it's a coincidence

18
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.100
He doesn't know how many eyes the horse king has

19
00:00:36.366 --> 00:00:37.500
Look at what you did

20
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.200
This is a gift from the customer to Mr. Ji.

21
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.266
Can you afford it if it breaks now?

22
00:00:43.066 --> 00:00:44.466
Can he break if you don't hit me?

23
00:00:44.466 --> 00:00:45.500
If you want to pay, you will pay.

24
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.100
Who saw me bump into you?

25
00:00:47.166 --> 00:00:47.900
Su Ran

26
00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:51.366
You dare to slander me in order to shirk responsibility?

27
00:00:51.366 --> 00:00:54.366
I didn't see any of you who saw me hit him.

28
00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:58.200
Who else saw it?

29
00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.200
Su Ran, is this wrong?

30
00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:01.533
You can't pass the buck.

31
00:01:01.533 --> 00:01:02.966
You also passed it on to your colleagues

32
00:01:02.966 --> 00:01:05.400
Besides, it was given by an important customer.

33
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.500
What do you want me to do with my ancestors? You don't have to tell me.
