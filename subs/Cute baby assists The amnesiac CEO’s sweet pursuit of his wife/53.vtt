00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.366
Su Ran, you bitch

2
00:00:07.766 --> 00:00:09.366
You follow the picture I sent you.

3
00:00:09.366 --> 00:00:11.100
Find an identical dress

4
00:00:11.166 --> 00:00:14.200
Delivered to Suoran's house in the name of Mr. Ji

5
00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:19.100
There will be a good show tomorrow

6
00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.800
I have long heard of Mrs. Ji's beauty

7
00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.300
I am privileged to meet you today

8
00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:26.466
Really elegant

9
00:00:26.466 --> 00:00:27.433
graceful

10
00:00:27.533 --> 00:00:28.466
I don't know.

11
00:00:28.466 --> 00:00:29.800
I thought it was Mr. Ji's sister

12
00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.666
Thank you, Mrs. Ji, there are no shelves at all

13
00:00:32.666 --> 00:00:35.700
Inviting company employees to a dinner party as soon as they returned to China

14
00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.366
We are so flattered

15
00:00:37.366 --> 00:00:40.000
I asked you all to come here today for one thing

16
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.900
It's about us Yanting and Yingying

17
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:44.866
No wonder Yingying is so beautiful today

18
00:00:44.866 --> 00:00:47.466
Yingying, are you a proper protagonist today?

19
00:00:47.766 --> 00:00:49.166
This is all the service of Aunt Toji

20
00:00:49.166 --> 00:00:51.466
My clothes were given to me by Aunt Ji.

21
00:00:51.466 --> 00:00:53.500
There is only one item in the world. Wow.

22
00:00:53.933 --> 00:00:55.466
Happy people spoil you too much, right?

23
00:00:55.466 --> 00:00:57.400
I almost treat you like my own daughter

24
00:00:58.066 --> 00:01:00.233
Hey, it's flat.

25
00:01:02.933 --> 00:01:04.933
Why did Su Ran wear the same clothes as Yingying?

26
00:01:04.933 --> 00:01:05.800
Yes!

27
00:01:07.066 --> 00:01:08.200
Su Ran is too much

28
00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.133
On this occasion

29
00:01:09.133 --> 00:01:10.600
Wear the same clothes as Yingying

30
00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.466
Obviously want to steal Yingying's thunder

31
00:01:12.666 --> 00:01:14.066
Su Ran is an idiot

32
00:01:14.066 --> 00:01:16.066
I really thought it was Yan Ting who gave her the dress

33
00:01:16.133 --> 00:01:17.700
Now I'm curious

34
00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.166
Hey, why is this Su Ran like this?

35
00:01:20.166 --> 00:01:21.600
I showed him my clothes yesterday

36
00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:22.533
He boasted about his good looks

37
00:01:22.533 --> 00:01:24.600
I didn't expect to wear a counterfeit

38
00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:25.600
Su Ran

39
00:01:26.533 --> 00:01:27.766
Where did this dress come from?

40
00:01:27.766 --> 00:01:30.266
This dress was given to me by Mr. Ji.
