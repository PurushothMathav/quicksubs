00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.533
Yingying, you have crossed the line, since I have crossed the line

2
00:00:03.533 --> 00:00:04.866
Then punish me.

3
00:00:05.533 --> 00:00:07.000
Before I get mad

4
00:00:07.166 --> 00:00:08.000
Leave quickly

5
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.800
Why is that?

6
00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.800
Why haven't you been willing to touch me for so many years?

7
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:11.900
Humph

8
00:00:16.266 --> 00:00:18.633
Ah, finally it's done.

9
00:00:18.933 --> 00:00:20.033
What are you doing?

10
00:00:20.066 --> 00:00:22.033
Why don't you go back so late?

11
00:00:22.533 --> 00:00:23.200
Broken

12
00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.500
If the crew finds out, I will secretly design the drawings

13
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:26.666
Will definitely scold me

14
00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:31.400
I'm sorting out tomorrow's meeting materials hum

15
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:32.666
I can't even install it.

16
00:00:32.766 --> 00:00:33.800
Lie again

17
00:00:34.466 --> 00:00:35.433
Ah you don't

18
00:00:59.766 --> 00:01:00.700
Sorry.

19
00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.566
I treat you as Xiuyuan again

20
00:01:03.266 --> 00:01:05.400
It's okay, I don't blame you.

21
00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:07.800
I also take you for someone else

22
00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:12.900
Why so stupid

23
00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.233
Always wrong

24
00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:18.766
Sun Qian, why are you here?

25
00:01:18.766 --> 00:01:19.900
I'm waiting for you to get off work.

26
00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:21.200
What's up?

27
00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.866
I heard your company is running a design submission campaign

28
00:01:25.066 --> 00:01:27.300
The winner can participate in the Royal Bay project

29
00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.233
Su Ran I hope

30
00:01:29.666 --> 00:01:30.800
Don't give up on design

31
00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:32.066
You must go!

32
00:01:32.166 --> 00:01:33.133
Thanks.

33
00:01:33.133 --> 00:01:34.400
I have already submitted

34
00:01:34.533 --> 00:01:35.333
Really?

35
00:01:35.933 --> 00:01:36.800
That's fine.

36
00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.633
So we can work together

37
00:01:38.766 --> 00:01:39.566
OK

38
00:01:39.866 --> 00:01:42.433
I'll send you away. Walk

39
00:01:44.566 --> 00:01:46.400
Hmph Su Ran

40
00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.966
Do you want to participate in the Royal Police Officer's project?
