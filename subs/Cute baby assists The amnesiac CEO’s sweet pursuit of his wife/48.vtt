00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.966
He is not only Yan Ting's assistant now

2
00:00:01.966 --> 00:00:03.600
Jianting also let him participate in the project of Yujingwan

3
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.466
What? Why didn't you tell me?

4
00:00:05.466 --> 00:00:08.100
This bitch is really haunted

5
00:00:08.133 --> 00:00:09.800
Brother Jiu is still playing with Yan Ting's idea

6
00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:11.900
I won't let him go

7
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:15.466
This is my resignation report

8
00:00:15.466 --> 00:00:16.833
I don't agree with you resigning

9
00:00:17.966 --> 00:00:20.100
If you don't agree, I won't come to work.

10
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.266
I won't stop you.

11
00:00:21.266 --> 00:00:22.733
You left without saying hello yesterday

12
00:00:22.733 --> 00:00:23.700
Offended Mr. Li

13
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:25.700
Let the company lose an important customer

14
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.266
How do you compensate for this loss?

15
00:00:27.266 --> 00:00:28.966
Obviously you forced me to pull

16
00:00:28.966 --> 00:00:30.700
Why should I bear the loss?

17
00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:33.200
What do you have to prove that I took you away?

18
00:00:33.533 --> 00:00:34.366
Not much compensation

19
00:00:34.366 --> 00:00:34.933
Just one billion.

20
00:00:34.933 --> 00:00:36.566
If you can take it out

21
00:00:37.266 --> 00:00:38.700
I can let you go.

22
00:00:40.066 --> 00:00:40.966
Since he can't stand it

23
00:00:40.966 --> 00:00:42.566
You can pack up and leave

24
00:00:42.566 --> 00:00:45.866
Dear son, I haven't seen you for a few months, why are you suffering?

25
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.700
I'm sorry I can see one last time

26
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:51.966
Don't let me see you

27
00:00:51.966 --> 00:00:54.666
Otherwise I won't let you go easily

28
00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:56.566
You are back.

29
00:00:56.966 --> 00:00:59.366
Why is Jianting so close to Xiuyuan's mother?

30
00:00:59.966 --> 00:01:01.300
Is he
