Miss Su

2
00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:03.566
Why are you different from this photo?

3
00:00:03.566 --> 00:00:04.700
Is that right?

4
00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:06.866
That's how I usually dress for work, okay?

5
00:00:06.866 --> 00:00:08.766
When do you think we will register for marriage?

6
00:00:08.766 --> 00:00:10.300
I hope the sooner the better.

7
00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:11.166
You see, it's registered.

8
00:00:11.166 --> 00:00:12.966
You can help me take care of my son in the future

9
00:00:12.966 --> 00:00:14.900
And I don't have to work nights to make money.

10
00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:15.733
What are you

11
00:00:15.733 --> 00:00:16.566
You have a son?

12
00:00:16.566 --> 00:00:18.666
Yeah, my mom didn't tell you she's still young

13
00:00:18.666 --> 00:00:22.500
Son son mom mom come quickly

14
00:00:27.866 --> 00:00:30.800
It's sad that this child has such a mother.

15
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.466
Hello, call dad and grandpa, what's the matter with you?

16
00:00:34.466 --> 00:00:36.000
Didn't I tell you to call me dad?

17
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.733
Mr. Zhao, do you mind?

18
00:00:37.733 --> 00:00:38.466
After all

19
00:00:38.466 --> 00:00:40.966
That old son is also a new thing in life

20
00:00:41.066 --> 00:00:43.166
And I heard that your Zhao family has no heir

21
00:00:43.166 --> 00:00:44.633
It happens to be in the county seat.

22
00:00:44.866 --> 00:00:47.800
Nonsense, I'm here for a blind date, not to find relatives

23
00:00:48.933 --> 00:00:50.100
Hey, give it back to you

24
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.900
Hey, don't go

25
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:54.766
I really can't. When the child takes your last name

26
00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.700
Hahahaha

27
00:00:59.466 --> 00:01:00.100
What's your trouble?

28
00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:04.000
Mom, this is the 66th blind date you've screwed up

29
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.833
I'm afraid you'll be bullied again when you go back.

30
00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:08.900
Oh, don't worry.

31
00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:10.533
I promise, this is the last time

32
00:01:10.533 --> 00:01:11.066
Later?

33
00:01:11.066 --> 00:01:13.233
I will never be pushed around by them again, okay?

34
00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:16.166
Well, Mom, I just saw a handsome uncle.

35
00:01:16.166 --> 00:01:18.300
Can you let him be my dad?

36
00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.200
Didn't Mama Silent tell you?

37
00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.600
You only have one father.

38
00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:23.933
Although my father is gone

39
00:01:23.933 --> 00:01:27.000
But mom will continue to love you for dad, okay?

40
00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:28.100
OK

41
00:01:28.966 --> 00:01:29.766
good boy

42
00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:34.300
suddenly

43
00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:37.133
A blind date arranged for you by you useless thing

44
00:01:37.133 --> 00:01:38.500
You screwed him up again.

45
00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.600
Are you trying to piss me off?
