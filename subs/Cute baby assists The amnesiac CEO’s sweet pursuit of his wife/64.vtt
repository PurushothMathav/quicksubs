1
00:00:03.566 --> 00:00:04.400
fall in love

2
00:00:05.966 --> 00:00:06.800
fall in love

3
00:00:30.666 --> 00:00:32.700
And Susan looked at this picture.

4
00:00:32.766 --> 00:00:35.000
You should give up on Yan Ting, right?

5
00:00:39.333 --> 00:00:40.566
Mom, what's wrong with you?

6
00:00:40.566 --> 00:00:42.866
Did handsome dad bully you?

7
00:00:42.866 --> 00:00:45.466
No, my mother accidentally made it herself.

8
00:00:46.933 --> 00:00:48.133
And handsome dad?

9
00:00:48.133 --> 00:00:49.866
Why didn't he take you home?

10
00:00:49.866 --> 00:00:51.466
Is he still mad?

11
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:53.633
him

12
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.066
This -- this can't be true.

13
00:00:57.166 --> 00:00:58.166
How could this be?

14
00:00:58.166 --> 00:01:00.866
Mom, what's wrong?

15
00:01:10.466 --> 00:01:11.600
How could I survive my eyes?

16
00:01:11.866 --> 00:01:13.900
Impossible absolutely impossible

17
00:01:16.733 --> 00:01:18.233
Do you want it in court?

18
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.700
Ah what the hell is going on

19
00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.733
Yan Ting, did you forget yesterday?

20
00:01:23.733 --> 00:01:26.366
The more you drank last night, the more excited you were.

21
00:01:26.366 --> 00:01:27.800
Keep pulling me

22
00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.466
Said nothing and refused to go home

23
00:01:29.466 --> 00:01:30.433
That's not possible.

24
00:01:30.766 --> 00:01:33.266
I know my alcohol intake and taste

25
00:01:33.266 --> 00:01:35.400
Yan Ting, I'm lying to you when I hear what you mean.

26
00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:36.866
I belong to a girl's family

27
00:01:36.866 --> 00:01:38.466
How can you possibly take your innocence?

28
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.100
Don't worry, we're going to get married anyway.

29
00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.566
I will be responsible for you.
