00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:01.000
That's okay.

2
00:00:01.133 --> 00:00:03.333
It's very interesting that he speaks for you, Mr. Ji

3
00:00:03.333 --> 00:00:04.866
When I face unfair treatment

4
00:00:04.866 --> 00:00:06.400
You didn't stand up in time to argue for me

5
00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.100
Prove that someone else is helping me now

6
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:09.366
You dislike it's not me

7
00:00:09.366 --> 00:00:10.666
I was originally what

8
00:00:10.766 --> 00:00:12.866
Do you want to stand up for me or watch me make a fool of myself?

9
00:00:13.166 --> 00:00:14.466
That's really interesting.

10
00:00:21.066 --> 00:00:22.800
Why did you remember to contact me?

11
00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:24.033
What!

12
00:00:24.566 --> 00:00:27.066
Ok then I'll come back

13
00:00:30.066 --> 00:00:31.166
You said you took me out to play

14
00:00:31.166 --> 00:00:31.966
Why are you in a daze by the roadside?

15
00:00:31.966 --> 00:00:32.800
Not in a daze

16
00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:33.933
I am learning

17
00:00:33.933 --> 00:00:35.966
What to study

18
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.066
Learning how to fall in love

19
00:00:38.066 --> 00:00:39.333
Why are you learning this at a young age?

20
00:00:39.333 --> 00:00:41.266
I'm going to find myself a dad

21
00:00:41.266 --> 00:00:42.466
How's your education going?

22
00:00:42.933 --> 00:00:44.266
Look at that couple

23
00:00:44.266 --> 00:00:45.966
The uncle will chase after him immediately

24
00:00:45.966 --> 00:00:47.066
Hug that aunt

25
00:00:47.066 --> 00:00:49.066
The two will be fine soon.

26
00:00:50.166 --> 00:00:52.366
Oh, how did you know that?
