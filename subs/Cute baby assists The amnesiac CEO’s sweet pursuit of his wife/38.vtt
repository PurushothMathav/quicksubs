00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:00.900
President Qi

2
00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:02.766
Su Xiao has been handing out flyers for a few hours

3
00:00:02.766 --> 00:00:03.900
Didn't even drink a bottle of water

4
00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:06.366
I'm afraid his body can't take it anymore.

5
00:00:06.366 --> 00:00:07.333
You care so much about him

6
00:00:07.333 --> 00:00:09.766
Why don't you go and get angry for him? I was wrong, Mr. Qi.

7
00:00:11.133 --> 00:00:12.400
You go buy him a cup of milk tea.

8
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.666
Tell him he can get off work

9
00:00:19.366 --> 00:00:20.900
Miss Ji Zongsu fainted

10
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.166
Why are you here?

11
00:00:24.166 --> 00:00:25.400
Monitor too much

12
00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:26.533
How can I get you to hand out flyers?

13
00:00:26.533 --> 00:00:27.700
I don't want this job

14
00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.300
I'll take you to resign

15
00:00:29.466 --> 00:00:31.066
Su Ran, what are you doing?

16
00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:33.533
Although I asked you to work

17
00:00:33.533 --> 00:00:35.500
Instead of flirting with men, Jianjun

18
00:00:35.533 --> 00:00:36.566
I don't care what you say.

19
00:00:36.566 --> 00:00:37.933
But even though I'm your assistant now

20
00:00:37.933 --> 00:00:39.666
And he was the architect of Royal Bay.

21
00:00:39.666 --> 00:00:41.333
Distributing flyers is not in his job scope

22
00:00:41.333 --> 00:00:42.566
You know, he works for me.

23
00:00:42.566 --> 00:00:44.333
I can ask him to do whatever I want

24
00:00:44.333 --> 00:00:45.633
Don't go too far

25
00:00:46.533 --> 00:00:47.966
Sun Jian, thank you for thinking of me.

26
00:00:47.966 --> 00:00:48.800
Go away.

27
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.666
I'm not leaving. I can't just watch you get bullied

28
00:00:51.666 --> 00:00:53.366
I'm begging you, okay?

29
00:00:54.766 --> 00:00:56.033
Then take care of yourself

30
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:02.500
You can't even send a flyer.

31
00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.400
You don't want to do anything to worship your ancestors

32
00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:05.200
Don't worry.

33
00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:08.200
I will definitely hand out all the flyers today.

34
00:01:08.666 --> 00:01:09.400
One more thing.

35
00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:10.700
I need to travel this month

36
00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:11.866
All the materials are ready

37
00:01:11.866 --> 00:01:13.800
I want to see you before 12 o'clock.

38
00:01:20.266 --> 00:01:21.466
A few more hours

39
00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:22.766
Hurry up and finish the flyers

40
00:01:22.866 --> 00:01:23.966
It should be in time.
