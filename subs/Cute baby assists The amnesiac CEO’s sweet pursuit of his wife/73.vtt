00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.466
Yan Ting, I just checked it two days ago.

2
00:00:02.466 --> 00:00:04.066
You're so busy, don't accompany me

3
00:00:04.066 --> 00:00:06.400
You said it all before you got pregnant

4
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.200
I think it's more compromising to have a check

5
00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:09.100
Family? What do you mean?

6
00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:11.166
Do you think Yingying is pregnant?

7
00:00:11.333 --> 00:00:14.666
Yan Ting, I didn't expect you to suspect me of lying.

8
00:00:17.666 --> 00:00:19.000
This is the report form from the hospital.

9
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.233
It should be able to prove my innocence

10
00:00:23.933 --> 00:00:26.400
Yan Ting, how can you treat Yingying like this?

11
00:00:26.733 --> 00:00:28.066
He has been with you for so many years

12
00:00:28.066 --> 00:00:29.533
How could you doubt him?

13
00:00:29.533 --> 00:00:31.000
You must apologize to him.

14
00:00:34.066 --> 00:00:36.566
This kid is really spoiled by me

15
00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.166
Come sit Yingying

16
00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.166
Auntie, I don't blame Yan Ting

17
00:00:41.166 --> 00:00:43.566
Anyway, sooner or later we will all be family, right?

18
00:00:43.566 --> 00:00:44.666
Yingying, don't worry.

19
00:00:44.666 --> 00:00:45.866
Your stomach is so competitive

20
00:00:45.866 --> 00:00:47.566
Auntie will never let Yan Ting treat you badly.

21
00:00:47.566 --> 00:00:49.333
There's a private exhibition tomorrow.

22
00:00:49.333 --> 00:00:51.500
Come with me

23
00:00:53.133 --> 00:00:54.300
Help me push the art exhibition

24
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.266
I'm not interested

25
00:00:57.533 --> 00:01:00.000
Mr. Ji, please take a look at this document.

26
00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.866
Ah, are you going to see this art exhibition?

27
00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.866
His tickets are super hard to buy

28
00:01:06.866 --> 00:01:08.600
What's wrong? I'm a fan.

29
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.966
I didn't expect him to hold an art exhibition in China

30
00:01:13.066 --> 00:01:14.133
Why don't you go and participate?

31
00:01:14.133 --> 00:01:15.766
Mr. Ji, this exhibition is not open to the public

32
00:01:15.766 --> 00:01:18.000
Only invited celebrities can participate

33
00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.000
Wear something nice then. Hmm.

34
00:01:22.333 --> 00:01:24.200
Aren't you going to an art exhibition?

35
00:01:24.366 --> 00:01:25.600
I'm missing a significant other

36
00:01:25.766 --> 00:01:26.966
Can I come?

37
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:28.766
Thank you Mr. Ji

38
00:01:28.766 --> 00:01:29.566
Mr. Ji is you

39
00:01:29.566 --> 00:01:31.500
No one took you for a mute when you didn't speak just now

40
00:01:31.666 --> 00:01:33.200
It's Mr. Ji, I was wrong
