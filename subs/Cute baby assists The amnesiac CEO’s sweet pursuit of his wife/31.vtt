00:00:00.733 --> 00:00:03.566
A poor man like you is an eyesore

2
00:00:03.666 --> 00:00:04.900
It will ruin the good things in my family

3
00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:08.066
It turns out that Su Ran seduced and sent it away for money?

4
00:00:08.066 --> 00:00:09.100
Yeah.

5
00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:11.700
A mother that sucks blood can't raise any good people

6
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:12.533
What's up?

7
00:00:12.533 --> 00:00:14.966
Oh, are you an ancestor priest?

8
00:00:14.966 --> 00:00:16.666
I am Su Ran's mother

9
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.533
I heard Su Ran say that you see it today

10
00:00:19.533 --> 00:00:21.700
It's really extraordinary

11
00:00:21.933 --> 00:00:23.966
Mom, give up

12
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
They already have a fiancÃ©e

13
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.433
Su Ran is right

14
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.233
I am Yan Ting's fiancee

15
00:00:29.366 --> 00:00:31.766
Aunt Sun Jian and Su Ran were in college

16
00:00:31.766 --> 00:00:33.100
The relationship has always been good

17
00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.300
Now Sun Jian has a successful career

18
00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.266
I believe he is with Su Ran

19
00:00:37.266 --> 00:00:38.666
It will definitely be good to him.

20
00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:41.233
What's up?

21
00:00:41.866 --> 00:00:43.233
Don't talk. Come with me.

22
00:00:43.366 --> 00:00:45.566
Xinting, Su Ran and Sun Jian, Mr. Xie

23
00:00:45.733 --> 00:00:47.133
Su Ran and Sun Jian

24
00:00:47.133 --> 00:00:48.566
It doesn't matter.

25
00:00:48.566 --> 00:00:49.866
You take her away

26
00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:51.666
Ah Su Ran

27
00:00:51.766 --> 00:00:53.100
If you don't want to

28
00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.266
No one will force you

29
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:55.300
Including Memorial Ting

30
00:01:05.133 --> 00:01:06.866
Ouch, is that right?

31
00:01:06.866 --> 00:01:08.233
My good daughter

32
00:01:08.266 --> 00:01:11.166
How can you compare with the Human Sacrifice Sect in an instant?

33
00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:12.866
Ouch.

34
00:01:15.933 --> 00:01:17.000
What are you doing?

35
00:01:17.266 --> 00:01:19.233
What are you doing? I thought you had something to say.

36
00:01:38.366 --> 00:01:41.700
I admit that you and I were jealous when we were together

37
00:01:43.733 --> 00:01:45.066
You don't have to respond to me.

38
00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:46.700
But I want you to know that

39
00:01:47.733 --> 00:01:49.266
Then you can't do it either

40
00:01:49.333 --> 00:01:51.333
Locked door in conference room

41
00:01:51.333 --> 00:01:53.066
How do people come into the meeting?
