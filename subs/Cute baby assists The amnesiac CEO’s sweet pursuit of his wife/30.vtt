00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:01.066
laity

2
00:00:01.733 --> 00:00:03.666
Lay man, I gave birth to you and raised you

3
00:00:03.666 --> 00:00:06.200
It's not for you to be with this crap

4
00:00:09.666 --> 00:00:10.800
Hello Yan Ting

5
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.200
I'm in the lounge now.

6
00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.366
Can you come down and have coffee with me?

7
00:00:14.366 --> 00:00:16.266
I'll wait for you, Auntie Xu.

8
00:00:16.266 --> 00:00:17.900
How could you hit your own daughter?

9
00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:20.700
Who are you to interfere with our family affairs?

10
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:23.166
I didn't just hit her, I hit you too

11
00:00:23.166 --> 00:00:24.966
Auntie, please take care of yourself.

12
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.766
You are too embarrassed to say that

13
00:00:26.766 --> 00:00:29.666
Sun Jianjian doesn't pee, take care of yourself

14
00:00:29.933 --> 00:00:31.500
You are a dog plaster

15
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.900
Six years ago, you pestered our Su Ran

16
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:36.066
Are you still not dead?

17
00:00:36.466 --> 00:00:37.666
Do you want to marry Su Ran?

18
00:00:38.266 --> 00:00:42.066
Yes, unless you take out a tens of billions of betrothal gifts.

19
00:00:42.066 --> 00:00:45.700
Otherwise, it won't be your turn in your next life.

20
00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:46.900
How can you say that about him?

21
00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:48.333
There is nothing between me and Sun Jian

22
00:00:48.333 --> 00:00:49.866
Why are you so insulting?

23
00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:51.533
Sorry.

24
00:00:51.533 --> 00:00:53.533
I apologize to you for my mother.

25
00:00:53.533 --> 00:00:55.500
It's okay, it's not your problem.

26
00:00:56.333 --> 00:00:59.500
Aunt, I lost my ability 6 years ago

27
00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:00.733
But now I'm different

28
00:01:00.733 --> 00:01:02.266
Although I can't give a bride price of tens of billions

29
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:03.533
But I can guarantee it.

30
00:01:03.533 --> 00:01:05.233
Let Su Ran have worry-free food and clothing for a lifetime

31
00:01:05.333 --> 00:01:06.633
Hahahaha

32
00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.200
You still have no worries about food and clothing?

33
00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.200
I'm not you, where are you going?

34
00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.566
Our Su Ran

35
00:01:12.566 --> 00:01:14.866
You have to find a rich man like Mr. Ji

36
00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:16.433
Poor guy like you

37
00:01:16.766 --> 00:01:18.066
It's an eyesore to see

38
00:01:18.166 --> 00:01:19.900
Ruin my family's good deeds
