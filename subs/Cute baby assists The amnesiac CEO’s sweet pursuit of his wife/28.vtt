00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.566
What else does Mr. Ji order?

2
00:00:01.566 --> 00:00:02.966
It's not that I didn't eat enough ice cream

3
00:00:02.966 --> 00:00:04.466
Let me buy you another one.

4
00:00:04.733 --> 00:00:05.766
That

5
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:08.166
I want you to rejoin

6
00:00:08.166 --> 00:00:09.666
After all, the money is really spent.

7
00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:10.933
Well, thank you Mr. Ji

8
00:00:10.933 --> 00:00:12.700
I will make good use of this opportunity

9
00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:13.900
Work well.

10
00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:14.800
Thank you.

11
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:20.033
It turns out that I'm really not even as good as a child

12
00:00:22.933 --> 00:00:25.366
What about Su Ran? Su Ran and designer Sun

13
00:00:25.366 --> 00:00:27.333
Two people are having a meeting in the conference room next door

14
00:00:27.333 --> 00:00:29.566
What, just the two of them?

15
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:34.433
Su Ran won't make Mr. Ji angry again, right?

16
00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.433
It may be no wonder that he found Su Ran as soon as he came in.

17
00:00:37.566 --> 00:00:38.666
Go and see

18
00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.300
What happened to Mr. Ji?

19
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:45.900
I don't know.

20
00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.466
Do you want to eat together after lunch break?

21
00:00:50.966 --> 00:00:51.766
Ah!

22
00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:53.100
Hey

23
00:00:53.666 --> 00:00:54.966
Would you like a cup of coffee?

24
00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:56.633
Really no need to talk about it later

25
00:01:01.333 --> 00:01:02.633
Are you finished?

26
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:09.366
Can you later

27
00:01:09.366 --> 00:01:10.833
Don't be alone with your thoughts

28
00:01:10.966 --> 00:01:12.433
Mr. Ji shouldn't be

29
00:01:13.266 --> 00:01:14.466
Are you jealous?
