00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:01.000
What I mean is...

2
00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Don't have a meeting with Sun Jian alone

3
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.300
I am the leader of the project

4
00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:06.000
I have the right to know all the content of the meeting

5
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.266
You are the leader of this project

6
00:00:08.266 --> 00:00:09.366
I saw you were busy just now.

7
00:00:09.366 --> 00:00:11.000
Thinking about after the meeting with designer Sun

8
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.633
I will give you the meeting materials.

9
00:00:13.333 --> 00:00:14.733
I'm your boss.

10
00:00:14.733 --> 00:00:17.566
He's not you have to listen to me

11
00:00:17.566 --> 00:00:19.233
You are my boss he is not

12
00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:20.100
All right,all right, all right

13
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.166
I'll bring you to the next meeting, too.

14
00:00:22.733 --> 00:00:23.533
Hey

15
00:00:25.533 --> 00:00:28.166
Oh, I see.

16
00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.033
Yes, I bought this milk tea.

17
00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:35.366
Su Ran, no

18
00:00:35.366 --> 00:00:36.333
Su designer

19
00:00:36.333 --> 00:00:38.900
I have let you down before that.

20
00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:39.966
I apologize to you.

21
00:00:39.966 --> 00:00:42.766
At that time, if you encounter tens of thousands of projects, you will do it.

22
00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.066
Don't you forget to bring our colleagues?

23
00:00:45.133 --> 00:00:46.400
Haha, what do you say?

24
00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.966
It's just a cup of milk tea, and I want designer Su to take you.

25
00:00:48.966 --> 00:00:51.533
By the way, designer Su, you have been in the company for so long.

26
00:00:51.533 --> 00:00:52.933
I haven't had a bank meeting for you yet

27
00:00:52.933 --> 00:00:54.733
How about I treat you to make it up tonight?

28
00:00:54.733 --> 00:00:55.333
Second come

29
00:00:55.333 --> 00:00:57.700
It's also a celebration of your successful entry into the Early Warning Officer program

30
00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:58.333
What do you think?

31
00:00:58.333 --> 00:01:00.700
No, I already have a date tonight.

32
00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:01.500

33
00:01:01.766 --> 00:01:04.166
Oh, it's more important for you and Ji to date

34
00:01:04.166 --> 00:01:05.466
Then we'll make an appointment another day.

35
00:01:05.766 --> 00:01:06.966
That's not me.

36
00:01:06.966 --> 00:01:09.100
Designer Su, what you say is what you say.

37
00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.033
We all understand

38
00:01:11.133 --> 00:01:13.966
How about we have lunch together at noon? I'll treat you.

39
00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.600
Designer Su, you match Susan.

40
00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.700
You are a cockroach that can't be stepped on

41
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.366
Hello Aunt Su

42
00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:27.666
Do you still remember me?

43
00:01:27.666 --> 00:01:30.100
I am Guan Yingying, a good friend of Songran's university days

44
00:01:30.333 --> 00:01:32.666
I have something to tell you.
