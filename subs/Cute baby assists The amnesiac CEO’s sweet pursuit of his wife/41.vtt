00:00:03.466 --> 00:00:04.666
Where is this?

2
00:00:04.733 --> 00:00:05.633
My Bedroom

3
00:00:05.933 --> 00:00:06.966
Your bedroom.

4
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.900
We didn't have anything last night, did we?

5
00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:12.466
Do you want something to happen?

6
00:00:12.466 --> 00:00:13.766
I didn't mean that.

7
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.400
I'm afraid I've done something to make you angry again.

8
00:00:17.333 --> 00:00:18.300
Ah Su Ran

9
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.600
You don't really forget last night

10
00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:20.333
What did you say?

11
00:00:20.333 --> 00:00:21.566
I really don't know.

12
00:00:21.566 --> 00:00:23.500
If I knew, I would definitely apologize.

13
00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:24.700
Don't play dumb with me

14
00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:28.300
Young master, there is one outside

15
00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:29.933
The wife who claims to be Miss Su's mother

16
00:00:29.933 --> 00:00:31.433
Swing my mom

17
00:00:31.733 --> 00:00:32.900
How could he come?

18
00:00:33.066 --> 00:00:34.066
You still pretend to be me

19
00:00:34.066 --> 00:00:35.933
You didn't call it, who else could have called it?

20
00:00:35.933 --> 00:00:38.066
I really didn't. I didn't call him

21
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.466
Such a big family actually let me drink boiled water

22
00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.033
Mom what are you doing

23
00:00:45.166 --> 00:00:45.900
Sorry.

24
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:47.600
I apologize to you for my mother.

25
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:48.800
Sorry.

26
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.266
Daughter, how do you apologize to a servant?

27
00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.966
If you don't discipline him now

28
00:00:52.966 --> 00:00:55.500
When you marry, he will stand on your head

29
00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.100
Who said I want to marry your daughter?

30
00:00:58.266 --> 00:00:59.066
Mr. Ji

31
00:00:59.066 --> 00:01:02.700
If you don't say it, I know your friendship with Su Ran

32
00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.033
Then I am my friendship with Su Ran

33
00:01:05.333 --> 00:01:06.433
Who told you that?

34
00:01:07.066 --> 00:01:07.866
What you said

35
00:01:08.666 --> 00:01:10.966
I don't have my CEO Ji

36
00:01:11.266 --> 00:01:12.900
Can you keep Su Ran overnight?

37
00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.266
Doesn't that say it all?

38
00:01:14.266 --> 00:01:15.600
You are so confident

39
00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.166
Mr. Ji joked

40
00:01:17.166 --> 00:01:19.933
Well, wait until I find a good day for you, Mom.

41
00:01:19.933 --> 00:01:20.766
Don't say another word.

42
00:01:20.766 --> 00:01:21.866
Ji always has a fiancee

43
00:01:21.866 --> 00:01:22.700
Don't be delusional

44
00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:23.566
fiancee

45
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.700
Then aren't you a mistress?

46
00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:26.933
Oops Mr. Ji

47
00:01:26.933 --> 00:01:29.500
After all, my daughter has been with you too

48
00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.300
You don't express
