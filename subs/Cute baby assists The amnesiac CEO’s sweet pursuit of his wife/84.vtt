00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.433
How bad?

2
00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:02.733
Here's the thing.

3
00:00:02.733 --> 00:00:04.933
If you choose to have surgery to remove the clot

4
00:00:04.933 --> 00:00:06.666
There is a certain chance of memory loss

5
00:00:06.666 --> 00:00:07.800
And become a vegetable

6
00:00:07.966 --> 00:00:09.266
If conservative treatment is selected

7
00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:10.833
Waiting for the clot to be absorbed

8
00:00:10.966 --> 00:00:13.266
There is a danger of losing your life at any time

9
00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:14.266
So remember

10
00:00:14.366 --> 00:00:15.366
I suggest you

11
00:00:16.966 --> 00:00:18.900
OK, I see.

12
00:00:18.933 --> 00:00:20.900
Please help me with the hospitalization procedures first

13
00:00:20.966 --> 00:00:22.266
Yeah, all right.

14
00:00:22.966 --> 00:00:24.366
No need to look for a wedding planner

15
00:00:24.366 --> 00:00:26.866
But Mr. Ji still has my illness

16
00:00:26.866 --> 00:00:27.766
Help me keep it a secret

17
00:00:27.766 --> 00:00:28.566
Yes

18
00:00:29.066 --> 00:00:30.366
Hello, I'm going over now.

19
00:00:30.366 --> 00:00:32.066
You take MOMO in and wait for me.

20
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.133
The lady took the child and ordered two glasses of water

21
00:00:38.133 --> 00:00:39.366
Been sitting for 10 minutes

22
00:00:39.366 --> 00:00:40.866
We are a high-end restaurant

23
00:00:40.866 --> 00:00:41.900
Not a rest stop

24
00:00:42.166 --> 00:00:43.533
Excuse me, I'm waiting for someone.

25
00:00:43.533 --> 00:00:45.433
I'll order when someone arrives.

26
00:00:46.066 --> 00:00:47.200
This lady

27
00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.933
I think you can't afford to wear this dress.

28
00:00:49.933 --> 00:00:51.366
Please go out

29
00:00:52.133 --> 00:00:53.800
Who says we can't afford it?

30
00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.233
Handsome dad

31
00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.566
My son will directly laugh at my father in the future

32
00:01:03.933 --> 00:01:04.766
manager

33
00:01:04.766 --> 00:01:06.866
Is this how you teach your subordinates to treat my family?

34
00:01:07.533 --> 00:01:08.666
Eyeless thing

35
00:01:08.666 --> 00:01:11.300
Apologize to the top gifter
