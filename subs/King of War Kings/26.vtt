00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:01.000
Summer Dream

2
00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.600
This cleaner's dress really suits you

3
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.500
Xia Meng is waiting for you to be kicked out of the Xia Group

4
00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:08.500
Wouldn't it be nice to be a cleaner?

5
00:00:08.666 --> 00:00:12.466
Hey, Mr. Li, you forgot that late summer is blind

6
00:00:12.466 --> 00:00:14.066
Forget the janitors.

7
00:00:14.166 --> 00:00:16.533
I'm afraid it's not enough to go begging on the street

8
00:00:16.533 --> 00:00:18.000
Don't go too far

9
00:00:18.166 --> 00:00:19.066
Li Yangchen

10
00:00:19.266 --> 00:00:21.600
Even if you take the Xia Group from me

11
00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.266
With your ability, you will only bankrupt the group

12
00:00:24.466 --> 00:00:27.866
Hmph, I got Mr. Su's appreciation

13
00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:31.566
It is about to get tens of billions of orders for Xia Group

14
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.666
You say I'm incapable

15
00:00:33.666 --> 00:00:37.000
Are you doubting Mr. Su's vision?

16
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.333
Does Mr. Li have any business skills?

17
00:00:40.333 --> 00:00:42.200
I have my own means to tell

18
00:00:42.766 --> 00:00:47.166
It's not Miss Xia's turn to teach me how to do things.

19
00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.000
Mr. Li, I have been investing in the stock market recently.

20
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.200
Please help me take a look.

21
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.766
Which of these three stocks should I choose?

22
00:00:57.133 --> 00:01:01.300
Mr. Su, I suggest you buy a Denning battery.

23
00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.000
Why have electric vehicles become a trend these days?

24
00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.033
Denning is a leading enterprise in lithium batteries

25
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.000
The future is inevitable

26
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.533
The other two stocks

27
00:01:11.533 --> 00:01:13.100
One is traditional manufacturing

28
00:01:13.133 --> 00:01:14.966
One is the cosmetics industry.

29
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.100
I'm not too optimistic about these two.

30
00:01:20.766 --> 00:01:23.300
Give me 1 billion to buy the stock of Dening battery

31
00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:24.433
Yes

32
00:01:27.766 --> 00:01:28.566
Mr. Su

33
00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.200
Congratulations to Mr. Su

34
00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:31.366
Just now

35
00:01:31.466 --> 00:01:34.100
The battery has risen by 30 points

36
00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.300
Hmm haha

37
00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.933
Did you see Xia Meng?

38
00:01:38.933 --> 00:01:41.233
This is my business talent

39
00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:42.900
Hahahaha
