00:00:00.766 --> 00:00:03.100
Dr. Fu, may you have misdiagnosed?

2
00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:04.400
How could I have misdiagnosed?

3
00:00:04.533 --> 00:00:07.000
I just shone a flashlight in your eye

4
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.600
Pupils have a noticeable constriction response

5
00:00:08.666 --> 00:00:10.000
It's human instinct

6
00:00:10.266 --> 00:00:12.566
It means your eyes are sensitive to light.

7
00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:14.800
In other words

8
00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:16.400
You don't have insomnia at all

9
00:00:16.666 --> 00:00:18.066
Do you mean to say

10
00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:19.500
My eyes moved.

11
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:20.600
Did you read it wrong?

12
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:23.900
It's pointless to pay the doctor to pretend again

13
00:00:24.066 --> 00:00:26.400
Doctor Fu, believe it or not

14
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.166
I was truly blind.

15
00:00:28.166 --> 00:00:29.466
At the age of 12

16
00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.266
My parents drove me out to play

17
00:00:31.266 --> 00:00:32.866
And there was a car accident.

18
00:00:33.066 --> 00:00:34.666
They died in a car accident.

19
00:00:34.666 --> 00:00:36.833
And I got away with it.

20
00:00:36.866 --> 00:00:38.300
Optic nerve damage

21
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:38.800
Became blind

22
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.900
So how did you cure your eyes?

23
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.066
A while ago, an expert helped me cure it.

24
00:00:43.066 --> 00:00:44.733
Now that your eyes have been cured

25
00:00:44.733 --> 00:00:46.800
Why continue to pretend to be blind?

26
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.200
Doctor Fu, do you believe me?

27
00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.566
Of course, after my eyes recovered

28
00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.400
I wanted to share this good news as soon as possible

29
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:53.566
Share with my husband

30
00:00:53.566 --> 00:00:56.266
As a result, he accidentally ran into the nanny of his cheating family

31
00:00:56.266 --> 00:00:57.500
Also seek to hurt

32
00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:58.900
In order not to be hurt by them

33
00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:00.666
I can only continue to pretend to be a little lady

34
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.900
Why would you marry someone like that?

35
00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:05.600
Because he is nice to me.

36
00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:07.233
That's good.

37
00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.100
It's like exquisite candy on countless armors

38
00:01:10.733 --> 00:01:12.166
Sweet and tender

39
00:01:13.266 --> 00:01:15.000
And I was blinded

40
00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.600
Fell into a trap carefully designed by Li Yangcheng
