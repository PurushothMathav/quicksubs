00:00:00.533 --> 00:00:02.366
You... you're not falling asleep?

2
00:00:02.366 --> 00:00:04.233
This is reincarnation.

3
00:00:04.533 --> 00:00:06.633
That old fairy really exists

4
00:00:06.933 --> 00:00:08.566
Send me 49 games

5
00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:11.166
Means I can reincarnate 49 times

6
00:00:12.066 --> 00:00:14.033
Honey, are you alright?

7
00:00:14.366 --> 00:00:16.066
I can't let them know about my situation

8
00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.166
I have to keep loading

9
00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.000
Ah, I'm fine.

10
00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:23.366
I just woke up to see you

11
00:00:30.966 --> 00:00:32.066
Hey husband

12
00:00:32.333 --> 00:00:34.666
Is there anyone else in this room besides you?

13
00:00:34.666 --> 00:00:35.566
You heard wrong.

14
00:00:35.566 --> 00:00:36.300
No one else

15
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.266
Not really. No, actually.

16
00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:51.800
Madam your tea

17
00:00:53.933 --> 00:00:56.100
By the way, how is Butler Chen's injury?

18
00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.900
No life-threatening for now

19
00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:00.000
But there seems to be something wrong with my brain

20
00:01:00.766 --> 00:01:02.700
Butler Chen is really unlucky

21
00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:03.966
Walking and falling

22
00:01:03.966 --> 00:01:05.866
I hit my head against the wall

23
00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:07.700
I guess it's old

24
00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.600
Let's go and see him tomorrow.

25
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.100
Uh, Butler Chen needs admiration

26
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.866
Let's leave him alone

27
00:01:13.866 --> 00:01:16.000
Besides, he's just a servant

28
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.033
Don't bother so much, ma'am

29
00:01:18.366 --> 00:01:21.033
Kim Mi-ki, are you teaching me how to do things?
