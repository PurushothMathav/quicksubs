00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.600
In the eyes of this child, he has no father since he was a child

2
00:00:17.266 --> 00:00:20.400
I'm busy with company affairs all day

3
00:00:20.566 --> 00:00:22.833
Lack of care for him

4
00:00:23.466 --> 00:00:25.266
I knew this earlier

5
00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.166
I should spend more time with him

6
00:00:28.966 --> 00:00:31.700
Mom, you blame me

7
00:00:32.766 --> 00:00:34.966
That foreign car was coming for me

8
00:00:35.333 --> 00:00:37.700
If I hadn't become the daughter-in-law of the world

9
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.033
The eyes will not die

10
00:00:40.766 --> 00:00:42.600
Maybe someone else is right

11
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.266
I was born a broom star

12
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.000
It's not your fault.

13
00:00:48.466 --> 00:00:50.266
You don't have to blame yourself.

14
00:00:51.166 --> 00:00:52.633
Maybe.

15
00:00:53.466 --> 00:00:56.566
This is the life of our mother

16
00:00:56.966 --> 00:00:57.900
Mom

17
00:00:58.466 --> 00:01:00.466
We can only accept our fate

18
00:01:01.666 --> 00:01:03.766
Fate is destined by God

19
00:01:04.333 --> 00:01:06.066
We can only accept

20
00:01:06.066 --> 00:01:07.566
Can't be changed

21
00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:10.900
I'm going out

22
00:01:24.966 --> 00:01:26.166
After I Died

23
00:01:26.533 --> 00:01:28.600
What if it can be reincarnated again?

24
00:01:28.933 --> 00:01:30.100
In that case

25
00:01:30.366 --> 00:01:31.566
There is salvation in the eyes

26
00:01:31.566 --> 00:01:35.066
The old man advises you not to do stupid things

27
00:01:35.866 --> 00:01:36.900
Old fairy

28
00:01:38.066 --> 00:01:42.300
Nina's seventy-seven forty-nine big dreams are over

29
00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.500
Your destiny is sealed

30
00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.900
If you die this time

31
00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.600
I'll never wake up again
