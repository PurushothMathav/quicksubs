1
00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:05.233
So you married me to deal with the family

2
00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:10.366
Why did Mr. Fu choose me?

3
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:11.866
The woman chasing after you

4
00:00:11.866 --> 00:00:12.766
As long as you speak

5
00:00:12.766 --> 00:00:14.100
I'm sure they'd love to.

6
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:15.466
Choose your reason

7
00:00:16.266 --> 00:00:17.633
It's not convenient for me to say

8
00:00:18.333 --> 00:00:19.733
Since Mr. Fu is inconvenient to say

9
00:00:19.733 --> 00:00:21.066
Then I'll listen to you.

10
00:00:21.066 --> 00:00:22.533
The reason why you chose me

11
00:00:22.533 --> 00:00:23.800
It's because I was divorced

12
00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.000
In your eyes

13
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.566
The woman who lost her first marriage

14
00:00:26.566 --> 00:00:28.766
It's easier to agree to your request, right?

15
00:00:32.466 --> 00:00:34.700
Miss Xia, you are very smart.

16
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.800
But this time you're wrong.

17
00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:37.766
I'll tell you

18
00:00:37.766 --> 00:00:39.066
If you have to be in this world

19
00:00:39.066 --> 00:00:40.466
Choose someone to marry

20
00:00:40.466 --> 00:00:42.933
Then I will definitely choose someone like Miss Xia

21
00:00:42.933 --> 00:00:44.266
Because of the fake marriage with you

22
00:00:44.266 --> 00:00:45.666
I will not be disgusted.

23
00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:49.066
Is Mr. Fu really a straight man of steel?

24
00:00:49.066 --> 00:00:50.500
I see you are very good at flirting

25
00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:57.900
Then marry Mr. Fu

26
00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.000
What's in it for me?

27
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.600
You give up your shares for 200 million

28
00:01:01.966 --> 00:01:03.300
Fengcheng is already known to everyone

29
00:01:03.566 --> 00:01:04.666
Give you money

30
00:01:04.666 --> 00:01:06.333
The man who has bad intentions towards you

31
00:01:06.333 --> 00:01:07.600
As many as you want

32
00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:08.700
If you marry me

33
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.666
I can not only be your shield

34
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.166
I can protect you.

35
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:13.433
After all

36
00:01:14.266 --> 00:01:16.866
I'm not going to give you that $200 million.

37
00:01:17.133 --> 00:01:18.800
Again, Mr. Fu

38
00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:19.966
Stop talking

39
00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.300
Let's get married, then.
