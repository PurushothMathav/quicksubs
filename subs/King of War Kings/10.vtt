00:00:06.933 --> 00:00:09.366
Sorry for not being rescued.

2
00:00:09.533 --> 00:00:12.166
Oh, honey!

3
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.800
How can I live without you?

4
00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:17.200
old lady

5
00:00:18.133 --> 00:00:19.466
You are the patient here.

6
00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.166
Acquired cancer

7
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.033
Do chemotherapy here

8
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.533
My wife lent me money everywhere to treat diseases

9
00:00:27.533 --> 00:00:30.033
Ask for help at a low level

10
00:00:30.166 --> 00:00:31.766
I advised him to give up

11
00:00:31.766 --> 00:00:37.400
But he didn't want to let me go, I didn't expect him to leave like this

12
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.766
Lord Slag, let me help you back to the house first

13
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:41.800
Hahahaha

14
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:50.466
This guy

15
00:00:50.466 --> 00:00:53.566
It's really unlucky to stuff my teeth with a sip of cold water

16
00:00:53.933 --> 00:00:54.733
madam

17
00:00:55.166 --> 00:00:58.000
Do you think that person will be unable to think about it when he goes back?

18
00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.700
Suicide

19
00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:00.066
Shut your crow's mouth

20
00:01:01.166 --> 00:01:03.400
It's not good to pay the doctor. Pay the doctor.

21
00:01:03.966 --> 00:01:06.233
The patient just now, he jumped off the building

22
00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:07.600
Pardon me?

23
00:01:08.733 --> 00:01:09.866
There is still a chance

24
00:01:10.266 --> 00:01:11.466
I can save him.

25
00:01:11.666 --> 00:01:14.700
The wife is gone, how can you save her like this?

26
00:01:15.733 --> 00:01:17.900
Miss Xia, please go back first

27
00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:19.166
Leave it to me here

28
00:01:19.166 --> 00:01:20.200
Wait a minute.

29
00:01:20.933 --> 00:01:21.866
Dr. Fu

30
00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:23.700
Only I can save him
