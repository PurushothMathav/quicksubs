00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:05.720
Ma'am, I'm going to fire him.

2
00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:06.620
So as not to get dirty.

3
00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:10.580
Ah.

4
00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:12.580
Excuse me.

5
00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:15.700
I didn't know it was the last time.

6
00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:17.060
If you want to blame your father.

7
00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:20.580
Don't blame Chau Du Nuong and Tuan Tuan

8
00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.740
I didn t mention those two girls in front of my daughter.

9
00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:30.360
I know you and I

10
00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:32.140
I just want to visit An An.

11
00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.660
See An An basically does not know An An An is allergic to sweets.

12
00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:39.780
You don't know.

13
00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:42.620
Can't even grapes be eaten?

14
00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.060
How do you know?

15
00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.700
I was busy with my mother at the time.

16
00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:52.620
I'll send someone to find you.

17
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.200
Remember what you said?

18
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.100
He told me to find another doctor.

19
00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:59.220
Deputy Hoai An

20
00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.620
Ann was always the one you ignored.

21
00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.100
So now it's a little pretense.

22
00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:09.820
Safe.

23
00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:13.340
Mom came to visit you.

24
00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.420
I brought you your favorite cheese.

25
00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:23.980
Come see me in my dreams

26
00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:25.900
Okay?

27
00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:27.780
Excuse me.

28
00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.840
These are the things the Army chooses, the things he likes to eat.

29
00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.260
I thought children.

30
00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.780
They will all like Pho Hoai An.

31
00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:39.060
You can remember all the Army's favorites.

32
00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.340
But even an allergy doesn't know.

33
00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.660
He is not fit to be the father of An An.

34
00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.060
Honey, don't come with me, okay?

35
00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.220
Can you let me stay a little longer?

36
00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:53.700
No need.

37
00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.780
You go see the Army.

38
00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:01.720
Sister, I'm sorry.

39
00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.220
It's all my brother's fault.

40
00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.900
If you really feel sorry...

41
00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:07.780
Disappear now.

42
00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:10.700
Don't show up in front of him anymore.

43
00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:13.680
Tuan Hien

44
00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:16.820
Why are you here?

45
00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.040
Don't leave me young.

46
00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.840
I'm young and dying.

47
00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.300
What's wrong with your mother?

48
00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.700
I told them to go back to the sea immediately.

49
00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.740
Miss, is this girl too much?

50
00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.660
These two girls don't know what the hell they're doing.

51
00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:37.880
Don't call me later.

52
00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.780
I'll be reasonable with him right away.

53
00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.740
Spring Dao packing furniture

54
00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:44.540
Let's take a look.
