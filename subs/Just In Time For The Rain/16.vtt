00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:01.400
What are you doing?

2
00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:04.760
Blind? To avenge our daughter.

3
00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:05.620
Deputy Lord

4
00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:07.640
This is between women.

5
00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:09.720
This person who does wrong must be punished.

6
00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:12.220
Did you say that's why?

7
00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:15.460
Help me, Child.

8
00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:18.240
You hate me, you can punish me whatever you want.

9
00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.280
But can you please don't be mad at Ran? I told you.

10
00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:22.760
An s death had nothing to do with them.

11
00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:24.120
They're innocent.

12
00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:24.940
Hoai An

13
00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.860
Anyone can tell me.

14
00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:31.260
I want them not to.

15
00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.300
Not if you do that again.

16
00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:36.440
I'll report to the government.

17
00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:37.620
Let the government handle it.

18
00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:38.780
The government came back.

19
00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:41.060
Not invited in is a thief.

20
00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:43.040
I want to fight and go to jail.

21
00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:44.120
What's not invited in?

22
00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:44.840
This is a rich man.

23
00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.460
It's my house. I told him to come to your house.

24
00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:49.680
Are you home?

25
00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.460
This yard is a dowry my brother bought for me when we got married.

26
00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.240
Vice Hoai An, you eat too much soft rice, you eat your mind.

27
00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:58.040
Gu Ky Dao

28
00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.340
Why are you so serious?

29
00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.700
You killed my daughter.

30
00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:06.180
Removing my daughter's legacy.

31
00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.220
Piano disinfection

32
00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:10.940
Now tell me my name.

33
00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:13.140
You're really good at reversing black and white.

34
00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:14.820
You have edited An An's furniture.

35
00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.660
Didn't I tell you not to get emotional 2 and An An's stuff?

36
00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:19.880
I will.

37
00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.200
The army said he was afraid.

38
00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.920
I'm also afraid you see those things sad.

39
00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.220
That's why they threw it away.

40
00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.980
Sorry, you blame me.

41
00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:32.300
We don't blame you.

42
00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:34.140
But you should have told me first.

43
00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:36.820
What a wolf.

44
00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.080
Break into people's homes to destroy furniture

45
00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:42.840
I want to see if you're scared to get into the building.

46
00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:43.940
I'm not going to jail.

47
00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.500
Ah Hoan, hurry up and save the film crew.

48
00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.700
This mansion is really the supporting role of Thanh Nhi.

49
00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:51.860
I have no right to replace him.

50
00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.400
God, save me.

51
00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:58.020
You just let me go, I'll do whatever I want.

52
00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:01.780
Then you go find An An's stuff for me.

53
00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.360
You remember none.

54
00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:06.980
Otherwise, you know the consequences.

55
00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:07.840
Child.

56
00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:10.420
Ran Ran bad health or where am I going?

57
00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:13.080
Go.

58
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.420
Let him go to jail.

59
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.500
No, no, I'll find it.

60
00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:22.060
You'd better get An An's stuff back.

61
00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.660
Otherwise I will tell you what it means to live without death.
