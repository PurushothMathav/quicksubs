00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:02.020
My daughter is dead.

2
00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:05.860
When you die, your whole body and blood flow.

3
00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:07.900
My doctor.

4
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:12.260
He was busy saving White Moon's daughter.

5
00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:14.980
Deputy Hoai An Chu Nhien

6
00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.020
I want you to pay your blood debt.

7
00:00:22.833 --> 00:00:24.633
5 days ago

8
00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:30.580
How's he doing?

9
00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:34.460
An An is just emotional intelligence

10
00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:35.740
You're welcome.

11
00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.740
Then they live at the foot of the mountain, I'm afraid they're in danger, I have to go back and see what you say?

12
00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.260
Grandfather.

13
00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.820
I come back, you come back for me.

14
00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:57.820
The army is fine.

15
00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:59.060
He was only slightly injured.

16
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.340
An An was also injured, I have to go back immediately.

17
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.380
Yang, what's wrong with you?

18
00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.520
Mom, there's a lot of blood on your arm.

19
00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.340
Uncle, you've got to save my mother!

20
00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:18.900
What are you talking about?

21
00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.100
Hoai An, I'm fine.

22
00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:27.000
Hoai An

23
00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.220
I'm useless.

24
00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:30.920
You don't have to care about us.

25
00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:32.520
Would you like to see An An?

26
00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.220
But what are you talking about?

27
00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.380
How can I not care about you?

28
00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.180
An was only slightly injured.

29
00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:40.260
Sunny can take care of her.

30
00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.980
I'll get you to the hospital first.

31
00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.520
Waiting for grandpa.

32
00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.140
Grandfather will come back to visit you.

33
00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.940
Why didn't my grandfather come to save me?

34
00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:56.820
Don't you need me anymore?

35
00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:00.380
Why don't you need me?

36
00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:09.580
An An wants to sleep, An An.

37
00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:17.280
Help me!

38
00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.700
Help me! Help me!

39
00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.340
Help me!

40
00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:28.360
Has anyone come to save my child?

41
00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:29.980
Has anyone come to save my child?
