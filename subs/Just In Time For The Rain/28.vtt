1
00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:01.200
Intentionally.

2
00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:03.520
I fell into this situation.

3
00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:05.380
Are you proud?

4
00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:07.980
I'm here today.

5
00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:09.580
Just came to see you laugh.

6
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.880
If you don't kill me

7
00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:15.060
How could I end up like this?

8
00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.300
You don't want an assistant anymore.

9
00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.180
I don't want to be nice to me.

10
00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:22.020
I became like this.

11
00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.620
It's all because of you.

12
00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:25.220
I killed.

13
00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:28.440
You really don't change.

14
00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:31.900
I will not cut you down, it is already my kindness to feed the dogs.

15
00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.020
How about I bail you out?

16
00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.220
I want to kiss you.

17
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.600
Tell me, what do you want me to do?

18
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.940
My heart is naturally very good.

19
00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:46.620
You fell in this field today

20
00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.980
I have a great relationship with Vice.

21
00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.020
Don t you want to seek revenge?

22
00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.300
I'd love to see you bite dogs.

23
00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.180
All the pain I've been through

24
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.520
It's all because of you.

25
00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.060
You're not afraid.

26
00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:12.480
seeking your revenge.

27
00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:14.580
If you think you can

28
00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:17.580
Place an order at any time

29
00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:20.860
The tourists are here.

30
00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:24.140
There will be a second guest soon.

31
00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.340
I'm not here to be a guest.

32
00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:29.780
Come with me.

33
00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.100
Why are you here?

34
00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.300
If I don't come again

35
00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.540
Do you want to exchange it?

36
00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.680
Do you know he's here?

37
00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:40.160
If not, what happened to him?

38
00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:41.280
Send it to the brothel.

39
00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.260
Child, I told you.

40
00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:44.920
Anyone who hurts you

41
00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.560
I'll make him pay.

42
00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.700
Something unapologetic like this.

43
00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.100
Let him stay here and learn to accept his fate.

44
00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:54.560
Strong

45
00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.120
Don't you want to take me out?

46
00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:58.740
I've changed my mind.

47
00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.040
You're right.

48
00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.980
People like you should be here.

49
00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.080
Learn to accept fate.

50
00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.640
Remember, no matter how much you hate me

51
00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:09.820
I'm begging you.

52
00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.500
I'm begging you to say something.

53
00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:17.620
If you have time, can you help me to see the Army?

54
00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.760
Just say it.

55
00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.540
I miss him.
