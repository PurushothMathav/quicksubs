1
00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:04.780
An An, who killed you.

2
00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:06.980
Come to modify for you.

3
00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:09.040
Accidentally.

4
00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:11.980
What are you doing? What are you doing?

5
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:13.660
What are you doing down?

6
00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:16.740
My head, sir.

7
00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:18.240
I advise you to think clearly.

8
00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.580
Do you want to let your child breathe?

9
00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:22.920
Or do you want to put him back in prison?

10
00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.380
Won't you put your head down?

11
00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:26.540
Then I'll teach you.

12
00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.140
First.

13
00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.820
You stole my husband.

14
00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:33.020
Broke up my family.

15
00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:37.180
The second time is to pay my daughter.

16
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.220
Clearly, he's lost too much blood.

17
00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.320
Also called Vice Hoai An.

18
00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.700
The third time is to compensate me.

19
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.140
Robbed my husband.

20
00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:48.980
Kill my son.

21
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:50.980
Not knowing how to repent

22
00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:52.320
Lu Thanh

23
00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.860
I know you're angry, but you can't throw a sword at an innocent person.

24
00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:57.400
If the body is weak

25
00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:58.200
If he is eternal.

26
00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:59.820
Then let him die.

27
00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.300
Fits one network to one network.

28
00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.820
Young Child, how did you first see this unbearable thing?

29
00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:10.180
You're blind.

30
00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.920
Gu Thanh, you treat me like that.

31
00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:14.780
Aren't you afraid of retribution?

32
00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:17.240
Shut up.

33
00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:20.260
The Lord s name is what you can call it.

34
00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:23.480
As for you, it is best to return the money to me quickly.

35
00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:24.280
In addition

36
00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:26.980
Say more things I don't like to hear.

37
00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:28.820
I'll keep hitting him.

38
00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.720
Mom, you're finally helping me vent.

39
00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.500
Are you happy?

40
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.460
More than that.
