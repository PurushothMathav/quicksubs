00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.560
Other cake points recognize good cake points

2
00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:12.420
Then take off.

3
00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:14.440
You be careful.

4
00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:16.840
Don't make An An fall, rest assured.

5
00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:18.460
It's me, isn't it?

6
00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:23.340
Does Princess Hoai An really want to kill us all?

7
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.000
Now I don't have a job to make money.

8
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.380
There's no place to stay.

9
00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.240
What did you say I should do later?

10
00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.600
Sunny is angry now.

11
00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:32.980
Wait for him to think of it.

12
00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.140
Canceling it won't make it difficult for you.

13
00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.520
Just stay here.

14
00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.380
It's not a good drum anyway.

15
00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:47.340
If he lets his sister know for sure that he'll mess with you again, he's already at his mother's house.

16
00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.100
Will you be back in a while?

17
00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:50.940
Waiting for me to find you a house.

18
00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:52.780
You can move it.

19
00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.180
Okay, thanks.

20
00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:57.560
Without you

21
00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:59.580
I really don't know what to do.

22
00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.160
When we first got married, we

23
00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.340
I definitely won't make as much noise as my sister.

24
00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.580
Suddenly we're over.

25
00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.580
I love Sunny now.

26
00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.020
I wouldn't do anything to betray her.

27
00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:26.340
Run to my mother's house, why don't you come and save me today?

28
00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.120
Not going to save you every day.

29
00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:29.420
I'm here to save you.

30
00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.560
You hide.

31
00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:32.360
Mom.

32
00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:33.400
Hi.

33
00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:37.100
Oh, the star.

34
00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.820
What's wrong? Blindfolded again?

35
00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.680
Dear, I dreamed that it was dark, I dreamed that his whole body was covered in blood.

36
00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.780
Or beg me to beg him, you say it.

37
00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:53.620
Are you blaming me?

38
00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.860
God, we shouldn't have brought him to God.

39
00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:58.940
Stop thinking that.

40
00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:00.500
Now you're like this.

41
00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.500
Your brother is really worried about you.

42
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.503
I'll attach a peace suit and remain there for a bit.
