00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:08.940
Nails to the ribs

2
00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:10.220
Too much blood loss.

3
00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:11.860
Excuse me, ma'am.

4
00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:18.820
Tell me what the festival is.

5
00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.780
My child is so obedient.

6
00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.420
He just talked to me.

7
00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:26.620
I heard you.

8
00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:30.420
How could he die?

9
00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:31.680
The doctor.

10
00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:33.980
My husband told me.

11
00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:35.460
Tell him he's only slightly injured.

12
00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.000
Did you look at it wrong?

13
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.220
Take a look again.

14
00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:44.960
The doctor.

15
00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.860
The doctor.

16
00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.000
Help him.

17
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.520
The baby's blood is dry.

18
00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:58.800
Excuse me, ma'am.

19
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.660
The old man couldn't do anything.

20
00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:06.260
It's impossible.

21
00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.440
It's impossible.

22
00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.700
Why did you leave me?

23
00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:14.500
Safe.

24
00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:16.060
Safe.

25
00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:22.580
This baby.

26
00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:24.540
It scared the hell out of me.

27
00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:32.200
The military is not very good.

28
00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.000
That's right.

29
00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.140
Take this money.

30
00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.220
Buy him some food, let him replenish his health.

31
00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:47.080
You gave me so much money.

32
00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:49.880
Does God blame you?

33
00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:50.980
No.

34
00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:52.640
My son is the lord.

35
00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:53.680
Her family is well off.

36
00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.480
Being human is the nicest.

37
00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:57.160
She won't care.

38
00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:02.560
I don't know how to thank you, I'm a daughter of God, you and I are mortal sinners.

39
00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.020
Once discovered.

40
00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.020
Of course not.

41
00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.580
I have told the outside that you are my compatriot.

42
00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.200
Even the child does not know your true identity.

43
00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:17.080


44
00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:18.360
Where are you going?

45
00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:19.640
I'm a little worried about An An.

46
00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:20.900
I'll come back and have a look first.

47
00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:23.960
You saved me!

48
00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:27.540
I'm afraid he'll leave me.

49
00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:31.940
Don't be afraid.

50
00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:33.620
I'm not going.

51
00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.740
You're still there.

52
00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:44.660
"You still can't find me, let's just take your body home."

53
00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.060
This child was terrified during his days of hiding.

54
00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:53.500
It's always a nightmare now.

55
00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:55.620


56
00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.560
Thank you, without you

57
00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.780
I don't know what my mother and daughter will do.

58
00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:07.620
Hoai An

59
00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:13.980
Hug enough?
