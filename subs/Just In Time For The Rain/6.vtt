00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:02.540
Wow, help me!

2
00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:03.440
What are you doing?

3
00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:06.340
Tell them to let Ran go, don't you think?

4
00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:09.740
Take Zhuren, the daughter of the emperor.

5
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.940
You didn't just kill An An.

6
00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.000
Do you want to hurt our entire family?

7
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.440
Sunny, you're mad at me, you mess with me, I can solve it.

8
00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:21.100
But you can't let the soldiers capture him for the sake of life, you're killing him.

9
00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:24.860
I see that you're not just unclear

10
00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.820
Even the mind is not easy to carry.

11
00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:30.300
I want to die. I don't want to.

12
00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:33.560
Death

13
00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.060
Are you sure you want to chase?

14
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.980
An An is still waiting to be buried.

15
00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.960
Seven.

16
00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.360
I'm sure they're okay.

17
00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:44.860
You let An An come back.

18
00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:46.820
When I get home, bring my own grass.

19
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:48.420
You're waiting for me.

20
00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:50.020
I'm home.

21
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:52.220
There's no alcohol.

22
00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:55.660
Put it together, kid.

23
00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.460
Do not kill soldiers.

24
00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:01.040
Murder!

25
00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.960
Get me out of here.

26
00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:07.360
I don't want rats in prison.

27
00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:12.100
Uncle Bunny, help us out quickly, the Army is afraid, the Army is not afraid.

28
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.160
Ran, I've been looking for half a day.

29
00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:15.860
You will soon.

30
00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.380
Really thank you, I want to

31
00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.760
Is it going to be buried?

32
00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:30.720
Come back.

33
00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.760
Don't be late, see him one last time.

34
00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:33.660
It's okay.

35
00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:35.920
I told the kids.

36
00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:37.260
Wait until I get back and then bury it.

37
00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:39.260
I'll see him one last time.

38
00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:40.680
Let's go.

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:55.440
