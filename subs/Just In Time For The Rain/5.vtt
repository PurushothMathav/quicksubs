00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.020
Mom.

2
00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:07.740
You are the strongest.

3
00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:12.500
Do you look like him?

4
00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:19.540
I said I wanted to be with my mother for the rest of my life.

5
00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:23.300
If there is a next life

6
00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:27.740
She's still my daughter.

7
00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:30.900
Okay.

8
00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:38.560
The baby is about to be buried.

9
00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:40.140
Why hasn't the payment arrived yet?

10
00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.320
I heard that you paid a couple more, and this is already out of the question.

11
00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.120
Animals

12
00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:46.160
My daughter's funeral didn't come.

13
00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:47.560
That's outrageous.

14
00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:51.860
Child, I will immediately find someone to arrest him, by the way, deal with that kind of dancer.

15
00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:54.260
Coming?

16
00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.400
Is the Vice President back yet?

17
00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:02.440
You can't come back a little late.

18
00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.160
And you let me check this out.

19
00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.040
She is the most suitable woman for Chu Binh An.

20
00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:08.500
That year the Zhou family's wife was all from the people onwards.

21
00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:09.800
My uncle saved him.

22
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.900
Now hide in the small town of Sung Chau to hide the daughter of the criminal.

23
00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:15.840
This is the great crime of the Zhujiu tribe.

24
00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.460
If you know.

25
00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:19.780
Does he want to kill our entire family?

26
00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.780
Why arrest criminals?

27
00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:32.140
I want Fo Huai An and Chu Nhien to die peacefully.

28
00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:34.660
Right.

29
00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.240
What's going on? What's going on?

30
00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:39.940
Are you blaming me?

31
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.840
If it wasn't for me and the Army...

32
00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:43.940
Maybe you can save him.

33
00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:45.820
What does it have to do with you?

34
00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.460
It's all my fault.

35
00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.460
The army is done.

36
00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:53.020
You can give him the medicine later.

37
00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:54.380
I'll be back first.

38
00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.840
Okay, you go back, don't be late, go to An An's funeral.

39
00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.840
No, I don't want you to leave.

40
00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.080
I want my uncle to give me medicine.

41
00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.040
Oh, son.

42
00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.620
The deputy had to go to see An An for the last time.

43
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.520
The liar must have cheated on you.

44
00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.480
Surely it is, no way.

45
00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.740
If you don't ask me, I don't drink.

46
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.800
It's okay.

47
00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.140
I'll come in, finish my meds and go home.

48
00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.500
You're welcome.

49
00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.120
Deputy Hoai An Chu Nhien

50
00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.340
I want you to give your life to An An.
