00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:03.900
Jen, your brother told me all about you.

2
00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:07.540
I've investigated.

3
00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:10.340
When I was a child, I admired Zhu Nhien.

4
00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:11.960
Zhu Bingan does not value him

5
00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:13.800
The Zhou family was later convicted.

6
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:15.900
Vice Hoan An could not bear the white moon

7
00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.780
The lion hid.

8
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.180
It's not just that.

9
00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.220
The house that Zhuren currently lives in was also purchased by Vice-Hoan for him.

10
00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.140
With his current experience.

11
00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:27.120
But you can't do such a big thing.

12
00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:28.900
How much can experience cost?

13
00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.020
Then I have to pretend that.

14
00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:35.780
Deputy Security, he's very sorry.

15
00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.340
The shopkeeper is here.

16
00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:46.680
What are you singing?

17
00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:47.800
I know it's a restaurant.

18
00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.420
I don't know. I thought it was a theater.

19
00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.440
What does the lady say?

20
00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.660
I don't like to listen.

21
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.620
I'll change your personal skills for you.

22
00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:02.020
The little girl didn't seem guilty of the girl.

23
00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.860
Why is she making trouble for me as soon as she gets up here?

24
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.220
That's your little girl.

25
00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.760
This little girl sings beautifully.

26
00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.240
How can you make it difficult for him?

27
00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:17.500
Hey, you didn't know this fox was the sexiest.

28
00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.940
This is especially true for married men.

29
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.520
Born low.

30
00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.720
How do you know he's attracted to a married man?

31
00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.940
Because he seduced my husband.

32
00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.420
It's based on something beautiful.

33
00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.220
Telling the general not to come home every day

34
00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.540
You two even conspired to kill my daughter.

35
00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:40.980
What's going on?

36
00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.080
I'm not. I'm not.

37
00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:44.340
You have nothing.

38
00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:46.900
You don't seduce others.

39
00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.300
Still didn't kill someone else's daughter.

40
00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.840
Bought the house with my dowry.

41
00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.240
Is it comfortable to stay?

42
00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.280
This type of woman is the most disgusting.

43
00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.840
It's unfortunate to think of speaking for him.

44
00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.480
Look, he lives like a mannequin.

45
00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:05.260
He was the one who was crying to death.

46
00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:13.560
The shopkeeper's such an unlucky toy to keep him singing, aren't you afraid to close the door?

47
00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:14.360
old man

48
00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.420
You're really too much.
