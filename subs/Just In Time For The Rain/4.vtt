1
00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:05.980
Come in and show you the lanterns.

2
00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:08.780
Look at these lanterns.

3
00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.520
An An's birthday is in a few days.

4
00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.860
Can my brother stay with me?

5
00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.180
Isn't it good for you to come with me?

6
00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:25.480
My brother hasn't come home in a long time.

7
00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.200
I miss him so much.

8
00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.580
Is your brother a real fan?

9
00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:32.220
I really want to be his daughter.

10
00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:33.700
Why is that?

11
00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:35.980
My favorite is An An.

12
00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.560
A few days ago he asked you what you like.

13
00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:40.300
I want to bring you a gift.

14
00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.760
Really? An An doesn't need gifts.

15
00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:47.440
An An wanted my father and mother to watch the flower lanterns with me.

16
00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:49.260
Want a rabbit flower lamp

17
00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.220
Then let me buy it for you.

18
00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.440
You cry so ugly.

19
00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.680
No wonder my uncle doesn't want to go back.

20
00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.040
In fact, that day I saw you all bleed a lot.

21
00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:10.540
What is he?

22
00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:13.420
Juanjuan many people like that.

23
00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:14.740
Running what?

24
00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.040
Sister.

25
00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:20.660
Sister.

26
00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.060
Child, why are you here?

27
00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.320
Did you bring An An to play?

28
00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.640
Where is An An?

29
00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.200
Why did you take her out with the Army?

30
00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.260
We don't have an unscrupulous sister like you.

31
00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.880
Child.

32
00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:41.900
The Khang army initially recovered from serious illness.

33
00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:43.700
He wants me to take him out.

34
00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:46.140
You didn't know his father died early.

35
00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:47.460
Don't let the nanny see your face.

36
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.220
Isn't it the right time, these two days are the lantern festival?

37
00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.020
I took him out to play.

38
00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.020
Anna's dead.

39
00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:56.580
It's dead.

40
00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:58.600
Guo Khai, are you finally done?

41
00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.280
I've checked, he's a biologist.

42
00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.620
Could you please stop lying to me to come back?

43
00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.420
Me, what mother would dare to play with her child's life?

44
00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:09.460
An An has been dead for four days.

45
00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.380
Every time I come home

46
00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:13.840
You will see that An An is dead.

47
00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.100
You lied to me, didn't you?

48
00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.380
You two lied to me together, right?

49
00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.300
You are because of these two.

50
00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:22.500
Kill An An.

51
00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:24.940
You're mean.

52
00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.460
There are many men in this world, you do not seduce, you just seduce the owner.

53
00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.360
Is someone else's stuff that good?

54
00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.620
I'm not. I'm not.

55
00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.820
That's enough, between me and Zhuren innocent.

56
00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:39.940
Don't think so badly.

57
00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:42.360
Brother An.

58
00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:43.340
Death has something to do with me.

59
00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.140
Blame me, but it has nothing to do with the two of you.

60
00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:48.920
They're innocent.

61
00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:49.940
Deputy Hoai An

62
00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.040
You're so good.

63
00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.400
If you really want to be a nurse.

64
00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.080
I respect you as a man.

65
00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:59.220
I didn't expect you to be a dirty loser.

66
00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.540
Hey, are you okay?

67
00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:11.080
I'm pregnant, tomorrow is a secret burial.

68
00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:13.540
I'll give you one last chance.

69
00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.020
One last time.

70
00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:18.660
