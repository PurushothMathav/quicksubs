00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:04.280
Hear or not?

2
00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:06.160
Okay, stop playing.

3
00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:07.520
Come and eat.

4
00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:08.940
I've ordered rice.

5
00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.100
What is this?

6
00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:13.660
Good food, I'll try it first.

7
00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.340
Laughing for two days.

8
00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:21.660
I've lost you to An An.

9
00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.400
Hey, Mr. Deer, do you still like the wrench finger I gave you?

10
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.520
I like it as long as you give it to me.

11
00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.900
I've got you safely now.

12
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.040
It's time for me to go home.

13
00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.740
Mr. Deer, it's getting late.

14
00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:43.540
If you don't leave it at home, don't you have a headache?

15
00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:45.720
My massage technique is very good.

16
00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:47.320
I'll give you a massage.

17
00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.020
Spring peach.

18
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.380
Clear the room next to me.

19
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.500
Let Deer's brother live there.

20
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.480
Baby has grown up

21
00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:57.860
It hurts.

22
00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.680
Yes, brother Lu is good to me.

23
00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.740
Of course I have to love you.

24
00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:04.760
Don't you have an opinion?

25
00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.140
Of course he's fine.

26
00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.300
The biggest advantage of Pho Hoai An is his independent personality.

27
00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.720
"I'm stuck this time because I work so hard."

28
00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.180
I take care of you more.

29
00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.500
If the deputy has no opinion

30
00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:21.720
Then I'll stay.

31
00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:22.980
Deputy talent please

32
00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.500
Honey, wait for me.
