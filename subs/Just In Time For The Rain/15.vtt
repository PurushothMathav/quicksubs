00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:06.160
Lord, what are you doing?

2
00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:07.120
You can't do that.

3
00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:09.800
Get out. This is my house.

4
00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:11.700
Whatever I like.

5
00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:13.380
It's not your turn to plead guilty.

6
00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:20.160
The King

7
00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.400
Why are your clothes and shoes gone?

8
00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.600
I don't know. I don't know anything.

9
00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.760
I know where those things go.

10
00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:32.100
Military, don't throw it all away.

11
00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:34.700
Military, what are you talking about?

12
00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:36.000
I'm not talking shit.

13
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.380
When you were young, you forgot that you threw with me.

14
00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:43.100
Throwing it in a mass grave outside stinks.

15
00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.000
How?

16
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.500
My daughter is dead.

17
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.140
How to Make Even Her Last Healing Magic in This World

18
00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:58.860
Why are you so bad?

19
00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:03.380
Such a cruel young age

20
00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.140
It's actually the top salary, not the bottom salary.

21
00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.160
Who told you to mess with your safety?

22
00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.960
Xiao An.

23
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.320
He pushed us both out into the hallway.

24
00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:15.740
Good night.

25
00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.460
Looks like we're in love.

26
00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.700
Five thousand. What are you doing?
