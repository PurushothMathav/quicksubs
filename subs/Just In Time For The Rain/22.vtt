00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:03.400
Hi.

2
00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:05.460
Excuse me.

3
00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:07.940
I didn't know Zhu was such a person.

4
00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:11.020
I thought you were just jealous.

5
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:13.060
Can't let go of a peaceful death

6
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:15.180
Blame him.

7
00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.260
The King's Prior

8
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:19.980
Just trust

9
00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:22.060
I want to believe

10
00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:23.600
Do you really love me?

11
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:24.840
Of course I love you.

12
00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:25.980
You're confident.

13
00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:27.760
Independence

14
00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.100
Beautiful teeth.

15
00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:32.120
The family is good.

16
00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:33.180
I help Zhu Nhien.

17
00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.300
Just because...

18
00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.340
They're the opposite of me.

19
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:42.780
Too weak.

20
00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.640
I don't know anything.

21
00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:46.780
So...

22
00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:49.300
When something happens

23
00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:53.020
You will be unconscious.

24
00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.140
Choose to save them first.

25
00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.300
Because my house is small.

26
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.280
They deserve to be ignored.

27
00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.200
My safety is worth dying for.

28
00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.300
It's not like this.

29
00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.220
That's right.

30
00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:10.620
I just feel like they make me miserable.

31
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.180
I swear I didn't do anything.

32
00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:15.940
From today on.

33
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.620
I'll get rid of him.

34
00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.140
You give me one more time

35
00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:25.380
Right.

36
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.820
This knife is you let me down.

37
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.020
This knife is because you think you're right.

38
00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.380
Killed my safety.

39
00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.140
This one.

40
00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:47.220
Because you hurt me this time.

41
00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.580
The illusion is as good as the beginning

42
00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:55.420
I don't blame you.

43
00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:00.580
These three knives.

44
00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.020
Squeeze one hand.

45
00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:05.540
Both of us.

46
00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:07.300
Child.

47
00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:09.580
What's going on?

48
00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:13.240
The Light

49
00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:15.340
Don't come with me.

50
00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:17.620
As long as you are small.

51
00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:19.100
What?

52
00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.660
I can do that.
