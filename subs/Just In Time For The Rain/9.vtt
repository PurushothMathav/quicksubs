00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.820
Sweetie, I know you're still angry at me.

2
00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:14.540
Whether you hit me or yelled at me, I'll admit it.

3
00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:15.540
But it's so noisy.

4
00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:18.800
You want to know how they can make money raising kids.

5
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.800
Didn t you force him to die?

6
00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:21.600
Vice President

7
00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:23.740
If you love nature.

8
00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.000
He raised it and its building.

9
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.340
As long as he's out.

10
00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.260
I'll let him scream like a rat across the street.

11
00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:32.700
And this one.

12
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.100
This is what you bought him with my dowry.

13
00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.100
I'll make him spit it all out.

14
00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:40.980
I already told you.

15
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.840
There is no guilt between me and Zhu.

16
00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.080
We're just friends.

17
00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:46.400
Don't let your heart get dirty, see what's bad.

18
00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.840
Friends are more important than safety.

19
00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.580
When the blood clot in An An dried.

20
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.580
You're saving your friend.

21
00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.380
As An An lay in the cold coffin, he was walking with his friend's daughter.

22
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.400
I really think An An is an animal.

23
00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:06.820
Fo Huai An, when you saved your mother Zhu Nhien

24
00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:08.880
An An is bleeding a lot.

25
00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.060
He asked me many times.

26
00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.240
Why didn't my father come to save me?

27
00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:14.920
Does he not need me anymore?

28
00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.480
Vice Hoai An, when I call your name

29
00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:19.020
If you turn your head

30
00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.180
You can see An An is bleeding.

31
00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.460
Maybe An An will not die.

32
00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:26.140
Ball Bearings

33
00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.040
They're all An An's killers.

34
00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.540
Can you sleep at night?

35
00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.680
When you lose too much blood

36
00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.340
When he's cold.

37
00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:36.840
Can you hear me?

38
00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.980
Don't talk, don't talk.

39
00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:41.520
I'm sorry An An.

40
00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.140
It's all my fault.

41
00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:44.540
But miss

42
00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:46.580
These.

43
00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:50.060
It has nothing to do with their daughter.

44
00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.120
He was a well-dressed lady.

45
00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:54.300
Become like this.

46
00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:56.260
It's been hard.

47
00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:58.000
frivolous

48
00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:00.740
I'm so sorry.

49
00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.600
I'm so sorry I married you.

50
00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:10.060
I am so sorry to have found an animal who does not know how to be a father.

51
00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:13.740
I'm reasonable.

52
00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.180
Mom, hug me.
