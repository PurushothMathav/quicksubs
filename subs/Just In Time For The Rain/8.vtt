1
00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:07.580
Buried.

2
00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:09.400
Didn't I tell you to wait for me?

3
00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:11.500
Why did you bury him?

4
00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.280
Are you worth it?

5
00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:19.160
Someone you don't want to be safe first.

6
00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.260
The person who used to be called An An is ultimately my fault.

7
00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:24.620
As a result, both of them are in poor health.

8
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.380
So why wait peacefully for you?

9
00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.360
Or do you think An An is dead anyway, waiting for you?

10
00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.060
It's not paid like that.

11
00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:42.180
You know how An An died one day, if you are a little more careful, you will find you.

12
00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:44.820
The rope on my nail is dirty.

13
00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.160
Impossible, basically not worthy of An An hair.

14
00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.100
You don't deserve to be a great man.

15
00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.660
Sister, I'm sorry.

16
00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.520
The army is not in good health.

17
00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.200
Good night, I'm afraid the Army will not be able to stand in prison.

18
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.820
That's why I came to eat.

19
00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.680
Sister, hit me.

20
00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.480
Don't argue with me because of me.

21
00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:09.180
It's like I'm begging you.

22
00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.580
You're good.

23
00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.320
It really saved him.

24
00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.380
It is true that his general died and wanted to steal from others.

25
00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:24.740
His daughter's father no longer had to steal from others.

26
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.920
Is someone else's husband particularly good?

27
00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.180
Sister, I don't have it.

28
00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:32.460
The daughter of a sinner.

29
00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:34.740
Also known as the princess's sister.

30
00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:39.100
Lord Hoai An looks at us poor orphans and widows

31
00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:42.860
That's why they took care of us.

32
00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.480
I, in my heart, thank you.

33
00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:48.740
How could it destroy your family?

34
00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:49.720
Hoai An

35
00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:51.820
I really don't.

36
00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:56.260
I know you're my wife.

37
00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.340
An An's death is my crime.

38
00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:02.020
But of course they have nothing to do with each other.

39
00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.140
You're cold, you go away.

40
00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.140
Get out!

41
00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:11.820
It was all wrong from the beginning.

42
00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:14.040
Hey.

43
00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:18.500
Sister, how can you break the flag?

44
00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.240
How can I cancel the flag?

45
00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:21.700
If the back is the enemy

46
00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:23.820
Why not pass the rubicon

47
00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.760
Fragrance, cooling on the ground.

48
00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:31.680
Brother takes you home

49
00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.480
I have saved Zhu Nhien.

50
00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:39.640
He saved the baby.

51
00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.180
No, don't leave it to Vice.

52
00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:43.780
Our whole family.

53
00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.540
I want to be reasonable with loneliness.

54
00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.700
Big Brother helped Lu Ming return.

55
00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:51.340
I told him to investigate.

56
00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:54.300
Don't worry, he has a way.
