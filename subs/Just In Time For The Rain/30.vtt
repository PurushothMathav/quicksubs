00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:01.080
You are feet.

2
00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:05.140
Well, you tell him.

3
00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:07.860
Before it's okay to save a child

4
00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:09.180
It's been interrupted.

5
00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:11.340
But you saw it too.

6
00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:12.720
Does not affect walking.

7
00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:15.540
I can't eat the needle in my right hand.

8
00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:17.180
It was also broken yesterday.

9
00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:18.340
What do you say?

10
00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:20.380
Is it a newspaper?

11
00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:21.940
I should go.

12
00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:23.680
Yes.

13
00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:26.120
Color: Green

14
00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.680
I went to the cemetery.

15
00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.500
But we didn't find An An's tombstone.

16
00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:32.740
Right.

17
00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:34.980
You said this.

18
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.600
I brought the tombstone to An An.

19
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:39.420
What about the money?

20
00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:41.360
Where is it?

21
00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:42.160
The girl.

22
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:43.700
Don't bother anymore.

23
00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.940
Follow the hospital where the child is alive.

24
00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:48.380
He said he wanted to.

25
00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:52.100
Let your girlfriend go.

26
00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:54.900
I won't bother him anymore.

27
00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:57.180
Let's go.

28
00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:03.980
That's right, 10 months later.

29
00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.020
I married the village chief.

30
00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:07.220
And...

31
00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:08.900
The Bank

32
00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.020
We will continue to stop you.

33
00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:25.120
Congratulations.

34
00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:26.720
Congratulations.

35
00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.060
Congratulations.

36
00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:36.560
The Light

37
00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:38.520
I finally married you.

38
00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.780
I will definitely be happy this time.

39
00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.540
You and your clients.

40
00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.100
Look at him.

41
00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:14.640
What do I have to do?

42
00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.820
Good night.

43
00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.500
Your brother is finally with you.

44
00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.860
Sunny, I'm sorry.

45
00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:23.540
Congratulations.

46
00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:25.780
Happiness
