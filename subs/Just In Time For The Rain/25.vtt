00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:03.460
No.

2
00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:06.800
You dress like this and get it.

3
00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:10.820
He hasn't slept well lately, he needs me.

4
00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:13.580
I gave him a massage.

5
00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:16.700
So your shooter is unknown.

6
00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.660
What kind of system are you?

7
00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:21.980
The case of my father pregnant me and Loc Van

8
00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:23.900
It's very clean.

9
00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:26.140
I just consider him a brother.

10
00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:29.620
Don't get yourself dirty, see if everything is dirty.

11
00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:31.300
I already told you.

12
00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.540
Between me and Zhuren is innocent, we are just friends.

13
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.660
Don't get your heart dirty.

14
00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:38.180
Everything is dirty.

15
00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.540
Seven, I've made that clear.

16
00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:02.980
I agree reasonably.

17
00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.900
I didn't realize I would harm you and An An so much.

18
00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.380
I thought you were independent, you didn't need me anymore.

19
00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.220
But it's not in your position to think about the problem.

20
00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:14.820
I'm an unreal husband.

21
00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:20.720
The Light

22
00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.640
You... Can you forgive me?

23
00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:24.620
No.

24
00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.340
What right do you have for me to ask others to forgive you?

25
00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:32.900
What qualifications do I have?

26
00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:02.640
Him.

27
00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:04.740
It's gone.

28
00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:12.340
Mr. Deer has been thanking you for helping me with the play these days.

29
00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.940
I told you if you need to.

30
00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:17.500
I'm here any time.

31
00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.960
Yes.
