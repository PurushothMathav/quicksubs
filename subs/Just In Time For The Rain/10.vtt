00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.060
Mom.

2
00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:05.700
Oh, you're finally home.

3
00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:10.040
Then I hate you. What are you going to do?

4
00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:11.460
He just left.

5
00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:12.680
Are you sick?

6
00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:13.800
Or you'll die.

7
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:15.260
Nam Nam, let's go.

8
00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:17.820
Right.

9
00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:19.880
Are you sick?

10
00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:21.060
If you get sick, you die.

11
00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.260
Qingdao Dragon Boat

12
00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:24.480
Child.

13
00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.540
Child, what do you want to do?

14
00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:31.900
I'll go find him.

15
00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:37.720
Young Child, your enemy has not yet reported.

16
00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:39.860
You can't do anything stupid, don't worry.

17
00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.160
Your brother kicked your mother and son out of that house.

18
00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.340
And I've investigated.

19
00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:49.440
Pay them, it costs 9,000 taels in total.

20
00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.460
I will let them give it all back.

21
00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:55.500
Only if the payment has not been agreed to part.

22
00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.180
Go ahead.

23
00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.740
Call me anytime if you have anything.

24
00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.080
The Light

25
00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.460
I bought you your favorite waffle cake.

26
00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:14.780
Okay.

27
00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:16.900
The hospital borrows your 9,000.

28
00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.040
I'll find a way to return it to you.

29
00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.740
Can you stop pursuing her responsibilities?

30
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.180
Let me let you go.

31
00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.160
Sunny, I know you hate me

32
00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:29.400
Whatever you do to me.

33
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.140
Could you please stop targeting Zhuren's mother and son?

34
00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.040
They're really innocent.

35
00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:34.840
Innocent.

36
00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:37.080
What about An An?

37
00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.500
An An deserves to die, right?

38
00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:42.220
You have children.

39
00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.380
Do you know how hard it is to be natural?

40
00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:45.960
You ask him to return the money now.

41
00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.420
Didn't you force him to die?

42
00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:54.660
All those who harm An An, I will not forgive anyone.

43
00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:55.720
Mom

44
00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:57.660
How can you become like this?

45
00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:59.980
Haha.

46
00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:02.700
But mine doesn't know yet.

47
00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.820
You will see my true wickedness immediately.

48
00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:09.740
This time

49
00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:13.340
You have to keep watch, it's okay.

50
00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.020
And tell them.

51
00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:16.780
We have to hide it.

52
00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:20.140
Without man-made disasters

53
00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.620
When did you fall into their heads?

54
00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.980
You, you have to go.

55
00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.880
Dear, have you been visiting An An for so long?

56
00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.500
When you dream of peace at midnight

57
00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.560
Won't you feel guilty?

58
00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:42.860
The last time I called you, did you ever think it would be the last time?

59
00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:45.540
Before An goes

60
00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:47.340
Call me.

61
00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:48.820
An An said

62
00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:51.100
next life

63
00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:54.700
He wants to change you.
