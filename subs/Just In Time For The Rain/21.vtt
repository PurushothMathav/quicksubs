00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:04.220
The Lord God s patience is limited.

2
00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:07.280
You called me here just to see you on your knees.

3
00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:11.720
Lord, can you only force me to die so that you can have fun?

4
00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:16.500
Lord, you have a good family and married a good husband.

5
00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:19.680
And I have nothing.

6
00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:20.680
I just want to live.

7
00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:21.920
Am I wrong?

8
00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:23.840
My dad just wants to live.

9
00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:24.840
Is he wrong?

10
00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.060
When my house is not in trouble

11
00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.940
I'm also a pastime.

12
00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.040
I know that Pho Hoai An likes me.

13
00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:34.400
But how could he be a poor student worthy of me?

14
00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.140
Until the Zhou family had an accident.

15
00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.520
He came to help me.

16
00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:42.100
Seriously, I ve seen him defend me in front of you over and over again.

17
00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:43.960
I'm happy.

18
00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.180
You guys are really in the clock.

19
00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.280
Neither of those is a good thing.

20
00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.380
I thought...

21
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.620
He still can't let go.

22
00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:56.780
I seduced him.

23
00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:58.540
But he said

24
00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:00.980
Think of me as a sister.

25
00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:04.020
Say we're poor orphans and widows.

26
00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:07.180
Say he only likes you

27
00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.300
So you hate me

28
00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:11.740
Hate my child.

29
00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.140
The day of the accident.

30
00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:17.680
The army saw the blood on the An An, right?

31
00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:18.480
No.

32
00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:20.720
The army didn't say.

33
00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:22.780
I thought it wouldn't be that bad.

34
00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.620
I I just

35
00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:31.060
I just want to check if he still has me.

36
00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:33.600
You shameless whore.

37
00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.160
For your own desire

38
00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:36.620
You killed our lady.

39
00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:37.780
Kill you!

40
00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:41.920
Lord, what can you do?

41
00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.300
Wasn t it still my turn to protect me?

42
00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.260
Now you hit me.

43
00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.400
Just push him for me.

44
00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:49.700
Phu Hoa An

45
00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.280
I don't want to.

46
00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.580
It has been sent to you, Deputy Hoai An.

47
00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:56.300
Let's go.

48
00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.620
Want to hear when?

49
00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.920
Please.

50
00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.340
Sorry the most sorry friend

51
00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:08.380
Right.

52
00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:11.100
Spring, let's go.

53
00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.160
Yes...

54
00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.380
Listen to me explain.

55
00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.000
Ah.

56
00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:23.320
Yes...

57
00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:24.720
Yes...

58
00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:28.500
I'm sorry.

59
00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.300
It's all my fault.

60
00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:31.700
But miss

61
00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.700
This has nothing to do with their parents.

62
00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.800
He was a well-dressed lady.

63
00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:39.980
Become like this.

64
00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.140
It's been hard.

65
00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.340
So you hate me

66
00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:46.780
And hate my child.

67
00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.220
The day of the accident.

68
00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.840
The army saw the blood on the An An, right?

69
00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:53.640
Yes.

70
00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:55.720
Qin Quan did not say.

71
00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.780
I thought it wouldn't be that bad.

72
00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.700
I I just

73
00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:06.060
I just want to check if he still has me.

74
00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:07.980
Phuc Hoai An

75
00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.100
What are you waiting for?

76
00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:14.020
Sunny's right.

77
00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:18.340
You're just a piece of trash who can't bring anything in.
