00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:06.240
There is still some distance between us, are you tired?

2
00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:07.640
Do you want me to carry you?

3
00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:08.780
I'm not tired.

4
00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.460
Oh my God.

5
00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:20.100
Don't squeeze the cake point, throw the cake point, then take off.

6
00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:24.120
My flowers are okay.

7
00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:26.460
Yeah, right?

8
00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:30.100
Fo Huai An, when you saved your mother Zhu Nhien

9
00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:32.080
An An is bleeding a lot.

10
00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:33.860
He asked me many times.

11
00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.480
Why didn't my brother come to save me?

12
00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.120
Does he not need me anymore?

13
00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.940
When I call your name, just turn your head.

14
00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.420
You can see An An is bleeding.

15
00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.620
Maybe An An will not die.

16
00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:48.780
You and suddenly

17
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.320
They're all An An's killers.

18
00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.180
Can you sleep at night?

19
00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.700
When An An lost too much blood, he said when he was cold.

20
00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:59.260
Can you hear me?

21
00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:01.720
You want to starve me?

22
00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:03.440
Go and cook for me.

23
00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:07.440
What you are, you have to take care of me.

24
00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:13.020
You have to take care of me if you change your mind, I will kill you.

25
00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.660
Here you are, tired?

26
00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:19.820
It's you.
