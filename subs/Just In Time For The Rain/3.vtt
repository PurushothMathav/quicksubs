00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.180
Why are you here?

2
00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:03.860
What about An An?

3
00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.020
It's disturbing the family of three.

4
00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:08.920
Sunny, you misunderstood.

5
00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:10.200
Military, he's sick.

6
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.720
I found them the widows talking rather pitifully.

7
00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:14.440
Can this help your roommate?

8
00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:15.340
You're so kind.

9
00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:17.900
You will surely understand my understanding.

10
00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:21.340
What about An An?

11
00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.540
When you saved their mother and son, did you ever think about safety?

12
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.200
What are you eating here?

13
00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:27.760
I just came because of An An.

14
00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:29.180
He's a friend.

15
00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.500
OK, you take care of An An again, I'll be right back. Go home.

16
00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:39.240
Do we have a house?

17
00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:40.040
Yes...

18
00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:43.500
You know, he put it back together.

19
00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:45.560
Come see what's wrong with the army.

20
00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.700
Don't be afraid, we'll be right there.

21
00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.680
How do I go to see the Army?

22
00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:52.700
If he's okay, I'll be right back.

23
00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:55.300
Deputy Hoai An

24
00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:57.360
Never saw An again.

25
00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:58.600
What are you talking about?

26
00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.460
I said Vice Hoai An.

27
00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:03.520
You'll never see An again.

28
00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:05.180
Because he's dead.

29
00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:07.780
There used to be a lot of mothers.

30
00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:09.860
Jealous.

31
00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:11.660
You lock your son up.

32
00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.620
Oh, come back.

33
00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.180
Wait for me to come home with my aunt.

34
00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.460
Spring peach peach

35
00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.040
Miss, you have a fever.

36
00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.220
The general is back.

37
00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.380
Miss.

38
00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.900
You said the Army broke its head today.

39
00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:49.820
They can't live without him.

40
00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:51.580
Tell him to find another doctor quickly.

41
00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:57.140
Deputy Hoai An is dead.

42
00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:59.740
There's no one else.

43
00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.340
It bothers you and your mother.

44
00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:04.540
It's fun.
