1
00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:04.280
Child.

2
00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.620
The taste of eating fruit

3
00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:11.020
Mr. Deer, I said Vice.

4
00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:12.780
Will serve you.

5
00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:15.380
In fact, he cooks well.

6
00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:18.080
Why not let him make you one day to taste?

7
00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:19.800
I really know how to serve people.

8
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.360
His arm was injured so he could work.

9
00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:24.740
Come to Mr. Deer for an apple.

10
00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.960
Open your mouth.

11
00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.600
Your general is still here. Look here.

12
00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:31.140
Won't he misunderstand us?

13
00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:32.820
Misunderstand us what?

14
00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:34.440
You're my brother.

15
00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.160
Feed your brother, what's wrong?

16
00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.840
If you don't want to tell me.

17
00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.480
Mr. Deer, let's go to the restaurant.

18
00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.500
There's no dream I would do

19
00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:49.300
That's hard work, deputy.

20
00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.260
Is Mr. Deer good?

21
00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.900
Salt, you sell salt.

22
00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:59.960
Do a lot of things no one can eat.

23
00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.560
Mr. Deer, let's go to the restaurant.

24
00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:05.900
Not to be poisoned by him.

25
00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:08.220
All right, let's go.

26
00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.500
After lunch, he took me for a walk.

27
00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.820
I heard they've got a new set of gestures.

28
00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.420
I see you're missing a wrench.

29
00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:21.800
Baby wants to buy you one for free.

30
00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.060
Okay, then thank you, Sunny.

31
00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.760
What do we both say thank you for?

32
00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:30.400
From small to big, except for my brother, you are the best person for me.

33
00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:34.100
Dear, am I really happy if you take revenge like this?

34
00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:37.140
You think too much.

35
00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:41.200
Mr. Deer and I were just walking down the street eating.

36
00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.300
Don't be too thoughtful.

37
00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:47.500
Deer, I'm hungry. Let's go.
