00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.220
I heard you.

2
00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:04.000
It's him, he wants me dead.

3
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.980
Go find him and calculate for me.

4
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.060
What would I do if you died?

5
00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:12.400
Juanjuan's mother

6
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.220
Sorry, you said she wasn't good.

7
00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.980
They can't give you a good life.

8
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.580
What do you want?

9
00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:22.880
Do you have to force Zhu Yuan to die before you can be satisfied?

10
00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:23.800
This general.

11
00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.480
He wanted to die a long time ago.

12
00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.960
If he really wants to die, die quietly.

13
00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:30.980
How can you show off like that?

14
00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:35.300
Not afraid of people laughing

15
00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:38.660
Wanting to set fire is my husband's outer room.

16
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.060
For this outside room

17
00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.220
He didn't just kill our daughter.

18
00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.840
And secretly used my dowry sticker.

19
00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.040
I can't make him lose money.

20
00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.900
He didn't want to pay for doing so deliberately.

21
00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:52.900
And everyone.

22
00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.420
You can take your general seriously.

23
00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.080
As long as he lives here.

24
00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:58.420
We cannot guarantee any day.

25
00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:01.920
You will end up like me.

26
00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.240
Teasing people's husbands kills people.

27
00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:05.300
There's no shame.

28
00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:07.680
Turns out it's these dogs.

29
00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.620
Take someone else's dowry to subsidize it.

30
00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.780
The Soft Rice Man

31
00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.680
You son of a bitch, get out of here!

32
00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:16.200
Don't live in this alley.

33
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.360
I am not ashamed of Ho.

34
00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:18.320
Are you going to cry?

35
00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.240
People aren't crying yet, what are you crying about?

36
00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:21.380
Get out.

37
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.520
Don't let me see you again.

38
00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.420
Get out, get out.
