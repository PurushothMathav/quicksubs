00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:06.740
Is Joon-joon okay?

2
00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:08.960
It's not very good.

3
00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:11.860
He used to have math problems.

4
00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.180
Now I'm scared.

5
00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:18.500
Hoai An, did you say the army could not bear it?

6
00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.720
Don't worry, the army's fine.

7
00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:22.640
Just rest on time.

8
00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.240
The army blamed her for being useless.

9
00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:26.560
Can't protect you.

10
00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.900
Now the princess is famous everywhere.

11
00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:32.060
We were kicked out again.

12
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.540
What about your illness?

13
00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.020
You have been kicked out by Ku Thanh.

14
00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:41.140
I told you you were lonely.

15
00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:43.660
I'll go find him.

16
00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.140
Thank you for your help during this time.

17
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:52.940
Without you

18
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.500
Things can't be resolved that quickly.

19
00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.540
Child, we grew up together.

20
00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:00.640
When did you see me like that?

21
00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.660
Someone at the film crew gate sent you a note.

22
00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.180
I'll meet you tomorrow at Xuan Lai Tea House.

23
00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:12.640
He can't take it anymore.

24
00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:13.440
The past

25
00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:15.320
Did you send someone to threaten the army?

26
00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:16.440
He's weak.

27
00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:19.040
Aren t you afraid of him dying?

28
00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:20.660
Why should I be afraid of Gu Khanh?

29
00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.040
I'm just reminding you that if the Army dies,

30
00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.860
The whole betrayal will be involved.

31
00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:27.940
I'm doing this for your benefit.

32
00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:30.700
Good for me.

33
00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.940
For me, do you think it's the Lord?

34
00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.100
Security is gone.

35
00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.260
My heart died a long time ago.

36
00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:45.440
I just want them to survive in Kyoto.

37
00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.160
Why are you so aggressive?

38
00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:48.300
I barely know you.

39
00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.020
What a coincidence, Deputy Hoai An.

40
00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.140
I think...

41
00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.620
Never recognized you

42
00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.500
Now get out of our house.

43
00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.100
That's right.

44
00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.380
Tomorrow comes the spring tea farmers

45
00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:06.740
I have a surprise.

46
00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.420
For you.
