00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:01.300
You dare to touch my father, try it

2
00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:03.600
I'll take him to the hospital

3
00:00:03.666 --> 00:00:05.533
You clearly want to kill

4
00:00:05.533 --> 00:00:07.100
My father was bullied like this by you

5
00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:08.166
Must lose money

6
00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:09.333
If you don't pay

7
00:00:09.333 --> 00:00:11.066
I will bury my father in your store

8
00:00:11.066 --> 00:00:13.333
Bridge, let me say

9
00:00:13.333 --> 00:00:15.033
This whole thing is your fault

10
00:00:15.166 --> 00:00:16.366
Don't say it.

11
00:00:16.733 --> 00:00:18.666
You're always looking for trouble

12
00:00:18.666 --> 00:00:19.666
I advise you.

13
00:00:19.666 --> 00:00:21.866
Child, hurry up and lose money, lose money

14
00:00:22.566 --> 00:00:24.066
You think beautifully

15
00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:24.900
bridge

16
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.400
How dare you lie in front of everyone?

17
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:30.366
That's right, there are so many witnesses here today.

18
00:00:30.666 --> 00:00:32.400
It's you who killed Lao Deng

19
00:00:32.666 --> 00:00:34.933
Aren't you bullying honest people?

20
00:00:34.933 --> 00:00:36.800
The boy should be conscientious

21
00:00:37.066 --> 00:00:38.700
You go to jail if you're pissed off

22
00:00:39.133 --> 00:00:40.500
Everyone gets old

23
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:41.700
You will also grow old

24
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.066
What would you do if he were your dad?

25
00:00:44.266 --> 00:00:46.100
The right path in the world is vicissitudes of life

26
00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:47.900
Be low-key, don't be arrogant

27
00:00:48.366 --> 00:00:49.566
I am Chinese today

28
00:00:49.566 --> 00:00:51.800
I'm going to fry a pot for this old man

29
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.000
Come on, let's shout with me

30
00:00:53.333 --> 00:00:56.600
lose money lose money lose money

31
00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:57.800
Fight your head

32
00:00:57.933 --> 00:00:59.100
I'll tell you what.

33
00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:00.733
It's no use shouting here

34
00:01:00.733 --> 00:01:02.200
I won't pay

35
00:01:02.366 --> 00:01:04.200
What's the use of your moral kidnapping?

36
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:05.300
One, two, two.

37
00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:06.533
I didn't do it. I didn't do it.

38
00:01:06.533 --> 00:01:09.000
It was the old man who brought the counterfeit to touch the porcelain

39
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.500
If you want to pay, he should pay.

40
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.233
How dare you frame us

41
00:01:12.266 --> 00:01:13.500
I will fight with you

42
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.300
Hahaha Guan Gong stepped on the horse and fought Changhong

43
00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.066
Since ancient times, people have been poor but not cowardly

44
00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:21.100
Guys, I can't let a store like this exist

45
00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:21.500
It is. It is.

46
00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.633
He emptied all the gas stations in his store

47
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.933
Okay, drag it out. Okay.

48
00:01:26.933 --> 00:01:28.333
Why do you stink?

49
00:01:28.333 --> 00:01:30.033
Don't touch my stuff. What are you doing?
