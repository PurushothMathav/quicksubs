00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:03.600
Bridges are not very famous now

2
00:00:04.066 --> 00:00:05.600
But I concluded that

3
00:00:05.766 --> 00:00:07.000
A-Eclipse

4
00:00:07.533 --> 00:00:10.466
He must be a majestic hum

5
00:00:10.966 --> 00:00:13.033
Isn't it a loss for you to marry him?

6
00:00:14.066 --> 00:00:15.166
What do you think?

7
00:00:15.866 --> 00:00:17.900
Uh sorry angel

8
00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:19.900
I don't think I'm right for him

9
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.300
Let's forget it.

10
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.500
I haven't refused yet, how dare you speak first

11
00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.233
Who do you think you are?

12
00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.533
It's just a mistake, a few times

13
00:00:28.533 --> 00:00:30.800
I really think of myself as an outsider

14
00:00:31.466 --> 00:00:32.400
Tell you

15
00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.966
Those who pursue this girl line up to the sun from here

16
00:00:34.966 --> 00:00:37.666
You say this girl is not worthy of you

17
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:43.233
Oh baby

18
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.400
Hey don't say

19
00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.366
This figure is really not worse than Mr. Feng

20
00:00:48.366 --> 00:00:49.966
Especially those two grapes

21
00:00:49.966 --> 00:00:52.800
Not big, not small, just right, hello

22
00:00:53.566 --> 00:00:55.133
This girl is talking to you

23
00:00:55.133 --> 00:00:56.300
What are you wandering about?

24
00:00:56.866 --> 00:00:57.666
Oh.

25
00:00:58.333 --> 00:01:00.333
I'll tell you the truth

26
00:01:00.333 --> 00:01:01.800
You are really good

27
00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:05.466
It's just that my brother has a higher vision now.

28
00:01:05.866 --> 00:01:07.800
You have a temper

29
00:01:08.166 --> 00:01:09.366
Brother doesn't like you

30
00:01:09.666 --> 00:01:11.866
You dare to say that this girl has a big temper

31
00:01:11.866 --> 00:01:14.500
Little friends don't have to rush to make a decision

32
00:01:14.966 --> 00:01:17.466
I'm leaving Hangzhou in a few days.

33
00:01:17.866 --> 00:01:21.266
You two can make contact first

34
00:01:22.466 --> 00:01:23.600
You don't have to.

35
00:01:26.933 --> 00:01:28.166
That being the case

36
00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.566
The old man does not force

37
00:01:31.166 --> 00:01:34.066
I will help you with opening the store.

38
00:01:34.933 --> 00:01:36.800
Chinese New Year is coming soon.

39
00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.600
Qin, the largest antique dealer in the country, will also come in a few days.

40
00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:46.200
He is going to hold a birthday party on New Year's Eve

41
00:01:46.766 --> 00:01:50.700
Families will offer gifts, you just take him

42
00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.466
Your business will get bigger and bigger

43
00:01:53.566 --> 00:01:54.466
Grandpa

44
00:01:54.533 --> 00:01:56.633
How could you tell him about Qin Ye?

45
00:01:56.766 --> 00:01:59.966
Hey, bridges are not outsiders.

46
00:01:59.966 --> 00:02:02.166
Master Qin will come in two days

47
00:02:02.166 --> 00:02:05.000
He has the final say in this antique circle

48
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.866
He always has a 37% share

49
00:02:08.366 --> 00:02:10.966
Do you have to be prepared for this?

50
00:02:10.966 --> 00:02:14.100
What? I'm only 70%?

51
00:02:15.166 --> 00:02:16.166
Seventy-seven percent.

52
00:02:16.166 --> 00:02:17.866
It's someone else's hum

53
00:02:18.466 --> 00:02:20.366
Then I think it's better to forget it.

54
00:02:20.666 --> 00:02:23.200
Why should I make money and be angry with others?

55
00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:24.433
What are you bumping into?

56
00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.900
My grandfather has to be polite when he sees Master Qin

57
00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:28.000
What are you?

58
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.200
Hmph, with divine eyes

59
00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.100
All the antiques in the world belong to me

60
00:02:33.333 --> 00:02:35.166
What is an antique dealer?

61
00:02:35.466 --> 00:02:37.200
Or ask Mr. Feng for money first

62
00:02:37.966 --> 00:02:39.600
The gambling conference is over

63
00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.100
Can I give you a chance to meet me?

64
00:02:43.566 --> 00:02:45.500
It took so long

65
00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:49.166
Then we'll meet when it's over.
