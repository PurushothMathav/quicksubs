00:00:00.466 --> 00:00:01.400
Here it is.

2
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:13.966
Sure enough, it was the wrench

3
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:17.500
Where did you get this wrench from?

4
00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.000
You say this?

5
00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:21.566
It was given to me by a good friend of mine.

6
00:00:21.566 --> 00:00:24.033
It came from a street stall

7
00:00:24.066 --> 00:00:27.066
In terms of appearance and preciousness

8
00:00:27.266 --> 00:00:29.233
This is the best

9
00:00:29.666 --> 00:00:32.166
The old man likes it very much, right?

10
00:00:32.766 --> 00:00:33.666
It's not right.

11
00:00:33.666 --> 00:00:35.600
You said he was fake.

12
00:00:36.366 --> 00:00:37.633
Will you watch

13
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.333
Do you understand?

14
00:00:39.333 --> 00:00:41.733
Don't think the old man complimented you

15
00:00:41.733 --> 00:00:43.666
Right here talking nonsense

16
00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:45.866
Angel, I'm just saying it's not right.

17
00:00:45.866 --> 00:00:47.300
Because it's unlucky.

18
00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:47.866
big brother

19
00:00:47.866 --> 00:00:50.200
If you wear it for a long time, it will hurt your body.

20
00:00:50.333 --> 00:00:51.133
Nonsense

21
00:00:51.666 --> 00:00:53.400
This is feudal superstition

22
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.366
Pure slander

23
00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.666
The old man has seen the baby for a lifetime

24
00:00:57.666 --> 00:00:59.200
Never been a teacher

25
00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:02.433
Do you really think you are stronger than this old man?

26
00:01:02.666 --> 00:01:04.300
It's really a theft

27
00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:06.733
Oops, bridge teacher

28
00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:08.566
In fact, you can question

29
00:01:08.566 --> 00:01:09.866
Shut up now

30
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.500
Master, is there really something wrong with this thing?

31
00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.266
Who gave this thing to you?

32
00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:16.866
He must be trying to hurt you

33
00:01:16.866 --> 00:01:18.400
You are now black gas weak body

34
00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:19.666
It won't take three days.

35
00:01:19.866 --> 00:01:21.166
You will be innocent

36
00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:22.500
Yeah!

37
00:01:25.666 --> 00:01:27.766
This is killing the old man

38
00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.966
Xiaobai chased him away from me

39
00:01:29.966 --> 00:01:31.400
Is there really something wrong with this thing?

40
00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.766
Are you still stubborn?

41
00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:34.866
Let it out

42
00:01:34.866 --> 00:01:37.766
No one needs to buy his baby for the whole voyage

43
00:01:37.766 --> 00:01:40.300
No one needs to make a deal with him

44
00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.233
You're going to leave him dead on the street

45
00:01:45.566 --> 00:01:47.133
Hurry up angel

46
00:01:47.133 --> 00:01:49.100
If you feel unwell these two days

47
00:01:49.166 --> 00:01:51.366
Make sure to break that wrench for him

48
00:01:51.466 --> 00:01:52.733
It might save your life

49
00:01:52.733 --> 00:01:53.533
Oops angel

50
00:01:53.533 --> 00:01:54.833
You must remember that.
