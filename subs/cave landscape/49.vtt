00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:03.200
Hey, you said I think this is still dead

2
00:00:03.933 --> 00:00:05.500
It feels like there should be a rainbow

3
00:00:07.866 --> 00:00:10.566
Oops, just buy this messy one.

4
00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:13.566
How can there be any good predictions in this place?

5
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:15.366
You don't understand this

6
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:19.100
The more this kind of place, the easier it is to come up with good stuff

7
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:20.333
Then you choose

8
00:00:20.333 --> 00:00:21.666
I'll pay you after picking

9
00:00:23.266 --> 00:00:24.400
Ouch.

10
00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:28.400
What a coincidence, dear, why are you here?

11
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.766
What a coincidence, Yoyo, are you here too?

12
00:00:30.766 --> 00:00:32.900
Haha, there are still a lot of confidantes

13
00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.200
This kind of place can have old friends

14
00:00:36.933 --> 00:00:38.100
He is a boy!

15
00:00:39.333 --> 00:00:40.566
No wonder you reject me.

16
00:00:40.566 --> 00:00:42.366
So you like this tone

17
00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:45.900
You're so disgusting, don't talk nonsense

18
00:00:46.933 --> 00:00:48.600
Ouch.

19
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.400
We are here this time to get some rough stones.

20
00:00:51.533 --> 00:00:53.466
Can you recommend it to us?

21
00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.766
You are looking for me, why did you find the right person?

22
00:00:56.766 --> 00:00:59.800
Well, we just came in with a new batch of goods.

23
00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.500
And the boss is here.

24
00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.900
Oh, let's hurry or it'll be too late.

25
00:01:05.066 --> 00:01:07.366
Go go

26
00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:09.600
boss

27
00:01:10.366 --> 00:01:13.066
We got company. Hey

28
00:01:13.066 --> 00:01:16.566
Okay, just look at me here, they are all good goods.

29
00:01:16.566 --> 00:01:18.466
As long as you cut the fart, it rises sharply

30
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:20.300
Yo

31
00:01:20.766 --> 00:01:22.000
Why are you here?

32
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.900
Oh, I see.

33
00:01:24.266 --> 00:01:25.666
All your goods have been detained.

34
00:01:25.666 --> 00:01:27.800
You want to try your luck here, right?

35
00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:28.600
Ah!

36
00:01:29.066 --> 00:01:30.800
Master Fang, you know each other

37
00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:31.966
Of course!

38
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.433
Let me introduce you

39
00:01:33.766 --> 00:01:37.066
This is the famous bridge.

40
00:01:37.066 --> 00:01:38.500
A store about to open

41
00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.500
But there's nothing decent in the store

42
00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:42.700
Antique dealer

43
00:01:44.366 --> 00:01:45.600
It's alright bro

44
00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:46.733
Since you are here, brother

45
00:01:46.733 --> 00:01:47.700
All friends

46
00:01:47.733 --> 00:01:49.366
Tell my brother what you like.

47
00:01:49.366 --> 00:01:52.266
But still waiting for Young Master Fang to finish picking first?

48
00:01:52.266 --> 00:01:55.200
Why is my grandfather Chen Tianshi?

49
00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:56.433
Let's pick first

50
00:01:56.466 --> 00:01:58.700
Oh, it's Miss Chen.

51
00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:59.866
Oops disrespect disrespect

52
00:02:00.066 --> 00:02:02.366
But I still have to wait for Fang Shao to choose first

53
00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:04.033
Because it's the rule

54
00:02:04.066 --> 00:02:05.866
So did your grandfather when he came

55
00:02:06.266 --> 00:02:07.200
Yeah.

56
00:02:07.766 --> 00:02:09.033
Let him choose first
