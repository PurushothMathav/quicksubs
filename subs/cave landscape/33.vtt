00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.666
Let go of me let go hahaha

2
00:00:02.733 --> 00:00:04.966
Let me hug you too

3
00:00:05.333 --> 00:00:07.866
How dare you hide?

4
00:00:07.866 --> 00:00:09.166
Aren't you responsible for safety?

5
00:00:09.166 --> 00:00:10.700
Don't you care if they bully women?

6
00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:13.066
Really? Why didn't I see you?

7
00:00:13.066 --> 00:00:15.266
Hahaha, what do you love me for?

8
00:00:15.866 --> 00:00:17.700
Let go of me

9
00:00:19.933 --> 00:00:22.200
Brother Hu, why did you come to play together?

10
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.300
Don't you know he's my brother?

11
00:00:24.366 --> 00:00:25.566
Court death, right?

12
00:00:25.566 --> 00:00:28.066
Brother Tiger, it's not that I look down on you

13
00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:32.500
But this bridge is the one that Chen Tian wants to ban

14
00:00:32.533 --> 00:00:33.966
Although you are a gangster brother

15
00:00:33.966 --> 00:00:34.866
But

16
00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:38.700
Publicly support this trash redhead in public

17
00:00:39.066 --> 00:00:40.433
It's not good for you either.

18
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:41.066
Exactly.

19
00:00:41.066 --> 00:00:43.533
Brother Hu, even I know that he has offended Angel Chen.

20
00:00:43.533 --> 00:00:45.733
You'd better hurry up and change the gold ring line with him.

21
00:00:45.733 --> 00:00:47.133
Brother Tiger, don't worry.

22
00:00:47.133 --> 00:00:48.233
After today

23
00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:49.833
They will surely regret it

24
00:00:50.133 --> 00:00:52.566
Hahahahaha regret

25
00:00:52.566 --> 00:00:54.400
I don't know how to write regret

26
00:00:54.533 --> 00:00:55.666
Or bridge

27
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.300
Let's go first

28
00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.233
Don't worry about Angkor

29
00:00:59.466 --> 00:01:00.666
We didn't invite friends.

30
00:01:00.866 --> 00:01:01.900
Can you take us in?

31
00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:03.400
Hahaha kind

32
00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.666
I still have some face

33
00:01:06.666 --> 00:01:07.266
You two

34
00:01:07.266 --> 00:01:10.100
Carry those eyes on your head and wipe them clean for me

35
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.000
Eyeless thing

36
00:01:12.933 --> 00:01:13.733
Let's go

37
00:01:14.933 --> 00:01:17.233
Feng Shui takes turns, Brother Tiger
