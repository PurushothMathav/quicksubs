00:00:05.866 --> 00:00:08.100
Shopping?

3
00:00:08.333 --> 00:00:11.366
Sir, we are an antique shop and do not accept anything.

00:00:11.366 --> 00:00:12.266
girl

5
00:00:13.266 --> 00:00:14.600
Buddha statues in the Tang Dynasty

6
00:00:15.366 --> 00:00:16.566
It's from Wen Yao

7
00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.766
You take 500,000

8
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.633
You uncle

9
00:00:20.866 --> 00:00:23.066
We haven't opened yet, oops.

10
00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.000
I'm here to send you money, hurry up.

11
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.100
I'm short of money 500,000 give me something for you

12
00:00:33.666 --> 00:00:34.466
uncle

13
00:00:35.266 --> 00:00:36.933
Your thing is new.

14
00:00:36.933 --> 00:00:39.733
Hmm, I see you are the new one.

15
00:00:39.733 --> 00:00:41.866
Hand him over to your manager

16
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.433
Don't know anything.

17
00:00:43.566 --> 00:00:45.300
The manager did not

18
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.500
The boss is standing in front of you

19
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.066
Hahaha, you don't even understand the Buddha statue.

20
00:00:51.066 --> 00:00:53.466
What kind of boss are you?

21
00:00:53.466 --> 00:00:55.500
What is the Buddha statue looking at?

22
00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.100
Do you know how to open your face?

23
00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.800
Ah oops uncle

24
00:00:58.966 --> 00:01:01.400
Your face is also new.

25
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.433
You're sick of licking my shoes

26
00:01:03.766 --> 00:01:07.833
The truth is, what are you?

27
00:01:09.866 --> 00:01:12.200
Come on, look at this

28
00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.366
Wow, there is also a collection certificate.

29
00:01:17.466 --> 00:01:20.033
Hahaha uncle

30
00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.300
You wrote it by hand.

31
00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:23.500
You don't even have a stamp

32
00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.600
Are you kidding me? You really are

33
00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.600
I have been identified by more than a dozen experts

34
00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.800
You said it was dear?

35
00:01:30.966 --> 00:01:32.366
I'm here to take care of you

36
00:01:32.366 --> 00:01:33.900
Here's the money for you.

37
00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.633
You don't know

38
00:01:35.733 --> 00:01:37.700
Hmm uncle

39
00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.000
You can go somewhere else to have a look. Is this thing yours?

40
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.033
We don't accept

41
00:01:41.533 --> 00:01:43.766
Don't accept it, huh?

42
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.500
I took a taxi.

43
00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.833
The whole city has been transformed

44
00:01:48.133 --> 00:01:50.166
You are the last one

45
00:01:50.166 --> 00:01:51.200
Just let me go

46
00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.100
You also quoted me the taxi fare. Why?

47
00:01:54.333 --> 00:01:56.666
What does your taxi have to do with us?

48
00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.566
Why should I report the taxi fare to you? I don't report it, right?

49
00:01:59.566 --> 00:02:02.233
I won't leave if I don't report it

50
00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:03.900
You don't want to do business

51
00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.433
Hey you

52
00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:10.866
Someone hit someone

53
00:02:10.933 --> 00:02:12.700
Someone hit someone

54
00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.166
Haha, good, good, let you offend the suspect.

55
00:02:16.166 --> 00:02:17.500
Please use something nice.
