00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:01.000
Broken broken

2
00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.433
He actually knows Brother Hu

3
00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.466
If Tiger knew someone had stolen his bronze

4
00:00:05.533 --> 00:00:06.700
We're all going to die!

5
00:00:06.866 --> 00:00:08.300
What about the bridge?

6
00:00:08.966 --> 00:00:11.033
Don't worry. Don't worry.

7
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:13.100
They're all dying, and you're still being stubborn

8
00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:15.233
Brother, you really have the guts

9
00:00:15.266 --> 00:00:16.966
Even Brother Tiger dares to steal

10
00:00:16.966 --> 00:00:18.500
Do you know who Tiger is?

11
00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:20.000
Black is the boss

12
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.466
Steal his stuff and wait to die

13
00:00:22.466 --> 00:00:25.166
Which eye did you see that I stole it?

14
00:00:25.166 --> 00:00:27.866
Something like this is worth at least tens of millions

15
00:00:27.866 --> 00:00:28.900
Where did you get the money?

16
00:00:30.766 --> 00:00:32.666
Use you to pay back

17
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.166
I'll see how you explain it to Fifth Brother later.

18
00:00:40.866 --> 00:00:43.166
It's over, it's over, it's really here

19
00:00:46.466 --> 00:00:48.366
Why did you call me here in a hurry?

20
00:00:48.366 --> 00:00:51.166
You don't know that Brother Hu is very busy with sincerity, I tell you

21
00:00:51.166 --> 00:00:53.666
If you dare to say it's okay today, I'll do it

22
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.200
Hey, Brother Hu, of course I know that you have a busy day.

23
00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.200
It's okay, how can I bring you here?

24
00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:59.000
Brother Tiger

25
00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.766
I know someone stole your goods.

26
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.866
Trick or treat here

27
00:01:02.866 --> 00:01:05.300
Got caught by me?

28
00:01:05.966 --> 00:01:08.266
Who has the guts to steal my stuff?

29
00:01:08.266 --> 00:01:09.200
That's him!

30
00:01:09.733 --> 00:01:10.533
OK

31
00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.466
Hey, oops.

32
00:01:15.466 --> 00:01:16.333
Brother Tiger

33
00:01:16.333 --> 00:01:18.066
This is my brother, Brother Tiger, Brother Tiger, oh my god

34
00:01:18.066 --> 00:01:18.800
Why are you here?

35
00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.966
Long time no see, can you make my brother easy to find?
