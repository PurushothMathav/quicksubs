00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:03.633
Obedient obedient obedient

2
00:00:04.133 --> 00:00:06.200
I listen to you

3
00:00:07.066 --> 00:00:10.166
We'll meet again after that.

4
00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:12.300
Humph

5
00:00:13.166 --> 00:00:14.166
Ah!

6
00:00:24.666 --> 00:00:26.800
Bridge, you are crazy, how dare you come?

7
00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.200
This is organized by Chen Tianshi

8
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.166
If he finds out, you're dead

9
00:00:30.466 --> 00:00:31.933
What dare not

10
00:00:31.933 --> 00:00:33.466
I counted the days

11
00:00:33.466 --> 00:00:36.800
Today is the day of Chen Tianshi's death, I'm here to save him

12
00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.366
Shhh and nonsense

13
00:00:38.366 --> 00:00:40.866
Don't let others hear what you are afraid of

14
00:00:41.333 --> 00:00:42.566
There's not a lot of people here.

15
00:00:42.566 --> 00:00:45.900
Besides, what if he hears it and walks in?

16
00:00:48.133 --> 00:00:49.333
Invitation letter from the chef

17
00:00:49.333 --> 00:00:50.233
Invitation letter

18
00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:52.000
Teacher Fang

19
00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.400
I don't have it.

20
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.400
Sorry, you can't go in without an invitation

21
00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.233
I yo yo yo

22
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:00.866
Isn't this a bridge?

23
00:01:00.866 --> 00:01:03.866
Why can't I even get into class? Isn't this Huang Xiang?

24
00:01:03.966 --> 00:01:05.300
What about your brother?

25
00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:07.166
I really forgot if you didn't say it.

26
00:01:07.166 --> 00:01:09.900
It was you who picked out my brother's shrimp line

27
00:01:10.366 --> 00:01:12.200
So what if I was?

28
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.200
What to pack

29
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.566
Now everyone knows that you have offended Angel Chen.

30
00:01:15.566 --> 00:01:18.300
You are now a rat crossing the street, everyone is shouting and beating

31
00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.000
If I tell Chen Tianshi

32
00:01:20.333 --> 00:01:21.800
Come and cut you into eight pieces

33
00:01:21.866 --> 00:01:24.766
Huang Xiang didn't expect that Xiang wasn't in your head

34
00:01:24.766 --> 00:01:25.900
Pretty smart

35
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:26.900
What nonsense

36
00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:30.700
Come and throw it into the river and feed it to the fish. What are you doing?

37
00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:31.500
let go

38
00:01:32.366 --> 00:01:33.466
Uh-huh.

39
00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.233
Hahaha hey
