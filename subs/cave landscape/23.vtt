00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:00.966
Is that you?

2
00:00:00.966 --> 00:00:03.600
I heard that you were banned by Chen Tianshi yesterday

3
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.466
Now the entire antique world of Hangcheng is banning you

4
00:00:06.466 --> 00:00:08.266
How dare someone take you in?

5
00:00:08.266 --> 00:00:10.366
Boss Wang, how dare you?

6
00:00:10.366 --> 00:00:12.733
Chen Tianshi just said not to let me trade

7
00:00:12.733 --> 00:00:14.566
He didn't say I wasn't allowed to do chores

8
00:00:15.133 --> 00:00:16.500
I work here. What's wrong?

9
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:17.800
Stop talking here

10
00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:18.933
It has nothing to do with you today.

11
00:00:18.933 --> 00:00:20.366
I'm here to get the money today.

12
00:00:20.366 --> 00:00:21.666
Give me the money now

13
00:00:21.666 --> 00:00:23.866
No money no money

14
00:00:24.766 --> 00:00:26.400
No money to say

15
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:29.233
Nice bottle

16
00:00:30.533 --> 00:00:32.233
Hey what are you doing

17
00:00:32.566 --> 00:00:34.033
Teacher Wang, are you alright?

18
00:00:34.333 --> 00:00:36.333
Is it okay to have no money?

19
00:00:36.333 --> 00:00:38.533
Then this shop will be given to me

20
00:00:38.533 --> 00:00:40.533
Now this shop is mine

21
00:00:40.533 --> 00:00:42.666
The things inside are naturally mine

22
00:00:42.666 --> 00:00:45.700
Master, if I want to smash you, I will smash you

23
00:00:47.566 --> 00:00:49.966
I'd love to. Um, how much do you owe?

24
00:00:49.966 --> 00:00:51.400
I'm not here yet

25
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:52.233
also

26
00:00:52.866 --> 00:00:55.233
20 million oops

27
00:00:55.566 --> 00:00:57.100
How much do I pay?

28
00:00:57.166 --> 00:00:58.633
Isn't it just 20 million?

29
00:00:58.666 --> 00:01:00.466
My celestial teacher came down the mountain

30
00:01:00.533 --> 00:01:03.000
Selling you 200 million is a top deal

31
00:01:03.466 --> 00:01:05.500
200 million, what do you think?

32
00:01:05.533 --> 00:01:07.333
Now the whole voyage knows

33
00:01:07.333 --> 00:01:09.566
You were banned by Chen Tianshi

34
00:01:09.733 --> 00:01:11.400
Who dares to bury your stuff?

35
00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.900
Just your broken china vase

36
00:01:13.133 --> 00:01:15.700
Go back and shit yourself

37
00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.133
Isn't it Chen Tianshi?

38
00:01:17.133 --> 00:01:18.933
Can't I just talk to him tomorrow?

39
00:01:18.933 --> 00:01:20.000
Who do you think you are?

40
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.066
Is Chen Tianshi someone you can meet if you want?

41
00:01:22.066 --> 00:01:24.100
Ah, to tell you the truth

42
00:01:24.133 --> 00:01:26.633
Chen Tianshi is preparing for the baseball contest in three days

43
00:01:27.333 --> 00:01:30.066
It's impossible to quit rubbish like you

44
00:01:30.333 --> 00:01:31.466
Give me three days.

45
00:01:31.466 --> 00:01:34.500
Let Lao Tzu wait for you for three days, and you also deserve one day.

46
00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.666
Grandson, do you dare to give me a day?

47
00:01:37.666 --> 00:01:40.000
I promise I'll give you the money tomorrow.

48
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.300
If you can't give it to us, you can handle it.

49
00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:44.166
Bridge, what nonsense are you talking about?

50
00:01:44.166 --> 00:01:45.533
Are you trying to get us killed?

51
00:01:45.533 --> 00:01:48.000
Good day just one day

52
00:01:48.166 --> 00:01:50.700
I will continue to help you at the same time tomorrow.

53
00:01:50.933 --> 00:01:52.466
If I don't see the money

54
00:01:52.466 --> 00:01:54.833
Then I'll give you this store.

55
00:01:55.566 --> 00:01:56.366
receive

56
00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.200
Bridge you are crazy for a day

57
00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.866
How can you raise money in one day?

58
00:02:02.266 --> 00:02:03.533
Broom star every time

59
00:02:03.533 --> 00:02:04.533
It's not good to meet you

60
00:02:04.533 --> 00:02:06.800
I think you did it on purpose. Don't worry.

61
00:02:07.966 --> 00:02:09.400
I have my own way
