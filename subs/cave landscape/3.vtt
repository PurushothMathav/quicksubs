00:00:03.366 --> 00:00:04.300
What!

2
00:00:04.733 --> 00:00:07.433
I didn't expect Teacher Feng to be the character sister

3
00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:09.366
No wonder I play with my phone in the morning

4
00:00:09.366 --> 00:00:10.566
He looks so weird.

5
00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:13.500
Let me try.

6
00:00:16.733 --> 00:00:19.066
What are you doing in broad daylight?

7
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:28.366
Who are you?

8
00:00:30.133 --> 00:00:32.266
Don't know who I am

9
00:00:32.266 --> 00:00:33.666
It doesn't matter who I am

10
00:00:33.866 --> 00:00:36.000
The important thing is that I have your secret

11
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.633
What do you say?

12
00:00:38.966 --> 00:00:41.900
Since you found out, I will hide myself

13
00:00:42.566 --> 00:00:43.800
It's one of your lonely eyes

14
00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:44.700
I want to find someone

15
00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:47.466
Please don't tell anyone

16
00:00:47.466 --> 00:00:48.766
I will listen to you from now on

17
00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:50.633
Hahahaha

18
00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:53.000
Listen to me from now on

19
00:00:53.533 --> 00:00:56.200
I'll try changing clothes.

20
00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.466
Take two sexy pictures of me.

21
00:01:14.333 --> 00:01:15.233
Are you satisfied?

22
00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:19.866
A few more

23
00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:21.866
Something bigger.

24
00:01:21.866 --> 00:01:24.966
No, that's it for today, next time

25
00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.400
Unexpectedly, the cold-looking teacher Feng

26
00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.300
So wild inside

27
00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.066
Really exciting

28
00:01:32.066 --> 00:01:34.300
You old thing, how dare you lie to me?

29
00:01:34.866 --> 00:01:36.566
Where did you lie? Do you have any evidence?

30
00:01:36.566 --> 00:01:39.966
He obviously lied to me

31
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.000
You're a liar!

32
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.700
I just saw that ball clearly in this bowl.

33
00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.200
It's gone when you open it.

34
00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:46.133
Give me my money back

35
00:01:46.133 --> 00:01:49.000
Bah, I told you to admit defeat

36
00:01:49.266 --> 00:01:50.500
Go by yourself

37
00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.000
Who do you blame? You! By the way, you dare to yell at me?

38
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:53.833
Give it here.

39
00:01:55.133 --> 00:01:56.400
Hey.

40
00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:58.866
You think I'm nobody?

41
00:01:58.866 --> 00:02:01.033
Hahaha how about it?

42
00:02:01.733 --> 00:02:02.533
Hey

43
00:02:09.566 --> 00:02:11.233
Sun Yang, what are you doing?

44
00:02:11.333 --> 00:02:13.200
Xiao Yang, you got it just right?

45
00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.900
This liar cheated me out of ten thousand dollars

46
00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.900
Come with us, oops.

47
00:02:17.066 --> 00:02:18.266
Don't be ashamed.

48
00:02:18.266 --> 00:02:19.066
willing to admit defeat

49
00:02:19.366 --> 00:02:21.600
At most, if you lose, I will keep it for you.

50
00:02:21.766 --> 00:02:23.166
Haha, that's right.

51
00:02:23.366 --> 00:02:24.500
Bet one to ten

52
00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:25.766
How much do you bet?

53
00:02:27.166 --> 00:02:27.966
Hey

54
00:02:28.466 --> 00:02:29.266
Hey

55
00:02:29.966 --> 00:02:31.566
Hey, leave it here
