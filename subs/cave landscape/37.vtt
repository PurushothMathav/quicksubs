00:00:07.333 --> 00:00:08.666
Ah!

2
00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:10.900
Are there really mermaids?

3
00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.266
It's so pretty.

4
00:00:19.533 --> 00:00:23.100
It's a miracle of the creator

5
00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:29.400
You are the one who set me free

6
00:00:30.333 --> 00:00:33.400
Then you are mine

7
00:00:33.966 --> 00:00:34.833
beauty

8
00:00:35.366 --> 00:00:36.633
Mermaid

9
00:00:37.766 --> 00:00:38.833
How is that possible?

10
00:00:43.166 --> 00:00:45.966
I thought it was just a myth

11
00:00:45.966 --> 00:00:48.266
I didn't expect it to really exist.

12
00:00:48.366 --> 00:00:51.266
Chen Tianshi, look at Chen Tianshi

13
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:55.933
Is it really because of this?

14
00:00:55.933 --> 00:00:58.600
In fact, if you feel unwell these two days

15
00:00:58.666 --> 00:01:00.600
Make sure to break that wrench for him

16
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.000
It might save your life

17
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.700
Yeah.

18
00:01:09.733 --> 00:01:11.700
Chen Tianshi, are you alright?

19
00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.433
I just passed out.

20
00:01:16.366 --> 00:01:19.433
Hurry up and invite the bridge over

21
00:01:19.466 --> 00:01:21.633
Yeah, gross

22
00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:23.600
You don't belong here.

23
00:01:23.766 --> 00:01:25.166
I'm going to put you back in the ocean.

24
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.033
No, I don't agree.

25
00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.166
I have signed it, you don't want it.

26
00:01:29.166 --> 00:01:31.400
I'm leaving. Come home with me.

27
00:01:33.666 --> 00:01:35.300
I drove the mermaid

28
00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:36.900
It's not up to you to deal with it

29
00:01:37.366 --> 00:01:38.600
You lose.

30
00:01:38.766 --> 00:01:40.266
Who said we lost?

31
00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.866
Who made our bet just now?

32
00:01:42.866 --> 00:01:44.366
Who wins the big clam bead?

33
00:01:45.366 --> 00:01:48.700
This thing is helping him, isn't it?

34
00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:49.966
So say

35
00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:51.600
Or did we win?

36
00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.033
Hey you cheated

37
00:01:53.733 --> 00:01:55.100
Home

38
00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.800
The heavier the wind and waves, the more expensive the rain, do you understand?

39
00:01:57.933 --> 00:01:59.166
There's no wind.

40
00:01:59.166 --> 00:02:00.333
Where did the waves come from?

41
00:02:00.333 --> 00:02:02.000
Rules are rules

42
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.500
So we won.

43
00:02:04.866 --> 00:02:06.333
Well, give me the money.

44
00:02:06.333 --> 00:02:07.433
willing to admit defeat

45
00:02:07.566 --> 00:02:10.366
What money is open of course 10 million

46
00:02:10.366 --> 00:02:12.666
Humph 10 million

47
00:02:13.366 --> 00:02:15.266
No, if not.

48
00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.933
Just take the mermaid for fun?

49
00:02:18.933 --> 00:02:21.366
Somebody do it.

50
00:02:21.733 --> 00:02:23.266
What are you doing stop

51
00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:26.900
Stop me
