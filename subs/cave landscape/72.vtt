00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:02.666
Since you want to die, I can't save you, so I'll help you.

2
00:00:02.666 --> 00:00:05.566
This is the last time I will take you to the dinner party. Thank you

3
00:00:09.166 --> 00:00:11.400
Why don't you listen to advice? I'm pissed off.

4
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:12.600
The Last Time

5
00:00:13.166 --> 00:00:14.400
Pardon me?

6
00:00:14.566 --> 00:00:18.566
I said this is the last time I'll text you

7
00:00:19.266 --> 00:00:21.633
You are me

8
00:00:21.666 --> 00:00:24.133
The mysterious person who has been in touch with you for a short time

9
00:00:24.133 --> 00:00:26.900
I've always known who you are

10
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.300
What are you saying?

11
00:00:28.333 --> 00:00:30.033
I don't understand hum

12
00:00:30.333 --> 00:00:31.466
Don't believe it?

13
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.166
You have a mole on your chest.

14
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.833
A red birthmark on his waist

15
00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:40.633
And your thighs, stop talking

16
00:00:41.666 --> 00:00:43.200
How did you find out?

17
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.666
That was the day I got fired.

18
00:00:45.666 --> 00:00:47.266
I just wanted to try

19
00:00:47.266 --> 00:00:50.466
I didn't expect our teacher Feng to be so open

20
00:00:50.533 --> 00:00:51.766
Give what you want

21
00:00:51.766 --> 00:00:53.466
I'm not that kind of person

22
00:00:53.966 --> 00:00:56.366
I'm just a little depressed

23
00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.400
I want to release it

24
00:00:58.733 --> 00:01:00.900
I have seen the other side of you

25
00:01:00.933 --> 00:01:02.900
Don't hit that

26
00:01:03.666 --> 00:01:04.900
Will you dislike me?

27
00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:05.900
Yes.

28
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.300
Love you more

29
00:01:09.466 --> 00:01:13.100
Really? Then I'll be yours from now on.

30
00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.866
Okay, then I'm back from the party this time

31
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.166
You have to compensate me well.

32
00:01:19.533 --> 00:01:20.766
You little guy
