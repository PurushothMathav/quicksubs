00:00:07.933 --> 00:00:09.866
Bridge, where have you been?

2
00:00:09.866 --> 00:00:11.133
It's been almost a day and I'm nowhere to be seen

3
00:00:11.133 --> 00:00:13.666
He must have gone back early to pack his things.

4
00:00:13.733 --> 00:00:15.766
This store is going to be out of stock, and it will leave in advance.

5
00:00:15.766 --> 00:00:17.566
Although I raised money

6
00:00:17.566 --> 00:00:19.666
Where did you get it?

7
00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:27.300
Sengoku bronzes

8
00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:30.066
Where are you from?

9
00:00:30.066 --> 00:00:30.900
Let it go.

10
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.466
This line is enough to exchange back to our store.

11
00:00:34.933 --> 00:00:36.200
That's fine.

12
00:00:36.533 --> 00:00:39.600
With this, our store will definitely be fine, haha.

13
00:00:43.166 --> 00:00:44.400
Bridge you are amazing

14
00:00:46.466 --> 00:00:47.700
Boss Wang

15
00:00:56.733 --> 00:00:58.700
Collection today?

16
00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:00.500
If I don't see the money yet

17
00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.866
I'll take everything from your store

18
00:01:02.866 --> 00:01:06.200
I smashed them one by one

19
00:01:06.266 --> 00:01:08.866
Then I burned it all on fire

20
00:01:08.866 --> 00:01:10.166
Money not raised

21
00:01:10.333 --> 00:01:12.533
But I can pay off my debt with something

22
00:01:12.533 --> 00:01:13.333
debt repayment

23
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.900
Haha, are you mistaken?

24
00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.900
Just the crap in your shitty store

25
00:01:17.933 --> 00:01:18.766
Do you have enough money?

26
00:01:18.766 --> 00:01:21.666
He doesn't count enough if you add your town store treasure

27
00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.966
Pay off the debt, what do you get to pay off the debt?

28
00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.200
Fang Shao

29
00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:36.033
Is this thing real? It looks real

30
00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.400
Ammonia without acid

31
00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:40.700
It's not like making wine manually

32
00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.133
That must be worth a lot of money.

33
00:01:42.133 --> 00:01:43.500
At least 50 million

34
00:01:44.066 --> 00:01:46.066
What? I don't make a lot of money.

35
00:01:46.166 --> 00:01:48.166
This newly unearthed bronze

36
00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:49.866
Where did you find it?

37
00:01:49.933 --> 00:01:52.500
Hmph, I bought it on the black market, the black market

38
00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:54.000
Hahahaha

39
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.466
Do you know what you're talking about?

40
00:01:56.466 --> 00:01:58.933
What about the black market for things like this?

41
00:01:58.933 --> 00:02:01.666
Looking at the entire Hangcheng, only Brother Tiger has it

42
00:02:01.666 --> 00:02:05.300
So Boss Hong, this is fake.

43
00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.100
Go find someone to test, and the test will be over.

44
00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:09.966
Unknown thing

45
00:02:09.966 --> 00:02:11.000
Tell the truth

46
00:02:11.133 --> 00:02:11.966
What about the little demon network?

47
00:02:11.966 --> 00:02:13.233
Just met

48
00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.866
Go and invite Brother Tiger over
