00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:04.300
What a cocky boy

2
00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:06.600
Angel, do you need me to throw him out?

3
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.266
Don't look at it first

4
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:10.266
Bridge haha

5
00:00:10.266 --> 00:00:12.333
Don't think you've had a few bad luck

6
00:00:12.333 --> 00:00:13.500
I saw a few decent things

7
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.533
You think of yourself as a treasure appraiser

8
00:00:15.533 --> 00:00:18.966
This stick is different from that thing

9
00:00:19.266 --> 00:00:21.700
What if I open the Overlord today?

10
00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:23.800
You still drive out the Overlord

11
00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.200
If you can get rid of the Overlord

12
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.166
The two of us will open a shop for you reasonably

13
00:00:27.166 --> 00:00:28.500
When you are black

14
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.000
How about the two of us cutting the ribbon for you ourselves?

15
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.033
Ah no yeah

16
00:00:33.466 --> 00:00:34.633
It's a deal.

17
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.366
Can you handle the bridge?

18
00:00:36.366 --> 00:00:38.200
Then Fang Yuan's family is fishing for sea goods

19
00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:39.900
Growing up in the clam river

20
00:00:40.133 --> 00:00:41.800
Don't worry, no problem.

21
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.533
Fang Yuan, I'll let you choose first

22
00:00:44.533 --> 00:00:47.400
Hahaha, you let me choose first.

23
00:00:47.666 --> 00:00:49.700
Do you really not know my ability?

24
00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:50.733
You let me choose first

25
00:00:50.733 --> 00:00:53.166
You just have no chance of winning

26
00:00:53.166 --> 00:00:54.266
Let you choose, you choose

27
00:00:54.266 --> 00:00:55.633
Where did you get so much nonsense?

28
00:01:05.166 --> 00:01:06.233
Just him.

29
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:09.966
Look at me.

30
00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.666
Okay. Reach out!

31
00:01:12.666 --> 00:01:14.366
Really twice

32
00:01:26.266 --> 00:01:28.100
This is the Overlord

33
00:01:28.166 --> 00:01:29.600
What a big one!

34
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.333
The bridge is your turn.

35
00:01:33.333 --> 00:01:35.200
As expected of a vacationer

36
00:01:35.266 --> 00:01:36.700
Your eyesight is really poisonous

37
00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.966
Sure enough, you can see this king at a glance

38
00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.133
He lost the bridge.

39
00:01:42.133 --> 00:01:44.600
Send someone to chase him away

40
00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.600
Get me the bridge downstairs

41
00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.166
Xiao Liang, how are you grinding?

42
00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:53.633
Like a pussy

43
00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:55.766
Don't you dare?

44
00:01:55.766 --> 00:01:59.033
Admit defeat now and let you go

45
00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:21.566
Here he is.
