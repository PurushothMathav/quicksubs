00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.600
Wow, it's a purple glass window

2
00:00:07.666 --> 00:00:09.666
I'm going to get rich, look at you

3
00:00:09.666 --> 00:00:11.066
I don't even know what to say about you

4
00:00:11.066 --> 00:00:11.900
This is what you said.

5
00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:13.466
Then I'm welcome.

6
00:00:13.466 --> 00:00:14.633
I choose first

7
00:00:16.133 --> 00:00:18.833
Well, I'll take them all.

8
00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:20.300
What!

9
00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:22.833
What do you mean?

10
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.000
You take all these obviously shipped stones.

11
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.466
So what else do we buy?

12
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:28.466
Broken

13
00:00:28.666 --> 00:00:30.966
You don't have a rule that I can't buy it all, right?

14
00:00:30.966 --> 00:00:31.800
As long as I have money

15
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.200
I can have as many as I want.

16
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.033
Even if I empty this store

17
00:00:35.066 --> 00:00:36.600
What can you do to me boss

18
00:00:36.866 --> 00:00:38.400
No matter how much he pays

19
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:39.633
I pay double

20
00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:40.500
Humph

21
00:00:41.366 --> 00:00:42.966
Uh, not Miss Chen.

22
00:00:42.966 --> 00:00:44.566
Aren't you embarrassing me?

23
00:00:45.566 --> 00:00:46.866
I'll scold you like that

24
00:00:46.866 --> 00:00:48.500
Then my name stinks

25
00:00:48.933 --> 00:00:50.133
Since you want the kite

26
00:00:50.133 --> 00:00:51.666
Then I have to sell it to him.

27
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.400
I don't just want it all

28
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.100
I'm going to make an incision on the spot.

29
00:00:55.166 --> 00:00:56.833
Let some people's dream of opening a store

30
00:00:57.266 --> 00:01:00.000
Let him see with his own eyes how it breaks

31
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.566
Somebody cut it

32
00:01:11.333 --> 00:01:14.000
Wow, as expected of Master Fang

33
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.300
Sure enough, I understood

34
00:01:15.466 --> 00:01:17.433
Every piece you see is a boutique.

35
00:01:17.666 --> 00:01:18.600
Estimate

36
00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.933
I made at least 100 million, oops, where is it?

37
00:01:21.933 --> 00:01:23.666
These are small cases.

38
00:01:23.666 --> 00:01:24.500
How about trabecular

39
00:01:24.933 --> 00:01:26.233
Let you choose

40
00:01:26.966 --> 00:01:30.766
Great, he didn't open the purple glass seed.

41
00:01:31.166 --> 00:01:32.400
Choose your uncle

42
00:01:32.566 --> 00:01:33.666
Xiao Liang let's go

43
00:01:33.866 --> 00:01:36.800
I don't believe it's not sold elsewhere. Let's go.

44
00:01:37.733 --> 00:01:38.666
Master Fang

45
00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:42.066
Since you have opened all these jade stones

46
00:01:42.066 --> 00:01:45.400
Can you keep the leftovers for me?

47
00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.100
That rubbish

48
00:01:50.466 --> 00:01:53.400
Do you really want that junk?

49
00:01:53.733 --> 00:01:55.066
Why are you crazy?

50
00:01:55.066 --> 00:01:56.700
What do you want that rubbish for?

51
00:01:57.066 --> 00:01:57.700
Right.

52
00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:00.666
I've never seen anyone pick up trash before

53
00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.466
Master Fang, do you give it?
