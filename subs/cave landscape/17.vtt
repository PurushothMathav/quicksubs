00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.000
Master, would you please announce it?

2
00:00:08.866 --> 00:00:10.866
I solemnly declare

3
00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.800
Hangzhou National Treasure is a bridge

4
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:15.366
Tianshi descends the mountain

5
00:00:21.066 --> 00:00:24.400
I didn't expect Master Bai and I to be wrong

6
00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:25.966
Almost let that national treasure

7
00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.433
Let him never envy the world

8
00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:32.266
I'm not feeling well on the bridge, I'll go first

9
00:00:32.333 --> 00:00:33.233
I accompany you

10
00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.066
No, the national treasure is mine

11
00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.500
The rice bucket is mine

12
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:38.600
Don't look at my teacher

13
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.433
I'm not a vegetarian

14
00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.633
Impudent Master Bai is here

15
00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:45.600
Are you wiping your eyes here?

16
00:00:46.366 --> 00:00:48.400
You are still talking

17
00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:51.033
If it weren't for you, I wouldn't be wrong at all

18
00:00:51.133 --> 00:00:52.733
What are you pretending to do?

19
00:00:52.733 --> 00:00:54.166
Just a lie

20
00:00:54.166 --> 00:00:56.300
You can't even tell the difference between the dirt and the side

21
00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:57.733
Pardon me?

22
00:00:57.733 --> 00:00:59.900
Give you a chance, you are useless?

23
00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:03.166
What's the matter, this bottle is worth the money now

24
00:01:03.166 --> 00:01:06.000
Do you want to go back to your spring and autumn dreams?

25
00:01:06.666 --> 00:01:07.633
willing to admit defeat

26
00:01:08.066 --> 00:01:09.333
Kneel down and call Daddy

27
00:01:09.333 --> 00:01:10.900
You made me kneel down and call me daddy

28
00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:12.200
Do you know who my father is?

29
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.400
You look down on

30
00:01:13.533 --> 00:01:15.466
The emperor is a famous family

31
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.766
His father was a statesman on the voyage.

32
00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.466
Let him go

33
00:01:20.566 --> 00:01:23.266
He's not something you can burn fat with.

34
00:01:24.333 --> 00:01:25.866
Almost left you behind

35
00:01:25.866 --> 00:01:27.900
And you just kneel down together

36
00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:28.900
You also deserve

37
00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:30.966
Bridge forget it

38
00:01:30.966 --> 00:01:32.500
The family background of the two of them

39
00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:33.733
Not something you can afford to mess with

40
00:01:33.733 --> 00:01:36.000
Let's go. Get on your knees
