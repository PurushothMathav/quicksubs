00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.800
You see it

2
00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:02.766
Not bad. Not bad.

3
00:00:02.766 --> 00:00:05.600
When this kid first brought the dung bucket up

4
00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:07.400
I thought it was a mess.

5
00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:10.200
I didn't expect it to burn down

6
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.400
The porcelain vase came out

7
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:12.766
What a genius

8
00:00:12.766 --> 00:00:14.666
It's rare for you to go public like this.

9
00:00:14.666 --> 00:00:15.866
Let me see.

10
00:00:15.866 --> 00:00:18.800
Young man, move forward.

11
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.166
Hurry up

12
00:00:20.733 --> 00:00:22.766
Nice boy

13
00:00:23.666 --> 00:00:27.900
As if a golden light is pouring down from your celestial cover

14
00:00:27.933 --> 00:00:31.633
It's a rare treasure appraisal genius in a hundred years

15
00:00:31.766 --> 00:00:33.933
But you have to be careful

16
00:00:33.933 --> 00:00:36.966
This porcelain pot will spell disaster for you

17
00:00:36.966 --> 00:00:38.633
What so-called

18
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.300
Innocence

19
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:41.900
guilty

20
00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.066
You have such a national treasure

21
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.266
I'm afraid someone will miss you

22
00:00:46.266 --> 00:00:47.766
You are in danger

23
00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:51.033
But I can help you

24
00:00:51.066 --> 00:00:53.000
Be a disciple of the old man

25
00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.400
No one dares to bully you

26
00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.200
Chen Tianshi, do you want to accept apprentices?

27
00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:03.300
A talented young man like the old lady fell like this

28
00:01:03.333 --> 00:01:05.000
Be my only disciple

29
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.800
I guarantee you the rules of the gatekeeper.

30
00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.766
You still have to abide by the sect rules

31
00:01:12.766 --> 00:01:14.800
Bridge, hurry up and agree!

32
00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:18.000
It sounds like this old man has a lot of rules

33
00:01:18.566 --> 00:01:19.366
I have divine eyes

34
00:01:19.366 --> 00:01:21.066
I will definitely have continuous financial resources in the future

35
00:01:21.066 --> 00:01:22.433
Woman, I also have a Buddhist god

36
00:01:22.566 --> 00:01:24.700
The gods can't envy such a day

37
00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.266
I don't want to rely on others

38
00:01:26.666 --> 00:01:27.700
Sorry angel

39
00:01:28.333 --> 00:01:30.100
I don't think so.

40
00:01:30.733 --> 00:01:32.633
Bridge you are crazy

41
00:01:33.066 --> 00:01:34.766
Did you know that such an opportunity

42
00:01:34.766 --> 00:01:36.566
How many people can't ask

43
00:01:36.566 --> 00:01:38.066
You refused

44
00:01:38.466 --> 00:01:39.666
Thank you angel for your kindness

45
00:01:39.666 --> 00:01:42.466
But the disciples still want to stand on their own

46
00:01:44.266 --> 00:01:47.566
Wake up since you didn't mean it

47
00:01:47.566 --> 00:01:49.900
Even if the old man is affectionate

48
00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:51.000
There you go.

49
00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:53.200
Come on.

50
00:01:55.466 --> 00:01:56.266
