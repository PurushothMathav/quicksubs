1
00:00:00.466 --> 00:00:02.400
I said why is it so smelly?

2
00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:03.600
Why are you here?

3
00:00:03.866 --> 00:00:04.966
What the hell?

4
00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.300
I'm here to participate in the national treasure conference hahaha

5
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.433
You come to the National Treasure Conference

6
00:00:11.566 --> 00:00:12.800
Is the recovery good?

7
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.933
Look, there's so much blood, it's nothing

8
00:00:14.933 --> 00:00:16.900
It seems that I still started lightly

9
00:00:20.466 --> 00:00:22.366
Hmph, I have to thank Young Master Fang

10
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.566
Otherwise I will attack too

11
00:00:25.733 --> 00:00:26.966
So many people.

12
00:00:26.966 --> 00:00:28.466
It's a big row.

13
00:00:28.466 --> 00:00:30.266
Come to the table

14
00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.333
Ha ha.

15
00:00:41.333 --> 00:00:42.866
Everyone is here

16
00:00:42.866 --> 00:00:45.733
It seems that I know that I am going to take the national treasure of Haocheng

17
00:00:45.733 --> 00:00:47.500
Come and celebrate for me in advance.

18
00:00:47.566 --> 00:00:49.266
Thank you. Thank you.

19
00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:51.000
later

20
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.166
Master Huang, your tone is so loud

21
00:00:53.166 --> 00:00:55.500
It's a celebration before the game even starts

22
00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.266
Grow up with me

23
00:00:57.666 --> 00:00:59.066
You can't win

24
00:01:01.066 --> 00:01:02.200
Is it you?

25
00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.066
How do you know each other?

26
00:01:04.066 --> 00:01:06.800
This brat tricked me into buying a dung bucket yesterday

27
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.866
It turns out that you are the one who spent 500,000 buying the dung bucket?

28
00:01:09.866 --> 00:01:11.966
No wonder your name is Huang Xiang

29
00:01:11.966 --> 00:01:14.500
Oh, Master Huang, don't worry.

30
00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:15.966
You didn't suffer either.

31
00:01:15.966 --> 00:01:16.766
So I heard.

32
00:01:16.766 --> 00:01:19.266
Yesterday, someone poured night pearls into your dung bucket.

33
00:01:19.266 --> 00:01:20.666
You make a lot of money

34
00:01:20.733 --> 00:01:23.366
Hey, tell my brother who that fool is?

35
00:01:23.866 --> 00:01:27.300
Hahahaha, no wonder.

36
00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:28.600
Look at the entire trip

37
00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:29.866
Only this fool can

38
00:01:29.866 --> 00:01:31.966
What a big fool would do

39
00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.833
The stupid soil of the night pearl is worth a word

40
00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:38.100
Hey, a bunch of people who don't know the goods

41
00:01:38.866 --> 00:01:41.366
Qiangliang, I should actually thank you

42
00:01:41.366 --> 00:01:42.500
If not for you

43
00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.733
How did I get such a good night pearl?

44
00:01:44.733 --> 00:01:47.400
So as to win the title of Tangcheng National Treasure?

45
00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.566
Hey Master Wang, you are so loud

46
00:01:50.566 --> 00:01:51.600
One person is not talented

47
00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:52.400
I had to tell him.

48
00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.900
I have already obtained the heirloom of the Feng family

49
00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.200
So you can't win

50
00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.600
Wow, that's amazing.

51
00:01:59.733 --> 00:02:01.500
Boss Feng has confirmed it for you.

52
00:02:01.533 --> 00:02:03.266
If I had heard the news yesterday

53
00:02:03.266 --> 00:02:04.666
Maybe reject you three times

54
00:02:04.866 --> 00:02:07.900
But I now have the night pearl in hand

55
00:02:07.966 --> 00:02:09.500
I am not afraid of anyone

56
00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.866
Too bad any of you have

57
00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.966
My baby is the national treasure of the voyage

58
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.766
What could it be that dung bucket?

59
00:02:19.566 --> 00:02:20.966
I guess you're right.
