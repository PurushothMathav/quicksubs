00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.400
That's why you ask someone to trouble him?

4
00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.533

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:40.466
Call your father

18
00:00:40.466 --> 00:00:43.700
I'm going to teach you a good lesson for your father, boy

19
00:00:43.733 --> 00:00:45.666
Is it for sale at this price?

20
00:00:46.066 --> 00:00:47.166
Do you know how old I am?

21
00:00:47.166 --> 00:00:49.000
I'm 80.

22
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.633

24
00:00:56.366 --> 00:00:58.166
If you say he is fake, he is fake.

25
00:00:58.166 --> 00:00:59.800
Don't tell me it's useless.

26
00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.933
You want to sell it, bring it in for me.

27
00:01:01.933 --> 00:01:02.600
I got it for you.

28
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.033
If you don't sell it, take something and go to you, you, you.

29
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.166
You insult me

30

00:01:18.133 --> 00:01:19.533
Our store has to close before it opens.

Absolutely not.

36
00:01:20.766 --> 00:01:22.666
Ignore him, he's pretending here

37
00:01:25.166 --> 00:01:28.066
Hahahahaha

38
00:01:28.066 --> 00:01:32.066
This young man can make the uncle angry to death

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.966
What a hero

40
00:01:33.966 --> 00:01:36.700
