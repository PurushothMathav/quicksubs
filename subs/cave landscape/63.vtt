00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:01.066
Who dares

2
00:00:02.366 --> 00:00:04.766
Brother Tiger, let me tell you the truth

3
00:00:04.766 --> 00:00:07.000
Today I am here for Master Qin

4
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.933
This kid offended Master Qin

5
00:00:08.933 --> 00:00:10.300
I'll talk to him

6
00:00:11.333 --> 00:00:13.600
Master Qin, are you afraid?

7
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.866
Master Qin talks to him about business, this kid is so good

8
00:00:17.066 --> 00:00:19.066
I went up and belittled one for Master Qin

9
00:00:19.133 --> 00:00:20.700
Lord Qin's dinner is coming soon

10
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:22.966
Do you think he can still mix?

11
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.466
His dinner party

12
00:00:24.466 --> 00:00:27.300
Lord Qin's dinner party is specially set for New Year's Eve

13
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.766
Isn't it just for good luck?

14
00:00:28.766 --> 00:00:30.100
This kid is good

15
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.866
He gave Master Qin's wife a slap in the face

16
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:33.933
Do you say heaven can do it?

17
00:00:33.933 --> 00:00:36.800
Song Qing, I'm not afraid if I dare to fight

18
00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.533
Don't think you can move Qin Ye out

19
00:00:38.533 --> 00:00:39.866
I can't do anything to you

20
00:00:39.866 --> 00:00:42.066
Brother Tiger, I will teach you a good lesson

21
00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.400
It's on me.

22
00:00:46.466 --> 00:00:48.266
Ok hey

23
00:00:48.566 --> 00:00:51.266
Drag him out for me to dry him out of the wind and rain

24
00:00:51.266 --> 00:00:53.800
My dear, my dear, my dear, I

25
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.033
Get out of here and kill me!

26
00:00:56.066 --> 00:00:56.866
Fuck him for me

27
00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.633
Bridge, why don't we hide first?

28
00:01:00.133 --> 00:01:03.633
No, I have the best china in the whole world.

29
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:04.966
Don't be afraid.

30
00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.100
Brother Hu, did you bring my stuff?

31
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.566
Brought someone

32
00:01:13.733 --> 00:01:14.700
Take a look.

33
00:01:15.666 --> 00:01:18.366
But I've never seen this kind of china before.

34
00:01:18.366 --> 00:01:21.400
Can it work? Why is this broken?

35
00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.500
That's right.

36
00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.366
Brother Hu, please help me make more.

37
00:01:28.066 --> 00:01:31.166
Ok I don't know what you want

38
00:01:31.533 --> 00:01:32.133
No.

39
00:01:32.133 --> 00:01:35.000
It's New Year's Eve, you can make a broken porcelain and go to the new master.

40
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.066
You are courting death

41
00:01:36.066 --> 00:01:37.433
Don't worry.

42
00:01:40.766 --> 00:01:41.566
Hello

43
00:01:45.333 --> 00:01:46.200
OK

44
00:01:47.066 --> 00:01:50.000
What's the matter? I have to go home. Something's wrong.
