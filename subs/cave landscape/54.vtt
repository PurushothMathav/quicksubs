00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:02.166
Hey, Xiao Liang

2
00:00:02.166 --> 00:00:03.700
Master Bai

3
00:00:04.566 --> 00:00:06.366
What kind of shitty place is this?

4
00:00:06.766 --> 00:00:09.300
This is, let me introduce you

5
00:00:09.333 --> 00:00:10.966
This is Mrs. Qin

6
00:00:10.966 --> 00:00:12.533
It was specially arranged by Chen Tianshi

7
00:00:12.533 --> 00:00:14.000
Have business to talk about

8
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.566
Business what business

9
00:00:15.566 --> 00:00:17.000
He is the wife of the company

10
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.966
You just need to cooperate with him

11
00:00:18.966 --> 00:00:21.533
No one will trouble you in the future

12
00:00:21.533 --> 00:00:22.600
Great bridge

13
00:00:22.866 --> 00:00:24.900
Can the royal family agree?

14
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.800
Of course the royal family is not happy

15
00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.533
But this was arranged by Angel Chen

16
00:00:28.533 --> 00:00:30.866
He didn't dare to say anything

17
00:00:30.966 --> 00:00:33.466
This place is disgusting

18
00:00:33.466 --> 00:00:34.766
It's a pigsty

19
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.200
I said I don't want to work with anyone else

20
00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.166
I still want to take the test myself

21
00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:44.666
Let's talk first

22
00:00:44.666 --> 00:00:47.000
Okay, I'll come to you

23
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.900
It can be regarded as making your store shine

24
00:00:49.933 --> 00:00:51.266
Lord Qin's rules

25
00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:54.600
Panax notoginseng Kai takes you as friends of angels

26
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.666
Give you some preferential feed.

27
00:00:56.666 --> 00:00:57.700
Is it okay?

28
00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.833
Okay, the bridge is in pretty good condition

29
00:01:06.066 --> 00:01:07.600
This stuff is nice

30
00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:08.800
I'll just accept it.

31
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.566
Let go I let you let go

32
00:01:10.566 --> 00:01:12.533
Do you hear me?

33
00:01:12.533 --> 00:01:13.466
What's up?

34
00:01:14.066 --> 00:01:15.033
What is fierce

35
00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:16.900
Court death, I tell you

36
00:01:17.566 --> 00:01:19.166
Anyone who wants to work with me

37
00:01:19.266 --> 00:01:20.700
Only 19 open.

38
00:01:20.866 --> 00:01:23.666
I got the ball what did you say

39
00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:25.833
Do you know how powerful the piano sound is?

40
00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.366
How many people begged to cooperate with him?

41
00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.866
No matter how many people beg to cooperate with him

42
00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.266
My rule is that he doesn't matter who comes

43
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.266
What does Master Bai mean?

44
00:01:37.266 --> 00:01:38.900
Are you looking down on me?

45
00:01:38.933 --> 00:01:40.566
Still look down on Master Qin

46
00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.566
Dear, this is a misunderstanding.

47
00:01:42.666 --> 00:01:45.133
Bridge, what nonsense are you talking about?

48
00:01:45.133 --> 00:01:46.000
Do you know

49
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.333
How much effort did Chen Tianshi put in?

50
00:01:47.333 --> 00:01:48.766
It's anger that sets you up for a relationship

51
00:01:48.766 --> 00:01:50.900
You can't waste his hard work.

52
00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:53.800
Yes, Qiaoliang, you don't need to think about it again.
