00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.266
I'll start first

2
00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:06.466
Then you have no chance, haha.

3
00:00:17.933 --> 00:00:20.300
This painting of a bamboo forest from the Tang Dynasty is nice

4
00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:21.800
masterpieces

5
00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.300
That's a lot of money.

6
00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:24.600
Oh, dear.

7
00:00:25.166 --> 00:00:27.133
As expected of a good boss

8
00:00:27.133 --> 00:00:29.400
Really discerning

9
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:30.700
This bamboo forest diagram

10
00:00:30.733 --> 00:00:33.833
It is indeed an heirloom of our Feng family

11
00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:37.166
It's also the most expensive thing in our house

12
00:00:37.166 --> 00:00:40.733
Hahaha, I can see it at a glance.

13
00:00:40.733 --> 00:00:42.500
No difficulty no difficulty

14
00:00:42.566 --> 00:00:44.166
Hahahaha

15
00:00:45.066 --> 00:00:46.966
That's my turn.

16
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.066
To your fart

17
00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:49.500
Didn't you hear my dad?

18
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.900
This picture is the most valuable thing in our house

19
00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.100
Now the winner is tied

20
00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.300
Who says this is the most valuable thing?

21
00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.266
What do you mean?

22
00:00:58.366 --> 00:00:59.566
What do you mean?

23
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.600
You know my family better than I do, don't you?

24
00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:02.400
Certainly.

25
00:01:03.166 --> 00:01:05.833
Hahahahaha

26
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.500
Big men can't afford to lose

27
00:01:08.666 --> 00:01:10.033
giggling

28
00:01:10.066 --> 00:01:11.366
In this world

29
00:01:11.366 --> 00:01:12.900
How can someone like you exist?

30
00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.666
It's disgusting, it's won or lost

31
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.500
You can go now.

32
00:01:17.533 --> 00:01:20.900
Why can't you hear what Master Huang said?

33
00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:24.466
Get out hahaha you

34
00:01:25.133 --> 00:01:26.966
Do you know what antiques are?

35
00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.366
You're the only one who can point fingers at me

36
00:01:29.933 --> 00:01:30.966
Go away

37
00:01:31.066 --> 00:01:34.166
My eyes are the only criterion

38
00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:35.666
Are you crazy?

39
00:01:35.666 --> 00:01:38.166
You little brat is just us crazy

40
00:01:38.366 --> 00:01:40.600
It's not your turn to get addicted to yourself in our house

41
00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.200
You get out of here now

42
00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.533
Uncle, you do beat people

43
00:01:44.533 --> 00:01:47.800
The most expensive thing in your house is not this painting

44
00:01:48.066 --> 00:01:49.033
but

45
00:01:49.733 --> 00:01:51.000
This Buddha head

46
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.466
He is the true national treasure

47
00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:55.700
Do you mean this Buddha head?

48
00:01:55.933 --> 00:01:57.966
Boy I have to say

49
00:01:58.133 --> 00:02:00.266
You're a bit strict, aren't you?

50
00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:02.266
This Buddha head is indeed an old object

51
00:02:02.466 --> 00:02:06.500
Haha, but compared to this picture of a bamboo forest

52
00:02:06.533 --> 00:02:08.800
The value is far worse
