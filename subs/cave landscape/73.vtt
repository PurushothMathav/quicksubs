00:00:00.566 --> 00:00:02.000
Eat and drink well, okay?

2
00:00:02.966 --> 00:00:04.100
I'll find you to drink later

3
00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:08.600
Yo

4
00:00:08.933 --> 00:00:11.000
Happy New Year, Master Huang

5
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.966
Happy Chinese New Year

6
00:00:11.966 --> 00:00:13.100
Gong Xi Fa Cai

7
00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:14.000
The ball is done.

8
00:00:14.533 --> 00:00:15.566
Oh, dear.

9
00:00:16.166 --> 00:00:17.933
Since Qin Ye came to the voyage

10
00:00:17.933 --> 00:00:20.466
Your royal business is skyrocketing

11
00:00:20.466 --> 00:00:21.466
Thriving

12
00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:22.866
It's really enviable.

13
00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:24.900
It doesn't matter if our royal family is good or not

14
00:00:25.166 --> 00:00:27.500
The important thing is the bridge scum

15
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.566
The days are getting worse day by day

16
00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.033
Did Master Fang hear?

17
00:00:31.066 --> 00:00:33.500
His store hasn't opened yet.

18
00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.666
Hmph, it looks like it's going to yellow soon.

19
00:00:36.666 --> 00:00:39.100
Ouch, who let him offend Master Qin?

20
00:00:39.933 --> 00:00:42.066
This is the end of offending Qinying

21
00:00:42.066 --> 00:00:43.000
Don't tell me

22
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.333
It's New Year's Eve.

23
00:00:44.333 --> 00:00:45.966
I do miss him

24
00:00:45.966 --> 00:00:47.133
I don't know where he died.

25
00:00:47.133 --> 00:00:50.266
He must have found a place to hide

26
00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.900
Hahahaha, who said I was hiding?

27
00:00:54.766 --> 00:00:55.600
bridge

28
00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:58.866
This is the treasure for Master Qian tonight

29
00:00:58.866 --> 00:01:00.400
Please hand it over to Master Qian

30
00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:02.900
Who made you do it?

31
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:05.266
What do you mean?

32
00:01:05.466 --> 00:01:06.133
What do you mean?

33
00:01:06.133 --> 00:01:08.533
Apparently it's a birthday dinner

34
00:01:08.533 --> 00:01:09.600
You represent Oolong

35
00:01:09.933 --> 00:01:11.600
Dare to stand with us

36
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.100
The bridge is my man

37
00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:14.800
But Master Qin doesn't like him

38
00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.966
Doesn't Miss Chen know?

39
00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.566
Master Qin wants to kill him

40
00:01:21.133 --> 00:01:22.400
Isn't it a gift?

41
00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.066
Didn't you see it? Isn't it right here?

42
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:27.066
Here it is.
