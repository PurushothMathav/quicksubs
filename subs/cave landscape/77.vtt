1
00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:01.466
As expected of Master Qin

2
00:00:01.466 --> 00:00:02.333
Long life.

3
00:00:02.333 --> 00:00:04.366
One coral gives away a store.

4
00:00:04.366 --> 00:00:05.466
What happened to my grandpa?

5
00:00:05.666 --> 00:00:07.633
Thank you Qiye, thank Qiye

6
00:00:08.766 --> 00:00:10.100
villain wins

7
00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:11.233
Next

8
00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:16.133
Here I am, I heard that the Fang family is the leader of the voyage

9
00:00:16.133 --> 00:00:18.233
It's always been sea life

10
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.133
I don't know what kind of gift it will bring.

11
00:00:21.133 --> 00:00:24.300
Sorry to be ugly

12
00:00:32.766 --> 00:00:34.500
Superb red coral

13
00:00:34.766 --> 00:00:37.400
Tonight this superb red coral

14
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.700
It was plucked from the sea in the early years

15
00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:40.600
It is said that at that time

16
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.366
Fighting a flood dragon for a whole day and night

17
00:00:43.366 --> 00:00:44.466
Just grabbed it

18
00:00:44.566 --> 00:00:45.700
invaluable

19
00:00:45.966 --> 00:00:49.633
Not bad. They say the bigger the coral, the better.

20
00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:53.066
This piece in front of me is more than a meter in diameter

21
00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.266
It's so precious.

22
00:00:56.566 --> 00:00:58.400
I didn't expect the Fang family to have such a baby

23
00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:59.700
To please Master Qin

24
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:00.900
This is Cher.

25
00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:02.500
It's hard to be square

26
00:01:02.933 --> 00:01:05.466
What do you say is good?

27
00:01:05.466 --> 00:01:09.766
But do you know what this thing is used for?

28
00:01:09.933 --> 00:01:14.033
It is said that the heavy rain was dedicated to the Dragon King of the East China Sea.

29
00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.433
What was he buried with?

30
00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.100
Hey

31
00:01:19.966 --> 00:01:23.833
This coral is both large and structural

32
00:01:23.933 --> 00:01:25.666
It's all brilliant.

33
00:01:25.766 --> 00:01:29.000
But this surface rust shows that

34
00:01:29.066 --> 00:01:31.533
This thing was picked up from the bottom of the sea

35
00:01:31.533 --> 00:01:32.866
Then it sank again

36
00:01:32.866 --> 00:01:33.866
What does that mean?

37
00:01:33.966 --> 00:01:36.000
This means it's a sacrifice

38
00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.800
Fang Yuan is at Master Qin's birthday banquet

39
00:01:39.366 --> 00:01:41.066
He actually offered a sacrifice

40
00:01:41.566 --> 00:01:42.833
He Juxin
