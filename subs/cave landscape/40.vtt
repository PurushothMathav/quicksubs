00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.200
Can this person survive being hit with a hammer?

2
00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:04.033
Certainly.

3
00:00:04.666 --> 00:00:07.233
The root of the old man's disease is on his head

4
00:00:07.333 --> 00:00:08.966
The ordinary method doesn't work at all

5
00:00:09.166 --> 00:00:11.800
Gotta break his breath with a hammer

6
00:00:12.166 --> 00:00:14.766
Nonsense, you keep talking about broken air

7
00:00:14.766 --> 00:00:16.200
Why can't I see you?

8
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:17.966
Grandpa must have banned you

9
00:00:17.966 --> 00:00:20.433
You are angry but deliberately want to kill grandpa

10
00:00:21.933 --> 00:00:24.100
Come on

11
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.466
Take him down for me

12
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:27.800
Don't worry.

13
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.600
The bridge approach sounds outrageous

14
00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.466
But it might actually work

15
00:00:31.466 --> 00:00:32.666
Anyway.

16
00:00:32.733 --> 00:00:34.866
I couldn't risk my grandfather's life

17
00:00:35.266 --> 00:00:36.800
Kick him out

18
00:00:37.666 --> 00:00:39.033
Hahaha

19
00:00:41.333 --> 00:00:43.066
Hahahaha

20
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.700
Who wants to be treated?

21
00:00:47.266 --> 00:00:49.000
The genius doctor is my grandfather

22
00:00:49.066 --> 00:00:51.500
You are the legendary doctor Situ

23
00:00:51.666 --> 00:00:54.900
I've heard for a long time that you can live and die

24
00:00:54.933 --> 00:00:57.566
I saw a miracle doctor today

25
00:00:57.566 --> 00:00:59.066
Show it to my grandpa

26
00:00:59.166 --> 00:01:00.600
My grandfather is dying

27
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:01.500
tribulation

28
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.766
As the saying goes, pain doesn't work

29
00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.966
Pain is not pain

30
00:01:10.666 --> 00:01:13.966
Hahaha, there is an old man here.

31
00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.033
Is there any accident?

32
00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.033
bold

33
00:01:20.133 --> 00:01:21.466
How dare you insult the genius doctor

34
00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.433
The doctor has been sick all his life

35
00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.366
It can also be your turn to point and point

36
00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.366
Hahaha lad

37
00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:31.900
Look at the fish

38
00:01:32.333 --> 00:01:33.700
You see people.

39
00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.233
Then tell me what happened to this old man.

40
00:01:40.266 --> 00:01:41.633
gas entry

41
00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.066
Hahahaha

42
00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:46.433
lad

43
00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.566
I can see that you are a person who knows nothing.

44
00:01:50.866 --> 00:01:53.800
What kind of broken device is there in the world?

45
00:01:54.466 --> 00:01:56.500
Ahahaha

46
00:01:56.766 --> 00:01:59.966
Come, come, come, take a look at the old man
