00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:02.666
Grandpa, you're awake

2
00:00:03.333 --> 00:00:05.400
Master, you are all right

3
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.566
I feel now

4
00:00:07.933 --> 00:00:09.366
refreshed

5
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.266
You have so much strength.

6
00:00:12.566 --> 00:00:13.966
This is the head.

7
00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:17.600
It kind of hurts, thanks to the bridge.

8
00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.033
Put it down now

9
00:00:19.066 --> 00:00:22.033
Right, right, right, put the bridge down, hum.

10
00:00:22.566 --> 00:00:24.500
Kindly save you but be a donkey liver and lung

11
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:25.900
I almost lost my life

12
00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.166
The old man misunderstood you.

13
00:00:28.533 --> 00:00:30.400
I didn't expect my finger wrench

14
00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.700
Is he guilty of something?

15
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.433
Almost killed the old man

16
00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.233
Grandpa is my fault

17
00:00:38.266 --> 00:00:39.633
I'm not good at learning

18
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.166
I can't see that there is something wrong with this class paper.

19
00:00:42.166 --> 00:00:43.666
Almost killed grandpa

20
00:00:44.133 --> 00:00:45.566
It's not your fault.

21
00:00:45.566 --> 00:00:47.100
I didn't see it either.

22
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.733
Because of the bridge.

23
00:00:48.733 --> 00:00:51.500
We should thank him very much.

24
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:52.300
Iron pool

25
00:00:52.933 --> 00:00:54.266
What about this quack doctor?

26
00:00:54.966 --> 00:00:57.666
Hahaha, not very good at learning.

27
00:00:57.733 --> 00:01:00.800
How dare you come out to see the old man?

28
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.266
Beat him up

29
00:01:02.333 --> 00:01:03.566
Blow me out

30
00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.900
I'm going back.

31
00:01:05.066 --> 00:01:06.000
No, I'm not.

32
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.366
Bridge, you saved the old man

33
00:01:11.466 --> 00:01:13.800
If you have any requirements, just mention it.

34
00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:15.000
I promise

35
00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.966
I don't ask for anything.

36
00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.033
It's just the lack of money.

37
00:01:20.166 --> 00:01:21.633
Recently opened a store

38
00:01:22.266 --> 00:01:24.066
Hey, I'm short of money.

39
00:01:24.966 --> 00:01:27.400
Oh this is easy

40
00:01:27.533 --> 00:01:28.800
The issue of funding

41
00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.233
As many as you want.

42
00:01:32.166 --> 00:01:33.000
But

43
00:01:33.533 --> 00:01:35.000
The old man wants to

44
00:01:36.366 --> 00:01:39.633
My granddaughter is getting bigger.

45
00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.066
I want to entrust him to you

46
00:01:42.133 --> 00:01:43.433
What do you think?

47
00:01:43.933 --> 00:01:47.600
This Heavenly Master, this grandfather

48
00:01:47.866 --> 00:01:49.966
How is this kid worthy of me?
