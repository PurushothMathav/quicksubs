00:00:11.133 --> 00:00:13.600
What is the bridge looking at?

2
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.066
Mr. Feng, I didn't see anything

3
00:00:16.066 --> 00:00:16.866
Didn't see anything

4
00:00:16.866 --> 00:00:18.166
I recruited you as a student

5
00:00:18.166 --> 00:00:19.633
Not for you to see this

6
00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:20.733
What time is it?

7
00:00:20.733 --> 00:00:22.733
Hurry up and take out Master Fang's baby!

8
00:00:22.733 --> 00:00:23.866
Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes

9
00:00:23.966 --> 00:00:24.900
What are you waiting for?

10
00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.566
When I make money, I will definitely let you hand over the house

11
00:00:29.566 --> 00:00:32.033
Sister, I already said that this kid can't do it

12
00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.800
You said you were looking for an apprentice, not a smarter one

13
00:00:35.066 --> 00:00:38.633
At least you are an antique guy, shut up

14
00:00:39.866 --> 00:00:41.466
Where did I get your money?

15
00:00:41.466 --> 00:00:42.500
Buy these famous brands

16
00:00:42.866 --> 00:00:44.833
Me?

17
00:00:45.066 --> 00:00:47.800
I bought the antique certificate myself

18
00:00:48.133 --> 00:00:50.833
That sister will come later

19
00:00:51.333 --> 00:00:52.800
Can we go first?

20
00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.300
No, you stay with me

21
00:00:55.666 --> 00:00:57.500
Oh, Mr. Feng

22
00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:58.800
This is what Master Fang is preparing

23
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.433
The baby participating in the national treasure competition

24
00:01:01.166 --> 00:01:02.400
It's beautiful.

25
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.000
Beautiful is beautiful

26
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.600
Too bad it's fake

27
00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.633
What? How could that be fake?

28
00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:11.133
That jade screen?

29
00:01:11.133 --> 00:01:12.000
One without pulp

30
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.100
No skin

31
00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:14.566
Even the cyan is artificially dyed

32
00:01:14.566 --> 00:01:15.700
And the Nayinae line.

33
00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.266
Obvious machine marks

34
00:01:17.466 --> 00:01:20.566
How can Young Master Yi Yanqiang Fang say that he is also an industry boss?

35
00:01:20.733 --> 00:01:23.066
Why would you take a counterfeit to the competition?

36
00:01:23.466 --> 00:01:25.366
I guess I was deceived.

37
00:01:25.366 --> 00:01:26.833
Talk to him later

38
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.700
No, I can't let them find out about my bag.

39
00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.033
I have to figure something out.

40
00:01:34.466 --> 00:01:37.066
Where's my little baby?

41
00:01:37.366 --> 00:01:38.833
Ah, little Fang

42
00:01:39.866 --> 00:01:40.966
Hey, there it is.

43
00:01:40.966 --> 00:01:44.000
Xiaoliang, hurry up and give it to Fang Shao, okay?

44
00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.666
Hey.

45
00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.066
Qiao Lian, what are you doing? I'm sorry, Young Master Fang.

46
00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.966
I didn't mean to.

47
00:01:52.966 --> 00:01:54.900
Why is this bottle suddenly so slippery?

48
00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:56.500
But don't worry about that.

49
00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:57.966
This thing is fake

50
00:01:58.066 --> 00:02:00.566
It's fake, it's Fang Shao

51
00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:01.733
It's really fake.

52
00:02:01.733 --> 00:02:03.433
I also want to tell you

53
00:02:03.533 --> 00:02:06.266
You listen to this thing is real or fake

54
00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:11.600
I went here but I spent 10 million to escape

55
00:02:11.766 --> 00:02:14.066
It's for me to participate in the Hangzhou National Treasure Competition

56
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.266
Ah, sorry.

57
00:02:16.366 --> 00:02:18.133
Second young master, I'm sorry, I'm sorry

58
00:02:18.133 --> 00:02:20.566
I didn't mean to be sorry, fuck you.

59
00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.966
Ahhh

60
00:02:25.566 --> 00:02:26.366
Ah!

61
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.166
I'm going to see you.

62
00:02:32.533 --> 00:02:34.933
This happened in your store.

63
00:02:34.933 --> 00:02:36.366
It has nothing to do with me

64
00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.866
So you come up with another solution.

65
00:02:38.866 --> 00:02:39.666
So be it.

66
00:02:39.866 --> 00:02:40.966
Find me one.

67
00:02:40.966 --> 00:02:43.000
How about the exact same bottle?

68
00:02:43.133 --> 00:02:44.133
Otherwise

69
00:02:44.133 --> 00:02:47.100
Don't even think about opening this store anymore, right?

70
00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:48.200
Are you a liar?

71
00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.066
Where can I find you the exact same one?

72
00:02:50.066 --> 00:02:53.033
Hahaha, this has nothing to do with me.

73
00:02:53.366 --> 00:02:54.166
Oh, right.

74
00:02:54.166 --> 00:02:56.966
I remember you seem to have a treasure in town, right?

75
00:02:56.966 --> 00:02:58.133
I think that's a good one.

76
00:02:58.133 --> 00:02:59.500
So I'll come and pick it up tomorrow.

77
00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:00.966
If you can't see him

78
00:03:00.966 --> 00:03:02.200
I'll take your store

79
00:03:02.566 --> 00:03:04.033
It's all smashed

80
00:03:06.166 --> 00:03:07.566
Don't play tricks

81
00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:13.000
Uh-huh.
