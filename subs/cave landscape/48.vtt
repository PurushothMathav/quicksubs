00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.200
It is said that the royal family and the Fang family jointly made it

2
00:00:03.366 --> 00:00:04.766
It seems that Qin Ye's name is used

3
00:00:04.766 --> 00:00:07.266
I can't help you without grandpa.

4
00:00:07.766 --> 00:00:09.300
OK, I see.

5
00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:14.033
What's the matter? My store's expectations are gone.

6
00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:17.633
Hahahaha, did you hear that?

7
00:00:17.666 --> 00:00:19.800
This antique store has lost its expectations

8
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.466
It's like breaking your arms.

9
00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.233
See how you live

10
00:00:23.466 --> 00:00:25.066
If you don't expect it, you can find it again.

11
00:00:25.466 --> 00:00:28.300
Teacher Fang, please go to my store and wait for me first.

12
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:29.666
I'll figure it out.

13
00:00:37.266 --> 00:00:38.400
Bridge hmm

14
00:00:38.666 --> 00:00:40.033
Why did you call me out?

15
00:00:40.166 --> 00:00:42.166
I said the expected things can't help you

16
00:00:42.166 --> 00:00:43.100
Or come back

17
00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:44.433
I don't want to come back.

18
00:00:44.466 --> 00:00:47.866
I just want you to take me to the stockyard to pick it out yourself

19
00:00:47.866 --> 00:00:48.933
Do you want to gamble on stones?

20
00:00:48.933 --> 00:00:50.466
Um no no no

21
00:00:50.466 --> 00:00:52.300
This is not for little kids to play with.

22
00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:54.166
Stone gambling is different from looking at antiques

23
00:00:55.066 --> 00:00:57.833
Besides, those predictions are expensive

24
00:00:57.933 --> 00:00:59.233
How do you have that much money?

25
00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:01.633
Is that why I came to you?

26
00:01:02.133 --> 00:01:04.066
Give me money

27
00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.500
In your dreams, you think I am stupid and have a lot of money.

28
00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.766
Take the money and waste it

29
00:01:09.933 --> 00:01:10.800
Hey

30
00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:14.466
Your grandfather told you before he left

31
00:01:14.566 --> 00:01:16.300
I'm opening a store, you need to help

32
00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:18.100
Now there is a problem with my store.

33
00:01:18.133 --> 00:01:19.333
What's wrong with you giving some money?

34
00:01:19.333 --> 00:01:20.133
Hey you

35
00:01:22.966 --> 00:01:25.066
Okay, just this once.

36
00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:26.966
It has nothing to do with me after helping you.

37
00:01:27.966 --> 00:01:29.766
Thank you, Miss Chen.
