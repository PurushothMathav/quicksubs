00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.500
It's actually the best purple glass

2
00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:03.733
It's the first time I've seen you.

3
00:00:03.733 --> 00:00:05.266
Oh, my God.

4
00:00:05.466 --> 00:00:10.466
It seems that someone just said what to do with the whole family

5
00:00:10.533 --> 00:00:12.166
Why don't you go back and have a look?

6
00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:13.500
Be careful

7
00:00:13.933 --> 00:00:15.066
How could this be?

8
00:00:15.333 --> 00:00:16.366
That's not possible.

9
00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.300
Xiao Liang, you are amazing

10
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.166
How did you know there was purple glass?

11
00:00:20.333 --> 00:00:21.266
Yeah bro

12
00:00:21.266 --> 00:00:23.566
Usually in the core at this time

13
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.600
This is the first time I've seen your liver grow

14
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.666
Hahaha good luck good luck

15
00:00:28.666 --> 00:00:29.800
Hey you say

16
00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.966
So here we have this purple vitreous seed.

17
00:00:32.166 --> 00:00:34.900
Is there any problem with opening the store? Of course there is no problem.

18
00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:36.466
With this purple glass seed

19
00:00:36.466 --> 00:00:37.800
Add your Heavenly Master to go down the mountain

20
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.366
Sure to attract a lot of people

21
00:00:39.566 --> 00:00:43.966
Oh, then I have to thank Master Fang

22
00:00:43.966 --> 00:00:45.666
Let's go for a long walk

23
00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:47.166
Just next time.

24
00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.433
Hahahaha bye bye

25
00:01:17.666 --> 00:01:19.400
What are you doing, you and I are burning porcelain

26
00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:20.633
What are you adding?

27
00:01:21.333 --> 00:01:22.866
You will thank me.

28
00:01:23.333 --> 00:01:24.700
Must not go

29
00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.033
It's over. It's over.

30
00:01:31.133 --> 00:01:34.000
The good porcelain bowl burned down

31
00:01:34.666 --> 00:01:35.766
Ah boss

32
00:01:36.466 --> 00:01:38.400
Let me see this junk

33
00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.666
You like to give it to you

34
00:01:42.766 --> 00:01:46.800
God, this is actually an ice crack

35
00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:49.800
Unexpectedly, this process that has disappeared for thousands of years

36
00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.600
Reborn

37
00:01:51.766 --> 00:01:52.900
How did this burn?

38
00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:54.000
I don't know.

39
00:01:54.133 --> 00:01:55.100
A young man.

40
00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.166
Throwing a stone into the stove

41
00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.500
Young man, if you dedicate it to Qin Ye

42
00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:03.900
Then we royal

43
00:02:04.466 --> 00:02:08.400
I'm going to soar, hahahaha.
