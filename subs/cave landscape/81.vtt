00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:01.533
Ignorant and ridiculous

2
00:00:01.533 --> 00:00:02.733
See clearly

3
00:00:02.733 --> 00:00:04.300
This is an ice crack

4
00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:06.500
Could it be that there is a second one in this world?

5
00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:09.000
Sure. What does the little orange say?

6
00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:18.533
Look good don't blink

7
00:00:18.533 --> 00:00:21.066
This is my army

8
00:00:21.733 --> 00:00:23.300
What? How?

9
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.766
Master Wang, what's the situation?

10
00:00:25.766 --> 00:00:26.833
You boss

11
00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.800
Mingming told me that only one arrow was successful

12
00:00:30.266 --> 00:00:32.000
There is no second arrow.

13
00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:35.266
Where did it come from? I did it. You did it

14
00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.433
What are you awesome how could you make it

15
00:00:40.733 --> 00:00:44.733
He must have bought it from someone else tonight

16
00:00:44.733 --> 00:00:45.533
Yes!

17
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.466
This one alone doesn't prove anything at all

18
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.066
It only means that this brat is lucky

19
00:00:51.066 --> 00:00:52.933
Just happened to get this one

20
00:00:52.933 --> 00:00:54.333
One is luck

21
00:00:54.333 --> 00:00:56.166
But 100 pieces are afraid not.

22
00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.700
You said you have 100 pieces.

23
00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:00.200
Do you know

24
00:01:00.266 --> 00:01:02.100
This lost craft for thousands of years

25
00:01:02.266 --> 00:01:03.966
If you have it

26
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:08.400
That would rock the antique world.

27
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.100
That can be filled

28
00:01:10.866 --> 00:01:14.600
It's impossible to play with a sword

29
00:01:14.766 --> 00:01:16.166
Just blow it

30
00:01:16.166 --> 00:01:17.833
Such a complex process

31
00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.366
No one in the world can make it

32
00:01:21.566 --> 00:01:23.033
Who is it?

33
00:01:28.533 --> 00:01:30.833
A broken mouth on the head is fooling around here
