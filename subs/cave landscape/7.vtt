00:00:05.966 --> 00:00:08.433
Lost a treasure today

2
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:10.233
I feel so uncomfortable.

3
00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:12.000
Can you talk to me?

4
00:00:14.966 --> 00:00:16.666
Send me a photo of you swimming.

5
00:00:34.866 --> 00:00:38.200
Are you kidding me? I want a swimsuit photo.

6
00:00:39.366 --> 00:00:40.566
Don't be angry.

7
00:00:40.666 --> 00:00:43.200
I can't just send pictures to people.

8
00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:45.966
If you want to see us meet, okay?

9
00:00:46.666 --> 00:00:48.600
If you knew who I was

10
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.200
How else can I teach you?

11
00:00:52.166 --> 00:00:53.900
Go to the antique market tomorrow.

12
00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:55.666
To wear the sexiest clothes

13
00:00:55.666 --> 00:00:57.666
Remember to match it with black silk.

14
00:00:58.900 --> 00:00:59.700
Ah!

15
00:00:59.766 --> 00:01:04.100
Haha, Mr. Feng, Mr. Feng

16
00:01:04.166 --> 00:01:06.600
You iceberg beauty

17
00:01:06.866 --> 00:01:09.033
I finally got it

18
00:01:10.733 --> 00:01:12.200
Hey sister

19
00:01:12.333 --> 00:01:14.400
How about this?

20
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.966
This is bronze, right?

21
00:01:18.966 --> 00:01:19.900
This is old

22
00:01:20.166 --> 00:01:21.300
That's not bad.

23
00:01:21.366 --> 00:01:22.800
We seem to have one in our store.

24
00:01:22.933 --> 00:01:25.900
I'll see if you're really obedient

25
00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:29.500
You see

26
00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.266
Oh this is so obedient

27
00:01:36.766 --> 00:01:37.566
Good two

28
00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:40.633
Ah!

29
00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.366
Bridge, what are you sneaking around looking at?

30
00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:45.733
Ah, hello, Mr. Feng

31
00:01:45.733 --> 00:01:47.233
I'm fine, just take a look

32
00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.333
Teacher Feng is also your teacher

33
00:01:49.333 --> 00:01:51.266
You kid has been fired

34
00:01:51.533 --> 00:01:52.500
What are you doing here?

35
00:01:52.566 --> 00:01:53.700
Did I say that?

36
00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.500
Take a look at the shoes and buy a few treasures.

37
00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:59.300
Pick a few treasures and it's just you.

38
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.800
This is an antique market

39
00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:03.300
You can't come.

40
00:02:11.066 --> 00:02:15.000
Mentor, you made it easy for me to find, who are you?
