1
00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.400
My grandfather specially arranged for me

2
00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:02.733
Let you go out to avoid the limelight

3
00:00:02.733 --> 00:00:04.366
The voyage can't wait

4
00:00:04.366 --> 00:00:05.366
Is it that serious?

5
00:00:05.366 --> 00:00:07.400
Of course, after this dinner

6
00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:08.866
Lord Qin is ready to wash his hands in a golden basin

7
00:00:08.866 --> 00:00:10.866
The business of the future voyage will be handed over to the emperor

8
00:00:10.866 --> 00:00:11.866
Home and his wife

9
00:00:11.866 --> 00:00:14.166
And you offended them both unknowingly

10
00:00:14.166 --> 00:00:15.866
If you don't hurry up, what are you waiting for?

11
00:00:15.866 --> 00:00:16.800
How can I have

12
00:00:17.366 --> 00:00:18.000
Pardon me?

13
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.666
I said I'm not going anywhere.

14
00:00:20.766 --> 00:00:23.866
And what kind of banquet is Master Qin's?

15
00:00:24.066 --> 00:00:25.666
I'd like to join in the fun

16
00:00:25.666 --> 00:00:28.433
You're crazy, I have a batch of treasures in my hands now

17
00:00:28.966 --> 00:00:30.866
I promise as soon as he sees

18
00:00:30.866 --> 00:00:33.666
It will definitely shock you, it is simply unreasonable

19
00:00:33.666 --> 00:00:35.100
Don't put gold on your face

20
00:00:35.133 --> 00:00:36.400
There are countless green coconut treasures

21
00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:37.933
I have never seen any kind of treasure

22
00:00:37.933 --> 00:00:39.033
Don't embarrass yourself

23
00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:41.800
Bridge Miss Chen is right

24
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.666
Lord Qin is well-informed

25
00:00:43.966 --> 00:00:45.733
Impossible to be interested in your stuff

26
00:00:45.733 --> 00:00:47.300
Let's not go out there and frown.

27
00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:48.966
Don't worry.

28
00:00:48.966 --> 00:00:50.400
This is a gift for the dinner party

29
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:51.733
Everything above

30
00:00:51.733 --> 00:00:53.700
No less than your Heavenly Master coming down the mountain

31
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.166
Especially with the finale auction item

32
00:00:56.266 --> 00:00:58.433
It is said to be lost porcelain

33
00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:00.466
Lost porcelain

34
00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.600
Why is this a little small with my soldier crack?

35
00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:04.866
Do you still want to go?

36
00:01:04.866 --> 00:01:06.800
Go why not go

37
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:07.700
But

38
00:01:08.133 --> 00:01:11.133
I would like to ask Miss Chen to do me one last favor

39
00:01:11.133 --> 00:01:15.000
What are you doing? Get me an invitation coupon?
