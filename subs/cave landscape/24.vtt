00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.266
You have a way

2
00:00:01.266 --> 00:00:02.333
What can you do?

3
00:00:02.333 --> 00:00:03.500
Now the entire voyage

4
00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:04.900
No one dares to trade with you at all

5
00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:07.233
Your angel can't be sold at all when he goes down the mountain.

6
00:00:07.466 --> 00:00:08.700
I have no intention of selling

7
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.000
I'm going to a place where transactions are unlimited

8
00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:12.900
where

9
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.033
Ghost market

10
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.166
I want to see stockings off my legs

11
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.266
Hey, have you arrived yet?

12
00:00:39.733 --> 00:00:40.666
Here it is.

13
00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:42.866
Hey, Mr. Feng

14
00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:44.266
It's not safe here

15
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.766
I'll go down alone

16
00:00:46.966 --> 00:00:48.833
Then be careful

17
00:00:53.733 --> 00:00:55.566
So this is the ghost world?

18
00:00:55.566 --> 00:00:56.866
How is the world?

19
00:00:56.866 --> 00:00:59.633
Honey, come and buy something.

20
00:00:59.766 --> 00:01:03.033
It's you dear

21
00:01:03.466 --> 00:01:05.233
Do we know each other?

22
00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:06.900
I don't know each other.

23
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.000
See you for the first time?

24
00:01:08.533 --> 00:01:11.133
I want to ask for something nice today

25
00:01:11.133 --> 00:01:15.566
Oh, we're all good stuff here

26
00:01:15.566 --> 00:01:17.400
I'll show you

27
00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.066
Hmm go

28
00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:20.700
sister

29
00:01:22.766 --> 00:01:24.133
This bracelet

30
00:01:24.133 --> 00:01:26.300
What do you think?

31
00:01:29.133 --> 00:01:30.466
Ah, no way!

32
00:01:30.733 --> 00:01:32.533
Ouch boss boss

33
00:01:32.533 --> 00:01:34.000
I am the best Jade Buddha

34
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.233
This Buddha belongs to the Yuan, Ming and Qing Dynasties

35
00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.866
Honey, look at this again, boss.

36
00:01:43.866 --> 00:01:45.566
Take a look at blue and white porcelain, boss

37
00:01:46.133 --> 00:01:47.600
Take a look at the blue and white porcelain.

38
00:01:47.866 --> 00:01:51.366
I want something better.

39
00:01:51.766 --> 00:01:53.900
Something different.

40
00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.833
It's easy to change.

41
00:01:57.066 --> 00:02:00.566
Today, someone just cheated on me

42
00:02:00.766 --> 00:02:04.466
How about showing you a long experience?

43
00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.066
Let's go then, dear.
