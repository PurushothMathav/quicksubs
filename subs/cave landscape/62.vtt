00:00:01.133 --> 00:00:02.466
Tired of living, right?

2
00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:03.566
Go away

3
00:00:03.933 --> 00:00:05.900
Stand there and be honest, don't move

4
00:00:06.466 --> 00:00:07.300
Brother Tiger

5
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.766
Why is it you again?

6
00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:13.766
I spared your life last time

7
00:00:13.766 --> 00:00:16.966
How dare you come to trouble my brother this time?

8
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:18.533
Are you tired of living?

9
00:00:18.533 --> 00:00:20.700
Brother Tiger is not bad for me

10
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:22.800
I am a tiger coming down the mountain without riding the wind

11
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.800
I bumped into the bridge and got pissed off

12
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.266
This has nothing to do with me

13
00:00:26.266 --> 00:00:29.200
So what do these people do?

14
00:00:29.766 --> 00:00:32.233
They -- they all volunteered.

15
00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:34.866
I just can't stand the despicable behavior of bridges

16
00:00:35.266 --> 00:00:36.333
I want to talk to him

17
00:00:36.333 --> 00:00:39.500
They're just robbing

18
00:00:39.566 --> 00:00:42.933
Don't talk nonsense, we are helping each other when we see injustice

19
00:00:42.933 --> 00:00:44.033
I'll tell you what.

20
00:00:44.066 --> 00:00:46.833
These people are clearly found by him.

21
00:00:47.533 --> 00:00:49.566
The social road always loves you, Brother Wen

22
00:00:49.566 --> 00:00:50.900
I advise you not to talk nonsense.

23
00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:52.700
I don't know any of these people.

24
00:00:54.466 --> 00:00:56.200
So you mean to say

25
00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.400
These people have nothing to do with you anymore.

26
00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:59.233
Come

27
00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.666
Send me all these robbers to jail

28
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:03.800
Why go to jail?

29
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.500
Didn't you say you robbed something and left?

30
00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.800
Bo Ge and the others didn't talk about going to jail?

31
00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:10.966
What else do you have to say?

32
00:01:10.966 --> 00:01:13.266
Lazy dogs a bunch of stinky dogs

33
00:01:13.533 --> 00:01:14.466
Go away

34
00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:21.233
All right, get up, old man

35
00:01:22.766 --> 00:01:25.700
Huang Wei, you also said that this person is not what you are looking for.

36
00:01:25.933 --> 00:01:28.866
Brother Tiger is here today, I can't forgive you lightly

37
00:01:29.066 --> 00:01:29.866
Come

38
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.333
Give me this old lamp

39
00:01:32.333 --> 00:01:34.400
And this bitch dragged me out to fight

40
00:01:36.533 --> 00:01:39.366
No, I'm an old man, I'm a disadvantaged group

41
00:01:39.366 --> 00:01:41.066
Who dares to touch me, you stinky mouth?

42
00:01:41.066 --> 00:01:43.166
I hate people who rely on the old to sell the old

43
00:01:43.166 --> 00:01:44.700
Hit me to death

44
00:01:44.766 --> 00:01:45.366
Not forgiveness

45
00:01:45.366 --> 00:01:46.166
And you.

46
00:01:47.166 --> 00:01:49.866
And you take him down for me.
