00:00:02.166 --> 00:00:03.800
Master, look

2
00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:06.700
This baby is a white marble I just received.

3
00:00:06.733 --> 00:00:07.733
Unique jade

4
00:00:07.733 --> 00:00:09.666
The key is 800,000

5
00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:13.766
Xiaopeng, don't waste money in the future

6
00:00:13.766 --> 00:00:15.666
This is just a normal hanger.

7
00:00:15.766 --> 00:00:18.866
The vegetable market is two dollars a piece.

8
00:00:19.066 --> 00:00:20.666
I thought it was some kind of baby

9
00:00:20.666 --> 00:00:22.666
Oops, I was deceived again.

10
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:23.933
But it's okay

11
00:00:23.933 --> 00:00:24.966
My dad is rich

12
00:00:25.066 --> 00:00:26.600
Flower whatever hehe

13
00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:27.800
By the way, Master Xu

14
00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.066
Master Bai will hold a national treasure competition in two days.

15
00:00:30.066 --> 00:00:31.066
I must take it

16
00:00:31.066 --> 00:00:32.333
Master Xu has a high eye

17
00:00:32.333 --> 00:00:33.600
One of the judges again

18
00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.000
You have to help me take a good look today, okay?

19
00:00:38.333 --> 00:00:39.433
What is this?

20
00:00:41.366 --> 00:00:42.700
What happened to the master

21
00:00:43.066 --> 00:00:44.500
Hi of course what?

22
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.133
Isn't this the Pudong Stone Bridge?

23
00:00:46.133 --> 00:00:46.933
Hey

24
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.366
This is no ordinary stone ball

25
00:00:49.366 --> 00:00:51.000
This is the night pearl.

26
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.566
What hehe

27
00:00:53.866 --> 00:00:55.533
That's pretty understandable.

28
00:00:55.533 --> 00:00:58.466
Been with me for over 20 years on this shit

29
00:00:58.466 --> 00:01:00.500
Night Pearl Impossible

30
00:01:01.133 --> 00:01:03.166
Hmph, eyeless

31
00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.100
Here, let me show you.

32
00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.800
Come on, can you borrow 10 balls for one use?

33
00:01:10.666 --> 00:01:11.633
Master please

34
00:01:13.933 --> 00:01:15.233
Hey

35
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.200
Hey

36
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:18.800
Hey

37
00:01:19.066 --> 00:01:20.600
It really is the pearl of the night.

38
00:01:22.866 --> 00:01:24.566
One is priceless

39
00:01:24.566 --> 00:01:26.900
I didn't expect there to be three

40
00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.066
How could this be?

41
00:01:29.166 --> 00:01:31.200
Bring it, bring it

42
00:01:31.933 --> 00:01:33.700
Hey, let me tell you.

43
00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:37.033
This thing is mine and no one can take it from you.
