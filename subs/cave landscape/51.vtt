00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:01.200
I said bridge.

2
00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:04.366
Did you see me open this top-quality jade?

3
00:00:04.666 --> 00:00:05.566
Crazy

4
00:00:05.566 --> 00:00:07.166
Brother's trash, you want it too

5
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.300
Name a price

6
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:10.866
Since you really want it

7
00:00:10.866 --> 00:00:12.966
How about I give you a fair price?

8
00:00:13.133 --> 00:00:15.100
5 million 5 million

9
00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:16.766
This junk is not worth 5 yuan

10
00:00:16.766 --> 00:00:19.366
If you want to 5 million there is no way

11
00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.400
Who made people like bridges?

12
00:00:21.566 --> 00:00:24.066
Right? Oops bro.

13
00:00:24.266 --> 00:00:27.400
I advise you to be careful

14
00:00:27.733 --> 00:00:29.366
Isn't that 5 million?

15
00:00:29.366 --> 00:00:30.433
Here you are.

16
00:00:30.966 --> 00:00:32.666
Pay me no

17
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.400
I really think I'm stupid.

18
00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.100
5 million buy this junk

19
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:38.766
Trust me to pay

20
00:00:40.766 --> 00:00:41.833
I don't care.

21
00:00:43.666 --> 00:00:44.466
Ah!

22
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.666
Thanks, it's your fault.

23
00:00:50.566 --> 00:00:53.533
Boss, please put that pile of materials

24
00:00:53.533 --> 00:00:55.200
Slip the edge and cut it for me

25
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.166
Be careful not to go inside

26
00:00:57.333 --> 00:00:59.700
Brother, you are really stupid and have a lot of money.

27
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:01.566
How nice to meet you earlier.

28
00:01:01.566 --> 00:01:02.800
Look at your pity.

29
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.200
I won't accept these. Are you eating and drinking?

30
00:01:06.166 --> 00:01:07.533
I said bridge.

31
00:01:07.533 --> 00:01:10.200
I really don't know if I should call you stupid

32
00:01:10.366 --> 00:01:11.666
Or are you stupid?

33
00:01:11.666 --> 00:01:13.533
5 million buy that junk

34
00:01:13.533 --> 00:01:14.333
This money

35
00:01:15.333 --> 00:01:17.700
I really feel bad for such a brother.

36
00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.766
I didn't expect you to still be a demon

37
00:01:20.066 --> 00:01:21.966
Stupid and stupid trash

38
00:01:21.966 --> 00:01:26.166
I feel like there's someone standing right in front of me

39
00:01:26.166 --> 00:01:27.800
I'm not talking about you.

40
00:01:27.933 --> 00:01:29.566
I'm talking trash, not you

41
00:01:29.566 --> 00:01:31.166
Could it be that you admit that you are trash?

42
00:01:31.666 --> 00:01:34.266
Okay, I'll see how hard your mouth is.

43
00:01:34.333 --> 00:01:36.166
If only this pile of junk could be shipped

44
00:01:36.166 --> 00:01:37.766
My whole family tonight

45
00:01:38.966 --> 00:01:40.333
Shipped, shipped.

46
00:01:40.333 --> 00:01:41.066
He shipped it.

47
00:01:41.066 --> 00:01:43.500
All the best purple glass

48
00:01:44.466 --> 00:01:46.233
How is this possible?
