00:00:03.133 --> 00:00:05.566
Master Qiao, you mean this dung?

2
00:00:05.566 --> 00:00:07.533
This is what rural people use to use the toilet

3
00:00:07.533 --> 00:00:08.700
How could it be baby?

4
00:00:10.566 --> 00:00:12.400
This is priceless.

5
00:00:15.166 --> 00:00:17.066
Small two starts from 6

6
00:00:18.366 --> 00:00:20.766
This is also a national treasure

7
00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.200
Ah sister, take a look

8
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:25.900
What national treasure?

9
00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:27.100
So this is a dung bucket.

10
00:00:27.266 --> 00:00:28.800
It stinks, take it away

11
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.800
I don't understand. It's priceless

12
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.066
A true national treasure

13
00:00:32.366 --> 00:00:33.866
Does this work?

14
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.566
You have to.

15
00:00:35.566 --> 00:00:37.333
You don't want it, you don't want it, I want it.

16
00:00:37.333 --> 00:00:39.433
No, no, since Master Joe said it was a baby

17
00:00:39.466 --> 00:00:40.800
I want me to buy

18
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.600
Boss boss

19
00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.000
Ouch, Master Huang

20
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.200
Why did you come to my shop?

21
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.100
Li Baiqing, I have a few treasures recently.

22
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.433
Please add a piece of salt, no need.

23
00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.300
Just this and this and this

24
00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:58.900
The emperor's eye is for shit

25
00:00:58.933 --> 00:01:00.066
What are you talking about?

26
00:01:00.066 --> 00:01:03.066
Raise the price so that the emperor will look at me and say it well

27
00:01:03.266 --> 00:01:05.666
One price will charge you 500,000

28
00:01:07.733 --> 00:01:10.500
500,000 why don't you rob it?

29
00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.500
Master Huang, I am ancestral

30
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.733
It stinks but it's definitely genuine

31
00:01:16.733 --> 00:01:20.200
It is against my ancestral decision to sell it to you.

32
00:01:24.666 --> 00:01:25.466
OK

33
00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:29.100
Okay.

34
00:01:32.366 --> 00:01:34.333
Hey, I have a baby.

35
00:01:34.333 --> 00:01:37.233
I have a baby, I have a national treasure, haha.

36
00:01:38.133 --> 00:01:39.100
Hey, Mr. Xu

37
00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:39.966
You came just in time

38
00:01:39.966 --> 00:01:40.733
This is what I just taught

39
00:01:40.733 --> 00:01:43.033
The baby was selected by the Taoist priest Qiao himself for me

40
00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:44.300
Take a look.
