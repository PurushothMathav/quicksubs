1
00:00:03.133 --> 00:00:04.166
It is also a pit

2
00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:10.700
How is that possible?

3
00:00:10.966 --> 00:00:14.100
Is the Heavenly Master going down the mountain the king of death?

4
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:16.533
Unique presence in porcelain

5
00:00:16.533 --> 00:00:18.100
Disappeared for hundreds of years

6
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.500
How could it be hidden in this dung?

7
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:22.900
Impossible fake

8
00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:24.166
Must be fake

9
00:00:24.366 --> 00:00:26.100
This is just an ordinary cut

10
00:00:26.166 --> 00:00:27.900
Master, look again

11
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.200
Take a good look again.

12
00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:30.266
How could this be?

13
00:00:30.266 --> 00:00:31.966
Master, say something

14
00:00:31.966 --> 00:00:33.266
You must be fake, right?

15
00:00:33.266 --> 00:00:34.566
I booked all the hotels

16
00:00:34.566 --> 00:00:36.366
The whole city knows I'm from a luxury car

17
00:00:36.366 --> 00:00:38.500
I have received all the gifts for the national treasure

18
00:00:38.533 --> 00:00:40.700
The old man has been in business for 50 years

19
00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.233
Never seen such a perfect bottle

20
00:00:43.266 --> 00:00:46.366
That's right, this is the descent of the Heavenly Master

21
00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:47.833
King of the Females

22
00:00:48.533 --> 00:00:50.966
The troublemaker married my aunt

23
00:00:50.966 --> 00:00:55.066
It's too vulgar to measure such a national treasure with money

24
00:00:55.166 --> 00:00:58.066
So I'll give you this number

25
00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.066
Great, a hundred million.

26
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.766
It's not 10 billion, is it?

27
00:01:02.766 --> 00:01:04.033
A city

28
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:05.600
What!

29
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.933
Such porcelain is beyond the scope of the human world

30
00:01:08.933 --> 00:01:10.400
If in ancient times

31
00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.300
The king will not suffer a loss if he exchanges a city

32
00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:16.033
This porcelain carries the national fortune
