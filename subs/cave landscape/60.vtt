00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:03.166
Ah, what's the matter with you, daddy?

2
00:00:03.166 --> 00:00:05.200
Dad, don't scare me

3
00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:06.833
Hey, great.

4
00:00:06.933 --> 00:00:08.400
The eyes are amazing

5
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.600
Now we're talking to death. Listen again, it's you, Brother Huang

6
00:00:12.866 --> 00:00:14.600
You pissed my father off

7
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.033
You have to compensate me.

8
00:00:16.066 --> 00:00:17.200
I want 800 million

9
00:00:17.266 --> 00:00:19.033
What 800 million

10
00:00:19.466 --> 00:00:20.400
It's not that you are poor and crazy

11
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:21.900
How do we have that kind of money?

12
00:00:22.666 --> 00:00:25.200
Just give me that china vase and that jasmine seed.

13
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:26.000
Hey

14
00:00:26.366 --> 00:00:29.566
Love, you are thinking about my baby.

15
00:00:30.133 --> 00:00:31.700
You dream

16
00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.333
Come on people, come on people

17
00:00:35.333 --> 00:00:37.766
They wronged such a good man as my father

18
00:00:37.766 --> 00:00:39.066
Bullied by them like this

19
00:00:39.066 --> 00:00:42.266
Come here and see if you can piss people off

20
00:00:42.266 --> 00:00:44.800
Awesome dad hasn't opened the door yet

21
00:00:45.133 --> 00:00:47.100
The store is closed

22
00:00:47.566 --> 00:00:50.300
Bad luck, what can we do?

23
00:00:50.466 --> 00:00:51.533
Why not?

24
00:00:51.533 --> 00:00:52.900
So lively

25
00:00:53.533 --> 00:00:56.366
Huang Wen's little sister is so white

26
00:00:56.366 --> 00:00:58.666
Aren't you a bridge?

27
00:00:58.666 --> 00:01:00.500
Hey what's the matter

28
00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.733
Ah, everyone has a glorious moment

29
00:01:03.733 --> 00:01:05.533
Don't take a moment for forever

30
00:01:05.533 --> 00:01:07.966
You pissed me off hehehe

31
00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:10.200
Did you find this person?

32
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.366
A hundred causes must bear fruit

33
00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.733
You must come to frame me as an old man

34
00:01:14.733 --> 00:01:16.766
I don't know my father at all

35
00:01:16.766 --> 00:01:18.100
Please wake up

36
00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:19.966
These old people made you like this

37
00:01:19.966 --> 00:01:21.500
It's just unreasonable

38
00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.300
Somebody, somebody, somebody

39
00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:25.200
Hey, don't talk nonsense.

40
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.600
We didn't do it at all

41
00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:27.533
I saw you with my own eyes

42
00:01:27.533 --> 00:01:29.200
Bullied my father like this

43
00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.400
How dare you argue

44
00:01:30.733 --> 00:01:32.366
You have to give me an explanation today.

45
00:01:32.366 --> 00:01:33.466
Otherwise I won't go

46
00:01:33.466 --> 00:01:35.500
Okay, you want to say it, right?

47
00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.100
I'm taking her to the hospital now
