00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.600
I am a pig

2
00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.400
Haha uh

3
00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:08.766
Emperor, did I hear you right?

4
00:00:08.766 --> 00:00:10.033
You call him a master

5
00:00:10.333 --> 00:00:13.500
I haven't seen this kid for a day

6
00:00:13.566 --> 00:00:15.366
Master, after Master Xu left yesterday

7
00:00:15.366 --> 00:00:17.166
I keep telling you to find you

8
00:00:17.166 --> 00:00:18.866
The three night pearls in your hand

9
00:00:18.933 --> 00:00:20.233
It's a rare baby

10
00:00:20.533 --> 00:00:22.866
I am bound to win this Hangzhou competition

11
00:00:22.933 --> 00:00:24.500
Well, you make a price.

12
00:00:25.333 --> 00:00:29.700
Oh, the night pearl

13
00:00:29.866 --> 00:00:30.800
Excuse me.

14
00:00:30.866 --> 00:00:31.766
I don't really want to sell

15
00:00:32.133 --> 00:00:33.266
I bid high

16
00:00:33.266 --> 00:00:34.400
Master, think again

17
00:00:35.266 --> 00:00:36.233
Forget it.

18
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:38.866
Not for sale, in that case

19
00:00:38.866 --> 00:00:40.300
Then I won't force it.

20
00:00:40.933 --> 00:00:42.166
Master Xu is gone

21
00:00:42.166 --> 00:00:45.033
Why don't you help me choose a baby today?

22
00:00:46.533 --> 00:00:47.966
What about me?

23
00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:49.800
Never help people see things

24
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:55.100
Hey, hey, master, please help me.

25
00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:56.866
You are my life saver now

26
00:00:56.866 --> 00:00:59.000
If you don't help me, it's over.

27
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.033
What are you doing? There are so many people looking at you, okay?

28
00:01:02.166 --> 00:01:04.500
Since you are so sincere

29
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:05.800
I'll take a look for you.

30
00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:07.100
Hey, great.

31
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.366
Emperor, may I remind you?

32
00:01:09.366 --> 00:01:10.900
Don't be deceived

33
00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.966
Shut up, what the hell do you know?

34
00:01:12.966 --> 00:01:15.666
Hey, teacher, please go, go, go

35
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.400
Oh master

36
00:01:23.533 --> 00:01:25.100
There is still no suitable one.

37
00:01:26.366 --> 00:01:27.833
It's all rubbish

38
00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.400
Everything is rubbish

39
00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.066
I don't think you can see it.

40
00:01:32.066 --> 00:01:33.766
This has obtained several treasures.

41
00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.433
I think this finger wrench is good.

42
00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.800
No, this finger wrench is unlucky

43
00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:48.200
Look at something else. Hey

44
00:01:48.266 --> 00:01:49.366
Do you understand?

45
00:01:49.366 --> 00:01:52.166
Such a good finger wrench is actually unlucky

46
00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.700
Then you watched it for so long

47
00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.300
Is there anything good?

48
00:02:01.566 --> 00:02:03.566
That's it.
