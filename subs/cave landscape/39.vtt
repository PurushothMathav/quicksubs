00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:07.133
Grandpa, please hold on.

2
00:00:07.133 --> 00:00:08.666
The doctor will be here soon.

3
00:00:12.333 --> 00:00:13.666
How is this angel?

4
00:00:13.666 --> 00:00:16.600
No, I just smashed my finger.

5
00:00:16.866 --> 00:00:18.533
The angel restored the situation for a moment

6
00:00:18.533 --> 00:00:20.466
But then he fainted again.

7
00:00:20.666 --> 00:00:22.633
It may be that the qi is all over the body

8
00:00:22.966 --> 00:00:24.033
Let's go see

9
00:00:27.866 --> 00:00:30.000
Zihan, how is your grandfather?

10
00:00:30.766 --> 00:00:34.566
No, grandpa has been in a coma and can't wake up

11
00:00:36.533 --> 00:00:37.966
This is oh

12
00:00:37.966 --> 00:00:41.300
He was the first to find out that your grandfather had a problem

13
00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.233
He's a doctor

14
00:00:43.266 --> 00:00:45.966
I'm not but I can see your grandpa for you

15
00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.466
How is it? It's very bad.

16
00:00:54.766 --> 00:00:56.900
His handsomeness has gathered in Tianlinggai

17
00:00:57.866 --> 00:00:58.900
Who sent this?

18
00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:00.900
Idiot so cruel

19
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:02.533
This is to set heaven and death

20
00:01:02.533 --> 00:01:03.666
I sent it.

21
00:01:04.966 --> 00:01:07.766
Ah, you said there is something wrong with this finger trigger.

22
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.066
What do you suggest?

23
00:01:09.266 --> 00:01:11.500
Is it just your mouth?

24
00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.066
Hey, Zihan just smashed his finger.

25
00:01:14.066 --> 00:01:15.900
Your grandfather did wake up

26
00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.366
Uncle Bai, this doesn't mean anything

27
00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.266
Maybe it's just a coincidence

28
00:01:20.366 --> 00:01:22.800
Besides, this kid is not a doctor

29
00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:23.900
What does he know?

30
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.266
I have invited Dr. Situ to come over

31
00:01:26.566 --> 00:01:28.000
Don't bother others

32
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.533
You don't believe I can understand

33
00:01:29.533 --> 00:01:31.466
But now the old man is dying

34
00:01:31.466 --> 00:01:32.300
Time is running out

35
00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:33.566
Only I can save him

36
00:01:35.933 --> 00:01:37.966
What are you going to do about the bridge?

37
00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.366
Hit him on the head with a hammer

38
00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:43.000
What!
