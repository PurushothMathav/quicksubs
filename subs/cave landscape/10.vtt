00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:03.366
With this baby

2
00:00:03.366 --> 00:00:04.966
I see who dares to push Lai Lai

3
00:00:04.966 --> 00:00:06.700
Hehe, the national treasure conference in two days

4
00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:09.000
My baby will definitely surprise four people.

5
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.200
Mingzhen nationwide

6
00:00:10.366 --> 00:00:11.833
What the hell is this?

7
00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:14.166
This thing is not an antique at all

8
00:00:14.566 --> 00:00:16.466
Just an ordinary dung bucket

9
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.833
What hahaha

10
00:00:19.866 --> 00:00:21.066
I told you

11
00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:22.800
If this dung bucket can become a baby

12
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.600
Then the whole world is an antique

13
00:00:25.866 --> 00:00:28.266
Impossible, this is a living treasure

14
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.200
Master, please take a closer look.

15
00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:31.100
Don't look at it.

16
00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:32.300
I know what you mean.

17
00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:34.633
This barrel is indeed old

18
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.766
But it will never be more than 100 years old

19
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.366
And, all year round, soaked in fecal water

20
00:00:39.366 --> 00:00:41.400
It's rotten lotus root in here

21
00:00:41.466 --> 00:00:43.200
It's worthless.

22
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.800
Lao Wang, you didn't spend money to buy this thing, did you?

23
00:00:47.066 --> 00:00:48.466
Why didn't you spend it?

24
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.233
What kind of shit do you dare to lie to me?

25
00:00:55.566 --> 00:00:57.600
You don't believe me, do you?

26
00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:58.900
I'll prove it to you.

27
00:00:58.966 --> 00:00:59.766
This

28
00:01:00.066 --> 00:01:02.500
I said it, it's a counterfeit, you dare to speak

29
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:03.800
I was stupid

30
00:01:03.966 --> 00:01:06.433
You lied to me and took me for a fool.

31
00:01:07.333 --> 00:01:09.833
Bridge, I'm so disappointed in you.

32
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.233
Uh oh

33
00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:13.300
Hey, hey, hey.

34
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.966
Your Majesty, you can't eat it if it's dumb.

35
00:01:16.966 --> 00:01:18.600
You gotta make this kid pay

36
00:01:18.866 --> 00:01:20.600
Haha, that's right.

37
00:01:20.666 --> 00:01:23.433
You are the one who cost me 500,000

38
00:01:23.466 --> 00:01:25.000
Pay me pay me

39
00:01:26.333 --> 00:01:28.400
I have no money

40
00:01:28.466 --> 00:01:30.366
If you have no money, take the night pearl to pay off the debt

41
00:01:30.366 --> 00:01:31.766
Don't you like this dung bucket?

42
00:01:31.766 --> 00:01:32.766
Take it home

43
00:01:32.966 --> 00:01:34.066
Eat every day

44
00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.166
Let your head be full of food

45
00:01:36.766 --> 00:01:38.066
I really don't know the goods.

46
00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.966
The baby here is worth the old nose money

47
00:01:40.966 --> 00:01:42.466
Take the night pearl for exchange.

48
00:01:42.466 --> 00:01:43.900
I made a lot of money.

49
00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.066
Change it if you want.
