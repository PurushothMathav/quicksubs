00:00:01.133 --> 00:00:03.966
Everyone is here, almost

2
00:00:04.366 --> 00:00:07.366
The entire voyage of antiques has come

3
00:00:07.366 --> 00:00:10.600
Angel, why don't you gamble this time?

4
00:00:10.766 --> 00:00:12.633
Do you want to get rid of the clam beads?

5
00:00:12.966 --> 00:00:14.766
What is the difficulty of gambling on stones?

6
00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:16.766
You can see it at a glance

7
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.566
Stick beads are from the sea

8
00:00:18.766 --> 00:00:20.000
Little human contact

9
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.866
Only such a game

10
00:00:22.166 --> 00:00:24.500
To see their eyesight

11
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.633
The Heavenly Master is indeed the Heavenly Master

12
00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:31.033
Gao, the kid who cursed me to death

13
00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:32.400
He didn't come

14
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.233
He has been banned, why do you think so, haha.

15
00:00:40.666 --> 00:00:42.400
This kid actually came

16
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.666
What wow

17
00:00:46.266 --> 00:00:48.200
As expected of the conference held by Chen Tianshi

18
00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.100
The clams here are all thousands of years old

19
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.700
They're all worth a lot.

20
00:00:52.533 --> 00:00:53.800
Come come come

21
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.166
Journalist friends

22
00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:59.300
Remember this face in white.

23
00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.566
He was Chen Tianshi who blocked that bridge

24
00:01:02.566 --> 00:01:05.433
A piece of trash who eats soft rice?

25
00:01:05.533 --> 00:01:08.900
Now he is being taken care of by Miss Feng and is being used as a dog for him

26
00:01:09.166 --> 00:01:10.333
Hmph

27
00:01:10.333 --> 00:01:11.966
Are the rumors about you and Qiao Liang true?

28
00:01:11.966 --> 00:01:12.166
Qiao Liang

29
00:01:12.166 --> 00:01:13.933
Are the rumors that you were taken care of by Miss Feng true?

30
00:01:13.933 --> 00:01:15.566
Qiao Liang, weren't you banned by Chen Tianzhi?

31
00:01:15.566 --> 00:01:17.300
How dare you come here?

32
00:01:17.666 --> 00:01:18.466
Go aside

33
00:01:19.466 --> 00:01:21.833
Wang Xiang, don't talk nonsense

34
00:01:22.666 --> 00:01:24.433
We are just an ordinary teacher-student relationship

35
00:01:24.466 --> 00:01:25.666
You two

36
00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.866
The butthole wasn't wiped clean, was it?

37
00:01:28.866 --> 00:01:30.033
Can't see emotions clearly?

38
00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:31.766
What are you doing with so many captains?

39
00:01:31.766 --> 00:01:34.866
Why do you say nice and call you Brother Tiger?

40
00:01:34.866 --> 00:01:36.433
Say something bad

41
00:01:36.866 --> 00:01:39.633
There's no reason we're here today.

42
00:01:39.666 --> 00:01:40.800
I'm curious

43
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.966
This person is a trash who was banned by Chen Tianshi

44
00:01:44.966 --> 00:01:46.066
Why can I today?

45
00:01:46.066 --> 00:01:47.766
Come to this venue swaggering

46
00:01:47.766 --> 00:01:49.800
Stand still today

47
00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.400
I just want him to be ruined

48
00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.166
Bridge, why don't we go back first?

49
00:01:55.166 --> 00:01:56.466
And here I am today.

50
00:01:56.566 --> 00:01:59.533
Not going anywhere, it's not that you're crazy, you're dying

51
00:01:59.533 --> 00:02:01.433
This is the opening clam conference

52
00:02:01.533 --> 00:02:03.233
Anyone who comes in can participate

53
00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:07.200
I'm going to do it in front of all of you today.

54
00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.033
Open the largest judge
