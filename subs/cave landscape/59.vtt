00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:02.033
What did you do to my father?

2
00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:04.666
We didn't do anything.

3
00:00:04.933 --> 00:00:06.766
They insulted me.

4
00:00:06.766 --> 00:00:09.000
My father is like this, and you are still quibbling

5
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:10.966
My father is a good man

6
00:00:10.966 --> 00:00:12.666
Talking and reasonable

7
00:00:12.666 --> 00:00:14.000
How is your father?

8
00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:15.766
Let me take a look for you.

9
00:00:20.466 --> 00:00:22.666
Hmm, isn't that good?

10
00:00:22.666 --> 00:00:25.033
It's healthy, but it looks like it

11
00:00:25.866 --> 00:00:27.800
Expose their light

12
00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.566
Good family

13
00:00:29.566 --> 00:00:32.266
My father is such a good person and was bullied like this by them

14
00:00:32.266 --> 00:00:34.466
What do you think I should do?

15
00:00:34.466 --> 00:00:38.300
Call the police and let them come to the door, Brother Huang

16
00:00:38.766 --> 00:00:40.666
Is it redundant?

17
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:42.500
What do we do?

18
00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:43.800
More and more people

19
00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.966
It's okay, he's pretending here. You said my father was pretending

20
00:00:47.966 --> 00:00:49.600
I don't want your face anymore.

21
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.300
How could my father pretend at such an old age?

22
00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:54.033
Besides, what's in it for him to pretend?

23
00:00:54.066 --> 00:00:54.866
Humph

24
00:00:55.366 --> 00:00:58.566
Your father brought me a counterfeit, and I found out

25
00:00:58.566 --> 00:00:59.566
So

26
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.766
He pretends to be sick to scare people, you say it's fake

27
00:01:02.766 --> 00:01:05.666
This is the treasure that Master Qin personally identified.

28
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.566
This is the treasure of the Tang Dynasty

29
00:01:07.933 --> 00:01:10.100
Then Master Qin said it was true, you sold it to Master Qin?

30
00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:11.400
What are you doing here?

31
00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.566
My father sold it to you for you

32
00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.200
To save your fallen soul

33
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.566
My father is 8080

34
00:01:18.566 --> 00:01:21.100
How could you lie at such an old age?

35
00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:22.733
My father has been kind all his life

36
00:01:22.733 --> 00:01:24.000
I'm pissed off by you

37
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.766
But the treasures of this thing are in the museum. Hmm

38
00:01:27.066 --> 00:01:30.700
The one in the museum took me as a fake me

39
00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.666
This is the real one.

40
00:01:33.866 --> 00:01:37.100
You are awesome dad
