00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.500
Sister, I have a gambling debt outside

2
00:00:02.566 --> 00:00:04.066
They said if I didn't pay them back

3
00:00:04.066 --> 00:00:05.266
Cut off my hand

4
00:00:05.266 --> 00:00:06.900
I can't help it either.

5
00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:08.800
Misfortune

6
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.200
How could I have a brother like you?

7
00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:12.400
From today onwards

8
00:00:12.533 --> 00:00:13.566
You don't have to come back to the store.

9
00:00:13.566 --> 00:00:14.933
Go home and reflect on it

10
00:00:14.933 --> 00:00:16.966
Ok you wait for me

11
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.066
Wait a minute, put things in the box for me

12
00:00:26.466 --> 00:00:27.500
So disgusting

13
00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:29.566
Sorry bridge

14
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:32.633
I misunderstood you before.

15
00:00:32.766 --> 00:00:34.966
It's okay, Master Fang

16
00:00:35.366 --> 00:00:38.866
Can these eight sword bronzes be exchanged back to this shop?

17
00:00:38.866 --> 00:00:40.666
trabecular

18
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.433
Don't be complacent. Today is your lucky day.

19
00:00:43.533 --> 00:00:45.266
But then what?

20
00:00:45.266 --> 00:00:46.666
It's still in the sand all day long.

21
00:00:46.666 --> 00:00:49.466
You still can't make it in the antique world

22
00:00:49.466 --> 00:00:52.200
Don't worry, he won't survive today.

23
00:00:52.966 --> 00:00:54.400
What nonsense are you talking about, bro?

24
00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.900
Don't dare to say this nonsense

25
00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:57.000
Hahahaha

26
00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.100
Shao Liang, you are really crazy

27
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.300
You dare to curse me, Chen Tianshi, to death

28
00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.566
Okay, three days later, at the big game

29
00:01:03.566 --> 00:01:05.200
Do you dare to tell him yourself?

30
00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:06.000
Good idea.

31
00:01:06.766 --> 00:01:08.266
I will definitely go

32
00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:09.600
overreach

33
00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:10.766
At that time

34
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.966
I will see with my own eyes how you died

35
00:01:13.966 --> 00:01:14.766
Humph

36
00:01:34.266 --> 00:01:35.433
I'm taking a shower.

37
00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:36.833
What are you doing?

38
00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:42.766
take a shower

39
00:01:43.966 --> 00:01:45.466
Send a photo to see.

40
00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:47.200
Think beautifully

41
00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.100
I want to see people take a shower before I see them

42
00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:52.233
Your words don't count

43
00:01:52.466 --> 00:01:54.800
I said several times that I wanted to meet, but I didn't see it.

44
00:01:55.966 --> 00:01:57.300
The club is over

45
00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.200
I can give you a chance to meet me.

46
00:02:00.333 --> 00:02:02.600
Ah, what a coincidence
