00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:02.166
Okay, you arrogant, domineering brat.

2
00:00:02.166 --> 00:00:03.133
Master Bai

3
00:00:03.133 --> 00:00:05.800
Our Qin Ye has given face to the Foot Heavenly Master

4
00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:08.533
But this kid is too ignorant of praise

5
00:00:08.533 --> 00:00:11.933
I will definitely tell Qin Ye the truth when I go back

6
00:00:11.933 --> 00:00:13.000
Hey, don't

7
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:13.733
Mrs. Qin

8
00:00:13.733 --> 00:00:16.066
Let's discuss it again. What's there to discuss?

9
00:00:16.066 --> 00:00:17.700
The meaning is already clear

10
00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:20.300
This kid looks down on Qin Ye

11
00:00:20.533 --> 00:00:21.766
Unwilling to cooperate

12
00:00:21.766 --> 00:00:24.033
No, no, no bridge, that's not what he meant.

13
00:00:24.666 --> 00:00:26.600
Who said I didn't mean that?

14
00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:27.933
I'll tell you what.

15
00:00:27.933 --> 00:00:30.166
There is no such truth in the world

16
00:00:30.166 --> 00:00:33.733
I'm here to make money, and I have to hand it over to others?

17
00:00:33.733 --> 00:00:35.733
That's the rule.

18
00:00:35.733 --> 00:00:37.200
Lao Tzu's rules are the rules

19
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.666
Ok you brat

20
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.700
You have a master waiting for me

21
00:00:41.366 --> 00:00:42.166
get out of the way

22
00:00:43.966 --> 00:00:44.800
Oh, dear.

23
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.966
Pregnant and still smelly

24
00:00:52.133 --> 00:00:54.600
This broken gas should be on Uncle Feng Jing

25
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.000
Why is it with him?

26
00:00:56.066 --> 00:00:56.966
Could it be

27
00:00:57.666 --> 00:00:58.700
Two people have a leg

28
00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.000
Bridge, what are you doing?

29
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.366
You offended Qin Ye

30
00:01:02.366 --> 00:01:03.933
How can you still open this store?

31
00:01:03.933 --> 00:01:06.200
I don't believe that Qin Ye can cover the sky with one hand

32
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.566
I have asked Brother Hu to help me make a batch of porcelain

33
00:01:08.566 --> 00:01:10.566
As long as this batch of porcelain is on the market

34
00:01:10.766 --> 00:01:12.800
It's going to be very popular.

35
00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.166
You oh oh

36
00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:19.833
It's all vulgar

37
00:01:19.933 --> 00:01:23.800
None of the trash can be seen

38
00:01:30.366 --> 00:01:31.433
New Year's Eve Dinner

39
00:01:31.966 --> 00:01:33.466
It's my birthday party

40
00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.366
I want to get a baby

41
00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.066
As the finale

42
00:01:38.066 --> 00:01:40.400
There's not a single decent one now.

43
00:01:40.566 --> 00:01:44.200
Is Tangcheng at this level?

44
00:01:44.333 --> 00:01:46.300
Take it easy tonight

45
00:01:46.333 --> 00:01:47.766
I have a baby

46
00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.466
Please take a look to see if it suits you.

47
00:01:51.466 --> 00:01:54.333
It's not trash again, is it?

48
00:01:54.333 --> 00:01:57.700
Definitely not a top product

49
00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.566
There is no word excellent here

50
00:02:02.166 --> 00:02:03.033
What!

51
00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:07.633
Here it is.

52
00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.166
A long-lost iron soul
