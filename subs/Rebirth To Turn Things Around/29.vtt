00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.040
Fortunately, Jay Chou is gone.

2
00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:06.260
Jay Chou, that young man Xiao Ming is leading the way, right?

3
00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:09.720
There is nothing wrong with Han's screen. Since Jay Chou has to spend two hundred dollars on it,

4
00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:13.330
It's just a mud wall with better luck.

5
00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:15.990
I want to trample him under my feet

6
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:21.330
Someone almost caused the judge Kun Yi to suffer for a long time, and some people are shouting here

7
00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:29.660
Well, I have no choice but to see the wooden cow?

8
00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:31.450
No, Lu Shi's phone went down just now.

9
00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.830
Brother Lin is here. Brother Lin has been in Haiche recently but he got up tomorrow.

10
00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.520
Wash that expensive ice. I've prepared the position for you.

11
00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.900
Let our Haizhou store colleagues

12
00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:53.180
A fan from an old place would be fine, right?

13
00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.180
Zhou Dongâ€™s good work has blessed my soul

14
00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:56.820
But I'm not leaving now

15
00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:58.170
Wait wait wait

16
00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.730
I heard that Li Laodi

17
00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:01.890
In our company

18
00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:04.790
The main focus is on the Internet business

19
00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:06.960
I'm also interested in this

20
00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:08.740
how did you know

21
00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.540
Now there is no bridge with different winds

22
00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:13.280
What does it actually mean

23
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.040
Ruthless and mean-spirited

24
00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:18.010
Those who stay stay for money

25
00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:20.670
Even your body and experience are fine, right?

26
00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.590
Is there anything else that cannot be sold?
