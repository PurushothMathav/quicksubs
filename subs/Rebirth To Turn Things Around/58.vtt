00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:02.780
What happened at Gaoting station again in the previous life,

2
00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:05.230
There should still be one in a year.

3
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.540
I guess,

4
00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:10.360
Even if we don’t see Gaoting Station,

5
00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:12.240
See the resident or commercial bureau,

6
00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:14.830
When there should be work,

7
00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:15.410
I was right.

8
00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.400
What are you doing here so late? Oh,

9
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.480
That doesn't seem to be the case. You can just take some medicine.

10
00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:23.680
I held and moldy.

11
00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:26.850
Sister Hong, when you look at Zhou Lai,

12
00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:27.840
In fact, you can give it so much.

13
00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:30.140
Of course,

14
00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:32.140
The more the group is praised, the better it develops.

15
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.680
I won't do it until the fall.

16
00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:40.600
Sister Hong, our ordering ginseng and taking a taxi go hand in hand.

17
00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.730
Now it is closed in every city in China.

18
00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.010
There are 12 million letters a month on paper alone

19
00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:48.670
According to this stone, we will seal our head

20
00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.070
Will be ready for the test soon

21
00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:53.200
By then you have collected the soul bones of forty of a hundred people.

22
00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:54.130
But that was before

23
00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:59.770
Yes, that's more. Let's go.

24
00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:01.030
I'll take you home

25
00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:07.920
Okay, look at my machine gun

26
00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:09.180
I pull the bag for you again

27
00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:15.380
Why are you leaving me like this?

28
00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:18.870
Sister, I won’t eat this from you.

29
00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:22.590
Stewardess, do you have anything to say to me?
