00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.760
Dad, how can you let Li Feng, a waste of money, be thought to be a good speaker?

2
00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:06.010
Do you know what he did to me?

3
00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:11.750
You still have the nerve to say that you have forgotten my old company, Dad!

4
00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:15.490
Don't save my dad. How come the Zhou family has such a waste like you?

5
00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.070
Now Li Feng is getting along with you, what invitation?

6
00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.250
And is there any way for our Zhou family to survive?

7
00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:24.950
I haven’t rested, Li Feng,

8
00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:27.560
This time I became the president, but...

9
00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:30.270
I haven't rested. What are you doing?

10
00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:35.150
I have nothing to say. I have given you the position of president.

11
00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.820
You can still throw it away, what kind of invitation does he have?

12
00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.120
Both of them are not as old as you.

13
00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:43.820
Isn’t it Feiwu that you brought with you? I’ll take a look.

14
00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:47.250
Our cooperation needs to be continued

15
00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.370
Wan Ming said you can't leave

16
00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:50.290
If you leave

17
00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:53.990
Our Zhou family is completely finished.

18
00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.740
What do you want father?

19
00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:58.380
It was the two of us who killed him together.

20
00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:00.460
If Lian Feng picks up again

21
00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:04.780
You can't take it off either, so why not take it off?

22
00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:06.740
Then you say it

23
00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.820
What's wrong with you, Ling Feng?

24
00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:11.030
The problem is

25
00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.020
Before this spiritual blessing came to the sea,

26
00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:16.900
Just a brother and girlfriend

27
00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:18.260
man with spirit hat

28
00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.360
I sent several teams to check

29
00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.680
I've never found anything unusual.

30
00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:23.880
no problem

31
00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.920
is the biggest problem
