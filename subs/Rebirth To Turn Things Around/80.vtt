00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.680
If I become like this, it's not because of you.

2
00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:06.150
If it weren't for the proposal scene in your brain,

3
00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:08.630
I wonâ€™t become what everyone calls a brainy person.

4
00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:12.030
After all these years, it makes no sense for any company to use me.

5
00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:13.270
Family members also lost contact.

6
00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:15.350
You know it's almost too hot to kill the streets,

7
00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:18.170
What does it feel like? You can save yourself by eating delicious food.

8
00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.520
When I was young, I could theoretically look at my appearance, but my lighting skills were a little inferior to yours.

9
00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:25.120
Why why?

10
00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.100
Why does Miss God fall in love with you?

11
00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:30.380
Why can you purchase food and education from Pipi?

12
00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:31.020
Get to know typhoons.

13
00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:34.000
Why do you have to be the venue?

14
00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.120
Because we are always prepared when we have the opportunity.

15
00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.420
If I didn't work so hard

16
00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.320
How could there be an opportunity today?

17
00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:42.780
you get now

18
00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.100
Of course I can talk about these styles.

19
00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.700
And you know my family's block

20
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.220
How much did you sacrifice?

21
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.180
Your inhuman torture and test

22
00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.100
Now I want to think about the space for Duojue

23
00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:56.350
But when I fight Nian Nianxi

24
00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:00.760
I think it's all worth stopping

25
00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:02.570
Things that make you melt

26
00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:03.770
You're crazy for looking for fans
