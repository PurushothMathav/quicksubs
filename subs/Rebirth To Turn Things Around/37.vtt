00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:02.550
Chairman of Accounts Bureau, what do you mean?

2
00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:05.640
I took this video first by accident,

3
00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:08.310
And it was approved by Director Jay Chou,

4
00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:09.800
How can this be of use to me?

5
00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.020
Then you can't either, Mr. Accountant,

6
00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.500
This is my private matter.

7
00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:17.640
I will definitely find him alone in the future,

8
00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:18.720
Escape from the law.

9
00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:24.470
Well, I'll be waiting for Jay Chou to spend all his money at Linfengjituan any time.

10
00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:27.680
President I continues, one point,

11
00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:29.100
You write about the stage.

12
00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.030
Have you seen Zhou Tianci's temporary seal? It's hard to eat but still uncomfortable.

13
00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:41.080
Go back and close the video

14
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:44.880
Please remove it from them next time

15
00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:46.960
This was once a bad thing

16
00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:51.890
Is this bad guy a free bad guy?

17
00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:53.050
What Zhang Wenming said

18
00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:54.550
What's going on with electing the president?

19
00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:56.990
Sister Haizhoushan, all brothers Lin Li

20
00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:58.110
avoid vicious competition

21
00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:59.890
We will choose someone with outstanding abilities

22
00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:00.830
serve as president

23
00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:02.310
Then take everyone with you

24
00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:04.250
Integrate resources and develop together

25
00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:07.960
The president will also provide some conveniences to my father.

26
00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.580
That's the former president

27
00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:11.750
The president is so kind to Jing

28
00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:13.660
After seeing it, I must organize it

29
00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:16.310
It’s the president’s rigidity

30
00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:18.690
He also talked about the strength of Yishenshi

31
00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.680
There should be something to consider, the president

32
00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:23.580
But consider asking for younger ones

33
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:26.920
And since I have no experience with the same injury, I suggest

34
00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.400
By Chu Tianci, Jay Chou

35
00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.240
But we will meet each other around the president

36
00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:32.100
How about
