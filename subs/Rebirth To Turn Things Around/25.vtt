00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.460
Didn't you get over this matter long ago?

2
00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:10.710
And how did you know you would be detained?

3
00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:12.030
Let me explain it to you this way.

4
00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:15.430
I have been looking for him on the sea since I was little.

5
00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:19.810
Is there a typhoon? I will know as soon as I make this payment.

6
00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:23.160
Let me briefly describe it.

7
00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:26.870
Until your brother gets well.

8
00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.730
I made a monthly bet with you out of anger.

9
00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:34.200
It really shouldn’t be. I’m going to choose him.

10
00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.660
That doesn't matter anymore.

11
00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:41.100
Where did this old pine come from?

12
00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:43.130
Why is he so cheeky?

13
00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:46.830
Yunfeng, my dad is being polite to you.

14
00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:47.730
To give you face

15
00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:49.550
Don't give it to you, don't want you

16
00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:51.750
Zhou Hao, you guys use it

17
00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.590
The name of the judge is written on the horse head picture

18
00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:54.630
Goods with three meanings

19
00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.300
Since this typhoon

20
00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.000
I guess you can't even check it

21
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.360
There's nothing to lose, right?

22
00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.840
I'm afraid how do you know Jay Chou?

23
00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:04.680
Trial never designed a navy

24
00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:06.700
Where did this Sanyi stuff come from?

25
00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:08.430
Has it been used?

26
00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:10.700
The funds on the certificate are what?

27
00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.360
How can you talk nonsense

28
00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.250
That's the solution, right?

29
00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.210
Don't listen to Mr.

30
00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.650
Nonsense, we definitely haven’t allocated enough funds to anyone.

31
00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.340
Space, give me the remaining Zangkou and take it out
