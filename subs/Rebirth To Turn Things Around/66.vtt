00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:01.930
Tianfeng Group loses the grass,

2
00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:07.680
As far as I know, none of the top executives of Tianfeng Group are happy.

3
00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:10.030
I beg you to act like you don’t know anything,

4
00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:13.420
The Forget Group is the first group in the sea,

5
00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.100
Can the higher-ups let you know casually?

6
00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:21.140
Then live with you, and become, as soon as possible, Mrs. Habit.

7
00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:25.430
Thank you everyone for your unearned kindness.

8
00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:28.960
Oh, by the way, do you want to have dinner together?

9
00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:32.470
Let me check the time? Oops

10
00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:34.130
My dear

11
00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:35.650
He and I forget time

12
00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:37.160
Why don't you buy this for me?

13
00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:38.720
All-special hand cakes

14
00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:41.390
I don't understand this thing either

15
00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:42.760
Seems like the cheapest

16
00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.810
It must be hundreds of thousands, right? A Mingfang

17
00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:48.270
Your company has been in business for decades

18
00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:51.450
You can't afford this watch, right?

19
00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:53.180
This is all small money

20
00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.060
As long as you don't want to

21
00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.820
I’ll buy you A Ming Fang for everything.

22
00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:00.180
I didn't say that

23
00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:02.950
You can't afford a dress here

24
00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:04.849
I can’t afford a watch

25
00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:09.820
Isn’t this boring job hunting?

26
00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:16.080
Did Wujie abandon you? No, Wujie?

27
00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.140
My son Rouhua

28
00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.460
What kind of man can’t be found?

29
00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.680
Boring like you

30
00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:24.650
It must be boring

31
00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:28.820
If you say it's boring, it's boring. It's you.

32
00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.880
This is beyond the reach of such a thief

33
00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:34.380
It's really interesting

34
00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:38.210
My dear

35
00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:39.190
When swiping the card

36
00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:41.070
I won't even look at you

37
00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:43.020
Young and warm

38
00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.580
But I'm still thoughtful enough to burn a sum of money today.

39
00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.740
I really can't compare to this

40
00:01:54.100 --> 00:02:00.090
It’s not always the case that you are really being bullied and responsible.

41
00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:04.520
Are there people who are willing to move me to buy it?
