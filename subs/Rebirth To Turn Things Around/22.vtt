1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
No, you are really right. God will give me disaster.

2
00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:10.330
God sends you money

3
00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:12.790
The entire working capital is only 1.5 billion.

4
00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:14.970
You said you can move most of your funds

5
00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:17.170
Even if God comes

6
00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:18.130
I won’t talk about you either.

7
00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:20.200
Don’t you believe it yet?

8
00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.210
God really won't give me any trouble

9
00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:24.450
And you draw lots

10
00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:25.490
At least give me Zed.

11
00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:30.670
I think you died to a fraction of the time

12
00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:31.690
All that's left is to be tough-mouthed, right?

13
00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:35.230
Is it better to be a closed person or to be raised?

14
00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:37.060
Wait until you go underground

15
00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:39.860
I'll tell you the car number

16
00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:42.590
You talk too much and talk too much

17
00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:44.690
It's time

18
00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:45.730
Do you still believe him?

19
00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:47.870
There's not a word of testimony in this kid's mouth

20
00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:49.930
If Mr. Shen doesn't help me, why should he help you?

21
00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:51.410
A short appointment of ten days away

22
00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:52.610
There are still a few hours

23
00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:55.740
Is it time from one to eleven?

24
00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.280
I see what are you talking about?

25
00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.560
Before the eleventh short contract

26
00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:07.630
I believe everyone sees the same thing

27
00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.310
But it’s a maritime map

28
00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:12.270
But now I say

29
00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.150
This is Haizhongchang Zhufen

30
00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:19.000
I have rented 90% of the 70 kilometers of sea area

31
00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.500
Secondly, everyone turns on their mobile phones to look at you.

32
00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.460
Ten minutes ago Seven Crosses in the Sea

33
00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:33.930
Not like this
