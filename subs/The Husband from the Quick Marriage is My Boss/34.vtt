00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:01.366
No no no no no

2
00:00:01.366 --> 00:00:03.700
Not step down from the position of manager

3
00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:06.833
It's that you voluntarily get out of this company

4
00:00:08.166 --> 00:00:09.366
3 days later

5
00:00:09.366 --> 00:00:12.100
He's going to a business-style private dinner

6
00:00:12.666 --> 00:00:14.566
Ordinary people can't get in at all

7
00:00:15.533 --> 00:00:18.900
How can I reach him?

8
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.266
Siyan, why are you here?

9
00:00:27.366 --> 00:00:29.566
Well, why don't you go back first?

10
00:00:29.566 --> 00:00:30.766
I still have to work overtime

11
00:00:30.766 --> 00:00:31.900
Don't wait for me.

12
00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:32.300
You forgot

13
00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:34.500
I made an appointment with the parents of both parties for dinner tonight

14
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.266
Ah, it's over.

15
00:00:36.566 --> 00:00:39.500
I forgot it's alright I've been delayed for an hour

16
00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.000
Did it scare you in the morning?

17
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.566
Morning, you said the president will do that

18
00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:47.333
Well, I just think he's cruel.

19
00:00:47.333 --> 00:00:48.866
I don't think you're scary.

20
00:00:49.366 --> 00:00:50.766
It turns out that doing things is real

21
00:00:52.166 --> 00:00:52.966
of

22
00:00:56.666 --> 00:00:57.500
How come?

23
00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.600
It's because of your promotion

24
00:00:59.666 --> 00:01:00.900
Are they talking about you behind your back?

25
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:02.233
That's how they are

26
00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:03.800
He asked me to rely on a mouth

27
00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.100
Just ignore them.

28
00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:05.900
No way.

29
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:07.500
No, don't get me wrong.

30
00:01:08.333 --> 00:01:10.100
Hey don't

31
00:01:10.133 --> 00:01:13.333
As for this matter, I actually already have a solution

32
00:01:13.333 --> 00:01:16.800
Although he has such a small difficulty

33
00:01:17.366 --> 00:01:18.100
But

34
00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.500
I really need your help with one thing

35
00:01:20.533 --> 00:01:22.466
After three days

36
00:01:22.466 --> 00:01:24.533
President Lu has a business career

37
00:01:24.533 --> 00:01:25.933
That private dinner

38
00:01:25.933 --> 00:01:29.000
I don't know if there's any way you can dream

39
00:01:29.133 --> 00:01:31.233
Look, don't worry.

40
00:01:31.333 --> 00:01:34.233
I'm the assistant of the boss.

41
00:01:34.466 --> 00:01:36.066
This ability is still yours

42
00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:37.533
Colleague give up

43
00:01:37.533 --> 00:01:39.100
Husband, you are amazing
