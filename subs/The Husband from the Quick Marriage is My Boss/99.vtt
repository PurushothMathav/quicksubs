00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:02.900
President, I am going to have a wedding in October tomorrow.

2
00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:04.766
Do you have time to come over?

3
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.600
Now a big round of applause.

4
00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:15.666
Welcome our bride and groom

5
00:00:35.333 --> 00:00:37.400
I fantasized about our wedding countless times

6
00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:38.666
But think about it

7
00:00:38.933 --> 00:00:40.666
I think unforgettable is the most important thing

8
00:00:41.366 --> 00:00:43.766
That's why I asked the two of them to cooperate with me in that scene

9
00:00:43.966 --> 00:00:45.300
Give you the most unforgettable marriage

10
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:49.700
starring

11
00:00:50.066 --> 00:00:53.066
Would you like to spend a lifetime with me and grow old together?

12
00:01:01.166 --> 00:01:03.433
Oh, when are you going to get married?

13
00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:05.166
Are we familiar?

14
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.066
I don't know him.

15
00:01:07.066 --> 00:01:08.166
Neither are you

16
00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.166
I'm not planning to get married yet.

17
00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.100
Give it to you, I don't want it either.

18
00:01:17.366 --> 00:01:20.766
If you two don't get married, where will I get married?
