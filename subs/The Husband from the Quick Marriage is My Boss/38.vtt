1
00:00:00.533 --> 00:00:04.033
So the woman your dad can't forget

2
00:00:04.533 --> 00:00:06.166
Could it be my mom?

3
00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:07.766
It's no use guessing

4
00:00:07.766 --> 00:00:11.066
Tomorrow, I will cooperate with my mother's acting process first

5
00:00:11.166 --> 00:00:13.400
Go to the old house and go to my dad's study

6
00:00:13.533 --> 00:00:16.300
See if there are any clues

7
00:00:19.066 --> 00:00:21.500
Well, let me tell you something.

8
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.300
We have now received the certificate.

9
00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:24.800
Even if you go on a blind date

10
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.566
What is more beautiful to meet?

11
00:00:26.566 --> 00:00:27.966
Better home

12
00:00:28.066 --> 00:00:29.600
You have no chance

13
00:00:34.066 --> 00:00:35.100
fool

14
00:00:35.766 --> 00:00:38.766
If you like to be more beautiful than you and have a better family than you

15
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.633
It won't wait from three years ago to now

16
00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:46.166
Vice President?

17
00:00:46.166 --> 00:00:49.200
I didn't expect us to be like this again

18
00:00:49.366 --> 00:00:52.066
Why are you here to replace the vice president on a blind date?

19
00:00:52.066 --> 00:00:53.100
Since we all know

20
00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.500
So let's get straight to the point.

21
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.200
You want money I can give you money

22
00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:57.666
But marriage is impossible

23
00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.200
Tell him when you see my mom

24
00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:01.700
I don't like married people

25
00:01:03.133 --> 00:01:04.000
What married?

26
00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.600
You are the real vice president
