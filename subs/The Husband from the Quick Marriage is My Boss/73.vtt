00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:01.300
I need to talk to you.

2
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:09.833
I miss you so much!

3
00:00:11.566 --> 00:00:13.366
Don't be glib

4
00:00:13.366 --> 00:00:14.533
Did you tell my mom

5
00:00:14.533 --> 00:00:16.600
That's why he came here, right?

6
00:00:19.333 --> 00:00:21.266
My mom's knot is long overdue

7
00:00:21.533 --> 00:00:24.166
So the best way is to say it in person

8
00:00:24.566 --> 00:00:25.700
Let me go

9
00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:27.400
Don't forget our current relationship

10
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:30.966
And who knows if you've ever hugged like this in October

11
00:00:31.966 --> 00:00:34.300
Contented so I was outside the office before

12
00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.100
He stared at my aunt and said

13
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.466
Okay, right?

14
00:00:37.466 --> 00:00:40.200
I'm afraid that your acting will evolve and suddenly take over

15
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.400
I wouldn't.

16
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.800
But I see you're hugging Luscio's arm

17
00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:44.500
It's natural to hug

18
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:45.700
No heart at all

19
00:00:47.066 --> 00:00:49.566
And you flirted with that mall

20
00:00:49.566 --> 00:00:50.933
I'm jealous

21
00:00:50.933 --> 00:00:53.866
Okay, now is not the time to discuss this

22
00:00:53.866 --> 00:00:55.800
Wait until our plan is over

23
00:00:56.666 --> 00:01:00.333
I found you, let your mother and my mother be in-laws

24
00:01:00.333 --> 00:01:01.133
Dad?

25
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.266
What are you doing here?

26
00:01:09.566 --> 00:01:13.433
Come out here and welcome me to tell you

27
00:01:14.333 --> 00:01:15.600
I'm pregnant.

28
00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:18.000
Unemployed child

29
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.966
What? I have a grandson!
