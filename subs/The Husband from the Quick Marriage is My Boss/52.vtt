00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:02.566
It turns out that I have always been wrong about you

2
00:00:02.566 --> 00:00:04.766
Alienation must wait for me

3
00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:09.100
I really can't drink anymore

4
00:00:11.166 --> 00:00:13.400
Ouch blame me blame me blame me

5
00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.133
Mr. Lu hasn't enjoyed it yet

6
00:00:15.133 --> 00:00:16.566
Why do I want to get started?

7
00:00:16.566 --> 00:00:18.900
Oh, blame me, blame me too.

8
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.100
Wait until Mr. Lu gets tired of playing

9
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.166
Throw it to yourself

10
00:00:21.166 --> 00:00:23.066
Is it okay to taste it?

11
00:00:25.166 --> 00:00:26.466
I won't sign the contract

12
00:00:26.466 --> 00:00:27.800
I'm not going to talk about the project.

13
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.700
Luo Qixiu, not only how can you bully people?

14
00:00:32.266 --> 00:00:33.500
Want to go now

15
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:35.900
Not yet

16
00:00:36.466 --> 00:00:37.666
I'm already married.

17
00:00:37.666 --> 00:00:40.166
I advise you to let go of me if you don't

18
00:00:46.866 --> 00:00:48.866
You beast let me go

19
00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:51.900
Wow

20
00:00:53.133 --> 00:00:54.100
Vice President, why are you here?

21
00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:54.800
Why are you here?

22
00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.000
From today onwards

23
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.366
I'm going to make their industry disappear completely

24
00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:59.766
As for the dew

25
00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:01.766
Worse all night

26
00:01:01.933 --> 00:01:03.600
Smoking is still capable

27
00:01:04.133 --> 00:01:05.700
I actually bumped into you

28
00:01:09.333 --> 00:01:12.366
Mr. Lu, what you have to worry about now

29
00:01:12.366 --> 00:01:14.600
It should be that Lu Enterprises is at risk of divestment
