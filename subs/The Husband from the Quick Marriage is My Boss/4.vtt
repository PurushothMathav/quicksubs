1
00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:01.066
I choose

2
00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:04.800
I choose him.

3
00:00:07.933 --> 00:00:09.200
See you.

4
00:00:12.966 --> 00:00:16.266
Sooner or later, I will get you out of this company

5
00:00:16.266 --> 00:00:17.433
Get out of here!

6
00:00:19.933 --> 00:00:21.533
Aren't you afraid that he will fire you?

7
00:00:21.533 --> 00:00:23.133
Of course I'm scared

8
00:00:23.133 --> 00:00:25.433
But I'm more afraid of him humiliating you.

9
00:00:26.666 --> 00:00:28.533
Calm down, woman from three years ago

10
00:00:28.533 --> 00:00:30.133
Not humiliated me in the same way

11
00:00:30.133 --> 00:00:31.333
Now that you are married

12
00:00:31.333 --> 00:00:33.300
Should we live together?

13
00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.300
I'll be waiting for you tonight, Building 6, Lake Heart Villa.

14
00:00:37.066 --> 00:00:38.300
You dare not

15
00:00:39.066 --> 00:00:42.400
You can't really be taken care of, can you?

16
00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.366
Assistants shouldn't be able to afford it.

17
00:00:44.766 --> 00:00:46.166
Wuxin Villa

18
00:00:46.166 --> 00:00:47.400
No, he has gone abroad.

19
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.100
Cheap rent

20
00:00:50.466 --> 00:00:52.400
All right. See you tonight

21
00:00:53.366 --> 00:00:54.766
See you.

22
00:00:55.933 --> 00:00:57.833
Oh, dear.

23
00:00:58.466 --> 00:01:01.166
Want to climb into his bed so soon?

24
00:01:01.166 --> 00:01:04.000
You earn 3,000 a month my little assistant

25
00:01:04.533 --> 00:01:07.066
I don't think you want to keep him

26
00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:08.933
I want him to take care of you

27
00:01:08.933 --> 00:01:11.766
Mr. Shi, this is my personal matter

28
00:01:11.766 --> 00:01:13.433
It should be about you

29
00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.800
You don't have to go to the Villa of Hearts tonight

30
00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:16.966
Tonight.

31
00:01:16.966 --> 00:01:19.566
I will help the big boss throw a welcome party

32
00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.900
All the leaders in the company will go

33
00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.166
But what a pity

34
00:01:23.166 --> 00:01:24.466
I have my period

35
00:01:24.466 --> 00:01:25.733
Unwell

36
00:01:25.733 --> 00:01:28.600
I can't drink that fine Moutai at all

37
00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.700
So I can only drink it instead of me?

38
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.566
Mr. Shi, I remember when I applied for the job

39
00:01:35.566 --> 00:01:37.266
My profile is very clear

40
00:01:37.266 --> 00:01:38.233
I am allergic to alcohol

41
00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.300
Even if you want to make things difficult for me

42
00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.300
You don't have to do it this way

43
00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:46.333
Can't do it, do you mean you can't do it?

44
00:01:46.333 --> 00:01:50.033
Then if you can't do it, hurry up and pack your things

45
00:01:50.066 --> 00:01:52.500
Get me out of the company
