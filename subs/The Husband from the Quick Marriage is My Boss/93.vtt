1
00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:01.833
Go back to the company and get everything ready

2
00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:05.800
Don't have to go, instead of having to turn over

3
00:00:05.933 --> 00:00:06.900
Tell all the kings

4
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:09.300
Today's meeting must apologize to all

5
00:00:11.333 --> 00:00:12.133
What's wrong with you?

6
00:00:12.133 --> 00:00:13.533
Why did the meeting suddenly advance?

7
00:00:13.533 --> 00:00:14.466
Is something wrong?

8
00:00:14.466 --> 00:00:16.200
I heard that the president is divorced

9
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.500
He gave me 10% of his shares to his ex-wife

10
00:00:18.533 --> 00:00:21.200
Now he only has 25% left

11
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.233
It seems that everyone already knows the matter

12
00:00:30.666 --> 00:00:33.166
Is everyone here?

13
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.600
Is the vice president a little too anxious?

14
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.500
A shareholder as large as me has not arrived yet

15
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:41.733
The meeting started

16
00:00:41.733 --> 00:00:44.266
Isn't this the general manager of the market entry group?

17
00:00:52.733 --> 00:00:54.466
You probably don't know it yet

18
00:00:54.866 --> 00:00:56.300
The vice president's ex-wife

19
00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:57.633
That is, Miss Shu

20
00:00:57.766 --> 00:01:00.466
Transfer his 10% stake

21
00:01:00.466 --> 00:01:01.900
It has been transferred to me.

22
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:06.166
So I am now the third generation of Fuji

23
00:01:07.066 --> 00:01:09.700
Yo, what a scumbag

24
00:01:13.266 --> 00:01:14.700
Let's start, Mr. Hu

25
00:01:22.566 --> 00:01:24.166
The reason why it was held in advance

26
00:01:24.166 --> 00:01:27.033
Because the latest invited tenders got a piece of land

27
00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.166
We redeveloped the business engine.

28
00:01:29.166 --> 00:01:31.166
You can look at the manual file

29
00:01:36.733 --> 00:01:37.633
What!
