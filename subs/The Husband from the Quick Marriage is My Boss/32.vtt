00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.066
But what has happened to you over the years?

2
00:00:02.066 --> 00:00:03.466
I would like to know.

3
00:00:05.466 --> 00:00:06.500
What's going on here?

4
00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:08.300
Why did the company appoint you to

5
00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:09.600
The position of manager for Ma

6
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:10.966
Win or lose. Win or lose.

7
00:00:10.966 --> 00:00:12.733
You are really capable

8
00:00:12.733 --> 00:00:15.833
The sound of sleeping with a man by spreading his legs

9
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.566
Auntie, let's fight

10
00:00:18.566 --> 00:00:20.066
Is it wrong?

11
00:00:20.066 --> 00:00:22.866
I really underestimated you and that little white face.

12
00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.033
It actually made Manager Ma afraid of this

13
00:00:26.866 --> 00:00:28.366
The reason why Manager Ma was fired

14
00:00:28.366 --> 00:00:30.266
It's because he did something that has no lower limit

15
00:00:30.266 --> 00:00:32.066
That's what happened today

16
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:34.566
And why did I take over the position of manager Ma?

17
00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.900
You can go to the CEO's office and ask you yourself.

18
00:00:36.933 --> 00:00:37.466
Forget it. Forget it.

19
00:00:37.466 --> 00:00:39.166
Come, come, come

20
00:00:42.733 --> 00:00:44.466
My aunt

21
00:00:44.466 --> 00:00:45.866
This uncle

22
00:00:45.866 --> 00:00:47.366
He's really different.

23
00:00:47.366 --> 00:00:49.033
Someone above him

24
00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:50.466
So what if someone is up there?

25
00:00:50.466 --> 00:00:52.966
My uncle also knows the major shareholder of Fuji

26
00:00:52.966 --> 00:00:54.200
different

27
00:00:55.933 --> 00:00:57.300
So anyway.

28
00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.766
This book can't move either

29
00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.566
That's all I can say.

30
00:01:03.566 --> 00:01:05.300
To listen or not to listen

31
00:01:05.533 --> 00:01:07.100
It's all your business

32
00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.533
Anyway, as long as there is a next time

33
00:01:09.533 --> 00:01:10.666
Go

34
00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.000
It must be you

35
00:01:15.866 --> 00:01:17.300
I can rely on the test

36
00:01:17.366 --> 00:01:18.866
Can't you press it?
