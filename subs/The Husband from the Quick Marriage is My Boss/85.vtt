They go out for a while to help you grab 10.

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:05.900
Yuan

3
00:00:27.466 --> 00:00:28.400
let go

4
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.500
Who are you nosy

5
00:00:32.566 --> 00:00:33.666
I'm his boyfriend.

6
00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.066
A boyfriend still comes out to play

7
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.966
That's really interesting.

8
00:00:37.966 --> 00:00:39.466
I'm ready to drink

9
00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:40.866
What do you say now?

10
00:00:41.733 --> 00:00:42.800
Money, right?

11
00:00:44.566 --> 00:00:45.500
That's enough!

12
00:00:46.366 --> 00:00:47.366
roll

13
00:00:55.566 --> 00:00:58.300
Are you okay? Why are you drinking so much?

14
00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:00.166
Don't say you're my boyfriend

15
00:01:00.166 --> 00:01:02.000
No matter what you do

16
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.533
I called you and you didn't answer.

17
00:01:03.533 --> 00:01:04.966
You don't reply if you send a message.

18
00:01:04.966 --> 00:01:06.866
Just a scum

19
00:01:06.866 --> 00:01:08.766
I can't find another man yet

20
00:01:08.766 --> 00:01:10.600
I didn't fail to reply to your message.

21
00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.366
I am what I am

22
00:01:12.366 --> 00:01:13.466
You just don't like me.

23
00:01:13.466 --> 00:01:15.800
That's why you're still being nice to me

24
00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.133
Why did he kiss me?

25
00:01:17.133 --> 00:01:19.700
I'm not what that is

26
00:01:20.266 --> 00:01:21.300
There's another reason.

27
00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:26.566
I've just never been in a relationship.

28
00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:30.233
I don't know how to face you

29
00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.766
I just thought then
