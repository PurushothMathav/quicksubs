00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.166
How can you guarantee that he will not betray you?

2
00:00:12.566 --> 00:00:14.600
Mr. Deputy, is there anything you want to see me about?

3
00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:16.100
Do you know who I am?

4
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:18.600
Mr. Vice said sorry directly

5
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:19.600
Don't beat around the bush

6
00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:20.200
I want to know.

7
00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.366
Estranged from what really happened 3 years ago

8
00:00:22.966 --> 00:00:24.000
Why is he now?

9
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.100
They're not paying for my mental illness.

10
00:00:26.333 --> 00:00:27.933
3 years ago was too long

11
00:00:27.933 --> 00:00:29.166
My memory's not that good.

12
00:00:29.166 --> 00:00:30.300
As for the illness

13
00:00:30.366 --> 00:00:31.100
Excuse me.

14
00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:32.800
We can't divulge anyone.

15
00:00:33.533 --> 00:00:35.133
If Mr. Fo has nothing else to do

16
00:00:35.133 --> 00:00:36.366
Please close yourself

17
00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:37.600
cut

18
00:00:38.333 --> 00:00:41.566
I thought Dr. Sang would be nice to talk to

19
00:00:42.666 --> 00:00:44.100
When it seems necessary

20
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.033
Still need some necessary means

21
00:00:49.666 --> 00:00:52.233
This is evidence that you changed your patient's medication list at will

22
00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:53.200
Three things.

23
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.800
I never do anything I'm not sure about

24
00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.200
So you'd better pay for it.

25
00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.300
Tell me everything you know.

26
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:00.600
otherwise

27
00:01:01.533 --> 00:01:05.366
If this evidence is handed over to the dean, I am afraid

28
00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:13.366
But how resplendent

29
00:01:13.366 --> 00:01:15.466
Seems like I've seen it somewhere before

30
00:01:16.933 --> 00:01:18.200
