00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:10.200
Miss Shu meets again

2
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.766
Aren't you waiting for me here?

3
00:00:11.766 --> 00:00:13.000
What else is there to escape?

4
00:00:15.766 --> 00:00:16.966
Divorced

5
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.566
If you have anything to do with me

6
00:00:19.566 --> 00:00:20.966
Let's talk somewhere else

7
00:00:20.966 --> 00:00:23.800
I don't want to be here any longer. Okay.

8
00:00:26.566 --> 00:00:27.366
Yeah.

9
00:00:28.933 --> 00:00:31.366
A new man so soon?

10
00:00:31.366 --> 00:00:33.600
I have only known Mr. Lu for a few days

11
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.100
Went on a date

12
00:00:35.366 --> 00:00:37.700
A newly divorced man is so popular

13
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.466
Not to mention single nobles like Mr. Lu

14
00:00:41.533 --> 00:00:44.033
May our marriage fall apart

15
00:00:44.266 --> 00:00:45.600
But I also don't want you to

16
00:00:45.966 --> 00:00:48.500
Have you forgotten his previous business experience?

17
00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:49.600
Think about your injuries

18
00:00:49.933 --> 00:00:52.066
That's better than the psychological trauma you caused me

19
00:00:53.133 --> 00:00:54.166
All like this

20
00:00:54.166 --> 00:00:57.000
You won't be able to stay at Fuji Group, will you?

21
00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.233
But yeah.

22
00:00:58.366 --> 00:01:00.466
A CEO as big as Mr. Lu

23
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.800
How can you not give it to your little lover?

24
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.300
Assign a position in the company

25
00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.833
I don't know what this lady does

26
00:01:08.866 --> 00:01:11.300
But Miss Shu will officially pursue

27
00:01:11.366 --> 00:01:13.366
Getting along well will be better

28
00:01:13.766 --> 00:01:14.700
You get something for nothing.

29
00:01:22.933 --> 00:01:25.200
Yotsuba, look at him

30
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.066
Wait for me.

31
00:01:30.066 --> 00:01:32.300
This will all be over soon
