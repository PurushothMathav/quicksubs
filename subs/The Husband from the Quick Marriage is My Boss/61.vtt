00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:01.466
You think about it.

2
00:00:13.366 --> 00:00:15.000
Why are you back so late today?

3
00:00:15.266 --> 00:00:17.133
It's because of the project

4
00:00:17.133 --> 00:00:18.666
Did you make things difficult for you in October?

5
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:19.700
Don't worry.

6
00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:23.000
I said no one can drive you away from Fuji

7
00:00:23.133 --> 00:00:24.366
Certainly.

8
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.266
Of course you have the right.

9
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:28.500
What's your trouble?

10
00:00:29.066 --> 00:00:30.166
Haven't eaten yet?

11
00:00:30.166 --> 00:00:32.300
I'll let you prepare dessert later. Eat first

12
00:00:32.366 --> 00:00:33.166
Fu Siyan

13
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:35.600
When are you going to lie to me?

14
00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.200
Do you think I know you are the president of Fuji?

15
00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:39.833
Will you miss your money?

16
00:00:40.133 --> 00:00:42.800
Or do you think it's good to lie to me?

17
00:00:43.166 --> 00:00:45.200
Do you want me to tell you something carefully?

18
00:00:46.566 --> 00:00:49.200
In fact, I always want to explain it to you personally

19
00:00:49.933 --> 00:00:50.866
So

20
00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:53.700
So what is all this real?

21
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.566
So you've been lying to me?

22
00:00:56.333 --> 00:00:57.900
Ok I was wrong

23
00:00:58.600 --> 00:00:59.766
I'll lie to you again.

24
00:01:01.666 --> 00:01:03.400
That's nothing to say

25
00:01:04.133 --> 00:01:06.200
Since it's all your deception

26
00:01:07.366 --> 00:01:09.433
Fu Siyan, let's get a divorce

27
00:01:11.066 --> 00:01:12.300
Have something to say

28
00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:14.100
Don't get divorced at every turn

29
00:01:15.133 --> 00:01:17.800
Okay, I finally found out about the divorce.

30
00:01:18.133 --> 00:01:19.766
You know I'm not worthy of my son, right?

31
00:01:19.766 --> 00:01:22.033
Pack up and go
