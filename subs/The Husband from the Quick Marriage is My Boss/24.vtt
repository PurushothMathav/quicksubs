1
00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:04.100
How can I send him a message?

2
00:00:04.566 --> 00:00:07.366
Is he calling to apologize to me?

3
00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:11.000
President, I have checked, there should be no typo, right?

4
00:00:14.566 --> 00:00:17.200
President, I have checked the doctor's next pen

5
00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:18.400
His name is Sang Chen

6
00:00:18.466 --> 00:00:19.733
He's a psychiatrist.

7
00:00:19.733 --> 00:00:21.600
After graduation, I went to Union Hospital

8
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.000
And he and Miss Shu should have known each other for a few years

9
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:24.600
It's time.

10
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.966
So you're trying to tell me about their relationship?

11
00:00:26.966 --> 00:00:28.033
I really don't understand.

12
00:00:28.666 --> 00:00:29.900
I dare not drive a sports car.

13
00:00:29.966 --> 00:00:32.900
But Miss Shu often goes to the hospital to find him

14
00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:34.166
Try the data.

15
00:00:34.766 --> 00:00:36.333
The nurse said what about Sang Chen?

16
00:00:36.333 --> 00:00:37.766
Often take advantage of work hours

17
00:00:37.766 --> 00:00:40.166
Go to the back garden of the hospital with Miss Shu

18
00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.600
So he didn't bring it in the senior room.

19
00:00:47.333 --> 00:00:48.666
I'll call and ask myself

20
00:00:53.966 --> 00:00:56.833
Hello, the phone you dialed is turned off.

21
00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:01.200
president

22
00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:03.400
See if you called back.

23
00:01:05.366 --> 00:01:06.266
Nope.

24
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.866
Won't go to the back garden again

25
00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.266
No, I'll take a look.
