00:00:00.733 --> 00:00:01.700
How come?

2
00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:02.966
So far.

3
00:00:03.266 --> 00:00:04.866
Mom, I'm so sorry.

4
00:00:04.866 --> 00:00:06.600
I apologize to you.

5
00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:07.733
You don't have to call me.

6
00:00:07.733 --> 00:00:09.100
I'm not your mother either.

7
00:00:10.133 --> 00:00:11.200
Start today.

8
00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:12.800
I'll get a lawyer right away

9
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.400
To walk you through the divorce process

10
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.900
I will definitely not agree with you being together.

11
00:00:17.066 --> 00:00:19.966
Mom, you have something to say

12
00:00:19.966 --> 00:00:21.800
You can always be a few minutes late because of your aunt

13
00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.066
Just be unreasonable

14
00:00:23.066 --> 00:00:24.566
What's so funny?

15
00:00:24.933 --> 00:00:26.900
I'm the one who hates not getting lost the most

16
00:00:26.966 --> 00:00:29.800
And have you forgotten how your father died?

17
00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.366
It was because the ambulance was ten minutes late

18
00:00:32.466 --> 00:00:34.033
Just came on right away

19
00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:35.666
Insurance?

20
00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.266
Why don't you send Auntie back first?

21
00:00:38.266 --> 00:00:40.066
I'll calm my mom down first

22
00:00:41.266 --> 00:00:44.766
Silently for the fact that my mother didn't arrive on time

23
00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:46.433
I apologize to you for him.

24
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:47.966
But if you are because of this

25
00:00:47.966 --> 00:00:49.566
If you want me to divorce Fu Siyi

26
00:00:49.566 --> 00:00:50.800
That's impossible.

27
00:00:50.933 --> 00:00:52.166
For marriage

28
00:00:52.166 --> 00:00:54.066
We have our own ideas.

29
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.233
They're not three-year-olds anymore.

30
00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:01.766
Then let's go back first. Let's go.

31
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.100
Mom won't let the driver take you back

32
00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:10.500
I'll let you get a divorce.

33
00:01:10.666 --> 00:01:12.700
Did you turn a deaf ear to my words?

34
00:01:13.133 --> 00:01:14.966
I want to say that a woman like you

35
00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:16.600
100 times better than him

36
00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.200
I can transfer a thousand for you to jump slowly.

37
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.366
I don't need it.

38
00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.766
Anyway, you have to go on a blind date with me tomorrow

39
00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:26.633
You don't even listen to me

40
00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:28.866
Why am I still alive?

41
00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.966
Put the knife down and I promise you
