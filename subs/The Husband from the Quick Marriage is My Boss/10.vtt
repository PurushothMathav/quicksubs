00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:01.700
Why don't you die?

2
00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:02.666
You destroyed my home

3
00:00:02.666 --> 00:00:04.266
And my dad's life's work

4
00:00:06.666 --> 00:00:09.900
Yes, it seems to be suddenly stimulated by something

5
00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:11.900
Then he fainted unconsciously

6
00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:15.466
Well, please get the doctor here ASAP.

7
00:00:17.766 --> 00:00:19.300
Although your condition has improved

8
00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:20.266
But remember

9
00:00:20.266 --> 00:00:21.200
Never drink alcohol

10
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.066
And other stimulating things

11
00:00:23.066 --> 00:00:25.333
Otherwise, it will still affect the brain nerves

12
00:00:25.333 --> 00:00:27.000
Once stimulated

13
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.766
Did all the previous efforts go to waste?

14
00:00:30.766 --> 00:00:32.000
It's not that serious

15
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.100
You just have to cooperate

16
00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:33.500
I believe you.

17
00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.366
Hold it a little longer and you'll be a normal person

18
00:00:35.366 --> 00:00:37.466
I don't have to suffer from mental illness anymore.

19
00:00:37.466 --> 00:00:39.266
Thank you, Sang Chang

20
00:00:39.333 --> 00:00:41.266
Ah, by the way, Xiaoyan, um

21
00:00:41.266 --> 00:00:42.733
You asked me about that earlier

22
00:00:42.733 --> 00:00:45.000
Why does the brain have blurry images?

23
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.366
All I can tell you is that treatment is like this

24
00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.566
He will make you choose to forget some

25
00:00:49.566 --> 00:00:50.900
Painful things

26
00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:52.200
But don't worry.

27
00:00:52.766 --> 00:00:54.766
Oh yeah.

28
00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.966
No, I can't let him know about my condition.

29
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.366
Otherwise, I finally found a husband

30
00:01:01.366 --> 00:01:02.966
What if I'm scared to death again?
