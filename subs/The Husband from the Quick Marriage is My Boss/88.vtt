00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:03.800
I just want him to stay on the road

2
00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:06.066
Tortured him piece by piece

3
00:00:07.133 --> 00:00:08.533
Now the big picture is set

4
00:00:08.533 --> 00:00:10.933
10% of Fuji's shares are in your hands

5
00:00:10.933 --> 00:00:11.933
What are you afraid of?

6
00:00:11.933 --> 00:00:14.366
I'm just worried that this woman will pit you

7
00:00:14.366 --> 00:00:15.800
Didn't you say it all?

8
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.866
He and Fu Siye have divorced

9
00:00:17.866 --> 00:00:20.766
The man who went to the company gate to find him was another man

10
00:00:21.166 --> 00:00:24.400
If the child is in private business

11
00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.100
His little boyfriend

12
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:29.033
You can still come and deliver things without caring

13
00:00:29.966 --> 00:00:31.033
Yeah.

14
00:00:31.866 --> 00:00:33.500
Maybe I'm being too suspicious.

15
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.766
I know your dad's death hit you too hard

16
00:00:36.766 --> 00:00:38.533
How to put on makeup is your business

17
00:00:38.533 --> 00:00:39.866
Anyway, he is in the company

18
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:41.733
There are various ways to bully him

19
00:00:41.733 --> 00:00:42.900
I won't ask any more

20
00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.300
Our family has been alienated and made like this

21
00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:48.633
He had such a hard time

22
00:00:49.266 --> 00:00:51.066
And now she's pregnant.

23
00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:54.866
Tonight's fun

24
00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.200
Never let him live too comfortably

25
00:00:59.866 --> 00:01:00.666
come

26
00:01:01.366 --> 00:01:03.033
Let's congratulate the book manager

27
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.800
Congratulations to the book manager

28
00:01:07.733 --> 00:01:09.100
I'm going to take a call first

29
00:01:13.866 --> 00:01:14.800
Hello business

30
00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.300
Oh, I have a company dinner now

31
00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.066
I may be back later.

32
00:01:20.266 --> 00:01:22.100
Lu Automotive Repair doesn't know what abacus he has

33
00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.300
You have to be careful to send me the location in advance. Hmm.

34
00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:24.933
I see.

35
00:01:24.933 --> 00:01:26.533
If I don't reply to your message in half an hour

36
00:01:26.533 --> 00:01:28.200
Just give me a call

37
00:01:30.466 --> 00:01:33.066
You're sitting here alone so early

38
00:01:33.333 --> 00:01:36.400
This party has been specially prepared for you

39
00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.400
I'm not feeling well.

40
00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:39.866
Don't drink

41
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.100
Don't give me face

42
00:01:42.333 --> 00:01:44.300
I really can't drink

43
00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.700
Okay, I won't make it difficult for you.

44
00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:47.666
I'm going to have a cigarette
