00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:02.166
Lu Qixiu went to look for the tree again

2
00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:09.500
Mr. Lu might as well get straight to the point

3
00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:11.733
I can't believe we made such a bad scene yesterday

4
00:00:11.733 --> 00:00:13.633
Are you still willing to take a passenger with me?

5
00:00:13.666 --> 00:00:15.900
I am here today to discuss cooperation with Miss Shu

6
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.933
Yesterday you said you forgot some things.

7
00:00:17.933 --> 00:00:19.200
I'm actually curious

8
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.233
Fu Siye as President of Fuji

9
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.400
Why would you let your woman show up?

10
00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.533
It's so dangerous to talk about this cooperation

11
00:00:26.533 --> 00:00:30.066
Wait, you said Fu Siye is the president of Fuji

12
00:00:30.066 --> 00:00:31.200
Don't you know?

13
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.166
Go again

14
00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.200
I didn't expect him to hide so many things from you

15
00:00:38.866 --> 00:00:40.300
What else do you know?

16
00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:44.866
Since you forgot

17
00:00:44.866 --> 00:00:46.333
Then I'll help you remember

18
00:00:46.333 --> 00:00:48.700
The reason why you got sicker in the first place

19
00:00:48.733 --> 00:00:49.866
It's because you're drunk

20
00:00:49.866 --> 00:00:51.933
He was raped by Fu Siye in a hotel

21
00:00:51.933 --> 00:00:53.200
It was very exciting.

22
00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.900
So it's impossible

23
00:00:56.666 --> 00:00:57.733
I have proof

24
00:00:57.733 --> 00:00:59.833
You did have sex three years ago

25
00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:01.466
And I also found out

26
00:01:01.466 --> 00:01:03.600
You haven't had any contact for the past three years

27
00:01:03.966 --> 00:01:06.033
Then why did he suddenly get married to you?

28
00:01:06.333 --> 00:01:08.533
Isn't it because I recognized you at a glance?

29
00:01:08.533 --> 00:01:09.666
And feel guilty

30
00:01:11.266 --> 00:01:12.066
girl

31
00:01:12.766 --> 00:01:15.366
How can the girl be like this

32
00:01:17.166 --> 00:01:18.266
You spend every day with a man like this

33
00:01:18.266 --> 00:01:19.300
Get along day and night

34
00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:20.400
Don't you think it's scary?

35
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.533
He lied to you so much.

36
00:01:21.533 --> 00:01:22.466
Could it be that

37
00:01:23.533 --> 00:01:24.633
You don't want revenge

38
00:01:24.966 --> 00:01:26.266
If you want.

39
00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:27.333
I'm always welcome.

40
00:01:27.333 --> 00:01:29.100
I can give you a better platform to develop.

41
00:01:34.666 --> 00:01:36.066
Think about it.
