00:00:04.333 --> 00:00:05.533
I didn't expect it to be you.

2
00:00:05.533 --> 00:00:08.633
You lied to me before that you were the president of the vice city

3
00:00:08.966 --> 00:00:09.800
What happened?

4
00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:11.900
You're just a little assistant

5
00:00:11.933 --> 00:00:13.966
He won't know until he goes to the toilet

6
00:00:13.966 --> 00:00:15.400
Do you think you can still stay here?

7
00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:16.766
You don't have to scare him.

8
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:18.700
My mom knows about this

9
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.633
If Miss Shi is okay

10
00:00:20.966 --> 00:00:21.866
Go slowly

11
00:00:22.066 --> 00:00:23.733
Take your stuff away

12
00:00:23.733 --> 00:00:26.166
I don't, I don't eat it anymore, eat it

13
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:31.500
president

14
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.300
You asked me to investigate that for you. There's news

15
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.166
So what exactly is that bottle of medicine for?

16
00:00:35.166 --> 00:00:37.100
Is to treat mental illness

17
00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.833
So Miss Shu, I'll go home first, President

18
00:00:48.733 --> 00:00:50.700
No, it looks arrogant and domineering

19
00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:51.700
I started

20
00:00:54.866 --> 00:00:57.666
So it's really what we guessed?

21
00:00:57.666 --> 00:00:59.400
This is too coincidental

22
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:02.166
My mom is really your dad's ex-girlfriend

23
00:01:02.333 --> 00:01:05.433
And even more coincidentally, you forgot
