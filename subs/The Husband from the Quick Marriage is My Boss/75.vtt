00:00:01.466 --> 00:00:03.900
Tonight, Genting Restaurant Lu Qi will ask me to sign a contract

2
00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:05.500
Then you can ask the person you arranged to come over.

3
00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:06.966
Just swap the contract

4
00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.966
Miss

5
00:00:17.466 --> 00:00:18.300
Almost

6
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.066
I'm back at the company and I don't know what's going on

7
00:00:21.366 --> 00:00:24.966
This vice president has been treating me hot and cold lately

8
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.900
I can see that he's playing with me here

9
00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:31.900
But what about you as his little assistant

10
00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:34.600
It's okay to be ordered by me

11
00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:35.766
After all

12
00:00:35.766 --> 00:00:38.800
We already have that relationship between the two of us

13
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.300
Miss, shall we not talk about this?

14
00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:42.833
Don't say this

15
00:00:43.166 --> 00:00:46.900
Then it depends on your performance

16
00:00:54.666 --> 00:00:57.166
Look, I bought so many things today.

17
00:00:57.333 --> 00:00:58.966
I'm so happy.

18
00:00:59.266 --> 00:01:01.333
We'll buy whatever we like.

19
00:01:01.333 --> 00:01:03.100
Don't worry, I'll pay today.

20
00:01:03.766 --> 00:01:05.933
I'm a little embarrassed, oops.

21
00:01:05.933 --> 00:01:07.733
Aren't we sisters?

22
00:01:07.733 --> 00:01:10.300
Isn't it right to spend some money on sisters?

23
00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:11.500
Go, keep buying.

24
00:01:14.133 --> 00:01:14.933
nanny

25
00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.233
What a coincidence

26
00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.200
Why are you two shopping together?

27
00:01:30.466 --> 00:01:31.800
Young master is broken

28
00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:32.466
Miss Shi hit

29
00:01:32.466 --> 00:01:34.966
I saw my wife and Miss Shu's mother shopping together

30
00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:36.966
Will it affect our plan?

31
00:01:37.066 --> 00:01:38.233
Of course it does

32
00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.866
So you're following him until morning?
