00:00:01.566 --> 00:00:03.300
It was handed in in October

2
00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:10.800
The president didn't want to let him go so late

3
00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:20.200
Mr. Zhang, don't drink

4
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:23.833
You come to me

5
00:00:25.333 --> 00:00:28.233
Miss Shi, you can see clearly that I am not the president.

6
00:00:29.866 --> 00:00:32.433
How could I be wrong?

7
00:00:33.133 --> 00:00:34.166
You are the soil

8
00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.066
Miss Shi, let me take you back

9
00:00:37.733 --> 00:00:39.266
Uh no

10
00:00:40.166 --> 00:00:41.166
I'm on it.

11
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:42.633
Built a house

12
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.833
Come with me.

13
00:00:48.733 --> 00:00:49.566
Miss Shi

14
00:00:51.766 --> 00:00:52.566
OK

15
00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.700
Miss Shi, what are you doing?

16
00:00:57.266 --> 00:00:59.033
What do I do?

17
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.833
What do you think I'm going to do?

18
00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.000
Why didn't you bring him yesterday?

19
00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.366
I had a personal matter last night

20
00:01:41.566 --> 00:01:42.366
Say

21
00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:51.800
Sleep

22
00:01:52.766 --> 00:01:54.233
You have to forgive me.

23
00:01:55.066 --> 00:01:58.966
Last night, Miss Shi forced me not to make a wish.
