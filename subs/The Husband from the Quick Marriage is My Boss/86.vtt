1
00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:01.400
Money, right?

2
00:00:03.066 --> 00:00:03.966
That's enough!

3
00:00:04.866 --> 00:00:05.766
roll

4
00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:08.733
The book manager hasn't come yet.

5
00:00:08.733 --> 00:00:10.966
The cooperation talks must have failed.

6
00:00:10.966 --> 00:00:12.733
And he just got on the job.

7
00:00:12.733 --> 00:00:15.533
What ability can you have to eat the list of emotions?

8
00:00:15.533 --> 00:00:16.966
That is.

9
00:00:18.766 --> 00:00:20.366
Everyone be quiet

10
00:00:20.666 --> 00:00:23.066
Yesterday, I swore in the scriptures that

11
00:00:23.066 --> 00:00:24.500
Sure to eat

12
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.966
And the book is so beautiful

13
00:00:26.966 --> 00:00:29.433
There shouldn't be a list that can't be negotiated, right?

14
00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.433
Said the secretary was right

15
00:00:31.766 --> 00:00:33.800
I am beautiful and capable

16
00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.833
How can there be cooperation that I can't talk about?

17
00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:37.500
Mr. Gu, take a look

18
00:00:37.666 --> 00:00:38.500
In addition to that

19
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.466
Mr. Qin also added a secret to us

20
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:42.800
That's not possible.

21
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.866
It seems that this book is quite capable

22
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.566
Secretary Zhu is right

23
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.600
Unemployed

24
00:00:49.666 --> 00:00:51.166
Since I am in our company

25
00:00:51.166 --> 00:00:53.800
I will definitely work hard for the company wholeheartedly

26
00:00:53.966 --> 00:00:56.533
Even I believe in following in the footsteps of Mr. Lu

27
00:00:56.533 --> 00:00:59.133
In the near future we can surpass Fuji

28
00:00:59.133 --> 00:01:01.700
Successful leading industries

29
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.300
Miss Shu just took office

30
00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.500
You got such a big order for us.

31
00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.066
Tonight we are preparing a welcome banquet for Miss Shu

32
00:01:12.866 --> 00:01:13.666
How did it go?
