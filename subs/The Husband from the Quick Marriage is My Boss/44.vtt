00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.500
Do you like me?

2
00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:02.866
Why are you taking the treatment?

3
00:00:02.866 --> 00:00:04.466
What about mental illness drugs?

4
00:00:04.466 --> 00:00:06.733
Did we have a relationship in the first place?

5
00:00:06.733 --> 00:00:08.133
For this reason

6
00:00:08.133 --> 00:00:09.600
So you forgot

7
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.266
You haven't slept yet?

8
00:00:14.733 --> 00:00:16.233
Think about what to say

9
00:00:18.066 --> 00:00:20.766
It's not about you getting me the invitation

10
00:00:20.766 --> 00:00:22.900
I haven't had time to thank you yet.

11
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.400
Are you going to trouble the vice president?

12
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.066
I feel weird sorry

13
00:00:28.366 --> 00:00:32.833
It's okay, do you want to think about how to thank me?

14
00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:36.300
Well, I'll treat you to dinner.

15
00:00:37.333 --> 00:00:39.300
So what sensibility do you want?

16
00:00:39.933 --> 00:00:42.833
I do have a better way to thank you

17
00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:45.100
Ah!

18
00:00:47.066 --> 00:00:48.233
Last time.

19
00:00:48.766 --> 00:00:50.233
Unfinished business

20
00:00:50.466 --> 00:00:52.066
Do you want to make up for me?

21
00:00:52.466 --> 00:00:54.500
Don't believe me

22
00:00:57.366 --> 00:00:58.866
Is there something you're not telling me?

23
00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:00.233
Uh, no.

24
00:01:00.333 --> 00:01:01.533
Oops I promise you

25
00:01:01.533 --> 00:01:03.466
Wait until I stay in the company on my own

26
00:01:03.466 --> 00:01:06.066
I will fulfill your invitation, okay?

27
00:01:09.366 --> 00:01:10.200
Sleep with your wife

28
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.266
How do you make me look like a beast?
