00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:02.200
Yan'er, look at this person in your bag.

2
00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:05.000
He's just a lunatic, and his mouth is still hard

3
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Sister, is there anything wrong with Lei Shao?

4
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.966
Lei Jia is about to integrate into the Kunlun system

5
00:00:08.966 --> 00:00:11.466
This boss doesn't even deserve to carry Lei Shao's shoes

6
00:00:11.466 --> 00:00:13.733
Grandpa, don't you hurry up and apologize to your ancestors?

7
00:00:13.733 --> 00:00:15.500
Say you're just a substitute

8
00:00:17.666 --> 00:00:18.600
Have you decided?

9
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.000
Make this engagement with my apprentice and you can't break it

10
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.400
This marriage is witnessed by heaven and earth

11
00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.800
Provided that at least my grandson is a trifle

12
00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:30.666
How is that possible?

13
00:00:30.666 --> 00:00:31.900
This old ancestor

14
00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:33.966
How is it the same as the forestry master?

15
00:00:33.966 --> 00:00:35.966
The forestry master is the ancestor

16
00:00:35.966 --> 00:00:40.133
Is that forestry the new father?

17
00:00:40.133 --> 00:00:41.100
Is this Yuan'er?

18
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.300
Look at how angry you are with your grandfather

19
00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:44.866
You speak for people

20
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.300
Forestry, aren't you very good at playing?

21
00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.700
Hit it and see if your fists are hard

22
00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:53.733
Or the toughness of Kunlun's guards

23
00:00:53.733 --> 00:00:56.866
You didn't seize Master Lin's last chance

24
00:00:56.866 --> 00:00:59.533
You think it's worth a rat gun for who you are

25
00:00:59.533 --> 00:01:01.700
You are vain and arrogant

26
00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:03.700
Let you go to the abyss step by step

27
00:01:03.733 --> 00:01:05.500
Oops, you're risking your own death.

28
00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:06.966
Don't stop our family

29
00:01:06.966 --> 00:01:07.866
What are you doing standing there?

30
00:01:07.866 --> 00:01:10.066
Let me go and don't get arrested

31
00:01:10.066 --> 00:01:12.000
The old idea is to let them do it

32
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Dead people are full of smoke

33
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.966
This is the only way.

34
00:01:14.966 --> 00:01:16.766
Otherwise, the spirit will die
