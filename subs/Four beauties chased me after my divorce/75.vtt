00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.000
Forestry, do you still want to mess around on this occasion?

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.166
Not good for such a big occasion

3
00:00:04.166 --> 00:00:05.766
As long as forestry is not too excessive

4
00:00:05.766 --> 00:00:06.966
At most, you will be expelled.

5
00:00:06.966 --> 00:00:08.166
No one did anything to him

6
00:00:08.166 --> 00:00:10.500
Go back and tell him to get out of Hero Forestry quickly

7
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.000
What exactly do you want to do?

8
00:00:12.066 --> 00:00:12.700
I'll tell you what.

9
00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:14.400
I want to have unrealistic ideas

10
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:15.400
Even if this child

11
00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.566
You can't give birth to a labor prisoner

12
00:00:17.566 --> 00:00:19.100
It's a shame for the family

13
00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:19.966
You shameless

14
00:00:19.966 --> 00:00:22.166
Your dad and I still have this face

15
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:23.933
Eat it, why don't you eat it?

16
00:00:23.933 --> 00:00:24.766
Don't eat

17
00:00:24.766 --> 00:00:26.900
I only eat when I'm happy

18
00:00:26.933 --> 00:00:28.566
I'm really not happy to see me

19
00:00:28.566 --> 00:00:30.166
For the sake of you and me

20
00:00:30.166 --> 00:00:31.466
I will not pursue the past with you

21
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.000
You can keep running your company

22
00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:34.666
As for the $1 billion contract

23
00:00:34.766 --> 00:00:37.100
I can also take time off to continue investing in you.

24
00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.133
When are you still daydreaming?

25
00:00:39.133 --> 00:00:41.600
Wake up, today is Kunlun's pre-election banquet

26
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.000
Not where you spill

27
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.400
Dad, you take yourself too seriously

28
00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.266
You cured the word thing

29
00:00:47.266 --> 00:00:49.066
We have already paid for the consultation.

30
00:00:49.066 --> 00:00:51.966
You have nothing to do with us winners anymore

31
00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.166
Dad, what are you?

32
00:00:54.166 --> 00:00:56.166
You can also wake me up in front of my grandmother

33
00:00:56.166 --> 00:00:57.000
Tell you yesterday

34
00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.700
Lord Takeshi asked Zhao Yu to invite Miss Hu

35
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:00.600
Have a make-up meal together

36
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.900
It acknowledges the success of his grandmother

37
00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.266
Bright moon, congratulations to you and me now

38
00:01:05.266 --> 00:01:07.733
It's no longer something you can place on the Qin family's thighs

39
00:01:07.733 --> 00:01:08.533
Yes.
