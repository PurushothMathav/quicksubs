00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:03.000
30 years ago, Lei Hong faked a car accident

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.766
Killed his own partner

3
00:00:04.766 --> 00:00:07.500
He also pretended to be his family to deceive the owner of compensation

4
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:08.733
Close its qualifications

5
00:00:08.733 --> 00:00:11.833
Earned a profit of 50 million and received the first initial funding

6
00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:12.933
Nonsense

7
00:00:12.933 --> 00:00:13.966
Second Emperor Xinkou

8
00:00:13.966 --> 00:00:15.400
Build something out of nothing

9
00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:18.400
Why don't you hurry up and get out of here 25 years ago

10
00:00:24.466 --> 00:00:27.966
Until the left foot kills people, it is even worse than Satan

11
00:00:27.966 --> 00:00:28.866
Several times to kill horses

12
00:00:28.966 --> 00:00:30.700
Count, there are dozens of acres at the smallest

13
00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:32.933
Give me how much of yourself you think is enough to die

14
00:00:32.933 --> 00:00:34.066
Why does he do everything?

15
00:00:34.066 --> 00:00:35.400
Something without evidence

16
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.066
You say I did it, I did it

17
00:00:37.066 --> 00:00:38.300
You slander me so much

18
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.866
Did you know that you can go to jail for spreading rumors?

19
00:00:40.866 --> 00:00:43.166
Lee, you are capturing attention in prison

20
00:00:43.166 --> 00:00:44.800
It sounds like he dares to speak out

21
00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.233
How brave

22
00:00:46.866 --> 00:00:47.966
What happened to you in prison

23
00:00:47.966 --> 00:00:49.066
How can you say it?

24
00:00:49.066 --> 00:00:50.600
Tell me you're wrong.

25
00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.933
Qin Yan, you are tied up by me and talking

26
00:00:52.933 --> 00:00:54.533
Dad, what are you thinking?

27
00:00:54.533 --> 00:00:55.066
You are not a weakness

28
00:00:55.066 --> 00:00:58.400
This silly girl, I still think she's hiding on the tiger

29
00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.600
I seem to have seen it somewhere

30
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:01.700
Mr. Qin

31
00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:03.966
You want to talk nonsense like forestry

32
00:01:03.966 --> 00:01:05.366
Is it a random climbing relationship?

33
00:01:05.366 --> 00:01:07.866
My lord, this forest is not just a rumor

34
00:01:07.866 --> 00:01:09.533
He still dares to pretend to be the new master

35
00:01:09.533 --> 00:01:11.300
He said today without him

36
00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:13.400
This captain can't handle it if he's older
