00:00:01.166 --> 00:00:02.766
What did you do?

2
00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:03.866
What kind of magic?

3
00:00:03.866 --> 00:00:05.266
What kind of magic

4
00:00:05.366 --> 00:00:06.933
It's just that you're afraid of me

5
00:00:06.933 --> 00:00:09.233
Joke I will be afraid of you

6
00:00:09.266 --> 00:00:10.466
I think you are crazy

7
00:00:10.466 --> 00:00:11.966
What do you have to fear?

8
00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:14.000
Because you can't do well?

9
00:00:14.133 --> 00:00:17.366
If you're not afraid, why should I be angry?

10
00:00:17.366 --> 00:00:19.566
Cheap, what do you mean?

11
00:00:19.733 --> 00:00:21.166
Just say you are Qin Yan

12
00:00:21.533 --> 00:00:24.366
The people of my Qin family are not insulted by you.

13
00:00:24.366 --> 00:00:25.766
I did not insult any

14
00:00:25.766 --> 00:00:27.866
What he just lost is not a return book.

15
00:00:27.866 --> 00:00:29.200
It was lost.

16
00:00:29.333 --> 00:00:30.666
I told him to pick it up.

17
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.400
Just giving him a chance

18
00:00:32.733 --> 00:00:34.766
You give my dad a good talk

19
00:00:35.466 --> 00:00:37.500
Dad Forestry has no misunderstanding

20
00:00:37.566 --> 00:00:39.100
But treat yourself and throw yourself away

21
00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.366
The man who doesn't beat grandpa let him pick it up

22
00:00:41.366 --> 00:00:42.400
I am the closest

23
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:46.666
Why are you determined to marry forestry?

24
00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:51.800
Sister, have you thought it through?

25
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.433
You are thundering less's face

26
00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.633
I got married and co-organized with the Lei family

27
00:00:55.666 --> 00:00:57.700
Our two are just not in a cooperative relationship

28
00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:59.066
The marriage of the Japanese fish and the Lei family

29
00:00:59.566 --> 00:01:00.700
Definitely not you.

30
00:01:00.766 --> 00:01:02.966
Today, Lei Jia also returned to Li Dajiang City

31
00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.766
Even if you disagree

32
00:01:04.766 --> 00:01:07.033
Don't tell me these words

33
00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.300
Everyone is welcoming the Lord of Kunlun

34
00:01:09.333 --> 00:01:12.600
Do you still want to be in front of the Lord of Kunlun?

35
00:01:12.733 --> 00:01:14.233
Stop any jokes?

36
00:01:14.866 --> 00:01:17.766
I'd like to see who is so brave

37
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.400
The corner is up on my head
