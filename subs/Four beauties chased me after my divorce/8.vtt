00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:02.700
Today is your home court

2
00:00:02.733 --> 00:00:04.000
This investment banquet

3
00:00:04.166 --> 00:00:05.700
4 big gambles have pulled you

4
00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.200
This is an unprecedented holy light in Jiangcheng

5
00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:10.166
I still have to thank Mr. Han for his recommendation

6
00:00:10.166 --> 00:00:11.300
I toast you

7
00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:16.266
These two are on the left, this is Chen Jiajia

8
00:00:16.266 --> 00:00:18.033
On the right is Chang Jiajia.

9
00:00:18.066 --> 00:00:20.133
It was the two of them

10
00:00:20.133 --> 00:00:22.533
Assets add up to over 100 billion, right?

11
00:00:22.533 --> 00:00:23.600
Just a lot more

12
00:00:24.566 --> 00:00:25.366
Han Shao

13
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.300
This is today's heroine, Miss Hu

14
00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:30.200
This Miss Hu looks really temperamental

15
00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:31.500
Long Yang two seniors

16
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.000
I was so generous when I saw you today

17
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:34.933
Thank you very much.

18
00:00:34.933 --> 00:00:37.166
Miss Hu can be wooed by the four major courtiers

19
00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:39.966
Future ex-husbands are not something we can compare to

20
00:00:39.966 --> 00:00:41.800
The two seniors are humble

21
00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.900
inside

22
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.733
Miss Wu, this is your friend.

23
00:00:50.733 --> 00:00:52.366
He is Miss Hu's ex-husband

24
00:00:52.366 --> 00:00:53.866
He learned that Miss Hu

25
00:00:53.866 --> 00:00:55.900
Received the appreciation and investment of the Qin family

26
00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:57.700
I guess it's for money.

27
00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:59.433
He's so brave

28
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.966
Dare to break into the joint investment banquet of 4 wealthy families

29
00:01:01.966 --> 00:01:03.333
What's going on in this hotel?

30
00:01:03.333 --> 00:01:04.766
Leave everyone alone

31
00:01:04.766 --> 00:01:06.600
Aren't you afraid of the anger of the four wealthy families?

32
00:01:06.866 --> 00:01:07.666
OK

33
00:01:07.733 --> 00:01:09.100
It should be for me

34
00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:10.866
I'm going to drive him away

35
00:01:15.466 --> 00:01:17.866
Mingyue, is this where you want to enter?

36
00:01:17.866 --> 00:01:19.733
Baizi is still investing in the signing banquet

37
00:01:19.733 --> 00:01:21.533
All of them are not the Jiangnan Application Rights Association

38
00:01:21.533 --> 00:01:23.033
Industry experience

39
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.800
This is not where you mess up.
