00:00:07.533 --> 00:00:08.500
Miss Qin

2
00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:13.166
You are not as humble as outsiders have heard.

3
00:00:14.166 --> 00:00:15.233
Arish

4
00:00:15.666 --> 00:00:18.200
You are the heir to the first family in Magic City

5
00:00:18.333 --> 00:00:20.400
How could you do such a thing?

6
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:22.633
Something.

7
00:00:22.933 --> 00:00:24.633
Don't need to do it yourself

8
00:00:24.766 --> 00:00:26.233
Someone will do it for you.

9
00:00:26.766 --> 00:00:27.900
Like what?

10
00:00:28.666 --> 00:00:30.100
Your family.

11
00:00:32.566 --> 00:00:33.800
That's not possible.

12
00:00:35.766 --> 00:00:36.900
How is it impossible

13
00:00:39.133 --> 00:00:39.966
I'll tell you what.

14
00:00:39.966 --> 00:00:41.233
Stay away from me

15
00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.500
Or I'll put you in jail tomorrow

16
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:44.500
If I don't

17
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.400
You know, I've been out of your sight now.

18
00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:53.300
Nope.

19
00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:58.200
Ah!

20
00:01:00.266 --> 00:01:02.366
I will be him today

21
00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.266
Let me take a look for a while, you will laugh.

22
00:01:05.366 --> 00:01:08.366
Mother tea is not sick in my room

23
00:01:10.066 --> 00:01:11.766
I was already forced

24
00:01:12.066 --> 00:01:13.566
I didn't give the medicine either

25
00:01:13.566 --> 00:01:15.500
I didn't arrange the meal either

26
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.266
I already told you

27
00:01:18.266 --> 00:01:20.100
Between you and me

28
00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:21.666
It's not about two people

29
00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.700
So what if you don't like me?

30
00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:25.333
Even if I marry you

31
00:01:25.333 --> 00:01:27.000
I don't mean it either.

32
00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:28.700
Does it make sense?

33
00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:29.866
So what?

34
00:01:32.066 --> 00:01:33.133
Call

35
00:01:33.133 --> 00:01:34.000
hit

36
00:01:35.166 --> 00:01:37.600
I'll see who can answer your call

37
00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.700
Why doesn't your family answer your phone?
