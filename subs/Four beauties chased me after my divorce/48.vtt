00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.400
Do you want Lin Ye to participate?

2
00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:03.500
Why not?

3
00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:05.866
Didn't you say that you can participate if you have the ability?

4
00:00:05.966 --> 00:00:08.466
Lin Yi can treat vegetative people

5
00:00:08.466 --> 00:00:10.300
You still want to continue the engagement

6
00:00:10.366 --> 00:00:12.966
Grandpa has just announced in public that the marriage is invalid

7
00:00:13.866 --> 00:00:15.466
Who to marry is not marriage

8
00:00:15.466 --> 00:00:16.466
I'll tell you what.

9
00:00:16.466 --> 00:00:18.933
If you still want me to marry Lei Zhi and marry you

10
00:00:18.933 --> 00:00:19.966
Dead heart

11
00:00:20.666 --> 00:00:23.166
And maybe with Lin Yan's ability

12
00:00:23.166 --> 00:00:24.833
Can really admit the cloud-piercing arrow

13
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.800
But he pretended to be the Lord of Kunlun

14
00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.300
It's dead now

15
00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:29.700
Bragging at best

16
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:31.000
Not to mention impersonation

17
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.800
And Lei Zhi is on the line

18
00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.366
Isn't it just to get revenge on Lin Yan?

19
00:00:34.866 --> 00:00:37.366
Since the meritocracy banquet held by Kunlun Yimai

20
00:00:37.566 --> 00:00:38.600
Then I believe

21
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.800
Naturally not incompetent because of this trivial matter

22
00:00:41.066 --> 00:00:43.233
But okay, it's settled.

23
00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.633
Three days later, it will bring you blood overnight

24
00:00:45.966 --> 00:00:47.300
You can't go home and say

25
00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:48.166
It's public.

26
00:00:48.166 --> 00:00:50.566
Even if I don't say it, he will be found out

27
00:00:50.666 --> 00:00:53.600
Let him forget what happened

28
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.933
I asked for leave in a thousand words.

29
00:00:55.933 --> 00:00:57.433
Know I said this

30
00:00:57.466 --> 00:00:59.700
Then you can give me some honest training

31
00:01:00.166 --> 00:01:02.300
If you dare not speak, no one will

32
00:01:04.133 --> 00:01:05.033
Not beaten up

33
00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.466
Diligent and thrifty

34
00:01:12.733 --> 00:01:14.866
Forestry counts, I beg you?

35
00:01:14.866 --> 00:01:16.800
For the sake of our fiancÃ©es

36
00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.666
Promise me this will end today

37
00:01:19.766 --> 00:01:21.300
Don't provoke Li Qiang again

38
00:01:21.466 --> 00:01:24.400
Yeah, and then go sign up for a college

39
00:01:24.466 --> 00:01:25.566
The family cannot understand

40
00:01:25.566 --> 00:01:27.666
Then you will have some status

41
00:01:27.766 --> 00:01:29.900
People don't dare to touch you blatantly

42
00:01:29.933 --> 00:01:31.633
If he doesn't touch me, I will touch him too

43
00:01:31.866 --> 00:01:33.266
What is this Lei's hat doing?

44
00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.233
You have to bring it.

45
00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.833
Owe him first, okay?

46
00:01:37.933 --> 00:01:40.100
Look at our face in three minutes

47
00:01:40.133 --> 00:01:42.200
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

48
00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.833
Just for the sake of you guys

49
00:01:44.333 --> 00:01:45.533
Pause and let him go once

50
00:01:45.533 --> 00:01:47.666
Then you go to the store room to rest today.

51
00:01:47.733 --> 00:01:49.800
I'll take you to a study party in three days

52
00:01:49.933 --> 00:01:50.933
We just woke up

53
00:01:50.933 --> 00:01:52.300
There's still a lot to do

54
00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:53.500
Take care of yourself

55
00:01:53.566 --> 00:01:55.766
It just so happens that I have something to go home to deal with
