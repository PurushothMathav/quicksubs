00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:03.300
I said anyone can be said to be a labor prisoner

2
00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:05.566
I don't have this qualification

3
00:00:05.866 --> 00:00:08.933
You don't even know your so-called Chev

4
00:00:08.933 --> 00:00:09.700
He can be cured

5
00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:10.933
The world can't cure it

6
00:00:10.933 --> 00:00:13.500
The vegetative person is Miss Qin

7
00:00:13.533 --> 00:00:15.266
You yourself said that vegetative people cannot be cured

8
00:00:15.266 --> 00:00:16.866
Why can he spirit?

9
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.733
You are afraid that he will be deceived.

10
00:00:18.733 --> 00:00:20.033
Yes, Miss Qin

11
00:00:20.566 --> 00:00:21.800
He is an old milk

12
00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.133
I've never heard of any medical skills before.

13
00:00:24.133 --> 00:00:26.400
Yes, Miss, this must have been a misunderstanding at the beginning

14
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.533
Vegetables can't be cured at all

15
00:00:27.533 --> 00:00:28.166
Cancer is possible

16
00:00:28.166 --> 00:00:29.600
It's impossible to be in a vegetative state

17
00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:32.533
So you're saying I shouldn't wake up?

18
00:00:32.533 --> 00:00:34.533
Hey, sister, don't be deceived.

19
00:00:34.533 --> 00:00:35.666
The national doctor has said that

20
00:00:35.666 --> 00:00:37.166
There is little hope that you will wake up

21
00:00:37.166 --> 00:00:38.666
Even he has no way

22
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.233
Mingyue, why don't you kneel down soon?

23
00:00:41.266 --> 00:00:44.033
Tell Miss Qin how you deceived her

24
00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:45.900
You blame it

25
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:46.800
I can't eat

26
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.166
My dog is enough

27
00:00:48.166 --> 00:00:49.466
Didn't Lin Yan save me?

28
00:00:49.466 --> 00:00:50.400
Is that you?

29
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.533
Mr. Lin's medical skills are indeed good

30
00:00:53.533 --> 00:00:55.633
But your marriage to Qin Yan

31
00:00:55.766 --> 00:00:57.166
I don't agree with that.
