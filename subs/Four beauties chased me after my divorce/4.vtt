00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.333
Mom, I'm out of jail together

2
00:00:02.333 --> 00:00:03.600
I wanted to surprise you

3
00:00:03.866 --> 00:00:05.166
But I didn't tell you

4
00:00:05.266 --> 00:00:06.733
Since you are back

5
00:00:06.733 --> 00:00:09.866
Just in time to take away the trust and your divorce certificate

6
00:00:10.533 --> 00:00:12.000
Mom, what's going on?

7
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.333
I didn't divorce Xiner

8
00:00:13.333 --> 00:00:14.866
You go to jail for three years

9
00:00:14.866 --> 00:00:17.766
We can go directly to your Civil Affairs Bureau to file for divorce.

10
00:00:17.766 --> 00:00:19.266
I don't need your consent.

11
00:00:19.266 --> 00:00:20.866
I have such a good relationship with Xiner

12
00:00:20.866 --> 00:00:22.100
How can you call the shots?

13
00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:23.100
Divorced us both

14
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.966
We are not from the same world

15
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.433
Divorce happens to be my own way

16
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.766
Why do you have to give me an explanation?

17
00:00:30.766 --> 00:00:31.600
Don't worry.

18
00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:34.066
I will not lose a penny of the compensation I should give you.

19
00:00:34.366 --> 00:00:36.000
I can even give you some extra.

20
00:00:37.266 --> 00:00:38.466
No compensation is required.

21
00:00:38.466 --> 00:00:40.700
I just want to know why you want to divorce me

22
00:00:40.766 --> 00:00:43.700
One, you don't pee. Take a picture of yourself

23
00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:45.966
You were not worthy of my Xiner before

24
00:00:46.133 --> 00:00:47.666
It's the same now.

25
00:00:47.666 --> 00:00:50.333
Mom, when I used to make money for my family

26
00:00:50.333 --> 00:00:52.100
That's not how you treat me.

27
00:00:52.133 --> 00:00:53.100
Don't Call Me Mom

28
00:00:53.266 --> 00:00:55.233
I don't have this republican philosophy

29
00:00:55.533 --> 00:00:58.266
Lin Bin, stop messing around

30
00:00:58.266 --> 00:01:00.066
It's not the same now

31
00:01:00.066 --> 00:01:02.833
Now I can't have a prison husband

32
00:01:03.366 --> 00:01:05.466
That's why you want to divorce me?

33
00:01:05.466 --> 00:01:06.533
I'll tell you the truth.

34
00:01:06.533 --> 00:01:08.466
The company is about to take advantage of you

35
00:01:08.733 --> 00:01:10.466
I'm about to do a big project.

36
00:01:10.466 --> 00:01:11.266
If it is done

37
00:01:11.266 --> 00:01:13.500
There will be a foothold in the whole of Jiangnan

38
00:01:13.566 --> 00:01:15.700
I can't have a king outside, monitor

39
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.333
So you think I'm dragging you down

40
00:01:23.333 --> 00:01:25.266
You're self-aware.

41
00:01:25.266 --> 00:01:26.200
I'll tell you what.

42
00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.900
Don't use this to deceive us loudly

43
00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:30.900
We're not to be messed with

44
00:01:30.966 --> 00:01:32.366
The donor is Junjie

45
00:01:32.366 --> 00:01:34.100
Since my sister has already said so

46
00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.900
As a man, you should accept it calmly.

47
00:01:36.933 --> 00:01:38.000
My sister now

48
00:01:38.333 --> 00:01:40.566
Received the reward of the four great heroes

49
00:01:40.566 --> 00:01:43.833
Not everyone can afford it

50
00:01:44.066 --> 00:01:45.933
Shin Shin, you want to succeed.

51
00:01:45.933 --> 00:01:47.466
You want money?

52
00:01:47.466 --> 00:01:48.966
You want power?

53
00:01:48.966 --> 00:01:51.433
Why do you think I can't give it to you?

54
00:01:51.533 --> 00:01:52.333
Shin Shin

55
00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.300
Just because of this question, I want to talk to

56
00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:57.433
I'm divorced, don't you think you're too strong?

57
00:01:59.566 --> 00:02:00.600
bright moon

58
00:02:01.733 --> 00:02:04.333
You used to be a real person

59
00:02:04.333 --> 00:02:07.300
Why did you become so vain after three years in?

60
00:02:07.333 --> 00:02:09.666
I ask you what can you give me for three years?

61
00:02:09.766 --> 00:02:11.466
Bragging without drafting

62
00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.866
I'm not being vain here

63
00:02:14.866 --> 00:02:16.700
I want to work hard step by step on my own

64
00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.800
You don't understand the feeling of going to the top

65
00:02:21.566 --> 00:02:22.366
Do you know

66
00:02:22.366 --> 00:02:25.033
The support of your so-called four families

67
00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.633
I asked them to arrange it.
