00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.500
I came back today for one thing

2
00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:03.980
divorce

3
00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:05.720
No way.

4
00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:09.920
How can you say such a thing as quitting the marriage?

5
00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:12.540
How to understand human speech

6
00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:13.920
i

7
00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.180
Revival, who gave you the qualifications to get you out of marriage?

8
00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:19.500
Yeah bro

9
00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:21.660
Miss Song is talented

10
00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.780
How can you make him sad in front of everyone? It's not your turn to interrupt here.

11
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.200
I don't want you to give me an explanation today

12
00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.920
Then there's no need for our two families to date

13
00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.020
Lao Song, don't be angry

14
00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:38.780
Maybe this little grandson is in a hurry

15
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:40.460
Saying the wrong thing

16
00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.780
You are not too young

17
00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.540
It's also the age to get married

18
00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.180
Look at the whole man

19
00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:49.060
Qingqing is the most suitable for you

20
00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.300
You must marry me

21
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:53.780
If I don't

22
00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:56.420
I won't tell you the letter payment.

23
00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:59.820
From the day you abandoned your wife

24
00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.980
I should find a way to challenge you

25
00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:05.660
Your rebel

26
00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.380
How dare you talk to me like this

27
00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:10.140
Dad is pissed me off

28
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.780
Don't forget that you also have a precious son?

29
00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:16.620
Although born humble

30
00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:18.100
But no matter how bad

31
00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:20.100
He is also a rich young master

32
00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:23.020
It's a good match for Miss Song

33
00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:25.860
I have other things to do

34
00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:27.840
Don't call me next time

35
00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:28.860
I've been busy.

36
00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:30.320
revival

37
00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:35.220
No way.

38
00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.020
We grew up together

39
00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.300
Emotions are the deepest

40
00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:41.900
How are you

41
00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.060
How can you break off the marriage?
