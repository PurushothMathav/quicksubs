00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:03.980
What if Sunan has the ability?

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.720
As long as I don't pass

3
00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:07.620
His solution was a pile of waste paper

4
00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:10.540
When he goes bankrupt, I'll see how he's too revived

5
00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.600
Mr. Su, I am very dissatisfied with your plan this time.

6
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.060
I suggest you save it

7
00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.740
No, why are you here?

8
00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.780
Song Qingqing, you deliberately embarrassed Sunan to threaten me

9
00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:34.720
OK

10
00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:36.660
Not revival

11
00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:38.260
That's not what I meant.

12
00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.220
I just want to

13
00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:44.140
If even the plan written by the president himself fails the re-examination

14
00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:47.300
Then you don't deserve to cooperate with us after the re-examination.

15
00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:51.220
Because you Song enterprise don't even have anyone who knows the goods.

16
00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:53.820
The plan was written by you

17
00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.140
I just wanted to embarrass him

18
00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:01.980
I didn't mean to embarrass you

19
00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.280
Sunan will be back soon

20
00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.380
I won't be disappointed this time.

21
00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:08.340
Will not

22
00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:19.820
Miss Song's plan has been changed

23
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.660
Why is the plan here?

24
00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.940
I am very satisfied with Mr. Su's plan this time

25
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.740
If there is no problem

26
00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:29.820
Just sign

27
00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:31.700
Passed

28
00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.560
Ok ok miss song

29
00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.300
If you have any questions in the future, you can contact me at any time.

30
00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:43.840
Mr. Su

31
00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:47.400
The plan was written by your assistant

32
00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.180
I am satisfied with his ability.

33
00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:52.420
It just so happens that our Song enterprise needs such talents

34
00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:54.740
If I take him away

35
00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.020
You shouldn't mind, right?
