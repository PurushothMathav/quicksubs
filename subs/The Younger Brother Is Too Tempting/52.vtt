00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:05.660
Miss Song, these plans are all made according to your requirements.

2
00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:06.860
Can you say

3
00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:12.380
You are questioning me

4
00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:16.100
Mr. Su, I am a fake party

5
00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.060
Have the right not to plan

6
00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:21.380
If you can't give me a satisfactory answer

7
00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.660
Just wait for the lawyer's letter

8
00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.920
Dare to send me a kiss, strong person

9
00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.380
This is what happens.

10
00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:42.540
unclear

11
00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.280
Why are you here?

12
00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.320
Fuxin, you came just in time.

13
00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.140
Hurry up and appease Mr. Su

14
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.740
He's on fire right now

15
00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:53.300
What happened to Mr. Su?

16
00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.800
The person in charge of the Song enterprise doesn't know which tendon is wrong.

17
00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.700
The difficulty of picking on Mr. Su

18
00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:00.640
We stayed up for a few big nights

19
00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.960
It has been changed for the fifth time this week alone.

20
00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.940
If you don't pass it, you will have to eat a lawyer's letter.

21
00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.500
What about 50 million liquidated damages?

22
00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.020
That's a lot of money.

23
00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:15.320
Song Shi, you go to work first

24
00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:16.500
Leave it to me.

25
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.660
Sister, put the documents on the table and go out. I'm busy.

26
00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.760
Sister, you have been busy all day.

27
00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:43.380
Why don't you take a break?

28
00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:45.600
This week is the last day left

29
00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.540
This plan must be made

30
00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:51.280
Sister, if you can trust me

31
00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:52.640
Leave the plan to me

32
00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.160
I have been in Fuji before

33
00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:55.660
I worked on a lot of projects.

34
00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.500
Quality? Nothing to say.
