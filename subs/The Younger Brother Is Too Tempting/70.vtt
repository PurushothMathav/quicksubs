00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.780
Mr. Yang, our company is looking forward to cooperating with you.

2
00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:03.900
Here's the plan.

3
00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:05.060
Please take a look.

4
00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:11.160
Sunan come out for me

5
00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:11.720
Take it out

6
00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:12.660
Give me out

7
00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:15.520
Come out, I am the mother of your motherland.

8
00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:16.980
I have something to do with him

9
00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.200
Sunan, please wait a moment.

10
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.300
Mr. Su is busy

11
00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:22.120
The house is dirtier than his dog's clothes

12
00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:23.840
He's still in the mood to talk about work

13
00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:27.600
Let Mrs. Sunan come out. Madam, please wait a moment.

14
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.820
Madam Sunan, come out for me

15
00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:32.020
Get out of the way sunan

16
00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:34.460
Mr. Su really didn't stop him

17
00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:36.620
You go out first

18
00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:41.240
Mom, I'm talking about work.

19
00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:42.580
Why don't you go out first

20
00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.360
You have to let that little white face come out and apologize one by one today

21
00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.700
Otherwise I won't be leaving today

22
00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:51.040
Mom

23
00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:54.960
Mr. Yang, I have some personal matters to deal with

24
00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.740
Would you like to sit for a while?

25
00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.480
Mom, this was Zoe's fault

26
00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.220
Why should I apologize to him?

27
00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:06.600
Hey, what you said

28
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.140
How can a girl destroy her own life?

29
00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.880
I think you're just fascinated by him

30
00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.580
I don't even help my own family

31
00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:16.800
Okay, I'll explain it to you later.

32
00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.040
You go out first

33
00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:21.040
No, you let that kid come over now

34
00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:22.420
Otherwise I won't go

35
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.000
Mr. Su, you'd better solve your personal problems first.

36
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.740
As for cooperation

37
00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.540
Let's talk about it another day
