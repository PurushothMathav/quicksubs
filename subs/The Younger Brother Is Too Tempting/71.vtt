00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.280
Ah, good.

2
00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:03.880
Mr. Yang, thank you very much for your trust in us.

3
00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:05.600
I will definitely be responsible to the end.

4
00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:09.280
Since there is no problem, I will go back first.

5
00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:11.620
I will ask the assistant to contact you later.

6
00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:13.020
Ok, take your time.

7
00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:16.860
Ah, Mr. Yang, please

8
00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:34.500
Shouldn't you be re-examining?

9
00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.320
Why are you here?

10
00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.140
What to ask and what not to ask

11
00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:39.500
Don't you understand?

12
00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:42.620
It depends on your face that today's cooperation can be achieved.

13
00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.340
Don't worry, I know what to do next.

14
00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:47.200
Hey

15
00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.280
President Su, President Yang

16
00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.360
You left our plan in my office.

17
00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:55.080
You see, I patronize and talk to Xiaofu

18
00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:56.500
I forgot everything.

19
00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.060
Mr. Su, then I'll go first

20
00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:00.900
Mr. Liu, this way please

21
00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:19.860
That's right, I'm the special author Fuxin by the vice president's side

22
00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:21.900
But that was before

23
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.180
Xiaofu was a special work of the vice president before

24
00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:26.820
Fuxin

25
00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.980
What identity is it?

26
00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.180
Zhou Ke

27
00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.700
Mr. Su, are you looking for me?

28
00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:38.920
Check the background information on the revival

29
00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:40.100
The sooner the better.
