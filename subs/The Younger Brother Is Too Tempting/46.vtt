00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:03.520
Sunan, how dare you run away from marriage in public?

2
00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:05.360
You are really capable

3
00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:06.640
Before the marriage is over

4
00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:07.920
You hurry back with mom

5
00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:09.780
Don't hurt Fujian's face

6
00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.500
Mom, I will not marry Fu Chen

7
00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:16.560
Nan Nan

8
00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.340
What can you do as a girl if you don't marry?

9
00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.740
Mom did all this for your own good

10
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.220
Why don't you understand?

11
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.740
I understand, how do you want me to understand?

12
00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:34.100
Have you ever asked if this is what I want?

13
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.060
I married someone I didn't love

14
00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.820
Will I be happy with you?

15
00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.820
I kind of know why you blocked me from running away from marriage today

16
00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.660
Is it because of this little white face?

17
00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.860
He was the one who cowardly ran away from your marriage, right?

18
00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:54.040
I'm cowardly

19
00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:55.300
He ran away from marriage

20
00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.660
Auntie, you are his biological mother

21
00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:04.980
You have to kill him to be interested

22
00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.660
What are you?

23
00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:09.400
I was talking to my daughter.

24
00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.020
Where is it your turn to interject? Enough

25
00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:13.380
Mom

26
00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.460
You have known my character since I was a child

27
00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.760
No one can change what I decide

28
00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.220
This has nothing to do with couples today

29
00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.220
What do you have I come for me

30
00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:27.480
Nan Nan

31
00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.740
You would never talk to me like that

32
00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:33.660
Mom

33
00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.480
You wouldn't do that to me before.

34
00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:39.700
Why don't you understand?

35
00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:46.780
Daughter is big

36
00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.940
I can't listen to the persuasion

37
00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:51.940
Never mind.

38
00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.020
I don't care.

39
00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.060
Go and explain it to the rich family yourself
