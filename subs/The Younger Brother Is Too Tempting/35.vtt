00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:06.080
Vice President

2
00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:09.920
Are you really sure you want to do this?

3
00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:13.660
What if I took down Fuji Group just for him?

4
00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:15.620
This is the only guarantee I give him

5
00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:21.420
Oh, by the way, let's check again who went to my sister's mother's house last night

6
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.300
I'd like to see who it is

7
00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:28.380
Even my people are moved. It's Nan Nan

8
00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.060
Find a private investigator

9
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:32.000
Don't use us

10
00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.020
Vice President, what do you mean?

11
00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.580
You can do so many things and still hide yourself

12
00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.780
I can't think of anyone else but him.

13
00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:43.100
Clever

14
00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.380
I just didn't expect him to target my sister so early

15
00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.700
The person who hurt his sister

16
00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.020
I'm going to make them pay

17
00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:08.640
Sister, I knew I was wrong this time.

18
00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.120
I won't lie to you again.

19
00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:11.620
And I have

20
00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:13.940
Let's get a divorce.

21
00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.500
Why sister

22
00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.820
But I remember you clearly told me that you wouldn't want me

23
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.140
So what you said is a lie.

24
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.780
We are working together

25
00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.460
Now I, as Party A, have the right to terminate the cooperation.

26
00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.300
I'll call you pennies for the money

27
00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.100
We won't have anything to do with each other
