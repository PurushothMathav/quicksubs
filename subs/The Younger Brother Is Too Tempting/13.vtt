1
00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:02.100
divorce

2
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:04.400
Right

3
00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.600
Sunan, you are 28 years old.

4
00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.140
How old are you?

5
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:11.200
If you go out with him

6
00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:12.580
What would people say about you?

7
00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:14.420
Say your old cow eats tender grass

8
00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:16.900
I never cared what people said

9
00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:19.200
Mom, you told me

10
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:23.320
As long as you get married, you can't find someone so much younger than you, can you?

11
00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:26.300
What's wrong with the person I introduced to you?

12
00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:27.900
People have money

13
00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:30.580
He also promised to help you manage the company after marriage

14
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.720
You can take care of your children at home with peace of mind

15
00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:34.600
Mom, what age is this?

16
00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.300
Which law requires women to stay at home with children?

17
00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:42.020
I don't care, this person is not good anyway

18
00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:43.940
I should have given you 20 points in the first place

19
00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.140
Send you directly to work

20
00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:48.140
Must read

21
00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:51.100
After reading it for a few years, my heart has been attracted

22
00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.420
Anyway.

23
00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:56.980
This marriage must be divorced

24
00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:58.500
The sooner the better.

25
00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.700
If it is spread by your second aunt's big tongue

26
00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:03.920
It will be a second marriage in the future

27
00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:05.980
What other man would want you?

28
00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:07.940
Won't work

29
00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.460
Why can't you listen to your advice?

30
00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.780
Mom, it's all for your own good

31
00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:17.260
Sunan

32
00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:23.080
Let's go

33
00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:33.560
Hello Mr. Su

34
00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:34.980
Something big happened
