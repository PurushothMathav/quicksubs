1
00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:01.960
You promised you wouldn't leave me

2
00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:03.420
You won't get used to it, will you?

3
00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:05.200
Renaissance is the company

4
00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:06.300
Don't mess around

5
00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.780
Sister, if you promise me not to divorce, I will let go.

6
00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:11.560
revival

7
00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:16.380
I don't care. If you don't promise me, I won't let go.

8
00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:22.720
Come in please.

9
00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.160
Mr. Su, this is the quarterly summary of our department this month

10
00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:28.100
Take a look.

11
00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.760
Mr. Su, I'll watch it later

12
00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:34.980
You go out first

13
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.360
Mr. Su, are you alright?

14
00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:43.760
Ah it's alright

15
00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:44.960
Accidentally hit my knee

16
00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:46.340
You go out first

17
00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.520
Fuxing signed the agreement and acted according to the contract

18
00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.420
It's not good for you to pester your employer

19
00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:00.900
elder sister

20
00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:03.700
You don't want me, do you?

21
00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:05.340
You are still young

22
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.060
You can meet more and better girls

23
00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.020
But I am different

24
00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.480
I'm not young anymore.

25
00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:13.120
I have to think about my family.

26
00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:14.960
Also consider this company

27
00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.460
Instead of just being happy

28
00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:20.820
Our farce

29
00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.980
It's time to end

30
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.040
Sister, you are thinking of others everywhere.

31
00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:30.300
What about you? Have you ever thought about yourself?
