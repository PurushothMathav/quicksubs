00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:02.040
What is your identity?

2
00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:04.260
What kind of face am I?

3
00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:11.200
Mr. Zhou, maybe this call is a coincidence

4
00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.000
I grew up with Sunan

5
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.040
How can he know any big business?

6
00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:16.700
Yeah.

7
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.280
This time, how does he recognize it?

8
00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:19.700
But next time

9
00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:21.300
Never spare him

10
00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:29.800
Didn't Nan Nan tell you that there is a blind date today?

11
00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.960
Mr. Liu just called to say that you haven't arrived yet

12
00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:33.340
Where are you now?

13
00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.280
Mom, can you stop introducing me to blind dates?

14
00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.220
Like I said, I don't want to get married

15
00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:39.860
Not to mention that Mr. Liu

16
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.600
They are already over 40

17
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.180
It's the Mediterranean.

18
00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:44.660
What's your attitude?

19
00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.300
What's wrong with 40?

20
00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.060
Age hurts

21
00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.380
The Mediterranean shows that he is smart

22
00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.580
He's also the head of a financial company

23
00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.140
You can't find a good man like this with a lantern

24
00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:58.540
Is it as long as I get married?

25
00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:59.520
You are satisfied

26
00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.600
Did you know that you are 28?

27
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:03.880
At your age

28
00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:07.240
Other people's children will run away, and you don't even have a decent partner

29
00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.460
Did you know that Mom will be laughed at by relatives and friends when she goes out?

30
00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:11.480
I'll tell you what.

31
00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:13.640
Or you can go and meet Mr. Liu

32
00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.360
Or you can bring me back a satisfied son-in-law

33
00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:17.940
Otherwise don't come back to see me

34
00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.940
Revival, do you have a girlfriend?

35
00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:24.840
I don't have a girlfriend.

36
00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.900
Sister last night

37
00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:30.300
Just don't have it.

38
00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.260
Collaborate to get married
