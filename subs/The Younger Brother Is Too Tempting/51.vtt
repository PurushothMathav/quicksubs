00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:03.120
Miss Song, you haven't figured out your position yet, have you?

2
00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:08.080
Do you really think that I will marry a woman I don't love for profit?

3
00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:10.220
No, no.

4
00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.300
No, I really like you.

5
00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:15.580
I want to marry you.

6
00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:16.840
Excuse me.

7
00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:17.980
Do you want to marry

8
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:19.780
I don't want to marry

9
00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.180
No no

10
00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.340
Miss Song, you and my brother were childhood sweethearts

11
00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.140
You also know him best

12
00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.180
He became what he is now

13
00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.340
It's not entirely his fault, actually.

14
00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:41.540
What does that mean?

15
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.020
He raised a woman named Su Nan

16
00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.100
I don't know what he did

17
00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:47.480
Let my brother be well

18
00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.960
The vice president of Fuji Group went to work as his assistant

19
00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.060
If he can quit

20
00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.780
Miss Song, if you want to marry my brother

21
00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.900
The obstacles must be cleared first

22
00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:05.620
Sunan

23
00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.580
Mr. Su, the person in charge of the Song family has arrived

24
00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.300
Waiting in the conference room

25
00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.980
Okay, organize the plan for me, and I will not talk about it in person.

26
00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.540
Hello, Miss Song, I am Sunan, the person in charge of docking with you this time.

27
00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.620
This is the plan you gave me

28
00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.300
Take a box of trash used in it to fool

29
00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.820
Mr. Su, you are taking my wig for a fool
