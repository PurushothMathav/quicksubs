00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:03.440
Doctor, how is my mother?

2
00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:04.760
The patient's condition is relatively stable

3
00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:06.940
But it can't stimulate the patient's emotions anymore

4
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.860
I think we all need to calm down for a while

5
00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:16.980
You go back first

6
00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:18.740
I have been in the company recently.

7
00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:20.700
No need to contact, thank you.

8
00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:48.000
Mom, how are you feeling?

9
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.140
What's wrong?

10
00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:52.400
I thought you weren't coming to see me, Mom

11
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.220
What are you talking about?

12
00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.460
Mom is getting old

13
00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.380
It's normal for the body to not keep up.

14
00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:08.600
It's just that you are the only one who is most worried about Mom

15
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.840
You said if mom really left like this

16
00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:13.900
Who will take care of you in the future?

17
00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.020
Grandma, just listen to your mother's advice

18
00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.320
Divorced the father

19
00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.660
Reincarnate this child

20
00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:21.840
You take care of people.

21
00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.300
Work with dignity

22
00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.220
I'm sure he loves you so much

23
00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.100
If this gets out

24
00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.240
Neighbors will envy you for finding such a good man

25
00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.420
A hundred times stronger than that revival mom

26
00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.980
Do you really want to watch your mother die?

27
00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.860
Just be a mother, please, okay?

28
00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.940
OK

29
00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.020
I promise you.

30
00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.260
Divorce with father

31
00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:56.900
Marry couple
