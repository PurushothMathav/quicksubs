00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.420
Father hid his identity to approach you to protect you

2
00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:05.780
I'm sure he told you

3
00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:08.100
His father married another woman

4
00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:11.100
That woman's son and father never got along

5
00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:13.700
If they know of your existence

6
00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:15.900
Your situation will become very dangerous

7
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.880
Sunan, the reason why I tell you this

8
00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.060
It's because my father really likes it

9
00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:23.700
He doesn't want to give up on you.

10
00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.420
If what you say is true

11
00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.980
Then the background information I investigated is very likely to be misleading

12
00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:32.780
Who would do that?

13
00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:35.120
Since that person can release the news

14
00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.380
Realize that your purpose is to understand your relationship

15
00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.140
To find out who's behind it

16
00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.860
We can't hit the well with grass.

17
00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.140
Sister, why are you here? I didn't let you

18
00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.060
Tell me

19
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.600
Silly boy if I don't say

20
00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.120
You two are divorced

21
00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.000
I have something to do, so I'm leaving first

22
00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.980
You two talk slowly

23
00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:04.420
Sister, I'm sorry.

24
00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:06.740
I shouldn't have hidden my identity to approach you

25
00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:08.360
But I promise you.

26
00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:09.640
My feelings for you are genuine

27
00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.580
It's not the kind of play they say

28
00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:12.900
and

29
00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.460
I didn't mean to hide my identity and get close to you

30
00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:19.100
Sister can forgive me

31
00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.500
You admit you're wrong.

32
00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.620
Is your consciousness quite high?

33
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.500
Sister, have you forgiven me?
