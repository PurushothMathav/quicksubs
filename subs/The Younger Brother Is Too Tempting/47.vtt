00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:05.400
recently

2
00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:07.300
It hurts you.

3
00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:12.740
You go out to play

4
00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:14.500
I don't want you to hit me alone

5
00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.620
Sister, do you want to throw me away again?

6
00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:22.540
But this time I won't go

7
00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.260
I will always stay by your side to accompany you to the end

8
00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:26.800
Don't talk

9
00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.540
Why can't you get rid of the shit that was just about to die?

10
00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.500
Are you waiting in your heart to see my joke?

11
00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.020
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to get mad at you

12
00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.020
Don't take it to heart

13
00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:51.980
Sister, I know.

14
00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:55.900
At this moment, you especially want to find someone to talk to

15
00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:57.340
It doesn't matter.

16
00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.780
If you want to hit, don't scold.

17
00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:01.140
Just don't fight

18
00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.500
You will never leave

19
00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:04.180
I don't believe it.

20
00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:07.500
Do you believe it or not?

21
00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:26.440
Miss you

22
00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.340
Such a handsome boy

23
00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:40.260
How can it be a little white face who eats soft rice?

24
00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.480
Sister, I saw you were tired yesterday.

25
00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:49.260
I made you some porridge myself

26
00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.180
Why don't you try it?

27
00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.440
You don't have to cook.

28
00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:57.860
I asked my aunt to cook

29
00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.620
Would it be my pleasure to cook for my sister once?

30
00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.700
The same is true for you after payment, right?
