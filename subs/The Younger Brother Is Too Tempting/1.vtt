00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:09.940
Don't call me Mr. Su

2
00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.540
Call me sister

3
00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.200
Mr. Su is really massive

4
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.080
No wonder the business is so big

5
00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:18.220
Mr. Lai Su

6
00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.980
I'll give you a toast

7
00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.740
Come on, Mr. Su, I'll toast you again

8
00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:34.720
Hello Mr. Su, your new special place has arrived

9
00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:35.760
I've asked him to pick you up.

10
00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:37.300
Yeah, OK.

11
00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.480
Mr. Su, you are drunk

12
00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:48.260
Why don't we both come and see you off?

13
00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.620
Everyone, Mr. Su, I'll just deliver it

14
00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.100
The old color is empty.

15
00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.460
Sister, was it me last night?

16
00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.300
What happened last night was an accident

17
00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:33.820
I will not be responsible.

18
00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.660
Don't be delusional

19
00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:38.820
We're all adults.

20
00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:40.780
There's nothing to worry about

21
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.860
There's 200,000 in here. Let's pretend nothing happened

22
00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:52.540
You're just as heartless as ever

23
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.600
The people who hurt my sister last night

24
00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:06.960
Teach them a lesson

25
00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:10.860
I don't want them to show up in my sister's partner again

26
00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.300
Since you want to distance our relationship so much

27
00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:17.340
Then I won't let you
