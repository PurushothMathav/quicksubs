00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:03.700
Second aunt, do you really know that I have evidence?

2
00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:10.180
The last time I saw you at the hotel, I was moved

3
00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:12.580
This Zhou Chengfei was also forced

4
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:16.020
Father, I am the one who really likes you

5
00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:19.700
Su Yi, what else do you have to say?

6
00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:24.380
It was you who took the initiative to climb into my bed

7
00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.340
Now say I forced you

8
00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:31.300
Su Yiyi, I, I, I'll give you two, okay?

9
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:32.820
Chen Fei

10
00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.720
He must have made up this recording

11
00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:36.720
Will affect me

12
00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:38.380
You have to believe me.

13
00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:41.860
Stinky girl, you think I'm stupid

14
00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.740
Chen Fei, listen to me explain

15
00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:50.040
Cousin husband and cousin often say you can't

16
00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:51.560
Are you clamoring to divorce you?

17
00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:54.400
Shut up, I said I regret marrying him

18
00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.540
When did I say that?

19
00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:57.940
Ah you

20
00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.100
Regret marrying me, right?

21
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:02.340
OK

22
00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:07.180
See you tomorrow at the Civil Affairs Bureau, ah, Chen Fei.

23
00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.140
Ah, Chen Fei! Ah!

24
00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.080
Song Nan, this is a misunderstanding

25
00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.140
Why do you bother?

26
00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.120
A good family was ruined by you like this

27
00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:23.720
Are you happy now?

28
00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:25.760
It's a 2nd-round Moderation thing

29
00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:27.040
It's all my fault

30
00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:28.360
I shouldn't have recorded

31
00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.780
I shouldn't have shown you the evidence

32
00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:31.960
It's all my fault

33
00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:35.140
20 This is obviously Su Yiyi's fault

34
00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.100
Where do you have the face to accuse us?

35
00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.920
you

36
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.060
I told you too much

37
00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:45.620
Sister-in-law, your daughter is ruthless, right?

38
00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:51.020
If I don't help you in the future, don't say I don't make it clear

39
00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:54.940
He is 20 he is 20

40
00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.480
Grandma, let's use what your cousin did wrong

41
00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:01.260
Is it right to take 10,000 steps back and talk about Fuxing Hall?
