00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:01.966
Presumptuous what are you

2
00:00:01.966 --> 00:00:03.400
How dare you disrespect my big brother

3
00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:04.733
Brother Bukit is my good friend.

4
00:00:04.733 --> 00:00:05.966
Stop yelling at him

5
00:00:05.966 --> 00:00:06.800
He actually said my brother

6
00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:08.966
Will bow and apologize to an inferior person like him

7
00:00:08.966 --> 00:00:09.900
How can I bear it?

8
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.066
I'm telling the truth

9
00:00:12.066 --> 00:00:13.766
And I'm generous

10
00:00:13.766 --> 00:00:16.466
Otherwise, make him kneel down and admit his mistake

11
00:00:16.466 --> 00:00:18.100
He can only bow his head

12
00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:19.700
You insult my brother so much

13
00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:21.166
Do you really not want to live?

14
00:00:21.166 --> 00:00:23.400
Enough, you cover the water, I told you

15
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.266
Brother Wuji is my closest relative and most respected person

16
00:00:25.266 --> 00:00:26.733
How dare you speak out?

17
00:00:26.733 --> 00:00:28.800
Did you take what I said seriously?

18
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:29.933
I don't ever want to see you again.

19
00:00:29.933 --> 00:00:31.266
Destiny, listen to my explanation

20
00:00:31.266 --> 00:00:32.300
Brother Wuji, let's go

21
00:00:35.366 --> 00:00:38.566
Brother Fearless relies on his family background

22
00:00:38.566 --> 00:00:40.366
Never take anyone seriously

23
00:00:40.366 --> 00:00:41.833
Don't know him in general

24
00:00:41.933 --> 00:00:44.100
That kid seems to like you

25
00:00:44.333 --> 00:00:46.666
He did chase me.

26
00:00:46.666 --> 00:00:48.100
But I don't like him

27
00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:49.566
Arrogant aristocrat

28
00:00:49.566 --> 00:00:51.466
I only have you in my heart, brother Wuji

29
00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:57.966
Mowgli, my mom loves jewelry

30
00:00:57.966 --> 00:00:59.366
Let's go in and have a look.

31
00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:07.700
Hello Miss Zhang

32
00:01:07.933 --> 00:01:08.933
You don't have to stay with me.

33
00:01:08.933 --> 00:01:10.033
We read English by ourselves

34
00:01:10.166 --> 00:01:11.066
Don't ignore me

35
00:01:11.066 --> 00:01:12.300
Let me explain, okay?

36
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:13.800
Why are you following me again?

37
00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.866
Didn't I say I don't want to see you anymore?

38
00:01:16.066 --> 00:01:17.666
I'm going to pick out my mom's birthday present now

39
00:01:17.666 --> 00:01:19.100
Don't bother me get out
