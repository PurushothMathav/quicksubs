00:00:00.766 --> 00:00:04.233
Xingtian, do you know that those who betray the Wuji Temple will be killed without mercy?

2
00:00:04.533 --> 00:00:05.366
Come

3
00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:07.700
Take down all these daring things for me

4
00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:09.300
Stop shouting

5
00:00:10.366 --> 00:00:13.900
Your people and the Withered Probe of the Promise Temple in the North Sea

6
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.600
I cleared it all

7
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.900
Get to know each other and surrender quickly

8
00:00:18.266 --> 00:00:20.900
Or you make me comfortable

9
00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:22.800
I can ask Jiang Shao for a favor

10
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:23.866
Have your life

11
00:00:23.866 --> 00:00:27.800
Hahaha, you two-faced shameless villain

12
00:00:28.333 --> 00:00:30.200
I, Qiao Zixi, swear to die filial piety

13
00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.400
Mr. Xiao's life and death are unknown

14
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.833
Xiao Wuji, I'll give you a chance too

15
00:00:35.866 --> 00:00:38.366
As long as you kneel down and beg for mercy to us now

16
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.833
How about I let you leave Beihai safely?

17
00:00:43.333 --> 00:00:45.800
I, Xiao Wuji, kneel in the sky

18
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.600
Kneel in the middle of the kneeling Buddha

19
00:00:49.066 --> 00:00:51.700
The kings of the world have never made me bow my head

20
00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.500
You can match anything.

21
00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:57.933
Good words are hard to persuade

22
00:00:57.933 --> 00:00:59.033
Damn ghost

23
00:00:59.166 --> 00:01:00.433
If so

24
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.666
I have nothing more to say

25
00:01:03.133 --> 00:01:06.466
After Xing Tian killed him

26
00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.500
You are the emperor under the North Sea

27
00:01:09.766 --> 00:01:10.566
Humph

28
00:01:11.166 --> 00:01:12.233
Mr. Xiao

29
00:01:12.266 --> 00:01:14.266
For the sake of you, my master and servant

30
00:01:14.266 --> 00:01:16.066
I could leave you whole

31
00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.200
Someone come to me

32
00:01:22.866 --> 00:01:25.033
Those who dare to hurt my lord die
