00:00:01.333 --> 00:00:03.800
How far is Fearless Brother Chen Jiashang?

2
00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:05.100
Although domineering

3
00:00:05.133 --> 00:00:06.800
But they are all my old classmates

4
00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:07.933
You don't know them in general

5
00:00:07.933 --> 00:00:09.733
I wanted to punish them for little things

6
00:00:09.733 --> 00:00:10.933
Since you said so

7
00:00:10.933 --> 00:00:12.033
Then forget it.

8
00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:13.266
As long as you are happy.

9
00:00:13.266 --> 00:00:14.600
I would do anything

10
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:17.100
I knew Fearless would be the best for me

11
00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:20.833
Who is it that doesn't walk with eyes?

12
00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:23.600
Who am I?

13
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.266
So it was Zhao Muyan?

14
00:00:26.333 --> 00:00:28.100
Susan, is that you?

15
00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:29.200
Long time no see.

16
00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.266
Why is Sun Tzu Feng here?

17
00:00:32.266 --> 00:00:34.266
Zifeng is now my boyfriend

18
00:00:34.333 --> 00:00:37.533
Of course he wants to accompany me to the reunion.

19
00:00:37.533 --> 00:00:39.800
I forgot he was your ex-boyfriend

20
00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:40.866
Sorry.

21
00:00:40.866 --> 00:00:42.400
I didn't mean to break your heart.

22
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.733
I haven't seen the geese for so many years

23
00:00:44.733 --> 00:00:46.900
You are getting more and more beautiful.

24
00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.033
Hello, my name is Xiao Wuxi

25
00:00:50.466 --> 00:00:51.966
It's Mu Yan's boyfriend

26
00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.466
Zhao Muyan, so this is your new boyfriend?

27
00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.066
Dressed so shabby

28
00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:00.966
Not worthy of you at all

29
00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.133
Ah, I see.

30
00:01:03.133 --> 00:01:06.166
It must be because you have been single for a long time and are unbearably lonely.

31
00:01:06.266 --> 00:01:08.666
That's why you need all the trash

32
00:01:08.666 --> 00:01:10.166
It's Muyan

33
00:01:10.566 --> 00:01:12.066
Even if I don't want you anymore

34
00:01:12.066 --> 00:01:15.366
You don't need to find this kind of thing to wronge yourself

35
00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.000
If you are really lonely

36
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.800
Tell me for the love of the past

37
00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.833
I'll satisfy you.
