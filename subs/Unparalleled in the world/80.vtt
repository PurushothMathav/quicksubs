1
00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:01.266
Even so

2
00:00:01.333 --> 00:00:02.766
He is Konoha's boyfriend after all

3
00:00:02.766 --> 00:00:05.133
If so, everyone will give me face

4
00:00:05.133 --> 00:00:06.800
How about writing this off?

5
00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:09.800
You are obviously favoring Zhao Konoha

6
00:00:10.266 --> 00:00:12.300
Since Brother Gu said so

7
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.100
Only the reason to disagree is good

8
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.200
Today is the reunion

9
00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.066
Everyone hasn't seen you in a long time

10
00:00:19.066 --> 00:00:21.366
Be sure to continue this classmate's shadow

11
00:00:21.366 --> 00:00:23.500
Don't talk about unhappy things.

12
00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:25.266
Of course.

13
00:00:25.366 --> 00:00:27.000
Oh, by the way, Gu Xiong

14
00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:31.566
I heard that you are in charge of Beihai on behalf of Wuji Store

15
00:00:32.733 --> 00:00:35.266
It must be very popular in the store

16
00:00:35.266 --> 00:00:36.900
If there is any big project in the future

17
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.000
But think of my brother and I, the United Chamber of Commerce?

18
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:39.900
Definitely. Definitely.

19
00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:41.966
In fact, in the store these years

20
00:00:41.966 --> 00:00:43.200
I didn't get much credit for that.

21
00:00:43.533 --> 00:00:45.466
You put me in such a high position this time

22
00:00:45.466 --> 00:00:46.333
Neither did I.

23
00:00:46.333 --> 00:00:47.866
Brother Gu, you are humble

24
00:00:47.866 --> 00:00:49.333
With the power of my brother

25
00:00:49.333 --> 00:00:51.533
It will rise step by step in the future

26
00:00:51.533 --> 00:00:52.666
Bright future

27
00:00:53.366 --> 00:00:55.666
Waiter serves wine

28
00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.900
Let's toast my aunt together

29
00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:59.166
Don't shout

30
00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.433
I brought a bottle of Peerless Aging this time

31
00:01:02.566 --> 00:01:03.600
Here you are.

32
00:01:05.266 --> 00:01:06.400
Peerless Aging

33
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:07.500
You don't know.

34
00:01:07.766 --> 00:01:11.300
This unparalleled aged wine is a fine wine brewed by Wuji Electric

35
00:01:11.333 --> 00:01:12.833
The King of Baijiu

36
00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:16.033
Every bottle is priceless

37
00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.800
Isn't that more expensive than gold?

38
00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.000
It's just that the output of this matchless aging is rare

39
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.700
It's not for sale.

40
00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:25.300
Except for the man with the inorganic sword

41
00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:26.533
You can taste it.

42
00:01:26.533 --> 00:01:28.233
There are only a few kings

43
00:01:28.266 --> 00:01:30.300
And some of the top financial giants

44
00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:31.366
To drink

45
00:01:31.366 --> 00:01:33.900
But today because I can't

46
00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.900
We can taste such fine wine

47
00:01:35.966 --> 00:01:37.466
Thanks a lot.
