00:00:00.466 --> 00:00:03.800
It turned out to be the four major things of electrodeless electricity

2
00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:06.166
It's over, it's dead

3
00:00:06.166 --> 00:00:07.533
Xiaotian, what's wrong with you?

4
00:00:07.533 --> 00:00:08.833
Just a phone call.

5
00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:10.866
We have more than a thousand good players lying in ambush outside

6
00:00:10.866 --> 00:00:12.433
You can charge between areas

7
00:00:13.266 --> 00:00:15.233
Although these four men are armed

8
00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.133
But it will also be torn to pieces immediately

9
00:00:17.133 --> 00:00:18.300
This explanation is

10
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.633
Possessing the best combat power in the world

11
00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:24.400
Five years ago, just the four of them

12
00:00:24.466 --> 00:00:26.733
Swept all the forces in the south

13
00:00:26.733 --> 00:00:27.600
and

14
00:00:28.133 --> 00:00:30.266
They are the removal of the Lord of Wuji Palace

15
00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:34.700
Only the Palace Master of Wuji can mediate and order

16
00:00:36.533 --> 00:00:38.466
How to say little Wu Qi

17
00:00:38.866 --> 00:00:40.266
You are the owner of Promise

18
00:00:41.466 --> 00:00:45.100
I said I'm a man standing on top of the sky

19
00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:48.100
It is impossible for the Promise shopkeeper to dominate the entire Northern Regions

20
00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.266
There are more than 300,000 elite soldiers under his command

21
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.200
Power is all over the world

22
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.066
There was a sense of awe.

23
00:00:54.066 --> 00:00:55.666
Even kneel down to its handrail

24
00:00:55.666 --> 00:00:57.433
Such a godlike figure

25
00:00:57.466 --> 00:00:58.666
How could it be you?

26
00:00:58.666 --> 00:01:00.800
You blind thing

27
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.033
How can you see the real dragon?

28
00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:05.400
Xiao Wuji

29
00:01:06.066 --> 00:01:08.200
What if you are the owner of the Promise Palace?

30
00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.766
You are unparalleled in the world

31
00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:11.766
Don't pay attention to everyone

32
00:01:11.766 --> 00:01:12.800
I'll tell you what.

33
00:01:12.966 --> 00:01:15.333
Will die today

34
00:01:15.333 --> 00:01:18.366
This is about to happen, and he still speaks wildly

35
00:01:18.566 --> 00:01:19.866
I'd like to see it

36
00:01:20.166 --> 00:01:21.700
How can you kill me?

37
00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.266
Crape myrtle hands-on

38
00:01:24.066 --> 00:01:24.866
Yes
