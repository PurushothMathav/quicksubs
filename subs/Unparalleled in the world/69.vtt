1
00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:01.700
Even the United Chamber of Commerce

2
00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:03.266
Sun Chenglong compared to me

3
00:00:03.366 --> 00:00:05.266
Identity is also a world difference

4
00:00:05.266 --> 00:00:07.566
He doesn't even deserve to carry my shoes

5
00:00:07.666 --> 00:00:10.033
This is the existence of the four major Bijin families

6
00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:11.566
What are you?

7
00:00:11.566 --> 00:00:13.233
Dare to disrespect his master

8
00:00:13.366 --> 00:00:15.600
It's Sun Chenglong standing in front of me

9
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.266
In that case, I will still say

10
00:00:17.266 --> 00:00:18.400
He just nodded and smiled

11
00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:19.200
Unsolvable

12
00:00:19.533 --> 00:00:21.766
If Mr. Sun hears what you just said

13
00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.066
Even if there is wood as a backer

14
00:00:24.366 --> 00:00:25.800
You must be dead

15
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.066
Count me alive

16
00:00:28.666 --> 00:00:30.266
Probably heard my name

17
00:00:30.366 --> 00:00:31.866
He should be scared to pee

18
00:00:31.866 --> 00:00:34.666
Xiao Buji, you want to show off in front of Mu Yan

19
00:00:34.666 --> 00:00:35.600
You have to have believers

20
00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.166
You're so wild

21
00:00:37.166 --> 00:00:38.066
arrogant and domineering

22
00:00:38.066 --> 00:00:39.066
Are you really not afraid of death?

23
00:00:39.066 --> 00:00:40.900
Someone asked me that last time.

24
00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:43.533
And now you're dead. Oh, yeah.

25
00:00:43.533 --> 00:00:45.000
Sun Chenglong was also present

26
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:45.966
You can ask him.

27
00:00:45.966 --> 00:00:47.666
Presumptuous Xiao Wujie

28
00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:49.400
You keep saying things

29
00:00:49.566 --> 00:00:50.833
Unforgivable sin

30
00:00:51.166 --> 00:00:53.566
This will let you know the consequences of insulting Mr. Sun

31
00:00:53.566 --> 00:00:54.433
Enough

32
00:00:55.533 --> 00:00:57.100
Xiao Wuji is my boyfriend

33
00:00:57.366 --> 00:00:59.266
You are so tit for tat

34
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.133
And did you take me seriously?

35
00:01:01.133 --> 00:01:03.300
Master Mu, this kid relies on his relationship with you

36
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.066
Open mouth

37
00:01:04.066 --> 00:01:04.800
hubris

38
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.966
If this goes on, you will definitely get into trouble

39
00:01:06.966 --> 00:01:08.766
We are asking you to educate him.

40
00:01:08.766 --> 00:01:10.033
What does it have to do with you?

41
00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:11.800
Let's go in.

42
00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.233
Don't promise them two scum
