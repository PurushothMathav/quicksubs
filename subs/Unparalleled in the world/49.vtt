00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:02.066
Shut up for me

2
00:00:02.066 --> 00:00:04.166
What kind of decency does it make to be noisy?

3
00:00:05.133 --> 00:00:05.933
Mom

4
00:00:05.933 --> 00:00:08.400
Brother Fearless knows that it will be your birthday in a few days

5
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:09.900
I have a special gift for you.

6
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.266
This is my heart

7
00:00:11.366 --> 00:00:13.200
Auntie wishes you a happy birthday in advance.

8
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.200
Fushou Centennial

9
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.333
What decent thing can he send?

10
00:00:17.333 --> 00:00:20.700
Even the packaging doesn't look expensive.

11
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:24.100
In the afternoon festival, our Zhang family has countless treasures

12
00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:26.100
You mustn't take any junk

13
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:27.433
Just to fool my mom

14
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.833
It's probably not as big as tens of grams.

15
00:00:38.933 --> 00:00:41.266
Blue diamonds with such a pure texture

16
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:42.733
It's the first time I've seen you.

17
00:00:42.733 --> 00:00:44.133
This blue dream

18
00:00:44.133 --> 00:00:46.333
It used to be the treasure of Queen Catherine

19
00:00:46.333 --> 00:00:47.566
priceless

20
00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.566
Thanks, I love it.

21
00:00:50.566 --> 00:00:52.000
You have a heart

22
00:00:52.566 --> 00:00:54.733
Impossible he's a lowly pariah

23
00:00:54.733 --> 00:00:56.666
How could it be possible to take out such a precious blue diamond?

24
00:00:56.733 --> 00:00:59.166
This must be a fake. Mom has treasured gems for years

25
00:00:59.166 --> 00:01:00.300
If it is fake

26
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.100
How could you hide it from him?

27
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.166
Even if true

28
00:01:04.266 --> 00:01:06.366
He must have stolen it.

29
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.100
Even if it's not stolen

30
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.566
He must have cheated it from another woman

31
00:01:10.566 --> 00:01:12.233
A soft rice guy like him

32
00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.866
The best way to coax women is enough

33
00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:16.200
I already said it.

34
00:01:16.466 --> 00:01:18.033
Wuji is his own family

35
00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.600
The two of you have repeatedly made provocative remarks

36
00:01:20.766 --> 00:01:22.666
If you dare to speak again, get me out

37
00:01:22.666 --> 00:01:24.566
Why did Uncle Zhang get so angry?

38
00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.700
Are you blaming me for being late?
