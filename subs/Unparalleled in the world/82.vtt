1
00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.200
Brother Wuji is not as bad as you think

2
00:00:03.533 --> 00:00:04.833
He's actually your father

3
00:00:05.066 --> 00:00:07.166
I'm looking at the friendship between classmates for many years

4
00:00:07.166 --> 00:00:08.666
It just smoked to remind you.

5
00:00:08.666 --> 00:00:09.466
I advise you.

6
00:00:09.466 --> 00:00:11.466
Or hurry up and break up with this Xiao Wuji

7
00:00:11.466 --> 00:00:14.366
Otherwise, some of the wine you regret has not been drunk yet.

8
00:00:14.366 --> 00:00:15.666
Why are you drunk?

9
00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:18.100
It's all blind stuff

10
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.033
Stop talking nonsense

11
00:00:20.066 --> 00:00:22.300
Otherwise, you must regret it.

12
00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.900
Brother Xiao Wuji is here

13
00:00:25.066 --> 00:00:26.600
How dare you be so arrogant?

14
00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.266
I think the most tired person is you

15
00:00:29.266 --> 00:00:32.100
I know what we just said hurt your self-esteem

16
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:34.300
But don't think you just need to say a few big words

17
00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.100
It will save your face

18
00:00:36.366 --> 00:00:39.200
The result will only make you more embarrassed

19
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.333
Okay, everyone, say less

20
00:00:41.333 --> 00:00:43.333
I have already poured this wine

21
00:00:43.333 --> 00:00:46.000
If you don't drink it, you won't live up to such a fine wine

22
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:46.600
come

23
00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.366
I propose a toast to everyone's classmates

24
00:00:54.466 --> 00:00:55.733
Soft taste

25
00:00:55.733 --> 00:00:56.900
Taste glycol

26
00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.700
Sure enough, it's a good wine

27
00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.533
That's the king of Baijiu anyway

28
00:01:01.533 --> 00:01:02.900
How can it be a false name?

29
00:01:04.866 --> 00:01:07.200
This wine is fake

30
00:01:08.733 --> 00:01:11.200
You are talking nonsense

31
00:01:11.333 --> 00:01:13.233
This is the wine brought by Brother Gu.

32
00:01:13.466 --> 00:01:14.533
How could it be fake?

33
00:01:14.533 --> 00:01:16.500
A lowly pariah like you

34
00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.500
How could I have drunk such a fine wine?

35
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.633
How can you tell the difference between true and false wine?

36
00:01:20.766 --> 00:01:22.500
I drink a lot of wine

37
00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.166
Especially Wushuang Craft Brewing

38
00:01:25.166 --> 00:01:26.600
Almost a must-drink every day

39
00:01:26.866 --> 00:01:28.800
Although this wine has a soft taste

40
00:01:28.866 --> 00:01:30.200
But not strong enough

41
00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:31.633
Although it is a good wine

42
00:01:31.933 --> 00:01:33.800
But not Peerless Craft Brewing
