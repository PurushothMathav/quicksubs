1
00:00:01.566 --> 00:00:02.666
I'm so sorry, Mr. Li

2
00:00:02.666 --> 00:00:05.200
This blue dream was borrowed by our boss.

3
00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:06.466
Just put it in the store for display.

4
00:00:06.466 --> 00:00:07.466
Not for sale

5
00:00:07.466 --> 00:00:09.200
I accidentally took it wrong just now.

6
00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.300
Please choose another one. What do you mean you got it wrong?

7
00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:13.066
Since it is served, there is no reason not to sell it.

8
00:00:13.066 --> 00:00:13.866
Li Fushui

9
00:00:13.866 --> 00:00:15.566
What kind of prestige are you playing with a little girl?

10
00:00:15.566 --> 00:00:17.200
I didn't want you to buy it anyway.

11
00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.800
I think it's okay, I'm going to order this diamond

12
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.266
Tell your store manager

13
00:00:21.266 --> 00:00:22.566
I'll take this diamond.

14
00:00:22.566 --> 00:00:24.000
He can talk about the price

15
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.200
I can afford hundreds of millions.

16
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.300
Unexpectedly, the second young master of the Li family in Beihai

17
00:00:31.333 --> 00:00:32.966
Only buy and sell

18
00:00:32.966 --> 00:00:34.166
Big bully small

19
00:00:34.366 --> 00:00:36.900
Better than those skinny rascals out there

20
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:38.166
A scumbag like you

21
00:00:38.166 --> 00:00:40.033
Where can I see the value of this blue diamond?

22
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.100
Besides, I can't understand how I feel about seeking truth

23
00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:44.866
Not to mention diamonds of this caliber

24
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.033
It's a treasure in your eyes

25
00:00:47.066 --> 00:00:48.866
I have countless more

26
00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:50.400
That sucks.

27
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.066
Why don't you say you own the world

28
00:00:52.066 --> 00:00:53.400
Power is all over the world

29
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.866
I do stand on the clouds and overlook the world

30
00:00:57.266 --> 00:00:59.233
You're not afraid to blow up the day

31
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:00.900
Since you treasure countless things

32
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:02.400
Then do you recognize this blue diamond?

33
00:01:02.466 --> 00:01:05.000
This blue diamond is called Blue Dream

34
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.600
Originally set on Queen Catherine's scepter

35
00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:08.900
Then the empire fell

36
00:01:09.266 --> 00:01:10.466
Lost World

37
00:01:10.566 --> 00:01:11.666
After several turnarounds

38
00:01:11.666 --> 00:01:13.200
Finally in my hands
