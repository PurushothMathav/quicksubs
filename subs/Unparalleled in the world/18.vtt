00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:01.700
Ah!

2
00:00:02.133 --> 00:00:03.233
Invincible bracelet

3
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.866
You are wearing an invincible bracelet.

4
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:07.800
You know him too?

5
00:00:09.133 --> 00:00:11.500
For love Xingtian pays homage to the envoy of Wuji Temple

6
00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:13.200
God what are you doing

7
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.800
Isn't it just a broken bracelet?

8
00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:16.700
I keep my soul

9
00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:18.700
That is the exclusive token of the Promise Hall

10
00:00:19.166 --> 00:00:21.466
Only the core Venerable of the Promise Palace can have it

11
00:00:21.933 --> 00:00:25.200
Anyone who pays birth can mobilize all the nourishment of the Wuji Temple

12
00:00:25.466 --> 00:00:27.300
The leaders of various countries do not dare to ask for alms

13
00:00:27.333 --> 00:00:28.366
Kneel down

14
00:00:28.933 --> 00:00:30.100
Meet Mr. Zhou

15
00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:34.833
I am the Swordsman

16
00:00:35.366 --> 00:00:36.466
Who the hell is he?

17
00:00:36.466 --> 00:00:39.433
Mr. Xiao didn't know your identity before

18
00:00:40.066 --> 00:00:41.000
Offended you

19
00:00:41.266 --> 00:00:43.000
suffered before

20
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.433
How dare I convict you of being the king of the North Sea?

21
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:49.700
Yeah!

22
00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:50.900
Ah!

23
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.000
Offended Mr. Xiao

24
00:00:53.266 --> 00:00:54.300
Should punish himself

25
00:00:54.366 --> 00:00:55.266
This demon

26
00:00:55.566 --> 00:00:58.566
Just treat it as the end of the world with you

27
00:00:58.566 --> 00:01:00.033
I told you before.

28
00:01:00.166 --> 00:01:01.166
See again

29
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.466
It will kill him

30
00:01:03.466 --> 00:01:05.066
Come on god

31
00:01:05.133 --> 00:01:06.766
Tianye Chen Yao Cave

32
00:01:06.933 --> 00:01:08.766
Every time I offend Mr. Hugh

33
00:01:08.766 --> 00:01:10.800
Drink it and serve it smartly

34
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:11.766
Mr. Hugh?

35
00:01:11.933 --> 00:01:13.066
Give me a break, Mr. Shaw

36
00:01:13.066 --> 00:01:14.700
I don't dare anymore.

37
00:01:14.866 --> 00:01:15.833
today

38
00:01:16.733 --> 00:01:18.600
This time it's a small show

39
00:01:18.933 --> 00:01:19.966
Don't care about you

40
00:01:19.966 --> 00:01:21.566
Take care of your people in the future

41
00:01:21.566 --> 00:01:22.866
Next time

42
00:01:22.866 --> 00:01:25.000
But it's not as simple as breaking an arm

43
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.366
It's a cry of gratitude

44
00:01:28.133 --> 00:01:28.966
roll

45
00:01:32.566 --> 00:01:33.833
Uh-huh.

46
00:01:35.333 --> 00:01:38.600
Wang Shao, now it's your turn.
