00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:00.966
No.

2
00:00:01.666 --> 00:00:02.466
Xiao Wuji

3
00:00:02.766 --> 00:00:05.800
What you mean is that Brother Gu lied to us.

4
00:00:05.966 --> 00:00:07.366
What a joke!

5
00:00:07.366 --> 00:00:08.700
What is Brother Gu's identity?

6
00:00:08.766 --> 00:00:10.766
How could you do such a shameless situation?

7
00:00:10.766 --> 00:00:13.666
Xiao Wuji, I think you are jealous of Gu Qing

8
00:00:13.666 --> 00:00:15.400
So I deliberately said to frame it

9
00:00:15.966 --> 00:00:17.933
In vain, he still favors you everywhere

10
00:00:17.933 --> 00:00:20.266
Even at the cost of face to exempt you from responsibility

11
00:00:20.566 --> 00:00:22.566
And you are so vengeful

12
00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:24.466
It's despicable and shameless

13
00:00:24.466 --> 00:00:26.000
Brother Wuji is not such a person

14
00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.600
If he says the wine is fake, it must be fake

15
00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.700
Zhao Muyan, the facts are in front of you

16
00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:32.266
You are still protecting Xiao Wuji

17
00:00:32.266 --> 00:00:34.466
I see that the two of you are simply the sum of a hill

18
00:00:34.466 --> 00:00:35.566
It's not a good thing

19
00:00:35.566 --> 00:00:38.266
I brought a bottle of Peerless Craft Brew today

20
00:00:38.533 --> 00:00:39.633
True or False

21
00:00:39.666 --> 00:00:40.700
one stroke

22
00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.066
Hahahaha

23
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:43.733
You just acted so realistically

24
00:00:43.733 --> 00:00:45.133
I almost believed it

25
00:00:45.133 --> 00:00:46.766
You take out a broken bottle.

26
00:00:47.333 --> 00:00:49.933
Did you pick this bottle up from the road?

27
00:00:49.933 --> 00:00:52.200
Xiao Wuji, don't hold on anymore

28
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.300
Like Peerless Craft Brewing

29
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.066
Such a priceless wine

30
00:00:55.066 --> 00:00:57.066
How could it be in this broken bottle?

31
00:00:57.066 --> 00:00:58.466
Believe it or not

32
00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.066
I don't believe it anyway

33
00:01:00.066 --> 00:01:00.733
Xiao Wuji

34
00:01:00.733 --> 00:01:03.200
Do you really want to compare? Look at Mu Yan's face

35
00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.466
I advise you

36
00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.500
It's too late to admit it's wrong now

37
00:01:06.966 --> 00:01:08.566
Once this lid is opened

38
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.266
It's not as simple as admitting fault
