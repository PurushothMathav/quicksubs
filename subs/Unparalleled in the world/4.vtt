00:00:00.466 --> 00:00:03.066
How could you say such a thing?

2
00:00:03.366 --> 00:00:04.800
The simple you

3
00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.366
How did it become so realistic?

4
00:00:06.366 --> 00:00:08.233
Don't act like you know me well

5
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.900
And in this materialistic society

6
00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:12.766
Is it wrong to be realistic?

7
00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:15.966
You poor boy with nothing

8
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.200
What can you give me?

9
00:00:17.966 --> 00:00:19.566
Mo Yan stop

10
00:00:20.733 --> 00:00:22.100
How dare you!

11
00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:23.700
Dare to take action against us Mu Yan

12
00:00:23.766 --> 00:00:25.666
Somebody teach me a lesson

13
00:00:26.766 --> 00:00:28.600
Sister Han let him go

14
00:00:29.133 --> 00:00:30.666
He saved me just now

15
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:32.300
Xia Wuji

16
00:00:32.966 --> 00:00:34.900
You just saved my life. I'm grateful

17
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.100
But childhood play

18
00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:37.566
Don't mention it again

19
00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.433
Besides, I don't want to see you again.

20
00:00:41.566 --> 00:00:43.200
Don't go, make it clear

21
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.233
Is what Hongyan said not clear enough?

22
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.600
You stinky toad

23
00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:47.900
Want to eat swan meat

24
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.433
You said I want to eat swan meat

25
00:00:51.066 --> 00:00:52.600
Isn't it?

26
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.966
Don't pee and take pictures of yourself

27
00:00:55.333 --> 00:00:57.400
You useless little turtle 3

28
00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.433
It is also worthy to be with us Mu Yan

29
00:00:59.766 --> 00:01:02.066
Xiao Wang, you said I was a little turtle 3.

30
00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:03.966
If I told you

31
00:01:04.533 --> 00:01:05.800
I am powerful

32
00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:07.100
Rich in the world

33
00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.766
The man standing on the top of the world
