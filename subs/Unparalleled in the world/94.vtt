00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:01.400
Mr. Xiao

2
00:00:01.466 --> 00:00:04.233
I have expelled Sun Tzu Feng, a rebel, from my house

3
00:00:04.766 --> 00:00:07.100
Mr. Shaw, if your anger has not subsided

4
00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:08.500
You can do whatever you want with me.

5
00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:09.600
I have no complaints

6
00:00:09.766 --> 00:00:10.900
Just please

7
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.300
Let go of the Sun family and don't take it

8
00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:16.833
I didn't expect you to be so ruthless

9
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:18.200
So be it.

10
00:00:18.766 --> 00:00:20.033
That being the case

11
00:00:20.366 --> 00:00:21.833
Just let your Sun family mother go

12
00:00:22.266 --> 00:00:24.600
But the United Chamber of Commerce

13
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.700
You can't run it anymore.

14
00:00:26.966 --> 00:00:28.366
Thank you for killing

15
00:00:28.366 --> 00:00:30.266
Little sir, I'll go home and settle

16
00:00:30.266 --> 00:00:31.166
Within a week

17
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.400
I promise the United Chamber of Commerce will close soon

18
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:35.600
Go down

19
00:00:40.166 --> 00:00:42.433
His subordinate Guo Qing paid homage to Wuji Architecture

20
00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.466
You figured it out.

21
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.033
Get up.

22
00:00:48.066 --> 00:00:49.866
The only supreme black card in the world

23
00:00:49.866 --> 00:00:51.100
Only the owner has it.

24
00:00:51.133 --> 00:00:52.933
Plus Sun Chenglong's attitude just now

25
00:00:52.933 --> 00:00:54.166
Such obvious evidence

26
00:00:54.166 --> 00:00:55.800
I still can't guess your identity.

27
00:00:56.066 --> 00:00:57.200
Then I don't deserve it either.

28
00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:58.766
As the agent of Beihai Invincible Store

29
00:00:58.766 --> 00:01:00.000
Invincible Store Beihai City

30
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.166
To someone as talented and intelligent as you

31
00:01:02.333 --> 00:01:03.300
I'm relieved.

32
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.300
Thank you for the compliment.

33
00:01:04.666 --> 00:01:06.766
You have to go through fire and water

34
00:01:06.766 --> 00:01:08.033
No one told you to die

35
00:01:08.066 --> 00:01:10.100
But there is one thing you need to do

36
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.900
Dare to ask the owner what's the matter

37
00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:13.700
buy

38
00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:16.066
Betrothal gift
