00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:01.500
Hahahaha

2
00:00:01.733 --> 00:00:03.966
This is going to be a family soon

3
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.366
This resource

4
00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:07.666
It should be shared.

5
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:09.700
It's not negotiable.

6
00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:12.500
This Promise Hall is my life's work

7
00:00:13.066 --> 00:00:14.700
The person who can hand it over

8
00:00:15.966 --> 00:00:17.300
It's not negotiable.

9
00:00:17.866 --> 00:00:18.600
Humph

10
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.966
I said that Xiao Wuji was not sincere towards Mu Yan, right?

11
00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:24.700
I can't even bear to part with the Promise Palace

12
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.966
How can Mu Yan be happy if she marries Mu Yan?

13
00:00:28.966 --> 00:00:31.100
To see if a man truly loves you

14
00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:32.533
Not listen to what he has to say

15
00:00:32.533 --> 00:00:34.266
It was about what he did.

16
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.033
He dares to blatantly reject your father before he is married

17
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.333
What if you were married?

18
00:00:39.333 --> 00:00:41.433
He doesn't have the final say in this Zhao family

19
00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.700
Wei Yan, listen to me

20
00:00:44.333 --> 00:00:45.866
I hope you can understand me.

21
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.900
I can give you everything in the world

22
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.200
But only indefinite electricity cannot

23
00:00:52.866 --> 00:00:54.300
Otherwise, a hundred years from now

24
00:00:55.133 --> 00:00:56.900
I will have no face to face my adoptive father

25
00:00:57.766 --> 00:01:00.000
For the dead soldiers of the Wuji Temple

26
00:01:00.133 --> 00:01:02.166
I thought you really loved me

27
00:01:02.566 --> 00:01:04.266
Would do anything for me

28
00:01:04.733 --> 00:01:06.200
But I didn't expect

29
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.000
You can't even bear to part with the Promise Palace

30
00:01:10.966 --> 00:01:12.666
I was so blind

31
00:01:13.066 --> 00:01:15.366
Fancy you selfish person

32
00:01:15.466 --> 00:01:17.066
Let me ask you something.

33
00:01:17.366 --> 00:01:18.800
Weapon Shop and Me

34
00:01:19.733 --> 00:01:21.100
Which one do you choose?

35
00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.700
Sorry I thought I was done

36
00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.100
Don't say another word.

37
00:01:26.366 --> 00:01:27.600
That being the case

38
00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:31.900
It's okay if you don't get married.

39
00:01:36.266 --> 00:01:37.600
This is what you said.

40
00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:40.766
Don't you regret it

41
00:01:42.166 --> 00:01:42.966
English

42
00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:46.466
Will you marry me?

43
00:01:46.466 --> 00:01:48.000
Ah, brother Wuji

44
00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:49.800
If you want

45
00:01:50.533 --> 00:01:52.066
We're getting married soon.

46
00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.000
I swear I will live up to it

47
00:01:56.066 --> 00:01:57.066
And you know what?

48
00:01:57.066 --> 00:01:59.400
I've been waiting for your words for a long time

49
00:02:04.166 --> 00:02:04.966
Xiao Wuji

50
00:02:05.733 --> 00:02:07.000
You bastard

51
00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:09.800
You didn't choose it.

52
00:02:13.766 --> 00:02:15.233
Hey, hey, hey.

53
00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.400
What I said is good

54
00:02:17.566 --> 00:02:19.766
I can't teach people whether to be righteous or not

55
00:02:19.766 --> 00:02:21.900
But you can't afford to laugh in front of you

56
00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.066
Chose the former

57
00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:24.700
Give up resistance

58
00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.866
Give your body to the herb

59
00:02:26.866 --> 00:02:28.366
Materia Medica can destroy the first one

60
00:02:28.366 --> 00:02:29.700
You heartless man

61
00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.433
You get justice
