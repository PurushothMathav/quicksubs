00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.466
Hey, I really can't identify it.

2
00:00:03.333 --> 00:00:05.166
I saw you so imposing just now

3
00:00:05.166 --> 00:00:06.933
I almost believed what you said

4
00:00:06.933 --> 00:00:11.466
I didn't expect it, hahaha, I'm really dying of laughter.

5
00:00:11.466 --> 00:00:14.466
Xiao Wuji, please lie and place an order

6
00:00:14.466 --> 00:00:16.000
Can I just buy a real card?

7
00:00:16.266 --> 00:00:17.833
Even if there is no money in it

8
00:00:18.066 --> 00:00:21.166
It's better than this unrecognizable fake card, right?

9
00:00:21.166 --> 00:00:23.800
Miss, your POS machine should be malfunctioning.

10
00:00:23.933 --> 00:00:25.033
Check it out.

11
00:00:25.733 --> 00:00:26.600
look down on

12
00:00:26.733 --> 00:00:29.666
Why don't you say the global network is down?

13
00:00:29.666 --> 00:00:32.266
I see, don't hold on

14
00:00:32.266 --> 00:00:33.900
If you really can't settle the account

15
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.566
Stay and wash the dishes

16
00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:36.833
You need to know

17
00:00:36.866 --> 00:00:39.666
Not everyone can live here in Genting Immortal

18
00:00:39.666 --> 00:00:40.800
Martial arts is very important

19
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.066
You're a blessing in disguise, sorry sir

20
00:00:44.066 --> 00:00:46.200
We don't support it here for enemy photos.

21
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.500
Please pay ASAP.

22
00:00:47.533 --> 00:00:49.633
Otherwise I'll have to call security

23
00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:51.200
How come?

24
00:00:52.666 --> 00:00:54.000
Who made you make a fuss here?

25
00:00:54.066 --> 00:00:56.366
Can you afford it if you get other guests?

26
00:00:56.366 --> 00:00:58.466
Manager, there is a customer who wants to pay the bill.

27
00:00:58.466 --> 00:01:01.200
But his card is not recognized and will not be replaced

28
00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.500
I just shut up

29
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:05.766
Blind your dog eyes

30
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.566
This card is the only Supreme Black in the world

31
00:01:08.766 --> 00:01:11.066
It must be your machine that is broken, so hurry up and roll down.

32
00:01:11.066 --> 00:01:12.566
And it gets worse.

33
00:01:15.066 --> 00:01:17.566
Sir, due to our work mistakes

34
00:01:17.666 --> 00:01:19.200
The unpleasantness of your meal

35
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.266
I apologize here for 12 points.

36
00:01:21.266 --> 00:01:22.233
Please forgive me.
