1
00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:01.600
let go

2
00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:04.666
Sun Tzu Peak relies on your support

3
00:00:04.733 --> 00:00:06.000
Not only urumu

4
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:07.966
And make things difficult for me

5
00:00:08.166 --> 00:00:09.200
And finally.

6
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.200
They even threatened me not to leave this hotel

7
00:00:12.666 --> 00:00:14.966
Humph so nonsense

8
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:16.966
How can I let Mr. Shaw go?

9
00:00:16.966 --> 00:00:17.900
Oh, I see.

10
00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:18.966
You are an animal

11
00:00:19.366 --> 00:00:20.566
I now declare

12
00:00:20.566 --> 00:00:21.666
From today onwards

13
00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:24.066
Expel Sun Tzu Feng from the family

14
00:00:25.466 --> 00:00:28.566
In the future, no matter whether you live or die, it has nothing to do with the Sun family

15
00:00:28.566 --> 00:00:30.233
There will be no self-service in the future.

16
00:00:30.266 --> 00:00:31.966
Dad, what are you talking about?

17
00:00:31.966 --> 00:00:33.333
I am your own son

18
00:00:33.333 --> 00:00:34.700
You can't do that!

19
00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:35.633
You bastard

20
00:00:36.266 --> 00:00:38.000
It's all your fault

21
00:00:38.866 --> 00:00:40.233
Can't blame my father

22
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.400
For our Sun family

23
00:00:42.466 --> 00:00:43.500
For your mother

24
00:00:43.533 --> 00:00:45.366
For your sister and brother

25
00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.000
I can only abandon you now

26
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.966
Dad, you can't do this. Go away

27
00:00:53.133 --> 00:00:54.266
What? Where are you going?

28
00:00:54.266 --> 00:00:55.400
Don't you want me too?

29
00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:56.666
Don't pull me

30
00:00:56.733 --> 00:00:58.766
You have now been expelled from your home by the Sun family

31
00:00:58.766 --> 00:01:00.533
What makes you think I'll still be with you?

32
00:01:00.533 --> 00:01:02.033
Do you suffer with you?

33
00:01:02.166 --> 00:01:03.100
Get out of here

34
00:01:03.666 --> 00:01:05.866
Su Chen, Su Chen, don't go

35
00:01:05.866 --> 00:01:06.666
Come on.

36
00:01:07.133 --> 00:01:09.166
Someone owes you something to bring home

37
00:01:09.166 --> 00:01:10.866
Tell him to pack up and get out

38
00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:11.766
Oh dad

39
00:01:11.766 --> 00:01:12.766
You can't do this to me!

40
00:01:12.766 --> 00:01:13.800
Go away dad

41
00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.433
You can't do this to me!
