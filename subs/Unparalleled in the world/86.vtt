1
00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:03.000
It's impossible for a guy like Xiao Wuji

2
00:00:03.133 --> 00:00:04.900
How could there be such a value as Wushuang Craft Brewing?

3
00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:05.966
Liancheng's peerless wine

4
00:00:05.966 --> 00:00:08.066
Brother Gu, what do you mean?

5
00:00:08.266 --> 00:00:10.666
Xiao Wuji's unparalleled aging is real

6
00:00:10.933 --> 00:00:12.233
Then your wine

7
00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:13.433
Tell the truth

8
00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:16.066
Is my wine fake?

9
00:00:16.366 --> 00:00:18.433
You are the agent of Wuji in Beihai

10
00:00:18.466 --> 00:00:19.400
high weight

11
00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:20.333
Why lie to us?

12
00:00:20.333 --> 00:00:21.700
I am not a friendship cheat

13
00:00:22.066 --> 00:00:24.200
I think I haven't seen you in years

14
00:00:24.366 --> 00:00:25.266
I thought

15
00:00:25.266 --> 00:00:27.333
With unparalleled aging that others can't buy at all

16
00:00:27.333 --> 00:00:30.000
To enhance our friendship with each other

17
00:00:30.066 --> 00:00:32.066
However, matchless aging yields are extremely low

18
00:00:32.766 --> 00:00:35.066
Even ordinary Dharma Protectors are hard to drink

19
00:00:35.333 --> 00:00:37.033
So I suspect confusion.

20
00:00:37.333 --> 00:00:38.566
Take such measures

21
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.300
I beg your pardon.

22
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.366
Brother Gu is serious

23
00:00:42.366 --> 00:00:44.066
You did it out of kindness

24
00:00:44.066 --> 00:00:45.166
Again

25
00:00:45.333 --> 00:00:47.600
Since what you brought here is not Peerless Aging

26
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.433
But also top-notch beauty

27
00:00:49.933 --> 00:00:52.100
Are we physical to blame again?

28
00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.100
That is, everyone is not an outsider

29
00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:55.266
Don't be so polite.

30
00:00:55.366 --> 00:00:57.100
Since everyone is so upbeat

31
00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.866
Then we won't bring it up again.

32
00:00:59.266 --> 00:01:01.500
And then I made a public apology.

33
00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:02.433
But little man

34
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.200
I want to ask

35
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:07.233
Where did your bottle of truly unparalleled aging come from?

36
00:01:08.133 --> 00:01:09.300
Taken from home

37
00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.266
Do you think this is soy sauce?

38
00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.200
Take it directly from home

39
00:01:13.266 --> 00:01:17.166
Junior high school said that the output of this unparalleled aging is particularly rare

40
00:01:17.166 --> 00:01:18.900
How could you have it at home?
