00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.766
Waiter pays

2
00:00:02.133 --> 00:00:03.100
Hello, sir.

3
00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:05.133
Thank you for dining at our Genting Xianzhu

4
00:00:05.133 --> 00:00:06.466
Here's your bill for the barbecue

5
00:00:07.133 --> 00:00:08.200
Hey wait

6
00:00:10.066 --> 00:00:12.400
Why haven't I seen the pattern of this card?

7
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:13.400
This is a black chicken restaurant.

8
00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.233
Exclusive cards issued to agents around the world

9
00:00:15.466 --> 00:00:17.166
One page at a time, take it at will

10
00:00:17.166 --> 00:00:19.100
As expected of the power all over the world

11
00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:21.233
One billion per agent

12
00:00:21.333 --> 00:00:23.433
How much does that add up to?

13
00:00:23.533 --> 00:00:25.466
It is indeed the largest organization in the world

14
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:26.600
After this incident

15
00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.866
You can see the strength

16
00:00:28.866 --> 00:00:30.800
But you don't need to invite today.

17
00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:36.233
What time in the afternoon did you not say that your status is noble?

18
00:00:36.366 --> 00:00:39.200
Even this unparalleled aging wine has a dark fragrance?

19
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.633
Can you treat us to a meal? No problem?

20
00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.866
Since we haven't seen each other for a long time

21
00:00:45.866 --> 00:00:47.400
This meal is on me

22
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.866
Just treat it as a pick-up for Gu Qing. Gu Yuan, don't move.

23
00:00:51.466 --> 00:00:52.966
I'm asking Xiao Wuji to please

24
00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.966
Why won't you be with Mu Yan after

25
00:00:57.066 --> 00:00:58.766
You don't bring money when you go out, right?

26
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:00.966
A meal?

27
00:01:01.133 --> 00:01:02.666
Of course I can afford it.

28
00:01:06.166 --> 00:01:07.866
Don't be a fake card

29
00:01:07.866 --> 00:01:09.766
I have to check it out

30
00:01:09.766 --> 00:01:12.866
Otherwise, wait a minute, there will be more than one shame
