00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:04.066
Hmph, in front of whom do I dare not make a big judgment speech?

2
00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:06.300
Dad, why are you here?

3
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:07.933
Hmm, I happened to pass by

4
00:00:07.933 --> 00:00:10.000
I came in when I heard someone calling me.

5
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.266
I'd like to see it

6
00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:13.166
Which bastard is it?

7
00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:16.033
How dare you say nonsense here?

8
00:00:16.533 --> 00:00:18.000
It's him, you little punk

9
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.000
arrogant and domineering

10
00:00:19.066 --> 00:00:20.966
Just because of a few jokes

11
00:00:20.966 --> 00:00:22.000
He hit Susan.

12
00:00:22.166 --> 00:00:25.400
And he also threatened not to take my Sun family seriously

13
00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.366
Even if his parents come, they have to give him handrails

14
00:00:28.366 --> 00:00:29.600
What a burden

15
00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:31.500
After the fall of the royal family

16
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.066
United Group is already the third largest in the North Sea

17
00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.266
You haven't grown a single hair.

18
00:00:36.266 --> 00:00:37.900
How dare you insult Chairperson Sun?

19
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.566
Hmph, don't you want to live?

20
00:00:40.566 --> 00:00:44.033
Haha, no one is venting the fire.

21
00:00:44.133 --> 00:00:45.066
kid

22
00:00:45.166 --> 00:00:48.166
It seems that I will not forgive you easily today

23
00:00:48.466 --> 00:00:49.166
brat

24
00:00:49.166 --> 00:00:51.566
Turn around and let me see who you are

25
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.900
Dare to run amok here

26
00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:56.300
Turn around and lack your little braids?

27
00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:57.333
How dare you offend Mr. Sun?

28
00:00:57.333 --> 00:00:59.700
Do you know what's going to happen?

29
00:01:01.066 --> 00:01:02.000
Take my life

30
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.766
Mr. Shaw

31
00:01:04.133 --> 00:01:05.500
Why are you here?

32
00:01:05.566 --> 00:01:06.800
Chairperson Sun

33
00:01:07.066 --> 00:01:08.300
No see for a few days

34
00:01:08.466 --> 00:01:09.966
Is it a big increase?

35
00:01:09.966 --> 00:01:12.366
It seems that Qiao Zixi, this girl, can't let you grow up

36
00:01:12.366 --> 00:01:13.166
Memory

37
00:01:13.566 --> 00:01:14.800
In that case

38
00:01:14.866 --> 00:01:17.966
The Li family and the Wang family are just like you

39
00:01:18.066 --> 00:01:20.266
Little sir, I really didn't know you were here.

40
00:01:20.266 --> 00:01:21.233
I need to know

41
00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.100
I dare not be offended in the slightest.

42
00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.200
Little sir, little director, myself?
