00:00:02.566 --> 00:00:03.366
wait

2
00:00:03.766 --> 00:00:05.133
Y'all stop arguing

3
00:00:05.133 --> 00:00:06.500
Grandma was woken up by you

4
00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:08.100
Be careful grandma gets sicker

5
00:00:08.733 --> 00:00:11.366
Wuji, you are really back

6
00:00:11.733 --> 00:00:12.666
Sorry grandma

7
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.300
Wuji made you sick

8
00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:15.900
It has nothing to do with you.

9
00:00:15.966 --> 00:00:18.400
As you get older, you get sicker.

10
00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:19.733
Just do it.

11
00:00:19.733 --> 00:00:21.700
You all do it.

12
00:00:24.933 --> 00:00:27.466
God, it's our baby

13
00:00:27.466 --> 00:00:29.500
Wherever you go, there are seats

14
00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.633
There's nothing you can do. You can only stand.

15
00:00:33.066 --> 00:00:35.166
That's the difference.

16
00:00:35.166 --> 00:00:38.266
Some people are so low that they are not even as good as a dog

17
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.733
You still want to marry Mu Yan?

18
00:00:40.733 --> 00:00:42.400
Stop daydreaming!

19
00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.400
Get up, not who do you think you are?

20
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.200
How dare you let me take the seat?

21
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.800
Dogs don't deserve to sit with people

22
00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.900
I haven't calculated the account of Sister Xiao Wu yesterday with you yet.

23
00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:59.633
How dare you throw me on the ground?

24
00:00:59.733 --> 00:01:01.866
What kind of decency does it make to be noisy?

25
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.166
No hurry, just sit there

26
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.433
Thank you, Grandma.

27
00:01:06.766 --> 00:01:08.700
Yes grandma

28
00:01:09.766 --> 00:01:11.700
Wu Qi knows you like jade.

29
00:01:12.166 --> 00:01:14.833
I specially prepared a bracelet made of Kunlun ancient jade for you.

30
00:01:15.733 --> 00:01:16.866
Wu Qi puts it on for you

31
00:01:17.266 --> 00:01:18.633
It can prolong life.

32
00:01:19.333 --> 00:01:21.266
What Kunlun ancient jade is this?

33
00:01:21.266 --> 00:01:23.800
It looks better to cover the enemy than to stall goods

34
00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:25.333
This crap

35
00:01:25.333 --> 00:01:27.900
It's not too embarrassing to take it out

36
00:01:29.066 --> 00:01:31.633
It's a scumbag like Xiao Wuji

37
00:01:31.766 --> 00:01:33.300
How can there be such a good thing?

38
00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:35.600
I think it's just random junk

39
00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:36.800
To fool grandma

40
00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.066
Blind things like you

41
00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:40.766
How can I find this problem?

42
00:01:40.766 --> 00:01:44.466
Xiao Wuji, you are not afraid to talk big and flash your tongue

43
00:01:44.766 --> 00:01:45.566
OK

44
00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:49.100
I'll see what kind of baby this is today.
