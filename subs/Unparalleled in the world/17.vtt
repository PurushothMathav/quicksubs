00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:00.800
Let me tell you something.

2
00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:02.866
I'm going to give you all your accounts today

3
00:00:02.866 --> 00:00:03.766
I'll figure it out for you.

4
00:00:03.766 --> 00:00:06.366
Humph, this negativity is really bold

5
00:00:06.366 --> 00:00:07.933
Lian is in charge of the underground move of the North Sea

6
00:00:07.933 --> 00:00:09.966
More than 30 years of imprisonment dare to provoke you

7
00:00:09.966 --> 00:00:11.866
Okay, save me the trouble

8
00:00:11.933 --> 00:00:12.733
bold

9
00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:13.900
Mr. Xiao

10
00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:16.800
Minghui is also a trash like you who can call it directly

11
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:17.666
Xiao Wuji

12
00:00:17.933 --> 00:00:20.800
I didn't expect you to be quite capable, you little trash

13
00:00:21.166 --> 00:00:23.233
Looking for such a beautiful woman as a backer

14
00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:25.800
What's so good about Xiao Wuji?

15
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.000
A poor turtle disaster

16
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.033
You follow your brother to promise

17
00:00:29.733 --> 00:00:31.800
Ah, you know I'm here

18
00:00:33.566 --> 00:00:35.066
Hmm step aside

19
00:00:35.333 --> 00:00:37.500
You are Qiao Zixi

20
00:00:37.866 --> 00:00:40.400
Well, now that you know who I am

21
00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.600
Just get out of here with your people

22
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:46.233
I'm so scared, don't think there is a Wuji Temple as a demon

23
00:00:46.466 --> 00:00:49.100
You can yell in front of me

24
00:00:50.166 --> 00:00:53.066
Although the Fifth Street Store is now said to be the number one in the world

25
00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.166
And you

26
00:00:54.533 --> 00:00:57.633
It's just an elf belonging to the next small division

27
00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:00.233
Are you sure about that?

28
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.633
For a little white

29
00:01:02.066 --> 00:01:04.900
If this North Sea Underground King is the enemy?

30
00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:06.300
Beihai Dragon King

31
00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:08.800
Not even worthy of lifting my shoes

32
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.266
Yo boy

33
00:01:10.866 --> 00:01:14.300
Yes, no one dares to talk to me like that for 20 years

34
00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:18.500
Okay, I need you to know the sky in the Northeast Sea today.

35
00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:20.033
What would be the effect?

36
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.500
If you were the sky of the North Sea

37
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.433
Then I will today

38
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.400
Just pierce it
