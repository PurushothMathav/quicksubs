00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.233
Why hasn't this bridge come back yet?

2
00:00:07.366 --> 00:00:09.700
This kid is so sad

3
00:00:09.866 --> 00:00:11.833
The boat drove to a unicorn bone.

4
00:00:11.933 --> 00:00:14.833
I don't know how many evil years are thinking of him

5
00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.966
Old lunatic, what are your hobbies?

6
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.566
I'm helping you.

7
00:00:22.566 --> 00:00:26.133
Get out of here, come closer to me and call someone, oh you

8
00:00:26.133 --> 00:00:27.766
Ghosts are on

9
00:00:27.766 --> 00:00:30.600
I'm taking off your pants to help you

10
00:00:30.733 --> 00:00:33.466
It's a ghost, you old crazy old pervert

11
00:00:33.466 --> 00:00:34.366
I'm going to call someone

12
00:00:34.366 --> 00:00:38.433
What's the use of calling someone like an old lunatic?

13
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.900
Just let me dig his heart out

14
00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.300
I've already quenched my thirst

15
00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.100
It must be the double of Emotional Comfort.

16
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.366
The blood is gone

17
00:00:48.366 --> 00:00:49.833
What kind of blood?

18
00:00:49.866 --> 00:00:52.400
I told you you were a zombie

19
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.100
I don't care.

20
00:00:54.133 --> 00:00:55.533
Bye

21
00:00:55.533 --> 00:00:56.700
Master of wind and rain

22
00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:57.400
You mustn't go

23
00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:58.900
I was wrong, grandson.

24
00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:00.300
Are you going or not?

25
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:03.600
Oh wait a minute

26
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:04.600
I'm leaving right now

27
00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.166
Immediately, the chest muscles will explode

28
00:01:06.166 --> 00:01:08.400
What about a man's mouth fooling a ghost?

29
00:01:08.666 --> 00:01:10.233
It's almost dawn.

30
00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:11.700
You're okay?

31
00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.266
But the relationship is miserable
