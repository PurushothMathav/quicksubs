00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:00.600
Why is that?

2
00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:01.600
This is my grandfather.

3
00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:04.300
Sorry, the forensic doctor needs to do a DNA comparison first

4
00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:05.766
Then handle it as a case

5
00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:08.900
After the case is saved, it will be returned to the family for disposal.

6
00:00:09.133 --> 00:00:11.166
How can I get it quickly?

7
00:00:11.366 --> 00:00:13.600
It will be a month at the soonest.

8
00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:14.700
I'm curious.

9
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:15.966
Why are you in such a hurry to get it?

10
00:00:15.966 --> 00:00:17.000
Your grandfather's will

11
00:00:17.333 --> 00:00:18.700
I don't understand you.

12
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.200
Sorry, we'll go back and wait for the notice.

13
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:22.566
Just left

14
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.233
Find another way

15
00:00:24.366 --> 00:00:25.366
This plan is scrapped

16
00:00:25.366 --> 00:00:26.533
It's getting dark

17
00:00:26.533 --> 00:00:28.500
Let's go back and listen. People will read.

18
00:00:28.566 --> 00:00:30.666
The master will teach us how to join the ranks of the undead

19
00:00:37.166 --> 00:00:39.233
Seems to have come back in vain

20
00:00:39.366 --> 00:00:40.333
My grandfather's remains

21
00:00:40.333 --> 00:00:42.066
I don't even have the right to look at it.

22
00:00:42.066 --> 00:00:43.100
Stop complaining

23
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.266
It won't be long.

24
00:00:44.266 --> 00:00:45.200
Wait for them to come

25
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.733
I'll open the altar and make sure you run for the car

26
00:00:47.733 --> 00:00:49.466
I had to drive from the middle.

27
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:50.566
You wait along the road

28
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.233
I will also try it first

29
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.766
You have to be careful!

30
00:00:55.866 --> 00:00:57.600
It's okay, there are many of us.

31
00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:59.733
Anyway, Wang Lin has been won over by us

32
00:00:59.733 --> 00:01:02.166
It's better for us to have a bigger identity

33
00:01:02.166 --> 00:01:03.266
You're leaving now

34
00:01:03.266 --> 00:01:04.500
Don't miss the market by mistake
