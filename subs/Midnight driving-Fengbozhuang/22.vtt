00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:04.233
You in Xinjiang in a while

2
00:00:04.666 --> 00:00:06.766
Gotta hold him steady

3
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.000
Zhou Jianzhong dared not say

4
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.866
Be sure to open a breakthrough in him

5
00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:13.900
Steady hehe

6
00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:15.433
Hold him steady

7
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:18.833
Hey, don't worry.

8
00:00:19.066 --> 00:00:21.966
Pretenders like you are open to money

9
00:00:22.166 --> 00:00:24.400
Hold on, my name is Liu

10
00:00:24.466 --> 00:00:26.466
Isn't it the person who sees money?

11
00:00:27.333 --> 00:00:29.300
You are quite noble

12
00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.833
Your lord, Li Mingjia has nothing to do with me

13
00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.833
How much does he owe you to let him go has nothing to do with you

14
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.633
You pay Li Mingjia back the money

15
00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:39.100
I have to find you today

16
00:00:40.333 --> 00:00:42.600
I have no money, don't get me wrong

17
00:00:42.666 --> 00:00:44.600
I'm not here to ask you for money today.

18
00:00:45.966 --> 00:00:47.566
I'm here to give you money.

19
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.766
Uncle, don't joke

20
00:00:51.966 --> 00:00:53.600
You pay back the money for Li Ning's family

21
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.300
The first payment becomes RMB

22
00:00:55.333 --> 00:00:57.366
You gave me a second one, didn't you?

23
00:00:57.866 --> 00:01:00.266
Yeah I didn't leave a penny

24
00:01:00.266 --> 00:01:01.400
So here's the first one.

25
00:01:02.366 --> 00:01:03.466
Real Money

26
00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.400
Didn't you throw it away?

27
00:01:06.466 --> 00:01:08.200
These guys think I'm dazzled

28
00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.166
Pick it up for me again

29
00:01:09.166 --> 00:01:10.833
Come back oye

30
00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:12.166
eldest sister

31
00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:14.866
In fact, I don't know if you keep it.

32
00:01:16.333 --> 00:01:17.466
You are good

33
00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.066
I have something to talk about in the future

34
00:01:20.733 --> 00:01:22.300
Did you call me yourself?

35
00:01:22.333 --> 00:01:24.666
What the hell are you two doing?
