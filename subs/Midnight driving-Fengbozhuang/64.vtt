1
00:00:03.333 --> 00:00:04.300
Why haven't you come yet?

2
00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:05.566
They had a busy night.

3
00:00:05.566 --> 00:00:07.266
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

4
00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:10.233
Master Geng Cheng

5
00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.700
We visited according to the list given by Zhou Jianfeng

6
00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:13.766
It's all clear

7
00:00:13.766 --> 00:00:15.566
We have fought for everything we should fight for

8
00:00:15.566 --> 00:00:16.666
I'm confused

9
00:00:16.666 --> 00:00:17.600
How?

10
00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.166
Is there anything else I don't know about?

11
00:00:19.166 --> 00:00:22.100
Do you remember Bello's fat wife?

12
00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:24.000
The reason why he doesn't want to leave

13
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.100
Just thinking about the bedridden husband at home

14
00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:29.066
And immature children

15
00:00:29.066 --> 00:00:30.866
I'll let Wei Die go.

16
00:00:30.933 --> 00:00:33.200
Arrange their family's food and clothing expenses

17
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.000
Solved their worries

18
00:00:35.166 --> 00:00:37.666
Now he has also given up his career

19
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.300
And the old man in charge

20
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.600
But the famous old nail

21
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.566
I've been employed all my life just looking for a partner to talk to

22
00:00:43.566 --> 00:00:45.333
We found his first love

23
00:00:45.333 --> 00:00:46.266
Also alone

24
00:00:46.266 --> 00:00:47.533
I convinced his children

25
00:00:47.533 --> 00:00:49.000
Let the two be buried together

26
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.166
Let them be companions

27
00:00:50.166 --> 00:00:51.700
Don't you collect debts for a living?

28
00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:55.000
When did you become a negotiator and a full-time matchmaker?

29
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.600
Do you have any super powers?

30
00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.866
There is a door that cannot be opened wherever the super power money is opened

31
00:00:59.866 --> 00:01:02.066
We have tried our best to compensate for all the ghosts.

32
00:01:02.066 --> 00:01:04.366
Do your best to make sure they don't help the old ones

33
00:01:04.366 --> 00:01:05.666
Do you have one?

34
00:01:05.666 --> 00:01:07.033
They don't look like philanthropists.

35
00:01:07.166 --> 00:01:08.566
Master, can't it be you?

36
00:01:08.566 --> 00:01:11.733
Hidden deep enough hahaha I'm penniless

37
00:01:11.733 --> 00:01:13.500
I don't even know where breakfast is

38
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.100
Where did the charity come from?

39
00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.866
Look why it's not me, we have a big boss behind us

40
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:19.833
Big boss

41
00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:24.600
I'm not late, am I?
