00:00:02.933 --> 00:00:05.266
Zheng Cheng, you Tibetan heart, you want to kill me

2
00:00:05.266 --> 00:00:06.866
Don't rush the uncle if you don't have money.

3
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:10.366
Ah you pay

4
00:00:11.933 --> 00:00:13.266
I gave you real money

5
00:00:13.266 --> 00:00:14.133
Don't play tricks

6
00:00:14.133 --> 00:00:15.800
This is what you give.

7
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.966
If I play tricks for your money

8
00:00:17.966 --> 00:00:19.500
I am your grandson

9
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:22.266
That's impossible.

10
00:00:22.466 --> 00:00:24.600
This is my driver's license

11
00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:26.333
They all say that heaven and earth are evil

12
00:00:26.333 --> 00:00:28.066
I didn't believe it before

13
00:00:28.166 --> 00:00:30.600
Today's retribution came to Lao Tzu's head

14
00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:34.700
I see.

15
00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.200
I just had no money to pay the rent

16
00:00:37.666 --> 00:00:38.766
And 40,000

17
00:00:39.866 --> 00:00:41.066
Take a look.

18
00:00:41.366 --> 00:00:43.033
Is that true?

19
00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:45.266
Look at your dirty hands

20
00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:48.500
Bad tax old lunatic, don't play tricks

21
00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.866
See, this is real money.

22
00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.300
The second and third let them go

23
00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.200
The surname Li remembers the day when the money is returned next time.

24
00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.233
Everyone is going to die, what's the matter?
