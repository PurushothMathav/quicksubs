00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:03.800
Are you okay? Why do you feel bad?

2
00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:05.900
I'm afraid you'll die before it's done

3
00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:07.200
What did you just take?

4
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.966
How did you drive Wong Tai Sin away?

5
00:00:10.266 --> 00:00:11.300
This is a unicorn bone.

6
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.433
My family heirloom amulet

7
00:00:13.466 --> 00:00:14.566
Can't leave

8
00:00:14.566 --> 00:00:16.966
Stingy, can't even I see it?

9
00:00:19.866 --> 00:00:21.066
Then I'll give it to you.

10
00:00:21.066 --> 00:00:21.966
Just kidding.

11
00:00:21.966 --> 00:00:23.700
Since it's a family heirloom, put it away

12
00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:24.700
Let's keep looking

13
00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:26.133
Since Wong Tai Sin can come here

14
00:00:26.133 --> 00:00:27.900
That means there must be a clue here

15
00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:29.866
What did Zhou Jianzhou say?

16
00:00:29.866 --> 00:00:31.400
The plot of meeting your grandfather

17
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:34.100
He said my grandpa was sitting behind him

18
00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:35.800
Hands around his neck

19
00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.366
Yeah, that's what it says.

20
00:00:43.333 --> 00:00:46.066
I found it. It's air-dried. Is it still usable?

21
00:00:50.066 --> 00:00:51.400
It's too dry to smell

22
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.233
Soak in water and don't know if it can recover.

23
00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:54.833
Let's go back

24
00:00:58.300 --> 00:00:59.666
Let's see what this is.

25
00:01:01.466 --> 00:01:02.966
What plants do you know?

26
00:01:02.966 --> 00:01:03.700
We can put the shoes

27
00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.666
The whitest corpse has been salvaged

28
00:01:05.666 --> 00:01:06.966
This will reduce his power

29
00:01:07.466 --> 00:01:08.966
It can also defuse his strength

30
00:01:09.066 --> 00:01:10.066
Quell the Catastrophe

31
00:01:10.133 --> 00:01:10.966
Master Wu

32
00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:14.500
Your old man has been knowledgeable about subjecting demons and removing demons all his life

33
00:01:14.766 --> 00:01:15.566
Take a look.

34
00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:17.600
ashamed

35
00:01:17.666 --> 00:01:19.966
I don't know anything about Dongpo

36
00:01:20.333 --> 00:01:21.466
No matter what

37
00:01:21.733 --> 00:01:23.533
I broke my leg outside.

38
00:01:23.533 --> 00:01:25.166
You guys are pretty free

39
00:01:25.166 --> 00:01:26.233
I quit
