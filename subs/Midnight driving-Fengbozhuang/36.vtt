00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:01.266
Zhou Jiancong

2
00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.066
Don't be too selfish.

3
00:00:04.466 --> 00:00:06.333
You don't tell the truth

4
00:00:06.333 --> 00:00:09.000
How can we find a solution?

5
00:00:11.366 --> 00:00:12.600
Still won't say it?

6
00:00:12.733 --> 00:00:14.366
Is the injury too serious?

7
00:00:14.366 --> 00:00:16.200
He's okay.

8
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.000
Just a hob meat

9
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.200
Is there any other way?

10
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.633
No time to spend with him

11
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:23.066
There are such people in the world

12
00:00:23.166 --> 00:00:25.033
Judgment is not self-serving

13
00:00:25.066 --> 00:00:28.033
If it weren't for the hundreds of months involved

14
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:29.966
I don't care about him.

15
00:00:29.966 --> 00:00:30.766
master

16
00:00:31.266 --> 00:00:33.666
Do you have a way to give him some means?

17
00:00:33.966 --> 00:00:35.166
Just write it down

18
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.900
My master told me when I was practicing

19
00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:40.466
How do you get those bystanders?

20
00:00:40.466 --> 00:00:42.466
I never practice that stuff.

21
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:43.866
I'm good at this

22
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.600
Leave it to me, even if it's dead

23
00:00:46.666 --> 00:00:48.333
I also have a way to get him to talk

24
00:00:48.333 --> 00:00:50.066
If you accidentally kill him

25
00:00:50.066 --> 00:00:50.966
Not only can't save people

26
00:00:50.966 --> 00:00:52.166
I have to eat a coffin

27
00:00:52.166 --> 00:00:52.966
No way.

28
00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.333
Your method is useless in Zhou Jiancheng Murakami

29
00:00:56.333 --> 00:00:58.800
I show that I don't want a tooth for a tooth.

30
00:00:59.666 --> 00:01:01.766
Did you hear the surnamed Zhou?

31
00:01:01.966 --> 00:01:03.633
Anything with a human touch

32
00:01:03.766 --> 00:01:05.866
Just say yes.

33
00:01:05.866 --> 00:01:09.000
Master Wei, please bring Jiang Xiaomi back
