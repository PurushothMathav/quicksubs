00:00:01.466 --> 00:00:04.200
How dare you play with me

2
00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.966
I played you, why did your wife play me?

3
00:00:07.966 --> 00:00:09.033
How can I play with you?

4
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:11.400
Let all the hard-to-pick people play

5
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:12.600
How did you drop one?

6
00:00:12.766 --> 00:00:13.766
Seven days later

7
00:00:14.066 --> 00:00:15.066
You go a little further

8
00:00:15.666 --> 00:00:16.500
otherwise

9
00:00:17.466 --> 00:00:18.600
Lonely to die

10
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.200
Impossible. Everyone got on the bus.

11
00:00:26.766 --> 00:00:29.466
What did you hit? I turned your business over.

12
00:00:29.466 --> 00:00:30.633
No parking allowed

13
00:00:31.866 --> 00:00:33.033
It seems last night

14
00:00:33.966 --> 00:00:35.066
Hit someone

15
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.566
I'm not sure either.

16
00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:39.666
You let me shout

17
00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.266
When I call

18
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.900
I seem to have seen this shoe somewhere before.

19
00:00:50.166 --> 00:00:51.633
What nonsense are you talking about?

20
00:00:52.566 --> 00:00:53.366
Liming house

21
00:00:57.166 --> 00:00:58.666
Where did you pick it up?

22
00:00:58.666 --> 00:00:59.566
Ha ha.

23
00:01:00.533 --> 00:01:03.400
Trash can, this seems to be a famous brand

24
00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.100
Just one.

25
00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.566
It would be nice if there were two, hahaha moisture.

26
00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:14.800
Don't drink don't drink don't drink

27
00:01:17.166 --> 00:01:19.900
Okay, what happened at the intersection of Anyang last night

28
00:01:20.133 --> 00:01:21.200
A girl died

29
00:01:21.533 --> 00:01:22.566
It's pretty long.

30
00:01:22.566 --> 00:01:26.233
No, it's a pity to be so young, only 24 years old

31
00:01:28.933 --> 00:01:30.400
I killed Sun Yifei

32
00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.900
I killed him with my own hands

33
00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.566
Sir, I have always known your heart

34
00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.833
It's just that we don't have a chance to be together anymore

35
00:01:41.466 --> 00:01:42.266
i

36
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.833
With him with him

37
00:01:45.533 --> 00:01:48.200
Satisfy with him and you again

38
00:01:48.766 --> 00:01:50.200
I will be satisfied with you again.

39
00:01:51.333 --> 00:01:52.266
I am 30 years old.

40
00:01:53.166 --> 00:01:53.966
Me

41
00:01:54.366 --> 00:01:55.233
Gurgling

42
00:01:55.366 --> 00:01:57.633
Hahahahaha

43
00:01:58.166 --> 00:02:01.566
Oh girlfriend, I finally found Uncle Pao

44
00:02:02.133 --> 00:02:03.400

45
00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:09.000
Every day is dead hahahahahaha
