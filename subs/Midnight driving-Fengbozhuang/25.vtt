00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.833
You you

2
00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:03.166
You are all ghosts

3
00:00:03.333 --> 00:00:05.600
They're all here to hurt me, right?

4
00:00:05.866 --> 00:00:07.500
Master Du, what's the matter with you?

5
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.066
Go away go away

6
00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:12.400
I-I was just gone.

7
00:00:13.533 --> 00:00:15.700
I have paid what I should have paid

8
00:00:15.766 --> 00:00:19.166
Why are you still entangled?

9
00:00:21.266 --> 00:00:23.066
I don't want to express my selfishness

10
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:24.800
No.

11
00:00:25.933 --> 00:00:27.166
Can't do it.

12
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:28.833
I can't die either

13
00:00:29.133 --> 00:00:31.166
I have a son to raise

14
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:34.066
Han Mingchuan, do you know him?

15
00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.566
Don't force me!

16
00:00:37.666 --> 00:00:39.666
Zhou, calm down

17
00:00:39.933 --> 00:00:40.766
you

18
00:00:41.566 --> 00:00:45.100
Did Baiyun come out and send you to torture me?

19
00:00:45.333 --> 00:00:46.133
you

20
00:00:55.366 --> 00:00:56.433
It's the coffin soldier

21
00:00:56.866 --> 00:00:58.000
He's dying.

22
00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.266
Let him go back quickly

23
00:00:59.266 --> 00:01:01.366
I helped him nail the coffin out

24
00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:02.666
Remove the venom

25
00:01:02.733 --> 00:01:04.566
There may still be a chance

26
00:01:04.566 --> 00:01:05.833
How is that possible?

27
00:01:05.866 --> 00:01:07.200
Don't you understand?

28
00:01:07.266 --> 00:01:09.500
Bai Mingchuan wants to borrow your hand to control Zhou Jianzhou

29
00:01:09.566 --> 00:01:10.600
For his use

30
00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.766
Come on, he's dying.

31
00:01:12.766 --> 00:01:13.900
He can't make

32
00:01:14.166 --> 00:01:16.066
He is the key to breaking the game

33
00:01:16.066 --> 00:01:17.500
Get him back
