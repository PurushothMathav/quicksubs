00:00:01.333 --> 00:00:03.400
What does this 98 mean?

2
00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:10.233
Yufei is the 98th ghost

3
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.966
And the 99th.

4
00:00:12.966 --> 00:00:15.500
The 100th may be the last

5
00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.000
Is it the last one?

6
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.300
Haha, not necessarily.

7
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.766
It could be.

8
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.766
In the intermediary that costs you

9
00:00:26.533 --> 00:00:29.566
He might be the one Bloodwater has to deal with

10
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:30.666
This kid?

11
00:00:31.133 --> 00:00:32.866
Lots of secrets

12
00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:34.200
OK

13
00:00:35.066 --> 00:00:38.000
Ah Chen is making you a scapegoat

14
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.800
Hahaha, that's right.

15
00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.200
If it's okay, furry boy, I'll provoke it too, it's okay

16
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:43.566
Let's go find him

17
00:00:44.933 --> 00:00:47.066
But where does Zhou Junzhong live?

18
00:00:47.733 --> 00:00:50.033
Yes, Master Haha.

19
00:00:50.366 --> 00:00:51.866
You are obviously an expert

20
00:00:51.866 --> 00:00:54.766
Why are you pretending to be crazy and praying around?

21
00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.200
Prayer is my bread and butter.

22
00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:03.500
It is my life's duty to maintain the small river on earth

23
00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.233
Where does Zhou Zhendong live?

24
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.300
I don't know.

25
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:10.566
Stop making trouble

26
00:01:10.566 --> 00:01:13.966
Human life is at stake, hahahahaha

27
00:01:14.766 --> 00:01:17.633
Master, this is the night you got in the car

28
00:01:17.666 --> 00:01:20.433
I found a water talisman on Zhou Jianzhong

29
00:01:20.733 --> 00:01:23.500
Half on him and half on me

30
00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:24.700
Hahaha
