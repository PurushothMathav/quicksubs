1
00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:02.930
Bought for me.

2
00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:04.870
English, although you say you don’t want to buy a car,

3
00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:07.100
But I ride the electric bike every day,

4
00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:10.480
You have no inconvenience, so I gave you so many cars.

5
00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:14.170
Brother, you bought too much.

6
00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.149
It's okay, I broke two of them every day.

7
00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:19.910
Ah, Miss Gu,

8
00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:22.070
If it’s no big deal, I’ll leave first.

9
00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.170
Okay, nothing happened, just drive away.

10
00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:27.280
Well, how do you have the money to buy so many cars.

11
00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:29.920
It's up to you.

12
00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:32.090
In the house, the money to buy a car,

13
00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:34.430
Did you steal it when you were kicked out by the Gu family?

14
00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:07.850
Fang Li would never do that kind of thing

15
00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:10.260
If you say she won't do it, she won't do it.

16
00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:15.930
You are a high-level person like me

17
00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.430
What do you know about this phone call?
