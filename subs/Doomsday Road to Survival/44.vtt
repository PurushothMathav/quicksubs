1
00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:01.233
Get in the car!

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.200
Not good, Liu Wei's poison gas has spread

3
00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:11.866
Can you estimate his mutation time?

4
00:00:11.866 --> 00:00:13.466
The timing of your mileage may vary

5
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:14.600
I'm not sure about that either.

6
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:15.400
relative

7
00:00:15.866 --> 00:00:17.200
If I develop symptoms

8
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:18.700
You must kill me

9
00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:19.533
You're going to be okay.

10
00:00:19.533 --> 00:00:22.066
We will go to S City immediately to develop the serum pair.

11
00:00:22.166 --> 00:00:24.000
S City has the most advanced equipment in the world

12
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.600
Helps me study serum

13
00:00:25.766 --> 00:00:28.300
Maybe you can find a way to leave the tail at that time

14
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.066
Go fleet

15
00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:31.166
Just go.

16
00:00:57.966 --> 00:00:58.966
This is for you.

17
00:00:59.966 --> 00:01:01.100
Here it is.

18
00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.600
This is the latest development in our laboratory.

19
00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:04.900
Drugs against mutant viruses

20
00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:06.266
But there's no clinical trial.

21
00:01:06.266 --> 00:01:08.366
Is there any effect or side effects?

22
00:01:08.366 --> 00:01:09.500
I don't know either.

23
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.366
But I thought, just in case. Yeah.
