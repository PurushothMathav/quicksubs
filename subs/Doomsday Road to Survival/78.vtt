WEBVTT

1
00:00:05.266 --> 00:00:06.766
This is the launch site

2
00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:09.100
As soon as we inject the serum

3
00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:10.366
As the nuclear bomb exploded

4
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.400
Serum melts into atomic structure and hydroxide

5
00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:14.800
With external exposure

6
00:00:15.266 --> 00:00:16.866
And breathing into the body

7
00:00:17.133 --> 00:00:19.866
As long as mutants inhale the blood in the air

8
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:22.033
Will regain consciousness

9
00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:25.166
We can save the infected of all mankind

10
00:00:26.366 --> 00:00:28.200
But if we put the nuclear bomb

11
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.433
Detonated at the headquarters of the Sakura Organization

12
00:00:30.666 --> 00:00:32.133
What about the people around?

13
00:00:32.133 --> 00:00:32.500
actually

14
00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.266
The Sakura Organization has long regarded it as an experimental area

15
00:00:35.966 --> 00:00:37.900
On the first day of the mutant outbreak

16
00:00:38.333 --> 00:00:40.633
The death rate there is already 100%

17
00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:42.600
They are really crazy

18
00:00:43.333 --> 00:00:44.833
This happened today

19
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.533
Maybe they suffer the consequences

20
00:00:46.533 --> 00:00:48.300
If it weren't for their Yoshiko ambitions

21
00:00:48.333 --> 00:00:50.833
Our world will not become blindly creative

22
00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:51.700
Xiaofan

23
00:00:52.366 --> 00:00:54.833
10% off famous flowers make us lose our loved ones

24
00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:56.166
This time

25
00:00:56.166 --> 00:00:58.000
We must destroy their white dreams

26
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.733
Jiang Fan, quickly inject the serum into the nuclear bomb

27
00:01:00.733 --> 00:01:02.200
Lest he harm more people

28
00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.100
Everything is ready

29
00:01:06.766 --> 00:01:08.100
Just press this button

30
00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.400
Our World

31
00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:11.966
Peace can be restored
