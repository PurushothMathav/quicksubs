00:00:00.466 --> 00:00:01.300
This noon.

2
00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:02.066
Worldwide

3
00:00:02.066 --> 00:00:04.066
Suddenly, many unknown monsters appeared

4
00:00:04.066 --> 00:00:05.166
Relevant department report

5
00:00:05.166 --> 00:00:07.000
Radar is 1 kilometer below the Arctic ice

6
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:07.900
We've got one.

7
00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:09.500
Huge unknown marine creature

8
00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:10.400
For your safety.

9
00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.866
Residents, please close your doors and do not go out.

10
00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:16.000
Business mutations are caused by mutated viruses

11
00:00:17.466 --> 00:00:19.666
It seems that the virus may be about to break out early

12
00:00:19.666 --> 00:00:22.166
So we need to make the bleeding serum ASAP.

13
00:00:22.166 --> 00:00:23.966
But to completely extinguish a virus

14
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:25.800
We've got to get to the root of the problem.

15
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.400
But the biological chain test of the virus

16
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.800
The source has not been traced

17
00:00:31.166 --> 00:00:33.500
It is caused by the release of nuclear wastewater from the island country

18
00:00:33.666 --> 00:00:35.100
I'm going back to the academy right now

19
00:00:35.533 --> 00:00:37.266
Find a way to solve the virus

20
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.566
Captain, can you escort me back?

21
00:00:58.900 --> 00:00:59.800
Marco

22
00:01:00.466 --> 00:01:01.300
Oh, dear.

23
00:01:02.466 --> 00:01:03.266
Marco

24
00:01:10.733 --> 00:01:11.533
army

25
00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.266
Let's go, it's too late
