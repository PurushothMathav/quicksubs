00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:03.200
Instructor, why are you here?

2
00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:04.466
You kid is in danger

3
00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:05.966
We will definitely come to rescue you

4
00:00:05.966 --> 00:00:08.700
But now the world is in chaos

5
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:09.833
Limited mutants

6
00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:12.100
All this conspiracy

7
00:00:12.966 --> 00:00:14.766
It's all about the Sakura Organization

8
00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.766
Luckily I found an MD and a PhD in biology

9
00:00:17.766 --> 00:00:19.066
Ready to develop serum

10
00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.300
But it's bound to be difficult along the way

11
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.300
I implore the instructors

12
00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:27.166
Come out and help me

13
00:00:27.166 --> 00:00:29.600
Jiang Fan, you have your mission

14
00:00:29.866 --> 00:00:31.766
We also have our past

15
00:00:31.933 --> 00:00:34.366
I believe without us

16
00:00:34.366 --> 00:00:36.900
You and your friends can also solve the problem

17
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:40.000
But Xiaoying can only leave the eagle's wings

18
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.466
To truly grow

19
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:42.833
Throw it to the sky

20
00:00:43.266 --> 00:00:46.000
Jiang Fan, you were handed over by the four of us

21
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.400
I know your ability.

22
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:48.666
Even without us

23
00:00:48.733 --> 00:00:49.566
You can do it too.

24
00:00:49.566 --> 00:00:50.833
I see.

25
00:00:51.866 --> 00:00:53.500
Thank you, instructors. Come on

26
00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:56.633
Come on.

27
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.100
Come on.

28
00:01:08.666 --> 00:01:11.066
We are now going to the tea mountain refuge fish
