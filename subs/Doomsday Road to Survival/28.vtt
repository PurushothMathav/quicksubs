00:00:00.766 --> 00:00:03.600
Big brother Jiang Fan saved me, I owe him my life

2
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:04.700
You let them stay

3
00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:06.666
It's already a fucking life

4
00:00:06.666 --> 00:00:08.766
What other supplies are you sending?

5
00:00:08.766 --> 00:00:10.400
You have to do something.

6
00:00:10.933 --> 00:00:12.700
They won't be here long

7
00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:13.533
After finding the supplies

8
00:00:13.533 --> 00:00:15.466
They go to the lab and make the serum

9
00:00:15.466 --> 00:00:16.933
When the time comes to lift the virus mutation

10
00:00:16.933 --> 00:00:17.833
recovery event

11
00:00:17.866 --> 00:00:19.600
We wouldn't be hanging around like this.

12
00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:20.800
Alive here

13
00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.433
So I have to help him.

14
00:00:22.466 --> 00:00:23.666
Can help you

15
00:00:23.666 --> 00:00:24.866
Half of the supplies will be divided into you.

16
00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:27.766
But you can't let the underlings know about this.

17
00:00:29.866 --> 00:00:32.100
Leave the supplies to us, you can rest early.

18
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:33.300
We'll be right back

19
00:00:33.366 --> 00:00:34.566
Then you pay attention to safety

20
00:00:34.566 --> 00:00:35.366
OK

21
00:00:36.133 --> 00:00:36.933
Ah!

22
00:00:38.966 --> 00:00:41.200
Don't be afraid, I'll go out and have a look.

23
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.700
See how coquettish people are

24
00:00:51.866 --> 00:00:52.933
Oh explain

25
00:00:52.933 --> 00:00:53.800
It's me it's me

26
00:00:54.166 --> 00:00:55.033
Liu Wei

27
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.533
Weren't you in your room just now?

28
00:00:57.533 --> 00:00:59.766
