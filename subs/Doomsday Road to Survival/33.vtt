00:00:01.466 --> 00:00:04.366
Captain Jiang heard that you went to the arena last night

2
00:00:04.466 --> 00:00:05.866
Are you okay bro?

3
00:00:05.866 --> 00:00:06.933
I'm not okay?

4
00:00:06.933 --> 00:00:09.000
There were small forces roaming outside the camp last night

5
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.400
I went to deal with it and couldn't make it back.

6
00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:11.333
I'm so sorry.

7
00:00:11.333 --> 00:00:13.100
It's okay, it's all brothers.

8
00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:14.166
Don't be so polite.

9
00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:16.000
Zhao Yang, I was just looking for you

10
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.500
I need that map on you

11
00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:20.066
Captain Jiang, how did you know I had a map on me?

12
00:00:20.066 --> 00:00:21.666
I can't explain it to you yet.

13
00:00:21.666 --> 00:00:22.966
This is something I drew recently.

14
00:00:22.966 --> 00:00:25.233
Detailed five-character map within a 10-kilometer radius

15
00:00:25.666 --> 00:00:28.000
It's great to use it

16
00:00:28.733 --> 00:00:29.566
OK

17
00:00:33.366 --> 00:00:35.700
What should I do? This place is empty.

18
00:00:36.133 --> 00:00:37.466
No one.

19
00:00:37.966 --> 00:00:39.500
What's wrong? That's not good.

20
00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:40.566
Do you want to meet mutants?

21
00:00:40.566 --> 00:00:43.200
Most of the residents here have entered the camp

22
00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:44.700
So there are no mutants.

23
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.366
But it is not ruled out that there is a possibility

24
00:00:46.766 --> 00:00:49.000
So be careful.

25
00:00:50.733 --> 00:00:52.266
Oh look

26
00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:54.466
Xiao Qi I Zhao

27
00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:56.700
It's okay, I'll be back when I go.

28
00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:03.100
Who?

29
00:01:05.333 --> 00:01:07.000
Grandpa me
