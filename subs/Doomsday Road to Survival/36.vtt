00:00:08.966 --> 00:00:11.166
This is the rescue you two idiots brought in

2
00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:34.100
Ah!

3
00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.066
How about brother brother brother

4
00:00:36.366 --> 00:00:37.366
How did that happen?

5
00:00:37.933 --> 00:00:40.366
It was you who saved us, otherwise what?

6
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.533
Ghosts saved us saved you

7
00:00:42.533 --> 00:00:44.166
I can't avenge you with kindness

8
00:00:44.166 --> 00:00:45.300
Can't beat us

9
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.000
Get out of the way if you know

10
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.033
It's a big delay, you can't afford it

11
00:00:51.133 --> 00:00:52.800
I think they're pretty good

12
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.333
Are we weak?

13
00:00:54.333 --> 00:00:55.566
It's better to hang out with them

14
00:00:56.133 --> 00:01:00.000
Uh uh tell them tell them hey

15
00:01:00.333 --> 00:01:02.700
Can our brothers discuss that?

16
00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:04.466
Anyway, we are like street mice

17
00:01:04.466 --> 00:01:05.566
The one who is hiding is

18
00:01:05.566 --> 00:01:06.766
This is not the way

19
00:01:06.766 --> 00:01:08.466
Just let's recognize you as big brothers in the future

20
00:01:08.466 --> 00:01:09.866
Hang out with you

21
00:01:09.866 --> 00:01:10.700
You

22
00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.066
It's really different from the attitude just now.

23
00:01:13.066 --> 00:01:13.733
That would be fine.

24
00:01:13.733 --> 00:01:14.733
Everyone coexists peacefully

25
00:01:14.733 --> 00:01:16.566
It's powerful to people

26
00:01:16.566 --> 00:01:17.733
I think so.

27
00:01:17.733 --> 00:01:19.766
I'll mess with you in the future, yeah

28
00:01:19.766 --> 00:01:21.800
We'll follow you wherever you go.

29
00:01:21.966 --> 00:01:24.633
I need to go to the chemistry lab now

30
00:01:25.666 --> 00:01:28.200
I know come with me I know
