00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:01.700
No, sorry.

2
00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:04.000
It's not your fault that I didn't protect you well

3
00:00:04.133 --> 00:00:05.833
No one wants this to happen.

4
00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:10.400
Wang Xinyi, if I say I mean the worst plan?

5
00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.466
After all, I'm not sure yet.

6
00:00:12.466 --> 00:00:14.100
Is it because of my appearance?

7
00:00:14.133 --> 00:00:16.600
That led to the change throughout history

8
00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:17.900
Dr. Zhang Jiajia Variation

9
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.000
If so

10
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.033
You're the only one left in the next serum study

11
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.266
Are you sure?

12
00:00:24.266 --> 00:00:25.666
Let's be honest.

13
00:00:25.666 --> 00:00:27.800
No if as you said

14
00:00:28.066 --> 00:00:30.766
The last life was a serum that I developed with Jiajia

15
00:00:30.766 --> 00:00:33.233
Then the two of us should be complementary existences

16
00:00:33.533 --> 00:00:34.633
But it can't

17
00:00:34.666 --> 00:00:35.866
Obviously there are materials

18
00:00:35.933 --> 00:00:37.066
Why not give it to them?

19
00:00:37.066 --> 00:00:38.666
This auspicious so many brothers

20
00:00:38.766 --> 00:00:40.700
What mouth doesn't wait to eat?

21
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.133
I'm already giving you face by letting them stay.

22
00:00:43.133 --> 00:00:46.566
Brother, he is my comrade-in-arms

23
00:00:46.866 --> 00:00:48.900
So many brothers in this base

24
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.066
Which one is not too close to us?

25
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:54.800
All right, I'll give them my supplies.

26
00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.100
You are such a big base

27
00:00:58.366 --> 00:01:01.800
I'll give them all to you later.

28
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.733
You are always so emotional

29
00:01:03.733 --> 00:01:06.000
How can these brothers help you in the future?
