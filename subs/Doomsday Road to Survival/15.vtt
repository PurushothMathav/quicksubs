00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:01.900
I don't care if you are the captain or not

2
00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:02.966
Hurry up and talk to Lao Tzu

3
00:00:02.966 --> 00:00:05.066
Or kill them?

4
00:00:13.933 --> 00:00:15.366
Ahhh

5
00:00:17.266 --> 00:00:19.300
You think you can do magic, I'm afraid of you

6
00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.700
If it weren't for the original owner of the mountain of our Blackwater Society

7
00:00:21.733 --> 00:00:23.166
Convert the warehouse into a camp

8
00:00:23.166 --> 00:00:25.466
This has already become the territory of mutants

9
00:00:25.466 --> 00:00:26.966
Don't take us seriously

10
00:00:26.966 --> 00:00:28.866
Believe it or not, I'll throw you out now.

11
00:00:28.866 --> 00:00:29.400
Ask mutants

12
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:30.666
There is no way for us to survive

13
00:00:31.166 --> 00:00:32.266
You don't want to live either

14
00:00:32.266 --> 00:00:33.900
Liu Wei Jiangdun

15
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:35.233
There we go.

16
00:00:35.366 --> 00:00:37.233
It's not impossible for Xiaojin Camp

17
00:00:37.333 --> 00:00:38.400
Promise me a condition

18
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:39.766
I reward you with a life

19
00:00:39.966 --> 00:00:40.966
What do you want?

20
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.000
Leave all your supplies and weapons behind

21
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.833
Why don't you go grab it?

22
00:00:45.866 --> 00:00:47.533
Weapons and supplies are left to you

23
00:00:47.533 --> 00:00:48.966
What's the difference between us and waiting to die?

24
00:00:48.966 --> 00:00:50.800
What the hell does that have to do with me?

25
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.266
If I say no

26
00:00:53.366 --> 00:00:54.266
Stop
