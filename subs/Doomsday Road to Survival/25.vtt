00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:01.766
How many of you?

2
00:00:02.266 --> 00:00:03.600
Come with me!

3
00:00:10.333 --> 00:00:13.366
Don't be surprised by what happened to Xiaofan just now.

4
00:00:13.366 --> 00:00:15.900
Am I also looking out for the overall situation?

5
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.966
They were also shot by the virus

6
00:00:17.966 --> 00:00:20.300
We shouldn't have to decide whether they live or die.

7
00:00:20.733 --> 00:00:23.033
This is the base.

8
00:00:23.266 --> 00:00:26.866
A topographic map of a 1,000-kilometer radius. Wow.

9
00:00:27.133 --> 00:00:28.466
It's 2072

10
00:00:28.466 --> 00:00:30.333
I never thought I'd see another map like this

11
00:00:30.333 --> 00:00:31.966
Fortunately, I have it.

12
00:00:32.933 --> 00:00:34.066
Mutation begins

13
00:00:34.066 --> 00:00:36.433
All communication systems were cut off

14
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.600
The satellite dish was also instantly turned off.

15
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.766
This satellite signal will take 3 years to repair

16
00:00:43.766 --> 00:00:45.866
How do you know he's from the Special Forces?

17
00:00:45.866 --> 00:00:46.866
Of course he knew.

18
00:00:48.366 --> 00:00:49.700
The reason I know

19
00:00:49.966 --> 00:00:51.666
It's because I'm from 8 years later

20
00:00:51.666 --> 00:00:53.433
What do you mean by that?

21
00:00:53.466 --> 00:00:56.866
So eight years later, eight years later, is this crisis over?

22
00:00:56.933 --> 00:00:58.366
The crisis was not resolved

23
00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.000
It got worse
