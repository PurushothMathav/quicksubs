1
00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:02.566
Let's go and see Dr. Zhang

2
00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:11.166
How could this be?

3
00:00:12.666 --> 00:00:14.800
Did every family mutate in the past life?

4
00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:15.800
Never heard of it.

5
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.233
Never heard of it.

6
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:18.366
That is no variation

7
00:00:18.366 --> 00:00:19.500
You shouldn't.

8
00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:21.900
Things that never happened in a previous life

9
00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.966
It shouldn't happen in this life, right?

10
00:00:23.966 --> 00:00:25.800
What will be done?

11
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.000
Dr. Zhang's variation

12
00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.800
The people in this camp will soon find out

13
00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.066
Everyone protect him

14
00:00:31.066 --> 00:00:31.866
You see

15
00:00:32.466 --> 00:00:34.066
The treetops are green

16
00:00:34.733 --> 00:00:35.900
That is to say

17
00:00:35.966 --> 00:00:37.833
He got the infection from a bite.

18
00:00:44.466 --> 00:00:46.200
I want to extract the structure of the mutant virus

19
00:00:51.866 --> 00:00:54.033
Jiang Fan, I need a microscope

20
00:00:55.366 --> 00:00:55.766
Humph

21
00:00:55.766 --> 00:00:58.233
You actually brought mutants to a small safe area?

22
00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.633
I already knew you were a scourge

23
00:01:00.866 --> 00:01:03.000
Say you bring this thing up

24
00:01:03.166 --> 00:01:04.000
For what purpose?
