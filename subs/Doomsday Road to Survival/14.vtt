00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:09.566
Parking parking parking

2
00:00:13.766 --> 00:00:16.700
It's too much, you're not alone in the refugee camp

3
00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:17.933
Why don't you let us see

4
00:00:17.933 --> 00:00:21.400
It's too much, my mother, there's even more too much

5
00:00:22.766 --> 00:00:25.466
Believe it or not, I will fight for you to stop

6
00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:28.266
For you

7
00:00:28.266 --> 00:00:30.433
Okay, don't go in there

8
00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:34.400
What are you looking at?

9
00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:35.500
Get out of here

10
00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.200
What horses and dogs stay in the tea mountain sanctuary together

11
00:00:38.366 --> 00:00:39.266
I bah

12
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.166
Captain Jiang's sister-in-law is called Queen

13
00:00:51.266 --> 00:00:52.633
Is the thorn of the camp

14
00:00:52.666 --> 00:00:53.766
You should pay more attention in the future

15
00:00:53.933 --> 00:00:54.966
This big brother

16
00:00:54.966 --> 00:00:56.633
I'm the captain of this squad

17
00:00:56.733 --> 00:00:58.533
Now there's a mutant virus.

18
00:00:58.533 --> 00:01:00.766
We just narrowly escaped from a train

19
00:01:00.766 --> 00:01:03.233
I hope you can take us in temporarily
