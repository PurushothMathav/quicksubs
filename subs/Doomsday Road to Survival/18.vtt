00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:01.400
8 years later

2
00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:04.933
Team Na, you were so excited to see us in the car

3
00:00:04.933 --> 00:00:06.266
Crying and hugging

4
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:07.966
Did we sacrifice long ago?

5
00:00:08.733 --> 00:00:09.533
Yes!

6
00:00:11.333 --> 00:00:12.133
Will Shield

7
00:00:12.733 --> 00:00:14.600
Where did you learn to flash from?

8
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:15.600
This one.

9
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.666
Maybe it's because of my ability to travel through time

10
00:00:18.666 --> 00:00:21.800
What will it be like eight years later?

11
00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.000
Doomsday human extinction

12
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.466
Not a shield

13
00:00:25.766 --> 00:00:26.900
Why the end?

14
00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:28.733
All because of the Sakura Organization

15
00:00:28.733 --> 00:00:30.266
We must destroy them

16
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:32.600
Otherwise, after 8 years

17
00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:34.466
Humans will cease to exist

18
00:00:34.466 --> 00:00:36.000
But the most important thing now is

19
00:00:36.566 --> 00:00:38.100
Make hemorrhage first

20
00:00:38.333 --> 00:00:41.300
Didn't you say we had developed a serum?

21
00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:42.133
How can it end?

22
00:00:42.133 --> 00:00:44.166
At that time, you were making hemorrhage.

23
00:00:44.166 --> 00:00:45.400
But it's too late

24
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.600
So now we have to make it as soon as possible

25
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:49.966
Then can you tell us?

26
00:00:49.966 --> 00:00:51.900
Something about mutants?

27
00:00:51.933 --> 00:00:53.300
In this way, my favorite research party

28
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:54.933
It will also be more accurate

29
00:00:54.933 --> 00:00:57.700
I only know that mutants are through blood

30
00:00:57.733 --> 00:00:59.800
Food and seafood transmission
