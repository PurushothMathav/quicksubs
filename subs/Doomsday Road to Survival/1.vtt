Global Outbreak Unknown Cheap Rate

3
00:00:06.066 --> 00:00:07.666
Infected people mutate everywhere

4
00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:10.566
The rainstorm is bloodthirsty and brutal as fast as lightning

5
00:00:11.133 --> 00:00:12.600
Things were thrown into chaos

6
00:00:12.866 --> 00:00:13.766

mutant virus outbreak

8
00:00:23.766 --> 00:00:26.033
After 8 years, the mutated blood was successfully developed

9
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:28.400
But we're almost extinct.

10
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:29.500
It's too late.

11
00:00:29.566 --> 00:00:31.266
Survivors are unresponsive

12
00:00:31.366 --> 00:00:32.500
Separate party

13
00:00:33.566 --> 00:00:34.933
Everyone pay more attention

14
00:00:34.933 --> 00:00:35.766
No movement yet

15
00:00:35.966 --> 00:00:37.666
It's the captain, look

16
00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:46.233

17
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.300
Full fire

18
00:01:14.733 --> 00:01:17.066
I don't accept this ending

19
00:01:21.566 --> 00:01:24.400
Swimming pool, am I not in the sea?

20
00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.400
Hello, I am

21
00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.000
Captain Zhang, where are you?

22
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.300
You're missing the departure.

23
00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:33.800
Liu Wei, isn't he dead?
