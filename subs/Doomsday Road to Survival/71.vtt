00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.466
I want to use myself for a serum experiment

2
00:00:09.466 --> 00:00:11.200
No, I don't agree.

3
00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:13.300
I have already decided on this matter.

4
00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:15.166
Then we have to wait for Brother Jiang to wake up.

5
00:00:15.166 --> 00:00:16.466
Talk it over with him.

6
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.066
Although the serum we have now developed

7
00:00:19.066 --> 00:00:20.900
But there's a lack of human data.

8
00:00:20.933 --> 00:00:22.066
None of us can guarantee it.

9
00:00:22.066 --> 00:00:24.066
Is the serum really developed successfully?

10
00:00:24.066 --> 00:00:25.633
Only after the test

11
00:00:25.866 --> 00:00:27.700
And there just happen to be two tubes of serum right now

12
00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.133
If my experiment is successful

13
00:00:29.133 --> 00:00:31.133
Then can't we choose a mutant?

14
00:00:31.133 --> 00:00:33.133
Isn't the life of the mutant human life?

15
00:00:33.133 --> 00:00:34.500
If the serum has no effect

16
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:35.900
The mutant in the experiment died

17
00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:37.166
Or extreme side effects

18
00:00:37.166 --> 00:00:38.100
What to do then?

19
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.866
None of us are qualified to decide

20
00:00:41.866 --> 00:00:43.133
The birth of a life

21
00:00:43.133 --> 00:00:44.233
Or die

22
00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.066
What's more, he is unconscious

23
00:00:46.066 --> 00:00:47.133
No resistance

24
00:00:47.133 --> 00:00:49.233
Even without judgment

25
00:00:49.766 --> 00:00:51.900
But I can decide whether I live or die.

26
00:00:52.333 --> 00:00:54.300
And I'm ready, and I'm on my way.

27
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.300
Preparation for sacrifice

28
00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.600
But making the serum requires your heart

29
00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:59.266
No. And you?

30
00:00:59.533 --> 00:01:00.866
It's up to you from now on

31
00:01:00.866 --> 00:01:04.033
And you know there's no one better suited than me

32
00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.266
I'm not here to discuss it with you

33
00:01:06.266 --> 00:01:08.666
If you don't agree, I'll leave now.
