00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.766
Now this is not what we want to fight

2
00:00:02.766 --> 00:00:04.200
If you hadn't saved him

3
00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:05.200
He won't die either.

4
00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.033
Can you calm down?

5
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.366
Yes, he won't die.

6
00:00:09.466 --> 00:00:11.733
Then let him keep walking dead like this

7
00:00:11.733 --> 00:00:13.933
Not living unruly, right?

8
00:00:13.933 --> 00:00:15.966
Are you being too selfish?

9
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:17.300
I'll tell you what.

10
00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.233
No one wants to mutate and live

11
00:00:20.266 --> 00:00:22.500
What do you know?

12
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.766
I don't understand, I ask you

13
00:00:25.066 --> 00:00:26.766
What if it was you who mutated?

14
00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.233
Do you want to accompany your sister so unruly?

15
00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.433
Make his heart hurt when he sees you

16
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.466
Or choose to fall

17
00:00:33.666 --> 00:00:34.900
Don't drag your sister down

18
00:00:35.866 --> 00:00:37.266
What right do you have to say

19
00:00:37.333 --> 00:00:39.300
I'm not trying to teach you a lesson.

20
00:00:39.933 --> 00:00:41.700
I'm just being realistic.

21
00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:43.566
Be reasonable

22
00:00:43.866 --> 00:00:44.966
Can you do it now?

23
00:00:44.966 --> 00:00:47.300
The outside world is already in chaos

24
00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.200
There are countless poor people like your sister

25
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.800
Innocent people exist

26
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.866
They've been infected

27
00:00:52.866 --> 00:00:54.366
If you like.

28
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.700
This tragedy can be stopped

29
00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:58.600
It can also save more people

30
00:00:58.866 --> 00:01:00.200
Have you ever considered

31
00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.433
This might also be what your sister wants to see
