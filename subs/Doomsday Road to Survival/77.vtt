00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:02.266
Hahahaha

2
00:00:02.733 --> 00:00:05.800
Xiaofan, you have no chance

3
00:00:08.866 --> 00:00:10.233
I Sakura Organization

4
00:00:10.466 --> 00:00:12.600
Will become the god of this new world

5
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.100
And you mortals

6
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:16.200
Will become the bird of the new world

7
00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.333
The one who only dares to hide under Apple Mountain

8
00:00:19.333 --> 00:00:21.666
To destroy the fabric of the world by means of grasping

9
00:00:21.766 --> 00:00:23.200
Dare to call God

10
00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:24.900
It's ridiculous

11
00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:25.833
What!

12
00:00:26.733 --> 00:00:29.800
Now that you know our headquarters is under Apple Hill

13
00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.566
Xiaofan, I originally admired it very much

14
00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.266
I want to leave you a way out

15
00:00:34.266 --> 00:00:36.900
But now you just have to die

16
00:00:37.133 --> 00:00:39.866
Grim Reaper this time I will make peace

17
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.633
Tread down your cherry blossom tissue

18
00:00:41.666 --> 00:00:43.400
Use the serum to save all mankind

19
00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.466
The conspiracy of your island nation will be completely crushed

20
00:00:47.466 --> 00:00:48.466
overreach

21
00:00:48.466 --> 00:00:49.500
Give me blood

22
00:00:53.933 --> 00:00:55.300
What is this?

23
00:00:55.333 --> 00:00:58.433
So this is your nuclear waste.

24
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:01.066
I'll kill you!

25
00:01:09.533 --> 00:01:10.966
History doesn't repeat itself.

26
00:01:12.366 --> 00:01:14.233
We must go to the launch site immediately

27
00:01:14.266 --> 00:01:15.666
Good to go
