1
00:00:02.466 --> 00:00:05.200
Do it! What do you mean?

2
00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.300
Did you let Jiao Fan kill Jiajia? That's right

3
00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:09.566
Since the moment he mutated

4
00:00:09.566 --> 00:00:11.833
I'm no longer your partner

5
00:00:12.066 --> 00:00:13.300
His body

6
00:00:13.566 --> 00:00:18.033
It's already a shell full of viruses

7
00:00:18.166 --> 00:00:19.200
I'm a doctor.

8
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.166
Give me time.

9
00:00:20.166 --> 00:00:21.466
I can cure him

10
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:22.400
rule

11
00:00:22.866 --> 00:00:24.233
How do you treat it?

12
00:00:24.933 --> 00:00:28.000
His body is out of control

13
00:00:28.533 --> 00:00:30.133
Just driving around

14
00:00:30.133 --> 00:00:32.366
I once said I would protect him

15
00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:37.100
So it's up to you to deal with his pain

16
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.666
What do you mean, lad?

17
00:00:40.766 --> 00:00:41.700
Tell the truth

18
00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.400
The purpose of our operation

19
00:00:43.733 --> 00:00:45.033
Is to defuse the virus

20
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.566
Save all mankind

21
00:00:46.666 --> 00:00:47.700
And Zhang Jiajia

22
00:00:47.866 --> 00:00:50.033
One of the point persons

23
00:00:50.366 --> 00:00:52.700
So I couldn't kill him.

24
00:00:53.266 --> 00:00:56.600
Humming can't be said so big

25
00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.200
Don't give people meaningless hope

26
00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:00.233
President Ouyang

27
00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.000
If it is your relative

28
00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:03.966
Are you infected with the virus?

29
00:01:04.133 --> 00:01:05.866
Would you kill him yourself?

30
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.700
Compare your heart to your heart, President Ouyang
