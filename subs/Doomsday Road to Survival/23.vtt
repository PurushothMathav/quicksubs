00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.366
What are you talking about?

2
00:00:01.366 --> 00:00:02.466
He is not a thing

3
00:00:02.466 --> 00:00:03.666
He is our partner.

4
00:00:03.666 --> 00:00:05.066
Haha partner

5
00:00:05.766 --> 00:00:06.700
Come come come

6
00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:07.600
Put him

7
00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:10.566
And his mutant partner is wrapped and steamed out

8
00:00:10.566 --> 00:00:12.500
I think your skin is itchy.

9
00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:13.866
Even if you have some patience

10
00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:16.400
Can't help but pay attention to us?

11
00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.533
Hey, he's been brought under control.

12
00:00:18.533 --> 00:00:19.500
It won't hurt.

13
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.066
You think I'm stupid

14
00:00:21.066 --> 00:00:23.266
Just wear this thing for ten wear a hundred

15
00:00:23.366 --> 00:00:26.300
You want my whole camp to die with you?

16
00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.266
I don't think you can get rid of it

17
00:00:29.266 --> 00:00:32.066
This woman has been in the camp since

18
00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:34.200
Just started to become mutants

19
00:00:34.666 --> 00:00:36.000
Your disease

20
00:00:36.866 --> 00:00:38.733
Who knows when it will happen?

21
00:00:38.733 --> 00:00:41.066
You have to cut them out.

22
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.266
General, this is not the way to go

23
00:00:43.333 --> 00:00:44.633
We have to figure it out.

24
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:46.600
Want to stay

25
00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:48.866
Can you?

26
00:00:49.333 --> 00:00:51.000
Let me check it out.

27
00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.566
Are there any tooth marks left by mutants on your body?

28
00:00:54.566 --> 00:00:55.700
Don't go too far.

29
00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:56.733
Now let's get out of here.

30
00:00:56.733 --> 00:00:58.000
Isn't that sending us to death?

31
00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.833
I was looking for it on purpose before

32
00:00:59.866 --> 00:01:02.366
But now you can bring mutants

33
00:01:02.366 --> 00:01:04.400
That's against the whole camp

34
00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:05.800
Now the world suffers.

35
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.533
I don't want to take action against the remaining survivors

36
00:01:08.533 --> 00:01:10.933
I advise you not to be ignorant of praise

37
00:01:10.933 --> 00:01:11.900
Cut the crap

38
00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:14.466
If you wanted a pistol, I would have killed you already

39
00:01:14.466 --> 00:01:15.966
No future trouble

40
00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:17.866
Give it to me don't go

41
00:01:23.566 --> 00:01:25.800
I'm producing wildflowers for the camp

42
00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.500
It shouldn't be you who's going to do it
