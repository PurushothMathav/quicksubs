00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:06.990
I really like this age, this and that look,

2
00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:08.610
I like this age now.

3
00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.660
This one looks like that, I like it at this age. This thing looks like this, I like this age. This thing looks like this, I like this age. This thing looks like this, I like this age. This one looks like that, I like that look at this age, I

4
00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:12.780
I like how I look at this age,

5
00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.380
I like this age and that way, I like this age and that way, I like this age and that way, I like this age and that way, I

6
00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:17.350
I like the way I am at this age, I like the way I am at this age,

7
00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:25.140
I like that at this age,

8
00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.990

11
00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:43.920
I like that at this age,

12
00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:46.200
I like this year

13
00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:58.870
The starting frame is three million and five people are in the United States. How old are they?

14
00:00:58.870 --> 00:00:59.970
Besides being so beautiful

15
00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:02.980
Why did you send it here for filming? Please ask the officials.

16
00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.470
If you ask an official, you will be very polite.

17
00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:06.230
Exactly why

18
00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.070
Because as long as you write

19
00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:08.810
you are dead

20
00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:09.930
my mother's girl

21
00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.580
My mother's electrical department can only be counted in a few words.

22
00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.940
If I keep my attitude high

23
00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:16.120
What's wrong with him

24
00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:17.280
What's on your mind

25
00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.520
what does he want

26
00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:23.120
I need a few kids

27
00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.180
I can only use this

28
00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:29.000
Return a few words to the Ministry of Electrical and Electronics

29
00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:41.660
Where to start now?

30
00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:42.240
Coming now
