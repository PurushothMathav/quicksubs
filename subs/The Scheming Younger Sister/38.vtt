00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:04.270
You, this young lady, are my Hakka!

2
00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:05.870
Still there?

3
00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:07.790
I went out without sleeping again.

4
00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:10.770
Have you asked clearly?

5
00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:12.010
What do you say over there?

6
00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:16.710
Don't you have any trouble finding her?

7
00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:20.070
We shot people to eat, and it was our people who came back through the flash door.

8
00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:22.480
What? I don’t have any use for it!

9
00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.470
How much does this old lady cost?

10
00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.410
As soon as everyone arrived today, Laochunxu Motorcycle Committee came back!

11
00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:30.470
You can use it! That’s it

12
00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:31.810
Then you just have to take charge and understand.

13
00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:32.790
Your list, I

14
00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:33.830
How unresolved again

15
00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:35.790
What do you mean?

16
00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:41.990
Then you bring my mother back for a forced visit. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

17
00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:43.080
The fat you used

18
00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:45.170
You actually say you don't care anymore

19
00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:46.310
boy rhythm

20
00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:47.710
I am one thing too

21
00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:49.570
Often I haven’t tried the message for half a day

22
00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:53.170
Where do these people I hate come from?

23
00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:53.890
You bite the button

24
00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:55.990
It seems like this guy is too

25
00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:58.790
Indeed, you look so simple again

26
00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:00.190
a young lady

27
00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:03.010
What good things can I eat?

28
00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:04.489
You said last time

29
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:08.480
In fact, she is my woman, you are saying

30
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.320
That young Chinese disciple did it

31
00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.340
Who knows, sir?

32
00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:19.900
It's good for you to be here
