00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:04.970
Central, why are you here?

2
00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:06.710
Why are you here? Why are you here? Why are you here?

3
00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:09.490
Why are you here? Why are you here? Why are you here? Why are you here

4
00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:11.390
Son? Why are you here?

5
00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:13.530
Why are you here? Why are you here?

6
00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.790
Why are you here? Why are you here?

7
00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:18.280
Why are you here? Why are you here?

8
00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:19.920
Why are you here? Why are you here? Why are you here? Why are you here? Why are you here? Why are you here? Why are you here? Why are you here? How are you

9
00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.480
Here? Why are you here? Why are you here? Why are you here? Why are you here? Why are you here? Why are you here? Why are you here? Why are you here? Why are you here? How are you

10
00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.380
Here? Why are you here?

11
00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:24.980
Why are you here?

12
00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:33.720
why are you here

13
00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:35.780
Regardless of brother

14
00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:40.710
Not more valuable than him, right?

15
00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:42.330
Then you should talk about it

16
00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:44.120
What does Miss Shuangya have?

17
00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.220
Get up, sister

18
00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:47.630
this year

19
00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:48.890
Shuangya's entire property

20
00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:50.670
Yes, yes, my mother can transfer points to Antong.

21
00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:53.750
How do you prepare for Shuangya?

22
00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:54.970
Just get nothing

23
00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:58.030
And what you do yourself is to relieve debts

24
00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:00.190
But I will raise a few

25
00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:01.990
I am the one who really uses it

26
00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:04.470
Shuangya’s entire property is worth thousands of gold.

27
00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.710
As long as there are only two of us

28
00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:08.620
You are brave and you are connected

29
00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:12.240
There's no way you can recognize your home first, right?

30
00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:15.050
So what do you mean I usually have no news?

31
00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.540
I can apply for supplementary rights from the company

32
00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:21.020
I said I would forward it to you and I will watch it.

33
00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:24.160
My mother has found all the harvested products these days and I don’t want to anymore.

34
00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:25.700
There is a company here

35
00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:26.860
100% protection

36
00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:28.620
Everything is decided by me

37
00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:30.320
You said it all

38
00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:38.350
You put all the right to make up for it
