00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.290
You locked up, and you wrote about the new gun knife, put it in this first paragraph.

2
00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:14.380
Then, what do you want if your things are not good?

3
00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:16.390
Such an important thing

4
00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:21.050
Mom, donâ€™t forget that Xi Jinping has been bad recently.

5
00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:24.530
That side has to be here no matter what, mom

6
00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:26.090
I always told me

7
00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:28.410
We all turn the company's belly onto ourselves

8
00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:29.990
You will ride me

9
00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:31.870
What did you say bite?

10
00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:33.350
You must be able to charge it

11
00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:34.310
But we can't be weak

12
00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:37.010
This is not the only capital for next year.

13
00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:39.410
You're so slippery from this guy

14
00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:41.730
Be careful to be deceived by him too

15
00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:44.770
I won't lie to you at all

16
00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:45.710
you promise me

17
00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:48.550
As long as I can keep you in the spotlight

18
00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:50.370
You still don't want to go home with me

19
00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.510
You are just too naive

20
00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:54.530
If you transfer this money to him

21
00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:58.750
After all, he's a fire-proof guy, right? Mom knows how to do it.

22
00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:00.540
I believe Brother Style canâ€™t do it

23
00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:01.700
He's the one who's careful

24
00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:03.780
This is also to prevent all financial scams.

25
00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.340
Learned mistakes
