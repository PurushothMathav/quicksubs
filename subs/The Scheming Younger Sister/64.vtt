00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:05.010
Haven't they already lived this engaged life?

2
00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:07.890
This kid is causing trouble again.

3
00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:11.720
Master, I guess you just helped me.

4
00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:13.280
The wedding reception last time.

5
00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.420
We make others confused just by looking at it, but we don’t care about it.

6
00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:19.700
So I guess this is someplace,

7
00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:21.440
For the Ya family that everyone is looking for,

8
00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:22.280
We'll be together.

9
00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:24.400
By the way, he's right

10
00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.680
When you enter the building, you will say whatever you want.

11
00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:28.460
Take a look

12
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:31.720
It didn't matter at the time. What did he do?

13
00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:35.380
What's the matter with him not talking to the dog?

14
00:00:36.430 --> 00:01:00.700
Have you dealt with that later?

15
00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:06.280
Just think about it and bet on it. This is good.

16
00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:11.490
This industry started from my brother

17
00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:12.670
That's it

18
00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:16.030
Especially those who were generals in the Soviet Union

19
00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:19.420
That's the heaviest

20
00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:36.360
Don't do any harm first, right?

21
00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.440
Be happy to improve your quality

22
00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:41.150
Just don't know

23
00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:43.510
Really too high

24
00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:50.020
It could all be very miserable, right?

25
00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:52.800
Just don’t remember how miserable I was

26
00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:53.980
I'm about to be

27
00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:55.720
Your girlfriend, you

28
00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:57.380
What can you give me as proof?
