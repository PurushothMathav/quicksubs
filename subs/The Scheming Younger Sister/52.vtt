00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:05.520
Logically speaking, it doesn't matter how much or how little. I'll give you the wrong one.

2
00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:09.690
Although in this case, it is really disrespectful to ignore people like this.

3
00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:14.020
What's the relationship?

4
00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:19.300
Of course, it depends on whether you seek help or not.

5
00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:24.720
You, you can eat randomly like this,

6
00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.120
Don't talk nonsense.

7
00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:29.820
What about you, what happened before, did you still look the same?

8
00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:35.730
In this case, you see, he went too far and I went too far.

9
00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.180
Now, if you two don't take what if,

10
00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:44.590
You can do better than this.

11
00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:56.700
Why do you like me?

12
00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:57.280
Please also

13
00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:59.020
Thank you for your loss.

14
00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:00.340
19 high hidden

15
00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.910
So I'm like this

16
00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:14.760
The vegetables waiting for you are so bad

17
00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.040
I'm really not hungry

18
00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:18.540
And I still have a few young ones, no problem

19
00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:19.860
I want them all

20
00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:24.540
What about the shoe fee? Hurry up.

21
00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.700
Donâ€™t forget what happened to your test

22
00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:35.890
Don't use it like I keep eating it. It won't come back, but it's okay.

23
00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:37.630
Do you want to come again and treat me to this?

24
00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:39.150
Let me give it a try
