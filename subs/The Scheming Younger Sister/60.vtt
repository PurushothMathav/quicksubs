00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.310
Squeeze your brain, eat fish and fish, wait for the meal.

2
00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.510
But I'm going to be tired today, so I want to drink and eat.

3
00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:12.300
Brother, you have dinner today.

4
00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:15.520
Go back to yourself.

5
00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:17.340
Go home and see off guests.

6
00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.520
Critical time, please.

7
00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:22.620
You're welcome.

8
00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:23.400
Have a meal.

9
00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:29.950
Why don't you try something else?

10
00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:31.590
I'm getting married today.

11
00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:32.750
Finished a sentence.

12
00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.010
He is really a light person with a small waist.

13
00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:43.100
Take it.

14
00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:49.420
I heard it's a rice dish.

15
00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:53.630
Master, what's the matter? that is,

16
00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:01.220
If this can be done, will the vote be closed?

17
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.540
I don’t know if it’s transferred.

18
00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:07.460
You must disperse

19
00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:08.920
I'm tired of this matter.

20
00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:09.960
Don't know how to invest

21
00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:12.870
Don’t mention the high price.

22
00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:15.340
If you want to ask him to pick him up

23
00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:19.140
What do you eat?

24
00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:21.600
There's no need for me to go on either.
