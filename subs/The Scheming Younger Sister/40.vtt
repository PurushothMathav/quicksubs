00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.090
Now what do I promise this ordinary person something from us?

2
00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:14.980
What are the local vows for?

3
00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:20.450
If you dare to come here again, I will drink a lot more and I will put you down.

4
00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:24.160
Because we are still in the middle of doing it.

5
00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:25.700
Have you ever stopped doing it?

6
00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:28.550
say what?

7
00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:29.770
But for what?

8
00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:38.940
What? How could I do this?

9
00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:42.420
Be sure to use one hundred and eighty young men

10
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.000
And how much is the money difference that I donâ€™t hate worth? Of course.

11
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.980
What if you hadn't come to my place today?

12
00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:06.320
Originally, we could control it peacefully when we came here.

13
00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.010
But now you know the same eyes
