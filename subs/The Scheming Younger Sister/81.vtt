00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.090
Let me go and let me agree to the proposal,

2
00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:12.070
It's not impossible, but you will be laughed out loud.

3
00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:17.690
As long as I am qualified, I will definitely come back.

4
00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:21.700
Itâ€™s not that fast, you just need to,

5
00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:28.230
Just give up.

6
00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:29.780
Just think more.

7
00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.500
How? Until now,

8
00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.280
You don't have a term yet, you have weapons that people will analyze,

9
00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:50.320
You find your data.

10
00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.390
You sir, this is the lesson plan for hiding things.

11
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.810
If you just say it's okay, I'm going to,

12
00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.670
Give you this lesson plan.

13
00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:03.710
because of this period of time

14
00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:05.430
I think if you go back

15
00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:06.530
You can't go back at that point, right?

16
00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:11.040
Come again at my place

17
00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.420
In this way, it will be delivered to the intersection in front of the four seasons.

18
00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:18.020
Then Bai Shu will send me back to the company.

19
00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:20.760
Why do you want to keep following me longer?

20
00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:23.090
Then guess

21
00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.270
do you really know

22
00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.510
I'll pretend

23
00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:37.830
Just live broadcast

24
00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:39.110
I still didn't go

25
00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:40.530
Just go back
