00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.730
Are you waiting for my house?

2
00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:04.170
Sometimes what you see with your own eyes may not mean what you say,

3
00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:07.610
Now it’s called one of the famous places. You young gentlemen are so close to each other.

4
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:10.210
Not much more.

5
00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.740
Sister, please do this well.

6
00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:14.960
Who doesn't have a name, it suits me so well.

7
00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:19.100
Okay, then your name seems to have a lot of words,

8
00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:20.120
Not wrong.

9
00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:26.490
Once the eyes are there, the practice belongs to whom.

10
00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:29.850
No matter who it is, you must have said something,

11
00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:34.110
He wants to wear your clothes for a year. Yeah?

12
00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.260
But it really has style

13
00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.330
But what about you?

14
00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:39.730
But if he sings, I will die

15
00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.050
And it's not a good death either

16
00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:43.550
Because he went home

17
00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:45.570
I just speculated on the relationship between me and my father.

18
00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:50.630
Besides, he hurt my mother and there’s nothing we can do about it.

19
00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.050
you promise me

20
00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.160
Is there anyone I hate?

21
00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.720
Let's go out by ourselves

22
00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:57.760
I will approve him again for you

23
00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:59.210
Let it go

24
00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:06.030
It’s too shameful for someone to eat you, miss.

25
00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.390
No accident, right?

26
00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:09.380
It's you who caused the accident, right?
