00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.800
Mouth!

2
00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:03.880
Do you know why my family drinks my hot water?

3
00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:05.880
But Ali went out of his way to exaggerate.

4
00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:08.780
Knowing that you misunderstood him, I went to the mall to buy ingredients.

5
00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:12.100
I'm going to boil hot water for you to drink, and then you can eat this meal with him.

6
00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.840
Am I you? Four, five, five meters,

7
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:17.880
There are many exits, and you act like you are following everyone's rules.

8
00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.700
Packing up after walking alone for many years

9
00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:21.120
My dogs have to go

10
00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:23.490
Go inside your dog’s old house

11
00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:24.910
Enter three slices

12
00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:27.000
I'll show you the word c

13
00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:33.500
Introducing the pocket money that is about to change in the new year.

14
00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:41.120
This is the representative

15
00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:45.350
Never mind this game

16
00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:46.730
I don’t want to prepare some sugar water

17
00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:47.870
Can I change it? How can I change it?

18
00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.560
Is this a misunderstanding now?

19
00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:50.740
You don't have to do this

20
00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:52.360
I'll just take a look at the distribution.

21
00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:55.330
Looking forward to introducing my biggest friend

22
00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:56.390
I'll leave you alone

23
00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.970
when did you

24
00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:00.170
If only you were so attentive to your parents

25
00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:04.800
There's no way it's wrong

26
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.260
Ha ha ha ha

27
00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:09.620
My friend asked me, can we all do it together?

28
00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:11.480
This family is also my aunt's best friend

29
00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:17.720
I'm a kid in my heart and I'm very poor in finances.

30
00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:21.830
You think it’s best for Auntie to be so sensible
