00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.220
There was a fuss over the meal, did you hear it?

2
00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:05.820
This person can't look at my money.

3
00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:08.400
He looked at Gongzi again,

4
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.800
Are you stupid enough to look at him again? Such six thousand,

5
00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:13.160
Don’t you admit it? Do you want to kill me?

6
00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:15.300
you disappoint me so much,

7
00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:17.120
I will be pregnant with you tomorrow and you are disappointed,

8
00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:18.740
you are disappointed,

9
00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.980
You are disappointed, you are disappointed, you are disappointed, you are disappointed, you are disappointed,

10
00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.740
You are disappointed, you are disappointed, you are disappointed,

11
00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:24.700
You are disappointed, you are disappointed,

12
00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:26.880
You are disappointed, you are disappointed, you are disappointed, you are disappointed, you are disappointed,

13
00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:30.280
You are disappointed, you are disappointed,

14
00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:33.460
You are disappointed, you are disappointed, you are disappointed,

15
00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:34.580
You are disappointed, you are disappointed, you are disappointed, you are disappointed, you are disappointed, you are disappointed, you are disappointed, you are disappointed

16
00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:36.120
I'll come and apologize to you today

17
00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:40.160
You said it was the way of heaven? Is it true?

18
00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:41.530
Your dad heard it

19
00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:43.790
You really have to do it

20
00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.180
I don't even dare to drive him to your house anymore

21
00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:53.040
Dad Dad said yes

22
00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:02.500
Where did you go back to Aria?

23
00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.519
Dad is helpless

24
00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:05.980
He was the one who kept you hurt

25
00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.430
Dad, you don’t have to kill him

26
00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:11.830
I believe sister

27
00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:14.840
He shouldn't be interested in you

28
00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:24.660
Do you want to be so sensible? Yes, yes

29
00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:28.060
This is the cleaning of Liancheng’s last public sale

30
00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:32.350
Things are going on with the Ministry of Ecology recently, okay?

31
00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:34.440
You go out and pass three or three stars

32
00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.120
see something new

33
00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:37.340
Just buy him

34
00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.960
I feel relieved and feel good
