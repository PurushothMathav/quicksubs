00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:04.960
Isn't this just a waist-flavored and warm chicken flavor?

2
00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:06.560
Why does the waist taste so bad?

3
00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:08.150
How old are you?

4
00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:11.750
How come it happened so quickly?

5
00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:18.030
That one is very clear, there is a clear episode

6
00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:21.460
It's so good to put on the cock again

7
00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:22.830
One day, did you guess who was pretending to be a chicken?

8
00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:26.480
Letâ€™s give it to me

9
00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:29.850
Not like us

10
00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:30.930
What am I looking at that girl?

11
00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:38.320
I'll just pretend to be a graduate for a while.

12
00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:39.580
I just saw you when I was going out

13
00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:42.030
If I misunderstand someone, say

14
00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:42.900
I didn't take care of it

15
00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:47.660
Here's a little second

16
00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:49.720
But you have such a good relationship with Zhuangjia

17
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.240
We are both poor and beautiful.

18
00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:54.020
Think about the conditions for decorating your home

19
00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:55.120
My eyes want it too

20
00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:57.270
The happiness of a poor girl wearing clothes

21
00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:01.640
But everyone is resisting you. Why are you pretending to be beautiful?

22
00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.760
I'm afraid I'll lose again

23
00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:07.320
Let us be attentive

24
00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.650
Isn't it a threat that light bubbles can do?

25
00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.490
Why do you really say it's so good?

26
00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:19.350
He also called you handsome for a while

27
00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:20.110
where are you going

28
00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:21.030
You don't have to worry about me

29
00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.430
I'm looking for you. You need to go somewhere else.

30
00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:25.660
You haven't given me the contact help yet?

31
00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:26.840
You passed me

32
00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:27.860
How could I have gone there?

33
00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:32.660
You passed that you

34
00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:33.880
You go up, go, go, go, go
