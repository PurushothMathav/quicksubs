00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.400
Like my funds are over-locked, how can it be like my funds are over-locked?

2
00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:07.270
I didn't go to the company's finances yesterday and I transferred them one by one. Is it like the funds have been locked?

3
00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:11.250
We transferred each other one by one,

4
00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:12.950
What? They didnâ€™t turn away,

5
00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.570
I put a pillow lock on me, why should I do it here?

6
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:31.300
It's good to have a way

7
00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:37.710
It is often said that they have succeeded in taking care of themselves.

8
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:39.800
We are in a temporary position

9
00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:41.530
Let me report it and you can report it yourself

10
00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:42.810
How could such a task happen?

11
00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.350
To eat or not to eat

12
00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:49.790
Such a young lady will come out and go up

13
00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:51.570
Otherwise, there would be nothing wrong and we would still treat people the same way.

14
00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.670
What do you usually eat inside yourself?

15
00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:57.420
It's your woman

16
00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:05.010
You can still eat but there is nothing you can do about it, Mr. Meng

17
00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.410
real horse social cent

18
00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:07.930
Relatively abandoned it

19
00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:10.760
Transfer to the driver of this project

20
00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.480
You can still try it

21
00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:13.020
Also told you
