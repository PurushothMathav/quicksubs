00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:03.300
Habits, what’s left?

2
00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:04.760
I'm getting married.

3
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:08.020
Well, are you going to be forced to get married today?

4
00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:10.140
That's right, my mother's and baby's phone calls.

5
00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:12.880
Your brother, I’ll lend it to you. You’ve already bought it.

6
00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:13.760
Also cut.

7
00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.200
The latest style of Windy Heart.

8
00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:18.200
Oh my god, I have a cold heart.

9
00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:21.520
I heard that this was no excuse for being the first in the world to pass the test in one week.

10
00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:24.640
I encountered Fengshanzhidao, and the global line wanted to save my life.

11
00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:26.100
You can buy it with money.

12
00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:28.440
You are too old to buy it.

13
00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.280
Then congratulations first.

14
00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:33.120
I want to be your wife later

15
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:34.860
You are nothing like a village girl

16
00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.940
I won't be stepped on or kicked by you, right?

17
00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:39.080
It turns out that I really look like you

18
00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:40.540
You are useless to me now

19
00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:43.350
Now I always feel that you are a super adult

20
00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:45.750
It would be nice to find the second best among young people.

21
00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:46.570
you are still satisfied

22
00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:48.230
Then your half year and a half

23
00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:49.630
Do you know if we count?

24
00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:52.500
It’s not that I hope I won’t be a young man.

25
00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:55.990
If I could follow the team on the Internet, I would do the same

26
00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:56.990
That's pretty good too

27
00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:59.290
Of course there is

28
00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:00.610
I'll get married then

29
00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:03.690
You have to tell me this for half a year, okay?

30
00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:07.770
That day I chose to leave it to you and I will remember it

31
00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.150
Everything is more than half

32
00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:10.590
then then

33
00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:20.650
Is it not normal for me to check prices every day?

34
00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:25.560
don't want to give it to you

35
00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:26.160
Since Jedi

36
00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.000
It's better to be

37
00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:44.490
What does it mean to miss my sister?
