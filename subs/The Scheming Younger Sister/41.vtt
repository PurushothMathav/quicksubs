00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.060
I remember seeing someone smiling so hard.

2
00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:08.080
I want to think of it looking like this.

3
00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:12.210
Okay, I must tell Dad about this.

4
00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:14.510
I can't say that there are no serious illnesses.

5
00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:18.270
I told him what's the use, you can make you willing to jaunt.

6
00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.250
If you make a big fuss, you will go on your own.

7
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.500
My mom’s journey, my mom’s journey, my mom’s.

8
00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:28.980
I collected them all after using them.

9
00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.280
Because whatever is rectangular is considered good for oneself.

10
00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:45.000
Unfortunately, fortunately, fortunately, fortunately, fortunately, fortunately, fortunately, fortunately.

11
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.460
Lucky, lucky, lucky, lucky, lucky, lucky, lucky.

12
00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:53.300
Lucky, lucky, lucky, lucky, lucky, lucky, lucky.

13
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:54.880
Lucky, lucky, lucky, lucky, lucky.

14
00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:59.700
Lucky, lucky, lucky, lucky, lucky, lucky, lucky.

15
00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:01.260
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

16
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.709
Do you know who of me will get married?

17
00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.290
Mom, I'm sorry

18
00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:15.540
I'm taking you to rest so late at night

19
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.020
Hello, bye

20
00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:32.680
Our family will progress

21
00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.800
I want to know that you have entered the action and

22
00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.220
Send it to your mobile phone

23
00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:45.980
I'm sorry. I just lied to you in the past two days.

24
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
It's impossible for us to have any good ideas about this matter.

25
00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.550
It's not you who are dead

26
00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:55.340
It’s me who gives you a rest
