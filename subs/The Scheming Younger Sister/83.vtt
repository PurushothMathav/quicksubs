00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:05.590
You said, why do you do this to my family?

2
00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:08.500
Sorry, Duo Cai, just tell me, you go out to eat first,

3
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.950
Madam Jean, I guess I have no intention of helping you.

4
00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.570
I live to accompany people in charge,

5
00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:17.290
At their meeting,

6
00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:20.610
One of your countermeasures is to give a family member a chance to spread their influence.

7
00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.010
It must be clear enough today.

8
00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:26.560
Say no, teach the lady,

9
00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:29.660
I happen to also plan to do the outer circle part,

10
00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:31.360
And I came here to do this, my intention is.

11
00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:35.510
Today's timing is just right, so we can make things clear.

12
00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:37.260
what do you want to say

13
00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:39.190
Your daughter is pretending

14
00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:43.250
Renovation protection city decoration protection

15
00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:45.570
Protecting yourself for too long

16
00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:46.650
Behave in style

17
00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:48.170
Once again, everyone will be service-oriented

18
00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:53.070
So can my pretending son and I want to fix my dad?

19
00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.520
Today's raised Pingchen is the pretending raiser.

20
00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.340
Get the pin-mounted protection

21
00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:59.560
How much longer does the sea grow?

22
00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:01.760
It's just a one-night stand.

23
00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:05.480
If I donâ€™t tell you that the people are just pretending to speak

24
00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:06.970
Pretending to be yours

25
00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:19.410
bite back weak bite back weak bite back fat neck face

26
00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.070
This, this, this is the roof

27
00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:25.160
This is the roof

28
00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:27.960
The roof is where you go first

29
00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.160
It's my finally sweet dog fox

30
00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:35.320
Would you like to hire someone to do the roofing?

31
00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:36.960
Will you get to this, right?

32
00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:39.090
no atmosphere

33
00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:39.970
Still here

34
00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:40.850
It came down here

35
00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:42.480
The roof is the roof

36
00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:42.780
This is looking for someone on the roof

37
00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:43.740
And the roof

38
00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.500
The roof is the roof is the roof

39
00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:48.500
It's the roof, it's the roof

40
00:01:48.970 --> 00:02:00.650
It's the roof, it's the roof, it's the roof

41
00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:00.850
The roof is the roof is the roof is the roof

42
00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:06.040
Once solved, there will be no end to the apology.

43
00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.820
That is, who should I fight with?
