00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:22.110
What? What? What? What?

2
00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:24.860
Cut it out and tell me with your own mouth

3
00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:29.550
Although the enemy is ahead, eh

4
00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.050
There’s no way I can’t do it without showing off my temper.

5
00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:32.830
The more impulsive you are

6
00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:34.850
I had no choice but to be established

7
00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:37.840
Just be what you become

8
00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:41.330
She won't go first

9
00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:42.390
I don’t want to help the makeup girl

10
00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.030
Just thinking about establishing a woman

11
00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:45.650
I feel very sad

12
00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:49.400
Very casual

13
00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:51.170
Those who achieve great things

14
00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:52.550
I'm just thinking

15
00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:55.040
You must never make trouble anymore

16
00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:57.470
Waiting for my mother, I have no plan to make a fortune

17
00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:03.630
Why are you so noisy? Mom, right?

18
00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.160
Today, since my mother has grown up

19
00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:08.850
It's this rich guy

20
00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:09.990
always america

21
00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.870
That mother only loves others and throws away a few

22
00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:14.820
But I also want to steal a liar from her.

23
00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.460
I can’t release anything.

24
00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:20.660
But the most important thing for an actor is

25
00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:23.940
What kind of tools do we have to face?

26
00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:31.190
Right?

27
00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:33.270
The person whose name is this really gives you a gift

28
00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:34.350
You will be crazy tomorrow

29
00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:35.930
will be at auction

30
00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:39.030
Give yourself time to be happy while doing it

31
00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.170
both of you

32
00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.470
You don't take the exam either

33
00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:43.640
Mom is looking for some temperament

34
00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:50.500
It's because you don't like to spend your life.

35
00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:53.930
It's you who decorates the country who asks about it

36
00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:57.690
will you go with us
