00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.600
Really, it's only been a few months

2
00:00:02.666 --> 00:00:04.466
This is not allowed to eat, and that is not allowed to dry.

3
00:00:04.466 --> 00:00:05.366
Let it go

4
00:00:05.533 --> 00:00:07.866
Miss, eat less

5
00:00:07.866 --> 00:00:09.733
You forgot Concubine Shu's plan before

6
00:00:09.733 --> 00:00:11.366
Your Majesty, this is also for your own good

7
00:00:11.366 --> 00:00:13.666
However, Concubine Shu's cakes are really delicious

8
00:00:13.666 --> 00:00:14.933
Now this one.

9
00:00:14.933 --> 00:00:15.800
Can't compare

10
00:00:17.266 --> 00:00:20.033
Your Majesty, why are you here?

11
00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:23.266
Don't eat it, be careful of choking

12
00:00:24.533 --> 00:00:25.966
How many times have I told you?

13
00:00:25.966 --> 00:00:27.666
Don't be greedy don't be greedy

14
00:00:27.666 --> 00:00:28.966
Why don't you listen?

15
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.966
Green dill take this pastry away

16
00:00:31.966 --> 00:00:33.866
Don't feed it to the queen again

17
00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.233
The emperor has said it's alright

18
00:00:39.333 --> 00:00:40.266
Have some pastries

19
00:00:40.266 --> 00:00:42.000
The emperor said that he was afraid that the fetal egg would be difficult to deliver

20
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.433
Go out for a walk

21
00:00:43.466 --> 00:00:45.300
The emperor said that he was afraid of getting cold

22
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.566
I can only walk around in this yard, no problem

23
00:00:47.566 --> 00:00:48.833
It's all a problem

24
00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:52.966
I only care about you

25
00:00:53.966 --> 00:00:55.066
And him

26
00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.666
I'm afraid in the eyes of the emperor

27
00:00:58.666 --> 00:01:00.066
Just him.

28
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.700
In my opinion, Your Majesty, you are too idle

29
00:01:03.766 --> 00:01:04.900
Your Majesty, look

30
00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.700
I have a big belly

31
00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.466
It is also impossible to serve the emperor

32
00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.633
Why don't I arrange a draft?

33
00:01:13.366 --> 00:01:16.466
I heard that the daughter of the Minister of Nursing's family is on her way

34
00:01:16.566 --> 00:01:18.100
Why don't you bring him into the palace?

35
00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:19.566
It is also good to serve the emperor

36
00:01:19.566 --> 00:01:22.266
Lest the emperor run to me every day

37
00:01:22.266 --> 00:01:23.800
Ask the emperor not to refuse?

38
00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:25.500
Don't, don't

39
00:01:25.733 --> 00:01:27.966
I'm running here now

40
00:01:27.966 --> 00:01:29.300
I think it's fine.

41
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.133
Don't schedule any more drafts

42
00:01:31.133 --> 00:01:32.833
But I heard

43
00:01:32.866 --> 00:01:34.266
Forget about the daughter of the scribe

44
00:01:34.266 --> 00:01:36.466
It looks like a flower

45
00:01:36.466 --> 00:01:37.533
slim

46
00:01:37.533 --> 00:01:39.366
Maybe the emperor will like it

47
00:01:40.066 --> 00:01:41.766
I still have some official business to attend to

48
00:01:41.766 --> 00:01:42.766
Just go first

49
00:01:42.766 --> 00:01:43.800
You have a good rest

50
00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.200
Have a good rest.

51
00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.033
Well, then send it to the emperor
