1
00:00:00.533 --> 00:00:03.166
The emperor said he fainted and fainted

2
00:00:03.166 --> 00:00:04.766
No one is in charge yet

3
00:00:04.766 --> 00:00:06.233
How do you do that?

4
00:00:06.266 --> 00:00:07.966
I'm so anxious.

5
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:09.900
The emperor not only did not set up a prince

6
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.566
Not even half of the purple is left

7
00:00:11.566 --> 00:00:13.466
In case there are three long and two short

8
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.366
Who will this great country be left to?

9
00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:17.800
Don't talk nonsense

10
00:00:17.866 --> 00:00:19.666
Even if something goes wrong

11
00:00:19.666 --> 00:00:22.433
Isn't there another His Highness in this palace?

12
00:00:22.466 --> 00:00:24.833
Another Your Highness said it well

13
00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:30.800
His Royal Brother bestowed His Royal Highness King Shuo, who met with evil and turned good luck

14
00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:33.000
I heard today that the emperor fainted

15
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.766
No news yet.

16
00:00:34.766 --> 00:00:36.666
I'm afraid by then

17
00:00:36.666 --> 00:00:38.566
Please also ask His Royal Highness King Shuo for the sake of the country

18
00:00:38.566 --> 00:00:40.166
Design to manage the big picture

19
00:00:40.166 --> 00:00:41.500
Hugh's gibberish

20
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.300
The emperor's auspicious person has his own heaven

21
00:00:43.533 --> 00:00:44.466
It will be fine.

22
00:00:44.466 --> 00:00:45.600
It's the Wei Chen oath

23
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.733
Please forgive me, His Highness King Shuo

24
00:00:47.733 --> 00:00:49.266
Let the king go in and have a look

25
00:00:53.333 --> 00:00:54.266
The emperor is favorable

26
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.900
No one is allowed inside

27
00:00:56.066 --> 00:00:58.633
How dare you stop this king
