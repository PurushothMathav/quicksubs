1
00:00:00.533 --> 00:00:02.500
Then let this king tell you

2
00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:05.266
What will happen when you die?

3
00:00:05.266 --> 00:00:08.566
First of all, my men stationed in the suburbs of Beijing

4
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:10.533
Will control the entire capital

5
00:00:10.533 --> 00:00:14.566
Then there will be a decree announced to the world

6
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:17.900
This king is the most suitable royal heir

7
00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.300
Then I will become the new emperor

8
00:00:21.666 --> 00:00:22.866
Hahahaha

9
00:00:22.866 --> 00:00:25.200
What I can't get from you

10
00:00:25.366 --> 00:00:28.933
Shuo, I can give it to me, you just plan

11
00:00:28.933 --> 00:00:31.000
You just rebel

12
00:00:34.066 --> 00:00:36.100
You're a dying man now.

13
00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.566
What right do you have to accuse me, the future emperor?

14
00:00:38.566 --> 00:00:40.900
Emperor, hahahaha.

15
00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:41.700
Oh.

16
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.066
Refund Concubine Yuan Guifei in your cold palace

17
00:00:45.066 --> 00:00:47.700
The king will let him give birth to the child

18
00:00:47.766 --> 00:00:49.500
If he disobeys the king

19
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.500
The king will kill his children in front of him

20
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.600
If he is obedient and supports this king well

21
00:00:55.666 --> 00:00:57.433
The king can consider

22
00:00:57.466 --> 00:01:00.266
Without killing his children in front of him

23
00:01:00.466 --> 00:01:02.100
Hahahaha

24
00:01:02.533 --> 00:01:03.700
Don't look like that

25
00:01:04.166 --> 00:01:06.966
The king will definitely do what he says

26
00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.400
I still understand the principle of cutting weeds and eradicating roots

27
00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.966
No, I treat you well on weekdays

28
00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.800
Why are you treating me well?

29
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.633
Everything is yours since childhood

30
00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.300
You won't give it to me until you don't want it.

31
00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.000
I don't like riding horses

32
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.866
You and your father forced me to ride a horse

33
00:01:25.866 --> 00:01:28.666
You never cared what I wanted.
