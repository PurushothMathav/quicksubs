00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:01.333
Usually one is smarter than the other

2
00:00:01.333 --> 00:00:03.066
It's all hoarse at the critical moment

3
00:00:03.066 --> 00:00:05.033
Go out, I just want to go in alone

4
00:00:05.133 --> 00:00:07.700
Yes yes emperor

5
00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:09.533
Chen's mother is sick and needs care

6
00:00:09.533 --> 00:00:11.300
Ask the emperor to speak for Chen Santian

7
00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:13.266
Turn around, turn around, thank you Emperor

8
00:00:13.366 --> 00:00:14.166
And so forth.

9
00:00:14.566 --> 00:00:15.466
What did you just say?

10
00:00:15.466 --> 00:00:17.466
Chen Jiazhong's mother is sick and needs care

11
00:00:17.466 --> 00:00:20.633
Take care of the sick

12
00:00:20.733 --> 00:00:23.300
Hahaha Emperor

13
00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:26.000
The root of the Dragon Body Kingdom is ungovernable

14
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.400
Jiangshan Society doesn't care about it

15
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:29.900
You can pretend to be sick.

16
00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.300
You're not really sick.

17
00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.200
Ouch, I fought so hard in the south and north without losing

18
00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.666
How can a little cold water make me sick?

19
00:00:38.666 --> 00:00:40.300
Coughing and runny nose at most

20
00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:41.533
If there is no such thing

21
00:00:41.533 --> 00:00:42.900
How can I make Concubine Yuan believe it?

22
00:00:44.766 --> 00:00:46.100
Emperor

23
00:00:52.133 --> 00:00:53.833
I didn't expect my body

24
00:00:53.933 --> 00:00:56.166
Can't resist the cold

25
00:00:58.866 --> 00:01:00.466
Don't tell Yuan Fei about this.

26
00:01:00.466 --> 00:01:03.366
Otherwise, you will definitely laugh at me

27
00:01:04.666 --> 00:01:06.366
The emperor has always been in good health

28
00:01:06.366 --> 00:01:08.200
I didn't expect to be so sick

29
00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.500
I have a prescription here.

30
00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.833
Press this first and give it to the emperor

31
00:01:12.933 --> 00:01:16.633
Hahaha, this heart disease has to be treated first
