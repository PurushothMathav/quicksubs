00:00:00.966 --> 00:00:02.966
Is the emperor alright?

2
00:00:02.966 --> 00:00:04.833
Wasn't it fine just now?

3
00:00:05.266 --> 00:00:07.000
The emperor's body has always been healthy

4
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.700
Why did you suddenly fall ill?

5
00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.666
I'm afraid I won't hide for ten days

6
00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:19.300
Or ask you to do one thing for me?

7
00:00:19.566 --> 00:00:22.633
Concubine Leng Gong Yuan has an adopted son in her womb

8
00:00:22.933 --> 00:00:24.466
I can't get to the right

9
00:00:24.933 --> 00:00:28.200
Please also force him to be the queen

10
00:00:28.533 --> 00:00:30.466
Do your best to assist his son

11
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:31.700
Valley of Evan

12
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.033
Jiangshan design left by ancestors

13
00:00:35.766 --> 00:00:37.600
Hahahahaha

14
00:00:38.133 --> 00:00:39.566
I didn't expect it.

15
00:00:39.733 --> 00:00:42.566
It would rather be passed on to an unborn fetus

16
00:00:42.566 --> 00:00:44.866
I don't want to pass on the throne to this king

17
00:00:45.266 --> 00:00:46.600
Design for Jiangshan

18
00:00:46.733 --> 00:00:48.400
Isn't this king more suitable?

19
00:00:48.533 --> 00:00:50.866
I didn't expect you to die

20
00:00:50.866 --> 00:00:52.900
Will make him the queen

21
00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.966
Why can't it be me?

22
00:00:54.966 --> 00:00:57.100
I am your savior

23
00:00:59.566 --> 00:01:00.700
you
