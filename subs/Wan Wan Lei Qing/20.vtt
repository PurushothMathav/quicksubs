1
00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.866
Someone will take Yuan Pinghe, the maid, into the dungeon

2
00:00:05.366 --> 00:00:06.933
The situation has not been found out yet.

3
00:00:06.933 --> 00:00:08.233
How can this be?

4
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:09.700
Let's hear what Yuan Pin has to say first

5
00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:12.366
Return to the emperor An Noble is in the garden

6
00:00:12.366 --> 00:00:13.733
In public

7
00:00:13.733 --> 00:00:16.033
Blatantly slander the concubine as a little bitch

8
00:00:16.366 --> 00:00:18.766
The concubine is Yuan Pin personally sealed by the emperor

9
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.000
An Guiren is so contemptuous of imperial power

10
00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.833
The concubine punished him for kneeling for an hour according to the palace rules

11
00:00:24.933 --> 00:00:27.533
What is this?

12
00:00:27.533 --> 00:00:29.000
An Guiren has not yet fallen

13
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.100
That bracelet

14
00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:33.700
But the old slave found a craftsman to add musk

15
00:00:33.766 --> 00:00:35.833
Pregnancy is really stable

16
00:00:35.866 --> 00:00:37.866
I can't kill two birds with one stone

17
00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.200
It's all slaves, it's okay to be damned

18
00:00:40.366 --> 00:00:42.033
Let's count

19
00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:43.633
One less career

20
00:00:43.866 --> 00:00:46.033
An Guiren is lucky

21
00:00:46.066 --> 00:00:47.700
How important is Huang Si?

22
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.566
Even if An Guiren is wrong

23
00:00:49.566 --> 00:00:52.266
We should also talk about it after the birth of Huang Si

24
00:00:52.266 --> 00:00:53.766
Empress Hui Shu

25
00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:56.700
An Guiren was pregnant after fainting

26
00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:58.433
The imperial doctor only found out when he came

27
00:00:58.533 --> 00:01:00.566
The matter of killing the noble is true

28
00:01:00.566 --> 00:01:02.233
Otherwise it wouldn't be so

29
00:01:02.566 --> 00:01:04.166
Who knows what you have in mind?

30
00:01:04.266 --> 00:01:07.166
Maybe you knew I was pregnant

31
00:01:07.166 --> 00:01:08.733
I'm afraid I'll fade the yellow thorns

32
00:01:08.733 --> 00:01:10.066
Threaten your position

33
00:01:10.066 --> 00:01:11.800
So I did it on purpose

34
00:01:12.066 --> 00:01:14.766
How can you talk nonsense without evidence?

35
00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.800
Even imperial physicians have to check the pulse before they can determine

36
00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:21.033
Could Yuan Ping be a skilled doctor?

37
00:01:21.066 --> 00:01:22.600
Can you tell at a glance?

38
00:01:22.666 --> 00:01:26.300
The emperor's concubine sees that both sides now hold their own

39
00:01:26.666 --> 00:01:28.300
Although Yuan Ping is innocent

40
00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:31.166
But it does also harm Huang Si's body

41
00:01:31.333 --> 00:01:32.600
Force the concubine to see

42
00:01:32.733 --> 00:01:36.000
Why don't you let Yuan Ping do one thing for An Guiren?

43
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.033
How about an apology?
