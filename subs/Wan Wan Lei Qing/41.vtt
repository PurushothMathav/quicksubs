00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.066
Oh emperor

2
00:00:04.066 --> 00:00:05.533
Not in our palace

3
00:00:05.533 --> 00:00:08.533
A big brother who is from the same hometown as the Empress just came.

4
00:00:08.533 --> 00:00:09.333
Kitchen?

5
00:00:09.333 --> 00:00:11.966
I might as well call him here

6
00:00:11.966 --> 00:00:14.900
Show off your cooking skills in front of the empress

7
00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:16.066
Maybe.

8
00:00:16.066 --> 00:00:19.700
Can the emperor have dinner with the empress?

9
00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:22.366
Good idea is trusting you one last time

10
00:00:28.166 --> 00:00:29.666
Miss, can you smell it?

11
00:00:29.666 --> 00:00:32.366
This is the taste of our authentic hometown cuisine

12
00:00:36.366 --> 00:00:38.533
The cook specially invited by my concubine

13
00:00:38.533 --> 00:00:40.500
Made a table of hometown dishes that my concubine loves to eat

14
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.400
Do you want to go on a mountain tour together?

15
00:00:42.666 --> 00:00:43.566
Why are you looking for me?

16
00:00:43.566 --> 00:00:45.233
Go find the person in your portrait

17
00:00:46.133 --> 00:00:49.000
The people in this portrait can't eat either

18
00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:51.100
concubine

19
00:00:51.666 --> 00:00:52.633
You are a forgiver

20
00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.866
Make a few more dishes for the Empress

21
00:00:55.866 --> 00:00:58.266
Just leave the cook here

22
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.333
Look at you looking so useless

23
00:01:02.333 --> 00:01:04.566
Eat slowly, no one will rob you.

24
00:01:04.566 --> 00:01:05.533
Eat slowly

25
00:01:05.533 --> 00:01:08.566
I'm going to pack up. Hmm?

26
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.800
Empress, are you alright?
