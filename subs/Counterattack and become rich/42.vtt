00:00:12.866 --> 00:00:15.200
You came just in time

2
00:00:15.866 --> 00:00:18.100
Help me see which of the two paintings is more pleasing to the eye

3
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.333
Yes, Brother Kobayashi

4
00:00:24.333 --> 00:00:25.500
You still have this craft

5
00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.566
And you can support your family with that.

6
00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:32.633
Oh, I feel that too.

7
00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.000
It's a little hard for me to choose

8
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.433
What are you doing?

9
00:00:36.533 --> 00:00:39.433
Selling money is the mountain standard of our villa

10
00:00:39.766 --> 00:00:43.100
When you see these logos printed out

11
00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.233
Stick to our gift bags including compressors

12
00:00:45.466 --> 00:00:47.966
Just wait for the logo printed with these patterns

13
00:00:48.266 --> 00:00:49.400
The box is ready and packed.

14
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.600
Our jewelry can be sold normally.

15
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.200
It can be sold so soon.

16
00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:54.466
A little strange

17
00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.166
Products also need to be tested when they go on the market.

18
00:00:58.333 --> 00:01:00.366
But our camellia is wild.

19
00:01:00.366 --> 00:01:02.566
Zero pollution should be fine.

20
00:01:02.766 --> 00:01:04.800
By the way, how is the acquisition of camellia?

21
00:01:05.266 --> 00:01:07.533
Already around 1,100 kilograms

22
00:01:07.533 --> 00:01:10.766
That's okay. Are you ready to send some goods to the county seat?

23
00:01:10.766 --> 00:01:12.333
Then wait for our funds to come back.

24
00:01:12.333 --> 00:01:13.766
Register your own trademark

25
00:01:14.333 --> 00:01:16.300
Hey, I'll be busy by then

26
00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:17.766
Then I'll go get ready first

27
00:01:17.933 --> 00:01:19.100
You're not the only one preparing

28
00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:20.833
And it also requires momentum for everyone to prepare.

29
00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:21.966
Just these packages

30
00:01:21.966 --> 00:01:25.100
Customer service, delivery, etc., requires a lot of manpower.

31
00:01:25.333 --> 00:01:28.300
And I'm going to make Li Ming the spokesperson too.

32
00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:30.166
Okay, bro, even thought of this

33
00:01:30.166 --> 00:01:31.200
A huge plan

34
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.566
It was already formed in my mind

35
00:01:32.566 --> 00:01:34.266
As long as we go step by step

36
00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:35.866
Sure no problem

37
00:01:36.266 --> 00:01:39.100
Well, then I'll go and ship it to the mall.

38
00:01:39.266 --> 00:01:41.033
Lay out our goods early.

39
00:01:41.133 --> 00:01:42.633
Launch our brand early
