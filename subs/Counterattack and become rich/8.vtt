00:00:00.566 --> 00:00:01.366
Ji Jialin

2
00:00:02.066 --> 00:00:03.266
You come out

3
00:00:06.333 --> 00:00:07.233
Second time

4
00:00:08.366 --> 00:00:10.700
How dare you make fun of me?

5
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.500
When did I make fun of you? You returned the marriage yourself.

6
00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:15.366
What happened to Li Mingyue?

7
00:00:15.366 --> 00:00:18.500
What happened to Li Xiujiang who left just now?

8
00:00:18.933 --> 00:00:20.266
That's my business.

9
00:00:20.266 --> 00:00:21.466
It has nothing to do with you.

10
00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:26.733
Let bygones be bygones.

11
00:00:26.733 --> 00:00:29.200
From now on, there will be no connection between you and me

12
00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.933
Are you gutsy?

13
00:00:32.933 --> 00:00:35.466
How dare you talk to me like that?

14
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.400
Okay, I won't talk nonsense with you either.

15
00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:42.900
Did you forget something?

16
00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.433
What my banquet love

17
00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.066
I didn't eat a bite of your food

18
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.700
Li Xiaoli, you know I'm trying to marry you

19
00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.200
How many calls were made?

20
00:00:54.266 --> 00:00:55.566
How many gold coins were issued?

21
00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:57.233
Which one doesn't want to spend money on?

22
00:00:59.666 --> 00:01:01.900
Oops, you give me 30,000 bucks

23
00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:03.566
Our two-step blind date

24
00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.833
I'll go right now

25
00:01:06.333 --> 00:01:08.500
Whether you spend money or not is your own business.

26
00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:09.766
It has nothing to do with me.

27
00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.000
When will this guy dare to call me him?

28
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.800
Who gave him the courage?

29
00:01:15.966 --> 00:01:18.566
Are you a fan? Are you okay?

30
00:01:18.566 --> 00:01:19.766
It's okay to leave
