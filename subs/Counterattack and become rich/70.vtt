00:00:00.933 --> 00:00:02.266
This road is blocked

2
00:00:02.566 --> 00:00:03.600
What is this?

3
00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:05.100
We paid

4
00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:06.266
It's not that I didn't pay

5
00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.033
I'll say it again.

6
00:00:08.166 --> 00:00:11.000
This mountain starts now

7
00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.033
Not a single leaf is missing

8
00:00:13.366 --> 00:00:15.533
Oops, if you don't take off this tea leaves

9
00:00:15.533 --> 00:00:16.900
It will turn into old leaves in a few days

10
00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:18.266
Can't make tea

11
00:00:18.666 --> 00:00:20.433
It's none of our business.

12
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.466
I really can't, we'll give you more money.

13
00:00:23.466 --> 00:00:24.600
That's okay, right?

14
00:00:24.766 --> 00:00:26.600
It's not about the money at all.

15
00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.833
It is you who enter the mountain every day

16
00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:30.533
Earn so much

17
00:00:30.533 --> 00:00:32.300
Li Xiaolin earns more

18
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.200
My brothers only earn a little bit of entrance fee

19
00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.466
Does that sound like a word?

20
00:00:37.466 --> 00:00:38.666
Like a word

21
00:00:39.566 --> 00:00:41.766
Oops, that really doesn't work.

22
00:00:41.766 --> 00:00:43.766
If it really doesn't work, I can only find Li Xiaolin to find a way

23
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.800
Stop using Li Xiaolin to scare me

24
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:46.766
I'll tell you what.

25
00:00:46.766 --> 00:00:48.433
Aren't you afraid of me?

26
00:00:49.733 --> 00:00:51.966
Xiaolin, are you at home?

27
00:00:51.966 --> 00:00:53.466
Hey, sister-in-law, oops.

28
00:00:55.566 --> 00:00:59.100
The Wang Decheng brothers blocked the entrance to the mountain

29
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.566
Don't let people into the mountains to pick tea

30
00:01:00.566 --> 00:01:02.066
It's useless anyway

31
00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.600
I can only come to you

32
00:01:03.733 --> 00:01:05.633
Oops go

33
00:01:06.566 --> 00:01:08.633
Go up oops

34
00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:13.166
What do you want?

35
00:01:13.733 --> 00:01:16.366
How about not wanting what?

36
00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.366
I just don't want you to come into the mountains

37
00:01:19.366 --> 00:01:20.566
You can hit me

38
00:01:21.066 --> 00:01:22.166
You can also kill me

39
00:01:22.866 --> 00:01:25.566
But as long as it doesn't kill me

40
00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.600
I'll give you a fire in the evening

41
00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:30.566
Oh, right.

42
00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.133
Kill our brothers

43
00:01:32.133 --> 00:01:35.766
These three songs are yours.
