00:00:00.566 --> 00:00:03.233
Hahahaha

2
00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:06.466
Brother Hai, why are you lying on the ground?

3
00:00:06.466 --> 00:00:08.666
Are you doing performance art?

4
00:00:09.533 --> 00:00:12.100
Brother Hai, why are you crying?

5
00:00:12.733 --> 00:00:13.533
Could it be that

6
00:00:14.166 --> 00:00:15.266
Oh, no.

7
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.366
Why would someone dare to hit Brother Hai in our village?

8
00:00:21.366 --> 00:00:23.266
I think these people don't want to live anymore

9
00:00:23.266 --> 00:00:25.566
Who did Brother Hai tell his brother?

10
00:00:25.666 --> 00:00:27.900
I'll clean them up one by one for you another day.

11
00:00:28.333 --> 00:00:29.566
You two

12
00:00:29.966 --> 00:00:34.100
Can you put me up first?

13
00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.000
Brother Hai, who did you say hit?

14
00:00:41.766 --> 00:00:43.966
Li Xiaolin what?

15
00:00:44.533 --> 00:00:46.200
He dares to hit

16
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.166
Brother Hai, I think he ate bear fairy leopard gall

17
00:00:49.566 --> 00:00:51.366
This is not daring

18
00:00:51.366 --> 00:00:52.800
The question of whether to eat or not

19
00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.466
It's this Lin Xiaolin, he's a piece of crap

20
00:00:55.533 --> 00:00:58.966
He can single-handedly cross a little finger of Brother Hai

21
00:00:59.966 --> 00:01:00.766
Hello

22
00:01:01.266 --> 00:01:02.066
Kaige

23
00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.000
Did you find a new porcelain touch point?

24
00:01:07.066 --> 00:01:08.633
You touch your touch you touch your

25
00:01:08.766 --> 00:01:10.400
I'll let you bite and beat you

26
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:13.600
You two

27
00:01:14.066 --> 00:01:15.100
Now in the past

28
00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:16.166
Beat him up

29
00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:18.000
come out

30
00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:20.233
I am responsible for

31
00:01:21.566 --> 00:01:25.500
Okay, if Brother Hai speaks, then I won't hold back

32
00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:26.800
Hai Ge

33
00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:28.933
You just wait here.

34
00:01:28.933 --> 00:01:31.500
We brothers take this breath for you

35
00:01:36.466 --> 00:01:39.200
Can't you be lighter?
