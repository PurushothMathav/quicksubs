00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:03.766
Kobayashi 600,000 a month

2
00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:05.366
I dare not dream of doing this

3
00:00:05.366 --> 00:00:07.033
Are people forced out?

4
00:00:07.933 --> 00:00:10.266
It's all my fault if things get done

5
00:00:10.266 --> 00:00:11.166
If the funds are returned

6
00:00:11.166 --> 00:00:12.633
It won't be as easy as it is now

7
00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:15.066
You're not in the neck position.

8
00:00:15.066 --> 00:00:17.600
It's very heavy, how can you erupt talent?

9
00:00:17.766 --> 00:00:19.000
So what are you going to do now?

10
00:00:19.333 --> 00:00:20.133
The plan remains unchanged

11
00:00:20.133 --> 00:00:21.233
Urgent need for tea picking

12
00:00:21.666 --> 00:00:22.866
Put the weight away

13
00:00:23.333 --> 00:00:25.000
I give every account to God

14
00:00:25.866 --> 00:00:27.300
That can only be done first

15
00:00:30.666 --> 00:00:32.500
Tea in front

16
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.400
This is our local camellia

17
00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.466
The whole country is only available to our generation

18
00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.700
And I've made a fortune off of it over the years.

19
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.566
The aftertaste is indeed very unique

20
00:00:52.766 --> 00:00:53.666
Return to strong

21
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:55.566
Even if I enjoy the official's famous tea

22
00:00:55.566 --> 00:00:57.800
I also think this is a genuine product that cannot be done.

23
00:00:58.133 --> 00:01:01.033
But now someone wants to take my profits.

24
00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:02.166
Take my hair

25
00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.066
Breaking the talent path is like murdering parents

26
00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.700
This is an irreconcilable hatred

27
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.166
That guy deserved to die.

28
00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.666
That's why I asked my seniors to testify

29
00:01:14.733 --> 00:01:15.533
who

30
00:01:16.766 --> 00:01:17.800
Go over there

31
00:01:21.266 --> 00:01:22.100
For the noble
