00:00:00.566 --> 00:00:01.366
Say a number

2
00:00:01.933 --> 00:00:03.733
It's like I'm selling my daughter

3
00:00:03.733 --> 00:00:05.133
I can't speak

4
00:00:05.133 --> 00:00:06.700
Then be direct.

5
00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:08.700
600,000 one less

6
00:00:08.966 --> 00:00:09.800
OK

7
00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:11.900
You really have 600,000

8
00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.266
I gave him the moon before 200,000

9
00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:16.733
You gave Mingyue 200,000

10
00:00:16.733 --> 00:00:19.166
That was when you were a door-to-door son-in-law

11
00:00:19.166 --> 00:00:20.400
Mingyue saved you

12
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:21.666
But he deserved it.

13
00:00:21.666 --> 00:00:23.200
The compensation you should give him

14
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:24.900
I think so.

15
00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.333
Take 200,000 as a dowry

16
00:00:26.333 --> 00:00:28.633
The rest 400,000 for both of you

17
00:00:28.866 --> 00:00:31.200
But give me a month to pay in one lump sum

18
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.633
Really stand for a sentence

19
00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.300
Standing words are not necessary

20
00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:37.133
When is the time?

21
00:00:37.133 --> 00:00:39.066
Don't even think about running away with my daughter

22
00:00:39.166 --> 00:00:41.366
My daughter was raised by me

23
00:00:41.366 --> 00:00:42.966
I finally raised a big kid

24
00:00:42.966 --> 00:00:43.933
I'm going to run away with you

25
00:00:43.933 --> 00:00:44.700
I will

26
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.866
Why don't I feed him his father to the dogs?

27
00:00:47.866 --> 00:00:49.533
Put it in the pigsty to raise

28
00:00:49.533 --> 00:00:51.066
I won't let him marry you

29
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:52.966
OK.

30
00:00:52.966 --> 00:00:53.900
You go make money

31
00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:55.200
I'm waiting for you at home.

32
00:01:02.133 --> 00:01:03.066
Oh, dear.

33
00:01:03.166 --> 00:01:05.800
Now our village earns 50,000 a year

34
00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:07.200
Those are all experts

35
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.566
You see it this way

36
00:01:08.566 --> 00:01:10.666
Isn't this forcing Kobayashi to the ninth road?

37
00:01:10.666 --> 00:01:12.366
You're the only peacemaker

38
00:01:12.366 --> 00:01:13.066
Let me tell you something.

39
00:01:13.066 --> 00:01:14.833
Even if what I want to give has nothing to do with me

40
00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.233
You you oops
