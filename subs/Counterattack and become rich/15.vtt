00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:02.366
Don't move, don't move, you lose

2
00:00:02.366 --> 00:00:03.433
Senior

3
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Is that you, senior?

4
00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:07.633
It's me, you didn't open the card

5
00:00:07.733 --> 00:00:09.466
The opponent has changed the cards

6
00:00:09.533 --> 00:00:11.800
Open now and you'll only lose everything

7
00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:13.700
I'm always trying to please

8
00:00:14.333 --> 00:00:16.500
Why didn't you see him change the cards?

9
00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:18.033
Logically speaking

10
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.700
He can't be faster than me

11
00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.033
His thousands have been perfected

12
00:00:23.166 --> 00:00:25.100
And there are traps all over the table.

13
00:00:25.333 --> 00:00:27.366
You couldn't have counted on him at all

14
00:00:28.133 --> 00:00:29.833
So what should I do now?

15
00:00:30.533 --> 00:00:32.266
I kick you to the 13th guard of the ghost gate

16
00:00:32.966 --> 00:00:34.600
You will understand

17
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.966
Do you still want to pray?

18
00:00:46.166 --> 00:00:47.766
I just suddenly remembered

19
00:00:47.766 --> 00:00:51.366
What should I do if you lose and don't admit it?

20
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.800
I can't beat you now

21
00:00:55.133 --> 00:00:56.233
Is there any way?

22
00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.066
That's true!

23
00:00:58.066 --> 00:01:01.233
Wait until your three golden houses and land are dead

24
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:02.266
In the village

25
00:01:02.366 --> 00:01:06.600
I can only wash it if I can't get along, and I'm obsessed with being beaten by you

26
00:01:07.566 --> 00:01:08.600
Let's do it.

27
00:01:11.466 --> 00:01:13.633
456 Shun I won

28
00:01:15.333 --> 00:01:17.366
It's your first time playing Daijinhua

29
00:01:17.533 --> 00:01:19.466
Of course it's my three tips.

30
00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.366
The biggest, hahahaha.

31
00:01:26.566 --> 00:01:27.633
Hey.
