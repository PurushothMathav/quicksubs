00:00:00.766 --> 00:00:03.066
Master, under your guidance these years

2
00:00:03.066 --> 00:00:04.733
Unless my strength advances sharply

3
00:00:04.733 --> 00:00:05.800
After I go out

4
00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:07.266
I'm ready to break through the pantheon

5
00:00:07.366 --> 00:00:08.166
Don't call me master

6
00:00:08.166 --> 00:00:09.566
It's not even a mirror

7
00:00:09.566 --> 00:00:11.833
I'm not as stupid as you, apprentice, not master

8
00:00:11.966 --> 00:00:14.566
I am the sect master of the first God of War Longmen in the building

9
00:00:14.566 --> 00:00:16.100
You don't like me anymore

10
00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:18.366
Okay, act tough and get out

11
00:00:18.466 --> 00:00:20.400
Master, wait for me to break through the dust digging realm

12
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.266
I will officially worship you as my teacher to remove monsters

13
00:00:22.266 --> 00:00:25.266
If you don't leave, I'll give you three years to get out

14
00:00:25.266 --> 00:00:26.566
Hey, yeah, yeah.

15
00:00:26.566 --> 00:00:28.566
Go out and don't look back

16
00:00:32.966 --> 00:00:37.066
Welcome to the first God of War Longmen Sect Master of the building

17
00:00:37.166 --> 00:00:41.000
Welcome to the first God of War Longmen Sect Master of the building

18
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.900
Keep your voice down

19
00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:42.866
No noise here

20
00:00:42.866 --> 00:00:45.533
The disciple Zhao Xianyi paid a visit to the teacher Sun

21
00:00:45.533 --> 00:00:46.366
Get up

22
00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.900
Master, I didn't expect your retreat to be in such a remote small prison

23
00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:52.366
What kind of small prison is this?

24
00:00:52.533 --> 00:00:54.900
This is the most terrifying dark honor in the world

25
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.266
Almost can't get out

26
00:00:56.266 --> 00:00:58.166
Master, you have been in retreat for 3 years

27
00:00:58.166 --> 00:01:00.266
About to break through the legendary Transfiguration Mirror

28
00:01:00.266 --> 00:01:01.966
The strength must be invincible

29
00:01:01.966 --> 00:01:03.100
What invincible

30
00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:06.500
In front of my master, I can't even take his move

31
00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.100
What master

32
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.933
What a terrifying existence your master is

33
00:01:10.933 --> 00:01:13.366
I wonder if the disciple is lucky enough to gradually lose his way

34
00:01:13.366 --> 00:01:14.766
When I break through the metamorphosis mirror

35
00:01:14.766 --> 00:01:16.800
Let's talk about it after the official apprenticeship

36
00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:17.566
Go away

37
00:01:17.566 --> 00:01:18.833
Don't make noise here

38
00:01:18.866 --> 00:01:21.333
Master and apprentice still have something to do to go to the small prison

39
00:01:21.333 --> 00:01:22.866
Retire first
