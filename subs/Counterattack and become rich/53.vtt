00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:02.100
Hey, don't mind.

2
00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:03.100
That's all.

3
00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:04.800
Dishwashing is a bad thing.

4
00:00:05.333 --> 00:00:06.433
in good shape

5
00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:07.900
It's a good child.

6
00:00:08.466 --> 00:00:09.900
Oh yes

7
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.566
I just looked at his body

8
00:00:11.566 --> 00:00:12.766
But for so many years

9
00:00:13.333 --> 00:00:15.366
He didn't even give me a son and a half

10
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:19.466
It just so happens that my wife knows some imperial techniques

11
00:00:20.966 --> 00:00:22.166
Seniors always have these

12
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.000
Well, that was a windfall.

13
00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.666
The old man usually adjusts for people once every three days

14
00:00:28.733 --> 00:00:31.233
Ten consecutive conditioning has not been unsuccessful.

15
00:00:32.266 --> 00:00:35.500
Senior, you are my lucky star.

16
00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.900
It's a trivial matter

17
00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:39.466
elder brother

18
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:40.700
brother

19
00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:42.300
brother

20
00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.700
Brother, I got someone to call me

21
00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:47.100
Then why are you panicking?

22
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.366
Senior is here

23
00:00:48.466 --> 00:00:50.000
No one has to be afraid to know

24
00:00:51.333 --> 00:00:52.133
senior

25
00:00:53.933 --> 00:00:55.400
What's the matter?

26
00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:57.100
This isn't me.

27
00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.366
Listen to my brother, I'll go to Li Mingyue's house to propose marriage

28
00:00:59.533 --> 00:01:01.566
Fucking Li Xiaolei, this kid goes over

29
00:01:01.566 --> 00:01:03.466
Then he hit me

30
00:01:03.466 --> 00:01:07.500
Haha, senior is really predictable

31
00:01:07.733 --> 00:01:11.300
It only takes a few little things to overwhelm him

32
00:01:12.466 --> 00:01:14.600
Those who achieve great things are informal

33
00:01:14.866 --> 00:01:16.966
For a simple woman

34
00:01:16.966 --> 00:01:18.433
You can see the pattern.

35
00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:21.866
Senior brother

36
00:01:22.933 --> 00:01:24.400
What are you talking about?

37
00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.000
Why don't I understand?

38
00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.766
Brother, you will understand in a few days.
