00:00:02.733 --> 00:00:04.066
Tigers don't show their power

2
00:00:04.366 --> 00:00:06.400
Do you think I'm a sick cat?

3
00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:08.700
Li Xiaolin

4
00:00:09.333 --> 00:00:12.433
I know you've run out of money.

5
00:00:12.866 --> 00:00:14.966
But it doesn't matter.

6
00:00:15.166 --> 00:00:19.600
Don't you still have 3 acres of land on the east hillside?

7
00:00:19.766 --> 00:00:21.600
That's my ration field.

8
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.800
Of course I know this

9
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.766
I just want to use your ration field

10
00:00:27.933 --> 00:00:29.766
To make up for my loss

11
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:31.800
Although

12
00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:34.433
Less is less you

13
00:00:34.733 --> 00:00:38.500
But who made me kind-hearted?

14
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:39.766
You dream

15
00:00:40.466 --> 00:00:42.166
The least that land is worth 100,000

16
00:00:42.366 --> 00:00:44.866
Do you think I study less and continue to lie to me?

17
00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:49.700
You mean you're rejecting me?

18
00:00:51.666 --> 00:00:54.166
Now on the count of three.

19
00:00:54.566 --> 00:00:56.300
If you don't agree

20
00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.400
I'll call until you agree.

21
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.066
Huh?

22
00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:06.066
This Tao Haihai is a famous person in the village

23
00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.300
On the ability to fight

24
00:01:09.366 --> 00:01:10.633
Absolutely lose one lose two

25
00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:12.600
Just my little body

26
00:01:13.266 --> 00:01:15.366
Three might not be able to beat him

27
00:01:18.166 --> 00:01:19.666
That courier is very valuable.

28
00:01:20.133 --> 00:01:22.166
It's my first pot of gold to make a comeback

29
00:01:23.333 --> 00:01:24.600
Just got corrupted

30
00:01:25.133 --> 00:01:26.433
How can I be grateful?

31
00:01:27.466 --> 00:01:28.666
Really can't

32
00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.466
Then fight it out

33
00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.900
annoying

34
00:01:35.966 --> 00:01:38.833
Tell me your answer.

35
00:01:39.366 --> 00:01:40.433
No no

36
00:01:40.866 --> 00:01:42.466
Even if you make an instant move

37
00:01:43.166 --> 00:01:44.633
You can't do it, general, knock it all down

38
00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:47.666
I'm afraid it will cause crazy revenge from the other party.

39
00:01:48.566 --> 00:01:50.233
Then it really suffered

40
00:01:51.866 --> 00:01:52.700
OK

41
00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:59.566
It seems that you are toasting and not eating and being fined

42
00:02:01.066 --> 00:02:03.200
Don't be afraid boy

43
00:02:03.466 --> 00:02:06.766
I will pass on your Hundred Steps Divine Fist now
