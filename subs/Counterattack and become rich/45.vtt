00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:02.400
Master, don't worry.

2
00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:03.633
I know the rules

3
00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:05.200
What is 1,100 kilograms?

4
00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:11.500
Wait a minute.

5
00:00:20.266 --> 00:00:22.166
This is your tea

6
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.766
Damn lucky the bag rotted

7
00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:29.600
What do you ask me to explain if this is the day it leaves the warehouse?

8
00:00:30.733 --> 00:00:33.000
Impossible! That's impossible!

9
00:00:33.766 --> 00:00:34.900
From transportation to loading

10
00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:36.900
It's all arranged by myself

11
00:00:37.066 --> 00:00:39.100
I even collected the camellia myself

12
00:00:39.933 --> 00:00:42.233
How can it become a rotten leaf?

13
00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:45.100
Go, go, go

14
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.700
Lao Tzu refuses to enter the house

15
00:00:47.966 --> 00:00:49.500
Give me another chance

16
00:00:49.566 --> 00:00:50.966
Give me another hundred thousand

17
00:00:51.166 --> 00:00:53.033
I lost money, I can't explain it.

18
00:00:53.133 --> 00:00:54.366
Give me a chance.

19
00:00:54.933 --> 00:00:56.600
Who the hell gave me a chance?

20
00:00:57.166 --> 00:00:58.033
roll

21
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:10.966
Don't look at me

22
00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.600
I'm just a driver

23
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:13.866
I don't know anything.

24
00:01:17.866 --> 00:01:19.433
The tree on the road

25
00:01:20.066 --> 00:01:21.400
Do you still remember?
