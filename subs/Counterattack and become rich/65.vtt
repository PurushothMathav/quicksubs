00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:01.433
To launch Lin Defang

2
00:00:02.266 --> 00:00:05.066
Li Xiaolin Li Li Li Li Li Xiaolin

3
00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:06.600
Li Xiaolin

4
00:00:07.366 --> 00:00:08.466
What about Li Xiaolin? Li Xiaolin

5
00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:09.700
How dare you come back?

6
00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:12.333
Last time I ran a dish, I didn't see Lao Qiang and didn't clean you up.

7
00:00:12.333 --> 00:00:14.500
Today I must see my walk

8
00:00:15.533 --> 00:00:16.800
Go go go go go

9
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.700
I didn't expect you to dare to come back

10
00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:23.033
What's not to dare?

11
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.000
You shouldn't have come back

12
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.600
And I came back.

13
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.600
Come back and die

14
00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:30.266
It's not certain who died

15
00:00:30.266 --> 00:00:31.500
You have a good talent

16
00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:33.166
But you don't need a smart

17
00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.066
Really smart people know I'm still here

18
00:00:36.266 --> 00:00:37.166
Should stay away

19
00:00:37.166 --> 00:00:38.466
Rather than choosing to face

20
00:00:38.466 --> 00:00:39.566
You're right.

21
00:00:39.566 --> 00:00:41.166
I'm not a smart guy.

22
00:00:41.166 --> 00:00:43.266
But I have responsibility and responsibility.

23
00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:45.033
I also have someone I want to protect

24
00:00:45.266 --> 00:00:47.433
To be brave is to die

25
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.166
Do your best.

26
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.166
life and death

27
00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:52.000
Each has a destiny
