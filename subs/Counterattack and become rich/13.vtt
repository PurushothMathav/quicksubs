00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:03.300
Hai Ge

2
00:00:03.566 --> 00:00:06.666
That Lin Xiaolin is really amazing

3
00:00:06.666 --> 00:00:08.066
I didn't even see how he hit

4
00:00:08.066 --> 00:00:10.966
I flew out.

5
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.766
That kid will definitely be popular

6
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.000
No wonder Li Mingyue followed him silently

7
00:00:20.733 --> 00:00:23.266
I asked you two to come over for a drink

8
00:00:23.366 --> 00:00:24.533
Let you two figure it out

9
00:00:24.533 --> 00:00:26.300
How to deal with Li Xiaolin is not him

10
00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:27.233
silent

11
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:28.500
Not him.

12
00:00:28.533 --> 00:00:31.466
Then Li Xiaolin is simply not human

13
00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.100
It's just amazing.

14
00:00:34.466 --> 00:00:35.966
I want to deal with him.

15
00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.400
I think it can only be cured

16
00:00:39.066 --> 00:00:40.433
How to heal

17
00:00:41.133 --> 00:00:42.233
I haven't thought of it yet.

18
00:00:48.533 --> 00:00:50.300
Xiaoli, what are you doing?

19
00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:51.200
Let me tell you something.

20
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:52.500
This is my home.

21
00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:53.833
Be careful!

22
00:00:55.366 --> 00:00:57.633
Don't get me wrong, I'm here to play cards

23
00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.500
Li Mingming, you can't even look at me normally

24
00:01:01.566 --> 00:01:04.466
The baby's belly is getting bigger now

25
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.100
My belly is getting bigger

26
00:01:18.666 --> 00:01:20.166
I really don't understand

27
00:01:20.166 --> 00:01:22.666
What's so good about that Li Xiaolin?

28
00:01:22.666 --> 00:01:24.266
You still have your eye on him?

29
00:01:24.333 --> 00:01:26.900
You know I was just at that intersection

30
00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:28.333
I saw him go to the mahjong parlor.

31
00:01:28.333 --> 00:01:30.566
As a result, the family lost everything

32
00:01:30.566 --> 00:01:32.866
What kind of money did he pay to marry you?

33
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.066
And just now

34
00:01:34.166 --> 00:01:36.800
I heard your seventh and eighth aunt talking about you.

35
00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.433
How do you say yours?

36
00:01:38.766 --> 00:01:39.500
Sit down.

37
00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:40.900
Did I make you stand up?

38
00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:43.533
I'm warning you!

39
00:01:43.533 --> 00:01:45.800
Don't associate with that Li Xiaoling in the future

40
00:01:46.333 --> 00:01:47.566
You don't want this face

41
00:01:47.566 --> 00:01:49.633
I still want this face.

42
00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:54.500
Same as before

43
00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:55.666
But this time

44
00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:57.633
I don't even have enough
