00:00:01.866 --> 00:00:05.100
Auntie, I have a hard life

2
00:00:05.733 --> 00:00:08.666
What about the ex-wife? She doesn't know anything.

3
00:00:08.666 --> 00:00:10.800
No housework at all

4
00:00:11.133 --> 00:00:13.066
So I'm pissed

5
00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:15.433
Divorced

6
00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:19.200
How about

7
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.100
Getting married is a big deal

8
00:00:21.766 --> 00:00:23.966
You have to know the basics.

9
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:25.533
Like our child

10
00:00:25.533 --> 00:00:26.733
Don't worry.

11
00:00:26.733 --> 00:00:28.833
Doing things is clean and neat

12
00:00:29.066 --> 00:00:32.366
Hey, don't you see that you are going to pick hawthorn again?

13
00:00:32.366 --> 00:00:33.866
Can't be idle at all

14
00:00:33.866 --> 00:00:36.500
Hahaha yeah yeah yeah

15
00:00:36.566 --> 00:00:37.366
you

16
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.400
I thought so.

17
00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.633
I will never be moved again in my life

18
00:00:41.733 --> 00:00:44.400
How can you think of the little bald girl back then?

19
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.666
It's really a female college change

20
00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:48.566
As soon as I see it, ah.

21
00:00:48.566 --> 00:00:50.866
Just like a long drought meets the rain

22
00:00:50.866 --> 00:00:51.900
Miss me

23
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.366
Can't sleep

24
00:00:53.366 --> 00:00:55.866
Auntie hahaha

25
00:00:56.133 --> 00:00:57.533
My child

26
00:00:57.533 --> 00:00:59.766
You go to Shili Ba Village and ask around

27
00:00:59.766 --> 00:01:01.866
No one is more handsome than my child

28
00:01:01.966 --> 00:01:04.766
Ouch, don't listen to that village either

29
00:01:05.166 --> 00:01:07.466
Nonsense my child I know

30
00:01:07.466 --> 00:01:09.200
That's a serious guy
