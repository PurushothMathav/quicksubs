00:00:01.566 --> 00:00:02.866
My aunt

2
00:00:04.066 --> 00:00:06.100
Say uncle and aunt

3
00:00:06.466 --> 00:00:08.200
Mingyue and I are truly in love

4
00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:10.466
Can you really eat that as a meal?

5
00:00:10.466 --> 00:00:11.000
Hey

6
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.100
Auntie is too old to eat such a big cake

7
00:00:15.733 --> 00:00:17.300
I'm getting old.

8
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:19.200
It's hard to raise a child

9
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.266
It's up to him from now on

10
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:23.500
Look at them

11
00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.200
The bride price is 200,000

12
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:26.500
Do you have more?

13
00:00:26.533 --> 00:00:29.166
Of course, then you pose

14
00:00:29.266 --> 00:00:30.366
Not now.

15
00:00:30.766 --> 00:00:32.900
Mouth full of train hum

16
00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:33.700
aunt

17
00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:38.266
From what I've heard, this guy is not that reliable

18
00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:42.400
Two days ago, I grabbed the camellia business with my brother.

19
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.633
It is said that more than 1,000 catties were collected.

20
00:00:45.866 --> 00:00:47.600
Pull it to the provincial capital today.

21
00:00:47.866 --> 00:00:50.533
As a result, as soon as people open it, they take a look

22
00:00:50.533 --> 00:00:52.233
Full of rotten leaves

23
00:00:52.266 --> 00:00:54.500
Isn't this clearly deceiving?

24
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:55.866
That's true

25
00:00:55.866 --> 00:00:56.900
Not so good

26
00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:58.500
Friends have mentioned it

27
00:00:59.666 --> 00:01:03.566
Ouch, look at this guy like a dog

28
00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.666
That's not the case at all.

29
00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.600
It's the two brothers surnamed Wang who answered us

30
00:01:08.733 --> 00:01:10.666
They swapped our goods.

31
00:01:10.733 --> 00:01:12.233
Hey, hey, hey.

32
00:01:13.333 --> 00:01:14.866
May I remind you?

33
00:01:14.966 --> 00:01:17.200
Speak with evidence

34
00:01:17.766 --> 00:01:20.733
We brothers can make money to this day

35
00:01:20.733 --> 00:01:23.166
It's all step by step

36
00:01:23.333 --> 00:01:26.166
Wherever you go, friends will give you a few thin noodles.

37
00:01:27.666 --> 00:01:29.566
If you do it like this

38
00:01:29.766 --> 00:01:31.700
Can we make money today?

39
00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.533
Auntie, do you think this is the reason?

40
00:01:34.533 --> 00:01:38.066
Yes, to do business, you have to clearly list the price

41
00:01:38.066 --> 00:01:39.233
Children are not deceived

42
00:01:39.766 --> 00:01:40.866
Decheng

43
00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:43.600
You said you look at Auntie's age

44
00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.266
Home, big or small.

45
00:01:46.533 --> 00:01:48.900
You said that no one will listen to Auntie's words after this

46
00:01:48.933 --> 00:01:52.833
Ouch, it's okay, it's okay, Auntie has me

47
00:01:54.266 --> 00:01:56.433
We talk as a family

48
00:01:56.933 --> 00:01:58.800
Outsiders are not welcome

49
00:01:59.866 --> 00:02:01.700
unqualified person

50
00:02:02.333 --> 00:02:03.366
roll
