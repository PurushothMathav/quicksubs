00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:01.566
Of course.

2
00:00:01.933 --> 00:00:04.166
But it's okay even if you're pregnant

3
00:00:04.166 --> 00:00:05.466
As long as it's the moon

4
00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:07.033
I will admit it.

5
00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.266
I've thought about it too.

6
00:00:09.266 --> 00:00:11.000
After I married Mingyue

7
00:00:11.166 --> 00:00:14.000
The first child was given the surname Li

8
00:00:14.533 --> 00:00:15.866
Hahaha

9
00:00:16.133 --> 00:00:20.866
I really can't. Can I incriminate my son-in-law?

10
00:00:20.866 --> 00:00:23.166
Hahaha ouch

11
00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.466
Otherwise, this child will be sorted out for more than ten years

12
00:00:26.466 --> 00:00:28.166
Why are you so sensible?

13
00:00:28.266 --> 00:00:30.566
Hahaha, this is his.

14
00:00:30.866 --> 00:00:32.333
About the dowry money

15
00:00:32.333 --> 00:00:33.200
aunt

16
00:00:34.133 --> 00:00:37.100
I can go out to 200,000

17
00:00:37.766 --> 00:00:38.966
200,000

18
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.300
Let me tell you something.

19
00:00:44.333 --> 00:00:47.233
Other people's betrothal gifts are 100,000

20
00:00:47.333 --> 00:00:49.500
You said you were 200,000

21
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:50.566
Are you still letting people go?

22
00:00:50.566 --> 00:00:51.800
He's married.

23
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:54.066
You still want to die

24
00:00:54.066 --> 00:00:56.600
What does it have to do with us whether people's children get married or not?

25
00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.200
They can't afford the bride price and rely on us

26
00:00:59.733 --> 00:01:00.866
Want me to say

27
00:01:00.866 --> 00:01:03.666
Your brain is just in the eyes of money

28
00:01:03.666 --> 00:01:06.266
You don't ask them what the child means

29
00:01:06.266 --> 00:01:08.100
I told you to shut up

30
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.600
Ouch, ask the child

31
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.800
I told you the child was born to me

32
00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.166
I fed him a chopping knife to the dogs

33
00:01:13.166 --> 00:01:16.400
I tell you I won't marry that poor prodigal
