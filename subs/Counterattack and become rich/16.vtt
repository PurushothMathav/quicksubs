00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:04.166
Why didn't you two stop him?

2
00:00:04.733 --> 00:00:05.666
Hai Ge

3
00:00:05.966 --> 00:00:09.266
Do you think there is any chance that the two of us will stop him?

4
00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:10.400
Exactly.

5
00:00:11.133 --> 00:00:12.766
We got beat up by him.

6
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:13.966
It's nothing.

7
00:00:13.966 --> 00:00:16.966
But since he took the initiative to deliver the money to us

8
00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.266
And you let him win?

9
00:00:20.766 --> 00:00:23.400
Do you think I want him to win?

10
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.233
I'm not fucking sick, it's almost 500

11
00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.566
The person who can win

12
00:00:31.133 --> 00:00:34.300
Prove that he must be out of heaven

13
00:00:35.366 --> 00:00:38.233
Damn, this kid dares to cheat

14
00:00:38.866 --> 00:00:39.966
Rules of attendance

15
00:00:40.133 --> 00:00:42.066
Money must be chopped

16
00:00:42.133 --> 00:00:43.366
It's easy

17
00:00:43.733 --> 00:00:44.666
OK

18
00:00:45.366 --> 00:00:46.166
past

19
00:00:46.566 --> 00:00:47.800
He chopped it raw

20
00:00:47.866 --> 00:00:50.166
Get the money back by the way

21
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
At least you dare to lie

22
00:00:56.766 --> 00:00:58.766
Watch me burn down your mahjong parlor

23
00:00:59.533 --> 00:01:00.766
Who is it?

24
00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:03.000
Hey!

25
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.066
Joy oh why did you come to town to sit

26
00:01:06.066 --> 00:01:07.100
Hey, are you thirsty?

27
00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:08.366
I'll go get you a drink

28
00:01:08.366 --> 00:01:09.766
What about Li Xiaolin?

29
00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.433
That's a long story.

30
00:01:13.666 --> 00:01:15.266
Then you make a long story short

31
00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:17.733
That's getting divorced in the morning

32
00:01:17.733 --> 00:01:19.300
And they beat us up.

33
00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:22.000
Then came here again, won the money and left

34
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.466
Gone, not kidnapped by you

35
00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:26.566
That's not possible.

36
00:01:26.566 --> 00:01:28.766
We never do that kind of illegal thing.

37
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.233
Thanks for your answer.

38
00:01:31.266 --> 00:01:31.966
Hey

39
00:01:31.966 --> 00:01:34.666
No, you're welcome, our real-world friends, you're gone.
