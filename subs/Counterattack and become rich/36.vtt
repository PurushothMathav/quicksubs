00:00:00.966 --> 00:00:03.700
Wang Defa was arrogant when facing us

2
00:00:03.733 --> 00:00:06.366
Hey, I see after he was knocked down by Brother Kobayashi's mud fist

3
00:00:06.466 --> 00:00:07.966
Good as a rabbit

4
00:00:08.333 --> 00:00:09.300
I was

5
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.100
I want to be nervous with them in a normal way

6
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:11.900
But they did.

7
00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:12.966
You three are unruly

8
00:00:12.966 --> 00:00:14.700
I can't just sit back and watch

9
00:00:14.733 --> 00:00:16.800
This kind of thing will happen sooner or later

10
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:17.666
Can't open

11
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.700
If you can collect camellia normally in the future

12
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:22.300
Our progress will be much faster

13
00:00:22.766 --> 00:00:24.766
Because what we're talking about is fine tea.

14
00:00:24.933 --> 00:00:26.533
Huang Defa charges 60 catties.

15
00:00:26.533 --> 00:00:27.866
We charge 100 a jin.

16
00:00:27.933 --> 00:00:29.433
Farmers are willing to sell to us

17
00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:31.200
What about the price?

18
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.166
It can go up a little more appropriately.

19
00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:35.333
It also prompts, especially for family difficulties

20
00:00:35.333 --> 00:00:37.166
Do you understand?

21
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.133
But we have limited funds.

22
00:00:40.133 --> 00:00:42.000
What did you say last time? It cost more than 3,000

23
00:00:42.333 --> 00:00:43.600
Go on like this

24
00:00:43.966 --> 00:00:45.600
Up to 7 days

25
00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:48.700
Time is not a problem

26
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.566
It just so happens that the supplier over there in the mall

27
00:00:51.566 --> 00:00:54.233
Already promised the review of life so soon

28
00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.000
If you let me go, I'll leave

29
00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.466
I can't find the door anywhere

30
00:00:58.466 --> 00:00:59.400
Good luck!

31
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:00.166
Just met

32
00:01:00.166 --> 00:01:01.700
People are saying that people like us are screened.

33
00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:03.100
And our quality is also good.

34
00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:03.600
So to speak

35
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.666
We will be the supplier of the big mall in the future.

36
00:01:06.133 --> 00:01:08.200
Mall suppliers are just a proof

37
00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:10.866
The final sales method must be on the Internet

38
00:01:11.333 --> 00:01:12.266
Internet

39
00:01:13.466 --> 00:01:16.100
No, we can't receive the money when we send the goods, right?

40
00:01:16.533 --> 00:01:18.433
This concern is not a family

41
00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.200
But the mall has also given corresponding norms

42
00:01:21.366 --> 00:01:23.366
He said that as long as you are good

43
00:01:23.366 --> 00:01:25.933
The first batch of finished products will be handed over to this mall.

44
00:01:25.933 --> 00:01:27.433
If it is not closed

45
00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.400
The serial number and license mall will help you handle it.

46
00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:31.966
That's very nice.
