00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:04.166
Not to mention that you are a big smart machine

2
00:00:04.166 --> 00:00:06.300
The mobile phone will come out in two years.

3
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:07.500
Who still buys your BP machine?

4
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:08.966
What is a cell phone?

5
00:00:08.966 --> 00:00:10.700
The big brother mobile phone is

6
00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:12.866
Say

7
00:00:12.866 --> 00:00:16.000
It's a communication tool used in developed cities today.

8
00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:17.866
Hey, you listen to me anyway

9
00:00:18.166 --> 00:00:19.100
Don't sell this store.

10
00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:21.400
If the store doesn't sell, you can pay for the loss.

11
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:23.900
OK.

12
00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:25.866
You give me a chance for a few months

13
00:00:25.866 --> 00:00:28.100
I promise to bring this store back to life

14
00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:30.133
Whether to turn it around or not

15
00:00:30.133 --> 00:00:31.300
I'm busy.

16
00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.200
No time to listen to pussy bragging here

17
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.800
No transfer, please pay the fee.

18
00:00:35.866 --> 00:00:37.333
Wasting my time

19
00:00:37.333 --> 00:00:39.600
Hey, boss Liu Liu

20
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.266
What is Jiang Lili going to do?

21
00:00:44.566 --> 00:00:47.966
Brother Lin An, why are you fooling around with me?

22
00:00:48.533 --> 00:00:51.866
Jiang Lili, you'd better tell me what you want to do

23
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.066
This material is really good

24
00:00:56.066 --> 00:00:57.133
They don't buy it?

25
00:00:57.133 --> 00:00:58.333
They don't know the goods.

26
00:00:58.333 --> 00:01:00.566
This store was left to me by my parents

27
00:01:00.566 --> 00:01:02.200
But I don't know how to sell clothes

28
00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:03.933
I thought it was the poor quality at first.

29
00:01:03.933 --> 00:01:05.800
So I went to the coastal city on purpose last month

30
00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:07.000
A batch of new materials has arrived.

31
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.433
But there aren't that many.

32
00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.000
The unit price is high, but the sample hand is not good-looking.

33
00:01:11.666 --> 00:01:12.700
Who would like to buy it?

34
00:01:12.733 --> 00:01:15.333
Don't pretend you know.

35
00:01:15.333 --> 00:01:17.333
You've never even touched such a fine fabric

36
00:01:17.333 --> 00:01:18.733
I still want to sell clothes

37
00:01:18.733 --> 00:01:20.000
This dress

38
00:01:20.533 --> 00:01:21.800
I don't like it at all

39
00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.666
Not only do you dislike me, but you also want a low-price promotion.

40
00:01:26.766 --> 00:01:28.600
What? Are you crazy?

41
00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.966
Do you know how much this dress is worth?

42
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.033
Brother, trust me.

43
00:01:33.066 --> 00:01:34.700
I am your greatest asset
