00:00:00.766 --> 00:00:03.200
How can this be called an insult? Get married in July

2
00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:04.366
Mr. Ba over the rainbow

3
00:00:04.366 --> 00:00:06.600
It's very popular in novels

4
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.466
You think you are doing it to repay the kindness

5
00:00:08.533 --> 00:00:10.000
I also want to repay your kindness.

6
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.700
When I'm done paying the money

7
00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.600
You and I will go our separate ways without delay.

8
00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:17.800
Jiang Lili, is this really what you want?

9
00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.833
Well, that's called taking a step back

10
00:00:20.866 --> 00:00:24.100
Xu Ling loves me, but she doesn't believe that I can't fight you

11
00:00:32.766 --> 00:00:34.300
Why are you so troublesome

12
00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:35.533
You don't have to pay it back.

13
00:00:35.533 --> 00:00:37.200
You can go now.

14
00:00:37.466 --> 00:00:39.600
Xu Lingan, you are angry

15
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.300
No. I just don't think we have parents.

16
00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.000
You are already missing from the three 6s.

17
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.466
It is impossible not to give a bride price

18
00:00:45.566 --> 00:00:46.666
This money

19
00:00:47.466 --> 00:00:48.733
It's a dowry for you

20
00:00:48.733 --> 00:00:49.800
Betrothal gift

21
00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.633
$10,000 is a lot of money these days.

22
00:00:52.866 --> 00:00:54.766
Who asked a good person to give a bride price of 10,000?

23
00:00:54.766 --> 00:00:56.266
Why don't you want it?

24
00:00:56.266 --> 00:00:57.466
Don't want to give it to me

25
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:02.700
But after paying off the money, I'm leaving.

26
00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:04.866
Do you really want me to leave so quickly?

27
00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:20.700
Give it to me it's mine

28
00:01:21.266 --> 00:01:22.066
No.
