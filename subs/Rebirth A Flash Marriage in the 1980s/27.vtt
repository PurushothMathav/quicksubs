1
00:00:06.533 --> 00:00:07.566
How much did you earn?

2
00:00:07.866 --> 00:00:09.566
More than 1,000. That's a lot.

3
00:00:09.933 --> 00:00:10.733
Factory workers

4
00:00:10.733 --> 00:00:12.966
You can't make that much money in a year at work.

5
00:00:13.133 --> 00:00:13.733
I'm awesome

6
00:00:13.733 --> 00:00:14.600
OK

7
00:00:14.866 --> 00:00:17.566
So these are our startup funds.

8
00:00:17.766 --> 00:00:20.500
Find a few skilled tailors for this part

9
00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:21.700
How do you start measuring?

10
00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:22.900
I can't do it alone.

11
00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:26.466
How about these? Buy some sewing machines.

12
00:00:26.566 --> 00:00:27.700
And this last part

13
00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:28.766
It's us in a few days.

14
00:00:28.766 --> 00:00:30.266
I need the money for the fabric.

15
00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.566
But it's just a small clothing store.

16
00:00:32.566 --> 00:00:35.000
What if you can't sell that much after mass production?

17
00:00:35.066 --> 00:00:36.600
Don't underestimate this clothing store

18
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.700
This is us going national

19
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.266
It's the bedrock of the world.

20
00:00:40.266 --> 00:00:42.766
I'm relying on him to become C1

21
00:00:42.766 --> 00:00:45.833
I am taller than Xue, richer and more handsome, and I am on my way to the peak of my life

22
00:00:45.866 --> 00:00:46.800
Who to marry

23
00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:48.900
Bah

24
00:00:49.666 --> 00:00:50.766
Don't worry.

25
00:00:50.766 --> 00:00:52.866
I'm well prepared

26
00:00:52.866 --> 00:00:54.100
Besides group buying?

27
00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.100
There are multiple actors.

28
00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:57.700
As long as the mind doesn't slide

29
00:00:57.733 --> 00:00:59.066
There are more solutions than difficulties

30
00:00:59.366 --> 00:01:01.800
Look, who is giving it away for free?

31
00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.300
Private custom membership recharge

32
00:01:04.566 --> 00:01:07.000
So many great ideas, how did you come up with them?

33
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.366
Of course never in a hurry

34
00:01:09.666 --> 00:01:12.266
Don't worry about me, Xiaohongshu thinks about him by himself

35
00:01:14.733 --> 00:01:18.166
Read more books in your own golden house

36
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.300
By the way, go to bed early.

37
00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.566
Will the psychological conference be busy in a few days?

38
00:01:28.566 --> 00:01:31.866
Jiang Li, what other surprises do you have? I don't know.
