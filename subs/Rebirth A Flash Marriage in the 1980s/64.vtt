00:00:11.166 --> 00:00:13.066
I drank too many bottles last night

2
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.633
What's up?

3
00:00:22.266 --> 00:00:23.833
Is that okay, sister?

4
00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.233
But why don't I feel tired at all?

5
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.100
Xiong Ya

6
00:00:32.333 --> 00:00:33.833
Shouldn't you

7
00:00:36.533 --> 00:00:38.166
You threw up all over me last night

8
00:00:38.166 --> 00:00:39.800
Vomited four times

9
00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.466
You don't want to admit it, do you?

10
00:00:41.666 --> 00:00:43.833
So nothing happened to us.

11
00:00:44.166 --> 00:00:46.166
So where did my excitement come from?

12
00:00:46.166 --> 00:00:49.233
I didn't say anything I shouldn't have said

13
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.033
Nope.

14
00:00:58.166 --> 00:00:59.200
small rice grains

15
00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.966
The first dress is ruined.

16
00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:06.300
Good sister-in-law

17
00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:07.100
It exploded. It exploded.

18
00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.333
Teresa Teng's concert opened a pair we sponsored

19
00:01:09.333 --> 00:01:09.966
On TV

20
00:01:09.966 --> 00:01:12.800
Now the factory's order call has been exploded.

21
00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:13.600
Really?

22
00:01:13.733 --> 00:01:17.066
How many orders are there now? Wang Shou estimates 2,000 orders.
