00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:02.700
Where's my money?

2
00:00:02.933 --> 00:00:04.166
How did it become a blank slate?

3
00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.833
The money is gone, I don't know.

4
00:00:08.266 --> 00:00:09.766
What the hell is going on?

5
00:00:11.466 --> 00:00:13.733
Boss Zhang, are you kidding me?

6
00:00:13.733 --> 00:00:16.166
I pulled this product for you well.

7
00:00:16.166 --> 00:00:17.766
You don't want to give money, do you?

8
00:00:17.766 --> 00:00:21.066
I didn't I just had someone move the box

9
00:00:21.533 --> 00:00:22.333
Could it be that

10
00:00:24.566 --> 00:00:26.866
It's a member pulling the goods, do you still want it?

11
00:00:26.866 --> 00:00:28.700
No, but there are still many people waiting

12
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.700
I we want

13
00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:32.500
Li Li for your new product launch

14
00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:33.733
You've been up several nights.

15
00:00:33.733 --> 00:00:34.666
Do your plan

16
00:00:34.666 --> 00:00:36.066
Without these fabrics

17
00:00:36.133 --> 00:00:37.400
Your efforts are in vain

18
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:38.733
But we've run out of money.

19
00:00:38.733 --> 00:00:39.766
Money, I'll find a way

20
00:00:39.766 --> 00:00:41.266
But I have to go to the provincial capital first.

21
00:00:41.266 --> 00:00:42.833
It will take at least two days.

22
00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.766
I don't have time to wait for you to play with me for two days

23
00:00:46.766 --> 00:00:47.566
Hey

24
00:00:48.966 --> 00:00:50.200
Eli

25
00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:51.366
I'm leaving now.

26
00:00:51.366 --> 00:00:52.966
Come back as fast as you can

27
00:00:52.966 --> 00:00:54.100
If it really doesn't work

28
00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.266
We can go to another factory to buy raw materials.

29
00:00:56.466 --> 00:00:59.000
It's useless. Our batch of materials is imported from abroad.

30
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.900
Customs will only release it every half month.

31
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:02.300
Even if you get your money back

32
00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.300
That batch of materials will not flow in until half a month later

33
00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:05.800
But our new product launch

34
00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:06.700
Just 3 days later

35
00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:07.700
Can't catch him up

36
00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:09.800
How about delaying the release of the new product?

37
00:01:10.366 --> 00:01:11.200
That won't work either.

38
00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.333
We are originally a small shop with a name of gold bricks.

39
00:01:13.333 --> 00:01:14.466
After so much effort

40
00:01:14.466 --> 00:01:16.333
Just for the new product launch in 3 days.

41
00:01:16.333 --> 00:01:18.366
If this cuts off all the guests again

42
00:01:18.366 --> 00:01:19.800
To rebuild trust

43
00:01:20.066 --> 00:01:20.866
It gets harder.

44
00:01:20.866 --> 00:01:21.766
What to do then?

45
00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.966
Wealth payments and equipment are already in place

46
00:01:24.066 --> 00:01:25.266
Isn't this lost?

47
00:01:25.533 --> 00:01:26.966
Abang Bao Public Security

48
00:01:26.966 --> 00:01:29.000
I numbered all those bills

49
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.366
Make sure to find out who moved what you're worried about
