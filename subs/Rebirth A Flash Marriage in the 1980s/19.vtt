00:00:01.266 --> 00:00:02.766
You are the owner of this store

2
00:00:02.766 --> 00:00:04.933
Dude, this kid has a little money.

3
00:00:04.933 --> 00:00:06.466
Can afford a clothing store

4
00:00:06.466 --> 00:00:09.500
Hey, who is this woman Huimin?

5
00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:11.066
How do I feel?

6
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:13.200
He has a special relationship with this boss.

7
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.766
Officially introduce yourself

8
00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:16.900
I am Xu Lin'an's wife

9
00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:19.466
The lady boss of this store is justifiable

10
00:00:19.533 --> 00:00:20.600
What kind of lady boss are you?

11
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.933
This store was obviously handed over to me by Brother Lin An

12
00:00:22.933 --> 00:00:24.166
You are shameless

13
00:00:24.166 --> 00:00:25.566
So you're pretty good at taking care of it?

14
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.400
I let you close the door.

15
00:00:30.133 --> 00:00:31.533
Is this the transfer?

16
00:00:31.533 --> 00:00:33.200
Hey, yes, yes, yes.

17
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.066
Are you Boss Liu?

18
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.133
I thought it was such a good shop

19
00:00:38.133 --> 00:00:39.600
Doesn't it look good?

20
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.766
Boss Liu, our location is excellent.

21
00:00:42.766 --> 00:00:44.133
If it weren't for the lack of money now

22
00:00:44.133 --> 00:00:45.833
We will definitely not transfer it.

23
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:49.100
Take a look at this stall, I can take over.

24
00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.233
But at this price

25
00:00:51.566 --> 00:00:53.800
Give me at least two more minutes

26
00:00:54.366 --> 00:00:55.500
Excuse me?

27
00:00:55.533 --> 00:00:57.300
We are not transferring this store.

28
00:00:57.733 --> 00:00:58.866
What does that mean?

29
00:00:58.866 --> 00:00:59.600
Miss Tao

30
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.533
I came to take over because of your face

31
00:01:02.533 --> 00:01:03.333
how

32
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.966
Aren't you from the studio of this store?

33
00:01:06.966 --> 00:01:07.766
Don't be angry.

34
00:01:07.766 --> 00:01:09.166
We will definitely transfer it.

35
00:01:09.166 --> 00:01:10.300
I said no.

36
00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.166
Zhang Linlin, what do you want to do?

37
00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:13.900
Linlin stall business is not good

38
00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:15.200
It's a loss to keep it in your hands

39
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.500
It's just that Brother Lin and I have already discussed it.

40
00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:18.966
Wait until you sell this stall

41
00:01:18.966 --> 00:01:22.266
We are going to the Electric City to rent a stall and sell BP machines.

42
00:01:22.266 --> 00:01:24.566
That's the most profitable business right now

43
00:01:24.566 --> 00:01:27.066
Do you want to cut off Brother Lin's fortune?
