1
00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:03.666
Not me not me

2
00:00:03.933 --> 00:00:06.666
Jiang Linlin, when are you going to hurt me?

3
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.600
Tao Huimin, do you know

4
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:11.800
If the person who came that day was not Section Chief Wang

5
00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:12.900
It's someone else's words.

6
00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.200
You will ruin Rongmei's show

7
00:00:16.333 --> 00:00:18.266
I didn't mean to, Ange Lin

8
00:00:18.266 --> 00:00:19.966
I'm just pissed

9
00:00:19.966 --> 00:00:21.366
I apologize to you.

10
00:00:21.733 --> 00:00:24.233
On the contrary, you can explain it to the police.

11
00:00:24.466 --> 00:00:26.666
I don't want Lin Ange

12
00:00:26.733 --> 00:00:28.400
You forgot that my brother saved you

13
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.466
Don't you want the friendship between you?

14
00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.533
I just miss the friendship between me and your brother

15
00:00:36.533 --> 00:00:38.166
I will always take care of you and your father

16
00:00:38.166 --> 00:00:39.800
But I don't owe you anything.

17
00:00:42.133 --> 00:00:42.966
joint

18
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.700
I don't want to send it to the police.

19
00:00:47.266 --> 00:00:48.600
Then you write a word

20
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.666
From today onwards, you and Xu Lin Anen are also fine

21
00:00:51.666 --> 00:00:52.566
Complain

22
00:00:53.333 --> 00:00:55.700
I don't write two clear

23
00:00:56.333 --> 00:00:57.266
Lin'an brother

24
00:00:57.266 --> 00:00:59.300
You know I have no source of income right now

25
00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:00.866
You want me to make this statement?

26
00:01:00.866 --> 00:01:02.800
Are you trying to force me to death?

27
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.200
You have such a high degree

28
00:01:04.466 --> 00:01:05.533
You have hands and feet

29
00:01:05.533 --> 00:01:07.666
Why can't I get a real job?

30
00:01:07.733 --> 00:01:09.266
What's your business?

31
00:01:10.333 --> 00:01:12.600
Brother Lin'an, I don't want anything anymore

32
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.400
I beg you, don't leave me, okay?

33
00:01:19.133 --> 00:01:21.566
Hye-min, sign the words

34
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.533
Satellite brother, what your brother An said is true

35
00:01:25.533 --> 00:01:26.700
Only you signed the words

36
00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.466
So you don't go to jail?

37
00:01:28.533 --> 00:01:30.266
If I sign this sentence

38
00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.466
I have nothing left, you still have me

39
00:01:35.066 --> 00:01:36.833
Actually, I wanted to tell you

40
00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:38.666
I like you.

41
00:01:39.133 --> 00:01:40.433
I want to take care of you.
