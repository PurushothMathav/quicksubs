00:00:00.866 --> 00:00:02.766
Although the environment is a bit poor

2
00:00:02.766 --> 00:00:04.666
But the food tastes excellent

3
00:00:04.666 --> 00:00:07.600
Try it to see if it tastes like your hometown.

4
00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.633
I said how did you come across the restaurant?

5
00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:21.200
How do you know where I'm from?

6
00:00:27.166 --> 00:00:29.300
Jiang Lili, have you never thought about it?

7
00:00:29.333 --> 00:00:32.666
Perhaps we will meet in 2023

8
00:00:33.066 --> 00:00:35.100
I came to this world a year before you

9
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:35.966
But it doesn't mean

10
00:00:35.966 --> 00:00:38.100
I don't start from the same place as you

11
00:00:38.133 --> 00:00:40.766
But you standing in the spotlight

12
00:00:40.766 --> 00:00:43.200
How can you see me offstage?

13
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.366
You say yes.

14
00:00:44.866 --> 00:00:49.000
Jiang Li, do you really know me?

15
00:00:50.733 --> 00:00:53.566
Then, haven't you seen me with 100 kilograms?

16
00:00:53.566 --> 00:00:55.400
I worked hard to lose weight

17
00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:56.966
I finally met a real-world friend

18
00:00:56.966 --> 00:00:59.000
Why do you still let me accept my sister-in-law?

19
00:00:59.566 --> 00:01:02.066
Hey what do you care about

20
00:01:02.166 --> 00:01:03.400
So what about 100 kilograms?

21
00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:04.566
Anyway.

22
00:01:04.566 --> 00:01:05.800
You look good.

23
00:01:07.766 --> 00:01:09.366
Really. Hmm.

24
00:01:11.066 --> 00:01:13.133
By the way, this is a column I did

25
00:01:13.133 --> 00:01:14.000
Take a look!

26
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.133
Still as I told you before

27
00:01:15.133 --> 00:01:17.966
30% higher than the market price for you.

28
00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.333
You have the habit of putting your own manuscript in the newspapers

29
00:01:20.333 --> 00:01:21.400
Not bad, huh?

30
00:01:21.766 --> 00:01:22.466
But

31
00:01:22.466 --> 00:01:25.500
I really have to thank you for the manuscript you gave President Meng last time

32
00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.833
Let me recognize you at a glance

33
00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.000
After all, in this day and age

34
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.400
But no one can use the knife-fighting routine

35
00:01:32.766 --> 00:01:34.666
Hahahahaha novice

36
00:01:35.133 --> 00:01:36.633
Newbie, eat it

37
00:01:42.366 --> 00:01:45.100
Mr. Zhou, I have news here.

38
00:01:45.366 --> 00:01:46.566
Are you interested?
