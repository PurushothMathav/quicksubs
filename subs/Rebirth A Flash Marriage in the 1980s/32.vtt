00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:02.366
Oops you big liar

2
00:00:02.466 --> 00:00:05.000
He also said that he would be back in two days. Today is the third day.

3
00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:06.900
I'm watching a movie, why are you on your way?

4
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:09.166
Come, come, come with me to the store to register, everyone

5
00:00:11.133 --> 00:00:12.266
You're worried about me?

6
00:00:12.266 --> 00:00:13.366
Then what?

7
00:00:13.466 --> 00:00:16.033
Abang and I are in a hurry to go abroad to report our disappearance

8
00:00:16.133 --> 00:00:18.866
Sorry, there was a landslide on the way back.

9
00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:20.633
The car can't pass

10
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:21.900
landslide

11
00:00:22.466 --> 00:00:25.200
You walked back a few hundred kilometers

12
00:00:32.333 --> 00:00:35.000
Forget it, this is what I saw on the way back

13
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.866
I think you should like it.

14
00:00:36.866 --> 00:00:39.766
But they're all old. I like them.

15
00:00:41.466 --> 00:00:42.666
I like it too

16
00:00:46.066 --> 00:00:47.466
Why is that?

17
00:00:47.466 --> 00:00:49.500
This is

18
00:00:52.766 --> 00:00:54.733
Xu Ling, haven't you learned your lesson yet?

19
00:00:54.733 --> 00:00:55.766
Don't show it

20
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.066
That's not right.

21
00:01:02.766 --> 00:01:04.400
Rainforest, where did you get so much money?

22
00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:05.566
You robbed a bank?

23
00:01:05.566 --> 00:01:08.700
My parents left me some savings when they were alive

24
00:01:08.966 --> 00:01:09.900
a little

25
00:01:10.566 --> 00:01:12.266
You call that a little bit?

26
00:01:12.333 --> 00:01:15.033
No wonder Xu Linan felt guilty about Jiang Lili

27
00:01:15.066 --> 00:01:17.400
Jiang Lili's father gave an indicator of returning to the city

28
00:01:17.466 --> 00:01:19.366
It's just making him half of the country

29
00:01:19.366 --> 00:01:22.766
Jiang Lili, you deserve this blessing

30
00:01:23.666 --> 00:01:26.433
Jiang Lili, what about Xiaofan, Xu Lian?

31
00:01:28.133 --> 00:01:29.433
I am you.

32
00:01:29.566 --> 00:01:33.400
If I knew you were so rich, I wouldn't work hard

33
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.200
You get up first

34
00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.400
Sorry, I thought I had enough money before

35
00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.566
But after that happened

36
00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.066
I think I still have to leave you some money to release

37
00:01:45.066 --> 00:01:47.600
Hmm, you understand a lot

38
00:01:48.333 --> 00:01:52.566
Then what are you doing? Is the Double 11 pre-sale still going on?

39
00:01:52.566 --> 00:01:53.533
Of course you have to

40
00:01:53.533 --> 00:01:55.266
We have money now

41
00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:57.866
Not only do you have to do it, you have to do it big

42
00:01:57.866 --> 00:02:01.600
I decided to start a fragrance costume show

43
00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.366
Let our brand become a hit
