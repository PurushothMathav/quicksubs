1
00:00:00.466 --> 00:00:01.666
Just follow this size.

2
00:00:01.666 --> 00:00:02.500
Do you hear me?

3
00:00:04.866 --> 00:00:05.600
Okay, get busy.

4
00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:06.500
Pay attention to safety

5
00:00:07.866 --> 00:00:09.366
What's the good news this time?

6
00:00:09.366 --> 00:00:10.533
Kyoto Television

7
00:00:10.533 --> 00:00:12.866
Organized by the top fashion magazines in the United Nations

8
00:00:12.866 --> 00:00:14.100
Fashion Design Exhibition

9
00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:16.266
This is an incredible opportunity.

10
00:00:16.266 --> 00:00:17.400
I signed you up.

11
00:00:17.733 --> 00:00:18.700
Where are you?

12
00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:21.300
Zhou Yuchen, you are really my lucky star

13
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.800
And this time the theme of the competition is autumn men's clothing

14
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.800
I am experienced in this area

15
00:00:28.933 --> 00:00:30.100
Can I give you a hand?

16
00:00:30.266 --> 00:00:31.600
You can move here.

17
00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.133
You are a professional in journalism

18
00:00:33.133 --> 00:00:36.000
But making clothes is my comfort zone

19
00:00:43.466 --> 00:00:45.666
He really shines, right?

20
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.833
I saw his light before you did

21
00:00:49.866 --> 00:00:52.800
I know you come from the same era.

22
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.266
Have the same height

23
00:00:54.266 --> 00:00:56.633
My thinking is decades behind yours

24
00:00:56.766 --> 00:00:58.766
This is the chasm I will never be able to cross

25
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.500
He even told you that.

26
00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.566
I guess otherwise I really don't understand

27
00:01:03.566 --> 00:01:05.700
Why have you two never met?

28
00:01:05.733 --> 00:01:07.400
But it's so easy

29
00:01:07.533 --> 00:01:08.133
I also watch

30
00:01:08.133 --> 00:01:10.300
Every article you read in Jinghong Pictorial

31
00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:10.866
article

32
00:01:10.866 --> 00:01:14.033
Your thinking is really similar to his.

33
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.766
You're smart.

34
00:01:15.766 --> 00:01:17.000
But so what?

35
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.033
You two are only contractually married

36
00:01:22.066 --> 00:01:23.166
You say this?
