00:00:01.966 --> 00:00:02.800
Slow down.

2
00:00:08.133 --> 00:00:09.000
Hey little dragon

3
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.766
Do you think my sister-in-law will lose weight and damage her brain?

4
00:00:11.766 --> 00:00:13.466
What kind of bad idea is this?

5
00:00:14.066 --> 00:00:15.600
Sister-in-law is broken.

6
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:16.800
What about Brother An?

7
00:00:16.866 --> 00:00:18.366
Brother An's brain is also broken

8
00:00:19.466 --> 00:00:21.000
Are you sure this is okay?

9
00:00:28.533 --> 00:00:29.566
What are you doing?

10
00:00:29.566 --> 00:00:31.900
I see it says free delivery on the back of your plate.

11
00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:34.300
This doesn't look like a bad thing

12
00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:35.200
Absolutely.

13
00:00:37.166 --> 00:00:38.600
As long as the dart in your hand

14
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.500
And hit any square on the turntable.

15
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:41.400
Clothes in the store

16
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:42.933
According to the content on the grid

17
00:00:42.933 --> 00:00:44.866
I'll reduce this price for you.

18
00:00:44.866 --> 00:00:46.466
And not only can you do it yourself

19
00:00:46.466 --> 00:00:47.066
You can also pull it.

20
00:00:47.066 --> 00:00:48.600
Friends around you will help you vote together.

21
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.000
The more people come, the better the chance.

22
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.166
This price will naturally get lower.

23
00:00:53.166 --> 00:00:55.166
Really, how are you going to play this month?

24
00:00:55.533 --> 00:00:57.166
Auntie, let me show you

25
00:00:57.166 --> 00:00:58.600
Which dress do you like?

26
00:00:59.866 --> 00:01:01.500
Okay, take a look.

27
00:01:03.866 --> 00:01:06.200
Wow lady you are so lucky

28
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.266
I'll give you 10 yuan off in one fell swoop.

29
00:01:08.266 --> 00:01:11.466
Hey, ma'am, why don't you try it yourself?

30
00:01:14.733 --> 00:01:16.466
Isn't it cut this time?

31
00:01:16.466 --> 00:01:18.566
Auntie, this dress is yours.

32
00:01:18.566 --> 00:01:19.766
That's it.

33
00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:21.000
That's it.

34
00:01:21.933 --> 00:01:24.366
Then I'll take this wool gown, ma'am

35
00:01:24.366 --> 00:01:26.266
This wool sweater costs 30 yuan.

36
00:01:26.266 --> 00:01:27.966
If you want to buy it for 0 yuan.

37
00:01:27.966 --> 00:01:30.166
You can pull more friends around you.

38
00:01:30.166 --> 00:01:31.866
Let's help you fight together.

39
00:01:32.266 --> 00:01:33.666
Then I'll find someone to go

40
00:01:34.533 --> 00:01:35.833
Auntie, take your time

41
00:01:36.066 --> 00:01:39.766
What's the use of three aunts?

42
00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.933
Don't underestimate big girls

43
00:01:42.933 --> 00:01:47.066
The power of a big girl is incomparably terrifying

44
00:02:09.666 --> 00:02:11.066
There are two flavors.

45
00:02:11.733 --> 00:02:12.866
Little brothers

46
00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.700
Ready to pick up guests
