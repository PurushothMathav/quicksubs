00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:05.800
Suck your stomach

2
00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.533
Jiang Nini, are you fat again?

3
00:00:14.533 --> 00:00:18.166
These 6 plus skirts can't pull anything.

4
00:00:18.166 --> 00:00:22.433
You see, he can't fit in even 10 pulps.

5
00:00:24.266 --> 00:00:25.766
Did you hide it outside on purpose?

6
00:00:25.766 --> 00:00:27.266
This is clearly not my size

7
00:00:27.266 --> 00:00:28.333
Excuse me?

8
00:00:28.333 --> 00:00:30.466
This is the largest size dress in my store.

9
00:00:30.466 --> 00:00:32.766
I didn't know you could be so fat

10
00:00:33.766 --> 00:00:35.566
Hahahaha

11
00:00:36.366 --> 00:00:37.633
Ha ha.

12
00:00:39.066 --> 00:00:41.100
I don't need you all to get me out

13
00:00:41.333 --> 00:00:43.366
Go, go, go, go too

14
00:00:44.566 --> 00:00:46.100
Humph ginger rice grains

15
00:00:46.166 --> 00:00:47.766
I see how you still participate in mine

16
00:00:52.366 --> 00:00:53.766
Want me to give up

17
00:00:53.766 --> 00:00:55.166
You are still so

18
00:00:55.366 --> 00:00:57.700
Brother An really wants to go to the river

19
00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.733
I heard that this river is fat and ugly

20
00:01:00.733 --> 00:01:02.000
It's really from the vest.

21
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.966
Me and you

22
00:01:03.933 --> 00:01:05.900
If you don't speak, no one will let you be the boss

23
00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:07.733
But Ange

24
00:01:07.733 --> 00:01:09.566
This Gui Min and eliminated your sister

25
00:01:09.566 --> 00:01:10.900
It's also what I've seen since I was a child

26
00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:12.366
This is for your comfort.

27
00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:13.833
The Jiang family promised me eternity

28
00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:15.000
It's my responsibility.

29
00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:19.200
Brother Li An's wedding today

30
00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:20.900
He can't do it

31
00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.300
What's the matter, leave him

32
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.966
Divorce broke the marriage canal

33
00:01:24.966 --> 00:01:26.166
Got a big fire

34
00:01:26.166 --> 00:01:27.733
Kicked us all out

35
00:01:27.733 --> 00:01:28.566
What can we do about this?

36
00:01:28.566 --> 00:01:30.000
This is just in time

37
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.233
Really can't

38
00:01:31.533 --> 00:01:32.400
or

39
00:01:32.933 --> 00:01:34.033
Ask me to postpone

40
00:01:34.066 --> 00:01:35.200
Pick another good time

41
00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.066
Pick a bigger dress for the bride

42
00:01:37.533 --> 00:01:39.266
Yes, yes, extension, extension.

43
00:01:39.533 --> 00:01:41.100
Who said it was going to be postponed?
