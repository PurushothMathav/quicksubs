00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:03.666
Hello President Meng

2
00:00:03.666 --> 00:00:05.733
I'm from Soft Beauty Clothing Store. What's the matter?

3
00:00:05.733 --> 00:00:08.066
I am about to welcome an important guest

4
00:00:08.066 --> 00:00:09.200
May I help you?

5
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:10.333
Make an appointment at the front desk

6
00:00:10.333 --> 00:00:12.400
Oh, I've asked you out many times.

7
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.000
But you've never had a schedule.

8
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:14.466
actually

9
00:00:14.466 --> 00:00:16.966
I just want to be in the next issue of Jiangnan Newspaper

10
00:00:16.966 --> 00:00:19.000
Put up a little ad

11
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.966
Promote our fashion show.

12
00:00:20.966 --> 00:00:22.400
Do you understand the rules?

13
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.400
Our Jiangnan Evening News is a big magazine

14
00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.333
How can it suit you, a clothes seller, who can log in if you want?

15
00:00:27.333 --> 00:00:28.600
I understand. I understand.

16
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:29.900
I will pay for advertising

17
00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:33.000
Advertising fees. How much can you make as a clothes seller?

18
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.600
I am a dignified president

19
00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.233
The upcoming reception is Zhou Bochen, a business expert

20
00:00:37.333 --> 00:00:39.400
The value I can create in one minute

21
00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.266
Enough to sell your clothes to death

22
00:00:41.266 --> 00:00:42.166
And you know what?

23
00:00:42.166 --> 00:00:45.200
President Meng doesn't need to humiliate people like this, right?

24
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.533
What's wrong with the clothes seller?

25
00:00:46.533 --> 00:00:48.033
Occupations are not divided into high and low

26
00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:49.700
Occupation does not distinguish between high and low

27
00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:50.700
But people are divided.

28
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.866
Somebody chase them away

29
00:00:52.966 --> 00:00:55.133
Don't affect our unsightly influence.

30
00:00:55.133 --> 00:00:56.233
Forget it, forget it.

31
00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:57.766
Another guy who looks down on people

32
00:00:57.766 --> 00:00:59.700
Let's wait for no one for this ad

33
00:00:59.766 --> 00:01:01.700
You must be immoral if you want to do this

34
00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:03.500
I didn't help you last time.

35
00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.233
I'll definitely help you this time.

36
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:09.900
Hey bro
