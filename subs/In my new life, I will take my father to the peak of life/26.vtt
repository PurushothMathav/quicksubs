1
00:00:11.933 --> 00:00:13.866
As expected of the venue of the Jiangzhou Chamber of Commerce

2
00:00:13.866 --> 00:00:16.300
The energy of this Li family is really a huge item

3
00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:19.133
Dad, your highlight moment is coming

4
00:00:19.133 --> 00:00:20.666
Are you ready?

5
00:00:26.133 --> 00:00:29.600
Song Yang, you are really a dog with a keen sense of smell.

6
00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.166
Chasing me all the way here

7
00:00:31.166 --> 00:00:33.233
Where I am is none of your business

8
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:34.766
Why don't you mind my business?

9
00:00:34.766 --> 00:00:36.733
I am already married to Yue Shao

10
00:00:36.733 --> 00:00:38.933
I am the young grandmother of the Ye family now

11
00:00:38.933 --> 00:00:41.600
Of course I care if you come here to eat and drink

12
00:00:41.866 --> 00:00:43.133
And you little brat

13
00:00:43.133 --> 00:00:44.200
You follow this trash

14
00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.666
When there is no food to eat, you will come to me crying and begging me

15
00:00:46.666 --> 00:00:48.100
I don't want you to care

16
00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:49.266
Hey you little brat

17
00:00:49.266 --> 00:00:50.666
Your skin is itchy again, isn't it?

18
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.200
Dear, what's the matter? There is such a fire.

19
00:00:53.533 --> 00:00:54.566
husband

20
00:00:55.166 --> 00:00:57.366
This trash, he came in and ate and drank

21
00:00:57.366 --> 00:00:59.700
As a member of the Jiangzhou Chamber of Commerce

22
00:00:59.733 --> 00:01:01.233
Drive him away quickly

23
00:01:01.333 --> 00:01:03.600
Song Yang, didn't you find out?

24
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.466
It's a mess.

25
00:01:05.466 --> 00:01:06.966
Let's find a pick-up

26
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.666
Ye Shao, who is this?

27
00:01:09.933 --> 00:01:10.966
A waste

28
00:01:10.966 --> 00:01:15.100
A big waste who paid for a scrap company

29
00:01:15.466 --> 00:01:17.200
Spend money to buy a waste company

30
00:01:17.333 --> 00:01:17.500
No.

31
00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.766
It's going to be that amazing company that was in the news the other day.

32
00:01:20.766 --> 00:01:21.200
Bar

33
00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.000
Did you forget to say it when you drank less last night?

34
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:24.933
That must be him!

35
00:01:24.933 --> 00:01:27.700
Spent 100 million to buy a bankrupt company

36
00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:29.233
Hmm, what a nerd

37
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.966
You might as well give me that money

38
00:01:30.966 --> 00:01:34.033
I can also praise him for being a good dog
