00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:01.466
How dare you come here

2
00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:02.500
Ye Tiancheng

3
00:00:02.966 --> 00:00:04.100
Why are you here?

4
00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:05.600
Ye Tiancheng really came

5
00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.566
This company must not be acquired by Ye Tiancheng

6
00:00:08.566 --> 00:00:11.200
You're not here to buy this company, are you?

7
00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:12.933
I really thought I had that billion

8
00:00:12.933 --> 00:00:14.600
Enter high society

9
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.400
You don't care what I do

10
00:00:16.466 --> 00:00:19.600
Then let's take a good look.

11
00:00:20.366 --> 00:00:22.033
Ye Shao, you are here

12
00:00:25.366 --> 00:00:26.866
You know what I'm here for?

13
00:00:26.866 --> 00:00:28.466
Received notice this morning

14
00:00:28.466 --> 00:00:30.733
Said there was a big man coming to buy our company

15
00:00:30.733 --> 00:00:32.933
I guessed it was you.

16
00:00:32.933 --> 00:00:35.600
Then hurry up and call your president over

17
00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.766
You are not qualified to call him

18
00:00:37.766 --> 00:00:38.766
Call us Mr. Wang

19
00:00:41.133 --> 00:00:42.066
Do you see it?

20
00:00:42.333 --> 00:00:44.466
You are not a stinker in high society

21
00:00:44.466 --> 00:00:46.966
Migrant workers can get in with a few stinky money

22
00:00:46.966 --> 00:00:48.933
You have to have face

23
00:00:48.933 --> 00:00:49.733
Song Yang

24
00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:51.266
If I were you

25
00:00:51.266 --> 00:00:53.400
I took the money and went abroad

26
00:00:53.533 --> 00:00:56.300
Your money as Young Master Yan is so easy to earn

27
00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:57.900
My dad's not leaving

28
00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:00.000
My dad is going to beat you all

29
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.366
Hahaha beat me

30
00:01:02.366 --> 00:01:05.400
Song Yang, what are you daydreaming about?

31
00:01:06.166 --> 00:01:08.333
Lijia took care of the lottery for you

32
00:01:08.333 --> 00:01:10.966
Do you think someone will still protect you today?

33
00:01:11.066 --> 00:01:12.100
What do you mean?

34
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.700
What are you still doing?

35
00:01:13.733 --> 00:01:15.700
Throw him out for me

36
00:01:17.066 --> 00:01:18.033
Stop
