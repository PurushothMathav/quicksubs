1
00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:01.800
Brother, why are you hitting me?

2
00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:04.400
Don't you know who Mr. Song is?

3
00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:07.300
Doesn't he have a few small bosses with small money?

4
00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:10.766
You trash! I told you so

5
00:00:10.766 --> 00:00:12.600
Let you stay away from the Ye family

6
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.000
You just wouldn't listen?

7
00:00:14.066 --> 00:00:16.600
Mr. Song is someone you can afford to provoke

8
00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.300
Brother, what do you mean?

9
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.666
Who can catch the trend of the next era?

10
00:00:20.666 --> 00:00:22.066
It's all up to Mr. Song

11
00:00:22.066 --> 00:00:23.466
Mr. Song's company

12
00:00:23.466 --> 00:00:25.733
Has mastered the ability to keep anyone in place

13
00:00:25.733 --> 00:00:26.966
Technology for takeoff

14
00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:29.000
How dare you provoke him

15
00:00:29.366 --> 00:00:31.333
Mr. Zuo, I'm really sorry.

16
00:00:31.333 --> 00:00:32.800
Made you laugh

17
00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:34.900
I'm used to smooth sailing at home

18
00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:36.200
Don't take offense

19
00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.366
No need to apologize

20
00:00:37.366 --> 00:00:38.666
My company's business is also very busy

21
00:00:38.666 --> 00:00:39.966
I want to know now.

22
00:00:39.966 --> 00:00:41.866
How to deal with this matter?

23
00:00:41.866 --> 00:00:43.766
You can deal with it as you say.

24
00:00:43.766 --> 00:00:46.733
They beat my daughter and the whole school has to apologize publicly

25
00:00:46.733 --> 00:00:47.566
Then fired

26
00:00:47.566 --> 00:00:50.700
And the autistic kid who was put in the hospital

27
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.500
The school must cover his medical expenses

28
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:53.533
And subsequent expenses

29
00:00:53.533 --> 00:00:55.266
Reasonable very reasonable

30
00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.666
Didn't you hear what Mr. Song said?

31
00:00:58.566 --> 00:01:00.166
Mr. Chen, you can't do this

32
00:01:00.166 --> 00:01:04.200
In front of the Chen family, your Ye family is nothing

33
00:01:04.266 --> 00:01:06.566
I declare your Ye family

34
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.300
All cooperation with our Chen family is cancelled

35
00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.233
Now are you going to get out by yourself or I'll find someone to get out for you?

36
00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.500
Mr. Song, are you still satisfied?

37
00:01:21.566 --> 00:01:23.166
I just returned to China today.

38
00:01:23.166 --> 00:01:25.533
I also know everything about yesterday's banquet

39
00:01:25.533 --> 00:01:28.066
See if we can cooperate.

40
00:01:28.133 --> 00:01:30.500
Chen Wencheng has a deep foundation in Jiangzhou

41
00:01:30.566 --> 00:01:32.266
If you cooperate with the Chen family

42
00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:34.400
The sales of new energy vehicles will be stronger

43
00:01:34.466 --> 00:01:37.066
Dad, Uncle Chen is so nice

44
00:01:37.066 --> 00:01:39.833
Otherwise, let's cooperate with Uncle Chen

45
00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:41.766
Thank you kid

46
00:01:41.766 --> 00:01:44.100
Uh, I'll bring you a gift next time we meet.

47
00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.000
Our company's new energy vehicles

48
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.666
It will be released on the 1st of next month.

49
00:01:47.666 --> 00:01:48.966
Is Mr. Chen still in time?

50
00:01:48.966 --> 00:01:50.566
It's definitely in time
