1
00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:01.866
He must be lying to you.

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.166
How do you know?

3
00:00:03.166 --> 00:00:05.633
His plan is perfect, isn't it?

4
00:00:05.733 --> 00:00:07.733
Mr. Gu, don't be deceived by him

5
00:00:07.733 --> 00:00:10.033
This kid has always lied before

6
00:00:11.966 --> 00:00:15.166
Mr. Gu, I am actually his ex-wife

7
00:00:15.266 --> 00:00:18.133
He was completely different before and after marriage

8
00:00:18.133 --> 00:00:19.866
Otherwise, I wouldn't have divorced him

9
00:00:19.866 --> 00:00:21.066
Think about it.

10
00:00:21.166 --> 00:00:23.366
A man who is not faithful to his marriage

11
00:00:23.366 --> 00:00:25.500
How can you possibly be serious in your career?

12
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.933
Wu Sisi, stop talking nonsense there

13
00:00:27.933 --> 00:00:30.033
When did I lie to Mr. Gu?

14
00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:31.500
You see he's still quibbling

15
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:34.266
Sisi, you slander me

16
00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:35.166
Okay.

17
00:00:35.866 --> 00:00:37.800
I don't have time for your chores

18
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.700
He lied to me. He didn't lie to me. I didn't care.

19
00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:41.666
I only care about this plan

20
00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.500
There is absolutely no problem with Mr. Gu's plan

21
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.333
If you say no problem, it will be fine.

22
00:00:46.333 --> 00:00:48.800
There are so many safety hazards in this flying car

23
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.766
Why didn't you write it in the plan?

24
00:00:50.766 --> 00:00:51.566
Xiao Qi

25
00:00:51.933 --> 00:00:53.266
Tell me in detail

26
00:00:54.066 --> 00:00:56.933
Mr. Gu's flying car safety hazard

27
00:00:56.933 --> 00:00:58.433
The blockage, for example

28
00:00:58.466 --> 00:01:00.466
What should I do if I encounter a malfunction during the flight?

29
00:01:00.466 --> 00:01:01.533
Suddenly fall

30
00:01:01.533 --> 00:01:04.100
What about the safety of the driver and passengers?

31
00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.000
How to control in the air

32
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.633
How to divide the flight area and so on and so on

33
00:01:09.866 --> 00:01:11.533
Xiao Song, Mr. Gu

34
00:01:11.533 --> 00:01:14.300
I'm not saying flying cars won't work.

35
00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.933
But in terms of current domestic technology

36
00:01:16.933 --> 00:01:18.533
As long as you invest

37
00:01:18.533 --> 00:01:19.466
at least

38
00:01:19.466 --> 00:01:22.266
It will take another 10 years to solve these hidden dangers

39
00:01:22.266 --> 00:01:25.000
The 100 billion you will invest by then

40
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.800
But that's a big level
