00:00:01.066 --> 00:00:02.300
Su Yang Su Yang

2
00:00:02.566 --> 00:00:05.100
I thought you really had a fucking 100 million

3
00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:06.566
It's a lottery ticket

4
00:00:06.566 --> 00:00:09.200
Do you really think you can win the lottery?

5
00:00:09.933 --> 00:00:12.800
Give me back the lottery ticket

6
00:00:13.566 --> 00:00:14.600
Little fish

7
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.033
It was this trash who told you a secret

8
00:00:17.333 --> 00:00:18.733
I'll tell you what.

9
00:00:18.733 --> 00:00:20.600
He will never win the lottery in his next life

10
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.600
You can eat and drink spicy food if you follow me.

11
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:23.366
Do you know

12
00:00:23.366 --> 00:00:24.366
Do you know?

13
00:00:24.366 --> 00:00:25.600
I don't want to follow you.

14
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:26.966
I want to follow my dad

15
00:00:26.966 --> 00:00:28.466
Even if dad doesn't win the lottery

16
00:00:28.466 --> 00:00:30.000
I want to follow my dad too

17
00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:31.900
This girl, why are you so ignorant?

18
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.866
What's so good about following this crap?

19
00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:37.200
Sisi, don't touch it

20
00:00:39.566 --> 00:00:42.433
Qin Mi Chang, I Song Yang can kneel

21
00:00:42.866 --> 00:00:44.200
But when I got down on my knees

22
00:00:44.666 --> 00:00:46.700
You promise you won't hit on my daughter again

23
00:00:47.166 --> 00:00:48.533
Cut the crap

24
00:00:48.533 --> 00:00:50.300
If you want to kneel, kneel quickly

25
00:00:50.666 --> 00:00:52.000
Dad, don't kneel

26
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.800
We have real money.

27
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.233
Is Xiaoyuer alright?

28
00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:00.466
Daddy! Daddy's playing games with people!

29
00:01:36.866 --> 00:01:37.600
Is that okay?

30
00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.900
Don't worry, it's not over yet.

31
00:01:39.966 --> 00:01:41.600
What else do you want?

32
00:01:41.733 --> 00:01:45.600
You're going to crawl around and bark like dogs.

33
00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.666
I'll let you go after learning how to bark
