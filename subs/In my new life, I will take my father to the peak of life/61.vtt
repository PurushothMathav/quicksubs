00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:04.700
Thank you very much.

2
00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.333
There was also such a grand welcome ceremony

3
00:00:07.333 --> 00:00:09.966
I say keep it simple.

4
00:00:09.966 --> 00:00:11.700
There's no need to waste it.

5
00:00:12.366 --> 00:00:13.766
Mr. Gu, you are welcome.

6
00:00:13.766 --> 00:00:15.166
You are the richest man in the building

7
00:00:15.166 --> 00:00:16.333
How can simplicity work?

8
00:00:16.333 --> 00:00:17.566
This welcome meeting

9
00:00:17.566 --> 00:00:20.066
It was co-founded by our Jiangzhou Chamber of Commerce

10
00:00:20.066 --> 00:00:21.266
Absolutely not wasted

11
00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.266
That's good, I don't know who you are, miss.

12
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.000
Mr. Gu, this is the general manager of the Jiaxili Group

13
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.166
It is also the current venue of our Jiangzhou Chamber of Commerce.

14
00:00:31.266 --> 00:00:32.566
It was the president

15
00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.266
Sure enough, you can be young.

16
00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.500
Hey, Mr. Gu's junior Qi Guangjin

17
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:39.900
We both met in Dee

18
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.466
Warmly welcome you to Linjiang Prefecture

19
00:00:42.466 --> 00:00:44.300
Qi Guangjin

20
00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:45.500
I've heard of you.

21
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.400
Your Qi family is the only century-old family in Jiangzhou

22
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.400
Right? A little bit of fame is not comparable to you, Mr. Gu.

23
00:00:53.966 --> 00:00:57.700
Of course, under the fame, there is no need to show off talents

24
00:00:57.966 --> 00:01:00.600
It seems that this trip to Jiangzhou

25
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.966
The partner I need has been found

26
00:01:04.533 --> 00:01:07.866
Mr. Gu, you are really a disgrace to the younger generation.

27
00:01:07.966 --> 00:01:08.766
Mr. Gu

28
00:01:08.766 --> 00:01:12.666
This is a gift from Mr. Li and I to you.

29
00:01:12.666 --> 00:01:13.866
And gifts
