1
00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:00.933
That's not possible.

2
00:00:01.466 --> 00:00:02.266
That's not possible.

3
00:00:03.933 --> 00:00:06.800
North America's richest man, Mark's new energy vehicle interview

4
00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:09.200
And ready to buy this company's batteries

5
00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.266
This means

6
00:00:11.533 --> 00:00:13.566
As long as we put new energy batteries

7
00:00:13.566 --> 00:00:15.000
It's used in cars.

8
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.500
We will become a building

9
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.633
The first new energy vehicle company

10
00:00:18.866 --> 00:00:20.900
This news is too timely

11
00:00:20.933 --> 00:00:22.900
Right after we signed the contract

12
00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.466
Otherwise, 110 million is definitely not enough

13
00:00:25.466 --> 00:00:28.100
More than that, as soon as this news came out?

14
00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:30.466
Even if the company asks for 1 billion

15
00:00:30.466 --> 00:00:31.900
There will be people willing to buy

16
00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.600
Enough Ye Da Shao

17
00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:46.800
It's okay, you can leave first

18
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.233
Next up is our company insider

19
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.233
It is inconvenient for outsiders to participate

20
00:00:52.266 --> 00:00:53.366
If so

21
00:00:53.733 --> 00:00:55.466
Please ask Ye Shao to leave

22
00:00:58.166 --> 00:00:59.766
You all wait for me

23
00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.866
Mr. Song has been delayed for a long time this time.

24
00:01:08.866 --> 00:01:10.166
I'll go back first

25
00:01:10.166 --> 00:01:11.233
Here's an invitation.

26
00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:12.566
Please participate in time
