1
00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:01.766
I want to use my 100 million cash

2
00:00:01.766 --> 00:00:02.900
Loan from the bank

3
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:03.733
What!

4
00:00:03.733 --> 00:00:06.100
The company already has some research results

5
00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:07.500
Re-creating a company

6
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:08.866
Take too much time

7
00:00:08.933 --> 00:00:10.866
I must take this company down

8
00:00:11.366 --> 00:00:14.266
They still look like a good match

9
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.266
We have a bank during our period.

10
00:00:16.266 --> 00:00:17.833
With our relationship

11
00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:19.700
I can loan you 500 million

12
00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:21.100
Pay off within ten years

13
00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:23.866
Annual interest rate 2%

14
00:00:23.866 --> 00:00:25.833
Then please underestimate

15
00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:27.000
Zeng Yang

16
00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:30.766
How much would you pay for an 80 million dollar company?

17
00:00:30.866 --> 00:00:32.766
Five hundred million. Okay.

18
00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:34.233
Lao Tzu accompanies you to play

19
00:00:34.333 --> 00:00:35.100
My night market

20
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.866
The group has tens of billions of liquidity alone

21
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.966
Do you dare to play with me with all your wealth?

22
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.333
Song Yao, you are rich now

23
00:00:43.333 --> 00:00:45.666
You take your money and roll it to the small county seat

24
00:00:45.666 --> 00:00:47.800
Don't get in the way of Ye Shao's eyes here

25
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:48.966
Ye Tiancheng

26
00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:50.566
You go too far.

27
00:00:50.733 --> 00:00:53.100
You're wrong.

28
00:00:53.166 --> 00:00:54.300
I bullied you

29
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.600
What's the matter, I'll put it here today

30
00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:58.533
As long as you stay in Jiangzhou for one day

31
00:00:58.533 --> 00:01:00.400
You can't turn over

32
00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:01.366
unless

33
00:01:02.133 --> 00:01:03.400
You got him

34
00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:08.100
Mr. Li, won't you interfere in our family affairs?

35
00:01:08.733 --> 00:01:10.233
Whatever you want.

36
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.100
Do you hear me?

37
00:01:13.166 --> 00:01:14.733
What about life-saving grace?

38
00:01:14.733 --> 00:01:16.733
Mr. Li will help you get the lottery money back

39
00:01:16.733 --> 00:01:18.466
It's all righteous

40
00:01:18.466 --> 00:01:20.566
Do you want Mr. Li to protect you for the rest of your life?

41
00:01:20.566 --> 00:01:23.000
Okay, since you let me not get it.

42
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.633
I won't let you cut your hands easily

43
00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.033
I said 600 million.

44
00:01:26.366 --> 00:01:27.666
You have the ability

45
00:01:27.666 --> 00:01:30.433
You pay more for the company

46
00:01:30.566 --> 00:01:31.500
Dad?

47
00:01:31.666 --> 00:01:34.233
I didn't expect you to have such a domineering side

48
00:01:34.866 --> 00:01:36.400
Ah Song Yang

49
00:01:36.966 --> 00:01:38.433
Lao Tzu accompanies you to play

50
00:01:39.866 --> 00:01:41.100
610 million.

51
00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.966
Get your people ready to cooperate

52
00:01:45.133 --> 00:01:45.933
Satsuki

53
00:01:46.766 --> 00:01:48.200
Dad tried his best

54
00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.966
Aunt Li

55
00:01:49.966 --> 00:01:53.066
Can you lend me and dad some more money?

56
00:01:56.066 --> 00:01:57.566
That's not possible.
