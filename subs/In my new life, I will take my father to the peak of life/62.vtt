1
00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:01.233
Here it is.

2
00:00:02.333 --> 00:00:04.600
Song Yang, what do you mean?

3
00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:07.666
Just fool Mr. Gu with a tattered pendant

4
00:00:07.766 --> 00:00:10.166
Jade pendant of this quality.

5
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.200
100 yuan can buy a lot at the stall

6
00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.366
No one wants the free junk.

7
00:00:15.366 --> 00:00:17.233
You dare to take it out and embarrass yourself

8
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.600
Who? What's going on?

9
00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:22.766
Don't worry for a while, Sun Yang.

10
00:00:23.266 --> 00:00:25.966
You let Xincheng spend 50 million to buy the value

11
00:00:25.966 --> 00:00:27.800
Tens of billions of best dragon stone species

12
00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.700
Why don't you take it out?

13
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:32.566
Take a junk and give it to Mr. Gu

14
00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.500
You don't take Mr. Gu seriously, do you?

15
00:00:36.133 --> 00:00:37.466
The best dragon is a species

16
00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:41.200
The last time I saw it was three or four years ago

17
00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.633
The best in the world that even I didn't get

18
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.700
Really with you

19
00:00:45.866 --> 00:00:49.266
Mr. Gu, the piece you are holding is

20
00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:51.500
Pardon me?

21
00:00:52.466 --> 00:00:55.000
Song Yang also has a limit for lying

22
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.266
Is Mr. Gu here to accompany you in a play?

23
00:00:57.266 --> 00:00:58.166
I see.

24
00:00:58.166 --> 00:01:01.500
He has damaged the best dragon seed.

25
00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.966
Just used this junk to pretend

26
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:06.600
Mr. Gu, please hold this pendant.

27
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.266
This little brother

28
00:01:08.666 --> 00:01:10.600
Could it be that you are taking the account?

29
00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.600
Xiong Happy Mr. Gu

30
00:01:12.866 --> 00:01:13.966
This pendant

31
00:01:14.266 --> 00:01:16.566
It is processed by me with the best dragon stone seeds.

32
00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.700
It's just that a little unique craftsmanship is added to it.

33
00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.266
In the case of being held

34
00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:22.900
Will become beautiful

35
00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:24.666
Usually

36
00:01:24.666 --> 00:01:26.400
It looks like an ordinary piece of jade.

37
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.700
Song Yang, don't you know?

38
00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.000
Our Qi family is in the jade business, right?

39
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.566
Where in the world is there such technology?

40
00:01:33.966 --> 00:01:35.300
Banmen get axes

41
00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.233
Why doesn't Mr. Gu have a ceremony?

42
00:01:37.266 --> 00:01:38.466
if not

43
00:01:38.466 --> 00:01:40.400
It's not too late to blame the juniors again.

44
00:01:40.466 --> 00:01:43.500
If he doesn't act like you say

45
00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.866
You should know the consequences.
