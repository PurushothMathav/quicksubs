00:00:00.533 --> 00:00:02.100
I have a total of more than 200 yuan

2
00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.633
I'll give you enough to pay for your clothes.

3
00:00:06.066 --> 00:00:08.466
Dad can't give him the lottery ticket.

4
00:00:17.066 --> 00:00:18.666
Why are you still begging?

5
00:00:18.666 --> 00:00:20.900
Manager Li, don't go too far

6
00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.766
Also towards you, what are you doing?

7
00:00:38.766 --> 00:00:40.100
I'll tell you what.

8
00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.533
This dress is worth 500,000

9
00:00:42.533 --> 00:00:43.700
Can you afford it?

10
00:00:44.666 --> 00:00:47.466
500,000 don't talk like a lion

11
00:00:47.566 --> 00:00:48.933
lion's mouth

12
00:00:48.933 --> 00:00:51.100
You haven't seen the world of dog things

13
00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:53.933
This is a French haute couture

14
00:00:53.933 --> 00:00:55.333
French haute couture, you know?

15
00:00:55.333 --> 00:00:57.366
You can't buy it with money

16
00:00:58.666 --> 00:00:59.466
Ye Shao

17
00:00:59.966 --> 00:01:02.100
What does he know about haute couture?

18
00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.333
Don't bother with him

19
00:01:03.333 --> 00:01:05.600
Why don't we call the police?

20
00:01:05.666 --> 00:01:07.400
When the police took him to jail

21
00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.766
This daughter just happens to have custody, right?

22
00:01:10.866 --> 00:01:11.666
beat to death

23
00:01:12.366 --> 00:01:13.666
What am I afraid of?

24
00:01:13.666 --> 00:01:14.633
You trash

25
00:01:14.666 --> 00:01:16.300
You dare to play in front of the old lady

26
00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:17.333
I'll call the police now.

27
00:01:17.333 --> 00:01:19.066
Hey, what's the hurry?

28
00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.866
Lao Tzu is very merciful today and gives you two options.

29
00:01:23.133 --> 00:01:25.933
Either you kneel down and kowtow to me and apologize

30
00:01:25.933 --> 00:01:26.733
or

31
00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:28.466
Take your daughter

32
00:01:29.566 --> 00:01:30.366
drop
