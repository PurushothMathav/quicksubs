00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.833
Eight billion.

2
00:00:02.966 --> 00:00:04.033
That's not possible.

3
00:00:04.133 --> 00:00:05.600
That's impossible.

4
00:00:05.766 --> 00:00:07.200
This is unbearable.

5
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.666
The show is yet to come

6
00:00:08.666 --> 00:00:09.766
Eight billion.

7
00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:12.866
Lao Tzu's 800 million is so fucking wasted

8
00:00:12.866 --> 00:00:15.166
Reporter Lao Tzu fucking crippled you old bastard

9
00:00:15.166 --> 00:00:18.166
Forgive me and say I was wrong. Go away

10
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.900
Ah lost, lost

11
00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:26.900
What's wrong, little fish?

12
00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:31.566
Good for you.

13
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.300
How much is that stone?

14
00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:35.200
No. 28 rough stone

15
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.466
The starting price is 50 million

16
00:00:36.533 --> 00:00:37.266
sheriff

17
00:00:37.266 --> 00:00:40.500
This stone is the best of all rough stones

18
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.966
There are at least tens of billions of pre-approvals in it.

19
00:00:42.966 --> 00:00:46.100
Hercules Group bids 50 million

20
00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.433
Try riding a non-competitor

21
00:00:48.733 --> 00:00:52.433
The dog is going out, how do you care how to ride it?

22
00:00:52.733 --> 00:00:54.333
I'm kind enough to remind you

23
00:00:54.333 --> 00:00:56.600
If you grab this stone

24
00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.300
Your previous 800 million will all come back.

25
00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.766
Do you think this young master is stupid?

26
00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:05.600
The same pit master will not fall twice
