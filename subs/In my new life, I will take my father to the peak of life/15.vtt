00:00:00.533 --> 00:00:01.500
Pardon me?

2
00:00:01.733 --> 00:00:03.166
You are a blind thing

3
00:00:03.166 --> 00:00:04.766
What trouble did you cause me outside?

4
00:00:04.766 --> 00:00:06.166
I'm not bothering anyone

5
00:00:06.166 --> 00:00:07.366
Didn't mess with anyone

6
00:00:07.366 --> 00:00:08.900
Then why is the Li Group

7
00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:10.266
It was suddenly cancelled yesterday.

8
00:00:10.266 --> 00:00:11.000
Reference order

9
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.733
He also said that he would never cooperate with us again

10
00:00:13.733 --> 00:00:15.100
I don't know.

11
00:00:15.166 --> 00:00:16.800
Hurry up and solve this matter for me.

12
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.833
Otherwise don't come back

13
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.800
How is Mr. Ye?

14
00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:21.700
Miss Li

15
00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:23.833
Mr. Li, I will never exist

16
00:00:23.866 --> 00:00:26.466
I'm blind, you take me for a fart

17
00:00:26.466 --> 00:00:27.800
Can you let me go?

18
00:00:29.133 --> 00:00:30.633
My dad will kill me

19
00:00:32.266 --> 00:00:34.366
My dad's lottery ticket costs you

20
00:00:34.366 --> 00:00:36.133
Your little friend

21
00:00:36.133 --> 00:00:38.700
What did you mean by lottery just now?

22
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.200
Dad won 100 million in the lottery.

23
00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:44.266
These two bad guys ripped him off

24
00:00:45.566 --> 00:00:47.633
I offer you two options.

25
00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.133
Or give me the lottery ticket of the Komatsu brothers

26
00:00:50.133 --> 00:00:54.266
Either the night market group goes bankrupt in a week

27
00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.000
I, I, I, I go first, go first

28
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.400
Bank card to the account 100 million yuan

29
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.133
Okay now?

30
00:01:03.133 --> 00:01:03.933
Thank you store manager

31
00:01:04.166 --> 00:01:06.666
I will settle the previous accounts with you one by one.

32
00:01:06.666 --> 00:01:08.500
Get out now

33
00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:09.800
I'll get out, I'll get out now

34
00:01:12.766 --> 00:01:15.100
Finally got my dad out of his anger

35
00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.066
Don't worry dad

36
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.500
With me, a new life has begun.
