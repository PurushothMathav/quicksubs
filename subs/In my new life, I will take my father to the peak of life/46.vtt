00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:02.466
Manager Zhou, you are here

2
00:00:02.466 --> 00:00:03.366
This crap

3
00:00:03.366 --> 00:00:05.366
Didn't the poor guy over there bring it over?

4
00:00:05.366 --> 00:00:07.500
I was about to throw it away what did you say

5
00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:11.666
This junk belongs to the poor guy over there

6
00:00:11.933 --> 00:00:12.733
You fool

7
00:00:12.733 --> 00:00:14.933
This is the personal customized card of Lux Group

8
00:00:14.933 --> 00:00:16.166
Don't you dare call him ragged.

9
00:00:16.166 --> 00:00:19.600
How could this be Mr. Li's personal customized card?

10
00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:22.066
I'll take care of you later

11
00:00:23.166 --> 00:00:25.766
Sir, I'm sorry for your bad experience.

12
00:00:25.766 --> 00:00:27.600
I will serve you next.

13
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.700
I have already called your Mr. Li

14
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:30.900
He'll be here soon.

15
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.866
If there is anything, tell him.

16
00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:34.266
We're just here to see the house.

17
00:00:34.533 --> 00:00:35.800
Yes Yes Yes Xiao Li

18
00:00:35.866 --> 00:00:38.033
Take this gentleman to see the house

19
00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.966
At first glance, this manager is a villain who actually wears clothes.

20
00:00:40.966 --> 00:00:43.033
This salesperson surnamed Li is not bad.

21
00:00:43.366 --> 00:00:45.400
Aunt Li will come in a while and can recommend it.

22
00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:46.466
Make him the manager

23
00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:47.833
Only come with me

24
00:00:48.133 --> 00:00:51.566
Wait, Qi Shao, what do you have to say?

25
00:00:51.566 --> 00:00:53.500
Lijia's personal custom card

26
00:00:53.666 --> 00:00:56.566
I know there are only two in total

27
00:00:56.566 --> 00:00:58.866
One is in the hands of the old man of the Li family

28
00:00:58.866 --> 00:01:00.933
One pair in Li Qin

29
00:01:00.933 --> 00:01:01.866
So what?

30
00:01:01.866 --> 00:01:03.100
It doesn't make any sense.

31
00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.333
Does this gentleman in front of you have a good relationship with President Li?

32
00:01:06.333 --> 00:01:08.066
Manager Zhou

33
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.900
You are really kidding

34
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.300
If he really has a good relationship with the Lee family

35
00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:15.900
How can you come to see the real estate alone?

36
00:01:15.966 --> 00:01:18.400
Still wearing a lot of stall goods

37
00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.600
Manager Zhou, do you believe it?

38
00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.566
Manager Zhou, are you hesitating?

39
00:01:23.566 --> 00:01:25.733
Why don't you bring a betting card machine?

40
00:01:25.733 --> 00:01:27.466
Let him brush it and try it.

41
00:01:27.466 --> 00:01:29.366
I'd like to see it

42
00:01:29.366 --> 00:01:31.633
Why don't you dare to brush?

43
00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:33.666
manager hao zhou

44
00:01:33.666 --> 00:01:35.600
Why don't you get someone to get the card reader?

45
00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.866
I want to see if you really dare to brush

46
00:01:38.933 --> 00:01:40.933
Go get the card reader

47
00:01:40.933 --> 00:01:42.700
Yes, sir.

48
00:01:42.766 --> 00:01:45.733
You shouldn't have agreed to swipe your card for the sake of ambition

49
00:01:45.733 --> 00:01:48.866
Pretending to be a family in Jiangzhong will be a big deal

50
00:01:48.866 --> 00:01:50.066
You are still so young

51
00:01:50.066 --> 00:01:51.266
Just work hard

52
00:01:51.266 --> 00:01:52.933
There will be some achievements in the future

53
00:01:52.933 --> 00:01:54.000
Don't worry.

54
00:01:54.333 --> 00:01:55.933
My identity is the same

55
00:01:55.933 --> 00:01:57.600
No, they said no.

56
00:01:57.766 --> 00:01:58.633
No.

57
00:01:59.566 --> 00:02:02.466
Hmph, I'll see how I die later

58
00:02:02.466 --> 00:02:03.266
