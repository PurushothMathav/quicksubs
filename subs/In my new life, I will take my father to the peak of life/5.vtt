1
00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:02.333
I want to protect this lottery ticket

2
00:00:02.333 --> 00:00:05.300
100 million here I come

3
00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:11.400
Isn't this the richest man in Jiangzhou?

4
00:00:11.466 --> 00:00:14.166
If my dad could get along with him

5
00:00:15.333 --> 00:00:16.133
Hey

6
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:18.566
Dad look

7
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.800
Xiaoyu saw it and left quickly

8
00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:21.933
We can't believe that.

9
00:00:21.933 --> 00:00:24.166
If it really deceives us, we can't afford it

10
00:00:24.166 --> 00:00:26.700
Dad, why are you so heartless?

11
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:28.800
You don't accept me

12
00:00:30.333 --> 00:00:32.400
How are you, old man?

13
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.566
Just a bowl

14
00:00:36.366 --> 00:00:38.166
Boy, don't touch him

15
00:00:38.166 --> 00:00:39.333
If something happened to him

16
00:00:39.333 --> 00:00:41.366
Maybe how he corrupts you?

17
00:00:41.366 --> 00:00:42.666
People today are not like they used to be

18
00:00:42.666 --> 00:00:43.766
Even if he doesn't corrupt you

19
00:00:43.766 --> 00:00:45.266
His family won't let you go

20
00:00:45.266 --> 00:00:47.400
Besides, you still have your daughter with you

21
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.033
What happens to your daughter?

22
00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.500
Dad, this old grandfather is so pitiful!

23
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.033
Let's help him.

24
00:00:57.366 --> 00:00:59.100
Saving a life is better than building a seventh-level buoy

25
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.166
Just treat it as a virtue for my daughter

26
00:01:01.366 --> 00:01:02.566
He really dares to help

27
00:01:06.333 --> 00:01:08.633
Shaohua Zang, you saved my life

28
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.100
What did you call me?

29
00:01:10.166 --> 00:01:12.366
I will definitely repay you well.

30
00:01:13.533 --> 00:01:15.066
My father's name is Song Yang.

31
00:01:16.466 --> 00:01:17.766
No need to beat up

32
00:01:17.766 --> 00:01:20.500
Old man, please call your family quickly

33
00:01:20.533 --> 00:01:21.900
Then something happened again.

34
00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:23.700
Xiaoyan hurry up

35
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.833
Dad, are you okay?

36
00:01:35.333 --> 00:01:37.466
Gee! You scared me to death!

37
00:01:37.733 --> 00:01:38.800
Listen, Mom.

38
00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.100
This person's name is Suyang

39
00:01:42.266 --> 00:01:43.733
My wife saved my life

40
00:01:43.733 --> 00:01:45.966
This family must sign up well
