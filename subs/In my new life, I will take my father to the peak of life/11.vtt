00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.166
Won the lottery

2
00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:05.200
The lottery ticket you and your daughter bought this afternoon

3
00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.100
The bonus is 100 million

4
00:00:08.866 --> 00:00:11.400
This is the biggest award I've won in years

5
00:00:11.733 --> 00:00:14.166
What do you mean, 100 million?

6
00:00:14.533 --> 00:00:16.366
Why is there a problem?

7
00:00:16.466 --> 00:00:18.900
You mean this lottery won 100 million

8
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.733
Yeah. I got it right a couple of times.

9
00:00:20.733 --> 00:00:21.900
If you don't win the lottery

10
00:00:21.933 --> 00:00:24.200
Can I take such big strides and come to him?

11
00:00:26.666 --> 00:00:28.100
Really lottery shop owner

12
00:00:29.066 --> 00:00:30.266
Ah!

13
00:00:31.266 --> 00:00:33.466
I was almost deceived by you dog

14
00:00:33.466 --> 00:00:35.766
You are the actor Song Yang hired, right?

15
00:00:35.866 --> 00:00:37.200
Are you sick?

16
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.466
Don't delay my business

17
00:00:38.466 --> 00:00:41.066
I have to get the prize when the lottery is cashed out

18
00:00:42.966 --> 00:00:44.600
If this lottery ticket is real

19
00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.066
That dog thing

20
00:00:46.066 --> 00:00:48.000
Don't you want to be superior to others?

21
00:00:48.666 --> 00:00:50.833
What is the commemorative note for?

22
00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:51.900
What do I want to do?

23
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.966
I don't think this lottery ticket is yours

24
00:00:53.966 --> 00:00:56.766
And you, get out of here

25
00:00:59.266 --> 00:01:00.233
You are talking nonsense.

26
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.100
This lottery ticket is obviously me and Xiaoyuer together

27
00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.266
I bought it at the lottery store.

28
00:01:03.266 --> 00:01:05.266
You said you bought it, you bought it.

29
00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:06.900
Do you write your name on it?

30
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.400
Manager Yin, what do you mean?

31
00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.466
Of course, to destroy your hope

32
00:01:11.466 --> 00:01:14.500
Let you only lie at the bottom of society for the rest of your life

33
00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.266
You must stop being a dog to Lao Tzu for the rest of your life
