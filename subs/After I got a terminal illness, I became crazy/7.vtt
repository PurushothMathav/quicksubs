00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.020
How did you get up?

2
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.380
Is the doctor here to see you?

3
00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.340
No, I'm fine.

4
00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.940
You've already passed out, how can you be alright?

5
00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:30.300
Thanks for bringing me to the hospital

6
00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:31.620
I'm really fine.

7
00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.020
You'd better check it in your case.

8
00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.860
If it's because the money is not enough, I can give it to you first.

9
00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.500
How can I divorce my daughter?

10
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.460
It turned out that there was a fox spirit outside

11
00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:02.640
such as

12
00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:04.860
If you had already found your next home

13
00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.140
It makes me sick.

14
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.140
What are you doing here?

15
00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:16.480
Why didn't you make my wife sick because of you scumbag?

16
00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:17.700
Oh so good

17
00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.100
I got divorced when we were together

18
00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.220
Do you still have any conscience?

19
00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:27.720
I'm so mad at you that I came to the hospital

20
00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.820
You're still thinking about your paycard?

21
00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:31.900
You see, I'll pay if there is no money.

22
00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.700
You're still shameless

23
00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.200
Just your salary

24
00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.020
How much is left after paying off the mortgage and expenses?

25
00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:42.460
If it weren't for our family's break

26
00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.480
We're starving to death.

27
00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:46.140
Do you still want a salary card?

28
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.560
It's you who are our door-to-door son-in-law for a day

29
00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.140
You are all your life

30
00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.260
We will continue to save the salary card.

31
00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:56.700
In addition to paying off the mortgage

32
00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.500
The rest is left for my son to buy a house

33
00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.500
Ha ha.

34
00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.960
Ah!

35
00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:06.140
Ha ha.
