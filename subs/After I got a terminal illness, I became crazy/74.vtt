00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.020
Peaches forget it

2
00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:04.780
The boss can't just let them go

3
00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.540
I'm going to die.

4
00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:08.220
What do you care about these?

5
00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:10.500
But the boss should let them go

6
00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:15.220
Go away thank you thank you

7
00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:18.100
Let's go, let's go, uh

8
00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.660
Peaches, you can't keep a secret

9
00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.980
Boss, it's not his fault.

10
00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:30.340
It's us. We did the interview

11
00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:31.540
I see.

12
00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:34.060
So I chose to leave

13
00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:36.500
I didn't expect to be caught by you.

14
00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:38.100
You should go to a hospital.

15
00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:39.900
The hospital can save you

16
00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.020
What I told you last time

17
00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:45.860
How did it go?

18
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:48.200
Lin Feng

19
00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.460
Do you really want me to marry someone else?

20
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.380
Of course I don't want to.

21
00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.420
But I can't be that selfish.

22
00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:58.660
So

23
00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.980
If you don't promise me

24
00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:03.700
Let's go then.

25
00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:06.860
But Lin Feng

26
00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.140
I don't I don't go I

27
00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:14.220
I don't want to be a burden to you.

28
00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:16.900
And I don't want any sympathy.

29
00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.460
Because it will only make me die faster

30
00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.780
Go haha

31
00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:25.600
Ah!

32
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:26.600
Li Feng

33
00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:28.580
I promise you.

34
00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:29.740
Within 10 days

35
00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.900
We find people we can trust for life.

36
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.220
You can promise us to take care of you, okay?

37
00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:43.220
Hahahaha

38
00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.080
I'm going I'm going home

39
00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:50.340
Go quickly

40
00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.180
No, let's go home.
