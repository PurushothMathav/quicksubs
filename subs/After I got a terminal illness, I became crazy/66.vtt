00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:05.580
Boss, I bought your favorite sweet and sour ribs today

2
00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:07.720
Boss

3
00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:10.240
You've been here with me for a long time

4
00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:11.260
Go back quickly

5
00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:13.040
Are you kidding?

6
00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:14.580
What will you do if I leave?

7
00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:17.020
I'm familiar with the situation here

8
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:18.900
I don't need you to find me again.

9
00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:22.020
And you have to work

10
00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:26.180
If you ask for too long leave, Brother Youth will trouble you.

11
00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:28.740
It's okay, it's a big deal to change jobs

12
00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:31.220
You have also seen my situation.

13
00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.140
I don't have a few days left

14
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.420
The rest of the time

15
00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:37.580
I want to spend it myself

16
00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.980
But the old man left

17
00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:42.580
Or I'll kill myself

18
00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.300
I'll just go.

19
00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.580
You must take care of yourself and don't think about it

20
00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:51.280
Okay

21
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.780
Thank you for all this for me

22
00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.700
I want to ask you one last thing

23
00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.140
Don't tell anyone my whereabouts

24
00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:01.560
OK

25
00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.300
It is also a kind of luck to die quietly here

26
00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:17.940
Although lonely

27
00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.660
But at least it won't implicate anyone else

28
00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:32.800
Is there any news?

29
00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:33.940
Nope.

30
00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.940
Lin Feng

31
00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:38.860
He's just afraid of implicating us

32
00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.180
So he chose to leave quietly

33
00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.820
Unless he wants to

34
00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:51.120
otherwise

35
00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.540
He's never coming back.

36
00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:55.780
Can you do that?

37
00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.660
He kicked me and searched for him

38
00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:06.180
I can't imagine how bad his life would be without someone around me

39
00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.740
I have an idea.
