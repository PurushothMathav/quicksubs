00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:02.740
How is that possible?

2
00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:05.960
Groom, you are a master of Chinese medicine.

3
00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:08.820
And doesn't traditional Chinese medicine say that there is no cancer?

4
00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.360
The hospital said two days ago that he could live for two months

5
00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:13.060
How could there be only one left?

6
00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.060
I guess you're right.

7
00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.680
Chinese medicine does not have cancer hemorrhoids

8
00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:21.420
But I have eaten two catties of 70 because my body has been rejected.

9
00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.380
There's nothing I can do.

10
00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.260
How come?

11
00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:28.940
How can you blow

12
00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.840
brother-in-law

13
00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:33.740
Please give him medicine

14
00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.860
Maybe there's still hope

15
00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:37.740
It's really not necessary

16
00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.020
Tomorrow you go to the pharmacy to buy him some traditional Chinese medicine tea to drink

17
00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.100
Just say I kicked them

18
00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:45.720
Farewell

19
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:48.800
Brother Jie

20
00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:09.820
Let's go but

21
00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:11.860
He said he gave you medicine

22
00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.980
Qin Lao said that as long as you take your medicine on time

23
00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.280
Even if the disease doesn't get better

24
00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:19.820
Will not continue to develop

25
00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:20.720
Yaoyao

26
00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.900
You're really good at lying

27
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.460
How could I lie?

28
00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:29.900
I have a problem with my body.

29
00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:32.540
The reason why Mr. Qin doesn't open a pharmacy here

30
00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:35.500
If you don't want me to know

31
00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.900
I also want to be completely hopeless

32
00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:42.180
That's okay.

33
00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:44.980
I'm mentally prepared

34
00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:47.660
People always have to die

35
00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.420
Is it a little early?

36
00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.460
Don't say that

37
00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.020
We will find a way

38
00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.020
If you have a crush on me, you don't have to say it.

39
00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.060
Yang Yang still

40
00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:11.240
yang yang

41
00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.460
I want to make a request to you both

42
00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.680
You said if we could do it

43
00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:18.920
I'll do it for you.

44
00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:19.900
Exactly.

45
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.740
Soon I will be gone

46
00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:25.360
still

47
00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:27.020
You are pregnant

48
00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.960
Yaoyao

49
00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:30.940
You have an orphanage?

50
00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.580
So I hope you both find your partner.

51
00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:38.740
Can you do that?

52
00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.420
What are you doing here?
