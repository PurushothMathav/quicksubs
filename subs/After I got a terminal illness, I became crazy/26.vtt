00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.660
How can you not pretend to be pitiful if you are rejected?

2
00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:04.820
Want to kill me

3
00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:06.860
Come on, smash it here

4
00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:09.200
If you don't hit you, you are my fucking grandson.

5
00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:10.260
I'm going

6
00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.120
Husband, ignore this dog

7
00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:14.200
I don't care

8
00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:15.300
See what he can do

9
00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:16.800
No, we're not.

10
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.800
If you have the ability, you will kill us all

11
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:19.920
Really don't go, do you?

12
00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.620
Li Feng, don't give me a fierce look here

13
00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:26.380
Who in the whole family doesn't know you're a loser

14
00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:28.640
They want us to move

15
00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.000
Unless it blows up here

16
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.140
Ok, just wait.

17
00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.100
Hey, what do you think this kid can do?

18
00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:44.820
Still as difficult as ever

19
00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.280
As long as we stay here

20
00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.200
Lin Fang has nothing to do with us

21
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.260
It doesn't matter if you call the police.

22
00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.780
Who made us his relatives?

23
00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:55.040
Mom is right

24
00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:00.700
No matter what method Lin Feng uses, this house can't let us live in forever

25
00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:03.540
Hurry up master

26
00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:05.440
I need a handle here, please

27
00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:06.880
As long as I can lock the door

28
00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:08.220
Ok, no problem.

29
00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:19.300
What's that sound?

30
00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:21.720
It must be Lin Feng who wants us to move out

31
00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:22.740
deliberately take away

32
00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:24.900
I don't believe he will keep knocking

33
00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:26.740
Means of going to the countryside

34
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.160
I moved away

35
00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:29.140
You think beautifully

36
00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:30.620
Don't go out

37
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.580
Tired that dog belly

38
00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:39.300
Get real.

39
00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:46.900
Smash it, why don't you smash it?

40
00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.000
If you can, you can continue. Don't you like to live?

41
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.620
You can live for the rest of your life

42
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.880
That's all he can do

43
00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:57.100
There we go.

44
00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:59.480
This house is ours

45
00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.560
Hahahaha

46
00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:03.460
Okay.

47
00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:05.540
Didn't eat at night

48
00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:09.340
I'm going out to buy some good ones, but I can't get in hahaha.

49
00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.400
Gangzi brought me back a plate of pork head meat

50
00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:14.500
Got it?

51
00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:16.380
Good son-in-law

52
00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.260
Lin Feng's son of a bitch locked the door with an iron chain. Lin Feng

53
00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:27.680
Lin Feng
