00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.980
Still, you divorced Lin Feng, what are you doing here?

2
00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:07.300
Yo, this fox spirit is actually there

3
00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:11.320
Mom and Dad, are you here to see Lin Feng for something?

4
00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:12.560
Oh, there is something wrong.

5
00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:15.660
Together, the winery went to ask Lin Feng to help him alert

6
00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:19.320
What summer drunk driving hit people together

7
00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.780
You go to Lin Feng to jail for him

8
00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:22.600
Yeah, anyway.

9
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.260
He was also a brother-in-law

10
00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.060
Besides, your divorce is entirely his fault

11
00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:29.000
I'm giving him a chance to atone for his sins

12
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.360
Rescue sister

13
00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:31.760
Yitong is not married yet

14
00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:35.080
If you go in because of this, how will you find a partner?

15
00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:36.920
Anyway, Lin Feng is also an unemployed person now

16
00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:38.420
It's okay to sit in a well and go to jail

17
00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:40.280
Just sister

18
00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:41.300
Let me tell you something.

19
00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.580
Let him tell me how much our family looks up to

20
00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:46.740
Hmm hooligan

21
00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:48.440
Rogue, what do you say?

22
00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:49.700
Give me out

23
00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.000
You guys are so shameless

24
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.900
You shut up

25
00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:55.220
It's not your place to say

26
00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.500
Lin Feng, hurry downstairs

27
00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:00.500
Drive the same car to the scene of the accident

28
00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.000
Do you hear me?

29
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.300
Get out of here

30
00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:05.980
Yiqiu, what are you doing?

31
00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.340
Xia Yiqiu, are you crazy to drive us away?

32
00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.020
It was your brother who had an accident

33
00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.580
Sister, you can't turn your elbow out.

34
00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.040
I said I was going to jail.

35
00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:17.780
Parents have to live ten years less

36
00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:19.020
You listen to me.

37
00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.260
Hurry up and let someone surnamed Lin do it for me

38
00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:25.980
General, you are sick with him

39
00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:27.800
What's so great about being sick?

40
00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.340
It's not that I can't die

41
00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:30.860
Have cancer

42
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.900
Can't afford to die?

43
00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:34.320
That's not good

44
00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.580
Go to jail for me

45
00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.360
He won't live for a few days anyway

46
00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.780
Just wait until I'm in death row haha
