00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:10.940
Are you all right?

2
00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:14.940
Sorry cold wind

3
00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:17.940
Let you and Miss Xia make trouble like that

4
00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.280
That's a problem between me and Xia Yiqiu

5
00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:21.460
It has nothing to do with you.

6
00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.380
When Xia Yiqiu left, he said he would give you a big surprise.

7
00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.380
He's not going to cause trouble at our wedding, is he?

8
00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:32.300
Don't worry, Xia Yiqiu is not that kind of person.

9
00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.560
Although he looks tough

10
00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.700
But very few do very spicy things

11
00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.100
It seems that you still know him

12
00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:48.100
Hello

13
00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:51.900
It's me oh ok

14
00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.260
I'll go back right away

15
00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:55.460
Gee, I've got to go home.

16
00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:57.020
Someone wants to buy a house

17
00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:58.300
If the house is sold

18
00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.840
The kids can stay here

19
00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:01.140
I'll go with you.

20
00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:13.640
Mr. Li, I am Xiao Zhou, the agent.

21
00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.140
Please open the door

22
00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.140
I am you

23
00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.820
Li Fang, you didn't expect it, did you?

24
00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.660
Look at Feng Ji's call, it's our kid who made the call.

25
00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.180
Do you know each other?

26
00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:35.620
What is knowing

27
00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.680
This is my house, you have nothing to do here

28
00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:39.620
Go away

29
00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:41.020
Good Xiao Zhou

30
00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.140
You can go back first, the house will be left with you, and the wheat will continue to be hung.

31
00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:45.380
Don't hang up again

32
00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:47.360
This is my bun.

33
00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:48.620
If you dare again

34
00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.460
When I go back to your house, I will live at your house

35
00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.860
You shut up

36
00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:57.800
Mr. Lin, I'll go first, and come to me when your assistant is done with the family affairs.

37
00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:58.620
Excuse me.

38
00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:02.680
Are you finished?

39
00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.340
Can Li Feng really do it?

40
00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.220
Kick us out and sell the house immediately

41
00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:09.860
If you guessed correctly

42
00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.940
Do you want to give money to this woman?

43
00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:16.780
It's worse than pigs and dogs

44
00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.780
We just lost your money, mister

45
00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.980
Now you want to sell your house to raise this fox

46
00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:24.380
I'll tell you what.

47
00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.860
What can I do without me?

48
00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:28.760
The house is mine

49
00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.580
I can deal with it however I want.

50
00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:32.420
Get the hell out of here

51
00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:33.780
Don't be polite to me

52
00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:39.700
What if you're welcome?

53
00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.540
Don't you want to sell the house?

54
00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.200
I'll see what you do.

55
00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.820
How to smash the horse head

56
00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.180
If you wait any longer, I'll be rude to you.
