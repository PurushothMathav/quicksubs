00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:02.880
What do you want?

2
00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:06.460
Xiaofeng, I know you are still angry with my sister

3
00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:09.020
I'm wrong about the house

4
00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:10.920
I apologize to you.

5
00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.220
You will apologize to me.

6
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.720
Are we all close relatives anyway?

7
00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:19.020
Because it's not worth making a house like this

8
00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:21.700
Now my parents and I regret it very much

9
00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.780
Get out of my house if you regret it

10
00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.540
Come on, we've already discussed it.

11
00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.820
Are you going back to your hometown?

12
00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.900
Mom and Dad want to have a reunion dinner before they leave

13
00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:34.980
Come this afternoon

14
00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.940
You would be so kind to invite me to dinner

15
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.100
I'm jealous

16
00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:50.660
I don't have much time anyway

17
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.820
I'd like to see what you have to say

18
00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:00.120
Deer, is this method working?

19
00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.440
Don't worry, mom.

20
00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.060
I have 30 bottles in this wine

21
00:01:04.719 --> 00:01:08.300
As long as he has a drink, he can sleep for a day and a night

22
00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.340
At that time, as long as he presses his arm

23
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.700
It's us under the guise

24
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.740
Will it kill people?

25
00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.060
How could it affect the hostages at most?

26
00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.120
They treat us like that

27
00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:22.160
It should be

28
00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.220
You deserve it.

29
00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.580
He deserved it.

30
00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:28.020
It's just a house.

31
00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.380
It should be given to us.

32
00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.040
He couldn't bear it first

33
00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.820
Don't blame us for injustice

34
00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:40.860
Lin Feng, you are back.
