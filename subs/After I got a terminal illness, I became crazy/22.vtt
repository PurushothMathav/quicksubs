00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:03.320
Order whatever you want to eat today

2
00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:04.420
Let me get this.

3
00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:06.100
Just keep it simple.

4
00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:08.540
Don't think about saving me money

5
00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:10.860
I just made a fortune.

6
00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:12.900
Then

7
00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.180
Have a chicken stewed with mushrooms

8
00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:16.820
Stewed chicken with mushrooms

9
00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:18.220
Oh, right.

10
00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.020
I don't know what you do yet.

11
00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:23.040
OK

12
00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.780
As soon as you came up, you asked me what I did for a living

13
00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.500
I'm not telling you.

14
00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:30.460
I hate to say that.

15
00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:39.780
Hey that

16
00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:41.660
That's not yours.

17
00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.500
Li Fang, you are still with this woman

18
00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:55.100
Does it really seem that this has nothing to do with you?

19
00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.460
Miss Xia, you know each other?

20
00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:00.220
He's my husband.

21
00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:02.340
No, brother-in-law

22
00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.500
How could you marry someone like that?

23
00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.320
But it doesn't matter.

24
00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:10.620
You met me

25
00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.700
I will definitely make you very happy in the future.

26
00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.240
Scumbag you know him

27
00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:17.540
Of course I do.

28
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.860
He's my colleague

29
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.740
To be precise, it should be a former colleague

30
00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.720
He is the project manager of the development

31
00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.000
And I'm the manager.

32
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.820
I fired him today.

33
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.740
You are fired yes

34
00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:34.400
But there will be compensation.

35
00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.100
Lin Feng, are you stupid?

36
00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.180
Unexcused absenteeism and compensation

37
00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.700
It's not bedtime yet, and you're dreaming.

38
00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.940
Why didn't you tell me about Lin Feng's firing?

39
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.140
Why should I tell you, Lin Feng?

40
00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:49.820
Be polite

41
00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:51.960
If you dare to face the lower corner again, it will be unreasonable

42
00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.020
Be careful I let you walk around

43
00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:56.960
What the hell are you?

44
00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:58.340
How dare you ask me to be polite

45
00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.740
Get away from me
