00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.580
The wind has been blowing for 3 days

2
00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.660
Can you still wake up?

3
00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:13.100
It's cold.

4
00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:16.660
A good person

5
00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:18.660
How did it become like this?

6
00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.780
Mom is here

7
00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.060
Mom used to treat you like that

8
00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:25.780
It's mom's fault

9
00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.140
Mom knows it's wrong

10
00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.580
I have always regarded you as my own son

11
00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:35.220
Please forgive mom, okay?

12
00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:36.600
He Feng

13
00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.020
Dad also knew he was wrong

14
00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:40.660
Don't worry.

15
00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:43.180
Wait until the autumn child is born

16
00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.260
We will definitely treat him as our own grandson

17
00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:50.940
Don't worry.

18
00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.260
Xiaofeng was a bad sister before

19
00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.380
My sister was blinded by her friends

20
00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.020
I just want to seize your property

21
00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.660
Please wake up

22
00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:04.080
Juanjuan

23
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.260
You are

24
00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.300
Mom came here today to apologize to you

25
00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.580
Sorry kid

26
00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.500
We bankers

27
00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.820
Let go of your subordinates

28
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.700
Let you do this and that

29
00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:30.340
Even if we're not satisfied

30
00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.420
We also took your bank card.

31
00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:40.940
Is an animal

32
00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:44.780
If it weren't for Changchun

33
00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.020
Then we don't know our pharaoh

34
00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:49.660
wrong

35
00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:55.340
Wake up quickly

36
00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.060
This family is falling apart

37
00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:02.760
Ah!

38
00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.420
Ha ha.

39
00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:07.980
You're finally awake.

40
00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.060
They scared us to death.

41
00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.020
There are so many people in the house.

42
00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.140
Our parents

43
00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.660
And my sister and Tongtong are there

44
00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.320
Baby, let's go to the hospital

45
00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:46.980
Can't you do this?

46
00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.380
Forget it at a glance

47
00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.420
I still have

48
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.500
Two Wishes
