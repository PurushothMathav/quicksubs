00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:13.740
Born born

2
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:15.580
Yixue finally sent it to my mother

3
00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.140
Hey, it's not yours, why are you so excited?

4
00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:22.300
I'm happy for you, okay? Hahaha.

5
00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:27.460
Hey, the child is out, oh, it's out.

6
00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:30.160
safe mother and child

7
00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:31.160
Who are the maternal family members?

8
00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:32.560
Come and give me a hug

9
00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:33.700
I have experience.

10
00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.660
Oops oops

11
00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:41.580
I'm a grandfather.

12
00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:43.420
I am also a grandfather

13
00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.860
You see, this child looks just like Xiaofeng

14
00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:49.760
Yes, of course.

15
00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:51.500
This is Xiaofang's son

16
00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.100
Yiqiu is our family's project

17
00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:59.460
When he comes out, I will give him this golden bracelet

18
00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.000
And give him 300,000

19
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.040
It's autumn now, I've quit my job

20
00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.900
We can't let him have any worries

21
00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.940
Hahaha happiness

22
00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:10.720
Where did you get so much money?

23
00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.440
We sold our old house

24
00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:17.460
And my old man and I got jobs sweeping roads, and we had a lot of money.

25
00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.900
Hey, a ball is out.

26
00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:27.640
One ball

27
00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.460
Hey, should we give our child a name?

28
00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.040
If you want me to say, it's called Ningxia. Not only does it have the surnames of Lin Feng and Yi Qiu

29
00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.620
Pretty smooth

30
00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:49.620
That would be fine.

31
00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:51.580
That's a good name.

32
00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:52.760
i

33
00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:54.820
I've made up my mind.

34
00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:56.580
The child will die

35
00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.920
die

36
00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.020
Although his father never raised him

37
00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.620
But there is the grace of fertility

38
00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.740
I want him to remember it forever
