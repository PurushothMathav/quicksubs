00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.160
Mr. Li, have you made enough trouble?

2
00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:03.900
What do you want?

3
00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:05.480
I swallowed it

4
00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:06.460
So many years

5
00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:08.900
I spent this money

6
00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:11.640
Next night

7
00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.120
I must divorce you

8
00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.920
Wu Feng

9
00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:17.460
You think about it

10
00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.200
If you divorce me

11
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.640
Then this family can never come back

12
00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:23.540
This disgusting place

13
00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:26.580
I should have left a long time ago

14
00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.380
Just leave and get a divorce

15
00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.400
But you have to get out of the house.

16
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.380
You didn't want to take a penny of the family's money

17
00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.340
Just my pay card.

18
00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:37.140
Give me your pay card

19
00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:39.420
You are our son-in-law

20
00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:41.320
The salary card should be guaranteed with me

21
00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:42.940
Why should I give it to you?

22
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.220
See you in court

23
00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:46.840
It's the other way around.

24
00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:48.020
It's the other way around.

25
00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.100
How dare you divorce my daughter?

26
00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.380
If she dares to do that, I will get nothing from anyone else

27
00:00:59.120 --> 00:00:59.920
bee

28
00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:02.780
What do you want?

29
00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:05.820
I said I want to divorce you

30
00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.420
Just because I made you do housework

31
00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.320
When did you become so melodramatic?

32
00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.780
I'm hypocritical, you get drunk outside every day

33
00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:14.160
I don't just want to pick you up

34
00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.260
And deal with everything you get drunk

35
00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:18.240
I let you pick me up those

36
00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.820
I don't want others to take the opportunity to enter

37
00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.660
I'm thinking of you.

38
00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.440
I as your wife

39
00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:25.860
Can't you take care of me if I drink too much?

40
00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:27.100
And what about children?

41
00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.760
When we got married, we said we wanted a child

42
00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:31.140
Six years.

43
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.160
You always refuse

44
00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:35.220
Every time I find a variety of reasons

45
00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.180
Do you want me to die?
