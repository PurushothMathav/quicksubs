00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:02.000
No conditions, who took it off?

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.640
Oh, don't be crazy.

3
00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:04.840
Don't be angry.

4
00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:06.000
I called the police to take it off.

5
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Then we can't starve to death here, can we?

6
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.740
Hey, come on, come on

7
00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:15.080
Yes, Xiaofeng

8
00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:16.560
We've already discussed it.

9
00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:17.920
Return the house to you

10
00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:20.740
We're packing up these two days and heading home.

11
00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.220
Xiaofeng said before that we were wrong

12
00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:26.140
Anyway, we are still a family

13
00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.140
Yes, yes, come and eat, let's eat

14
00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:31.400
The dishes are getting cold, right?

15
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:32.200
Eat now

16
00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.100
Our family hasn't eaten together for a long time

17
00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.500
Mom, I'm not really kicking you out

18
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.860
I just didn't have a place to stay, so I came back to borrow it for a few days

19
00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:44.460
If you hadn't treated me like that

20
00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.240
I didn't notice that it has developed to this day

21
00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:48.020
Xiaofang, stop talking

22
00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.300
Sister pours you a drink

23
00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:51.840
It's all our fault.

24
00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.820
Let all our previous unpleasantness pass.

25
00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.020
Xiaofeng, let's do it

26
00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:12.580
Oops Xiaofeng

27
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:13.880
Why don't you drink it?

28
00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.060
Xiaofeng, did you still send us to poison the wine as compensation?

29
00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:22.600
Xiaofeng, this glass of wine represents our family's apology to you.

30
00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:23.520
You have to.

31
00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.280
Yeah, dad's got a point

32
00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:26.780
I'm just weird

33
00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.000
Why is all your wine pre-poured?

34
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.420
I fell last.

35
00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:32.900
and

36
00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.220
The bottle is full

37
00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.540
That means you're not drinking this bottle at all

38
00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.580
Did you do something to me?
