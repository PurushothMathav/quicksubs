00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:05.500
Lin Feng, you are in love with Yaoyao

2
00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:08.220
Ah yes, we're in love.

3
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.060
Lin Feng, you are a family man, you are running around outside

4
00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:14.660
Your character is so inferior

5
00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:16.900
The company needs to reconsider you

6
00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.440
Yaoyao, don't force this scumbag to deceive you

7
00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:21.580
Lin Feng has divorced his wife

8
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.220
And even if he has a family

9
00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:27.260
I don't mind being with him either

10
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.800
It's my own business, it's my freedom.

11
00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.340
You can't control you.

12
00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:34.900
Mr. Li, what do you say?

13
00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.180
I like Yaoyao very much.

14
00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.780
Lin Feng, you have the guts, let's see

15
00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.260
Thank you just now for helping me out

16
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:55.660
Went to the supermarket

17
00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.500
Then you offended your immediate supervisor.

18
00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.900
It's okay, I don't care about anything right now

19
00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.700
Then I'll treat you to dinner.

20
00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:07.220
It's my treat.

21
00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.820
But I have to go to my mom's place later. I have to find a place to stay

22
00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:13.720
OK

23
00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:16.400
Why don't we leave a contact information?

24
00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.100
Wait, I'll contact you.

25
00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.060
Why are you back?

26
00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:43.320
Dad?

27
00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:45.980
I'm staying at his house for a while

28
00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:51.620
What's up?

29
00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.860
I divorced Hero.

30
00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:57.580
Are you divorced?
