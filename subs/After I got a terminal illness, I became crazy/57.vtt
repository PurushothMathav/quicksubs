00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:01.240
Don't let it go

2
00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:03.340
Do you want to give up?

3
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.780
Don't let me be like this

4
00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:09.020
Do you know that no one wants you?

5
00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:10.560
Don't let it go

6
00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:12.580
Excuse me.

7
00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:18.300
I shouldn't have treated you like that, but I shouldn't have believed you.

8
00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.660
This is all my fault.

9
00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.740
Let you forgive me, okay?

10
00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:27.420
I've found a ghost doctor who says he can cure you

11
00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:29.740
You are really pregnant

12
00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:34.500
unexpected

13
00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.800
I'm dying to have a baby

14
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.780
God is really kidding?

15
00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:43.580
The rest in the future

16
00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.380
Of course they will say

17
00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.180
This is our first child.

18
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.420
My current situation

19
00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:54.220
You know it too

20
00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:56.820
After the child is born

21
00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:58.700
I can't get a father's love either

22
00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.380
No matter what you can let my man marry

23
00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:03.700
Let him be the father of the child

24
00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:13.020
Life like this

25
00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.540
The way of the pick-up man is a bit shameful

26
00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.140
live again

27
00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.180
It can also be a challenge

28
00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.640
My girl, I will not marry anyone else

29
00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.980
I won't abort the baby either.

30
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.860
I would love to have time with you

31
00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.780
But I can't forget me

32
00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.460
It will be hard for you alone

33
00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.300
With parental help as well.

34
00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:45.100
Lin Feng, I beg you to say it again. We are too important.

35
00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:47.020
Say

36
00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:50.900
If you can't

37
00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.660
You can't help it as soon as your child is born.

38
00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:57.380
You must have the courage to live with determination

39
00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.960
yang yang

40
00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:01.380
The first good girl

41
00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:04.180
And it continues to grow.

42
00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.940
Still willing to never give up

43
00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.340
If I hadn't had this disease

44
00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.340
If you are still not pregnant

45
00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:15.780
I think I'll be back with you tonight

46
00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.340
Did you call me just now?

47
00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.860
Since it's boring to talk to that ghost doctor

48
00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:25.260
Then don't force it

49
00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.180
Let me go home
