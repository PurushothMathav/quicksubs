Our daughter is bringing her boyfriend back.

28
00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:29.280
Take a look and worry about you.

29
00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.080
Can I be in a hurry?

He insisted that we live in this orphanage

32
00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.300

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.020
This is my root

34
00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.500
