00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.820
I said that it is not the master of the Lin family who listens to the wind

2
00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:06.220
So he's not our relative.

3
00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:07.680
Not relatives

4
00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:08.320
Not relatives

5
00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:11.260
He has handed over all the money to you since he started his official job

6
00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:13.660
At least 2 million all these years

7
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.240
It's not a relative, he gave you this house to live in

8
00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:18.200
Rent the kind of house that is about to be demolished by yourself

9
00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.060
If it weren't for my uncle getting married

10
00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:22.060
I'm afraid he has to live there for the rest of his life

11
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.520
Are we raising him for nothing?

12
00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:27.580
Is 2 million not enough to repay?

13
00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.520
You even took over his property.

14
00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:31.300
What is 2 million?

15
00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.440
We raised him as a child

16
00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:35.500
Everything he has is ours

17
00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.380
Lao Yan, if you say so

18
00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.840
Everything about that mother belongs to you and grandma

19
00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:42.420
Why did you do this to him?

20
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.360
I know my uncle is not your biological

21
00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.960
But since you adopted him, you should treat him well.

22
00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.420
It's not exploitation.

23
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.880
You keep saying that your uncle is your family

24
00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.500
But I don't have the slightest affection for him

25
00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:59.700
It's a shame to have a family like yours

26
00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:01.700
What you did today

27
00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.100
It will be returned to you in various ways in the future

28
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:05.640
If you don't believe me, just wait.

29
00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.180
God will not spare any bad guy.

30
00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:11.280
Feng Meng

31
00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:14.840
Mom

32
00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:16.500
Before us

33
00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:18.140
It's a bit excessive.

34
00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:22.420
Several adults are not as sensible as a child

35
00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:23.780
All right.

36
00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.700
Let's go. Don't embarrass yourself here

37
00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:47.740
See laugh

38
00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.060
You have suffered so much over the years

39
00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:55.520
Li Feng

40
00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.980
Let's bring the wedding date forward

41
00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.340
10 o'clock in advance

42
00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.060
No, three days later.

43
00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.140
We're having our wedding in three days

44
00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.900
Li Feng, I can't wait to marry you
