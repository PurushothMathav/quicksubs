00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:21.260
It's getting worse.

2
00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:23.780
Not yet.

3
00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.580
Isn't this a loach husband?

4
00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:52.940
Why is he waiting for him?

5
00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.540
I'll take you to make a phone call

6
00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:08.240
Yiqiu, why is your husband getting an injection in the oncology department?

7
00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.740
What? He had shots in oncology

8
00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.660
How could he go to the oncology department for an injection?

9
00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:18.740
Is he there?

10
00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:20.340
Hey Yiqiu

11
00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:21.620
Are you all right?

12
00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.060
Tell me which hospital he is in.

13
00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:29.480
Doctor

14
00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:30.900
Where do you intend to go?

15
00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:32.500
Ah!

16
00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.180
You and I are going to really get cancer

17
00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:36.740
What cancer?

18
00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:38.300
That was his excuse.

19
00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.980
I told my grandfather to call me

20
00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.860
He said he saw him getting an injection in class 6 in November

21
00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.740
He already didn't want to divorce me because of the children

22
00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:51.160
I have to go see him

23
00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:52.800
You also know that you are divorced

24
00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:54.780
It has nothing to do with you what he has

25
00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:56.800
You can't do this.

26
00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.820
I can't think he doesn't care.

27
00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.740
He hasn't eaten well in the past two days

28
00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.340
I have to do something.

29
00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:05.260
So that he can have the strength to fight

30
00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:09.780
you

31
00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.820
Hey, this chemo is so uncomfortable

32
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.740
I don't know the spirit.

33
00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.140
I want to go out to eat.
