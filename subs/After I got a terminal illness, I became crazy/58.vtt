00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:05.540
The state ahead is getting worse and worse in the past few days

2
00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.060
He refused to go to the hospital

3
00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:10.620
I'm really afraid of him

4
00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:13.460
No more pleading

5
00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.920
You've run to the sunny side dozens of times

6
00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:19.820
He won't even see you.

7
00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:21.940
Just forget it.

8
00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.020
I'm going to ask him one last time

9
00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:29.020
If he really doesn't want to get a divorce

10
00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:31.940
Then I give up.

11
00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:42.220
Ouch.

12
00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:51.560
cold weather

13
00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:54.120
Now.

14
00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:56.700
Everyone, come and see!

15
00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.660
God, what is he doing?

16
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.940
This is the first time I have seen such a poor person in my life

17
00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.600
You seem to be pregnant

18
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.340
There are too many empress, you sit down and sit down

19
00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:17.080
Auntie, please take a video.

20
00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.140
Upload it online and help each other

21
00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:47.780
Please!

22
00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:41.160
Dad?

23
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.580
Can I help you?

24
00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.060
I'll find your next car in two days.

25
00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:51.700
Here he goes again.

26
00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:55.220
Didn't I say I stopped seeing doctors?

27
00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.980
Then let's go back, Dad

28
00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.580
Why don't you take a look at this first?

29
00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.180
Where does he come from?

30
00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.700
The place to shoot the video

31
00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:15.820
It's 10 kilometers away from us

32
00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:18.460
10 kilometers

33
00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.260
This girl is so stubborn

34
00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.620
Hey but my dad

35
00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.180
It's not your fault

36
00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:30.460
If mom adds another 0

37
00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:33.060
I must hope you hang a pot to help the world
