1
00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:06.580
These are my good parents

2
00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:10.820
Destroy your own son for your daughter

3
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:13.820
To tell you the truth

4
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.800
I have been fired from the company.

5
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.340
Make trouble if you want

6
00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:19.100
And

7
00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.380
You and my sister have to move out of my house

8
00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:24.380
From today onwards

9
00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.180
I cut ties with you

10
00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:31.040
Did you see that?

11
00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:35.760
This rebellious dog actually cut off parental relations with us?

12
00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.020
If you hadn't driven Lin Feng into a desperate situation

13
00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:40.060
How could he be so heartless?

14
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.200
Loach, what do you mean?

15
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.180
When did we get caught in the wind?

16
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.380
I know exactly what you look like

17
00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:49.900
I'm going to rest.

18
00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:51.540
Please leave my house

19
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.000
Go away

20
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.340
Don't make me do it

21
00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:04.700
Humph

22
00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:08.660
Who is this family?

23
00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.660
Yiqiang, your divorce from Lin Feng is the most correct choice

24
00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:14.840
That's right.

25
00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:16.920
Are you going on a blind date later?

26
00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.500
I've arranged it for you.

27
00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:19.560
Mom

28
00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:21.340
I always feel

29
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.580
What is Lin Feng hiding?

30
00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:25.060
The unspeakable shit

31
00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:26.800
From now on

32
00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.620
Lin Feng has nothing to do with you

33
00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.340
You have to pursue new happiness

34
00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.120
What are you doing, Mr. Lin?

35
00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:41.380
doing nothing

36
00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:44.160
I happen to be like that too

37
00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:47.020
Why don't I treat you to dinner?

38
00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:48.200
i

39
00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:49.760
Don't refuse

40
00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:53.500
I'll see you at Tea Tree Restaurant in an hour

41
00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:58.700
This woman is really domineering
