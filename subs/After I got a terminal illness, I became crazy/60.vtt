00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:04.000
Dad, is he alright?

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.980
It's okay, he's just too tired

3
00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.700
This kid has perseverance

4
00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:11.220
Kowtow so much

5
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:12.680
And she's pregnant.

6
00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:16.180
Dad, everyone has done it to this extent, so you can

7
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.500
Since the last time I gave your mother the wrong medicine

8
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.660
After his death

9
00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.460
I swore I would never treat anyone again

10
00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.500
Because I'm afraid of hurting others

11
00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.040
But this kid is too religious

12
00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:31.420
If I don't reach out

13
00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.660
Our ancestral graves will run away from the rain

14
00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:35.520
Dad?

15
00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.820
You promised to save her husband.

16
00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:44.900
He's asleep.

17
00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.540
You walk slowly to save him

18
00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.020
Qin Lao Qin Lao

19
00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:56.720

21
00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:06.020
Please, please, please take me to your house

22
00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:07.860
You promised.

23
00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:10.380
You also come to see the doctor in person

24
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.620
It must be a traditional Chinese doctor

25
00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:13.860
How is that possible?

26
00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:17.840
What kind of national medicine holy hand is the child?

27
00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.140
But don't worry.

28
00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.700
I will do everything in my power to save your husband

29
00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.420
Groom, can I be saved?

30
00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.180
It depends on your mentality.

31
00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.060
Psychosis can't beat you

32
00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:31.140
Leave it to me.

33
00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.300

34
00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:39.860

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:51.740
I came out to tell you about Xiaolin's situation.

37
00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:54.680
What's the situation with the clear ice?

38
00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:56.780
He was very sick.

39
00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:59.900
