00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:01.900
How do you know that?

2
00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.620
Look at uncle's eyes

3
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.540
The smartest

4
00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:22.740
Uncle, can you marry Yaoyao's mother?

5
00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:30.100
I'll peel off the candy paper for you.

6
00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:51.940
Yangyang's mother didn't want to leave you just now

7
00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.480
But Dad said my time has come

8
00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.420
Can't stay here any longer

9
00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:02.840
Really?

10
00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:04.420
Promise mom

11
00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:06.540
Don't leave mom, okay?

12
00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.100
No car that night

13
00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.860
They promise everything

14
00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.080
Help me take care of my brother

15
00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.860
Don't tell him about me

16
00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.300
I'm afraid he will be sad

17
00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:26.500
Good grandma

18
00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.020
Brother needs you to take care of yourself.

19
00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.860
He's used to having you by his side

20
00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.320
Mom, I can't take care of him anymore.

21
00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.900
I'm so tired I want to sleep

22
00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.860
Bhutan

23
00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:45.340
You can't sleep.

24
00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.180
Don't sleep Danny

25
00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:49.460
You wake up

26
00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.920
Dandan

27
00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.500
Can you leave mom?

28
00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.380
Danny, don't sleep.

29
00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:11.040
Dad?

30
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.320
Look at mom

31
00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:14.860
Wait, wake up.

32
00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:17.200
Look at mom

33
00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:18.660
Danny, wake up.

34
00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:19.980
I wake up

35
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.700
Danny ah

36
00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:25.100
Thanks Danny

37
00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:26.360
Dandan

38
00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.880
Dandan

39
00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.060
It may not be long

40
00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.860
I will also leave this world

41
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.980
Who will be sad for me then?
