00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:01.760
Lin Feng

2
00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:04.380
The sun is about to set

3
00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:06.120
Do you feel the warmth?

4
00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:07.580
Mount Rocky

5
00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:09.460
Although it is already dusk

6
00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.660
But it will still rise

7
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.140
A new day will come

8
00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.740
Dusk doesn't mean the end

9
00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:24.100
It was the beginning of hope.

10
00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:26.100
Lin Feng

11
00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:28.500
You're going to be okay.

12
00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:31.160
Lin Feng

13
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.000
Lin Feng

14
00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:42.380
He's gone now.

15
00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:52.760
No.

16
00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.620
He won't leave us so soon.

17
00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.780
He's just asleep.

18
00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:03.260
Icho is right

19
00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.140
He has not yet seen their child born

20
00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:09.860
How could it go

21
00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:14.460
He's just asleep.

22
00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:16.860
Let's wait

23
00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.540
Will he wake up soon?

24
00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:26.280
Don't forget.

25
00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.020
I've been accurate enough

26
00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:32.460
Please wake up.

27
00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:35.680
Lei Feng

28
00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:37.820
You wake up

29
00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:39.280
Lei Feng

30
00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:44.140
Wait, it's getting dark

31
00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:45.580
lightning cannon

32
00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:49.740
Wake up.

33
00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.340
I beg you to wake up

34
00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:55.620
Your child really misses me

35
00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:59.060
You haven't met our son yet?

36
00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:01.180
Mom

37
00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.260
Ah!

38
00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:06.940
You really are like this

39
00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:10.300
It seems that we should go alone.

40
00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.180
Neither can

41
00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.800
You can't just leave without a word

42
00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.580
You can't ah ah ah ah

43
00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:22.620
Uh-huh.

44
00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.100
Uh-huh.

45
00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:29.380
Mr. Li

46
00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.540
Hey, then he should have a premonition that he was in danger of a stalemate

47
00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:38.660
That's why he came to this Divine Peak Gate

48
00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.180
He didn't want to die alone in his home.

49
00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.060
Then the house will be affected

50
00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.420
Just before he died

51
00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.100
All thinking about him

52
00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.940
Earth

53
00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.860
Need

54
00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.980
I know you two are sad

55
00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:00.640
But

56
00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:04.820
But private is already

57
00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.140
We didn't consider the good things of the madman
