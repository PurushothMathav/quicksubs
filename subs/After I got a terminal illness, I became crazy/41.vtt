00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:09.860
I just want to scare you

5
00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:13.040
You hurry to the police station and make it clear before going out

Yu Meng, you are embarrassed because of the house.

11
00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.920
The big deal is that I don't have any ideas about the house anymore

12
00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.700
Can you go and pick him up now?

13
00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:33.620
I'd rather not have a house

14
00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:35.740
Let him sit through the prison

15
00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.020
Li Feng, don't go too far

16
00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:39.720
Why is it so noisy?

17
00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:41.220
It's all you slut

18
00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.300
It got my son-in-law into trouble

19
00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.100
I killed you.

20
00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.380
How dare you hit me?

21
00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:59.940
How dare you hit my daughter?

22
00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:02.620

Force the signature to explain if I call the police

25
00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.020
You have to do it too

26
00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:17.340
And don't forget that you forced me to sign a house transfer contract

27
00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:18.780
Two sins added

28
00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.460
Your sentence will not be shorter

29
00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.180
I'm not giving up on this.

30
00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:26.620
You wait for me.

31
00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:28.340
Mom let's go

32
00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.240
Lin Feng, we can't live in your house.

33
00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:32.460
You don't want to live either

34
00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.380
If you don't believe me, let's see.

35
00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.500
You'll never get the house

36
00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:44.620
Don't get excited oops

37
00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:46.540
How did you get out?

38
00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:48.160
Danny should be awake

39
00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:49.460
I'm afraid she'll cry

40
00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:51.100
You rest first

41
00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.260
I'll go. No

42
00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:54.660
She was late

43
00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.300
Then I'll go with you.

44
00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.180
Good to go

45
00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.400
Where have you been? Why didn't you answer the phone?

46
00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.580
