00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:03.540
What wish just say

2
00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:14.360
actually

3
00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:17.860
It's half the drink per person

4
00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:20.360
brother-in-law

5
00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:24.780
Stop talking, you'll forget the wine

6
00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.660
We'll talk about what happened later, okay?

7
00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:30.300
No matter how hard I suffer

8
00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:33.100
Boss, I'm here

9
00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.100
Give me a bite

10
00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:36.700
OK

11
00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:39.560
second

12
00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:43.740
I need to go to the toilet.

13
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.940
What were you doing there?

14
00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.340
I want to catch up with new ones

15
00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:52.700
Who says mountains are high?

16
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.820
Empty with your current body

17
00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:56.580
I'm afraid so.

18
00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:59.060
It's ok.

19
00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:01.740
I ask you.

20
00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.460
Get ready

21
00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.900
It will definitely make you feel the warmth of the setting sun

22
00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:42.980
What time is it?

23
00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:48.700
3:30 pm

24
00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:51.660
Let's take the cable car online

25
00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.900
It's about to delete me at 6 o'clock

26
00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:59.540
What about Liu Fan?

27
00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.020
He's at the top of the mountain getting ready.

28
00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:12.540
still

29
00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.180
This mortal is good

30
00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.300
You have to hold him well

31
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.180
Not big

32
00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.060
Don't catch a cold

33
00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.340
I'm all like this

34
00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.180
Afraid of catching a cold
