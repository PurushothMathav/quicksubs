1
00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.080
I'm not stable at the moment.

2
00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:03.620
Not suitable for having children

3
00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:05.500
It's not stable.

4
00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.940
Are you just afraid that the child will delay you from going out?

5
00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.680
Lin Feng, although I socialize a lot

6
00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:14.380
But I've never done anything wrong to you.

7
00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:15.760
I see.

8
00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:18.900
You just like the feeling of the stars holding the moon

9
00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.360
Because you are beautiful.

10
00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:22.400
Every social interaction becomes the focus

11
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.340
You can't bear to lose this vanity

12
00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.020
How can you say that to me?

13
00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.180
Xia Yiqiao, you know why I want children

14
00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:32.540
It's ridiculous to say

15
00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.260
I want the kids to tie you up

16
00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:36.920
Make you care

17
00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.100
Don't get drunk outside every day

18
00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.140
To be able to return to this home earlier

19
00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.580
Can you stop being so childish?

20
00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:46.100
I was naive.

21
00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:48.700
So let's get a divorce.

22
00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:50.700
Tomorrow at 9 am

23
00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:52.540
Bring good money

24
00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:54.060
I'll give you money.

25
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.180
Frozen, you walked this road today, don't come back

26
00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:08.160
Lin Feng

27
00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:10.700
Have you really thought about it?

28
00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:12.940
If we go in

29
00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.340
It doesn't matter anymore

30
00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.020
Do you have my pay card?

31
00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.180
It seems you are determined

32
00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:21.060
The salary card is with my mother

33
00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:22.980
I won't help you get it back.

34
00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:24.940
Get a divorce

35
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:32.800
i

36
00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.820
I'll give you a little more.

37
00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.300
If you come home with me now

38
00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.460
It never happened to me before that

39
00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:44.620
You must leave

40
00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:47.700
And so forth.
