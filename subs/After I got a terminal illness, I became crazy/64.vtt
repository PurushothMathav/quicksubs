00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:01.260
Next night

2
00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:04.020
How did you become so heartless?

3
00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:06.660
That's how you treat your brother

4
00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:10.160
He has today, and it's not all exchanged by you.

5
00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:11.160
Nonsense

6
00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:12.560
How did we teach him?

7
00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:14.540
He's 27 years old.

8
00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:16.640
doing nothing all day

9
00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:18.300
In addition to drinking, it is playing cards

10
00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.460
If you hadn't watered him

11
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.400
Will he want what happened today?

12
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.720
At first, Li Nuo scolded him as a waste

13
00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.220
I want to defend him

14
00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:30.020
Now it doesn't seem wrong at all

15
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.080
At one end, you're not just trash.

16
00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:35.980
You're still a top trash

17
00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.060
Are you determined to put your brother in jail?

18
00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:40.980
self-inflicted

19
00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.780
If you think I'm doing something wrong

20
00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:46.180
The big deal is that we cut ties

21
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.540
This is really your fault, sons

22
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.780
Go out, be startled

23
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:52.220
Ah!

24
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.860
For a dying man

25
00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.140
Have dinner with your family

26
00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:10.860
Not worth it.

27
00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:12.940
They've gone too far.

28
00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.460
The request I just made

29
00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:17.660
Can you do that?

30
00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.820
Li Feng, you know me

31
00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.340
I will not marry anyone but you

32
00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.860
I have no plans to fall in love in the short term

33
00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:31.580
You don't have to rush to answer

34
00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:33.820
Think slowly

35
00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.460
A little sleepy

36
00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:39.580
Go out first

37
00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.100
I really seem to be dying

38
00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:13.620
Keep it up.

39
00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.940
It will only be a burden to them both

40
00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:18.340
Instead of this

41
00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.040
Better to leave

42
00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.420
Quiet thoughts

43
00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:25.620
But before that

44
00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.420
I want to do something meaningful

45
00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:44.940
Feed peaches

46
00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:46.780
I want to ask you something

47
00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.180
Come pick me up at my house.

48
00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.180
I'm going to eat with him

49
00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:41.140
Lin Feng, are you awake?

50
00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:43.020
It's time to eat

51
00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:46.740
Lin Feng

52
00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:58.400
loach

53
00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:00.100
Lin Feng is gone
