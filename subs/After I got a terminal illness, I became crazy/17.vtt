00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:11.060
Boss Ma Qingchun's mouth is now asking you to go to the office immediately

2
00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:12.660
Got it.

3
00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:20.800
Lin Feng, don't you know to knock when you come in?

4
00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:21.760
Tell me something

5
00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:22.620
I've been busy.

6
00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:25.620
Lin Feng, are you crazy?

7
00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.540
I now declare that you have been fired

8
00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:30.620
Why should I be fired?

9
00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:32.900
You think you can do whatever you want as a manager

10
00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.500
In the past, this Lin Feng was very cowardly

11
00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:38.340
Why are you so tough today?

12
00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.340
Low-quality companies cannot tolerate

13
00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.140
inferior character

14
00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:45.900
Is this included in the company's rules and regulations?

15
00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:47.340
To talk about character

16
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.020
The kids are all in fucking high school, and you still molest Xu Yang

17
00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.000
The one who should speak the most is you

18
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.700
Lin Feng, you fart

19
00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:55.860
I have a formal relationship with the school

20
00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:57.340
I am the manager.

21
00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.280
I can fire whoever I want

22
00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.080
I'm telling you to get out now

23
00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:02.540
You can fire me

24
00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:04.460
But you have to go out and notify in writing

25
00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:07.620
How do you want to arbitrate me?

26
00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.300
Your little tricks can't fool me

27
00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.060
Check your attendance for yourself.

28
00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:14.340
6 days off work

29
00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.100
Just this one

30
00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.260
I have the right to let you go

31
00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:20.540
attendance

32
00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:22.700
So what do we see?

33
00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:30.920
Boss credit code

34
00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:31.840
Dare to fire you

35
00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.420
Then I quit

36
00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.500
Where are we going, boss?

37
00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.440
That's right, dare to fire our boss

38
00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:41.460
And that was that the color department was completely paralyzed.

39
00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:43.860
You heard him.

40
00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:46.440
This guy screams like he's killing a pig

41
00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:47.900
It's hard not to hear

42
00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.260
Actually, I'm here today to quit my job.

43
00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.580
But being fired by Ma Qingchun is exactly what I want

44
00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.020
You can also get compensation.

45
00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.300
But doesn't he always talk about attendance?

46
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.660
The miner he was talking about was actually working overtime all night so I didn't get off work.

47
00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:04.000
Ok. Mmm.

48
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.720
You go and sort out a copy of my overtime computer records

49
00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.020
And copy the surveillance video from that day together

50
00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:11.760
OK

51
00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.880
The compensation for firing me is indispensable

52
00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.260
The company will not take my youth

53
00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.460
I even made you bleed once
