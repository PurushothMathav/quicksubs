00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:03.060
What? You're divorced?

2
00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:05.380
Clear out

3
00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:09.100
Lin Fang, are you stupid?

4
00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:10.760
Your current salary is that high.

5
00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:12.580
You can't eat and don't dress properly and divorce him

6
00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:15.200
Forget the divorce, you're still out of the house

7
00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.120
That house is the loan you bought and you are paying it off

8
00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:20.380
Aren't you just torturing their family?

9
00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:21.840
We are husband and wife

10
00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.380
The house is my gift to her

11
00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.040
You are generous with gifts

12
00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.840
Why don't you give my house away?

13
00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.500
Mom, I have nowhere to go, I can only go home first.

14
00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.260
But I shouldn't be staying long

15
00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.200
Come back to live oops

16
00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.280
That won't work.

17
00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.540
Lin Feng, you also know that this house is a two-bedroom

18
00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.400
Mom and Dad live with our family, which is already very crowded

19
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:45.940
Where are you coming back to live?

20
00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.340
I'll just sleep in the living room

21
00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.360
Not even the living room

22
00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:50.760
One more person is more inconvenient

23
00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.540
You'd better go back to your own house

24
00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.320
Lin Feng, your sister is right

25
00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.060
Can't live at home

26
00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:59.700
Your house is 40

27
00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.340
I don't know how much more spacious it is than here

28
00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:04.700
Mom

29
00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.500
I just came back to stop for a few days

30
00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.540
Don't you just tolerate me like that?

31
00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.660
I paid for this house

32
00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:13.240
Lin Feng, what do you mean?

33
00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:14.040
Lin Feng

34
00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.500
So this is your army?

35
00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:18.600
We are all your relatives

36
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.580
Are you going to throw us all out on the street?

37
00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.620
You go home now and apologize to the hero

38
00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.000
Ask for his forgiveness

39
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.600
Even if he makes you kneel

40
00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:28.720
You have to accept

41
00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:29.680
Anyway.

42
00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:31.140
Where are you getting remarried?
