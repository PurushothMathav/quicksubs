00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:05.880
My heart is breaking more and more.

2
00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:08.020
Now I slept for a day and a night

3
00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:10.180
Boss is getting worse and worse

4
00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:14.460
Can we just watch his life go by little by little?

5
00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.380
He died at home just like Ling Feng

6
00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.300
We have to satisfy him.

7
00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.340
I haven't seen Ling Feng for a few years

8
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.260
How did he become like this?

9
00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:39.340
You're finally awake.

10
00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:40.700
Are you hungry?

11
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.980
Tell me what opportunity you want to eat

12
00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:45.860
Baby

13
00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.020
Do you remember what I told you?

14
00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.300
How could we forget?

15
00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.060
Li Fang, I never told you

16
00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:02.420
In fact, I quite like Tao Tao

17
00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:05.420
He would also like to be with me

18
00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:07.080
Yaya

19
00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:09.820
You think I'm happy?

20
00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.620
Okay, what Yaoyao said is true

21
00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.120
We decided to be together

22
00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:16.060
I will do my best to help his orphanage

23
00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.500
If that's the case

24
00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.020
Then I bless you.

25
00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.620
What kind of person is he? I quench my thirst

26
00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.740
You are happy with him

27
00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:36.700
yours

28
00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.540
I also found someone

29
00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.020
Can Leneng make you slow down?

30
00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:44.380
Do I know him?

31
00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.180
Our high school classmates

32
00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.140
Liu Fan Liu Han

33
00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:52.660
He can't miss me.

34
00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:54.820
His wife divorced him

35
00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.360
You tell him my warning

36
00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.900
He doesn't despise me

37
00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.060
Is he coming?

38
00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.900
Kite, I'm here

39
00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:07.820
old man

40
00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.100
Long time no see.

41
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.060
I didn't expect goodbye to be such a good thing

42
00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.140
Crazy, take good care of yourself

43
00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.660
You will be fine.

44
00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:21.720
Wife

45
00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.420
Accompany me for a walk

46
00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:26.980
I want to bring you home
