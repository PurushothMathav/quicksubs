00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:04.940
Chen Fan

2
00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:08.140
We are all classmates

3
00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:09.940
Don't lie to me.

4
00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:14.060
I'm still looking for you to act, right?

5
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.660
There is an element of acting

6
00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:18.300
But

7
00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:20.820
I love heroes.

8
00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:23.300
You like him?

9
00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:30.740
I have liked it since I was in school

10
00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:33.620
Still our school beauty

11
00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:38.220
I don't know how many boys stood up for him at that time

12
00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.100
Even now

13
00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.740
He is still charming

14
00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:50.260
It's just that Iqiu only has you in her heart

15
00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.340
We were all blocked by him.

16
00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.420
This time he asked me to act

17
00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:58.940
But I think so

18
00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:00.980
This is an opportunity

19
00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:02.980
actually

20
00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.380
It doesn't matter who you ask to marry again

21
00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.860
As long as that person's character passes the test

22
00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:12.700
Just be nice to him.

23
00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.340
If he promises me

24
00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:18.820
I will love her for the rest of my life

25
00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.900
Some things can't just be said with your mouth

26
00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.860
Lin Feng, what's wrong with you, Lin Feng, don't scare me

27
00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.860
Ningbo, hold on.

28
00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.660
I'll take you to the hospital right away, friend.

29
00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:12.500
You're awake

30
00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:14.860
That's great.

31
00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.840
Sorry.

32
00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:23.940
I was just solemn

33
00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:26.100
What do you mean?

34
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.100
Ah, I see.

35
00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:32.220
You are my character, right?

36
00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.100
If not

37
00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.840
I don't trust you with the hero

38
00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.140
Are you crazy?

39
00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:39.700
Do you know

40
00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.580
Just scared me to pee

41
00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:44.540
Before my villain

42
00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:47.220
But I'm curious

43
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.740
Why don't you call a ball?

44
00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:55.420
He's pregnant with a baby.

45
00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.300
I didn't want him to worry anymore.

46
00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:02.620
It just hurts

47
00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:10.320
brother

48
00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:13.280
overnight

49
00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:16.420
I'll leave it to you.
