00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.780
If you wait for him to come, I'll be rude to you

2
00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:12.280
Let me go! Do you dare to push me?

3
00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:13.740
I'll kill you.

4
00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:23.860
Wow, you're playing mahjong?

5
00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:25.320
Oh, my God.

6
00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.020
Linfu, how dare you hit your mother?

7
00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:30.460
What the hell are you?

8
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:35.700
Parents and wives have long said that children who are not supported are unreliable

9
00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:36.900
Believe it now

10
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.660
What to say

11
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:39.760
You talk to him?

12
00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.120
Things have come to this point

13
00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.620
What else can't be said?

14
00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.180
You heard it right when the thief let it go.

15
00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:48.680
You are here for your parents

16
00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.740
You won't be that kind at all

17
00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:55.900
So I told you.

18
00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.620
How could someone treat their own son like this?

19
00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.860
Beating and scolding me since I was a child

20
00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.620
When I was in junior high school, I stopped sending me to school

21
00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:10.260
I can only read while working

22
00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.620
And I'm obviously the only men's room in the house

23
00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.180
One asked me to be a door-to-door son-in-law

24
00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.260
Look at other people's faces

25
00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:22.660
I got angry at home and told you

26
00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.260
You say I'm not sensible

27
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.140
Occupy my house and don't give it to me

28
00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.560
I don't think I can live there.

29
00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:31.020
If you want to sell it, you can't sell it.

30
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:32.800
original

31
00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:35.940
It's all because I'm not biological

32
00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.780
Lin Feng's parents have nurtured you

33
00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.620
This house is a debt payment

34
00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:44.380
You gave us the house

35
00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:47.260
Then you don't owe each other with your parents
