00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:12.660
Eat slowly, honey.

2
00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:15.820
Let's go out and play after eating later, okay?

3
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.300
There you are.

4
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:22.640
Wait a minute.

5
00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:23.820
It will be fine soon.

6
00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:30.320
Come on, Songsong is the best

7
00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:31.820
Have another bite!

8
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.040
Yaoyao mother

9
00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.380
Danny can't come back, can he?

10
00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:50.500
Songsong, what are you talking about?

11
00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:53.460
Danny, he's just sick.

12
00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:55.260
Wait until he gets better

13
00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:56.940
Come back naturally

14
00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:02.900
Come loose

15
00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:04.840
Shall we have another bite?

16
00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:05.640
sweet mouth

17
00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.000
I had a dream about balls last night

18
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.820
He said he was with his dad

19
00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.960
loose

20
00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.260
Don't think about it.

21
00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.460
You are Danny's only brother

22
00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.660
He will never leave you.

23
00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.780
Since we don't want to eat it loosely

24
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.900
Then we'll wait until we're hungry

25
00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.580
I feel that Danny has left me

26
00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:46.420
Mr. Su

27
00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:49.180
He will never leave you

28
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.780
This child is a light brother

29
00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:03.740
Oh, his eyes!

30
00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.220
A darkness took away his cornea

31
00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.700
I've been trying to figure out a way to give him back his light

32
00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.820
But I'm really incapable.

33
00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:16.860
Is it because of money?

34
00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.500
And corneal donors

35
00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:23.580
maybe

36
00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.540
I can give mine

37
00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:28.940
Pardon me?

38
00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.780
Yaoyao's mother is looking for you

39
00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.260
Ok, go play.

40
00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:45.900
What are you doing here?
