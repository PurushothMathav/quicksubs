00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:06.890
Grandma Lin, your paper shell

2
00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:11.100
What's wrong? It's okay

3
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:22.370
Go back and chat. I

4
00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:23.330
What did I do?

5
00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:29.060
I was in Moments last night and you just saw it?

6
00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.610
Is it because I don’t have a wife that I have the patience to read all the friends’ posts one by one?

7
00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:36.580
I won’t tell you anymore!

8
00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:39.970
Who is it? Come back here

9
00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:43.870
You don’t know it? It sounds strange to me?

10
00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:46.520
Oops, are you thinking too much?

11
00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:08.360
Do you feel like a changing figure again? Chen Yun

12
00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.570
Are you talking about me?

13
00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:11.790
There must be something wrong with this

14
00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:14.760
You have to learn to be urgent

15
00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.620
you are my person

16
00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:18.620
You're not from the stock market, right?

17
00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:21.770
And I just want to see

18
00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:23.860
What exactly is this kind of thing?

19
00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.860
I attracted a pretty good kid on the market. You laugh.

20
00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:48.330
I'll give you three minutes

21
00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:49.570
Get out of here right now
