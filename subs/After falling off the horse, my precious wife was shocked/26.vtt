00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:03.150
memory.

2
00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:05.990
Can't remember.

3
00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:13.630
Shiri answered the phone.

4
00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:16.010
I feel so dizzy.

5
00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:19.520
Can you ask me to come and see me? No.

6
00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:21.660
Are you busy at the moment?

7
00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.700
Of course I'm busy. Busy with my wife.

8
00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:28.390
Dizzy, are you angry?

9
00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:31.030
I don't have any more,

10
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:32.900
I'm not angry.

11
00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:34.640
Really, really not angry?

12
00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:40.040
Not really.

13
00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.840
Itâ€™s good to be angry. He got angry and said he didn't like it.

14
00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:45.040
Show that you care.

15
00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:46.910
This is how I got to know you. I'm angry too.

16
00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:50.890
Dizzy, it's all your fault.

17
00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:52.790
The handsomeness fades away.

18
00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:54.150
seven degrees of extraordinary

19
00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:55.700
The three masters of soul and god

20
00:00:59.400 --> 00:00:59.840
This is so damn charming

21
00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.110
That phone call just now

22
00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:07.760
He is the heartbeater dancing today

23
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.120
Do you want me to explain?

24
00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:13.750
what do you want to explain

25
00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:16.350
Explain that you are behind my back

26
00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:21.080
The charmer who conquered me with his charm is actually

27
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.580
We have known Tingqi for a long time

28
00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:27.560
But I swear I'm

29
00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.790
It has absolutely nothing to do with him

30
00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.240
I can prove it with my hands

31
00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:33.500
You have known each other for a long time

32
00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.370
lose your phone

33
00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:39.290
Didn't they put him on the blacklist?

34
00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:43.920
It doesn't matter, I said

35
00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.650
I said not yet?
