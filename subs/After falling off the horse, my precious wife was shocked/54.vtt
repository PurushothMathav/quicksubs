00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:02.230
Why are you right again?

2
00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:04.470
Doesnâ€™t your husband dare to be surprised?

3
00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:08.150
My husband is very busy every day. Not as boring as you

4
00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:09.950
Looking for trouble. busy

5
00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:11.470
It's difficult to go downstairs

6
00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:15.010
Not your husband at all. Some people

7
00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:17.190
The heart is stronger than the sky, the life is stronger than the fullness

8
00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.930
Even Kâ€™s investors can use it as a treasure

9
00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:23.310
Pretend to be your husband. I advise you

10
00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.150
Work with peace of mind. Donâ€™t put your mind on these foreign media shoes.

11
00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:30.230
What investor? I understand you are here.

12
00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.710
what are you talking about

13
00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:32.430
I work hard every day

14
00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.090
It's you who's been causing trouble for me

15
00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.390
I'm looking for trouble then

16
00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:41.740
This is called looking for trouble

17
00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.590
Just to expose your lies

18
00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:49.300
Why bother to promise to send a letter?

19
00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.170
if i were you

20
00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:53.140
A Dong has come to this point

21
00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:54.960
If you still have some spirit,

22
00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.000
Now I'm thinking about this and get out of here

23
00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:02.950
What am I doing here? Chen Xunlinlong

24
00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:05.140
This is the people you manage

25
00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:06.640
Among them, I wrote for you, comrade

26
00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:09.290
Sorry, Lin Long said I managed me, right?

27
00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:11.030
How can I say it's him?

28
00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:17.740
How do you keep people talking to each other correctly?

29
00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:18.910
you're right

30
00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:20.600
I can't stand it anymore either

31
00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:22.510
Chen Ding just came out to organize justice

32
00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:24.390
Immediately give many long

33
00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:25.250
I made a mistake and persuaded with one hand
