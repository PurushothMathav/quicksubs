Saza,

2
00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.760
This is the little cake that Mr. Sun prepared for you.

3
00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.660
You eat a little on the ground first. Wait until it makes a joke,

4
00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:29.590
I'll come back and take you to dinner. I just know you wonâ€™t eat it.

5
00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.540
You see, this is the spicy strips I decided to bring you.

6
00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:38.180
Please let me go and accompany him first.

7
00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:40.230
I'll just use it. Ah, OK.

8
00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:42.400
Saza, that matters.

9
00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:55.140
You believe me too. Come,

10
00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:04.959
Just eat.

11
00:01:04.959 --> 00:01:07.370
not good. The next section of your rhythm was too sloppy.

12
00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:13.240
I believe it.

13
00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.280
Then OK. Anyway, this is a relationship about winning mistakes.

14
00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:18.140
I'll ask him. Always taken away.
