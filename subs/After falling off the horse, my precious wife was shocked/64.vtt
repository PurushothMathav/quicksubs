00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:08.750
Grandma, you are so kind. You are good too.

2
00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:13.560
Grandma, I feel that I am really lucky.

3
00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.320
Although I don't like bitterness,

4
00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:18.090
But I'm not too big either.

5
00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:21.630
I believe you can't kill me,

6
00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.080
It will make me stronger. grandmother,

7
00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:34.100
child. grandmother,

8
00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.730
Is it you? Should you go to sleep?

9
00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:41.620
Go to sleep. That's OK,

10
00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.040
Wake up more. Don't worry,

11
00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.150
Grandma, no. Tell you the time.

12
00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:48.720
You know you shouldn't like rich people.

13
00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.360
She insists that she is a rich second generation. Fool,

14
00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:54.680
Don't understand anything. grandmother,

15
00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:55.420
This is for you.

16
00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:56.720
Tommy, do you understand?

17
00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:01.090
The cio of the group comes to Tommy and you donâ€™t even understand rice.

18
00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:03.970
The best way to do something initially

19
00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:05.560
It's a head-on victory

20
00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:16.700
It's okay to have a dream here

21
00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.140
Just use me

22
00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:19.930
I want you to protect you

23
00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:24.200
Can you sleep with me tonight?
