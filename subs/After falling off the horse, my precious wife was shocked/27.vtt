00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:06.840
Did I say, I said it’s not okay, but you have to promise me, I said it, don’t you dare to be angry?

2
00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:19.760
You will be angry now. The blood is what I want. What? The blood is what you want. Do you see?

3
00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:27.440
Why don't you see that this person, Blood, the soul god, the poisonous criminal who kills people, how can he fall in love with you?

4
00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:32.680
Ordinary people without money, so after one month of dating me, he criticized a rich man

5
00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:40.530
Foreigners, I'm sorry, um, you mean, don't criticize me, right?

6
00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.920
It’s impossible to leave the country in the future

7
00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:44.120
He comes back with nothing

8
00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:44.820
I don't know either

9
00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.000
I don't know either

10
00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:48.380
Do you think he can work if he goes to the south?

11
00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:49.420
if i knew

12
00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:50.320
He can in the south

13
00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:51.760
How could I let you go?

14
00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.650
Don't act like it makes sense, right?

15
00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:57.290
The call was just an accident

16
00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:00.440
I have no contact with him for a long time, do you think?

17
00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:02.670
No one else dares to face it

18
00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.370
No more talking to passersby in class

19
00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.080
Who still remembers whether the phone was blocked or not?

20
00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:09.850
Then you're blaming me

21
00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:15.260
Blame me for asking you to innovate again. But you are tired.

22
00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.980
It's your fault, it's all my fault

23
00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:19.420
it's all my fault

24
00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:21.210
Can't stay single forever

25
00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:26.050
Until I meet you, right?
