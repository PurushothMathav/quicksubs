Isn’t this really your husband? Yes,

Assume husband. When will you get married?

3
00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:07.290
Why didn't I know? I made bubble circles.

4
00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:09.770
I've been too busy recently,

5
00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:12.350
I didn't even look at bubble circles. My husband looks really good.

6
00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:13.580
I fell asleep.

Well, have you eaten? No,

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:30.560
Let's have a meal together. Okay? Is this good?

12
00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:33.560
After eating, I'll pay the bill. You eat some fruit,

13
00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:33.920
Eaten.

14
00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:37.640
Don't go, I'll do it this time

15
00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:38.900
How can that be done?

16
00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:40.720
As a playing field for a man

17
00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:42.480
How can I let you pay the bill?

Da Lei’s money

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:50.870
This is money for wandering around the world

20
00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:52.330
When I had a job before

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:53.050
Lend out a lot

22
00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.600
Now we can only rely on collection to make a living.

23
00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:56.950
Where is your wallet?

24
00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:57.810
Just let me use it

25
00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:07.870
If you didn't get in, I'd better guarantee your show rate.
