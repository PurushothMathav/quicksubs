00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:24.800
Do you like it? Do you like this set?

2
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.990
I don’t like it! I think this is the set,

3
00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:32.810
Let me tell you, this friend of mine remembered that I had 20,000 yuan.

4
00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:35.610
You never paid me back. I don’t even open my mouth in all directions,

5
00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.840
Living here means that he doesn't want to pay me back.

6
00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:44.070
Mom, really? Thank you,

7
00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:46.950
Even awesome. You said it was the best room I've ever lived in.

8
00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.930
What are you doing here? I'm in the supermarket,

9
00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:21.160
Attached is the recommended Sennang, which one you take first.

10
00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.240
What about the rent of 20,000 yuan? I will give it to you when I make money.

11
00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.180
Gangbai takes advantage of you. I'm afraid you won't have to take advantage of me again.

12
00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:29.680
How can this work?

13
00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:31.360
It’s not easy for anyone to make money

14
00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.480
What's more, this is your wedding money and property.

15
00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:37.250
From now on, when you make money, give it to me

16
00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:38.910
as our family expenses

17
00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:40.510
Okay, go ahead and click on it.

18
00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:42.280
One is not ten o'clock

19
00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:44.120
So many times when supermarkets are closed

20
00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:46.660
Or just sell out all the milk

21
00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:48.860
But I'm not sold out yet

22
00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:50.080
So it’s usually ten o’clock

23
00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:51.760
My afternoon experience

24
00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:53.380
Don't come too early

25
00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:54.940
What can you wait for?

26
00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:58.870
Don’t worry, I’ll definitely be able to buy it all this afternoon.

27
00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:03.260
Then bye bye next

28
00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.800
Bye, hello, let’s arrange it

29
00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.790
It's pretty harsh for everyone to do that.

30
00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:08.770
Landlord, I gave you money
