00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.500
How about it?

2
00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:05.780
Don't do it. Eat quickly

3
00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:12.020
There are sheep again. lay down.

4
00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:15.500
What are you doing? Just do it.

5
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.400
Sorry, I'm sorry, I'm too new to my shoes.

6
00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:19.740
This is a quick-acting food,

7
00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:22.280
boss. You should eat more.

8
00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.810
Add-ons I made. Where is the bonus?

9
00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:29.830
Isn't this an added dish?

10
00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:31.650
This took me two hours,

11
00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.590
Learn how to do it from the tutorial on Penalty.

12
00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.480
What tutorial?

13
00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:47.590
Come and take a look. I envy every couple who never breaks up,

14
00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:53.580
I donâ€™t want you to eat like me

15
00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:55.160
let's eat together

16
00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:56.780
We broke up a lot after eating

17
00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:07.060
I know a particularly delicious walk-in restaurant

18
00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:08.600
You left just recently

19
00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:17.380
Is it delicious if I feed you something?

20
00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.640
Much more delicious than the no-breakup set meal

21
00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.200
I really thought it was Police Officer Zhao Erba's free lunch.

22
00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.480
I didn't expect that he was single and came out to deceive fools.

23
00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:29.580
You are just stupid

24
00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:31.290
I'm a fool

25
00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:38.880
There's no need for that fool to take you to work.

26
00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.100
My company is right across the street

27
00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:41.020
I'm going to walk

28
00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:42.280
I'm leaving first

29
00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:43.260
Tell me everyone

30
00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:43.960
Everyone, wait a moment

31
00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:45.840
You go opposite

32
00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:47.680
Here are two handsome pieces of red
