00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.100
Are you so rich? Let’s not get married, right?

2
00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:06.780
Not why? Let me tell you the truth.

3
00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:10.040
The gap between the two of us is too big. I added normal.

4
00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:12.930
I only have a few thousand dollars on me now.

5
00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.580
The two of us are together.

6
00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:18.060
The money and consumption issues are all different.

7
00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:21.000
And you must have a high quality of life.

8
00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.040
There will definitely be a lot of contradictions.

9
00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:25.500
Actually I think so.

10
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.740
In fact, my mother always wanted me to find a rich man.

11
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.700
But I just want to find an ordinary person.

12
00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.680
Let's live an ordinary life together

13
00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:34.700
So we are not suitable

14
00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:36.340
Actually I don’t have any money either

15
00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:37.960
This is me staying in the wind and snow

16
00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:41.140
Is someone else driving your car, right?

17
00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:43.520
That car is our old manager.

18
00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:44.500
I came over unexpectedly

19
00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:49.210
Is it true that he sent it? Is this right?

20
00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:53.130
Then let's go in and forget it.

21
00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:55.770
Did you know you were married early?

22
00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.470
You came out too early

23
00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:00.580
You're not going to sit there anymore and there's no one around

24
00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:05.400
You told me later let's go

25
00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:14.220
This is a collar, right?

26
00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.780
I'm going home first

27
00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:17.660
I'll take you back, no need

28
00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:20.220
I'm so lucky to have my heart here in half an hour

29
00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.380
half an hour

30
00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:23.660
No way it's so hot

31
00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:32.310
Is this how it was before?

32
00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.300
This is all the money I have

33
00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:39.740
Can I move to Drinks? Why?

34
00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:41.970
My house has expired

35
00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.280
Now that we have taken charge of the village

36
00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:49.040
Otherwise, let's live together, okay, let's go
