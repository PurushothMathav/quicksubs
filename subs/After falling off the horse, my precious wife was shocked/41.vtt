00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:05.550
Try leaving. last night.

2
00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:07.830
How are you? Are you okay?

3
00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:11.200
Is there any discomfort? I'm fine.

4
00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:16.860
What about you? Me too. I just can't quite remember what happened last night?

5
00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.740
I didn't do anything to get out of the car, right?

6
00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:27.370
No. But when you say you are very rich, you also say you are Mr. Sheng?

7
00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.790
Is it true? I really said it.

8
00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:39.680
Why did I talk about my dream?

9
00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:41.340
Madam, it's so embarrassing.

10
00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:53.780
Having dreams is a good thing. No. 19

11
00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:55.790
You are a new practitioner

12
00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:58.410
Is this how you get stuck at work? Hi, Team Leader

13
00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.130
The company stipulates that you go to work at nine o'clock

14
00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:01.950
I just scored 8.59

15
00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:03.170
Get to work in 59 seconds

16
00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:04.470
It has nothing to do with you

17
00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:07.780
You, donâ€™t think that you have changed your job

18
00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:08.940
I can't do anything to you

19
00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.690
Shen Yi, let me tell you

20
00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:11.570
this company

21
00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:12.390
I have the final say

22
00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:23.000
This is too powerful. These words

23
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.020
He's usually like this too

24
00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:29.400
Will he be honest?

25
00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:34.500
Is it okay if the investor is his ex-boyfriend?

26
00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.260
He dated me for about a month

27
00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.060
Just criticized a rich foreigner

28
00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.930
His ex-boyfriend was quite awesome.
