00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.770
I'll go first. He doesn't want to spend it with you when he has money.

2
00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:09.380
It's even more exaggerated. There is trust.

3
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.040
But if you pretend to be poor and deceive me, I will do it.

4
00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:15.260
It turns out I'm sorry. I won’t tell you today.

5
00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:17.700
Don't move. Don't wait for me!

6
00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:20.220
I invite you to come to your you. No, no,

7
00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:23.540
I told you to come over, but you didn’t bring me with you.

8
00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:25.920
I, I, am I just worried that you are busy?

9
00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:33.280
Take a seat. You,

10
00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.480
I care about you too much and am afraid that you will run away because of so much money.

11
00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.380
Did you and I choose you? Did you?

12
00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:47.610
Very powerful. You are cheating.

13
00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:49.650
Cheating is cheating.

14
00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:51.890
It doesn’t matter what I deceived

15
00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.060
How could it matter?

16
00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:57.000
If you just knew me and my sister

17
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.160
She will be more affectionate

18
00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:10.900
No, we start from this number

19
00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.740
I'm going to talk to you
