00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.100
You are indeed different from the rich people I have met.

2
00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:07.400
You've seen what rich people are like before.

3
00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.490
Let me play. I didn't hit all night.

4
00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:30.400
And it is just right to work on your own. I'll come back to you two nights later.

5
00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.210
A group of three hundred thousand.

6
00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:38.310
Really unhappy. If you are angry, please stop talking.

7
00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.660
I'm lucky. The rich people I met before,

8
00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:46.380
In this way, they have two pockets of money,

9
00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.590
Just bully people casually. bully me.

10
00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.860
Your grandma stops. Who bullied you. Grandma will take revenge on you.

11
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.740
right. I will avenge you too. fine.

12
00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:00.000
It's all over.

13
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.790
My business is good

14
00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.160
Grandma is rich

15
00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.790
Much richer than the average person

16
00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.570
Grandma, listen to what you said

17
00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.040
bank every day

18
00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:11.320
That won't even come out at all

19
00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:12.980
one by one

20
00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.240
Benefits of frequent deposits

21
00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:18.540
I also protect my money and go out for a piece of miscellaneous money

22
00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.980
Grandma, you are so kind
