00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:03.430
Life, I will do it myself. You are truly a husband.

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:16.059
Old man, I can recognize you. Is it possible now?

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:47.720
Now a mode allows you to do more.

8
00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:50.500
But you can go to me in person.

11
00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:57.740
What to say. I ran away because of you thirty years ago.

12
00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:59.280
Your disciple is the emperor of stick things.

13
00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:01.100
This time it’s the Wang family

14
00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:02.520
Willing to contribute 300,000 yuan

15
00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:03.680
You have to marry me back no matter what you say.

16
00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:05.110
When you get the money

17
00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:06.190
Let me talk to you

18
00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:07.610

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:08.450
For your wedding

20
00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:10.290
What does it have to do with me once I get married?

21
00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:11.610
Why use my financial resources?

22
00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:12.930
But your Wang family

23
00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.950

24
00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:16.610
What do you know

25
00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:18.640
Every one of his houses is dismantling goods.

26
00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:23.540
If you marry me, I think you just want to surrender. If he wants to marry you, you won’t marry him.

27
00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:24.960
If you want to marry, marry yourself

28
00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.790

29
00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:28.470

30
00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.110
If you drive away this time

31
00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:31.110
I hit your leg

32
00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:41.000
But what? What kind of claws should I wrap?

33
00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:42.740
What are you talking about?

34
00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.030
If I want to cook, I can do it directly

35
00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.400
Go, go by yourself

36
00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.320
How can I have time to accompany you to the hospital?

37
00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.580

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:53.480
