00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.660
Why didn’t I know that the remaining family still had a son like you?

2
00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:05.860
Who said he was emotional?

3
00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.990
Jiang Yuyu? His surname is Jiang?

4
00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:14.900
What about me? Home? That home?

5
00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:18.880
What? Didn’t I tell you about the marriage?

6
00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:31.510
But not back? Me the year your dad passed away?

7
00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:34.270
Are you the Caihu who is greedy for leaving the family?

8
00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.440
Is that why you have such a son left?

9
00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:38.860
You just want to be the eldest wife of the family, right?

10
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.650
Ha ha ha ha. tell you,

11
00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:46.230
But since we have made reservations today,

12
00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:47.090
Just nothing.

13
00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:52.760
I have already been defeated by Xu Xia as a nanny

14
00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:55.400
There's no value in using it at all, mom

15
00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:01.260
What's the point of talking nonsense like this about losing one's family? Brother Tang

16
00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.400
What did I call you Tang Ge?

17
00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:05.300
Do you still have to thank me?

18
00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.970
The prosperous guitar in the future will be Moreau

19
00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.620
I'm giving you a security guard's butt

20
00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:15.270
How about God give you five dollars?

21
00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.930
I know enough about you, sister-in-law

22
00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:24.850
Why don't you change your home and let me go?

23
00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.220
It's the same as back then
