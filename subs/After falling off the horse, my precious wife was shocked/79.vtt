00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:02.260
Don't you want to talk to me like that?

2
00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:06.520
Same for you. Is it a good explanation?

3
00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:11.390
you say. I really don't want to play with you.

4
00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:15.180
I've wanted to tell you for a long time. But I'm afraid you'll blame me if you find out.

5
00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:18.230
So I never changed my name.

6
00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:21.710
When are you going to say it?

7
00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.540
Did you tell me when you broke up? How is that possible?

8
00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:28.110
I will never be separated from you in this life.

9
00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:31.240
Actually, I wanted to talk to you last night.

10
00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:34.460
But you have already discovered it before I said it.

11
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.620
I didn't expect you to react so strongly.

12
00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:44.060
Same for you. Are you finished?

13
00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:47.810
Having said that, I left. Like you,

14
00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.100
Trust me as soon as I leave.

15
00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:53.880
How do you want me to believe you?

16
00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:55.680
You first defrauded me of my money

17
00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:57.800
Now you're lying to me about this again

18
00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.160
How do you want me to believe you?

19
00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:05.220
Maybe you are really not suitable as a pilot?

20
00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:19.560
That's you again

21
00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:28.950
If Chen Liyuan hadnâ€™t complained

22
00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:31.330
I almost got cheated by you.

23
00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:35.700
Here Sheng Shili

24
00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.280
Why are you so obsessed with me?

25
00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.240
It is related to two major companies, mk and shangda group.

26
00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:41.360
You can't even tell the difference

27
00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:42.570
How to get to cio

28
00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.500
This is because it is cio

29
00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:45.890
It must be fair and just

30
00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:49.170
Don't blame any partiality

31
00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.380
You look at something uglier than trash

32
00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:57.790
Can you find the second one in this world? Who is it?

33
00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:59.900
we need an explanation

34
00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.740
Why is this USB flash drive here with you?
