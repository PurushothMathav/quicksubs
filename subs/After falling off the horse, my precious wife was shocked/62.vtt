00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:02.430
This is mine at auction.

2
00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:09.150
It was raw from the sweeper at the auction.

3
00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:11.850
It looks good, I came back specially,

4
00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:14.480
Taobao. Taobao.

5
00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:22.480
Isn’t this a gift I bought for you?

6
00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:24.520
Why did you get it back?

7
00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:26.080
Grandma, take it back quickly,

8
00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:28.180
Too expensive. Look, there's nothing missing.

9
00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:35.410
Grandma, take it back. Oh, oh, oh, oh, this child.

10
00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:38.110
This is what grandma introduced and bought cheaply.

11
00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:41.200
I originally had a set of that Fengguan Xia skin

12
00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:45.790
He scared you and I didn’t even buy it.

13
00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:47.750
Honesty is a salesman

14
00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:50.150
Grandma also has a bunch of creamy white pigs

15
00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:52.270
I was taken away by that pineapple wall

16
00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:56.110
Then if there is a better grandma in the future, I will buy it for your grandma.

17
00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:57.740
This is the spiritual area

18
00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:00.100
There is no need for you to give me such an expensive gift

19
00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:01.020
Keep it quickly

20
00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.250
You are a child

21
00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:05.019
What happened to spending grandma's money?

22
00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:06.540
Grandma is rich

23
00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.590
Even if grandma has money, she can’t spend it like this.

24
00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:12.490
You said you were a cleaner

25
00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:13.750
Where did you get so much money?

26
00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:18.640
I won’t pretend anymore

27
00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.660
Grandma is the rich second generation

28
00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:25.590
Just keep it with peace of mind. What's wrong?

29
00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:26.960
It's okay, it's okay

30
00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.680
I just heard my grandma say that the rich second generation was not surprised either.

31
00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.140
I didn’t expect grandma to be quite old

32
00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:34.160
Quite trendy

33
00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:37.910
Rich second generation son

34
00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:41.010
There are also good people among the rich second generation, like me.

35
00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.060
Positive, kind, gentle and considerate

36
00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:45.260
Accept justice

37
00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.720
Sometimes I plant flowers and raise cats

38
00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:50.520
never hurt others

39
00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.590
Do you believe

40
00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:56.320
Do you think your grandparents are particularly nice?

41
00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:58.890
Some of the people you and I have met

42
00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.170
It's really different
