Boss Wang, I think you should give us an explanation.

2
00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:45.540
Don't do anything wrong

3
00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:53.530
It’s not something that can be checked just by anyone.

4
00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:00.460
without substantive evidence

5
00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:02.780
Then let tomorrow be in your hands

6
00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:04.720
Isn’t that considered substantial evidence?

7
00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.200
Say you are innocent

8
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.720
Take us to your country to see

9
00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:17.010
When was it stored?

Boss Wang, the original owner of Tangku
