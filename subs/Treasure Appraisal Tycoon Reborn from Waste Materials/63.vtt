1
00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:02.820
Anti-production materials have always been our priority.

2
00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:05.230
The contract is very well written. This is your contract,

3
00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:08.010
It was signed with the former mine owner. I am now the owner of this mine.

4
00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:10.070
If you want to mine, let's re-sign this contract.

5
00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:12.460
Then you just want to make an appointment unilaterally.

6
00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:14.840
This contract was signed three years ago,

7
00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:18.230
For a whole year, you need to pay ten times the contract.

8
00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:20.220
Damn, this was definitely intentional.

9
00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.040
I don't care which of you is the mine owner, this contract is 50 million.

10
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.230
You only need to pay a small amount of compensation.

11
00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:27.850
Oops, this flow is bad,

12
00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:30.830
It's a miracle that our money was used for everything for the bomb.

13
00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.920
Let's discuss it. This week, you can get the original oral control materials first.

14
00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.860
Tell us the time for the materials from Xingkongkou and let us do the appraisal.

15
00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.780
I want the material from Xingkongkou

16
00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:45.860
It seems that you are also staying behind

17
00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:48.940
If you want this New York flight, then try to find someone who can cooperate.

18
00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:51.170
We don't know any of this money.

19
00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.920
Then take a look at the last clause of the contract

20
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.800
It doesn’t matter who holds the frame

21
00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.270
If that's the case, you really won't be able to find me.

22
00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:03.520
If you want to cause trouble, you have to take a look first.

23
00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:05.870
Where is the ownership of this box now?

24
00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:09.310
But the ownership hasn’t changed yet, brother

25
00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:14.570
Don't even think about taking away a piece of material.
