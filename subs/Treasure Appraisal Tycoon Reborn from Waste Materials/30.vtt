00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.560
Dada. How about it?

2
00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.250
daughter in law. I have just been discharged from the hospital.

3
00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:06.950
this. Why did you bring us here?

4
00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:08.870
I'm not talking about Xiao Xiao being discharged from the hospital.

5
00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:12.320
I want to give your wife a surprise.

6
00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.980
Is this the new home that daddy prepared for Xiaoxiao?

7
00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:18.420
yes. This is the new home that daddy prepared for Xiaoxiao.

8
00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:21.580
We just picked it now. Don't waste your money.

9
00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.170
Don't worry. I still have some liquid funds on hand.

10
00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:27.940
From now on, our family will no longer have hard times.

11
00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.110
rest assured. I succeeded in finding you.

12
00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:36.970
Of course we get some money

13
00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:42.400
You behave like a fool

14
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.530
Still living in such a big villa

15
00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:49.010
This is my strength-giving grace, right?

16
00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:50.780
so ridiculous

17
00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:52.460
We had no money at first

18
00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.140
When a family is displaced

19
00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:56.060
Why didn't you mention the gift of strength?

20
00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:57.850
Why are you so embarrassed now?

21
00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:01.940
You don't understand when you say this

22
00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:04.099
When my uncle and aunt died

23
00:01:04.099 --> 00:01:05.940
If my mother hadn't raised her

24
00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:07.580
You've long since starved to death

25
00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:11.220
You just published millions of texts two days ago

26
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.380
Our queen needs your help in weighing her.

27
00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:21.150
How much would it cost if you gave us this villa?
