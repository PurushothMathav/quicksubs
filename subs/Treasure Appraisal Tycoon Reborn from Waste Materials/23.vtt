00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.990
I'm such a picky eater. Look at the mouth,

2
00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:04.150
Watch me fight. These two pieces.

3
00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:06.700
These two dollars are free. You go out and go in.

4
00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:09.340
It's also my first time here, and I have the mentality of helping me play.

5
00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:11.340
You can't afford the big ones,

6
00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:14.120
Too expensive. How much do these two dollars cost?

7
00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:16.820
One thousand together. OK, deal.

8
00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:19.960
It won't be long before I go, so I rush to stop eating.

9
00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.100
This is my cousin. He is just a bigot.

10
00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.750
Come on, itâ€™s all your three yuan worth of straw.

11
00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.650
I'm still learning to stop eating for the time being. See a doctor if you are sick?

12
00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:33.750
Stop loving you. boss,

13
00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:37.210
You said you have a waste

14
00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:39.050
What good things can it be made into?

15
00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:45.880
Really saving money

16
00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.760
How could he, a loser, create a red bandit?

17
00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:55.290
Continue to open the entire red bandit

18
00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:05.750
If it's a whole piece of red bandit, I can burn them

19
00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.550
Are you stupid?

20
00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:12.370
She is a waste

21
00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:14.410
There are also fat, crispy and red ones.

22
00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:16.090
It's just a ghost

23
00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:18.290
Why is it waiting for food?

24
00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:19.970
Why are you still static?

25
00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:25.520
He was so angry that he came up with good things
