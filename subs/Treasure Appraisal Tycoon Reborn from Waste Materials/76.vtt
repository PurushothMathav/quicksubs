00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:02.850
The price is too high. This will add a few rollovers.

2
00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:05.480
It bought so much money. It seems,

3
00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:08.400
It can't survive today, it relies on this strength to turn over.

4
00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:11.880
I wonder if anyone has a higher price than me.

5
00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:15.000
One by one. Not slow.

6
00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:17.940
Can't stay. If you really want it,

7
00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:20.020
Fixed price. One hundred and fifty million.

8
00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.590
You charge. Don't offend the ban.

9
00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.810
One hundred and fifty million. How dare you drive it.

10
00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:28.570
Is 150 million expensive to you?

11
00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:31.330
Belly is solid. Belly is solid. The belly is a magic weapon.

12
00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:33.710
Such a big stone, if you win.

13
00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:35.720
Okay, one or two million.

14
00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.150
My front is blocking the needle and won't give an inch.

15
00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.360
I've been having a lot of luck lately

16
00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.620
What if I open the book and the whole hall is filled with misery?

17
00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.240
Later it was you

18
00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:04.900
Since no one has made an offer of one to five dollars,

19
00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:09.060
Then the Lin family just beat him up now

20
00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.950
This time he's going to study

21
00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:14.470
The Tianhaikou faction started fighting again

22
00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:19.130
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

23
00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:21.720
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

24
00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.860
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
