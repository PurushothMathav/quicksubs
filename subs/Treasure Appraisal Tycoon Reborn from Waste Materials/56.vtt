00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:08.940
Liu Shang, what happened to Shui Mengyu?

2
00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.830
This is just an equity occasion. Li Fei and the others can't stop us from doing official business now.

3
00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.900
I've had people play wind songs. For sale is an original frame that is almost abandoned.

4
00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:21.560
You want to sell in a box. The funds in their hands.

5
00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:25.560
I don't want their money. I want Li Fei dead.

6
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.980
No wonder, I asked him why he suddenly wanted to buy a frame.

7
00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:31.200
It turns out you arranged it early in the morning.

8
00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.740
It seems that this time you are determined to kill Li Fei.

9
00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:37.780
That's right, only Li Fei died,

10
00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.500
Only then can I feel at ease. Last time, he was allowed to escape through false pretense.

11
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.120
No, I'll let him die this time

12
00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.660
Our brother

13
00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.010
We don't have any countermeasures now

14
00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:51.450
If we keep eating like this, we will go bankrupt.

15
00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:53.860
Tianmei currently has a lot of inventory

16
00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:03.040
Enough to run our company for one year

17
00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:11.310
Join me tomorrow for another trip.

18
00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:14.130
The matter of the original frame was settled.

19
00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:16.570
You want to buy the original frame

20
00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:19.830
Which one needs a hundred and eleven funds?

21
00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.160
Now we don't have all the liquidity

22
00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.790
I simply can't afford the original
