00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.950
Boss, is this a real explanation?

2
00:00:02.009 --> 00:00:06.430
That's right. The most promising stone was also chipped away.

3
00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:09.690
Brother, let me see this piece of material.

4
00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:11.790
The stone has been chipped away.

5
00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:14.390
What's wrong with you? You have the ability to turn your time into gold.

6
00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.379
Not really. Now that it has been cut apart,

7
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.850
Then it's okay for me to show it to you. Where did the small one come from?

8
00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.470
Do you know about primitives? Do you know what materials are easy to be stolen?

9
00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:27.270
Such a waste of thought. It's not like he's deliberately getting close to Mr. Zheng.

10
00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:30.780
push. That breaks the rules.

11
00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.240
It would be great if you come here to play instead. Look at it.

12
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.010
tell me so

13
00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:51.230
Come back today and take care of your things

14
00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.560
Look through your blockage

15
00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:02.390
The young master of King Tangtang

16
00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:04.450
Wouldnâ€™t I dare to use it as a member of the board of directors?

17
00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:10.180
I can get a copy today
