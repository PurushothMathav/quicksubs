This young man's physical strength is a good sister-in-law

2
00:00:13.733 --> 00:00:15.300
It's not what you think.

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:25.866
That guy is awesome

6
00:00:25.866 --> 00:00:27.266
I can't beat him at all

7
00:00:27.266 --> 00:00:29.700
He, he, he asked me to bring you flowers

8
00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:31.300
What did he say?

9
00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.166
This time the young master is in a good mood

12
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.166
He let you know why the flowers are so red

13
00:00:40.166 --> 00:00:42.266
How dare you talk to me like that?

14
00:00:42.266 --> 00:00:43.900
Give me the fastest speed

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.366
Take the time to inspect my small mountain village

21
00:00:55.366 --> 00:00:57.433
I came here mainly to find someone

22
00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:59.966
I didn't expect to see this

23
00:00:59.966 --> 00:01:02.066
Your geographical environment is so good.

24
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.400
And the scenery is so beautiful

25
00:01:05.733 --> 00:01:07.500
Is it very suitable for a resort?

26
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.500
Yes, yes, I said that to you.

27
00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:10.866
I really remember a piece of land

28
00:01:11.266 --> 00:01:13.266
Especially suitable for meeting the resort

29
00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:14.166
How about this?
