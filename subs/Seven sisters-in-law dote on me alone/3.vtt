00:00:00.533 --> 00:00:03.133
Sisters, I told you earlier, I'm not

2
00:00:03.133 --> 00:00:04.966
I'm also very confused.

3
00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:07.066
He gave me a fight as soon as he came up

4
00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.066
That's called a misunderstanding

5
00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:12.433
You untie it for us untie it

6
00:00:17.466 --> 00:00:20.866
Oops hahaha

7
00:00:20.866 --> 00:00:21.733
Let me explain

8
00:00:21.733 --> 00:00:23.900
Let it go, let it go first

9
00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.300
Shut up, not sisters.

10
00:00:26.366 --> 00:00:27.966
Let me go first

11
00:00:27.966 --> 00:00:29.500
Let me explain, okay?

12
00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.400
As the saying goes, smells alike

13
00:00:31.533 --> 00:00:32.866
You and he are brothers

14
00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:34.466
Then you finally got there

15
00:00:34.466 --> 00:00:36.500
Now that he's dead, I'll find some accounting for you

16
00:00:36.766 --> 00:00:38.700
The little sister held him down for me

17
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.066
Don't let him do that again

18
00:00:40.066 --> 00:00:42.166
Okay, let me go first

19
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.333
Let's talk before me, okay?

20
00:00:44.333 --> 00:00:46.766
He's out there dating all six of us at the same time

21
00:00:46.933 --> 00:00:48.400
Reading where the two of us know each other

22
00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:49.733
Found the trick

23
00:00:49.733 --> 00:00:51.333
I still don't know.

24
00:00:51.333 --> 00:00:53.266
It's too early to die

25
00:00:53.266 --> 00:00:55.900
Yeah, don't think you can escape if you die

26
00:00:56.533 --> 00:00:59.033
Isn't he the president of some public company?

27
00:00:59.066 --> 00:01:01.400
Well, you give us half of his inheritance

28
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.266
It's like a mental damage fee for the sisters

29
00:01:04.566 --> 00:01:06.366
He dares to pedal on seven boats

30
00:01:06.466 --> 00:01:09.666
Aquaman is also like the president of Innocent Boys compared to him

31
00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.000
My brother is not a CEO

32
00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.000
He is just an ordinary farmer

33
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
He just left this broken house

34
00:01:17.266 --> 00:01:18.500
And a lot of debt

35
00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:20.000
Would you like some?
