1
00:00:00.666 --> 00:00:02.066
A broken invitation

2
00:00:02.266 --> 00:00:03.533
No one has yet.

3
00:00:03.533 --> 00:00:04.500
Do you think

4
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.500
Everybody's going to get this invitation at random.

5
00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:07.300
letter

6
00:00:07.466 --> 00:00:09.633
Anyone who receives this invitation

7
00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:10.566
Not the boss

8
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:11.966
The business community is huge

9
00:00:11.966 --> 00:00:14.200
You don't have a nichanga

10
00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:15.666
Let's take a gamble.

11
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.100
What to bet on

12
00:00:18.366 --> 00:00:20.000
If I get an invitation

13
00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.300
step back and apologize

14
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:23.966
If I can't get it

15
00:00:24.166 --> 00:00:25.700
I'm at your disposal

16
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:26.633
It's a deal.

17
00:00:27.166 --> 00:00:28.033
But

18
00:00:28.366 --> 00:00:32.366
If you lose, you'll have to be our watchdog

19
00:00:32.666 --> 00:00:34.200
Don't think others see too much

20
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:35.966
Don't worry, it's alright.

21
00:00:37.966 --> 00:00:38.900
Good idea.

22
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.000
Then we have a deal.

23
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.100
It's a deal.

24
00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.233
I'll only give you 10 coins.

25
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.000
Hello

26
00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.133
Boss, I'm in town now.

27
00:00:49.133 --> 00:00:50.000
You work

28
00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.500
Please send someone to send the invitation card.

29
00:00:53.933 --> 00:00:55.333
Pretending to look like

30
00:00:55.333 --> 00:00:56.800
You even sent him

31
00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:58.566
I'll tell you now.

32
00:00:59.133 --> 00:01:01.633
5 minutes left
