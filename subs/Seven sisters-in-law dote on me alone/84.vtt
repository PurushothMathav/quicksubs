00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.166
How much did he say?

2
00:00:01.333 --> 00:00:03.633
2 billion this kid is crazy

3
00:00:03.666 --> 00:00:05.466
Take 2 billion one million top coppers

4
00:00:05.466 --> 00:00:06.266
media

5
00:00:06.266 --> 00:00:08.900
With this money, didn't you play all over the motherland?

6
00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:09.700
Mr. Ye

7
00:00:10.466 --> 00:00:15.200
Are you sure it's 2 billion one million

8
00:00:15.266 --> 00:00:16.233
OK

9
00:00:16.966 --> 00:00:19.166
No way. He's lying.

10
00:00:19.366 --> 00:00:23.033
2 billion I don't have that much money

11
00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.200
What's more, you're an upstart

12
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:26.966
Where did you get so much money?

13
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.466
He's messing up

14
00:00:28.466 --> 00:00:29.666
I request capital verification

15
00:00:29.966 --> 00:00:32.500
Mr. Ye, I will request according to this side.

16
00:00:32.533 --> 00:00:34.166
Would you like to enter the capital verification?

17
00:00:34.366 --> 00:00:35.900
My money will be here soon.

18
00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:37.466
It's already on its way.

19
00:00:37.466 --> 00:00:38.400
Did you see it?

20
00:00:38.533 --> 00:00:40.000
He's stalling

21
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.366
He doesn't have that much money at all

22
00:00:42.733 --> 00:00:44.866
I advise you to kick him out quickly

23
00:00:44.966 --> 00:00:46.866
If you are not realistic and have face

24
00:00:46.866 --> 00:00:48.166
Then it's hard for me to do it too.

25
00:00:48.333 --> 00:00:49.400
President Zhang

26
00:00:49.533 --> 00:00:52.466
I said if I have money, I must have money

27
00:00:52.733 --> 00:00:54.533
I've asked you to send my people over.

28
00:00:54.533 --> 00:00:57.400
Give me another 10 minutes to stay, right?

29
00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:58.733
Let me help you.

30
00:00:58.733 --> 00:01:00.900
Come over

31
00:01:05.666 --> 00:01:06.933
I told you so.

32
00:01:06.933 --> 00:01:08.800
My money will be here soon.
