00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:01.966
I am a partner of the Grain Group

2
00:00:01.966 --> 00:00:03.066
Why are you here with me?

3
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:04.466
What do you mean?

4
00:00:04.466 --> 00:00:05.633
partner

5
00:00:05.666 --> 00:00:07.266
Why does Grain Group want to cooperate with you?

6
00:00:07.266 --> 00:00:08.866
You dug up antiques in the mine

7
00:00:09.066 --> 00:00:11.366
And my He family has mastered important resources for identification

8
00:00:12.466 --> 00:00:14.266
That the industry has the voice over

9
00:00:14.533 --> 00:00:16.966
Mr. Liang naturally asked me to come and help identify it

10
00:00:16.966 --> 00:00:18.766
priceless appraisal

11
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.400
I'm afraid it's not that simple

12
00:00:21.966 --> 00:00:23.100
Say what you want.

13
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.400
Mr. Ye is not good. Something happened in the mine.

14
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.300
What's wrong?

15
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.333
The workers started fighting

16
00:00:28.333 --> 00:00:29.166
Casualties

17
00:00:29.166 --> 00:00:30.266
And those antiques

18
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.866
What else was stolen by a few workers?

19
00:00:35.166 --> 00:00:36.033
Boss Yuan

20
00:00:36.866 --> 00:00:37.866
How is the world?

21
00:00:37.866 --> 00:00:40.066
Two workers died

22
00:00:40.066 --> 00:00:42.033
The antique thief escaped without a trace

23
00:00:42.566 --> 00:00:43.766
And this is the reality.

24
00:00:43.866 --> 00:00:46.000
They were very familiar with the surveillance blind spot.

25
00:00:46.366 --> 00:00:48.400
You can't find anything if you don't get far

26
00:00:48.466 --> 00:00:49.866
This batch of antiques was stolen

27
00:00:50.766 --> 00:00:52.000
Absolutely no police

28
00:00:52.966 --> 00:00:56.166
What Mr. Liang dug up in this mine is a cultural relic

29
00:00:56.166 --> 00:00:57.533
It's stolen now.

30
00:00:57.533 --> 00:00:58.900
Stronger than grain
