00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.400
What farmer?

2
00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:04.000
Paige, bad luck.

3
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.433
He deserved it.

4
00:00:05.566 --> 00:00:07.333
Scum is really cheap for you

5
00:00:07.333 --> 00:00:08.700
It's time I left.

6
00:00:09.066 --> 00:00:12.166
Sisters, can you get up first?

7
00:00:15.466 --> 00:00:16.466
You two

8
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:17.700
Why don't you leave?

9
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:19.400
Of course we can't go

10
00:00:19.466 --> 00:00:22.966
Ye Xin borrowed us before he died. How much 500,000

11
00:00:23.266 --> 00:00:26.466
Since you're his brother, I'll pay him back 500,000

12
00:00:27.866 --> 00:00:30.166
Dear brother, you owe so much money.

13
00:00:30.166 --> 00:00:31.666
I won't go down the mountain if anything happens

14
00:00:31.733 --> 00:00:34.200
I've already written it in black and white

15
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.100
Don't try to deny it

16
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.766
Yes, if you don't pay back the money

17
00:00:41.766 --> 00:00:44.200
We're not leaving

18
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.700
Thank you. It's none of your business.

19
00:00:47.366 --> 00:00:48.233
two

20
00:00:48.533 --> 00:00:51.100
I will pay for the money Yexin owes you.

21
00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:52.100
Are you stupid?

22
00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.500
He lied about your feelings, and you have to pay his debt

23
00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:55.666
How about this?

24
00:00:55.666 --> 00:00:57.600
He is the man who wants to be my husband

25
00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.666
And according to the customs of the village

26
00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.100
Marry the chicken and follow the chicken

27
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.266
I'm starting to wake up for you

28
00:01:06.366 --> 00:01:07.166
Okay

29
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.200
Thanks.

30
00:01:09.733 --> 00:01:11.133
Yeah! Anybody?

31
00:01:11.133 --> 00:01:12.766
Hey, I'm back.

32
00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:15.366
Hey, are you gasping for breath?

33
00:01:15.566 --> 00:01:17.600
People come out

34
00:01:18.066 --> 00:01:20.000
Oops, come out now

35
00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:21.033
Li Dazhuang

36
00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.800
What are you doing in our house? That Ye Xian is dead

37
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.500
According to the regulations, no one is conducting this space

38
00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:29.866
The village wants to recycle me

39
00:01:30.333 --> 00:01:31.600
Return the house

40
00:01:31.866 --> 00:01:33.533
You have to know each other.

41
00:01:33.533 --> 00:01:34.900
Get away
