00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:02.400
Steward, what do you want?

2
00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:03.466
What do you want?

3
00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:06.000
Don't you understand? Then let me explain it to you again.

4
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.133
You have to close the door sooner or later when you sing

5
00:00:08.133 --> 00:00:09.766
Why don't I pick a way out for you now?

6
00:00:10.066 --> 00:00:12.500
How about I take over for 100,000 bucks?

7
00:00:13.266 --> 00:00:14.466
One hundred thousand dollars.

8
00:00:14.466 --> 00:00:17.833
There are more than 100,000 antiques in my house

9
00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:20.400
You want 100,000 take over my life

10
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.466
You are dreaming

11
00:00:23.066 --> 00:00:24.200
Quite a personality

12
00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:26.166
Don't think you know Zhou Legend

13
00:00:26.166 --> 00:00:27.000
I'm all gone

14
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.966
Zhou Legend is also here as a style

15
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:30.900
He can save a fart

16
00:00:30.966 --> 00:00:33.733
Besides, waiting for you, your singing is out of business

17
00:00:33.733 --> 00:00:36.500
Maybe I can take you with me

18
00:00:37.266 --> 00:00:39.800
Blind no no no

19
00:00:40.466 --> 00:00:41.600
I don't like the next link.

20
00:00:41.733 --> 00:00:43.200
I prefer to register

21
00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:45.866
You can't get the invitation to the antique club

22
00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:47.433
As it should be

23
00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.666
The law of the jungle

24
00:00:49.933 --> 00:00:50.966
Since ancient times

25
00:00:52.566 --> 00:00:55.400
Well said hahaha

26
00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:56.866
law of the jungle

27
00:00:56.866 --> 00:01:00.333
This weak meat is talking about your ancient home, right?

28
00:01:00.333 --> 00:01:01.766
It's you again

29
00:01:01.766 --> 00:01:05.733
Just today at this moment, kneel down and beg me

30
00:01:05.733 --> 00:01:08.133
Let's write off the past

31
00:01:08.133 --> 00:01:10.600
Otherwise, after the conference

32
00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.400
I'll let you live on the streets with the Friendship Merchant

33
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.300
I will return this sentence to you.

34
00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:19.600
You really don't have enough invitations like this
