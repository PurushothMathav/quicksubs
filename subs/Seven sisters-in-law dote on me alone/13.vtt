00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:02.100
Boy trying to bluff me

2
00:00:02.166 --> 00:00:04.366
Okay, take out the evidence

3
00:00:04.366 --> 00:00:06.400
Thank you. What evidence is there?

4
00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:07.566
Don't mess around

5
00:00:07.566 --> 00:00:08.800
What did you buy yourself?

6
00:00:09.733 --> 00:00:10.600
Boss Zhou

7
00:00:11.333 --> 00:00:13.500
Borrow your prize job Xiang Yu

8
00:00:16.533 --> 00:00:17.333
OK

9
00:00:17.933 --> 00:00:19.366
What do you want?

10
00:00:23.366 --> 00:00:24.666
Ye Xian, what are you doing?

11
00:00:24.666 --> 00:00:27.600
Boy, you are breaking the jar

12
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.300
You know it's fake.

13
00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:30.600
You smashed this

14
00:00:30.933 --> 00:00:32.833
Boss Zhang, did you see it?

15
00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:33.866
Also said I did

16
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:35.833
It's nonsense.

17
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:39.833
Yes.

18
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.333
What kind of evidence can you make by making fragments?

19
00:00:43.333 --> 00:00:45.600
And this is no ordinary fragment.

20
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:46.733
As far as I know

21
00:00:46.733 --> 00:00:50.100
Antique forgers have a habit

22
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.500
I like to put my name

23
00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:55.900
Or symbolic symbols carved into this inner wall

24
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.800
Look.

25
00:00:57.266 --> 00:01:00.066
There's a chapter on it.

26
00:01:00.466 --> 00:01:01.166
Sister Shang

27
00:01:01.166 --> 00:01:04.533
Do you know a master antique forger?

28
00:01:04.533 --> 00:01:07.200
I know the house surnamed Zhang.

29
00:01:07.266 --> 00:01:08.300
It's Zhang Haozi

30
00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:09.866
He is a textile expert

31
00:01:09.866 --> 00:01:10.966
That's right.

32
00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.166
Find this Zhang Haozi and confront him face to face

33
00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:20.300
Ask the truth about who bought this fake Buddha statue
