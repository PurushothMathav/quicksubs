00:00:00.666 --> 00:00:01.900
Look, man

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.466
We are all from the same village

3
00:00:03.966 --> 00:00:05.500
Look down and don't see

4
00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:07.266
You can't do things too well.

5
00:00:07.266 --> 00:00:09.133
Can you give me a way to live?

6
00:00:09.133 --> 00:00:10.066
live

7
00:00:11.166 --> 00:00:13.200
When you bullied my sister-in-law

8
00:00:13.333 --> 00:00:15.000
When insulting my Ye family

9
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.400
Have you ever thought of giving my Ye family a way to live?

10
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:20.966
Oh, dear.

11
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.900
I was wrong. I'm not human.

12
00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:25.900
I destroyed your house

13
00:00:26.166 --> 00:00:28.866
But I was also forced to be helpless

14
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:31.833
Who is getting married?

15
00:00:32.766 --> 00:00:33.566
This

16
00:00:34.333 --> 00:00:35.766
If I say

17
00:00:35.866 --> 00:00:38.166
Sister Hui, can you let me go?

18
00:00:38.166 --> 00:00:40.200
You've missed your chance to explain

19
00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:41.400
You don't say

20
00:00:41.966 --> 00:00:43.833
And I'm just going to hand them over.

21
00:00:44.466 --> 00:00:46.500
Ok ok ok I said I'll do it

22
00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:47.666
It's He Xiaoze

23
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.200
He Xiaoze forced me to kill you

24
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.100
I was also forced to do so, He Xiaoze

25
00:00:55.333 --> 00:00:56.633
Sure enough it was him

26
00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:57.600
elder sister

27
00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.100
I said it all, can you let me go?

28
00:01:00.733 --> 00:01:01.533
let go

29
00:01:02.966 --> 00:01:05.200
Are you going to call someone else?

30
00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:06.666
If not for you

31
00:01:06.666 --> 00:01:07.833
In our landscape

32
00:01:08.166 --> 00:01:09.733
Will it become a poverty-stricken village?

33
00:01:09.733 --> 00:01:11.233
Corrupt officials like you

34
00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.100
Must be eradicated

35
00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.766
You lied to me. You lied to me.

36
00:01:18.166 --> 00:01:20.000
I didn't promise you anything.

37
00:01:21.466 --> 00:01:22.266
Boss Zhou

38
00:01:23.166 --> 00:01:24.266
It's over to you.
