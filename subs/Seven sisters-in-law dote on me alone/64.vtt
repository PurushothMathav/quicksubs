00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:03.100
Boy, I thought you were so capable

2
00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:05.066
In the end, didn't you take an inspection?

3
00:00:05.133 --> 00:00:06.833
Where was your strength just now?

4
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:08.566
Hurry up and take it out

5
00:00:08.766 --> 00:00:10.166
Eyeless

6
00:00:10.166 --> 00:00:11.133
Pardon me?

7
00:00:11.133 --> 00:00:13.833
I said the conference has no eyeballs

8
00:00:15.933 --> 00:00:16.866
proverb

9
00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:18.300
handed down

10
00:00:18.866 --> 00:00:21.300
Shebel and others think it is acquaintance

11
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:22.966
So blind

12
00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:24.100
What's that?

13
00:00:24.533 --> 00:00:25.333
What!

14
00:00:25.866 --> 00:00:27.400
handed down

15
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:28.666
true or false?

16
00:00:28.666 --> 00:00:30.866
Sir, what do you mean?

17
00:00:30.866 --> 00:00:33.400
Mr. Ye, please sit down

18
00:00:33.666 --> 00:00:36.900
You can't go wrong with what has been identified at the antique conference.

19
00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:41.033
Mr. Liang, about this landscape painting

20
00:00:41.333 --> 00:00:44.300
And they were wrong.

21
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:45.600
So small

22
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.200
Then you mean the Antique Appraisal Conference Athens

23
00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:51.200
Then tell me where they went wrong

24
00:00:51.466 --> 00:00:52.500
OK

25
00:00:53.533 --> 00:00:54.900
This first mistake

26
00:00:55.166 --> 00:00:57.800
That is to say, the words of the landscape are hard

27
00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:59.566
And this second mistake

28
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.100
That is to say, this Longquan Poverty is genuine.

29
00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.366
The real beauty is this Longquan celadon

30
00:01:05.533 --> 00:01:07.000
Nonsense

31
00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.266
He's clearly messing up

32
00:01:09.333 --> 00:01:10.566
Hurry up and get people out

33
00:01:10.733 --> 00:01:12.700
Thank you.

34
00:01:12.733 --> 00:01:15.200
If I say I have a way
