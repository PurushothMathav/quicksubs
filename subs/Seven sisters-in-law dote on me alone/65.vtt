1
00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.600
Presumptuous who are you?

2
00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:04.200
What qualifications do you have?

3
00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:05.600
You nobody

4
00:00:06.266 --> 00:00:09.900
Really, please trouble Boss Liang.

5
00:00:09.933 --> 00:00:12.566
Be my witness and introducer

6
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:17.933
If I can't prove the claim is correct

7
00:00:17.933 --> 00:00:18.833
No one cares

8
00:00:19.266 --> 00:00:21.600
I will die by myself

9
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.233
This is what you said.

10
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.466
Why has Mr. Ye caused such trouble?

11
00:00:27.566 --> 00:00:30.100
Ye Xian, you are too successful

12
00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:31.600
Can't start business

13
00:00:38.533 --> 00:00:41.533
Since this request and the bet are all made by you

14
00:00:41.533 --> 00:00:43.666
Then you can show the big guy

15
00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.866
How did you prove that you were right?

16
00:00:45.866 --> 00:00:47.466
This ship is dead

17
00:00:47.566 --> 00:00:49.500
The huge one looks like four years.

18
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.000
How can it be fake?

19
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.200
Thanks.

20
00:00:54.933 --> 00:00:56.200
These four words

21
00:00:56.733 --> 00:00:57.966
Indeed

22
00:00:59.866 --> 00:01:00.766
But

23
00:01:01.366 --> 00:01:03.433
This review is a splicing thing.

24
00:01:03.533 --> 00:01:05.633
Don't eat this dish at all

25
00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.000
Splicing, how are you eating it? It's splicing porridge?

26
00:01:09.133 --> 00:01:10.433
Mind flat

27
00:01:10.966 --> 00:01:13.800
Where the bottom of the old bottle is spliced

28
00:01:14.066 --> 00:01:15.300
Superb memory

29
00:01:15.966 --> 00:01:20.700
But the problem lies in the flaw of this bottle

30
00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.700
Ye Xian, you are so brave

31
00:01:28.066 --> 00:01:29.533
How dare you take our monk's rim

32
00:01:29.533 --> 00:01:31.066
Qingsi was smashed

33
00:01:31.566 --> 00:01:34.233
Ye Xian is courting death
