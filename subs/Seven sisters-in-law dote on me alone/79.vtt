00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:02.966
Even if the company enters bankruptcy auction liquidation

2
00:00:03.266 --> 00:00:05.500
That's worth hundreds of millions

3
00:00:05.666 --> 00:00:07.366
How do we go to the auction?

4
00:00:07.366 --> 00:00:08.466
And business insurance

5
00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:10.666
Do you have that much money?

6
00:00:10.666 --> 00:00:12.866
I don't have it. What do you want to buy?

7
00:00:13.666 --> 00:00:14.966
I know someone

8
00:00:15.966 --> 00:00:16.800
Hello

9
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:18.566
old man

10
00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:20.166
Borrow some money

11
00:00:20.466 --> 00:00:23.100
Borrowing money without a sister

12
00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:24.866
Do I look like money to you?

13
00:00:24.866 --> 00:00:27.366
Okay, no borrowing, right?

14
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.900
Then I'll retail your zero birds and zero eggs.

15
00:00:31.133 --> 00:00:32.133
Take it all and sell it

16
00:00:32.133 --> 00:00:33.466
And that broken house

17
00:00:33.566 --> 00:00:34.866
I also took it apart and sold it.

18
00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:36.166
Ok ok ok ok

19
00:00:36.166 --> 00:00:37.466
Say you are cruel

20
00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.400
But on the way to Weiss' Gate

21
00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:40.966
There is a Chinese guardian

22
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.333
I spent my life knitting with him

23
00:00:42.333 --> 00:00:44.700
How much do you want to tell him, thank you, master?

24
00:00:44.733 --> 00:00:46.933
Master, I wish you a long life

25
00:00:46.933 --> 00:00:48.666
Love you oh

26
00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:51.466
Get it done

27
00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.333
That's it.

28
00:00:53.333 --> 00:00:55.500
Stop playing, let's go

29
00:00:56.566 --> 00:00:57.366
president

30
00:00:58.666 --> 00:00:59.933
Why are you here?

31
00:00:59.933 --> 00:01:02.766
President, I can help you first

32
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:03.833
Help me.

33
00:01:04.366 --> 00:01:06.766
How did you get it back for me?

34
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.800
I know you don't want Summit Media to be left behind

35
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.433
I think we should be poor

36
00:01:12.766 --> 00:01:14.066
We come this time

37
00:01:14.366 --> 00:01:15.966
It's to help you acquire Summit Media
