00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.033
701 million 800 million

2
00:00:04.166 --> 00:00:05.766
Do you have more guts?

3
00:00:05.766 --> 00:00:07.800
Don't 1 million 1 million

4
00:00:07.866 --> 00:00:09.900
800 million zero

5
00:00:10.333 --> 00:00:11.500
Two million.

6
00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:15.133
OK, thanks. You like it, don't you?

7
00:00:15.133 --> 00:00:18.266
The major general, look at the upper level

8
00:00:18.266 --> 00:00:19.966
It's so different from your soil

9
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.200
I give 10 years

10
00:00:22.266 --> 00:00:25.500
Your authority at the top is only about 700 million

11
00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:27.666
The monk married 1 billion

12
00:00:27.933 --> 00:00:30.066
That's not deep pockets at all.

13
00:00:30.066 --> 00:00:32.700
Is this just for emotional burning money?

14
00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.966
So it looks like the winner is certain.

15
00:00:34.966 --> 00:00:35.966
What's wrong Ye Xian

16
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.633
No more points.

17
00:00:38.366 --> 00:00:39.466
Okay, Ye Xian

18
00:00:39.566 --> 00:00:42.000
This is completely beyond the reasonable market price

19
00:00:42.333 --> 00:00:44.066
Let's not add any more.

20
00:00:44.066 --> 00:00:46.766
Ye Xian, aren't you very good?

21
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.966
Isn't 1 million 1 million home every time?

22
00:00:49.966 --> 00:00:52.266
Hey, why don't you speak?

23
00:00:52.266 --> 00:00:53.666
Out of money, right?

24
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.933
Hey, do you want me to lend you some?

25
00:00:56.933 --> 00:00:58.433
Add some more

26
00:00:58.533 --> 00:01:00.633
I really want you to call again.

27
00:01:03.333 --> 00:01:05.366
1 billion time

28
00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:07.300
See if it's off the shelves.

29
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.033
1 billion twice

30
00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:11.000
My generation

31
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.233
I have never heard such an unreasonable request

32
00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:14.966
Now that you brought it up

33
00:01:14.966 --> 00:01:16.200
I satisfy you

34
00:01:16.566 --> 00:01:18.633
Didn't you say I had one leg?

35
00:01:18.766 --> 00:01:21.000
Then I'll let you see if your legs are

36
00:01:22.166 --> 00:01:23.200
I go out

37
00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.966
2 billion you

38
00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:28.500
1 million
