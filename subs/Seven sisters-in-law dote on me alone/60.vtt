1
00:00:00.466 --> 00:00:01.366
Security captain

2
00:00:02.133 --> 00:00:04.900
You are fired from now on

3
00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:06.500
Before you leave

4
00:00:06.766 --> 00:00:08.033
Do one last thing

5
00:00:08.566 --> 00:00:09.800
Put a few of them

6
00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:12.466
Drag me out and give me a good beating

7
00:00:12.466 --> 00:00:14.066
No, we're slow.

8
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.000
Manager Zhou has dinner

9
00:00:16.066 --> 00:00:19.200
Who told you we didn't have an invitation?

10
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.200
Our monk said you didn't

11
00:00:21.566 --> 00:00:23.066
You just don't have it.

12
00:00:23.733 --> 00:00:26.500
Ye Xian, what about your arrogance just now?

13
00:00:26.533 --> 00:00:29.366
Why don't you see how you die?

14
00:00:29.933 --> 00:00:33.000
Ye Xian, this is the end of going against me

15
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.766
Hurry up and do it!

16
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.166
Do it with me

17
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:37.800
You also deserve

18
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:38.833
Wait a minute

19
00:00:39.666 --> 00:00:40.700
Thanks what's the matter

20
00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:44.700
They said I was a fool without an invitation

21
00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:47.966
Uh, how many?

22
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.300
I know Mr. Ip

23
00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:51.900
I take a personal guarantee

24
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.400
He will never touch you

25
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:54.200
Come on.

26
00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.033
This person should be Ye Xian's backer

27
00:00:57.533 --> 00:01:00.000
Zhou Legend, a boss in our small county seat

28
00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.500
You guarantee who you are

29
00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:05.766
You are just a small county seat

30
00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:08.766
To catch up with things that surpass me

31
00:01:09.133 --> 00:01:09.933
monk

32
00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.300
There's been a misunderstanding.

33
00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:13.866
So your people are not party

34
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.400
I will pay for medical expenses and nutrition expenses

35
00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:17.866
I'm the eater

36
00:01:18.133 --> 00:01:20.366
Apologize to you and them.

37
00:01:21.533 --> 00:01:22.300
Are you okay?

38
00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:23.300
Good idea.

39
00:01:24.066 --> 00:01:25.766
You're going to help them, right?

40
00:01:25.766 --> 00:01:28.766
Then die with them

41
00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:30.066
Come on

42
00:01:30.066 --> 00:01:31.433
They go together
