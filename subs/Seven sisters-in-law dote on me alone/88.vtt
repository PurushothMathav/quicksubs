00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:10.966
Hello Jin Qiang

2
00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:13.900
What's wrong, Ye Xian is not good?

3
00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:14.900
Joined us at the bottom of the palace

4
00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:16.866
All five platforms just sent money to make an appointment.

5
00:00:16.866 --> 00:00:18.566
Otherwise, I always dream of living together

6
00:00:18.866 --> 00:00:19.800
termination

7
00:00:20.533 --> 00:00:22.133
Why, as far as I know

8
00:00:22.133 --> 00:00:23.800
They were all in danger from He Xiaoze

9
00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:24.800
I will not terminate our contract

10
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.500
What kind of comprehensive blow will it take?

11
00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.233
He Xiaoze

12
00:00:29.133 --> 00:00:30.466
It's He Xiaoze again

13
00:00:30.466 --> 00:00:31.766
Really courting death

14
00:00:31.766 --> 00:00:33.600
Okay, now what?

15
00:00:35.466 --> 00:00:36.433
No platform

16
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.400
Then let's build a platform

17
00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.866
But

18
00:00:39.866 --> 00:00:41.900
The funding required to build a platform is not a novel

19
00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.733
And the new platform has no stars.

20
00:00:43.733 --> 00:00:44.300
No traffic.

21
00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.533
If there is no larger amount of money to pull the bottom

22
00:00:46.533 --> 00:00:47.733
Can't survive

23
00:00:47.733 --> 00:00:49.700
Leave the money to me

24
00:00:49.933 --> 00:00:51.433
How about you, live stream well.

25
00:00:52.066 --> 00:00:53.600
Is Xiaoxian alright?

26
00:00:54.533 --> 00:00:55.333
Yeah.

27
00:00:56.766 --> 00:00:58.900
Since He Xiaoze wants to play

28
00:01:00.133 --> 00:01:01.833
Then Xiao Ming, I will play with him to the end

29
00:01:01.966 --> 00:01:03.000
Mr. Ye appears

30
00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:05.400
Ye

31
00:01:06.466 --> 00:01:07.266
Is there a leaf money missing?

32
00:01:07.266 --> 00:01:11.033
Hurry up and invite him in, senior brother

33
00:01:12.533 --> 00:01:14.033
Oops, Ye Shiyi

34
00:01:14.066 --> 00:01:15.400
Don't be so polite

35
00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:16.800
Come, please take a seat

36
00:01:21.466 --> 00:01:23.600
Brother Ye came to me today

37
00:01:24.166 --> 00:01:25.400
Did something happen?

38
00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:26.433
Brother Chen

39
00:01:27.133 --> 00:01:28.033
Tell the truth

40
00:01:28.733 --> 00:01:30.700
I have established a new live broadcast company here.

41
00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.766
Was targeted by He Xiaoze

42
00:01:32.966 --> 00:01:36.066
Now all live broadcast platforms have taught me for a few months.

43
00:01:36.133 --> 00:01:39.600
I'm in desperate need of some money for advertising

44
00:01:39.733 --> 00:01:40.533
This is not

45
00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:42.600
Trouble brother again

46
00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.100
Okay, got it.

47
00:01:48.366 --> 00:01:49.400
50 billion not much
