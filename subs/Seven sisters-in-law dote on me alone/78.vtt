00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:00.933
monk

2
00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:02.866
What do you mean?

3
00:00:03.466 --> 00:00:04.600
What do you mean?

4
00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.866
I've got people working on Summit Media.

5
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:09.866
I'll tell you tomorrow.

6
00:00:09.866 --> 00:00:10.866
Is easy

7
00:00:10.866 --> 00:00:12.400
If you don't sell now

8
00:00:12.566 --> 00:00:14.533
Summit Media will estimate

9
00:00:14.533 --> 00:00:16.066
Waiting for bankruptcy liquidation

10
00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.600
At that time, I will use Summit Media to stimulate

11
00:00:20.133 --> 00:00:22.200
More than 5% at the lowest price.

12
00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:26.300
So I advise you to resist carefully

13
00:00:29.133 --> 00:00:29.933
Do you still want it?

14
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.600
Summit Media is my blood

15
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.766
It's bankruptcy and dissolution

16
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.033
I won't sell you either

17
00:00:40.766 --> 00:00:43.666
Is that right? Then why don't we get married?

18
00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:52.200
Oh, I see.

19
00:00:57.066 --> 00:00:58.866
Often what's wrong

20
00:00:58.866 --> 00:01:00.500
He Xiaozi wants to take back our union

21
00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:01.466
Summit Media

22
00:01:01.933 --> 00:01:03.200
The president did not agree

23
00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.633
He used the means of being green to make a malicious takeover

24
00:01:05.866 --> 00:01:06.966
Your Majesty

25
00:01:06.966 --> 00:01:09.066
Our company is going bankrupt

26
00:01:09.166 --> 00:01:09.966
What!

27
00:01:09.966 --> 00:01:12.966
Then He Xiaoze is definitely coming for me

28
00:01:12.966 --> 00:01:14.900
If he becomes the boss of Summit Media

29
00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.400
I'm going to be tortured

30
00:01:17.733 --> 00:01:19.400
And I'm now more enthusiastic

31
00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:20.900
If I take the initiative to save

32
00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.166
Liquidated damages are sky-high

33
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.633
What should I do?

34
00:01:28.266 --> 00:01:29.100
that

35
00:01:30.066 --> 00:01:32.666
If Headwind hadn't gone bankrupt

36
00:01:35.133 --> 00:01:36.666
There will be bankruptcy liquidation

37
00:01:36.666 --> 00:01:38.900
The company's assets enter the auction process

38
00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:40.566
Auction debt

39
00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:42.666
That is to say

40
00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.700
If we buy some engineering fees at the auction

41
00:01:45.866 --> 00:01:47.400
Then you can defuse yourself
