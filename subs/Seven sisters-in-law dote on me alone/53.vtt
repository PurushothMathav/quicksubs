00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:01.633
10 minutes have passed

2
00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:03.000
What about the person who delivered the invitation today?

3
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.433
Why hasn't it been there yet?

4
00:00:04.533 --> 00:00:05.366
You see

5
00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:06.766
Come on.

6
00:00:06.766 --> 00:00:08.200
Hello, Mr. Li.

7
00:00:08.333 --> 00:00:10.166
This is the invitation to our antique convention

8
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.433
Please take it.

9
00:00:11.666 --> 00:00:14.100
Then thank Boss Liang for me.

10
00:00:14.733 --> 00:00:15.833
Looks like I won

11
00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:17.766
Absolutely impossible

12
00:00:18.333 --> 00:00:19.800
How could you be invited?

13
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.033
What about the child, the president is already fake

14
00:00:22.066 --> 00:00:24.233
I see you are really a dead duck

15
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.833
You mouth

16
00:00:25.966 --> 00:00:27.066
It's fate.

17
00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:28.600
Ah!

18
00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:30.566
Hahahaha

19
00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:32.966
Look at my invitation

20
00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.233
It's all Phnom Penh ironing

21
00:00:35.366 --> 00:00:37.300
And your invitation letter

22
00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:39.933
Just words written on a blank sheet of paper

23
00:00:39.933 --> 00:00:41.266
You are not fake

24
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.033
Which one is fake?

25
00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:46.033
It shouldn't be.

26
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.066
Boss Liang can't have a fake request.

27
00:00:49.366 --> 00:00:51.300
Hmm, stop pretending

28
00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.666
It's all pierced by me, when will it be installed?

29
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:55.566
Let's not choose a leash

30
00:00:55.566 --> 00:00:56.600
Bring it yourself
