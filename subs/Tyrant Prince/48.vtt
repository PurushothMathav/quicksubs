00:00:01.766 --> 00:00:02.800
Zhuge love

2
00:00:03.133 --> 00:00:04.266
Yesterday's daily newspaper

3
00:00:04.266 --> 00:00:05.333
Last month's monthly report

4
00:00:05.333 --> 00:00:06.833
You guys ready?

5
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.900
This is the daily newspaper you wrote

6
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.066
Get up at 3:00

7
00:00:32.066 --> 00:00:33.433
Call flowers at 4 o'clock

8
00:00:34.566 --> 00:00:35.400
Your Highness

9
00:00:35.533 --> 00:00:38.900
Why don't you add when you leave the palace?

10
00:00:39.133 --> 00:00:40.600
As a country

11
00:00:40.733 --> 00:00:42.366
What the hell

12
00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:44.433
So many people

13
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.300
What other people can do?

14
00:00:47.133 --> 00:00:49.466
Which country was built?

15
00:00:49.466 --> 00:00:51.300
What are these two written about?

16
00:00:51.866 --> 00:00:52.933
Ride backwards for 6 seconds

17
00:00:52.933 --> 00:00:54.900
Brothel gambling

18
00:00:55.266 --> 00:00:56.600
The prince's words are bad

19
00:00:57.566 --> 00:00:59.000
Ministers and others are worried about the country

20
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.666
No matter what you do on the surface

21
00:01:00.666 --> 00:01:03.600
In fact, what is told in the mouth is also a national event

22
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:04.666
Why not?

23
00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:06.700
Then what big state affairs do you talk about?

24
00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.433
Let me hear it

25
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.466
Inspector banquets the city

26
00:01:12.366 --> 00:01:14.400
Daily what daily

27
00:01:15.466 --> 00:01:16.500
I don't have it.

28
00:01:16.533 --> 00:01:17.600
Why not?

29
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.000
I don't want to write

30
00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:20.266
Why not write

31
00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:24.766
My father is the Great Xia God of War, Prince Qin Zhan

32
00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:29.066
Compared to these officials from humble backgrounds

33
00:01:29.533 --> 00:01:31.233
More loyal and reliable

34
00:01:31.566 --> 00:01:33.566
How can I learn to write this crap?

35
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.433
So I feel very loyal

36
00:01:37.733 --> 00:01:39.200
Of course.

37
00:01:39.866 --> 00:01:41.233
When it comes to loyalty

38
00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.633
No one is better than me

39
00:01:44.966 --> 00:01:46.500
I'll give it a try.
