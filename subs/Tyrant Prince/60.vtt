1
00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.066
King Yong's words are true

2
00:00:02.066 --> 00:00:04.366
That's what 5 million

3
00:00:05.166 --> 00:00:07.500
Yeah, well done.

4
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:08.300
Father Emperor

5
00:00:08.666 --> 00:00:10.966
This is King Yong's face to pick it up by family

6
00:00:10.966 --> 00:00:13.733
Rich folk merchants borrowed King Yong's sincere conscience

7
00:00:13.733 --> 00:00:16.133
The hero can be said to be intentional

8
00:00:16.133 --> 00:00:18.900
King Yong is indeed loyal

9
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.466
For His Majesty's Siege Hospital

10
00:00:21.466 --> 00:00:22.600
Don't mention this old face

11
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.433
Even if you kill me, I won't hesitate

12
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.600
Father, listen to what a loyal general this is

13
00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:31.166
Even the sons and daughters are deeply in awe and courage

14
00:00:31.166 --> 00:00:33.000
Truly loyal

15
00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:34.133
But the father

16
00:00:34.133 --> 00:00:36.766
His Royal Highness not only squandered the treasury and talents

17
00:00:36.766 --> 00:00:39.400
He also separated the dangerous official position of the son of King Yong

18
00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.933
Isn't this in the cold heart of King Yong?

19
00:00:41.933 --> 00:00:43.400
Although the prince has no way

20
00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.233
But King Yong sent the silver beam for the first time

21
00:00:46.266 --> 00:00:48.466
Father Emperor, please stand tall

22
00:00:48.466 --> 00:00:50.700
The third prince means

23
00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:52.766
His Royal Highness the Crown Prince is arrogant and domineering

24
00:00:52.766 --> 00:00:55.166
Ignoring the international face of old ministers and veterans

25
00:00:55.166 --> 00:00:57.933
The son advises that you should avoid the Eastern Palace for a period of time

26
00:00:57.933 --> 00:00:59.966
Care about supervision

27
00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:03.466
Your Majesty has just returned to Beijing after besieging the city for two days

28
00:01:03.466 --> 00:01:05.600
I have heard 11 senior officials

29
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.366
Tearfully accusing the prince of all kinds of disgust

30
00:01:08.366 --> 00:01:11.466
Don't punish the trip of the prince and the impoverished minister?

31
00:01:11.466 --> 00:01:13.600
His Royal Highness also squandered the treasury

32
00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:14.966
This is inhumane

33
00:01:15.466 --> 00:01:16.266
Is it unfilial?

34
00:01:16.266 --> 00:01:17.166
The prince said

35
00:01:17.166 --> 00:01:20.933
He can get 30 million banknotes in one day

36
00:01:20.933 --> 00:01:24.166
King Yong, please take back these silver bills first

37
00:01:24.166 --> 00:01:26.833
When the news of the prince arrives

38
00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.800
30 million, the two princes are afraid they are not crazy

39
00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.500
You can even spend money on this kind of Haikou

40
00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.766
Father Emperor now has the most private wealthy businesspeople

41
00:01:34.766 --> 00:01:36.300
It's only 10,000 taels of silver a day

42
00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:37.500
Earn 30 million taels a day

43
00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.233
I'm afraid what His Royal Highness said is not a ghost coin, Father Emperor
