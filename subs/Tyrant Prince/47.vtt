00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:03.833
Your Highness

2
00:00:04.533 --> 00:00:07.266
What are you really writing about? The Old Lion Daily Monthly?

3
00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.700
Are you completely confused about your new job?

4
00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:12.200
That useless prince gave an order

5
00:00:12.666 --> 00:00:14.166
Oh, dear.

6
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.033
Are you kidding me?

7
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:18.966
I don't even write memorials

8
00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:22.700
The paperwork of the Inspectorate was piled up with three people

9
00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:24.500
Let me set it on fire

10
00:00:25.133 --> 00:00:27.300
Let me write a tattered daily monthly report

11
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.600
Smile or write carefully

12
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.400
Don't forget the brush of diligent repair

13
00:00:32.766 --> 00:00:34.800
Look at these things recently

14
00:00:34.866 --> 00:00:36.600
This kid is very hot

15
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.500
Totally unexpected

16
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.200
What is that

17
00:00:41.466 --> 00:00:44.900
My father, Qin Zhan, is the god of war in Zhenguo

18
00:00:45.166 --> 00:00:47.200
Prince of the Great Xia Dynasty

19
00:00:47.333 --> 00:00:49.266
Be today's cousin

20
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.400
Your Majesty doesn't care about me

21
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.633
What the hell is he?

22
00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:57.566
Don't call me with chicken feathers as arrows

23
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.233
That's true.

24
00:01:00.533 --> 00:01:03.366
The prince is under one person in Great Xia

25
00:01:03.366 --> 00:01:05.066
The army has great prestige

26
00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:06.733
Oops, that trash prince

27
00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:09.200
He only dares to bully and bully me and other cultural ministers

28
00:01:09.533 --> 00:01:11.900
Don't dare to recruit people to dislike you?

29
00:01:12.266 --> 00:01:15.200
Yan Xiang, want me to say it?

30
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.366
Stop writing

31
00:01:17.366 --> 00:01:20.000
You people are just too cowardly

32
00:01:20.166 --> 00:01:21.366
He just said

33
00:01:21.366 --> 00:01:23.100
He dare not do anything to you

34
00:01:23.133 --> 00:01:24.400
I'll tell my dad later.

35
00:01:25.133 --> 00:01:26.100
Think stupid and soft

36
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.566
Hahahahaha

37
00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.166
The prophet said very well

38
00:01:30.166 --> 00:01:31.466
Hahahaha

39
00:01:31.566 --> 00:01:34.200
Oh, then I will find someone to represent me.

40
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.200
Just write at will

41
00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.266
There is the face of Prince Qin Zhang

42
00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.433
Then Qin Xiu didn't dare to make trouble

43
00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.166
My father will cross the border in a few days

44
00:01:43.166 --> 00:01:45.233
Return to Heaven with the British Prince

45
00:01:45.266 --> 00:01:48.500
Okay, this is a good day for diligent repair

46
00:01:49.966 --> 00:01:53.233
It's been a few days, hahaha, someone is coming.

47
00:01:55.733 --> 00:01:57.833
Take down these two daily and monthly reports

48
00:01:57.866 --> 00:01:59.366
Find a Mr. Agent

49
00:01:59.366 --> 00:02:00.866
Prepare another feast

50
00:02:01.166 --> 00:02:03.633
I'm going to drink with my office
