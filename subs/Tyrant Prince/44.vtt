1
00:00:03.466 --> 00:00:05.966
I guess this will be my flying prince brother

2
00:00:05.966 --> 00:00:07.500
Has been stripped of the crown prince

3
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:08.566
Come mother

4
00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:09.933
We've been on the air for a long time

5
00:00:09.933 --> 00:00:11.000
Celebrate

6
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.300
He definitely can't write three words

7
00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:14.900
You can start preparing today.

8
00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:17.333
Learning how to be a qualified prince

9
00:00:17.333 --> 00:00:18.300
But I'm also curious

10
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.066
What can my flying brother write?

11
00:00:21.066 --> 00:00:23.100
How ridiculous to think about it

12
00:00:23.933 --> 00:00:26.100
Baby prince

13
00:00:26.366 --> 00:00:28.000
The prince wrote it out

14
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.766
How is this possible?

15
00:00:33.866 --> 00:00:37.766
His apprentice is so talented

16
00:00:37.766 --> 00:00:39.600
The prince wrote it in the blink of an eye

17
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:40.800
Mr. Fang is ashamed

18
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:41.666
remorse vomiting blood

19
00:00:41.666 --> 00:00:43.066
His Royal Highness the Crown Prince knelt down on the spot

20
00:00:43.066 --> 00:00:45.300
It turns out that His Highness has talents in this world

21
00:00:45.466 --> 00:00:47.200
It's been hidden

22
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:48.800
I don't accept it.

23
00:00:49.066 --> 00:00:52.400
However, His Royal Highness the Crown Prince said that day that he wanted to implement the imperial examinations

24
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.266
Selection of poor disciples to enter the dynasty

25
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.466
The matter has already fallen out in the Golden Palace

26
00:00:56.466 --> 00:00:58.866
Several ministers threatened to kill them on the spot.

27
00:00:58.866 --> 00:01:00.833
First Prince, this is a good opportunity

28
00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.766
Hmph he fool

29
00:01:03.766 --> 00:01:05.666
How dare you propose such a national policy?

30
00:01:05.733 --> 00:01:07.200
Selecting talents from underprivileged backgrounds

31
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.333
This allows future generations of these powerful people

32
00:01:09.333 --> 00:01:10.533
Why can't I see him?

33
00:01:10.533 --> 00:01:11.500
Humph this

34
00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.033
It directly affected the interests of all the powerful people under my command

35
00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:17.133
This diligent cultivation is to make everyone the enemy

36
00:01:17.133 --> 00:01:19.133
I used to only target him strictly

37
00:01:19.133 --> 00:01:20.400
This policy is proposed

38
00:01:20.733 --> 00:01:22.933
From powerful wives to civil and military officials

39
00:01:22.933 --> 00:01:24.066
Even places

40
00:01:24.266 --> 00:01:26.100
We must join forces to take him down

41
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:27.900
kill

42
00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:33.233
You know what these are

43
00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.700
This is the mantra that lays down Zen engravings on you all over the country

44
00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:37.866
The great prime minister

45
00:01:37.866 --> 00:01:40.033
The little ninth-grade officials are scolding you.

46
00:01:40.533 --> 00:01:42.866
How faint to talk about the imperial examination
