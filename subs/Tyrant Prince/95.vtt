00:00:07.533 --> 00:00:09.233
Say Your Highness

2
00:00:09.266 --> 00:00:12.300
The cavalry of the gold and silver army has arrived outside the city gate

3
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.100
Now facing off against 3,000 special forces

4
00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:17.666
There's just a huge difference in numbers.

5
00:00:17.666 --> 00:00:20.266
Well, that might not be good.

6
00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.466
Please laugh with a eunuch to analyze the situation

7
00:00:23.466 --> 00:00:24.800
I can see better than you

8
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.166
Why are you struggling to think?

9
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.366
It's a little early

10
00:00:28.366 --> 00:00:30.200
My special forces are Pepe's missiles

11
00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.333
You have seen the power of this missile

12
00:00:32.333 --> 00:00:33.966
What if you have missiles?

13
00:00:33.966 --> 00:00:36.500
That's 100,000 cavalry

14
00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.866
You can't beat 3,000 troops

15
00:00:39.266 --> 00:00:40.600
100,000 Iron Cavalry

16
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:41.900
Father is crazy

17
00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.100
That's a genius

18
00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:44.466
Not my kind

19
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:45.766
If at first

20
00:00:45.766 --> 00:00:48.100
I didn't follow the same path as my father

21
00:00:48.166 --> 00:00:51.600
I'm the one enjoying the care now, right?

22
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.566
Do you want to wait a little longer?

23
00:00:53.566 --> 00:00:56.566
I see you're in a hurry. What are you waiting for?

24
00:00:56.666 --> 00:00:58.633
Are you waiting for the news that you will be wiped out?

25
00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.900
Report to Your Majesty, in the face of an astonishing attack

26
00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:04.366
Special forces use firearms

27
00:01:04.366 --> 00:01:06.600
A total of more than 3,000 guns were consumed

28
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.966
A shocking death toll of nearly 10,000

29
00:01:09.166 --> 00:01:10.066
How is that possible?

30
00:01:10.066 --> 00:01:12.366
What should I do?

31
00:01:12.366 --> 00:01:14.633
It's just an appetizer

32
00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.066
Your Highness, why are you here?

33
00:01:17.066 --> 00:01:18.500
Didn't I tell you to guard the city gate tower?

34
00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:19.400
Your Highness Ghost Handle

35
00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.033
I have arranged for people to do business, and then I will come back to send the news.
