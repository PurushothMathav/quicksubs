1
00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.066
Let's do it together.

2
00:00:01.066 --> 00:00:03.700
The Crown Prince actually wants to teach Great Xia hell to be human

3
00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:04.700
religious poetry

4
00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:05.900
I'm afraid he's not crazy

5
00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:08.333
He can't even compare to a single hair of Fang Xiaotu

6
00:00:08.333 --> 00:00:09.633
The prince is cautious

7
00:00:09.733 --> 00:00:11.766
Mr. Fang is the first scholar in Great Xia

8
00:00:11.766 --> 00:00:13.500
Poetry is at its peak

9
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.366
It's really a joke when you say something like that.

10
00:00:16.366 --> 00:00:17.400
prince

11
00:00:17.966 --> 00:00:19.200
Don't be impulsive

12
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.966
I also ask my father and the ministers to be captains together

13
00:00:22.966 --> 00:00:23.900
Your Majesty

14
00:00:24.466 --> 00:00:25.633
That being the case

15
00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:28.466
I'd like to see what the prince can do

16
00:00:28.466 --> 00:00:30.900
If the general can't even win the crown prince

17
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.300
I would like to burn all the books

18
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:34.666
Stop reading

19
00:00:34.666 --> 00:00:35.966
Get a pen and paper

20
00:00:36.933 --> 00:00:39.100
No matter whether the son goes first

21
00:00:48.266 --> 00:00:50.600
Yesterday, I told us in advance about the administration of Fang Xiaotu

22
00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:51.600
Asshole prince

23
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.566
What would that lead to?

24
00:00:54.166 --> 00:00:55.733
Nothing more than great joy

25
00:00:55.733 --> 00:00:56.533
But

26
00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.366
How things go

27
00:00:58.366 --> 00:00:59.966
Much smoother than we imagined

28
00:00:59.966 --> 00:01:01.700
He was angrily reprimanded by Fang Daru

29
00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:02.733
More than that

30
00:01:02.733 --> 00:01:04.200
Fang Daru said he didn't learn martial arts

31
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:05.100
No ink

32
00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.133
When the temple refused to add him to the post

33
00:01:07.133 --> 00:01:08.466
Good.

34
00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.200
He's good

35
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.000
I don't know how much I weigh

36
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.400
Facing the Poetry Assessment Proposed by Fang Daru

37
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.833
You're talking nonsense

38
00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.100
What do you want to teach the great Tathagata Fang to write poetry?

39
00:01:19.133 --> 00:01:22.100
Isn't this a taboo for people who skate the world?
