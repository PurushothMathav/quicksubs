00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.200
His Royal Highness the Crown Prince is so ignorant and arrogant

2
00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:03.900
Start writing without even thinking about it

3
00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:06.000
Hmph, if you can write an article like this

4
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.666
That pig can also write articles

5
00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:08.900
His Royal Highness

6
00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:10.766
You want to be in the limelight too much

7
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.533
This genius can only be a seven-step poem

8
00:00:13.533 --> 00:00:14.900
You blink and become a god

9
00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:16.166
Hahaha

10
00:00:16.166 --> 00:00:19.166
I'm afraid I have to smile generously, hahaha.

11
00:00:23.133 --> 00:00:25.266
Mr. Fan, take a look

12
00:00:28.533 --> 00:00:29.466
OK

13
00:00:34.266 --> 00:00:35.466
Light up the sword

14
00:00:35.666 --> 00:00:37.300
Dream back to blowing horns

15
00:00:37.533 --> 00:00:38.966
Eight hundred miles of ash

16
00:00:38.966 --> 00:00:40.400
It's not annoying

17
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.500
The autumn soldiers in the battlefield are strong and the enemy dragon is fast

18
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.233
Attack like a thunderbolt

19
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.033
End the king's affairs

20
00:00:47.133 --> 00:00:49.500
Win the sage and I am transparent

21
00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:51.600
Poor white hair

22
00:00:52.366 --> 00:00:54.266
How is that possible?

23
00:00:54.266 --> 00:00:56.433
There is such a masterpiece in the world

24
00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.866
The child winks and writes such a masterpiece

25
00:00:59.166 --> 00:01:01.666
I thought the prince was ignorant

26
00:01:01.666 --> 00:01:03.100
I'm stupid

27
00:01:03.466 --> 00:01:04.566
His Royal Highness

28
00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:07.033
It's over.

29
00:01:07.933 --> 00:01:09.833
Watch the king's affairs

30
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.833
Medical ethics before and after

31
00:01:11.933 --> 00:01:13.400
Poor white hair

32
00:01:13.566 --> 00:01:14.666
Well written

33
00:01:14.733 --> 00:01:16.066
His Royal Highness the Crown Prince

34
00:01:16.066 --> 00:01:18.200
Information His Royal Highness the Crown Prince's literary talent today

35
00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.466
Caotang Baiguan

36
00:01:20.133 --> 00:01:22.300
Not even a single hair of His Royal Highness the Crown Prince

37
00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:23.133
That's impossible.

38
00:01:23.133 --> 00:01:24.900
How could he write such a work?

39
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.766
Even Fang Xiaotu lost
