1
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.266
Adding an official to the prince is my prosperous age

2
00:00:06.266 --> 00:00:09.200
In front of you all today

3
00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:14.366
There is my teacher, Mr. Fang, who personally added officials to the prince

4
00:00:14.366 --> 00:00:16.966
Mr. Zhenfa added an official to the prince

5
00:00:17.933 --> 00:00:19.500
Mr. Fang?

6
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.900
His Majesty's minister refused to add an official to the prince

7
00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.400
Mr. Fang, this is no child's play

8
00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:26.300
Your Majesty

9
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.200
The prince has no ink and no skills

10
00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.600
The aggression that increased his position and humiliated his ministers

11
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.066
Chen Ning refused to obey

12
00:00:34.066 --> 00:00:35.700
Legal history is also correct

13
00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.333
I have never seen the prince read

14
00:00:37.333 --> 00:00:39.066
Mr. Fang is known as the saint of the Lu family

15
00:00:39.066 --> 00:00:41.166
Ask him to give a view of an ignorant family

16
00:00:41.166 --> 00:00:44.400
I'm afraid I can calm my anger better than killing him

17
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.533
The minister also did not read poetry for the Prince of Great Xia

18
00:00:47.533 --> 00:00:49.733
A tyrant who only kills ministers

19
00:00:49.733 --> 00:00:52.900
Such a person cannot be a traitor to my building

20
00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:54.833
Prince Fang Xiaopu

21
00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.066
You are talking nonsense

22
00:00:57.133 --> 00:00:58.033
Your Majesty

23
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.200
The minister is willing to bet with the prince

24
00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.300
If the prince could use the killing field as a topic

25
00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.433
Compose a poem from the past on the spot

26
00:01:05.733 --> 00:01:08.566
I am willing to kneel down and apologize on the spot

27
00:01:08.966 --> 00:01:09.900
If not

28
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.766
The minister cannot be promoted for him

29
00:01:12.766 --> 00:01:15.900
Mr. Fang keeps saying that I have no ink on my chest

30
00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.033
ignorant

31
00:01:17.133 --> 00:01:19.733
I will teach Mr. Fang today

32
00:01:19.733 --> 00:01:21.833
What is true poetry?
