00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:02.600
Humph, the dead can't come back to life

2
00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:06.000
His Highness went his own way and killed my only son

3
00:00:06.533 --> 00:00:08.600
Apologize now

4
00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:11.500
The anger in Old Man Nanping's heart

5
00:00:11.733 --> 00:00:14.266
Hugh'er has always regarded you as a senior

6
00:00:14.266 --> 00:00:16.633
But what he did

7
00:00:17.133 --> 00:00:18.366
Really impulsive

8
00:00:18.366 --> 00:00:19.866
Elder hum

9
00:00:19.866 --> 00:00:21.300
I fought for many years

10
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:22.633
Make great contributions

11
00:00:22.866 --> 00:00:25.200
Even you have to give me three points to make up for it

12
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.300
Does His Royal Highness regard me as an elder?

13
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:29.366
His Royal Highness

14
00:00:29.366 --> 00:00:32.500
Do you think this product is so rampant?

15
00:00:32.533 --> 00:00:34.233
It's a matter of waiting

16
00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.700
Today, I have to teach you how to be a person

17
00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.166
Xiuer, go and apologize to your uncle.

18
00:00:39.166 --> 00:00:40.300
Just an apology.

19
00:00:41.166 --> 00:00:42.666
The Crown Prince killed my son

20
00:00:42.666 --> 00:00:44.100
Pay the price

21
00:00:44.533 --> 00:00:45.733
I can't accept it.

22
00:00:45.733 --> 00:00:47.666
So what do you mean?

23
00:00:47.666 --> 00:00:51.100
I want His Royal Highness to inform the whole world

24
00:00:51.266 --> 00:00:52.600
He is immoral and incompetent

25
00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.500
And he wants to lose the crown prince's position himself

26
00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.866
Otherwise, the anger in my heart will never go away.

27
00:00:58.866 --> 00:01:01.100
Xiuer, go and apologize to your uncle

28
00:01:01.133 --> 00:01:04.400
Yes, His Royal Highness, let's not mention the matter of abolishing the prince first

29
00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.200
But in this matter, do you still want the prince to make amends?

30
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.166
Apologize for what?

31
00:01:11.733 --> 00:01:15.033
The fool doesn't know how to give in until he's about to die
