00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.000
Okay, then I'll be a rich woman

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.566
Solve it well

3
00:00:07.466 --> 00:00:08.600
Are you ready?

4
00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:10.533
How are you going to feed me?

5
00:00:10.533 --> 00:00:11.333
poisoning

6
00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.200
It's just a temporary red poison from eating chili peppers

7
00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.266
You are not as hot as yourself

8
00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:17.833
You bastard

9
00:00:18.066 --> 00:00:20.000
Haha, come from afar.

10
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.300
Prince Sang

11
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:22.966
Thank you for your hard work, Mr. Fang.

12
00:00:22.966 --> 00:00:24.800
To be able to meet Mr. Fang in person

13
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.600
Listening to Mr. Fang's teachings along the way

14
00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.066
I am honored to be in the ranks

15
00:00:28.166 --> 00:00:29.133
How can you talk about hard work?

16
00:00:29.133 --> 00:00:31.766
The third prince is kind and profound

17
00:00:31.766 --> 00:00:34.666
So good, what else can I teach?

18
00:00:34.666 --> 00:00:36.000
What Mr. Fang said is

19
00:00:36.166 --> 00:00:38.533
The third prince has been both civil and military since he was a child

20
00:00:38.533 --> 00:00:39.666
Expo

21
00:00:39.766 --> 00:00:41.200
Only then can you be famous in the capital?

22
00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.933
It's a pity that His Majesty is getting old

23
00:00:43.933 --> 00:00:44.666
Some crashes

24
00:00:44.666 --> 00:00:48.000
I just chose an unlearned and diligent cultivator to be the prince

25
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.100
So I have long heard that the overseer of the dynasty

26
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.900
The prince's supervision of the country is less than a month

27
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.333
I killed several eldest sisters

28
00:00:53.333 --> 00:00:54.266
So cruel

29
00:00:54.266 --> 00:00:56.166
It must be chest soil without any ink

30
00:00:56.166 --> 00:00:58.600
How can such a person be a prince?

31
00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.300
What did Mr. Fang say?

32
00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:01.933
My unlearned brother

33
00:01:01.933 --> 00:01:03.000
I grew up not even reading books

34
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.766
And beat away 5 teachers

35
00:01:04.766 --> 00:01:06.366
It's just that the father is too biased

36
00:01:06.366 --> 00:01:07.766
I developed my current life

37
00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:08.900
Let him go tomorrow

38
00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:09.733
His home management

39
00:01:09.733 --> 00:01:12.100
I will definitely let His Majesty and the literati of the world

40
00:01:12.133 --> 00:01:14.400
You must be able to see him clearly

41
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.666
Let him get out of the East Palace in disgrace
