1
00:00:00.566 --> 00:00:02.266
Your Majesty, think again.

2
00:00:02.466 --> 00:00:05.166
The military general holds half of the tiger talismans of Great Xia

3
00:00:05.733 --> 00:00:08.066
If given to such a stupid person

4
00:00:08.166 --> 00:00:10.266
How can you protect me from Daxia Kingdom?

5
00:00:11.166 --> 00:00:12.366
A gentleman's word

6
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:13.866
Horses are hard to chase

7
00:00:14.266 --> 00:00:15.400
His Royal Highness

8
00:00:15.866 --> 00:00:17.200
Can't you go back on it?

9
00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:18.600
I'm not finished yet.

10
00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:20.766
If you can't answer

11
00:00:20.966 --> 00:00:22.266
According to the law

12
00:00:22.266 --> 00:00:23.633
You are thinking about Wu Bi

13
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.766
Breaking the law is a punishment

14
00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:28.933
How dare you kill me?

15
00:00:28.933 --> 00:00:31.000
My father and Yan Xiao are still by my side

16
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.866
They won't let you do it

17
00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:33.966
His Royal Highness

18
00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:35.500
Needless to say

19
00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:36.766
Just ask

20
00:00:36.766 --> 00:00:38.966
Ok then I'll ask you

21
00:00:39.266 --> 00:00:40.800
You are the champion

22
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.266
Presumably talented

23
00:00:42.266 --> 00:00:43.266
full of economy

24
00:00:43.466 --> 00:00:44.800
I'd like to hear it

25
00:00:44.866 --> 00:00:47.800
How did you do on this answer sheet?

26
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.400
His Royal Highness Prince Yanxia is asking Qin Wei

27
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.100
What are you in such a hurry for?

28
00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.400
Know why you can't be

29
00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.966
Because you exchanged a poor child

30
00:01:00.966 --> 00:01:02.100
Hu Zhongliang's Me

31
00:01:03.066 --> 00:01:04.166
People like you

32
00:01:04.166 --> 00:01:05.900
If you can be the champion

33
00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.766
Where are the people with lofty ideals in the world?

34
00:01:08.766 --> 00:01:10.166
So what?

35
00:01:10.166 --> 00:01:11.066
Poor disciple

36
00:01:11.066 --> 00:01:13.266
Their fates were sealed by execution at birth

37
00:01:13.933 --> 00:01:16.633
Is to be a stepping stone for us

38
00:01:17.766 --> 00:01:19.466
People like him

39
00:01:19.866 --> 00:01:23.400
Even as one of the three great talents in the capital

40
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.266
So what?

41
00:01:24.266 --> 00:01:25.433
No money, no power

42
00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:26.566
To the end

43
00:01:27.166 --> 00:01:28.966
Look at my face.

44
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.033
Shameless as you say

45
00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.433
I set up the imperial examination

46
00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.766
Recruit the children of the world's cold text to enter the room

47
00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:37.366
It was a joke.

48
00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.266
These transverse acid people

49
00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.800
I can't get on the table
