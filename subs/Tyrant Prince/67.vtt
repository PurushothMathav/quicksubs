00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:02.800
His Royal Highness the Crown Prince Yan Song asked for a meeting

2
00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:04.533
They were in this together.

3
00:00:04.533 --> 00:00:06.133
And I consider myself noble

4
00:00:06.133 --> 00:00:08.500
Since I can take the initiative to find His Highness

5
00:00:08.533 --> 00:00:09.500
There must be a trick

6
00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:12.633
Don't be afraid to see what they want to do first

7
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.233
The two of you go to the Three Treasures Hall for nothing

8
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.766
What's the matter? Congratulations to His Royal Highness the Crown Prince

9
00:00:18.766 --> 00:00:22.000
Recover the assets of Luoluo City and Linzhou City

10
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.600
The situation in the second city is complicated

11
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:26.166
I would like to recommend some places to visit

12
00:00:26.166 --> 00:00:28.033
Share for His Royal Highness the Crown Prince

13
00:00:28.066 --> 00:00:29.233
Always said

14
00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:30.866
It's what I have in mind

15
00:00:30.866 --> 00:00:32.700
The two of you are so anxious to share the worries for the country

16
00:00:32.933 --> 00:00:36.166
Then why did you meet Daijin Imperial Preceptor just now?

17
00:00:36.166 --> 00:00:37.900
I haven't seen you so active.

18
00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:39.033
His Royal Highness

19
00:00:39.466 --> 00:00:42.666
Are you asking me for the truth?

20
00:00:42.666 --> 00:00:43.600
How come?

21
00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.400
Now who doesn't know the gold led by the face

22
00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.433
The country is so loyal

23
00:00:48.866 --> 00:00:51.900
His Royal Highness the Crown Prince must not act out of emotion at this time

24
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:54.666
North Korea and China can now go to the border

25
00:00:54.666 --> 00:00:55.600
So a couple.

26
00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:57.666
What the image says is

27
00:00:57.733 --> 00:01:01.100
I sincerely fear that no one will be available to recommend talents

28
00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.400
Unexpectedly, His Royal Highness the Crown Prince's response made the old man

29
00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.166
It's really cold

30
00:01:06.333 --> 00:01:07.733
I used your people

31
00:01:07.733 --> 00:01:09.100
I'm afraid it won't be two days.

32
00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:10.900
The city has been sold by you for thousands

33
00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:12.866
Then don't bother you two

34
00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:13.700
with

35
00:01:14.066 --> 00:01:15.866
Generation Chen passed on my order

36
00:01:15.866 --> 00:01:18.633
After five days, the imperial examinations will be piloted in Beijing

37
00:01:18.733 --> 00:01:21.300
All children of poor families can sign up

38
00:01:21.366 --> 00:01:23.466
Pick the winner for admission

39
00:01:26.733 --> 00:01:28.233
His Royal Highness the Crown Prince is wise

40
00:01:28.333 --> 00:01:29.500
minister and other nobles

41
00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:32.900
Mei Xiang

42
00:01:32.966 --> 00:01:35.866
Why didn't you stop this kid just now haha

43
00:01:36.533 --> 00:01:37.900
Better to lose than to gamble

44
00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.200
Moreover, the imperial examination this life

45
00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.500
Do you think he really has what he says?

46
00:01:42.666 --> 00:01:45.000
Hahaha who to choose?

47
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.266
It's not up to him to decide what to do

48
00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.000
The force that presides over this matter is the person who is the original

49
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.433
Hahahahaha
