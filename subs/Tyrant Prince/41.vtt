00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.500
How dare he speak to Fang Daru like that?

2
00:00:02.733 --> 00:00:04.266
Do you still have a brain?

3
00:00:04.533 --> 00:00:06.366
That's contemporary

4
00:00:06.466 --> 00:00:08.666
The picture shows the direction of Renfang Ruoshen cotton

5
00:00:08.666 --> 00:00:10.100
Anyone who is not a fool

6
00:00:10.166 --> 00:00:11.833
I wouldn't say that.

7
00:00:11.866 --> 00:00:15.000
I think he's just been doing it for too long

8
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.666
I don't even know my last name

9
00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:18.700
Because anything can be solved by power.

10
00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:21.900
This time, Mr. Fang will definitely punish him severely

11
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:23.666
He insulted Lord Fang

12
00:00:23.733 --> 00:00:26.100
It is to offend all those who read in the world

13
00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:27.900
He got the book right.

14
00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.066
It will be sent to the fire of the human genus of the world

15
00:00:30.066 --> 00:00:31.366
I watch this time

16
00:00:31.366 --> 00:00:33.900
Even if this prince Qin Xiulingping cares

17
00:00:34.366 --> 00:00:36.800
The man who reads will also unload him and marry him

18
00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.500
Even the old emperor couldn't save him

19
00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.366
That offended the emperor and countless scholars

20
00:00:43.366 --> 00:00:45.566
All the civil servants of the dynasty

21
00:00:45.933 --> 00:00:47.233
What do you want to do?

22
00:00:47.333 --> 00:00:49.466
Challenging direction in poetry

23
00:00:49.466 --> 00:00:50.800
no amateur

24
00:00:50.933 --> 00:00:52.033
Accumulate food

25
00:00:52.333 --> 00:00:53.633
How can we do this?

26
00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:01.766
Since it's a bet

27
00:01:01.766 --> 00:01:03.866
Then it is realized with a stick of incense

28
00:01:04.066 --> 00:01:06.866
Mr. Fang, what does His Royal Highness the Crown Prince think?

29
00:01:06.866 --> 00:01:08.700
This trash, let alone a stick of incense

30
00:01:08.766 --> 00:01:11.266
Give him a day and a night without a word

31
00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:13.200
This time he humiliated himself

32
00:01:13.466 --> 00:01:14.133
So

33
00:01:14.133 --> 00:01:16.866
It depends on whether His Royal Highness can write it out

34
00:01:16.866 --> 00:01:17.966
If you can't write it

35
00:01:17.966 --> 00:01:20.000
I can change it to one day.

36
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.500
If His Royal Highness cannot write it

37
00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.500
Delay as long as you want

38
00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.633
The old man will accompany you to the end

39
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:26.900
Why do you need a stick of incense?

40
00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:28.200
Time warp

41
00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.100
A battlefield poem comes with a pen
