00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.433
You're not trying to take the opportunity to win me over, are you?

2
00:00:03.466 --> 00:00:05.100
I am the prince

3
00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.300
Of course I won't use this kind of nonsense

4
00:00:07.566 --> 00:00:10.500
Why is your prejudice against me so much?

5
00:00:10.533 --> 00:00:12.300
Stop pretending

6
00:00:12.566 --> 00:00:14.066
You as the prince

7
00:00:14.066 --> 00:00:17.233
On the surface, imperial examinations were carried out to recruit children from poor families

8
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.666
In fact, dark incense operation

9
00:00:19.733 --> 00:00:21.233
I have long been operating with dark incense

10
00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.200
The imperial examinations have just ended

11
00:00:23.733 --> 00:00:25.700
You ordered an exchange of events

12
00:00:26.066 --> 00:00:28.966
The masterpieces of the children of the poor have become princes and nobles

13
00:00:28.966 --> 00:00:31.566
What to say I have a friend

14
00:00:31.566 --> 00:00:34.633
It is Wu Zhongyong, the three great talents of Jinzhong

15
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.000
However

16
00:00:36.133 --> 00:00:39.966
The world that can be lifted is rang by the tip of Iwamatsu

17
00:00:40.066 --> 00:00:43.200
The big scroll person has also been replaced by the son of the official servant

18
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.600
Chen Deliyi's name

19
00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.500
You're not going to sue?

20
00:00:46.733 --> 00:00:49.500
The county magistrate is gone for decoration

21
00:00:52.066 --> 00:00:54.066
If it doesn't work

22
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.966
There's a lot of bureaucracy around the world.

23
00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.433
There are many poor children

24
00:01:00.866 --> 00:01:02.500
Want to speak up for your peers

25
00:01:02.566 --> 00:01:03.866
Go to the county office to complain

26
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:06.666
But they were all beaten out by the stick bully

27
00:01:06.666 --> 00:01:09.100
I'm still lying in bed and can't run

28
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:10.600
Okay, Sanye

29
00:01:13.666 --> 00:01:15.100
go to great lengths

30
00:01:15.733 --> 00:01:17.000
election

31
00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.666
Unexpectedly, it was a villain

32
00:01:21.066 --> 00:01:22.766
Faked

33
00:01:36.066 --> 00:01:37.100
Check tomorrow morning

34
00:01:37.766 --> 00:01:39.066
You confront me together

35
00:01:39.066 --> 00:01:40.466
Officials responsible for resigning

36
00:01:40.533 --> 00:01:44.666
Let's see who's messing around
