00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:02.233
frying pan

2
00:00:09.933 --> 00:00:12.566
Since everyone says they have a fiercely loyal

3
00:00:12.566 --> 00:00:14.233
Especially the royal family

4
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.100
Then I'd like to see how much you think the center is

5
00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:20.600
prince

6
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.266
We wait for the center of the world to learn from

7
00:00:23.566 --> 00:00:27.000
My father taught me to be loyal and patriotic since I was a child

8
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.166
I also got ear insults

9
00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:33.666
I have vowed to go through fire and water for the imperial family all my life

10
00:00:34.333 --> 00:00:35.966
Your Highness, with all due respect

11
00:00:35.966 --> 00:00:38.133
To want to open the imperial examination to believe in the poor door

12
00:00:38.133 --> 00:00:40.566
And do not believe in the actions of the nobles of our country

13
00:00:40.566 --> 00:00:42.266
It's really a waste of money.

14
00:00:42.466 --> 00:00:44.033
Yan Xiang's words are bad

15
00:00:44.166 --> 00:00:46.600
How many poor people have I laid down?

16
00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.833
Are we not loyal to the army and patriotic?

17
00:00:52.166 --> 00:00:53.266
That's me!

18
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:55.700
Some people

19
00:00:56.533 --> 00:00:58.600
It's just what it says

20
00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.033
The so-called poor life scheme

21
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:04.566
God knows these poor untouchables from small to large

22
00:01:04.566 --> 00:01:07.166
How much trouble is in this stomach?

23
00:01:07.266 --> 00:01:08.100
In my opinion

24
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.266
These poor and poor people in this court

25
00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:12.700
both should

26
00:01:13.866 --> 00:01:16.200
You're right, loyalty comes first

27
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.300
They grew up far away in the rude countryside

28
00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:21.700
Nature South and Gold International are so close as royalty

29
00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.033
More loyal

30
00:01:24.133 --> 00:01:25.266
No need to fight

31
00:01:25.966 --> 00:01:28.600
The oil pan is boiling.

32
00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:32.100
One by one, you all said that you wish to be a heaven

33
00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.966
Allegiance to death now

34
00:01:44.266 --> 00:01:46.966
Which loyal minister is reaching in for

35
00:01:47.366 --> 00:01:49.000
Take this big summer imperial wash

36
00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:50.866
Take it out
