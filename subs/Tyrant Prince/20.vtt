00:00:03.666 --> 00:00:04.566
Hey, concubine

2
00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.300
What I asked you to prepare is ready

3
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:07.800
Ready? Okay.

4
00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.966
Then we're ready for the show

5
00:00:09.966 --> 00:00:11.500
Your Highness really doesn't need to send additional Jin Wen

6
00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:13.066
Is there no East Palace guard in the army?

7
00:00:13.333 --> 00:00:15.200
It's too risky just the two of us.

8
00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.800
How can they be so easily fooled if they don't take risks?

9
00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.866
What's more, we have rifles in hand

10
00:00:19.866 --> 00:00:21.266
No matter how much conscience they have

11
00:00:21.266 --> 00:00:21.866
Can see

12
00:00:21.866 --> 00:00:24.900
His Highness is so confident in this sniper rifle?

13
00:00:25.766 --> 00:00:27.133
The concubine's skills have not been restored

14
00:00:27.133 --> 00:00:28.700
I can only deal with it for a while

15
00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:30.766
Soon you will know the power of this one

16
00:00:30.766 --> 00:00:32.500
Let's look at what's called dimensionality reduction.

17
00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:33.966
After the scene of the subordinates comes up

18
00:00:33.966 --> 00:00:35.800
I'm also going to build a special forces unit

19
00:00:36.066 --> 00:00:38.600
His Highness the Special Forces is talking nonsense again

20
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.500
This rifle really doesn't seem to be lethal

21
00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:42.600
Too risky

22
00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:44.733
Forget it, I die tonight

23
00:00:44.733 --> 00:00:46.466
His Royal Highness the Crown Prince accompanies him to go crazy once

24
00:00:58.766 --> 00:00:59.566
Yan Fei

25
00:01:00.066 --> 00:01:02.766
I want you to serve me tonight

26
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.500
His Royal Highness

27
00:01:04.733 --> 00:01:06.900
The concubine is coming to the moon today

28
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.400
It's really inconvenient to worry about you.

29
00:01:14.533 --> 00:01:15.666
Are dying

30
00:01:15.666 --> 00:01:17.066
What else can you do with these?

31
00:01:17.066 --> 00:01:19.100
Plus tonight is exactly a hundred days

32
00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:20.566
It's time to read French names

33
00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:28.966
Your Highness, Crown Prince, what's the matter with you?

34
00:01:29.266 --> 00:01:31.100
Let's go, sir, let's go, sir

35
00:01:31.533 --> 00:01:32.333
Your Highness

36
00:01:33.166 --> 00:01:34.500
What happened to His Royal Highness the Crown Prince?

37
00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.400
Don't run away from you today

38
00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.000
Don't blame my men for being ruthless

39
00:01:39.933 --> 00:01:41.766
His Highness does not love me

40
00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.833
Waste tonight is your death
