00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:03.133
Your Highness, where is your carriage now?

2
00:00:03.133 --> 00:00:06.200
My carriage must be parked outside the palace

3
00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:07.433
Don't be too happy

4
00:00:07.466 --> 00:00:08.966
Do you want to see it?

5
00:00:08.966 --> 00:00:10.400
The missile I just told you about

6
00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.466
If you have the ability, take it out and let me see it.

7
00:00:13.466 --> 00:00:15.633
I was afraid to scare you before

8
00:00:15.733 --> 00:00:18.166
I'll show you now

9
00:00:18.166 --> 00:00:20.633
Li Qianren is launching

10
00:00:21.066 --> 00:00:22.500
False life experience

11
00:00:23.066 --> 00:00:24.000
Could it be that

12
00:00:24.533 --> 00:00:26.400
This guy is a scourge

13
00:00:30.933 --> 00:00:32.500
Hey, hot summer

14
00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:34.133
Why do you have to die?

15
00:00:34.133 --> 00:00:35.533
Is this sound wrong?

16
00:00:35.533 --> 00:00:37.166
Why is it just ringing?

17
00:00:37.266 --> 00:00:38.500
It's moving.

18
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.066
Chen just didn't stand still

19
00:00:42.066 --> 00:00:44.866
Xiuer, what missile are you talking about?

20
00:00:44.966 --> 00:00:47.000
It is so powerful

21
00:00:47.333 --> 00:00:49.566
This is far from the power of missiles

22
00:00:49.566 --> 00:00:50.800
Such a big movement

23
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:51.666
Except for the burrow

24
00:00:51.766 --> 00:00:53.200
There is no other possibility

25
00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.366
How could it be caused by some missile?

26
00:00:55.366 --> 00:00:58.266
Qin Xiu, stop pretending to be a ghost in front of me

27
00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.233
Oh, my good uncle.

28
00:01:00.266 --> 00:01:02.500
You've heard the sound, why don't you believe it?

29
00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:03.166
Never mind.

30
00:01:03.166 --> 00:01:05.400
I'll show you what a big scene is

31
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.666
Li Qian, what happened just now?

32
00:01:08.166 --> 00:01:10.200
His Royal Highness the Crown Prince just got crooked

33
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.500
This time, thank you

34
00:01:18.066 --> 00:01:18.933
Uncle Wang?

35
00:01:18.933 --> 00:01:22.766
Now your carriage has been shredded by red dust
