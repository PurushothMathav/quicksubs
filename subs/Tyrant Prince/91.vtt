00:00:00.466 --> 00:00:01.600
Could it be that

2
00:00:02.333 --> 00:00:04.266
He gave me a fake photo to

3
00:00:04.266 --> 00:00:06.733
To use your mother and son as guns

4
00:00:06.733 --> 00:00:07.966
No wonder.

5
00:00:08.933 --> 00:00:12.166
Now he's headed to the border with a fake photo book

6
00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.833
Open the door and collude with the gold people

7
00:00:15.333 --> 00:00:19.033
With his 50,000 soldiers, he plans to besiege the capital

8
00:00:19.866 --> 00:00:21.566
Until then

9
00:00:21.933 --> 00:00:24.600
Where can my son be the emperor?

10
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:25.666
Now the princess

11
00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:27.633
Finally woke up

12
00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:31.566
But my Daxia Dynasty troops are limited

13
00:00:31.566 --> 00:00:32.700
His Royal Highness

14
00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.800
It's too late to stop Yansong now

15
00:00:35.966 --> 00:00:38.066
Why don't you seem in a hurry?

16
00:00:38.333 --> 00:00:39.600
Hmm urgent

17
00:00:39.933 --> 00:00:40.900
What's the hurry?

18
00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:42.200
Didn't he die fast enough?

19
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:43.766
The concubine does not understand

20
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:48.433
There are so many things you don't understand

21
00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:49.633
It won't be long

22
00:00:49.733 --> 00:00:52.900
The serious old man will end up like his son

23
00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:57.500
yuxin

24
00:00:57.766 --> 00:00:58.100
account

25
00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.000
Are you and the consumer special forces trained?

26
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.033
Report that His Highness is already ready to go

27
00:01:04.133 --> 00:01:07.700
Just wait for His Highness to give an order

28
00:01:07.866 --> 00:01:09.566
As expected of my right-hand man

29
00:01:10.466 --> 00:01:11.800
It's really efficient.

30
00:01:12.166 --> 00:01:14.033
Really impressive

31
00:01:14.166 --> 00:01:17.100
Now I'm waiting for that old traitor Iwamatsu

32
00:01:17.133 --> 00:01:20.066
With golden thorns

33
00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.500
No, there's one more thing to do.

34
00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.400
Weichen doesn't understand

35
00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:25.633
Seriously enter Beijing

36
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.033
Must rescue the eyeshadow print first

37
00:01:28.133 --> 00:01:30.100
Otherwise, for the sake of the world

38
00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:32.200
Abandoned his own daughter

39
00:01:32.666 --> 00:01:35.333
How bad this is for Rock Lane's reputation

40
00:01:35.333 --> 00:01:37.966
Let's go, let's go to the meeting
