1
00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:04.766
His Royal Highness

2
00:00:05.133 --> 00:00:07.166
The concubine heard a message

3
00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.000
Love the concubine, but it doesn't matter

4
00:00:09.766 --> 00:00:12.566
The concubine heard that Zhuge Liang, one of the three great talents in the capital

5
00:00:12.566 --> 00:00:13.800
At the palace gate

6
00:00:13.933 --> 00:00:16.466
He scolded His Royal Highness the Crown Prince and Ke Ju

7
00:00:16.466 --> 00:00:18.866
That's all he said

8
00:00:19.866 --> 00:00:20.700
What did he say?

9
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:22.933
He also said that the prince is just an incompetent person

10
00:00:22.933 --> 00:00:24.500
Playing with the imperial examinations

11
00:00:24.933 --> 00:00:27.366
Empress Dowager, shouldn't you?

12
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:28.700
I do imperial examinations

13
00:00:28.933 --> 00:00:31.733
The poor disciples of Jianju should praise me

14
00:00:31.733 --> 00:00:33.166
Where is Zhuge Liang now?

15
00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:35.266
In Sirius he insulted His Royal Highness the Crown Prince

16
00:00:35.266 --> 00:00:37.700
So he was captured by the elite guards at the entrance of the palace

17
00:00:37.966 --> 00:00:39.166
Ah put on

18
00:00:42.066 --> 00:00:42.866
kneel down

19
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:45.200
ask you

20
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.666
If the hero falls to someone like you in the future, it will benefit

21
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.766
Wang Jun was rude

22
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.000
Don't be afraid that I will kill you with five orders

23
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.066
I bah

24
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.466
The head can be broken and the blood can flow

25
00:00:56.466 --> 00:00:58.100
I can't lose Sister Ren Qi

26
00:00:58.333 --> 00:00:59.400
Even if you die

27
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.966
He also died for all the poor disciples in the world

28
00:01:02.066 --> 00:01:04.100
It's better to die

29
00:01:04.333 --> 00:01:07.400
Unexpectedly, Zhuge Liang, one of the three great talents in the capital

30
00:01:07.566 --> 00:01:09.700
It's such a powerful thing

31
00:01:18.266 --> 00:01:19.366
Why don't you kill me?

32
00:01:19.366 --> 00:01:20.766
You said it yourself

33
00:01:20.766 --> 00:01:23.066
It is to stand up for the children of the poor family in the world

34
00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:24.533
Why should I kill you?

35
00:01:24.533 --> 00:01:26.000
Come sit here
