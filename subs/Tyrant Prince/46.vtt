1
00:00:02.266 --> 00:00:04.866
Let's discuss the imperial examination with you today

2
00:00:04.866 --> 00:00:06.266
So what do you think?

3
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:08.100
minister against minister

4
00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:11.066
If you are against it, then say it well

5
00:00:11.066 --> 00:00:14.133
I should let someone who can manage the country

6
00:00:14.133 --> 00:00:16.933
Those untouchables have neither knowledge nor discipline

7
00:00:16.933 --> 00:00:18.900
It will only miss me

8
00:00:19.366 --> 00:00:20.600
This man was born

9
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:21.966
perform their duties

10
00:00:21.966 --> 00:00:25.166
Seeing the people should do what the people should do

11
00:00:25.566 --> 00:00:26.700
This governs the country

12
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:29.600
You also have to let those who come from powerful backgrounds

13
00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:31.700
The third prince's words are bad

14
00:00:31.766 --> 00:00:32.733
The poor are also human

15
00:00:32.733 --> 00:00:34.300
As long as you are willing to read and learn

16
00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:35.866
What's the difference between you and me?

17
00:00:35.866 --> 00:00:36.666
Yu Qian

18
00:00:37.066 --> 00:00:38.566
If memory serves

19
00:00:38.766 --> 00:00:40.333
You too were born into a cold family.

20
00:00:40.333 --> 00:00:41.133
how

21
00:00:41.733 --> 00:00:43.866
The sword leaves the fog and tears rise

22
00:00:44.066 --> 00:00:45.600
The Prosperity of the Third Prince

23
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:46.333
Besides

24
00:00:46.333 --> 00:00:48.600
Today's officials are capable of doing anything

25
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.166
Hirata officials instead increased financial spending

26
00:00:51.366 --> 00:00:52.533
Design for Jiangshan

27
00:00:52.533 --> 00:00:54.000
I hope His Royal Highness the Crown Prince will think again.

28
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:54.966
Don't be noisy.

29
00:00:54.966 --> 00:00:55.900
From today onwards

30
00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:58.400
All officials will do their own thing

31
00:00:58.466 --> 00:00:59.766
Will be reported in the daily newspaper

32
00:01:00.466 --> 00:01:02.166
One monthly report per month

33
00:01:02.266 --> 00:01:03.900
I will arrange the appointment supervision

34
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:05.233
If fake

35
00:01:05.333 --> 00:01:06.600
Falling to the earth and bullying the monarch to return to His Highness

36
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:07.633
Officials at all levels

37
00:01:07.766 --> 00:01:10.333
Are you aware of the matters within your jurisdiction?

38
00:01:10.333 --> 00:01:11.066
processing method

39
00:01:11.066 --> 00:01:12.000
deal with soil

40
00:01:12.066 --> 00:01:14.000
Will be reported in the daily monthly report

41
00:01:14.133 --> 00:01:15.200
His Royal Highness

42
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.366
We have never had a precedent for such a thing

43
00:01:17.366 --> 00:01:19.400
If there is no precedent, then set a precedent

44
00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:20.600
Execute now

45
00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:21.866
Since you can do it

46
00:01:21.866 --> 00:01:23.500
There's almost a solution.

47
00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.666
If you can't solve it, then go home and gamble

48
00:01:27.066 --> 00:01:29.200
Ok really
