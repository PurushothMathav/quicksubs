00:00:00.666 --> 00:00:01.633
Kill you

2
00:00:03.333 --> 00:00:05.266
I have endured you for a long time

3
00:00:05.766 --> 00:00:06.800
It's like my quest.

4
00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:09.266
Who wouldn't hurt my child?

5
00:00:09.333 --> 00:00:11.700
Who dares to harm him, I will fight with whom

6
00:00:13.733 --> 00:00:14.800
Early knowledge today

7
00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:15.800
Why did you

8
00:00:16.566 --> 00:00:17.466
Back off

9
00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:24.666
I know it will weigh me

10
00:00:24.766 --> 00:00:27.466
The queen is willing to accompany the ancient Buddha with green lanterns

11
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.633
I beg you to let my child live

12
00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.033
It's okay to let go

13
00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.066
It is unnecessary to always accompany the ancient Buddha of youth

14
00:00:36.066 --> 00:00:37.266
What do you say baby

15
00:00:38.266 --> 00:00:41.266
Your Highness, I am convinced

16
00:00:47.333 --> 00:00:49.200
Now you can tell me.

17
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.000
What is Iwamatsu trying to do?

18
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.300
Iwamatsu wants to oppose it?

19
00:00:53.866 --> 00:00:54.866
Finally

20
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.766
His Royal Highness seems to be eager for him to resist

21
00:00:58.133 --> 00:00:59.300
Not really.

22
00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.900
It's just that I'm thinking about all the nonsense he's been talking about lately

23
00:01:02.966 --> 00:01:05.066
It can't be used as a wedding dress for others, right?

24
00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.200
Did he give me a fake photo to
