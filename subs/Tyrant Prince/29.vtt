00:00:04.333 --> 00:00:06.500
Your Highness, what's the matter with you?

2
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:08.466
Damn Zhao Hui

3
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.233
As a Chinese minister

4
00:00:10.266 --> 00:00:11.700
How dare you hide the flood?

5
00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:14.366
Hundreds of thousands of people are homeless

6
00:00:14.366 --> 00:00:15.566
Unattended

7
00:00:16.066 --> 00:00:17.400
If it is not secondary to the fishing line

8
00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.200
I'm afraid I'm still in the dark

9
00:00:19.466 --> 00:00:21.800
Your Highness, this is a big deal

10
00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.500
If it's not handled well

11
00:00:23.533 --> 00:00:25.133
Chin would rather boil

12
00:00:25.133 --> 00:00:26.833
The weight must be with you

13
00:00:26.866 --> 00:00:28.600
Your Highness is not good, Your Highness

14
00:00:29.166 --> 00:00:29.966
What's up

15
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.966
A large number of disaster victims gathered outside the palace gate

16
00:00:32.966 --> 00:00:34.633
They cordoned off the palace gates

17
00:00:34.666 --> 00:00:36.733
Uh, said to meet His Highness

18
00:00:36.733 --> 00:00:38.900
Uh, talking about this

19
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.566
Bad words

20
00:00:40.566 --> 00:00:43.300
What did they say about His Royal Highness the Prince?

21
00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:44.400
Chinese marriage collapse

22
00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.233
I want you to step down

23
00:00:47.266 --> 00:00:48.566
Open three rations immediately

24
00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:51.300
Set up 10 council weeks at the gate of the emperor

25
00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:51.866
Prince

26
00:00:51.866 --> 00:00:54.300
No one is allowed to starve to death in the territory

27
00:00:54.666 --> 00:00:55.700
Your Highness is wise

28
00:00:55.866 --> 00:00:58.833
By the way, let Yunxian come to see me

29
00:01:03.466 --> 00:01:04.800
Your Highness Kaizuo

30
00:01:04.866 --> 00:01:07.966
This flood has created the current situation

31
00:01:07.966 --> 00:01:10.933
Except for Zhao Hui and others who did not report it

32
00:01:10.933 --> 00:01:14.066
There is still a big problem to be solved

33
00:01:14.366 --> 00:01:15.866
If it is not solved properly

34
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.666
fear of popular uprising

35
00:01:17.733 --> 00:01:19.033
Forcing disaster victims

36
00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:21.033
Three are greater than the sky

37
00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:22.066
Wash your hands

38
00:01:22.566 --> 00:01:24.400
One is the lack of food in the city

39
00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.266
Those big grain merchants

40
00:01:26.333 --> 00:01:29.166
Let the grain rot in the warehouse

41
00:01:29.166 --> 00:01:30.900
I wouldn't sell it.

42
00:01:31.166 --> 00:01:33.233
Just to sell at a high price

43
00:01:34.466 --> 00:01:35.433
OK

44
00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.633
Let's see how hard the background is.

45
00:01:40.266 --> 00:01:42.566
Established Donggong House Industry

46
00:01:42.966 --> 00:01:45.966
Let these big Liangshan families in the city come to the banquet

47
00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:47.566
Yes
