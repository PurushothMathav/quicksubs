00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:02.066
You bastard

2
00:00:02.066 --> 00:00:04.200
How did you promise me before?

3
00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:05.733
Father, don't worry

4
00:00:05.733 --> 00:00:06.866
I don't care about this

5
00:00:06.866 --> 00:00:09.100
Whose fault is clear to you?

6
00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:12.500
Oh, His Royal Highness the Crown Prince is confused

7
00:00:12.733 --> 00:00:13.866
That being the case

8
00:00:13.866 --> 00:00:16.300
Don't blame the old minister for not missing the old love

9
00:00:17.366 --> 00:00:18.966
Your great summer was created by me

10
00:00:18.966 --> 00:00:22.266
I can destroy it too, you devil

11
00:00:22.266 --> 00:00:25.066
Confused, don't worry about the resurrection

12
00:00:25.533 --> 00:00:27.933
Lord G, don't be too proud

13
00:00:27.933 --> 00:00:29.033
Even if you rebel

14
00:00:29.166 --> 00:00:31.000
Do you think you have a winning hand?

15
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:31.933
perennial campaign

16
00:00:31.933 --> 00:00:33.466
Prestige in the army

17
00:00:33.466 --> 00:00:34.333
Huzheng arm

18
00:00:34.333 --> 00:00:35.466
More followers

19
00:00:35.466 --> 00:00:38.400
Not to mention the army stationed outside 50,000 city

20
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.533
It is no problem to crush the small imperial city

21
00:00:41.533 --> 00:00:43.833
Then you are dead wrong

22
00:00:43.866 --> 00:00:44.800
His Royal Highness

23
00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.600
Could it be that you have a plan to deal with it?

24
00:00:46.666 --> 00:00:48.966
Yan Xiang doesn't need to work so hard

25
00:00:48.966 --> 00:00:50.866
Then I'll tell you directly

26
00:00:50.866 --> 00:00:52.166
Have you heard of relics?

27
00:00:52.166 --> 00:00:54.866
This thing is called Trick-or-Treat Collapse.

28
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.366
Isn't that something that kids do?

29
00:00:58.366 --> 00:00:59.900
What are you doing with it?

30
00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:01.600
This trick is not that trick

31
00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:02.900
As long as there is this relic

32
00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.266
A mere 50,000 troops can average the mansion

33
00:01:05.266 --> 00:01:06.800
Hahahaha

34
00:01:06.866 --> 00:01:09.700
There is a limit to the prince's bragging

35
00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.133
Maybe you 50,000 army

36
00:01:12.133 --> 00:01:13.366
Have you ever seen it?

37
00:01:13.366 --> 00:01:15.866
How dare you speak wildly

38
00:01:15.866 --> 00:01:17.266
Why don't you believe it?

39
00:01:17.266 --> 00:01:19.266
I have been riding on the battlefield for many years

40
00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:21.333
Never heard of such a weapon

41
00:01:21.333 --> 00:01:22.633
Even if there is

42
00:01:22.666 --> 00:01:24.600
It has already been used by me

43
00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.300
Yeah, I guess you're right.

44
00:01:26.333 --> 00:01:28.366
With your pathetic knowledge

45
00:01:28.366 --> 00:01:30.266
I don't know, this stuff is normal

46
00:01:30.266 --> 00:01:31.066
you

47
00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:32.266
His Royal Highness

48
00:01:32.266 --> 00:01:34.833
You don't want to talk nonsense until you die

49
00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:38.000
Your Highness, if you apologize to the prince at this time

50
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Ask yourself to be abolished as prince

51
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.366
Maybe this will turn around

52
00:01:42.366 --> 00:01:45.000
Well, do you have one or two?

53
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.666
They all think they're winning

54
00:01:46.766 --> 00:01:47.900
Why don't you ask first

55
00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:50.066
Did I prepare in advance to deal with you?

56
00:01:50.266 --> 00:01:52.433
Aiko, what does this mean?
