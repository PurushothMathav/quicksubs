00:00:04.766 --> 00:00:08.233
What about the money for my underwear?

2
00:00:09.366 --> 00:00:13.666
The money for the underwear was all emptied by you prodigal

3
00:00:13.666 --> 00:00:16.366
I'm going to the Seven Cities Development Bureau

4
00:00:16.366 --> 00:00:18.200
For underprivileged students from all over the world

5
00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:19.933
I spent another three cities

6
00:00:19.933 --> 00:00:23.066
The tax service silver from all over the world is still on the way.

7
00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.866
The money for these panties is empty

8
00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:27.966
The father is beyond the emperor

9
00:00:27.966 --> 00:00:29.333
The son has his own plan

10
00:00:29.333 --> 00:00:30.133
Humph

11
00:00:30.666 --> 00:00:32.266
dignified emperor

12
00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:35.833
Because I have no money, I can't even take medicine

13
00:00:36.266 --> 00:00:39.333
You want to watch your father live without money to take medicine

14
00:00:39.333 --> 00:00:40.833
Death?

15
00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:42.966
And the throne of the palace

16
00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:44.300
Harem concubine

17
00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.300
The anger of the eunuch maids this month can't be sent out

18
00:00:48.466 --> 00:00:50.300
You told me not to worry

19
00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:51.866
Why don't you worry?

20
00:00:52.066 --> 00:00:54.100
Father Emperor is a mere silver tael

21
00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.466
The son can raise enough money in one day

22
00:00:56.466 --> 00:00:57.666
To settle this matter

23
00:00:57.666 --> 00:00:58.900
What are you saying?

24
00:00:59.166 --> 00:01:00.666
What tiger and wolf words

25
00:01:01.533 --> 00:01:04.366
30 million taels in one day

26
00:01:04.466 --> 00:01:08.533
The richest man in the world dare not boast of such a vast sea

27
00:01:08.533 --> 00:01:11.200
Father, you only need to bestow a pair of ink treasures

28
00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.933
Mo Bao only needs to write the words Huang En Haodang.

29
00:01:14.933 --> 00:01:17.066
If it is a sale

30
00:01:17.066 --> 00:01:18.600
Selling ink treasures

31
00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:20.200
Never promise

32
00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:21.233
Father rest assured

33
00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.366
In the end, this pair of ink treasures will definitely return to your hands

34
00:01:25.766 --> 00:01:28.333
Okay. What does that mean?

35
00:01:28.333 --> 00:01:29.866
Thank you father

36
00:01:33.933 --> 00:01:35.600
30 million taels in one day

37
00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.500
Just wait for the good news from my son
