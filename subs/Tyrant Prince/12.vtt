1
00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:03.566
Get out of here

2
00:00:08.566 --> 00:00:09.366
Lin Jia

3
00:00:10.333 --> 00:00:11.666
I can save you.

4
00:00:13.933 --> 00:00:16.466
Don't worry, there are locals here

5
00:00:17.266 --> 00:00:19.500
No one can leave alive

6
00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.766
What are you afraid of? I am the amazing stone field.

7
00:00:25.766 --> 00:00:27.633
I see who dares to mind my business

8
00:00:27.766 --> 00:00:30.100
Continue to kill the little white face

9
00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:31.633
A total of two dare to come

10
00:00:31.666 --> 00:00:34.366
This is from your wife, okay?

11
00:00:34.533 --> 00:00:35.933
Watch from the side

12
00:00:35.933 --> 00:00:37.966
What does the uncle care about your wife coming?

13
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.166
This is not the prince

14
00:00:40.366 --> 00:00:42.866
As for the people, the army of 10,000 is outside

15
00:00:43.533 --> 00:00:45.166
Already surrounded you

16
00:00:52.733 --> 00:00:54.666
At that time, my father was a hot summer

17
00:00:54.866 --> 00:00:56.833
He'll be here soon.

18
00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.666
Then I'll show him a good show

19
00:01:03.866 --> 00:01:04.900
Stay down

20
00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.500
Stay down and save me

21
00:01:08.933 --> 00:01:09.733
put

22
00:01:10.866 --> 00:01:11.666
put

23
00:01:12.533 --> 00:01:14.300
Let it go, don't let it go

24
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.000
I dare to kill him

25
00:01:17.066 --> 00:01:18.600
Do you dare not?

26
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.900
You think there's still something to save God

27
00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.066
Go away

28
00:01:23.533 --> 00:01:24.800
Underground work

29
00:01:24.866 --> 00:01:25.900
Disperse

30
00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.166
This is still the stupid boss of that cowardly rat

31
00:01:28.666 --> 00:01:30.566
There is such a violent killing side

32
00:01:30.966 --> 00:01:31.766
he

33
00:01:32.466 --> 00:01:35.200
He killed Yan Shifan in front of Yan Xiang

34
00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.000
What a show!

35
00:01:41.333 --> 00:01:43.366
I am the Amazing Messenger

36
00:01:43.533 --> 00:01:44.266
His Royal Highness

37
00:01:44.266 --> 00:01:47.500
Shouldn't the person who killed me give me an explanation?

38
00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.833
It's your turn if you kill me

39
00:01:50.866 --> 00:01:52.900
It's like completely turning against my soldier

40
00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.366
I rent 100,000 cavalry army under the county

41
00:01:55.366 --> 00:01:58.400
Lay all your so-called emperor and prince at your feet

42
00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.433
Take your mother's nutrition lightly

43
00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.566
All as angry as two lambs

44
00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:03.666
One three three four

45
00:02:04.133 --> 00:02:05.266
Not for me

46
00:02:05.333 --> 00:02:06.766
For military affairs

47
00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:11.966
Hurt me trend

48
00:02:12.066 --> 00:02:13.600
So teach me a lesson.

49
00:02:14.066 --> 00:02:15.633
They tell you

50
00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:16.766
Just this injury

51
00:02:17.133 --> 00:02:19.400
It's a price your hero can't afford

52
00:02:19.766 --> 00:02:22.266
You better get on your knees and kowtow and apologize

53
00:02:22.466 --> 00:02:23.833
I will bring two scriptures

54
00:02:24.166 --> 00:02:26.066
Spare you trash Han people

55
00:02:28.766 --> 00:02:30.600
What are you doing?
