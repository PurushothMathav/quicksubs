1
00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:01.200
Nonsense

2
00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:03.133
My carriage is made today

3
00:00:03.133 --> 00:00:04.700
How could it be shredded by red dust fragments?

4
00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:05.866
His Royal Highness

5
00:00:05.866 --> 00:00:06.900
You are bragging

6
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:09.200
It's better to have a limit.

7
00:00:09.966 --> 00:00:10.966
Report to Your Highness

8
00:00:10.966 --> 00:00:13.200
The minister just sent someone to investigate

9
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.166
Only these two pieces of iron were left in the whole carriage

10
00:00:16.166 --> 00:00:17.700
Please take a look

11
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:18.566
prince

12
00:00:18.766 --> 00:00:21.333
What is engraved on it is the logo of your Qin Ying Mansion

13
00:00:21.333 --> 00:00:22.266
Would you like to see it?

14
00:00:22.266 --> 00:00:23.066
prince

15
00:00:23.366 --> 00:00:26.600
This iron flake looks a little familiar.

16
00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.400
Isn't this fragment a sign of my house?

17
00:00:31.866 --> 00:00:33.000
Absolutely not.

18
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.800
This missile is so powerful

19
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.266
If the emperor doesn't believe it

20
00:00:40.266 --> 00:00:41.233
You can ask Yu Qian.

21
00:00:41.333 --> 00:00:42.333
Report to your majesty

22
00:00:42.333 --> 00:00:43.300
His Royal Highness

23
00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:45.866
The missile we're following is powerful

24
00:00:45.866 --> 00:00:48.200
Not only did he blow Lord Qin's carriage to pieces

25
00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.400
Palaces a few kilometers around were also burned down

26
00:00:51.466 --> 00:00:52.966
It's just trying to think

27
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:54.866
If you add a little more flame

28
00:00:54.866 --> 00:00:56.700
The entire palace can be blown to pieces

29
00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:58.966
Such a terrifying weapon

30
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.100
Impossible absolutely impossible

31
00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:01.900
Wang Yi

32
00:01:02.466 --> 00:01:04.600
You can also see the power of this missile

33
00:01:04.766 --> 00:01:07.066
Do you dare to oppose it?

34
00:01:07.066 --> 00:01:08.100
Sinners dare not

35
00:01:08.266 --> 00:01:10.566
Then I, the immoral and incompetent prince

36
00:01:10.666 --> 00:01:12.233
Do I still want to apologize to you?
