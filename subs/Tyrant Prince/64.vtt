1
00:00:00.566 --> 00:00:01.666
Your Highness cannot

2
00:00:01.766 --> 00:00:05.000
Aguda deliberately dresses arrogantly

3
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.166
Just to trick you into entering the game

4
00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:10.300
Aguda is the first master of the army

5
00:00:10.366 --> 00:00:11.866
3-Year-old can memorize poetry

6
00:00:11.866 --> 00:00:13.733
5-Year-old proficient in arithmetic

7
00:00:13.733 --> 00:00:17.800
At the age of 15, he made plans to fight with the King of Gold

8
00:00:18.066 --> 00:00:18.866
It doesn't matter

9
00:00:19.166 --> 00:00:20.666
I am also a Chema in Daxia

10
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:22.266
Also for honesty at the border

11
00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:23.200
Worth a bet

12
00:00:23.266 --> 00:00:26.833
This fool prince actually dares to fight with Daijin Guoshi

13
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.800
Sure enough, Aguda was right

14
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.000
youthful

15
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:30.900
Seat posture

16
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.166
Any hit and it's hooked immediately

17
00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:34.333
Wait until he loses

18
00:00:34.333 --> 00:00:36.666
It will be in the anger of the people all over the country

19
00:00:36.766 --> 00:00:38.366
Rolled down in disgrace

20
00:00:38.366 --> 00:00:39.966
Okay, that's the first question

21
00:00:40.266 --> 00:00:42.666
Will the prince go first or will I come first?

22
00:00:42.866 --> 00:00:44.600
Why not let you go first?

23
00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:47.366
Stupid, it's not easy to recalculate

24
00:00:47.566 --> 00:00:49.166
Sure enough, God Bless Dajin

25
00:00:49.166 --> 00:00:52.500
Arrange a pig-like person to be the hero prince

26
00:00:58.666 --> 00:01:00.500
This thing is my gold

27
00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.866
and

28
00:01:00.866 --> 00:01:04.000
Ten Thousand Wise Men Euclidean Mechanics Made in Decades

29
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.566
No Unlock

30
00:01:05.566 --> 00:01:07.966
If His Royal Highness the Crown Prince can unlock it within one day

31
00:01:07.966 --> 00:01:09.166
Even if you win

32
00:01:09.533 --> 00:01:13.366
A study stopped a decade ago

33
00:01:13.366 --> 00:01:16.533
He actually asked His Highness the Crown Prince to untie it for a day

34
00:01:16.533 --> 00:01:18.633
Isn't that difficult?

35
00:01:18.666 --> 00:01:20.866
I'm afraid you can't solve it yourself

36
00:01:20.866 --> 00:01:22.300
I really can't solve it

37
00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:23.433
So what?

38
00:01:23.466 --> 00:01:26.066
I don't need to solve the intellectual battle myself

39
00:01:26.066 --> 00:01:29.033
This is what your Crown Prince promised himself

40
00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.000
It's just a simple Luban lock.

41
00:01:32.466 --> 00:01:34.100
It's a pity, Aguda

42
00:01:34.533 --> 00:01:37.000
I stand on the shoulders of the ancients and history

43
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.500
Hanging you is like playing with you

44
00:01:38.566 --> 00:01:41.266
Why do you need to be one when you untie him with this thing?
