00:00:04.533 --> 00:00:06.000
Your Highness is indeed amazing

2
00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:09.300
But just by virtue of these people here

3
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.300
I'm afraid they won't sell much. Don't worry.

4
00:00:11.333 --> 00:00:12.433
free method

5
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:19.300
Come come come

6
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.866
In order to thank everyone for their enthusiasm

7
00:00:22.866 --> 00:00:25.366
We specially launched a friend to help fight

8
00:00:25.366 --> 00:00:26.566
Hee hee gameplay

9
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:30.133
As long as you can get a friend

10
00:00:30.133 --> 00:00:31.366
Come here to buy lottery tickets

11
00:00:31.366 --> 00:00:32.700
Every time someone is pulled in

12
00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.033
You can have a chance to throw a throwing knife

13
00:00:35.066 --> 00:00:37.433
As long as the throwing knife is dropped on this turntable

14
00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:39.133
You can redeem the prize.

15
00:00:39.133 --> 00:00:41.266
Like a half-price lottery ticket.

16
00:00:41.266 --> 00:00:43.266
Gold 10 both are OK.

17
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:44.733
There is such a good thing

18
00:00:44.733 --> 00:00:46.066
You hurry up and let the members buy it

19
00:00:46.066 --> 00:00:47.100
That's a big deal.

20
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.300
I'll hand it over quickly.

21
00:00:50.933 --> 00:00:53.900
Your Highness, you really have a way

22
00:00:53.933 --> 00:00:55.633
I did it! I did it!

23
00:00:55.766 --> 00:00:57.000
Very dangerous very dangerous

24
00:00:57.266 --> 00:01:01.433
One or two silver won, hahahahahaha

25
00:01:05.133 --> 00:01:06.100
Coming, coming.

26
00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:08.066
Come come

27
00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:15.966
Give me 50 sheets.

28
00:01:28.666 --> 00:01:30.400
Why is this all thanks for the review?

29
00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.000
No, I've already spent 50 taels.

30
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.366
30 more

31
00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.666
Well, yes, as long as there is a consolation prize, it will not be a loss.
