00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:01.366
That's a good point.

2
00:00:03.666 --> 00:00:04.900
The clouds are back

3
00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.766
I'm back, where's Xinxin?

4
00:00:08.766 --> 00:00:10.766
I helped Aunt Wang with the discharge procedures

5
00:00:11.166 --> 00:00:13.166
Sent her back with Xinxin

6
00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:15.300
Back

7
00:00:16.166 --> 00:00:19.466
Hey, why did mom and grandpa stand up?

8
00:00:19.566 --> 00:00:21.900
It's such a strange will to pass on men and not women.

9
00:00:22.966 --> 00:00:24.466
I find it strange too.

10
00:00:24.466 --> 00:00:26.000
Available in black and white

11
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.666
Another lawyer testifies

12
00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:29.433
I really can't help it.

13
00:00:29.966 --> 00:00:33.066
Then can I see grandpa's will?

14
00:00:34.966 --> 00:00:36.833
Good master, I'll get it for you.

15
00:00:48.766 --> 00:00:52.766
This character doesn't look like it was written by my grandfather, Mom.

16
00:00:52.866 --> 00:00:53.900
Grandpa's will

17
00:00:54.066 --> 00:00:56.433
Lose money and save it for me.

18
00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.600
Look at the pen and ink of this old man

19
00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.266
It's always been in your hand, take it

20
00:01:12.366 --> 00:01:13.233
You say

21
00:01:13.766 --> 00:01:15.833
Is the information heartbreaking?

22
00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.766
Will never recognize me as a mother

23
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.100
Madam is a filial child

24
00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:22.200
We say we don't understand.

25
00:01:22.566 --> 00:01:24.800
But someone can

26
00:01:25.566 --> 00:01:26.700
You mean?

27
00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:28.466
Fog Magnolia

28
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.666
Ah hello hey wait

29
00:01:34.666 --> 00:01:35.700
There's not much to say.

30
00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:36.966
I have something to say

31
00:01:37.766 --> 00:01:40.266
Don't you want to hear about the future of the stars?

32
00:02:03.766 --> 00:02:04.633
Ms. Wu

33
00:02:05.366 --> 00:02:06.600
I came today.

34
00:02:06.733 --> 00:02:10.066
To repent for the wrong I did

35
00:02:10.466 --> 00:02:12.566
Confidence He is my daughter

36
00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:14.666
On his arm

37
00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.466
Is there a star scar?

38
00:02:17.466 --> 00:02:18.900
That's what I left behind

39
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.533
For our future

40
00:02:20.533 --> 00:02:21.500
Love forever
