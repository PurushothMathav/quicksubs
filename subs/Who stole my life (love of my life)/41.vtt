00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:02.666
You just said that you can return it within 7 days, right?

2
00:00:02.966 --> 00:00:04.366
I would like to return it.

3
00:00:04.566 --> 00:00:07.400
No problem, please come here.

4
00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:09.200
What please?

5
00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.600
Return the goods as soon as the front foot steps down the back foot.

6
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:13.100
I see if you are here to make trouble.

7
00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:16.600
You are the one who told me that you can return it.

8
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.966
So that's your idea?

9
00:00:18.966 --> 00:00:21.166
The wind has to buy you clothes one after another

10
00:00:21.166 --> 00:00:23.866
The clothes will be returned and exchanged for money, right?

11
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.166
I don't talk to you with respect

12
00:00:27.766 --> 00:00:29.566
You dare to do it, don't you?

13
00:00:29.566 --> 00:00:30.400
I'll tell you what.

14
00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.000
What I look down on the most is you

15
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.733
Being a bitch still wants to build an archway

16
00:00:33.733 --> 00:00:34.766
Gold Worker

17
00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:36.666
Let me tell you something.

18
00:00:36.666 --> 00:00:39.533
Our store is one of the largest luxury brands in the world.

19
00:00:39.533 --> 00:00:40.900
If you mess up again

20
00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:44.166
I'm going to warn you about a play-hunting pose

21
00:00:51.933 --> 00:00:55.300
Hey, Ma Yunzhou, have you seen Xinxin?

22
00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.033
He is neither at home nor at school

23
00:00:57.333 --> 00:00:58.500
We just broke up

24
00:00:58.800 --> 00:00:59.800
He shouldn't have gone far

25
00:01:03.933 --> 00:01:06.166
Luxury stores can slander customers

26
00:01:06.266 --> 00:01:08.200
Where is your manager? I want to complain.

27
00:01:08.466 --> 00:01:11.100
Okay, you can complain.

28
00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:12.900
What's up?

29
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.200
How come?

30
00:01:15.566 --> 00:01:16.600
Who wants to complain?
