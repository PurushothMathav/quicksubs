00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:01.566
Manager, this crazy woman

2
00:00:01.566 --> 00:00:02.366
Talk nonsense

3
00:00:02.366 --> 00:00:03.733
The quality of the clothes in our store is wrong.

4
00:00:03.733 --> 00:00:05.300
Want to return it?

5
00:00:05.733 --> 00:00:06.866
What's the matter with me?

6
00:00:09.266 --> 00:00:09.800
manager

7
00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:12.500
Isn't your store a return and exchange within 7 days without reason?

8
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:13.933
I haven't touched this dress.

9
00:00:13.933 --> 00:00:14.733
Return it.

10
00:00:15.333 --> 00:00:17.733
You may not know this guest yet, right?

11
00:00:17.733 --> 00:00:21.366
Our store only has VIP customers who spend over 1 million yuan

12
00:00:21.366 --> 00:00:22.466
Return and exchange only.

13
00:00:22.466 --> 00:00:23.900
Who are you?

14
00:00:26.066 --> 00:00:28.300
Then your clerk slandered me as a gold digger.

15
00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:29.766
Can I complain to him?

16
00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:33.900
Excuse me, did you buy these clothes with your own money?

17
00:00:33.933 --> 00:00:37.100
It's not for you to buy it and return it immediately.

18
00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.100
What's wrong with saying you're a gold digger?

19
00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:41.266
Argumentative

20
00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:42.866
If you don't give a refund, you won't give a refund.

21
00:00:42.866 --> 00:00:44.166
Why should you maliciously speculate about me?

22
00:00:44.166 --> 00:00:47.533
Yo, I'm guilty of being in and out of pain points.

23
00:00:47.533 --> 00:00:49.900
Haha, we are arguing

24
00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:51.500
Or are you messing around?

25
00:00:51.566 --> 00:00:52.700
I'll tell you what.

26
00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.466
Get out today

27
00:00:54.466 --> 00:00:56.366
If you don't get out, blame me for being rude

28
00:00:57.266 --> 00:01:00.266
I recorded everything you just said

29
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.433
I'm going to post it online for everyone to comment on.

30
00:01:02.533 --> 00:01:04.400
In the end, it's you who look down on people

31
00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.366
Or should I go back and do something to block the road?

32
00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:09.800
Let go let go

33
00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.200
Give it back to me

34
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.533
I think you are the programmer who made trouble today.

35
00:01:14.533 --> 00:01:15.366
I'll tell you what.

36
00:01:15.366 --> 00:01:17.033
You're not going to walk out that door today.
