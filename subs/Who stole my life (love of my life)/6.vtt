1
00:00:00.533 --> 00:00:01.333
I didn't steal it.

2
00:00:01.333 --> 00:00:02.600
This is my bracelet.

3
00:00:02.933 --> 00:00:06.166
You didn't steal it, is Miss Xiao still falsely accusing you?

4
00:00:06.166 --> 00:00:07.300
Some people.

5
00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:08.500
Vanity

6
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:10.266
Steal if you can't afford it

7
00:00:10.333 --> 00:00:11.933
He also arrested a county magistrate and dared not admit it

8
00:00:11.933 --> 00:00:12.900
I didn't steal it.

9
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.433
This is my bracelet.

10
00:00:14.466 --> 00:00:16.966
I've been wearing it for over ten years

11
00:00:18.566 --> 00:00:21.000
There is only one bracelet in the world.

12
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.066
Do you hear me?

13
00:00:22.066 --> 00:00:24.800
How could your mother, a stinky vegetable seller, possibly afford it?

14
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.800
Take it off and give it to me

15
00:00:26.966 --> 00:00:30.166
Give me release put me on top

16
00:00:32.333 --> 00:00:33.700
How dare you fight back

17
00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:34.766
Hold him down for me

18
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:38.400
Our college was closed for the first week

19
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.200
It's Lin Xiaoxiao, don't mind your own business if anything happens to me.

20
00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:42.333
Lin Xiaoxiao has just been brilliant

21
00:00:42.333 --> 00:00:43.566
Not only the head of the Lu family

22
00:00:43.566 --> 00:00:45.066
Or the honorary director of our school

23
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.600
But this time it will be pinched

24
00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:50.100
Uh-huh.

25
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.800
Let go let go ah ah ah

26
00:01:00.266 --> 00:01:01.700
Why don't you run away

27
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.066
Keep running, will you spare me?

28
00:01:07.533 --> 00:01:10.366
The little lady found it in his bag.

29
00:01:14.933 --> 00:01:15.733
Yo

30
00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.066
New dancing shoes

31
00:01:18.333 --> 00:01:20.300
It was drawn by a child.

32
00:01:20.366 --> 00:01:21.400
You didn't steal it, did you?

33
00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:22.800
Ah, give it back to me

34
00:01:22.933 --> 00:01:23.700
You give it back to me

35
00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:24.400
You give it back to me

36
00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.200
This is all my mom's birthday gifts, you give it back to me

37
00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.166
Can't get up if you don't wish

38
00:01:30.166 --> 00:01:31.933
You let go. You let go.

39
00:01:31.933 --> 00:01:36.666
I can't enter, you give up on you, you believe me, I will

40
00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.600
Let go of you

41
00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.966
Where did Shaolin come from?
