00:00:10.166 --> 00:00:11.533
Doctor, how is my mother?

2
00:00:11.533 --> 00:00:12.966
Your mother is an old mathematician

3
00:00:12.966 --> 00:00:14.700
It has been temporarily rescued.

4
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:15.533
That would be fine.

5
00:00:15.533 --> 00:00:18.200
120,000 the cost of the surgery and hospital stay

6
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.200
12.

7
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.700
Doctor, I will definitely find a way to get the money.

8
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:26.066
You must save my mother

9
00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:34.766
Our college's triennial dance competition

10
00:00:34.766 --> 00:00:35.600
About to start

11
00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.500
Students are welcome to sign up

12
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.833
Mr. Guo, why did you come here in person?

13
00:00:44.133 --> 00:00:45.966
I'm here to accompany Xiaoxiao to sign up

14
00:00:45.966 --> 00:00:48.233
By the way, let's see the situation of my sister-in-law

15
00:00:48.733 --> 00:00:50.066
Thanks to four sponsorships

16
00:00:50.066 --> 00:00:52.766
We can only upgrade this competition to a national competition

17
00:00:52.766 --> 00:00:53.400
Sister Xiaoxiao

18
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.366
I heard that this dance competition was sponsored by your godmother

19
00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.400
First place gets 200,000 bonus

20
00:00:58.466 --> 00:01:00.700
You can also sign a contract with Lu's Mingxia company

21
00:01:00.866 --> 00:01:04.400
Of course, I won the championship.

22
00:01:04.566 --> 00:01:06.900
I also hope to pass this competition

23
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.700
Is it true that Mr. Zhang's first prize is 200,000?

24
00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:11.700
Yes.

25
00:01:13.133 --> 00:01:14.600
You enter the competition

26
00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:16.866
Just for the money

27
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.466
Wood star competition

28
00:01:19.666 --> 00:01:21.266
How can I get first place?

29
00:01:23.766 --> 00:01:26.966
Mu Xinxin, you usually forget about losing money

30
00:01:26.966 --> 00:01:28.166
This competition

31
00:01:28.466 --> 00:01:30.766
But my godmother likes it to encourage young dancers

32
00:01:30.766 --> 00:01:31.300
help

33
00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:34.033
For someone like you with a mouth full of money, would you guess?

34
00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.166
Teacher Zhang

35
00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.200
I am the sponsor of the competition

36
00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.566
And the identity of the college's honorary campus

37
00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.600
This kind of play is not allowed in the competition

38
00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.033
Yes, yes!

39
00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.900
Why are people like you who only care about money not qualified?

40
00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.900
Why are you not qualified to take the first place with your strength?

41
00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:58.700
My mom is a sponsor

42
00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.600
If you say you won't be allowed to participate, you won't be allowed to participate

43
00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.600
Are you so afraid that I will steal Ling Xiaoxiao's limelight?

44
00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:08.833
I'd like to see it

45
00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.233
How did you get this first?
