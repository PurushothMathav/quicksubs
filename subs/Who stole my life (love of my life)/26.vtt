00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.366
Yunzhong, you came to question me for an outsider

2
00:00:03.366 --> 00:00:05.466
You really disappoint me.

3
00:00:05.466 --> 00:00:07.666
The one who let me down is you

4
00:00:08.166 --> 00:00:11.800
You told me to live in justice and fairness

5
00:00:11.866 --> 00:00:14.100
In the clouds, you understand again

6
00:00:14.166 --> 00:00:15.566
Xiao Xiao is not an outsider

7
00:00:15.566 --> 00:00:17.266
He is your future wife

8
00:00:17.566 --> 00:00:19.500
Xiao Xiao Lin Xiao Xiao Dad

9
00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:21.200
I sometimes really doubt

10
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:22.333
I am your own

11
00:00:22.333 --> 00:00:23.866
Or is he your own?

12
00:00:26.766 --> 00:00:27.566
Yes

13
00:00:28.066 --> 00:00:29.733
Xiao Xiao is my biological daughter

14
00:00:29.733 --> 00:00:30.966
You are the one I adopted

15
00:00:30.966 --> 00:00:32.166
Are you satisfied?

16
00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.066
This is you

17
00:00:35.566 --> 00:00:37.566
The reason why I was named Xiao Xiao

18
00:00:40.366 --> 00:00:43.233
I dream of my daughter.

19
00:00:43.466 --> 00:00:45.766
Can you call me mom openly?

20
00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:47.500
So this is it

21
00:00:48.133 --> 00:00:49.200
original

22
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.266
I'm not your son at all

23
00:01:05.966 --> 00:01:06.300
Hey

24
00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:09.866
Uncle Jiang, the young master and the wife are going crazy if they can't find you

25
00:01:09.866 --> 00:01:11.933
I'm fine, don't worry.

26
00:01:11.933 --> 00:01:12.766
Uncle Jiang

27
00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:15.533
Young Master, I was the one who carried you from the orphanage

28
00:01:15.533 --> 00:01:16.933
If you want to blame, blame me.

29
00:01:16.933 --> 00:01:18.933
But in the past 18 years, I have seen

30
00:01:18.933 --> 00:01:21.066
The rich treat you like their own son

31
00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:22.633
I see.

32
00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.400
Uncle Jiang, I know my mother is good to me

33
00:01:26.733 --> 00:01:30.166
I just couldn't take it for a while

34
00:01:30.166 --> 00:01:31.533
I understand how you feel.

35
00:01:31.533 --> 00:01:34.500
But now Lu Jiaming sees Dandan as wanting to fight for the family property

36
00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.066
We have to look at the bigger picture.

37
00:01:36.133 --> 00:01:37.100
This time

38
00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.500
Madam, he needs you, don't worry

39
00:01:39.966 --> 00:01:40.900
Uncle Jiang

40
00:01:42.066 --> 00:01:43.633
I will protect my mother

41
00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.300
On his arm

42
00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.600
How can there be this scar?

43
00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:05.000
Is he

44
00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:08.833
Miss, you are looking for me.

45
00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:11.700
These two hairs

46
00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:13.866
You do a paternity test

47
00:02:14.766 --> 00:02:17.366
Remember, don't let anyone know.

48
00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.100
OK

49
00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:36.700
Why are you here?

50
00:02:37.366 --> 00:02:38.566
Name a price.

51
00:02:38.933 --> 00:02:40.433
How much? Shut up

52
00:02:40.766 --> 00:02:41.866
Your World

53
00:02:41.866 --> 00:02:44.900
Is it the one who came forward to divide the three six nine?

54
00:02:44.933 --> 00:02:45.966
So sad

55
00:02:46.866 --> 00:02:48.233
But what actually

56
00:02:48.766 --> 00:02:51.066
You have nothing at all
