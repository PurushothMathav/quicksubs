00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.233
You're supposed to be celebrating a man's birthday, right?

2
00:00:03.866 --> 00:00:06.633
What's the room number again?

3
00:00:06.766 --> 00:00:10.000
That was the birthday of one of my best friends' brothers.

4
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.700
I went to celebrate his birthday

5
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.233
Well, I can't remember the number of rooms.

6
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.266
Celebrate a man's birthday

7
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:23.000
It belongs to me, but I will be jealous.

8
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.933
Oh, how could I?

9
00:00:24.933 --> 00:00:27.133
Will you celebrate a boy's birthday alone?

10
00:00:27.133 --> 00:00:28.766
I have many friends.

11
00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:30.033
Really?

12
00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:34.000
Well, then you can go back and rest early.

13
00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.800
Auntie will take you to the hospital for examination tomorrow

14
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.433
Tomorrow is so sudden

15
00:00:40.366 --> 00:00:43.466
Ah, my mom just took me to check it out last week

16
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.933
The month is still small, so you don't need to go often.

17
00:00:45.933 --> 00:00:47.766
Please help me tell my aunt.

18
00:00:54.066 --> 00:00:56.633
Okay, then I'll trouble my aunt tomorrow.

19
00:01:00.066 --> 00:01:01.133
What should I do?

20
00:01:01.133 --> 00:01:02.600
The child's more wrong

21
00:01:03.133 --> 00:01:05.866
If the Lus find out, we'll both be finished

22
00:01:06.466 --> 00:01:07.966
Don't worry, you can go in peace.

23
00:01:07.966 --> 00:01:09.766
Sister Shen, I will arrange it.

24
00:01:15.133 --> 00:01:16.000
Miss

25
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.166
Brother-in-law, you have something to accompany me to pick it up today.

26
00:01:19.366 --> 00:01:20.800
Then please.
