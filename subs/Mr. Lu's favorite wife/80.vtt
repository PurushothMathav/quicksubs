00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:01.833
Four Seasons Hotel that night

2
00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:04.700
Is the woman in my bed you?

3
00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:09.666
Qinghai, do you believe me that it was me that night?

4
00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:13.966
Do you think I would believe you?

5
00:00:16.466 --> 00:00:19.166
Ah, I really didn't lie to you.

6
00:00:19.166 --> 00:00:20.700
This child is sweet

7
00:00:21.533 --> 00:00:23.666
Warm he is jealous that I am with you

8
00:00:23.666 --> 00:00:25.433
Then find someone to insult me

9
00:00:25.766 --> 00:00:27.166
I'm too scared to tell you.

10
00:00:27.166 --> 00:00:29.166
I'm just afraid that you will dislike me

11
00:00:29.533 --> 00:00:31.300
Be with warmth

12
00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.266
Just swallow me in my hands

13
00:00:34.266 --> 00:00:36.366
Warm is never possible

14
00:00:36.366 --> 00:00:37.666
Tell the truth

15
00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.833
You know it all

16
00:00:43.466 --> 00:00:44.266
Xixi

17
00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:45.933
Don't blame mom

18
00:00:45.933 --> 00:00:47.866
Mom is sorry for you

19
00:00:48.533 --> 00:00:49.800
You do

20
00:00:50.666 --> 00:00:52.433
Not my own daughter

21
00:00:53.666 --> 00:00:55.566
Is my beautiful heart confused?

22
00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:56.766
that year

23
00:00:57.133 --> 00:01:00.400
I watched Mengard stay by Ouhe's side

24
00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.600
He took meticulous care of Ouhe

25
00:01:04.066 --> 00:01:06.866
Watching Ou He enter the high castle to give birth

26
00:01:06.966 --> 00:01:08.500
I am jealous

27
00:01:08.733 --> 00:01:09.800
I feel bad.

28
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.866
So I So you interchange me and wood terms

29
00:01:13.133 --> 00:01:15.466
How can my head belong to my life?

30
00:01:16.933 --> 00:01:19.066
Xixi, don't blame your mother.

31
00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:21.166
Don't blame me.

32
00:01:21.266 --> 00:01:22.233
My fault.

33
00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.033
It has nothing to do with the leaves.

34
00:01:25.766 --> 00:01:28.566
You're still only thinking about wood terms

35
00:01:28.866 --> 00:01:31.400
When I was growing up, I was bullied by wooden terms

36
00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:32.933
You never ask right or wrong

37
00:01:32.933 --> 00:01:34.833
Forced me to apologize to him

38
00:01:35.566 --> 00:01:37.266
No matter what he does to you

39
00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.766
You will try your best to make delicious food

40
00:01:40.766 --> 00:01:42.633
Leave the fun to him

41
00:01:43.333 --> 00:01:45.400
I'll ask you today

42
00:01:47.733 --> 00:01:50.400
Have you ever regarded me as your daughter?

43
00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:51.300

You have nothing to do with me anymore

51
00:02:12.566 --> 00:02:13.600

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.900
