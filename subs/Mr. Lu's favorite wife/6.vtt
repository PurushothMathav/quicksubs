00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:01.233
Right?

2
00:00:01.766 --> 00:00:03.500
I made you kneel and apologize

3
00:00:03.933 --> 00:00:07.466
Enough, why is Miss Mu so aggressive?

4
00:00:08.566 --> 00:00:12.600
You may not know that this mediocre man has always been restless

5
00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:16.100
When you have all the money, you want to cling to it

6
00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.000
If my parents weren't kind-hearted

7
00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.166
They were already kicked out.

8
00:00:22.566 --> 00:00:25.400
Miss Lu is also worried about you

9
00:00:25.733 --> 00:00:27.833
You are in a hurry, you are out of proportion.

10
00:00:29.533 --> 00:00:32.266
You, a servant, can't even do this well

11
00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.366
It's really not suitable to stay at home

12
00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:36.100
warm

13
00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.566
You go and pack up your three-month salary

14
00:00:39.566 --> 00:00:40.700
Leave their house

15
00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:43.133
So beautiful, I know it's my fault.

16
00:00:43.133 --> 00:00:45.166
Please don't let me leave the Mu family

17
00:00:46.933 --> 00:00:49.333
No, if you lose your job

18
00:00:49.333 --> 00:00:50.566
Mom's illness

19
00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:53.500
Mrs. Wu is too warm and famous

20
00:00:54.866 --> 00:00:55.566
Our wood family

21
00:00:55.566 --> 00:00:57.566
I don't even have the right to open any servants

22
00:00:58.133 --> 00:00:59.366
Anyway.

23
00:00:59.666 --> 00:01:01.433
It's all his fault.

24
00:01:02.266 --> 00:01:04.466
It's evidence that he asked the host and guests to invite

25
00:01:06.133 --> 00:01:07.066
Such a maid

26
00:01:07.866 --> 00:01:09.400
I dare not ask for cultural relics engraving.

27
00:01:10.166 --> 00:01:12.966
Madam, madam, you have energy.

28
00:01:12.966 --> 00:01:15.500
I really can't live without this job placenta

29
00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:18.666
That's enough!
