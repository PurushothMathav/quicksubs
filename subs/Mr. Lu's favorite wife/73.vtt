00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.566
Here, give me. Give me one.

2
00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:06.600
Come, this is your warmth.

3
00:00:07.966 --> 00:00:10.566
I don't want to play these games of yours

4
00:00:10.666 --> 00:00:13.433
Oh, let's play, let's have fun together

5
00:00:13.466 --> 00:00:15.266
We can't continue if you don't play

6
00:00:15.266 --> 00:00:16.866
Just for fun

7
00:00:19.166 --> 00:00:21.300
Yo you are hearts

8
00:00:21.466 --> 00:00:23.066
Good luck

9
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.300
What happened to the hearts?

10
00:00:25.966 --> 00:00:27.900
Ah our game

11
00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:29.933
There are 40 cards in the deck.

12
00:00:29.933 --> 00:00:33.400
There are two brown sugar in it. Did you get brown sugar?

13
00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:34.866
I owe two minutes

14
00:00:35.466 --> 00:00:37.266
I don't know your rules

15
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.000
I don't want to play well.

16
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.266
You don't want to go back on it, do you?

17
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:43.833
Drink it up.

18
00:00:44.733 --> 00:00:46.066
All of us here

19
00:00:46.066 --> 00:00:48.266
Which one is not rich and powerful?

20
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.200
You're a little maid, and you picked it up

21
00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.366
Yes, warm.

22
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:53.766
You won't suffer.

23
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.333
Open the card, come and open the door to open the money

24
00:00:56.333 --> 00:00:57.666
Let me see it.

25
00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.000
Who is so unlucky to ask the maid a question?

26
00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.200
Hey Ding Shao

27
00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:03.966
Can't it be you?

28
00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:07.300
I would love to.

29
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.200
But God doesn't give me this luck

30
00:01:11.566 --> 00:01:13.933
Hey, who else hasn't opened it?

31
00:01:13.933 --> 00:01:16.033
What about my brother?
