00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:01.133
Come come good

2
00:00:01.133 --> 00:00:03.366
We only have one heart left now.

3
00:00:03.366 --> 00:00:04.800
Who drew this heart?

4
00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:07.433
Just choose the truth or drink

5
00:00:07.566 --> 00:00:08.500
Drink three glasses in a row

6
00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:10.366
Come to warm, you smoke first

7
00:00:14.466 --> 00:00:16.866
Ah, warm, you are hearts.

8
00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:19.233
I drink.

9
00:00:36.666 --> 00:00:38.133
I drink for him

10
00:00:38.133 --> 00:00:39.366
That won't work.

11
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.200
If you lose, you lose.

12
00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.366
If you can't afford it, you can choose the truth

13
00:00:43.366 --> 00:00:45.200
Come to Sisi, you ask

14
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.500
Warm, I heard you had an abortion.

15
00:00:48.933 --> 00:00:50.166
Is that right?

16
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.200
Mmmm tofu

17
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.166
Whose child is it?

18
00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:01.300
no.

19
00:01:02.533 --> 00:01:04.100
I don't know.

20
00:01:04.366 --> 00:01:06.566
Are there too many men who have slept?

21
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.366
Even the father of the child doesn't know who it belongs to

22
00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:10.900
Shameless

23
00:01:11.766 --> 00:01:13.966
It's your previous senior

24
00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:19.166
Teacher, it's a pity for this little life

25
00:01:19.166 --> 00:01:21.266
You are too heartless
