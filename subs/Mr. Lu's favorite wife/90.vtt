00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:12.900
What's up?

2
00:00:14.533 --> 00:00:16.000
What are you doing?

3
00:00:16.366 --> 00:00:18.866
I just want to know if this is a secret

4
00:00:18.866 --> 00:00:22.433
No? I do. I love you

5
00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.566
Wu Qinghai, do you know?

6
00:00:27.866 --> 00:00:29.666
When we first met

7
00:00:29.666 --> 00:00:33.100
I'm thinking of you as an excellent man

8
00:00:33.366 --> 00:00:34.900
I guess I won't look at me more

9
00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.633
Maybe we won't miss you at all

10
00:00:39.866 --> 00:00:41.433
We still met

11
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.366
I have been through so much with you

12
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:49.033
Warm, do you remember the first time we met?

13
00:00:49.733 --> 00:00:50.666
The thing is now

14
00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.066
You almost burned me with a cup of tea

15
00:00:54.066 --> 00:00:55.466
I still thought

16
00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:56.900
You maid

17
00:00:57.333 --> 00:00:58.700
How clumsy

18
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:00.800
But it seems familiar

19
00:01:01.733 --> 00:01:04.666
I know I'm saying this as if I were hitting on a conversation

20
00:01:05.766 --> 00:01:08.600
But I don't think it's the first time we've met.

21
00:01:08.933 --> 00:01:10.233
Maybe a past life

22
00:01:10.533 --> 00:01:12.566
You may have been my wife in a previous life

23
00:01:14.066 --> 00:01:15.000
Mr. Wu

24
00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.766
If I lied to you

25
00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.566
Will you be angry no

26
00:01:21.866 --> 00:01:22.666
pity

27
00:01:23.133 --> 00:01:24.366
I won't be angry with you.

28
00:01:26.133 --> 00:01:27.966
In fact, the first time we met

29
00:01:28.333 --> 00:01:29.900
At the Four Seasons Hotel

30
00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:31.833
You were drugged that night

31
00:01:32.333 --> 00:01:34.266
It's not a wooden bed with you

32
00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.033
It was me.
