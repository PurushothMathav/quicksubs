00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:02.966
She said she was the richest girl.

2
00:00:02.966 --> 00:00:05.233
So why didn't Letzhu personally come to pick you up?

3
00:00:05.333 --> 00:00:07.000
If possible, provide evidence.

4
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.366
Prove your identity

5
00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:12.300
That's right, this Leitzhu is a relative of the eldest lady.

6
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.366
Eldest Miss wants to come, he will definitely come personally to pick her up.

7
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:16.833
Right?

8
00:00:17.566 --> 00:00:19.000
I originally paid in advance.

9
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.400
What evidence do I need to prove myself?

10
00:00:21.766 --> 00:00:23.166
Are you still talking about me?

11
00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.500
Didn't you also say you were a down payment?

12
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.433
So what evidence do you have to prove that you are?

13
00:00:29.133 --> 00:00:29.933
Of course.

14
00:00:30.166 --> 00:00:32.533
The top floor of Long Xuyen hotel is where the deposit is placed.

15
00:00:32.533 --> 00:00:34.300
The theme leads to the top floor

16
00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.533
There is only the supreme and unique black card of the young lady.

17
00:00:36.533 --> 00:00:37.400
You can use the card

18
00:00:37.533 --> 00:00:41.100
So the person who owns the card pays in advance.

19
00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.800
Do you dare go upstairs with me to verify your identity?

20
00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:47.966
Uncle Lam, I advise you not to kill yourself and flirt with girls in advance.

21
00:00:48.266 --> 00:00:49.466
Not that you can stand it.

22
00:00:49.466 --> 00:00:51.266
If you find nonsense, say do you dare?

23
00:00:51.333 --> 00:00:53.566
Our concubines are a real down payment.

24
00:00:53.566 --> 00:00:54.666
There's nothing you don't dare to do

25
00:00:54.666 --> 00:00:57.366
Cut, go to market now, sweep the elevator away.

26
00:00:57.366 --> 00:00:58.766
Make you completely die from this mind.

27
00:00:58.766 --> 00:00:59.900
Wait, kid.

28
00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:01.200
Don't listen, everyone.

29
00:01:08.666 --> 00:01:10.800
Since you also said you are a down payment

30
00:01:10.866 --> 00:01:13.100
Then you can certainly open this door to enter.

31
00:01:13.133 --> 00:01:14.833
So if not, brush first.

32
00:01:14.866 --> 00:01:17.700
Anyway, it doesn't matter who comes first, who comes next, right?

33
00:01:17.933 --> 00:01:19.733
Is that Okay? It's OK.

34
00:01:19.733 --> 00:01:21.566
Gently brush, we are your steadfast support.

35
00:01:21.566 --> 00:01:22.366
Not.

36
00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:24.900
I want to see.

37
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.400
How dare you pretend to be a lady?

38
00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:29.633
I don't have a card.

39
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.433
How to brush out?
