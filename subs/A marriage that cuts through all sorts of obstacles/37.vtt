1
00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:01.666
It's my fault.

2
00:00:02.166 --> 00:00:04.566
Daughter-in-law, he is wood.

3
00:00:04.566 --> 00:00:05.866
I don't know how to hurt people

4
00:00:05.866 --> 00:00:07.066
She took him away.

5
00:00:07.066 --> 00:00:08.266
You did wrong.

6
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:10.733
Have a grandmother who loves you.

7
00:00:10.733 --> 00:00:12.133
What if he dares to bully you?

8
00:00:12.133 --> 00:00:13.966
Tell me, my friend.

9
00:00:13.966 --> 00:00:15.200
You also say it's unreasonable.

10
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.100
Grandma, you are so cute.

11
00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:19.300
I will definitely come more often to be with you in the future.

12
00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:20.466
Good night.

13
00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.566
During those years he was very good to me.

14
00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.900
As soon as she got married, she already knew she was like her husband.

15
00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:32.300
Hey girl.

16
00:00:32.333 --> 00:00:33.600
How old are you?

17
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.533
Whose daughter is she?

18
00:00:35.533 --> 00:00:37.800
I am 25 years old, I am Bang Dien Group.

19
00:00:41.333 --> 00:00:43.533
Don't be sad in front of grandma

20
00:00:43.533 --> 00:00:44.500
He is not a passerby.

21
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:45.300
Just one

22
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:46.800
Grandma.

23
00:00:47.333 --> 00:00:49.466
Even though he came from a poor background

24
00:00:49.533 --> 00:00:52.100
But leaving delivery hits the staff to make money.

25
00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.233
He tries very hard.

26
00:00:53.466 --> 00:00:55.633
Like a small sun

27
00:00:56.266 --> 00:00:57.633
You will deliver.

28
00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:00.766
Girl, you've been so tough.

29
00:01:00.766 --> 00:01:02.733
But let's marry into a rich family.

30
00:01:02.733 --> 00:01:05.000
No need to worry about money anymore.

31
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.366
I give you a bracelet of 300 million.

32
00:01:08.966 --> 00:01:10.600
Three hundred million bracelets

33
00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.300
Don't you also lie?
