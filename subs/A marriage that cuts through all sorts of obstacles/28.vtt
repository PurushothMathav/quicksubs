00:00:01.966 --> 00:00:03.466
Is this house yours?

2
00:00:03.466 --> 00:00:04.500
No, I will pay you.

3
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.633
Now you quickly send the two of them away for me.

4
00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:08.133
I can't lose my face.

5
00:00:08.133 --> 00:00:10.066
The security guard and I can't beat you.

6
00:00:10.333 --> 00:00:11.500
Trash.

7
00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:14.966
Using force cannot solve any problem.

8
00:00:14.966 --> 00:00:17.966
I want to find a way to deal with this bitch once and for all.

9
00:00:17.966 --> 00:00:20.000
I can't let him appear in front of me anymore.

10
00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:27.566
Uncle Lam.

11
00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.866
Today is a good day for me and Curtin.

12
00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:33.800
You see, you live very happily now.

13
00:00:34.266 --> 00:00:36.300
Don't bother us two anymore.

14
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.666
What happened today was a misunderstanding.

15
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.833
Why don't we drink together?

16
00:00:40.866 --> 00:00:43.366
Today this matter seems to have turned over, how is it?

17
00:00:43.366 --> 00:00:45.066
It was your fault from start to finish.

18
00:00:45.066 --> 00:00:46.866
What can I drink with you?

19
00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:50.100
Oh.

20
00:00:52.766 --> 00:00:54.400
What's going on?

21
00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.933
This is a one-for-one value red wine.

22
00:00:56.933 --> 00:00:57.833
Tieu Thanh.

23
00:00:58.933 --> 00:01:01.066
I just lent you my room card to get married.

24
00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.300
You let your wife marry something that ruins the homeowner.

25
00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:05.400
I will work for you later.

26
00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:06.766
I come here.

27
00:01:06.766 --> 00:01:08.766
Just want everyone to have a drink together.

28
00:01:08.766 --> 00:01:10.200
This story is over again.

29
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.600
YES.

30
00:01:11.733 --> 00:01:13.733
Uncle Lam, he did it on purpose.

31
00:01:13.733 --> 00:01:14.533
Manage

32
00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.866
You have to call the police and arrest him for me.

33
00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:19.366
This is this is one hundred million.

34
00:01:19.366 --> 00:01:20.900
Report to the police.

35
00:01:20.933 --> 00:01:22.500
I haven't touched it yet.

36
00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:23.766
Also, this red wine is mine.

37
00:01:23.766 --> 00:01:25.000
If I want to fight, I will fight.

38
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.500
Protect.

39
00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.066
Don't be afraid, my people are coming.
