00:00:03.866 --> 00:00:07.366
The romance of paying it forward is as simple as that.

2
00:00:07.866 --> 00:00:08.866
Wait a few more years.

3
00:00:08.866 --> 00:00:10.600
Be sure to guess what's inside

4
00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:11.466
Honey.

5
00:00:16.066 --> 00:00:16.666
This.

6
00:00:16.666 --> 00:00:19.600
I have prepared for you villa number 999 of sweet ice products.

7
00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:20.800
As a wedding gift.

8
00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.733
Do you want to go see it later?

9
00:00:22.733 --> 00:00:24.866
Surely you will like it.

10
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.433
Sweet ice number 999

11
00:00:27.966 --> 00:00:29.800
Sweet ice a product

12
00:00:33.866 --> 00:00:35.166
Numbers 9-99 are better.

13
00:00:37.266 --> 00:00:40.066
Okay, dad, I'll wait for you.

14
00:00:41.666 --> 00:00:43.100
Boasting again

15
00:00:43.366 --> 00:00:45.600
Bang Thien Nhat San's luxurious house costs at least one hundred million

16
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.566
More so are the top ones like 666 and 999.

17
00:00:48.566 --> 00:00:50.600
That value is 10 times normal.

18
00:00:50.733 --> 00:00:52.600
So how can you not buy it?

19
00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:55.366
He made friends again.

20
00:01:07.066 --> 00:01:09.766
999, that's right.

21
00:01:10.333 --> 00:01:13.466
Oh, who is this?

22
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.166
Surely you haven't spent the entire family?

23
00:01:16.166 --> 00:01:16.966
Money can be exchanged.

24
00:01:16.966 --> 00:01:18.566
The one-day experience card has expired.

25
00:01:18.566 --> 00:01:20.033
Now beaten back to its original form.

26
00:01:20.166 --> 00:01:22.500
Ferry come here and fix my house.

27
00:01:25.666 --> 00:01:28.400
Since when is my house your house?
