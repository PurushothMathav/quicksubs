1
00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:03.400
Liu Dien Nien Long Truyen of the four great generations was born first

2
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.033
I talked about the heir.

3
00:00:05.266 --> 00:00:07.666
Damn it, we're adults.

4
00:00:07.666 --> 00:00:08.866
Oh no.

5
00:00:09.133 --> 00:00:10.666
Don't panic.

6
00:00:10.733 --> 00:00:16.100
Everyone who meets this says that my master prolongs my life, ha ha

7
00:00:17.066 --> 00:00:20.700
The person in charge of Fuji Than Long Group can see the head but not the tail

8
00:00:20.866 --> 00:00:22.066
No one has seen it.

9
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.400
On the contrary, I, Long Xuyen, become rich every day and become a sword god.

10
00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:26.666
Let's get to know each other.

11
00:00:26.666 --> 00:00:29.233
Is what I said fake?

12
00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.133
General Director Manh is right.

13
00:00:31.133 --> 00:00:33.800
If you lie, this is your father.

14
00:00:33.866 --> 00:00:36.100
Ha ha ha, don't go away yet.

15
00:00:36.133 --> 00:00:37.933
Block the eyes of our richest daughter.

16
00:00:37.933 --> 00:00:40.266
Today will make it impossible for you to live in the countryside.

17
00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:41.566
I am the richest person.

18
00:00:41.866 --> 00:00:44.033
Dare to talk nonsense with me again, I will leave it to you

19
00:00:46.566 --> 00:00:48.100
Stop arguing with these powers.

20
00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:49.866
Forgery on tape

21
00:00:50.066 --> 00:00:52.700
It's a big deal, and it's not easy for me to handle.

22
00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:55.266
I have booked a private room.

23
00:00:55.266 --> 00:00:57.300
Now you come here as my wife.

24
00:00:57.466 --> 00:00:58.766
Might as well hit them in the face.

25
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.700
Private rooms at Long Xuyen hotel sell for at least 1 million VND.

26
00:01:01.733 --> 00:01:02.933
You booked a private room for me.

27
00:01:02.933 --> 00:01:04.900
I'm afraid even my wife is done with it.

28
00:01:05.366 --> 00:01:06.733
Just some of my pocket money.

29
00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:08.466
Don't hit your swollen face anymore.

30
00:01:08.466 --> 00:01:09.366
You are a good man.

31
00:01:09.366 --> 00:01:11.600
I can't spend your money, and I can't let you be wronged.

32
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.000
You wait for me to call now and bite someone.

33
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.966
Get it out for you

34
00:01:22.666 --> 00:01:23.466
Stop pretending.

35
00:01:23.466 --> 00:01:25.566
A chicken using a low-end domestic cell phone

36
00:01:25.566 --> 00:01:27.500
Also dares to pretend to be Kim Phuong Hoang of high society

37
00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.300
Only you still call and shake people.

38
00:01:30.466 --> 00:01:32.566
You can call empty numbers now, right?
