1
00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.466
That fake card has been removed and is still here.

2
00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:05.500
If you're really perfunctory

3
00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:07.366
Then buy this store.

4
00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.933
See if your fake card can withdraw money.

5
00:00:09.933 --> 00:00:12.500
Okay, immediately contact your boss.

6
00:00:12.533 --> 00:00:13.966
I can pay now.

7
00:00:14.133 --> 00:00:16.166
On the contrary, this procedure you determine is adequate.

8
00:00:16.766 --> 00:00:18.400
Do you have my ability?

9
00:00:18.466 --> 00:00:20.566
You finally remember that I am Than Bat Tien Kinh.

10
00:00:20.666 --> 00:00:22.700
I'm talking about him.

11
00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:24.800
I know we're both not real.

12
00:00:27.166 --> 00:00:29.966
Are you doubting Miss Lam's strength?

13
00:00:29.966 --> 00:00:31.500
Just a high end store.

14
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.200
It's just Miss Lam's daily allowance.

15
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.200
Great lady.

16
00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.266
Please help these two poor devils open their eyes.

17
00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.200
Where do I buy electricity?

18
00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.500
Cortin, you really love me, right?

19
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:45.400
Of course.

20
00:00:45.966 --> 00:00:47.400
So in this case

21
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:48.966
To show your sincerity

22
00:00:48.966 --> 00:00:51.800
Please help me buy this store.

23
00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.766
She doesn't want to.

24
00:00:55.966 --> 00:00:56.800
So I can't get down.

25
00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.033
Hey, don't, don't, don't.

26
00:00:58.466 --> 00:01:01.800
This person really lied to me, where will he get so much money now?

27
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.166
But pay up.

28
00:01:03.166 --> 00:01:05.766
You can receive signed orders from Bang Dien Group.

29
00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.300
Until then, do the experiment.

30
00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.766
I can't bear to leave my child behind so I can't catch the wolf

31
00:01:11.666 --> 00:01:14.666
Is one hundred million not enough?

32
00:01:15.333 --> 00:01:16.500
I paid 2 billion.

33
00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:17.600
Contact you now

34
00:01:18.466 --> 00:01:20.566
I paid 3 billion 4 billion.

35
00:01:21.766 --> 00:01:24.600
This posture is becoming more and more outrageous.

36
00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.566
On a side note, where did you get so much money?

37
00:01:26.866 --> 00:01:28.500
If he really wants this store

38
00:01:28.766 --> 00:01:30.266
But not as good as me.

39
00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:33.566
If you keep it, immediately take this from Long Xuyen number one.

40
00:01:33.566 --> 00:01:35.233
The costume shop is going to buy it for me.
