1
00:00:02.866 --> 00:00:03.766
Pay me in advance.

2
00:00:03.766 --> 00:00:04.566
Lam evacuated

3
00:00:04.766 --> 00:00:08.133
This prepaid position is not even Mr. Lam's turn to do.

4
00:00:08.133 --> 00:00:09.800
He said he was the down payment.

5
00:00:09.966 --> 00:00:12.366
Isn't that right? Who is this?

6
00:00:12.933 --> 00:00:14.700
Don't let him fool you.

7
00:00:15.133 --> 00:00:16.433
This woman is a liar.

8
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.300
I'm the one who actually pays it forward.

9
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.733
Previously this woman lived in the countryside

10
00:00:19.733 --> 00:00:21.133
Reported my identity multiple times.

11
00:00:21.133 --> 00:00:22.500
Fraud in the countryside

12
00:00:22.733 --> 00:00:25.200
The nobles in the countryside can all testify to me.

13
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:26.166
Nonsense.

14
00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.966
Co Tu, you are just a maid.

15
00:00:28.966 --> 00:00:30.366
Identify yourself.

16
00:00:30.366 --> 00:00:32.733
Now you go down, I can still let you go.

17
00:00:32.733 --> 00:00:35.500
If not, there is no place for you.

18
00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.166
Women in the hospital

19
00:00:37.566 --> 00:00:40.266
Let this little fairy hit the mouse.

20
00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:42.700
I am lady sutra.

21
00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:45.533
Previously, she lived next door but appeared wearing a maid outfit.

22
00:00:45.533 --> 00:00:47.366
Ah, isn't that going too deep into the drama?

23
00:00:47.566 --> 00:00:48.833
Still not awake?

24
00:00:48.933 --> 00:00:50.566
I couldn't recognize him.

25
00:00:54.533 --> 00:00:56.333
Please don't cause any more trouble.

26
00:00:56.333 --> 00:00:57.700
Aunt, why are you here?

27
00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:59.166
It's not that you don't say goodbye.

28
00:00:59.166 --> 00:01:00.433
I'm worried about you.

29
00:01:00.466 --> 00:01:02.233
I wrote to you.

30
00:01:03.733 --> 00:01:04.533
Letters

31
00:01:04.966 --> 00:01:06.033
Ah, leave me alone first.

32
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.366
You will be the richest person

33
00:01:07.366 --> 00:01:08.166
Come with me.

34
00:01:08.666 --> 00:01:10.333
I'm really the richest girl

35
00:01:10.333 --> 00:01:12.400
Today I will destroy the corrupt for my neighbors.

36
00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:13.300
You show me.

37
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.100
I remember now.

38
00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.066
Some time ago I went on a business trip to Long Xuyen.

39
00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.366
The new wife of the rich man Long Xuyen

40
00:01:19.366 --> 00:01:21.300
Seems delusional.

41
00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:24.266
When I meet someone, I say I'm the richest girl

42
00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.366
The rich man performed a play with him

43
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.900
It took a lot of effort.

44
00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.200
You're just delusional.

45
00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.566
I'm real.
