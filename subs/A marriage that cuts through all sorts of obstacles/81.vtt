00:00:00.733 --> 00:00:03.066
Go away, son.

2
00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:04.500
It's okay to insult me.

3
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.333
Now I can still meet my second uncle's friend here.

4
00:00:06.333 --> 00:00:08.766
Today, even if the Heavenly King comes, I cannot save you.

5
00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:09.666
Let's go.

6
00:00:10.866 --> 00:00:12.900
Brother-in-law, I pulled out the scrap.

7
00:00:12.933 --> 00:00:13.966
Ha ha.

8
00:00:14.866 --> 00:00:16.066
Sorry.

9
00:00:16.066 --> 00:00:17.466
He seduced me.

10
00:00:17.766 --> 00:00:20.233
Sorry, it's not my fault.

11
00:00:20.966 --> 00:00:22.366
Leave it to this old lady

12
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:23.766
Bring him and let me steal things too.

13
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.733
Quickly take these two people to South Africa to dig mines.

14
00:00:27.733 --> 00:00:29.500
Uncle, please save me!

15
00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.033
I'm not a mother-in-law.

16
00:00:31.166 --> 00:00:32.066
Not what you said

17
00:00:32.066 --> 00:00:34.533
Do you always think of me as your father?

18
00:00:34.533 --> 00:00:35.666
Uncle, go away.

19
00:00:35.666 --> 00:00:37.166
Save me!

20
00:00:37.533 --> 00:00:40.233
Uncle, a cruel fox like you only knows how to climb dragons and phoenixes.

21
00:00:40.733 --> 00:00:41.566
Right here.

22
00:00:43.166 --> 00:00:45.466
Second master, give me another chance.

23
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.400
For my sake as a child.

24
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:48.266
Please give me another chance.

25
00:00:48.266 --> 00:00:49.700
Can you forgive me this time?

26
00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.300
Are not!

27
00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:53.300
Don't trust him.

28
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:54.366
He doesn't have it.

29
00:00:57.766 --> 00:01:00.366
You whore.

30
00:01:00.366 --> 00:01:02.200
Don't you dare lie to me.

31
00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:03.700
Say it.

32
00:01:04.566 --> 00:01:06.366
He impersonates your identity.

33
00:01:07.266 --> 00:01:09.500
Save money and sometimes get your revenge.

34
00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.900
Let's go.

35
00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:12.633
This bitch.

36
00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.000
Send me to northern Myanmar.

37
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.200
Uncle!

38
00:01:20.566 --> 00:01:23.666
This slap is to beat you for being ungrateful.

39
00:01:27.933 --> 00:01:28.966
This slap.

40
00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.000
Is beating you into impersonating my identity.

41
00:01:31.466 --> 00:01:33.866
This slap has been my fault for three years.

42
00:01:33.966 --> 00:01:36.166
When I said goodbye, I told you not to regret it.

43
00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.166
If you look down on the little people

44
00:01:38.166 --> 00:01:40.466
So stay forever in the world of little people.

45
00:01:41.266 --> 00:01:43.933
Someone is here, take it out.

46
00:01:43.933 --> 00:01:45.966
No, no, you let me in.

47
00:01:46.533 --> 00:01:48.200
Oh my.

48
00:01:48.466 --> 00:01:49.400
I'm going brother.

49
00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:50.300
I am mother-in-law.

50
00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:51.500
Save me.
