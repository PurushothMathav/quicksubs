00:00:02.133 --> 00:00:03.300
You burn money.

2
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:04.400
Let me borrow this.

3
00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.566
Now you are not the protector of money.

4
00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:08.500
He always uses my identity.

5
00:00:08.766 --> 00:00:10.166
You fart.

6
00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:12.766
Deputy general manager, this gives you peace of mind.

7
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.800
Is the crazy woman in the house doing something here?

8
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.666
Could it be that you, the richest person in Long Xuyen, have won?

9
00:00:18.666 --> 00:00:20.166
The richest man in the Dragon Nation declared war

10
00:00:26.966 --> 00:00:28.466
This hand of yours is too fast, isn't it?

11
00:00:28.466 --> 00:00:29.766
Tear it for me first.

12
00:00:30.366 --> 00:00:32.000
Luckily this is Long Xuyen.

13
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.633
The other side of the ice field will not call immediately.

14
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.266
Come with me.

15
00:00:36.933 --> 00:00:37.833
No problem.

16
00:00:47.133 --> 00:00:48.566
Now I officially announce

17
00:00:48.766 --> 00:00:52.033
Method of cooperation for hundreds of billions of orders of Bang Dien Group

18
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.233
Long Xuyen Fuji

19
00:01:03.166 --> 00:01:04.066
Miss Han.

20
00:01:04.466 --> 00:01:06.600
This is the new product you prepared for Fuji Group.

21
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:07.400
Order

22
00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:14.900
Rett is coming.

23
00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:16.766
It seems that the person on stage is the real richest person.

24
00:01:16.766 --> 00:01:17.666
Great lady.

25
00:01:17.666 --> 00:01:19.800
You say this is so big.

26
00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:24.200
This time, the debt to Reidu is too big.

27
00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:26.400
Is uncle Lam really paying in advance?

28
00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:27.900
Whether he is or not.

29
00:01:28.166 --> 00:01:30.033
New dive orders cannot be placed.

30
00:01:30.366 --> 00:01:31.666
I still go to the temple first.

31
00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:39.533
Clothes of poor quality

32
00:01:39.533 --> 00:01:40.966
It doesn't look like real money.

33
00:01:40.966 --> 00:01:42.700
Get out! Get out!

34
00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.666
Get out! Get out!

35
00:01:45.566 --> 00:01:48.800
This is the kindness you talk about at Gaudin's store.
