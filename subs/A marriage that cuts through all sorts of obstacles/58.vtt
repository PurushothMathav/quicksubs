00:00:01.166 --> 00:00:04.400
You, you are really the richest person in the countryside perfunctory you

2
00:00:05.266 --> 00:00:06.333
Exchange fake goods

3
00:00:06.333 --> 00:00:08.566
Turns out I always misunderstood.

4
00:00:08.566 --> 00:00:10.066
Dead.

5
00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:11.800
What a shame.

6
00:00:13.333 --> 00:00:15.866
My grandmother and assistant Little have both met.

7
00:00:16.166 --> 00:00:17.766
You small minded thing.

8
00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:19.233
What is it?

9
00:00:22.466 --> 00:00:24.133
Truly the richest man in Long Xuyen.

10
00:00:24.133 --> 00:00:26.600
Why do you say this bitch has such a good life?

11
00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.300
It's over, I have offended Pho Dien Nien.

12
00:00:29.333 --> 00:00:32.233
The kitten story is about to be revealed.

13
00:00:32.966 --> 00:00:33.900
Don't cause any more trouble.

14
00:00:33.966 --> 00:00:35.166
You go up again, you go up again.

15
00:00:35.166 --> 00:00:36.600
Help me.

16
00:00:36.666 --> 00:00:37.500
Please save us.

17
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.266
This is an internal struggle in Long Xuyen.

18
00:00:39.266 --> 00:00:41.100
It has nothing to do with our Bang Dien Group.

19
00:00:42.733 --> 00:00:44.600
We are only for you.

20
00:00:44.666 --> 00:00:45.466
We.

21
00:00:45.466 --> 00:00:47.766
Your deputy director doesn't want to bow his head and quickly doesn't want to live anymore.

22
00:00:47.766 --> 00:00:50.166
Okay, okay, ha ha.

23
00:00:50.533 --> 00:00:51.400
Vice president

24
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:52.966
I'm afraid of having helpless eyes.

25
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.233
Save me, feed us.

26
00:00:55.666 --> 00:00:57.600
Sorry, then our vice president

27
00:00:57.733 --> 00:00:59.633
Let me spare your three families.

28
00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.666
Maybe ha ha but

29
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.800
The intelligence quotients of our three heirs are not enough.

30
00:01:06.866 --> 00:01:09.200
Impossible, impossible.

31
00:01:09.266 --> 00:01:11.200
If you cancel them

32
00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.800
I can consider forgiving your three families.

33
00:01:16.066 --> 00:01:17.466
Thank you vice president.

34
00:01:17.466 --> 00:01:19.300
I arranged for this woman to go abroad.

35
00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:22.366
Roll away! Roll away!

36
00:01:24.966 --> 00:01:25.766
Daughter-in-law

37
00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.466
Aren't you the richest man in a thousand troops?

38
00:01:37.766 --> 00:01:39.433
Why doesn't the richest person in Long Xuyen know?

39
00:01:39.933 --> 00:01:42.966
Bang Dien Group is the richest person in dragon fruit.

40
00:01:43.066 --> 00:01:44.933
The richest man in Goroncheon has abundant power.

41
00:01:44.933 --> 00:01:46.633
Small role as perfunctory year

42
00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.433
Of course I've never seen it.

43
00:01:48.566 --> 00:01:50.066
Not knowing is also normal.

44
00:01:50.933 --> 00:01:52.033
I'm done.

45
00:01:52.133 --> 00:01:54.666
I really offended Pho Dien Nien, the richest man in the countryside.

46
00:01:54.866 --> 00:01:56.566
The countryside is, after all, the domain of the rich.

47
00:01:56.866 --> 00:01:58.700
And the Emperor Park high mountain group

48
00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.366
Can't find my house.

49
00:02:00.366 --> 00:02:02.766
How can the La family live in the countryside in the future?

50
00:02:10.466 --> 00:02:12.500
Vice President, I'll give you a toast.

51
00:02:12.766 --> 00:02:14.500
I had a misunderstanding before.

52
00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.233
Now the misunderstanding has been cleared.

53
00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.600
We will turn Gange into Jade Bo.

54
00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:20.900
In the future, we will make money together

55
00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:22.100
Okay.

56
00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.000
Transform Gan Ge into Ngoc Bo.

57
00:02:28.966 --> 00:02:31.366
Okay, haha.

58
00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.600
So he knelt down and apologized to my wife.

59
00:02:37.533 --> 00:02:41.500
So we can turn Gange into Jade Lady.
