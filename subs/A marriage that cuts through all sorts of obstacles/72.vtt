1
00:00:03.066 --> 00:00:06.366
Um, Sisi doesn't need a second grandfather to buy a bag.

2
00:00:06.566 --> 00:00:08.033
Just need second master

3
00:00:08.666 --> 00:00:10.100
One kiss is enough.

4
00:00:11.733 --> 00:00:13.633
Yes, Sisi understands.

5
00:00:14.133 --> 00:00:16.100
If I'm sure, I'll stay by your side

6
00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:18.366
Breathing in confidence is beneficial to the Second Family.

7
00:00:18.666 --> 00:00:21.300
Help the Second family build a family

8
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.433
Let Co Tu sleep later, check in and get coffee.

9
00:00:28.166 --> 00:00:29.033
Great lady.

10
00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:33.566
Right.

11
00:00:33.866 --> 00:00:36.200
About the Second Master intercepting additional attacks.

12
00:00:36.333 --> 00:00:38.633
But Lam Thien Nhi will say this again later.

13
00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:41.700
Take these important documents first.

14
00:00:41.933 --> 00:00:42.900
Put the others here.

15
00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:44.700
Okay.

16
00:00:45.933 --> 00:00:47.866
Oh, yeah, and that too.

17
00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:50.700
HAS.

18
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.000
Information about that project will be placed here first.

19
00:00:53.166 --> 00:00:54.366
No problem.

20
00:00:56.166 --> 00:00:57.100
Lemon coffee

21
00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:59.000
HAS.

22
00:00:59.366 --> 00:01:02.700
Ah, yes, yes, sorry, sorry.

23
00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:04.766
Me, I haven't been a maid for too long.

24
00:01:04.766 --> 00:01:05.733
I I didn't mean it.

25
00:01:05.733 --> 00:01:08.233
It's okay, you can clean this up.

26
00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:09.566
I'm going to change.

27
00:01:09.866 --> 00:01:11.800
Don't rush.

28
00:01:34.333 --> 00:01:36.100
Turns out it was to steal information.

29
00:01:36.566 --> 00:01:37.866
Let Ms. Thuy monitor closely.

30
00:01:37.866 --> 00:01:40.266
At that time, it's okay to return the money.

31
00:01:43.866 --> 00:01:45.000
I have already arranged it.

32
00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.133
That's right, you are Lam Thien.

33
00:01:47.133 --> 00:01:48.100
What's going on?
