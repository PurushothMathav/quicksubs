00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.600
Nian, I have urgent work to get home.

2
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:23.866
Wait for me to come back.

3
00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:33.100
Are not.

4
00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.733
Long legs.

5
00:00:34.733 --> 00:00:37.533
Can such a big gentle head be hidden here?

6
00:00:37.533 --> 00:00:40.366
Didn't you go on vacation to Dubai?

7
00:00:40.366 --> 00:00:42.033
Has the airport arrived yet?

8
00:00:44.466 --> 00:00:45.400
Buy a phone

9
00:00:45.866 --> 00:00:47.233
Bang Bang turned around.

10
00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:51.400
Hey, don't be in a hurry.

11
00:00:52.666 --> 00:00:54.733
How are you, ma'am?

12
00:00:54.733 --> 00:00:56.466
I've seen the surveillance cameras.

13
00:00:56.466 --> 00:00:58.366
This woman went up the back garden hill.

14
00:00:58.366 --> 00:00:59.666
In the morning there are also brothers.

15
00:00:59.666 --> 00:01:01.800
Vaguely heard the sound of a helicopter.

16
00:01:01.866 --> 00:01:03.266
You said he wouldn't

17
00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.266
Go by helicopter.

18
00:01:07.866 --> 00:01:08.966
He comes from poverty.

19
00:01:08.966 --> 00:01:11.000
It was impossible to pick him up by helicopter.

20
00:01:12.133 --> 00:01:13.800
Maybe our house is too big.

21
00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.500
Otherwise, it will be lost. Take the brothers to the next mountain to look for it.

22
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.333
Why are you still standing there? Go find it.

23
00:01:21.333 --> 00:01:22.666
I went to the mountain first to look.

24
00:01:32.266 --> 00:01:33.266
Today is...

25
00:01:34.333 --> 00:01:35.133
He has
