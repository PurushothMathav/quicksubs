00:00:03.566 --> 00:00:04.700
Are you dependent on him?

2
00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:07.233
Yes, Rett said this person is very trustworthy.

3
00:00:07.333 --> 00:00:09.266
And he is very loyal to me.

4
00:00:09.266 --> 00:00:10.566
No matter what I do

5
00:00:10.566 --> 00:00:11.766
He always climaxes for me.

6
00:00:14.166 --> 00:00:15.466
He will take care of you like that.

7
00:00:15.466 --> 00:00:16.766
It's because I gave him a re-interview before.

Unlimited black card

9
00:00:18.733 --> 00:00:20.633
The person who really helps you is me.

10
00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:23.833
Why are you suddenly so angry?

11
00:00:28.066 --> 00:00:29.366
Are you jealous?

12
00:00:30.333 --> 00:00:32.233
You ate the vinegar from the thunder head column, right?

13
00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.766
Before, someone said I only needed someone I liked

14
00:00:35.766 --> 00:00:37.433
Will divorce me immediately.

15
00:00:37.666 --> 00:00:38.466
You.

16
00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:40.100
Do you like Reidu?

17
00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:41.500
So...

18
00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:43.633
If I say yes

19
00:00:43.733 --> 00:00:44.866
What will you do?

20
00:00:45.133 --> 00:00:46.800
Will you immediately divorce me?

21
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.466
No, because no one is better than me.

22
00:00:54.766 --> 00:00:56.033
More suitable for you

23
00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.266
So if not

24
00:01:01.966 --> 00:01:04.966
Let's first try talking about love or something.

25
00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:10.333
But in love

26
00:01:10.333 --> 00:01:11.666
We must be loyal to each other.

27
00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:13.300
Can you talk to Reiter?

28
00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.200
Keep your distance.

29
00:01:31.566 --> 00:01:32.200
Great lady.

30
00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.666
The second master is preparing to attack the vice president's property.

31
00:01:34.933 --> 00:01:35.900
He dares
