1
00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:05.433
Grandma ordered a dress from this store.

2
00:00:05.533 --> 00:00:07.800
That's right.

3
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:10.566
Grandma is very sick.

4
00:00:10.766 --> 00:00:13.466
This store is the highest point in the countryside.

5
00:00:13.466 --> 00:00:14.333
Dress here

6
00:00:14.333 --> 00:00:15.500
Order any one.

7
00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.433
Ordinary people struggle for many lives

8
00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.466
Where did grandma get so much money?

9
00:00:20.533 --> 00:00:22.166
Luckily, I also ordered one here.

10
00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:23.900
Can help the fainting grandmother.

11
00:00:24.466 --> 00:00:26.033
Doing what?

12
00:00:26.133 --> 00:00:27.933
Do you know where this is?

13
00:00:27.933 --> 00:00:29.100
Dare to rush in

14
00:00:29.333 --> 00:00:30.100
You don't change.

15
00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:30.966
What's up?

16
00:00:31.066 --> 00:00:33.266
We are not ordinary female compatriots here.

17
00:00:33.466 --> 00:00:34.366
You guys pressed hard

18
00:00:34.366 --> 00:00:37.600
Cao Tien was exclusive at the hotel and casually accepted a dress.

19
00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.566
All are shipped by air from Australia.

20
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.500
The cheapest one is 30 million.

21
00:00:43.266 --> 00:00:46.200
See if this outfit of yours adds up to no more than 300 VND.

22
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.200
Can poor people buy it?

23
00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.033
Don't have dog eyes looking at short people.

24
00:00:51.133 --> 00:00:53.533
You dress like a dog.

25
00:00:53.533 --> 00:00:56.033
But then you won't be with this kind of poor people.

26
00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.800
You are not a rich person either.

27
00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.866
Just your Armani suit.

28
00:00:59.866 --> 00:01:01.600
It's probably fake too.

29
00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.033
Oh, poor body, quickly roll away.

30
00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:08.733
This is the richest person in Long Xuyen.

31
00:01:08.733 --> 00:01:11.566
The story family's only supreme princess card

32
00:01:11.666 --> 00:01:12.300
Day water

33
00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:14.600
Don't say this dress is 30 million for you.

34
00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:15.533
That's 3 billion.

35
00:01:15.533 --> 00:01:18.000
Three hundred million, I can easily make money.
