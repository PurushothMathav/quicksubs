00:00:03.366 --> 00:00:04.466
Sorry.

2
00:00:04.466 --> 00:00:06.500
I forgot to bring it when I went out this morning.

3
00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:10.400
But you come to our rich house, I will give it back to you.

4
00:00:10.466 --> 00:00:11.266
Okay.

5
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.366
This is not my performance.

6
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:17.466
It seems like the acting of the year on the sidelines is exclusive.

7
00:00:17.966 --> 00:00:20.366
This is why grandma wants to get married.

8
00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:23.200
Hey, when are you guys getting married?

9
00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.100
Our rich mother's wedding.

10
00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:26.033
Can't go to dinner.

11
00:00:26.333 --> 00:00:30.266
Do you like islands or old castles?

12
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.866
I love.

13
00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:35.100
You see I ask you like that, how do you choose?

14
00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:40.133
Hey, you have 3 days to prepare 10 sets of wedding plans.

15
00:00:40.133 --> 00:00:41.900
Put that Maldives

16
00:00:41.933 --> 00:00:43.100
Um, Bali.

17
00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.933
It's best to sort all the European babies in.

18
00:00:45.933 --> 00:00:46.533
Besides

19
00:00:46.533 --> 00:00:50.100
Prepare some plans for a farm worker's Chinese-style wedding.

20
00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.766
Let my niece-in-law think carefully.

21
00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.666
Who's exaggerating?

22
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.933
Why not use girls?

23
00:00:57.933 --> 00:01:00.700
An important day in life cannot be perfunctory.

24
00:01:00.933 --> 00:01:02.800
You must prepare well.

25
00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.000
By the way, where do you guys live?

26
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.766
A year will take you back.

27
00:01:08.766 --> 00:01:10.900
Today we live in a private house.

28
00:01:15.866 --> 00:01:19.000
Madam, would you like to have a health check-up now?

29
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.066
Oh, I have a niece-in-law.

30
00:01:21.066 --> 00:01:23.866
Every day is full of strength and convenience.

31
00:01:30.333 --> 00:01:32.066
Even a grandmother cannot do it.

32
00:01:32.066 --> 00:01:33.900
Honey, you're in a hurry too, aren't you?

33
00:01:43.933 --> 00:01:46.100
It turned out that my grandmother had Alzheimer's disease.

34
00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.633
No wonder she considers herself the boss's grandmother.

35
00:01:48.866 --> 00:01:51.000
He tried so hard to play the role of boss

36
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.966
Is it to serve grandmother?

37
00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.100
Oh, it's so hard.
