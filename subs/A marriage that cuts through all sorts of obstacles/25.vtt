00:00:00.666 --> 00:00:03.500
This is a good opportunity for me to marry Bang Dien Group.

2
00:00:03.666 --> 00:00:05.266
I can't let money always talk to me.

3
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.233
- Of course.

4
00:00:07.366 --> 00:00:08.666
So let's talk privately.

5
00:00:08.666 --> 00:00:09.533
What's inside?

6
00:00:09.533 --> 00:00:12.633
Who's right, whose house is this?

7
00:00:13.733 --> 00:00:15.366
Okay, wait a minute.

8
00:00:16.066 --> 00:00:17.866
If Cortin is right today...

9
00:00:17.866 --> 00:00:19.866
You don't just have to kneel down and apologize to me.

10
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.666
Her husband also had to kneel down with her.

11
00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.300
Take what we had to endure at Long Xuyen Hotel that day.

12
00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.233
They all suffered again.

13
00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.400
Sorry, I don't do it by hand.

14
00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.866
Nothing.

15
00:00:34.866 --> 00:00:37.000
I returned the order to buy a house that can be stopped.

16
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.066
Also bought this set as a gift for Uncle Le.

17
00:00:39.166 --> 00:00:40.233
Not a lie.

18
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.300
So you guys say it first.

19
00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:48.900
The wedding room is nothing more than a bubble of diamond flowers.

20
00:00:50.466 --> 00:00:51.600
So I said.

21
00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:53.966
Inside there is an insurance box.

22
00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.833
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha no.

23
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:04.866
Who will place the safe in the wedding room?

24
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.300
You're sure.

25
00:01:07.366 --> 00:01:09.400
Uncle Lam, you are a lowly person.

26
00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.900
I don't know what's normal inside a rich family's wedding room.

27
00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:13.433
Stop talking nonsense.

28
00:01:13.933 --> 00:01:15.066
Have you laughed enough?

29
00:01:15.066 --> 00:01:16.166
If you laugh enough

30
00:01:16.166 --> 00:01:18.766
If not, let's go to the wedding room to check it out.

31
00:01:18.766 --> 00:01:22.166
Go then go.

32
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.000
Huh?
