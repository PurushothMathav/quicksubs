00:00:09.266 --> 00:00:11.766
This is a big gift that my father spent a lot of money to give me.

I invite you to come to Long Son hotel for dinner.

21
00:01:13.966 --> 00:01:16.166

22
00:01:16.166 --> 00:01:17.800

28
00:01:29.266 --> 00:01:30.100
Goodbye.

29
00:01:32.866 --> 00:01:34.800
Miss, you're back.

30
00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.166

31
00:01:36.166 --> 00:01:37.700

00:01:47.966 --> 00:01:50.200
All of them give me twelve spiritual parts.

37
00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:51.900
Got it?

38
00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.033
Hello.

39
