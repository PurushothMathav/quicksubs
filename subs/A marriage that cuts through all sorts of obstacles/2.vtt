00:00:01.133 --> 00:00:04.166
Today is mine and Curtin's engagement party.

2
00:00:04.166 --> 00:00:07.300
My son is the newly rich man in Long Xuyen.

3
00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:08.600
Value more than 100 million

4
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:10.600
He was the moon that day.

5
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.933
And you are a poor delivery person.

6
00:00:13.933 --> 00:00:15.833
You are the mud on the ground.

7
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.266
Never done.

8
00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.800
The only person worthy of my son is my wife and children, this whole village.

9
00:00:22.066 --> 00:00:24.666
Sister, why did you become like that?

10
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:25.666
Co Kha Dinh

11
00:00:26.133 --> 00:00:27.866
When he and his mother went out to pick up trash.

12
00:00:27.866 --> 00:00:29.100
When it's difficult

13
00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:31.566
I'm a salesman to help you get out of trouble.

14
00:00:31.566 --> 00:00:34.266
I will help you open a company and attract customers.

15
00:00:34.266 --> 00:00:35.600
How could you do this to me?

16
00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.566
No, he actually dared to smear gold on his face.

17
00:00:38.566 --> 00:00:41.200
You just graduated from high school.

18
00:00:41.366 --> 00:00:44.633
Appearance is often just a poor curse for men.

19
00:00:45.366 --> 00:00:46.933
Do you have any skills to help me get started?

20
00:00:46.933 --> 00:00:49.466
Can't I become the new rich man of Long Xuyen?

21
00:00:49.466 --> 00:00:51.300
Completely relying on my own abilities.

22
00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.466
What do you have?

23
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:53.966
Can you be in this old dragon dynasty that fills the world?

24
00:00:53.966 --> 00:00:54.700
Personal mess

25
00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:56.033
It's all because of me.

26
00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.566
The richest daughter of Bang Dien group

27
00:00:57.566 --> 00:00:59.000
In the darkness gives you a way out

28
00:00:59.066 --> 00:01:01.500
Only this meal of yours is not poor.

29
00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.133
Also dare to pretend to be prepaid money.

30
00:01:03.133 --> 00:01:04.666
The living room told me.

31
00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:07.266
As soon as he saw this yellow-faced girl, he immediately felt nauseous.

32
00:01:07.366 --> 00:01:10.600
He hasn't done anything in recent years.

33
00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.400
How can he compare with a baby?

34
00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:14.633
I took a look at him.

35
00:01:14.766 --> 00:01:16.466
Annoying me to sit one night in a nightmare

36
00:01:16.466 --> 00:01:18.200
Still having fun with the baby

37
00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.700
That's what kind of woman this is.

38
00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.666
Sticking it upside down is also not what men want.

39
00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.000
It turns out that he has been spoiling Curtin for three years now.

40
00:01:27.266 --> 00:01:29.100
I will make you pay.

41
00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.766
Who says I don't have a man I want?

42
00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:38.966
Do you want to marry me?

43
00:01:41.366 --> 00:01:42.766
I.

44
00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:44.600
He helped me.

45
00:01:44.733 --> 00:01:46.533
Now being bullied is so pathetic.

46
00:01:46.533 --> 00:01:48.066
Help him.

47
00:01:52.766 --> 00:01:54.333
He and you start from scratch.

48
00:01:54.333 --> 00:01:56.133
One look is a gentle and virtuous woman.

49
00:01:56.133 --> 00:01:57.900
Don't leave such a good woman.

50
00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:00.866
To marry a woman who smells of copper.

51
00:02:00.866 --> 00:02:02.566
You are truly blind.

52
00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:06.466
You and me

53
00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.133
Okay, we'll go to the Gree civil office now.

54
00:02:13.133 --> 00:02:14.300
Marry
