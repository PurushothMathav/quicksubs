1
00:00:01.933 --> 00:00:03.500
He is renovating the house.

2
00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:05.700
Don't pretend to do that kind of dirty work anymore.

3
00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:08.266
Oh right, forgot to tell you.

4
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.400
Curtin and I are about to get married.

5
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:12.533
This castle

6
00:00:12.533 --> 00:00:15.266
It was he who bought it to use as our wedding room.

7
00:00:16.966 --> 00:00:19.200
If the living room's entire assets were only one hundred million

8
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.666
Even this toilet cannot be bought.

9
00:00:20.666 --> 00:00:22.866
How can he give you a sweet ice mansion?

10
00:00:23.366 --> 00:00:25.966
I recommend you go and confirm with him.

11
00:00:25.966 --> 00:00:27.733
At that point, I couldn't even get in through the door.

12
00:00:27.733 --> 00:00:28.566
Impossible.

13
00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:30.566
Forget it.

14
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.300
I'll call the living room now.

15
00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:33.666
Leaves you with nothing to say

16
00:00:35.133 --> 00:00:35.733
Manager Vuong

17
00:00:35.733 --> 00:00:39.300
Ha ha ha long time no see, long time no see, ha ha

18
00:00:39.533 --> 00:00:40.733
That's it.

19
00:00:40.733 --> 00:00:42.666
Um, it's not convenient for you to put that.

20
00:00:42.666 --> 00:00:45.300
Cost threshold of villa number 999

21
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.100
Done.

22
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.733
Got married.

23
00:00:48.733 --> 00:00:51.966
Will definitely invite you to drink wedding wine.

24
00:00:52.366 --> 00:00:54.000
Say it.

25
00:00:55.133 --> 00:00:58.433
Ha ha ha, anyway, the owner of number 999 has never lived there.

26
00:00:58.466 --> 00:01:02.266
It's not impossible to suggest staying for two days, ha ha.

27
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.066
Don't touch the owner's things.

28
00:01:05.066 --> 00:01:08.466
Once discovered, we won't be able to eat.
