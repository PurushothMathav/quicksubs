00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:05.000
Ha Dinh, what's going on?

2
00:00:06.733 --> 00:00:08.900
He used to be a repairman.

3
00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:10.766
Responsible for villa maintenance

4
00:00:10.766 --> 00:00:13.433
Being able to unlock this is normal.

5
00:00:13.666 --> 00:00:15.000
I say go.

6
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.866
I almost let this bitch deceive me.

7
00:00:16.866 --> 00:00:18.700
I thought this villa belonged to you.

8
00:00:18.733 --> 00:00:20.333
I'll call the property later.

9
00:00:20.333 --> 00:00:21.766
Ask him to cancel your permission.

10
00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:35.000
This house looks like a castle.

11
00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:36.833
It takes a lot of money.

12
00:00:37.366 --> 00:00:39.600
Oh, it's okay.

13
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:40.566
One hundred million.

14
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.333
One hundred million one hundred million

15
00:00:43.333 --> 00:00:45.266
Even the red wine next door cannot be bought.

16
00:00:45.366 --> 00:00:47.066
Are not. Why are you still here?

17
00:00:47.066 --> 00:00:48.866
Do you owe me as a down payment?

18
00:00:48.866 --> 00:00:51.900
I wonder how much it will cost to renovate this villa?

19
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:54.000
That's right, our living room.

20
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.600
Just want to lie low.

21
00:01:01.133 --> 00:01:03.100
Red wine worth more than 100 million

22
00:01:03.133 --> 00:01:05.166
I have never touched it in my life.

23
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.666
Cortin, turn on the lights.

24
00:01:07.666 --> 00:01:10.866
Today let's open a bottle of red wine to celebrate.

25
00:01:11.066 --> 00:01:11.966
Okay.

26
00:01:19.933 --> 00:01:20.833
Star?

27
00:01:21.566 --> 00:01:22.600
When you buy a house

28
00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.466
The manager wouldn't let him see the house.

29
00:01:24.733 --> 00:01:26.700
Access control cannot find a place to live.

30
00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.500
I also don't know where to turn the light on.

31
00:01:29.266 --> 00:01:32.100
I've just been here too long. I'll find it right away.

32
00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.966
Okay, okay, stop looking.

33
00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.100
Hello ice, honey.

34
00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.666
Turn on the light.
