00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:02.933
Still my little battery, hurry up.

2
00:00:02.933 --> 00:00:05.100
There is my unique navigation and positioning system

3
00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:06.466
Drive without traffic jams

4
00:00:06.533 --> 00:00:09.433
If you look inside and live here, aren't you still stuck on the road?

5
00:00:09.733 --> 00:00:11.133
Hurry up.

6
00:00:11.133 --> 00:00:12.600
I've already set up the navigation.

7
00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:14.900
Good.

8
00:00:17.866 --> 00:00:19.700
Hey, what are you doing?

9
00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:20.800
Know this place?

10
00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.466
Ah dare to rush in

11
00:00:22.533 --> 00:00:25.300
You know, the Hamada Group's signed order will not?

12
00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:26.666
We came here for dinner.

13
00:00:27.533 --> 00:00:32.033
Do you guys have an invitation?

14
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.800
It's OK. I don't need an invitation.

15
00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:42.833
You can come in.

16
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.100
There's no invitation, what are you guys doing here?

17
00:00:45.133 --> 00:00:48.133
A person riding a battery-powered vehicle wears himself like a child

18
00:00:48.133 --> 00:00:51.000
You're not even qualified to come in and carry a plate.

19
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.300
Go away!

20
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:53.700
How does Ray work?

21
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.166
Haven't trained you guys yet?

22
00:00:55.166 --> 00:00:57.233
I am the host of this party.

23
00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:58.933
Who gave you the courage?

24
00:00:58.933 --> 00:01:00.566
Dare to impersonate payment in advance

25
00:01:00.566 --> 00:01:02.500
Start the meeting directly in Rett's name

26
00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.200
Go away quickly, you've offended a big person in here.

27
00:01:05.266 --> 00:01:07.200
You don't even know how to die.

28
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:18.800
This.

29
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.666
Look at that girl's dress.

30
00:01:23.133 --> 00:01:24.566
I saw it on the news.

31
00:01:24.566 --> 00:01:26.700
That is famous designer Diana.

32
00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.900
The lonely product is specifically designed for our down payment

33
00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:30.400
There is only this in the world.

34
00:01:31.066 --> 00:01:31.866
And...

35
00:01:31.866 --> 00:01:33.800
I heard that Rett said he had just contacted Australia a few days ago.

36
00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:34.700
Air freight has arrived.

37
00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.500
Then isn't that our great lady?

38
00:01:38.166 --> 00:01:39.300
I'm back, ma'am.

39
00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.266
Again, because we are clowns.
