00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:03.633
Why did grandpa apologize to me?

2
00:00:03.933 --> 00:00:06.466
Is it challenging my work attitude?

3
00:00:06.566 --> 00:00:10.000
Hey, hey, if anywhere is what I should do.

4
00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:12.700
I just don't know if the person in charge of arrangements is still satisfied today.

5
00:00:12.933 --> 00:00:14.800
Ask me if I'm satisfied

6
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.200
Isn't the object of his service the protection of heaven and earth?

7
00:00:17.666 --> 00:00:19.300
Could it be arranged today?

8
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.266
It's him who sold my face.

9
00:00:21.266 --> 00:00:23.600
Especially coordinated with a play by Uncle Lam.

10
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:26.833
I couldn't hear anything clearly.

11
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.166
This is the black card of my rich family.

12
00:00:31.166 --> 00:00:32.200
The amount is over 100 million

13
00:00:33.866 --> 00:00:36.100
Hope Rett doesn't give up.

14
00:00:38.533 --> 00:00:40.233
The vice president is also too polite.

15
00:00:40.566 --> 00:00:42.300
What the young lady said was indeed correct.

16
00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.400
She also likes acting.

17
00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.066
Look at my marriage.

18
00:00:48.933 --> 00:00:51.400
I said Uncle Lam was the delivery person.

19
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:52.866
How dare you impersonate me?

20
00:00:53.333 --> 00:00:55.866
It turns out that breaking the pot and selling iron would help me.

21
00:00:55.866 --> 00:00:57.366
Let him help put on a play.

22
00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:00.233
He is still so familiar with him in my daily life.

23
00:01:00.466 --> 00:01:01.966
I'll call and tell my dad.

24
00:01:01.966 --> 00:01:03.233
Tell my dad to fire him.

25
00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:07.400
Wrong about you.

26
00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:08.466
Sorry.

27
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.866
I don't blame you.

28
00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.466
I thought...

29
00:01:12.466 --> 00:01:14.933
There will be people who like to hide my identity.

30
00:01:14.933 --> 00:01:16.566
But not now.

31
00:01:16.933 --> 00:01:18.766
I still go back to restoring my identity.

32
00:01:19.066 --> 00:01:20.766
Accept your age well.

33
00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.133
That's not the idea either, I'll bring it to you.

34
00:01:23.133 --> 00:01:25.433
Okay, so you go.
