00:00:00.566 --> 00:00:01.366
So...

2
00:00:02.533 --> 00:00:04.500
How can I go?

3
00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:06.233
What's going on?

4
00:00:07.466 --> 00:00:08.400
It's not wrong to say.

5
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:09.200
You.

6
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:10.666
Isn't this a flower?

7
00:00:10.666 --> 00:00:12.633
How does this bitch know about the safe?

8
00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:15.100
Isn't he a repairman?

9
00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:17.300
So he must have secretly watched me prepare.

10
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:19.666
Is that true?

11
00:00:19.666 --> 00:00:21.000
So let you give up completely.

12
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.766
So now let's talk a little.

13
00:00:22.766 --> 00:00:23.900
What's in the safe?

14
00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:25.466
You say it first.

15
00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.800
Inside.

16
00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.233
It was one of the wedding gifts I gave my husband.

17
00:00:29.333 --> 00:00:30.600
That's right.

18
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.866
That's the ring I prepared for Thien Nhi.

19
00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:34.000
He is very confident.

20
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.533
You must have known about insurance for a long time.

21
00:00:35.533 --> 00:00:36.566
What's in the cupboard?

22
00:00:36.566 --> 00:00:38.166
Following what he said will definitely not go wrong.

23
00:00:38.166 --> 00:00:39.700
You are so shameless.

24
00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:41.966
It's OK. I knew you would say that.

25
00:00:41.966 --> 00:00:43.700
Because this is what you have prepared

26
00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:45.666
Those safes are also for you to open.

27
00:00:46.333 --> 00:00:48.033
Go, husband.

28
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.766
How do I know your mother?

29
00:00:58.266 --> 00:00:59.000
What's up?

30
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.400
The password you set yourself will not be forgotten.

31
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:05.633
The only explanation is that this house is not yours.
