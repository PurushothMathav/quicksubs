00:00:01.666 --> 00:00:04.266
Can make the eyes higher than the top.

2
00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:06.566
Served with such respect.

3
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.066
Could he really be a down payment?

4
00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:11.066
Miss.

5
00:00:11.366 --> 00:00:13.566
Um, if you call me if there's anything, I'll go first.

6
00:00:13.566 --> 00:00:14.966
YES.

7
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.400
My husband likes to be called vice president.

8
00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:19.866
We will call him vice president later.

9
00:00:20.066 --> 00:00:21.000
Let it go.

10
00:00:21.133 --> 00:00:23.100
Is the vice president of the great lady.

11
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.366
Then I will go first.

12
00:00:27.966 --> 00:00:29.166
General Gu went to the bathroom

13
00:00:32.933 --> 00:00:34.033
Oh my.

14
00:00:34.933 --> 00:00:37.833
Oh, don't touch me.

15
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.700
At first I thought you were the real Miss Minh Nguyet.

16
00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.800
I just agreed to let you date my son.

17
00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.000
But I didn't expect you to be a fake.

18
00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.600
Uncle Le is the real great lady.

19
00:00:48.933 --> 00:00:51.866
Oh, I'm blind.

20
00:00:51.866 --> 00:00:54.200
I'm for this chicken of yours.

21
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.166
I chased the phoenix away.

22
00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.000
Ke Ting Ke Ting, please tell me something.

23
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.566
We are already engaged. Who got engaged to you?

24
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.466
Your cheating marriage is not valid.

25
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.566
Son, quickly go find Uncle Lam.

26
00:01:09.566 --> 00:01:11.133
He was dead at first.

27
00:01:11.133 --> 00:01:12.500
Stick with you for three years

28
00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.366
Hook your finger again and he'll come back.

29
00:01:15.366 --> 00:01:16.600
I'll be right over.

30
00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.800
Don't go, two coins are lost, hurry up.

31
00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:20.600
Can stop

32
00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:22.566
Uncle.

33
00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:24.000
Are not.

34
00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.466
That's good.

35
00:01:29.666 --> 00:01:31.466
But I have done a lot for you.

36
00:01:31.466 --> 00:01:33.033
You cannot abandon me.

37
00:01:36.766 --> 00:01:39.500
Hey, benefactor, there's a little more work today.

38
00:01:40.533 --> 00:01:41.333
HAS.
