00:00:00.466 --> 00:00:03.000
You won't feel like taking out a black card arbitrarily.

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.266
Can you pretend to be the richest person in Long Xuyen?

3
00:00:05.266 --> 00:00:07.733
This supreme black card is exclusive to Fuji.

4
00:00:07.733 --> 00:00:09.166
Heir to the corporation

5
00:00:09.166 --> 00:00:11.300
The new deputy general director has the right to retain.

6
00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:14.300
Only your little white face is fake.

7
00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:16.100
Who are you talking about?

8
00:00:17.933 --> 00:00:18.733
What's going on?

9
00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:21.600
Store manager, there's a poor guy here who's full of fakes.

10
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.600
Holding a fake card and wanting to come to our store to commit fraud.

11
00:00:24.866 --> 00:00:25.666
OH.

12
00:00:29.166 --> 00:00:29.966
This.

13
00:00:29.966 --> 00:00:32.700
This is the only one issued by the rural bank.

14
00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:33.766
Supreme black card

15
00:00:33.766 --> 00:00:36.366
I was lucky enough to see his design.

16
00:00:36.366 --> 00:00:37.600
It's like this.

17
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.500
He is actually the vice president of Fuji Corporation.

18
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:42.900
How is that possible?

19
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.100
Only two poor people dressed like that.

20
00:00:45.766 --> 00:00:48.600
Shut up.

21
00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:50.700
This makes you offend adults.

22
00:00:51.266 --> 00:00:52.166
Mayor

23
00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:55.100
Our store is not allowed to choose the same goods as you.

24
00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:56.566
Pack your things and go on your own.

25
00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:04.066
Hey, hey, are you disappointed when the deputy general director comes here?

26
00:01:04.166 --> 00:01:05.300
Hello, Madam Vice President.

27
00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:08.500
These things are in our store, you can look at them and choose them at your leisure.

28
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:09.433
Okay.

29
00:01:10.133 --> 00:01:11.166
Stand up.

30
00:01:12.533 --> 00:01:14.800
Oh, I'm lucky to meet my parents today.

31
00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.366
Man, it's brilliant.

32
00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.300
This card really does that.

33
00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.466
perfunctory you are very capable, right?

34
00:01:27.533 --> 00:01:29.666
Take the clothes and bags he just touched.

35
00:01:29.733 --> 00:01:30.733
Take it all out for me.

36
00:01:30.733 --> 00:01:31.766
I bought them all.

37
00:01:31.933 --> 00:01:33.433
Hey, okay.

38
00:01:33.566 --> 00:01:36.366
The Vice President really loves Mrs. Haha

39
00:01:36.366 --> 00:01:38.666
No, there's no need for that many dresses.

40
00:01:38.666 --> 00:01:41.200
So I'll customize this for you.

41
00:01:43.666 --> 00:01:45.866
Don't women just like beautiful clothes?

42
00:01:45.866 --> 00:01:47.233
Choose arbitrarily, choose arbitrarily

43
00:01:47.966 --> 00:01:49.266
The old woman lost her memory

44
00:01:49.266 --> 00:01:51.600
There's no dress he's wearing here.

45
00:01:52.166 --> 00:01:54.266
Or use the dress I ordered instead.

46
00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:55.966
A few days ago.

47
00:01:55.966 --> 00:01:57.766
Elf fabric is shipped by air from Australia

48
00:01:57.766 --> 00:02:00.766
How do you know that?
