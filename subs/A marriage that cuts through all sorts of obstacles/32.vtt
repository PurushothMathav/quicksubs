00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:02.433
You are the one who pays for this cup first.

2
00:00:02.566 --> 00:00:04.500
Because this matter has been owed for a long time.

3
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:05.900
Why do you owe me?

4
00:00:07.466 --> 00:00:09.700
Now call Bang Dien Group.

5
00:00:09.766 --> 00:00:10.866
Tell them to send someone to you.

6
00:00:10.866 --> 00:00:12.066
Whatever they hit, they chase it away.

7
00:00:12.066 --> 00:00:14.466
Okay, you guys call Bang Dien Group immediately.

8
00:00:14.466 --> 00:00:16.566
I'll see how long you can react.

9
00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.600
How dare I call Bang Dien Group?

10
00:00:19.666 --> 00:00:21.700
Isn't that something that has been debunked?

11
00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:23.866
I'd better quickly retreat. It's OK.

12
00:00:23.866 --> 00:00:25.666
Afraid of what?

13
00:00:26.733 --> 00:00:28.100
Being such a husband.

14
00:00:28.266 --> 00:00:30.600
I promised my dad.

15
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.700
In front of my future husband.

16
00:00:32.733 --> 00:00:34.233
Your previous identity

17
00:00:34.266 --> 00:00:35.933
If I call him now

18
00:00:35.933 --> 00:00:37.300
Doesn't he know that I'm violent in front of you?

19
00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:38.433
Have you revealed your identity yet?

20
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.266
If he thinks you're after my money

21
00:00:41.266 --> 00:00:43.666
How can we get married?

22
00:00:44.133 --> 00:00:45.100
That makes sense.

23
00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:47.766
Was I just a little angry?

24
00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.600
Great, it's all energy again.

25
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.233
Your complete art of tea

26
00:00:53.866 --> 00:00:54.900
Impossible.

27
00:00:55.866 --> 00:00:56.666
Howl.

28
00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.100
I'm not in the mood to talk nonsense with you.

29
00:01:03.966 --> 00:01:05.766
I have sent a message to Bang Dien.

30
00:01:05.766 --> 00:01:07.266
Group of lawyers of the corporation.

31
00:01:07.266 --> 00:01:09.300
Just wait for the lawyer's letter.

32
00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:10.433
Let's go.

33
00:01:10.966 --> 00:01:13.066
Don't run, don't chase anymore.

34
00:01:13.133 --> 00:01:14.900
Into such deep drama.

35
00:01:15.133 --> 00:01:17.900
Um, compensation pending payment in advance actually.

36
00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:18.900
Just leave it alone.

37
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.466
Okay, send the surveillance video to Rett.

38
00:01:21.466 --> 00:01:23.100
Leave the rest to him.

39
00:01:23.333 --> 00:01:26.300
Then prepare a large gift to pay in advance.

40
00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.200
Send it to him after signing the order

41
00:01:29.733 --> 00:01:32.000
It seems like these times have been compensated.

42
00:01:32.266 --> 00:01:34.300
I've told you many times.

43
00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:35.666
I just don't hold hands.

44
00:01:35.666 --> 00:01:37.866
If you don't believe it, don't hate his thousand words.

45
00:01:37.866 --> 00:01:39.466
You come here, I will prove it to you.
