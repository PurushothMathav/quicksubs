00:00:00.533 --> 00:00:01.833
Hey boss.

2
00:00:02.766 --> 00:00:05.300
What, our store has been bought?

3
00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:06.766
Now the name has changed.

4
00:00:07.966 --> 00:00:10.100
Hey, okay, okay.

5
00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:11.300
I know, boss.

6
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.033
Who is our new boss?

7
00:00:15.133 --> 00:00:18.600
Oh, it must be paid in advance for you.

8
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.166
This is just a high quality store.

9
00:00:20.166 --> 00:00:22.066
It won't be just one sentence.

10
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:22.766
Manager

11
00:00:22.766 --> 00:00:24.766
If you don't, quickly bring that skirt and hit me in the mouth.

12
00:00:24.766 --> 00:00:26.466
Are you the store manager or am I the store manager?

13
00:00:26.666 --> 00:00:27.766
This dog hammer.

14
00:00:28.133 --> 00:00:29.000
Haha.

15
00:00:29.566 --> 00:00:31.300
I am the new owner of this store.

16
00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:32.566
These vestments are also mine.

17
00:00:32.566 --> 00:00:33.366
Where are you going?

18
00:00:33.366 --> 00:00:34.166
Forget it.

19
00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:37.966
This dress my grandmother ordered for you is also stubborn.

20
00:00:38.366 --> 00:00:40.466
If he wants it, give it to him.

21
00:00:41.966 --> 00:00:43.366
This man is not helping you.

22
00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.366
Don't argue with him until I investigate clearly.

23
00:00:46.366 --> 00:00:47.166
Good.

24
00:00:48.266 --> 00:00:50.666
Why can't I pretend anymore?

25
00:00:50.666 --> 00:00:52.200
You say is it here?

26
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.966
Why do you two have to humiliate yourself?

27
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:55.666
Just look at the dress.

28
00:00:55.666 --> 00:00:56.933
If you don't need it, you don't need it anymore.

29
00:00:56.933 --> 00:00:59.100
But this tone was unbearable.

30
00:01:01.933 --> 00:01:02.866
Let's go!

31
00:01:02.866 --> 00:01:04.900
This mean woman is going to ruin my dress.
