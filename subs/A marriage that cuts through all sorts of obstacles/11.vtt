00:00:02.266 --> 00:00:04.066
You think you helped the rich lady, right?

2
00:00:04.066 --> 00:00:05.966
Protect me like that tells you

3
00:00:05.966 --> 00:00:08.733
It's just that the elevator is broken.

4
00:00:08.733 --> 00:00:09.866
That's why I remember the topic

5
00:00:09.866 --> 00:00:11.033
Fake big lady

6
00:00:12.666 --> 00:00:14.600
Sorry.

7
00:00:15.933 --> 00:00:17.100
So I just released it

8
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.500
Is to exchange new repair parts for you to repair.

9
00:00:20.066 --> 00:00:21.000
Look.

10
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.366
Still have to find a chance to warn him.

11
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.700
After that, brag less.

12
00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:27.900
This kind of luck doesn't come every time.

13
00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:30.966
The two of you are still pretending at this time.

14
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:32.166
Two people.

15
00:00:32.333 --> 00:00:33.466
Take them both.

16
00:00:33.466 --> 00:00:34.400
Sent in front of Rett.

17
00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.166
I'll let Rett take a closer look.

18
00:00:36.166 --> 00:00:38.366
In the end, is she really the eldest lady?

19
00:00:38.366 --> 00:00:39.900
Make me kneel.

20
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.433
This time I will let you kneel in front of me so I can kowtow.

21
00:00:42.533 --> 00:00:45.966
I, the head of Fuji Long Xuyen Group, Pho Ngan Nien, am here.

22
00:00:46.133 --> 00:00:47.800
Let's see who dares to take action

23
00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:50.800
You.

24
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.466
Who dares to barge into Long Xuyen Hotel again?

25
00:00:55.566 --> 00:00:57.366
Aren't you afraid of being offended by paying in advance?

26
00:00:57.566 --> 00:00:58.733
Full of fate?

27
00:00:58.733 --> 00:01:01.300
The head of four Long Xuyen families

28
00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.000
Family secretary

29
00:01:05.533 --> 00:01:06.566
Black dragon tattoo

30
00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.300
This is a sign of additional force.

31
00:01:09.166 --> 00:01:10.833
Are you really family members?

32
00:01:11.166 --> 00:01:13.066
I don't understand who's coming anymore.

33
00:01:13.266 --> 00:01:15.066
Did he really not lie?
