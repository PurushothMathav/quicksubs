00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:02.466
What is the origin of this dress?

2
00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:03.900
A few days ago.

3
00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:07.100
Wright made a special reservation for the down payment.

4
00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:08.966
Australia is high and determined one

5
00:00:08.966 --> 00:00:10.700
Except me and Rett.

6
00:00:10.766 --> 00:00:12.800
No one knows in our store.

7
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.666
That's strange, you say how did you know this news?

8
00:00:18.533 --> 00:00:20.400
Then you are...

9
00:00:21.666 --> 00:00:23.866
That's right, I'm the one paying in advance.

10
00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.700
Miss, you said so.

11
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:28.266
I'm here to pull your face.

12
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.666
Ha ha, okay, stop causing trouble.

13
00:00:31.866 --> 00:00:34.133
I did not do anything. Definitely mine.

14
00:00:34.133 --> 00:00:35.366
I am the down payment.

15
00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.200
I'm here.

16
00:00:37.366 --> 00:00:40.300
Why me before?

17
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.533
I will buy you beautiful high-end clothes.

18
00:00:42.533 --> 00:00:43.866
Calm down, okay?

19
00:00:45.366 --> 00:00:47.666
Hey, it's those two dead scammers again.

20
00:00:48.133 --> 00:00:50.066
Fraud scam

21
00:00:50.133 --> 00:00:52.200
Do you know them?

22
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.766
They held a black card saying they were Deputy General Director.

23
00:00:54.766 --> 00:00:56.100
What?

24
00:00:56.333 --> 00:00:57.600
Two people.

25
00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.700
I also don't know if Diem Diem's ​​cut is real or fake.

26
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:02.400
Both are repeat offenders.

27
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:03.400
Actual director

28
00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:04.500
Great acting

29
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.400
Last time, he pretended to be me at my villa.

30
00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.566
It's just his whole body sold on the ground.

31
00:01:14.566 --> 00:01:15.800
Not more than 200 yuan.

32
00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.400
I still have to pay thousands of money in advance.

33
00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.100
It's obvious that you're impersonating us everywhere.

34
00:01:19.166 --> 00:01:21.800
Okay, you two don't know whether to live or die.

35
00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.833
Really cheated out of prepayment.

36
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.366
If the diamond has scratches on it

37
00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.966
A lifetime cannot be compensated.

38
00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.033
Cortin, I want this dress.
