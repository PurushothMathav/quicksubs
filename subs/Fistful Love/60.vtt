00:00:00.233 --> 00:00:02.900
Where is he? Do you really want to know?

2
00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:04.933
If you don't say it again, I'll call someone.

3
00:00:04.933 --> 00:00:07.666
Only your mother can beat me in the whole boxing gym

4
00:00:07.666 --> 00:00:10.533
Do you want your mother to come and fight me?

5
00:00:10.533 --> 00:00:11.733
What do you want?

6
00:00:11.733 --> 00:00:14.433
I did something wrong in the ballroom last time.

7
00:00:14.433 --> 00:00:16.000
I want you to forgive me.

8
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.800
If you don't forgive, the result is the same.

9
00:00:19.066 --> 00:00:21.400
Please give me a chance to shut up

10
00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:22.633
I don't call law enforcement right now

11
00:00:22.633 --> 00:00:23.966
It is also the greatest face for you.

12
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:28.000
Please send me your soul as soon as possible, so I can go.

13
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:31.900
This is my last chance.

14
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.700
In the future, since you are still willing to come with me

15
00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.633
Then don't blame me for being ruthless

16
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.733
Sir, the news is breaking on the Internet now

17
00:00:40.733 --> 00:00:41.300
Lin Wenli did not

18
00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.733
You can play normally if you take stimulants.

19
00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:45.700
If we don't let him show up

20
00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:47.633
In case law enforcement investigates

21
00:00:47.633 --> 00:00:49.900
Kingdom Japanese and French dramas are very powerful

22
00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.100
We should really be careful

23
00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.333
So what do we do?

24
00:00:53.333 --> 00:00:56.000
Can let you go for this game

25
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.733
Then let him compete with the Yang family

26
00:00:58.733 --> 00:01:00.300
Must fight to the death

27
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.400
We're going to make this an underground game.

28
00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:04.600
The hottest

29
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.800
video program

30
00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.800
It's sure to be a huge success on the web

31
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.100
Sir, what you say makes perfect sense.

32
00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:11.733
But

33
00:01:11.733 --> 00:01:14.400
If we let Lin Wenli go to a UFC game

34
00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.466
Don't you let the cooked duck fly away?

35
00:01:16.466 --> 00:01:18.533
Didn't you hear Qingfeng say it?

36
00:01:18.533 --> 00:01:20.200
For Lin Wenli

37
00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:21.700
What's the most important thing?

38
00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.566
Is his biological mother
