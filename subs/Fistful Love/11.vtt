00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:06.900
Sister, do you still remember 18 years ago?

2
00:00:08.733 --> 00:00:10.300
Miss Yan is a little princess

3
00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:12.033
I still have three moles on my arm

4
00:00:12.033 --> 00:00:13.833
Your Tianjin is very healthy.

5
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:15.900
When the good boy comes down

6
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.333
The nurse said the child is healthy

7
00:00:17.333 --> 00:00:19.900
Why did you suddenly have epilepsy after a night?

8
00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:21.300
It's not cured now

9
00:00:21.433 --> 00:00:23.833
Maybe I didn't notice it when the baby was born.

10
00:00:23.833 --> 00:00:26.533
How do you explain the three red moles on your arm?

11
00:00:26.533 --> 00:00:28.833
Why did it suddenly disappear after a night?

12
00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:30.866
I have already asked the nurse about this.

13
00:00:30.866 --> 00:00:33.066
They said the nurse might have been confused

14
00:00:33.066 --> 00:00:34.233
It's not actually red paper

15
00:00:34.233 --> 00:00:35.866
It's the blood of my birth

16
00:00:35.866 --> 00:00:38.100
Our family is a martial arts family

17
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.466
Although I have not practiced martial arts

18
00:00:39.466 --> 00:00:41.500
But I have some martial arts talent in me

19
00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:42.833
Not to mention you

20
00:00:42.833 --> 00:00:43.866
You are fighting in Dragon City

21
00:00:43.866 --> 00:00:45.400
King, look at scum

22
00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.633
His qualifications are not even as good as ordinary students

23
00:00:47.633 --> 00:00:48.866
How do you explain that?

24
00:00:48.866 --> 00:00:51.700
Zhiyuan, what do you mean?

25
00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:54.166
I suspect scum is not your biological daughter

26
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.533
Zhiyuan, you think too much.

27
00:00:56.533 --> 00:00:57.733
How is that possible?

28
00:00:57.733 --> 00:00:59.233
Technology is so advanced now

29
00:00:59.233 --> 00:01:00.833
You and scum take a paternity test

30
00:01:00.833 --> 00:01:01.966
Understand everything

31
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.833
Never mind.

32
00:01:03.433 --> 00:01:04.833
Zhiyuan, I think so

33
00:01:04.833 --> 00:01:06.400
You still think too much.

34
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.400
Scum, he must be my daughter

35
00:01:08.633 --> 00:01:10.066
Even if he is not qualified

36
00:01:10.066 --> 00:01:12.800
I'll just teach him more. You're his uncle

37
00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.533
Don't bring this up again

38
00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.500
Hey, Jiangnan, you finally woke up.

39
00:01:27.233 --> 00:01:29.500
Hey, why wait for me, you will go to Superman?

40
00:01:30.466 --> 00:01:31.100
I'll learn from you.

41
00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.900
You haven't seen me in Jiangnan for so many years next door.

42
00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.066
I don't know.

43
00:01:36.066 --> 00:01:37.800
I didn't teach superhuman rights

44
00:01:38.066 --> 00:01:39.966
In the entire Dragon City, only you can choose human rights

45
00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:41.066
He is a newcomer

46
00:01:41.066 --> 00:01:42.733
It's not what you teach, who else doesn't

47
00:01:42.733 --> 00:01:45.300
Scum I really don't know

48
00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:47.900
Maybe it's the texture

49
00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:48.700
Yes

50
00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.900
He has talent

51
00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:52.533
You like him, don't you? I have no talent at all

52
00:01:52.533 --> 00:01:53.733
I still have a father

53
00:01:53.933 --> 00:01:55.533
I don't deserve to be your daughter

54
00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:56.600
He's just better than me.

55
00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:57.966
Is he ready?
