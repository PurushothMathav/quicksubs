00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.100
I let go I won't go

2
00:00:03.466 --> 00:00:06.266
You let me in and I'll explain to the teacher

3
00:00:06.466 --> 00:00:08.533
You still want to be a fighting queen

4
00:00:08.533 --> 00:00:11.900
I'll give you a nickname, the Queen of Black Spring, hahaha.

5
00:00:12.133 --> 00:00:13.566
I beg you.

6
00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:14.600
Go away go away

7
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.300
The president said not to let you come again

8
00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:17.500
Why is your skin so thick?

9
00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.900
Brother Long Brother Long

10
00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:21.400
You are my brothers

11
00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.133
Can you guys help me out here?

12
00:00:24.133 --> 00:00:25.933
Please help me in.

13
00:00:25.933 --> 00:00:27.133
Sister Wen Li

14
00:00:27.133 --> 00:00:28.700
I think you look okay too

15
00:00:28.766 --> 00:00:31.400
Why don't you stay with us tonight?

16
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.166
How is it?

17
00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:35.266
Play a threesome with two dragons

18
00:00:35.266 --> 00:00:36.766
Take care of your brothers

19
00:00:36.766 --> 00:00:40.200
How about we make you look good at the teacher's place?

20
00:00:40.566 --> 00:00:42.966
Hmph, why don't you like Brother Tiger and Brother Long?

21
00:00:42.966 --> 00:00:44.766
Ignorant trash

22
00:00:44.766 --> 00:00:46.633
Go away

23
00:00:52.966 --> 00:00:56.133
Uncle Yan's market cleaning pot is like this

24
00:00:56.133 --> 00:00:58.066
I know the teacher is very angry

25
00:00:58.066 --> 00:00:59.800
But I also had to

26
00:01:00.333 --> 00:01:01.866
Have you paid what you owe?

27
00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.366
They gave me three black punches

28
00:01:04.666 --> 00:01:06.966
I only played two games and it's not enough

29
00:01:07.933 --> 00:01:10.566
Go to the company account and transfer 5 million to the age

30
00:01:10.566 --> 00:01:11.500
1 million pay off debts

31
00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:12.900
The rest 4 million

32
00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.500
The most pocket money is don't be strict, uncle.

33
00:01:16.766 --> 00:01:18.466
You give me too much money.

34
00:01:18.466 --> 00:01:20.166
I can't afford you

35
00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.066
Wedding is what an uncle should do

36
00:01:23.066 --> 00:01:25.366
Uncle still thinks it's too little for you.

37
00:01:25.366 --> 00:01:27.133
You've suffered all these years

38
00:01:27.133 --> 00:01:29.300
Uncle Nian, what do you mean?

39
00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:32.300
You've always been so nice to me

40
00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:35.466
If you need anything in the future, just let your uncle say

41
00:01:35.466 --> 00:01:36.633
It's settled.

42
00:01:36.966 --> 00:01:37.966
Please check it out.

43
00:01:37.966 --> 00:01:39.266
That forced text

44
00:01:39.266 --> 00:01:42.433
Who is the mastermind behind the black boxing?

45
00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:45.500
teacher

46
00:01:46.166 --> 00:01:47.200
Why are you here?

47
00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.566
What are you doing with my uncle?
