00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:01.600
You ask

2
00:00:02.933 --> 00:00:05.333
Master asked you not to say that

3
00:00:05.333 --> 00:00:07.633
If you don't know what to say, I'll say it first

4
00:00:07.633 --> 00:00:11.233
Then you say it first. First of all, I want to say sorry to you.

5
00:00:13.366 --> 00:00:15.800
I'm sorry for taking away the life that should have belonged to you

6
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.000
But it's out of your control at all

7
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.500
I can't pay what I owe you before

8
00:00:19.533 --> 00:00:20.933
I will never take your place again

9
00:00:20.933 --> 00:00:22.000
I'll give you a shroud

10
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.933
Do you still play the game?

11
00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.966
No more fighting.

12
00:00:25.966 --> 00:00:28.333
I just found out the identity of the daughter who was pushed to the whole network.

13
00:00:28.333 --> 00:00:30.133
I'm nothing. Don't say that

14
00:00:30.133 --> 00:00:31.733
You are my most valuable opponent

15
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.533
But we ask a lot of prices every day

16
00:00:33.533 --> 00:00:36.400
Marriage is more important than talent, for that matter

17
00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.000
I think you are worse than me at all

18
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.200
Okay, stop talking

19
00:00:39.433 --> 00:00:40.833
I've decided. Really?

20
00:00:40.966 --> 00:00:43.500
What to do anyway

21
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.200
I hope you can attend the UFC on April 14th.

22
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.633
Fighting Championship Finals

23
00:00:47.633 --> 00:00:48.833
We are destined opponents

24
00:00:48.833 --> 00:00:51.166
This golden belt must be born among us

25
00:00:51.166 --> 00:00:52.133
Although I am an opponent

26
00:00:52.133 --> 00:00:53.700
But we can also be good friends

27
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.500
No matter what the matter says

28
00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.500
I hope you can participate in this competition

29
00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:58.333
But

30
00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:00.833
I don't want to see my mom disappointed.

31
00:01:00.833 --> 00:01:02.966
Mom has never been disappointed in you.

32
00:01:02.966 --> 00:01:04.366
She's just worried about you.

33
00:01:04.366 --> 00:01:05.500
I'm here this time

34
00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.566
I also came here for my mother to persuade you to go back

35
00:01:07.566 --> 00:01:09.300
Let's go back together and be mom's daughter

36
00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:10.333
Isn't that nice?

37
00:01:10.333 --> 00:01:11.366
Do you really think so?

38
00:01:11.366 --> 00:01:14.166
Really, I really think so.

39
00:01:14.166 --> 00:01:16.633
Come back with me to prepare for the game

40
00:01:16.633 --> 00:01:18.066
I decided to go somewhere.

41
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.133
I'll get it for you after I go.

42
00:01:21.333 --> 00:01:22.666
Then I'll go with you.
