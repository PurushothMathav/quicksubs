00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.266
Actually you are you are

2
00:00:02.733 --> 00:00:03.966
What's the matter, Uncle Ying?

3
00:00:11.066 --> 00:00:13.000
Teacher teacher

4
00:00:14.766 --> 00:00:15.466
current season

5
00:00:15.466 --> 00:00:17.166
The car accident has not been proven clear

6
00:00:17.166 --> 00:00:19.400
International law within me has always been treasured by others

7
00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.366
If this result is announced now

8
00:00:21.366 --> 00:00:23.833
Maybe it will bring them a bigger return.

9
00:00:24.166 --> 00:00:26.700
No, no one else should know about this

10
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:28.400
No one can touch my family

11
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.200
What happened to your uncle?

12
00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:31.300
Oh, it's okay.

13
00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:32.866
I just came to see you

14
00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:33.500
I see.

15
00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.966
You have no other relatives in this world

16
00:00:35.966 --> 00:00:38.866
You are destined for my sister and me

17
00:00:38.866 --> 00:00:41.166
You will treat me like your own uncle from now on

18
00:00:41.166 --> 00:00:43.000
Okay, really?

19
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:43.900
Good.

20
00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:46.266
You and your teacher are the most important people to me

21
00:00:46.266 --> 00:00:47.600
Who dares to bully you in the future?

22
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.166
Just tell me right away

23
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.366
Hello Zhiyuan

24
00:00:55.866 --> 00:00:57.700
DNA identification results

25
00:00:58.333 --> 00:00:59.500
Here we go.

26
00:01:00.866 --> 00:01:01.666
sister

27
00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.866
The appraisal results are out Wenli

28
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.966
Wen Li is not your biological daughter

29
00:01:08.366 --> 00:01:10.800
Oops, I just said

30
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:14.100
Scum must be my own daughter, don't you believe it

31
00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.766
Fortunately, I didn't tell Wenli about this.

32
00:01:16.766 --> 00:01:18.966
Otherwise, this will be a big misunderstanding.

33
00:01:18.966 --> 00:01:20.900
But liberal arts is indeed a good seedling

34
00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:21.666
Good personality

35
00:01:21.666 --> 00:01:23.700
You have to spend more time dying on him

36
00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.366
He won't let you down.

37
00:01:25.366 --> 00:01:26.700
I'm sure of that.

38
00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.133
He and scum are good kids

39
00:01:29.133 --> 00:01:31.866
I will definitely train them well

40
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.466
Just forget about it.

41
00:01:33.466 --> 00:01:34.566
Get well

42
00:01:34.566 --> 00:01:36.900
The company still has something to do, so I hung up first

43
00:01:41.166 --> 00:01:44.900
Why did you say that Wenli is not my child?

44
00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:47.966
My heart is empty
