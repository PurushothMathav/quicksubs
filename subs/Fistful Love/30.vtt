00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:02.633
No way. It's impossible.

2
00:00:02.633 --> 00:00:04.866
That's what the doctor said, why don't you ask him?

3
00:00:05.066 --> 00:00:06.866
Maybe I remember it wrong.

4
00:00:06.866 --> 00:00:08.933
Your brother-in-law passed away 18 years ago

5
00:00:08.933 --> 00:00:11.766
Maybe I got his blood mixed up

6
00:00:11.766 --> 00:00:13.333
Wen Li is blood type O

7
00:00:13.366 --> 00:00:17.066
Both of your blood are rejecting

8
00:00:17.233 --> 00:00:18.133
The doctor said

9
00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:20.866
There is a high probability that your two immediate family members

10
00:00:20.966 --> 00:00:23.366
You forget there were so many coincidences before

11
00:00:24.833 --> 00:00:27.266
Hey wait weird

12
00:00:30.066 --> 00:00:31.633
Maybe a little allergic

13
00:00:32.233 --> 00:00:34.033
How could this be?

14
00:00:34.033 --> 00:00:36.533
Now both of your schools are in the hospital

15
00:00:36.566 --> 00:00:38.700
Just do a paternity test and you'll understand

16
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.833
Hey, that's it.

17
00:00:42.533 --> 00:00:43.866
And I was right.

18
00:00:43.866 --> 00:00:45.433
Wen Li is my sister's daughter

19
00:00:45.933 --> 00:00:47.366
I am her uncle

20
00:00:47.733 --> 00:00:49.800
I have to tell Wen Li this quickly

21
00:00:51.833 --> 00:00:53.066
Uncle Yan

22
00:00:56.266 --> 00:00:57.700
He kept calling me an uncle

23
00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:59.633
I should change my name to uncle

24
00:00:59.733 --> 00:01:02.233
How are you feeling about the wedding now?

25
00:01:02.233 --> 00:01:03.233
Are you still dizzy?

26
00:01:03.233 --> 00:01:04.500
I'm much better.

27
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:05.366
What about Teacher Yan?

28
00:01:05.366 --> 00:01:07.933
He's awake. He's not seriously injured.

29
00:01:07.933 --> 00:01:10.900
But it's still useless for you to write it now.

30
00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:12.966
He is very grateful for your kindness

31
00:01:13.033 --> 00:01:17.000
Uncle Yan, these are the management I should do

32
00:01:17.566 --> 00:01:18.866
Actually you are

33
00:01:19.266 --> 00:01:20.166
You are

34
00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.166
What's wrong with you, Uncle Yan?
