00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:02.033
Even an impostor dares to call Uncle Yan

2
00:00:02.166 --> 00:00:03.366
I am the fighting queen

3
00:00:03.366 --> 00:00:05.166
Yan Ziqi's Queen Yan Family Daughter

4
00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:06.566
Who are you?

5
00:00:06.566 --> 00:00:07.733
Can pretend to be me

6
00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:11.900
Who are you?

7
00:00:12.033 --> 00:00:13.866
How dare you pretend to be Miss Yan?

8
00:00:13.866 --> 00:00:16.466
It depends on what you wear.

9
00:00:16.466 --> 00:00:18.766
I think you are impersonating Miss Yan

10
00:00:18.766 --> 00:00:20.333
What a shit pit

11
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.366
Impersonating filial piety

12
00:00:22.366 --> 00:00:23.366
Oh, dear.

13
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:24.433
Ouch.

14
00:00:24.433 --> 00:00:27.833
It hurts to death you little bitch you little bitch

15
00:00:27.966 --> 00:00:29.300
How dare you hit my brother?

16
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:30.766
Let's do it together

17
00:00:31.133 --> 00:00:32.833
This little bitch's clothes

18
00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:34.900
Give me light one by one

19
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.266
A bunch of incompetent people

20
00:00:36.266 --> 00:00:36.633
It seems

21
00:00:36.633 --> 00:00:38.966
It's time for me to clean up for my mom

22
00:00:38.966 --> 00:00:40.166
Stop it all

23
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.466
Hey shut up

24
00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.833
How dare the eldest lady bully?

25
00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.966
Miss, you are really Miss

26
00:00:49.966 --> 00:00:51.133
That can be fake

27
00:00:52.766 --> 00:00:55.433
Miss, you are finally back home

28
00:00:55.433 --> 00:00:57.600
I haven't seen Coach Liu for three years

29
00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:58.833
Why did I come back?

30
00:00:58.833 --> 00:01:00.666
Someone is pretending to be me?

31
00:01:00.666 --> 00:01:03.400
Who told me to have the guts?

32
00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:05.700
It was him who pretended to be a little bitch

33
00:01:06.166 --> 00:01:07.000
I didn't take revenge

34
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.133
Miss, my name is Lin Wenli

35
00:01:09.166 --> 00:01:10.333
To learn to fight

36
00:01:10.333 --> 00:01:11.733
Coach Liu, let's fight

37
00:01:11.733 --> 00:01:13.566
Have all the local buns started to be collected?

38
00:01:13.566 --> 00:01:16.666
We are the leading fighting gym in Dragon City

39
00:01:16.666 --> 00:01:17.766
Can you come?

40
00:01:17.766 --> 00:01:19.833
You actually pretended to be the eldest lady

41
00:01:19.833 --> 00:01:21.866
I see you don't want to mix it up.

42
00:01:21.866 --> 00:01:25.133
People like this don't deserve to be with me

43
00:01:25.133 --> 00:01:26.133
Drive him away

44
00:01:26.133 --> 00:01:29.366
What a mouse shit that broke and burned me

45
00:01:29.366 --> 00:01:30.566
Teacher Yan called me here

46
00:01:30.566 --> 00:01:31.800
What's wrong with my mom?

47
00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.166
Everyone stays here

48
00:01:33.366 --> 00:01:36.433
Lin Wenli, even if Teacher Yan asked you to come

49
00:01:36.433 --> 00:01:39.433
But you broke the rules of the international pavilion

50
00:01:39.433 --> 00:01:40.833
Get out of here

51
00:01:40.933 --> 00:01:42.300
Yeah fuck off

52
00:01:43.266 --> 00:01:44.900
Just deceived us

53
00:01:44.933 --> 00:01:47.766
Now is the time to let him crawl out

54
00:01:47.766 --> 00:01:49.366
I'll say it again.

55
00:01:49.533 --> 00:01:52.266
I never said I was Miss Yan

56
00:01:52.766 --> 00:01:55.600
It's you who admit mistakes one by one and reverse black and white

57
00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:56.633
Such an international pavilion

58
00:01:57.233 --> 00:01:58.300
I shouldn't hide

59
00:02:01.333 --> 00:02:03.333
Hey, just go

60
00:02:03.333 --> 00:02:05.133
It's not that easy
