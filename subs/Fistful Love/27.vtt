Doctor, you must save my sister

10
00:00:26.033 --> 00:00:27.566
Don't worry, please wait outside.

11
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.766
How could there be a car accident suddenly?

12
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:33.366
I don't know.

13
00:00:33.366 --> 00:00:35.366
The car was going too fast.

14
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:36.800
I didn't see it clearly either.

15
00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:37.966
You go and arrange it.

16
00:00:37.966 --> 00:00:40.400
Be sure to find confirmation that the vehicle is

17
00:00:43.166 --> 00:00:44.900
Senior, what about my mother?

18
00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:46.133
How is my mom?

19
00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:47.766
Surgery has been scheduled

20
00:00:48.033 --> 00:00:48.866
Yan Jianan

21
00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:51.566
Teacher, he will be fine for sure.

22
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:52.800
Sure it's alright

23
00:00:53.066 --> 00:00:54.700
Li Wen, you are a disaster

24
00:00:54.766 --> 00:00:55.566
Since you came

25
00:00:55.566 --> 00:00:57.033
Does Boqi Hall have a day of peace?

26
00:00:57.033 --> 00:00:59.166
Are you still pretending to be a good person?

27
00:00:59.166 --> 00:01:02.400
The soul is powerful, the soul is you, you still have the face to stand here

28
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.300
Sorry, it's all my fault.

29
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.233
It's because I didn't protect you well

30
00:01:07.233 --> 00:01:08.600
You are a piece of crap

31
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.700
What are you capable of protecting my mother?

32
00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.000
If it weren't for my mother, you would have been sleeping on the street

33
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.566
What the hell are you talking about now?

34
00:01:14.566 --> 00:01:15.900
Ok stop arguing

35
00:01:16.633 --> 00:01:18.266
Your mom is getting ready for surgery now

36
00:01:18.266 --> 00:01:21.033
Lin Wenli, if my mother were a little bit long and short

37
00:01:21.033 --> 00:01:22.133
I want your life!

38
00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:24.066
I thought I would let you go

39
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.633
Someone else has lost too much blood and needs a blood transfusion

40
00:01:26.633 --> 00:01:28.100
But now the blood bank is running low

41
00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:29.366
Come with me for a blood test

42
00:01:29.366 --> 00:01:30.700
See who can write for the patient

43
00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.400
Doctor, this is my blood

44
00:01:32.466 --> 00:01:33.500
I am his daughter

45
00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:34.700
Please save my mom
