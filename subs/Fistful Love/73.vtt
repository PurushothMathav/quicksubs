1
00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.100
So you are my mother

2
00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:04.666
That's right, mom.

3
00:00:04.933 --> 00:00:07.100
Don't you forget that.

4
00:00:07.733 --> 00:00:08.000
you

5
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.100
Do you know how hard it has been for me to find you all these years?

6
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:13.366
My son!

7
00:00:13.366 --> 00:00:15.400
I miss you so much!

8
00:00:23.166 --> 00:00:24.000
Mom

9
00:00:24.966 --> 00:00:26.600
Mom thought

10
00:00:27.033 --> 00:00:30.100
My mom has been absent from you for so long

11
00:00:30.966 --> 00:00:33.533
Mom feels sorry for you

12
00:00:33.533 --> 00:00:36.700
No, actually, my adoptive mother was pretty good to me

13
00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.100
It's just that in the days before I paid her debt

14
00:00:43.433 --> 00:00:45.200
You're on.

15
00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:48.300
sister

16
00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:53.200
The child has been discharged from the hospital in the past two days, and he is covered in injuries.

17
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:54.166
What to run around

18
00:00:54.166 --> 00:00:55.700
Is that possible?

19
00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:57.300
Scum already knows where he's from

20
00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.366
I don't think so either.

21
00:00:58.366 --> 00:01:01.500
I guess he couldn't accept it for a while and left first

22
00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.400
What should we do now?

23
00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:04.900
Mom

24
00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:05.433
or

25
00:01:05.433 --> 00:01:08.166
You find a chance to sit down with him and have a good talk

26
00:01:08.166 --> 00:01:09.400
Good boy

27
00:01:10.733 --> 00:01:12.900
You are so generous

28
00:01:13.133 --> 00:01:14.533
My dad is going back today.

29
00:01:14.533 --> 00:01:16.666
Go to me to find Jiangnan

30
00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:20.200
Jiangnan

31
00:01:20.833 --> 00:01:21.633
uncle

32
00:01:21.966 --> 00:01:24.500
Oh mom, come to Uncle Jiangnan

33
00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:25.533
You still have the box on you.

34
00:01:25.533 --> 00:01:27.133
Why don't you stay in the hospital?

35
00:01:27.333 --> 00:01:30.033
Your mother is still waiting for you, he is not my mother

36
00:01:30.566 --> 00:01:31.700
He is Lin Wenli's mother

37
00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.200
How can you say such a sad thing?

38
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.966
My sister has cared for you for so many years

39
00:01:35.966 --> 00:01:37.166
That's all fake

40
00:01:37.166 --> 00:01:38.166
I know it's you.

41
00:01:38.166 --> 00:01:39.833
So I can't take someone else's mother's love anymore

42
00:01:39.833 --> 00:01:40.633
Chasing you

43
00:01:40.633 --> 00:01:43.833
Even if you haven't seen Tiannan, don't leave
