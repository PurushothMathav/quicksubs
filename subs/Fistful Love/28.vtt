1
00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.233
Others have blood type O

2
00:00:01.233 --> 00:00:02.333
What blood type are you?

3
00:00:02.766 --> 00:00:04.133
I seem to be type A

4
00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.366
What should I do, uncle, what blood type are you?

5
00:00:06.366 --> 00:00:07.333
I am also a type

6
00:00:07.433 --> 00:00:08.366
I am blood type b

7
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:10.466
Look at me. I'm blood type o

8
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:11.466
How could this be?

9
00:00:11.466 --> 00:00:12.300
Sister and Lin Wenli

10
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:13.766
The blood type is also exactly the same

11
00:00:13.766 --> 00:00:16.133
How can they have so many similarities?

12
00:00:16.433 --> 00:00:17.466
Come with me!

13
00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.166
As long as you can save the teacher

14
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.066
You can drain my blood

15
00:00:30.166 --> 00:00:31.733
Remember your contributions to patients

16
00:00:31.766 --> 00:00:33.066
Why don't you draw blood?

17
00:00:33.633 --> 00:00:34.566
I just tested it

18
00:00:34.566 --> 00:00:35.466
The lady and the patient

19
00:00:35.466 --> 00:00:37.800
There is a rejection reaction in the blood. What?

20
00:00:39.066 --> 00:00:41.000
Hurry up

21
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:42.500
How could this be?

22
00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:43.500
What about the patient?

23
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.733
You lose blood from another hospital

24
00:00:47.033 --> 00:00:50.000
Why did the nurse reject it?

25
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.500
The specific reason is not clear for the time being

26
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.866
But

27
00:00:51.866 --> 00:00:53.600
It is not ruled out that there is a relationship between this lady and the patient

28
00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:54.733
immediate family relationship

29
00:00:54.866 --> 00:00:56.233
What's right?

30
00:00:56.233 --> 00:00:58.566
Even if immediate family members share the same blood type

31
00:00:58.566 --> 00:01:00.800
There is a high probability of rejection when thinning blood

32
00:01:09.666 --> 00:01:12.600
Xiaonan's mother, it's great that you finally woke up.

33
00:01:14.033 --> 00:01:16.000
Hey, what about Wenli?

34
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.333
When is it that you still care about others?

35
00:01:18.433 --> 00:01:19.600
Have a good rest first, okay?

36
00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.433
Senior Sister Lin Wenli

37
00:01:21.433 --> 00:01:22.033
Look at you hurt

38
00:01:22.033 --> 00:01:24.666
It's too serious. He's afraid he'll have to pay for the medical bills.

39
00:01:24.666 --> 00:01:26.466
I fainted.

40
00:01:26.466 --> 00:01:28.600
I was hospitalized just now.

41
00:01:29.966 --> 00:01:32.100
Yes, Lin Wenli is an incompetent coward

42
00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.200
Shame on you.
