00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:07.933
Who is that?

2
00:00:07.933 --> 00:00:10.033
Why do you feel that you look better than Yanjiang Man?

3
00:00:10.033 --> 00:00:11.166
Are you blind?

4
00:00:11.166 --> 00:00:12.266
He is Lin Wenli

5
00:00:12.266 --> 00:00:13.666
What do you look good for? You look so ugly.

6
00:00:13.666 --> 00:00:15.733
I really thought I could be a phoenix without a chicken feather

7
00:00:15.733 --> 00:00:17.966
He still has the face to scum the birthday party

8
00:00:17.966 --> 00:00:20.133
It's thicker than pig skin

9
00:00:21.433 --> 00:00:22.833
Happy Birthday Jiangnan

10
00:00:23.533 --> 00:00:26.333
This is a gift for you, heart of the ocean, thank you uncle

11
00:00:27.033 --> 00:00:29.666
It's a coincidence that you have a birthday today, by the way, Jiangnan

12
00:00:29.733 --> 00:00:31.233
I also gave Wen Li the same gift.

13
00:00:31.233 --> 00:00:31.833
Mr. Yan

14
00:00:31.833 --> 00:00:35.300
How can you take Lin Wenli and your niece

15
00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:36.266
On a par?

16
00:00:36.266 --> 00:00:39.233
What kind of shit is Lin Wenli? Enough is enough.

17
00:00:39.366 --> 00:00:40.766
If you hadn't been hiding in the middle

18
00:00:40.766 --> 00:00:42.266
How could they have so many conflicts?

19
00:00:42.266 --> 00:00:44.266
Happy birthday to Yan Jiangnan

20
00:00:44.266 --> 00:00:46.633
I made this myself and gave it to you.

21
00:00:46.633 --> 00:00:48.433
I don't care what you can give me.

22
00:00:48.433 --> 00:00:50.900
I really don't know where you got such a big face

23
00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:52.766
Before coming here, play tricks to win the game

24
00:00:52.766 --> 00:00:54.100
You think you're not ashamed enough?

25
00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.633
Just pretend to say such a thing

26
00:00:56.633 --> 00:00:58.133
Get out of here as soon as possible

27
00:00:58.133 --> 00:00:59.233
Then I will

28
00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:01.366
Let's leave you alone.

29
00:01:03.333 --> 00:01:04.666
Hey, what are you doing?

30
00:01:04.666 --> 00:01:06.266
Did you hit me?

31
00:01:06.266 --> 00:01:07.933
Obviously you hit me first

32
00:01:07.933 --> 00:01:09.333
What the hell are you talking about?

33
00:01:09.333 --> 00:01:10.633
Are we all blind?

34
00:01:10.633 --> 00:01:12.700
Obviously, you hit Xiaomei first.

35
00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:13.966
How dare you!

36
00:01:13.966 --> 00:01:15.433
Forget it, uncle, don't speak for him

37
00:01:15.433 --> 00:01:16.033
Just go.

38
00:01:16.033 --> 00:01:17.666
Don't affect my birthday mood
