00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:04.466
Wen Li's mother is similar to Jialan

2
00:00:05.166 --> 00:00:07.266
Why is this, teacher?

3
00:00:07.933 --> 00:00:09.400
What are you thinking about?

4
00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:11.700
How could Jialan not be my daughter?

5
00:00:12.333 --> 00:00:14.300
I may have been too tired recently.

6
00:00:14.366 --> 00:00:16.100
It's getting crazy.

7
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.033
Coach Liu, Second Miss

8
00:00:22.166 --> 00:00:23.233
How are you feeling?

9
00:00:23.933 --> 00:00:26.033
Coach Liu, am I particularly stupid?

10
00:00:26.033 --> 00:00:28.733
Miss, I am teaching you your boxing skills.

11
00:00:28.733 --> 00:00:30.966
You are not just your mother's greatest work

12
00:00:30.966 --> 00:00:32.766
You are also my apprentice who has been carefully trained.

13
00:00:32.766 --> 00:00:34.800
But I don't even have a college as high as a plane

14
00:00:36.166 --> 00:00:38.333
It's all accidental

15
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:39.966
You have to believe me.

16
00:00:39.966 --> 00:00:42.766
By the way, the fighting match is about to start

17
00:00:42.766 --> 00:00:45.133
The gold belt must belong to you.

18
00:00:45.133 --> 00:00:47.666
I promise to thank you, Coach Liu

19
00:00:48.333 --> 00:00:50.566
In addition, Lihong dares to bully me alone

20
00:00:50.566 --> 00:00:53.933
Miss, I must make you pay

21
00:01:00.166 --> 00:01:00.966
Small golden pillar

22
00:01:01.533 --> 00:01:03.133
Who let you into this sandbag?

23
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:04.933
Aren't sandbags for people to use?

24
00:01:04.933 --> 00:01:08.166
You don't even look whose sandbag you're using

25
00:01:08.166 --> 00:01:10.633
This is Miss Yan's special sandbag

26
00:01:10.633 --> 00:01:12.100
You use the eldest lady's sandbag

27
00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:13.366
Do you want to die?

28
00:01:13.366 --> 00:01:15.000
I'm sorry, Miss Yan

29
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.733
I didn't know this was your special sandbag

30
00:01:16.833 --> 00:01:17.833
Are you feeling better?

31
00:01:17.833 --> 00:01:20.200
Lin Wenli is something that doesn't belong to you

32
00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.033
I advise you not to be delusional

33
00:01:22.833 --> 00:01:25.233
Coach Liu threw the sandbag out

34
00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.400
Garbage should stay in the trash can
