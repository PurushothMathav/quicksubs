00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:12.066
His mouth hurts

2
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.000
Painful

3
00:00:14.533 --> 00:00:16.133
He just feels guilty about me

4
00:00:16.233 --> 00:00:19.133
He cares about you

5
00:00:19.233 --> 00:00:20.566
He wants you to be well.

6
00:00:20.566 --> 00:00:22.133
I don't know if I should leave him alone.

7
00:00:22.133 --> 00:00:24.433
Anyway, I'm over it.

8
00:00:24.433 --> 00:00:25.600
Let's talk about what to do together

9
00:00:28.633 --> 00:00:29.933
Thanks for pinching my face

10
00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:31.800
I have learned a lot from you

11
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:39.466
I decided to go back.

12
00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.166
Give you a few days to get the last existence.

13
00:00:48.566 --> 00:00:49.366
future

14
00:00:49.966 --> 00:00:51.166
You are back.

15
00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.666
Why don't you find mom

16
00:00:53.133 --> 00:00:54.566
Do you hate me?

17
00:00:54.566 --> 00:00:55.566
How come?

18
00:00:55.566 --> 00:00:57.100
I can still call you mom

19
00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.966
I just don't know how to face you

20
00:00:58.966 --> 00:01:01.433
I'm sorry, you silly child.

21
00:01:01.433 --> 00:01:04.166
I'm sorry, mom threw me back

22
00:01:04.166 --> 00:01:05.500
Engraved in mother's heart

23
00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.866
You will always be your mother's child

24
00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:09.666
Would you still like to be your mother's child?

25
00:01:10.533 --> 00:01:11.600
Mom, I do.

26
00:01:12.333 --> 00:01:14.500
I do, mom.

27
00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.000
We will all be your daughters from now on

28
00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:18.266
Ok ok

29
00:01:20.133 --> 00:01:22.633
All right, your game on April 14th

From what you can see, the approval rating of both sides is very high

41
00:02:00.133 --> 00:02:04.200
So which of the two players will win this UMV?

42
00:02:04.266 --> 00:02:07.233
The Ultimate Fighting Championship gold belt

00:02:07.233 --> 00:02:09.600

What do the two sides want to tell each other?

47
00:02:19.533 --> 00:02:20.333
No matter the outcome

00:02:20.333 --> 00:02:21.633
How I hope

49
00:02:21.633 --> 00:02:24.466
We can throw every punch without regret

50
00:02:26.333 --> 00:02:27.300
You are still so verbose

51
00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:28.433
But I want to say

52
00:02:28.466 --> 00:02:29.966
The gold belt must be mine

53
00:02:29.966 --> 00:02:31.533
Ok ok ok
