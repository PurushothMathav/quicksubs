00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:00.766
sister

2
00:00:00.766 --> 00:00:03.100
I know about Wenli, you are wrong to blame him

3
00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:05.366
But it's true that he punched

4
00:00:05.366 --> 00:00:07.733
I immediately owe the dead money to 1 million usury

5
00:00:07.866 --> 00:00:10.000
Black boxing is also forced to be helpless

6
00:00:10.033 --> 00:00:12.266
I really didn't mean to do black boxing.

7
00:00:12.266 --> 00:00:13.033
teacher

8
00:00:13.033 --> 00:00:15.633
I really, really like the fighting arena

9
00:00:15.633 --> 00:00:17.633
Why didn't you tell the teacher earlier?

10
00:00:17.633 --> 00:00:18.800
Because I always knew

11
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.533
You especially hate black boxing

12
00:00:20.566 --> 00:00:23.500
So I never dared to tell you

13
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.033
So have you paid off the loan shark now?

14
00:00:26.033 --> 00:00:27.500
I have already paid it back for him.

15
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.766
The bad guys have no reason to look for him anymore

16
00:00:30.033 --> 00:00:32.166
Uncle, that's 1 million

17
00:00:32.166 --> 00:00:33.866
You have no relatives with him for no reason. Why?

18
00:00:33.866 --> 00:00:36.033
Jiangnan, this is my own money

19
00:00:36.033 --> 00:00:37.433
I can give it to whoever I want

20
00:00:37.433 --> 00:00:39.166
Uncle, you are about to play

21
00:00:39.166 --> 00:00:40.233
You two hurry up and go to training

22
00:00:40.233 --> 00:00:41.800
I have something to say to my sister

23
00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.000
Thank you Uncle Yan

24
00:00:45.566 --> 00:00:46.700
This fox

25
00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:48.866
I didn't expect you to be such a fun uncle

26
00:00:50.966 --> 00:00:52.833
Shouldn't it be just about Wenli?

27
00:00:52.833 --> 00:00:55.666
What are your thoughts on the Black Spring Market?

28
00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.133
No I just know

29
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.000
Underground Black Spring in Dragon City

30
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.033
Something to do with the Black Springs market

31
00:01:04.033 --> 00:01:07.733
But who is behind all this?

32
00:01:08.666 --> 00:01:09.433
I don't know.

33
00:01:09.433 --> 00:01:10.766
Only lead the snake out of the hole

34
00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.833
To hit our black hands

35
00:01:12.833 --> 00:01:14.466
I see what you mean.

36
00:01:14.566 --> 00:01:17.600
Then let Liang Hongtao come back
