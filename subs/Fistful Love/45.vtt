00:00:00.433 --> 00:00:02.366
Hi sister-in-law, what's the matter with you?

2
00:00:02.366 --> 00:00:03.400
Ignore this idiot

3
00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:05.266
I think he blocked the Yan family

4
00:00:05.366 --> 00:00:07.366
You must pay for blocking the Yan family's difficult camp.

5
00:00:07.366 --> 00:00:08.966
This guy is an idiot

6
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.800
These two are both very strong seeded players

7
00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.466
Who will win?

8
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.333
If only I could get them to pay for me in private

9
00:00:18.466 --> 00:00:20.266
End of the second round

10
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.366
The formulas of the two sides are basically the same

11
00:00:22.366 --> 00:00:25.200
It depends on the performance of the two in the next round

12
00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:27.466
Jialan, control your emotions

13
00:00:27.466 --> 00:00:28.300
Steady your mind

14
00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:29.300
Don't worry.

15
00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:30.633
Even if I don't win this time

16
00:00:30.633 --> 00:00:32.133
I will also make you extremely

17
00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:33.200
Cut it out.

18
00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.300
I must win this game on my own

19
00:00:35.466 --> 00:00:38.366
Who will advance to the finals on April 14?

20
00:00:38.366 --> 00:00:40.533
Let's wait and see.

21
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.766
Li Wenli, I didn't let you enough just now

22
00:00:46.766 --> 00:00:48.733
In fact, it's not that ugly to let you lose

23
00:00:48.866 --> 00:00:50.200
Do you always see?

24
00:01:11.233 --> 00:01:12.200
Oh wow.

25
00:01:13.966 --> 00:01:15.100
This is a human rights draw

26
00:01:15.166 --> 00:01:16.133
Audience friends

27
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.600
Saw the superhero dog reappear in the fighting arena

28
00:01:19.266 --> 00:01:20.200
What superhero dog?

29
00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.466
You are stupid, it was Yan Ziqi 18 years ago

30
00:01:22.466 --> 00:01:24.433
Yan Boxing King won with one move

31
00:01:24.433 --> 00:01:26.000
Superman Boxing

32
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.766
I didn't expect anyone to use this trick now

33
00:01:28.866 --> 00:01:32.466
What is the relationship between Lin Wenli and Yan Boxing King?

34
00:01:32.866 --> 00:01:35.133
I still want that trick to win my dream
