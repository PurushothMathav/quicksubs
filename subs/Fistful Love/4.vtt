00:00:00.666 --> 00:00:02.500
What's your trouble?

2
00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:03.966
Actually, how old are you?

3
00:00:04.233 --> 00:00:06.333
18 years old is a coincidence

4
00:00:06.333 --> 00:00:08.100
As big as Jiangnan

5
00:00:08.733 --> 00:00:10.266
How about your parents? Are they okay?

6
00:00:10.266 --> 00:00:12.400
My parents are gone

7
00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:16.933
Come to our Boji Pavilion to learn

8
00:00:16.933 --> 00:00:19.533
You are a good seedling and cannot be buried in a place like this

9
00:00:19.533 --> 00:00:20.733
What you said is true.

10
00:00:20.733 --> 00:00:22.466
My sister is Grunny King

11
00:00:22.466 --> 00:00:25.300
You're lucky to be appreciated by him

12
00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:26.733
I heard that you will be superhuman

13
00:00:26.733 --> 00:00:27.666
Can you teach me?

14
00:00:27.666 --> 00:00:29.400
We are strict about super human rights

15
00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:30.800
Unique Longchen

16
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.733
If you learn from him well

17
00:00:32.733 --> 00:00:35.433
If you lie to you, you will be the next poor one.

18
00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:36.566
But

19
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.700
He owed a lot of money when my mom was sick

20
00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:42.233
I work every day now to pay him back

21
00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.733
I'm afraid I don't have time to study with you.

22
00:00:45.733 --> 00:00:47.800
Hey you child

23
00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.233
My sister can see you

24
00:00:49.233 --> 00:00:50.900
You haven't taken advantage of this opportunity

25
00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:52.233
I'm sorry, Mr. Yang

26
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.900
I let you down, Liwen Li

27
00:00:56.133 --> 00:00:58.233
I can see you like boxing

28
00:00:58.233 --> 00:00:59.700
You can't because of this

29
00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:01.700
Just give up on your own dreams

30
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:05.600
Humph

31
00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.166
I think you are shortsighted

32
00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.766
Mud can't hold up to the wall

33
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.733
No wonder he's still fighting black boxing here

34
00:01:11.733 --> 00:01:13.300
What's wrong with black boxing?

35
00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.033
What does it mean to give up your dream?

36
00:01:15.033 --> 00:01:18.066
Do people like us have the right to dream?

37
00:01:18.066 --> 00:01:19.800
Those of you who were born rich

38
00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.733
Do you know the difficulties of us poor people?

39
00:01:22.133 --> 00:01:24.266
We can survive in this world

40
00:01:24.266 --> 00:01:26.800
I'm already doing my best

41
00:01:28.833 --> 00:01:30.166
How much do you owe?

42
00:01:30.433 --> 00:01:31.533
I'll pay it back for you.

43
00:01:32.066 --> 00:01:34.800
1 million in this card will report to the International Pavilion tomorrow
