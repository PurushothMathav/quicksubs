00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:01.933
Don't be angry scum

2
00:00:01.933 --> 00:00:03.100
It's mom's fault

3
00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:04.366
Mom shouldn't have said that

4
00:00:04.366 --> 00:00:06.766
But his super human rights were really not taught by his mother

5
00:00:06.766 --> 00:00:08.466
You have to trust your mother.

6
00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:11.800
Okay, mom, about my illness

7
00:00:11.866 --> 00:00:13.200
Must not let anyone know

8
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.466
Otherwise it can become a fighting competition

9
00:00:14.466 --> 00:00:15.466
I won't have a chance

10
00:00:15.466 --> 00:00:16.633
But

11
00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:19.633
I will definitely listen to the doctor when you are sick.

12
00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:20.600
Treat well

13
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.133
It must not delay the game.

14
00:00:22.133 --> 00:00:24.200
Mom, I really don't want to pass up this opportunity.

15
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.633
I beg you

16
00:00:26.733 --> 00:00:29.266
Mom promises you promise you

17
00:00:29.266 --> 00:00:30.400
There is also the International Pavilion

18
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:32.300
Plus that Li Wenli

19
00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:34.033
Make sure they don't tell.

20
00:00:37.866 --> 00:00:39.533
How is scum?

21
00:00:39.533 --> 00:00:40.966
He is awake

22
00:00:40.966 --> 00:00:42.366
I'm sorry, teacher.

23
00:00:42.366 --> 00:00:44.366
I don't know scum's condition

24
00:00:44.366 --> 00:00:46.300
Can you still be hospitalized?

25
00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:47.766
It's not your fault

26
00:00:47.766 --> 00:00:50.666
But you must not take the scumbag's illness

27
00:00:50.666 --> 00:00:51.666
Say it

28
00:00:51.766 --> 00:00:53.566
I know, don't worry.

29
00:00:53.566 --> 00:00:55.800
Hey, Wenli

30
00:00:56.166 --> 00:00:57.800
Where did you learn Superman boxing?

31
00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.033
I don't know.

32
00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.800
I just know that punch was my last chance

33
00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:03.466
I had no other choice.

34
00:01:03.466 --> 00:01:05.200
I will give you everything

35
00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.700
You mean you stole without a teacher?

36
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.600
He punched Superman.

37
00:01:12.966 --> 00:01:15.566
Is this child like me?

38
00:01:15.566 --> 00:01:17.566
I realized superhuman rights.

39
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.033
Why did you ask that?

40
00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.666
Did you really not learn to fight?

41
00:01:24.666 --> 00:01:26.766
I live with my mother

42
00:01:26.933 --> 00:01:29.700
Never been in combat before black boxing

43
00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:30.833
What about your mother?

44
00:01:31.366 --> 00:01:32.633
Can he fight?

45
00:01:32.866 --> 00:01:33.900
Neither will he

46
00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.566
He's just a very, very ordinary person

47
00:01:37.166 --> 00:01:39.633
He had epilepsy, just like Canon.

48
00:01:39.966 --> 00:01:42.766
What? Your mother has epilepsy?
