00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:02.830
People's Bank of China won't change its name if it doesn't change its gender,

2
00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:05.320
The Li family's crime is unclear.

3
00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:08.490
You are not dead.

4
00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:11.070
You said this, since someone wants to kill me,

5
00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:14.270
I answer every request. I will die,

6
00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:15.350
Make everyone happy.

7
00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:17.310
After all, the emperor gave too much money,

8
00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:19.580
I came here with my heart in mind. You came here to prove it,

9
00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:21.900
Palace, you are not afraid that this will kill you.

10
00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:25.030
Are you not blind? It's not a big deal.

11
00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.900
Even if it means he can't protect you.

12
00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:32.549
You are right. So I arranged for 30,000 people to be sent to the south of the province outside the city.

13
00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:35.130
I have no choice but to give it to my father-in-law.

14
00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.410
I only wanted 5,000 and he gave me 30,000.

15
00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.790
I really need to contact the outside world.

16
00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:40.570
ensure safety

17
00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:43.270
What if Tefu Rabbit doesn’t have my contact information?

18
00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:44.830
What will my father-in-law do?

19
00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:46.090
Then I don't know

20
00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:48.490
Tell me about your position in the palace

21
00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:49.950
Only ten thousand people

22
00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.070
I don’t know if I can beat the party or live with my iron rabbit.

23
00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:54.480
Sure enough, a hero comes from a boy

24
00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:56.140
Don't dare to fight. Don't dare to fight. Don't dare to fight.

25
00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.620
He is indeed Li Ming’s son-in-law. Thank you.

26
00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.170
But you can lose weight

27
00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:04.750
There are still more than 200,000 troops

28
00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.400
you have you have

29
00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.170
But is it useful?

30
00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:12.370
Your army of more than 200,000 people is scattered in various places.

31
00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:13.830
Will you find them now?

32
00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.170
Come here to force me to be an outsider.

33
00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:16.770
Do you think we investigated clearly?

34
00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.490
What do you call nobles of the Qing Dynasty?

35
00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:22.380
The right place

36
00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:25.280
I just want this commander to give His Majesty a chance.

37
00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:26.780
Your Majesty, don't be ignorant
