1
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:08.880
False?

2
00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.480
Don't even understand,

3
00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:12.760
If you get angry, you won't get dirty.

4
00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:16.079
I didn't expect you to be so big here, please beg me now.

5
00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:18.580
I used to be afraid,

6
00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:20.720
Now you are afraid, but now the business is bigger,

7
00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:22.340
You are not afraid that my father and my father will know.

8
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.130
I'm doing my homework, he doesn't understand the royal principles,

9
00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:26.710
This has no name and is opposed to real reason.

10
00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:31.240
Today, you have made the whole world full of trouble. Remember,

11
00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:33.060
The second is like the Yellow Palace, I heard,

12
00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:35.240
What keeps the entire Yellow Palace trouble-free is basic management.

13
00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:36.710
But he did it for you

14
00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:38.000
At that time when Lian Shuaiyin

15
00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:39.150
Just a few days

16
00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:43.140
What's wrong with him after I finish my handsome seal?

17
00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:44.160
Don't worry

18
00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.480
In fact, Hou Ben Wang’s light machine

19
00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:53.780
He decided that I was anxious to find the unknown prince.

20
00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:55.540
It's not that he's in a hurry

21
00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:57.500
I was forced into it, but

22
00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:00.210
I have to thank my emperor

23
00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.170
If it weren't for what he did,

24
00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.640
Even if you don’t know, you won’t get angry.

25
00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:06.740
Like I said

26
00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:07.920
This woman talks

27
00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.430
Just yelling at my husband

28
00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:12.070
It should also start from that person’s level

29
00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.080
If His Highness hadn't been a child at that time,

30
00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:15.760
So far, I can only get him to do it.

31
00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:16.720
I'll do you too

32
00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:18.300
Originally belongs to His Highness

33
00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:19.580
I like to hear this

34
00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:22.940
Now that I'm in a coma, I don't want to eat.

35
00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:24.120
How's it going over there?

36
00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:26.220
I guess someone did it too

37
00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:29.280
I had already begun to have sweet dreams about crashing.

38
00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.480
Just tie him up and let his men

39
00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:32.660
Go catch the actress Ran

40
00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:34.460
I tied him up just to make him cry.

41
00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:36.990
But now it’s time to faint. This is the seventh point.

42
00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:38.890
Did you bring Xingran back to me?
