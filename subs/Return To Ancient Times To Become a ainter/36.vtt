1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.160
I can give you money, although Wujia is not a big family,

2
00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:05.410
But I still had no business.

3
00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:07.550
I am not interested in homeless companies.

4
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.020
So what do you want? You can’t let go of money.

5
00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:11.560
This immeasurable thing cannot be let go.

6
00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:15.240
He distorted the world in front of Nuting, Your Majesty Kou Pian,

7
00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:16.980
Even if I have the ability to release him.

8
00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:19.280
Can you learn from him?

9
00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:26.110
There are no men in your family, I am a woman,

10
00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:27.570
How can we afford this huge problem?

11
00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:29.930
What should I do if I lose my home and business?

12
00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:34.030
Girl Zhao, even though this immeasurable thing is gone,

13
00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:36.560
But I can keep you useless for the rest of your life.

14
00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.400
Just take care of me twice and I don’t want to

15
00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:39.860
what would you like

16
00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:41.300
Even though I am married to my boss

17
00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:42.960
But on the bright screen, you are your sister-in-law

18
00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:44.910
Although I can’t blame him for having other big thoughts

19
00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.830
But who made you so beautiful?

20
00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:49.110
But your eldest brother’s slightly married wife

21
00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.400
Aren't you still married?

22
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:52.620
I should think it over

23
00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:53.960
Now there is no limitless

24
00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.120
I'm the only one left with no home to take care of.

25
00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.280
You should find another man

26
00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:01.340
You don’t want others to call you shameless all the time.

27
00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:02.160
you are so young

28
00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:02.880
Do you have children?

29
00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:05.760
Do you want to give Wuliang a living flower?

30
00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:06.520
You are so unlucky

31
00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:08.460
Can you afford your brother? That’s right.

32
00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.430
It would be better if you were here
