00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:05.020
original party

2
00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:06.660
What do you think about the moon?

3
00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:08.910
I won’t tell you. You are asking Cheng Yuzhan

4
00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:10.600
shock him

5
00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:13.460
Now that we are here, people from two countries and ten people came to visit us.

6
00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:17.010
We should send someone to try him out

7
00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.600
Who to send? Who to send?

8
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:23.910
Send yourself, I don’t want you to react to someone who has participated in birth and raised a short period of time.

9
00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.480
What do you think I should do to you?

10
00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:39.240
Don't worry. Yue Chang, I'm lonely. Taizhen, this killing was successful.

11
00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:43.460
This unknown person, let us have two countries to confer Kerry as soon as the news comes out

12
00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:45.800
Can you calm the people down?

13
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.840
That's heart-warming news

14
00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.380
Damn it if it suits you

15
00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:51.430
But this is nameless

16
00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:52.690
A polite son-in-law

17
00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:54.030
if she dies

18
00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:57.450
If politeness takes off, it's time to work hard

19
00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:59.350
This Wuming is the coach after all

20
00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:00.630
What does the coach mean?

21
00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:02.900
The Li family's army is in chaos enough to unite

22
00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:03.960
This little time

23
00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.880
Tell me to assemble the army

24
00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.340
It will be me then

25
00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:13.780
I really thought that my good country was so angry that I failed Your Majesty.

26
00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:15.900
actual visit

27
00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:17.020
Nameless meaning

28
00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:18.360
They warm up

29
00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.150
I really ask the sect to come up with the essence

30
00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:23.160
It turned out that they did it after they were taught

31
00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.500
I really want to see what the actual purpose of this is.

32
00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:30.730
Passed by the envoy Wuming

33
00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:35.240
Meet the Emperor of Shang, who are you?
