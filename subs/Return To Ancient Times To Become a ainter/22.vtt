00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:05.680
These are you kissing this thing, Feng Jian Mingxin?

2
00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:10.880
Or is it not your child? Don’t listen to nonsense?

3
00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:12.570
You still call me arguing?

4
00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:14.700
There is no intention to say more, who else?

5
00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:27.500
No permission to write?

6
00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:28.640
So what words?

7
00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:45.130
Let’s tolerate it! Let’s tolerate it!

8
00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:51.010
What else is wrong to say?

9
00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:12.300
Your Majesty, what crime did I just ask me to commit?

10
00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:15.250
You abandon your arrogance and blatantly question your righteousness,

11
00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.020
Even if I kill you, you are not worthy of my beloved!

12
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.580
It's not enough to have a good habit of dying, and it's a crime to want to have a family flag, let alone nothing like this?

13
00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:31.290
Written by Wang Shiren, the evidence is early

14
00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:32.740
You still said I was wronged

15
00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.180
Just use one machine to write Ren Qianying

16
00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:37.100
Just make sure this child is mine

17
00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:38.200
Simply ignorant

18
00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:39.660
The first person to write Ren Qian

19
00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:41.460
That is the method of inheriting thousands of names

20
00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:44.300
How dare you say it was a mistake?

21
00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:46.260
Then I'll use what you call

22
00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.080
How to machine write Ren Qian

23
00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:49.460
Give you a TV

24
00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:51.600
Let’s cut off the literary stream and come up again

25
00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:54.060
Hurry up and place the currency

26
00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.140
Hurry up and move yours away from writing?
