00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:04.980
Your lobby, this is really what you can do in person for a night.

2
00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.210
You have to surrender. Who can do it in this position? You can't do it except to save you.

3
00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:09.770
If you do it again, I'll call someone.

4
00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:12.530
This place is so big, I can find two places by myself.

5
00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:13.170
I mean.

6
00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:16.550
Just let go and do it together. It’s not what you’re doing. Be careful.

7
00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.500
Li Xiao, you said this palace is so big,

8
00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:22.660
I can live my life alone. Shouldn't you arrange a trousers for me?

9
00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:27.020
I think the queen's work is good, you can do it. Sent.

10
00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:31.110
My mother, you are too cautious in angering people.

11
00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:32.910
I still have someone to regenerate. Do you want to listen?

12
00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.810
I'm wondering if there's any way

13
00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:37.050
I can make this fine minister for a moment

14
00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.040
Stealing the truth

15
00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:40.560
Anyway, this fine minister

16
00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:41.300
I haven't thought about it either

17
00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:44.320
I just want to see if my wish can come true. Think about it.

18
00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.020
I'm the one who takes people with me

19
00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.530
I'm scared to death

20
00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:49.490
Yes slippery

21
00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:51.990
This kneeling envoy wants to visit the palace

22
00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.810
Really impartial?

23
00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:54.570
Just take it with you

24
00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.090
Kneel down to have a good look

25
00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:59.270
Look at the palace of my previous country

26
00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:04.849
How is it different from the Qingguo Palace? Hello, Your Majesty

27
00:01:04.849 --> 00:01:06.750
Because of his stubbornness

28
00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.690
He can kill two hundred thousand people with one glance

29
00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:10.750
Even if what he said is false

30
00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:13.030
This cannot be done without punishing the queen

31
00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:16.480
I hope you can give me something

32
00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.170
I promise you

33
00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:19.650
As long as I solve the problem of the earth

34
00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.860
one way or another

35
00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:22.880
I can't live without you
