00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.060
No, it's impossible.

2
00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:04.840
What's wrong, I think it's impossible for Xiao Qian to still be alive.

3
00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:06.300
No, I don't know what you are talking about.

4
00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:07.940
I also brought Xiao Qian back to Jiangquanzi,

5
00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:09.720
If you don't believe me, you can go back with me.

6
00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:12.630
It shows that there must be something in this, and it’s not nonsense.

7
00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:14.650
Isn’t it okay to see Xiaoqian lying to me?

8
00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:16.530
After seeing me with your own eyes, black body is,

9
00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:18.170
Could it be that his old eyes are talking to me?

10
00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:20.130
Why didn't he say he saw someone else?

11
00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:21.770
The true king just went to protect him,

12
00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:23.630
To protect him, to protect him, is to eat great things like he was born to do,

13
00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:24.230
What kind of killing.

14
00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:26.270
Just press this button, do you think so?

15
00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:28.610
This, this is what I did, it has nothing to do with Your Highness,

16
00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:30.270
It is my beloved Majesty's hospital.

17
00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:33.520
Run a dog next door to the center

18
00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:34.820
Is it because you bid crazy prices?

19
00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:36.360
I won't go down the street.

20
00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:37.240
I blinded you

21
00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:38.390
It's in your hand

22
00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.990
A few pieces of royal pledge

23
00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:44.020
Really step back, step back

24
00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.080
I'll give you a few bucks

25
00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:47.400
Don't cherish it

26
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:48.780
This thing is a mistake

27
00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.080
This will definitely find someone new

28
00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:51.960
What are your limitations? Can you tell me about them?

29
00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:53.420
In fact, after

30
00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:54.870
Make friends and create new people

31
00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:55.830
Let's meet

32
00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:56.690
Don't call me righteous

33
00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:58.840
I just showed it to me

34
00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:59.720
I found out that

35
00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:02.520
No one thinks I’m a technician

36
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:03.960
hold technology
