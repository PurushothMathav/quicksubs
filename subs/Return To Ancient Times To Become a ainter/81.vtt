00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.320
I don’t know, can you really pack the day?

2
00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:05.820
In front of my woman, you dared to talk about killing my four seasons.

3
00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.500
Remember, let’s not dress clearly and pretend to be confused.

4
00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.360
Your four younger brothers are ruthless in throwing away your throne.

5
00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:15.510
This is my strength, and it is not your turn as an outsider to speak.

6
00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.510
Then I will tell you, I have already negotiated the experience with the four princes.

7
00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:21.590
In fact, they helped me find Appreciation,

8
00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:22.730
And I'm going to do it cheaply.

9
00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.390
In fact, after that, there will be a chance to force the palace.

10
00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:27.980
Sure enough, we have to do it

11
00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:29.780
Doesn't that mean you must be too tight?

12
00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:32.200
The more I move my palms, the more people from Qing Dynasty finally advance.

13
00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:33.040
Then what did you do?

14
00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:34.400
Li Jia controls too much

15
00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:36.760
If people don’t understand, why not do it now?

16
00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:37.960
Li Jia couldn't control it either

17
00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:39.360
I'm not making a law

18
00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.340
I call this wave chaos anyway.

19
00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.280
Now is to give His Majesty a chance

20
00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.200
Your Majesty does not have the first public lineage in the entertainment industry

21
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.820
But I solved the thinking prince

22
00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.880
The emperor is still

23
00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:51.510
if you don't agree

24
00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.110
I can only add real clothes

25
00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:54.550
Do you think you are really scared?

26
00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:56.880
Are you afraid that your Majesty will know for yourself?

27
00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:57.800
But you don't have a choice

28
00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.040
A woman takes charge of government affairs

29
00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:01.320
Heba at home

30
00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.420
What you face after holding on

31
00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:03.570
It's not just me

32
00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.090
It's not a group charity

33
00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:07.110
I agree, but there is a condition

34
00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.610
Li Jia must hand over military power

35
00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:09.910
I, Li Jia, didn’t respond either.

36
00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:11.560
Now it's not because

37
00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.840
Chen Qinzhong’s background was unfortunate after he became the official

38
00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:14.980
Someone will definitely stand up

39
00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:16.540
It’s just that Huang is really buying without intention

40
00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:18.820
Then who will Li Jiahui support?

41
00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:21.520
This is what I was worried about.

42
00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:23.110
I have an idea Li Jia

43
00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:25.530
If your child learns five

44
00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.400
Is Li Jia still afraid?
