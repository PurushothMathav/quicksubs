00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:10.170
Itâ€™s delicious! We just told you something.

2
00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.600
How can we do this?

3
00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:15.680
The poem about today's arrest is true.

4
00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:21.790
Every kind of poem he wrote just now is better than the line of poetry you just wrote.

5
00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:26.780
What the hell kind of monster are you? I'm the one you've both been through forever.

6
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:28.900
No matter what you say.

7
00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:33.380
Memory or something?

8
00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:35.600
What else do you want to compare? I took them all.

9
00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:38.320
We've lost something.

10
00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:41.050
Then can I still accept it if I am so bad?

11
00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:43.370
Yes, we can do it soon.

12
00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.070
Coming back is not leaving

13
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.160
What did you say five seconds?

14
00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.140
Don't kick people and look at them

15
00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.880
My father still has a voice after all.

16
00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:55.820
Give up and come here

17
00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:56.920
Wait me a moment

18
00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.500
Bring the Holy Son to marry

19
00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.120
You already know the generation of failure

20
00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.110
Either get out or die

21
00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:06.810
The two of us are in Beijing anyway

22
00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:09.270
He is also a respectable person for five seconds.

23
00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.690
Don't go too far

24
00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:12.290
It seems like you two have a bad face

25
00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:14.400
If I don't want to die, then I will

26
00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:18.020
Send someone to us quickly

27
00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.920
let's come

28
00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:32.100
Oops, the troublemaker is gone

29
00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:37.720
