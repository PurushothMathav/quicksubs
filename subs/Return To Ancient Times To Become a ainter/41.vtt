00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:02.540
Nonsense, simply nonsense.

2
00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:04.740
Can this matter be solved and settled?

3
00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:07.990
Even if you are ancient. We can't use hundreds of thousands of Jiang Shi's machines to wipe out,

4
00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:10.910
Let me read it for you. Yes, this matter is non-negotiable.

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:12.900
You want to maintain production. us,

6
00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.670
Come on, I can issue a military order,

7
00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.470
Do not destroy the ancient Chinese fantasy. And this victory ruler can only be five pieces, run.

8
00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.040
The demolition order goes down and from the next day,

9
00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:26.320
Unnamed, must be deleted.

10
00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:28.200
Including the iron frame pictures, all codes have been changed.

11
00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:30.790
The city will investigate anonymously, for the order,

12
00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:32.930
Check without shooting. Respect your position.

13
00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:34.080
my philosophy

14
00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:37.840
Ask the coach to reply to Sister Zhang

15
00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:39.190
The news came later

16
00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:40.860
The reason for living with the same fate was found

17
00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:42.540
Someone is hurting something big

18
00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:43.660
Spread respect for the emperor

19
00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:45.160
It is reasonable to think of hurting the country

20
00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:46.500
To Xiaojie and my uncle

21
00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:47.850
And let my uncle take charge

22
00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.090
Destroy the country in one fell swoop

23
00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:50.130
Let uncle Yangming

24
00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:51.490
After hearing this, the emperor hurt the country

25
00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:52.810
I feel inspired by Qishu

26
00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:53.710
Big farmers send troops

27
00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:55.590
Showing mountains and battlefields with my general uncle

28
00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:58.020
Can lies kill me?

29
00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:00.560
Then look at the picture
