00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:07.550
Everyone, have you seen the job? Do you have any thoughts?

2
00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:09.760
Your Majesty, is this too much?

3
00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:11.790
He actually let my uncle take charge

4
00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:12.750
Upright and confident

5
00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.400
My uncle is going to give a shit about it

6
00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.700
Everyone, I'm still here. Save your face.

7
00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:22.120
Brother-in-law, I am waiting for someone to come out. If you want to make trouble, you can say whatever you want.

8
00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:26.180
Don't be so weird, General. It's okay if you don't answer in this life.

9
00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.490
I will be away from home and will not be punished.

10
00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.590
You think too much. Think about it.

11
00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:36.390
Why did Your Majesty leave the newlyweds in the capital?

12
00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:40.500
Play this general with us

13
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:41.200
It's really not possible

14
00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:45.150
If we rebel, we may win, but

15
00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:46.610
Left alone is also Guangcuo

16
00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.440
It’s hard to know if we don’t let us know

17
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:50.540
It's too much to look outside and look outside.

18
00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:52.400
After all, we still need to have the respect we deserve.

19
00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:54.750
That’s two months for me

20
00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.230
I close the light and break the fruit
