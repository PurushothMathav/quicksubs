00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:00.933
Miss

2
00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:12.900
So pretty lady, that's enough to surpass peanuts

3
00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.500
We found the uncle

4
00:00:15.766 --> 00:00:18.300
What goes beyond peanuts and what finds the uncle?

5
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.933
I heard it all. I'm past that peanut

6
00:00:20.933 --> 00:00:22.566
You recognize yourself.

7
00:00:22.566 --> 00:00:25.066
If you don't want to get married, just let me go?

8
00:00:25.066 --> 00:00:26.633
Well, no.

9
00:00:26.666 --> 00:00:28.133
If I let others know that I personally

10
00:00:28.133 --> 00:00:29.400
Break the assessment rules

11
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:30.966
What will Qingguo think of me then?

12
00:00:30.966 --> 00:00:33.266
The Li family will also become the laughing stock of the whole world

13
00:00:33.366 --> 00:00:36.600
Fuck you really want to marry me, you dream

14
00:00:36.666 --> 00:00:38.200
You don't want to marry me, you don't want to die

15
00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:39.866
I have a way to get the best of both worlds

16
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:41.900
How?

17
00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:43.700
Let me go first

18
00:00:47.066 --> 00:00:49.333
You can announce first that I have completed the assessment

19
00:00:49.333 --> 00:00:50.300
To be your husband

20
00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.100
Then I ran away under the guise of going back to prepare

21
00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.500
You can chase me in two days.

22
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.800
Then release the news that it has nothing to do with you that I ran away from marriage

23
00:00:57.933 --> 00:00:59.733
What if you get caught?

24
00:00:59.733 --> 00:01:00.733
Are you stupid?

25
00:01:00.733 --> 00:01:02.100
You can come to me in person.

26
00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.400
Can I be caught by then?

27
00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:04.666
It's not up to you

28
00:01:07.066 --> 00:01:08.100
What to do

29
00:01:08.266 --> 00:01:11.033
Then wish us a happy cooperation in advance.

30
00:01:12.133 --> 00:01:13.166
OK

31
00:01:14.333 --> 00:01:17.966
Hahaha, looking for a fight, ah, wrong, wrong, wrong.

32
00:01:18.533 --> 00:01:20.400
Do you think it is possible?

33
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.666
Does this kid really have a chance to take down this female devil?

34
00:01:23.666 --> 00:01:25.800
It's not that I despise him for being nameless.

35
00:01:26.166 --> 00:01:29.266
The chaos in the previous dynasty of Xinguo was a war fought for decades

36
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.100
Those legacies of Huasheng?

37
00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:32.966
Long ago drowned in the flames of war

38
00:01:32.966 --> 00:01:35.100
Without inheritance, what can he do to surpass Huasheng?

39
00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.300
Yes, what does he surpass?

40
00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.466
To rely on is to die

41
00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.133
You can't hold out too much hope

42
00:01:43.133 --> 00:01:45.900
Why don't we go celebrate?

43
00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:47.800
I managed to avoid disaster again today

44
00:01:48.066 --> 00:01:49.666
Walk like silk

45
00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:50.133
Hey

46
00:01:50.133 --> 00:01:52.566
That's a good idea. Go, go, go, go, go.

47
00:01:52.866 --> 00:01:54.300
Go go go go go

48
00:01:55.066 --> 00:01:56.966
Hey, it's out, it's out

49
00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:03.100
Oops, let's send this beautiful ghost first, eh?

50
00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:04.333
From now on

51
00:02:04.333 --> 00:02:06.400
Nameless is the order of this lady
