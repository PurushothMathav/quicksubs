00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:04.400
Don't forget everything

2
00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:12.420
The first rare thing is that it is easy to describe a hero who is good at attacking and tricking people.

3
00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:15.230
You can feel it after just two sentences

4
00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:18.290
He will face thousands of troops alone,

5
00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:23.530
Ten thousand heroes are worth tens of millions.

6
00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:27.290
As expected of him.

7
00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:30.250
General Lee. As a soldier, you

8
00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:31.690
How does it feel?

9
00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:33.630
I would think

10
00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.220
Not bad

11
00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:37.380
acute symptoms

12
00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:38.500
Not enough to eat

13
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:39.580
Not enough to eat

14
00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:42.650
Hit me, my dear lady!

15
00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:44.190
It seems five seconds

16
00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.470
Twice as much as the lady

17
00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:46.850
It feels like falling

18
00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:48.150
Those two sentences are actually slow.

19
00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:49.410
Can't even listen to me

20
00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:57.210
No need to put too much pressure

21
00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:00.070
If you think so, then I will

22
00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:03.600
Just make a song and try it

23
00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:06.600
I talked about releasing a new drama collection

24
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.540
How should we deal with this evil situation?

25
00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.040
If I were you

26
00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:13.580
Give up now I admit it

27
00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:15.660
There are famous experts on the topic of base

28
00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:18.240
But compared to me in doing things

29
00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.700
Still there

30
00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.440
If you can surpass me

31
00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:23.660
I'll give you my real name in this matter

32
00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:25.580
It's really what you said

33
00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:27.200
Listen to me, you two
