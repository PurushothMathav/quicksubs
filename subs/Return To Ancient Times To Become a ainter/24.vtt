00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:07.250
How is that possible? Lao Chen,

2
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:10.820
Your Majesty, since our shoes are compatible,

3
00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:12.840
According to the method of your first shoe, my dear,

4
00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:15.520
Are we also related by blood?

5
00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.040
This name has nothing to do with you. That's right,

6
00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:21.760
Since we are not related by blood,

7
00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:22.940
But the shoes are wild.

8
00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.400
Then it can be proved now,

9
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.700
I have no relationship with this mother and son?

10
00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:32.950
Possible, how could it be compatible?

11
00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:35.950
The first shoe, my dear, is simply not an advisable method.

12
00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.980
There is no distinction between high and low in human blood.

13
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.400
There are only blood types.

14
00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.100
Forget it, Iâ€™ll tell you that I donâ€™t understand it.

15
00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:43.280
You just need to remember

16
00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.760
As long as people have the same blood type

17
00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:46.940
Blood can be planted

18
00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.300
Low-blooded people see it for themselves and it is wrong

19
00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:51.520
We lied to each other for a thousand years

20
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.620
So the two of them

21
00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:56.580
Itâ€™s really not five thousand, of course now

22
00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:00.780
Come and settle our debts with Ichigo.

23
00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.180
They are your eyes

24
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.379
You need to be under strict protection if you don't stay here.

25
00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:06.560
You are blood relatives

26
00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.580
How could it be for someone else?

27
00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.760
I have died in the forest and still donâ€™t know the feeling of despair

28
00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:12.320
Listen to me

29
00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.380
I will give you one last chance

30
00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:17.630
Eat you all the way here and come out with me

31
00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:18.490
I'm hurt

32
00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.140
We have unlimited doors

33
00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:25.020
I don't pay attention to saving lives

34
00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:27.890
I said I said
