1
00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:01.670
you are in danger,

2
00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:03.310
I'll tell you the truth,

3
00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:06.010
Your forces are now dispersed, and I,

4
00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:07.590
But I can read the scriptures directly,

5
00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:10.770
If I don't say it in a month, I will be able to achieve military success.

6
00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:13.590
By the time your rescue comes, it will be too late,

7
00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.610
You know, this is Empress Huang of the Shang Kingdom.

8
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.780
I am so civilized that it would be better to meet in person,

9
00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:25.110
But she is a beauty. At this age, she can't compete with you.

10
00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:28.800
That’s what I said about the daughter of my dear country,

11
00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:31.680
Coach, yes, Zuzu,

12
00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:33.560
Are you really not afraid of Zu?

13
00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:34.660
You, I am, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you ,you,you,you,you,you,you,you,you,you,you,you,you,you,you,you,

14
00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:37.340
There is an emperor who died in battle

15
00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:39.460
No secret thoughts about waiting for the emperor

16
00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:40.720
That means there's no point in talking about it

17
00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:41.830
go home

18
00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:43.290
This child is disobedient and will get sick

19
00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:47.670
It'll be fine if you hit it

20
00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:53.080
As long as you give this time to mobilize the army, you will be afraid of him this time

21
00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:54.310
What’s the high line for Brother Wang?

22
00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:56.230
What are the conditions for respecting the country?

23
00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.980
And the banbu that hurts the country is as good as my respect for the country

24
00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.400
The royal family that hurts the country must be moved to our country.

25
00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:04.420
I, Jingguo, can give you a position

26
00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:06.180
You watch the sky above the shadow of a piece of earth

27
00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:08.030
Let me really think about it

28
00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:10.500
Take these few days seriously

29
00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:13.490
days, months, months

30
00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:14.990
What's your name?

31
00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:18.740
Then how many days do you need, half a month and half a month?

32
00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:20.540
Although not all troops can be mobilized

33
00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:22.230
Mobilize 100,000 people

34
00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:23.010
Withdraw one person

35
00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:24.820
Ten thousand people can resist it

36
00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.140
If you pounce first, you will be defeated.

37
00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:32.790
Arrange your time to rest immediately

38
00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.650
I think this location is good. Come on down.
