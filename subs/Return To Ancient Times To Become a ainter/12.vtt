00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.280
After decades of war,

2
00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:05.700
Leading to destruction first in the fire,

3
00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:07.620
Only Gu Shanghupi is left,

4
00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.480
This is consistent with the process of merely recognizing no rights,

5
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.200
How could he be so angry with a young boy?

6
00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:14.890
Old man Ma has seen enough,

7
00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:17.670
I must see what is missing,

8
00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:20.830
Our reborn eyes make it impossible for the reborn to make an evaluation,

9
00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.090
Why do you want to take a look at it?

10
00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:30.930
It’s not a good idea to follow Wu Kao,

11
00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:32.850
This kid can't even think of Feng Shui.

12
00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.700
Just press it down,

13
00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.900
How is it possible, for a young boy,

14
00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:45.200
It's actually better than a new life.

15
00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:03.920
I said not to say good friends

16
00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:05.019
Don't forget to be nice

17
00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:07.760
You read that right, I’m talking about Sun Changxun

18
00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:09.880
What good things do you have now?

19
00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:16.740
It's good to think of a way

20
00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:18.340
But the general

21
00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:20.180
did you forget

22
00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.160
What about the priesthood you just held?

23
00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:25.930
But there is another test, yes

24
00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:28.090
Want to be the husband of a princess

25
00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:29.710
Not that simple

26
00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.360
You have to do things to live me

27
00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.020
It is only responsible

28
00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:36.780
I see you two

29
00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.800
It's this Meng Xing who won't let me follow the rules

30
00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:41.720
You are almost wrong

31
00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:45.240
This is really His Majesty's man

32
00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:48.440
I'm fine, I'm out

33
00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:49.440
You said to inform my mouth

34
00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:50.620
No need to die

35
00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:52.850
But this is obviously going to be difficult.

36
00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:54.270
I don't even answer this
