00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.780
New ones added here.

2
00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:07.560
What did Her Royal Highness say?

3
00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.120
If you have long ears, go and eat it. My family didn't want to give you one.

4
00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:12.780
Where did this yellow-mouthed child come from?

5
00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:14.920
Do you know who I am?

6
00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:16.560
Even if you talk to me in this tone.

7
00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:20.600
I'm looking for death. Then you kill me and try to make some for everyone.

8
00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:24.290
Let me see what the husband who killed the princess would look like.

9
00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:29.640
This main book?

10
00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.410
He killed.

11
00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.970
Change it. Don't let the job changer ask.

12
00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:35.750
Passed. But really.

13
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.380
That's because I want to see someone killed.

14
00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:40.000
Why isn't this much?

15
00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:42.600
Her Royal Highness the Princess

16
00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.640
Is he your breath

17
00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.120
Can return two books

18
00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.760
He is my breath going like this

19
00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:50.480
He is now the owner of the book

20
00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.340
Dare to be like me and pay the price

21
00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:54.120
Obviously there are two rounds per unit

22
00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.440
I dare to inquire and see if it is called

23
00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:56.620
Broken window grill

24
00:00:58.380 --> 00:00:59.160
You are very good at this

25
00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:02.560
I lost the day, I lost the victory

26
00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:04.200
How could he forget it?

27
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:05.580
Don't you want to kill me?

28
00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:06.180
help my life

29
00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.580
Kill you and defeat you? You guys?

30
00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:15.100
You guys are just so rude and rude.

31
00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:17.410
It'll be fine if you don't

32
00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:19.910
This is how beautiful soft rice feels

33
00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:21.220
His Highness the Red Bull

34
00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:24.020
We are here today

35
00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:27.080
Not here to see Naoji.

36
00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:28.150
Feeling meaning

37
00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:31.840
If the red master doesn’t plan for this style, then that’s fine

38
00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.860
Then take out the oven box

39
00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:36.640
Let me fight it out. Do you want to see it?

40
00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:37.900
I'll show you
