00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:05.880
I see,

2
00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:07.540
Don't be too long, sit tight.

3
00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:10.800
Sit down, now I have a regiment with 300,000 soldiers,

4
00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:13.300
The forces we can spare are limited,

5
00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:15.020
We also need to encourage other regions,

6
00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:16.780
The maximum number of troops it can handle is 300,000.

7
00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:18.470
Three hundred thousand, that's enough,

8
00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:20.910
Three hundred thousand to two hundred thousand,

9
00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.500
It's me again,

10
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.360
In what age are we still waiting for traditional war?

11
00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:27.070
Don't be long, do you have any instructions?

12
00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.690
You are so handsome now,

13
00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:32.940
Give the order, the heavy general is the regimental order,

14
00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.570
Three hundred thousand, fighting to the death,

15
00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:37.150
Only half, the story,

16
00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.990
I will give it to you,

17
00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:41.670
Death, Zhushuai, did you say something wrong just now?

18
00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:43.830
That's right, there's a fight to the death nearby,

19
00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:44.170
Down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down.

20
00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:45.570
The same goes for the soldiers behind me

21
00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.160
Only defeat is allowed and no survivors are allowed

22
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:48.920
What kind of fight did he lose?

23
00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:50.700
This is worse than nonsense

24
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:51.600
line command

25
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.220
I can't break up if I lose

26
00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:54.660
And this is the ear nature

27
00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:57.540
Why did you withdraw from the war, General?

28
00:00:58.460 --> 00:00:59.380
You can even say that you want to go to Wuming

29
00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:00.880
Now he is a handsome dog

30
00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:02.790
what he said

31
00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:03.910
It's a military order

32
00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:05.830
Military orders are like mountains

33
00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:09.720
And why don't we give the anti-military order? I don't dare

34
00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:10.540
I don't even dare to me

35
00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:11.340
The military commander ordered

36
00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:12.560
from now on

37
00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:13.540
The first stop in Qiubei

38
00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:15.230
The first stop must be Hongda

39
00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:16.690
Directly march into the wounded country

40
00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:18.110
Ask as a foreign assistant

41
00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:19.910
Leading the wounded country's army into battle

42
00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:22.040
The first battle must be fought by me

43
00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:23.480
Captured and defeated in battle

44
00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:25.480
I will go back to Baili directly after paying my respects.

45
00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.440
Add plum grass as a combatant

46
00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:31.130
Don’t hurt anyone who worships the queen with plum blossoms and grass.

47
00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.500
I don’t want any plum grass.

48
00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.350
Don't talk about the second side

49
00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:36.030
I'm waiting for an order but don't hand it over.
