00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:02.480
I'm afraid I can't see it anymore.

2
00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:04.440
No, unknown.

3
00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:06.640
You are being followed. impossible.

4
00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:07.880
I'm obviously very careful.

5
00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:10.500
careful. You are indeed a master in front of me.

6
00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:11.740
But in front of Tiefitu.

7
00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:14.590
Very slightly, very feeling.

8
00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.070
Trapped. To his courage.

9
00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:17.770
This guy dares to send someone to follow him and kill him for fun.

10
00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:19.390
Even if we don’t see enough, there’s a problem

11
00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:21.070
What did Bo'er think you were?

12
00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:22.910
It turns out to be a rat among the dogs in the epidemic area

13
00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:24.590
Epidemic potential and Thanos

14
00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.880
Is it difficult for you to know our identity?

15
00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:28.340
Tell me yourself that you are tired

16
00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:29.560
Did I tell you that?

17
00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:31.880
When you talk to me about the first house

18
00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.140
I'm just guessing about your body

19
00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.580
Among them, I guess you are a subordinate of several princes.

20
00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:38.800
But I just met with several princes

21
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.100
And everyone is so happy

22
00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:41.780
We have discussed the matter of the first house

23
00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:43.440
But that's what you said

24
00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:44.800
Prove you don't know

25
00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.000
I also tried it

26
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.140
You are indeed not allowed

27
00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:48.400
So you don’t dare to lose

28
00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.240
He's not from any of the princes

29
00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:51.940
I want to bring chaos to the Qing Dynasty again

30
00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.500
The answer is already obvious

31
00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.460
I can't think of thousands of people

32
00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:58.460
Even if you guessed me, mine

33
00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:00.040
Just giving you a chance

34
00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:01.260
Ingredients thought

35
00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.480
I'll wait for you to do this

36
00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:03.680
You will also learn and grow up

37
00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.080
Tell me how to use it again.

38
00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:06.320
molecular words

39
00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.140
Don't ever think about seeing me again

40
00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:09.080
Then you kill the TV
