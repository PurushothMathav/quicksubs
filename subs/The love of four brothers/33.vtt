00:00:02.733 --> 00:00:04.866
Is this your congratulatory gift?

2
00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.033
Sister, is this the painting you sent?

3
00:00:08.166 --> 00:00:10.100
What a good moral

4
00:00:10.166 --> 00:00:12.033
The Millennium King 80,000 Years

5
00:00:12.166 --> 00:00:14.766
This is really a Chinese grandfather who is immortal

6
00:00:14.766 --> 00:00:17.433
Besides, it stinks and it's distressing

7
00:00:17.966 --> 00:00:21.066
Shen An, that's all you can do

8
00:00:21.266 --> 00:00:22.066
Brother Mu Nian

9
00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:23.666
Don't blame my sister.

10
00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:27.300
I think my sister also wants flowers

11
00:00:27.333 --> 00:00:29.433
But I really don't have that ability

12
00:00:30.766 --> 00:00:31.600
explain

13
00:00:33.133 --> 00:00:35.200
I've been out for so long

14
00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.100
Who do you need to explain to?

15
00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:41.833
Bo Lao

16
00:00:42.533 --> 00:00:44.800
There may be some misunderstanding.

17
00:00:44.866 --> 00:00:46.900
Huanhuan, it's a gift from Songhe

18
00:00:46.933 --> 00:00:48.900
I don't know how it became like this

19
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.033
Yes, Bo Lao

20
00:00:50.266 --> 00:00:52.966
There must be some misunderstanding

21
00:00:55.966 --> 00:00:58.166
Little flower this is

22
00:00:58.600 --> 00:00:59.366
Your ghost hospital

23
00:00:59.366 --> 00:01:00.233
Explain

24
00:01:01.266 --> 00:01:03.133
This painting is not mine

25
00:01:03.133 --> 00:01:05.166
Mine was picked up and switched

26
00:01:05.533 --> 00:01:07.866
This is clearly what you took out yourself

27
00:01:08.266 --> 00:01:10.166
You were all watching it just now

28
00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.266
Why do you say it's not yours?

29
00:01:12.466 --> 00:01:13.633
Why?

30
00:01:13.766 --> 00:01:16.633
Just because I'm the Xiuzuzi you just said
