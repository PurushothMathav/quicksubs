1
00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:02.866
Next is the last item of this auction

2
00:00:02.866 --> 00:00:04.600
Ancient hosta from thousands of years ago

3
00:00:04.666 --> 00:00:06.500
Starting price 5 million

4
00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:09.466
Boss, this is the collection of the mixing pot to be photographed.

5
00:00:09.466 --> 00:00:10.833
Dragon fruit used to be

6
00:00:10.866 --> 00:00:13.766
This time it must never fall into the hands of the stirrer again

7
00:00:13.766 --> 00:00:15.200
I give 10 million

8
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:17.600
I like this hosta very much.

9
00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:21.900
I'm going to take a picture of it for my teeth

10
00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.566
Hahahaha

11
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.900
This happens to be a bit too arrogant with foreign names, right?

12
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:28.366
Hundreds of years ago, we came to our Dragon Kingdom to steal things

13
00:00:28.366 --> 00:00:31.800
Now the house is up for auction again

14
00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.233
If you let him take a picture

15
00:00:34.266 --> 00:00:35.900
Where do we dragon people's faces go?

16
00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:37.166
I'll give you 100 million.

17
00:00:37.533 --> 00:00:39.866
When is a small foot basin garbage?

18
00:00:39.866 --> 00:00:42.066
Dare to clamor on my dragon fruit's territory

19
00:00:42.733 --> 00:00:44.866
Why haven't you been beaten up yet?

20
00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:47.966
A dragon dog

21
00:00:47.966 --> 00:00:49.766
What right do you have to talk to me about Pangu?

22
00:00:49.766 --> 00:00:52.700
One hundred and fifty million

23
00:00:52.933 --> 00:00:55.166
I urge everyone here

24
00:00:55.166 --> 00:00:57.400
Think carefully before picking up the pie.

25
00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.966
After all, the implementer is Junqi

26
00:01:02.333 --> 00:01:03.366
Three billion.

27
00:01:05.166 --> 00:01:07.400
Luo Shao, what 5 million list?

28
00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.766
Isn't it a bit too out of company to give 300 million?

29
00:01:09.966 --> 00:01:11.133
I have money

30
00:01:11.133 --> 00:01:13.566
This ancient disaster concerns my face if

31
00:01:13.566 --> 00:01:14.500
Never lose

32
00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:16.900
Damn dragon kingdom blood dog

33
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.166
I am just a garden

34
00:01:18.166 --> 00:01:21.400
You can't get what you want yet.

35
00:01:21.533 --> 00:01:24.400
350 million, 500 million.
