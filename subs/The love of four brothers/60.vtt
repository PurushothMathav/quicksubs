00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:02.633
Lu Qikuan, you little wave hoof, get out for me

2
00:00:05.366 --> 00:00:06.466
What about Lu Qikuan?

3
00:00:06.766 --> 00:00:07.966
Immediately let you white-eyed wolf

4
00:00:07.966 --> 00:00:09.266
Roll in front of me

5
00:00:09.266 --> 00:00:10.933
What do the security guards at the door do?

6
00:00:10.933 --> 00:00:12.466
Why does everyone come in?

7
00:00:12.733 --> 00:00:14.066
Humph mom and dad

8
00:00:14.066 --> 00:00:15.466
I am An An

9
00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:18.200
We lived together for 18 years

10
00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:19.833
Now I want to come back

11
00:00:19.933 --> 00:00:21.566
Please let me come back

12
00:00:21.566 --> 00:00:23.900
It was you who wanted to go back to the Shen family

13
00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:26.433
Now the Shen family has fallen and wants to come back

14
00:00:26.933 --> 00:00:28.400
What to daydream about

15
00:00:28.666 --> 00:00:29.466
So...

16
00:00:29.666 --> 00:00:32.166
You don't want me back because of him, right?

17
00:00:33.366 --> 00:00:34.466
It must be this bitch

18
00:00:34.466 --> 00:00:37.000
What pillow wind is blowing in your ears?

19
00:00:37.066 --> 00:00:39.866
We have lived together for 18 years

20
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.433
Are these feelings fake?

21
00:00:42.933 --> 00:00:44.633
You may not believe it

22
00:00:45.266 --> 00:00:47.100
He's already a broken shoe

23
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.833
Does a woman like him deserve a down payment?

24
00:00:50.966 --> 00:00:53.600
If you don't listen, I advise you to achieve something.

25
00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.266
Change it now

26
00:00:55.933 --> 00:00:57.400
Maybe I'm in a good mood

27
00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.066
You can also tell me about the fact that you were slept with by a wild man two years ago

28
00:01:00.066 --> 00:01:01.266
Bury it

29
00:01:03.066 --> 00:01:04.266
How do you know?

30
00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:05.933
This thing

31
00:01:05.933 --> 00:01:07.300
If you get stabbed in

32
00:01:07.866 --> 00:01:10.100
How long will your vineyard last?

33
00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.200
Sister, just treat it as a replacement to meet.

34
00:01:16.566 --> 00:01:19.600
If you are not obedient, why don't you tell your parents quickly?

35
00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.566
Who is that wild man of yours?

36
00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.033
Hello, let your parents lose your company

37
00:01:24.533 --> 00:01:27.066
Forget it, I'm a beggar too

38
00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:29.566
Me.

39
00:01:31.666 --> 00:01:33.233
That man is me
