00:00:08.933 --> 00:00:11.500
Brother Nian, since I chased you, I came here

2
00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:13.900
I just wanted to teach him a lesson

3
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:15.866
Put yourself away

4
00:00:17.333 --> 00:00:19.333
If you dare to bully my unmarried grace again

5
00:00:19.333 --> 00:00:20.966
Don't blame me for showing you no mercy.

6
00:00:20.966 --> 00:00:23.866
Brother Ning, I am your sweetheart

7
00:00:24.933 --> 00:00:26.533
You forgot this bracelet.

8
00:00:26.533 --> 00:00:29.500
Do you know if this bracelet is yours?

9
00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:30.700
If you dare to lie to me

10
00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:32.600
I make you regret trying here

11
00:00:38.066 --> 00:00:39.700
The Buddha is really fickle

12
00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:42.933
Some time ago, I loved Shen Anan and loved to death

13
00:00:42.933 --> 00:00:45.066
Gu Xiwu, your grandfather also retreated

14
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.000
Now it seems like a different person

15
00:00:50.366 --> 00:00:52.966
Miss Lu has so many secrets that make me curious

16
00:00:53.066 --> 00:00:55.233
How can I still have the heart to break the marriage?

17
00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:56.900
What a pity!

18
00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:59.900
This marriage

19
00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:15.333
Did Miss Lu sit in the wrong seat?

20
00:01:15.333 --> 00:01:17.066
If I remember correctly

21
00:01:17.066 --> 00:01:18.800
This position should be block girl

22
00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.933
There are only three seats in the first row of the awards show

23
00:01:36.933 --> 00:01:38.300
One is to be more ruthless to Mu Ning

24
00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:39.600
One is for the organizers

25
00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.500
The last one is about leveling me.

26
00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.066
How dare you be in the first row

27
00:01:43.066 --> 00:01:45.500
I'd love to. Can you handle it?

28
00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:46.866
Wrong location is wrong

29
00:01:46.866 --> 00:01:48.666
Don't mess with what your mother gave you

30
00:01:48.666 --> 00:01:51.066
That's not something you can afford.

31
00:01:52.333 --> 00:01:55.700
I'm sitting in my own seat and I need to report to you
