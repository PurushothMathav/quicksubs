1
00:00:01.566 --> 00:00:04.366
How can you come?

2
00:00:04.466 --> 00:00:05.633
I've decided.

3
00:00:06.066 --> 00:00:08.066
Here is the Best Actor's press conference

4
00:00:08.366 --> 00:00:10.866
They are all bosses in the film and television industry

5
00:00:10.933 --> 00:00:12.300
What are you?

6
00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.600
You think you are lucky to buy the same mask.

7
00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:17.266
Can you impersonate him?

8
00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.000
He's a cannibal.

9
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.100
Shameless

10
00:00:20.266 --> 00:00:20.666
how

11
00:00:20.666 --> 00:00:23.300
Now anyone can attend our dinner party.

12
00:00:23.533 --> 00:00:25.300
It turns out that in your eyes

13
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.833
My weird and handsome identity as a female of Dragon Country

14
00:00:28.966 --> 00:00:31.466
Isn't it enough for this conference?

15
00:00:31.533 --> 00:00:34.400
If you know some medical skills, you will say that you are a ghost doctor

16
00:00:34.966 --> 00:00:37.100
If you can fight, say you are a handsome woman

17
00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.633
Who can prove that you are?

18
00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.700
Why are you so thick-skinned?

19
00:00:42.366 --> 00:00:43.800
What do you think?

20
00:00:44.266 --> 00:00:47.466
What identity should I be in?

21
00:00:48.366 --> 00:00:52.400
Of course young people like Ms. Lucky

22
00:00:52.766 --> 00:00:53.833
That estimate

23
00:00:54.333 --> 00:00:56.633
She is also the sister-in-law Huang Lian who has the invitation letter.

24
00:00:58.066 --> 00:00:59.600
You look like this.

25
00:01:00.733 --> 00:01:02.033
Do you have an invitation letter?

26
00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:06.800
Film launch

27
00:01:06.966 --> 00:01:08.500
I'd like to see it

28
00:01:08.666 --> 00:01:11.400
Where did you conjure up invitations out of thin air?

29
00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:16.300
Only one invitation can be entered.

30
00:01:16.766 --> 00:01:18.300
I see what's wrong with you

31
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.000
Security guard

32
00:01:23.133 --> 00:01:24.066
How come?

33
00:01:24.533 --> 00:01:26.000
This person doesn't have an invitation.

34
00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:27.866
And paranoid about getting in

35
00:01:28.166 --> 00:01:31.266
I think it's either illegitimate or dog slaughtered.

36
00:01:32.066 --> 00:01:33.466
For the safety of the introduction

37
00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.600
Kicked me out of the house

38
00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.900
I never thought I was a real person

39
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.966
Could it be that it's really a fake?

40
00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:45.800
Who said I didn't ask for it?
