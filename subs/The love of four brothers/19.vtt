00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:02.000
This should be the first time our house is so neat and tidy

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:02.966
All right?

3
00:00:10.066 --> 00:00:11.700
Mom and Dad

4
00:00:11.733 --> 00:00:13.766
Brothers, I'm full

5
00:00:13.766 --> 00:00:15.566
I'll go out first

6
00:00:18.533 --> 00:00:21.266
Fourth brother, borrow your little electric donkey

7
00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:22.900
Little sister is in a hurry

8
00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:23.866
Where are we going?

9
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.866
Didn't you go to the Doctor Group to find me and settle the bill with you?

10
00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:27.766
Hmm what

11
00:00:30.733 --> 00:00:34.300
I just saw him search for the Doctor Group.

12
00:00:40.533 --> 00:00:41.400
Grandpa

13
00:00:41.666 --> 00:00:44.033
I said I'm not interested in Lu Kyung-hwan

14
00:00:45.866 --> 00:00:46.900
You killed me

15
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.366
This marriage must be annulled

16
00:00:48.866 --> 00:00:50.500
Can't mix things up

17
00:00:52.566 --> 00:00:54.200
Hey, deer!

18
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.766
Don't worry, I've taught this brat a lesson

19
00:00:56.766 --> 00:01:00.600
What did you say my granddaughter-in-law is going to get a doctor?

20
00:01:00.866 --> 00:01:03.366
Okay, I'll arrange it.

21
00:01:03.766 --> 00:01:04.966
What are you still doing?

22
00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:06.566
Hurry up and order

23
00:01:06.766 --> 00:01:08.033
Future young lady

24
00:01:08.533 --> 00:01:09.733
To go to the company for inspection

25
00:01:09.733 --> 00:01:11.133
If anyone rips him off

26
00:01:11.133 --> 00:01:12.766
Be careful I peel his skin

27
00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:27.900
OK

28
00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:29.500
Pair 2

29
00:01:30.166 --> 00:01:32.000
Oops, what do you want?

30
00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:38.600
What do you mean that the young lady is coming to the company?

31
00:01:38.866 --> 00:01:40.033
Young grandma

32
00:01:41.366 --> 00:01:42.966
If Mr. and Mrs. Eight

33
00:01:42.966 --> 00:01:44.900
I'm sure a promotion is in sight.

34
00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.300
Come on, come on, come downstairs with me, grandma

35
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:50.900
Eyes are cheap

36
00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:53.233
When you meet the young lady, remember to behave well

37
00:01:54.066 --> 00:01:55.800
Why haven't you come yet?

38
00:02:06.066 --> 00:02:09.166
It's just that I've seen the young lady
