00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:01.250
Your brother

2
00:00:02.666 --> 00:00:06.083
Song Feng, it turns out that you are Song Feng's younger brother

3
00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.300
Yes, I did.

4
00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:10.250
Who made him as dead-headed as you?

5
00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:12.166
You have to solve the case

6
00:00:12.183 --> 00:00:13.300
blame yourself

7
00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:15.766
You go to great lengths to get the words of joy and injustice

8
00:00:17.033 --> 00:00:20.683
You know our secret, hahahaha, that's right.

9
00:00:21.066 --> 00:00:22.150
This Book

10
00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:24.700
You can get what you want.

11
00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:26.533
But my brother is so smart.

12
00:00:26.666 --> 00:00:29.400
How can you do it alone?

13
00:00:29.983 --> 00:00:33.600
There are other people behind the scenes who are hard to say

14
00:00:34.033 --> 00:00:36.400
At that time, I and um

15
00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:38.433
You're trying to trick me

16
00:00:38.433 --> 00:00:40.566
Is it done? I guessed right.

17
00:00:41.466 --> 00:00:44.200
You've been tricked like everyone else

18
00:00:44.833 --> 00:00:46.733
Don't dare to say it.

19
00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:48.566
What do you mean?

20
00:00:48.633 --> 00:00:49.650
I guess.

21
00:00:50.433 --> 00:00:51.833
Everyone knows about it.

22
00:00:51.833 --> 00:00:53.933
People who are in love are scared

23
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.583
Although you are only one of the masterminds behind the scenes

24
00:00:56.583 --> 00:00:58.283
But also just a lackey

25
00:00:58.633 --> 00:01:00.800
You want to save yourself with the washing aid road?

26
00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:03.250
Anton tells the truth

27
00:01:03.466 --> 00:01:05.600
I will avenge you.

28
00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:07.683
I'll kill you!
