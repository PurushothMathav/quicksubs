00:00:01.616 --> 00:00:02.416
Dragon Lao

2
00:00:03.133 --> 00:00:04.433
How's it going?

3
00:00:05.783 --> 00:00:06.716
suffocation

4
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:08.700
No signs of a fight

5
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.283
The room is not open either.

6
00:00:10.816 --> 00:00:11.833
Timed suicide

7
00:00:12.216 --> 00:00:14.300
Last month, two brides committed suicide

8
00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:16.500
The moon is too expensive again

9
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.000
It's still on the town

10
00:00:18.733 --> 00:00:20.533
This scared the people to death

11
00:00:20.533 --> 00:00:21.716
That's not possible.

12
00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.883
How could my daughter commit suicide on her wedding night?

13
00:00:24.983 --> 00:00:27.800
The old man said that suicide is suicide

14
00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.516
Hurry up and come to the aftermath, wait a minute

15
00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:37.600
Your daughter didn't commit suicide

16
00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:40.150
But murder murder

17
00:00:45.216 --> 00:00:47.333
Humph where did the kid come from

18
00:00:47.333 --> 00:00:50.716
You dare to question the judgment of my gold medal five dragon kings

19
00:00:50.816 --> 00:00:52.016
Destroyed the scene

20
00:00:52.016 --> 00:00:53.950
Do you take up this responsibility?

21
00:00:54.133 --> 00:00:57.283
Somebody insert it for me, don't be rude

22
00:00:58.183 --> 00:01:01.483
These are the five masters who saved my life

23
00:01:01.783 --> 00:01:03.033
Who dares to be unreasonable?

24
00:01:03.616 --> 00:01:04.416
Do not do

25
00:01:05.416 --> 00:01:06.816
The old man has 5 seats vertically and horizontally

26
00:01:06.816 --> 00:01:08.016
exploration tree

27
00:01:08.016 --> 00:01:09.133
no rival

28
00:01:09.133 --> 00:01:12.483
You are a yellow-mouthed boy, please comment Yes Miss

29
00:01:13.783 --> 00:01:15.800
How dare you be a corpse

30
00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:17.516
But

31
00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.483
The person who fiddles with the corpse will use the corpse to deceive you

32
00:01:21.933 --> 00:01:24.816
Paper media is easy to break

33
00:01:24.816 --> 00:01:26.633
Can also give you a clue

34
00:01:27.016 --> 00:01:29.883
Hahaha, it's ridiculous.

35
00:01:30.183 --> 00:01:31.633
Oh, Song Xueyue

36
00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:33.883
I know you are capable

37
00:01:34.216 --> 00:01:37.200
But this old dragon is also an expert I invited

38
00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:39.083
Already unfathomable

39
00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:40.750
Marshal

40
00:01:41.333 --> 00:01:42.133
let

41
00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:43.916
I'd like to see it

42
00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.050
Splendid kid

43
00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:48.583
How to overthrow the old man's Chrysostom

44
00:01:48.583 --> 00:01:51.333
Then if I can prove he murdered

45
00:01:51.333 --> 00:01:54.283
The old man knelt down and called you grandpa
