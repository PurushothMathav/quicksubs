00:00:01.016 --> 00:00:02.616
Go away you all go away

2
00:00:02.616 --> 00:00:05.366
Don't come over 36 little girl

3
00:00:05.383 --> 00:00:06.800
I am Su Yuehan

4
00:00:06.816 --> 00:00:08.333
Don't you know me?

5
00:00:08.333 --> 00:00:10.300
Fake is fake

6
00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:13.066
Why did you make me go away

7
00:00:13.066 --> 00:00:15.483
Sister, think of a way.

8
00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.633
That's pretty rare.

9
00:00:17.816 --> 00:00:20.516
Please lend me your body first.

10
00:00:27.066 --> 00:00:28.383
Sure enough

11
00:00:28.383 --> 00:00:30.666
Every time this kid is in trouble

12
00:00:30.666 --> 00:00:33.266
It will be as cost-effective as a fairy guide.

13
00:00:33.266 --> 00:00:35.983
It seems that the guess should be correct

14
00:00:35.983 --> 00:00:37.000
Let me ask

15
00:00:37.333 --> 00:00:39.016
When does the lady usually go crazy?

16
00:00:39.016 --> 00:00:40.933
Every day at dawn

17
00:00:40.933 --> 00:00:42.483
Then wait until dawn

18
00:00:42.866 --> 00:00:44.166
I want to see the whole process

19
00:00:46.216 --> 00:00:47.633
I don't believe it anymore

20
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.683
There are cases I can't solve

21
00:00:51.216 --> 00:00:54.033
Daughter-in-law, I have something to discuss with you.

22
00:00:54.583 --> 00:00:57.116
But please don't be angry.

23
00:00:57.133 --> 00:00:58.183
So what's up?

24
00:00:58.183 --> 00:01:00.966
I suspect the previous cases

25
00:01:01.216 --> 00:01:03.416
Someone else is behind the scenes

26
00:01:03.416 --> 00:01:04.683
Behind the scenes

27
00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:06.800
Didn't the cold winter die together?

28
00:01:06.866 --> 00:01:09.333
Bitter Winter compared to these few masterminds behind the scenes

29
00:01:09.333 --> 00:01:10.933
Maybe a small role

30
00:01:10.933 --> 00:01:13.033
Even he is a scapegoat

31
00:01:13.183 --> 00:01:14.516
I think

32
00:01:15.266 --> 00:01:16.833
Dad is a little suspicious

33
00:01:16.933 --> 00:01:18.200
What are you talking about?

34
00:01:18.266 --> 00:01:20.800
How can you say that to my father?

35
00:01:21.383 --> 00:01:23.400
My father is a little bit lustful

36
00:01:23.983 --> 00:01:26.366
But he has protected the city and its people for so many years

37
00:01:26.733 --> 00:01:28.100
You are not allowed to say that to him

38
00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.166
I didn't say he was a murderer

39
00:01:30.533 --> 00:01:33.300
But according to the current clues

40
00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:35.783
This person must be a very powerful person

41
00:01:35.783 --> 00:01:38.200
And access to my brother and your people

42
00:01:40.733 --> 00:01:43.916
You also know that Dad's health is not good

43
00:01:44.133 --> 00:01:46.033
I was worried that he would go astray.

44
00:01:46.416 --> 00:01:47.416
Hey, you said

45
00:01:47.416 --> 00:01:48.300
You say it again

46
00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:51.233
Screw your ears up, don't say it, don't say it hurts
