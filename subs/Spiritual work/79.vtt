00:00:00.533 --> 00:00:01.333
Ah!

2
00:00:01.766 --> 00:00:03.666
Oh, no.

3
00:00:03.733 --> 00:00:04.716
I didn't say anything.

4
00:00:05.366 --> 00:00:06.350
Nope.

5
00:00:07.283 --> 00:00:11.383
I clearly heard what secret you said.

6
00:00:11.416 --> 00:00:13.116
Uh, I mean

7
00:00:13.216 --> 00:00:14.533
Behind this cold winter

8
00:00:14.533 --> 00:00:17.150
There must be a very big secret

9
00:00:18.016 --> 00:00:18.950
hum

10
00:00:25.966 --> 00:00:29.150
Put the temple in the temple, wish everyone, etc., all on top

11
00:00:29.416 --> 00:00:30.733
Smash God Xiao

12
00:00:30.733 --> 00:00:32.783
The handsome can't smash it.

13
00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:33.933
Offended the bodhisattva

14
00:00:33.933 --> 00:00:35.616
Our children will suffer

15
00:00:35.616 --> 00:00:36.666
Go boy

16
00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:39.283
But there is something wrong with the god you mentioned.

17
00:00:39.283 --> 00:00:40.916
It's okay if you break it open.

18
00:00:40.933 --> 00:00:42.916
I will lose the hearts of the people

19
00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.033
Auntie don't worry

20
00:00:44.133 --> 00:00:45.433
I pledge my life

21
00:00:45.483 --> 00:00:48.116
I am solely responsible for any problems.

22
00:00:48.366 --> 00:00:50.033
Smash this

23
00:00:51.483 --> 00:00:53.433
Can't check, can't check

24
00:00:58.016 --> 00:00:59.733
Report that the commander found nothing

25
00:00:59.733 --> 00:01:01.633
Dashuai Poison Releasing Buddha Statue

26
00:01:01.933 --> 00:01:03.650
The Dragon King is going to sin

27
00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:05.866
Song Xue, what's going on?

28
00:01:07.016 --> 00:01:07.816
i

29
00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:16.066
Don't be afraid

30
00:01:16.283 --> 00:01:18.266
Uncle will protect you.

31
00:01:18.816 --> 00:01:19.616
Say

32
00:01:23.133 --> 00:01:24.633
Ah handsome

33
00:01:24.766 --> 00:01:25.866
There is a problem with demolition

34
00:01:26.416 --> 00:01:28.183
Cowardly

35
00:01:33.483 --> 00:01:34.166
Report to the marshal

36
00:01:34.166 --> 00:01:35.350
Bones, no meat.

37
00:01:35.533 --> 00:01:36.750
Take them away

38
00:01:38.533 --> 00:01:40.133
You murderer

39
00:01:40.133 --> 00:01:41.950
Give back our child, give back my child

40
00:01:42.766 --> 00:01:43.883
No wonder there are so many children

41
00:01:43.883 --> 00:01:44.850
It's been gone for the night

42
00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.350
It turns out that the whole temple is full of thieves, wait a minute

43
00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:51.833
Why are there only child bones and no meat?
