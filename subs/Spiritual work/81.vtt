00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.400
Song Song Eleven

2
00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:03.050
Please save my family

3
00:00:08.233 --> 00:00:10.616
I'll walk with you

4
00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:12.500
It's fine here.

5
00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:13.933
I'll just go alone.

6
00:00:25.033 --> 00:00:25.850
Oh, no.

7
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:28.400
Ah!

8
00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:30.133
sister

9
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.133
There is no way.

10
00:00:35.633 --> 00:00:36.850
It's important

11
00:00:45.233 --> 00:00:46.933
Looking for brother

12
00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:52.266
Sister, don't call me sister

13
00:00:52.266 --> 00:00:53.600
I don't have you as my brother

14
00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.450
You bastard

15
00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:56.650
Calm down.

16
00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.900
Brother Xun is him

17
00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:00.866
It was he who agreed to Bitter Winter's request

18
00:01:00.866 --> 00:01:02.050
Killed your brother

19
00:01:02.666 --> 00:01:05.016
He will kill my parents in the cold winter

20
00:01:05.316 --> 00:01:06.800
Because I was hiding in the closet.

21
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.533
So I narrowly escaped

22
00:01:09.066 --> 00:01:09.916
Sorry sister

23
00:01:09.916 --> 00:01:12.233
I'm sorry, our father and mother can do it.

24
00:01:12.233 --> 00:01:13.166
That's it.

25
00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.700
Get the weather settled first, and then think of countermeasures. Let's go

26
00:01:19.466 --> 00:01:20.716
You are very sick

27
00:01:20.716 --> 00:01:21.733
Just skin trauma

28
00:01:22.116 --> 00:01:23.316
Just put some medicine on it.

29
00:01:23.316 --> 00:01:26.233
I'll go buy it, Song Xun, Lord Song, my sister invited you.

30
00:01:26.233 --> 00:01:28.566
Thank you brother

31
00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.233
Can we get along again?

32
00:01:33.233 --> 00:01:35.933
Hey, hey, don't get me wrong.

33
00:01:36.916 --> 00:01:39.500
You just have a bad conscience

34
00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.733
Miss Su and I are getting married soon

35
00:01:44.033 --> 00:01:46.816
Strange that the pharmacy is downstairs

36
00:01:47.066 --> 00:01:48.616
What took you so long?

37
00:01:50.033 --> 00:01:50.833
not good

38
00:01:52.116 --> 00:01:53.100
primary school

39
00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:55.900
You can't run this time, can you?
