00:00:02.916 --> 00:00:04.133
Big boss

2
00:00:04.466 --> 00:00:05.750
Didn't you just say okay?

3
00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:07.200
Let us go when we're done with the case

4
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.700
What are you doing?

5
00:00:09.433 --> 00:00:12.366
What are you doing?

6
00:00:13.033 --> 00:00:14.616
Open your mouth

7
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.250
Uh-huh.

8
00:00:16.916 --> 00:00:17.716
Ah!

9
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.900
What did you give me to eat?

10
00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:22.450
This is Eating Zen Valley

11
00:00:22.516 --> 00:00:24.550
Let us within twelve hours

12
00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:26.616
Bliss in the Shared World

13
00:00:27.466 --> 00:00:30.533
But if you make the other party unhappy within the time

14
00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:33.416
That would be the opposite.

15
00:00:33.633 --> 00:00:35.766
Unless we never see each other again

16
00:00:36.033 --> 00:00:38.250
Otherwise life is worse than death

17
00:00:40.233 --> 00:00:41.866
Who taught you that?

18
00:00:41.866 --> 00:00:44.100
If you like someone, tie him to the canyon

19
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.033
This is too nasty. I'm a bandit.

20
00:00:47.033 --> 00:00:48.333
What's wrong with nasty

21
00:00:49.316 --> 00:00:51.933
And my mother didn't tell me not to do that.

22
00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:53.850
I only know

23
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.933
I have to fight for what I like.

24
00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.566
Lingering love

25
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.216
Antidote

26
00:01:09.233 --> 00:01:12.766
You are from the Valley of Infatuation

27
00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:16.816
You are mine tonight

28
00:01:17.916 --> 00:01:21.616
Take it easy, it won't hurt.
