00:00:00.516 --> 00:00:01.933
Fuck me

2
00:00:04.083 --> 00:00:04.883
Ah!

3
00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:07.900
Kind of search

4
00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:09.716
If it weren't for a murder

5
00:00:09.716 --> 00:00:11.283
I have to shoot you today

6
00:00:11.283 --> 00:00:14.483
What? A lot of people died last night

7
00:00:14.483 --> 00:00:16.083
The superintendent can't help it.

8
00:00:16.083 --> 00:00:17.083
You can only turn to the commander

9
00:00:17.083 --> 00:00:17.883
search

10
00:00:18.483 --> 00:00:21.416
Either agree to this marriage and ask me to handle the case together

11
00:00:22.033 --> 00:00:23.716
I want to hand over the whole case to you

12
00:00:23.716 --> 00:00:25.583
The case must be solved within three days

13
00:00:26.033 --> 00:00:27.133
Inspector Song ordered

14
00:00:27.483 --> 00:00:29.250
The case must be solved within three days

15
00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:30.333
If it doesn't break

16
00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:31.500
at your disposal

17
00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:33.533
Song patrol

18
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.850
I'm waiting for your good news.

19
00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:37.200
Let's go

20
00:00:37.833 --> 00:00:40.733
Song Xun, why are you so impulsive again?

21
00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:43.033
Did you forget the last time you investigated the case?

22
00:00:43.033 --> 00:00:44.950
Did the cold winter harm you?

23
00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:47.250
Sister-in-law, I am for you

24
00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:49.133
I can't join the Su family

25
00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:51.583
Why bother?

26
00:00:52.683 --> 00:00:54.616
Sister, what should we do first?

27
00:00:55.883 --> 00:00:58.250
Don't you think about it for yourself?

28
00:00:58.433 --> 00:01:01.500
Of course, from the corpse and the crime scene?

29
00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:05.183
I'm right, right, right, right.

30
00:01:05.233 --> 00:01:07.516
I have relied too much on you during this time.

31
00:01:07.516 --> 00:01:09.216
I'm a little confused

32
00:01:09.916 --> 00:01:10.783
Come on.

33
00:01:11.516 --> 00:01:13.050
Matsudo, are you ready?

34
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.016
Junyi, let me ask you something

35
00:01:15.283 --> 00:01:17.183
Where was the body last night?

36
00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:18.716
Just to see the scene

37
00:01:18.716 --> 00:01:20.150
Of course please follow me

38
00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:21.400
I'll go with you.

39
00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.816
Sister-in-law, don't go

40
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.433
This time is likely to be more dangerous than last time

41
00:01:26.433 --> 00:01:28.133
I can't take care of you

42
00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.516
You help me find Xiasu Daqiang

43
00:01:30.516 --> 00:01:32.300
Let him help me

44
00:01:34.116 --> 00:01:34.916
Come on.

45
00:01:41.683 --> 00:01:42.650
Ash

46
00:01:43.083 --> 00:01:46.733
This may be the last time we see each other
