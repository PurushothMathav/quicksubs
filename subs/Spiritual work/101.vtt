00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.166
Don't move.

2
00:00:02.233 --> 00:00:03.933
be honest

3
00:00:04.516 --> 00:00:07.450
Hand over the bones in your body

4
00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:11.250
Don't deny that I let you solve so many cases

5
00:00:11.433 --> 00:00:13.833
Just to make sure he exists

6
00:00:13.833 --> 00:00:17.100
If he doesn't agree with you, you will die here with your sister-in-law

7
00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.250
For an ethereal longevity

8
00:00:20.433 --> 00:00:21.600
You hurt the world

9
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.933
Is it worth it to lie to your daughter?

10
00:00:24.066 --> 00:00:26.933
Bullshit. You've never been in a war

11
00:00:27.033 --> 00:00:31.850
How do you know that you are seriously ill with a heavy soldier in hand?

12
00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:35.300
The pain of not being able to achieve revenge until death

13
00:00:35.833 --> 00:00:39.133
Gu Ling, I know you can hear me

14
00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:41.933
If you want this kid to live

15
00:00:43.316 --> 00:00:47.366
Quickly find out the secrets in the book and tell me

16
00:00:47.716 --> 00:00:49.333
Sister, don't listen to him

17
00:00:49.466 --> 00:00:51.500
Sister, don't listen to him

18
00:00:51.666 --> 00:00:53.133
That's all.

19
00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:57.133
This secret has killed many people

20
00:00:57.433 --> 00:00:59.416
We all want to live forever.

21
00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:03.133
But they all went crazy on this road

22
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.216
Your secret to longevity

23
00:01:08.466 --> 00:01:11.616
Without the last scene, isn't it the soul of knowledge?

24
00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:12.916
I'm right here.

25
00:01:12.916 --> 00:01:14.300
As long as you are willing to release Song Xuan

26
00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.216
I'll tell you a secret about ancient books

27
00:01:24.316 --> 00:01:27.100
Hurry up and find the secrets in the monuments and tell me

28
00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:29.166
Or I'll shoot him
