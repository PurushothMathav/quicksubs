00:00:09.516 --> 00:00:10.483
Don't come over.

2
00:00:10.783 --> 00:00:11.850
Don't come here

3
00:00:12.116 --> 00:00:12.933
I am scum

4
00:00:13.116 --> 00:00:16.150
I don't taste good I'm scum I don't taste good

5
00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:17.933
Don't come here

6
00:00:20.633 --> 00:00:21.433
Ah!

7
00:00:21.983 --> 00:00:24.683
Miss Song, why are you here?

8
00:00:25.033 --> 00:00:26.333
Someone wants to hurt you

9
00:00:26.383 --> 00:00:27.550
Come with me.

10
00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:30.850
I'll have someone take you out of town tomorrow morning, Miss Song

11
00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:33.566
Recent things

12
00:00:33.716 --> 00:00:35.016
I'm so sorry.

13
00:00:35.783 --> 00:00:37.316
It's not that I don't have you in my heart

14
00:00:37.316 --> 00:00:39.266
But at that time, I had someone in my heart

15
00:00:39.266 --> 00:00:40.683
What do you say this for?

16
00:00:40.916 --> 00:00:41.783
Who do you like?

17
00:00:41.783 --> 00:00:44.166
Who you want to be with is your business

18
00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:47.333
I didn't mean that. I'll go.

19
00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.983
I've opened the room, you can sleep here tonight

20
00:00:54.983 --> 00:00:56.450
I'll come back to you tomorrow morning.

21
00:00:56.716 --> 00:00:57.966
Miss Xie Song

22
00:01:07.383 --> 00:01:11.016
Hey, hey, Miss Su, what are you doing?

23
00:01:11.433 --> 00:01:13.316
We are still friends

24
00:01:13.316 --> 00:01:14.466
I am not

25
00:01:14.466 --> 00:01:15.583
I'm not that kind of person.

26
00:01:15.583 --> 00:01:16.933
I am a gentleman

27
00:01:17.866 --> 00:01:20.683
Are all the women who have come back from studying abroad so open?

28
00:01:21.066 --> 00:01:22.616
in good shape

29
00:01:23.033 --> 00:01:25.650
It shouldn't matter if you take a few more glances.

30
00:01:38.583 --> 00:01:39.616
Oh, no.

31
00:01:42.066 --> 00:01:43.933
He must be poisoned

32
00:01:49.983 --> 00:01:51.766
He must be poisoned

33
00:01:52.583 --> 00:01:53.650
No no

34
00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.950
Wait a minute, there are people out there who are killing you

35
00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.650
Are you going out now to unite with death?

36
00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:00.733
What to do then?

37
00:02:01.183 --> 00:02:03.033
The poison letter is about to spread to the heart

38
00:02:03.033 --> 00:02:04.266
Did you watch him die?

39
00:02:04.266 --> 00:02:04.583
But

40
00:02:04.583 --> 00:02:06.916
The nearest hospital is also 5 kilometers away.

41
00:02:06.916 --> 00:02:08.816
When you get there, his body will be cold

42
00:02:10.266 --> 00:02:11.116
Do you remember

43
00:02:11.116 --> 00:02:12.433
The last time you were poisoned

44
00:02:12.433 --> 00:02:13.666
How did you survive?

45
00:02:13.666 --> 00:02:15.683
Are you going to use moisture to fight poison with poison?

46
00:02:16.266 --> 00:02:17.766
But here is not a pile

47
00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:21.083
There is still remnants in it after you absorbed it last time.

48
00:02:21.316 --> 00:02:23.333
Chop him with your mouth

49
00:02:23.866 --> 00:02:26.283
I treated my sister-in-law like that last time.

50
00:02:26.433 --> 00:02:28.766
Don't you care

51
00:02:28.983 --> 00:02:30.150
Miss Song saved me

52
00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.083
I can't just watch him die

53
00:02:32.983 --> 00:02:35.050
I'm sorry, sister-in-law.
