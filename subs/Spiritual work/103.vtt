00:00:00.183 --> 00:00:01.533
Over the years

2
00:00:02.866 --> 00:00:04.933
You wouldn't even go near a dead body

3
00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:06.866
When deep in the field

4
00:00:06.866 --> 00:00:09.200
I'm always anxious and distressed

5
00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:12.850
Fortunately, you saw me in the middle of that life and death

6
00:00:13.583 --> 00:00:15.566
Never you won't

7
00:00:16.583 --> 00:00:18.250
You will always be the one

8
00:00:18.633 --> 00:00:20.200
In my mind

9
00:00:20.833 --> 00:00:23.333
The most talented young genius

10
00:00:24.466 --> 00:00:25.400
That

11
00:00:26.233 --> 00:00:28.083
My favorite person

12
00:00:30.633 --> 00:00:32.650
It was you who taught me 5 prospecting

13
00:00:32.666 --> 00:00:34.250
Let's go together.

14
00:00:35.783 --> 00:00:37.650
Have what you want in your heart

15
00:00:38.666 --> 00:00:39.733
OK

16
00:00:41.833 --> 00:00:42.883
OK

17
00:00:44.466 --> 00:00:45.850
May the world

18
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.800
No more deception and resentment

19
00:00:49.383 --> 00:00:51.400
No more grievances

20
00:00:52.833 --> 00:00:54.733
May I bleed

21
00:00:55.983 --> 00:00:58.133
For me the world

22
00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.533
Apologize and be fearless
