1
00:00:00.833 --> 00:00:03.333
Then I will come to your house in person tomorrow.

2
00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:05.183
Waiting for your good news.

3
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.383
Let's go

4
00:00:09.633 --> 00:00:13.016
Sister, are you really sure that you can solve the case one day?

5
00:00:13.083 --> 00:00:14.533
My uncle Xikou's

6
00:00:14.633 --> 00:00:17.133
Can you see my mood?

7
00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:20.350
Ah sister

8
00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:21.450
You make a condition

9
00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.933
I will satisfy you with whatever you want.

10
00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:25.133
I Want You

11
00:00:25.716 --> 00:00:27.100
Help me find someone

12
00:00:27.716 --> 00:00:29.200
Help me break up for a long time

13
00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.516
Oops, don't talk about being alone

14
00:00:31.516 --> 00:00:32.983
Ten people will do

15
00:00:34.916 --> 00:00:36.183
But sister

16
00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.650
Why do you like drinking so much?

17
00:00:38.716 --> 00:00:40.133
If you buy it, you can buy it.

18
00:00:40.233 --> 00:00:41.400
Wordy

19
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:42.900
Do you still want to break the million

20
00:00:43.433 --> 00:00:44.250
think

21
00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:46.183
They don't say

22
00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.016
Have any brides died in the past few months?

23
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.216
Then go to the last crime scene first

24
00:00:54.916 --> 00:00:56.150
Can you tell us?

25
00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:58.900
What happened that night? Was it a ghost?

26
00:01:00.633 --> 00:01:03.700
It was the ghost bride who killed my sister and he came back

27
00:01:03.716 --> 00:01:08.333
The Ghost Bride had a daughter who was going to hurt in the east of the village a year ago

28
00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:10.000
Forced to marry a bully

29
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.300
On the night of the wedding, he hung himself in disgrace

30
00:01:13.916 --> 00:01:17.650
In a few days, the bully will hurt his father and die

31
00:01:18.316 --> 00:01:19.533
Since then

32
00:01:20.316 --> 00:01:23.416
The villagers say the ghost bride has a grudge

33
00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:26.250
Possessed by those brides who come back to take revenge on society

34
00:01:27.516 --> 00:01:29.100
Ghost kills

35
00:01:29.833 --> 00:01:31.216
How is that possible?

36
00:01:31.483 --> 00:01:34.100
It's true that night

37
00:01:34.516 --> 00:01:37.250
I just heard my sister yell don't come here

38
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.650
Then my sister set herself on fire

39
00:01:41.916 --> 00:01:45.200
But how are you sure your sister is a 4?

40
00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.650
It was just me and my sister in the room that night

41
00:01:47.883 --> 00:01:50.100
And when I came to the government to investigate the case

42
00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:52.033
Beside the house.

43
00:01:52.033 --> 00:01:54.383
Found the matchbox in my sister's room

44
00:01:54.833 --> 00:01:56.433
Doctor Sunset from Dashuaifu said

45
00:01:56.433 --> 00:01:58.416
This one has my sister's fingerprints all over it

46
00:01:58.633 --> 00:02:01.733
Is it really haunted by ghosts?
