00:00:03.466 --> 00:00:04.600
Don't check

2
00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:06.016
This case has been forced by me

3
00:00:06.866 --> 00:00:07.766
What!

4
00:00:09.466 --> 00:00:12.850
This person is a member of Qianlang's stockade of counterfeit products

5
00:00:13.066 --> 00:00:15.133
It is said that the creditors are decisive

6
00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:16.900
This man has seen an uprising

7
00:00:16.916 --> 00:00:19.700
Breaking into households in the middle of the night to steal property

8
00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:21.633
Afraid of the other party being exposed

9
00:00:21.633 --> 00:00:23.116
I closed the window

10
00:00:23.116 --> 00:00:26.266
And people here use fireplaces to keep warm

11
00:00:26.266 --> 00:00:27.616
Charcoal burning is toxic

12
00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.300
It caused them all to suffocate

13
00:00:30.666 --> 00:00:33.750
Nonsense, I saw a few of them with my own eyes last night

14
00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.600
Obviously died on the street

15
00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.133
That's your hallucination

16
00:00:37.833 --> 00:00:39.766
This is the last time you saw a doctor.

17
00:00:39.916 --> 00:00:43.133
The psychiatric diagnosis issued by the hospital for you

18
00:00:44.666 --> 00:00:45.500
That's not possible.

19
00:00:46.066 --> 00:00:47.816
I was sober last night.

20
00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:51.700
Song Xiaozi, this matter is over

21
00:00:51.866 --> 00:00:54.050
Don't look into this case again.

22
00:00:54.233 --> 00:00:55.950
I will ask the commander to intercede for you.

23
00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:58.216
Let the handsome let you live

24
00:00:58.466 --> 00:01:01.000
This time the credit is mine

25
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.816
Hahahaha

26
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:05.900
Han Erye

27
00:01:06.716 --> 00:01:10.566
Your hospital appraisal certificate is fake, right?

28
00:01:10.866 --> 00:01:11.700
Song Xun

29
00:01:12.466 --> 00:01:14.566
I advise you not to be too busy.

30
00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:16.316
Don't be so stubborn

31
00:01:16.316 --> 00:01:17.950
It's ready for business.

32
00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:19.966
What's your life?

33
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.216
Is that how you act as a parent?

34
00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:25.633
I am their parent

35
00:01:25.633 --> 00:01:28.566
But should they cause trouble for their parents?

36
00:01:28.666 --> 00:01:32.600
Die you want to taste do you have a clue

37
00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.366
It's your business if you die

38
00:01:36.833 --> 00:01:38.216
I not only want to check

39
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.166
I also need to check an ink stone.

40
00:01:41.666 --> 00:01:44.733
I'm with people like you

41
00:01:48.466 --> 00:01:49.700
Yingbin Street

42
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.250
Yingbin Street

43
00:01:51.633 --> 00:01:53.166
Here they come

44
00:01:53.516 --> 00:01:55.250
Here they come
