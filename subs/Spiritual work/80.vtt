00:00:04.766 --> 00:00:05.866
Another fox worm

2
00:00:06.116 --> 00:00:09.066
The thorn of Shanghu was also killed by a tiger insect

3
00:00:09.116 --> 00:00:11.466
Is it really the poison of winter?

4
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:14.383
He doesn't look like he has that ability, does he?

5
00:00:15.116 --> 00:00:17.000
Sister, think of a way

6
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.416
How can you bend your bones?

7
00:00:18.683 --> 00:00:20.983
I do know a way to bend my bones

8
00:00:21.116 --> 00:00:23.633
But there are a million ways to bend your bones.

9
00:00:23.633 --> 00:00:24.833
It may not work.

10
00:00:24.833 --> 00:00:26.566
Oops, a dead horse is a living horse doctor

11
00:00:26.566 --> 00:00:27.566
Is it important to save people?

12
00:00:27.566 --> 00:00:29.416
Ancient insects feed on corpses

13
00:00:29.883 --> 00:00:31.933
Go find a fresh piece of carcass

14
00:00:31.966 --> 00:00:33.533
Maybe lead it out

15
00:00:33.716 --> 00:00:34.516
Corpse

16
00:00:34.516 --> 00:00:36.433
Where can I find corpses for you in this place?

17
00:00:36.433 --> 00:00:38.416
I didn't say it had to be human flesh

18
00:00:38.633 --> 00:00:40.183
Is pork okay?

19
00:00:40.766 --> 00:00:43.333
Help me find fresh pork

20
00:00:57.283 --> 00:00:59.616
Such an ancient art of Qu Gu

21
00:00:59.766 --> 00:01:03.233
How would he, a furry kid in his early 20s, know?

22
00:01:03.233 --> 00:01:06.616
What secret is this kid hiding?
