00:00:03.633 --> 00:00:04.600
Oops Mom Song

2
00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:07.000
You can count as Song, Song

3
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:08.566
Big Joe

4
00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:11.200
What's going on here?

5
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.383
Yesterday, your sister-in-law came and asked me to come and help you.

6
00:00:14.383 --> 00:00:15.500
And when I arrived?

7
00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:18.066
You've been kidnapped by those greeters

8
00:00:18.066 --> 00:00:19.833
Then I thought I had to save you.

9
00:00:19.833 --> 00:00:23.400
Then I'll knock you out with one stick

10
00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:25.850
Thanks so much.

11
00:00:26.783 --> 00:00:28.200
Ah, no.

12
00:00:29.833 --> 00:00:30.633
Ah!

13
00:00:31.066 --> 00:00:32.850
Two more died here.

14
00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.700
Today I have to send it to me for an explanation.

15
00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.850
I was kind enough to help him yesterday

16
00:00:38.033 --> 00:00:39.883
This kid not only doesn't appreciate it

17
00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:43.183
I almost got myself into it

18
00:00:43.183 --> 00:00:45.133
The princess is so trusting

19
00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:47.166
If I had known, I would have shot him

20
00:00:48.183 --> 00:00:50.683
Sir, please let me see the corpse

21
00:00:52.983 --> 00:00:54.583
Let's look at their foreheads.

22
00:00:54.583 --> 00:00:56.083
Maybe find something

23
00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:57.483
forehead

24
00:00:58.633 --> 00:00:59.966
The door is normal

25
00:01:00.433 --> 00:01:02.000
Do you still use the banquet method?

26
00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.366
The Banquet Method can only detect handprints on corpses

27
00:01:05.433 --> 00:01:07.450
But this time it's probably not the hand

28
00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.133
Freezing might work wonders.

29
00:01:12.233 --> 00:01:13.250
Go get me off the ice

30
00:01:20.666 --> 00:01:23.400
Song Xuan, what tricks are you playing?

31
00:01:24.033 --> 00:01:26.233
Previously, he was a Red Banquet Master

32
00:01:26.233 --> 00:01:28.133
Now an ice cube freezer

33
00:01:28.183 --> 00:01:29.666
We're here to solve a case

34
00:01:29.666 --> 00:01:32.000
I'm not here to see you juggle. Shut up

35
00:01:32.433 --> 00:01:34.166
Do you still want to solve the case?
