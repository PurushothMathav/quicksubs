00:00:00.283 --> 00:00:03.433
Uncle, your daughter was born a musical singer, right?

2
00:00:03.483 --> 00:00:05.316
Yeah, come on.

3
00:00:05.566 --> 00:00:07.933
Call out all the blind dates of daughters who have died in the past two years

4
00:00:07.933 --> 00:00:08.866
Open autopsy

5
00:00:08.933 --> 00:00:12.183
What an unscrupulous animal did?

6
00:00:12.333 --> 00:00:15.150
My daughter, hahaha.

7
00:00:15.166 --> 00:00:16.733
And so it did.

8
00:00:16.733 --> 00:00:18.316
Everything fits

9
00:00:19.083 --> 00:00:20.316
What did you find?

10
00:00:20.416 --> 00:00:21.516
Records of Lu Ban

11
00:00:21.683 --> 00:00:23.766
There is a record of the eight-character pure tone technique

12
00:00:23.766 --> 00:00:25.516
The magic of immortality

13
00:00:25.683 --> 00:00:27.350
My brother left without saying goodbye

14
00:00:27.366 --> 00:00:29.266
Most likely a grand sorcery

15
00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:33.183
Then who do you think this Spell Caster might be?

16
00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:34.783
So far

17
00:00:34.816 --> 00:00:36.766
The cold winter stops us again and again

18
00:00:36.766 --> 00:00:37.750
There must be suspects

19
00:00:38.816 --> 00:00:40.416
But something tells me something.

20
00:00:40.416 --> 00:00:41.583
The more obvious

21
00:00:41.966 --> 00:00:43.383
The less the truth

22
00:00:44.483 --> 00:00:46.633
This may have something to do with my brother's death

23
00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:51.783
Go back and tell my sister-in-law the good news of solving the case first

24
00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:55.066
Sister-in-law, I found something about big brother.
