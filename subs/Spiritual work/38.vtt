00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:01.600
Let's go!

2
00:00:03.266 --> 00:00:05.033
You are not afraid of ghosts

3
00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:06.900
I believe in science, okay?

4
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:08.616
A beautiful woman with long legs

5
00:00:08.616 --> 00:00:09.916
Why kill people?

6
00:00:10.183 --> 00:00:13.083
My colleague recruited you and you think my legs look good, right?

7
00:00:14.583 --> 00:00:17.366
Is it white and long? Touch it.

8
00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:22.733
You take

9
00:00:22.733 --> 00:00:26.600
For me, Song is a person who sees color and is eager to see it.

10
00:00:28.266 --> 00:00:31.900
Well, at your level, you are still diligent in catching thieves

11
00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:34.600
You were still a cook when I killed you

12
00:00:35.933 --> 00:00:36.733
Hey

13
00:00:37.066 --> 00:00:39.083
Uh-huh.

14
00:00:40.416 --> 00:00:42.766
Rogue, you let me touch it

15
00:00:42.866 --> 00:00:44.633
You are a bandit and I am a hooligan

16
00:00:44.866 --> 00:00:45.916
who to lose

17
00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:48.233
How do you have zombie medicine?

18
00:00:48.333 --> 00:00:49.833
This zombie drug

19
00:00:50.266 --> 00:00:53.866
After rushing, you can be at the mercy of others

20
00:00:53.866 --> 00:00:55.466
Hmph, is that so?

21
00:00:55.466 --> 00:00:57.300
Then you can do whatever you want now

22
00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.716
You are welcome bro

23
00:01:00.183 --> 00:01:01.716
Do you think I'm stupid?

24
00:01:01.933 --> 00:01:04.400
I can't move when I touch you now

25
00:01:05.383 --> 00:01:06.183
Say

26
00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:08.766
Why do you want to kill people through soldiers?

27
00:01:08.866 --> 00:01:10.716
It's not stupid. It's rare

28
00:01:11.466 --> 00:01:12.933
They deserve to die

29
00:01:12.933 --> 00:01:14.400
I'm here for revenge.

30
00:01:16.933 --> 00:01:18.516
OK

31
00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.433
Hey, what's wrong with you?

32
00:01:25.183 --> 00:01:27.716
I can't solve this zombie drug either.

33
00:01:28.616 --> 00:01:31.266
He misunderstood that the wolf killed the wolf

34
00:01:31.266 --> 00:01:32.800
This woman is also a bandit

35
00:01:33.133 --> 00:01:35.933
Hey, let me ask you, this zombie drug is banned

36
00:01:35.933 --> 00:01:37.366
How did you get that name?

37
00:01:38.383 --> 00:01:39.183
Xiaofang

38
00:01:39.816 --> 00:01:42.033
The driver told me.

39
00:01:42.216 --> 00:01:46.233
He knows how my brother died
