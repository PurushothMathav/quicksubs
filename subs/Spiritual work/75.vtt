00:00:03.266 --> 00:00:04.933
There are so many underworld soldiers out there

2
00:00:04.983 --> 00:00:05.966
You bastard

3
00:00:06.183 --> 00:00:07.866
We almost got killed by you

4
00:00:07.866 --> 00:00:09.333
You didn't die

5
00:00:09.466 --> 00:00:11.600
Tell me what's going on.

6
00:00:11.666 --> 00:00:13.183
What are you?

7
00:00:13.183 --> 00:00:14.800
How dare you judge me?

8
00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:19.566
I am Song Xun.

9
00:00:19.666 --> 00:00:20.466
Song Xun

10
00:00:21.066 --> 00:00:22.766
Detective 5 Song Xun

11
00:00:23.183 --> 00:00:26.250
Lord Song, please save my family

12
00:00:27.033 --> 00:00:29.766
Xiao Oda Er is my ex-girlfriend

13
00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:33.683
You should be his missing brother for many years, right?

14
00:00:34.233 --> 00:00:36.633
It's all my fault for being obsessed with money

15
00:00:36.633 --> 00:00:37.783
Exploited by the cold winter

16
00:00:37.783 --> 00:00:39.666
Killed my unborn sister

17
00:00:39.666 --> 00:00:41.383
For that illusory life

18
00:00:41.383 --> 00:00:44.166
How many families have been destroyed?

19
00:00:45.866 --> 00:00:48.383
I heard the hair sheriff tell me who was up there

20
00:00:48.383 --> 00:00:49.500
What ceremony is going to be held?

21
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:50.833
He must investigate

22
00:00:50.833 --> 00:00:53.766
It didn't take long for him to die, so it was my brother

23
00:00:55.266 --> 00:00:56.566
You know my brother?

24
00:00:57.383 --> 00:01:00.550
Someone tried to kill me after your brother died

25
00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:03.483
After hiding for so many years, they still won't let me go

26
00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:05.750
They will definitely find my family

27
00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:07.933
We're getting closer to the truth.

28
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.333
Brother, I will avenge you soon.

29
00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.083
Since I have 5 seats

30
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.083
I won't sit back and do nothing

31
00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.933
Tell me what's the secret of this wind and rain temple

32
00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:20.283
I don't know.

33
00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:22.383
But I saw it the other day

34
00:01:22.383 --> 00:01:24.783
A monk came down with a child he had just captured

35
00:01:24.783 --> 00:01:26.866
I guess it might be where they hold people

36
00:01:26.866 --> 00:01:28.333
I saw it just now.

37
00:01:28.433 --> 00:01:31.533
The child's body was sealed on the Buddha statue

38
00:01:31.866 --> 00:01:32.666
OK

39
00:01:33.666 --> 00:01:34.766
What are you?

40
00:01:35.183 --> 00:01:37.466
I see it's black down here.

41
00:01:37.466 --> 00:01:39.800
Just pick up a stick for self-defense

42
00:01:39.833 --> 00:01:41.166
This is not a stick.

43
00:01:41.466 --> 00:01:42.650
This is human bone
