1
00:00:26.116 --> 00:00:27.883
Did it hurt when I bit you?

2
00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:33.366
You can keep the counterfeit products in the future

3
00:00:34.116 --> 00:00:37.133
Let's make a pair of happy fairies

4
00:00:39.916 --> 00:00:40.716
OK

5
00:00:41.266 --> 00:00:43.150
But you have to promise to help me find my sister-in-law

6
00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:44.333
Take good care of her

7
00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:47.016
Otherwise I would rather die than obey

8
00:00:49.233 --> 00:00:50.383
Your character

9
00:00:50.383 --> 00:00:53.366
More like a cop I knew before

10
00:00:54.916 --> 00:00:56.050
police

11
00:00:58.983 --> 00:01:01.033
Ah, three years ago.

12
00:01:01.033 --> 00:01:03.616
This little cop was just about to apply for sheriff

13
00:01:03.633 --> 00:01:06.183
Received a serial murder case

14
00:01:06.183 --> 00:01:08.050
This case is extremely strange

15
00:01:08.633 --> 00:01:10.566
It looks like the case is about to be solved

16
00:01:10.833 --> 00:01:12.183
The trail snapped.

17
00:01:12.183 --> 00:01:14.366
As if by something special

18
00:01:14.466 --> 00:01:16.533
The same as strength

19
00:01:17.583 --> 00:01:18.383
Humph

20
00:01:20.316 --> 00:01:21.816
That's pretty bad.

21
00:01:22.833 --> 00:01:26.916
Then his boss told him to give up

22
00:01:26.916 --> 00:01:29.450
But he insisted on finishing the case.

23
00:01:29.583 --> 00:01:33.150
And he ended up putting himself in danger.

24
00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.016
Poisoned to death?

25
00:01:41.266 --> 00:01:42.816
How do you know so well?

26
00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:45.050
Because I sterilized it.

27
00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.716
If my boss hadn't assigned me this task

28
00:01:49.716 --> 00:01:51.866
I actually really want to get to know each other

29
00:01:51.866 --> 00:01:53.016
Check this cop

30
00:01:59.233 --> 00:02:00.450
That police officer?

31
00:02:01.466 --> 00:02:02.650
What's your name?

32
00:02:03.866 --> 00:02:06.450
It seems to be called Song Feng
