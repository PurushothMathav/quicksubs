00:00:00.583 --> 00:00:02.316
That night my child slept

2
00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:03.466
I turn my head

3
00:00:03.466 --> 00:00:05.250
Smoke rose from the bed

4
00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:06.750
The child also disappeared

5
00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:08.916
I slept with the baby in my arms

6
00:00:09.183 --> 00:00:12.716
At dawn, the child becomes a puppet.

7
00:00:13.266 --> 00:00:15.483
So weird

8
00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:18.566
Is it really the Dragon King?

9
00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:22.116
How could humans do such a thing?

10
00:00:22.466 --> 00:00:24.216
It was a woman.

11
00:00:24.216 --> 00:00:26.000
Now it's a kid again

12
00:00:26.616 --> 00:00:30.166
There's no connection between these two cases, is there?

13
00:00:31.666 --> 00:00:34.116
How could such a thing happen, Lord Song?

14
00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:37.050
Why not head to the Wind and Rain Temple for clues?

15
00:00:37.266 --> 00:00:40.583
The people in Stormy Temple City must be in danger

16
00:00:40.583 --> 00:00:42.066
Competing to worship in temples

17
00:00:42.066 --> 00:00:44.800
If you go, you may gain something

18
00:00:45.383 --> 00:00:48.250
But this Wind and Rain Temple has a very high level of folk belief

19
00:00:48.416 --> 00:00:49.783
Won't it cause outrage?

20
00:00:49.783 --> 00:00:51.566
Ah, I'm ready.

21
00:00:51.783 --> 00:00:55.150
This is the fake identity arranged by the commander for the two of you.

22
00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:56.216
Can be deceiving

23
00:00:56.216 --> 00:00:57.600
Lord Wu has a heart

24
00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:59.216
Then someone asked

25
00:00:59.216 --> 00:01:01.583
From now on, you will follow the false identities written on the document

26
00:01:01.583 --> 00:01:02.666
Just answer

27
00:01:02.666 --> 00:01:05.516
It won't be revealed. Marriage contract
