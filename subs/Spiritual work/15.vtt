00:00:00.116 --> 00:00:01.216
If I'm not mistaken

2
00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:03.083
Bodies are still buried around the village

3
00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:05.683
Go look for it

4
00:00:08.866 --> 00:00:11.350
Xun, you are amazing

5
00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:13.683
How do you know the deceased didn't commit suicide?

6
00:00:13.783 --> 00:00:15.050
The killer is smart

7
00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.366
But he missed a crucial point.

8
00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:20.650
That is the deceased if it is himself

9
00:00:20.866 --> 00:00:22.966
How is it possible to throw a matchbox?

10
00:00:23.316 --> 00:00:25.216
Who is in the coffin?

11
00:00:25.266 --> 00:00:28.416
The only explanation is that the murderer was someone else

12
00:00:28.716 --> 00:00:30.966
What must be a murderer?

13
00:00:31.783 --> 00:00:34.283
The bride wants help from the outside world but can't do business

14
00:00:35.233 --> 00:00:37.550
Grabbing a matchbox and throwing it out the window

15
00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:38.650
Was discovered by the murderer

16
00:00:38.983 --> 00:00:41.366
In the chaos, the deceased killed a murderer

17
00:00:41.866 --> 00:00:43.566
While the other murderer tried to protect himself

18
00:00:43.916 --> 00:00:44.816
Rescue it

19
00:00:44.833 --> 00:00:46.250
Burn the house down

20
00:00:46.433 --> 00:00:48.650
Disguise accomplices as dead brides

21
00:00:48.666 --> 00:00:51.450
But think about my sister's murderer if it weren't for ghosts

22
00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:53.166
Who will it be?

23
00:00:54.066 --> 00:00:55.250
Whoever he is

24
00:00:55.666 --> 00:00:57.250
He will definitely find him

25
00:00:57.916 --> 00:00:59.366
Ah Nobita

26
00:00:59.583 --> 00:01:02.316
Your good brother Su Daqiang came to see you just now.

27
00:01:02.316 --> 00:01:05.883
He said that Bitter Winter wants to invite you to dinner?

28
00:01:09.666 --> 00:01:12.450
Boy, don't blame me for being cruel

29
00:01:12.633 --> 00:01:15.083
I really can't keep you
