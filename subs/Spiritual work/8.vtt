00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:03.333
Our family Ah Xun saved Dashuai's daughter

2
00:00:03.333 --> 00:00:05.233
Of course the commander can't do it

3
00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:10.583
Why didn't Hyun-in-law say it earlier?

4
00:00:10.583 --> 00:00:12.383
You saved the handsome daughter

5
00:00:12.383 --> 00:00:14.083
You've got a great future.

6
00:00:14.183 --> 00:00:15.800
I will marry my daughter to you

7
00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:17.800
Don't be so comforting

8
00:00:18.816 --> 00:00:19.616
uncle

9
00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:23.650
But you want me to 200,000 betrothal gift, I can't afford it

10
00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:25.550
What uncle and what bride price?

11
00:00:25.616 --> 00:00:27.633
I'll charge you 1,000 yuan

12
00:00:28.016 --> 00:00:29.400
No, no.

13
00:00:29.816 --> 00:00:32.916
From now on, you are my own son

14
00:00:32.983 --> 00:00:34.733
I'll sign the marriage contract now

15
00:00:34.733 --> 00:00:38.883
Brother Xun, don't be angry if your father agrees.

16
00:00:39.333 --> 00:00:40.616
That's great.

17
00:00:40.616 --> 00:00:42.116
Then it's settled.

18
00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:44.250
OK

19
00:00:45.016 --> 00:00:46.483
Yinuo Qianjin

20
00:00:46.733 --> 00:00:49.800
Uncle, you shouldn't regret it, right?

21
00:00:50.016 --> 00:00:51.400
What is your name uncle

22
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.433
Ask Dad to do the wedding in two days

23
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.800
Yan'er, um, you will stay at the Song family tonight

24
00:00:58.216 --> 00:01:00.550
Dad, this is too urgent

25
00:01:00.583 --> 00:01:02.633
What's the hurry? That's it.

26
00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.733
Mr. Song, can we go now?

27
00:01:05.733 --> 00:01:07.516
Dashuai is waiting for you

28
00:01:07.533 --> 00:01:10.700
Are you afraid of leaking and stealing?

29
00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.233
After you were injured, you never dared to touch a corpse again

30
00:01:14.783 --> 00:01:16.283
If you can't solve the case

31
00:01:16.333 --> 00:01:18.383
What should I do if the handsome gets drunk?

32
00:01:18.383 --> 00:01:19.433
Sister-in-law don't worry

33
00:01:19.616 --> 00:01:21.550
I'm not what I used to be

34
00:01:22.583 --> 00:01:23.433
Trust me.

35
00:01:23.533 --> 00:01:26.350
I'm glad to see you cheering up sister-in-law

36
00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.750
But if you have three long and two short

37
00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:31.533
What should I do?

38
00:01:31.533 --> 00:01:33.950
How can I explain to your dead brother?

39
00:01:35.733 --> 00:01:38.000
That's why I'm going.

40
00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:39.450
Because of this case

41
00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.633
It is very likely that it has something to do with the death of the eldest brother
