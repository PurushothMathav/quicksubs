00:00:00.766 --> 00:00:01.566
sister-in-law

2
00:00:15.033 --> 00:00:16.066
slutty

3
00:00:17.366 --> 00:00:19.866
Sao Sao, where have you been? Sao Sao

4
00:00:21.433 --> 00:00:23.116
Every time a woman leaves you

5
00:00:23.116 --> 00:00:24.466
Do you do this

6
00:00:24.683 --> 00:00:25.983
How is that possible?

7
00:00:26.966 --> 00:00:30.533
My sister-in-law is no ordinary woman

8
00:00:32.966 --> 00:00:33.783
Want some?

9
00:00:34.433 --> 00:00:36.266
Drink to relieve worries

10
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.216
Anything else?

11
00:00:47.633 --> 00:00:49.216
You like drinking so much

12
00:00:49.883 --> 00:00:54.466
Is it because you also have someone you like to care about?

13
00:00:55.483 --> 00:00:57.416
He likes the way I drink

14
00:00:59.683 --> 00:01:01.783
Forget it.

15
00:01:02.366 --> 00:01:04.900
Don't be too sad, let's go.

16
00:01:07.483 --> 00:01:09.400
Why are you still here?

17
00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.933
The handsome calls you to eat together, where are you throwing your legs?

18
00:01:13.366 --> 00:01:14.383
I wanna go.

19
00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:16.900
What's wrong with you?

20
00:01:17.083 --> 00:01:19.700
You weren't this bored before, were you?

21
00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:22.533
What's that?

22
00:01:23.633 --> 00:01:25.383
I don't want to work for the boss anymore

23
00:01:25.766 --> 00:01:28.333
I want to find my sister-in-law, are you stupid?

24
00:01:28.566 --> 00:01:30.366
Working for the big boss has a bright future

25
00:01:30.366 --> 00:01:32.816
Are you worth it for such a woman?

26
00:01:35.033 --> 00:01:35.833
know

27
00:01:37.433 --> 00:01:38.733
I figured it out.

28
00:01:38.916 --> 00:01:40.416
I'm leaving tonight

29
00:01:40.883 --> 00:01:43.033
My sister-in-law gave me this life

30
00:01:43.033 --> 00:01:44.600
If I can't even protect him

31
00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.616
What use do I want this glory and wealth?

32
00:01:47.166 --> 00:01:49.066
Why don't you think about it again?

33
00:01:49.683 --> 00:01:51.733
Daqiang, listen to me

34
00:01:51.966 --> 00:01:54.766
Don't tell him about the commander

35
00:01:54.766 --> 00:01:56.316
He won't let me go

36
00:01:56.316 --> 00:01:59.333
And lying to the commander is a deadly crime

37
00:01:59.366 --> 00:02:00.766
Brothers for so many years

38
00:02:00.766 --> 00:02:02.866
Even if you kill me, I have to help you

39
00:02:03.833 --> 00:02:04.933
Thanks bro

40
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.800
president

41
00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:16.783
Excuse me.

42
00:02:17.716 --> 00:02:20.100
I have so much gambling debt I can't help it
