00:00:02.183 --> 00:00:05.316
Hey, isn't this the owner of Qianlang's counterfeit products?

2
00:00:06.133 --> 00:00:08.116
Hey, Second Master Han, Song Xuan

3
00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:11.016
Are you defending a bandit who kills innocent people?

4
00:00:11.016 --> 00:00:13.500
He said he was here for revenge.

5
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.233
Maybe there's something else going on.

6
00:00:16.216 --> 00:00:18.133
When he saw the woman falling into the grass, he became a bandit

7
00:00:18.133 --> 00:00:19.633
There must be some engine

8
00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:22.016
Go away you kill him now

9
00:00:22.016 --> 00:00:23.933
What about the police officers who get shot?

10
00:00:23.933 --> 00:00:25.350
The responsibility lies entirely with you

11
00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:27.016
You hand him over to me

12
00:00:27.016 --> 00:00:28.883
I'll help him dissolve the poison of Youshu

13
00:00:29.983 --> 00:00:31.500
What if you can't solve it?

14
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:32.716
If I can't solve it

15
00:00:33.016 --> 00:00:34.500
You killed us both

16
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.283
OK, deal.

17
00:00:36.933 --> 00:00:40.000
Well, does time work out?

18
00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:42.883
No.

19
00:00:43.416 --> 00:00:44.900
Didn't you say there was a way before?

20
00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:46.483
Why is there no way now?

21
00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:49.283
I drank too much to remember

22
00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.050
Can you wake up a little?

23
00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:52.916
You almost got me killed.

24
00:00:53.333 --> 00:00:54.550
Oh, right.

25
00:00:55.583 --> 00:00:59.750
Just massage the practitioner's atrium point.

26
00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:00.916
Oh Atrium Point

27
00:01:00.983 --> 00:01:02.483
Okay, atrium point

28
00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:06.883
Where is the atrium point?

29
00:01:09.983 --> 00:01:11.916
Here girl

30
00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.233
What I'm going to do next

31
00:01:14.583 --> 00:01:15.883
Maybe a little presumptuous

32
00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.033
I hope you don't think I'm a pervert

33
00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:20.183
Unmarked long wing

34
00:01:20.183 --> 00:01:22.150
I can cover my eyes.

35
00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.183
You really can't see?

36
00:01:29.183 --> 00:01:31.350
Hey, where are you touching?

37
00:01:31.733 --> 00:01:32.533
Ah!

38
00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:34.950
Sorry, spare a little

39
00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.200
Better?

40
00:01:38.333 --> 00:01:41.650
Oh, you might as well take it off and touch it directly.

41
00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:43.583
You can still see on time

42
00:01:43.583 --> 00:01:47.033
It's easy to touch, why don't you compare my body with his?

43
00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:49.400
Who is better?

44
00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:53.716
Please, sister.

45
00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.433
Don't challenge my bottom line, okay?

46
00:01:56.616 --> 00:01:58.800
The girl hopes you will cooperate.

47
00:01:59.216 --> 00:02:00.350
Cooperate with me to detoxify you.

48
00:02:03.983 --> 00:02:06.716
Ah oops forgot

49
00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.550
This can also detoxify zombie poison.

50
00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.883
Well, that solves it.

51
00:02:14.733 --> 00:02:16.800
Please wake up next time, okay?

52
00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.283
Killed by you?

53
00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:21.083
Uh uh
