4
00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:11.466
Li Shengqiang, how dare you?

5
00:00:11.466 --> 00:00:12.666
Even the skeleton dares to break through

6
00:00:13.266 --> 00:00:14.533
Ah crazy

7
00:00:14.533 --> 00:00:16.700
Your boss sold off his property and ran away

8
00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:18.366
Why are you still a tanman?

9
00:00:18.366 --> 00:00:20.533
Are you not so filial to your parents?

10
00:00:20.533 --> 00:00:21.966
You don't wait here

11
00:00:21.966 --> 00:00:23.466
You have to dare to smile today

12
00:00:23.466 --> 00:00:24.633
I can't spare you.

13
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.533
Then you try it.

14
00:00:26.533 --> 00:00:28.833
You see if I do it or not, you're done

15
00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:32.066
Xiaoling'er, I'm afraid you don't know yet

16
00:00:32.066 --> 00:00:34.700
Everything this little guy said was a lie to you

17
00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.500
Do you know who his fiancee is?

18
00:00:36.666 --> 00:00:39.166
Southern Province Jingwei Chief Shuai Long Xiaoyun

19
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.133
He's a fucking undercover sent by Jingwei

20
00:00:41.133 --> 00:00:41.900
Come to you

21
00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.133
I just want to marry you all off and go to jail

22
00:00:44.133 --> 00:00:45.666
Whether Brother Fang is an undercover agent or not

23
00:00:45.666 --> 00:00:47.066
He won't hurt me

24
00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:50.866
Oops, I didn't expect the ancient city brothers.

25
00:00:50.866 --> 00:00:53.000
The old calf can still give birth to a daughter like you

26
00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.100
Someone sold it and counted the money for people?

27
00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.300
It seems that uncle has really hurt you.

28
00:00:59.333 --> 00:01:01.066
Come come come come

29
00:01:02.666 --> 00:01:03.700
Stop talking nonsense

30
00:01:03.866 --> 00:01:05.400
Is there any way to come at me?

31
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.100
Since neither of you fucking want to run away?

32
00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.633
Don't stop

33
00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.800

Oh, dear.

36
00:01:20.966 --> 00:01:22.000
Oh, dear.

37
00:01:28.166 --> 00:01:32.500

47
00:01:53.466 --> 00:01:54.800
You are not a pig

48
00:01:54.933 --> 00:01:57.500

This stall?

51
00:02:00.733 --> 00:02:03.966
Why do you have to sell today?

52
00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.466
Lin Shao said

53
00:02:05.466 --> 00:02:09.033
The price difference in the middle is with Gu Linger's life
