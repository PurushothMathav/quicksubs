00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:01.566
Linger hurt a nerve

2
00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.266
I'm afraid I'll never wake up in my life

3
00:00:04.266 --> 00:00:05.833
There is no other cure

4
00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:07.433
I'm going to the doctor

5
00:00:07.666 --> 00:00:10.600
Everything is Linger. What's wrong?

6
00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:12.800
The madman told Lao Tzu what happened to Ling'er

7
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.500
Otherwise, I won't tell you anything

8
00:00:15.566 --> 00:00:16.466
Brother Gu

9
00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:19.366
From the moment you kill the first person and do the first thing

10
00:00:19.366 --> 00:00:20.633
You should know

11
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:22.300
The law goes back and doesn't forget

12
00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:23.800
You still have it here called filial piety

13
00:00:23.966 --> 00:00:25.200
Have you ever considered

14
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:26.200
If you die

15
00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:27.333
Linger, who will save Gu?

16
00:00:27.333 --> 00:00:29.233
Ah, who saved Linger?

17
00:00:34.566 --> 00:00:37.166
Brother Feng, is something wrong with you?

18
00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:40.500
Ah!

19
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.566
You don't have to explain

20
00:00:42.566 --> 00:00:43.500
Wu Chenxiong

21
00:00:43.566 --> 00:00:46.266
Those documents found in your safe

22
00:00:46.466 --> 00:00:48.200
Enough for you to be shot immediately

23
00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.766
You have no chance, what happened to your daughter?

24
00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.266
You calm down

25
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.766
It's been hard work.

26
00:00:56.166 --> 00:00:57.433
Go home and see mom

27
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:02.666
Sit down and eat

28
00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:07.266
Son, you haven't been back these days.

29
00:01:07.266 --> 00:01:09.100
Mom has been holding on to it

30
00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.633
I'm afraid something will happen to you.

31
00:01:10.666 --> 00:01:11.966
Where have you been?

32
00:01:11.966 --> 00:01:14.166
Ah mom

33
00:01:14.666 --> 00:01:18.200
Tibetan Feng has been on a business trip out of town for a while

34
00:01:18.666 --> 00:01:19.666
Don't worry.

35
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.866
In the future, we will often go home from get off work to see you.

36
00:01:23.933 --> 00:01:25.233
By the way, Xiaoyun

37
00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.966
Our Tibetan style is also old and not small

38
00:01:28.133 --> 00:01:30.200
Look at your marriage

39
00:01:32.366 --> 00:01:34.200
Let me take this.

40
00:01:36.333 --> 00:01:37.600
Lao Tzu is not good

41
00:01:38.266 --> 00:01:39.300
What's going on?
