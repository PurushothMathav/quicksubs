00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:02.766
Do you want evidence? I have it.

2
00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:04.266
What nonsense are you talking about?

3
00:00:04.266 --> 00:00:05.400
Crazy crazy

4
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.200
You weren't beaten silly by Lin Zhiqiang, were you?

5
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.900
Chu Cangfeng is now a case handling incident

6
00:00:09.966 --> 00:00:12.300
Every word you say will become evidence

7
00:00:12.333 --> 00:00:13.666
I'll ask you again.

8
00:00:13.766 --> 00:00:14.866
What did you just say?

9
00:00:14.866 --> 00:00:16.766
I have proof that Brother Dong Cheng committed a crime

10
00:00:16.766 --> 00:00:18.866
Including he was just a fire plotter

11
00:00:18.866 --> 00:00:20.166
Kidnapping witnesses

12
00:00:20.166 --> 00:00:21.866
And the industrial chain of his slaughtering side

13
00:00:21.966 --> 00:00:24.200
Stall personnel who mix and digest inventory

14
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:25.666
I have both upper and lower limits

15
00:00:25.666 --> 00:00:27.766
Crazy you wanna be scared bro

16
00:00:27.766 --> 00:00:30.700
What is the wrong move of the crazy father?

17
00:00:31.333 --> 00:00:33.166
You want to betray me

18
00:00:34.666 --> 00:00:36.400
Linger, give it to me.

19
00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:37.600
LINERDU

20
00:00:38.566 --> 00:00:39.666
Can't give him anything

21
00:00:39.666 --> 00:00:41.066
Otherwise it's all over

22
00:00:41.066 --> 00:00:41.866
Dad?

23
00:00:42.133 --> 00:00:44.566
I'm sorry I opened your safe

24
00:00:44.566 --> 00:00:46.766
I know what you've done all these years

25
00:00:46.766 --> 00:00:47.566
Linger

26
00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.066
Dad has difficulties

27
00:00:50.333 --> 00:00:52.666
I know you're doing this for my own good

28
00:00:52.666 --> 00:00:54.500
But you can't make mistakes again and again.

29
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.133
I'm doing this for you too

30
00:00:56.133 --> 00:00:57.066
Brother Feng said

31
00:00:57.066 --> 00:00:58.266
As long as you are willing to confess

32
00:00:58.466 --> 00:01:00.000
We still have a chance

33
00:01:07.066 --> 00:01:08.800
This is the key to the safe in the ancient villa

34
00:01:09.066 --> 00:01:10.300
The evidence is all there

35
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:13.966
Why should I thank you?

36
00:01:13.966 --> 00:01:15.300
You can call me Master

37
00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:16.866
You can also call me strong

38
00:01:19.166 --> 00:01:21.033
It turns out that you are in awe

39
00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.300
You damn undercover

40
00:01:23.866 --> 00:01:25.666
Gang rules are to be enforced today

41
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.300
To avenge the blood hatred of the dead brothers in the villa
