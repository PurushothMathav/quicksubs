00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:01.366
Rosser is bad

2
00:00:01.366 --> 00:00:03.300
Lin Shengqiang ran away, what happened?

3
00:00:03.333 --> 00:00:04.300
Of course he's super deer

4
00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:05.400
And there is someone to answer

5
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:06.800
And drove through our self-control

6
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.200
Rosena, shall we chase?

7
00:00:08.266 --> 00:00:10.366
We've alerted the snake now

8
00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.066
Besides, catch Lin Shengqiang

9
00:00:12.066 --> 00:00:14.100
We have no evidence to chase them directly.

10
00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:17.500
Now is the time to seize the breakthrough of Gucheng Xiong

11
00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:18.733
All awe obeys orders

12
00:00:18.733 --> 00:00:20.200
Transfer to Xiong's house in the ancient city

13
00:00:20.333 --> 00:00:23.633
Yes sir, this is the key to Xiong's safe in the ancient city

14
00:00:23.766 --> 00:00:25.400
After confirming that it can be opened

15
00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.800
Bring the whole safe back to the middle

16
00:00:27.966 --> 00:00:28.800
understand

17
00:00:29.366 --> 00:00:32.066
Remember, no one is allowed to touch the safe

18
00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.200
Write it down when you figure it out

19
00:00:35.266 --> 00:00:36.266
You take the initiative to explain

20
00:00:36.266 --> 00:00:37.833
It's two properties from what we found out.

21
00:00:38.066 --> 00:00:40.000
Ladies and gentlemen, I don't blame you

22
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.366
But brothers

23
00:00:41.366 --> 00:00:43.533
Tell me about Linger's current situation.

24
00:00:43.533 --> 00:00:45.100
Write down your crime first

25
00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:47.333
I asked you how is Linger now?

26
00:00:47.333 --> 00:00:50.766
How many people did Gu Changxiong kill and do?

27
00:00:50.766 --> 00:00:52.466
You deserve Tilinger too.

28
00:00:52.466 --> 00:00:54.733
If you hadn't been able to show up like this

29
00:00:54.733 --> 00:00:56.000
I can't help it.

30
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.800
I am such a precious daughter

31
00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.100
I don't fight him with bare hands

32
00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:01.900
How did he grow up carefree?

33
00:01:03.166 --> 00:01:04.966
You have to ask yourself

34
00:01:04.966 --> 00:01:07.166
Is that why you kill more people?

35
00:01:07.166 --> 00:01:08.466
I had no choice

36
00:01:12.666 --> 00:01:13.500
wind

37
00:01:17.166 --> 00:01:18.500
If you hurt a nerve

38
00:01:18.666 --> 00:01:21.500
I'm afraid I'll never wake up in my life
