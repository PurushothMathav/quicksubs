00:00:10.733 --> 00:00:13.833
Does the madman know why I brought you here?

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:16.500
Let's go!

5
00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:20.200

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.366
I'm out these days and I'm always uneasy

8
00:00:26.533 --> 00:00:30.800
I feel that there is always a smell of awe in the villa

9
00:00:31.066 --> 00:00:32.900
Boss, what do you mean?

10
00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:34.966

Big brother's recent check

19
00:00:57.666 --> 00:00:59.500
Is it too risky to do this?

20
00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.266
