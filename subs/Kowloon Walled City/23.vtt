00:00:02.166 --> 00:00:04.466
Ping'er, I am willing to exchange one life for another

2
00:00:04.466 --> 00:00:05.466
What are you doing?

3
00:00:05.466 --> 00:00:07.300
Dad, I'm not fooling around.

4
00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:09.466
I heard everything you just said

5
00:00:09.466 --> 00:00:10.866
I called the news

6
00:00:10.866 --> 00:00:12.200
I lost the file

7
00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.166
It has nothing to do with Brother Cao Feng

8
00:00:14.166 --> 00:00:16.800
If you must punish me, then punish me

9
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.500
Okay, dad, I don't blame you

10
00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:20.700
Put that gun down for me

11
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.466
No, even if you promise me now

12
00:00:23.466 --> 00:00:25.366
You will still say that I will no longer embarrass him.

13
00:00:25.366 --> 00:00:27.000
What do you want?

14
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.366
I want Zanfingo to be my bodyguard

15
00:00:30.366 --> 00:00:32.100
24 hours a day

16
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:33.100
As long as I'm here

17
00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:34.966
Don't even think about embarrassing him

18
00:00:34.966 --> 00:00:35.966
Brother, this

19
00:00:36.066 --> 00:00:38.666
I'm just such a baby girl

20
00:00:38.766 --> 00:00:41.833
Listen to you, put the gun down for me now

21
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.833
Crazy, you heard me

22
00:00:47.866 --> 00:00:50.733
From now on, don't interfere in anything at the villa

23
00:00:50.733 --> 00:00:52.066
You only have one thing

24
00:00:52.066 --> 00:00:53.633
Just protect Linger

25
00:00:53.866 --> 00:00:55.800
If Linger has any questions

26
00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:59.466
Settle it with your new feud and old accounts

27
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:02.400
Brother Rufeng, you are now Linger's bodyguard

28
00:01:02.533 --> 00:01:04.133
Come with me back to the house to sleep

29
00:01:04.133 --> 00:01:06.533
You're not suitable

30
00:01:06.533 --> 00:01:08.366
Don't you need protection when you sleep?

31
00:01:11.366 --> 00:01:13.600
Brother Xiong

32
00:01:16.066 --> 00:01:17.366
What's next?

33
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.400
I stare at the madman

34
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.200
If there is any agenda, just leave

35
00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:23.200
And

36
00:01:23.333 --> 00:01:26.166
Wait for all the contacts to find out his bottom line immediately

37
00:01:26.166 --> 00:01:28.033
Be quick yes

38
00:01:29.733 --> 00:01:31.033
In awe of you.

39
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.066
Fortunately, I saved a hand

40
00:01:33.133 --> 00:01:34.933
I became a lot of fake data.

41
00:01:34.933 --> 00:01:36.466
They can't find me for now.

42
00:01:36.466 --> 00:01:39.266
But they'll also slow us down

43
00:01:39.566 --> 00:01:40.866
It didn't work.

44
00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:44.500
Then we're going to hide it from the world
