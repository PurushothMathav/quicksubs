00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:01.466
You go back to the house and rest first

2
00:00:01.466 --> 00:00:03.033
I talk to the madman alone

3
00:00:03.333 --> 00:00:05.733
Dad, I haven't finished talking about Brother Hidden Dragon yet

4
00:00:05.733 --> 00:00:07.133
Then you can go back to the house to rest.

5
00:00:07.133 --> 00:00:08.866
Hmm dad

6
00:00:08.866 --> 00:00:12.200
Be obedient, miss, please

7
00:00:16.366 --> 00:00:19.766
Crazy, where did I send what I asked you to send?

8
00:00:19.766 --> 00:00:22.666
I have personally handed over the recruitment to Brother Haha.

9
00:00:24.566 --> 00:00:26.166
It was handed over to the guard

10
00:00:26.166 --> 00:00:28.166
And now you're lying to me?

11
00:00:28.366 --> 00:00:30.600
You are now in the hands of the guards

12
00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:32.933
Xiaoming is looking for someone to decipher it quickly.

13
00:00:32.933 --> 00:00:34.066
Just mention

14
00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.066
They can get the results and send them to me

15
00:00:37.533 --> 00:00:39.100
Brother, shouldn't you?

16
00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.100
We handed it over to him at will.

17
00:00:44.966 --> 00:00:47.633
I really can't see through the house thing

18
00:00:47.766 --> 00:00:50.700
What is Crouching Tiger Villa going to do?

19
00:00:50.733 --> 00:00:53.100
Big brother was in a very critical situation at the time

20
00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.666
I just want to ask for Linger

21
00:00:54.666 --> 00:00:56.833
I didn't think too much about it.

22
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.166
Think you can survive the night with that explanation?

23
00:01:03.166 --> 00:01:04.033
Ah!

24
00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:07.900
Dad, what are you doing?

25
00:01:09.366 --> 00:01:10.666
Don't stand up for adults

26
00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.300
Go home and rest

27
00:01:13.133 --> 00:01:16.333
Dad, I never ask about business

28
00:01:16.333 --> 00:01:17.900
But Caofeng was there to save me

29
00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:19.600
Why are you making it difficult for him?

30
00:01:19.933 --> 00:01:23.433
Ling'er, go back to the house first, and I'll explain it to my brother.

31
00:01:23.766 --> 00:01:25.066
I'm not going back

32
00:01:25.133 --> 00:01:27.433
Brother Tibetan Feng made a mistake to save me

33
00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:29.666
Ah Linger

34
00:01:30.333 --> 00:01:32.266
I would trade my life for my life
