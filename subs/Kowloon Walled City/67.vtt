00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.200
Say what?

2
00:00:01.366 --> 00:00:04.000
I have done business with Mr. J more than once

3
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.233
He was generous.

4
00:00:05.266 --> 00:00:06.566
And very powerful

5
00:00:06.566 --> 00:00:09.000
At the beginning of this year, he found someone to metabolize me

6
00:00:09.566 --> 00:00:10.933
Said when I got out of prison

7
00:00:10.933 --> 00:00:14.366
He will come to Southern Province in person to negotiate a big sale with me

8
00:00:14.733 --> 00:00:16.966
But it's because you've been watching it too long

9
00:00:16.966 --> 00:00:18.766
It never happened.

10
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.900
Therefore, Lin Shengqiang is eager to occupy the magpie's nest

11
00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:21.966
To replace you

12
00:00:21.966 --> 00:00:24.600
Become Mr. Ji's only partner in Southern Province

13
00:00:24.766 --> 00:00:27.166
Well, Mr. Ji came to South Province

14
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.000
What is the big sale?

15
00:00:30.166 --> 00:00:31.433
I want to see Linger

16
00:00:31.466 --> 00:00:33.400
Otherwise I won't say anything

17
00:00:33.733 --> 00:00:34.966
You be honest first

18
00:00:35.066 --> 00:00:36.666
Then you just wait.

19
00:00:36.666 --> 00:00:39.566
These are in cooperation with Lin Shengxiang Jingcheng

20
00:00:39.566 --> 00:00:41.833
Don't say it's your location then.

21
00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.966
No one knows. Okay.

22
00:00:43.966 --> 00:00:45.833
I promise to take you to see Linger

23
00:00:46.866 --> 00:00:47.766
But

24
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.966
The doctor said that Wu Lin Er has just shown signs of awakening

25
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.966
Not too much mood swings yet

26
00:00:53.966 --> 00:00:55.366
Please go out first

27
00:00:55.366 --> 00:00:57.366
I want to be alone with Linger

28
00:00:58.066 --> 00:01:00.233
Aren't you afraid of his class escape?

29
00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:02.600
Come on.

30
00:01:06.133 --> 00:01:08.466
Linger, it's all Dad's fault

31
00:01:08.466 --> 00:01:09.266
But

32
00:01:09.266 --> 00:01:11.700
Why do you have to block that damn undercover?

33
00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:12.800
What about bullets?

34
00:01:12.966 --> 00:01:14.733
Dad has been in Nancheng for so many years

35
00:01:14.733 --> 00:01:16.200
Never been afraid of anything

36
00:01:16.566 --> 00:01:18.500
Only you are Dad's weakness

37
00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.300
You hand over the golden key

38
00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:23.533
Dad, go in again, how should you live?

39
00:01:23.533 --> 00:01:25.433
You can't

40
00:01:25.533 --> 00:01:27.166
I can't be trapped by them

41
00:01:27.166 --> 00:01:28.666
Linger, wait a minute

42
00:01:28.666 --> 00:01:30.866
Dad will pick you up soon.
