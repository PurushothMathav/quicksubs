00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:02.400
Zhongyun Tiger Fang Junjie

2
00:00:02.466 --> 00:00:05.800
Jiangbei Ren Chengsan, can you meet this gentleman?

3
00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:07.866
That's the line I pulled back then

4
00:00:07.866 --> 00:00:11.166
Why are you going to climb on the old head now?

5
00:00:11.166 --> 00:00:13.666
Today is the ordinary past

6
00:00:13.666 --> 00:00:17.666
There is no eternal big brother in the offline society of Dog Chengxiong

7
00:00:17.966 --> 00:00:19.400
Only eternal interests

8
00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.266
You know, you want money now, you don't have any money.

9
00:00:22.333 --> 00:00:23.866
If you want a stall, there is no stall.

10
00:00:23.866 --> 00:00:24.700
Come here

11
00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:27.666
Boss, hurry up and get out with your pony

12
00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.366
Who says we don't have stalls?

13
00:00:29.366 --> 00:00:33.133
There are now 34 skilled workers at 13 stalls in the southern province

14
00:00:33.133 --> 00:00:34.800
Nissan BRICS 3,000

15
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.133
It's all from my Crouching Tiger Villa

16
00:00:36.133 --> 00:00:37.966
Hahahaha

17
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.566
Who is so big-mouthed?

18
00:00:41.366 --> 00:00:44.166
Yo, the storage style, this wine hasn't been served yet

19
00:00:44.166 --> 00:00:46.066
Start lying

20
00:00:46.933 --> 00:00:48.600
I beg you to understand the situation

21
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.066
Who doesn't know now?

22
00:00:50.133 --> 00:00:51.966
All the production stalls for boys

23
00:00:51.966 --> 00:00:53.533
All owned by Qiangsheng Group

24
00:00:53.533 --> 00:00:54.166
Mr. Lin

25
00:00:54.166 --> 00:00:57.166
I hope you will take care of the boys' business in the future.

26
00:00:57.166 --> 00:00:58.333
Hum well

27
00:00:58.333 --> 00:01:01.000
If this dog becomes a bear, dare to cause you trouble again

28
00:01:01.366 --> 00:01:03.966
Leave it to our Jiangbei Chamber of Commerce to handle it.

29
00:01:03.966 --> 00:01:06.600
You, Lin Shengqiang, Lin Shengqiang

30
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.466
Don't think you control the stall

31
00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.166
You can own these industries

32
00:01:11.266 --> 00:01:12.400
What do you mean?

33
00:01:12.933 --> 00:01:15.133
As long as I give the order

34
00:01:15.133 --> 00:01:17.600
The stall worker will initiate a self-destruct program

35
00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.066
At that time, you will not only be empty of bamboo baskets

36
00:01:20.333 --> 00:01:23.666
And it will also become the number one target of awe

37
00:01:23.933 --> 00:01:25.100
Ah!

38
00:01:25.766 --> 00:01:27.833
Hahaha fuck

39
00:01:28.866 --> 00:01:30.066
You stinky pony

40
00:01:30.066 --> 00:01:31.566
Is this your place to speak?

41
00:01:31.566 --> 00:01:33.366
Didn't your boss teach you?

42
00:01:34.933 --> 00:01:37.100
Chuzuangfeng is not a horse boy now

43
00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.033
He is the son-in-law of my ancient city line

44
00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:42.100
The future head of Crouching Tiger Villa
