1
00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:01.300
Then die together

2
00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:03.266
Come on, wait, wait.

3
00:00:03.366 --> 00:00:05.566
Big brother tied a detonator

4
00:00:06.933 --> 00:00:08.500
How dare you play with your life?

5
00:00:10.366 --> 00:00:11.700
I hurt you.

6
00:00:11.766 --> 00:00:13.966
Big brother, the man doesn't eat, and he fainted in front of him.

7
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:15.800
Why don't we withdraw?

8
00:00:16.566 --> 00:00:17.800
Retreat your mother

9
00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.766
Look at your evil bear

10
00:00:19.933 --> 00:00:21.733
What the hell do I usually teach you?

11
00:00:21.733 --> 00:00:24.633
Just such a small scene is fucking intimidated

12
00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:25.900
Then what the hell are you playing?

13
00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:26.866
It's not that I dare not

14
00:00:26.866 --> 00:00:29.400
Brother, the main reason is that the risk is a bit too big.

15
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.366
Brothers, this is the advantage

16
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.433
100,000 is enough

17
00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:37.766
I'll put it out there today.

18
00:00:38.066 --> 00:00:39.800
Anyone who can borrow a table to pick their arms

19
00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.600
I'll add 100,000

20
00:00:43.133 --> 00:00:44.366
Whoever catches Gu Ling'er

21
00:00:44.766 --> 00:00:46.700
I'll pay 500,000

22
00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:47.366
Hey you

23
00:00:47.366 --> 00:00:49.733
You fucking think I'm afraid of you if you tie a detonator?

24
00:00:49.733 --> 00:00:50.466
I'll tell you what.

25
00:00:50.466 --> 00:00:51.600
Your little trick

26
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.566
I played it ten years ago

27
00:00:53.566 --> 00:00:54.666
Do you dare to order?

28
00:00:54.666 --> 00:00:57.066
You order one for me to try, and I will satisfy you.

29
00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:00.766
Oh my god this kid is so exciting

30
00:01:00.766 --> 00:01:02.533
How the hell dare you?

31
00:01:02.533 --> 00:01:04.833
Big brother go, big brother boy

32
00:01:05.066 --> 00:01:06.500
You're lucky this time

33
00:01:06.566 --> 00:01:07.800
Scared me to death

34
00:01:15.933 --> 00:01:18.233
Stop, don't be afraid of a firecracker

35
00:01:27.566 --> 00:01:29.166
Why are they all back?

36
00:01:31.966 --> 00:01:33.166
Borrowing to handle the case

37
00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.400
Lock down the scene
