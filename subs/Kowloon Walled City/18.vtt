00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:01.833
No one's leaving today

2
00:00:03.466 --> 00:00:05.066
Gu Linger, run away

3
00:00:05.066 --> 00:00:07.166
Didn't you run pretty damn well just now?

4
00:00:07.166 --> 00:00:08.133
Let me tell you something.

5
00:00:08.133 --> 00:00:09.600
Even if you fucking run away

6
00:00:10.066 --> 00:00:11.066
Who the hell are you?

7
00:00:11.066 --> 00:00:13.300
Crouching Tiger Villa Storage Style

8
00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:16.466
Who the hell am I?

9
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:17.433
Hahaha

10
00:00:17.466 --> 00:00:20.166
It turned out to be a dog raised by Brother Gu Cheng.

11
00:00:20.166 --> 00:00:23.533
Then I'll kill your daughter first.

12
00:00:23.533 --> 00:00:27.200
It should be regarded as a meeting gift for Boss Hu's appeal.

13
00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.466
Kill him for me

14
00:00:28.466 --> 00:00:31.000
Hey, hahahahaha, hey.

15
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:33.400
Mr. Lin, right?

16
00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.466
Hiding it from today

17
00:00:35.466 --> 00:00:36.666
Give me face

18
00:00:36.733 --> 00:00:39.133
All expenses are paid by me

19
00:00:39.133 --> 00:00:41.000
Calm down, calm down, hahaha

20
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.633
Take it off your mother

21
00:00:43.466 --> 00:00:44.766
Which onion are you?

22
00:00:44.766 --> 00:00:45.500
Go away

23
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.266
Hey, Mr. Lin

24
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.500
I know the rules

25
00:00:49.533 --> 00:00:51.700
Make a price, make a price, right?

26
00:00:52.133 --> 00:00:55.833
Haha he fucking asked me for money hahahaha

27
00:00:55.966 --> 00:00:58.033
Ouch, listen.

28
00:00:58.366 --> 00:01:00.900
Money is shit to me

29
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:02.066
What you want is face

30
00:01:02.066 --> 00:01:03.766
Face, hey, hey, hey.

31
00:01:04.133 --> 00:01:05.200
Can be beaten to death

32
00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:06.966
Oh, don't hurt your peace.

33
00:01:06.966 --> 00:01:08.000
Let's see who dares

34
00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:10.866
Ok you little brat

35
00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:12.800
Tie a few broken detonators, who are you scaring?

36
00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.466
I can mix to where I am today

37
00:01:14.466 --> 00:01:16.266
Are you afraid of your tricks?

38
00:01:16.266 --> 00:01:17.366
Since you don't want to live

39
00:01:17.366 --> 00:01:18.666
Then die together
