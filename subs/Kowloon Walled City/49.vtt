00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:01.866
Pack it together and take it away.

2
00:00:01.866 --> 00:00:05.300
Said that the ancient city bear is now the number one target for carry

3
00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:06.200
He wanted to run.

4
00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:09.666
But all his assets have been frozen

5
00:00:09.666 --> 00:00:10.800
I heard from my subordinates

6
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.866
He is sending Fenglin Tiger to

7
00:00:12.866 --> 00:00:14.966
Selling his property stall

8
00:00:14.966 --> 00:00:16.366
He wants to cash out as soon as possible

9
00:00:16.366 --> 00:00:18.533
Wow, what a surprise!

10
00:00:18.533 --> 00:00:21.033
Once the powerful chief of the southern province

11
00:00:21.166 --> 00:00:23.700
Now it's reduced to selling property everywhere

12
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:24.833
Begging everywhere

13
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.366
Oh, it seems that fate is really tricking people

14
00:00:28.766 --> 00:00:30.066
Mr. Li

15
00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:33.400
Our Qiangsheng Group Bedde Ancient City has suppressed the whole

16
00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:34.966
Ten years?

17
00:00:34.966 --> 00:00:36.566
How much have we suffered?

18
00:00:36.566 --> 00:00:37.566
How much blood was shed?

19
00:00:37.566 --> 00:00:39.700
How many brothers died?

20
00:00:39.933 --> 00:00:43.366
We have to settle the account with him

21
00:00:43.366 --> 00:00:45.366
Does your sister-in-law have an idea again?

22
00:00:45.366 --> 00:00:47.200
Mr. Li, I think we are like this

23
00:00:49.666 --> 00:00:53.200
Haha, it seems that your kid is a fucking genius.

24
00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.533
Hey, it's all Mr. Lin, what's your name?

25
00:00:55.533 --> 00:00:57.600
Then I'll leave this to you.

26
00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.833
If you can do it to Wu Chengxiong

27
00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.866
My Wu Villa is under your fucking control

28
00:01:02.866 --> 00:01:05.466
Really? I'll do it now.

29
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.766
Big brother finally used the seller.

30
00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:12.933
It's been sealed recently

31
00:01:12.933 --> 00:01:14.800
The old owners are afraid that the tree will attract the wind

32
00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:16.433
I dare not take our stall.

33
00:01:16.466 --> 00:01:18.466
Those who dare to take risks become stars again

34
00:01:18.466 --> 00:01:19.766
The price is ridiculously low.

35
00:01:19.933 --> 00:01:21.200
It seems that this boy

36
00:01:21.466 --> 00:01:23.200
Those who dare to take the order are the only guns

37
00:01:23.366 --> 00:01:26.100
I suspect that my ancient city is overbearing

38
00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.466
In the end, you have to sell your retainers

39
00:01:28.666 --> 00:01:29.500
Go ahead.

40
00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:31.833
Who is it? Strong Group

41
00:01:32.733 --> 00:01:34.000
Lin Shengqiang
