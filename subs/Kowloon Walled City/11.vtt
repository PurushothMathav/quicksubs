00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:01.800
Oh my god

2
00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:03.800
If you hadn't eaten inside and out that day

3
00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:05.233
We have so many brothers

4
00:00:05.333 --> 00:00:07.400
How could it be taken away by all the forbidden guards?

5
00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:08.366
You fart

6
00:00:08.366 --> 00:00:11.166
I really know people and don't know my heart, big brother.

7
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.000
There is only one undercover agent in the world

8
00:00:13.266 --> 00:00:14.433
That's Hugh God

9
00:00:15.266 --> 00:00:16.766
Hahahaha

10
00:00:16.766 --> 00:00:20.066
Hello, Green

11
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.500
You really opened my eyes

12
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.966
Big brother hasn't sprayed blood yet

13
00:00:24.966 --> 00:00:26.866
Don't be fooled.

14
00:00:28.466 --> 00:00:30.933
Brother, I have been with you for ten years

15
00:00:30.933 --> 00:00:32.066
The blood of the world can be learned

16
00:00:32.266 --> 00:00:34.900
Heaven and earth conscience, big brother hahaha

17
00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:36.300
It's still there

18
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.100
You told me yourself that you have been a dog for ten years

19
00:00:39.166 --> 00:00:42.200
I have long wanted to take the second generation of my eldest brother and eat them

20
00:00:43.133 --> 00:00:44.766
I kind of figured it out

21
00:00:44.766 --> 00:00:46.300
You collude one by one

22
00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:47.900
Just to mess with me, right?

23
00:00:48.666 --> 00:00:49.466
Humph

24
00:00:50.933 --> 00:00:52.600
Put the words here today

25
00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.266
You're messing with people you shouldn't mess with

26
00:00:54.266 --> 00:00:56.766
This is me fighting four streets

27
00:00:56.766 --> 00:00:58.566
The injury I carried for my eldest brother back then

28
00:00:58.566 --> 00:01:00.966
This is me at Crouching Tiger Villa

29
00:01:00.966 --> 00:01:03.100
Barehanded and the Axe Gang

30
00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.200
There is also a wound on my back on the opposite side

31
00:01:05.366 --> 00:01:07.100
Qiangsheng Group wants to turn against the water

32
00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:08.866
None of my brothers came out

33
00:01:09.566 --> 00:01:11.600
I don't even know my life in the villa

34
00:01:12.066 --> 00:01:14.333
You are not the undercover, you are the undercover

35
00:01:14.333 --> 00:01:16.966
Big brother and second master have a life-threatening relationship with us

36
00:01:16.966 --> 00:01:19.033
We all believe in the second brother

37
00:01:19.066 --> 00:01:20.600
Don't hit the forest.

38
00:01:20.666 --> 00:01:22.900
We must severely punish the storage maniac

39
00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:24.066
You want to fight me?

40
00:01:24.166 --> 00:01:25.433
You made a little trouble

41
00:01:25.466 --> 00:01:27.766
Not before doesn't mean not now

42
00:01:28.066 --> 00:01:29.766
Carry can be found today

43
00:01:29.766 --> 00:01:34.366
This means that the undercover agent must have a cat on him

44
00:01:34.366 --> 00:01:37.400
Brother Zhong said that Shanbao confiscated a piece of facial tissue from you

45
00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.833
The undercover must die today
