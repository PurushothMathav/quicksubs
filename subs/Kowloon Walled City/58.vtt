00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:01.100
Stop

2
00:00:03.133 --> 00:00:06.300
Boss Gu is on time enough, Dad

3
00:00:06.466 --> 00:00:07.700
Save Cao Fuheng

4
00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:08.733
I warn you

5
00:00:08.733 --> 00:00:10.133
Let them go first

6
00:00:10.133 --> 00:00:11.833
Don't challenge my bottom line

7
00:00:12.666 --> 00:00:13.766
I say you

8
00:00:13.766 --> 00:00:15.300
So old

9
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:16.400
Dude, don't be that big.

10
00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.200
Don't you just want me to let them go?

11
00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.900
Yes, give me a good talk

12
00:00:21.166 --> 00:00:24.800
13 out of the stall, even people and goods will give you an offer.

13
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.166
Big happy or old and understand me

14
00:00:28.166 --> 00:00:29.666
So I'm going to cut to the chase.

15
00:00:29.666 --> 00:00:32.000
For the sake of our more than ten years of friendship

16
00:00:32.166 --> 00:00:35.400
I give this number 200,000

17
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.900
200,000 you think too much

18
00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:40.900
I paid two dollars.

19
00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:42.266
Hahahaha

20
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:48.100
Take it, it's a lot

21
00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:53.133
Hey you old thing

22
00:00:53.133 --> 00:00:54.566
Don't be stupid

23
00:00:54.566 --> 00:00:56.966
Your daughter is in my hands now. Hmm.

24
00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.166
Take it!

25
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.800
Hey

26
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.100
Cousin

27
00:01:07.466 --> 00:01:10.800
Hahahahaha, I am the king of the ancient times

28
00:01:10.966 --> 00:01:13.400
In the history of the South for more than ten years

29
00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:14.500
Can suffer

30
00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.066
You can break the port eye and swallow it in your stomach

31
00:01:17.266 --> 00:01:19.866
But who challenges my bottom line?

32
00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:21.433
He has to pay with his life

33
00:01:21.666 --> 00:01:24.133
Hey, you can take my place.

34
00:01:24.133 --> 00:01:25.566
You can take my seat

35
00:01:25.566 --> 00:01:27.700
But you let him go like a man

36
00:01:27.733 --> 00:01:29.133
One-on-one with me

37
00:01:29.133 --> 00:01:32.633
Do you dare to act like a man?

38
00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.366
Old thing hum

39
00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.666
In fact, I will give you a chance to come
