00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.966
You want to steal the beam and change the column?

2
00:00:01.966 --> 00:00:02.733
What do you mean?

3
00:00:02.733 --> 00:00:05.066
What do you mean? Don't you understand?

4
00:00:05.066 --> 00:00:07.466
This vase is very important to me

5
00:00:07.466 --> 00:00:09.933
How can you prove the one in your hand

6
00:00:09.933 --> 00:00:11.000
It's not mine.

7
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.400
You were just fighting with Lin Shangxiang for the vase, right?

8
00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.766
Yes!

9
00:00:13.766 --> 00:00:15.766
Did it fall on the table during the scramble?

10
00:00:15.766 --> 00:00:16.166
Yes!

11
00:00:16.166 --> 00:00:18.300
Is there a crack when you fall under the table?

12
00:00:19.466 --> 00:00:20.366
There will be cracks.

13
00:00:20.366 --> 00:00:21.533
Then it's over

14
00:00:21.533 --> 00:00:23.300
Dragon boy, this is my vase.

15
00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.000
Hey no no no no no no

16
00:00:25.133 --> 00:00:26.066
I'm asking

17
00:00:26.066 --> 00:00:27.133
Why do you prove it?

18
00:00:27.133 --> 00:00:28.700
The one in your hand is yours.

19
00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:30.600
Don't deny it if you fell yourself.

20
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:31.766
I fell

21
00:00:31.766 --> 00:00:34.433
When will I thank Long Zai for doing justice?

22
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:35.600
Stop

23
00:00:36.466 --> 00:00:37.266
Stop

24
00:00:43.266 --> 00:00:45.833
Take everyone away

25
00:00:45.933 --> 00:00:47.800
Everyone, Aunt Dragon

26
00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.300
Isn't this problem already solved?

27
00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:50.533
Why is this happening?

28
00:00:50.533 --> 00:00:51.866
This hasn't been solved yet.

29
00:00:52.533 --> 00:00:56.300
Take this away, don't send you away

30
00:00:58.266 --> 00:01:00.133
Ha Zhiqiang, you are in the territory

31
00:01:00.133 --> 00:01:03.333
All crimes committed overseas are recorded

32
00:01:03.333 --> 00:01:05.600
Your trial is in three days

33
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.100
Is there anything else you want to say?

34
00:01:07.166 --> 00:01:10.100
Hahahahaha

35
00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:14.866
Now I just want to see my lawyer

36
00:01:14.966 --> 00:01:15.933
Before we met him?

37
00:01:15.933 --> 00:01:17.533
I won't say anything ok

38
00:01:17.533 --> 00:01:19.766
Don't worry, he's on his way.

39
00:01:19.766 --> 00:01:21.600
He also asked me to give you a message

40
00:01:21.866 --> 00:01:25.400
Don't expect him to help

41
00:01:26.066 --> 00:01:30.033
Ah oh sorry sir dragon

42
00:01:30.366 --> 00:01:32.166
No no no dragon lord

43
00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:33.866
I am a wronged man

44
00:01:33.866 --> 00:01:35.433
Dragon Si, your takeaway has arrived.

45
00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:38.066
takeout

46
00:01:39.566 --> 00:01:40.800
It's Qianlong
