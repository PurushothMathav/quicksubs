00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:01.366
What job?

2
00:00:01.366 --> 00:00:03.966
Why don't I know, big brother, hahaha.

3
00:00:03.966 --> 00:00:05.300
These are extraordinary times.

4
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:06.600
I'm afraid it's too dangerous

5
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:07.633
So as soon as possible

6
00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:10.100
As long as you have physical rights

7
00:00:10.166 --> 00:00:11.933
Nothing I can't solve

8
00:00:11.933 --> 00:00:13.600
Come on, lie down, house

9
00:00:15.566 --> 00:00:16.500
Hey

10
00:00:18.133 --> 00:00:22.133
Crazy, this time I'm here to apologize

11
00:00:22.133 --> 00:00:24.866
Brother, I know you are in trouble too

12
00:00:24.866 --> 00:00:27.000
We don't talk about that between brothers

13
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.333
Ok hahaha don't talk about that

14
00:00:29.333 --> 00:00:31.433
Ok hahaha oops

15
00:00:31.566 --> 00:00:33.766
You two big men are so mushy

16
00:00:33.766 --> 00:00:36.466
Ah hahahaha, that's right.

17
00:00:36.466 --> 00:00:38.066
I almost forgot the big thing

18
00:00:38.133 --> 00:00:40.000
No son is here, big brother

19
00:00:46.066 --> 00:00:48.700
This is the big brother who went to buy gifts with me early in the morning.

20
00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:50.333
Just wanted to give you a birthday surprise

21
00:00:50.333 --> 00:00:52.533
I'm just a precious girl like you

22
00:00:52.533 --> 00:00:55.300
Can we forget your birthday, hahaha?

23
00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.000
I also prepared a mysterious gift for you.

24
00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.400
Why don't you rest first?

25
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.466
Ahahaha

26
00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.166
Hahaha, discuss it?

27
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.366
What ghost treasure show is Furucheng Xiong talking about again?

28
00:01:07.733 --> 00:01:09.433
What a surprise, Dad

29
00:01:13.266 --> 00:01:15.733
You have to take this with you.

30
00:01:15.733 --> 00:01:17.333
Don't tell anyone

31
00:01:17.333 --> 00:01:19.100
Dad, what necklace is this?

32
00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:20.066
It's pretty.

33
00:01:20.066 --> 00:01:21.466
To tell you the truth

34
00:01:21.466 --> 00:01:25.366
This necklace is Dad's expensive golden key for insurance.

35
00:01:25.366 --> 00:01:28.500
It's the result of Dad's life's hard work

36
00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:29.400
As long as you take it

37
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.666
He will be well-fed and clothed for the rest of his life

38
00:01:32.666 --> 00:01:35.200
Dad, why are you saying it so sad?

39
00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.766
You haven't grown a year older

40
00:01:36.766 --> 00:01:38.433
Dad is a year older

41
00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:39.900
Let's not talk about that.

42
00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.600
Go back and take care of the lunatic

43
00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.566
Dad has to go back to work
