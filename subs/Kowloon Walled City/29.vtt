00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.000
This lot has been bought by an off-market buyer.

2
00:00:03.566 --> 00:00:05.500
Is there someone else on the street?

3
00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:06.833
Or am I exposed?

4
00:00:06.933 --> 00:00:08.533
The auction is over

5
00:00:08.533 --> 00:00:10.633
All VIPs please leave in an orderly manner

6
00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:12.466
Finally gone

7
00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.666
Ok hum

8
00:00:15.666 --> 00:00:18.766
Who the hell dares to steal things from me?

9
00:00:18.766 --> 00:00:21.733
Who the hell bought it?

10
00:00:21.733 --> 00:00:24.433
It was bought anonymously by an off-market buyer

11
00:00:24.533 --> 00:00:27.000
I don't deserve to know, stop talking shit

12
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.466
I don't care who the hell bought it

13
00:00:28.466 --> 00:00:29.866
I'll take this vase.

14
00:00:29.866 --> 00:00:33.100
Did you hear the dragon? Let's go

15
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:34.966
Don't move like that

16
00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.266
Brother Tibetan Feng, let's go

17
00:00:37.266 --> 00:00:39.633
We can't get this vase today, don't worry.

18
00:00:39.866 --> 00:00:41.233
Let the bullets fly a little longer

19
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:43.366
Take away

20
00:00:47.266 --> 00:00:49.600
Wait for Hargo

21
00:00:49.766 --> 00:00:51.166
He actually came to connect in person

22
00:00:51.166 --> 00:00:53.800
Hahahahaha

23
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.033
Isn't this Mr. Lin?

24
00:00:56.166 --> 00:00:57.500
It's nice to meet you.

25
00:00:57.533 --> 00:01:00.200
We meet again today

26
00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:01.833
Who am I?

27
00:01:02.566 --> 00:01:05.633
Brother, hahaha, what's the matter?

28
00:01:07.566 --> 00:01:10.333
Pasta, I'm here to pick it up, sir.

29
00:01:10.333 --> 00:01:11.933
Your goods were taken by them.

30
00:01:11.933 --> 00:01:14.166
It's you who's been making trouble for a long time

31
00:01:14.166 --> 00:01:15.833
Come, come, let me tell you

32
00:01:15.966 --> 00:01:17.000
This bottle must be ordered

33
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.600
If you don't want to get beat up, get out of here

34
00:01:19.766 --> 00:01:21.600
Haha, uncle, this vase is very important to me.

35
00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:22.766
Can you buy me?

36
00:01:22.766 --> 00:01:23.733
How much do I pay?

37
00:01:23.733 --> 00:01:25.500
Linger, hey

38
00:01:25.566 --> 00:01:27.066
Crazy! What are you doing here?

39
00:01:27.066 --> 00:01:28.600
You two must stay out of this matter

40
00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:29.866
Quickly take Linger out of here

41
00:01:29.866 --> 00:01:31.600
Come on

42
00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.866
Mr. Lin is really sorry

43
00:01:33.866 --> 00:01:37.266
Because this vase is also very important to me.
