Huabo Succession Cooperation Investigation

2
00:00:07.533 --> 00:00:10.400
Oh, it turned out to be Lord Long Si Long, ha, hey.

3
00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.400
We are conducting normal transactions today.

4
00:00:13.466 --> 00:00:15.266
Hey, why are you even alerted?

5
00:00:15.266 --> 00:00:17.266
Hey, look at the normal transaction.

6
00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.400
Yes you call these normal transactions

7
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:21.200
Hey

8
00:00:21.733 --> 00:00:23.900
Because the goods are more popular.

9
00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.366
So there was some spat. Ha, oops.

10
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.233
You are so outrageous

11
00:00:29.333 --> 00:00:30.533
Hey, Long Si

12
00:00:30.533 --> 00:00:32.400
Take them all away if you see fit

13
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.500
If anyone is not convinced, just pack up OK

14
00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:35.700
I warn you

15
00:00:35.733 --> 00:00:36.933
Better come clean

16
00:00:36.933 --> 00:00:40.600
After I tried it, the nature was different

17
00:00:40.766 --> 00:00:43.366
Hahahahahaha Aunt Dragon

18
00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.200
We are all serious business people

19
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.466
You can rest assured.

20
00:00:46.466 --> 00:00:47.400
serious beneficiary

21
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.866
Yes, yes, yes, will the serious income person rob me of the vase?

22
00:00:49.866 --> 00:00:51.466
Let me tell you something.

23
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.733
You are not allowed to spill blood, sir Long

24
00:00:53.733 --> 00:00:54.600
Not as he said

25
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.933
I bought this junk for real money.

26
00:00:56.933 --> 00:00:58.200
So what's going on?

27
00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.066
Long sir, are you optimistic?

28
00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.300
This guy, he only took a picture of one vase.

29
00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:03.600
But he has to take two

30
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.133
One of these is mine.

31
00:01:05.133 --> 00:01:06.200
He didn't just want to steal my vase

32
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.500
Threatening me with a gun

33
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.166
Men, you are not allowed to talk nonsense

34
00:01:09.166 --> 00:01:09.966
Hey.

35
00:01:10.533 --> 00:01:11.966
What the hell is this?

36
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.633
This is

37
00:01:14.733 --> 00:01:16.333
This is a misunderstanding.

38
00:01:16.333 --> 00:01:18.666
Hahahahaha Long Si'er ahaha

39
00:01:18.666 --> 00:01:20.566
Then didn't you mean these two vases?

40
00:01:20.566 --> 00:01:21.566
Is one actually yours?

41
00:01:21.566 --> 00:01:22.566
Right?

42
00:01:22.566 --> 00:01:24.500
Then can you take yours with you?

43
00:01:30.166 --> 00:01:31.966
This is a vase with a crack in the lower right corner.

44
00:01:35.666 --> 00:01:37.033
This is yours.

45
00:01:40.566 --> 00:01:43.600
Crazy, you don't want to steal the beam and change the pillar, do you?
