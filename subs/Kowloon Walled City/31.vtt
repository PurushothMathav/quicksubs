00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.166
Crazy, where's the bottle just now?

2
00:00:03.266 --> 00:00:04.400
fuck

3
00:00:05.566 --> 00:00:07.466
Why are you shouting so loudly?

4
00:00:07.466 --> 00:00:09.500
Did you know you were so taken aback?

5
00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:11.366
It's too embarrassing for me to be the big brother

6
00:00:11.366 --> 00:00:12.700
Say what's the matter bro

7
00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:15.666
Two identical bottles what?

8
00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:18.900
Stretch out your hands without looking

9
00:00:23.766 --> 00:00:25.700
I asked you to show me your hands.

10
00:00:30.666 --> 00:00:32.366
I rely on the prodigal son to pay attention

11
00:00:32.366 --> 00:00:34.300
Exactly the same. What's going on here?

12
00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:37.433
Say, Uncle Ha, be merciful

13
00:00:37.666 --> 00:00:39.400
Brother Cao Meng just wants this bottle so much

14
00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:40.900
Don't worry, he'll be fine.

15
00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:44.166
You are a ghost, brother, you misunderstood me.

16
00:00:44.166 --> 00:00:45.333
Did I misunderstand you?

17
00:00:45.333 --> 00:00:46.266
You tell me the truth

18
00:00:46.266 --> 00:00:47.100
Who sent you?

19
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.366
Uncle, don't talk

20
00:00:48.366 --> 00:00:50.100
I know if you don't say it.

21
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.066
Two identical bottles, right?

22
00:00:52.066 --> 00:00:54.566
You kid want to switch bags, come here

23
00:00:55.966 --> 00:00:57.866
Pack both bottles and take them away.

24
00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:01.033
loosen

25
00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.766
Crazy you know someone told me

26
00:01:05.866 --> 00:01:08.500
Said as long as it was his people who wanted the bottle

27
00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:09.833
Just let me kill him

28
00:01:10.533 --> 00:01:11.333
Ah!

29
00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.433
Brother Cangfeng, please explain quickly

30
00:01:13.966 --> 00:01:17.100
It's too late to explain now

31
00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.966
Go down and explain it to Yama by yourself

32
00:01:20.166 --> 00:01:21.466
Everyone is not allowed to move

33
00:01:21.466 --> 00:01:22.500
Hands on your head
