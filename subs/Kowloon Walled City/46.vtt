00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:03.466
Does big brother really not protect Ling'er?

2
00:00:03.466 --> 00:00:04.866
Wherever Linger is

3
00:00:04.866 --> 00:00:07.133
I won't let him get hurt in any way

4
00:00:07.133 --> 00:00:09.500
Don't worry, I will arrange your itinerary immediately.

5
00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:11.566
There will be no trouble when you are out of town.

6
00:00:11.566 --> 00:00:12.866
It's not urgent

7
00:00:12.866 --> 00:00:15.266
This time it's tricky.

8
00:00:15.266 --> 00:00:16.700
Zhiqiang this old dog

9
00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:19.233
I didn't expect him to be Mr. Long Xiaoyun

10
00:00:19.733 --> 00:00:21.766
Give me all overseas accounts frozen

11
00:00:21.766 --> 00:00:24.700
Even if we go out without a penny in the account

12
00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:25.266
What to do then?

13
00:00:25.266 --> 00:00:26.300
Big Brother Beard

14
00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:27.466
I was going to

15
00:00:27.466 --> 00:00:30.066
I want you to continue to manage the estate of the villa

16
00:00:30.066 --> 00:00:33.300
But now it seems that we can only survive

17
00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:34.600
Hope you understand

18
00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.233
How many production stalls do you want to sell?

19
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.100
No.

20
00:00:37.333 --> 00:00:39.600
All the stalls are sold.

21
00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:40.800
I listen to you

22
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.500
Hello big brother

23
00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.266
I've been checking hard recently.

24
00:00:44.266 --> 00:00:45.300
I can't show up

25
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.000
You go and meet all the main departments now

26
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.400
Talk to them about it.

27
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:50.800
There is only one principle

28
00:00:50.933 --> 00:00:52.833
Shoot as soon as possible understand

29
00:00:56.666 --> 00:00:58.733
Why is Long Xiaoyun storing here?

30
00:00:58.733 --> 00:01:00.866
Wind, I know you're awake

31
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:02.466
Stop pretending, get up

32
00:01:03.333 --> 00:01:04.600
Oh, Dragon Four.

33
00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:06.400
I'm a patient now, okay?

34
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:07.566
Need to rest

35
00:01:07.566 --> 00:01:08.533
Why are you in such a hurry?

36
00:01:08.533 --> 00:01:09.466
Remind me

37
00:01:09.566 --> 00:01:11.166
Declare in advance.

38
00:01:11.166 --> 00:01:12.733
I don't speak for the guards.

39
00:01:12.733 --> 00:01:15.400
I came to visit purely out of personal reasons

40
00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.900
What's the relationship?
