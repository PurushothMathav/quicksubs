Don't underestimate what's coming at me

3
00:00:07.866 --> 00:00:09.366
What is embarrassing my wife?

4
00:00:09.566 --> 00:00:10.900
Okay, okay.

5
00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:13.066
Give me your bitter drama

6
00:00:13.066 --> 00:00:14.333
I'm going to ask you one last thing.

7
00:00:14.333 --> 00:00:17.266
Do you now recognize that you are an undercover agent appointed by Jin?

8
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:18.466
Is it a demon?

9
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:19.866
So what if I am?

10
00:00:19.866 --> 00:00:22.700
Hahaha, do you treat undercover?

11
00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:24.366
There was only one solution.

12
00:00:24.366 --> 00:00:27.100
Is to have the guards execute them on the spot

13
00:00:27.133 --> 00:00:28.600
As for your wife?

14
00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:31.266
I can take it home for human experimentation

15
00:00:31.266 --> 00:00:33.366
Hahaha let me go

16
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.100
Did Cao Cao see it?

17
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.400
Mr. Ji is already angry

18
00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:37.800
If you are not honest

19
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.600
You would rather die than live.

20
00:00:41.866 --> 00:00:43.366
The police have sent a message and are ready to fight

21
00:00:43.366 --> 00:00:44.966
Yes fast

22
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.000
That's right, I'm Huaguo Jingwei, very handsome

29

Today, people and things are difficult

30
00:01:04.966 --> 00:01:06.400
See where else you want to run

31
00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.766
Enough shit

32
00:01:08.866 --> 00:01:12.000
