1
00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.166
Extremely low cost and risk

2
00:00:02.333 --> 00:00:04.500
Lamb, don't talk nonsense

3
00:00:04.733 --> 00:00:06.100
Ass like you

4
00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:07.633
What better technique could there be?

5
00:00:08.133 --> 00:00:08.933
Plateau

6
00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.433
If you have a better plan

7
00:00:11.466 --> 00:00:13.400
Cui is willing to listen

8
00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.766
But I advise you to be cautious

9
00:00:16.866 --> 00:00:19.433
Your Majesty is not easy to fool

10
00:00:19.733 --> 00:00:21.500
This dog man and woman

11
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.333
It's really a harmony

12
00:00:23.333 --> 00:00:25.666
See how I punch you in the face

13
00:00:26.066 --> 00:00:27.700
Standing on the tea

14
00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:29.233
Their goal was simple.

15
00:00:29.466 --> 00:00:32.300
It is to hire people to clear the wasteland at the fastest speed and at a low price

16
00:00:32.366 --> 00:00:35.033
But the local people are mostly lazy

17
00:00:35.266 --> 00:00:36.833
Clearing wasteland is hard and tiring

18
00:00:36.866 --> 00:00:38.900
Tea merchants have no local prestige

19
00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:40.966
Even if you pay a high price to hire someone

20
00:00:40.966 --> 00:00:44.766
Then the common people will only fish for three days and dry the net for two days

21
00:00:45.533 --> 00:00:46.833
That's the truth

22
00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:48.966
So how do you do it?

23
00:00:48.966 --> 00:00:50.266
To achieve the goal

24
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.466
Then you can only play with human nature

25
00:00:52.466 --> 00:00:53.966
The grass-roots method is simple

26
00:00:53.966 --> 00:00:55.566
You only need to do one game.

27
00:00:55.566 --> 00:00:58.466
The grass-roots people are willing to call it a play

28
00:01:00.066 --> 00:01:02.800
How to play with human nature

29
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.566
How to decide

30
00:01:04.566 --> 00:01:06.033
Caomin is a tea merchant

31
00:01:06.133 --> 00:01:09.166
It will be three times or five times the price first.

32
00:01:09.166 --> 00:01:11.433
Hire a dozen people to clear the wasteland first

33
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.900
Guarding the North Hunan Army

34
00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:16.233
What else is there?

35
00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.100
That's all

36
00:01:19.166 --> 00:01:22.266
I thought you would come up with something

37
00:01:22.266 --> 00:01:23.166
Here it is.

38
00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.266
I don't know what kind of son you are?

39
00:01:28.733 --> 00:01:31.000
I just got hit by you.

40
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.300
This is it.

41
00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:33.500
Can't answer

42
00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.566
If the price is high, it will be in stock.

43
00:01:35.866 --> 00:01:37.300
Calm down, everybody.

44
00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:42.033
A few days before I finish speaking, let the people gather and speak

45
00:01:42.366 --> 00:01:44.400
If people are lazy and sleep

46
00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:45.433
Despite scolding

47
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Anxious face

48
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.700
Try to pretend like a person

49
00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.733
Local people are lazy

50
00:01:50.733 --> 00:01:52.600
Mostly just and yin

51
00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:53.766
In their eyes

52
00:01:53.766 --> 00:01:55.333
I was jumping up and down.

53
00:01:55.333 --> 00:01:57.500
Even like a funny beard

54
00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.966
And laugh at me behind my back

55
00:01:59.966 --> 00:02:02.033
Then go on your own way

56
00:02:02.933 --> 00:02:04.966
But a few days later

57
00:02:04.966 --> 00:02:09.600
I'll bury a few gold in this barren mountain

58
00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:10.466
This Season

59
00:02:11.133 --> 00:02:12.433
Just do it.
