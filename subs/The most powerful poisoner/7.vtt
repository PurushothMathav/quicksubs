1
00:00:00.066 --> 00:00:02.000
Enough haha of course

2
00:00:02.066 --> 00:00:04.500
You turn away, you turn back.

3
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.033
Just a joke

4
00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:08.700
If the grass-roots people really encounter this situation

5
00:00:08.733 --> 00:00:09.966
I will give him some silver taels.

6
00:00:09.966 --> 00:00:11.600
As General Wang Zhong said again

7
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:12.500
Leave a sentence

8
00:00:12.733 --> 00:00:16.500
Gao's broadsword will let him leave without cutting the young and the old

9
00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.500
This is what it looks like.

10
00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:23.566
Then the grass people will see where he goes to his relatives and friends

11
00:00:23.566 --> 00:00:25.600
Or picked up by someone

12
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.433
Destiny them again

13
00:00:28.933 --> 00:00:31.100
Of course he could have escaped

14
00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:33.200
But suddenly appeared in front of me

15
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.300
That's not true.

16
00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:36.566
Learn from the grass-roots people

17
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:38.900
Most likely a deception

18
00:00:39.066 --> 00:00:41.100
Under the bed of the house

19
00:00:41.166 --> 00:00:42.900
Wardrobe Takeoka

20
00:00:43.366 --> 00:00:45.866
Are there any younger siblings hidden?

21
00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.766
If there is a disease, get rid of it

22
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.066
You need to pay attention when you start

23
00:00:51.066 --> 00:00:53.666
The heart of a normal person is on the left

24
00:00:53.666 --> 00:00:56.300
There are also very few people who grow on the right

25
00:00:56.466 --> 00:00:57.833
To be on the safe side

26
00:00:58.533 --> 00:01:00.233
One on each side

27
00:01:05.133 --> 00:01:08.566
His Majesty's noble son cannot do what he says

28
00:01:08.566 --> 00:01:11.000
If his father knew how to eradicate weeds and roots

29
00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.066
There will be no exquisite disaster of extinction

30
00:01:13.666 --> 00:01:14.500
The end will be on standby

31
00:01:14.733 --> 00:01:17.000
Your Majesty, this son is so cruel

32
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.800
Is it the scourge of big money?

33
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.600
Killing weeds and uprooting spring waves

34
00:01:23.566 --> 00:01:25.233
If the child's father

35
00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.366
Eradicate the roots

36
00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.700
Is there any calamity today?

37
00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.200
This question I

38
00:01:34.266 --> 00:01:35.600
Very satisfied

39
00:01:38.866 --> 00:01:41.500
As expected of me, Kojiro's good eldest son

40
00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.400
Married 10 times with your father

41
00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.200
This first question is just my little test

42
00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.266
But you want to be my rich official

43
00:01:50.266 --> 00:01:51.766
plead for the people

44
00:01:51.866 --> 00:01:53.633
It's not that simple

45
00:01:54.266 --> 00:01:55.700
Please ask Your Majesty to ask the question

46
00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.966
The grass people are willing to be filial piety to His Majesty Ma Zhe

47
00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:02.566
This question is not just about the son of Kogo's waiter

48
00:02:02.566 --> 00:02:04.800
All the love ministers can speak freely

49
00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:06.433
Satisfied with the answer

50
00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.366
I will definitely reward

51
00:02:13.733 --> 00:02:15.166
You are a tea merchant

52
00:02:15.166 --> 00:02:18.900
A barren mountain in the backcountry of Jiangnan

53
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.366
Want to grow tea

54
00:02:20.366 --> 00:02:21.800
You have to open up the wasteland first

55
00:02:22.066 --> 00:02:24.833
But most of the local residents are lazy

56
00:02:25.066 --> 00:02:28.500
Even if a few residents are recruited to go up the mountain to clear the wasteland

57
00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.366
Mostly lazy

58
00:02:30.366 --> 00:02:33.700
But the time to plant tea is coming.

59
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.500
What do you do?

60
00:02:35.766 --> 00:02:37.700
Your Majesty, it's very simple

61
00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.500
Since there was no one before a generation of workers

62
00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.333
Then double and triple?

63
00:02:41.333 --> 00:02:42.300
That's it.

64
00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.766
Liang Xin has no people to open the emperor to you

65
00:02:45.566 --> 00:02:48.366
General Wang's remarks differ

66
00:02:48.366 --> 00:02:49.800
Even broken bones

67
00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:53.900
Then the pleasure of tripling gravity is certainly enjoyed by someone

68
00:02:53.966 --> 00:02:55.900
But it increases the cost significantly.

69
00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.266
Furthermore, I just said

70
00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.000
Even if you go up the mountain to open up the wasteland

71
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.933
Local residents are mostly lazy

72
00:03:01.933 --> 00:03:04.433
Tea merchants have no local roots

73
00:03:04.533 --> 00:03:05.866
Unchecked

74
00:03:05.933 --> 00:03:08.200
What should you do?

75
00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.200
Your Majesty, what does it mean to be inconsiderate?

76
00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:15.433
But Your Majesty, this question is too difficult when you are in the backwoods

77
00:03:15.533 --> 00:03:17.033
People are lazy by nature

78
00:03:17.333 --> 00:03:18.700
No salary increase

79
00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:20.500
There is no common people effect

80
00:03:20.766 --> 00:03:23.333
And laziness is human nature

81
00:03:23.333 --> 00:03:25.033
Since the mountains are secluded

82
00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:27.566
People are more passive and lazy

83
00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:30.700
Filial piety to Taigong is difficult to restrain

84
00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:31.600
Siping

85
00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:33.766
Mowgli?
