00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.066
Excuse me.

2
00:00:01.066 --> 00:00:02.166
Give way, give way, give way.

3
00:00:02.166 --> 00:00:03.566
My wife is in labor!

4
00:00:03.566 --> 00:00:05.666
Then you must come to drink the wedding wine

5
00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:07.466
Hey, this old Li

6
00:00:07.466 --> 00:00:08.933
Now it's a blessing

7
00:00:08.933 --> 00:00:10.866
We've had three kids.

8
00:00:11.133 --> 00:00:13.833
The folds on his smiling face can't close

9
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.133
Yeah.

10
00:00:15.133 --> 00:00:17.000
Who would dare to say that in the past?

11
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.866
It doesn't make sense

12
00:00:17.866 --> 00:00:19.100
Thanks to our Gao Dayuan

13
00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:20.333
Not only did they defeat the six countries

14
00:00:20.333 --> 00:00:21.900
Realized the great rule of the world

15
00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.166
Currency is also counted

16
00:00:23.166 --> 00:00:24.566
At the same time, the tax cover is reduced

17
00:00:24.566 --> 00:00:25.700
For our lives

18
00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:27.266
Received more high-quality benefits

19
00:00:27.266 --> 00:00:29.133
Hey, we common people

20
00:00:29.133 --> 00:00:31.000
Life is getting better now

21
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.866
I'm never hungry again haha

22
00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:34.333
Oh, what a tall Ren!

23
00:00:34.333 --> 00:00:37.066
It should be called the emperor now

24
00:00:37.866 --> 00:00:38.900
Yes, yes, look at my broken mouth

25
00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:41.466
You see, it should be His Majesty the Emperor

26
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.600
I didn't expect our empress, Her Majesty

27
00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.500
Would be willing to abdicate and give up

28
00:00:45.533 --> 00:00:47.200
Give up the throne to the emperor

29
00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.466
Behind the scenes in charge of six departments

30
00:00:49.766 --> 00:00:51.200
Our emperor?

31
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.666
It's really a blessing on earth

32
00:00:53.666 --> 00:00:56.366
This is what the emperor deserves

33
00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:01.666
The world is safe in high-rise temples

34
00:01:01.933 --> 00:01:05.666
Happy to have you as six fruits

35
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.033
From now on, life will be you

36
00:01:10.166 --> 00:01:11.000
not in

37
00:01:11.933 --> 00:01:12.733
almost

38
00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:17.200
The courier son grabs the courier.

39
00:01:18.333 --> 00:01:23.000
Oh, they all say that I am all literate and martial arts

40
00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.066
But I always feel that I have to take the early

41
00:01:25.066 --> 00:01:28.600
Study some pharmacology, husband

42
00:01:30.866 --> 00:01:33.700
Otherwise, I have to go out with a wall every day

43
00:01:33.733 --> 00:01:36.900
Sooner or later, I have to let it go back one day

44
00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.366
What nonsense do you hate?

45
00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:41.633
Back to the palace in a while

46
00:01:41.933 --> 00:01:44.400
Let's see how Wan'er and I deal with you

47
00:01:45.366 --> 00:01:48.400
How many lives have I learned recently?

48
00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.766
I don't know who bullies whom

49
00:01:51.866 --> 00:01:53.000
Hahahaha

50
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.866
Back to the palace haha
