00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:02.733
You've been scheming since you were a kid

2
00:00:02.733 --> 00:00:04.700
Eating lychees in public

3
00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:07.766
Hmph, it must be homework

4
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.400
Haha grandpa

5
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.800
This is indeed a bit heavier on the art of war

6
00:00:13.733 --> 00:00:14.900
Then say it.

7
00:00:16.166 --> 00:00:18.466
As the so-called military conspiracy

8
00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:19.666
Second penalty

9
00:00:19.666 --> 00:00:20.733
Secondly, punishment

10
00:00:20.733 --> 00:00:21.933
Siege under its banner

11
00:00:21.933 --> 00:00:23.000
Siege

12
00:00:23.066 --> 00:00:24.000
as a last resort

13
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:25.266
Hahahaha

14
00:00:25.266 --> 00:00:28.366
Good boy, the old man is really wrong

15
00:00:28.366 --> 00:00:29.300
You really don't understand

16
00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.266
I suggest you talk about it quickly

17
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.700
How to reduce the casualties of soldiers

18
00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.166
Take him fast

19
00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.966
First, when the two armies confront each other

20
00:00:37.966 --> 00:00:40.366
We will first send a few people to call horses under the city

21
00:00:40.366 --> 00:00:41.366
What problem?

22
00:00:41.366 --> 00:00:44.766
First, scold his wife

23
00:00:44.766 --> 00:00:45.866
Curse his ancestors again

24
00:00:45.866 --> 00:00:47.666
Then scold the ancestors of Emperor Chu

25
00:00:47.666 --> 00:00:49.900
Force them to send troops to pursue

26
00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:50.900
critical moment

27
00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.700
We sent an army out from the side

28
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:54.733
Defeat it

29
00:00:54.733 --> 00:00:56.300
In the official city

30
00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:57.166
OK

31
00:00:57.733 --> 00:01:00.766
This trick has indeed been used by many generals

32
00:01:00.766 --> 00:01:02.900
But it didn't work very well.

33
00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.800
This year, I can serve as a guard of 10%

34
00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.200
Hmph, I'm afraid I'm not mediocre

35
00:01:08.366 --> 00:01:11.466
Boy, now I see you are

36
00:01:11.466 --> 00:01:14.566
You're a shitbag with a gold edge, you

37
00:01:14.566 --> 00:01:16.900
Hahaha good boy

38
00:01:16.933 --> 00:01:18.700
You really scared the old man

39
00:01:19.066 --> 00:01:23.266
The old man thinks I really know Ding Fa, hahaha
