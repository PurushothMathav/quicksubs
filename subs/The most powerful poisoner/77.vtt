00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.166
grade submission

2
00:00:01.166 --> 00:00:02.500
Self is a dragon axe

3
00:00:02.566 --> 00:00:04.700
I used to know the art of witchcraft

4
00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:06.100
Before you do it

5
00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:07.666
A death row inmate can be arranged

6
00:00:07.666 --> 00:00:10.466
Expose that someone cursed His Majesty with a witch bone

7
00:00:10.733 --> 00:00:12.966
Your Majesty takes advantage of the situation to make the heart less strict

8
00:00:13.133 --> 00:00:15.766
Then smash down King Rongqing with a Hongmen banquet

9
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.366
Search Rongqing Palace

10
00:00:17.366 --> 00:00:19.466
Dig up dolls

11
00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:22.000
Even if the evidence is there

12
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.800
King Rong Qin has a hundred mouths

13
00:00:24.566 --> 00:00:26.166
The mouth of the condemned prisoner

14
00:00:26.166 --> 00:00:28.600
It will also become His Majesty's sharpest knife

15
00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.200
To solve the problem

16
00:00:30.966 --> 00:00:33.900
Fortunately, Lamb Birth Virus Kung Fu

17
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:36.066
Fortunately, the lamb is mine

18
00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.466
If the rebellious thieves get it

19
00:00:38.466 --> 00:00:40.200
Then I'm in danger

20
00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.566
I'm afraid the imperial power will protect the weak

21
00:00:42.566 --> 00:00:44.833
The country is not guaranteed

22
00:00:45.566 --> 00:00:47.366
The plan you mentioned

23
00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.000
No problem.

24
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.933
But Prince Rong did not die

25
00:00:50.933 --> 00:00:54.400
Does cutting grass not get rid of it and the spring breeze blows again?

26
00:00:54.733 --> 00:00:57.866
Your Majesty, you have misunderstood the meaning

27
00:00:59.333 --> 00:01:01.400
Misunderstand your majesty

28
00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.400
Have you ever remembered the household of Nie Men who assessed the ministers in the court?

29
00:01:05.866 --> 00:01:08.600
You mean Shouzhu.

30
00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.866
Waiting for Prince Rabbit Dragon to be thrown into prison

31
00:01:11.866 --> 00:01:13.833
His men will surely save

32
00:01:13.966 --> 00:01:16.900
His Majesty can set up a mansion in Tianjiao to defeat all his emperors

33
00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:19.600
As for Prince Rong, he is unhappy

34
00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.933
I am deeply sorry for the trust of His Majesty and the late Emperor

35
00:01:22.933 --> 00:01:24.333
Leave a suicide note

36
00:01:24.333 --> 00:01:25.966
Is that reasonable too?

37
00:01:28.933 --> 00:01:30.300
I know.

38
00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:31.966
Let me think about it.

39
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.800
The stakes are high.

40
00:01:33.933 --> 00:01:36.066
Can't walk, half the wind

41
00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:37.966
otherwise

42
00:01:38.666 --> 00:01:40.033
Kill without mercy
