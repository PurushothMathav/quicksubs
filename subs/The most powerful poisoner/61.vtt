1
00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.266
Father

2
00:00:01.266 --> 00:00:03.533
Yang'er wants to design Prince Rong

3
00:00:03.533 --> 00:00:05.500
Are we really not involved?

4
00:00:07.866 --> 00:00:10.133
King Rong Qin is already riding on the neck of our Gao family

5
00:00:10.133 --> 00:00:11.300
Shit on the stalk

6
00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:13.700
How can you let my high government bear it?

7
00:00:13.933 --> 00:00:14.966
Father

8
00:00:14.966 --> 00:00:16.333
I didn't mean that.

9
00:00:16.333 --> 00:00:17.600
Just a little worried

10
00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.733
After all, court struggles

11
00:00:19.733 --> 00:00:21.933
Once you win, you lose everything.

12
00:00:21.933 --> 00:00:23.666
But still too young

13
00:00:23.766 --> 00:00:24.933
The court is sinister

14
00:00:24.933 --> 00:00:26.500
Don't be careless, oops.

15
00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.066
You underestimate the sheep.

16
00:00:29.066 --> 00:00:30.266
A coincidence

17
00:00:30.333 --> 00:00:31.400
Two accidents

18
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.266
While the old man is still alive, someone will cover the bottom line

19
00:00:33.266 --> 00:00:35.533
Just practice the sheep's technique

20
00:00:35.533 --> 00:00:39.433
The three old men dream of good things

21
00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.000
Then I will transfer 1,000 taels of silver from the mansion and send it there.

22
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.966
What do you do with 1,000 taels of silver?

23
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.166
It's not my father who asked to dial 1,000 taels of silver

24
00:00:46.166 --> 00:00:48.133
Send it to the sheep to deal with King Rongqing?

25
00:00:48.133 --> 00:00:49.500
When did I say

26
00:00:50.066 --> 00:00:52.766
This tweezer is a liar even to his father

27
00:00:52.766 --> 00:00:55.600
Forget it, give it to him if he wants

28
00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.366
As long as you don't give the little girl surnamed Song the flowers, you won't put them down.

29
00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.500
Husband and wife

30
00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.233
I'll arrange it now.

31
00:01:04.733 --> 00:01:05.900
Tell it to go

32
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.866
The old man will gather friends to come to the mansion tomorrow to explore the art of war

33
00:01:09.866 --> 00:01:12.233
Let Yang Er stand aside in the backcourt to learn

34
00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:14.766
The descendants of my Gao family only understand poisons

35
00:01:14.933 --> 00:01:15.966
Don't know the art of war

36
00:01:15.966 --> 00:01:18.633
Wouldn't it be a joke if it got out?

37
00:01:19.466 --> 00:01:20.266
matter

38
00:01:28.933 --> 00:01:30.666
Miss, it's getting dark

39
00:01:30.666 --> 00:01:32.400
I'm afraid the Wailong won't come

40
00:01:32.466 --> 00:01:34.766
Miss Ben wrote him a letter herself

41
00:01:34.766 --> 00:01:36.600
According to the character of this lamb

42
00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.266
He must be precious

43
00:01:38.566 --> 00:01:39.800
Impossible not to come

44
00:01:47.166 --> 00:01:48.266
Miss

45
00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:49.966
Wait a minute.

46
00:01:50.066 --> 00:01:52.000
Maybe something is delayed.

47
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.200
Wait another hour.

48
00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:02.866
Did I remember it wrong?

49
00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:04.833
Not this big locust tree

50
00:02:04.966 --> 00:02:06.633
You send someone to inquire again

51
00:02:06.733 --> 00:02:09.700
See if anything is delayed. Okay.

52
00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:17.533
Miss Miss

53
00:02:17.533 --> 00:02:20.000
Not good, this servant took Dingguo Kung Fu around in a circle

54
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.200
Found this.

55
00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.500
Isn't this my letter to the lamb?

56
00:02:24.566 --> 00:02:26.566
Why does it feel like it's been eaten by a dog?

57
00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:27.900
Miss is right

58
00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.400
The slaves are outside the Dingguo Mansion

59
00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.300
Found this near the dog woman

60
00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:32.600
There are also dog prints on it

61
00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.900
For this letter, the servant was chased and bitten by a dog

62
00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.600
What kennel?

63
00:02:36.933 --> 00:02:39.666
Yes, and the servant asked around

64
00:02:39.733 --> 00:02:41.700
Since sometimes it's been electric

65
00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.300
No one comes out

66
00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:47.100
Miss, let's go back first, dog sheep.

67
00:02:48.533 --> 00:02:49.333
