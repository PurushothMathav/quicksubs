00:00:00.533 --> 00:00:03.233
Bring me the map of Linjiang City

2
00:00:12.566 --> 00:00:15.666
How is the grain in Linjiang City generally transported?

3
00:00:15.733 --> 00:00:18.066
Naturally, there are two methods of transportation: water and land.

4
00:00:18.066 --> 00:00:21.200
However, Linjiang City is known as the Qingshui River civilization

5
00:00:21.266 --> 00:00:22.733
More surface transportation

6
00:00:22.733 --> 00:00:24.366
Short time and low loss

7
00:00:24.366 --> 00:00:28.200
I don't know what good plan Mr. Gao has in mind

8
00:00:29.166 --> 00:00:31.933
The largest grain merchants in Linjiang City

9
00:00:31.933 --> 00:00:33.066
Lord Du knows

10
00:00:33.066 --> 00:00:35.333
Of course Zhao Qian

11
00:00:35.333 --> 00:00:36.466
Everyone of Anlin Temple

12
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.333
These four families have been talking about drama in Linjiang City for many years

13
00:00:39.333 --> 00:00:40.500
Powerful

14
00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:41.633
Take advantage of this national disaster

15
00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.733
It is crazy to sweep all the food in the city

16
00:00:44.733 --> 00:00:46.500
It also attracted some local small grain merchants

17
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:47.900
Farming bees with the same food

18
00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:50.900
It also caused food prices to drop in just a few decades

19
00:00:50.966 --> 00:00:52.400
Nearly tripled

20
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.033
But now His Majesty has just ascended the throne

21
00:00:55.266 --> 00:00:57.500
Linjiang City has a strong folk style

22
00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.000
It is not appropriate to forcibly suppress

23
00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.133
Otherwise there will be chaos

24
00:01:01.133 --> 00:01:04.400
No one can afford the consequences then

25
00:01:04.566 --> 00:01:05.433
OK

26
00:01:05.666 --> 00:01:08.900
Then ask Lord Du to prepare a table of good wine and food

27
00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.500
Help me entertain Zhao Qian and Han Lin four good businesspeople

28
00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.666
Mr. Gao is telling the truth

29
00:01:14.666 --> 00:01:16.733
This move has already been worked hard

30
00:01:16.733 --> 00:01:18.500
It just didn't work.

31
00:01:18.566 --> 00:01:19.600
Bone gravity

32
00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.100
Take this God-given opportunity to amass food

33
00:01:22.466 --> 00:01:25.800
How can you let go easily?

34
00:01:29.766 --> 00:01:31.233
You do it

35
00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:36.200
Then the lower official will depend on the means of the tall man

36
00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:44.266
Lord Gao, these Liangshan are all old foxes

37
00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.100
I want them to lower the price.

38
00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.333
That's probably harder than killing them

39
00:01:48.333 --> 00:01:49.566
They can talk

40
00:01:49.566 --> 00:01:50.866
Five characters minimum.

41
00:01:50.866 --> 00:01:53.100
Five words is already their limit

42
00:01:53.166 --> 00:01:56.100
Lord Du, be calm

43
00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.766
You are the parent officer on the front line

44
00:01:59.066 --> 00:02:00.700
You are in a mess

45
00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:02.466
How to comment on the price?

46
00:02:03.566 --> 00:02:04.400
Take the official

47
00:02:04.733 --> 00:02:07.400
Let's see what Master Gao does

48
00:02:08.066 --> 00:02:11.066
The four major families of Hanlian have arrived

49
00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:12.400
Ah!

50
00:02:13.066 --> 00:02:14.600
Ah, the four families.
