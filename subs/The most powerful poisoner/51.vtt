1
00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:02.166
Lamb Xiaoer, why are you here?

2
00:00:02.166 --> 00:00:05.166
You are also qualified to eat a court meeting

3
00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:06.100
lamb

4
00:00:06.966 --> 00:00:08.166
Nai Zhen Special Zhao

5
00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:12.400
Lamb Guanzhong big man locust eggs flooding

6
00:00:12.533 --> 00:00:14.133
Only disaster prevention appears

7
00:00:14.133 --> 00:00:15.600
What's your plan?

8
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.900
Your Majesty can only be a child of the emperor

9
00:00:18.966 --> 00:00:20.266
Never even met the emperor

10
00:00:20.266 --> 00:00:22.500
How could he possibly marry Huang Chong?

11
00:00:23.733 --> 00:00:24.900
I've been talking about it.

12
00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.666
All his blind boxes Wang Lao General

13
00:00:27.866 --> 00:00:29.966
A man's words are better than a daughter's

14
00:00:29.966 --> 00:00:32.200
Then it's a deal.

15
00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.733
This lamb has never even seen the imperial city

16
00:00:34.733 --> 00:00:37.266
I have dealt with the emperor's way

17
00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.066
Impossible absolutely impossible

18
00:00:45.466 --> 00:00:46.366
Your Majesty

19
00:00:46.366 --> 00:00:47.400
I have a plan

20
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.100
Or it can wipe out the entire Guanzhong yellow disaster

21
00:00:50.333 --> 00:00:53.166
Lamb, what can you say boldly?

22
00:00:53.166 --> 00:00:54.466
Don't worry about the consequences

23
00:00:54.466 --> 00:00:56.200
I and the people love you

24
00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:57.466
self-consideration

25
00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.333
That being the case, the minister put forward a few conditions

26
00:01:01.333 --> 00:01:02.700
But before that

27
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.133
I need to make sure

28
00:01:04.133 --> 00:01:06.366
The above-mentioned memorials of the sheriff of Guanzhong

29
00:01:06.366 --> 00:01:08.600
This yellow disaster has already broken out

30
00:01:08.733 --> 00:01:11.933
Or is it just a large number of eggs that have not yet exploded?

31
00:01:11.933 --> 00:01:13.433
It hasn't exploded yet.

32
00:01:13.533 --> 00:01:14.533
They're eggs.

33
00:01:14.533 --> 00:01:18.000
But it can make Liu Wu Shangshu let the court make countermeasures

34
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.633
This number must be

35
00:01:20.333 --> 00:01:23.800
Lord Gao, a large number of insect eggs will definitely break out in an insect plague

36
00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.600
And these eggs are buried deep in the ground and difficult to eradicate

37
00:01:26.666 --> 00:01:28.733
What's the difference between the two?

38
00:01:28.733 --> 00:01:30.966
Mr. Cui, you don't know something

39
00:01:30.966 --> 00:01:33.400
The difference is huge

40
00:01:33.533 --> 00:01:36.000
If flying yellow sweeps over the sky

41
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.933
There are few ways to deal with it

42
00:01:37.933 --> 00:01:39.400
You can only start from the disaster

43
00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.300
If only a large number of eggs have not yet erupted

44
00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:44.500
There's a lot going on there.

45
00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:45.500
There are three taboos for ministers

46
00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:46.800
Three taboos

47
00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.300
It will definitely delay the yellow disaster in Guanzhong

48
00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:51.566
The first taboo is to catch

49
00:01:51.566 --> 00:01:53.800
How to catch

50
00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:55.366
The court can issue decrees

51
00:01:55.366 --> 00:01:57.566
The people hunted locusts in the fields

52
00:01:57.566 --> 00:01:58.700
Caught locusts

53
00:01:58.733 --> 00:02:00.933
Grain can be exchanged for a certain proportion

54
00:02:00.933 --> 00:02:02.066
quit

55
00:02:02.266 --> 00:02:04.500
The common people in the class went out after hearing the wind

56
00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.766
Some people and Gundam people have any tricks

57
00:02:07.066 --> 00:02:09.766
I didn't expect it to be ridiculous

58
00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.400
How can this plan be made?

59
00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.266
I know this field is crazy

60
00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.266
Can't catch

61
00:02:15.266 --> 00:02:16.900
Even if the court is captured

62
00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.700
How do you compare the yellow worm with the grain?

63
00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.866
The contrast is low, the cabbage doesn't move at all

64
00:02:20.866 --> 00:02:23.400
The comparison is high, the court can't spend much food

65
00:02:23.533 --> 00:02:25.633
What's the use of this yellow bug?

66
00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.500
Your Majesty, the swallow has not yet seen the imperial city

67
00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.433
In a moment, he said a generous policy

68
00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:32.800
Your Majesty, forgive me.

69
00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.633
After the minister returns to the government, he will definitely be strictly disciplined

70
00:02:36.466 --> 00:02:39.700
It doesn't matter if the yellow disaster is difficult to solve since ancient times

71
00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.400
However, lamb, your strategy is indeed poisonous

72
00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.466
Grain for locusts

73
00:02:45.466 --> 00:02:48.366
These locusts, it's useless.

74
00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.166
Your Majesty, who says locusts are useless?
