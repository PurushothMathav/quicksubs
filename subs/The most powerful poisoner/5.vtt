00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:03.300
I heard that someone picked up my royal treasure

2
00:00:03.333 --> 00:00:04.800
Yes, Your Majesty

3
00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.200
Everyone is guaranteed

4
00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:09.833
I heard that it is the lamb, the son of Lord Gao Feng

5
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.866
What son of high pressure lamb

6
00:00:15.866 --> 00:00:17.566
He is the son of Soul Suffering

7
00:00:17.566 --> 00:00:18.566
Scrap him

8
00:00:18.566 --> 00:00:20.700
This is complete nonsense.

9
00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:25.066
We and our daughter-in-law made the court our home

10
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.000
When this happens

11
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.500
Your Majesty, you know everything

12
00:00:28.566 --> 00:00:30.166
This lamb is my ex

13
00:00:30.166 --> 00:00:32.000
The famous mud can't hold up the wall

14
00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:33.133
Think about Chapter 3

15
00:00:33.133 --> 00:00:35.666
I have heard of the two songs Never Flower and Stone

16
00:00:35.666 --> 00:00:37.566
Poems ridiculed by the people of big money

17
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.833
These are the hands of the Lamb.

18
00:00:41.466 --> 00:00:44.100
As big as reed flowers and stones

19
00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:45.833
I did hear

20
00:00:45.933 --> 00:00:48.000
This person really made the royal list

21
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.500
Yes, Your Majesty

22
00:00:49.566 --> 00:00:51.400
As far as I know

23
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.500
This lamb is evil

24
00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:54.533
For non-slaughter

25
00:00:54.533 --> 00:00:55.700
Relying on his identity

26
00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:58.000
But there is nothing he dares not do

27
00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.333
This time the royal list

28
00:00:59.333 --> 00:01:02.866
I'm afraid I just think the rise is interesting

29
00:01:03.166 --> 00:01:06.033
The bold royal list is no child's play

30
00:01:06.333 --> 00:01:09.100
Your Majesty, Gao Shilang and his son are seeking scriptures outside

31
00:01:09.133 --> 00:01:09.933
announce

32
00:01:10.533 --> 00:01:13.033
Xuankao Shiro Sword

33
00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.633
See your majesty

34
00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:35.900
Grass people lamb

35
00:01:36.133 --> 00:01:37.366
Meet your majesty

36
00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.233
You took over my royal list

37
00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:40.700
Your Majesty forgives his sins

38
00:01:40.866 --> 00:01:41.766
Nie Zi Wu Dao

39
00:01:41.766 --> 00:01:44.300
This time, I brought Nie Zi here

40
00:01:44.333 --> 00:01:45.866
It's to keep Nie Zi from doing it

41
00:01:46.366 --> 00:01:49.433
The grass-roots people are the talents that His Majesty wants to govern the country

42
00:01:49.966 --> 00:01:50.733
leaf

43
00:01:50.733 --> 00:01:54.366
Your me is trying to force my Gao Jiang to a dead end

44
00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.566
So brave

45
00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.166
Get up first

46
00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.033
I can say ugly things ahead

47
00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.433
The King List is a big deal

48
00:02:05.466 --> 00:02:07.800
If you can't answer my question

49
00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:10.833
I want to compare my sins to yours

50
00:02:11.166 --> 00:02:13.266
If the grass-roots cannot share His Majesty's worries

51
00:02:13.333 --> 00:02:15.100
This punishment is also a gift

52
00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.233
It's weird that I'm holding a lamb and talking extraordinary

53
00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.500
But not like the stubborn enemy of his people

54
00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.033
Could it be that there is something wrong with this?

55
00:02:27.533 --> 00:02:30.100
Let me try it out first

56
00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:35.066
Since you said you are the pillar talent I am looking for

57
00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.400
Then let me ask you a question

58
00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.166
You have now killed the entire family of your enemies

59
00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:42.900
Looking at the corpses all over the ground

60
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.866
When the heart is happy

61
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.600
Found another child in the house

62
00:02:48.766 --> 00:02:50.633
What should you do?
