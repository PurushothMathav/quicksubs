00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:03.266
Adults talk about dried cakes without clothes

2
00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:05.266
Open up at the bottom

3
00:00:10.266 --> 00:00:12.000
Tall, this Yang is really Gao Min

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:12.800
subordinates admire

5
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:13.833
only

6
00:00:14.333 --> 00:00:16.633
This foreign beam business is not afraid to let the beam go in vain

7
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:17.966
How do you say it?

8
00:00:18.133 --> 00:00:18.933
Humph

9
00:00:19.966 --> 00:00:21.800
That's human nature.

10
00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.466
Can't suppress it at all

11
00:00:23.466 --> 00:00:24.766
Linjiang City these 7 days

12
00:00:24.766 --> 00:00:26.533
A lot of people have poured into the field to heal

13
00:00:26.533 --> 00:00:28.900
There's a lot of people out there.

14
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.966
Ideas can't be the same

15
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.200
Everyone's dilemma is different

16
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.566
The choice is big or small

17
00:00:35.733 --> 00:00:38.566
The four handmade pots of Liangchang in Linjiang City

18
00:00:38.666 --> 00:00:40.466
Basically last year's pot grain

19
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.500
It's just a big disaster this year

20
00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.566
Fifty to seventy in the market

21
00:00:46.566 --> 00:00:47.666
Take the opportunity to stock up on grain

22
00:00:47.666 --> 00:00:49.166
Their cost is low enough

23
00:00:49.166 --> 00:00:50.200
Naturally not good

24
00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.300
But these foreign grain merchants are different

25
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.866
This year, Guangliang County is not feeling well as a whole

26
00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.400
Overall food prices have been rising

27
00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:59.133
Some of them

28
00:00:59.133 --> 00:01:01.366
It's all broke and wants to make a lot of money

29
00:01:01.366 --> 00:01:03.466
Some people charge a high price

30
00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.500
Do not hesitate to travel dozens of miles

31
00:01:05.866 --> 00:01:07.100
Want to make a difference?

32
00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.200
And the cost of these dozens of miles

33
00:01:09.666 --> 00:01:11.833
It's a terrifying number.

34
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.033
Not to mention that some people have spare money to buy food

35
00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.600
Some people go bankrupt to buy food

36
00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.766
So hard to tell

37
00:01:20.933 --> 00:01:22.400
Their panic selling

38
00:01:22.733 --> 00:01:24.300
Is the inevitable end

39
00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.100
Cai Cheng, even if none of them throw their hands away

40
00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.233
That's how I suffer

41
00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:33.100
Take my head to apologize to Her Majesty the Queen

42
00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:34.733
The head fell off

43
00:01:34.733 --> 00:01:36.066
It's just a scar the size of a bowl.

44
00:01:36.066 --> 00:01:37.066
What is this?

45
00:01:37.066 --> 00:01:37.566
OK

46
00:01:37.566 --> 00:01:41.333
The mentality of the adult Tarzan falling in front of him without changing his face

47
00:01:41.333 --> 00:01:43.900
The lower official is matched with hey

48
00:01:46.766 --> 00:01:47.566
Really?

49
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.600
Why do tall adults show off elegant treasures every day?

50
00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.966
The charm of the home when the experience is transparent

51
00:01:52.966 --> 00:01:53.866
carry-on treasure

52
00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:55.600
Right there.

53
00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.166
Increases your utilization

54
00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.066
Aren't you afraid that you will be lucky?

55
00:02:01.733 --> 00:02:02.700
More than that

56
00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.500
The eldest son also ordered the servants to protect him closely

57
00:02:06.133 --> 00:02:08.233
Haha oops

58
00:02:08.733 --> 00:02:10.600
Uh, Linjiang City has been decided

59
00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:11.466
Don't look anymore

60
00:02:11.466 --> 00:02:14.600
Just wait for the good family to plummet

61
00:02:19.066 --> 00:02:22.700
The price of grain in Yingjiang City is as low as 93 mosquitoes per barrel

62
00:02:22.866 --> 00:02:25.866
Then send someone to sweep the lower palace gate

63
00:02:26.733 --> 00:02:29.400
County Yannei granary onion fungus

64
00:02:29.666 --> 00:02:33.633
Another 15 acres of land, only 90 mosquitoes per barrel

65
00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:37.900
Hahahaha

66
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.400
Old Yu is not good

67
00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.300
Now grain prices in Linjiang City have fallen

68
00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:43.666
To the end of 93

69
00:02:43.666 --> 00:02:44.633
How is that possible?

70
00:02:44.666 --> 00:02:46.100
I didn't sell it.

71
00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.066
And it costs hundreds of thousands of taels to sweep the goods.

72
00:02:48.066 --> 00:02:50.666
How could the price of grain in Linjiang City drop so much?

73
00:02:51.066 --> 00:02:52.366
Don't you dare talk nonsense again

74
00:02:52.366 --> 00:02:55.466
The old man will definitely beat you to death

75
00:02:55.533 --> 00:02:57.300
Is it Liangshan from other places?

76
00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:59.066
There are many foreign Liangshan today

77
00:02:59.066 --> 00:03:01.033
They growl out of order.

78
00:03:01.133 --> 00:03:02.966
According to the speed of this decline

79
00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:07.133
I'm afraid it will soon be enough for Jiusheng Yiduo.

80
00:03:07.133 --> 00:03:09.900
Fart me Lingjiang City Temple is great

81
00:03:09.933 --> 00:03:12.033
Where did so many out-of-town healing come from?
