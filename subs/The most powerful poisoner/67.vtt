00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:01.233
evil animal

2
00:00:02.966 --> 00:00:04.066
Father

3
00:00:04.166 --> 00:00:06.000
Grandpa you

4
00:00:06.533 --> 00:00:08.633
Hey you today

5
00:00:09.066 --> 00:00:10.666
Shouldn't you be greedy for all your efforts?

6
00:00:10.666 --> 00:00:14.200
The ambition of today's empress is clear to me

7
00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.700
So you can't rush it.

8
00:00:16.966 --> 00:00:19.000
Modesty moves the whole body

9
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
There will be disaster

10
00:00:21.066 --> 00:00:22.066
Although know

11
00:00:22.166 --> 00:00:24.466
But risk comes with savings

12
00:00:24.666 --> 00:00:25.900
If this progress is successful

13
00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:26.933
Move to Longjing King

14
00:00:26.933 --> 00:00:28.066
That means the world can wait

15
00:00:28.566 --> 00:00:30.300
Now that you have a way

16
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.400
The old man is waiting to see your methods

17
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.566
But today I came here to say something to you

18
00:00:37.566 --> 00:00:39.866
Call the rabbit dead dog to cook

19
00:00:40.066 --> 00:00:42.600
Today's greedy advice Chang Wang

20
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.866
But there are a lot of people waiting to see the joke

21
00:00:44.866 --> 00:00:47.300
Today, if your plan has been successful

22
00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:48.600
work height array weight

23
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:49.766
If not

24
00:00:49.766 --> 00:00:51.366
Your brother will also protect you

25
00:00:51.366 --> 00:00:53.600
Because he needs your talent

26
00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.066
When one day your brother doesn't need you anymore

27
00:00:56.066 --> 00:00:59.133
That's when my big money really became powerful

28
00:00:59.133 --> 00:01:00.466
And this greed

29
00:01:00.533 --> 00:01:03.666
It will become your way of death

30
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:05.766
Did grandpa ever think about it?

31
00:01:05.766 --> 00:01:08.200
If your grandson is not greedy or lustful

32
00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.666
A person who has no weakness and is poisonous to his own animals

33
00:01:10.666 --> 00:01:12.466
How could the empress give up?

34
00:01:12.466 --> 00:01:14.200
How can you delegate power?

35
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.366
This is corrupt and lecherous

36
00:01:16.666 --> 00:01:18.300
It's all released by you

37
00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.466
Also, the tea box.

38
00:01:20.466 --> 00:01:22.900
It's also you who took the initiative to let the empress know

39
00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:24.133
Hello, used by him

40
00:01:24.133 --> 00:01:27.666
Hey, this corruption and lust is indeed the nature of my grandson

41
00:01:27.666 --> 00:01:30.066
But it's not worth it for the empress to see

42
00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:31.100
Grandpa don't worry

43
00:01:31.266 --> 00:01:32.466
Grandchildren are cautious by nature

44
00:01:32.466 --> 00:01:34.333
Before I'm sure

45
00:01:34.333 --> 00:01:37.633
Grandchildren will be half wrong and half right

46
00:01:38.133 --> 00:01:40.766
Do you have a way to get the best of both worlds?

47
00:01:41.733 --> 00:01:44.766
The second way of 12 has the best of both worlds

48
00:01:44.766 --> 00:01:46.133
Just a little bold

49
00:01:46.133 --> 00:01:48.066
Afraid of scaring grandpa, you say

50
00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:50.200
That is to take the empress

51
00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:51.100
Conquer the Empress

52
00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:52.733
As long as the empress returns to her heart

53
00:01:52.733 --> 00:01:55.166
Then you don't have to worry about the rabbit and the dog dying.

54
00:01:55.166 --> 00:01:57.200
Even the emperor of Great Qin

55
00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.866
The future may not be able to be surnamed Gao

56
00:02:00.166 --> 00:02:01.666
Sun Er has a third way

57
00:02:01.666 --> 00:02:02.900
It's not just audacious.

58
00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:03.966
And it works.

59
00:02:03.966 --> 00:02:04.866
To tell the truth, grandpa

60
00:02:04.866 --> 00:02:06.333
Sun Er as a strategist

61
00:02:06.333 --> 00:02:08.400
In terms of demagogy

62
00:02:08.466 --> 00:02:09.300
Night cat game

63
00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.266
Damn, don't you know that partitions have ears?

64
00:02:12.266 --> 00:02:14.000
Don't you dare talk nonsense again

65
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.033
Do you believe I'll break your legs?

66
00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:17.800
Okay, today's training sister

67
00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.533
Now that you know, your father and I will leave first

68
00:02:20.533 --> 00:02:22.666
You should be ashamed of that.
