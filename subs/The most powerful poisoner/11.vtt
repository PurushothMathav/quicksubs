00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.400
backcountry

2
00:00:01.466 --> 00:00:02.700
People are lazy

3
00:00:02.733 --> 00:00:05.633
The local magistrate must not be able to catch oil and water

4
00:00:05.666 --> 00:00:07.633
There is a high probability that he will be a corrupt official

5
00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:09.100
Before the game

6
00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:11.166
It can be bribed with a lot of money

7
00:00:11.333 --> 00:00:12.866
If there is limited assistance

8
00:00:12.866 --> 00:00:15.466
This game gets twice the result with half the effort

9
00:00:15.666 --> 00:00:17.566
Yezi Hugh is talking nonsense

10
00:00:18.566 --> 00:00:21.533
Your Majesty Yezi said the wrong thing without cover

11
00:00:21.533 --> 00:00:23.700
Your Majesty, forgive me.

12
00:00:24.266 --> 00:00:26.300
Don't say it's hypothetical

13
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.400
Even in the backcountry of Daqian

14
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:30.400
It has been so far

15
00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.300
Is this corrupt official still few?

16
00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.166
Lamb, continue to speak

17
00:00:35.333 --> 00:00:36.800
After bribing the county magistrate

18
00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.066
After bribing the county magistrate

19
00:00:50.766 --> 00:00:52.800
You wait to see Min Huang Lightning

20
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:53.833
Big power

21
00:00:53.866 --> 00:00:55.366
So plug in the private one.

22
00:00:56.066 --> 00:00:57.766
Forbidden to dig for gold

23
00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.666
Still violates the law of power

24
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:00.966
What crime

25
00:01:04.166 --> 00:01:05.733
Oops, not us.

26
00:01:05.733 --> 00:01:07.266
We didn't find any gold at all.

27
00:01:07.266 --> 00:01:08.866
And this is a great injustice

28
00:01:08.866 --> 00:01:11.966
Not you who is that

29
00:01:11.966 --> 00:01:14.666
It's been spread in the gold mines

30
00:01:14.666 --> 00:01:16.700
Do you think this official is deaf?

31
00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:17.966
Kill the gold immediately

32
00:01:17.966 --> 00:01:20.166
Otherwise kill without mercy

33
00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.266
Sir, I know who it is

34
00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:25.733
It's the gold he dug

35
00:01:25.733 --> 00:01:26.800
He deserved to die.

36
00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.200
It has nothing to do with us.

37
00:01:28.266 --> 00:01:30.266
What nonsense are you talking about?

38
00:01:30.466 --> 00:01:32.800
You bastard, you are talking nonsense

39
00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:44.033
People are jealous

40
00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.000
Most people can't see how others are doing

41
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.866
Must report each other

42
00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:49.933
Free without a penny

43
00:01:49.933 --> 00:01:51.200
Wait for the people to open up the famine

44
00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.233
The silver dug up has to be returned

45
00:01:54.533 --> 00:01:57.833
This plan is so toxic

46
00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.200
first bribe restraining order

47
00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.933
Reuse human evil

48
00:02:01.933 --> 00:02:04.966
Get back the gold you buried before

49
00:02:04.966 --> 00:02:07.966
Although the Dai people have some of this plan

50
00:02:07.966 --> 00:02:10.133
But it does with minimal labor costs

51
00:02:10.133 --> 00:02:12.200
Did the most efficient land reclamation

52
00:02:13.066 --> 00:02:13.900
world

53
00:02:20.066 --> 00:02:21.266
It's my son

54
00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.966
Huilu County Magistrate, this is bound to cost a lot

55
00:02:23.966 --> 00:02:26.666
The most common people can do is to return the gold

56
00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:28.366
But with my life

57
00:02:28.366 --> 00:02:30.066
Is it really worth it?

58
00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.000
Cui Zhuangyuan

59
00:02:31.333 --> 00:02:34.600
Are there still few things about the combination of officials and businesspeople in this world?

60
00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.633
Who's going to pay a heavy bribe as soon as they go up?

61
00:02:38.133 --> 00:02:40.000
corrupt official

62
00:02:40.366 --> 00:02:42.600
Go for a walk in the world and you will know

63
00:02:42.866 --> 00:02:47.833
And it goes beyond that.

64
00:02:47.966 --> 00:02:52.166
If I say this gold is gold on the outside

65
00:02:52.533 --> 00:02:54.833
Is there copper in it?
