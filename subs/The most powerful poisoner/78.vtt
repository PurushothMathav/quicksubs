Chen Zhulong greets His Majesty

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.500
Thank you, Your Majesty

3
00:00:09.366 --> 00:00:12.566
Prince Rong, I have called you here this time

4
00:00:12.566 --> 00:00:16.400
I want you and Shigerang Gao to smile and grudge

5
00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.300
You are both big money pillars

6
00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:20.833
Minister of the Bone

7
00:00:21.166 --> 00:00:22.666
No complaints

8
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.366
Wan'er Dao Jiu is

9
00:00:44.933 --> 00:00:47.166
Thank you, Your Majesty

10
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.566
I don't dare to leave this woman

11
00:00:52.566 --> 00:00:55.000
I didn't do anything after I entered the palace

12
00:00:55.066 --> 00:00:56.466
But why not

13
00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.966
Thank you for the wine

14
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:08.766
Why are you so dizzy?

15
00:01:13.266 --> 00:01:14.433
Daring Zhou Long

16
00:01:14.766 --> 00:01:16.066
I treat you like this

17
00:01:16.066 --> 00:01:19.400
How dare you fight a voodoo doll in the mansion

18
00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.066
deserve death

19
00:01:21.066 --> 00:01:22.466
Why is the black dragon there?

20
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.900
Your Majesty, you did it on purpose

21
00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:33.300
I want Tu Jiang to be busy

22
00:01:33.466 --> 00:01:35.666
Zhou Long committed a heinous crime

23
00:01:36.133 --> 00:01:39.900
Get me dozens of stinky fish and rotten shrimp

24
00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.100
Thank you for shooting down this king dog sheep

25
00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.566
You have dozens of damn rich people

26
00:01:44.566 --> 00:01:46.100
Why did this king poison the dragon?

27
00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:47.633
The King of Qing sees people accurately

28
00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.300
That's right, it's the medicine that the lower official gave you

29
00:01:52.933 --> 00:01:54.400
Just dozens of rich

30
00:01:54.666 --> 00:01:56.566
Hmph, I want to win the worship list

31
00:01:56.733 --> 00:01:58.900
It's just a dream to see you

32
00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:00.800
Otherwise, don't blame the kings for their injustice.

33
00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.066
The waiting list kills them all

34
00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.600
Zhou Qianwen has become you, talk back to me

35
00:02:07.166 --> 00:02:07.966
Ah!

36
00:02:08.333 --> 00:02:09.400
Uh-huh.

37
00:02:10.066 --> 00:02:12.200
Uh-huh.

38
00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:14.900
Farewell

39
00:02:15.866 --> 00:02:17.100
Ah!

40
00:02:20.933 --> 00:02:22.000
Oh, dear.

41
00:02:26.766 --> 00:02:27.866
Prince Gong

42
00:02:28.533 --> 00:02:33.100
You lose, there will be no Prince Rong's mansion after today
