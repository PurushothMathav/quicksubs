1
00:00:00.466 --> 00:00:03.766
Lord Du, go get a name and bury Cheng Xian

2
00:00:10.166 --> 00:00:12.233
Of course you can close the net.

3
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.233
Insure amount immediately

4
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:21.966
You will except for the granary.

5
00:00:21.966 --> 00:00:23.200
full opening loan

6
00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.166
Got this one for 10 billion yuan

7
00:00:27.966 --> 00:00:29.100
streets and alleys

8
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:31.700
Sir

9
00:00:32.966 --> 00:00:35.300
Immediately send troops to take over Mingjiang Chengma

10
00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:36.266
All regulations

11
00:00:36.366 --> 00:00:37.533
No appearance at all

12
00:00:37.533 --> 00:00:38.966
Violator beheaded

13
00:00:39.066 --> 00:00:42.000
The various city sects of Mingjiang City were heavily punished

14
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:42.800
all

15
00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:44.300
not allowed to appear

16
00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:46.666
Obey the will of the lord

17
00:00:46.666 --> 00:00:49.566
The lord and the officer are still a little worried

18
00:00:49.566 --> 00:00:51.700
As my lord said before

19
00:00:51.766 --> 00:00:53.500
If you open the warehouse to put grain

20
00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.200
I am afraid that the grain warehouse will have enough food

21
00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.200
Grain merchants in the city suffered hard for a few days

22
00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:02.466
I am afraid that once the grain warehouse is sold out

23
00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.666
What should I do then?

24
00:01:06.533 --> 00:01:07.333
Lord Du

25
00:01:07.366 --> 00:01:11.300
Have you forgotten that there is still a batch of town grains outside the city?

26
00:01:11.366 --> 00:01:12.133
Zhao Qianhan

27
00:01:12.133 --> 00:01:14.900
The four families of Lin will be entrenched in Lin for a hundred years

28
00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:16.200
power setback

29
00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:17.566
Is afraid

30
00:01:18.133 --> 00:01:20.000
Do you know that the granary needs food?

31
00:01:20.066 --> 00:01:21.166
They know.

32
00:01:21.166 --> 00:01:22.366
They can understand

33
00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:23.700
But those out-of-town grains

34
00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.333
Shang and local small farmers in Linjiang City

35
00:01:26.333 --> 00:01:27.400
They can wait

36
00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.400
Sell first, sell later, bankruptcy will not sell

37
00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.433
Then lose a row of one cent of grain

38
00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.566
Success or failure, Lord Du

39
00:01:35.566 --> 00:01:36.900
If it were you

40
00:01:36.933 --> 00:01:38.100
How do you choose

41
00:01:38.333 --> 00:01:39.133
Humph

42
00:01:40.066 --> 00:01:41.266
Conspiracy can block

43
00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:42.766
wool

44
00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:47.200
The officer will report it now

45
00:01:47.666 --> 00:01:48.566
Hey wait

46
00:01:49.333 --> 00:01:51.433
What other orders does the lord have?

47
00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:53.666
Not much grain in the granary

48
00:01:53.666 --> 00:01:55.033
Don't sell too fast.

49
00:01:55.333 --> 00:01:57.600
Let people queue up to buy

50
00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.300
It also needs to be registered one by one.

51
00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.500
When the news is released to the outside world, it is said that His Majesty has ordered

52
00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.266
Zhengcai has 100,000 and the grain has been shipped to Linjiang City

53
00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:08.566
this official

54
00:02:08.566 --> 00:02:11.866
What I hate the most is the healing of those who have made a fortune in the country

55
00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:13.233
This time

56
00:02:13.366 --> 00:02:16.400
This official will let those who have made a fortune in the country heal

57
00:02:16.966 --> 00:02:18.433
All bankrupt

58
00:02:19.166 --> 00:02:21.766
The limit order may be 10 days.

59
00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.300
Maybe half a month.

60
00:02:24.766 --> 00:02:26.233
It all depends on my mood

61
00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.566
Adults are very unique

62
00:02:28.566 --> 00:02:30.766
A businessperson meets an adult

63
00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.600
After ten lifetimes of blood noodles

64
00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:37.033
This time, it may have fallen sharply twice in Linjiang City

65
00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:44.400
This kind of grapevine

66
00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:45.800
The name of the foreign beam club

67
00:02:46.466 --> 00:02:48.766
Lord Shangguan, you missed it

68
00:02:50.933 --> 00:02:53.533
You still don't understand human nature in the first half

69
00:02:53.533 --> 00:02:55.000
Grain merchants from out of town

70
00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.366
Do not hesitate to sell a house across dozens of miles

71
00:02:57.366 --> 00:03:00.566
The loss on the road is more than 1/10.

72
00:03:00.566 --> 00:03:04.266
Plus the cook's swaying daily wages

73
00:03:04.266 --> 00:03:06.133
Make money every time you go

74
00:03:06.133 --> 00:03:07.933
Their costs are being deducted.

75
00:03:07.933 --> 00:03:09.966
Even if they don't sell it hard

76
00:03:09.966 --> 00:03:12.666
Then it's another batch of high costs.

77
00:03:12.666 --> 00:03:14.500
Now for them

78
00:03:14.733 --> 00:03:16.700
A little bit of wind blows the grass roots

79
00:03:16.866 --> 00:03:18.166
That's the wind

80
00:03:18.166 --> 00:03:20.300
See you soon for peace

81
00:03:20.866 --> 00:03:24.833
The most powerful thing in this game is to step on the sales road

82
00:03:24.966 --> 00:03:28.833
The one who shoots first can still make money and then shoots

83
00:03:30.133 --> 00:03:30.933
Humph

84
00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:32.400
eldest son

85
00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.933
You probably won't sell your slaves one day

86
00:03:34.933 --> 00:03:37.866
The servant will count the money for you, hahaha.

87
00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.166
Does this son look like that kind of person?

88
00:03:43.066 --> 00:03:46.300
Then why don't you read the money well for this young master?

89
00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:47.633
If you don't squeeze it well

90
00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:48.700
Then you have to think
