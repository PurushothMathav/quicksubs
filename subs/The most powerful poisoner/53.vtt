00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.566
In my previous life, this roasted yellow worm cost a few dollars a bunch.

2
00:00:03.666 --> 00:00:06.666
This price is almost the same as beef and mutton.

3
00:00:06.666 --> 00:00:08.200
I love it

4
00:00:08.533 --> 00:00:11.700
Mr. Gao, do you know that what you say is relevant?

5
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.233
Guanzhong Millions of Surnames

6
00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:15.166
If something goes wrong

7
00:00:15.166 --> 00:00:16.166
Not just you

8
00:00:16.166 --> 00:00:19.766
Even if it's your entire Dingguo Kung Fu, you can't afford it

9
00:00:19.766 --> 00:00:22.500
There are some things that Lord Gao still needs to be careful about

10
00:00:22.933 --> 00:00:25.200
This could be what Nie Zi said

11
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.366
And they can read.

12
00:00:28.866 --> 00:00:30.700
What the hell

13
00:00:31.266 --> 00:00:32.666
That's it.

14
00:00:34.333 --> 00:00:35.066
Your Majesty

15
00:00:35.066 --> 00:00:39.333
The government of Chending is willing to use the house title deed as proof

16
00:00:39.333 --> 00:00:40.900
Get some emperor bugs at a low price

17
00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:42.600
Relieve pressure on the treasury

18
00:00:42.766 --> 00:00:47.066
Er Chen is also willing to give his life experience to the royal family

19
00:00:47.566 --> 00:00:49.600
The words of the rebellious son

20
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.366
High love is true

21
00:00:52.366 --> 00:00:53.200
Your Majesty

22
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.700
The reverse son finally became a late bloomer

23
00:00:56.733 --> 00:00:58.900
The Shame of Being a Father's Self-Destruction

24
00:00:59.266 --> 00:01:00.966
If the imperial city is really poisonous

25
00:01:00.966 --> 00:01:04.200
Then the silver will serve the country.

26
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:06.666
I guess His Majesty will not watch

27
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.966
Dingguo Kung Fu is full of starvation

28
00:01:09.166 --> 00:01:12.700
I will not let my subjects bear the burden

29
00:01:12.733 --> 00:01:15.466
Since all Aiqing have no way

30
00:01:15.466 --> 00:01:17.566
Then come in the way of the lamb

31
00:01:17.566 --> 00:01:20.900
Some things can only be known if you try them.

32
00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:22.166
As for losses

33
00:01:22.733 --> 00:01:24.233
I came out of my underwear

34
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.100
From your brother's panties

35
00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.933
Is it that underwear?

36
00:01:30.933 --> 00:01:32.400
Girl's private money

37
00:01:32.666 --> 00:01:34.033
You scared me!

38
00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:38.066
What you recorded in this ancient book during the Song Dynasty is true

39
00:01:38.066 --> 00:01:41.166
That's just for a small number of non-toxic feuds

40
00:01:41.166 --> 00:01:43.466
But most of the eggs in this level are from hell

41
00:01:43.466 --> 00:01:44.966
As the Lamb said

42
00:01:44.966 --> 00:01:47.200
You are a social and toxic feud

43
00:01:47.266 --> 00:01:48.600
What's the solution to this?

44
00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.000
The minister has a third way

45
00:01:51.066 --> 00:01:52.233
Biological control

46
00:01:52.266 --> 00:01:54.000
Natural enemies resist each other

47
00:01:54.366 --> 00:01:56.500
Roast sheep natural enemies

48
00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:57.933
This method has never been heard of

49
00:01:57.933 --> 00:01:59.400
What do you mean?

50
00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.566
All things in this world coexist and resist each other

51
00:02:01.566 --> 00:02:02.800
Not just locusts

52
00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:04.666
All other animals have natural enemies

53
00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:06.433
For example, rats are afraid of cats

54
00:02:06.533 --> 00:02:07.700
Rabbits are afraid of mice

55
00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.266
Insects are afraid of frogs

56
00:02:09.266 --> 00:02:11.933
A sudden outbreak of something in an area

57
00:02:11.933 --> 00:02:13.733
Must be fewer natural enemies

58
00:02:13.733 --> 00:02:15.433
Although this locust is strange

59
00:02:15.466 --> 00:02:17.066
But you can't escape this pattern.

60
00:02:17.066 --> 00:02:20.166
Biological control is based on this idea

61
00:02:20.166 --> 00:02:22.666
This idea is there

62
00:02:22.666 --> 00:02:26.066
Some meaning may really solve the danger in the customs

63
00:02:26.266 --> 00:02:29.600
Elegant, what is biological control?

64
00:02:30.066 --> 00:02:31.233
natural enemy reduction

65
00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:32.200
The environment is suitable

66
00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.333
This is a necessary condition for a yellow disaster to break out

67
00:02:34.333 --> 00:02:36.733
We can't change the drought.

68
00:02:36.733 --> 00:02:37.566
But

69
00:02:37.566 --> 00:02:40.700
We can increase the wild predators of locusts

70
00:02:42.266 --> 00:02:44.766
Chen's plan is to be in the Chang'an area

71
00:02:44.766 --> 00:02:47.700
Gather 50,000 chickens and ducks in one day

72
00:02:47.733 --> 00:02:49.566
Form a chicken-duck coalition

73
00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.033
March on Guanzhong

74
00:02:51.766 --> 00:02:53.066
This chicken?

75
00:02:53.066 --> 00:02:56.133
They can feed on hundreds of locusts a day

76
00:02:56.133 --> 00:02:57.400
This 50,000

77
00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.133
That's 50 million locusts a day.

78
00:03:00.133 --> 00:03:01.400
Even if you fold it in half

79
00:03:01.466 --> 00:03:04.166
Millions could be wiped out that day

80
00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.433
Well at the moment

81
00:03:06.466 --> 00:03:08.200
The Guanzhong locusts have not yet broken out

82
00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:09.200
Mostly eggs

83
00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:10.400
Within a few days

84
00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.466
It can be greatly reduced

85
00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.866
Even if the yellow disaster does break out in the future

86
00:03:14.866 --> 00:03:17.066
That's reduced by hundreds of millions.

87
00:03:17.066 --> 00:03:18.566
Billions of them.

88
00:03:18.566 --> 00:03:20.833
The harm has been greatly reduced.

89
00:03:21.133 --> 00:03:26.200
This law minister would like to call him biological control

90
00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:29.000
OK
