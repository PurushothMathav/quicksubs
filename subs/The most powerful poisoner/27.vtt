00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:02.200
Your Majesty, these last seven days

2
00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:04.133
Grain prices in Linjiang City have been skyrocketing

3
00:00:04.133 --> 00:00:06.466
And that was two days ago.

4
00:00:06.466 --> 00:00:09.800
The grain price in Linyang City is probably even higher now.

5
00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:11.833
What's with the tweezers?

6
00:00:12.166 --> 00:00:13.600
Really want to hurt me Gao Jiang

7
00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:15.433
The whole door cannot be cut

8
00:00:16.333 --> 00:00:17.866
I stand brand Zhongyi

9
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.200
This is what the lamb gave me

10
00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:21.433
And not only that.

11
00:00:21.466 --> 00:00:23.933
Gao Yushi also ordered the renovation of the county cliff

12
00:00:23.933 --> 00:00:26.800
Host a grand event on the Qingshui River

13
00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:27.900
Dragon boat race

14
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.800
Su Xieling was heartbroken

15
00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.900
Ordered 800 miles to play chess in court

16
00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:33.366
Your Majesty hum

17
00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:36.366
The absurd old man has been collecting for 30 years

18
00:00:36.366 --> 00:00:38.533
I've never seen anything so ridiculous

19
00:00:38.533 --> 00:00:39.633
So hard

20
00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:41.400
How can the old man tolerate him

21
00:00:41.466 --> 00:00:44.600
I implore Your Majesty to severely punish the grandson of Duke Ding

22
00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:45.866
Quell public anger

23
00:00:46.366 --> 00:00:47.633
Mo Jiao Buddha seal

24
00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.166
The minister loses righteousness, the minister handles the seat Ruyi

25
00:00:52.866 --> 00:00:55.700
It's over, my Gao family is over

26
00:00:57.933 --> 00:00:59.633
Lord Ding

27
00:01:04.066 --> 00:01:07.433
Old minister Gao Tianlong meets His Majesty

28
00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.800
Uncle Kim, pick it up quickly

29
00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.100
Your Majesty, I have only one thing to do today

30
00:01:16.333 --> 00:01:18.000
Soaring food prices

31
00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:19.900
Restore the tiger teeth

32
00:01:19.933 --> 00:01:22.966
This is the news from Linjiang Mansion two days ago

33
00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.900
Why should anyone panic?

34
00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.900
In two days, Linjiang Mansion was in chaos

35
00:01:30.466 --> 00:01:32.433
Wait two more days.

36
00:01:33.666 --> 00:01:35.200
Would you?

37
00:01:50.166 --> 00:01:52.366
Hey, Lord Du

38
00:01:52.533 --> 00:01:55.566
You've been back and forth ten times this morning

39
00:01:55.566 --> 00:01:58.266
It's almost shaking this young master

40
00:01:59.133 --> 00:02:01.566
You can sit still with the anger outside

41
00:02:01.566 --> 00:02:03.433
I can't sit still

42
00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:05.666
Psychological quality like yours

43
00:02:05.766 --> 00:02:08.066
It's really rare

44
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.966
Okay, uncle liu

45
00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.433
Xu Xu, you will become immortal

46
00:02:13.466 --> 00:02:16.066
If you forget to kill
