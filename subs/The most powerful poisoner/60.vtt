1
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.133
Your Majesty, leaving you alone is a supreme grudge

2
00:00:07.133 --> 00:00:08.666
Did you do something disrespectful?

3
00:00:08.733 --> 00:00:09.933
Don't worry, father

4
00:00:09.933 --> 00:00:11.500
He looked the whole time.

5
00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:12.766
No disrespect

6
00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:13.700
OK

7
00:00:14.466 --> 00:00:16.800
Her Majesty is now a minister and empress

8
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.500
Those who are ministers should have a heart of awe

9
00:00:19.666 --> 00:00:21.700
The appropriate distance should be maintained

10
00:00:21.966 --> 00:00:24.000
My father came from your age

11
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.100
The allure of this majesty is clearly maintained

12
00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:30.466
But you can't have what you shouldn't have.

13
00:00:30.733 --> 00:00:32.266
Otherwise, don't say you are alone

14
00:00:32.266 --> 00:00:35.633
Even the entire empire is doomed to die

15
00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.000
Good to know

16
00:00:37.733 --> 00:00:41.233
By the way, you did a great job counterattacking this time

17
00:00:41.666 --> 00:00:43.566
My father is also very relieved

18
00:00:43.566 --> 00:00:44.366
But

19
00:00:44.866 --> 00:00:48.100
The backlog of generals and the emperor of pit kings

20
00:00:48.733 --> 00:00:50.000
The means are too hasty

21
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.866
I'm afraid it will never end.

22
00:00:52.266 --> 00:00:53.300
Father

23
00:00:53.333 --> 00:00:56.500
Do you think that Wang Zhong played and sweated repeatedly in the dynasty?

24
00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:58.833
He's the only one behind it.

25
00:00:59.366 --> 00:01:02.100
My Dingguo Kung Fu has long been immortal

26
00:01:02.866 --> 00:01:06.833
Are you saying that behind Wang Zhong is his mother, the king?

27
00:01:07.066 --> 00:01:08.633
From Haier to Wucheng pit

28
00:01:08.766 --> 00:01:11.166
The fight has already begun

29
00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.066
The ministers of the DPRK and China are all wives and children

30
00:01:14.066 --> 00:01:15.966
Take over His Majesty's Qixian Zhao

31
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.666
It's impossible for them not to know this.

32
00:01:19.166 --> 00:01:20.866
Grandpa is sitting in the virus

33
00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.266
How many want to kill grandpa?

34
00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:25.533
But starting from Linjiang City

35
00:01:25.533 --> 00:01:26.733
Negotiations for children

36
00:01:26.733 --> 00:01:29.500
Negotiations on Dingguo Kung Fu one after another

37
00:01:29.933 --> 00:01:32.033
Except for a few political histories

38
00:01:32.066 --> 00:01:34.033
The rest are all

39
00:01:34.866 --> 00:01:37.666
Why was Prince Ke Rong so blatant?

40
00:01:38.066 --> 00:01:39.266
And the answer is quite simple.

41
00:01:39.533 --> 00:01:42.600
Use Dingguo Kung Fu to force courtiers to fight

42
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.866
Threatening imperial power

43
00:01:46.566 --> 00:01:48.500
Father's disturbance

44
00:01:48.666 --> 00:01:50.233
Long retired

45
00:01:50.333 --> 00:01:51.600
The king is far from the court

46
00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.866
It's a good thing for us.

47
00:01:53.866 --> 00:01:55.800
If you still want to take this errand

48
00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:59.166
Then Prince Rong will definitely order the Heng family secretly

49
00:01:59.333 --> 00:02:01.200
But if the king goes to Guanzhong

50
00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.866
Then Prince Rong will definitely not sit idly by

51
00:02:03.966 --> 00:02:05.833
Zhao Lie will be smooth

52
00:02:06.966 --> 00:02:09.100
Does your grandfather know about this?

53
00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.100
Grandpa asked Father to give him some silver taels

54
00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:14.566
What the hell?

55
00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.000
Okay, I'll send someone to deliver it right away

56
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.900
This is about the whole ordering process

57
00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.233
You take charge

58
00:02:23.966 --> 00:02:26.300
Thank you father

59
00:02:30.533 --> 00:02:32.966
Master, are you back?

60
00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.333
This is a letter sent by Miss Song

61
00:02:35.333 --> 00:02:37.466
Please be sure to deliver it to you, sir.

62
00:02:39.966 --> 00:02:41.000
You tell him

63
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.133
At the place where we first met

64
00:02:43.133 --> 00:02:44.900
Be there or be square

65
00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.600
Young master or hey

66
00:02:47.733 --> 00:02:51.266
Why is that old slave going to run a carriage and carry a carriage?

67
00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.566
Master, aren't you going to the appointment?

68
00:02:55.566 --> 00:02:56.866
Played with his dad

69
00:02:56.866 --> 00:03:00.066
It's getting dark and I'm not going to sleep to go to the appointment.

70
00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:01.433
I have a problem with my brain

71
00:03:01.566 --> 00:03:03.633
Don't give up and feed it to the dog
