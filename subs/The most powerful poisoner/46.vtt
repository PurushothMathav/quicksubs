00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.600
Linjiang City is more than 200 miles away from Chang'an

2
00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:03.900
My son has a heart

3
00:00:04.066 --> 00:00:05.533
When did the child say

4
00:00:05.533 --> 00:00:08.666
That tea is a specialty for my father

5
00:00:08.666 --> 00:00:10.933
Nie Zi, do you still want to hide from the old man?

6
00:00:10.933 --> 00:00:13.333
Lord Shangguan has already informed the old man

7
00:00:13.333 --> 00:00:15.333
That tea is from you

8
00:00:15.333 --> 00:00:17.933
Linjiang City made a special trip to bring it back to honor the old man

9
00:00:17.933 --> 00:00:19.266
Hahahaha

10
00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:21.766
Work late

11
00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:24.400
My Money

12
00:00:25.733 --> 00:00:27.466
You wait for me.

13
00:00:28.566 --> 00:00:29.666
Hahaha

14
00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:32.500
The child wanted to surprise his father

15
00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.866
I didn't expect Mr. Shuangguan to say it first

16
00:00:34.866 --> 00:00:36.066
That tea is precious

17
00:00:36.066 --> 00:00:38.733
I also invite my father to taste it alone

18
00:00:38.733 --> 00:00:40.566
Humph filial piety to filial piety

19
00:00:40.566 --> 00:00:42.900
But one horse is one horse.

20
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:44.666
Lie down and pout your butt

21
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.400
Father, what are you trying to do, you evil son?

22
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.200
You forgot what the old man told you

23
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.800
Don't leave the middle book

24
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.200
You have to go to the house to eat and wait to die

25
00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.800
I have to teach you two a lesson today.

26
00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.566
Did father come here specially?

27
00:00:58.566 --> 00:01:00.200
Not to thank the child for his filial piety

28
00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:01.533
I'm here to smoke children

29
00:01:01.533 --> 00:01:03.500
These two do not affect

30
00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:04.666
Bring the family law

31
00:01:08.733 --> 00:01:09.966
Hi, okay, okay.

32
00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.966
It's all my fault

33
00:01:13.466 --> 00:01:16.200
Plenary session on the progress of male sons-in-law

34
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.266
creator

35
00:01:17.266 --> 00:01:19.700
You will be the pride of your mother

36
00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:23.100
The child was actually busy because of climbing heavy trees

37
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.833
Let someone urge the galaxy

38
00:01:24.966 --> 00:01:27.566
Mother, please let father kill me

39
00:01:27.566 --> 00:01:28.833
The child is not married

40
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Hahaha

41
00:01:30.533 --> 00:01:32.700
Don't do stupid things, sheep

42
00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:33.900
My mother is here today

43
00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.066
Don't worry.

44
00:01:35.333 --> 00:01:38.200
Look at what you've done to your children

45
00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:39.733
The sheep are so cowardly now

46
00:01:39.733 --> 00:01:41.966
You, the father, are to blame

47
00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:43.966
Madam this negative child

48
00:01:43.966 --> 00:01:46.133
That's not what it said at the door

49
00:01:46.133 --> 00:01:47.600
You can't be serious about that.

50
00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.400
Who is still thinking about sending you tea a hundred miles away?

51
00:01:51.566 --> 00:01:53.233
What a filial child

52
00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:55.566
You are so heartless

53
00:01:55.566 --> 00:01:57.366
To such a filial child

54
00:01:57.366 --> 00:01:59.300
What kind of bullying have you become?

55
00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:02.600
Even filial piety has to be suggested by Lord Shangguan

56
00:02:02.733 --> 00:02:04.833
If the sheep do something stupid

57
00:02:05.366 --> 00:02:06.633
I don't live anymore

58
00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:08.466
Hey ma'am

59
00:02:10.966 --> 00:02:12.700
Okay, dry tweezers.

60
00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.466
Design me, you wait for me.

61
00:02:14.466 --> 00:02:15.433
It's really not over

62
00:02:15.866 --> 00:02:17.266
madam madam
