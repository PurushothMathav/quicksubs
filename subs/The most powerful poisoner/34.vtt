1
00:00:00.466 --> 00:00:01.933
The old man has played all his life

2
00:00:01.933 --> 00:00:05.466
I didn't expect to be burned in the eyes by an eagle today

3
00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:07.466
Mr. Lin, don't sell it

4
00:00:07.466 --> 00:00:09.566
What is this high lord trying to do?

5
00:00:09.566 --> 00:00:11.233
So think about that.

6
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.100
The price rises to 1.50 million

7
00:00:14.166 --> 00:00:15.766
Except for me, who benefits

8
00:00:15.933 --> 00:00:17.566
Who else will it attract?

9
00:00:18.766 --> 00:00:21.333
This lamb lifts up the beams of the riverside city

10
00:00:21.333 --> 00:00:22.900
Xiling foreign mountains release longevity sheep

11
00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.100
This lamb came to Linjiang City

12
00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:27.966
Raise the sheep rack to 150 watts per bucket

13
00:00:27.966 --> 00:00:29.366
Far more than sending troops to the Liang family

14
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.300
It is bound to attract envious foreign businesspeople

15
00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:33.666
Crazy influx into Pingjiang City

16
00:00:33.666 --> 00:00:35.333
When the time is right

17
00:00:35.333 --> 00:00:38.066
He will order the county to press the granary and shoot the grain

18
00:00:38.066 --> 00:00:40.500
Sell at the price of 105 literary fights

19
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:41.766
It brought down food prices.

20
00:00:41.966 --> 00:00:44.733
It's a pity that I will realize this later

21
00:00:44.733 --> 00:00:47.466
The price of 105 yuan

22
00:00:47.466 --> 00:00:50.233
Fully accepted the grain from the county cliff granary

23
00:00:51.266 --> 00:00:52.700
Master Li is not good

24
00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:53.800
County Ya decoration insulation

25
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.400
Linglijiang County Ya Granary

26
00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.700
It is sold at the price of 90 characters a bucket.

27
00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:59.566
I lost another 15 yuan.

28
00:00:59.566 --> 00:01:01.800
Lord Jade really wants our lives?

29
00:01:01.933 --> 00:01:05.100
I also saw people from the yamen wearing plain clothes

30
00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.200
I bought a lot of food at the price of 93 mosquitoes

31
00:01:09.333 --> 00:01:11.833
I will wait for the price of 105 yuan.

32
00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:13.566
Sweep the grain from the county yamen granary

33
00:01:13.566 --> 00:01:15.133
The county yamen took our money

34
00:01:15.133 --> 00:01:17.266
Buy at the price of 93 yuan a bucket.

35
00:01:17.266 --> 00:01:18.800
Selling at 90

36
00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.033
come and go

37
00:01:20.266 --> 00:01:22.566
He actually paid money when he arrived at the station

38
00:01:31.766 --> 00:01:33.700
Lamb lamb

39
00:01:33.766 --> 00:01:35.800
The old man thought it was him

40
00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.900
No hurry

41
00:01:38.966 --> 00:01:40.366
I can still wait

42
00:01:40.366 --> 00:01:44.100
I guess the county cliff granary should be full of sand

43
00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.900
As long as I work together

44
00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:46.966
Overcome the bottom line

45
00:01:47.133 --> 00:01:49.433
Her family will get warmer sooner or later

46
00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.066
I can still make a lot of money waiting

47
00:01:52.066 --> 00:01:54.266
But if I wait to sell

48
00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.766
The four major families in Linjiang City are finished

49
00:01:57.766 --> 00:01:59.100
Hello, the company is reasonable.

50
00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.766
I Linjiang City, the four major families advance and retreat together

51
00:02:01.766 --> 00:02:04.066
As long as I wait for him to master the food, I may not lose

52
00:02:04.066 --> 00:02:04.900
The old man returned to the house this time

53
00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:07.966
Order to ban a grain from leaving the market

54
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.000
The Lin family can rest assured

55
00:02:11.366 --> 00:02:13.266
We are all like brothers

56
00:02:13.266 --> 00:02:15.433
Never cause harm to others and self-interest

57
00:02:19.266 --> 00:02:19.933
Mr. Ding

58
00:02:19.933 --> 00:02:22.900
I'm going to tell other people's teachers not to surrender a penny

59
00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.000
Ah, let's ship it.

60
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.366
The old man is not for sale

61
00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:27.800
What if he can sell you?

62
00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.033
If by then

63
00:02:30.166 --> 00:02:33.766
Waiting for the old man is the only way to go bankrupt

64
00:02:34.066 --> 00:02:35.666
strike first

65
00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.066
Suffer later

66
00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:38.600
Not for sale on the surface

67
00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.300
Secretly sell it to the old man as soon as possible

68
00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:42.966
In 90 characters, no

69
00:02:43.333 --> 00:02:45.100
At the price of 87 words

70
00:02:45.266 --> 00:02:46.333
overall vote count

71
00:02:46.333 --> 00:02:48.100
87 How do you sell it?

72
00:02:49.566 --> 00:02:51.666
If this batch of food falls into your hand

73
00:02:51.666 --> 00:02:54.400
My Lin family is completely over

74
00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.566
Go, yes, yes, go.
