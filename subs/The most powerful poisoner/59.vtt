00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:02.866
What about the common people?

2
00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:05.466
Strange that these breasts are not big

3
00:00:05.766 --> 00:00:06.900
Why so stupid

4
00:00:07.133 --> 00:00:08.500
For disaster victims

5
00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:10.733
Survival is their primary purpose

6
00:00:10.733 --> 00:00:13.100
Don't say it's ginseng fukang forage

7
00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:14.566
Even tree bark

8
00:00:14.566 --> 00:00:16.966
They have to eat Guanyin Tu when they are hungry

9
00:00:16.966 --> 00:00:20.466
Otherwise, where will the world come from and eat one child?

10
00:00:20.466 --> 00:00:22.300
Good Lamb

11
00:00:22.333 --> 00:00:25.833
I'm really impressed with you today

12
00:00:25.866 --> 00:00:27.300
With your brilliant plan

13
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.066
Even if Guanzhong yellow disaster

14
00:00:29.066 --> 00:00:32.000
But it can save hundreds of thousands of people from dying

15
00:00:32.066 --> 00:00:33.266
Tomorrow morning

16
00:00:33.366 --> 00:00:35.466
I will publish this method

17
00:00:35.466 --> 00:00:38.466
I see how greedy those corrupt officials are

18
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:42.466
Lamb, you have given me a wonderful plan for my emperor's disaster

19
00:00:42.533 --> 00:00:45.500
This is another great plan for my disaster food

20
00:00:45.733 --> 00:00:47.333
Tell me what you want.

21
00:00:47.333 --> 00:00:49.066
Throat haha

22
00:00:49.066 --> 00:00:52.300
Your Majesty, why are you so kind?

23
00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:54.000
Hahaha oh

24
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.866
Gao Aiqing is so polite

25
00:00:55.866 --> 00:00:58.800
Then pretend I didn't say it 2 Your Majesty, your golden words

26
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.266
How can you go back on your word?

27
00:01:00.266 --> 00:01:02.900
Okay, just say what you want

28
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.300
I have always been rewarded for my merits

29
00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.800
Never mistreat the hero of my big money

30
00:01:09.266 --> 00:01:10.666
Well your majesty

31
00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.333
I want a token

32
00:01:12.333 --> 00:01:14.200
Refuge in recent days

33
00:01:17.566 --> 00:01:22.233
Refuge, all of this will be given by Lord Shangguan

34
00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:25.733
Some normal human relations between Lord Du and his ministers

35
00:01:25.733 --> 00:01:29.666
He was actually tricked by Lord Shangguan

36
00:01:29.666 --> 00:01:31.900
My father hasn't opened the tea leaves yet

37
00:01:31.933 --> 00:01:33.266
If you have three or five friends

38
00:01:33.266 --> 00:01:34.733
The husband wants tea on a whim

39
00:01:34.733 --> 00:01:37.566
If I don't have a token to protect myself

40
00:01:37.566 --> 00:01:40.666
I am afraid that I will never have the opportunity to see His Majesty again

41
00:01:40.666 --> 00:01:44.033
Furthermore, His Majesty also knows that the minister is a drug rehabilitation oath

42
00:01:44.066 --> 00:01:45.800
Be cautious

43
00:01:46.166 --> 00:01:49.000
You are really worthy of your own identity

44
00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:50.266
Sure enough

45
00:01:56.333 --> 00:01:57.733
This is my token

46
00:01:57.733 --> 00:01:59.866
The token is like my presence

47
00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:01.466
Go back and tell Mr. Gao

48
00:02:01.466 --> 00:02:02.466
The child is old

49
00:02:02.466 --> 00:02:04.466
It's the humeral minister of the dynasty again

50
00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.666
It's not appropriate to hit again

51
00:02:08.733 --> 00:02:11.400
Thank you, Your Majesty

52
00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.300
Okay, step back

53
00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:14.833
I'm also a little tired

54
00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.600
minister retires

55
00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.166
Your Majesty, Prince Rong has been cultivating for many days

56
00:02:32.166 --> 00:02:35.800
I will send the imperial doctor to see how the cultivation is going later.

57
00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.300
It's time for morning tomorrow

58
00:02:38.333 --> 00:02:40.600
The corrupt officials in this world have more than half of the silver

59
00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:42.233
Both entered his mansion

60
00:02:42.366 --> 00:02:44.300
I have the plan of the lamb

61
00:02:44.333 --> 00:02:48.066
Go to court tomorrow, if you don't look at his expression

62
00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.600
It's a bit boring

63
00:02:51.066 --> 00:02:53.633
He is the grandson of the Duke of Jin

64
00:02:54.266 --> 00:02:55.866
Hidden so deep

65
00:02:55.866 --> 00:02:57.300
So talented

66
00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.033
Pretending to be no different from a stubborn child

67
00:03:00.133 --> 00:03:02.900
I almost cheated myself

68
00:03:02.933 --> 00:03:05.633
The Gao family is also considered a successor

69
00:03:05.733 --> 00:03:08.166
His Majesty is very optimistic about this lamb

70
00:03:08.166 --> 00:03:11.700
His talent can be our prime minister

71
00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.766
Even if Cui Xinghe and Xu Xiang add up

72
00:03:14.766 --> 00:03:17.600
Not half as talented as him

73
00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:19.166
But this person

74
00:03:19.333 --> 00:03:22.266
The advantages and disadvantages are too obvious

75
00:03:22.333 --> 00:03:25.533
It's a virtue of insight.

76
00:03:25.533 --> 00:03:27.966
Playing with human nature is very strong

77
00:03:27.966 --> 00:03:30.033
He's a genius.

78
00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:31.600
What about the downsides?

79
00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:32.633
disadvantage

80
00:03:33.166 --> 00:03:35.000
Lustful of money, it never falls

81
00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:37.500
Did you know that it has just been a few hours?

82
00:03:38.866 --> 00:03:41.066
25 eyes off your chest

83
00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:42.833
But left my leg

84
00:03:43.166 --> 00:03:45.200
173 eyes
