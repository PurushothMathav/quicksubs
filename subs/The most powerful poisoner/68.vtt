1
00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:05.700
What about Chen Sheng?

2
00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:08.066
Chen Sheng did not return last night

3
00:00:08.066 --> 00:00:10.366
After returning early in the morning, he went straight to the eldest son's room

4
00:00:10.366 --> 00:00:11.800
But the eldest son has not returned yet

5
00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.433
He went out again, Village Chief

6
00:00:14.566 --> 00:00:16.266
The Lord will let me learn from you

7
00:00:16.266 --> 00:00:18.633
This confinement is killing me

8
00:00:19.066 --> 00:00:21.433
Where are we going to play?

9
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:23.300
Rouge Pavilion

10
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.400
Then how much silver do we have?

11
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.700
The cost of this qualification is not low.

12
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:31.700
How much silver can I play with?

13
00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:34.600
Oh, if you stay overnight?

14
00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.233
The average girl needs dozens of taels of silver

15
00:00:37.533 --> 00:00:40.100
A better one costs hundreds of taels of silver

16
00:00:40.266 --> 00:00:42.766
The Four Oroses Across the Cigarette

17
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.700
Any estimate

18
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.966
A few thousand taels of silver

19
00:00:47.966 --> 00:00:49.766
So violent?

20
00:00:49.766 --> 00:00:52.666
As the so-called father and son

21
00:00:52.733 --> 00:00:55.100
Hook up two brothers

22
00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.100
Vegetarian smoke and oarouri

23
00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:02.000
On the day of the eagle's paw, he got a lot of silver

24
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.700
I think it's better for us to have a luxury, hahaha.

25
00:01:35.366 --> 00:01:37.333
Oh your majesty double happiness

26
00:01:37.333 --> 00:01:39.800
General Wang Zhong sent the liberation 50,000 level pressure army

27
00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:40.600
Everywhere

28
00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.433
Emperor Zhongtian Armor can't help it

29
00:01:42.966 --> 00:01:45.666
The lamb is too heaven-defying every time

30
00:01:45.933 --> 00:01:47.866
Never let him run away

31
00:01:48.466 --> 00:01:52.100
I must make him obediently be my hero minister

32
00:01:53.066 --> 00:01:55.233
Kojiro has just been released from prison

33
00:01:55.266 --> 00:01:57.233
People can be in the house

34
00:01:57.866 --> 00:01:59.933
Your Majesty wants to leave the palace

35
00:01:59.933 --> 00:02:01.100
This palace

36
00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.300
I'm so bored that I want to go out for a walk

37
00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.266
And I still have some doubts in my heart

38
00:02:07.266 --> 00:02:10.033
Maybe the lamb can struggle

39
00:02:10.166 --> 00:02:11.866
The old slave went to inquire immediately

40
00:02:16.933 --> 00:02:18.500
Your Majesty estimates that

41
00:02:18.866 --> 00:02:21.833
Your groom is not in the house

42
00:02:24.733 --> 00:02:26.300
Don't care

43
00:02:26.866 --> 00:02:28.200
Where did he go?

44
00:02:28.333 --> 00:02:31.033
Lamb he just got out of jail

45
00:02:31.766 --> 00:02:33.233
Just went to the rouge shell

46
00:02:37.466 --> 00:02:39.100
Rouge Court

47
00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.666
Rouge Pavilion, one of the four brothels in Chang'an

48
00:02:44.333 --> 00:02:47.166
I happen to have never been to such a place

49
00:02:47.333 --> 00:02:49.033
Interested today

50
00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.700
Come with me to see
