00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:12.000
Sky wolf you touch yours

2
00:00:12.166 --> 00:00:13.166
I want to be cautious

3
00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:15.066
Be bold and be yourself

4
00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.800
Haha, you are weird

5
00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.566
It's just that the tone doesn't sound easy

6
00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:32.900
I've studied a lot about the law of big money

7
00:00:33.333 --> 00:00:34.400
Offend the empress

8
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.100
But the mouth is long

9
00:00:36.133 --> 00:00:38.466
You already have two by your side.

10
00:00:38.533 --> 00:00:39.333
Note

11
00:00:39.866 --> 00:00:41.266
I can't chew

12
00:00:41.366 --> 00:00:44.333
Even if you can stand your kidney

13
00:00:44.333 --> 00:00:46.233
Hey, can't stand it either?

14
00:00:46.733 --> 00:00:48.666
Don't be too stingy

15
00:00:50.166 --> 00:00:53.100
Mr. Gao doesn't have many customers during the day

16
00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.233
If the son has any needs

17
00:00:55.766 --> 00:00:58.200
That Rouge Pavilion still has many sisters

18
00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.066
Liu Huakui heard that the lord punished the profiteers

19
00:01:01.066 --> 00:01:02.266
Also quite admirable

20
00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.300
Do you want to have a drink with the adults?

21
00:01:05.166 --> 00:01:10.600
Brother Hua Gui, your famous son is good, right?

22
00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.600
Drink for free first

23
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.066
Now you can, hey, hey, white strips, haha.

24
00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.633
No, let the government continue

25
00:01:20.766 --> 00:01:22.233
Don't lose your head

26
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.266
Chen Lamb greets His Majesty

27
00:01:33.533 --> 00:01:34.400
I am not a wolf

28
00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.400
Gao Shangwen also met His Majesty for the second time at the peak

29
00:01:37.733 --> 00:01:40.766
I am a private visitor to the groom

30
00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.400
I'm eager to bring the news of my coming to the brothel

31
00:01:43.533 --> 00:01:45.266
Spread throughout Chang'an

32
00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.266
Even if I am a woman

33
00:01:47.266 --> 00:01:50.466
I'm afraid that the next day, this imperial history will also leave

34
00:01:50.466 --> 00:01:51.366
talk about

35
00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.400
I understand, please rest assured, Your Majesty

36
00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.633
I just said a few words and you will understand.

37
00:01:57.533 --> 00:02:01.800
Come on, I'll send someone to kill you

38
00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:03.566
And Chen, this younger brother, is the first not to

39
00:02:03.866 --> 00:02:06.533
So it won't reveal the whereabouts of the Bi family?

40
00:02:06.533 --> 00:02:08.266
Ah forgive me

41
00:02:08.266 --> 00:02:10.400
Your Majesty, come, Your Majesty, forgive me!

42
00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:12.033
Hahaha Your Majesty

43
00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.433
Okay, it's not that brutal

44
00:02:15.866 --> 00:02:17.200
Get up first

45
00:02:22.733 --> 00:02:25.033
Gaoyang sitting

46
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.666
I came today

47
00:02:32.333 --> 00:02:34.300
There is a key to discuss with you.

48
00:02:35.766 --> 00:02:38.366
It is the duty of an official to solve problems for His Majesty

49
00:02:38.366 --> 00:02:39.966
Just your eyes

50
00:02:40.266 --> 00:02:41.400
People are a little scared

51
00:02:41.666 --> 00:02:44.566
If you help me solve this problem

52
00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.600
As long as it's not a big crime for you

53
00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.033
I promise you

54
00:02:48.133 --> 00:02:49.833
Keep you prosperous

55
00:02:50.866 --> 00:02:54.466
As a part of the big money, I will solve His Majesty's problems

56
00:02:54.533 --> 00:02:56.500
That should be doing your best

57
00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:00.066
Just do we want to go somewhere else?

58
00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.466
Talking stories in a brothel

59
00:03:02.866 --> 00:03:04.366
It sounds a little weird.

60
00:03:04.366 --> 00:03:06.633
If this is recorded in the history books in the future

61
00:03:06.733 --> 00:03:08.600
It doesn't always sound good.

62
00:03:08.666 --> 00:03:10.466
Heroes don't ask where they come from

63
00:03:10.866 --> 00:03:13.566
Powerful countries naturally do not distinguish between occasions

64
00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:17.766
Beautiful woman

65
00:03:20.366 --> 00:03:22.366
Wait a minute.

66
00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.766
Since he is a lazy son who just slept

67
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.466
Just sit up and listen

68
00:03:28.866 --> 00:03:32.666
Gao Yang, do you know how powerful the vassal king of Daqian is?

69
00:03:32.666 --> 00:03:34.800
This makes me uneasy.

70
00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.500
You hold a grudge

71
00:03:37.466 --> 00:03:38.433
Have a plan
