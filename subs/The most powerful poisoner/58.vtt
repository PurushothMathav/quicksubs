1
00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.300
Lamb, do you think this yellow disaster

2
00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:07.300
It's really a punishment from heaven

3
00:00:07.733 --> 00:00:09.533
This is nonsense.

4
00:00:09.533 --> 00:00:11.200
The yellow disaster is not so much a punishment

5
00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:12.966
It's better to say drought and flood

6
00:00:12.966 --> 00:00:14.433
That's God's punishment

7
00:00:14.733 --> 00:00:17.300
It's just a biological phenomenon.

8
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.733
I don't think this is a law from heaven either

9
00:00:20.733 --> 00:00:23.666
But I think man can conquer heaven

10
00:00:23.966 --> 00:00:27.133
However, I must remind Your Majesty

11
00:00:27.133 --> 00:00:30.000
Biological control uses artificial means to intervene

12
00:00:30.166 --> 00:00:32.166
Only reduce the harm of yellow disasters

13
00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.166
There will still be yellow disasters

14
00:00:34.166 --> 00:00:35.366
It's inevitable.

15
00:00:35.366 --> 00:00:38.900
It's just that the scariest thing has never been a yellow disaster

16
00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:41.400
But the particles after the yellow disaster have not been harvested

17
00:00:41.466 --> 00:00:43.966
Your Majesty, you must be prepared for disaster

18
00:00:44.666 --> 00:00:46.066
The ceremony you mentioned

19
00:00:46.866 --> 00:00:48.800
I naturally know

20
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:49.933
Yellow disasters over the years

21
00:00:49.933 --> 00:00:51.966
No matter the big yellow disaster or the small yellow disaster

22
00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.700
This imperial court disaster

23
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.466
Pay a huge price

24
00:00:55.566 --> 00:00:56.800
But the effect

25
00:00:57.333 --> 00:00:59.000
Almost insignificant

26
00:00:59.066 --> 00:01:00.966
Disaster relief grain issued by Chaotian

27
00:01:00.966 --> 00:01:02.900
After layers of corruption

28
00:01:03.066 --> 00:01:05.600
Less than 30% of the people are in the hands of the people

29
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.100
Even if the emperors of the past dynasties decreed corruption against the good ones

30
00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:10.466
Its master is full of doors

31
00:01:10.566 --> 00:01:12.666
But the effect is minimal.

32
00:01:13.933 --> 00:01:16.800
But the court had to calm the disaster

33
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.466
Otherwise, there will be more casualties

34
00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.366
Lamb about this official's corruption of disaster food

35
00:01:25.966 --> 00:01:27.000
Why don't you

36
00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:30.500
Your Majesty, greed is human nature

37
00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:31.533
It's human nature.

38
00:01:31.533 --> 00:01:33.166
This can't be completely eliminated

39
00:01:33.333 --> 00:01:36.400
If I decree corruption to suppress disasters

40
00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.366
Peel it, Hemerocallis is this heavy

41
00:01:39.366 --> 00:01:41.366
Can we curb human involvement?

42
00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.000
Your Majesty, don't say it's corruption.

43
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.300
Even if His Majesty ordered the corruption of 60 taels

44
00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:47.600
You have to peel the skin of the hemerocallis

45
00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.133
Even executed in the street

46
00:01:49.133 --> 00:01:50.600
Be greedy or be greedy

47
00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:51.800
No use at all

48
00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.333
Then I can only watch

49
00:01:53.333 --> 00:01:55.366
Watching them embezzle disaster food?

50
00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.433
Uh greed can't be eliminated

51
00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.166
But reduce the corruption of disaster food

52
00:02:01.533 --> 00:02:03.200
I have a few ways to do it.

53
00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:04.200
lamb

54
00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:06.600
What can you do?

55
00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.133
The solution is quite simple

56
00:02:08.133 --> 00:02:10.800
It just doesn't sound good to say

57
00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:14.766
And His Majesty may also bear the burden of infamy

58
00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.300
As long as you can save the people from fire and water

59
00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:18.800
Deliver the disaster food in good condition

60
00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.600
What is a mere infamy in the hands of the common people?

61
00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.533
However, this prevents corrupt officials from attacking the disaster food

62
00:02:25.533 --> 00:02:27.133
It's not a good thing.

63
00:02:27.133 --> 00:02:28.100
Why I

64
00:02:28.866 --> 00:02:30.200
And infamy.

65
00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.200
The minister's way is to go to the disaster food

66
00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.766
Add to the fodder eaten by the animals

67
00:02:36.766 --> 00:02:38.866
Husband is even

68
00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.000
fine sand high yang

69
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.100
What the hell are you doing?

70
00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:44.933
Take what humans eat, what animals eat.

71
00:02:44.933 --> 00:02:46.800
How can we eat this grain?

72
00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.500
And once the yellow disaster in the palace breaks out

73
00:02:49.533 --> 00:02:51.266
Unscrupulous among the people

74
00:02:51.266 --> 00:02:52.900
They're miserable enough

75
00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.166
You have to put it in their food.

76
00:02:54.166 --> 00:02:55.333
Go to these things

77
00:02:55.333 --> 00:02:57.200
Then how can they live and play?

78
00:02:59.066 --> 00:03:00.266
You misunderstood him.

79
00:03:04.766 --> 00:03:05.900
The treasury is empty

80
00:03:06.066 --> 00:03:08.200
Positive disaster food is definitely not enough

81
00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.466
Those officials embezzled disaster food

82
00:03:10.466 --> 00:03:12.333
It's nothing more than for huge profits

83
00:03:12.333 --> 00:03:14.100
Interests win people's hearts since ancient times

84
00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.100
This is the same as the soaring grain prices in Linjiang City

85
00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.600
Natural disaster knowledge people have no harvest

86
00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:21.266
That drives up food prices.

87
00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:24.066
This grain merchant will stockpile grain for huge profits

88
00:03:24.166 --> 00:03:26.000
Same with these officials.

89
00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.566
They are embezzling good food.

90
00:03:27.666 --> 00:03:29.666
Partly for self-driving

91
00:03:29.666 --> 00:03:32.100
The other part is to sell at a high price

92
00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:33.166
In exchange for operation

93
00:03:33.166 --> 00:03:37.800
Then once I join Fukang in this disaster food

94
00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:41.300
Herbal medicine, then this disaster food can't be sold

95
00:03:41.566 --> 00:03:42.700
Even if it is sold

96
00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:44.066
That won't sell for a high price either.

97
00:03:44.133 --> 00:03:45.800
There is no high profit drive

98
00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:47.366
Then these officials

99
00:03:47.366 --> 00:03:50.033
Who's willing to risk the sand?

100
00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:51.900
But take the risk

101
00:03:51.933 --> 00:03:53.666
Let alone eat at home

102
00:03:53.666 --> 00:03:54.600
Even corrupt officials

103
00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.666
That must be pampering

104
00:03:56.666 --> 00:03:58.066
hedonistic people

105
00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:59.466
Which official?

106
00:03:59.466 --> 00:04:01.800
Willing to eat this meal of sand food

107
00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.766
So

108
00:04:02.766 --> 00:04:04.300
You can reject corruption.

109
00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:05.300
Even greed

110
00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:06.600
That's not much greed

111
00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:09.900
After all, when the risks and benefits are not proportional

112
00:04:09.933 --> 00:04:12.500
Officials don't take risks
