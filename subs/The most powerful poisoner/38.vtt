1
00:00:09.333 --> 00:00:13.066
Could it be that I read it wrong?

2
00:00:14.266 --> 00:00:18.100
You really let me down

3
00:00:20.533 --> 00:00:21.466
That's all.

4
00:00:22.366 --> 00:00:23.833
armchair talk

5
00:00:25.266 --> 00:00:27.900
It's hard to be an adult after all

6
00:00:30.366 --> 00:00:30.900
Your Majesty

7
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.566
Lord Shangguan sent someone to send a letter quickly

8
00:00:33.566 --> 00:00:35.900
There is no need for underground relatives to be more than that

9
00:00:35.933 --> 00:00:38.466
Lord Gu also sent someone to send a memorial here

10
00:00:38.533 --> 00:00:39.400
And specifically asked

11
00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:42.833
This memorial requires underground relatives to be called imperial historians

12
00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.700
Could it be that Linjiang City has aroused public anger?

13
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:03.366
Hahahahaha

14
00:01:04.133 --> 00:01:06.466
I really didn't see the wrong person.

15
00:01:06.466 --> 00:01:10.566
The sword officials from Yushitai have been disgusted with me these days.

16
00:01:10.566 --> 00:01:14.400
I must have a good day tomorrow

17
00:01:15.266 --> 00:01:16.333
This memorial

18
00:01:16.333 --> 00:01:17.666
You don't need to copy.

19
00:01:17.666 --> 00:01:18.833
Let's all go down

20
00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.866
Food prices fell 1.50 million day

21
00:01:25.866 --> 00:01:28.900
Even down to 50 trillion

22
00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.800
What a grandson of Duke Ding

23
00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.433
I still underestimate

24
00:01:47.866 --> 00:01:52.100
Hey, I'm finally back after so much tossing

25
00:01:52.366 --> 00:01:56.166
This time I must relax

26
00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:57.966
How can it be called tossing?

27
00:01:57.966 --> 00:01:59.466
This is about doing things for big money.

28
00:01:59.666 --> 00:02:02.266
Officials should do their best for the people

29
00:02:02.266 --> 00:02:03.066
dead

30
00:02:03.066 --> 00:02:04.433
This is a great honor

31
00:02:04.933 --> 00:02:06.800
Lord Shangguan is right

32
00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.200
As long as Lord Shangguan is happy

33
00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.200
High official responsibility in history

34
00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:15.800
Your Majesty has a purpose

35
00:02:19.866 --> 00:02:21.133
This morning

36
00:02:21.133 --> 00:02:22.966
His Majesty wants to summon

37
00:02:26.866 --> 00:02:28.666
Your Majesty is here
