00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:02.266
Lord Du

2
00:00:02.533 --> 00:00:05.133
What are the actions of these four Liang merchants today?

3
00:00:05.133 --> 00:00:07.366
Since the county yamen posted the visit

4
00:00:07.366 --> 00:00:10.366
Four Liang merchants at the price of 100 words a bucket

5
00:00:10.366 --> 00:00:13.333
Crazy sweeps the food in the hands of other small beam merchants

6
00:00:13.333 --> 00:00:15.800
Even if it is 150 yuan, it will not be sold.

7
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.300
Lead to rising food prices

8
00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.500
Now they are hoarding grain

9
00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.700
Waiting for the common people to run out of food

10
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.500
Keep raising food prices

11
00:00:25.533 --> 00:00:29.366
Now it is 200 yuan, and a bucket is not for sale.

12
00:00:32.366 --> 00:00:34.400
Hiring tomorrow

13
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:35.800
Start renovating the house

14
00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.500
Another post

15
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.233
I'm going to hold a grand dragon boat race

16
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.500
The winner.

17
00:00:44.133 --> 00:00:46.433
Tax-free for three years

18
00:00:46.966 --> 00:00:48.566
You are a disaster to the country

19
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.666
This order is subject to official policy

20
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:52.766
Dangao I

21
00:00:52.866 --> 00:00:55.166
Even if you are the grandson of Duke Ding

22
00:00:55.166 --> 00:00:56.933
But caused such a big disaster

23
00:00:56.933 --> 00:00:58.700
You can't afford the consequences.

24
00:00:59.866 --> 00:01:02.033
What exactly does Mr. Gao want to do?

25
00:01:02.166 --> 00:01:03.266
If you don't say

26
00:01:03.266 --> 00:01:05.233
I can only take over Linjiang City for you

27
00:01:05.733 --> 00:01:06.733
Lord Shangguan

28
00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:08.333
Please hurry up.

29
00:01:08.333 --> 00:01:09.066
otherwise

30
00:01:09.066 --> 00:01:13.533
The people are scratching all over the place, trying to cause irreparable disaster

31
00:01:13.533 --> 00:01:15.300
You clearly don't like Buddha

32
00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:16.866
I have met many believers in Chang'an City

33
00:01:16.866 --> 00:01:19.133
There was something in their eyes

34
00:01:19.133 --> 00:01:20.466
Inexplicable frenzy

35
00:01:20.733 --> 00:01:21.866
But you didn't

36
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.500
You visited the temple these days

37
00:01:24.566 --> 00:01:25.766
It's not your beauty

38
00:01:25.766 --> 00:01:27.400
Even repairing those county cliffs

39
00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.066
Also inexplicable

40
00:01:29.066 --> 00:01:30.366
Why repair the county cliff?

41
00:01:30.366 --> 00:01:31.733
Why should the Liang family rise?

42
00:01:31.733 --> 00:01:33.066
Why carry some infamy

43
00:01:33.066 --> 00:01:35.200
You will leave Chang'an in a few days

44
00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.766
Bao Gongzi must give me an explanation for all this

45
00:01:39.166 --> 00:01:41.500
Lord Du still remembers seven days ago

46
00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.766
Did I say a word to you?

47
00:01:44.466 --> 00:01:47.200
But if you want to reduce the price of food

48
00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.700
You don't have to push down food prices.

49
00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.033
But food prices skyrocketed

50
00:01:51.166 --> 00:01:52.366
Valley Greed

51
00:01:52.366 --> 00:01:53.733
Don't harvest a wave

52
00:01:53.733 --> 00:01:55.500
Will they stop

53
00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.466
Lord Zhou, I want to ask the alliance of the four good merchants

54
00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:00.666
Despite strong pressure

55
00:02:00.733 --> 00:02:01.900
How much can food prices fall?

56
00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:03.800
80,000 or 180,000

57
00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:05.466
Even down to 800,000

58
00:02:05.466 --> 00:02:07.300
How many people can afford it?

59
00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:09.000
Unless you take a butcher knife

60
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.900
Kill them all

61
00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:12.600
But once you start cinnabar

62
00:02:12.966 --> 00:02:15.766
All products will be on guard.

63
00:02:15.766 --> 00:02:17.600
But only for ordinary people

64
00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.600
It doesn't matter if it's one in 100 or one in 150.

65
00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.366
Or 200 characters

66
00:02:22.366 --> 00:02:23.766
There's no difference at all.

67
00:02:23.866 --> 00:02:25.366
They could never afford it.

68
00:02:25.366 --> 00:02:27.300
But grain prices in Linjiang City skyrocketed

69
00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.533
Even the government ordered no less than 150 trillion

70
00:02:30.533 --> 00:02:31.333
Sell him

71
00:02:33.533 --> 00:02:35.366
Wand Han

72
00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:39.133
The four Liang chambers of commerce are greedily raiding the local food

73
00:02:39.133 --> 00:02:40.133
Raise food prices

74
00:02:40.133 --> 00:02:42.866
Even small local grain merchants

75
00:02:43.133 --> 00:02:44.966
Delusional selling at a sky-high price

76
00:02:46.766 --> 00:02:49.200
Greed is human nature

77
00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.700
But all businesspeople in the world are greedy

78
00:02:51.866 --> 00:02:55.600
But also the news that the price of Linjiang City has skyrocketed

79
00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:58.066
Will spread around at a terrifying rate

80
00:02:58.066 --> 00:02:58.866
ton

81
00:02:58.933 --> 00:03:02.100
In recent days, by the road outside the city gate

82
00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.700
The wagons and cargo ships that deliver food every day

83
00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:06.266
They are constantly being delivered.

84
00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:07.500
This Riverside City

85
00:03:07.533 --> 00:03:10.233
The number of foreign grain merchants is increasing every day

86
00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:14.233
Nowadays, there is no shortage of people in this Riverside City

87
00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.700
Now this family in Linjiang City

88
00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:19.966
Like a giant balloon looking at him

89
00:03:23.766 --> 00:03:26.766
These Gemini are delusional about a national disaster

90
00:03:26.766 --> 00:03:29.966
Just this time, I will call them

91
00:03:30.333 --> 00:03:33.200
Broken family
