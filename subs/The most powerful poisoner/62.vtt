1
00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.700
A few veterans please haha

2
00:00:08.766 --> 00:00:11.300
There is no need to be too polite about your friendship with me.

3
00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:14.466
In the future, the old man will be reliable after a hundred years

4
00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:17.966
I still rely on a few husbands, hahaha.

5
00:00:18.333 --> 00:00:21.333
The old duke should be unfairly ill

6
00:00:21.333 --> 00:00:23.600
Take care of me more in the future.

7
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.733
Yeah, your boy's performance these days

8
00:00:26.733 --> 00:00:29.200
Even if it is the old man's Lutheran Sutra

9
00:00:29.266 --> 00:00:31.500
Ah, the memories of merchants.

10
00:00:31.566 --> 00:00:33.066
Huang Chong's memories?

11
00:00:33.066 --> 00:00:36.233
Is it still the memory of corrupt officials?

12
00:00:36.333 --> 00:00:38.466
Hahahaha

13
00:00:39.066 --> 00:00:42.766
Where did this corrupt official's living hell come from?

14
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:43.966
Early morning

15
00:00:43.966 --> 00:00:46.766
His Majesty announced that he would use disaster food for the audience

16
00:00:46.766 --> 00:00:49.333
He also said to add some sand to the grain

17
00:00:49.333 --> 00:00:50.566
Baiguan exploded directly

18
00:00:50.566 --> 00:00:52.466
King Rong Qin was the first to stand up

19
00:00:52.466 --> 00:00:54.400
Accuse His Majesty of mistreating the people

20
00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.900
It's the act of a fool

21
00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:00.300
Then the 13 imperial historians cooked in indignation

22
00:01:00.466 --> 00:01:03.933
He even stated on the spot that if His Majesty insists on going his own way

23
00:01:03.933 --> 00:01:05.733
He was killed in the palace of money

24
00:01:05.733 --> 00:01:07.966
Not this majesty

25
00:01:08.466 --> 00:01:09.566
So confused

26
00:01:09.566 --> 00:01:11.733
Haha confused

27
00:01:11.733 --> 00:01:13.733
It's not just you who think so

28
00:01:13.733 --> 00:01:15.300
I thought so too

29
00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:17.066
But what happened next

30
00:01:17.166 --> 00:01:19.166
It just stunned all of us

31
00:01:19.166 --> 00:01:21.766
His Majesty said to help Liangchen mix the sand

32
00:01:21.766 --> 00:01:24.100
It cannot be sold at a high price in the circulation market

33
00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.466
Corrupt officials will not eat the skin mixed with sand

34
00:01:27.466 --> 00:01:28.700
Corrupt officials along the way

35
00:01:29.266 --> 00:01:31.166
We wouldn't have risked beheading them.

36
00:01:31.166 --> 00:01:32.600
Go greedy for the grain of good disaster

37
00:01:32.733 --> 00:01:33.800
So

38
00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.666
The people affected by the disaster have more hope for life

39
00:01:36.666 --> 00:01:37.700
As soon as this flower comes out

40
00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.500
I was shocked.

41
00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.133
The 13 royal historians with names for women

42
00:01:42.133 --> 00:01:44.066
And Prince Rong Xu Equal?

43
00:01:44.066 --> 00:01:47.033
Lie is all green, that is called a wonderful

44
00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:49.400
This is an underground strategy

45
00:01:49.766 --> 00:01:51.366
What does it have to do with sheep?

46
00:01:51.366 --> 00:01:54.033
But the whole court knew it

47
00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.466
His Majesty left your grandson alone yesterday afternoon

48
00:01:57.466 --> 00:01:59.866
Wait until the whole big front can be poisoned

49
00:01:59.866 --> 00:02:02.033
Journalists Except for the Lambs of the High House

50
00:02:02.066 --> 00:02:03.433
Who else?

51
00:02:06.266 --> 00:02:08.700
The old duke this morning

52
00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.000
This son made the Dragon Prince eat force

53
00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:13.666
In his character

54
00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.266
Will definitely attack the prince of the empire

55
00:02:16.333 --> 00:02:17.166
More needed.

56
00:02:17.166 --> 00:02:19.000
Be careful, old man

57
00:02:19.166 --> 00:02:20.366
After talking for so long

58
00:02:20.566 --> 00:02:22.666
I haven't met your stubborn grandson yet

59
00:02:22.966 --> 00:02:24.066
Call him out

60
00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:25.666
Let the old man take a good look

61
00:02:25.666 --> 00:02:27.166
Yeah, not bad.

62
00:02:27.366 --> 00:02:29.333
The old man should also ask carefully

63
00:02:29.333 --> 00:02:29.600
Ok ok

64
00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.900
Go back and train my children and grandchildren who don't teach

65
00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.466
Hahaha go

66
00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:36.433
Welcome two children

67
00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:38.300
Drink tea drink tea

68
00:02:40.733 --> 00:02:41.533
Bah

69
00:02:42.133 --> 00:02:44.700
Wife, you are not authentic

70
00:02:45.566 --> 00:02:47.866
That mansion made a terrible poison oath

71
00:02:47.866 --> 00:02:50.833
Please ask me to wait for tea like this.

72
00:02:50.966 --> 00:02:53.433
Hurry up and take out the good tea in the mansion

73
00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.366
Nice brown

74
00:02:55.366 --> 00:02:57.500
Selling good tea?

75
00:02:57.866 --> 00:02:59.933
Take it easy, old generals

76
00:02:59.933 --> 00:03:02.900
Quanzi went to Linjiang City a few days ago

77
00:03:02.933 --> 00:03:04.566
Due to the decrease in food prices

78
00:03:04.566 --> 00:03:07.000
So the local county magistrate Du Jiang

79
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.733
I specially sent a box of good tea leaves.

80
00:03:08.733 --> 00:03:10.166
It has not been opened yet.

81
00:03:10.166 --> 00:03:13.400
Let's taste it with the old generals today

82
00:03:13.566 --> 00:03:14.266
Come

83
00:03:14.266 --> 00:03:17.833
Bring the tea from the bottom of the cabinet in the room
