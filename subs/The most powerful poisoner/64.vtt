00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:01.233
Father

2
00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:04.466
Your son has already reminded you that this piece must not live, right?

3
00:00:04.466 --> 00:00:06.066
Hey, okay, okay, okay.

4
00:00:06.566 --> 00:00:07.466
Not this box.

5
00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:08.933
Go to my room quickly

6
00:00:08.933 --> 00:00:10.833
Bring me my treasured meal

7
00:00:11.133 --> 00:00:13.200
It's haha, old man

8
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.600
The old man is getting old

9
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:17.733
These eyes and ears don't work well, hahaha.

10
00:00:17.733 --> 00:00:20.400
Hey, the old man didn't see anything either, right, right?

11
00:00:21.133 --> 00:00:21.900
Ah!

12
00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.466
The old generals were confused for a while just now.

13
00:00:25.466 --> 00:00:28.500
So I'll take it down and teach it first.

14
00:00:28.533 --> 00:00:29.700
No adults allowed hahaha

15
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:31.000
This teaching today

16
00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:33.866
He is dying

17
00:00:34.466 --> 00:00:36.300
The iron selection order predicted by His Majesty

18
00:00:36.466 --> 00:00:37.500
How can you have

19
00:00:37.966 --> 00:00:39.966
Yesterday, my son offered advice to His Majesty

20
00:00:39.966 --> 00:00:41.766
His Majesty specially bestowed upon his son

21
00:00:41.766 --> 00:00:43.666
He also specially asked his son to listen carefully

22
00:00:43.666 --> 00:00:46.066
The father said that the son is the male bone of the Qing Dynasty

23
00:00:46.066 --> 00:00:47.400
He doesn't hurt on a business trip.

24
00:00:47.566 --> 00:00:49.266
I've long heard that this kid is a drug addict

25
00:00:49.266 --> 00:00:50.466
Mainly hens

26
00:00:50.466 --> 00:00:51.500
See you today

27
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.266
It really lives up to its reputation.

28
00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.866
Okay, enough gossip

29
00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:59.533
The old man called a few people here today to discuss the art of war

30
00:00:59.533 --> 00:01:01.500
Da Chu and I are adjacent to Da Qin

31
00:01:01.866 --> 00:01:03.800
7 Ambition is not small

32
00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.400
Today, I will talk about it. If you send troops to Dachu

33
00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.100
What will be achieved at the smallest cost?

34
00:01:10.166 --> 00:01:12.400
Will be able to conquer Dachu

35
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.666
Overlord is vast and sparsely populated

36
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:15.866
City sharp

37
00:01:15.866 --> 00:01:16.966
Another attack

38
00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.000
Casualties are bound to be small

39
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Since ancient times

40
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.466
This siege is the hardest bone to crack

41
00:01:22.466 --> 00:01:23.866
Except for the onslaught

42
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.366
Can you still hum?

43
00:01:27.966 --> 00:01:30.600
This project has been the deadliest

44
00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.500
Who doesn't know this?

45
00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.566
Ah, you're here to take off your pants and fart

46
00:01:35.733 --> 00:01:37.233
The old man posted it.

47
00:01:37.466 --> 00:01:40.033
I should have been connected to engineering equipment before I got there

48
00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:42.000
Such as a catapult

49
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.800
You can surprise yourself by digging some tunnels and getting loud

50
00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.066
This catapult is too big

51
00:01:48.366 --> 00:01:50.066
And it's incredibly inaccurate.

52
00:01:50.166 --> 00:01:53.066
The city wall of Dachu is tall and adobe

53
00:01:53.166 --> 00:01:54.700
I'm afraid I won't play

54
00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:57.600
Besides, is this tunnel far away?

55
00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:58.766
Time consuming and laborious

56
00:01:58.766 --> 00:01:59.966
Is it close?

57
00:01:59.966 --> 00:02:02.400
Do you think the soldiers of Dachu are blind?

58
00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.833
Hmph, we can attack then

59
00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.166
Hmph, look at the history of storming

60
00:02:08.166 --> 00:02:09.666
Casualties are often huge

61
00:02:09.666 --> 00:02:12.700
If I continue to attack after this negotiation

62
00:02:12.766 --> 00:02:13.966
Then I'll wait and sit here

63
00:02:13.966 --> 00:02:15.366
What's the point?

64
00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:16.200
Lao Tzu

65
00:02:17.133 --> 00:02:18.966
I am waiting for the visit of the merchant

66
00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:20.666
What are you doing?

67
00:02:20.966 --> 00:02:22.433
Eat some Lingnan lychees

68
00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.200
Violated the law
