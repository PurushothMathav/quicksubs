00:00:03.966 --> 00:00:07.300
Miss Song, what a coincidence!

2
00:00:07.333 --> 00:00:09.866
Haha oops

3
00:00:10.366 --> 00:00:12.666
Well, it was as I expected

4
00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:15.600
As long as I appear before this lamb

5
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:19.400
It will stick to it like a dog

6
00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:23.600
Hahaha, is something wrong with Mr. Gao?

7
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.466
Haha, I said I knew Miss Song

8
00:00:27.466 --> 00:00:29.000
You don't believe it yet

9
00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:30.900
They are the imperial court compound

10
00:00:30.966 --> 00:00:32.100
Are you making money?

11
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:33.866
you you me

12
00:00:42.133 --> 00:00:44.366
The son consumed 103 yuan

13
00:00:44.366 --> 00:00:48.166
Miss Song, do you want to give it now or count it together later?

14
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.000
Gaoyang

15
00:00:51.966 --> 00:00:52.800
roll

16
00:00:58.533 --> 00:00:59.366
Gao Yang, where have you been?

17
00:00:59.366 --> 00:01:00.533
Do you know how long I've been waiting for you?

18
00:01:00.533 --> 00:01:01.866
How long have I been out looking for you?

19
00:01:02.166 --> 00:01:03.400
What's up?

20
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:04.733
There is a danger of imperial disaster in the palace

21
00:01:04.733 --> 00:01:05.533
Your Majesty has ordered

22
00:01:05.533 --> 00:01:07.466
The officials above the third rank will attack with you

23
00:01:07.466 --> 00:01:07.966
Negotiate and send

24
00:01:07.966 --> 00:01:08.866
Come with me to the palace quickly

25
00:01:09.266 --> 00:01:10.366
Let's go!

26
00:01:11.166 --> 00:01:13.500
Oh, oh, oh, I know, I know.

27
00:01:16.366 --> 00:01:17.166
Enter the palace quickly

28
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.466
The ministers of the ancient palace gather together

29
00:01:21.466 --> 00:01:25.200
Is there nothing you can do?

30
00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.466
Your Majesty, yellow disasters have been impossible to prevent since ancient times

31
00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.766
That's God's punishment

32
00:01:30.866 --> 00:01:31.966
It is inevitable

33
00:01:31.966 --> 00:01:35.000
With the sword of the old minister, Cao Ting prepares food

34
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.533
Ship to Guanzhong first

35
00:01:36.533 --> 00:01:38.666
Prepare for the worst

36
00:01:40.133 --> 00:01:41.833
Heaven punishment

37
00:01:41.933 --> 00:01:45.300
Did the Prime Minister say that after I ascended the throne?

38
00:01:45.366 --> 00:01:47.666
Heaven does not allow a woman to become an emperor

39
00:01:47.866 --> 00:01:51.633
Is that why I take this punishment as my retribution?

40
00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.200
I dare not

41
00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:57.400
Once the yellow disaster floods, hundreds of thousands of people in Guanzhong

42
00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:59.100
People must be struggling

43
00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.666
What's the best way to do it?

44
00:02:00.766 --> 00:02:02.166
Just say it.

45
00:02:02.166 --> 00:02:04.266
I will definitely reward

46
00:02:04.366 --> 00:02:07.700
Your Majesty, yellow disasters have been accompanied by rebellions since ancient times

47
00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:08.866
The old minister believes that

48
00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:11.800
Your Majesty deserves to be used for food

49
00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.666
Nanjing University seven guns cannot be touched

50
00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.233
Prevent too much rebellion

51
00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:16.300
Several wars

52
00:02:16.966 --> 00:02:19.400
Your Majesty, the emperor disaster is not yet an ambassador

53
00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.166
If the emperor directly sends a large army into Guanzhong

54
00:02:22.166 --> 00:02:23.500
Fear of backfiring

55
00:02:23.533 --> 00:02:25.800
What's more, when the army moves

56
00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.000
These two rings are also a small book

57
00:02:28.466 --> 00:02:30.766
It's better to struggle with all your strength

58
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.300
What Guo Aiqing said is

59
00:02:32.866 --> 00:02:34.833
Things haven't developed yet

60
00:02:35.166 --> 00:02:36.966
People who want to send troops to suppress

61
00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.533
Since this doesn't work the way the traffic police do

62
00:02:39.533 --> 00:02:42.000
May I ask Lord Mao if he can tell me?

63
00:02:42.133 --> 00:02:44.166
This official has no way

64
00:02:44.366 --> 00:02:47.566
But blindly the Zheng family is definitely a nonsense

65
00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:48.600
Friends of service

66
00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.466
You have a way, you say fart

67
00:02:50.466 --> 00:02:51.833
You say you say

68
00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.300
I told you there's no way to go through that

69
00:03:13.666 --> 00:03:14.766
obediently

70
00:03:25.066 --> 00:03:28.000
This is the dream of the crab spirit

71
00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.100
You are coming

72
00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:33.800
not come

73
00:03:34.366 --> 00:03:35.633
I let you come

74
00:03:35.766 --> 00:03:37.266
Here to discuss the solution

75
00:03:37.266 --> 00:03:39.033
It's not because you quarreled.

76
00:03:40.333 --> 00:03:42.833
What can Cui Xing and you do?

77
00:03:42.966 --> 00:03:46.433
Your Majesty, since ancient times, no one has been able to suppress royal disasters

78
00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:48.500
According to Liu Jun Shou

79
00:03:48.666 --> 00:03:50.400
This royal pet has appeared

80
00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.866
And the fertile fields are full of eggs

81
00:03:52.966 --> 00:03:55.833
These eggs go deep into the ground and are difficult to eradicate

82
00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.200
I'm afraid mother can only prepare

83
00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.866
Pair pair pair Cui Zhuangyuan Yuan Yuan rate

84
00:04:01.966 --> 00:04:03.200
This is a natural disaster

85
00:04:03.266 --> 00:04:06.300
It is impossible to argue with human resources alone

86
00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:08.366
Instant disaster relief

87
00:04:09.766 --> 00:04:11.100
So many disaster victims

88
00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:14.066
How can you survive only by relying on the imperial court disaster?
