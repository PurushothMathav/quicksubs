00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.000
Oh, Lord Cui

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.766
You are really a god

3
00:00:03.766 --> 00:00:05.166
In just two days

4
00:00:05.166 --> 00:00:08.133
You want two to 50 yuan a bucket?

5
00:00:08.133 --> 00:00:12.100
You really make the subordinate admire you.

6
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.300
But the people of Linjiang City are miserable

7
00:00:15.466 --> 00:00:17.266
Hey Cui Daren

8
00:00:17.566 --> 00:00:19.633
I don't know what happened.

9
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.400
Why are the people of Linjiang City miserable?

10
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.466
The Lamb, the grandson of the Duke of Ling, has just arrived in Linjiang City

11
00:00:25.466 --> 00:00:27.400
The first order issued was

12
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.733
Order the four good merchants in Linjiang City

13
00:00:29.733 --> 00:00:32.833
Grain must not be sold for less than 1.50 million a bucket

14
00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:33.966
What!

15
00:00:34.666 --> 00:00:37.133
One hundred and fifty bowls poured

16
00:00:37.133 --> 00:00:38.833
Ding Guogong's power is backwards

17
00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:40.266
Although the empress succeeds

18
00:00:40.266 --> 00:00:42.266
Daqian ushered in a new shuffle

19
00:00:42.266 --> 00:00:43.700
But anyway

20
00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:45.566
Duke Ding was the elder of the three dynasties

21
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.066
His prestige is unknown to thousands of people.

22
00:00:51.466 --> 00:00:54.366
But the lamb has the status of the grandson of the Duke of the Kingdom

23
00:00:54.366 --> 00:00:56.966
His status is much higher than mine

24
00:00:56.966 --> 00:00:59.000
He didn't release the prisoner

25
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.800
Forcing greedy merchants to cut prices

26
00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:01.633
On the contrary.

27
00:01:02.733 --> 00:01:04.400
It also helps to increase food prices

28
00:01:04.666 --> 00:01:07.033
What a pity, this great identity

29
00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.000
The Order of the Imperial History

30
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.833
Tell those young people not to be too greedy

31
00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:18.666
Make this imperial history angry

32
00:01:18.666 --> 00:01:21.100
They bear the consequences.

33
00:01:21.333 --> 00:01:22.900
Grain prices in Qingshui River

34
00:01:23.366 --> 00:01:24.900
Another 8 cents must be dropped

35
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.000
82 points they still earn

36
00:01:28.166 --> 00:01:29.866
Enough is enough.

37
00:01:31.133 --> 00:01:33.800
If you give me face

38
00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.766
After this imperial history returned to Chang'an

39
00:01:36.766 --> 00:01:39.566
He became the central servant in front of His Majesty

40
00:01:40.333 --> 00:01:42.700
This sentiment is based on the conductor

41
00:01:43.466 --> 00:01:44.766
If not

42
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.466
I'm afraid the consequences are not something they can afford

43
00:01:49.866 --> 00:01:52.833
Mr. Cui means that he can drop another 8 cents.

44
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.466
Grain prices in Qingshui River

45
00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.133
Ben Yu is secretly investigating Yanagita's two great families

46
00:01:58.133 --> 00:02:01.966
They are all recommended at the price of 53-70 words respectively.

47
00:02:02.133 --> 00:02:05.366
Besides, they still have Chen Liang from last year in their library

48
00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.133
83 text will not cause them to die

49
00:02:08.133 --> 00:02:11.500
Online onlookers one foot at a time

50
00:02:11.933 --> 00:02:14.366
Give a stick to a sweet date

51
00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.200
That's the way to be an official

52
00:02:17.366 --> 00:02:18.966
Cui Jade Large Materials

53
00:02:18.966 --> 00:02:22.600
This official represents Qingshui City 50,000 many people

54
00:02:22.766 --> 00:02:24.900
Thank you Cui Yushi

55
00:02:24.933 --> 00:02:28.566
Have the blessing of Cui Yu Shinai Jiangshan Design

56
00:02:31.533 --> 00:02:32.800
Lamb, lamb

57
00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.533
How can you be a waste against this champion?

58
00:02:35.533 --> 00:02:37.966
It's up to you to die
