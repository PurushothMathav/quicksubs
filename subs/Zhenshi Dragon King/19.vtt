00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:02.366
Strange

2
00:00:02.366 --> 00:00:04.100
Why is my bone gone?

3
00:00:04.166 --> 00:00:06.433
How can I ask for a consultation fee for him?

4
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.833
Can Doctor Fang treat my father's illness?

5
00:00:08.933 --> 00:00:10.466
What a disease!

6
00:00:10.466 --> 00:00:12.266
The old man's hands are upside down

7
00:00:13.466 --> 00:00:17.300
Give him the 9 Quasi-Gangster Pills refined by the old man

8
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.033
It won't take a while

9
00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:20.466
Will wake up

10
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:24.400
Dad?

11
00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:27.866
Dad, you're awake

12
00:00:30.366 --> 00:00:32.100
Dad, how are you feeling?

13
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:33.700
Dad feels now

14
00:00:34.366 --> 00:00:36.000
refreshed

15
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.566
It's all right.

16
00:00:37.666 --> 00:00:38.733
Thank you Doctor Fang

17
00:00:38.733 --> 00:00:39.800
Thank you, Master Yu

18
00:00:39.933 --> 00:00:41.500
Fang Shenyi's medicine cured the disease

19
00:00:41.666 --> 00:00:44.300
It's just that Watteau is not worth mentioning in life

20
00:00:45.966 --> 00:00:47.633
Sure enough, it's a citizen fishing generation

21
00:00:47.966 --> 00:00:48.900
Uncle recovered

22
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:50.800
Is it related to you?

23
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.400
Strange.

24
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.300
The patient woke up is not the reason why I got sick

25
00:00:56.533 --> 00:00:58.600
Is it because of you?

26
00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.200
Doctor Fang, you are the uncle he cured

27
00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:03.666
Give him all the credit

28
00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:05.366
Are you satisfied?

29
00:01:05.366 --> 00:01:07.000
Chu Tao is enough

30
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.866
My dad is seriously ill and needs to rest for the first time

31
00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:10.166
To quarrel out

32
00:01:11.733 --> 00:01:14.366
Chu Tao, this is Dad

33
00:01:14.366 --> 00:01:15.366
This is Luming.

34
00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.100
Ah, come on.

35
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.800
It's all about healing me

36
00:01:19.333 --> 00:01:21.433
Lu Ming has an engagement with you

37
00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.033
It's inevitable to want to show yourself

38
00:01:25.166 --> 00:01:27.400
Don't be so fussy

39
00:01:28.866 --> 00:01:30.800
Thank you to Dr. Yu Shao and Dr. Fang

40
00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:33.100
I was discharged from the hospital today.

41
00:01:33.733 --> 00:01:37.066
Take the two juniors back to do some personal business

42
00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.100
Give gifts and thanks in person another day
