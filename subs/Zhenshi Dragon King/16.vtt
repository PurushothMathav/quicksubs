00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:05.800
Doctor, how is my dad?

2
00:00:05.866 --> 00:00:08.266
Your dad is very sick

3
00:00:08.266 --> 00:00:10.900
There's nothing left to do. Prepare for the funeral

4
00:00:11.166 --> 00:00:12.766
Ah dad

5
00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:15.466
Doctor I beg you

6
00:00:15.466 --> 00:00:16.566
Please help me

7
00:00:16.566 --> 00:00:17.900
There's nothing I can do.

8
00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:18.700
To save your dad

9
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.966
Only by finding the pulp of the ginkgo of the living dead

10
00:00:20.966 --> 00:00:22.833
Only then can Doctor Fang come back to life

11
00:00:22.966 --> 00:00:26.100
Doctor Fang's father had asked him for treatment once before

12
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.566
Then help me invite him over

13
00:00:27.566 --> 00:00:29.566
Miss Li, it's not that I won't help you.

14
00:00:29.566 --> 00:00:31.700
It's just Doctor Fang, he's elusive

15
00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:32.766
elusive

16
00:00:32.766 --> 00:00:34.200
Can't find him at all

17
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.000
Even if I find a pillow towel that doesn't impress him

18
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.866
He's not going to help.

19
00:00:42.866 --> 00:00:45.200
Don't worry, I can cure my uncle's illness.

20
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.366
Where did the madman come from?

21
00:00:47.366 --> 00:00:48.700
You can still heal

22
00:00:48.866 --> 00:00:50.766
When are you still talking big?

23
00:00:50.766 --> 00:00:51.766
Don't worry.

24
00:00:52.266 --> 00:00:53.800
Even if you come back to life

25
00:00:54.133 --> 00:00:55.200
Not a problem

26
00:00:55.566 --> 00:00:57.333
Cure your neuropathy first

27
00:00:57.333 --> 00:00:58.533
It's whimsical

28
00:00:58.533 --> 00:01:00.166
Dr. Wang is right

29
00:01:00.266 --> 00:01:02.566
People like you are whimsical

30
00:01:02.866 --> 00:01:04.566
Chuda long time no see
