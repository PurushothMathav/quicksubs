00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:02.800
Mr. Lu also asked Fang 11 to save my father's life

2
00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:04.500
Fang Ruo gives you a chance to atone for your sins

3
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:05.700
You can let go of the past.

4
00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:06.833
But I want to understand

5
00:00:06.933 --> 00:00:08.033
I want to understand

6
00:00:23.333 --> 00:00:25.333
Miss Xu, your father's illness has been cured

7
00:00:25.333 --> 00:00:26.366
Will wake up soon

8
00:00:26.366 --> 00:00:29.200
Later, I will prescribe a pair of medicine to fix the root and peiyuan

9
00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.700
Just give your father three days. Okay.

10
00:00:31.866 --> 00:00:33.066
Thank you Fang Chen Doctor

11
00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:34.733
This is 1 million pillow towel you take

12
00:00:34.733 --> 00:00:36.200
But I'll pick it up again.

13
00:00:39.733 --> 00:00:41.466
I didn't get a penny for this visit.

14
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.466
Miss Xu should take it back

15
00:00:44.466 --> 00:00:46.733
Fang Shiyi, how do you want my Xu family to thank you?

16
00:00:46.733 --> 00:00:48.100
This is for Mr. Lu

17
00:00:48.166 --> 00:00:49.400
It's Lao Jiu's pleasure.

18
00:00:49.533 --> 00:00:52.166
Thank you, Mr. Lu

19
00:00:52.266 --> 00:00:53.866
No, retire first

20
00:00:53.933 --> 00:00:55.300
Retire first

21
00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.200
Lu Ming didn't expect you to be the official Dragon King

22
00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:03.100
Then why do you still go to the Li family as a pendant?

23
00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:05.866
In fact, I have been engaged to the court for a long time

24
00:01:05.866 --> 00:01:08.633
And his brother died in revenge for my divorce

25
00:01:09.166 --> 00:01:10.266
I can't let him down

26
00:01:10.266 --> 00:01:12.033
I didn't let you run away

27
00:01:12.066 --> 00:01:13.800
Now any man with a little ability

28
00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.166
Which one is not the red flag at home?

29
00:01:15.166 --> 00:01:16.400
Bunting flags fluttering outside

30
00:01:16.466 --> 00:01:17.966
Only your elm head

31
00:01:18.333 --> 00:01:20.633
But thank you all the same. I'll take you out to dinner.

32
00:01:25.666 --> 00:01:26.800
What is he doing here?
