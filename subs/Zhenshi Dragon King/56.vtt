00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.466
Neuropathy, do you know how many zeros there are in 10 million?

2
00:00:03.466 --> 00:00:04.566
That's not your mouth

3
00:00:04.566 --> 00:00:06.000
You can take it out when you touch it up and down.

4
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.766
Whether or not I can take it out is my business

5
00:00:07.766 --> 00:00:09.900
If you want to follow the price, you can probably climb it.

6
00:00:09.966 --> 00:00:12.433
Do you have the qualifications to compare wealth with me?

7
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.566
20 million a billion

8
00:00:15.066 --> 00:00:17.066
This one-sided is worth up to 30 million

9
00:00:17.066 --> 00:00:19.000
Is he crazy to dare to call 100 million?

10
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:20.766
It seems inevitable

11
00:00:20.766 --> 00:00:22.266
That's a lot of money.

12
00:00:22.933 --> 00:00:24.266
Not crazy you

13
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:26.366
Keep it.

14
00:00:26.366 --> 00:00:27.633
I'll give it to you.

15
00:00:27.666 --> 00:00:29.500
I'm polite, how can I take out this billion?

16
00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.566
It seems that you don't really want to be busy.

17
00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:33.166
Dumin, what are you trying to do?

18
00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:34.466
Where did you get so much money?

19
00:00:34.466 --> 00:00:35.733
I'm like the whole Li family

20
00:00:35.733 --> 00:00:36.966
I can't come up with 100 million

21
00:00:36.966 --> 00:00:37.900
Come out with confidence

22
00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:39.000
Money is not a problem

23
00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:40.600
One billion times

24
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.233
One hundred million twice

25
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.800
One hundred million three transactions

26
00:00:46.466 --> 00:00:49.033
The problem is no money

27
00:00:49.166 --> 00:00:50.966
Who says Mr. Lu has no money?

28
00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.700
My money from the Jiangnan Chamber of Commerce

29
00:00:58.966 --> 00:01:00.566
It's Mr. Lu's money

30
00:01:01.066 --> 00:01:03.100
This guy really has a problem

31
00:01:03.166 --> 00:01:04.633
Same as I thought.

32
00:01:04.766 --> 00:01:06.433
What's up with this guy?

33
00:01:06.466 --> 00:01:07.100
In the future, we can

34
00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.200
Shen Zhiqiu, the richest man in Jiangnan, paid for him

35
00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.600
Looks like a boss

36
00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.400
Yu Jiao, this kid actually robbed a woman with this kind of boss

37
00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.100
I really don't know the sky and earth

38
00:01:19.666 --> 00:01:21.800
I received it and took a picture for you.

39
00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:22.666
It's not safe here

40
00:01:22.666 --> 00:01:23.633
You go home
