1
00:00:00.966 --> 00:00:03.133
I am the Dragon King

2
00:00:03.133 --> 00:00:04.100
Win like a minister

3
00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:05.133
Vega Four Seas

4
00:00:05.133 --> 00:00:06.133
National Fate Dragon

5
00:00:06.133 --> 00:00:08.566
And I, Zhang Long, am not worthy of the position

6
00:00:08.566 --> 00:00:09.866
How dare you steal your life

7
00:00:09.866 --> 00:00:11.266
If it weren't for my self-awareness

8
00:00:11.266 --> 00:00:12.733
Don't dare to imagine replacing it

9
00:00:12.733 --> 00:00:15.066
Otherwise, you and I are both sinners of the Dragon Kingdom

10
00:00:15.066 --> 00:00:15.900
How could this be?

11
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.166
You promised me.

12
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:19.800
I promise you to fight your absurdity

13
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.533
I didn't promise you the title of Dragon King

14
00:00:21.533 --> 00:00:23.033
Do it yourself

15
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.366
Examined my king

16
00:00:27.533 --> 00:00:28.833
unparalleled honor

17
00:00:28.966 --> 00:00:30.666
The king actually refused to succeed

18
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.466
I plead for the people

19
00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:33.966
Did I do something wrong?

20
00:00:33.966 --> 00:00:35.500
Sir, you are right

21
00:00:35.566 --> 00:00:36.700
It's all your fault

22
00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:38.200
If he hadn't made a big fuss about the dragon feast

23
00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:39.500
Will not anger the king

24
00:00:39.533 --> 00:00:40.766
I'll kill you!

25
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.600
Obsessed with unenlightened slaves, stop talking

26
00:00:44.766 --> 00:00:45.700
Lord War God

27
00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:46.500
We come today

28
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:46.733
Really?

29
00:00:46.733 --> 00:00:49.066
Just to thank the Mad Dragon King for saving his life

30
00:00:49.166 --> 00:00:50.500
Unintentional to disturb the Tenglong smoke

31
00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:51.966
Please forgive me, Lord War God

32
00:00:51.966 --> 00:00:53.566
It doesn't hurt, you are confused.

33
00:00:53.866 --> 00:00:56.233
Even now, you're still defending this psychopath

34
00:00:56.466 --> 00:00:58.666
Lord Tianwang originally promised well

35
00:00:58.666 --> 00:00:59.900
Why did you suddenly change your mind?

36
00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:01.500
Also splitting waves in public

37
00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.333
It must be because this lunatic has ulterior motives

38
00:01:04.333 --> 00:01:06.500
Do whatever you want at the Dragon Feast

39
00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:07.566
Angry Lord Tianwang

40
00:01:07.566 --> 00:01:08.700
Please order

41
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.966
I will slay this thief by the sword
