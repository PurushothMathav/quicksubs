00:00:00.466 --> 00:00:01.466
You let my son go first

2
00:00:01.466 --> 00:00:03.900
I promise you anything, I can't get up now

3
00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:06.833
late

4
00:00:07.766 --> 00:00:09.366
Lens lens

5
00:00:09.533 --> 00:00:11.500
How dare you kill my son?

6
00:00:11.566 --> 00:00:14.600
I'm going to shred you to pieces for me

7
00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.066
Hahaha kid

8
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:33.166
Where are you from?

9
00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:35.100
I have no grudge against you in the past, no grudge today

10
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.500
My son was killed by you, what do you want?

11
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.933
Remember the 800 warriors who died tragically outside the Great Wall?

12
00:00:39.933 --> 00:00:41.533
What are you saying?

13
00:00:41.533 --> 00:00:43.633
I don't know. I remember

14
00:00:43.933 --> 00:00:46.833
Then let me help you remember it.

15
00:00:47.866 --> 00:00:48.666
They

16
00:00:49.366 --> 00:00:50.900
Is to die for the country

17
00:00:50.933 --> 00:00:53.000
Everyone who lives on

18
00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.500
But because of traitors like you

19
00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:57.500
Tragic death

20
00:00:57.533 --> 00:00:59.500
Boy, you have the guts to kill me
