00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:02.000
Okay, if you want it so much

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.133
I'll take a picture for you.

3
00:00:03.133 --> 00:00:04.466
Go home immediately after the photo is taken

4
00:00:04.466 --> 00:00:05.766
Don't worry about the auction

5
00:00:05.766 --> 00:00:06.866
I'll handle it myself.

6
00:00:06.866 --> 00:00:08.966
As long as you don't give me a fool, I'll burn high incense

7
00:00:08.966 --> 00:00:09.900
Crazy

8
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.566
You think the auction is a play house

9
00:00:11.566 --> 00:00:12.500
You have the final say

10
00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:14.600
At the auction

11
00:00:14.733 --> 00:00:16.666
Everything is of high value

12
00:00:19.766 --> 00:00:22.600
Thank you all for coming to the charity auction today

13
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.400
Let's cut to the chase.

14
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.433
Start today's auction

15
00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.100
Now we have the first lot of the day

16
00:00:31.266 --> 00:00:34.600
Country V unilateral starting price 5 million

17
00:00:35.066 --> 00:00:37.000
You dare to bid for grapes

18
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.566
Don't worry, there's still me

19
00:00:38.566 --> 00:00:41.266
It's called Yusheng Luming, but it's here

20
00:00:41.266 --> 00:00:43.800
You're not giving him face by saying that

21
00:00:44.866 --> 00:00:46.200
What if he is here?

22
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.766
Can he still help me take a picture of Gu Wu Danfang?

23
00:00:48.766 --> 00:00:50.566
What is rubbish Guwu Danfang?

24
00:00:50.566 --> 00:00:52.500
As long as you get what Tang wants

25
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.233
Even the stars in the sky

26
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:55.466
I can take it off too

27
00:00:55.466 --> 00:00:57.866
6 million 8 million 10 million

28
00:01:02.066 --> 00:01:03.200
Crazy I only have 8 million

29
00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.100
Didn't you embarrass me by calling 10 million?
