00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.890
If I hadn't taken action. You have long since become a fool.

2
00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:06.420
No one came to treat me. That's the attitude you have.

3
00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:09.510
No one came. My enemy is indeed yours.

4
00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:11.890
You heard something is wrong with being too talkative,

5
00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:14.720
Sorry for you. Let me ask you, is it a moon eye?

6
00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:18.720
You might know something. Who took it off?

7
00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:22.110
Me. Native,

8
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.180
Your clothes. I drank it. I drank it.

9
00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.920
I drank it. I drank it. I drank it. I drank it. I drank it. I drank it.

10
00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:27.540
I drank it. I drank it. I drank it. I drank it. I drank it. I drank it. I drank it. I drank it. I drank it. I drank it. I drank it. I drank it. I drank it. I drank it. I drank it. I drank it. I drank it. I drank it. I

11
00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:30.910
Drink. I drank it. I drank it. I drank it. I drank it.

12
00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:33.120
I drank it. Unchained

13
00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.180
There is constant happiness inside

14
00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:36.590
But the table looks

15
00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:39.240
You seem to have changed

16
00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:40.790
It’s a catastrophic experience

17
00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:42.140
You're such a big team member

18
00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:42.900
Even if it costs money

19
00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:45.690
What happened to Yueqi?

20
00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.130
I'm on the Yellow Wall Viri

21
00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:48.230
I accidentally suffered it once

22
00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:49.890
But the injury is not fascinating

23
00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:50.940
The wound lost for a while

24
00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:52.950
There's no way I can fight with him.

25
00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:54.010
meeting and works

26
00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:56.300
Staying together is not great

27
00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:57.420
I just didn't do it again

28
00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:58.680
Yesterday you had a seizure

29
00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:00.100
They all chose mobile phones

30
00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:01.650
The whole task is relatively speaking

31
00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.230
Do not exchange happy wounds

32
00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:04.349
Already achieved too much

33
00:01:04.349 --> 00:01:05.590
You will be less and less likely to survive

34
00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:07.040
So hard too

35
00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:10.900
Only then can I discover him. It’s hard to know him by chance.

36
00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:12.260
I don’t want to do anything for you just now

37
00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:13.640
Your house price will be his
