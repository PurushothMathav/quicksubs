1
00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:02.790
father emperor

2
00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:04.770
The lost prince has a special relationship

3
00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:06.410
Feeling sick and surrendering

4
00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:09.010
We turned back from the attack on Chuyue without any gifts.

5
00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:10.990
No courtesy to you, the peace warrior. It’s suitable for rest.

6
00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:13.010
We just took one more level

7
00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:14.510
I heard there's an announcement here

8
00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:15.310
Overtaken again

9
00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.980
Princess, please give me a reward in return.

10
00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:27.510
No matter what you say, I can't prove that you are one of a kind.

11
00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:31.840
This princess hasn't even paid back the certificate. Who knows where you got it from?

12
00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:34.990
If you don’t believe it, it’s a long way to go. You can explain it.

13
00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:37.340
Cai Fan, it’s true that the traces you stepped on are still very new.

14
00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:38.620
You can match him

15
00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:42.760
The emperor can't help them

16
00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.540
No one comes near Li Yuegong

17
00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:48.530
Prince Li is the most suspected

18
00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:50.040
The jade beads are looking for blessings

19
00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:51.560
How did you get in and out of the Moon Palace?

20
00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:54.320
I'm afraid I avoided it on purpose by being too small a kilometer away.

21
00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:55.560
what does this mean

22
00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:58.440
Although there are real traces at the scene

23
00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:00.200
But it was the murderer who punished

24
00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:01.020
real real

25
00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:02.550
Such a scene will never happen

26
00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.099
It shows that the murderer is familiar to Yuzhu

27
00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:07.500
Maybe Yu Zhuxunzhu will let others go

28
00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:18.760
It’s just for the sake of time. I don’t want it.

29
00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:21.870
Mine are all reasonable

30
00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:24.910
Don't catch the murderer

31
00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.800
The emperor suffers

32
00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.160
The chief news officer is really adorable.

33
00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:37.820
You must be heard by the Lord

34
00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:39.380
Run for justice

35
00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:45.200
Why don't you take a look at it?

36
00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:46.800
The affairs of Zhu Jingzhu

37
00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:49.350
what do you want to do

38
00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:51.850
The main news is dead

39
00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:53.390
This one was robbed and sent to harm

40
00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:55.510
Do you still want to live without him?

41
00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:57.280
Don't forget to misunderstand

42
00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:59.260
I think

43
00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.540
Lord Yuzhu may not be dead yet, so what?
