00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:01.940
I look at that wound,

2
00:00:01.940 --> 00:00:03.620
The high injury this time came from too many people,

3
00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:05.790
If she wanted to find the boarding officer, she thought about it,

4
00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:09.930
Could you please spend some money on remittance?

5
00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:11.610
The black wound original leader has a total of men and women,

6
00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:13.750
Uniform, Uncle Wang,

7
00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:15.950
Everyone in Nanguangli is from behind, just talking about doing something.

8
00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:23.670
What's going on? The prince's wounds should have been healed long ago.

9
00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:28.880
Wounds cost thousands of dollars, how wonderful,

10
00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:30.730
Bring me a knife, a clean one,

11
00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:32.900
Now the volcano is red, and then it is boiled with waste water.

12
00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:35.500
The prince is talking nonsense. It’s okay. Go quickly.

13
00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.480
I read this correctly. That introduction was poisonous.

14
00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.780
If it's poisonous, it's impossible that Mr. Meng wouldn't be able to detect it.

15
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.650
What if they don’t all need poison?

16
00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.780
What do you mean, want

17
00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:54.500
these three minutes

18
00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:55.820
Maybe something like that

19
00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:57.020
a drug every time

20
00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:00.400
