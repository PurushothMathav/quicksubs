1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.420
what's going on

2
00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:04.130
It was fine just now

3
00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:05.290
Why did you suddenly get into trouble?

4
00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.410
It was okay, but Shi Huangzi had difficulty breathing.

5
00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:11.340
Face light purple

6
00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.860
It seems to be a poisoning battle

7
00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.600
How could it be possible to be poisoned?

8
00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.440
This is too mediocre food

9
00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:20.860
But they were all poisoned

10
00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.980
When Cheng Shi Huangzi took detoxification soup, everything came out of Shi Huangzi

11
00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:31.810
What does not mean

12
00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:34.140
The matter about leaving the palace has not disappeared

13
00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.180
Something happened to Huangzi again

14
00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:39.000
Empress, empress, empress, empress, empress, empress, empress

15
00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.240
Prince Chi's children's comic is very fast

16
00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:45.180
I'm afraid it's too late to send the antidote.

17
00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:48.160
Now we can only find the murderer

18
00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:49.900
Let the murderer call out the antidote

19
00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:51.500
Only then can Prince Chi be saved

20
00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:56.130
Maybe with Prince Chi

21
00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:58.270
Someone comes and sends someone to defraud the store.

22
00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:59.510
No one is allowed in or out

23
00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:01.680
You must find it for me

24
00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.380
Which foods are the problem?

25
00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:11.460
queen empress

26
00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.880
These foods are very safe

27
00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:16.130
Has Prince Chi ever eaten it?

28
00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.810
Something else?

29
00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:22.930
The teacher you have been looking after

30
00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:24.690
Have you ever seen what he ate?
