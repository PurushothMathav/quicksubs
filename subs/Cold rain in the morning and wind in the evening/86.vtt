00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:07.433
How're things going?

2
00:00:07.966 --> 00:00:09.266
Which thing do you mean?

3
00:00:10.533 --> 00:00:13.166
Brother Gu kills or murders to raise me

4
00:00:15.966 --> 00:00:18.233
Lin Niannian, you didn't die

5
00:00:18.333 --> 00:00:19.366
Are you disappointed?

6
00:00:19.366 --> 00:00:22.466
Fortunately, my mother protected me at the last minute yesterday.

7
00:00:22.466 --> 00:00:24.900
He didn't come to see you last night.

8
00:00:26.533 --> 00:00:27.733
He last night

9
00:00:27.733 --> 00:00:29.833
I've been risking my fists to search for your whereabouts

10
00:00:30.533 --> 00:00:33.266
How can I have time to take care of my adopted daughter?

11
00:00:33.266 --> 00:00:34.900
I'm not talking about my mom.

12
00:00:35.133 --> 00:00:37.266
Is our common mother

13
00:00:38.533 --> 00:00:39.333
forest

14
00:00:39.566 --> 00:00:40.400
red

15
00:00:42.366 --> 00:00:43.666
What are you talking about?

16
00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:45.400
Yuan Hong is dead

17
00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:46.966
He's already dead.

18
00:00:48.366 --> 00:00:50.000
Even if you beat me

19
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.566
Don't lie to me with this cow

20
00:00:54.266 --> 00:00:56.666
Xueqin didn't lie to you.

21
00:00:56.666 --> 00:00:59.166
Maybe it's fate, maybe it's coincidence

22
00:00:59.166 --> 00:01:00.933
But no matter how uprooted

23
00:01:00.933 --> 00:01:03.166
A mother's love is the most sincere in the world

24
00:01:03.166 --> 00:01:04.633
The most selfless love

25
00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.800
Xueqing, I have arranged a ward for you.

26
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.766
You won't be in any danger from now on

27
00:01:12.133 --> 00:01:14.666
Of course there is no freedom

28
00:01:15.966 --> 00:01:17.300
I see.

29
00:01:18.133 --> 00:01:20.033
Can I have another drink?

30
00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:44.300
If he hadn't asked me to swap with you 20 years ago

31
00:01:44.466 --> 00:01:48.200
Perhaps I would have died of a heart attack long ago.

32
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.066
I'm the one who took your life away

33
00:01:56.566 --> 00:01:57.600
Twilight!

34
00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:59.666
From simple to extravagant

35
00:02:00.566 --> 00:02:02.100
From luxury to solve problems

36
00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.666
Compared with the identity of ordinary people, it takes a lifetime

37
00:02:07.066 --> 00:02:09.866
I can leave behind the identity of a daughter

38
00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:12.466
Go to my biological mother

39
00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:25.400
xueqing

40
00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.366
xueqing

41
00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.566
Why are you

42
00:02:31.533 --> 00:02:32.466
xueqing

43
00:02:33.266 --> 00:02:35.300
Even if you want to hurt me

44
00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.766
I still treat you like my own daughter

45
00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.633
Why can't you think about it?

46
00:02:44.766 --> 00:02:45.700
Mom

47
00:02:46.866 --> 00:02:49.633
Today is the last time I will call you that

48
00:02:52.766 --> 00:02:54.200
After I'm gone

49
00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:55.566
You and Nian Nian

50
00:02:56.166 --> 00:02:58.433
There will be no barrier between you

51
00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:04.200
xueqing

52
00:03:05.166 --> 00:03:06.000
xueqing

53
00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.866
Xueqing, wake up
