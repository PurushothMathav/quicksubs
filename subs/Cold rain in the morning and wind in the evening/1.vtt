00:00:03.166 --> 00:00:04.233
Doctor

2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.266
Please save the child

3
00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:08.666
Help me

4
00:00:08.933 --> 00:00:10.100
You get up first

5
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:15.833
The child was born with a heart condition

6
00:00:16.866 --> 00:00:19.166
Don't you have a family history? No

7
00:00:19.333 --> 00:00:22.033
The baby was fine when it was first born

8
00:00:22.333 --> 00:00:24.000
How did you do this?

9
00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.633
Police please

10
00:00:26.666 --> 00:00:28.166
Save my child

11
00:00:28.166 --> 00:00:30.733
I'll give you an answer, don't worry.

12
00:00:30.733 --> 00:00:33.166
Don't worry, we will do our best to treat you.

13
00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:34.500
You need to rest now.

14
00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.833
Mrs. Shi has postpartum hemorrhage

15
00:00:36.866 --> 00:00:38.666
The dean wants you to rush to the operating room immediately

16
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.300
But the doctor

17
00:00:40.966 --> 00:00:42.500
Save my child

18
00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.966
Save my child

19
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.766
Xiao Zheng, you are still here in silence

20
00:00:48.866 --> 00:00:50.066
Go to the operating room

21
00:00:50.066 --> 00:00:53.066
But this doctor saved my child

22
00:00:53.066 --> 00:00:54.833
The child of such an inferior person

23
00:00:54.933 --> 00:00:56.700
How can it compare to Mrs. Ye's comfort?

24
00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:58.300
Go to the doctor

25
00:00:58.966 --> 00:01:01.666
Arrange a doctor for Blackie. Doctor?

26
00:01:02.366 --> 00:01:06.000
My child doctor

27
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.500
Save my son

28
00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.766
The doctor saved my child

29
00:01:11.333 --> 00:01:13.000
Save my child

30
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.533
I beg you.

31
00:01:14.533 --> 00:01:18.100
Save my child

32
00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.266
The eldest lady slept so soundly

33
00:01:26.466 --> 00:01:28.300
I just ask Mrs. Ye to get through this difficult time

34
00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:29.833
I can also get a red envelope.

35
00:01:41.133 --> 00:01:41.966
daughter

36
00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.300
Mom, I

37
00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:46.366
Can't save you

38
00:01:46.733 --> 00:01:49.633
It can only be exchanged with the rich daughter

39
00:01:51.466 --> 00:01:53.066
This is mom.

40
00:01:53.466 --> 00:01:57.300
The only way I can think of to save you

41
00:01:59.466 --> 00:02:00.933
What a pomp.

42
00:02:00.933 --> 00:02:02.800
Mr. Ye is worthy of being the president of Luoshen Group

43
00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:04.400
What about the head designer?

44
00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.733
I heard that when Miss Luo was born

45
00:02:06.733 --> 00:02:07.900
Breathe 100,000 right

46
00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:09.433
But the right one can't get in

47
00:02:09.533 --> 00:02:11.200
The front door is a ghost mill

48
00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.133
All the experts in Jiangsu came for consultation

49
00:02:13.133 --> 00:02:14.600
It's the first time I've seen you.

50
00:02:45.466 --> 00:02:47.566
Madam, this is the new nanny
