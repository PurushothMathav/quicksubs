00:00:17.966 --> 00:00:19.500
This thousand lights

2
00:00:19.566 --> 00:00:22.233
There is no light shining for me

3
00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:30.033
That would be fine.

4
00:00:30.166 --> 00:00:33.100
I can do it, no worries, with a lucifer

5
00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:34.500
Went to see mom

6
00:00:41.566 --> 00:00:44.266
Miss Xueqin's mother

7
00:00:44.266 --> 00:00:44.933
Please help me

8
00:00:44.933 --> 00:00:46.066
I don't want to die.

9
00:00:46.733 --> 00:00:47.800
Mrs. Ye

10
00:00:48.533 --> 00:00:51.566
Roxelle is not your biological daughter

11
00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:56.166
What's the point of saving him?

12
00:00:56.666 --> 00:00:59.066
Every year I know you blame me

13
00:00:59.133 --> 00:01:01.166
Although Xueqing is not my biological child

14
00:01:01.166 --> 00:01:03.566
But he is the child I have raised for 20 years

15
00:01:03.566 --> 00:01:05.600
If you have something to release

16
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.133
Please give me a chance.

17
00:01:07.133 --> 00:01:08.800
I will make it up to you.

18
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.566
I want my mom back

19
00:01:12.533 --> 00:01:13.600
Is that okay?

20
00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:16.100
miss

21
00:01:16.566 --> 00:01:18.266
The dead cannot come back to life

22
00:01:18.366 --> 00:01:19.966
I know he raised you for 20 years

23
00:01:19.966 --> 00:01:21.900
But what

24
00:01:22.566 --> 00:01:26.100
Before my mother died, she wanted to meet her own daughter

25
00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.366
Is he wrong?

26
00:01:27.366 --> 00:01:30.733
That's right, but Xu Qing didn't know about it.

27
00:01:30.733 --> 00:01:32.166
He is innocent.

28
00:01:32.866 --> 00:01:34.033
He is innocent

29
00:01:34.266 --> 00:01:37.466
He grew up making my mom pick up dirty food from the ground and eat it

30
00:01:37.466 --> 00:01:38.833
You said he was innocent

31
00:01:40.133 --> 00:01:41.800
I was wrong

32
00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:42.866
I apologize to you.

33
00:01:42.866 --> 00:01:44.166
I beg you to let me go

34
00:01:44.166 --> 00:01:45.600
I don't want to die.

35
00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:46.533
As long as you let me go

36
00:01:46.533 --> 00:01:48.200
I can give you a lot of money.

37
00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.533
I'll give you anything you want I beg you

38
00:01:50.533 --> 00:01:51.900
I don't want to die.

39
00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:53.366
Mom

40
00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.100
Every year it's all my fault

41
00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.033
It's all my fault for being too indulgent with him

42
00:01:59.466 --> 00:02:01.400
Blame me for being too indifferent to divorce

43
00:02:01.933 --> 00:02:04.500
If you have anything to vent, come to me

44
00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.500
Please let Xuan Qing go, okay?

45
00:02:10.533 --> 00:02:12.200
You can also let go of the falling snow.

46
00:02:13.333 --> 00:02:16.300
After all, I promised my mom I wouldn't hurt her

47
00:02:17.466 --> 00:02:18.800
If I want you

48
00:02:19.966 --> 00:02:21.233
Kneel down for me
