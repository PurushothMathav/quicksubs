00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:18.066
How are you waking up?

2
00:00:18.066 --> 00:00:19.800
Is there any discomfort?

3
00:00:22.366 --> 00:00:23.766
I always ask you out

4
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:24.966
Miss you

5
00:00:25.533 --> 00:00:27.566
I know you're still blaming me

6
00:00:27.566 --> 00:00:28.600
It's my fault

7
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.066
I don't have a mother like you

8
00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:32.566
go out

9
00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.100
I know you won't forgive me easily

10
00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:38.800
But don't do anything stupid.

11
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.166
I don't even want to coax

12
00:00:42.666 --> 00:00:45.266
I want to hear my mom's name from you

13
00:00:46.333 --> 00:00:47.566
What's your trouble?

14
00:00:47.766 --> 00:00:49.600
Hey auntie

15
00:00:49.866 --> 00:00:53.266
Auntie Nian Nian is still very weak

16
00:00:53.266 --> 00:00:55.066
You can't be too emotional

17
00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:56.800
Why don't you go back and rest first?

18
00:00:57.366 --> 00:00:59.166
Ah ok ok

19
00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:01.700
Then you have a good rest

20
00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:03.466
I'll see you tomorrow.

21
00:01:44.533 --> 00:01:46.500
Mr. Ye's car is ready
