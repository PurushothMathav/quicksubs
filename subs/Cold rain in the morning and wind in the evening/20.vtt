1
00:00:01.333 --> 00:00:03.633
How can you defy my secret?

2
00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:06.766
Be careful, I'll ask HR to fire you now

3
00:00:06.766 --> 00:00:09.400
Only designs submitted through Roselle Group

4
00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:11.966
In order to receive the attention of the design competition organizing committee

5
00:00:11.966 --> 00:00:13.400
For mom's medical expenses

6
00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.166
I can't leave Roselle

7
00:00:15.166 --> 00:00:17.200
Ok, I'll clean it up.

8
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.600
Mr. Ye is good, Mr. Ye

9
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:23.466
This is the design department.

10
00:00:23.466 --> 00:00:25.366
All entries participating in this competition

11
00:00:25.366 --> 00:00:26.866
To ensure the fairness of citizens

12
00:00:26.866 --> 00:00:29.200
The names of all works have been sealed

13
00:00:30.466 --> 00:00:33.200
This is the work submitted by your design department

14
00:00:33.266 --> 00:00:34.500
What rubbish?

15
00:00:34.933 --> 00:00:36.600
I open Roselle Group

16
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.000
There's no need for a design department.

17
00:00:44.566 --> 00:00:47.000
This one is cleverly conceived

18
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.433
profound foundation

19
00:00:50.466 --> 00:00:51.700
Snowy

20
00:00:52.933 --> 00:00:54.666
As expected of the eldest lady

21
00:00:54.666 --> 00:00:56.800
Inherited your talent, Mr. Ye?

22
00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.766
Missy Cymbidium

23
00:00:58.766 --> 00:00:59.733
Snow Smart

24
00:00:59.733 --> 00:01:01.500
With the style of Mr. Ye back then?

25
00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.266
Okay, stop slapping horses there

26
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.200
You go and call Xueqing over

27
00:01:12.866 --> 00:01:14.933
I didn't expect our Roselle Group

28
00:01:14.933 --> 00:01:17.233
There are also plagiarism villains
