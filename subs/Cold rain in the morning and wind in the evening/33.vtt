00:00:00.466 --> 00:00:02.533
You see, this is the daughter of the soul.

2
00:00:02.533 --> 00:00:04.333
It doesn't look like a soul at all

3
00:00:04.333 --> 00:00:05.966
The soul doesn't mean that his daughter is in the Los Angeles group

4
00:00:05.966 --> 00:00:06.900
Are you a designer?

5
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:08.133
Why did you come to be a servant?

6
00:00:08.133 --> 00:00:09.466
You haven't heard?

7
00:00:09.466 --> 00:00:11.333
He plagiarized the design of the eldest lady

8
00:00:11.333 --> 00:00:12.766
I was fired.

9
00:00:12.766 --> 00:00:14.766
No wonder mouse children make holes

10
00:00:14.766 --> 00:00:17.466
The soul is a servant, and his daughter should also be a servant

11
00:00:19.966 --> 00:00:21.166
Have you two said enough?

12
00:00:21.166 --> 00:00:23.000
I can say whatever I don't want to say

13
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.366
Can you handle it?

14
00:00:24.366 --> 00:00:25.700
You dare to hit people

15
00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.233
Why do you want a slap too?

16
00:00:28.766 --> 00:00:29.700
Don't be arrogant

17
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:32.466
I'll report it to the housekeeper and let him take care of you.

18
00:00:36.166 --> 00:00:37.933
You took a risk to come to Luo's house

19
00:00:37.933 --> 00:00:40.366
Isn't it to clean up these two mediocre Chinese meals?

20
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.266
No, definitely not.

21
00:00:42.666 --> 00:00:45.433
The two of them barely count as interest

22
00:00:52.733 --> 00:00:54.000
Eat something

23
00:00:57.366 --> 00:00:59.233
The dead cannot come back to life

24
00:00:59.666 --> 00:01:01.433
Aunt Lin Hong is in Tianzhilian

25
00:01:01.766 --> 00:01:03.633
I don't want to see you like this either.

26
00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.666
I don't have a mother anymore.

27
00:01:06.533 --> 00:01:09.500
What else in this world is worth my nostalgia

28
00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:11.500
you

29
00:01:13.366 --> 00:01:14.600
You still have me

30
00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.366
You, Nini, you

31
00:01:20.766 --> 00:01:22.766
Remember when you were a child

32
00:01:22.766 --> 00:01:25.966
Did you save a little boy in the Luo warehouse?

33
00:01:25.966 --> 00:01:27.133
I've been looking for you for a long time.

34
00:01:27.133 --> 00:01:29.366
After finally finding you

35
00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.633
Let me take care of you, okay?

36
00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:38.833
little brother

37
00:01:39.666 --> 00:01:41.166
Please help me

38
00:01:51.066 --> 00:01:52.666
What exactly do you want to do?

39
00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.566
Mom, don't worry.

40
00:01:57.366 --> 00:02:00.400
I will definitely send Luo Xueqing down to accompany you.
