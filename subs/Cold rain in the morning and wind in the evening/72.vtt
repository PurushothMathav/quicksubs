00:00:00.966 --> 00:00:02.100
Are you crazy?

2
00:00:02.333 --> 00:00:03.366
You just jump off.

3
00:00:03.366 --> 00:00:04.933
Why are you dragging me to die together?

4
00:00:04.933 --> 00:00:05.566
I told you before.

5
00:00:05.566 --> 00:00:07.966
I want my mom to see you one last time

6
00:00:08.266 --> 00:00:10.266
Since you don't want to see him

7
00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.500
I'll have to take you to see him

8
00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.466
Ok read

9
00:00:14.866 --> 00:00:17.266
I was wrong, I beg you to forgive me, okay?

10
00:00:17.266 --> 00:00:20.033
I apologize to you as long as you are willing to let me go

11
00:00:20.566 --> 00:00:23.300
I'm only 20 and I don't want to apologize to me

12
00:00:23.666 --> 00:00:26.433
I don't need your apology either.

13
00:00:27.966 --> 00:00:31.866
Yeah soul I should apologize to soul

14
00:00:31.866 --> 00:00:32.766
I promise you.

15
00:00:32.766 --> 00:00:33.933
As long as you let me go

16
00:00:33.933 --> 00:00:35.133
I promise to apologize to the soul

17
00:00:35.133 --> 00:00:35.933
I promise.

18
00:00:35.933 --> 00:00:37.966
Until now, you still dare not call her mom

19
00:00:50.766 --> 00:00:52.966
If it weren't for the audience being late

20
00:00:53.333 --> 00:00:55.266
You should have died a long time ago

21
00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:42.300
This is business in the 2000s.

22
00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:43.666
Is he on the rooftop?

23
00:01:43.666 --> 00:01:44.833
Go to the rooftop

24
00:01:52.066 --> 00:01:53.400
Let me refit the line before that year

25
00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.600
And that leads to the rooftop.
