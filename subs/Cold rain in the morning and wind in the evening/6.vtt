00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:00.900
Mom

2
00:00:01.533 --> 00:00:02.533
Rockefeller

3
00:00:02.533 --> 00:00:05.200
I'll fight with you, you dead girl

4
00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.400
Don't be impulsive, mom, it's alright

5
00:00:07.533 --> 00:00:10.166
Mom, it's okay, let's go

6
00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:11.266
Come on.

7
00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.233
Stop! Did I let you go?

8
00:00:15.366 --> 00:00:18.100
Lin Nian Nian hasn't apologized to me yet

9
00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:19.200
I didn't do anything wrong.

10
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.266
Why should I apologize?

11
00:00:21.133 --> 00:00:22.266
Aunt Heihu

12
00:00:22.733 --> 00:00:25.300
This Lin Niannian just pushed me

13
00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.633
Shouldn't he apologize to me?

14
00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:29.733
Aunt Soul

15
00:00:29.733 --> 00:00:31.833
I didn't mean to target you either.

16
00:00:32.066 --> 00:00:35.766
It's just that you just hit my sports car

17
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
As long as he is willing to apologize to me

18
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.000
I can let go of the past

19
00:00:40.566 --> 00:00:43.266
You can also fall without leaving the frame.

20
00:00:44.133 --> 00:00:45.333
Is that right?

21
00:00:45.333 --> 00:00:48.066
Mom, don't believe his nonsense.

22
00:00:48.066 --> 00:00:49.500
Of course, Aunt Soul.

23
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.066
I am in love with snow

24
00:00:51.066 --> 00:00:52.566
Count

25
00:00:55.566 --> 00:00:56.366
Nini

26
00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.900
Why don't you apologize to the eldest lady?

27
00:01:00.266 --> 00:01:01.900
Okay? Why?

28
00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:05.800
Mom they all do this to you and you

29
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.266
Sorry.

30
00:01:07.933 --> 00:01:09.866
Just be a mom, please

31
00:01:16.566 --> 00:01:17.366
Sorry.

32
00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.000
raw

33
00:01:33.366 --> 00:01:34.166
pissed

34
00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:37.433
Oh girl

35
00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:39.300
You can go back to him.

36
00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.466
I'm going back to get a design draft

37
00:01:45.166 --> 00:01:47.500
What's the matter?

38
00:01:48.133 --> 00:01:49.866
It's a little bloody.

39
00:01:50.666 --> 00:01:53.000
I'm sorry

40
00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:55.066
Dad shouldn't have forced you to apologize

41
00:01:55.666 --> 00:01:57.700
Just draw another design draft

42
00:01:57.966 --> 00:01:59.600
Mom's health matters

43
00:01:59.733 --> 00:02:00.866
It's alright mom

44
00:02:01.533 --> 00:02:02.733
You're my mom.

45
00:02:02.733 --> 00:02:03.866
Listen to you more

46
00:02:09.666 --> 00:02:11.533
What a mess to put on the sofa

47
00:02:11.533 --> 00:02:13.800
The nanny in this house is really getting more and more unruly

48
00:02:17.566 --> 00:02:19.033
Such an excellent design draft

49
00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:20.400
Is it?

50
00:02:21.666 --> 00:02:23.300
It was you who missed the poor and asked him to draw it.

51
00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:24.366
Why should he

52
00:02:27.966 --> 00:02:29.666
Since I found out

53
00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.066
That's mine.

54
00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:37.366
Xueqin, you made your favorite soup

55
00:02:37.733 --> 00:02:41.000
Mom, I want to go to the design department of Roselle Group

56
00:02:41.766 --> 00:02:42.666
OK

57
00:02:42.733 --> 00:02:45.766
Mom arranged for you to go to Roselle Group as the director of the design department
