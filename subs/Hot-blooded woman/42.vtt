00:00:01.766 --> 00:00:03.900
Is this the strongest in history?

2
00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:05.800
Do you want to compare and see who can solve more?

3
00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:08.366
Compare who is afraid of who

4
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.900
Come on, boss, don't worry

5
00:00:21.066 --> 00:00:22.566
Hurry up and call someone

6
00:00:27.133 --> 00:00:30.566
Hey, why is there no signal?

7
00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:34.366
15 hits

8
00:00:34.366 --> 00:00:35.466
Please don't let the water out.

9
00:00:35.466 --> 00:00:37.200
I hit 16, one more than you.

10
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.966
Hmph, fart, you are obviously only 14 lines

11
00:00:39.966 --> 00:00:40.933
You are awesome

12
00:00:40.933 --> 00:00:43.666
And they are a bit fierce, what are they afraid of?

13
00:00:43.666 --> 00:00:44.766
There are so many of us

14
00:00:44.766 --> 00:00:47.066
The cannon is also exhausted, isn't there still the two of you?

15
00:00:47.066 --> 00:00:50.366
Get on, get on, get on the car
