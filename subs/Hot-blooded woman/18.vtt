00:00:05.366 --> 00:00:08.833
Oh, boss, your heart is so big

2
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:11.933
Wasn't it your loudest shout before?

3
00:00:11.933 --> 00:00:13.500
Why are you cowardly now?

4
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:14.800
I'm not afraid

5
00:00:14.866 --> 00:00:16.500
I'm just worried about fraud.

6
00:00:17.733 --> 00:00:19.000
There are so many of them

7
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.966
Do you think we can do it?

8
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.933
Well, that's it.

9
00:00:23.933 --> 00:00:24.933
Never again

10
00:00:24.933 --> 00:00:26.466
It's really a shrinking turtle

11
00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.566
Besides, what is there to be afraid of a group of little girls?

12
00:00:30.566 --> 00:00:33.000
Shen Qingyan, you are crazy

13
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.133
What are you doing here?

14
00:00:34.133 --> 00:00:35.333
What am I doing here?

15
00:00:35.333 --> 00:00:37.266
I came to see if your brain was broken

16
00:00:37.533 --> 00:00:40.466
Your brain is broken. How many people are you?

17
00:00:40.466 --> 00:00:41.900
Do you know what to resist at half past?

18
00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.633
You declare war, what's your business?

19
00:00:43.733 --> 00:00:44.966
You listen to me.

20
00:00:44.966 --> 00:00:47.133
You are now taking your people to join the Poetry Society

21
00:00:47.133 --> 00:00:48.433
I'll go through the back door with you

22
00:00:48.566 --> 00:00:50.833
At that time, people at 7:30 will also be afraid

23
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:52.700
It just passed.

24
00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.000
Oh, don't worry about it.

25
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.800
I'll do my own thing.

26
00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.300
Why don't you know what's good?

27
00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.733
I'm doing this for your own good.

28
00:00:58.733 --> 00:01:01.800
Go back, I'll take care of my own business

29
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.166
Who cares about you?

30
00:01:03.166 --> 00:01:04.500
I'm pissed off.

31
00:01:08.366 --> 00:01:09.266
Did you hear?

32
00:01:09.266 --> 00:01:11.200
The newcomer is now going to work again at 7:30

33
00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.000
I rely on real or fake

34
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.466
Is he alright?

35
00:01:14.466 --> 00:01:15.466
I don't think so either.

36
00:01:15.666 --> 00:01:16.633
You say

37
00:01:16.766 --> 00:01:18.900
He really thought he killed a blood gang by himself

38
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.800
I thought I was a character

39
00:01:22.866 --> 00:01:23.866
What's up?

40
00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.700
Who's mad at you again, Jiang Lu, do me a favor

41
00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.333
It's for that Shen Qingyan again

42
00:01:28.333 --> 00:01:29.866
I owe him one.

43
00:01:33.766 --> 00:01:36.800
I'd like to see if he's worth my money
