00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:07.066
Feishang, I have admitted defeat, what else do you want?

2
00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:10.433
What are you going to do with me in the future?

3
00:00:11.533 --> 00:00:15.233
I don't know, your martial arts are actually so good

4
00:00:15.566 --> 00:00:16.733
Do you want to join us?

5
00:00:16.733 --> 00:00:18.800
Are you pitying me now?

6
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.200
I would rather leave SM forever.

7
00:00:21.366 --> 00:00:22.900
I won't join you either

8
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.033
Well, then I won't force it.

9
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.400
Why did you start recruiting?

10
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:32.666
I think

11
00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:34.766
It's indeed a little less

12
00:00:34.766 --> 00:00:36.333
Since you want to recruit

13
00:00:36.333 --> 00:00:38.066
Then you have to think of a combination name

14
00:00:38.866 --> 00:00:41.833
What is a good name for the combination?

15
00:00:42.466 --> 00:00:43.833
A few domineering ones

16
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.600
Yeah, the Tigress Society.

17
00:00:50.366 --> 00:00:52.033
You are the tigress

18
00:00:54.133 --> 00:00:56.366
316 can't burn

19
00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.266
Spring breeze blows again

20
00:00:58.266 --> 00:00:59.666
Let's call it wildfire

21
00:00:59.666 --> 00:01:02.266
I think it's better to call it 316

22
00:01:02.266 --> 00:01:02.500
But

23
00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.666
316 doesn't sound like the name of a gang

24
00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.366
Hmm, but 316's name is really nice.

25
00:01:09.366 --> 00:01:10.200
Shen Qingyan

26
00:01:10.466 --> 00:01:12.966
Since you start forming gangs today

27
00:01:12.966 --> 00:01:15.500
Then we're officially rivals

28
00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.966
Anytime. Let's go.

29
00:01:24.466 --> 00:01:26.966
Song Qiuzi, why are you here?

30
00:01:26.966 --> 00:01:28.566
You also came to see my jokes

31
00:01:28.566 --> 00:01:31.266
Hahaha, just a lost dog

32
00:01:31.266 --> 00:01:33.800
What right do you have to call me by my name?

33
00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.400
Then what are you doing here?

34
00:01:35.666 --> 00:01:36.966
I just want to see

35
00:01:36.966 --> 00:01:38.866
Do you still have value?

36
00:01:38.933 --> 00:01:40.466
Want me to be your lackey

37
00:01:40.466 --> 00:01:41.266
No way.

38
00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:43.600
I know you're not that kind of person

39
00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.766
You can't stay with SM anyway

40
00:01:45.766 --> 00:01:48.466
I just need you to do one thing for me

41
00:01:48.466 --> 00:01:51.200
What makes you think I'll help you?

42
00:01:51.566 --> 00:01:53.466
With him
