00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.000
Did you hear?

2
00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.366
Fell at 7:30

3
00:00:02.366 --> 00:00:04.366
The flying window has become a lonely family

4
00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:06.300
Hmm, it seems like a new arrival.

5
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:09.333
What are you doing? The new person's name is Shen Qingyan

6
00:00:09.333 --> 00:00:10.966
Boss Shen, show me some respect

7
00:00:10.966 --> 00:00:13.233
Isn't it better than Song Qiuci, Boss Song?

8
00:00:13.666 --> 00:00:16.133
Song Qiuci is a philanthropist who spent real money

9
00:00:16.133 --> 00:00:17.500
You got the money, of course.

10
00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.000
I received 3,000 yuan

11
00:00:19.466 --> 00:00:22.066
At least my dad doesn't have to send me money for two months

12
00:00:22.266 --> 00:00:22.900
Not that

13
00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.166
Do I have to join the Inspectorate to get paid?

14
00:00:25.166 --> 00:00:25.700
You joined

15
00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:26.866
Yes, joined

16
00:00:26.866 --> 00:00:29.300
As long as I give money, I can recognize Boss Song as my mother

17
00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.133
Let alone join the inspectorate

18
00:00:31.133 --> 00:00:34.800
Then your dad is happy. Hey, what are you talking about?

19
00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:39.433
Don't leave if you have the ability.

20
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.500
Hello everyone, the original 7:30 family

21
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:45.700
My name is Qi Le

22
00:00:45.766 --> 00:00:47.866
I'm sure you've all heard of it.

23
00:00:47.866 --> 00:00:50.633
I am the second boss of 316.

24
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.366
But why are you so crowded today?

25
00:00:55.466 --> 00:00:57.000
Everyone else is for the grant

26
00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:58.966
But joined the inspector team

27
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.433
So many people just fill out a form

28
00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.466
If you say you are poor, you can get money

29
00:01:03.766 --> 00:01:04.900
So they all went

30
00:01:05.533 --> 00:01:07.800
It's okay, no matter how few people are there.

31
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:11.233
So we can get serious about doing art

32
00:01:12.266 --> 00:01:14.600
Do you understand art?

33
00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:15.400
how

34
00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:18.166
Do you have an opinion? Your boss fights badly.

35
00:01:18.166 --> 00:01:20.300
Musical instruments are not necessarily playable

36
00:01:21.333 --> 00:01:24.400
It seems that it is time to show your hands

37
00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.633
So listen up, everybody.

38
00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:33.466
Here we go.

39
00:01:33.466 --> 00:01:36.500
I'm going to give you a little bit of an artistic shock.
