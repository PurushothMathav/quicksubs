00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:02.466
This Shen Qingyan just came this year.

2
00:00:02.466 --> 00:00:05.166
Killed a small group of blood gangs in less than a week

3
00:00:05.166 --> 00:00:07.266
Liu Binbin's strength is like that

4
00:00:07.266 --> 00:00:08.566
Nothing.

5
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.266
But it's only been a week.

6
00:00:11.266 --> 00:00:12.966
So appealing

7
00:00:12.966 --> 00:00:14.500
He's quite a talent.

8
00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:15.300
Ah.

9
00:00:15.966 --> 00:00:17.700
Why am I wrong?

10
00:00:17.733 --> 00:00:21.766
The Blood Gang was solved by him alone with gambling skills?

11
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:23.766
You go on

12
00:00:24.066 --> 00:00:25.800
Less than a week later

13
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.366
He declared war again at 7:30

14
00:00:27.366 --> 00:00:30.933
As a result, Shen Qingyan pressed the frost

15
00:00:30.933 --> 00:00:32.500
But flying frost is not easy to mess with

16
00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:33.966
Kidnapped his men

17
00:00:33.966 --> 00:00:36.400
In the end, he could only force Shen Qingyan to admit defeat

18
00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:40.766
Well, this is indeed Feishang's usual style

19
00:00:41.166 --> 00:00:43.500
Did Shi Xinhui's gang win Shen Qingyan over?

20
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:44.666
Yes, when yes.

21
00:00:44.666 --> 00:00:46.600
But Shen Qingyan never agreed

22
00:00:46.666 --> 00:00:47.333
But

23
00:00:47.333 --> 00:00:49.200
Shi Xinhui's Lily Ai has always been very close to him

24
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.866
I'm going to order this person.

25
00:00:52.166 --> 00:00:53.666
Shi Xinhui, don't try to succeed

26
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.700
Give me his information

27
00:00:55.766 --> 00:00:57.566
It's ready for the captain

28
00:01:00.266 --> 00:01:02.733
Captain, do you want me to test it first?

29
00:01:02.733 --> 00:01:05.066
No such person

30
00:01:05.266 --> 00:01:07.366
It's worth my while.
