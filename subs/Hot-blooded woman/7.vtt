00:00:00.766 --> 00:00:01.766
Where are the others? I'll find them myself.

2
00:00:01.766 --> 00:00:02.600
Next building, third floor.

3
00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:04.266
Go up the stairs, turn right and keep walking until you see it.

4
00:00:04.266 --> 00:00:06.400
Boss, you still have to be careful

5
00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.200
It's the territory of the Blood Gang

6
00:00:08.533 --> 00:00:10.666
Well, boss, I'll go with you

7
00:00:10.733 --> 00:00:11.500
You don't have to go.

8
00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:13.700
I'll go by myself, maybe I don't have to fight

9
00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:16.266
Why? Because I used to be in the Blood Gang.

10
00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.900
Ok, are you alright?

11
00:00:22.966 --> 00:00:26.100
They almost killed me

12
00:00:26.366 --> 00:00:28.300
Tian Fang, you traitor

13
00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:29.366
How dare you come?

14
00:00:29.366 --> 00:00:32.433
Liu Bingbing, it was you who let me down

15
00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:33.800
I don't care about you.

16
00:00:34.066 --> 00:00:35.500
Let Qi Luo go now

17
00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.533
A traitor still dares to drink six in these 15

18
00:00:38.533 --> 00:00:41.100
Tianfang, is there something wrong with your brain?

19
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.366
Oh, right. I forgot. You got a backer now

20
00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:46.700
This is it.

21
00:00:47.566 --> 00:00:50.366
Hello, you are Liu Binbin, right?

22
00:00:50.666 --> 00:00:52.466
I'm going to give you two options.

23
00:00:52.533 --> 00:00:54.500
The first is to let it go

24
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:55.800
Kneel down and apologize to him

25
00:00:56.066 --> 00:00:58.733
The second is that I beat you up

26
00:00:58.733 --> 00:01:00.300
You kneel down and apologize to Qi Le

27
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.200
This is my blood gang's turf

28
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:06.566
how

29
00:01:07.266 --> 00:01:08.700
Want to fight?
