00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:04.900
Who did it, Captain?

2
00:00:05.366 --> 00:00:08.133
It's me, Chen Xiuliang, it's you

3
00:00:08.133 --> 00:00:09.566
Do you know what you're doing?

4
00:00:09.566 --> 00:00:12.333
Captain, do you know what you're doing?

5
00:00:12.333 --> 00:00:14.266
What right do you have to question me?

6
00:00:14.266 --> 00:00:15.766
I gave you so much money

7
00:00:15.766 --> 00:00:17.133
Open the door for me now

8
00:00:17.133 --> 00:00:18.600
You mean that money?

9
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.066
I save all the flowers

10
00:00:21.166 --> 00:00:22.966
I won't open the door

11
00:00:22.966 --> 00:00:25.466
You can't take them away today.

12
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.533
I'm sending them to learn technology

13
00:00:27.533 --> 00:00:29.200
Wait until they have a good way out in the future

14
00:00:29.866 --> 00:00:32.266
Captain, based on what I know about you

15
00:00:32.266 --> 00:00:33.633
You should be lying.

16
00:00:33.666 --> 00:00:35.433
You want to push them into the pit of fire

17
00:00:35.733 --> 00:00:38.066
How dare you slander me?

18
00:00:38.066 --> 00:00:40.133
Come and beat this traitor to death

19
00:00:40.133 --> 00:00:41.766
I was never a traitor

20
00:00:41.766 --> 00:00:44.166
I was sent by Sister Lu to be an undercover agent by your side

21
00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.433
Since you've never been your dog in your heart

22
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.266
Why did the traitor say it?

23
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.200
You

24
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:50.600
you

25
00:00:52.466 --> 00:00:55.500
It's okay, you're alone now.

26
00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.500
Who said he was alone?

27
00:01:01.266 --> 00:01:02.766
You all lied to me.

28
00:01:02.766 --> 00:01:04.433
You are all liars

29
00:01:04.733 --> 00:01:05.733
Song QiuCi

30
00:01:05.733 --> 00:01:07.966
You have the nerve to call us liars.

31
00:01:07.966 --> 00:01:10.000
We have already detected all your conspiracies

32
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.866
We just don't know your specific goals

33
00:01:11.866 --> 00:01:14.500
That's why I've been patiently observing your movements

34
00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:15.533
I didn't expect it.

35
00:01:15.533 --> 00:01:17.533
How dare you kidnap and sell girls?

36
00:01:17.533 --> 00:01:18.800
Are you still human?
