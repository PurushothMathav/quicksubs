00:00:02.733 --> 00:00:03.666
Shen Qingyan

2
00:00:04.066 --> 00:00:06.700
You actually joined the division to come against me

3
00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:08.233
I didn't call them

4
00:00:08.533 --> 00:00:10.666
Didn't I tell you not to help me?

5
00:00:11.666 --> 00:00:12.966
Who wants to help you?

6
00:00:12.966 --> 00:00:14.366
I think our president wants to see you

7
00:00:14.366 --> 00:00:16.066
Jiang Lu, what do you mean?

8
00:00:16.066 --> 00:00:17.100
I don't mean anything.

9
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.700
I'm just not used to more bullying less

10
00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:22.766
It seems that the legendary strongest person in history is you.

11
00:00:22.766 --> 00:00:23.800
Just a name

12
00:00:24.366 --> 00:00:25.933
Come and be a friend.

13
00:00:25.933 --> 00:00:26.866
My name is Jiang Lu

14
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
I don't want to be your friend. Why?

15
00:00:29.366 --> 00:00:30.900
Sooner or later we have a war

16
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.366
I'm afraid I won't be able to be ruthless by then

17
00:00:32.366 --> 00:00:34.233
Hahajiang Road

18
00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:37.100
You are hot face sticking to other people's cold butt

19
00:00:37.133 --> 00:00:37.966
Sister Lu

20
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.600
Shen Qingyan fell over yesterday and his brain was broken

21
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:41.766
Don't argue with him

22
00:00:41.766 --> 00:00:42.800
Don't talk nonsense

23
00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:43.200
actually

24
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.366
I'm not here for either of you at all

25
00:00:45.366 --> 00:00:47.100
I just can't watch young people get married

26
00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.000
If a few people die, it will be even more troublesome

27
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.900
Since you two have already placed the gauntlet

28
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.866
Then you two go head-to-head

29
00:00:53.966 --> 00:00:55.733
Win or lose, there is an explanation

30
00:00:55.733 --> 00:00:57.333
How about that? I have no problem with that.

31
00:00:57.333 --> 00:00:57.700
I am afraid

32
00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.300
Some people have so many subordinates who can work for them

33
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.933
Why take the risk yourself?

34
00:01:01.933 --> 00:01:04.100
Are you really worried that I am a vegetarian?

35
00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:05.866
Come to single, single
