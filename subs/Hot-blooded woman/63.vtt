00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:03.600
Shen Qingyan didn't expect you to have such a good place

2
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.300
Yeah, that's nice.

3
00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:07.200
That's what Kira told me.

4
00:00:07.266 --> 00:00:08.333
It's all his credit

5
00:00:08.333 --> 00:00:09.600
You can do it

6
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:11.500
Attachment you didn't tell me earlier

7
00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:12.966
Tell you what?

8
00:00:12.966 --> 00:00:14.200
You didn't tell me

9
00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:15.300
How did you know so quickly?

10
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:16.600
Generations have been locked up in that place

11
00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.266
It's a secret.

12
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.500
Can't tell now

13
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.900
Isn't there an undercover agent in the inspection team?

14
00:00:22.166 --> 00:00:24.533
Let me guess who?

15
00:00:24.533 --> 00:00:27.200
Do you still care more about Yan Fang and Han Lili?

16
00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.100
Hello everyone, my name is Song Qiuci

17
00:00:36.566 --> 00:00:38.966
Whether you knew me before or not

18
00:00:38.966 --> 00:00:40.366
From now on

19
00:00:40.366 --> 00:00:42.500
I will take responsibility for you.

20
00:00:42.533 --> 00:00:45.433
Be more conscientious than your parents

21
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.200
Because they can't give you a future

22
00:00:48.266 --> 00:00:51.533
And I can give you a better future captain

23
00:00:51.533 --> 00:00:52.800
So what do we do?

24
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.333
I will send you abroad for art training

25
00:00:55.333 --> 00:00:57.033
Then go back to work as an artist

26
00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.066
Singing, dancing, acting

27
00:00:59.066 --> 00:01:01.200
Then make a lot of money and go abroad

28
00:01:01.666 --> 00:01:04.966
Yes, foreign art training is more systematic.

29
00:01:04.966 --> 00:01:07.300
More professional in terms of cost

30
00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:08.800
It's all up to me
