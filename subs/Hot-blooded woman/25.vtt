00:00:00.933 --> 00:00:02.400
Run fast run fast

2
00:00:06.566 --> 00:00:08.400
Okay, you can run the slowest.

3
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:09.500
Run faster!

4
00:00:09.766 --> 00:00:11.500
Is it a big burden?

5
00:00:12.166 --> 00:00:15.500
Why does the boss have to train on the beach?

6
00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.100
Then find an ordinary place

7
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.600
Can I exercise differently?

8
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.866
Sand has twice the resistance of regular ground.

9
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.233
Cut SM people multi-eyed

10
00:00:24.266 --> 00:00:26.466
Hurry up and run, or I won't have you to eat tonight

11
00:00:26.466 --> 00:00:28.233
Ouch hum

12
00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:31.200
boss

13
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.666
SM Park recently heard that a girl went missing

14
00:00:34.666 --> 00:00:36.800
It's panicking, I've heard

15
00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.066
I heard that he went out to buy something and did not return to the dormitory.

16
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.500
SN Park has always been a place of lawlessness

17
00:00:43.733 --> 00:00:45.666
We have to protect ourselves.

18
00:00:46.133 --> 00:00:46.966
OK

19
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.366
Boss, can this work?

20
00:00:50.566 --> 00:00:52.266
It's too revealing

21
00:00:53.533 --> 00:00:55.100
If you don't go, who will?

22
00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.000
You are the best shape we have here, okay?

23
00:00:58.133 --> 00:01:00.000
With great power comes great responsibility

24
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.500
I would do anything for those innocent girls

25
00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:03.700
Mmm bliss

26
00:01:03.733 --> 00:01:04.900
You must protect yourself.

27
00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:06.200
Yeah, it's okay.

28
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.800
Aren't you there?
