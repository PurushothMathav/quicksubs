00:00:01.066 --> 00:00:02.700
Uh-huh.

2
00:00:05.533 --> 00:00:08.066
How about the realistic hit I just called

3
00:00:08.866 --> 00:00:09.666
cow

4
00:00:10.933 --> 00:00:14.200
Okay, your partner said it

5
00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:15.966
It's your turn.

6
00:00:19.266 --> 00:00:20.300
We don't know anything.

7
00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:21.466
Just for the money

8
00:00:22.066 --> 00:00:23.400
Just get a girl in the car

9
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.300
The guy gave us 5,000 bucks

10
00:00:25.866 --> 00:00:27.633
5,000 bucks.

11
00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.566
You do this kind of thing

12
00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.600
Do you know the girl you cheated on?

13
00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:32.900
How pitiful it is now

14
00:00:32.966 --> 00:00:34.966
I have no money, I can't even afford to eat

15
00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.100
We are both being blackmailed by your organizations

16
00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:38.066
When asked

17
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.866
Who has ever felt sorry for us?

18
00:00:40.866 --> 00:00:41.166
Sure enough

19
00:00:41.166 --> 00:00:44.266
Some people are secretly targeting the girls in the park

20
00:00:44.266 --> 00:00:45.800
Their words match

21
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.466
But they're just two little guys who see money

22
00:00:48.566 --> 00:00:50.000
It doesn't work at all.

23
00:00:50.566 --> 00:00:52.233
After this

24
00:00:52.266 --> 00:00:54.466
That car should never show up again

25
00:00:54.766 --> 00:00:56.500
The clue is broken

26
00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:57.800
Why were you there?

27
00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.700
I've been squatting for several nights in a row

28
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:00.766
You thought it was an accident

29
00:01:00.766 --> 00:01:02.366
If I hadn't arranged the bait

30
00:01:02.366 --> 00:01:03.333
You have to continue to be stupid

31
00:01:03.333 --> 00:01:04.800
Just squat there for a few more days

32
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.000
I just don't want my people to take risks

33
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.966
If the riding music was brought into the car at that time

34
00:01:08.966 --> 00:01:10.266
What should I do if the car runs away?

35
00:01:10.266 --> 00:01:13.266
You chase with two legs, you and me
