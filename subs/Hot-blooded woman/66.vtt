00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.166
Captain Yan Fang is right

2
00:00:02.166 --> 00:00:03.366
Everyone else is using 2,000.

3
00:00:03.366 --> 00:00:04.866
When you have an extra set of cosmetics

4
00:00:04.866 --> 00:00:07.500
I can't even afford a $10 bottle of face oil

5
00:00:07.566 --> 00:00:09.300
But have you ever thought about saving money?

6
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:10.766
You're both right.

7
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.900
Exactly.

8
00:00:11.933 --> 00:00:15.800
Only money is the most important thing in this world

9
00:00:16.166 --> 00:00:16.900
So

10
00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.566
All those who stand in your way of making money should be brought down

11
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:23.400
Did you hear that?

12
00:00:23.466 --> 00:00:26.266
Good. You are always ready.

13
00:00:26.333 --> 00:00:28.966
I will send you abroad at any time these days.

14
00:00:28.966 --> 00:00:30.366
But we don't have passports.

15
00:00:30.366 --> 00:00:31.333
I didn't get a visa.

16
00:00:31.333 --> 00:00:33.700
You don't have to worry about that.

17
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.133
If you can't even handle these

18
00:00:36.133 --> 00:00:37.733
How can I still call Song Qiu Temple?

19
00:00:37.733 --> 00:00:40.700
Don't worry, just wait.

20
00:00:40.866 --> 00:00:43.733
The captain's energy is beyond your imagination

21
00:00:43.733 --> 00:00:44.666
Before going abroad

22
00:00:44.666 --> 00:00:47.433
I'll give each of you an extra living allowance

23
00:00:47.566 --> 00:00:48.833
Not many.

24
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.966
That's 100,000 bucks

25
00:00:50.966 --> 00:00:53.233
Long live the captain wow thank you captain

26
00:00:53.266 --> 00:00:55.433
Go crazy if you want to succeed

27
00:00:55.566 --> 00:00:58.100
Rush forward regardless of everything

28
00:00:58.466 --> 00:01:00.300
Does Song Qiuci have any background?

29
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.566
Otherwise, how could he be so rich?

30
00:01:01.566 --> 00:01:03.700
Background? Yes, there must be

31
00:01:03.766 --> 00:01:05.600
It's just that no one knows who it is

32
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:06.300
OK

33
00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:09.066
It's really uncomfortable to not have a fight for too long.

34
00:01:09.066 --> 00:01:10.733
Jianglu, why don't we fight today?

35
00:01:10.733 --> 00:01:12.100
Take the lead and run, are you sick?

36
00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:13.533
Enemy Current

37
00:01:13.533 --> 00:01:14.966
No no no boss

38
00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.233
Do you want to change the flavor of the lollipop?

39
00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.266
I have prepared several different flavors

40
00:01:19.266 --> 00:01:21.300
Oops, I like that flavor of lollipop.

41
00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.166
Only little kids love candy
