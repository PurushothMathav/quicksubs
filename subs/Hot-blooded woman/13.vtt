00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:01.966
Why are you working as a waiter here?

2
00:00:02.266 --> 00:00:04.500
Oh, I just work part-time.

3
00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:06.366
Earn some living expenses

4
00:00:06.366 --> 00:00:07.733
Have you talked enough?

5
00:00:07.733 --> 00:00:08.933
When I am air

6
00:00:08.933 --> 00:00:09.866
What do you want?

7
00:00:09.866 --> 00:00:11.500
Or kowtow to me and apologize

8
00:00:11.533 --> 00:00:13.266
Or pay me 100,000 for my clothes

9
00:00:13.266 --> 00:00:14.266
You can decide for yourself.

10
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.466
Oh, everyone is in the same district.

11
00:00:16.466 --> 00:00:17.666
Why don't you look at this?

12
00:00:17.666 --> 00:00:18.966
I'll pay you 1,000 bucks

13
00:00:18.966 --> 00:00:21.433
That's it. What? 1,000.

14
00:00:21.733 --> 00:00:24.366
You send beggars 1,000

15
00:00:24.466 --> 00:00:25.866
You don't like us at half past seven

16
00:00:25.866 --> 00:00:27.266
Still don't know who we are at half past seven

17
00:00:27.266 --> 00:00:29.000
You are indeed people at half past seven

18
00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:31.266
What is Lili at half past seven?

19
00:00:31.266 --> 00:00:32.700
Another organization in the cloud area

20
00:00:32.766 --> 00:00:35.400
Pretty ruthless, huh?

21
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.333
Just know

22
00:00:37.333 --> 00:00:39.066
Do you know what he does?

23
00:00:39.066 --> 00:00:40.533
Isn't he just a waiter?

24
00:00:40.533 --> 00:00:42.666
Hey, you don't know that, do you?

25
00:00:42.666 --> 00:00:44.633
He is the teacher's heart

26
00:00:44.666 --> 00:00:46.266
I think you two

27
00:00:46.266 --> 00:00:47.566
You can learn from each other.

28
00:00:47.566 --> 00:00:48.600
See who is better

29
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.266
Hey, your teacher will know

30
00:00:50.266 --> 00:00:52.133
What I hate the most is the Teacher's Heart Association

31
00:00:52.133 --> 00:00:54.033
I'll kill you without losing money.

32
00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:57.633
Hey, you don't fight

33
00:00:57.666 --> 00:00:59.066
I've never been in a fight.

34
00:01:01.533 --> 00:01:03.433
Forget it, even if I am soft-hearted today
