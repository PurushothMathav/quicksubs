00:00:00.466 --> 00:00:02.466
Ah, didn't you just let him go?

2
00:00:02.466 --> 00:00:04.966
How can your business be done without letting him go?

3
00:00:04.966 --> 00:00:05.700
Yeah.

4
00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.000
A 7:30 lunatic is not something ordinary people can mess with

5
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.433
It's all your fault

6
00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:13.766
Our teacher's heart is not afraid of 7:30

7
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:15.533
How about joining?

8
00:00:15.533 --> 00:00:16.700
Not interested

9
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.900
What about today? I owe you one

10
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.133
I will give it back to you later.

11
00:00:20.133 --> 00:00:21.266
Who cares?

12
00:00:21.266 --> 00:00:23.166
Okay, okay, okay, you have character.

13
00:00:23.166 --> 00:00:24.533
Bye bye

14
00:00:24.533 --> 00:00:25.433
Come on.

15
00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:27.666
Did you hear?

16
00:00:27.666 --> 00:00:29.000
The Blood Gang disbanded

17
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.266
It looks like a newcomer did it.

18
00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:33.900
Hey, Xiaojie heard that it was him.

19
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.466
Doesn't it look amazing?

20
00:00:36.466 --> 00:00:38.500
Liu Bingbing is so broken now

21
00:00:38.766 --> 00:00:40.066
Be quiet Liu Bingbing

22
00:00:40.066 --> 00:00:40.400
That crazy

23
00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.366
Dogs are not something that ordinary people can solve for me

24
00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:44.700
Hey boss

25
00:00:44.933 --> 00:00:47.533
They were just talking about you, just say it

26
00:00:47.533 --> 00:00:48.933
I can still gag people's mouths

27
00:00:48.933 --> 00:00:52.200
Am I not worried that people are afraid of being famous and pigs are afraid of being strong?

28
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.966
Hey, hey, you're the pig, hahaha.

29
00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:58.633
What's up boss

30
00:01:07.733 --> 00:01:09.966
7:30 so soon

31
00:01:09.966 --> 00:01:11.300
Sure enough, it was 7:30

32
00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:13.700
I haven't come to you yet, you come to me
