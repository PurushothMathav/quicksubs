00:00:01.466 --> 00:00:03.200
Dealing with Song Qiuci

2
00:00:03.766 --> 00:00:06.800
He is very powerful now.

3
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:08.533
There are many who follow him.

4
00:00:08.533 --> 00:00:11.033
Others are stupid, I'm not stupid

5
00:00:11.566 --> 00:00:13.566
If there is no conspiracy behind him

6
00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:14.833
You can't even shoot me

7
00:00:14.866 --> 00:00:17.966
Although I must have trampled him under my feet

8
00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:19.466
But not now.

9
00:00:22.266 --> 00:00:23.400
Wow, what do you want?

10
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.366
Shen Qing

11
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.866
I'm afraid there are more secrets behind you than Song Qiuxi

12
00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.066
Nonsense

13
00:00:29.066 --> 00:00:30.933
I am very simple and transparent

14
00:00:30.933 --> 00:00:32.566
Sex women love to fight

15
00:00:32.566 --> 00:00:34.700
If you don't want to deal with Song Qiuci

16
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.033
How could Yan Fang and Han Lili

17
00:00:37.133 --> 00:00:38.300
Join the inspectorate?

18
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.100
What boss?

19
00:00:40.266 --> 00:00:42.400
Tan Lili and R & D betrayed us

20
00:00:42.733 --> 00:00:45.866
Uh, these two women, I'm going to fuck them

21
00:00:48.566 --> 00:00:48.966
Hey

22
00:00:48.966 --> 00:00:52.266
Aren't the two of them from a poor family?

23
00:00:52.333 --> 00:00:54.800
I can't stop you if you want to go, right?

24
00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.333
Han Lili, I dare not say

25
00:00:56.333 --> 00:00:59.066
But I know Yan Fang very well

26
00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:02.766
He would never have abandoned 316 for 3,000 yuan

27
00:01:02.766 --> 00:01:05.566
Tell me, did you let them go?

28
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.400
Say it somewhere else

29
00:01:10.466 --> 00:01:13.000
Shen Qingyan, do you think

30
00:01:13.133 --> 00:01:15.566
All the organizations in the SM campus

31
00:01:15.566 --> 00:01:17.666
Solid is a cancer.

32
00:01:17.866 --> 00:01:19.566
Huh, isn't it?

33
00:01:19.566 --> 00:01:22.433
If you don't join an organization in this park, you will be expelled

34
00:01:22.533 --> 00:01:25.166
On my first day here, I was being blackmailed.

35
00:01:25.366 --> 00:01:26.666
That's a good point.

36
00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.400
But a little over a year ago

37
00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.766
This is the true dark place

38
00:01:32.166 --> 00:01:33.900
Managers were kicked out

39
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.400
Girls give up on themselves

40
00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:38.933
Receive a subsidy of dozens of dollars every month

41
00:01:38.933 --> 00:01:40.500
Then eat and wait to die

42
00:01:41.933 --> 00:01:44.066
Fallen Chaos

43
00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.433
Indulgence because this park is full of girls

44
00:01:47.533 --> 00:01:49.566
So there are countless forces eyeing this

45
00:01:49.566 --> 00:01:52.800
They used every means to rape in flames

46
00:01:53.066 --> 00:01:56.033
The world of rape and violence is endless

47
00:01:56.533 --> 00:01:58.033
There are a lot of girls

48
00:01:58.333 --> 00:02:00.266
All jumped off this rooftop

49
00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.033
Well, one time.

50
00:02:03.933 --> 00:02:05.900
I almost jumped from here too
