1
00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:01.666
Yes, Captain.

2
00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.500
Shen Qingyan beat me up when he first came

3
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.033
That's right, forcing us to let him be the boss

4
00:00:07.133 --> 00:00:08.900
He also said that he wants to dominate SM.

5
00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:10.500
Challenge the entire organization

6
00:00:10.966 --> 00:00:13.600
I did. Interesting guy.

7
00:00:13.933 --> 00:00:17.166
Are you two undercover agents sent by him?

8
00:00:17.733 --> 00:00:19.166
How is that possible?

9
00:00:19.166 --> 00:00:20.800
He didn't give us anything.

10
00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.633
How can I compare to you, captain?

11
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:28.966
Take it easy

12
00:00:30.333 --> 00:00:33.466
Even if you are really the undercover agents he sent

13
00:00:33.933 --> 00:00:36.266
You will surely know in the future

14
00:00:36.466 --> 00:00:39.900
Who is the most worthy of trust and follow?

15
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.566
Can Shen Qingyan make you a star?

16
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.566
Can he make you a lot of money?

17
00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.000
Captain, I grew up poor

18
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.600
So I know what's important.

19
00:00:50.066 --> 00:00:51.433
That Shen Qingyan

20
00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:53.600
I know how to fight every day

21
00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.200
Also said that I dominate SM

22
00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:57.700
So childish

23
00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:58.533
He doesn't know.

24
00:00:58.533 --> 00:01:00.966
When I couldn't even afford a pack of sanitary pads

25
00:01:00.966 --> 00:01:02.433
How am I feeling?
