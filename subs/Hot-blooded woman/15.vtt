00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:01.400
It's over. It's over.

2
00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:03.866
Oops, how could you offend 7:30?

3
00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:07.666
Hey, why don't I pay that Xu Yuan 100,000 yuan?

4
00:00:08.766 --> 00:00:10.600
You might as well give me the money

5
00:00:11.733 --> 00:00:14.200
Look at you two looking down.

6
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.566
Have you forgotten your boss's goal?

7
00:00:16.566 --> 00:00:18.333
Renovation park output

8
00:00:18.333 --> 00:00:20.366
7:30 was already in my plan

9
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:22.433
Since they don't come to me

10
00:00:22.466 --> 00:00:24.000
Then I'll go find them.

11
00:00:24.166 --> 00:00:25.766
Is there anybody who wants to come with me?

12
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:28.233
Boss calm down

13
00:00:28.766 --> 00:00:31.766
Even the Blood Gang was wiped out by me, not just at 7:30

14
00:00:31.766 --> 00:00:33.000
What's there to be afraid of?

15
00:00:33.133 --> 00:00:34.600
Boss, 7:30

16
00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.300
It can't be compared to a small blood gang

17
00:00:37.533 --> 00:00:38.966
Want to get rid of them

18
00:00:38.966 --> 00:00:40.633
We have to think long term.

19
00:00:40.666 --> 00:00:42.400
Boss, I'm going with you

20
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:43.966
They certainly wouldn't dare

21
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.433
Do you think everyone is like you?

22
00:00:46.666 --> 00:00:48.133
Boss 7:30

23
00:00:48.133 --> 00:00:50.466
But it has existed since the establishment of the park

24
00:00:50.466 --> 00:00:51.733
Not only are there many of them

25
00:00:51.733 --> 00:00:53.900
And I heard that their president is a lunatic

26
00:00:54.533 --> 00:00:56.900
Oh, you mustn't be so reckless!

27
00:00:56.933 --> 00:01:00.133
Oh, aunts, calm down

28
00:01:00.133 --> 00:01:01.800
So what do you say?

29
00:01:02.466 --> 00:01:04.800
Boss, look inside our group

30
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.866
Only you and Yan Fang can fight

31
00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.166
We may seem crowded

32
00:01:09.466 --> 00:01:11.566
But it lacks sharp combat power

33
00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:14.366
If you get into a fight with someone else

34
00:01:15.333 --> 00:01:16.366
Yes.

35
00:01:17.366 --> 00:01:19.333
Boss, what are we doing here?

36
00:01:19.333 --> 00:01:21.666
Are you on vacation?

37
00:01:21.666 --> 00:01:23.366
I have prepared a period of time for everyone

38
00:01:23.366 --> 00:01:24.966
A month of devil training

39
00:01:25.533 --> 00:01:26.433
Devil Training

40
00:01:27.466 --> 00:01:29.700
Everybody runs 20 laps.

41
00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.466
Runway I know you are the devil 30 laps
