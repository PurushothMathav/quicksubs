00:00:00.933 --> 00:00:04.766
Hey, you can let him go now

2
00:00:07.766 --> 00:00:09.100
Boss Shen Qingyan

3
00:00:09.566 --> 00:00:11.133
Now that you admit defeat

4
00:00:11.133 --> 00:00:13.700
Meet our people at 7:30 in the future

5
00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:14.966
Just take a detour

6
00:00:14.966 --> 00:00:16.366
President Jiang

7
00:00:16.533 --> 00:00:17.900
We're leaving now.

8
00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:18.900
No opinion?

9
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:19.833
roll

10
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:21.366
Go home

11
00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:24.000
Boss don't touch me

12
00:00:27.366 --> 00:00:28.800
Sorry boss

13
00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:30.700
We do it all

14
00:00:30.733 --> 00:00:33.066
It's all because of me that you lost

15
00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.366
Sorry yeah boss

16
00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:37.633
What are you doing?

17
00:00:37.666 --> 00:00:38.800
Kneel down with the boss

18
00:00:39.466 --> 00:00:40.300
Don't kneel

19
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.000
Get up.

20
00:00:46.166 --> 00:00:47.333
I'll tell you what.

21
00:00:47.333 --> 00:00:50.000
I'm on my knees because I didn't plan it well

22
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.700
Let you suffer all this

23
00:00:52.366 --> 00:00:53.766
From Now On

24
00:00:53.766 --> 00:00:56.200
I will never let this happen again

25
00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:58.566
Come on.

26
00:01:01.333 --> 00:01:02.133
Shen Qingyan

27
00:01:05.066 --> 00:01:07.066
Is Xinhui able to help you remove the air cushion?

28
00:01:10.666 --> 00:01:12.466
Oh, what a pity.

29
00:01:12.466 --> 00:01:15.566
Some people are destined to stand at the top of the pyramid

30
00:01:16.166 --> 00:01:16.966
Come on.

31
00:01:19.133 --> 00:01:21.366
Boss, let's eat something

32
00:01:21.366 --> 00:01:23.333
It's ok, I'm not hungry.

33
00:01:23.333 --> 00:01:26.166
The boss blames me, I will definitely exercise well next time

34
00:01:26.166 --> 00:01:28.233
I won't hold you back anymore.

35
00:01:29.466 --> 00:01:31.000
It's okay, it's not your fault.

36
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.166
You're fine

37
00:01:32.166 --> 00:01:34.700
Okay, Qile, stop talking, boss

38
00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.100
What do we do after that?

39
00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.166
The plan remains unchanged

40
00:01:39.166 --> 00:01:41.766
Eradicate 7:30 Domination SM
