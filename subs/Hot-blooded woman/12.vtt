00:00:00.566 --> 00:00:02.966
Sit. This is yours

2
00:00:02.966 --> 00:00:04.566
Just a little money

3
00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:07.166
It will be our pond in the future.

4
00:00:10.466 --> 00:00:11.833
Come on boss

5
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.000
This is what the average person can afford

6
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.500
Ouch boss

7
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:20.600
This is SM.

8
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:22.400
You don't know.

9
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.066
The restaurant run by the inspection team

10
00:00:24.066 --> 00:00:26.400
A dish costs an ordinary person half a year's salary

11
00:00:27.566 --> 00:00:28.966
Evil capitalism

12
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.266
What a loss!

13
00:00:30.266 --> 00:00:32.366
There are also ordinary people working in this restaurant

14
00:00:32.366 --> 00:00:34.033
The salary is quite high

15
00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.000
Is there still a shortage of people in your family?

16
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.933
Oh, where is this?

17
00:00:37.933 --> 00:00:39.633
Boss, if you need money

18
00:00:39.966 --> 00:00:41.433
Tell me no.

19
00:00:41.466 --> 00:00:44.233
Doesn't that mean I'm charging you for protection?

20
00:00:46.666 --> 00:00:49.166
Hey, I'm going to push it. Why is the serving so slow today?

21
00:00:54.466 --> 00:00:55.800
You don't have eyes?

22
00:00:55.933 --> 00:00:57.766
Throw me all over the accounting to death

23
00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:59.100
Excuse me?

24
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.433
Problems with our service

25
00:01:00.533 --> 00:01:02.300
I apologize to you for that.

26
00:01:04.133 --> 00:01:05.400
Who the hell are you?

27
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.966
Do you have the right to speak?

28
00:01:06.966 --> 00:01:09.466
Sorry. I'll give you a free order.

29
00:01:09.566 --> 00:01:12.166
That doesn't work, and I have to pay for my clothes.

30
00:01:12.166 --> 00:01:14.000
100,000 bring it

31
00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.966
Your dress costs 100,000

32
00:01:15.966 --> 00:01:18.000
Why do you look down on me?

33
00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.800
Stop Shen Qingyan

34
00:01:20.666 --> 00:01:22.566
Hey! What are you doing here?

35
00:01:23.066 --> 00:01:25.000
Why are you working as a waiter here?
