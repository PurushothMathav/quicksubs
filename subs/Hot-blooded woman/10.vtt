1
00:00:00.566 --> 00:00:02.533
Then let's decide the outcome

2
00:00:02.533 --> 00:00:04.033
You decide what to play

3
00:00:04.066 --> 00:00:05.700
Don't worry, I'm here.

4
00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.000
No one dares to play tricks

5
00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:10.800
Okay

6
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.866
If you come any later, I'll be beaten to death by them.

7
00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:16.666
If you lose

8
00:00:16.666 --> 00:00:19.400
What does disbanding like this help you wishful thinking?

9
00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:20.900
You thought I would fall for you

10
00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:22.633
What to play

11
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.300
If I lose

12
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.433
To kill to cut

13
00:00:25.733 --> 00:00:29.700
Whatever you want, you're new here, you really say it

14
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:30.533
Horses are hard to chase

15
00:00:30.533 --> 00:00:31.333
OK

16
00:00:32.066 --> 00:00:33.000
Just play

17
00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:39.866
A little hahaha

18
00:00:39.866 --> 00:00:41.366
This is not a fool, is it?

19
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.166
Five sieves are at least 5 points

20
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.566
I'm dying of laughter

21
00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.200
If you dare not drive

22
00:00:48.533 --> 00:00:50.233
Then I'll help you open it.
