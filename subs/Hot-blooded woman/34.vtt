00:00:00.466 --> 00:00:01.933
Captain Song doesn't know

2
00:00:01.933 --> 00:00:02.966
Before you

3
00:00:02.966 --> 00:00:05.433
But you're not the only one who said that to me.

4
00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:07.200
I'm not like them.

5
00:00:07.366 --> 00:00:10.300
They recruit troops, buy horses, grab territory and do bad things

6
00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.300
And I need people to do good deeds

7
00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:14.100
Xiao Ming

8
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:16.266
You heard about the poverty list, right?

9
00:00:16.266 --> 00:00:17.066
Ah!

10
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.200
Heard about it but

11
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:19.666
like

12
00:00:19.666 --> 00:00:22.366
The money hasn't reached the poor yet, has it?

13
00:00:22.366 --> 00:00:23.466
and

14
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.933
I also heard some things about Captain Song in the past

15
00:00:26.933 --> 00:00:29.166
The money will be sent out soon.

16
00:00:29.166 --> 00:00:31.366
I used to be young and ignorant

17
00:00:31.366 --> 00:00:33.500
I have indeed done some ridiculous things

18
00:00:33.966 --> 00:00:37.700
But this time I'm back to atone for my sins

19
00:00:38.133 --> 00:00:40.000
I'll see won't I.

20
00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.500
I heard you want to dominate SM

21
00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:45.400
And I want to take all the organizations of DSM

22
00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.466
Give everyone a quiet atmosphere

23
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.500
And do what you can to help those in need

24
00:00:50.533 --> 00:00:54.166
Don't we have no advantage if we join forces?

25
00:00:54.566 --> 00:00:56.866
Then you disband your inspection team

26
00:00:56.966 --> 00:00:58.766
Although it is called the Inspectorate

27
00:00:58.766 --> 00:01:02.166
But he Shi Xin will meet the blood gang at 7:30

28
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:03.800
It doesn't make any difference

29
00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.700
I can't disband the inspectorate yet

30
00:01:06.866 --> 00:01:09.800
Because what I'm going to do needs some people

31
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.900
Oh so

32
00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.466
How can I trust you, Hugh Zero?

33
00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.166
This is 200,000

34
00:01:24.166 --> 00:01:26.200
Enough for you to enjoy for a while

35
00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:27.400
What do you mean?

36
00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.866
What do I mean? Don't you understand?

37
00:01:29.866 --> 00:01:31.766
That's power.

38
00:01:31.766 --> 00:01:33.366
It's what I pay you.

39
00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.200
As long as you join the inspectorate

40
00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:38.233
I can give you everything you want

41
00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:41.700
As expected of Captain Song

42
00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.533
It's so generous

43
00:01:44.533 --> 00:01:46.800
You look down on me too much
