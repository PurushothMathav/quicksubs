00:00:01.933 --> 00:00:04.066
So we have a chance to become celebrities too?

3
00:00:04.066 --> 00:00:05.400
Wow thanks captain

4
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.200
Yes, otherwise you think I pay

5
00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:10.166
To help you join the Inspectorate

6
00:00:10.166 --> 00:00:11.500
Is it for poverty alleviation?

7
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:12.400
No.

8
00:00:12.666 --> 00:00:15.266
I want to give you a better future

9
00:00:15.266 --> 00:00:17.200
Captain, what about the others?

10
00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.000
They will also make arrangements

11
00:00:20.766 --> 00:00:22.766
I will customize each person according to their different characteristics.

12
00:00:22.766 --> 00:00:23.866
Make arrangements

13
00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.666
For example, some people are suitable for finance

14
00:00:26.666 --> 00:00:28.400
Some people are fit to be teachers

15
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.966
Some people are fit to be athletes wow

16
00:00:30.966 --> 00:00:32.666
Captain is really nice

17
00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.400
You two used to be 316.

18
00:00:35.933 --> 00:00:37.666
Shen Qingyan's people

19
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.433
But didn't they take refuge in Song Qiuci?

20
00:00:42.533 --> 00:00:43.900
Hey, I understand.

21
00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:45.133
Money is really important

22
00:00:45.133 --> 00:00:48.600
Song Qiuci must have known that they used to be your people

23
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.733
They are likely to be suspected of being undercover

24
00:00:50.733 --> 00:00:52.633
Aren't they dangerous?

25
00:00:53.066 --> 00:00:55.266
Oh but I know

26
00:00:55.266 --> 00:00:58.166
Song Qiuci would definitely believe them
