00:00:05.666 --> 00:00:08.400
What about the lady? The lady just took a taxi and left

2
00:00:09.333 --> 00:00:10.566
Why didn't you stop him?

3
00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:12.000
I can't stop it.

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.433
But I did get the license plate number.

5
00:00:15.866 --> 00:00:18.000
Mom, I'm married!

6
00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:22.100
I was married to a man who didn't love me for three years

7
00:00:22.966 --> 00:00:24.500
In fact, I understand in my heart

8
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.766
He married me for the kids

9
00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.033
But I don't know what's wrong

10
00:00:29.066 --> 00:00:30.400
I saw him with other women

11
00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:31.866
When hugging each other

12
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:34.066
I'm really sick inside

13
00:00:34.766 --> 00:00:37.866
Maybe I started from the beginning

14
00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:40.433
You shouldn't have unrealistic fantasies

15
00:00:40.933 --> 00:00:43.400
He and I are not from the same world at all

16
00:00:45.266 --> 00:00:47.566
Mom, it's raining.

17
00:00:47.866 --> 00:00:49.400
I'll see you next time.

18
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:55.166
How are you?

19
00:00:55.933 --> 00:00:58.500
Senior, why are you here?

20
00:00:58.733 --> 00:01:00.433
I originally went to Lu Enterprises to negotiate a contract

21
00:01:00.533 --> 00:01:02.266
Watching you run out of the Lu Enterprises building

22
00:01:02.266 --> 00:01:03.566
I'm afraid something will happen to you.

23
00:01:03.566 --> 00:01:04.700
I followed

24
00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:05.900
I didn't expect you to be

25
00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:07.666
I'm sorry, sir

26
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.566
I always let you see my place

27
00:01:09.566 --> 00:01:11.166
You look embarrassed.

28
00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:12.266
While going to school

29
00:01:12.266 --> 00:01:13.466
I let you see me a lot

30
00:01:13.466 --> 00:01:14.766
You look embarrassed.

31
00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.666
It's even, right?

32
00:01:19.966 --> 00:01:20.533
How have you been?

33
00:01:20.533 --> 00:01:22.400
Can you go and I will carry you?

34
00:01:25.566 --> 00:01:27.100
This is for fear of being secretly photographed by paparazzi

35
00:01:27.333 --> 00:01:29.400
So they all went to the cemetery for a date

36
00:01:32.533 --> 00:01:33.566
Why are you here?
