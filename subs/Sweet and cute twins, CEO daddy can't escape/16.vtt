00:00:01.733 --> 00:00:04.066
Ji, what are you doing here?

2
00:00:04.066 --> 00:00:06.200
Mom, don't blame your brother.

3
00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:08.500
I asked my brother to come

4
00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:11.133
Mom, I'm coming.

5
00:00:11.133 --> 00:00:13.000
It has nothing to do with my sister

6
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.200
Do your family know?

7
00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.466
Mom, let's have dinner with my brother at home

8
00:00:20.566 --> 00:00:22.966
Hey, you will act like a spoiled child

9
00:00:22.966 --> 00:00:24.466
If my son is still alive

10
00:00:24.466 --> 00:00:26.833
It should be as smart and cute as him

11
00:00:26.966 --> 00:00:28.366
Let's go Xiaojing

12
00:00:35.466 --> 00:00:36.600
What's wrong with you?

13
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.800
Bad aunt bad aunt

14
00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:41.166
Does it hurt?

15
00:00:41.166 --> 00:00:42.833
Auntie will give you a blow.

16
00:00:44.466 --> 00:00:46.200
Mom, you are so kind.

17
00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:48.900
I'm not your mother.

18
00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.466
You and Xixi eat first?

19
00:00:51.466 --> 00:00:53.000
Auntie make a call

20
00:01:04.266 --> 00:01:05.433
Road courtyard?

21
00:01:05.466 --> 00:01:06.966
Your child is at my house.

22
00:01:11.333 --> 00:01:12.133
Lucy

23
00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:13.933
You're capable now, aren't you?

24
00:01:13.933 --> 00:01:14.966
Running away from home at every turn

25
00:01:14.966 --> 00:01:15.800
You do this again

26
00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.500
Believe it or not, I'll send you abroad now

27
00:01:17.933 --> 00:01:19.266
Why are you so cruel to children?

28
00:01:19.266 --> 00:01:20.866
He's only 5 years old and doesn't know anything

29
00:01:20.866 --> 00:01:23.100
And you didn't even ask him.

30
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.066
And threatened to go abroad

31
00:01:24.066 --> 00:01:25.133
Are you such a father?

32
00:01:25.133 --> 00:01:27.566
I said your dad

33
00:01:27.566 --> 00:01:30.566
Don't worship little brother

34
00:01:31.566 --> 00:01:32.600
kid

35
00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.300
Oops come here

36
00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:36.766
He's not your father

37
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.400
What about your daughter's father?

38
00:01:39.166 --> 00:01:41.266
What does my daughter's father have to do with you?

39
00:01:41.266 --> 00:01:43.533
Let's talk about petty things

40
00:01:43.533 --> 00:01:46.100
Stingy, he has a wound on his arm
