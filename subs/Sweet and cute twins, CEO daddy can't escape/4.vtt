1
00:00:01.333 --> 00:00:04.666
Brother, Mommy and I finally found you.

2
00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:06.433
He is not a brother

3
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.500
But we look alike

4
00:00:10.766 --> 00:00:12.000
Yes, he does.

5
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.966
But how can there be such a coincidence in this world?

6
00:00:14.966 --> 00:00:17.800
Children, what about your adults?

7
00:00:21.466 --> 00:00:22.433
Mom?

8
00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:27.933
Mom looks better than in the photo, kid

9
00:00:27.933 --> 00:00:30.866
If you don't talk to your aunt, how can your aunt help you?

10
00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:34.966
Mom, can't brother speak?

11
00:00:40.966 --> 00:00:42.966
You are writing dad's phone number.

12
00:00:44.166 --> 00:00:46.300
Do you have mom's phone number?

13
00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.066
Your child is seeing a quick call back from me now.

14
00:01:01.366 --> 00:01:03.066
Withdraw the TV station's missing person notice

15
00:01:03.133 --> 00:01:05.166
Message from the person who kidnapped the chick

16
00:01:05.166 --> 00:01:06.900
Did Faye Wong say how much ransom she wanted?

17
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.000
No matter how much

18
00:01:08.066 --> 00:01:09.666
I must redeem the chick
