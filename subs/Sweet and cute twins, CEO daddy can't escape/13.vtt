00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:03.500
It was a stillborn baby, remember?

2
00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:05.766
Impossible Impossible

3
00:00:05.866 --> 00:00:07.600
Sister maybe

4
00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:10.500
He is because of a biological mother like you

5
00:00:10.866 --> 00:00:12.200
feel ashamed

6
00:00:13.766 --> 00:00:14.566
court month

7
00:00:14.866 --> 00:00:17.366
It just so happens that I specially made soup for you today and delivered it here.

8
00:00:17.733 --> 00:00:18.666
Oh, right.

9
00:00:18.933 --> 00:00:21.633
My parents also asked about our marriage. We'll talk about it later.

10
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.900
Haotingyue, don't be angry

11
00:00:26.166 --> 00:00:28.400
My parents didn't mean to rush us

12
00:00:28.466 --> 00:00:29.700
Let's go have soup first

13
00:00:38.466 --> 00:00:40.400
The child holds the child and returns it to me.

14
00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:43.900
Give it back to me because my mother didn't protect you well

15
00:00:48.133 --> 00:00:49.700
What happened to the stillborn baby?

16
00:00:50.333 --> 00:00:52.600
That was born to my sister and a wild man outside

17
00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.833
Wild species are congenitally deficient

18
00:00:54.933 --> 00:00:57.500
Born dead, right?

19
00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.733
Mom, that bitch is not only still alive

20
00:01:03.733 --> 00:01:06.300
And he also became a senior designer of Lu Group

21
00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:07.533
What are you in a hurry

22
00:01:07.533 --> 00:01:09.366
You are now Lu Ji's mother

23
00:01:09.366 --> 00:01:11.166
Or Lu Qunyue's fiancee

24
00:01:11.166 --> 00:01:13.633
What can that little bitch do?

25
00:01:13.733 --> 00:01:16.466
But that little bastard Lu Ji never recognized me

26
00:01:16.466 --> 00:01:18.466
Since that little bastard is disobedient

27
00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.500
When you are pregnant with Lu Tingyue's child

28
00:01:20.566 --> 00:01:21.966
Just take you little bastard

29
00:01:21.966 --> 00:01:24.033
Get rid of it with that little bitch

30
00:01:24.866 --> 00:01:28.066
But the courtyard never gave me a chance to get close to him

31
00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.500
Don't give a chance

32
00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.300
Then create opportunities
