00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:03.033
Does Lu Tingyue know?

2
00:00:03.533 --> 00:00:05.066
I didn't dare tell him.

3
00:00:06.466 --> 00:00:08.866
If I die, he marries another woman

4
00:00:08.866 --> 00:00:10.500
What will happen to my child?

5
00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:12.000
So you are afraid

6
00:00:12.533 --> 00:00:14.233
If you have a stepmother, you will have a stepfather

7
00:00:14.366 --> 00:00:16.366
The two children are not treated fairly

8
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.100
So I want to live while I'm still alive

9
00:00:18.133 --> 00:00:20.166
Get more benefits for your children, right?

10
00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.366
In fact, I don't think you need to raise enough

11
00:00:23.566 --> 00:00:24.966
I think Lu Tingyue

12
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.433
He treats you differently.

13
00:00:26.866 --> 00:00:28.700
He must have something for you

14
00:00:29.866 --> 00:00:31.000
It's sincere.

15
00:00:31.133 --> 00:00:32.266
I can't bet.

16
00:00:32.733 --> 00:00:34.466
I dare not bet on anyone's sincerity

17
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:35.766
Not to mention

18
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.833
It is still the sincerity of the first person in power in Jiangcheng

19
00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:41.566
You are still as stubborn as ever

20
00:00:41.933 --> 00:00:43.200
So what are you going to do?

21
00:00:43.466 --> 00:00:44.566
Negotiate with him

22
00:00:47.366 --> 00:00:49.566
Lu Tingyue, I want to talk to you

23
00:00:49.966 --> 00:00:51.333
What's the matter?

24
00:00:51.333 --> 00:00:54.033
I want to tell you about the agreement

25
00:00:55.166 --> 00:00:57.433
What do you want to say, you and me?

26
00:01:01.466 --> 00:01:03.000
Hello, Mom.

27
00:01:05.966 --> 00:01:07.233
OK, I see.

28
00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.600
We'll talk about the agreement later

29
00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.066
The day after tomorrow is my aunt's birthday.

30
00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:13.200
You get ready

31
00:01:14.366 --> 00:01:16.266
