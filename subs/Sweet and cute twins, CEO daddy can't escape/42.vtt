00:00:02.566 --> 00:00:04.266
Come and eat more

2
00:00:05.266 --> 00:00:07.066
I heard from the courtyard

3
00:00:07.166 --> 00:00:09.566
Are you the biological mother of the subtotal?

4
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.866
He even gave birth to a daughter

5
00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.066
Having both children is a good thing

6
00:00:16.066 --> 00:00:17.700
After this while

7
00:00:17.733 --> 00:00:19.166
By the end of the year

8
00:00:19.166 --> 00:00:21.166
I asked him to make up your wedding

9
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.866
No, the courtyard is so busy with work every day

10
00:00:23.866 --> 00:00:25.266
I don't want to bother him either

11
00:00:25.366 --> 00:00:28.566
And I'm not the form-oriented type.

12
00:00:28.566 --> 00:00:29.466
How can that work?

13
00:00:29.466 --> 00:00:32.133
Wouldn't it be wronged if you didn't hold a wedding?

14
00:00:32.133 --> 00:00:32.933
courtyard

15
00:00:33.566 --> 00:00:35.066
You're married now, too?

16
00:00:35.066 --> 00:00:38.633
Can you call your brother and his family back?

17
00:00:39.166 --> 00:00:42.033
Mom, don't say that again

18
00:00:45.066 --> 00:00:47.166
Oh, I'm sorry.

19
00:00:47.166 --> 00:00:48.200
I didn't mean to.

20
00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.066
It's okay, I'll deal with it.

21
00:00:50.066 --> 00:00:51.266
I'll go with you.

22
00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:59.200
I advise you to divorce the courtyard as soon as possible

23
00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.000
He doesn't love you at all

24
00:01:01.933 --> 00:01:04.400
What does the second sister-in-law mean by this?

25
00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.666
It turned out that you were the one who climbed into the courtyard bed back then?

26
00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.400
You are more sophisticated than you want.

27
00:01:10.466 --> 00:01:12.966
He hasn't entered the Lu family's door for five years

28
00:01:12.966 --> 00:01:13.766
Second sister-in-law

29
00:01:13.966 --> 00:01:16.700
If that's what you came to me today to say

30
00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:17.900
Then I will not accompany you

31
00:01:19.933 --> 00:01:21.533
Don't you want to know

32
00:01:21.533 --> 00:01:25.033
What made you climb into the courtyard bed back then?

33
00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.300
It's because my eldest brother wants to be with the court

34
00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:29.600
The court grabs the position of the heir

35
00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.800
His stupid son wants to drug

36
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.200
So that I, the widow of a recently deceased husband

37
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.666
Delivered to the bed in the courtyard

38
00:01:35.666 --> 00:01:38.366
Take a picture of our bed and hype it up

39
00:01:38.766 --> 00:01:41.000
And you know why he did it?

40
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.233
Because I am Tingyue's first love

41
00:01:44.366 --> 00:01:47.100
If it weren't for Tingyue going abroad that year

42
00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:47.933
I married him.

43
00:01:47.933 --> 00:01:49.766
Second brother, do you think

44
00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.800
Why can you enter the Lu family's door?

45
00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.966
So you stay in the Lu family as a widow

46
00:01:53.966 --> 00:01:55.766
Not for Lu Tingyue's nursery rhymes

47
00:01:55.766 --> 00:01:58.400
But to win Lu Tingyue's heart

48
00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.833
The heart of the courtyard has always been on me

49
00:02:01.933 --> 00:02:03.666
Since it is as you said

50
00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.133
You shouldn't tell me about the divorce

51
00:02:06.133 --> 00:02:07.700
You should tell Lu Tingyue

52
00:02:07.766 --> 00:02:09.166
If he agrees

53
00:02:09.166 --> 00:02:10.566
Then of course I will sign

54
00:02:10.666 --> 00:02:11.600
how

55
00:02:12.266 --> 00:02:13.466
You dare not say

56
00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:17.100
Don't be shameless.
