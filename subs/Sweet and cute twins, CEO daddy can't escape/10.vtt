1
00:00:01.166 --> 00:00:02.600
Don't go too far.

2
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.033
I see

3
00:00:14.566 --> 00:00:16.900
I heard that our Mr. Lu is not married yet

4
00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.466
He's not married yet

5
00:00:19.566 --> 00:00:21.366
There can be no secret

6
00:00:21.733 --> 00:00:24.566
I heard people say he doesn't like women

7
00:00:24.733 --> 00:00:28.100
I also raised an extra Lehe, you wait for the brothers

8
00:00:30.933 --> 00:00:34.366
Could it be that President Lu is the one who supports him?

9
00:00:39.066 --> 00:00:40.600
Now that we have found Lu Enterprises' headquarters

10
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:41.566
You think you saved Xiao

11
00:00:41.566 --> 00:00:43.066
Can you approach me at any time?

12
00:00:43.066 --> 00:00:44.866
I'm here for an interview, okay?

13
00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:47.066
Besides, are you hard to approach?

14
00:00:47.066 --> 00:00:48.466
It's not okay to have money

15
00:00:48.466 --> 00:00:50.200
Make it seem like you are so precious

16
00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:51.633
You are here for an interview

17
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.600
This is your festival

18
00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:57.500
Of course, yeah.

19
00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.133
Are you here for the interview too?

20
00:01:00.133 --> 00:01:01.566
I advise you.

21
00:01:01.766 --> 00:01:02.800
Forget it.

22
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.433
No play why

23
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.800
I think your work level is very high

24
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.700
Because the senior designer of Lu Group

25
00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.666
It's not professional at all

26
00:01:11.666 --> 00:01:13.700
See who gives more red envelopes.

27
00:01:18.533 --> 00:01:20.966
All bribes to staff and bribes

28
00:01:20.966 --> 00:01:22.266
All blacklisted

29
00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:23.333
From Now On

30
00:01:23.333 --> 00:01:25.966
All industries in Jiangcheng will never be hired

31
00:01:25.966 --> 00:01:27.933
It's Mr. Lu

32
00:01:27.933 --> 00:01:29.000
Senior fashion designer

33
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.033
Do you always need to re-open the recruitment? Record him
