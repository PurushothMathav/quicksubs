00:00:01.366 --> 00:00:05.000
Once upon a time, there was a kind and lovely little prince

2
00:00:05.133 --> 00:00:08.900
He lives alone on a tiny planet

3
00:00:09.066 --> 00:00:10.300
One day

4
00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:12.600
He came across a bunch of roses

5
00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:16.500
And so he became friends with the rose.

6
00:00:16.866 --> 00:00:17.766
So what happened?

7
00:00:17.766 --> 00:00:21.733
He watered the rose every day, mother

8
00:00:21.733 --> 00:00:26.000
But did the little prince finally return to his planet?

9
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.433
Have you seen his rose?

10
00:00:28.466 --> 00:00:30.366
I saw my mother.

11
00:00:30.366 --> 00:00:32.400
The little prince is on earth

12
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.900
What should I do if I find good friends?

13
00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:38.000
So they'll never see the little prince again?

14
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.733
As long as you keep each other in your heart

15
00:00:40.733 --> 00:00:41.833
Will definitely meet

16
00:00:43.066 --> 00:00:45.566
Let's not separate

17
00:00:46.133 --> 00:00:48.566
Kiki is so wronged

18
00:00:48.666 --> 00:00:50.166
I really want to be with my dad

19
00:00:50.166 --> 00:00:53.766
Mom and brother have been living together

20
00:00:53.933 --> 00:00:57.666
Me too. Don't worry.

21
00:00:57.666 --> 00:01:00.266
Mom won't leave you

22
00:01:02.466 --> 00:01:04.166
Ok go to bed early

23
00:01:04.166 --> 00:01:05.433
School tomorrow.

24
00:01:11.533 --> 00:01:12.700
You go to the kitchen

25
00:01:26.733 --> 00:01:28.833
Why didn't you tell me you had cancer?
