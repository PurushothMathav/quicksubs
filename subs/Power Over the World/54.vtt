00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:02.700
I promised to make him a contract

2
00:00:02.866 --> 00:00:04.633
It really is my greatest achievement.

3
00:00:04.866 --> 00:00:07.766
How to answer this question? Is it difficult?

4
00:00:07.866 --> 00:00:11.300
Or did I say something on my mind?

5
00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:12.766
Even if you guess

6
00:00:13.566 --> 00:00:15.066
Ah, in this young master

7
00:00:15.066 --> 00:00:17.566
After getting the order from the Universal Chamber of Commerce

8
00:00:17.566 --> 00:00:20.300
I am even more solid in the Xiao family

9
00:00:20.333 --> 00:00:21.666
Even if grandpa knew the truth

10
00:00:21.666 --> 00:00:24.100
He won't support you saying that either

11
00:00:25.733 --> 00:00:27.866
So you can't save my mother if she dies

12
00:00:27.866 --> 00:00:28.766
Willing, right?

13
00:00:30.466 --> 00:00:31.266
Ye Longyuan

14
00:00:33.866 --> 00:00:34.933
You get out of here.

15
00:00:34.933 --> 00:00:37.700
The truth of some things no longer matters

16
00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:39.700
Today, in addition to the relocation project of the building

17
00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:41.033
And the Lord appeared

18
00:00:41.266 --> 00:00:43.400
You are looking for yourself here

19
00:00:44.133 --> 00:00:45.400
I will explain to God

20
00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:46.633
Get his forgiveness

21
00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:48.000
Even if you can't be a prince

22
00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.566
Even if I stay by the Lord God's side and be a handmaid

23
00:00:50.733 --> 00:00:52.200
Better than being your wife

24
00:00:52.533 --> 00:00:55.500
My Lin family can also soar into the sky

25
00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.066
skyrocket

26
00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:59.800
Everything is inclusive of your pig brain

27
00:01:00.133 --> 00:01:02.900
Why did God violate your Lin family?

28
00:01:02.933 --> 00:01:04.200
How about your cow?

29
00:01:04.766 --> 00:01:07.400
You are really blinded by the world right now

30
00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.333
You do everything for the world

31
00:01:09.333 --> 00:01:10.866
Miracle Yale Ren

32
00:01:10.966 --> 00:01:13.500
This is what I look down on you the most

33
00:01:13.533 --> 00:01:14.733
You are incompetent trash

34
00:01:14.733 --> 00:01:17.266
But still guarding your poor self-esteem

35
00:01:17.366 --> 00:01:18.933
As long as I can get the project

36
00:01:18.933 --> 00:01:20.800
What if I give everything

37
00:01:21.466 --> 00:01:23.333
But Anzhi has great ambitions

38
00:01:23.333 --> 00:01:26.566
You and I are not of the same class, you don't understand

39
00:01:28.333 --> 00:01:31.233
Well said, well said

40
00:01:31.566 --> 00:01:34.433
Because I'm really not a rhythm person.

41
00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.066
Not the same

42
00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.966
So your Lin family can't get this project.

43
00:01:38.966 --> 00:01:40.300
I said
