1
00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.500
Cancel the Dragon Gate Banquet

2
00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:02.966
Why is that?

3
00:00:02.966 --> 00:00:03.766
We owe

4
00:00:03.766 --> 00:00:05.066
Did nothing wrong

5
00:00:05.066 --> 00:00:07.200
I don't agree with why it is cancelled if you say it is cancelled.

6
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:11.933
What are you?

7
00:00:11.933 --> 00:00:14.300
This king's turn to speak, it's your turn to interject

8
00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:17.833
Chen Shaojie, you are the only one in the whole city, right?

9
00:00:18.266 --> 00:00:19.800
Are you masochistic?

10
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.033
Operate, you wait for me.

11
00:00:22.333 --> 00:00:23.300
Lord Holy King

12
00:00:23.333 --> 00:00:25.800
Why cancel my Lin family's Longmen canonization banquet?

13
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:27.800
We shouldn't have done anything to make God Rat

14
00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.000
Angry things

15
00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:30.533
Are you really sure?

16
00:00:30.533 --> 00:00:31.566
I'm pretty sure of it.

17
00:00:32.066 --> 00:00:33.166
The Lord has not yet arrived

18
00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:34.266
Besides, we can't

19
00:00:34.266 --> 00:00:35.966
Do anything that makes him angry

20
00:00:36.166 --> 00:00:37.666
The chair has nothing to do with us

21
00:00:37.666 --> 00:00:38.933
It was made by Ye Longyuan

22
00:00:38.933 --> 00:00:40.400
Who says the Lord has not arrived?

23
00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.166
The Lord has already arrived

24
00:00:42.266 --> 00:00:45.366
What god has already arrived

25
00:00:47.066 --> 00:00:49.366
It's impossible that we haven't seen the Lord God

26
00:00:49.366 --> 00:00:50.300
Lord Holy King

27
00:00:50.333 --> 00:00:51.533
We ask ourselves.

28
00:00:51.533 --> 00:00:53.800
Did nothing to make the Lord God angry

29
00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:56.300
You know what you did.

30
00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.666
Now it is a godsend that the judge does not condemn sin

31
00:00:59.666 --> 00:01:01.100
It's up to you to ask

32
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.200
No, Lord Saint King, don't go

33
00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.533
If we do something wrong

34
00:01:04.533 --> 00:01:05.600
We can apologize.

35
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.766
Please forgive me, Lord God

36
00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:10.466
Pay attention to your behavior

37
00:01:10.733 --> 00:01:12.633
Otherwise, the door will be cut off

38
00:01:12.733 --> 00:01:13.400
Lord Holy King

39
00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.766
We are willing to pay for your forgiveness
