Send some congratulations

3
00:00:04.466 --> 00:00:05.833
Congratulations to Miss Lin

4
00:00:05.866 --> 00:00:08.966
Hmph, this lamp was sent from Ye Longyuan

00:00:12.866 --> 00:00:15.000
They're priceless.

9
00:00:15.333 --> 00:00:18.266
The worst thousand-year-old Jinsi Nanmu River

10
00:00:18.266 --> 00:00:19.666
Also worth millions

11
00:00:19.666 --> 00:00:23.166
How about this gift?

12
00:00:23.166 --> 00:00:25.066
Are you sure this is from him?

13
00:00:25.066 --> 00:00:26.200
I don't know him.

14
00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:27.200
Gift has been delivered.

15
00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.700
My mission is complete.

16
00:00:38.466 --> 00:00:40.933
Hahaha, I'll just say it.

17
00:00:40.933 --> 00:00:42.766
A three-year-old loser

18
00:00:42.766 --> 00:00:44.800
How could he possibly afford such an expensive gift?

19
00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.400
Yue Longyuan, you really let me down

20
00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:49.500
Blinded by the corpse

21
00:00:49.566 --> 00:00:53.133
Our neighbor is really going to take off, haha.

22
00:00:53.133 --> 00:00:56.366
Even foreign chambers of commerce have sent such a generous gift

23
00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:57.566
young sister

24
00:00:57.566 --> 00:01:00.300
Your Chen family has lifted a lot of weight in foreign chambers of commerce

25
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.900
Is this congratulatory gift not the suggestion of the Chen family?

26
00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.266
Could it be a surprise from my father?

27
00:01:06.366 --> 00:01:07.866
Seal my Lang Family Lin Tianjiao

28
00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:09.766
The parents laughed.

29
00:01:09.766 --> 00:01:11.066
This is what my father prepared

30
00:01:11.066 --> 00:01:13.200
You are so shameless

31
00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.466
These gifts are what I asked the Universal Chamber of Commerce to prepare

32
00:01:16.466 --> 00:01:18.700
The Universal Chamber of Commerce listens to you

33
00:01:18.733 --> 00:01:19.866
Are you going to say it again?

34
00:01:19.866 --> 00:01:21.766
The president of the Universal Chamber of Commerce is you?

35
00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.900
I'm not the president of the Universal Chamber of Commerce

36
00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.833
But the Universal Chamber of Commerce will listen to me

37
00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.100
Let this trash go

38
00:01:29.366 --> 00:01:31.066
President of the International Chamber of Commerce

39
00:01:31.066 --> 00:01:34.866
How many families want to curry favor and others will listen to you

40
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:36.833
Shaojie

41
00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:41.666
This golden nanmu box needs a password to open it.

42
00:01:41.666 --> 00:01:44.433
Do you know what's inside?

43
00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.200
Something given by yourself

44
00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:48.633
Don't you know?

45
00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.033
That was my father's suggestion.

46
00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.966
The congratulatory gift prepared by the president, I don't know, is it strange?

47
00:01:52.966 --> 00:01:53.900
Did you know

48
00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:55.166
Of course I know.

49
00:01:55.166 --> 00:01:57.866
This box contains my Tianmen Kunlun Hall

50
00:01:57.866 --> 00:02:00.000
The banquet is also to be held at this Longmen banquet

51
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.233
Should have given tomorrow the meaning of being in charge
