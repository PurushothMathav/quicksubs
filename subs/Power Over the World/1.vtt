00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.833
Miss, they're catching up

2
00:00:12.533 --> 00:00:14.600
It's so annoying to let you marry the Xiao family

3
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.666
You can't catch Xiao Lin all day long

4
00:00:17.366 --> 00:00:18.833
Sit down

5
00:00:37.566 --> 00:00:38.600
And this word.

6
00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:00.833
Be careful ahead

7
00:01:18.933 --> 00:01:20.566
Won't die

8
00:01:20.566 --> 00:01:23.466
Miss, what should I do now, Miss Fan?

9
00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:24.933
We are also following orders

10
00:01:24.933 --> 00:01:26.500
Please come back with us to meet the master

11
00:01:26.866 --> 00:01:28.766
I don't have time to talk to you right now, so save people first

12
00:01:29.533 --> 00:01:30.533
Sorry, Miss Tang.

13
00:01:30.533 --> 00:01:32.100
Our mission has nothing to do with this

14
00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.033
What the hell is your dog's name?

15
00:01:39.333 --> 00:01:42.100
You got your goddamn driver's license from a dog

16
00:01:45.133 --> 00:01:46.133
Can you drive?

17
00:01:46.133 --> 00:01:48.866
Miss, what's the matter?

18
00:01:49.066 --> 00:01:50.800
He was knocked flying more than ten meters away

19
00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.700
Why is it still like there is nothing wrong?

20
00:01:52.733 --> 00:01:53.800
Let me ask you something.

21
00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:55.666
Did you hit me?

22
00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.033
I'm in a bad mood right now

23
00:01:58.566 --> 00:01:59.633
Give me an explanation

24
00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:02.433
I work at home

25
00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:03.966
Calcium supplement for idle and miscellaneous human head

26
00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:10.500
Are you crazy?

27
00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.366
Or die

28
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.366
This is the top expert of my Tang family

29
00:02:21.533 --> 00:02:23.233
Just follow you for a second?

30
00:02:27.933 --> 00:02:29.633
Sir, we are willing to compensate

31
00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.100
Don't move our lady

32
00:02:32.166 --> 00:02:33.966
Sir, it was an accident just now.

33
00:02:33.966 --> 00:02:35.100
Well, I'll lose money.

34
00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:36.233
As much as you want.

35
00:02:37.733 --> 00:02:39.133
Do I look like someone who is short of money?

36
00:02:39.133 --> 00:02:41.833
Don't tell me that you are the eldest lady of the Tang family.

37
00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.433
Even if your father is Wan Guohao

38
00:02:45.133 --> 00:02:45.866
So be it.

39
00:02:45.866 --> 00:02:48.600
How about I, Tang Miaoying, promise to marry you?

40
00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.766
Get out of here, there's a wife

41
00:02:51.066 --> 00:02:52.400
Hurry up and give me an explanation.

42
00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.066
Don't you want to hand it over?

43
00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:55.700
I promised myself

44
00:02:55.966 --> 00:02:59.000
Not yet, miss. Do you know what you're talking about?

45
00:02:59.866 --> 00:03:02.166
You are sick, do you know who my lady is?

46
00:03:02.166 --> 00:03:03.266
Miss Tang

47
00:03:03.266 --> 00:03:05.466
President of Galaxy Group, how dare you speak like this?

48
00:03:05.466 --> 00:03:06.266
She is sick

49
00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:07.700
My family arranged a marriage for me

50
00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:09.500
I don't like this.

51
00:03:09.533 --> 00:03:11.100
You and I fake marriage

52
00:03:11.533 --> 00:03:13.966
5 million you are sick

53
00:03:13.966 --> 00:03:15.133
Don't say 5 million

54
00:03:15.133 --> 00:03:16.166
You give me 50 million

55
00:03:16.166 --> 00:03:17.700
I would never betray my wife

56
00:03:17.966 --> 00:03:19.000
It's all you

57
00:03:19.766 --> 00:03:20.666
the disease will never be cured

58
00:03:20.866 --> 00:03:22.466
That's tricky

59
00:03:22.466 --> 00:03:23.733
How do you do our lady

60
00:03:23.733 --> 00:03:25.033
It doesn't matter.

61
00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:26.633
Marriage can also be divorced

62
00:03:26.666 --> 00:03:28.066
5 million not enough

63
00:03:28.066 --> 00:03:29.066
I'll give you 10 million

64
00:03:29.066 --> 00:03:29.566
What do you want?

65
00:03:29.566 --> 00:03:31.566
I'm not interested in talking nonsense with you

66
00:03:31.566 --> 00:03:33.066
My wife is still waiting for me at home

67
00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:36.966
Didn't you ask me to explain it to you?

68
00:03:36.966 --> 00:03:39.000
I told you I was sick

69
00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.200
Then I think I'm sick

70
00:03:40.466 --> 00:03:42.233
I'm afraid, you give it.

71
00:03:42.566 --> 00:03:44.300
This medicine can cure your disease

72
00:03:44.366 --> 00:03:47.000
I'm not interested in your deal. Bye

73
00:03:52.066 --> 00:03:53.000
What about people?

74
00:03:54.333 --> 00:03:57.066
Miss, did he just teleport?

75
00:03:57.066 --> 00:03:58.166
What was his name just now?

76
00:03:58.166 --> 00:03:59.666
Ah Ye Longyuan

77
00:03:59.966 --> 00:04:01.200
Check it out immediately

78
00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:02.566
I want all his information

79
00:04:02.566 --> 00:04:05.133
Miss, do you really want to marry him?

80
00:04:05.133 --> 00:04:07.200
Otherwise, marry Xiao Lingtian

81
00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:09.233
Go back and talk to my wife

82
00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:10.900
This is for my husband

83
00:04:12.966 --> 00:04:15.200
Miss, you are sick

84
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.233
Who is sick?

85
00:04:17.466 --> 00:04:18.766
He's sick

86
00:04:18.766 --> 00:04:20.400
Miss Ben is in good health

87
00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.266
I'm actually dead and I won't eat his ok

88
00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:31.900
Ah!

89
00:04:32.366 --> 00:04:34.566
What's the matter, Miss?
