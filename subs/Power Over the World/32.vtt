Dragon Moon

2
00:00:03.333 --> 00:00:04.966
Thank you for picking it up for me just now.

3
00:00:04.966 --> 00:00:07.800
But from today on, you are my man

4
00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.500
I will not allow anyone to bully you

5
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.400
Don't worry about the order.

6
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:14.866
No one dares to rob you

7
00:00:14.866 --> 00:00:15.700
Who robbed

8
00:00:16.366 --> 00:00:17.466
Who died?

9
00:00:19.666 --> 00:00:21.766
Ok I know you are great

10
00:00:21.766 --> 00:00:22.900
No one now

11
00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:23.966
Don't do that.

12
00:00:24.366 --> 00:00:25.833
I'm serious.

13
00:00:25.866 --> 00:00:27.166
I'm serious too

14
00:00:30.166 --> 00:00:31.800
I can handle other things.

15
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.266
But I really can't help it with things like ours.

16
00:00:35.266 --> 00:00:37.266
I have to go home and discuss it with my grandfather

17
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:39.300
fate

18
00:00:39.866 --> 00:00:42.433
Wait for me, don't be impulsive.

19
00:00:43.966 --> 00:00:44.766
OK

20
00:01:11.566 --> 00:01:13.166
I'm not happy with you.

21
00:01:13.166 --> 00:01:15.400
Hold back, my lord, I'll take you to Tianhai Restaurant right away

22
00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.366
Please give me a chance to explain.

23
00:01:31.333 --> 00:01:33.000
Greet the Lord God

24
00:01:33.566 --> 00:01:34.566
Get up.

25
00:01:35.966 --> 00:01:37.200
Lord God

26
00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:38.700
Please hop in.

27
00:02:04.466 --> 00:02:05.600
Ye Longyuan, this waste

28
00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.600
Damn it, I'm running outside at night

29
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.766
Isn't this the motorcade of Wan Guohao, the richest man in the world?

30
00:02:17.766 --> 00:02:20.366
You can see that the second car is his seat cushion.

31
00:02:20.366 --> 00:02:22.233
Really stick to my neighbor's house

32
00:02:22.266 --> 00:02:25.166
I didn't expect President Wan to come to the ninth floor of Tianhai tonight

33
00:02:25.166 --> 00:02:25.933
President Wan

34
00:02:25.933 --> 00:02:28.366
Why didn't he get out of his own car?

35
00:02:28.366 --> 00:02:29.900
Who is President Wan talking to?

36
00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:31.800
How could he make President Wan so feudal?
