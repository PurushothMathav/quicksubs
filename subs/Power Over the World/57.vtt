00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.100
Whether the expert is qualified or not is not up to you

2
00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:05.733
But the president of the Wanbo Chamber of Commerce said it doesn't count.

3
00:00:05.733 --> 00:00:08.066
You, the wife of the Xiao family, have the final say

4
00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:11.133
President Wang, look at this trash

5
00:00:11.133 --> 00:00:12.466
He's here to make trouble.

6
00:00:12.533 --> 00:00:14.100
What we say doesn't count.

7
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:16.400
This is clearly not in the eyes of the Wanbo Chamber of Commerce

8
00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:17.200
As long as the appearance

9
00:00:18.366 --> 00:00:19.700
You're right.

10
00:00:19.733 --> 00:00:21.366
Dare to make trouble here

11
00:00:21.366 --> 00:00:23.433
Should be severely punished good morning

12
00:00:30.066 --> 00:00:32.400
Break his legs and throw them away

13
00:00:49.733 --> 00:00:50.933
So brave

14
00:00:50.933 --> 00:00:52.300
Dare to make trouble here

15
00:00:52.466 --> 00:00:54.633
The president is here, you are dead

16
00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.100
Deceive the king and hurt

17
00:01:10.366 --> 00:01:11.766
disobey orders

18
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.500
It's awesome to court death

19
00:01:15.733 --> 00:01:18.400
Dare to make trouble at the Wanbo Fair

20
00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.366
Do you know who is behind it?

21
00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.900
It's Tianmen, this time you're dead

22
00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.266
No one can save you

23
00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.666
Ye Longyuan, you really think of yourself as a character

24
00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.500
Beating up the vice president on the turf of the Universal Chamber of Commerce

25
00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.000
Come to die

26
00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.000
Their battalion beat up the vice president

27
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.433
You can't live if you grab it.

28
00:01:38.466 --> 00:01:41.633
You can still distance yourself from him now

29
00:01:42.566 --> 00:01:43.400
Lin Qianjiao

30
00:01:43.666 --> 00:01:45.466
Do you think everyone is like you?

31
00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.766
To give up your lover in order to go all out

32
00:01:47.766 --> 00:01:49.366
Since I have determined forever

33
00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.200
No matter the sea of swords and fires, I will never leave him

34
00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.400
Wonderful, trust me

35
00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.300
I will let the whole world rise and fall at your feet

36
00:02:06.666 --> 00:02:07.866
Just this set

37
00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:10.166
You have nothing but bragging.
