00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:01.866
Is what you said true?

2
00:00:04.533 --> 00:00:06.566
It seems that my eyes are right

3
00:00:06.733 --> 00:00:07.900
That's not possible.

4
00:00:07.966 --> 00:00:10.266
I have already investigated this Ye Longyuan

5
00:00:10.266 --> 00:00:12.866
He's just a trash abandoned by his neighbors

6
00:00:12.866 --> 00:00:14.066
Just order

7
00:00:14.466 --> 00:00:16.600
If he is from Tianmen

8
00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.133
Can they kick him out?

9
00:00:18.133 --> 00:00:19.633
Already offered up

10
00:00:19.666 --> 00:00:22.300
Come on, are you mistaken?

11
00:00:22.933 --> 00:00:24.066
Two and a half years ago.

12
00:00:24.066 --> 00:00:25.600
My eyes are on fire

13
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.933
It was the Tianmen people he brought who saved it.

14
00:00:27.933 --> 00:00:28.733
i

15
00:00:29.466 --> 00:00:33.000
Mom and grandpa said it was Lord Long Yuan

16
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.833
Is it obviously the upper echelons of Tianmen?

17
00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.033
Not at the top.

18
00:00:38.166 --> 00:00:39.766
Just a squad leader

19
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:42.933
You squad leader

20
00:00:42.933 --> 00:00:45.400
I thought how powerful this Ye Luoyuan was

21
00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.266
Just a squad leader

22
00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.000
That person is also from Tianmen

23
00:00:49.133 --> 00:00:52.700
Wan Bohao is the dean of one of the 36 courts of Tianmen

24
00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:53.766
Ah a squad leader

25
00:00:53.766 --> 00:00:55.533
Can you basically talk to the dean?

26
00:00:55.533 --> 00:00:57.400
So you have to abdicate

27
00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:58.866
I will take over the position of president

28
00:00:58.866 --> 00:01:01.366
Go and connect with President Wan about this project.

29
00:01:01.566 --> 00:01:03.233
I'll take care of the project.

30
00:01:04.466 --> 00:01:05.766
After this business partnership

31
00:01:05.766 --> 00:01:07.333
What if this is solved?

32
00:01:07.333 --> 00:01:08.166
That's it.

33
00:01:08.166 --> 00:01:09.400
If you don't solve it

34
00:01:09.466 --> 00:01:10.066
quit president

35
00:01:10.066 --> 00:01:13.100
This is good, I agree.

36
00:01:37.766 --> 00:01:39.233
Grandpa you go

37
00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:41.666
Grandpa

38
00:01:41.666 --> 00:01:44.666
Look at Long Hospital, he is just an ordinary Tianmen man

39
00:01:44.666 --> 00:01:47.000
Can you use your connections to help him more?

40
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:47.966
You are in a hurry

41
00:01:47.966 --> 00:01:49.466
Grandpa just got the news

42
00:01:49.466 --> 00:01:51.733
The Lord God of Tianmen has arrived at the smoke field

43
00:01:51.733 --> 00:01:54.200
I live in Villa No. 1 in Kyushu

44
00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.900
You want to ask Yuelongyuan to take you to visit the Lord God

45
00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:59.366
In front of you, really

46
00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.000
The donor has taken care of everything

47
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.366
After the business summit, I removed the Chen family from the list

48
00:02:08.366 --> 00:02:09.266
Please rest assured.

49
00:02:09.266 --> 00:02:11.566
Good, you go first.

50
00:02:11.566 --> 00:02:13.366
I will contact you if anything happens.

51
00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:14.966
subordinate retires

52
00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.066
Hello Longyuan

53
00:02:28.366 --> 00:02:31.300
Can you take me to Kyushu 1 to meet God?

54
00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.233
I'm right in front of Villa No. 1 in Kyushu, really?

55
00:02:36.333 --> 00:02:39.666
Wait, I'll be right over to wait for you.
