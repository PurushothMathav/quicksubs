00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:02.933
Shaojie, don't you know President Wan?

2
00:00:02.933 --> 00:00:03.933
You go to him

3
00:00:03.933 --> 00:00:05.600
Maybe not only will you get an invitation letter

4
00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:07.700
You can also get some projects

5
00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:09.966
Aunt, it seems that President Wan has a distinguished guest tonight

6
00:00:09.966 --> 00:00:11.100
I wasn't doing well in the past

7
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:13.366
Shaojie, just try it

8
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:14.566
Just a simple chat

9
00:00:15.266 --> 00:00:16.233
OK.

10
00:00:19.333 --> 00:00:23.166
Don't get beat up by his bodyguards after drinking this time

11
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:25.533
You have left

12
00:00:25.533 --> 00:00:27.566
If there is any problem with the bicycle tire

13
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:28.766
My name is Chen Shaojie

14
00:00:28.966 --> 00:00:30.266
Lin family starter

15
00:00:30.366 --> 00:00:31.966
Meet Mr. Wan

16
00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.366
We are friends of President Wan

17
00:00:34.366 --> 00:00:36.666
Tonight, President Wan also sent someone to give us a gift.

18
00:00:36.966 --> 00:00:38.033
Leave immediately

19
00:00:39.466 --> 00:00:41.600
I have reserved the Tianzi box for you.

20
00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:55.866
You are visiting the president's distinguished guest

21
00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:59.200
This back is so familiar

22
00:00:59.266 --> 00:01:01.633
It seems to be Ye Longyuan

23
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.800
That's not possible.

24
00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.000
How could that trash be the guest of the foreign president?

25
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.766
It's just that the back is a bit similar

26
00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:13.900
Shao Jie is right

27
00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:15.133
Since you can't see President Wan

28
00:01:15.133 --> 00:01:16.366
Then go see Mr. Xiao

29
00:01:16.366 --> 00:01:18.200
Let him take us to see President Wan

30
00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.866
Is there really such a god-like back in this world?
