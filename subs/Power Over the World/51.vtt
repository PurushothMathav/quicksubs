00:00:00.466 --> 00:00:01.266
Oh, dear.

2
00:00:01.566 --> 00:00:03.966
This is the legendary invitation letter

3
00:00:04.066 --> 00:00:06.000
Who in the world can come up with a supreme invitation letter

4
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.800
Not enough five fingers

5
00:00:08.166 --> 00:00:10.066
Dear sir, please come in

6
00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:17.000
How could he have a supreme invitation?

7
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.866
That's something we don't have

8
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.100
I have long heard that Tianmen pursues the relationship with the Tang family

9
00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:22.366
This must have been done by the Tang family

10
00:00:22.366 --> 00:00:24.866
Today I must be in front of President Wan

11
00:00:24.866 --> 00:00:26.566
Pierce Ye Longyuan's face

12
00:00:26.566 --> 00:00:27.900
Let Tang Miaoyin take a look

13
00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.666
What kind of person is he?

14
00:00:29.733 --> 00:00:31.100
Let's go.

15
00:00:47.566 --> 00:00:48.800
Longyuan

16
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.000
You see, so many people are all business giants

17
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.466
commercial giant

18
00:00:54.466 --> 00:00:56.466
No, nothing.

19
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.266
Trash can ride a horse worth 500 here tonight

20
00:01:04.266 --> 00:01:06.066
You don't have 500 yuan in your body

21
00:01:06.066 --> 00:01:07.066
Are you qualified?

22
00:01:07.066 --> 00:01:07.966
Didn't you say

23
00:01:07.966 --> 00:01:10.333
Aren't we qualified for a business summit?

24
00:01:10.333 --> 00:01:12.366
Now I'm still in

25
00:01:12.366 --> 00:01:15.400
Even your qualifications to come here are given to you by me

26
00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.833
Otherwise, you can come here

27
00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.466
Haha, you are a waste who only eats soft rice.

28
00:01:21.466 --> 00:01:23.200
Also said that the qualifications you gave

29
00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.300
I will teach you a good lesson today

30
00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.266
Old thing, my man, you dare to hit him too

31
00:01:29.266 --> 00:01:30.333
If there is a next time

32
00:01:30.333 --> 00:01:32.433
I let your neighbor hang white sails

33
00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.833
Peng Miaoyin, don't go too far

34
00:01:35.133 --> 00:01:36.566
I'll go even further.

35
00:01:36.766 --> 00:01:37.866
Would you like to try it?

36
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.333
Ye Longyuan, we can come in with voice help

37
00:01:41.333 --> 00:01:42.833
What does it have to do with you?

38
00:01:42.866 --> 00:01:44.133
Why didn't I notice it before?

39
00:01:44.133 --> 00:01:45.666
You are such a shameless person.

40
00:01:45.666 --> 00:01:46.866
Divorce you

41
00:01:46.866 --> 00:01:49.766
It was the best choice I ever made in my life
