1
00:00:00.933 --> 00:00:01.800
Exactly.

2
00:00:02.366 --> 00:00:04.966
This is the genuine Tianmen Kunlun Seal

3
00:00:07.266 --> 00:00:09.600
Master, you said this is the Kunlun seal.

4
00:00:11.166 --> 00:00:13.100
But how can this hard word support the jade pendant?

5
00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:14.100
fool

6
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:15.566
Tianmen is sleepy

7
00:00:15.566 --> 00:00:17.866
It should be made from Korean Yuyu over 2,000 years old

8
00:00:17.866 --> 00:00:19.700
This is the only place in the world

9
00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:22.900
What? This is the genuine Kunlun Seal?

10
00:00:22.966 --> 00:00:24.500
What Ye Longyuan said is true

11
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:25.666
This is really the Kunlun seal.

12
00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:27.733
How silly of the people next door!

13
00:00:27.733 --> 00:00:29.200
It's going to be a long history of printing

14
00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:30.633
I don't know the Kunlun Seal

15
00:00:31.266 --> 00:00:32.300
I see.

16
00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:33.500
It's all this bastard

17
00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.766
It was he who broke the wrath of the Lord God provoked by Yin Evil

18
00:00:36.766 --> 00:00:39.166
That's why the Dragon Gate Banquet was cancelled.

19
00:00:40.366 --> 00:00:42.233
I'm really upset about going anywhere

20
00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.833
Tianmen Kunlun Ye, you dare to damage it

21
00:00:45.333 --> 00:00:47.633
I'm damaged, so what?

22
00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:49.600
You're still as crazy as ever

23
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.666
Damaged Tianmen Kunlun for one year

24
00:00:51.933 --> 00:00:53.733
How many heads do you have?

25
00:00:53.733 --> 00:00:55.533
Master, take a look at him

26
00:00:55.533 --> 00:00:57.000
Tianmen Wanguo Chamber of Commerce

27
00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.033
Any one of them could have killed him.

28
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.400
He doesn't care about anyone

29
00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:02.700
You haven't changed a bit in all these years

30
00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:04.100
I've been crazy since I was a kid

31
00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.300
What does changing your style have to do with you?

32
00:01:07.366 --> 00:01:08.900
What are you doing here?

33
00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.800
Ben and Yan Chen have two things to do

34
00:01:14.366 --> 00:01:16.933
This one participates in the World Chamber of Commerce the day after tomorrow

35
00:01:16.933 --> 00:01:18.766
Global business associations held

36
00:01:18.766 --> 00:01:22.200
Second, I heard my fiancee is here

37
00:01:22.666 --> 00:01:24.500
Ben came to find him

38
00:01:25.133 --> 00:01:25.900
big or small

39
00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.566
Who is lucky enough to be your fiancee?

40
00:01:28.966 --> 00:01:29.866
Ah!

41
00:01:32.133 --> 00:01:35.866
