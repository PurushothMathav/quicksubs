00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:01.500
How are you

2
00:00:03.133 --> 00:00:04.766
Why can't it be me?

3
00:00:04.766 --> 00:00:06.766
The person you want to meet is not me

4
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.900
Damn, we want to see President Wan

5
00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:09.866
What about President Wan?

6
00:00:09.866 --> 00:00:11.166
Isn't he receiving VIPs?

7
00:00:11.166 --> 00:00:14.066
President Wan's whereabouts still need to be reported to you

8
00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:15.366
What about VIPs?

9
00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:16.600
I am the VIP

10
00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:17.666
Wait for him here

11
00:00:19.366 --> 00:00:21.933
Gao Linjun, you are a young master of the Xiao family

12
00:00:21.933 --> 00:00:24.400
Are you worthy to be President Wan's VIP guest?

13
00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:26.666
We just saw it outside.

14
00:00:26.666 --> 00:00:28.700
President Wan has great respect for VIPs

15
00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:30.866
As President Wan, it is still so

16
00:00:30.866 --> 00:00:32.800
The identity of the VIP can be imagined

17
00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.833
Look at yourself, look in the mirror, do you match?

18
00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:39.033
Wan Guohao has to kneel down and talk when he sees me

19
00:00:39.466 --> 00:00:41.133
Do you think I'm tall enough?

20
00:00:41.133 --> 00:00:44.600
What kind of status is President Wan still kneeling down with you?

21
00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.233
I think you sneaked in.

22
00:00:48.966 --> 00:00:50.000
Can't you see?

23
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.333
Someone is sneaking in here

24
00:00:51.333 --> 00:00:52.666
Kick him out

25
00:00:52.966 --> 00:00:55.233
Lao Tie, we have no right to take care of customers

26
00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.733
Do you think you are eligible to be reimbursed by this Tianzi number?

27
00:01:02.733 --> 00:01:04.566
Is this where you can come?

28
00:01:04.566 --> 00:01:07.133
You still don't trust me as always

29
00:01:07.133 --> 00:01:08.166
Then since you don't trust me

30
00:01:08.166 --> 00:01:10.166
Why are you still talking nonsense?

31
00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.166
Your identity

32
00:01:12.166 --> 00:01:13.200
Your status

33
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.700
What you do

34
00:01:14.866 --> 00:01:16.966
Is there anything I can believe in?

35
00:01:17.533 --> 00:01:19.933
status

36
00:01:19.933 --> 00:01:21.400
Just because of these

37
00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:22.500
So in your eyes

38
00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.333
I am the one who will never be trusted

39
00:01:25.333 --> 00:01:27.666
One-sentence person, right?

40
00:01:32.066 --> 00:01:34.966
I want you to stop talking nonsense here tomorrow

41
00:01:34.966 --> 00:01:37.433
Do you think we will believe what you say?

42
00:01:37.466 --> 00:01:39.133
Or get out by yourself

43
00:01:39.133 --> 00:01:41.266
Or I'll get someone to throw you out

44
00:01:45.966 --> 00:01:47.500
Who is arguing here?
