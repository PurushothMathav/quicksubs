1
00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:02.300
Peng Miaoyin, think carefully.

2
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:04.900
I don't believe in faces

3
00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:06.000
Will kill one in the attack

4
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.166
Likewise, Mr. Tang

5
00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:10.300
You give up on Master Xiao and choose a waste

6
00:00:10.366 --> 00:00:12.233
You will regret it.

7
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:14.966
I hope you don't regret it.

8
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.333
Sun Longyuan divorced

9
00:00:16.333 --> 00:00:18.066
It's the biggest mistake you've ever made in your life

10
00:00:18.066 --> 00:00:18.966
Wang Miaoyin

11
00:00:19.266 --> 00:00:22.333
I really would rather marry that old trash

12
00:00:22.333 --> 00:00:23.700
Don't marry this young master

13
00:00:23.733 --> 00:00:26.366
Xiao Lingqing, if you want to die

14
00:00:26.466 --> 00:00:27.500
You continue

15
00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:29.600
I'd love to let you taste my tricks

16
00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:32.933
Okay, you're a piece of trash. Talk to me about means, right?

17
00:00:32.933 --> 00:00:34.666
Ok, I'll fulfill you.

18
00:00:34.666 --> 00:00:36.133
Don't Tang Miaoyin like you?

19
00:00:36.133 --> 00:00:37.166
Do you want to marry you?

20
00:00:37.166 --> 00:00:38.266
Then I will kill you.

21
00:00:38.266 --> 00:00:40.533
I see who he will marry Xiao Liu, please dare

22
00:00:40.533 --> 00:00:42.066
My Tang family is not easy to mess with either.

23
00:00:42.866 --> 00:00:44.166
If you don't believe me, you can try it.

24
00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:45.666
Ok ok ok ok

25
00:00:45.933 --> 00:00:47.800
Are you going against me for him?

26
00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.433
Then I will make you kneel in front of me and regret it.

27
00:00:50.566 --> 00:00:53.400
Ok I see what you can do

28
00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.733
I heard that at the Global Business Summit

29
00:00:56.733 --> 00:00:59.433
Your Galactic Group wants to have a deal with the Universal Chamber of Commerce

30
00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.000
Billion dollar project

31
00:01:01.333 --> 00:01:02.166
What do you mean?

32
00:01:02.166 --> 00:01:05.466
I don't know if this project falls into the hands of my Xiao family

33
00:01:05.466 --> 00:01:06.700
What will happen to you?

34
00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:09.466
I'll give you one more chance.

35
00:01:09.466 --> 00:01:10.466
Either you marry me

36
00:01:10.466 --> 00:01:12.166
Or marry that loser

37
00:01:12.166 --> 00:01:13.900
Smile tomorrow.

38
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.966
With me here, you don't want to be taken away by the child.

39
00:01:18.966 --> 00:01:20.866
Xiao, are you going to say it again?

40
00:01:20.866 --> 00:01:23.500
The president of the World Chamber of Commerce is also holding your hand.

41
00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.266
You don't even know

42
00:01:25.266 --> 00:01:28.066
He just said that President Wan would also listen to him

43
00:01:28.066 --> 00:01:31.766
Yes, I said that if he goes east, Wan Guohao will not dare to go there.
