00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:04.100
Hey, this is the chairperson of Guohao Group

2
00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:06.900
Wan Guohao, the president of the World Chamber of Commerce?

3
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:08.566
This young man is doomed.

4
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.000
President Wan is the head of state

5
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.866
Be careful with his big ears

6
00:00:13.066 --> 00:00:16.200
He can bring down the entire regional economy with one word

7
00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:17.633
President Wan

8
00:00:19.466 --> 00:00:21.100
They are all Xie Longyan, this kid mountain Taoist priest

9
00:00:21.133 --> 00:00:23.833
He also tore up the IWC contract to the Xiao family

10
00:00:23.866 --> 00:00:24.966
And not only that.

11
00:00:24.966 --> 00:00:26.833
He also assaulted a business summit security guard

12
00:00:26.866 --> 00:00:29.200
Lawless people should be severely punished

13
00:00:31.366 --> 00:00:32.400
Vice President Wang

14
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.833
You tell me what the hell is going on

15
00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:37.100
What Ms. Zheng and Chen Shao said is absolutely true

16
00:00:37.366 --> 00:00:38.666
He not only broke the contract

17
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.666
But they beat me and the security guard

18
00:00:41.066 --> 00:00:43.700
He even said that you have to stay together when you see him

19
00:00:44.166 --> 00:00:46.166
President Wan, did you hear that?

20
00:00:46.166 --> 00:00:48.166
This kind of waste must be severely punished

21
00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.866
Otherwise, what's the face of the Universal Chamber of Commerce?

22
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.833
Wan Hui Chang is angry

23
00:00:56.866 --> 00:00:59.000
Ye Longyuan is dead this time

24
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.666
Miss Lin, is everything they said true?

25
00:01:02.666 --> 00:01:04.466
Handsome, say it

26
00:01:04.466 --> 00:01:05.566
It's all done by this trash

27
00:01:05.566 --> 00:01:06.966
It has nothing to do with our neighbor

28
00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.233
Yeah, forefoot, don't hesitate

29
00:01:12.733 --> 00:01:15.966
President Pan, can I not answer this question?

30
00:01:15.966 --> 00:01:18.566
Is it hard for you to tell the truth?
