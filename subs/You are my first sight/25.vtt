00:00:00.933 --> 00:00:02.266
Calm down march

2
00:00:02.466 --> 00:00:04.233
Let me explain.

3
00:00:04.366 --> 00:00:05.466
What's there to explain?

4
00:00:05.666 --> 00:00:08.866
You know he's mad at you, I know

5
00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:09.966
So what?

6
00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:12.500
What about you? Do you have any problems at all?

7
00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.866
It's my fault, I shouldn't care about him

8
00:00:14.866 --> 00:00:16.466
Just let him sleep on the street

9
00:00:17.266 --> 00:00:18.366
It's not that I didn't tell you.

10
00:00:18.366 --> 00:00:20.266
I helped him out of good intentions

11
00:00:20.266 --> 00:00:21.500
He wouldn't let me tell you.

12
00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:22.966
If only he knew I told you

13
00:00:22.966 --> 00:00:24.366
What to do if you are excited

14
00:00:24.533 --> 00:00:26.666
He's been through too much stimulation lately

15
00:00:26.666 --> 00:00:29.200
I thought I wouldn't tell you until he calmed down

16
00:00:29.866 --> 00:00:30.700
Never mind.

17
00:00:30.966 --> 00:00:32.933
If you think I'm doing something wrong

18
00:00:32.933 --> 00:00:34.566
You can blame me and scold me

19
00:00:34.566 --> 00:00:36.100
You're my only brother

20
00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.100
Whatever. What about me?

21
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.133
Don't I feel the same way?

22
00:00:39.133 --> 00:00:41.166
Don't I have only one brother like you?

23
00:00:41.466 --> 00:00:42.700
I just feel like

24
00:00:43.166 --> 00:00:45.466
You've kept me alive for so long

25
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:46.900
I didn't think it through

26
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.166
Not next time.

27
00:00:49.666 --> 00:00:52.966
Hey, you don't like anyone, do you?

28
00:00:53.866 --> 00:00:55.900
Yes I like him

29
00:00:58.066 --> 00:00:59.266
Hahaha

30
00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.966
How is that possible? You are my only brother.

31
00:01:01.966 --> 00:01:03.100
He is the woman you like

32
00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:04.766
How could I like him?

33
00:01:04.933 --> 00:01:06.466
Haha, don't kid me.

34
00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.700
Why is Master Song jealous?

35
00:01:09.566 --> 00:01:10.366
How can there be

36
00:01:13.266 --> 00:01:14.966
He's been reluctant to talk to me lately

37
00:01:15.266 --> 00:01:16.400
Don't be with him all the time

38
00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:17.833
Didn't he send it out?

39
00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.300
I won't let him abort the baby
