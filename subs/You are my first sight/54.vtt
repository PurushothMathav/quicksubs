00:00:00.466 --> 00:00:02.766
Have you asked anyone out for the holidays?

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:04.966
That's no

3
00:00:04.966 --> 00:00:06.466
I don't usually have any friends.

4
00:00:06.466 --> 00:00:09.066
It's just a pity, you think carefully.

5
00:00:09.366 --> 00:00:10.466
Really not.

6
00:00:10.466 --> 00:00:13.400
What's the matter, I've found some clues here.

7
00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.833
Someone did get me drunk that night

8
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.300
I just don't know if I'm aiming for you or me

9
00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:19.133
who

10
00:00:19.133 --> 00:00:21.166
The waiter said he had only met the man

11
00:00:21.166 --> 00:00:23.200
I don't know what his name is

12
00:00:23.566 --> 00:00:26.100
There were so many people that night, who the hell knows who it was?

13
00:00:26.133 --> 00:00:27.600
Then you adjust the monitoring?

14
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.000
There is no surveillance in that place.

15
00:00:29.766 --> 00:00:31.500
Mostly for you

16
00:00:32.333 --> 00:00:35.600
Then don't I become cannon fodder?

17
00:00:36.266 --> 00:00:37.000
Anyway

18
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.500
Don't tell anyone about these things yet

19
00:00:41.133 --> 00:00:42.433
Hello Xiaoning

20
00:00:42.466 --> 00:00:43.700
5 million I paid it off

21
00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:45.700
Don't worry about it.

22
00:00:45.733 --> 00:00:47.000
This 5 million

23
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.633
Where did you get so much money?

24
00:00:49.166 --> 00:00:51.800
My brokerage company paid me in advance

25
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.766
It's okay, your economic company is so kind to you.

26
00:00:54.766 --> 00:00:57.466
5 million said one is one

27
00:00:57.466 --> 00:00:59.766
There's no conspiracy.
