00:00:05.333 --> 00:00:07.100
Mr. Song found it

2
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:11.300
Go ahead.

3
00:00:12.166 --> 00:00:13.400
What about a celebration party?

4
00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.466
What kind of celebration party is that?

5
00:00:15.466 --> 00:00:18.000
You also put on me who knows you.

6
00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:19.466
What? Who knows me?

7
00:00:19.466 --> 00:00:20.366
I don't know.

8
00:00:20.366 --> 00:00:22.533
You have a 70-year-old grandmother, right?

9
00:00:22.533 --> 00:00:24.100
He is delivering wine and tea to us.

10
00:00:24.666 --> 00:00:26.666
You said it was tea

11
00:00:26.666 --> 00:00:28.666
Not to mention drinking medicine

12
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.900
Okay, I said I said the night of the celebration party

13
00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:36.500
Someone to support me

14
00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.700
Let me call the guy over there

15
00:00:38.766 --> 00:00:40.033
Send a bowl of sober soup

16
00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:41.833
And give me 50,000 bucks

17
00:00:41.866 --> 00:00:42.766
What does it look like?

18
00:00:42.766 --> 00:00:44.866
The man is very thin and tall.

19
00:00:44.866 --> 00:00:45.900
What's your name?

20
00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:47.266
I don't know.

21
00:00:48.966 --> 00:00:49.800
Mr. Song

22
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:52.600
OK

23
00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.766
Did you ask anyone out for the holidays? What's the matter?

24
00:00:56.066 --> 00:00:57.633
I found some clues here.

25
00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.066
Someone did get me drunk that night

26
00:01:00.066 --> 00:01:01.533
Just don't know if they're after you

27
00:01:01.533 --> 00:01:02.600
Or at me?
