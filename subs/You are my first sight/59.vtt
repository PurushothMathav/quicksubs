00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:04.033
Master Xu Jingchuan, what do you plan to do?

2
00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:06.200
I'm going to find him.

3
00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:08.000
Master, I don't think this is appropriate

4
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.866
We still haven't figured out his motives

5
00:00:09.866 --> 00:00:12.266
It would be too abrupt to go directly to him like this

6
00:00:12.333 --> 00:00:14.800
I guess there was a problem with the listed company before.

7
00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:16.266
It must be his fault too.

8
00:00:16.533 --> 00:00:17.833
Please give me some time.

9
00:00:17.933 --> 00:00:19.566
We'll find out.

10
00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.566
Okay, go to the waiter's house first

11
00:00:29.966 --> 00:00:31.700
The young master ran away

12
00:00:31.966 --> 00:00:33.800
Do you remember that waiter?

13
00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.000
Yeah. Why?

14
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.533
Did you tell Seo Jingchuan?

15
00:00:36.533 --> 00:00:37.733
I don't have it.

16
00:00:37.733 --> 00:00:39.466
Then why does he know it's not?

17
00:00:39.466 --> 00:00:41.333
What does this have to do with Xu Jingchuan?

18
00:00:41.333 --> 00:00:44.500
You still pretend to be the future Song Zeyue

19
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:45.800
What's wrong with you?

20
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.500
I haven't seen him in a while

21
00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.066
If I lie to you

22
00:00:49.066 --> 00:00:51.100
My brother will not recover

23
00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.066
What the hell is going on?

24
00:00:55.066 --> 00:00:56.433
Say it now

25
00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.433
Surveillance found out

26
00:00:58.533 --> 00:00:59.633
It's Xu Jingchuan

27
00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.400
Xu Jingchuan isn't that why?

28
00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.233
Aren't you two good brothers?
