00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:02.400
Zeyu, listen to me explain

2
00:00:03.533 --> 00:00:04.600
Explain what?

3
00:00:04.666 --> 00:00:07.000
Is to explain that you kept his whereabouts from me

4
00:00:07.166 --> 00:00:09.733
Or explain that you were secretly with him behind my back?

5
00:00:09.733 --> 00:00:11.566
Zeyu is not what you think

6
00:00:11.566 --> 00:00:13.100
The hotel was indeed opened by me for Xiaoning

7
00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.900
Xiaoning

8
00:00:14.066 --> 00:00:16.933
It's really affectionate, don't blame Xu Jingchuan

9
00:00:16.933 --> 00:00:18.966
I told him not to tell you

10
00:00:18.966 --> 00:00:19.966
Why is that?

11
00:00:20.266 --> 00:00:23.500
Because I don't want to see you again, you avoid me

12
00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:25.033
He's not answering my phone.

13
00:00:25.166 --> 00:00:27.100
Do you have any idea how worried I was about you?

14
00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:28.200
worry

15
00:00:28.766 --> 00:00:31.266
I can't bear your worry.

16
00:00:31.866 --> 00:00:33.166
What do you mean?

17
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.200
Isn't it obvious what I mean?

18
00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.800
I just want you to go

19
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:39.866
Shen Minnie you

20
00:00:40.333 --> 00:00:41.633
What are you saying?

21
00:00:41.733 --> 00:00:43.066
Don't you think so?

22
00:00:43.066 --> 00:00:45.966
You push me step by step into the abyss

23
00:00:45.966 --> 00:00:47.666
I'm surprised you think so

24
00:00:47.666 --> 00:00:49.300
Are you still not reconciled?

25
00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:50.700
I'll tell you what.

26
00:00:50.866 --> 00:00:52.233
The person I like

27
00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:54.233
It's Xu Jingchuan

28
00:00:57.533 --> 00:00:59.733
He is very attentive to my emotions

29
00:00:59.733 --> 00:01:01.866
When I needed help the most

30
00:01:01.866 --> 00:01:03.700
He will always be by my side

31
00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:05.333
Without him

32
00:01:05.333 --> 00:01:07.833
I could be burned to death one day

33
00:01:08.533 --> 00:01:09.500
Shen Yuning

34
00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.100
Wasting me in front of my parents

35
00:01:13.333 --> 00:01:15.366
Desperately trying to save your child

36
00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.000
You just chilled my heart

37
00:01:19.333 --> 00:01:20.966
Then why haven't you left yet?

38
00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:27.400
March
