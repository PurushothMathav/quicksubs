00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:03.300
Get up get up

2
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:04.300
Give me out

3
00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:06.833
He Yu, why are you here?

4
00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:09.866
Don't you know why I'm here?

5
00:00:10.733 --> 00:00:13.100
I don't know what you're talking about. I don't understand.

6
00:00:14.733 --> 00:00:17.500
Xingchen Gong is always Shen Yuning

7
00:00:18.133 --> 00:00:19.466
You know it all

8
00:00:20.366 --> 00:00:22.866
You hurt me, it hurts

9
00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:24.700
You have two lives

10
00:00:24.933 --> 00:00:26.633
Are you crazy?

11
00:00:26.866 --> 00:00:28.266
So what?

12
00:00:28.266 --> 00:00:30.266
I'm your real fiancee

13
00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.066
What is that woman?

14
00:00:32.066 --> 00:00:33.500
Are you crazy or am I crazy?

15
00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:34.466
I'll tell you what.

16
00:00:35.133 --> 00:00:37.600
I will accept your engagement with me

17
00:00:37.866 --> 00:00:39.900
If you dare to touch the salted fish mud again

18
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:41.200
I'm not done with you

19
00:00:43.733 --> 00:00:44.600
Zeyu

20
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:48.800
Yes

21
00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:50.866
What did you say

22
00:00:50.866 --> 00:00:51.900
You have a fiancee?

23
00:00:52.733 --> 00:00:54.966
Well this time you sleep

24
00:00:55.566 --> 00:00:56.600
He did it.

25
00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:57.733
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

26
00:00:57.733 --> 00:01:00.000
I don't like him just speeding falcons

27
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.366
I'll find a way to get out of the breach

28
00:01:01.366 --> 00:01:02.333
It's just your idea.

29
00:01:02.333 --> 00:01:03.366
He won't agree

30
00:01:03.366 --> 00:01:05.600
If this goes on, won't I become a third party?

31
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:06.466
I'm leaving here.

32
00:01:06.466 --> 00:01:07.166
I want to go home.

33
00:01:07.166 --> 00:01:08.166
You calm down

34
00:01:08.166 --> 00:01:09.400
How do you want me to calm down?

35
00:01:09.466 --> 00:01:11.200
He's going to kill my child

36
00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.233
This is the next time my life will be gone

37
00:01:15.133 --> 00:01:15.666
Really not

38
00:01:15.666 --> 00:01:17.166
I promise how to guarantee

39
00:01:17.166 --> 00:01:19.500
Can you promise to keep an eye on me 24 hours a day?

40
00:01:19.533 --> 00:01:20.800
I'm getting out of here.
