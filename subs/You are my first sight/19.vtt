1
00:00:00.466 --> 00:00:02.200
I never want to see him again.

2
00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:04.300
Since I went to the wrong room that night

3
00:00:04.866 --> 00:00:06.466
It seems that since I met him

4
00:00:06.466 --> 00:00:08.966
My life started to get more and more out of control

5
00:00:08.966 --> 00:00:10.100
Increasing preference

6
00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:12.300
It has endangered my health

7
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.166
Including my reputation has also been affected

8
00:00:14.166 --> 00:00:15.766
But what did I get?

9
00:00:15.766 --> 00:00:17.833
Is that what he calls financial aid?

10
00:00:18.133 --> 00:00:19.066
If so

11
00:00:19.066 --> 00:00:20.633
Then I'd rather cut ties

12
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:22.800
As if nothing had happened

13
00:00:22.933 --> 00:00:25.666
I can also make money for my brother's illness.

14
00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.700
You're still too innocent

15
00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:30.133
Although I am friends with him

16
00:00:30.133 --> 00:00:31.466
But I still have to remind you

17
00:00:31.466 --> 00:00:33.700
Behind the Song family is not so simple

18
00:00:33.866 --> 00:00:36.300
What would happen to you if his parents found out?

19
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.666
If you give birth to children

20
00:00:37.666 --> 00:00:38.766
What will happen to the child

21
00:00:38.933 --> 00:00:40.200
Although we are not familiar with

22
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.800
But I already know about you and Zeyu

23
00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:42.933
It's almost the same.

24
00:00:42.933 --> 00:00:44.200
I also see your pity.

25
00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:45.466
I just saved you today.

26
00:00:45.533 --> 00:00:47.500
Let go of brotherhood and talk to you about this

27
00:00:47.566 --> 00:00:49.266
If you think I'm wrong

28
00:00:49.266 --> 00:00:51.400
You can pretend I didn't say no.

29
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:52.500
You're right actually.

30
00:00:52.733 --> 00:00:54.766
I didn't think it through myself.

31
00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.500
I have never met such a person.

32
00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.300
I don't know why things went the way they did.

33
00:00:58.300 --> 00:00:59.233
This is it now.

34
00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.866
Now I just want to be alone

35
00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:04.866
Here's my card.

36
00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:06.300
Feel free to contact me if you have anything.

37
00:01:09.133 --> 00:01:11.433
By the way, if you don't mind

38
00:01:11.466 --> 00:01:12.633
I can be your friend
