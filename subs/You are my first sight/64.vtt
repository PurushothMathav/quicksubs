00:00:10.366 --> 00:00:13.266
What's the matter? I was asking you something

2
00:00:13.466 --> 00:00:14.266
What!

3
00:00:14.333 --> 00:00:16.766
Song Zeyu's company finances are in trouble

4
00:00:16.766 --> 00:00:18.300
Did you know about this?

5
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:21.400
Do you know?

6
00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.000
Xiaoning told me that it seems to be quite serious.

7
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
If you don't get it right, the company can't go public

8
00:00:26.333 --> 00:00:27.500
Is that right?

9
00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:29.466
You look me in the eye and tell me

10
00:00:29.766 --> 00:00:31.666
It's true, you said it all

11
00:00:31.666 --> 00:00:33.400
We are now grasshoppers on a string

12
00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:34.600
I can still lie to you

13
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.033
I guess you wouldn't dare to lie to me either.

14
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:38.533
Then just wait.

15
00:00:38.533 --> 00:00:39.800
See how I treat him

16
00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.300
The company goes public in the next life

17
00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:49.000
Hey, what's up?

18
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.800
Don't you want to make up for it?

19
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.833
Here's your chance. What do you do?

20
00:00:55.366 --> 00:00:56.400
Listen to this.

21
00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:57.766
Recently

22
00:00:57.766 --> 00:00:59.633
Thank you all for your hard work

23
00:00:59.933 --> 00:01:01.966
Our company is about to go public

24
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.900
Thank you all for your hard work.

25
00:01:05.133 --> 00:01:06.733
There are still three days left.

26
00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:08.433
I hope you all hold on tight.

27
00:01:08.866 --> 00:01:10.466
Wait until our company is listed

28
00:01:10.533 --> 00:01:12.200
I'll give everyone a bonus

29
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.200
Dividing shares will never treat you badly.
