00:00:01.266 --> 00:00:02.066
What's up?

2
00:00:02.733 --> 00:00:04.366
Who is missing with your child?

3
00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:06.100
How come?

4
00:00:06.266 --> 00:00:08.000
The doctor said he was in a long-term mood

5
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.066
Qi and blood loss

6
00:00:09.566 --> 00:00:10.866
The body can't take it

7
00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:12.433
So I can't keep you

8
00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:16.966
I really don't understand what he wants

9
00:00:16.966 --> 00:00:19.700
I arranged everything for him

10
00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:20.833
his younger brother

11
00:00:21.066 --> 00:00:23.333
I took care of his brother's affairs for him

12
00:00:23.333 --> 00:00:25.133
Why would he do that?

13
00:00:25.133 --> 00:00:27.000
Do you know why he feels foreseeable?

14
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.066
You just keep transmitting your thoughts

15
00:00:29.066 --> 00:00:30.666
Didn't take into account his feelings at all

16
00:00:31.133 --> 00:00:32.066
I don't know.

17
00:00:33.533 --> 00:00:34.333
You like him?

18
00:00:36.333 --> 00:00:38.800
I don't like it, I don't like it, why do you think so much?

19
00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.133
I'm just worried about my kids.

20
00:00:43.133 --> 00:00:44.566
You weren't like this before

21
00:00:44.566 --> 00:00:46.266
Now a child is holding you back

22
00:00:46.266 --> 00:00:48.633
Since the child is gone, I have cut off contact with him

23
00:00:48.766 --> 00:00:51.266
If you like him, you should set him free

24
00:00:51.333 --> 00:00:52.866
If it's in your hands

25
00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:53.833
It would be worse

26
00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:55.433
Think about your company.

27
00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:57.000
Disconnected from him

28
00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.300
Only good for you

29
00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.900
Everyone has an explanation for their families

30
00:01:02.366 --> 00:01:03.800
For a woman

31
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:05.566
Give up all this

32
00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:07.966
Not worth it.
