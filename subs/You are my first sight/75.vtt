00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.666
I can only let him be a scapegoat

2
00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.166
scapegoat

3
00:00:04.533 --> 00:00:07.133
So Uncle Wang took the blame for you like this

4
00:00:07.133 --> 00:00:08.066
He was in jail.

5
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.200
It's all my fault, don't blame your dad

6
00:00:19.533 --> 00:00:20.966
It's all my fault

7
00:00:20.966 --> 00:00:24.466
I gave your dad the idea

8
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:28.700
So far

9
00:00:28.933 --> 00:00:30.433
I told you so.

10
00:00:31.966 --> 00:00:33.466
That's it.

11
00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.133
You can't say it, I'll come

12
00:00:35.133 --> 00:00:36.700
But what?

13
00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:38.866
But you have to think about our children.

14
00:00:38.866 --> 00:00:40.000
No, I'll do it.

15
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.900
Lao Wang, stop, stop

16
00:00:49.966 --> 00:00:51.366
I bought you an insurance policy

17
00:00:51.566 --> 00:00:52.966
Please sign here

18
00:00:52.966 --> 00:00:55.966
Ah, yes, yes. Thank you, ma'am.

19
00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:57.900
Hey ma'am

20
00:00:58.066 --> 00:01:00.200
You and Mr. Song are really kind to me

21
00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:03.033
Wherever you work so hard, you deserve it.
