00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.700
I want to go home

2
00:00:02.733 --> 00:00:05.166
I mean, there are conditions, okay?

3
00:00:05.166 --> 00:00:06.400
You are my child

4
00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:08.400
Oh, is that Miss Shen?

5
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.666
Oh, young master, you are here, hahaha.

6
00:00:11.666 --> 00:00:13.300
Pregnant women should not blow

7
00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:14.333
Come with me!

8
00:00:14.333 --> 00:00:16.600
This is the housekeeper I hired for you

9
00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:17.700
It's very capable

10
00:00:17.733 --> 00:00:19.600
An aunt will take care of you in the future

11
00:00:19.866 --> 00:00:21.600
Come in, come on

12
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:22.633
Come on. I'm in.

13
00:00:27.333 --> 00:00:28.866
This is what the doctor ordered.

14
00:00:28.866 --> 00:00:30.066
You have to take a good look

15
00:00:31.333 --> 00:00:32.566
This is our courtyard

16
00:00:33.566 --> 00:00:34.633
I'll tell you first, okay?

17
00:00:34.666 --> 00:00:36.066
I will not marry you

18
00:00:36.166 --> 00:00:37.800
But after the baby is born

19
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.033
Custody must be mine

20
00:00:39.933 --> 00:00:42.100
Children can enjoy the best life by following me

21
00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:43.166
The best education?

22
00:00:43.166 --> 00:00:45.666
But if you want to see the kids

23
00:00:45.766 --> 00:00:46.800
Anytime.

24
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.700
In addition, I will give you a sum of money.

25
00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:50.400
Let you live the rest of your life without worry

26
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.066
And I will take care of your brother's medical expenses.

27
00:00:53.333 --> 00:00:55.000
This is not allowed to refuse

28
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.233
You got paid?

29
00:00:57.133 --> 00:00:58.500
I'm so at ease

30
00:01:03.566 --> 00:01:06.000
Mr. Song, the person who changed the company's data found it

31
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.666
Getting up late made him run abroad

32
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:08.766
Did you call the police?

33
00:01:08.766 --> 00:01:10.166
Due to time to take measures

34
00:01:12.866 --> 00:01:14.233
What's the matter, just say something

35
00:01:14.366 --> 00:01:15.933
What happened to Miss Shen in the hotel last time

36
00:01:15.933 --> 00:01:17.133
Said that the data was wrong this time.

37
00:01:17.133 --> 00:01:18.766
I think someone is playing tricks behind it

38
00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:20.833
I think so.

39
00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:22.433
Don't make a sound

40
00:01:22.933 --> 00:01:23.800
The young master is back

41
00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.166
Well, how about you, salted fish?

42
00:01:26.166 --> 00:01:29.233
He's eating, making soup for you, making soup for me
