00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:02.700
Xiao Ke, what's wrong with you?

2
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.366
Ah, it's the deadline for repayment.

3
00:00:06.366 --> 00:00:07.566
How much is missing?

4
00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:13.800
5.005 billion 5 million?

5
00:00:14.333 --> 00:00:14.933
What to do then?

6
00:00:14.933 --> 00:00:16.700
I only have ten thousand dollars

7
00:00:16.966 --> 00:00:18.000
Ten thousand, take it

8
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.866
Let's pay for my brother's medical expenses

9
00:00:19.866 --> 00:00:21.200
Oops, it doesn't matter.

10
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:22.833
I'm doing so many tasks now

11
00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:24.566
I'll give it to you first if you want.

12
00:00:25.766 --> 00:00:27.300
It's all karma

13
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.566
But if you don't listen

14
00:00:28.566 --> 00:00:31.166
Those sweet words the boss said?

15
00:00:31.166 --> 00:00:33.033
I don't covet his money.

16
00:00:33.533 --> 00:00:37.400
No, it's cloudy, okay, it's over.

17
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:38.366
Come, come, it's alright

18
00:00:38.366 --> 00:00:40.866
It's all over, don't be so late.

19
00:00:40.866 --> 00:00:41.966
It's all over

20
00:00:41.966 --> 00:00:44.133
In this case, wait for me and I'll go back and get my bag.

21
00:00:44.133 --> 00:00:45.433
Wait for me let's go home

22
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.466
Ah I want

23
00:00:53.266 --> 00:00:54.266
Try it

24
00:00:55.666 --> 00:00:57.500
Smells good

25
00:00:57.933 --> 00:00:59.100
Eat this bowl of noodles

26
00:00:59.133 --> 00:01:00.866
So-called everything will be solved

27
00:01:00.866 --> 00:01:03.266
God bless, God bless.

28
00:01:03.366 --> 00:01:05.800
I started, hey, Xiao Ke

29
00:01:05.933 --> 00:01:08.900
2,000 yuan for two etiquette for tomorrow's banquet

30
00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:10.266
Shall we go and try
