00:00:12.166 --> 00:00:13.400
How is it? Is it solved?

2
00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.200
Don't worry, no one will find him again

3
00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:16.566
What are you afraid of?

4
00:00:16.566 --> 00:00:17.733
I'm not going to kill him.

5
00:00:17.733 --> 00:00:19.700
I just sent someone to send him away

6
00:00:19.866 --> 00:00:20.800
That would be fine.

7
00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.966
Didn't the waiter just let him leave that day?

8
00:00:22.966 --> 00:00:25.000
How do I know this dog thing took my money?

9
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.400
Don't work for me

10
00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:29.900
brother

11
00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:31.900
It's not bad for me

12
00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:33.933
What, your lord, let me go a lot

13
00:00:33.933 --> 00:00:36.066
Brother, I gave you a chance

14
00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:37.366
But you don't believe it.

15
00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:39.100
Is everything okay now?

16
00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.500
I should thank you for telling me this news in time.

17
00:00:41.566 --> 00:00:43.266
I was helping myself.

18
00:00:43.566 --> 00:00:46.733
Not bad, do you need to continue working with me?

19
00:00:46.733 --> 00:00:47.800
Don't you think

20
00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.966
I can't make up for the mistakes I made until now

21
00:00:49.966 --> 00:00:51.633
You still want me to do things for you?

22
00:00:51.666 --> 00:00:53.400
Why don't you need money?

23
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:54.866
Think carefully.

24
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.600
I am a growing grasshopper

25
00:00:56.733 --> 00:00:59.500
If something happens to me, don't think about it.
