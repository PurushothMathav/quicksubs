00:00:00.766 --> 00:00:02.100
You have a face

2
00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:03.300
Why can't I come?

3
00:00:03.866 --> 00:00:05.866
Really? Who is this guy?

4
00:00:05.866 --> 00:00:08.233
How do you dress like a bumpkin?

5
00:00:08.766 --> 00:00:09.600
him

6
00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:12.066
A trash that was taken out by the Shen family has arrived

7
00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:13.933
So he is what you said

8
00:00:13.933 --> 00:00:16.100
The lowly village woman from the mountain

9
00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:19.000
That Heavenly Fiend Lone Star who killed his family?

10
00:00:19.566 --> 00:00:21.800
It stinks to death for the whole family, so unlucky

11
00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.533
Who invited this funeral newcomer to the dinner party?

12
00:00:24.533 --> 00:00:27.133
I remember our dinner party has a threshold

13
00:00:27.133 --> 00:00:29.766
How did he get in? Who knows?

14
00:00:29.766 --> 00:00:32.000
Probably after being invited out the door

15
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.066
Did you hook up with someone again?

16
00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:38.100
Ye Zhen, I don't think you were beaten enough last time, right?

17
00:00:38.333 --> 00:00:40.000
If your mouth itches

18
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.800
I don't recommend rewarding you with a few more.

19
00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.900
Who dares to touch my granddaughter-in-law?

20
00:00:44.866 --> 00:00:45.666
probe

21
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.100
Grandma, I

22
00:00:52.533 --> 00:00:55.000
Hmph, you Heavenly Fiend Lone Star

23
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.766
You stay away from Zhenzhen

24
00:00:56.766 --> 00:00:58.600
Hum I tell you

25
00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.966
Only Zhenzhen is my future granddaughter-in-law

26
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.066
If you dare to bully her again, I will not forgive you.

27
00:01:05.066 --> 00:01:06.000
Come and get out

28
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.500
Get out of the school gate

29
00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:10.433
Have you run out of tricks?

30
00:01:10.466 --> 00:01:12.733
If I run out, it's my turn

31
00:01:12.733 --> 00:01:13.500
What do you want?

32
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.400
Don't worry, there are so many people, I won't hit you.

33
00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.533
I just want to be in front of everyone

34
00:01:19.533 --> 00:01:21.166
Demystify your trick

35
00:01:21.166 --> 00:01:22.200
What trick?

36
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.300
What nonsense are you talking about?
