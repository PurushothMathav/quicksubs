00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:09.100
Take these things you bought at roadside stalls

2
00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:10.066
please love

3
00:00:10.066 --> 00:00:11.633
You are so kind.

4
00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.200
What does it matter to you what I take?

5
00:00:14.866 --> 00:00:17.433
Sucho, I suggest you save it

6
00:00:17.533 --> 00:00:20.300
Ah Jing won't like you.

7
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.233
Don't like me, do you like you?

8
00:00:23.666 --> 00:00:26.566
I think you still don't understand the current situation

9
00:00:26.566 --> 00:00:28.233
I am the daughter of the Ye family

10
00:00:28.966 --> 00:00:30.866
The marriage of the Ye family and the Shen family

11
00:00:30.933 --> 00:00:32.766
Good for Aui's career

12
00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.766
And you, a charlatan

13
00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.266
Just rely on your tricks

14
00:00:38.266 --> 00:00:40.633
Let Ajing look at you twice more

15
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:42.600
Why are you laughing?

16
00:00:42.966 --> 00:00:46.066
I laugh at some people who are clearly incapable

17
00:00:46.066 --> 00:00:47.900
And unabashedly jealous

18
00:00:48.266 --> 00:00:49.000
Ye Chen

19
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.766
Did you know that if you do too many bad things, you will go to hell?

20
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.366
I advise you to start self-cultivation now

21
00:00:55.366 --> 00:00:56.433
Confidentiality matters

22
00:00:56.766 --> 00:00:57.800
You don't have to stop me.

23
00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.666
I will outlive you

24
00:00:59.966 --> 00:01:01.100
Not necessarily.

25
00:01:01.166 --> 00:01:02.666
The bad things you did

26
00:01:02.666 --> 00:01:04.200
I brought you everything long ago

27
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:06.600
Just because of the kindness in your grandfather

28
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.533
I helped you purify those evil forces

29
00:01:08.533 --> 00:01:09.500
You say

30
00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.466
If I poke all the things you did

31
00:01:12.466 --> 00:01:16.000
Would your grandfather send you to prison?

32
00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:19.633
Is it enough?

33
00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:22.600
Ah Jin, look at him, this shrew

34
00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:23.466
He also hit me

35
00:01:23.466 --> 00:01:25.833
You are evil enough

36
00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:28.600
Do you hear me?

37
00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.466
You take your junk and get out

38
00:01:30.466 --> 00:01:32.033
I'm talking about you.

39
00:01:33.066 --> 00:01:33.866
Ah Jin

40
00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.000
Why is this bastard robbing me of trash?

41
00:01:48.566 --> 00:01:52.366
Uncle, the land you told my dad about last time

42
00:01:52.366 --> 00:01:53.766
I can help you.
