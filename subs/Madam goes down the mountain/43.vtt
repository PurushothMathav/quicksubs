00:00:01.333 --> 00:00:02.133
Hey

2
00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:05.066
Did you bring that?

3
00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:07.066
What to bring

4
00:00:07.866 --> 00:00:10.566
It's okay to install an old driver

5
00:00:10.566 --> 00:00:13.200
I don't even know the most basic physiological knowledge

6
00:00:15.666 --> 00:00:17.466
Is that aunt awake?

7
00:00:18.466 --> 00:00:19.566
Nope.

8
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.900
Auntie's soul has been out of body for too long

9
00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:24.700
I gave all I could yesterday

10
00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:26.366
His soul has been found

11
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.433
The last wisp of soul is still missing

12
00:00:29.966 --> 00:00:32.666
Don't worry, I will definitely save Auntie.

13
00:00:39.166 --> 00:00:41.566
Miss Chen, I'm hungry.

14
00:00:41.566 --> 00:00:43.800
I thought you only needed Reiki

15
00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.033
That person is a person after all

16
00:00:48.533 --> 00:00:50.766
Come on, I'll take you to dinner

17
00:00:50.766 --> 00:00:53.666
I can't walk. I can't walk.

18
00:00:59.366 --> 00:01:00.400
So warm

19
00:01:14.933 --> 00:01:17.433
Whose scam are you looking for?

20
00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:20.166
Master Shen

21
00:01:20.166 --> 00:01:22.666
There is a businessperson named Xu Shenshang outside who said that he is looking for Su Xiaosan

22
00:01:22.866 --> 00:01:23.800
Xu Shensha

23
00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.700
You let him in just in time, I have something to do with him

24
00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:30.600
Hey, everyone I don't know in the future is empty enough

25
00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:34.866
Oh, yeah.
