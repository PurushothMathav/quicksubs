00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:01.733
Goddamn thing

2
00:00:01.733 --> 00:00:03.500
Even your cousin dares to do it

3
00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:06.466
Will you dare to deal with me next?

4
00:00:06.466 --> 00:00:07.566
The vibration is serious

5
00:00:07.566 --> 00:00:10.166
If I had the ability, your position

6
00:00:10.766 --> 00:00:12.200
It's been replaced long ago

7
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:13.300
Goddamn thing

8
00:00:13.933 --> 00:00:14.866
Humph

9
00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:19.100
You and your mother have the same bad temper.

10
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.333
The accumulated shares will be transferred to me within today

11
00:00:22.333 --> 00:00:25.800
Otherwise, don't forget what I have in my hand

12
00:00:30.366 --> 00:00:32.400
Mr. Shen, look at my use of blue jade spirit

13
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.033
How about the protective magic weapon made of stone? Does it look good?

14
00:00:38.333 --> 00:00:40.266
How did you make it hurt?

15
00:00:41.666 --> 00:00:43.166
Your liking for me

16
00:00:43.666 --> 00:00:44.866
Is it real or fake?

17
00:00:44.866 --> 00:00:45.866
Of course it's true.

18
00:00:45.866 --> 00:00:47.833
Your life is as important as mine

19
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.900
I really can't live without you

20
00:00:50.066 --> 00:00:53.100
Do you know how many people's blood I have on my hands?

21
00:00:54.333 --> 00:00:56.366
I don't know. I don't want to know.

22
00:00:56.366 --> 00:00:58.533
I just know that no matter what you do

23
00:00:58.533 --> 00:01:00.133
I will always be by your side

24
00:01:00.133 --> 00:01:02.500
I just want you to be safe and happy

25
00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:06.500
Go away and don't trust you people with evil intentions

26
00:01:09.366 --> 00:01:12.200
Dog men can't be soft or hard

27
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.666
What do you want?

28
00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.000
Forget it, bear it for a while

29
00:01:21.166 --> 00:01:23.100
Endure a year to be proud

30
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.700
Hahaha baby Sun Xu

31
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.366
Grandma, why did you buy so many things?

32
00:01:28.533 --> 00:01:31.066
These are the dresses I bought for you.

33
00:01:31.166 --> 00:01:33.800
In two days, it will be Ah Jin's uncle's birthday banquet.

34
00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.066
When the time comes, you will accompany him.

35
00:01:36.166 --> 00:01:38.333
Okay, it's all up to you.

36
00:01:38.333 --> 00:01:40.966
Hmm, I can't handle the provincial repair police

37
00:01:40.966 --> 00:01:42.300
Can't handle the old lady
