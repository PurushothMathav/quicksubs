00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.200
Keep your voice down. Support's on the way

2
00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:05.633
What responsibility?

3
00:00:07.466 --> 00:00:09.200
Boss, there are police outside

4
00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.666
Brothers, the police are here, run away

5
00:00:11.666 --> 00:00:12.966
Run through the back door

6
00:00:13.733 --> 00:00:16.866
Boss, I'm waiting for you outside, bro

7
00:00:20.266 --> 00:00:21.300
They ran out the back door

8
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:22.233
Arrest quickly

9
00:00:24.166 --> 00:00:26.600
So you're undercover for the police

10
00:00:26.866 --> 00:00:28.666
Little Junior Sister, long time no see!

11
00:00:29.333 --> 00:00:32.466
I just heard someone call you wife.

12
00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.666
Did you get the seven violins back?

13
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.966
Miss Shen, listen to my explanation

14
00:00:40.966 --> 00:00:43.366
Me, so you've been lying to me these days.

15
00:00:43.366 --> 00:00:45.633
Really? I didn't lie to you.

16
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:49.233
I oops my feet are soft

17
00:00:57.533 --> 00:00:59.900
It's so mushy to talk about love

18
00:01:04.333 --> 00:01:05.133
suqiao

19
00:01:05.766 --> 00:01:07.033
You lied to me again.

20
00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.000
suqiao

21
00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.900
suqiao

22
00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:13.966
Are you still angry?

23
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:20.733
I didn't lie to you.

24
00:01:20.733 --> 00:01:22.666
I got my passion back.

25
00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.900
I thought I was interested in you

26
00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:31.166
Afraid that my feelings for you will be mixed with other things

27
00:01:31.666 --> 00:01:33.433
But I'm pretty sure now

28
00:01:33.566 --> 00:01:36.200
I like you.
