00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.266
Not good, it's the provincial repair police, hahaha.

2
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.200
What a shock!

3
00:00:07.266 --> 00:00:08.333
Don't come here

4
00:00:08.333 --> 00:00:09.566
Or I'll kill him

5
00:00:10.066 --> 00:00:11.333
Get me a car right away

6
00:00:11.333 --> 00:00:14.433
Why are you still standing at the door?

7
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:19.100
Still don't admit it, do you?

8
00:00:22.533 --> 00:00:23.866
Hahaha

9
00:00:24.466 --> 00:00:25.500
I did it

10
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:27.600
Miss Shen

11
00:00:28.333 --> 00:00:30.733
You are just a wandering outside

12
00:00:30.733 --> 00:00:32.266
Orphans for more than ten years

13
00:00:32.533 --> 00:00:34.366
If my dad hadn't saved you

14
00:00:34.366 --> 00:00:36.766
You're still in a cage with those beasts

15
00:00:36.766 --> 00:00:38.166
Do you eat dry water?

16
00:00:39.533 --> 00:00:41.366
What an animal you are!

17
00:00:41.366 --> 00:00:43.000
You dare to touch your grandma

18
00:00:43.466 --> 00:00:45.166
Hahahaha

19
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.900
I am the only reporter in Shunjiang

20
00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:50.766
But the old woman

21
00:00:51.533 --> 00:00:53.700
I have become so fond of you

22
00:00:53.733 --> 00:00:56.300
Since you are so biased

23
00:00:56.533 --> 00:00:58.866
Then you will die with him

24
00:00:58.866 --> 00:01:00.000
court death

25
00:01:00.866 --> 00:01:02.300
Miss Su is back

26
00:01:03.933 --> 00:01:06.866
Then there's no need for you to live

27
00:01:09.166 --> 00:01:10.866
Mr. Shen, don't kill anyone

28
00:01:10.866 --> 00:01:12.433
You have to stop killing people.

29
00:01:12.466 --> 00:01:13.266
You let go

30
00:01:14.066 --> 00:01:15.466
I have seen your life form

31
00:01:15.533 --> 00:01:16.700
If you cut blood again

32
00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.800
You will be killed by the night battle

33
00:01:19.333 --> 00:01:21.166
Am I not afraid of death?

34
00:01:23.466 --> 00:01:24.666
But I'm afraid

35
00:01:27.333 --> 00:01:30.866
Mr. Shen, I don't want you to die, don't kill him

36
00:01:31.066 --> 00:01:32.700
I have a way to find your mother

37
00:01:42.966 --> 00:01:44.033
How?

38
00:01:53.466 --> 00:01:55.433
I gave him a snack

39
00:01:55.466 --> 00:01:57.866
We can use him to cover Shen Changzong's words

40
00:01:58.466 --> 00:01:59.900
Ok hmm

41
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.666
It's just going to happen, but that's okay.

42
00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:04.966
This is the opposite

43
00:02:04.966 --> 00:02:07.633
Compared with the reverse incident caused by the murder of Shen Xiu police

44
00:02:07.666 --> 00:02:09.000
Not worth mentioning at all

45
00:02:14.866 --> 00:02:17.300
God help me

46
00:02:17.466 --> 00:02:20.100
This man spends every day trying to kill himself

47
00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.466
How have I survived this year?
