00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:02.566
People are not dead yet, why cry?

2
00:00:02.566 --> 00:00:05.166
Mr. Shen, I thought you were dead

3
00:00:05.166 --> 00:00:08.233
If you die, I really can't live

4
00:00:08.966 --> 00:00:11.266
Curse me less, I don't die so easily

5
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.666
And don't let me see him cry next time

6
00:00:18.166 --> 00:00:20.866
Miss Su, don't worry about Master Shen

7
00:00:20.866 --> 00:00:22.366
Just those punks

8
00:00:22.466 --> 00:00:25.266
He is not a match for Master Shen at all

9
00:00:25.266 --> 00:00:26.166
Miss Su

10
00:00:26.266 --> 00:00:30.466
The one you gave me last time was amazing

11
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:32.000
Give it to me again.

12
00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.600
I only give Mr. Shen free

13
00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.300
Everyone else wants money

14
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.766
5,000 bucks a Fulu.

15
00:00:38.966 --> 00:00:41.266
Do you want money? Arrange

16
00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:43.566
Mr. Shen

17
00:00:45.566 --> 00:00:47.066
Hey, what about people?

18
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:48.566
Hey wait for me

19
00:00:48.566 --> 00:00:50.366
Don't get in the car

20
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:51.733
Mr. Shen

21
00:00:51.733 --> 00:00:54.500
I have investigated the evil on that rooftop.

22
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.766
But now we need to go to the hospital to find Xiao Mao.

23
00:00:56.766 --> 00:00:59.366
Only by finding Xiaomao can we find any black hands

24
00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.266
Alipay 10,000 yuan

25
00:01:07.466 --> 00:01:08.800
I didn't expect Tang Yi

26
00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:10.700
It was refreshing.

27
00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:11.833
Are you short of money?

28
00:01:12.066 --> 00:01:14.300
Of course, who's going to have a hard time with money?

29
00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:15.500
Since you are short of money

30
00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.166
Why don't you take my money?

31
00:01:18.566 --> 00:01:21.000
Of course I won't say who I like

32
00:01:21.566 --> 00:01:24.466
Besides, if we get married in the future

33
00:01:24.466 --> 00:01:26.233
What's yours is mine.

34
00:01:26.466 --> 00:01:28.666
I suggest you go to the hospital to see your brain
