00:00:00.566 --> 00:00:03.400
Mr. Shen, he said that the Ye family will have a banquet tomorrow

2
00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:05.066
Invite me to come with you

3
00:00:05.066 --> 00:00:06.633
How exciting!

4
00:00:06.766 --> 00:00:08.200
No sleep at night

5
00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:09.466
At my doorstep

6
00:00:09.466 --> 00:00:11.966
Invite my fiancee to a dinner party

7
00:00:12.266 --> 00:00:13.400
Your fiancee

8
00:00:14.366 --> 00:00:16.400
Aren't you already engaged to the Ye family?

9
00:00:17.066 --> 00:00:20.400
Xiao Qiao, you can't be deceived by this kind of person

10
00:00:20.666 --> 00:00:22.066
Tie yourself up

11
00:00:22.066 --> 00:00:24.733
Xiao Qiao, you can tell me if you have any difficulties.

12
00:00:24.733 --> 00:00:26.066
I can help you.

13
00:00:26.366 --> 00:00:27.966
You don't have to compromise.

14
00:00:28.533 --> 00:00:29.800
With this kind of person

15
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
You need him to save your life

16
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:33.766
Help him with what?

17
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.800
Oops ok

18
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:39.900
I have no trouble

19
00:00:40.066 --> 00:00:41.600
He is not engaged to the Ye family either

20
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:42.833
This is a misunderstanding.

21
00:00:45.566 --> 00:00:47.200
I know you don't like night scenes

22
00:00:47.366 --> 00:00:48.700
But for grandma

23
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.166
Please bear with me.

24
00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.633
I'll go to the party by myself tomorrow night

25
00:00:52.666 --> 00:00:54.466
None of you need to come with me

26
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.966
Remember not to show up tomorrow

27
00:00:57.066 --> 00:00:58.666
I'm afraid Ye Zhen will suspect

28
00:00:58.933 --> 00:01:00.966
We'll provoke him then.

29
00:01:00.966 --> 00:01:03.233
He then made some other means to grandma

30
00:01:03.333 --> 00:01:04.666
That would be troublesome

31
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.733
The Empress may also appear nearby tomorrow

32
00:01:09.733 --> 00:01:11.366
You keep staring around

33
00:01:11.933 --> 00:01:13.200
OK, I see.

34
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.100
Is there a problem?

35
00:01:17.566 --> 00:01:18.800
It's a promise then.

36
00:01:22.366 --> 00:01:23.800
I read that right?

37
00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.700
Miss Su still has a reason to come to the dinner party
