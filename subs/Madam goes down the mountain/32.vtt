1
00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:01.333
Qiao'er didn't lie to you.

2
00:00:01.333 --> 00:00:04.366
You are as important to him as your life

3
00:00:04.366 --> 00:00:06.866
Although my apprentice is strong

4
00:00:06.866 --> 00:00:08.400
But my health is not good

5
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.166
Reiki every death

6
00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:11.600
He will pass out

7
00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:14.400
I can't recover after sleeping for several days

8
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:15.633
With you by my side

9
00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:17.200
He will be relieved

10
00:00:18.533 --> 00:00:20.033
What do you mean?

11
00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.166
I can give him Reiki

12
00:00:22.933 --> 00:00:24.866
Then why did he faint?

13
00:00:24.933 --> 00:00:28.166
Because you hate him so much

14
00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:30.800
Causing his reiki to flow back

15
00:00:30.866 --> 00:00:32.933
Qiao'er is stupid sometimes

16
00:00:32.933 --> 00:00:35.333
But he's sincere to you.

17
00:00:35.333 --> 00:00:37.700
He wants to suck some reiki from you

18
00:00:37.933 --> 00:00:38.900
To repay you

19
00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:41.666
He will stand in front of you in any danger.

20
00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.366
Mr. Shen, be careful

21
00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:46.100
He is young

22
00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:47.100
Don't know anything.

23
00:00:47.133 --> 00:00:48.666
You are the world

24
00:00:49.333 --> 00:00:50.800
The most special person

25
00:00:50.966 --> 00:00:53.100
So he wants to marry you.

26
00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.033
I want to stay by your side forever

27
00:00:56.733 --> 00:00:58.300
If you really don't like it

28
00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.433
Just be patient.

29
00:01:00.733 --> 00:01:02.100
When he is well

30
00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.266
I'll take him back to the mountain

31
00:01:05.733 --> 00:01:08.400
I can promise to give him change.

32
00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.000
The condition is to help me find my mother

33
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.900
Yes, yes.

34
00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:14.000
It's no problem to find someone, if you can't find it

35
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.400
I'll let everyone in this broken dojo

36
00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:19.266
Let's go pick up junk together

37
00:01:20.666 --> 00:01:23.066
Master, why are you here?

38
00:01:24.933 --> 00:01:26.333
Qiao Er, you can do it

39
00:01:26.333 --> 00:01:28.900
I told Mr. Shen everything about you

40
00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:30.566
Mr. Shen has forgiven you

41
00:01:30.566 --> 00:01:32.700
Why don't you support each other?

42
00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:33.800
Oh, really?

43
00:01:34.766 --> 00:01:38.266
Mr. Shen, have you forgiven me? Look at your expression

44
00:01:42.533 --> 00:01:45.066
It's like a gas pump

45
00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.466
Master, did you really tell him everything?

46
00:01:48.666 --> 00:01:51.833
Wife, I have to marry him. Shh
