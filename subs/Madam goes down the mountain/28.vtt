00:00:06.133 --> 00:00:08.766
Grandpa, what's wrong with me?

2
00:00:09.466 --> 00:00:10.566
Oh, dear.

3
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.500
Miss Su, you are a god

4
00:00:14.566 --> 00:00:17.733
Zhenzhen, he is your savior

5
00:00:17.733 --> 00:00:20.666
Miss Su, don't hurry up and thank you

6
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.500
No thanks

7
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.900
Just don't forget our original promise

8
00:00:25.266 --> 00:00:27.366
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

9
00:00:27.366 --> 00:00:28.666
Is it raining okay?

10
00:00:28.666 --> 00:00:30.833
You invite me to go

11
00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:32.733
What did you promise him?

12
00:00:32.733 --> 00:00:34.300
Don't be fooled by him.

13
00:00:44.133 --> 00:00:46.233
Unit 1: Between Us 2,000

14
00:00:49.966 --> 00:00:51.100
Grandpa

15
00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:52.300
Let's go out first

16
00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.533
I have something to say to Miss Su

17
00:00:55.533 --> 00:00:58.500
Well, then you can talk slowly.

18
00:00:59.133 --> 00:01:01.233
Discord is unreasonable to Miss Su

19
00:01:07.666 --> 00:01:08.133
I see.

20
00:01:08.133 --> 00:01:10.333
You didn't ask me to stay to thank me

21
00:01:10.333 --> 00:01:13.066
Come on, you really guessed it right.

22
00:01:13.166 --> 00:01:15.066
I just wanted to tell you

23
00:01:15.066 --> 00:01:16.566
Stay away from Ah Jin

24
00:01:16.566 --> 00:01:18.166
You don't deserve him

25
00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:21.533
A talent like you is not worthy of Police Shen Xiu at all

26
00:01:21.533 --> 00:01:22.933
The things you think you do

27
00:01:22.933 --> 00:01:24.266
Nobody knows?

28
00:01:24.266 --> 00:01:25.300
What do you mean?

29
00:01:25.533 --> 00:01:28.600
I saw your mourning platform when I rescued you just now

30
00:01:28.966 --> 00:01:31.500
Whether you indirectly killed your mother

31
00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.666
Or the things you did to Shen Xiu

32
00:01:33.666 --> 00:01:35.366
I can see it clearly

33
00:01:40.133 --> 00:01:42.700
Dang dang gouged out his eyes here

34
00:01:44.333 --> 00:01:46.100
After I taught him a lesson

35
00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.066
The money is yours.

36
00:01:52.266 --> 00:01:54.000
The reason why he can make it easy now

37
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.966
It's because he lost part of his memory

38
00:01:55.966 --> 00:01:58.366
Do you think if he knew all the truth

39
00:01:58.366 --> 00:01:59.800
What would he do to you?

40
00:01:59.866 --> 00:02:00.933
You bitch

41
00:02:00.933 --> 00:02:02.666
How can you drag me down?

42
00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:04.866
I warn you.

43
00:02:04.866 --> 00:02:06.966
If you dare to rest again

44
00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:09.500
I'll let you go to hell
