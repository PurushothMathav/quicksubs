00:00:01.666 --> 00:00:04.900
Mr. Xu, you have a way to save him, right?

2
00:00:06.266 --> 00:00:07.600
I beg you

3
00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.666
I beg you, save him

4
00:00:10.066 --> 00:00:12.566
I would give my life

5
00:00:13.333 --> 00:00:15.300
There's a way to save him

6
00:00:15.666 --> 00:00:18.700
But his spirit bone has been broken

7
00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:20.000
Want to save him

8
00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:22.633
Maybe I need a drug addiction

9
00:00:22.766 --> 00:00:23.766
What addiction?

10
00:00:24.666 --> 00:00:25.700
Your elixir

11
00:00:27.933 --> 00:00:29.700
Lingdan is like this

12
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.366
You two are connected

13
00:00:31.366 --> 00:00:32.400
To Linggu

14
00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:33.933
Can provide you with reiki

15
00:00:33.933 --> 00:00:35.800
And the elixir condensed by your Reiki

16
00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.466
It can also help him repair Reiki

17
00:00:41.733 --> 00:00:44.233
Xiao Qiao, you have to think about it

18
00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.666
Condensing spirit pills requires a lot of spiritual energy

19
00:00:47.133 --> 00:00:48.300
He is now

20
00:00:49.133 --> 00:00:50.866
His spirit bones are now damaged

21
00:00:50.866 --> 00:00:52.966
I can't provide you with reiki anymore

22
00:00:52.966 --> 00:00:55.633
You will die like this

23
00:00:56.866 --> 00:00:58.800
He's doing this because of me

24
00:01:00.566 --> 00:01:01.566
I'm not afraid

25
00:01:28.933 --> 00:01:30.100
Miss Chen

26
00:01:30.866 --> 00:01:32.900
I can't forget you

27
00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:34.633
Wake up quickly, okay?

28
00:01:35.666 --> 00:01:37.100
Miss Chen

29
00:01:42.366 --> 00:01:47.066
Dr. Shen Qiujie, doctor, come to the doctor
