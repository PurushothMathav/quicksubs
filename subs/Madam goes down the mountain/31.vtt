00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:01.300
What do you want?

2
00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:04.300
Ah!

3
00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:06.633
Mr. Chen said

4
00:00:07.333 --> 00:00:08.700
What is your purpose in approaching me?

5
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.866
Do you want my life or my money?

6
00:00:10.966 --> 00:00:13.066
I didn't kill you.

7
00:00:13.133 --> 00:00:15.666
You're lying to me again. I'm not lying to you.

8
00:00:15.733 --> 00:00:18.566
I do have my own purpose in contacting you

9
00:00:18.566 --> 00:00:21.266
But... but I never meant to hurt you.

10
00:00:21.266 --> 00:00:22.933
I've heard too much about that.

11
00:00:22.933 --> 00:00:24.400
How could this be?

12
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.600
Why would my aura ruin that?

13
00:00:27.133 --> 00:00:28.966
Is it the Han righteousness of self-cultivation?

14
00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.000
Will take away my fame

15
00:00:32.266 --> 00:00:33.066
Let me in!

16
00:00:35.266 --> 00:00:36.966
Go let me in

17
00:00:36.966 --> 00:00:39.033
I'm going in to see my precious apprentice

18
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.000
He is your apprentice

19
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.100
He is my apprentice

20
00:00:42.133 --> 00:00:43.933
I also asked him to come down the mountain to find you

21
00:00:43.933 --> 00:00:45.266
You've grown so big

22
00:00:45.466 --> 00:00:48.200
When you were a child, your parents took you up the mountain to burn incense

23
00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:51.400
Why did you say you sent him to find me?
