00:00:00.933 --> 00:00:02.566
Are you going to come to me today?

2
00:00:02.566 --> 00:00:04.100
I was going to find you too

3
00:00:05.566 --> 00:00:07.066
What is it? What happened?

4
00:00:07.066 --> 00:00:08.166
It's Shen Changzong

5
00:00:08.333 --> 00:00:09.666
I'm going to interrogate him in the morning

6
00:00:09.666 --> 00:00:11.100
Only to find him dead

7
00:00:11.466 --> 00:00:14.233
And it was a tragic death

8
00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:16.300
Eyes and tongue are gone

9
00:00:17.866 --> 00:00:19.366
Was forcibly sacrificed

10
00:00:19.366 --> 00:00:20.900
Sacrifice

11
00:00:21.933 --> 00:00:24.833
The magic practiced by the Empress is originally a forbidden magic

12
00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.533
He used Shen Changzong and Ye Zhen

13
00:00:26.533 --> 00:00:27.933
Want to deal with my psychology

14
00:00:27.933 --> 00:00:29.500
Help them fulfill their wishes

15
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.933
The price is their lives

16
00:00:31.933 --> 00:00:33.366
So the Empress died

17
00:00:33.366 --> 00:00:34.966
He and Ye Zhen both died

18
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.066
That's right, but it's not a big deal that he's dead

19
00:00:40.066 --> 00:00:42.566
It's just that you asked the help to ask.

20
00:00:42.566 --> 00:00:44.366
About Auntie's Soul

21
00:00:44.466 --> 00:00:45.500
He hasn't said it yet.

22
00:00:47.933 --> 00:00:49.433
Then I can only drop the powder myself.

23
00:00:51.933 --> 00:00:53.766
By the way, your leader has a lot of information.

24
00:00:53.766 --> 00:00:55.233
Can you lend me a look?

25
00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:56.400
Wait a minute.

26
00:00:56.933 --> 00:00:59.100
The basics are all here

27
00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:14.100
Who?

28
00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.066
It's over, this uncle is afraid to be angry again

29
00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:27.266
Please help me find the information first.

30
00:01:27.266 --> 00:01:29.066
Can I come back to you then?

31
00:01:29.066 --> 00:01:30.166
What am I looking for?

32
00:01:31.066 --> 00:01:33.000
If you like this, you can send it to me then.

33
00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.600
Did you hear what he said to me?

34
00:01:38.966 --> 00:01:41.000
He asked me who I was.

35
00:01:41.333 --> 00:01:43.700
And that very impatient tone

36
00:01:43.933 --> 00:01:44.866
Make it seem

37
00:01:44.866 --> 00:01:48.033
It wasn't him who forced me to call before

38
00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.300
How could it be done before, but not now?

39
00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:55.433
Have you lost patience and interest in me?

40
00:01:55.933 --> 00:01:58.200
Now I don't even want to pretend

41
00:01:58.966 --> 00:02:00.800
How to do it is scary

42
00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.366
Who can help me?

43
00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.900
Answer the phone

44
00:02:10.733 --> 00:02:13.033
Madam oh madam

45
00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.600
I'm with Master Shen and Wang

46
00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:15.566
Master Shen just woke up

47
00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.066
If you have anything to say, you can tell him directly.

48
00:02:19.166 --> 00:02:20.400
Oh, it's okay.

49
00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:21.366
I just wanted to ask

50
00:02:21.366 --> 00:02:23.533
How is our Mr. Shen doing?

51
00:02:23.533 --> 00:02:25.866
If it's okay, I won't talk to him on the phone

52
00:02:25.866 --> 00:02:26.800
