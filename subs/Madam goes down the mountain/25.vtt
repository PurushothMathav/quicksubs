00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:04.166
Sister Shen Ye

2
00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:07.666
I didn't stop you, go out first

3
00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:12.800
Why are you here?

4
00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.966
Archie

5
00:00:14.333 --> 00:00:16.933
I missed you every day when I was abroad

6
00:00:16.933 --> 00:00:19.466
I'll pick you up as soon as I return home in April.

7
00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:21.233
Go out if you have nothing to do

8
00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.033
You are not allowed to enter my office without my consent in the future

9
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.566
Angie, please stop kidding me.

10
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.733
I won't leave this time when I come back.

11
00:00:30.733 --> 00:00:32.833
I will always be with you, okay? I don't need it.

12
00:00:34.066 --> 00:00:36.900
Archie, if you don't leave, I'll find someone to carry you away.

13
00:00:37.933 --> 00:00:40.266
Shen Yan, your fiancee

14
00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.100
Miss Su is coming for you

15
00:00:43.133 --> 00:00:44.266
Send him in.

16
00:00:44.733 --> 00:00:46.833
Fiancee Ajie

17
00:00:47.066 --> 00:00:48.300
How could you be a fiancee?

18
00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:59.166
Who are you? Stay away from Shen Xiujing

19
00:01:01.133 --> 00:01:02.366
Are you Miss Su?

20
00:01:02.366 --> 00:01:04.633
I am Ah Jin's childhood sweetheart

21
00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:06.500
My name is Ye Zhen

22
00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:19.466
Miss Ye, you have been hit by five grains

23
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.066
If not dealt with ASAP

24
00:01:21.066 --> 00:01:22.900
Death penalty in three days

25
00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:25.000
Miss Su, you cursed me to death the first time you met me

26
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.266
Is it too much?

27
00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.033
Sister, did you hear what he said?

28
00:01:29.266 --> 00:01:30.633
He said you hit the grain

29
00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:33.733
What drum or not?

30
00:01:33.733 --> 00:01:35.833
You even believe in this kind of quack

31
00:01:39.466 --> 00:01:41.933
Miss Ye, I advise you to go back quickly

32
00:01:41.933 --> 00:01:44.666
Don't stain your demonic aura on Mr. Shen

33
00:01:44.666 --> 00:01:47.166
It's not too late for you to go back and prepare for the funeral now

34
00:01:47.966 --> 00:01:49.266
You dare to kill me

35
00:01:50.133 --> 00:01:51.466
You wait for me.

36
00:01:54.933 --> 00:01:57.000
Why are you jealous?

37
00:01:57.766 --> 00:01:59.566
Am I just worried about your safety?

38
00:01:59.566 --> 00:02:02.266
Not thin if you want me to be a job lady

39
00:02:02.266 --> 00:02:03.066
shut up
