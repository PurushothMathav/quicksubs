00:00:00.533 --> 00:00:01.833
What are you nervous about?

2
00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:05.866
I don't know why I got nervous

3
00:00:05.866 --> 00:00:09.200
Help! Why do I want to see him so much?

4
00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:13.233
Could it be that you have grown celery and your heart has also grown up?

5
00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:14.500
Sucho

6
00:00:15.133 --> 00:00:16.666
Ah come here

7
00:00:17.066 --> 00:00:18.200
Let you charge it.

8
00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:20.466
Well, it's okay, no need.

9
00:00:20.766 --> 00:00:22.666
Your body is just right

10
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.266
That I remember I have something else to do

11
00:00:29.266 --> 00:00:32.166
I'll go out first, you rest first, ah?

12
00:00:37.533 --> 00:00:39.000
Regarding the divorce certificate

13
00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:40.533
I have found the calligraphy for you.

14
00:00:40.533 --> 00:00:42.933
But that's the first half.

15
00:00:42.933 --> 00:00:45.500
I don't know who took the second half away.

16
00:00:51.466 --> 00:00:52.266
Mr. Qu

17
00:00:52.266 --> 00:00:55.066
Do you know what it's like to like someone?

18
00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.466
You mean Shen Xiuji?

19
00:01:01.066 --> 00:01:03.033
I wasn't passionate before.

20
00:01:03.066 --> 00:01:04.800
I think Shen Xiujing is nice to me

21
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.266
Just to take advantage of me

22
00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:08.000
But I just know now

23
00:01:08.266 --> 00:01:10.200
In fact, he really likes me

24
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.466
He was even willing to be cramped for me

25
00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.300
But I don't know if I'm right

26
00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:17.200
What kind of emotion does he have?

27
00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:18.466
Is grateful

28
00:01:19.266 --> 00:01:20.233
Or pity?

29
00:01:20.966 --> 00:01:23.633
It can't be love anyway
