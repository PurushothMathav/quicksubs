00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:01.000
This

2
00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.266
How can Qian Weiwei have such a rich mother?

3
00:00:03.266 --> 00:00:06.033
Boss, how did you meet our Wei Wei?

4
00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:08.566
This girl has a deep impression of her

5
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.633
Let's start five years ago.

6
00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:12.233
He comes to my place every day to try the piano

7
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:13.866
It takes half an hour to try

8
00:00:13.866 --> 00:00:15.300
Play and sing

9
00:00:15.366 --> 00:00:16.600
Can't even drive away

10
00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:19.433
He also said that his idol is a fixed language

11
00:00:19.466 --> 00:00:21.600
To be a singer like a fixed language

12
00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.733
Boss, can you say more?

13
00:00:23.733 --> 00:00:25.300
We want to know more about the baby.

14
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:26.600
After this?

15
00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.666
About three years ago.

16
00:00:28.766 --> 00:00:30.566
He held a large plastic bottle

17
00:00:30.766 --> 00:00:33.300
It's all a few cents and a few dollars inside.

18
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.500
This patchwork is only more than 400

19
00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:36.800
Say buy an electronic organ

20
00:00:37.133 --> 00:00:39.733
My cheapest one is more than 800.

21
00:00:39.733 --> 00:00:41.500
There's no way to go back

22
00:00:41.533 --> 00:00:43.200
That's another half a year.

23
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.800
Finally got it together

24
00:00:45.266 --> 00:00:46.700
Crush other people's dreams

25
00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:47.666
Fix yourself

26
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:48.566
Pardon me?

27
00:00:48.566 --> 00:00:50.700
You know, families like mine

28
00:00:50.766 --> 00:00:52.600
How many tons did you ask Wuxi?

29
00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.200
How many nice things to say?

30
00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.666
To have such an age

31
00:01:05.466 --> 00:01:06.633
You don't know.

32
00:01:07.066 --> 00:01:09.700
How could you possibly know to say

33
00:01:11.333 --> 00:01:12.266
Sorry.

34
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.700
I just don't get it.

35
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:15.966
Your family is so rich

36
00:01:15.966 --> 00:01:18.033
Then why did you sell him for his money?

37
00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.266
Sold what is that

38
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.633
Sold him his money
