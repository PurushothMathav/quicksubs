00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:02.800
No, sorry, sorry.

2
00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:05.066
I was afraid of being late, so I left in a hurry. It's alright.

3
00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.400
You are Mr. Gu Yun

4
00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.066
You know me?

5
00:00:09.133 --> 00:00:11.366
I just watched your performance

6
00:00:11.366 --> 00:00:13.166
So I decided to learn vocal music

7
00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:15.033
My dream is to be like you

8
00:00:15.133 --> 00:00:17.366
To be a top singer?

9
00:00:17.366 --> 00:00:18.466
I see.

10
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.500
I will definitely study hard.

11
00:00:20.666 --> 00:00:22.633
You'd rather be a role model and study hard

12
00:00:26.266 --> 00:00:27.833
If life is still alive

13
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:29.900
I guess it's that big.

14
00:00:34.333 --> 00:00:35.666
Hey, how is that possible?

15
00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.166
Both of their mothers are women's boys

16
00:00:38.166 --> 00:00:40.800
That's an international top soprano singer

17
00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.166
The first place in the competition must not be sweet, right?

18
00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:45.566
I envy him so much

19
00:00:45.566 --> 00:00:47.100
And such a handsome brother

20
00:00:47.866 --> 00:00:48.700
younger sister

21
00:00:49.333 --> 00:00:50.700
It can be used as a dormitory overnight

22
00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:51.800
See you later

23
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.066
Bye bye go bye

24
00:00:58.333 --> 00:01:00.400
Some people are born to be protagonists

25
00:01:00.666 --> 00:01:02.166
And some people?

26
00:01:02.166 --> 00:01:05.100
You can only talk about others behind their backs like a dragon

27
00:01:05.966 --> 00:01:07.633
How to go or not

28
00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.100
You seem to think only of Principal Gu

29
00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:38.033
Books that can be sung

30
00:01:38.333 --> 00:01:39.600
Don't tell me

31
00:01:39.866 --> 00:01:41.700
This sound quality, this color

32
00:01:42.166 --> 00:01:44.100
Or can he forget himself?

33
00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:45.700
But this teacher is not Gu

34
00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.500
Did the principal prepare it for his daughter?

35
00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:48.800
How did he do it?

36
00:01:52.166 --> 00:01:54.666
This classroom is for me alone.

37
00:01:55.966 --> 00:01:57.600
How dare you use it?

38
00:01:57.666 --> 00:01:58.900
Excuse me?

39
00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:00.066
I am a freshman.

40
00:02:00.166 --> 00:02:01.500
I'm not very clear.

41
00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:04.800
I don't know. I'm looking at you.

42
00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:06.500
What's up?

43
00:02:07.366 --> 00:02:08.900
What is my hand doing?
