00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:03.100
Brother, have you seen my electronic organ?

2
00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:03.900
What the hell?

3
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.733
It's what I usually practice with

4
00:00:05.733 --> 00:00:07.966
I used to keep it in the attic where I lived

5
00:00:07.966 --> 00:00:10.100
Oh, that shit

6
00:00:10.733 --> 00:00:11.700
I was tight two days ago.

7
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.066
What was sold?

8
00:00:13.066 --> 00:00:15.300
You sell the crap and sell it

9
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:17.066
They take up so much space and are so noisy!

10
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.866
It was the only thing I had to study music with.

11
00:00:18.866 --> 00:00:20.166
How can you sell it?

12
00:00:20.533 --> 00:00:22.833
If you sell it, you can start playing the game.

13
00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.000
Even your usual salary

14
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.900
Why are you even selling my stuff?

15
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:32.700
Ah what are you, your whole family is Lao Tzu

16
00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:33.966
I can buy whatever I want to sell

17
00:00:33.966 --> 00:00:36.500
No matter how ugly you are, I will sell you tomorrow, okay?

18
00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.866
Are you and your mother really my relatives?

19
00:00:39.866 --> 00:00:41.000
relatives

20
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.000
Relatives, of course.

21
00:00:45.533 --> 00:00:46.766
See you later
