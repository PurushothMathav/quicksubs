00:00:01.933 --> 00:00:04.900
Can the boss lend me an electronic organ?

2
00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:06.000
Why is it you again?

3
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.266
How many times do I have to tell you?

4
00:00:07.266 --> 00:00:09.500
My piano is only for sale

5
00:00:09.733 --> 00:00:12.666
My dream since I was a child was to be a famous singer

6
00:00:12.666 --> 00:00:14.333
I was really desperate.

7
00:00:14.333 --> 00:00:16.066
Otherwise I wouldn't have opened this mouth

8
00:00:16.133 --> 00:00:19.033
Little girl, how much is your dream worth?

9
00:00:19.133 --> 00:00:21.666
Can you pay for the water and electricity rent in my store?

10
00:00:22.566 --> 00:00:24.200
Boss, I am

11
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.366
The first place result was admitted to Qingya College

12
00:00:26.366 --> 00:00:28.300
The prize money for the Haicheng Competition is 1 million

13
00:00:28.533 --> 00:00:29.500
As long as I win

14
00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.466
I'll give you 10,000 bonus

15
00:00:31.866 --> 00:00:33.500
Are you serious?

16
00:00:33.766 --> 00:00:35.300
We can stand up

17
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.533
Okay, but let's talk about ugly things ahead.

18
00:00:39.533 --> 00:00:41.266
My money is not cheap

19
00:00:41.266 --> 00:00:43.400
If it is damaged, you have to ask the original price for compensation.

20
00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:44.666
Hmm, no problem.

21
00:00:44.666 --> 00:00:46.200
Thank you boss

22
00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.533
Saint Saint is coming to your birthday again

23
00:01:53.533 --> 00:01:55.966
Where the hell are you after 13 years?

24
00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:00.033
This melody
