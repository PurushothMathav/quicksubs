00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:01.433
This classmate

2
00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:03.800
Our game is over here

3
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:05.466
Sorry teacher

4
00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:06.600
I'm late.

5
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.166
Can you give me another chance?

6
00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.200
The most important thing in a game is to be punctual

7
00:00:12.333 --> 00:00:14.366
Now our game is over.

8
00:00:14.366 --> 00:00:15.800
You have a chance.

9
00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:18.600
Teacher, I beg you.

10
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.700
This game is really important to me

11
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:23.700
My dream since I was a child was to be a soldier singer

12
00:00:23.866 --> 00:00:25.700
If you can't participate in this competition

13
00:00:25.866 --> 00:00:27.300
I'm about to be kicked out of school

14
00:00:27.566 --> 00:00:28.966
Can you give me another chance?

15
00:00:28.966 --> 00:00:30.700
This really is my last chance.

16
00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:32.600
Those who came to the competition today

17
00:00:32.933 --> 00:00:34.333
Everyone has a dream

18
00:00:34.333 --> 00:00:37.066
Now that you know how important this game is

19
00:00:37.066 --> 00:00:38.900
Why are you still late?

20
00:00:38.933 --> 00:00:40.900
Make yourself like this

21
00:00:40.966 --> 00:00:42.033
Exactly.

22
00:00:42.133 --> 00:00:44.433
It means you don't take this game seriously at all

23
00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.066
It is a melody that has been written in life

24
00:01:19.266 --> 00:01:20.400
I remember it clearly.

25
00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.466
Hurry up and find Shengsheng
