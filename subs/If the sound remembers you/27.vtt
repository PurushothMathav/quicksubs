00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:13.900
Why does this sound so sweet?

2
00:00:13.933 --> 00:00:15.066
Is it him?

3
00:00:16.766 --> 00:00:17.566
How come?

4
00:00:17.566 --> 00:00:18.966
Why is there no one left?

5
00:00:19.266 --> 00:00:20.200
I don't know what's wrong

6
00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:21.833
Was someone singing here just now?

7
00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.633
The game has been over for a long time and there is no one here

8
00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.366
But why did I hear that melody?

9
00:00:29.666 --> 00:00:32.100
Maybe mom

10
00:00:32.266 --> 00:00:34.066
I think this has been over for a long time

11
00:00:34.133 --> 00:00:35.633
Could it be that you heard it wrong?

12
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.066
Maybe I miss life too much

13
00:00:41.066 --> 00:00:42.700
Caused hallucinations

14
00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:45.466
Mom, don't think too much.

15
00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:49.366
Yeah, mom.

16
00:00:50.066 --> 00:00:51.666
We will definitely find the voice
