00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:01.000
Gu Shao

2
00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.166
It has been confirmed that Tian Weiwei is your biological sister.

3
00:00:07.533 --> 00:00:09.933
Ok, I'll take you there.

4
00:00:09.933 --> 00:00:11.900
Give it to me

5
00:00:13.166 --> 00:00:15.333
It turns out that you have already appeared by your brother's side

6
00:00:15.333 --> 00:00:16.200
Sorry.

7
00:00:16.966 --> 00:00:18.500
Brother, we still report

8
00:00:27.766 --> 00:00:29.266
Tian Weiwei, what are you doing?

9
00:00:29.266 --> 00:00:30.333
Look at aunt come down

10
00:00:30.333 --> 00:00:31.766
Is he kidding?

11
00:00:31.766 --> 00:00:34.566
I can't believe someone like him can really dance

12
00:00:34.566 --> 00:00:35.433
you

13
00:00:35.966 --> 00:00:37.200
Never killed anyone

14
00:00:37.666 --> 00:00:38.800
What nonsense are you talking about?

15
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.566
Of course we didn't kill anyone

16
00:00:44.266 --> 00:00:45.566
Start today.

17
00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:48.100
All of you are murderers

18
00:00:48.266 --> 00:00:49.766
You'll never admit it

19
00:00:49.766 --> 00:00:52.033
How vicious is what you have done?

20
00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.400
You just say

21
00:00:54.133 --> 00:00:55.366
Why don't I remember

22
00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.100
You are me pulling his hair

23
00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.266
Why don't I remember

24
00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.100
I'm going to lock him in the bathroom

25
00:01:00.533 --> 00:01:01.666
I don't remember.

26
00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:04.433
He would stand by and watch him being bullied

27
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.233
And you've done so much to me

28
00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:09.866
But you will only say

29
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.033
I didn't push him down the stairs.

30
00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.566
I didn't throw cold water on him.

31
00:01:14.666 --> 00:01:16.800
Because I slashed his hand with a knife.

32
00:01:17.333 --> 00:01:19.300
No snake is his only problem

33
00:01:19.466 --> 00:01:21.166
I'm just kidding.

34
00:01:21.466 --> 00:01:24.866
Then pretend nothing happened

35
00:01:24.866 --> 00:01:27.666
Tian Weiwei, don't think you can use this method

36
00:01:27.666 --> 00:01:28.966
Don't get kicked out

37
00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:30.600
And you.

38
00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.066
It's because of you that I made up my mind to study

39
00:01:33.066 --> 00:01:36.866
After 13 years of giving birth, I regarded you as my idol

40
00:01:36.866 --> 00:01:38.433
13 years

41
00:01:38.533 --> 00:01:40.166
But I didn't expect it.

42
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.833
In the end, it was you

43
00:01:43.966 --> 00:01:45.800
I will not let down my own people in this life

44
00:01:46.666 --> 00:01:48.100
It's so unfair

45
00:01:49.266 --> 00:01:52.166
Why? Why am I trying so hard?

46
00:01:52.166 --> 00:01:54.233
But you ruined everything

47
00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:55.700
And you

48
00:01:56.733 --> 00:01:59.500
But you can live your life comfortably

49
00:01:59.666 --> 00:02:02.266
Pretend you haven't done anything wrong.

50
00:02:02.933 --> 00:02:04.466
Just really

51
00:02:05.066 --> 00:02:06.400
That's terrible.

52
00:02:06.466 --> 00:02:07.533
Why don't you come over?

53
00:02:07.533 --> 00:02:10.866
It's none of our business if he jumps

54
00:02:10.866 --> 00:02:12.700
What do you think?

55
00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.000
Isn't it a murderer if it's not that ugly?

56
00:02:16.166 --> 00:02:19.466
If you've done anything to me, I can't forget it.

57
00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.466
Never run for your life
