00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:02.066
I've seen a lot of girls like you

2
00:00:02.066 --> 00:00:04.400
You bumped into me at the school gate just now, didn't you?

3
00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:08.633
Tian Weiwei, I have read your information.

4
00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:11.266
I know you are a poor special enrollment student

5
00:00:11.266 --> 00:00:13.766
But that's not a reason for your poor character

6
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:16.366
Yeah, Mom.

7
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.133
I said, how does he get to my exclusive music classroom?

8
00:00:20.133 --> 00:00:21.533
It turned out that he was trying to seduce my brother

9
00:00:21.533 --> 00:00:23.033
Hey, don't talk nonsense.

10
00:00:25.066 --> 00:00:26.500
He's not who I thought he was

11
00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.866
I'll tell you the sky

12
00:00:29.866 --> 00:00:31.166
A girl like you

13
00:00:31.166 --> 00:00:32.900
You can never enter the door of our Gu family

14
00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:34.600
Just break this idea, right?

15
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.766
Put his international director in each design

16
00:00:41.366 --> 00:00:43.600
To actually hand over such educated capital

17
00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.233
They keep holding it.

18
00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:49.300
Mom, look what he said about our mom

19
00:00:49.466 --> 00:00:51.066
Your school has this kind of fairness

20
00:00:51.266 --> 00:00:52.766
What will you be bullied by every day in the future?

21
00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.433
Why don't you just fire it?

22
00:00:55.666 --> 00:00:58.366
The principal withdraws Tian Wei from school

23
00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:59.466
Such a student

24
00:00:59.466 --> 00:01:01.166
I don't deserve to be at Qingya Conservatory of Music

25
00:01:01.166 --> 00:01:02.966
I don't deserve to be a singer

26
00:01:07.333 --> 00:01:08.600
Fortunately, I have my mother and brother to protect me.

27
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.800
My brother will always protect you.

28
00:01:16.166 --> 00:01:18.566
Why is this music so familiar?
