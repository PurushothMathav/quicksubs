00:00:00.533 --> 00:00:02.833
Mom, what are you talking about?

2
00:00:03.866 --> 00:00:07.000
Wei Wei, you were born to be the life of the bottom

3
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:07.966
What else are you going to school for?

4
00:00:07.966 --> 00:00:10.233
Come home with me, mom

5
00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:12.666
I grew up dreaming

6
00:00:12.666 --> 00:00:13.766
Just him, a singer.

7
00:00:13.766 --> 00:00:15.500
You know that in order to fulfill this dream

8
00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:16.800
How many days and nights have you worked hard

9
00:00:17.333 --> 00:00:19.500
Why do you say the same thing as them?

10
00:00:19.933 --> 00:00:21.400
Am I really your daughter?

11
00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.000
It's mom, it's not for you, okay?

12
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.466
You said our house is a pancake stand

13
00:00:26.466 --> 00:00:28.466
What other singer would you like to be?

14
00:00:28.466 --> 00:00:29.633
This art

15
00:00:29.666 --> 00:00:32.366
Is it something a family like ours can afford to learn?

16
00:00:32.533 --> 00:00:35.866
Is it you who is quite self-aware?

17
00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:37.433
A little girl with pancakes

18
00:00:37.666 --> 00:00:38.766
What art are you doing?

19
00:00:39.266 --> 00:00:40.866
Where did you get the money for art?

20
00:00:41.733 --> 00:00:42.700
Take it away

21
00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:43.800
Hey, okay, okay.

22
00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.300
I'm taking him home now.

23
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.033
No, I'm not leaving.

24
00:00:47.333 --> 00:00:48.566
I want to stay.

25
00:00:48.733 --> 00:00:49.966
