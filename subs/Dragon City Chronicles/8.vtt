00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.700
Master Shen, I'll give you something when you come back.

2
00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:03.533
Help me find out

3
00:00:03.533 --> 00:00:05.700
Who was leaving a message for me last night saying this?

4
00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.966
Head Wei, Shen Crow

5
00:00:09.966 --> 00:00:12.533
Or did you catch it yourself?

6
00:00:12.533 --> 00:00:14.366
How did you become Lord Shen?

7
00:00:14.366 --> 00:00:15.866
You are questioning me

8
00:00:16.366 --> 00:00:17.600
Hey, don't dare, don't dare

9
00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:21.566
Someone came and interrogated everyone present separately

10
00:00:28.066 --> 00:00:30.066
Lord Shen has already checked it out

11
00:00:30.066 --> 00:00:31.400
After Mr. Shen entered the customs

12
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.733
Each trial has five or six people in hand

13
00:00:33.733 --> 00:00:35.433
With my many years of experience

14
00:00:35.933 --> 00:00:37.100
They didn't wake up

15
00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.866
Crow

16
00:00:37.866 --> 00:00:40.466
From yesterday to now, I have basically been in the hall

17
00:00:40.466 --> 00:00:42.866
No one was found to have touched grandpa's coffin

18
00:00:42.866 --> 00:00:43.966
Oh, I see.

19
00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:45.100
Snow Fox

20
00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:46.300
Send it to you.

21
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.866
Inspector Wei, Grandpa Zheng Long's enemies are deeply hidden

22
00:00:51.866 --> 00:00:54.300
Don't reveal his identity for the time being

23
00:00:55.866 --> 00:00:59.466
Wuhan to find out this life is boundless

24
00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.466
What identity is it?
