00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.190
What is this word?

2
00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:09.300
This kind of kid we learn to use apology.

3
00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:16.430
Sorry, I'm so guilty

4
00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.880
Take one step further

5
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.940
Your woman will not be protected.

6
00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:27.700
If you let go, there will be a dog's life and meat.

7
00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:30.140
Why should I order you now?

8
00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:31.160
Traffic conditions

9
00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:32.280
otherwise

10
00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:36.430
I'll let him out of here for a while. You dare me. I dare you.

11
00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.900
do what i say

12
00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:46.430
Traffic conditions are mysterious

13
00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:47.070
The mystery is here

14
00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:52.250
Do you and the others think I'm involved in this? I'll go over there

15
00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:55.440
You mistakenly believe that public security is a high wall of strength. I will pass through it.

16
00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.080
Although he was not allowed to die,

17
00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:58.620
What do you want

18
00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:04.879
Then how to lean on yourself?

19
00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:07.880
Expensive hands offer tenderness
