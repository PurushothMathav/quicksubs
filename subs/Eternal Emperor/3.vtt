00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:05.630
Mom, I'm back,

2
00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:07.820
You sleep, are you still sleeping?

3
00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:10.520
I can't figure it out. You finally came back to see it.

4
00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:12.800
Come out and eat.

5
00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:16.660
I'll go find him first, here I am,

6
00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.150
I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming,

7
00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:21.050
I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming,

8
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.360
I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming,

9
00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:25.120
I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming, you're coming, you're coming

10
00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:26.840
Come, you come, you come, you come, you come, you come, you come,

11
00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:31.940
you are here,

12
00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:47.880
You are here, you are here,

13
00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:49.720
not you

14
00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:51.920
Look who this is

15
00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:53.180
I'll give you food

16
00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:55.650
It’s been a long time since I’ve been right

17
00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:57.740
By the way

18
00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:02.490
Wife, you did a great job photographing me. I like it very much.

19
00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:03.560
You two don't owe food

20
00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:04.360
Why is it you

21
00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:06.810
why are you here

22
00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:08.590
Come here, I'll come here, there's more

23
00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:11.550
To my evil fiancé, please give me a minute

24
00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:14.700
You said this emphasizes that it tells you

25
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:15.500
Not evil fiancé

26
00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:16.120
You don't have an evil marriage

27
00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:17.220
Quite a bit

28
00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.260
This is my last home

29
00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:19.520
I was sent to have sex with someone else

30
00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:20.720
My wife told me to be busy

31
00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.010
Busy with young me

32
00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:23.620
I'll give you a meal

33
00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:24.700
One hundred times stronger

34
00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:26.560
forgot to tell you

35
00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.760
We got off the car and called Marriage Child Qianqian

36
00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:33.380
I did it to protect you back then

37
00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:34.540
I just recorded the words

38
00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:35.540
Tell me before and after

39
00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.360
You want to marry this rape agent

40
00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:38.200
Is it windy?

41
00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.150
Look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look

42
00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:42.710
Look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look

43
00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:50.130
Look at it, look at it, look at it, look at it, look at it, look at it, look at it, look at it, look at it Look at it, look at it, look at it, look at it, look at it, look at it, look at it, look at it, look at it Look at it, look at it, look at it, look at it, look at it, look at it, look at it, look at it, look at it Look, look, look, look

44
00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:07.030
Look, look, look
