00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:09.500
This meal is very expensive and painful.

2
00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:12.100
I really can't. I didn't expect you to be injured like this.

3
00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:16.810
You're still old enough. The police officer asked him to have his old nose pierced.

4
00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:18.650
Please let me go and call you now.

5
00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.250
Don't let it go

6
00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:21.660
you let me let me

7
00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.240
My whole life was ruined

8
00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:24.460
But since my meeting

9
00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:26.540
You've spoken out. Now get up on your knees.

10
00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.210
I'll give you a hundred young men to fight for a month. It's better to let Mr. Wang go.

11
00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:34.940
Allows you to store it for several months

12
00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:37.680
But there are many

13
00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.400
I even knelt down

14
00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:41.310
It's them who should kneel

15
00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:45.120
You stole my dad, let me see

16
00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:47.020
You have to let a few people die to save me.

17
00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:49.410
Not afraid of death

18
00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.000
Now itâ€™s even said here

19
00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:55.190
Let me see how you clean up what he has done to you.
