00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:06.240
Come on, can you give me a one-price lift?

2
00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:09.250
Give him the price! Give him the price!

3
00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.370
Don't worry, give me the price and I will let you own the whole world.

4
00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:37.640
I don’t want my whole world to be you.

5
00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:48.140
What program?

6
00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.320
This is just an expense that I have abandoned.

7
00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:57.410
I finally went to the meeting and gave him a price, and I was really good at it.

8
00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:02.030
What should I do? The price will go down, so remember it from the market.

9
00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:11.800
Let’s go home first, shall we?

10
00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:14.040
Go home? Do you want the original price back?

11
00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:15.410
They all have such bad intentions.

12
00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.780
But they should already know they are wrong.

13
00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.410
I believe they won’t do bad things again in the future.

14
00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:26.710
Where are all your things?

15
00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.120
Wait until we get married

16
00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:29.740
I also need to find a place where I can get better and move in.

17
00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:32.130
How to go home
