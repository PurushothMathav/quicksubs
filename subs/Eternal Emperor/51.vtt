00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.280
We eat at home.

2
00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:04.520
This is not our place to eat.

3
00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:06.720
This is not our place to eat, our place is not the place to eat, our place is not the place to eat, our place is not the place to eat, our place is not the place to eat

4
00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.220
Eat at home, don’t eat at home, don’t eat at home,

5
00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.240
We don’t have food at home, we don’t have food at home,

6
00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:13.030
We don’t have food at home, we don’t have food at home,

7
00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:15.720
We don’t have dinner at home,

8
00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:17.900
We don’t have food at home, we don’t have food at home,

9
00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:20.120
Not our place to eat, not our place to eat, not our place to eat, not our place to eat, not our place to eat, not our place to eat, not our place

10
00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:24.560
Eating, not us, eating at home, not us

11
00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:28.900
So reminiscing. Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.

12
00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:31.140
Come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come

13
00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.640
Come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come

14
00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.190
Come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on

15
00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:59.040
Come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come Come on, come on, come on

16
00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.530
We don’t want to buy anything in this house.

17
00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.780
This house looks like this kind of thing today

18
00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:06.880
Dog's eyes look at people

19
00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:08.470
Let us be so ruined

20
00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.950
Forget it, he bought hair

21
00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:13.340
This kind of fear

22
00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:16.240
Are you even qualified to enter?

23
00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:18.620
What are you talking about with stinky hands?

24
00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:21.060
You can go in if you want

25
00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.740
The person you call me now is super nice

26
00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:25.640
Barking like a dog

27
00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:28.570
While climbing the Ershi River, I

28
00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:35.010
The strongest one enters the Communist Party and surrenders to Daxing

29
00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.990
What's there

30
00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:37.700
Tell you to crawl and listen to the space
