00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:02.440
Dad, why are you hitting me?

2
00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:04.970
It's all this kid. They are all Fu'er.

3
00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:08.410
Hou Fu punished this person

4
00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:10.870
Is it expensive to stay outside every day for Hou Fu?

5
00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:14.930
I don't know Shang Fei, it's all him

6
00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.040
It was he who changed our family's publicity

7
00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:18.640
Even pretending to be

8
00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:20.460
I don't have to charge the door anymore.

9
00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:21.740
You raised your face and wiped out your hands

10
00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:23.030
He must also be convicted

11
00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:26.150
I prove that he said he was offended

12
00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:28.350
I'm very curious.

13
00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:30.030
Do you have the courage?

14
00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:31.150
condemned me

15
00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.940
You still have such courage dad?

16
00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:34.840
You are a toy

17
00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:37.880
Protector, you still dare to claim the throne, right?

18
00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.760
I tell you

19
00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.220
Don’t talk about it alive today

20
00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:41.380
You punish me here

21
00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:43.220
Which sin did you suffer from?

22
00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:46.760
Who would you write this letter to?

23
00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.860
Is there some misunderstanding here?

24
00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:50.180
Misunderstanding is a common problem in our family

25
00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:51.570
The boss of the meal sent

26
00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.010
You hide the same thing and don’t look at it

27
00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:55.310
You are the same no matter what

28
00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:56.470
You don't have to change your mind

29
00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:58.430
You don’t have to talk, right?

30
00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:01.070
It’s just that we have a super big one at home.

31
00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:05.850
Color along the way

32
00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:08.790
It's the two of you who are brave

33
00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.990
I don't have any identity to speak here.

34
00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:12.950
you know

35
00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:14.610
What is his identity?
