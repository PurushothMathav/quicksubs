00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:04.340
Try it, what about the seniors who bully our engineering students?

2
00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:08.910
certainly. Why are you here?

3
00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:10.530
What happened?

4
00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.430
Come, let me help you make some comments.

5
00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:16.540
At that time, this person was talking to me,

6
00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:20.460
They want their apology to not be reassuring at all.

7
00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:23.220
I can try to make a comment.

8
00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.300
Which student worker are you?

9
00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.040
Huh? Learn how to take a thorough shot.

10
00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:29.920
I must kick you out of school,

11
00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.280
You have been judged wrong.

12
00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:35.890
I feel like listening to the wind is just one shot.

13
00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.110
I didn't shoot him through.

14
00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:41.410
No matter who takes the road to Tiankou.

15
00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:43.990
All this proves that he is loveless

16
00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:45.600
And my bet with him

17
00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.280
Everyone present heard it

18
00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:51.850
Now is the time for him to show his kindness to Wa Zhao

19
00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:55.300
The bet in this video is to be strong

20
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.780
Indeed, the adjusted result is better than

21
00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.320
No one has time to be strong

22
00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.780
Maybe I'm remembering it wrong

23
00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:02.900
Answer him innocently

24
00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:05.970
Don't bet on others like this.

25
00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:08.200
It’s so bad to meet a man

26
00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:09.720
So much betting on others

27
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.340
How could there be so much gambling?

28
00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.360
Next, is it about betting on others?

29
00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:17.670
Now the evidence is already yours

30
00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:20.510
I should chase you like I apologized

31
00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:22.780
You are dishonest

32
00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:24.350
Ling Bingli

33
00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.970
your students

34
00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:29.600
Wu Mie is a good guy, it’s okay, I’ll pick me up

35
00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:30.580
What do you think we should do?

36
00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:39.660
Wearing it straight is the original Taiko

37
00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:42.690
This time it has a very serious meaning

38
00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.860
Don't worry about yourself after suffering such a serious injury
