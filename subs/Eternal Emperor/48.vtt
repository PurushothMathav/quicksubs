00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:08.220
I'll try it myself. What do you think?

2
00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.280
You still don’t like eating?

3
00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:10.900
Eat and wander the swamp

4
00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:13.480
I have eaten and it looks so good on your face

5
00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:14.890
Not so borderline

6
00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:16.230
I can't forget it long ago

7
00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:17.830
The middle of the month for his sister-in-law

8
00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:19.270
It was meant to be sold

9
00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:20.730
Don’t pigs understand?

10
00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:21.590
I have to sell it anyway

11
00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:23.470
It's enough if you don't die

12
00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:28.940
Come and thank us for choosing the jade-growing mushroom? Just don’t say it

13
00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:31.180
If you take it for sale, you won't be able to sell it off.

14
00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:35.600
Are you sure you want to take someone like this away?

15
00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:38.100
How should I go

16
00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.430
The eighth person beats your relative while driving

17
00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:42.270
How did you hit me?

18
00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.150
The eighth person beats your relative while driving

19
00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:45.650
The eighth person beats your relative while driving

20
00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.750
The eighth person beats your relative while driving

21
00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:46.910
The eighth person beats you not only easily but also

22
00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:48.430
Brother stuff

23
00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:50.720
Let's make a fool of ourselves on the edge of my land

24
00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:53.620
I like to let you push him out without any necessary force

25
00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:57.940
I tell you

26
00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.450
I want Juncheng to buy tens of millions of dollars to make something good.
