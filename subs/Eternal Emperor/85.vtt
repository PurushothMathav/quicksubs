00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.250
In today's first hour, it is not considered a big land.

2
00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:11.850
Do you want to be this person for the rest of your life?

3
00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:12.770
Something that qualifies today

4
00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:15.450
Just a casual compliment

5
00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.480
Let's live this life

6
00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:18.380
Oh, here goes

7
00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:20.490
Centimeter Nadian, I have no control over who I choose.

8
00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.960
I can do it here. Where's the signal?

9
00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:24.980
Put it in and then go in and sit down.

10
00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.880
I haven't even sat on these two conditions. Mom is here.

11
00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:28.380
Really upscale place

12
00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:30.650
Who brought in the stuff casually?

13
00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.310
you all hope you

14
00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:34.750
Yes, not today either

15
00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:36.900
How much more?

16
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.680
I haven't found you three yet and can't send them off.

17
00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:43.610
Do you still dare to ask questions in front of us?

18
00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.940
If my things belong to us, we are no longer us, right?

19
00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:50.430
We are more affectionate

20
00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:51.810
Also outside China

21
00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:52.670
You pay me a fee

22
00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:54.110
Nothing to do with love

23
00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:55.090
Very exciting too

24
00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:56.390
I really don't have much

25
00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:57.760
Did you hear it?

26
00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:59.440
Quickly feel alone

27
00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:00.200
He has no feelings

28
00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:01.180
Don't dare to meet

29
00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:02.840
I just don't have any feelings

30
00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:07.480
This place will die, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, one will die

31
00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:09.160
You, your mouth, your mouth

32
00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:10.700
Really buy here

33
00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.120
Treat it as gone

34
00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.480
This place is like the largest force

35
00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:16.550
Big fan

36
00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:18.530
Even if itâ€™s a high price to buy

37
00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:19.290
come here

38
00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.070
You can't die, either.

39
00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:34.590
Please protect yourself

40
00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:35.630
How dare you wear so many clothes?

41
00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:36.790
Each protective step

42
00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.260
He fights to the death

43
00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:50.290
Don't you think there's going to be a fight?

44
00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:51.660
Still behind
