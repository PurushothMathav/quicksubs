00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:05.480
That's right. A fool can act like a fool. It's really hard to install a home card.

2
00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:08.080
I'm so happy. You've been able to withdraw money with this card.

3
00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.380
I helped. I picked it up and used it as a ball for you.

4
00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.000
You pretended to be me, but you can't get the money out. Let me see how you can pay it back.

5
00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.840
Okay, it’s not serious to eat me.

6
00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:23.990
Just let the money in the card buy ten properties, and there are more than enough mistakes.

7
00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:25.610
Too much too much

8
00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:27.610
You deserve a share of it for Niu Hide to brag about.

9
00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:28.450
Spend money continuously

10
00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:30.170
I have to deliberately think about the person I want.

11
00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:33.210
It’s shameful to respect Mr. Ka

12
00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.470
true or false

13
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.080
You'll know after just one swipe

14
00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.010
Stab to death, stab to death

15
00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.910
If you can't make money, never

16
00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:45.410
I'll beat you to death

17
00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:51.150
It’s indeed a fake card

18
00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:53.030
Which fake card deceived me?

19
00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:55.770
Original place card

20
00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.230
Even if you can’t afford a house

21
00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:58.710
It's embarrassing to still be here

22
00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:00.710
It's really funny

23
00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.280
This is the gold card

24
00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.940
I think you are just a nanny, okay? Your mother?

25
00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:06.900
let's go

26
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:10.360
Hope there can be

27
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.940
You only have a low-level death machine

28
00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.470
It's normal for the paint to be broken

29
00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:17.850
Saw my dad

30
00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.610
That's too red and white, right?

31
00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.190
Take him for example

32
00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:25.670
Add a card by yourself

33
00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:27.070
We don’t know each other yet

34
00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:33.110
