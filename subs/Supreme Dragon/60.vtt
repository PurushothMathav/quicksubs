00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:01.200
You stink

2
00:00:01.466 --> 00:00:03.100
You have no right to speak here

3
00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:05.900
I beg you to figure it out before you curse

4
00:00:06.266 --> 00:00:08.100
Your contract does not have our late autumn.

5
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:09.666
You can't sign at all

6
00:00:11.066 --> 00:00:12.766
Stir this up

7
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.833
Believe it or not, the old man kicked you out of the company too

8
00:00:15.133 --> 00:00:16.466
Disappear what the hell do you want to do

9
00:00:16.466 --> 00:00:17.900
I said it all

10
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.700
You really have a begging attitude

11
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.566
Su Wanqiao, I beg you, okay?

12
00:00:27.333 --> 00:00:29.433
Oh, no sincerity, but no coincidence.

13
00:00:29.566 --> 00:00:32.466
What are you doing, Su Wanqiao, you can't do this to me

14
00:00:32.466 --> 00:00:33.966
I bow to you

15
00:00:34.333 --> 00:00:35.933
Just promise me

16
00:00:35.933 --> 00:00:37.100
You figure it out

17
00:00:37.366 --> 00:00:39.300
It's your business to ask or not

18
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.966
It's our business to answer or not

19
00:00:41.966 --> 00:00:43.666
Hey, I said it here.

20
00:00:43.933 --> 00:00:45.366
Late autumn has been decided

21
00:00:45.366 --> 00:00:46.300
No more backing down

22
00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:47.400
It's time.

23
00:00:47.533 --> 00:00:48.333
Xiao Chen

24
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.433
How dare you play with me

25
00:00:50.866 --> 00:00:52.366
Oops, is it fun?

26
00:00:52.366 --> 00:00:53.500
Oh, that's it.

27
00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:54.566
Hey go home go home go home

28
00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.333
What the hell is going on with the clown?

29
00:00:59.333 --> 00:01:02.200
The chairperson of Sun Shun Group knew that his son had made a mistake

30
00:01:02.266 --> 00:01:04.066
I won't compensate you for this, right?

31
00:01:04.466 --> 00:01:05.966
Someone as big as him

32
00:01:05.966 --> 00:01:07.866
There's no need to compensate me, is there?

33
00:01:07.866 --> 00:01:09.666
Hey, these big shots?

34
00:01:09.666 --> 00:01:12.300
The most important thing is that he doesn't have his own hands

35
00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:14.233
Look at his son. He's such a jerk.

36
00:01:14.466 --> 00:01:15.166
Countdown sooner or later

37
00:01:15.166 --> 00:01:18.400
Master, when you get it, the Sun Group is finished.

38
00:01:18.866 --> 00:01:21.566
That's true, isn't it?

39
00:01:23.066 --> 00:01:24.266
Hey, why are you going?

40
00:01:24.266 --> 00:01:25.266
What else?

41
00:01:25.266 --> 00:01:26.600
Of course, hurry back to the company

42
00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.766
Sign the contract with the Heart Group

43
00:01:28.766 --> 00:01:29.666
What!

44
00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.400
Muse is going to sign a contract with them
