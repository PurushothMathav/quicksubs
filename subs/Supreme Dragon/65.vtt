00:00:00.766 --> 00:00:03.233
Oh what a joke

2
00:00:03.466 --> 00:00:04.800
You people

3
00:00:05.266 --> 00:00:07.466
Stinky beggar, what are you laughing at?

4
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:08.933
How can you speak here?

5
00:00:08.933 --> 00:00:10.566
I laugh at you for being greedy.

6
00:00:10.666 --> 00:00:12.000
Laugh at your selfishness

7
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.066
Laugh at you people who bully the soft and fear the hard

8
00:00:15.066 --> 00:00:17.566
Look at your mouths.

9
00:00:17.766 --> 00:00:19.600
ugly and vulgar

10
00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:21.466
obscene

11
00:00:22.133 --> 00:00:23.066
talk a lot

12
00:00:24.333 --> 00:00:25.800
Dare to scold me again

13
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:27.600
Slap you with a big mouth

14
00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:30.500
Please take a good look at what is written in the contract

15
00:00:30.933 --> 00:00:32.566
The terms clearly indicate

16
00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:35.700
If Su Wanqiu hadn't made a big mistake

17
00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.766
This contract from start to finish

18
00:00:37.766 --> 00:00:39.433
The person in charge is our late autumn

19
00:00:39.966 --> 00:00:41.866
If the change is responsible

20
00:00:41.933 --> 00:00:43.700
The contract is wasted immediately

21
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.066
Su Wanjiao, you bitch

22
00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:49.700
You actually played tricks with me

23
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.100
You are not kind

24
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.200
You can't worship me as you wish

25
00:01:01.533 --> 00:01:03.366
I'm pissed off I'm pissed off

26
00:01:03.566 --> 00:01:05.033
Count this bitch

27
00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.366
Or pretend to be silly and sweet

28
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.266
I'm really pissed off.

29
00:01:09.333 --> 00:01:11.766
This project must not be given to him to choose

30
00:01:12.266 --> 00:01:14.166
I had a hard time stepping on him

31
00:01:14.166 --> 00:01:15.633
How could it be possible to let him line up?

32
00:01:15.766 --> 00:01:17.100
But I'll keep an eye on it.

33
00:01:18.066 --> 00:01:18.866
What return?

34
00:01:18.933 --> 00:01:20.800
Come on, it says on the contract

35
00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.366
When there was no problem with Su Wanqiu

36
00:01:23.566 --> 00:01:24.833
He is a responsible

37
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.833
So if he makes a mistake
