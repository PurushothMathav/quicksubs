00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.900
You said that Su Wanqiu is the minister and he is the minister

2
00:00:03.266 --> 00:00:05.300
You stinky beggar trash pursuit

3
00:00:05.566 --> 00:00:07.233
What qualifications do you have to be with me and Tianao?

4
00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:10.166
If you don't achieve enough and lose more

5
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.300
He really can't beat you

6
00:00:13.166 --> 00:00:16.000
Grandpa, what you said before still doesn't count

7
00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:17.900
Our late autumn

8
00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:19.200
As long as you help Su Zhi Group get it

9
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.533
Eligibility for staying in Wancheng

10
00:00:20.533 --> 00:00:21.400
Just let him do it.

11
00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.100
You don't want me to say if your brain is squeezed by the door

12
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.400
I deliberately used this to make fun of it.

13
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.200
Grandpa said sarcasm

14
00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:30.566
Why do you say so?

15
00:00:30.566 --> 00:00:31.966
You know what to ask

16
00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:34.400
People like you who sprinkle salt in the mall overnight

17
00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:35.600
It's worse than pigs and dogs

18
00:00:36.666 --> 00:00:37.833
And your paternity

19
00:00:37.966 --> 00:00:40.800
Take your beggar husband back quickly

20
00:00:40.866 --> 00:00:42.133
Don't come out disgusting

21
00:00:42.133 --> 00:00:44.466
You're disgusting. What do you mean?

22
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.466
Grandpa, I must be here to cause you trouble this time.

23
00:00:48.533 --> 00:00:51.266
Instead, I'm here to bring you the good news.

24
00:00:52.066 --> 00:00:53.066
What good news?

25
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.700
Wanchen's settlement plan has been completed.

26
00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.766
How is this possible? It's up to you.

27
00:01:03.766 --> 00:01:06.166
Keep your eyes peeled.

28
00:01:06.466 --> 00:01:08.966
This is the agreement for Quality Group to settle in Wancheng

29
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.200
We're done betting
