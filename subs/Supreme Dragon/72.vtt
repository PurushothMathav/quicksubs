00:00:02.266 --> 00:00:02.500
Really?

2
00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:04.966
The lady specially mentioned this place for me today

3
00:00:04.966 --> 00:00:05.733
What's the matter?

4
00:00:05.733 --> 00:00:07.833
Sun's Group will immediately enter a batch of departments

5
00:00:07.933 --> 00:00:10.100
You are the person responsible for harvest inspection.

6
00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:13.666
I hope Uncle Li can put some water by then.

7
00:00:13.666 --> 00:00:14.866
Absolutely not.

8
00:00:14.866 --> 00:00:16.200
Miss Wanqiu said

9
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.466
This project is very important

10
00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:20.066
Never give a fork

11
00:00:20.066 --> 00:00:21.433
Su Wan begged her to count as a fart

12
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.266
Uncle Li, as long as you want

13
00:00:25.266 --> 00:00:27.633
The benefits are naturally indispensable to you

14
00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:30.200
Is that right miss

15
00:00:30.266 --> 00:00:32.366
I know you have a conflict with Late Autumn

16
00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:33.500
But

17
00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.300
I advise you not to have any bad thoughts about this project

18
00:00:36.333 --> 00:00:38.666
Otherwise, you can't afford this home

19
00:00:38.766 --> 00:00:40.866
I know what happened today didn't happen.

20
00:00:40.866 --> 00:00:42.966
I don't want to look at you anymore

21
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.166
Otherwise

22
00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.333
I'm going to the chairperson to expose you

23
00:00:46.333 --> 00:00:47.700
Hahahaha

24
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.366
You want to expose me

25
00:00:49.933 --> 00:00:51.500
If you do

26
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.533
I will definitely pull you on your back

27
00:00:53.533 --> 00:00:54.866
What does that have to do with me?

28
00:00:54.866 --> 00:00:56.800
What you have been doing at the company over the years

29
00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.466
You think I don't know?

30
00:00:58.566 --> 00:01:00.166
If this lady is not at the bottom

31
00:01:00.566 --> 00:01:01.766
Will come to you for help

32
00:01:01.766 --> 00:01:03.033
You you

33
00:01:03.166 --> 00:01:04.866
What do you know?

34
00:01:04.866 --> 00:01:06.633
You're a 50-year-old man.

35
00:01:06.666 --> 00:01:08.266
There are old and young

36
00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.033
If I make you good at your job

37
00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.366
Talk about taking bribes

38
00:01:13.466 --> 00:01:16.600
How many years do you think you can eat and grow old?

39
00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.233
What to say don't go too far

40
00:01:19.333 --> 00:01:20.800
I'm pushing you

41
00:01:20.966 --> 00:01:23.433
Do it or not, you choose
