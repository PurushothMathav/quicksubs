00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.433
You are Li Xiangqin

2
00:00:01.733 --> 00:00:03.900
That's right, that's fine.

3
00:00:04.533 --> 00:00:05.466
Come on out.

4
00:00:07.766 --> 00:00:08.866
Not a single one

5
00:00:10.366 --> 00:00:11.866
Do you know why I came to you?

6
00:00:12.933 --> 00:00:14.500
It's for this little bastard

7
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.600
He's not a bastard

8
00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:17.800
His name is Su Xiaocao

9
00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:18.866
She's my daughter.

10
00:00:18.866 --> 00:00:22.000
Hahaha, I thought it was a big shot.

11
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.666
It turns out that the old wild species is back

12
00:00:24.866 --> 00:00:26.466
So what if you came back?

13
00:00:27.066 --> 00:00:28.933
I can open your daughter's cornea

14
00:00:28.933 --> 00:00:30.300
You look up to him.

15
00:00:30.333 --> 00:00:32.233
He shouldn't be happy.

16
00:00:32.266 --> 00:00:33.166
unhappy

17
00:00:33.733 --> 00:00:35.633
You are a nightclub owner

18
00:00:35.766 --> 00:00:38.833
Take the enemy's cornea as a charity

19
00:00:39.466 --> 00:00:40.200
Do you know

20
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.900
My daughter can't see light without a cornea.

21
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:43.900
You lowly bastard

22
00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:45.466
Can you torture the bastard for me?

23
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.233
It's not like I can't afford it.

24
00:00:48.333 --> 00:00:49.966
Come on, he has to get married.

25
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.366
100,000 200,000

26
00:00:52.733 --> 00:00:54.866
As long as I can use your daughter's cornea

27
00:00:54.866 --> 00:00:57.566
See more beautiful and high-end scenery

28
00:00:57.733 --> 00:01:00.600
Your whole family should be grateful for me

29
00:01:00.666 --> 00:01:02.933
Woman, don't talk nonsense with him

30
00:01:02.933 --> 00:01:04.366
See how I kill him

31
00:01:10.866 --> 00:01:12.400
You kill you

32
00:01:13.866 --> 00:01:17.566
Sister is too powerful to beat

33
00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:23.500
elder brother

34
00:01:24.333 --> 00:01:26.433
Didn't something misunderstand?
