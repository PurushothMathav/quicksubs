00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.766
Xiao Chen, you can't make jokes like this.

2
00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:06.100
Then if you are not a god

3
00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:07.200
You put the ball with me

4
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.800
What happened to the wedding of the century yesterday?

5
00:00:10.733 --> 00:00:13.000
And the Heavenly Zhixin he brought yesterday

6
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.166
What's going on?

7
00:00:14.366 --> 00:00:17.566
Uncle, the necklace I wore that day was fake.

8
00:00:17.566 --> 00:00:18.866
Not worth much.

9
00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:22.633
As for this wedding, as far as I'm concerned

10
00:00:23.466 --> 00:00:24.700
Six years ago?

11
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.166
I didn't record being a beggar when I celebrated

12
00:00:28.266 --> 00:00:30.100
I happened to be in a Panlong car accident

13
00:00:30.566 --> 00:00:31.900
I saved his life

14
00:00:32.166 --> 00:00:33.866
He promised me then

15
00:00:33.866 --> 00:00:35.900
Will grant me a wish

16
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.900
Your wish is to hold a wedding

17
00:00:39.266 --> 00:00:40.066
Exactly.

18
00:00:40.566 --> 00:00:43.133
As for the behind-the-scenes boss you mentioned

19
00:00:43.133 --> 00:00:44.800
I heard that after the investment promotion meeting

20
00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.366
People have left myopia

21
00:00:48.166 --> 00:00:49.233
Not that

22
00:00:49.966 --> 00:00:51.066
All of this.

23
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.200
It's all news hype

24
00:00:53.466 --> 00:00:54.500
Then what?

25
00:00:55.966 --> 00:00:56.766
I thought

26
00:00:57.733 --> 00:00:59.766
The Su family has climbed to Shenhao

27
00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.566
Apprentice is just around the corner

28
00:01:05.766 --> 00:01:07.033
Laugh so much

29
00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.600
Well, I have something to do, I'll go first

30
00:01:12.466 --> 00:01:15.366
Mom and Dad are leaving

31
00:01:15.666 --> 00:01:16.833
Don't worry about their little sister-in-law

32
00:01:17.066 --> 00:01:17.866
I can eat.

33
00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.433
Then I want to eat a chicken leg

34
00:01:20.866 --> 00:01:22.100
Good dad will add it to you.

35
00:01:22.666 --> 00:01:24.433
Eat, eat, you know to eat

36
00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.266
Do you deserve to eat chicken thighs for a woman like you?

37
00:01:28.066 --> 00:01:30.200
Just eat dog liver water

38
00:01:30.766 --> 00:01:33.166
If my daughter pulls out your tongue
