00:00:00.566 --> 00:00:03.500
Su Wanqiang, you wolf-hearted thing

2
00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:05.300
It hurt our Su family so badly

3
00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:07.466
I can only take out loans now to solve the crisis

4
00:00:07.466 --> 00:00:09.000
What does this have to do with me?

5
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.400
It's not my fault.

6
00:00:10.466 --> 00:00:11.866
The Su family raised you so much

7
00:00:12.133 --> 00:00:13.666
It's better to have a dog

8
00:00:13.666 --> 00:00:14.866
Do you believe it or not?

9
00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:16.900
How dare you scold one more word?

10
00:00:16.933 --> 00:00:18.666
I pulled your tongue out for you

11
00:00:20.166 --> 00:00:21.600
What do you want?

12
00:00:22.166 --> 00:00:23.566
Here is the bank

13
00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:25.200
Rule of law society

14
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:26.700
It's up to you

15
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:29.466
Why is this mad dog biting people?

16
00:00:29.466 --> 00:00:30.966
I can't even taste it anymore

17
00:00:31.933 --> 00:00:33.400
Ah, that's right.

18
00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:34.666
I've seen you before.

19
00:00:34.666 --> 00:00:37.000
You are the beggar, right?

20
00:00:37.066 --> 00:00:39.200
What's the matter, who are you?

21
00:00:39.933 --> 00:00:41.200
My name is Zhang Haiyang.

22
00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:42.633
Look at this posture

23
00:00:43.166 --> 00:00:44.000
presumably

24
00:00:44.766 --> 00:00:47.366
You two are here for a loan today, right?

25
00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.033
Yeah. Why?

26
00:00:49.133 --> 00:00:50.566
Come back quickly

27
00:00:50.733 --> 00:00:51.800
You can't get a loan.

28
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.166
How do you know I can't get a loan?

29
00:00:53.166 --> 00:00:55.133
Just because I am Zhang Haiyang

30
00:00:55.133 --> 00:00:58.133
It's a high payment from the credit department of this celebration bank

31
00:00:58.133 --> 00:01:00.433
Then if I loan it out today

32
00:01:00.666 --> 00:01:01.966
And it's not a penny.

33
00:01:02.466 --> 00:01:03.400
It's one point.

34
00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.400
If you could bring me to this ocean

35
00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:08.533
Credit department executives

36
00:01:08.533 --> 00:01:10.933
Quit immediately

37
00:01:10.933 --> 00:01:12.666
If you are so confident

38
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.666
You can just pack up and get out
