00:00:01.066 --> 00:00:02.866
Is it grandpa?

2
00:00:03.266 --> 00:00:06.366
Fourth grandpa is our blood-linked family after all

3
00:00:06.366 --> 00:00:08.866
Are you going too far?

4
00:00:08.866 --> 00:00:10.100
What relative

5
00:00:10.266 --> 00:00:12.300
Since grandpa broke up with him

6
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:13.966
We are already two families

7
00:00:13.966 --> 00:00:15.833
Even two families

8
00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:18.966
After all, Fourth Grandpa is very kind to our Su Group

9
00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.066
Sun Group has so many orders.

10
00:00:21.066 --> 00:00:22.633
What's wrong with giving him points?

11
00:00:22.733 --> 00:00:23.600
This old man Su

12
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.100
Obviously, it depends on our Su Group.

13
00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:26.600
It has a great effect with the Sun Group

14
00:00:26.766 --> 00:00:29.366
Want to get a share of the shameless soup?

15
00:00:29.366 --> 00:00:32.300
It's as if you live the belly of a gentleman with the heart of a villain

16
00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:33.433
Between living villains

17
00:00:33.533 --> 00:00:35.500
I will give him this order today.

18
00:00:35.533 --> 00:00:36.566
There will be a second person tomorrow.

19
00:00:36.566 --> 00:00:38.133
A third person, maybe even millions, wants to come.

20
00:00:38.133 --> 00:00:41.200
Is this order for or not?

21
00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.433
I am Su's Gale

22
00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.066
It's not your turn to do

23
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:51.600
4 grandpa

24
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.300
I'm so sorry.

25
00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:56.766
Can't help you

26
00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.200
It's okay late autumn

27
00:00:59.733 --> 00:01:01.033
Miss pair

28
00:01:02.666 --> 00:01:03.833
The world is hot and cold

29
00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.833
Some people drink all the wine

30
00:01:12.566 --> 00:01:13.366
Late Autumn

31
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.400
You're a good boy.

32
00:01:17.466 --> 00:01:19.100
Listen to your grandfather's advice

33
00:01:19.933 --> 00:01:21.400
Go if you can

34
00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.900
Find a place that suits you

35
00:01:29.366 --> 00:01:32.633
Hey, grandpa said where did I tell you to die?

36
00:01:32.733 --> 00:01:34.300
Get back here right now
