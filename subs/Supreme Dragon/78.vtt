00:00:00.933 --> 00:00:02.000
Are you alright uncle

2
00:00:02.566 --> 00:00:03.766
Why are you here?

3
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:04.733
Xiaocao died

4
00:00:04.733 --> 00:00:06.666
Let me pick you up when you get off work.

5
00:00:07.466 --> 00:00:09.000
I didn't expect this to happen again

6
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.166
Just this stinky beggar

7
00:00:10.166 --> 00:00:11.266
You hit me again.

8
00:00:11.266 --> 00:00:14.033
We should hit you half dizzy

9
00:00:14.266 --> 00:00:15.466
I'm not making trouble

10
00:00:15.966 --> 00:00:17.500
I also have a wife, to be fair

11
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:19.466
The truth hasn't come out yet

12
00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.266
It was also maliciously danced by some people

13
00:00:22.466 --> 00:00:23.700
Wrong good people

14
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.800
This is not the fabric I ordered at all

15
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.933
This could be someone trying to frame me.

16
00:00:28.933 --> 00:00:31.200
Then tell me who framed you

17
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:32.000
Uncle Li

18
00:00:32.166 --> 00:00:34.800
You are always responsible for purchasing fabrics.

19
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.500
Can you tell me what's going on here?

20
00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:41.566
You ask me what's going on

21
00:00:41.666 --> 00:00:44.666
Chairperson, I have to report to you

22
00:00:44.933 --> 00:00:46.366
Just a few days ago

23
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.633
Miss Save asked me to accept a shipment

24
00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:50.766
It is said to be an inspection-free product.

25
00:00:51.066 --> 00:00:52.633
And shoved me 5,000 bucks

26
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.566
I just know now

27
00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.866
Are you eating a kickback?

28
00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.300
Look at you spitting blood

29
00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:01.666
Why can't you admit it?

30
00:01:02.533 --> 00:01:04.766
It's a terrible thing.

31
00:01:04.766 --> 00:01:07.633
This project owner needs to be replaced

32
00:01:07.766 --> 00:01:11.666
Hmph. Meanwhile, Sun Wanqiu can't stay in the company anymore

33
00:01:12.466 --> 00:01:15.500
Everything, Sun Wanqiu, you bear it alone
