00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:01.566
Hurry up and insult my daughter

2
00:00:01.566 --> 00:00:02.666
I pulled your tongue out

3
00:00:02.666 --> 00:00:03.866
If you have the ability, come and pull it out

4
00:00:03.866 --> 00:00:05.266
Who the hell do you think it is?

5
00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:09.366
How dare you pretend to be a god and deceive for a night

6
00:00:09.366 --> 00:00:10.666
Deceive our Su family

7
00:00:10.766 --> 00:00:13.566
Shameless and you Su Wanqiang

8
00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:16.066
I thought I was married to Shenhao

9
00:00:16.066 --> 00:00:18.933
Hahaha, what about the result?

10
00:00:18.933 --> 00:00:22.433
It's just a stinky beggar, hahaha.

11
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:25.866
How dare you hit me?

12
00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:27.900
Although I am not a god

13
00:00:28.066 --> 00:00:29.900
But what did I tell you?

14
00:00:30.966 --> 00:00:32.666
Don't irritate me

15
00:00:33.366 --> 00:00:35.066
You psychopath

16
00:00:35.266 --> 00:00:36.966
I will fight for you today.

17
00:00:36.966 --> 00:00:40.033
Enough is enough. Isn't it embarrassing enough?

18
00:00:42.766 --> 00:00:43.566
Aqiu

19
00:00:44.566 --> 00:00:46.633
Are you disappointed in me?

20
00:00:46.733 --> 00:00:47.866
How come?

21
00:00:48.066 --> 00:00:51.466
But the wedding yesterday really scared me.

22
00:00:51.866 --> 00:00:52.666
Why is that?

23
00:00:52.666 --> 00:00:56.466
In fact, I never wanted you to be a hero

24
00:00:56.733 --> 00:00:59.666
I wish our family of three were like this

25
00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.366
Happiness and happiness simply live together

26
00:01:02.366 --> 00:01:03.600
That's enough.

27
00:01:03.966 --> 00:01:06.166
So when you say

28
00:01:06.166 --> 00:01:08.566
You are that ordinary time of depression

29
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.233
I breathed a sigh of relief.

30
00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:12.700
But

31
00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.200
I'm really disappointed with my grandfather

32
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.633
Aqiu, have you considered leaving Su Zhijie?

33
00:01:19.966 --> 00:01:22.100
Start your own company?

34
00:01:22.533 --> 00:01:24.900
I have been overseas all these years

35
00:01:25.566 --> 00:01:28.566
Still saved some money for this

36
00:01:30.166 --> 00:01:31.900
Let's talk about that later.

37
00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.166
After all, I am family with them

38
00:01:35.166 --> 00:01:36.900
OK, thank you.

39
00:01:39.933 --> 00:01:42.866
No matter what decision you make in late autumn

40
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.633
I will support you behind your back
