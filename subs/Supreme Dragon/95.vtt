00:00:05.066 --> 00:00:08.333
Why are Mom and Dad crying so sadly?

2
00:00:08.333 --> 00:00:10.500
Because my mother is an emotional person

3
00:00:11.266 --> 00:00:14.700
Even if all his relatives abandon him

4
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.466
He also didn't want to abandon any of his relatives

5
00:00:16.666 --> 00:00:18.366
Is that kind of person okay?

6
00:00:18.366 --> 00:00:20.466
Okay, if there is no mother

7
00:00:20.566 --> 00:00:22.466
Dad may be today

8
00:00:23.466 --> 00:00:24.666
Still a dear

9
00:00:33.766 --> 00:00:36.033
Universal can go back if you want

10
00:00:36.466 --> 00:00:38.033
Don't leave any regrets for yourself

11
00:00:38.166 --> 00:00:40.766
But don't you like grandpa?

12
00:00:42.666 --> 00:00:44.900
I admit I don't like the old man

13
00:00:45.066 --> 00:00:48.466
Or rather, I don't like all the people in your Su family.

14
00:00:48.466 --> 00:00:49.600
But no way

15
00:00:49.966 --> 00:00:51.400
They are all your relatives

16
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:52.200
bullshit

17
00:00:52.666 --> 00:00:54.566
Twice okay go

18
00:00:54.566 --> 00:00:55.566
The bank's money has returned.

19
00:00:55.566 --> 00:00:56.533
A whole billion.

20
00:00:56.533 --> 00:00:58.200
Enough for you to help the Su family come back immediately

21
00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:59.500
No matter what you decide

22
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.200
I will support you.

23
00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.133
Brother Xiao has an accident

24
00:01:13.133 --> 00:01:16.000
What's the matter? Zhang Family Baicaotang brought a large group of people

25
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.633
They all went to the ancestral villa

26
00:01:17.666 --> 00:01:20.466
What if a herb seller goes there?

27
00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.533
Oops, my brother may not know.

28
00:01:22.533 --> 00:01:23.800
Zhangjia Baicaotang

29
00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.233
Did some improper business behind his back

30
00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.900
I'm afraid the Su family is going to be in big trouble
