00:00:02.333 --> 00:00:04.066
Xiao Chen, what's wrong with you?

2
00:00:04.066 --> 00:00:05.200
Are you not feeling well?

3
00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:06.666
Hurry up and drink some water

4
00:00:06.666 --> 00:00:08.200
No need for Aunt Su

5
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.066
I think Brother Xiao and Late Autumn

6
00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:12.966
It's a perfect match

7
00:00:13.533 --> 00:00:14.633
talented woman

8
00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:15.766
Made in heaven

9
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.400
What, really?

10
00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:20.066
Aunt Su, do you really have the heart to break him up?

11
00:00:20.066 --> 00:00:21.466
What's wrong with Xiao Chen?

12
00:00:21.466 --> 00:00:23.000
Did you get your head hit by a door?

13
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.300
Actually, Aunt Su, I have one more thing to confess.

14
00:00:26.566 --> 00:00:29.966
Our family has already gone bankrupt

15
00:00:30.166 --> 00:00:32.700
I'm just swollen and fat now

16
00:00:32.733 --> 00:00:34.966
Look at this Nanhong agate

17
00:00:34.966 --> 00:00:37.066
It's actually red pebbles.

18
00:00:37.133 --> 00:00:38.300
And this emerald

19
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:39.700
It's a glass bottle.

20
00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.766
These add up to less than 100 yuan

21
00:00:43.133 --> 00:00:45.233
Hey, and this experience

22
00:00:45.766 --> 00:00:49.200
The color fades, it's all fake, Xiao Chen, you are

23
00:00:49.333 --> 00:00:50.133
Never mind.

24
00:00:50.166 --> 00:00:53.133
Please don't force Brother Xiao and Wanqiu to divorce.

25
00:00:53.133 --> 00:00:55.766
They are a match made in heaven.

26
00:00:55.766 --> 00:00:58.400
Well, I have something to do, so I'll go first

27
00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:59.500
Brother Xiao Late Autumn

28
00:00:59.566 --> 00:01:02.366
I wish you a happy union in a hundred years

29
00:01:02.766 --> 00:01:04.666
Have a son early

30
00:01:04.766 --> 00:01:06.633
Xiao Chen Xiao Chen Auntie

31
00:01:08.133 --> 00:01:09.733
Stop doing this shit

32
00:01:09.733 --> 00:01:11.333
This kind of thing is too unreliable

33
00:01:11.333 --> 00:01:14.500
If you are so poor, then you will follow your stinky company.

34
00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:15.866
Live a lifetime

35
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.100
Don't worry about your affairs in the future.
