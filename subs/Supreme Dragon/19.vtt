00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:01.600
I am Su Wanqiu

2
00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:03.500
You're lucky

3
00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:06.900
I actually found such a strange husband

4
00:00:07.133 --> 00:00:08.700
Since you can brag so much

5
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:09.866
Why don't you just say it?

6
00:00:09.866 --> 00:00:11.000
You just spent 10 billion

7
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.100
What about the young master Shenhao who bought Wancheng?

8
00:00:14.166 --> 00:00:16.266
If I told you I was

9
00:00:16.566 --> 00:00:18.600
Do you believe it I believe

10
00:00:19.166 --> 00:00:21.433
No wonder hahaha

11
00:00:22.866 --> 00:00:24.466
Oh husband

12
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.233
You see, a stinky beggar like him speaks for his wife

13
00:00:28.266 --> 00:00:30.400
Why don't you give me a statement?

14
00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:31.866
I'll wait for you to speak

15
00:00:33.133 --> 00:00:36.900
Grandpa Wancheng's check-in is on me

16
00:00:37.066 --> 00:00:38.833
Really good yeah

17
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.966
Although the mighty young master Shenlong is missing

18
00:00:41.966 --> 00:00:44.000
It's hard to get started and end.

19
00:00:44.133 --> 00:00:45.833
But my family name is Zhang

20
00:00:45.933 --> 00:00:47.966
He's a big family.

21
00:00:48.133 --> 00:00:51.166
It's not just about spending some money to manage a simple relationship

22
00:00:51.266 --> 00:00:53.533
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I heard.

23
00:00:53.533 --> 00:00:56.166
This young master is a hands-off shopkeeper

24
00:00:56.366 --> 00:00:58.100
Big and small affairs in the city

25
00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.566
Give it all to this richest man in the Qing family

26
00:01:00.566 --> 00:01:01.600
Tang Long gift

27
00:01:02.133 --> 00:01:04.066
Tang Guardian

28
00:01:04.066 --> 00:01:05.700
It's even easier.

29
00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.033
My dad and Tang Zhu have a good personal relationship

30
00:01:08.133 --> 00:01:09.933
Believe in spending some money

31
00:01:09.933 --> 00:01:12.166
It won't take long for this to be resolved

32
00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.400
Fine. Thank you very much.

33
00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.666
You are really a good son-in-law to our family.

34
00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.700
Grandpa is a family

35
00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.000
Don't be so polite.

36
00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.566
I'll just wait for me.

37
00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.200
Joker, I had no idea you were such a person

38
00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.900
arrogant bragging

39
00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:35.833
self-righteous

40
00:01:35.933 --> 00:01:37.766
You really make me sick.
