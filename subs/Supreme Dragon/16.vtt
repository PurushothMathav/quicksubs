00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:01.366
Hey, okay, okay

2
00:00:01.733 --> 00:00:03.366
Pretty good, huh?

3
00:00:03.366 --> 00:00:05.133
You're finally back!

4
00:00:05.133 --> 00:00:06.700
Come and sit

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:09.000

6
00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:12.666
Grandfather-in-law

7
00:00:12.966 --> 00:00:15.066
What happened just now, laughing so happily

8
00:00:15.066 --> 00:00:17.366
Normal and I have heard it all the way.

9
00:00:17.366 --> 00:00:19.733
Not this Xiao Chan, right?

10
00:00:19.733 --> 00:00:21.266
Ah yes

11
00:00:21.266 --> 00:00:24.433
The man your cousin has been waiting for for six years

12
00:00:24.966 --> 00:00:28.066
He said he had trillions in assets overseas

13
00:00:28.066 --> 00:00:31.200
I also got a company called Tianwang Dian

14
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.766
Hahaha Temple of Heavenly Kings

15
00:00:34.366 --> 00:00:36.600
Isn't that the place where Maitreya Buddha is enshrined?

16
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.466
Hey, I'm late autumn.

17
00:00:39.766 --> 00:00:42.766
The man you are looking for is not just a beggar

18
00:00:43.066 --> 00:00:45.633
Still an idiot hahaha

19
00:00:48.133 --> 00:00:50.600
Grandpa came in a hurry this time

20
00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.166
I have prepared a small gift for you.

21
00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.566
It's just grandpa

22
00:00:54.566 --> 00:00:56.866
This is the treasure of the town store of Baicaotang

23
00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:58.266
30 year old wild ginseng

24
00:00:58.266 --> 00:00:59.766
It's worth hundreds of thousands

25
00:00:59.766 --> 00:01:02.133
Our brother Hao specially brought it to honor you.

26
00:01:02.133 --> 00:01:04.500
Hahaha diva

27
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.533
This is intentional, haha, it should be.

28
00:01:06.533 --> 00:01:08.600
Grandpa likes it

29
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:09.466
Hey

30
00:01:10.166 --> 00:01:11.000
Billionaire

31
00:01:11.366 --> 00:01:14.500
You should have taken a priceless gift, right?

32
00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.566
Take it out and show it to us all

33
00:01:16.933 --> 00:01:18.500
What priceless

34
00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:19.966
Then put it there

35
00:01:20.066 --> 00:01:21.800
It's just a supplement for tens of dollars

36
00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.800
This is

37
00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:29.700
I said Xiao Chen

38
00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:30.966
You're a billionaire.

39
00:01:30.966 --> 00:01:32.966
How to make two pieces of trash for grandpa?

40
00:01:33.666 --> 00:01:36.400
Zhang Yi will tear these two bags in a while

41
00:01:36.466 --> 00:01:38.900
Just throw it in the trash, yeah

42
00:01:42.366 --> 00:01:45.366
Garbage should be in the trash can
