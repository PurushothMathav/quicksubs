00:00:04.766 --> 00:00:06.200
I said Xiao Chen

2
00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:08.600
Although you were a beggar six years ago

3
00:00:09.466 --> 00:00:11.533
But it also delayed our late autumn

4
00:00:11.533 --> 00:00:13.233
Join the wealthy family of Celebration

5
00:00:13.733 --> 00:00:15.466
Now you're back

6
00:00:15.533 --> 00:00:17.633
I want to join our Su family

7
00:00:18.266 --> 00:00:21.300
He also has to see if you have the capital.

8
00:00:21.466 --> 00:00:22.666
You're right.

9
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.100
Xiaoshan heard that you have gone abroad in recent years

10
00:00:26.166 --> 00:00:27.433
How are you doing?

11
00:00:27.533 --> 00:00:29.000
I own an island overseas

12
00:00:29.166 --> 00:00:30.600
Asset words

13
00:00:30.966 --> 00:00:32.000
All over the world

14
00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:33.766
What does the old man mean?

15
00:00:34.266 --> 00:00:36.266
Is to ask about your assets

16
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.733
It's not for you to brag

17
00:00:37.733 --> 00:00:39.233
Just say it

18
00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:40.800
How much do you have in savings?

19
00:00:40.866 --> 00:00:41.900
How much property?

20
00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:42.900
How many luxury cars?

21
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.500
The deposit has not been carefully calculated

22
00:00:46.166 --> 00:00:47.566
Trillions

23
00:00:47.666 --> 00:00:49.200
Real estate

24
00:00:50.133 --> 00:00:51.033
That's not much.

25
00:00:51.066 --> 00:00:52.433
Just tens of thousands of square meters

26
00:00:52.733 --> 00:00:55.466
Well, I don't like cars when I get around.

27
00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.600
They travel by helicopter.

28
00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.100
My own fast

29
00:01:00.866 --> 00:01:01.666
Xiao Chen

30
00:01:02.333 --> 00:01:05.466
Are you kidding us?

31
00:01:05.466 --> 00:01:08.866
Ah, you're just laughing, my liver hurts

32
00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.166
By the way, super rich people like you

33
00:01:12.766 --> 00:01:13.666
That can't be

34
00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:15.666
Your own company?

35
00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:18.300
Company words

36
00:01:18.933 --> 00:01:19.800
Yes.

37
00:01:20.533 --> 00:01:22.966
I started a company called Tianwang Dian

38
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.233
I am the Hall of Heavenly Kings

39
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.400
Hahahaha

40
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.700
Hahahaha

41
00:01:32.933 --> 00:01:35.166
I said Su Wanqiu

42
00:01:35.166 --> 00:01:37.633
This is the man you've been waiting for for six years

43
00:01:37.933 --> 00:01:40.400
Assets are over a trillion.

44
00:01:40.533 --> 00:01:43.433
How about a helicopter ride?

45
00:01:43.466 --> 00:01:46.200
By the way, your company overseas

46
00:01:46.366 --> 00:01:47.900
What could it be?

47
00:01:48.266 --> 00:01:49.600
The begging company

48
00:01:50.266 --> 00:01:52.100
Hahaha clown

49
00:01:52.266 --> 00:01:53.500
Is it shameful to lose?

50
00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:54.866
What I said is true.

51
00:01:54.866 --> 00:01:57.300
You lied to you again for face

52
00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:58.633
The most spineless

53
00:01:59.366 --> 00:02:00.700
So what's up?

54
00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.400
Make everyone laugh so happily
