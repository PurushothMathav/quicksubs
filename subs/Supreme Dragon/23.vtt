00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:03.966
Hello uncle tang

2
00:00:03.966 --> 00:00:06.766
I am Li Jia, the fiancee of Zhang Tianhao of Baicaotang

3
00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:08.800
What did you just call me?

4
00:00:09.333 --> 00:00:10.666
Uncle Tao?

5
00:00:10.766 --> 00:00:11.666
Do I know you?

6
00:00:11.666 --> 00:00:13.200
You come up and get close to me

7
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.000
Secretary

8
00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:17.266
Next time you meet this kind of person, just shoot me out

9
00:00:17.266 --> 00:00:18.266
Ok Mr. Tang

10
00:00:18.266 --> 00:00:19.466
Excuse me?

11
00:00:19.566 --> 00:00:22.166
Mr. Tang was just terrifying me

12
00:00:22.333 --> 00:00:23.433
Please don't be angry.

13
00:00:23.666 --> 00:00:25.966
What about Miss Su's things?

14
00:00:25.966 --> 00:00:26.966
thing

15
00:00:27.533 --> 00:00:28.666
What's that?

16
00:00:29.533 --> 00:00:30.333
Oh.

17
00:00:30.733 --> 00:00:33.766
Didn't I send someone to deliver it to you before?

18
00:00:33.766 --> 00:00:35.000
What are you talking about?

19
00:00:35.166 --> 00:00:37.633
I'm talking about the information of your Su Group.

20
00:00:37.866 --> 00:00:40.800
Mr. Tang, isn't our quota fixed?

21
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.733
No one told me to prepare the materials.

22
00:00:42.733 --> 00:00:44.633
Who told you that it can be predetermined?

23
00:00:44.666 --> 00:00:46.033
Let me tell you something.

24
00:00:46.466 --> 00:00:48.700
Our Wancheng Business Center

25
00:00:48.933 --> 00:00:51.366
To the outside world is to introduce the ability

26
00:00:51.366 --> 00:00:52.800
A company with potential

27
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.166
Let's build one together

28
00:00:54.166 --> 00:00:56.266
World-class business center

29
00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:58.300
Like you do

30
00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.466
I don't even have information about my own company

31
00:01:00.566 --> 00:01:03.766
I seriously doubt the professionalism of your Su Group

32
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:05.966
Not Mr. Tang

33
00:01:05.966 --> 00:01:07.700
I'm Zhang Tianhao's fiancee

34
00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.100
I don't care who you are.

35
00:01:10.133 --> 00:01:13.000
If you want to settle in our city

36
00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.933
You need to show your real information

37
00:01:15.933 --> 00:01:17.866
Don't take these crooked ways

38
00:01:17.966 --> 00:01:18.766
All right.

39
00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.066
Secretary sees off

40
00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:21.900
Mr. Tang

41
00:01:22.466 --> 00:01:23.433
You listen to me.

42
00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:24.900
Can't you understand human language?

43
00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:26.766
Get out of here
