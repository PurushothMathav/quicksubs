00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:01.566
Have you ever considered

2
00:00:01.766 --> 00:00:03.833
Maybe it's Tang Long's discerning eyes

3
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.600
I think late autumn is a talent

4
00:00:05.966 --> 00:00:08.700
This is why we gave the occupancy agreement to our late autumn family

5
00:00:11.333 --> 00:00:13.766
Talent refers to

6
00:00:14.133 --> 00:00:15.000
The back one.

7
00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:16.900
Don't you dare talk nonsense again.

8
00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:18.566
Believe it or not, I'll tear your mouth apart.

9
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.433
Don't be so disbelieving

10
00:00:20.533 --> 00:00:22.200
Call Pang Long over and ask

11
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.200
I knew he had the wrong person.

12
00:00:24.466 --> 00:00:26.733
What are you?

13
00:00:26.733 --> 00:00:28.733
The richest man in the Tang Dynasty has a lot of daily responsibilities

14
00:00:28.733 --> 00:00:31.333
Because of your trivial matter

15
00:00:31.333 --> 00:00:32.400
Come to our Su family

16
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.566
Even if the richest man in Tang is idle to death

17
00:00:34.566 --> 00:00:36.033
He will take care of your anger.

18
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.500
What if I call him over?

19
00:00:39.866 --> 00:00:41.466
If you call him back

20
00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.066
I call you Daddy Three Tones

21
00:00:43.533 --> 00:00:45.233
Ok son

22
00:00:45.333 --> 00:00:47.866
Go away, Master Tang

23
00:00:54.166 --> 00:00:55.000
Hello, son.

24
00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.633
Let's go and greet our guests.

25
00:00:58.966 --> 00:01:00.666
Tang Tang richest man
