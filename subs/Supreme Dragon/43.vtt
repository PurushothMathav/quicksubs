00:00:00.466 --> 00:00:02.000
Hurry up hurry up

2
00:00:02.533 --> 00:00:04.800
Big and powerful

3
00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.366
Dad

4
00:00:06.366 --> 00:00:07.266
Please come.

5
00:00:07.266 --> 00:00:08.333
What time is it?

6
00:00:08.333 --> 00:00:10.700
It seems that the time should be coming soon.

7
00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:12.066
Family is here

8
00:00:12.066 --> 00:00:14.066
Miss Wanqiu is back

9
00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:15.700
Xiao Chen Wanqiu

10
00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:17.433
You are here

11
00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:18.800
Li Mingqiang

12
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.766
I remember the last time we were here

13
00:00:21.766 --> 00:00:23.033
That little table I made

14
00:00:23.333 --> 00:00:25.933
Don't mention what's already in the past

15
00:00:25.933 --> 00:00:28.400
Are you the master today?

16
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:29.666
Yes or no?

17
00:00:29.666 --> 00:00:31.966
Grandpa, there are too many of us.

18
00:00:32.133 --> 00:00:33.666
Can't sit at a table

19
00:00:34.566 --> 00:00:38.466
Why take Tianhao to make a small table?

20
00:00:38.466 --> 00:00:40.133
Dad, you're crazy

21
00:00:40.133 --> 00:00:41.500
Let you go, you go

22
00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.100
So much nonsense fast

23
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:47.900
Voila!

24
00:00:51.966 --> 00:00:55.466
Look, I didn't expect you to call you filial

25
00:00:55.466 --> 00:00:56.866
Such a good man

26
00:00:57.866 --> 00:00:58.800
Xiao Chen

27
00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:03.366
I didn't expect you to be the boss behind the scenes

28
00:01:03.366 --> 00:01:05.200
Our entry agreement this time?

29
00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:06.633
It's all your fault.

30
00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:08.266
come

31
00:01:09.366 --> 00:01:11.266
In the future, let's take a vacation.

32
00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:12.966
Waited a year

33
00:01:12.966 --> 00:01:14.600
Grandpa toasts you

34
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.866
Come on, old man

35
00:01:16.866 --> 00:01:18.966
I feel like you have misunderstood a little bit.

36
00:01:18.966 --> 00:01:20.800
Sadness is not a problem
