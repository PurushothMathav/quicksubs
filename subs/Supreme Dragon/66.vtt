00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:05.766
Auntie, why are you here?

2
00:00:05.766 --> 00:00:07.066
Stop by and take a look.

3
00:00:07.066 --> 00:00:09.900
By the way, has the contract of Sun's Group been signed?

4
00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:12.000
Sign up to hire grandpa happy

5
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.800
Ready for us to take over this project

6
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.166
So that's a double happiness.

7
00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:17.433
Double happiness

8
00:00:17.466 --> 00:00:18.266
Xiao Chen

9
00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:20.366
You are going to do something in two days.

10
00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:21.733
Sure. What's up?

11
00:00:21.733 --> 00:00:24.466
Divorced our marriage in late autumn

12
00:00:25.266 --> 00:00:27.266
What nonsense are you talking about?

13
00:00:27.333 --> 00:00:28.200
Late Autumn

14
00:00:28.866 --> 00:00:31.466
Do you really want to hang yourself from a tree?

15
00:00:32.066 --> 00:00:34.566
He is a beggar with no money and no power

16
00:00:34.566 --> 00:00:36.366
But he is Xiaocao's father

17
00:00:36.366 --> 00:00:38.600
It is my husband who has worshiped heaven and earth and married

18
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:39.500
Dad can change

19
00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:40.900
Husband can also change

20
00:00:42.166 --> 00:00:43.700
There will be a blind date tomorrow

21
00:00:43.966 --> 00:00:46.900
You go see me

22
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.033
You must listen to me on this matter

23
00:00:50.466 --> 00:00:51.366
Call aunt

24
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.900
Grass, um, do you like this girl?

25
00:01:00.466 --> 00:01:01.666
What do you mean?

26
00:01:01.666 --> 00:01:04.900
Although my grandmother looks fierce

27
00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.000
But I will give Xiaocao a gift.

28
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.400
Well, I will also make delicious food for the grass

29
00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.600
So the grass doesn't hate him

30
00:01:14.733 --> 00:01:17.900
Dad, um, will you leave us again?

31
00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:18.833
It won't happen.

32
00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.233
Dad will never leave me again
