00:00:00.866 --> 00:00:02.166
What's the problem?

2
00:00:02.933 --> 00:00:06.600
He is just a smear for the family

3
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.200
Bitch who got kicked out

4
00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:10.633
You talk about how I will hand over the agreement with him

5
00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:14.566
Grandpa, there must be something wrong with this agreement.

6
00:00:14.566 --> 00:00:15.966
You are jealous

7
00:00:16.133 --> 00:00:17.566
Jealous of our late autumn?

8
00:00:17.566 --> 00:00:19.033
Ability is stronger than you

9
00:00:19.133 --> 00:00:20.300
You are talking nonsense.

10
00:00:21.266 --> 00:00:22.633
He can sign this agreement

11
00:00:22.766 --> 00:00:24.300
Pure shit luck

12
00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:25.300
maybe

13
00:00:26.266 --> 00:00:29.833
Grandpa, maybe Tang Long got the wrong person

14
00:00:29.966 --> 00:00:32.400
Yeah, saving is nothing

15
00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:33.766
How could it be so easy?

16
00:00:33.766 --> 00:00:35.000
I wrote down the agreement

17
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Tell me about it.

18
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.600
It must be the operation problem of the young master of the Zhang family. The effect is correct.

19
00:00:39.766 --> 00:00:40.966
It must be so.

20
00:00:41.266 --> 00:00:43.066
It's because Tang Long got the wrong person

21
00:00:43.066 --> 00:00:45.400
Will you kick me out and sign a deal with him?

22
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.666
Grandpa, so it should be me who should be promoted and get a raise

23
00:00:49.666 --> 00:00:51.066
Isn't it autumn last night?

24
00:00:51.566 --> 00:00:53.366
Grandpa is not like that

25
00:00:53.366 --> 00:00:55.366
Boss Tang was carefully prepared by me

26
00:00:55.366 --> 00:00:56.666
Moved by sincerity

27
00:00:56.666 --> 00:00:58.066
Not what he said

28
00:00:58.966 --> 00:01:00.400
Well prepared

29
00:01:00.533 --> 00:01:01.700
Also sincere

30
00:01:02.266 --> 00:01:03.366
Miss Su Wanqiu

31
00:01:03.366 --> 00:01:04.600
Let me ask you something.

32
00:01:04.733 --> 00:01:07.000
How much is your sincerity worth?

33
00:01:07.966 --> 00:01:09.900
Grandpa, this agreement is really not high

34
00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.633
I think it is indeed possible that Teng Chong has mistaken the person.

35
00:01:15.766 --> 00:01:16.800
Otherwise

36
00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.600
Your ability to work in late autumn

37
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.566
Can't hold anything

38
00:01:20.966 --> 00:01:23.000
Silly King Silver

39
00:01:23.866 --> 00:01:26.466
The occupancy agreement is from our late autumn.

40
00:01:26.466 --> 00:01:28.433
You decided to reward Suschmann

41
00:01:29.733 --> 00:01:32.300
It's just a nonsense speaker like you who doesn't know right and wrong

42
00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:34.766
Are you not afraid that those who truly pay will feel cold?

43
00:01:34.766 --> 00:01:37.800
Shut up and dare not question me
