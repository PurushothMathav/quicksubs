00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:01.500
Li Qiang

2
00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.466
How much did you get from Su Wanqiang?

3
00:00:04.566 --> 00:00:06.166
How dare you slander me like this

4
00:00:06.666 --> 00:00:08.500
Grandpa, don't trust him.

5
00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:10.900
Grandpa, Uncle Li didn't talk about my benefits

6
00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:12.000
And it's true.

7
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.166
You are talking nonsense.

8
00:00:13.566 --> 00:00:15.300
You have always been in charge of this project.

9
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:17.166
You are just afraid that others will say that you are a kickback.

10
00:00:17.166 --> 00:00:19.000
Just poured dirty water on me

11
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.033
Grandpa Aqiu

12
00:00:21.566 --> 00:00:23.166
You have disappointed me so much.

13
00:00:23.166 --> 00:00:25.600
Grandpa, what do you mean?

14
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.300
Do the math yourself

15
00:00:27.766 --> 00:00:30.600
6 years ago, you regretted Kun

16
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:32.966
Dude you stinky beggar

17
00:00:33.533 --> 00:00:36.266
Buy people's hearts after taking it back six years later

18
00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:40.166
I want to ask the Su family to fall into a place of eternal disaster

19
00:00:40.466 --> 00:00:43.266
Su Zhenguo, are you an old fool?

20
00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:45.466
What are you doing with your old debts from six years ago?

21
00:00:45.466 --> 00:00:47.633
I already know my grandfather's attitude

22
00:00:48.766 --> 00:00:50.100
No matter what I say

23
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.300
What is right or wrong to do?

24
00:00:52.666 --> 00:00:55.966
Grandpa will never forgive me for my mistakes 6 years ago

25
00:00:55.966 --> 00:00:58.133
Even if this matter is nailed to the plate

26
00:00:58.133 --> 00:00:59.700
Suzman did the nail

27
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:01.900
Grandpa still speaks for him

28
00:01:01.933 --> 00:01:03.033
Why is that?

29
00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.166
Because Su Shiman's Lao Guo is the Zhang Family Baicaotang

30
00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:09.266
And my husband

31
00:01:09.733 --> 00:01:11.466
Just a beggar

32
00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:12.700
shut up

33
00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.200
You are so tiger teeth
