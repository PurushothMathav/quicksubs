00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.766
Excuse me, who is Miss Su Wanxiu?

2
00:00:03.966 --> 00:00:05.233
You are

3
00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:07.266
I'm here for a blind date.

4
00:00:07.266 --> 00:00:09.366
Ouch, Wenhao, right?

5
00:00:09.533 --> 00:00:10.900
Please sit down please sit down

6
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:18.900
What are you still doing?

7
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.800
Hurry up and open the window for someone

8
00:00:20.966 --> 00:00:25.200
It's okay, we'll order first so that we can walk.

9
00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:27.300
Wenqiu

10
00:00:27.766 --> 00:00:30.866
Wenhao's family does jade business

11
00:00:30.866 --> 00:00:33.266
In the tutorial, it's one of the best

12
00:00:33.933 --> 00:00:36.033
And ah, in my celebration room

13
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.066
Liu Xiaoyu, the queen of jewelry, is still his godmother

14
00:00:40.133 --> 00:00:42.633
It's Liu Xiaoyu, of course

15
00:00:44.266 --> 00:00:45.166
Go one by one

16
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.866
Our home is just to sell some agate jadeite.

17
00:00:48.866 --> 00:00:51.300
20 million profit a year

18
00:00:51.566 --> 00:00:52.733
You make no money.

19
00:00:52.733 --> 00:00:53.866
After dinner

20
00:00:53.866 --> 00:00:57.033
What kind of store have we been to?

21
00:00:57.133 --> 00:00:59.466
Pick me up and buy

22
00:01:00.333 --> 00:01:02.233
How can we be embarrassed?

23
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.600
Enough late autumn?

24
00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.166
What's so funny about that?

25
00:01:09.166 --> 00:01:11.666
Late Autumn doesn't want to laugh because of seeing Mr. Chen

26
00:01:12.266 --> 00:01:14.133
But because of Mr. Chen's identity

27
00:01:14.133 --> 00:01:15.866
Think about Mr. Chen

28
00:01:16.333 --> 00:01:18.166
When are you really coming, son?
