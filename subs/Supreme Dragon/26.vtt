1
00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:01.566
The day of the investment promotion meeting

2
00:00:01.566 --> 00:00:03.500
You came back after my husband delivered the ball

3
00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:04.866
At that time

4
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.866
You took the occupancy agreement prepared by Officer Su's

5
00:00:08.166 --> 00:00:08.966
Rob him

6
00:00:09.766 --> 00:00:10.633
Yes

7
00:00:12.966 --> 00:00:16.100
I am very satisfied with your performance, Miss Su

8
00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:19.100
And I especially recognize your information.

9
00:00:19.466 --> 00:00:22.766
Although your Su Group is not outstanding now

10
00:00:23.066 --> 00:00:25.900
But I believe that under the leadership of Miss Su

11
00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:27.033
The future can be expected

12
00:00:28.866 --> 00:00:30.400
Opportunity to settle in Wancheng

13
00:00:31.066 --> 00:00:32.066
Here you go.

14
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.600
Okay, our Su Group will definitely not let Tang

15
00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:36.766
Always disappointed

16
00:00:42.766 --> 00:00:44.900
Tutorial I got the company agreement

17
00:00:45.166 --> 00:00:47.400
I knew you would succeed

18
00:00:48.466 --> 00:00:51.333
But I just think it's a little too fast.

19
00:00:51.333 --> 00:00:53.166
Something seems to be wrong now

20
00:00:53.166 --> 00:00:54.366
What's wrong?

21
00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:55.900
Hard work will be rewarded

22
00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:57.266
You deserve it.

23
00:00:57.533 --> 00:00:59.166
Let's go back

24
00:00:59.866 --> 00:01:01.933
It's time for them to impress you

25
00:01:01.933 --> 00:01:02.733
Let's go

26
00:01:08.466 --> 00:01:11.000
Hey, who let you in?

27
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.166
Get out of here!

28
00:01:12.166 --> 00:01:13.700
They can both survive

29
00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.200
Why can't we come?

30
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.866
This is the high-level memory of the Su Group

31
00:01:17.966 --> 00:01:19.433
You two are not eligible to participate

32
00:01:19.533 --> 00:01:22.100
Then our family will be the head of the design department in late autumn?
