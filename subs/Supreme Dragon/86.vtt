00:00:00.866 --> 00:00:03.066
What the hell is going on with him?

2
00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:05.566
I contacted Sun Zhonghua privately for you.

3
00:00:05.966 --> 00:00:07.966
Told him all about it

4
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.866
He was angry with the actions of the Su Group

5
00:00:10.866 --> 00:00:13.133
So I decided to work with you alone

6
00:00:13.133 --> 00:00:14.333
Oh cooperate with me

7
00:00:14.333 --> 00:00:16.533
Yeah, I told him.

8
00:00:16.533 --> 00:00:19.100
You decide to start your own clothing company

9
00:00:19.266 --> 00:00:21.766
I run a company, but I don't have the money.

10
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.900
With Sun's Group, this bag of walnuts will not lose money.

11
00:00:27.933 --> 00:00:29.833
Use him as collateral capital

12
00:00:30.133 --> 00:00:31.733
Don't talk about 10 million

13
00:00:31.733 --> 00:00:33.500
100 million will be brought back to you.

14
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.500
How do you have Sun's Group's walnuts?

15
00:00:37.466 --> 00:00:39.300
Hey, isn't that right?

16
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.866
How do I feel?

17
00:00:40.933 --> 00:00:43.066
I keep getting kissed by you in the nose seat

18
00:00:43.066 --> 00:00:45.700
Yes, no?

19
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:46.766
I'll tell you later.

20
00:00:46.766 --> 00:00:47.866
I went down to take a shower

21
00:00:47.866 --> 00:00:49.033
You can stop.

22
00:00:52.866 --> 00:00:53.666
chairperson

23
00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:55.500
The Sun Group has cut off all our business

24
00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.166
News also came from Tangcun in Wancheng

25
00:00:58.166 --> 00:00:59.600
Cancelled our stay

26
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:00.500
And not only that.

27
00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.300
Borrow money to cooperate with several fabric suppliers

28
00:01:02.466 --> 00:01:04.433
It's all like it was negotiated in advance

29
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.400
All to urge us to end the payment.

30
00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:10.300
It's a wall down and everyone pushes it, Dad

31
00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.500
We don't have that much money in our account

32
00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:13.900
Go on like this

33
00:01:14.166 --> 00:01:16.333
My Su family has to go bankrupt

34
00:01:16.333 --> 00:01:17.666
Follow me through this hotel

35
00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:19.766
How much will it cost?

36
00:01:20.166 --> 00:01:21.600
This conservative estimate

37
00:01:21.933 --> 00:01:23.366
Get 20 million
