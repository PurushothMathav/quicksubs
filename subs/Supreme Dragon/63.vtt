00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:06.000
When I was a child, my parents left early

2
00:00:06.466 --> 00:00:09.666
I thought about being alone and ignoring everyone's dissuasion

3
00:00:09.933 --> 00:00:11.266
Bring me up

4
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.200
He taught me to read.

5
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.700
Teach me to write

6
00:00:17.766 --> 00:00:20.200
Even all my talent for fashion design

7
00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:21.800
He taught me that.

8
00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.833
It can be said that my aunt is my mother

9
00:00:25.733 --> 00:00:27.366
In fact, on the wedding day

10
00:00:27.533 --> 00:00:28.900
What I most want to see

11
00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:31.066
It is the aunt who can come to the scene

12
00:00:31.066 --> 00:00:33.933
But my aunt has been married to the bay since

13
00:00:33.933 --> 00:00:35.800
I never saw her again

14
00:00:36.366 --> 00:00:37.433
So

15
00:00:38.266 --> 00:00:39.500
You have decided

16
00:00:40.266 --> 00:00:42.533
Ask Su Jiaqiang about the resentment towards the Su family during the holiday

17
00:00:42.533 --> 00:00:43.200
Chaos

18
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.366
Xiao Wu is the best person in the world for me

19
00:00:46.666 --> 00:00:48.366
I didn't want to embarrass him.

20
00:00:48.366 --> 00:00:49.400
Then let you taste it

21
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.566
But aren't you going to hang Su Shiman?

22
00:00:52.566 --> 00:00:54.033
No really don't do that for me

23
00:00:54.166 --> 00:00:54.966
But

24
00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:58.233
Since the wife has let go of the past

25
00:00:58.533 --> 00:01:00.666
I'm a big man arguing

26
00:01:00.866 --> 00:01:02.366
Doesn't that look like me?

27
00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:03.300
Dramatic book

28
00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:06.100
Come on, the opera is narrow

29
00:01:09.866 --> 00:01:11.466
Hey grass

30
00:01:11.766 --> 00:01:13.000
Where did you get the toys?

31
00:01:13.333 --> 00:01:15.500
Bag in that bag

32
00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:18.866
Is this toy brand new?

33
00:01:19.066 --> 00:01:19.866
You see

34
00:01:20.766 --> 00:01:22.166
The label hasn't been removed yet.

35
00:01:22.366 --> 00:01:24.666
Didn't you say exposure fake? Let me take a look.

36
00:01:37.533 --> 00:01:39.800
One or two 0

37
00:01:40.733 --> 00:01:43.400
It seems that Xiaobu still blesses us

38
00:01:45.133 --> 00:01:46.200
Kind of interesting.

39
00:01:46.566 --> 00:01:48.600
Alright Aqiu

40
00:01:49.166 --> 00:01:50.166
Let's go eat

41
00:01:50.266 --> 00:01:51.100
After dinner

42
00:01:51.966 --> 00:01:53.100
Gotta get up
