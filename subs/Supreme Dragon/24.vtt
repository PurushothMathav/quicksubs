00:00:01.333 --> 00:00:03.633
Hey, how about what?

2
00:00:03.733 --> 00:00:05.333
Have you got the occupancy agreement?

3
00:00:05.333 --> 00:00:07.166
Yeah, where's the deal?

4
00:00:07.166 --> 00:00:08.933
Take it out and show it to us

5
00:00:08.933 --> 00:00:11.800
Grandpa, I got kicked out

6
00:00:11.933 --> 00:00:13.366
The agreement was not received.

7
00:00:13.666 --> 00:00:15.066
What's the matter?

8
00:00:15.166 --> 00:00:16.566
Didn't you mention my name?

9
00:00:16.566 --> 00:00:17.566
No mention of Bai Su Zhen

10
00:00:18.066 --> 00:00:20.166
I mentioned it all

11
00:00:20.366 --> 00:00:21.733
It's not like smoke.

12
00:00:21.733 --> 00:00:23.066
Can't hear anything

13
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.966
I was kicked out before I could finish my sentence

14
00:00:25.966 --> 00:00:29.466
He also said not to do such small tricks in the back

15
00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.366
Forget it, go back

16
00:00:31.366 --> 00:00:33.766
The shy Su family does not have this blessing

17
00:00:33.766 --> 00:00:35.366
Hey, old man, old man

18
00:00:36.133 --> 00:00:38.100
The dorms were chased out by praying mantises

19
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.933
Don't be afraid of things, you are fully poisoned

20
00:00:40.933 --> 00:00:43.666
Do you see any other advantages in our late autumn?

21
00:00:43.666 --> 00:00:45.266
It's impossible to be fully prepared.

22
00:00:45.733 --> 00:00:47.833
Do you want me to try?

23
00:00:48.333 --> 00:00:49.566
You stinky beggar

24
00:00:49.666 --> 00:00:51.033
Where is the bag you are talking about here?

25
00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:53.733
Yeah, get out of here, don't be embarrassed here

26
00:00:53.733 --> 00:00:55.800
Now it's you, the broom star.

27
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.033
Just brought the US shipment to us and walked back

28
00:01:05.066 --> 00:01:06.766
Or forget it

29
00:01:06.933 --> 00:01:08.500
The Su Group is still too weak

30
00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.266
There is no chance to settle in Wancheng at all

31
00:01:10.266 --> 00:01:12.466
What are you talking about? We're here.

32
00:01:12.466 --> 00:01:14.066
How do you know if you don't try it?

33
00:01:14.066 --> 00:01:15.266
But no but

34
00:01:15.933 --> 00:01:18.066
All you have to do now is one thing

35
00:01:18.066 --> 00:01:21.000
Go in and negotiate the settlement agreement

36
00:01:21.066 --> 00:01:22.400
Then we take the residency agreement

37
00:01:22.733 --> 00:01:24.466
Come and beat those bastards hard

38
00:01:24.766 --> 00:01:26.400
Do you really believe me?

39
00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.600
Even if the whole world doesn't believe you, I will believe you

40
00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:34.366
Ok I will go

41
00:01:35.133 --> 00:01:35.933
up
