What are you doing here? I'm a writer

2
00:00:09.866 --> 00:00:11.400
What's the matter dad

3
00:00:11.966 --> 00:00:13.200
I want to ask

4
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.066
Last time you said our last genuine treasure

5
00:00:16.066 --> 00:00:16.900
Angel Star

6
00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:17.866
What's wrong?

7
00:00:17.866 --> 00:00:19.833
Loved ones are untrustworthy

8
00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:21.966
Not surnamed Su

9
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.666
The surname is Xiao, why are you suddenly asking this?

10
00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.466
It's okay, just not surnamed Su

11
00:00:27.666 --> 00:00:29.600
Although his surname is not Su

12
00:00:29.933 --> 00:00:31.833
But his wife seems to be surnamed Su

13
00:00:31.966 --> 00:00:34.266
What is it called Su Wanqiu?

14
00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:36.800
Hello Wang Hao

15
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:38.033
What's your trouble?

16
00:00:38.333 --> 00:00:41.833
Why do I seem to be in trouble?

17
00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.166
Come to blind date, kill on blind date

18
00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.100
I guess that's it.

19
00:00:47.166 --> 00:00:48.466
What to ask for

20
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.933
Shen Wenhao, are you impatient?

21
00:00:50.933 --> 00:00:52.966
How dare you hit Brother Xiao's wife?

22
00:00:53.133 --> 00:00:55.666
I love I owe money now I know

23
00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:58.233
It was his aunt who asked me to come

24
00:00:58.266 --> 00:01:02.266
If I knew, I wouldn't dare to die

25
00:01:02.966 --> 00:01:04.666
So what should I do now?

26
00:01:04.666 --> 00:01:05.666
How do I know?

27
00:01:06.066 --> 00:01:07.400
Shen Wenhao, I warn you

28
00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:08.800
It doesn't matter if you want to die

29
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.166
But don't hold me back

30
00:01:19.966 --> 00:01:22.400
Your item is too fake.

31
00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.000
It's all rubbish, you're fucking courting death

32
00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.566
Hey, hey, I'll really change this one for you.
