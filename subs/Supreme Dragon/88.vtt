00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:01.200
Diva

2
00:00:01.766 --> 00:00:03.700
This time is different

3
00:00:03.933 --> 00:00:06.300
If you can help our Su family get through this difficult time

4
00:00:06.533 --> 00:00:09.133
Then you are the great benefactor of our Su family

5
00:00:09.133 --> 00:00:11.266
Isn't it that our Zhang family doesn't want to help with this?

6
00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:13.600
It's 20 million in cash

7
00:00:13.766 --> 00:00:15.200
It's really not a decimal sum.

8
00:00:15.966 --> 00:00:17.866
Our Zhang family really can't take it out.

9
00:00:20.166 --> 00:00:23.066
If you quit, even if you borrow it from relatives and friends

10
00:00:23.733 --> 00:00:25.400
How can I borrow so much in a while?

11
00:00:27.333 --> 00:00:30.466
This god is going to wrong my Su family

12
00:00:30.533 --> 00:00:31.766
But I have an idea.

13
00:00:32.166 --> 00:00:34.566
You can quickly help our Su family get here.

14
00:00:34.933 --> 00:00:37.100
What can we do for a loan?

15
00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:38.200
Oh no no no

16
00:00:38.366 --> 00:00:39.500
What about the loan?

17
00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:40.866
We've already tried

18
00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.766
Sujia is on the cusp of a trend

19
00:00:43.766 --> 00:00:46.266
Your bank, you don't take us

20
00:00:46.266 --> 00:00:47.600
I have a way to do this.

21
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.100
My second uncle is a senior executive in the credit department of a bank with a relative

22
00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.666
He can lend you money.

23
00:00:52.966 --> 00:00:54.066
I mean it.

24
00:00:54.066 --> 00:00:56.166
But my uncle has one condition

25
00:00:56.766 --> 00:00:58.833
You need to discuss it with your elders.

26
00:01:00.066 --> 00:01:01.666
What conditions?

27
00:01:03.066 --> 00:01:05.100
He needs your Su family

28
00:01:05.466 --> 00:01:09.433
Use Nanshanping's natural gas as collateral?
