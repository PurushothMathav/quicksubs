00:00:04.666 --> 00:00:06.066
Count the ball

2
00:00:06.066 --> 00:00:07.100
You come out

3
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:13.733
Look at you now.

4
00:00:13.733 --> 00:00:15.600
People are not ghosts

5
00:00:15.733 --> 00:00:17.900
You just want such a little rebate

6
00:00:18.133 --> 00:00:20.766
Do such a heinous thing?

7
00:00:21.466 --> 00:00:23.266
I don't have it, if you don't

8
00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.500
Why is everyone in the company scolding you?

9
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.133
I taught you from a young age

10
00:00:27.133 --> 00:00:29.566
If you are poor and have no money

11
00:00:29.566 --> 00:00:31.966
You can't do anything unconscionable

12
00:00:31.966 --> 00:00:34.100
I said I didn't do it.

13
00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.766
It was Li Qiang who colluded with the company to frame me

14
00:00:36.766 --> 00:00:37.966
You are talking nonsense.

15
00:00:38.566 --> 00:00:40.333
Li Qiang has been with the company for more than 20 years

16
00:00:40.333 --> 00:00:41.866
Why did he frame you?

17
00:00:41.966 --> 00:00:43.100
In this world

18
00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.266
One wants another.

19
00:00:46.066 --> 00:00:47.766
Or the competition for fame and fortune

20
00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:50.933
Or I break up with him

21
00:00:50.933 --> 00:00:53.200
There is no battle between fame and fortune in different departments

22
00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.633
Is that the other ones?

23
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.233
Su Shi scolded Xiao Gu to death

24
00:00:57.466 --> 00:00:59.700
Late Autumn was saved by you yourself

25
00:01:00.366 --> 00:01:02.166
You question his character

26
00:01:02.166 --> 00:01:04.466
You're questioning your own character.

27
00:01:04.566 --> 00:01:04.866
save

28
00:01:04.866 --> 00:01:07.500
I have never betrayed my words in the hardest and most painful times

29
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.033
Now all for that little kickback

30
00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.466
I'm going to ruin my great future

31
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.433
Where are you going, sir?

32
00:01:16.866 --> 00:01:18.233
I'm going to get justice for you

33
00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.566
Hahaha, isn't this Yunqing?

34
00:01:24.566 --> 00:01:26.600
Long time no see!

35
00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.366
Why did you frame Wanqiu with the surname Li?

36
00:01:30.733 --> 00:01:33.433
In debt? That's what he did

37
00:01:33.466 --> 00:01:36.666
Impossible. I know the character of late autumn best

38
00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:38.866
You can go back to the company and explain it to me right now.

39
00:01:38.966 --> 00:01:40.366
Repair Gatekio's innocence

40
00:01:40.366 --> 00:01:41.166
Let's go

41
00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:42.100
Ah!

42
00:01:42.766 --> 00:01:45.700
Innocent, you are funny
