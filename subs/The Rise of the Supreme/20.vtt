1
00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:01.966
only

2
00:00:02.866 --> 00:00:03.866
Just what?

3
00:00:03.866 --> 00:00:05.966
Someone started in the medicinal herbs

4
00:00:09.766 --> 00:00:12.266
What's wrong with this medicine?

5
00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:13.900
Medicine is not wrong

6
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:15.666
It's all my pharmacy

7
00:00:16.533 --> 00:00:17.400
But

8
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.100
sister

9
00:00:19.566 --> 00:00:23.233
An expert appeared beside our uncle

10
00:00:23.333 --> 00:00:25.900
But isn't uncle being locked up?

11
00:00:26.133 --> 00:00:26.933
This

12
00:00:27.366 --> 00:00:30.400
When I prescribed the medicine, I listed the year of the medicine

13
00:00:30.466 --> 00:00:31.466
Deliveryman

14
00:00:31.466 --> 00:00:34.300
I deliberately replaced the annual fee for medicinal materials with an older year

15
00:00:34.466 --> 00:00:37.366
There is no danger, but the doctor is in a coma without medicine

16
00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.600
Could it be that the pharmacy delivered the wrong goods?

17
00:00:42.766 --> 00:00:43.566
sister

18
00:00:43.966 --> 00:00:45.066
Do you believe it or not?

19
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.300
Tomorrow our uncle will jump out

20
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.033
Back in power
