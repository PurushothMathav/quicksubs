1
00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:01.166
Blood Skull

2
00:00:01.733 --> 00:00:03.233
Why did you hurt my parents?

3
00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:06.300
Your father and I both chose the blood skeleton back then

4
00:00:06.866 --> 00:00:08.466
Since he is selected

5
00:00:08.533 --> 00:00:09.700
Why did you hurt him?

6
00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:12.500
Because your father turned them down.

7
00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.200
Just because my father rejected them

8
00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.300
They're going to murder my father

9
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.300
If they did come after your father

10
00:00:19.333 --> 00:00:21.566
You don't have to spend such a big deal

11
00:00:22.066 --> 00:00:23.400
That is to say

12
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:25.100
There are 6 more possibilities

13
00:00:25.166 --> 00:00:28.000
I couldn't find the bodies of your parents back then

14
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.233
They just want to find my father

15
00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:32.700
There's no need for such a big battle

16
00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:35.233
Aren't they afraid of accidents?

17
00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.466
That seems risky.

18
00:00:38.733 --> 00:00:40.766
But there's no risk at all.

19
00:00:40.766 --> 00:00:42.666
Before your father had an accident

20
00:00:42.666 --> 00:00:44.766
It has been protected first

21
00:00:44.866 --> 00:00:45.966
Except these

22
00:00:45.966 --> 00:00:46.966
What else do you know?
