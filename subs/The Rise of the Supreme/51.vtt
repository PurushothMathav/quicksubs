1
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:04.800
Take it out

2
00:00:09.366 --> 00:00:11.100
It's fake.

3
00:00:11.733 --> 00:00:13.333
Don't talk nonsense.

4
00:00:13.333 --> 00:00:16.066
Personally identified, no flaws at all

5
00:00:16.066 --> 00:00:17.666
How could it be fake?

6
00:00:18.066 --> 00:00:21.666
Are you sure you have what he identified?

7
00:00:25.266 --> 00:00:26.933
Who sent you?

8
00:00:26.933 --> 00:00:28.166
He's my big brother.

9
00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.566
Did you think I would tell you?

10
00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.366
Little brother, I'm so sorry.

11
00:00:34.366 --> 00:00:36.866
I'm afraid it's going to implicate you this time

12
00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:38.633
That's not the case

13
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.133
Why don't we talk about passwords?

14
00:00:41.133 --> 00:00:43.366
When is the sale?

15
00:00:43.366 --> 00:00:44.933
Still in the mood to talk about business

16
00:00:44.933 --> 00:00:46.866
Three people 3 million

17
00:00:46.966 --> 00:00:49.033
You pay and I'll do it

18
00:00:49.366 --> 00:00:50.366
Are you serious?

19
00:00:50.366 --> 00:00:52.266
Nonsense at this time

20
00:00:52.266 --> 00:00:53.700
Am I still in the mood to joke with you?

21
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.100
Okay, no 3 million

22
00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.300
If it can solve them later?

23
00:00:58.300 --> 00:00:59.866
You are my brother
