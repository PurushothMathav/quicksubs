Grandpa Lao Tzu

2
00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:05.300
I just got a message.

3
00:00:05.566 --> 00:00:08.800
My parents might still be alive

4
00:00:10.933 --> 00:00:13.866
My parents might not be dead.

5
00:00:14.966 --> 00:00:16.666
Jeongnam is still alive

6
00:00:17.866 --> 00:00:18.866
Just be alive

7
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:20.800
Just be alive

8
00:00:22.933 --> 00:00:24.400
What the hell is going on?

9
00:00:24.666 --> 00:00:26.100
It's not that there are no bones left

10
00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.966
So you think it's all the blood skeleton's doing?

11
00:00:29.966 --> 00:00:31.766
Seems like you know the blood skeleton too

12
00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:34.200
Your dad said this before

13
00:00:35.566 --> 00:00:38.066
It's just that we all believed in ourselves at the time

14
00:00:38.066 --> 00:00:41.233
Didn't take it to heart

15
00:00:42.666 --> 00:00:44.766
What Qin Yuhong said is true

16
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:47.866
Writing skeletons costs so much to pick up

17
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.700
After all, there is a big plan

18
00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.333
Then why has it taken so long?

19
00:00:53.333 --> 00:00:54.966
No news
