00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.466
Young Master Yang, don't listen to this kid

2
00:00:03.466 --> 00:00:05.300
It's not the real thing.

3
00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:06.800
But it is also an antique

4
00:00:07.533 --> 00:00:09.466
Aren't you contradicting yourself?

5
00:00:09.566 --> 00:00:11.766
Now everyone knows to imitate the ancients

6
00:00:11.766 --> 00:00:13.800
Did the ancients deserve it?

7
00:00:14.133 --> 00:00:15.200
little brother

8
00:00:15.266 --> 00:00:19.233
Do you mean this painting is copied by the ancients?

9
00:00:20.733 --> 00:00:22.833
So how do you know for sure?

10
00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.833
It's easy, just chop the Crane fireworks

11
00:00:27.366 --> 00:00:29.433
This guy doesn't talk a lot

12
00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.700
You have something to say when distinguishing between true and false

13
00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:34.166
Who will pay for the loss of hundreds of millions?

14
00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:35.700
Mr. Yang

15
00:00:35.766 --> 00:00:38.300
You already knew it was fake, right?

16
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.100
Although this painting is beautiful

17
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.300
But the value isn't quite right either.

18
00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:45.966
The seven or eight hundred thousand is not a problem.

19
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.266
This elementary school actually knows what I'm thinking

20
00:00:49.466 --> 00:00:51.033
Little brother joked

21
00:00:51.966 --> 00:00:54.266
If it weren't for the little brother, you would know the pearl

22
00:00:54.266 --> 00:00:57.066
I'm afraid I'll never know if this painting is beautiful
