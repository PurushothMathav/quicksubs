1
00:00:03.166 --> 00:00:04.266
Bid reserve price 10 billion

2
00:00:04.266 --> 00:00:06.500
Each bid must not be less than 10 billion

3
00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:08.100
Yu Feng Consortium 100 billion

4
00:00:08.933 --> 00:00:09.900
Direct 100 billion

5
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.300
This is a one-time payment.

6
00:00:12.733 --> 00:00:15.266
Yes, the Qin family withdrew 100 billion this time

7
00:00:15.266 --> 00:00:16.866
This is too scary

8
00:00:17.933 --> 00:00:20.800
Xingyao Consortium 150 billion

9
00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:22.100
180 billion

10
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.966
The most money the Qin family can mobilize

11
00:00:24.966 --> 00:00:26.200
Only about 100 billion

12
00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.366
Could it be that the Qin family is also looking for someone to cooperate with?

13
00:00:28.366 --> 00:00:29.666
Who will they look for?

14
00:00:29.966 --> 00:00:31.900
Xingyao Consortium 200 billion

15
00:00:32.766 --> 00:00:36.500
210 billion is not right, 150 billion is their limit

16
00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.400
All the families in the province that can raise so much money

17
00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:40.800
Why don't we reach an agreement?

18
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.166
Even if other small consortia unite

19
00:00:43.166 --> 00:00:44.700
It is impossible to make such a large

20
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.100
That's a lot of money.
