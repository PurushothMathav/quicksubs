00:00:01.133 --> 00:00:04.600
The first consortium of Rongdu, the review of the new traitors of the Shen family

2
00:00:04.866 --> 00:00:07.100
Future heir to Xingyao Group

3
00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:09.533
I heard that as long as there is extortion

4
00:00:09.533 --> 00:00:12.166
You can have no worries about food and clothing for a lifetime

5
00:00:13.066 --> 00:00:14.133
Who did you hear from?

6
00:00:14.133 --> 00:00:17.500
I was just outside with the kidnappers

7
00:00:18.366 --> 00:00:20.066
Then why were you kidnapped?

8
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.400
Because my dad owes them money

9
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.600
Hey, what are you doing?

10
00:00:26.766 --> 00:00:28.666
Everyone outside said it

11
00:00:28.866 --> 00:00:31.300
As long as I rescue you, the bonus is 100 million

12
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:34.433
I've never seen so much money in my life

13
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.200
The right time, the right place and the right person

14
00:00:36.466 --> 00:00:38.500
I'll take this bonus

15
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.600
Crazy and found out I was screwed

16
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:41.666
It's too late.

17
00:00:41.666 --> 00:00:43.500
Remember that Su You saved you

18
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.833
I'll take this bonus. You love money, I have money.

19
00:00:48.366 --> 00:00:51.200
Isn't our cooperation seamless?

20
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:52.600
But deliberation

21
00:00:52.933 --> 00:00:54.533
What did you give me?

22
00:00:54.533 --> 00:00:57.633
It's not tens of millions, it's not hundreds of millions.

23
00:00:57.966 --> 00:00:59.700
It was hundreds of billions.

24
00:01:02.333 --> 00:01:05.066
Cheers to our first time

25
00:01:11.666 --> 00:01:12.866
Feed leaflet

26
00:01:12.933 --> 00:01:15.100
Come home, grandpa's condition is serious again.

27
00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:15.900
What!

28
00:01:16.166 --> 00:01:18.400
Chongqing and Xingyao Group are now in a special period

29
00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.166
What should I do if my grandfather can't wake up?

30
00:01:20.166 --> 00:01:21.200
How is grandpa?

31
00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.700
From mid-afternoon nap to now

32
00:01:22.733 --> 00:01:24.000
I can't wake up no matter what I call

33
00:01:24.466 --> 00:01:27.066
Strange look, everything is normal

34
00:01:28.266 --> 00:01:32.300
How is it, grandpa, it's okay, it's just that
