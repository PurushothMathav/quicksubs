1
00:00:01.466 --> 00:00:03.933
The Qin family has now started selling stocks

2
00:00:03.933 --> 00:00:04.966
Collected funds

3
00:00:04.966 --> 00:00:07.466
I've sent someone to buy their stock

4
00:00:07.666 --> 00:00:09.866
As soon as the Qin family gets this project

5
00:00:09.866 --> 00:00:12.433
I can devalue the market value of the Qin family consortium

6
00:00:12.533 --> 00:00:14.966
We're just waiting to reap the benefits of the fisherman

7
00:00:14.966 --> 00:00:16.766
If only Jiang's Pharmaceutical

8
00:00:16.766 --> 00:00:19.566
The financial resources of Xingyao Evergreen's three consortia

9
00:00:19.866 --> 00:00:21.500
And it works really well.

10
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.633
And arguably the only way

11
00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:25.066
But what?

12
00:00:25.066 --> 00:00:27.900
You forgot the money I made going out to Lao Jiang

13
00:00:28.666 --> 00:00:30.266
Tell me the truth.

14
00:00:30.333 --> 00:00:33.833
How much money did Lao Jiang make for helping you this time?

15
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.966
Wow, 100 billion.

16
00:00:36.966 --> 00:00:38.766
Or dollars?

17
00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:41.500
$100 billion

18
00:00:41.566 --> 00:00:43.033
Converted to RMB

19
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.800
That's over 600 billion.

20
00:00:45.066 --> 00:00:45.666
This is fast.

21
00:00:45.666 --> 00:00:48.466
That's half the assets of Zombie Pharmaceutical

22
00:00:48.566 --> 00:00:49.366
Oh.

23
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.166
So what you think is

24
00:00:51.166 --> 00:00:52.700
We get the project first

25
00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:54.900
Then lure the whole family to take action

26
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.533
When the time comes, Eli Poqiao

27
00:00:56.533 --> 00:00:57.966
Make a remnant of grace

28
00:00:57.966 --> 00:00:58.966
I'll tell you what.

29
00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.733
In addition to this $100 billion backing

30
00:01:01.733 --> 00:01:04.633
We don't spend a penny on the up-front investment.
