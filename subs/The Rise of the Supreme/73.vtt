1
00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:03.300
It's a trillion-dollar project, at least.

2
00:00:03.366 --> 00:00:06.600
And the upfront investment is at least more than 200 billion

3
00:00:06.666 --> 00:00:08.600
Now we don't have to spend a penny.

4
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:10.166
This is simply for us

5
00:00:10.166 --> 00:00:12.000
There is no risk.

6
00:00:12.333 --> 00:00:14.200
I have already negotiated with the Shubei Zhang family

7
00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:17.200
They're willing to put up 11.5 million.

8
00:00:17.866 --> 00:00:20.866
I thought if I could pull their family over

9
00:00:20.866 --> 00:00:22.100
Pull a few more times

10
00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:23.066
It shouldn't be possible.

11
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.466
I guess

12
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.200
If you can probably come up with 3 million

13
00:00:28.366 --> 00:00:30.433
Let's take care of those families

14
00:00:30.866 --> 00:00:32.033
Let's do something together.

15
00:00:33.933 --> 00:00:36.366
What if they don't want to?

16
00:00:36.366 --> 00:00:39.700
They don't want it. It's an opportunity for them to make money.

17
00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:41.666
If you can't even tell the difference

18
00:00:41.933 --> 00:00:42.833
They deserved it.

19
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.166
This guy is clearly an old fox

20
00:00:49.566 --> 00:00:51.566
If he is a fox

21
00:00:51.566 --> 00:00:53.166
What am I?

22
00:00:53.266 --> 00:00:54.600
Vixen?

23
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:02.466
What are you laughing at?
