00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:01.066
you

2
00:00:02.366 --> 00:00:04.966
What's there to argue with these idiots?

3
00:00:05.066 --> 00:00:06.766
Watch grandpa stop for me first

4
00:00:06.766 --> 00:00:07.700
Please go away

5
00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:09.466
Don't delay my treatment for grandpa

6
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:10.800
cure

7
00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.666
What time is it now? Are you still making trouble here?

8
00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:17.533
Hmph, you trash still don't cure the disease?

9
00:00:17.533 --> 00:00:19.866
Why don't you go to heaven?

10
00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:24.433
Xiaoyi, uncle knows you are worried about grandpa

11
00:00:24.666 --> 00:00:27.200
But now Dr. Zhang is resuscitating inside

12
00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.866
Can't be disturbed casually

13
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.166
You don't go in until you wake up.

14
00:00:31.266 --> 00:00:32.866
He can't cure it

15
00:00:32.966 --> 00:00:35.900
Only I can cure grandpa's illness, you furry boy

16
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.000
You don't measure yourself

17
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.500
Hmph, grandpa is in danger now

18
00:00:41.666 --> 00:00:43.466
Uncle keeps stopping me

19
00:00:43.566 --> 00:00:45.800
Why don't you want grandpa to make anything?

20
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.266
Mr. Chen, I'm so sorry.

21
00:00:47.266 --> 00:00:49.200
The old man is weak and the heart rate is too low

22
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.700
I'm afraid I won't make it through tonight

23
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:52.200
Grandpa

24
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:54.100
intentional

25
00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.133
Just a quack

26
00:00:56.133 --> 00:00:57.866
Why did my grandfather talk like that?

27
00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:59.600
If my grandpa had three long and two short

28
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.100
I will bury you all
