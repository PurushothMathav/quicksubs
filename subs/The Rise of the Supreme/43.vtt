00:00:00.933 --> 00:00:02.700
Late night thank you

2
00:00:02.966 --> 00:00:04.566
For what?

3
00:00:04.566 --> 00:00:06.700
Saving you is also saving me

4
00:00:08.933 --> 00:00:10.333
Without you

5
00:00:10.333 --> 00:00:12.266
I can't even survive a young man

6
00:00:13.366 --> 00:00:15.200
In fact, you still have a lot of time

7
00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.500
To find another eagle limb

8
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:20.166
I used to unite several major families against you

9
00:00:20.166 --> 00:00:22.300
You can actually choose not to save

10
00:00:25.133 --> 00:00:26.200
Don't think so much.

11
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.300
I'm counting on you to recover soon

12
00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.200
Make some zombie medicine and make money for me

13
00:00:31.666 --> 00:00:34.666
Well, it officially starts tomorrow night

14
00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.600
I didn't expect it.

15
00:00:37.766 --> 00:00:39.866
We turned out to be a once-in-a-century suspense

16
00:00:39.866 --> 00:00:41.466
Limbs and pure yang limbs

17
00:00:48.366 --> 00:00:51.866
What's the matter, are you not ready yet?

18
00:00:52.333 --> 00:00:55.033
I just don't think it's fair to you.

19
00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.100
It's not fair.

20
00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.233
And I would also like to

21
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.366
I'd love to.

22
00:01:02.666 --> 00:01:03.966
What does that mean?

23
00:01:04.766 --> 00:01:06.766
How do you need my cooperation?
