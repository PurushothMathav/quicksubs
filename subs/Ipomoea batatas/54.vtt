1
00:00:00.466 --> 00:00:02.166
General general

2
00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:04.000
general

3
00:00:06.066 --> 00:00:07.700
What's your name?

4
00:00:07.866 --> 00:00:10.066
Mercy Young Mercy

5
00:00:13.666 --> 00:00:16.733
It turned out that the person I rescued by the river back then

6
00:00:16.733 --> 00:00:18.433
The current emperor

7
00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.433
It turns out that the person I've been thinking about is you

8
00:00:21.933 --> 00:00:23.566
It's just that God has eyes

9
00:00:25.933 --> 00:00:29.366
Back then, I was alone and cautiously beheaded the leader of the enemy army

10
00:00:29.666 --> 00:00:31.133
It was a covert operation

11
00:00:31.133 --> 00:00:33.466
But I don't know why it was known in advance

12
00:00:33.466 --> 00:00:35.000
Caught in a siege

13
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.900
Several soldiers died with incense

14
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:38.300
I just broke through the siege

15
00:00:38.333 --> 00:00:41.100
Finally fainted by the river due to exhaustion

16
00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:42.833
If you hadn't saved me back then

17
00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.066
I might have really died there

18
00:00:45.066 --> 00:00:47.600
It is the blessing of the concubine to be able to save the emperor

19
00:00:47.733 --> 00:00:49.800
Back then, the concubine sneaked out to play

20
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.066
By the river again

21
00:00:51.066 --> 00:00:52.466
If my parents find out

22
00:00:52.466 --> 00:00:54.166
I have to break the concubine's legs

23
00:00:54.166 --> 00:00:56.566
So the concubine stole someone else to take care of you

24
00:00:56.566 --> 00:00:59.600
I never expected my love for so many years

25
00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:01.100
I paid the wrong one.

26
00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:01.966
That being the case

27
00:01:01.966 --> 00:01:03.566
I will give Miss Yao some silver taels

28
00:01:03.566 --> 00:01:05.966
Let him leave the palace

29
00:01:06.133 --> 00:01:07.133
Anyway.

30
00:01:07.133 --> 00:01:09.533
Miss Yao has the kindness to take care of the emperor

31
00:01:09.533 --> 00:01:10.966
If I drive him away

32
00:01:10.966 --> 00:01:14.266
It is inevitable that the world will feel that the emperor is ruthless

33
00:01:14.366 --> 00:01:15.533
I understand what you're saying.

34
00:01:15.533 --> 00:01:17.500
I remember what you said at that time

35
00:01:17.566 --> 00:01:20.400
He must be here at this moment for some reason

36
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.966
Besides, you are pregnant now.

37
00:01:23.333 --> 00:01:24.800
I'm afraid he's not good for you
