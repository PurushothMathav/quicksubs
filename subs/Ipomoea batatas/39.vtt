00:00:10.733 --> 00:00:13.033
Spring breeze blowing drizzle

2
00:00:13.066 --> 00:00:15.833
Missing my heart like a vine

3
00:00:20.533 --> 00:00:22.900
Yuan'er came so early

4
00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:24.166
But you miss me

5
00:00:24.166 --> 00:00:25.733
Who is he?

6
00:00:25.733 --> 00:00:26.800
He is kind to me

7
00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.966
Once saved me when I was in danger

8
00:00:29.066 --> 00:00:30.400
So your love for me

9
00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.100
It's all because he saved you, right?

10
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:34.566
No wonder Concubine Shu wanted my life as soon as I entered the palace

11
00:00:34.566 --> 00:00:37.166
No wonder I was so scared when I entered the palace

12
00:00:37.166 --> 00:00:39.366
It's no wonder I keep giving birth like this

13
00:00:39.366 --> 00:00:40.400
Everything

14
00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.900
It's all this face that looks like the emperor's savior

15
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:44.300
Is it I admit

16
00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.133
The previous preference for you was indeed because of him

17
00:00:47.133 --> 00:00:49.233
But now I really love you

18
00:00:50.333 --> 00:00:51.800
You don't love me

19
00:00:51.966 --> 00:00:53.466
It's my face.

20
00:00:53.466 --> 00:00:54.733
If not for this face

21
00:00:54.733 --> 00:00:55.800
I am nothing

22
00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.166
I am truly in love with you

23
00:00:57.166 --> 00:00:58.566
How can you believe me?

24
00:00:58.566 --> 00:01:01.000
The emperor actually remembers the person in the painting so much

25
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.400
Why don't you go find him?

26
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:03.600
I have searched

27
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.900
But how can people with the same name and surname fight in the world?

28
00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.466
Like finding a needle in a haystack

29
00:01:08.466 --> 00:01:10.133
But has the emperor ever considered

30
00:01:10.133 --> 00:01:12.966
What would you do if you found him?

31
00:01:12.966 --> 00:01:15.266
It is to keep him Yao Moxi by his side

32
00:01:15.266 --> 00:01:17.533
Kick my double out of the palace, right?

33
00:01:17.533 --> 00:01:19.100
No moon

34
00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:21.666
I will not do anything to disappoint you, Your Majesty

35
00:01:22.066 --> 00:01:23.500
It's not that the concubine doesn't believe it

36
00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.766
But the concubine couldn't accept it for a while

37
00:01:25.766 --> 00:01:29.200
The emperor and his concubines are a little deserted today

38
00:01:31.066 --> 00:01:33.900
The concubine wishes to go to the cold palace to reflect for a few days

39
00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.400
I hope the emperor will approve

40
00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.966
You are innocent and fruitless, why go to the cold palace?

41
00:01:38.966 --> 00:01:40.300
Besides, you are pregnant

42
00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:42.300
Why bother to suffer?

43
00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:44.000
The concubine will take care of herself

44
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.900
If the emperor thinks this is a protest

45
00:01:46.133 --> 00:01:47.300
Punitive
