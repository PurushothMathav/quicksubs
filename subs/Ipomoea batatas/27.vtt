00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:03.733
What's the matter with you, Empress?

2
00:00:03.733 --> 00:00:04.966
Why are you so bothered?

3
00:00:04.966 --> 00:00:06.900
Didn't the emperor save me last time?

4
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:09.733
I want to find a gift to thank him

5
00:00:09.733 --> 00:00:12.033
But he has everything.

6
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.866
After thinking about it for a long time, I finally have a solution today

7
00:00:14.866 --> 00:00:17.166
But you this time

8
00:00:17.166 --> 00:00:19.600
I want to fix a purse with a name for him.

9
00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.900
But after writing for a long time, it has not been good.

10
00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.166
Are you worried?

11
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.500
name

12
00:00:25.366 --> 00:00:26.600
I have an idea.

13
00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:30.900
Good way, Your Majesty

14
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.466
The concubine has an unkind request

15
00:00:32.466 --> 00:00:34.300
I hope you will allow me to say

16
00:00:34.366 --> 00:00:35.433
You also know

17
00:00:35.466 --> 00:00:37.466
The concubine has been practicing calligraphy recently

18
00:00:37.466 --> 00:00:39.266
But never found the rules

19
00:00:39.266 --> 00:00:42.366
I want to get a pair of ink treasures from you and go back to study.

20
00:00:42.533 --> 00:00:45.766
What the hell is this Jiang Yuan up to?

21
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.966
I think your posture for practicing calligraphy is probably wrong.

22
00:00:47.966 --> 00:00:50.433
Come and write to me first.

23
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.866
Stand up straight and use a little force on your wrists

24
00:00:56.866 --> 00:00:57.966
Don't get carried away

25
00:00:57.966 --> 00:00:59.466
Boldness in the chest

26
00:00:59.466 --> 00:01:00.966
To write good words

27
00:01:03.266 --> 00:01:04.466
Thank you Emperor for your guidance

28
00:01:04.466 --> 00:01:06.500
The concubine must study it carefully when she goes back

29
00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:08.000
Then you have to practice hard

30
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.800
I want to accept it.

31
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.500
Do you still want to accept it?

32
00:01:14.933 --> 00:01:15.866
Finally finished

33
00:01:15.866 --> 00:01:18.333
Go back and give this gift some time.

34
00:01:18.333 --> 00:01:19.400
What gift?

35
00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:20.700
Emperor

36
00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.766
Isn't this for me?

37
00:01:23.766 --> 00:01:25.133
It's for the emperor

38
00:01:25.133 --> 00:01:28.266
I just can't fix it well, I want to fix another one.

39
00:01:28.266 --> 00:01:29.366
I'll take it.

40
00:01:29.366 --> 00:01:30.400
So

41
00:01:31.166 --> 00:01:33.600
That pair of ink treasures was specially requested by you

42
00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:34.600
Concubine dare not

43
00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.200
It's just that the concubine wants to surprise the emperor

44
00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.066
To thank the emperor for his previous life-saving grace

45
00:01:40.066 --> 00:01:42.200
Protecting you is a matter of course

46
00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.100
Why thank you

47
00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.466
But you really want to thank me

48
00:01:45.566 --> 00:01:47.033
Then promise me

49
00:01:47.133 --> 00:01:49.266
Your Majesty, you are playing with your concubine again

50
00:01:49.266 --> 00:01:51.700
The concubine has long been a member of the emperor

51
00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.433
How can we promise each other?
