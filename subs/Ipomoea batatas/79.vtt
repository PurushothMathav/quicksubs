00:00:00.666 --> 00:00:01.733
It's rare

2
00:00:01.733 --> 00:00:04.166
It's rare for the two of us to be quiet here for a while

3
00:00:04.166 --> 00:00:07.133
Yes, now I have to take care of that little ancestor every day

4
00:00:07.133 --> 00:00:09.500
The emperor also has to manage the affairs of a country

5
00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:10.666
Of course there's no time

6
00:00:10.666 --> 00:00:11.500
But...

7
00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:13.866
I sent that little ancestor to a private school today

8
00:00:13.866 --> 00:00:15.900
Otherwise, how would we have time to talk here?

9
00:00:16.733 --> 00:00:19.566
Then it's up to the queen to see if we want to have another one

10
00:00:19.866 --> 00:00:20.666
It hurts. What's wrong?

11
00:00:20.666 --> 00:00:22.733
I didn't use any force. How could it hurt so much?

12
00:00:22.733 --> 00:00:25.800
Maybe it's the sequelae of the previous knife

13
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.766
Ah you lied to me

14
00:00:27.766 --> 00:00:29.366
It obviously didn't get stabbed last time.

15
00:00:29.366 --> 00:00:33.666
Hey, why does my head hurt a little?

16
00:00:33.733 --> 00:00:35.133
Why does your head hurt?

17
00:00:35.133 --> 00:00:36.800
Maybe it was caused by poisoning last time.

18
00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.233
After all, the poison of southern Xinjiang

19
00:00:38.333 --> 00:00:39.633
Who knows what the consequences are

20
00:00:40.733 --> 00:00:41.966
You lied to me again.

21
00:00:41.966 --> 00:00:44.366
You didn't take that poison at all

22
00:00:46.966 --> 00:00:47.533
OK.

23
00:00:47.533 --> 00:00:50.966
You two actually tricked this prince into going to school

24
00:00:50.966 --> 00:00:53.100
Don't panic, think about how old I am.

25
00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.333
Now you want me to help you review the memorial

26
00:00:55.333 --> 00:00:58.400
You're not doing your job and you're wasting your time here

27
00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:59.666
the country is the most important

28
00:00:59.666 --> 00:01:01.200
How can children love each other?

29
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.900
I'm all here to pave the way for you in the future

30
00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:04.966
You are not allowed to be lazy!

31
00:01:04.966 --> 00:01:06.966
I can see that you are lazy.

32
00:01:07.866 --> 00:01:10.166
Yes, yes, the prince is right

33
00:01:10.266 --> 00:01:11.800
It's all the emperor's fault

34
00:01:12.266 --> 00:01:16.733
Brother, what will you say after you and your parents?

35
00:01:16.733 --> 00:01:19.100
Just talk to them for a while

36
00:01:19.333 --> 00:01:21.266
Sister, do you want to pick flowers?

37
00:01:21.266 --> 00:01:23.733
Brother, why are you still standing there with you?

38
00:01:23.733 --> 00:01:25.500
Take us to pick flowers

39
00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:26.700
Flowers of the Imperial Garden

40
00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.066
It's almost finished by the two of you

41
00:01:30.366 --> 00:01:31.433
Here we go.
