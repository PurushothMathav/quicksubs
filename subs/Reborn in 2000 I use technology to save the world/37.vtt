00:00:20.733 --> 00:00:21.533
Yaoyao

4
00:00:21.666 --> 00:00:24.000
Although it has been a week since your birthday

5
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.833
But this is the first time my father has celebrated Yaoyao's birthday with him

6
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.833
Yaoyao, are you happy?

7
00:00:33.666 --> 00:00:35.000
Thanks, Dad.

00:00:35.066 --> 00:00:38.100
Yaoyao loves you oops baby I love you too

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:42.300
Okay, Yaoyao, let's cut the cake

00:00:42.366 --> 00:00:44.566
Cut the cake cut the cake pair

11
00:00:44.566 --> 00:00:46.200
Cut the cake

12
00:00:48.933 --> 00:00:50.366
Because you didn't come

13
00:00:50.666 --> 00:00:53.466
Mom will be remarried by me selling the company

14
00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:55.366
Because you didn't come

15
00:00:55.366 --> 00:00:57.466
We will have an earthquake

16
00:00:57.766 --> 00:00:59.500
Mom will die

17
00:01:00.166 --> 00:01:02.800
20 years ago, you cared about yourself

18
00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.000
You will kill your own cow

19
00:01:07.566 --> 00:01:08.566
Breeze

20
00:01:09.166 --> 00:01:12.600
I want you to live forever in regret and loneliness

21
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.633
I Hate You

22
00:01:18.533 --> 00:01:19.333
Yaoyao

23
00:01:19.766 --> 00:01:21.666
I owe you more than 20 years of birthdays

24
00:01:21.866 --> 00:01:23.300
Dad finally made it up

25
00:01:23.933 --> 00:01:26.033
Wang Xu, don't worry.

26
00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.000
I will definitely protect you for the rest of my life

27
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.000
Breeze

28
00:01:34.766 --> 00:01:35.600
To sleep

29
00:01:36.166 --> 00:01:36.966
OK

30
00:01:40.266 --> 00:01:41.233
Qin Feng

31
00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:43.566
Oh, thank you kindly.

32
00:01:45.733 --> 00:01:48.700
This is what I owe you mother and daughter.

33
00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.333
What should Qingfeng do with the next gorgeous phone?

34
00:01:51.333 --> 00:01:53.033
Is it mass-produced and put on the market?

35
00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.166
Your current magnificent equipment and technology

36
00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:57.633
No way to achieve mass production

37
00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:59.400
that

38
00:01:59.866 --> 00:02:00.700
What to do then?

39
00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.266
We can ask the National Academy of Sciences to help.

40
00:02:03.266 --> 00:02:04.800
They have state-of-the-art equipment

41
00:02:05.133 --> 00:02:06.366
National Academy of Sciences

42
00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.266
How can the Academy of Sciences help us?

43
00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:12.966
Did you forget my phone?

44
00:02:12.966 --> 00:02:14.266
How are they made?
