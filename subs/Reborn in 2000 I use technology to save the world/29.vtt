1
00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:03.366
There will be a hurricane in Begonia in 20 minutes

2
00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:04.766
Everyone, get out of here

3
00:00:04.766 --> 00:00:06.933
Although such a coincidental begonia is by the sea

4
00:00:06.933 --> 00:00:09.133
But there hasn't been a hurricane in all these years

5
00:00:09.133 --> 00:00:11.500
Yes, how nice is the weather now?

6
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:13.133
Isn't this nonsense?

7
00:00:13.133 --> 00:00:16.166
Dad, is there really a hurricane?

8
00:00:16.166 --> 00:00:17.733
Did you hear it ahead?

9
00:00:17.733 --> 00:00:20.033
6-Year-olds don't believe you

10
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.300
Yaoyao, we have to trust Dad

11
00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.066
Crazy Deng Mengxue

12
00:00:24.066 --> 00:00:26.900
Do you really believe this shit can predict hurricanes?

13
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.600
So you don't believe in anything.

14
00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:29.866
I don't believe you

15
00:00:29.866 --> 00:00:32.166
Just hold a broken phone and predict a hurricane

16
00:00:32.166 --> 00:00:35.000
What else to predict for a hurricane at Sea City Resort?

17
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.500
What's even more ridiculous is

18
00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.600
He also predicted a hurricane in 20 minutes

19
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:40.733
Hahaha

20
00:00:40.733 --> 00:00:43.366
Qingfeng, do you think you are a great prophet?

21
00:00:43.366 --> 00:00:46.966
Why are you so anxious to get slapped in the face after 20 minutes?

22
00:00:46.966 --> 00:00:50.366
The mobile phone under the breeze collects global satellite data

23
00:00:50.366 --> 00:00:52.366
To achieve 70% accuracy

24
00:00:52.366 --> 00:00:53.800
How could we possibly do that?

25
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.400
Yes, Mr. Qin

26
00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.100
Even if your phone

27
00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.766
He doesn't have the ability to predict natural disasters

28
00:00:58.766 --> 00:01:00.300
We'll support you too, right?

29
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.900
Your phone is enough to make a gorgeous screwdriver

30
00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:04.766
There's really no need to rely on anything else.

31
00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.200
So you think I'm kidding?

32
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.300
Tmall, you have to wait.

33
00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.800
Does it take 20 minutes to get slapped in the face to stop?

34
00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.600
Oops, it's useless to say more

35
00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.666
Since predictions of natural disasters are false

36
00:01:15.666 --> 00:01:17.133
That proves you lost the game

37
00:01:17.133 --> 00:01:18.400
despise the breeze

38
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.700
Hurry up and sell the gorgeous mobile phone to Hu Shao

39
00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.600
You mercenary fools

40
00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.933
There's a hurricane here in 15 minutes

41
00:01:28.933 --> 00:01:30.500
Think about it then

42
00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:31.600
How do you survive?

43
00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:35.333
One step forward was pierced by me before being hit by the hurricane

44
00:01:35.333 --> 00:01:36.466
Do you want to escape?

45
00:01:36.466 --> 00:01:39.433
I'm going to give your dad's to the vault today
