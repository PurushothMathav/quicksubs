00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:02.133
Crazy this kid is completely crazy

2
00:00:02.133 --> 00:00:03.333
You're ashamed of yourself

3
00:00:03.333 --> 00:00:05.100
Why smear our return to the country?

4
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.266
Qingfeng is bound to lose

5
00:00:07.266 --> 00:00:09.533
The existing technology in China

6
00:00:09.533 --> 00:00:11.766
Which phone can compare to Chapo?

7
00:00:11.966 --> 00:00:13.400
How dare you say yes?

8
00:00:13.666 --> 00:00:16.566
Call the police, call the police, and take this bastard away from me

9
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:19.700
Envelope you are so disappointing

10
00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:21.600
We Divorce Yaoyao

11
00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:23.866
And Yaoyao

12
00:00:24.166 --> 00:00:26.600
From now on, I will let him cut ties with you

13
00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.900
You will never see him divorced again in your life

14
00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.400
How about a divorce?

15
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.566
Looking for a divorce agreement

16
00:00:34.566 --> 00:00:37.200
Let this trash sign the divorce papers

17
00:00:40.333 --> 00:00:41.733
Mengxue, don't worry.

18
00:00:41.733 --> 00:00:43.233
We will never lose

19
00:00:43.366 --> 00:00:45.533
Wu Tianyi, I'll ask you then.

20
00:00:45.533 --> 00:00:46.866
What if you lose?

21
00:00:46.866 --> 00:00:48.066
Hahahaha

22
00:00:48.066 --> 00:00:51.966
I will say Qingfeng, aren't you mentally ill?

23
00:00:51.966 --> 00:00:53.800
I represent Sharp

24
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.766
The leading industry in the island country

25
00:00:56.766 --> 00:00:59.166
Even the world is always top

26
00:00:59.566 --> 00:01:00.933
I ask what if you lose

27
00:01:00.933 --> 00:01:02.300
If I lose

28
00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:03.966
I kneel down and apologize to you

29
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.566
And compensate you 20 million

30
00:01:05.566 --> 00:01:08.700
And I will release the news publicly

31
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.166
It is said that the top-level enterprises in the island country are not as good as Huaguo

32
00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:15.033
Well, you heard me.

33
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.000
Did you hear the comments?

34
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.166
Come on up now

35
00:01:18.166 --> 00:01:19.066
Wordy

36
00:01:19.066 --> 00:01:20.900
Yeah, when it comes to gambling

37
00:01:20.933 --> 00:01:22.600
What's the point of saying that?

38
00:01:22.966 --> 00:01:23.800
bully

39
00:01:24.566 --> 00:01:25.633
I Hate You

40
00:01:26.466 --> 00:01:27.466
Wait a minute.

41
00:01:28.133 --> 00:01:28.933

42
00:01:29.466 --> 00:01:31.900
Sign the divorce papers

43
00:01:33.166 --> 00:01:34.333
If I lose

44
00:01:34.333 --> 00:01:35.500
I will naturally owe

45
00:01:35.533 --> 00:01:38.266
Everything I said before will be fulfilled one by one

46
00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:39.700
But before that

47
00:01:39.766 --> 00:01:41.433
Never owe a word

48
00:02:05.566 --> 00:02:07.966
Ladies and gentlemen, this phone

49
00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.300
Will upend your perception
