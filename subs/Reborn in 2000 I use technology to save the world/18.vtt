00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:02.966
Qin Feng, can you stop bragging about being gorgeous?

2
00:00:02.966 --> 00:00:03.866
When will there be a supplement?

3
00:00:03.866 --> 00:00:05.300
More advanced mobile phone materials

4
00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:06.866
Can you please stop embarrassing me?

5
00:00:06.866 --> 00:00:08.566
Moxie, trust me.

6
00:00:08.566 --> 00:00:10.366
I really developed the latest cell phone

7
00:00:10.366 --> 00:00:12.000
Enough Qin Feng

8
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.400
Don't embarrass me anymore

9
00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:14.500
Do you see it?

10
00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:17.633
This kid is so cowardly that he doesn't even have the courage to take the stage

11
00:00:17.866 --> 00:00:19.466
Shameful stuff

12
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.000
Qin Peng tells you the truth

13
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.400
Even if you develop a new material that surpasses Sharp

14
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:30.300
It didn't work either

15
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.066
Because Sharp's phone is still included.

16
00:00:32.066 --> 00:00:34.466
A game with Tetris

17
00:00:34.466 --> 00:00:37.166
Do you have one? That's the cool thing about guided tours?

18
00:00:37.166 --> 00:00:38.133
Not only superior technology

19
00:00:38.133 --> 00:00:40.300
And have a super innovative thinking

20
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:41.700
A Tetris

21
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.100
I can benefit from you like this

22
00:00:43.166 --> 00:00:44.166
I told you the truth

23
00:00:44.166 --> 00:00:45.333
This phone I developed

24
00:00:45.333 --> 00:00:46.866
Not only can you play Tetris

25
00:00:46.866 --> 00:00:48.900
You can even play Red Alert.

26
00:00:49.133 --> 00:00:50.300
StarCraft

27
00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.300
And of course that's what the game does.

28
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.266
It's not just this phone I developed.

29
00:00:54.266 --> 00:00:55.533
It's just not worth mentioning.

30
00:00:55.533 --> 00:00:57.700
Because of this phone I developed

31
00:00:57.733 --> 00:01:00.400
The intelligent end point across the ages

32
00:01:00.666 --> 00:01:03.566
Qingfeng, can you stop talking nonsense?

33
00:01:03.566 --> 00:01:05.166
They're all computer games.

34
00:01:05.166 --> 00:01:06.700
How could he have put it in his phone?

35
00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.866
Hahaha, even his wife doesn't believe him.

36
00:01:09.866 --> 00:01:12.966
Qingfeng, are you bragging now without drafting?

37
00:01:12.966 --> 00:01:14.933
Just you trash

38
00:01:14.933 --> 00:01:15.966
I'm afraid you don't know

39
00:01:15.966 --> 00:01:18.466
How much memory does a large-scale game take up on a mobile phone?

40
00:01:18.466 --> 00:01:21.166
Hey, this kid is just talking nonsense

41
00:01:21.166 --> 00:01:22.800
I thought he had two brushes

42
00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.500
I didn't expect him to be a complete liar

43
00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.000
If you really develop Qingfeng

44
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.666
What's new?

45
00:01:29.866 --> 00:01:31.266
You can show it on stage.

46
00:01:31.266 --> 00:01:33.300
Who doesn't have the ability to brag?

47
00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:37.700
And I said I built a spaceship. Okay.

48
00:01:37.766 --> 00:01:40.400
If you want to see it, I'll show it to you.
