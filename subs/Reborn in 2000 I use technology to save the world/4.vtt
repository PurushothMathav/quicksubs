00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:02.200
Breeze, I am your wife

2
00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:03.666
You bet on me?

3
00:00:03.666 --> 00:00:05.733
Bad dad stinky dad

4
00:00:05.733 --> 00:00:07.466
Hmph Meng Xu Yaoyao

5
00:00:07.466 --> 00:00:08.933
I promise to win 100%

6
00:00:08.933 --> 00:00:11.200
Just because you are a piece of trash still want to win

7
00:00:11.333 --> 00:00:12.766
Daydreaming

8
00:00:12.866 --> 00:00:15.033
Mom, let him gamble

9
00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.600
Isn't losing the best of both worlds?

10
00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.166
Yes, yes, yes.

11
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.866
I lost, just in time to marry Mengxue to Hu Shaohum

12
00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.200
Mengxue got all the state expenses

13
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.200
You are still mine after all

14
00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:29.866
Go away hum

15
00:00:30.266 --> 00:00:32.866
I'd like to see how hard you work

16
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.233
You'll find out soon enough.

17
00:00:36.933 --> 00:00:39.366
Now the world of electronics is not that new.

18
00:00:39.466 --> 00:00:40.766
But at the price of the invention

19
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:41.966
Made earthquake

20
00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:44.633
So issue an early warning two minutes in advance

21
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.466
Enough time to avoid risk

22
00:00:47.733 --> 00:00:49.966
In my last life, I still soaked this price.

23
00:00:49.966 --> 00:00:51.033
Built into the phone

24
00:00:51.366 --> 00:00:53.400
Made a double-click that can predict natural disasters around the world

25
00:00:53.933 --> 00:00:55.300
It will definitely work this time.

26
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.366
The seismometer is ready.

27
00:01:00.366 --> 00:01:01.466
What is this thing?

28
00:01:01.466 --> 00:01:05.066
Dad, this seismometer is so ugly!

29
00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.933
What the hell did this kid make?

30
00:01:07.933 --> 00:01:09.833
I really thought I was a scientist

31
00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.266
Breeze, let's not talk about earthquakes

32
00:01:13.533 --> 00:01:15.400
With this crap you made

33
00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:16.800
We want to predict earthquakes.

34
00:01:16.933 --> 00:01:18.666
What a joke.

35
00:01:18.666 --> 00:01:19.966
Haha breeze

36
00:01:20.166 --> 00:01:22.366
Everyone here today is highly refined

37
00:01:22.366 --> 00:01:23.800
At the helm of the company

38
00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:25.533
You make this crap

39
00:01:25.533 --> 00:01:26.966
Do you want to embarrass the Duan family?

40
00:01:26.966 --> 00:01:28.400
Just your broken parts

41
00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.200
Can't even achieve the effect of the roar of the alarm?

42
00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:32.933
Fucking predict shit

43
00:01:32.933 --> 00:01:36.200
No, I see you won today

44
00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.566
When you marry my sister

45
00:01:37.666 --> 00:01:39.600
But don't forget to marry me

46
00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.033
Don't worry.

47
00:01:41.966 --> 00:01:44.300
Breeze, is this okay?

48
00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:45.100
Don't worry.

49
00:01:45.866 --> 00:01:47.900
There will be an earthquake here in 25 minutes

50
00:01:48.066 --> 00:01:50.833
And an earthquake warning will be issued 2 minutes in advance

51
00:01:51.966 --> 00:01:53.700
No, the earthquake may have been advanced.

52
00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:54.266
Let's go quickly

53
00:01:54.266 --> 00:01:55.966
It's so easy to stop and go

54
00:01:55.966 --> 00:01:58.333
Didn't you hear that the earthquake was warned?

55
00:01:58.333 --> 00:01:59.100
Go away

56
00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.766
Breeze, do you think you made such a junk?

57
00:02:01.766 --> 00:02:03.100
Everyone can believe

58
00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:04.200
He can't just

59
00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.600
To achieve the effect of roaring?

60
00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:06.633
What to pack

61
00:02:06.666 --> 00:02:07.500
That is.

62
00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.533
I don't think you can prove that the earthquake is coming.

63
00:02:09.533 --> 00:02:11.866
Take the opportunity to take them away or make a travel bet

64
00:02:11.866 --> 00:02:12.600
Stop him for me

65
00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.566
Hu Tianyi, if you want to die, I will not stop you

66
00:02:14.566 --> 00:02:16.233
But don't stop me, hurry up and leave

67
00:02:16.333 --> 00:02:18.866
I think it's been two minutes since the earthquake.

68
00:02:23.966 --> 00:02:25.100
Earthquake
