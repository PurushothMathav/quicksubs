1
00:00:01.133 --> 00:00:02.300
I have an opinion

2
00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:05.266
Dad?

3
00:00:10.133 --> 00:00:12.633
Qin Feng, why are you here?

4
00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:14.533
You can come, why can't I come?

5
00:00:14.533 --> 00:00:16.133
Qingfeng, what are you doing here?

6
00:00:16.133 --> 00:00:18.566
I'm here to represent Gorgeous in the technology selection

7
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.400
Qingfeng, you flying dance dare to participate in the technology selection

8
00:00:22.466 --> 00:00:24.700
Let's not be deceived by him

9
00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:26.700
He is our useless son-in-law

10
00:00:26.766 --> 00:00:28.066
Edible and lazy

11
00:00:28.066 --> 00:00:30.966
And locked himself in the house for years without going out

12
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.433
What technology does he know?

13
00:00:32.666 --> 00:00:35.466
Unexpectedly, Duan Mengxue's husband turned out to be a waste

14
00:00:35.466 --> 00:00:37.300
No wonder it's gorgeous and down-to-earth.

15
00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.466
Even the CEO has such a poor eye for men

16
00:00:39.466 --> 00:00:40.866
What good products can be made?

17
00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:42.700
Jin Feng, don't talk nonsense

18
00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:44.166
This is not a place for you to mess around

19
00:00:44.166 --> 00:00:47.866
Even my mother is not a match for guiding mobile phones

20
00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:51.333
The father who can only hide out has no way to Mo Xue

21
00:00:51.333 --> 00:00:52.100
You believe me.

22
00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.233
I have developed the latest smartphones

23
00:00:54.333 --> 00:00:55.800
You will definitely get the first place.

24
00:00:55.966 --> 00:00:57.400
Latest mobile phone

25
00:00:57.466 --> 00:01:00.133
Just because you trash still want to get first place

26
00:01:00.133 --> 00:01:02.800
You know this Sharp phone in my hand

27
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.400
How high-end is it?

28
00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:05.400
Just trash

29
00:01:05.766 --> 00:01:07.833
Garbage Qin Fang

30
00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:11.266
The case of my lower general phone can smash walnuts.

31
00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.000
Smash walnuts, you know?

32
00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.700
This is the newly developed integrated material in the island country

33
00:01:24.766 --> 00:01:25.800
solid

34
00:01:26.933 --> 00:01:29.066
Humming walnuts

35
00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.166
It's ridiculous

36
00:01:30.166 --> 00:01:33.400
This phone I developed can even smash diamonds

37
00:01:34.733 --> 00:01:35.500
In comparison

38
00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.800
Your phone is a fighter in the trash

39
00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:40.266
Even diamonds can be smashed

40
00:01:40.266 --> 00:01:41.800
This kid is too crazy

41
00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:42.666
This diamond?

42
00:01:42.666 --> 00:01:44.666
But the hardest in nature

43
00:01:44.666 --> 00:01:45.700
Buffalo

44
00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.566
Gorgeous mobile phones have been dedicated to the development of new materials

45
00:01:48.566 --> 00:01:51.400
Did they really develop a better phone than the next one?

46
00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:52.466
And your phone materials

47
00:01:52.466 --> 00:01:54.033
It's not impossible.

48
00:01:54.166 --> 00:01:55.100
How is that possible?

49
00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.900
No matter how gorgeous it is, it can't compare to Sharp in the island country.

50
00:01:57.933 --> 00:01:59.066
That is.

51
00:01:59.133 --> 00:02:01.833
Can we still not know the gorgeous strength?

52
00:02:01.866 --> 00:02:04.100
Jin Feng, can you stop talking nonsense?

53
00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:05.366
And smashed diamonds

54
00:02:05.366 --> 00:02:06.933
You are not afraid that the wind will hit you

55
00:02:06.933 --> 00:02:08.866
Tongue you are so capable

56
00:02:09.566 --> 00:02:11.900
Show it on stage

57
00:02:11.933 --> 00:02:13.166
As you wish
