00:00:00.533 --> 00:00:01.800
Hahahaha

2
00:00:02.066 --> 00:00:03.600
16 languages

3
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:04.966
It's ridiculous

4
00:00:04.966 --> 00:00:08.266
Qin Feng's wife is such an advanced robot

5
00:00:08.266 --> 00:00:10.233
Only two languages.

6
00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.300
You can master 16 kinds of second-hand splashing models.

7
00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:14.100
Who are you asking?

8
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:17.000
You are a robot

9
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.766
How is it possible to communicate skillfully with people?

10
00:00:18.966 --> 00:00:19.866
Can't do it

11
00:00:19.866 --> 00:00:20.900
How could he possibly do it?

12
00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:21.700
police

13
00:00:21.933 --> 00:00:24.566
You're not very good at developing robots.

14
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.800
The bragging skills are first-class.

15
00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:29.566
No wonder your country's technology is so backward.

16
00:00:29.566 --> 00:00:32.766
It's all because of people like you.

17
00:00:33.566 --> 00:00:34.766
This wicked man is trapped

18
00:00:35.133 --> 00:00:37.300
After passing the people's livelihood, it is corrupted by such people

19
00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:38.666
And what's even worse is this.

20
00:00:39.066 --> 00:00:40.200
This brat

21
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.100
Let this second-hand model

22
00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:43.533
Walk in through that door

23
00:00:43.533 --> 00:00:45.233
You really think we're fools.

24
00:00:45.266 --> 00:00:47.200
Thought they could scare us

25
00:00:47.366 --> 00:00:49.400
It's just programmed.

26
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:50.666
Did you see that?

27
00:00:50.666 --> 00:00:51.866
After the investment

28
00:00:51.866 --> 00:00:54.733
And the model never does anything.

29
00:00:54.733 --> 00:00:57.366
Isn't it the set procedure?

30
00:00:57.366 --> 00:01:01.500
If you have the ability, you can make this robot do a dance?

31
00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:02.633
How hard is it?

32
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:04.633
Xiaoxue

33
00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:07.266
Forget it, brother-in-law

34
00:01:07.366 --> 00:01:09.700
How can a robot dance?

35
00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.100
It cannot be designed by others.

36
00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.100
We have to make it work.

37
00:01:14.133 --> 00:01:15.766
Will you stop bragging?

38
00:01:15.933 --> 00:01:18.200
Just get out of here, get out of here

39
00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.566
Get out get out get out

40
00:01:21.166 --> 00:01:23.433
Get out get out get out

41
00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.833
Get out, get out, get out, get out

42
00:01:26.933 --> 00:01:28.066
Xiaoxue

43
00:01:28.533 --> 00:01:31.100
Can you stand them telling us to get out?

44
00:01:31.166 --> 00:01:33.200
Master, you finally let me speak

45
00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.200
I can't stand this group of people for a long time

46
00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.900
Just this crap or artificial intelligence

47
00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:39.866
I think it's artificial mental retardation

48
00:01:48.266 --> 00:01:51.866
Ahhhh!
