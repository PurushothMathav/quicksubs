1
00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:01.600
And he said yes.

2
00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:03.700
Mr. Yasumoto and the others would really agree

3
00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:05.033
This this

4
00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.000
I, I, I heard right?

5
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.400
How is that possible?

6
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:10.666
How could Mr. Okamoto agree?

7
00:00:11.066 --> 00:00:13.866
Island countries have been mocking China's scientific and technological circles over the years

8
00:00:13.866 --> 00:00:15.666
This village can bend over

9
00:00:15.666 --> 00:00:16.866
Hahahaha

10
00:00:16.866 --> 00:00:19.433
So proud

11
00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:20.866
The migrant worker loses

12
00:00:20.866 --> 00:00:22.400
The migrant worker loses

13
00:00:22.466 --> 00:00:23.666
Mr. Qin

14
00:00:23.666 --> 00:00:25.733
I'll see my teacher soon

15
00:00:25.733 --> 00:00:27.266
Mr. Kogun Saburo

16
00:00:27.266 --> 00:00:30.333
Even if I were to tell him the truth

17
00:00:30.333 --> 00:00:32.133
Please don't experiment, of course.

18
00:00:32.133 --> 00:00:33.800
I'm not from your island country

19
00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.400
Arik is dead

20
00:00:38.466 --> 00:00:39.633
Why Mr. Ichiro

21
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.500
Breeze, wait for me

22
00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.900
Didn't you just develop a broken mobile phone?

23
00:00:45.966 --> 00:00:47.700
You can do whatever you want.

24
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.500
Qingfeng's business is not over today, mother.

25
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.233
Let's go

26
00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.500
Striker, do you really plan to cooperate with the islanders?

27
00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.166
Qianfeng, this phone you developed

28
00:00:58.166 --> 00:01:00.266
Definitely the most advanced in the world

29
00:01:00.266 --> 00:01:01.900
Never cooperate with the islanders

30
00:01:01.966 --> 00:01:03.100
Otherwise they learn

31
00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.700
Are you going to shit and pee on our Chinese people?

32
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:06.700
Yeah, yeah.

33
00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:07.766
Don't worry.

34
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.500
Now the islanders are arrogant

35
00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.533
I won't believe what Gangben says at all

36
00:01:11.533 --> 00:01:13.166
I will not make such a statement

37
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.133
Besides, even if we want to cooperate

38
00:01:15.133 --> 00:01:17.166
We also need to cooperate with our own company, right?

39
00:01:17.166 --> 00:01:18.933
We should cooperate with our local enterprises in China.

40
00:01:18.933 --> 00:01:21.066
That's Mr. Qin, Miss Zhao

41
00:01:21.066 --> 00:01:22.533
We just talked about cooperation.

42
00:01:22.533 --> 00:01:24.266
You think about it again hey

43
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:25.700
Sir, sir.

44
00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.466
Sir, we cooperate and follow me
