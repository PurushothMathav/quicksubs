00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:02.333
Dean, I remember you seem to have a student

2
00:00:02.333 --> 00:00:04.066
He is the chief executive of Tiancheng

3
00:00:04.066 --> 00:00:05.366
Is it oh yes

4
00:00:05.366 --> 00:00:06.500
How could I have forgotten him?

5
00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:07.666
Quickly call up my address book

6
00:00:07.666 --> 00:00:08.900
Call him now

7
00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:10.400
Ok what

8
00:00:10.533 --> 00:00:12.033
I had a big earthquake

9
00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:13.866
Yeah, 17 minutes ago.

10
00:00:13.866 --> 00:00:16.033
The seismometer issues an alarm in 15 minutes

11
00:00:16.333 --> 00:00:18.666
There was an earthquake 17 minutes ago

12
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.433
Exactly 2 minutes time difference

13
00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:23.466
Can this seismometer really predict earthquakes?

14
00:00:23.533 --> 00:00:24.900
How is that possible?

15
00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.000
How can this crap predict earthquakes?

16
00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.500
That's simply not possible.

17
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.466
Will there be an earthquake in the Tiancheng team?

18
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:31.500
What do you do?

19
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:32.866
Is it really going to happen?

20
00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:35.533
The Chief Executive has seven minutes left before the earthquake

21
00:00:35.533 --> 00:00:37.133
Is it too late for us to evacuate now?

22
00:00:37.133 --> 00:00:37.800
Tianfeng

23
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.266
You just happened to be hit by an earthquake

24
00:00:40.266 --> 00:00:42.733
How dare you give birth to the mysterious chief executive

25
00:00:42.733 --> 00:00:45.066
Chief Executive, we have more than 500,000 people in Tiancheng

26
00:00:45.066 --> 00:00:46.966
If he picks up the bottle and evacuates with one word

27
00:00:46.966 --> 00:00:48.466
How much would that cost?

28
00:00:48.466 --> 00:00:49.500
Don't worry, Chief Executive

29
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.666
There will never be an earthquake in our Tiancheng

30
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.766
Ah, why did the teacher call me?

31
00:00:57.366 --> 00:00:59.733
Teacher, why did you call me?

32
00:00:59.733 --> 00:01:00.800
I got the message.

33
00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.866
A massive earthquake is possible in Libra

34
00:01:02.866 --> 00:01:04.200
Hurry up and say 300 surnames

35
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:05.266
true or false?

36
00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:06.900
Am I kidding you?

37
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:07.800
Hey, in addition

38
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.466
Qin Feng is the chief engineer of our Academy of Sciences

39
00:01:10.466 --> 00:01:11.933
Make sure he's safe

40
00:01:11.933 --> 00:01:12.733
Yes

41
00:01:13.466 --> 00:01:17.233
Police, you are me. It doesn't matter who I am

42
00:01:17.266 --> 00:01:18.833
Get everyone out of here

43
00:01:18.933 --> 00:01:19.600
That's right.

44
00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.300
Evacuate everyone to a place like the Libra Mine

45
00:01:22.366 --> 00:01:23.400
Open place to go

46
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.833
Hurry up

47
00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.266
Cancel the exchange fee immediately

48
00:01:27.266 --> 00:01:30.133
You are responsible for evacuating people to Tiancheng Square

49
00:01:30.133 --> 00:01:31.000
Not a breakup

50
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.266
Do you really believe there will be an earthquake?

51
00:01:33.266 --> 00:01:34.366
This is an order.

52
00:01:34.566 --> 00:01:36.200
Activate emergency plans immediately

53
00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.566
Evacuate people on the spot

54
00:01:37.666 --> 00:01:38.466
Yes

55
00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.066
If there is a real earthquake in Luo Theater

56
00:01:42.133 --> 00:01:43.400
Don't do it
