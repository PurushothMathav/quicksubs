00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:00.866
Yes

2
00:00:00.866 --> 00:00:03.700
Gorgeous mobile phones may be on top of the world

3
00:00:03.733 --> 00:00:05.866
Yeah, yeah, mom.

4
00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:08.533
Is the gorgeous phone saved?

5
00:00:08.533 --> 00:00:09.500
Hmm breeze

6
00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:10.200
I didn't expect you to

7
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.033
Really developed such an advanced mobile phone

8
00:00:12.066 --> 00:00:13.266
I really blamed you.

9
00:00:13.266 --> 00:00:14.366
What are you talking about?

10
00:00:14.366 --> 00:00:16.100
Isn't it just a broken screen?

11
00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:19.700
Why are you so excited?

12
00:00:19.766 --> 00:00:21.766
In fact, this phone is not only anti-drop

13
00:00:21.766 --> 00:00:23.466
And waterproof and dustproof

14
00:00:23.466 --> 00:00:26.700
Three-proof mobile phone for short, hey, got it, got it

15
00:00:26.733 --> 00:00:28.400
Dust-proof and drop-proof

16
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.533
It's still waterproof, are you talking nonsense?

17
00:00:31.533 --> 00:00:32.700
That is.

18
00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.133
This phone is full of electron source gas slurry

19
00:00:35.133 --> 00:00:36.533
It will be wasted in contact with water

20
00:00:36.533 --> 00:00:37.933
It's just basic common sense.

21
00:00:37.933 --> 00:00:41.033
Qingfeng, can you have some basic common sense?

22
00:00:41.133 --> 00:00:43.166
I see you are bragging

23
00:00:43.166 --> 00:00:45.100
Yeah, water's all over the place.

24
00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:46.466
How can it be waterproof?

25
00:00:46.466 --> 00:00:47.600
Liar again

26
00:00:47.766 --> 00:00:48.366
Qin Peng

27
00:00:48.366 --> 00:00:50.600
The phone you developed is good enough.

28
00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.100
There's no need to talk about the impractical. That's right.

29
00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.866
Just based on the material and system of this phone

30
00:00:54.866 --> 00:00:56.866
It's enough to win the first prize in this technology selection

31
00:00:56.866 --> 00:00:58.500
Hey, don't stop him.

32
00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.466
Didn't he say his phone is waterproof?

33
00:01:00.466 --> 00:01:01.466
Why don't you try it?

34
00:01:01.466 --> 00:01:04.500
Try it, Hu Tianyi, are you finished?

35
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.333
You just want to see Qin Feng eat turtles

36
00:01:06.333 --> 00:01:07.600
Don't wrong good people

37
00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.533
He said it himself.

38
00:01:09.533 --> 00:01:11.000
I didn't say it.

39
00:01:11.266 --> 00:01:12.266
Keep trying.

40
00:01:12.333 --> 00:01:14.866
Yeah, we just want to open our eyes

41
00:01:14.866 --> 00:01:16.200
It's not that I don't believe

42
00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:18.800
Will you throw in the towel as long as I show it?

43
00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.200
Yeah, I am.

44
00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.866
As long as your phone can talk in water

45
00:01:22.866 --> 00:01:24.366
I admit defeat

46
00:01:24.366 --> 00:01:26.766
Get me a fish tank full of water
