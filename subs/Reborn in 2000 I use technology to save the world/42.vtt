00:00:00.933 --> 00:00:03.833
Why haven't mom and dad come yet?

2
00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.500
Don't worry, mom has notified dad.

3
00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:08.833
Dad should be here soon.

4
00:00:09.066 --> 00:00:12.300
Hahahahaha

5
00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:14.866
Why are you here?

6
00:00:14.866 --> 00:00:16.200
I am your mother

7
00:00:16.333 --> 00:00:17.733
Why can't I come?

8
00:00:17.733 --> 00:00:20.300
It was when it was founded Gorgeous

9
00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:21.866
We have also contributed

10
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.166
You have already lost the previous mobile phone bet.

11
00:00:24.166 --> 00:00:25.200
What are you doing here?

12
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:26.100
Not back here

13
00:00:26.266 --> 00:00:27.366
Please leave

14
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:28.200
What!

15
00:00:28.566 --> 00:00:31.033
Our island nation leads the world in technology

16
00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:32.433
How could you lose?

17
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.633
What is a broken phone?

18
00:00:35.866 --> 00:00:39.433
Mr. Gangamoto brought high technology this time

19
00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.166
Hey, Mr. Gangamoto

20
00:00:41.166 --> 00:00:44.166
You'll have someone lift him up to open their eyes

21
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.300
Time to come up

22
00:01:03.766 --> 00:01:05.100
This is not fat blue

23
00:01:05.166 --> 00:01:06.566
This is the new technology of the island nation

24
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.000
Isn't this just a internet user?

25
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:09.833
shut up

26
00:01:10.333 --> 00:01:13.833
This is the latest intelligent machine developed by the island country

27
00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:16.866
Nice robot

28
00:01:17.066 --> 00:01:20.666
This robot can understand human commands

29
00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.766
You can also make a repeater.

30
00:01:22.766 --> 00:01:26.266
Singing can also teach children to learn foreign languages

31
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.833
And here's the thing.

32
00:01:27.933 --> 00:01:30.266
He can also understand human commands

33
00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.766
Fatty Blue says hello to everyone

34
00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.200
Snoring frog Vadasi Dora a dream low speed

35
00:01:37.333 --> 00:01:38.966
Can you really take orders from people?

36
00:01:38.966 --> 00:01:39.933
This is too high-end

37
00:01:39.933 --> 00:01:42.000
As expected of the high technology of the island country

38
00:01:42.766 --> 00:01:46.166
Mom, are they here to smash the scene?

39
00:01:46.266 --> 00:01:48.933
Little friend, didn't your father say

40
00:01:48.933 --> 00:01:50.966
Our island country's technology is not as good as yours

41
00:01:50.966 --> 00:01:51.966
Posted

42
00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.566
Do you have such a high-end robot?

43
00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.033
Just this trash

44
00:01:57.066 --> 00:01:59.633
I'm embarrassed to take it out and embarrass it
