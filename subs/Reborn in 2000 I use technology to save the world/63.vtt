00:00:00.566 --> 00:00:01.366
Uh-huh.

2
00:00:01.966 --> 00:00:02.766
Ah!

3
00:00:04.166 --> 00:00:04.966
How come?

4
00:00:04.966 --> 00:00:05.866
Do you hear me?

5
00:00:06.066 --> 00:00:07.366
I don't want to die!

6
00:00:07.866 --> 00:00:09.000
Don't panic

7
00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:12.600
It was just an earthquake caused by a volcanic eruption in the island country

8
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.833
It doesn't have much impact on us.

9
00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:17.000
Wow! The earthquake stopped.

10
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.866
What's going on?

11
00:00:18.866 --> 00:00:21.833
Did the volcano in the island country really erupt?

12
00:00:22.166 --> 00:00:23.200
That's not possible.

13
00:00:23.466 --> 00:00:25.000
He is a liar

14
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:26.900
He is a liar

15
00:00:26.933 --> 00:00:28.266
He developed the robot.

16
00:00:28.266 --> 00:00:30.266
How is it possible to predict earthquakes?

17
00:00:30.266 --> 00:00:32.900
No, there was indeed an earthquake just now.

18
00:00:32.966 --> 00:00:34.266
And with Qin Feng

19
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.966
And the time predicted by Patriarch Qin

20
00:00:36.966 --> 00:00:38.600
Basically the same

21
00:00:38.766 --> 00:00:40.833
Yeah, about the same.

22
00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:44.800
How accurate!

23
00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.700
Yeah dad won

24
00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:47.733
Xiaoxue

25
00:00:47.733 --> 00:00:49.166
Dad won

26
00:00:49.366 --> 00:00:50.666
But necessary

27
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.900
The money always has to be back to you, right?

28
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.666
Are we really blaming him?

29
00:00:57.566 --> 00:01:00.766
Genius is just a coincidence

30
00:01:00.766 --> 00:01:03.900
Do you really believe in Kim Saburo?

31
00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:05.833
The facts are already in front of you

32
00:01:05.866 --> 00:01:07.466
Is that still relevant?

33
00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.600
What's the world if you don't see it with your own eyes?

34
00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.300
Debon quickly called back to the knife country

35
00:01:14.333 --> 00:01:17.400
I want to personally confirm that the mortals of Saber Country Volcano are safe

36
00:01:28.166 --> 00:01:29.166
Can't get through. Yes.

37
00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:30.566
What's possible?

38
00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:31.966
Why not?

39
00:01:32.066 --> 00:01:33.866
You've had volcanic eruptions.

40
00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.700
Very likely

41
00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.500
Everyone you contacted has died in the fire

42
00:01:37.566 --> 00:01:39.566
So of course the phone doesn't get through

43
00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.833
No fight, no nonsense

44
00:01:45.866 --> 00:01:48.100
Teacher, we fiddle

45
00:01:48.333 --> 00:01:49.833
The volcano did erupt.
