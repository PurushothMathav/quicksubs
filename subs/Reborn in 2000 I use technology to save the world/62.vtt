00:00:07.966 --> 00:00:13.233
Hahahahahahaha

2
00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:17.433
Qingfeng, didn't you say the volcano erupted?

3
00:00:17.733 --> 00:00:19.400
Is it a volcano?

4
00:00:19.533 --> 00:00:20.533
What about eruptions?

5
00:00:20.533 --> 00:00:23.500
Oh, why don't I feel the slightest bit?

6
00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:26.533
Hahaha, you shook it.

7
00:00:26.533 --> 00:00:29.166
Once the volcanic eruption material erupts

8
00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:30.566
Soldiers can cause earthquakes

9
00:00:30.566 --> 00:00:32.866
Even we can feel it

10
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:33.866
Yes!

11
00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:38.366
It turns out that the island nation's volcano did not erupt

12
00:00:38.366 --> 00:00:39.900
Your stupid phone

13
00:00:39.933 --> 00:00:41.966
What rubbish among rubbish

14
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.866
Just the breeze.

15
00:00:43.966 --> 00:00:45.333
Looks like you lost

16
00:00:45.333 --> 00:00:47.200
Why don't you kneel down and apologize?

17
00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:48.466
Kneel down now

18
00:00:48.566 --> 00:00:50.900
What the hell is going on with Qingfeng?

19
00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:52.133
Yes, Chief Teacher Qin

20
00:00:52.133 --> 00:00:53.266
How could this be?

21
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.200
How come?

22
00:00:55.266 --> 00:00:56.900
I'll tell you what happened.

23
00:00:56.966 --> 00:00:57.933
Because this kid

24
00:00:57.933 --> 00:01:00.700
Just a complete liar

25
00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.200
Don't worry.

26
00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.366
The reason why we are now

27
00:01:05.366 --> 00:01:07.066
Didn't feel any movement

28
00:01:07.066 --> 00:01:10.766
Because seismic waves take time to travel

29
00:01:10.933 --> 00:01:12.366
But if everyone

30
00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.300
If you are in a hurry and want to know the result

31
00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:15.100
might as well

32
00:01:15.366 --> 00:01:18.700
Just give your island country a try.

33
00:01:18.733 --> 00:01:21.866
But whether it passes or not is a two-way street.

34
00:01:22.966 --> 00:01:24.633
Well, so far

35
00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.866
You're still handing me the frog?

36
00:01:27.666 --> 00:01:29.266
If you lose, you lose.

37
00:01:29.333 --> 00:01:32.066
You even have this basic moral code

38
00:01:32.066 --> 00:01:33.766
Don't you want to abide by it?

39
00:01:33.766 --> 00:01:35.466
He is a liar

40
00:01:35.466 --> 00:01:37.066
Where does the ethics come from?

41
00:01:37.366 --> 00:01:38.866
Lose and refuse to admit it

42
00:01:38.866 --> 00:01:39.566
Qin Feng

43
00:01:39.566 --> 00:01:42.566
I've never seen you so brazen

44
00:01:42.566 --> 00:01:43.766
People hum

45
00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.800
Because if you don't recognize it, everything will be fine

46
00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.733
Zhang Ben called Gao Guo's friend immediately

47
00:01:50.733 --> 00:01:53.233
I want to see you all today.

48
00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:54.600
Hey

49
00:02:00.133 --> 00:02:05.500
Hahahahahaha
