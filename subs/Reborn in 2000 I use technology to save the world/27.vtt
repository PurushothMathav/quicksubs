00:00:03.533 --> 00:00:05.066
Used used

3
00:00:05.066 --> 00:00:05.666
That's amazing.

4
00:00:05.666 --> 00:00:07.266
Dad is awesome

5
00:00:07.366 --> 00:00:08.333
How is that possible?

6
00:00:08.333 --> 00:00:09.500
Simply unheard of

7
00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:10.266
Never seen

8
00:00:10.266 --> 00:00:12.300
This phone is perfect

9
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.700
To make such a perfect phone

10
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.266
Impossible this trash

11
00:00:16.266 --> 00:00:18.266
How is it possible to create such a mobile phone?

12
00:00:18.733 --> 00:00:19.800
No one else can

13
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.400
It doesn't mean I can't do it either

14
00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.266
If my father were a loser

15
00:00:23.266 --> 00:00:24.900
And what are you?

16
00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:25.400
Hey

17
00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.766
Little girl, who do you think is trash?

18
00:00:27.766 --> 00:00:28.800
Do you still want to fight Yaoyao?

19
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.366
Hey, Duan Mengran

20
00:00:30.466 --> 00:00:32.700
Did you just say you were going to wash your hair upside down?

21
00:00:32.766 --> 00:00:33.700
Water is ready

22
00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.866
Come on, Mr. Qin

23
00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:36.700
Miss Duan

24
00:00:36.733 --> 00:00:38.900
When will our mobile phone be listed?

25
00:00:38.933 --> 00:00:41.100
I can't wait to experience it

26
00:00:41.133 --> 00:00:43.966
It's this phone. Once it hits the market

27
00:00:43.966 --> 00:00:45.366
Absolutely swept the world

28
00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.366
Gorgeous wants to stand at the top of the world's mobile phones

29
00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:49.400
It depends.

30
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.533
When will Mengxue be available for mass production of mobile phones?

31
00:00:51.533 --> 00:00:52.333
Yes

32
00:00:52.866 --> 00:00:55.200
Now the gorgeous funds are relatively tight.

33
00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:56.366
Therefore, Miss Fan

34
00:00:56.366 --> 00:00:57.600
I'm willing to 2 million

35
00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.733
Just to get the qualification to be able to give gorgeous OEM

36
00:00:59.733 --> 00:01:00.566
I 5 million

37
00:01:00.566 --> 00:01:01.900
As long as you can OEM for gorgeous

38
00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:02.900
I don't want program fees

39
00:01:02.966 --> 00:01:04.666
Uh, you just want to learn some skills

40
00:01:04.666 --> 00:01:05.866
I 8 million

41
00:01:05.933 --> 00:01:07.800
I don't pay 10 million, I leave the factory

42
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.266
I give 12 million

43
00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.266
Damn it's just a cell phone

44
00:01:12.266 --> 00:01:13.466
What's there to be proud of?

45
00:01:13.466 --> 00:01:15.266
Hu Shaokai think of a way

46
00:01:15.266 --> 00:01:16.866
We can't let them be arrogant anymore

47
00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:19.766
That's right, his phone is really excellent.

48
00:01:19.766 --> 00:01:20.833
But

49
00:01:21.666 --> 00:01:23.400
It's missing one of its most important functions.

50
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.433
What function is it? Weather forecast.

51
00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.400
The mobile phones we've launched can predict the weather

52
00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.500
And up to 70% accurate

53
00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:32.400
Can you?

54
00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.666
Is Hu Tianyi's brain flooded?

55
00:01:34.766 --> 00:01:36.066
I just said clearly

56
00:01:36.066 --> 00:01:38.466
My phone can predict the weather

57
00:01:38.466 --> 00:01:40.600
Accuracy up to 99%

58
00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.333
Of course predicting the weather

59
00:01:42.333 --> 00:01:44.633
Just one of its small functions

60
00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:47.400
More importantly, he can predict natural disasters

61
00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:51.500
It's 99 percent accurate.

62
00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:52.900
You cooperate far
