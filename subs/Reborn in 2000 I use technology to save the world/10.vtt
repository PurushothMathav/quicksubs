00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:10.800
Hahahahaha stinky papa liar papa

2
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.066
You just don't want to accompany Yaoyao on her birthday

3
00:00:13.066 --> 00:00:14.566
Yaoyao hates you

4
00:00:14.566 --> 00:00:17.466
Hahahahaha great prophet

5
00:00:17.666 --> 00:00:19.266
big scientist

6
00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:20.566
What about the earthquake you mentioned?

7
00:00:20.566 --> 00:00:21.900
Why haven't you seen an earthquake?

8
00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.366
Why didn't the earthquake happen?

9
00:00:24.066 --> 00:00:24.866
That's not possible.

10
00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.400
My presence must have caused the butterfly effect

11
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.933
Qingfeng, what nonsense are you talking about?

12
00:00:29.933 --> 00:00:32.000
I see you shut yourself in your room

13
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.366
Stupid breeze

14
00:00:33.466 --> 00:00:35.366
I'll see how you explain it to Special Shou

15
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.566
How to explain to the people of the whole city

16
00:00:37.566 --> 00:00:39.600
You deceive people and create fire

17
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.366
Wait for Lao Tzu to make a river

18
00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:44.700
Hello

19
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:49.033
What project stoppage caused the deal to be delayed?

20
00:00:49.166 --> 00:00:50.766
The police cancelled it.

21
00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:54.766
It's over, that's an order of tens of millions

22
00:00:54.933 --> 00:00:57.300
I'm broke

23
00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.900
What, you want to fire me if you don't finish the plan?

24
00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.000
No, I might have an earthquake here.

25
00:01:02.066 --> 00:01:03.533
Hello

26
00:01:03.533 --> 00:01:05.133

27
00:01:05.133 --> 00:01:07.266
He also disrupted my Hu family's technology exchange meeting

28
00:01:07.266 --> 00:01:08.666
Made me lose 100 million

29
00:01:08.666 --> 00:01:09.666
This guy?

30
00:01:09.666 --> 00:01:11.300
Say there's a shit earthquake

31
00:01:11.366 --> 00:01:12.966
See if everyone can't work.

32
00:01:12.966 --> 00:01:14.300
Can't go back home

33
00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:15.600
Money can't be earned

34
00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.566
We can't let him go today bastard

35
00:01:18.666 --> 00:01:21.633
The amazing father is bankrupt, I will fucking kill you

36
00:01:21.933 --> 00:01:22.900
Add me one.

37
00:01:22.966 --> 00:01:26.300
My annual salary 300,000 job gone

38
00:01:26.366 --> 00:01:28.833
What do you have to say about earthquakes?

39
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.966
Now the factory is bankrupt

40
00:01:30.966 --> 00:01:31.966
lost his job

41
00:01:31.966 --> 00:01:33.500
What do you say this does now?

42
00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.166
What should I do? Kill him for me!

43
00:01:37.166 --> 00:01:39.033
Kill him to protect me Yaoyao

44
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:42.966
What are you doing?

45
00:01:42.966 --> 00:01:43.966
Don't get excited

46
00:01:43.966 --> 00:01:46.066
There will be an earthquake later, which will be very dangerous.

47
00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.133
Stinky dad cheated dad to death

48
00:01:48.133 --> 00:01:51.200
I want people to hate your master, if you dare to get hurt

49
00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.266
I won't let you go.

50
00:01:52.266 --> 00:01:54.900
What earthquake do you still dare to say about Qin Feng?

51
00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:56.733
It seems that I won't give you some color today.

52
00:01:56.733 --> 00:02:01.500
Ahhh! Help!

53
00:02:02.733 --> 00:02:03.533
Ah!
