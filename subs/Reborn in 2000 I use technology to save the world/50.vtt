00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:01.900
This robot was so much fun.

2
00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:02.600
That's all.

3
00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:05.166
How many times stronger than the island country blue fat man?

4
00:00:05.933 --> 00:00:07.100
How dare you scold us

5
00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:08.333
So what about you?

6
00:00:08.333 --> 00:00:10.066
Aren't you idiots?

7
00:00:10.066 --> 00:00:11.600
You especially are an idiot

8
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:13.466
This Xiaoxue classmate is too cute

9
00:00:13.466 --> 00:00:15.633
Dad, you are amazing

10
00:00:15.733 --> 00:00:19.266
To be able to build such an interesting robot

11
00:00:19.466 --> 00:00:20.466
You rubbish

12
00:00:20.466 --> 00:00:22.600
You dare to scold me, so what?

13
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.466
I'm buzzing are you a pig?

14
00:00:24.866 --> 00:00:27.533
What are you? You have a big head and a thick neck. You don't look like a big man.

15
00:00:27.533 --> 00:00:28.366
But like a pig

16
00:00:28.366 --> 00:00:31.800
Hahahahaha joking, Mr. Hu

17
00:00:31.866 --> 00:00:32.966
Don't argue with him.

18
00:00:32.966 --> 00:00:34.000
You can't argue with him

19
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.200
Impossible, he's in there for something, someone is pretending

20
00:00:37.466 --> 00:00:38.800
I'll open it for him

21
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.133
Don't touch me!

22
00:00:40.133 --> 00:00:41.566
I'll electrocute you

23
00:00:48.333 --> 00:00:50.500
This robot is so powerful

24
00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.166
Fatty Blue is like a retard compared to him

25
00:00:54.166 --> 00:00:56.400
Duan Mengran, you are right

26
00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:58.600
Xiaoxue not only has many functions

27
00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.400
It can even turn into an airplane and take to the sky.

28
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.266
It can also be turned into a car to carry goods

29
00:01:03.266 --> 00:01:06.000
Can you also go to disaster relief when disaster strikes?

30
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.700
Can be turned into airplanes and cars

31
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.200
That's Transformers.

32
00:01:11.366 --> 00:01:14.033
To be precise, it is more powerful than Transformers.

33
00:01:15.066 --> 00:01:16.066
How is that possible?

34
00:01:16.166 --> 00:01:17.266
Why not?

35
00:01:17.266 --> 00:01:19.866
Just this Ichiro than mobile phone, you can't beat Hua Guo

36
00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:21.266
Not as good as a robot.

37
00:01:21.266 --> 00:01:22.933
Why don't you get out of here?

38
00:01:22.933 --> 00:01:23.800
That is.

39
00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:27.266
Get out of here haha this little devil wants to kick out

40
00:01:27.266 --> 00:01:29.366
I didn't expect to kick it on the iron plate

41
00:01:29.366 --> 00:01:30.266
Get out

42
00:01:30.266 --> 00:01:33.600
Get out get out get out get out get out

43
00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.066
Get out of here

44
00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.933
Yes, today is the launch of the gorgeous mobile phone.

45
00:01:38.933 --> 00:01:41.033
It was just a little interlude

46
00:01:41.466 --> 00:01:44.333
In fact, Xiaoxue still has many functions

47
00:01:44.333 --> 00:01:46.500
And I'm going to go through them.

48
00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:47.700
Then you can say it again

49
00:01:47.766 --> 00:01:49.300
What other functions does it have?

50
00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:51.133
Yes, when are you going to sell it?

51
00:01:51.133 --> 00:01:52.366
I still plan to buy it

52
00:01:52.366 --> 00:01:53.933
It's not time to go on sale yet

53
00:01:53.933 --> 00:01:56.000
But I can tell you a little bit about it.

54
00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.033
The function of Xiaoxue

55
00:01:57.366 --> 00:01:59.366
Not only is he proficient in the pronunciation of various countries

56
00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.066
You can even predict natural disasters like a gorgeous phone

57
00:02:03.066 --> 00:02:04.366
Nonsense
