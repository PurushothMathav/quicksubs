00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:01.266
What's going on?

2
00:00:01.266 --> 00:00:02.866
I'm taking a nap at home

3
00:00:02.866 --> 00:00:04.100
Just notify that there is an earthquake

4
00:00:04.166 --> 00:00:05.466
Come to Tiancheng Square

5
00:00:05.466 --> 00:00:06.866
Yeah, I was working overtime

6
00:00:06.866 --> 00:00:07.800
The plan is not finished yet

7
00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:08.566
Can't do it anymore

8
00:00:08.566 --> 00:00:09.866
This company can't fire me

9
00:00:09.866 --> 00:00:11.766
I wanted to take advantage of this exchange meeting

10
00:00:11.766 --> 00:00:13.800
Reached a cooperation with the island consortium

11
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:14.900
Head across the phone

12
00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:18.200
The entire dog industry was ruined by Qin Feng

13
00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:19.400
Take a look everyone

14
00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:20.733
All because of this guy

15
00:00:20.733 --> 00:00:23.200
The mysterious chief executive lied about the earthquake

16
00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.200
It makes us make trouble with me

17
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:26.700
Three all-nighters

18
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:28.066
It's you kid

19
00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:29.600
I can't even make up for it, can I?

20
00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.933
I've been looking for this job for three months before I can find it.

21
00:00:31.933 --> 00:00:33.900
Today is the last day to submit proposals

22
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:35.533
If you hurt my job

23
00:00:35.533 --> 00:00:36.800
I hurry up

24
00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.600
Work hard and study hard

25
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:39.966
It's all caused by this kid

26
00:00:39.966 --> 00:00:41.833
Ladies and gentlemen, listen to me.

27
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:43.666
What I said is true.

28
00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.333
There's going to be a big earthquake here soon.

29
00:00:46.333 --> 00:00:48.200
This fountain is the safest place

30
00:00:48.366 --> 00:00:49.900
Life safety is of paramount importance

31
00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.200
Everyone, find a safe place to hide

32
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.000
Hey

33
00:00:54.466 --> 00:00:56.866
Mo Xue, hurry up and bring Yaoyao over

34
00:00:56.866 --> 00:00:58.366
I'm not going in

35
00:00:58.366 --> 00:00:59.900
Not at all right

36
00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.366
Dad just doesn't want to accompany Yaoyao on her birthday

37
00:01:02.366 --> 00:01:04.900
Let Yaoyao get wet

38
00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:06.800
Breeze doesn't necessarily have earthquakes

39
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.433
Don't let the child soak in water

40
00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:10.466
Hey breeze

41
00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:13.933
Everyone, hurry up!

42
00:01:13.933 --> 00:01:14.733
Qin Feng

43
00:01:14.766 --> 00:01:17.166
You can fool the Chief Executive into saying there is an earthquake

44
00:01:17.166 --> 00:01:18.300
Do you still want to deceive everyone?

45
00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.066
You have achieved nothing

46
00:01:20.066 --> 00:01:21.666
Who do you think will believe what you say?

47
00:01:21.666 --> 00:01:23.700
Breeze, I think you are crazy

48
00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.366
Run into the fountain to avoid earthquakes

49
00:01:25.533 --> 00:01:28.266
Cut his face off like a clown

50
00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.366
There will be a big earthquake in 2 minutes

51
00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:32.666
This is the safest place

52
00:01:32.666 --> 00:01:34.166
Come here, everyone

53
00:01:34.333 --> 00:01:36.700
Qingfeng, is your brain flooded?

54
00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:37.333
Say earthquake

55
00:01:37.333 --> 00:01:39.766
The mysterious chief executive has caused everyone to suffer huge losses

56
00:01:39.766 --> 00:01:41.533
I want everyone to take the same position as you

57
00:01:41.533 --> 00:01:44.066
It's not like his brain is flooded

58
00:01:44.066 --> 00:01:46.600
How can you say that there is a painting like an earthquake?

59
00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.000
City shutdown

60
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.100
How much damage is that going to cause?

61
00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.766
Let's beat you to death together, you rumor-mongering dog

62
00:01:52.933 --> 00:01:54.100
Tossed by you like this

63
00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.600
If the earthquake doesn't come, it's not over with you

64
00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:57.400
ahead

65
00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.733
Didn't you say there would be an earthquake in two minutes?

66
00:02:00.733 --> 00:02:06.766
Earthquake 54321

67
00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:08.233
Earthquake is coming
