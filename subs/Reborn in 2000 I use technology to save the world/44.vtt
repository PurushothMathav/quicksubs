00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:03.366
Wow. Dad brought a robot, too.

2
00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.400
Brother-in-law, where did you get this from?

3
00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:08.766
I developed it myself

4
00:00:08.966 --> 00:00:10.266
Developed by yourself

5
00:00:10.266 --> 00:00:11.966
Hmm, that's ridiculous

6
00:00:11.966 --> 00:00:14.233
Qingfeng, you beat the phone

7
00:00:14.266 --> 00:00:16.866
Can you still develop robots?

8
00:00:16.933 --> 00:00:19.200
Find a bunch of rubbish and put it together

9
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.366
Let's just say it's a robot.

10
00:00:20.366 --> 00:00:21.600
Are you kidding?

11
00:00:22.266 --> 00:00:24.333
Which seedy market did you buy it from?

12
00:00:24.333 --> 00:00:25.600
secondhand activation

13
00:00:26.133 --> 00:00:28.466
Screen I said why are you not here

14
00:00:28.466 --> 00:00:31.233
It turned out that after seeing the robots in our island country

15
00:00:31.266 --> 00:00:33.600
I went to the second-hand market to buy models.

16
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:34.733
Hahaha

17
00:00:34.733 --> 00:00:37.500
As a model, I have arms and legs and can walk

18
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:38.500
Pretty realistic

19
00:00:38.933 --> 00:00:40.600
Unfortunately, including China

20
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.166
There is simply no way to develop robots that go beyond island countries

21
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:44.300
screen

22
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:45.666
Do you hear me?

23
00:00:45.866 --> 00:00:49.133
Don't embarrass yourself here

24
00:00:49.133 --> 00:00:51.400
Trash, I see you look like that

25
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.833
The blue fat guy in my trash can is trash

26
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:55.000
unblock

27
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.333
How dare you fall into the high technology of our island country

28
00:00:57.333 --> 00:00:59.366
Do you know how advanced blue hats are?

29
00:00:59.666 --> 00:01:01.000
He understands instructions.

30
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.433
It plays music.

31
00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.700
Fatty Blue plays a piano song

32
00:01:06.266 --> 00:01:08.033
Open their eyes

33
00:01:15.166 --> 00:01:16.600
It actually plays music

34
00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:17.900
As expected of an island country

35
00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:19.700
This is real high-tech.

36
00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.900
What high-tech is playing songs?

37
00:01:22.366 --> 00:01:25.300
Xiaoxue can not only play piano music

38
00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:27.366
You can even play the piano.
