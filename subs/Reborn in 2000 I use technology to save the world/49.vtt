00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:02.266
Xiaoxue has started

2
00:00:21.366 --> 00:00:22.166
How is that possible?

3
00:00:22.166 --> 00:00:24.066
It really moved Alice

4
00:00:24.166 --> 00:00:26.666
Is this a supermarket and other robots?

5
00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.833
Xiaoxue, you are amazing

6
00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:31.333
How is that possible?

7
00:00:31.333 --> 00:00:33.733
Isn't this second-hand broken model just a program?

8
00:00:33.733 --> 00:00:35.266
How can you complete such complex instructions?

9
00:00:35.266 --> 00:00:36.866
This is hell.

10
00:00:36.866 --> 00:00:38.566
It must be the track you gave you in advance.

11
00:00:38.566 --> 00:00:40.100
Homeowner's robot boutique

12
00:00:40.733 --> 00:00:42.066
Arrange in advance

13
00:00:42.166 --> 00:00:44.166
Okay, Xiaoxue

14
00:00:44.266 --> 00:00:45.200
Change another song

15
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.666
This is really like childhood

16
00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.666
This is the first snow in Bandari.

17
00:01:00.566 --> 00:01:01.666
Is it enough?

18
00:01:01.666 --> 00:01:03.600
Would you like to change another one for you?

19
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.133
Xiaoxue is enough

20
00:01:05.133 --> 00:01:06.766
Come back, Breeze

21
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.966
Is this really a super intelligent machine?

22
00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:10.566
Of course, Xiao Xiao

23
00:01:10.566 --> 00:01:12.633
Not only talks about all the piano music in the world

24
00:01:12.766 --> 00:01:14.433
Even clean all the instruments

25
00:01:14.666 --> 00:01:15.800
I didn't expect it to be so powerful

26
00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.266
This is an intelligent machine

27
00:01:17.266 --> 00:01:18.900
Much more powerful than the island country

28
00:01:18.933 --> 00:01:22.333
Didn't Hu Tianyi just say to wash his hair upside down?

29
00:01:22.333 --> 00:01:23.133
you

30
00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.066
It must be all fake

31
00:01:25.066 --> 00:01:26.166
Don't try to fool us

32
00:01:26.166 --> 00:01:28.666
Fake is better than fake

33
00:01:28.733 --> 00:01:30.466
You guys have really opened my eyes.

34
00:01:30.566 --> 00:01:31.366
police

35
00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.766
You don't just put all the fogging into storage.

36
00:01:33.766 --> 00:01:35.966
Chip? No, what is fake?

37
00:01:35.966 --> 00:01:37.733
Do you think that Fatty Blue can't compare to you?

38
00:01:37.733 --> 00:01:38.666
First model?

39
00:01:38.666 --> 00:01:42.066
Don't forget that Fatty Blue can also teach children to learn foreign languages

40
00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.433
Is this high-tech your junk comparable to this?

41
00:01:46.166 --> 00:01:48.766
Teaching kids a foreign language is high tech.

42
00:01:48.766 --> 00:01:50.433
Let me show you.

43
00:01:58.733 --> 00:02:01.866
Why is Mr. Black Rice Bay Red Bean Mud Card?

44
00:02:01.866 --> 00:02:04.300
What does he mean?

45
00:02:04.533 --> 00:02:07.000
He's telling us that I'm an idiot.
