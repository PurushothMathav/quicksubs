00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:01.700
everyone

2
00:00:02.066 --> 00:00:05.700
This phone is going to change your perception.

3
00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.866
Hey, why is this phone black?

4
00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:14.800
This screen this is the screen

5
00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:15.866
Such a big screen

6
00:00:15.866 --> 00:00:16.766
Folding screen

7
00:00:16.766 --> 00:00:18.666
He actually folded the screen.

8
00:00:18.666 --> 00:00:21.400
We can't do that with our current technology.

9
00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.733
Is this design really novel and beautiful?

10
00:00:23.733 --> 00:00:24.866
This is the first time I've seen it.

11
00:00:24.866 --> 00:00:27.166
This design is truly incredible.

12
00:00:27.333 --> 00:00:28.133
everyone

13
00:00:28.166 --> 00:00:31.100
It's a phone with the latest technology.

14
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.000
No matter from the design of the system

15
00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:35.266
Or from the interface design of the UI

16
00:00:35.266 --> 00:00:37.233
Are the best in the world

17
00:00:37.466 --> 00:00:38.300
Here we go.

18
00:00:38.333 --> 00:00:41.000
Let me show you what it does.

19
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.066
And operation

20
00:00:44.866 --> 00:00:45.900
Not just touch screen operation

21
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:47.000
Or a virtual keyboard?

22
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.933
This is better than the ugly and hard solid-state keyboards we have today

23
00:00:48.933 --> 00:00:50.066
More technology

24
00:00:50.066 --> 00:00:52.166
Can this phone really play games?

25
00:00:52.166 --> 00:00:53.466
The picture is so clear

26
00:00:53.466 --> 00:00:54.800
Manipulation is so smooth

27
00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.666
That's way beyond anything we have today.

28
00:00:56.666 --> 00:00:58.466
Ok, those games used to be

29
00:00:58.533 --> 00:01:00.300
But our system is already ahead of us

30
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.200
Now I have a mobile phone for an era

31
00:01:02.266 --> 00:01:04.366
Yes, this operating system is simple and elegant

32
00:01:04.366 --> 00:01:05.300
Easy to operate

33
00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.500
Jin Feng will definitely become a major military trainer in the future

34
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:08.333
I didn't expect it.

35
00:01:08.333 --> 00:01:10.300
I can't believe you can build a single system.

36
00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.800
This has never been done before.

37
00:01:12.866 --> 00:01:14.900
What my ex-husband said turned out to be true

38
00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:18.466
Mom, Dad, is this phone awesome?

39
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.633
Very impressive. Very impressive.

40
00:01:20.766 --> 00:01:24.166
Good dad great

41
00:01:24.666 --> 00:01:25.700
That's amazing.

42
00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.066
If this system can be used on gorgeous mobile phones

43
00:01:30.066 --> 00:01:32.466
Gorgeous phones can definitely come back to life

44
00:01:32.766 --> 00:01:33.966
How is that possible?

45
00:01:33.966 --> 00:01:34.600
This trash

46
00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:35.066
How is that possible?

47
00:01:35.066 --> 00:01:36.866
Independently developed a mobile phone system

48
00:01:36.866 --> 00:01:38.933
There are also large computer games built into it

49
00:01:38.933 --> 00:01:41.633
This is enough to kill Sharp in seconds

50
00:01:42.733 --> 00:01:43.966
What system?

51
00:01:43.966 --> 00:01:44.933
Is it important?

52
00:01:44.933 --> 00:01:46.266
Of course it matters.

53
00:01:46.266 --> 00:01:48.800
This mobile phone system is enough to lead the era

54
00:01:48.933 --> 00:01:50.766
I think Sharp is great

55
00:01:50.766 --> 00:01:52.633
It can't be broken, but it can also smash walnuts.

56
00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:54.533
Damn this kid

57
00:01:54.533 --> 00:01:57.200
To be able to develop such an excellent mobile phone system

58
00:01:57.266 --> 00:01:58.066
No way.

59
00:01:58.933 --> 00:02:00.700
Acquire Gorgeous City as soon as possible

60
00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:02.466
Auntie is right

61
00:02:02.466 --> 00:02:04.100
What is a cell phone system?

62
00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:05.566
A dedicated R & D team in the lower bunk

63
00:02:05.566 --> 00:02:06.966
Make it in minutes

64
00:02:06.966 --> 00:02:08.966
Qin Feng said

65
00:02:09.133 --> 00:02:11.266
Can you smash walnuts with this phone?
