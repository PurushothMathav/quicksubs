00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:04.666
Oh, I'll go.

2
00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:10.233
Luckily my office is in the suburbs

3
00:00:18.533 --> 00:00:20.166
Hey Mr. Gen

4
00:00:20.166 --> 00:00:22.266
How is the purchase of gorgeous water?

5
00:00:22.266 --> 00:00:23.066
Mr. Gen

6
00:00:23.133 --> 00:00:24.866
There was an earthquake in the city today.

7
00:00:24.966 --> 00:00:26.233
So I didn't.

8
00:00:26.566 --> 00:00:27.966
Yes, I am not doing my best.

9
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.233
But I heard that

10
00:00:29.266 --> 00:00:30.866
Gorgeous to attend next week at

11
00:00:30.866 --> 00:00:33.033
Technology fair held by Haicheng Resort

12
00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:35.866
I want to get the bonus to save Gorgeous

13
00:00:36.066 --> 00:00:37.666
If we can defeat Gorgeous

14
00:00:37.733 --> 00:00:39.966
They have no chance to turn around

15
00:00:42.066 --> 00:00:44.733
Weather forecast, our phones are very nervous.

16
00:00:44.733 --> 00:00:45.933
You bring to participate

17
00:00:45.933 --> 00:00:47.233
If you are busy again this time

18
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.833
Forget about the cooperation of uncle

19
00:00:49.866 --> 00:00:52.300
Hey, okay, okay, hey.

20
00:01:01.133 --> 00:01:03.500
Fortunately, the situation at home is not too early

21
00:01:04.366 --> 00:01:05.166
Yaoyao

22
00:01:05.266 --> 00:01:07.100
Do a cleaning game with dad

23
00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.166
Okay, okay?

24
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.033
Why is Qin Feng completely different from before?

25
00:01:23.933 --> 00:01:26.900
What's the point of cleaning or not?

26
00:01:27.733 --> 00:01:29.233
What happened to Mo Xue?

27
00:01:29.333 --> 00:01:30.500
To save the gorgeous

28
00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.200
I have mortgaged my house

29
00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.400
If not for the earthquake

30
00:01:33.566 --> 00:01:34.166
Bank door-to-door

31
00:01:34.166 --> 00:01:36.766
I'm afraid the debt collectors would have kicked us out long ago

32
00:01:36.766 --> 00:01:40.200
Mom, I don't want to be kicked out.

33
00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:43.633
Yaoyao, don't worry.

34
00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:44.966
As long as dad is there

35
00:01:44.966 --> 00:01:46.833
No one can drive us away

36
00:01:48.533 --> 00:01:50.266
Don't worry, classmate.

37
00:01:50.333 --> 00:01:51.966
I will make one ASAP.

38
00:01:51.966 --> 00:01:53.633
Cross-generational smartphones

39
00:01:53.733 --> 00:01:55.700
Then he can wear gorgeous

40
00:01:55.766 --> 00:01:57.300
Rise to the top of the entire tech world

41
00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:58.866
How is that possible?

42
00:01:58.933 --> 00:02:00.600
Phones are a shortcut to technology.

43
00:02:00.766 --> 00:02:02.333
Even if you have a new idea

44
00:02:02.333 --> 00:02:05.000
With gorgeous outdated equipment, it is even more impossible to achieve

45
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Say

46
00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.066
Now the gorgeous factory has also been destroyed

47
00:02:09.333 --> 00:02:10.333
Don't worry about this.

48
00:02:10.333 --> 00:02:12.133
I will contact the National Academy of Sciences as soon as possible

49
00:02:12.133 --> 00:02:13.833
They will help

50
00:02:14.366 --> 00:02:15.200
Breeze

51
00:02:15.666 --> 00:02:18.000
The National Academy of Sciences is the highest level of scientific research in the country

52
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.166
Institutions don't talk about you and me

53
00:02:20.166 --> 00:02:22.666
Even if you save money, it's a project worth tens of billions

54
00:02:22.666 --> 00:02:24.600
It may not be able to invite the Academy of Sciences

55
00:02:25.466 --> 00:02:28.166
Forget it, you should stay at home with Yaoyao

56
00:02:28.166 --> 00:02:31.200
Forget about the company, dad brags

57
00:02:31.266 --> 00:02:34.366
How could the National Academy of Sciences possibly care about you?

58
00:02:37.466 --> 00:02:39.966
Humph the car and ignore me
