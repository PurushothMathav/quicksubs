00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.666
This is the case with teachers recently.

2
00:00:04.566 --> 00:00:07.300
Don't dare you two bastards

3
00:00:07.366 --> 00:00:09.100
Yes, he did not acquire Gorgeous.

4
00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:11.533
Even let our island country issue an announcement saying no

5
00:00:11.533 --> 00:00:13.033
Teacher Luohuaguo

6
00:00:13.133 --> 00:00:16.033
How can a poorly diligent mobile phone predict natural disasters?

7
00:00:16.166 --> 00:00:17.600
This is what we all saw.

8
00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:19.433
A Book

9
00:00:19.566 --> 00:00:21.166
How is it possible? Yunze natural disaster

10
00:00:21.166 --> 00:00:23.066
You've all been sidelined by him.

11
00:00:23.066 --> 00:00:24.500
Oh yes yes yes

12
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.066
That kid Qingfeng is a liar at first glance

13
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:28.400
Mr. Gen

14
00:00:29.066 --> 00:00:33.400
This Mr. Koizumi is the president of the Academy of Sciences of the Island Nation

15
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.866
And he's also a Nobel Prize winner

16
00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.500
Besides, I have already investigated that front.

17
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.766
He's just a minor in the National Academy of Sciences

18
00:00:40.766 --> 00:00:42.066
junior researcher

19
00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.700
Could it be that we were really deceived by him?

20
00:00:44.866 --> 00:00:45.666
swallow

21
00:00:45.866 --> 00:00:46.933
Teacher don't worry

22
00:00:46.933 --> 00:00:50.533
I will definitely find a chance for him to apologize in person.

23
00:00:50.533 --> 00:00:52.100
Why look for opportunities?

24
00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.566
Isn't there a chance now?

25
00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.900
OK

26
00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:57.000
Ah!

27
00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.800
Isn't this just a doll, boss?

28
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.633
This is us at the German Academy of Sciences.

29
00:01:04.733 --> 00:01:06.900
The latest intelligent machine

30
00:01:06.966 --> 00:01:07.766
Less than one point

31
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.400
It does a lot of things.

32
00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.300
Can make the active technology restore the level

33
00:01:11.333 --> 00:01:13.200
It can also be based on military Wuchang songs

34
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:14.766
Dangdang children learn

35
00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.300
Oops that's awesome

36
00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:18.933
As expected of the technology of the island country

37
00:01:18.933 --> 00:01:22.100
It's a beacon of human technology.

38
00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:25.466
Teacher, you are really amazing

39
00:01:25.566 --> 00:01:27.100
With this robot

40
00:01:27.133 --> 00:01:29.066
Even if he could predict natural disasters

41
00:01:29.133 --> 00:01:32.966
We can also crush him

42
00:01:32.966 --> 00:01:35.900
I've always wanted to participate in volcanic engineering on our island country

43
00:01:36.166 --> 00:01:37.666
He works with our technology

44
00:01:38.533 --> 00:01:40.200
I came to China this time

45
00:01:40.266 --> 00:01:41.866
Just to sign a contract with Director Yue

46
00:01:41.966 --> 00:01:44.200
Then you can use Doraemon first.

47
00:01:44.533 --> 00:01:45.633
Defeat Qin Peng

48
00:01:45.733 --> 00:01:47.966
Expose the flames of his predictions of natural disasters

49
00:01:47.966 --> 00:01:49.600
I'll ask Director Yue to find a relationship

50
00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.366
Drive him out of the Chinese Academy of Sciences

51
00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:52.833
Hey, hey.

52
00:02:03.933 --> 00:02:06.300
Why are there so many people in Qingfeng?

53
00:02:06.466 --> 00:02:08.200
Is there any treatment?
