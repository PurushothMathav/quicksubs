00:00:00.466 --> 00:00:02.100
Chinf, I confess

2
00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.200
You became a Chinese worker at a young age

3
00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:05.266
Chief Engineer of Chengyuan

4
00:00:05.266 --> 00:00:06.333
There is some level

5
00:00:06.333 --> 00:00:08.600
But don't take us all for fools.

6
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:11.100
The machine also said that the machine is like a mobile phone

7
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:12.300
Able to predict sky loads

8
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:13.733
With just one machine

9
00:00:13.733 --> 00:00:15.333
How is it possible to predict the global sky load?

10
00:00:15.333 --> 00:00:17.533
It's both fundamental and technological.

11
00:00:17.533 --> 00:00:18.133
Impossible

12
00:00:18.133 --> 00:00:18.933
Breeze

13
00:00:19.066 --> 00:00:21.800
Do you think we will believe your nonsense?

14
00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.666
You just happened to encounter an earthquake and tsunami

15
00:00:24.666 --> 00:00:27.966
You give all the credit to your phone.

16
00:00:27.966 --> 00:00:29.266
Also use your robot

17
00:00:29.266 --> 00:00:30.700
Do you think we are fools?

18
00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:33.000
Qingfeng, you can fool ordinary people

19
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
That Mr. Koizumi is a Nobel Prize winner

20
00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.066
He can see through your tricks at a glance

21
00:00:38.066 --> 00:00:40.600
What does it have to do with me whether you believe it or not?

22
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.433
Qingfeng, what do you mean by this cold talk?

23
00:00:43.533 --> 00:00:44.366
Aren't you just afraid?

24
00:00:44.366 --> 00:00:46.700
The more afraid he is, the more he is allowed to prove

25
00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:47.366
Yes!

26
00:00:47.366 --> 00:00:49.966
Before that, it was said that this machine could rain away natural disasters

27
00:00:49.966 --> 00:00:51.733
Strive for power up to 99%

28
00:00:51.733 --> 00:00:53.666
Why don't you predict again?

29
00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:56.500
Let's all check it out

30
00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:57.966
Why not?

31
00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.966
Squad leader, we want to specify the forecast location

32
00:01:02.066 --> 00:01:04.266
Old West, you're just smart

33
00:01:04.266 --> 00:01:06.500
This will only prevent them from having rubber bands and fists.

34
00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.466
Deceived us

35
00:01:08.466 --> 00:01:10.433
Then let you specify the prediction location

36
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:13.933
So make a prediction.

37
00:01:13.933 --> 00:01:16.366
When will the volcano on our island erupt?

38
00:01:16.366 --> 00:01:16.766
Your island

39
00:01:16.766 --> 00:01:18.700
The country's volcanic reconstruction project is coming to an end

40
00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:19.666
How could it erupt?

41
00:01:19.666 --> 00:01:21.533
Didn't you mean to embarrass always Qin?

42
00:01:21.533 --> 00:01:23.966
Well, since they want to know

43
00:01:23.966 --> 00:01:26.400
So let's make a prediction and show them.

44
00:01:26.466 --> 00:01:27.300
Xiaoxue

45
00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.500
Predict when the island nation's volcano will erupt

46
00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:30.600
Good master

47
00:01:32.966 --> 00:01:36.000
The volcano in the host island country erupts in 10 minutes
