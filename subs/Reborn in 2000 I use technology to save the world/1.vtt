It's incredible.

4
00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:22.366
The French actually have controlled nuclear fusion.

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.266
Great, it finally worked.

Your bird is going to commit suicide

19
00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.700
Yaoyao Yaoyao

20
00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:57.066
You silly boy

21
00:00:57.066 --> 00:00:58.800
It's your birthday today

22
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.400
How could you commit suicide?

23
00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:01.200
Yaoyao

24
00:01:01.366 --> 00:01:04.133
Dad's research on nuclear fusion has succeeded

25
00:01:04.133 --> 00:01:04.933
You see

26
00:01:04.933 --> 00:01:07.500
This is the Order of the Human Kingdom that Dad received

27
00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.100
Daddy will make you a present, okay?

28
00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:10.200
Open your eyes and see

29
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.166
Take a look.

30
00:01:11.733 --> 00:01:13.166
No medal

31
00:01:14.066 --> 00:01:16.666
I just want you to spend your birthday with me

32
00:01:16.666 --> 00:01:18.200
Is it that hard?

33
00:01:20.866 --> 00:01:23.933
Smelly dad said he would accompany me on my birthday

34
00:01:23.933 --> 00:01:25.466
Why haven't you come?

35
00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:27.700
Yaoyao is good

36
00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:34.833
Yaoyao wake up

37
00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:37.900
Yaoyao father Yaoyao

38
00:01:41.466 --> 00:01:43.700
Dad is a liar

39
00:01:43.733 --> 00:01:46.800
Yaoyao Yaoyao doesn't trust him anymore, mother

40
00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:48.500
I want to go home.

41
00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:50.966
Yaoyao is good

42
00:01:50.966 --> 00:01:53.366
Dad said he would come and he would come

43
00:01:53.366 --> 00:01:56.600
Let's wait for him, okay?

44
00:01:58.166 --> 00:02:00.000
Ah, what's going on?

45
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:00.933
Why don't you go home?

46
00:02:00.933 --> 00:02:03.200
Yaoyao, go, run

47
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:04.800
Be careful.

48
00:02:05.166 --> 00:02:08.000
Help, how do you come out and run Yaoyao?

49
00:02:09.933 --> 00:02:10.733
Yaoyao

50
00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:14.100
It's dad who's sorry for you, it's not me who's sorry

51
00:02:14.133 --> 00:02:17.500
It's my mom because you didn't come

52
00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.700
Mom will be remarried by me selling the company

53
00:02:21.066 --> 00:02:22.566
Because you didn't come

54
00:02:22.566 --> 00:02:24.600
We will have an earthquake

55
00:02:24.933 --> 00:02:26.700
Mom will die

56
00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:28.900
I will reach into the twin

57
00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.133
Can't bear to kneel

58
00:02:30.133 --> 00:02:35.200
20 years. 20 years ago, you killed your wife

59
00:02:35.566 --> 00:02:38.966
In 20 years, you will kill your own mother

60
00:02:38.966 --> 00:02:39.966
Breeze

61
00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.666
I want you to live forever in regret and loneliness

62
00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.033
I Hate You

63
00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.033
Yaoyao Yaoyao

64
00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.300
Dr. Yaoyao

65
00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.266
Doctor doctor

66
00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:58.166
Family and country dilemma

67
00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.766
Yaoyao Mengxue

68
00:03:01.133 --> 00:03:02.866
If I could do it all over again

69
00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.466
I will definitely go to that technology exchange meeting

70
00:03:05.533 --> 00:03:07.166
Keep your mother and daughter safe

71
00:03:14.466 --> 00:03:16.300
How was this my studio 20 years ago?

72
00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:21.766
May 9, 2000 at 11:00 am

73
00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:24.466
I'm reborn, don't miss it when I pass by

74
00:03:24.466 --> 00:03:25.433
What is this?

75
00:03:25.466 --> 00:03:26.700
Come and have a look
