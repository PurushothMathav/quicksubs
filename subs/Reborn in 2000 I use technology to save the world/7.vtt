enter

2
00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.400
Dean Qin Fengqin always posts news on the Internet

3
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.100
It is said that Tiancheng will encounter a major earthquake

4
00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:09.166
What Tiancheng earthquake?

5
00:00:09.166 --> 00:00:11.000
Yes, I have made it happen.

6
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.933
The phone number of the director of the Earthquake Bureau is called up

7
00:00:12.933 --> 00:00:14.966
Do you want to contact him and notify him immediately?

8
00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.000
No one answered the hum

9
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.733
The baloney prick

10
00:00:20.733 --> 00:00:23.766
No, you must find a way to notify Tiancheng ASAP.

11
00:00:23.933 --> 00:00:25.533
This is nonsense.

12
00:00:25.533 --> 00:00:27.300
Oh, Luo Jun, you are finally here.

13
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.600
Quickly expose this lying kid

14
00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.300
Met Lord Temero

15
00:00:31.933 --> 00:00:33.766
I don't know if the Earthquake Bureau has it.

16
00:00:33.766 --> 00:00:36.366
News about the Tiancheng earthquake?

17
00:00:36.366 --> 00:00:38.933
Special Our Tiancheng belongs to the plain

18
00:00:38.933 --> 00:00:40.300
The geological structure is extremely stable

19
00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:41.900
How can an earthquake happen?

20
00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.500
Pioneer, did you hear that?

21
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.200
Luo Jun is from the Earthquake Bureau

22
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.866
What else do you have to say now?

23
00:00:47.166 --> 00:00:49.500
Luo Jun, that trash just now

24
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.900
That's how you predict earthquakes.

25
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.800
Just 15 minutes ago

26
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.566
That's what seismometer he uses

27
00:00:55.566 --> 00:00:56.633
Predicted earthquake

28
00:00:57.266 --> 00:01:01.066
It turned out that it was a building blasting at the construction site next to it.

29
00:01:01.133 --> 00:01:03.000
After he was exposed by us

30
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.166
It was predicted to be an island country earthquake

31
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.566
It's absurd.

32
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.666
Humph nonsense

33
00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.266
With this shit

34
00:01:12.333 --> 00:01:15.900
I also want to predict the earthquake in the island country in China.

35
00:01:15.966 --> 00:01:19.800
Striker, do you know how far Tianchang is from the island country?

36
00:01:19.866 --> 00:01:22.233
Humph, please rest assured.

37
00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:24.100
I asked someone to reassure

38
00:01:24.133 --> 00:01:26.833
Tiancheng will never have an earthquake

39
00:01:27.266 --> 00:01:29.733
There's going to be a big earthquake in Libra in 10 minutes

40
00:01:29.733 --> 00:01:32.100
Luo Jun doesn't hurry up to evacuate the crowd

41
00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.400
Many people will die

42
00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.666
Can you take responsibility for this result?

43
00:01:35.666 --> 00:01:37.833
If you turn 100 stars just by your words

44
00:01:37.933 --> 00:01:41.500
Can you afford the wasted manpower, financial resources and material resources?

45
00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:42.500
hateful

46
00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.133
Time is running out

47
00:01:45.133 --> 00:01:46.466
The crowd must be evacuated as soon as possible

48
00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.866
Breeze Breeze

49
00:01:51.866 --> 00:01:52.933
Attention everyone

50
00:01:52.933 --> 00:01:55.000
There's an earthquake here in 10 minutes

51
00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:55.866
Evacuate quickly

52
00:01:55.866 --> 00:01:56.866
Evacuate quickly

53
00:01:56.866 --> 00:01:58.700
Qin Feng, what are you doing?

54
00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:59.600
shooter

55
00:01:59.733 --> 00:02:03.000
Qin Feng spread rumors and created panic

56
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.300
Now I dare to do this in front of you

57
00:02:05.366 --> 00:02:07.866
I didn't take you seriously at all.

58
00:02:07.866 --> 00:02:09.733
Just don't punish him severely today

59
00:02:09.733 --> 00:02:11.433
It's all messed up the day after tomorrow

60
00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:12.900
Professor Forward

61
00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.066
The striker is just confused for a while

62
00:02:14.066 --> 00:02:14.766
I beg you.

63
00:02:14.766 --> 00:02:15.766
Give him a break this time

64
00:02:15.766 --> 00:02:17.300
What are you confused about?

65
00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.500
I think he did it on purpose at all

66
00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.566
There are no earthquakes in Papa Island

67
00:02:21.566 --> 00:02:23.100
There are no earthquakes in Tiancheng

68
00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:24.400
Quickly admit your mistake

69
00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.800
If you admit your mistake, they won't arrest you. Don't

70
00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.100
Dad didn't lie to you

71
00:02:28.166 --> 00:02:29.400
The island nation has already had an earthquake

72
00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.366
Now we're about to have an earthquake.

73
00:02:31.566 --> 00:02:33.133
Chief Executive, you have seen

74
00:02:33.133 --> 00:02:33.766
This bastard

75
00:02:33.766 --> 00:02:35.766
What island country earthquake are you still talking about?

76
00:02:35.766 --> 00:02:37.100
Tiancheng earthquake!

77
00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:39.533
Come and catch Qin Feng for me

78
00:02:39.533 --> 00:02:41.033
Chief Executive

79
00:02:41.133 --> 00:02:42.066
Latest News

80
00:02:42.066 --> 00:02:44.233
We had a massive earthquake on the island 17 minutes ago.

81
00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.400
What what what
