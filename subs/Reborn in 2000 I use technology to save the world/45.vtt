00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:01.766
It's ridiculous

2
00:00:01.766 --> 00:00:05.500
How could a robot possibly play the piano?

3
00:00:06.066 --> 00:00:08.100
How could this be?

4
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:09.633
This is nonsense.

5
00:00:09.666 --> 00:00:12.900
Breeze, if you brag, you should also pick up some actual bragging

6
00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.700
Qin Feng, you said your robot can play the piano.

7
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.466
That sow can climb trees

8
00:00:19.566 --> 00:00:21.400
Is that why you have no culture?

9
00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.300
Sows can climb trees

10
00:00:23.366 --> 00:00:24.966
Believe it or not?

11
00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.000
I believe dad

12
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:29.766
I also believe in the wind

13
00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:33.700
Your lunatic

14
00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.866
Heaven tells you the truth

15
00:00:35.966 --> 00:00:38.366
Fatty Blue can not only play music

16
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.866
You can teach kids a foreign language.

17
00:00:41.466 --> 00:00:45.233
Fatty Blue greets everyone hello

18
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.066
Tony Frog Vadasi Dora Amon Diesel

19
00:00:51.466 --> 00:00:52.400
That's pretty awesome.

20
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:53.733
Can speak two languages

21
00:00:53.733 --> 00:00:55.666
Yeah, if I buy it back for my child

22
00:00:55.666 --> 00:00:58.200
You can talk to him every day to learn a foreign language

23
00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.266
You see that?

24
00:01:00.266 --> 00:01:02.400
This is the high technology of the island country

25
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.966
This is all mechanical repetition.

26
00:01:04.966 --> 00:01:06.833
It's a high-tech start

27
00:01:07.266 --> 00:01:09.766
How dare you insult the high-tech products of our island country

28
00:01:09.766 --> 00:01:10.966
What right do you have?

29
00:01:10.966 --> 00:01:12.966
Can you just rely on your second-hand rubbish?

30
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.100
It's you trash

31
00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.733
The hardest part of my body is this mouth

32
00:01:17.733 --> 00:01:21.700
I hope you don't just watch Fatty Blue speak two languages

33
00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.166
There's nothing you can do.

34
00:01:23.166 --> 00:01:24.866
You're not like that either.

35
00:01:25.333 --> 00:01:26.966
What are two languages?

36
00:01:27.166 --> 00:01:29.300
Xiaoxue is fluent in 16 languages

37
00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.100
You can even communicate with anyone

38
00:01:31.166 --> 00:01:32.900
He had no problem being a college teacher.
