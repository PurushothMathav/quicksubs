1
00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:03.266
This one is the island country.

2
00:00:03.466 --> 00:00:06.866
The latest development of Sharp mobile phones

3
00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:12.966
Wow, the way this flip opens is amazing.

4
00:00:12.966 --> 00:00:14.366
As expected of an island country

5
00:00:14.366 --> 00:00:15.900
If the shooting was mediocre today

6
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.600
I'm afraid that alone is enough to win the grand prize of shooting

7
00:00:20.133 --> 00:00:21.300
It seems that everyone

8
00:00:21.366 --> 00:00:24.666
The appearance of the phone that has been scared away is stunning

9
00:00:25.066 --> 00:00:27.566
In fact, the appearance is just this phone.

10
00:00:27.566 --> 00:00:29.833
The least significant advantage

11
00:00:29.866 --> 00:00:32.933
It's actually much more powerful.

12
00:00:32.933 --> 00:00:34.300
Especially the fuselage

13
00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.900
It is made of the latest high-tech materials

14
00:00:45.333 --> 00:00:46.500
Hey, what's this?

15
00:00:53.266 --> 00:00:54.066
Ha ha.

16
00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:59.400
Ouch, I'm going here

17
00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.066
Okay, I wanted to

18
00:01:03.066 --> 00:01:05.433
Gorgeous newly developed stand-in material for walking

19
00:01:05.466 --> 00:01:07.700
What did you all do to win this technology selection?

20
00:01:09.766 --> 00:01:11.066
What opportunities do you see in addition?

21
00:01:11.066 --> 00:01:14.766
This phone will also play the computer game Tetris

22
00:01:15.066 --> 00:01:16.966
Built into the phone

23
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.433
Look at the big screen

24
00:01:19.766 --> 00:01:21.000
That's pretty advanced.

25
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.266
Mobile phone companies in our country

26
00:01:22.266 --> 00:01:23.700
Why didn't the industry think of this?

27
00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.400
With the current scientific and technological strength of our country

28
00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:26.900
There's no way to do that.

29
00:01:26.966 --> 00:01:30.166
Well, that's not the most important thing.

30
00:01:30.166 --> 00:01:31.300
You all know that.

31
00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:34.033
There was an earthquake in Tiancheng a few days ago.

32
00:01:34.266 --> 00:01:37.000
If this phone could predict the weather

33
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.300
Even natural disasters

34
00:01:38.333 --> 00:01:41.766
Can everyone avoid risk in advance?

35
00:01:42.266 --> 00:01:43.700
Yeah, yeah.

36
00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.966
Can this phone still predict natural disasters?

37
00:01:48.866 --> 00:01:50.233
Not yet.

38
00:01:50.466 --> 00:01:52.700
But this phone

39
00:01:52.733 --> 00:01:55.133
The function of predicting the weather has been introduced

40
00:01:55.133 --> 00:01:56.700
Built into the phone

41
00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.566
Can predict the weather in real time

42
00:01:58.566 --> 00:02:00.900
Accuracy up to 70%

43
00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:02.666
I believe in the near future

44
00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:06.100
The function of predicting natural disasters will definitely be realized

45
00:02:06.333 --> 00:02:07.900
Ok ok great

46
00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:09.166
So capable

47
00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.400
As expected of a big name in the island country

48
00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:14.966
It's really state-of-the-art technology

49
00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.866
It is not something that some domestic products can catch up with.

50
00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.300
Mom, did we take you?

51
00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.733
How good it would be to listen to my marriage to Hu Shao earlier

52
00:02:23.733 --> 00:02:24.733
That's good.

53
00:02:24.733 --> 00:02:27.366
The bonus is gone, Gorgeous is going bankrupt

54
00:02:27.366 --> 00:02:31.300
You and Yaoyao are going to live in a cave and drink the northwest wind

55
00:02:31.333 --> 00:02:34.466
Yes, sister, Qin Feng, that trash, besides talking

56
00:02:34.466 --> 00:02:35.933
Big talk is useless

57
00:02:35.933 --> 00:02:38.566
He is not qualified to come on an occasion like today

58
00:02:38.566 --> 00:02:40.066
Hu Shao is a hundred times stronger than him

59
00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:43.266
It's not over if you regret it now, is it?

60
00:02:43.866 --> 00:02:46.700
Are there any companies that want to run for election?

61
00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.166
How can this compare?

62
00:02:48.333 --> 00:02:49.000
Yes!

63
00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.166
We design mobile phones to be available for at least 10 years

64
00:02:52.166 --> 00:02:56.166
You will never get Duan Mengxue's 100 million bonus

65
00:02:56.166 --> 00:02:59.366
You and gorgeous can't escape my palm

66
00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:01.633
Since there is no

67
00:03:01.966 --> 00:03:03.166
Then I declare

68
00:03:03.533 --> 00:03:07.500
The first place to win this selection is Sharp mobile phone

69
00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.966
Okay, okay, okay.

70
00:03:13.166 --> 00:03:16.833
The next mobile phone will receive a 100 million bonus

71
00:03:16.933 --> 00:03:18.600
Do you have any comments?

72
00:03:19.533 --> 00:03:20.900
I have an opinion
