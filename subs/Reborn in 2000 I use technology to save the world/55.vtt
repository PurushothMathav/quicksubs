00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.466
Are you dumbfounded?

2
00:00:01.466 --> 00:00:03.866
Slightly dumbfounded, slightly dumbfounded

3
00:00:03.933 --> 00:00:05.200
Chief Engineer of the Academy of Sciences

4
00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:06.600
This is the highest honor

5
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.066
And the existence of the highest academic standards

6
00:00:08.066 --> 00:00:10.600
No wonder he can build such advanced robots

7
00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:11.500
That's not possible.

8
00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:12.600
He's a piece of crap.

9
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:13.600
Right.

10
00:00:13.766 --> 00:00:17.100
When did this loser become the chief engineer?

11
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.366
Absolutely impossible

12
00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:21.433
Qingfeng is our door-to-door son-in-law

13
00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.100
Haven't been out in years

14
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.266
How could he be

15
00:00:24.266 --> 00:00:26.466
Chief Engineer of the National Academy of Sciences

16
00:00:26.566 --> 00:00:27.733
I do research

17
00:00:27.733 --> 00:00:29.900
I can't give you a report every day, can I?

18
00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:30.700
Mom

19
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.166
Qin Feng is really the chief engineer of the National Academy of Sciences

20
00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:34.500
The day we came to Beijing

21
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.400
Dean Li also picked us up

22
00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:40.533
There are also a few grandfathers who said what the dean was

23
00:00:40.533 --> 00:00:42.133
Haha Dean Li

24
00:00:42.133 --> 00:00:43.700
Is this a mistake?

25
00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:44.500
Dean Li

26
00:00:45.166 --> 00:00:46.266
I'm a little old

27
00:00:46.266 --> 00:00:48.366
But I'm not so dizzy

28
00:00:48.366 --> 00:00:49.300
I don't know Mr. Qin

29
00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.733
Yeah, but what can I say?

30
00:00:51.733 --> 00:00:53.066
That does have rights

31
00:00:53.066 --> 00:00:55.866
Decide whether China will participate in volcanic engineering projects

32
00:00:55.866 --> 00:00:57.000
Yes, sir.

33
00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.766
I'm afraid we can't get him to apologize today.

34
00:00:59.766 --> 00:01:02.400
He is just the chief engineer of the Chinese Academy of Engineering

35
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:03.466
No big deal.

36
00:01:03.466 --> 00:01:05.033
If he's really capable

37
00:01:05.066 --> 00:01:06.333
China's technological level

38
00:01:06.333 --> 00:01:07.800
It has long surpassed our Germany

39
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.066
Mr. Koizumi

40
00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.200
The scientific and technological development of our country

41
00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.666
Don't worry about it.

42
00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.566
That's right, our current technological level in China

43
00:01:16.566 --> 00:01:18.000
It is indeed not as good as the island country

44
00:01:18.066 --> 00:01:19.900
But as long as I'm here

45
00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:23.400
I promise to fully surpass the island country within a year

46
00:01:23.666 --> 00:01:25.033
Total Transcendence

47
00:01:25.166 --> 00:01:26.233
Why?

48
00:01:26.566 --> 00:01:29.366
Is this robot based on your appearance?

49
00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.366
Not bad, just rely on Xiaoxue
