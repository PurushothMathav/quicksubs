00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:01.466
After losing

2
00:00:01.666 --> 00:00:05.233
You want to sell your gorgeous shares to the public for 1 yuan

3
00:00:05.766 --> 00:00:07.466
OK, promise.

4
00:00:07.466 --> 00:00:08.966
Is this kid crazy?

5
00:00:08.966 --> 00:00:11.500
Gorgeous is worth tens of millions anyway

6
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:12.866
Isn't this nonsense?

7
00:00:12.866 --> 00:00:13.866
I don't agree with that.

8
00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:16.300
Breeze, can you think before you speak?

9
00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:18.366
Gorgeous, you dare to agree to the hospital community's shot

10
00:00:18.366 --> 00:00:19.900
He was my blood for many years

11
00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:21.100
You rubbish

12
00:00:21.166 --> 00:00:22.766
What qualifications do you have to agree to this condition?

13
00:00:22.766 --> 00:00:24.800
Gorgeous is my mother's hard work

14
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.600
You can't make decisions for mom

15
00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:27.766
Hahahaha

16
00:00:27.766 --> 00:00:29.766
You did me a great favor, kid

17
00:00:30.366 --> 00:00:31.200
Ladies and gentlemen

18
00:00:31.366 --> 00:00:32.266
Colleagues

19
00:00:32.366 --> 00:00:33.666
You heard it.

20
00:00:33.666 --> 00:00:35.400
This is what he personally agreed to

21
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:36.533
You have to testify to me

22
00:00:36.533 --> 00:00:38.900
He is Duan Mengxue's husband

23
00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.166
What he said has the effect of law

24
00:00:42.166 --> 00:00:43.800
Hu Tianyi, stop talking nonsense

25
00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.566
Quickly state your third condition

26
00:00:45.566 --> 00:00:46.766
The third condition

27
00:00:47.566 --> 00:00:49.966
It's simple. If Gorgeous loses

28
00:00:49.966 --> 00:00:51.866
Public announcement required

29
00:00:51.866 --> 00:00:55.700
It is said that China is inferior to the technology of island countries

30
00:00:55.933 --> 00:00:59.500
Chinese people are also the sick man of East Asia in terms of technology

31
00:01:01.466 --> 00:01:02.700
Did you say that?

32
00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:04.266
Yeah, that's way too much.

33
00:01:04.266 --> 00:01:06.366
Guo Tianyi despised it

34
00:01:06.366 --> 00:01:07.900
Don't involve others

35
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.200
Tianyi, you insult your country so much.

36
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.000
Are you still from this country?

37
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.900
Is it important for the people of the country?

38
00:01:14.066 --> 00:01:17.500
You always care about these illusory things

39
00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.966
Can you eat these things for dinner?

40
00:01:19.966 --> 00:01:21.466
Can you spend it as money?

41
00:01:21.466 --> 00:01:22.500
The emperor is right

42
00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:23.166
Say

43
00:01:23.166 --> 00:01:25.866
China's technology is not as good as that of island countries

44
00:01:25.866 --> 00:01:27.466
What the emperor said is not wrong

45
00:01:27.566 --> 00:01:29.666
Just because you don't say it doesn't mean it doesn't exist.

46
00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.300
Is it fun to bury your head in the soil and be an ostrich?

47
00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.533
Envelope 10 million we can afford to lose

48
00:01:35.533 --> 00:01:36.800
Gorgeous, we can also afford to lose

49
00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.700
But you must not agree to this request.

50
00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.933
Otherwise we'll get a divorce now

51
00:01:40.933 --> 00:01:42.533
This is about the face of Huakong Technology

52
00:01:42.533 --> 00:01:43.900
We absolutely can't promise

53
00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:45.100
I can lose now

54
00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.700
But there is definitely a chance in the future to surpass the island countries

55
00:01:47.733 --> 00:01:50.266
If stinky dad dares to agree

56
00:01:50.266 --> 00:01:52.333
I don't recognize you as a father

57
00:01:52.333 --> 00:01:53.566
You dad

58
00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:56.966
Yaoyao, don't worry.

59
00:01:57.133 --> 00:01:58.300
Never lose

60
00:01:59.866 --> 00:02:01.866
I can understand how you feel.

61
00:02:01.866 --> 00:02:03.333
But I can assure you

62
00:02:03.333 --> 00:02:04.866
We will never lose

63
00:02:05.166 --> 00:02:07.400
Our country has a history of thousands of years

64
00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.500
It will never be weaker than any other country in the world

65
00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:13.066
Stop talking nonsense, just say whether you agree or not.

66
00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:17.600
promise
