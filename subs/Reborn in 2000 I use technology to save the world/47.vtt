00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.366
Master, I just danced, is it beautiful?

2
00:00:25.366 --> 00:00:27.900
Xiaoxue, you are so handsome

3
00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.266
That's necessary

4
00:00:29.333 --> 00:00:32.266
I am the super intelligent end point developed by the master

5
00:00:32.333 --> 00:00:34.600
This robot can actually match the conversation

6
00:00:34.933 --> 00:00:36.500
Is he really self-aware?

7
00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.700
The most important thing is that he can dance

8
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.433
This is definitely a complex movement for a robot

9
00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.300
Who says I'm a robot?

10
00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:45.933
I said I was the end point of the super intelligence developed by the master

11
00:00:45.933 --> 00:00:47.700
Please call me Xiaoxue

12
00:00:48.933 --> 00:00:51.900
Breeze, this is really a robot.

13
00:00:51.933 --> 00:00:54.600
Hmm, how is that possible?

14
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.366
He really is like a person.

15
00:00:59.766 --> 00:01:00.966
Do not touch me

16
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:03.466
Have you seen you?

17
00:01:04.066 --> 00:01:05.633
Mr. Ganganmen

18
00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.266
What kind of classmate Xiaoxue seems to be

19
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.900
Is it really stronger than our blue fat man?

20
00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:11.966
That's not possible.

21
00:01:12.366 --> 00:01:15.266
Let's hurry up and help Fatty Blue up, come on

22
00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:19.500
Breeze

23
00:01:19.933 --> 00:01:20.700
You put

24
00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.300
You took the high-tech robot that Mr. Gen walked past

25
00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.866
Broken it.

26
00:01:23.866 --> 00:01:24.866
Can you afford it?

27
00:01:24.866 --> 00:01:27.600
It's going to be really bad.

28
00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.466
You can't afford to lose ten lives.

29
00:01:30.466 --> 00:01:31.466
This is broken.

30
00:01:31.466 --> 00:01:33.433
That means he is not of good quality either.

31
00:01:33.466 --> 00:01:36.000
This crap is worthless to me.

32
00:01:36.666 --> 00:01:38.600
You trash

33
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Iron powder blue fat man built-in 100,000 blood bank

34
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.166
Can play almost any format in the world

35
00:01:44.166 --> 00:01:46.100
Take it out with this design number program

36
00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:47.433
Waiting for the junk of demand

37
00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:48.466
Can you compare?

38
00:01:48.466 --> 00:01:50.200
But Xiaoxue's classmates can dance

39
00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.800
Fatty Blue can be a repeater, can you compare?

40
00:01:52.866 --> 00:01:54.666
But Xiaoxue's classmates can dance

41
00:01:54.666 --> 00:01:56.700
Fatty Blue can teach children to learn foreign languages

42
00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.400
Are you comparable to this garbage?

43
00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.566
But Xiaoxue's classmates learn to dance

44
00:02:00.566 --> 00:02:02.166
Can you stop dancing if you are obedient?

45
00:02:02.166 --> 00:02:02.800
OK.

46
00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:04.400
Xiaoxue beat your blue fat man away

47
00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:05.866
And we had a little dance.
