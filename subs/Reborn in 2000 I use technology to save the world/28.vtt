00:00:01.266 --> 00:00:02.600
Don't shoot FireEye

2
00:00:03.966 --> 00:00:05.966
Who is this? How did he break in?

3
00:00:05.966 --> 00:00:07.333
The person who hurt was Ichiro Okamoto

4
00:00:07.333 --> 00:00:08.900
Famous scientist in the sword country

5
00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:11.000
Swordsmanship in many fields of technology

6
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.500
I heard he's a senior professor at the Island Academy of Sciences

7
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.500
He also held important positions at Mitsubishi Heavy Industries

8
00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:16.100
and

9
00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:18.800
Or the lead designer of this lower bunk phone?

10
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:19.500
So awesome

11
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:20.200
Overbearing teacher

12
00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.600
He is the president of the famous Island Academy of Sciences

13
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.066
Nobel Prize Winner Saburo Koqun

14
00:00:25.066 --> 00:00:26.900
Wow, that's awesome.

15
00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:29.400
Mr. Zhang Ben, you are finally here

16
00:00:29.533 --> 00:00:32.100
Breeze, you can protect us

17
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:33.966
Can you protect Mr. Gen?

18
00:00:33.966 --> 00:00:36.700
Shut up you picked up trash hi

19
00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.200
Mr. Chen's island country is based on global skills

20
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.433
Micro-data can achieve 70% accuracy

21
00:00:42.566 --> 00:00:46.066
And you can actually predict global natural disasters

22
00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.200
Isn't that funny? It's funny.

23
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.766
I'm talking about your insights.

24
00:00:50.766 --> 00:00:52.133
And your little monkey life

25
00:00:52.133 --> 00:00:53.366
Hahahahaha

26
00:00:53.366 --> 00:00:55.900
Fatty Dangben is an expert in Douguo

27
00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:57.166
How dare you talk to him like that

28
00:00:57.166 --> 00:00:59.100
Who wouldn't?

29
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.066
If you have the ability, you can predict and predict

30
00:01:01.066 --> 00:01:02.100
Why not?

31
00:01:02.533 --> 00:01:04.366
Moxie, trust me.

32
00:01:04.933 --> 00:01:07.800
Of course, Dad, I trust you too.

33
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.933
Let's predict now

34
00:01:09.933 --> 00:01:12.166
Then Dad showed them

35
00:01:12.166 --> 00:01:14.266
What a crazy family

36
00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.200
Ordinary weather ahead can also predict natural disasters

37
00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:18.133
How is that possible?

38
00:01:18.133 --> 00:01:19.366
Let's forget it, yeah?

39
00:01:19.366 --> 00:01:20.900
The Chinese satellite system is not yet complete

40
00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:22.566
Now this data is very hard to collect.

41
00:01:22.566 --> 00:01:26.466
Forward, obviously these guys are a lot more sober than you are

42
00:01:26.466 --> 00:01:28.133
Hurry up and predict ahead

43
00:01:28.133 --> 00:01:29.433
Why not?

44
00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:30.800
Why not?
