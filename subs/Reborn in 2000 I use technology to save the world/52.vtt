1
00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:01.533
Then I'd like to see

2
00:00:01.533 --> 00:00:03.266
You can help us in the Chinese scientific community

3
00:00:03.266 --> 00:00:04.800
What loss?

4
00:00:04.866 --> 00:00:06.533
This old man in this island country is so arrogant

5
00:00:06.533 --> 00:00:07.933
It's our fault that we lie

6
00:00:07.933 --> 00:00:08.966
But you can't rise to

7
00:00:08.966 --> 00:00:10.500
The level of the Chinese scientific community

8
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.266
Isn't that bullying?

9
00:00:12.266 --> 00:00:13.866
My dad didn't lie

10
00:00:13.866 --> 00:00:15.800
My dad is a great scientist

11
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.366
Chief Engineer

12
00:00:17.533 --> 00:00:18.500
big scientist

13
00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:19.700
Chief Engineer

14
00:00:19.866 --> 00:00:21.566
Joke the police

15
00:00:21.666 --> 00:00:23.500
Don't think we didn't cross you.

16
00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:25.566
You are just a member of the Chinese Academy of Sciences

17
00:00:25.566 --> 00:00:27.533
A little researcher

18
00:00:27.533 --> 00:00:29.233
What a moral turpitude

19
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.166
He even lied to his own daughter

20
00:00:31.166 --> 00:00:32.966
A little researcher.

21
00:00:32.966 --> 00:00:34.800
He actually said he was the chief engineer

22
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:35.766
Just ridiculous

23
00:00:35.766 --> 00:00:39.400
Parents, today you have to apologize and apologize.

24
00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.266
Apologize if you don't apologize

25
00:00:41.266 --> 00:00:44.400
Runway, see what you can do with me, pro-French

26
00:00:44.533 --> 00:00:45.400
Do you believe it or not?

27
00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:45.966
I say a word

28
00:00:45.966 --> 00:00:48.333
Get you out of the Chinese Academy of Sciences

29
00:00:48.333 --> 00:00:50.933
Make you famous in the Chinese science and technology circle

30
00:00:50.933 --> 00:00:52.966
That's right, our teacher.

31
00:00:52.966 --> 00:00:55.166
Meet your chairperson Le of Huaguo Investment

32
00:00:55.166 --> 00:00:56.133
Just a word from him

33
00:00:56.133 --> 00:00:59.066
I can get you out of the Chinese Academy of Sciences obediently

34
00:00:59.133 --> 00:01:00.600
Happy Children of China Investment

35
00:01:00.666 --> 00:01:01.900
This is a grown-up

36
00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:03.333
As expected of a Nobel Prize winner

37
00:01:03.333 --> 00:01:04.533
Sure enough, his hands and eyes are in the sky

38
00:01:04.533 --> 00:01:07.066
I'm afraid this kid mentioned the steel plate

39
00:01:07.133 --> 00:01:07.966
Breeze

40
00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.500
Le Dong is a big shot rated by Director Li

41
00:01:10.733 --> 00:01:13.366
You won't really be famous by the Academy of Sciences, will you?

42
00:01:13.366 --> 00:01:16.466
I'm afraid not to mention a chairperson

43
00:01:16.666 --> 00:01:18.666
The president of the Chinese Academy of Sciences

44
00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:20.200
You can't get rid of me

45
00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.033
Arrogant
