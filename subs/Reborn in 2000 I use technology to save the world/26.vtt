00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:02.966
Qin Feng has already done it, don't compare anymore

2
00:00:02.966 --> 00:00:03.700
Yeah.

3
00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:07.200
The judge's grandfather said that we have already won

4
00:00:07.266 --> 00:00:08.133
Why not compare

5
00:00:08.133 --> 00:00:09.700
Don't fight for steamed buns

6
00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:11.766
I just want those traitors to know

7
00:00:11.766 --> 00:00:14.633
Our country is no worse than any other country

8
00:00:14.766 --> 00:00:16.266
Who do you think has sold thieves?

9
00:00:16.266 --> 00:00:17.500
I'll say whoever draws first

10
00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:18.866
Hello Tianyi

11
00:00:18.866 --> 00:00:20.166
Please pay attention to your words and deeds

12
00:00:20.166 --> 00:00:21.333
This is the Science and Technology Association

13
00:00:21.333 --> 00:00:23.000
Not the breeze of the academic office

14
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.200
I'd like to see it

15
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.866
How did your broken phone talk in the water?

16
00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:29.600
Who wouldn't brag?

17
00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:32.733
Don't put your phone in the water for a while and stop cooking.

18
00:00:32.733 --> 00:00:34.266
Tell me about it.

19
00:00:34.266 --> 00:00:36.500
If your phone can talk in water

20
00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.500
I'll do a handstand for you and wash your hair.

21
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:39.700
Yeah, never heard of it.

22
00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:41.300
Which company produces mobile phones that are waterproof?

23
00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.100
Yes, let alone a domestic company.

24
00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.333
Even foreign high-tech mobile phone companies

25
00:00:45.333 --> 00:00:46.433
Neither will this technology

26
00:00:48.133 --> 00:00:48.933
Ah!

27
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.766
Breeze, please begin your performance

28
00:00:52.766 --> 00:00:55.833
I'd rather see how you lose

29
00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:04.366
Oh, dear.

30
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.600
Hahahahaha

31
00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.400
Black screen, black screen, black screen, hahahaha.

32
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.300
Qingfeng, didn't you say your phone is waterproof?

33
00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.266
This is so urgent.

34
00:01:21.166 --> 00:01:23.066
Dad will brag

35
00:01:23.133 --> 00:01:24.266
What's the hurry?

36
00:01:24.266 --> 00:01:25.833
This is called the screen saver, which automatically turns off the screen.

37
00:01:25.966 --> 00:01:27.900
Classmate called me
