00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.300
Well, Zhang Zi, your suggestion is very different.

2
00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:05.400
Mr. Xiaojuan can't do it.

3
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:06.800
Mr. Xiaojuan, Director Li

4
00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:09.333
Volcanic engineering is a key project in our country

5
00:00:09.333 --> 00:00:10.966
Don't give up so easily!

6
00:00:10.966 --> 00:00:12.300
Dean Li goes

7
00:00:12.566 --> 00:00:13.500
You don't give up

8
00:00:13.666 --> 00:00:15.700
How do you predict volcanic eruptions?

9
00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:18.066
If your Hua country thinks such outrageous things

10
00:00:18.066 --> 00:00:19.866
Missing the opportunity for the rise of technology

11
00:00:19.866 --> 00:00:21.500
What a pity!

12
00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.200
If the effect is lost because of you

13
00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.466
Then you are the sinner of the whole country, the breeze

14
00:00:26.466 --> 00:00:27.966
You're ashamed of yourself

15
00:00:27.966 --> 00:00:30.500
They also lose face in front of their international friends

16
00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:31.466
It's hopeless

17
00:00:31.466 --> 00:00:33.500
Master, what are you still doing?

18
00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.900
Why don't you apologize to Mr. Xiao Quan quickly?

19
00:00:36.766 --> 00:00:38.500
What does the breeze say?

20
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.100
Money is always either me or you go first

21
00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.333
The volcano hasn't erupted yet.

22
00:00:43.333 --> 00:00:44.633
Why are you leaving?

23
00:00:46.466 --> 00:00:47.900
Please be quiet

24
00:00:48.066 --> 00:00:49.766
And the last four minutes

25
00:00:49.866 --> 00:00:51.566
The island's volcano is about to erupt

26
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.766
Don't you even have the last 4 minutes?

27
00:00:53.766 --> 00:00:54.866
Can't you wait?

28
00:00:54.866 --> 00:00:56.866
Struggling until now

29
00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.400
How dare you chase after brave

30
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.533
Am I being stubborn?

31
00:01:00.533 --> 00:01:02.800
You can see in 4 minutes

32
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.666
King, do you dare to make a bet with me?

33
00:01:05.966 --> 00:01:07.433
Bet on it

34
00:01:07.966 --> 00:01:09.933
If the fire does not erupt

35
00:01:09.933 --> 00:01:11.766
You represent the Huabo scientific community

36
00:01:11.966 --> 00:01:13.800
Roll at my knife drum and cut

37
00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.900
What if the fire erupts?

38
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Then I represent the knife and bone science community

39
00:01:18.333 --> 00:01:21.566
Roll the flower bone and cut the knife

40
00:01:21.566 --> 00:01:22.766
It's a deal.
