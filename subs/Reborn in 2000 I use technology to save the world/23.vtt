1
00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.166
That is.

2
00:00:01.166 --> 00:00:03.700
The most important function of a cell phone is to make calls

3
00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:06.666
What's the use of a phone screen that big?

4
00:00:06.666 --> 00:00:07.500
bells and whistles

5
00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:12.100
I just think the screen looks good.

6
00:00:12.266 --> 00:00:15.100
It might break with a touch.

7
00:00:15.766 --> 00:00:17.666
You are clearly looking for trouble on purpose

8
00:00:17.666 --> 00:00:19.933
Mengxue, what I said is true.

9
00:00:19.933 --> 00:00:22.300
Shouldn't this phone be sturdy and hard to use?

10
00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.233
You can't supply it when you buy it back, right?

11
00:00:24.266 --> 00:00:25.500
This is also very true.

12
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.700
Exactly. It should be.

13
00:00:28.266 --> 00:00:29.066
everyone

14
00:00:29.366 --> 00:00:31.533
As a practitioner in the mobile phone industry

15
00:00:31.533 --> 00:00:33.000
I hope that everyone's eyes

16
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.166
You can put it in the long run.

17
00:00:34.166 --> 00:00:36.600
In fact, mobile phones are not just for making calls

18
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:37.500
In the future

19
00:00:37.566 --> 00:00:40.033
Its functional properties can be more extensive

20
00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:41.700
In a more diverse setting

21
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.866
He could be the end point of intelligence

22
00:00:43.866 --> 00:00:46.633
He can not only make phone calls but also listen to music

23
00:00:46.733 --> 00:00:48.266
Watch movies and trade stocks

24
00:00:48.466 --> 00:00:50.300
It can even be your wallet

25
00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:51.866
Hey stop stop stop stop

26
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:55.166
Tell me what's strong about your mobile phone.

27
00:00:55.166 --> 00:00:56.266
Durable Not Durable

28
00:00:56.333 --> 00:00:57.666
Can you smash walnuts?

29
00:00:57.966 --> 00:00:59.700
What is a walnut?

30
00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:00.600
come

31
00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:02.233
power drill

32
00:01:02.866 --> 00:01:03.800
On the drill

33
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:05.600
electric drill

34
00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:07.533
come

35
00:01:12.166 --> 00:01:16.500
Qingfeng, you don't want to use an electric drill to drill your phone, do you?

36
00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.533
Breeze Fox can't take it at all

37
00:01:18.533 --> 00:01:20.100
Stop it

38
00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.933
Dad is so ugly, take this kid crazy

39
00:01:22.933 --> 00:01:23.700
I haven't seen it yet.

40
00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.700
Which kind of glass can withstand an electric drill?

41
00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.866
I'd like to see how finished his phone is

42
00:01:29.366 --> 00:01:31.266
Then open your eyes

43
00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.366
So here we are.
