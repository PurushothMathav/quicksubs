00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:01.666
Ouch.

2
00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.300
Isn't this our great scientist Qin Feng?

3
00:00:05.466 --> 00:00:07.066
What a great scientist

4
00:00:07.066 --> 00:00:08.600
He is a liar

5
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:09.466
Qin Feng

6
00:00:09.466 --> 00:00:11.566
I thought you were going to be honest and shrunk

7
00:00:11.566 --> 00:00:14.400
Turtle, I didn't expect you to dare to come here today

8
00:00:15.533 --> 00:00:16.333
Envelope

9
00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.366
They brought a robot from the island country

10
00:00:18.366 --> 00:00:21.000
Smash the venue today's press conference

11
00:00:21.733 --> 00:00:22.600
Don't worry.

12
00:00:22.866 --> 00:00:25.366
Today's press conference will definitely be held normally.

13
00:00:25.566 --> 00:00:26.766
Held normally

14
00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:27.533
brother-in-law

15
00:00:27.533 --> 00:00:30.366
You want to hold a press conference with a broken phone

16
00:00:30.466 --> 00:00:31.666
wishful thinking

17
00:00:31.766 --> 00:00:34.066
Didn't you say that the technology of our island country

18
00:00:34.066 --> 00:00:35.500
Why don't you France?

19
00:00:35.533 --> 00:00:37.300
Do you have a robot?

20
00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:38.100
Hey

21
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.900
The technology that passes by is definitely not comparable to that of island countries

22
00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:43.266
How is it possible to have such cutting-edge technology?

23
00:00:43.266 --> 00:00:45.933
Hey, gorgeous, there's not even a robot.

24
00:00:45.933 --> 00:00:48.066
What do you use to prove his technological content?

25
00:00:48.066 --> 00:00:51.200
If you want me to see this release cabinet, don't open it

26
00:00:51.333 --> 00:00:53.000
It's just a robot.

27
00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.666
Who said we didn't?

28
00:00:54.966 --> 00:00:56.100
Ouch.

29
00:00:56.866 --> 00:00:57.666
Breeze

30
00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:59.800
Where do we have any robots?

31
00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.733
Don't talk nonsense, you heard it

32
00:01:01.733 --> 00:01:03.400
He didn't have any.

33
00:01:03.566 --> 00:01:06.200
Diffin, your wife told you all about you

34
00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:09.700
No, what did you say back?

35
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:10.966
A mobile phone company

36
00:01:10.966 --> 00:01:13.200
How is it possible to develop any robots?

37
00:01:13.266 --> 00:01:14.900
It seems that today's press conference

38
00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:16.566
I'm afraid that won't work out.

39
00:01:17.266 --> 00:01:19.866
Striker, did you hear what everyone said?

40
00:01:19.866 --> 00:01:21.566
Since there are no robots

41
00:01:21.566 --> 00:01:26.000
I think you can cancel this press conference, hahahaha.

42
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.466
Military, if you kneel now

43
00:01:29.466 --> 00:01:32.733
An apology to the entire scientific community on this island

44
00:01:32.733 --> 00:01:34.633
I might consider

45
00:01:34.666 --> 00:01:37.333
Let you continue to hold the release planning, eh?

46
00:01:37.333 --> 00:01:39.566
It depends on who kneels first

47
00:01:39.666 --> 00:01:41.066
Xiaoxue
