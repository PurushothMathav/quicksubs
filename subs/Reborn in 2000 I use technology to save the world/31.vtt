00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:02.433
There are multiple rainbows.

2
00:00:02.933 --> 00:00:03.766
You see?

3
00:00:03.766 --> 00:00:04.766
What the striker said is true

4
00:00:04.766 --> 00:00:06.500
And there were multiple rainbows.

5
00:00:06.533 --> 00:00:07.566
And this lot of birds

6
00:00:07.566 --> 00:00:08.900
Is there really a hurricane?

7
00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:09.966
How is that possible?

8
00:00:09.966 --> 00:00:10.933
What should I do?

9
00:00:10.933 --> 00:00:12.466
Maybe 5 minutes

10
00:00:12.466 --> 00:00:14.866
I'll take you away from Giant Peak in a while with the show

11
00:00:15.133 --> 00:00:17.733
The monk can walk and still hit the glass

12
00:00:17.733 --> 00:00:20.066
Isn't bird-shaped glass a normal thing?

13
00:00:20.066 --> 00:00:22.500
I just said that these multiple rainbows

14
00:00:22.533 --> 00:00:23.500
Hot weather

15
00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:24.633
seawater transpiration

16
00:00:24.666 --> 00:00:26.200
Light refracts into a rainbow

17
00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.100
This is something we can't argue about

18
00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:28.766
Do you know

19
00:00:28.766 --> 00:00:31.466
This is something you can learn in elementary school textbooks

20
00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.266
You don't know that, do you?

21
00:00:33.366 --> 00:00:37.333
Mr. Gangamoto made my hair die, hahaha

22
00:00:37.333 --> 00:00:40.066
Damn, we've all been deceived by this guy.

23
00:00:40.066 --> 00:00:40.666
Breeze

24
00:00:40.666 --> 00:00:42.933
You can deceive ordinary people with this trick

25
00:00:42.933 --> 00:00:45.666
Trying to deceive Mr. Gangamoto is simply delusional

26
00:00:45.666 --> 00:00:47.300
Stay if you want to die

27
00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:48.866
Let's go, no way

28
00:00:48.866 --> 00:00:50.466
Wait, you can go if you want.

29
00:00:50.466 --> 00:00:52.566
Sign me the gorgeous sale agreement

30
00:00:54.366 --> 00:00:56.366
There's going to be a hurricane here in 2 minutes

31
00:00:56.366 --> 00:00:58.666
Deng Mengran, if you want to die, you can stay here

32
00:00:58.666 --> 00:01:00.800
What the hell are we going for a hurricane?

33
00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.300
Qin Feng still dares to talk nonsense

34
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.433
I'd like to see what hurricanes are there today

35
00:01:08.533 --> 00:01:10.033
The hurricane is really coming.
