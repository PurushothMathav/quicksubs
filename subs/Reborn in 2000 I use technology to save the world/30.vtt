00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.666
Just take it when you see it.

2
00:00:01.666 --> 00:00:04.066
Yes, being targeted by the big scientists of the island country

3
00:00:04.066 --> 00:00:05.800
Isn't this a big trouble?

4
00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:08.100
I don't have time for this.

5
00:00:08.266 --> 00:00:09.133
Hurricane is coming soon

6
00:00:09.133 --> 00:00:10.800
Let's hurry up

7
00:00:12.166 --> 00:00:13.133
You can go if you want.

8
00:00:13.133 --> 00:00:15.366
Sign me the gorgeous sale agreement

9
00:00:15.566 --> 00:00:18.366
Qingfeng, it's not too late for you to sign now

10
00:00:18.366 --> 00:00:20.733
Wait a minute, after we completely debunk it

11
00:00:20.733 --> 00:00:24.200
Your shares are worth a dollar

12
00:00:24.333 --> 00:00:25.500
You robbers

13
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:28.466
10 minutes left

14
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.100
I'm afraid it's too late to go now.

15
00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:31.500
There should be a basement there

16
00:00:31.733 --> 00:00:33.833
You should be able to hide in a while

17
00:00:34.133 --> 00:00:36.966
Ok then I'll stay today

18
00:00:37.066 --> 00:00:39.933
See how you expose me everyone knows

19
00:00:39.933 --> 00:00:43.200
There's always thunder before a hurricane.

20
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.300
Windy and rainy

21
00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:45.933
The sea is rough

22
00:00:45.933 --> 00:00:46.966
Lost sand

23
00:00:46.966 --> 00:00:48.566
But look outside.

24
00:00:48.566 --> 00:00:50.466
There are signs of light rain

25
00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:51.866
It really is sunny.

26
00:00:51.866 --> 00:00:53.633
So I bet on the enemy

27
00:00:53.766 --> 00:00:56.333
He also said that there could be no hurricane at all

28
00:00:56.333 --> 00:00:57.933
I only know one but not the other

29
00:00:57.933 --> 00:00:59.600
How dare you get an axe in this class

30
00:00:59.733 --> 00:01:01.600
Okamoto, what you just said

31
00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.133
It's all just part of the intention

32
00:01:04.133 --> 00:01:06.666
But did you know that before the hurricane

33
00:01:06.666 --> 00:01:08.766
A large number of animal abnormalities may occur

34
00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.233
This includes a lot of birds gathering to fly together

35
00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:13.933
Maybe even see

36
00:01:13.933 --> 00:01:15.700
Rare multiple rainbows

37
00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.000
Of course I know.

38
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.733
But come up and see what animals are there

39
00:01:19.733 --> 00:01:21.666
Where is the rainbow in the shade?

40
00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.966
Live to see more rainbows

41
00:01:23.966 --> 00:01:27.100
How can there be a lot of birds flying multiple rainbows?

42
00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:28.900
This is complete nonsense.
