00:00:04.133 --> 00:00:06.066
God what kind of glass is this

2
00:00:06.066 --> 00:00:08.300
The gold man who was drilled by the electric drill was unharmed

3
00:00:10.866 --> 00:00:13.033
I have never seen glass of this material.

4
00:00:13.166 --> 00:00:15.666
Come on, come on, take a look, take a look, hey, hey

5
00:00:15.666 --> 00:00:16.466
Be careful

6
00:00:16.466 --> 00:00:17.266
You look at me

7
00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.266
Don't take it, don't go

8
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.600
Be careful, be careful

9
00:00:23.166 --> 00:00:25.700
I didn't expect this phone screen to be so strong

10
00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:28.266
Yeah, it's so accepting. Wow.

11
00:00:28.266 --> 00:00:31.533
Dad's phone call is so powerful

12
00:00:31.533 --> 00:00:33.366
No wonder Qingfeng said before

13
00:00:33.366 --> 00:00:36.200
The lower bunk mobile phone smashing walnuts is garbage.

14
00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:37.766
How is that possible?

15
00:00:37.766 --> 00:00:39.766
How can there be glass that can withstand the force of an electric drill?

16
00:00:39.766 --> 00:00:41.366
Measure the breeze

17
00:00:41.766 --> 00:00:43.166
There must be something wrong with this drill

18
00:00:43.166 --> 00:00:44.100
How dare you cheat?

19
00:00:44.266 --> 00:00:47.300
What should I do in full view of Hu Tianyi?

20
00:00:47.366 --> 00:00:50.433
I think you can't afford to lose.

21
00:00:50.466 --> 00:00:51.266
Zhuowei

22
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:52.500
This phone

23
00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:55.266
What is used is the latest development

24
00:00:55.366 --> 00:00:57.900
Environmentally friendly aluminum silicon tempered glass

25
00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:01.400
Its apocalyptic hardness has reached level 10

26
00:01:01.466 --> 00:01:04.566
Level 10 What apocalyptic hardness level 10

27
00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.366
The hardest diamond in nature

28
00:01:06.366 --> 00:01:08.933
The hardness of the apocalypse is only level 10.

29
00:01:08.933 --> 00:01:10.733
Professor Liu, you are right

30
00:01:10.733 --> 00:01:13.100
The hardness of diamonds is indeed very high

31
00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.900
But he also has a green star

32
00:01:15.966 --> 00:01:18.566
So he can't resist you.

33
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.566
And the screen of the phone I developed

34
00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.933
Its hardness and slip resistance

35
00:01:23.933 --> 00:01:25.366
And it resists gravity.

36
00:01:25.366 --> 00:01:27.866
Have reached the world's top level

37
00:01:28.133 --> 00:01:29.533
The most important point is

38
00:01:29.533 --> 00:01:30.733
This phone screen

39
00:01:30.733 --> 00:01:33.666
The light transmittance of its glass is also very strong

40
00:01:33.866 --> 00:01:35.466
There is also anti-blue light function

41
00:01:35.966 --> 00:01:38.266
If you use this phone for a long time

42
00:01:38.333 --> 00:01:41.000
It will not produce the effect of eye fatigue.

43
00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:42.800
What Qiu Feng said is true

44
00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:43.866
It's all true.

45
00:01:43.866 --> 00:01:46.433
This phone screen is 10,000 times bigger than the bottom bunk cow

46
00:01:46.733 --> 00:01:49.200
Yes, yes, yes, hey.

47
00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:50.133
This glass

48
00:01:50.133 --> 00:01:52.266
It has reached the world's most advanced level

49
00:01:52.266 --> 00:01:52.933
No.

50
00:01:52.933 --> 00:01:55.066
This glass has surpassed the world's most advanced

51
00:01:55.066 --> 00:01:56.466
I crossed the level

52
00:01:56.466 --> 00:01:59.566
Technology is taking off in glass R & amp; D.

53
00:01:59.766 --> 00:02:00.733
What is glass?

54
00:02:00.733 --> 00:02:02.966
That phone is a piece of craftsmanship.

55
00:02:02.966 --> 00:02:03.366
No.

56
00:02:03.366 --> 00:02:06.000
It's a high-tech product across the ages.

57
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.733
Ok ok ok ok

58
00:02:07.733 --> 00:02:08.966
Great, great.

59
00:02:08.966 --> 00:02:10.300
It's incredible.
