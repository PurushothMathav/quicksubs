00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:10.300
So

3
00:00:11.933 --> 00:00:12.733

4
00:00:20.133 --> 00:00:23.366
Ouch my brother oops oops

Run carefully

6
00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.100
Mom, it's so windy

7
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.700
There is a real hurricane

8
00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:50.266
Fortunately, Mr. Iron brought us here

9
00:00:50.266 --> 00:00:52.066
Otherwise we're all done, yeah?

10
00:00:52.066 --> 00:00:54.633
If it were you, we would all be dead

00:00:54.733 --> 00:00:55.866
Thank you thank you sir thank you sir thank you thank you

12
00:00:55.866 --> 00:00:56.666
Thank you, sir.

13
00:00:56.666 --> 00:00:58.066
You're welcome in a hurry, you're welcome.

14
00:00:58.066 --> 00:01:00.200
Qingfeng, I'm sorry.

15
00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:03.433
I misunderstood you before, Dad, I'm sorry.

16
00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.666
You won't be angry with Yaoyao, will you?

17
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.300
How could I blame Yaoyao?

18
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.033
I love you too late

19
00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.800
Hey, what about my mom and Mengran?

20
00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:13.966
They stand over there

21
00:01:14.766 --> 00:01:18.366
Ouch, my waist, my waist.

22
00:01:18.366 --> 00:01:19.200
Ouch.

23
00:01:20.166 --> 00:01:21.066
Here's my leg.

24
00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:23.400
My waist.

25
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.833
My leg! My leg!

26
00:01:26.866 --> 00:01:27.666
Ah!

27
00:01:28.133 --> 00:01:28.933
Ah!

28
00:01:31.766 --> 00:01:33.733
This crap research phone

29
00:01:33.733 --> 00:01:36.100
You can't really predict natural disasters, can you?

30
00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:37.566
You bet.

31
00:01:37.566 --> 00:01:38.400
Otherwise

32
00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.900
How does he know when a hurricane is coming?

33
00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:42.566
Ouch my waist

34
00:01:42.566 --> 00:01:43.666
How is that possible?

35
00:01:43.666 --> 00:01:48.000
A junk phone can not only be waterproof, bolt-proof and dustproof

36
00:01:48.166 --> 00:01:50.100
It can actually predict likes

37
00:01:50.133 --> 00:01:51.900
The technology content of this design

38
00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:53.366
Definitely cross-generational

39
00:01:53.366 --> 00:01:55.133
By the way, when will this mobile phone be mass-produced?

40
00:01:55.133 --> 00:01:56.800
Be sure to give us some orders then.

41
00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:57.366
Yes!

42
00:01:57.366 --> 00:01:59.133
Please give us a chance to cooperate.

43
00:01:59.133 --> 00:02:00.266
We don't bring labor costs

44
00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:01.566
We will bear all the costs ourselves.

45
00:02:01.566 --> 00:02:02.600
We don't want shares anymore

46
00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.766
Besides, I'll give Gorgeous 5 million math

47
00:02:04.766 --> 00:02:07.166

We are willing to cooperate.

51
00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.133
We have an opportunity to invest.

52
00:02:12.133 --> 00:02:12.800
Ladies and gentlemen

53
00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.833
You shut up like they're useless

54
00:02:20.066 --> 00:02:21.200
Hahaha

55
00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.500
What is this for?

56
00:02:26.133 --> 00:02:28.400
Mr. Chen's predecessor gave me a chance to cooperate
