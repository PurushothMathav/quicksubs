00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.600
Dean, Chief Teacher Qin, are you alright?

2
00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:05.466
Is everything okay?

3
00:00:06.066 --> 00:00:08.166
Oh, that's unfortunate. That's lucky.

4
00:00:08.733 --> 00:00:10.966
I heard today that you went to Haicheng with your lover.

5
00:00:10.966 --> 00:00:13.166
What technology selection did you participate in?

6
00:00:13.166 --> 00:00:15.600
There just happened to be another hurricane in Haicheng

7
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:16.866
It's really worrying.

8
00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:17.900
Dean, don't worry.

9
00:00:17.933 --> 00:00:18.900
I am lucky

10
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.366
It's alright dean

11
00:00:20.466 --> 00:00:22.333
This phone I developed before

12
00:00:22.333 --> 00:00:23.800
Has passed my test

13
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.066
All functions are implemented

14
00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:27.500
It needs to be mass-produced now.

15
00:00:27.566 --> 00:00:29.833
We need the help of the National Academy of Sciences

16
00:00:30.533 --> 00:00:31.933
What help doesn't help?

17
00:00:31.933 --> 00:00:32.866
You remember

18
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.266
The doors of the Academy of Sciences are always open to you

19
00:00:35.266 --> 00:00:37.000
If you need any help, just say so.

20
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.933
I totally did

21
00:00:38.933 --> 00:00:39.933
Right?

22
00:00:39.933 --> 00:00:42.200
When can you come back to the Academy of Sciences again?

23
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.166
Many old colleagues miss you very much.

24
00:00:44.166 --> 00:00:46.200
I want to communicate with you

25
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.100
Well, if nothing else

26
00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:49.866
I will go to Beijing tomorrow

27
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.233
Then the dean

28
00:00:51.366 --> 00:00:53.266
Please help me contact

29
00:00:53.266 --> 00:00:55.300
For experts in nuclear fusion

30
00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.800
So you want to move on to controlled fusion?

31
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.466
Yes, oops.

32
00:01:00.466 --> 00:01:02.400
And that's very labor intensive.

33
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:03.566
Material resources and bride price?

34
00:01:03.566 --> 00:01:04.566
Dean rest assured

35
00:01:04.566 --> 00:01:06.466
I have mastered the relevant technology

36
00:01:06.466 --> 00:01:08.166
You just need to smoke people.

37
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.500
Hey, that would be great. Okay.

38
00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.933
Then I will gather relevant talents overnight

39
00:01:12.933 --> 00:01:13.766
Oh, right.

40
00:01:13.766 --> 00:01:16.100
Do you want me to send a special plane to pick you up?

41
00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:17.633
Okay, no need for now.

42
00:01:18.133 --> 00:01:21.900
This time I'm going with my family. Okay. Bye

43
00:01:23.866 --> 00:01:25.900
Whose phone number is Qingfeng?

44
00:01:26.366 --> 00:01:28.466
What about the person who helped us achieve mass production of mobile phones?

45
00:01:28.566 --> 00:01:30.366
You just said you were going to the capital

46
00:01:30.566 --> 00:01:32.100
Are you going to see him?

47
00:01:32.133 --> 00:01:33.933
Yes, rest early.

48
00:01:33.933 --> 00:01:35.233
We leave tomorrow morning
