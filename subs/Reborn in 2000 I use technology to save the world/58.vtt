00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.433
By this time

2
00:00:01.466 --> 00:00:03.000
You're still playing tricks

3
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.933
Striker, you still look stubborn

4
00:00:05.933 --> 00:00:08.400
President Liu, this is our National Academy of Sciences

5
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.133
The only chief engineer?

6
00:00:10.133 --> 00:00:11.900
This is too child's play

7
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
This kind of person can do the general project of China Institute of Technology

8
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.500
Teacher is simply feasible

9
00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:17.566
Yes!

10
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:21.033
No wonder our technology in China has been lagging behind

11
00:00:21.266 --> 00:00:23.466
People who talk nonsense like this

12
00:00:23.466 --> 00:00:25.866
He is not worthy to be the president of our Chinese Academy of Sciences at all

13
00:00:25.866 --> 00:00:26.366
Engineer

14
00:00:26.366 --> 00:00:27.500
I told you

15
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.000
He is a piece of crap

16
00:00:29.266 --> 00:00:31.500
Maybe some trick

17
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.000
To deceive Dean Li?

18
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:33.866
Dean Li

19
00:00:34.166 --> 00:00:36.266
The title of chief engineer of the National Academy of Sciences

20
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.400
Too important

21
00:00:37.466 --> 00:00:39.933
We must not allow such a deceptive person

22
00:00:39.933 --> 00:00:41.066
Stolen

23
00:00:41.266 --> 00:00:42.200
Just shut up.

24
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.766
What contributions has Chief Engineer Qin made to the country?

25
00:00:44.766 --> 00:00:45.733
Don't understand at all

26
00:00:45.733 --> 00:00:47.766
What right do you have to slander him for cheating

27
00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.266
Is it deception?

28
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.366
We'll know soon enough.

29
00:00:51.366 --> 00:00:54.633
Why should Dean Li be short-sighted with these people?
