00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:00.866
Hahahahahahahahaha

2
00:00:00.866 --> 00:00:01.333
Hahahahahahaha

3
00:00:01.333 --> 00:00:02.133
Hahahahaha

4
00:00:14.366 --> 00:00:15.800
I didn't expect this trash

5
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.933
How dare you predict the time of a volcanic eruption?

6
00:00:18.933 --> 00:00:21.100
Predicting volcanic eruptions

7
00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:22.533
Also predicted 10 minutes

8
00:00:22.533 --> 00:00:24.366
Isn't this waiting to be slapped in the face?

9
00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:26.966
Mr. Koizumi is extraordinary

10
00:00:26.966 --> 00:00:28.933
Expose this liar in one fell swoop

11
00:00:28.933 --> 00:00:32.600
It seems to the police that I was really deceived by you before

12
00:00:32.733 --> 00:00:35.833
Teacher, thank you for helping me expose him

13
00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.566
What does Qin Feng have to say about doting?

14
00:00:38.566 --> 00:00:39.500
Yes!

15
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.133
The island country volcano has not erupted for hundreds of years

16
00:00:42.133 --> 00:00:43.733
How could it erupt suddenly?

17
00:00:43.733 --> 00:00:46.566
Did Chief Engineer Qin read it wrong?

18
00:00:46.933 --> 00:00:49.900
Did Miss Qin Feng make a wrong prediction?

19
00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:51.233
Yes, Chief Teacher Qin

20
00:00:51.366 --> 00:00:52.766
The island nation's volcanoes have been transformed

21
00:00:52.766 --> 00:00:54.300
It's already an extinct volcano

22
00:00:54.566 --> 00:00:55.366
dean

23
00:00:55.933 --> 00:00:58.966
Blizzard, I have absolute confidence in Xiaoxue

24
00:00:58.966 --> 00:01:00.600
I think you are domineering towards deception

25
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:01.666
Have absolute confidence

26
00:01:01.666 --> 00:01:05.166
Frog, you were slapped in the face, and you are still stubborn?

27
00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.366
Poverty if you could apologize now

28
00:01:08.366 --> 00:01:08.966
So...

29
00:01:08.966 --> 00:01:11.333
France's eligibility to participate in volcanic engineering projects

30
00:01:11.333 --> 00:01:12.866
I can still keep it.

31
00:01:12.866 --> 00:01:14.766
Haha Volcano Engineering

32
00:01:14.766 --> 00:01:17.166
Our country will definitely not participate.

33
00:01:17.366 --> 00:01:20.000
After all, I don't want our Chinese researchers to

34
00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.466
died unexpectedly

35
00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:24.800
There are still 8 minutes left

36
00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.566
The island's volcano is about to erupt

37
00:01:26.566 --> 00:01:27.833
I advise you

38
00:01:27.866 --> 00:01:30.633
Hurry up and call your relevant department

39
00:01:30.766 --> 00:01:32.366
Tell them to evacuate

40
00:01:32.366 --> 00:01:35.100
Otherwise, the consequences will be unimaginable
