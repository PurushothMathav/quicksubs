00:00:00.533 --> 00:00:01.966
Dean, oops, Chief Teacher Qin

2
00:00:01.966 --> 00:00:03.000
I'm glad you're okay.

3
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.533
If there is a three long and two short

4
00:00:04.533 --> 00:00:06.733
It will be China's greatest loss.

5
00:00:06.733 --> 00:00:09.000
Dean, I need to go to the capital as soon as possible

6
00:00:09.066 --> 00:00:10.866
I need equipment from the National Academy of Sciences

7
00:00:10.866 --> 00:00:11.800
To build a cell phone

8
00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.933
Great, Chief Qin finally looks forward to you

9
00:00:14.933 --> 00:00:16.766
I'll send the album to pick you up right away

10
00:00:16.766 --> 00:00:18.366
Ok, ASAP, don't worry.

11
00:00:18.366 --> 00:00:21.033
I promise the plane will be there in 5 minutes

12
00:00:21.733 --> 00:00:22.966
Dream snow time waits for no one

13
00:00:22.966 --> 00:00:24.300
The plane is coming to pick me up soon

14
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.200
I have to get to the National Academy of Sciences.

15
00:00:26.366 --> 00:00:27.233
Qin Feng

16
00:00:27.366 --> 00:00:29.700
We are husband and wife, is it funny for you to lie to me like this?

17
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:31.166
There's a plane to pick you up

18
00:00:31.166 --> 00:00:32.466
Mengxue, I didn't lie to you.

19
00:00:32.466 --> 00:00:34.666
I know you want to comfort me

20
00:00:34.666 --> 00:00:37.300
But there's no point in making up such a lie

21
00:00:37.333 --> 00:00:39.366
Dad don't go

22
00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.533
Today is Yaoyao's birthday

23
00:00:41.533 --> 00:00:45.133
Can you spend your birthday with Yaoyao?

24
00:00:45.133 --> 00:00:46.900
Yaoyao's father will make one

25
00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:48.700
A very powerful mobile phone as a gift for you.

26
00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:49.500
Ok?

27
00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.800
Qin Feng, are you finished?

28
00:00:52.933 --> 00:00:55.066
It's okay if you don't accompany Yaoyao in the past

29
00:00:55.066 --> 00:00:56.633
How dare you lie to him now?

30
00:00:56.666 --> 00:00:57.800
I didn't lie to you.

31
00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.200
Qin Feng, do you think you are lying to yourself?

32
00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.300
Can you create a flower-age smartphone?

33
00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:03.866
You thought you built a seismograph

34
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.866
Are you really a great scientist?

35
00:01:05.933 --> 00:01:07.400
There's a plane to pick you up

36
00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:08.400
Can you be realistic?

37
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.366
Don't miss the consequences

38
00:01:09.366 --> 00:01:10.833
What if I am?

39
00:01:12.733 --> 00:01:14.400
Sorry Mengxue

40
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.800
You give me another 7 days.

41
00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.533
I will definitely be able to build this phone

42
00:01:17.533 --> 00:01:20.066
At that time, I will take this mobile phone to save the gorgeous.

43
00:01:20.133 --> 00:01:21.900
How do you expect me to trust you?

44
00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.266
Do you know

45
00:01:23.266 --> 00:01:25.366
A cell phone goes from being involved to being fully produced

46
00:01:25.366 --> 00:01:26.900
How many departments are required to cooperate?

47
00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:28.833
You said you were not a scientist.

48
00:01:28.866 --> 00:01:31.400
Even if you are really 7 days

49
00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.400
You can't do it either

50
00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.100
Brother-in-law, I used to only think you were useless

51
00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.166
I feel like you're not motivated

52
00:01:38.533 --> 00:01:42.033
I didn't expect you to be immersed in fantasies by this time

53
00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:45.233
Even full of lies in front of children

54
00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:47.933
You have disappointed me so much.

55
00:01:47.933 --> 00:01:49.466
Moxie I Run

56
00:01:54.366 --> 00:01:55.433
The plane came to pick me up

57
00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.100
After 7 days

58
00:01:57.266 --> 00:02:00.066
I will lead the gorgeous to the peak of technology
