00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.420
It's the Guangming King who arranged my ancestors.

2
00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:07.900
Okay, in order to make the surface of the Guangming King truly biased towards the middle-class Dare Scene.

3
00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.240
In fact, the body is wide with enemy water.

4
00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:11.700
The mind does not dismantle soon

5
00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:13.320
He was an owner at the time.

6
00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.820
So you're really a traitor.

7
00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.300
If I don't fake death

8
00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.340
How can I trust you?

9
00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:22.420
Open the door for me.

10
00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.120
Death can't speak, can't you see?

11
00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:27.040
It's all part of the Pantheon plot.

12
00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:28.080
The danger is to eliminate the conspiracy.

13
00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.220
Conspiracy to kill.

14
00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:30.580
Conspiracy.

15
00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:33.540
Come here, you tell me.

16
00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.900
What your king has done to me.

17
00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.740
Which doesn't count as a return date?

18
00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:44.980
You still don't believe it after all.

19
00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:47.820
If not, how can you be fooled?

20
00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.220
That's okay.

21
00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.700
Let me see you too.

22
00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:53.340
See the great summer.

23
00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:56.020
Now you know the eyes of your brother-in-law.

24
00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.580
You don't have such good character.

25
00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:03.160
This criminal pressure plate

26
00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.100
I can even leave you with a power sentence.

27
00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:08.600
My table is not mortal, and having a clean conscience is not a sin.

28
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:13.580
It seems that this table is immortal to the end and not only welcomes him to speak directly to him.

29
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.180
But...

30
00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.100
Why don't you say, your heart is soft?

31
00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:22.620
How is that possible?

32
00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:24.460
I'm just thinking.

33
00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:27.340
What tricks were used to torture him?

34
00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.460
It'll be more fun.
