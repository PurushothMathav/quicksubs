00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.400
First time especially not begging

2
00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:03.380
I vaguely felt that something was wrong.

3
00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:05.200
Although he hides it very well.

4
00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:06.500
But this is absolutely unforgettable.

5
00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:08.980
And this time.

6
00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.100
He's too involved.

7
00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.940
It's outrageous. It shows his intentions.

8
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.900
The more he acts aloof, pitifully useless.

9
00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:18.500
It makes me even more suspicious.

10
00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:20.380
There must be a conspiracy here.

11
00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:25.880
Of course, let me find the bankrupt neighbor, because you find out a lot of things that are wrong.

12
00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:27.560
Why not give the documents to the King of Quang Lang?

13
00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:29.100
To clear up your doubts.

14
00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:30.460
The evidence is still uncertain.

15
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.100
Sending indiscriminately with full-body intent only

16
00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:34.580
Even...

17
00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.980
Some people will just think I'm buried.

18
00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:40.680
I hope you

19
00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.780
We have discovered that Quang Lang Vuong is very strict about right and wrong recently.

20
00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.100
Several times requests to meet were denied.

21
00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.880
There doesn't seem to be anything to him.

22
00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:51.940
Very good.

23
00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.460
Khai Ming, please help me arrange it.

24
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:55.780
I want to make an appointment with the swordsman.

25
00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.900
Seriously, what do you mean?

26
00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:01.960
Now I have a plan.

27
00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.980
Becoming an enemy has become a well-known fact.

28
00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.840
Maybe take this opportunity to pretend to cooperate with him.

29
00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:09.980
He'll lead me to the organization behind the scenes.

30
00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.580
To find the real behind-the-scenes decoration.

31
00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:14.620
Please rest assured.

32
00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.180
I'll arrange it right away.

33
00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:19.440
The week doesn't exist.

34
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.120
Wait until I find the real clock behind the scenes.

35
00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:24.820
I see what else you're saying.
