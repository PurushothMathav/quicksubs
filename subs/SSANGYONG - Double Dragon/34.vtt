1
00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:02.140
You told them to do that.

2
00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:05.420
It's not reinforcements, we volunteered.

3
00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:08.200
Some of us were injured in an accident.

4
00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:10.020
Everyone has a disability.

5
00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:11.720
No one wants

6
00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:13.980
The reinforcements were determined to take us in.

7
00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:18.140
Every month in addition to salary and bonuses

8
00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:20.120
Send us consolation money.

9
00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:21.200
But we know.

10
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:22.100
This money.

11
00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:26.100
It's all subsidized by private reinforcements.

12
00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.500
If there are no reinforcements

13
00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:30.640
Who cares about us?

14
00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.100
Who cares about our death?

15
00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.660
Our loved ones.

16
00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.900
How to live like this

17
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:40.740
Right.

18
00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:44.720
I broke an arm.

19
00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:46.640
My mother is very ill.

20
00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:47.820
Over the years.

21
00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:50.740
They're all reinforcements helping us at the flower wall.

22
00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:51.920
Ask.

23
00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.100
Good people like this.

24
00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.180
So sympathy for the good boss of the subordinates.

25
00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.880
How can you collude with the enemy?

26
00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.560
Why betray your brother?

27
00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:03.340
Right?
