00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.220
The Army Joins the Pantheon

2
00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:05.620
Then there are some things that don't need to be hidden.

3
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.420
Let's go.

4
00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:12.760
You, you are the general next to my boss.

5
00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:14.820
Huyen Yu, are you not dead?

6
00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.340
Ha Tam Sword Electric Lake

7
00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:21.860
Huyen Yu regardless was a bright light that my Pantheon placed next to the Nine Cups Circle.

8
00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:25.680
It's very convenient for me that Pantheon got Qin Fang in time.

9
00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.100
That day I lied to the trust of the Infernal Earth.

10
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:30.660
If I don't

11
00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.660
How can you trust your brother or sister?

12
00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.460
He will be his own assassin.

13
00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:37.880
So that's it.

14
00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:39.700
Half temple plot abyss

15
00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:40.860
Admire

16
00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.980
I'm afraid it's empty.

17
00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.720
You also have many wives in the royal court.

18
00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:48.820
Good.

19
00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:53.920
But, this will have to wait for you to scold me like a camel before you can tell you.

20
00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.020
That's right, I just joined.

21
00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.760
You need to show your sincerity first.

22
00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.700
What is the store going to do next?

23
00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:08.360
The next step we'd like you to take is to use your daytime reinforcements position.

24
00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:09.420
If you're not angry

25
00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:13.180
What's going on?

26
00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.580
This time I really want to see my good brother off.

27
00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:18.820
Then I'll wait.

28
00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.020
Expect good news from reinforcements.

29
00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.840
Don't worry, cooperate with the reinforcements.

30
00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.900
They're all self-contained reinforcements.

31
00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:29.760
Yes.

32
00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:31.700
Then do it first.

33
00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.140
Under the tree seen in the Pantheon
