00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.060
So...

2
00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:04.180
He said someone married the newspaper.

3
00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:06.140
That means you.

4
00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:08.040
If I don't stand up

5
00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.080
Does anyone under this day dare to criticize you, King of the dead?

6
00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:14.840
Li Buan, you're crazy.

7
00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:16.220
For yourself.

8
00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:18.460
Accidentally fabricating allegations of slander of light

9
00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:19.320
Lies.

10
00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:24.500
That day when he forced me to get down on my knees at the birch party, spent all my family's money.

11
00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:26.620
Isn't that not sleeping for me?

12
00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.500
Have I ever had a flash of complaint?

13
00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:33.100
But what did he do to me?

14
00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.460
He invited me to take the meridian and become a scrap.

15
00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:37.580
Disadvantage if not

16
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.140
He wanted to cut me in front of everyone.

17
00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.600
Since then, I've told myself

18
00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.460
I have to get back everything I lost.

19
00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:51.460
Let him taste the taste of this white void.

20
00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:55.100
Li Buyan, did you know that all this is done online for good?

21
00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.020
I know, please give me strength.

22
00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:58.260
I don't blame you.

23
00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:03.440
But you know that behind the Chi Uy King there is a mysterious power, half-loyal to the disorderly grand conspiracy.

24
00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.420
Your sister has to make him a friend.

25
00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.300
Did you really betray the elephant?

26
00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:09.460
Betrayal

27
00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:11.740
Ha ha ha

28
00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.060
He said I betrayed him.

29
00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.880
I did my best for this warrior.

30
00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:20.820
Work hard.

31
00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.020
But what did Master do to me?

32
00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.880
When I had to admit I was a traitor

33
00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.800
Everyone condemns me.

34
00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.080
Has anyone ever stood up for me?

35
00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:32.460
Owner of the building.

36
00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:34.780
Have you ever said a word to me?

37
00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:36.460
In that case.

38
00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:41.540
What if I'm scared this summer?
