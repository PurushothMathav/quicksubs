00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.040
Did you hear that wrong?

2
00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:03.520
The King of Quang Lang forced Bach Hac Nguyen Quan to die.

3
00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:05.660
What the hell?

4
00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:07.960
Lord, what do you want to do?

5
00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:12.600
Then you can't ask him first, right, what is this Infernal Trac?

6
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.640
You messed up the White House today.

7
00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:17.000
Because you and I are brothers.

8
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.340
I'm a disaster for you.

9
00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:23.580
But you're also pushing your nose against your face.

10
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:24.800
I don't.

11
00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.620
If you were not my brother, you would be in the Mausoleum.

12
00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:32.140
Do you know you're committing a major disaster?

13
00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:34.180
Just tell me.

14
00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.980
What did I do?

15
00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.040
Ly Bu Language secretly assassinated Quang Lang king.

16
00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.500
The evidence has gone.

17
00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:47.940
Sin is the owner.

18
00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.480
What Yuan Quan assassinated Quang Lang Vuong

19
00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:54.640
It's impossible.

20
00:00:54.640 --> 00:01:00.900
Bach Loc Yuan Quan's assassination of Quang Lang Vuong was indeed harmful to astronomers, is there any misunderstanding in this?

21
00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:05.260
The words and actions you did today.

22
00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:09.800
They all identified me as the mastermind of the assault and murder case in Northern Xinjiang.

23
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.340
Your ten-year brotherhood, you don't believe me.

24
00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:17.920
How do you want me to believe you?

25
00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.200
The Northern Xinjiang Route is known only to you.

26
00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.220
Who else but you?
