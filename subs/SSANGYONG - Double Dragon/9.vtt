00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:06.840
Boss, give me some time.

2
00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:08.700
I'll investigate everything.

3
00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.180
Give you a satisfied answer

4
00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:13.240
Give you time

5
00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:15.120
Give me time to destroy the evidence.

6
00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.380
You don't want the evidence right in front of you.

7
00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:19.760
I have to believe you.

8
00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:21.020
Five years in the game

9
00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.440
Your first time on a mission.

10
00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:25.000
In an enemy ambush.

11
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.160
Thrill insurance

12
00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.040
I ran a thousand miles to save you.

13
00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:30.100
That battle.

14
00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.140
I've been stabbed three times for you.

15
00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.180
Go, don't forget me.

16
00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:59.400
Let's go together.

17
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.540
I want to die together.

18
00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.420
For the next eight years, he was isolated in the military.

19
00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:20.860
I am not afraid that I will risk my life for you.

20
00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:25.760
That year I gave you everything.

21
00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:27.440
Unserious, I tell you.

22
00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.380
You dare to use the resources of your home to support the Inhuman Trac.

23
00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.200
From now on, you will be deported by the emperor.

24
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.280
Are you kidding me?

25
00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.260
Even if it's a broken bone.

26
00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.020
I also want to help my brother.

27
00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.280
How could I have you, you son of a bitch?

28
00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.140
For you.

29
00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:48.840
Passing through fire and water

30
00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.320
Spending all the family's money.

31
00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:51.980
I've done all of this.

32
00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.380
Isn't that enough?
