00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.920
3 trillion Quang Lang kings

2
00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:06.040
Now we've lost trillions of orders.

3
00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:09.620
If Kim Thinh Bank recovers a loan of VND3 trillion

4
00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:10.780
I booked international

5
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.300
Just afraid of immediately dividing profits, bankruptcy and bankruptcy.

6
00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:17.980
But if I could give away all my family's possessions.

7
00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.860
You can't pay this loan.

8
00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:23.120
Hey.

9
00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:24.680
What?

10
00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:26.560
General Director Wang Lin

11
00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.040
Because the partner was dissolved.

12
00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:30.640
Now for a while, we can't find new partners.

13
00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.420
Now all the factories are stalled.

14
00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:33.360
The order was returned.

15
00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.260
Egret International has fallen into paralysis.

16
00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.160
Director General Chi, I'm in a serious international crisis right now.

17
00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:41.080
Song of the Day

18
00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:43.180
Think of a way.

19
00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.120
Big Brother, now Bat Lu International is under siege.

20
00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:47.520
You come down here and help me.

21
00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.120
Everything today is business.

22
00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.180
I cannot abuse my power to impose intervention.

23
00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.400
But I have expressed my support for your holding of Egret International.

24
00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.620
But if you can't solve Egret International's predicament,

25
00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:59.380
Then there's nothing I can do about it.

26
00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.140
Master, I have given up.

27
00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:07.140
There's only one way to bring Egret back.
