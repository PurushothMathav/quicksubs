00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.280
I've investigated it.

2
00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:03.840
The force behind the plaque is most likely the Pantheon.

3
00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:05.760
What Pantheon?

4
00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:08.940
Yes, they are except for Chiwewa's flag chair.

5
00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:12.120
There are many people in the army and the center of the building.

6
00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:13.620
You can go to the Pantheon.

7
00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:15.940
So my goal is to do all of this.

8
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.680
Just to stop it backstage.

9
00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.600
And the pieces they planted inside the building were completely rescued.

10
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:21.680
Absolutely.

11
00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:23.620
But I didn't expect the engagement party today.

12
00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:25.540
Your reaction will stop him.

13
00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.360
I thought it was safe.

14
00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:29.520
It's not what you think.

15
00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:33.200
The goal of my approach to Schweiwa was to completely eradicate this cancer.

16
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.900
Solve these hazards for the building once and for all.

17
00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.840
But I need your cooperation.

18
00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:40.240
What do you want me to do?

19
00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:41.820
I need you to work with me.

20
00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:43.360
Let them eat so they trust you.

21
00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.400
My two brothers have completely turned their backs on each other.

22
00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:46.760
Don't even mind hurting you

23
00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.360
So they won't have reservations in front of me

24
00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:52.640
Of course I'm going to show those arranged wives in front of me.

25
00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.500
Then we'll catch the cicadas.

26
00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:57.380
The Prince is in the back.

27
00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:58.740
Catch them all.

28
00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.420
No problem, I will try my best to cooperate with you, but

29
00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:03.780
This will make you tired and successful.

30
00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.700
Just two great generals to the temple of ten thousand gods

31
00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:08.860
I'll arrest anyone.
