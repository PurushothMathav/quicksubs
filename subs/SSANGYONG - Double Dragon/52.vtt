00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:03.920
Boss.

2
00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:07.380
Thank you.

3
00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.420
The second brother is now back in control of White Deer International.

4
00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:11.740
Power.

5
00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:15.900
I don't know what to do with my sister, the three Bac Giang assassins

6
00:00:16.159 --> 00:00:18.360
I was framed from beginning to end.

7
00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:20.460
But they were treated like that by the Red Cross.

8
00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.200
I really don't want to be bothered like that.

9
00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:27.800
That's why I want to invite you to work together to deal with the Inferno Trac.

10
00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:28.600
This one.

11
00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:31.520
No matter what you do too much.

12
00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:33.160
But he's the boss anyway.

13
00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.560
Dear, if you come back like this, IELTS must forget.

14
00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:38.020
You can't even understand this person?

15
00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.220
Just finished.

16
00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:42.460
If someone threatens his rights

17
00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:44.460
He will find a way to destroy it.

18
00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:45.660
I even have my doubts.

19
00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:50.260
Beigang Stabbed Sa Ye is an extraordinary self-directed play.

20
00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.760
The goal is to destroy me alone.

21
00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.960
No wonder Li Uy Uy often saw such a body with Trac Bu Fan.

22
00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.840
I'll think so.

23
00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:03.980
So it seems that the cage exit plan can be adjusted.

24
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:05.240
How is that possible?

25
00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:08.040
Even if the boss is too divided, he can't do that.

26
00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.500
Honey, what if you don't have anything?

27
00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.580
Dear, I can't be with you anymore.

28
00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:15.860
Let go, girl. Your play is great.

29
00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:17.460
But for me

30
00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.620
There's no need to pretend.

31
00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:20.920
What do you mean?

32
00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.900
I'm sure you've seen what's in this play.

33
00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:25.780
We'll be a little more honest.
