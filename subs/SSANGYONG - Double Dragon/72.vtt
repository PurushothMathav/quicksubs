00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:03.140
What?

2
00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:05.100
Ken pleads guilty

3
00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:07.140
Let it out

4
00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:10.500
There's a trick to finding me here.

5
00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:12.080
As long as you plead guilty.

6
00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:14.620
Can I promise you to let him go?

7
00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:15.940
Your Majesty.

8
00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:17.740
Can't plead guilty

9
00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.260
If I can keep this undefeated love

10
00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:23.340
I'd rather die than die.

11
00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.020
You don't act I don't kill

12
00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:27.940
You kill me.

13
00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.860
But I won't beg you to forgive

14
00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.220
Lock it up.

15
00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:33.420
I plead guilty.

16
00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.100
Let go.

17
00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.100
Let me go to the King.

18
00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:51.020
Grandmother's sins you don't care I let go

19
00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:53.620
Wang Shang

20
00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.260
Can leave you a full verse

21
00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.700
This is the greatest experience I can give you.

22
00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.020
I thought I would die on the battlefield one day.

23
00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.220
But I never thought about

24
00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.580
Will die in your hands
