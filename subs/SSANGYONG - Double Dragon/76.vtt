00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:01.460
Of course.

2
00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:03.340
Shop owner Anh Minh Than Vo

3
00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:07.180
Is that the kind of old person you can't compare to bold?

4
00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.720
You dare to insult the Dragon Master.

5
00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:11.500
Tiger, you're wrong about that.

6
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:13.860
He won't be the Dragon Master anymore.

7
00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.180
I advise you.

8
00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:16.720
Or recognize the crime?

9
00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:17.700
Give up the darkness.

10
00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:20.120
Otherwise, it will harm the family.

11
00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:21.720
The thief

12
00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.940
Even if he is dead, he will not pay attention to the army.

13
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:29.740
Princess, the whole body is controlled by our people.

14
00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:31.520
If you are smart

15
00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:33.440
Obediently distribute yourself.

16
00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:35.540
Don't make us do that.

17
00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:37.700
You don't believe it, don't return it too soon.

18
00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.460
Even if King Kuoling is killed by me.

19
00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:42.980
There are ten thousand Quang Lang Quan defined as Qin King

20
00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:45.180
Surrender now.

21
00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:46.960
If not, the government does not guarantee

22
00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.240
The army of Quang Lang has long been controlled by our people.

23
00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:52.600
And yesterday, day and night.

24
00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.300
There were 10,000 Quang Lang troops ahead.

25
00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.620
They have now surrounded the capital.

26
00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.300
My shrimp is gone.

27
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.940
The boss signs off.

28
00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.980
He also wants to wear the Dragon Master from La Y.

29
00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:19.900
The thief

30
00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.440
The thief.

31
00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:25.020
Please wait for the Dragon Master to be worshiped by all gods.
