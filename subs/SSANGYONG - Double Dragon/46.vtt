00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:03.820
I asked if you remember?

2
00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.900
Remember, I just told you.

3
00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:08.620
Your provocation to me.

4
00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:11.100
I'll retaliate.

5
00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:13.100
Eyes for eyes

6
00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:15.740
Now I'm going to give you a chance to admit the mistake.

7
00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:18.540
Get on your knees and apologize immediately.

8
00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.980
Or you'll die like them.

9
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:23.860
My patience is limited.

10
00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:25.780
Roses in three lives.

11
00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:27.260
Self-Suffering Consequences

12
00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:30.100
3.

13
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:32.780
2.

14
00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:35.220
1.

15
00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:41.980
Boss, I'm wrong.

16
00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:46.540
Just know it's wrong.

17
00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:49.100
Don't ever show up in front of me again.

18
00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:51.020
I don't want to.

19
00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:52.700
See you.

20
00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:01.720
What do they all look like?

21
00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:02.820
Looking at what?

22
00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:08.420
Otherwise, you will humiliate me in front of the monks.

23
00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:10.100
Make me know

24
00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:11.780
This humiliation.

25
00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.100
I can definitely return it a hundred times.

26
00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:16.480
Boss.

27
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.300
Sorry, it's Xiaoming today, I didn't do a good job.

28
00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.100
I can't believe the power of the future is so strong.

29
00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.060
What is the International Hundred Meters?

30
00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.220
He alone lost water.

31
00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:30.880
It's not all water.

32
00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:31.980
The needle can't penetrate.

33
00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.920
When did you learn to talk?

34
00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.240
The work is free.

35
00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.500
More guns and sticks

36
00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.780
I don't know you.
