00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.080
Crazy King, what do you mean?

2
00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:03.800
Today is the day when soldiers wear white.

3
00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:05.300
You told him to kneel down for the hero.

4
00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:06.560
Is it a bit unlucky?

5
00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:10.140
Unfortunately, the white deer army is a big shelf.

6
00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:11.920
Net asset value trillion

7
00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:12.980
Rich country.

8
00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:16.140
Can make the noble Sakyamuni armrest bend

9
00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.880
But you know your safety.

10
00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:23.640
Your property is my great honor to protect the country in exchange.

11
00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.980
They won, are you unfit to return?

12
00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:28.040
Keep Lord Wang.

13
00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:30.080
It's a happy day.

14
00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:32.340
Make him kneel and the King will speak.

15
00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:34.140
Where have you interjected

16
00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:37.660
Li Baiyan, are you expensive?

17
00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.200
Lord, you have gone a little too far today.

18
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.220
That's outrageous.

19
00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:42.940
Am I being excessive?

20
00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.580
It's him, Li Buyan has gold on his knee.

21
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.980
Or does he consider his own life compared to the chance of making a bad sound?

22
00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.760
King Quang Ninh, why give him such a hat?

23
00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.940
It doesn't matter, Li Bu Yan can achieve today.

24
00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.780
It is really inseparable from the efforts of the Great Xia heroes.

25
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:03.420
This time

26
00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:06.680
That one.

27
00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:08.480
His way is Bach Hac Nguyen Quan

28
00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:11.500
You're in the public eye.

29
00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.680
Your Majesty, this is too much.

30
00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:20.280
Perhaps King Quang Lang only used this way to warn the White Land Yuan Army not to forget the active mind.

31
00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.080
Fear.

32
00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.020
I hope so.

33
00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.540
Brother, the first thing I've done.

34
00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.420
Please order the second one.

35
00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:29.460
Listen to me.

36
00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:31.660
The second thing.

37
00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:35.980
I want you to spend all your money.
