00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:09.460
Be careful, boss.

2
00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.780
I can't believe your power is so strong.

3
00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.580
You can pick me up from the front.

4
00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:16.740
But you stop there too.

5
00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:19.060
Let me see what a great mover is.

6
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:24.840
How is that possible?

7
00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.620
You obviously didn't reach the meter size.

8
00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:29.460
Why did the White Dragon guide me?

9
00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.160
No way. How did you do that?

10
00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:34.180
I know.

11
00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.500
The Great House of Soul

12
00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.120
My brother is the commander-in-chief.

13
00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.460
Gather the expectations of thousands of soldiers.

14
00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:41.440
He's not alone in cutting knives.

15
00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:44.660
It's about a million generals working together against the Pantheon.

16
00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:46.120
The General

17
00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.260
Help me defeat the evil Blood Core
