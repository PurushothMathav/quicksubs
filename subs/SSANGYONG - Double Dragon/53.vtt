00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.660
What does that mean?

2
00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:09.580
Dare to ask Your Majesty, behind which family does not have some secrets of its own?

3
00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:11.420
Not the second brother.

4
00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:16.540
You must rely on these to conclude that I am the mastermind behind Northern Xinjiang 2.

5
00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:18.140
I mean...

6
00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:22.540
This is the only way you can work with me.

7
00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.020
What do you mean?

8
00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.920
Let me introduce you to the organization behind me.

9
00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:30.740
Yes, I heard the organization behind you is mysterious.

10
00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:31.980
Great power.

11
00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.060
If we can work together to fight the evil.

12
00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:36.540
Better be big.

13
00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.540
It seems like he just found a mysterious organization behind me.

14
00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.360
The mystery of failure is unknown.

15
00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.580
I can take this opportunity.

16
00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.620
The Magi made him work for the landowner.

17
00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:49.740
But even so

18
00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.540
Why should I help you deal with Big Brother together?

19
00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.120
I've heard recently.

20
00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.500
You don't work well.

21
00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:56.780
Become a stranger

22
00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:00.740
And he's still secretly investigating you, isn't he?

23
00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:02.420
How do you know?

24
00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:03.780
You have to remember.

25
00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.060
This is not the city of Beijing.

26
00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:08.300
I'm in charge.

27
00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.380
And he must also suspect you.

28
00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.900
You don't want to end up like me.

29
00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.100
This issue is very important.

30
00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.220
I need to rethink.

31
00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.100
No hurry, don't reply to me until you think about it.

32
00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:37.120
Sister.

33
00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:38.820
Let's go.
