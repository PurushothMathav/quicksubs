1
00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:02.660
You're here.

2
00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:06.500
Don't get me wrong, I'm here.

3
00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:08.940
Look at your list.

4
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.220
The Beijing Story

5
00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:12.820
If you are innocent

6
00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.060
I'll give you a kiss

7
00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:16.020
But if you're the mastermind...

8
00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:19.020
I will also give an explanation to the unrighteous dead in the northern suburbs.

9
00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:20.740
So until now

10
00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.300
You still think I'm the mastermind.

11
00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:24.700
Right?

12
00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:27.020
Before everything is not clearly checked

13
00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:28.620
Your suspicion is a thief.

14
00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.300
No clear investigation.

15
00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:32.940
Doubt

16
00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:36.860
When you made me get down on my knees

17
00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.380
As long as I spend all my family's money.

18
00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.420
I have no complaints.

19
00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.340
He said I cooperated with the enemy, treason, the political situation was certain.

20
00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:47.460
But when I teach you what's called hard evidence,

21
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.540
After being a guidance physician

22
00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.200
Have you ever had half a penny for your actions?

23
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:57.500
You do not know that I did this because of the so-called honor of the face of your Quang Lang king.

24
00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:58.500
Right?

25
00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:00.340
What about me?

26
00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:03.020
Have you thought about how I feel?

27
00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.380
It's such a dirty cell, why can't you even see it?

28
00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:11.940
Because I think you're too big.

29
00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.820
Is it a victim or a survivor inside and out?

30
00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:17.140
Wait until I check it out.

31
00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:18.300
Infernal Enemy

32
00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.560
Why do you keep playing the maze like this? How long do you want to operate?

33
00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.980
I said Tuyen Vu Uy Vu soon saw thousands of gay Spirit King died.

34
00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.020
This is not a saying you can stay away from.

35
00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.700
You'd better bully. You're not a hero.

36
00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:34.480
If not

37
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.700
I'll never ignore you.
