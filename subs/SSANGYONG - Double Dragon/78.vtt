1
00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.380
Everybody's here.

2
00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:05.360
Surely the spies of your ten nations plugged into my Great Xia?

3
00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:07.600
Of course, after killing you.

4
00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:10.360
We will completely liquidate the Daxia court.

5
00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:15.700
At that time, the entire Great Xia will be completely occupied by our ten countries.

6
00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.100
Then I'm afraid you're too early.

7
00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.660
One Knife Two Knife

8
00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.340
Quang Lang army leader Truong Luong

9
00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:30.800
Obeying the order to invade Thanh Vuong

10
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.900
Commander Zhang, you're just in time.

11
00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:36.860
Bring these psychopathic bandits down to me immediately.

12
00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:38.400
Right.

13
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.160
Truong Liang met Bach Hac Nguyen Quan

14
00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.680
What is Zhang Liang doing?

15
00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:44.000
Can't you hear me?

16
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.800
Of course he heard what you said.

17
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:46.600
But...

18
00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.180
You can't give orders to others.

19
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.240
Didn't Zhang Liang tell you?

20
00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:54.720
Whose orders do you listen to when you enter the temple?

21
00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:55.620
Huyen Vu

22
00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.380
I've never seen him.

23
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:00.580
How is that possible?

24
00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.060
Nothing is impossible.

25
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:03.780
Because Huyen Vu

26
00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:06.020
I've killed you.
