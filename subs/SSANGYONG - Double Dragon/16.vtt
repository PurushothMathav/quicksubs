1
00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.320
The Elder of War God Huyen Diep saw the King of Quang Lang

2
00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:05.440
Wake up, how's everything arranged?

3
00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:06.480
Report to King Quang Lang

4
00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.920
I am waiting for you to arrange everything according to your requirements.

5
00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:10.440
Just waiting for your order.

6
00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.420
Both are polite to cooperate with the outside.

7
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:18.120
How could there be a recording of collusion between the Quang Lang king and the Pantheon?

8
00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:21.160
So who's real is who's fake.

9
00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.060
We're still waiting to see.

10
00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.440
Chu Long's plan was to use the recording of the main part of the plan, how it could be recorded in his hands.

11
00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:30.140
You said the recording was iron evidence.

12
00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:31.900
So King Quang Lang

13
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.340
Let me ask you about the recording in your hand.

14
00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:36.980
Is that iron evidence?

15
00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.820
The person below me has a recording like that.

16
00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.540
But I don't believe

17
00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.620
Such sound synthesis technology is so simple.

18
00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.540
I'm afraid elementary school kids who know a little bit about sound perception can do it.

19
00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:53.700
Why do you believe in such nonsense?

20
00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.540
They say this is hard evidence.

21
00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:57.780
Don't you find it funny

22
00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.660
Does he really swear?

23
00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:02.580
It is not clear that he is not the owner of Yukhe Beijing this time.
