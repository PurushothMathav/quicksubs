00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.760
I'm saying one of you has lawless power.

2
00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:04.040
It's an injustice.

3
00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:06.360
Let two people hate each other, attack each other.

4
00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:09.400
I was finally able to make a profit.

5
00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:11.740
I cut my shirt a long time ago.

6
00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:13.720
He's not my boss anymore.

7
00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:15.580
Honey, what are you doing?

8
00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:16.640
Excuse me.

9
00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.020
Please forgive me, it's him who should apologize.

10
00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:24.000
No, I didn't know this was toxic.

11
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
All I did was to protect myself.

12
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.940
It's a commercial building.

13
00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.060
Stood at the top of the building.

14
00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:37.040
Even if the host meets me, he must respect me three parts.

15
00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:38.900
Why do I need someone to protect me?

16
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.660
You can make me spend all my fortune on my knees.

17
00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.420
But in exchange for more crime.

18
00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.740
That's how you protect me.

19
00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.460
Do you really care about our brotherhood?

20
00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:54.180
Do you care about me?

21
00:00:54.320 --> 00:01:00.280
So I soon decided that my destiny was in my hands.

22
00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:01.500
I want to reorder.

23
00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.260
Take back my way
