1
00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.600
He said yes.

2
00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:05.060
So if he points at anyone at the scene...

3
00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:06.380
Do you believe it?

4
00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:12.700
This is what we found in other people.

5
00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:17.420
What's inside is that you colluded with the Pantheon accident organization.

6
00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.740
Joint assassination Quang Linh Nhat

7
00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:22.200
We went to Bikini to find out.

8
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:23.380
It's written on here.

9
00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.500
It's your own.

10
00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.140
Here's the proof.

11
00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:31.380
What army of white deer colluded with the Pantheon?

12
00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:32.920
How is that possible?

13
00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.600
The truth is right in front of you.

14
00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.800
I always thought there was a misunderstanding.

15
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.920
Now the gods are like mountains.

16
00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.000
This White Hac Yuan Army is really the power to want to focus.

17
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.520
Will do such a thing.

18
00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.340
This is my general's disgrace.

19
00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:48.240
Master.

20
00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:49.980
Master is not good.

21
00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.380
I don't believe Yuan Joon would do this.

22
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.780
Leaving non-strict iron proof does not erase

23
00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:56.540
Not guilty yet.

24
00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.300
You also believe it's mine.

25
00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:05.140
I'm asking you, and the answer is that I didn't collude with the Pantheon.

26
00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:08.340
This letter was not written by me.

27
00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:10.900
It's fake.

28
00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.940
It's no shame that the border guards are white herons.

29
00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.840
The evidence is in front of you.

30
00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.100
You can still be so calm.

31
00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.620
But if I'm not quite sure

32
00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.020
Dare to honor you in vain to the king of sinners?

33
00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.380
Do you want to hear what's inside?

34
00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:31.900
If you're so confident.

35
00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:33.600
So I'm curious.

36
00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.460
What the hell's in there?
