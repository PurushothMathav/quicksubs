00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.100
Waiting for responsibility.

2
00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:03.260
Dare to be good at Quang Lang kingdom

3
00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:04.480
Want to rebel?

4
00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:06.000
I'm Minister of Criminal Affairs Liu Van.

5
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.220
Someone reported today.

6
00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.420
King of Quang Lang colluded with the Pantheon

7
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:11.980
The intention to overthrow me Ly Linh Vuong elephant

8
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:12.920
Unify him for me.

9
00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:16.020
The absurd king, the first blood of some kind of elephant.

10
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:17.120
Brilliant feat

11
00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:18.000
Loyal.

12
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.800
How could you collude with the Pantheon?

13
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.060
Overturn the elephant

14
00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:24.060
"Do you dare to sin against the king of Quang Lang?"

15
00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:26.080
That's very brave.

16
00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:27.140
Real or fake.

17
00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.780
Qin Quang Lang King sent me to Thien Long Son to clarify the waterway.

18
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.980
Take me, I'll see who you dare.

19
00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:34.620
Save Van

20
00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:37.740
Who gave you the liver?

21
00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:41.180
Dare to stop my hand.

22
00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:47.080
The Holy Spirit is truly a great power.

23
00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:50.180
You said I colluded with the Pantheon.

24
00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.840
Then I'll ask you where the evidence is.

25
00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:53.660
Evidence

26
00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.160
Over here.

27
00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.600
What did I tell you?

28
00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.540
That day you were like my people, making me kneel down.

29
00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:03.420
Now all of this.

30
00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.100
I'll give it all away.
