00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.620
It's okay, I agree.

2
00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:05.340
I thank your ancestors for eighteen generations.

3
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.540
Quickly flee with your Dragon King of Karma.

4
00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:12.340
Smiling to death, his harem needs you, what are you saying?

5
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:13.560
I said that.

6
00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:14.920
Isn't that annulment?

7
00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.500
Come on, I can hear what someone just said.

8
00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:20.220
A harem or something.

9
00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:22.300
The voice is identical to the jade road.

10
00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:23.980
Did I hear the voice?

11
00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.320
Okay, I promise.

12
00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:28.800
Uncle Don is talking about getting engaged to my father.

13
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.100
We'll be right over.

14
00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:33.060
Perfect.

15
00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.060
Ha ha ha

16
00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:42.740
Don't go.

17
00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:46.360
Facing this kind of stupid woman, you have to make a decision right away.

18
00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:47.600
Cut off the relationship immediately.

19
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.180
I see how the devil steals money.

20
00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:55.420
Master, I want to be the last enemy of Tang Tang

21
00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:58.460
I'm sorry, Su Ha.

22
00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:00.740
The First Beauty of Suzhou City

23
00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.240
Become a harem

24
00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:06.700
But Ye Chen has destroyed people's homes.

25
00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.960
Sugar Tank

26
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.700
Ah, Tang Tang Tang Yu.

27
00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:18.540
What's wrong?

28
00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.340
You're welcome, I'm just a rainbow.

29
00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.520
Yeah, it's just me and him.

30
00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.300
Maybe he could just talk.

31
00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.300
That's ridiculous.

32
00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.780
Can I hear him?

33
00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.280
Well, don't worry about it.

34
00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.540
Isn't that the word "kiss"?

35
00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.420
Don't worry.

36
00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.300
Sir.

37
00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.080
Hi, Sue, little fish.

38
00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:52.360
You're back in time.

39
00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:57.000
Your father and I are studying your marriage to the Guangdong people.

40
00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.140
Which day do you think is better?

41
00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.860
Uh, Sue, the elders.

42
00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:03.100
That's right.

43
00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.260
I think so.

44
00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.340
Strongly twisted melon cannot be sweet.

45
00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:11.240
I've been thinking about it lately, thinking about myself a little bit.

46
00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:14.860
I think my personality and Mo Yue s really don t match up very well.

47
00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.000
This marriage.

48
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.780
Haha, forget it.

49
00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:20.600
What small fish?

50
00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.980
Is that what you mean by laminated fish?

51
00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.500
No, there's no woodfish, what's going on?

52
00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.240
Sorry about the house.

53
00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:33.860
The Road To became the first beautiful woman to be a harem because Ye Thuan family destroyed people.

54
00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.540
Dad, let me talk.

55
00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.860
Actually, what I'm trying to say is

56
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.080
If you want to marry me, look at me.

57
00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:43.400
Just saying it's inappropriate?

58
00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.500
What do you say is inappropriate?

59
00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.500
You said you wanted to marry me.
