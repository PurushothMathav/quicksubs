1
00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.980
The Surabaya mansion forbids fighting.

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.140
Personal grievances come outside the settlement page.

3
00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.200
If you don't have 50 billion cash

4
00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.560
The lion is here as a photo.

5
00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:16.460
And you have to pay a 30% breach of contract penalty.

6
00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.920
50 billion is nothing to me.

7
00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:20.780
It's exactly this hatred.

8
00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:22.240
I can't make 50 billion.

9
00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.220
But you're going to slander me like this.

10
00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:27.980
Then I can also report you.

11
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.200
It is clear that the government has locked down your company.

12
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:32.780
What does that have to do with me?

13
00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.980
If not the house you own.

14
00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.960
They'll never shut down my company.

15
00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.280
Mr. Ip is afraid of being a little obsessed.

16
00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.840
The trade war is you hole me, I hole you.

17
00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:43.920
What's to blame?

18
00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.780
Do you think the trade war is real?

19
00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.260
It's using boiling water to bring down the fortune tree.

20
00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.040
Stole the rich cat at the door?

21
00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:55.680
Oh, Mr. Ben, I feel like my first priority is not to leave this lion in the picture.

22
00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:56.540
Go ahead.

23
00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:58.740
I paid 50 billion.

24
00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:00.840
Aren't you done selling it to me?

25
00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.420
Mr. Tang is ready to take over.

26
00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:04.680
Nothing is impossible.

27
00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.140
Wait, even though I can't get 50 billion dollars in cash.

28
00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.260
But I can use my real estate as collateral.

29
00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:14.020
The Dragon King couldn't be in such a hurry.

30
00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.300
Can't you stop getting the lion's jewel today?

31
00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.300
Long Than Group Head Office

32
00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.180
Nam Thanh Hi-Tech Park worth at least 60 billion VND

33
00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:25.180
I pressed it all in.

34
00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.900
You can clean up now.

35
00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.380
Mr. Ip.

36
00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:33.560
Mr. Tong also prioritizes each other according to regulations.

37
00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:34.600
Please forgive me.

38
00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.800
It's okay, I bought it.

39
00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:37.980
It's just fun.

40
00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.140
Not like some Ye.

41
00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.500
It's bankruptcy.

42
00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:46.860
I admire your suicidal spirit.

43
00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:50.500
It'll make you laugh later.
