00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:04.300
Boss, are there any tools here to remove souls?

2
00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:07.540
What is it, of course?

3
00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.920
Maybe your mind will tell you how this small place can eliminate the gas of objects.

4
00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:16.280
You still use this amulet I'm giving you.

5
00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:17.760
Don't underestimate this.

6
00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.760
I learned this from a master.

7
00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:21.740
It took me three months to learn it.

8
00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.220
You, bringing him with you every night will definitely protect you from getting deadly gas into your body.

9
00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.440
Thank you.

10
00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:30.060
I'll always carry him.

11
00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.420
It's all what friends say, thank you.

12
00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.460
Things that are not trendy also deserve this ax.

13
00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.920
Say what?

14
00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.120
This amulet does not use Zhu Sa talisman paper.

15
00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:41.860
It's just yellow paper.

16
00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:43.860
Two more ghost drawings

17
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.360
Hmm, and the first bag here must be a human figure.

18
00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:51.240
Write or not write.

19
00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:52.460
Don't pretend to understand.

20
00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:57.920
Haha ha, this amulet uses the method of blood trauma.

21
00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.540
It is possible to ensure that the wearer is not attacked by lethal gas.

22
00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:06.820
But if you use it, it is not the evil of a noble Dharma person.

23
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.180
That's the evil of the devil's creator.

24
00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.100
You're talking nonsense.

25
00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.100
I warn you not to talk nonsense.

26
00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:15.700
Let's go if you don't believe me.

27
00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:17.180
Too bad stuff.

28
00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.740
Minh Chau allies

29
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.740
Who knows Phoenix?

30
00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.500
It's a pity.
