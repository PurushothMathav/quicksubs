00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.940
It's gotten to this point, you still have a hard mouth.

2
00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:03.500
I don't really see the coffin crying.

3
00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:05.740
It is not wrong to seek death.

4
00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:08.040
Wang Julong, this is the medicine god you came to.

5
00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.340
Bravery isn't just babbling here.

6
00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:12.320
It's stupid not knowing good or bad.

7
00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:13.120
Ladies and gentlemen.

8
00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:14.340
This brother didn't mean that.

9
00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:15.620
Dear, are you the Queen?

10
00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:17.160
Otherwise, I can't protect you.

11
00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.580
Two and a half minutes to hit.

12
00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.440
Call me a bunch of decision-making jobs.

13
00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:24.460
Stop, this Ye is not an alarm.

14
00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:26.740
Jiang's treatment has a plug.

15
00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:36.960
Isn't the plot right?

16
00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.020
There's vertigo in this acupressure.

17
00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.120
But this is the king of medicine.

18
00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.000
Why is this big-breasted girl so fat?

19
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.740
Is there a disease?

20
00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:46.520
Miss Wang

21
00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:49.740
You're really gifted with business intentions.

22
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.280
But this is as far apart as mountains.

23
00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:53.240
Old man, I said 50 years of practice.

24
00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:57.480
How could there be a flaw that you can see that I'm ignoring?

25
00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:58.480
Yeah, girl.

26
00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:00.520
Let the professional do it.

27
00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:01.640
Isn't that what you always say?

28
00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.180
Don't let the zombies hear Dr. Zhang.

29
00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.700
My grandfather's been sick for over three months.

30
00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:05.840
During the time the bed does not move

31
00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:07.120
Upstream air in the upper limb.

32
00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:09.200
What is the rate of congestion during this time?

33
00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.560
You said it's done.

34
00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:11.920
Don't just wake him up.

35
00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:13.740
After that, he's still gone.

36
00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.260
Thanks to Lady Wang reminding him that he had missed a big deal.

37
00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:32.500
Miss Wang is a genius.

38
00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.240
Not just in business.

39
00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.400
Unexpected for medicine is also so proficient in divine medicine

40
00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.940
That's a compliment, if it wasn't for the minister.

41
00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.560
How do I know my grandfather's problems are in my hands?

42
00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.060
I don't know where that minister is now.

43
00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:47.600
Didn't everyone see it?

44
00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.120
Did the lady say it was domestic?

45
00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:50.920
Impossible, insulting a real person.

46
00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.680
I can't believe he actually has a little bit of talent.

47
00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:54.740
Ms. Wang was so complimentary.

48
00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.260
I'm just Tang Shao Yin with me.
