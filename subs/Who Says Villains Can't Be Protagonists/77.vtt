00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:11.240
Old man, you've been making antiques for 50 years.

2
00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:13.380
I went to the eye twice today.

3
00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.220
This jewel lion has another cave.

4
00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.020
Master Ip, what is this medicine?

5
00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:20.800
This is a lot of gold to find.

6
00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.260
There will be no second person in this world.

7
00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:25.000
You know what this is?

8
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Hey, you told me you were a hundred years ago.

9
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.580
There's a master alchemist.

10
00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.000
Train the three same heavens and the earth to create this kind of incompetent celestial object

11
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.540
The winner of the first two

12
00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.260
Correspondingly in the hands of world-famous thieves.

13
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:40.900
Can leave children's fingers

14
00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.500
King of Assassins

15
00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:44.300
And this one...

16
00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:47.260
It's the last of these three.

17
00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.860
I immediately had an armor.

18
00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.180
The whole world is not my enemy.

19
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:05.420
And you'll be a gift on my land

20
00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:07.200
What are you dreaming about?

21
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.540
Only you this chrysanthemum covered in trash on what do we break our heads with?

22
00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:11.860
What do you rely on?

23
00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.260
Wow.

24
00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.260
It's actually lymph like that.

25
00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:21.660
What do you mean?

26
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:22.800
Come here.

27
00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:24.160
Come here.

28
00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.340
We can run.
