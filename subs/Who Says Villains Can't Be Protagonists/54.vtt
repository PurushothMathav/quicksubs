00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:02.660
Hey, hey.

2
00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:07.900
I'm afraid when I scan the grave, I'll stab the girls.

3
00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:09.240
I won.

4
00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.180
It's beautiful. I'm gone.

5
00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:12.700
This is an article.

6
00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.880
Isn't that right? There's 120,000 of them.

7
00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.060
The plot is obviously that the train makes predictions.

8
00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:21.820
It's done for the first time.

9
00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.540
How could he have a problem?

10
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.580
Make yourself explode again.

11
00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.140
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

12
00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:31.580
I thought you were capable of something.

13
00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.100
Half a day doesn't solve the problem.

14
00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.200
It makes the problem more serious.

15
00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.660
That's rubbish.

16
00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.100
The real source of the gas is in the home.

17
00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:44.740
Take a look.

18
00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:47.620
What is this?

19
00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:52.820
My team-building boss, the old dog dared to calculate me.

20
00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.060
Trading attention a fair trade

21
00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:59.140
My stuff's in the counter.

22
00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.740
It is you who learn the art of the stars that can bury your head in this admiring antique.

23
00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:09.300
Of course, they might want to hurt the family.

24
00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.900
That's why you live so promising.

25
00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:13.820
That's bullshit.

26
00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.520
Here's your whole story. I think this guy has something.

27
00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:22.180
Unbelievably, it was also a scrap, and Master Chen was helpless.

28
00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:23.720
A child is scared.

29
00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:24.680
How many possibilities do you have?

30
00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:25.800
We're in trouble.

31
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:26.800
The owner is in a coma.

32
00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.680
In this battle, no one can destroy the weapon.

33
00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.140
How is that good?

34
00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.260
You take risks.

35
00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.380
This person is a wreck.

36
00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:40.200
But we Tang Thieu determined thousands of people bravely know how to kill gas

37
00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.000
Him.

38
00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:43.900
That's a finger that can actually be broken.

39
00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:46.280
How do I know?

40
00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.880
Learn the true colors of autumn people, Sunday and then talk about this.

41
00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:50.600
Shit can't be blamed on him.

42
00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:51.940
Just went to King 8.

43
00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.860
Why the reporter?

44
00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.860
Looks like you guys are dead in the hole.
