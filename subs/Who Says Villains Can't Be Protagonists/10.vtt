00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:01.620
What's this gentleman called?

2
00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:03.980
I'm in charge here, Wang Dufa.

3
00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:07.580
My name is Dragon Tooth.

4
00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:08.880
Where's our boss?

5
00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.000
Wanted to organize a birthday party for his woman, Ms. To Moc Nguyet To.

6
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.800
How much is your top package?

7
00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:15.680
Set the price.

8
00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:18.060
The moon is right.

9
00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:20.660
It's the great lady of the To family, To Moc Nguyet.

10
00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:21.820
What situation?

11
00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.660
This is the same guy who robbed me last year.

12
00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.340
What did the boss say?

13
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:28.080
The king is like that.

14
00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.960
Go to this investor first.

15
00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.240
No matter what conditions he offered, he refused.

16
00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:33.040
No.

17
00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:36.780
All agree it's not him. Come on, let's go.

18
00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.520
Do better.

19
00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:39.680
I get it.

20
00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.500
The young master's intention was to agree to this first.

21
00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.220
Then they ruined their calculations.

22
00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:46.540
It's a small thing.

23
00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:47.840
Then I have to catch him.

24
00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.200
Come on, I've got work to do.

25
00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:51.200
How much money can not be said

26
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.220
Oh, dragons, right?

27
00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.960
Your company is a famous rising star in our city.

28
00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:58.580
So I'm in charge.

29
00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.500
The top floor of the hotel is open for one day use.

30
00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:05.500
And there's no charge.

31
00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:09.340
I've just heard that your top floor is never rented.

32
00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.160
I thought I'd have to talk.

33
00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:12.720
I can't believe General Manager Wang, right?

34
00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.580
Haha, is it really timely?

35
00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.720
We want to be married to your company.

36
00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.340
These two are nice.

37
00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.940
Long Thanh Group we accept your friendship.

38
00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:30.600
I'll send you the birthday party plan later. Be sure to arrange it for me on site.

39
00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.980
Ha ha ha

40
00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.200
Hey, what did I tell you to do?

41
00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.320
Don't worry, young man.

42
00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:39.820
Everything is under control.

43
00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:43.480
Yes, if you can do it for me.

44
00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:45.180
I'll give you a promotion and a raise in a while.

45
00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:46.580
How much?

46
00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:48.180
Haha.

47
00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:52.900
Sun Wukuyet this time I see you with your mouth curled Dragon King

48
00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:57.340
Want to die?
