00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:02.760
And the program

2
00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:04.520
Oh, where's all this flower?

3
00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:06.820
And in letters, what does this say?

4
00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:11.500
Love you baby

5
00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:14.460
These are all the fish I prepared for you.

6
00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:19.320
It's not my brother hiding the fish.

7
00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.880
This is Master Tang, right?

8
00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:24.540
God, Don's so romantic.

9
00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:30.660
Hey, Surprise.

10
00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:32.380
The young man was not surprised.

11
00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.000
No surprise.

12
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.500
How's my drone and fireworks?

13
00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.980
I can't stand your grandmother's leg.

14
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:40.660
Ah.

15
00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:44.560
Van Street

16
00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:46.680
Thank you.

17
00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.880
I love the surprise you have prepared for me.

18
00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:51.900
Uh, you can if you like.

19
00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:53.060
Where's my beard?

20
00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.160
The original Tang Yu you still did not appear

21
00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:58.940
Just to prepare this gift for me.

22
00:00:58.960 --> 00:00:59.920
Thank you very much.

23
00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:01.040
I'm very happy today.

24
00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:02.200
What to do?

25
00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.940
Master, I'm afraid I'm going to die.

26
00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.780
They're sugar.

27
00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:09.340
Did you do this?

28
00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.260
Dust, you let go that's right.

29
00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:16.540
All these things are the young master we prepared for Miss Su.
