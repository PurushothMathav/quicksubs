00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:01.740
10 million

2
00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:04.700
That's right.

3
00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:06.120
This lion.

4
00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:07.680
It's nothing strange.

5
00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.500
It's just that the nine-bow lock is worth holding.

6
00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:13.620
I bought it for my nephew as a birthday present.

7
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.360
It's nothing strange.

8
00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.460
If you don't believe me, you can see for yourself.

9
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:29.980
The bird is as the Master said.

10
00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:32.860
This jewel lion, but there's a nine-bow lock underneath.

11
00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.100
The lion is too small.

12
00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:36.920
There's nothing hidden inside.

13
00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:38.820
There is no missing this pair.

14
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.660
Let's continue the auction.

15
00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.040
The current price is 10 million.

16
00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:49.320
Are there any more price increases?

17
00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.220
10 million watching you make money like this

18
00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.040
All tens of millions plus 10 million and 10 million.

19
00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:57.080
You are poor and in debt.

20
00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:59.020
Two or three rows apart, I smell it all.

21
00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.540
If I hadn't been Commander-in-Chief, I would have been here.

22
00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.100
A one wow.

23
00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.580
That's a hundred million.

24
00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:17.160
What's this not about?

25
00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.160
Nothing strange this time.

26
00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.420
Why is even sugar missing?

27
00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.620
Cousin This Way

28
00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.100
Could it be against me?

29
00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:27.960
Mr. Ip, what do you mean?

30
00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.640
I was buying stuff.

31
00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.420
Maybe this clap will be opened by your Dragon God Corporation.

32
00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.160
You're like two lion dog shit. What do you want the jewel lion to do?

33
00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:39.280
You know the jewel?

34
00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.160
I also have a nephew.

35
00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.660
My nephew also needs to buy some gifts.
