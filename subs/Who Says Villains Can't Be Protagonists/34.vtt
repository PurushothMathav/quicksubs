00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:05.340
It's finally okay, you drink it.

2
00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:07.680
Hey.

3
00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:09.540
Boss.

4
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.580
Hey, come here, come here, how's it going?

5
00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:15.820
Look.

6
00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.360
Dear sister, let me introduce you.

7
00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:23.420
This man is the First Grand Duke of Tang

8
00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:29.480
Haha, okay, also my eternal big brother, today is my first time coming.

9
00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:31.180
You must come with me.

10
00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:32.900
Okay.

11
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.320
Young Master Tang

12
00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:36.540
Have some wine.

13
00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.300
Master Tang, what kind of girl do you like?

14
00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:40.660
Male teenager

15
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:42.740
Wait a minute.

16
00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:44.700
What's going on, boss?

17
00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:47.740
I'm leaving.

18
00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:49.020
It's too noisy, isn't it?

19
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:50.700
Let them go out to eat.

20
00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.160
No.

21
00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:54.260
The louder the better.

22
00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:58.800
Hey, where are you?

23
00:00:58.800 --> 00:00:59.980
You care about me.

24
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.440
What do you mean?

25
00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.820
Didn't that happen to you that day?

26
00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:05.100
Ah.

27
00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:06.820
I made a wish.

28
00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:08.500
After we get married.

29
00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.300
We're going to have a son and a daughter.

30
00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.200
You haven't contacted me since your birthday.

31
00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:18.640
Who do you think I am?

32
00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.440
Did you say you didn't return the goods yourself?

33
00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:25.440
Right? I do what you want, you won't forgive me?

34
00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:28.640
Two and a half years playing with your feelings, you're still right, aren't you?

35
00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.680
I told you I'm at the Star River Club.

36
00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:31.720
Drinking with the girls.

37
00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:32.820
There's no time to talk to you

38
00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:35.980
It's okay, contact the drift bottle.

39
00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.780
Come here.

40
00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.420
Who is this girl?

41
00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.380
Come and play with us.

42
00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.420
You hear that?

43
00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.660
Haha, Tang Yu, you bastard.

44
00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:49.040
I must marry you to your house.

45
00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:50.240
Are you in Tien Ha?

46
00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:51.260
You're waiting for me.
