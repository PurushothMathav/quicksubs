00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:03.420
The devil even dared to fight me.

2
00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:06.160
If the poor can solve this little murder today,

3
00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:08.800
You have to pay for your own hands, dare you?

4
00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.500
If you can't solve

5
00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:13.000
This angel's sword is yours.

6
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.840
All right.

7
00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:16.780
Take it up.

8
00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:37.320
Mr. Qin, this is the murder weapon of your Qin script.

9
00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.080
The leader just needs to destroy him.

10
00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:41.220
The Qin can be safe without worry.

11
00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.260
Killing chickens is so good.

12
00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:47.760
Playing is definitely brothers.

13
00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.580
Chen Thien is indeed a non-fiction name.

14
00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:51.800
As soon as he did, he caught the gas.

15
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.120
No tiger was the first in the class.

16
00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:54.560
My mother.

17
00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:56.120
Is this thing so evil?

18
00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.260
Everything please.

19
00:00:58.960 --> 00:00:59.940
Like water one.

20
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.160
I'm going, boss.

21
00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:27.500
It's working.

22
00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:31.260
The angel is not nameless.

23
00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:32.420
It's okay.

24
00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.300
Idiot, you think such a simple difference, don't even beg.

25
00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.160
You wear this too.

26
00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:38.000
There's nothing else.

27
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.880
Digging holes for your families is still good.

28
00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.220
Wait, wait a minute, it's also required to jump in the second row.

29
00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:47.280
So far.

30
00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.880
What else can you say?

31
00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:50.420
Get on your knees.

32
00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:51.980
Sorry for the gift.

33
00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.240
Break your arm.

34
00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.620
Don't be happy too early.

35
00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.620
You can also turn around and see if the other gas has finally dissipated.
