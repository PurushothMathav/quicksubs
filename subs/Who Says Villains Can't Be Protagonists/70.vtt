00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.840
This is the bamboo map of Xiao Xiang by To Thi, the great writer of Song Dynasty.

2
00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:09.320
The picture is clear

3
00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:10.280
The level of abundance

4
00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:11.260
Strict structure

5
00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.680
This is a rare treasure in Chinese painting circles.

6
00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.360
Starting price 50 million

7
00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.200
Drawing well.

8
00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:18.100
This color.

9
00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.140
This product looks like a lonely product.

10
00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:22.540
I paid 50 million.

11
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.400
It's so lonely I can't miss it.

12
00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.660
I paid 55 million 60 million.

13
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.620
How do you see that it is counterfeit?

14
00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.600
Mr. Dongpo loves Lord Tengyun very much.

15
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.180
I'd rather have no meat.

16
00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:41.660
You can't live without an owner.

17
00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:43.740
He painted bamboo like a sword.

18
00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.080
Inherited his cousin Van To

19
00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:47.700
His owner's hands and feet are out.

20
00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.140
Has an extremely gas hero posture

21
00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.860
But the owner of this word only sees danger.

22
00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:54.620
You can't.

23
00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:56.600
It's obviously a lie from posterity.

24
00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.240
You stop talking shit.

25
00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:59.240
What can only ride?

26
00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:00.880
This owner is obviously Mr. Dongpo.

27
00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:05.260
The writing style of a door and the inscription are considered new and old at the end of the photo roll.

28
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.500
These are all real works by Mr. Dongpo.

29
00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:08.780
How can there be counterfeiting?

30
00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.680
Master Ho is vice president of the Meteor Association.

31
00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:12.680
The antiques he looked at.

32
00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:13.960
It's never wrong.

33
00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.700
Where did you see Master Ho s eyes?

34
00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.380
The Master cannot hold you now.

35
00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.960
Mr. Ye, this product has been strictly inspected by us.

36
00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:24.640
If you feel really sure.

37
00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.460
You can go up here and check which network plan you're using.

38
00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.680
But then again

39
00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:30.860
His trick.

40
00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.340
It seems really possible.

41
00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.060
What? Look.

42
00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:38.500
The best TV series is

43
00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.140
Mr. Ip, what are you doing?
