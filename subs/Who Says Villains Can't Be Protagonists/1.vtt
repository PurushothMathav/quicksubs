00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:01.520
Hey.

2
00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.540
I declare that the two Heavenly Ladies are officially married.

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.140
I disagree.

4
00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:13.340
This marriage.

5
00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:15.820
I disagree with the Dragon King.

6
00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.060
Not good, the mouth of the Dragon King is tilted outside, so you wipe his mouth.

7
00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:22.780
Wet.

8
00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:27.360
Ah.

9
00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.360
Well, now these rewards are there.

10
00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.560
There are some idiots missing this.

11
00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:44.780
Even dogs are dumber than this.

12
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.060
Open Mission

13
00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.380
In novels that dogs can write.

14
00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.000
Live to the end

15
00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.140
Good luck.

16
00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.140
What the hell?

17
00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:04.820
It's my phone.

18
00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:12.800
Where's my helmet?

19
00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.440
Master Tang, the wine you brought

20
00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:15.700
Congratulations on your engagement.

21
00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:20.180
Thieu Road Du

22
00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.020
I was in the book.

23
00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.140
No, why am I a villain?

24
00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:28.320
Attention, please.

25
00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.080
The current Dragon King War God Drama Flower Capital Chapter 32

26
00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.320
Your mission has lived through this chapter.

27
00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.160
If successful, you will receive the mysterious reward of the system.

28
00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.620
If it fails, it will be permanently deleted.

29
00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.940
Kill what?

30
00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:46.180
The Dragon King God of War could not speak.

31
00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:51.980
People who have seen life.

32
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.100
The main character in the legend of the Dragon King

33
00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.120
If according to the original script

34
00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:59.080
He's going to kill me.

35
00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:00.500
Up to the top of life

36
00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:01.700
No, no, no.

37
00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:03.680
I have to live.

38
00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:04.660
I have to give up kissing.

39
00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.980
Where's the lady?

40
00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.460
You're here too. Married.

41
00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:15.540
Hi.

42
00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.900
Street Dance

43
00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.140
Hi, Sue.

44
00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.000
Passion is the devil.

45
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.160
Put the knife down.

46
00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:31.440
We have something to talk about.

47
00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.340
Three Years of Dance

48
00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.860
I've made it clear to you.

49
00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:37.940
I can't marry someone like you.

50
00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.340
If you still want to marry me today

51
00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.520
What you get is a cold corpse.

52
00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:45.620
Hey, it scares me.

53
00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.340
Do you want to kiss?

54
00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:50.900
Want from the kiss, you say.

55
00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.480
Isn't that annulment?

56
00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:53.820
It's okay, I agree.
