1
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.140
Right.

2
00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:21.060
Ah.

3
00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:24.120
Kill it.

4
00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:26.840
If you do not quickly force people into the enlightened body out three tablets.

5
00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:28.220
Will die.

6
00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.100
Mr. Ip was insulted by my disciple just now.

7
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.300
Only the girl wearing your amulet is safe today.

8
00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:36.540
You will surely kill it.

9
00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:37.480
But please save me.

10
00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:38.480
Vacation Explained

11
00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:39.200
I have to take a leave of absence.

12
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:40.140
Ugly thank you.

13
00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.260
The time for the Dragon King's equipment has come.

14
00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.300
Later he should take out the Slaughterhouse.

15
00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:46.780
Then find another excuse.

16
00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.300
The jade statue of Buddha was deliberately sold to the Qin Dynasty.

17
00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.280
It is also the grace that is taken away.

18
00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:52.300
Kill him!

19
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.320
Under the Gratitude of the Family

20
00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.420
It is a pity that they are obedient to the queen.

21
00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.700
Could I ask you to buy it outside three days ago?

22
00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:05.820
Speaking of family, you started three days ago.

23
00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:12.320
Mr. Ip is bothering you.

24
00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:13.760
It's a pity, don't worry.

25
00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:15.440
You and I are both good money.

26
00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.420
Home is my business.

27
00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.120
Yes.

28
00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.500
I can't believe this guy actually has two brushes.

29
00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.480
Chen Tiansheng could do nothing.

30
00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:45.300
He managed to solve it in a few seconds, and this was the real genius.

31
00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.940
It's much stronger than that Chen Thien.

32
00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:50.020
You really can't compare.

33
00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:52.520
Mr. Ye, thank you very much.

34
00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:53.420
No need for guests.

35
00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:55.480
You and I are good friends.

36
00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:57.180
Help me get a leave of absence.
