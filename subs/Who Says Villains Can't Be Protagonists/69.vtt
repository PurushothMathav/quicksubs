00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:04.840
Young master.

2
00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:09.060
This water-like mansion is the largest underground auction house in our South City.

3
00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:10.860
When will you auction your

4
00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.220
Young master naturally has the morality of young master.

5
00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:19.740
Song Chi Minh starts an important hidden mission

6
00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:21.020
Long Vuong Lang Wear

7
00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:23.500
Please come to the four country villa to play the original city

8
00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.080
Why not like Giang Son?

9
00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:35.180
If you don't mind

10
00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.060
Today it's Ben turning the bow into a bow.

11
00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.900
The day against killing you.

12
00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:45.680
Stop.

13
00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:47.100
How dare you.

14
00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.020
Dare to appear in front of me.

15
00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:51.920
This is huge recruiting.

16
00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:52.820
This is me.

17
00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:07.080
Everybody's seen it.

18
00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.440
That's not me. I call it smart defense.

19
00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:10.160
Master.

20
00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:11.220
Haha.

21
00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:15.980
Your words have died, you can't stop, you want to die again.

22
00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:18.000
What are you doing?

23
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.180
Can't go up?

24
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.160
Master Tang.

25
00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:23.520
This is a villa like water.

26
00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.780
There is no day in the cave here. Do you hate long life? Do you think I look like a person who will cause trouble?

27
00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:29.020
Right, Van?

28
00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.820
Mr. Tang Shaoying

29
00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.340
You're both my guests.

30
00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.940
I don't want my guest of honor to have an accident in my mansion.

31
00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:45.620
If you still want to do

32
00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.380
Then bear the consequences yourself.

33
00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:49.180
Because of the two of you.

34
00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:50.860
Except for my house.

35
00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:52.400
The old man had no seat.

36
00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:53.200
No, no, no.

37
00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.180
Honey, don't be impulsive.

38
00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.360
As long as we get the innate infinity singularity

39
00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.260
Aren't these Tang people a mission to take away?

40
00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.820
I don't know what to buy.

41
00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:05.500
Even if they are

42
00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.100
It's all part of our plan.

43
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.620
Employees understand that they will start immediately.

44
00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.340
You took it.

45
00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:30.520
What are you standing there for?

46
00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:31.820
Kill them.

47
00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:35.440
Ah, Master, this is the Surabaya mansion.

48
00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:36.640
Look at the unmarked hole here.

49
00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:37.920
Are you a human being?

50
00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.240
Do I look like a mess?

51
00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:41.460
Right, Van Lang?
