00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.700
Dragon's Tooth.

2
00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:08.240
My lord, I advise you to have a better life.

3
00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:10.480
Governor Long, what's going on?

4
00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:11.880
And this Ye?

5
00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.740
He's a shareholder of our Dragon God Corporation.

6
00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:18.740
Today's party is also that he will ask me to rent this purple cloud booth to organize.

7
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.580
Hum is deaf.

8
00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:22.260
Don't you eat lunch in the afternoon?

9
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.660
I have been kind enough to help you cushion the yard. Why are you still like a chicken breast?

10
00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:26.640
Since then.

11
00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.020
Why am I waiting for my dog?

12
00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:29.300
Not sincere.

13
00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:30.760
Dragons, right?

14
00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:32.400
You're just in time.

15
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.820
Are you just waiting for us to attack Mr. Ip?

16
00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.320
Then you can be just good enough to intimidate us who don't have eyes.

17
00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.820
My son really sings a good song, my friend.

18
00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:43.400
Ngo Viet, you've got the wrong idea.

19
00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:44.960
Dragons always have the key.

20
00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.700
Not having time to talk to me about this is just a coincidence.

21
00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.040
I know you like dessert.

22
00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:03.380
I've invited the world's first dessert master to make a special cake for you, do you like it?

23
00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.640
Although I don't know exactly what you are.

24
00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.060
But I think there are some things that should be made clear to you.

25
00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:14.060
Wow.

26
00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:16.960
This fireworks is beautiful.

27
00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.160
Let's take us out.

28
00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.940
Come, let's go out and have a look.

29
00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:23.940
Wow.

30
00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.040
It's too big.

31
00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:28.280
What a great pen.

32
00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.480
This fireworks show every business can't get, of course, small romance costs a lot of money.

33
00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:35.960
Wow, I don't know which young master is willing to do that, so why ask?

34
00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:37.980
It must be the Holy Spirit.

35
00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.380
If it wasn't for him, I'd eat this table.
