00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:03.540
Hey, are you sick?

2
00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:05.040
What do you care what he does with so much alcohol?

3
00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.880
Do you know this woman who exercises every day, exercises every day, her whole body dies.

4
00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.060
I'm drunk and I have to carry it.

5
00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.780
Brother, you've done the wrong thing.

6
00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.040
Self-Falling Clouds

7
00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.260
When he and Liu Hai left, he poured half a bottle of SO.

8
00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.940
I think 80% means something to you.

9
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.240
What are you thinking?

10
00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:22.760
Did you know he's been playing me like a licking dog for two and a half years?

11
00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:24.140
I'm like a dog licking intern.

12
00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.260
I was used as a shield at the birthday party.

13
00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.420
Take him home.

14
00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:31.920
Pack it on me.

15
00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:38.720
Young master, when you get home, I can have another small party, two and a half, and you haven't moved your hand yet.

16
00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:40.220
Call me back and we'll compensate.

17
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.220
There's another one, Miss Lin, remember me.

18
00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.420
Maybe it's as far away as he is.

19
00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:52.940
This woman in your hands is more than your son ever touched, remember?

20
00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:03.140
Road to my office.

21
00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:04.580
I have a big project.

22
00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:06.100
I want to talk to you.

23
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.060
Haha, you don't have time, do you?

24
00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:13.740
I was sorting my cell phone just now, but I found some undeleted photos.

25
00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.700
You said if I send a circle of friends

26
00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.940
What's going to happen?

27
00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:27.940
The most basic trust between people.

28
00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:30.180
I'll give you one more chance.

29
00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:31.620
Reorganization of the language

30
00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:37.540
All right.

31
00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:41.360
Wait for me in the office for the last 20 minutes.

32
00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.420
Hurry up.

33
00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:47.460
Take your car and take me to Tengwang.
