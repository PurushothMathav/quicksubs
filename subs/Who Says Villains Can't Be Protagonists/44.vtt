Hello friend.

2
00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.280
What do you think of me?

3
00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:14.520
What about the joint projects we're investing in?

4
00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:17.580
I suddenly found out that the investment company had a little problem.

5
00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.020
Find someone to investigate.

6
00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.100
Someone wants to harm our king.

7
00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:25.140
So I used the money I invested to take care of them.

8
00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:26.900
Earned little.

9
00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:30.600
Small diamonds are only 50%.

10
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.020
Small diamonds, of course.

11
00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:34.940
How to tell half not to talk anymore

12
00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:43.820
No, it's just fun and speechless. I'll find you again next time there is such a good thing as making money.

13
00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:47.700
I want to thank you all.

14
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.500
Sir, this 45 billion.

15
00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:57.760
The old man said he didn't need to enter an account.

16
00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:59.100
Let us work freely.

17
00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.860
The investment department's intention is to buy the most prestigious store in Suzhou City.

18
00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:05.840
I don't know what you mean.

19
00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.020
Yes, it's up to you.

20
00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:11.140
How is love?

21
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:12.620
I don't care.

22
00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:15.940
Then I'll step back first.

23
00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.700
Master of God's Character Class

24
00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:28.180
A truck came through his door, and he had to get up there to try it.

25
00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:31.780
He didn't tickle me this time.

26
00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.860
Hell is empty.

27
00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.580
The Dragon King in the human world.

28
00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.960
Wow.

29
00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:46.440
What's going on, boss?

30
00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.020
Has anything dirty happened in our house recently?

31
00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:50.760
My family's health is getting worse.

32
00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:52.240
Others say it's a feng shui problem.

33
00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:53.040
But I'm lame.

34
00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.120
Someone else is building our house.

35
00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:55.400
Don't sell me.

36
00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.740
Can you help me with a woman?

37
00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.000
Request task is about to open

38
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.260
But please find the hero.

39
00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.280
Success, get a reward.

40
00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:07.440
If it fails

41
00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:08.620
Just saw me kill him.

42
00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:10.500
I know that.

43
00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:13.640
The Coach

44
00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:18.900
Ah.
