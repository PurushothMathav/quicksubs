00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.400
I heard you got engaged in December.

2
00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:14.320
Congratulations.

3
00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:16.000
Finally got the wish.

4
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.900
Hello, forget about marriage.

5
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.800
Ah.

6
00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.180
Why can't you have feelings?

7
00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:33.380
Why do you care so much?

8
00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:44.740
Why are you so angry with people?

9
00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:46.460
Even though we broke up.

10
00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:48.000
But you're my ex-boyfriend.

11
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.940
I care what happens to you.

12
00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.960
No, you said yourself we broke up.

13
00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:54.940
Don't give me this.

14
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.540
I'm telling you I don't like To Mat Nguyet.

15
00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.900
I'm not going to eat this stinky grass.

16
00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.420
Right?

17
00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:05.700
But...

18
00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.020
I hear in your heart that you don't think so.

19
00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:11.360
Yes.

20
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.160
What do I think?

21
00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:18.180
This girl's just learned something -- psychology, no expression -- something he saw.

22
00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:20.840
Hey.

23
00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.020
Okay, I know.

24
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.020
My father and Nhu Long have arrived.

25
00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:27.060
Let's go up.

26
00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.580
Why do you want to continue?

27
00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.660
Dad, we're coming.

28
00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:41.940
Mutant emotions

29
00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.920
But it's not like the family can't beat you.

30
00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.060
What does the old man know?

31
00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:48.140
How to choose first

32
00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:52.860
It's okay, encounter an eyesore that doesn't work, but there's a bit of silence.

33
00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:54.160
But it's okay.

34
00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.260
Sooner or later, let him think.
