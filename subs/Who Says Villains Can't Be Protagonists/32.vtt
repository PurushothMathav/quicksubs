00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:03.700
Hey, they're just teasing you a little bit.

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.080
Who said you treated people so badly?

3
00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:08.060
I'm the cocoon for your little things.

4
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:09.820
Hum. Hum.

5
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.020
Delete the photo for me quickly, don't be so violent.

6
00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:13.860
You answer me one more question.

7
00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:15.180
I'll delete it.

8
00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.160
This time it's a serious matter.

9
00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:21.860
I recently wanted to invest in this new energy industry.

10
00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.140
What do you think?

11
00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:24.840
Back to the script.

12
00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.300
I clearly remember that this royal family is Wang s comrade who was listed in the new energy event.

13
00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:33.180
Prime Minister Tam Duong is destroying the family.

14
00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:36.080
Okay, that's the same stink.

15
00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:37.160
I'll get on the horse.

16
00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.080
The old man vowed that year.

17
00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:41.320
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

18
00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.860
That's new energy.

19
00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:49.980
The king grows in the next 10 years

20
00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.260
If you invest in this.

21
00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:54.240
Stable profit without compensation

22
00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:58.520
Well, if you say that, then I have to vote.

23
00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:02.180
It's just that the guy we work with, he's a foreign company.

24
00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.060
It's called Fares Corporation.

25
00:01:04.719 --> 00:01:06.920
I feel that their financial statements are very problematic.

26
00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:08.780
What do you think?

27
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.760
I've had some contact with him before.

28
00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:17.200
People belong at this head of this new energy field.

29
00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:22.900
Working with them, you are waiting to count the money in the next few years.

30
00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:25.240
More than a problem.

31
00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:29.760
This is the leather bag company that Ye Chen made in the blast furnace water.

32
00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:30.780
Use a flat gun.

33
00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.680
Wang Yi is a stupid bastard.

34
00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:36.860
Absolutely no escape.

35
00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.540
If you say that, there's no problem.

36
00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:45.640
I decided that this time I had to find Wang Ru Long in charge.

37
00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:46.740
What do you think?

38
00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.180
Wow.

39
00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:51.940
This is nonsense wow

40
00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:54.900
He's a mediator.

41
00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.500
God willing, this will eat the hero.

42
00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.620
Well, finally back to the north.

43
00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:04.880
Ha ha ha

44
00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.580
If you say so.

45
00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.760
Then I have to get him in now.

46
00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:12.140
Well, it's fun to talk, isn't it?

47
00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.460
There's that much money again.

48
00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.020
Finally over the mountain.

49
00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.280
He was deleted a long time ago.

50
00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:19.440
That kind of image doesn't delete.

51
00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:20.900
For example, making a gold stove.

52
00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.480
That makes sense.

53
00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.860
It can't be because I'm a scum that affects the reputation of a great beauty like you.

54
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.520
Hey, hey, hey, Miss Wang, I won't bother you anymore.

55
00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.900
You're always busy first haha

56
00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.260
Ip Than Hoang As Long Ly Tam Duong

57
00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:44.260
Look how my mother did to you.
