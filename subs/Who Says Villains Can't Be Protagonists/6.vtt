1
00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.220
Mental illness.

2
00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:02.400
Who was sacrificed for freedom

3
00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:04.720
OMG, I know what you are afraid of.

4
00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:07.160
I can't bear to take your dead gun.

5
00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:08.460
If someone dares to stop

6
00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:11.640
I let his whole family destroy cigarettes.

7
00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:13.320
I'm going, is your head wet?

8
00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.760
I've got the bodyguard down, you haven't done anything.

9
00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:18.040
Let me work with Sun Mo Yue to play me.

10
00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:20.020
I'll give you some money.

11
00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.220
Could your two grandfathers please take the high-speed rail with them?

12
00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.000
You think too much, Ip Chen.

13
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
You are just a guard of our house.

14
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.360
From now on, you're fired.

15
00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:31.380
Let's get out of here right away.

16
00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.000
The big fucking ghost plays your big head ghost.

17
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.920
I'm getting tired of the city tonight, okay?

18
00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:37.100
What's wrong with me?

19
00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.360
Mon Moon, I know you sent me away to protect me.

20
00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:42.200
But don't worry.

21
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:43.120
I'm not going.

22
00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.660
Even if I am in Heaven, I cannot touch you.

23
00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.000
Finally I will warn you again, whether you go or not, I will not go.

24
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.060
You believe me.

25
00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.660
I'll spend my whole life protecting you.

26
00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.540
Okay, here's what you said.

27
00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:06.260
Right.

28
00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.340
I kissed you, what do you think?

29
00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:09.200
Regret it.

30
00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.300
Go away.

31
00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:18.360
Get out, get out, get out, get out, get out.

32
00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.780
The power of your family is great.

33
00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.420
Looks like they caught something from the family.

34
00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:24.940
I can't take a shower.

35
00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:30.600
Can't say a word

36
00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.240
I know you have a reason.

37
00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.660
If I'm not welcome here, I can go.

38
00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:36.420
But remember.

39
00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.240
When I need you

40
00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.300
I will appear next to you for the first time.

41
00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:41.860
It starts with you.

42
00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:45.920
Wait for me, you just saw it yourself, I didn't take the initiative.

43
00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:47.420
This girl goes up on her own.

44
00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:49.380
It's not intentional.

45
00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:52.940
Oh, the road, right?

46
00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:54.980
I remember that name.

47
00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:02.180
Young master.

48
00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.840
Young master, I really can't help it.

49
00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.260
Otherwise a woman's heart is unique

50
00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.980
I'm almost done, what's wrong with you?

51
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.820
Boss, what's wrong with you?
