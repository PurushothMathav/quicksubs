00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.420
Ms. Wang was so complimentary.

2
00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:03.860
I mean, Tang Thieu came with me.

3
00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:04.720
Road Di.

4
00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:06.320
Ah.

5
00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:08.480
It's the Grand Master.

6
00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:10.480
No shame in being a Yale graduate.

7
00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:11.880
I really admire Don.

8
00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.420
But you and Snow Plague.

9
00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:15.860
Learning for 50 years.

10
00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.400
It's not like Tang lacks a backward young person with sharp eyes.

11
00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:20.640
It's embarrassing.

12
00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.440
I know you said it was Master Tang.

13
00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:25.460
Only the first man in our dorm has such talent.

14
00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.780
That's right, not like self-boasting scum.

15
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.340
It's annoying.

16
00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:34.400
Can you not take me?

17
00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.340
Don't blame the bear, right?

18
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.240
You're welcome.

19
00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:40.580
Have you forgotten one more?

20
00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.020
You said I really remember.

21
00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:44.680
Mr. Ye, right?

22
00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:46.300
If you have already bet.

23
00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.820
Is now the time to make a bet?

24
00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.400
It's been three minutes.

25
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:51.440
Do you have anything else to say?

26
00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:56.020
Jiang Shen Di was clearly reminded by Ms. Wang to try to save her for the second time.

27
00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:57.160
How can I count as losing?

28
00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:58.520
Whether it's a secondary deformation or not

29
00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:00.260
Jiang Chen is still an old man.

30
00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:01.080
The month is in effect

31
00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:02.080
What else are you preparing?

32
00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:04.960
Yeah, get on your knees and crawl out.

33
00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:06.460
Get out! Get out!

34
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:10.900
That's great.

35
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.000
Everybody.

36
00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.880
Mr. Ip is absolutely not a fraud.

37
00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.400
It's talent that's born with real bravery.

38
00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:20.800
I just wanted to introduce him to his sister.

39
00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.400
Want him to be a big help to our royal family.

40
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.440
Of course you're a martial artist.

41
00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:28.980
Even if art takes away names, seniors are rare talents.

42
00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:31.700
Miss Wang has my help.

43
00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.500
It will surely make you Dang Wang the first wonder of the world several times.

44
00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:37.780
Has anyone ever told you anything?

45
00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.460
Write to listen

46
00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:42.340
The way you laugh is disgusting.
