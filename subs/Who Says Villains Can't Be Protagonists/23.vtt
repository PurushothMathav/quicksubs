1
00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.460
How is my grandfather's situation?

2
00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:05.280
Please Ms. Wang calm down.

3
00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:07.820
Waiting for the old man to feel a pulse or two

4
00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:10.940
Your grandfather's disease, you can be sure.

5
00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:14.640
It's a little low, isn't it?

6
00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:17.340
I mean, it's almost under control.

7
00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:18.600
It's not Kui, it's Ip.

8
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.380
Are you worried that the big thing doesn't work out?

9
00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.540
You say there's nothing bad about people like Gia Cat.

10
00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.080
People live better than their widows.

11
00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:28.540
There is no such thing as your disease.

12
00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.660
How can I make Wang Yixing's hood?

13
00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:36.880
What the hell is that?

14
00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:39.200
Veins blocked by stroke

15
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.380
Plus some other viral hemiplegia.

16
00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.520
But it's not a big deal.

17
00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.060
I can use the thirteenth needle of the demon to clear the channel.

18
00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:49.380
Jiang Than applied for the sentence

19
00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.580
If you're going to heal with thirteen magic needles

20
00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.100
I'm afraid Mr. Wang is only 200%.
