00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.300
It's not your turn to handle it yet.

2
00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.120
Didn't this person disturb the Tang Su couple's engagement party before?

3
00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.520
Maybe she wants to protect him?

4
00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:09.480
Who knows?

5
00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:10.560
Big family thing.

6
00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:11.440
It's a very chaotic river.

7
00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:17.400
What's more, I think 90% of men and women's feelings are because of deep hatred.

8
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.940
He had an affair with this man.

9
00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:22.940
Sumo Moon, this girl is good.

10
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.180
The party hasn t started yet, just kiss the Dragon King s family.

11
00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.220
Instead, it's saving his brother's activities.

12
00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.260
Cousin, what's this?

13
00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:33.500
Does this trash need maintenance?

14
00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:35.820
The Red Moon

15
00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:39.560
I can handle this little thing.

16
00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:41.640
The reason I told you not to let him handle you.

17
00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:47.420
It s because I want to see a shameless person like you show up here.

18
00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:53.200
Red moon, what are you talking about? Are you saying that the entire top floor of Tu Cat Van Dien is packed by you?

19
00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.940
Send me the birthday user, do I have anyone else besides me?

20
00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:59.880
It's shameless.

21
00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:01.040
Let me tell you something.

22
00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.160
The contractor here is the general director of Long Than Group.

23
00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:05.780
His name is Deaf.

24
00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.380
Don't tell me I saw him.

25
00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.940
Just checking his information online is a small thing.

26
00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:12.500
A small guard.

27
00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.260
Dare to impersonate here.

28
00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.520
You have the guts.

29
00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:20.300
Deaf people, you'd better ask if I'm still married to the red world without you.

30
00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:22.200
This makes you pretend.

31
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.140
You think that in your name and the Dragon God Group, you carry a death god that can arbitrarily climb your relatives.

32
00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.840
Is it funny that I am To Thuan Trung and my dragon curse is not my home?

33
00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.780
Ha ha ha ha ha

34
00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.100
Stupid.

35
00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.460
In your opinion, the boss is extremely mysterious.

36
00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.020
Just my hero.

37
00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:45.440
Moon, you are worthless, I don t blame you, I will give you a bigger surprise later.

38
00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.620
Let me show you my power.

39
00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.300
You're such a clown.

40
00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.920
Someone ordered this fake for me.

41
00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.320
The owner.

42
00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:55.920
If you want to survive.

43
00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.100
I advise you to think carefully before you act.

44
00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:00.160
Who are you?

45
00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:02.020
This man is the bodyguard.

46
00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.080
Sing one and

47
00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:04.800
Liar, who are you threatening?

48
00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.860
You'll know soon enough.

49
00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.420
The man at the door was very handsome.

50
00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.900
It's not Mr. Long Nha, the president of Long Than Group.
