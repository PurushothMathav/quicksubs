00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:03.960
What's the matter? Find the dead man from the kiss.

2
00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:07.460
If you play evil like that, you will not go.

3
00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:08.860
Let's do it.

4
00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:10.660
My brother allowed me today.

5
00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:13.400
Touching a brother in '82

6
00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.500
Don't think I have a two-heart relationship.

7
00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:18.480
What do you think?

8
00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.060
We've been struggling for years to get together.

9
00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:23.000
How can I refuse to kiss you?

10
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.660
And we've been dating our whole lives at a birthday party, haven't we?

11
00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:29.420
Well, do I look right?

12
00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.800
I've heard before that Miss Su's three-year journey has been unsuccessful.

13
00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.260
What's the news after today?

14
00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:40.680
Two days ago, two people kissed at her birthday party.

15
00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.420
The first beauty must be worthy of the first kung fu.

16
00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:49.000
I don't have to watch you drink alone.

17
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.420
So come and drink with you

18
00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.160
To the moon bath

19
00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.240
Are you okay?

20
00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:55.640
Can you call the moon too?

21
00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:56.500
Oh.

22
00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.880
Sister-in-law

23
00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:59.200
Hey.

24
00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:04.160
Honey, someone's already with you.

25
00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.360
Drink wherever you want to go.

26
00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.900
Don't interrupt my appointment with Miss Lin.

27
00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:10.920
You can drink yours.

28
00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:11.960
I don't care about you.

29
00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.860
When you are tired of playing, can we go home together?

30
00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:16.720
Oh, I'm leaving.

31
00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:18.240
Pick up a girl in front of her fiancÃ©.

32
00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.420
Master Hai Hoang.

33
00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:21.540
Jia what?

34
00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.880
I gave every girl in the world a home.

35
00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.400
Do you understand Mission 35?

36
00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.180
You have to go.

37
00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:31.280
Hurry up.

38
00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:32.120
Give me a slap.

39
00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:33.060
Make these things clear.

40
00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:34.620
sitting cube

41
00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.580
We've been clean lately.

42
00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:46.300
Since Tang Du has been around for so many years, it was to check on you that I caused you to suffer so much commission.

43
00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.740
From now on, do whatever you want, okay?

44
00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:54.420
I want you to be the happiest man in the world.
