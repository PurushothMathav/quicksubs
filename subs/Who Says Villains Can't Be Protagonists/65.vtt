00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:03.740
What are you doing?

2
00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:09.680
Um, Ms. Qin said he has a project he wants to talk to me about.

3
00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:11.900
So I came in and asked me to talk about the project.

4
00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:13.880
Isn't that right, Xiaoming?

5
00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:15.340
Uh, yeah, yeah.

6
00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.080
My brother and sister are here to talk.

7
00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:19.580
Talk.

8
00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:23.680
Is there red wine all over the floor?

9
00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:27.100
Having a good conversation, it's natural to want to open a celebratory bottle of wine.

10
00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.600
Cham is really fun.

11
00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.400
That's why I spilled wine all over the floor.

12
00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.220
Fish soup just helped me clean up.

13
00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.260
We're going to wash a little together.

14
00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.180
Take a shower, this hotel also has a men's and women's bathroom, don't you know?

15
00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:47.100
No, no, no, I swear there's absolutely nothing to wash on the pillow.

16
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.300
This is going to be a porridge pot.

17
00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.620
In your conscience, I didn't do anything.

18
00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.420
I can't believe the jade did this.

19
00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.380
Come on, there's a meeting coming up.

20
00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.980
Miss Wang, please show some self-respect.

21
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.900
Don't always think about someone else's fiancé.

22
00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:06.340
Someone else's fiancé.

23
00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:08.540
So you tell him to tell me one at first.

24
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.780
How old are you, do you still remember the arranged marriage?

25
00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:13.640
Hey.

26
00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:20.300
Guys, either we walk normally, we can't.
