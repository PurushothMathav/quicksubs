00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.700
General Director Wang

2
00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:03.520
This is clearly a trap.

3
00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:05.340
Why do you still understand and do it?

4
00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:06.900
You tell General Director Wang

5
00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:10.700
Fars Group as a partner is also obliged to contribute 30 billion VND.

6
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.340
Let him push a little.

7
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.000
Hey.

8
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.040
So that's it.

9
00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:17.040
I get it.

10
00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:19.900
Cross-border money transfers delayed by one day

11
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.520
You want to fight the time difference, fight the Night God with one hand.

12
00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:26.140
You are so hidden.

13
00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.800
Got it, not fast yet, yeah yeah yeah

14
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.060
I'm going.

15
00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:36.480
General Director Wang, you came at the right time to help me see the shareholder relations of Valls Corporation.

16
00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.020
Who is the largest tumor?

17
00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.320
It's a company called Long Than Group.

18
00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.340
More than 50% of the stock is him.

19
00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:43.820
Talk to the finance department tomorrow.

20
00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:46.480
Use that 50 billion to buy Dragon God drums.

21
00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:47.500
All right, Mr. Wang.

22
00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:48.320
There's one more thing.

23
00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:50.020
The underdog said he wanted to see you.

24
00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.380
Let him in.

25
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:05.600
Yes.

26
00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:07.880
What are you looking for me to talk about?

27
00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.760
I've got to go to bed.

28
00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.340
What's urgent?

29
00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.300
My two friends and I are also the point.

30
00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.020
You're my ex-boyfriend again.

31
00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:18.860
Looking for a friend to talk to ex. What's going on?

32
00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.520
Chasing.

33
00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.340
A little measurement.

34
00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:24.620
Let's talk business.

35
00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.320
Do useless things for what?

36
00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:28.340
This woman is not right.

37
00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.200
All right.

38
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.000
I know that my son is a busy man.

39
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.580
I'm not going in circles anymore.

40
00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.100
Recently, Dang Vuong Group plans to do a new project.

41
00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.060
300 missing.

42
00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.140
I'd like to draw you in and invest together.

43
00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:47.860
300 billion is not a small amount.

44
00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.240
You also know that you want to get engaged recently to Toulouse.

45
00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.700
My father took me more seriously.

46
00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:56.540
So, he was afraid that I would spend it indiscriminately before marriage.

47
00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.220
Set this transfer amount

48
00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.100
Less pressure.

49
00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.020
It's got to be about new energy.

50
00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.180
The three of you spent money to destroy the disaster.

51
00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:07.840
Buy him a peace of mind.

52
00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.420
But this so-called lady by the way welcomed the Dragon King's harem.

53
00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:12.940
I'll be safe.

54
00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.720
Haha, don't worry.

55
00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.320
I've checked the partner's details.

56
00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:21.180
It is very stable, you can invest with me.

57
00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.100
Ensure you make a steady profit without compensation

58
00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:24.720
So if you say so...

59
00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.480
Then I'll choose to trust you.

60
00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.180
I'll find someone to call you later.

61
00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:31.940
Okay, it's definitely a win-win for us.

62
00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:35.320
Win / Win
