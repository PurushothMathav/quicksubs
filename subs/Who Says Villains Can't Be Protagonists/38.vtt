00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.320
Well, now I know it's wrong.

2
00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:05.380
It's late.

3
00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:07.960
I'll have to go to the bathroom with Ms. Lin later.

4
00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:10.140
Don't scan Lao Tzu's letter.

5
00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:14.520
It's okay, you guys go.

6
00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:17.240
I'll wait for you here, even if I can tell you.

7
00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:19.000
Are you really that one?

8
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.780
This one doesn't make any difference to my kid, man, are you low on blood sugar?

9
00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:23.960
Eat something.

10
00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.180
Be yourself.

11
00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:30.060
Let's go.

12
00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:41.160
The road that I mentioned just now is not this place. Don't mention it, don't mention it.

13
00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.340
I'm totally out to deal with Su Mou Moon's smelly woman.

14
00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:46.860
You don't even have to let Miss Lin protect me.

15
00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:49.480
It's all insulting to this Rolex.

16
00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:50.980
I'll compensate you for a mistake.

17
00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:53.300
Girls who understand things as you like them.

18
00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.480
Won't open my mouth, my mouth is full of money.

19
00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:01.500
The kind of woman who targets my money like Su Moc Moon is boring.

20
00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:04.040
Isn't the rumor that you two are engaged?

21
00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.540
Family pressure.

22
00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.800
You feel like this kind of moon every day with a face that slashes her dead.

23
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.740
It's like the world owes him hundreds of millions.

24
00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:14.240
Wow.

25
00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:17.420
That girl would dare to hit you.

26
00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:20.660
But talk about

27
00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.400
This peaceful spirit of Ye Chen is cheap.

28
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.000
The self-organizing woman is one who will not forget.

29
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.600
Especially for them to perform tasks that can't be completed.

30
00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.620
According to this issue, Lam Ham is often pounded by him.

31
00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:41.500
Lee Piano.

32
00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.660
You're welcome. I just remembered something important.

33
00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.900
Oh good that.

34
00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.200
It was nice talking to you today.

35
00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.320
But I had to go back to deal with the smelly old lady in Su Moyuan, talk a little bit about kissing.

36
00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.660
Invite you to drink the other day.

37
00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:54.940
Thank you. Thank you.

38
00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.300
Now it seems

39
00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.000
It's true that there have been two very dangerous activities before.

40
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.340
If the Dragon King didn't arrive in time.

41
00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:11.260
I must die.

42
00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.500
But all of this.

43
00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.900
It was all calculated by the Dragon King first.
