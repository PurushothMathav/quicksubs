00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:02.140
Your stuff.

2
00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.900
If you want to cut this precious picture of me

3
00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:06.560
Mr. Ip.

4
00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:07.560
You do that.

5
00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.920
It's not just going to drag you to the blacklist.

6
00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:12.240
They will demand ten times more compensation by force.

7
00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:13.200
Please respect yourself.

8
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.140
Why are you so nervous?

9
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:19.800
It's okay.

10
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.300
Otherwise, dying 100 times is not enough.

11
00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:24.440
The word okay is still the biggest thing.

12
00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:27.140
Dongpo's words were more than 1,000 years ago.

13
00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.660
To keep it intact

14
00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.080
The first task is insect control.

15
00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.740
And the only consequence of doing these two things is that plotter paper is extremely flammable.

16
00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.940
Look where I just burned it.

17
00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.260
There's not even a trace of it.

18
00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.240
Why is this paper fireproof?

19
00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:44.580
I asked everyone.

20
00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.540
1000 years ago there would have been fire protection.

21
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:48.820
There is only one function.

22
00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.340
This picture is fake.

23
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:55.560
Mr. Ye.

24
00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:56.980
He's a master, of course.

25
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.380
Where even I can't see, you've discovered.

26
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.300
He checked for flaws in the page paint.

27
00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:05.700
This is the last party.

28
00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.540
This is the highest performance certificate of page paint.

29
00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:15.220
Mr. Ye could come here unhindered at any time in the future.

30
00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:24.900
Rest in peace.

31
00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.160
Master Ip just saw that I have eyes that do not know Thai Son.

32
00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:30.500
I want to worship you as a teacher.

33
00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:31.860
Please accept it.

34
00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:34.540
Mr. Ip just now I have a helpless eye.

35
00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:36.360
There's 10 million on this card.

36
00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.180
It's a little bit of your mind.

37
00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:39.140
Go up there.

38
00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:41.500
No need.

39
00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:43.700
Everyone comes to take heart.

40
00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.140
Small or certain skills

41
00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:48.500
If you really want to thank me

42
00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:49.680
It's closed in a minute.

43
00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.180
Don't bid on me.

44
00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.020
Absolutely.

45
00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:06.380
Maybe it is.

46
00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:08.180
According to human feeling

47
00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:09.720
Inborn Ky

48
00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.380
Just hide it here.

49
00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.320
This work is the work of a master jade sculptor.

50
00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.900
And from which master?

51
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.440
Excuse me.

52
00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:21.640
We can't investigate.

53
00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.700
But I think his artistic value is quite high.

54
00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.160
So the starting price is five million.

55
00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:29.540
Interested guests?

56
00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:30.920
Maybe try it.

57
00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:32.980
Maybe we can pick up a missing one.
