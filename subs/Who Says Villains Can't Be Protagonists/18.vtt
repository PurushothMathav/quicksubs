00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.720
Mr. Zhang Jing, don t you have to talk about Mr. Ye when you meet Mr. Ye?

2
00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:04.000
Although the old man

3
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.520
But the owner's eyesight is still there.

4
00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:09.700
I think some people just up here call deer horses.

5
00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.520
Try to return the work of others to yourself.

6
00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:14.820
I thought it was a hidden boss.

7
00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:19.360
I can't believe it's naked butt pulling wood, spinning shame circles ha ha

8
00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:23.580
This plot has to compile a skit to show the spring festival gala, the audience ratings are absolutely explosive.

9
00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.820
I rely on this old man to pull even greater hatred than Wang Dufa.

10
00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:29.640
It's the owner.

11
00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.820
Right?

12
00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.240
Ownership of the Seven Star Hotel - Kim Van Dinh

13
00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:36.580
And the unconditional obedience of a mysterious figure.

14
00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:38.700
This dog on the street.

15
00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:39.560
You.

16
00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.600
Tell me about a hypnotic ghost.

17
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.060
You can be like that

18
00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:44.800
Mr. Zhang Ruo Diep

19
00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.240
Why is there half a lie in my picture?

20
00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.940
This birthday party is not organized by you.

21
00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:51.720
I never invited you.

22
00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:54.280
You two are unwelcome guests.

23
00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:55.980
Get out of here now.

24
00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.080
Ye Chen, you promised me before that you would do things like Death Grace and get quick transfer points.

25
00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:05.220
Otherwise, disappear from my face forever.

26
00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:06.760
I hope you are the one who can do what you say.

27
00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:08.020
Okay, rain.

28
00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:11.500
I'll tell you soon who's the best option for you.

29
00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:17.060
Similarly, today the owner will pay a hundred times more.

30
00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:19.600
Go.

31
00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.860
Boss, I didn't do anything.
