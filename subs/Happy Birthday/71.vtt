1
00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:03.040
Mom, I can't drink either.

2
00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:04.480
Why did you drink two glasses?

3
00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:05.400
You drink first.

4
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.380
I'm going out for a minute.

5
00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.460
Then let's play.

6
00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:14.860
Insurance is finally back.

7
00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.220
I didn't die last time.

8
00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:18.180
So this time it's your turn.

9
00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:20.860
Practice makes perfect.

10
00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:23.220
Getting you more and more hands-on.

11
00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:34.140
God, open it up for me.

12
00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:38.820
Aren't you very good at cutting?

13
00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:40.780
This time I'll let you cut enough.

14
00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:43.580
Well, don't worry.

15
00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.000
The medicine will arrive later.

16
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.460
Someone's with you.

17
00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.260
Director Shen, what's going on?

18
00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:02.900
Isn't he the guy at the bar?

19
00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:04.060
Why is he here?

20
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.100
He's a killer.

21
00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:07.280
Kill.

22
00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:08.740
Assassin

23
00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:10.820
How is that possible?

24
00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.540
How could such a beautiful girl be an assassin?

25
00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.100
Then you have to ask Lieu Dai Trang.

26
00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:24.440
You watch him.

27
00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:25.860
If he dares to cut the rope

28
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.200
Beat to death.

29
00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:28.220
Directly abandoning the public.
