00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:09.380
What, your drinking ability is so bad.

2
00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:11.780
If you drink two glasses like that, you go to the bathroom and vomit.

3
00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:13.580
Come on, let's keep going.

4
00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.700
Tell me who told you to kill me.

5
00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:27.420
General Director Shen, your brother

6
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:28.660
Get out.

7
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.100
Everybody out to enjoy.

8
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:31.860
Stay.

9
00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:35.080
Don't make me shoot you.

10
00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:36.520
I really don't know anything.

11
00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.060
Is there a misunderstanding you're pointing a gun at me?

12
00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.580
Hum, hum.

13
00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:45.760
You killed me.

14
00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:48.880
There's a lot of people out there looking at you and thinking you can escape.

15
00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:50.360
This doesn't bother you anymore.

16
00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.280
Our industry wants to change something very simple.

17
00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.220
Wait, can you tell me before I die?

18
00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:58.960
Who wants to kill me?

19
00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:00.460
Wanted to trick me.

20
00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.020
You're a little immature.

21
00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:04.620
Go down wondering
