1
00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.120
I know how much I weigh.

2
00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:04.480
I had nothing to do with it.

3
00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:07.800
I can't win the bank project.

4
00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.300
But I don't understand.

5
00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:11.460
You are young and strong.

6
00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:14.060
I see infinite possibilities in you.

7
00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:16.320
So you chose me.

8
00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.920
Exactly. That's why I chose you.

9
00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:20.760
Then into your life.

10
00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.100
What about me?

11
00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:23.420
There's a problem.

12
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.680
No matter how big or small the company is, I don't care.

13
00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:31.500
I just like to wait until the fruit is a little ripe how to remove it.

14
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.260
It's a sense of accomplishment.

15
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.020
What I want to know, I already know.

16
00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:41.780
Shoot.

17
00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:46.240
No hurry, there is still some time before dawn.

18
00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:48.280
I'd love to talk to you.

19
00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.100
I especially have a sense of accomplishment when I step on people like you.

20
00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.240
Aren't you an assassin?

21
00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:56.220
Shoot me.

22
00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.020
There's no courage.

23
00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:59.600
I take money to work.

24
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.260
It's not me who decides to live and die.

25
00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:10.520
I'm not afraid.

26
00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:11.600
Be honest.

27
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.480
In fact, she was already sleeping in my bed.

28
00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:16.620
I just don't want to expose you.

29
00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.900
Even if I die, I'll make your head blue.

30
00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:22.820
Like this dress one color.
