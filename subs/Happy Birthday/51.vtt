1
00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:09.020
Director Shen, you just fired.

2
00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:10.780
The Sheriff's Department is here, are you okay?

3
00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:12.640
We all belong to the emperor himself.

4
00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:13.600
That's right, Jing.

5
00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:14.980
I want to ask you something.

6
00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:17.640
He's selling shares, you know?

7
00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.020
What, this is good, why does the CEO want to sell the shares?

8
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.080
The Sea of Clouds project is currently under development.

9
00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:24.760
It will sell much faster now.

10
00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:26.180
Because of his brother.

11
00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.840
I've heard Daiqiang talk about his brother.

12
00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:32.620
We have used our relationship to deal with this issue, but the Hai Nhuan Group has not let go.

13
00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:34.380
The project plan leaked early.

14
00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:35.760
Reparation is inevitable.

15
00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.820
The project plan leaked early.

16
00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:40.380
Hai Nhuan Group is a long-standing enterprise

17
00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.900
Such a low-level mistake cannot be made.

18
00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:45.960
But Hai Nhuan Group always insists that it is Truong Dung's fault.

19
00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.120
I consulted a lawyer.

20
00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.900
All this evidence combined, we don't stand any chance.

21
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.840
No, Zhang Liang has devoted so many years to the company.

22
00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:54.580
This finally keeps the clouds open.

23
00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:55.700
I want to see my father-in-law.

24
00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.980
You can't be dragged into the abyss because of your brother.

25
00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:02.780
We have to find a way, the project of Hai Nhuan Group was cut off by a man called Sao Group.

26
00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.100
We just need to find the boss, we'll know everything.

27
00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:09.420
I'll check this out. It's called Star Corporation. It seems to be a registered shell company.

28
00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:11.540
The boss's name is Ta Van Long.

29
00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.260
Okay, when this is over, we'll see him.

30
00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:19.100
What are you laughing at?

31
00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.960
Laughing you sunny handsome and upright

32
00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:24.860
If it wasn't for Liao Dazhuang

33
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.500
I can chase you.
