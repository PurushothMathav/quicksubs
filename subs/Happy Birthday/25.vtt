00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:06.620
You really are a ghost.

2
00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.160
Asson, stop working tonight.

3
00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:11.260
The rest will come tomorrow, Asong.

4
00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:14.340
Take Jolin home.

5
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.920
Yes, it's 11 o'clock, and the company lights are off.

6
00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:44.720
Me...

7
00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:46.520
There are many rooms in the company.

8
00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:47.620
I'll see how you find it.

9
00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.100
Just get through this damn cycle

10
00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:51.620
I immediately transferred to the Department of Homeland Security.

11
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:53.380
I'm going.

12
00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.580
Damn, I left my phone in the car.
