00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:03.660
Uncle, I have a way for you to hold on.

2
00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:05.720
Come for me, why?

3
00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:07.580
My sister in the house is still waiting for me.

4
00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:09.820
Hey, Dragon, why are you going?

5
00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:15.700
What's wrong with Shen Lang?

6
00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:17.600
What does the phone do for me?

7
00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.060
Your phone is a personal item.

8
00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:21.460
Hey, hey.

9
00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:23.260
Let me out!

10
00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:27.060
You're just expecting something to happen to me.

11
00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:28.320
If I have nothing tonight

12
00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.440
I have a job tomorrow.

13
00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:30.520
He's paying attention to me.

14
00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:32.440
Don't allow him to contact the outside world.

15
00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:33.980
If he dares to run...

16
00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:35.580
Wet his feet.

17
00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:39.440
Shen Lang, what the hell are you doing?

18
00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:40.380
Let me go.

19
00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:44.460
Let go!

20
00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.780
Let's see what else you're relying on this time.

21
00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:54.280
Hey brother, what are you doing with Zhang Liang? We are still waiting for your birthday.

22
00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:55.120
Come back.

23
00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:56.400
I have something very important to do tonight.

24
00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:57.520
I'll be back first.

25
00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:58.520
You're not coming back, are you?

26
00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:02.060
The beauties in the other room I can laugh alone.

27
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.740
Zhang Liang, Zhang Liang.

28
00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:11.900
Of course it's you.
