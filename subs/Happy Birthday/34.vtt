00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:01.940
Ha ha ha dry

2
00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:04.620
Now I've identified the target.

3
00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.100
The woman next to him is the killer.

4
00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:09.580
But what good is it if I know where the gun is?

5
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.060
He dared to kill me but did not dare to kill him.

6
00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:13.460
You can't fight back.

7
00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:14.620
I can't run again.

8
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.380
I have no grudge against him.

9
00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:21.640
He's the one who's hurt enough to want to kill me, not that he has the guts, that man.

10
00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:23.580
I remember. He's eating here.

11
00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:32.560
General Director Shen is awake.

12
00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:33.940
Maybe have another drink.

13
00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:36.400
What's your name?

14
00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:41.080
My name is Bo, and you died a few minutes later, Chief Justice, what did you say?

15
00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:42.860
How can I poison?

16
00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:50.060
Haha, so I want you to go and have a drink, and I have already drunk it.

17
00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:54.020
Can you drink it and taste it?

18
00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:57.620
Cheers.

19
00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.080
I admit you're very capable.

20
00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:06.840
I knew something was going to happen to this I drank, and I didn't know when you poisoned it.

21
00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.740
But I don't have time for this.

22
00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:11.220
Ah.

23
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.340
Ha ha ha ha ha

24
00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.260
His name is Moni, right?

25
00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:27.500
Right.

26
00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.940
I'm waiting for you.

27
00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:38.620
Six dollars for three minutes.

28
00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:41.860
I'll wait for you at the company.
