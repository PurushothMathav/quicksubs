00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.300
OK, I'll get it for you right now.

2
00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:06.540
Wait a minute, I'll go with you.

3
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:09.260
Okay.

4
00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:13.380
That's right, Shen Lang.

5
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.100
Excuse me.

6
00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.540
It's your birthday, I have a surprise for you at the bar.

7
00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.940
I can't believe something like that happened, Kim.

8
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:24.060
I received the gift you gave me.

9
00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:26.000
When did you receive it?

10
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.860
I have received it countless times, every time I am happy.

11
00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:36.940
Didn t you decide to give it to me as a gift?

12
00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:38.820
How do you know?

13
00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.940
Guess what.

14
00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:41.780
Let's go.

15
00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:43.120
Go.

16
00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:48.940
You said you got stuck in the loop countless times.

17
00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.880
Time has entered the second day of today.

18
00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:55.780
I think we should get out of this fucking cycle.

19
00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:57.060
You.

20
00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.620
Trust me.

21
00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:00.900
I believe you.

22
00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.840
I hate that this is supervised.

23
00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.260
Do I have to prove it later?

24
00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.540
Why are you here?
