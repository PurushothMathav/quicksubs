00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:05.520
Hungry?

5
00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.940
Having worked overtime until now, the temper is a little hungry, their meal must have been bad for you.

6
00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:11.240
This one's for you.

7
00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:12.820

Why are you here?

15
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:43.440
I went back to get a document.

16
00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:44.340
