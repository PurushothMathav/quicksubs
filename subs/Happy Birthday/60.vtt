00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:03.420
Let go of me.

2
00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.020
Let me kill you, are you fucking stupid?

3
00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:09.600
Who is this guy?

4
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:11.720
Don't take any faith out of my mouth.

5
00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:13.940
Didn't say anything.

6
00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.100
You called here.

7
00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.020
If there is no mission, it is completed.

8
00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:22.980
The remaining funds will be transferred to your card.

9
00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.120
Don't contact me later, sorry.

10
00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:27.560
Your people can't complete your mission.

11
00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:29.960
I hope his mouth is harder than his pliers.

12
00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:31.740
Not to teach you who to be?

13
00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.980
You sent someone to kill me, and you asked who I was.

14
00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.660
I have absolutely no idea what you're talking about.

15
00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.220
I'm just a liaison.

16
00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.180
Ha ha ha

17
00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.540
You want any feeling in my mouth, a total waste of time.

18
00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.220
Don't say yes.

19
00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:00.520
Hey, Mr. Shen is having fun.

20
00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.920
Don't bother him, General Director Chen, what are you doing?

21
00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:04.660
It's your birthday.

22
00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.380
The vice president prepares cakes for you.

23
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.220
I didn't expect you to play like that, thank you Kim.
