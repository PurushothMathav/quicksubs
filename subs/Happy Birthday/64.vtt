00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.140
Hey.

2
00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:05.320
Big Column

3
00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:08.640
Is there a secret on your phone?

4
00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:09.960
It's no secret.

5
00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.420
I'll make a phone call for you, and I'll definitely look good for you.

6
00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:13.880
Don't push.

7
00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:15.140
Go ahead.

8
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.940
The three of us worked together for five years.

9
00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.260
Everything you have is a gift from your brain.

10
00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.100
Wait a minute.

11
00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:27.540
This nonsense between you and Chen Jing, I can open one eye and close one eye.

12
00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.560
But you can't touch Lao Tzu's mobile phone resolutely.

13
00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:31.460
Don't be strong.

14
00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.540
I didn't do anything to anyone.

15
00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:36.620
A list at the top of the company.

16
00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:38.760
I'm afraid a lot of men are already sleeping.

17
00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.100
You look at the bed, don't mess around.

18
00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:42.240
Deputy Director Chen, he's not that.

19
00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:43.220
Packing what?

20
00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.000
He's often in and out of your office.

21
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.340
What good product are you?

22
00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:47.680
Don't think I don't know.

23
00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.160
Amarjong, what the hell did you hear me say?

24
00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.220
What?

25
00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:53.880
You've been complimenting him lately as someone who has.

26
00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.680
I'm afraid I'm already salivating.

27
00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:58.900
I'm telling you.

28
00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:00.400
Her mother loves to play.

29
00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:01.420
I want you to manage him.

30
00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:05.380
Let me know if anyone wants to help you out today.

31
00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:07.660
It's impossible.

32
00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:09.940
Don't bother me here.

33
00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:11.800
The rest of your story will be told later.

34
00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.680
What I want to know now is

35
00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.380
Was the killer behind you hired by you?
