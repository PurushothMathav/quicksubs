00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:05.660
This is this is this is an insurance friend of mine.

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.100
Don't pay attention to him.

3
00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:09.740
Your friend's phone doesn't note life.

4
00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:13.180
After all, selling insurance.

5
00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:15.460
Still the middleman.

6
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.500
Which intermediary?

7
00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.220
No, what?

8
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.220
What's in it for you to hurt me?

9
00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.060
He is the director of the Sea of Clouds project.

10
00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:29.000
If you die

11
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.180
This project can't be done.

12
00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:34.660
Yes, my brother is right.

13
00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:37.380
If you die, it's no use to him.

14
00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.220
Shen Lang, are you wrong?

15
00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.500
If I'm not mistaken, I know.

16
00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.040
Master Lieu, is the mission over?

17
00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.420
It's over.

18
00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:11.940
If it wasn't you.
