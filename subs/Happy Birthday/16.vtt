1
00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:16.620
Right.

2
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.960
Mr. Shen, who have you sinned against?

3
00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.040
Why would anyone want to kill you?

4
00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:21.100
I don't know.

5
00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.160
Maybe our Van Hai project has committed a crime.

6
00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.140
There's this possibility.

7
00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:25.940
Van Hai project worth hundreds of billions

8
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.640
Countless people miss him.

9
00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.440
You are the general manager of this project.

10
00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:32.620
Some extremists will definitely take extraordinary measures.

11
00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.280
If Shen Song dies

12
00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:35.660
This project is no longer invited.

13
00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.500
Why can we only find it again?

14
00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:39.820
Right.

15
00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.040
Big trees catch the wind

16
00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.380
Our project is complete.

17
00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:43.920
Not just all the boys.

18
00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.620
The whole size is increased.

19
00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.380
Every step we took was like walking on thin ice.

20
00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.080
Let's live through the night safely.

21
00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:51.940
Stay at home in your comfort.

22
00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:53.740
I've got to get some rest.

23
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:07.260
General Review

24
00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.600
Can you lend me a fun outfit?

25
00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.320
I only have this on me.

26
00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:13.500
I'll get you one.

27
00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.120
There are no women's clothes in the house.

28
00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:17.620
You wear mine first.

29
00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:26.340
I only have this.

30
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.600
Today birthday does not give you the process.

31
00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.820
I have prepared a special birthday gift for you.
