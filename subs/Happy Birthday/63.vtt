00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:05.120
Master.

2
00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:08.220
The killer has a way of opening the handcuffs.

3
00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:10.420
More dangerous than a rope.

4
00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:12.180
If not, two fights.

5
00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.980
This time I told you to shoot, you see how he runs.

6
00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:18.060
I'm more familiar with the future of the company than the bar.

7
00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:19.860
Or is the company a little safer?

8
00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.420
I'm going out for a minute.

9
00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:42.460
Uncle, lend me your phone to call Chi An Department, my phone battery is out.

10
00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:48.140
I'll call.

11
00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.000
Give me the phone.

12
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.760
Right on time. What are you doing?

13
00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.540
This is not a joke.

14
00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:56.880
You put it down for me.

15
00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:59.380
I'm just using your phone.

16
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:00.580
What are you excited about?

17
00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.240
I'm not worried.

18
00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.220
Didn't I just want to call you for you?

19
00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:13.460
Wait a minute.
