00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.400
Shenna, this gun is his.

2
00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:03.480
I took it.

3
00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:05.620
He's a killer, why did he come to kill me?

4
00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:08.840
Shen Tu, isn't this the girl at the bar?

5
00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:11.680
What's so beautiful about this?

6
00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:12.920
To be an assassin.

7
00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:15.100
What's wrong? Here's my friend.

8
00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:17.280
Magistrate, are you okay?

9
00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:18.680
The one with the problem is him.

10
00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:20.320
I've called the sheriff's department.

11
00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:21.840
There was no blood before they arrived.

12
00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.340
You can get this.

13
00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:25.220
Looks like he's the killer.

14
00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:26.120
Big Column

15
00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.560
Do I remember you giving him the card?

16
00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.240
Would you let this thing sleep next to you?

17
00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.580
It's not that I didn't know he was the killer, I wanted to know he was the killer, give me eight guts I wouldn't dare.

18
00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.760
Who sent you to burn my pimples?

19
00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.360
You're tied up and injured.

20
00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:41.760
I advise you to speak earlier.

21
00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.140
From the difficulties of the flesh

22
00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.220
I advise you to think carefully before you speak.

23
00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.660
Otherwise I wouldn't mind cutting an extra hole in your other leg.

24
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.300
Just stay here.

25
00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.260
If you want to run again

26
00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.060
Next time I'll shoot you in the head.

27
00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.860
Kim came out with me for a moment.
