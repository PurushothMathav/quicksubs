00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:01.120
Shen Lang

2
00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:03.240
Let him go.

3
00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.180
He has abandoned this mission.

4
00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:07.960
Can't take my life for a joke

5
00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:09.560
He will really move.

6
00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:11.940
He can't escape without moving.

7
00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:16.520
Master, your uncle's.

8
00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:19.220
I only have this one life I can't play ah

9
00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:21.460
That's enough time.

10
00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.160
You're gonna be okay.

11
00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.060
Even if there's a one in 10 chance I'll kill him.

12
00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:28.760
What?

13
00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:30.960
Something big can't happen.

14
00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:31.920
He's hurt.

15
00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.380
Let him go. Let him go.

16
00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:35.320
He can't escape from the Bureau of Grace.

17
00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:36.240
I know in my heart

18
00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:38.120
You can't let him go.

19
00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:39.380
Big, nothing can happen.

20
00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.000
You protect big or you protect the killer.

21
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.720
We've been together for so many years, man.

22
00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:45.420
You still don't believe in my personality

23
00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.080
Don't you just let me go

24
00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:50.340
You can't, big brother. You can't. Get up.
