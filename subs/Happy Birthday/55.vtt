00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:01.160
Hey.

2
00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:02.720
Hey.

3
00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.500
Zhang Liang, you two go find a safe place.

4
00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:07.620
I'm going after him.

5
00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:08.940
Hi.

6
00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:11.140
A long time to see people.

7
00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.880
Or is Zhang Liang a good friend of mine, and he obviously wants me to die knowing that an assassin doesn't dare kill you, what the hell does he know?

8
00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:17.520
It's not that he was threatened.

9
00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.100
When the Yunhai project is over, I won't play with him anymore.

10
00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:22.240
Mr. Yang, why did you stop my brother?

11
00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.640
Is that what my brother said?

12
00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:26.500
How can I hire a killer?

13
00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.480
I used my job to ask for help.

14
00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.080
You're talking about Truong Dung, right?

15
00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:33.100
General Director Shen just told me that he will help you solve this problem.

16
00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:39.000
There's no blood.

17
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.820
The murderer didn't run, still here, slave.

18
00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.460
Change the position of the cat and mouse

19
00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.140
Let s see where you run.

20
00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:10.640
Is it your turn?
