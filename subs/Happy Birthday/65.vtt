1
00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.640
Which assassin is coming from the Great Wall?

2
00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:05.120
Shra, this can't be a joke.

3
00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:06.500
Are you kidding?

4
00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:08.100
We think we know.

5
00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:10.140
Hey.

6
00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.360
Shra, if you look at my phone...

7
00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:15.060
This brother can't do it.

8
00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:16.440
You wanted to kill me.

9
00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.020
I dare to be your brother.

10
00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:19.000
Wow.

11
00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:21.820
What, I fuck you.

12
00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:28.080
It's done.

13
00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.280
The American way of standing firm on the other side is waiting to lose money.

14
00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:34.040
The behind-the-scenes boss of Ta Ngoc Long Huong Zen Group

15
00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.620
Even my sister can't get in touch.

16
00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:39.860
You have his contact information.

17
00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.180
What's your deal with him?

18
00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:43.800
What's halfway?

19
00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.240
Do I know about Zhang Liang's brother?

20
00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:50.700
So I asked people to come to Ta Van Long to negotiate compensation.

21
00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:53.740
Zhang Liang wants to sell shares of the company

22
00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.220
I don't want to see my brothers suffer.

23
00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.640
Shen Ra, are you wrong?

24
00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.300
You have been talking to us for so many years, brother, how could he kill you?

25
00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:05.820
We found it.
