1
00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:07.460
Everything as you see it.

2
00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:09.680
I want to transfer my shares.

3
00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:11.860
Your brother's story is your brother's.

4
00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:13.740
It has nothing to do with you.

5
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:15.560
Waiting for us to finish the Sea of Clouds project together.

6
00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:17.980
You can make up for the loss of your brother.

7
00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:19.260
You know that.

8
00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:21.040
Vice President Chen told you that, didn't he?

9
00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:22.480
What does this have to do with silence?

10
00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.220
My brother's story is also what Deputy General Director Chen told me, without him.

11
00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.900
I didn't know my brother was in such trouble.

12
00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.860
After my parents died, my brother kept me.

13
00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:33.340
This time he was in trouble.

14
00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.600
Even if I do my best to help him.

15
00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.060
You can help him.

16
00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.080
But not at all.

17
00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:40.900
Now I know about this.

18
00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:42.740
I absolutely can't ignore it.

19
00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:44.580
After this is over.

20
00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.020
You took me to see your brother.

21
00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:48.280
Shen Lang

22
00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:50.440
I really don t see the wrong person.

23
00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.540
This brother of yours, I have determined.

24
00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.220
Missing

25
00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.580
They're both not angry.

26
00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:19.700
What's going on?

27
00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:22.260
Isn't he bound?
