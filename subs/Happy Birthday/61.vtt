00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.140
Hey buddy, I can't believe you still like this tune.

2
00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:04.680
He's a killer.

3
00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:06.580
Except for the assassins.

4
00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:09.260
That's too bad.

5
00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:16.120
Looking so beautiful to be an assassin is not even as obedient as coming to serve me.

6
00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:18.000
I absolutely can't be without you.

7
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.080
I can t believe that your taste is so unique.

8
00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.480
Master, it's me.

9
00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:24.720
Just one characteristic.

10
00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.040
Likes you and is beautiful.

11
00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:27.840
Hey.

12
00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:32.100
Just because you want to talk to the Shen brothers?

13
00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:33.800
Give me your dog's hand, knock.

14
00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.360
Or I'll kill him first.

15
00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:36.740
And then kill you.

16
00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.420
Hum does not self-assess

17
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.800
What?

18
00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.620
Didn't you tell me to take good care of you?

19
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.740
Just good service again.

20
00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.220
Give me the keys.

21
00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:51.560
Or I'll kill them.

22
00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:52.380
Let go!

23
00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:54.220
Give him the keys.

24
00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:55.600
I give up this mission.

25
00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.880
Let me go, don't be impatient, brother, give him the keys.

26
00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:01.780
I don't want to die.

27
00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.080
I can't keep it for you

28
00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.820
Give me the keys.
