1
00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.980
Chen Lang, you get drunk quickly.

2
00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:17.320
You drink first.

3
00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:18.280
I'm going out for a minute.

4
00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:19.080
Sister Quan.

5
00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:20.820
Wait a minute.

6
00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.060
Whose is this?

7
00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.220
Why are you wearing this mask?

8
00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:35.160
Who gave it to you?

9
00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.600
Just sent it outside.

10
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.620
When we danced on the dance floor

11
00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:42.980
Everybody stand up.

12
00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:46.380
Stand up.

13
00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.140
It's delicious, strong.

14
00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.740
Tran Phu's house is always so beautiful.

15
00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:02.360
You're still hungry.

16
00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:03.880
You know what?

17
00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:06.220
Don't the flowers smell like wildflowers?

18
00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:08.600
Without this woman to follow me.

19
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.620
Lao Tzu needed to find wild and stealthy food.

20
00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.400
Then you.

21
00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.200
No, these people have long hair.

22
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.800
The clown wears a hat.

23
00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.140
But also short hair.

24
00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.980
And the shoes under the feet of the little hands are sneakers.

25
00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:27.220
Right.
