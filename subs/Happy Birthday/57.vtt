All right.

We make pens.

19
00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:42.420
People are expensive, how much is it?

20
00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.500
Haha, I'll teach you.

27
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.040
There's only two of us in this room.

28
00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.860
I hope this doesn't go to a third party.

29
00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:15.100
