00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:10.580
Why are you two together?

2
00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:12.600
The Lord wants to kill you.

3
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.140
Are you kidding?

4
00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:15.240
Bruce is telling the truth.

5
00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:16.720
There's actually a killer with a male gun.

6
00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:18.780
If we don't run fast, we'll get hurt.

7
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.540
Right.

8
00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:22.500
Wanted to kill.

9
00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:26.300
Come on, I'll take you for a walk.

10
00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:39.940
We finally got rid of this killer.

11
00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:41.440
Where are we going now?

12
00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:44.900
Just go home, have a bodyguard to keep me safe.

13
00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.420
After tonight, everything will be safe.

14
00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:54.700
Drive.

15
00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.860
I only know A amount for an hour so that he goes further and further.

16
00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.540
Hello, I'm not sure if his target is only me.
