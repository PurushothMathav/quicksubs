00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:02.720
Stop fighting.

2
00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:03.980
I sent it to you a long time ago.

3
00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:06.120
No matter how you fight, it's useless.

4
00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.460
Tell that guy, I'll let you go.

5
00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:10.120
Director Shen, what's going on?

6
00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:11.440
Isn't this the guy at the bar?

7
00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:12.400
Why is he here?

8
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:13.640
He's a killer.

9
00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:15.260
Sent to kill me.

10
00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:16.260
Kill the killer

11
00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:19.940
How could such a beautiful girl be an assassin?

12
00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.180
This one.

13
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:25.800
This one.

14
00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.500
That's a killer.

15
00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.020
You can get this.

16
00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:31.760
Looks like a killer.

17
00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:34.740
I remember you giving him the card.

18
00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.820
Would you force something like that to sleep next to you?

19
00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.300
I didn't know he was an assassin, if I knew he was an assassin, give me 800 livers, I wouldn't dare.

20
00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.400
Who told you to come here and kill my brother?

21
00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:46.600
You're the opposite.

22
00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:47.480
What are you doing here?

23
00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.360
Can you tell me you didn't tell me to kill him?

24
00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:51.560
If I kill him.

25
00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:55.180
His stake is yours. What the hell are you talking about?

26
00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:59.400
I don't know him.

27
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:05.200
No, if I didn't know him, how would I know that our agreement was that he would tell me?

28
00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.880
He promised me if I killed him.

29
00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.620
Give me five million dollars when it's done.

30
00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.340
The $1 million on my bank card is a security deposit he prepaid.

31
00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:21.540
There's actually a transfer.

32
00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:22.660
The time was yesterday.
