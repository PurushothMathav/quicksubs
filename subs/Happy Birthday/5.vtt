00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:02.600
Ah.

2
00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:04.940
Fuck!

3
00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:06.800
Shen, what's wrong with you?

4
00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:08.780
What did you dream about that made you so angry?

5
00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:13.240
I told you you were drunk, you woke up fast, but you didn't drink very well.

6
00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:14.580
Pour two cups and pour.

7
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.300
Ha ha ha

8
00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:19.500
"Drink first, I'll go out for a while."

9
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.920
The killer always comes to kill me when no one is there.

10
00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.480
But if I don't go with Tran Tinh...

11
00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.420
He can't do it.

12
00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.420
Nobody's going out this door today.

13
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.020
I'll change cars.

14
00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.500
I told you no one's going out this door today.

15
00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:39.720
General Director Shen, I have prepared a gift for you.

16
00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:40.700
Right outside.

17
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:41.940
Birthday cake?

18
00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.180
I know, thank you for your kindness.

19
00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:46.880
Not you. How do you know?

20
00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:51.100
When you sent me the report today, did you see that it is my birthday today?

21
00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:54.520
It's your birthday.

22
00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:59.180
I said how mysterious is Deputy General Director Chen today ha ha ha ha

23
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.380
It was the Shen brothers' birthday.

24
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.780
Everyone together to toast happy birthday to the Shen Lang brothers.
