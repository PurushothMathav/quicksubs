00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:03.040
General Director Shen

2
00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:05.060
Your ability to drink is not good.

3
00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:06.920
Why drink two drinks and fall down?

4
00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:07.880
You drink first.

5
00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:09.140
I'll go out first.

6
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.660
When I came home, there was only Zhang Liao apart from the three of us.

7
00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:17.660
hic

8
00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.520
General manager, your ceiling is so beautiful.

9
00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:24.140
You're hungry and you don't have a choice.

10
00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.180
And his phone call.

11
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:29.760
You obviously know I'm home.

12
00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.380
Why pretend not to know?

13
00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:33.540
He's going to tell the killer.

14
00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.580
According to the Van Hai project, the previous profit was several hundred million.

15
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.200
The future is even more envious.

16
00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:41.700
So the killer who killed you today is most likely your competitor.

17
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.260
It can also be your partner.

18
00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:45.860
You're right.

19
00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.420
The killer can also be with you.

20
00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.300
Happy Birthday to General Director Shen

21
00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.920
Shen Lang is your birthday today.

22
00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.580
You said how mysterious Vice President Chen is today ha ha

23
00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.040
Mr. Shen Lang's birthday

24
00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:01.840
Then we have to drink more.

25
00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:07.100
First of all, let's toast to Mr. Shen Lang, happy birthday, happy birthday.

26
00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:10.140
Zoe, you let me out.
