00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:02.120
Lead the gang! Lead the gang!

2
00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:05.650
sorry. He doesn't get married.

3
00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:07.330
He's not in good spirits.

4
00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:10.110
Is getting married related to poor mental health?

5
00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.700
Amazingly good people will not get married.

6
00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:15.500
Is this mission related to towels?

7
00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:18.000
Then I must be crazy. You can't understand me.

8
00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.880
Crazy? Why should I be considerate?

9
00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:22.180
Where is the manager? Where is the manager? Where is the manager?

10
00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:24.120
Little boss! Little boss! Little boss!

11
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:25.700
Little boss, you said it was upstairs,

12
00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:28.240
Dear guest, why is there another explosion here?

13
00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:31.140
You two go outside and wait.

14
00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.140
But this matter cannot be left alone.

15
00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.280
Yes, yes, Boss Xiao

16
00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:36.850
Even better

17
00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:38.020
Boss Xiao apologizes

18
00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:40.210
Apologizing is useless

19
00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:42.250
what do you want to do

20
00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:44.080
Throw the towel, right?

21
00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:46.000
You have your own skills, right?

22
00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:47.900
Let them both finish the water

23
00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:49.060
Come talk to me again

24
00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:50.530
Okay, you check

25
00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:51.800
you you you

26
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.150
Give Boss Xiao 12, hurry up

27
00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:55.310
This director is really bad
