1
00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:01.060
Half a million.

2
00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:03.980
What a mad dog.

3
00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:05.680
Fifty thousand was recovered.

4
00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:08.280
This kind of orange diamond ring can only cost up to 100,000 yuan.

5
00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.710
Such a generous purchase price for a car,

6
00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.670
Maybe it has something to do with the Shaan family.

7
00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:14.160
It turned out to be Mr. Zhao.

8
00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.210
Mr. Zhao also came here to cause trouble. It must be here,

9
00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:20.560
Linjiang Manufacturing Industry is really generous in its approach.

10
00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:24.820
A divorce, saying that they didn't hook up in private,

11
00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:26.140
Even I can't.

12
00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.410
Listen to this, these two companies may cooperate.

13
00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:31.320
Five hundred thousand can be negotiated with Linjiang Prefecture.

14
00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.240
And he can also please Xiao Jianshan

15
00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:35.210
I heard that the Xiao family is behind this

16
00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:36.520
And the Jiang family’s support

17
00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:40.630
Five hundred thousand dollars can help you get involved with the Jiang family.

18
00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:43.800
I think there is a case except Mr. Zhao

19
00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:45.720
No one is participating in the compensation competition, right?

20
00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:47.300
Five hundred thousand once

21
00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:49.120
vote for this

22
00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:49.840
Five hundred thousand twice

23
00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:50.740
No one competes with the Xiao family

24
00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:54.170
Five hundred thousand three times

25
00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.640
Five hundred thousand and one hundred

26
00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:05.459
This lady is fifty thousand and one hundred and it’s you again

27
00:01:05.459 --> 00:01:08.380
510,000

28
00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.870
Five hundred and one thousand and one hundred you

29
00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:12.510
What's going on?

30
00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:13.740
This is better

31
00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:18.280
You're looking for trouble. Six hundred, six hundred and one hundred thousand.

32
00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.800
600,010 sold

33
00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.000
This diamond ring

34
00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.040
Belong to this one

35
00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:31.480
lady in white dress

36
00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:34.560
A total of six hundred thousand and one hundred

37
00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.930
Supports cash and check transactions

38
00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.160
You still have to pay
