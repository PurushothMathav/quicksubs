00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.940
Director Lin, are you satisfied?

2
00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:06.380
She is very smart, and she is worthy of being the wife chosen by Jiang Min.

3
00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:08.960
Master Sun, the formalities are half over.

4
00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:11.090
No, he can handle it on his own.

5
00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:12.550
No need for us to take action.

6
00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:15.120
You took the risk to come here for this Mrs. Sun,

7
00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:16.780
I didn't understand it at first.

8
00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:18.840
Now, I understand.

9
00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:19.460
Understand what?

10
00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:21.780
This Mrs. Sun, I don’t know how many ghost masters there are.

11
00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:23.380
He also has a good heart.

12
00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.960
He has a good heart when he can help others vent their anger.

13
00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:28.550
What's even more rare is that he can control the entire situation,

14
00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.640
And did not take advantage of the identity of Mrs. Sun of the Jiang family.

15
00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:36.160
Waiting to be happy.

16
00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:40.740
Why is this kid acting like this all of a sudden?

17
00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:41.630
Don't know

18
00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.820
Who bullied us just now? It was her

19
00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:46.900
It was her idea, your manager

20
00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:48.900
Your employees just wanted to teach us a lesson

21
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.060
slapped my man

22
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:52.160
How do you calculate this?

23
00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:55.150
What do you think we should do?

24
00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:58.000
Just what should I do, Xiao Qian?

25
00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.220
She just hit you

26
00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:00.110
You can't fight now

27
00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:04.879
Then you two will protect the mountain with your hands.

28
00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:06.410
until satisfied

29
00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.030
If you are not satisfied, please don’t pick us. We don’t have peaches.

30
00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:11.380
who do you think you are

31
00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:13.160
Why do you want to delete it if you ask it to be deleted?

32
00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:28.360
How dare you ask the ghost to let you go?

33
00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.380
Please let me go
