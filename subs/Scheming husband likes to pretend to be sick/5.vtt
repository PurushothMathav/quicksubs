00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:03.890
Mrs. Sun, did you know that in the past six months, the Jiang family has

2
00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:05.710
Why did you marry six times?

3
00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:11.920
Half of them were asked to leave because our young master Sun doesn't like them.

4
00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:15.160
Half of it is because he offended a few of us.

5
00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:16.780
I can't stand the bullying

6
00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:17.920
Walked by myself

7
00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:21.720
No wonder I heard

8
00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.340
When someone leaves the Jiang family

9
00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:24.060
Crazy crazy ding ding

10
00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:28.030
It's your handiwork. You guys left this person for you.

11
00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:31.630
You don't dare. We are just a few scary people. How can we do this?

12
00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:34.180
But if Mrs. Sun doesnâ€™t want to be in the Jiang family?

13
00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:36.080
Stepping on nails while walking

14
00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:38.240
Biting a glass bag while eating

15
00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:39.620
When sleeping in the middle of the night

16
00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:42.240
If a mouse crawls onto the bed,

17
00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:44.520
You have to be polite to the three of us.

18
00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:48.140
Come and drink this cup of obedient tea

19
00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.890
Mrs. Sun has such a beautiful face

20
00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:54.170
If it's because of disobedience

21
00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.090
I was bitten by mice accidentally.

22
00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:06.620
That would be such a shame, Dad and Mom

23
00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.240
Just chat, just chat

24
00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:09.820
You also record

25
00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:11.940
You are so despicable and despicable

26
00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:13.220
I want you to be despicable

27
00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:16.060
None of you in the Jiang family have the courage for a single moment.

28
00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:17.600
How can I not be despicable?

29
00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.040
Don't call it a mouse then

30
00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.710
It's like running around like a mosquito

31
00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:22.790
I'm pretty good at pitching

32
00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:24.510
You really have no rules and get angry

33
00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:29.200
Shut him down for me and change the scene to stop.
