00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.660
I would like to invite you. What do you think you are?

2
00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:08.680
That is, with Boss Xiao here, how can I make you smile?

3
00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.120
What group of properties does this hotel belong to?

4
00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:16.079
Isn’t this asking without knowing why?

5
00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.840
Who wouldn’t let this be the property of our boss Xiao, Xiao Jianshan, and the Xiao Group?

6
00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:22.400
What do you think makes this kind of person angry?

7
00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:24.740
He was so ignorant that he didn't even know who he was.

8
00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:25.660
I don’t know how he died!

9
00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:29.120
Just be from the Xiao Group. I have a document here,

10
00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:31.230
I want to talk to you alone.

11
00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:33.590
Will I show it to you alone?

12
00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:36.420
I'd rather take a look

13
00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:37.810
What documents did he take out?

14
00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:39.130
Can you save the dog's life?

15
00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:47.930
Shaw Group

16
00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:49.430
Economic documents submitted to Xiao Group

17
00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:51.130
I've told you why you have it

18
00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:52.430
It is Xiao Group and

19
00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:54.110
Cooperation documents of Xiao Group

20
00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:55.070
that must be

21
00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:56.050
senior management

22
00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:56.890
can only be seen

23
00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:58.780
who are you

24
00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:00.890
Tell me, I am Mrs. Sun of the Jiang family

25
00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.860
He definitely doesn't believe it

26
00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:03.320
Will he defeat Jiang Mingran?

27
00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:04.420
There are handfuls

28
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.080
haven't you heard

29
00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.140
The company wants to parachute a management policy

30
00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:10.740
are you

31
00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:17.220
It's Manager Lin from the new store in the Human Resources Department. That's right. I was right.

32
00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.560
Are you really the manager of the new store of the Vanishing Group?

33
00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.730
Why are you dressed like a waiter?

34
00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:27.310
And I heard that Manager Lin is a man. It seems

35
00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:30.510
The company's confidentiality work is done well, yes yes

36
00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:32.380
Not even my gender was revealed.

37
00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.980
So more aggressive

38
00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.240
Because of the company

39
00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:36.540
Appeared recently

40
00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.100
Some officials are corrupt

41
00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.320
Destroyed company and people’s livelihood

42
00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.980
Companies that are short-circuiting public funds

43
00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.300
That’s why I deliberately lurked like this

44
00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:46.260
Come here to investigate yes yes yes

45
00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.160
Mr. Yao, you did a good job.

46
00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:51.100
Manager Lin, please listen to my explanation.

47
00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:52.250
That's not what happened
