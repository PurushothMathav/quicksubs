00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.320
Village chief! Stop!

2
00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:06.590
Have you forgotten where this is?

3
00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:08.620
Master Sun is resting upstairs.

4
00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:10.410
Mrs. Sun doesn't understand the rules.

5
00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:11.640
That’s it for you.

6
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:12.540
Don’t you understand either?

7
00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:14.880
The old man was blaming them on the surface.

8
00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:16.280
Actually scolding me.

9
00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:19.120
Butler Feng was the one who caused trouble first.

10
00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:20.940
Who is he? No rules.

11
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:22.400
It's Mrs. Sun.

12
00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:25.070
He said there were not many good people in the Jiang family.

13
00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:27.580
Some of us can't listen anymore.

14
00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.200
I just had an argument with him.

15
00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:30.180
That's it.

16
00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.800
Mrs. Sun, have you ever said this?

17
00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:34.560
I said it.

18
00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.220
Butler Feng, I really didn’t lie.

19
00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:41.660
He really said it

20
00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:42.880
as scary

21
00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:44.140
No matter what Chuzi said

22
00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.020
It's your turn to talk nonsense around.

23
00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.970
Mrs. Sun

24
00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:51.610
Are you satisfied, okay? But

25
00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:53.820
How to do this? Don’t worry.

26
00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:56.120
Today the Jiang family mansion

27
00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.220
If a fly flies in

28
00:00:58.470 --> 00:00:59.670
Even on my head

29
00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:02.120
Did you hear it? Did you hear this cup of tea?

30
00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:03.710
Drink it yourselves

31
00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:05.480
Do you want me to do it for you?

32
00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:10.100
Hurry up

33
00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:11.760
Clean the Jiang family mansion

34
00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.720
If half a bug flies in tonight

35
00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:16.370
I'll let you swallow it

36
00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.540
Hurry up and get separated from the housekeeper

37
00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.230
When did you become so polite to me?

38
00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:26.110
Mrs. Sun is joking

39
00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:27.440
as a servant

40
00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:29.960
You should respect your master

41
00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:32.600
Miss Third, please come to me.

42
00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:34.400
What's the matter

43
00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:35.300
She said she was sick

44
00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:36.900
want to show you

45
00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:42.850
I've sorted out my clothes. Thank you.
