00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:05.820
Cheers, cheers,

2
00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:09.280
How grand was the auction held by Mr. Consumers?

3
00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:10.260
Well, please come in

4
00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:19.450
Hey, Jiang Ming, what's going on here?

5
00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:20.570
What else are you preparing?

6
00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:25.610
Hello, Jiang Ming, you actually drew my phone number?

7
00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.140
Why is this young lady even holding hands?

8
00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.690
Whose sister is this, so beautiful?

9
00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:44.710
I donâ€™t know, it seems quite thoughtful,

10
00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:46.450
Which family is this guy from?

11
00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:48.080
What's the best way to call it?

12
00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:50.250
Is there such a thing?

13
00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:55.220
Maybe I saw it wrong

14
00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:12.720
What are you thinking about?

15
00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:16.240
How did you put Mao Guzi down with this eldest sister?

16
00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.580
Although you are so angry

17
00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:22.380
But there is no need to call yourself an orphan.

18
00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.460
Who do you think is the eldest sister?

19
00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:26.020
The orphan Mao I'm talking about is you

20
00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.080
Who is this person?

21
00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.420
Why are the roads so rough?

22
00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.320
talking to a little girl

23
00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:35.220
The way you came is not bad, but I think you are ruthless

24
00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:39.560
Everyone, ice carvings

25
00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:41.380
Her mother will tell her to start

26
00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:44.200
Please take a seat.
