00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:03.110
Where are you going to eat?

2
00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:05.090
No, I didn't eat anything.

3
00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:07.190
It's not bad, come back quickly.

4
00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:10.070
When the old man comes back tonight, everyone is waiting to give him a clean slate.

5
00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.230
Got it, got it, go back now.

6
00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:15.120
Especially the way you did it.

7
00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:16.440
I know.

8
00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:18.780
That piece of money is useless. If you don’t pay, the matter will never end.

9
00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:20.620
Why does it look like you are breaking into a house?

10
00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:22.950
No matter what, I want something delicious anyway.

11
00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:26.640
Hurry up and I'll tell you, if you don't give me the money, you won't be able to leave alive today.

12
00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:30.590
Boss, I didn’t bring any money today.

13
00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:32.130
Why are you going to my things without any money?

14
00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:34.390
Is this delicious?

15
00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:36.450
You are messing with you, right boss?

16
00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:37.290
You have to be reasonable

17
00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:38.570
I asked you how you sold it

18
00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:39.630
You said twenty yuan a pound?

19
00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:40.410
You signed it

20
00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:41.410
Then he said twenty yuan a tael

21
00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:43.430
Then how can I sign it for you, boss?

22
00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:47.860
This thief's tricks are worse than mine. What are you doing?

23
00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:50.300
Do I force him to eat or buy it?

24
00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:52.110
He eats my food without paying me

25
00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:53.670
He also dealt with his boss

26
00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:54.370
Otherwise

27
00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:55.790
Then let me go back first

28
00:00:58.380 --> 00:00:58.840
I'll ask someone to send you money and come back.

29
00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:00.220
Send someone to give me money

30
00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:04.060
You can also buy me and my ointment.

31
00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:06.200
Then you can come home with me and be a chef.

32
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.000
I think I might as well give you some color

33
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.140
It seems you don’t even know your memory

34
00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.580
Isn't it just money?

35
00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:13.400
I gave it to him
