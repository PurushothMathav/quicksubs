00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:03.560
Okay, that’s it for today’s lesson.

2
00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:06.980
Hey, teacher, when can I inherit the Jiang family's property?

3
00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:09.210
Good question.

4
00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:13.090
Take the current status quo and your average level of governance into consideration.

5
00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:15.530
I suggest you change your learning goals.

6
00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:20.500
Ah, is he scolding me, but I can't understand.

7
00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:26.060
Oops, I didn’t let him attend class today. Are you trying to slander me?

8
00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:27.770
I almost got led away by your nose.

9
00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:31.560
If you are not a cow, why should I lead you by the nose?

10
00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:32.940
So what exactly is going on?

11
00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.300
Actually, I don't have a good impression of Jiang Mian either.

12
00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.130
If you want me to help you, you can

13
00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:40.080
But how much help do you want from me?

14
00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.000
You'll have to pay the same revenge

15
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.780
I can help you keep an eye on Jiang Mian

16
00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:46.820
But you have to answer me a question first

17
00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:49.460
Ours is Jiang Jiang and Xiao Jiang

18
00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:51.080
you want revenge

19
00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.800
Why is Xiao Jianshan of Xiao Group

20
00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.690
I think I've heard of it

21
00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:01.030
Zhilinjiang Province has recently climbed up the ranks.

22
00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.770
But there is no way to compare with our Jiang family.

23
00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:06.050
not them

24
00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:09.610
How could he know Xiao Jianshan?
