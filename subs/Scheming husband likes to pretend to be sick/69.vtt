00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:01.780
Hey, don't do it

2
00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:03.180
It was you who made the move first

3
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:04.660
Who told you to say that?

4
00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:07.080
Stop fighting

5
00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:08.180
I'm warning you

6
00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:09.760
My face is very tender

7
00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:10.880
I'm warning you too

8
00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:11.920
I don’t have two hairs left

9
00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:13.700
I can't hold on anymore. I won't let go.

10
00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:14.880
If you want to loosen up, loosen up first

11
00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.540
If you don’t let go, neither will I.

12
00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.120
I said three two one

13
00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:18.920
Let's relax together

14
00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:21.560
Ah three two one

15
00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:26.790
You are quite rich, you are serious

16
00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:27.630
You're such a joke

17
00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:28.730
How dare you owe me face

18
00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:30.010
Why do I owe you face?

19
00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:31.890
You marry our Jiang Jiang

20
00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.490
It's just for weddings

21
00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:34.350
you to me

22
00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:36.270
But it's not right to go to peace and happiness

23
00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:41.980
You are not even as good as peace and happiness, you dog

24
00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:43.540
Who will marry you Jiang Jiang now?

25
00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:44.600
look at you

26
00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:45.800
I feel out of breath after walking for two steps.

27
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.160
I feel thirsty after taking off two pieces of clothing

28
00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:50.080
No one can pick you harder than you

29
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.390
I don't know what to say

30
00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:54.910
If you hadn't had some bad money

31
00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:55.690
who do you want

32
00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:00.640
Divorce must be divorced, just divorce

33
00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:01.920
who will marry you now

34
00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.060
Look at your half-dead state

35
00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.000
I think you need to get the divorce certificate soon

36
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.140
Or death certificate is faster?

37
00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:22.320
Parents are busy

38
00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.310
Just because of greed for money

39
00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.700
You marry into our Jiang family

40
00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.120
Isn’t it just the little money from our Jiang family?

41
00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:32.010
What's different
