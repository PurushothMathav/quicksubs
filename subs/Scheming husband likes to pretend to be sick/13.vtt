00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:09.600
There are quite a few people offended. Why do you want him to die?

2
00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:12.660
Forget it, just for the sake of seeing that you have a pretty good figure.

3
00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:14.220
Let me help you again.

4
00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.660
It seems that Mrs. Sun is a good person this time.

5
00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:41.150
If you were a really good person, you wouldn't collect cards and checks.

6
00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:45.240
It's a bit greedy for money, but who says people who are greedy for money can't be good people.

7
00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.280
Whether it's good or not is another matter, but it should be usable.

8
00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:54.840
Everyone knows a hundred lots, but I know them.

9
00:00:59.100 --> 00:00:59.860
Who do you think is a ghost?

10
00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:06.910
What a pervert again.

11
00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:08.370
I think you look like a pervert.

12
00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:10.450
Why are you here?

13
00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:12.690
This is my home, my house,

14
00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:14.400
My bed, why can't I be here?

15
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.940
Then you sleep on the bed, where should I sleep?

16
00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:17.960
Oops, I don't care

17
00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.320
It’s rare to be able to sleep without pretending to be sick

18
00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:21.600
I want to sleep enough at once

19
00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:23.640
Are you afraid that someone will harm you?

20
00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:25.600
So I keep pretending to be sick and showing weakness.

21
00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.260
Make others think you have only a few days to live

22
00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.900
I can give you a break, okay?

23
00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:30.930
Then do you know who wants to harm you?

24
00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:32.030
I know

25
00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:33.140
do you want to know

26
00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.030
Look at the pile of things in your hand

27
00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:36.330
Don’t you know who it is?

28
00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:39.550
You are quite a traitor

29
00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:40.310
Let me ask you a question

30
00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:41.980
Is your grandfather

31
00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:43.120
The richest man in Lin Jiang

32
00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:44.020
Who is he looking for?

33
00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:45.080
You have so many questions

34
00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:47.150
Otherwise, let me ask you something

35
00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:48.560
Okay, okay, you ask

36
00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.840
It seems like we are today

37
00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:53.640
wedding day

38
00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:03.960
How did you meet Xiao Jianshan?

39
00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:07.190
How do you know Xiao Jianshan?

40
00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:14.560
Xiao Jianshan is the culprit behind the bankruptcy of your Shen family, right? No, no, who is that?

41
00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.710
Xiao Jianshan is my father’s partner

42
00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:18.970
He coaxed my dad into using me a few months ago

43
00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:21.740
Invest all the company's funds into a project

44
00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:23.340
Later my family went bankrupt

45
00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:24.380
My parents are in jail

46
00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.470
I can only be sold to your Jiang family

47
00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:27.880
Become a granddaughter-in-law and resist the war

48
00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.510
Xiao Jianshan does these things

49
00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:31.380
The Jiang family is behind this

50
00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:33.340
Xiao Jianshan is a idiot

51
00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.900
Otherwise we wouldn't have been interested in him in the first place

52
00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:37.820
My parents didn’t know about it until they were taken away.

53
00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:39.630
The project I invested in a few months ago

54
00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:41.150
They belong to your Jiang family

55
00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:42.400
So from the beginning

56
00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:43.420
You are just a yellow

57
00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:44.260
Don't recognize you as ours

58
00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:46.410
This matter has nothing to do with us, but

59
00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:47.750
I probably already know

60
00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.440
Who instigated Xiao Jianshan?

61
00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:51.700
I can't tell you now

62
00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:52.540
Wait until I find out

63
00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:55.080
That time

64
00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:57.660
What do you give in exchange?

65
00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:59.260
what do you want to do
