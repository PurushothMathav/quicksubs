00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:02.230
Let Jiang Mian die.

2
00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:03.960
Which of you is harmful to others?

3
00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:05.940
Miss Shen, you misunderstood.

4
00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.790
My nephew, since his parents died in a car accident,

5
00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:10.910
I have been in poor health.

6
00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:14.830
I want you to take good care of him until he dies.

7
00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:18.490
Jiang Mian usually comes into contact with relatively few people.

8
00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:21.170
There are also dedicated people taking care of food and clothing.

9
00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:24.070
Even those of us are hard to get close to.

10
00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:28.710
I think only you, the new lady, can join the front line.

11
00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:31.720
My nephew has suffered a lot since he was a child.

12
00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.680
If only you were there to serve me

13
00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:35.520
The aura that makes him disease-free and pain-free

14
00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.580
It's also a blessing for him

15
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.560
Do you understand what I said?

16
00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:41.510
It turned out that he wanted to borrow a knife to kill someone.

17
00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:43.390
That's it

18
00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:45.410
I understand. Bring it.

19
00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.860
What are you getting? Medicine?

20
00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:51.370
At this time

21
00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:53.710
Shouldn't you just come up with some colorless and odorless medicine?

22
00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:55.930
Do you want me to add it to what Jiang Ming eats?

23
00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:57.500
we are not prepared

24
00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:00.650
If outsiders find out that we bought these things

25
00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:02.960
But we can't escape the relationship.

26
00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:04.739
Ask me to take medicine again

27
00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:05.680
Let me buy medicine again

28
00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:10.100
Just give me this little money to make things difficult for you.

29
00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:11.080
What did Jiang Mian say?

30
00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:12.020
Also my husband

31
00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:16.500
In this regard

32
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.380
Wait until I inherit the Jiang family's property

33
00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:19.330
at that time

34
00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.870
Hey, this, this, this

35
00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:21.760
Stop painting cakes. I wonâ€™t listen.

36
00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:23.110
How dare you be sure

37
00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:24.150
Jiang Mian is gone

38
00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.450
Jiang family's family business

39
00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:27.980
It will definitely fall on your head.

40
00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:31.100
The richest man, Mr. Jiang, is in good health, right? Also

41
00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:33.260
The Jiang family also has a second uncle, right?

42
00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.080
He cannot inherit it

43
00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:36.900
So I just said

44
00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.400
For career planning

45
00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.880
None of you are big enough

46
00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:41.580
Not systematic enough

47
00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:43.120
Let me analyze you

48
00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:44.800
Things like robbing family property

49
00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:46.470
It's actually a technology

50
00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:48.470
First you have to do this

51
00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.430
Is there something wrong with you?

52
00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:00.690
Would you like to switch to your morning run as normal?

53
00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:02.090
Why did he let it go?

54
00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:03.850
Teach others how to increase production
