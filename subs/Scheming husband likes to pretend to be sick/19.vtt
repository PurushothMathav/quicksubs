00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:03.050
So you think I have this document

2
00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:05.510
What is your status in the Xiao Group?

3
00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:08.960
This project is one of the most important projects for our group in the future.

4
00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:10.760
How about having access to this file?

5
00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:13.200
That is of course the core core of the group.

6
00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:17.160
So what is your current position in the group?

7
00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:18.460
I'm still a group leader

8
00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:21.980
How amazing. He turned out to be a team leader.

9
00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:25.140
If I tell your uncle what happened today

10
00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:25.840
Mr. Xiaoâ€™s words

11
00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:28.580
Supervisor, you must not say that.

12
00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:33.330
Mr. Xiao and I are just distant relatives who cannot be further apart.

13
00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:34.920
This is exactly the same surname

14
00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:37.070
Everyone thinks she and I are family and

15
00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:38.730
I feel like Xiao and I are always a family

16
00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:40.340
It's very respectable, so that's why

17
00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:45.710
It turns out you were just faking it. My tiger is.

18
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.020
It turns out you were faking it too

19
00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:48.190
Both of us are fine

20
00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:49.840
Did someone just say

21
00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.040
Scarred Waiter's Clothes

22
00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:55.000
He also forced me to drink the blood, Manager Lin.

23
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.260
Sir, you don't care about others' mistakes.

24
00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:57.400
Are you kidding me?

25
00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.000
Then he hit my friend with that scar

26
00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:01.850
How can he be considered Manager Lin?

27
00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:04.019
I apologize to you. Look

28
00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.040
Hey hey hey hey hey

29
00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:07.380
Then are you satisfied with this?

30
00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.100
You must not send it to the mountain

31
00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:15.890
Are you fans all standing? Lin Zhuluo

32
00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:16.610
I apologize to you

33
00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:17.660
What are you looking at?

34
00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:18.680
kneel down

35
00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.080
Kneel down, kneel down, Lin Zhuluo

36
00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:22.940
Are you satisfied?
