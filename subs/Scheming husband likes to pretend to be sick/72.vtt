1
00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:07.060
On the day of the old man’s birthday party

2
00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:08.660
Just take this wine

3
00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:11.490
Give it to the woman named Shen and ask her to give it to Jiang Mian.

4
00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:14.920
Even if the woman didn't spike the wine

5
00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:16.710
As long as everyone sees it

6
00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.170
Jiang Mian had the accident after drinking the wine she gave him.

7
00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.110
She was charged with murdering her husband.

8
00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:26.710
But don't worry

9
00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:29.640
I have been waiting for this day for more than twenty years

10
00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:30.340
After tomorrow

11
00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:33.790
The Jiang family belongs to us, mother and son.

12
00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:34.880
You still have Facebook

13
00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:36.780
If not more than twenty years ago

14
00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.940
You took my medicine to do that kind of thing

15
00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.230
Do I need to play dumb here until today?

16
00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:44.590
Mom, it’s been so long

17
00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:45.650
You even took it out and said it

18
00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:47.990
So what did I know when I was a teenager?

19
00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:49.830
I thought that if I killed Dajun and his family, everything would be over.

20
00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:52.540
How did I know someone came back to our picture?

21
00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:57.530
If not, no one would think of it

22
00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:59.770
It's when a teenager goes blind

23
00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.050
No matter how much money I spend to help you hide it, it’s useless

24
00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:07.660
Then haven’t I endured this for more than twenty years?

25
00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:10.330
If I weren't afraid that others would find our pictures

26
00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:12.310
Many generals were killed

27
00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:16.260
I wrongly thought that he was so ill that he had only a few days to live.

28
00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.690
Who would have known that something would happen the day after he graduated?

29
00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:23.390
There's no point in being alarmed

30
00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:24.760
Waited for tomorrow

31
00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:26.250
He drank and died

32
00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:27.400
His wife was arrested

33
00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:32.470
It's us, mother and son, who have the final say

34
00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:36.090
My hometown is me

35
00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.300
No one can take it away
