Isn't it just money? I gave it to her.

2
00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:03.420
You give it to her.

3
00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:06.920
How much does she pay for the higher amount? I'll pay it back for her. five hundred?

4
00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:08.360
I'm five hundred.

5
00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:09.700
A dollar is as high as five hundred dollars.

6
00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:11.420
I don’t understand bullying other little girls.

7
00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:13.460
Her black-hearted boss is too outrageous.

8
00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.149
It's so high, so expensive.

9
00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:18.540
How expensive is it? I sell this fragrance all the time.

10
00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:19.980
It’s hard to sell for a high price.

11
00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:21.200
Sometimes you need to find your own reasons.

12
00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:22.440
The company has not grown over the years.

13
00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:25.910
Stop, stop talking, hurry up.

14
00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:29.150
That's pretty much it.

15
00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:31.040
Little girl, little girl.

16
00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.880
Uncle, it's okay. Just give it to me.

17
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.320
I want to ask if I can have another piece

18
00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:39.280
Eat another piece

19
00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:44.450
Then I'm going to keep you as a mortgage boss.

20
00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:48.940
You see, I gave you so much money

21
00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:52.640
Can you give me another piece of bank?

22
00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:54.480
Look, you little girl is quite sensible.

23
00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:55.980
Give you another piece

24
00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:56.950
Just one piece

25
00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:05.150
Then I'll cut it and give it to you, boss.

26
00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:06.970
