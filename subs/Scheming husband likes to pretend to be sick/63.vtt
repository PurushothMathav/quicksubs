00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:05.740
Huh? What?

2
00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:08.260
Is it expensive? I can’t drink it?

3
00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:11.510
No. Either of you can drink.

4
00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:16.110
I just came here to investigate and apologize. elder sister,

5
00:00:16.329 --> 00:00:19.430
What are you going to do? Who are you?

6
00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:29.920
Well, come on. I must beat you in this one.

7
00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:32.689
It's late at night, what are you doing when you come to your door and call yourself?

8
00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.620
You said, he didn’t just scare me to death by stuffing his teacup into it, right?

9
00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.230
Won't. I don't think he has the guts.

10
00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:45.050
Granddaughter-in-law, give it another try,

11
00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:47.550
I can definitely beat you with this one. Come.

12
00:00:58.390 --> 00:00:58.830
Oh, oh, oh, hurry, hurry, hurry

13
00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:01.500
It's too late now

14
00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:02.500
There are many things to do tomorrow

15
00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:03.300
need you to handle

16
00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:06.570
Let's go back and have a rest. Which one?

17
00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.880
Let's play again, sir

18
00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.840
You don't need to rest yourself

19
00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.760
You have to consider whether Master Sun and the others have taken a break.

20
00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:24.860
I hope this old store of mine can leave behind its old ways and go back.

21
00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:26.160
Let's go back to the house

22
00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:28.880
You two, you two, are doing your business.

23
00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:31.160
Grandpa, walk slowly

24
00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:32.240
Goodbye grandpa

25
00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:42.180
Good night grandpa, it’s so hot
