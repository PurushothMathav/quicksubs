1
00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:01.980
Who are you from the Jiang family? How?

2
00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:04.280
It doesn't matter, so I can't buy it?

3
00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:06.540
Will I attend your auction?

4
00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:07.840
Do you want a DNA test?

5
00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:14.070
I have memorized information about the Jiang family, but without this, is there a conflict?

6
00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:17.630
Mr. Xiao, how can there be someone like him in the Jiang family?

7
00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.980
I think he is just here to shine and deceive.

8
00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:23.120
The card in his hand is most likely fake.

9
00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:24.720
I advise you to find out.

10
00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:27.880
OK, then go check it out.

11
00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:31.300
If it's fake, I'll stab you in the mouth.

12
00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:33.520
What if it's true?

13
00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:37.020
If it's true

14
00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:41.240
I kneel down and call you aunt, okay?

15
00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:43.140
Then I will take care of you, my good granddaughter.

16
00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:46.670
this lady

17
00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:48.070
I don't remember inviting you

18
00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:49.210
Attend tonight's auction

19
00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:53.290
Could you please give me this invitation card?

20
00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:54.990
No invitation card

21
00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:56.990
How dare you say you are not a liar?

22
00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:58.420
Who says I don't have it

23
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:05.940
This is not a bus card, Mr. Sheng

24
00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:07.700
This person is just here to cause trouble.

25
00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:09.250
I suggest you find someone

26
00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:10.630
Tear his mouth off for me

27
00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:13.180
Mr. Xiao, let us take care of him.

28
00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:18.280
what are you doing

29
00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:23.280
Mr. Xiao, what is this card for real?
