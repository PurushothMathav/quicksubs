00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:03.280
Ah ah

2
00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:04.910
Ah ah ah ah

3
00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:08.440
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah

4
00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:12.030
Are you saying that you have been trying to harm me behind my back this New Year?

5
00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.500
It's my second kiss. I guess so.

6
00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:17.800
Otherwise, he will tell you all the news about your accidents over the years

7
00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.300
What is your first time at the end of life?

8
00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:26.640
It reminds me every day of how many times you almost succeeded in killing me. What did your cousin put in there?

9
00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.060
It's okay, it's not like you don't know

10
00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:35.920
If something happens to you and your family member is taken away, who will be there?

11
00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.560
Where are you going? This is looking for grandpa.

12
00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.280
The handle will be in the gray gray gray gray gray gray gray gray gray gray gray gray gray gray gray gray gray gray gray gray gray gray gray grey.

13
00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:41.410
Let everyone see

14
00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:42.530
Cap reduction in that game

15
00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:43.970
What do you say about looking at the sea?

16
00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:45.070
Just that little bit of evidence

17
00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:46.330
I can't move him

18
00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:47.430
If he insists

19
00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:48.610
Talk about those hat reductions

20
00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:49.990
It's just that he cares about things

21
00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:50.990
Want to find out what's behind it

22
00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:52.170
Is there anyone you want to kill?

23
00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:54.700
We also blame him for not saying anything.

24
00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:56.780
That's his thing

25
00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:58.520
I had guessed it a long time ago

26
00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:00.060
Monitor others for questioning

27
00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:01.810
Wait until we reduce the cap

28
00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:02.950
It should have been dealt with long ago

29
00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:07.520
As long as you know

30
00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:08.930
No matter what happens in the future

31
00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.730
Never worry about reading

32
00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:11.670
we are husband and wife

33
00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:12.830
Fight together if something happens

34
00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:13.630
Do you know?

35
00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:22.170
In broad daylight

36
00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:24.010
You need to rely on your husband

37
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:26.700
I've thought of a way, maybe

38
00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.100
Show them obediently

39
00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.780
What can be done

40
00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:31.670
Let's get a divorce, right?
