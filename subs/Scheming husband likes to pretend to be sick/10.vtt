00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:00.900
Not them.

2
00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:04.560
Mr. Shen, this is the project I found first.

3
00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:07.210
As long as we invest the existing funds of the group.

4
00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.390
It doesn't take three months to solve the company's existing funding problems.

5
00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:12.830
Wouldn't it be too risky to do this?

6
00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:16.160
There are risks, but there is no place more effective than this.

7
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:30.520
I swear on my character that it's done.

8
00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:32.659
Thank you Boss Jiang for the opportunity.

9
00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:41.340
Since there's nothing else, I'll leave first. etc.

10
00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:44.700
Miss Shui, what about Jiang Mian?

11
00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:47.420
Jiang Mian is the young master Sun of the Jiang family.

12
00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.700
If you want the heir of the Jiang family to survive, you have to pay the same amount.

13
00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:52.780
That half a million.

14
00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:56.960
That five hundred thousand is not a meeting gift you gave to my granddaughter-in-law who just passed away.

15
00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:59.680
Could it be that I understood it wrong?

16
00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:02.780
That's right, Miss Sun, that little money will be used as a meeting gift.

17
00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.440
There is still room for us to help each other in the future

18
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.780
You don’t want to be with a sick man for the rest of your life, right?

19
00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:12.300
Who knows? Before I finish what I want to do

20
00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:14.010
I will never leave the Jiang family

21
00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:17.900
Thank you also for capturing me to repay Jiang Ming’s debt.

22
00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:21.540
By the way, don’t call me Miss Sun from now on.

23
00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.900
Call me Mrs. Jiang or Mrs. Sun from the Jiang family
