00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.210
Have you ever paid for someone’s dinner and couldn’t even get enough to eat?

2
00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:04.820
Just grab something to eat.

3
00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:09.440
It is also the richest family.

4
00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:11.440
It is even richer than others.

5
00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:13.440
Did you hear that?

6
00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:17.910
The guard said that Master Sun was back with Mrs. Sun who had just walked in.

7
00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:19.000
Still holding hands?

8
00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:20.080
Real or fake?

9
00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:21.530
Is it still possible to have a lie?

10
00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:23.750
Mrs. Sun just went out yesterday.

11
00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.690
It didn't take long.

12
00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:27.390
Young Master Sun became so angry that he went to the host house to follow him.

13
00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:30.360
Master Sun, how long has it been since he went out?

14
00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:31.500
That is to say,

15
00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:32.280
If it were before,

16
00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:35.060
After marrying into the house, she was kicked out within three days.

17
00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:37.210
Now they are in the same place and in the same place

18
00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:39.730
Are you really seeing the right person? That's nonsense.

19
00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.810
How could Master Sun like him?

20
00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:43.210
What about a lowlife like him?

21
00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:44.130
Look at him

22
00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:46.150
In addition to eating every day, I am making trouble

23
00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.330
Like a hungry firstborn

24
00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:50.060
Of course, no one was wrong

25
00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:55.190
Mrs. Sun

26
00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:56.690
If you are hungry

27
00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:57.450
you can order us

28
00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:58.870
I’ll prepare a midnight snack for you.

29
00:00:58.870 --> 00:00:59.690
No need, no need

30
00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:01.630
A low-class person like me

31
00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:03.070
It’s better to eat poisonous food

32
00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:04.910
They all said he was a lower class person.

33
00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:06.540
No rules

34
00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.210
I just got slapped last time

35
00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.150
Butler Feng is not here

36
00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:14.160
Let's see who will save her this time

37
00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:15.660
Last time I got slapped

38
00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:16.980
I have to get it back
