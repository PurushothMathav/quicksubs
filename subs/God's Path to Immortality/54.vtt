00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:01.366
kid

2
00:00:01.366 --> 00:00:04.133
How can you catch my dragon gripper?

3
00:00:04.133 --> 00:00:05.666
No way. It's impossible.

4
00:00:05.666 --> 00:00:08.433
It is rumored that the flying dragon grappling hand of Yingxianmen moves quickly

5
00:00:08.466 --> 00:00:10.200
Hundreds of moves can be made in a second

6
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.800
99 of them are false

7
00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:13.000
Only one move is fatal

8
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.200
10 strokes can be accepted without being biased or moving

9
00:00:16.666 --> 00:00:18.800
Hasn't his inner space recovered yet?

10
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.266
Why so tyrannical

11
00:00:20.266 --> 00:00:21.100
Not a waiter

12
00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:23.466
Why did you deliberately steal the old man's kung fu?

13
00:00:23.466 --> 00:00:25.166
Didn't you just demonstrate this yourself?

14
00:00:25.166 --> 00:00:27.700
I don't know what tricks this handsome guy has

15
00:00:27.733 --> 00:00:29.000
Chiyang Zhenren's moves

16
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.200
It's impossible for him to see

17
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:32.500
Such a complex move

18
00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.500
How can you learn it after reading it once?

19
00:00:34.966 --> 00:00:37.366
My master and I have been learning for more than ten years and have been mixed for two successful years

20
00:00:37.366 --> 00:00:38.366
You can see it at a glance

21
00:00:38.366 --> 00:00:39.533
You take me for a fool.

22
00:00:39.533 --> 00:00:40.366
Ozawa

23
00:00:40.533 --> 00:00:43.266
Don't you have original kung fu in Tianyuanmen?

24
00:00:43.333 --> 00:00:46.200
Cut tricks oops

25
00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:51.900
Brother, hold on!

26
00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:54.166
It will be fine soon.

27
00:00:57.366 --> 00:00:59.300
Clients steal my moves

28
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.433
Impossible to lose to you thief

29
00:01:01.566 --> 00:01:03.533
Dragon Ball can not only absorb Xuanmen Dao

30
00:01:03.533 --> 00:01:05.300
Even moves can be completely compounded

31
00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:06.366
It's such a confrontation

32
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:07.933
A tie at most

33
00:01:07.933 --> 00:01:09.566
No, we must win
