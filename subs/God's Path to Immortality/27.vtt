Not 1,000% take

5
00:00:17.933 --> 00:00:20.266
Not good, this palm is so domineering

6
00:00:20.333 --> 00:00:22.566

It is to cut off the potential of the celestial body

13
00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:35.700
The master actually killed

14
00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.400
Junior sister, are you alright?

00:00:39.566 --> 00:00:41.500
I'm afraid I can't melt by forcing my hand

17
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.733
Why not do the opposite for the benefit of all?

If successful, you can advance your cultivation

26
00:00:58.466 --> 00:00:59.566
If it fails

27
00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.400
It will vanish.

28
00:01:03.166 --> 00:01:04.366
