00:00:01.933 --> 00:00:02.733
This

2
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.900
He was able to interact with virtual illusions.

3
00:00:06.333 --> 00:00:07.833
Obviously there is no true fate in the body

4
00:00:08.666 --> 00:00:09.633
Could it be that

5
00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:15.000
you

6
00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:16.500
you

7
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.000
It's over. It's over. He was eaten by beads.

8
00:00:20.866 --> 00:00:21.900
little brother

9
00:00:23.166 --> 00:00:24.133
How come?

10
00:00:24.133 --> 00:00:25.833
I can feel his pain

11
00:00:25.866 --> 00:00:27.966
The resentment Shen Nuo just collected

12
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:29.900
Should be enough to suppress distractions

13
00:00:30.666 --> 00:00:32.533
Damn it's alright

14
00:00:32.533 --> 00:00:34.066
Must be just luck

15
00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.400
This kid was actually able to enter the virtual illusion just now

16
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.266
It seems that the visitor is not good

17
00:00:41.533 --> 00:00:43.100
Xian Yong hold on

18
00:00:48.866 --> 00:00:49.666
Ah!

19
00:00:55.733 --> 00:00:59.033
This child's extraordinary skills are generally no longer foundation building

20
00:00:59.566 --> 00:01:01.100
I'm afraid it's already above the big city

21
00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:02.433
How is that possible?

22
00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:03.366
That's not possible.

23
00:01:03.933 --> 00:01:06.033
There must be something wrong with the illusion itself

24
00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:08.566
The pain went away.

25
00:01:08.566 --> 00:01:10.066
He really broke the illusion

26
00:01:10.766 --> 00:01:11.600
fairy

27
00:01:13.166 --> 00:01:14.633
I saw you were unwell just now.

28
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.000
Is it better now?

29
00:01:17.966 --> 00:01:21.000
I'm fine, this fairy friend is amazing

30
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.466
I don't know who Xianyou is

31
00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.833
Sure enough, it is a white flexible green tea, who wouldn't?

32
00:01:27.933 --> 00:01:30.300
Little brother, are you all right?

33
00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:32.700
It's okay, who said it's okay?

34
00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:34.966
Ah, it's a spiritual cockroach

35
00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:39.866
Hmph, it's so easy to get a virtual illusion

36
00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.200
I'm afraid it's a monster
