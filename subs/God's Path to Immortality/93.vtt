00:00:01.366 --> 00:00:04.200
Isn't this bead sealed to understand soul tribulation?

2
00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:05.966
But the beads are broken.

3
00:00:05.966 --> 00:00:08.400
When Elder Ling Nian broke the bead

4
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.633
I thought the soul that keeps out the cold would dissipate at any time

5
00:00:13.666 --> 00:00:15.066
But the beads are still warm

6
00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:17.566
So I concluded that the soul that kept out the cold had not left

7
00:00:17.566 --> 00:00:18.700
That is to say

8
00:00:18.866 --> 00:00:20.466
Sister still has the possibility of resurrection

9
00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.100
Yeah, you could say that.

10
00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:24.833
Too bad I can't see it. Your hand is hurt.

11
00:00:25.933 --> 00:00:27.666
Be careful he's coming back to life

12
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.366
Is this an immortal cockroach?

13
00:00:32.266 --> 00:00:33.166
He died.

14
00:00:34.066 --> 00:00:34.900
not good

15
00:00:38.333 --> 00:00:40.233
Here is yo

16
00:00:40.366 --> 00:00:41.700
It's the two of you

17
00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:45.666
When the old ancestor is about to take off and ascend to immortality

18
00:00:45.666 --> 00:00:47.000
I can still meet you

19
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.600
Fate, fate, you are still alive

20
00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:51.300
Cause and effect in the world

21
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:52.833
All originated on that day

22
00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.266
The old man has sought the god of cause and effect

23
00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.800
Give you a chance to sleep in time

24
00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.133
Boy, you still need to go back and solve this evil fate yourself

25
00:01:01.133 --> 00:01:02.900
Go to evil
