00:00:01.266 --> 00:00:02.133
Not bad. Not bad.

2
00:00:02.133 --> 00:00:05.633
This time, you can be considered to have completely eradicated the grass and roots

3
00:00:05.766 --> 00:00:07.500
It's time to send you back

4
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.100
Keep out the cold

5
00:00:09.533 --> 00:00:11.600
Can Senior Sister go back too?

6
00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:13.766
You have changed the course of the world

7
00:00:13.766 --> 00:00:16.300
No casualties except for the devil himself

8
00:00:16.366 --> 00:00:18.166
But Ancestor changed the past

9
00:00:18.166 --> 00:00:19.900
Doesn't it change the cause and effect later?

10
00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:21.466
The world has its own destiny

11
00:00:21.466 --> 00:00:22.766
Everything that should come will come

12
00:00:22.766 --> 00:00:25.000
People who should know will know

13
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.600
You don't have to worry about that.

14
00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.466
It's a pity that after I awakened the strength of my body

15
00:00:30.866 --> 00:00:32.333
Life expectancy is less than three days

16
00:00:32.333 --> 00:00:34.166
And then what happened?

17
00:00:34.866 --> 00:00:36.000
I don't think so.

18
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:36.866
fool

19
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.633
You forgot about cutting your finger

20
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.066
Is this

21
00:00:41.066 --> 00:00:43.666
At that time, half of my soul was still sealed in that bead

22
00:00:43.766 --> 00:00:45.133
Although I can't communicate with you

23
00:00:45.133 --> 00:00:46.200
But I was conscious.

24
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.333
You forgot that I was born with phoenix blood

25
00:00:48.333 --> 00:00:50.066
Can purify any strange poison in the world

26
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.366
Then say so boy

27
00:00:52.366 --> 00:00:53.500
so

28
00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.200
Did you get a big bargain?

29
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.133
I tried my best to cut your finger

30
00:00:57.133 --> 00:00:59.033
Just to cleanse your loneliness

31
00:01:00.266 --> 00:01:02.133
Go ahead. Why thank me?

32
00:01:02.133 --> 00:01:05.000
Then I will accompany you for the rest of my life, hahahaha.

33
00:01:05.133 --> 00:01:07.700
The old man is no longer a light bulb here

34
00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.600
If you are destined to be in the immortal class

35
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.200
Remember to treat the old man to a jar of good wine

36
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.600
Hahahaha

37
00:01:15.166 --> 00:01:16.300
Yingfeng brother

38
00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:20.300
Hey big brother

39
00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.466
This kid is up again

40
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.366
Why did you wake up again?

41
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.066
It's you two again
