00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Hello baby

2
00:00:02.166 --> 00:00:04.300
Demon Lord, return my sister's life

3
00:00:04.666 --> 00:00:05.800
Yuchen retreats first

4
00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:06.766
You can't beat him

5
00:00:06.766 --> 00:00:07.966
Dead people are too powerful

6
00:00:07.966 --> 00:00:09.366
I'm afraid you can't do it alone.

7
00:00:10.066 --> 00:00:12.266
It doesn't matter if I have my own measure.

8
00:00:12.666 --> 00:00:14.766
Is trading peak

9
00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:16.966
How about I make a deal with you?

10
00:00:16.966 --> 00:00:17.833
What deal?

11
00:00:18.466 --> 00:00:21.266
My daughter loves you like crazy

12
00:00:21.266 --> 00:00:23.566
You hand over the bones

13
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.333
Killed the woman next to you at your own expense

14
00:00:27.333 --> 00:00:28.700
I will spare your life

15
00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:31.266
Let the flies go with you

16
00:00:31.266 --> 00:00:32.200
Pardon me?

17
00:00:32.666 --> 00:00:34.233
You still call yourself a dignified devil

18
00:00:34.366 --> 00:00:36.233
How dare you say such a thing?

19
00:00:36.933 --> 00:00:39.533
Do you think you still have a choice?

20
00:00:39.533 --> 00:00:42.366
You have to use all your strength to save him

21
00:00:42.366 --> 00:00:44.666
To get rid of the bone worms in his body

22
00:00:44.666 --> 00:00:48.166
If you don't save him, you may not be my opponent

23
00:00:48.333 --> 00:00:50.766
You think I have nothing but life

24
00:00:50.766 --> 00:00:51.800
Have nothing?

25
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.533
Hmph, don't I know you yet?

26
00:00:54.533 --> 00:00:58.066
Shao Yifeng 400 years ago, even if you tried your best

27
00:00:58.066 --> 00:00:59.866
Still no business

28
00:00:59.866 --> 00:01:02.866
You haven't forgotten the tragic situation back then, have you?

29
00:01:03.533 --> 00:01:06.200
This item is Yinglong Dragon Ball.

30
00:01:06.266 --> 00:01:08.100
It purifies everything.

31
00:01:08.266 --> 00:01:10.233
I thought it was something good

32
00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:13.100
Hahaha, take a closer look at that dragon ball.

33
00:01:13.566 --> 00:01:16.166
The whole bead is dull

34
00:01:16.166 --> 00:01:18.966
You must have overused it before

35
00:01:19.066 --> 00:01:22.600
If you use the Dragon Ball again, you will have all your mana

36
00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.133
It has become an ordinary bead.

37
00:01:25.133 --> 00:01:26.400
Good stuff

38
00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.066
Of course, it will be saved for the right time.

39
00:01:29.733 --> 00:01:31.666
Ying Long God of War gave me this bead

40
00:01:31.666 --> 00:01:33.966
Presumably for this moment
