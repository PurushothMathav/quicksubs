1
00:00:01.566 --> 00:00:03.500
Your cultivation is exhausted

2
00:00:03.866 --> 00:00:05.700
You are the pinnacle of the world

3
00:00:05.933 --> 00:00:06.966
So and so

4
00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:08.733
You still have to self-destruct

5
00:00:08.733 --> 00:00:10.166
Enhance the power of divine suffering

6
00:00:10.533 --> 00:00:12.366
I can live for revenge

7
00:00:12.766 --> 00:00:14.566
Can also die for revenge

8
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:15.566
What do you mean?

9
00:00:15.666 --> 00:00:17.000
Why did you die?

10
00:00:17.866 --> 00:00:20.433
Once the power of the bones reaches the peak

11
00:00:20.533 --> 00:00:22.433
Destroy the earth unimaginable

12
00:00:22.466 --> 00:00:24.366
Toxicity will also increase to the maximum

13
00:00:24.366 --> 00:00:26.200
If all awaken and become stock gods

14
00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.500
In your mortal body you have only three days to live

15
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.600
Not for three days.

16
00:00:30.666 --> 00:00:32.466
Peak I don't want you to die

17
00:00:32.466 --> 00:00:34.433
If I don't become a true stock god

18
00:00:35.466 --> 00:00:37.200
I can't avenge Shenyunzong

19
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.500
Can't avenge my elders

20
00:00:39.666 --> 00:00:41.200
He will be killed by your father

21
00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:44.900
From now on

22
00:00:45.266 --> 00:00:47.566
Xiao Yingfeng is the master of the entire Shadow Forest

23
00:00:48.066 --> 00:00:49.500
Master of the Shadow Grove

24
00:00:51.066 --> 00:00:51.866
minister

25
00:00:52.266 --> 00:00:54.166
Willing to follow the god of stocks

26
00:00:54.533 --> 00:00:55.700
Saddle before and after

27
00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:57.166
Until death

28
00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:00.100
Follow the god of stocks until death

29

Follow the god of stocks until death
