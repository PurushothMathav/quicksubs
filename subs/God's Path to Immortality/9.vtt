00:00:03.066 --> 00:00:04.000
Uh-huh.

2
00:00:13.933 --> 00:00:14.966
I'm going to hit you

3
00:00:18.066 --> 00:00:20.666
It's really wonderful to face your burning ice and fire

4
00:00:20.666 --> 00:00:22.200
Then you say

5
00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.300
I trapped him in Xuantian with ice and fire

6
00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:30.300
The fire is endless, worry-free ice cave

7
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.000
His words and deeds will make his life worse than death

8
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.766
Hahahahahaha

9
00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:42.300
Hahaha

10
00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:53.500
Ah!

11
00:00:54.866 --> 00:00:55.733
How is that possible?

12
00:00:55.733 --> 00:00:56.900
The formation is broken

13
00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:58.366
Just to exercise power

14
00:00:58.666 --> 00:01:00.033
Injured this kid's title

15
00:01:00.066 --> 00:01:01.700
This child is a demon

16
00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:03.200
It's my turn

17
00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.566
Hey.

18
00:01:05.366 --> 00:01:06.666
The elders themselves go into battle

19
00:01:06.666 --> 00:01:07.800
He will definitely die

20
00:01:08.333 --> 00:01:10.166
Chief, please help him

21
00:01:10.166 --> 00:01:11.666
Please, Yun Nian

22
00:01:11.666 --> 00:01:13.400
You use the jade to transform the realm of the gods

23
00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.233
He is a mortal

24
00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:16.700
How can I damage your majesty?

25
00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:18.966
Why are you so busy?

26
00:01:19.133 --> 00:01:20.600
Can I bully a child?

27
00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.266
Well, elders can use their power as much as possible

28
00:01:23.666 --> 00:01:24.466
With all due respect

29
00:01:24.466 --> 00:01:26.966
This is trash.

30
00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.333
Don't be brave, little brother

31
00:01:29.333 --> 00:01:30.466
Beg for mercy

32
00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.133
Young people are so clear and stupid

33
00:01:33.133 --> 00:01:35.166
Elders like to bully Beckham

34
00:01:35.166 --> 00:01:38.700
Today I will fulfill it, you pick me up

35
00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.066
Next year, he actually made ten victories

36
00:01:43.266 --> 00:01:44.633
This kid rests
