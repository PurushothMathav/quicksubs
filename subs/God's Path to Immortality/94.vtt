00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.000
Peak, come and chat with dad

2
00:00:07.933 --> 00:00:08.733
screen

3
00:00:09.166 --> 00:00:11.366
Screen screen

4
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.233
What are you thinking, child?

5
00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:17.700
Dad

6
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:19.000
Is that really you?

7
00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.433
Of course, Ancestor didn't lie to me.

8
00:00:23.166 --> 00:00:24.466
I'm really back

9
00:00:24.466 --> 00:00:26.633
What is this kid talking about?

10
00:00:27.166 --> 00:00:28.200
Married to keep out the cold

11
00:00:28.533 --> 00:00:30.233
Are you confused?

12
00:00:33.566 --> 00:00:34.600
Why are you here?

13
00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:35.433
how

14
00:00:35.533 --> 00:00:38.600
Shouldn't I come to see your son's wedding?

15
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.500
So today I'm going to kill the grass and roots

16
00:00:41.966 --> 00:00:43.533
You can't turn over if you have something to do.

17
00:00:43.533 --> 00:00:46.033
You fool is as crazy as your father

18
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.266
Since I'm here today

19
00:00:48.266 --> 00:00:49.900
Just come prepared

20
00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.966
Tread the mountain Yunzong, I am bound to win

21
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.500
You are no match for him

22
00:00:55.566 --> 00:00:57.100
Let Dad deal with him for five days

23
00:00:57.933 --> 00:01:00.066
This time, change the child to protect you Yi Feng

24
00:01:00.133 --> 00:01:02.233
I won't leave you alone this time

25
00:01:02.533 --> 00:01:04.533
I've thought about keeping out the cold

26
00:01:04.533 --> 00:01:06.566
No matter if you call me Jiang Bailian or Yu Han

27
00:01:06.666 --> 00:01:07.666
I am happy

28
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.200
Are you really keeping out the cold?

29
00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.033
I am the reincarnation of Jiang Bailian

30
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.766
After reincarnation, a birthmark sealed my meridians

31
00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.100
You cannot learn Taoism

32
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.800
But I still met you in the dark

33
00:01:20.566 --> 00:01:22.500
What are you talking about?

34
00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.600
My child has a lot to say to you.

35
00:01:24.966 --> 00:01:26.200
When he is solved

36
00:01:26.333 --> 00:01:27.666
I'll tell you slowly

37
00:01:27.766 --> 00:01:29.966
Losers die
