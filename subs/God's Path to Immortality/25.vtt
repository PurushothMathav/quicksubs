00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:01.200
Game 1

2
00:00:06.866 --> 00:00:08.266
It's alright, right?

3
00:00:10.533 --> 00:00:12.366
Master, are you really thin?

4
00:00:12.366 --> 00:00:14.166
It seems that he is immortal for that kid

5
00:00:14.166 --> 00:00:15.333
It's not the small side that's wrong.

6
00:00:15.333 --> 00:00:16.466
It's him Jiang Bailian

7
00:00:16.466 --> 00:00:19.900
Are you proud that the stinky thing asked him to take the blame for you?

8
00:00:20.733 --> 00:00:23.600
What words did I voluntarily receive the punishment for Senior Sister?

9
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.633
Junior brother, the mere speaker can't hurt me, Xiao Yingfang

10
00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:30.300
Junior sister hum, some of this senior sister is good to you

11
00:00:30.366 --> 00:00:31.533
Why should you like him?

12
00:00:31.533 --> 00:00:32.866
Who said I like him?

13
00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:33.800
You let me go

14
00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.766
Brother, don't be brave

15
00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.166
I said how can this kid still stand up?

16
00:00:38.166 --> 00:00:40.033
It turned out that the master was merciful.

17
00:00:40.066 --> 00:00:41.733
Oh, show me some mercy.

18
00:00:41.733 --> 00:00:43.966
The master privately despises violating the rules

19
00:00:43.966 --> 00:00:45.133
Let's just leave it at that.

20
00:00:45.133 --> 00:00:45.933
Junior Sister

21
00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:47.866
You are not related to him

22
00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:48.733
What's the hurry?

23
00:00:48.733 --> 00:00:50.500
Take the second palm

24
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.700
What are you doing? Pay attention to your image.

25
00:00:53.933 --> 00:00:54.600
Pay attention to what?

26
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:55.600
Pay attention to the image

27
00:01:00.133 --> 00:01:01.366
Do you want to fight?

28
00:01:01.366 --> 00:01:02.533
What's the hurry?

29
00:01:02.533 --> 00:01:04.033
slow work

30
00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.266
Say it.

31
00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:08.633
Lao Mao, you said that the three nectar poles refine hardware

32
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.766
I can absorb the power of others for my use

33
00:01:10.766 --> 00:01:12.766
Refining the seventh step can offset all damage

34
00:01:12.766 --> 00:01:15.033
The eighth step of refining the big palm cultivation base

35
00:01:15.066 --> 00:01:16.333
Throw it away and don't look at it.

36
00:01:16.333 --> 00:01:18.533
No one can practice the orchid cheats to the eighth step

37
00:01:18.533 --> 00:01:19.500
There is no record

38
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:20.366
No Bajie

39
00:01:20.366 --> 00:01:21.733
Then I'm going to create my own Bajie

40
00:01:21.733 --> 00:01:23.000
The sea is open to all rivers for my use

41
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.600
Wouldn't that be a breakthrough in the seventh step of the Orchid Cheats?
