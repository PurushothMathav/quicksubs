00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:01.400
This devil is immortal

2
00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:02.800
Killing like a cockroach

3
00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:07.266
I'm sorry, it's all to save me Dragon Ball

4
00:00:07.466 --> 00:00:08.533
That was my decision.

5
00:00:08.533 --> 00:00:09.600
Don't blame yourself.

6
00:00:09.933 --> 00:00:12.300
In response to the wind

7
00:00:12.533 --> 00:00:15.400
I admit that your strength was the strongest at the time

8
00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:16.700
You can beat me.

9
00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:19.233
But it can never destroy me, can it?

10
00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.866
I don't know if Lord Demon Lord is the strongest second time

11
00:00:21.866 --> 00:00:23.433
Is there any misunderstanding?

12
00:00:23.566 --> 00:00:25.500
Say what is the so-called strongest

13
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.100
That is to destroy everything in the world

14
00:00:27.266 --> 00:00:28.733
Even if you are immortal

15
00:00:28.733 --> 00:00:30.700
I can also make you ashes

16
00:00:30.966 --> 00:00:33.166
Hello, Zhao Yunfeng

17
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.033
You finally used the power of your bones

18
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.633
I offer his cultivation method

19
00:00:39.166 --> 00:00:40.400
Ah!

20
00:00:41.566 --> 00:00:43.000
Uh-huh.

21
00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.866
The name of the valley is super

22
00:00:49.166 --> 00:00:50.633
This will show you

23
00:00:50.933 --> 00:00:52.066
What is the strongest

24
00:00:52.066 --> 00:00:54.100
God, is this the power of the ancient gods?

25
00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:55.800
Too strong yeah

26
00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.033
But not

27
00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:58.133
What do you mean?

28
00:00:58.133 --> 00:00:59.666
Every morning seems the same

29
00:01:00.066 --> 00:01:02.800
But each dynasty uses a different move

30
00:01:04.066 --> 00:01:05.266
Don't be so

31
00:01:05.266 --> 00:01:07.100
I would also like to thank the Lord of the National Army for his advice along the way

32
00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:08.700
If it weren't for the blood feud

33
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.166
Such a powerful force

34
00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.433
To say that he is not dead

35
00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.900
I give him a stick of incense, and he will come back to life again

36
00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.633
No, he won't this time.
