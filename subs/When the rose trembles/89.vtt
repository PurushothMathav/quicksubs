00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:01.960
I'm so sure I can't contact her.

2
00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:05.080
There will be a day when you can't contact her.

3
00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:07.870
Give me her preferences.

4
00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:11.540
You don't care if I want her cell phone.

5
00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:14.280
Don't you know that we are not familiar with each other? You must know.

6
00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:17.360
She won't fail to tell you. How could it be?

7
00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.480
I care so much about plastic with her. She is comparable to you and her.

8
00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.060
Right, Mr. Zhou. this,

9
00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:26.890
Just give me her cell phone.

10
00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:37.800
I didn’t even ask for it. I don't. Don't say I didn't.

11
00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.950
Even if I had it, I wouldn't give it to you.

12
00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:43.280
Unexpectedly, you are also shocked.

13
00:00:43.280 --> 00:01:06.740
When you get home, your family has turned upside down and you can’t even do it.

14
00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:15.440
Did something happen at home?

15
00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:32.870
We are about to reach my branch city

16
00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:35.290
I'll send you a message

17
00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:42.380
It doesn’t matter if I say it

18
00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.580
I want you to come back and tell mom

19
00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:49.260
Guess how late I will be back
