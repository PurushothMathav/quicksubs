00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:12.580
I bought a vase with thorns on each flower,

2
00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:15.100
How could you let Madam do such a dangerous thing?

3
00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.800
You take out the cards inside and the rest,

4
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.570
Ah, I was right,

5
00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:24.440
What do you want for dinner?

6
00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:30.770
What are you usually doing? Then I'll think about it first.

7
00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:39.420
Fried chicken, fried skewers, fusilli noodles, barbecue, pull-up sets, and hot pot are all available.

8
00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.100
You wonâ€™t mind the taste, right? If the lady doesn't like it,

9
00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:48.750
Love to eat that money

10
00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:51.300
We are too willing to eat it, right?

11
00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.710
Do you still have this money?

12
00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:01.780
The hair is so professional

13
00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.600
Mr. Xie, otherwise

14
00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:33.520
Let's not let my face catch me.
