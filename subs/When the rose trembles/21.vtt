00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:08.600
Well, you went to get married yesterday,

2
00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:10.460
There is no need to give you molecular money.

3
00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:13.140
After all, the two of us have been together for so many years.

4
00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:18.160
Even if it starts. If you give money to a member, you have to attend the wedding.

5
00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:21.860
You will not be unprepared for the marriage ceremony. No.

6
00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:25.280
That counts. If you are not old, your grave will be ruined.

7
00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:29.200
Heart to all this. Shooting.

8
00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:34.530
Brother Zong, he is,

9
00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:37.040
What's wrong? Don't be straight. He has resigned.

10
00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.800
Why? He said he was going to get married.

11
00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:47.930
Huh? Are you kidding me?

12
00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:51.000
Who is he married to? You are not married yet?

13
00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:54.080
Just because I heard

14
00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:56.050
The first song will talk about foreign girls, right?

15
00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:58.290
Well, you don’t think it’s possible either

16
00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:59.980
Of course it's impossible

17
00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:03.090
she said so

18
00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:05.800
It can't be because of you and that boy Xu Xuze

19
00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.590
It's not her, it's a blockage

20
00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:12.810
She had an argument with that employee today

21
00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.250
But she has never been like this before

22
00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:20.180
Love is about talking for a while

23
00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:26.230
Zong Ning's business is behind the children.

24
00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:58.860
Will I harm you?
