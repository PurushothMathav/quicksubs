00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:04.040
When Bile is enjoying all this,

2
00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:07.310
Neither dare confirm my eyes,

3
00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:09.420
I didn't dare to say, "Let me not follow you."

4
00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:12.380
Now they are accusing me of recruiting you first,

5
00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:14.940
Just one day,

6
00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:20.690
Getting on the bus is not scary, the scary thing is,

7
00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:23.370
He surrendered and got out of the car wiping his hands.

8
00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:40.040
Then he walked away again, reluctant to leave, so he just got off the car.

9
00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:47.330
This car is right

10
00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:49.500
How many days did you stay with him?

11
00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.180
They always take the family with them and sit on the plane

12
00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:56.260
What happened to your friend?

13
00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.300
It's easy for them to take advantage of you

14
00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.100
My stomach is clear even when I go out on the street.

15
00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:01.600
Belly is clear

16
00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:18.770
Itâ€™s you who are born, born, born, born, born, born, born, born, born, born, born, born, born, born, born, born, born, born, born

17
00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:43.020
Life, life, life, life, life, life, life, life, life, life, life, life, life, life, life, life, life, life, life, life, life, life, life, life, life, life, life.

18
00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:53.420
Life, life, life, life, life, life, life, life, life, life, life, life, life, life, life, life, life, life, life, life, life, life, life, life, life, life, life.

19
00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.420
Life, life, life, life, life, life, life, life, life, life, life, life, life, life, life, life, life, life, life, life, life, life, life, life, life, life, life.

20
00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.470
Life, life, life, life, life, life, life, life, life, life, life, life, life, life, life, life, life, life, life, life, life, life, life, life, life, life, life, life, life, life, life, life, life, life, life, life, life, life, life, life.

21
00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:16.660
I'm tired, I'm tired, I'm tired, I'm tired, I'm tired, I'm tired

22
00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.220
You signed the cooperation yourself

23
00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:30.410
Let's all split up

24
00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:40.920
Your newlywed life is good

25
00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:45.080
No wonder he is willing to die on these two cars
