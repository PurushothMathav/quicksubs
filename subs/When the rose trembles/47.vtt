00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.180
Do you want me to help you?

2
00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.620
Help a friend. Otherwise, you will see it when you wake up.

3
00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:12.110
Even if you see it. It's okay with you.

4
00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:15.570
It doesn't matter. I'm not here to hear you say it's okay.

5
00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:27.170
This is how you do this.

6
00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.700
Until you don't believe it. But sometimes it's despicable.

7
00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:37.870
problematic. It’s not that I don’t believe it.

8
00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:41.510
It's not necessary. Why is it not necessary?

9
00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:44.640
He has given up. Regardless of life or death.

10
00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:52.200
He won't even come back. Why did you get up so early?

11
00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:55.770
Long, one-day breakfast.

12
00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:05.690
This is not Huang Ji Zao. No. 1 Middle School is so far away.

13
00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.020
Something happened in the early morning. I drove to Radar and took the subway.

14
00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.960
Thank you, Lee. How many days in the morning?

15
00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:26.540
So it’s just a dream or something else.
