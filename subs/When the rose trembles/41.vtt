00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:02.680
Why? Someone else’s husband,

2
00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:08.420
Not all. My grandfather and father are like this.

3
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:17.130
Then my control is to go home. What about me.

4
00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:22.020
So do we. I don't know what your family is like.

5
00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:27.610
But in my house, that's it. You can't just go in and out.

6
00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.050
You also know that from childhood to adulthood,

7
00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:38.070
Nothing I do is easy. Although my husband is also

8
00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:40.550
Don’t say it, say it best,

9
00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.160
But, never let me do too badly.

10
00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:49.080
It turns out that this is the good life of successful people.

11
00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.290
No wonder he gave me a room before,

12
00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:58.400
Afraid of being compared to Xixing. What are you thinking about?

13
00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.460
What are you thinking? I just didn't expect it. Sit wherever you like, I'll talk more and raise your head

14
00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.980
You're not that serious anymore

15
00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:41.970
It’s pretty crazy to set up

16
00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.610
She is my daughter who was drafted in college

17
00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.440
You were drafted in college
