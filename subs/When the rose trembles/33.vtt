Brother Yue, why does this thing look so familiar?

2
00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:23.880
Where is the thing? This kind of burning thing? Where is the thing?

3
00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:26.980
I arrived at my hometown before. To be honest, I might have lost it.

4
00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.140
Where did you get it? That chicken head.

5
00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:37.520
No, Brother Yue, doesnâ€™t he want it?

6
00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:42.500
He was just angry. As long as I have a nice talk with him.

7
00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.500
Right, I'll apologize to him properly. oops,

8
00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.240
Are you crazy? What should I do?

9
00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.300
I can't handle it alone. OK,

10
00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:03.520
I'm not that kind. Pursue me here.

11
00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:06.180
Daughter, itâ€™s still too late for me to think about you now

12
00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:25.820
Why are you back selling flowers?

13
00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:27.810
Delivered indeed
