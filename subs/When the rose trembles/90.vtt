Add the length of the doorway. And asked me to give him your mobile phone number.

2
00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:07.300
If you're nearby, give me a call.

3
00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:13.340
right. He started acting like a ghost.

4
00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.880
It seemed like we were fast forwarding to the scene of the fire chase.

5
00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.200
But I think you, a petty Inter Milan guy who is involved in newlywed affairs, won’t look back.

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.240
Mr. Weather, it's time for you to have lunch.

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:33.910
Well, I don’t want to move.

8
00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.020

9
00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:46.430
tell you directly

10
00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:54.450
I haven’t thought about Xiaojian yet.

11
00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:01.540
at least three times

12
00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.340
I can open the presents first and eat first
