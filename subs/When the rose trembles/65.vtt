00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.160
Do you still do this?

2
00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:04.320
Well, do you want to make a helicopter?

3
00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:11.400
I'll check it out tomorrow and the car will be fine.

4
00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.090
What kind of advice? Come tomorrow morning?

5
00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:18.980
Are you okay?

6
00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:21.640
This has me. I baked this, not bought it.

7
00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:35.120
I haven't bought it on weekdays, but suddenly I want to make a plane.

8
00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.480
Wait, pretending to go tomorrow morning.

9
00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:44.420
As for not having to go to work tomorrow morning?

10
00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:49.910
It will be cut tomorrow morning.

11
00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.200
Turning around helps me put things off for a while. It's early tomorrow morning,

12
00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:58.810
I'm going to be watched by my wife for a sunrise.

13
00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:01.440
It was still early, so I just went out to buy her breakfast.

14
00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.480
We got up so early, why don’t we have breakfast?

15
00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:10.620
Stay there by yourself

16
00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:19.300
Can't sleep

17
00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:29.800
That’s because I don’t want to eat breakfast

18
00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.500
Think of another way
