00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:02.550
Your college electives were all fine arts.

The electives are all fine arts.

3
00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:17.130
They all chose art. Your college is very beautiful.

4
00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:19.940
Why did they all choose art?

5
00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:25.080
Thank you for your awareness. Who knows?

6
00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:28.240
Maybe it was a premonition that the future was so far away,

7
00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:35.700
So I wanted to get to know him in advance. You are a little less,

Blame me, are the elective courses in our school good?

10
00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:48.680

Ah crowd management

13
00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:57.560
Running materials and ancient pictures

14
00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:59.330
Is it related to merit or something?

15
00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.720
Still a little unhappy

16
00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.220
If I had known earlier, I would have chosen something related to biology. I would have regretted it.

17
00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:21.900
I regret it I regret it

18
00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.500
My eldest son will be cleared

19
00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.570
Since Madam regrets so much

20
00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.840
Then why don't I take another pronunciation test?

21
00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:35.190
