Want to get married. I've seen people.

Get company. Mom! What are you doing?

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.880
At least ask him what his name is. How old is this year?

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.020
Which school did you graduate from? How is your family situation?

5
00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.040
How many people are there? What kind of work do you do here?

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.020
How is the income? Has it been recaptured?

7
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.710
Why are you giving up? When do you plan to get married?

8
00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:28.220
Where are you going to tie the knot? There is more to say about the family village.

Need not. go. Come to me and get the red box from the banker version.

This card is the family estate left to you by your parents.

11
00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:46.490
This thing also belongs to your mother.

12
00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:49.260
Give it all back to you now. alright.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.460
I'm tired. I won't attend the wedding.

Iâ€™m going on vacation abroad in a few days

15
00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:57.830
Maybe I have to go back in a few days

16
00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.140
