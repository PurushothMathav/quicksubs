00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:08.220
Thank you. Miss Liu, you took advantage of me.

2
00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.490
I can understand that Miss Liu has this evil intention towards me.

3
00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:16.059
But there’s no need for this. I will be copied on you.

4
00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:18.680
Why were you copied? My money.

5
00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:22.840
I buy people's hearts and clothes for Xie Xie Cheng. Please brake the room again.

6
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:29.360
Is this okay? If it is inconvenient to take a break from reading,

7
00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:31.280
I can give you a discount on the clothes and room fee.

8
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:38.920
Do you think this is okay? You think I almost understand.

9
00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:43.740
My company is about to go public. You know right?

10
00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.020
So at this time,

11
00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:50.960
Nothing can happen to me and my company.

12
00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:55.630
Especially, when combined with an unknown woman,

13
00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:03.290
Well worth it for me and my company. So what?

14
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:09.580
Actually, it’s not that there are no other solutions.

15
00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:11.120
sir tonight

16
00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:12.840
As long as it can be done, I will definitely cooperate

17
00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:31.140
Several benefits of marriage

18
00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.280
What about after getting married?

19
00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:37.500
I think even if it's a family connection

20
00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.350
Xie's family is fine too

21
00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.080
Ms. Yang, how could I be here like that?

22
00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:45.920
People like us

23
00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:53.210
I was shocked. Will I be at a disadvantage?

24
00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:56.360
After all, our troops are out of reach

25
00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:04.370
Lou's accessories shop is interested, and so is the Xu's.

26
00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.360
Miss Lou, if you are really in trouble

27
00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:17.220
I have considered getting married. When will we meet today?

28
00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:24.800
I can do it by myself today

29
00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.760
This is what I should do. Thanks for talking.

30
00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:44.820
Hello, welcome to the home where you gather as soon as you arrive.
