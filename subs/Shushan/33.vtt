00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:01.100
Tang Zichen

2
00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:03.300
Look at the man you picked up

3
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:04.966
Relying on the Shushan sword in his hand

4
00:00:04.966 --> 00:00:06.933
He actually killed the Shushan bloodline in seconds

5
00:00:06.933 --> 00:00:08.400
He has a foreign surname

6
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.800
He actually said that our Shushan orthodoxy is Wan surname

7
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.100
What qualifications do you have?

8
00:00:12.266 --> 00:00:14.833
Obviously, he has helped us Shushan

9
00:00:15.066 --> 00:00:16.866
As his own pocket

10
00:00:16.866 --> 00:00:19.100
Little brother, although you have some skills

11
00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:20.666
But it's just a sideline

12
00:00:20.666 --> 00:00:21.966
I am from Shushan

13
00:00:21.966 --> 00:00:24.233
Gifted bloodline is especially important

14
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.733
I was able to understand the Sword Emperor Heart Sutra at the age of ten

15
00:00:27.733 --> 00:00:29.133
It is because of the respect of blood

16
00:00:29.133 --> 00:00:32.366
At the age of three, I can make the sect master nod with a sword

17
00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:33.900
Sound abstinence

18
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:36.100
Just with your kind of stuff

19
00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.200
Dare to say that you are a bloodline contention

20
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:39.266
Please forget it.

21
00:00:39.266 --> 00:00:41.200
We don't have to fight them for a living.

22
00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:42.933
I never planned to fight

23
00:00:42.933 --> 00:00:44.766
Wang Hu will want to have another kind of slave

24
00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.333
Shushan is mine

25
00:00:46.333 --> 00:00:49.033
And you Zhao and Tang families are the latecomers

26
00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.800
Dare to call me a foreign surname father

27
00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.066
You are enough, no matter how strong you are

28
00:00:54.066 --> 00:00:56.033
I can't say I'm a real classmate

29
00:00:56.133 --> 00:00:57.500
Shushan respects the sword

30
00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.666
Let the world see

31
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:01.066
What is justice?

32
00:01:01.066 --> 00:01:02.600
What is blood?

33
00:01:02.733 --> 00:01:05.466
Who are the so-called aliens?

34
00:01:10.566 --> 00:01:11.766
Arrows in the world

35
00:01:11.966 --> 00:01:12.866
Follow my orders
