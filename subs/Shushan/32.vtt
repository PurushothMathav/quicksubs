1
00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:02.466
Tang Yuanshan, as the eldest son of the Sword Sect

2
00:00:02.466 --> 00:00:04.200
How can you give in so easily?

3
00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:05.333
Qizong little sister

4
00:00:05.333 --> 00:00:06.900
I suggest you surrender

5
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:10.133
Now the Qizong is appropriately exquisite and the sect master's strength is tyrannical

6
00:00:10.133 --> 00:00:11.933
Once you become the Lord of Shushan

7
00:00:11.933 --> 00:00:14.100
You can open the Sword Emperor's Treasure

8
00:00:14.266 --> 00:00:18.300
You can become an existence like the Sword Emperor a thousand years ago

9
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.333
Now you're at the end of the road

10
00:00:20.333 --> 00:00:21.733
Why hold on

11
00:00:21.733 --> 00:00:22.000
Mo

12
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.800
Unless you still believe in the beggar you picked up

13
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.100
Can you turn the tide?

14
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:28.666
Little brother, you can either obey your sister

15
00:00:28.666 --> 00:00:31.600
Or don't blame my sister for forcibly tying you up mercilessly

16
00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.300
You are an alien after all

17
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.366
general trend

18
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:40.133
This Shu Mountain was opened by me thousands of years ago

19
00:00:40.133 --> 00:00:43.033
It's also said that you are the foreign surname

20
00:00:52.333 --> 00:00:54.400
Is it him?
