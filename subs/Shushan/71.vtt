00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.900
It turns out that this is the treasure house of the Demon Sect

2
00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:10.266
Demon Sect continues for thousands of years to produce files from various schools in the world

3
00:00:10.266 --> 00:00:11.666
Millennium Monuments

4
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.133
That's the library over there.

5
00:00:13.133 --> 00:00:14.833
This is the treasure

6
00:00:17.266 --> 00:00:19.600
There is the gate protected by the Demon Sect

7
00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:22.233
There is a kind of you who have guarded the clock for thousands of years and no one can break it

8
00:00:22.333 --> 00:00:25.300
The legendary treasure can be invincible in the world

9
00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:26.366
Would you like to try it?

10
00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:28.366
I am invincible

11
00:00:28.366 --> 00:00:30.066
Why be invincible

12
00:00:30.066 --> 00:00:32.266
Okay, I've finished reading this protection.

13
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:33.866
Take me to the spell of heatstroke

14
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:35.766
Oops, it's said in the spell

15
00:00:36.066 --> 00:00:38.066
Do you like me?

16
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.866
Wait a minute, the men are here.

17
00:00:39.866 --> 00:00:41.466
Please help me choose a treasure to take away

18
00:00:42.866 --> 00:00:45.500
Hmph, he's a beggar who can only bubble blindly

19
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.000
Dead mouse what keyboard

20
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.100
He's my fiance.

21
00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.266
If anyone dares to talk nonsense again, be careful I will kill you
