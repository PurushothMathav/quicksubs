1
00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:00.966
Who is it?

2
00:00:00.966 --> 00:00:02.866
He is the thief who took the Shushan Realm

3
00:00:02.866 --> 00:00:04.266
It's a foreigner from Shushan

4
00:00:04.266 --> 00:00:07.866
In mastering the many passages of Shushan Mountain, I have witnessed it with my own eyes

5
00:00:07.866 --> 00:00:10.100
He wants to steal Mount Shu

6
00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:11.300
See two of them

7
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.900
Fatty minister, it's not enough for you to lure wolves into the house

8
00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:16.866
Do you still want to take our Shushan to be buried together?

9
00:00:16.866 --> 00:00:18.966
Qi Yunruo really wants to steal Shushan

10
00:00:19.066 --> 00:00:20.800
I won't save you many times at all

11
00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.766
Shameless betrayal of Jianzong

12
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.766
And the face to insult others

13
00:00:24.766 --> 00:00:26.033
What do you know?

14
00:00:26.166 --> 00:00:27.466
Lord of Shushan

15
00:00:27.533 --> 00:00:29.433
The Sword Emperor's Treasure

16
00:00:29.533 --> 00:00:31.266
He's just using you

17
00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:33.566
Treasure what treasure

18
00:00:33.566 --> 00:00:34.533
Why haven't I heard of it?

19
00:00:34.533 --> 00:00:35.800
Don't play dumb.

20
00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.400
Tang Zichen use your brain to think about it

21
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:39.766
He is such a master

22
00:00:39.766 --> 00:00:42.033
If not for the Sword Emperor's treasure

23
00:00:42.066 --> 00:00:44.800
How could he pretend to be a beggar and sneak into Shushan?

24
00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.366
The reason why he saved you

25
00:00:46.366 --> 00:00:49.800
It's because no one in Shu Mountain can open the treasure

26
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.300
He will kill you when the treasure is opened
