1
00:00:00.566 --> 00:00:01.466
I don't agree with that.

2
00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:04.966
Jiang Yi, this is a good thing, why don't you agree?

3
00:00:04.966 --> 00:00:06.633
Do you have a say here?

4
00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:08.866
How did you talk to my mother?

5
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Xiaoya, your uncle is also thinking of you.

6
00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:17.233
What for me?

7
00:00:17.266 --> 00:00:19.366
He is Yufang at all

8
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.000
Why don't you go back first?

9
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.866
I'll discuss it with your uncle first

10
00:00:26.766 --> 00:00:27.566
Xiaoya

11
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.700
I'll come back to you next time.

12
00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.766
I don't understand.

13
00:00:37.766 --> 00:00:39.600
Why are you blocking their business?

14
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:40.933
Isn't that a good thing?

15
00:00:40.933 --> 00:00:42.066
They are still young

16
00:00:42.166 --> 00:00:43.566
What to do in a hurry to get married

17
00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.133
What does it matter if you meet the right person and get married early?

18
00:00:46.133 --> 00:00:46.800
I don't understand.

19
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:47.600
Why are you treating Xiaoya?

20
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.500
So concerned about emotional things

21
00:00:51.366 --> 00:00:52.866
Xiaoya is also my daughter

22
00:00:52.866 --> 00:00:54.533
Anyway, I have the final say in this family

23
00:00:54.533 --> 00:00:55.966
I said if you can't tie it, you can't tie it.

24
00:00:56.133 --> 00:00:58.000
Enough is enough

25
00:00:58.300 --> 00:00:59.633
I want to go out. I want to go in.

26
00:01:09.566 --> 00:01:11.700
Hello, is that Miss Xiaoya?

27
00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.000
I am you yes

28
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.533
What a coincidence to meet you

29
00:01:15.533 --> 00:01:16.366
It's the following.

30
00:01:16.366 --> 00:01:18.666
I am the planning director of Haotian Group

31
00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.033
We have a catwalk event tomorrow.

32
00:01:21.533 --> 00:01:22.800
Never found a good person

33
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.666
I've seen your catwalk before, it's great

34
00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:26.300
So?

35
00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.166
I would like to invite you to participate in our catwalk event.

36
00:01:28.166 --> 00:01:29.066
What do you think?

37
00:01:30.133 --> 00:01:32.400
Yes, I need to set makeup tonight.

38
00:01:32.466 --> 00:01:33.500
Do you have a minute?

39
00:01:36.333 --> 00:01:37.133
So late

40
00:01:37.533 --> 00:01:39.333
Time is very tight, I can't help it.

41
00:01:39.333 --> 00:01:40.133
So say

42
00:01:40.133 --> 00:01:41.266
I'll take you there directly.

43
00:01:41.266 --> 00:01:42.300
What do you think?

44
00:01:48.733 --> 00:01:49.833
Ok, please.

45
00:01:55.933 --> 00:01:57.900
Where is your company's dressing room?

46
00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:59.600
Why is this getting more and more biased?
