00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.933
Destroyed at your wedding before

2
00:00:01.933 --> 00:00:03.566
I'm really sorry.

3
00:00:03.566 --> 00:00:06.600
Hey, it's over, don't mention him, what about me?

4
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.200
I want to borrow some books from Xiaoya

5
00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:10.133
I wonder if you can take me there.

6
00:00:10.133 --> 00:00:11.366
Of course you can.

7
00:00:11.766 --> 00:00:13.766
It won't delay your trip, will it?

8
00:00:13.766 --> 00:00:15.600
It's okay, I'm just here to get my hair done

9
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.400
Any day. Let's go

10
00:00:23.733 --> 00:00:25.833
Xiaoya Shanshan is here

11
00:00:27.366 --> 00:00:30.266
Are you not at home? No

12
00:00:30.266 --> 00:00:31.533
When I go out in the morning

13
00:00:31.533 --> 00:00:33.500
He even asked me to come back and bring him food

14
00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:35.333
I'll find it for you.

15
00:00:35.333 --> 00:00:36.966
Ok Xiaoya

16
00:00:37.666 --> 00:00:38.466
Xiaoya

17
00:00:43.333 --> 00:00:44.700
What should I do when my mom comes back?

18
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.866
Don't worry, just pack up first

19
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.533
Mom, why are you back so early?

20
00:01:01.533 --> 00:01:02.566
Met Shanshan on the way

21
00:01:02.566 --> 00:01:05.033
He said he wanted to borrow a book from you, so I brought him back

22
00:01:05.166 --> 00:01:06.833
Why is your room so messy?

23
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.200
Ah, I was just sleeping.

24
00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.600
So I didn't clean up

25
00:01:12.533 --> 00:01:14.900
Why do you have a man's tie in this room?

26
00:01:15.666 --> 00:01:16.700
This is your uncle's tie
