00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:05.300
Hello, Sister Juan

2
00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:07.300
There is a brand catwalk in the evening.

3
00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:08.866
I got it for you.

4
00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:11.300
But my dad wants to come and find a way

5
00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:12.800
It will be here when it comes out.

6
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.200
See for yourself.

7
00:00:21.733 --> 00:00:22.533
Xiaoya

8
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.666
Mom, grandma, my friend asked me out to play at night

9
00:00:29.666 --> 00:00:31.233
I'll be home later today.

10
00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.933
Look at this child, this little girl!

11
00:00:35.933 --> 00:00:36.966
Probably in love

12
00:00:36.966 --> 00:00:39.433
See when I can't go to his current situation.

13
00:00:48.466 --> 00:00:50.833
Jiang Shanshan, why are you here?

14
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.566
I'm coming to the catwalk

15
00:00:53.366 --> 00:00:55.066
But Sister Juan is not

16
00:00:55.066 --> 00:00:57.500
Sister Juan has already given me your job

17
00:00:57.733 --> 00:00:59.733
Even if the pheasant flies to the branches

18
00:00:59.733 --> 00:01:01.666
It will still fall.

19
00:01:02.666 --> 00:01:04.533
Figure out your identity

20
00:01:04.533 --> 00:01:08.400
Little native cow, I'm going to rehearsal, do it yourself

21
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.166
You arranged it.

22
00:01:16.533 --> 00:01:18.033
Shanshan is my daughter

23
00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.666
Of course he did.

24
00:01:19.966 --> 00:01:21.166
Why don't you go?

25
00:01:21.166 --> 00:01:23.700
Why are we familiar?

26
00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:24.833
Li Xiaoya

27
00:01:25.466 --> 00:01:26.700
You need to know

28
00:01:27.066 --> 00:01:30.266
It's all up to me here

29
00:01:30.466 --> 00:01:32.466
Either you beg me

30
00:01:33.466 --> 00:01:35.633
Beg me to let you come back to me

31
00:01:39.766 --> 00:01:41.666
I won't die begging you
