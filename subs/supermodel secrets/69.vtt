00:00:03.166 --> 00:00:04.566
Supermodel Li Xiaoya has a baby

2
00:00:04.566 --> 00:00:07.133
The first show of his comeback after quitting the modeling industry

3
00:00:07.133 --> 00:00:08.400
a complete success

4
00:00:14.566 --> 00:00:17.800
I can't find any evidence for 5 years

5
00:00:18.666 --> 00:00:19.900
Why is that?

6
00:00:21.133 --> 00:00:22.600
Oh, why?

7
00:00:23.466 --> 00:00:26.633
Why can't I find any evidence?

8
00:00:27.266 --> 00:00:28.066
Salsa

9
00:00:28.666 --> 00:00:30.500
Maybe your dad was really chasing sheep by accident

10
00:00:31.066 --> 00:00:32.233
That's not possible.

11
00:00:33.366 --> 00:00:35.400
My dad is so cautious

12
00:00:35.766 --> 00:00:38.366
How could it be so careless?

13
00:00:38.666 --> 00:00:40.200
It must be Li Xiaoyao

14
00:00:40.533 --> 00:00:41.900
It must be Li Xiaoyao

15
00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.966
But we can't even find your father's teacher and mother

16
00:00:43.966 --> 00:00:45.466
We don't even have evidence

17
00:00:53.266 --> 00:00:54.566
You go to him

18
00:00:54.566 --> 00:00:56.600
Lure him into falling in love with you

19
00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.166
Then you escape

20
00:00:58.266 --> 00:01:01.000
They may have tried to hurt me

21
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.800
Shanshan

22
00:01:02.266 --> 00:01:03.600
Stop fooling around

23
00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.066
How does it hurt to wake up like this?

24
00:01:05.066 --> 00:01:06.833
Aren't you a detective?

25
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.166
Why don't you have any skills?

26
00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.766
Five years.

27
00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.966
In order to find evidence of murdering my father

28
00:01:13.966 --> 00:01:15.700
And inherit his inheritance

29
00:01:16.666 --> 00:01:19.066
If you can't do either of these things

30
00:01:19.666 --> 00:01:21.566
What's the point of being alive?

31
00:01:25.333 --> 00:01:26.133
Shanshan

32
00:01:26.466 --> 00:01:27.833
You calm down

33
00:01:28.566 --> 00:01:29.700
I promise you.

34
00:01:29.733 --> 00:01:32.933
I'll go but I don't know him at all

35
00:01:32.933 --> 00:01:34.800
How can I gain his trust?

36
00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:42.600
He takes his daughter to the children's playground every week

37
00:01:43.166 --> 00:01:45.666
You just go to him and get close to him

38
00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.666
You have to believe

39
00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.233
This world

40
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.433
Things you can't do without money

41
00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.100
123 Mom, have you hidden it?

42
00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:03.366
Don't peek

43
00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:24.200
Xiaonuo

44
00:02:25.533 --> 00:02:27.033
Xiaonuo Xiaonuo

45
00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:28.600
Xiaonuo Xiaonuo

46
00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:29.566
Don't scare mom

47
00:02:29.566 --> 00:02:31.500
What about Xiaonuo's phone?

48
00:02:32.666 --> 00:02:33.766
What about the phone?

49
00:02:36.666 --> 00:02:37.733
What's up?
