1
00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.666
This is a commercial property.

2
00:00:03.533 --> 00:00:06.000
Help me sell it. Why would he sell it?

3
00:00:06.266 --> 00:00:07.333
Here we go.

4
00:00:07.333 --> 00:00:09.700
You must remember every word I say

5
00:00:10.133 --> 00:00:12.766
Use the money from selling the store to help me find a few people

6
00:00:12.966 --> 00:00:14.500
Let them do one thing

7
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.900
Arrange for them to go abroad afterwards

8
00:00:17.766 --> 00:00:19.800
Including you remember

9
00:00:20.066 --> 00:00:21.900
Don't leave a trace

10
00:00:22.366 --> 00:00:25.700
The rest of the money is yours.

11
00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:28.033
Don't worry, I'll do it for you.

12
00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:34.166
As long as you say

13
00:00:34.333 --> 00:00:35.500
I believe

14
00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:41.566
Shanshan is my sister anyway

15
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.666
Why would I do such a thing?

16
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:45.300
OK

17
00:00:46.133 --> 00:00:47.300
I believe you.

18
00:00:48.466 --> 00:00:50.466
How are the formalities for going abroad?

19
00:00:51.466 --> 00:00:52.966
It's almost done.

20
00:00:57.333 --> 00:00:59.433
Then let's go for a walk in Phoenix Mountain again.

21
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:00.800
OK

22
00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.166
This should be the last time we see the port

23
00:01:13.166 --> 00:01:14.066
Is it city?

24
00:01:14.766 --> 00:01:15.766
Yes!

25
00:01:17.266 --> 00:01:18.866
When we go to America

26
00:01:21.566 --> 00:01:23.266
Everything will start over

27
00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:28.200
Jiang Yi

28
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.033
Oh, thank you kindly.
