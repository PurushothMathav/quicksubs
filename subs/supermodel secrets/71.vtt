00:00:00.566 --> 00:00:01.366
Why are you here?

2
00:00:01.366 --> 00:00:04.166
Have you forgotten how my father died?

3
00:00:04.166 --> 00:00:06.400
Are you afraid that I will tell your secret?

4
00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:07.566
What's my secret?

5
00:00:11.533 --> 00:00:13.466
Thank you ah hum

6
00:00:14.266 --> 00:00:15.566
Who are you?

7
00:00:15.666 --> 00:00:17.266
Is it his new prey?

8
00:00:17.266 --> 00:00:19.366
Don't blame me for not telling you in advance

9
00:00:19.366 --> 00:00:22.300
All those who are with him will become unfortunate

10
00:00:22.333 --> 00:00:24.600
If you want to stay with him

11
00:00:25.166 --> 00:00:27.100
You will be unfortunate too

12
00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:30.700
You don't have to worry about us.

13
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.633
Don't get complacent too early

14
00:00:32.966 --> 00:00:34.833
I will find evidence

15
00:00:40.466 --> 00:00:43.300
We'll see. OK.

16
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.233
The child's condition is not optimistic

17
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.566
Must be prepared to die alone immediately

18
00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:54.400
As long as I can save my daughter

19
00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.666
I accept whatever way

20
00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:58.600
The surgery costs 5 million

21
00:00:59.933 --> 00:01:01.800
OK, no problem.

22
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:03.200
I'll figure it out
