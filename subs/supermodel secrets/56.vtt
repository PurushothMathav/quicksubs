00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:03.566
What is it like to play mom and daughter at the same time?

2
00:00:06.366 --> 00:00:07.666
What are you talking about?

3
00:00:08.266 --> 00:00:09.666
I don't understand.

4
00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:14.500
Hey

5
00:00:15.133 --> 00:00:17.200
Stop pretending

6
00:00:17.733 --> 00:00:19.466
I already knew it

7
00:00:19.666 --> 00:00:20.066
You say

8
00:00:20.066 --> 00:00:22.766
If your stepmother knew about your relationship with Li Xiaoya

9
00:00:22.933 --> 00:00:24.300
What would he think?

10
00:00:24.366 --> 00:00:26.433
I don't know when he finds out

11
00:00:28.566 --> 00:00:30.233
How would you feel

12
00:00:33.066 --> 00:00:35.366
What do you want? What don't I want?

13
00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.466
Take the villa you live in now

14
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.700
Transfer to my name

15
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
And 5 million

16
00:00:46.866 --> 00:00:47.666
OK

17
00:00:48.333 --> 00:00:50.066
I'll transfer it to you tomorrow.

18
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.700
I ask you right now

19
00:00:52.766 --> 00:00:54.033
Get out of my office

20
00:00:55.666 --> 00:00:56.466
roll

21
00:01:05.533 --> 00:01:07.000
They're too cautious.

22
00:01:07.066 --> 00:01:08.833
Keep your distance at all times outside

23
00:01:08.866 --> 00:01:10.466
Don't go to the hotel to open a room at all

24
00:01:10.466 --> 00:01:12.933
I can't find the evidence. It's not outside

25
00:01:12.933 --> 00:01:14.700
Then it must be at home

26
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.000
Since we can't find evidence

27
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.233
Then we'll provoke their relationship

28
00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.566
Let them show their feet

29
00:01:22.566 --> 00:01:23.666
What do you mean?

30
00:01:26.533 --> 00:01:29.700
So you pretend to ask Li Xiaoya to get back together.

31
00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:30.966
Ask him out

32
00:01:30.966 --> 00:01:32.800
If he doesn't go out

33
00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.000
You tell me about him sleeping with a lot of old men

34
00:01:36.266 --> 00:01:38.766
Don't worry, wait until you don't speak

35
00:01:38.766 --> 00:01:40.766
He will follow you obediently

36
00:01:40.933 --> 00:01:42.433
And my dad

37
00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:46.500
Never allow his prey to be placed by others

38
00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:50.433
He's going to be furious

39
00:01:51.333 --> 00:01:53.866
So there is a gap between the two people

40
00:01:54.133 --> 00:01:57.200
Wouldn't it be easier for us to find evidence?

41
00:02:05.133 --> 00:02:06.233
Sit inside

42
00:02:07.266 --> 00:02:08.500
What are you doing here? Get out
