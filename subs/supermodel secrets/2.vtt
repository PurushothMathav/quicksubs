Little girl, are you alright?

2
00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:04.800
My company is nearby

3
00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.366
I'll take you back to change clothes

4
00:00:12.566 --> 00:00:13.400
Please say a few more words.

5
00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:14.633
What's new recently?

6
00:00:14.666 --> 00:00:15.700
Can you say a few words?

7
00:00:15.766 --> 00:00:16.700
Please take a look here

00:00:20.766 --> 00:00:22.900
Thank you, girl.

12
00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:24.400
Go uh

13
00:00:24.933 --> 00:00:26.600
This is our dressing room.

14
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.566
Are you interested in modeling?

15
00:00:32.366 --> 00:00:34.200
I am the agent of Chen Tian Entertainment

16
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.466
Everyone calls me Sister Juan

17
00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.433
Is there a salary for being a model?

18
00:00:39.266 --> 00:00:40.400
Of course there is.

19
00:00:40.966 --> 00:00:43.500
And you are famous

20
00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.400
With benefits, are you still afraid that those people will bully you?

21
00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.233
OK, I want to be a model.

22
00:00:49.133 --> 00:00:51.166
Ok, wait for me here.

23
00:00:54.866 --> 00:00:56.533
Where did the garbage come from?

24
00:00:56.533 --> 00:00:58.433
It stinks. It's you

25
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.566
You are also a model here

26
00:01:02.533 --> 00:01:04.400
You don't deserve to be a model here, do you?

27
00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:05.533
You native leopard

28
00:01:05.533 --> 00:01:07.566
Don't you see what your taste is?

29
00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.766
A model can't come temporarily tonight

30
00:01:11.966 --> 00:01:12.966
Replace it with

31
00:01:12.966 --> 00:01:13.766
Roll k

32
00:01:14.166 --> 00:01:16.300
By the way, what's your name?

Li Xiaoya

34
00:01:18.133 --> 00:01:20.233
Supermodels can't be called by that name

35
00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.166
From today on, your name is Phil

36
00:01:23.366 --> 00:01:24.666

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.466
Domestic second brand annual show game
