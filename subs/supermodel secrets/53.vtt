00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:02.500
You can hang out here

2
00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:03.966
I still buy so many things.

3
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.600
Here it is.

4
00:00:07.133 --> 00:00:08.800
Where did you get the money?

5
00:00:08.866 --> 00:00:10.566
Did my dad give it to you?

6
00:00:12.166 --> 00:00:14.200
Did you catch me 8 what 8

7
00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.433
Tell me when you're sick

8
00:00:16.533 --> 00:00:18.866
I'll give you double the price.

9
00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.066
Oh, I don't know.

10
00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:24.500
Triple hey hey

11
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.833
Miss, aren't you embarrassing me?

12
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.366
Fenying, I remember your son is going to college, right?

13
00:00:32.366 --> 00:00:34.200
So I let my mother

14
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.766
Take him to the best universities abroad

15
00:00:39.333 --> 00:00:41.466
I heard it with my own ears

16
00:00:41.466 --> 00:00:44.166
Mr. Jiang and Miss Xiaoya got together

17
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.800
No wonder my dad treats that Li Xiaoya

18
00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.866
Better than my own daughter

19
00:00:50.066 --> 00:00:52.066
Xiaoya, this bitch lady

20
00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.000
Please don't say I said that.

21
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.433
Otherwise, Mr. Jiang will definitely not let me go

22
00:00:56.566 --> 00:00:59.066
Fenying, don't worry.

23
00:00:59.066 --> 00:01:00.466
I won't say it.

24
00:01:06.166 --> 00:01:07.300
What's the matter, sister?

25
00:01:08.166 --> 00:01:10.500
My dad and Li Xiaoya leaned together

26
00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.866
We were all taken for fools, you know?

27
00:01:12.866 --> 00:01:13.900
How is that possible?

28
00:01:14.666 --> 00:01:16.066
My dad's nanny

29
00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:17.700
He told me himself

30
00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.000
It was because of this

31
00:01:20.266 --> 00:01:22.633
Uncle doesn't agree with my marriage to Xiaoya

32
00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.366
The adulterer

33
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:27.000
I'm going to kill them.

34
00:01:27.366 --> 00:01:28.766
Wait a minute.

35
00:01:28.866 --> 00:01:30.666
Don't get yourself involved

36
00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.266
I've got a better idea.

37
00:01:32.266 --> 00:01:33.266
How?

38
00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.266
If their adultery

39
00:01:38.733 --> 00:01:41.466
What would happen if Han Yun knew?

40
00:01:41.466 --> 00:01:43.800
No, Han Yi is innocent

41
00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.266
He was also in the dark

42
00:01:47.566 --> 00:01:50.200
Han Yun is Li Xiaoya's mother

43
00:01:50.266 --> 00:01:53.233
Li Xiaoya cares about him the most

44
00:01:53.566 --> 00:01:55.833
If Han Yun knew

45
00:01:56.266 --> 00:01:59.100
This is the greatest harm to Li Xiaoya

46
00:02:00.333 --> 00:02:01.300
I don't agree with that.

47
00:02:01.533 --> 00:02:03.266
We can't do this to you Han Yun

48
00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:07.800
You don't go I go

49
00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.533
What are you doing?

50
00:02:10.533 --> 00:02:11.933
Since they are having an affair

51
00:02:11.933 --> 00:02:13.900
We'll be able to catch them

52
00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.200
Threatening them without harming the meaning

53
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.266
Well, I'll follow my uncle

54
00:02:24.533 --> 00:02:25.900
You go follow Li Xiaoya

55
00:02:29.966 --> 00:02:30.833
aunt

56
00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.533
Are you also doing beauty here?

57
00:02:33.533 --> 00:02:34.600
You are Shanshan, right?

58
00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.000
Well, what can I do for you?
