00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:01.200
Ah!

2
00:00:01.533 --> 00:00:03.766
It's a dressing room contracted by our company in the suburbs

3
00:00:03.766 --> 00:00:05.100
It will arrive soon.

4
00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:06.200
Stop your car.

5
00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:07.300
I'm not going.

6
00:00:08.933 --> 00:00:10.400
I'm talking to you

7
00:00:10.733 --> 00:00:11.766
Parking

8
00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:13.966
I told you to stop

9
00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:17.033
I want to get out of the car and park

10
00:00:20.766 --> 00:00:22.400
Hello Mr. Jiang

11
00:00:22.533 --> 00:00:24.066
The person sent to follow Miss Xiaoya said

12
00:00:24.066 --> 00:00:25.400
Miss Xiaoya is missing

13
00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:26.766
What!

14
00:00:27.333 --> 00:00:28.566
Xiaoya is gone

15
00:00:33.866 --> 00:00:36.466
Summon someone immediately to the place where I sent the location. Hurry up.

16
00:00:48.866 --> 00:00:50.000
Where is this?

17
00:00:51.166 --> 00:00:52.166
Let go of me!

18
00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:57.066
Let me go

19
00:00:57.133 --> 00:00:58.100
What are you shouting?

20
00:00:58.733 --> 00:00:59.866
Louder

21
00:01:00.266 --> 00:01:02.600
Let's see who can come to your rescue today

22
00:01:03.066 --> 00:01:05.033
Mr. Zhang

23
00:01:05.166 --> 00:01:07.633
Why can't you just let me go?

24
00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.000
The first day you met me

25
00:01:10.066 --> 00:01:11.400
To tell you the truth

26
00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.366
I can't get what I want

27
00:01:16.333 --> 00:01:17.300
Including you.

28
00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.100
I will teach you a good lesson today

29
00:01:24.166 --> 00:01:25.800
Tell you what is abuse

30
00:01:25.866 --> 00:01:27.400
What is love?

31
00:01:28.466 --> 00:01:32.166
Shout, keep shouting, haha.

32
00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.066
You shout

33
00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:36.233
Let him go!
