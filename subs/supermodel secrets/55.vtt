00:00:02.266 --> 00:00:04.466
Why do you have a man's tie in this room?

2
00:00:04.866 --> 00:00:06.300
This is your uncle's tie

3
00:00:07.333 --> 00:00:09.300
This is an assignment for our costume class

4
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.266
I used my uncle's tie as a reference

5
00:00:11.366 --> 00:00:14.200
You have this assignment in your costume class

6
00:00:14.533 --> 00:00:17.100
Yes, if you don't believe me, you can ask Shanshan.

7
00:00:19.533 --> 00:00:21.700
What's wrong with your neck?

8
00:00:22.333 --> 00:00:24.266
What's wrong with the neck?

9
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:26.500
Nothing.

10
00:00:27.166 --> 00:00:28.766
Shanshan is waiting for you downstairs

11
00:00:37.866 --> 00:00:39.400
Shanshan Xiaoya is here

12
00:00:39.666 --> 00:00:40.366
Shanshan

13
00:00:40.366 --> 00:00:42.933
The tie is for our costume class, right?

14
00:00:42.933 --> 00:00:45.466
Tie, right?

15
00:00:45.466 --> 00:00:48.800
Tie? Yeah.

16
00:00:48.933 --> 00:00:50.666
Shanshan, don't you want to borrow books?

17
00:00:50.666 --> 00:00:51.866
Let Xiaoya take you to find it.

18
00:00:51.866 --> 00:00:54.000
Yes, let's go, thank Auntie, let's go

19
00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:58.600
Oh, dear.

20
00:01:00.466 --> 00:01:01.366
Stop pretending

21
00:01:01.366 --> 00:01:03.633
I already know about your affair with my dad

22
00:01:04.066 --> 00:01:06.966
I don't understand what you're saying. I don't understand

23
00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:08.400
I'll tell you what.

24
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.733
You got away with it this time, and next time

25
00:01:11.733 --> 00:01:12.966
Next time.

26
00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.766
You don't get so lucky every time.

27
00:01:20.333 --> 00:01:21.366
We'll see.

28
00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.766
I don't think it's good for us to hide it from Mom like this

29
00:01:30.866 --> 00:01:32.266
I want to be honest with him.

30
00:01:32.533 --> 00:01:35.100
Maybe he will fulfill us. Okay, Xiaoya

31
00:01:35.666 --> 00:01:36.833
Oh, I see.

32
00:01:37.066 --> 00:01:39.166
Do you feel sorry for your mother?

33
00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.966
Don't worry, I promise to find a suitable opportunity.

34
00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.033
We both knelt before him

35
00:01:45.166 --> 00:01:47.033
Ask him to fulfill us, okay?

36
00:01:48.166 --> 00:01:49.500
All right, bye bye.

37
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:51.933
So free today

38
00:01:51.933 --> 00:01:52.966
No need to train

39
00:01:52.966 --> 00:01:54.100
I miss my dad

40
00:01:56.533 --> 00:01:57.333
Dad?

41
00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.500
What is it like to play mom and daughter at the same time?
