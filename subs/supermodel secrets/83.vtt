00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:01.500
What!

2
00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:03.800
Li Xiaoya is getting married

3
00:00:03.866 --> 00:00:06.333
Yes, and there will be a wedding soon.

4
00:00:06.333 --> 00:00:07.633
Why?

5
00:00:08.733 --> 00:00:11.066
Why can he get away with it all?

6
00:00:11.533 --> 00:00:12.866
Absolutely impossible

7
00:00:12.966 --> 00:00:14.466
There must be a way

8
00:00:15.066 --> 00:00:16.633
There must be a way

9
00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:18.433
Li Xiaoya

10
00:00:19.133 --> 00:00:20.333
Not absolute

11
00:00:20.333 --> 00:00:22.700
I will never let you accept this marriage

12
00:00:23.766 --> 00:00:25.166
Shanshan, calm down

13
00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.033
We can't organize a wedding

14
00:00:28.966 --> 00:00:31.366
As long as you do as I say

15
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:33.266
How?

16
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.466
Ah what an international joke

17
00:00:40.566 --> 00:00:42.033
You don't have to.

18
00:00:42.566 --> 00:00:46.233
You just need to help me get the stuff

19
00:00:46.466 --> 00:00:48.700
No, it's against the law.

20
00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:49.966
You will go to jail too

21
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.466
Hahaha

22
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.100
go to jail

23
00:00:53.733 --> 00:00:55.900
I don't want to live anymore

24
00:00:57.566 --> 00:00:59.466
My dad was killed by him

25
00:01:00.133 --> 00:01:02.566
I was ruined by him

26
00:01:03.166 --> 00:01:05.400
He Li Xiaoya, why should he?

27
00:01:05.533 --> 00:01:08.500
Why should he live a happy life?

28
00:01:09.133 --> 00:01:10.500
You don't do it

29
00:01:11.333 --> 00:01:12.300
OK

30
00:01:13.266 --> 00:01:15.600
I'll do it, wait.

31
00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:17.666
I'll help you.

32
00:01:18.933 --> 00:01:19.966
same joy

33
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.833
Li Xiaoya married my cousin

34
00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.733
What does it feel like?

35
00:01:27.733 --> 00:01:29.566
Cousin, why are you here?
