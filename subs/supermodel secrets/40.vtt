00:00:00.566 --> 00:00:02.400
Just kidding, you can go away

2
00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:07.066
Don't worry about what we're talking about.

3
00:00:07.133 --> 00:00:10.166
I, Zhang Yufeng, keep my word, thank you, big brother.

4
00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:11.366
I'll go first then.

5
00:00:11.533 --> 00:00:13.100
Go go go go go

6
00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:17.000
Xiaoya, are you alright?

7
00:00:17.466 --> 00:00:18.666
What are you doing here?

8
00:00:19.366 --> 00:00:21.400
Xiaoya, I'm sorry.

9
00:00:21.566 --> 00:00:23.066
I misunderstood you

10
00:00:23.866 --> 00:00:25.466
I heard about Carl

11
00:00:25.466 --> 00:00:27.300
I thought you were good friends

12
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.700
Who is his good friend?

13
00:00:28.766 --> 00:00:30.700
You believe what others say, right?

14
00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:31.866
I was wrong.

15
00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:33.933
I shouldn't have listened to others.

16
00:00:33.933 --> 00:00:35.700
But I don't trust my girlfriend

17
00:00:36.333 --> 00:00:38.500
He did so many things to you that were too much for him

18
00:00:39.366 --> 00:00:41.266
I'll hit you hit me

19
00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.800
Who wants to hit you? I still think my hand hurts

20
00:00:44.133 --> 00:00:45.800
Then I'll do it myself.

21
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.233
Hey what are you doing

22
00:00:48.133 --> 00:00:48.933
Xiaoya

23
00:00:49.366 --> 00:00:50.633
I figured it out.

24
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.333
I love you for who you are

25
00:00:52.333 --> 00:00:53.666
Rather than your past

26
00:00:53.666 --> 00:00:55.333
I don't care what you've done before.

27
00:00:55.333 --> 00:00:56.666
I wouldn't mind.

28
00:00:58.666 --> 00:00:59.633
I don't have it.

29
00:01:00.366 --> 00:01:01.800
I know. I know!

30
00:01:04.533 --> 00:01:06.200
You give me one last chance

31
00:01:06.333 --> 00:01:08.300
Trust me once, okay?

32
00:01:10.066 --> 00:01:11.000
OK

33
00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:13.433
Trust you again

34
00:01:15.533 --> 00:01:17.700
Really? That's great.

35
00:01:18.333 --> 00:01:22.766
Ah what are you doing, why are you coming down hahaha

36
00:01:24.566 --> 00:01:25.366
Xiaoya

37
00:01:25.533 --> 00:01:28.000
It will be your birthday in a few days. What do you want to do?

38
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.733
Well, just have a simple meal

39
00:01:30.733 --> 00:01:31.600
No way.

40
00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.466
My daughter Jiang Yi wants the best of everything

41
00:01:34.666 --> 00:01:36.366
Don't waste it.

42
00:01:36.366 --> 00:01:37.900
It's okay, I'll arrange it.

43
00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.233
Wow, it's beautiful. Yeah.
