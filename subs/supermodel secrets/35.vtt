00:00:01.333 --> 00:00:02.166
Mr. Jiang

2
00:00:02.933 --> 00:00:04.766
How dare you be my girlfriend

3
00:00:05.166 --> 00:00:07.033
Who are you? What are you talking about?

4
00:00:07.266 --> 00:00:08.366
Play dumb, right?

5
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.066
Something happened in President Jiang's office, you are rich and powerful

6
00:00:11.066 --> 00:00:12.866
Why are you bullying us poor people?

7
00:00:12.866 --> 00:00:14.400
Why did you rape my girlfriend?

8
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:15.266
I was never strong

9
00:00:15.266 --> 00:00:16.600
Force a woman to do something she doesn't like

10
00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:17.966
Are you mistaken?

11
00:00:26.166 --> 00:00:28.766
Xiaoya, please save my boyfriend

12
00:00:28.866 --> 00:00:31.200
How can I save him?

13
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.000
Please help me intercede with Mr. Jiang

14
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.933
Let him put my boyfriend away

15
00:00:34.933 --> 00:00:36.700
I know you have a good relationship.

16
00:00:36.966 --> 00:00:39.066
What do you mean?

17
00:00:40.866 --> 00:00:42.100
Sorry Xiaoya

18
00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:44.666
I lied to you before.

19
00:00:45.166 --> 00:00:48.166
Mr. Jiang didn't rape me

20
00:00:48.166 --> 00:00:49.466
Can you say that again?

21
00:00:49.466 --> 00:00:52.533
Mr. Jiang danced with me that day just to piss you off

22
00:00:52.533 --> 00:00:54.433
Nothing happened after that.

23
00:00:54.666 --> 00:00:56.466
I lied to everyone.

24
00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:00.633
Why did you lie to me?

25
00:01:01.566 --> 00:01:04.500
I'm jealous of you coming to the company and making the finale appearance

26
00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.400
I'm jealous that you have Mr. Jiang as a backer

27
00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.166
So many opportunities

28
00:01:10.333 --> 00:01:13.866
Xiaoya, please let Mr. Jiang let us go

29
00:01:13.866 --> 00:01:16.466
I will never dare to talk nonsense again

30
00:01:16.933 --> 00:01:18.766
I consider you my best friend

31
00:01:18.766 --> 00:01:20.666
Why are you doing this to me?

32
00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.766
I just want to live well with the people I love

33
00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.200
Why did you force me to be like this?

34
00:01:28.266 --> 00:01:31.266
It's over. It's over

35
00:01:31.766 --> 00:01:33.100
My Happiness

36
00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.733
It's all destroyed by you

37
00:01:35.733 --> 00:01:37.600
I will never forgive you for the rest of my life
