1
00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:05.100
Then what do you think our relationship is now?

2
00:00:05.333 --> 00:00:07.666
What relationship do you say?

3
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.866
Then if we stay together

4
00:00:10.866 --> 00:00:12.400
Will you marry me?

5
00:00:14.166 --> 00:00:15.766
Get married

6
00:00:18.533 --> 00:00:20.366
Xiaoya, stop making trouble.

7
00:00:20.533 --> 00:00:22.800
We just get what we want.

8
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.000
Take what you need

9
00:00:32.066 --> 00:00:32.866
Right

10
00:00:33.866 --> 00:00:35.366
As long as you are with me

11
00:00:35.466 --> 00:00:36.733
Chance to perform

12
00:00:36.733 --> 00:00:38.066
Luxury car

13
00:00:38.066 --> 00:00:40.800
I can give you all the money you can spend on the house

14
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.833
But it's impossible to get married

15
00:00:43.766 --> 00:00:47.166
So we're just a transactional

16
00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:48.166
Right?

17
00:00:50.366 --> 00:00:52.000
Since you are not sincere to me

18
00:00:52.366 --> 00:00:54.933
Then there's no need for us to continue

19
00:00:54.933 --> 00:00:56.100
As long as you don't get married

20
00:00:56.133 --> 00:00:58.300
I can buy a house and pay for it in your name

21
00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.200
You can also help your family pay off all its debts

22
00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.033
What else are you dissatisfied with?

23
00:01:02.066 --> 00:01:03.866
Do you think I am a commodity?

24
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.000
As long as you have money

25
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.900
You can play with my feelings at will

26
00:01:11.066 --> 00:01:12.700
What's wrong? I regret it.

27
00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.233
If you dream, I will not regret death

28
00:01:15.466 --> 00:01:16.733
I don't want your stuff.

29
00:01:16.733 --> 00:01:18.766
I will accept more people in the future

30
00:01:18.766 --> 00:01:20.000
I don't need your charity.
