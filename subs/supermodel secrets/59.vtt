00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.633
Beating myself. Beating myself.

2
00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:05.633
I keep hitting myself. What are you talking about?

3
00:00:05.766 --> 00:00:07.300
I forgive you, okay?

4
00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:09.400
Get up, are you still going?

5
00:00:09.866 --> 00:00:11.200
I'm not leaving.

6
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.066
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

7
00:00:18.333 --> 00:00:19.133
Korean

8
00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.066
I'm really sorry yesterday.

9
00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:22.633
I am for you today

10
00:00:22.666 --> 00:00:24.700
Prepared an exclusive package for the hairdresser.

11
00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:26.733
There are also treatment packages from high-end beauty salons.

12
00:00:26.733 --> 00:00:29.266
He also specially prepared a truckload of gifts for you to bring him

13
00:00:29.566 --> 00:00:30.966
Give it to our mother for me

14
00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:32.600
Do your filial piety for me

15
00:00:32.733 --> 00:00:35.266
I'm too busy in the company today to get away

16
00:00:35.733 --> 00:00:37.600
I also hope you understand and tolerate it.

17
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.066
Okay, will my daughter accompany me?

18
00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.600
I'm not going then.

19
00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.266
I have to catch up today with my homework due on Monday.

20
00:00:47.333 --> 00:00:49.466
Gotta be at home

21
00:00:49.466 --> 00:00:51.433
Then I'll have to enjoy it alone.

22
00:00:52.333 --> 00:00:53.433
Have fun.

23
00:00:53.933 --> 00:00:56.366
OK, then I'll take you to the hair salon first.

24
00:00:56.366 --> 00:00:57.533
Then I go to work

25
00:00:57.533 --> 00:00:58.666
Thank you husband

26
00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.800
Don't be so Xiaoya

27
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:13.900
Yesterday was all my fault

28
00:01:14.333 --> 00:01:16.566
I shouldn't have quarreled with you and your mother

29
00:01:18.466 --> 00:01:20.000
Please forgive me.

30
00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:21.766
OK.

31
00:01:24.166 --> 00:01:25.800
Then I'll give you another chance.

32
00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:27.700
But if you do this again

33
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.100
I won't forgive you again

34
00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.066
Just as you said

35
00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.666
Auntie, I have something to tell you, Shanshan.

36
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.600
Do you have anything to tell me?

37
00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.366
Li Xiaoya and my dad have been together for a long time
