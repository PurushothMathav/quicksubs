00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:05.980
What are you? Are you okay?

2
00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:09.500
What's wrong with mine?

3
00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:10.980
Didn't you say that mom is ill?

4
00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:13.340
This is just a street corner

5
00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:15.810
It's something to bring you back

6
00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.160
The one who wasn't killed back then

7
00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.960
People said they needed to find someone to settle the score with.

8
00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:24.880
You take it back

9
00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:26.420
I'll do the math for you.

10
00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:29.000
I didn't come back three times after so many years

11
00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:34.490
So many marriages

12
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:40.760
Call you and show up

13
00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:44.020
I'm annoying you. I haven't eaten yet.

14
00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:45.080
Repaired and released

15
00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:46.780
These phases of the building are actually quite a bit...

16
00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:48.810
Is it true that we can see everything in one issue?

17
00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:58.110
I said I was afraid that I would be able to feed my son a little bit. Come down.

18
00:00:58.870 --> 00:00:59.670
Eaten and destroyed

19
00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.680
We We We We We We We We We We We We We We We We We We We We We We We We We We We We We We We We We We We We We We We We We We

20
00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:06.280
We, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we We, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we We, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we We, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we
