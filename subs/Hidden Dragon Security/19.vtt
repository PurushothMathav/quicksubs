00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:02.990
It's a disease. What are you talking nonsense about?

2
00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:04.690
Itâ€™s been ten years since your mother

3
00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.300
Your father didn't go back, so how could she have an illegitimate child?

4
00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.980
Why did she break up with me because of you and the security guard?

5
00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:14.590
Your father retired from the army and started his own business from scratch.

6
00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:16.530
Now standing on the electric red,

7
00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:18.970
She does things her own way.

8
00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:22.160
It's a mistake. If she doesn't recognize it, I won't recognize her.

9
00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:25.220
Then do you know that your father flew to the late stage,

10
00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:27.580
She doesn't have much time?

11
00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:28.670
What did you say?

12
00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:33.560
My dad, what are you doing?

13
00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.320
My dad really flew in late.

14
00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:40.370
So what did he ask you to do?

15
00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:41.390
Just do whatever you want

16
00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:42.910
Can't be wrong

17
00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.890
Then I know

18
00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:51.290
do something

19
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.440
Although I was asked to personally hire a security guard to get married

20
00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:56.010
Although I still do it myself

21
00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:06.880
Why is this security guard still in the Electrical Department? Are you okay?
