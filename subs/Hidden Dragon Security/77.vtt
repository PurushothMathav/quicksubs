00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.280
By the way, what did you get?

2
00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:15.650
Open it and take a look. Who are you and them?

3
00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:17.820
Then I, the East, will tell you what I hear.

4
00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:21.080
I have a bad temper, you'd better do as I say.

5
00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.750
So, on the first day of heavy rain, why should I stand aside?

6
00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:28.480
I advise you to leave Mr. But I have to take care of it,

7
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.460
next time. You and the others will die early,

8
00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.200
Right. I'll give you three seconds,

9
00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:36.780
One horse hour. Don't bark,

10
00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:38.950
I let you die and I am all dead.

11
00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:41.830
No need to give me face, come with me. You just find it yourself.
