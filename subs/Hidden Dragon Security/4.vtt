00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:03.620
That Brother Dan knows you are coming today,

2
00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:06.300
No, go ahead and prepare it for you.

3
00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:08.700
What is money called?

4
00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.290
Never mind, it's nothing.

5
00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:13.870
Come on, brother, don't look at him.

6
00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:20.310
Five hundred, how is it enough?

7
00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:24.020
What happened? Before? Before?

8
00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:27.680
That Brother Dan, I am just a knot maker,

9
00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:28.340
I'm alone...

10
00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:29.700
What's your name?

11
00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:31.560
Give it, don’t give it yet.

12
00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.010
What is this money called?

13
00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:37.870
Otherwise, why don’t you talk too much about anything?

14
00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:40.830
Don't, don't, don't, brother

15
00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:42.230
this is my son

16
00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:44.370
I just came back from working outside.

17
00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:45.270
I know something

18
00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:46.970
Don't be like him

19
00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:49.150
Just came back from work, you said

20
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:52.120
That means being very rich

21
00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:53.830
Another thousand

22
00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:58.480
You make it clear

23
00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:00.000
What kind of money does this cost?

24
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.060
Made it clear

25
00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:01.940
Give me as much as you want

26
00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:06.660
They're talking about protection money

27
00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:09.280
They want the American League to give them some money.

28
00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.120
This will ensure that nothing happens to our family

29
00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.680
This room is gorgeous

30
00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:14.520
How can such a thing happen?

31
00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:24.120
You want money, right? You said it, you want money?

32
00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:24.560
I don't even know

33
00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:28.540
There is suspicion here that customary law has its own

34
00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:29.680
Came here on my own
