00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:05.700
Red light, brain circle, let’s go. Okay, see you later.

2
00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:13.010
I can't help myself.

3
00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:14.420
What are you looking for at least?

4
00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:16.200
I'll call you again tomorrow to ask you.

5
00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:18.510
Is it at least possible? What can I accomplish by speaking?

6
00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:21.580
Yes, then you haven’t solved the problem, right?

7
00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:22.480
What didn't you do?

8
00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:24.400
What not to do?

9
00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.680
Then meeting women is something progressive people do.

10
00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.290
Then meet a man

11
00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:30.620
It should be worth it

12
00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:32.060
Okay, don't talk too late

13
00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:34.040
You still want to help me and help you?

14
00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.600
I'll call you and ask you now

15
00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:43.610
tomorrow night

16
00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:46.390
Help me make it the most beautiful wine table.

17
00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:47.410
Can call all situations

18
00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:52.800
tomorrow night

19
00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:56.760
Is it true that Nonghua can see you? Don’t worry.

20
00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:57.500
I can say something

21
00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:00.800
Don't you think it's going to be so fast tonight?

22
00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:02.080
Thank you. Thank you. Let's go.
