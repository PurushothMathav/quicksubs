00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:32.310
Come on then. There's still something delicious to eat.

2
00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:36.880
What can I say back?

3
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.580
What about me?

4
00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:42.280
Since I promised you to go back, I will naturally go back.

5
00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:46.840
But before I go back, I still have a little waist.

6
00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:49.300
Don't be wrong

7
00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.220
What about you? You have a strong personality.

8
00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:52.480
I have a bad temper

9
00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:54.230
This is to avoid later

10
00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:55.690
You pissed me off again

11
00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:57.290
I left with another row of butts

12
00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:59.050
So you will go to work

13
00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:04.170
You have to listen to me then don't you

14
00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:06.410
Figure out your identity

15
00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.990
It's a little treasure

16
00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:09.540
I'm the older half

17
00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.940
you made a mistake

18
00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:14.640
Now you want to ask me to go back to work

19
00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.860
Then I am a noble soldier. Do you understand? Letâ€™s go.
