00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:02.980
Don't be afraid of what to do

2
00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:04.600
This guy is a dog

3
00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:16.620
If you can't do it, run away quickly?

4
00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:29.430
Girl ok ok

5
00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:35.480
I just asked you to do artificial respiration for you.

6
00:00:44.160 --> 00:01:00.630
I should go on a journey for you, right? Of course

7
00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:14.290
Hasn't it been sitting on the horse's legs for too long? Can you push a little bit? Why don't you push a little bit quickly and let's catch up?

8
00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:16.580
It's probably because the brain has been in captivity for too long and the nerves have been damaged.

9
00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:26.680
But go and get treatment

10
00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:27.460
Oh, why don't you take him off?
