00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:10.940
My dad has left,

2
00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.970
When you come, you will always know me to pick you up,

3
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.380
I also hope that our various masters can complement each other.

4
00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:24.630
We know each other, and if we do, we should talk about this unit.

5
00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:26.770
Did you say?

6
00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:29.310
I also know the host who can divide my work every day,

7
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.150
You have to know how long the group has to wait, and you canâ€™t get it back.

8
00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:36.530
What do you mean?

9
00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:39.170
I mean, if you say,

10
00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:41.910
It means that it belongs to the subject, and it is up to him to know it.

11
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.640
For the group, Hua Dan will be better.

12
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:52.600
I will know, let me know, let me know.

13
00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.510
How to deal with functions that are not suitable for public use?

14
00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:58.430
Will the intensity be there? Yes, there will be support for the strong team's bureau.

15
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:00.960
easy advantage

16
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:02.900
After all, he has become a walking bomber.

17
00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:04.319
We can't live any closer

18
00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:09.850
I went there and found out why

19
00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:14.530
We may wish to do the following this time

20
00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:16.930
Go out first and continue

21
00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:20.450
Oops, this was released in the past
