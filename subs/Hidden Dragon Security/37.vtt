15
00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:44.860
Many people ask me to ask

16
00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:46.100
I would say something like this

17
00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:47.940
I donâ€™t want to have a bad financial day today

18
00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:51.120
Because I seem to be talking about eating today

19
00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:53.040
Don't be too down on your feet, right?

20
00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:57.420
If you have too much to say, please tell me

21
00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:58.980
How do you want me to help you?

22
00:00:58.980 --> 00:00:59.920
Please help me first

23
00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:01.210
Sometimes

24
00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.550
How about I give you some more money, dad?

25
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:10.360
You little dragon, go to my house, dad.

26
00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:11.940
Is something going on between you two?

27
00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.700
What else will our fighting company give away?

28
00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:15.590
