00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:01.730
Big brother, big brother,

2
00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:03.880
Brother, I'm sorry,

3
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.140
Then don't be like you,

4
00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:08.400
It should be over there,

5
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:09.280
Spend your life.

6
00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:13.920
Mom, don't say it, let's go,

7
00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:17.140
So who do I want to see and what do you do?

8
00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:20.640
Do I know how you can lead me without knowing the words?

9
00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:22.600
I want to see that you are not a dirty person

10
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:23.460
can you help help you

11
00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:26.730
Look what I do

12
00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.540
I don’t know the words. When can you help me?

13
00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:30.490
Excuse me

14
00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:32.890
What do I do as a yellow belt?

15
00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:35.010
Why can I see you even if I can't recognize the words?

16
00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.030
I can see you even if I don’t know the words

17
00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:39.420
I once said you didn’t know the words or words

18
00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:40.980
How easy is it for me and the director?

19
00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:42.100
What did you say

20
00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:43.530
I'm no longer a guarantor

21
00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:44.530
Didn’t I keep my promise to the director?
