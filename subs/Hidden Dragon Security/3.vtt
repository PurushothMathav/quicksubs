00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:03.760
Xiaolong, I’m sorry,

2
00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:05.750
This woman of mine has spoiled me,

3
00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:06.770
There are no rules at all.

4
00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:09.960
It's okay. He also said that I am most hurt by the good-tuned education and the chicken-waisted fox nature.

5
00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:11.640
A person with a tough and tough temper.

6
00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:17.780
Although you are a treasure, I can see strong deception in you.

7
00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:20.390
It will definitely become a big bully in the future.

8
00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.280
I will try my best and won't let you down.

9
00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:27.480
OK, but the video is pretty cool on this.

10
00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:31.910
How about this? I'll ask you to be a security guard in our company first.

11
00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:34.750
Mr. An Zhongbao, he is gradually becoming more beautiful,

12
00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:35.350
What do you think?

13
00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.020
He also said that you saved me and my mother back then

14
00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:40.370
Beating people without mercy

15
00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.590
what do you need me to do now

16
00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:44.130
All is ok

17
00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:45.430
I think it's normal

18
00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:46.750
Sure enough, I didn’t see the wrong person.

19
00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:48.160
That's right

20
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:50.960
Then I'll go back to see her mother first

21
00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:18.630
I will go to the company tomorrow to report that my mother, Laolong, is back. My son is back.

22
00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:20.910
Seriously, where have you been today?

23
00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:22.050
Some news for you

24
00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:24.230
You don’t even give it to me, your mother

25
00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:26.250
I've been doing some things abroad in the past few years

26
00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:27.580
No way to contact you

27
00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:30.140
Just come back and ask for help

28
00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.760
Come back this time and won’t leave, right?

29
00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.680
Aren't you leaving? I plan to

30
00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.360
Overnight company in Dabaoan

31
00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.740
You said it, you said it too

32
00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:40.830
It's our place, why don't you stay the night?

33
00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:43.090
That's great. Hurry up and make money.
