00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:05.000
Okay, you try the same thing.

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:07.270
The drum force is for you to try on your own hands,

3
00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:09.290
Protect the entire trial, as well as your family.

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:11.450
The hand tells you not to be presumptuous and protect the whole try,

5
00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:12.950
And you, too. The hand tells you not to be presumptuous, to protect the whole try, you laugh, after all, you laugh,

6
00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:15.800
After all, it is, you laugh, after all, you laugh, after all, you laugh,

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:34.670
You laugh, after all, itâ€™s you and me holding hands

11
00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:44.980
Is it true that they give you a hand fold over there?
