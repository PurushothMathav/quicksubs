00:00:00.566 --> 00:00:04.433
Spring fishing grass and summer fishing algae

2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.800
The squid is hooked, haha.

3
00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:12.300
Ah!

4
00:00:12.733 --> 00:00:14.966
Hey

5
00:00:30.766 --> 00:00:31.666
Meet Dr. Xu

6
00:00:31.666 --> 00:00:34.000
Doctor Xu's father Shen Wan was seriously ill

7
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.266
I hope you can help.

8
00:00:35.266 --> 00:00:38.566
No time. Today is my third wedding anniversary.

9
00:00:38.566 --> 00:00:40.700
I'm still rushing back to make fish soup for my wife

10
00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.600
Xu Shenyi, my name is Shen Tingting

11
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:43.800
It was introduced by President Wang

12
00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.133
President Wang, then you should know my rules, right?

13
00:00:46.133 --> 00:00:47.100
Naturally understand

14
00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:48.966
Doctor Xu, as long as you help

15
00:00:48.966 --> 00:00:50.500
I will serve the dragon heart grass

16
00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.866
There are also hundreds of billions of orders from your wife's Gao family and Shen family.

17
00:00:52.866 --> 00:00:55.066
If there are some, I will accept them together.

18
00:00:55.066 --> 00:00:58.000
Lan Lan will be very happy to get this order.

19
00:01:00.333 --> 00:01:03.300
Hey, get back here and divorce my daughter

20
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.400
Mom, why do you want me to divorce Lan Lan?

21
00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.666
Shut up mom, you can call it too

22
00:01:11.666 --> 00:01:13.600
I don't have your useless son-in-law

23
00:01:15.666 --> 00:01:16.700
Do you see it?

24
00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:19.600
Lanlan's worth has exceeded 10 billion

25
00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.466
On the cover of Time magazine

26
00:01:22.466 --> 00:01:27.766
The rich and young people in Yuncheng are all lined up to pursue blue and blue

27
00:01:28.933 --> 00:01:31.566
You don't even look at your weight

28
00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.666
Learn to fish every day

29
00:01:33.666 --> 00:01:36.166
What else do you do besides fishing?

30
00:01:36.166 --> 00:01:37.966
What are you worthy of Lan Lan?

31
00:01:37.966 --> 00:01:39.633
But what am I?

32
00:01:39.866 --> 00:01:41.700
If you have any conscience

33
00:01:42.066 --> 00:01:44.400
Sign the divorce quickly

34
00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:45.800
Don't drag Lan Lan down

35
00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:52.766
When I married Lan Lan

36
00:01:52.766 --> 00:01:54.266
Your family is in deep debt

37
00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:55.766
I helped you get through this difficult time

38
00:01:55.766 --> 00:01:58.700
Why do you want to kick me away now that you are rich?

39
00:02:02.466 --> 00:02:04.600
You still have the face to say rich

40
00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.466
Does it have anything to do with you?

41
00:02:06.466 --> 00:02:09.500
All these years you have eaten and drank freely in our house

42
00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.266
You know how to fish all day

43
00:02:11.266 --> 00:02:14.800
Oh, you live a life more moist than a fairy

44
00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.100
What did you do for him?

45
00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.800
Our Gao family can have today's life

46
00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.000
It's all up to Lan Lan to work hard

47
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.900
Why are you so embarrassed to stay by his side?

48
00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.533
Since I can make you rich

49
00:02:25.533 --> 00:02:27.233
I can get it back anytime
