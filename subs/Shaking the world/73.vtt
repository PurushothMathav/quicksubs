00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:04.200
How is that possible?

2
00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:09.366
Brothers even beat this level

3
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.800
No one else can

4
00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:13.233
You're so young.

5
00:00:13.533 --> 00:00:15.100
How could it be?

6

To see

13
00:00:42.266 --> 00:00:43.800
Mom, are you alright?

14
00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.500
Wenjie, I'm fine

15
00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:47.300
If I believe you to save me

16
00:00:58.733 --> 00:00:59.533
Come on.

17
00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:14.766
You two are face dumplings.

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:15.700
A boring
