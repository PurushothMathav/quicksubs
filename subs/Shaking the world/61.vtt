00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.500
Hahahaha

2
00:00:06.966 --> 00:00:10.066
How about pretending to be different?

3
00:00:10.266 --> 00:00:12.400
Hahaha fill the fat man with your face

4
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.200
Don't pretend if you don't have that strength.

5
00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:15.966
How is it? Does your face hurt?

6
00:00:15.966 --> 00:00:17.566
Huh? What's going on?

7
00:00:17.666 --> 00:00:19.833
There are obviously hundreds of billions in this card

8
00:00:20.366 --> 00:00:21.700
It's still here.

9
00:00:22.266 --> 00:00:25.966
Do you think hundreds of billions are ghost coins? Xu Wenjie

10
00:00:27.933 --> 00:00:28.766
Why don't you hurry up?

11
00:00:28.766 --> 00:00:30.133
Financial fraud is a felony

12
00:00:30.133 --> 00:00:31.433
I won't kill you again and again

13
00:00:31.466 --> 00:00:32.666
Sorry, sorry.

14
00:00:32.666 --> 00:00:33.733
It's because of me

15
00:00:33.733 --> 00:00:34.800
I don't have enough authority.

16
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:35.900
I'll go to the manager.

17
00:00:37.733 --> 00:00:40.800
The manager has a gentleman who wants to buy Villa 001

18
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:41.666
What!

19
00:00:42.766 --> 00:00:43.966
If this order is successful

20
00:00:43.966 --> 00:00:45.566
I'll give you 1,000 yuan

21
00:00:46.533 --> 00:00:48.766
This list is obviously his own

22
00:00:48.766 --> 00:00:50.666
Could have 200,000 commission

23
00:00:50.733 --> 00:00:52.833
The manager wants to spread the commission.

24
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.700
Yeah, it's hard to find you

25
00:00:58.266 --> 00:00:59.733
He is so poor

26
00:00:59.733 --> 00:01:01.900
How could you possibly afford such an expensive villa?

27
00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:03.600
Make Lao Tzu happy

28
00:01:03.966 --> 00:01:07.800
We can't judge people by their appearance, and we dare to be stubborn?

29
00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:10.633
What if I could afford it?

30
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.766
What if you could afford it?

31
00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.466
I kneel down and call you father three times

32
00:01:15.933 --> 00:01:16.900
That's so great!

33
00:01:17.966 --> 00:01:19.266
Credit.
