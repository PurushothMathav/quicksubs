00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:03.866
Master Xu's provincial capital, Zhao Xia, is now leaderless

2
00:00:03.866 --> 00:00:04.966
Infighting evil crowd

3
00:00:05.266 --> 00:00:07.633
Would you consider intervening?

4
00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:10.200
Then you can figure it out.

5
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.633
How do the people of the Zhao family handle Zhao Jing?

6
00:00:17.766 --> 00:00:19.566
Find out what they did.

7
00:00:19.933 --> 00:00:22.666
There is no one to kill

8
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.500
Yeah.

9
00:00:24.766 --> 00:00:26.233
In addition, Master Xu

10
00:00:26.266 --> 00:00:29.000
Have you considered buying a property?

11
00:00:29.166 --> 00:00:31.500
I'm used to drinking salted fish

12
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.700
Besides, I love dimples

13
00:00:34.866 --> 00:00:35.800
hum

14
00:00:36.566 --> 00:00:40.566
But the young master should also think about your mother

15
00:00:40.966 --> 00:00:43.066
There are already two dragon heart grass.

16
00:00:43.066 --> 00:00:45.300
The other one also knows the lower fruit

17
00:00:45.666 --> 00:00:47.300
Madam returns to the world

18
00:00:47.366 --> 00:00:48.433
Who is the most replaceable?

19
00:00:48.566 --> 00:00:49.800
That's true.

20
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.033
Tingting gave me a Supreme Blue Dragon Card before

21
00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.200
By the way, what is the best real estate in Yuncheng?

22
00:00:57.766 --> 00:00:59.000
Wanliu Academy

23
00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:05.733
Hello, sir.

24
00:01:05.733 --> 00:01:07.733
Excuse me, do you want to see the house?

25
00:01:07.733 --> 00:01:10.633
That's right. What's the best house you have?

26
00:01:11.133 --> 00:01:12.666
Xu Wenjie

27
00:01:14.466 --> 00:01:17.466
You trash are really haunting

28
00:01:17.766 --> 00:01:21.300
This Wanliu Academy is also a place where you can enter

29
00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:24.466
Why can't this community even watch a dog?

30
00:01:24.466 --> 00:01:27.066
His uncle wants to buy the best house here

31
00:01:27.066 --> 00:01:29.600
Hmm, you have to pay attention

32
00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.766
He just wanted to sneak into your showroom and steal something

33
00:01:33.366 --> 00:01:34.566
You'd better go quickly

34
00:01:34.566 --> 00:01:36.533
Few people know now that we are divorced.

35
00:01:36.533 --> 00:01:37.800
If it gets out

36
00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.500
We lost the face of our Gao family

37
00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.600
If I'm bored, I'll buy the whole neighborhood

38
00:01:43.733 --> 00:01:45.566
That's just old wishful thinking

39
00:01:47.366 --> 00:01:48.466
Keep introducing me

40
00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:50.433
Ah, yes, sir.

41
00:01:51.266 --> 00:01:53.533
This is a self-contained villa

42
00:01:53.533 --> 00:01:55.300
Total area 2,000 square meters

43
00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:56.933
Construction area of 700 square meters

44
00:01:56.933 --> 00:01:59.666
Look at the top three floors and the bottom two floors.

45
00:01:59.666 --> 00:02:01.266
And it has courtyards in the front and rear.

46
00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:03.600
Yeah, and it has its own swimming pool.

47
00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.066
And golf courses.

48
00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.800
There is a separate garage at the bottom.

49
00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:10.433
It's good to be able to park 10 cars

50
00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:12.433
Just this time

51
00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:14.966
Look at when you will pay

52
00:02:14.966 --> 00:02:16.966
See if you can still pretend

53
00:02:17.066 --> 00:02:18.933
This villa costs 1 billion

54
00:02:18.933 --> 00:02:21.433
You can't afford to sell yourself.

55
00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.000
Summer worms are not compatible with ice

56
00:02:26.733 --> 00:02:27.633
Credit.
