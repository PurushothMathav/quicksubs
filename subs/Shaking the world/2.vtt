00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:04.466
If your brain is broken, you don't pee. Take a photo

2
00:00:04.466 --> 00:00:06.066
What am I?

3
00:00:06.066 --> 00:00:07.766
How dare you brag here

4
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.766
This slap is to clear your mind

5
00:00:11.766 --> 00:00:12.566
you

6
00:00:16.066 --> 00:00:16.866
Lan Lan

7
00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:18.100
Your mom is crazy

8
00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:19.533
He insisted on forcing us to divorce

9
00:00:19.533 --> 00:00:22.266
What did I write about the divorce agreement?

10
00:00:22.266 --> 00:00:24.266
Today is our wedding anniversary

11
00:00:24.266 --> 00:00:25.500
Why would you do that?

12
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:26.400
Why is that?

13
00:00:27.166 --> 00:00:28.666
My father died early

14
00:00:28.666 --> 00:00:29.966
Small family decline

15
00:00:30.566 --> 00:00:33.266
I married you at the behest of my grandfather

16
00:00:33.266 --> 00:00:35.366
You only got 800,000 dowry

17
00:00:35.466 --> 00:00:37.833
From then on, I have been in Yongcheng City step by step

18
00:00:37.933 --> 00:00:39.400
Fight for tens of billions of family assets

19
00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.700
Yesterday I was sponsored by 200 million

20
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.400
Got Shen Wansan's charity dinner request letter

21
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:45.933
The future is limitless

22
00:00:45.933 --> 00:00:47.500
The so-called tiger and half dog type

23
00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.600
You and I are no longer from the same world

24
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:50.600
Isn't it just with Shen?

25
00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.666
Did that old man have a meal?

26
00:00:52.666 --> 00:00:54.100
Just picked you up like this

27
00:00:54.933 --> 00:00:55.733
shut up

28
00:00:56.333 --> 00:00:58.533
Shen Wansan is the richest man in Yuncheng

29
00:00:58.533 --> 00:01:00.533
You trash who knows how to fish all day

30
00:01:00.533 --> 00:01:03.266
How dare you call him an old man and auntie?

31
00:01:03.266 --> 00:01:05.800
Forget it, he idles around all day

32
00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:06.866
Naturally I don't know Shen

33
00:01:06.866 --> 00:01:08.700
What is the status of Wan San in our Yuncheng?

34
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.333
Even less likely to know what a charity dinner means

35
00:01:11.333 --> 00:01:13.400
We don't need to say anything to him

36
00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.066
I'll take 80 million as compensation

37
00:01:15.466 --> 00:01:17.100
100 times your bride price

38
00:01:20.066 --> 00:01:21.066
This marriage

39
00:01:23.166 --> 00:01:24.433
I'm leaving

40
00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.233
Looks like you've made up your mind, right?

41
00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.900
You and I have been in a relationship for three years since then

42
00:01:38.666 --> 00:01:39.466
grievances

43
00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.133
Well, you can take this money and have a lifetime of worry-free

44
00:01:44.133 --> 00:01:46.200
I don't owe you anything when I'm tall

45
00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.933
You return my mother's jade pendant to me

46
00:01:47.933 --> 00:01:50.466
That was left by our Xu family to our daughter-in-law

47
00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:52.700
give

48
00:01:58.666 --> 00:01:59.400
I forgot to mention that.

49
00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.900
I had prepared a wedding anniversary gift

50
00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:03.666
Examine the group's 100 billion contracts

51
00:02:03.666 --> 00:02:05.300
Since you are all blind

52
00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:06.433
Then forget it.

53
00:02:07.966 --> 00:02:09.366
100 billion contract
