00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:01.766
How come?

2
00:00:02.533 --> 00:00:05.300
Boy, what kind of drug dealer are you using with him?

3
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:06.966
What exactly did you use?

4
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:10.466
Jiuxiang Talk Poison Powder

5
00:00:10.733 --> 00:00:11.766
Never heard of it

6
00:00:12.266 --> 00:00:15.100
What wine incense talk poison powder

7
00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.366
This is obviously the secret recipe of my Fan family

8
00:00:17.366 --> 00:00:18.300
How can you have

9
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.633
Did you steal it?

10
00:00:21.533 --> 00:00:23.966
So you are the grandson of Old Man Fan's family?

11
00:00:24.166 --> 00:00:25.966
I gave you your secret recipe

12
00:00:25.966 --> 00:00:27.700
Cut fart

13
00:00:27.966 --> 00:00:29.366
What secret recipe did you give?

14
00:00:29.366 --> 00:00:30.666
That's obviously my grandfather

15
00:00:30.666 --> 00:00:32.466
Research lifetime recipes

16
00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:34.600
How could it be from you?

17
00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.000
You must have stolen it.

18
00:00:36.133 --> 00:00:38.100
Could it be that the one you mentioned is

19
00:00:38.166 --> 00:00:41.500
The head doctor of the country who paid as much as 10 million for a visit fell ill

20
00:00:41.766 --> 00:00:44.033
Yes, that's right

21
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:45.933
He'll be here soon.

22
00:00:45.933 --> 00:00:47.366
I'll see how stubborn you are in a while

23
00:00:48.333 --> 00:00:49.133
Xu Wenjie

24
00:00:49.133 --> 00:00:50.900
How can you steal someone else's recipe?

25
00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.166
That's the No. 1 shooter in Silver City

26
00:00:53.166 --> 00:00:54.500
He also said that the secret recipe was given by you

27
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:55.466
You're a liar

28
00:00:55.466 --> 00:00:56.566
Apologize now

29
00:00:56.566 --> 00:00:58.866
The genius doctor will come in a while, and I won't be able to end it.

30
00:00:59.100 --> 00:00:59.800
Sorry.

31
00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.433
I see he's here, I'm afraid he has to apologize to me

32
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.300
Are you still being stubborn about your poor self-esteem?

33
00:01:07.166 --> 00:01:08.300
I don't care about you.

34
00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.700
Only someone else begged my grandfather for a copy

35
00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.400
You will see later

36
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.500
Why is he on his knees talking to me?

37
00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.066
That Yamano Muraichi

38
00:01:19.333 --> 00:01:21.466
Let me kneel
