00:00:00.766 --> 00:00:01.600
What a son-in-law

2
00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:03.500
Mom was confused for a while

3
00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:06.100
Don't you have the same knowledge as mom?

4
00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:08.566
Brother-in-law, you hit me well before

5
00:00:08.566 --> 00:00:09.966
It woke me up.

6
00:00:09.966 --> 00:00:11.366
I will definitely work hard in the future

7
00:00:11.366 --> 00:00:12.566
Be your good helper

8
00:00:12.566 --> 00:00:15.400
Wenjie, I misunderstood you before.

9
00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:16.500
It's all my fault

10
00:00:16.966 --> 00:00:18.333
I want to remarry you

11
00:00:18.333 --> 00:00:19.466
I don't agree with that.

12
00:00:19.666 --> 00:00:21.966
Your Gao family treated Mr. Xu like this before

13
00:00:21.966 --> 00:00:23.566
I still want to remarry

14
00:00:23.666 --> 00:00:24.900
Even if you want to get married

15
00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.100
That person is also mature

16
00:00:26.533 --> 00:00:28.666
What's up?

17
00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:30.366
You were blind before

18
00:00:30.533 --> 00:00:32.566
It doesn't deserve a truth like Wen Jie at all

19
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.600
Mr. Xu, I have brought my account book today

20
00:00:41.733 --> 00:00:43.066
You can get the certificate today.

21
00:00:44.733 --> 00:00:46.400
I also brought the account book

22
00:00:51.066 --> 00:00:52.566
Kids make choices.

23
00:00:52.766 --> 00:00:53.800
two

24
00:00:54.733 --> 00:00:56.966
You have to stop

25
00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.166
So vulgar

26
00:00:59.166 --> 00:01:01.100
How can I deserve the responsibility of my unicorn?

27
00:01:01.366 --> 00:01:02.333
Who are you?

28
00:01:02.333 --> 00:01:04.100
Why do you say we are the grave of mediocrity?

29
00:01:04.133 --> 00:01:05.400
Do you know who I am?

30
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.866
How dare you speak to me like that?

31
00:01:06.866 --> 00:01:10.400
Mom, don't get involved in my own business

32
00:01:10.466 --> 00:01:12.666
What? He's your mom?
