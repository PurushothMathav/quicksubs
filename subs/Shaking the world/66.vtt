00:00:00.533 --> 00:00:01.200
Welcome.

2
00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:02.966
What kind of car do you want to see?

3
00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:05.066
It is said that college students pet

4
00:00:05.066 --> 00:00:06.500
Sure enough, it's a pet

5
00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:08.200
This place is full of luxury cars

6
00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:09.800
Hundreds of thousands of millions of units

7
00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:11.400
How could they possibly afford that?

8
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.733
Are you crazy to want to make money?

9
00:00:13.733 --> 00:00:15.966
Do you think the commission is so easy to get?

10
00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:18.200
As long as he enters our store

11
00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:19.400
It's our customer.

12
00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.200
Attracting customers is our responsibility

13
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:22.400
I'm dying of laughter.

14
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:23.866
College students are really qualified

15
00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:25.700
It's responsibility to open your mouth and shut up

16
00:00:26.533 --> 00:00:27.900
You don't have to pay attention to them.

17
00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.400
What kind of car do you want to see? I can introduce it to you.

18
00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:31.700
You two can also test drive

19
00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:34.300
Then take a look at that one

20
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:35.900
OK

21
00:00:37.333 --> 00:00:38.933
That's nearly 40 million dollars in luxury cars.

22
00:00:38.933 --> 00:00:40.300
I can't even sell you.

23
00:00:40.533 --> 00:00:41.800
You are a micro business

24
00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.000
We've all seen a lot.

25
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.466
Come and take a picture.

26
00:00:44.466 --> 00:00:45.800
Then go out and find someone

27
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.400
College students, you have to be careful

28
00:00:47.466 --> 00:00:49.366
They wrecked the car, you pay

29
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.566
Are you a college student with shit in your brain?

30
00:00:54.266 --> 00:00:55.933
Anyone dares

31
00:00:55.933 --> 00:00:56.733
Wang Jindai

32
00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:58.633
You're fired.

33
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.466
Boss, can I get my salary back?

34
00:01:01.466 --> 00:01:02.566
Want salary

35
00:01:02.933 --> 00:01:05.100
All fired

36
00:01:07.866 --> 00:01:09.300
scrap this set bro

37
00:01:11.766 --> 00:01:12.600
how

38
00:01:13.133 --> 00:01:13.933
Still want to hit someone

39
00:01:13.933 --> 00:01:15.500
I don't just hit people

40
00:01:15.566 --> 00:01:17.066
I also want you to close the store.
