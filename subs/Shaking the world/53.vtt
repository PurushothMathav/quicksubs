00:00:01.066 --> 00:00:02.500
Ignorant descendants

2
00:00:02.533 --> 00:00:04.900
You are not afraid that the wind will flash your tongue

3
00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:06.200
Our two large pools

4
00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:09.166
Peak kills you more than enough to take it down

5
00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.400
Looks like I have another situation today

6
00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.700
Garbage dares to be stubborn when it is about to die

7
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:28.566
What's going on here?

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:29.866
What did you do?

9
00:00:29.866 --> 00:00:31.166
Soon to know

10
00:00:35.466 --> 00:00:36.800

11
00:00:37.066 --> 00:00:39.900
This is the long-lost Rain Plum Needle
