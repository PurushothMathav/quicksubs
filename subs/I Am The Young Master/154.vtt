00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:02.360
This general's character has some flaws.

2
00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:04.210
He doesn't know how to win my heart.

3
00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:06.610
Luo Hai and the Huangwei gang had long wanted to touch him.

4
00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:08.450
He does not lead to the core full head,

5
00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:10.070
Then they unite to return to his palace.

6
00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:12.310
In the end, General Tiansu and Shuangquannan were born for the first time.

7
00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:14.070
But he ended up like this,

8
00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.490
You care about it. Can't bear to see if this is still the case.

9
00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:20.020
You can rest assured here. I must be able to.

10
00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:22.070
Want something else. This thing is awesome.

11
00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.340
What now. Dongxicai Tuan,

12
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.180
You are very important in Jiang Ruo's affairs.

13
00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.860
But this time after the red,

14
00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:30.680
All dragons have no hands, three generations of four and five months,

15
00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.110
Master. You don't mean to. That's right

16
00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:41.360
I want to integrate things and hide them next to each other. How about this young master?

17
00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:45.840
Just leave this matter to me.

18
00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:49.060
This is President Fu. Young Master Fu is here.

19
00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:51.190
The company's business has been busy recently

20
00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:52.290
first meeting

21
00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:54.290
Integrating the Eastern and Western Groups

22
00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.060
Just leave it to me

23
00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.850
That's okay, the Yang is obvious

24
00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:04.349
This Fufu president

25
00:01:04.349 --> 00:01:05.690
Have you always been like this?

26
00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:08.170
What about her character?

27
00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:09.150
Really helpless

28
00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.330
And he doesnâ€™t really like others to defeat him.

29
00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.060
Father-in-law, father-in-law, we are all to blame

30
00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:37.880
So fast, so fast, so fast, yeah

31
00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:38.620
I am also a traitor

32
00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:42.640
but good thing

33
00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:48.210
Who is he trying to say?
