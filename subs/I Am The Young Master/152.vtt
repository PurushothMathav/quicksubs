1
00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:06.260
What's the bias?

2
00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:08.460
Master Wan, the situation is not optimistic,

3
00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:10.620
Ms. Jiang's head was severely injured.

4
00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:12.880
What can I do to transfer it in? OK.

5
00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:19.280
That's okay, that's it.

6
00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:21.240
Ms. Jiangâ€™s situation, a bicycle book,

7
00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:23.060
may be be be.

8
00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:24.820
What? Then find a way,

9
00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:26.860
I don't think so, for father and son.

10
00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:28.420
There is a way, but,

11
00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:30.840
You can do whatever you want.

12
00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.479
Okay, it's like this,

13
00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:35.360
I should tell you, do you know? If he is willing to come up with a solution,

14
00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:37.120
There may be a transfer, you may not know.

15
00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:39.780
Ding Wenxiu, right?

16
00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:40.860
See it on my TV

17
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.400
I heard about his migration

18
00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:44.540
In the whole situation, it could be my fault

19
00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:45.290
Dingwen

20
00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:46.490
Live in Jiangzhou now

21
00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:48.390
It's just that he has already said it

22
00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:50.990
From now on, it will be fine if I watch TV and behave like a human being.

23
00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.870
I'll find a way. Thank you. Okay, right away.

24
00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:57.810
Say Ding Wen

25
00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:58.930
Bring me the information. Thank you.
