00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:03.520
Isn’t this Wan Jiaqi, the soft-hearted person? It’s you again

2
00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:04.720
What else do I want to ask you?

3
00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:06.740
Today is Wan Jiaqi

4
00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:08.260
A great conference

5
00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:10.360
The business community gathers in the northern part of Taishan

6
00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:12.380
It’s hard to be a weak person

7
00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:14.520
Is this where you can buy?

8
00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:15.560
Isn't it?

9
00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:16.180
Say who?

10
00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:17.280
I'm talking about you

11
00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:18.930
I can listen to what you say about beef tendon

12
00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:22.290
I heard that you photographed a woman who is a prodigy in the industry.

13
00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:23.730
Still a baby girl

14
00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:25.460
There's no such thing

15
00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:26.440
You mean mutton tendons?

16
00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:27.760
It seems like this is really happening

17
00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:30.270
Unexpectedly, Wan Jiaqi

18
00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:32.030
You have hands and feet

19
00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:33.130
Still dominate women

20
00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.000
What a shame for us men

21
00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:37.720
I thought you really showed up

22
00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:39.060
It turns out they are all ladies

23
00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.020
Because last year I wanted to tune, tune, tune,

24
00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:44.820
You don't even know where you've gone since then

25
00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:48.920
Last time I told you to let go of the dog but not let it go

26
00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:50.860
So self-conscious

27
00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.240
You take it as a wonderful thing for so many people, so I have to write urgently.

28
00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:55.220
Not very good

29
00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:58.060
A man who is really capable, last time he cut a knife

30
00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:59.390
Throw it away and cut it

31
00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:00.820
It was all because of you last time

32
00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:03.220
We will drive you in the morning

33
00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.180
I still have self-respect

34
00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:08.740
Can you two survive?
