1
00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:02.340
How about it? You'll be sorry, right?

2
00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:04.680
Right? I don’t know if there will be another conference in two days.

3
00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:07.760
After hugging me, I want everyone to announce your identity.

4
00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:15.920
I'll do it for you, okay?

5
00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:21.080
Even if I haven’t eaten your food for many years, go and do it yourself.

6
00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:22.020
I haven’t eaten your food for many years

7
00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:29.640
Come on, take the lead, okay, okay, this guy.

8
00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:32.340
This is the girl sent by Jiangzhou Express

9
00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:35.170
They heard that our boy Jiangzhou opened a road

10
00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:37.270
All boys set fire to Jiangzhou Huaxiu

11
00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:38.290
It's not necessary

12
00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:39.790
I also played and ate it

13
00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:46.390
This Kusama is after the third year of high school

14
00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:47.290
first layer layer by layer

15
00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:48.770
After the strength of the activity base

16
00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:50.150
I still want to dance as compensation

17
00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:52.750
I think they're trying to get started with us.

18
00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:53.810
What we should say

19
00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:55.500
Absolutely okay

20
00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.920
Let’s talk about the activities later, Xiaoyue.

21
00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:03.980
what are you doing

22
00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:07.120
We're leaving this thing

23
00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:08.460
always open

24
00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:11.510
This is a gift from the professor's good friends

25
00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:13.210
The one in your hand

26
00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:14.190
I remember to

27
00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:16.530
Hu Sai Ye Hu Red Light Industry Bar

28
00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:17.270
Big soft driving

29
00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:18.430
More than five million

30
00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:23.360
So much of this thing

31
00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:24.880
What should I do?

32
00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.400
If you like, go and hold it.

33
00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:28.320
Are you still tidying up?

34
00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.550
So be it

35
00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:30.290
Let's go first

36
00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:38.680
Let's send it off first

37
00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:40.220
I'm sure you'll be happy to death
