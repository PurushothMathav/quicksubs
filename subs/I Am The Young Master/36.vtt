00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:06.850
It is my great joy to welcome everyone today and thank you all for coming to analyze our wedding here,

2
00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.710
Don't thank me. You are the Group's Li Zong Wang and the Group's Li Zong Wang Jiaqi.

3
00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:12.420
Aren't you going to give an explanation?

4
00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.000
I also asked Jiaqi, is this not my wife’s explanation?

5
00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:16.620
Surely it has something to do with it?

6
00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:17.740
How am I doing with him?

7
00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.660
It's okay to drink some. It's early.

8
00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:20.660
It's okay with him

9
00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:21.860
If you dare, you have to have a strong rhythm

10
00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:23.430
It's because the front is stronger

11
00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.230
This rhythm is also disturbed by the front foot.

12
00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:26.170
You are a dog

13
00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:28.310
I just give people the legal hat on my back.

14
00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:29.570
If only he knew

15
00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:31.960
You are afraid that there are stones on the road.

16
00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:33.800
how to speak

17
00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:35.260
You saw it yourselves

18
00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:36.560
He also scanned me

19
00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:37.540
Did I hear it right?

20
00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:39.160
Wanjiajia big night

21
00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:40.940
Wan Shao is also a famous businessman

22
00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:44.600
You're a piece of trash who can't even find a job.

23
00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:45.520
they take you

24
00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:47.040
He is also blind

25
00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.030
That real farmer came out with a person

26
00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:50.590
If this woman can handle it

27
00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:52.300
I'll give you iron shoes if I lose money

28
00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:53.040
Said it myself

29
00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:54.400
So what if I said it?

30
00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:55.770
I warn you

31
00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:57.350
Don't you dare to say a few words again

32
00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:59.070
Don't say they're married

33
00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:02.220
Even we can't let you, right?

34
00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.030
First time in my heart

35
00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:06.670
I go deep into a girl's

36
00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:08.910
Your heart wants to trade

37
00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:10.250
Your little bit

38
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:13.840
Are you deeply in love so much? I love you

39
00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:15.740
I am willing to take care of you all my life

40
00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:21.920
will you marry me

41
00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:27.410
You marry me, marry me, marry me, marry me, marry him.

42
00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:35.470
If you don’t marry him, marry him, marry him if you want.
