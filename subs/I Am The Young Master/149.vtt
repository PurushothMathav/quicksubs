00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.300
Something happened to Dongxi Ginseng? What happened?

2
00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:05.480
After the East-West ginseng incident occurred, we are now reviewing the code,

3
00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.600
President Jian Tiansu has now been reborn,

4
00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:08.840
Just say it’s due.

5
00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:10.100
That's true. Is he okay?

6
00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:12.680
This situation now probably reminds me of human feelings.

7
00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:14.260
Then why are you waiting to save him?

8
00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.840
Wang Wei, I won't help you, but you dare to betray me.

9
00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:26.380
Speaking of Tiansu, I can't help it, it all means upward.

10
00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:28.570
What exactly does Grassland He want to do?

11
00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:37.040
However, you have been used to it by the police, so you have to make some guarantees.

12
00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.260
Good Yuanhe, how dare you because of me,

13
00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:43.300
You tricked me into going to the nuclear strike dock,

14
00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:45.860
Then he attacked from behind with this trick

15
00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:48.210
So what?

16
00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:50.430
You promised to marry Jiang Shi to Busy

17
00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:52.820
Then I changed my hands and used it to explore what the problem was.

18
00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:55.900
Damn it, you're a piece of trash like this.

19
00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:00.120
Did you hear it?

20
00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:02.680
Who is the first person to mention that people are cultivating?

21
00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:04.060
Sorry Jiang Shi

22
00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:05.519
You're a bastard

23
00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:06.740
If it weren't for weakness, it wouldn't be there

24
00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:08.580
It’s hard for you to have a chance to look at me at this moment

25
00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:12.180
I'm sorry, miss.

26
00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.740
I'm afraid I'm going to disappoint you Haige

27
00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:17.280
It's been a while with us already
