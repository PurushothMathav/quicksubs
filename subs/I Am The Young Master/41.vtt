00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.700
In this industry, my wife became the boss behind the scenes,

2
00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:08.890
Do you still have to live your own life? Sixteen homes,

3
00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:10.370
Why not?

4
00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.890
What kind of bullshit are you doing? In my face,

5
00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.120
He can only eat cats?

6
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.000
Don't let me die in such a big way,

7
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.140
Why didn't you come all the way? I hope you will be happy,

8
00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:24.960
People within the case,

9
00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:27.220
Give him a drink as a gift, no need,

10
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.430
It’s not necessary, it’s healthy,

11
00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:32.250
I'm no longer worthy of it. I don't want it anymore.

12
00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:34.880
You come and these dogs come,

13
00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:35.560
Leave it to you,

14
00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:36.240
You say these

15
00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.640
Rhythm Mao came here to celebrate today

16
00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:43.120
You actually let Mao celebrate right away.

17
00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:44.930
You haven't gone yet

18
00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:47.290
What do you mean?

19
00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:48.570
wish me personally

20
00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:50.570
Now I have to run alone

21
00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:51.780
I just want to know

22
00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:53.900
He follows the rhythm everywhere

23
00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:56.600
I have to do it like this Mr. Xiong

24
00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.900
Celebrating many festivals, this celebration is coming soon

25
00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:00.820
I've been out for a long time

26
00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:03.500
It also has an extra rhythmic aspect to it

27
00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:07.380
I gave you one called Fetch

28
00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.370
Do you have any questions about the books here?
