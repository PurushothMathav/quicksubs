00:00:01.210 --> 00:00:04.270
Why is it you again? No questions asked, nothing to talk about? Is it you?

2
00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:08.150
You kid is like a dog's house iron

3
00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:09.490
Let my circle be the boss

4
00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:11.010
It's your car that's better than mine

5
00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:12.710
There are also women and I don’t care.

6
00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:13.450
I tell you

7
00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:14.710
My little silver

8
00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:16.850
When you bought your child, it cost more than 20 million

9
00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:18.610
Either 10,000 or 20,000

10
00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:19.970
You bought me the car

11
00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.760
Either one, two, ten thousand, ten thousand or ten thousand people will give it to me, right?

12
00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:24.290
separated by seven

13
00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:26.050
You deducted 50 million from me

14
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:27.680
I'm so sorry.

15
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:29.860
Why do you want me to make a bet?

16
00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:32.680
Come on, I don't care

17
00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:33.780
You didn't even give me seven divisions

18
00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:34.560
That kid moves

19
00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:35.020
I've already deducted it

20
00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:35.960
I've been cheated

21
00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:37.120
Think I'm stupid

22
00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:38.540
Ah, looking for flowers on the back

23
00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:40.400
I'll bother you first

24
00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:42.240
I won’t give it. I won’t give it.

25
00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:43.700
If they don't give it to me, they will die.

26
00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:58.220
Young Master, I am from the National Taiwan University. Why don't you lay off your employees?

27
00:00:58.460 --> 00:00:59.260
I'm right

28
00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:00.570
I'm on my way

29
00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:01.390
This has to be abandoned

30
00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:03.000
Come and go

31
00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:06.350
Harm them Yang'er people, right?

32
00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:07.210
not tell you

33
00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:08.470
No one came

34
00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:10.830
Today, hurry up and give me the money and take it with you

35
00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.370
If you want me, I'll break your hook

36
00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.060
Who is going to break our last leg?
