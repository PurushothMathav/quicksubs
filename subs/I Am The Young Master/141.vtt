00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.490
Please exercise for a few days. Just like what happened?

2
00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:03.490
Just like what happened?

3
00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:05.660
Usually when I am in my fifth term, I invite my old classmates to

4
00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:08.280
I'll find a chance to say goodbye.

5
00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.350
Let me understand, it’s me, I am Wanyue,

6
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.120
This month, I really found you.

7
00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:18.510
Long time no see, what have we been busy with lately?

8
00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:21.540
I'm not busy. Why are you looking for me with more than three thousand dollars?

9
00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.780
That's right, I have a chance to meet my classmates tonight,

10
00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:26.200
Don't you think you can come over?

11
00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.320
Forget it, I have something else to do.

12
00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:30.470
How do I feel about this opportunity? If you don’t come,

13
00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:32.430
Isn't that a little too disrespectful of you?

14
00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:35.340
I'll send you the address, come over, that's it.

15
00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.210
Do you want to find someone to review multiple times?

16
00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:42.090
It's okay. They're all old classmates.

17
00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:43.880
That piece is the last part

18
00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:45.780
That's how they are

19
00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:52.620
Call the police. Come on, the defoaming guy.
