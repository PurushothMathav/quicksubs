00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:03.390
This is the effect,

2
00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:05.750
A way to be able to move while you are speaking.

3
00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:07.890
Mr. Yang, what does that mean?

4
00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.700
Can you call me?

5
00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:13.120
Then I called him over, why didn't you,

6
00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:15.050
Okay? If you call me over,

7
00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:19.130
Why not, then I want you to quit Huaxing International,

8
00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:20.990
They were all deeply disappointed,

9
00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:23.390
They are from Huaxing International and we cannot afford to let them go.

10
00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:26.740
How many people are there now, but let me tell you,

11
00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.880
That fair company of yours, and back then,

12
00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:32.520
Take it, what does this say come from?

13
00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:37.160
I love you, whatever. I am here,

14
00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:38.060
Qin Meng Na Hotel

15
00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:38.770
You don't come over

16
00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:39.350
You don't come over

17
00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.530
You don't come over

18
00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:41.410
Then try to think of a way, but you still can’t play a few roles

19
00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:43.580
If you can't let go, we will all go.

20
00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:44.740
You are not Qin Mengna Hotel

21
00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:47.000
What I meant

22
00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.260
What's wrong with you?

23
00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:49.700
What's going on?

24
00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:52.300
You don’t even know how to die

25
00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:55.420
Today's matter is handled by him at the official meeting

26
00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:00.240
Thousands of people are dead and the Internet is back

27
00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:01.830
I count them one by one

28
00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:03.790
No one can run away today
