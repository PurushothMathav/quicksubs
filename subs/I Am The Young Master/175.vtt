00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:02.180
Secretary General of Yangxing Shengwen,

2
00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:04.480
We have our company’s machine date documents,

3
00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:11.610
not just just just just just just just

4
00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.450
Just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just, just

5
00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:34.480
Just

6
00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.650
What about the process of our business war?

7
00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:40.050
It has collapsed. Now what?

8
00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:42.740
No longer exists. Keep a secretary.

9
00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:45.510
You're not sitting there, are you?

10
00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:46.720
No, young master

11
00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:48.580
Do you believe that I am not like this?

12
00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:50.210
As far as I know

13
00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:52.650
Raising a secretary at the Mingniu Conference

14
00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:55.110
Specially nominated the deputy son of the Tao family

15
00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.710
Cooperate with us

16
00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:59.670
And the Tao family’s deputy is also on the right track

17
00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:02.550
It’s said that this is influenced by your ruler

18
00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.610
You can't admit it

19
00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:06.110
What about your Mingniu Conference?

20
00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:07.590
I don’t have any selfish motives from the Communist Party

21
00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:09.770
I know that I consider the overall situation, young master.

22
00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:11.190
Calmness suits me

23
00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:13.690
Then why have I heard about it?

24
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.920
The one who was against the young master

25
00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:17.260
PR does not care about managers

26
00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.160
You single-handedly promoted it?

27
00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.720
Only those who meet

28
00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.800
What do you mean

29
00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:23.300
You deliberately unlimited the Internet young master

30
00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:25.790
Things are not simple this time

31
00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:29.840
Must be extended otherwise

32
00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.600
The consequences are beyond imagination

33
00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:38.940
Maybe we have to do this or that

34
00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:42.550
I feel aggrieved and need a secretary. Someone come here.

35
00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:45.690
I want you to catch me and shoot your teeth first
