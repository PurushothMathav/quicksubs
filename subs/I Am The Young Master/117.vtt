00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.200
If you can't leave, what are you doing?

2
00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:03.940
God, you come to the government.

3
00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:05.920
There is a smelly yellow foot full of beards here.

4
00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:07.840
The fork contained the medicine that the emperor would later write down.

5
00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:10.820
If I plan to help you catch him, the emperor will leave you alone in the future.

6
00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:13.160
Isn't that a place where normal people can go?

7
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.620
Whether you are satisfied or not, you are, whether you are satisfied or not, you are.

8
00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:17.400
Not bad, not bad.

9
00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:21.860
If something happens to my family, my family will rise. If my family rises, it will be me who cannot do it.

10
00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.300
Are you still here with your bare legs full of raw materials?

11
00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.220
If you don't mean it, I'll beat you to death. Don't even see Goudanzi.

12
00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:28.040
Fill up your feet.

13
00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:31.830
I am informing you now that you have been fired,

14
00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.790
Future, are you mistaken?

15
00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:36.750
Don't lose the race in one mile. He will catch up in one mile.

16
00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.550
did you make a mistake

17
00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:40.110
Why should he make a mistake?

18
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:42.560
Whose is he to you?

19
00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:43.740
If you don't dare, you will blame him

20
00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:44.920
Doesn't mean I'm not sorry

21
00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:47.680
I don't care about you here. Change it quickly.

22
00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:51.720
No one wants to give him money

23
00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:53.240
There is also a small chess game

24
00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:55.320
You will wait for us to leave

25
00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:00.750
You can go right away, it's okay

26
00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:01.730
thank you sir

27
00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:06.060
Thank you, I'll give you the money in exchange for this

28
00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.670
What the hell is going on?

29
00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.250
President of Huaxing Chamber of Commerce

30
00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:11.530
Just call the first deputy

31
00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:12.750
you say we

32
00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:15.290
Have you heard, heard, heard

33
00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:16.390
You, the president

34
00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:17.850
Came to Jiangzhou

35
00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.170
The entire Shangshang community was moved.

36
00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:24.500
I don’t see you. I don’t know if you’ll be together for a long time. You’ll also be happy to accompany me.

37
00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.000
Ah Lao didn't say anything

38
00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.650
Let's talk about it in the evening
