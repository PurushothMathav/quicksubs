00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:11.400
I only want to marry my daughter to you because I am not going against them.

2
00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:27.750
I gave my daughter to me and killed so many people.

3
00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:30.800
Well, it’s obvious what do you do?

4
00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:34.100
It’s you, thank you, our lady.

5
00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.640
Who is it? I call me Hai,

6
00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:42.120
Have you ever heard of the name Dongxin Consortium?

7
00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.940
This first place was all taken by us.

8
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.790
It's great that they came out, these little actors are very good.

9
00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:55.200
How could I hear this video being put here with you?

10
00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:56.490
Put it here

11
00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:00.280
You fart, our lady

12
00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.900
Is it possible for such a person to become wealthy?

13
00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:06.140
Do you still want to encourage our family to be smaller?

14
00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.940
Believe it or not, I will answer everyone I call.

15
00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.960
What happened now?

16
00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:20.580
There’s also a point about my husband who couldn’t get on the stage before.

17
00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.040
Dare to make such a cry

18
00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:25.180
You are Mr. Gao

19
00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:28.320
Young Master is mine

20
00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:31.550
I heard that I miss you a little bit

21
00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:33.470
Oh, attached. Oh, you said

22
00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:36.090
I promise I should buy it anyway

23
00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.050
Our CEO

24
00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:39.150
But Jiangzhou First Meeting

25
00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.150
This is the brain behind the Chamber of Commerce

26
00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:42.760
Come to Jiangzhou

27
00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:46.020
Only a few people can survive the calamity, Mr. Gao

28
00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.520
It's the new center

29
00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:49.580
I return the new chamber of commerce

30
00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:50.600
Could it be that

31
00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:54.560
A super consortium with mature fans and uncle?

32
00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:55.780
are you okay

33
00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.860
Why is there a new chamber of commerce?

34
00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:01.060
I did it right

35
00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:03.030
But all of them have to be protected

36
00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:08.180
If he comes, he will be able to directly support the economic growth of the country.

37
00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.070
I also spent a lot of effort

38
00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:14.840
I also met another minister, Ms. Yang

39
00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:17.490
You are talking about the Brother Yang Gang

40
00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:19.060
he is my person
