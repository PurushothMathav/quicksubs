00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:03.030
Young Master, it’s all my fault for eating.

2
00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:04.350
I'm going to cut it for you.

3
00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:07.390
You were so humiliated before, but now it's too late to cut you off.

4
00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.270
Young Master, I didn’t know your identity before. I was wrong.

5
00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:12.810
I was really wrong. It turns out I was wrong too.

6
00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:14.830
You're wrong, you mean. those ordinary people,

7
00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:16.270
Just any happy thing.

8
00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:17.710
I'll go with my brother

9
00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:18.950
You are the ones using Zhao Shifeng

10
00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:27.080
Why don't I want to see you? Of course

11
00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:29.530
You were important to me before

12
00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:32.800
I have always been a comrade. Come and move everyone.

13
00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:33.680
Your current status

14
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.680
Mentioned that she was the right person for the business

15
00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:37.560
I will go to see my husband today

16
00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:38.420
Find them

17
00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:39.980
Just go and do your business first. No need to do it.

18
00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:51.300
Then this is the life of a heavenly being

19
00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:56.350
Look for the same thing

20
00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.190
Now I was just arrived by Xiaoye

21
00:00:58.190 --> 00:00:59.330
Don't want to live anymore

22
00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:00.090
this is not me

23
00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.270
I don't know the way

24
00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:01.930
I'm wearing my identity

25
00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:03.880
He was alive before

26
00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:05.920
Who are you when you are younger? Remember?

27
00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.120
I'm at the bar tonight

28
00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:08.060
You hit me

29
00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.920
That bar saw the door

30
00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:13.620
What are you doing when you touch the door and go down?

31
00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:15.410
Let's go back and watch you leave first

32
00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:16.780
Let me tell you who said it

33
00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:18.670
It’s not that I have endless talk

34
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:20.840
It's better to use it as a house.

35
00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.720
You made my floor wide open

36
00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:23.770
You do it

37
00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.940
Very clean for me

38
00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:27.190
Then if I don’t do it, I’ll be too small

39
00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:28.210
It's quite full at ordinary times

40
00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:29.170
If you can't

41
00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:32.470
I can't remember what happened yesterday.

42
00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:36.940
Don't go too far

43
00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:38.760
I'm looking too much

44
00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:40.300
I have this knowledge

45
00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:42.860
Young Master, I am a half-spiritual person.

46
00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:43.800
I let you stand

47
00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:45.210
You have to stand

48
00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.550
I let you

49
00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:50.820
You were saved well. If you know it, stop it.
