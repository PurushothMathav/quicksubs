00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:03.810
Why are you so angry? You haven't said anything for so long, right?

2
00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:05.850
Why do you care so much about their people?

3
00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.020
Make things difficult for me. Since you're fine, I'll take you away.

4
00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:11.130
No, I'll wait until I get on stage.

5
00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:16.340
You want to say, this is not good,

6
00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.580
I didn’t say that last time. I learned it well,

7
00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:22.570
It still works. This watch is already like this.

8
00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:24.580
I think it's best to change your mind.

9
00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:27.440
Don't say it anymore, it's naturally very good,

10
00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.990
Not so much before. The boss wants to throw him away,

11
00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:32.600
I can't keep it. Small set.

12
00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.540
I won't let you feel ashamed, Mom. Why are you still here?

13
00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:39.290
You really think I dare not take action. Seriously let me share. yes.

14
00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:41.450
Why do you still need to remind me?

15
00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:42.860
If I leave

16
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.640
You can't do this with your eyes.

17
00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:47.660
You shouldn't be able to say

18
00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:49.560
Are you burning your eyes out again?

19
00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:50.660
Burning eyes in half a knot

20
00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:52.160
Even though you told me

21
00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.340
It doesn't matter if Haton half-burns Dahui

22
00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:56.640
But this won’t stop you, hurry up

23
00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.660
Nope Nope
