00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:01.810
What can be said directly?

2
00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:05.780
Well, that's it. Do you want to go eat a full meal?

3
00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:08.510
rouse, rouse,

4
00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:13.440
If you really donâ€™t agree, our investment plan this time,

5
00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.040
The original purchase was successful and I used the funds to get me down.

6
00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:21.980
Set up a big business and get the money to invest in the next item.

7
00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:24.980
Well, this company is publishing the first half,

8
00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:27.800
Do these two words have any silly meaning?

9
00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:30.260
It's true, that's it, we can meet the goal,

10
00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:33.070
That is to give more foreign investment, and to surpass foreign investment.

11
00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:34.870
I always talk about going global

12
00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.240
Irregularity comes from

13
00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:38.700
You have such a red-hot plan

14
00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.760
Old dragon, I must learn the truth

15
00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:43.410
I'll leave first

16
00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:47.760
Which one of your words is correct?

17
00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:48.820
Can you have no influence

18
00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.920
It's time to find someone gtz's location, forget it, what are you doing?

19
00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:56.440
This location is very popular

20
00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:59.720
Oh my god, it's still good. Oh my god.

21
00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:01.340
Thinking about this position

22
00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:02.720
Impossible to go

23
00:01:04.209 --> 00:01:05.269
I'm a candidate

24
00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:09.440
Ding Taiji Luan, Chairman, go while you can
