00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:06.420
When I met, Secretary Yang was indeed smart.

2
00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:09.580
Okay, it turns out you are all in the same group.

3
00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:13.100
We two have no enmity, why should we do it?

4
00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.980
That's not all thanks to a few of them,

5
00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.570
Otherwise, with the skills of a female Secretary Yang,

6
00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.090
We may be able to get money so easily by just counting hands,

7
00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.080
Now it seems like there are very few people in Jiangzhou all of a sudden.

8
00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.080
I'm afraid you'll deal with it,

9
00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:30.200
That boy with a different surname,

10
00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:31.640
The main show has not finished yet

11
00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.200
It’s not just whatever I want to do with this

12
00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:38.580
You want to learn something, so you have to bring it all with you

13
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.720
It’s not like I’m following them

14
00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.060
They learn from me

15
00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:46.000
Huaxing Chamber of Commerce is such a great experience

16
00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:51.810
How can a motorcycle boy be remembered as Secretary Yang?

17
00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.930
Do you think so, President?

18
00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.070
Don't talk nonsense to him

19
00:00:58.030 --> 00:00:58.710
It's good to bury this bitch quickly

20
00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:01.480
Bury this stinky cousin to the president

21
00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:03.300
He has those hopes not to leave

22
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.879
You can't let him lie down

23
00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:08.220
You can't wait to see if we can successfully cooperate on this matter.

24
00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:17.350
What's the chance? You have a lot of health insurance. It's easy to tell. It's easy to tell. Hurry up.
