00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:06.560
Please, please, please, no,

2
00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:08.890
You can't shout well here,

3
00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:11.740
As expected, I came to save you. What do you mean?

4
00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:12.960
Did you do it on purpose?

5
00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:15.240
I'm so sorry, I lied to you,

6
00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:16.870
In fact, I give you more meaning.

7
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.150
I believe it, you really lied to me!

8
00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.790
How do you put it? It's not really a military situation.

9
00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.020
I thought you were the king of all families,

10
00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:39.140
Qinghou never thought that you are nothing,

11
00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:41.300
You do this all the time for nothing.

12
00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.640
Do you know that we are full of the three societies of Hua Xing,

13
00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:47.180
He persuaded everyone he came to and finally recommended him to the whole country.

14
00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:50.870
I'm not so willing to do that. Really

15
00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:52.880
How about roasting and drinking?

16
00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:53.980
How to roast and drink

17
00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:58.730
What other nonsense are you talking about?

18
00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:00.500
Guan family enterprise

19
00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.040
I believe you are dead

20
00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:03.020
Donâ€™t you know yet?

21
00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.150
you will die soon

22
00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:09.710
Tell me what you do

23
00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.000
Now I've done you no harm

24
00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:15.550
Why don't you wait for him to taste it? I'm just looking for it.

25
00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.160
Do you think someone with a good smell can get along well?

26
00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:23.190
It's like you are related in it

27
00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:25.850
How can I make you go away?

28
00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:29.420
Many seven introductions

29
00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:34.270
You guys are here at the joint, you are also here

30
00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:35.640
The last killer

31
00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:37.980
It's you who decides it's me

32
00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:39.500
What kind of

33
00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:40.340
That's okay

34
00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:41.520
Thank you for giving it to you

35
00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:43.190
Otherwise my mother

36
00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:44.530
What are you doing, you caught it

37
00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:48.230
Then ask my mother for the apartment No. 1

38
00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:50.180
But I still look good enough to be dead to you.

39
00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:51.430
Whatever you want is fine

40
00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:53.250
Wait until I misjudge you
