00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:04.010
What do you want to say? What do I want to say?

2
00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.560
Let me ask you about the dismantling of the group in Tokyo

3
00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:07.900
Did you ever sing Telephone?

4
00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:09.680
What happened?

5
00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:11.470
Today I said that I will take the oral exam

6
00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:12.770
This is her fate

7
00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:16.720
You are a blind thing

8
00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:18.480
Can you consider oral considerations when doing things?

9
00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.200
Do you know this family

10
00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:22.290
That's vegetarian

11
00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:24.450
The Tokyo demolition team was originally a mess

12
00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:26.530
I could only order one pack for them

13
00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:29.360
Besides, he said he was dead today

14
00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:31.720
What can we do? It's up to you.

15
00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:33.280
That family is saving their lives

16
00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:34.980
That's just one way to raise money.

17
00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:08.560
I don’t know

18
00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.500
I'll know it was us who did it

19
00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.830
The people among them can be finer than ours.

20
00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:17.880
We are miserable enough

21
00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:22.160
I will still have it easier than him

22
00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.520
The girl I will choose will not be favored

23
00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:34.180
We won't be able to protect you anymore

24
00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:36.480
If not, I’ll take my promise.

25
00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:40.420
Dad but thank you
