00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.830
Oh my god? What the player flag said is actually true.

2
00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:06.430
Really put the useless air machines on the street to gunfight.

3
00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:08.700
I think this woman is blind,

4
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.440
Let the two representatives of the wind on the street,

5
00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:13.040
As a part-time worker, what do you think?

6
00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:16.800
Really? You've put me on my pedestal's behalf,

7
00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.300
Let it be a group dance on the street,

8
00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:21.390
It’s been less than ten years. Know.

9
00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:22.740
This half-family business

10
00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:25.570
I really don’t know how many more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more.

11
00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:26.510
Remember me less

12
00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:28.060
Do you think this is the right country?

13
00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:30.880
I don’t know why I died for a while. I’ll leave it alone.

14
00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.240
you have to think clearly

15
00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:34.300
What are the consequences of this for us?

16
00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.220
What a national crisis for you

17
00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:38.880
So much for this

18
00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:43.920
I still need to ask you what to do next without your dog Pei.

19
00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.100
As for your letter question

20
00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:47.660
You are a society

21
00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:48.780
The garbage at the bottom

22
00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:50.840
I wonder how?

23
00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:52.800
It's not what I said that means taking action.
