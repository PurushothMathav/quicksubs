00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:02.220
Tuhuohui,

2
00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.120
That thing had already made a plan with a coward,

3
00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:07.240
Even what they say is true or false.

4
00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:08.940
Have you ever thought about it?

5
00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:14.770
I'm not something that can deal with someone else's lack. Yes, people are valuable,

6
00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:17.020
You spend so much money on marriage,

7
00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:19.090
That helps you live and die, introduction,

8
00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:21.430
Don't listen to the nonsense, he said he is really capable,

9
00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:23.840
You have to wait until you get older, that’s right.

10
00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:25.940
If you are really that capable,

11
00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:27.490
You go and get Chu Laojiao,

12
00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:29.850
If anything happens, we should make it clear if we do it properly.

13
00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:33.620
Boy, don’t stick to the Chinese,

14
00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:38.180
Ambien,

15
00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.780
Out of the Chinese, out of the Chinese, out of the Chinese, out of the Chinese, out of the Chinese, out of the Chinese, out of the Chinese, out of the Chinese, out of the Chinese, out of the Chinese, out of the Chinese, what?

16
00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:41.460
What's going on

17
00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:45.180
Why can't I get through on the phone? Miss Xia

18
00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.020
you have seen

19
00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.140
I told you earlier

20
00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:48.120
Is this kid unreliable?

21
00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:49.580
He even dares to lie to you

22
00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:51.400
Isn't this lonely?

23
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:52.340
Now this matter

24
00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:55.210
You're not going to explain it yet, aren't you?

25
00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:56.570
Maybe that's true

26
00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:58.330
The non-original understanding lies in you

27
00:00:58.330 --> 00:00:59.670
Such a result

28
00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.230
You actually flashed me a message

29
00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:02.720
this is boring
