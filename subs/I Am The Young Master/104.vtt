00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:16.239
This is the skill of our mother and son, right?

2
00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.140
Yes! Conditions?

3
00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:19.900
A program that was actually talked about?

4
00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:21.560
Shall I watch you go in first? No,

5
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.000
The following is waiting for me. I go in like this,

6
00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:37.530
I helped me get in.

7
00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.780
Are you Xiaoyue? Who are you?

8
00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:41.970
I am your dad! Just say,

9
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.020
I just came back from being alone, and I won’t be young for you much longer.

10
00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.740
How are you and your mom?

11
00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:48.260
Where did the movie come from? I don’t have a dad,

12
00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.020
My mother is long dead. I'm not a movie.

13
00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.180
I am really your dad. I can’t find any reason in the Year of the Mother.

14
00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:55.590
After separation, your mother is still pregnant with you.

15
00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:58.000
I had no choice but to influence the road and make money.

16
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.960
Otherwise, you would have left Yuncheng with your mother.

17
00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:03.730
we lost contact

18
00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:08.860
I only recently found out that you guys are in Jiangzhou. Please say goodbye.

19
00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:11.790
Nowadays, liars are becoming more and more carefree.

20
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.560
I didn't give you one first

21
00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:14.480
what am i

22
00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:18.400
Something happened to a small

23
00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.300
You see it can get faster and faster

24
00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:29.320
What happened to him?

25
00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:34.320
I don’t know either. I’m not young anymore.

26
00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:39.010
Others Xiaofei passed by

27
00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:41.370
The woman is taking you to your heart here

28
00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.950
You're such a complicated person

29
00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.330
Following you and your thinking

30
00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:49.800
I've heard about you too

31
00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.080
What are you talking about?

32
00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:52.580
Without my grandma

33
00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:53.780
You asked me back

34
00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.250
Already learned to be a son

35
00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:56.290
They bully Xiaojun

36
00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:09.539
I'm already big

37
00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:09.840
a friend
