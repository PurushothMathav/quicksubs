00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:02.920
Say, what did you promise me to do?

2
00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:05.670
It's you I promise. Do you know who he is?

3
00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:09.990
This one, you can tell me!

4
00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.400
You are our distinguished guest!

5
00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.660
Why do you want to exclusive customers? He is just a bar,

6
00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:17.360
Look at the gate! Out!

7
00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:18.920
If you dare to answer me, tell my uncle!

8
00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:21.080
Master, for your father's sake,

9
00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:24.780
You are really the one who laughs, but you are really sensible.

10
00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:29.850
But you still accept me, and I am so old that I don’t look good,

11
00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:32.790
Lucky for him, you are so nice but Tokyo is paying a fee,

12
00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.150
Answer me!

13
00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:41.110
Master, I don’t dare to do it and I still need you. Don’t be so hasty.

14
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:48.500
Don't be in a hurry

15
00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:49.260
How do you listen better?

16
00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.240
I knew you were these people to me

17
00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:54.180
I told you that I will always be safe with you.

18
00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.240
Wait a few days

19
00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:58.240
I will definitely give you a good show

20
00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:59.640
you are in a bad mood

21
00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:00.820
Remove three hearts first

22
00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:01.720
other things

23
00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:02.780
How can we talk about it later?

24
00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:04.200
I'm in a bad mood now

25
00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.510
Don't you exclude me?

26
00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:08.550
something important

27
00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.000
I'll contact you later

28
00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:13.410
Why just now

29
00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:15.140
Don't let me export your identity

30
00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:16.140
I just want to know

31
00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.220
this joint

32
00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.120
What does it have to do with me?

33
00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:19.520
He is your teammate

34
00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.920
Because some people estimate that the old man's side

35
00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.700
But the rhythm is also natural and environmental

36
00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:24.520
If this continues

37
00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.720
Accelerate internal competition

38
00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:28.160
Sooner or later the player will be expelled
