00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:01.990
Master, how are you?

2
00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:03.720
In fact, for example, this

3
00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:06.220
And I have no money at all. The young master told us,

4
00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:08.200
But itâ€™s so tiring.

5
00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:09.900
What's really going on?

6
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.540
We are here and you still want to touch me.

7
00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:15.860
Dad, let me tell you, I will leave the words to you today,

8
00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:17.940
20 million, return a car,

9
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.040
Fifty million, completely, not a penny less.

10
00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.420
The dog family is really weak, although it is the same,

11
00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:29.020
Why so late?

12
00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:39.460
Tonight, right? Come.

13
00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:41.780
Is there only money in this card?

14
00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:43.390
OK, let me tell you,

15
00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:44.890
Don't interact with me. Or I,

16
00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:45.890
They'll kill you

17
00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:47.500
If you don't believe it

18
00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:55.160
Who will walk if I hit you?

19
00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:00.450
what are you doing

20
00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:01.710
what are you doing

21
00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.970
If you need it, let me take care of your car.

22
00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:04.970
What on earth did you do

23
00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:07.830
need you

24
00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.250
How do you want to be right?

25
00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.890
How do you need to go

26
00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:23.880
We are, right?
