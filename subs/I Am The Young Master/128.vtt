00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.160
What do you fear most?

2
00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:06.880
This is the wood clothing support battle level, which is my ranking in the Philippines.

3
00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:09.810
Worth 5 million bedding.

4
00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:13.160
The truth is, this cutie is worth 5 million,

5
00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:15.180
It also became Mijie, Dada,

6
00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:18.080
What are you doing? Old men don’t even go down anymore.

7
00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:21.140
I gave this to President Wan,

8
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.720
Why are you here today?

9
00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:26.790
What I said, it turns out you are a kid,

10
00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:29.550
I'm just a lover, but I'm also such a slut,

11
00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:32.290
Even the things my dad gave to Chairman Wan,

12
00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:32.910
All with him.

13
00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:35.420
You don’t want to live, right?

14
00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:37.680
do what you do

15
00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:40.980
It's my dad for my dad

16
00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:43.200
Do you want to say Wan Peichang?

17
00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.750
It’s just that your dad is good

18
00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:48.740
Really? It makes me laugh to death. Wan Peichang

19
00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:49.600
If it's your father's

20
00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:50.780
I'm more expensive

21
00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:51.540
Learn without teaching

22
00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:53.860
You said this yourself. I was wrong.

23
00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:56.290
But if you brag about girls, my dad

24
00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:58.210
You beat me into a dead dog

25
00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:03.330
Where have all gone?

26
00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.830
Are you okay, Mr. Zhang?

27
00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:09.860
Who are you?

28
00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:11.480
He prefers not to live.

29
00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:12.550
He is not Latin

30
00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:14.730
You guys will die if you start a group fight, no?

31
00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:16.170
Your stuff is overpriced

32
00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.110
Look at their explanation

33
00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:19.170
I've already explained

34
00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:20.740
It's because they don't believe it

35
00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.000
you will pay the price

36
00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:24.270
It's been a long time

37
00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:25.210
method president

38
00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:26.370
Such a very different person

39
00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:27.390
I'm too tall

40
00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:29.350
If you leave it alone, you won’t be talking about destruction.

41
00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:30.910
Don't worry

42
00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:32.350
The method president came just a moment ago

43
00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:33.390
I see this guy

44
00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:34.530
How long can I live?

45
00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:37.440
Do you think it’s good?

46
00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:38.340
This method will last

47
00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.360
I haven't seen it either

48
00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:40.730
I also have to be friends

49
00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:51.390
He also said so
