00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.720
a little while longer,

2
00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:03.330
What's going on.

3
00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:04.960
Dad, they can't live anymore.

4
00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:06.840
He also took it over there to make money.

5
00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:08.670
OK. Enter again.

6
00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:10.510
eh eh eh eh

7
00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:12.630
I'll give you something when I eat it

8
00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:13.840
Yeah yeah

9
00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:14.980
Come on this

10
00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:15.800
we are

11
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.520
I just saved it for you

12
00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:18.770
this kind of thing

13
00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:22.100
I still look down on you, I declare

14
00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:24.020
Huaxing Chamber of Commerce

15
00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:25.560
Cancel the cooperation with grass price

16
00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:27.400
Then the president will grow like this

17
00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:29.110
we we know we were wrong

18
00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:29.990
We can be the same

19
00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:33.010
Next time, next time I won’t dare

20
00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:34.110
same words

21
00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.870
I remember he and Qinggao also said that

22
00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:36.830
I tell you

23
00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:38.370
I forgot the son of the spear thief

24
00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:39.890
Not all of us can understand

25
00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:40.910
Your example

26
00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.900
This is all your fault

27
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.720
You came back to our Chao House like this

28
00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:47.880
You really dare to kill me

29
00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.110
You are like this

30
00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.310
Dad, why do you blame me?

31
00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:52.280
You also guessed that you are right

32
00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.250
What’s this guy’s background like?

33
00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:02.330
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

34
00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:03.490
I said come here

35
00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:06.100
Don’t you believe it? Hello everyone

36
00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.200
My family's ten thousand moons

37
00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:09.680
Very happy for everyone's support

38
00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:13.940
I also want to thank Wangui Party for trusting me.

39
00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:16.620
I will try my best to treat him well
