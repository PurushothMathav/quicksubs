00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.370
Why are you here?

2
00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:04.470
Blind sister, you may have just returned from abroad,

3
00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:06.970
There are some things that I don’t understand, so I’ll give you the Dragon Dragon Arrow a little bit like this.

4
00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:08.750
Hungry is our young master Wanjie.

5
00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:09.590
How about this.

6
00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:13.810
Currently, among our Wan family, there is a Young Master Wan Jie.

7
00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:16.149
If you want to contact Mr. Wanjie,

8
00:00:16.329 --> 00:00:19.070
It couldn't be more appropriate.

9
00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:20.510
Let's go. why are you laughing?

10
00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:23.370
I laugh at you for being an old man,

11
00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:26.860
In addition to what I said, regarding the Ten Thousand Merchants Conference,

12
00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.390
Using you to take the lead in formulating, how can you specifically suck up such a thing.

13
00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:33.030
Except for the old man, he only asked me to be responsible for the money before receiving the reception.

14
00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:34.410
Behind the scenes

15
00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:35.750
The crime of losing the old man will be dealt with

16
00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:36.690
Let's process

17
00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:40.200
I heard you have any inside story

18
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.700
My uncle has a son who has been dead for many years

19
00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:44.400
He was chosen to become Wanjia

20
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:45.800
Cases that will continue in the future

21
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.320
He's talking about you

22
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:50.880
It’s a good idea to read the American news.

23
00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:51.570
That's what I'm saying
