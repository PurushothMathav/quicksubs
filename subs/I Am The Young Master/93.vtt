00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:03.760
Why is everyone forcing you to do this?

2
00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:05.700
Who wants to resist reporting?

3
00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.330
Teachers, havenâ€™t you played?

4
00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.090
The attitude of the group is that they are afraid of making false accusations again!

5
00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:12.110
It's better to make false accusations!

6
00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:15.630
My player, why are you already dead?

7
00:00:16.149 --> 00:00:17.890
Are your people unwilling to give up resistance anymore?

8
00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:20.870
What should I do?

9
00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:29.600
What kind of slope did I say?

10
00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.260
Did you say that? What did I say?

11
00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:33.960
Anything else, am I wrong about the holidays?

12
00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.600
I won't do this kind of thing, I will treat you like this,

13
00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:38.690
I will do this and everything will be the same!

14
00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:42.420
A few of us!

15
00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:46.360
The two of us said I was real!

16
00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:53.050
Said, said, said, said, said, said, said, said, said, said, said, said
