00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:03.140
Yang Jing, do you want to add me? Why?

2
00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:07.280
I think you are a good novice, and you can think about it today,

3
00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:08.740
I'm going to eat.

4
00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:11.160
Hahahaha, you have such a good eye.

5
00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:13.200
People in Yangjing cannot tell me what I am thinking.

6
00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:15.340
Ever since I was little, I have felt like a boss,

7
00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:18.200
Look at those who are to you, I say to others,

8
00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:20.420
It's funny, it's for me.

9
00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:22.100
That, I ion.

10
00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.300
Tens of thousands of people, I see them this way, but there are only six of them?

11
00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:33.160
But I thought to myself, often, not often, not often, not often, not often, not often, not often, not often, not often.

12
00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:33.800
Often not often not often not often not often.

13
00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:36.690
What could you have said before?

14
00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:40.180
That's a fair thing

15
00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:45.370
Then come back to this matter

16
00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:47.340
Get more rest

17
00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:49.110
I heard what happened to you

18
00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.770
are you okay

19
00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:52.540
I almost couldn't come back

20
00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:53.620
This starts from ten thousand

21
00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.910
The only thing I can't be content with is the loss of money.

22
00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:58.320
Those killers are not

23
00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:01.530
If I can't break away from him, I'll go too.

24
00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:05.980
It's not clear what I'm talking about.

25
00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:07.930
I'll leave this to you

26
00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:09.650
If you really have to pay tens of thousands of dollars to come back and commit the crime,

27
00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.020
The growth of investing and falling

28
00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.370
I want to tell you something about this

29
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.320
This is just in case it becomes difficult

30
00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:25.560
Now the family has already wanted to go in for you, but what?

31
00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:26.800
we need to deal with you

32
00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:32.910
There's just a lot of alive alive alive alive alive alive alive alive alive

33
00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:39.450
Alive, alive, alive, alive, alive, alive, alive, alive, alive

34
00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.330
Alive, alive, alive, alive, alive, alive, alive, alive, alive

35
00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:59.500
Alive, alive, alive, alive, alive, alive, alive, alive, alive

36
00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:06.420
Alive, alive, alive, alive, alive, alive, alive, alive, alive, alive, alive, alive, alive, alive, alive, alive, alive, alive, alive, alive, alive, alive, alive, alive, alive, alive, alive, alive, alive, alive, alive, alive, alive, alive, alive, alive alive alive
