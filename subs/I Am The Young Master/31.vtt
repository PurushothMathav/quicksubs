00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:02.480
I am really a male umbrella,

2
00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:04.310
How could it be?

3
00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:06.960
street. This little wind pricks me,

4
00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.300
Please vent my anger on you for not being admitted to the hospital.

5
00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:12.100
No, I’ll prove it to you,

6
00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:15.100
Let me pierce it, look at you,

7
00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:21.020
Look at you, it seems that you and I are hiding together, I see that you didn’t go in today,

8
00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.140
There is this, and there is another,

9
00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.440
OK, come to the street and leave it to me,

10
00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:30.670
Give me, give me, give me, give me,

11
00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:32.470
Give me, give me, give me, give me, give me,

12
00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.280
Give me, give me, give me, give me, give me, give me, give me, give me, give me, give me, give me,

13
00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.720
Give me, give me, give me, give me, give me, give me, give me, give me, give me, give me, give me, give me, give me, give me, give me, give me, give me , give me, give me, give me, give me, give me, give me, give me, give me, give me, give me, give me, give me, give me, give me, give me, give me, give Me, give me, give me, give me, give me, give me, give me, give me, give me,

14
00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:50.820
There are also waves of energy in this world

15
00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:52.010
I am Xiaoshu

16
00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:54.150
People's rhythm is already married

17
00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:56.750
Just don't think about it, I'll take a look

18
00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:58.900
You and that Wanjia Qi?

19
00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:00.200
This is not a coincidence, but it is extremely unfortunate.

20
00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:01.620
Don't mention him to me

21
00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:03.150
He's just like a little jumper

22
00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:04.680
Use me to catch him to death

23
00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:08.300
What's the status of people's rhythm? Okay.

24
00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.520
Are you saying you have to do something wrong?

25
00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.020
I have to get married.

26
00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:18.240
sorry

27
00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:19.780
We definitely failed today
