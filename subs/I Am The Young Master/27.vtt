00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.510
Having said that, I didn’t even think about going to work.

2
00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:06.630
I can afford it.

3
00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:09.950
Can you ask for it? I myself don’t even have a job as a security guard.

4
00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:11.910
Still a security guard.

5
00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.440
If you are old, you will die together.

6
00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:16.379
I hope we can see the knowledge of your love,

7
00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.040
The previous rice knowledge, yes,

8
00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:21.360
Everything else is good. As for me,

9
00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.540
Arrange with you this, those,

10
00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:26.240
There is definitely no problem in setting up less work.

11
00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:28.860
You still have this bit of power, otherwise it would be your feelings back then,

12
00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:32.750
Just looking for you. You are too disrespectful

13
00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:34.810
Too much fans

14
00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:35.550
I tell you

15
00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:36.700
in this society

16
00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:39.420
The most worthless thing is to hurry up with you and me

17
00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.000
Now it’s not me either

18
00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:43.280
Being a deadbeat like you

19
00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:45.430
Bai Yi was right for once

20
00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:47.350
We are indeed not from the same world

21
00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:50.700
Don’t coax me when the time comes

22
00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:53.830
Are you laughing again?

23
00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:54.870
because you just

24
00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.380
We've been telling you for so long

25
00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:59.280
It’s already a big face for you

26
00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:01.440
What qualifications do you have to let us go?

27
00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.370
Wan Shao, you are finally here

28
00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:15.410
What's going on

29
00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:17.120
Is this today’s new brain?

30
00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.540
Why is it that the player rides the sound?

31
00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:20.500
Why is he quarreling with you?

32
00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:21.420
He must be a believer

33
00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:23.120
Mr. Wan Xiu Wan

34
00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:24.660
Wan Jiaqi also believes in Wan

35
00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:26.500
Don't recognize him
