00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Challenge, you asked for it,

2
00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:04.580
You say that you are a trash at the bottom of society,

3
00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:07.740
There's no need to talk, he's offending Mr. Jie,

4
00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:09.580
I won't take a look, I won't take a look,

5
00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:12.200
You should take a look, don’t take a look, don’t take a look, don’t take a look,

6
00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:13.940
No look, no look, no look, no look, no look, no look, no look, no look, no look, no look, no look, no look, no

7
00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:17.230
Take a look, don’t take a look, don’t take a look,

8
00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:19.090
Not a glance, not a glance, not a glance, not a glance, not a glance, not a glance, not a glance

9
00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.270
Eye, don't do it, don't do it

10
00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:28.770
There is a young man here, I will give it to you, so you have nothing to fear and let him go.

11
00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:32.290
After we finished for a while, there was a county sister

12
00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:34.190
Why don't you come here when you are older?

13
00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:35.430
I have nothing to do today

14
00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:36.850
Sister Jun came over to see

15
00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:38.990
What is this, Miss County?

16
00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.890
You came just in time

17
00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:41.070
The person this little dragon offended

18
00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.770
I still don’t take your Song Ye seriously

19
00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:43.810
I'm preparing to teach you a lesson

20
00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:44.700
What's the meaning

21
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:45.640
This piece of shit

22
00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:49.860
It’s not like Song Ye wanted to make friends with him, but why?

23
00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:51.380
This is a gift from Song Ye

24
00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:53.190
Don’t play all the time now?

25
00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:57.270
This is Song Ye’s Jinkou

26
00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:58.630
How dare you call her rags?
