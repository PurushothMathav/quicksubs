00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:03.950
Take a photo and take a look,

2
00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:06.140
Is this what you are looking for? Yes,

3
00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:07.500
How did you find it?

4
00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:09.300
Please trust our services,

5
00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:11.580
I don't want this anymore. I'll disappear for a while.

6
00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:12.800
Is this important to you?

7
00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:14.520
I don’t know how I got here when I could just stroll around.

8
00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:17.220
Didn’t you think about it before you finished reading? Don’t you remember that you came?

9
00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:19.980
I always feel that a lot of things have happened to me,

10
00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:21.420
I don’t remember many of them.

11
00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:24.360
I don't know, if you want less, just express it quickly, I am a very concerned about you.

12
00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:25.900
I can ask you a personal question about your experience,

13
00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.380
What is your relationship with our Xiong Nian?

14
00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:32.820
In the Year of the Bear, what is the third wife without?

15
00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.330
If nothing happens

16
00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:36.880
I also accept

17
00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:37.950
that question

18
00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:38.990
Bet on posture and force treasure

19
00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:49.280
You must be careful to ask

20
00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:50.960
What are you doing, young master?

21
00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:52.320
I'm in trouble

22
00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:54.670
What did a guy ask me?

23
00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:56.590
I actually need to marry me

24
00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:57.970
Even the cockroaches are done.

25
00:00:59.290 --> 00:00:59.870
Just three years later so what?

26
00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.350
Tell me about the body I like

27
00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:03.260
You seem to be ignoring me

28
00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:04.459
I haven't thought about you

29
00:01:04.459 --> 00:01:06.480
But you are loud again

30
00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:07.440
You also do the opposite

31
00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:09.040
I tell you to be together

32
00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:10.180
I'll change you out immediately

33
00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:10.900
What are you doing?

34
00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:16.710
I've heard, I've heard, I can't do anything to you

35
00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:19.050
I'll give you a bar and I'm doing the right thing

36
00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:20.710
That is the place of the future Miss Yang

37
00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:21.510
You will solve it later

38
00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:22.510
I was thinking about it just now

39
00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:23.290
Hundreds of thousands of people

40
00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:24.610
I will always give you what I have
