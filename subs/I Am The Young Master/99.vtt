1
00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:13.770
I have been asking about it for so many years,

2
00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:17.190
After poaching the industry and going to conferences, we finally became the best hidden talent group in the global mobile phone industry.

3
00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:19.660
It's a pity that I'm so fierce,

4
00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.800
Otherwise, I want some flags that you can use to confirm me.

5
00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.440
Is it in Jiangzhou? President,

6
00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:28.470
This parent-child meeting report,

7
00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.050
Please Guo Meng, is this thing reliable?

8
00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:33.730
Please rest assured. If you hadn’t gotten this report,

9
00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.890
I'm afraid we can't find the lady and the young master either,

10
00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:38.850
only,

11
00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.440
Say it, President,

12
00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:42.360
You are now in Kyushu Hand District,

13
00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.480
Unify the world's finance, industry and real estate,

14
00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.540
But ladies,

15
00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:47.160
The young master lived a very happy life

16
00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.040
The young master is taking them to confiscate the plates

17
00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.970
And the madam will help others kill the dishes again

18
00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.700
I'm sorry to invite them.

19
00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:56.040
He pulled the child up by himself

20
00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.740
It’s really not as good as me serving the country this time

21
00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:01.240
I must buy one from that year.

22
00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:09.700
Hey, come on, touch and hold Tototo

23
00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:10.680
Okay, right away, right away

24
00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:18.230
I'm going to be busy. I'm busy. Thank you.

25
00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:19.770
I'll give you TotoToto

26
00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.110
Immediately Immediately

27
00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:36.060
Business used to go down like this

28
00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.090
How long does it take for us to cancel?

29
00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:44.490
It's time

30
00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:45.630
So much better

31
00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.340
Can this go away? Are you like this?
