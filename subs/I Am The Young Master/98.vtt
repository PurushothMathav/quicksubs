00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.230
Maybe I can start pulling iron, but I never really go much.

2
00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:06.830
Or eat,

3
00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:08.840
Yes, it’s a good idea to bring this place up there,

4
00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:10.600
All the money came out in one year,

5
00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:13.180
Well, that's enough to make you laugh.

6
00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:15.120
You mean, the lady's child's child,

7
00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:17.170
They didn't have names before,

8
00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:19.460
When I dropped it after taking the photo,

9
00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:22.840
I found out that they couldn't give it to me, but that was the problem for me.

10
00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.140
Being told this way, this is the news,

11
00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.740
You hold it to death, yes,

12
00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:44.370
I'm holding you,

13
00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.060
A company, I heard that you have made a wish,

14
00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.520
Are you okay? I heard,

15
00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:54.490
Are you in good health? How are you doing recently?

16
00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:56.540
Well, my body is much better,

17
00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:59.770
Otherwise, you go back to the capital first

18
00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:03.010
I'll send someone to pick you up right now. Are you okay?

19
00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:04.810
Now Huajing Student Association

20
00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:05.990
I'm talking about tags

21
00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:07.170
I'm getting ready

22
00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.190
From Tianhaiduo

23
00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:10.170
Then start to contact overseas channels

24
00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:13.240
no night period

25
00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:14.760
Return to the family

26
00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:17.820
It’s really not going to be a big cleanup.

27
00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:21.060
How long will it take you to check?

28
00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:38.230
Tianhai is a good place for gathering, comrade is good

29
00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.410
Talking about the beautiful scenery you see

30
00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:42.960
Too much is too much

31
00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:44.700
We humans are small

32
00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:46.790
But we can use our own hands

33
00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:48.780
Run to your own home

34
00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:50.800
How do you say something?

35
00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:52.030
give me a point

36
00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:53.580
What kind of earth will my car move?
