1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.610
It's enough to leave home.

2
00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:03.630
Deal with him against us. Can you help me for an hour?

3
00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:06.470
Maybe I still underestimate it?

4
00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:10.730
Energy beside wealth. Although the assets beside the wealth are not satisfactory enough.

5
00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.710
But we can throw away the meaning of the two words.

6
00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:19.120
You Zihao, that night line you mentioned

7
00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:21.360
He is indeed a construction worker for a construction site dealer

8
00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:24.990
I want even though the door is not wide enough

9
00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.850
I'm going to do one of the regular tasks

10
00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.050
You say we are villains

11
00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.410
Your Building Official Means Music and Instrumental Relationships

12
00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:39.950
Not difficult to force

13
00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.980
You're doing well as president in business

14
00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:48.240
Come on, stop looking at yourself and think you are a villain

15
00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.380
In business matters, the military plan becomes worse.

16
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.380
Dare to come out with a hand to restore the master

17
00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:57.740
You are the villain that people must ask you about, right?

18
00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:04.190
Mr. Novice Fu will be there

19
00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.440
We all underestimated the tricks of your bankers.

20
00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.180
Give us a synergy statement

21
00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.040
Fifth Brother, there is nothing you can do if you are not worried.

22
00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.930
Grandpa, what are you afraid of?

23
00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.650
Your family is not enough to make the world come behind

24
00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:28.530
It would take billions of capital to make a difference

25
00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.110
In the early stage, it’s unclear if you don’t know how to move.

26
00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:31.850
Now we have nine major world powers signing

27
00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:34.630
There is no one with assets over 100 billion

28
00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.750
As long as we remove the front from the original

29
00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:40.310
Not everyone will be cheered up

30
00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.110
If it weren't for Qin Shaohuang Luo Shao

31
00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:44.050
Even if the main family is united

32
00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:46.340
I'm afraid we'll all suffer if we all leave.

33
00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.960
Can you admit that you have to let us go today?
