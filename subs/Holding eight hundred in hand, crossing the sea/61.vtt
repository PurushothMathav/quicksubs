00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.370
Police frog, interesting,

2
00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:04.510
interesting. I would like to ask,

3
00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:06.370
Why are you qualified to say such things?

4
00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:09.090
Don't worry about the wind blowing away the snake.

5
00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.790
This kind of singing, even I don't dare to talk like this,

6
00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:15.280
This is looking for death.

7
00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.240
Don't tell me that you are secretly running these listed companies.

8
00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:21.580
I have investigated clearly. Just a few days ago,

9
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.620
You are still a worker at a construction site,

10
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.800
I canâ€™t go out to the construction site more than once a year.

11
00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:29.180
There is simply no time or ability to run other businesses.

12
00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:33.110
Mr. Diu, you have been such a loser so early.

13
00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:34.950
Break into my house

14
00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:38.990
Do you really have any feelings?

15
00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:43.040
Xiaoxiang, you are so good

16
00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.650
Yangzhou City is nothing more than a fourth-tier town.

17
00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:47.470
How do you know what I say?

18
00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:50.170
Release the car and take it to a fourth-tier town

19
00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:52.380
That is also a market worth over 100 billion yuan.

20
00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:54.040
Is it you who can hurt each other?

21
00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.790
I can't laugh about this

22
00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.430
Fifty-one mentioned

23
00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.310
I really can't listen anymore

24
00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:06.830
It's no use blowing the cowhide to the sky once you get fat

25
00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.670
I want to see how many assets you have

26
00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:11.490
Dare to be presumptuous in front of Mr. Lu

27
00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.270
Stop using it carelessly and asking for it to be cleaned up.

28
00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:15.250
This is a waste of assets

29
00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:17.310
These life assets

30
00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.580
Save time and money for several years

31
00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.520
What's the use of trying hard?

32
00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:34.900
Several generations and centuries of experience

33
00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.020
It's a ruined building that you have worked hard for for several years.

34
00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:40.060
What are you comparing us to?

35
00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:44.110
we know what family means

36
00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:45.810
You saw it
