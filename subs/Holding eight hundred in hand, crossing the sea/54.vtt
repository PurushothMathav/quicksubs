00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:02.720
What are you going to do? What are you going to do?

2
00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:06.000
My experience is that of a wealthy person with disabilities.

3
00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:09.260
I'll give you some points. Don't ride too heavy.

4
00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.220
You boy, how do you speak?

5
00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.160
No more country. I need to eat then.

6
00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:19.030
Ha, a few minutes away, come over here.

7
00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:23.100
Stay as usual. Don't think that you are a superior, pure adult.

8
00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:25.480
Can no one control you?

9
00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.920
Oh, Mr. Ye, you are worthy of my hard work.

10
00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:33.820
Arenâ€™t we afraid of burdening others with our own hands?

11
00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.760
My hands have been connected to my hands on others.

12
00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:44.320
The existence of a country that cannot be forced

13
00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.800
That doesn't make sense either

14
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.880
you surpassed him

15
00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.530
That's what you call influence

16
00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.360
Open my faction and see

17
00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:03.400
If you bully the heart-to-heart Blessed Lord, take action

18
00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:05.090
Let me ask you Mr. Lu

19
00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:11.530
In front of novice Gu

20
00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.880
Don't ask for success with fox hands

21
00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:21.960
The kind of streak you can't hear is dead

22
00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:25.860
You can die

23
00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:36.080
I'll give you a chance to eat in the end, but you can't do it
