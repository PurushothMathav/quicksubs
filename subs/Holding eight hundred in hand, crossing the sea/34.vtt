00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:04.010
Mr. Ye. Mrs. Ye.

2
00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:06.370
This is the best room in Chunlin Villa.

3
00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:08.310
You two are resting now.

4
00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:10.550
After a while, when Zhaojiagui started,

5
00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.090
I will tell you the relationship between the two of you in the sun.

6
00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:16.320
few. Can't we participate?

7
00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:18.310
Of course.

8
00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:22.720
Then I feel relieved. I started to do enough homework.

9
00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.580
Wife, you said if we wanted to be angry,

10
00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:28.920
I really got this tens of billions contract,

11
00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:33.150
Of course, we don’t have to worry about emotional intelligence, right?

12
00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:37.170
We've all got this 100-year contract.

13
00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.000
Wouldn't it be better if they earned it themselves?

14
00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.340
You are still too naive

15
00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:44.960
I'm being kicked out of the road now

16
00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:47.520
No background, no background

17
00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.780
It’s too risky to do it yourself

18
00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:53.380
This isn't the turning point either.

19
00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:57.720
You can make the Qin family passionate about you.

20
00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.930
That's a hundred and one contract.

21
00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.580
Now only a number is left

22
00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.960
I remember when you risked your life

23
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.000
You're going to scatter every bite, right?

24
00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:14.920
Where are these breaks?

25
00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:16.460
I'll bother you

26
00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:20.420
Some friends are like this

27
00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:22.540
Why don't I take care of you?

28
00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.660
Which will be discussed later
