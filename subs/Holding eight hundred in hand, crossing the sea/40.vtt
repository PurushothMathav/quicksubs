00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.700
We can prove who got the show money

8
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:25.340
Simple wallet from nowhere

9
00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:26.840
It'll be mine soon

10
00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:31.620
Today I will accompany you

11
00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:36.410
This time the bank produced a black card

12
00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:42.720
What does a new card prove?

13
00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:00.900
How many years have you been doing this?

14
00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.040
Why do they say it costs people?

15
00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:09.290
What kind of person do you think you are? How many years have you spent a lot of money?

16
00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:13.760
It's my own money

17
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.280
There's just a few cents in there

18
00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:22.080
It's in the company's card

19
00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.940
There are sixty dollars

20
00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:27.880
These two cards cost more than seventy yuan

21
00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.200
Not at all like you

22
00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.360
Ha ha ha ha
