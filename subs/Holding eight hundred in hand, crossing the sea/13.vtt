00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:03.640
It turned out to be a real East China Sea leaf spirit pig.

2
00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:05.860
Pretend to hold on to the tens of millions of Donghai Yelingzhu.

3
00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:08.340
Old man, this is such a good thing.

4
00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:10.000
Chef boss, don’t look away.

5
00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:12.560
There is no way this piece of trash can come up with tens of millions.

6
00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:14.800
Do you doubt my vision?

7
00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:18.160
I don't dare, it's just that this broken pig can't be so valuable.

8
00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.320
You do. The leaf spirit pig of the East China Sea calls for protection,

Mention rare. Don’t say tens of millions,

10
00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.080
Even 30 million is not too much.

11
00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.500
Wait, wait. explain,

12
00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:29.300
Bought. It was given by someone else.

13
00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:31.460
And before I walked around, I took my pulse,

14
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:33.800
Go look at that little bell

15
00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.380
I paid three cents. It’s too imaginary.

16
00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:39.420
I won I told you

17
00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.180
I'm looking for this to go to democracy and it's still the same

18
00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.040
I will give you a choice right now

19
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.780
Did you hear that? You really have a good eye.

20
00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.320

22
00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.020
Washing rack. Let’s write it alone.

23
00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:58.690
When will you, President Qiu, become a general director?

24
00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:02.910
It’s indeed popular.

25
00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:04.989
Since it belongs to Wealth Bank

26
00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.450
It's exactly what stupid people sell it.

27
00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:10.370
Since it is the treasure of Wealth Bank

28
00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:12.010
