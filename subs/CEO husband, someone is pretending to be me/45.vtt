1
00:00:05.166 --> 00:00:07.400
Didn't I ask for the long-life lock to be repaired?

2
00:00:07.533 --> 00:00:08.666
How could it be on him?

3
00:00:08.666 --> 00:00:09.600
It is said that

4
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.133
There are 3 pendants worth 10 million on the longevity lock.

5
00:00:12.133 --> 00:00:14.400
There are only two of these, can't they be fake?

6
00:00:14.533 --> 00:00:15.766
What do you know?

7
00:00:16.066 --> 00:00:18.333
The longevity lock was accidentally broken by my lock.

8
00:00:18.333 --> 00:00:19.900
It's being repaired now.

9
00:00:19.933 --> 00:00:22.366
This long-life lock is really top-level Youbo.

10
00:00:22.366 --> 00:00:24.533
Under the light, it will emit colorful light

11
00:00:24.533 --> 00:00:25.600
Little old man

12
00:00:25.733 --> 00:00:26.700
Why Longevity Lock

13
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:28.566
Will appear on this lady

14
00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:30.300
Could it be as he said

15
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.200
This Miss Song is Maoming's replacement

16
00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.066
The person I bumped into turned out to be Qiao Feng

17
00:00:37.133 --> 00:00:39.466
This finding is true

18
00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:41.966
But my granddaughter

19
00:00:42.133 --> 00:00:45.200
Definitely not such an arrogant and domineering woman

20
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.633
Why is my longevity lock on you?

21
00:00:47.666 --> 00:00:49.366
I heard you have a longevity lock

22
00:00:49.666 --> 00:00:50.833
You give him to me.

23
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:52.400
It's You

24
00:00:52.966 --> 00:00:55.166
Ah Yingying, you are so calculating

25
00:00:57.266 --> 00:00:59.233
The show is about to begin
