00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:01.866
Have you ever been exposed to high luxury?

2
00:00:01.866 --> 00:00:03.233
Dare to bark here

3
00:00:04.966 --> 00:00:06.833
Madam President's condition has improved

4
00:00:08.466 --> 00:00:10.666
If it is a high imitation, you will know if it is identified.

5
00:00:10.666 --> 00:00:12.366
Do you dare? Oh, right.

6
00:00:12.366 --> 00:00:15.033
I heard that Nangong Group will hold a charity dinner recently

7
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:17.266
I believe that Eun always has the ability

8
00:00:17.366 --> 00:00:19.700
Let us poor ghosts believe it when we see it

9
00:00:23.733 --> 00:00:26.166
I heard that this dinner party is all night street bosses

10
00:00:26.166 --> 00:00:27.700
Can we really go?

11
00:00:28.933 --> 00:00:31.533
Miss An is the CEO of Nangong Group

12
00:00:31.533 --> 00:00:32.833
But I'm not simple

13
00:00:38.066 --> 00:00:39.600
Damn Song Nianyi

14
00:00:41.133 --> 00:00:42.766
Yingying ah oops

15
00:00:43.166 --> 00:00:44.233
It's all your fault

16
00:00:44.466 --> 00:00:46.533
It must be because you are a lowly nanny

17
00:00:46.533 --> 00:00:48.433
That's why Brother Ye doesn't like me

18
00:00:48.466 --> 00:00:51.366
Yingying, you want to steal Nangong's luxury car

19
00:00:51.366 --> 00:00:52.866
Mom helped you

20
00:00:52.866 --> 00:00:56.066
Mom was fired by the Nangong family because of this

21
00:00:56.066 --> 00:00:59.466
But Young Master Nangong, we really can't afford it.

22
00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.400
Listen to your mother tell you

23
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.866
Let's not think about the rich or not

24
00:01:04.166 --> 00:01:07.466
We just need to find an ordinary person to live

25
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.333
Mom, this young man is pretty good

26
00:01:10.333 --> 00:01:11.866
Mom, shut up

27
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.533
Do you want me to be like you?

28
00:01:13.533 --> 00:01:15.666
Be a lowly nanny for the rest of your life?

29
00:01:16.733 --> 00:01:18.733
And the original sounding shoes

30
00:01:18.733 --> 00:01:19.866
I didn't even settle the score with him

31
00:01:19.866 --> 00:01:20.666
scram

32
00:01:21.566 --> 00:01:23.066
How was the situation in the middle of the night?

33
00:01:23.133 --> 00:01:25.066
The doctor said there was blood in the CEO's head

34
00:01:25.066 --> 00:01:26.433
Just spread it out

35
00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:28.400
When can we expect to see it?

36
00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:30.966
The doctor said in about three days

37
00:01:30.966 --> 00:01:33.166
Then I won't be able to attend the charity dinner.

38
00:01:33.366 --> 00:01:34.700
How's the investigation on the car accident?

39
00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.900
Surrounding surveillance has been sabotaged

40
00:01:36.966 --> 00:01:39.233
Auntie, who are you offending?

41
00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:40.566
The tree attracts the wind

42
00:01:40.566 --> 00:01:42.766
Nangong Group has developed too fast in the past millennium

43
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:43.933
be jealous

44
00:01:43.933 --> 00:01:46.166
The president has encountered a lot of intentional injuries to him this year

45
00:01:46.166 --> 00:01:48.400
I'm afraid you're worried and didn't let us tell you.

46
00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.000
Fortunately, the president specially distributed it.

47
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.966
If something happens to him, you are the head of the group

48
00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:56.700
aunt

49
00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.600
I will definitely guard the Nangong Group for you
