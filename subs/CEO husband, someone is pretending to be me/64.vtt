1
00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:02.866
Looks like the contract is signed

2
00:00:02.866 --> 00:00:03.800
So happy

3
00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:06.166
Thank you for getting off Mr. Li's bed

4
00:00:06.166 --> 00:00:07.333
As expected of my sister-in-law

5
00:00:07.333 --> 00:00:09.366
It's a good way to serve men

6
00:00:09.366 --> 00:00:11.600
They still don't know that An Yingni has been exposed

7
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:14.500
So I can take the opportunity to rescue some more poison

8
00:00:14.966 --> 00:00:15.700
What contract to sign

9
00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:16.966
Pardon me?

10
00:00:17.966 --> 00:00:19.900
Supreme is our old partner

11
00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.000
How could you have messed up such an important thing?

12
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.800
Didn't you read the hot search?

13
00:00:23.966 --> 00:00:25.700
Supreme has been seized.

14
00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.533
Seized Fashion Seized

15
00:00:28.533 --> 00:00:29.833
Just started

16
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.566
Yes very fearless

17
00:00:31.566 --> 00:00:33.300
This holy group has really been seized

18
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.900
It is said to be suspected of illegal transactions

19
00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:36.966
Well, anyway.

20
00:00:36.966 --> 00:00:39.033
This is all your fault.

21
00:00:39.333 --> 00:00:40.966
Just because you're the CEO

22
00:00:40.966 --> 00:00:42.266
I don't know your sin

23
00:00:42.266 --> 00:00:43.566
It's my fault too

24
00:00:43.666 --> 00:00:44.300
Already knew

25
00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.300
IQ is not a reliable partner

26
00:00:46.533 --> 00:00:48.500
This is Jon Shangpin's contract list

27
00:00:48.733 --> 00:00:50.466
This is more reliable than IQ

28
00:00:50.933 --> 00:00:54.466
Jon Shangpin belongs to Joe's, the richest man in the country

29
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.866
You lie and don't look for the horizon

30
00:00:56.866 --> 00:00:58.700
See what level you are at

31
00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:02.700
This is George's official seal

32
00:01:03.066 --> 00:01:04.866
Or something at headquarters?

33
00:01:07.933 --> 00:01:10.433
It's just a fake official seal put on

34
00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.066
Do you really believe

35
00:01:12.066 --> 00:01:12.866
Humph

36
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.200
This bumpkin can still reach the bridge city

37
00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:17.833
Littering other people's things

38
00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:19.433
You're not afraid I'll fire you?

39
00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:21.700
expel

40
00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.200
Today, the group is going to airborne an inspector general

41
00:01:25.266 --> 00:01:27.400
That belongs to the board of directors

42
00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.133
You messed up the peace-first project.

43
00:01:29.133 --> 00:01:31.666
I think it's you who can't protect yourself

44
00:01:31.666 --> 00:01:33.100
You dare to forge a contract

45
00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:34.766
As soon as the new director arrives

46
00:01:34.766 --> 00:01:36.533
See the board disdains to take your position

47
00:01:36.533 --> 00:01:39.200
Who dares to forge a contract under my nose
