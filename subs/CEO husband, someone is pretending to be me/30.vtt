00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:09.733
President Song has lost his memory

2
00:00:09.733 --> 00:00:11.466
Many workers have forgotten

3
00:00:11.466 --> 00:00:13.466
Mr. Song is actually the CEO appointed by the president

4
00:00:13.466 --> 00:00:15.266
Your opinion is the opinion of the president

5
00:00:16.066 --> 00:00:18.200
It seems that the president's little trick is about to be worn out

6
00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:19.633
I have to get away from normal

7
00:00:21.133 --> 00:00:23.700
Hey, Mr. Song, since you have work to talk about

8
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:25.400
I'm going to make a pot of hot tea for everyone first

9
00:00:26.333 --> 00:00:27.133
Lite column

10
00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.066
Tea can't afford

11
00:00:29.066 --> 00:00:30.433
You have to do it.

12
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:31.866
Now I have amnesia

13
00:00:31.866 --> 00:00:33.566
I also hope that Li Tezhu will stay

14
00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:34.766
Give some pointers

15
00:00:35.466 --> 00:00:36.266
Uh uh

16
00:00:40.733 --> 00:00:41.533
Li Te Zhu

17
00:00:42.333 --> 00:00:44.866
What you just said about me means the president

18
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.900
Then I'll let you make a pot of tea

19
00:00:46.933 --> 00:00:48.166
Is that okay?

20
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:51.733
Fairy fight

21
00:00:51.733 --> 00:00:52.566
mortal fly

22
00:00:52.733 --> 00:00:53.833
The heart is destroyed

23
00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:59.400
Outsiders are gone

24
00:00:59.666 --> 00:01:01.500
Now it's time to talk about what happened between us

25
00:01:05.733 --> 00:01:07.300
Your teacup is empty

26
00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:08.833
What water to drink

27
00:01:10.066 --> 00:01:11.766
Or are you nervous?

28
00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.000
Nervous, you are not disappointed at all

29
00:01:15.766 --> 00:01:16.566
Ah!

30
00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.566
Joe? I don't know what you mean.

31
00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.066
Uh, Miss Song

32
00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.333
If you talk about things other than work

33
00:01:24.333 --> 00:01:26.900
I don't think we need to talk anymore

34
00:01:37.966 --> 00:01:38.900
No need.
