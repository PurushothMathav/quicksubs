00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:03.866
Madam, you also understand the situation of the president

2
00:00:03.866 --> 00:00:06.633
It is indeed amnesia, how can I restore my memory?

3
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:10.500
Doctor says CEO needs proper emotional stimulation

4
00:00:10.566 --> 00:00:12.566
But the old lady is afraid that the president will have another accident.

5
00:00:12.566 --> 00:00:13.633
Just refused

6
00:00:14.133 --> 00:00:15.833
emotional stimulation

7
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:19.966
Auntie, I will definitely restore your memory.

8
00:00:19.966 --> 00:00:20.800
Wait for me.

9
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.200
If the lady knows that the president is decorating

10
00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.633
Can the president say

11
00:00:32.966 --> 00:00:35.366
It seems that someone needs to re-investigate.

12
00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.000
What kind of emotion can stimulate the answer?

13
00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:56.466
Happy Holidays

14
00:00:59.166 --> 00:01:00.466
I am very fortunate

15
00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:03.800
On that starry night

16
00:01:04.666 --> 00:01:05.800
Met you

17
00:01:06.966 --> 00:01:08.033
Do you remember

18
00:01:13.333 --> 00:01:14.900
Starry night

19
00:01:15.666 --> 00:01:16.966
No, now.

20
00:01:28.566 --> 00:01:30.800
Wait until we cook the raw rice into cooked rice

21
00:01:31.466 --> 00:01:33.566
See how you refuse me

22
00:01:41.466 --> 00:01:43.033
It's Brother Ye's phone.

23
00:01:47.366 --> 00:01:49.500
Auntie, the stars are beautiful tonight

24
00:01:49.533 --> 00:01:51.633
I was at the news park gate where we first met you

25
00:01:51.966 --> 00:01:53.500
Help you recover your lost memories

26
00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.433
Song Nianyi, you sent it to your door yourself
