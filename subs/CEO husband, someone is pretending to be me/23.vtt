00:00:04.866 --> 00:00:05.666
Where to go?

2
00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:08.566
Go to the hospital for memory recovery training

3
00:00:09.266 --> 00:00:10.066
aunt

4
00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:12.166
Yingying told me yesterday

5
00:00:12.166 --> 00:00:14.866
You made Song Nianyi the CEO of the company

6
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.066
I don't agree with that.

7
00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:18.800
A gold digger

8
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.900
How can you manage a large group well?

9
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:23.800
When you come back

10
00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.133
Remove him from his position

11
00:00:25.133 --> 00:00:26.033
Exchange Yingying reward

12
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.333
Song Nianyi's performance

13
00:00:28.333 --> 00:00:30.233
The whole group is there for all to see

14
00:00:30.733 --> 00:00:33.666
The project of the richest man in Jade Dragon City was also won by him

15
00:00:33.733 --> 00:00:35.000
I don't think the whole group

16
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.100
There is a second person as smart as him

17
00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:38.000
Nice.

18
00:00:38.766 --> 00:00:41.266
Mom, you have been out of the group for many years

19
00:00:41.266 --> 00:00:43.466
Don't get involved in this matter?

20
00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.033
Did I misread Grandpa Song?

21
00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:50.100
Grandpa Song, I want to see what he is capable of

22
00:00:53.566 --> 00:00:55.166
Hey Yingying

23
00:00:55.733 --> 00:00:57.566
Don't touch your feet

24
00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.400
I am now the wife of the president

25
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.100
What if someone gets caught on camera?

26
00:01:01.133 --> 00:01:01.933
Yingying

27
00:01:02.333 --> 00:01:04.500
So I heard you're pregnant.

28
00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:05.866
Is it mine?

29
00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:07.400
So what if it's yours?

30
00:01:07.533 --> 00:01:09.300
You poor man, can you afford it?

31
00:01:09.866 --> 00:01:11.533
The child belongs to Nangong Ye

32
00:01:11.533 --> 00:01:13.600
That is the young master of Nangong Group

33
00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.266
I want to follow you as much as possible

34
00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.400
Is it possible to be a repairman for the rest of your life?

35
00:01:19.566 --> 00:01:21.233
Nangong Night Nangong Night

36
00:01:21.733 --> 00:01:23.166
All afraid sons

37
00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.000
Why is he desperate?

38
00:01:25.266 --> 00:01:27.966
You said they were going to give me all mine back

39
00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:30.500
Have you seen this man?

40
00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.000
Longevity lock

41
00:01:34.133 --> 00:01:37.633
20 years ago, Qiao Wangfeng, the richest man in the country, made a lot of money to find his granddaughter

42
00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.100
This is trust me

43
00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:42.700
That is to say

44
00:01:42.766 --> 00:01:44.800
Song Nianyi is not an orphan

45
00:01:44.966 --> 00:01:47.433
He is the lost granddaughter of the richest man in the country

46
00:01:49.566 --> 00:01:50.700
Hey Yoyo
