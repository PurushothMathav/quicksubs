1
00:00:00.533 --> 00:00:02.066
I wanted to retrieve monitoring

2
00:00:02.133 --> 00:00:04.233
I didn't expect you to take the initiative to show your own feet

3
00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:05.466
The project you leaked says

4
00:00:05.466 --> 00:00:07.533
It is not the core data of this project at all

5
00:00:07.533 --> 00:00:09.200
But I did it specifically to lure you into the bait

6
00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:10.500
Prepared invalid documents

7
00:00:10.866 --> 00:00:11.333
recent

8
00:00:11.333 --> 00:00:13.966
The group's large and small data has been leaked several times

9
00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:16.833
I especially take this opportunity to invite you into your dream

10
00:00:17.133 --> 00:00:18.700
Sure enough, it blew you up

11
00:00:22.066 --> 00:00:23.700
I'm sorry, give me another chance.

12
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:25.000
I didn't mean to.

13
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.666
I was blind to Mount Tai before

14
00:00:26.666 --> 00:00:27.866
If you fire me

15
00:00:27.866 --> 00:00:30.066
I have no place in Jingzhou

16
00:00:30.066 --> 00:00:31.300
Mr. Song, I beg you

17
00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:32.733
Please give me another chance.

18
00:00:32.733 --> 00:00:34.400
I really know I was wrong.

19
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.533
It's okay not to get fired

20
00:00:37.533 --> 00:00:38.966
But only if

21
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.233
You're going to tell me who's behind it

22
00:00:50.066 --> 00:00:53.266
Is it good to be behind the scenes?

23
00:00:53.333 --> 00:00:55.766
So it was you who betrayed the group?

24
00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.400
Do you know

25
00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.533
If you offend the Nangong family

26
00:00:59.533 --> 00:01:01.400
You have no way out in Zhengzhou

27
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:02.566
I'm obsessed

28
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:03.900
I did it all.

29
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.400
Your company gave me a great show today

30
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.100
But I don't care which of you goes first.

31
00:01:13.366 --> 00:01:15.766
I can't see the final project book today.

32
00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.200
Just 15 billion liquidated damages

33
00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:21.600
15 billion that's the stubbornness of the entire Nangong Group

34
00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.800
Why so many days to build a project book

35
00:01:25.266 --> 00:01:26.666
Mr. Long is afraid that he will be disappointed

36
00:01:26.666 --> 00:01:29.000
The real project book was admitted to the USB stick by me

37
00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:49.500
How could this be?

38
00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.000
Haha, Song Nianyi

39
00:01:52.066 --> 00:01:55.166
You offended a lot of people, haha.
