00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.266
Hey intern

2
00:00:21.366 --> 00:00:24.766
Go get Mr. An a cup of coffee to grind by hand

3
00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:26.800
I'm here to work.

4
00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.466
I'm not here to serve tea and water

5
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.066
Letting you grind coffee is your blessing

6
00:00:33.066 --> 00:00:35.066
Don't toast the drinker is a punishment

7
00:00:35.066 --> 00:00:36.066
Do you believe it or not?

8
00:00:36.066 --> 00:00:39.233
Mr. An can get you out of the company with the snap of a finger

9
00:00:40.733 --> 00:00:43.266
Calm down is not the time to be exposed

10
00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:44.366
The identity of the intern

11
00:00:44.366 --> 00:00:46.166
To get the truest news

12
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:55.700
grandma

13
00:00:55.966 --> 00:00:58.666
How dare you give Mr. An this coffee

14
00:00:58.666 --> 00:00:59.966
Everyone else can drink

15
00:01:00.066 --> 00:01:03.866
What do you mean, Director An is not a human being?

16
00:01:15.266 --> 00:01:16.966
Oh, dear.

17
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.233
My shoes!

18
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.033
How did that happen?

19
00:01:20.066 --> 00:01:22.533
Bitch, this is a limited edition Gucci.

20
00:01:22.533 --> 00:01:25.166
Do you know how expensive he is?

21
00:01:26.933 --> 00:01:28.866
As for your style and material workmanship.

22
00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.166
Even high imitation can't compare to him

23
00:01:31.366 --> 00:01:33.133
How dare you insult the CEO

24
00:01:33.133 --> 00:01:35.466
I think you should leave as soon as possible

25
00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:36.700
leave

26
00:01:37.466 --> 00:01:39.000
The CEO

27
00:01:39.733 --> 00:01:41.300
He really has the patience to let me go

28
00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.433
Scared

29
00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.200
As long as you get down on your knees and wipe my shoes clean

30
00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.066
Three more kowtows

31
00:01:48.066 --> 00:01:50.033
I can open later

32
00:01:54.933 --> 00:01:56.666
This is how I apologize

33
00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:59.566
The balance in this card

34
00:01:59.566 --> 00:02:01.633
Buy more than 100 pairs of high-quality imitations like you.

35
00:02:02.133 --> 00:02:04.100
Next time, I will buy a better quality one.

36
00:02:04.366 --> 00:02:07.166
Your heels are worn off

37
00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.066
What did you say about Mr. An's scorpion? It turned out to be a high imitation.

38
00:02:11.066 --> 00:02:12.400
Really faded

39
00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.500
This material is not real at first glance.
