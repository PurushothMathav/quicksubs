00:00:02.866 --> 00:00:04.966
Grandpa, I'm back.

2
00:00:05.466 --> 00:00:06.700
I brought a friend by the way

3
00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.466
Oh Nian Nian

4
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.100
Grandpa hurry hurry hurry

5
00:00:13.533 --> 00:00:15.066
Go, go, go, you know

6
00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:16.800
get to know

7
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:18.433
Oops Nian Nian

8
00:00:18.533 --> 00:00:20.233
Are you hungry so late?

9
00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:24.300
I'll ask the new Ann to cook a bowl of noodles for you

10
00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:25.500
And he was right.

11
00:00:25.733 --> 00:00:27.200
You helped me last time.

12
00:00:27.333 --> 00:00:28.966
I haven't apologized to you in person yet.

13
00:00:28.966 --> 00:00:30.033
Don't bother.

14
00:00:30.133 --> 00:00:31.766
Grandpa, I also want to thank you.

15
00:00:31.766 --> 00:00:33.300
Tonight if not

16
00:00:34.533 --> 00:00:36.300
Qiao Yancheng, yes

17
00:00:36.333 --> 00:00:37.533
If it weren't for Qiao Yancheng tonight

18
00:00:37.533 --> 00:00:40.033
Sir, my life may be on the line

19
00:00:40.666 --> 00:00:42.000
Life on the line

20
00:00:43.566 --> 00:00:44.466
Qiao Yancheng

21
00:00:45.666 --> 00:00:48.200
Qiao Yancheng, the richest man in the country

22
00:00:49.266 --> 00:00:51.500
It's fine, it's fine

23
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.200
Grandpa!

24
00:00:53.466 --> 00:00:56.233
Do you also think he misses you like someone?

25
00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:58.600
Ah!

26
00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.166
It's okay, you heard me, I don't mean it.

27
00:01:02.466 --> 00:01:03.366
I just think you are special

28
00:01:03.366 --> 00:01:06.233
Like my lost sister of over 20 years

29
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.433
Every year, I have something to ask you

30
00:01:09.766 --> 00:01:13.400
Do you have a golden longevity lock on you?

31
00:01:14.366 --> 00:01:16.800
Yes. How do you know that?

32
00:01:17.133 --> 00:01:19.866
My long-life lock is still engraved with a face.

33
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.800
Ouch, I knew it. You must be my granddaughter.

34
00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.500
I made that longevity lock myself.

35
00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.700
That face is knocked by me

36
00:01:31.133 --> 00:01:32.433
I keep it.

37
00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.100
You are really my grandfather

38
00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:42.700
every year

39
00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:46.800
So many years

40
00:01:47.366 --> 00:01:48.866
You suffered.

41
00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.566
I'm going to prepare a grand return banquet

42
00:01:54.133 --> 00:01:55.600
To tell the world

43
00:01:55.866 --> 00:01:57.966
My granddaughter has found out

44
00:02:03.266 --> 00:02:04.066
younger sister

45
00:02:04.466 --> 00:02:05.766
You haven't been here for 20 years

46
00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.733
Brother will prepare gifts for you every year.

47
00:02:07.733 --> 00:02:10.400
I won't miss every birthday of yours in the future.

48
00:02:12.066 --> 00:02:12.866
circle

49
00:02:14.533 --> 00:02:17.166
Hahaha

50
00:02:28.733 --> 00:02:31.633
If only my Yingying were so sensible
