00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.900
Wonseong, why did you kidnap me?

2
00:00:02.933 --> 00:00:04.566
Are you going to break the agreement?

3
00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:06.666
promise

4
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.400
You broke it first.

5
00:00:10.466 --> 00:00:12.500
It's you who made Yingying look like this now

6
00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.233
Yes, Yingying wants to pretend to be Mrs. Nangong herself

7
00:00:15.366 --> 00:00:17.466
I have reminded him many times

8
00:00:17.533 --> 00:00:18.900
His situation today

9
00:00:19.066 --> 00:00:21.366
All because of his own vanity

10
00:00:21.366 --> 00:00:24.366
You're talking nonsense if you don't hide your identity

11
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.300
How could Yingying pretend to be

12
00:00:26.333 --> 00:00:27.700
How could it be exposed?

13
00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:30.233
I see.

14
00:00:31.133 --> 00:00:32.566
I know you look down on me

15
00:00:33.333 --> 00:00:34.500
But you know

16
00:00:35.333 --> 00:00:37.066
Because his mother is just a nanny

17
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.733
How much does it cost to become a better person?

18
00:00:39.733 --> 00:00:42.266
You just move your fingers.

19
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:43.900
Nangong Ye and Qiao Wangfeng

20
00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:45.300
We will strive for everything

21
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.800
All delivered to you

22
00:00:47.133 --> 00:00:48.566
What you call effort

23
00:00:48.966 --> 00:00:51.200
Isn't it just hurting others and replacing others?

24
00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.066
You are such a crime against others and yourself

25
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.466
It is also worthy of mentioning the word hard work.

26
00:00:56.966 --> 00:00:58.566
You are less proud

27
00:00:58.566 --> 00:01:00.133
Do you think Nangong Yue really loves you?

28
00:01:00.133 --> 00:01:02.533
Ah, he just took a fancy to your richest man.

29
00:01:02.533 --> 00:01:03.833
It's just a daughter's identity

30
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.966
Why else would I see you humiliated like that?

31
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.866
I have to wait until you restore your identity as a daughter

32
00:01:07.866 --> 00:01:08.800
Dare to recognize you

33
00:01:10.766 --> 00:01:11.566
miss

34
00:01:13.466 --> 00:01:14.833
Don't come here

35
00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:18.400
OK

36
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.366
I will not go

37
00:01:20.866 --> 00:01:21.800
Don't be impulsive

38
00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:23.500
Don't be impulsive

39
00:01:25.766 --> 00:01:26.600
Nangong banquet

40
00:01:28.133 --> 00:01:30.100
Who will transfer the shares to 1,000 immediately?

41
00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.766
Song Nian Yi's director has already pressed it, but you are missing.

42
00:01:38.566 --> 00:01:41.166
Didn't you say he was the most important person to you? Gun

43
00:01:42.666 --> 00:01:44.166
Show me the gun
