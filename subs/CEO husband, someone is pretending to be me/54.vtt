00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:08.800
Doctor, how is my grandfather?

2
00:00:09.166 --> 00:00:10.866
The patient has been suffering from this problem for more than 20 years

3
00:00:10.866 --> 00:00:13.300
Suture surgery is now necessary

4
00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:14.866
But the patient's too old.

5
00:00:14.866 --> 00:00:16.266
There is a great risk of cerebral infarction

6
00:00:17.066 --> 00:00:18.100
Our level is limited

7
00:00:18.166 --> 00:00:19.500
You'd better send the patient quickly

8
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.000
Go abroad for treatment

9
00:00:25.566 --> 00:00:27.266
If I hadn't been in love with my grandfather

10
00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:29.800
Grandpa's illness will not suddenly recur

11
00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:31.200
Okay, okay.

12
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.400
Remember not to blame

13
00:00:33.666 --> 00:00:34.500
It has nothing to do with you.

14
00:00:35.966 --> 00:00:37.500
I have contacted the private jet

15
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:38.766
Immediately send grandpa abroad for treatment

16
00:00:39.766 --> 00:00:41.433
Grandpa is so happy to find you

17
00:00:41.466 --> 00:00:42.400
How can there be business?

18
00:00:42.566 --> 00:00:44.233
Right every year?

19
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:45.266
When I was little

20
00:00:45.266 --> 00:00:47.300
You just follow your brother's butt and call your brother.

21
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.466
Why don't you call me brother when you grow up?

22
00:00:50.666 --> 00:00:51.666
Sorry.

23
00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:58.866
It's okay, I know you can't get used to it yet.

24
00:00:59.533 --> 00:01:01.800
In the future, brother will see more about you, okay?

25
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.566
Otherwise, I'm afraid you'll forget me

26
00:01:06.333 --> 00:01:08.333
Okay, the plane is coming

27
00:01:08.333 --> 00:01:10.600
We have to hurry up and transfer grandpa

28
00:01:13.566 --> 00:01:14.366
Come on.

29
00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:16.600
Grandpa

30
00:01:17.733 --> 00:01:18.533
every year

31
00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:20.633
I know you have a lot of responsibilities on you right now

32
00:01:20.733 --> 00:01:22.500
Let my brother accompany my grandfather, okay?

33
00:01:23.166 --> 00:01:24.366
My sister is a strong woman

34
00:01:24.366 --> 00:01:26.766
You can handle things well without a brother.

35
00:01:26.766 --> 00:01:27.566
Right?

36
00:01:29.566 --> 00:01:31.633
This is the staff of the head of the Qiao family.

37
00:01:32.366 --> 00:01:34.466
You can control all the forces of the Qiao family in the country

38
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.233
Let him replace grandpa and brother

39
00:01:45.766 --> 00:01:47.766
That's what it's like to have family.

40
00:01:49.466 --> 00:01:52.200
Brother, I'll be here waiting for you to come back.

41
00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:56.200
Who are you calling brother?
