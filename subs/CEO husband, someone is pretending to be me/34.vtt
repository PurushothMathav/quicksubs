00:00:01.933 --> 00:00:03.433
Eat more celery

2
00:00:03.933 --> 00:00:05.633
You see you have lost weight

3
00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:07.600
Eat more celery

4
00:00:07.966 --> 00:00:11.066
I'm not like some people who only know how to eat

5
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:13.633
I will only feel sorry for my brother.

6
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.633
Xiaoye has been serious about couples since he was a child

7
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.200
An Ying, you haven't eaten since you've been married for more than a year

8
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:26.200
Does Auntie remember being allergic to celery?

9
00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:30.233
Don't eat it

10
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:31.766
You swear

11
00:00:31.866 --> 00:00:33.766
Did you forget about your allergy to celery?

12
00:00:33.766 --> 00:00:34.566
Oh.

13
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.066
Anyone?

14
00:00:36.733 --> 00:00:37.700
I don't remember.

15
00:00:41.166 --> 00:00:43.366
Oh brother Ye

16
00:00:43.366 --> 00:00:44.966
You see it's all my fault

17
00:00:45.666 --> 00:00:49.000
The doctor said that eating more celery is good for the baby

18
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.700
You see I just think about the baby

19
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.266
Forgot about this

20
00:00:52.266 --> 00:00:53.066
forget

21
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.700
Did you know that moderate allergies can cause shock?

22
00:00:56.066 --> 00:00:57.500
You can even forget this

23
00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.766
It's hard not to question the authenticity of your identity

24
00:01:00.333 --> 00:01:01.200
Oh, no.

25
00:01:01.266 --> 00:01:03.966
This dead old woman shouldn't be suspicious, right?

26
00:01:04.666 --> 00:01:06.300
Am I the president's wife?

27
00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:08.166
I don't need you to judge

28
00:01:08.166 --> 00:01:09.400
Don't you forget.

29
00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.333
The identity of the counterfeit was exposed

30
00:01:12.333 --> 00:01:15.266
Why do you want to do it again now?

31
00:01:19.933 --> 00:01:23.000
Sorry baby mom

32
00:01:23.066 --> 00:01:26.866
Mom can't stop those bad women from robbing you of dad

33
00:01:27.066 --> 00:01:29.833
Hmm don't go on

34
00:01:29.866 --> 00:01:31.566
Otherwise, I can't explain it later.

35
00:01:32.366 --> 00:01:33.233
That's enough!
