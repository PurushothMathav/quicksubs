00:00:00.866 --> 00:00:02.533
Brother Ye, why are you here?

2
00:00:02.533 --> 00:00:03.566
I will never come again

3
00:00:03.566 --> 00:00:06.466
You're going to hire my highly paid CEO

4
00:00:06.533 --> 00:00:09.166
Isn't it amnesia to go out and stay up late?

5
00:00:09.166 --> 00:00:11.066
How do you remember the CEO?

6
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.066
President, are you mistaken?

7
00:00:19.066 --> 00:00:21.133
It's not Miss Ann we're driving away

8
00:00:21.133 --> 00:00:23.466
It's this bitch pretending to be Miss An

9
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.500
Nianyi Song graduated from Harvard Business School

10
00:00:32.933 --> 00:00:35.033
Worked at Wall Street Investment for a year

11
00:00:35.266 --> 00:00:37.400
It was Nangong Group who spent the annual salary. Please

12
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:38.500
CEO

13
00:00:39.066 --> 00:00:41.066
During this time of my cultivation

14
00:00:41.133 --> 00:00:44.266
He is fully responsible for all affairs of Nangong Group

15
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.200
The only CEO is Song Mingyi

16
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.333
In Nangong Group, it has always only been about ability

17
00:00:50.333 --> 00:00:52.833
Don't talk about group loan relationships

18
00:00:53.133 --> 00:00:54.766
When have I been to Jianghu?

19
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.766
Okay, your Song Ning is really a thief. Action

20
00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.800
He still wants to seduce his father and the dog

21
00:01:01.466 --> 00:01:03.200
It turned out that Lord Li did it for me

22
00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.400
Brother Ye, he bullied me like that just now

23
00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.600
Is this the end of the matter?

24
00:01:11.966 --> 00:01:13.600
The surveillance is always recording

25
00:01:13.966 --> 00:01:17.666
My mom doesn't like snarky daughters-in-law
