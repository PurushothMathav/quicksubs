00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:01.866
I give you two options.

2
00:00:01.866 --> 00:00:04.300
One is kneel down with me and kowtow three times

3
00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:04.933
What about two?

4
00:00:04.933 --> 00:00:07.866
Just take your stuff and get out of the company immediately

5
00:00:07.933 --> 00:00:10.633
Otherwise you are like this pen

6
00:00:13.266 --> 00:00:15.200
Dead without a burial

7
00:00:17.366 --> 00:00:19.933
My God, this pen is Master Erdi's luminous light

8
00:00:19.933 --> 00:00:21.400
What luminous light?

9
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.433
It's just a cheap product bought at a 2 yuan store.

10
00:00:24.666 --> 00:00:26.366
Mr. An is really luminous

11
00:00:26.366 --> 00:00:28.600
The luminous ink will turn red when it encounters air

12
00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:29.500
And this pen

13
00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.933
It was sold to Mystery Buy for $50 million at the time.

14
00:00:31.933 --> 00:00:34.666
This ink bag is worth 2 million

15
00:00:34.666 --> 00:00:36.366
Mr. An is so confused

16
00:00:36.366 --> 00:00:38.433
What a pity, what luminous light?

17
00:00:38.533 --> 00:00:41.733
But it's just a counterfeit of CC9 yuan 9 free shipping.

18
00:00:41.733 --> 00:00:43.600
Only a fool would be fooled

19
00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.566
You actually ruined the token of love between me and Aye

20
00:00:46.966 --> 00:00:48.600
Ouch, enough is enough for you.

21
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.700
I should be telling you this sentence, right?

22
00:00:50.766 --> 00:00:52.100
What a token of love?

23
00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.333
Just a little mistress who sells himself for glory

24
00:00:54.333 --> 00:00:56.333
I like to wear counterfeits

25
00:00:56.333 --> 00:00:57.066
If so

26
00:00:57.066 --> 00:00:58.466
I'll help you decide.

27
00:00:58.466 --> 00:00:59.733
Within 3 minutes

28
00:00:59.733 --> 00:01:02.600
Take your luggage and get out of the company immediately

29
00:01:03.766 --> 00:01:05.200
Hahaha

30
00:01:05.766 --> 00:01:07.500
It seems that I still can't bear to die

31
00:01:09.366 --> 00:01:11.000
How dare you push the president's wife

32
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.300
Apologize to the lady quickly

33
00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:17.300
Ah!

34
00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.466
It's everywhere. I'm sorry.

35
00:01:19.466 --> 00:01:20.066
What's wrong with me?

36
00:01:20.066 --> 00:01:21.500
What are you standing there for?

37
00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.700
Quickly kick this crazy woman out of the company for me

38
00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.233
I'll see who dares to touch her
