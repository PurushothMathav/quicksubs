1
00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:02.666
Madam President, you are here at the right time

2
00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:03.700
I want to report

3
00:00:03.933 --> 00:00:06.433
The CEO forged the contract to avoid responsibility

4
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:08.966
They don't know what's going on at the State Department yet

5
00:00:08.966 --> 00:00:09.966
That would be fine.

6
00:00:09.966 --> 00:00:12.033
I was about to become the real president

7
00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:13.700
How dare you come to the company?

8
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.000
Aren't you afraid that I will expose your lies again?

9
00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:19.766
Song Nian still dared to talk back when she was about to die

10
00:00:19.766 --> 00:00:22.600
Wang Jia, didn't you get fired?

11
00:00:24.466 --> 00:00:27.233
This is a letter of recommendation written by Mrs. Yin

12
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.133
Madam Yin is the founder of Nangong Group

13
00:00:30.133 --> 00:00:31.133
Also a major shareholder

14
00:00:31.133 --> 00:00:34.500
It has more power than you, the appointed president

15
00:00:35.533 --> 00:00:37.100
The kind that grandma officially plays

16
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.466
Doesn't he know that my actor is a fake?

17
00:00:39.566 --> 00:00:42.900
I didn't expect the president's wife to be the new director

18
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.500
Or because the old lady appointed it herself

19
00:00:45.533 --> 00:00:48.733
This is much more advanced than some mistress who comes in through relationships

20
00:00:48.733 --> 00:00:49.533
Now.

21
00:00:53.266 --> 00:00:55.900
I remember you were fired, right?

22
00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:57.666
But now I'm Director Ann

23
00:00:57.666 --> 00:01:00.400
The newly appointed deputy director?

24
00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:01.900
You just left?

25
00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:03.833
What about the forgery of the contract?
