00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:05.900
Hahahahaha, it's coming, hahaha stop.

2
00:00:11.533 --> 00:00:13.033
Speak quietly

3
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.633
Just no good days

4
00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:21.966
Not coming.

5
00:00:23.733 --> 00:00:24.533
I do not

6
00:00:24.766 --> 00:00:26.666
Does that mean you have controlled Nangong Ye?

7
00:00:26.666 --> 00:00:27.933
Did I see a ghost, grandma?

8
00:00:27.933 --> 00:00:29.466
How could Nangong Ye come over?

9
00:00:29.766 --> 00:00:31.133
You agreed to help me

10
00:00:31.133 --> 00:00:32.866
As a result, he even ran away in a low voice

11
00:00:33.966 --> 00:00:35.100
So what if you come?

12
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:36.900
You can catch them all in one go.

13
00:00:38.066 --> 00:00:39.866
Don't you hate sad nights the most?

14
00:00:40.133 --> 00:00:41.900
If he dies unexpectedly today

15
00:00:42.766 --> 00:00:44.700
You have no competition.

16
00:00:45.566 --> 00:00:46.933
What's coming at me?

17
00:00:46.933 --> 00:00:48.666
Hello Fang Guan

18
00:00:48.666 --> 00:00:50.366
A drama of a hero saving beauty

19
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.500
I'm about to cry

20
00:00:53.366 --> 00:00:54.633
Well, he can always.

21
00:00:55.066 --> 00:00:56.466
You kneel on the ground

22
00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:59.066
Give me three kowtows

23
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.900
You give me enough for the rest of my life

24
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.966
It's not a waste of pretending to be dead

25
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.233
What are you still doing?

26
00:01:08.166 --> 00:01:09.700
Who punched Nangong Yue?

27
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:10.966
I gave him 100,000

28
00:01:16.533 --> 00:01:18.666
For the rest of your life, you said that your aunt killed your mother

29
00:01:18.666 --> 00:01:19.700
What evidence do you have?

30
00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:21.600
evidence

31
00:01:23.933 --> 00:01:25.900
The name Nangong Sheng

32
00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:27.666
Is it enough?

33
00:01:28.866 --> 00:01:29.866
Nangong Sheng
