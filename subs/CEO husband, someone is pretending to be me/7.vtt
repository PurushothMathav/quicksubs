00:00:00.666 --> 00:00:01.466
Wow

2
00:00:02.566 --> 00:00:04.400
That's great, isn't it?

3
00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:06.666
Wow

4
00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:10.400
Can we really enter such a bizarre hall?

5
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.300
Fortunately, the native guy gave me an invitation

6
00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:14.833
Stole it

7
00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:17.633
That simp finally beat you a few times

8
00:00:17.766 --> 00:00:18.566
OK

9
00:00:19.066 --> 00:00:19.800
Hey

10
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.566
It is said that the words on this invitation letter are still pure gold

11
00:00:22.566 --> 00:00:24.200
Don't say gold

12
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.566
We, Mr. An, are the wife of the president

13
00:00:26.733 --> 00:00:30.000
Everything here belongs to Miss Ann

14
00:00:36.866 --> 00:00:39.500
Welcome to the charity dinner

15
00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:40.900
I'm the host.

16
00:00:41.166 --> 00:00:42.133
We have put

17
00:00:42.133 --> 00:00:45.166
All the items in this auction are displayed.

18
00:00:45.166 --> 00:00:46.100
Please choose

19
00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.266
Auction your favorite items

20
00:00:48.533 --> 00:00:51.100
The full amount received for this dinner

21
00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.133
It will be donated to the public welfare fund by Nangong Group

22
00:00:55.133 --> 00:00:56.133
This one in the middle

23
00:00:56.133 --> 00:00:58.633
But the crown that crowns the Queen of England

24
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.666
It's worth a billion dollars.

25
00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.000
It's a pity to use it for public welfare.

26
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.266
What a loss, Mr. En

27
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.433
Otherwise, how could we have seen such a scene?

28
00:01:10.966 --> 00:01:13.100
So temperamental, my god

29
00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.966
Song Nianyi, what is he doing here?

30
00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:37.866
Who is this guy?

31
00:01:37.866 --> 00:01:39.300
I have been in Nangong Group for so many years

32
00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:40.600
I've never seen such a beautiful woman

33
00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.300
That's a member of the board of directors of Nangong Group

34
00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:42.933
Only qualified to do

35
00:01:42.933 --> 00:01:45.533
I have long heard that President Nangong has returned for more than a year

36
00:01:45.533 --> 00:01:46.866
This charity dinner

37
00:01:46.966 --> 00:01:49.200
In fact, it was the president's wife who did it

38
00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.300
Is it him?

39
00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.433
Not this cheap

40
00:01:53.666 --> 00:01:55.300
You made me do this yourself.
