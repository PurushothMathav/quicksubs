00:00:07.933 --> 00:00:08.866
It's such a long way.

2
00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:10.900
Why hasn't Phoenix come so soon?

3
00:00:11.133 --> 00:00:12.966
This Mr. Song is really so powerful

4
00:00:13.133 --> 00:00:14.900
The president actually let the whole company pick up

5
00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:15.266
It is said that

6
00:00:15.266 --> 00:00:17.333
It was with his help that Nangong Group

7
00:00:17.333 --> 00:00:18.200
Bring the dead back to life

8

To become the richest man in Jingzhou

9
00:00:19.666 --> 00:00:20.900
He came to our company.

10
00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.200
It proves that we are not far from being developed

11
00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:24.433
Really so god

12
00:00:25.266 --> 00:00:27.500
Hey, big brother, I'm here, Mr. Song is here

13
00:00:30.166 --> 00:00:32.500
This pair of top luxury goods is limited to three pairs in the world.

14
00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.066
You can't necessarily buy it with money.

15
00:00:34.366 --> 00:00:37.300
The antique driver of the donkey brand, he actually used it to make hair rings

16
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.333
Mr. Song, we have prepared a place in Shanghai to come out.

17
00:00:43.333 --> 00:00:45.933
Mr. Wang, to make a long story short, I have seen your project

18
00:00:45.933 --> 00:00:47.066
Very promising.

19
00:00:47.166 --> 00:00:49.200
Longgong Group is willing to invest 1 billion

20
00:00:49.466 --> 00:00:50.433
This is the contract.

21
00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:51.800
If there is no problem.

22
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:52.866

23
00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:54.800
A billion is fine.

24
00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:55.900
Absolutely no problem.

25
00:00:58.133 --> 00:00:59.300
Hello husband and wife

26
00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:00.366
The CEO was in a car accident.

27
00:01:00.366 --> 00:01:01.700
I need you to come back and take charge

28
00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:03.666
What car accident?

29
00:01:04.666 --> 00:01:05.800
Hello ma'am

30
00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:07.033
Are you even listening?

31
00:01:13.133 --> 00:01:14.100
How could there be an accident?

32
00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.700
Madam, the president was going to hold a Shanghai banquet

33
00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.266
Officially introduce the lady to everyone

34
00:01:18.266 --> 00:01:19.666
I didn't expect my whereabouts to be leaked

35
00:01:19.666 --> 00:01:22.166
On the way, there were many malicious car accidents caused by other cars

36
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.966
I know the lady is tired of the workplace

37
00:01:23.966 --> 00:01:25.733
But Nangong Group is the brainchild of the president

38
00:01:25.733 --> 00:01:27.000
Can't be without a master for a day

39
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.200
Please also ask the lady to come out of the mountain

40
00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.500
Madam Nangong Group is leaderless

41
00:01:30.666 --> 00:01:32.866
Even though we blocked the CEO's injury

42
00:01:32.866 --> 00:01:34.500
But paper can't hold fire in the end

43
00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.100
If you are robbed by your opponent

44
00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:37.833
The group's stock market is bound to be hit hard

45
00:01:37.866 --> 00:01:39.900
Please come out of the mountain to take charge of the overall situation

46
00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.900
Please come out of the mountain to take charge of the overall situation

47
00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:51.600
OK

48
00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.066
No, I have to keep a low profile.

49
00:01:57.066 --> 00:01:58.500
Help him find the company manager

50
00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:14.700
Are you alright?

51
00:02:18.333 --> 00:02:19.766
You know me?
