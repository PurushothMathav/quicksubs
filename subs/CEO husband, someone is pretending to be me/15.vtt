00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:10.166
Come and see everyone

2
00:00:10.166 --> 00:00:12.433
This intern actually reported a big money

3
00:00:12.666 --> 00:00:13.800
It's a Bentley!

4
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:15.400
Millions.

5
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.566
This car gathers people to chat during working hours

6
00:00:18.566 --> 00:00:20.266
None of them want to do it, right?

7
00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:31.200
A broken Bentley gets so excited

8
00:00:31.266 --> 00:00:33.266
What a bunch of bumpkins

9
00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.166
Deposit Emperor Green Jade

10
00:00:37.166 --> 00:00:38.500
It's worth millions

11
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.666
Madam, is this true?

12
00:00:41.533 --> 00:00:42.933
You ignorant thing

13
00:00:42.933 --> 00:00:45.566
This is a gift from the old lady to the lady, and there can be fakes.

14
00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.866
I'm not like some mistress who meddles in other people's feelings

15
00:00:49.866 --> 00:00:53.200
Likes to interfere with other people's feelings with counterfeits

16
00:00:53.466 --> 00:00:55.833
Is it a noodle coat?

17
00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.400
Yo, this is not pretending to be the president's wife

18
00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:02.066
Then exposed on the spot

19
00:01:02.066 --> 00:01:03.966
Song Nianyi who fled?

20
00:01:03.966 --> 00:01:05.633
And face to the company

21
00:01:05.733 --> 00:01:07.466
So thick-skinned

22
00:01:08.333 --> 00:01:09.900
Let you jump around for a few days

23
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.266
Wait until you find out the content

24
00:01:11.266 --> 00:01:12.233
It's your ignorance

25
00:01:17.666 --> 00:01:18.900
What else do you want?

26
00:01:24.066 --> 00:01:25.033
What do you want?

27
00:01:25.966 --> 00:01:28.166
You offended the president's wife last night

28
00:01:28.166 --> 00:01:30.633
You don't think this is going to go away.
