00:00:02.333 --> 00:00:05.066
What CEO is coming?

2
00:00:05.533 --> 00:00:08.000
Ah ok ok I'll get ready now

3
00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:09.766
Everybody put down what they were doing.

4
00:00:09.766 --> 00:00:12.000
Now go downstairs to meet the CEO

5
00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:16.533
Hey, did you hear?

6
00:00:16.533 --> 00:00:18.600
This group is especially in the CEO

7
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.200
It seems to be a woman

8
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:21.933
I remember there was a rumor that

9
00:00:21.933 --> 00:00:23.700
Our CEO is already married

10
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:26.033
Is this the wife of the president?

11
00:00:26.666 --> 00:00:29.233
Take this opportunity to inspect our

12
00:00:29.766 --> 00:00:31.000
Mrs. President

13
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.533
Wouldn't that be better?

14
00:00:32.533 --> 00:00:36.300
We're ready for the promotion, aren't we?

15
00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.633
Didn't I tell you he mainly keeps a low profile?

16
00:00:41.966 --> 00:00:44.100
Hello, I'm an intern.

17
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.600
Right? The CEO was late on his first day on the job

18
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.400
I think you don't want to mix it up

19
00:00:49.933 --> 00:00:51.233
I'm the CEO.

20
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.433
You and I are also the wife of the president

21
00:00:55.533 --> 00:00:58.100
Just your satchel with free shipping of 9 yuan 9.

22
00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.233
It's not even a fraction of my bag

23
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.900
You think CEOs are all new machine wholesalers

24
00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:03.766
Yes

25
00:01:05.933 --> 00:01:07.600
The CEO didn't come

26
00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.666
I am the head of the department

27
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.466
Is the quality of the employees recruited by the company so low now?

28
00:01:13.466 --> 00:01:15.666
The CEO is addicted to acting, right?

29
00:01:15.666 --> 00:01:18.100
Why don't you become an actor?

30
00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:21.133
Hey, actors need a major

31
00:01:21.133 --> 00:01:22.333
However, there is an actor

32
00:01:22.333 --> 00:01:24.000
You don't need a degree

33
00:01:24.133 --> 00:01:25.633
He's a good fit

34
00:01:25.666 --> 00:01:28.066
However, it is not suitable for children to fight yesterday

35
00:01:28.066 --> 00:01:30.433
Then I'm really going to contribute to the box office

36
00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.000
Hahahaha

37
00:01:33.466 --> 00:01:35.033
Hahahaha

38
00:01:43.066 --> 00:01:44.933
You must be the new CEO

39
00:01:44.933 --> 00:01:46.500
The office is ready for you.

40
00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:47.500
Come inside please

41
00:01:49.566 --> 00:01:50.566
wrong person

42
00:01:50.566 --> 00:01:53.266
Also, Brother Yue is now in the hospital.

43
00:01:53.266 --> 00:01:55.700
I must find someone to temporarily represent the group

44
00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.533
If I were to become CEO

45
00:01:57.533 --> 00:02:00.600
Isn't it a matter of minutes to be his wife?

46
00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.766
Yes, I'm the CEO.
