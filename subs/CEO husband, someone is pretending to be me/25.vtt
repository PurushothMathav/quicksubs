00:00:03.966 --> 00:00:04.766
What!

2
00:00:05.266 --> 00:00:06.700
It was compromised.

3
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:08.600
I'll be right there.

4
00:00:12.766 --> 00:00:14.633
Xiaoye hands over the company to you

5
00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:16.666
And that's how I run it.

6
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.566
The Longcheng project is a year's hard work of the group.

7
00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.566
Since you leaked it like this

8
00:00:22.566 --> 00:00:24.533
Are you going to make the entire group's efforts

9
00:00:24.533 --> 00:00:25.833
All for nothing?

10
00:00:25.866 --> 00:00:27.400
The project is me locked in a drawer

11
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:28.700
Impossible to leak?

12
00:00:29.366 --> 00:00:31.000
What else do you have to quibble about?

13
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.100
This is not something 10 billion can solve

14
00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:34.366
Last night?

15
00:00:34.366 --> 00:00:35.566
The Wang family saw you

16
00:00:35.566 --> 00:00:37.500
The last person to leave the company

17
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.100
If you hadn't leaked

18
00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:40.600
Who else could it be?

19
00:00:40.666 --> 00:00:43.066
I see, since it was you who leaked the secret

20
00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.600
Then you 10 billion pay for it

21
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.600
Really? Last night?

22
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.166
I did see Song Nianyi

23
00:00:49.166 --> 00:00:50.600
Last to leave the office

24
00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.266
He was smiling so happily when he was about to die

25
00:00:54.266 --> 00:00:57.500
I really don't take the old lady and Long Shao seriously

26
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.566
Screenshot book is right

27
00:01:02.566 --> 00:01:03.633
You're fired.

28
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.600
Leaking confidential company documents

29
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.200
The company reserves the right to sue

30
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.300
Enough, Song Nianyi

31
00:01:09.733 --> 00:01:11.800
At this point, you're still arguing.

32
00:01:12.133 --> 00:01:14.700
How do you deserve to be the CEO of a company?

33
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:15.533
old lady

34
00:01:15.533 --> 00:01:17.766
I respect you before I call you old lady

35
00:01:17.766 --> 00:01:19.266
But you must have forgotten

36
00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:21.400
You have been out of this group for many years

37
00:01:21.533 --> 00:01:24.800
Now I'm the head of this group
