00:00:00.766 --> 00:00:02.533
Ah, ma'am, the people below are not sensible

2
00:00:02.533 --> 00:00:03.666
Withhold your black card.

3
00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:05.500
Please don't live as well as villains.

4
00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:05.966
original

5
00:00:05.966 --> 00:00:08.666
They have never met the real president's wife either

6
00:00:08.933 --> 00:00:09.933
That black card is obviously me

7
00:00:09.933 --> 00:00:12.800
I'm not surprised you haven't seen me.

8
00:00:13.266 --> 00:00:14.266
After all

9
00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:17.033
After getting pregnant with Brother Ye's child

10
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:19.100
He keeps an eye on me.

11
00:00:19.166 --> 00:00:20.600
Don't let me go out

12
00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:27.866
The president will be here soon.

13
00:00:27.866 --> 00:00:28.900
Go faster.

14
00:00:29.566 --> 00:00:31.166
It drifts any faster

15
00:00:31.166 --> 00:00:32.466
You have to count down.

16
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.566
The president's wife has a child

17
00:00:37.666 --> 00:00:39.700
Some people are really blind

18
00:00:39.933 --> 00:00:41.766
How dare you destroy someone else's marriage?

19
00:00:43.733 --> 00:00:45.333
You said the black card is yours.

20
00:00:45.333 --> 00:00:46.633
What evidence do you have?

21
00:00:48.766 --> 00:00:52.233
Can the waiter who swiped the card prove the person?

22
00:00:56.133 --> 00:00:58.133
Miss, I'm not sure if this card is genuine

23
00:00:58.133 --> 00:00:59.366
Wait a minute, I'll check it out.

24
00:00:59.366 --> 00:01:02.300
I already said you can't offend me

25
00:01:13.466 --> 00:01:14.266
president

26
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.866
This bitch has repeatedly defied my authority

27
00:01:17.866 --> 00:01:19.800
Dare to impersonate the president's wife

28
00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:20.966
What are you still doing?

29
00:01:20.966 --> 00:01:22.500
Drag him out now

30
00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.466
You jump to a conclusion after wading through the water argument

31
00:01:33.533 --> 00:01:35.200
Is that how you do things?

32
00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.633
How dare you question me?

33
00:01:36.733 --> 00:01:38.266
Don't look at the president's wife

34
00:01:38.266 --> 00:01:39.800
What can you afford?

35
00:01:39.966 --> 00:01:42.000
Get out of here, you beggar

36
00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:52.700
President Nangong arrives

37
00:02:01.466 --> 00:02:02.400
Yeah brother

38
00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.200
Hey, president, you're here

39
00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.466
This woman dares to impersonate your wife

40
00:02:10.466 --> 00:02:11.833
I was just about to wake you up

41
00:02:12.933 --> 00:02:14.400
My wife only has one.

42
00:02:14.933 --> 00:02:16.033
That is.
