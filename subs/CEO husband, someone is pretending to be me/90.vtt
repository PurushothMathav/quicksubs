Nini

2
00:00:03.133 --> 00:00:05.366
Brother, why are you here?

3
00:00:08.166 --> 00:00:09.666
I rarely go back to China

4
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.966
Can't you come and see my dear sister?

5
00:00:12.733 --> 00:00:13.700
Congratulations!

6
00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:15.166
Became the head of the Qiao family

7
00:00:15.166 --> 00:00:16.700
Even you make fun of me

8
00:00:17.366 --> 00:00:19.700
Okay. You can come any time. I welcome you any time.

9
00:00:21.366 --> 00:00:22.166
Hey

10
00:00:23.766 --> 00:00:25.800
Miss the flowers you like

11
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.733
From now on, our yard will be planted with flowers

12
00:00:27.733 --> 00:00:30.300
This flower looks a little withered

13
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.633
Throw it away, what are you doing?

14
00:00:33.133 --> 00:00:34.866
I just picked it from the yard

15
00:00:34.866 --> 00:00:36.500
Nian Nian clearly likes it very much

16
00:00:37.333 --> 00:00:41.166
Oh, Master Qiao, can't you even afford flowers?

17
00:00:41.466 --> 00:00:44.166
Oh, you two, stop arguing.

18
00:00:44.166 --> 00:00:46.700
Why is it that every time we meet, you just leave it alone?

19
00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:51.833
Ok two childish

20
00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.300
Then you taste it slowly

21
00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:58.000
OK

22
00:00:59.266 --> 00:01:00.600
Oh, right.

23
00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.900
I remember that Master Qiao said he wanted to have a blind date with you

24
00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:05.200
Didn't you just come back?

25
00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:06.600
Call your grandfather

26
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.766
Nangong Ye, you are despicable

27
00:01:09.366 --> 00:01:11.066
After all, you are also my brother-in-law

28
00:01:11.066 --> 00:01:12.100
I am your brother

29
00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:14.533
Hey, is it Grandpa Qiao?

30
00:01:14.533 --> 00:01:15.733
Yancheng is back

31
00:01:15.733 --> 00:01:16.766
He changed his mind.

32
00:01:16.766 --> 00:01:17.900
Looking for a home

33
00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:19.700
He wants to find a home

34
00:01:27.733 --> 00:01:29.666
My wife likes flowers so much

35
00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:33.500
Did you hear?

36
00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.166
Chairperson of Nangong Ye Birthday Group

37
00:01:35.166 --> 00:01:36.733
The beloved group president

38
00:01:36.733 --> 00:01:38.066
It's Mrs. Nangong

39
00:01:38.466 --> 00:01:40.766
I heard that he is not only Mrs. Nangong

40
00:01:40.766 --> 00:01:42.166
The richest man in the country.

41
00:01:42.166 --> 00:01:43.266
Joe's daughter

42
00:01:43.266 --> 00:01:44.666
The current head of the Qiao family

43
00:01:44.666 --> 00:01:45.800
So awesome

44
00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.666
It was Nangong Group that was in crisis

45
00:01:48.666 --> 00:01:50.366
When Nangong Ye had a car accident

46
00:01:50.366 --> 00:01:52.200
It was this lady who turned the tide

47
00:01:53.866 --> 00:01:54.866
The most amazing
