00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:01.966
What nonsense are you talking about?

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.166
This longevity lock was originally mine

3
00:00:04.166 --> 00:00:05.466
You pretend to be the president's wife

4
00:00:05.466 --> 00:00:07.166
Forget about the down payment.

5
00:00:07.166 --> 00:00:09.800
Why do you even want to take away my longevity lock?

6
00:00:10.133 --> 00:00:12.266
It turned out that he was at the dinner party of Nangong Group

7
00:00:12.266 --> 00:00:14.233
A third party posing as the president's wife

8
00:00:14.366 --> 00:00:15.900
It's so unbelievable

9
00:00:16.266 --> 00:00:20.000
I really didn't expect to see such a thing shamelessly

10
00:00:21.733 --> 00:00:24.033
This longevity lock was handed down to me by my mother

11
00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:25.400
Been with me for more than 20 years

12
00:00:25.566 --> 00:00:26.966
How did it become yours?

13
00:00:27.466 --> 00:00:29.700
You interfered in my relationship with Brother Ye

14
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:31.966
Brother Ye made an exception to make you the CEO

15
00:00:31.966 --> 00:00:32.800
You are not satisfied

16
00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.366
Smaller than someone else's husband

17
00:00:34.366 --> 00:00:36.033
And steal someone else's identity

18
00:00:36.066 --> 00:00:38.600
Nangong Ye also made you his CEO

19
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
It seems that Nangong Group is really in a downward trend

20
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.766
He is also the CEO of Nangong Group

21
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.033
It can't be exchanged for the body, can it?

22
00:00:48.333 --> 00:00:50.833
I can attest to this

23
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:52.633
Before in the company

24
00:00:52.666 --> 00:00:55.266
South Industries is for this woman

25
00:00:55.366 --> 00:00:56.666
Hit his wife

26
00:00:56.666 --> 00:00:57.833
What nonsense are you talking about?

27
00:00:59.566 --> 00:01:01.233
This guy has a bad record

28
00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:02.833
vulgar behavior

29
00:01:03.166 --> 00:01:04.700
He has a million plans.

30
00:01:05.066 --> 00:01:08.266
Miss An attended the return banquet later

31
00:01:09.066 --> 00:01:10.266
old man

32
00:01:10.533 --> 00:01:13.033
Please don't fall for him.

33
00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.566
What evidence do you have to prove that this place is yours?

34
00:01:18.933 --> 00:01:20.200
What's mine is mine.

35
00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:21.633
What am I proving?

36
00:01:21.733 --> 00:01:24.866
But you look like a dog

37
00:01:24.866 --> 00:01:27.666
Wouldn't it be Song Nian Yi's imprisoned soldier?

38
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.566
I'm not afraid of getting sick.

39
00:01:32.266 --> 00:01:33.633
Hmph, but I blocked it

40
00:01:34.133 --> 00:01:36.033
It would be great if my sister was like this

41
00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:39.233
Of course you have no evidence

42
00:01:39.466 --> 00:01:41.233
After being damaged by long life

43
00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:42.900
I sent him to fix it.

44
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.566
But Ober is hard to come by

45
00:01:44.566 --> 00:01:46.366
This gem is no longer available in China.

46
00:01:46.566 --> 00:01:48.633
That's why it's waiting to be repaired in the jewelry store.

47
00:01:49.466 --> 00:01:52.033
I didn't expect it to be stolen by you.

48
00:01:54.333 --> 00:01:56.866
I keep the broken Ouguo at my house.

49
00:01:57.166 --> 00:01:58.800
Do you dare to confront me?
