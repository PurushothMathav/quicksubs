1
00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.766
My grandson.

2
00:00:02.766 --> 00:00:03.900
My tummy

3
00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:05.900
My child.

4
00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:07.566
I'll get the family doctor right away

5
00:00:08.566 --> 00:00:09.800
Get lost!

6
00:00:10.766 --> 00:00:13.033
There are poisonous women like you in this world

7
00:00:13.366 --> 00:00:15.233
The next time I pay attention to a pregnant woman

8
00:00:15.533 --> 00:00:16.600
I should be grateful

9
00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.566
My son didn't marry a woman like you

10
00:00:19.166 --> 00:00:19.966
Come on.

11
00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.033
You better pray my grandson is okay

12
00:00:29.066 --> 00:00:30.300
I didn't push him.

13
00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:01.500
It's not a good thing yet

14
00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.400
Don't think too much about bad things

15
00:01:03.566 --> 00:01:05.233
You are my hired CEO

16
00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:06.866
They are not responsible for their employees

17
00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.833
You can live from Miss Song to the hospital to treat the wound.
