00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:04.900
You are the CEO

2
00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:06.433
What am I?

3
00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:13.500
It's really a big forest. There are all kinds of birds

4
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.866
The owner has come and put this outfit on

5
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.766
It's the CEO's earrings, but Cartier

6
00:00:18.766 --> 00:00:19.866
Global limited edition

7
00:00:19.866 --> 00:00:21.233
Look at yourself again

8
00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:23.700
I can smell something

9
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:27.000
Poor sour taste hahahahaha

10
00:00:27.766 --> 00:00:28.566
Ah!

11
00:00:28.566 --> 00:00:31.300
I didn't expect the company to worship the wind of high mining so seriously

12
00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:32.533
It's better to be wrong

13
00:00:32.533 --> 00:00:34.666
Let's see whose million-dollar group is rising

14
00:00:35.366 --> 00:00:36.833
Hello again.

15
00:00:39.966 --> 00:00:43.600
This time I'll make your life worse than death

16
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.100
We'll see won't we.

17
00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.566
Welcome sir

18
00:01:11.366 --> 00:01:13.833
George, find me someone.

19
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.133
It's called Song Nianyi Dad

20
00:01:17.133 --> 00:01:18.800
Nian Nian has been missing for more than 20 years

21
00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.466
Maybe it's gone, Dad, give up

22
00:01:21.933 --> 00:01:23.100
What do you know?

23
00:01:23.666 --> 00:01:24.700
No granddaughter

24
00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.066
What's the use of me being the richest man in the country?

25
00:01:27.066 --> 00:01:30.366
Hey dad, you have to think about your body too

26
00:01:30.366 --> 00:01:31.666
For the last time.

27
00:01:31.666 --> 00:01:32.933
If you still can't find it

28
00:01:32.933 --> 00:01:35.166
You have to go to the hospital for emergency treatment.

29
00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.766
Is it really you every year?
