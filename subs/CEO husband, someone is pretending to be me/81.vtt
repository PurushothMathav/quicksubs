00:00:06.666 --> 00:00:08.500
Didn't you say you would let Yingying go?

2
00:00:08.533 --> 00:00:11.066
Ah, how could he enter the hospital to talk?

3
00:00:11.066 --> 00:00:12.366
How did he end up in the hospital?

4
00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:15.066
It was An Yingying who fell by herself

5
00:00:15.066 --> 00:00:16.400
It has nothing to do with Nian Nian

6
00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:17.900
I don't want to hear your nonsense

7
00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:20.833
If something goes wrong with Yingying

8
00:00:21.666 --> 00:00:23.500
I will definitely make you pay

9
00:00:25.133 --> 00:00:26.000
price

10
00:00:26.533 --> 00:00:29.400
Wonsheng, we sent An Yan to the hospital again

11
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:30.800
Already benevolent

12
00:00:31.266 --> 00:00:32.900
Just the things you do

13
00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.066
It's cheap for you to eat for a lifetime

14
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:38.366
Here we go.

15
00:00:43.133 --> 00:00:46.400
By the way, the reason why I sent An Yingying to the hospital

16
00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.000
Find him the best doctor

17
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.266
Just because the child is innocent

18
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.166
Who are the patient's family members?

19
00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.066
I am a doctor

20
00:01:03.366 --> 00:01:04.333
How is the patient now?

21
00:01:04.333 --> 00:01:04.900
Keep the adults

22
00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:05.933
The baby is gone

23
00:01:05.933 --> 00:01:07.533
The patient is currently emotionally unstable

24
00:01:07.533 --> 00:01:10.033
You, as a husband, try your best to comfort and comfort

25
00:01:26.666 --> 00:01:28.166
Oops don't move

26
00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:29.833
Just tell me what you need.

27
00:01:30.166 --> 00:01:32.300
What about my child?

28
00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:34.033
Child back to me

29
00:01:34.333 --> 00:01:36.633
We'll have another one when you're better.

30
00:01:36.666 --> 00:01:38.366
Who wants to have a baby with you?

31
00:01:39.266 --> 00:01:40.733
The child belongs to Brother Ye

32
00:01:40.733 --> 00:01:43.766
No, I'm going to find the child. Oops.

33
00:01:46.066 --> 00:01:47.566
I will always be with you.

34
00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:49.266
I won't leave you.

35
00:01:50.266 --> 00:01:52.900
Brother Ye is with me because of the child

36
00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.233
What should I do without children?

37
00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.400
Let go of you, it's not Brother Ye

38
00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.600
Brother Ye is the president of Nangong Group

39
00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.400
I am the wife of the president

40
00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:04.466
I'm going to find my child.

41
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:06.800
Yuan Longyi

42
00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:08.633
Song Jianyi

43
00:02:09.333 --> 00:02:11.066
I won't let you go
