00:00:19.366 --> 00:00:21.000
As expected of the richest daughter

2
00:00:21.133 --> 00:00:22.533
Extraordinary temperament

3
00:00:22.533 --> 00:00:24.366
Hey, twist the egg, twist the egg

4
00:00:24.566 --> 00:00:25.700
Haha, I heard it long ago

5
00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:27.933
Director Qiao's father once made one with his own hands

6
00:00:27.933 --> 00:00:28.900
Hundreds of millions of long-life locks

7
00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:30.266
As a token of recognition

8
00:00:30.466 --> 00:00:33.366
I don't know if I have the honor to see a thing or two

9
00:00:34.166 --> 00:00:36.066
Nian Nian, this is Uncle Chen

10
00:00:36.066 --> 00:00:39.300
Well, he wants to see the longevity lock

11
00:00:40.066 --> 00:00:42.233
Uncle Chen, I'm so sorry.

12
00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.100
The long-life lock was accidentally damaged before.

13
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.466
I sent him in for repair

14
00:00:45.466 --> 00:00:47.500
Nothing in life is dead or bad

15
00:00:47.666 --> 00:00:49.766
It's gone, I just don't want me to see it

16
00:00:50.066 --> 00:00:53.333
The orphanage has no breath at all.

17
00:00:53.333 --> 00:00:54.300
It's okay. It's okay.

18
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.766
I offended this is a personal item

19
00:00:56.766 --> 00:00:58.200
Jojo doesn't want to show it to us

20
00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:59.800
It's understandable.

21
00:01:00.333 --> 00:01:01.400
I'm not.

22
00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:05.466
Of course he can't take it out

23
00:01:05.766 --> 00:01:08.433
Who is this? Who is this?

24
00:01:08.666 --> 00:01:09.466
This

25
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.233
Didn't you see it?

26
00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:16.866
What kind of relationship is this?

27
00:01:17.533 --> 00:01:18.566
longevity

28
00:01:19.066 --> 00:01:21.466
Because he's not a down payment daughter at all

29
00:01:21.466 --> 00:01:22.766
Can't take out the long life
