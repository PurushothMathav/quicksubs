1
00:00:00.466 --> 00:00:01.933
He is not satisfied with his daughter

2
00:00:01.933 --> 00:00:03.433
Found a poor boy

3
00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:05.600
So I said hi to everyone

4
00:00:05.933 --> 00:00:07.566
Blocked Zhou Huaijin from starting a business

5
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:09.633
That's not possible.

6
00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:11.700
You are lying to me.

7
00:00:11.733 --> 00:00:13.266
I lied to you.

8
00:00:13.866 --> 00:00:15.600
It's because he doesn't want to embarrass you

9
00:00:15.866 --> 00:00:17.733
And secretly delivering takeout outside behind your back

10
00:00:17.733 --> 00:00:18.900
Subsidized household

11
00:00:20.066 --> 00:00:21.600
I first met him

12
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.100
It's because he helped me retrieve my robbed bag.

13
00:00:26.533 --> 00:00:27.900
Are you all right?

14
00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:30.966
It's okay, thank you.

15
00:00:31.866 --> 00:00:33.900
Otherwise, you should go to the hospital to have a look.

16
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:35.766
You were hurt for me too

17
00:00:35.766 --> 00:00:37.966
It's too exaggerated to go to the hospital for this injury

18
00:00:37.966 --> 00:00:39.900
And my wife looked worried.

19
00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:41.466
Back?

20
00:00:42.333 --> 00:00:43.233
It's okay. It's okay.

21
00:00:45.866 --> 00:00:48.300
I was the one who peeked at his plan

22
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.433
I got my dad to support him

23
00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.200
Your dad held him down 7 years ago

24
00:00:54.566 --> 00:00:58.366
7 years later you still want him to have nothing

25
00:01:05.266 --> 00:01:06.233
Only Me

26
00:01:06.933 --> 00:01:08.866
The one who deserves to stand by his side

27
00:01:10.166 --> 00:01:10.966
Jiangwan

28
00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.200
If you really love him

29
00:01:13.666 --> 00:01:15.300
Don't be so selfish

30
00:01:22.966 --> 00:01:24.433
If you really love him

31
00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.400
Don't be so selfish

32
00:01:27.666 --> 00:01:29.366
Decided not to give up on you

33
00:01:29.366 --> 00:01:31.066
The phone you dialed is turned off, please

34
00:01:32.566 --> 00:01:33.366
pick up

35
00:01:35.066 --> 00:01:38.000
Hello, the phone you dialed is turned off.

36
00:01:40.766 --> 00:01:42.100
Hey boss

37
00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:44.400
Why don't you answer the phone?

38
00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:45.766
I'm worried to death.

39
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.866
I'm fine, I'll go upstairs and change my clothes first

40
00:01:50.266 --> 00:01:52.666
I'll finish the set for you, I swear

41
00:02:02.733 --> 00:02:03.566
Sorry.

42
00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.633
All about you

43
00:02:16.966 --> 00:02:17.766
boss

44
00:02:26.566 --> 00:02:27.366
