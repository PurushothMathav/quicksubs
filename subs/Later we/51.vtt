1
00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:02.066
You are his biological father

2
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:08.500
Smoke me

3
00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:14.500
young master

4
00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:16.800
I am the biological father of my little brother

5
00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:17.966
He's six years old.

6
00:00:17.966 --> 00:00:19.666
How could I possibly be his biological father?

7
00:00:19.866 --> 00:00:21.900
What the hell is going on? Please explain it to me.

8
00:00:22.133 --> 00:00:23.800
I made him say that on purpose

9
00:00:24.366 --> 00:00:26.266
I just don't want you to know the truth

10
00:00:26.766 --> 00:00:28.633
Why don't you let me know the truth?

11
00:00:29.066 --> 00:00:30.166
Why would you do that?

12
00:00:30.166 --> 00:00:30.933
Why exactly?

13
00:00:30.933 --> 00:00:33.366
Why do I want so much when you come back?

14
00:00:48.766 --> 00:00:51.033
Damn you waiting for so many guests

15
00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:52.566
Leave my aunt behind

16
00:00:52.566 --> 00:00:54.700
Have you considered our feelings?

17
00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.900
Sorry.

18
00:00:56.466 --> 00:00:58.966
I will explain this clearly to the public.

19
00:00:59.966 --> 00:01:00.966
It's just me

20
00:01:00.966 --> 00:01:02.833
Qin Yuxi and I are his father

21
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.366
You go up first

22
00:01:05.666 --> 00:01:07.233
I want to talk to Huai Jing alone

23
00:01:07.533 --> 00:01:12.166
I'll take care of you when you're done, brat

24
00:01:18.566 --> 00:01:19.366
Huaijing

25
00:01:20.166 --> 00:01:22.366
Do you care so much about Jiang Wanyi?

26
00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:23.666
You know it all

27
00:01:23.666 --> 00:01:26.166
I just feel ridiculous because sooner or later

28
00:01:26.366 --> 00:01:27.833
He treats you like that

29
00:01:28.333 --> 00:01:30.300
You still want to be with him

30
00:01:31.966 --> 00:01:32.766
Bad sister

31
00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.100
I was first engaged to you

32
00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.800
It's not all about my dad

33
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.700
Don't you understand, Jinyue?

34
00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.133
The reason why I help you

35
00:01:42.133 --> 00:01:44.266
For the sake of our relationship

36
00:01:44.266 --> 00:01:47.633
I have always had only one person in my heart

37
00:01:48.133 --> 00:01:48.966
nostalgia

38
00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.633
Can't you look at me?

39
00:01:51.933 --> 00:01:52.766
We

40
00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:54.966
We're the ones who should be together

41
00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.100
Is that so?

42
00:01:56.266 --> 00:01:58.466
I can pretend today didn't happen.

43
00:01:58.533 --> 00:01:59.900
I'll explain it to everyone

44
00:02:00.133 --> 00:02:01.600
Is our wedding going to continue?

45
00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:02.866
Marriage

46
00:02:03.366 --> 00:02:04.233
Except for home

47
00:02:05.333 --> 00:02:06.300
It's all family

48
00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:08.200
All generals

49
00:02:10.333 --> 00:02:11.166
OK

50
00:02:13.533 --> 00:02:14.700
Oh, I see.

51
00:02:16.366 --> 00:02:17.600
You go first

52
00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.366
I'll explain it to my dad sorry

53
00:02:29.066 --> 00:02:30.200
in case

54
00:02:30.566 --> 00:02:32.666
You don't deserve to go back to Huaijing Shenzhen at all
