00:00:06.533 --> 00:00:08.666
What did the doctor say?

2
00:00:10.466 --> 00:00:12.300
The doctor said that he will be drunk by the end of this month

3
00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:14.100
It's going to be a book.

4
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.000
Don't worry, there's still me

5
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.200
How much is the difference in surgery costs?

6
00:00:19.666 --> 00:00:22.833
No, my mom left me with some obligations

7
00:00:23.133 --> 00:00:24.700
It should sell for some money.

8
00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:26.900
That's the last thing your mother left you

9
00:00:26.933 --> 00:00:28.066
How can you sell it?

10
00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:29.466
It matters to the younger brother

11
00:00:34.733 --> 00:00:35.400
This rainforest?

12
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:36.333
So easy to deceive

13
00:00:36.333 --> 00:00:37.700
Probably in a hurry to use the money

14
00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:39.733
I added something to his cup

15
00:00:39.733 --> 00:00:41.600
Wait a minute, I'll send someone to you.

16
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:42.733
OK, OK, OK. He's coming.

17
00:00:42.733 --> 00:00:43.900
I won't talk to you for now

18
00:00:47.266 --> 00:00:48.133
I'm sorry, Mr. Xu

19
00:00:48.133 --> 00:00:50.700
I'm late, it doesn't matter, you're in a hurry too

20
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:51.900
Take a sip of water first

21
00:00:58.533 --> 00:01:00.766
Mr. Xu, this is the necklace I want to sell.

22
00:01:00.766 --> 00:01:01.766
Please take a look.

23
00:01:01.866 --> 00:01:03.066
Things are nice

24
00:01:03.066 --> 00:01:05.333
But for the price, I can only give you 500,000

25
00:01:05.333 --> 00:01:07.033
500,000 so low

26
00:01:07.666 --> 00:01:09.000
Mr. Xu, take a look again.

27
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.566
This necklace is for the master

28
00:01:10.566 --> 00:01:12.366
Natural diamonds are hand-beaten

29
00:01:12.366 --> 00:01:13.866
Could you add some more?

30
00:01:14.333 --> 00:01:15.566
Fine. Then 600,000

31
00:01:15.566 --> 00:01:16.733
You can only give so much.

32
00:01:16.733 --> 00:01:18.566
Let's go over there to get the money

33
00:01:20.066 --> 00:01:21.566
Where are you taking him?
