1
00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:02.600
I have nothing to say to you

2
00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:04.600
You have nothing to say to me

3
00:00:04.733 --> 00:00:06.700
Then you use gentle compassion

4
00:00:06.733 --> 00:00:07.800
Make him reluctant to divorce you

5
00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.466
How do you say this?

6
00:00:09.566 --> 00:00:11.566
That's between me and the doll too

7
00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:13.266
When he was in trouble

8
00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:14.600
I was with him.

9
00:00:14.933 --> 00:00:16.500
It's all settled now.

10
00:00:16.966 --> 00:00:18.433
You want to take him back?

11
00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:21.433
Why didn't I know about this?

12
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.800
But seeing how much you have sacrificed for him

13
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.566
I can give Shaw a few big projects

14
00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.300
Enough to bring Shaw back to life

15
00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.033
But I only have one request.

16
00:00:31.766 --> 00:00:33.266
Immediate and Perfect Divorce

17
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.400
Impossible Xiao's is not as big as it used to be

18
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.266
Di's condition is also very complicated.

19
00:00:40.366 --> 00:00:42.100
There are many places to spend money

20
00:00:42.466 --> 00:00:44.000
Are you sure you helped?

21
00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.700
Letting go is the best thing you can do

22
00:00:54.333 --> 00:00:58.566
What's more, you and Wan Wan will divorce sooner or later

23
00:01:16.533 --> 00:01:17.433
Mr. Xiao

24
00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:19.800
So distressed?

25
00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.833
Maybe I can help you.
