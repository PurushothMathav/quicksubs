Mr. Su

2
00:00:01.866 --> 00:00:03.266
You want to buy my necklace.

3
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:04.966
Yeah, I'm going to buy it.

4
00:00:04.966 --> 00:00:07.000
Wear it on my engagement party with Huai Jin

5
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.600
I should have known the necklace was yours

6
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:10.300
I don't have to ask for such a big circle.

7
00:00:10.333 --> 00:00:11.666
500,000, right?

8
00:00:16.066 --> 00:00:16.866
can

9
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:19.933
Excuse me?

10
00:00:19.933 --> 00:00:21.700
I don't sell it, I don't sell it.

11
00:00:21.933 --> 00:00:24.700
Why is this necklace style too old?

12
00:00:24.766 --> 00:00:27.000
It is not suitable for you to wear it on such an important occasion.

13
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:27.900
Yeah.

14
00:00:28.533 --> 00:00:29.866
That's who I am

15
00:00:29.866 --> 00:00:32.866
As long as it's something I like, I won't let go

16
00:00:33.933 --> 00:00:35.300
I know you can't bear it

17
00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:36.900
I gave you an extra 100,000

18
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:38.633
Thank you for giving up

19
00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:40.566
I have something else to do

20
00:00:40.966 --> 00:00:41.966
Just go first

21
00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.000
Jiao Wanyi, whether it is a person or a necklace

22
00:00:48.166 --> 00:00:49.600
You can't keep any of them.

23
00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.833
Uncle Zhou Xiaodi

24
00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:00.900
I've been waiting for you for a long time.

25
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:01.933
What are you waiting for me for?

26
00:01:01.933 --> 00:01:03.300
Because I like you

27
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.066
I want to see you more

28
00:01:08.366 --> 00:01:11.466
Thank you. He is the child of Jiang Wanyi and Xiao Yi.

29
00:01:11.866 --> 00:01:13.633
I'm leaving the hospital tomorrow

30
00:01:13.733 --> 00:01:15.166
You don't have to wait for me anymore.

31
00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:16.466
Go find your mother

32
00:01:20.533 --> 00:01:22.966
Uncle Rou

33
00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.033
Don't go!
