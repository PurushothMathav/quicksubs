1
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.666
Then you say it's 7 years later

2
00:00:09.266 --> 00:00:11.800
Do you have any evidence to prove it?

3
00:00:13.533 --> 00:00:15.566
How do you want us to prove it?

4
00:00:18.166 --> 00:00:21.500
You said you knew me and Wan Wan in college

5
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.000
Then I ask you

6
00:00:24.866 --> 00:00:28.600
When did Wan Wan and I start dating?

7
00:00:29.366 --> 00:00:30.500
big year

8
00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.933
After you finish your speech as an outstanding student representative

9
00:00:32.933 --> 00:00:34.466
Wanwan will apologize to you before

10
00:00:38.333 --> 00:00:39.133
that

11
00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.166
When are we getting married?

12
00:00:41.166 --> 00:00:42.100
August 23rd.

13
00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.466
Where was the wedding held in Jiang Da's father's small auditorium?

14
00:00:44.533 --> 00:00:45.900
Parents are often absent.

15
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:47.566
They are all college classmates.

16
00:00:50.533 --> 00:00:51.966
Over the years

17
00:00:52.266 --> 00:00:55.066
He actually remembers these details so clearly

18
00:00:57.366 --> 00:00:59.000
It's really true

19
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.400
What if you still don't believe it?

20
00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:04.666
Just open it yourself

21
00:01:04.666 --> 00:01:05.266
These?

22
00:01:05.266 --> 00:01:07.800
It's all the gifts you've prepared for 7 years.

23
00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.266
You once promised Wanwan

24
00:01:20.666 --> 00:01:22.700
Do you want to change him for a bigger diamond ring?

25
00:01:29.533 --> 00:01:31.433
I often want to open a studio

26
00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:32.633
So

27
00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.300
You bought his favorite studio

28
00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.500
Also, since going abroad at night

29
00:01:41.266 --> 00:01:43.766
You fly to his city on business every year

30
00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.233
These tickets are proof

31
00:01:47.666 --> 00:01:50.966
Now you always believe it's 7 years later, right?

32
00:01:52.866 --> 00:01:55.100
And where was he that night?

33
00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.233
him
