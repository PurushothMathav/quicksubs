00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.666
Yo Jiang is satisfied

2
00:00:02.733 --> 00:00:06.066
Ouch, hey two, look who this is

3
00:00:06.066 --> 00:00:07.966
This is not the man of the hour at our school

4
00:00:07.966 --> 00:00:09.300
Miss daughter?

5
00:00:09.566 --> 00:00:10.933
Why is this shape today?

6
00:00:10.933 --> 00:00:15.233
I can't die, I can't die, hahaha

7
00:00:16.566 --> 00:00:17.466
Where are you?

8
00:00:17.533 --> 00:00:18.700
I'll go first

9
00:00:21.366 --> 00:00:23.066
Hey don't go

10
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.700
Drink, keep drinking

11
00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:29.033
Didn't you just talk so much because your mouth was salty?

12
00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.100
Zhou Huanxi, let me go

13
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:33.700
What should I do if you mess with him?

14
00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.400
This is what you said, no problem with Xiao Yi

15
00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.000
Come to the night show as a waiter

16
00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.633
I'm just here for a part-time job.

17
00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:43.200
You think too much

18
00:00:44.066 --> 00:00:44.866
Zhao Yi

19
00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.900
If you can't let me go

20
00:00:58.766 --> 00:01:00.233
I can't let you go

21
00:01:01.133 --> 00:01:02.300
Forced marriage

22
00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:06.233
So in case you still think you're right

23
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.600
Your drinks are in a hurry

24
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.866
Ask my boyfriend to pour me a drink

25
00:01:27.333 --> 00:01:28.166
Turn around.

26
00:01:36.766 --> 00:01:38.933
Can't finish a glass of wine

27
00:01:38.933 --> 00:01:40.666
And got my shoes dirty

28
00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:42.800
Kneel down and wipe me clean

29
00:01:43.333 --> 00:01:45.266
Sister Zhou Hui, is enough for you?

30
00:01:45.266 --> 00:01:47.866
Isn't that what he does as a waiter?

31
00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:49.166
You still think

32
00:01:49.166 --> 00:01:51.833
Is that still the eldest lady of the Jiang family back then?

33
00:02:10.466 --> 00:02:11.700
What about identity?

34
00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.566
Just in time, husband, you go in first.

35
00:02:14.866 --> 00:02:16.366
Wait for my Moments

36
00:02:16.733 --> 00:02:17.700
Give me a room

37
00:02:17.966 --> 00:02:20.000
How nice this house is! I love this house

38
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.800
This house doesn't work

39
00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:21.766
Not worthy of your fare

40
00:02:22.466 --> 00:02:25.100
Husband, you are so kind to me.

41
00:02:26.133 --> 00:02:26.933
Go ahead.
