00:00:00.666 --> 00:00:02.366
Are you cold?

2
00:00:02.366 --> 00:00:03.900
How to wear a turtleneck sweater

3
00:00:10.133 --> 00:00:12.900
Ah, I grew up cold.

4
00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:13.900
So I'm afraid of the cold

5
00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:15.100
It's a little thicker

6
00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:22.500
Don't be busy everyone

7
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.233
Mr. Zhou invites everyone to drink

8
00:00:25.266 --> 00:00:27.166
Thank you Mr. Zhou

9
00:00:27.366 --> 00:00:28.266
Thank you Mr. Zhou

10
00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:56.166
Then you go to work

11
00:01:09.733 --> 00:01:11.800
In case the plan I asked you to prepare last time

12
00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.000
How are you preparing?

13
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.200
It's ready.

14
00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.933
We have made a total of four versions of the plan this time.

15
00:01:15.933 --> 00:01:17.866
The client finally opted for the third edition

16
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.366
They had an interview this afternoon

17
00:01:23.366 --> 00:01:24.533
You go there first

18
00:01:24.533 --> 00:01:26.900
I have a meeting this afternoon. Okay

19
00:01:29.666 --> 00:01:32.300
Hello, I'm from Providence Games.

20
00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:33.300
May I ask Huiying?

21
00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:35.733
Does the company's grandson always book a private room here?

22
00:01:35.733 --> 00:01:36.766
Wait a minute.

23
00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.000
Ah, yes!

24
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.366
The elevator goes to the third floor here.

25
00:01:40.366 --> 00:01:43.366
The second bag wall on the right is good, thank you.

26
00:01:56.766 --> 00:01:58.233
Why is there no one?

27
00:01:58.933 --> 00:02:00.633
Give Mr. Sun a call
