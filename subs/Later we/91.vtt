00:00:00.733 --> 00:00:02.266
You really can't run away

2
00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:05.066
You go out first

3
00:00:11.933 --> 00:00:13.100
My dad considers you a friend

4
00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:15.300
Why would you do that to your friend?

5
00:00:15.566 --> 00:00:18.266
Haha friend, how much is it worth?

6
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.466
If something goes wrong, someone should be held responsible

7
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Get home in my way

8
00:00:24.566 --> 00:00:26.000
Just be damned.

9
00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:28.100
Now think about it.

10
00:00:28.366 --> 00:00:30.933
The kind eyebrows you pretended in front of Huaijin and Su Qiyu

11
00:00:30.933 --> 00:00:32.966
You must be tired after all these years

12
00:00:32.966 --> 00:00:34.766
Huaijin regards you as a teacher

13
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.700
You didn't even let him go?

14
00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.466
Businesspeople put profit first

15
00:00:39.466 --> 00:00:41.900
He shouldn't have interfered

16
00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.366
He shouldn't have interfered

17
00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.033
Or Su Qiyu shouldn't have blocked that knife

18
00:00:46.333 --> 00:00:47.133
Su Guoqing

19
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.966
Su Qiyu is still being rescued

20
00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.900
Do you really have no regrets at all?

21
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.800
Regret for my life

22
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.433
The most regrettable thing is to help Xiaoyu support Zhou Huaijin

23
00:01:00.933 --> 00:01:04.833
If you say more, it should be over hahahaha.

24
00:01:05.266 --> 00:01:07.000
It's time to end

25
00:01:07.666 --> 00:01:10.633
But it won't end in the hands of others, Su Boqing

26
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.200
How is my dad?

27
00:01:17.866 --> 00:01:19.300
He committed suicide.

28
00:01:20.733 --> 00:01:21.700
Suicide

29
00:01:25.666 --> 00:01:27.633
I should have known

30
00:01:29.533 --> 00:01:32.033
Zhou Huaiqing, go out first

31
00:01:32.133 --> 00:01:34.066
I want to talk to Jiang Wan Yi alone

32
00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.200
If I had to choose again

33
00:01:41.966 --> 00:01:43.900
I will definitely stay at home today

34
00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:44.900
I see.

35
00:01:45.533 --> 00:01:47.100
That's your dad after all

36
00:01:48.466 --> 00:01:49.300
Jiang trillion

37
00:01:50.066 --> 00:01:53.833
Remember that I have never lost to you

38
00:01:54.866 --> 00:01:56.566
I just lost to Zhou Huaiji

39
00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:58.600
You go and tell him.

40
00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.433
I never want to see you again.

41
00:02:28.566 --> 00:02:30.566
Come on. Let's go home
