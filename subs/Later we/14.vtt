00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:01.066
Sister Huai

2
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.200
You are

3
00:00:05.566 --> 00:00:06.800
What's up?

4
00:00:07.933 --> 00:00:09.833
Uncle is fine

5
00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.100
He will be your subordinate from now on

6
00:00:16.766 --> 00:00:19.433
Please, Miss Jiang.

7
00:00:34.566 --> 00:00:36.633
Part-time job at 7pm tonight

8
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.200
Mr. Su, just call me the rest privately.

9
00:00:41.366 --> 00:00:42.300
Ah, that's right.

10
00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.200
You are a college classmate of Huai Jing

11
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.500
Then do you know about his ex-wife?

12
00:00:49.266 --> 00:00:51.500
I'm actually not very familiar with Mr. Zhou

13
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.933
So I don't know about these things.

14
00:00:53.933 --> 00:00:56.600
After all, people like him

15
00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.166
How can I stand by Huaijing?

16
00:00:58.166 --> 00:00:59.266
Huai Jing hated him

17
00:00:59.266 --> 00:01:00.500
So I don't talk about him often

18
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.966
You don't know, it's normal

19
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.200
I'll go up first. OK.

20
00:01:10.166 --> 00:01:11.233
He hates me.

21
00:01:12.666 --> 00:01:13.866
Also normal

22
00:01:18.733 --> 00:01:19.633
Feisusu

23
00:01:20.166 --> 00:01:22.300
Are you coming to the class reunion next week?

24
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.200
Susu

25
00:01:24.266 --> 00:01:27.566
I really have something to do next week, I know, hang up

26
00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:37.066
Okay?

27
00:01:37.866 --> 00:01:40.500
I've known since college that you're not a pond plant

28
00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:41.466
Now it seems...

29
00:01:41.466 --> 00:01:42.400
And so it did.

30
00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:43.800
Let's have a toast

31
00:01:43.866 --> 00:01:44.500
Just lucky

32
00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.866
No, I spelled f before dating 7 years ago.

33
00:01:47.866 --> 00:01:50.700
I guess I regret divorcing Bai Ji to death

34
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.033
Company business

35
00:02:03.166 --> 00:02:04.266
I'll go first

36
00:02:05.966 --> 00:02:07.300
Hey Baijie Baijie

37
00:02:09.133 --> 00:02:10.233
Excuse me?
