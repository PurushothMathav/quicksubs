00:00:01.066 --> 00:00:02.400
How did you get in?

2
00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:03.200
confide

3
00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.200
Susu he gave me the key

4
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:09.833
Ah!

5
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:13.200
So you already know

6
00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:17.666
So many years

7
00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:19.733
You live like that with your little brother alone

8
00:00:19.733 --> 00:00:22.066
Why didn't you tell me?

9
00:00:29.366 --> 00:00:31.833
I thought I had suffered enough

10
00:00:32.266 --> 00:00:33.866
I didn't expect you to suffer more than me

11
00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.966
I can learn to be indifferent

12
00:00:42.966 --> 00:00:44.533
Learn to be cruel

13
00:00:44.533 --> 00:00:46.266
Learn to forget

14
00:00:46.366 --> 00:00:48.500
Don't let people give up

15
00:00:48.666 --> 00:00:52.400
Downpour in my heart

16
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:56.433
We cried and laughed together

17
00:00:59.333 --> 00:01:03.033
In a foreign country, the younger brother needs an identity to go to school

18
00:01:03.066 --> 00:01:06.266
To heal and I see you so happy

19
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.700
I can't bear to bother you.

20
00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.066
Sorry.

21
00:01:14.366 --> 00:01:15.400
Get up.

22
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.700
The food is cold

23
00:01:25.266 --> 00:01:27.166
I'm going to fry the rest of the dishes

24
00:01:42.166 --> 00:01:43.466
Your favorite pork ribs soup

25
00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:45.100
come

26
00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:46.633
You try it

27
00:01:47.333 --> 00:01:48.300
Stomach hasn't changed

28
00:01:56.566 --> 00:01:57.766
Can we make up?

29
00:02:02.566 --> 00:02:04.633
I'm afraid to hold your hand
