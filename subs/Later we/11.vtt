00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:03.400
Mom, why are you here?

2
00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:06.400
Police comrade, please

3
00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:07.166
It's fine

4
00:00:07.166 --> 00:00:08.600
Come on! Go back!

5
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:10.033
Let's see how you react.

6
00:00:11.166 --> 00:00:12.700
I thought it was your child

7
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:15.633
Zhou Huajie

8
00:00:16.466 --> 00:00:17.566
Long time no see.

9
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.200
I know this person personally

10
00:00:21.466 --> 00:00:23.633
Huai Jing, do you know each other?

11
00:00:23.733 --> 00:00:26.266
This is a college classmate

12
00:00:26.733 --> 00:00:28.900
Long time no see

13
00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:30.900
Hello, my name is Siqiyu.

14
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.000
It's Huai Jin's fiancee

15
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.366
Just call me Qi Yu

16
00:00:33.366 --> 00:00:35.100
Hello, my name is Jiangnan Yu.

17
00:00:35.266 --> 00:00:37.966
Oops, let's sign it first.

18
00:00:37.966 --> 00:00:39.333
Wait a long time

19
00:00:39.333 --> 00:00:41.800
You don't know what you have with me all day long

20
00:00:41.966 --> 00:00:43.700
I really put up with it.

21
00:00:43.733 --> 00:00:45.666
It's okay to call this

22
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.100
OK

23
00:00:50.666 --> 00:00:52.966
I heard that you have succeeded in starting a business.

24
00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.066
She is also engaged to such an excellent person as Miss Su

25
00:00:56.133 --> 00:00:58.166
Congratulations, yeah.

26
00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:00.966
Since you left me 7 years ago

27
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.066
I'm working less and less.

28
00:01:06.133 --> 00:01:07.066
It's all you

29
00:01:08.166 --> 00:01:09.300
Dressed like this

30
00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:10.300
Jiang Jiang doesn't care about you anymore

31
00:01:11.166 --> 00:01:12.066
Call you to cheer

32
00:01:18.766 --> 00:01:19.566
All friends

33
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.700
I should have thought this day would come

34
00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.533
Let's go, it's signed

35
00:01:29.533 --> 00:01:31.266
Miss Jiang, where do you live?

36
00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:32.466
Let's send it to you.

37
00:01:32.466 --> 00:01:33.766
That's enough for today.

38
00:01:33.766 --> 00:01:36.000
I'll go back by myself. It's so late.

39
00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:37.566
Don't waste everyone's time

40
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.633
The driver just dropped by

41
00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:42.966
Thank you, Mr. Zhou

42
00:01:43.133 --> 00:01:44.633
But really no need

43
00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:46.700
My husband will come to pick me up
