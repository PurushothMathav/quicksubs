00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:01.200
How is that possible?

2
00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:03.100
Dr. Ye, stop talking nonsense

3
00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:04.466
My dad committed suicide by jumping off a building

4
00:00:04.466 --> 00:00:06.300
I saw the body, how could it be him?

5
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:08.400
Besides, even if my dad was really alive

6
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.333
Why did he poison his own son?

7
00:00:10.333 --> 00:00:13.000
You just said your dad committed suicide by jumping off a building

8
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.000
And beyond recognition

9
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.733
How can you be sure that person is your dad?

10
00:00:15.733 --> 00:00:17.200
The clothes belong to my dad

11
00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.666
And his body shape and what he wears are all his

12
00:00:20.666 --> 00:00:21.600
The clothes belong to your father

13
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:22.900
Can you be sure that person is your father?

14
00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:23.700
Have you done an appraisal?

15
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:26.633
That doesn't mean you mean

16
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:28.733
Your brother doesn't lie

17
00:00:28.733 --> 00:00:31.900
In other words, your father is not dead at all. It's impossible

18
00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.066
Impossible Master Duan

19
00:00:34.266 --> 00:00:36.000
If it was really your dad who poisoned it

20
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.266
Just nod your head.

21
00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:43.300
No.

22
00:00:43.666 --> 00:00:45.700
I don't believe it. I don't believe it.

23
00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:47.000
Even if he were alive

24
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.200
Why did he poison my brother?

25
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.900
Your dad poisoned it

26
00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.200
Ordinary doctors can't cure it

27
00:00:53.333 --> 00:00:55.900
To heal you can only call me

28
00:00:57.966 --> 00:01:00.233
Oops, it's for me

29
00:01:00.966 --> 00:01:02.033
What do you mean?

30
00:01:02.066 --> 00:01:03.600
If I'm not mistaken

31
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.566
Your father is the head of the four families and the sky stick
