00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:05.400
Dr. Ye, how is my dad?

2
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:06.600
Don't bother him yet

3
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:07.466
I have used silver needles

4
00:00:07.466 --> 00:00:09.200
Forced the poison out of his body

5
00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:10.766
But he's still very weak

6
00:00:10.766 --> 00:00:11.600
Still in a coma

7
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:12.900
I won't wake up for a while

8
00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.266
Is he serious?

9
00:00:14.266 --> 00:00:15.700
Of course it's serious.

10
00:00:15.766 --> 00:00:17.133
It was not good to save the disease

11
00:00:17.133 --> 00:00:18.333
Now there is heart poison

12
00:00:18.333 --> 00:00:19.400
This is tricky.

13
00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:20.133
I'll tell you what.

14
00:00:20.133 --> 00:00:21.800
The recovery period should be postponed for at least one month

15
00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.366
And it's impossible to get back to 100%.

16
00:00:24.366 --> 00:00:25.300
There will be inflammation

17
00:00:25.766 --> 00:00:26.800
What!

18
00:00:27.866 --> 00:00:30.300
Hey brother, what are you doing?

19
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.466
What are you doing?

20
00:00:31.466 --> 00:00:34.466
Ye Wushuang's disease was saved by you, if you deserve it

21
00:00:34.466 --> 00:00:35.966
Now my dad has a problem

22
00:00:35.966 --> 00:00:37.400
You can't escape responsibility

23
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.400
If I hadn't saved him, he would have died a few days ago

24
00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:41.466
Don't think I don't

25
00:00:41.933 --> 00:00:44.300
You just can't cure it on purpose, I want to keep taking it.

26
00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:45.366
We break up
