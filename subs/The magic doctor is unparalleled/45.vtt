00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:01.800
What's going on here?

2
00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.500
This doctor asks you to be treated by your father

3
00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:07.200
Is this the attitude of your relatives?

4
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.600
What did I say yesterday?

5
00:00:08.733 --> 00:00:10.900
Kneel down and beg me

6
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:13.766
Dr. Ye

7
00:00:14.333 --> 00:00:15.966
I beg you to treat my father

8
00:00:15.966 --> 00:00:19.533
Your dad is as bedridden as Wushuang said

9
00:00:19.533 --> 00:00:20.366
How is that possible?

10
00:00:20.366 --> 00:00:22.000
Wasn't it fine yesterday?

11
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.200
Yang Wushuang, what spell did you give birth to?

12
00:00:24.333 --> 00:00:26.800
It's not impossible to treat your father

13
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.300
But I have two conditions.

14
00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:29.133
What kind of condition?

15
00:00:29.133 --> 00:00:30.633
You say first

16
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.800
From now on, don't harass my wife again. Second

17
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.500
Drop all your accusations against the Wu family

18
00:00:37.766 --> 00:00:39.900
Ok, I promise you.

19
00:00:40.066 --> 00:00:41.266
Go out and wait

20
00:00:45.133 --> 00:00:46.200
I didn't expect that.

21
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.100
Do I still have this ability?

22
00:00:48.133 --> 00:00:51.466
Oops, you can get the Hu family to kneel for you

23
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.366
Can you cure Mr. Hu's illness?

24
00:00:53.366 --> 00:00:54.966
I can tell he's sick

25
00:00:54.966 --> 00:00:57.000
Can cure him

26
00:00:57.166 --> 00:00:58.233
If so

27
00:00:58.266 --> 00:01:00.100
Then I will also keep my promise.

28
00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:01.400
As of today?

29
00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.866
I will hand over the inheritance of the Wu family to Wushuang

30
00:01:05.166 --> 00:01:07.033
Dead shake, this disagrees with us
