00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.166
My son and I came over today with a special box of gold bars

2
00:00:03.166 --> 00:00:05.266
I proposed to your Wu family

3
00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:06.766
That's right

4
00:00:06.766 --> 00:00:07.900
My son

5
00:00:07.966 --> 00:00:09.533
Fancy your granddaughter

6
00:00:09.533 --> 00:00:11.600
I hope Madam Wu will fulfill it

7
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:14.366
Ouch, does Hu Shao like my eldest granddaughter?

8
00:00:14.366 --> 00:00:15.466
We are flying

9
00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.700
Oh grandma I do

10
00:00:17.966 --> 00:00:18.800
Sit down for me

11
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.433
I like Wu Siyao

12
00:00:20.966 --> 00:00:22.800
You are Wu Yue again

13
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:23.966
Are you finished?

14
00:00:23.966 --> 00:00:25.400
She's my second granddaughter.

15
00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:26.633
Sorry about that.

16
00:00:26.666 --> 00:00:27.900
What about my second granddaughter?

17
00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.000
There's already an engagement, that's fine

18
00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:31.800
Can the marriage contract be revoked?

19
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:33.966
My son has a crush on Wu Siyao

20
00:00:33.966 --> 00:00:36.100
That is the blessing of your Wu family

21
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.466
I hope Madam Wu will fulfill it

22
00:00:38.466 --> 00:00:39.266
President Hu

23
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.733
What about our Wu family?

24
00:00:41.733 --> 00:00:43.100
I really don't have this blessing.

25
00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.400
That's because you don't give me face

26
00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:47.133
It's not about face

27
00:00:47.133 --> 00:00:48.333
This is Mrs. Hu

28
00:00:48.333 --> 00:00:50.300
We didn't come here today to discuss with you

29
00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:51.533
Let's propose marriage

30
00:00:51.533 --> 00:00:52.966
You have to promise

31
00:00:52.966 --> 00:00:54.133
If you don't agree, you have to agree

32
00:00:54.133 --> 00:00:55.600
The person my son likes

33
00:00:55.766 --> 00:00:56.900
No one can escape

34
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.366
Who is so arrogant?
