00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:02.166
Dr. Ye, what happened to my father?

2
00:00:02.166 --> 00:00:04.200
Why did this suddenly happen after drinking the medicine?

3
00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.100
Yes, this is your medicine.

4
00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:14.666
Who made this medicine?

5
00:00:14.666 --> 00:00:16.466
What's wrong with me?

6
00:00:16.466 --> 00:00:17.633
This bowl is poisoned

7
00:00:17.933 --> 00:00:20.000
What, this is yours?

8
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.266
How could it be poisonous?

9
00:00:21.333 --> 00:00:22.000
Don't yell

10
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.333
Let me try with a silver needle

11
00:00:23.333 --> 00:00:24.800
Force the poison out for the old man first

12
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.000
What do you mean try?

13
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.866
Did you just try my dad's life?

14
00:00:27.866 --> 00:00:29.800
Get out and I'll tell you

15
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.366
My dad drank your medicine

16
00:00:31.366 --> 00:00:33.466
Important water and three long and two short

17
00:00:33.466 --> 00:00:34.866
I can't spare you

18
00:00:35.133 --> 00:00:37.200
Okay, let's go

19
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.033
Don't delay Dr. Ye's treatment.
