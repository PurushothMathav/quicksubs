00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:01.966
Yeah, who is this guy?

2
00:00:01.966 --> 00:00:03.800
He's my cousin Wu De

3
00:00:04.566 --> 00:00:07.566
Wu De really lives up to his name

4
00:00:07.566 --> 00:00:09.866
How do you speak

5
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.466
What I say with my mouth

6
00:00:11.466 --> 00:00:12.500
Unlike you

7
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.800
Presumptuous, this is the Wu family

8
00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:16.133
Do you want to be wild?

9
00:00:16.133 --> 00:00:18.800
Fuyang, is this your fiancÃ©?

10
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.500
What is it called Ye Wushuang?

11
00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.400
That's right, he is Ye Wushuang

12
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.700
Why are you dressed like a rag?

13
00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:26.033
I have no money to buy clothes.

14
00:00:26.133 --> 00:00:28.866
Our Wu family is also a famous family now, right?

15
00:00:28.866 --> 00:00:30.300
I really don't understand

16
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.100
What was this now, an amada dog?

17
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:33.500
They all want to enter our Wu family

18
00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.100
Aren't you afraid of losing our Wu family when it gets out?

19
00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.266
Well, if memory serves

20
00:00:38.266 --> 00:00:41.000
This marriage seems to have been promised by your grandfather, right?

21
00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.300
Then you say you are scolding me?

22
00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.966
Are you still questioning your grandfather?

23
00:00:45.966 --> 00:00:47.966
Okay, boy, let me ask you

24
00:00:47.966 --> 00:00:49.700
What family are you from?

25
00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.100
How many companies do you have?

26
00:00:52.266 --> 00:00:53.366
I have no family.

27
00:00:53.466 --> 00:00:54.300
Alone

28
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.566
Also a homeless

29
00:00:55.566 --> 00:00:58.000
Now I'm waiting to join your Wu family

30
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.233
Then take over the Wu family's products together with Siyao

31
00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.400
How do you understand that?

32
00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:05.666
Did you hear that?

33
00:01:05.666 --> 00:01:06.500
Do you hear me?

34
00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:07.966
That's what people say.

35
00:01:07.966 --> 00:01:10.100
Can such a person fit into my family?

36
00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:11.500
Think about it.
