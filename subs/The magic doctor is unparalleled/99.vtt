00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:01.200
I don't know.

2
00:00:01.533 --> 00:00:04.300
Maybe there's no evidence of seniority at all

3
00:00:04.466 --> 00:00:05.500
This is just

4
00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:08.133
Is it because he wants to suppress one bloodline of the four major families?

5
00:00:08.133 --> 00:00:10.000
Just a blank sheet of paper

6
00:00:10.366 --> 00:00:11.566
Let the four families

7
00:00:11.566 --> 00:00:14.166
I haven't had a good night's sleep in 20 years

8
00:00:14.333 --> 00:00:16.800
Finally going to perish

9
00:00:17.366 --> 00:00:18.800
Remember now?

10
00:00:18.866 --> 00:00:20.833
It's kind of funny yeah

11
00:00:20.933 --> 00:00:22.200
But it doesn't matter.

12
00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:23.966
They are now guilty of a crime

13
00:00:24.066 --> 00:00:25.933
None of the four families can escape

14
00:00:25.933 --> 00:00:28.266
They will surely be severely criticized by the law

15
00:00:28.366 --> 00:00:31.066
Okay, that's your revenge

16
00:00:31.066 --> 00:00:34.366
Hey, when will you and Siyao get married?

17
00:00:34.366 --> 00:00:35.500
Master early next month

18
00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.666
Then you must come to marry me

19
00:00:37.666 --> 00:00:39.300
Definitely. Definitely.

20
00:00:45.733 --> 00:00:48.233
Are you excited to get married tomorrow?

21
00:00:48.366 --> 00:00:51.233
Guess what, no matter what happens in the future

22
00:00:51.266 --> 00:00:52.800
I will always love you

23
00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:54.433
I will love you forever

24
00:00:54.733 --> 00:00:56.866
I want you to be the happiest woman

25
00:01:07.066 --> 00:01:09.166
Hey master, I found something

26
00:01:09.166 --> 00:01:10.100
So what's up?

27
00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.700
Uh, I turned to your grandfather's year

28
00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:14.366
A book sent to me

29
00:01:14.533 --> 00:01:18.000
I wrote a line of words in an inconspicuous position

30
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.000
What is written?

31
00:01:19.066 --> 00:01:21.366
He said that if years later

32
00:01:21.366 --> 00:01:23.033
You are at the Swiss bank

33
00:01:23.066 --> 00:01:25.166
The evidence I got was a blank slate

34
00:01:25.166 --> 00:01:25.900
Then prove it

35
00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:29.200
What you see may not be the whole truth.

36
00:01:29.333 --> 00:01:32.066
What do you mean?

37
00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.833
The four families may not be the final truth

38
00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.366
Master, you wait

39
00:01:38.366 --> 00:01:39.800
We'll be right there
