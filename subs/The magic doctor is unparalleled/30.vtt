00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:02.900
What did you say for me to pick it up?

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.666
You are rubbish

3
00:00:04.666 --> 00:00:07.300
What you sent is also rubbish.

4
00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:08.700
I asked you to pick it up for me

5
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.266
What if I don't pick it up?

6
00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:13.800
What are you talking about?

7
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.000
Ouch, hey, hey.

8
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.566
Don't come, come

9
00:00:18.366 --> 00:00:21.766
Come and sit down, come and sit down, you probably all sit down

10
00:00:23.466 --> 00:00:24.966
What didn't you say just now?

11
00:00:24.966 --> 00:00:26.166
I heard it outside

12
00:00:26.166 --> 00:00:28.533
Then grandma, let me introduce you again.

13
00:00:28.533 --> 00:00:30.200
This is the four-angle fiancÃ©

14
00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:31.766
What is it called Ye Wushuang?

15
00:00:31.766 --> 00:00:33.200
Are you Ye Wushuang?

16
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Sure enough, he is very talented. Thank you, grandma.

17
00:00:37.666 --> 00:00:39.166
Let's go grandma

18
00:00:39.333 --> 00:00:40.700
Grandma, think about it.

19
00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.333
Wearing a lot of street goods to see you

20
00:00:42.333 --> 00:00:44.300
This obviously doesn't take you seriously.

21
00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:45.266
Disrespect you

22
00:00:45.266 --> 00:00:48.066
And quite literally, he's unemployed.

23
00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.466
I just want to join our Wujiachi County seat

24
00:00:50.466 --> 00:00:51.700
Look at this

25
00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:52.500
Wu De

26
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:53.833
Where are you talking
