00:00:03.166 --> 00:00:04.600
Master master

2
00:00:06.333 --> 00:00:09.533
Peerless, I travel everywhere, don't have to find me

3
00:00:09.533 --> 00:00:11.966
You don't have to lose your background

4
00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:14.966
Remember to let go to resist

5
00:00:27.566 --> 00:00:30.366
Buddha said, you masters?

6
00:00:30.366 --> 00:00:32.300
Sit here motionless

7
00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:34.033
Don't eat or drink for a day

8
00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:38.100
Now you medical students have started to cultivate immortals

9
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.400
I'll tell you what.

10
00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:43.566
I don't move you now because you are useful

11
00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.166
You give me a good life

12
00:00:45.166 --> 00:00:48.266
I might consider nine corpses
