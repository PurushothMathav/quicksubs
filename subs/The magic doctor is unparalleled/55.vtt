00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:01.400
You are such a weirdo

2
00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:02.766
Your pig head

3
00:00:02.766 --> 00:00:04.000
How dare you scold

4
00:00:04.733 --> 00:00:06.600
Brother, what are you doing?

5
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.433
It's definitely this kid's fault

6
00:00:08.566 --> 00:00:09.433
Thank you doctor

7
00:00:09.566 --> 00:00:10.466
Don't get me wrong.

8
00:00:10.466 --> 00:00:11.766
My brother didn't mean that

9
00:00:11.766 --> 00:00:12.900
What doesn't that mean?

10
00:00:13.266 --> 00:00:14.400
That's what I'm saying.

11
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.566
You don't even move your pig brain to think about it

12
00:00:16.566 --> 00:00:18.133
If I were to kill my wife

13
00:00:18.133 --> 00:00:20.266
I have a thousand ways to let him die

14
00:00:20.266 --> 00:00:23.366
As for me to poison with such a despicable means?

15
00:00:23.366 --> 00:00:24.200
You say like

16
00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:27.233
Anyway, you can't tell me about this.

17
00:00:27.666 --> 00:00:30.766
You're not done, you can go and test it, pig head.

18
00:00:30.766 --> 00:00:32.500
You can do it bro

19
00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:35.866
Anyway, this was definitely not done on the 11th night

20
00:00:35.866 --> 00:00:36.666
still

21
00:00:36.966 --> 00:00:37.933
Want me to say

22
00:00:37.933 --> 00:00:40.066
It's my prescription that has been tampered with

23
00:00:40.133 --> 00:00:40.966
How is that possible?

24
00:00:41.266 --> 00:00:43.166
The medicine has always belonged to me and my sister

25
00:00:44.133 --> 00:00:46.533
Are you suspecting me and my sister?

26
00:00:46.533 --> 00:00:49.266
I ask you are you sure

27
00:00:49.266 --> 00:00:51.733
Did you and your sister touch that bowl of medicine?

28
00:00:51.733 --> 00:00:53.300
Are you sure?
