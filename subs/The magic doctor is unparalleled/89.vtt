00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:03.600
Brother, you are awake

2
00:00:04.066 --> 00:00:06.400
Doctor, thank you so much

3
00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:09.600
brother

4
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.266
Doctor, my brother, does he want to talk?

5
00:00:13.366 --> 00:00:15.933
Why is the poison in Young Master Duan too toxic?

6
00:00:15.933 --> 00:00:17.300
It has hurt his throat

7
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:18.900
In the short term he will be unable to speak

8
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:19.900
Can only recover slowly

9
00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:21.733
Poisoned people are so hateful

10
00:00:21.733 --> 00:00:24.233
The person who poisoned must be someone close to Young Master Duan

11
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:25.933
Why do you say so?

12
00:00:25.933 --> 00:00:28.200
The poison in Young Master Duan is a chronic poison

13
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.000
Slowly introduced into the body by gas

14
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.400
Go through the skull at least three times

15
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:32.233
and

16
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.966
The dead must have had long-term contact with Young Master Duan

17
00:00:34.966 --> 00:00:36.466
So I concluded

18
00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.533
The person who poisoned must be familiar to Young Master Duan

19
00:00:38.533 --> 00:00:39.333
close person

20
00:00:39.333 --> 00:00:41.933
But since my dad passed away

21
00:00:41.933 --> 00:00:43.966
My brother doesn't have anyone close to him anymore.

22
00:00:43.966 --> 00:00:45.566
Your father committed suicide by jumping off a building

23
00:00:46.366 --> 00:00:49.366
When the body was found

24
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.700
It's beyond recognition.

25
00:00:55.533 --> 00:00:58.100
Dr. Ye, it seems that my brother still wants to talk

26
00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:59.700
He must know the poisoned life

27
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:02.600
Go find the carton pen and let him write it down
