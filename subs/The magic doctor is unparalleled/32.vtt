00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.400
Nonsense, you really gave it to me

2
00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:04.400
Sorry grandma

3
00:00:04.733 --> 00:00:05.800
Time is running out

4
00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:07.966
Wushuang didn't have time to prepare the gift properly

5
00:00:08.066 --> 00:00:09.900
Don't blame him.

6
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.266
Is it a matter of time?

7
00:00:11.266 --> 00:00:13.100
Ah, this obviously doesn't put us

8
00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:14.133
Priceless in the eyes

9
00:00:14.133 --> 00:00:16.733
That's what's going to spread

10
00:00:16.733 --> 00:00:19.333
How can our Wu family have the face to meet people in the future?

11
00:00:19.333 --> 00:00:20.366
Are you done?

12
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:21.600
That's it, it's my turn

13
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.066
This is the Chinese medicine I carefully prepared for my grandmother

14
00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:25.700
Treat grandma's headache

15
00:00:26.133 --> 00:00:28.566
Although it only cost a few dozen dollars when I bought it.

16
00:00:28.566 --> 00:00:31.100
But I promise its value.

17
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:32.533
Worth millions

18
00:00:32.533 --> 00:00:34.166
You know what?

19
00:00:34.166 --> 00:00:37.066
Why don't you say this bag is priceless?

20
00:00:37.066 --> 00:00:38.566
How did you know I had scalp disease?

21
00:00:38.566 --> 00:00:40.466
Of course and I also know

22
00:00:40.466 --> 00:00:42.400
Your headache has been bothering you for years

23
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:43.766
Now more and more

24
00:00:44.166 --> 00:00:46.100
So I promise you.

25
00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:47.366
This bag is important

26
00:00:47.366 --> 00:00:49.200
He must be going out of business

27
00:00:49.733 --> 00:00:50.966
It really works.

28
00:00:50.966 --> 00:00:54.333
Hey, don't listen to him.

29
00:00:54.333 --> 00:00:55.600
What is this bag?

30
00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:56.566
If this bag is curative

31
00:00:56.566 --> 00:00:59.300
So what do the experts we invite do?

32
00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:00.300
I see

33
00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.800
This is the possibility of a little doctor's wild wolf.

34
00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.266
The other party is a poison

35
00:01:05.333 --> 00:01:07.666
Whether there is a cure or not will be known in 5 minutes

36
00:01:07.966 --> 00:01:10.200
Grandma looks at your complexion

37
00:01:10.266 --> 00:01:11.500
You have never
