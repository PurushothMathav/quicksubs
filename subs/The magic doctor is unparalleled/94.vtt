00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:02.533
Why are there dozens of people in a family?

2
00:00:02.533 --> 00:00:04.633
I was so cruelly hurt by you

3
00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:08.700
It's not all my fault, but your grandfather's.

4
00:00:08.733 --> 00:00:10.866
Who made him move my cake?

5
00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:12.600
Can I let him go?

6
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.000
What a pity!

7
00:00:14.133 --> 00:00:16.200
You were born a fish who slipped through the net

8
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:17.333
Oh, my God.

9
00:00:17.333 --> 00:00:20.000
I live in fear

10
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.000
People like you

11
00:00:21.266 --> 00:00:23.000
Should have gone to hell early

12
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.500
Hahaha, what a pity!

13
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.500
It's your grandfather, not me.

14
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.533
Everything after I came down the mountain was deliberately set by you

15
00:00:30.533 --> 00:00:33.566
Really? I just didn't expect it to be so hard for you.

16
00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.000
I almost fell into your hands

17
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.266
It still forces me to describe it this way.

18
00:00:41.133 --> 00:00:44.166
Do you think you can escape today, young man?

19
00:00:44.166 --> 00:00:46.900
Don't think that you are amazing if you have a little ability

20
00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:50.400
Back then, I could beat your grandfather

21
00:00:50.933 --> 00:00:53.666
I can fight you today

22
00:00:54.666 --> 00:00:56.466
Don't even think about leaving here alive

23
00:00:56.466 --> 00:00:57.266
Dad?

24
00:00:57.733 --> 00:00:59.000
I don't care who you are.

25
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.833
I don't care what happens to you

26
00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.233
Dr. Ye, he saved your life?

27
00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:04.700
You can't embarrass him

28
00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:05.600
What do you know?

29
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.000
Go back so you don't get your eyes dirty

30
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.466
Dr. Ye is a good man

31
00:01:09.466 --> 00:01:10.766
Don't do this to him.

32
00:01:10.766 --> 00:01:12.766
Enough, you know what a good person is

33
00:01:12.766 --> 00:01:13.766
What is a bad person?

34
00:01:13.766 --> 00:01:15.233
In my eyes

35
00:01:15.566 --> 00:01:18.200
Only you get out
