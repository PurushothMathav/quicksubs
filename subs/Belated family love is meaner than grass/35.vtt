00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:03.466
I heard from Dean Wang that someone is embarrassing you

2
00:00:03.466 --> 00:00:05.333
I specially came to see

3
00:00:05.333 --> 00:00:08.466
Also, I have already sent an invitation.

4
00:00:08.466 --> 00:00:11.500
Three days later, a dinner party will be held at Jufu Pavilion

5
00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:15.233
Publicly announce that you inherit Huacan Group

6
00:00:16.333 --> 00:00:18.566
Can'er, you finally found your grandfather

7
00:00:18.566 --> 00:00:20.233
Don't get mad anymore

8
00:00:21.133 --> 00:00:22.766
Mom, don't worry.

9
00:00:22.766 --> 00:00:24.933
I will never forget the kindness of your upbringing

10
00:00:24.933 --> 00:00:26.666
Dinner in three days

11
00:00:26.966 --> 00:00:28.666
For Caner

12
00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:31.800
The most important moment of his life

13
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.400
Please also attend

14
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.966
I really want to go

15
00:00:37.266 --> 00:00:39.500
But my body doesn't allow it

16
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.166
When I recover

17
00:00:41.166 --> 00:00:42.900
Celebrate with Cang'er again

18
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:46.800
Eh

19
00:00:48.933 --> 00:00:50.566
How did that happen?

20
00:00:50.766 --> 00:00:52.733
Let you bring that rebel back

21
00:00:52.733 --> 00:00:53.900
Is it that hard?

22
00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:56.866
Dad, who knew that Dr. Zhao was arrested for taking bribes?

23
00:00:56.866 --> 00:00:57.866
Can't you forget the way?

24
00:00:57.933 --> 00:01:00.100
It must be that trash who is deliberately infinite

25
00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.766
Dr. Zhao, if there is no real evidence

26
00:01:02.766 --> 00:01:04.300
Just by Xiao Can's threat

27
00:01:04.333 --> 00:01:06.266
How could he possibly take someone away?

28
00:01:06.266 --> 00:01:08.166
Why do you do it twice?

29
00:01:08.166 --> 00:01:10.566
Speak for the wife who feels out of the house

30
00:01:10.566 --> 00:01:11.200
I'm angry with you on purpose

31
00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.900
Dad, I told him

32
00:01:13.733 --> 00:01:15.733
What time is it now? Are you still arguing?

33
00:01:15.733 --> 00:01:17.066
I'm just trying to figure it out.

34
00:01:17.066 --> 00:01:19.500
What did that bad boy say to Huacan Group?

35
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.566
How could Huacan Group be so ruthless?

36
00:01:21.566 --> 00:01:23.000
Cut off our Jiang family's way of life

37
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.766
Wait for Huacan Group

38
00:01:24.766 --> 00:01:26.666
Do you remember your brother's name?
