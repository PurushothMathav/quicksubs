00:00:03.133 --> 00:00:04.566
Oops oops

2
00:00:04.566 --> 00:00:05.700
I'm pissed off.

3
00:00:06.166 --> 00:00:08.200
I didn't expect that trash to really take Company Commander Wang

4
00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:09.966
Please come and remember Xiao Wang

5
00:00:10.133 --> 00:00:11.900
If he doesn't go to the flower group to explain

6
00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:13.866
Our family is going to be completely over, petty bourgeoisie

7
00:00:13.933 --> 00:00:16.100
Maybe we really have a misunderstanding about small meals

8
00:00:16.366 --> 00:00:17.900
What nonsense are you talking about?

9
00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:19.300
Dean Wang said

10
00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.700
Dr. Zhao was taken away for taking bribes

11
00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:23.800
Is it possible that he was bribed to pay attention?

12
00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.900
And framing Xiaocai does not have the bone marrow of Juejian?

13
00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.100
Hey, sister, why would you doubt Xiaolin?

14
00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:29.966
He's the kid we grew up with.

15
00:00:29.966 --> 00:00:31.566
Besides, he even saved my life

16
00:00:31.566 --> 00:00:32.100
You forgot

17
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:34.766
I remember you telling me once you fell into the water

18
00:00:34.766 --> 00:00:36.366
If it wasn't for Kobayashi, you would die

19
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.866
But that doesn't mean Xiao Can will harm us.

20
00:00:38.866 --> 00:00:40.966
I always felt that he was extremely disappointed in his father

21
00:00:40.966 --> 00:00:42.400
I don't want to go back to the Jiang family

22
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.366
Rather than really wanting to harm the Jiang family

23
00:00:44.466 --> 00:00:46.866
Sister, you are too kind.

24
00:00:46.866 --> 00:00:48.200
Don't think so well of him.

25
00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:49.000
Don't you forget

26
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.933
He stole something on the first day he came to the Jiang family

27
00:00:50.933 --> 00:00:52.966
You said that if he has grievances, he can tell us.

28
00:00:52.966 --> 00:00:54.200
Then he said nothing

29
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:55.933
No, I just want to take away the family property

30
00:00:55.933 --> 00:00:57.266
To get revenge on the auntie nearby

31
00:00:57.266 --> 00:00:59.400
But oh no but

32
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:00.966
He almost brought his family to death

33
00:01:00.966 --> 00:01:02.300
Don't speak for him, okay?

34
00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:03.766
Oops, let's go, let's go
