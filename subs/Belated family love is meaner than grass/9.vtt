00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:03.666
Dad, trust me

2
00:00:03.666 --> 00:00:06.266
Hmm old man

3
00:00:06.266 --> 00:00:08.000
Don't be deceived by him.

4
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.833
Yeah, Dad

5
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.266
You said you were going to break off the father-son relationship with him

6
00:00:15.166 --> 00:00:16.100
shut up

7
00:00:19.666 --> 00:00:22.700
Son, Dad knows that you have been wronged over the years

8
00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:25.366
But it is also to train you into talent as soon as possible

9
00:00:25.366 --> 00:00:27.666
I hope you don't blame Dad.

10
00:00:27.866 --> 00:00:29.100
I don't blame you.

11
00:00:38.666 --> 00:00:41.100
But they tried to kill me.

12
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.733
He also bullied me and raised me

13
00:00:42.733 --> 00:00:44.566
I have to get justice.

14
00:00:44.966 --> 00:00:46.000
Forget it, Can'er

15
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.800
Don't make my house unpleasant for me

16
00:00:48.866 --> 00:00:51.766
If you dare to bully you and Can'er, you should be punished

17
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:52.700
That Canger

18
00:00:52.733 --> 00:00:55.366
I'm up to you what you want to do with them

19
00:00:55.566 --> 00:00:58.200
They bullied my foster mother and should kowtow and apologize

20
00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:59.866
They tried to kill me in the hospital

21
00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.466
Go to prison to repent and atone for your sins

22
00:01:02.466 --> 00:01:02.766
XiaoLi

23
00:01:02.766 --> 00:01:04.800
It is the child of our Jiang family who has been in pain since childhood

24
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.000
Did you kneel down and go to jail with just one word?

25
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.766
How can you let him live in that place?

26
00:01:08.766 --> 00:01:11.333
What about me? How have I lived all these years?

27
00:01:11.333 --> 00:01:14.066
The old man just wants to seize the property

28
00:01:14.066 --> 00:01:15.800
There is no room for us orphans and widows

29
00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:16.700
shut up

30
00:01:16.966 --> 00:01:19.300
Can'er is not the kind of person with a small belly

31
00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:21.300
You must be angry

32
00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.400
Can'er's father will definitely get justice for you

33
00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.833
But Dad remembers that tomorrow is your birthday, Mom.

34
00:01:28.366 --> 00:01:30.466
Do you still remember my birthday?

35
00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.800
Dad has been watching you all these years

36
00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.733
I've always wanted to take you back to the Jiang family

37
00:01:34.733 --> 00:01:36.800
It just so happens that tomorrow is your birthday.

38
00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.600
Let Dad make up for all these years of regret first

39
00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.000
After your birthday

40
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.566
Announce that you will take over the Jiang family and then deal with it

41
00:01:43.566 --> 00:01:44.866
Their mother and son are not ashamed

42
00:01:44.933 --> 00:01:46.066
Before birthday

43
00:01:46.133 --> 00:01:47.433
I don't want to spoil the party.
