00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.400
I didn't apologize to you.

2
00:00:02.666 --> 00:00:03.600
I am to you

3
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.600
Even compared to my own brother Chen Huachan

4
00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:06.500
tighter

5
00:00:06.966 --> 00:00:09.066
You're going to give me to an old man

6
00:00:09.666 --> 00:00:11.466
Has your conscience been eaten by a dog?

7
00:00:11.466 --> 00:00:12.566
Hey no no no no

8
00:00:12.733 --> 00:00:15.466
Second sister, that bad old man is very rich

9
00:00:15.466 --> 00:00:17.400
He can give us money, you know?

10
00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.400
Besides, you're good to me

11
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.466
That's because you were playing by the lake three years ago

12
00:00:23.466 --> 00:00:25.733
Almost stumbled and fell into the water and lost his life

13
00:00:25.733 --> 00:00:27.366
After being rescued by others

14
00:00:27.366 --> 00:00:28.966
What you see is me

15
00:00:28.966 --> 00:00:30.700
Treat me as your savior

16
00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:32.000
You are good to me

17
00:00:32.533 --> 00:00:33.700
What do you mean?

18
00:00:34.566 --> 00:00:36.400
It wasn't you who saved me back then

19
00:00:36.533 --> 00:00:37.333
Humph

20
00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:39.366
To tell you the truth

21
00:00:39.366 --> 00:00:42.233
I was the one who pushed you into the water

22
00:00:43.533 --> 00:00:46.066
What, three years ago?

23
00:00:46.333 --> 00:00:47.900
You are playing by the lake

24
00:00:49.166 --> 00:00:49.900
Oh, right.

25
00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.633
It seems to be near Chen Huacan's adoptive mother's house

26
00:00:52.933 --> 00:00:54.666
I'll follow you.

27
00:00:55.266 --> 00:00:58.100
I thought you were going to take Chen Huacan back to the Jiang family

28
00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.033
Then I pushed you off

29
00:01:00.266 --> 00:01:01.300
Hide not far away

30
00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.866
Watching you struggle bit by bit in the water

31
00:01:04.866 --> 00:01:07.000
You're trying to kill me, not save me

32
00:01:08.866 --> 00:01:10.800
Then who is my savior?

33
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.100
You want to know?

34
00:01:12.266 --> 00:01:14.433
Fine, I'll tell you.

35
00:01:14.466 --> 00:01:17.433
It's your own brother, Chen Kuangce.
