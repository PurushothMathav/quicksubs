00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:01.933
I was about to report to you on Smooth Bank

2
00:00:01.933 --> 00:00:02.700
No, nothing else.

3
00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.400
I would like to ask whether you froze the assets of the Jiang family

4
00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:06.866
You already know

5
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:09.366
That's right, I heard that the Jiang family doesn't enter you

6
00:00:09.366 --> 00:00:11.400
Plus they don't have a project to force you to go out of business

7
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.266
I just froze their funds

8
00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:14.533
Let them accelerate bankruptcy

9
00:00:14.533 --> 00:00:15.766
Not to please me

10
00:00:15.766 --> 00:00:17.366
Freeze their Jiang family's assets

11
00:00:17.366 --> 00:00:18.400
Do you understand?

12
00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:20.166
Understand

13
00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.433
Ah, Aunt Liu

14
00:00:29.366 --> 00:00:32.300
Why did you buy so many dishes?

15
00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:35.666
My sister wants to make some soup for my father to replenish his body

16
00:00:35.766 --> 00:00:36.333
Besides

17
00:00:36.333 --> 00:00:38.800
Chen Huachan asked Guanghua Bank to freeze our money

18
00:00:39.333 --> 00:00:41.733
We are also going to invite the president of Guanghua Bank to come over

19
00:00:41.733 --> 00:00:43.900
I hope he can unblock the Zhang family's funds

20
00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.066
Aunt Liu Xiaoli

21
00:00:47.666 --> 00:00:49.233
The Jiang family is fortunate to have you

22
00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:51.300
Ah!

23
00:00:51.533 --> 00:00:55.066
Do we also want to do more for the Jiang family?

24
00:00:55.066 --> 00:00:56.400
Oh, by the way, second sister

25
00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:00.966
How about you try this red wine?

26
00:01:01.933 --> 00:01:03.866
I have to go to the hospital for a while

27
00:01:03.866 --> 00:01:05.300
Why don't you drink the wine first?

28
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.700
Oops, second sister

29
00:01:06.766 --> 00:01:08.733
You have the most research on red wine

30
00:01:08.733 --> 00:01:10.800
Taste if this is suitable for entertaining the president

31
00:01:10.866 --> 00:01:12.433
Oh, what?

32
00:01:12.766 --> 00:01:14.333
I've saved your life before

33
00:01:14.333 --> 00:01:16.133
Could it be that you are still afraid that I will hurt you?

34
00:01:16.133 --> 00:01:18.366
Xiaolin, what are you talking about?

35
00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.400
How could I be afraid of you hurting me?

36
00:01:26.466 --> 00:01:27.500
Yeah, might as well.

37
00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:38.900
Kobayashi

38
00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.700
How did this wine end up?
