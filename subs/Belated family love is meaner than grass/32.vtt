00:00:02.966 --> 00:00:04.700
Dean Wang, why are you here?

2
00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:06.800
Engraving someone reported you for taking bribes

3
00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:08.266
Sit tight, please accept the investigation

4
00:00:08.266 --> 00:00:09.900
Well, no Dean Wang

5
00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.900
Dean Dean

6
00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:11.800
Let me explain.

7
00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.500
The dean is wronged, wronged

8
00:00:18.766 --> 00:00:20.666
Dean Wang, why are you here?

9
00:00:20.666 --> 00:00:22.200
I was notified

10
00:00:22.266 --> 00:00:25.266
Replace Zhao Ke to see a doctor for Ms. Chen Qiuju

11
00:00:25.266 --> 00:00:26.466
How is that possible?

12
00:00:26.466 --> 00:00:28.300
Can't remember the last moment

13
00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:30.166
Don't define it. It's impossible.

14
00:00:30.166 --> 00:00:32.333
How could a poor man like him be as poor as Dean Wang?

15
00:00:32.333 --> 00:00:33.300
Rich or poor

16
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.133
As long as you get sick

17
00:00:34.133 --> 00:00:36.133
As a doctor, you have a duty to treat them

18
00:00:36.133 --> 00:00:38.400
Your previous attending doctor was suspected of taking bribes

19
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.300
Perjury has been taken away for investigation

20
00:00:40.333 --> 00:00:41.400
It's true.

21
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:42.300
Will be fired

22
00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.700
Your follow-up treatment will be my sole responsibility

23
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.233
Guaranteed recovery

24
00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:47.566
Thank you Dean Wang

25
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.066
That's impossible.

26
00:00:49.066 --> 00:00:50.300
Dean Wang

27
00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:51.600
My mom still needs to remember

28
00:00:51.733 --> 00:00:52.966
Please go out
