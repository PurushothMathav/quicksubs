00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.900
The jewelry stolen 5 years ago has been restored

2
00:00:11.933 --> 00:00:12.733
younger brother

3
00:00:16.133 --> 00:00:17.833
Brother, what are you doing?

4
00:00:19.266 --> 00:00:22.766
Ahhhhh

5
00:00:24.266 --> 00:00:26.066
Dad, what's the matter?

6
00:00:26.333 --> 00:00:29.200
My third brother won't let him return the watch in his head

7
00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:32.400
He hit me, I didn't

8
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.933
Did not steal

9
00:00:37.933 --> 00:00:39.833
I didn't steal Dad's watch. Why do you have it?

10
00:00:40.066 --> 00:00:41.800
Your hands and feet must be dirty.

11
00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.133
I want to take my dad's things

12
00:00:43.133 --> 00:00:45.000
To fool around with the wrong people in society?

13
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.500
Dad, he framed me

14
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:47.633
He framed me

15
00:00:49.466 --> 00:00:51.500
I don't regret my mistakes

16
00:00:51.533 --> 00:00:53.066
How dare you frame your brother?

17
00:00:53.066 --> 00:00:54.566
Hey husband

18
00:00:54.666 --> 00:00:57.366
Hua Can, he just returned to this house and is not used to it.

19
00:00:57.366 --> 00:01:00.133
Uh, you can pretend that Xiaoli stole this watch.

20
00:01:00.133 --> 00:01:01.700
Don't embarrass Hua Can

21
00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.233
Huacan, this watch is your father's favorite

22
00:01:05.266 --> 00:01:06.900
You don't have enough money to go out and play

23
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.133
I can give you Xiaoli's pocket money.

24
00:01:09.133 --> 00:01:11.100
You can't steal your belongings?

25
00:01:11.866 --> 00:01:12.966
It's not that I can't

26
00:01:12.966 --> 00:01:15.366
The general can't tolerate a thief like you

27
00:01:15.366 --> 00:01:17.266
Go back to your foster mother today

28
00:01:17.366 --> 00:01:19.300
When will you get rid of the nausea of stealing?

29
00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:20.366
Come back later.

30
00:01:21.866 --> 00:01:22.900
Hey brother

31
00:01:23.266 --> 00:01:24.700
Dad is also for your own good

32
00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:25.866
I don't want you to know

33
00:01:25.866 --> 00:01:28.133
Because you are the second generation of rich, you are squandering

34
00:01:28.133 --> 00:01:29.866
Just listen to dad

35
00:01:29.866 --> 00:01:32.800
Yeah, your dad is also well-intentioned

36
00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.500
Do you want to remodel it well?

37
00:01:34.566 --> 00:01:37.866
Let's go, the general has no room for thieves

38
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.933
You are really the son I hold in the palm of my hand

39
00:02:08.933 --> 00:02:10.633
You really know how to pretend, don't you?
