00:00:01.666 --> 00:00:03.200
It's okay.

2
00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:05.566
Thank you Dean Wang

3
00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:12.100
Can'er

4
00:00:12.733 --> 00:00:14.300
What the hell is going on?

5
00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:16.100
Why did your eldest sister and your second sister

6
00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:18.000
I've been pestering you to go back to the Jiang family

7
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.133
Why did Dean Wang suddenly treat me?

8
00:00:20.133 --> 00:00:21.900
Mom, I said don't be angry.

9
00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.333
The Jiang family held a birthday party yesterday

10
00:00:23.333 --> 00:00:24.700
It wasn't given to me at all

11
00:00:24.766 --> 00:00:25.800
It's for that Gangneung

12
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.800
And I obviously donated the bone marrow

13
00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:28.966
None of them believed it.

14
00:00:28.966 --> 00:00:30.700
He broke with me on the spot.

15
00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:34.300
Why does the Jiang family still have the face to come to you like this?

16
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:36.933
Mom is over

17
00:00:36.933 --> 00:00:38.933
Anyway, I've completely cut ties with them

18
00:00:38.933 --> 00:00:40.666
As for Dean Wang, he is my grandfather

19
00:00:40.666 --> 00:00:42.900
My grandfather is the chairperson of Huacan Group

20
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:44.400
It was he who invited Dean Wang over

21
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.400
It's just that they don't believe it at all

22
00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:47.566
You just said

23
00:00:47.566 --> 00:00:50.300
Your grandfather is the chairperson of Huacan Group

24
00:00:51.133 --> 00:00:52.133
I was wondering.

25
00:00:52.133 --> 00:00:54.566
That's the number one group in the world by market capitalization

26
00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:56.066
How is that possible?

27
00:00:56.066 --> 00:00:58.033
Nothing is impossible

28
00:00:58.366 --> 00:01:01.300
He is my long-lost grandson

29
00:01:01.366 --> 00:01:03.200
Recall that this is my mom

30
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.966
Thank you for replacing my daughter all these years

31
00:01:06.966 --> 00:01:09.700
Take such good care of Can'er

32
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.800
Chairperson, you are welcome.

33
00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.166
Can'er is sensible and kind

34
00:01:13.166 --> 00:01:16.200
Thanks to her for accompanying me to make money all these years

35
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.066
Heal me

36
00:01:17.066 --> 00:01:19.366
I can catch my breath

37
00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.866
Wei Gong, what's the matter with you today?
