00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:03.400
It's been gone since my daughter died

2
00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:04.800
Haven't seen you in so many years

3
00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:07.400
I didn't expect you to have achieved a little success

4
00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:10.100
But you shouldn't forget your roots.

5
00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:13.766
You shouldn't have cut ties with your own son

6
00:00:14.466 --> 00:00:17.000
Can'er don't be afraid

7
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.833
Today is your birthday

8
00:00:19.066 --> 00:00:22.600
This is your birthday present from your grandfather.

9
00:00:22.733 --> 00:00:25.100
He's really your ex-wife's father

10
00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:26.100
So what if I was?

11
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:27.900
This old thing used to be awesome

12
00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.700
But look at the birthday present he prepared.

13
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:31.100
Just leave a broken egg

14
00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:33.866
It seems that there is no comeback after bankruptcy

15
00:00:33.866 --> 00:00:34.600
But

16
00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.966
We are the top cooperation with Huacan Group

17
00:00:36.966 --> 00:00:38.166
Don't be afraid of the rich

18
00:00:38.166 --> 00:00:39.800
Yeah, it looks like a little breakup

19
00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.500
Don't take it seriously at all

20
00:00:43.566 --> 00:00:45.733
Brother, why did you make him unfilial?

21
00:00:45.733 --> 00:00:47.766
It is only right that we kick him out of the Jiang family

22
00:00:47.766 --> 00:00:49.466
And it's my family business

23
00:00:49.466 --> 00:00:51.266
When is it your turn to step in?

24
00:00:51.266 --> 00:00:52.500
Arrogance

25
00:00:52.533 --> 00:00:54.866
It must have been this trash who knew he was being squeezed out

26
00:00:54.866 --> 00:00:55.266
Zombie

27
00:00:55.266 --> 00:00:57.866
That's why I deliberately let this old man come over to make trouble

28
00:00:57.866 --> 00:01:00.300
They want to damage our zombie business

29
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.466
More corruption to get money

30
00:01:01.466 --> 00:01:04.200
I don't look down on your Jiangjiang money in foreign countries at all
