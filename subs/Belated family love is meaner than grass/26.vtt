00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:02.366
Have you had enough trouble?

2
00:00:02.366 --> 00:00:05.466
It's your sister who's making trouble

3
00:00:05.466 --> 00:00:08.066
The more we begged him, the more he pushed his luck.

4
00:00:08.066 --> 00:00:09.866
We've run out of shelter

5
00:00:09.866 --> 00:00:11.966
You will definitely come back to us crying

6
00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:13.566
Wait a minute.

7
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:16.966
I knew you were bluffing.

8
00:00:16.966 --> 00:00:20.366
Don't you have to roll back in the end?

9
00:00:20.366 --> 00:00:21.866
Ah but this time

10
00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.533
It's not that easy for us to forgive you, is it?

11
00:00:24.533 --> 00:00:26.533
Miss Jiang, I think you seem to have misunderstood.

12
00:00:26.533 --> 00:00:27.566
I'm telling you to stop

13
00:00:27.566 --> 00:00:28.966
Just to pay you back

14
00:00:29.366 --> 00:00:30.200
What do you mean?

15
00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.066
We don't have any relationship anymore

16
00:00:32.066 --> 00:00:35.133
Yesterday your housekeeper Jiang sent my mother to the hospital

17
00:00:35.133 --> 00:00:37.600
Helped him pay 50,000 dollars in medical bills

18
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.300
Now I'll give you this money back.

19
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.500
From now on, we don't owe each other

20
00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:43.700
It doesn't matter anymore

21
00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:45.366
I hope you don't come to me again in the future

22
00:00:45.366 --> 00:00:47.066
So as not to disturb my mother's recovery.

23
00:00:47.533 --> 00:00:48.333
you

24
00:00:48.933 --> 00:00:50.200
You wait for me.
