1
00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:01.333
This is my announcement.

2
00:00:01.333 --> 00:00:03.366
The chairperson runs his business abroad all year round

3
00:00:03.366 --> 00:00:04.866
After 20 years of hard work

4
00:00:04.866 --> 00:00:06.133
Finally put Huatai Group

5
00:00:06.133 --> 00:00:08.500
To the throne of the world's first market capitalization

6
00:00:08.533 --> 00:00:10.133
Now the chairperson is old

7
00:00:10.133 --> 00:00:12.566
And a suitable successor has been found

8
00:00:12.566 --> 00:00:14.100
At today's dinner party

9
00:00:14.133 --> 00:00:16.900
The chairperson will announce his successor

10
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:19.066
I heard that the chairperson of Huacan Group

11
00:00:19.066 --> 00:00:20.466
It is notoriously ruthless abroad

12
00:00:20.466 --> 00:00:22.333
Right? Anyone who messes with him?

13
00:00:22.333 --> 00:00:23.533
Guns become vegetative

14
00:00:23.533 --> 00:00:24.833
Or you'll die.

15
00:00:24.966 --> 00:00:27.033
No way, it's not cruel enough.

16
00:00:27.066 --> 00:00:28.500
Can't become the richest man in the world

17
00:00:28.566 --> 00:00:30.766
The chairperson of Huacan Group will be here soon.

18
00:00:30.766 --> 00:00:32.366
You two impersonate him

19
00:00:32.366 --> 00:00:33.500
If you don't run again

20
00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.066
I'm afraid it's a dead end

21
00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.066
Oh, sister, the two of them will be dead soon.

22
00:00:39.066 --> 00:00:40.133
Why do you speak for them?

23
00:00:40.133 --> 00:00:41.133
Who dies and who lives

24
00:00:41.133 --> 00:00:43.566
Don't forget you until the last moment

25
00:00:43.733 --> 00:00:43.866
that

26
00:00:43.866 --> 00:00:46.733
I hope that when the chairperson of Huacan Group comes later

27
00:00:46.733 --> 00:00:48.633
Your mouth can still be that hard

28
00:00:48.666 --> 00:00:51.100
Now the chairperson has arrived at the scene

29
00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:53.766
Let's give a round of applause to the chairperson and heirs

30
00:00:53.766 --> 00:00:54.666
take the stage
