1
00:00:01.933 --> 00:00:03.300
Don't bother me about the Jiang family again

2
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.200
The Jiang family is Dad's lifelong hard work

3
00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.300
You have the heart to watch him be destroyed

4
00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:08.566
You don't have to be strong

5
00:00:08.733 --> 00:00:10.166
Even if it's not for the Jiang family

6
00:00:10.166 --> 00:00:11.266
Your adoptive mother is hospitalized

7
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.100
Although there is Dean Wang's treatment

8
00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:14.133
The subsequent medical expenses

9
00:00:14.133 --> 00:00:15.700
That's a lot of money.

10
00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:16.600
Take the money

11
00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:18.200
Not only will it cure your adoptive mother's disease

12
00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.600
It can also ensure that you will have no worries about food and clothing for the rest of your life

13
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:23.066
If it was before breaking off the relationship

14
00:00:23.066 --> 00:00:24.366
You brought me 2 million

15
00:00:24.366 --> 00:00:26.033
Maybe I'll be grateful to you

16
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:28.000
And now we have nothing to do with each other.

17
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.666
I don't have to worry about you for the rest of my life

18
00:00:30.666 --> 00:00:32.466
Dad actually cared about you before

19
00:00:32.466 --> 00:00:34.366
You obviously cared so much about Dad before

20
00:00:34.366 --> 00:00:35.933
Are you really dying?

21
00:00:35.933 --> 00:00:36.900
An unwarm heart

22
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:37.966
I don't want to cover anymore

23
00:00:37.966 --> 00:00:38.966
If he really cared

24
00:00:38.966 --> 00:00:40.600
Why have you still treated me for so many years?

25
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:41.633
regardless

26
00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.233
Why are you cutting ties with me in public again?

27
00:00:44.966 --> 00:00:47.300
I haven't even recorded a face to face yet

28
00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.166
Just for you to come here and persuade me

29
00:00:49.466 --> 00:00:50.766
But it doesn't matter.

30
00:00:50.766 --> 00:00:52.633
There is no relationship between us

31
00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.600
I don't care if you can stop being so willful

32
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.133
I just want you to go to Huacang Group to explain.

33
00:00:58.133 --> 00:00:59.600
It's not killing you.
