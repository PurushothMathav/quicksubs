00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.166
Stop! Stop

2
00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:06.133
I thought you had done something wrong.

3
00:00:06.133 --> 00:00:08.066
The turtle just shrunk its head and dared not come out

4
00:00:08.066 --> 00:00:10.066
What happened to Xiao Can?

5
00:00:10.066 --> 00:00:11.466
I didn't hurt anyone.

6
00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.400
On the contrary, Liu Ru's mother and son framed me in order to steal it all

7
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:15.566
And it almost got me killed

8
00:00:15.566 --> 00:00:18.200
Chen Huachan, in order to invite empty

9
00:00:18.333 --> 00:00:20.266
You dare to say anything big

10
00:00:20.266 --> 00:00:22.433
At the age of 5, I obviously donated it to my father

11
00:00:22.666 --> 00:00:23.900
Nonsense

12
00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:25.300
The little fox never lies

13
00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:26.700
He saved dad for you

14
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:28.300
You don't know how to be grateful

15
00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:29.733
You still try to steal the credit

16
00:00:29.733 --> 00:00:31.233
It's hopeless

17
00:00:31.333 --> 00:00:32.400
So sad

18
00:00:32.733 --> 00:00:34.966
Xiao Can, I know you blame

19
00:00:34.966 --> 00:00:37.200
Your dad has ignored you all these years

20
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.766
Make you suffer a lot

21
00:00:38.766 --> 00:00:40.700
That's why you want to get revenge on him

22
00:00:41.066 --> 00:00:43.366
But he is also afraid that you will know that you are a rich second generation

23
00:00:43.366 --> 00:00:44.466
Just splurge

24
00:00:44.466 --> 00:00:46.666
I want to train you to become a talent early

25
00:00:46.666 --> 00:00:48.266
How can you be ungrateful?

26
00:00:48.266 --> 00:00:49.766
And almost got him killed

27
00:00:49.766 --> 00:00:51.866
Your hypocrisy makes me sick.

28
00:00:51.866 --> 00:00:54.400
I never blamed my father for kicking me out of the Jiang family

29
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:55.900
Even less likely to harm him

30
00:00:56.166 --> 00:00:58.366
And don't listen to their mother and son side

31
00:00:58.366 --> 00:00:59.933
The Son of God is here to make good people

32
00:00:59.933 --> 00:01:02.233
Judge me on the moral high ground
