00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.133
It's Mr. Lu, what are they talking about?

2
00:00:02.133 --> 00:00:04.600
Can't let that kid drip back to Jiangjiang, hurry up

3
00:00:05.333 --> 00:00:06.500
Mr. Lu

4
00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:07.733
Thank you for your busy schedule

5
00:00:07.733 --> 00:00:09.200
Come to my brother's birthday party

6
00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.166
Mr. Lu, can you come to my birthday party?

7
00:00:11.166 --> 00:00:12.666
It's really shining.

8
00:00:12.666 --> 00:00:15.000
Brother, isn't your brother him?

9
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:17.200
That person was indeed my brother before

10
00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.800
But he steals and he forces his elders

11
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.600
We have cut ties with him

12
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:22.766
Is that right?

13
00:00:22.766 --> 00:00:24.366
We have cut ties with him

14
00:00:24.366 --> 00:00:25.333
If Mr. Lu

15
00:00:25.333 --> 00:00:27.366
What negative news have you heard about him?

16
00:00:27.366 --> 00:00:29.100
It has nothing to do with our Jiang family

17
00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:31.366
A person whose biological son said he would abandon it

18
00:00:31.366 --> 00:00:32.733
I find it hard to trust responsibility.

19
00:00:32.733 --> 00:00:33.966
Projects of Huacan Group

20
00:00:33.966 --> 00:00:36.366
The void contract just signed

21
00:00:36.766 --> 00:00:38.600
Mr. Slave, don't be kidding!

22
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:39.466
We were just inside.

23
00:00:39.466 --> 00:00:41.333
Just signed the contract in front of everyone

24
00:00:41.333 --> 00:00:42.966
If you say it is invalid now, it will be invalid.

25
00:00:42.966 --> 00:00:44.600
What will those people think of us?

26
00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:45.800
Our Jiang family is in Ping Town

27
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.366
But there's no place to stand

28
00:00:47.366 --> 00:00:49.200
You... you can't do this to us!

29
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.766
That's your Jiang family's business.

30
00:00:50.766 --> 00:00:52.033
Take care of yourself

31
00:00:53.066 --> 00:00:54.533
Hey, Mr. Lu, Mr. Lu

32
00:00:54.533 --> 00:00:57.400
Lu Oops, Mr. Lu was fine just now

33
00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.333
Why did you suddenly cancel the cooperation?

34
00:00:59.333 --> 00:01:01.466
It must be because of that trash deliberately taking revenge on me

35
00:01:01.466 --> 00:01:02.933
Deliberately speak ill of us to Mr. Lu

36
00:01:02.933 --> 00:01:04.933
Mixed the cooperation between Jiang Zi and Huacan Group

37
00:01:04.933 --> 00:01:06.733
That's for sure. What about Dad?

38
00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:08.266
Without the cooperation of Huacan Group

39
00:01:08.266 --> 00:01:09.666
Our Jiang family is finished

40
00:01:09.666 --> 00:01:10.766
Then shut up

41
00:01:11.333 --> 00:01:12.966
You two go find that rebel

42
00:01:12.966 --> 00:01:15.466
I will bring him back to meet me
