00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.066
I've made it very clear to you.

2
00:00:02.066 --> 00:00:04.166
You still want to kill the Jiang family

3
00:00:04.166 --> 00:00:05.466
You are so hopeless

4
00:00:05.466 --> 00:00:06.066
That is.

5
00:00:06.066 --> 00:00:07.766
A villain like you who only plays tricks behind his back

6
00:00:07.766 --> 00:00:08.566
It's disgusting.

7
00:00:08.566 --> 00:00:10.166
Now you are begging me

8
00:00:10.166 --> 00:00:11.766
That's how you ask for help.

9
00:00:11.966 --> 00:00:13.366
Don't worry.

10
00:00:13.366 --> 00:00:16.600
If you want me to go back to Jiangjiang, it's not impossible

11
00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.033
You just need to put Jiangning

12
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:19.900
Just go out

13
00:00:20.166 --> 00:00:22.166
Your fox tail is finally revealed

14
00:00:22.166 --> 00:00:23.500
It's just that you can't tolerate raccoons

15
00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:24.766
I want to kick him out of the Jiang family

16
00:00:24.766 --> 00:00:26.366
Hello, you eat the family property alone

17
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.866
I have some money for your Jiang family

18
00:00:27.866 --> 00:00:28.933
Not interested at all

19
00:00:28.933 --> 00:00:30.933
I'm just trying to get justice for myself

20
00:00:30.933 --> 00:00:32.766
If you want me to go back to the Jiang family

21
00:00:32.966 --> 00:00:34.400
Only this one condition

22
00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.000
I might be able to promise something else.

23
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.066
But this can't be done.

24
00:00:38.733 --> 00:00:39.800
That being the case

25
00:00:39.966 --> 00:00:40.966
Then I have nothing to say.

26
00:00:40.966 --> 00:00:42.433
We are grasshoppers in the same boat

27
00:00:42.566 --> 00:00:43.700
This will be resurrected

28
00:00:43.766 --> 00:00:45.200
We can have a bite to eat

29
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.800
You might even get a mouthful of soup

30
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:47.866
It will be difficult

31
00:00:47.866 --> 00:00:50.233
You definitely don't want to regret it. You are threatening me.

32
00:00:50.266 --> 00:00:51.066
Let's just say so.

33
00:00:51.066 --> 00:00:52.600
Don't think I don't know

34
00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.733
You are challenging our bottom line.

35
00:00:54.733 --> 00:00:56.933
Pretending to get our attention

36
00:00:56.933 --> 00:00:59.000
In the end, you have to go to Jiang Jiang obediently

37
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.466
Accept our alms?

38
00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:01.733
You're tired too

39
00:01:01.733 --> 00:01:02.600
Pack and pack

40
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.666
Why don't you come back with us directly?

41
00:01:04.766 --> 00:01:05.833
If you think so

42
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.466
Then I can't help it.
