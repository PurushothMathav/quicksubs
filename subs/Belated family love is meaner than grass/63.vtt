00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:01.566
It sounds like the truth.

2
00:00:01.566 --> 00:00:02.966
My good grandfather

3
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.200
I see you.

4
00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.666
Could it be that I can't get along abroad?

5
00:00:06.666 --> 00:00:08.066
After returning to China

6
00:00:08.066 --> 00:00:10.000
I want to find someone to retire with you, right?

7
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.966
Hey, you need to find someone to retire with you.

8
00:00:11.966 --> 00:00:13.966
You have to find powerful people like us

9
00:00:13.966 --> 00:00:15.333
You are looking for such a trash like him.

10
00:00:15.333 --> 00:00:17.166
How could you starve to death? You are defiant

11
00:00:17.166 --> 00:00:18.366
Powerless to grandpa again and again

12
00:00:18.366 --> 00:00:19.500
Get out now

13
00:00:20.266 --> 00:00:21.366
Why did you tell me to get out?

14
00:00:21.366 --> 00:00:21.866
Who are you?

15
00:00:21.866 --> 00:00:24.266
If you want to get out, you should get out.

16
00:00:24.366 --> 00:00:27.200
No, you should be impersonated as the chairperson.

17
00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.100
And you, pretending to be the heir, will be arrested

18
00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:30.833
Make way for him to punish you

19
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.566
If you pass by, you can ask Lu Selfish.

20
00:00:36.566 --> 00:00:38.466
Does he dare to arrest me?

21
00:00:38.466 --> 00:00:40.900
Ouch, you're really pretending to be more and more like it.

22
00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:43.533
Then the two of you will not be a real dragon

23
00:00:43.533 --> 00:00:46.500
I will hand you over to Huachang Group in a while.

24
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.366
Just enough to take credit for Mr. Lu

25
00:00:48.666 --> 00:00:50.700
The second sister is right

26
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.266
We should arrest these two people

27
00:00:53.266 --> 00:00:54.466
Then hand it over to Mr. Lu

28
00:00:54.466 --> 00:00:56.000
Let him see our center

29
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.400
I can't see your center.

30
00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:58.866
But your wishful thinking

31
00:00:58.866 --> 00:01:00.200
I can see clearly
