00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:01.866
I'm just talking about things

2
00:00:01.866 --> 00:00:04.366
I didn't think of kicking you out of the house.

3
00:00:04.366 --> 00:00:06.233
Then I will also give a solution.

4
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:07.400
Just apologize

5
00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.300
Even if you kowtow and apologize, we will recognize it.

6
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:10.333
What else do you want?

7
00:00:10.333 --> 00:00:12.500
Let Grandpa kick Xiaoli out of the house too?

8
00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:13.466
Shut up!

9
00:00:13.533 --> 00:00:15.166
Xiaoli is my most beloved son

10
00:00:15.166 --> 00:00:16.933
He is also the future heir of the Jiang family

11
00:00:16.933 --> 00:00:18.100
This thing

12
00:00:18.566 --> 00:00:19.633
So far.

13
00:00:19.733 --> 00:00:21.466
This is the end of the matter.

14
00:00:21.466 --> 00:00:22.700
What about the bone marrow?

15
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.066
It's not the eldest sister, what do you mean?

16
00:00:25.066 --> 00:00:27.266
Could it be that you suspect that the bone marrow was not donated by me?

17
00:00:27.333 --> 00:00:28.866
Xiao Cai didn't steal anything

18
00:00:28.866 --> 00:00:30.366
Instead, you framed him

19
00:00:30.366 --> 00:00:31.800
It's your character that's at fault

20
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.833
So the bone marrow thing I have reason to believe

21
00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:36.766
It was Xiao Cai who donated the bone marrow

22
00:00:36.766 --> 00:00:37.833
And you

23
00:00:38.933 --> 00:00:39.900
You are lying!

24
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.666
Dad's attending doctor, Dr. Zhao, has already testified

25
00:00:42.666 --> 00:00:43.966
I donated the bone marrow

26
00:00:43.966 --> 00:00:45.500
Are you still holding on to it?

27
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:46.900
Don't you know?

28
00:00:47.266 --> 00:00:49.133
Dr. Zhao was arrested for social reasons

29
00:00:49.133 --> 00:00:51.333
Obviously it was because he received someone else's red envelope.

30
00:00:51.333 --> 00:00:52.600
cheat for others

31
00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.866
You are siblings

32
00:00:54.866 --> 00:00:57.866
You have to pay attention to evidence when you talk to him, right?

33
00:00:57.866 --> 00:00:59.933
Which eye did you see that I gave the red envelope?

34
00:00:59.933 --> 00:01:01.100
I didn't say you.

35
00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:02.466
What are you so excited about?
