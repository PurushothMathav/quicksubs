00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:03.766
The king heard that the general woke up

2
00:00:03.766 --> 00:00:05.166
Came to visit

3
00:00:05.166 --> 00:00:06.966
But never thought

4
00:00:06.966 --> 00:00:10.733
I actually saw the second lady of your mansion cover the sky with one hand

5
00:00:10.733 --> 00:00:13.533
I'm just worried about my lord

6
00:00:13.533 --> 00:00:16.933
Jiang Wanyue and the Crown Prince's divorce was the emperor's decree

7
00:00:16.933 --> 00:00:18.600
The second lady said so

8
00:00:18.866 --> 00:00:20.266
Do you have any comments?

9
00:00:20.466 --> 00:00:22.466
Minister dare not minister

10
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.133
Someone is crying

11
00:00:27.133 --> 00:00:28.666
Will everything be okay?

12
00:00:41.466 --> 00:00:43.600
What Rong'er said yesterday is indeed right

13
00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.800
Jiang Wanyue is a feisty sword

14
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.866
Father, in your absence

15
00:00:49.866 --> 00:00:51.833
My sister learned some side ways

16
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.833
He hurt the butler and messed up my face

17
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.500
Also provoked the prince

18
00:00:56.566 --> 00:00:57.966
Then listen to me

19
00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.566
Oh, my God.

20
00:00:58.566 --> 00:00:59.566
You dead girl

21
00:00:59.566 --> 00:01:01.400
So presumptuous before you pay

22
00:01:02.533 --> 00:01:05.066
Ah let it go let it go

23
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.300
Wan'er Ayue

24
00:01:08.766 --> 00:01:12.633
Is what your aunt and sister said true?
