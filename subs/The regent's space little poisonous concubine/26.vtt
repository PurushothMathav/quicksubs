00:00:00.466 --> 00:00:01.400
His Royal Highness

2
00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:03.500
You'd better take care of your princess

3
00:00:03.666 --> 00:00:06.000
He's the man you want to marry

4
00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:11.100
My poem has the apology of the second lady

5
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:15.766
I, my second wife, I don't want to resist, do I?

6
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:16.633
Wan Yue

7
00:00:17.166 --> 00:00:18.200
brilliant

8
00:00:18.533 --> 00:00:19.333
But

9
00:00:19.733 --> 00:00:23.633
What happened today is indeed what Second Madam Jiang did wrong.

10
00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:27.066
But after all, today is a lonely wedding day

11
00:00:28.333 --> 00:00:29.766
Another day another day

12
00:00:29.766 --> 00:00:31.366
Lonely night

13
00:00:31.366 --> 00:00:33.600
Please apologize to you.

14
00:00:34.066 --> 00:00:35.600
How about poetry?

15
00:00:35.666 --> 00:00:36.600
Your Highness

16
00:00:37.133 --> 00:00:39.633
Soldiers are untrustworthy and disadvantageous

17
00:00:39.733 --> 00:00:42.500
Are you going to go back on your word in front of me?

18
00:00:42.766 --> 00:00:44.800
No minister father dare not

19
00:00:48.133 --> 00:00:49.000
Wan Yue

20
00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:51.166
It was my aunt who was wrong

21
00:00:51.466 --> 00:00:53.266
Auntie apologizes to you

22
00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.600
Cure the emperor's poison

23
00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.266
Is this Miss Jiang?

24
00:01:00.266 --> 00:01:02.400
It seems that he is not only excellent in medicine

25
00:01:02.733 --> 00:01:05.100
And he's really good at poetry.

26
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.433
It was just luck that he saved me

27
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.900
Not a real skill

28
00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.566
I never believe in luck

29
00:01:19.366 --> 00:01:21.966
Jiang Wanyue, don't be complacent

30
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.433
I'll embarrass you later

31
00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:30.666
Not good, Mr. Li set off for the market town and fell to the ground
