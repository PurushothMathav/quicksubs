00:00:00.866 --> 00:00:01.733
Lord Providence

2
00:00:01.733 --> 00:00:03.000
Even if you don't like me

3
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.733
You shouldn't joke about medicine

4
00:00:04.733 --> 00:00:06.933
This is what saves our lives

5
00:00:06.933 --> 00:00:08.766
The condition has not been diagnosed yet

6
00:00:08.766 --> 00:00:10.233
It's not good to use drugs indiscriminately

7
00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:12.400
Nonsense, I'll be fine after drinking the medicine

8
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:13.966
Explain that you are a Christian doctor

9
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.066
It is. It is.

10
00:00:16.066 --> 00:00:17.666
The doctor is uneasy

11
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:20.033
How much does it take to put that piece under his hand?

12
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.266
Lord Tianyi

13
00:00:21.366 --> 00:00:22.733
Instead of arguing with me

14
00:00:22.733 --> 00:00:24.266
Why don't you help me?

15
00:00:24.266 --> 00:00:25.966
Everyone is too busy

16
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:31.366
I said don't ask

17
00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:33.766
When is it?

18
00:00:33.766 --> 00:00:35.500
Don't argue with Dr. Fang

19
00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.166
Now people's lives are at stake

20
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.700
Can you not be unreasonable?

21
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.000
Just because people's lives are at stake

22
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.900
That's why I can't use you at will

23
00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:48.833
Ouch, I'm dying of cravings.

24
00:00:50.766 --> 00:00:51.966
Get him emetic

25
00:00:51.966 --> 00:00:54.200
Come on, I'll go

26
00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.800
Don't come and make trouble

27
00:00:57.866 --> 00:00:59.200
Who gave you the prescription?
