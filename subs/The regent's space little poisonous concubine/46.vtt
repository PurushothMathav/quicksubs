1
00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:01.566
You are a maid

2
00:00:01.666 --> 00:00:03.400
Who gave you the guts to teach me a lesson?

3
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.066
Besides, if you weren't for his Highness

4
00:00:06.066 --> 00:00:08.033
How could you not let me attend the party?

5
00:00:08.466 --> 00:00:10.466
The servant knows the mistake, the empress calms down

6
00:00:10.666 --> 00:00:12.966
It's just that the emperor has now appointed the crown princess

7
00:00:12.966 --> 00:00:14.766
Empress, you must be careful

8
00:00:14.766 --> 00:00:16.800
Xie Linglong carefully designed me

9
00:00:17.266 --> 00:00:18.866
He must not be reconciled

10
00:00:18.866 --> 00:00:20.633
Look and ask me to marry you

11
00:00:23.366 --> 00:00:25.300
You go and call Jian Linglong over

12
00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.200
Say I have a way to get what he wants

13
00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.500
What do you mean?

14
00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:35.066
I can let Miss Xie get the regent's beauty

15
00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.433
You are Jiang Wanle's sister

16
00:00:37.866 --> 00:00:39.366
Willing to help me

17
00:00:39.366 --> 00:00:41.633
Only you can marry the regent

18
00:00:41.866 --> 00:00:44.700
I can continue to be the mistress of the Eastern Palace

19
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.166
But I am already engaged to the prince

20
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.833
Did Jiang Wanyue ever have a marriage contract with the crown prince?

21
00:00:50.866 --> 00:00:51.966
And now?

22
00:00:51.966 --> 00:00:54.966
Jiang Wanyue can attract the regent to take the initiative

23
00:00:54.966 --> 00:00:56.900
It depends on his good medical skills

24
00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:58.533
Can be used by the regent

25
00:00:58.533 --> 00:01:01.833
If you can prove that you are better than Jiang Wanyue

26
00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.100
He Zengshi's palace chose you

27
00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:05.766
But I never found anyone

28
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.433
You just need to find someone to play a role

29
00:01:08.533 --> 00:01:10.766
Let Jiang Wanjun's reputation be discredited

30
00:01:10.766 --> 00:01:13.166
Lure the regent to seek you instead

31
00:01:13.166 --> 00:01:14.800
When you enter the palace

32
00:01:15.133 --> 00:01:18.066
Can he still divorce you?

33
00:01:18.733 --> 00:01:21.000
Okay, let's do it.

34
00:01:24.066 --> 00:01:24.933
Miss is not good

35
00:01:24.933 --> 00:01:26.400
Someone broke into the rivers and lakes and refused to leave

36
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.600
Then I just want to see you
