00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.033
Why are you here?

2
00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:07.766
Brother, what are you doing?

3
00:00:08.166 --> 00:00:11.700
What am I doing for you to enter the palace late at night?

4
00:00:11.733 --> 00:00:13.366
Are you going to rebel?

5
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.166
The emperor first used the people to serve poison

6
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:17.500
Use the prince to refine alchemy

7
00:00:17.766 --> 00:00:19.766
Where did the face ask us why we entered the palace?

8
00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.766
I want someone

9
00:00:26.266 --> 00:00:27.833
Tell them both to arrest

10
00:00:28.466 --> 00:00:29.566
Where is the guard

11
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.566
I'd rather live than have slaves eat them all

12
00:00:33.566 --> 00:00:35.966
If you do more injustice, you will die

13
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.200
What do you want?

14
00:00:39.333 --> 00:00:40.400
Are you going to kill me?

15
00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.366
No you can't kill me

16
00:00:42.366 --> 00:00:43.566
I am the emperor

17
00:00:43.666 --> 00:00:45.400
The late emperor once decreed

18
00:00:45.533 --> 00:00:47.166
If the emperor is not evil

19
00:00:47.266 --> 00:00:49.033
I can replace it

20
00:00:49.133 --> 00:00:50.966
No wonder you can't pretend to be a woman

21
00:00:50.966 --> 00:00:52.366
You are pretending

22
00:00:52.766 --> 00:00:56.833
That's right, I can't bear my colleague Cao Ge to bear it again and again

23
00:00:56.966 --> 00:00:58.200
So far

24
00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.633
I don't want to see you harming Dongli anymore

25
00:01:10.533 --> 00:01:12.266
Come here or I'll kill him

26
00:01:12.266 --> 00:01:13.566
Kill if you want

27
00:01:13.566 --> 00:01:14.833
Let go of poison
