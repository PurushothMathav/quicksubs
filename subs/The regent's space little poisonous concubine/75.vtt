00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.966
Let's go up the mountain to marry our king

2
00:00:03.166 --> 00:00:06.400
Don't worry, our king is young, handsome and literate

3
00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:07.566
You will never suffer

4
00:00:07.566 --> 00:00:09.066
Strange two people

5
00:00:09.066 --> 00:00:10.900
But I can use space to get out

6
00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:13.766
Why don't you go and see what they want to do?

7
00:00:14.366 --> 00:00:17.000
It's over, I haven't found it yet, I haven't found it yet.

8
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.466
Your Highness, please rest for a while

9
00:00:23.466 --> 00:00:24.766
If you don't sleep anymore

10
00:00:24.766 --> 00:00:27.500
Miss Jiang didn't find you, so you can't hold on anymore

11
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.533
Brother Yanshan is right

12
00:00:29.533 --> 00:00:32.200
No matter how busy you are, you can't skip meals or rest

13
00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:33.333
Thank you

14
00:00:33.333 --> 00:00:34.500
You are recovering from a serious illness

15
00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.400
I didn't have a good rest when I came to the palace

16
00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:37.800
Don't be too tired

17
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.100
Just leave these things to the servants

18
00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:41.800
It's okay, I'm not tired.

19
00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.100
And the doctor said

20
00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.166
Being cooped up in my room all day is not good for my health either

21
00:00:45.166 --> 00:00:46.533
Brother is looking for someone

22
00:00:46.533 --> 00:00:47.800
I might be able to help

23
00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:48.966
You go down and rest first

24
00:00:48.966 --> 00:00:50.333
I'll be free another day.

25
00:00:50.333 --> 00:00:52.033
Take you to the nearby benefits

26
00:00:56.333 --> 00:00:57.400
Where is it?

27
00:00:59.100 --> 00:00:59.600
Stay up late by me

28
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.833
We found the real thing in the suburbs
