00:00:00.566 --> 00:00:01.666
Up here?

2
00:00:02.133 --> 00:00:05.300
It's about the incomplete recipe for the elixir of immortality

3
00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:08.766
Test drugs with mercury

4
00:00:09.266 --> 00:00:10.600
whimsical

5
00:00:11.066 --> 00:00:12.300
Never mind immortality.

6
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.166
It would be nice not to eat yourself to death

7
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.300
The emperor will not believe it, so he is here to catch people to test medicine

8
00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:21.100
Just made mercury poison such a by-product

9
00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:22.400
Eight or nine are inseparable

10
00:00:23.266 --> 00:00:24.700
You fool

11
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.566
Pregnant look at this

12
00:00:33.933 --> 00:00:35.266
flesh and blood

13
00:00:35.666 --> 00:00:37.200
This is crazy.

14
00:00:37.866 --> 00:00:39.966
A person who can refine the elixir of immortality

15
00:00:39.966 --> 00:00:41.366
It's not normal

16
00:00:41.366 --> 00:00:44.433
The writing on this piece of paper is not like the others

17
00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.700
That's two people.

18
00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.133
Now the other one is to go out and kidnap people

19
00:00:50.133 --> 00:00:51.700
Or marched and was ordered to go

20
00:00:51.866 --> 00:00:53.433
The person who wants it is unyielding

21
00:00:53.733 --> 00:00:55.200
It must be an attack

22
00:00:55.333 --> 00:00:57.366
In case the emperor believes that prescription

23
00:00:57.366 --> 00:00:58.833
We have to get back.

24
00:00:58.866 --> 00:01:00.366
I'm afraid there are variables in Beijing
