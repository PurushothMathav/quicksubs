grandma

5
00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.200
Shenyang, please save grandma

6
00:00:18.533 --> 00:00:21.066
Ah! What are you doing?

7
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.766
I paid 500,000 for you

8
00:00:23.766 --> 00:00:25.566
If you dare to smash it into my hands

9
00:00:25.566 --> 00:00:26.700
What do you mean?

10
00:00:26.933 --> 00:00:30.233
Is your grandma's life no better than this broken unicorn?

11
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.300
Uh-huh.

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.400
My sister-in-law, grandma

13
00:00:36.933 --> 00:00:38.866
Grandma, are you alright?

14
00:00:42.066 --> 00:00:43.466
You give me an explanation

15
00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:45.833
Grandma has no grandson, grandma

16
00:00:46.366 --> 00:00:47.366
It must be something

17
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.600
He doesn't know how to drink water at all

18
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.100
He must be watching grandma, you're not feeling well

19
00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:54.166
Deliberately replenish dirty water for grandson

20
00:00:54.166 --> 00:00:56.833
Grandma Dopey too

21
00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.900
Grandma, but it's annoying

22
00:01:00.666 --> 00:01:03.366
He also smashed the monthly salary of that comb.

23
00:01:03.933 --> 00:01:06.566
That's what my grandson bought 500,000

24
00:01:06.766 --> 00:01:09.200
What 500,000?

25
00:01:09.366 --> 00:01:11.366
I can't believe you smashed it!

26
00:01:11.733 --> 00:01:12.700
You trash

27
00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.400
Since you smashed it, you will pay me

28
00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:18.166
Grandma, Mrs. Christmas just saved your life
