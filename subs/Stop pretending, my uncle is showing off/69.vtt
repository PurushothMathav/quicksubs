1
00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.666
What's the matter, Mr. Wu?

2
00:00:01.666 --> 00:00:04.000
The Food and Drug Administration and the Health Bureau suddenly came to check the factory

3
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.700
If some of our places are checked

4
00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.800
There's bound to be a big problem, you deal with it first

5
00:00:07.933 --> 00:00:09.100
I'll figure it out.

6
00:00:14.133 --> 00:00:15.300
Something big happened to Mr. Wu

7
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:16.533
The bank just called

8
00:00:16.533 --> 00:00:17.333
comprehensive replacement

9
00:00:17.333 --> 00:00:19.800
We don't have a penny on our books now.

10
00:00:28.333 --> 00:00:30.966
Wu General Market sold off our stock in large quantities

11
00:00:30.966 --> 00:00:33.200
Now our share price has fallen by the limit

12
00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:36.966
Director, go and see

13
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.033
Who the hell are you?

14
00:00:41.333 --> 00:00:42.500
Who Am I?

15
00:00:43.766 --> 00:00:45.766
How did you beat my wife earlier?

16
00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.666
How can I get my wife back?

17
00:00:48.666 --> 00:00:50.266
Don't deceive too much

18
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:51.966
You go too far.

19
00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.800
This sentence should be what I said

20
00:00:54.866 --> 00:00:56.766
Since you are shameless

21
00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:58.866
Don't blame me

22
00:01:02.933 --> 00:01:03.766
Mr. Wu

23
00:01:03.766 --> 00:01:06.366
The last scene of being beaten up in the toilet

24
00:01:06.366 --> 00:01:08.200
Posted online by the whole network

25
00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.533
Is the public opinion against us now?

26
00:01:10.533 --> 00:01:11.333
you

27
00:01:12.066 --> 00:01:15.600
Admit my mistake and make my wife pay it back tenfold

28
00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.400
I can let you go
