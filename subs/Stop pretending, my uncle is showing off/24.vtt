00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:02.600
Husband, why did you chase me for so long?

2
00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:04.333
It's okay. It's okay.

3
00:00:04.333 --> 00:00:06.500
The fireworks are starting, let's go

4
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.800
Everyone eat and drink, have fun and have fun

5
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:22.266
Hey husband

6
00:00:22.366 --> 00:00:24.833
It was Miss Shen who helped me save you just now.

7
00:00:24.866 --> 00:00:27.066
Shall we go over and have a drink with him?

8
00:00:27.066 --> 00:00:27.866
No.

9
00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.000
He'll be right back.

10
00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:35.433
Tomorrow, take out the gift.

11
00:00:36.566 --> 00:00:38.533
See you soon, Miss Shen

12
00:00:38.533 --> 00:00:40.066
You give me spirituality

13
00:00:40.133 --> 00:00:42.566
Can you climb the big tree of the Shen family?

14
00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.866
It depends on your performance today.

15
00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:47.200
Grandma, don't worry.

16
00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.633
You won't be disappointed, hahaha.

17
00:00:50.166 --> 00:00:50.933
grandma

18
00:00:50.933 --> 00:00:53.600
You took out all the neighborhood heirlooms

19
00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.466
Grandma takes out this thing, Miss Shen will definitely like it

20
00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:58.833
The neighbor is singing

21
00:00:59.266 --> 00:01:01.966
Just around the corner hahaha

22
00:01:02.733 --> 00:01:03.633
waste

23
00:01:04.533 --> 00:01:05.866
Why are you laughing?

24
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.233
I laugh at your ignorance

25
00:01:09.466 --> 00:01:10.300
grandma

26
00:01:11.166 --> 00:01:13.833
You'd better put this away quickly

27
00:01:14.266 --> 00:01:17.100
Shen Han said he didn't like it

28
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:17.966
Really?

29
00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.833
You mean you have a better gift than grandma?
