00:00:01.533 --> 00:00:04.666
You try. You know who I am.

2
00:00:04.733 --> 00:00:06.700
I am the eldest young master of the Wu Group

3
00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:09.366
Wu Pharmaceutical is awesome

4
00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:11.966
Hit me hard

5
00:00:12.966 --> 00:00:14.200
What are you doing?

6
00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:15.300
Don't fight, don't fight

7
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:18.200
Don't hit me with money

8
00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.166
You deserve to talk to me about money

9
00:00:20.866 --> 00:00:24.166
Warn those you shouldn't offend, don't offend

10
00:00:25.666 --> 00:00:27.600
Find a trash can and throw it in

11
00:00:28.266 --> 00:00:30.500
No, no, I was wrong, I was wrong.

12
00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:33.900
Xiaolang

13
00:00:34.166 --> 00:00:35.766
We should go home.

14
00:00:35.866 --> 00:00:37.566
Before things are found out

15
00:00:37.566 --> 00:00:40.000
I'm definitely not going back, ma'am

16
00:00:40.333 --> 00:00:41.966
This is what grandpa meant.

17
00:00:41.966 --> 00:00:43.366
Don't mention him to me

18
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.433
Grandpa Xiaolang has a difficult sister

19
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:48.666
I'm going.

20
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:50.600
OK

21
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.633
I will stay with my colleagues for a while

22
00:00:53.933 --> 00:00:56.400
If you have any trouble, come to you directly.

23
00:00:58.066 --> 00:00:59.400
I'll go first

24
00:01:12.466 --> 00:01:14.833
I will definitely find you

25
00:01:16.066 --> 00:01:16.866
husband

26
00:01:18.733 --> 00:01:20.033
Are you all right?

27
00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.900
What about Wu Yongren?

28
00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:24.966
Who was that girl just now?

29
00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:26.500
Just now

30
00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.000
I told Wu Yong the story of finishing love

31
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
The pain he was touched by has gone away after a day

32
00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:33.500
That Girl?

33
00:01:34.133 --> 00:01:35.000
Just asking for directions

34
00:01:36.733 --> 00:01:39.366
Hey, that's right. Hmm.

35
00:01:39.366 --> 00:01:40.866
Family dinner at home

36
00:01:40.866 --> 00:01:42.833
Does grandma agree to let us eat?

37
00:01:42.866 --> 00:01:44.433
Is there anything I need to prepare?

38
00:01:44.666 --> 00:01:46.866
No, I'm ready.

39
00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.966
We should like it. Okay.
