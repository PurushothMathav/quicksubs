00:00:00.733 --> 00:00:01.533
Mom

2
00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:05.700
This happened back then

3
00:00:05.933 --> 00:00:07.600
I thought it was over.

4
00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:10.966
But I heard you and Crape Myrtle last night

5
00:00:11.066 --> 00:00:14.700
I know it's not over yet

6
00:00:14.966 --> 00:00:18.000
Why did Mom and Uncle Huang know my grandfather?

7
00:00:18.533 --> 00:00:21.233
Why do they all have identical tattoos?

8
00:00:21.366 --> 00:00:24.766
Your father and your uncle Huang are brothers and sisters

9
00:00:25.466 --> 00:00:29.166
As for the old man above, he is your grandfather.

10
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:31.066
I don't know.

11
00:00:31.566 --> 00:00:34.033
What happened that year?

12
00:00:34.166 --> 00:00:35.633
I don't know either.

13
00:00:35.866 --> 00:00:38.433
But there is one thing I can tell you

14
00:00:38.466 --> 00:00:40.633
Your dad and your uncle Huang

15
00:00:40.866 --> 00:00:42.900
It will never harm your parents

16
00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.500
I didn't see it with my own eyes back then

17
00:00:46.066 --> 00:00:47.000
child

18
00:00:47.333 --> 00:00:51.266
Sometimes what the eyes see may not be true

19
00:00:56.266 --> 00:00:57.833
If the truth is what mom said

20
00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.500
The death of my parents

21
00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:04.833
No, no, it won't be grandpa's tiger poison, not a child

22
00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.500
The plan can begin

23
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.466
Time to unlock

24
00:01:33.466 --> 00:01:34.666
Hello Crape Myrtle

25
00:01:34.666 --> 00:01:35.933
Go to the eastern suburbs

26
00:01:35.933 --> 00:01:38.433
I have something important to ask you
