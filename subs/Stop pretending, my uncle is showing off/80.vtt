00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:03.266
Wouldn't it be too cheap for him to kill him like this?

2
00:00:03.333 --> 00:00:06.366
Besides, you can't go to jail if he's dead.

3
00:00:06.566 --> 00:00:08.033
Give him to me.

4
00:00:08.533 --> 00:00:12.300
I will make him live in pain for the rest of his life

5
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.100
Come

6
00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.033
Take him away

7
00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.466
Tell me how you want to die

8
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:34.866
Give me a break.

9
00:00:34.866 --> 00:00:35.866
Please forgive me.

10
00:00:35.866 --> 00:00:37.900
It's all my ghosts and gods called dragons

11
00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.566
How can we say that we are all family?

12
00:00:42.133 --> 00:00:43.633
I never want to see this person again

13
00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:48.700
sister

14
00:00:49.133 --> 00:00:50.566
What happened back then?

15
00:00:53.966 --> 00:00:57.433
Parents and grandparents used to be members of the Illuminati

16
00:00:58.466 --> 00:01:00.633
But because he hated the behavior of the Illuminati

17
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:02.200
decide to quit

18
00:01:02.766 --> 00:01:04.566
But they have gold and silver in their hands

19
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.200
Killed by emotion

20
00:01:07.366 --> 00:01:09.166
Fortunately, grandpa escaped

21
00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.800
After so many years of investigation

22
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.400
Finally, I have an explanation for my parents

23
00:01:17.733 --> 00:01:19.633
Come on. Let's go to Tianjin.

24
00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.433
Music brings people

25
00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.500
The Illuminati have been killed by us

26
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.166
Yes, I did underestimate your strength

27
00:01:36.533 --> 00:01:39.000
No, why has your voice changed?

28
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.233
What about my grandfather?
