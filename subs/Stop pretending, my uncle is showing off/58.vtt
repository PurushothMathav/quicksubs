Hello bro

2
00:00:01.666 --> 00:00:04.200
What's the matter, is Mr. Shen free?

3
00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.533
I have a few brothers who would like to meet you

4
00:00:06.533 --> 00:00:09.166
Although there are some clues to the parents' words now

5
00:00:09.366 --> 00:00:12.200
But look at grandpa's attitude and Huang Renyi's attitude

6
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.033
Obviously things are not easy

7
00:00:14.366 --> 00:00:16.400
Now I can meet some people

8
00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.500
It's going to be easier to do things.

9
00:00:19.533 --> 00:00:21.433
Okay, you can send me the address.

10
00:00:31.066 --> 00:00:33.266
What do you care about after the president?

11
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:35.500
Good Chen Shao

12
00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.033
Let's have another drink

13
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.366
Mr. Chen

14
00:00:49.866 --> 00:00:51.800
Ouch third brother

15
00:00:51.866 --> 00:00:53.300
Long time no see

16
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:54.833
Hahaha oh

17
00:00:55.266 --> 00:00:59.166
What's the wind, I'm not promoted by you, third brother?

18
00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:01.700
I do have something to ask you today

19
00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.000
Hahaha, our relationship

20
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.733
Is it a little too close to say trouble?

21
00:01:05.733 --> 00:01:07.000
What's the matter?

22
00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.033
Third brother, I want to borrow a few people from you

23
00:01:10.066 --> 00:01:11.633
Want a few reliable ladies

24
00:01:12.066 --> 00:01:14.500
I'll thank you when I'm done

25
00:01:14.566 --> 00:01:17.100
Hahaha, oops, grandma.

26
00:01:17.566 --> 00:01:19.700
I don't know how to make a trip for a few people

27
00:01:19.933 --> 00:01:22.400
Yes, thank you, third brother.

28
00:01:29.933 --> 00:01:30.733
Shen Lang

29
00:01:31.133 --> 00:01:33.200
I'm going to kill you this time.
