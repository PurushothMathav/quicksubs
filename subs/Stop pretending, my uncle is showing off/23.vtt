1
00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.233
husband

2
00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:03.233
Are you okay?

3
00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:05.400
Crape myrtle, who is your husband?

4
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:06.900
How could anything happen?

5
00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:08.966
It's you, wait for me.

6
00:00:08.966 --> 00:00:09.900
I'm going to the toilet

7
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.100
I'll be back in a while

8
00:00:28.966 --> 00:00:29.900
Someone

9
00:00:32.766 --> 00:00:33.566
Crazy

10
00:00:33.566 --> 00:00:35.700
They all said that there are people in it, do they still have any quality?

11
00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.300
I'm welcome to knock again. What the hell?

12
00:00:42.066 --> 00:00:44.066
Mom, do you know who I am?

13
00:00:47.066 --> 00:00:48.766
Wu Yong

14
00:00:51.766 --> 00:00:52.500
Fight me

15
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.933
Is it you? Did I find someone to kill you?

16
00:00:54.933 --> 00:00:56.866
Dare to hit me my idea

17
00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.900
This is my last chance.

18
00:00:59.966 --> 00:01:01.766
If you want to trouble me

19
00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:03.266
Anytime welcome.

20
00:01:03.933 --> 00:01:05.866
But if there is a next time

21
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.566
I'll put your head in the pit

22
00:01:09.066 --> 00:01:10.066
Let you be well

23
00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:12.400
chores

24
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.700
When the hell are you getting some air?

25
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.066
You are not a man

26
00:01:16.066 --> 00:01:17.966
Am I a man?

27
00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:19.600
You are not qualified to comment

28
00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:25.000
Take a picture for you.

29
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.100
You have to dare to be third-rate ten again

30
00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.200
Why wait for the news?

31
00:01:30.533 --> 00:01:31.166
You nonsense

32
00:01:31.166 --> 00:01:31.966
You wait for me.
