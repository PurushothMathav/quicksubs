00:00:02.733 --> 00:00:05.600
I didn't expect my father and brother to be in the same way

2
00:00:05.733 --> 00:00:09.066
So I don't have to hide anymore.

3
00:00:10.366 --> 00:00:11.433
I slept on the floor.

4
00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:13.433
Fight with me

5
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.633
Wenjie is me Zhang Zeming

6
00:00:17.733 --> 00:00:19.200
You are so boring

7
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.300
Just a pair of pants for us to wear until the big friendship

8
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.300
You came to school and didn't tell me

9
00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:24.400
Open the door!

10
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.000
Oops, it's Xu Wenjin's friend

11
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.033
Once recognized

12
00:00:30.766 --> 00:00:32.533
Open the door!

13
00:00:32.533 --> 00:00:34.666
Wenjing, what are you dawdling about?

14
00:00:34.666 --> 00:00:37.200
Open the door, if you don't open the door, I'll stop by

15
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.166
What are you afraid of?

16
00:00:42.966 --> 00:00:45.266
It's over hahaha

17
00:00:45.266 --> 00:00:47.066
Sister Wen, long time no see

18
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.300
You've grown so tall

19
00:00:51.566 --> 00:00:52.966
He is Xu Wenjie

20
00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.633
Brother Zeming, long time no see

21
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:07.966
Haha, Sister Wen

22
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.266
8 years no see

23
00:01:09.266 --> 00:01:11.100
You still look like a loser

24
00:01:11.566 --> 00:01:13.266
There will be a cycling test tomorrow.

25
00:01:13.266 --> 00:01:15.200
Are you so crazy?

26
00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:16.633
Oh.

27
00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.633
It turns out that I only knew each other when I was a child.

28
00:01:20.766 --> 00:01:22.966
Worry about yourself.

29
00:01:22.966 --> 00:01:24.400
I can definitely get through

30
00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:30.233
Sister Wen, why do you seem like a different person?

31
00:01:31.933 --> 00:01:34.233
No, why do you say that?

32
00:01:34.566 --> 00:01:36.766
You used to get bored when you saw books

33
00:01:36.766 --> 00:01:38.233
Dizzy when I hear the exam

34
00:01:38.533 --> 00:01:40.766
How can you be so positive now?
