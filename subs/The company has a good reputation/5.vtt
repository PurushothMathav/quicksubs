00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:01.800
Are you sick?

2
00:00:02.733 --> 00:00:05.900
I'm fine, but I've had a cold recently.

3
00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:07.566
meaning

4
00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:10.033
Well, forget it.

5
00:00:10.366 --> 00:00:11.566
You pay more attention to your body

6
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:13.500
I have to go first

7
00:00:21.366 --> 00:00:22.433
Take the medicine

8
00:00:24.366 --> 00:00:25.666
What is this?

9
00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:27.600
Last night was just a mistake

10
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.266
You don't deserve to have my child

11
00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:34.066
What are you waiting for?

12
00:00:34.333 --> 00:00:36.233
I'm not feeling very well right now

13
00:00:36.933 --> 00:00:38.266
I want to eat it later

14
00:00:38.266 --> 00:00:39.233
Right now.

15
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:41.566
Later, you used forgetting as an excuse

16
00:00:41.733 --> 00:00:43.233
Don't make me do it myself

17
00:01:15.566 --> 00:01:17.600
Miss Xu, are you alright?

18
00:01:18.766 --> 00:01:21.566
Why are you wearing my sister's clothes?

19
00:01:23.266 --> 00:01:26.033
Really? Maybe it just so happens.

20
00:01:26.133 --> 00:01:27.366
Hanchuan gave it to me.

21
00:01:27.366 --> 00:01:28.966
He said it was perfect for me

22
00:01:29.066 --> 00:01:32.166
Miss Song Han Chuan is my husband

23
00:01:32.366 --> 00:01:34.033
I hope you don't lose your sense of proportion.

24
00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.066
Miss Xu, I mean no harm

25
00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.366
I just came to return something

26
00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.866
This is my wedding ring with Han Chuan

27
00:01:44.133 --> 00:01:45.500
Why is it with you?

28
00:01:45.866 --> 00:01:48.500
It was October 24th, my birthday.

29
00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.700
Haichuan accidentally left it at my house

30
00:01:52.166 --> 00:01:54.000
That night.

31
00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.500
It was my wedding night with Hankawa

32
00:01:57.866 --> 00:01:59.200
I'm so sorry.

33
00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:01.166
Leave you alone

34
00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.066
Hankawa and I

35
00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.233
It was a very pleasant evening
