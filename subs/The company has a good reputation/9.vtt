00:00:00.766 --> 00:00:02.500
Do you remember who I am?

2
00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:06.633
Mom

3
00:00:07.266 --> 00:00:09.400
Just remember, just remember

4
00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:12.500
You don't tell your mother when you're sick

5
00:00:13.366 --> 00:00:14.966
You know it all

6
00:00:15.966 --> 00:00:17.000
Don't worry.

7
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.300
Mom will do anything to cure you

8
00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.966
Oh, do you have a pen and paper?

9
00:00:23.966 --> 00:00:25.400
I want to write something

10
00:00:25.466 --> 00:00:27.033
Yes. Yes.

11
00:00:28.533 --> 00:00:29.333
Here you go.

12
00:00:33.333 --> 00:00:34.766
You rest first and then wash.

13
00:00:34.766 --> 00:00:36.600
Mom, go to the doctor's?

14
00:00:45.333 --> 00:00:46.400
Now.

15
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.966
Buy you or wait more

16
00:00:50.766 --> 00:00:53.433
Maybe it's giving a big couple.

17
00:01:12.366 --> 00:01:14.766
Amnesia cannot be treated surgically

18
00:01:14.766 --> 00:01:17.400
The ingredients of the special medicine are only 1%

19
00:01:18.666 --> 00:01:20.300
I have no choice.

20
00:01:21.866 --> 00:01:22.966
How could this be?

21
00:01:22.966 --> 00:01:25.300
Ah Ze, don't scare Auntie Wings

22
00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:26.633
He's so young.

23
00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.200
Auntie has lost her lips once

24
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.866
I can't lose my wings again

25
00:01:33.733 --> 00:01:36.300
Mom, don't blame Xu Ze

26
00:01:36.666 --> 00:01:38.600
He has tried his best

27
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.033
You don't have to be sad for me

28
00:01:41.733 --> 00:01:42.700
And

29
00:01:43.533 --> 00:01:44.966
Sign late for me

30
00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:47.466
Be sure to remember

31
00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.666
Hand it over to Han Chuan

32
00:01:54.266 --> 00:01:55.100
Here it is.

33
00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:56.500
What!

34
00:01:57.166 --> 00:01:58.233
his

35
00:01:59.366 --> 00:02:00.233
Freedom

36
00:02:02.266 --> 00:02:04.033
I'm so tired now.

37
00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.800
I want to sleep for a while

38
00:02:09.166 --> 00:02:11.100
Friend, don't sleep

39
00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.433
Get up and talk to dad, okay?

40
00:02:14.066 --> 00:02:14.866
bosom friend

41
00:02:15.133 --> 00:02:15.933
know
