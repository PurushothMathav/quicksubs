00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:01.866
Who says I don't like him?

2
00:00:02.766 --> 00:00:03.900
Pardon me?

3
00:00:04.266 --> 00:00:06.066
I know what decisions I should make.

4
00:00:06.066 --> 00:00:07.233
You don't need to remind me.

5
00:00:08.133 --> 00:00:09.400
I will leave you

6
00:00:09.666 --> 00:00:10.866
It would be better to protect her forever

7
00:00:10.866 --> 00:00:13.200
Otherwise I will definitely take her away

8
00:00:17.966 --> 00:00:20.700
Fortunately, Han Chuan has you by my side all the time.

9
00:00:21.366 --> 00:00:24.533
I seem to have fallen in love with Dr. Xu

10
00:00:24.533 --> 00:00:26.566
As long as I think of Cheng Hanchuan

11
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.633
It will be very uncomfortable in my heart

12
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.700
It's like I'm about to die.

13
00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:34.266
Chen Anchuan, you may not like to insist

14
00:00:34.266 --> 00:00:35.466
But you can't do that again and again.

15
00:00:35.466 --> 00:00:36.866
Hurt him again and again

16
00:00:37.366 --> 00:00:38.300
It doesn't matter.

17
00:00:38.466 --> 00:00:40.266
Anyway, I have never liked Xu Zhiyi
