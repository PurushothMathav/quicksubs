1
00:00:00.566 --> 00:00:01.766
Aren't you going to sign?

2
00:00:01.766 --> 00:00:03.733
Our wedding thrift has been sent out.

3
00:00:03.733 --> 00:00:05.766
Who sent it? Of course it was me.

4
00:00:05.766 --> 00:00:08.000
Would you still refuse at a time like this?

5
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.033
What do you think, Chen Hanchun?

6
00:00:10.066 --> 00:00:11.366
You'd better not be impulsive.

7
00:00:11.366 --> 00:00:13.000
At that time, the face of the two families will be lost

8
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.033
You are also afraid of losing face

9
00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:16.500
Of course.

10
00:00:16.533 --> 00:00:19.033
I don't want everything ready without a groom

11
00:00:19.266 --> 00:00:21.200
Then you shouldn't have all the processes ready

12
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:22.300
Just wait for me to nod

13
00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:23.966
I'm afraid you'll figure it out someday.

14
00:00:23.966 --> 00:00:25.300
But things aren't ready yet

15
00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.600
After all, the sooner this marriage is done, the better

16
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.366
Then just wait.

17
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.200
Just one last step

18
00:00:33.566 --> 00:00:35.633
Who can't have a problem at this time?
