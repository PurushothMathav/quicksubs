00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.600
I am Miss Zhou

2
00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:02.866
He Fang family is the pastor

3
00:00:02.866 --> 00:00:05.100
The sky is empty and you can't stay

4
00:00:05.533 --> 00:00:07.400
Wait until the lady wakes up before leaving

5
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:09.500
Let's go

6
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.666
Let go of me let go of me

7
00:00:14.966 --> 00:00:16.100
No one now

8
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:17.200
Can wake up

9
00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:21.900
Hey, no more

10
00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.900
Zhou Jia should send someone to the company to destroy the evidence

11
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:25.433
What!

12
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.900
You lied to me, who pretended to sleep first?

13
00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:34.000
That's not because

14
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.366
As soon as I woke up, I met Zhou Yaru confessing to you

15
00:00:36.866 --> 00:00:38.433
Hmm sorry to interrupt

16
00:00:38.966 --> 00:00:42.633
Are you satisfied with my answer?

17
00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.100
Satisfied, satisfied

18
00:00:48.533 --> 00:00:49.600
Laugh out loud

19
00:00:52.266 --> 00:00:53.600
Go let me go

20
00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:54.966
I can walk by myself

21
00:00:55.466 --> 00:00:57.200
Miss Zhou, okay?

22
00:01:01.366 --> 00:01:02.600
You lead the way

23
00:01:04.266 --> 00:01:06.866
Miss Zhou, my black belt in taekwondo

24
00:01:07.333 --> 00:01:09.300
Don't try to run in my hands

25
00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:15.933
Song Nan woke up with that woman

26
00:01:15.933 --> 00:01:17.700
It will definitely provoke Yan into a pair of Buddhas

27
00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.600
I had to do it first.

28
00:01:22.166 --> 00:01:23.200
Hello, Grandma Song

29
00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:24.166
I am Yaru

30
00:01:24.266 --> 00:01:26.466
I came back from abroad. Are you at home now?

31
00:01:26.466 --> 00:01:27.800
I will visit you tonight.

32
00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.000
Oops ok ok

33
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.166
Anytime welcome.

34
00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:31.400
Are the stars at home?

35
00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:32.766
I brought a gift to the stars

36
00:01:32.766 --> 00:01:35.033
Just got back from kindergarten

37
00:01:35.066 --> 00:01:37.166
Ah, that's great. I'll see you later.

38
00:01:40.266 --> 00:01:41.600
Star recruit

39
00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:43.266
Grandma later

40
00:01:43.266 --> 00:01:46.000
Remember to call Auntie when a guest comes to the door.

41
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.633
I know, grandma.

42
00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:54.933
Yaru is here

43
00:01:54.933 --> 00:01:57.766
Come on, come on, grandma, I haven't seen you for a long time

44
00:01:57.766 --> 00:01:59.466
Come in, sit, come in
