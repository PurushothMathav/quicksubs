00:00:04.666 --> 00:00:07.200
Zhao Zhao, let me get it for you, thank you new daddy

2
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.966
But I'm a man.

3
00:00:08.966 --> 00:00:10.833
I'll do it myself

4
00:00:14.266 --> 00:00:17.166
Wow, this is the house you bought.

5
00:00:17.566 --> 00:00:19.300
Wow, they look expensive.

6
00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.066
Didn't you ask Gao to buy a smaller house?

7
00:00:22.066 --> 00:00:26.200
I didn't rent it, I rented it.

8
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:28.766
Then let's go AA

9
00:00:28.766 --> 00:00:31.000
I'll just come without the expenses at home

10
00:00:31.733 --> 00:00:33.000
Oh, right.

11
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.200
I bought you all new toiletries.

12
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.566
See what else you need.

13
00:00:37.466 --> 00:00:39.000
Mm, thank you.

14
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:39.900
Thanks

15
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:43.366
Did this beautiful aunt really spoil my mother?

16
00:00:43.466 --> 00:00:46.066
I have a mother too. I should

17
00:00:47.266 --> 00:00:50.300
What are the stars doing there? Come here

18
00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:05.500
For you.

19
00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:07.333
Thank you Shin Shin

20
00:01:07.333 --> 00:01:08.600
Shin Shin never gets close to anyone

21
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.000
But the lady who came over from Auntie also

22
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.133
Forgot to buy a gift.

23
00:01:11.133 --> 00:01:12.066
Gave it to Duke Song Lan

24
00:01:12.066 --> 00:01:14.066
Can you wait for Auntie to come back and make it up for you?

25
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:15.500
Humph

26
00:01:16.466 --> 00:01:17.600
So nice

27
00:01:18.966 --> 00:01:20.666
Let's put our luggage in the room first

28
00:01:20.666 --> 00:01:22.400
Well, let's go.

29
00:01:27.933 --> 00:01:28.700
It's the following.

30
00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:29.700
We are flash marriage

31
00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:30.866
No emotional foundation

32
00:01:30.866 --> 00:01:31.966
Sleep in separate rooms first

33
00:01:32.766 --> 00:01:35.566
Ah, yes, I think it's fine.

34
00:01:35.733 --> 00:01:36.933
Then you clean up first

35
00:01:36.933 --> 00:01:38.466
Call me anytime you need anything

36
00:01:38.866 --> 00:01:39.866
Hey wait a minute

37
00:01:39.866 --> 00:01:41.466
What's wrong, Mr. Feng?

38
00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:42.566
It's the following.

39
00:01:42.766 --> 00:01:44.833
Chaochao kindergarten requires a hukou

40
00:01:44.933 --> 00:01:46.900
Because I wasn't married before.

41
00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:48.100
So I never gave it to him.

42
00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:49.366
He got married to register his children

43
00:01:49.366 --> 00:01:51.466
See when you have time to arrive at the previous number.

44
00:01:51.466 --> 00:01:54.066
Let's go to the police station together and give him a household registration book.

45
00:01:54.666 --> 00:01:56.600
Well, it can be done tomorrow.

46
00:01:56.966 --> 00:01:58.666
Excellent. Thank you.

47
00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:05.666
Hello Mr. Feng

48
00:02:05.766 --> 00:02:07.700
Zhaozhao and I have arrived at the entrance of the police station

49
00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:08.633
Where have you been?

50
00:02:08.666 --> 00:02:09.533
I'm so sorry.

51
00:02:09.533 --> 00:02:10.800
I just dealt with something at the company.

52
00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.900
Are you on your way here now?

53
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.433
It's alright, it's still early, take your time

54
00:02:16.966 --> 00:02:19.100
Yo, Brother Song Nan

55
00:02:19.266 --> 00:02:20.700
Hey spider look

56
00:02:20.766 --> 00:02:22.933
This is not the Song Jiajia who stole your identity

57
00:02:22.933 --> 00:02:24.600
Qian Jin Song Nan?
