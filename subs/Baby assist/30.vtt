1
00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:01.766
Paternity test is here

2
00:00:01.766 --> 00:00:03.066
Zhaozhao is my son

3
00:00:03.666 --> 00:00:04.900
Who dares to touch him?

4
00:00:06.066 --> 00:00:09.100
It was the first time I heard someone pretend to be a father

5
00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:10.966
A long paternity test

6
00:00:10.966 --> 00:00:12.300
Who will believe you?

7
00:00:12.733 --> 00:00:13.400
Sunangge

8
00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.166
I thought after you divorced me

9
00:00:15.166 --> 00:00:17.200
Broken jar broke and found a stinky brick

10
00:00:17.466 --> 00:00:20.366
I didn't expect you to find someone with a brain problem

11
00:00:20.966 --> 00:00:22.266
Rotten nest stopped

12
00:00:22.333 --> 00:00:23.800
That was amazing.

13
00:00:23.966 --> 00:00:26.000
Husband, what the hell is going on?

14
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.333
September 26, five years ago

15
00:00:27.333 --> 00:00:29.933
Royal Court Clubhouse Room 10.888 pm

16
00:00:29.933 --> 00:00:31.100
Have you forgotten?

17
00:00:31.133 --> 00:00:32.166
How do you know?

18
00:00:32.166 --> 00:00:34.500
Because it was me in room 888 that night

19
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.666
Impossible. The militia I arranged that night was

20
00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:41.166
So what?

21
00:00:41.166 --> 00:00:42.366
Zhao Hongguang is still here

22
00:00:42.366 --> 00:00:44.766
He is the duck ordered by Brother Sunan himself

23
00:00:44.766 --> 00:00:47.500
Zhao Hongguang, hurry up and tell everyone

24
00:00:47.666 --> 00:00:49.100
What the hell happened someday?

25
00:00:49.166 --> 00:00:52.400
Five years ago, Room 888 of the Royal Court Clubhouse

26
00:00:53.733 --> 00:00:56.100
I remember leading him to the room

27
00:00:56.533 --> 00:00:57.566
Later

28
00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:59.366
Later I can't remember

29
00:00:59.366 --> 00:01:00.866
Then I stepped on your foot

30
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.300
And I went into the room.

31
00:01:04.366 --> 00:01:06.700
So the man in the room is you

32
00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.033
Yes, it's impossible.

33
00:01:08.266 --> 00:01:09.366
Why not?

34
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.566
Could it be that you designed what happened back then?

35
00:01:11.566 --> 00:01:12.733
Stop talking nonsense

36
00:01:12.733 --> 00:01:13.800
No, definitely not.

37
00:01:13.933 --> 00:01:14.866
Even so

38
00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:16.766
Brother Nan still cheated on him

39
00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:18.333
You duck

40
00:01:18.333 --> 00:01:19.466
You stinky brick

41
00:01:19.466 --> 00:01:20.166
What's the difference?

42
00:01:20.166 --> 00:01:21.200
Of course there is a difference

43
00:01:21.366 --> 00:01:22.833
He's the father.

44
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:23.966
Except him.

45
00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.500
No one can take Zhaozhao away from me

46
00:01:26.566 --> 00:01:29.600
That's great. You're really my dad

47
00:01:30.866 --> 00:01:33.266
I don't care who the father of this little guy is

48
00:01:33.266 --> 00:01:35.400
This is all evidence that your Brother Sunan cheated

49
00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:39.266
I'm going to sign a contract with Feng Group in three days

50
00:01:39.733 --> 00:01:43.266
The half-fork that derailed at this critical moment

51
00:01:43.366 --> 00:01:45.200
Get out of here

52
00:01:46.466 --> 00:01:47.700
My Way Group
