00:00:01.333 --> 00:00:03.300
Hmm is that you

2
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:04.100
That's right.

3
00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:07.333
I forgot to tell you that we've been together for a long time

4
00:00:07.333 --> 00:00:09.166
People are real money

5
00:00:09.466 --> 00:00:11.466
Not like you impostor

6
00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:15.066
How many years ago did you say what your eyes were like before?

7
00:00:15.066 --> 00:00:17.666
How could you fall in love with this kind of stuff?

8
00:00:17.666 --> 00:00:18.766
Blame me for being blind

9
00:00:18.866 --> 00:00:20.500
Fortunately, you showed up in time.

10
00:00:20.733 --> 00:00:22.066
Let me stop the loss in time

11
00:00:22.466 --> 00:00:24.200
We have long since divorced

12
00:00:24.533 --> 00:00:26.800
So you've been with him for a long time

13
00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.633
Yes, sister.

14
00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:30.900
You married Brother Jingnian back then

15
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.533
My dad hasn't gotten me back yet

16
00:00:32.533 --> 00:00:34.000
Gave you a lot of dowry

17
00:00:34.266 --> 00:00:37.200
I heard that Brother Jingnian caught your card later.

18
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.833
You only agreed to go to bed and leave the house

19
00:00:40.666 --> 00:00:42.566
Ah, you don't know yet.

20
00:00:42.566 --> 00:00:43.666
That duck

21
00:00:43.666 --> 00:00:47.666
It's my sister, I personally chose it for you, hahaha.

22
00:00:48.333 --> 00:00:51.600
It's actually you. Now you have been kicked out of the Song family

23
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.333
I was dumped by the police again

24
00:00:53.333 --> 00:00:54.533
I'm afraid so.

25
00:00:54.533 --> 00:00:57.000
No man will want you as a piece of junk, right?

26
00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.866
Hahahaha

27
00:00:59.866 --> 00:01:02.000
Hey, if no man wants you

28
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
I can introduce you

29
00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.100
There is rags in the west of the city

30
00:01:06.333 --> 00:01:09.666
I just received your junk, hahahaha.

31
00:01:09.666 --> 00:01:11.700
Don't bully my mommy

32
00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.800
Yo mommy

33
00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:15.733
This Ono

34
00:01:15.733 --> 00:01:18.133
Could it be that you gave birth to that duck?

35
00:01:18.133 --> 00:01:20.266
Zhaozhao is my son, don't meet him

36
00:01:21.133 --> 00:01:24.266
Your son doesn't even know who his father is

37
00:01:24.366 --> 00:01:28.266
I belong to the small wild species

38
00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:30.700
you

39
00:01:31.266 --> 00:01:32.766
How dare you hit me?

40
00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:35.166
I'm not a little bastard

41
00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.300
I had a new world yesterday.

42
00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:38.600
You are not allowed to talk nonsense

43
00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.700
Little thing you are courting death

44
00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:42.600
Say it
