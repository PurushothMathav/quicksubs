00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.100
Feng Group

2
00:00:01.366 --> 00:00:04.333
That's right, the richest man in Haicheng has closed his house

3
00:00:04.333 --> 00:00:04.733
that since

4
00:00:04.733 --> 00:00:07.100
However, people like you will never reach it in your lifetime

5
00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:10.066
Really? I'd like to see you in three days

6
00:00:10.066 --> 00:00:12.033
How did your Song family sign a contract with Feng?

7
00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:13.300
Of course you can.

8
00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:15.000
You'd better get out of here

9
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.400
Our Song family does not welcome such poverty and misery as yours.

10
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:18.400
Just go

11
00:00:24.466 --> 00:00:25.466
Nan Ge

12
00:00:28.566 --> 00:00:29.366
you

13
00:00:30.366 --> 00:00:31.800
Great, great.

14
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.266
I have a daddy

15
00:00:33.266 --> 00:00:35.100
Daddy Daddy Hug

16
00:00:36.566 --> 00:00:39.033
Zhao Zhao, I am honored to be your father

17
00:00:39.266 --> 00:00:42.000
But daddy has something to say to your mommy

18
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.100
Can you go there and play first?

19
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.266
Oh, I understand.

20
00:00:45.266 --> 00:00:48.033
I'll make room for you two right away

21
00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:51.966
Go ahead and play

22
00:00:54.333 --> 00:00:57.300
I didn't expect you to be Chao Chao's biological father

23
00:00:57.466 --> 00:00:59.566
I see the stars as big as the morning.

24
00:00:59.566 --> 00:01:01.700
Did you have a girlfriend after that?

25
00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:03.666
It's also so old for children

26
00:01:03.666 --> 00:01:05.766
Where do stars come from without an object?

27
00:01:05.766 --> 00:01:07.366
I don't have a girlfriend

28
00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.000
This is also the question I want to ask you

29
00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:09.933
Ask me what?

30
00:01:09.933 --> 00:01:11.100
The stars are my daughters

31
00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.300
Before I met you

32
00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:14.100
I didn't have sex with any woman

33
00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.066
That star was kidnapped by kidnappers 5 years ago

34
00:01:17.333 --> 00:01:18.300
Say it's my child

35
00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:19.800
I didn't believe him.

36
00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:21.666
But they sent a paternity test

37
00:01:21.666 --> 00:01:23.366
Later, I redeemed my kiss back.

38
00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:24.900
She is indeed my daughter

39
00:01:25.366 --> 00:01:26.400
Also your daughter

40
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.300
Thanks.

41
00:01:28.266 --> 00:01:29.533
It's my daughter.

42
00:01:29.533 --> 00:01:31.833
Yeah so I wanted to ask you

43
00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:33.633
Why did you give him to the kidnappers?

44
00:01:34.066 --> 00:01:35.700
I didn't give him to the kidnappers.

45
00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.733
I gave birth to twins in the hospital

46
00:01:37.733 --> 00:01:39.866
The doctor said my sister was born stillborn

47
00:01:40.733 --> 00:01:42.400
I thought that was it

48
00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:43.400
These years

49
00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.733
I always thought it was you who traded him for wealth

50
00:01:45.733 --> 00:01:47.333
So I don't trust women very much

51
00:01:47.333 --> 00:01:49.100
How could I possibly sell a child?

52
00:01:49.133 --> 00:01:50.133
Even if I starve to death

53
00:01:50.133 --> 00:01:51.633
It's impossible to sell children

54
00:01:52.933 --> 00:01:55.266
Sorry, I misunderstood before.

55
00:01:56.466 --> 00:01:58.300
I have a confession to make.

56
00:01:58.366 --> 00:02:00.066
Now I'm not a brick mover.
