00:00:08.266 --> 00:00:09.500
Why just the two of you?

2
00:00:09.966 --> 00:00:14.266
What about mom? Mommy hasn't come back yet.

3
00:00:14.366 --> 00:00:17.266
My biological father is here

4
00:00:17.566 --> 00:00:21.533
I should be in a bad mood to rob my mommy

5
00:00:21.533 --> 00:00:24.133
Daddy, you are his husband now

6
00:00:24.133 --> 00:00:27.400
When he comes back, you have to coax him.

7
00:00:27.466 --> 00:00:28.600
biological father

8
00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:32.466
That guy doesn't look good to me

9
00:00:32.966 --> 00:00:34.966
That is, I'm not grown up now

10
00:00:34.966 --> 00:00:37.300
Otherwise, see how I teach him a lesson

11
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:39.566
Oh, I see.

12
00:00:39.766 --> 00:00:40.933
It's getting late.

13
00:00:40.933 --> 00:00:42.600
Take your sister to bed first

14
00:01:05.333 --> 00:01:06.433
What are you doing here?

15
00:01:06.933 --> 00:01:09.066
I have something to do with you.

16
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.600
How much alcohol did you drink?

17
00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.000
i

18
00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.666
I have something to say to you. What's the matter?

19
00:01:21.366 --> 00:01:22.200
We

20
00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:25.066
Hmm, get a divorce.

21
00:01:25.133 --> 00:01:26.200
divorce

22
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.700
My biological father came and robbed my mommy

23
00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.600
Should be in a bad mood

24
00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.100
Because Cao Cao's father

25
00:01:35.133 --> 00:01:36.466
Don't mention him to me

26
00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.600
He is a personal god

27
00:01:40.966 --> 00:01:43.100
Why am I so unlucky?

28
00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.366
You said if you knew

29
00:01:46.666 --> 00:01:48.633
You have to know that your father is such a scumbag

30
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.666
Will you be like them?

31
00:01:50.966 --> 00:01:53.900
Don't want to be with me anymore, will you?

32
00:01:54.733 --> 00:01:56.100
I don't want to divorce you.

33
00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:58.100
Can you ask me to get dressed?

34
00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:59.200
that

35
00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:00.633
Then you

36
00:02:01.666 --> 00:02:03.700
Don't plan to divorce me

37
00:02:04.733 --> 00:02:08.266
Can you let me put my clothes on first?

38
00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:09.300
Hey

39
00:02:11.733 --> 00:02:13.700
Uh-huh.
