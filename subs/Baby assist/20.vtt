00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:04.433
Great grandma, dad and my mom just got married

2
00:00:06.666 --> 00:00:08.966
The meal is ready, let's eat

3
00:00:08.966 --> 00:00:12.633
Come on, let's go eat, come eat

4
00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:14.466
Thank you, Nan

5
00:00:14.466 --> 00:00:17.366
It's not hard to make such a big table of dishes

6
00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.833
Come on, kids, eat more food!

7
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.300
Come recruit and eat a carrot

8
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.000
Thank you, Grandma

9
00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:29.333
But grandma, I don't eat carrots.

10
00:00:29.333 --> 00:00:31.266
You are just like our Yanchen.

11
00:00:31.266 --> 00:00:33.700
Don't like carrots, yeah

12
00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:42.133
This kid

13
00:00:42.133 --> 00:00:45.300
No matter how you look at it, you really look like a child of the Queen Feng family

14
00:00:45.966 --> 00:00:47.500
Hey, let's go, babies.

15
00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.966
After dinner, let's go to the living room to watch TV.

16
00:00:51.366 --> 00:00:53.900
Ah, let me do the dishes. Today

17
00:00:54.333 --> 00:00:55.633
Then please.

18
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.366
Where's grandma, I just left

19
00:01:05.366 --> 00:01:06.866
Would you like some fruit?

20
00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:08.533
Oh, no.

21
00:01:08.533 --> 00:01:11.500
I'm going to make a call, you rest early

22
00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:18.400
How did that happen?

23
00:01:18.866 --> 00:01:19.900
I don't know.

24
00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:21.366
Suddenly the power went out.

25
00:01:21.366 --> 00:01:22.600
Is there a power outage?

26
00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:23.766
No blackouts.

27
00:01:24.566 --> 00:01:26.366
Is the light bulb in the room broken?

28
00:01:26.366 --> 00:01:27.833
Try changing a light bulb

29
00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.166
Change the light bulb

30
00:01:30.166 --> 00:01:31.366
You wouldn't.

31
00:01:32.533 --> 00:01:33.766
Okay, I'll do it.

32
00:01:45.133 --> 00:01:46.300
You change light bulbs.

33
00:01:47.566 --> 00:01:49.466
For so many years, I have been raising children alone

34
00:01:49.466 --> 00:01:50.333
Why not?

35
00:01:50.333 --> 00:01:51.666
Have long learned

36
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.266
He seems

37
00:01:54.266 --> 00:01:56.900
She's not like any girl I've ever met before

38
00:01:56.933 --> 00:02:00.633
Maybe I should let go of those prejudices

39
00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:06.100
All right.

40
00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:45.366
Did he really socialize with you as a child?
