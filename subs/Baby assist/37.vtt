1
00:00:01.066 --> 00:00:03.633
I'll take this dress.

2
00:00:03.766 --> 00:00:05.166
It's Miss Song

3
00:00:05.166 --> 00:00:07.233
Miss Song, you have such a good eye.

4
00:00:07.266 --> 00:00:08.366
What about this dress?

5
00:00:08.366 --> 00:00:09.933
Is our chief designer

6
00:00:09.933 --> 00:00:11.666
It took two years to design.

7
00:00:11.666 --> 00:00:13.933
Not everyone can wear it casually

8
00:00:13.933 --> 00:00:17.066
However, with your appearance and bearing like Miss Song

9
00:00:17.066 --> 00:00:19.100
It's definitely no problem to wear it.

10
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.800
You're right, after all 800,000 clothes

11
00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.266
Some people can't afford takeout for a lifetime

12
00:00:24.266 --> 00:00:25.666
Are you right, sister?

13
00:00:25.966 --> 00:00:28.466
Wasn't my sister a designer before?

14
00:00:28.466 --> 00:00:30.800
Why is it reduced to delivery now?

15
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.433
Why are you so poor?

16
00:00:33.533 --> 00:00:36.266
It's just a part-time job outside of my job

17
00:00:36.966 --> 00:00:37.800
Oh, dear.

18
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.633
Look at what's on your clothes

19
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.066
You don't want to come here to buy clothes, do you?

20
00:00:44.733 --> 00:00:46.300
Do you know how much this dress costs?

21
00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:47.333
Can you afford that?

22
00:00:47.333 --> 00:00:48.300
That's my business.

23
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.300
Come to the luxury store

24
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.433
And pretend to treat money as dung

25
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:54.933
For whom?

26
00:00:54.933 --> 00:00:56.933
Tens of thousands of dollars a piece of clothing

27
00:00:56.933 --> 00:01:00.700
Your husband who moves bricks can't satisfy you, right?

28
00:01:01.466 --> 00:01:02.800
What's your business?

29
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.166
My husband is doing well

30
00:01:04.166 --> 00:01:05.900
It's better than a few years

31
00:01:05.966 --> 00:01:08.866
It's good to count the scum of the person next to you for money

32
00:01:08.866 --> 00:01:09.766
A thousand times.

33
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.500
Remember that the last person was me.

34
00:01:12.866 --> 00:01:14.066
You are next.

35
00:01:14.066 --> 00:01:15.533
I'm not like you.

36
00:01:15.533 --> 00:01:17.266
Brother Jing Ning really likes me

37
00:01:17.266 --> 00:01:19.133
What he did to you before

38
00:01:19.133 --> 00:01:21.266
Just to be with me

39
00:01:21.766 --> 00:01:23.833
So you've already hooked up

40
00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:25.633
Not just to get me a divorce

41
00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.133
I want to ask me to kick out of the Song family

42
00:01:27.133 --> 00:01:27.866
Yes!

43
00:01:27.866 --> 00:01:30.566
Even the ducks are personally selected for you by me.

44
00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.366
It's a pity that you escaped

45
00:01:32.366 --> 00:01:33.633
But it doesn't matter.

46
00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.566
I still ruined you

47
00:01:37.066 --> 00:01:39.333
Song Mingzhu, I have never offended you, have I?

48
00:01:39.333 --> 00:01:40.800
If you think I robbed you of your life

49
00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:42.066
I have returned it to you.

50
00:01:42.066 --> 00:01:43.333
Why be so mean?

51
00:01:43.333 --> 00:01:44.900
Shamelessly ruined my life

52
00:01:45.133 --> 00:01:46.700
Never offended me

53
00:01:46.733 --> 00:01:48.500
You think you're giving me my life back?

54
00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.500
Can everything in the past be written off?

55
00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.066
You are in the Song family

56
00:01:52.066 --> 00:01:54.166
I was starving and freezing outside

57
00:01:54.166 --> 00:01:56.300
I like the idea of a few years, three years apart.

58
00:01:56.333 --> 00:01:58.166
He is because you are the eldest lady of the Song family

59
00:01:58.166 --> 00:01:59.400
Dare not refuse you

60
00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.800
And I swore, if I had the chance

61
00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:03.566
I must make your life worse than death
