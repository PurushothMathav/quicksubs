00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:01.666
Do you have a car? Do you have a house?

2
00:00:01.666 --> 00:00:02.666
Is the job stable?

3
00:00:02.666 --> 00:00:04.733
How many marriages and how many children?

4
00:00:04.733 --> 00:00:06.700
An RV must have one.

5
00:00:06.733 --> 00:00:07.900
5 marriages

6
00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:09.600
Three daughters?

7
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:11.400
What if your mother marries me?

8
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:12.633
Don't go out.

9
00:00:12.866 --> 00:00:14.166
Give me a son

10
00:00:14.166 --> 00:00:16.266
It's okay, just take the baby at home

11
00:00:16.466 --> 00:00:18.633
I have three daughters and still have to give birth

12
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:23.266
Uncle fixes your mind all day long

13
00:00:23.466 --> 00:00:24.666
Excuse me.

14
00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:26.466
Your height and appearance

15
00:00:26.766 --> 00:00:30.000
Its plans for the future are not suitable for my mother and you

16
00:00:31.466 --> 00:00:35.866
Hey, today is also a day when I failed to find my father.

17
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:38.666
Let a kid come on a blind date with me

18
00:00:38.666 --> 00:00:40.400
They also dislike my height and appearance

19
00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:41.600
A married person.

20
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.133
I see what else you can find

21
00:00:43.133 --> 00:00:44.566
Che hum

22
00:00:45.333 --> 00:00:47.066
Marry your grandson

23
00:00:47.066 --> 00:00:48.766
Someone as good as me

24
00:00:48.766 --> 00:00:50.000
Bride price 3 million

25
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.833
I have to pay for my monthly living expenses 50,000 and?

26
00:00:52.933 --> 00:00:55.100
Household chores have to be handled by the nanny

27
00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:56.466
My hands

28
00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.033
Can it be used for cooking?

29
00:00:58.066 --> 00:00:59.333
That's easy to say.

30
00:00:59.333 --> 00:01:01.066
This is my little star.

31
00:01:01.066 --> 00:01:02.333
You have to take care of it

32
00:01:02.333 --> 00:01:05.066
He is not in good health and does not like to communicate with others

33
00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.766
You need to spend more time with him

34
00:01:06.966 --> 00:01:08.166
Be a good mother

35
00:01:08.166 --> 00:01:09.000
how

36
00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.466
Let me take care of a child born to another woman

37
00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:12.466
Dream

38
00:01:13.133 --> 00:01:14.166
Let an old woman

39
00:01:14.166 --> 00:01:15.566
Bring a little something out on a blind date

40
00:01:15.566 --> 00:01:16.766
Weird enough

41
00:01:16.933 --> 00:01:18.866
You want me to take care of this little thing?

42
00:01:18.866 --> 00:01:20.766
Xiaoya who doesn't even want a mother

43
00:01:21.766 --> 00:01:24.566
How can you say that about stars?

44
00:01:24.566 --> 00:01:25.800
Am I wrong?

45
00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.266
Has he said a word since he just walked in the door?

46
00:01:29.266 --> 00:01:30.900
I don't think it's just a little dumb

47
00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.200
He's a little fool, right?

48
00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.866
Little fool, did your mother run away because of you?

49
00:01:37.166 --> 00:01:39.233
Oops, all just came out for a blind date.

50
00:01:39.733 --> 00:01:41.633
Hahahaha

51
00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.466
Don't bully the elderly and children in broad daylight

52
00:01:52.966 --> 00:01:54.333
Come and continue

53
00:01:54.333 --> 00:01:56.100
I'll see if I can get a hot search today.

54
00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.033
Who are you? Mind your own business

55
00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:59.733
I'm just someone who doesn't like you.

56
00:01:59.733 --> 00:02:01.600
A passerby who bullies the elderly and children

57
00:02:01.666 --> 00:02:03.100
People and children are so cute

58
00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.400
Where did I provoke you to bully him like this?

59
00:02:05.733 --> 00:02:07.266
Don't worry.

60
00:02:07.266 --> 00:02:10.366
As long as I'm around, no one dares to bully him

61
00:02:10.366 --> 00:02:13.433
Be gentle, he will protect me

62
00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.266
Like a mother on TV

63
00:02:20.166 --> 00:02:20.966
Mommy

64
00:02:21.533 --> 00:02:23.066
Why are you here?

65
00:02:23.166 --> 00:02:25.933
I tried your blind date for you today.

66
00:02:25.933 --> 00:02:28.866
He can't, let's meet again tomorrow

67
00:02:29.166 --> 00:02:30.966
So you are also here for a blind date.

68
00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:33.300
Since you like this little mute's words so much

69
00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:34.866
Then you should be his mother

70
00:02:35.066 --> 00:02:36.700
The girl was born handsome

71
00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.200
So kind at heart

72
00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.266
It's just right to be a star mother

73
00:02:40.266 --> 00:02:41.466
That's a good idea.

74
00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.166
Girl, my grandson is excellent

75
00:02:44.266 --> 00:02:45.533
Hey, wait a minute.

76
00:02:45.533 --> 00:02:47.300
I'll call him right away.

77
00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:49.166
You will definitely like him.

78
00:02:49.166 --> 00:02:50.833
Hahaha yes

79
00:02:50.966 --> 00:02:52.866
I won't change it today.

80
00:02:54.866 --> 00:02:56.500
Where is the brat

81
00:02:56.533 --> 00:02:58.066
Come to me for a blind date immediately

82
00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.600
Grandma, you're going to help me on a blind date again

83
00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:02.766
Didn't I tell you?

84
00:03:02.766 --> 00:03:05.366
I don't beat brats now, you're 30 years old

85
00:03:05.366 --> 00:03:07.333
If you don't come and give me a blind date today?

86
00:03:07.333 --> 00:03:09.500
I took the stars and ran away from home

87
00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:11.566
My grandparents and I went outside to fend for ourselves

88
00:03:11.566 --> 00:03:12.600
Old age and death

89
00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:13.833
I mean what I say.

90
00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:15.133
The address will be sent to you later.

91
00:03:15.133 --> 00:03:16.666
No one was seen for 20 minutes

92
00:03:16.666 --> 00:03:18.600
You will never see me and Xingxing again

93
00:03:21.466 --> 00:03:22.433
Go on a blind date

94
00:03:25.966 --> 00:03:28.533
Girl, come, come and sit here

95
00:03:28.533 --> 00:03:31.000
My grandson will be here soon.
