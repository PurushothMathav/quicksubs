00:00:11.966 --> 00:00:15.533
It's you, who did I think it was?

2
00:00:15.533 --> 00:00:17.933
It turned out to be you stinky brick carrier

3
00:00:17.933 --> 00:00:19.133
Come and see.

4
00:00:19.133 --> 00:00:20.566
This is Brother Song Nan

5
00:00:20.566 --> 00:00:22.766
His husband moved bricks on the construction site

6
00:00:23.533 --> 00:00:23.800
Hey

7
00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.733
Don't tell me how much you paid to rent this outfit

8
00:00:26.733 --> 00:00:28.566
Kind of fucking like that

9
00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.066
Do so many actors

10
00:00:30.166 --> 00:00:32.466
Do you have enough money?

11
00:00:32.466 --> 00:00:34.100
Ah brother

12
00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:35.566
The cat is there

13
00:00:50.266 --> 00:00:52.000
Brother Sinan, are you alright?

14
00:00:54.066 --> 00:00:55.166
It doesn't look too laborious.

15
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.300
Fortunately, it's in time

16
00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:57.966
cat cat

17
00:00:58.166 --> 00:01:00.066
How should Mr. Feng deal with these people?

18
00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:04.666
Mr. Fang, the actors you hired are not professional either.

19
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.500
The entire Sea City dares to claim that there is only one person in the wind

20
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.233
That is Feng Yanchen of the Wind Group

21
00:01:10.533 --> 00:01:12.400
He's never like this.

22
00:01:12.533 --> 00:01:13.966
Dare to impersonate him

23
00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:16.400
How dare you!

24
00:01:17.366 --> 00:01:19.833
The bold one is that you can rely on it

25
00:01:21.366 --> 00:01:22.166
Ah!

26
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:23.966
Who are you?

27
00:01:23.966 --> 00:01:24.800
Why arrest me

28
00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.300
Let go of me. Which hand did they touch?

29
00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:29.000
Which hand did they lose?

30
00:01:29.866 --> 00:01:32.266
Wu Yanchen, I'm so uncomfortable

31
00:01:32.333 --> 00:01:33.633
I'll take you to the hospital right away

32
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.066
This dream meeting

33
00:01:40.933 --> 00:01:41.733
how

34
00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:43.600
sample

35
00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:47.900
Hey

36
00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.200
Am I in such a hurry?

37
00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:51.500
No more child.

38
00:01:51.533 --> 00:01:54.300
Hey, I have to leave this house without me

39
00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.466
Uncle Gao's sister is still in school

40
00:01:56.466 --> 00:01:59.866
Let's go back to pick up Sister Xingxing first

41
00:02:00.666 --> 00:02:02.066
Oh drive away

42
00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.300
How long will it take to get to the hospital?

43
00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:06.133
The president is 20 minutes away from the nearest hospital

44
00:02:06.133 --> 00:02:07.433
Drive faster yes

45
00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:09.100
So hot

46
00:02:10.666 --> 00:02:11.600
Help me.

47
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.800
Brother Sunan, wake up

48
00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.166
Hold on!

49
00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:31.966
Is it him?
