00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:01.400
Bloodline

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.566
Doctor, you may be mistaken.

3
00:00:03.566 --> 00:00:05.400
I'm not the child's biological child, by the way

4
00:00:05.466 --> 00:00:06.400
Be careful in the future

5
00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.300
The child must not be stimulated anymore

6
00:00:08.333 --> 00:00:09.866
You should also pay attention to your diet

7
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.466
Only by combining multiple parties can children recover slowly

8
00:00:12.566 --> 00:00:14.300
Okay, let's get the medicine

9
00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:17.066
The stars go

10
00:00:18.166 --> 00:00:19.466
It's okay, I'll do it.

11
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.100
Thank you

12
00:00:21.733 --> 00:00:23.766
Let's go

13
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.466
The pair of dragon and phoenix fetuses I gave birth to back then

14
00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.233
Only Chao Chao survived

15
00:00:28.766 --> 00:00:31.433
If only the stars were my child

16
00:00:36.666 --> 00:00:38.366
Breastfeeding dust?

17
00:00:38.366 --> 00:00:40.866
I heard that Little Star is autistic again.

18
00:00:40.866 --> 00:00:42.000
How is it now?

19
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.333
The mood has stabilized

20
00:00:43.333 --> 00:00:44.700
Don't worry, grandma. Ouch.

21
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.733
I have arrived at your current place.

22
00:00:46.733 --> 00:00:48.800
Hurry up and let me see my little Tibetan granddaughter

23
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.300
What? Are you where I live now?

24
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.066
Oh my little star

25
00:00:54.466 --> 00:00:57.800
The little appearance is too grandma, and my heart hurts to death.

26
00:00:58.133 --> 00:01:00.800
Grandma, I told you

27
00:01:00.866 --> 00:01:02.400
The stars have stabilized

28
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:03.800
You don't have to come

29
00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.400
If it stabilizes, you can stop talking to me.

30
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:07.666
If I don't ask Xiao Gao

31
00:01:07.666 --> 00:01:10.300
I didn't know you guys moved here now.

32
00:01:12.166 --> 00:01:13.866
Brother Nan

33
00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:15.333
I heard it's still you today

34
00:01:15.333 --> 00:01:17.766
Holding the little star to the hospital

35
00:01:18.166 --> 00:01:20.833
Fortunately, there is you, hahaha.

36
00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.200
Whoops, but you're both married

37
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.200
My Yanchen

38
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.000
How can you still live in such an environment?

39
00:01:28.133 --> 00:01:30.033
There is no toilet in our house.

40
00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:32.500
Grandma, what nonsense are you talking about?

41
00:01:32.666 --> 00:01:35.033
The toilet in our hometown is as big as that one.

42
00:01:35.066 --> 00:01:37.600
Isn't it a pig farmer?

43
00:01:37.966 --> 00:01:39.400
How can it be the same?

44
00:01:40.266 --> 00:01:41.266
raise pigs

45
00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:47.900
Ah, grandma, why don't you stay for dinner?

46
00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:48.766
I'm going to cook

47
00:01:48.766 --> 00:01:50.266
Hahaha

48
00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:51.833
I'll go, then.

49
00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.600
Just do it

50
00:01:55.466 --> 00:01:57.600
Grandma eats fruit

51
00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.666
Ouch, this is Brother Nan's child, right? Hahaha.

52
00:02:05.333 --> 00:02:08.566
Hey, I didn't pay attention at the cafe before.

53
00:02:08.766 --> 00:02:10.366
Now look carefully.

54
00:02:10.366 --> 00:02:12.933
Why is it so similar to my family when Yanchen was young?

55
00:02:12.933 --> 00:02:14.966
Grandma, don't talk nonsense

56
00:02:15.166 --> 00:02:16.700
I'm not talking nonsense.

57
00:02:16.933 --> 00:02:19.966
He really looks just like you when you were a kid

58
00:02:19.966 --> 00:02:20.966
brat

59
00:02:21.133 --> 00:02:24.200
Are you sure this is not your homeless son?
