00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:02.566
Your kindergarten is such an eye-opener

2
00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:07.466
This is me, the father of the wind chimp and Song Zhaozhao

3
00:00:07.933 --> 00:00:10.833
Yo, it's you stinky brick carrier

4
00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:12.500
I haven't taken off my clothes yet

5
00:00:12.966 --> 00:00:14.333
It was a brick mover

6
00:00:14.333 --> 00:00:15.066
When?

7
00:00:15.066 --> 00:00:17.566
Children who move bricks can also enter our kindergarten

8
00:00:18.066 --> 00:00:19.966
This is the quality of your kindergarten teacher

9
00:00:20.066 --> 00:00:22.000
You are a coolie on a construction site

10
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.166
Understand what is literacy

11
00:00:23.166 --> 00:00:25.033
We are an advanced kindergarten

12
00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:27.366
How could you, a stinky brick-carrying child, come in?

13
00:00:27.366 --> 00:00:29.533
I said these two kids speak different words

14
00:00:29.533 --> 00:00:31.300
It must be your child who lied

15
00:00:31.766 --> 00:00:33.700
That's how low education is for the poor.

16
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:35.800
You're right actually.

17
00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.166
An honest person like you

18
00:00:37.166 --> 00:00:39.400
This school really doesn't deserve my child

19
00:00:39.733 --> 00:00:40.800
If so

20
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:41.900
Then you take the order.

21
00:00:44.966 --> 00:00:46.733
Dean Wang, I am Fang Yanchen

22
00:00:46.733 --> 00:00:48.833
I'll give you five minutes to come to the office

23
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.900
Otherwise, the investment will be cancelled.

24
00:00:51.533 --> 00:00:52.866
Stop acting

25
00:00:52.866 --> 00:00:54.466
What do you know about investing?

26
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:55.933
Our dean Wang's younger brother

27
00:00:55.933 --> 00:00:57.700
But the executives of the Feng Group

28
00:00:57.733 --> 00:01:00.000
How can you shout that stinky brick carrier?

29
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.600
If I shout

30
00:01:01.933 --> 00:01:03.600
It's all rubbish at one house

31
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.966
The little ones lie, the big ones lie.

32
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.366
You stinky trash, if you really shout

33
00:01:08.366 --> 00:01:10.066
I apologize to Li Huixia

34
00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.400
The question is, can you shout?

35
00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.266
Hey, it's alright.

36
00:01:14.466 --> 00:01:15.266
You shout

37
00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.366
I can shout

38
00:01:17.366 --> 00:01:20.000
I will send a message to Dean Wang now.

39
00:01:20.266 --> 00:01:24.433
Let him come and expose you stinky brick carrier himself

40
00:01:24.766 --> 00:01:27.833
Get out of here with these little bastards by the way

41
00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.433
This is good for me.

42
00:01:30.466 --> 00:01:33.166
The most despised is the poor guy who only knows how to brag

43
00:01:33.333 --> 00:01:34.933
Forget it if you have no money

44
00:01:34.933 --> 00:01:36.433
Dreaming all day

45
00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.866
It just brought down our entire kindergarten

46
00:01:40.066 --> 00:01:41.000
Mr. Feng

47
00:01:41.133 --> 00:01:44.000
Why don't we transfer the child to a hospital?

48
00:01:44.133 --> 00:01:45.866
You don't believe me either

49
00:01:46.266 --> 00:01:48.666
It's just that he has the Song family as his backer

50
00:01:48.666 --> 00:01:50.766
I'm afraid Dean Wang will come later, don't worry.

51
00:01:50.933 --> 00:01:52.266
Dare to bully my child

52
00:01:52.266 --> 00:01:53.866
No one is his backer

53
00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:56.400
Dean Wang

54
00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.866
Did you come here after seeing the message sent by Mr. Cheng?

55
00:01:58.866 --> 00:02:00.100
It's this poor family

56
00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:01.733
What else do you dare to say?

57
00:02:01.733 --> 00:02:03.866
You have five minutes to come to the office

58
00:02:03.866 --> 00:02:06.600
Don't be afraid to flash your tongue when you say such a big word

59
00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:07.900
You quickly dismantle them

60
00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:09.433
Show them some color and shut up

61
00:02:11.066 --> 00:02:13.766
Dean Wang, you have a few words

62
00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.900
just right

63
00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:16.900
Take these ducklings

64
00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:17.866
Get out of here

65
00:02:18.166 --> 00:02:19.800
Um, I'm sorry.

66
00:02:20.133 --> 00:02:22.466
They're not the ones who got me out of kindergarten

67
00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.266
Is your nephew

68
00:02:24.466 --> 00:02:26.366
Dare to drive them out

69
00:02:26.966 --> 00:02:28.066
What do you mean?

70
00:02:28.066 --> 00:02:29.500
I donated 1 million to the school

71
00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.000
Do you want me to take it back?

72
00:02:31.333 --> 00:02:33.500
Yes, Dean, are you talking about the wrong person?

73
00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.466
It's this poor family that should get out

74
00:02:35.466 --> 00:02:36.266
Let's go

75
00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.200
Do you know who this is?

76
00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:40.866
This is the president of the Fung Corporation.

77
00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:45.566
Mr. Fang

78
00:02:45.566 --> 00:02:48.166
We found the surveillance of the Royal Court Club 5 years ago

79
00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:49.066
surveillance alert
