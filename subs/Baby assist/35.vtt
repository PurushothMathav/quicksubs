00:00:02.666 --> 00:00:04.566
Husband manager

2
00:00:04.566 --> 00:00:05.966
Why are you here?

3
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.733
This delivery guy broke our jade bracelet.

4
00:00:08.733 --> 00:00:10.233
I'm asking him to lose money.

5
00:00:10.966 --> 00:00:12.100
Nonsense

6
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.500
I can see clearly from outside

7
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.300
I clearly saw that you broke it.

8
00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:17.833
Return the account to someone else.

9
00:00:19.066 --> 00:00:19.866
manager

10
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.566
Excuse me, Miss.

11
00:00:23.866 --> 00:00:26.300
It was the fault of the staff in our store.

12
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.000
We will compensate you for a jade bracelet of the same style.

13
00:00:29.366 --> 00:00:30.633
Hurry up and get the jade bracelet

14
00:00:33.866 --> 00:00:34.700
This jade bracelet

15
00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.400
I'll pay you, sorry?

16
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.466
No, this bracelet is worth 500,000

17
00:00:40.466 --> 00:00:42.300
Just figure out the truth

18
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:46.466
It is indeed us who have caused inconvenience to your work.

19
00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.266
Please be sure to accept it

20
00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.566
Since they insist on apologizing

21
00:00:50.666 --> 00:00:51.966
Take it then.

22
00:00:55.566 --> 00:00:57.933
Manager, why is this?

23
00:00:57.933 --> 00:00:59.800
He's just a delivery guy.

24
00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:00.666
bullshit

25
00:01:01.133 --> 00:01:03.533
Isn't it a decent job to deliver food?

26
00:01:03.533 --> 00:01:06.300
Delivery is fine. Do you mean humiliation when you say humiliation?

27
00:01:06.333 --> 00:01:09.400
Tell you that you are fired from now on

28
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.966
There is also compensation for the original price of the jade bracelet case.

29
00:01:12.166 --> 00:01:14.300
Do you want to wait for jail?

30
00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:15.100
What!

31
00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.433
Although this is indeed the employee's fault

32
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:20.900
But why do I always feel

33
00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:22.566
Is there something wrong with this manager?

34
00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:25.433
This jade bracelet is worth 500,000 say it will be given away

35
00:01:25.766 --> 00:01:27.900
Are you trying to set us up?

36
00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.166
Say we stole it then

37
00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.100
At least it's such a big mall

38
00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.866
There are surveillance cameras around, no

39
00:01:33.933 --> 00:01:35.933
That's right

40
00:01:35.933 --> 00:01:37.466
But why are you here?

41
00:01:38.666 --> 00:01:40.233
I'm here to buy something for the kids.

42
00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:42.633
But how did you start delivering takeout?

43
00:01:43.166 --> 00:01:44.666
I want to make more money.

44
00:01:44.666 --> 00:01:46.133
Don't work so hard

45
00:01:46.133 --> 00:01:47.566
You see the clothes are dirty

46
00:01:47.566 --> 00:01:50.600
I'll take you to buy a dress. Okay.

47
00:01:52.066 --> 00:01:54.300
I really took the jade bracelet.

48
00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:55.866
Of course, of course.

49
00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.066
Walk slowly, you two, walk slowly.

50
00:01:58.066 --> 00:01:59.500
Hey, take your time.

51
00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.466
Something without eyes

52
00:02:01.466 --> 00:02:02.600
That's our president.

53
00:02:03.466 --> 00:02:04.866
Madam President, you dare to provoke

54
00:02:05.366 --> 00:02:08.166
I see you really ate the bear heart and the leopard hit you

55
00:02:08.166 --> 00:02:09.100
He is

56
00:02:09.666 --> 00:02:11.100
Mrs. President
