00:00:11.166 --> 00:00:11.466
That

2
00:00:11.466 --> 00:00:13.533
Isn't that the manager who just gave us the jade bracelet?

3
00:00:13.533 --> 00:00:15.766
Why does it seem to be bowing to us?

4
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.300
No, I don't.

5
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.600
After all, they are serving consumers

6
00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.400
Maybe it's polite, right?

7
00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:24.200
Don't we still need to take recruits and leave school?

8
00:00:24.933 --> 00:00:26.400
Let's hurry to school

9
00:00:32.166 --> 00:00:32.966
star

10
00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.066
Mom's Lego has arrived.

11
00:00:35.066 --> 00:00:37.300
See if you like it or not

12
00:00:38.933 --> 00:00:41.633
Xingxing, you just spoke

13
00:00:43.066 --> 00:00:45.033
Can you say it again?

14
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.633
The stars have not spoken for a long time

15
00:00:52.866 --> 00:00:54.633
I just heard him talk and I thought

16
00:00:55.133 --> 00:00:58.933
Dumb brother, this means that my sister's situation is getting better

17
00:00:58.933 --> 00:01:01.366
Don't worry, I'll be your brother

18
00:01:01.366 --> 00:01:04.400
My sister's situation will definitely get better in the future.

19
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:05.800
Right, sister?

20
00:01:17.533 --> 00:01:18.866
It seems that the stars really like you.

21
00:01:18.866 --> 00:01:20.800
He hasn't spoken for a long time

22
00:01:21.733 --> 00:01:24.366
How do stars get autism?

23
00:01:24.366 --> 00:01:26.433
I was busy working when he was little

24
00:01:26.666 --> 00:01:28.266
They had somebody take care of them.

25
00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.166
But I didn't know he was a vicious person.

26
00:01:31.166 --> 00:01:33.066
Abused him for 3 months before I found out

27
00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:34.966
He has become like this

28
00:01:35.166 --> 00:01:36.100
What!

29
00:01:36.766 --> 00:01:38.966
I must find a way to make him better
