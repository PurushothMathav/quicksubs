00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.466
Husband, you can't

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.600
I'm not married to a lunatic

3
00:00:04.666 --> 00:00:06.000
He is a fake relative

4
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.966
I don't believe him

5
00:00:10.966 --> 00:00:14.233
Manager Qian, why didn't you notify me when you said you came?

6
00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:16.000
So I can meet you at the door?

7
00:00:16.066 --> 00:00:18.733
Manager Qian has a loser pretending to be Mr. Feng

8
00:00:18.733 --> 00:00:20.300
You're about to have him fired

9
00:00:20.333 --> 00:00:22.766
Manager Qin is Mr. Feng's right-hand man

10
00:00:22.766 --> 00:00:24.800
Got a lot of big orders for the way

11
00:00:24.866 --> 00:00:26.900
And also deeply trusted by Mr. Feng

12
00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:29.066
How dare you pretend to be crazy in front of Manager Qin?

13
00:00:29.066 --> 00:00:29.966
How is it over?

14
00:00:29.966 --> 00:00:31.766
Do you hear me pumping bricks?

15
00:00:31.766 --> 00:00:33.166
Tell you to be bold and let me go

16
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.400
Husband, I don't want to read

17
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:36.533
How do we go now?

18
00:00:36.533 --> 00:00:39.366
Is it too late to leave now?

19
00:00:39.366 --> 00:00:42.233
Or you yell three times at the door I'm a bitch

20
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.300
Maybe I'll still be in front of the former manager

21
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.966
A few words for each of you

22
00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.166
Shut up!

23
00:00:49.166 --> 00:00:51.900
Yes, how to deal with this fake wind resistance?

24
00:00:52.466 --> 00:00:54.033
It's all fried in the Qin scriptures

25
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.600
We're kind of going to jail.

26
00:00:57.733 --> 00:00:59.033
Say less

27
00:01:00.166 --> 00:01:03.300
Mr. Feng, I'm sorry I'm late.
