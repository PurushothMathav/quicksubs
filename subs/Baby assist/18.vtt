00:00:02.366 --> 00:00:04.266
I'll put the stars down first

2
00:00:04.266 --> 00:00:06.966
Then I'll go cook first and make you something delicious

3
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.233
What is Xiao Zhang drawing?

00:00:19.166 --> 00:00:25.166
What are you drawing hahahahahahaha

5
00:00:31.366 --> 00:00:34.800
The chirping of cicadas is like the twilight of Mercury in exchange for the sky

6
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.033
Let it disappear during the rainy season

7
00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.600
10,000 people are not crowded

8
00:00:44.766 --> 00:00:47.666
Like a super lift hand on a shelf you just

9
00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:49.566
Stand here.

10
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.966
Mom, let me serve the bowl.

00:00:53.666 --> 00:00:55.233
Zhao Zhao, let me come

12
00:00:55.266 --> 00:00:57.233
Can you go and wake up your sister for dinner?

13
00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.100
Guaranteed to complete the task

14
00:01:03.766 --> 00:01:06.100
Sister Xingxing gets up to eat

15
00:01:06.133 --> 00:01:09.466
Today, Mommy made braised pork ribs, which are very fragrant.

16
00:01:10.466 --> 00:01:11.300
Ah!

17
00:01:11.866 --> 00:01:13.166
What's wrong with my sister?

18
00:01:13.166 --> 00:01:14.666
I am brother

19
00:01:15.666 --> 00:01:18.300
What's wrong, I don't know.

20
00:01:18.366 --> 00:01:21.700
He just called Sister Xingxing to dinner, and that's it.

21
00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.400
Star autism attack ah ah ah ah

22
00:01:28.066 --> 00:01:30.133
It must be the bad guy Ugly Xiaolong.

23
00:01:30.133 --> 00:01:32.033
Let my sister be irritated

24
00:01:32.066 --> 00:01:32.966
Sister is not afraid

25
00:01:32.966 --> 00:01:34.366
Brother protects you

26
00:01:34.966 --> 00:01:37.866
Hey, if you can't, hurry up and send it to the hospital.

27
00:01:38.533 --> 00:01:40.500
Hey, why don't I come?

28
00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.833
Stars, stars come

29
00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.800
I'll take you to the hospital, okay?

30
00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.000
Sir, autism attacks reject any

31
00:01:52.066 --> 00:01:53.300
Now I can enter the hospital

32
00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:54.866
I'll take you to the hospital, okay?

33
00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:56.300
Let's go

34
00:01:59.166 --> 00:02:00.400
The medicine has been prescribed.

35
00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.333
As for the children you mentioned, they don't reject their mothers.

36
00:02:02.333 --> 00:02:03.800
This situation is possible

37
00:02:03.933 --> 00:02:05.233
After all, blood is connected

38
00:02:05.466 --> 00:02:06.866
During the onset of autism

39
00:02:06.866 --> 00:02:08.866
Children can also feel the breath of their mother

40
00:02:09.166 --> 00:02:11.300
During this time, the mother can spend more time with the child

41
00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:12.666
Helps patients recover

42
00:02:13.066 --> 00:02:14.500
Bloodline
