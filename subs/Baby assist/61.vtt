00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:08.666
Why is the door closed?

2
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.466
You are locked by the key.

3
00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.300
Hello? Hello?

4
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:22.366
Anybody?

5
00:00:27.733 --> 00:00:28.566
You put the design department

6
00:00:28.566 --> 00:00:30.300
Summarize the results for this quarter

7
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.366
I want a good director on Friday

8
00:00:34.366 --> 00:00:35.200
madam madam

9
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.333
You just said that you were too tired to come back from the design museum.

10
00:00:37.333 --> 00:00:38.566
Went to the pantry to rest

11
00:00:38.566 --> 00:00:39.966
How is your rest now?

12
00:00:40.733 --> 00:00:42.666
No, I don't like sleeping on the sofa.

13
00:00:42.666 --> 00:00:43.666
I'm going home to rest.

14
00:00:44.733 --> 00:00:47.300
By the way, you are also very tired when you come back from the design museum

15
00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:48.200
Get off work now

16
00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:49.400
I'll give you a panorama

17
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:50.266
Oh, really?

18
00:00:50.266 --> 00:00:52.700
Thank you ma'am thank you ma'am I'll pack my things now

19
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.033
Thank you ma'am goodbye

20
00:00:56.066 --> 00:00:56.966
Goodbye madam

21
00:01:03.166 --> 00:01:05.933
Song Nan Ge's company has no one left

22
00:01:05.933 --> 00:01:07.466
Just wait to die

23
00:01:11.066 --> 00:01:12.366
Where did the smoke come from?

24
00:01:15.066 --> 00:01:17.866
Brother Song Nan, you know the smoke in the fire

25
00:01:17.866 --> 00:01:19.600
Many did not die by fire

26
00:01:21.266 --> 00:01:23.066
Zhao Yaru, I have no enmity with you

27
00:01:23.066 --> 00:01:24.300
Why do you care about me?

28
00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:25.566
Please let me out!

29
00:01:25.566 --> 00:01:26.966
I told you so.

30
00:01:26.966 --> 00:01:30.500
Brother Yanchen, I want to blame you for blocking my way

31
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.566
I have turned off the monitoring.

32
00:01:33.666 --> 00:01:35.100
Only you are dead

33
00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.266
Only then can I really get Brother Yanchen

34
00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.666
Hahaha, I open the door.
