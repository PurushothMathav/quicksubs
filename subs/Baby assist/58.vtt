1
00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:01.466
He's an impostor.

2
00:00:01.566 --> 00:00:03.000
I am the real president

3
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.466
Madam, what nonsense are you talking about?

4
00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:06.833
Brother Song Nan

5
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:09.700
You just said that your husband works under Brother Yanchen

6
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.033
Now he says your husband is Brother Yanchen

7
00:00:12.133 --> 00:00:14.100
How many truths are there in your mouth?

8
00:00:14.166 --> 00:00:16.600
If I had known earlier, I would not have allowed Yan Chen to leave just now

9
00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.500
Madam, ignore him

10
00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:20.966
I think he just wants to marry into a wealthy family and is crazy

11
00:00:20.966 --> 00:00:22.800
You can't tell reality from fantasy.

12
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.500
I mean it.

13
00:00:24.666 --> 00:00:26.233
Even if what you say is true

14
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.900
Why didn't you identify yourself when you joined yesterday?

15
00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:31.600
Also by this Gott to send electronic cards

16
00:00:31.933 --> 00:00:33.800
I came to the company to work

17
00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.200
Not to be a bodhisattva

18
00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.200
Zhou Yaru has been in the company for two days

19
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.333
You two

20
00:00:38.333 --> 00:00:41.066
Every day around his wife's wife

21
00:00:41.333 --> 00:00:42.466
Baixin Chat

22
00:00:42.466 --> 00:00:43.600
I didn't do any work.

23
00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:44.166
i

24
00:00:44.166 --> 00:00:46.400
Then why don't you hide your wife's identity now?

25
00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:47.900
Look at Yanchen's face

26
00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:50.066
I've given him a chance to come clean in private

27
00:00:50.066 --> 00:00:51.766
But since he used my name

28
00:00:51.766 --> 00:00:53.300
I want to discuss cooperation with Mr. Gu

29
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:54.900
As much as ruining my career

30
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.266
Of course I'm going to debunk him

31
00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:57.533
You are a bargain

32
00:00:57.533 --> 00:00:58.866
Totally out of hand

33
00:00:58.866 --> 00:01:00.800
Brother Xicheng won't marry you at all

34
00:01:00.866 --> 00:01:02.400
You don't believe me, do you?

35
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.400
Ok, I'll make a call.

36
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.600
It's really Brother Yan Cheng's phone number.

37
00:01:09.766 --> 00:01:11.700
Is he really Yan Cheng's wife?

38
00:01:11.766 --> 00:01:12.566
What do you do?

39
00:01:13.133 --> 00:01:16.300
Hello, the number you dialed is on the phone

40
00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:17.833
Please dial again later

41
00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:21.166
Yan Cheng is talking to someone else

42
00:01:21.166 --> 00:01:22.533
I'll call back in 10 minutes.

43
00:01:22.533 --> 00:01:23.800
You must have called him

44
00:01:23.966 --> 00:01:26.266
As soon as you call, it's on the phone

45
00:01:26.266 --> 00:01:27.400
What a coincidence

46
00:01:27.866 --> 00:01:29.766
You're not directing and acting, are you?

47
00:01:30.066 --> 00:01:32.700
Daddy, can my sister and I come back tonight?

48
00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.600
I want to eat Mommy's cooking

49
00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:36.466
Can't wait for 10 minutes

50
00:01:36.466 --> 00:01:37.966
You don't have 10 minutes?

51
00:01:37.966 --> 00:01:40.366
What if it's on the phone again in 10 minutes?

52
00:01:40.366 --> 00:01:42.566
We can't wait forever, can we?

53
00:01:42.566 --> 00:01:44.033
I'm not so unlucky

54
00:01:44.066 --> 00:01:45.966
Madam, please give Mr. Feng a call

55
00:01:45.966 --> 00:01:47.266
Let him come over.

56
00:01:47.333 --> 00:01:50.266
You saw it just now.

57
00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:51.600
See Brother Chen is busy

58
00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:52.600
Not to disturb

59
00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:53.333
madam

60
00:01:53.333 --> 00:01:56.266
We all know that you like Brother Song Nan's ability.

61
00:01:56.266 --> 00:01:59.400
But it's too much for him to keep you off the stage many times

62
00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.866
You call the lunatic and make it clear in person

63
00:02:01.866 --> 00:02:03.733
Just so he can put away his delusions

64
00:02:03.733 --> 00:02:05.000
Hum ok

65
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.133
You call him

66
00:02:06.133 --> 00:02:09.200
I'd like to see if he calls you wife

67
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.500
Why don't you dare to hit?

68
00:02:15.333 --> 00:02:17.200
What do Zhao Zhao and his sister want to eat tonight?

69
00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:18.900
I have something delivered to my house

70
00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.200
Then pick up Mommy early from get off work, okay?

71
00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.300
Ok daddy bye

72
00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:27.100
Zhou Yaru

73
00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.400
Why is he calling me again?

74
00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.000
How to pick it up

75
00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.266
Hello brother chen

76
00:02:34.666 --> 00:02:36.666
I'm having trouble at the design gallery.

77
00:02:36.866 --> 00:02:38.400
Can you come here for a moment?
