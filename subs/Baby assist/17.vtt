00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:01.233
How is that possible?

2
00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:03.500
He's clearly a stinky brick bearer

3
00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:05.800
Mr. Feng, I'm late

4
00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:07.000
Since you are here

5
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.866
Why don't you rush these two out?

6
00:00:08.933 --> 00:00:09.833
YES YES YES

7
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.133
Security kicked them out

8
00:00:12.133 --> 00:00:13.533
You are not allowed to set foot here in the future

9
00:00:13.533 --> 00:00:14.366
Wait a minute.

10
00:00:15.366 --> 00:00:17.466
Apologize to my two children before going out

11
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.200
Song Langao, you did it on purpose, right?

12
00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:21.900
I deliberately pretended to be poor before

13
00:00:21.966 --> 00:00:24.800
Now you say what kind of wind clan he is, you are kidding me

14
00:00:27.166 --> 00:00:29.966
How can we grant you a heart like this?

15
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.100
Give it a good lesson.

16
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:33.366
Then just throw it out

17
00:00:33.966 --> 00:00:36.166
I'm always sorry.

18
00:00:36.933 --> 00:00:37.900
I have no eyes

19
00:00:37.966 --> 00:00:39.300
It's my dog eyes that look down on people

20
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.800
I will never dare again

21
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.766
Please give me another chance

22
00:00:42.766 --> 00:00:43.566
Mr. Mo

23
00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.466
People like you who are tall and low and don't know the truth

24
00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.233
Match me to give you a chance

25
00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.100
Mr. Wu, you have been fired

26
00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.233
Let's go ok

27
00:01:01.066 --> 00:01:03.266
We found the surveillance of the Huangtian Club 5 years ago

28
00:01:03.266 --> 00:01:05.000
But the time interval is too long

29
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.133
Data is overwritten

30
00:01:06.133 --> 00:01:08.500
It will take a while to repair, continue to check

31
00:01:10.166 --> 00:01:12.833
Mr. Fang, what the hell is going on?

32
00:01:13.466 --> 00:01:16.000
Didn't you say you moved bricks?

33
00:01:16.533 --> 00:01:18.466
Why does Dean Wang call you Mr. Fang?

34
00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.100
This is a misunderstanding.

35
00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:23.700
Misunderstanding

36
00:01:24.666 --> 00:01:26.000
Ah, it's a misunderstanding

37
00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.066
Didn't I tell you before?

38
00:01:28.266 --> 00:01:30.500
This kindergarten is run by our boss.

39
00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:31.933
I helped him once before.

40
00:01:31.933 --> 00:01:33.266
That's why he let Dean Wang

41
00:01:33.266 --> 00:01:35.000
Cooperate with me to play a president's play

42
00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.166
Is that so?

43
00:01:37.166 --> 00:01:39.466
I say but

44
00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.500
This is also a hard lesson for Chen

45
00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:42.433
One meal in sedentary year

46
00:01:42.733 --> 00:01:43.533
It's worth it.

47
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.366
Then let's go back and have a good meal to celebrate

48
00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.366
Ok let's go

49
00:01:52.333 --> 00:01:53.866
It's actually acting

50
00:01:54.533 --> 00:01:57.833
How dare you play with me, you stinky brick mover

51
00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:02.433
Wait for me.
