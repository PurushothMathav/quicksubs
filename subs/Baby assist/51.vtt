00:00:00.666 --> 00:00:01.566
What do you mean?

2
00:00:01.766 --> 00:00:03.000
You are not madam

3
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.833
It's up to you to start today

4
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:07.833
You are not madam

5
00:00:08.133 --> 00:00:09.466
Is it you?

6
00:00:09.766 --> 00:00:11.833
Mr. Feng is the richest man in Haicheng

7
00:00:11.933 --> 00:00:14.566
Why doesn't the lady have a name tag on her?

8
00:00:14.566 --> 00:00:16.766
I don't like extravagance. Waste is fine

9
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.600
Shut up, I'm Brother Yan Cheng's wife

10
00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:20.900
You don't believe me, do you?

11
00:00:20.933 --> 00:00:22.566
I'll call him now.

12
00:00:23.133 --> 00:00:24.433
Hello Yan Cheng

13
00:00:24.533 --> 00:00:25.766
I don't think so.

14
00:00:31.533 --> 00:00:32.766
Can you find me?

15
00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.500
I met Mr. Feng at the annual meeting

16
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:35.866
It's really the sound of the wind

17
00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:37.733
So I heard.

18
00:00:37.733 --> 00:00:39.866
You have a design pavilion with a German Design Gold Award

19
00:00:39.866 --> 00:00:41.366
Did I study interior design?

20
00:00:41.366 --> 00:00:42.766
I want to find inspiration

21
00:00:42.766 --> 00:00:44.133
Where does the electronic card live in Gott?

22
00:00:44.133 --> 00:00:45.166
Are you looking for him?

23
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.466
Do I want you to bring it to me?

24
00:00:47.466 --> 00:00:48.966
Oh the wind always comes

25
00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:51.500
I have to work

26
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.966
If you don't give it to me, I'll tell grandma

27
00:00:53.966 --> 00:00:55.300
Grandma loves me

28
00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.366
Grandma said she would treat me as her own granddaughter

29
00:00:59.266 --> 00:01:01.500
Grandma is old, don't bother him

30
00:01:01.533 --> 00:01:03.533
Where are you? I'll ask Master Gott to send it to you.

31
00:01:03.533 --> 00:01:04.633
I want you to send

32
00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:06.566
Don't forget it.

33
00:01:07.266 --> 00:01:09.633
Forget it, just Gotter

34
00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.866
Brother Yan Cheng still has work to do

35
00:01:13.066 --> 00:01:15.300
He asked Lord Gott to send it to me in a while

36
00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.033
Gott is the celebrity around Mr. Feng

37
00:01:18.366 --> 00:01:20.433
Only the wind can always call him

38
00:01:20.766 --> 00:01:24.166
Madam, we shouldn't question your identity

39
00:01:28.266 --> 00:01:29.800
Assistant Gott is here

40
00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.066
I'm going to get the electronic card

41
00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:33.366
Mr. Gott wouldn't call you madam
