1
00:00:00.066 --> 00:00:02.333
You ruin something in our store or lose money.

2
00:00:02.333 --> 00:00:03.600
Or buy it

3
00:00:03.666 --> 00:00:04.800
Otherwise you don't want to run

4
00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.133
You just saw it.

5
00:00:06.133 --> 00:00:08.000
You threw the takeout on the jade bracelet

6
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.166
Just fell out

7
00:00:09.166 --> 00:00:10.433
Anyone?

8
00:00:11.066 --> 00:00:12.466
Did you see it?

9
00:00:13.166 --> 00:00:15.000
No one saw it

10
00:00:15.266 --> 00:00:16.833
This jade bracelet 500,000

11
00:00:16.933 --> 00:00:18.166
See how you pay

12
00:00:18.166 --> 00:00:20.533
Does he have that much money as a delivery guy?

13
00:00:20.533 --> 00:00:22.766
If you don't have so much money, let your family collect it

14
00:00:22.933 --> 00:00:25.266
Anyway, you have to be responsible for destroying our jade bracelet.

15
00:00:25.666 --> 00:00:28.766
What about your phone? Take it out and call me. Let me go

16
00:00:30.766 --> 00:00:31.800
How come?

17
00:00:31.866 --> 00:00:33.300
It should be a shopping problem.

18
00:00:33.566 --> 00:00:35.333
Today was an accident

19
00:00:35.333 --> 00:00:36.466
It's alright usually

20
00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:39.433
Wife

21
00:00:39.566 --> 00:00:40.733
Find someone to deal with it quickly

22
00:00:40.733 --> 00:00:42.066
Don't affect the market

23
00:00:42.066 --> 00:00:43.900
It has affected me. Come here

24
00:00:47.133 --> 00:00:48.200
Understood, I'll send it to you.

25
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:49.933
This has nothing to do with me

26
00:00:49.933 --> 00:00:51.833
I still want to send the next order.

27
00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.733
Still thinking of delivering takeout?

28
00:00:53.733 --> 00:00:55.366
If it weren't for this takeout you delivered

29
00:00:55.366 --> 00:00:56.900
Can this happen?

30
00:00:57.333 --> 00:00:59.100
Take your takeout

31
00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.033
Our jade master will also accompany us

32
00:01:02.133 --> 00:01:03.400
Don't go too far

33
00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:05.166
How things are going, everyone knows

34
00:01:05.166 --> 00:01:07.366
And there are surveillance cameras in the store

35
00:01:07.766 --> 00:01:10.066
Otherwise, I'll call the police over to retrieve the surveillance

36
00:01:10.066 --> 00:01:11.666
See who is responsible

37
00:01:11.666 --> 00:01:13.433
You still want to threaten me

38
00:01:13.733 --> 00:01:16.666
Believe it or not, I won't let you out of this store today.

39
00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:18.900
So brave
