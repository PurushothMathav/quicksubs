00:00:08.333 --> 00:00:11.300
Why don't you make a love bento and thank you?

4
00:00:18.133 --> 00:00:19.400
Here are three options

5
00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:22.300

The meeting is adjourned

15
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:50.500
Why did the meeting end?

16
00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.600
This kind of meeting, oops, forget it, what's going on?

17
00:00:54.066 --> 00:00:55.466
Teacher Tao, wait a minute

Thank you.

23
00:01:07.966 --> 00:01:11.633
Isn't this watch the one in the Patek Philippe advertisement?

24
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.666
I made millions.

25
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.766
Oops, forgot to take it.

26
00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:18.200
This is fake.

27
00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:20.700
Men love face more

28
00:01:21.266 --> 00:01:22.233
Ah!

29
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.500
Are your shoes genuine leather?

30
00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:28.766

31
00:01:29.366 --> 00:01:31.633
This is also fake. 99 yuan free shipping.

32
00:01:32.266 --> 00:01:33.966
This year's

33
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.500
The replicas are getting better and better.

34
00:01:38.666 --> 00:01:41.100
It's okay to keep it.

35
00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.300
Almost left

36
00:01:42.466 --> 00:01:45.400
But we don't usually use these things

37
00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:46.800
You go to work even more

38
00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:47.966
How about this?

39
00:01:47.966 --> 00:01:50.266
Well, to prevent you from spending money indiscriminately.

40
00:01:50.266 --> 00:01:51.866
I'll keep the salary card for you.

41
00:01:52.466 --> 00:01:54.700
Salary card uh oh

42
00:02:00.366 --> 00:02:01.466
Let me take this.

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.200
Hello, Song Zhaozhao's mother?

44
00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.200
Song Zhaozhao got into a fight with a child at school

45
00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.366
Is it convenient to come over?

46
00:02:08.366 --> 00:02:09.766
Ah, I'll be right there

47
00:02:10.533 --> 00:02:11.733
Something happened to Zhao Zhao at school

48
00:02:11.733 --> 00:02:13.700
I have to go quickly. I'm leaving first.

49
00:02:17.533 --> 00:02:19.833
Chaochao doesn't look like he will fight with people casually

50
00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.400
Nothing will happen, I'll go and see
