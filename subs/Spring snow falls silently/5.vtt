00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:10.366
The stinky girls are going to nag again

2
00:00:10.666 --> 00:00:12.400
I will put out the fire and kill you

3
00:00:25.566 --> 00:00:26.866
Should I pay back the money?

4
00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:29.433
100,000 with interest

5
00:00:31.666 --> 00:00:34.966
Brother Tao, didn't we say 7 days?

6
00:00:34.966 --> 00:00:36.766
Isn't it time yet?

7
00:00:38.733 --> 00:00:40.800
Now you owe me money

8
00:00:41.166 --> 00:00:42.666
When will I return it?

9
00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:44.033
When the hell will it be returned?

10
00:00:44.766 --> 00:00:46.833
This dog thing that kills a thousand knives

11
00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.466
Haha, big brother.

12
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.300
I lost again recently.

13
00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.200
You really have no money, you can observe me for a few more days.

14
00:00:54.933 --> 00:00:56.133
What do you mean?

15
00:00:56.133 --> 00:00:58.633
Are you trying to trick me into procrastinating?

16
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:00.666
No, not really.

17
00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:01.566
Wait a minute.

18
00:01:02.266 --> 00:01:03.366
The house was smashed for me.

19
00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:05.500
All valuables were taken away

20
00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:06.533
Got it, oh big brother

21
00:01:06.533 --> 00:01:06.900
Oh, dear.

22
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.200
Can't smash, can't smash, can't smash, can't smash

23
00:01:10.333 --> 00:01:11.566
Can't smash my house

24
00:01:11.566 --> 00:01:13.633
You owe me a few more days

25
00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:17.566
No money, right?

26
00:01:17.733 --> 00:01:19.266
Let me give you an idea.

27
00:01:19.566 --> 00:01:22.500
Your girl is pretty

28
00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.266
Let her sleep with me for one night

29
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.466
I'll give you a few days off, hahaha, so fierce.

30
00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:31.966
Brother Tao is just a little drama with his sister?

31
00:01:31.966 --> 00:01:34.666
Yeah, our family is counting on him

32
00:01:34.933 --> 00:01:37.600
Please raise your hand and let him go

33
00:01:37.666 --> 00:01:39.666
He's getting married soon

34
00:01:40.166 --> 00:01:43.000
Did I beg you to forgive me?

35
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:43.866
shut up

36
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.366
Or pay back

37
00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:47.700
Or talk to me

38
00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.166
Hahahahaha

39
00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:51.600
Ah!

40
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:52.800
Ah!

41
00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:57.600
Hahaha, please save me!

42
00:02:00.666 --> 00:02:01.466
Let's go

43
00:02:02.466 --> 00:02:03.566
Go go go

44
00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:09.700
Big brother and daughter-in-law are in good shape

45
00:02:10.666 --> 00:02:12.100
Get angry and serve

46
00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:13.166
Give you a break
