00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:04.800
Sir and madam are not well

2
00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:07.633
What did the old lady run away again?

3
00:00:10.466 --> 00:00:12.333
Madam, you can't go. Madam, you can't go

4
00:00:12.333 --> 00:00:14.500
You can't go oops oops what are you doing

5
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:15.800
Let go of me!

6
00:00:16.533 --> 00:00:17.633
How come?

7
00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.066
Madam, he's running away from home again

8
00:00:20.066 --> 00:00:21.433
You stop talking nonsense

9
00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.566
This is not my home

10
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:24.766
I'm going to find my daughter.

11
00:00:24.766 --> 00:00:26.033
Oh, Mom.

12
00:00:26.533 --> 00:00:28.866
Since the old lady had a car accident a year ago

13
00:00:28.866 --> 00:00:29.800
Had surgery

14
00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.566
Can't remember anything

15
00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:33.700
Even if Jacqui is cured

16
00:00:33.766 --> 00:00:35.733
Still clamoring to leave every day

17
00:00:35.733 --> 00:00:37.500
I don't know ma'am

18
00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:40.400
When will I meet the old lady?

19
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.400
Mom will remember

20
00:00:46.333 --> 00:00:48.766
I'm your daughter, Jay

21
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.366
Don't lie to me.

22
00:00:52.333 --> 00:00:53.500
My daughter Xiaojie

23
00:00:54.333 --> 00:00:56.700
So tall and better looking than you

24
00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.100
I'm going home to find my daughter

25
00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:00.800
She's still at home waiting for me

26
00:01:01.066 --> 00:01:01.866
busy

27
00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.000
Ouch, why do you always stop me?

28
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.800
I told you I'm going back to find my daughter

29
00:01:08.133 --> 00:01:09.000
OK

30
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.766
It's cold and we can't fight at night

31
00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:16.800
Why are you crying?

32
00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:19.566
Your mother is gone

33
00:01:20.533 --> 00:01:22.400
Whoops whoops whoops

34
00:01:22.466 --> 00:01:24.033
Don't cry, don't cry

35
00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:25.500
That would be like

36
00:01:25.766 --> 00:01:27.066
I'll help you find your mother.

37
00:01:27.066 --> 00:01:29.300
Please help me find my daughter

38
00:01:33.133 --> 00:01:34.433

39
00:01:38.133 --> 00:01:40.500

40
00:01:44.066 --> 00:01:46.000
