00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.166
It's all you, it's all you who broke my good deeds

2
00:00:02.166 --> 00:00:03.733
Why are you a lowly

3
00:00:03.733 --> 00:00:05.266
If you raise it, you will have such a good life

4
00:00:05.266 --> 00:00:07.133
The richest man in Jiangcheng is your daughter

5
00:00:07.133 --> 00:00:09.300
You have unimaginable glory and wealth

6
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.333
And I can only live in Xiaozao Village

7
00:00:12.333 --> 00:00:14.700
When a widow is bought and married

8
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.300
Why do you have any resentment?

9
00:00:17.733 --> 00:00:19.100
All coming at me

10
00:00:19.966 --> 00:00:21.300
It has nothing to do with him.

11
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:22.200
fart

12
00:00:22.266 --> 00:00:24.566
If he hadn't been blind and couldn't recognize his mother

13
00:00:24.566 --> 00:00:25.466
How can there be so much?

14
00:00:25.466 --> 00:00:27.066
Let go of you let go of me

15
00:00:27.066 --> 00:00:29.500
Don't move, I'll kill you now

16
00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:30.433
No.

17
00:00:31.066 --> 00:00:33.533
Shen Guiying, do you think you borrowed the window ring?

18
00:00:33.533 --> 00:00:34.966
You can have a mother-daughter reunion

19
00:00:34.966 --> 00:00:36.400
All is well

20
00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.633
Now your daughter is in my hands

21
00:00:38.733 --> 00:00:40.033
Want to save him

22
00:00:40.333 --> 00:00:43.900
You can trade one life for another.

23
00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:46.566
Not as long as you die for him

24
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.633
I'll let him go

25
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.766
Don't you love your daughter very much?

26
00:00:50.766 --> 00:00:52.266
I'm going to check it out today

27
00:00:52.266 --> 00:00:54.500
Would you risk your life for him?

28
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:55.566
Mom don't

29
00:00:55.566 --> 00:00:58.633
No, as long as you don't hurt my daughter.

30
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.033
I would.
