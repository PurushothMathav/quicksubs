00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:03.966
Hello

2
00:00:05.066 --> 00:00:06.033
What do you want?

3
00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:11.700
This is a prescription, packed in two packs according to the dose above.

4
00:00:15.466 --> 00:00:16.933
Do you want to make particles?

5
00:00:16.933 --> 00:00:18.800
Or pack it up and go home by yourself?

6
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.400
Anyway, both of these will cost 500 yuan in labor costs.

7
00:00:21.733 --> 00:00:23.500
Just follow the recipe above for the amount of ingredients.

8
00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:25.233
I go home and hum to myself

9
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.800
In order to save 500 yuan, I went home to boil it myself

10
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.366
You know how to dispense medicine.

11
00:00:30.666 --> 00:00:33.000
Brother, why don't you make any particles?

12
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.633
I don't know anything about dispensing medicine

13
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.300
It's alright, I know it's alright

14
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.600
This traditional Chinese medicine mainly relies on suffering to get out of the drug risk

15
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.966
And it can't be evenly divided according to the dose of the drug

16
00:00:44.966 --> 00:00:48.300
Oh, anyway, don't worry about it, I'll do it myself

17
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.000
If you have no money, you have no money, what kind of recipe are you talking about?

18
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.366
That's funny.

19
00:00:53.133 --> 00:00:55.033
The car is ready 40,000 five

20
00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.866
How much 40,000 five

21
00:00:57.866 --> 00:00:58.766
Do you understand?

22
00:00:58.766 --> 00:00:59.566
poor

23
00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.466
This is still 10% off for activities in our store.

24
00:01:02.466 --> 00:01:05.300
Otherwise, these pills cost 50,000

25
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.600
No, this is how much it weighs.

26
00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.166
40,000 five we don't want

27
00:01:09.166 --> 00:01:10.466
Don't buy it if you can't afford it.

28
00:01:10.466 --> 00:01:11.566
I knew you had no money

29
00:01:11.566 --> 00:01:13.333
I won't waste time getting you medicine

30
00:01:13.333 --> 00:01:15.066
Go go go to your brother

31
00:01:15.533 --> 00:01:17.866
My sister doesn't understand the one you came back to.

32
00:01:17.866 --> 00:01:18.666
Excuse me.

33
00:01:19.133 --> 00:01:20.500
I'm out of this medicine

34
00:01:21.766 --> 00:01:23.866
I sweep you or you sweep me I sweep you

35
00:01:25.466 --> 00:01:27.766
Okay, the payment is successful.

36
00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:32.466
Look no further.

37
00:01:32.466 --> 00:01:35.333
Anyway, you don't understand it, just take it home and boil it.

38
00:01:35.333 --> 00:01:36.133
This medicine

39
00:01:36.566 --> 00:01:37.600
Right?
