1
00:00:00.733 --> 00:00:02.666
July is really used by Qianlong

2
00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:03.500
You see

3
00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:06.900
The music hall above also seems to love bamboo acupoint and feel guilty

4
00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:10.366
What is Qianlong's royal sewing box?

5
00:00:10.366 --> 00:00:11.766
How is that possible?

6
00:00:13.466 --> 00:00:16.433
Qian Lang, this can't be true, can it?

7
00:00:18.133 --> 00:00:19.933
Oh this old gentleman

8
00:00:19.933 --> 00:00:21.000
Look again.

9
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.766
I've seen this before.

10
00:00:22.766 --> 00:00:26.133
It's a box where he keeps needles and thread in his house.

11
00:00:26.133 --> 00:00:27.500
He is a poor man

12
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:28.600
No background.

13
00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.300
How can there be antiques?

14
00:00:30.466 --> 00:00:32.333
And the money always said

15
00:00:32.333 --> 00:00:34.300
This is a modern imitation

16
00:00:34.366 --> 00:00:36.666
Maybe it's a copy of the one you said.

17
00:00:36.666 --> 00:00:39.466
What Qianlong's payment seal?

18
00:00:39.533 --> 00:00:43.500
Oh, the surnamed Xian said that this is impulsive.

19
00:00:43.866 --> 00:00:45.200
Hey me

20
00:00:45.466 --> 00:00:48.066
I'm not very good at Ming and Qing things

21
00:00:48.066 --> 00:00:50.866
I analyze that seal, it may be fake.

22
00:00:50.966 --> 00:00:52.066
Humph colorful lights

23
00:00:52.566 --> 00:00:54.333
Are you insulting my intelligence?

24
00:00:54.333 --> 00:00:55.533
This this this

25
00:00:55.533 --> 00:00:58.066
Seals from ancient history are carved

26
00:00:58.066 --> 00:01:00.966
The angles of the wood cracking cannot be the same

27
00:01:01.166 --> 00:01:03.066
This is the hardest thing to copy

28
00:01:03.166 --> 00:01:04.400
Do our job

29
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:05.933
This is basic common sense

30
00:01:05.933 --> 00:01:08.366
Can't you even tell if a camel is real or fake?

31
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:12.800
Mr. Xu, do you mean that he forced buying and selling

32
00:01:12.933 --> 00:01:15.266
Or he just doesn't understand shit

33
00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:17.866
Or he's just lying with his eyes open

34
00:01:18.133 --> 00:01:19.366
These boxes

35
00:01:19.566 --> 00:01:21.866
It's a genuine Qianlong imperial possession

36
00:01:21.866 --> 00:01:24.900
What else does Qian Ru have to say?
