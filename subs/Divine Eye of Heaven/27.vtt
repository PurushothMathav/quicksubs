00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.833
Good master

2
00:00:01.933 --> 00:00:04.266
You guys are just ganging up on me, right?

3
00:00:04.266 --> 00:00:06.466
Oh what a joke

4
00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:08.700
What reputation do I have in this circle?

5
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.366
Is that really necessary?

6
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.166
Yang Min, you don't deny it, do you?

7
00:00:13.166 --> 00:00:16.033
The words of the mouth have arrived

8
00:00:16.133 --> 00:00:17.800
If you dare not

9
00:00:18.066 --> 00:00:20.233
Can I ask someone else to help you?

10
00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:21.366
What lady

11
00:00:21.366 --> 00:00:22.900
Let me help him.

12
00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:31.366
Help him eat

13
00:00:31.466 --> 00:00:34.466
Stinky dick just told you to get out, but you don't get out

14
00:00:34.466 --> 00:00:36.166
Now you be obedient

15
00:00:36.166 --> 00:00:38.666
Eat these broken pieces of glass for me

16
00:00:38.666 --> 00:00:40.166
Then as agreed

17
00:00:40.166 --> 00:00:42.766
The dog barked and crawled out of here

18
00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:44.966
Collude with the instrument to mess with me

19
00:00:44.966 --> 00:00:46.733
If you have the ability, let's find an outside expert

20
00:00:46.733 --> 00:00:49.166
Let's see if this thing is an old object.

21
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.866
Che Qian Lao is an expert in this antique street

22
00:00:52.866 --> 00:00:54.566
He could be wrong.

23
00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.933
Don't you just want to admit it?

24
00:00:56.933 --> 00:01:00.566
You can skip this glass.

25
00:01:01.333 --> 00:01:04.533
As long as you get under my crotch

26
00:01:04.533 --> 00:01:06.400
And climb into the street

27
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.300
Learn to bark for an hour

28
00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:10.100
I'll let you go

29
00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.466
Stinky dick, don't hurry up and kneel down

30
00:01:13.466 --> 00:01:15.966
Thank you Miss Wu for your kindness

31
00:01:16.533 --> 00:01:20.166
It's better to bark like a dog than to wear a rotten belly

32
00:01:20.533 --> 00:01:22.666
Okay, what are you doing?

33
00:01:22.666 --> 00:01:24.200
We're all civilized people.

34
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.133
Don't be so vulgar

35
00:01:26.133 --> 00:01:27.033
So be it.

36
00:01:27.166 --> 00:01:29.833
I bought this sewing box for 10 bucks

37
00:01:29.866 --> 00:01:31.533
It's no more than 10 yuan.

38
00:01:31.533 --> 00:01:34.966
Miss Wu, it's not less than 10 yuan for me to go down the steps.

39
00:01:34.966 --> 00:01:36.866
Your agreement with Miss Wu?

40
00:01:36.866 --> 00:01:39.100
Forget it, what do you think?

41
00:01:39.366 --> 00:01:41.233
Hum Yang Min

42
00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.100
Now money always makes peace

43
00:01:43.333 --> 00:01:44.900
I don't care about you

44
00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.100
Money old boy

45
00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:49.266
For this thing

46
00:01:49.266 --> 00:01:52.400
There is no need to borrow blood and spend 10 yuan to buy the lesson

47
00:01:52.666 --> 00:01:54.000
Is it worth it?

48
00:01:54.766 --> 00:01:56.000
Oh, I see.

49
00:01:56.066 --> 00:01:59.100
Did you get the idea for this sewing box?
