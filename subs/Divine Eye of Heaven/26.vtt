1
00:00:03.066 --> 00:00:06.000
No, is this thing really a treasure?

2
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.766
How is Qian Lao?

3
00:00:08.766 --> 00:00:10.400
How much is this thing worth?

4
00:00:11.766 --> 00:00:15.433
Judging from the old man's 30 years of treasure appraisal experience

5
00:00:15.533 --> 00:00:17.500
This sewing box

6
00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.700
He's just an ordinary sewing box

7
00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:21.766
Take it to the second-hand market to sell it.

8
00:00:21.766 --> 00:00:24.100
It's only 5 yuan at most.

9
00:00:24.533 --> 00:00:25.766
Do you hear me?

10
00:00:25.766 --> 00:00:28.600
I just overestimated and gave you 10 yuan.

11
00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:31.033
This thing isn't even worth 5 bucks

12
00:00:32.333 --> 00:00:33.433
This gentleman

13
00:00:33.466 --> 00:00:35.866
Are you sure you don't want to take a good look anymore?

14
00:00:36.866 --> 00:00:39.966
The old man has not seen it for more than ten years

15
00:00:39.966 --> 00:00:44.300
I'm sure this thing is 5 bucks fast

16
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:45.300
All right.

17
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.400
You go outside now and find me the same one.

18
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:47.933
5 bucks.

19
00:00:47.933 --> 00:00:50.100
I'm about to open my eyes to these boxes

20
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.200
Young man, don't get too excited

21
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.666
I understand how you feel now.

22
00:00:54.866 --> 00:00:56.333
How many people come here?

23
00:00:56.333 --> 00:00:59.400
They all think their stuff is an antique treasure

24
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.666
But basically 99% of people

25
00:01:01.666 --> 00:01:04.000
They're modern imitations.

26
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.833
It's industrial waste.

27
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.866
I see your thing

28
00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:10.233
This good product is still poor

29
00:01:10.333 --> 00:01:11.633
Do you hear me?

30
00:01:11.666 --> 00:01:13.533
It's not just a modern copy

31
00:01:13.533 --> 00:01:15.266
Or industrial waste?

32
00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.600
Come on, show the money

33
00:01:21.666 --> 00:01:23.066
Let's take a look too

34
00:01:23.066 --> 00:01:25.866
How did people put this glass?

35
00:01:25.933 --> 00:01:28.300
Eat it young man

36
00:01:28.666 --> 00:01:31.166
Keep your word
