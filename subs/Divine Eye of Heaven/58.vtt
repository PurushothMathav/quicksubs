00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:19.300
Okay, it's 10:03.

2
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.500
We'll wait for him for 10 minutes

3
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:23.466
10 minutes to

4
00:00:23.866 --> 00:00:26.400
How is it? Is there a problem?

5
00:00:27.166 --> 00:00:30.733
I don't feel this broken ginseng.

6
00:00:30.733 --> 00:00:32.600
It's like a radish

7
00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.866
It's not as good as the ginseng opened by that traditional Chinese medicine room

8
00:00:34.866 --> 00:00:36.100
Piece

9
00:00:38.266 --> 00:00:39.833
My 300,000

10
00:00:40.566 --> 00:00:42.000
Brushed mink

11
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.400
300,000 300,000 want to buy the 100-year Night God's Comedy

12
00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:47.166
dean

13
00:00:47.166 --> 00:00:49.666
You are at least a well-known professor in our country.

14
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.300
You have a brain

15
00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:55.966
Raise you

16
00:00:55.966 --> 00:00:58.666
Why do you dislike what the dean gave you?

17
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.366
It took 300,000 to buy it

18
00:01:01.466 --> 00:01:02.900
Although not evidence

19
00:01:02.966 --> 00:01:05.133
But at least they are sincere enough

20
00:01:05.133 --> 00:01:06.966
How about you?

21
00:01:06.966 --> 00:01:08.700
This guy doesn't actually have a barrel of a gun on his back.

22
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.166
Buy something for me armed girl

23
00:01:11.733 --> 00:01:13.200
That's a shame

24
00:01:13.533 --> 00:01:16.966
The birthday gift I give will naturally not last longer than the wish.

25
00:01:16.966 --> 00:01:18.566
Don't worry.

26
00:01:18.566 --> 00:01:21.566
Hey, more than just brother, you were kidding me yesterday

27
00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:22.700
I told you

28
00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.200
You definitely can't spend 500 yuan on a birthday gift

29
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.266
Come as a gift

30
00:01:26.266 --> 00:01:28.566
Yes, bring me your key.

31
00:01:28.566 --> 00:01:30.500
My brother has to be embarrassed by the rain too

32
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.400
That's right, what I give is a gift.
