00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:01.000
You can't drink it.

2
00:00:03.466 --> 00:00:04.533
Brother, what are you doing?

3
00:00:04.533 --> 00:00:08.000
It's for mom, not mom, I really can't drink him

4
00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:09.400
You can't drink it, you drink it

5
00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:12.033
It's not me, Xiaoxue

6
00:00:12.066 --> 00:00:14.166
Your brother has loved chicken soup since he was a child

7
00:00:14.466 --> 00:00:15.500
Just give him a drink

8
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.066
No, the doctor said it all

9
00:00:18.066 --> 00:00:19.266
Surgery is still being scheduled

10
00:00:19.266 --> 00:00:21.200
You have to eat something good to nourish your body

11
00:00:22.333 --> 00:00:23.466
Did you hear that?

12
00:00:23.466 --> 00:00:24.600
The doctor said it all

13
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:25.733
Mom is getting older now

14
00:00:25.733 --> 00:00:27.333
You have to eat something good to replenish your body

15
00:00:27.333 --> 00:00:28.666
It's not time to be on the operating table

16
00:00:28.666 --> 00:00:29.500
He will be in danger

17
00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:30.333
Do you hear me?

18
00:00:30.333 --> 00:00:31.166
I mean it.

19
00:00:31.166 --> 00:00:33.333
Mom really can't drink now, he'll have an accident

20
00:00:33.333 --> 00:00:34.333
It's okay. It's okay.

21
00:00:34.333 --> 00:00:36.466
Son, drink it

22
00:00:36.666 --> 00:00:37.366
Your sister?

23
00:00:37.366 --> 00:00:38.500
Stayed up all night

24
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.966
But busy, that's not what I meant

25
00:00:40.966 --> 00:00:44.766
You really don't want this soup. If you drink it, something will happen.

26
00:00:44.766 --> 00:00:46.533
You are really a dutiful son

27
00:00:46.533 --> 00:00:47.700
This is a hospital.

28
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.700
Who would come here if they weren't sick?

29
00:00:49.866 --> 00:00:51.800
You don't want to drink this chicken soup yourself, do you?

30
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.566
Ah, my belly is so big

31
00:00:53.566 --> 00:00:55.900
Mom, don't worry if we drink or eat

32
00:01:02.066 --> 00:01:02.933
Take another sip.

33
00:01:02.933 --> 00:01:05.100
Okay, okay, mom's full

34
00:01:05.166 --> 00:01:07.400
Give the rest to your brother to drink

35
00:01:09.166 --> 00:01:10.500
What's the use of giving it to me now?

36
00:01:10.933 --> 00:01:12.766
Doctor, nurse, come here
