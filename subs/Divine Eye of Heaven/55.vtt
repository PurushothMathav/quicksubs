00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:03.466
Fart this century-old wild mountain is my trust

2
00:00:03.466 --> 00:00:05.100
Friend found it himself

3
00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:07.566
I also have a video as proof.

4
00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:10.466
Stop talking nonsense here

5
00:00:10.466 --> 00:00:12.400
This video is obviously staged.

6
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:13.766
If anyone believes that

7
00:00:13.766 --> 00:00:17.000
That sow can even climb trees, hahahaha.

8
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.200
You fart, it's fake too

9
00:00:20.266 --> 00:00:21.566
That's fake too

10
00:00:22.133 --> 00:00:23.966
No matter what you find today

11
00:00:23.966 --> 00:00:25.600
You have to say it's fake.

12
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.466
Okay, the full length is in your hands.

13
00:00:28.466 --> 00:00:30.500
It doesn't matter if there is evidence

14
00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:31.666
What are you talking about?

15
00:00:31.766 --> 00:00:32.566
Mingming

16
00:00:33.366 --> 00:00:35.400
I see you're here to make trouble

17
00:00:36.266 --> 00:00:38.866
Miss Hou, do you want such a person?

18
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.766
Ruin the old man's birthday party?

19
00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.933
Somebody beat this mess out

20
00:00:44.933 --> 00:00:46.366
Wait a minute brown

21
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.533
The CEO Xu beside me has unique requirements for medicinal materials

22
00:00:50.533 --> 00:00:52.500
Is it a century-old wild ginseng?

23
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.033
He looks at you

24
00:00:54.533 --> 00:00:56.766
In the past two years, in the field of Chinese herbal medicine and antiques

25
00:00:56.766 --> 00:00:58.600
Master Xu, who is quite prestigious

26
00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:00.633
I flatter you.

27
00:01:00.766 --> 00:01:02.800
It's just a long time in the auction house

28
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:03.766
See the significance

29
00:01:03.766 --> 00:01:05.233
Since you are Master Xu

30
00:01:05.533 --> 00:01:07.600
Then please come and identify it.

31
00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.233
According to this course

32
00:01:11.666 --> 00:01:13.366
It's really been a few years.

33
00:01:14.366 --> 00:01:16.533
Did Yang Min hear that?

34
00:01:16.533 --> 00:01:18.600
Hey, what's the hurry?

35
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.000
I'm not finished yet.

36
00:01:20.666 --> 00:01:22.033
What about this thing?

37
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.100
Definitely not something wild
