00:00:00.466 --> 00:00:04.366
Doctor, my nurse is coming soon, what's wrong with the patient?

2
00:00:04.366 --> 00:00:05.366
Sorry, sorry.

3
00:00:05.366 --> 00:00:06.933
My brother didn't do this before

4
00:00:06.933 --> 00:00:08.333
He's a bit of that today

5
00:00:08.333 --> 00:00:09.900
I have to say my mom can't drink that soup

6
00:00:09.933 --> 00:00:11.766
Hey, forget it, didn't I say it before?

7
00:00:11.766 --> 00:00:13.000
Patients can drink soup

8
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.466
You can even eat some hard foods in small amounts

9
00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.233
How much you do affects our work?

10
00:00:17.366 --> 00:00:17.700
And

11
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:19.933
Don't think you read a few broken books on the stall

12
00:00:19.933 --> 00:00:21.200
I thought I was a great doctor

13
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.700
How will it affect our work if you do this?

14
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.100
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

15
00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:26.400
This chicken soup has wolfberry in it

16
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.000
My mom will be in trouble if she drinks it

17
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:28.500
Hahaha

18
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.366
Are you a doctor or am I a doctor?

19
00:00:32.066 --> 00:00:33.433
Look at your outfit

20
00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.266
Migrant workers in the open space

21
00:00:35.266 --> 00:00:36.800
Move bricks maybe I'll listen to you

22
00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:37.866
But what is this place?

23
00:00:37.866 --> 00:00:39.366
This is a hospital.

24
00:00:39.366 --> 00:00:41.000
Why do you command me?

25
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.566
Some People

26
00:00:41.566 --> 00:00:43.933
I thought I watched some videos and books online

27
00:00:43.933 --> 00:00:46.166
I feel like I can heal and save people

28
00:00:46.166 --> 00:00:48.666
But I don't know that this is harming others

29
00:00:48.666 --> 00:00:51.000
Miss Hou, what you said is

30
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.366
Is Mr. Hou okay in the hospital?

31
00:00:53.366 --> 00:00:54.266
How are you doing?

32
00:00:54.266 --> 00:00:55.900
Mr. Li has worked hard

33
00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:58.200
It feels good, Mr. Hou, you are welcome.

34
00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:58.966
People like me

35
00:00:58.966 --> 00:01:00.666
To be able to talk to Mr. Hou like this

36
00:01:00.666 --> 00:01:01.966
Learned people chat

37
00:01:01.966 --> 00:01:04.600
It really increased his own cultivation and knowledge

38
00:01:04.766 --> 00:01:07.566
Hey, dean, are you really such a migrant worker family?

39
00:01:07.566 --> 00:01:10.100
The same ward as Mr. Monkey

40
00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:11.833
I have to report to the dean later

41
00:01:11.933 --> 00:01:13.333
Can't let such a vulgar person

42
00:01:13.333 --> 00:01:15.133
Delay the repair I wrote to you

43
00:01:15.133 --> 00:01:17.066
No. What do you mean by that?

44
00:01:17.066 --> 00:01:19.466
Besides, this house is not us

45
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.066
Hey, stop talking, mom, mom, mom

46
00:01:23.333 --> 00:01:25.300
You are really good at medicine
