1
00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:02.500
We're going to go with auction houses.

2
00:00:02.733 --> 00:00:04.966
How is it? I'm fine.

3
00:00:05.533 --> 00:00:07.566
But some people

4
00:00:07.966 --> 00:00:09.566
I'm afraid I can't make any bets

5
00:00:09.566 --> 00:00:11.600
The discount for hiring Master Yang

6
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:13.300
If Master Yang and I lose

7
00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:15.333
I'm the auction house of Goldman Sachs.

8
00:00:15.333 --> 00:00:17.500
And my antique shop is different

9
00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.200
But if you lose

10
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:23.266
The auction house is mine

11
00:00:23.866 --> 00:00:27.100
Looks like I'm not just going to get an antique shop today

12
00:00:27.133 --> 00:00:28.800
And an auction house

13
00:00:29.066 --> 00:00:31.633
And get someone's eyeballs

14
00:00:32.333 --> 00:00:33.666
Don't talk too soon

15
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.300
Today is over

16
00:00:35.333 --> 00:00:39.500
I'm afraid your mother's auction house should take action

17
00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:40.300
Mr. Sheng

18
00:00:41.066 --> 00:00:42.700
After you.

19
00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:44.300
Come

20
00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:51.200
malachite

21
00:00:51.866 --> 00:00:53.433
Malachite this is

22
00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.900
Malachite bigger than an egg?

23
00:00:59.366 --> 00:01:00.300
You're wrong.

24
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.833
It's not just malachite.

25
00:01:03.133 --> 00:01:04.900
If I'm not mistaken

26
00:01:05.366 --> 00:01:06.200
We

27
00:01:07.133 --> 00:01:08.200
Lights are off

28
00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:10.100
Lights Off
