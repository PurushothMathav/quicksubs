00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.466
Thank you, Master Yang

2
00:00:06.166 --> 00:00:07.933
If you had let me heal sooner

3
00:00:07.933 --> 00:00:09.866
It won't bother you

4
00:00:09.966 --> 00:00:12.633
You'd better rest as soon as possible

5
00:00:12.666 --> 00:00:14.633
Thank you Master Yang for saving me

6
00:00:18.333 --> 00:00:19.200
Miss Hou

7
00:00:20.766 --> 00:00:22.900
Miss Hou, Mr. Hou

8
00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:24.800
You'd better send it down to rest

9
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:26.733
What are you still doing?

10
00:00:26.733 --> 00:00:28.700
Hurry up and help my father to rest in the back

11
00:00:37.966 --> 00:00:40.166
Miss Hou, what does this have to do with him?

12
00:00:40.166 --> 00:00:42.666
This is clearly the credit of Doctor Sun

13
00:00:42.666 --> 00:00:45.200
Doctor Sun's distortion effect comes a little slower

14
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.300
What does it have to do with him?

15
00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:49.400
It's just that the Ming actor knows it at a glance

16
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.466
Also play stupid for this grandson

17
00:00:51.466 --> 00:00:54.133
Miss Wang, I think you'd better distinguish right from wrong.

18
00:00:54.133 --> 00:00:55.800
Return Sun God to Justice

19
00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:56.966
Frog in the Well

20
00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:57.900
you

21
00:00:58.733 --> 00:01:00.300
Do you think so too?

22
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.100
No, no, I don't have Sun Hao

23
00:01:02.266 --> 00:01:04.533
May I ask where you are studying?

24
00:01:04.533 --> 00:01:06.100
Sun Sunyi you

25
00:01:07.066 --> 00:01:09.100
Xiao Haoren knew the situation just now at a glance

26
00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:09.933
Clearly Master Yang

27
00:01:09.933 --> 00:01:11.466
Art Toyota is Mr. Hou

28
00:01:11.466 --> 00:01:13.300
How dare you Liang family impersonate these parents?
