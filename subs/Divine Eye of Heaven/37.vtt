00:00:01.266 --> 00:00:03.300
Brother, you are amazing

2
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.300
Mom will be out of bed this morning

3
00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:07.900
Let's see if mom has recovered.

4
00:00:07.966 --> 00:00:09.466
You silly girl

5
00:00:09.466 --> 00:00:10.600
Sickness comes like a mountain

6
00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:11.900
Sick as ever

7
00:00:11.933 --> 00:00:12.933
Mom, this body?

8
00:00:12.933 --> 00:00:14.733
It will take a while to adjust

9
00:00:14.733 --> 00:00:17.866
Mainly still owe the hospital 2 million medical expenses

10
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.433
I don't have any spare money to buy stocks for my mother

11
00:00:20.533 --> 00:00:24.200
Oh, you don't have to worry about medical bills.

12
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:25.666
I solved it all

13
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:28.966
It's solved, how did you solve it?

14
00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:33.066
Well, you're not going to do anything illegal, are you?

15
00:00:33.066 --> 00:00:34.666
What are you thinking about?

16
00:00:34.666 --> 00:00:37.066
Your brother, when have I ever done anything illegal?

17
00:00:37.333 --> 00:00:40.566
I just sold the sewing box.

18
00:00:41.066 --> 00:00:42.800
Just that sewing box

19
00:00:42.966 --> 00:00:43.966
Value 2 million

20
00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:46.866
You'd better see for yourself

21
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.066
Eight eight eight 0

22
00:00:54.733 --> 00:00:57.633
Just those boxes, you sold 50 million

23
00:00:57.866 --> 00:01:01.300
Brother, you won't deceive others, will you?

24
00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.266
I cheated

25
00:01:03.933 --> 00:01:06.766
Well, they actually bought a sewing box.

26
00:01:06.766 --> 00:01:08.300
No loss at all

27
00:01:08.533 --> 00:01:10.066
If I wasn't in a hurry to use the money

28
00:01:10.066 --> 00:01:12.566
This sewing box can sell for 60 to 70 million

29
00:01:13.566 --> 00:01:16.033
Really? That's great.

30
00:01:16.133 --> 00:01:18.833
Then mom can buy a lot of supplements

31
00:01:19.933 --> 00:01:23.066
Hey, by the way, let's go to the Chinese medicine store later.

32
00:01:23.066 --> 00:01:24.633
Give mom two more packs of medicine

33
00:01:24.866 --> 00:01:26.566
If two pairs of medicine come down

34
00:01:26.566 --> 00:01:28.733
Mom will almost be fine

35
00:01:28.733 --> 00:01:29.566
I believe you.

36
00:01:29.566 --> 00:01:31.000
Let's go, now.
