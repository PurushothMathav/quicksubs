00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:02.033
Win total win total

2
00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:03.333
I really missed it.

3
00:00:03.333 --> 00:00:05.000
Mr. Sheng misread

4
00:00:05.533 --> 00:00:06.366
misread

5
00:00:06.366 --> 00:00:08.766
And I want to buy my sewing box for 10 bucks

6
00:00:08.866 --> 00:00:11.833
I see your eyes are quite bright

7
00:00:11.933 --> 00:00:13.000
Wrong, Mr. Sheng

8
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.666
Don't listen to this kid's nonsense

9
00:00:14.666 --> 00:00:15.866
I'm talking nonsense

10
00:00:16.133 --> 00:00:18.900
You let the receptionist tie me up and put glass pieces in my mouth

11
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.200
Let me go out and learn to bark

12
00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:21.433
Am I talking nonsense?

13
00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.200
Mr. Sheng, I am just a receptionist

14
00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:24.066
I don't know about antiques

15
00:00:24.066 --> 00:00:25.066
That's why I bet with him

16
00:00:25.066 --> 00:00:26.800
I really didn't let him do that.

17
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.900
Mr. Sheng, we are joking with him

18
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.200
Just kidding.

19
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:32.933
So this temperament uses you to

20
00:00:32.933 --> 00:00:35.233
I deliberately made a bad face again in the afternoon

21
00:00:35.533 --> 00:00:37.033
What did you do?

22
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.966
Do I really think I can't see that you are setting me up?

23
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.066
Wronged?

24
00:00:41.066 --> 00:00:43.033
I didn't mean that.

25
00:00:43.066 --> 00:00:45.766
I just want to give everyone a step down?

26
00:00:45.766 --> 00:00:47.700
Holy grass, don't listen to his nonsense

27
00:00:48.133 --> 00:00:49.566
He's a rapist.

28
00:00:49.566 --> 00:00:52.633
Rapist Wu Limin told you

29
00:00:52.733 --> 00:00:54.433
Said he was not an accomplice

30
00:00:54.533 --> 00:00:58.433
Boy, you just said that the money is like taking one of these.

31
00:00:58.466 --> 00:01:00.300
Then he has to take the money out of his pocket

32
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.266
I want to buy this one of yours.

33
00:01:01.266 --> 00:01:02.900
Is it suitable? Yes.

34
00:01:03.566 --> 00:01:06.633
Chief, this matter is very serious

35
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.700
Maybe he knows the value of this thing.

36
00:01:09.766 --> 00:01:11.600
So he wants to be a white wolf with empty gloves.

37
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.833
Use your banner to hack the truth

38
00:01:14.166 --> 00:01:15.166
Of course, yeah.

39
00:01:15.266 --> 00:01:17.800
You may not pay attention to this seventy-seven million

40
00:01:18.166 --> 00:01:19.400
After all these years

41
00:01:19.533 --> 00:01:22.633
You don't know how much you warmed the jewelry.

42
00:01:22.866 --> 00:01:25.000
I don't know how much more it is than in our store.

43
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.233
How much has your reputation in the antique world been hacked?
