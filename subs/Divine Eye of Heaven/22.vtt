00:00:01.933 --> 00:00:04.900
Don't say it, the dean is right

2
00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:06.733
Since we have no money

3
00:00:06.733 --> 00:00:08.233
Then leave the hospital

4
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.466
OK, then let's go out and I'll eat with you

5
00:00:12.466 --> 00:00:14.200
Don't ask you quacks

6
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:15.733
Who uses medicine?

7
00:00:15.733 --> 00:00:17.733
Okay, what's the matter with him?

8
00:00:17.733 --> 00:00:19.900
Yao Ming, I'm not unreasonable either.

9
00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:21.766
I'll give you a week.

10
00:00:21.766 --> 00:00:25.000
If you can't afford 2 million in a week

11
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.233
Just wait for the court summons

12
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.500
Our family never owes anyone money

13
00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.900
Don't worry, we won't cherish it without you urging us.

14
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.200
Ah, that's right, Miss Hou

15
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.533
Quack doctors here are so laborious

16
00:00:39.533 --> 00:00:41.300
I'm afraid it will delay Mr. Hou's illness

17
00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.166
I will be ashamed at that time

18
00:00:43.166 --> 00:00:44.566
What do you mean by the surname Yang?

19
00:00:44.566 --> 00:00:47.166
Mr. Hou has a major cardiovascular problem

20
00:00:47.266 --> 00:00:50.600
It's only been three days, I advise you

21
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:52.466
I advise you.

22
00:00:52.466 --> 00:00:54.500
Get Hou Lao a better hospital

23
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.866
Later, maybe I'll have to prepare a coffin

24
00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.900
My dad's birthday is in two days

25
00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:01.366
You said he only had three days left

26
00:01:01.366 --> 00:01:02.766
You're cursing my dad

27
00:01:02.766 --> 00:01:03.566
Yao Ming

28
00:01:04.333 --> 00:01:07.133
I'll give you some color, you really look at people's houses, right?

29
00:01:07.133 --> 00:01:09.566
You, a migrant worker, don't know shit

30
00:01:09.566 --> 00:01:11.566
How dare you speak out here

31
00:01:11.733 --> 00:01:14.600
Mr. Hou is here for a routine check-up

32
00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.800
In addition to some age-related diseases

33
00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.700
Nothing else.

34
00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:20.800
Hmm, do you think

35
00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.133
Just you poor people.

36
00:01:23.133 --> 00:01:26.400
Do you have to die to remember the hospital?
