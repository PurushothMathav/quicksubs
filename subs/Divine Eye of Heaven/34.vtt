00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.966
Ah Yao Ming

2
00:00:01.966 --> 00:00:03.533
For the sake of what we used to have

3
00:00:03.533 --> 00:00:04.800
I beg you to help me

4
00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:07.333
I will definitely explain it when I go out.

5
00:00:07.333 --> 00:00:08.333
You didn't rape me.

6
00:00:08.333 --> 00:00:11.800
I slandered you, please help me, I beg you.

7
00:00:12.666 --> 00:00:14.500
So now you admit it?

8
00:00:14.766 --> 00:00:15.800
It's all my fault

9
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:16.700
It's my fault

10
00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:18.733
It was my Hong Xing who betrayed you out of the wall

11
00:00:18.733 --> 00:00:19.600
You let me out

12
00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.733
I will definitely pay you back 700 after going out.

13
00:00:21.733 --> 00:00:22.900
I beg you

14
00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:24.900
Little brother

15
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:26.300
How do you say to deal with it?

16
00:00:26.766 --> 00:00:28.600
I'm going to keep him to turn himself in

17
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.600
Give me back my innocence

18
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:31.966
Did you hear it?

19
00:00:31.966 --> 00:00:33.866
I can spare your life today.

20
00:00:33.866 --> 00:00:35.966
But what should I say after I get out of prison?

21
00:00:36.066 --> 00:00:37.033
You know what?

22
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Thank you Mr. Sheng

23
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:39.866
Thank you for your forgiveness

24
00:00:39.866 --> 00:00:42.766
I'm going out, I'm going out

25
00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:44.600
Mr. Shao

26
00:00:44.866 --> 00:00:46.600
If we hadn't heard rumors outside

27
00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:47.866
If you come to check in person

28
00:00:47.933 --> 00:00:49.766
I'm afraid I won't know until today

29
00:00:49.766 --> 00:00:51.633
Che Rujuan will be so dark

30
00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:53.166
What makes me even more curious is

31
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:54.266
This behavior

32
00:00:54.366 --> 00:00:57.000
No one in the store wants to report you

33
00:00:58.166 --> 00:01:00.533
No no I don't know I'm just a waiter

34
00:01:00.533 --> 00:01:02.200
I don't even know antiques

35
00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:03.800
How do I report?

36
00:01:03.933 --> 00:01:06.800
Little brother, everything today is because of you

37
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.833
What do you say should be done?

38
00:01:10.466 --> 00:01:11.800
It's my dog eyes that look down on people

39
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.200
I despise people

40
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.366
It's all my fault

41
00:01:14.566 --> 00:01:16.066
You adults don't remember villains

42
00:01:16.066 --> 00:01:17.300
Please tell our boss.

43
00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.033
Treat me like a fart

44
00:01:19.466 --> 00:01:21.466
Remember your promise with me?
