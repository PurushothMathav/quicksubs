00:00:00.666 --> 00:00:02.433
Be careful don't go don't go

00:00:02.733 --> 00:00:03.700
I'm fine.

3
00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:07.166
Ok I tell you

4
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.533
If you dare to touch our family today

5
00:00:09.533 --> 00:00:10.666
I will go to court tomorrow.

6
00:00:10.666 --> 00:00:11.333
I'll tell you what.

7
00:00:11.333 --> 00:00:13.033
I'll tell you what.

8
00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:14.566
I'll tell you what.

9
00:00:14.566 --> 00:00:17.900
I hahahahahaha

10
00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.366
Sue him you sue him

11
00:00:21.066 --> 00:00:22.300
I'll tell you what.

12
00:00:22.466 --> 00:00:25.400
Now this goal belongs to my mother's family

13
00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:27.366
And all the formalities

14
00:00:27.733 --> 00:00:31.566
It's all legal hahahaha you fart

15
00:00:31.566 --> 00:00:33.266
Threatened contract he voids

16
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.466
Invalid hahahahaha

17
00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:38.500
Hey

18
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:40.400
newspaper

19
00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:42.000
This walnut

20
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.166
Was mortgaged to us in the form of a debt

21
00:00:45.166 --> 00:00:47.233
Otherwise, your old man is so busy

22
00:00:47.266 --> 00:00:49.066
Why intermediate and advanced wards

23
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.866
Why is there an expert consultation?

24
00:00:50.933 --> 00:00:54.833
Why spend 2 million in just a few days?

25
00:00:57.533 --> 00:00:59.366
You can take this to court

26
00:00:59.733 --> 00:01:02.066
The court will also sentence me to Liang Jiaying

27
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:06.000
Understand? 200 can't be so much

28
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.233
Two hundred dollars to spend

29
00:01:08.166 --> 00:01:10.300
Why Qu Rang's Family?

30
00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:13.166
Tell me we can defer hospital bills

31
00:01:13.266 --> 00:01:16.900
Hey, I didn't say no, little girl

32
00:01:18.166 --> 00:01:21.266
Senior, I said someone paid for you in advance.

33
00:01:21.533 --> 00:01:22.866
But this debt

34
00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:24.666
It's to be paid back.

35
00:01:24.666 --> 00:01:27.666
But age and I said it was a food knife to give us pads.

36
00:01:27.666 --> 00:01:28.333
Paid for

37
00:01:28.333 --> 00:01:32.066
You haven't said that you will use our slaves to pay off the debt?

38
00:01:32.066 --> 00:01:33.400
When you borrow money

39
00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:36.000
Don't you ask who lent you the money?

40
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.600
Ah, is that my problem?

41
00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:39.500
Exactly.

42
00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.766
When you borrow money, you don't want to pay it back, and you don't want to pay it back.

43
00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:43.266
Otherwise, what about the assets?

44
00:01:43.266 --> 00:01:45.300
How can there be a good thing about mental illness now?

45
00:01:45.533 --> 00:01:46.933
2 million?

46
00:01:46.933 --> 00:01:49.500
Look at you in this dress and you know you can't afford it

47
00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.200
If you are kind enough to lend you

48
00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.366
You don't want to pay it back

49
00:01:52.366 --> 00:01:55.033
How can there be such a reason? It's you.

50
00:01:55.366 --> 00:01:57.300
Did you hear that?

51
00:01:57.766 --> 00:02:00.300
Go and sue if you have the guts.

52
00:02:00.933 --> 00:02:02.566
I'm not afraid to tell you

53
00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.200
Don't say this contract is legal

54
00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.400
Even if he is not legal

55
00:02:07.566 --> 00:02:10.100
In this one-third acre of land in the East Garden

56
00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.166
I want to sue a grain farm
