00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:02.600
This ginseng can grow so big

2
00:00:02.766 --> 00:00:03.866
Look at that.

3
00:00:04.066 --> 00:00:06.433
And his rhizomes are perfectly straight.

4
00:00:06.733 --> 00:00:09.733
How can wild animals have such a growing environment?

5
00:00:09.733 --> 00:00:12.900
I think it looks like it was artificially ripened.

6
00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.766
This is my video.

7
00:00:16.266 --> 00:00:17.400
Senior

8
00:00:18.466 --> 00:00:20.133
There are a lot of tricks on the Internet.

9
00:00:20.133 --> 00:00:21.766
Then why do you say we play antiques?

10
00:00:21.766 --> 00:00:24.800
Those who play jadeite and medicinal materials never read it online

11
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.266
That's because through the screen

12
00:00:26.266 --> 00:00:28.400
There are many things you can't tell

13
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.666
Wait a minute, Master Xu

14
00:00:30.666 --> 00:00:32.500
I'm not questioning your authority

15
00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.500
But you are Mr. Sheng after all

16
00:00:35.166 --> 00:00:38.866
Mr. Sheng and Yang Ming are as good as brothers

17
00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:42.866
You said this to help Yang Ming out of the siege, right?

18
00:00:42.933 --> 00:00:45.633
That's right, you're all in this together

19
00:00:45.866 --> 00:00:47.800
Must be demeaning my eyes

20
00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.066
God, is this thing true or false?

21
00:00:50.666 --> 00:00:51.466
You test

22
00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.966
How can I test without equipment?

23
00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.800
Why use an instrument for something that can get into people's mouths?

24
00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:00.233
What to do if someone dies?

25
00:01:00.466 --> 00:01:01.566
human life

26
00:01:02.366 --> 00:01:05.500
God, didn't you just say that this wild ginseng

27
00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.466
Eating it can prolong life

28
00:01:07.466 --> 00:01:08.466
Raw meat?

29
00:01:09.066 --> 00:01:11.466
Why are you still afraid of eating people's lives?

30
00:01:11.733 --> 00:01:14.866
You really eat your life, Xiao Ming
