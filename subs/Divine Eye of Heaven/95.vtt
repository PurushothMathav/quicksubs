00:00:00.666 --> 00:00:03.633
Master Yang, you must have heard it just now

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.066
I heard that this handed down jade screen has some bumps.

3
00:00:07.566 --> 00:00:09.100
And it's been lost for a long time

4
00:00:09.666 --> 00:00:11.266
But one kick is just a rumor

5
00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:12.566
No food

6
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:13.966
Can't be serious

7
00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:15.500
Pardon me?

8
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.666
As for the loss

9
00:00:17.666 --> 00:00:19.933
I think it's just made up by unofficial history

10
00:00:19.933 --> 00:00:21.066
Not very credible

11
00:00:21.166 --> 00:00:22.666
But I have to admit

12
00:00:22.666 --> 00:00:24.366
Your official family is really amazing

13
00:00:24.366 --> 00:00:27.600
You can even get something like this

14
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.033
Let him see the world again

15
00:00:29.566 --> 00:00:31.266
Hey miss guan

16
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.400
Miss Guan

17
00:00:33.733 --> 00:00:35.300
It's your turn to announce the results

18
00:00:38.533 --> 00:00:39.466
Master Yang

19
00:00:40.166 --> 00:00:41.366
I guess you're right.

20
00:00:42.566 --> 00:00:45.066
I admit that I misread you before.

21
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.500
You are indeed a man of real talent and learning.

22
00:00:48.866 --> 00:00:50.766
What? That's impossible.

23
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:52.500
Miss Guan

24
00:00:52.766 --> 00:00:55.366
If you can't provide strong evidence

25
00:00:55.366 --> 00:00:58.300
I have to suspect that you are lying to him.

26
00:01:02.733 --> 00:01:03.966
Here we go.

27
00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:07.633
This is a picture by Mr. Jiang, the antique master

28
00:01:07.666 --> 00:01:08.866
It's clear inside

29
00:01:08.866 --> 00:01:11.600
It is clearly written on the authenticity of this porcelain vase

30
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:12.966
If you don't believe

31
00:01:12.966 --> 00:01:13.966
Ask him again

32
00:01:14.566 --> 00:01:15.866
But it doesn't matter.

33
00:01:15.933 --> 00:01:17.066
Just a few days

34
00:01:17.533 --> 00:01:20.100
Mr. Jiang will report the matter to the above

35
00:01:20.133 --> 00:01:20.933
Pretty soon.

36
00:01:20.966 --> 00:01:23.766
This vase will also be placed behind the National Museum

37
00:01:24.366 --> 00:01:27.366
Then everyone will see and share

38
00:01:33.466 --> 00:01:35.166
Since no one has an opinion

39
00:01:35.266 --> 00:01:37.800
Then let's wait for the third question.

40
00:01:38.133 --> 00:01:41.733
Why, Master Xie, are you still not satisfied?

41
00:01:41.733 --> 00:01:45.200
No, I believe Miss Guan is in this matter

42
00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:46.700
Don't tell lies

43
00:01:46.733 --> 00:01:48.000
I just want to

44
00:01:49.133 --> 00:01:52.900
Master Yang, you have answered two questions correctly in a row

45
00:01:53.066 --> 00:01:56.500
Why don't we gamble on the combination?
