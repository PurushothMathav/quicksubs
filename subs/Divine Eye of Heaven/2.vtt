00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.000
Cher is higher, higher, lower, lower.

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.666
That's right, that's right.

3
00:00:04.666 --> 00:00:05.666
Know know know

4
00:00:06.466 --> 00:00:08.400
Brother, you are back.

5
00:00:08.933 --> 00:00:10.366
Son is back

6
00:00:10.966 --> 00:00:14.333
Brother, you will get married the day after tomorrow.

7
00:00:14.333 --> 00:00:16.733
Why is this complexion so bad?

8
00:00:16.733 --> 00:00:19.233
Did you quarrel with Minmin?

9
00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.300
Who is it? Take the ear

10
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:26.600
come

11
00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:31.233
Hey go

12
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.566
What are you doing?

13
00:00:36.566 --> 00:00:37.900
What's that for?

14
00:00:38.566 --> 00:00:41.100
Your son is suspected of forcing women to have sex

15
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.266
We're going to take him back for questioning. Impossible

16
00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.000
My brother has always been honest

17
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.633
Are you mistaken?

18
00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:48.766
Let's go again!

19
00:00:48.766 --> 00:00:51.133
Please I beg you

20
00:00:51.133 --> 00:00:52.900
I got him married for a few days

21
00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:53.766
Auntie, get up

22
00:00:53.766 --> 00:00:55.200
Auntie, don't forget auntie, I beg you

23
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.333
I knelt down for you

24
00:00:56.333 --> 00:00:59.500
I beg you, auntie, get up

25
00:01:00.366 --> 00:01:01.166
Ah!

26
00:01:02.066 --> 00:01:04.300
Auntie, we also enforce the law impartially

27
00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:07.266
Since someone reported the case, we can't help but investigate it.

28
00:01:07.866 --> 00:01:09.600
If he is ok

29
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.366
We'll get him back ASAP.

30
00:01:11.466 --> 00:01:13.133
The law doesn't wrong a good person

31
00:01:13.133 --> 00:01:15.466
You can't spare a bad guy, can you?

32
00:01:15.733 --> 00:01:16.300
brother

33
00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:18.666
Please explain what's going on

34
00:01:18.666 --> 00:01:19.666
I am innocent

35
00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.533
In addition to preparing for the wedding these two days

36
00:01:21.533 --> 00:01:23.300
Just stay with Minmin

37
00:01:23.333 --> 00:01:23.966
You know

38
00:01:23.966 --> 00:01:25.966
How could you and I do something like that?

39
00:01:25.966 --> 00:01:27.900
Comrade police, did you hear that?

40
00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.700
My brother and my sister-in-law have been busy

41
00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:30.566
Marriage

42
00:01:30.566 --> 00:01:33.066
He couldn't have done something like that.

43
00:01:33.333 --> 00:01:34.133
you

44
00:01:34.266 --> 00:01:37.166
Are you independent?

45
00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.966
The person who reported the crime is for you
