00:00:02.266 --> 00:00:04.933
Can't you see I'm chatting with Miss Wu?

2
00:00:04.933 --> 00:00:07.400
Any cat or dog will let me go

3
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.033
What do you want?

4
00:00:09.133 --> 00:00:11.366
I don't want money either

5
00:00:11.366 --> 00:00:15.600
It's just that he has to be noisy and can't drive you away

6
00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:18.633
Xiaomin is you

7
00:00:18.666 --> 00:00:21.200
Uh miss wu, you know him

8
00:00:22.866 --> 00:00:26.700
It's the guy I told you about

9
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:28.200
Yang Min

10
00:00:28.333 --> 00:00:31.200
What are you doing here without the support of your official family?

11
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.366
Could it be that he wants to deceive in the name of the official family?

12
00:00:35.733 --> 00:00:38.100
You and I have nothing to do with each other

13
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.966
What do you care what I do?

14
00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.066
Ah, you're here to sell something.

15
00:00:45.266 --> 00:00:47.166
Your family is so poor

16
00:00:47.166 --> 00:00:48.666
What antiques are there?

17
00:00:48.666 --> 00:00:51.400
I'm afraid I didn't take something casually.

18
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.366
You want to lie in the name of an official again?

19
00:00:55.566 --> 00:00:57.033
You are the master of treasure appraisal

20
00:00:57.066 --> 00:01:00.500
That's right, this old man is the treasure appraisal expert of this store

21
00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.300
Are you here to sell something?

22
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.900
Come get it and I'll show you

23
00:01:07.366 --> 00:01:10.100
Isn't this your sewing box?

24
00:01:10.166 --> 00:01:12.033
This shit could be an antique

25
00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:13.866
Is he an antique?

26
00:01:14.533 --> 00:01:15.333
It counts.

27
00:01:16.933 --> 00:01:20.800
If this shit is worth more than 10 bucks, I

28
00:01:22.333 --> 00:01:25.866
Hmph, I'll eat this glass

29
00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:26.900
Good idea.

30
00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.766
Then I'd like to see how you eat it

31
00:01:29.933 --> 00:01:31.966
If it's not worth 10 bucks

32
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.600
How about you just eat this glass?

33
00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.633
We'll see won't we.
