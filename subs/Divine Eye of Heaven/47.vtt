1
00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:05.433
It's nothing good.

2
00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.300
They're all imitations now.

3
00:00:07.333 --> 00:00:08.766
Also sold for tens of millions

4
00:00:09.766 --> 00:00:11.266
You're done. You're an adult now.

5
00:00:15.133 --> 00:00:18.066
Hey little brother, come and see

6
00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.566
Ouch, little brother, good eyesight.

7
00:00:24.566 --> 00:00:26.866
This pen holder is a good thing.

8
00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:31.200
Little brother, are you going to give it away?

9
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:32.400
Or collect it yourself?

10
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:33.766
Give it away hey

11
00:00:33.766 --> 00:00:35.366
Then we can have customized packaging.

12
00:00:35.366 --> 00:00:38.066
Make sure you take it out and have enough face

13
00:00:38.066 --> 00:00:40.900
Really? How much are these two?

14
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.800
500 yuan

15
00:00:47.166 --> 00:00:48.400
What 500 bucks?

16
00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:49.800
Is 5 million

17
00:00:50.466 --> 00:00:53.866
5 million you see your pen holder tread is rough

18
00:00:53.866 --> 00:00:55.400
Obviously a modern imitation

19
00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:56.833
Do you take advantage of me?

20
00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.333
How can this be a modern copy?

21
00:00:59.333 --> 00:01:00.766
Look at this foot

22
00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.966
This is clearly an old object

23
00:01:03.866 --> 00:01:05.066
Let me tell you something.

24
00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.500
That Goldman Sachs antique store two days ago

25
00:01:08.533 --> 00:01:10.600
An earthquake wire box from the Qianlong period

26
00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:11.700
Sold for 50 million

27
00:01:11.733 --> 00:01:12.533
What's more?

28
00:01:12.533 --> 00:01:15.033
This is the red earth oil of the original blue and white glaze.

29
00:01:15.166 --> 00:01:16.700
But look at your underside

30
00:01:16.966 --> 00:01:18.266
Rough so evenly

31
00:01:18.266 --> 00:01:20.266
At first glance, it has been polished by a grinder.

32
00:01:20.366 --> 00:01:21.633
But I don't know the goods.

33
00:01:21.933 --> 00:01:24.266
Boy you can do it
