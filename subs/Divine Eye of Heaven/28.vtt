00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:03.000
Why did Yang Mi dare to gamble or admit it?

2
00:00:03.133 --> 00:00:05.933
If my truth and truth are only worth 5 bucks

3
00:00:05.933 --> 00:00:08.366
I will naturally eat this glass

4
00:00:08.366 --> 00:00:11.066
But obviously in empty gloves white wolf

5
00:00:11.166 --> 00:00:12.000
No way.

6
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.433
Oh boy

7
00:00:14.466 --> 00:00:16.433
Don't be so suspicious?

8
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.600
Look, give me the sewing box

9
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:19.866
I'll give you the money.

10
00:00:19.866 --> 00:00:22.700
It just so happens that my house is also short of a box for needle and thread.

11
00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:24.866
Doesn't this avoid embarrassment for everyone?

12
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.866
Why are you feeling guilty?

13
00:00:26.866 --> 00:00:28.500
Start buying and selling

14
00:00:28.533 --> 00:00:31.500
Young man, don't be shameless.

15
00:00:31.766 --> 00:00:33.966
Since my box is so worthless

16
00:00:33.966 --> 00:00:35.633
Why do you have to buy it?

17
00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.133
Think I'm stupid

18
00:00:37.133 --> 00:00:37.933
Yang Min

19
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.700
Since I keep buying your box to give you face.

20
00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.900
Either you learn to bark today

21
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:44.633
Or just take the money and leave

22
00:00:44.666 --> 00:00:47.033
Otherwise, don't blame us for being rude to you.

23
00:00:48.266 --> 00:00:51.266
I didn't expect this famous Goldman Sachs antique shop

24
00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.566
It turned out to be a black eat black

25
00:00:53.566 --> 00:00:56.266
Top of the bandits who can only sell

26
00:00:56.333 --> 00:00:58.966
Dare to speak ill of our boss

27
00:00:58.966 --> 00:00:59.833
security guard

28
00:01:00.366 --> 00:01:05.300
I'd like to see who dares to call me a bandit
