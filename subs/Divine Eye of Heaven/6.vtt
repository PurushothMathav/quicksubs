00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:01.233
What!

2
00:00:02.466 --> 00:00:05.600
50 I also heard these two days

3
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.233
Wu Limin has long been with Liang Shao of that grain group

4
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:13.966
Okay, and our family gave him the cemetery

5
00:00:14.133 --> 00:00:16.500
He turned around and gave it to the grain group

6
00:00:17.533 --> 00:00:21.666
Bitch, the food will be sacrificed to the ancestors tomorrow

7
00:00:21.933 --> 00:00:24.266
To move their purpose to our house

8
00:00:24.266 --> 00:00:26.300
Our family is an ancestral purpose

9
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.500
Besides, Dad is still there

10
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:29.666
How is that possible?

11
00:00:30.066 --> 00:00:31.466
Never let them do this

12
00:00:31.466 --> 00:00:33.633
Yes, brother has to think of a way

13
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:36.266
You said that our mother has kept our father for so long

14
00:00:36.266 --> 00:00:39.000
If only Mom knew that Dad had been gone for so long

15
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.800
Someone took it out again

16
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.000
Then I'm afraid of him

17
00:00:43.166 --> 00:00:45.200
It's Mom's fault

18
00:00:45.533 --> 00:00:47.033
Really?

19
00:00:47.866 --> 00:00:49.400
Mom has no face

20
00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.766
I want to meet your father

21
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.700
I don't want the bride price.

22
00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:59.366
But if they want to touch our cemetery

23
00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:04.100
You have to step over my corpse

24
00:01:11.166 --> 00:01:13.766
Dad, this is my new secretary

25
00:01:13.766 --> 00:01:15.766
The cemetery of the world is what he passed on to me

26
00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.133
Oh, she's a nice girl

27
00:01:19.133 --> 00:01:21.100
Thank you for your appreciation

28
00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:22.400
You are in prison

29
00:01:22.466 --> 00:01:26.000
I still have a lot to learn from Liang Shao

30
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.800
Dad, the guests are almost here

31
00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:30.800
We can start moving graves

32
00:01:32.866 --> 00:01:33.833
start

33
00:01:38.166 --> 00:01:39.600
Stop! Stop

34
00:01:40.166 --> 00:01:42.033
Don't worry about him. Wow.
