00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:04.833
I was born in a remote mountain in late summer

2
00:00:04.866 --> 00:00:07.433
I grew up not eating enough and not wearing warm clothes

3
00:00:07.766 --> 00:00:10.966
I got into college by my own efforts

4
00:00:12.333 --> 00:00:16.100
He became the first college student to walk out of the mountains

5
00:00:16.533 --> 00:00:20.100
I thought I was going to be superior from now on

6
00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.866
But when I came to this city, I found that

7
00:00:23.933 --> 00:00:26.533
College students like me are everywhere

8
00:00:26.533 --> 00:00:29.633
I'm just an insignificant inferior

9
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:32.833
Until one day

10
00:00:33.466 --> 00:00:36.000
I met a man whose parents died

11
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.500
The wealthy blind man

12
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.566
I knew I had a chance to change my life.

13
00:00:43.166 --> 00:00:44.666
So you approach me

14
00:00:44.666 --> 00:00:46.600
Just to change destiny, right?

15
00:00:47.366 --> 00:00:48.466
Exactly.

16
00:00:50.533 --> 00:00:51.800
Will you be my girlfriend?

17
00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:00.700
That night

18
00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.666
You waited six or seven hours downstairs at my house

19
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.900
Did you pretend that day too?

20
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:10.566
You know

21
00:01:10.566 --> 00:01:13.600
Did you get the flowers I gave you that day?

22
00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:17.066
I picked it up from the trash can

23
00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.233
Ha ha.

24
00:01:22.866 --> 00:01:24.966
Hahahaha
