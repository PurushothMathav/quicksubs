1
00:00:00.466 --> 00:00:03.033
The 10 billion order we agreed on before

2
00:00:03.666 --> 00:00:05.266
Is it time to sign?

3
00:00:05.333 --> 00:00:06.333
heard

4
00:00:06.333 --> 00:00:10.066
You bought Xia Meng's stock at a low price

5
00:00:10.566 --> 00:00:13.966
Mr. Su, we spent a whole 200 million

6
00:00:13.966 --> 00:00:15.300
Already a lot

7
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:17.666
This summer dream is an idle person

8
00:00:17.666 --> 00:00:19.633
No contribution to the company

9
00:00:19.666 --> 00:00:20.966
He left the company

10
00:00:20.966 --> 00:00:22.700
We will only develop better

11
00:00:22.766 --> 00:00:25.366
That's right, Xia Meng, what about this woman?

12
00:00:25.366 --> 00:00:27.233
There is a big problem with character

13
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.300
I heard

14
00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:30.533
He just got divorced recently

15
00:00:30.533 --> 00:00:33.900
I found a little white face, married for the second time, and already living together

16
00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:35.500
Pardon me?

17
00:00:36.266 --> 00:00:38.033
How did my uncle know I was married?

18
00:00:38.166 --> 00:00:40.100
Xia Qing must have told me

19
00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.500
It shouldn't be.

20
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.766
Xia Meng is not a frivolous girl

21
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.066
President Su, this matter is countless

22
00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:53.300
Xia Meng and that little white face live opposite my house

23
00:00:53.966 --> 00:00:55.466
That's a pity too.

24
00:00:55.466 --> 00:00:58.966
Mr. Su, the 10 billion order we agreed on

25
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.400
Why don't you sign it now?

26
00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:01.300
OK

27
00:01:01.933 --> 00:01:03.466
You mean that order?

28
00:01:03.466 --> 00:01:06.100
I'm not going to give it to the Xia Group anymore.

29
00:01:06.333 --> 00:01:08.100
Mr. Su, are you kidding me?

30
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.300
This tens of billions of orders will not be given to us by Xia Group.

31
00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:11.366
Who else can I give it to?

32
00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:13.733
For Xia Meng Xia Meng

33
00:01:13.733 --> 00:01:14.333
For Xia Meng

34
00:01:14.333 --> 00:01:17.566
Mr. Su Xia Meng, he is a woman with bad character

35
00:01:17.566 --> 00:01:19.666
Why does he have tens of billions of orders?

36
00:01:19.733 --> 00:01:21.433
For saving my life

37
00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.666
Xia Meng, this girl not only saved my life

38
00:01:24.766 --> 00:01:26.900
He also feels like me

39
00:01:27.466 --> 00:01:29.566
I don't care what happens to other people.

40
00:01:29.566 --> 00:01:32.966
This tens of billions of orders is a thank you gift to him.
