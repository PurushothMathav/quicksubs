00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:07.166
Time is reincarnated

2
00:00:07.266 --> 00:00:08.833
But I didn't get comfortable again.

3
00:00:08.933 --> 00:00:10.233
It's recovery.

4
00:00:11.066 --> 00:00:13.466
This means that as long as I die

5
00:00:13.466 --> 00:00:15.766
The time will return to 12 noon that day

6
00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:21.333
Time is running out.

7
00:00:21.333 --> 00:00:22.666
Why aren't you here yet?

8
00:00:22.666 --> 00:00:24.600
Madam, what are you waiting for?

9
00:00:27.766 --> 00:00:28.766
This patient

10
00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:30.333
Are you waiting for me?

11
00:00:30.333 --> 00:00:32.966
Doctor Fu, you think too much, I'm not waiting for you.

12
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:35.866
Are you blind?

13
00:00:35.866 --> 00:00:37.100
Not waiting for me

14
00:00:37.133 --> 00:00:38.300
Who else can we wait for?

15
00:00:38.333 --> 00:00:39.833
I am the world I know

16
00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:41.333
Stanford Genius Doctor

17
00:00:41.333 --> 00:00:43.366
Nobel Prize in Medicine winner Yanling Fu

18
00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.000
I don't need you to help me heal

19
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.433
Thank you for having the courage to talk to me like this

20
00:00:49.733 --> 00:00:51.500
Don't come here

21
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:54.400
Old man be careful

22
00:00:55.366 --> 00:00:57.266
Oops, are you alright?

23
00:00:57.266 --> 00:00:59.366
Oops I'm fine I'm fine

24
00:00:59.366 --> 00:01:00.433
Oops oops

25
00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.266
This saved two lives

26
00:01:02.366 --> 00:01:03.900
Doctor Fu, wake up

27
00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:04.700
Doctor Fu

28
00:01:05.166 --> 00:01:06.000
Doctor Fu
