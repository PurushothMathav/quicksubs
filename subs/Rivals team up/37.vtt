00:00:03.733 --> 00:00:05.766
Come and eat fruit

2
00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:08.733
Mom, although you have been discharged from the hospital

3
00:00:08.733 --> 00:00:11.066
But try to go out as little as possible during this time

4
00:00:11.066 --> 00:00:12.400
Take care of your body first

5
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.666
My body, my heart knows

6
00:00:15.466 --> 00:00:18.266
Oh, by the way, how are Miss Xia's eyes?

7
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.500
Miss Xia disguised herself as a blind person

8
00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.233
It's better not to let my mom know

9
00:00:22.566 --> 00:00:23.433
Mom

10
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.533
I already operated on him.

11
00:00:25.533 --> 00:00:27.800
His eyes have now regained their sight

12
00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.000
Really ouch

13
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.233
This Miss Xia is kind-hearted and kind-hearted

14
00:00:32.266 --> 00:00:34.100
Good people are rewarded

15
00:00:34.166 --> 00:00:36.500
Right? I have one more thing to tell you.

16
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:37.866
So what's up?

17
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Miss Xia has divorced

18
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.466
And the shares in his hands

19
00:00:41.466 --> 00:00:43.066
Bought by his ex-husband at a low price

20
00:00:43.066 --> 00:00:44.566
That's great.

21
00:00:44.766 --> 00:00:47.033
Miss Xia loses shares in the company

22
00:00:47.766 --> 00:00:49.900
What's there to be happy about? You don't understand.

23
00:00:50.133 --> 00:00:53.900
Mom is happy that Miss Xia has divorced

24
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.266
Divorce is not a good thing either

25
00:00:56.266 --> 00:00:57.333
What's there to be happy about?

26
00:00:57.333 --> 00:00:58.133
Gorgeous

27
00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.000
Miss Xia is younger than you

28
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.566
Married for several years

29
00:01:01.566 --> 00:01:05.300
You are so 30 people who don't even have a girlfriend

30
00:01:05.966 --> 00:01:07.133
I'm too busy with work.

31
00:01:07.133 --> 00:01:08.566
No time for girlfriends

32
00:01:08.566 --> 00:01:09.666
Gorgeous

33
00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.166
You grew up surrounded by so many girls

34
00:01:12.166 --> 00:01:13.300
But you are fine

35
00:01:13.333 --> 00:01:15.400
Busy with research every day

36
00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:16.400
Write a dissertation

37
00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.166
Treat those girls like air

38
00:01:19.166 --> 00:01:21.500
Mom still wants to hold her grandson earlier

39
00:01:21.566 --> 00:01:24.533
Mom, you have a son, what grandson do you want?

40
00:01:24.533 --> 00:01:25.466
Serious point

41
00:01:25.466 --> 00:01:28.766
Mom has a very good candidate by her side

42
00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.800
How about you two cultivate a relationship

43
00:01:33.366 --> 00:01:35.466
I remember I hadn't finished my paper yet

44
00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.466
Mom, I'm going to work first

45
00:01:39.066 --> 00:01:41.000
Thank you mom you kid
