00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:01.766
You wait for me here

2
00:00:01.766 --> 00:00:02.700
I'm going to drive

3
00:00:03.766 --> 00:00:05.866
Ah, did you hear?

4
00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:07.800
We have a super handsome guy in our hospital

5
00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:08.933
You are in the recovery yard

6
00:00:08.933 --> 00:00:10.533
I heard he is an overseas medical doctor

7
00:00:10.533 --> 00:00:12.900
I just returned to China a few days ago to work in our hospital

8
00:00:13.066 --> 00:00:15.200
I wonder if he has a girlfriend?

9
00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:16.466
Look, there he is!

10
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:31.266
How much do you pay the doctor on WeChat?

11
00:00:31.266 --> 00:00:32.133
Let's add a friend

12
00:00:32.133 --> 00:00:34.866
There is a single bureau deputy doctor tonight, let's also participate

13
00:00:40.966 --> 00:00:42.033
You are blind

14
00:00:42.866 --> 00:00:44.400
Had a car accident as a child

15
00:00:44.466 --> 00:00:45.966
Permanent damage to the optic nerve

16
00:00:45.966 --> 00:00:47.233
I'm an eye doctor.

17
00:00:47.366 --> 00:00:48.866
You go hang up my expert number.

18
00:00:48.966 --> 00:00:50.900
I'll help you see if it's useless.

19
00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:52.400
I have seen countless names

20
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:53.800
There's nothing they can do.

21
00:00:54.333 --> 00:00:55.733
I'm not like them.

22
00:00:55.733 --> 00:00:56.966
Yes, Miss Xia

23
00:00:56.966 --> 00:00:59.833
Dr. Fu is a genius M.D. at Stanford

24
00:01:00.466 --> 00:01:02.500
Dr. Fu just won the Nobel Prize in Medicine last year

25
00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:03.800
Let him see it.

26
00:01:03.933 --> 00:01:05.166
I'll tell you what.

27
00:01:05.333 --> 00:01:07.066
If I can't cure your eyes

28
00:01:07.466 --> 00:01:10.166
Then no other doctor in the world can cure it

29
00:01:10.766 --> 00:01:12.666
Dr. Fu is really confident

30
00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.066
Killed
