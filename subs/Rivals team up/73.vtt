1
00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.066
I want to. Of course I want to.

2
00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:06.200
Is that so?

3
00:00:06.733 --> 00:00:09.900
Now, there's a new technology out there.

4
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.766
Can heal blind patients

5
00:00:12.666 --> 00:00:13.700
But

6
00:00:14.933 --> 00:00:18.300
That surgery carries a lot of risk.

7
00:00:19.933 --> 00:00:22.833
If the surgery fails

8
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.000
You will lose any follow-up treatment

9
00:00:26.666 --> 00:00:27.866
In other words

10
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.200
You will be blind for the rest of your life

11
00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.500
Even if there are more mature technologies in the future

12
00:00:33.766 --> 00:00:35.433
You don't have a chance to use it either

13
00:00:37.933 --> 00:00:40.866
What are the chances of success?

14
00:00:41.166 --> 00:00:43.000
If I do it myself

15
00:00:44.166 --> 00:00:44.966
probably

16
00:00:47.566 --> 00:00:49.700
Only 30%?

17
00:00:50.333 --> 00:00:53.000
So I never dared to tell you

18
00:00:57.966 --> 00:01:00.333
I don't agree with this surgery.

19
00:01:00.333 --> 00:01:01.733
Too risky

20
00:01:01.733 --> 00:01:03.633
I can't let Mengmeng take risks

21
00:01:04.066 --> 00:01:07.400
We should wait for technologies that have a higher success rate

22
00:01:07.566 --> 00:01:08.900
Even 10 years

23
00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.033
20 years, our Su family can afford to wait

24
00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.066
From a safety perspective

25
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.900
It is definitely better to wait for mature technology.

26
00:01:19.366 --> 00:01:21.666
But that would miss a lot

27
00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:23.666
Someone else's mother

28
00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.700
You can see your baby from birth

29
00:01:27.266 --> 00:01:29.400
They can watch their children grow

30
00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.500
Help them with their homework

31
00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.166
Accompany them to the amusement park

32
00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.866
But I can't do any of this.

33
00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.500
I still want to have my own figure

34
00:01:38.966 --> 00:01:41.233
I still want to see the beauty of the world

35
00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:43.400
But you are too long

36
00:01:44.733 --> 00:01:46.366
Missing the day and night
