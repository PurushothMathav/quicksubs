00:00:00.666 --> 00:00:02.466
Wang Xun, you are so brave

2
00:00:02.466 --> 00:00:04.266
How dare you call the shots for this palace

3
00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:05.800
Princess, you misunderstand?

4
00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:07.333
I'm not talking about Dong Qiang

5
00:00:07.333 --> 00:00:08.833
It's not Dong Qiang, who is it?

6
00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:10.833
Of course it's me.

7
00:00:10.933 --> 00:00:12.000
you

8
00:00:12.733 --> 00:00:14.900
Learn to be rich and have five cars to be tall

9
00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:17.166
Go up the hall and down the kitchen

10
00:00:17.166 --> 00:00:18.800
Handsome and meaningful

11
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:19.700
Of course.

12
00:00:20.266 --> 00:00:23.000
I'm the one who gave up

13
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.800
Princess

14
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.000
What did you say wrong again?

15
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.400
Ben Gong said

16
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:30.200
The most annoying thing is the self-righteous man

17
00:00:30.466 --> 00:00:34.466
Hey, why don't you get out of here?

18
00:00:38.566 --> 00:00:41.000
Obviously so ordinary, but so confident

19
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.766
Humph man

20
00:00:44.533 --> 00:00:46.800
The emperor was at the Duke's Mansion just now

21
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.366
The person recommended by Wang Xun is not General Dong

22
00:00:49.566 --> 00:00:50.866
Rather like himself

23
00:00:50.866 --> 00:00:52.766
Why are you

24
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.100
I see it.

25
00:00:55.266 --> 00:00:58.466
This is not a cannibalism, and it is not easy to refuse if your mouth is short.

26
00:00:58.666 --> 00:01:00.066
Are you just playing stupid?

27
00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:01.633
The Dong family is powerful

28
00:01:01.966 --> 00:01:05.266
The marriage of the Dong family has benefits and no regrets

29
00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:06.900
pity

30
00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.200
Zhang Mingdu likes the Dong family

31
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:10.633
As for Wang Xun

32
00:01:11.133 --> 00:01:13.266
This kid is scared

33
00:01:13.333 --> 00:01:15.600
I want to eat swan meat

34
00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:18.400
But

35
00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.300
Convenient and accurate dishes are really delicious.

36
00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:24.666
Hahaha

37
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.200
Ouch.

38
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.100
Ouch, my stomach hurts when I stand there.
