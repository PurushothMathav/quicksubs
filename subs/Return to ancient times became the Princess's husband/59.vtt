1
00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:03.000
Did you do this, King Liang?

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.266
You recruit from the truth

3
00:00:04.966 --> 00:00:06.266
Please learn from the father

4
00:00:06.466 --> 00:00:09.166
This has nothing to do with the son

5
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:14.666
Deceive the emperor

6
00:00:15.133 --> 00:00:19.400
Zhao San had a murderous and honest conversation with this person

7
00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.400
He was expelled from the mansion by the old minister three days ago

8
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.566
Assault order has been issued

9
00:00:24.866 --> 00:00:25.466
In addition

10
00:00:25.466 --> 00:00:28.933
The old minister also killed Chad Zhao Shan with this person's integrity

11
00:00:28.933 --> 00:00:31.400
It's about loyalty.

12
00:00:31.566 --> 00:00:34.666
Existing clues should be handed over to the Heaven Surveyor

13
00:00:34.666 --> 00:00:38.466
After being verified by the Sky Patrol, it will be brought to justice

14
00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:41.500
But what the old minister never expected was

15
00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.966
This person actually went crazy to assassinate the princess

16
00:00:46.266 --> 00:00:49.166
This is the sin of the old minister

17
00:00:49.366 --> 00:00:52.233
In vain, the emperor punished me severely

18
00:00:54.966 --> 00:00:58.166
Father, it is obvious that this matter has nothing to do with the Dong family

19
00:00:58.166 --> 00:00:59.400
Therefore, it cannot be severely punished.

20
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:00.233
Dong Shangshu

21
00:01:00.933 --> 00:01:02.066
Please get up.

22
00:01:02.133 --> 00:01:03.400
That being the case

23
00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:06.633
Suspend the responsibility for love

24
00:01:07.566 --> 00:01:09.633
Waiting for Xuntiansi to find out the truth

25
00:01:10.166 --> 00:01:11.600
Dispose of it again

26
00:01:12.266 --> 00:01:14.500
Forget it, the emperor will capture it

27
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.566
The old minister will also sue the princess and Wang Xun

28
00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.966
Slander King Liang and important ministers in the court

29
00:01:22.166 --> 00:01:23.766
Will be severely punished

30
00:01:24.366 --> 00:01:27.333
You said that I slandered King Liang and important court officials

31
00:01:27.333 --> 00:01:28.400
Exactly.

32
00:01:28.666 --> 00:01:32.633
You just kept saying that it was King Liang and the old minister

33
00:01:32.866 --> 00:01:35.766
Make Zhao Santong commit suicide, princess

34
00:01:35.933 --> 00:01:38.566
In fact, you don't have any evidence.

35
00:01:38.566 --> 00:01:39.966
It's not slander.

36
00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.300
What is it?

37
00:01:42.733 --> 00:01:43.600
Hey

38
00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.100
You slandered this king

39
00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.600
But it is the emperor who is damaged

40
00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.866
The reputation of home and the majesty of the court

41
00:01:51.766 --> 00:01:53.233
Please punish the father severely

42
00:01:53.266 --> 00:01:56.033
Please punish the emperor severely
