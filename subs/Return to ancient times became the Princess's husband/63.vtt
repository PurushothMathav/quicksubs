1
00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:02.066
Somebody drag it down

2
00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:04.066
Make a decision

3
00:00:04.066 --> 00:00:07.800
Wait, Emperor, I haven't despised it yet

4
00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:10.066
How can you judge me to lose?

5
00:00:10.133 --> 00:00:11.633
How does that compare?

6
00:00:11.966 --> 00:00:13.800
That's a kitchen knife.

7
00:00:13.966 --> 00:00:16.833
Can you defeat Dong Qiang's peerless sword?

8
00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.100
I regret it.

9
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.233
I also accompanied you here for a long time

10
00:00:22.766 --> 00:00:24.766
Drag down phoenix

11
00:00:25.866 --> 00:00:28.633
If you want him to die, you have to give him something to say

12
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.000
Or let them try

13
00:00:32.166 --> 00:00:34.733
Father, let him try

14
00:00:34.733 --> 00:00:36.533
Death sooner or later is death

15
00:00:36.533 --> 00:00:38.900
Why rush for a moment and a half?

16
00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:39.700
Humph

17
00:00:40.166 --> 00:00:41.066
OK

18
00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.233
Let's start comparing

19
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.400
My sword can blow hair off

20
00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.033
Is your knife okay?

21
00:00:51.166 --> 00:00:52.033
No.

22
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.533
You lose and die

23
00:00:54.533 --> 00:00:56.000
Hey, hey, wait a minute.

24
00:00:56.766 --> 00:00:59.800
The battlefield is a fight with real swords and real guns

25
00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.433
It's not a hair-blowing contest.

26
00:01:02.933 --> 00:01:05.066
The toughness of the first section of the bending steel is not enough

27
00:01:05.066 --> 00:01:06.100
Break as soon as you cut

28
00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:07.066
Top ass

29
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.966
Then you mean to cut it right?

30
00:01:10.166 --> 00:01:12.400
Tell me if you dare or not.

31
00:01:12.666 --> 00:01:16.233
My sword has cut through hundreds of private blades

32
00:01:16.366 --> 00:01:18.500
I'm also afraid of your broken kitchen knife

33
00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.233
Come on

34
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.433
Or you cut me

35
00:01:23.066 --> 00:01:25.333
This will cut your knife off in a while

36
00:01:25.333 --> 00:01:28.400
Don't say I took advantage of you
