00:00:00.666 --> 00:00:03.866
Wang Xun, didn't you say you wanted to bring down the Dong family?

2
00:00:03.866 --> 00:00:05.766
People are more profound

3
00:00:05.766 --> 00:00:07.066
Slap in the face

4
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.533
Princess, we will attack immediately

5
00:00:09.533 --> 00:00:12.266
Go get that weapon bureau back

6
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.800
Grab it back, what do you grab?

7
00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:17.600
Could it be that you have a better way to forge swords?

8
00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:20.533
Yes, I did have a knife.

9
00:00:20.533 --> 00:00:23.033
And sharper than Dong Qiang's knife

10
00:00:23.466 --> 00:00:25.233
Are you sure you're not kidding?

11
00:00:26.133 --> 00:00:29.366
If you can't beat the princess and cut me

12
00:00:29.366 --> 00:00:31.533
Hey, is that what you said?

13
00:00:31.533 --> 00:00:33.700
Don't regret it then

14
00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:42.666
Zhang Ning, what's the matter with you asking to see me?

15
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.866
Back to his father, Wang Xun held a knife

16
00:00:45.866 --> 00:00:48.066
Descended to Dong Gongzi I

17
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.866
Good emperor

18
00:00:49.866 --> 00:00:52.800
The knife I live with is stronger than anyone else's

19
00:00:53.066 --> 00:00:54.400
Hahahaha

20
00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.700
Wang Xun, my method of forging swords

21
00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:59.600
From the world's first sword master Ou

22
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.700
How dare you compete with me

23
00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:04.600
Tell me if you dare or not.

24
00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:05.900
What am I afraid of?

25
00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:06.800
If I lose

26
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.100
Give you the position of Admiral of the Arms Bureau if you lose

27
00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:11.366
I want your life

28
00:01:11.366 --> 00:01:13.566
OK, that's a deal.

29
00:01:13.866 --> 00:01:16.800
If the knife you live with can go beyond the wall

30
00:01:17.066 --> 00:01:20.500
I will make you the Admiral of the Ordnance Bureau
