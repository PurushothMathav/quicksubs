00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.866
What conditions do you want me to promise you?

2
00:00:03.866 --> 00:00:05.166
What about the first condition?

3
00:00:05.166 --> 00:00:06.633
I hope the emperor will issue a decree

4
00:00:06.866 --> 00:00:09.133
Anything manufactured by the Duke's Mansion in the future

5
00:00:09.133 --> 00:00:11.566
No one is allowed to forge or fabricate

6
00:00:12.266 --> 00:00:15.200
And the Duke's Mansion is exclusive

7
00:00:15.566 --> 00:00:16.600
This is simple.

8
00:00:16.766 --> 00:00:18.366
I can issue an order immediately

9
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.066
You said the second condition

10
00:00:20.266 --> 00:00:21.833
Uh emperor

11
00:00:21.966 --> 00:00:23.566
Is this the second condition?

12
00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.833
I hope the emperor will marry the princess to his courtiers

13
00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:33.400
Presumptuous, you stinky beggar of unknown origin

14
00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.466
Are you even worthy of marrying a princess?

15
00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.266
Hmph, you are innocent

16
00:00:38.333 --> 00:00:42.366
You bring me a hundred thousand knives

17
00:00:42.533 --> 00:00:43.500
The emperor calms down

18
00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:44.833
I knew I was wrong.

19
00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:47.666
I promise you

20
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.000
Two months later.

21
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.066
Hand in hand

22
00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.633
hand-in-hand

23
00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.166
100,000 the saber in place

24
00:00:56.333 --> 00:00:57.266
you

25
00:00:57.866 --> 00:00:59.166
Get married immediately

26
00:00:59.166 --> 00:01:02.366
It is the emperor who will live up to expectations

27
00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.100
Wang Xuan, you are so brave

28
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.833
How dare you threaten your father in this way?

29
00:01:08.933 --> 00:01:10.800
Marry me to you

30
00:01:10.866 --> 00:01:12.000
Empty heart road

31
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.933
I'll just say it casually

32
00:01:13.933 --> 00:01:16.100
I didn't expect the emperor to really agree

33
00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.900
i

34
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.966
Now that I think about it, I still regret it.

35
00:01:21.366 --> 00:01:24.900
Uh, I'll ask the emperor to take back his life now

36
00:01:25.666 --> 00:01:27.433
Even if you turn around

37
00:01:27.566 --> 00:01:28.833
I suspect it's you

38
00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.400
You come back to me

39
00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.266
If you dare to step out of my house

40
00:01:33.266 --> 00:01:34.766
I will cut you

41
00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.300
What are your plans?

42
00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.300
This 100,000 knife is not a small amount
