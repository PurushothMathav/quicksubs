1
00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:01.633
Go away

2
00:00:02.166 --> 00:00:02.900
Princess

3
00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:05.200
Do you know why the emperor complimented me today?

4
00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:08.233
Well, you can cure him with clear soup

5
00:00:08.266 --> 00:00:10.000
Of course he's going to praise you. Wrong

6
00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.600
Because I can see that the emperor does not want to punish King Liang

7
00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:15.266
And he really appreciated it.

8
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.100
Appreciating King Liang is going to kill him

9
00:00:19.733 --> 00:00:20.966
No poison no husband

10
00:00:21.366 --> 00:00:22.933
The emperor is also such a person

11
00:00:22.933 --> 00:00:24.933
Even more ruthless than Yama

12
00:00:24.933 --> 00:00:28.800
Think about it, if the emperor passes the throne to Yama

13
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.100
Wouldn't he be more at ease?

14
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.966
If I were to execute two people today

15
00:00:37.733 --> 00:00:39.866
The death must be

16
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:41.900
Demon

17
00:00:45.566 --> 00:00:46.900
Lucky to have you

18
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.766
Otherwise, the consequences will be unimaginable

19
00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.500
So dangerous, so dangerous

20
00:00:59.733 --> 00:01:02.433
I didn't expect that Wang Xun would let me go

21
00:01:02.533 --> 00:01:04.200
Otherwise this king will be finished

22
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:05.466
Your Highness, you are wrong

23
00:01:05.466 --> 00:01:06.866
It's not that Wang Xun let you go

24
00:01:06.866 --> 00:01:08.800
But the emperor let you go

25
00:01:08.966 --> 00:01:11.600
Wang Xun only saw through the emperor's thoughts

26
00:01:12.133 --> 00:01:13.633
Father let me go

27
00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.466
Why? Because you're cruel

28
00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.000
For the sake of ascendancy, even the emperor's life can be sacrificed

29
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.300
In the eyes of the emperor

30
00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:22.000
See

31
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.300
It is your ruthlessness and means to be a king

32
00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:26.466
So?

33
00:01:27.066 --> 00:01:29.700
Father has agreed that I will inherit the throne

34
00:01:29.733 --> 00:01:31.266
As it should be

35
00:01:31.266 --> 00:01:33.400
So I didn't punish you.

36
00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:37.000
So as not to overcome the stain for you in the future

37
00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.600
But don't be too happy, Prince

38
00:01:39.733 --> 00:01:41.866
Wang Xu is scheming

39
00:01:41.866 --> 00:01:43.400
If you make him a prince

40
00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.466
It will be a scourge in the future

41
00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.266
So we have to root as soon as possible

42
00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:53.033
I'll ask him if he can't see the sun tomorrow.
