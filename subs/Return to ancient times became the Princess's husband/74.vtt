Princess, did you know that there are green plants in the sea?

2
00:00:03.166 --> 00:00:04.066
It's called kelp.

3
00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:06.333
I know, that stuff is fishy

4
00:00:06.333 --> 00:00:07.800
This is what the poor eat

5
00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.666
Normally, it is used to feed pigs.

6
00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:12.100
Soak the kelp in water for a few days

7
00:00:12.133 --> 00:00:14.133
White crystals are obtained by evaporation and drying

8
00:00:14.133 --> 00:00:16.300
That thing is called sodium glutamate.

9
00:00:16.333 --> 00:00:19.166
This sodium glutamate with some salt is called monosodium glutamate

10
00:00:19.166 --> 00:00:20.566
That's it.

11
00:00:21.666 --> 00:00:24.666
Well, how do you know everything? Of course

12
00:00:24.666 --> 00:00:26.300
I am a doctor

13
00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.300
Then this is for you three times a day.

14
00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:30.233
Three capsules at a time

15
00:00:30.533 --> 00:00:31.766
What is this?

16
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.900
This nourishes yin, satiety and kidneys

17
00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:36.966
You must remember to finish eating uh

18
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.866
Why did he buy me a pesticide?

19
00:00:44.566 --> 00:00:45.700
I still need to charge

20
00:00:46.366 --> 00:00:47.800
Well, never mind

21
00:00:49.666 --> 00:00:51.500
Have some acacia

22
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:54.600
Let him eat it tonight

23
00:00:54.766 --> 00:00:56.166
Promise to let him seduce me

24
00:00:56.166 --> 00:00:56.966
Baidu

25
00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.000
Bring some baby by the way

26
00:01:00.166 --> 00:01:01.200
Successful crossing

27
00:01:03.133 --> 00:01:06.966
So I can become the richest man in the world
