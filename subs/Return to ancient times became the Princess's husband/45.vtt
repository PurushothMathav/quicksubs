00:00:01.133 --> 00:00:03.100
Wang Xun, what are you singing?

2
00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:04.066
nondescript

3
00:00:04.066 --> 00:00:06.633
How can the drama in the hook bar be better?

4
00:00:07.066 --> 00:00:08.166
Yes, I like it very much.

5
00:00:08.166 --> 00:00:09.366
Very creative.

6
00:00:09.466 --> 00:00:11.433
I am also a princess

7
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:12.400
This

8
00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:14.500
What about this flower?

9
00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:16.966
You only give the princess one flower

10
00:00:17.066 --> 00:00:19.133
Is there anyone more stingy than you in the world?

11
00:00:19.133 --> 00:00:22.033
I don't think you put the princess in your eyes at all

12
00:00:22.066 --> 00:00:25.400
This is called loving only one person for a lifetime

13
00:00:28.566 --> 00:00:31.366
Princess Wang Xueben will spare you this time

14
00:00:31.366 --> 00:00:32.900
If there is a next time

15
00:00:32.966 --> 00:00:34.433
Just pull out your tongue

16
00:00:34.566 --> 00:00:38.566
Is it a princess? Sure enough, singing and sending flowers is effective.

17
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.833
Next is the dinner treat

18
00:00:42.333 --> 00:00:43.900
Too bad I can't watch the movie

19
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.466
Otherwise it might be open tonight

20
00:00:47.566 --> 00:00:50.766
Then I can go out and play hahaha.

21
00:00:50.766 --> 00:00:53.033
Calamity is approaching without knowing it

22
00:00:53.266 --> 00:00:56.266
Dong Qiang, how dare you?

23
00:00:56.266 --> 00:00:58.100
How dare you trespass into the Duke's Mansion

24
00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.466
The princess comes to the Duke's Mansion more often, but the emperor said

25
00:01:02.466 --> 00:01:05.800
And the bold one, it's not me, it's him.

26
00:01:05.866 --> 00:01:08.533
Dong Gun, I didn't provoke you, don't bite me

27
00:01:08.533 --> 00:01:10.333
You really didn't mess with me

28
00:01:10.333 --> 00:01:12.366
But you poisoned the emperor

29
00:01:12.366 --> 00:01:13.566
Don't spill blood

30
00:01:13.566 --> 00:01:15.200
How could I have poisoned the emperor?

31
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.600
Poison or not, you know it yourself

32
00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:19.533
The emperor ate the meal you cooked

33
00:01:19.533 --> 00:01:20.966
I will have unbearable abdominal pain when I go back

34
00:01:20.966 --> 00:01:22.366
Who else could it be?

35
00:01:22.366 --> 00:01:23.300
Yeah, no way.

36
00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:25.400
What could possibly be wrong with my cooking?

37
00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:26.600
Is it possible

38
00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.700
Go down and talk to Yama, take it down
