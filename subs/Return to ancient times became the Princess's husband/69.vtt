00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:01.400
brother

2
00:00:03.166 --> 00:00:05.400
How dare you sell such immoral things?

3
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.300
The face of the Duke's Mansion has made you lose everything

4
00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:09.833
If you have the ability, you can sell it too.

5
00:00:10.666 --> 00:00:11.466
Humph

6
00:00:11.933 --> 00:00:13.166
Anyway.

7
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.900
Our deal is 2 million two

8
00:00:15.133 --> 00:00:17.500
Now you lose.

9
00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.166
In fact, I lost on purpose

10
00:00:19.166 --> 00:00:21.633
Because I don't want a son like you

11
00:00:22.466 --> 00:00:25.666
And it doesn't matter if you lose

12
00:00:25.666 --> 00:00:28.866
I didn't say what the punishment was, shut up

13
00:00:30.866 --> 00:00:31.666
go down

14
00:00:36.566 --> 00:00:38.700
You go down too

15
00:00:41.666 --> 00:00:42.466
Wang Xun

16
00:00:43.666 --> 00:00:45.000
Tell me the truth.

17
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.566
Where did you get your money from?

18
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.466
You can't sell this dress. You can sell 300,000 two

19
00:00:50.466 --> 00:00:52.466
Oops princess

20
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.533
In fact, you can't sell this dress for so much money.

21
00:00:56.533 --> 00:00:59.800
But selling patents is not necessarily the case.

22
00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:01.300
patent

23
00:01:02.366 --> 00:01:04.400
What is it?

24
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.566
I have issued an edict to the emperor

25
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.100
This kind of thing can only be produced by me

26
00:01:09.266 --> 00:01:12.000
Anyone who produces it privately counts as resistance

27
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.700
Fine

28
00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:14.866
heavy house raiding

29
00:01:14.866 --> 00:01:17.066
Unless there is my patent authorization

30
00:01:18.666 --> 00:01:19.866
And?

31
00:01:19.966 --> 00:01:21.766
Then I took him to the Cosmopolitan Chamber of Commerce

32
00:01:21.766 --> 00:01:24.266
They are deeply impressed by my clothes

33
00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:26.133
And it took 300,000

34
00:01:26.133 --> 00:01:27.466
Bought my patent license

35
00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:29.100
na

36
00:01:29.566 --> 00:01:31.233
This is our walnut.

37
00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:36.600
Then this dress

38
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.866
What good is it?

39
00:01:41.366 --> 00:01:45.300
Well, I can't explain it clearly.

40
00:01:45.766 --> 00:01:50.466
Princess, why don't you try it and I'll help you be presumptuous
