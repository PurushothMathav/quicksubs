00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:01.166
MSG

2
00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:03.266
What is this?

3
00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:06.500
Well, it's a godsend.

4
00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:07.900
The ingredients are incredibly complex.

5
00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:09.266
Hundreds of species

6
00:00:09.266 --> 00:00:12.533
And it has gone through 99810 processes.

7
00:00:12.533 --> 00:00:15.100
It takes more than three years to refine

8
00:00:15.333 --> 00:00:17.400
Put it in any dish

9
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.300
Can be turned into a delicious meal

10
00:00:19.466 --> 00:00:22.200
Then why don't you give the MSG to Dewang soon?

11
00:00:22.266 --> 00:00:24.766
This king wants to cook for his father every day

12
00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.066
How can such a precious thing be easily hummed to you?

13
00:00:29.466 --> 00:00:31.900
How much do you want? I can't afford it

14
00:00:33.966 --> 00:00:37.100
Ah a little broken bag

15
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.800
You actually want a thousand taels?

16
00:00:40.066 --> 00:00:41.200
Not a thousand taels

17
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.033
Could it be that you want 10,000 taels of me?

18
00:00:45.333 --> 00:00:47.000
10,000 taels won't do.

19
00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:48.600
let go

20
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.466
10,000 taels is not enough.

21
00:00:50.466 --> 00:00:51.866
Could it be that you want a million taels?

22
00:00:51.866 --> 00:00:52.666
But

23
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:54.866
Good fifty thousand taels

24
00:00:54.866 --> 00:00:55.966
I won't give you any more.

25
00:00:55.966 --> 00:00:58.200
I mean one hundred taels.

26
00:01:02.566 --> 00:01:04.000
King Liang's Filial Piety

27
00:01:04.333 --> 00:01:06.300
It's so touching.

28
00:01:06.366 --> 00:01:07.166
Wang Xun

29
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.400
You cook well

30
00:01:09.566 --> 00:01:10.500
Go ahead.

31
00:01:11.133 --> 00:01:13.200
What do you want me to reward you with?

32
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.866
Great, great.

33
00:01:15.866 --> 00:01:17.700
Here comes the chance to be the concubine
