00:00:01.166 --> 00:00:02.033
Can't find Wang Xun

2
00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:03.800
You bring your head up to see Wang Xun

3
00:00:04.166 --> 00:00:06.766
You don't deceive too much

4
00:00:06.766 --> 00:00:08.166
I'm just going to deceive people too much

5
00:00:08.166 --> 00:00:10.233
What's wrong with you?

6
00:00:12.733 --> 00:00:14.833
I beg you to come back with me

7
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.866
Even a little Wang Xun can't handle it

8
00:00:21.866 --> 00:00:23.666
You make this king lose face

9
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:25.466
Aren't you resourceful?

10
00:00:25.466 --> 00:00:26.766
Think of a way

11
00:00:26.766 --> 00:00:28.600
This king wants Wang Xun to die

12
00:00:29.366 --> 00:00:31.133
Your Highness, this is simple

13
00:00:31.133 --> 00:00:33.533
Send a killer at night to kill it directly

14
00:00:33.533 --> 00:00:36.766
Confused, you rushed to the Duke's Mansion to kill people today

15
00:00:36.766 --> 00:00:38.900
Do you dare to enter the palace tomorrow?

16
00:00:41.066 --> 00:00:43.700
This matter still needs to be treated

17
00:00:44.766 --> 00:00:47.966
Does the emperor often like to go to the Duke's Mansion to eat?

18
00:00:47.966 --> 00:00:50.566
We can write articles on this.

19
00:00:50.566 --> 00:00:53.233
If we do it well

20
00:00:53.333 --> 00:00:57.166
That's him, Wang Xun has 100 brains
