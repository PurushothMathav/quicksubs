00:00:00.666 --> 00:00:01.800
Fortunately, my spirit

2
00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:03.300
Let me be happy today

3
00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:21.100
Wang Xu

4
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.433
Where are you going?

5
00:00:23.766 --> 00:00:26.533
Why do you want to do something and run away?

6
00:00:26.533 --> 00:00:28.266
What does it matter to you where I go?

7
00:00:28.266 --> 00:00:30.466
You offended the two kings, and you still want to run away

8
00:00:30.466 --> 00:00:33.400
Don't forget that I'm the head guard of the Duke's Mansion

9
00:00:33.733 --> 00:00:36.600
If you catch me, I won't be afraid of what the princess will pursue

10
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.833
Hahaha Wang Xu

11
00:00:38.933 --> 00:00:41.400
No one knows you here.

12
00:00:41.766 --> 00:00:45.666
How did the princess know that you were caught by me?

13
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.900
It's good to be killed by Zhao Santong

14
00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.033
So the guard is the same as you

15
00:00:53.466 --> 00:00:54.700
It's mine.

16
00:00:59.266 --> 00:01:01.300
What about the princess?

17
00:01:01.766 --> 00:01:03.500
No trash caught

18
00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.166
You can't even catch a Wang Xun

19
00:01:05.566 --> 00:01:07.233
Get off, princess

20
00:01:07.333 --> 00:01:08.700
It's not that I can't catch him

21
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.766
But he was captured by Zhao Santong

22
00:01:11.966 --> 00:01:14.500
What was taken away by Zhao Santong?
