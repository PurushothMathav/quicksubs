00:00:02.133 --> 00:00:03.166
Bold thief

2
00:00:03.166 --> 00:00:04.000
Who killed you?

3
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Princess forgive me

4
00:00:05.733 --> 00:00:06.533
This

5
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:10.200
You just asked me to come in and rub your back

6
00:00:10.666 --> 00:00:13.100
I dare not defy your mission

7
00:00:15.066 --> 00:00:15.866
roll

8
00:00:18.333 --> 00:00:20.200
I took advantage of you dog thief

9
00:00:22.366 --> 00:00:22.766
Man

10
00:00:22.766 --> 00:00:25.800
Ask how many cockroaches you fuck and where I got it back

11
00:00:27.533 --> 00:00:30.566
Where can I find such poems?

12
00:00:30.566 --> 00:00:33.000
Poems that use spring as a chess game are not easy to write

13
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.933
Spring sleep

14
00:00:34.933 --> 00:00:38.466
I hear the sound of birds singing everywhere

15
00:00:38.466 --> 00:00:40.766
How much do you know about flowers falling?

16
00:00:41.066 --> 00:00:43.266
I said you ancients really haven't seen each other

17
00:00:43.266 --> 00:00:46.300
Even the famous Chunxiao doesn't know

18
00:00:46.333 --> 00:00:48.133
Then I'll let you learn a lot.

19
00:00:48.133 --> 00:00:51.400
Let me give you another song of Queqiao Xian

20
00:00:52.733 --> 00:00:56.066
Xianyunnong Bridge Flying Star Hate

21
00:00:56.066 --> 00:00:58.366
Silver man far and dark

22
00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.800
Golden wind and jade dew meet

23
00:01:00.933 --> 00:01:03.366
There are countless victories in the world

24
00:01:03.866 --> 00:01:05.833
Good things are urgent

25
00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:10.033
Are you in a hurry?

26
00:01:12.666 --> 00:01:16.100
Remember these two poems were written by my young master Dong

27
00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.300
Who dares to talk nonsense outside?

28
00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.100
Block your heads

29
00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.566
Brother Long Brother Long

30
00:01:22.566 --> 00:01:23.500
Oh brother long

31
00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.100
Do you remember where you caught me?

32
00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:26.766
I'll get my stuff back first

33
00:01:26.766 --> 00:01:29.266
Is the emperor choosing a father for the princess in the main hall?

34
00:01:29.266 --> 00:01:30.633
I don't have time to mess around with you

35
00:01:30.766 --> 00:01:32.766
Do I choose my father?

36
00:01:32.766 --> 00:01:34.566
Then my chance has come

37
00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.166
As long as you become the concubine

38
00:01:36.166 --> 00:01:37.300
Sleeping princess

39
00:01:37.333 --> 00:01:38.966
I can travel back in time
