00:00:02.933 --> 00:00:04.800
You have disappointed me so much.

2
00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:05.900
resurrection

3
00:00:06.533 --> 00:00:07.333
son

4
00:00:08.133 --> 00:00:09.833
The son knew he was wrong.

5
00:00:09.866 --> 00:00:11.366
The son is confused

6
00:00:11.366 --> 00:00:14.233
Father, please let my son not die

7
00:00:14.366 --> 00:00:16.433
Dong Wen asked you to kill

8
00:00:16.733 --> 00:00:18.433
Come to a dead witness

9
00:00:18.533 --> 00:00:22.033
Hmph, his idea really stinks

10
00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:25.133
But if you really do

11
00:00:25.133 --> 00:00:28.500
I may not inherit the throne to you

12
00:00:29.066 --> 00:00:32.233
The plan Wang Xun gave you is the best policy

13
00:00:32.766 --> 00:00:33.666
pity

14
00:00:34.466 --> 00:00:36.033
You are indecisive

15
00:00:36.133 --> 00:00:37.400
refuse to decide

16
00:00:38.166 --> 00:00:39.266
And he was right.

17
00:00:40.333 --> 00:00:42.566
You can be a good emperor

18
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.466
Let the people of the world be well

19
00:00:45.466 --> 00:00:48.466
Even if I swear to kill my father

20
00:00:48.966 --> 00:00:52.100
The people of the world will love you too

21
00:00:52.966 --> 00:00:53.966
he

22
00:00:55.133 --> 00:00:57.033
I know better than you how to be an emperor

23
00:00:57.933 --> 00:01:00.100
Phoenix, he asked his second brother to kill you

24
00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.000
How can you still speak for him?

25
00:01:02.533 --> 00:01:03.633
You misunderstood.

26
00:01:03.733 --> 00:01:05.633
This is what we negotiated.

27
00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:07.600
Just to test him

28
00:01:07.866 --> 00:01:10.066
Is it suitable to be this emperor?

29
00:01:10.366 --> 00:01:12.466
Your Majesty, with all due respect

30
00:01:12.866 --> 00:01:15.733
The heir you've been looking for is as suspicious as you are

31
00:01:15.733 --> 00:01:16.533
resolutely

32
00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:20.000
But your problem of being bigger than the world is full of problems

33
00:01:20.066 --> 00:01:23.400
Even in the competition between countries

34
00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.400
You might as well change your perspective.

35
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.266
Find a loyal and honest Ming Army reporter

36
00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.033
You are saying that I am not a good emperor
