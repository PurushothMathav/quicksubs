00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.166
Even immortals

2
00:00:02.866 --> 00:00:05.833
Can't save him either

3
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.500
Wang Jun, did you really make this knife?

4
00:00:13.133 --> 00:00:14.100
No.

5
00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.933
Then why did you take on the task of 100,000 knife?

6
00:00:17.933 --> 00:00:19.500
This is the crime of bullying the king

7
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.533
Princess, we should report to the emperor immediately

8
00:00:22.533 --> 00:00:23.800
Cut ties with him

9
00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:27.200
Otherwise, we will be implicated by him sooner or later.

10
00:00:27.766 --> 00:00:30.466
I mean, I didn't make this knife.

11
00:00:30.466 --> 00:00:32.400
I didn't say I couldn't cast.

12
00:00:34.266 --> 00:00:36.600
58 years of great change in steel

13
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.966
The small blast furnace used is very easy to prevent

14
00:00:42.566 --> 00:00:45.033
But with a knife and a piano

15
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.366
The knife that is beaten out will definitely exceed this kind of knife.

16
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.800
The katana of the island country uses these two words

17
00:00:51.133 --> 00:00:54.400
That's much sharper, recognized around the world

18
00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:56.200
Wang Xuan

19
00:00:56.333 --> 00:00:59.200
I can ignore you no matter how much you usually mess around.

20
00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.500
But this is serious.

21
00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.400
It's about the life and death of our big fish

22
00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:04.966
You can't have any wings

23
00:01:05.366 --> 00:01:07.900
Don't worry, the princess promises to complete the task.

24
00:01:10.733 --> 00:01:12.200
What does the emperor want to talk about?

25
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.166
Wang Xun's northern soldiers are in urgent need of supplies

26
00:01:16.266 --> 00:01:19.466
But Wang Xun has been the governor of the Arms Bureau for seven days

27
00:01:19.466 --> 00:01:21.766
Not even a single sword was forged

28
00:01:21.766 --> 00:01:23.433
This is clearly a deliberate delay

29
00:01:23.566 --> 00:01:26.666
So that I can be better than losing the northern warriors?

30
00:01:27.566 --> 00:01:28.366
Wang Xun

31
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.866
Are you really not even crafted for battle?

32
00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:32.900
Yes

33
00:01:33.733 --> 00:01:36.166
You'd better give me a reasonable explanation

34
00:01:36.166 --> 00:01:38.700
Otherwise I want your head
