00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.466
Well, there's less than a day left

2
00:00:02.466 --> 00:00:04.700
I want to see how you prepare

3
00:00:05.933 --> 00:00:08.100
Don't worry about it.

4
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:10.633
This father's acceptance is of great significance

5
00:00:10.933 --> 00:00:12.266
Are you really sure?

6
00:00:12.266 --> 00:00:14.933
Of course tomorrow if I'm ready to accept

7
00:00:14.933 --> 00:00:16.300
The emperor doesn't like it

8
00:00:16.366 --> 00:00:18.966
I'm good on the spot

9
00:00:18.966 --> 00:00:21.866
That's what you said, huh?

10
00:00:25.466 --> 00:00:26.500
Princess

11
00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:28.166
Why don't you go down?

12
00:00:28.166 --> 00:00:31.833
Princess, I have refined a bottle of rose essential oil for you.

13
00:00:32.666 --> 00:00:34.566
Rose essential oil

14
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.966
How to use it so fragrant

15
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Apply it to your body while bathing

16
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.833
Massage with special techniques

17
00:00:47.266 --> 00:00:50.933
After bathing, you will let your body smell its own fragrance

18
00:00:50.933 --> 00:00:52.866
The skin is delicate and smooth

19
00:00:52.866 --> 00:00:55.533
Hmm, what special technique?

20
00:00:55.533 --> 00:00:56.466
Is it useful?

21
00:00:56.466 --> 00:00:58.466
It's very profound.

22
00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:59.833
It's hard to describe.

23
00:01:00.466 --> 00:01:02.066
Princess or

24
00:01:02.366 --> 00:01:03.366
I'll serve you once.

25
00:01:03.366 --> 00:01:06.200
You are presumptuous

26
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.933
Believe it or not, I killed you on the spot, princess, believe me

27
00:01:08.933 --> 00:01:09.733
i

28
00:01:10.466 --> 00:01:12.166
I'll give you a massage.

29
00:01:12.166 --> 00:01:14.900
Only massage your hands, feet and back

30
00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:16.800
Big deal

31
00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.000
How small are these eyes?

32
00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.400
It can make the whole body fragrant

33
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.466
Why don't you just give it a try?

34
00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.300
Okay, don't you dare cross the line

35
00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:26.933
I'll kill you on the spot

36
00:01:26.933 --> 00:01:28.766
I must pique his interest

37
00:01:28.766 --> 00:01:30.566
As long as the relationship is successful

38
00:01:30.566 --> 00:01:32.866
I can travel back, don't worry, princess

39
00:01:32.866 --> 00:01:34.866
I must abide by my duty

40
00:01:42.133 --> 00:01:43.566
What are you doing with the sword?

41
00:01:43.866 --> 00:01:47.133
Of course, I'm afraid of being stabbed to death in your anger

42
00:01:47.133 --> 00:01:50.200
This sword will affect my performance

43
00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:51.866
Princess, don't get me wrong

44
00:01:51.866 --> 00:01:53.200
So let's get started.

45
00:01:54.166 --> 00:01:57.033
Then turn around and cover your eyes
