1
00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:03.200
I borrow money on condition.

2
00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:04.166
What kind of condition?

3
00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:07.666
5 points of strength

4
00:00:07.666 --> 00:00:11.100
And kneel down and kowtow to me a hundred times

5
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:14.500
Hahahaha, you see you are deceiving too much.

6
00:00:15.133 --> 00:00:16.566
The princess is wrong

7
00:00:16.666 --> 00:00:18.100
This is a deal.

8
00:00:18.266 --> 00:00:19.866
He can also refuse

9
00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.333
But if you can't get it out after two months

10
00:00:22.333 --> 00:00:23.933
100,000 a sword

11
00:00:23.933 --> 00:00:26.600
That's going to lose your head

12
00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.066
Who says we can't take it out?

13
00:00:28.166 --> 00:00:30.100
He has partnered with the Four Seas Chamber of Commerce

14
00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:32.900
We make 300,000 a day

15
00:00:33.133 --> 00:00:34.866
Just selling women's underwear

16
00:00:34.866 --> 00:00:37.300
What 300,000 two?

17
00:00:37.366 --> 00:00:40.200
You're 1.70 million

18
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.733
Let me tell you

19
00:00:41.733 --> 00:00:44.766
I have greeted all the banks in Jincheng

20
00:00:44.766 --> 00:00:46.733
No one will lend you money

21
00:00:46.733 --> 00:00:48.333
Hahahaha

22
00:00:48.333 --> 00:00:50.466
Duan Gongzi, you fool

23
00:00:51.066 --> 00:00:52.666
I said I would borrow money

24
00:00:52.933 --> 00:00:55.166
What if you don't borrow money?

25
00:00:55.166 --> 00:00:57.300
Kneel down and kowtow

26
00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.466
I'm considering less effort for you.

27
00:00:59.466 --> 00:01:00.800
Hahahaha

28
00:01:01.866 --> 00:01:03.400
Oh, by the way, Mr. Deng

29
00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:05.700
How does your MSG taste?

30
00:01:05.966 --> 00:01:09.366
Nice and fairly cheap.

31
00:01:09.466 --> 00:01:10.566
As long as

32
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.266
10,000 you sold to King Liang 50,000 two

33
00:01:15.266 --> 00:01:17.733
Presumably the cost is also indispensable

34
00:01:17.733 --> 00:01:20.766
Hahaha and other 10,000 taels in the large population

35
00:01:20.766 --> 00:01:23.133
But dozens of words, don't talk nonsense

36
00:01:23.133 --> 00:01:23.966
Learn to bark

37
00:01:23.966 --> 00:01:25.866
My son told me

38
00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.966
What are you talking about?

39
00:01:27.966 --> 00:01:29.566
How is that possible?

40
00:01:29.933 --> 00:01:31.200
Why not?

41
00:01:31.466 --> 00:01:34.233
I am the channel you said
