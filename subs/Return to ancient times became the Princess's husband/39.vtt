00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:01.133
Zhang Ning

2
00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:03.800
I haven't eaten anything fragrant recently.

3
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.166
The cook in your house is good

4
00:00:06.266 --> 00:00:08.466
I'll change the taste

5
00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:11.166
The son-in-law has been prepared for the father

6
00:00:15.333 --> 00:00:17.000
Bold Zhang Ning

7
00:00:17.333 --> 00:00:19.133
Father came to your house for dinner

8
00:00:19.133 --> 00:00:20.833
You only fried two dishes?

9
00:00:20.933 --> 00:00:23.566
Aren't you still persuading your father?

10
00:00:23.566 --> 00:00:26.866
And the emperor never eats salty food

11
00:00:26.866 --> 00:00:28.466
Both dishes are salty

12
00:00:28.466 --> 00:00:30.866
What's your heart, Zhang Ning?

13
00:00:32.266 --> 00:00:34.066
You have disappointed me so much.

14
00:00:34.066 --> 00:00:35.066
Father calm down

15
00:00:35.066 --> 00:00:35.933
Children are enough

16
00:00:35.933 --> 00:00:37.666
The cook in the house was injured

17
00:00:37.766 --> 00:00:39.500
Failure to cook

18
00:00:40.566 --> 00:00:41.966
The cook is not here

19
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.900
Who cooked that?

20
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.500
It's Wang Xun

21
00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.166
Emperor Wang Xun must have done it on purpose

22
00:00:50.166 --> 00:00:51.466
Ask the emperor to issue an order

23
00:00:51.466 --> 00:00:53.200
Kill Wang Xun immediately

24
00:00:53.466 --> 00:00:55.466
Yes, the power of heaven cannot be violated

25
00:00:55.466 --> 00:00:58.700
Don't kill, don't show your monarchy

26
00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:00.666
Bring Wang Xun up

27
00:01:00.666 --> 00:01:01.700
Don't shout

28
00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:02.900
I have come

29
00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:04.500
Wang Xun

30
00:01:05.066 --> 00:01:06.766
Your time has come to die

31
00:01:07.133 --> 00:01:09.466
Your Majesty, you haven't eaten this meal yet

32
00:01:09.466 --> 00:01:11.966
Why do you decide that the food is not delicious?
