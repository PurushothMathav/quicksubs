1
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:04.566
That's not possible.

2
00:00:05.133 --> 00:00:06.333
How is that possible?

3
00:00:06.333 --> 00:00:07.866
My peerless sword

4
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:10.100
I can't stop chopping your kitchen knife

5
00:00:10.166 --> 00:00:11.933
You are not a peerless knife

6
00:00:11.933 --> 00:00:14.300
It's junk.

7
00:00:16.766 --> 00:00:18.666
There is such a good knife in the world

8
00:00:18.666 --> 00:00:22.833
If this knife is turned into a war knife to equip the whole army

9
00:00:22.866 --> 00:00:26.033
Am I invincible if I am greater than that?

10
00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.966
Good to have such weapons

11
00:00:28.966 --> 00:00:32.200
Our army can definitely cut off the world

12
00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:37.300
Appoint Wang Xun to the Arms Bureau

13
00:00:37.766 --> 00:00:40.766
Build 100,000 knives in two months

14
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.033
No mistake, thank the emperor

15
00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:49.000
The duck that arrived in the mouth was actually robbed by Wang Xun

16
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.900
Your Highness, I am not reconciled

17
00:00:50.933 --> 00:00:53.633
I'm going to kill him with my own hands

18
00:00:56.066 --> 00:00:57.566
As soon as you load Wang Xun

19
00:00:58.133 --> 00:01:01.266
It can only make the emperor distrust Wang Ying even more

20
00:01:01.566 --> 00:01:03.266
The weak get angry

21
00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:06.866
The strong will only defeat their opponents domineering

22
00:01:08.466 --> 00:01:09.366
Go ahead.

23
00:01:09.933 --> 00:01:12.600
What's your new plan?

24
00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.500
Fuding draws new

25
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.900
What does it mean to be lucky to draw a new father? Please explain it clearly.

26
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.766
The announcement of complementarity is in the hands of the prince

27
00:01:23.933 --> 00:01:25.466
Don't give him money

28
00:01:25.466 --> 00:01:27.333
Don't forgive him

29
00:01:27.333 --> 00:01:28.300
Look at him.

30
00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:30.600
How to forge a sword

31
00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:34.733
If you can't make 100,000 knife in two months

32
00:01:34.733 --> 00:01:36.500
Delayed the northern warriors

33
00:01:36.566 --> 00:01:38.433
Hahahaha

34
00:01:38.666 --> 00:01:40.666
Even immortals

35
00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:44.266
Can't save him either
