00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.433
Princess, I came from the 21st century

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:04.800
Wang Xun

3
00:00:05.366 --> 00:00:06.266
When this palace presides over

4
00:00:06.266 --> 00:00:08.533
3-Year-olds can no longer afford not to tell the truth

5
00:00:08.533 --> 00:00:10.466
Kill without mercy I said

6
00:00:10.466 --> 00:00:12.700
It was actually brought by a friend of mine from overseas

7
00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:15.066
I don't know exactly where

8
00:00:15.733 --> 00:00:18.200
If you dare to play with this princess again

9
00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.100
I will make you die miserably

10
00:00:20.733 --> 00:00:23.100
Humph such a good wine

11
00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.000
The princess didn't drink it

12
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.266
Is that cheaper?

13
00:00:26.266 --> 00:00:27.966
He wanted to drink

14
00:00:28.266 --> 00:00:29.500
Get him drunk

15
00:00:29.666 --> 00:00:31.433
Don't I have a chance?

16
00:00:31.566 --> 00:00:32.566
Princess is not a pity

17
00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:33.966
I have another bottle here.

18
00:00:33.966 --> 00:00:36.666
Hmph, I can't believe that wine is really that good

19
00:00:36.666 --> 00:00:37.900
If the princess really wants to drink

20
00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:39.200
I'll go to the street and buy it for you.

21
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.566
Is it good to drink? Wait a minute?

22
00:00:43.066 --> 00:00:44.466
This is a glass bottle.

23
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:45.533
This is glass.

24
00:00:45.533 --> 00:00:48.133
It is more precious than glass, so what if the bottle looks good?

25
00:00:48.133 --> 00:00:50.166
Wine may not taste good

26
00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:54.600
Ah this wine

27
00:00:54.666 --> 00:00:56.100
Why is this wine so fragrant?
