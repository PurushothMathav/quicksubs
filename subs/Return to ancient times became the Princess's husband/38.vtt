00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.500
Princess, Dong Wen obviously compliments you

2
00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:04.866
Definitely some conspiracy

3
00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:06.366
There was no conspiracy.

4
00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:08.566
The emperor likes to eat the dishes cooked by Zhang Chuniang

5
00:00:08.566 --> 00:00:10.700
It's normal to dine with us

6
00:00:10.966 --> 00:00:12.666
Wait until I cut this dog thing first

7
00:00:12.666 --> 00:00:14.200
Go to Zhang Chuniang to prepare

8
00:00:15.533 --> 00:00:16.600
The princess is not good

9
00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.733
Zhang Chuniang was sent to find Commander Wang

10
00:00:18.733 --> 00:00:19.566
There was an accident.

11
00:00:19.566 --> 00:00:21.300
Now unconscious.

12
00:00:21.366 --> 00:00:24.633
What Zhang Chuniang was unconscious?

13
00:00:25.266 --> 00:00:26.066
This

14
00:00:26.566 --> 00:00:28.400
What if I don't go tomorrow?

15
00:00:28.733 --> 00:00:29.666
Dog stuff

16
00:00:29.766 --> 00:00:32.000
Zhang Chuniang, if it weren't for your injury

17
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:33.366
How come?

18
00:00:34.566 --> 00:00:36.400
Slow down princess

19
00:00:36.466 --> 00:00:37.633
I can cook.

20
00:00:38.333 --> 00:00:39.300
Braised Cantonese Cuisine

21
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.000
Northeast cuisine, especially Sichuan cuisine, I am proficient in everything

22
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:44.800
Please, princess, give me a chance

23
00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.300
What I'm cooking tomorrow

24
00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:49.000
Absolutely let the emperor lick the plate and talk

25
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:50.566
But

26
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.166
The recent Phoenix has a bad appetite.

27
00:00:54.166 --> 00:00:55.600
You can't eat sweets.

28
00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:56.900
You can't eat salty food.

29
00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:59.666
You can't eat hemp and you can't eat spicy food.

30
00:00:59.666 --> 00:01:00.900
Sour doesn't work either.

31
00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.166
Are you sure you can satisfy your parents?

32
00:01:04.333 --> 00:01:06.666
You can always eat something light

33
00:01:07.166 --> 00:01:07.966
Humph

34
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.166
Once upon a time, there was a royal chef

35
00:01:11.166 --> 00:01:14.400
Made a bowl of cooked cabbage with eggs for the emperor

36
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.466
He was beheaded on the spot

37
00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:19.866
drag it down

38
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.433
Oh princess

39
00:01:21.533 --> 00:01:22.933
Please give me a chance

40
00:01:22.933 --> 00:01:24.300
What I'm cooking tomorrow

41
00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:25.966
If the emperor cannot be satisfied

42
00:01:25.966 --> 00:01:26.966
I forbade myself on the spot

43
00:01:26.966 --> 00:01:28.166
Never let you do it

44
00:01:28.166 --> 00:01:31.066
Okay, that's what you said.
