1
00:00:00.933 --> 00:00:01.900
we

2
00:00:04.166 --> 00:00:05.266
screwed up

3
00:00:06.733 --> 00:00:10.433
Maybe the body has been delivered to the emperor

4
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:11.600
Don't panic, sir

5
00:00:11.933 --> 00:00:14.100
I have plans

6
00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:15.600
What arrangement?

7
00:00:15.666 --> 00:00:18.100
We will know tomorrow

8
00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:20.966
Not only can you turn bad luck into good luck

9
00:00:21.066 --> 00:00:22.466
save the day

10
00:00:22.666 --> 00:00:26.966
And they all bitten the Duke's Mansion fiercely

11
00:00:27.166 --> 00:00:29.366
Moment with Wang Xun

12
00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:33.400
Zhang Ning was clamoring to see me in the morning

13
00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:34.766
So-called what

14
00:00:35.066 --> 00:00:38.700
Last night, the son of the emperor was assassinated in the mansion

15
00:00:38.766 --> 00:00:40.700
I almost didn't see my father

16
00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:43.200
What was assassinated?

17
00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:44.600
Who did it?

18
00:00:45.366 --> 00:00:46.633
Are you hurt?

19
00:00:46.933 --> 00:00:48.300
You are Zhao Santong

20
00:00:48.466 --> 00:00:50.900
Fortunately, Wang Xun had a good escort last night

21
00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.300
Otherwise, you won't be able to see my son

22
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:54.766
What to dance to kill

23
00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.066
That's Dong Shang's family general, right?

24
00:00:58.266 --> 00:01:00.300
Good emperor

25
00:01:00.533 --> 00:01:04.233
We believe that this assassination is what the Dong family claims

26
00:01:04.266 --> 00:01:07.400
And the Dong family was also instructed by others

27
00:01:08.766 --> 00:01:10.366
Why are you looking at this king?

28
00:01:10.366 --> 00:01:12.100
Could it be that he doubts this king?

29
00:01:12.366 --> 00:01:13.866
I'll see what you do.

30
00:01:13.866 --> 00:01:15.133
If you hadn't done it

31
00:01:15.133 --> 00:01:16.233
What are you nervous about?

32
00:01:16.466 --> 00:01:19.133
Did you do this, King Liang?

33
00:01:19.133 --> 00:01:20.633
You recruit from the truth
