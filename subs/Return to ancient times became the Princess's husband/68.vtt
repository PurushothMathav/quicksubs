00:00:00.533 --> 00:00:02.266
What are your plans?

2
00:00:02.466 --> 00:00:05.266
This 100,000 knife is not a small amount

3
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.333
I'm going to sell clothes to raise money

4
00:00:07.333 --> 00:00:10.166
Buy the iron pillar knife after raising the money

5
00:00:10.166 --> 00:00:11.966
Hum a joke

6
00:00:12.133 --> 00:00:15.000
100,000 at least 2 million knife

7
00:00:15.133 --> 00:00:17.166
Wait until you sell clothes to raise money

8
00:00:17.166 --> 00:00:19.100
I'm afraid it will take hundreds of years.

9
00:00:19.966 --> 00:00:21.300
Not for hundreds of years

10
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:22.500
Just tomorrow.

11
00:00:23.366 --> 00:00:25.666
If you can get 2 million tomorrow

12
00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:27.566
I can be your own son

13
00:00:27.566 --> 00:00:30.966
Ok, it's a deal, hum

14
00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:33.966
Caiyun

15
00:00:34.666 --> 00:00:36.566
How much is the difference?

16
00:00:36.566 --> 00:00:38.766
Now we only have 130,000 two

17
00:00:38.866 --> 00:00:40.000
Still missing

18
00:00:41.566 --> 00:00:43.200
1.87 million two

19
00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:45.300
Really can't

20
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.400
Just sell this work uniform.

21
00:00:52.066 --> 00:00:53.400
Why buy princess clothes?

22
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.566
Sold where do we live

23
00:00:56.533 --> 00:00:57.766
You have the nerve to say

24
00:00:57.766 --> 00:00:59.300
It's not to raise money for you

25
00:00:59.533 --> 00:01:00.800
Raise money for me

26
00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.300
Don't you want to buy raw casting knives with money?

27
00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.100
Our princess sold everything she could

28
00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:08.800
Now only this princess dress is left

29
00:01:09.466 --> 00:01:12.300
Princess, I didn't expect you to be so kind to me.

30
00:01:12.566 --> 00:01:15.633
Princess, he is not worth it at all

31
00:01:15.866 --> 00:01:17.000
Let me slash him

32
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.166
One hundred and one

33
00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.800
The princess doesn't actually need to sell this work dress

34
00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.066
200 cars.

35
00:01:22.366 --> 00:01:23.300
It's easy to earn.

36
00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:27.000
And I've been selling this for 300,000 years

37
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.966
I can do the rest

38
00:01:31.466 --> 00:01:33.466
What kind of clothes do you sell?

39
00:01:33.466 --> 00:01:35.300
You can make 300,000

40
00:01:39.566 --> 00:01:40.433
What is this?

41
00:01:41.733 --> 00:01:42.666
Eagle
