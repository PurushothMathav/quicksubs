00:00:00.666 --> 00:00:02.000
How do you know that?

2
00:00:02.266 --> 00:00:04.366
Because I bought a pack myself

3
00:00:04.533 --> 00:00:06.700
The other day I saw the key bag you dropped on the ground

4
00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:08.200
So I recognize it.

5
00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.500
Why did you buy this?

6
00:00:10.966 --> 00:00:12.400
Of course it's for you.

7
00:00:14.533 --> 00:00:15.933
Give it and don't give it to me

8
00:00:15.933 --> 00:00:17.366
You keep making it up to me.

9
00:00:17.366 --> 00:00:19.000
Trying to drug me again

10
00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.333
What do you mean by that?

11
00:00:21.333 --> 00:00:23.200
When did I not give it?

12
00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:24.566
It was clearly given that day

13
00:00:24.566 --> 00:00:26.000
You can't do it yourself

14
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.966
I kindly help you heal

15
00:00:27.966 --> 00:00:29.366
And then you blame me?

16
00:00:29.733 --> 00:00:31.066
What? I can't

17
00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.133
You obviously wanted to take the opportunity to drown me that day

18
00:00:34.133 --> 00:00:36.766
Everything is ready, everything is um

19
00:00:37.566 --> 00:00:38.666
What's that?

20
00:00:39.566 --> 00:00:40.533
Wolf spray

21
00:00:40.533 --> 00:00:41.500
B fan spray

22
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.300
And that motor rod.

23
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.300
That's your gift to me.

24
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.100
I've saved it all.

25
00:00:47.266 --> 00:00:48.066
that

26
00:00:48.533 --> 00:00:50.066
What about the scissors hanging by the bed?

27
00:00:50.366 --> 00:00:51.966
Those scissors are to ward off evil spirits

28
00:00:51.966 --> 00:00:54.000
What about photons?

29
00:00:54.533 --> 00:00:56.966
That means I misunderstood you.

30
00:00:56.966 --> 00:00:58.733
Of course you misunderstood me.

31
00:00:58.733 --> 00:01:00.166
Even if I have to cut you

32
00:01:00.166 --> 00:01:02.700
You need to prepare those big scissors

33
00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.666
How is this small enough?
