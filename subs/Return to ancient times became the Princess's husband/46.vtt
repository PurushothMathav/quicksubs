00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:07.366
Emperor, Emperor Pastor's confidence

2
00:00:07.366 --> 00:00:09.566
Fear of death

3
00:00:09.566 --> 00:00:11.400
What sister li

4
00:00:11.766 --> 00:00:12.900
beacon

5
00:00:13.933 --> 00:00:16.066
The emperor must have eaten the food made by the whiskers

6
00:00:16.066 --> 00:00:17.166
The strength of infection

7
00:00:17.166 --> 00:00:18.500
Don't talk nonsense

8
00:00:18.566 --> 00:00:21.066
We all ate, how are we okay?

9
00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.233
That's the problem of feeding the chickens

10
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.133
Liang Wang also bought MSG for the emperor to eat

11
00:00:28.133 --> 00:00:31.866
You mean that His Royal Highness the King of Liang wants to murder the Emperor?

12
00:00:31.866 --> 00:00:34.766
I don't have His Royal Highness

13
00:00:34.866 --> 00:00:36.100
That's not what I meant.

14
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:36.933
Wang Jun

15
00:00:36.933 --> 00:00:40.000
The emperor got sick after eating the food you cooked

16
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.566
It must be because of you

17
00:00:43.166 --> 00:00:45.366
It's you who's to blame

18
00:00:45.366 --> 00:00:48.633
What does this have to do with us?

19
00:00:49.366 --> 00:00:51.400
Taiyi 6 I ask you

20
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.700
What the emperor has determined is the righteousness of evil

21
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.766
Absolutely can't be wrong

22
00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:00.000
Malignant strength is simply incurable

23
00:01:00.066 --> 00:01:01.266
Then I'll ask you again.

24
00:01:02.066 --> 00:01:04.466
The onset of malignant self-interest is a few days

25
00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:06.900
More than four or five days

26
00:01:07.066 --> 00:01:09.300
At least a day or two

27
00:01:09.733 --> 00:01:13.166
I heard that the emperor has been ill for a day or two

28
00:01:13.366 --> 00:01:15.900
What does it have to do with my food?

29
00:01:16.933 --> 00:01:17.900
Again

30
00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.066
You have been serving the emperor these days

31
00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.466
Isn't your male driver so busy?
