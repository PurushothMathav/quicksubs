00:00:00.766 --> 00:00:02.300
You drank this bowl of soup

2
00:00:02.366 --> 00:00:05.033
Or I'm going to die here

3
00:00:05.066 --> 00:00:06.533
Isn't it just a bowl of soup?

4
00:00:06.533 --> 00:00:07.633
I'll just drink it.

5
00:00:08.266 --> 00:00:09.066
Princess

6
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:11.200
The princess is not good

7
00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:12.566
Someone attacked the Duke's Mansion

8
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.666
Our people are all dead

9
00:00:14.666 --> 00:00:17.300
What? Who dares to trespass into our Duke's Mansion?

10
00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:18.466
I don't know now.

11
00:00:18.466 --> 00:00:19.366
The other party is the master

12
00:00:19.366 --> 00:00:20.300
We can't stop it

13
00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:21.166
Princess, run away

14
00:00:21.166 --> 00:00:23.566
Otherwise it's too late it's too late

15
00:00:23.566 --> 00:00:25.600
Just let it go

16
00:00:27.133 --> 00:00:28.466
Hahahaha

17
00:00:28.466 --> 00:00:30.366
The second brother turned out to be you

18
00:00:30.366 --> 00:00:32.166
Why did you sneak into my lair?

19
00:00:32.333 --> 00:00:34.466
You didn't want to fight for the throne with me

20
00:00:35.133 --> 00:00:37.566
But you and Wang Xun have repeatedly spoiled my good deeds

21
00:00:37.566 --> 00:00:39.233
Disgrace me

22
00:00:39.933 --> 00:00:42.166
You say you should kill

23
00:00:42.166 --> 00:00:43.500
The person you are looking for is Wang Xun

24
00:00:43.733 --> 00:00:45.366
Nothing to do with anyone else in the mansion

25
00:00:45.366 --> 00:00:48.600
Fart if it wasn't for the power of your duchy

26
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.466
How can Wang Xun rise so fast?

27
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.766
Became the governor of the weapons army?

28
00:00:52.766 --> 00:00:55.666
I guess you didn't just come here to kill people

29
00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:56.766
What else do you want?

30
00:00:56.766 --> 00:00:57.866
Go ahead, haha.

31
00:00:57.866 --> 00:00:59.233
You are really smart

32
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.300
No wonder Father loves you so much

33
00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:06.100
Yes, we're not just here to kill

34
00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.300
I did it for your inventions

35
00:01:09.466 --> 00:01:11.666
Especially the method of refining jokes
