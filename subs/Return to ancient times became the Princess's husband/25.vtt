00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:02.566
Take it off for me no

2
00:00:02.566 --> 00:00:04.100
This wine is too strong

3
00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:06.633
I have never had such good wine

4
00:00:06.733 --> 00:00:08.400
Can you flash the eel?

5
00:00:13.966 --> 00:00:14.766
OK

6
00:00:15.766 --> 00:00:18.800
This is the true first wine in the world

7
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.833
Come, come, give me another drink

8
00:00:21.166 --> 00:00:22.100
That's not possible.

9
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.366
There must be no wine in this world that is more drunk than the gods

10
00:00:24.366 --> 00:00:27.066
I don't believe in Father Emperor, you must be miserable

11
00:00:27.066 --> 00:00:29.033
Zhang Ning didn't want him to be physically punished

12
00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.266
Presumptuous, are you questioning me?

13
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:33.166
Children dare not

14
00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:35.366
The son applies to taste it for himself

15
00:00:35.366 --> 00:00:37.700
Ok I can let you taste it

16
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.500
But after you taste it

17
00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.066
If this wine exceeds your fairy power

18
00:00:42.066 --> 00:00:43.666
I will punish you

19
00:00:44.466 --> 00:00:46.233
Children have the most confidence in immortals

20
00:00:46.566 --> 00:00:49.400
I am willing to work with my father to help King Liang

21
00:00:57.366 --> 00:00:58.233
That's not possible.

22
00:00:59.166 --> 00:01:01.633
How can this wine be better than the gods?

23
00:01:01.666 --> 00:01:03.900
Impossible for King Song Liang to return to his home

24
00:01:04.333 --> 00:01:06.833
Reflection on not leaving the house for three days

25
00:01:10.066 --> 00:01:12.666
Wang Xue now has a great contribution to fine wine

26
00:01:13.866 --> 00:01:15.200
I want to reward you

27
00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.100
Tell me what you want, I will promise you.

28
00:01:19.466 --> 00:01:21.066
Any reward is fine

29
00:01:21.266 --> 00:01:24.366
It should be fine if you want to marry a princess, right?
