00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:01.666
reply to lie

2
00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:04.300
It's abdominals and lunges, no plucking, no raw material.

3
00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:06.633
Wang Xuncai can't even come out with a knife

4
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.866
The abdomen and lunges are both sent by you normally

5
00:00:11.733 --> 00:00:14.533
Are you interfering in the bushes?

6
00:00:14.533 --> 00:00:17.200
There is absolutely no misunderstanding between the father and the son

7
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:19.133
It is because the household is seriously in deficit

8
00:00:19.133 --> 00:00:20.766
Can't come up with money to announce

9
00:00:20.766 --> 00:00:22.600
Can't provide raw materials

10
00:00:24.733 --> 00:00:25.533
Wait a minute.

11
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:29.733
Is it really impossible to take out the silver for the goods?

12
00:00:29.733 --> 00:00:31.000
So poor

13
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:34.266
A lot of silver was spent on soldiers in the north

14
00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.833
Many officials did not contribute for three months

15
00:00:38.766 --> 00:00:42.266
Rich, if something goes wrong, please take care of it.

16
00:00:43.533 --> 00:00:46.900
Since the emperor has no forgiveness and no money

17
00:00:46.966 --> 00:00:51.233
It's hard for that minister to create this 100,000 sword, you

18
00:00:53.566 --> 00:00:56.100
The saber can be delivered to the front in time

19
00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.000
I am bigger than the summer

20
00:00:58.933 --> 00:01:01.400
This is the scourge of subjugation

21
00:01:02.466 --> 00:01:04.433
No, think about it.

22
00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.366
All of you think to me

23
00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:09.600
Can't think of a way

24
00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.066
None of you are leaving here

25
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.400
Doesn't the Emperor Wang Jun usually have a lot of ideas?

26
00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.100
I believe this matter should be handed over to Wang Jun

27
00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.200
You won't be disappointed

28
00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.600
Yes, it was his duty to build weapons

29
00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.000
It was his duty.

30
00:01:26.066 --> 00:01:27.033
No way.

31
00:01:27.566 --> 00:01:29.066
The imperial court can't solve it

32
00:01:29.066 --> 00:01:30.733
Wang Xun can't solve it alone

33
00:01:30.733 --> 00:01:32.033
I am also optimistic about Wang Xun

34
00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:34.466
Human potential is limitless

35
00:01:34.566 --> 00:01:36.133
As long as he is willing to work hard

36
00:01:36.133 --> 00:01:39.100
The king believes that he will succeed

37
00:01:40.066 --> 00:01:42.533
Since the emperor's treasury is in short supply

38
00:01:42.533 --> 00:01:46.200
Then our Duke's Mansion will raise the money for the construction

39
00:01:46.566 --> 00:01:47.766
This house is well built

40
00:01:47.766 --> 00:01:50.300
Give it to the court at the price of 30 taels

41
00:01:50.333 --> 00:01:52.466
The court only needs to pay the interest

42
00:01:52.466 --> 00:01:53.833
Only the emperor

43
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.400
Can you promise me two conditions?

44
00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:00.366
Tell me what conditions you want me to promise you.
