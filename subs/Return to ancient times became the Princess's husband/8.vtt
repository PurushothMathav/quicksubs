00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:03.966
The emperor has repeatedly given birth like me for no reason

2
00:00:04.133 --> 00:00:05.366
Please forgive me

3
00:00:05.366 --> 00:00:07.000
I'm going to kill him with my own hands

4
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.900
Boy, I'll give you a chance.

5
00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:11.100
If you can't be clean

6
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:13.300
I will destroy your nine clans

7
00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:14.300
Mr. Dong

8
00:00:14.733 --> 00:00:18.933
You didn't realize that this Magpie Bridge Immortal is just the remains of a half-sparrow

9
00:00:18.933 --> 00:00:20.033
That's not possible.

10
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.966
Magpie Bridge Immortal was done by this young master himself

11
00:00:22.966 --> 00:00:25.266
How could it be a half-sparrow silkworm slice?

12
00:00:25.333 --> 00:00:26.466
What about Magpie Bridge Immortal?

13
00:00:26.466 --> 00:00:28.333
It's not just a poem title.

14
00:00:28.333 --> 00:00:30.166
It's a word tag.

15
00:00:30.333 --> 00:00:32.000
The poem contains 56 characters

16
00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:34.933
Did you just recite going up or down?

17
00:00:34.933 --> 00:00:36.933
What's next?

18
00:00:36.933 --> 00:00:39.600
Mr. Dong, this poem was not written by you

19
00:00:39.733 --> 00:00:41.000
Read it out now

20
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.933
Hurry up and carry it or you will be the Seventh Army

21
00:00:42.933 --> 00:00:45.066
Why do you say it will go on?

22
00:00:45.366 --> 00:00:46.866
There is the second half of the sentence

23
00:00:46.866 --> 00:00:48.700
Because I wrote this poem

24
00:00:48.866 --> 00:00:50.466
I said yes, of course there is.

25
00:00:50.466 --> 00:00:52.266
Then you say you did it

26
00:00:52.266 --> 00:00:55.133
Then you can read the whole article

27
00:00:55.133 --> 00:00:56.366
Then listen to me
