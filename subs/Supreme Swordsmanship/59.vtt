00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:03.400
Today you are your day

2
00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:06.366
live on

3
00:00:11.266 --> 00:00:12.366
Go to the beast

4
00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:13.900
But you fought

5
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:20.300
Yeah.

6
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.400
Cockroach, are you okay?

7
00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:26.600
The kid who practices qi

8
00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.100
Didn't he once boast that Haikou wanted to see me?

9
00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:30.566
Now the deity is here

10
00:00:30.566 --> 00:00:34.066
Instead, he shrunk his head as a turtle, hahahaha.

11
00:00:35.266 --> 00:00:36.500
Zhao Ping, you

12
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.266
He doesn't deserve to owe our suzerain at all

13
00:00:39.266 --> 00:00:40.500
You are courting death

14
00:00:40.966 --> 00:00:44.233
Your Thunder Cloud Sect is really impatient

15
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:45.500
i

16
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.066
Run out

17
00:00:53.666 --> 00:00:56.400
No wonder a Qi Hunter dared to be so rampant

18
00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.000
It turns out that there is a Xuanyinzong platform for you behind you

19
00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.933
Lei Yun Tianzun

20
00:00:59.933 --> 00:01:01.366
I suggest you step down now

21
00:01:01.366 --> 00:01:03.133
The matter is still open to negotiation.

22
00:01:03.133 --> 00:01:06.466
Lest the Thunder Cloud Sect get a doomed end

23
00:01:06.466 --> 00:01:07.700
Hahahahaha

24
00:01:07.933 --> 00:01:09.700
Unexpectedly, the dignified Xuanyin Sect

25
00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.633
It was actually reduced to falling into a well with me

26
00:01:11.666 --> 00:01:13.566
Tianzong can be matched as the Netherworld of Heaven

27
00:01:13.566 --> 00:01:15.266
Even if I, Xuan Yingzong, are lonely

28
00:01:15.266 --> 00:01:17.966
It's not your turn to trample on the Thunder Cloud Sect at will

29
00:01:17.966 --> 00:01:20.000
Hmph, it's someone else's dog

30
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:20.866
Talk about dignity

31
00:01:20.866 --> 00:01:21.800
Xuanyin Saint Venerable

32
00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.500
You are too naive

33
00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.166
Now if you step back

34
00:01:33.166 --> 00:01:35.100
The deity can die without saving it

35
00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.933
What a good dog!

36
00:01:36.933 --> 00:01:38.733
For a mere trainer

37
00:01:38.733 --> 00:01:41.266
Even the Tongque Mausoleum of the Protector Emperor soldiers has moved out

38
00:01:41.266 --> 00:01:42.733
If my ancestors hadn't left the customs

39
00:01:42.733 --> 00:01:44.866
I really don't want to go head-to-head with you

40
00:01:46.466 --> 00:01:47.366
Happy Hall

41
00:01:47.366 --> 00:01:49.166
The old man hasn't painted yet

42
00:01:49.166 --> 00:01:51.900
When is it your turn to yell here?

43
00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.366
It's the ancestor of Thunder Cloud

44
00:01:53.366 --> 00:01:54.166
Oh, my God.

45
00:01:54.166 --> 00:01:56.300
It's all over now
