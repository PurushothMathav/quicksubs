00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.266
Hey, if the sect master kills the holy general, it means war

2
00:00:05.533 --> 00:00:08.500
The Holy King's Temple will never give up

3
00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:10.133
Sovereign is young

4
00:00:10.133 --> 00:00:11.700
Really impulsive

5
00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:15.900
I'll discuss and decide to relocate as soon as possible

6
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.600
Hmm?

7
00:00:19.466 --> 00:00:20.633
Where?

8
00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.033
Temple of the Holy Kings

9
00:00:24.666 --> 00:00:27.833
Yo, why did you hear shit as soon as you came?

10
00:00:29.766 --> 00:00:31.866
Sovereign Sovereign

11
00:00:32.533 --> 00:00:35.766
Sect Master This King thought that this ten thousand years

12
00:00:35.766 --> 00:00:37.233
Tianzong recuperation

13
00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.500
Why should there be a few characters?

14
00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.266
I didn't expect you to be down to this ant

15
00:00:42.266 --> 00:00:44.500
The Lord is so funny

16
00:00:45.266 --> 00:00:47.166
The Holy King is here, let's run

17
00:00:47.466 --> 00:00:51.566
Today, even the Venerable One above the Nine Heavens must die

18
00:00:51.566 --> 00:00:54.233
I didn't expect the building behavior to be good

19
00:00:54.266 --> 00:00:56.700
Ordinary people do not kneel and worship when they see this king

20
00:00:56.933 --> 00:00:58.000
Just shit

21
00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.566
Do not do

22
00:00:58.566 --> 00:01:01.800
If you can die in My Royal Highness, you will die without regrets

23
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:09.833
Light Fist Ant

24
00:01:10.366 --> 00:01:11.666
Just you

25
00:01:12.133 --> 00:01:13.966
The holy general who burned the temple of my holy king

26
00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.766
I'm really curious

27
00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.500
How on Earth did you manage to do that?

28
00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.066
What means did you use?

29
00:01:21.166 --> 00:01:23.566
Presumptuous you are not a bully

30
00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.233
Is looking for death

31
00:01:34.566 --> 00:01:35.366
