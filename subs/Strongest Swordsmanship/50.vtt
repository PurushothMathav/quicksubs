00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:05.900
Why don't you hurry up?

2
00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:07.200
If we don't go, we can't go

3
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.433
See if you can lend me a few tricks

4
00:00:11.666 --> 00:00:13.900
You want me to see who can save you?

5
00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:16.466
It's a pity I can't kill the antelope with my own hands

6
00:00:16.466 --> 00:00:17.866
To hell with that.

7
00:00:19.266 --> 00:00:20.066
Ah!

8
00:00:20.566 --> 00:00:21.366
Ah!

9
00:00:23.733 --> 00:00:24.533
What are you still doing?

10
00:00:24.533 --> 00:00:25.500
Hurry up

11
00:00:27.933 --> 00:00:30.900
Originally, I disdained to kill you little thieves

12
00:00:31.466 --> 00:00:34.000
Today is the day you have to come to your door to die

13
00:00:34.066 --> 00:00:35.400
Go get a chicken hunter

14
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.266
Ants dare to compete with the old man

15
00:00:37.333 --> 00:00:39.400
And you're dead, right?

16
00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:49.400
How come?

17
00:00:51.066 --> 00:00:51.900
you

18
00:00:52.733 --> 00:00:55.166
How could you have such a thing

19
00:00:59.133 --> 00:01:00.233
Oh, I see.

20
00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.800
It must be the broken sword in the hall

21
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.700
Now I know I forgot
