00:00:02.766 --> 00:00:04.133
Why are you not in a hurry?

2
00:00:04.133 --> 00:00:05.700
It's burning my butt

3
00:00:05.966 --> 00:00:07.433
Why should I be in a hurry?

4
00:00:07.566 --> 00:00:10.300
This time, Tianzong is because of the protection of heaven and earth.

5
00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:11.333
Just barely escaped

6
00:00:11.333 --> 00:00:12.800
But it's just a split soul after all

7
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.200
If the Thunder Cloud Sect came out of the Qing Dynasty

8
00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:15.766
Don't we just have to wait to die?

9
00:00:15.933 --> 00:00:17.866
Don't worry, it'll be alright.

10
00:00:18.766 --> 00:00:19.600
Ah!

11
00:00:25.333 --> 00:00:27.233
What do you mean by taking me back to Xuanyingzong?

12
00:00:27.466 --> 00:00:30.566
Do you want my father to help Tianzong?

13
00:00:31.266 --> 00:00:32.566
I'll tell you the truth.

14
00:00:32.566 --> 00:00:33.900
The ancestor of our Xuanyi Sect

15
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:35.500
It was painted 7,000 years ago

16
00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.466
My father still hasn't broken through the bible

17
00:00:37.466 --> 00:00:39.300
Even if he is really willing to help you

18
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.400
You are no match for Thunder Cloud Sect at all

19
00:00:41.566 --> 00:00:42.400
and

20
00:00:42.466 --> 00:00:45.766
Thunder Cloud Sect is not the only terrifying Thunder Cloud Tianzun

21
00:00:45.766 --> 00:00:47.566
The ancestor in the thundercloud is still alive

22
00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:49.133
If he makes a move

23
00:00:49.133 --> 00:00:51.466
I'm afraid no one in this world can match

24
00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:53.433
Who said anything about asking your father to take action?

25
00:00:54.266 --> 00:00:56.000
Then why did you bring me back?

26
00:00:57.466 --> 00:00:58.300
Ah!

27
00:01:03.866 --> 00:01:05.766
What are you doing in Wujian Purgatory?

28
00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:07.533
Wu Jian

29
00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:09.400
Come on out.

30
00:01:13.866 --> 00:01:14.666
Ah!

31
00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:19.033
Hahaha, I'm finally free.

32
00:01:19.133 --> 00:01:19.766
Are you crazy?

33
00:01:19.766 --> 00:01:22.200
He is the devil who once harmed the nine heavens and ten lands

34
00:01:22.266 --> 00:01:23.400
How dare you let him go!

35
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.100
Don't worry, even if I lend him 10 guts

36
00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.633
He doesn't dare to do anything wrong
