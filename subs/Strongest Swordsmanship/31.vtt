00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.100
What are you doing?

2
00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:10.233
thought circle

3
00:00:11.066 --> 00:00:13.266
This is the so-called Under the Nine Heavens

4
00:00:13.266 --> 00:00:14.500
A god formation that no one can break

5
00:00:15.766 --> 00:00:16.400
Since it's a small matter

6
00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.833
A single drop of blood broke these four arrays

7
00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:20.633
It's just a dream

8
00:00:20.766 --> 00:00:22.333
Although this battle is impregnable

9
00:00:22.333 --> 00:00:23.366
It's a death row

10
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.100
But there are also some tricks hidden

11
00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:27.200
That is a drop of surprise for the deity

12
00:00:28.866 --> 00:00:31.266
Four arrays broken

13
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.833
This child actually broke 4 arrays

14
00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:41.966
How is that possible?

15
00:00:43.533 --> 00:00:45.466
The Holy One is now broken

16
00:00:45.466 --> 00:00:46.566
Immortal Pavilion opens

17
00:00:46.566 --> 00:00:48.000
Is Zhu Shang dead?

18
00:00:48.766 --> 00:00:51.933
No, your surprise can be resolved

19
00:00:51.933 --> 00:00:52.900
Four arrays

20
00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.433
But it is definitely not something that can be understood by the descendants of heaven and earth

21
00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.433
Then don't forget our previous agreement

22
00:00:58.533 --> 00:00:59.900
Holy Promise

23
00:00:59.933 --> 00:01:01.433
Of course I won't stop

24
00:01:01.666 --> 00:01:02.866
Fairy elixir

25
00:01:03.266 --> 00:01:04.866
Put any of this outside

26
00:01:04.866 --> 00:01:06.566
It's all a treasure

27
00:01:13.133 --> 00:01:16.433
Ye Chen, this kid really did the practice of the ninth revolution of heaven and earth

28
00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.200
Hidden in this broken box

29
00:01:21.366 --> 00:01:23.166
Brother Lin is really amazing

30
00:01:23.166 --> 00:01:24.833
Dusty Immortal Pavilion

31
00:01:25.066 --> 00:01:27.633
It was opened by a drop of your menstrual blood

32
00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:31.333
Little brother, what did this kid do?

33
00:01:31.333 --> 00:01:33.666
How to make Zunkui align so politely

34
00:01:34.166 --> 00:01:35.200
Just happened to be in a book

35
00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.966
I just saw the solution in ancient books

36
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.133
It's not a big deal.

37
00:01:38.133 --> 00:01:42.500
Little Brother Lin, whether it is talent or opportunity

38
00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.000
No one can match

39
00:01:44.566 --> 00:01:45.800
That being the case

40
00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:48.266
Scene 2 come out

41
00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:01.300
Sure enough, it was the first day of Xuanying Sect's teaching

42
00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:02.700
Not only talent

43
00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.633
And gave birth to such a pious and patriotic son

44
00:02:06.166 --> 00:02:08.666
I said I'm not interested in the Virgin

45
00:02:09.933 --> 00:02:12.466
However, this deity lacks an oath

46
00:02:13.066 --> 00:02:14.700
Saintess if she wills

47
00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.833
The deity can consider it.
