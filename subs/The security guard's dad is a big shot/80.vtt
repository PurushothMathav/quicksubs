1
00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:03.533
It seems that the Tibetan Snow Group

2
00:00:03.533 --> 00:00:05.400
It can't finish our eight families

3
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.300
The entrusted Tianbang task

4
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:08.900
Trillion compensation

5
00:00:09.066 --> 00:00:10.966
Even if Mother Qianxue sells herself

6
00:00:10.966 --> 00:00:12.333
Can't make up that number

7
00:00:12.333 --> 00:00:14.666
I think the leaders should pack up.

8
00:00:14.666 --> 00:00:17.200
Get ready to receive Canxue Group

9
00:00:17.266 --> 00:00:19.500
To receive Cangxue Group

10
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:20.566
Take your mother again

11
00:00:20.566 --> 00:00:22.100
Your mom finally bullshit

12
00:00:22.533 --> 00:00:24.500
Humph Qianxue

13
00:00:24.866 --> 00:00:26.900
You finally showed up.

14
00:00:27.966 --> 00:00:29.300
Reflect on the housekeepers

15
00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.466
Contact the head of the eight major families

16
00:00:31.466 --> 00:00:33.500
About the Tianbang mission

17
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.566
Cangxue Group wants to hold talks and consultations

18
00:00:36.666 --> 00:00:37.666
wood fresh snow

19
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.900
What else can you negotiate with us?

20
00:00:40.133 --> 00:00:41.200
According to regulations

21
00:00:41.266 --> 00:00:43.800
If you can't complete these orders, you will be compensated tenfold.

22
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.600
Is that right?

23
00:00:45.866 --> 00:00:47.066
lose money lose money lose money

24
00:00:47.066 --> 00:00:48.566
3 days to lose money

25
00:00:49.133 --> 00:00:50.700
I only need three days.

26
00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.366
With the connections and resources of our Cangxue Group

27
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.433
I will definitely give you a satisfactory answer.

28
00:00:56.666 --> 00:00:56.900
At that time

29
00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:59.300
If our Cangxue Group doesn't complete the task

30
00:00:59.366 --> 00:01:01.366
Then I will pay 10 times compensation.

31
00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.066
Offer with both hands

32
00:01:03.166 --> 00:01:06.166
The connections of Cangxue Group hahaha

33
00:01:06.166 --> 00:01:09.400
No one in Qingzhou dares to help you now

34
00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.466
The task of being able to enter the sky list

35
00:01:11.466 --> 00:01:13.066
Which one is not very sleepy?

36
00:01:13.066 --> 00:01:15.966
Can you do it with your current Cangxue Group?

37
00:01:16.133 --> 00:01:18.866
Our Cangxue Group has been based in Qinzhou for many years

38
00:01:18.933 --> 00:01:19.600
Who doesn't know

39
00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.066
Our strength and resources

40
00:01:21.066 --> 00:01:22.800
You can see that.

41
00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.766
I see you still don't understand the form

42
00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.033
Our eight families advance and retreat together

43
00:01:27.166 --> 00:01:28.833
I'm not afraid to tell you

44
00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:30.333
Who dares to help you today?

45
00:01:30.333 --> 00:01:33.300
Tangxue Group is the enemy of our eight major groups

46
00:01:33.366 --> 00:01:36.966
Then the entire Qingzhou will have no place for him

47
00:01:36.966 --> 00:01:39.000
You've already colluded

48
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.133
Hahahahaha

49
00:01:41.133 --> 00:01:41.966
Exactly.

00:01:46.533 --> 00:01:48.766
Our eight families are doomed

53
00:01:48.766 --> 00:01:50.266
It's a deal. It's a deal.

54
00:01:50.266 --> 00:01:51.066
Did I say help?

55
00:01:51.066 --> 00:01:53.266
Gathered on 32 lines today
