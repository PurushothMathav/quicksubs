00:00:02.733 --> 00:00:03.700
Miss Ji

2
00:00:04.366 --> 00:00:06.000
This is all Ning Tianyu's information

3
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.400
Hope it helps you remember the gentleman

4
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:09.966
But only instructions

5
00:00:10.533 --> 00:00:12.400
There are no pictures of his daughter as a child

6
00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.066
The real status is so high

7
00:00:15.333 --> 00:00:17.500
Why is there no photo of my daughter?

8
00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:19.766
It is said that more than ten years ago

9
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.733
A fire broke out in Ling Tian's house

10
00:00:21.733 --> 00:00:23.266
Almost all of his family died

11
00:00:23.266 --> 00:00:25.633
Everything was burned.

12
00:00:25.666 --> 00:00:28.100
What's so bad?

13
00:00:29.933 --> 00:00:32.233
Do you remember that fire?

14
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.533
I will find a way to get Lin Tianyu's DNA.

15
00:00:42.533 --> 00:00:44.300
I'll compare it with yours then.

16
00:00:45.466 --> 00:00:46.266
Thanks a lot.

17
00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:48.466
Do you take money to do things?

18
00:00:48.466 --> 00:00:50.400
But don't get your hopes up.

19
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.600
The success rate of finding relatives is not high

20
00:00:52.766 --> 00:00:54.866
Otherwise, it wouldn't be on the news every time

21
00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.633
You're pretty good at comforting people

22
00:00:59.333 --> 00:01:00.600
More than ten years.

23
00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.066
I didn't want to save him as a life either

24
00:01:03.066 --> 00:01:03.866
straw

25
00:01:06.366 --> 00:01:08.366
It's just that I really want to know

26
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.600
Dad, is he still alive?

27
00:01:12.133 --> 00:01:12.933
in the end

28
00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.500
Did you come back to me?

29
00:01:19.666 --> 00:01:21.700
I was alone.

30
00:01:22.333 --> 00:01:23.833
In the alley

31
00:01:24.733 --> 00:01:26.166
Stayed for three days

32
00:01:27.533 --> 00:01:29.366
Been waiting for him

33
00:01:30.566 --> 00:01:32.800
I've been waiting for him to come back to me

34
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:52.800
No, no.

35
00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:55.100
No.

36
00:02:18.166 --> 00:02:19.633
It's dad, sorry

37
00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.633
Dad goes back at night
