00:00:15.866 --> 00:00:16.666
Dialect

2
00:00:17.066 --> 00:00:18.833
Go and prepare some food for the lady

3
00:00:18.966 --> 00:00:20.500
He spent a few days in the hospital

4
00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.900
You don't need to lose weight.

5
00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.200
I don't want to eat it.

6
00:00:26.333 --> 00:00:28.233
Leave me alone in the room

7
00:00:28.666 --> 00:00:29.900
You want to go on a hunger strike?

8
00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:31.900
Starve yourself to death?

9
00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.300
You can also let me go

10
00:00:34.733 --> 00:00:35.900
At least

11
00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.233
We can all be at peace

12
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.166
You just want to leave?

13
00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.266
Look at you now

14
00:00:43.566 --> 00:00:45.033
Can you take care of him?

15
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.266
Don't you care if this kid dies?

16
00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:50.033
Of course I care

17
00:00:50.066 --> 00:00:51.500
But what could I do?

18
00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.833
Did I give birth to him?

19
00:00:53.933 --> 00:00:56.166
Become an instrument of revenge between the two of us

20
00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:58.900
Or let him be like me

21
00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.766
Tied to you for a lifetime

22
00:01:03.333 --> 00:01:04.600
From now on

23
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.366
You can go out anytime.

24
00:01:07.566 --> 00:01:09.166
But someone has to follow

25
00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:10.866
I turned too far

26
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.366
Fu Yuanchuan, are you treating me like a dog?

27
00:01:18.366 --> 00:01:20.700
You need to tie a rope to rest assured.

28
00:01:22.266 --> 00:01:24.233
You know I don't like to hear that

29
00:01:25.766 --> 00:01:26.566
good boy

30
00:01:27.166 --> 00:01:29.266
As long as you give birth to this child well

31
00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:31.566
I will set you free

32
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.866
Are you really willing to let me go?
