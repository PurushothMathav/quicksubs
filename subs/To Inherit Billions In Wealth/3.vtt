1
00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.800
Ning Ziyan, we are not married yet

2
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:17.766
Can you live outside without getting married?

3
00:00:17.766 --> 00:00:19.400
Aren't you afraid I'll tell dad?

4
00:00:20.733 --> 00:00:24.200
I can cancel the engagement at any time if I'm not married

5
00:00:26.533 --> 00:00:28.366
This is a two-woman marriage.

6
00:00:28.466 --> 00:00:30.500
How can you say that you are rejecting the marriage?

7
00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:33.200
You are an adopted daughter

8
00:00:33.933 --> 00:00:36.566
If it weren't for the real money being lost in the early years

9
00:00:36.566 --> 00:00:37.833
How can it be your turn?

10
00:00:41.333 --> 00:00:44.000
I came all the way to see you

11
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.466
How can you say such hurtful things?

12
00:00:46.666 --> 00:00:47.900
I am human too

13
00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:49.600
There will also be emotions

14
00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.233
Then I suggest you be less emotional in the future

15
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.466
Because I don't like it.

16
00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:00.400
Okay, I promise to go obediently in the future

17
00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:02.066
I'll drive you to work

18
00:01:16.566 --> 00:01:17.800
10 years ago

19
00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.966
Fu Yuanchuan brought me home from the orphanage

20
00:01:21.566 --> 00:01:24.000
At that moment, I thought I had met the light

21
00:01:24.966 --> 00:01:29.066
Who knows it's a caged bird in captivity

22
00:01:42.966 --> 00:01:45.300
Miss Ji should be called the richest official and offered a reward of 100 million

23
00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:46.800
The world is looking for a daughter
