00:00:07.966 --> 00:00:08.766
Dad?

2
00:00:09.766 --> 00:00:10.666
Mom

3
00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:13.166
You were

4
00:00:15.466 --> 00:00:16.833
I'm having a hard time playing

5
00:00:18.666 --> 00:00:19.500
Vice President

6
00:00:21.066 --> 00:00:21.866
Dialect

7
00:00:23.666 --> 00:00:24.566
You say

8
00:00:25.366 --> 00:00:27.800
Am I feeling like a joke right now?

9
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.033
From Now On

10
00:00:32.666 --> 00:00:34.433
How should I face the Ning family?

11
00:00:34.866 --> 00:00:36.200
How to face the rush

12
00:00:38.066 --> 00:00:38.966
Vice President

13
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.000
There is still room for recovery

14
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.700
As long as you can save it

15
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:47.600
Kingman has disappeared

16
00:00:47.866 --> 00:00:50.600
Send more people to turn Jiangcheng over

17
00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:52.100
Find it for me too

18
00:00:53.133 --> 00:00:53.933
OK

19
00:00:55.166 --> 00:00:55.900
Vice President

20
00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:58.966
This is the divorce agreement sent by Miss Ji

21
00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.700
Oh, he said something.

22
00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.366
Say what to say

23
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.200
His real name is

24
00:01:08.866 --> 00:01:10.066
Nie Mengmeng

25
00:01:10.466 --> 00:01:11.266
So

26
00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:14.900
In fact, his marriage certificate with you can only be considered fake

27
00:01:16.066 --> 00:01:17.666
You were never married to him?

28
00:01:18.066 --> 00:01:20.266
He just wants to deny us everything

29
00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.066
And he had a good reason for that.

30
00:01:24.566 --> 00:01:25.900
You to him

31
00:01:26.766 --> 00:01:29.366
It's really not easy to roll

32
00:01:37.066 --> 00:01:37.866
Ah!

33
00:01:39.533 --> 00:01:40.333
silently

34
00:01:42.866 --> 00:01:43.666
Ah silence

35
00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:45.500
Is that really you?

36
00:01:45.666 --> 00:01:47.200
Let dad see you

37
00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.633
As long as you're okay, be quiet.

38
00:01:58.066 --> 00:02:00.800
My wife calls me in my dreams every day

39
00:02:01.766 --> 00:02:03.200
And I woke up.

40
00:02:04.066 --> 00:02:06.433
But I didn't see you.

41
00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:12.466
It's dad who's sorry for you

42
00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:16.766
So many years

43
00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.400
You must have suffered a lot.

44
00:02:21.133 --> 00:02:22.466
It's all over

45
00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.566
I want to mention these things again

46
00:02:26.133 --> 00:02:26.933
Ah!

47
00:02:27.666 --> 00:02:28.900
Forget it.

48
00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.000
Dad listen to you

49
00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.300
Dad can't even do it now

50
00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.866
Would you like to come back and help Dad?

51
00:02:41.166 --> 00:02:43.033
I have transferred all my property

52
00:02:43.366 --> 00:02:44.666
All transferred to you

53
00:02:48.133 --> 00:02:48.966
OK

54
00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.766
I also want to live a different way

55
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.033
Nice-eyed River, wait for me to see you again.

56
00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:07.933
I will put these names

57
00:03:07.933 --> 00:03:10.466
Take back what's lost
