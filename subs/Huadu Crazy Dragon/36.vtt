00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:05.300
You do a lot of stuff.

2
00:00:05.966 --> 00:00:07.600
Are you thinking too much?

3
00:00:07.766 --> 00:00:09.200
Get out of here

4
00:00:09.566 --> 00:00:10.800
To tell you the truth

5
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.133
No matter how good you are

6
00:00:12.133 --> 00:00:13.900
I can't be with you

7
00:00:16.733 --> 00:00:19.766
Miss Yan, I can't leave yet

8
00:00:19.966 --> 00:00:21.866
Uncle Yan's illness is difficult to treat

9
00:00:22.066 --> 00:00:24.533
I'm here to help him treat today.

10
00:00:24.533 --> 00:00:25.933
Did you think this was coming?

11
00:00:25.933 --> 00:00:27.200
But you can really go

12
00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.466
You don't have a chance.

13
00:00:28.466 --> 00:00:30.366
What's your business?

14
00:00:30.733 --> 00:00:32.900
You were lucky the first few times.

15
00:00:32.966 --> 00:00:34.866
Only I can cure Uncle Yan's illness

16
00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.666
Xiaoyan just conditioned my body for me

17
00:00:39.666 --> 00:00:40.900
You're okay now.

18
00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:41.900
How is that possible?

19
00:00:41.966 --> 00:00:43.266
What kind of medical skills does he have?

20
00:00:43.266 --> 00:00:44.666
Why wouldn't I?

21
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.266
It's not just for you, is it?

22
00:00:46.266 --> 00:00:48.066
Stop showing off, how are you?

23
00:00:50.166 --> 00:00:52.000
Xiaoye, so be it

24
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.066
I'll give you 500,000 as compensation

25
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.033
How about this engagement is over?

26
00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:59.900
500,000 you?

27
00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:03.266
This is already very face-saving for you. Just accept it when you see it.

28
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.666
Why are you targeting me again?

29
00:01:05.666 --> 00:01:07.033
Do I have a grudge against you?

30
00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:08.900
Bad things happen to me over and over again

31
00:01:09.266 --> 00:01:11.966
I see you are unhappy, so I will target you.

32
00:01:11.966 --> 00:01:13.533
I'm so pissed off that you hit me

33
00:01:13.533 --> 00:01:16.566
Come, come, come, come, come, good, good.

34
00:01:18.333 --> 00:01:19.300
Miss Yan

35
00:01:19.466 --> 00:01:22.700
I know you don't want to marry this Su

36
00:01:22.933 --> 00:01:25.766
I don't want to be the process of the marriage of Su Yan's two families

37
00:01:26.866 --> 00:01:27.966
Don't worry.

38
00:01:28.266 --> 00:01:30.033
I will
