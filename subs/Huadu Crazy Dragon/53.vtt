1
00:00:00.733 --> 00:00:01.500
otherwise

2
00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:04.100
How could a stubborn child of his know medicine?

3
00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:05.700
God loves humility

4
00:00:05.766 --> 00:00:07.833
Then suddenly reject people thousands of miles away

5
00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:10.566
That is to say, all this is unknown to Suze

6
00:00:10.566 --> 00:00:11.366
Right.

7
00:00:11.933 --> 00:00:14.233
After he framed me and ruined me like this

8
00:00:14.366 --> 00:00:15.633
You can have humility

9
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.666
I said how did you suddenly fall in love with me

10
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.400
Fell in love with me

11
00:00:21.666 --> 00:00:23.566
So you are jealous for the sake of competing

12
00:00:24.266 --> 00:00:27.300
You've been treating me like a fool and playing with snow

13
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.633
I really don't want to explain right now

14
00:00:29.966 --> 00:00:33.033
But all I can say is that I'm not afraid to lean back

15
00:00:33.533 --> 00:00:36.133
Money has said so, of course you have nothing to say

16
00:00:36.133 --> 00:00:38.066
I don't need to explain to you

17
00:00:38.333 --> 00:00:40.933
I just want to solve the land problem now

18
00:00:40.933 --> 00:00:42.466
Of course you can solve it.

19
00:00:42.766 --> 00:00:45.266
Isn't the problem here created by you?

20
00:00:45.266 --> 00:00:47.966
If Qianqian's conscience hadn't discovered and exposed you

21
00:00:48.133 --> 00:00:49.800
I'm about to be framed to death by you

22
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.300
So think about that.

23
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.000
I am a poor boy

24
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.200
Are you so capable of making all this?

25
00:01:01.133 --> 00:01:03.366
Brother Ye, end it all

26
00:01:03.366 --> 00:01:04.066
I'll go home with you.

27
00:01:04.066 --> 00:01:05.600
Can you stop talking nonsense?

28
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.066
Where am I going home with you?

29
00:01:07.066 --> 00:01:08.200
I'll say it again.

30
00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.766
I can never

31
00:01:09.966 --> 00:01:12.700
To be jealous of a woman and do these things

32
00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:13.800
People who understand me

33
00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:15.400
Of course I don't need an explanation

34
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.766
How can I trust you?

35
00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.266
Super simp

36
00:01:19.266 --> 00:01:20.566
Suddenly move on

37
00:01:20.566 --> 00:01:22.066
Only for me

38
00:01:22.066 --> 00:01:23.566
I foolishly believe

39
00:01:23.566 --> 00:01:25.233
Deceive my feelings for you
