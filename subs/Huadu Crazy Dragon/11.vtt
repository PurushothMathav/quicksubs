00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:02.566
It's a billion dollars.

2
00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:05.000
But if you lose

3
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.533
If I lose

4
00:00:06.533 --> 00:00:08.166
I knelt and kowtowed

5
00:00:08.166 --> 00:00:09.766
Also learn to bark three times

6
00:00:09.766 --> 00:00:11.500
Does Doctor Zhang gamble?

7
00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:13.566
Dog money is not good

8
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.000
Then please hum

9
00:00:23.133 --> 00:00:24.300
Are you sure?

10
00:00:24.666 --> 00:00:27.033
Don't worry, no one knows but me

11
00:00:27.166 --> 00:00:29.333
As long as Yechen saves people and gains trust

12
00:00:29.333 --> 00:00:31.266
It can conquer its alliance and slowly disintegrate

13
00:00:31.266 --> 00:00:33.466
All will be mine

14
00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.433
Hill, your medical skills are indeed brilliant

15
00:00:36.666 --> 00:00:40.100
But love letters are more than just blood

16
00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.300
He suffered very serious internal injuries in his early years

17
00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.866
After you detoxify with reoxygenation nine needles

18
00:00:44.933 --> 00:00:46.766
Be sure to use Taiyi God Needle again

19
00:00:46.766 --> 00:00:49.766
Only in this way can the poisonous blood in his body be completely eliminated

20
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.966
Otherwise he shouldn't live more than three minutes

21
00:00:52.966 --> 00:00:55.000
When did Brother Su become a doctor?

22
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.600
And far from what I see

23
00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:03.000
Dad?

24
00:01:04.066 --> 00:01:05.900
What? How is that possible?

25
00:01:06.966 --> 00:01:09.633
I can only do it by getting inheritance, so I don't need to feel my pulse.

26
00:01:09.666 --> 00:01:10.766
By ingratitude alone

27
00:01:10.766 --> 00:01:12.666
You can accurately determine the patient's condition

28
00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.233
This Zhang Xi'er's medical skills

29
00:01:14.266 --> 00:01:15.666
I shouldn't be able to see Qin Zhaoguo

30
00:01:15.666 --> 00:01:17.900
It's already inside the internal organs, Dad

31
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.200
How are you feeling?

32
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.866
I've never felt better.

33
00:01:21.866 --> 00:01:22.900
There you go.

34
00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:23.766
That's great.

35
00:01:23.766 --> 00:01:26.400
Thank you to Doctor Zhang.

36
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.100
Your grandfather saved my life many times

37
00:01:29.133 --> 00:01:30.400
You save me too

38
00:01:30.733 --> 00:01:32.700
Thank you so much

39
00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:34.800
Uncle Qin, don't thank me

40
00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.033
If it weren't for Brother Su reminding me

41
00:01:37.166 --> 00:01:38.766
Xin'er is in trouble now

42
00:01:38.766 --> 00:01:40.200
He reminded you

43
00:01:40.466 --> 00:01:42.700
Well, Brother Su is really hidden

44
00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.833
Hahaha, don't make fun of me.

45
00:01:44.866 --> 00:01:46.566
Let's watch the show

46
00:01:46.566 --> 00:01:49.700
Isn't there someone over there waiting to kneel?

47
00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.233
What about kowtowing and apologizing?
