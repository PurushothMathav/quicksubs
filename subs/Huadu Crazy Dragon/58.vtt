1
00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.666
How are you getting along with Yi Ze recently?

2
00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:06.066
It's alright. You're about to get married.

3
00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:08.533
Yanjia Business has reached a critical period again

4
00:00:08.533 --> 00:00:11.000
Don't make any trouble, right?

5
00:00:11.166 --> 00:00:12.700
Kyushu Business Alliance

6
00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:14.833
Got a big offshore power project

7
00:00:15.066 --> 00:00:16.800
I want you to find Yize

8
00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:18.433
Let's talk this through.

9
00:00:18.566 --> 00:00:21.700
Then our speech is stable

10
00:00:22.733 --> 00:00:23.533
Dad?

11
00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:26.600
Maybe yesterday.

12
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:28.400
But

13
00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:30.233
Not today.

14
00:00:30.366 --> 00:00:31.633
Why is that?

15
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.966
Because Su Yize is just using Cher to pick up girls

16
00:00:35.966 --> 00:00:38.366
I ripped off her mask yesterday

17
00:00:38.366 --> 00:00:40.300
I guess it won't come today.

18
00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.000
What are you doing here, boy?

19
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.800
Of course I'm here to help Uncle Yan

20
00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.600
Get the cooperation of Kyushu Business Alliance

21
00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.433
A project as big as your offshore power station

22
00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.566
That's a trillion-dollar investment.

23
00:00:52.566 --> 00:00:54.166
Other groups throughout major cities

24
00:00:54.166 --> 00:00:55.566
Including large foreign companies

25
00:00:55.566 --> 00:00:58.100
They all want to compete and cooperate with Kyushu Business Alliance

26
00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:59.833
And why do you

27
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:02.000
Please get out now

28
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.766
Stay away from my home

29
00:01:03.766 --> 00:01:06.666
Cher, is there some misunderstanding?

30
00:01:06.666 --> 00:01:08.633
Even if I don't marry Su Yuze

31
00:01:08.733 --> 00:01:10.966
I can't be with you either
