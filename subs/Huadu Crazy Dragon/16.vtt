00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.800
This is another one next to that lineage preparation.

2
00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:04.566
I don't see anything special yet.

3
00:00:04.566 --> 00:00:06.066
It should be an ordinary preparation

4
00:00:06.066 --> 00:00:07.100
What is he doing here?

5
00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:08.900
Look at him again, he seems to be full of confidence

6
00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:10.266
Did it really fill the prescription?

7
00:00:10.266 --> 00:00:11.466
How could it be?

8
00:00:11.466 --> 00:00:13.100
I will definitely believe him when he says he is simp

9
00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:15.566
How is it possible to complete this diluted and rare tonic prescription?

10
00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:17.600
Why not gamble

11
00:00:17.666 --> 00:00:19.466
Okay, forget it. Wait

12
00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:22.800
You are a super rich second generation

13
00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.066
Why do you want my poor boy's broken jade pendant?

14
00:00:25.133 --> 00:00:26.700
Otherwise, you

15
00:00:27.066 --> 00:00:29.066
Is there anything else valuable?

16
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.600
Ok I bet you

17
00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.966
But if you can't make up for it

18
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.866
Then kneel down and apologize to me

19
00:00:40.733 --> 00:00:42.333
And invest tens of billions in me

20
00:00:42.333 --> 00:00:43.166
OK

21
00:00:44.166 --> 00:00:45.366
Brother Yi will never have no right

22
00:00:45.366 --> 00:00:48.066
If you want to show off now, you can only copy your face

23
00:00:48.066 --> 00:00:49.733
The tens of billions of investment that Brother Chen wants

24
00:00:49.733 --> 00:00:50.900
It must be for me.

25
00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:52.200
That's great.

26
00:00:52.466 --> 00:00:55.500
Brother Chen, Brother Yi, stop making trouble.

27
00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.300
Qianqian, this is a man's business

28
00:01:06.966 --> 00:01:08.866
Can't you fill the prescription?

29
00:01:08.933 --> 00:01:11.866
Come on, what's the matter?

30
00:01:13.166 --> 00:01:14.366
No way.

31
00:01:15.333 --> 00:01:16.966
If not

32
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.033
Then kneel down and apologize to me

33
00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.000
What's your dog's name?

34
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.466
You can't fill the prescription and curse people

35
00:01:25.466 --> 00:01:27.233
What's wrong with me scolding you?

36
00:01:27.333 --> 00:01:30.466
Who else says I can't get a full-bone prescription?

37
00:01:30.466 --> 00:01:33.366
Xin'er, just take it out and let him know.
