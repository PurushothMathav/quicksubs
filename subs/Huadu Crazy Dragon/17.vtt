00:00:01.066 --> 00:00:02.966
Open your dog eyes and see clearly

2
00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:06.666
This is the ancient prescription written by Brother Su himself

3
00:00:06.966 --> 00:00:08.333
Confirmed by my grandfather

4
00:00:08.333 --> 00:00:11.300
This is the complete medicinal material of the ancient prescription of Golden Sore Medicine

5
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.033
Are you dumb? Hahaha.

6
00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:17.933
You're not going to cheat again, are you?

7
00:00:17.933 --> 00:00:20.700
A big man is not ashamed

8
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:22.300
I heard from Xi'er

9
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.266
You are also a healer

10
00:00:24.266 --> 00:00:26.766
But proud and complacent

11
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.800
It's hopeless

12
00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.266
It's just a broken jade pendant.

13
00:00:34.933 --> 00:00:38.500
Since you want it so much, Master Su

14
00:00:39.733 --> 00:00:41.366
Alms to you

15
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.066
Hey, why can't you afford to lose?

16
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.466
Miss Zhang Shenyi

17
00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.766
Brother Yi, Brother Chen is still young, don't be surprised, okay?

18
00:00:58.566 --> 00:01:00.166
Hey, brother Su

19
00:01:00.166 --> 00:01:02.266
What kind of baby is this fish match?

20
00:01:02.266 --> 00:01:03.866
You have seen so many treasures

21
00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:05.466
Why do you want this thing from him?

22
00:01:05.466 --> 00:01:08.300
This is really a good thing.

23
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:09.766
This one.

24
00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:11.633
I don't see it.

25
00:01:11.766 --> 00:01:13.200
Then you will know

26
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.066
It is the inheritance in this jade pendant.

27
00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:16.666
Let Yechen become a god in one fell swoop

28
00:01:16.666 --> 00:01:17.933
Later, stand up and fill it up.

29
00:01:17.933 --> 00:01:20.666
But I haven't had the time to receive the inheritance yet

30
00:01:20.666 --> 00:01:22.300
Need Yechen's blood to open

31
00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:23.700
Need to think of something
