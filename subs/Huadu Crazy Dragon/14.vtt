00:00:01.266 --> 00:00:02.900
Brother Chen, let's go

2
00:00:11.166 --> 00:00:13.666
Brother Su, when did you learn medical skills?

3
00:00:14.066 --> 00:00:15.400
Ah, right.

4
00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.800
Everyone has the impression that you are not doing your job properly

5
00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.200
He actually knows medical skills. He is usually low-key

6
00:00:21.333 --> 00:00:25.100
In fact, he is a rare talent.

7
00:00:25.133 --> 00:00:26.500
I read a few medical books

8
00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:27.400
Good luck.

9
00:00:27.933 --> 00:00:28.700
What a pity!

10
00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:31.300
This Ye Chen will go to Baicaotang to buy medicine in a blink of an eye

11
00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:32.100
Grandpa Hill

12
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:34.166
Confused broken bone prescription filled

13
00:00:34.166 --> 00:00:35.800
Received the high praise of Grandpa Hill

14
00:00:35.866 --> 00:00:37.533
To match Hill and Ye Chen

15
00:00:37.533 --> 00:00:39.633
Still can't escape the order of the harem

16
00:00:39.666 --> 00:00:41.633
Su Shao, what are you thinking about?

17
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.566
Ah, nothing, nor is Qin Mengyao

18
00:00:45.566 --> 00:00:48.100
Southern Xiangmu is the big pit dug by Ye Chen and Qin Tianlong

19
00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.000
Just to make Qin Mengyao lose a lot

20
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.200
Shake your position in the Qin family

21
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:52.900
Then Qin Tianlong took the decree

22
00:00:53.166 --> 00:00:54.366
Brother Su, come with me

23
00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:57.033
Oh, come with me, oh no

24
00:00:58.266 --> 00:01:00.166
Let's go, brother Yi

25
00:01:00.333 --> 00:01:02.133
In fact, he knew he was wrong

26
00:01:02.133 --> 00:01:03.900
He's just a little embarrassed.

27
00:01:03.933 --> 00:01:05.866
It's not easy for you to chase him for so many years

28
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.433
Don't worry, I'll hook you up.

29
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:09.666
It's a movie ticket.

30
00:01:09.666 --> 00:01:11.466
He will watch a movie with you tonight

31
00:01:11.466 --> 00:01:13.066
This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity

32
00:01:13.066 --> 00:01:13.966
Oh, you must come!

33
00:01:13.966 --> 00:01:15.833
Oops, go, go, go

34
00:01:18.333 --> 00:01:20.066
Cher just had a little situation

35
00:01:20.066 --> 00:01:20.866
I have to go out

36
00:01:20.866 --> 00:01:22.466
Can you wait for me here, brother pig?

37
00:01:22.533 --> 00:01:24.766
I booked a queen room at Jinling Hotel

38
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.033
Hope you like it.

39
00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.066
No, I didn't know that.
