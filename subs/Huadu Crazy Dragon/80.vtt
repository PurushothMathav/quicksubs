1
00:00:00.533 --> 00:00:02.200
It's not really the heart of the ocean.

2
00:00:02.266 --> 00:00:03.366
That is to say

3
00:00:04.133 --> 00:00:07.066
This pair of a brand subsidiary

4
00:00:07.066 --> 00:00:08.366
So I say it's true

5
00:00:08.366 --> 00:00:10.300
But not the true heart of the ocean

6
00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:13.366
Ye Chen, how dare you give me a stone of doom?

7
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.700
Do you want to kill me no no no

8
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:17.500
When I bought it

9
00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.566
He clearly told me it was the heart of the ocean

10
00:00:19.566 --> 00:00:22.666
Oops, you still don't get it.

11
00:00:23.066 --> 00:00:25.933
What he sold you is indeed the heart of the ocean

12
00:00:25.933 --> 00:00:27.500
But it's hope.

13
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.666
It's not really the heart of the ocean.

14
00:00:29.966 --> 00:00:33.066
The weight of the genuine product is 242 carats.

15
00:00:33.466 --> 00:00:35.000
How could this be?

16
00:00:36.266 --> 00:00:37.266
So Yechen

17
00:00:37.766 --> 00:00:39.300
You lost.

18
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.100
My good uncle bought your heart of the ocean

19
00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.100
Heart of the Ocean to

20
00:00:51.933 --> 00:00:52.733
to

21
00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.900
Take the Heart of the Ocean to Uncle Xu for identification

22
00:01:07.366 --> 00:01:08.533
The weight is correct

23
00:01:08.533 --> 00:01:11.000
This is the true heart of the ocean
