00:00:01.066 --> 00:00:01.866
Su Shao

2
00:00:02.333 --> 00:00:04.366
It's really haunting

3
00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:06.866
How can I meet you anywhere, Ye Chan?

4
00:00:07.066 --> 00:00:09.700
It's an honor for Su Yizawa to meet me

5
00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:11.433
You should be grateful

6
00:00:12.933 --> 00:00:13.733
Boss Chen

7
00:00:14.366 --> 00:00:16.100
This is your new recruit, right?

8
00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:18.333
Why are you so discerning now?

9
00:00:18.333 --> 00:00:20.266
You want this trash too

10
00:00:20.266 --> 00:00:21.366
Who are you calling trash?

11
00:00:21.366 --> 00:00:24.433
You, your grandmother has the guts to say it again

12
00:00:25.666 --> 00:00:27.433
How did you talk to Su Shao?

13
00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.266
It's not your place to speak

14
00:00:32.133 --> 00:00:34.266
Su Shao, don't be angry

15
00:00:34.266 --> 00:00:36.200
I'll take it slow

16
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.966
Are you here today?

17
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.733
Don't worry, I won't help anyone.

18
00:00:43.733 --> 00:00:46.300
I came here simply to be a witness

19
00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:47.700
You can rest assured to compete

20
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.566
Hahaha, that's fine, please do it.

21
00:00:56.333 --> 00:00:58.366
Why are you so stupid?

22
00:01:04.266 --> 00:01:05.466
Today's humiliation

23
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.733
It will be returned several times in the future

24
00:01:07.733 --> 00:01:10.500
Since Mr. Qian Su is here

25
00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.166
Let's get straight to the point.

26
00:01:12.333 --> 00:01:13.900
One from each side

27
00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:17.100
Whoever wins that land goes to whoever

28
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.433
How good

29
00:01:24.966 --> 00:01:26.900
I do it myself

30
00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:28.866
Which of you will fight?
