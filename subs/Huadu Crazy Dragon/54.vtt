00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:02.733
Cher, why don't you want to believe me?

2
00:00:02.733 --> 00:00:04.200
I believe you are the ghost

3
00:00:04.733 --> 00:00:06.133
Deal with the poles as soon as possible

4
00:00:06.133 --> 00:00:07.966
Otherwise, our Mr. Qin will not finish with you.

5
00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.533
Cher, I admit that I was indeed simp before.

6
00:00:13.533 --> 00:00:14.600
But I'm not now.

7
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:15.966
I have changed

8
00:00:17.866 --> 00:00:20.933
Cher, no one believes you, so pitiful

9
00:00:20.933 --> 00:00:24.100
Do you like the surprise given to you by Master Su?

10
00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:26.300
You don't really think you just won, do you?

11
00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.066
Your character has collapsed

12
00:00:28.133 --> 00:00:32.233
In the future, Qin Mengyao and Yan Ruoxue are afraid that they will hate you to death

13
00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:36.100
In addition, you have solved the problem of the land.

14
00:00:36.166 --> 00:00:39.366
This time I'm going to step on your head

15
00:00:39.466 --> 00:00:43.100
In the future, Qin Mengyao and Yan Ruoxue

16
00:00:43.466 --> 00:00:45.866
The woman who will eventually become my Yechen

17
00:00:46.666 --> 00:00:48.666
Brother Yi, don't blame me.

18
00:00:48.733 --> 00:00:50.866
You are really targeting Brother Chen too much.

19
00:00:50.866 --> 00:00:52.266
It's just too much

20
00:00:52.266 --> 00:00:53.300
As long as you want

21
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:54.866
We can still make up

22
00:00:55.566 --> 00:00:56.700
What do you mean?

23
00:00:57.266 --> 00:00:59.500
I want 1 billion investments

24
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:02.000
I also want you to help me build a bridge with Mr. Qin

25
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.866
Everything you gave Yan Ruoxue

26
00:01:04.266 --> 00:01:05.266
I want it too.

27
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:10.366
Hahahahaha brother, what are you laughing at?

28
00:01:10.366 --> 00:01:13.300
I'm afraid that Young Master Su has lost his mind and lost his mind

29
00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:15.100
You two don't really think

30
00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.633
Just use this small measure

31
00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:19.300
You can beat me
