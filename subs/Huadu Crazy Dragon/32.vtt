00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:05.533
What's the matter, Mr. Su?

2
00:00:05.533 --> 00:00:06.900
I still want to stay with each other

3
00:00:07.166 --> 00:00:08.700
I just wanted to ask you

4
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.066
Can I punch you in the face today?

5
00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:13.600
Three years of Handong

6
00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:15.500
Can you stop talking so much?

7
00:00:16.133 --> 00:00:17.266
Want to go?

8
00:00:17.366 --> 00:00:18.200
OK

9
00:00:18.966 --> 00:00:19.966
Save you a little blood

10
00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.566
The layout of this place without your blood

11
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:26.100
It will take at least three months to recover

12
00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:29.266
You probably don't want to cause more trouble, do you?

13
00:00:40.866 --> 00:00:42.666
This is for you

14
00:00:42.866 --> 00:00:45.966
It's not necessarily good who laughs in the end

15
00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:51.266
Be arrogant

16
00:00:51.266 --> 00:00:53.166
Someone will cry then

17
00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.900
Leaves

18
00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:58.966
What do you want him to learn?

19
00:00:59.333 --> 00:01:01.333
Do you want him to learn?

20
00:01:01.333 --> 00:01:03.600
Can't the construction site be completed in these three months?

21
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:04.866
A little bit exaggerated

22
00:01:04.866 --> 00:01:07.566
But if not, it would be more troublesome

23
00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:11.166
Su Shang, could it be that he really wants to harm us?

24
00:01:11.166 --> 00:01:12.400
Of course, yeah.

25
00:01:13.066 --> 00:01:14.100
I can't spare him

26
00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.033
Mr. Jin, I advise you

27
00:01:16.066 --> 00:01:17.466
Don't act rashly

28
00:01:17.666 --> 00:01:20.900
Why don't you think he's a poor boy?

29
00:01:21.333 --> 00:01:22.766
Reach out

30
00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:25.466
There are also many elves who are proficient in martial arts

31
00:01:25.466 --> 00:01:28.766
But there shouldn't be more than three who can beat him
