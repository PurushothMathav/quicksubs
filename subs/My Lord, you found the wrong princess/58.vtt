00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:04.520
What are you doing here?

2
00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.220
Hey! Why are you walking okay?

3
00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:12.080
What is this? Lintang, you

4
00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:13.540
Is this king not dead yet?

5
00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:14.780
You will die sooner or later

6
00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:16.260
I'm afraid I'll cry when the time comes

7
00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:17.240
Schedule it

8
00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:18.400
Schedule it

9
00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:19.020
Schedule! Yu Ling Luo

10
00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.580
You! Don’t be angry

11
00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.260
You said you were so angry

12
00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:23.460
I really promise that I can’t line up.

13
00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.000
How can we become a new California then?

14
00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:27.820
you're right

15
00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:29.470
I regret it now

16
00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:30.500
I decide now

17
00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:31.930
Even if you cure me a lot,

18
00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:33.980
I am not prepared to be reasonable with you either.

19
00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:37.120
Why are you like this? What's wrong?

20
00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:38.470
I tell you

21
00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:40.110
This is a memory arranged by the emperor

22
00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:41.510
This is the biggest arrangement arranged by the emperor

23
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.000
And I feel now

24
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:43.820
Be with you forever

25
00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:44.800
Couples are also good

26
00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:48.740
Who wants to be your husband and wife for the rest of their lives? They are arrogant and incompetent.

27
00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:50.740
It’s the so-called woman’s life

28
00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:53.470
You said you were arrogant, I admit it

29
00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:54.810
You said I can’t do this?

30
00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:56.290
Then I'll show you now

31
00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:57.210
can i do it

32
00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:03.250
Tell you not to be a strong person

33
00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:04.470
No, no, no

34
00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.870
What is this for?

35
00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:09.710
What are these?

36
00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:10.890
This is called the Medicine Moon

37
00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:13.740
There are many things inside

38
00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:16.180
where did you go

39
00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:17.220
You shouldn't stay

40
00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.500
Is the fourth queen my king?

41
00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:20.950
That's when

42
00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:22.530
I have to eat you well
