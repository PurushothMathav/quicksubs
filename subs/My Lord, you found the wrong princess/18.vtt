00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.260
Think of me as the most promising doctor in a top tertiary hospital.

2
00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:06.520
Where did I come from wearing this?

3
00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:09.250
What the hell kind of store is this?

4
00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:15.800
Don't ask for it. My mother's country loves me.

5
00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:18.490
I married a husband.

6
00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:20.990
Definitely still a gift-keeper.

7
00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:23.150
Why are you so miserable?

8
00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:30.990
I've been drinking during the day, taking advantage of the local area.

9
00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:35.360
Maybe the princess had performed surgery on the prince overnight.

10
00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:37.340
This is because the prince has changed for the better.

11
00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:43.800
I was born a little better than I was.

12
00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.660
You are so awesome. You are not good at anything. This is.

13
00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:53.050
Who am I to take care of you if I look for you now?

14
00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:54.780
I didn't expect that

15
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.620
The kingâ€™s concubine is a Kugu

16
00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:01.670
Spend less time on the screen

17
00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:02.550
I also talk a lot

18
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:07.220
You smile a little

19
00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:08.740
Laugh a little without falling asleep

20
00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:11.420
I tell you

21
00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:13.050
That prince

22
00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:15.610
Just because he can't

23
00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:18.580
That's why he's cheating on you

24
00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:24.330
If you dare to say that I am not good enough, then come, Miss.

25
00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:25.890
you drank too much

26
00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:27.730
Give me a rest and you too

27
00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:30.030
I want to come and drink with me.

28
00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.960
Are you unhappy too?

29
00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.580
Don't let me make you angry
