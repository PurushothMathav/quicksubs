00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:09.210
Things at original price. What's up?

2
00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:11.250
This is my stuff, my price.

3
00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:15.730
Most people use their precious skills to determine the price.

4
00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:17.820
How do you use gold characters as a price?

5
00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:21.480
What's the matter? Wasn't the treasure hand also bought with gold characters?

6
00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.420
In this case, it is even faster.

7
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.880
This, perm, looks like it.

8
00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:36.040
Why do I feel like I have a perm? I see.

9
00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.490
You try because that day,

10
00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:40.850
The matter of taking off my penis,

11
00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:42.430
What about coming back?

12
00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:44.900
Just look at today

13
00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:46.340
Not bad. Let's check again.

14
00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:47.020
Open this

15
00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:50.000
What does it mean if you look at it more, it'll be fine. It's really fine. It's fine.
