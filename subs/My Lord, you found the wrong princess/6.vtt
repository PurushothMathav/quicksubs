00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:06.170
The prince's poison has penetrated deeply into Gu Sui,

2
00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:08.710
I am also helpless,

3
00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:10.690
Teacher, Mr. Bai,

4
00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:12.310
You are a master of national arts in our competition,

5
00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.329
From that moment on, I fell in love with Wang Ye. I have never seen such poison as Wang Ye.

6
00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:18.540
How to call it?

7
00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:20.780
You, a woman of various degrees, want to catch the money cleanly,

8
00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.280
I didn't do it, I don't have any money,

9
00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:25.920
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah,

10
00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.420
Ah, ah, ah, ah,

11
00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.710
Ah, ah, ah,

12
00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:33.740
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah,

13
00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:35.300
Ah, ah, ah, ah,

14
00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:36.180
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah,

15
00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.920
If you don’t watch it, you will give up.

16
00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.540
I think he's just a fan

17
00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:40.770
Never remembered

18
00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:42.670
A quick talk about the medical situation of private households

19
00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:45.170
I told you who he is

20
00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:46.470
I am Wang Yi’s princess

21
00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:47.770
Quickly let me get rid of this

22
00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:50.020
Otherwise he will really die soon

23
00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:51.420
Tell me what you can do first

24
00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:52.780
Let go of alone first

25
00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:54.640
Then ask for two more copies

26
00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:56.520
As for the time to start school?

27
00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.220
It depends on whether he can prove it or not.

28
00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:01.380
About six hours and three hours

29
00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:03.680
We have not even passed a single moment now.

30
00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:05.120
How can I have time to do the Big Five in three hours?

31
00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:06.940
What should you do to exonerate yourself?

32
00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.260
If I don’t want to worry about it, what can I do to him? I’ll tell you now.

33
00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:11.720
The new health industry killed my husband

34
00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:13.220
What will he do next?

35
00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:14.140
This poisonous father

36
00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:15.700
It’s so early

37
00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.160
The day he was poisoned was him
