00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:05.470
Send your boss to call me out. Princess, someone is looking for you.

2
00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:06.650
Yu, go get busy.

3
00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.690
Every time I heard a few words about a charity center, my sister was worried.

4
00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:12.770
I haven’t read a few sentences in a day or a book of Yiyi,

5
00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:14.490
If you accidentally kill someone.

6
00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:17.770
I'm just afraid that if someone says something to me, someone will kill me.

7
00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:19.950
I opened a charity clinic to treat diseases and save people.

8
00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:23.470
But they all say that what kind of people will have what kind of ideas.

9
00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.390
Yes, it would kill you to do something all day long.

10
00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:27.760
Could it be that you are this kind of person?

11
00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:28.980
That's not what my sister meant.

12
00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:32.880
The younger sister is just worried about her elder sister's carelessness and her life in the grass.

13
00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.880
What if my sister is unhappy?

14
00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:36.400
Sister, accomplice my sister

15
00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:40.050
My sister is unhappy when she looks at me with every eye.

16
00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.460
They are all out to do business.

17
00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.520
No matter how helpless the guest is,

18
00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:44.890
I won't be angry

19
00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.140
But in my store

20
00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:49.220
People who come to cause trouble are never welcome

21
00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:50.860
If my sister doesn’t buy something,

22
00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:51.920
Just please go back

23
00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:53.900
One person, one person, killed my wife

24
00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:55.840
You should kill someone

25
00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:57.720
Oh my wife
