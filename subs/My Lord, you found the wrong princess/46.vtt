00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.880
Why did he start protecting his love wolf so quickly?

2
00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:07.800
I found that if you no longer believe it

3
00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.500
you must be a good writer

4
00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:12.440
You don’t know what you’ve been thinking about all day

5
00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:14.480
What kind of nonsense are you talking about? Get out of the way

6
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:17.860
Wait until I smash this man again

7
00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:20.300
She shouldn't smash this emperor

8
00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:21.830
This stage is the disease of the second sister-in-law

9
00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:23.710
Second sister-in-law’s one is a pipe material

10
00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:25.400
The comparison to the main topic is much better.

11
00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:26.220
What is the second brother doing?

12
00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:27.950
Have you gone to live with your second sister-in-law again?

13
00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:32.420
Achievement depends on looking at it and looking at it

14
00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:33.560
Did the second brother misunderstand something?

15
00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.930
Just talking to my second sister-in-law

16
00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.940
But I dare not grow up lightly in vain

17
00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:39.400
The second sister-in-law is not a casual person either.

18
00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:41.150
Second brother, don’t get me wrong.

19
00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:43.700
The emperor is right, I heard

20
00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:45.020
You recently married the second young master

21
00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:46.340
Rumor has it that the second young son is accompanying him

22
00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:48.220
Second brother, don’t forget that time

23
00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:51.760
But it was the Second Young Master who came here specially to propose marriage.

24
00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:52.620
You left first

25
00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:55.130
Don’t come too far, second brother, second brother

26
00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:56.190
It’s also a knife to fight with, don’t you believe it?

27
00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:00.980
The Queen Mother married Yunlinlong

28
00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:02.160
Why don't you come out to pick up the chicken?

29
00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.000
How come later?

30
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:03.920
If only my mother knew

31
00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:05.099
I'm really afraid that I won't be insured tomorrow.
