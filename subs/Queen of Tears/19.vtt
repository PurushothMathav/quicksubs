00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:06.930
It's such a coincidence that you've been wronged by others.

2
00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:11.500
Hey, he came to take a seat,

3
00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:15.630
I don’t like it inside, I’m lucky,

4
00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:28.480
Do you have time for Xiaoling to eat?

5
00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.210
No, no one wants it,

6
00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:34.930
He is really married, that is his husband,

7
00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:44.260
I'm done with this, and you'll be lucky enough to do it.

8
00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.170
Yes, because three clothes are said to be useless,

9
00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:51.190
Okay? Brother Su, will you buy it?

10
00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:53.930
I would be so stingy

11
00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.310
I was chatting with you just now, so who is your man?

12
00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:59.200
Be a development partner

13
00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:02.880
Look at me and call me manager

14
00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:04.680
Is it right not to ban streaming?

15
00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:11.490
Although I am your high school classmate

16
00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.870
You have to accompany me to the group reception

17
00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:17.610
Then your services have been purchased for you.

18
00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.500
It all has something to do with my dad.

19
00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.020
My dad was very sad that time

20
00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.200
Now I wish I could pick him up tomorrow without waiting.

21
00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.560
If only we had dealt with this in the past now

22
00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.460
I'm really afraid of you. I have multiple wives.

23
00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.470
What am I doing?

24
00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:44.170
I know we are the most noble species

25
00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:46.850
I don’t like to talk to vague people outside.

26
00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:48.880
I've prepared the sentence for you.

27
00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:51.830
But let me be my girlfriend for once

28
00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.820
You don’t want me to run away with another woman, right?

29
00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:00.330
So what you said?

30
00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:03.050
What am I saying? It's also a union of top green cables?

31
00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:04.710
How could she be chasing my woman?

32
00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:11.030
Take a good look at the car, right?

33
00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:13.410
The Grudge Meeting is held once a year

34
00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.900
Those who are wanted are basically under the age of 29

35
00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.580
Brands with a net worth of over 10 billion

36
00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:20.760
Or looking for cooperation opportunities

37
00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:23.020
Either look for the crime of association

38
00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:38.010
Why do you look so much like my Filipino sister?

39
00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:41.060
Next to him is the main person in the hospital.

40
00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:42.920
I really want to come here Cha Cha

41
00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:45.470
A good thing happened to me last time
