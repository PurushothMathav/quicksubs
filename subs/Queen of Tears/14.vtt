00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:08.360
I would do better in any language test at any stage of continuous ringing.

2
00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.020
I’ve seen Mr. Xiang like this for a long time, but he’s not like me.

3
00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:16.930
No! No! Aren’t you laughing?

4
00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.550
Another miscalculation was chosen among this me.

5
00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:22.050
I will judge me all the time.

6
00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:24.520
It's so small, you can always judge

7
00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:28.600
If I beat you to save you, do I still need to beat you?

8
00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.630
I might be his boss at the Democracy Bureau

9
00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.310
I won’t talk to you soon

10
00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:06.890
Smoking another drinker's shares will make him famous.

11
00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:16.720
It's really like investment shares

12
00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:25.040
You really made me laugh

13
00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.000
Not as good as here

14
00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:32.440
Apologize for stripping your head off
