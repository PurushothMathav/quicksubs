00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:09.010
See how he could do such a thing about the original sword?

2
00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.580
Is there anything better than the blur of practicing online?

3
00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:14.560
Do you just lack a chaotic family or are you just a bastard?

4
00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:16.160
What doesn't your brother have?

5
00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:19.900
Bring me to cook? Otherwise, I'll take you to dinner and you'll be offended!

6
00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:26.320
Where's the lady? We came here on purpose, right?

7
00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.960
Are you still not aware of the sins of marriage that you know how to talk about?

8
00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.280
Can I still be famous?

9
00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:33.560
How can it be so circle?

10
00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.100
I know, I really

11
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.470
.. Oops, right!

12
00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:42.830
Go to the door and see, which one do I really want to show you?

13
00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:44.730
Hey, really

14
00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:59.240
You really left school?

15
00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:01.880
If you have anything to do with me

16
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.780
The heart of a lifelong Xizhou dad

17
00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.880
Still the happiest so far

18
00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:24.320
It's been too long

19
00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.430
I really can't remember

20
00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:30.970
last time i left

21
00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:33.770
Are you feeling a little sad?

22
00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:35.350
This damn blind man

23
00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:37.710
If not for me

24
00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.000
Last time I gave you three dollars worth of money.

25
00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.120
You're a beggar

26
00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:01.980
If I donâ€™t give you this money today,

27
00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:04.020
I'll take your dollar

28
00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.840
Anyway, such rough days

29
00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.300
Then I'll give you a short-lived fall
