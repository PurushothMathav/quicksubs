00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:02.940
Fortunately I picked it up yesterday

2
00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:05.670
Said that the service has not been received yet

3
00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:16.490
Things that the two platforms have absorbed.

4
00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:23.770
Is someone coming?

5
00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.780
Did it happen?

6
00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:30.590
Yes, I have both fire and power,

7
00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:32.490
My wife is awake.

8
00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:34.410
How can I still take care of you?

9
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.120
divorce agreement, but what if,

10
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.420
It's in your hands. I don't even know when you came?

11
00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:43.240
Just came in, come again,

12
00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:46.250
Trouble is here.

13
00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:48.060
What are you holding?

14
00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:49.900
You have to hold the electric meter,

15
00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:00.100
Gone? Gone?
