00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.700
You said they even took the snowman

2
00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:03.966
Yeah damn

3
00:00:03.966 --> 00:00:05.266
Who is it?

4
00:00:05.333 --> 00:00:07.533
Dare to slaughter the face of my Zhao family on the ground

5
00:00:07.533 --> 00:00:08.900
Gotta let him know

6
00:00:09.066 --> 00:00:10.800
This is the sky of Jiangcheng

7
00:00:11.766 --> 00:00:13.900
Brother Zhao, what day is it today?

8
00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:15.700
Why did you remember to call me?

9
00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:18.366
I just came back from Sister Red Star's Turtle Shadow Banquet

10
00:00:18.366 --> 00:00:20.733
What big sister retired

11
00:00:20.733 --> 00:00:21.933
Strange to say

12
00:00:21.933 --> 00:00:23.333
I was one step late.

13
00:00:23.333 --> 00:00:25.066
The eldest sister suddenly left for something

14
00:00:25.066 --> 00:00:26.733
But I heard he didn't retire

15
00:00:26.733 --> 00:00:28.700
By the way, what can I do for you?

16
00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:30.200
Brother Wolf doesn't know something?

17
00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:31.400
My son Kai

18
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.666
Kidnapped by a group of unknown people

19
00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.200
People in Beicheng Project

20
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.533
Please also ask the wolf brother to take action

21
00:00:36.533 --> 00:00:38.333
There must be serious insurance after the event

22
00:00:38.333 --> 00:00:40.566
Brother Zhao is polite, your business is my business

23
00:00:40.566 --> 00:00:41.533
Wait until I go there myself

24
00:00:41.533 --> 00:00:42.733
Must save the eldest nephew

25
00:00:42.733 --> 00:00:45.066
So thank you wolf brother

26
00:00:45.066 --> 00:00:46.800
Hahahaha

27
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.900
Why is this the backer you rely on?

28
00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.200
It's not enough at all. What are you arrogant about?

29
00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.700
Our Zhao family has a lot of chassis.

30
00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:56.500
Call any one and it will kill you

31
00:00:56.866 --> 00:00:59.333
Laugh at me, Lin Nan wants to stay

32
00:00:59.333 --> 00:01:01.766
No one has ever been able to take someone away from me

33
00:01:01.766 --> 00:01:04.366
Tianwang Lao Tzu can't do it either

34
00:01:07.533 --> 00:01:09.366
Who is so big-mouthed?

35
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.833
I'm not afraid of the wind flashing my tongue

36
00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.800
Uncle Wolf, you seem to be my Uncle Wolf
