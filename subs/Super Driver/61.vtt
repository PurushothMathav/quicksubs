00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:01.533
You are the ant

2
00:00:01.533 --> 00:00:02.766
What do you mean?

3
00:00:02.866 --> 00:00:03.666
OK

4
00:00:04.133 --> 00:00:04.966
Just today.

5
00:00:04.966 --> 00:00:06.366
Zhao family for tax evasion

6
00:00:06.366 --> 00:00:07.566
Organize community activities

7
00:00:07.566 --> 00:00:09.133
Kidnapping and more than a dozen other crimes

8
00:00:09.133 --> 00:00:11.500
All the sounds were taken away for investigation

9
00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:13.466
Li Lan, you did all this

10
00:00:13.466 --> 00:00:15.966
That's right, as early as when Zhao Kai tortured Chu Yang

11
00:00:15.966 --> 00:00:17.566
I've already sent someone to investigate

12
00:00:17.566 --> 00:00:20.200
Collected evidence of the Zhao family's crimes over the years

13
00:00:20.266 --> 00:00:21.866
It has been handed over to the Reconnaissance Division

14
00:00:21.866 --> 00:00:24.800
As for the revenge fund you're relying on

15
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.000
It has long been frozen by the Reconnaissance Division

16
00:00:27.166 --> 00:00:29.766
You don't have any chips in your hands now

17
00:00:29.966 --> 00:00:32.566
Hahaha dad

18
00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:33.900
lazy

19
00:00:34.466 --> 00:00:37.166
You are so ruthless that you indulge Zhao Kai

20
00:00:37.166 --> 00:00:39.266
The moment I tortured my servants began

21
00:00:39.266 --> 00:00:41.366
You should have expected today's result

22
00:00:41.366 --> 00:00:44.066
You deserve it all

23
00:00:45.266 --> 00:00:47.166
Sister, I know I was wrong.

24
00:00:47.466 --> 00:00:48.300
I don't dare anymore.

25
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.100
Please give our Zhao family a way to live.

26
00:00:50.133 --> 00:00:51.166
I beg you.

27
00:00:51.366 --> 00:00:55.100
Life is for good people

28
00:00:55.166 --> 00:00:56.466
A leader like you

29
00:00:56.466 --> 00:00:58.300
I don't deserve to live at all

30
00:00:58.300 --> 00:00:59.700
Hahahaha

31
00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.600
Lin Lan lost to you today

32
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.300
I, Zhao Tianba, am in trouble

33
00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:05.966
But I lost.

34
00:01:05.966 --> 00:01:07.966
But you're definitely not winning

35
00:01:08.533 --> 00:01:09.600
What do you mean?

36
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.166
What does old thing mean?

37
00:01:11.166 --> 00:01:14.800
Hahaha, you'll understand soon. Hmm.

38
00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:20.500
Hello

39
00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:22.266
What!
