00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:02.800
Tiger Lord, he is a woman

2
00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:04.000
What are you afraid of him for?

3
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.866
Get someone to kill him

4
00:00:05.933 --> 00:00:07.533
Shut up, bastard

5
00:00:07.533 --> 00:00:10.500
One more word, I'll chop you up and feed you to the fish now

6
00:00:10.533 --> 00:00:13.166
Ah Qiang, you are really a good subordinate.

7
00:00:13.166 --> 00:00:16.333
Even a dog can do whatever it wants

8
00:00:16.333 --> 00:00:17.700
Miss Lin, please don't misunderstand

9
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:20.433
I have nothing to do with these two bastards

10
00:00:22.133 --> 00:00:23.000
It's you.

11
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.300
Every day under the banner of Lao Tzu

12
00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:26.933
Kneel down and apologize to Miss Lin

13
00:00:26.933 --> 00:00:29.166
Otherwise I will kill you now

14
00:00:36.266 --> 00:00:38.133
Sorry, Miss Lin.

15
00:00:38.133 --> 00:00:40.100
Blame Ah Qiang for harvesting today

16
00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.766
Let these two blind dogs hit you

17
00:00:42.766 --> 00:00:44.300
I accept the punishment

18
00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:45.600
Please let me live

19
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:46.866
Since it is a misunderstanding

20
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.333
Will you be stingy?

21
00:00:48.333 --> 00:00:50.933
Well, you put half of the assets of the black tiger

22
00:00:50.933 --> 00:00:52.400
Donate to charity

23
00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:54.033
You're good to go.

24
00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:55.766
Uh, yeah.

25
00:00:55.933 --> 00:00:57.166
Miss Schelling

26
00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.300
When you go back, you must do as you want.

27
00:00:59.333 --> 00:01:00.100
Do more charity

28
00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.966
I will never embarrass you, Miss Lin.

29
00:01:02.966 --> 00:01:05.400
Tiger, you can't leave me alone

30
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.366
Start today.

31
00:01:07.366 --> 00:01:09.966
My black tiger will have nothing to do with you anymore

32
00:01:09.966 --> 00:01:12.100
If you let me know again that you are in my name

33
00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.766
Courage for whom?

34
00:01:12.766 --> 00:01:14.500
I will kill you in minutes

35
00:01:14.966 --> 00:01:15.866
Hey, hey, hey.

36
00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.900
Nonsense nonsense
