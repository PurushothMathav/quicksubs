You are dead.

7
00:00:27.933 --> 00:00:28.933

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.566
I can let you choose a way to die

12
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.366
Do you want to be the first bird?

13
00:00:43.366 --> 00:00:44.600

14
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:45.866

00:00:52.066 --> 00:00:53.933
Just solve them for me.

18
00:00:53.933 --> 00:00:56.433
Do you two have any idea who will die first?

19
00:00:56.933 --> 00:00:58.966
Who will die first?

20
00:00:58.966 --> 00:00:59.766
Golden red

00:01:00.266 --> 00:01:01.233
Play with him

22
00:01:01.733 --> 00:01:03.200
Be merciful.

23
00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.500
Give him a break

24
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.000
Ok big sister

25
00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:08.700
You woman really don't know how to die

26
00:01:08.933 --> 00:01:11.533
I don't think you know anything about death

27
00:01:11.533 --> 00:01:12.866
How to write death

28
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.100

00:01:25.566 --> 00:01:27.566
But Jiang Cheng is one of the best masters

34
00:01:28.466 --> 00:01:30.166
Could be defeated so easily
