00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.666
This feeling of going back on your word and being played

2
00:00:02.666 --> 00:00:04.033
Not feeling good

3
00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:06.666
Do you personally think you are amazing?

4
00:00:06.666 --> 00:00:08.466
You're just relying on the number of people

5
00:00:08.533 --> 00:00:10.200
Kind of give me a call

6
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.333
Can I kill you with anyone?

7
00:00:12.333 --> 00:00:14.666
Can you make a phone call?

8
00:00:16.933 --> 00:00:19.066
Linlang can't give him the phone.

9
00:00:19.133 --> 00:00:20.700
The Zhao family is the local emperor of Jiangcheng

10
00:00:20.733 --> 00:00:21.966
Once you give him the phone

11
00:00:22.066 --> 00:00:23.866
We're done

12
00:00:23.866 --> 00:00:25.133
Hmph look

13
00:00:25.133 --> 00:00:26.366
It's a sheep. It has vision.

14
00:00:26.366 --> 00:00:28.200
I suggest you kneel down and apologize to me

15
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:29.066
Then let me go

16
00:00:29.066 --> 00:00:30.600
You can let my dad save your life

17
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:31.400
otherwise

18
00:00:31.966 --> 00:00:34.900
Zhao Kai is dying, and you are still stubborn

19
00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:35.733
Don't say it's you

20
00:00:35.733 --> 00:00:36.500
Even you

21
00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.666
The entire Zhao family is in front of the eldest sister

22
00:00:38.666 --> 00:00:40.200
Just a character

23
00:00:41.266 --> 00:00:42.466
Chu Yang, don't worry.

24
00:00:42.466 --> 00:00:43.466
You have my energy

25
00:00:43.466 --> 00:00:45.766
Enough to ensure that you and Yaoyao are not hurt by anyone

26
00:00:45.766 --> 00:00:47.200
Want to call

27
00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.400
Okay, that depends on your own skills.

28
00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.166
Don't you like Fo Tan very much?

29
00:00:56.166 --> 00:00:57.200
How about this?

30
00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:00.500
How many coals can you count in this pot?

31
00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.033
I'll let you make this call

32
00:01:06.166 --> 00:01:09.233
123 Who made you so miserable?

33
00:01:09.333 --> 00:01:11.300
Give me piece by piece and take it out and say

34
00:01:11.666 --> 00:01:13.666
Women are not easy, right?

35
00:01:14.566 --> 00:01:16.133
Anyway, the opportunity has been given to you

36
00:01:16.133 --> 00:01:18.800
Whether or not it's your own business

37
00:01:20.333 --> 00:01:22.000
Since Mr. Zhao is unwilling

38
00:01:22.533 --> 00:01:24.200
Then you can continue to play with him

39
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.100
I don't say don't say don't say don't say don't say
