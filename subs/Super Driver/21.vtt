00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.533
Game rules

2
00:00:01.533 --> 00:00:02.500
Very simple.

3
00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:05.500
Hanging around your neck is a stop sling switch

4
00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:06.966
The other one is in Qinghong

5
00:00:06.966 --> 00:00:09.166
You losers are standing there

6
00:00:09.166 --> 00:00:11.133
Hurry up and grab it to save this young master

7
00:00:11.133 --> 00:00:12.500
Don't scold them yet

8
00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:15.500
After all, your life is in their hands

9
00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:16.300
What do you mean?

10
00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:17.066
Put a lot

11
00:00:17.066 --> 00:00:18.800
Don't interrupt me.

12
00:00:21.533 --> 00:00:24.266
In a while, the fire will press the switch

13
00:00:24.466 --> 00:00:26.100
The rope will slowly come down

14
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:27.366
Only you

15
00:00:27.366 --> 00:00:30.166
Just go find something and hit that switch

16
00:00:30.166 --> 00:00:32.100
But if you can't do that

17
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:34.566
Your master's life is gone

18
00:00:34.933 --> 00:00:36.100
You want to kill me?

19
00:00:36.166 --> 00:00:37.500
You stinky woman

20
00:00:37.533 --> 00:00:38.766
The game itself is not played

21
00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:40.066
You can ask them to let me go

22
00:00:40.066 --> 00:00:42.866
Shut up, the rules set by big sister

23
00:00:43.133 --> 00:00:45.200
No bargaining qualification

24
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.400
Or play to the death?

25
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:48.700
You choose.

26
00:00:48.766 --> 00:00:49.800
You bastards

27
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.266
Do you really want to watch this young master die?

28
00:00:51.266 --> 00:00:53.766
Quick answer, who can hit the 100,000 given by this young master
