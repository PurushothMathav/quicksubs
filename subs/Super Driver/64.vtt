1
00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.533
Something inferior

2
00:00:01.533 --> 00:00:04.133
Qin Huang, you are just a dog next to you

3
00:00:04.133 --> 00:00:06.000
What right do you have to scold me Ah Kun?

4
00:00:06.333 --> 00:00:08.333
Stop it, for the sake of brothers

5
00:00:08.333 --> 00:00:09.800
Big sister will be open to you

6
00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:11.866
Haonan, shut the fuck up

7
00:00:11.866 --> 00:00:14.433
I despise you the most in the whole Red Star

8
00:00:14.466 --> 00:00:15.833
Obviously capable

9
00:00:15.866 --> 00:00:17.466
Gotta be a dog to this woman

10
00:00:17.466 --> 00:00:19.466
Ah Kun, you are going too far.

11
00:00:20.066 --> 00:00:21.700
The eldest sister is in love with us

12
00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:23.100
How can you say that about him?

13
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.833
Lin Lan, save Yaoyao

14
00:00:25.466 --> 00:00:26.633
Do not come

15
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.600
But don't go and kill my daughter

16
00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:30.966
Is that right?

17
00:00:30.966 --> 00:00:34.000
Now that's a motherly attitude.

18
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.866
Hahahaha

19
00:00:35.866 --> 00:00:37.400
Bastard let my daughter go

20
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:38.700
I'll be your hostage

21
00:00:38.733 --> 00:00:39.900
You are Lin Lan's trash

22
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.900
Husband, what kind of sweet dreams do you stinky cripple have?

23
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.366
Now this little blind man is my talisman

24
00:00:45.566 --> 00:00:46.766
You father and daughter

25
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.233
A cripple and a blind man

26
00:00:49.766 --> 00:00:51.200
It's weird

27
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:52.500
Hahahaha

28
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:53.366
Miao Kun

29
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.500
I, Lin Lan, think you don't care about these times

30
00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:57.566
Why did you ask my lord to betray me?

31
00:00:57.566 --> 00:00:58.966
Who betrayed whom?

32
00:00:58.966 --> 00:01:00.333
I, Aquila, fight for myself

33
00:01:00.333 --> 00:01:01.200
Am I wrong?

34
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.600
I, Aqua, am never wrong.

35
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.666
Wrong is you, is that you?
