00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.100
You're finished.

2
00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:02.300
My uncle Wolf has a habit

3
00:00:02.366 --> 00:00:03.600
Just tremble all over

4
00:00:03.766 --> 00:00:05.800
If you are angry, you are dead

5
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:08.000
I think he is blind.

6
00:00:08.333 --> 00:00:11.400
How dare they look down on you

7
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.066
Teach him a lesson and let them know how good you are

8
00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:16.600
Uncle Wolf, don't you like hot hands and flowers the most?

9
00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:19.766
Do you think this woman is not the government and your appetite?

10
00:00:19.766 --> 00:00:20.566
Ah!

11
00:00:21.166 --> 00:00:23.500
Uncle Wolf beat you to death, you little bastard

12
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:25.366
Do you know who that is?

13
00:00:25.366 --> 00:00:27.466
Do you want me to die early?

14
00:00:28.266 --> 00:00:29.166
Uh-huh.

15
00:00:30.466 --> 00:00:32.800
Miss Li, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

16
00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.333
I really didn't know it was you.

17
00:00:34.333 --> 00:00:35.866
If I had known it was you

18
00:00:35.866 --> 00:00:38.300
Lend me 10 guts, I dare not offend you.

19
00:00:38.366 --> 00:00:41.000
Mouse, why are you kneeling down for this woman?

20
00:00:41.466 --> 00:00:43.566
Someone they killed me

21
00:00:43.566 --> 00:00:44.133
Liar

22
00:00:44.133 --> 00:00:47.600
Shut up for me, your Nanshan Wolf is so majestic now

23
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.266
You are more majestic than me now

24
00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:50.800
Dare to hit me

25
00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:52.533
Miss Li Miss Li

26
00:00:52.533 --> 00:00:53.533
This is a misunderstanding.

27
00:00:53.533 --> 00:00:55.933
A misunderstanding is a misunderstanding

28
00:00:55.933 --> 00:00:58.500
I have nothing to do with their parry

29
00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.800
Please, please give me a way out

30
00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.033
Miss Li lives

31
00:01:02.166 --> 00:01:04.000
Well, it's cold this year.

32
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:04.966
Before the end of the year

33
00:01:04.966 --> 00:01:07.166
Don't let your brothers go to sea to do business
