00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:01.166
Liangkun you bastard

2
00:00:01.166 --> 00:00:03.333
You actually have a relationship with the Zhao family

3
00:00:03.333 --> 00:00:04.766
It's really thrown into my red star's face

4
00:00:04.766 --> 00:00:05.833
So what?

5
00:00:05.933 --> 00:00:07.666
Everything I do is for Red Star

6
00:00:07.666 --> 00:00:09.766
Am I wrong to want Red Star to make more money?

7
00:00:09.766 --> 00:00:10.566
And clear

8
00:00:10.566 --> 00:00:11.966
You have no heart

9
00:00:11.966 --> 00:00:14.133
Do you want to replace Yinglan as the eldest sister of Red Star?

10
00:00:14.133 --> 00:00:17.466
Ah, it's just me, Ah Kun, who made this happen.

11
00:00:17.466 --> 00:00:19.500
Ah Kun, what nonsense are you talking about?

12
00:00:19.766 --> 00:00:21.500
You thought we would be like you

13
00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:22.600
Betray big sister?

14
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.666
Brothers, think about it

15
00:00:24.666 --> 00:00:25.066
Red Star

16
00:00:25.066 --> 00:00:27.066
It's our brother and big brother step by step

17
00:00:27.066 --> 00:00:27.900
walked out

18
00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.000
Why is this little girl

19
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.500
You can directly come and take the seat of the eldest sister.

20
00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.733
Why are you presumptuous, Ah Kun?

21
00:00:32.733 --> 00:00:34.866
The ability of the eldest sister is obvious to all

22
00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:36.500
Besides, he is the only daughter of the eldest brother.

23
00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.400
He deserves to be the successor to Red Star

24
00:00:38.533 --> 00:00:40.700
How many years has the Qing Dynasty been dead?

25
00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.366
Also play the Dead City Maple Leaf set with me

26
00:00:42.366 --> 00:00:44.100
On Means Theory Ability

27
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.000
What's better than me?

28
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.766
You and I will do the position of the top leader of the Red Army, Ah Kun

29
00:00:48.766 --> 00:00:50.733
Ah Kun, look back

30
00:00:50.733 --> 00:00:52.266
Below are all the brothers of Red Star

31
00:00:52.266 --> 00:00:53.700
For the sake of brothers

32
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.266
We'll plead for you, don't give me this set

33
00:00:56.666 --> 00:00:57.600
What's there to escape?

34
00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.466
Accuse you of following him like this?

35
00:00:59.466 --> 00:01:00.300
Liang Kun

36
00:01:00.366 --> 00:01:02.800
I'm giving you one more chance to release my daughter

37
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.700
I can let go of the past

38
00:01:04.766 --> 00:01:06.600
I can't let you out of this door

39
00:01:07.933 --> 00:01:11.366
Mom and Dad hahahahaha

40
00:01:11.766 --> 00:01:13.566
Sister, you know

41
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.600
What bothers me the most is when people threaten me

42
00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:21.100
Do you want to see this little blind man die?
