00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:02.800
I, Lin Lan, can also cut the sky in one sentence

2
00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:05.900
Lin Lan, I know you are a salute

3
00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:08.333
But so what? You can't kill me

4
00:00:08.333 --> 00:00:11.000
You think my Zhao family has dominated Jiangcheng for decades

5
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.700
Is that what you rely on?

6
00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:13.566
What do you mean?

7
00:00:13.566 --> 00:00:16.000
I have already given it to me and my children

8
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.966
Bought a revenge fund

9
00:00:17.966 --> 00:00:19.900
The amount is 1 billion

10
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.800
In the event of an accident between me and my children

11
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.100
The revenge fund will not be launched

12
00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:27.100
Then the global killer

13
00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:29.600
Will hunt down you and those around you

14
00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.800
Even if you have the whole red star behind you

15
00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:34.633
But you still end up dead

16
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.166
Hahaha, divide it.

17
00:00:37.266 --> 00:00:39.600
You have such a good trump card, why didn't you say it earlier?

18
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:40.800
You see scares me

19
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.366
Lin Lan, what if your eyesight is terrible?

20
00:00:44.366 --> 00:00:47.200
Letting us go is your only way out

21
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.200
Zhao Tianba, you old fox is really cunning

22
00:00:52.533 --> 00:00:55.066
No wonder you can thrive in Jiangcheng

23
00:00:55.066 --> 00:00:56.800
I didn't expect it, I didn't expect it.

24
00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.800
The mighty eldest sister also has times to give in

25
00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.600
This is really my honor, Zhao Tianba

26
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.566
Ahahahaha

27
00:01:04.566 --> 00:01:07.900
Sister, aren't you so-called hand-eye?

28
00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:09.666
That's all you need to know.

29
00:01:09.666 --> 00:01:10.766
Didn't you say

30
00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.000
Is threatening your family your bottom line?

31
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.466
Hey, I'm in danger.

32
00:01:15.133 --> 00:01:16.400
Am I still fine?

33
00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.433
Ahahahaha

34
00:01:18.466 --> 00:01:21.733
Zhao Tianba, I advise you to be a man in one sentence

35
00:01:21.733 --> 00:01:22.866
Don't be too confident

36
00:01:22.866 --> 00:01:24.700
After all, the world of ants is small

37
00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.766
It's hard to see through things.

38
00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.200
And in my eyes?

39
00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.666
You are the ant
