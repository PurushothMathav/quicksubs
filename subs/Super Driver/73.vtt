00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:05.166
Mom, you scared me to death!

2
00:00:05.966 --> 00:00:07.600
Somebody get my mom to the hospital

3
00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:08.466
Big sister

4
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.633
Fortunately, woman, we prepared an air cushion in advance

5
00:00:10.666 --> 00:00:12.666
Let go of me, I'm the red star boss

6
00:00:12.766 --> 00:00:14.200
You should all listen to me

7
00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:14.866
Immortal you

8
00:00:14.866 --> 00:00:16.966
Let go of my big sister

9
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.300
Ah Kun, this dog deserves death

10
00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:20.133
Please stop

11
00:00:20.133 --> 00:00:22.200
I am not guilty, it is you who are guilty

12
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:23.000
Ah Kun

13
00:00:23.533 --> 00:00:25.733
Are you still not mistaken?

14
00:00:25.733 --> 00:00:26.766
I am not wrong

15
00:00:26.766 --> 00:00:28.866
Everything I do is for hearts

16
00:00:28.866 --> 00:00:30.466
I'm right, Ah Kun

17
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.500
I actually thought about giving the hearts to you

18
00:00:33.566 --> 00:00:34.866
But I didn't expect it.

19
00:00:34.866 --> 00:00:36.466
You've done so much illegal work behind my back

20
00:00:36.466 --> 00:00:37.500
Ji's business

21
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.066
I hope you can understand

22
00:00:39.066 --> 00:00:41.000
My father's original intention of founding Hearts

23
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.200
It's for the good of society.

24
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:43.800
Rather than fighting

25
00:00:43.866 --> 00:00:46.833
Hand over Ah Kong to the Reconnaissance Division to undertake according to law

26
00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.833
Eldest sister, people like Ah Kun deserve it

27
00:00:52.166 --> 00:00:53.600
You don't have to feel sorry for him

28
00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:54.400
cyan

29
00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.133
You say money

30
00:00:56.133 --> 00:00:58.900
Can power really make people lose themselves?

31
00:00:58.933 --> 00:01:02.166
Don't you often say but do good deeds and don't ask about your future?

32
00:01:02.266 --> 00:01:03.833
The road is chosen by yourself
