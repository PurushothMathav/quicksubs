1
00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.200
From the moment we got divorced

2
00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:05.066
You and I have nothing to do with each other

3
00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:09.866
Wife, who is he?

4
00:00:09.866 --> 00:00:10.666
Chuyang

5
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:12.700
Let's get a divorce.

6
00:00:13.533 --> 00:00:14.333
you

7
00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:16.400
What do you mean by that?

8
00:00:17.166 --> 00:00:19.433
After three years of marriage, you achieved nothing

9
00:00:19.566 --> 00:00:21.800
You're a loser in my eyes

10
00:00:21.866 --> 00:00:24.000
I won't marry you until I'm blind

11
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.933
So you did it for the old man?

12
00:00:25.933 --> 00:00:27.200
Just chose to divorce me

13
00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.200
So what if I was?

14
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.466
He can give me everything I want, can you?

15
00:00:32.566 --> 00:00:34.666
Okay, I'm too lazy to talk nonsense with you

16
00:00:34.666 --> 00:00:35.800
Sign quickly

17
00:00:36.333 --> 00:00:39.500
Chu Yang, listen to me 77 years ago

18
00:00:41.366 --> 00:00:43.800
You are lazy, I don't have time.

19
00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:45.566
I don't want to hear your explanation

20
00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:46.833
Oh, right.

21
00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.666
You should be at home now, your wife

22
00:00:49.666 --> 00:00:51.933
Instead of wasting time with me here

23
00:00:51.933 --> 00:00:52.733
Chu Ya

24
00:00:52.866 --> 00:00:55.000
Now is not the time for you to get emotional with me

25
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.133
Yaoyao blind

26
00:00:56.133 --> 00:00:58.466
The extreme delay is enough to cure his eyes

27
00:00:58.466 --> 00:00:59.266
Groom

28
00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:01.900
Yaoyao's eyes

29
00:01:02.266 --> 00:01:03.633
I'll find a way.

30
00:01:04.066 --> 00:01:05.233
As for you

31
00:01:05.333 --> 00:01:07.966
When you choose to go with that old man

32
00:01:07.966 --> 00:01:10.300
She is no longer worthy to be Yaoyao's mother

33
00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.666
No, it's not what you think.

34
00:01:12.666 --> 00:01:13.900
If I hadn't left

35
00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:15.966
You and Yaoyao are both in danger

36
00:01:15.966 --> 00:01:18.233
I've had enough, I still have the game

37
00:01:18.333 --> 00:01:19.500
Hope you later

38
00:01:19.966 --> 00:01:21.300
Don't bother us anymore

39
00:01:23.333 --> 00:01:25.400
I know you're still mad at me.

40
00:01:25.733 --> 00:01:27.666
But Yaoyao's eyes can't hold back

41
00:01:27.766 --> 00:01:29.366
Take the money

42
00:01:30.366 --> 00:01:31.300
Your money.

43
00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.666
I think it's dirty to give Yaoyao the money for eye treatment.

44
00:01:35.666 --> 00:01:38.833
I will use my hands to earn my teeth

45
00:01:40.133 --> 00:01:42.800
I owe you and Yaoyao these 7 years

46
00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.333
But now I'm back.

47
00:01:44.333 --> 00:01:47.066
I will do everything I can to make up for you.

48
00:01:48.333 --> 00:01:51.033
If you encounter any trouble in Jiangcheng in the future

49
00:01:51.866 --> 00:01:53.100
Just a phone call.

50
00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.533
Even if you provoke the sky

51
00:01:54.533 --> 00:01:56.233
I also have the ability to break the sky with you
