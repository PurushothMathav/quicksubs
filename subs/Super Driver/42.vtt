00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:02.066
You're finally here.

2
00:00:02.066 --> 00:00:03.400
Look what that woman did to me

3
00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:04.600
Are you going to avenge me?

4
00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:06.133
How dare you

5
00:00:06.133 --> 00:00:07.966
How could you beat my brother like this?

6
00:00:08.166 --> 00:00:09.433
Just a piece of trash

7
00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:10.666
If you hit it, you will hit it.

8
00:00:10.666 --> 00:00:12.166
Do you know who I am?

9
00:00:12.166 --> 00:00:13.800
How dare you talk to me like that

10
00:00:14.266 --> 00:00:17.300
Tell you my wife is from Red Star

11
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:18.766
You kneel down and beg for mercy now

12
00:00:18.766 --> 00:00:20.466
I can spare your lives

13
00:00:20.966 --> 00:00:23.133
Immediately kneel down and apologize to my brother

14
00:00:23.133 --> 00:00:25.266
Then give out 20 million as compensation

15
00:00:25.266 --> 00:00:27.500
I can also consider sparing your lives

16
00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:31.333
I will make you regret what you did today.

17
00:00:31.333 --> 00:00:33.800
When did the red star make you so disrespected

18
00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.866
Garbage income that only bullies people

19
00:00:35.866 --> 00:00:37.800
It seems that Red Star has really fallen

20
00:00:37.866 --> 00:00:39.100
You woman

21
00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:40.466
How dare you insult Red Star

22
00:00:40.533 --> 00:00:42.400
I will make your life worse than death

23
00:00:43.533 --> 00:00:44.866
Before joining Red Star

24
00:00:44.866 --> 00:00:46.566
Didn't anyone teach you how to speak?

25
00:00:46.566 --> 00:00:48.033
You

26
00:00:48.133 --> 00:00:49.333
How dare you hit me?

27
00:00:49.333 --> 00:00:50.900
I'm going to kill you!

28
00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:51.966
Come on.

29
00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.000
It is easy to hurt the body if you are so angry, so what?

30
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.700
I'll have some fun with you guys

31
00:01:00.066 --> 00:01:01.733
Sister, help me!

32
00:01:01.733 --> 00:01:04.466
Sister, wife, save me, what do you want to do?

33
00:01:04.466 --> 00:01:05.533
Let them go

34
00:01:05.533 --> 00:01:08.900
Otherwise, you won't be able to get out of this door today.
