1
00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:06.433
They all wrote the words to break up with me

2
00:00:12.533 --> 00:00:15.366
Your Majesty's Consort has arrived

3
00:00:16.133 --> 00:00:17.566
See your majesty

4
00:00:18.166 --> 00:00:20.200
Exonerated Guiyang

5
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.066
You have made great contributions

6
00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:24.566
I am discussing with you

7
00:00:24.733 --> 00:00:26.633
Grant you the position of waiter of the army

8
00:00:26.966 --> 00:00:29.433
Let you assist Lord Xing

9
00:00:30.533 --> 00:00:32.300
Now people are divided.

10
00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:35.100
The prince is talented

11
00:00:35.666 --> 00:00:38.066
Without him, there would be no Beijing Street

12
00:00:38.333 --> 00:00:39.266
Without him

13
00:00:39.266 --> 00:00:41.766
It will not solve the Southeast flood so quickly

14
00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.600
Therefore, it is not the position of Shilang that belongs to him

15
00:00:45.266 --> 00:00:46.566
Qin Feiyang

16
00:00:47.533 --> 00:00:49.766
No experience in combat

17
00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:51.500
So young

18
00:00:51.966 --> 00:00:54.400
I'm afraid it can't float.

19
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.100
The father and the sons and daughters think this is absolutely unacceptable

20
00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.300
Your Majesty is a subject

21
00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:07.100
What the third prince said is gone

22
00:01:07.866 --> 00:01:12.066
Since ancient and modern times, there has been no precedent for the consort to serve as the waiter of the Ministry of War

23
00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:16.066
Kong caused controversy among the courtiers

24
00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.066
No Qin Feiyang

25
00:01:19.566 --> 00:01:21.566
You can handle the Beijing Warriors

26
00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:22.800
And you.

27
00:01:23.766 --> 00:01:25.066
Southeast flood

28
00:01:25.266 --> 00:01:28.233
Without Qin Feiyang, you can properly solve it.

29
00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.000
I know the Third Prince and Lord Xing

30
00:01:32.066 --> 00:01:33.900
They don't want me involved in military affairs

31
00:01:34.933 --> 00:01:36.966
Your Majesty is gracious

32
00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.033
The wings have never been suitable for the son

33
00:01:40.066 --> 00:01:41.300
That's all.

34
00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:45.000
The crown of tribute from the Western Regions

35
00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:47.633
Obey

36
00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.266
It's called Phoenix Creek.

37
00:02:00.866 --> 00:02:03.233
It is a priceless treasure of the royal family in the Western Regions

38
00:02:03.666 --> 00:02:06.566
I will bestow upon you today
