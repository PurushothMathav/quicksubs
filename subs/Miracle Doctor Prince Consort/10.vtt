1
00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:02.866
It's called the guitar.

2
00:00:02.966 --> 00:00:04.300
The princess likes it

3
00:00:04.333 --> 00:00:05.866
Let alone a musical instrument

4
00:00:06.066 --> 00:00:07.800
Even if I give it all

5
00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.833
Princess princess

6
00:00:10.766 --> 00:00:12.500
You are fascinated.

7
00:00:16.733 --> 00:00:19.633
The first round of competition ends here

8
00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:21.566
Which genius wins?

9
00:00:21.566 --> 00:00:23.900
Princess has her own decision

10
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.266
The second round of contempt is for the young masters and geniuses

11
00:00:28.366 --> 00:00:31.200
Tibetan in poetry, calligraphy and painting

12
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.766
The princess asked the question herself

13
00:00:33.766 --> 00:00:37.000
Please get ready

14
00:00:37.533 --> 00:00:39.000
Count your life

15
00:00:39.466 --> 00:00:42.100
What poetry, calligraphy and painting can you compare to?

16
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.700
The princess will definitely love me

17
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.400
Go back as soon as possible

18
00:00:47.333 --> 00:00:49.000
Who gave you that confidence?

19
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.366
This round of princesses is ugly

20
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.966
Unlike musical instruments, which can be prepared in advance

21
00:00:54.133 --> 00:00:55.333
You can't win.

22
00:00:55.333 --> 00:00:58.033
The princess must be me

23
00:00:58.266 --> 00:01:03.200
Are you worthy? It's really a little prince who likes to make a fool of himself

24
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.800
The second round of competition begins immediately

25
00:01:10.933 --> 00:01:12.166
Ladies and gentlemen

26
00:01:12.166 --> 00:01:16.166
Choose one of the forms of poetry, calligraphy and painting

27
00:01:16.166 --> 00:01:18.066
Depict Princess Linglong

28
00:01:18.066 --> 00:01:20.433
Reality a stick of incense
