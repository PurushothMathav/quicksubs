00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.633
Ugly last night

2
00:00:01.666 --> 00:00:04.200
Suddenly I heard His Majesty shout

3
00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.000
When the old slave arrived

4
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.600
His Majesty has spat blood

5
00:00:08.766 --> 00:00:12.166
Then he started talking nonsense.

6
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.666
The state is crazy

7
00:00:14.866 --> 00:00:16.433
Who did His Majesty see last night?

8
00:00:16.533 --> 00:00:17.500
What foods have you eaten?

9
00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:18.500
List in detail

10
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:22.100
Yes

11
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:25.666
How's it going?

12
00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:50.166
Pulse disorder

13
00:00:50.166 --> 00:00:51.166
Activate the attack center

14
00:00:51.166 --> 00:00:52.033
Purple tongue coating

15
00:00:52.133 --> 00:00:53.833
Combine the symptoms described by the public

16
00:00:53.966 --> 00:00:55.966
It doesn't look like any documented disease at all.

17
00:00:55.966 --> 00:00:57.400
More like a serious illness

18
00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.300
The third prince and the imperial doctor magpie are here

19
00:01:03.966 --> 00:01:05.000
let go

20
00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:07.666
get out of the way

21
00:01:08.366 --> 00:01:10.366
You're just a nephew

22
00:01:10.666 --> 00:01:12.866
You really think of yourself as a miracle doctor

23
00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:17.100
The emperor's medical doctors have informed me

24
00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:18.566
As far as I can see

25
00:01:18.566 --> 00:01:20.700
The emperor's illness is extremely rare

26
00:01:20.733 --> 00:01:22.833
Because of impatient ions

27
00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:25.833
However, I urgently discuss with the imperial physicians

28
00:01:25.966 --> 00:01:27.866
The emperor's disease can be cured

29
00:01:28.666 --> 00:01:30.900
Here's the prescription I just wrote

30
00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.600
Find a room to get medicine

31
00:01:34.533 --> 00:01:35.900
The prescription you wrote

32
00:01:36.766 --> 00:01:38.266
What do you mean?

33
00:01:39.866 --> 00:01:42.000
Magpie is the head of the imperial physicians in the palace

34
00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:42.900
His life

35
00:01:43.466 --> 00:01:44.633
Impossible from now on

36
00:01:45.333 --> 00:01:48.500
It's not enough for you to die a hundred times after delaying His Majesty's illness
