00:00:15.366 --> 00:00:16.166
lion

2
00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:18.100
Could the two assassins last night be

3
00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:20.000
Impossible, it's even down

4
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.400
Why does the princess bother?

5
00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:22.666
Send someone to drown me

6
00:00:24.333 --> 00:00:27.600
This father's will is only to suspend the marriage contract

7
00:00:27.666 --> 00:00:29.000
Not abolished

8
00:00:29.166 --> 00:00:31.400
But Qin Feiyang is a complete waste

9
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.100
She's pretty.

10
00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.133
Her Royal Highness, don't worry

11
00:00:35.133 --> 00:00:38.200
That innocent Qin Feiyang has long been notorious

12
00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:41.600
The emperor will definitely take care of the royal face

13
00:00:41.666 --> 00:00:44.433
Princess, I have a solution

14
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:45.900
How?

15
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:47.866
The princess may propose to the emperor

16
00:00:47.866 --> 00:00:49.500
Hold a recruitment conference on another day

17
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.066
Swear to death must participate

18
00:00:51.066 --> 00:00:52.300
If you don't want to marry

19
00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:53.833
I still want to be in public, brother

20
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:55.733
It's really a killing intention

21
00:00:55.733 --> 00:00:59.200
Maybe the princess can choose a good match

22
00:00:59.266 --> 00:01:01.200
Isn't it killing two birds with one stone?

23
00:01:07.733 --> 00:01:09.400
That's a good idea. Hmm.

24
00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.200
I'm going to ask to see Phoenix tomorrow, okay?

25
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.900
Then princess, we should go to the bath to relieve fatigue

26
00:01:25.066 --> 00:01:27.233
I didn't say I wanted to see it on purpose
