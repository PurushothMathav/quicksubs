00:00:01.733 --> 00:00:02.866
Just what?

2
00:00:05.166 --> 00:00:08.366
It's just that you're going to continue kneeling on the washboard tonight

3
00:00:08.366 --> 00:00:11.166
Kneel until this princess is satisfied before getting up

4
00:00:11.933 --> 00:00:13.366
Work, please.

5
00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:15.366
Can you change the punishment?

6
00:00:16.666 --> 00:00:18.466
Hmm, no.

7
00:00:34.366 --> 00:00:35.633
Middle Road Consort

8
00:00:36.133 --> 00:00:37.200
I heard about this year's lantern festival

9
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.966
Some unexpected red oranges and milliliters

10
00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:40.233
Will come to the palace

11
00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.200
Much more lively than in previous years

12
00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:53.133
Liu Shishi asked me to meet again tonight

13
00:00:53.133 --> 00:00:54.166
I don't know

14
00:00:54.166 --> 00:00:56.200
Is he willing to tell the truth he created?

15
00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:57.000
fly

16
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.200
What are you thinking about?

17
00:01:01.133 --> 00:01:02.000
Nothing.

18
00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.400
Is there no need to guess lantern riddles at the lantern fair?

19
00:01:04.766 --> 00:01:06.600
Let the princess see tonight

20
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.200
How hurried is the cultivation of the concubine?

21
00:01:10.166 --> 00:01:11.000
Maybe.

22
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.200
You can't compare to ordinary people

23
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.600
Third brother, are you here to watch the lantern festival too?

24
00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:24.600
Yes!

25
00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:27.366
This prince of the official imperial capital is here

26
00:01:27.366 --> 00:01:29.000
How could I not?

27
00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:29.900
Xiaowuqin

28
00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.300
How can I hear something in your words?

29
00:01:32.533 --> 00:01:34.366
The third prince is busy with the doctor all day

30
00:01:35.366 --> 00:01:37.566
There are still idle unions participating in the lantern fair

31
00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.466
It really confused the ghosts
