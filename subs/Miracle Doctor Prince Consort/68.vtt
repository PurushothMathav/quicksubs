1
00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:05.900
The third brother will start over there

2
00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:07.400
I'm going to take a look now

3
00:00:31.266 --> 00:00:34.700
You need to leave half and type half

4
00:00:37.866 --> 00:00:39.833
Need half keep half

5
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.066
What do you mean?

6
00:00:41.666 --> 00:00:42.966
Is it a melon?

7
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.666
I only eat half at a time.

8
00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:50.666
I have to stay for the other half at night to eat hahaha

9
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:53.833
Maybe it's rice.

10
00:00:53.933 --> 00:00:56.633
I can only eat half a bowl every time.

11
00:00:58.766 --> 00:01:00.900
I guess it must be money

12
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.766
Isn't money just half used and half kept?

13
00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.266
No no no I guess it's food

14
00:01:06.266 --> 00:01:08.700
Don't you panic if you have surplus food at home?

15
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.633
Can't you guess?

16
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.166
Who just bragged about his literary talent?

17
00:01:18.533 --> 00:01:20.766
Hey, he is the prince, Qin Feiyang

18
00:01:20.766 --> 00:01:23.100
It's not that I heard that he repeatedly saw the void for the court

19
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.333
Talent unmatched

20
00:01:24.333 --> 00:01:26.000
I can't even guess a lantern riddle.

21
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:26.900
Yes!

22
00:01:26.933 --> 00:01:30.766
It's just like that when I see you today, hahaha.
