1
00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:03.033
As expected of the third prince who strategizes

2
00:00:04.466 --> 00:00:05.500
It's you who dies

3
00:00:05.866 --> 00:00:07.633
How can you still be so calm?

4
00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:10.000
Thinking about helping to reverse black and white

5
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.600
This prince is just talking about saving the world

6
00:00:14.066 --> 00:00:17.433
The person who reverses black and white, I think it's you?

7
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.100
Stop arguing.

8
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:23.933
right and wrong

9
00:00:23.933 --> 00:00:26.000
I will make my own judgment

10
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.300
After all, after many years

11
00:00:28.333 --> 00:00:30.566
Impossible with just one letter

12
00:00:30.566 --> 00:00:32.466
The crime of causing Lord Xing

13
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.266
The following famous names

14
00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.166
Your Majesty's fame

15
00:00:43.066 --> 00:00:44.100
Your Majesty

16
00:00:44.866 --> 00:00:46.766
In addition to this letter and physical evidence

17
00:00:46.766 --> 00:00:48.000
There are witnesses

18
00:00:48.133 --> 00:00:49.666
How could there be any witnesses?

19
00:00:49.766 --> 00:00:52.866
Could it be that people teach

20
00:00:56.133 --> 00:00:58.033
You can't imagine it anyway

21
00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.066
My father died tragically

22
00:01:00.066 --> 00:01:02.033
No one survived the micro-battle

23
00:01:02.133 --> 00:01:03.500
Who else can serve as a minister for me?

24
00:01:07.966 --> 00:01:09.966
Father Ren Zhengyu arrives

25
00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:14.800
Your Majesty

26
00:01:15.333 --> 00:01:19.366
Caomin Wang Dahai was originally a Qing soldier under the command of the King of Zhenbei

27
00:01:19.533 --> 00:01:21.066
See your majesty
