1
00:00:06.966 --> 00:00:08.266
It's called cement.

2
00:00:08.266 --> 00:00:09.600
It solidifies.

3
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:10.800
Canals can be built

4
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.500
River diversion relieves silting

5
00:00:12.566 --> 00:00:15.033
With stone bricks, you can build giant dikes

6
00:00:15.133 --> 00:00:17.200
There will be no more water from now on

7
00:00:19.533 --> 00:00:22.400
The Southeast Province can be guaranteed to be worry-free for a hundred years

8
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.900
You invented cement.

9
00:00:25.166 --> 00:00:28.400
I am a modern person who configures cement, not vegetable mud.

10
00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:33.333
Cement I never heard of it in the Qing Dynasty

11
00:00:33.333 --> 00:00:37.300
Why do I think this thing can control floods?

12
00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.000
Of course not by this alone

13
00:00:39.366 --> 00:00:41.566
Southeast Water Huan must be ready for work

14
00:00:42.133 --> 00:00:44.300
Persuading Lumen to participate in canal construction

15
00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.166
Plus the effect of this cement

16
00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.466
I promise not to speak Cantonese.

17
00:00:49.666 --> 00:00:51.200
Southeast Sui Huan Ke Please

18
00:00:52.466 --> 00:00:56.000
Fathers and ministers believe that the flood is no child's play

19
00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.666
Never trust Qin Feiyang's nonsense

20
00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:59.500
Xiaolang

21
00:01:00.266 --> 00:01:02.633
You lead the army to prevent disasters

22
00:01:03.133 --> 00:01:04.100
A little careless

23
00:01:04.166 --> 00:01:07.066
It will provoke public illness and retire
