1
00:00:01.166 --> 00:00:04.233
That's not an addiction.

2
00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:06.266
The last slow-killing poison?

3
00:00:06.566 --> 00:00:09.000
It has only been medically proven in modern times

4
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.466
Lion, say something

5
00:00:12.466 --> 00:00:14.366
This is burning eyebrows

6
00:00:14.366 --> 00:00:15.666
I want to attack Destroy Saint

7
00:00:15.866 --> 00:00:17.800
What Su Hei gave His Majesty was not salty medicine

8
00:00:17.933 --> 00:00:18.866
It was poison.

9
00:00:18.866 --> 00:00:20.500
What poison?

10
00:00:21.733 --> 00:00:24.633
Lion, you have to tread carefully.

11
00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:42.066
His Majesty's 53 micro-ministers have also served several times

12
00:00:42.066 --> 00:00:44.066
Not only nourish blood and strengthen body

13
00:00:44.066 --> 00:00:46.400
And I was so happy.

14
00:00:46.566 --> 00:00:49.266
But a rare medicine

15
00:00:49.266 --> 00:00:49.566
Yes!

16
00:00:49.566 --> 00:00:52.000
Your Majesty, as long as you take it every time, you can prolong your life

17
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:52.800
Cantonese

18
00:00:53.333 --> 00:00:55.966
If you take it for a long time, you will live forever.

19
00:00:56.666 --> 00:00:58.300
Your Zhou father and son are a little lazy

20
00:00:58.566 --> 00:01:01.500
I don't know if I can inform the palace of the formula of this medicine

21
00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:02.300
imperial doctor

22
00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:06.566
Your Majesty

23
00:01:06.566 --> 00:01:09.133
Zhenbei Prince Qin Feiyang asks to see

24
00:01:09.133 --> 00:01:12.100
It is said that there is a matter of urgency to report to His Majesty

25
00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.400
It concerns the well-being of His Majesty's dragon body

26
00:01:15.533 --> 00:01:16.800
Qin Feiyang

27
00:01:17.566 --> 00:01:20.400
Tell him to wait for me at Yuhua Pavilion
