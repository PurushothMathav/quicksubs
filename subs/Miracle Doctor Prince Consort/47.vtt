1
00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.200
Go in you

2
00:00:03.933 --> 00:00:07.033
You will be fined to sleep in the tea room for five days from today

3
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.100
Reflect on what you have done today

4
00:00:10.366 --> 00:00:12.800
First let dare to blatantly enter the land of fireworks

5
00:00:12.866 --> 00:00:15.033
It's the royal face that has been lost by you

6
00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:18.000
Princess

7
00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:25.600
I'm also a concubine

8
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.200
Let me interview five days at any time

9
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:28.800
Aren't you heartache?

10
00:00:29.766 --> 00:00:32.400
What is that old saying called?

11
00:00:33.466 --> 00:00:35.100
One pill stone and one scoop of drink

12
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.266
Comfortable in a shabby house

13
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.866
Don't worry about the concubine

14
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.466
This is to give you a chance to be a saint

15
00:00:42.466 --> 00:00:44.000
You gloat?

16
00:00:44.166 --> 00:00:45.966
You saw what happened

17
00:00:45.966 --> 00:00:47.566
I'm really going to investigate the case

18
00:00:47.733 --> 00:00:49.066
Okay, okay.

19
00:00:49.066 --> 00:00:51.966
I'm leaving when I'm looking for flowers and willows

20
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.966
Are we looking for a plausible reason?

21
00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:58.866
Hey, Consort

22
00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.200
The princess can explain

23
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.800
You must not leave the woodshed for half a step these five days

24
00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:04.766
This holiday

25
00:01:04.766 --> 00:01:06.833
Leave me to deliver food to the concubine

26
00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.200
Ah, do you really have to be so cruel?

27
00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:14.500
Love sage

28
00:01:14.566 --> 00:01:15.700
Farewell

29
00:01:25.933 --> 00:01:27.200
Pay my grandfather something big happened

30
00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:28.433
Come with me!

31
00:01:30.166 --> 00:01:31.300
What do I spend myself
