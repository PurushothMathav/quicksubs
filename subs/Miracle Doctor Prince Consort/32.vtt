00:00:00.733 --> 00:00:01.633
Sixth Prince

2
00:00:01.766 --> 00:00:04.000
You just deliberately brought the topic to the fundraiser

3
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.766
And keep winking at me

4
00:00:05.766 --> 00:00:07.700
I guess it means something else

5
00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:09.900
It seems that you are smarter than I thought

6
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:10.766
Fundraising

7
00:00:10.766 --> 00:00:13.133
It has always been the Zhou family and the Qian family working together

8
00:00:13.133 --> 00:00:14.900
I suspect they are doomed

9
00:00:14.933 --> 00:00:16.400
Just suffering from no evidence

10
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.066
So I want to use you to find out their bottom line

11
00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.466
It is rare for the Sixth Prince to have this thought

12
00:00:23.466 --> 00:00:25.400
Then let's work together

13
00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.066
Just wanted to raise 1 million two

14
00:00:29.166 --> 00:00:30.366
Is it difficult?

15
00:00:30.366 --> 00:00:32.400
Don't worry, it's on me.

16
00:00:32.766 --> 00:00:34.566
Then there's Lao Fu Ma Ye

17
00:00:40.133 --> 00:00:43.200
How to quickly see 1 million

18
00:00:44.533 --> 00:00:46.266
The world has too much production technology

19
00:00:46.766 --> 00:00:49.433
There are probably a few common cloth skin colors.

20
00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.100
If I could send the dye to the customer

21
00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.666
What 1 million?

22
00:00:57.866 --> 00:00:58.700
Qin Weiyang

23
00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.566
I think you went to the palace and scared your brain out

24
00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:04.066
Do you know what 1 million is?

25
00:01:04.166 --> 00:01:05.566
How dare you say

26
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.733
Don't worry, Messi.

27
00:01:07.733 --> 00:01:09.066
I have figured out a way

28
00:01:09.266 --> 00:01:11.333
I need the servants in the mansion to find some plants

29
00:01:11.333 --> 00:01:13.200
I want to extract plant pigments

30
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.500
What are plant pigments?

31
00:01:17.533 --> 00:01:19.600
Don't worry, you'll know soon.
