00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:01.233
investigation

2
00:00:02.066 --> 00:00:03.300
What is this place?

3
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:04.100
Please find

4
00:00:04.566 --> 00:00:06.400
I thought I had read it wrong.

5
00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.933
I thought this was the boss of the criminal trial

6
00:00:08.933 --> 00:00:09.833
Consort

7
00:00:10.466 --> 00:00:11.633
Come here to investigate

8
00:00:11.966 --> 00:00:14.266
You also have to find a reasonable explanation.

9
00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:16.333
Okay, you Qin Feiyang

10
00:00:16.333 --> 00:00:17.833
You are wild enough

11
00:00:17.933 --> 00:00:20.766
I asked you and Brother Six to seize the family's business

12
00:00:20.766 --> 00:00:22.100
How much effort is this?

13
00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:24.966
Just run to this Red Dust Pavilion and do it in a cycle?

14
00:00:25.566 --> 00:00:28.433
Sister, he said he was here to investigate the case

15
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.866
Do you believe it? I don't

16
00:00:31.933 --> 00:00:33.000
Thank you, girl.

17
00:00:34.733 --> 00:00:36.433
Why don't you explain it to the princess?

18
00:00:41.133 --> 00:00:42.200
Her Royal Highness

19
00:00:42.333 --> 00:00:44.800
Qin Gongzi, he is really here to investigate the case

20
00:00:45.133 --> 00:00:47.300
I was scared by the villain just now

21
00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:48.400
Hot all over

22
00:00:48.533 --> 00:00:50.800
But Mr. Qin is a true gentleman

23
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.433
Not only did he not take advantage of the danger

24
00:00:52.566 --> 00:00:55.366
Instead, use mysterious medical skills to help me detoxify

25
00:00:56.166 --> 00:00:56.766
So

26
00:00:56.766 --> 00:00:59.500
Please don't misunderstand Mr. Qin

27
00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.400
Is that really the case?

28
00:01:01.666 --> 00:01:03.233
What Miss Liu said is true

29
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.600
No lie at all

30
00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:06.866
I'll let you go today

31
00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:08.133
The death penalty is inevitable

32
00:01:08.133 --> 00:01:09.000
Living sin

33
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.033
You come down

34
00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:18.466
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

35
00:01:20.766 --> 00:01:21.300
What are you looking at?

36
00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:22.366
Go go go go go go

37
00:01:22.733 --> 00:01:25.233
Walk over and adjourn the meeting

38
00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.066
Qin Gongzi, will we meet again?
