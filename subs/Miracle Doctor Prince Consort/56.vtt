1
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:08.066
That's a lot of power!

2
00:00:10.533 --> 00:00:11.966
Okay, okay, it's real

3
00:00:12.166 --> 00:00:14.866
This shot can definitely return to a sense of city walls

4
00:00:17.333 --> 00:00:18.400
This is popular

5
00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.466
Frontline soldiers are like gods

6
00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.800
Master Fu, how did you make this thing?

7
00:00:26.266 --> 00:00:29.000
Father, this thing can be built in large quantities

8
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.100
Drawings and production processes are also published in education

9
00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:31.900
belong

10
00:00:32.533 --> 00:00:33.400
No trend at all

11
00:00:34.533 --> 00:00:38.066
Is this still the prince I know?

12
00:00:38.566 --> 00:00:39.566
Hand without power

13
00:00:39.566 --> 00:00:40.500
Boundless entrance

14
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.266
Intensify the construction of a non-stop delivery to the front line

15
00:00:43.933 --> 00:00:45.833
How to use it, I have informed the ninth prince

16
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:47.500
The ammunition formula required for the explosion

17
00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.100
After I changed it

18
00:00:49.366 --> 00:00:51.100
You ask the household department to declare as soon as possible

19
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:52.700
Thank you lord

20
00:00:53.066 --> 00:00:54.000
Don't scare me!

21
00:00:54.666 --> 00:00:56.566
The prince has made such a great contribution

22
00:00:56.566 --> 00:00:58.233
I am greatly rewarded

23
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.233
His Royal Highness the Third Prince

24
00:01:03.333 --> 00:01:04.366
Take this as an example

25
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.166
It can turn the tide of the northward march

26
00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.900
sir

27
00:01:18.766 --> 00:01:20.066
Why are you here?

28
00:01:20.166 --> 00:01:21.666
When are you so panicked?

29
00:01:22.133 --> 00:01:24.033
Did I give up and create problems?
