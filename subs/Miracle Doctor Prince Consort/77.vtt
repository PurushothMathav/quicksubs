1
00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:02.200
ironclad evidence

2
00:00:06.166 --> 00:00:07.033
Really?

3
00:00:09.733 --> 00:00:12.966
When you framed my father, old man

4
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.466
Have you ever imagined that today

5
00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:20.400
This is the last book you ever wrote to my father

6
00:00:20.966 --> 00:00:22.033
The content of the letter

7
00:00:22.266 --> 00:00:24.100
I think you know better than me

8
00:00:30.166 --> 00:00:31.400
Your Majesty please take a look

9
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.366
When the mother finally remembers the truth

10
00:00:33.566 --> 00:00:34.666
You can tell at a glance

11
00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:36.800
Ok you act

12
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.533
Zhenmei Wang's work is great

13
00:00:38.533 --> 00:00:39.766
Made countless achievements

14
00:00:39.766 --> 00:00:41.700
How dare you imitate the imperial decree to slander him

15
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.033
I don't have it.

16
00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.366
Please check it out, Your Majesty

17
00:00:52.366 --> 00:00:55.533
No matter and you only have one letter

18
00:00:55.533 --> 00:00:56.533
Not enough to identify you

19
00:00:56.533 --> 00:00:57.366
line large characters

20
00:00:57.933 --> 00:00:59.900
I hope the father will find out

21
00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:02.400
Please come up.

22
00:01:14.966 --> 00:01:17.800
Where did you find this letter?

23
00:01:18.866 --> 00:01:20.633
It was a case five years ago

24
00:01:20.766 --> 00:01:22.633
It has always been my heart disease

25
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.800
I will send someone to find out the authenticity of this letter

26
00:01:28.366 --> 00:01:29.200
maybe

27
00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.766
This letter was forged by the prince

28
00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.466
Did you deliberately plant the frame sheet?
