00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:02.700
This prince has long known that the princess loves music theory deeply

2
00:00:03.066 --> 00:00:04.866
How can an ordinary musical instrument be worthy of a princess?

3
00:00:04.866 --> 00:00:06.366
An otherworldly temperament

4
00:00:06.466 --> 00:00:07.700
One thought to death

5
00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:10.166
This prince invented a brand new musical instrument

6
00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:12.100
Compose music live

7
00:00:12.566 --> 00:00:13.900
Princess Xie Yulin

8
00:00:15.333 --> 00:00:19.033
What does the princess want to do with her stubbornness?

9
00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:21.966
Invent new instruments and compose their own music

10
00:00:22.566 --> 00:00:25.266
This Qin Feiyang hid deep enough

11
00:00:25.266 --> 00:00:27.300
Hahaha he

12
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.600
Does he really understand music theory?

13
00:00:34.966 --> 00:00:37.033
What the hell is this musical instrument?

14
00:00:58.333 --> 00:01:01.100
Is this still the stubborn stone?

15
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:05.766
It's a rare pleasure wizard seen in a century

16
00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:10.700
The prince's lyrics have a trace of love

17
00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.200
This is a gift made in heaven

18
00:01:12.366 --> 00:01:14.533
Who just said he doesn't know how to please?

19
00:01:14.533 --> 00:01:17.800
The sound of this instrument is always harmonious

20
00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.100
Crisp and elegant

21
00:01:19.266 --> 00:01:21.100
So charming

22
00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.233
Wonderful Wonderful

23
00:01:25.266 --> 00:01:28.266
Even the big men of this emperor were fascinated

24
00:01:28.266 --> 00:01:30.266
Hahahaha

25
00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.900
Dare to ask the prince if he can give this rose as a gift

26
00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.066
This song can have sheet music
