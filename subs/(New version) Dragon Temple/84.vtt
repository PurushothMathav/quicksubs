00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.180
Dad, we have a crazy relationship with each other now.

2
00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:06.480
Relationships are scary, what do you want to see?

3
00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:08.570
Afraid of melting into an electronic head,

4
00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.380
Handsome, if we all have something to do with two years.

5
00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:14.880
That's actually, don't become a liar.

6
00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:16.960
Hahahahahaha.

7
00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:19.060
The ambassador said yes, it is all,

8
00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:21.880
Our two families should go take pictures.

9
00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:29.850
I like the photo, and I'm married.

10
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.180
Oh, you got married,

11
00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.840
The person you give it to will only give it to you on the wedding day,

12
00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.260
If you keep taking advantage of us, you will be killed.

13
00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:40.460
Now you are the house owner

14
00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:42.680
you your total brain and car

15
00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:44.550
Give it back to me

16
00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.420
You Chen and Wang family

17
00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:52.740
Opportunity Party

18
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.580
So thin

19
00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:57.950
What is that?

20
00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.080
You also asked me to go to the labor training session for adults.

21
00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:03.470
I hate you, but you also know what our industry is like.

22
00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.960
This is a good opportunity to sign in the South.

23
00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.290
This is our business anyway.

24
00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.480
It has always been a first-class price

25
00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:15.430
Are we not sure yet?

26
00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:17.190
Isn't this signed?

27
00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:18.440
You actually

28
00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:20.590
I know this about you and me

29
00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:23.070
But I hope you can understand

30
00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.130
You and excellence

31
00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.160
And I will definitely find one

32
00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:31.940
Otherwise, sign

33
00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.600
You asked me to go and consult with you first

34
00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.560
if they choose

35
00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:38.750
Just keep calling me again

36
00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:40.820
But if he chooses

37
00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:45.010
Do you understand
