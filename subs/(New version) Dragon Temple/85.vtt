00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.030
No, what's wrong or not?

2
00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:04.650
Stop speaking so harshly.

3
00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:08.630
You can answer it easily!

4
00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:12.180
What?

5
00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:16.680
If we do this, won’t it be a bit unfair?

6
00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:19.670
Don't think too much.

7
00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:22.580
If you play like a human being, you will be reborn.

8
00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:28.080
We have a family, so we don’t need to compare ourselves with others.

9
00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:34.000
Can you think of yourself as you?

10
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
If it were you, Ye Lie,

11
00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:42.320
Otherwise, I will wait for you,

12
00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:45.500
You will also bring a sense of harmony, your identity to you.

13
00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:51.060
In this case, then prepare well,

14
00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.130
You go together to help you one day.

15
00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.970
Let me see, it’s really, really, really, really true
