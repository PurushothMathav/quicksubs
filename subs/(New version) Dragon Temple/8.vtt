Mr. Du, what's the matter with you?

Ask about you. Ask about you. Yang Gui

15
00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:47.400
Sir, let go of you little old man

16
00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:51.400
Is it another person who made my data wrong?

17
00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:53.020
You are more capable now

18
00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:54.160
Is it also very satisfying?

19
00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.780
I, I, I, I didn’t know it was you

20
00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.540
I don't know either

21
00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:59.400
You don’t have the guts to enter 10,000

22
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.300
I don’t dare anymore

23
00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:02.240
What on earth is going on?

24
00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:05.840
Why don't you know this guy well enough?

25
00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:07.840
Where did you make a mistake when ordering?

26
00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.040
He's just an old reformer who just came out of his shell.

27
00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:11.360
How could it be allowed

28
00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.320
Big shots like middle-aged and old people are so expensive.

29
00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:15.220
I'll be careful anyway

30
00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.880
It must be fake at the scene

31
00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:19.990
Why did you suddenly return to Jiangbei?

32
00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:22.720
Someone wants to miss the rain together

33
00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:24.600
Xiaodu killed Hai Leng’s parents

34
00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:26.450
I'm coming back this time

35
00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:28.090
Just come and go for their citizens
