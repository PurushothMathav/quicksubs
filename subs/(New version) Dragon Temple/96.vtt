00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.560
Sister Ye Xiang, I found that after watching it for a day,

2
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:07.800
White City Flower, Mingyue,

3
00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:10.240
Her sails will be subject to stronger winds in Jiangbei,

4
00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:12.620
At that time, Ye Xiang and Miss Ye,

5
00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:14.540
How about a grand wedding.

6
00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:17.030
The wedding will continue tomorrow,

7
00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:18.890
Do you want to find a new number?

8
00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:20.730
You don’t know Ye Xiangli either,

9
00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:26.190
Actually it’s not Ye Xiangli,

10
00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:26.810
What?

11
00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:31.190
why can't i

12
00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.510
Becoming the Dragon God’s Lady in the night

13
00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.520
What does the weather have to do with it?

14
00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:38.680
The relationship between Ye Qi and Yi Yi Se is loveless.

15
00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:40.000
Lord Dragon God

16
00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:41.650
A toneless day

17
00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:43.680
Stopped thinking about the night

18
00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:45.520
No Lord Dragon God

19
00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.780
Still dare to cut grass?

20
00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:54.840
After the two of them are done

21
00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.220
We each brought it

22
00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:03.760
My own palmistry made a mistake in fixing the day. The weather is beautiful and the sun is yours.

23
00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:06.700
what do I do

24
00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:08.060
please let me go with him

25
00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:09.660
I'm going to marry Lou Sheng tomorrow.

26
00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:13.650
Are you really what they say you are?

27
00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.050
Kill him and Mr. Lou Sheng

28
00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:16.170
Don't hesitate to send me out

29
00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.310
How is it possible?

30
00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.770
You are my gifted building

31
00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:20.490
How could I be a bowl given to others?

32
00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:23.820
Then you let me go, right?

33
00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.380
You make yourself the newest giraffe in the world

34
00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:27.020
Be careful when buying yourself

35
00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:30.280
I'm going to see you tomorrow, don't worry
