Who are you? How could you do this?

12
00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:34.840
What do you mean by this?

13
00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:37.960
Since when have I been afraid of paying a powerful son-in-law?

14
00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:39.540
Don't you really know

15
00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.100
Not as good as here today

16
00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:44.060
There is still a beauty pageant left.

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:46.900

This voter contest

21
00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:56.600
It's to choose a wife for Mr. Zhengsheng, right?

22
00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:01.700
This is my son-in-law, you have the same fate as you

23
00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:03.220
It seems that your government

24
00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:05.459
Not a good thing either

25
00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:06.600
He did too much

26
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.380
It's for his own good that he can lead people with him

27
00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:09.900
What do you believe except

28
00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.260
Take people like them through with a bowl of meat

29
00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:19.680
But what relationship do you want?
