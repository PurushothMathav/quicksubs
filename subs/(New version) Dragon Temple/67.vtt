00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:04.680
When your worker is called, you go in directly.

3
00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:07.040
Do as I give you,

4
00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.330
Don't be nervous,

5
00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:12.730

have you heard

10
00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:25.530
Why did the company change its chairman?

11
00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:28.180
What does this person have to do with us?

12
00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:29.950
relationship and big

13
00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:32.030
I just got the notice

14
00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:33.950
Chairman Yang Lun has worked in the company

15
00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:35.780
Itâ€™s time to call the outside shop face again

16
00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:39.040
What is the name of the chairman?

17
00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:39.600
What is the name of the chairman?

18
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:40.740
What's going on when the chairman comes to visit?

19
00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:42.620
Say we have a good chance of performing

20
00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:43.860
How do you get it clean?

21
00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:46.130
What the hell am I thinking?

22
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:48.420
Then meet around

23
00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:49.300
Just let the chairman

24
00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:50.480
our previous relationship

25
00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:51.720
I'm dead

26
00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:02.540
This is our face
