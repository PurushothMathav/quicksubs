00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:06.680
It is obvious that those who sell the flag ring group are the most leisurely.

2
00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:14.290
We agree to ask you to please explain.

3
00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:18.080
Why is it that the winner this time is not from our flag ring group?

4
00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:20.840
What’s the explanation? It’s really the result of our thorough discussions in Heisei.

5
00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:28.310
Your statement asked for a direction of impression.

6
00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:29.900
Must.

7
00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:32.350
I think this is the right direction.

8
00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:33.250
Four words for you.

9
00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:35.760
dad. Don't worry.

10
00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:37.560
This time it's not like I'm sure.

11
00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:38.900
Prove your abilities.

12
00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:41.210
It's really not me.

13
00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:42.150
The word "call for sale".

14
00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:46.880
The word "call for sale".

15
00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.020
The word "call for sale".

16
00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.760
The word "call for sale".

17
00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:53.210
Forward this project to me.

18
00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:55.830
The emperor does not want us

19
00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:58.180
do it reluctantly

20
00:00:58.870 --> 00:00:59.570
why here

21
00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.060
Do you know who you are talking to?

22
00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.920
Your Lanxia chess group

23
00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.660
Want to survive in Jiangbei?

24
00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:07.800
must be in the same industry

25
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.740
Zi'er looks unnatural

26
00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:12.620
Who will you write about later? Miss Zhong

27
00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:13.980
I'm seriously confused now

28
00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.980
you and tender response cat cat you

29
00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:17.840
If you don’t want to be honest in English

30
00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.730
Stop checking the phone

31
00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:24.330
Give me your most reliable self

32
00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:27.340
I can't think of it. It's heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy.
