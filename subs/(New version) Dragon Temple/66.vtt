00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:02.830
Hahahaha, dear

2
00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:05.270
I'll go and say what you said earlier

3
00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:06.850
Look what time it is here

4
00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:09.790
Then let’s talk about it after everyone interrupts?

5
00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:11.330
I was the one who interviewed me

6
00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:15.680
What's wrong with waiting? What about now?

7
00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:17.300
What's going on?

8
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:18.360
He is my classmate Gao Chong

9
00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:19.500
If I

10
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:20.860
He just came up from the boss

11
00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:22.140
want to find a job

12
00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:25.320
Do you think there are any new jobs in his company?

13
00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:28.380
Make some arrangements for him

14
00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.660
Since he is the chairman

15
00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:34.380
Then I see you taking a photo with him as doing that.

16
00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:37.610
The company just made a mistake

17
00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:41.130
Hahahaha, don’t come here

18
00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.740
This is for me individually

19
00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:46.860
Because you have to work with another layerware

20
00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.750
It's high-end

21
00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:50.380
I'll go up here

22
00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:51.860
Go out and give someone a drink

23
00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:54.940
Is there anyone who has died?

24
00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.100
Now if there is no engine

25
00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.460
Then forget it

26
00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:00.710
It was me who sent it

27
00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:02.210
I don't hesitate to use him

28
00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:19.640
Hahahaha let's go. Come and see you later.
