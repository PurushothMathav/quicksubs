00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:03.650
Isn’t Blue Shrimp Group a small company that has just risen?

2
00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:05.570
How come she has the same feelings as me?

3
00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:09.040
Help me with the wrong facts

4
00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:12.280
I want you to go to dinner

5
00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:14.130
Anyway, it's obvious to you

6
00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:15.210
But I would like a few

7
00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.060
Let me take action

8
00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:19.990
blue shrimp group

9
00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:22.610
How long will it take for you to complete this project?

10
00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:29.570
It will take us about six months to fly

11
00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.690
Dear police, the results will be released later.

12
00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:37.330
We begged a family for six months

13
00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:40.310
The three-month period within which the Blue Shrimp Group can issue the offer

14
00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:42.110
This joke group is so irresponsible

15
00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.980
Is there something wrong with everyone in this group?

16
00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:48.580
This woman is looking for trouble with me

17
00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:53.940
Yes, the most tuan is a matter that is not as good as one’s heart.

18
00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:54.940
good good

19
00:00:58.380 --> 00:00:59.560
You threw me into my face

20
00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:00.840
Are you satisfied now?

21
00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:01.780
Go go go go go

22
00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:03.020
I shouldn't have brought you here

23
00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:04.180
What's the score?

24
00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:05.170
He probably took me with him

25
00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:06.130
You have to thank me

26
00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.200
What did you show most this time?

27
00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:14.500
Come on, three or four points or something?

28
00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:16.660
How is it possible
