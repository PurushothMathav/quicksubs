Don't worry, they're gone.

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:04.100
Mr. Du, could you send

3
00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:04.940
me home?

4
00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:07.140
Yes, I'll take care of it.

5
00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:11.020
I've just contacted the Thai Embassy.

(no change needed)

7
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.000

12
00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:22.080
You're welcome. Protecting Chinese citizens overseas

13
00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.360
is

14
00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:24.120
our responsibility.

15
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:26.500
It's all set.

16
00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:27.880
Check in now.

17
00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:29.980
Safe travels.

18
00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:32.080
Thank you.

19
00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:38.480
Dad, I'm at the gate.

20
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:39.620
Barring delays,

21
00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.060
I'll be in Bangkok in

22
00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.920
about eleven hours.
