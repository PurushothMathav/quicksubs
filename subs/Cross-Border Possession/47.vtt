00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.260
Did I order this? This...

2
00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:04.260
Why does every dress look like it's

3
00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:05.900
made of barely any fabric?

4
00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:07.460
Who would wear these kinds of clothes?

5
00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.420
Why? Why are there even dresses

6
00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:10.300
that are lingerie?

7
00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:12.060
I'm doomed, I'm doomed.

8
00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.840
My name is Linda,

9
00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:14.260
He's not going to make me wear

10
00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:15.360
these clothes, is he?

11
00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:16.900
This ridiculous leather,

12
00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:18.520
I don't want it, I don't want it!

13
00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:21.460
Thank you,

14
00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.100
Linda. You can go now.

15
00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:24.160
Okay.

16
00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:30.700
I need to find somewhere to hide.

17
00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:36.300
The closet.

18
00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:37.560
It's locked.

19
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.740
It's too low to crawl under the bed.

20
00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.420
Oh my god, what should I do?

21
00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:48.240
What to do? What to do? Is it over?
