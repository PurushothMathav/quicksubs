00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.060
No touching, no...

2
00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:02.160
...or anything else.

3
00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:03.340
Ji Lingli, you tell me.

4
00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:04.560
This...what are you to me?

5
00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:05.280
What am I to you?

6
00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:06.860
I don't want to be your woman.

7
00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:08.620
Let me go, okay?

8
00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:09.400
Ji Lingli,

9
00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:11.460
you haven't seen me angry yet.

10
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:13.780
You're challenging my limits.

11
00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:15.620
I haven't seen her use so much

12
00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:16.760
violence and terror before.

13
00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:18.020
Does that not count as

14
00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:18.900
anger to her?

15
00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:20.200
Then how terrifying is her

16
00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:21.620
true anger?

17
00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:23.740
Are you afraid of my anger, of me getting mad?

18
00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:25.920
If you are, come and ask me.

19
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:26.700
I won't be angry.

20
00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:40.810
I really want to hold her down in the bathtub.

21
00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:44.310
violently remove her clothes.

22
00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.530
I'll get someone to give you a bath.

23
00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.810
I'm afraid she saw the girl was still alive.

24
00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:04.420
Can I have my

25
00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:05.420
phone back?

26
00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.260
I found it in the room just now,

27
00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:08.560
it must have been hidden by her.

28
00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:10.640
What do you want your phone for?
