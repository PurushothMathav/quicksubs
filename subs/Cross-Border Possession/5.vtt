00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:13.460
Sir, I’m here to deliver your drinks.

2
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:14.680
So timid,

3
00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.180
yet you dare to serve drinks in a nightclub?

4
00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:22.020
Pour the drinks!

5
00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:24.240
Alright.

6
00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:27.120
If my boss isn’t

7
00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:28.200
satisfied with the price,

8
00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:30.460
no worries, we can negotiate.

9
00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.040
You, go pour drinks for that gentleman.

10
00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:46.200
Yes, sir.

11
00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:54.280
Look up.

12
00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:17.230
S-Sorry, sorry,

13
00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:18.090
such bad luck,

14
00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:19.370
running into this terrifying

15
00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:20.670
man here.

16
00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:22.250
Calm down, calm down,

17
00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:23.570
it was dark last night,

18
00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:24.690
he probably didn’t see me clearly,

19
00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.070
and today I’ve got

20
00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.010
such heavy makeup on,

21
00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:29.310
he probably doesn’t recognize me, right?

22
00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.630
Sneaky, hiding so low.

23
00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:33.650
Why are you so nervous?

24
00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:35.030
Can’t even pour a drink properly,

25
00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:36.570
get out of here!

26
00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:38.810
Wait.

27
00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:44.230
Mr. Shi Nai,

28
00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:45.610
didn’t you just say you’d

29
00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:47.830
send me a girlfriend?

30
00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:49.130
Her.
