00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:02.840
For my previous offense against you, Mr. Huo,

2
00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:04.160
I hope you can overlook

3
00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:04.900
my mistake.

4
00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:06.760
Who told you to call me Mr. Huo?

5
00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:08.560
Then what should I call you?

6
00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:11.040
You can call me by my name directly.

7
00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:12.940
Do you know about Wu Tai’s

8
00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:14.000
situation?

9
00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:14.580
Mm.

10
00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:15.880
How did you know?

11
00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:16.840
In Rome,

12
00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.140
there’s nothing I don’t know.

13
00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:20.540
I just heard

14
00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.660
the leader of DS International arranged to meet you.

15
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:23.420
So?

16
00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:25.300
When you meet with him,

17
00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:27.540
could you talk to them

18
00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:29.060
and ask them to release Wu Tai?

19
00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:32.020
Why should I help you save him?

20
00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:39.830
Let me phrasing it differently.

21
00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:41.350
If I help him,

22
00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:44.110
what’s in it for me?

23
00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:47.890
I can break up with him?

24
00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:50.330
Didn’t you want me to break up with him?

25
00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:51.290
Ji Lingling,

26
00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:52.830
you don’t think I’d go through

27
00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:53.950
all this trouble

28
00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:55.630
just to make you break up with him, do you?

29
00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.130
Then what do you want?

30
00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:02.170
I thought you’d figured it out.

31
00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:06.210
Did you team up with DS International’s

32
00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.090
people to kidnap Wu Tai?
