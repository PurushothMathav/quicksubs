00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.920
Hou Jue Ling didn't follow me,

2
00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:04.060
Does this mean I can finally leave?

3
00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:05.500
So I'm finally free to go?

4
00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:08.680
How did you lose her?

5
00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:10.020
I waited for him at every restroom in the city,

6
00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:11.180
but he vanished right under my nose.

7
00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:12.580
Who knew he disappeared

8
00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:13.960
right under my nose.

9
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.320
It seems your brother met

10
00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:17.920
his match this time.

11
00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.680
Sir, sir, sir.

12
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.020
Sir, Miss D has boarded the flight

13
00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:27.900
to Bangkok,

14
00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:29.580
and it took off ten minutes ago.

15
00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.060
Also, Miss D messaged

16
00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:33.940
her father twenty minutes ago.

17
00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:35.600
Her father will meet her

18
00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.580
at the Bangkok airport.

19
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.120
Sir, I found something

20
00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:42.060
else.

21
00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:42.680
Yes?

22
00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:44.880
When Miss D was at the restaurant,

23
00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:46.480
a girl gave her

24
00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:47.440
something.

25
00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:49.920
I checked every restaurant in the city,

26
00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.140
but no one contacted her.

27
00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.420
What did the girl give her?

28
00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:55.840
That girl bought a bottle of water

29
00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:57.300
at a nearby pharmacy,

30
00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:58.640
and a box of birth control pills.

31
00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.880
Did she take them?
