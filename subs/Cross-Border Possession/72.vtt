00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.180
Don't like me? Then tell me,

2
00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:09.040
who do you like? Still like

3
00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:09.860
that only

4
00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:11.560
that dying boyfriend?

5
00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:15.000
No, I don't like him anymore.

6
00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:22.100
Today, you have to like me soon.

7
00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:23.340
He emphasized that I'm by his side,

8
00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:24.300
I have to marry him,

9
00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:25.340
and he even forces me

10
00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:26.600
to like him. This is just too absurd.

11
00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.220
This is just too absurd.

12
00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:48.340
Surveillance cameras are everywhere outside,

13
00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:49.720
where is the passport hidden?

14
00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.340
Ms. Qi, I'm Linda.

15
00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:05.440
Linda, how is it going?

16
00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:06.340
Did you find Mrs. Wu?

17
00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:07.020
Ms. Qi,

18
00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.500
I've already found her for you.

19
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.360
She's at Shengqiao Cotton Hospital now.

20
00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:11.480
How is she doing now?

21
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.680
I was at her ward door today,

22
00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.240
and heard her attending physician say,

23
00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.480
she probably won't make it through the week.

24
00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:20.180
Probably won't make it through the week?
