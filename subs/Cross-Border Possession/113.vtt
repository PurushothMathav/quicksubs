00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:04.540
Three months of turmoil, it's a calculated plot.

2
00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:08.600
What evidence do you have

3
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:09.640
that proves it was me?

4
00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:12.140
In all of Italy,

5
00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:13.860
who dares send a message to

6
00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.080
city hall?

7
00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:17.800
Your friend,

8
00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:19.660
Catherine, right?

9
00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:21.720
Where is she?

10
00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:24.800
What?

11
00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:27.880
Didn't you say she was pregnant?

12
00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:29.200
I'll have a DNA test done on the baby.

13
00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:30.440
I'll obtain a sample.

14
00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:31.500
Then we'll have a DNA test.

15
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:32.440
It'll be conclusive.

16
00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:34.640
I want to see if this child

17
00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:35.880
is mine.

18
00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:45.740
Let's not make a scene anymore.

19
00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.220
Our marriage,

20
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:48.600
will never end.

21
00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:51.980
What are you going to do?

22
00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.020
Take a bath.

23
00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:02.920
Mr. Mu, youâ€¦

24
00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:03.940
What are you doing?

25
00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:05.030
Please help me.

26
00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.280
You sent that email,

27
00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.280
would you help me bathe?

28
00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:14.550
Help me undress.

29
00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.260
Keep undressing.

30
00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.570
Please help me.

31
00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:42.190
Continue undressing.
