1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.440
Lingling, say something.

2
00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:03.520
I have something urgent, I'll hang up first.

3
00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:14.590
Lingling, I've told you before,

4
00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:16.670
pay attention while we're kissing,

5
00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:18.130
don't be distracted.

6
00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.470
Sir, the matter you asked me to handle last time,

7
00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:26.670
the marriage arrangements are completed.

8
00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:26.990
Good.

9
00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:28.270
According to regulations,

10
00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:29.450
your marriage to Miss Ji

11
00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:31.230
registration will be publicly announced at City Hall for two weeks,

12
00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:32.490
to ensure that no one objects

13
00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:33.150
to this marriage.

14
00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:34.690
But the public notice period is actually

15
00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:35.630
just a formality.

16
00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.370
Let City Hall withdraw the public notice.

17
00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:38.190
Okay, sir.

18
00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:41.030
Lingling, from today onwards,

19
00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:42.890
you have a new identity.

20
00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:43.850
What do you mean?

21
00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:50.090
Mrs. Huo.

22
00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:51.410
Mrs. Huo?

23
00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:53.290
From today onwards,

24
00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:55.290
the two of us are legally married in the

25
00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:56.570
Italian Republic.

26
00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:58.570
Legally married? Did he

27
00:00:58.570 --> 00:00:59.670
already complete the procedures?

28
00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:00.930
Is Huo Jiu Ling really so

29
00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:01.770
omnipotent?

30
00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.070
He didn't even need my

31
00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:04.070
consent or approval to get married,

32
00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:05.210
what am I going to do?
