00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:06.160
Leilei, I lost my phone.

2
00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:07.240
Don’t call me.

3
00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:08.940
If there’s any news from the lawyer,

4
00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:10.200
come find me at the foot

5
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.700
of Zhiling Mountain.

6
00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.840
Please have a seat. May I ask,

7
00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.280
what issues would you like to consult about?

8
00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:21.120
Lawyer Reid,

9
00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:22.680
my friend just killed

10
00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.460
someone. Here’s what happened,

11
00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:26.480
a group of thugs robbed him,

12
00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:28.960
and after they left, he chased them to get his money back.

13
00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:30.220
Lawyer Reid,

14
00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:31.620
your client has arrived early.

15
00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:32.660
Alright.

16
00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:36.160
Uh, sorry, Lawyer,

17
00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:37.520
about the issue you mentioned,

18
00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:38.360
I’ve got a general

19
00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:39.800
understanding of the situation.

20
00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.500
How about you leave your contact info,

21
00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.540
and I’ll reach out after I’m done,

22
00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:44.020
sound good?

23
00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.700
Sure.

24
00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:50.660
Last night, Li Qi’s sister’s

25
00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:51.980
boyfriend was beaten to death

26
00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:53.600
with a baseball bat. Li Qi,

27
00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:54.500
to avenge his sister,

28
00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.000
is looking everywhere for the killer.

29
00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.900
Such a small matter, and you’re reporting it to me?

30
00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:00.960
Hey, this isn’t a small

31
00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.200
matter. Trust me,

32
00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:03.900
you’ll understand once you see this.

33
00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:08.140
Isn’t that the little one’s

34
00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:09.090
boyfriend?

35
00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.040
This morning, a Miss Ji Lingling

36
00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:13.140
came to my law firm

37
00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.700
to consult. Her consultation

38
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.520
was pretty much about this.

39
00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.940
Originally, I hadn’t figured out how to deal

40
00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:20.600
with that damned troublemaker…
