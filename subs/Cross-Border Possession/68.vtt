00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.900
I want to see if anyone is looking for me.

2
00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:04.140
Really? You want to call the police?

3
00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:06.720
No… no. I just

4
00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:07.480
afraid my family

5
00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:09.000
will worry if they can't find me.

6
00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:10.600
The Huo Jiuling case…

7
00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:11.760
Calling the police won't help.

8
00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:13.760
Let's eat first. We can talk later.

9
00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:26.860
Why aren't you drinking the soup?

10
00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.320
I don't like carrots.

11
00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:29.760
This little thing is picky.

12
00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:31.300
It's no wonder he's so talkative.

13
00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:36.280
It shouldn't be long now.

14
00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.300
Don't you want your phone? Finish your soup,

15
00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:39.380
I'll give you your phone.

16
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:40.340
Okay.

17
00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:51.970
Can I have my phone now?

18
00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:53.550
Is it delicious?

19
00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:55.350
Yes… delicious.

20
00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:04.540
Eat.

21
00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:25.300
No, it really is delicious.

22
00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:28.000
Can I have my phone now?

23
00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.820
I've already given you what you wanted.

24
00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:41.520
What I want,

25
00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:42.860
when are you going to give it to me?
