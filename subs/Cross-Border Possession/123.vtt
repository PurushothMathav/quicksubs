00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:03.180
No! Don't kill!

2
00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:14.720
If you really have AIDS,

3
00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.020
I'll die with you.

4
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:18.060
Okay.

5
00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:26.840
Miss Ji,

6
00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:27.880
come to pick up your test

7
00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:28.600
report at noon,

8
00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:29.660
I took other patients'

9
00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:30.980
AIDS confirmation forms.

10
00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.850
Ji Lingling, you'd rather lie

11
00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.510
about having AIDS than sleep with me.

12
00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:43.370
How much do you hate me?

13
00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:46.610
I don't want to sleep with someone

14
00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:47.590
who is my grandfather.

15
00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:49.550
What do you mean?

16
00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:51.710
Don't you know?

17
00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.030
Didn't you get married to someone else

18
00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:54.330
two years ago?

19
00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:57.110
Married? I've only been married

20
00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:58.610
to you.

21
00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.650
After I was arrested two years ago,

22
00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:02.370
I was rescued by a kind fisherman

23
00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:03.910
and recuperated in town for a month.

24
00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.910
But when I was ready to go back

25
00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:05.850
to find you,

26
00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:07.290
I saw in the town newspaper

27
00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:08.570
that Cavilla International's

28
00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:09.770
head of the family and heiress

29
00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:11.010
Jin Lianyin got married.

30
00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:15.050
The month you disappeared,

31
00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:17.130
I gave you that position.

32
00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.390


33
00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.010
The person in the newspaper was him,

34
00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:22.390
and he got married.

35
00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:25.930
I thought...

36
00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:28.590
You said you'd come back to me,

37
00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:31.050
does that mean you've

38
00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:32.030
accepted me?

39
00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:36.490
At that time, you were alone to save me.

40
00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:37.730
I was thinking,

41
00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:39.710
if we could go back safely,

42
00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:41.750
I would try not to be afraid of you,

43
00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.330
try to like you.

44
00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:44.930
To hear your true feelings.
