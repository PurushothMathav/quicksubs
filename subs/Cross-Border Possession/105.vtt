00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:03.520
Someone from overseas contacted me,

2
00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:04.980
saying they urgently need a batch of weapons,

3
00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.440
the quantity is larger than in any of their previous

4
00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:08.540
transactions with us.

5
00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:09.920
It's a significantly larger order.

6
00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:12.040
How much larger?

7
00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:24.980
As long as they can pay,

8
00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:26.300
we'll sell it to them.

9
00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:30.000
Okay, I'll have my people

10
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.060
prepare it.

11
00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.940
By the way, Li You. I heard from Red that

12
00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.180
international marriage is a complicated process.

13
00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.140
You managed it in just a few days in Bangkok!

14
00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:43.100
That's incredible!

15
00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:45.760
International marriage is complicated,

16
00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:48.040
but you've handled all the international red tape.

17
00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:53.540
You're amazing. Come on,

18
00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:55.940
best wishes for your wedding.

19
00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.140
Also, be more careful next time.

20
00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.600
Don't mess with my head again.
