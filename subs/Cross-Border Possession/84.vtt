00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:04.060
I think you should stay.

2
00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:04.480
Linda,

3
00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:06.360
she saved your life. Without Linda,

4
00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:07.940
you'd probably still be starving.

5
00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:08.860
You wouldn't have eaten.

6
00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:10.420
If you're done,

7
00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:11.760
get out.

8
00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:12.920
That little sister,

9
00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:13.860
how is she now?

10
00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:15.180
Still feeling dizzy.

11
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:18.460
I figured,

12
00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:19.660
you hothead,

13
00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:20.700
breaking the rules for the first time,

14
00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:21.640
something bad would happen.

15
00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:23.540
But I never expected

16
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.780
you'd knock her out cold.

17
00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:28.220
Get out.

18
00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.580
Huh?

19
00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:33.060
Vice Commander.

20
00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:35.000
Sir, Linda's

21
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.520
lucky to be alive,

22
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:36.820
she's still breathing.

23
00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:38.160
Keep her here.

24
00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:39.400
Also, tell the young lady,

25
00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:40.880
no one in the manor

26
00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.100
is to discuss this.

27
00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.180
Especially, don't tell Ji Lingling.

28
00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:44.960
Yes.

29
00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.000
No, please, don't touch me.

30
00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.960
Ji Lingling, are you that afraid of me?

31
00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.940
Don't worry, it won't happen again.

32
00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:07.300
Don't hurt Wu Tai.

33
00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:10.340
Ji Lingling,

34
00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.200
is it only when she dies,

35
00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:14.540
that you can forget her?
