00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:01.600
Little uncle…

2
00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:04.740
It’s okay now.

3
00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:06.000
Get in the car.

4
00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:23.490
Did they bully you?

5
00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:27.270
Little uncle,

6
00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:28.670
how did you know I was here?

7
00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:30.150
Your mom called me,

8
00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:31.030
saying you left

9
00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:32.230
this morning and haven’t

10
00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:32.790
come home,

11
00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:33.690
and your phone was off.

12
00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:36.530
I had people check the

13
00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:37.590
street cameras across the city,

14
00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:39.630
and saw you in the footage.

15
00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:40.790
What happened?

16
00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.610
Little uncle, this morning

17
00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:44.410
I went to the Jade Buddha Temple with a classmate to pray,

18
00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:45.290
and afterward,

19
00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:46.770
on the way home, we were grabbed

20
00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.590
by some people. They made me go

21
00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:50.010
to a club’s private room to deliver drinks,

22
00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:51.330
saying if I did

23
00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:52.290
what they asked,

24
00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.110
they’d let me and my classmate go.

25
00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:55.070
Little uncle,

26
00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:56.310
but my classmate is still

27
00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:57.170
in their hands,

28
00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.790
what do I do?

29
00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:00.630
Linlin, don’t panic. Here’s what we’ll do,

30
00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:02.890
tell me your classmate’s name,

31
00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:04.850
and find a photo of them

32
00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:06.710
for me, I’ll have people look.

33
00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:08.610
Don’t worry,

34
00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.850
your classmate will be fine.

35
00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:16.780
Found it.

36
00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:23.320
Shi Pu’s people stole the item from Shi Nai.

37
00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:25.300
That girl just now

38
00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:26.900
was also arranged by Shi Pu.

39
00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:29.280
These brothers

40
00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.640
are cut from the same cloth.

41
00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:32.340
All thieves.

42
00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.100
Grab them.

43
00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.360
Yes, sir.
