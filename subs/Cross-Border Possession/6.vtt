00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:06.040
So Mr. Huo has his eye on this

2
00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:07.820
girl, huh? Should’ve said so earlier.

3
00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:09.400
Since Mr. Huo’s taken a liking to you,

4
00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:12.000
stay and keep him company.

5
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.880
What do I do? I could’ve left, but now

6
00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.620
it seems I’m out of luck.

7
00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.440
When I passed by the next room just now,

8
00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:20.120
I saw a car parked outside,

9
00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:22.900
I’ll take this lady to the next room,

10
00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:24.340
wait for me to come back.

11
00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:26.680
Would Mr. Shi Nai mind?

12
00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:29.320
Hah, this little thing?

13
00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:32.620
Just a cracked egg.

14
00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:34.040
Of course I don’t mind,

15
00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:35.100
do as you please, sir.

16
00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:36.960
I’ll wait here for Mr. Huo.

17
00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:42.680
What is this…

18
00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:44.720
Blue-black canceled, switch to the Polish pen.

19
00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.000
Sir, what are you going to do?

20
00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:07.540
Why not call me “uncle”?

21
00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:25.490
Who sent you?

22
00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.550
That thing he just

23
00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:28.310
pulled off me,

24
00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:29.970
what was it? I want to know

25
00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.170
who sent me here too.

26
00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:32.890
All I know is the guy who grabbed me

27
00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:34.750
was wearing a white suit and looked intimidating,

28
00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:36.470
I don’t know anything else.

29
00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:38.730
I don’t know, I was just

30
00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:39.430
taken by them.

31
00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:41.230
They told me to come deliver drinks,

32
00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:43.110
and as long as I did what they said,

33
00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:44.910
they’d let me and my friend go.

34
00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:47.510
Sir, please believe me,

35
00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:48.650
I really…

36
00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:52.910
If you don’t want to die, shut up

37
00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:54.610
and cooperate with me.

38
00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:58.130
There’s someone watching me outside.

39
00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:59.850
I… I know you’re caught

40
00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:00.310
in some kind

41
00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:01.630
of terrifying conflict.

42
00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:03.470
Will you save me?

43
00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:06.470
Answer me.

44
00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:12.580
Leave it to me.

45
00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.100
He wants me to make noise on purpose,

46
00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:16.140
so the people outside

47
00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.980
watching us can hear,

48
00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.160
to throw off their surveillance.

49
00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:23.460
Louder.

50
00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:32.440
I said, louder.
