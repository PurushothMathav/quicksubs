00:00:04.566 --> 00:00:07.200
I hope the gods can hear this girl’s prayers

2
00:00:07.666 --> 00:00:10.400
and bless my mother to recover from her illness quickly,

3
00:00:10.666 --> 00:00:12.300
free from the torment of pain.

4
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:17.700
Thank you for the gods’ protection.

5
00:00 detail:53,200 --> 00:00:54,000
Hey,

6
00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:55.766
who’s that?

7
00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.233
Who? Obviously someone here to collect a debt.

8
00:01:00.266 --> 00:01:01.833
Cavilla’s property

9
00:01:02.133 --> 00:01:03.966
isn’t something any random thug

10
00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:28.600
Mr. Guo, don’t kill me!

11
00:01:32.466 --> 00:01:34.600
The item, half an hour ago,

12
00:01:34.666 --> 00:01:36.900
I stole it from the museum curator’s hands.

13
00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.100
Then I hid here.

14
00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.200
I didn’t expect Hou Jiuling to track me down so fast.

15
00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:41.633
As expected,

16
00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:43.966
Cavilla, the force that dominates the entire south,

17
00:01:43.966 --> 00:01:44.766
is truly

18
00:01:45.266 --> 00:01:47.800
a power not to be trifled with.

19
00:01:48.733 --> 00:01:49.533
Mr. Huo,

20
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
if I tell you where the item is,

21
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.600
can you spare my life?

22
00:02:02.366 --> 00:02:04.900
Mr. Huo, I didn’t mean to betray you.

23
00:02:05.066 --> 00:02:07.666
I was threatened by the Mengzhao family.

24
00:02:07.966 --> 00:02:09.833
The item is in the Mengzhao family’s hands.

25
00:02:16.066 --> 00:02:17.833
You’ve been with Cavilla for so long,

26
00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.766
and you still don’t know Mr. Huo’s temper?

27
00:02:20.566 --> 00:02:21.733
That man,

28
00:02:21.733 --> 00:02:23.400
he never does multiple-choice.

29
00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.400
The item and your life—

30
00:02:28.866 --> 00:02:31.466
he wants both. Don’t kill me!

31
00:02:31.666 --> 00:02:34.666
Don’t kill me! Don’t kill me! Don’t kill me!

32
00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:44.366
Oh no, I’ve stumbled into a murder scene!

33
00:03:08.666 --> 00:03:09.500
Uncle!

34
00:03:10.266 --> 00:03:12.033
But I haven’t seen anything, I swear!
