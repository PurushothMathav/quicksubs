00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.880
When you beat my future brother-in-law to death,

2
00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:04.000
did you ask if he wanted to die?

3
00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:05.620
Mr. Lin Qi,

4
00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:06.760
are you saying Wu Tai killed

5
00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:07.940
your future brother-in-law?

6
00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:08.900
But it was your brother-in-law

7
00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:09.900
who started it, wasn’t it?

8
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.220
Could you please let Wu Tai go?

9
00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:15.360
No… you sound so reasonable.

10
00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:16.220
But,

11
00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:18.020
I never reason.

12
00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:19.420
But little sister,

13
00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:21.000
if you want to save him,

14
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.140
it’s not impossible.

15
00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:25.480
I just have one small condition.

16
00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:26.480
I want

17
00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:31.260
that piece of land in Hou Jiuling’s Xixi…

18
00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:32.340
Hou Jiuling…

19
00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:32.760
I’m here.

20
00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:34.500
Can you…

21
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:35.680
Do you know how much

22
00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:36.940
that land is worth?

23
00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:38.060
Hmph, one billion.

24
00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:39.020
Euros.

25
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.080
I can’t possibly give you that land.

26
00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:42.260
Let’s discuss another condition.

27
00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:43.760
Since the deal’s off,

28
00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.000
no problem.

29
00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:46.740
Business may fail, but goodwill remains, right?

30
00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:47.060
Right?

31
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:48.640
Since we’re all here,

32
00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:50.320
let’s enjoy

33
00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.620
my personally crafted human bomb!

34
00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:53.160
No!

35
00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:54.360
I…

36
00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:58.480
Hou Jiuling, I’m begging you…

37
00:00:58.480 --> 00:00:59.760
That land is absolutely non-negotiable.

38
00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:00.740
Of course.

39
00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:05.320
Take your people out for a bit,

40
00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:06.880
I’ll think it over.

41
00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.000
Think it over? You’re still thinking?

42
00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:10.700
Fine, but,

43
00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.100
don’t take too long.

44
00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.000
I’ll give you five minutes,

45
00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:14.920
when time’s up.
