00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:01.760
Miss.

2
00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:03.180
May I help you?

3
00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:04.300
My boss says

4
00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:05.460
he has something to discuss

5
00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:06.780
with you. Please get in the car.

6
00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:08.920
Your boss? You mean

7
00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:09.660
Hou Jiuling?

8
00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.380
Yes.

9
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:11.940
Sorry, I have something to do,

10
00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:12.580
I’ll leave now.

11
00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:14.880
My boss says

12
00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:16.660
he might be able to solve your urgent problem.

13
00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:18.520
What does that mean?

14
00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.000
The leader of DS International

15
00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:21.520
just arranged a meeting with my boss.

16
00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:23.740
You’re talking about DS International?

17
00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:25.900
Yes. Please.

18
00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:37.740
Mr. Huo, you just had

19
00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:38.880
your subordinate tell me

20
00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:40.300
you could solve my urgent problem.

21
00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:42.540
One moment it’s “uncle,” then “big brother,”

22
00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:43.780
now “Mr. Huo,”

23
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.100
and sometimes “Hou Jiuling.”

24
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:46.780
In your heart,

25
00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:48.040
I have so many identities.

26
00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:49.360
Once we’re married,

27
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:50.880
should I have you call me something special?
