00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.940
We won't get divorced.

2
00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:04.000
Yes, sir, I understand.

3
00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:10.060
No way, you're getting married?

4
00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:11.380
Still with that young woman?

5
00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:12.120
Still with that young woman?

6
00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:13.740
That girl seems very nice.

7
00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:14.880
If you marry her,

8
00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:16.700
it should give her a sense of security.

9
00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:18.980
You shouldn't have not yet

10
00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:20.440
settled things with her, right?

11
00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.200
Don't come closer, what's up?

12
00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:27.440
Recently, there are a few small

13
00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:28.320
gangs acting restless nearby.

14
00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.620
I was thinking,

15
00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.120
how about we throw a party,

16
00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:31.860
or a banquet,

17
00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:33.040
to invite the leaders of

18
00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:34.380
those few gangs.

19
00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.180
Using this opportunity, to send a warning,

20
00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:40.600
to prevent those guys from being restless all the time.

21
00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:41.840
You arrange it.

22
00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:43.260
Who's the boss, anyway?

23
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:44.840
This position of mine,

24
00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:46.840
if you want it, you're welcome to it.

25
00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.720
So, where should we hold the banquet?

26
00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:53.660
Where would be a good place?

27
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.860
Then, let's choose my manor.

28
00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.180
Give me your passport later.

29
00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:59.360
What do you need my passport for?

30
00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:02.420
I'll have the lawyer go to the consulate to take care of some things.

31
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:04.200
What things?

32
00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:05.800
Not getting your birth certificate,

33
00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:07.180
but your single certificate.

34
00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.000
Why do you need my birth certificate?


35
00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.940
Of course, to marry me.

36
00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:14.620
Marry you?

37
00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.640
Huo Jiuling,

38
00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:18.400
why do you want to marry me?

39
00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:19.700
Want to get married, then get married.

40
00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:21.060
There aren't that many whys.

41
00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.240
But, but I think,

42
00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:24.620
marriage is something that two

43
00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:26.260
people in love do.

44
00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:27.700
And I don't like you,

45
00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:29.020
how could I possibly marry you?
