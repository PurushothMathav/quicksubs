00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:05.280
Doesn’t he understand? He’s not responding.

2
00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:07.480
Did he not understand what I said?

3
00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.520
Isn’t English the universal language?

4
00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:11.480
Besides Mandarin, Taiwanese, and English,

5
00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:13.560
can I not understand other languages? No, wait,

6
00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:14.920
I also know a bit of

7
00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:16.000
not-so-standard Italian.

8
00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.640
No, no, no,

9
00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:17.880
no,

10
00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:18.160
no, no,

11
00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:19.240
no, no, no,

12
00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:22.120
no.

13
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:31.540
Are you Chinese? You just called him

14
00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:37.800
“uncle”? Do you know his last name?

15
00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:42.500
B-Brother… I just—

16
00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:43.920
I really didn’t see anything.

17
00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.980
If you saw, you saw.

18
00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:49.420
It was just killing a traitor,

19
00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:50.920
no big deal.

20
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.060
No, no big deal?

21
00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:55.940
Then what’s a big deal?

22
00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.460
It’s late, go home already.

23
00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:00.000
Don’t wander around alone,

24
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.320
it’s dangerous.

25
00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:03.480
Brother…

26
00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.580
Wait, little sister,

27
00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:09.220
has anyone ever told you

28
00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.660
your Italian is really terrible?

29
00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.460
That little girl just now, sitting on the ground,

30
00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:25.700
trembling,

31
00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:27.600
with teary eyes that wouldn’t stop,

32
00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.940
she looked… kind of adorable.

33
00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.980
Lin, what are you thinking about?

34
00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:36.560
Thinking about that

35
00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.140
Chinese girl. If

36
00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.940
you’re interested,

37
00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:40.900
take her back to Rome.

38
00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:43.980
This is the first time I’ve seen you

39
00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:45.420
stare at a girl for so long.

40
00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:50.000
She just called you “uncle,”

41
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.960
and you’re only 26 this year, right?

42
00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.520
How does it feel to be promoted to uncle?

43
00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.000
If your tongue doesn’t want to shut up,

44
00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:00.620
I can have a meeting with it.

45
00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.840
Alright, you win.

46
00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.820
Mr. Huo, I heard you’re in Bangkok.

47
00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:08.580
Tomorrow night at 8, Night Club,

48
00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:09.500
don’t miss it.

49
00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.020
The head of the Mengzhao family,

50
00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:12.500
Shi Nai,

51
00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.260
already knows you’re in Bangkok.

52
00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:15.600
He’s invited you to meet tomorrow night at 8

53
00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.700
at his club. Are you going?

54
00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.880
Of course I’m going.

55
00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:25.660
Shi Nai had Paul

56
00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:27.340
steal your stuff,

57
00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.960
and now he’s proactively asking to meet.

58
00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:31.500
It’s obviously a trap,

59
00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:33.820
and on top of that,

60
00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.220
Bangkok is his turf.

61
00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.220
Is it?

62
00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.100
Then I’ll make it my turf.
