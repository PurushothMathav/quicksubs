1
00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:17.430
This isn’t mine… probably.

2
00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:18.130
It was at noon,

3
00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:19.690
when I went to the hospital to pick up a medical report,

4
00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:22.290
and I must’ve accidentally swapped it with someone else’s.

5
00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:29.040
Jin Lingling.

6
00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:31.180
It’s him.

7
00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:33.520
The biggest mafia force in Italy.

8
00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:35.040
The head of the Cavilla family,

9
00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:36.620
and the underworld godfather

10
00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:37.640
who makes the entire Nanhe tremble,

11
00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:38.900
Hou Jiuling.

12
00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:40.960
I’ve been hiding in Florence for two years,

13
00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.480
and I still can’t escape him?

14
00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:56.620
Jin Lingling,

15
00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:58.320
these past two years, I’ve been chasing enemies all over the world,

16
00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:00.080
but I never imagined

17
00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:01.420
you’d be hiding

18
00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:02.220
right under my nose.

19
00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:03.420
Jin Lingling!

20
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.560
Hou Jiuling, let me go!

21
00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:10.080
Do you know what these two years

22
00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.420
of searching for you have been like for me?

23
00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.540
Hou Jiuling, let me go!

24
00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:20.560
What are you afraid of?

25
00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:22.680
It’s not the first time you’ve left with me.

26
00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:28.370
Jin Lingling, you know

27
00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:29.890
when I want to do something to you,

28
00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.990
you can’t escape.

29
00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:38.830
Hou Jiuling, I’m already…

30
00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:45.010
If you don’t want to die with me,

31
00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:46.890
then let me go.

32
00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:54.610
Even though the name was torn off,

33
00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:55.890
can you still remember me?

34
00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:02.670
Jin Lingling, is this the life

35
00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:03.930
you so desperately left me to live?

36
00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:06.730
Living in this rundown house,

37
00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:07.710
and even raising a kid?

38
00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:13.660
These two years you’ve been gone,

39
00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:14.920
I haven’t touched

40
00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:15.600
another woman once.

41
00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:17.800
Tell me,

42
00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.320
in these two years since you left me,

43
00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.200
how many women have you been with

44
00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:22.160
to catch a disease like this?

45
00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.440
Let me go!

46
00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:27.940
Where are you taking me?

47
00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:32.420
You’ll know when we get there.

48
00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:33.940
Let’s go!

49
00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.860
Jin Lingling, I’m not letting you off.

50
00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:54.000
If you’ve got a kid,

51
00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:56.700
then I’ll die with you.
