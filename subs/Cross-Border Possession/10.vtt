00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:14.870
It’s dangerous outside right now.

2
00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:15.950
If you want to stay alive,

3
00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:17.330
stay put quietly.

4
00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:27.460
You!

5
00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:52.200
The boss is dead,

6
00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.740
and I don’t know why these idiots

7
00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:55.180
are still so loyal.

8
00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.240
No way, I have to do this?

9
00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.480
Otherwise, I’ll do it.

10
00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:07.980
Fine, fine, I know you’re a clean freak.

11
00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:09.500
I’ll do it.

12
00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.200
The item’s not on her.

13
00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:22.440
Lin, that little sister,

14
00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:23.160
is she Shi Nai’s person?

15
00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:25.180
Could the item be with her?

16
00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.100
She’s not Shi Nai’s person,

17
00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:30.500
the item probably isn’t with her.

18
00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:31.920
So where could Shi Nai

19
00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.520
have hidden the item? Bangkok’s huge,

20
00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:34.460
how do we find it?

21
00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.540
Lin, where are you going?

22
00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:40.460
We need to get out of here.

23
00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:44.980
Where is she?

24
00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.840
Did you see her leave just now?

25
00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:48.260
Her?
