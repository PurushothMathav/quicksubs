00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.220
No... I can't go.

2
00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:02.860
Since it's in his hands,

3
00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:04.960
let alone a small pill,

4
00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:06.980
even that bottle of mineral water

5
00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:08.420
can be discovered by me.

6
00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:12.920
We'll discuss you losing the person when I return from Thailand.

7
00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:14.760
(This line is redundant and can be removed after reviewing the context.  Leaving it in for now)

8
00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:16.320
Meeting adjourned!

9
00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:20.380
Linlin, your mother and I

10
00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:21.180
have already left,

11
00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.400
about forty minutes more

12
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:23.240
until we reach the airport.

13
00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.200
Left forty minutes ago...Dad

14
00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.540
and Mom should be at the airport by now.

15
00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:32.400
Hello, Linlin.

16
00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:33.900
Dad, where are you guys?

17
00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:35.640
Oh, your mother and I

18
00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.220
were in a car accident.

19
00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:38.920
A car accident? Where are you and Mom

20
00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:40.100
now? Are you okay?

21
00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:41.480
Don't worry,

22
00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:42.480
your mother and I are fine.

23
00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:44.460
We accidentally rear-ended

24
00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:45.400
the car in front;

25
00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:46.800
we could have died.

26
00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:47.860
I don't know why,

27
00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.400
the driver of the car ahead insisted on going to the police station.

29
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:51.980
So you're at the police station now,

30
00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.140
I'll come over now.

31
00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.740
Ms. Ji is here to see your parents?

32
00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.800
Yes.

33
00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:04.420
Come with me.
