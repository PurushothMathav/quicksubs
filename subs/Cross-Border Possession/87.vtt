00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:05.000
Sir, are you alright?

2
00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.100
Jin Lingling, are you okay?

3
00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.120
Was that sulfuric acid that sprayed from the corner?

4
00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.160
That liquid...was it sulfuric acid?

5
00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:15.480
If it's sulfuric acid,

6
00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:16.660
then why did Huo Jiuling rush

7
00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:17.160
over to help me?

8
00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:18.400
Speak!

9
00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:20.140
You...you're injured?

10
00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:21.040
I'm not going to die.

11
00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:23.880
Lingling! She's got me

12
00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.140
and my parents! Please save her!

13
00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:26.900
Make her release my parents!

14
00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:28.160
Why did you kidnap Wu Tai

15
00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:29.400
and her family?

16
00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:30.880
Is it because I secretly ran

17
00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:32.240
away and you're angry,

18
00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:33.780
so you took it out on her?

19
00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:34.980
Yes. Why am I

20
00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:35.620
so angry?

21
00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.000
I've never felt

22
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.120
like this before.

23
00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:39.860
I won't run away again.

24
00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:41.320
I'll be good and listen to you.

25
00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:42.760
Can you please release Wu Tai,

26
00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.060
and her family?

27
00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.940
Anyway, I can't seem to escape

28
00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:47.020
from her grasp.

29
00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.060
Jin Lingling, you're really pleading for her,

30
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.100
do you know what kind of person she is?

31
00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:51.420
It doesn't matter.

32
00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.520
It's none of my business.
