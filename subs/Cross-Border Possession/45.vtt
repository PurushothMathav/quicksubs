00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:02.080
Is this really habitable?

2
00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:04.580
My… goodness.

3
00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:05.760
This man, Huo Jiu Ling,

4
00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:07.000
how rich is he?

5
00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:09.340
Sir, you're back.

6
00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:11.100
Good sir.

7
00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:13.820
Isn't this white flour a little too

8
00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:14.500
excessive,

9
00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:15.100
even…

10
00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:16.160
I've arranged everything from

11
00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.740
my previous hospitality.

12
00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:18.620
Mr. Wei, everything is arranged.

13
00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:20.900
Arranged what?

14
00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.360
He brought me back to the old city,

15
00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.440
Is he going to do something to me?

16
00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:26.920
Huo Jiu Ling, I want to go home.

17
00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.200
This is your Italian home.

18
00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:31.720
But my personal belongings are still

19
00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:32.560
in the apartment,

20
00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:33.200
I want…

21
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.840
Miss Ji,

22
00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:35.260
the sir instructed us in advance,

23
00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:36.820
your personal belongings have already been

24
00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:37.840
placed in the room.

25
00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:39.940
My personal belongings…

26
00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:40.820
So you sent someone

27
00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:41.860
to break into my apartment.

28
00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.660
You needed to pry open that flimsy door?

29
00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.060
A single kick opened it.

30
00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:56.060
I have some things to take care of,

31
00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:57.680
you go to the room to take a shower first,

32
00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:58.940
then wait for me in the room.
