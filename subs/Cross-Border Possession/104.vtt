1
00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:06.980
Sir, Miss Ji, welcome back.

2
00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:08.520
Welcome back.  From now on, please address me as

3
00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:10.480
Madam. Sir.

4
00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:11.900
Allow me to introduce

5
00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:13.580
my wife.

6
00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:15.600
Ji Pinglu, from the Netherlands.

7
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.300
My wife.  It's been a while.

8
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:18.480
Dier, my younger sister.

9
00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:19.880
You've met my sister before.  And Zoro,

10
00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:21.040
my butler and

11
00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:22.100
intelligence analyst.  Lei

12
00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:23.740
De, my lawyer.

13
00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:24.760
And Rui Ao,

14
00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:28.700
my deputy head of firepower.

15
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.520
I'll let the matter of you losing someone slide.

16
00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.120
We're not going to pursue it.

17
00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:39.240
We had you come all this way

18
00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:40.080
to the airport to formally

19
00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.040
introduce his wife.

20
00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:41.780
.

21
00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.340
Since your brother returned from Thailand,

22
00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:45.940
he seems much calmer.

23
00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.240
Marriage clearly has

24
00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:50.460
a significant effect on men.

25
00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.580
Indeed.

26
00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:53.940
Someone I recently assisted contacted me,

27
00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:55.800
saying they urgently need supplies.

28
00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:57.960
The quantity is far greater than in any previous transaction

29
00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.200
they've had with us.

30
00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:00.020
By far.
