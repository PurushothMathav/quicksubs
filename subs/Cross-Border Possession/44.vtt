1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.560
Mrs. Wu is very badly injured.

2
00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:02.540
If we don't send her to the hospital,

3
00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:03.280
she will die.

4
00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:08.520
Li Qi, send her to the hospital.

5
00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:09.820
If she dies,

6
00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:11.360
we don't need to talk about our contract.

7
00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:14.800
Huo Jiu Ling!

8
00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:15.540
Lian Lian!

9
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:16.740
Huo Jiu Ling!

10
00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:17.780
Huo Jiu Ling!

11
00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:18.260
Lian Lian!

12
00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.920
Lian Lian!

13
00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:19.600
Lian Lian!

14
00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:23.620
Boss, when we found her,

15
00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:25.140
her ribs were already broken.

16
00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:27.540
Huo Jiu Ling!

17
00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:29.320
You're a murderer!

18
00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:30.900
What are you doing standing there?

19
00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:31.600
Hurry up and send her to the hospital.

20
00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.380
That, Huo Jiu Ling,

21
00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:35.780
Mrs. Luo is seriously injured,

22
00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:37.900
I'm worried and want to go to the hospital to see her.

23
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:39.840
Are you a doctor or a nurse?

24
00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:41.460
What good will it do you to go to the hospital?

25
00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:43.860
I just want to check.

26
00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:45.140
She won't die,

27
00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:46.920
she's worth 1.5 billion Chinese Yuan,

28
00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:48.440
Li Qi won't let her die.

29
00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:54.060
Blow up all of Li Qi's

30
00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:55.080
establishments in Rome.

31
00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:57.480
These people deal with

32
00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:58.080
you this way,

33
00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:59.120
is that how they always treat you?

34
00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:01.300
I'm really so violent,

35
00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:02.540
I need to think carefully,

36
00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:04.320
how I can leave this man.

37
00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:07.520
Where are you taking me?

38
00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.480
Ji Ling, do you know what

39
00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:11.200
sound that is?

40
00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:13.640
Your… your woman…

41
00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.120
shows your true feelings.

42
00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:18.580
It's almost midnight now,

43
00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:20.960
where do you think I'll take you?
