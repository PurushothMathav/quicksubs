00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:04.960
That... today is the weekend,

2
00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:07.000
Is your company off?

3
00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:09.340
No.

4
00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.760
However,

5
00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:16.600
If you want to go out and play,

6
00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:18.140
you can also take a day off.

7
00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:20.460
Really? Then give me Diya's

8
00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:21.500
contact information.

9
00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:24.000
What do you want her contact information for?

10
00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:26.260
I'm not very familiar with this place,

11
00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.700
so I just want Diya to take me around.

12
00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:33.640
Jilingling, do you feel I've been neglecting you as your husband?

13
00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:34.920
as your husband?

14
00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.980
Want to go out and play,

15
00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.040
why don't you ask me to take you around?

16
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.840
I just think you're always so busy,

17
00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:44.100
always so busy,

18
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.040
I always feel bad about bothering you.

19
00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:00.520
Diya, I'm giving you the day off.

20
00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:02.820
Why the sudden day off?

21
00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:05.400
Today, take Jilingling

22
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.460
out to have some fun,

23
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:07.620
and relax.

24
00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:08.760
Really?

25
00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.190
Diya, I think I'll leave first,

26
00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:21.850
I have something to do.

27
00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:24.630
Since you're here, have some fun before you leave.

28
00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:27.090
Um, please go back to your seats.

29
00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.230
Good evening, both bosses.

30
00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.670
You, come here.

31
00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.410
Touch it.
