00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:07.260
What happened?

2
00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:08.280
He fled the manor.

3
00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:10.660
Huh? Your manor is heavily guarded.

4
00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:11.940
How could he possibly have gotten away?

5
00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:13.880
Holland, take a team and

6
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.120
block off all roads around

7
00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:15.820
the manor.

8
00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:16.620
Take another team and

9
00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:18.200
set up checkpoints at the station and docks,

10
00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.080
thoroughly checking all passengers and guards.

11
00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:22.040
Conduct a complete search of all hotels and inns

12
00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:23.220
within the city.

13
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.820
OK.

14
00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:28.620
Sir, we just found

15
00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:29.240
bloodstains in the flower shop,

16
00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:30.220
it seems to beâ€¦

17
00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:31.020
Miss Ji's bloodstain.

18
00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:46.150
Keep searching. Every corner of the manor

19
00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:47.270
needs to be checked again.

20
00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:47.870
Yes.

21
00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:54.860
Let's check over here.

22
00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:04.500
Nothing. Let's go.

23
00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:15.260
Those few women

24
00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:16.440
friends didn't see me.

25
00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:17.800
If I were wearing this outfit

26
00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:18.780
and walked out the gate,

27
00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:20.340
I probably wouldn't be noticed either.
