00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.620
What does he want?

2
00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:03.240
Is it my body?

3
00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:04.840
If he only wants that,

4
00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:06.380
then after he gets it,

5
00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:07.660
will he let me go?

6
00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:08.900
Forget it,

7
00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:10.540
this man is so fickle,

8
00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:11.900
I can't possibly guess

9
00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:13.000
his intentions.

10
00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:15.160
Huo Jiuling,

11
00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:16.720
can I talk to you

12
00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:17.760
about something else?

13
00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:21.020
What do you want? Tell me.

14
00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:22.520
I want to see Wu Tai.

15
00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:26.580
Ji Linning,

16
00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:28.100
you're still thinking of

17
00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:29.140
Wu Tai, aren't you?

18
00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:30.340
No,

19
00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:32.160
I'm just a little worried,

20
00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:34.160
wanting to check on him.

21
00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:36.220
Didn't I tell you

22
00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:37.160
he won't die?

23
00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:38.760
Remember your current

24
00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.300
position.  From now on,

25
00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:41.820
don't let me hear that

26
00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.480
name again.

27
00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:47.960
I have something to do,

28
00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:49.700
I need to go out.  You were up all

29
00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:50.560
night,

30
00:00:51.020 --> 00:01:03.260
go rest.  Don't even think about escaping.

31
00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:04.500
Don't even think about escaping.

32
00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:09.940
Is he dead?

33
00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.260
Sir, he's not dead yet,

34
00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.800
but his arm is seriously injured,

35
00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:14.320
requiring amputation to save his life.

36
00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:15.740
Amputate it,

37
00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:17.080
but don't let him die.

38
00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.340
But during the amputation,

39
00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:19.880
don't give him any anesthetic.

40
00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:21.160
Yes, sir.

41
00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:27.960
Miss Ji, where are you going?

42
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:28.900
I'm full,

43
00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:30.060
I want to walk around the manor,

44
00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:31.180
to get familiar with it,

45
00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:32.860
and find a way to escape.

46
00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:34.320
The manor is large,

47
00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.740
you'll get lost alone,

48
00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:36.860
let me take you for a walk.

49
00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:38.080
Okay.
