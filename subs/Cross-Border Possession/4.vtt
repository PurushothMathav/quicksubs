00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.340
Xuelian, thank you for

2
00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:05.380
coming with me to pray today.

3
00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:07.560
Hey, Linlin, come to my place for dinner.

4
00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.260
We’ve got spicy tofu at noon,

5
00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:10.280
steamed pork ribs,

6
00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:12.920
spicy chicken hotpot, and beer-braised duck.

7
00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:15.200
It’s not convenient, I’d better not go.

8
00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:16.740
Hmm…

9
00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:17.640
Alright then.

10
00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:24.920
We’re here, let’s get off.

11
00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:25.340
Okay.

12
00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:37.500
Where’s Xuelian? Where is she?

13
00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:38.300
We haven’t been

14
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:39.500
kidnapped by traffickers, have we?

15
00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:43.700
Xuelian! Xuelian! Is anyone there?

16
00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:51.880
Y-You… what do you want?

17
00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.040
We haven’t done anything to you.

18
00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:59.840
And we won’t do anything to you.

19
00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.390
Little sister, don’t be scared.

20
00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:14.950
Your big brother here

21
00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:16.770
just needs a small favor.

22
00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:19.770
You won’t kill me?

23
00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:21.450
What do you want me to do?

24
00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.210
It’s simple.

25
00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.570
We just need… this.

26
00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.430
Hey, not bad.

27
00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:32.710
Yes, just like that.

28
00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:46.970
Wow, Mr. Huo, the king himself has arrived!

29
00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:06.570
Mr. Huo, you’re right on time.

30
00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:08.570
Sweetheart, go keep Mr. Huo company.

31
00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:10.350
Please.

32
00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:17.840
Mr. Shi Nai,

33
00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.080
do you think I’d want your leftovers?

34
00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:25.900
Oh, my apologies for the oversight.

35
00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:28.760
You all, leave.

36
00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:33.180
Go find the manager,

37
00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:35.040
tell him to find some new girls.

38
00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.480
No need for women, Mr. Shi Nai.

39
00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.800
You had my stuff stolen,

40
00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.120
don’t you owe me an explanation?

41
00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:48.560
I invited you several

42
00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:49.360
times, Mr. Huo,

43
00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:51.520
but you refused to show up.

44
00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:52.820
That’s why I resorted to this.

45
00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.620
I’ve heard you own

46
00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.480
numerous top-tier car factories in Italy.

47
00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:00.560
If you’re willing to

48
00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:01.640
work with me,

49
00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.580
I believe we can achieve

50
00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:06.640
a win-win situation.

51
00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.660
Mr. Shi Nai, are you so sure

52
00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:17.760
I’ll work with you?

53
00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:29.370
Lin, look, who’s that?
