Read it first, then write.

2
00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:07.930
Respected Town Hall, hello.

3
00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:09.330
For Mr. Huo Jiuling

4
00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:10.630
and Ms. Qi Lingling's

5
00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:11.770
marriage registration ceremony,

6
00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:14.590
I strongly object to this marriage.

7
00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:15.750
My reasons are as follows:

8
00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:18.250
My friend, Ms. Catherine, one year ago

9
00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:20.770
met and fell in love with Mr. Huo Jiuling.

10
00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.070
Mr. Huo Jiuling promised to marry Catherine

11
00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.630
and

12
00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:27.110
Ms. Catherine is currently

13
00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:28.610
three months pregnant.

14
00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:31.210
However, Mr. Huo Jiuling is now marrying another woman while Catherine is pregnant.

15
00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:32.890
He is abandoning her during her pregnancy,

16
00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:34.690
and marrying another woman.

17
00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:35.950
This is completely

18
00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:38.150
disregarding the fact that Catherine is still pregnant.


19
00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:40.370
I sincerely hope

20
00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:41.790
the Town Hall will reject

21
00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:42.990
Mr. Huo Jiuling's

22
00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:46.610
and Ms. Qi's marriage registration.
