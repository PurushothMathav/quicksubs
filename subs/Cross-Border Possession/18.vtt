00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:02.660
How do I explain this? Should I say

2
00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:03.180
I was pinned against a wall

3
00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:04.920
and kissed by a strange man?

4
00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:06.660
And that man also

5
00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:08.200
forced me to break up?

6
00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:09.060
I’m fine.

7
00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:14.000
Have some water.

8
00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:16.340
Thanks, Wu Tai.

9
00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:17.680
Sorry,

10
00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:18.700
I accidentally

11
00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:19.660
lost your camera earlier.

12
00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:21.080
When we get back to Rome,

13
00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.960
I’ll buy you a new one.

14
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:23.740
Nah, it’s fine. That

15
00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:24.540
camera wasn’t expensive anyway.

16
00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:25.640
But, Linlin,

17
00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:27.520
what… what happened just now?

18
00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.980
Wu Tai, I just ran

19
00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:30.920
into a man.

20
00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:32.920
He told us to break up.

21
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:上方:35,880
Does he think dating is child’s play,

22
00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:36.980
breaking up just like that?

23
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:38.060
But, Linlin,

24
00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:39.780
why would he do that?

25
00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.320
Could it be… he likes you too?

26
00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:45.800
He can’t possibly like me.

27
00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:47.280
A cold-blooded killer like him,

28
00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.580
could he even like someone?

29
00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:51.580
What he likes is probably just the thrill

30
00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:52.920
of taking and conquering.

31
00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.900
Then he must be seriously messed up.

32
00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.940
What right does he have

33
00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:58.840
to make us break up,

34
00:00:58.860 --> 00:00:59.080
right?

35
00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.240
But… he’s terrifying.

36
00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:05.800
He… he’s killed people.

37
00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:09.820
How do you know?

38
00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:11.680
Back in Bangkok,

39
00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:13.120
I saw them fighting

40
00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:13.940
at the club.

41
00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:16.020
A lot of people died at the scene.

42
00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:19.020
It’s okay, Linlin.

43
00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.220
As long as we get back to Rome,

44
00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:23.440
you’ll be safe. Let’s go.

45
00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:27.080
Let’s go.

46
00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:30.380
