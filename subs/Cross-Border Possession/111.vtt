Sir, City Hall just

2
00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:02.440
just contacted me,

3
00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:03.820
saying someone sent them

4
00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:05.880
an anonymous email last night,

5
00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:08.240
opposing your and your husband's

6
00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:09.300
marriage registration.

7
00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:12.200
The email content?

8
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.160
I've just sent it to

9
00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.000
your email.

10
00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:24.740
The email content shows

11
00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:25.680
who sent the email?

12
00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:27.500
Zoro has checked the sender's

13
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:28.480
IP address of this email,

14
00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:32.260
the IP address originates from your manor.

15
00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:43.240
Come here.

16
00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:00.060
The anonymous email I sent to City Hall

17
00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:00.840
before,

18
00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:02.660
how did it end up in Huo Jiu Yun's hands?

19
00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:04.100
Don't panic, don't panic,

20
00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:05.840
the email address is secretly registered.

21
00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:08.020
Even if Huo Jiu Yun is incredibly resourceful,

22
00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:09.620
he can't be sure this email

23
00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:11.900
was sent by me, right? What is this?

24
00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.120
You'll have to take responsibility for your actions.

25
00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:20.460
This wasn't written by me.

26
00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.460
What to do? Should I run away?

27
00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:25.840
I'll take a shower first.

28
00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:30.360
I'll wash the dishes afterwards.

29
00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:33.420
I'll wash the dishes first.
