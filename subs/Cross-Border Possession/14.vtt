00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:05.000
Take a look, Rome Academy of Fine Arts.

2
00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:09.820
In the world’s art capital,

3
00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.760
the Rome Academy of Fine Arts in Italy,

4
00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:13.260
with its eternal history,

5
00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:14.640
profound cultural significance,

6
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.380
and renowned art education…

7
00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:18.700
This letter… that

8
00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:19.380
terrifying man

9
00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:20.280
and his friend were speaking

10
00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:20.940
Italian.

11
00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:23.720
He… he’s not Italian, is he?

12
00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:25.280
It can’t be that coincidental, right?

13
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.240
If I run into him again,

14
00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:28.540
he wouldn’t really

15
00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:29.380
snap my neck, would he?

16
00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:33.060
Taking a step back,

17
00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:34.960
even if he is Italian,

18
00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:36.300
Italy is huge,

19
00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.000
I couldn’t possibly run into him again.

20
00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:45.660
Linlin, the climate in Europe,

21
00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:46.900
the environment, the culture,

22
00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.120
and the food habits

23
00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:49.180
are completely different

24
00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:50.740
from Bangkok. Over there,

25
00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:52.120
you must take good care of yourself.

26
00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.220
Got it, Mom. Don’t worry.

27
00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:56.860
Alright.

28
00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:57.760
If you need anything,

29
00:00:58.800 --> 00:00:59.980
you can call me anytime.

30
00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:03.880
Thank you, Uncle.

31
00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:05.360
I’m off. Bye.
