00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:08.250
Remember Lingling, keep dragging.

2
00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:16.750
Mr. Zou, no, I'm upset.

3
00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:22.290
Remember Lingling, I don't accept that.

4
00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:23.910
Don't be angry at me

5
00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.430
when you have a cold.

6
00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:29.430
Ugh, this is so embarrassing and awful!

7
00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:30.850
(No additional translation needed)

8
00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:33.530
(No additional translation needed)

9
00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:34.290
Don't.

10
00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:38.670
Go out.

11
00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:53.770
This afternoon,

12
00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:57.490
we've stocked the Tigeguo medicine, as planned.  Tonight at 8,

14
00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:59.370
it'll be shipped across on the ferry,

15
00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.470
but just now, the goods were ready.

16
00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:05.850
Found out who did it?

17
00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:11.690
While there's no concrete evidence yet, the evidence and clues directly point to the culprit.

18
00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:13.810
But judging by the motive,

24
00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:15.650
the Glorious Society is the prime suspect.

25
00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:20.330
Find out within three days,

26
00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:23.290
if the Glorious Society has the goods.

28
00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:25.690
Sir, one more thing.

29
00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:26.430
Speak.

30
00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:35.000
The police chief wants an explanation for our embassy raid; apparently, the embassy has already addressed it.

36
00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:38.270
Such a simple thing requires my input?

38
00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:40.630
Finding a scapegoat would be more convenient, wouldn't it?

39
00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.690
Sir, who's the scapegoat?

40
00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:51.670
Such a great opportunity... it goes to the Glorious Society.

42
00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.210
Understood.
