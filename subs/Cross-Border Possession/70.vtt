Hey, Linda, where are you?

2
00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:06.880
How did you disappear so quickly?

3
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:07.740
Miss Qi, what's wrong?

4
00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:10.960
Nothing, I just feel the manor is too big and got lost.

5
00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:11.900
and I got lost.

6
00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:12.620
Miss Qi,

7
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.160
it's so late tonight,

8
00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:14.980
you're going out,

9
00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:16.500
is there something urgent?

10
00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:18.160
Linda, can I ask you

11
00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:19.260
for a favor?

12
00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:19.980
What favor?

13
00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:21.700
I can't leave the manor now,

14
00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.020
but I want to ask you to help me

15
00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:23.980
go find a friend,

16
00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.400
help me confirm where she is,

17
00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:26.480
and what's going on?

18
00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:27.440
Who is she?

19
00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:28.640
Her name is Wu Tai,

20
00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:29.960
she's seriously injured,

21
00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:31.280
she should be in the hospital now.

22
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:32.680
This Wu Tai,

23
00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:34.100
who is she to you?

24
00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.480
She is... she was my ex-boyfriend,

25
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.560
I'll send you her picture now.

26
00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:40.640
Okay.

27
00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:44.760
Sent, please help me.

28
00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:45.900
Okay.

29
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.820
Sir, are you serious about marrying Miss Qi?  Legally, she'd inherit a substantial portion of your assets.  However,  a future separation would also involve significant risks.

30
00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.500
Reid, there is no such risk.

31
00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:15.400
We won't get divorced.
