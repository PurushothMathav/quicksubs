00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:04.040
If this is what you call means,

2
00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:06.920
Then you can't successfully trust.

3
00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.280
That's right. I am indeed the host of Dianzang Huaxia.

4
00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.560
But my plan was written word for word by my own hand.

5
00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:19.770
Today I am here to explain the appointment,

6
00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:22.670
Just came to the chat meeting. What are you doing here?

7
00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:24.870
You ask everyone in the foreign praise field,

8
00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:26.930
That one is not a rich and powerful person.

9
00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:30.710
Only when Xiang Yuan is like this can he be qualified to accept the request.

10
00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:33.730
I think you're just here to make up for the chaos.

11
00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:39.510
Wrong words imply that it doesn’t matter who wrote it.

12
00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.130
They only care about power

13
00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:44.110
Besides, you're a bastard

14
00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:47.510
I still won’t let you go

15
00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:49.350
already know me

16
00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:50.890
I am not qualified to participate in doing this above

17
00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:53.930
You just need to make a clear distinction first

18
00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.030
Just judge a person's temper and brother

19
00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.930
You are the only one who deserves to be promoted to twenty

20
00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:09.260
Two personalities once failed

21
00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.460
Give it a try

22
00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:22.770
Because I suggested it

23
00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.270
Block this guy completely

24
00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:27.470
How about letting him go out on his knees eight times?

25
00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:34.930
I don’t have privacy yet

26
00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.390
I can sin negative negative negative negative negative negative negative negative negative negative negative negative negative negative negative negative negative negative negative negative negative negative negative negative negative negative negative negative negative negative negative negative negative negative negative negative negative negative negative negative negative negative negative negative negative negative
