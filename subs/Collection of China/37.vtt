1
00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:02.570
I only look at strength,

2
00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:04.080
Capital cannot control the stage,

3
00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.880
Itâ€™s even more difficult to stick to your body and lose your talent. On strength,

4
00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.260
We describe this as a complaint from the University of Joaquin.

5
00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.600
To be honest, if you finish this dance,

6
00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:14.800
How much heat can you bring to our tracing?

7
00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:19.120
Are you just recruiting people? Everyone is bad.

8
00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:38.190
Why don't you leave quickly?

9
00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.910
Go back to this old teacher to find him

10
00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:51.150
You can't sleep with someone and meet who he is

11
00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:58.560
Didn't even talk about the little things

12
00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:05.099
So you helped the female boss?

13
00:01:05.099 --> 00:01:06.600
I thought I had a lot of money

14
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.720
Dare to fight against capital like Criminal Law

15
00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.540
A small company like Criminal

16
00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:15.270
What a big challenge

17
00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.780
Let me see who is my colleague
