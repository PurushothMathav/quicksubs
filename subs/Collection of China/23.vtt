00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.700
What. Does this show have anything to do with you from the beginning?

2
00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:06.220
Why don't you send someone out to come here to kill Yi?

3
00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:10.180
We are related. You are not interested in each other.

4
00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:15.610
This planning. Whether it’s creativity or lines.

5
00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:18.260
It takes all my effort not to say every word.

6
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:27.270
Don't send it to me. Put this piece of trash away.

7
00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:32.520
It might be better to read that my friend sent me the case for the teacher.

8
00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.100
You are more certain. If not, then plan it,

9
00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.080
What a release. This program is planned.

10
00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:41.120
Get out. OK.

11
00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:46.480
Kai has the ability. You can also deliver food. I'm so nice

12
00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:49.000
Anna Song wrote something wrong

13
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.820
There are no high-level talents in the profession

14
00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:59.260
It’s not like you recommend it

15
00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:04.800
You have always been at the bottom

16
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.340
This pheasant

17
00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:09.020
I will always be a phoenix.

18
00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.180
Then what is the plan for this show?

19
00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:16.860
I think you took advantage of Miaomiao not paying attention

20
00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.910
The logic of going big with the wind

21
00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:25.180
That teacher is your unfamiliarity

22
00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:28.140
What a thief

23
00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.720
A green fate has given him talent

24
00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:39.540
In this plan, every word from head to toe is not mine.

25
00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.780
The participation in this show is about you not trying, right?

26
00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:52.670
Click and hide

27
00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:54.430
Indeed I tried

28
00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:57.900
I you leave now

29
00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.580
Once the space is gone, I can be left speechless.
