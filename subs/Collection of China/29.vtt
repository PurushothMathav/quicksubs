00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:02.480
Cut. There must be.

2
00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:04.520
I haven't watched many people.

3
00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.540
You are not only talented. Hosting Public Enemies is so good too.

4
00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.680
One more time to pass. How about it? Do you want to go to my balcony and be a cell phone organizer?

5
00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.240
Balcony gesture host?

6
00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:19.920
Love the balcony. I'm just not the leader of a few shows.

7
00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.220
Qian Lao. This guy is just a salesman.

8
00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.280
I commend the Chinese host who I haven’t seen yet.

9
00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:28.490
It’s the Niu Niu Niu host. Is there any misunderstanding?

10
00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:33.860
Liuli, you Chinese people have such good talents, so you don’t need to

11
00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:36.020
Spend money to hire a popular idol

12
00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:37.930
Why do you think you are too long?

13
00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:39.770
You misunderstood

14
00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:41.790
This guy is here to cause trouble

15
00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.120
It seems you are here to cause chaos.

16
00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.940
Stealing Miaomiao's plan

17
00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:50.840
Just not married

18
00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:52.560
Stole your plan

19
00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:57.370
The plan he stole

20
00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:01.050
This prevented him from waiting in conspiracy

21
00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:09.400
Such a good plan was ruined

22
00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:10.920
You guys are such bastards

23
00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.660
Something with eyes but no feet
