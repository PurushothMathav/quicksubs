00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:03.160
Think about the pressure shared by new professionals,

2
00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:06.310
The swarm's original body. I just happened to be lucky.

3
00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:10.960
Know. Although you were nice to me just now,

4
00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:13.820
Your achievements don't seem to matter at all.

5
00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:35.940
Think about it, what do you think of my tea?

6
00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:44.470
What do you mean? Am I afraid that I will poison you?

7
00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:57.220
No, could it be that this person is poisonous?

8
00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:06.750
If both cups agree with the plan,

9
00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:11.070
You have been in poor health. If you drink this tea,

10
00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:17.790
But if there is a problem with both cups of tea

11
00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:26.120
How can anyone beat this?

12
00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.820
It's almost coming on my head

13
00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:31.700
It seems that the graphics of this tea are not strong

14
00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.090
Or the classmate of Starry Night

15
00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:40.160
Who doesn't want you to show up in her heart

16
00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:49.400
if we will continue to continue
