1
00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.940
silence. What are you here for?

2
00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:07.200
silence. Today is not the place for you to come.

3
00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:09.180
Today is the class award for the new profession.

4
00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:12.000
Do you look at the greasy parts below?

5
00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.860
I am the new award winner. I am very much.

6
00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:18.160
The new award winner is trash.

7
00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:20.900
Unexpectedly, it's so cute.

8
00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:23.600
Good, good, good. New Award. Collect your games.

9
00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:26.960
want. Might as well leave.

10
00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:29.430
What? Not willing to give in,

11
00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:34.490
Just master this trash and use it to launch missiles

12
00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:36.760
you just went well

13
00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.150
If I just heard it right

14
00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:43.790
It's this little thing

15
00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:45.470
It’s not my turn to decide the new prize yet.

16
00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:48.010
I will what you think

17
00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:49.850
The new award winner is you, right?

18
00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.530
He wouldn't think that this new career

19
00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:00.200
A person who came up with a written record

20
00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:07.640
I'm so distraught

21
00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:12.460
Xingzhi has always been a princess

22
00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:14.100
I hope to death that I will get the money back

23
00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.800
It's the people who won these installations

24
00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.460
Only by sticking to the princess can you become yourself

25
00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:23.760
You are the one who installed it, right?

26
00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:26.280
Fresh stone's Lu Qiwei pesters mother

27
00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.100
Later, there was a Meng father who continued to live in the northern country.

28
00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.780
I knew so many names just now

29
00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.420
After seeing it, we have nothing to talk about.

30
00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.330
i want you to be angry

31
00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:46.150
Then I have to say no.

32
00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:48.130
Then you also have this qualification

33
00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:51.000
You don’t really think you are a little liar

34
00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.040
I can really help you get up.

35
00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:00.780
I woke up early and was hospitalized

36
00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.920
Wait until he is hospitalized

37
00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.720
That will be a few days later too

38
00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:07.450
It's too late for you now

39
00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:09.650
We don't even have to look for teachers.

40
00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.180
Mo...mo...you stole my words

41
00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.940
You'd better come up with this today

42
00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.100
Otherwise I will kill your mouth

43
00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:20.800
Then I will give you this evidence
