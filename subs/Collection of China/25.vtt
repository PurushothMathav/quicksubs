00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:02.009
Prince, why are you here?

2
00:00:02.009 --> 00:00:05.470
I'm cooperating outside, and I've received your thumbs up, and I'm going to

3
00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:08.790
Immediately the horses came over without stopping.

4
00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:11.900
I see who we are created to be.

5
00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.930
Come and ask for data. There is a long belt,

6
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.820
It’s all of you out there,

7
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.030
Whoever can have it, I’ll ask first. Are you sending it to foreigners?

8
00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:28.880
Xu Huasheng, do you still want to do it?

9
00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:31.920
Combined with such an important occasion,

10
00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.560
How could you let someone who was sent away from home sneak in?

11
00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:42.470
The battery found it disadvantageous to have such a good hand

12
00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:44.430
If you can support me

13
00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.150
How can a program have such a good coverage rate?

14
00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:58.100
Please keep it safe

15
00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.280
I can go

16
00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.030
But you must bring me usually

17
00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:10.920
Where is you here? This is yours

18
00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.790
Point to hide the yellow direction
