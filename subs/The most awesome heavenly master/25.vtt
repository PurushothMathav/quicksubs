1
00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.120
We are going to buy a dress.

2
00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:02.800
Please let's take a look at the self-healing selection.

3
00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:04.760
I'm so busy, what's your attitude?

4
00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:08.220
This gentleman thinks our attitude is not good, so he goes to the opposite house to have a look.

5
00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:10.920
Our family takes the high-end luxury route

6
00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.660
You can't afford it

7
00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.220
The discount on the opposite house is very suitable for you.

8
00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:17.460
Just your dog-eyed attitude of looking down on people

9
00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:19.480
I will not buy clothes at your house.

10
00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:20.200
Love to buy or not

11
00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.140
Can you afford it, you hillbillies?

12
00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:24.880
If you two don't dislike it

13
00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:26.380
I can help you choose a household.

14
00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:30.380
Well, birds of a feather flock together.

15
00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.860
What kind of shopping guide brings what kind of customers?

16
00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.540
Lower the grade of our store

17
00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:37.660
What price clothes do you want to choose?

18
00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:40.200
Look at how poor they are

19
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.980
What other price could it be?

20
00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:44.580
Of course, the lowest-priced junk.

21
00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.420
Help me choose the cheapest one.

22
00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.220
Yes, sir. Please follow me.

23
00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.600
Sir, this dress is only 3,000 yuan.

24
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:52.860
Do you want to pack it for you?

25
00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.980
Don't put it back

26
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.800
I can't even afford the cheapest clothes

27
00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.580
Poor is poor

28
00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:01.620
Except for this dress

29
00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.540
Wrap all the clothes in your store for me
