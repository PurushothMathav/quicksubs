00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:06.580
Are you here for an interview?

4
00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:09.940
Aren't you being taken care of?

5
00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:11.640
Did you break up?

6
00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:13.340
So I came looking for a job

7
00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.040

There is still face to come to our company for an interview

17
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:33.860
It's incurable

18
00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:35.200
But

19
00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:37.700
It's not impossible

20
00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:39.340
It depends on Xiao Song.

21
00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:41.060

27
00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:55.340
