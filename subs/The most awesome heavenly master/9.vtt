1
00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:05.940
Zhang Cheng you

2
00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:07.480
You are still alive

3
00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:08.660
Long time no see.

4
00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:09.980
Yang Bingbing

5
00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:11.780
Zhao Zipeng

6
00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:14.320
Humph

7
00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:16.280
What are you doing here?

8
00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:17.720
Is he now?

9
00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:19.180
Workers chasing poor students

10
00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:20.840
The scum of society

11
00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:22.960
It must be because you have made great progress now

12
00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:24.280
I want to corrupt a sum of money

13
00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:25.080
Zhang Cheng

14
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.460
What about the past, let him go

15
00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.740
I advise you to look forward

16
00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:35.040
So you can go to work for my fiancÃ©'s company

17
00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.960
I asked them to hire you exceptionally

18
00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.420
As if I repay you

19
00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:41.620
No need for Zhang Cheng

20
00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.540
Don't be shameless.

21
00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:47.440
I was forced to be with Zhao Zipeng back then

22
00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.620
It's you who don't live up to your expectations, and you can't blame me.

23
00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:53.700
Now I'm not what I used to be

24
00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.860
If you dare to pester me again

25
00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:57.980
It will make your life worse than death

26
00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.660
Yang Bingbing was the one who betrayed him

27
00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.380
How can you say such a thing shamelessly?

28
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.260
Betrayal hahaha

29
00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:11.060
The world is cruel and realistic

30
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.040
If I had followed him, this trash

31
00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.220
Where is the present glory and wealth

32
00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:20.900
To blame, he can only blame himself for not being able to support the wall in the mud

33
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.920
After all, how can a pheasant be worthy of a phoenix?

34
00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.340
Ahahaha

35
00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.220
Yang Bingbing, you don't really think I still care about you, do you?

36
00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.180
So what if you marry into the Past Life Group?

37
00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:35.400
Was the Past Life Group great?

38
00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.980
My Past Life Group
