00:00:00.966 --> 00:00:03.866
Did my brother-in-law ask you to save me?

2
00:00:04.666 --> 00:00:06.300
Why didn't brother-in-law come?

3
00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:12.066
Sister, why don't you talk, sister?

4
00:00:14.933 --> 00:00:15.966
sister

5
00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:18.066
Linman

6
00:00:18.966 --> 00:00:20.600
You don't know Chu Minghua at all

7
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.266
What kind of person is he?

8
00:00:22.266 --> 00:00:24.300
You have no idea how scary he is

9
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.800
Sister, you know it all

10
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.766
Do you think he really loves you?

11
00:00:27.766 --> 00:00:29.633
You can be here today

12
00:00:29.733 --> 00:00:30.500
All because of him

13
00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:31.433
Chu Minghua

14
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.566
Wake up, Linman

15
00:00:35.266 --> 00:00:38.400
Sister, I know I was wrong.

16
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.033
Of course I know it all

17
00:00:40.566 --> 00:00:42.466
Look at the girls on his computer

18
00:00:42.466 --> 00:00:45.800
You are one of them.

19
00:00:46.333 --> 00:00:48.966
How special do you think you are in his heart?

20
00:00:52.966 --> 00:00:54.866
You are nothing special

21
00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.100
Sister, I know I was wrong.

22
00:01:06.533 --> 00:01:07.333
Manman

23
00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.600
You are my sister

24
00:01:10.966 --> 00:01:13.166
I grew up watching you

25
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.866
I don't want to see you hurt in the slightest

26
00:01:17.066 --> 00:01:20.266
I hope you can find someone who truly loves you

27
00:01:20.533 --> 00:01:22.500
Live a happy life, okay?

28
00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.500
Sister, I know I was wrong.

29
00:01:28.566 --> 00:01:29.800
It's alright, take your time.

30
00:01:29.966 --> 00:01:31.100
You are still young

31
00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:32.233
It's not too late.

32
00:01:32.533 --> 00:01:34.066
Don't be like a sister

33
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.666
You must live a happy life, okay?

34
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.100
Come on.

35
00:01:47.166 --> 00:01:48.500
A feeling

36
00:01:48.733 --> 00:01:50.466
Choose who to be with

37
00:01:50.933 --> 00:01:52.766
The ending will be worlds apart

38
00:01:52.866 --> 00:01:54.700
Someone will be your light

39
00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:59.066
Some people will put out the light in your world

40
00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.700
I tried marriage for you

41
00:02:03.166 --> 00:02:04.666
People can be unhappy

42
00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.300
But you have to be conscious.
