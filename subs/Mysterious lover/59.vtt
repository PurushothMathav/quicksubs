00:00:04.066 --> 00:00:07.133
Manager, why are you here? Sister-in-law, you are back.

2
00:00:07.133 --> 00:00:08.700
I brought my brother the information

3
00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:11.066
What about your brother?

4
00:00:11.066 --> 00:00:12.333
Went to the port to pick up the goods.

5
00:00:12.333 --> 00:00:14.100
Isn't Yang Yi usually responsible?

6
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:15.566
Why did he go today

7
00:00:15.866 --> 00:00:18.600
Yang Yi, sister-in-law, let me tell you, you don't know

8
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.166
This Yang Yi dared to deliver goods in his company

9
00:00:21.166 --> 00:00:22.433
He carries private goods

10
00:00:23.066 --> 00:00:24.300
My brother knows about it

11
00:00:24.766 --> 00:00:26.233
He took the initiative to rob

12
00:00:26.533 --> 00:00:27.733
Entrainment of private goods

13
00:00:27.733 --> 00:00:30.600
Yeah, who would have thought that Yang Yi could do this?

14
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.566
Yang Yi is definitely not such a person

15
00:00:33.266 --> 00:00:34.600
When did you find out?

16
00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:35.733
Why didn't you tell me?

17
00:00:35.733 --> 00:00:36.700
Do your parents know?

18
00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:37.566
Hi sister-in-law

19
00:00:37.566 --> 00:00:39.666
Haven't you been in bad health all the time?

20
00:00:39.666 --> 00:00:41.600
And then your parents are getting older too

21
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.500
My brother doesn't want you to worry

22
00:00:43.866 --> 00:00:45.900
Then he gave it all to himself

23
00:00:46.533 --> 00:00:47.333
Mingming

24
00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:50.400
I didn't expect you to work so hard behind your back

25
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.266
What the hell did he say that for?

26
00:00:54.266 --> 00:00:55.900
I will send the information to my brother first.

27
00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:57.000
Gone, gone

28
00:00:59.133 --> 00:01:01.566
Chu Minghua has actually reached out his hand now

29
00:01:01.566 --> 00:01:02.566
Entered the nearby group

30
00:01:02.566 --> 00:01:03.833
Such a nice door

31
00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:05.466
He is a county doctor

32
00:01:05.466 --> 00:01:07.466
How can I understand so many things about doing business?

33
00:01:07.533 --> 00:01:09.966
Chu Mingli must be helping him deal with this.

34
00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:11.666
Hello Enron

35
00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.466
Accompany me to the port tomorrow
