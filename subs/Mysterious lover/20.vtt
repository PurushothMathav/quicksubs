00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:01.700
Oh, by the way, little nanny

2
00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:05.400
What's the matter with you being so anxious just now?

3
00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:11.266
Um, is there something urgent at home?

4
00:00:11.933 --> 00:00:13.366
Uh uh

5
00:00:13.366 --> 00:00:16.966
It's cheap if you don't care about things at home

6
00:00:16.966 --> 00:00:19.766
Hey Lin Xi, I have to talk about you

7
00:00:19.766 --> 00:00:21.333
This little nanny has something to do at home

8
00:00:21.333 --> 00:00:22.900
Why don't you let her go home?

9
00:00:23.566 --> 00:00:25.800
Enron, you really reminded me

10
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.000
Sister Xiao Nian, if there is an emergency at your home

11
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.466
Just go back and have a look.

12
00:00:29.466 --> 00:00:30.900
Don't delay.

13
00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:33.700
Madam said so

14
00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.266
Then you hurry back

15
00:00:35.333 --> 00:00:37.800
Ok then thanks ma'am

16
00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:38.900
Thank you, sir.

17
00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:40.100
I'll go back first.

18
00:00:41.333 --> 00:00:42.433
How come?

19
00:00:42.533 --> 00:00:44.300
Is there really a problem with the medicine?

20
00:00:44.766 --> 00:00:46.800
How did his spirits improve?

21
00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.300
Yo, it's getting late

22
00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:50.866
I'll go back first

23
00:00:52.266 --> 00:00:53.566
Didn't you just come?

24
00:00:53.666 --> 00:00:55.700
Why did you leave so soon?

25
00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:57.300
Oops husband

26
00:00:57.366 --> 00:00:59.733
It's too late to go back

27
00:00:59.733 --> 00:01:01.800
Enron, you should go back and rest early.

28
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.866
I'm so happy to see you

29
00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:05.500
Pay attention to safety

30
00:01:12.766 --> 00:01:13.566
Wife

31
00:01:15.333 --> 00:01:17.100
Am I thinking too much?

32
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.166
But really just look at the bleeding

33
00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.466
They don't know anything.

34
00:01:21.933 --> 00:01:25.433
Husband, although I have been sober a lot recently

35
00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.600
But I still feel tired

36
00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.366
Is it a side effect of this medicine?

37
00:01:29.366 --> 00:01:31.066
Since he's dying

38
00:01:31.066 --> 00:01:32.666
To allay his doubts

39
00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.266
If you want to stop him first

40
00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:37.533
Just enough to get him to tell those two old things

41
00:01:37.533 --> 00:01:39.200
Get what I want

42
00:01:39.333 --> 00:01:40.500
It's possible.

43
00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.500
If you feel better

44
00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.433
Otherwise, don't take this medicine.

45
00:01:46.733 --> 00:01:50.100
Taking too much medicine is not good for your health.

46
00:01:50.466 --> 00:01:52.200
What do you think?

47
00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.600
Listen to your wife so nice

48
00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.266
What is his conspiracy?

49
00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.066
Why did you suddenly stop taking the medicine on me?
