00:00:00.466 --> 00:00:01.466
Hello husband

2
00:00:01.466 --> 00:00:02.800
I'm out shopping.

3
00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:05.966
It happened to be near the port at home, so I came here for a walk

4
00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:07.300
OK

5
00:00:08.733 --> 00:00:10.900
You've been keeping a low profile lately

6
00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:13.266
Don't let him suspect you're investigating him so early

7
00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:18.233
By the way, Chu Ming, you can check it out. Okay.

8
00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:20.500
Hey Lin Xi

9
00:00:20.933 --> 00:00:23.300
I just saw a little girl take a guy out

10
00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.666
Chu Minghua is not afraid of getting any dirty diseases if he plays like this

11
00:00:27.666 --> 00:00:29.100
Bad guys have their day

12
00:00:29.133 --> 00:00:32.066
This scumbag, I'll get him out of the house sooner or later

13
00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:35.000
By the way, is there any news from Yang Yi?

14
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.833
Yang Yi

15
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.333
Yang Yi has no news yet.

16
00:00:38.333 --> 00:00:40.433
No one in his family knew he was missing

17
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.900
Yang Yi used to report safety to his family every week

18
00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:45.700
Missing for so long this time

19
00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:47.466
Doesn't his family doubt it?

20
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.200
That's the weird thing.

21
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.200
Yang Yi's messages reporting safety are all sent regularly.

22
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.266
So there was no suspicion in his family.

23
00:00:54.366 --> 00:00:55.566
send regularly

24
00:00:56.966 --> 00:00:59.666
Enron, I always have a bad feeling

25
00:00:59.666 --> 00:01:01.200
I always feel like something is wrong

26
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.166
But

27
00:01:02.166 --> 00:01:04.933
I have no evidence that Chu Minghua did it

28
00:01:04.933 --> 00:01:06.266
You have to trust Wen Hao

29
00:01:06.333 --> 00:01:08.266
Wen Hao will definitely find evidence

30
00:01:08.866 --> 00:01:11.300
Chu Mingli should also be particularly concerned about this matter

31
00:01:11.333 --> 00:01:12.500
It really was.

32
00:01:12.733 --> 00:01:15.500
Chu Mingli has always excluded dissidents for Chu Minghua

33
00:01:15.766 --> 00:01:17.800
And all the shady things

34
00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.466
It's all made by Chu Mingli

35
00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:20.933
Behind both of them

36
00:01:20.933 --> 00:01:23.000
There seems to be a bigger conspiracy

37
00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.666
Where else can you start?

38
00:01:29.766 --> 00:01:30.566
open
