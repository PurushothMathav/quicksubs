00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:03.666
sister

2
00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:07.500
Tell me honestly, sister

3
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:08.600
Explain what?

4
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:11.200
Can't I make my mom miss you?

5
00:00:11.266 --> 00:00:12.300
Just one day.

6
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.700
You will definitely make your parents angry and come out to avoid trouble

7
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:15.766
Go back tomorrow

8
00:00:15.966 --> 00:00:17.366
Hmm sister

9
00:00:17.366 --> 00:00:18.866
How about a week?

10
00:00:19.866 --> 00:00:22.933
I didn't even go on a graduation trip for a week

11
00:00:22.933 --> 00:00:26.200
Just wanted to visit you and Nini's sister

12
00:00:26.866 --> 00:00:28.566
The students are gone

13
00:00:28.733 --> 00:00:30.100
Just the one.

14
00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:31.700
Don't know where to go

15
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:33.666
Please, please.

16
00:00:33.666 --> 00:00:35.600
Just keep me for a few more days

17
00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.266
Okay, I really can't help you.

18
00:00:38.266 --> 00:00:40.500
But behave yourself at home

19
00:00:40.533 --> 00:00:42.233
How old are you?

20
00:00:42.266 --> 00:00:45.433
Why are you acting like a child? Eat it

21
00:00:52.066 --> 00:00:53.500
Oh, I'm thirsty.

22
00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:54.566
Pour me a glass of juice

23
00:00:54.566 --> 00:00:56.966
Ok, wait a minute.

24
00:00:57.133 --> 00:00:58.600
Grab another bag of chips by the way

25
00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.800
Original. Okay.

26
00:01:02.066 --> 00:01:04.233
Why did you come up with such persistence?

27
00:01:07.866 --> 00:01:10.400
Didn't you just hear me if I was original?

28
00:01:10.933 --> 00:01:12.600
This is the only one at home.

29
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.600
No, won't you buy it?

30
00:01:15.766 --> 00:01:18.033
Why are you standing here to buy?

31
00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.033
I never thought of that.

32
00:01:26.333 --> 00:01:27.933
My unruly sister

33
00:01:27.933 --> 00:01:29.833
And he gave me a bad breath
