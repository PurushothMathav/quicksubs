00:00:03.166 --> 00:00:04.866
Sir you are back

2
00:00:08.566 --> 00:00:09.733
Isn't this peaceful?

3
00:00:09.733 --> 00:00:10.866
When did it come?

4
00:00:11.066 --> 00:00:14.100
Husband, didn't you go on a business trip to see a patient?

5
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:15.566
Why are you back so early?

6
00:00:15.566 --> 00:00:16.566
Forget it.

7
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.566
As soon as I go out?

8
00:00:18.733 --> 00:00:20.166
Pull the information

9
00:00:20.166 --> 00:00:21.166
Look at my head.

10
00:00:21.766 --> 00:00:23.433
Old Enron

11
00:00:23.466 --> 00:00:27.400
You don't seem to have changed at all.

12
00:00:27.533 --> 00:00:28.866
Still so pretty

13
00:00:29.466 --> 00:00:30.266
Wife

14
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.566
Enron, why didn't you tell me?

15
00:00:33.566 --> 00:00:35.100
You see it's so hasty

16
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.666
The family is not prepared at all

17
00:00:37.266 --> 00:00:38.066
Xiao Nian

18
00:00:38.966 --> 00:00:41.900
Hurry up and cut some fresh fruit for the two ladies

19
00:00:43.166 --> 00:00:43.966
Hey

20
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:45.466
Wait a minute.

21
00:00:45.733 --> 00:00:46.866
Mr. Chu

22
00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:50.433
I said your nanny shelf is big enough

23
00:00:50.666 --> 00:00:53.733
I don't know, I thought he was the mistress of the house

24
00:00:53.733 --> 00:00:54.533
Oh.

25
00:00:55.266 --> 00:00:56.566
And this kind of thing

26
00:00:57.366 --> 00:00:59.200
Wei Xiaonian hurry up

27
00:00:59.533 --> 00:01:01.033
Apologize to Miss Aran

28
00:01:01.366 --> 00:01:02.166
Yes

29
00:01:02.666 --> 00:01:04.533
Miss Aran is my fault.

30
00:01:04.533 --> 00:01:05.466
Sorry.

31
00:01:06.066 --> 00:01:07.033
husband

32
00:01:07.766 --> 00:01:10.633
I miss my sister three times and four times and don't let Anran see me

33
00:01:10.866 --> 00:01:12.600
Did you know that?

34
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.366
Well, he's not entirely to blame.

35
00:01:17.666 --> 00:01:19.800
What about the wife before?

36
00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.400
Haven't you been in good health all the time?

37
00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.500
So let them claim it.

38
00:01:26.366 --> 00:01:28.066
Said you went abroad to recuperate

39
00:01:28.566 --> 00:01:31.300
Mainly not to worry parents

40
00:01:31.666 --> 00:01:35.533
Chu Minghua didn't expect your thoughts to be so true

41
00:01:35.533 --> 00:01:37.800
It should have been planned in advance

42
00:01:38.166 --> 00:01:39.633
Is that so?

43
00:01:39.733 --> 00:01:40.933
I misunderstood you

44
00:01:40.933 --> 00:01:41.833
You see

45
00:01:42.533 --> 00:01:44.766
Your little face is sick and thin

46
00:01:44.766 --> 00:01:45.900
Hey, okay, okay

47
00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.266
Stop showing your affection in front of me

48
00:01:48.266 --> 00:01:49.400
Oh, by the way, little nanny

49
00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.466
What's the matter with you being so anxious just now?
