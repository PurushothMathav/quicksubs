1
00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:08.200
These two beasts can't hold their farts together

2
00:00:08.333 --> 00:00:10.500
Conspiracy dog thing

3
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.066
They seem to be waiting for someone

4
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.900
What documents need to be secretly crossed outside?

5
00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:19.300
This document should be relevant to the next plan

6
00:00:20.333 --> 00:00:22.300
This beast seems to be going back to Lin Xi

7
00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:23.466
You have to go back quickly

8
00:00:25.533 --> 00:00:27.100
Lin Xi, it's getting late

9
00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:28.133
Or should I take you in?

10
00:00:28.133 --> 00:00:29.866
Just say I picked you up

11
00:00:29.866 --> 00:00:31.566
No, you can't expose it yet

12
00:00:31.566 --> 00:00:32.666
Chu Minghua is not stupid

13
00:00:32.666 --> 00:00:33.366
In that case

14
00:00:33.366 --> 00:00:35.666
He'll notice what happened at the hospital that day

15
00:00:35.766 --> 00:00:36.566
What to do then?

16
00:00:36.566 --> 00:00:38.266
I can't watch you die

17
00:00:38.266 --> 00:00:40.200
Don't worry, I'll adapt

18
00:00:40.366 --> 00:00:41.466
Just try it

19
00:00:41.466 --> 00:00:43.266
Does he dare to attack me at home?

20
00:00:43.266 --> 00:00:44.633
If you dare not

21
00:00:45.266 --> 00:00:46.766
Explain all his unfilial piety

22
00:00:49.866 --> 00:00:52.233
No, I can't put you at risk

23
00:00:52.533 --> 00:00:54.766
But if you don't even know his plan

24
00:00:54.766 --> 00:00:56.400
This is the most dangerous

25
00:00:56.466 --> 00:00:58.500
You'd better not have the idea of dying together

26
00:00:59.066 --> 00:01:00.233
You have children

27
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.866
Parents and us

28
00:01:03.066 --> 00:01:06.166
Yeah, you mustn't do anything stupid.

29
00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:08.666
So Wen Hao and I are near your house

30
00:01:08.666 --> 00:01:10.533
Send us a message if you're safe

31
00:01:10.533 --> 00:01:12.500
We only give you an hour.

32
00:01:12.666 --> 00:01:13.866
If you don't come out

33
00:01:13.866 --> 00:01:15.800
I'll go in and save you, don't worry.

34
00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.766
I promise you I will never take the risk

35
00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.800
If they find us

36
00:01:34.966 --> 00:01:36.266
Hurry up and find it for me

37
00:01:36.866 --> 00:01:37.966
Go!

38
00:01:43.566 --> 00:01:44.366
Sir?

39
00:01:48.666 --> 00:01:49.466
Missy

40
00:01:51.866 --> 00:01:53.500
Why did you get out?
