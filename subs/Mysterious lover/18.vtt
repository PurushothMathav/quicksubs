00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:01.600
Why is it you again?

2
00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:03.433
What about Lin Xi? I want to see Lin Xi.

3
00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:05.166
I've told you many times.

4
00:00:05.166 --> 00:00:06.600
Recovering illness abroad, not at home

5
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.533
You speak so quietly

6
00:00:08.533 --> 00:00:10.300
Shouldn't it be while the master is not at home?

7
00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:12.266
What are you doing?

8
00:00:12.266 --> 00:00:13.700
Lin Xi Lin Xi

9
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:17.100
Enron, let him in

10
00:00:27.566 --> 00:00:28.400
Enron

11
00:00:29.066 --> 00:00:31.533
Lin Xi, I have been here many times

12
00:00:31.533 --> 00:00:33.533
Your nanny keeps saying you're not there

13
00:00:33.533 --> 00:00:35.766
I don't know what's wrong with Ann

14
00:00:35.766 --> 00:00:38.866
An Ran quarreled and saw his wife, come back soon

15
00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:47.333
Ah, every time Miss Enron came before

16
00:00:47.333 --> 00:00:48.666
You are sleeping

17
00:00:48.866 --> 00:00:52.233
I didn't let her in because I was afraid it would affect your rest.

18
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.166
You are so kind to me.

19
00:00:55.933 --> 00:00:57.066
Come on.

20
00:00:59.166 --> 00:01:00.100
Oh yes ma'am

21
00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.366
Didn't you just say you were hungry?

22
00:01:02.366 --> 00:01:04.200
I'll go make you something to eat

23
00:01:04.266 --> 00:01:07.900
By the way, prepare for Miss Enron

24
00:01:08.366 --> 00:01:10.366
Who were you messaging just now?

25
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.366
Yes, sweetie

26
00:01:12.366 --> 00:01:14.100
Who are you messaging?

27
00:01:16.866 --> 00:01:19.366
Madam, I am

28
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:20.800
Enron is here
