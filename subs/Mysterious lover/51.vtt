00:00:15.533 --> 00:00:17.366
When are you going?

2
00:00:17.366 --> 00:00:18.933
I've only been here for a few days.

3
00:00:18.933 --> 00:00:21.566
Don't you miss me? I haven't said you yet.

4
00:00:21.966 --> 00:00:23.900
You ran away without saying a word

5
00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:25.100
What do you want?

6
00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:26.266
What do I want?

7
00:00:26.266 --> 00:00:28.066
I miss you, don't make a fuss

8
00:00:30.266 --> 00:00:31.566
Your sister is still there

9
00:00:32.333 --> 00:00:33.833
Let him find out

10
00:00:33.866 --> 00:00:35.166
It's not good for us

11
00:00:35.733 --> 00:00:37.000
Are you still afraid of my sister?

12
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.100
I can't see it.

13
00:00:39.966 --> 00:00:41.466
What do you mean?

14
00:00:41.866 --> 00:00:43.466
What do I mean?

15
00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.433
Mr. Chu is merciful

16
00:00:46.866 --> 00:00:49.066
Even the nanny at home

17
00:00:49.166 --> 00:00:51.566
What do you mean, Mom?

18
00:00:52.866 --> 00:00:54.100
You misunderstood.

19
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.266
He's just a babysitter.

20
00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.200
Why would I fall in love with him?

21
00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.333
Can I trust you?

22
00:01:01.333 --> 00:01:02.233
brother-in-law

23
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.666
Wait until I'm done with this time.

24
00:01:04.933 --> 00:01:06.200
I'll find you

25
00:01:07.166 --> 00:01:08.866
Hurry up and go home for me

26
00:01:09.966 --> 00:01:11.566
Then you say you love me

27
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.666
I said can you be obedient?

28
00:01:15.666 --> 00:01:17.500
Say you love me and I'll believe it

29
00:01:17.933 --> 00:01:19.633
You say you love me and I'll go
