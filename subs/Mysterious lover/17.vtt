00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:01.733
What's your name?

2
00:00:01.733 --> 00:00:03.966
Wen Hao doesn't know

3
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:04.933
The sound is wrong

4
00:00:04.933 --> 00:00:06.166
Enron asked me to give it to you.

5
00:00:06.166 --> 00:00:07.500
Feel free to contact us

6
00:00:07.766 --> 00:00:08.866
As long as you want

7
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.633
I'll take you out of here now

8
00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:12.100
No way.

9
00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:14.533
I have to stay here to save my family and children

10
00:00:14.533 --> 00:00:15.700
I can't leave yet

11
00:00:16.066 --> 00:00:18.100
Captain, get off the phone and I'll run

12
00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:18.800
We can't vote anymore

13
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:19.833
Let him in!

14
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.633
Your phone was tampered with.

15
00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.300
Use this number, it's all in it.

16
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:25.766
I'm going to pack up

17
00:00:25.933 --> 00:00:27.866
Call me if there is any danger

18
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.266
I'm nearby

19
00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:30.400
Hey

20
00:00:31.166 --> 00:00:33.400
Why is it so fragrant?

21
00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:34.866
I forgot to give him the medicine

22
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.733
Medicine

23
00:00:35.733 --> 00:00:39.366
Ah Yuan will come to my house tomorrow to help me take the medicine for inspection

24
00:00:59.066 --> 00:01:01.766
Madam, why are you awake? Wake him up.

25
00:01:04.866 --> 00:01:07.633
Fei Xiaonian, you didn't even prepare my meal

26
00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.266
What the hell are you up to?

27
00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:11.066
Ah ma'am

28
00:01:11.133 --> 00:01:13.600
If you're hungry, I'll make it for you now.

29
00:01:16.566 --> 00:01:17.800
Open the door first

30
00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:20.466
Yes

31
00:01:24.966 --> 00:01:26.200
Why is it you again?
