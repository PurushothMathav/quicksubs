00:00:29.766 --> 00:00:31.466
Hey, busy man.

2
00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:32.966
Why do you have time to see me?

3
00:00:32.966 --> 00:00:33.833
today

4
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.700
Help me find out what their relationship is

5
00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:41.733
Do you still need to watch these two?

6
00:00:41.733 --> 00:00:43.600
At first glance, it is his fight.

7
00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:45.800
Not the same as my relationship with you

8
00:00:46.066 --> 00:00:47.566
I already told you

9
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.333
Is he a good thing?

10
00:00:49.333 --> 00:00:51.800
What are you little, you just don't listen to me

11
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.400
He can't even spare you a nanny

12
00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.066
Do you think he will be idle?

13
00:00:56.066 --> 00:00:58.600
I told you to stop arguing, it's no use

14
00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.933
Just listen to me

15
00:00:59.933 --> 00:01:01.733
Hacked all his money

16
00:01:01.733 --> 00:01:03.800
In the future, when he withdraws money, you will put the money

17
00:01:04.166 --> 00:01:05.266
Take it all down for me

18
00:01:05.533 --> 00:01:08.033
I'll go with you when you have money

19
00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.933
And his money is all black money

20
00:01:09.933 --> 00:01:11.000
Without him

21
00:01:11.733 --> 00:01:14.833
He also used the future to make money

22
00:01:15.766 --> 00:01:17.166
Stop talking nonsense

23
00:01:18.966 --> 00:01:20.500
He couldn't have done this to me.

24
00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.700
There must be some misunderstanding

25
00:01:23.566 --> 00:01:25.500
Are you crazy?

26
00:01:25.533 --> 00:01:27.666
He's been using you, don't you know?

27
00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:29.700
Do you want to help me check?

28
00:01:29.733 --> 00:01:31.866
Don't help me check, I'll find someone else

29
00:01:31.866 --> 00:01:32.900
Sit down for me

30
00:01:34.066 --> 00:01:35.466
You have someone else

31
00:01:35.466 --> 00:01:38.400
Since elementary school, it has been forbidden for me to protect you.

32
00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.000
What are you doing? Do you take me for air?

33
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.400
Keep your voice down

34
00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.000
Let people hear
