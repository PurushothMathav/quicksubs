00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:03.560
Mom, why don't you see how much money he has in his name?

2
00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:04.760
How much can this be secured?

3
00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:05.740
How much is the mortgage?

4
00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.540
What kind of property can a water handyman have?

5
00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:12.200
I'm really stuck with cash at the moment.

6
00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.600
But I have a trolley downstairs that should be worth 500,000

7
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:15.740
You can drive away

8
00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:19.960
Hmph, what kind of capital turnover does a water pump say?

9
00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:21.460
There's a trolley downstairs

10
00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.340
Hmm, that's funny

11
00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.600
Hmph, I don't know what you look like

12
00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:27.960
You have a car?

13
00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.580
I still have a helicopter

14
00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:33.560
Do you have a car?

15
00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:35.160
A tractor at most

16
00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.220
Hahaha mom

17
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.340
Sis, what are you doing here?

18
00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.580
Isn't this the chairperson's office?

19
00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:44.900
Gao Shangyu

20
00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:47.060
What are you doing here?

21
00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:50.400
Hey, when are you working here?
