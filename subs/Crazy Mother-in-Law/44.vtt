1
00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:04.820
How much does the surgery cost?

2
00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:07.260
The patient's condition is urgent

3
00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.740
It will cost more than 300,000 in the early stage.

4
00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.220
300,000 where do I pay so much?

5
00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:20.700
Hurry up and raise money

6
00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.820
I'm going to check on the patient now.

7
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.700
How is the second sister's mother?

8
00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.700
I found that people need 300,000 for surgery

9
00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:39.840
I'm not in a hurry.

10
00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:40.760
Let's scrape together

11
00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.060
How much did you pay by car?

12
00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.480
I've been working for years and saved 60,000 yuan

13
00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:45.700
How much do you have there?

14
00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.100
Mom

15
00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.460
Your living expenses are all given by your mother

16
00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:52.300
I don't have that kind of money.

17
00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:57.140
How much Xi Shi do you have there?

18
00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.420
What are you looking at me for?

19
00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:03.680
I just invested in a bar

20
00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.766
How can there be money? Didn't you say yesterday that you still have tens of thousands of dollars at home?
