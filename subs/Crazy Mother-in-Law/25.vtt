00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:04.140
That's not right

2
00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:07.140
The mask will be with you tomorrow

3
00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:09.140
You still have to let me marry you

4
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:11.600
Ah

5
00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.700
You know I have the habit of getting up and waking up

6
00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:16.840
I can't wake up at that time

7
00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:18.400
You still have to let me in

8
00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:19.220
What do you mean

9
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.560
You have done something wrong to me, you are still reasonable

10
00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:23.880
If this gets out

11
00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.420
How can I meet people and marry people in the future

12
00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.740
Sister, we have been dependent on my mother since we were young

13
00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.300
Growing up like this, my mother didn't touch a finger of mine

14
00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.180
You actually hit me today

15
00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:38.580
I dare not want this family

16
00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:39.680
Humph

17
00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:41.240
Cut

18
00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:44.000
Get out of here

19
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.380
Unsatisfactory things

20
00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:46.820
Dream one dream one

21
00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:51.160
Dream one

22
00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.300
Dream one

23
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:54.500
You can't go

24
00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.440
My eldest girl's mental loss fee

25
00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.580
The second girl's mental loss fee is the least 200,000

26
00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:05.060
200,000 how do you count 200,000

27
00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:07.460
I'll tell you politely what you're yelling at

28
00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:08.860
Then 300,000
