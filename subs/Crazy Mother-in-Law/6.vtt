00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.300
If you break off the marriage, you must let him speak first

2
00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:06.720
What we said first

3
00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.060
What about the bride price?

4
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:09.300
Hello president

5
00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:11.880
The meeting this afternoon is about to start.

6
00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.180
Do you need me to drive over to pick you up now?

7
00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.920
Oh, the meeting is temporarily cancelled.

8
00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.540
I still have important things to do here

9
00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:20.620
Ok president

10
00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.260
Got it, Mom.

11
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.260
It was 200,000 dowry. He sold the house

12
00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.060
That is, how can we come up with 200,000 now?

13
00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.460
Don't you use it yourself?

14
00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:43.780
Come to my brother-in-law to drink water

15
00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:45.940
Thank you, Muyi

16
00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.160
It seems that your sister dislikes me

17
00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:53.240
Don't worry. It will be fine after you find a job. He will accept you then.

18
00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:54.380
Others are like that

19
00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:02.020
Muichi, get back in the house
