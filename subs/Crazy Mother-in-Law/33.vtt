Hello, can you tell me where the Human Resource Department is?

2
00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:10.340
Hello sister, thank you.

3
00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:20.960
Come in please.

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.080
Hello manager

5
00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:28.180
Here's my resume.

6
00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:29.500
I'm here to apply for a job.

7
00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:38.180
Are you Mengyi?

8
00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:39.960
Ah, right.

9
00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.260
What's wrong with me

10
00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.120
Ah it's alright

11
00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:45.640
Bachelor's degree, right?

12
00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.540
No previous work experience

13
00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:51.300
In this way, you can go to the promotion department for an internship first.

14
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:52.540
Come to work tomorrow

15
00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.880

I am

17
00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.220
The application was successful

18
00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:01.660
Yes, is there a problem?

19
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.260
Ah, no.

20
00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:08.300
I thought it would be difficult for such a big company to apply successfully
