1
00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.620
What did I lie to you about?

2
00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:02.960
I know it all

3
00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:04.560
You are the chairperson of this company

4
00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.140
How long do you want to lie to me?

5
00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:07.520
What about this?

6
00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:09.440
I didn't mean to hide it at first

7
00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:12.540
It's just that the world is cold now

8
00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:14.220
I had to do it too

9
00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:15.740
The world is hot and cold

10
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:16.800
brother-in-law

11
00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:19.100
Then there is no need to lie to me.

12
00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.660
I'm hiding this out of a bad policy

13
00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:26.200
But it also showed me the humanity of this society

14
00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:27.540
Isn't that nice?

15
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.440
Then you don't need to lie to me, do you?

16
00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:32.500
I hate it when people lie to me

17
00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.200
I'm not here to waste your time either.

18
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.920
Farewell to the chairperson

19
00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:38.260
Dream by Dream

20
00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:40.280
Dream one

21
00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.660
Wang Yi, listen to my explanation

22
00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:47.880
What's there to explain?

23
00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.920
Isn't it true that you lied to me?

24
00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.140
I told you to stop following me

25
00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.300
I really didn't mean to lie to you.
