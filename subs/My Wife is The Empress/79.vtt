00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.240
Presumptuous, are you questioning the identity of Her Royal Highness the Princess?

2
00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:04.700
Can't question it?

3
00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.620
Has anyone seen Princess Changle?

4
00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:09.380
Have you seen

5
00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:11.500
Or have you seen

6
00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:13.620
Have any of you seen

7
00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:19.540
Chang Le Ling is here

8
00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.620
I see who dares to question the identity of this princess

9
00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:25.460
This token is made of mysterious iron

10
00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:30.120
The patterns were all made by the court and high-ranking people

11
00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:31.640
Definitely Chang Le Ling

12
00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:32.440
Right

13
00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:33.740
This process

14
00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:35.060
This orange

15
00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:36.200
And this became the order

16
00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.720
It's all a fight, can't fight anymore

17
00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:39.600
The world will never find a second one

18
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.120
Isn't it just that you don't like your brother being the father of the third minister?

19
00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.000
I said that on purpose

20
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.580
Isn't this completely courting death?

21
00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.020
See how he suffers this time

22
00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.480
Now what else do you have to say?

23
00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.620
It's true

24
00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.100
Isn't this the token I lost?

25
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:55.640
Why is it in his hands?

26
00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.980
Now that you acknowledge the order

27
00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:01.520
Why don't you kneel down and greet this princess?

28
00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:02.600
Hand over the order

29
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:03.540
Can't kneel

30
00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:05.880
The token may be genuine

31
00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.340
But people are not necessarily real
