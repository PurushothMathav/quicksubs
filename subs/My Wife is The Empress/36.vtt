00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:06.340
This thing is two thousand-year-old wild ginseng in Changbai Mountain

2
00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:08.540
Changbai Mountain Millennium Wild Ginseng

3
00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:09.980
Two in a lifetime

4
00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:13.100
Even one is hard to find.

5
00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:16.180
A night pearl of meteorite diamonds

6
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.600
Ouch, this night pearl of meteorite diamonds is amazing.

7
00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.440
It is said that this is the only one in the world

8
00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:22.660
The person who got it

9
00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:24.660
Can you get lucky?

10
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.020
One jadeite cabbage

11
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:34.020
My God, this is more dazzling than the treasure of the town hall at the Mansion Museum

12
00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:38.980
A ruby

13
00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:40.600
This is too exaggerated

14
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:45.300
This is the eye of power that was once embedded in the scepter of the pharaoh

15
00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.860
Symbolizes supreme power

16
00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:53.300
Soul Pill is also available

17
00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:59.520
The single-meter-one adult who has the effect of bringing back the dead is really good.

18
00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.180
Even this kind of treasure is willing to take it out as a dowry

19
00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.180
Millennium ginseng

20
00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.820
Night Pearl Jade Cabbage

scepter gem

22
00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.820
These originally belonged to me, Gu Shichen

23
00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:16.620
God, what kind of wealth have I missed?

24
00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.240
These dowries are worldly treasures

25
00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.900
But not as valuable as all this. Wow.

26
00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:27.580
These already dowries

27
00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:29.660
It's been breathtaking.

28
00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:31.620
The last dowry

29
00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.940
Or what kind of existence?

30
00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:35.900
This known dowry

31
00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.660
Which one is put up for auction is a sky-high price.

32
00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:41.860
Isn't this last one going to be heaven-defying?

33
00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.940
But you need to open it yourself, Master Chen.

34
00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.260
Mr. Chen, please open it

35
00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:50.640
Husband

36
00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.060
I am a disabled person and do not deserve to be the father of the empress

37
00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.900
So this empress's order

38
00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:56.800
I can't help but
