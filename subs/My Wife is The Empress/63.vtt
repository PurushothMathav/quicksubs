1
00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:01.380
lord

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.280
Dare to despise my Bushido spirit

3
00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:05.700
So like me

4
00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.780
I see how you explain to the mansion lord

5
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.140
Are you really not afraid that I will help the three countries go to war?

6
00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:14.940
That's it.

7
00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:16.380
What are the consequences?

8
00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:19.220
I am the Chen family

9
00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:22.680
Are you just kneeling like that?

10
00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.780
How do you get married?

11
00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.300
This envoy cannot be humiliated

12
00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:29.820
You'll regret it later.

13
00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:33.100
I will report to the owner of the building for an explanation

14
00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:35.900
Then I'll give you an explanation

15
00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:41.260
First, you are like me, and you are like my husband when you start a family

16
00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:44.260
Those who dare to touch me will die

17
00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.220
Second, you are here to Chaogong Building

18
00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.900
How dare you dare to challenge the dignity of the Chen family

19
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.420
The following crimes will be committed against this

20
00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.640
Third, your prom friend can

21
00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.380
But challenge me to the majesty of Great Xia

22
00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.380
Your flag is too arrogant

23
00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.660
My Great Xia Emperor is vast and boundless

24
00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:06.860
But never mention the word river

25
00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.100
You have violated the taboo of the upper country

26
00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:10.260
Be guilty

27
00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.300
The last challenge is me, Ye Linheng, next

28
00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.100
But change the name

29
00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:17.580
Just call

30
00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:19.820
Great Xia Yanwu

31
00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.400
Exchange a big tone for the mystery of the great summer

32
00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.880
Can you afford Big Chapel on the prairie?

33
00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.600
I'm not consulting anyone.

34
00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.020
My rules are rules
