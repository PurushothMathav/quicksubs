1
00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:04.620
I want to fool the past by typing and scolding twice

2
00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.940
What I said at the Fengxi Banquet will not be repeated a second time

3
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.800
From today onwards

4
00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.420
There are no more two exiles in Qinzhou

5
00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:18.800
Miss Yue, please forgive me.

6
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:19.600
Miss Yue

7
00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:21.260
Beg me for mercy

8
00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.140
You don't think I'm soft-hearted.

9
00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.040
No no no not begging for mercy

10
00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:31.660
It's not me, my Wang family is willing to donate all the property of my Wang family to charity

11
00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:33.900
As for him

12
00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:38.820
Ah, do it yourself and use the frontier?

13
00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:39.720
shut up

14
00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:41.640
Ah, and me.

15
00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:42.560
And my Liu family

16
00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:45.560
My Liu family is willing to donate all their property

17
00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:46.900
Only this inverse

18
00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:48.700
I'll send it to the frontier.

19
00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:50.620
Serve your country

20
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:55.100
Dad, I don't want to go to the front line to kill you

21
00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.840
Aren't you curious about who Yan Ninghan is?

22
00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:58.980
I'll tell you what.

23
00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.380
He is the absolute protagonist of the Fengxi banquet

24
00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.360
The wife of Chen Dashao, a newly wealthy family in Shangjing City

25
00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.340
Even the female emperor was kind to him in the Qing Dynasty

26
00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.420
Your Wang Liu family did not go bankrupt with our Fang family

27
00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.480
That's because your boss knelt down and begged for mercy on Fengxin Ye

28
00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:18.940
Bitterly begged

29
00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:21.740
It's all right now.

30
00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.220
How is it worse than me?

31
00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:25.940
It's over.

32
00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:28.860
It's all over now

33
00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.620
Then do as you say

34
00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.640
Miss Xie Ye

35
00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.100
Thank you Miss Ye Thank you

36
00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:39.780
It's your turn.
