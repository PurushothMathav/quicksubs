1
00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.800
What 500 billion cash verification card?

2
00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:04.660
Are you sure there is no fraud?

3
00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:06.900
Dare to praise me

4
00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:10.100
I let your head fall to the ground General

5
00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:12.520
You know this auction

6
00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:14.500
Even if you lend me 10 heads

7
00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:17.900
I certainly wouldn't dare to lie.

8
00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.900
500 billion in cash is indeed real

9
00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:22.380
It belongs to the Imperial City Vault

10
00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:25.220
It's gold bars. 500 billion gold bars.

11
00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:28.660
Imperial City Vault

12
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:31.600
This 500 billion

13
00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:32.740
What's your situation?

14
00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:34.360
The process is not important

15
00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:35.820
It's the results that matter.

16
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.300
Now only the qualifications to buy out this auction are available

17
00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.560
Since no one questions

18
00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:44.980
So let's do it.

19
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.500
Bring Shenlongli over immediately

20
00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:52.580
Then send the 500 billion gold bars directly to the auction house according to the procedure

21
00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.780
It's my darling

22
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.360
When did you become so rich when you left?

23
00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.740
No matter how rich he is, he can be richer than Her Royal Highness

24
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.140
It may be that he used Chen Dashao to leave something else.

25
00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:05.360
That's right. That's right.

26
00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:06.400
That's definitely true.

27
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.360
Wait until your brother marries the princess and becomes the consort

28
00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.020
We are the royal family

29
00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.980
I'm on an equal footing with these big shots here

30
00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:40.780
Why is this so lively?

31
00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.580
Say jet lag and I'll kill you
