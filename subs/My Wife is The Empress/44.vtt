00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:01.420
lifesaving grace

2
00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:03.500
I keep it in my heart and I won't forget it.

3
00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:06.900
But not to love is not to love

4
00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:10.380
Have you really changed your mind?

5
00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:12.820
I can allow you to stand in front of me

6
00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:15.380
It is already the greatest tolerance for you.

7
00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:18.300
You can accept what I give you

8
00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.620
What I don't give you, you can't burn fat

9
00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.340
Make up never

10
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.880
Since he doesn't want you

11
00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:31.500
Then I'll issue a clearing order and allow you to be my dog

12
00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:35.260
No matter power or wealth, I can satisfy you

13
00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.700
I can even give you a wife

14
00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.480
The son of General Xia's favor

15
00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:43.920
That's something our Gu family can't ask for in eight lifetimes

16
00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:44.840
Promise

17
00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.520
Oh, brother, don't miss this village girl

18
00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:48.740
Promise him

19
00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.100
I don't know how true or false the words of the next commander are

20
00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.560
This prodigal son has just been established for not a minute

21
00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:58.420
You can't go too fast.

22
00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:01.580
Young Han, even if you are not the empress

23
00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.080
But you ruined my future

24
00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:04.640
I must have you

25
00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.660
We destroyed you with our own hands

26
00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:08.440
Sorry.

27
00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:09.860
I'm not a dog

28
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.920
Hmph, if you want to look up, you have to learn to bow your head first

29
00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.140
Don't you understand this?

30
00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.100
It seems that I look up to you

31
00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.340
You wait for today.

32
00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:28.860
Don't be afraid husband

33
00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.300
If anything happens, I'll protect you

34
00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:33.940
There we go.

35
00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:48.560
It's getting late.

36
00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.020
Why don't you stay here?

37
00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:55.700
No, I have something to do, I'll go first, hey
