WEBVTT

1
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:04.400
Wife

2
00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:09.300
I'm about to start the big joke in an hour

3
00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:11.500
Wait for me to come back

4
00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:13.420
In the evening we will have a wedding

5
00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:16.520
The wedding dress I chose yesterday was beautiful

6
00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:17.680
I'll try it for you tonight.

7
00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:18.500
Wife

8
00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.780
The person who took the gauntlet and me

9
00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:21.820
Let me go.

10
00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:26.060
Husband got on one, it's not a joke

11
00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.820
If I can't come back tonight

12
00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:33.520
You take the Deer God Order to find the Lord God

13
00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:34.780
He can fix your leg

14
00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:37.240
Wife is actually fine

15
00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:38.280
It's getting late.

16
00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.420
I should go.

17
00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.780
It's better to let him go than to let me go

18
00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.040
Ye Linhan plays against Daxia

19
00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:53.000
Yanwu subordinate

20
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.020
At that time, our entire Chen family will be sinners of only Daxia

21
00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.140
Yes, at that time, the name of the Chen family will be determined on the Department of Shame in History

22
00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.460
Shut up

23
00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:05.060
What about the gauntlet?

24
00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:07.140
It's Chen Bustill and Ye Linhan

25
00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.060
It can only be one of the two of them going to fight

26
00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:12.700
Don't let Ye Linhan go

27
00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.260
Could it be that Chen Bu will go back?

28
00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:17.460
Why not?

29
00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:18.600
Chen family majesty

30
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:19.740
You deserve my protection

31
00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:25.980
I am not only the master of the Chen family

32
00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.260
And your husband

33
00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:29.660
So I should protect it once

34
00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:31.700
This time the hero is drowned

35
00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.540
I'm coming, you're going to the ring

36
00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.560
How do you get into the ring?

37
00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.060
Climb up?

38
00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:40.860
Walking up, of course.

39
00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:51.860
Big eyes

40
00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:53.540
Can't lose
