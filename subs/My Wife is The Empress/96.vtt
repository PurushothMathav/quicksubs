00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:03.320
Miss Li is my dog's eye

2
00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:04.480
I know wrong

3
00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:06.680
Miss Li, please spare my life

4
00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:07.840
I am willing to keep my promise

5
00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:08.900
Hand over my store

6
00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:12.100
If he keeps his promise

7
00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.540
You can make a store of 30 million in vain

8
00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:18.380
You don't think I'm really going to help you regardless of the past

9
00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:20.980
Even if you do help me

10
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.740
I won't appreciate you a little either.

11
00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:26.020
Our Fang family's tens of billions of family assets were destroyed in your hands

12
00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:29.040
I will not forgive your Fang family

13
00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:31.620
The end is your own fault

14
00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.020
I just don't have as much background as you.

15
00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.120
Besides, you have to thank me

16
00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.400
If it weren't for me

17
00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.960
How can you see Gu Shisheng's instinctive face clearly?

18
00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.180
Then marry Mr. Chen?

19
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.220
You're right.

20
00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.660
Then you can hand over the store.

21
00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:53.160
OK, thank you Miss Ye

22
00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:53.960
You see

23
00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:55.600
This wedding dress

24
00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.180
I will find it and deliver it to your home.

25
00:00:58.720 --> 00:00:59.520
Hey, hello.

26
00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.740
If the Fang family makes a comeback one day

27
00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.420
I will still be your enemy

28
00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.500
Be my enemy

29
00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:06.980
Wash up and sleep

30
00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.460
My background is an abyss you can't imagine

31
00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:16.560
That Girl

32
00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:18.620
Who is it?
