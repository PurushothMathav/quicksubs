00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:05.166
What is this?

2
00:00:05.666 --> 00:00:07.200
Dragon goes to sea

3
00:00:07.366 --> 00:00:09.000
change your life against the sky

4
00:00:12.366 --> 00:00:14.033
With you, an unknown ancestor

5
00:00:14.466 --> 00:00:16.433
I'll see what you win against me

6
00:00:17.333 --> 00:00:20.266
I can solve thousands of troops by myself

7
00:00:24.666 --> 00:00:25.700
You lose.

8
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.433
From now on

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:32.066
700,000 square kilometers in Tiger Country are all downstairs

10
00:00:32.266 --> 00:00:35.600
Tiger King, you are already a kingdom slave

11
00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:37.000
Nonsense

12
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.000
Ben's psychic just played a game of chess with you

13
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.800
How could the country be destroyed?

14
00:00:42.166 --> 00:00:44.500
The psychic resurrection is dead

15
00:00:46.066 --> 00:00:47.233
How is that possible?

16
00:00:51.533 --> 00:00:52.333
you

17
00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:53.866
Who are you?

18
00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:56.033
The three-year deadline is too late

19
00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.833
You'll soon find out who I am

20
00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:01.200
Su Ya

Immediately find out the true identity of that man
