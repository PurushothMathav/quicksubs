1
00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.566
He actually pulled it out

2
00:00:06.566 --> 00:00:07.400
old man

3
00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:09.333
Long time no see.

4
00:00:09.333 --> 00:00:10.666
What happened just now?

5
00:00:10.666 --> 00:00:13.033
It hurts to death, he really pulled out the Eight Desolate Python Blade

6
00:00:13.066 --> 00:00:14.200
Is he a lobster?

7
00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:14.966
New Generation Tianjiao

8
00:00:14.966 --> 00:00:16.966
How is this possible?

9
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.466
He's just a piece of crap

10
00:00:18.466 --> 00:00:20.200
It's just coincidence.

11
00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.166
The Eight Desolate Python Blade reacted violently just now

12
00:00:22.266 --> 00:00:24.133
It means that Lord Long Shuai is coming

13
00:00:24.133 --> 00:00:25.566
The Eight Desolate Knives became loose as a result

14
00:00:25.566 --> 00:00:27.366
Will be pulled out by him

15
00:00:27.666 --> 00:00:30.500
I knew it, Linze, you're courting death

16
00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.400
Don't implicate us adults

17
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.133
If Long Shuai knows about this

18
00:00:34.133 --> 00:00:35.566
You're going to take it out on everybody.

19
00:00:35.566 --> 00:00:37.266
You'd better arrest him quickly

20
00:00:37.266 --> 00:00:39.466
Lin Ce's knife was allowed by Ben Hou

21
00:00:39.766 --> 00:00:41.866
If Tiandoulong Shuai blames it

22
00:00:41.866 --> 00:00:43.933
It will be borne by Ben Hou alone, my lord

23
00:00:43.933 --> 00:00:45.466
What a noble status you are

24
00:00:45.466 --> 00:00:48.300
But to take the blame for this kid who doesn't know how to live or die

25
00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.300
This can't be done, we don't agree

26
00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:51.966
Yes, no, no, no, no.

27
00:00:51.966 --> 00:00:54.800
You foolish women are truly hopeless

28
00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.466
I'll fend for myself

29
00:00:56.466 --> 00:00:58.000
Don't even beg for my protection

30
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.766
Nor do they deserve to enjoy my favor and leadership

31
00:01:01.166 --> 00:01:03.866
Do you want to listen to what you are saying?

32
00:01:03.933 --> 00:01:05.166
Which onion are you?

33
00:01:05.166 --> 00:01:06.500
And protect me

34
00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.066
How come I've never heard of it?

35
00:01:08.066 --> 00:01:10.200
There is still a god like you downstairs.

36
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.266
Hahaha, I'm dying of laughter.

37
00:01:12.266 --> 00:01:15.900
You can actually pull out the Eight Desolate Python Blade when you close your lips

38
00:01:16.666 --> 00:01:19.500
Then his identity is not announced by me

39
00:01:20.366 --> 00:01:22.100
Appointments in Lake Province

40
00:01:22.133 --> 00:01:24.366
And all quotas void

41
00:01:24.366 --> 00:01:26.700
Who do you think you are?

42
00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.366
I also want to revoke the interests that belong to us

43
00:01:28.366 --> 00:01:30.200
Just because Tiger Country was destroyed by me

44
00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:31.766
All about Tiger Country

45
00:01:31.766 --> 00:01:33.566
I have absolute distribution rights
