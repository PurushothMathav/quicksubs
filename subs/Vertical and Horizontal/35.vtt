00:00:03.566 --> 00:00:05.800
Baby, you really got it right.

2
00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:07.666
His incompetent cat bed

3
00:00:07.666 --> 00:00:09.266
I really don't even have combat power

4
00:00:09.266 --> 00:00:10.766
Is it really zero?

5
00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:13.700
Lin Tze, you trampled the dragon platform out

6
00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:16.566
It really is a rare waste material in a hundred years

7
00:00:16.666 --> 00:00:19.333
Citi month, this is what you said

8
00:00:19.333 --> 00:00:21.366
A man ten thousand times stronger than me?

9
00:00:21.366 --> 00:00:24.200
Dogs have better eyes than you

10
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.600
You surnamed Ling, it's okay to be ashamed yourself

11
00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.200
It also implicated my adults to become a laughing stock with you

12
00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:30.133
Now you are satisfied

13
00:00:30.133 --> 00:00:32.833
This kid actually has the face to stand on it

14
00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:34.033
I don't feel uncomfortable.

15
00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:35.200
If I were him

16
00:00:35.266 --> 00:00:37.066
I can't wait to find a crack in the ground to get in

17
00:00:37.066 --> 00:00:40.166
Hey, you see Longtan Mountain has a reaction.

18
00:00:43.366 --> 00:00:44.700
Only 1,000.

19
00:00:45.066 --> 00:00:47.300
Standing on it for half a day before 1,000 stops

20
00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:49.633
Is this the wine of waste wood?

21
00:00:51.866 --> 00:00:53.066
Ten thousand

22
00:00:53.166 --> 00:00:55.100
This kid is just like me

23
00:00:56.266 --> 00:00:57.600
Just 10,000 station

24
00:00:57.933 --> 00:00:59.233
What's the good view?

25
00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.200
No wonder you're still getting started.

26
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:05.466
It's actually on the same level as me

27
00:01:05.466 --> 00:01:06.900
So what?

28
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.900
It's not even close at all.

29
00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.066
Blue light is already very powerful

30
00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.833
Why doesn't this dragon fetus stop?

31
00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.533
How can this kid be mentally retarded?

32
00:01:19.533 --> 00:01:20.400
Power?

33
00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.500
This must be the broken Longtai.

34
00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.766
Impossible this is impossible

35
00:01:25.766 --> 00:01:26.966
An ant at the bottom

36
00:01:26.966 --> 00:01:28.500
How can I meet Ben Shang?

37
00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.000
This is seven feet weak for Benshon

38
00:01:31.366 --> 00:01:33.600
The battle bureau seems to be soaring up

39
00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:34.666
And what is this?

40
00:01:34.766 --> 00:01:36.566
Is he going to break through the million mark?

41
00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.066
Red light swallows mountains and rivers

42
00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:40.300
Blood

43
00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:41.333
Occupy millions

44
00:01:41.333 --> 00:01:43.900
There hasn't been a red light downstairs for a thousand years

45
00:01:43.966 --> 00:01:45.333
That's so amazing.

46
00:01:45.333 --> 00:01:46.500
Still not enough

47
00:01:46.733 --> 00:01:47.533
And so forth.

48
00:01:47.966 --> 00:01:51.033
Longtan doesn't seem to be stopping yet

49
00:01:52.533 --> 00:01:53.966
I've had my reward.

50
00:01:53.966 --> 00:01:54.666
God

51
00:01:54.666 --> 00:01:57.266
We have certified you and I want the nine-day dragon to be born.

52
00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.433
This is the last light

53
00:01:59.666 --> 00:02:01.033
Why are you still killing?

54
00:02:05.133 --> 00:02:06.566
Ah look look look

55
00:02:07.166 --> 00:02:11.100
Gaizhou's change of heaven makes nothing king

56
00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.200
Time has never seen
