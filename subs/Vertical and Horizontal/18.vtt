1
00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:04.300
Hou Feng Ming, we meet again

2
00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:05.366
How are you

3
00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:06.800
I say linzer

4
00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:08.766
Although you have realized

5
00:00:08.766 --> 00:00:09.733
The seriousness of the matter

6
00:00:09.733 --> 00:00:11.733
But what about you now?

7
00:00:11.733 --> 00:00:14.500
If you know you can't get off the stage, you can't either

8
00:00:15.066 --> 00:00:17.300
Shameless to such a world?

9
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.666
I also want to have a relationship with our phoenix monkey

10
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:21.633
You also deserve

11
00:00:22.333 --> 00:00:23.133
shut up

12
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.366
Mr. Lin, we finally meet Mr. Lin

13
00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:33.766
Did I hear it right?

14
00:00:33.966 --> 00:00:36.600
The phoenix monkey respectfully calls this kid sir

15
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.366
It seems that he and Lord Feng Ming not only know each other

16
00:00:39.366 --> 00:00:41.033
And the relationship loses money.

17
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.466
Lin Ce also knew Feng Minghou

18
00:00:44.733 --> 00:00:47.266
Impossible for someone like him

19
00:00:47.466 --> 00:00:48.866
How is it possible to make Fengming

20
00:00:48.866 --> 00:00:50.133
An adult of this level

21
00:00:50.133 --> 00:00:52.566
Mr. Lin, why are you up there?

22
00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:55.200
Did you open this Heaven Dou Skylark?

23
00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.100
That's right, this Skylark is me

24
00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.366
Look at these eight desolate sabers will also be dug out by me

25
00:01:01.366 --> 00:01:02.633
This lark gate

26
00:01:02.766 --> 00:01:05.066
Not only Lord Long Shuai can clear it up

27
00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.233
And he also plans to pull out the Eight Desolate Sabers

28
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.066
Is his true identity

29
00:01:10.666 --> 00:01:12.400
The answer is quite straightforward.

30
00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:13.400
Upon orders, Lord Hou

31
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.600
This person has confessed to the crime he committed

32
00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:18.200
Please also order ASAP.

33
00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.466
Arrest him immediately

34
00:01:19.466 --> 00:01:20.800
Dispose of according to law

35
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.200
Zhou Heng, do you know who you are arresting?

36
00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:27.766
Isn't he Skylark's watchdog?

37
00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.700
We were humiliated the other day.

38
00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.333
Throw him out the door

39
00:01:31.333 --> 00:01:32.600
He is remorseful

40
00:01:32.733 --> 00:01:34.566
Pretend now

41
00:01:34.566 --> 00:01:37.666
I want to regain my poor dignity

42
00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:39.766
You needn't pity him.

43
00:01:40.966 --> 00:01:42.433
Clean your mouth for me

44
00:01:42.766 --> 00:01:45.500
Tiger Country was defeated by my lobster that day

45
00:01:45.666 --> 00:01:47.800
Everyone thinks it's the monkey's credit

46
00:01:48.566 --> 00:01:50.800
And I want to be really clear here.

47
00:01:50.966 --> 00:01:52.900
Save me, the man of Longxia

48
00:01:52.966 --> 00:01:56.566
This gentleman, Linzer, who is officially standing behind me
