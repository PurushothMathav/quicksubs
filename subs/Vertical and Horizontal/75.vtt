00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.566
What does he mean by opening the country wide?

2
00:00:02.566 --> 00:00:05.300
Is Wang Chongyang still interesting?

3
00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:09.266
That's right, that person is Wang Bochuan, the eldest son of Wang Chongyang

4
00:00:09.266 --> 00:00:12.100
He was appointed to guard the Great Wall of the North under the Dragon

5
00:00:13.066 --> 00:00:15.000
Wang Chongyang just called him son.

6
00:00:15.066 --> 00:00:16.666
Release to Beijing Chengfang

7
00:00:16.666 --> 00:00:17.866
Lure foreign invaders

8
00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:20.100
What foreign enemy wants to invade the dragon

9
00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.033
We're downstairs from a civil war.

10
00:00:22.066 --> 00:00:24.233
How can you defend against foreign enemies now?

11
00:00:24.333 --> 00:00:25.366
Can't resist

12
00:00:25.366 --> 00:00:26.966
Then give up resistance

13
00:00:31.666 --> 00:00:32.766
Who are they?

14
00:00:32.766 --> 00:00:35.100
One is Akira Kitagawa, the god of war in Fuso

15
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.200
One is Brooke, the British director general

16
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.800
They were all foreign ambassadors.

17
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.166
Lobster people, listen up

18
00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:42.800
Your country has opened

19
00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.133
We contacted the outside world.

20
00:00:45.133 --> 00:00:46.966
Formed the Prosperity Coalition

21
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.800
The Nine Kingdoms of the Dragon Palace are about to march downstairs

22
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:50.733
You tremble.

23
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.166
You are united

24
00:00:56.166 --> 00:00:58.633
Did the lobster forget the old rules?

25
00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:00.800
So this time we want blood

26
00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.266
If you go to kill, you will not keep it at a fair price.
