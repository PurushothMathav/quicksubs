00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:01.300
I'm wondering

2
00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:03.933
You didn't show up when Wang Chongyang took the hostages

3
00:00:03.933 --> 00:00:06.333
You showed up when I took his man hostage

4
00:00:06.333 --> 00:00:07.600
Is it really such a coincidence?

5
00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:10.600
Wang Zongjun must have been forced to do this

6
00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:12.700
How can you be so kind as a junior?

7
00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:16.000
20 years ago, Wang Chongyang massacred me and the flower family

8
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.900
A total of 880 lives

9
00:00:18.133 --> 00:00:19.700
You call this a must-report

10
00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:21.000
The dead cannot come back to life

11
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.266
Besides, Wang Zongjun has always felt guilty for being true and good

12
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.066
Can't you just give him a chance?

13
00:00:25.066 --> 00:00:26.800
Dehumanized like him

14
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.633
Unscrupulous treason

15
00:00:29.933 --> 00:00:31.133
How could I feel guilty?

16
00:00:31.133 --> 00:00:31.733
and

17
00:00:31.733 --> 00:00:34.566
We are not qualified to replace our deceased predecessors

18
00:00:34.566 --> 00:00:35.866
Give Wang Chongyang a chance

19
00:00:35.866 --> 00:00:37.966
Enough who doesn't have a dark history

20
00:00:37.966 --> 00:00:39.066
Robberies are a thing of the past

21
00:00:39.066 --> 00:00:40.766
Let him apologize and it's over

22
00:00:41.366 --> 00:00:43.000
He actually dares to hit the ancient poem

23
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Is that Taishan Beidou under the dragon?

24
00:00:45.366 --> 00:00:46.166
Hit the imperial teacher in the face

25
00:00:46.166 --> 00:00:47.800
Isn't that the same as hitting the whole lobster in the face?

26
00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.266
This is the end, the bold thief dares to beat the imperial teacher

27
00:00:51.266 --> 00:00:52.100
What crime

28
00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.766
You dare to hit the remnant of my neighbor, you are against the sky

29
00:00:54.766 --> 00:00:56.400
Then won't it be over if I apologize?

30
00:00:56.566 --> 00:00:58.200
Even the Fuhrer wouldn't dare to hit me

31
00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:59.966
Do you think you want to cause trouble by apologizing?

32
00:00:59.966 --> 00:01:01.700
I just hit you.

33
00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:02.766
Didn't kill you

34
00:01:02.766 --> 00:01:04.233
You can't take it anymore

35
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.100
He, Wang Chongyang, slaughtered me and the Hua family

36
00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.933
880 living lives destroyed his hands

37
00:01:09.933 --> 00:01:13.466
If an apology works, what do you want this justice for?
