00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:01.800
What a shit general

2
00:00:01.966 --> 00:00:04.666
I think this is what you self-appointed

3
00:00:04.766 --> 00:00:06.100
As far as I know

4
00:00:06.866 --> 00:00:09.533
Heaven Dou God will have that lord dear

5
00:00:09.533 --> 00:00:11.066
God of the Hand

6
00:00:11.866 --> 00:00:13.466
Do you have any?

7
00:00:14.066 --> 00:00:15.333
I didn't hum.

8
00:00:15.333 --> 00:00:16.633
Just admit it.

9
00:00:16.733 --> 00:00:20.366
Second cousin took them all away

10
00:00:20.766 --> 00:00:23.700
God will make nature in Heaven Dou God General

11
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:26.266
Mr. Lin, look at what I do

12
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.833
I can't have a God-given heart

13
00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:30.266
You're courting death.

14
00:00:30.266 --> 00:00:32.500
Don't implicate my family, do you hear me?

15
00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.233
He admitted it himself

16
00:00:34.333 --> 00:00:37.033
What are you still defending for him, Hua Qiyue?

17
00:00:37.333 --> 00:00:38.700
You can think about it.

18
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.766
Especially that day on the Skylark

19
00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.566
I was there.

20
00:00:43.566 --> 00:00:46.300
Why didn't I know someone granted a decree from God?

21
00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.866
Hmph, really open your eyes and talk nonsense

22
00:00:52.666 --> 00:00:54.800
But this is the meaning of heaven

23
00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.800
That prayer thanks Mr. Lin

24
00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.300
Suya, bring the box up

25
00:01:06.366 --> 00:01:07.766
Oh, come on.

26
00:01:07.766 --> 00:01:09.700
I don't have time to talk to you

27
00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.033
Get him under me

28
00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.066
If you don't give me back
