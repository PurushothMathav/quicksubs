00:00:01.166 --> 00:00:04.066
Lin Ze has a smart nose

2
00:00:04.133 --> 00:00:06.466
Know that you are running for God here today

3
00:00:06.466 --> 00:00:09.166
So it smells like a pug and comes

4
00:00:09.166 --> 00:00:10.600
That is disgusting.

5
00:00:10.733 --> 00:00:12.400
Came here to campaign today

6
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.600
But they are all young leaders of lobsters

7
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.733
Even I have to take a step back sensibly

8
00:00:16.733 --> 00:00:18.266
You're the one looking at the door

9
00:00:18.266 --> 00:00:20.266
I'm sorry to come and join in the fun.

10
00:00:20.266 --> 00:00:22.466
Your brain was kicked by a donkey, right?

11
00:00:22.466 --> 00:00:25.133
It seems that the lesson I taught you last time was not heavy enough

12
00:00:25.133 --> 00:00:26.633
No long memory yet

13
00:00:27.166 --> 00:00:29.200
Do you really think of yourself as Long Shuai?

14
00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.066
Zhou Gongzi told me everything

15
00:00:31.133 --> 00:00:34.600
On the day of the lark, Lord Long Shuai was no longer stiff at all

16
00:00:34.666 --> 00:00:36.366
You openly impersonated him

17
00:00:36.366 --> 00:00:38.333
I don't think you'll live long

18
00:00:38.333 --> 00:00:40.633
Even if I really am what you think

19
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.833
I still don't take you seriously

20
00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:45.400
Still pretending, right?

21
00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:49.266
Somebody kick this nasty leather out of me

22
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:50.400
Zhou Heng

23
00:00:51.266 --> 00:00:53.700
Who gave you the right to be in this touching

24
00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:55.166
Lord Feng Named Hou

25
00:00:55.166 --> 00:00:55.800
God of Fighters

26
00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.500
The selection criteria for the general is that the capable are first

27
00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:59.966
It has nothing to do with identity

28
00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:03.266
What's more, Mr. Lin is still my noble

29
00:01:03.366 --> 00:01:05.366
If you dare him, isn't that equivalent to daring me?

30
00:01:05.366 --> 00:01:06.900
Ah, dare not!

31
00:01:09.333 --> 00:01:11.866
Wait for Uncle Zhuang to revoke your job

32
00:01:12.166 --> 00:01:14.900
I will ruin this woman's reputation

33
00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:16.800
Don't give me an apology to Mr. Lin

34
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.300
Why did he apologize?

35
00:01:24.866 --> 00:01:27.766
He seems to be the second young master of the Wang family

36
00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.166
The Wang family is one of the three clans under the dragon

37
00:01:30.166 --> 00:01:32.066
Second Young Master Wang is the leader of the new generation

38
00:01:32.066 --> 00:01:34.266
If even he comes to the election

39
00:01:34.266 --> 00:01:36.200
Then our chances are slim

40
00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.433
Long time no see Hua Qiyue

41
00:01:39.866 --> 00:01:41.800
I thought you were just like your appearance

42
00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:43.500
So clear and clean

43
00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.900
I didn't expect to keep this little white face behind my back

44
00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:49.800
I'm surprised.

45
00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:50.966
What are you saying?

46
00:01:50.966 --> 00:01:52.700
What are you faking?

47
00:01:52.733 --> 00:01:54.433
People are right here

48
00:01:54.566 --> 00:01:58.233
I'd like to see you guys

49
00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.066
What else to say
