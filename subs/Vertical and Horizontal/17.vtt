00:00:06.166 --> 00:00:07.766
Fengminghou Road

2
00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:18.466
Catch up with the dragon

3
00:00:18.466 --> 00:00:21.166
The highest-profile Skylark

4
00:00:21.166 --> 00:00:24.600
Linze, you're about to get into trouble

5
00:00:24.733 --> 00:00:26.566
Meet the Phoenix Monkey

6
00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.600
Meet the Phoenix Monkey

7
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:31.700
Zhou Heng

8
00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.966
Who allowed you to open the Skylark Gate without permission?

9
00:00:35.966 --> 00:00:37.666
When the wind rises, the lord will see clearly.

10
00:00:37.666 --> 00:00:40.366
We didn't open this lark door.

11
00:00:40.366 --> 00:00:41.666
It has nothing to do with us.

12
00:00:41.666 --> 00:00:43.033
That's right, my lord

13
00:00:43.266 --> 00:00:44.333
We are not qualified

14
00:00:44.333 --> 00:00:45.933
I don't have the ability to open the door.

15
00:00:45.933 --> 00:00:49.000
Zhou Xiaowei said that the doorman who opened the door was Long Shuai's doorman

16
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.166
I don't know if it's true or not

17
00:00:50.166 --> 00:00:52.300
Doorman

18
00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:53.900
That's the guy.

19
00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:56.166
He not only opened the lark gate without permission

20
00:00:56.166 --> 00:00:58.966
He still wants to pull out the Eight Desolate Python Blade

21
00:01:00.466 --> 00:01:03.633
Who dares to make trouble in Heaven Dou Skylark?

22
00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:06.033
Ordered to Huda Xino

23
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.966
This really has nothing to do with us.

24
00:01:07.966 --> 00:01:09.100
It's all this door

25
00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:10.466
He is the culprit

26
00:01:11.166 --> 00:01:13.166
It's all about this kid's lawlessness

27
00:01:13.166 --> 00:01:14.500
They didn't listen to us.

28
00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.400
If he really pulled out the Eight Wilderness Saber

29
00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.166
That is the national luck under the dragon

30
00:01:18.166 --> 00:01:19.666
He removed the majesty of Long Shuai

31
00:01:19.666 --> 00:01:20.633
Unforgivable

32
00:01:20.666 --> 00:01:22.633
Lord Fuminhou sent such a big message.

33
00:01:22.733 --> 00:01:25.066
Lin Ce is dead now

34
00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:26.833
I've never heard of it.

35
00:01:27.466 --> 00:01:28.866
Heaven Dou Dragon Shuai

36
00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:31.366
And a doorman.

37
00:01:32.166 --> 00:01:34.400
Who are you? Turn around

38
00:01:37.133 --> 00:01:40.000
Feng Minghong, we meet again

39
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.166
How are you
