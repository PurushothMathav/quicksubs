00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:05.666
When did Xuanxuan's leukemia happen?

2
00:00:05.866 --> 00:00:07.800
Not long after you left

3
00:00:10.966 --> 00:00:12.800
How is the doctor child?

4
00:00:12.866 --> 00:00:13.866
The patient is in urgent condition

5
00:00:13.866 --> 00:00:14.866
Urgent need to write

6
00:00:14.933 --> 00:00:16.100
Which of you is a relative of the patient?

7
00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:19.233
I am, but our blood types don't match.

8
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.966
Doctor, can you help me test it too?

9
00:00:21.966 --> 00:00:23.633
If the blood type matches

10
00:00:23.766 --> 00:00:24.966
Give the child a blood transfusion immediately

11
00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:31.333
Yanni, I see he cares so much

12
00:00:31.333 --> 00:00:33.966
Xuan Xuan must also care about you

13
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.966
Why don't we make nice to him?

14
00:00:37.166 --> 00:00:40.166
Well, maybe you can remarry

15
00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.433
Once you remarry

16
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.300
Our Sun family will rise to the sky in one step

17
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.833
Oh, Mom.

18
00:00:47.866 --> 00:00:50.666
Do you still want to live a hard life like this?

19
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.700
You hurry up, go

20
00:00:55.966 --> 00:00:57.200
My child and I are destined

21
00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:58.833
blood type matching

22
00:00:59.333 --> 00:01:00.566
Temporarily no love

23
00:01:01.266 --> 00:01:03.666
Linze, I want to have a word with you

24
00:01:04.266 --> 00:01:05.166
I have something else to do

25
00:01:05.166 --> 00:01:08.000
Go first, Lin Cuo

26
00:01:08.266 --> 00:01:10.066
I regretted it.

27
00:01:10.166 --> 00:01:11.900
From the day of the festival

28
00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:13.833
I think of you every day

29
00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.666
I think of you all the time

30
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.600
Sun Yani, let me ask you

31
00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:23.766
For you

32
00:01:23.866 --> 00:01:25.666
It is my identity as Long Shuai that is important

33
00:01:26.366 --> 00:01:27.866
Or am I more important?

34
00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.000
Does it matter?

35
00:01:31.866 --> 00:01:33.066
It doesn't matter

36
00:01:33.566 --> 00:01:36.300
You're just a vain, shallow woman
