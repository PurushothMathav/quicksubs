00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.066
No, they're not qualified.

2
00:00:02.066 --> 00:00:03.200
What is your identity?

3
00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:04.500
What is our status?

4
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.000
Why do you say we are not qualified?

5
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.366
Is if

6
00:00:07.366 --> 00:00:08.933
What grade is the Eight Wilderness quilt?

7
00:00:08.933 --> 00:00:10.500
Pull out the person who can't be picked up

8
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.200
Then isn't it a joke that we are downstairs?

9
00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.600
If the Eight Wilderness is pulled out by Mr. Lin

10
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.266
Then you are the joke

11
00:00:16.266 --> 00:00:20.066
Everyone is equal, regardless of birth or poverty.

12
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.466
The so-called proud son of heaven

13
00:00:21.466 --> 00:00:23.000
Just don't want the world to fall

14
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.400
A man who does his best to break the shackles of fate

15
00:00:26.766 --> 00:00:28.166
Just words

16
00:00:28.333 --> 00:00:30.900
It's not all relying on Lord Fengming Monkey to protect you

17
00:00:30.933 --> 00:00:34.033
Otherwise, I don't have your say, shut up

18
00:00:35.533 --> 00:00:38.500
Mr. Lin, if you want to go up and draw a knife

19
00:00:38.533 --> 00:00:39.800
I support you.

20
00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:41.766
But you have to be careful.

21
00:00:41.766 --> 00:00:43.433
No, you can't.

22
00:00:43.866 --> 00:00:44.666
Zhou Heng

23
00:00:45.133 --> 00:00:46.500
You are incompetent

24
00:00:46.933 --> 00:00:48.500
Don't you give others a chance?

25
00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.433
Sir, today is the Lark restart.

26
00:00:51.466 --> 00:00:53.033
The day Long Shuai came out of the mountain

27
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:54.733
Don't let

28
00:00:54.733 --> 00:00:56.633
This one continues to pull out the Eight Wilderness Fierce Sword

29
00:00:56.733 --> 00:00:58.633
If you let Lord Long Shuai know

30
00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:00.266
Will not forgive us lightly

31
00:01:00.266 --> 00:01:02.233
That's right, these Eight Desolate Swords

32
00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.500
It is the intention of Long Shuai to go out of the mountain

33
00:01:04.933 --> 00:01:05.733
If so

34
00:01:05.733 --> 00:01:07.500
I can't let this kid burn fat

35
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.466
Otherwise it will implicate us

36
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.600
Lord Fengming Hou

37
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.500
You also don't want to be because of a small role

38
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.700
And let us downstairs give the Heaven Dou Legion

39
00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.600
Does it leave a bad impression?

40
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.066
Mr. Lin, this is really long-winded.

41
00:01:22.166 --> 00:01:24.033
When will I draw my own knife?

42
00:01:24.166 --> 00:01:26.066
Also with your permission

43
00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.833
What, Mr. Lin?

44
00:01:28.066 --> 00:01:29.800
You said the knife was yours
