00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:01.166
Lord Baisha

2
00:00:01.166 --> 00:00:03.233
Our legion has been captured

3
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:04.333
Are you kidding me?

4
00:00:04.333 --> 00:00:05.533
We 50,000 many people

5
00:00:05.533 --> 00:00:07.566
Even a single spit can drown them

6
00:00:07.566 --> 00:00:08.766
How could he have been captured?

7
00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:10.300
bag

8
00:00:10.933 --> 00:00:12.533
Report that the South Gate of the General Army has fallen Report

9
00:00:12.533 --> 00:00:13.733
The North Gate of the General Army also fell

10
00:00:13.733 --> 00:00:16.266
How can this be?

11
00:00:16.733 --> 00:00:18.000
Hundreds of thousands of troops

12
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.700
How could he be defeated by these mortals?

13
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:23.100
Impossible Absolutely impossible Wang Chongyang

14
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.500
You're gone now.

15
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.633
It's time to send you on your way

16
00:00:28.366 --> 00:00:29.566
Who are you?

17
00:00:29.766 --> 00:00:31.133
I don't kill nobody.

18
00:00:31.133 --> 00:00:33.300
We are black and white

19
00:00:33.366 --> 00:00:34.600
Black and white double play

20
00:00:34.766 --> 00:00:37.266
It is the top ten powerhouses on the global killer list

21
00:00:37.266 --> 00:00:39.466
Rumor has it that the two worked together to achieve a miracle

22
00:00:39.466 --> 00:00:41.800
Even in the face of Tian Doulong Shuai, he definitely doesn't need it

23
00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:42.566
It's over.

24
00:00:42.566 --> 00:00:45.800
The one for me is doomed.

25
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:47.800
I didn't expect the neighbor's remnant

26
00:00:47.933 --> 00:00:49.400
I have a killer risk underneath

27
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:50.900
It turned out to be a black and white double evil

28
00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.733
As a martial arts practitioner, he actually climbs his fists and has power

29
00:00:53.733 --> 00:00:56.166
And pretend to be a hero for treason

30
00:00:56.366 --> 00:00:59.000
Damn it's coming

31
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.600
How dare you retire and kill him for me?

32
00:01:02.133 --> 00:01:02.933
Hey

33
00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:07.600
How is that possible?

34
00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.466
This nervous powerhouse was actually killed by a knife

35
00:01:09.466 --> 00:01:10.566
Is he blaming me?

36
00:01:10.733 --> 00:01:12.833
Wang Chongyang has a long life
