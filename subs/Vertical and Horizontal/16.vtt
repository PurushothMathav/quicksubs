00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:01.600
What are you doing up there?

2
00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:02.400
Don't roll down

3
00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:05.100
Well, he's not really pretentious.

4
00:00:05.133 --> 00:00:06.933
Think you are the new generation of pride

5
00:00:06.933 --> 00:00:08.466
He turned on Skylark earlier

6
00:00:08.466 --> 00:00:10.466
If I really pull out the Eight Desolate Sword this time

7
00:00:10.466 --> 00:00:11.600
That means he is

8
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:15.166
Don't worry, Patriarch Zhao was only lucky before

9
00:00:15.533 --> 00:00:18.333
But this knife can't even be pulled out by Duke Zhou

10
00:00:18.333 --> 00:00:22.066
He's just embarrassing to come up here, boy

11
00:00:22.333 --> 00:00:23.866
What is your identity?

12
00:00:24.366 --> 00:00:26.800
Also equipped with igniting the Eight Wilderness Saber

13
00:00:27.533 --> 00:00:28.800
Heaven Dou majesty

14
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.100
Incorruptible

15
00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:32.933
This Eight Desolate Python Blade has stood here for three years

16
00:00:32.933 --> 00:00:35.133
And I went into hiding for three years.

17
00:00:35.133 --> 00:00:37.166
I didn't expect this knife to be still sharp

18
00:00:37.166 --> 00:00:39.266
And I can still stand out from the crowd

19
00:00:39.666 --> 00:00:41.133
Fart against the sky

20
00:00:41.133 --> 00:00:42.733
The boy is relying on bragging

21
00:00:42.733 --> 00:00:44.800
If you don't commit a capital crime, just blow into the sky

22
00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.366
Linze, stop being stupid

23
00:00:47.366 --> 00:00:50.200
Blood Poison Eight Desolate Python Sword is equivalent to contempt for Heaven Dou

24
00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.166
You can't afford the consequences of this

25
00:00:53.333 --> 00:00:55.200
If you really dare to draw a knife

26
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.166
Committed a heinous crime

27
00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:58.466
When the wind comes up

28
00:00:58.466 --> 00:01:01.433
You'll end up dead

29
00:01:02.066 --> 00:01:04.166
If Tian Doulong leads the general

30
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.133
You have to have nine legs.

31
00:01:07.133 --> 00:01:09.200
Don't you understand by now?

32
00:01:09.533 --> 00:01:11.566
Open the lark and rise to the eight wilderness

33
00:01:11.566 --> 00:01:12.766
No matter who

34
00:01:12.766 --> 00:01:15.066
Will worship me as king
