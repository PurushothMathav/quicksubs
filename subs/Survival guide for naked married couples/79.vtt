00:00:00.533 --> 00:00:02.100
Blessed are the vast majority of his funds

2
00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:04.266
All on 1314 stock

3
00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:06.066
So of course we also sell 1314.

4
00:00:06.066 --> 00:00:08.000
I have transferred 2 billion into your account.

5
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.133
You transfer all the liquidity of An's

6
00:00:10.133 --> 00:00:11.533
I'm not afraid that I'll lose my money

7
00:00:11.533 --> 00:00:13.333
Has your company fallen into a debt crisis?

8
00:00:13.333 --> 00:00:14.566
Let's do it

9
00:00:16.066 --> 00:00:17.700
Let's invest more than ten billion in it first

10
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:19.266
Let the stock price go crazy

11
00:00:19.266 --> 00:00:20.900
Then we start to evaluate the position

12
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.933
Then the stock price will go crazy

13
00:00:23.933 --> 00:00:25.866
Wow, you're going to let Yofu

14
00:00:25.866 --> 00:00:27.800
Spit up everything he's eaten all these years

15
00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.933
It seems that Yufu and his silly son

16
00:00:29.933 --> 00:00:32.000
I won't be able to sleep tonight.

17
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Let me tell you something.

18
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.700
Not only do I keep them awake

19
00:00:34.733 --> 00:00:36.666
I'm going to make them blast

20
00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:40.900
Mom is bad

21
00:00:41.066 --> 00:00:43.033
1314 stocks fell by the limit

22
00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:44.033
What!

23
00:00:44.933 --> 00:00:46.033
Go on like this

24
00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.266
Our May Day will be gone soon.

25
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.766
What are you panicking about, you useless thing?

26
00:00:50.766 --> 00:00:52.433
I will transfer 1 billion to you immediately.

27
00:00:52.566 --> 00:00:54.400
You continue to invest in 1314

28
00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.533
Pull up the stock price

29
00:00:55.533 --> 00:00:57.433
We can't let 500 million lose

30
00:00:57.566 --> 00:00:59.066
Good, very good.

31
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.066
They're already on it.

32
00:01:00.066 --> 00:01:01.900
Looks like Yves has taken the bait

33
00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:03.500
I'm going to invest a few more billion.

34
00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.366
Very good, I also bought the 1314 stock immediately

35
00:01:06.366 --> 00:01:07.166
Let's go together

36
00:01:07.166 --> 00:01:08.700
Let Yuv die faster

37
00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.666
Mom, the other party is also pulling the skeleton.

38
00:01:14.166 --> 00:01:17.533
Weird, I thought they were going to smash it

39
00:01:17.533 --> 00:01:19.966
Looks like someone is trying to mess with us

40
00:01:21.366 --> 00:01:22.566
Go on like this

41
00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.800
Our billion will be gone soon.

42
00:01:25.166 --> 00:01:27.266
I am a major shareholder of Youshi

43
00:01:27.266 --> 00:01:30.366
Which unknowing guy dares to compare money with me

44
00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.200
I will transfer another 1 billion to you immediately.

45
00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.533
No matter what, hold on for another hour

46
00:01:34.533 --> 00:01:35.900
Retouch after an hour

47
00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:37.233
We'll talk about it when it opens tomorrow.
