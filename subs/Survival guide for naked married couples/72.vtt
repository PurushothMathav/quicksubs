00:00:09.133 --> 00:00:09.933
grandma

2
00:00:10.366 --> 00:00:11.966
Please talk to grandpa

3
00:00:11.966 --> 00:00:14.366
Grandma, what do you usually call Grandpa You?

4
00:00:14.366 --> 00:00:16.966
What do you call him now? Can he hear Lao You?

5
00:00:16.966 --> 00:00:17.966
I am the new moon

6
00:00:17.966 --> 00:00:19.366
Open your eyes and look at me

7
00:00:19.366 --> 00:00:21.766
Didn't you say before that as long as you hear my name

8
00:00:21.766 --> 00:00:23.166
Immediately full of energy

9
00:00:23.166 --> 00:00:24.866
You say I look best in red

10
00:00:24.866 --> 00:00:26.800
Open your eyes and look at me

11
00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:28.800
Old demon old demon

12
00:00:29.966 --> 00:00:31.000
Ouch.

13
00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:33.900
grandma

14
00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:38.866
I've only been leaving for a few days.

15
00:00:38.966 --> 00:00:41.200
This house is as messy as a thief

16
00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:42.500
The electricity is not charged

17
00:00:42.533 --> 00:00:45.000
I don't know how you've been doing these days

18
00:00:45.366 --> 00:00:47.833
I don't know how I live these days

19
00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:49.666
But all I know is

20
00:00:50.266 --> 00:00:51.600
During your absence

21
00:00:52.133 --> 00:00:53.466
I was dead.

22
00:00:53.466 --> 00:00:54.366
Sorry.

23
00:00:54.366 --> 00:00:56.300
You shouldn't be left alone at home

24
00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:57.400
You promise me

25
00:00:57.666 --> 00:00:59.166
No matter what happens in the future

26
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:00.900
Let's not separate, okay?

27
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:02.000
I promise you.

28
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.466
You don't know when I went to deliver grandma today

29
00:01:04.466 --> 00:01:06.566
He wouldn't wait for a traffic light.

30
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.433
He cried and said he had waited his whole life

31
00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.066
And I was thinking.

32
00:01:11.066 --> 00:01:13.666
People can't afford to wait much in this life

33
00:01:14.066 --> 00:01:15.600
Not even for a minute

34
00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:16.666
And you know what?

35
00:01:16.766 --> 00:01:19.100
After you left, I waited for you every day.

36
00:01:19.666 --> 00:01:21.400
As long as a century

37
00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.133
We should cherish the present

38
00:01:23.133 --> 00:01:24.900
Cherish every minute we spend together

39
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.333
Carry out our love and marriage to the end

40
00:01:27.333 --> 00:01:28.766
Except for life and death

41
00:01:29.066 --> 00:01:31.900
Nothing can separate us
