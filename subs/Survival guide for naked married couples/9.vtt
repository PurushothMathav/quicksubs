00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:04.266
Didn't the old lady and the old man not accept him?

2
00:00:04.266 --> 00:00:06.233
Why did you suddenly ask to see him?

3
00:00:06.366 --> 00:00:08.000
There must be something wrong here

4
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.633
What kind of medicine does the old man sell in this gourd?

5
00:00:11.966 --> 00:00:13.766
From what I know about the old lady

6
00:00:13.766 --> 00:00:16.100
He must want your delivery guy husband

7
00:00:16.133 --> 00:00:17.500
Retreat

8
00:00:18.366 --> 00:00:20.433
The old man held back his anger

9
00:00:20.666 --> 00:00:22.500
What good is there to see him?

10
00:00:22.766 --> 00:00:25.600
Do you think the old lady can accept him?

11
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:26.766
conservative estimate

12
00:00:26.966 --> 00:00:28.533
You have to go back with the kids too

13
00:00:28.533 --> 00:00:31.200
Deliberately fell under his feet for three days and three nights

14
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:32.166
Only possible

15
00:00:32.966 --> 00:00:34.833
Brother, I think

16
00:00:35.066 --> 00:00:38.400
You and your sister-in-law should hurry up and make people

17
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:39.933
So we're all married?

18
00:00:39.933 --> 00:00:41.000
Not even parents

19
00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.300
I can't say it, then

20
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.333
Is it reliable? Don't worry.

21
00:00:46.333 --> 00:00:48.400
I'm sure I'll pick the two best actors for you

22
00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.366
Old actor handle

23
00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.366
A best-in-class performance

24
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.800
Guaranteed to be foolproof
