00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.666
Liu July is your father, you still don't admit it, do you?

2
00:00:02.666 --> 00:00:03.966
This is what you forced me to do

3
00:00:03.966 --> 00:00:05.166
And your grandfather

4
00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:06.866
He used to be partial to your dad

5
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.833
Now there is eccentricity, what have you given you to wander the world?

6
00:00:10.333 --> 00:00:11.533
You said my grandpa was partial to me

7
00:00:11.533 --> 00:00:13.200
You know my parents used to travel the world

8
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.500
How much effort did it take?

9
00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:16.700
And the foundation I have laid for traveling the world over the years

10
00:00:16.733 --> 00:00:17.900
It's there for all to see.

11
00:00:17.933 --> 00:00:20.133
So Youshi wasn't given to us by grandpa

12
00:00:20.133 --> 00:00:22.400
We created them ourselves.

13
00:00:23.266 --> 00:00:24.466
You ask yourselves.

14
00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:26.100
What have you done for the Warriors?

15
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:27.400
What right do you have to tell me

16
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:28.800
How thick-skinned you are!

17
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.733
Not only do you love to grab things that don't belong to you

18
00:00:30.733 --> 00:00:32.200
Still robbing so righteously

19
00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.566
It seems that you are as pampered as your son

20
00:00:34.566 --> 00:00:35.533
Jiaozong is used to it

21
00:00:35.533 --> 00:00:36.766
Let your greed grow

22
00:00:36.766 --> 00:00:38.000
Feel superior

23
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.600
Everything should be yours

24
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.366
But I can't see Ming Xuan and Ming Xuan at all

25
00:00:41.366 --> 00:00:42.766
Parents' ability and dedication

26
00:00:42.766 --> 00:00:44.866
To put it bluntly, you are stupid

27
00:00:44.866 --> 00:00:46.066
Your aunt

28
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.533
Take something that doesn't belong to you

29
00:00:48.533 --> 00:00:49.966
Sooner or later you have to pay it back

30
00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.466
Just like you went to great lengths to take away the warriors

31
00:00:52.466 --> 00:00:55.233
I got it back in my own right.

32
00:00:55.666 --> 00:00:58.233
I have already recorded what I said just now.

33
00:00:58.966 --> 00:01:01.366
Just wait for the law to punish you.

34
00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:05.566
Ahhh

35
00:01:06.333 --> 00:01:08.100
Ah let's go
