00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:11.700
Husband look

2
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:12.866
It's the anti-positive couple

3
00:00:12.866 --> 00:00:14.566
What does the anti-positive couple mean?

4
00:00:14.866 --> 00:00:16.700
The last time they were married

5
00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:18.500
The movement is so loud

6
00:00:18.566 --> 00:00:20.466
Almost demolished the house

7
00:00:20.766 --> 00:00:23.133
It was all over the neighborhood.

8
00:00:23.133 --> 00:00:25.700
Everyone calls them the Fangzheng couple

9
00:00:29.566 --> 00:00:30.666
They're so sweet!

10
00:00:30.666 --> 00:00:32.700
Can we be like them?

11
00:00:39.333 --> 00:00:41.900
Oops, I want, I want, what's wrong with me?

12
00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:42.933
What's wrong with husband

13
00:00:42.933 --> 00:00:43.733
Humph

14
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.400
How can we be like them?

15
00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:46.433
You have to lose weight.

16
00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:47.566
You are fat

17
00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:50.600
They look like Latin to me.

18
00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.400
If I could be young again

19
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.800
I also want to have a relationship like them
