00:00:02.966 --> 00:00:04.000
This is our home.

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:04.966
You are not at home

3
00:00:04.966 --> 00:00:05.900
Where do you intend to go?

4
00:00:05.966 --> 00:00:06.866
I go home

5
00:00:06.866 --> 00:00:09.600
Why am I just so confused right now?

6
00:00:09.766 --> 00:00:10.800
I want to be alone

7
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.466
So what's the result of being quiet?

8
00:00:12.466 --> 00:00:13.166
Divorced?

9
00:00:13.166 --> 00:00:16.033
Didn't you say who filed for divorce and who was struck by lightning?

10
00:00:16.333 --> 00:00:18.966
I'm afraid just because I'm afraid?

11
00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:19.966
I just don't know.

12
00:00:19.966 --> 00:00:22.500
Why are there so many problems between us?

13
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.500
So I just want to be alone

14
00:00:24.733 --> 00:00:26.833
But you make me feel like I'm panicking

15
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.766
I'm afraid of Mingxuan

16
00:00:28.766 --> 00:00:30.300
I don't know what to say now.

17
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.400
I didn't know what to do.

18
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.666
If there is only pain when we are together

19
00:00:33.933 --> 00:00:35.933
Why don't we separate for a while and be quiet?

20
00:00:35.933 --> 00:00:38.666
Okay? Is that really what you think?

21
00:00:38.866 --> 00:00:40.933
I know about the death of your parents

22
00:00:40.933 --> 00:00:43.200
It is the pain in your heart that can never help poverty.

23
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.066
I'm just like you.

24
00:00:44.066 --> 00:00:46.600
I hate the one who made you lose your parents since you were a child

25
00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.866
The driver who grew up alone

26
00:00:49.166 --> 00:00:50.133
But I can't accept it

27
00:00:50.133 --> 00:00:52.966
That man is the father I have missed for more than 20 years

28
00:00:52.966 --> 00:00:55.166
He is the best father in my heart

29
00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:56.800
Every time I cry

30
00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.166
He will find any way to make me happy

31
00:00:59.200 --> 00:00:59.900
When crying

32
00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.266
He will be extremely distressed and say that he has a lot of tears for his daughter

33
00:01:02.266 --> 00:01:03.666
Stab me with his beard

34
00:01:03.666 --> 00:01:05.466
Try to make me happy in any way

35
00:01:06.533 --> 00:01:08.300
Ah, I see.

36
00:01:10.066 --> 00:01:11.400
I can set you free

37
00:01:11.933 --> 00:01:13.400
Give you enough time.

38
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.833
But I don't want a divorce.

39
00:01:16.266 --> 00:01:17.433
Don't want to be apart
