1
00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.700
Because his mother strongly disapproved of us being together

2
00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:05.200
Why? Because I am a poor girl from the countryside.

3
00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.266
And he's a rich kid in the city

4
00:00:07.266 --> 00:00:09.166
Our families are very different

5
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.466
The daughter-in-law his mother wants is a good family

6
00:00:11.466 --> 00:00:12.300
match

7
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.100
Anyone who can help his son in business

8
00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:16.300
50 years have passed

9
00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:19.100
I thought he only lived in my memory

10
00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:21.433
I didn't expect us to meet again

11
00:00:21.466 --> 00:00:23.500
Although I have achieved success now

12
00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:25.200
To be on par with Yoga

13
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:26.500
But nothing is wrong

14
00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:27.733
Time has not waited for us

15
00:00:27.733 --> 00:00:28.700
We are all getting old

16
00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:30.200
Impossible to be young again

17
00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:31.733
That fruitless first love

18
00:00:31.733 --> 00:00:33.500
Become our concern

19
00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:35.433
I see.

20
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.000
That's why you insist that we be married

21
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.566
You are my most precious granddaughter

22
00:00:40.566 --> 00:00:42.300
Xuan Xuan is Laoyou's favorite grandson

23
00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:42.900
Me and Old Oil

24
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.000
Love dreams that did not come true when you were young

25
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.566
We hope to make it happen for both of you

26
00:00:47.866 --> 00:00:49.366
I see.

27
00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.033
When did you get back?

28
00:00:55.133 --> 00:00:56.833
I heard what grandma said

29
00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.866
If you keep mentioning divorce in the future

30
00:01:00.066 --> 00:01:01.300
Beware of being struck by lightning

31
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:05.633
Yanyan Xuanxuan

32
00:01:05.766 --> 00:01:06.800
When I was young

33
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.000
You can see and catch a lot

34
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.400
But the easiest to get confused

35
00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.333
Always take unimportant things too seriously

36
00:01:13.333 --> 00:01:14.966
Wait until you reach my age

37
00:01:14.966 --> 00:01:16.533
And the days are dwindling.

38
00:01:16.533 --> 00:01:17.800
More and more expensive

39
00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:18.933
You will understand

40
00:01:18.933 --> 00:01:21.400
The few things you need most in life

41
00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:24.666
Grandma, I see.

42
00:01:24.733 --> 00:01:26.200
We'll be together

43
00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:27.200
Don't worry.

44
00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:28.600
There we go.
