00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:01.766
How do you know his name?

2
00:00:01.766 --> 00:00:02.800
He's my cousin.

3
00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:04.633
You guys are cousins?

4
00:00:05.366 --> 00:00:06.400
Anyway.

5
00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:07.966
You are not allowed to work here from now on

6
00:00:07.966 --> 00:00:10.866
Why? Because he knows you work here.

7
00:00:10.866 --> 00:00:13.033
So what? Go work somewhere else.

8
00:00:13.066 --> 00:00:14.700
If you have nothing else to do

9
00:00:14.766 --> 00:00:15.966
Just go

10
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.400
Don't affect my work

11
00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:20.166
Dear, there are no customers in the store at this time

12
00:00:20.166 --> 00:00:21.400
It will be available soon.

13
00:00:28.266 --> 00:00:29.066
Ha ha.

14
00:00:29.366 --> 00:00:31.066
Hahaha

15
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.066
Yo cousin is back

16
00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.566
Grandpa wishes you happiness like the East China Sea

17
00:00:39.566 --> 00:00:40.600
Shoubinan Mountain

18
00:00:40.666 --> 00:00:42.533
Have unfilial descendants like you

19
00:00:42.533 --> 00:00:44.233
I can't live that long.

20
00:00:46.166 --> 00:00:47.366
Yes, cousin.

21
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.700
You said that grandpa loves you the most

22
00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:51.100
You are so angry with grandpa

23
00:00:51.166 --> 00:00:52.600
It's so inappropriate

24
00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.300
That grandpa company is very busy

25
00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:56.633
I'll go back to the company first.

26
00:00:56.933 --> 00:00:59.766
If the company is busy, don't come back in the future

27
00:01:00.333 --> 00:01:02.100
Today is Grandpa's 70th birthday

28
00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.566
You don't accompany grandpa to celebrate his birthday before leaving

29
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.500
Isn't there something wrong?

30
00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.033
Then I'll go back to my room first

31
00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.866
Grandpa, I'm going to have a few words with my cousin first

32
00:01:18.933 --> 00:01:21.533
Why are you afraid that I will take away your An Jinyan?

33
00:01:21.533 --> 00:01:24.300
Get out! Why on earth do you hate me so much?

34
00:01:25.733 --> 00:01:26.866
I don't hate you.

35
00:01:27.333 --> 00:01:29.866
But I despise you.

36
00:01:30.066 --> 00:01:31.433
If it weren't for you

37
00:01:31.666 --> 00:01:33.400
The position of President of the Youshi Group

38
00:01:34.133 --> 00:01:35.700
It's mine.
