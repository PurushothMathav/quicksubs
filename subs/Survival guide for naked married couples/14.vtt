00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.500
What am I doing here when I'm not in the restaurant?

2
00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.166
I'm here to send information to my girlfriend

3
00:00:04.166 --> 00:00:05.400
How dare you say it?

4
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.666
I called you all afternoon and you didn't answer me

5
00:00:08.566 --> 00:00:09.766
Don't answer his phone

6
00:00:09.766 --> 00:00:11.900
Grandpa quickly divorced him

7
00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:16.366
I have too many words today

8
00:00:16.566 --> 00:00:17.900
You see, I haven't changed my clothes yet.

9
00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:18.700
I came to find you

10
00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:20.200
Is it true?

11
00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:21.400
Of course it's true.

12
00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.200
Then I have to deliver takeout with you tomorrow?

13
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:25.066
It is inconvenient for you.

14
00:00:26.533 --> 00:00:28.166
Fang Fang is convenient

15
00:00:28.866 --> 00:00:29.666
convenient

16
00:00:30.133 --> 00:00:31.200
I'm coming down.

17
00:00:31.533 --> 00:00:33.366
Hey brother hey brother

18
00:00:33.733 --> 00:00:35.900
Hey brother

19
00:00:36.566 --> 00:00:38.900
This is the delivery coach I found for you, Master Zhang

20
00:00:39.366 --> 00:00:40.800
Master Zhang Zhang

21
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.366
The master is an experienced rider with 20 years of experience

22
00:00:43.366 --> 00:00:46.233
Hand I believe Jewish guides you to takeout skills

23
00:00:46.366 --> 00:00:47.933
You will definitely be able to start soon

24
00:00:47.933 --> 00:00:49.000
Let's start practicing

25
00:00:51.666 --> 00:00:52.500
Hold hands tightly

26
00:00:53.166 --> 00:00:54.033
Be straight

27
00:00:54.566 --> 00:00:56.266
Rush forward regardless of everything

28
00:00:57.666 --> 00:00:59.166
I didn't expect it.

29
00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.000
My brother is still a good seedling for delivery.

30
00:01:03.333 --> 00:01:06.600
Brother, there are 100 luxury cars in our underground garage

31
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.000
I think you can deliver takeout by car.

32
00:01:09.066 --> 00:01:10.433
Stop talking nonsense

33
00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:13.833
Wow, wow, wow.

34
00:01:14.466 --> 00:01:15.600
Wow. Wow.

36
00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.800
Rush forward regardless of everything
