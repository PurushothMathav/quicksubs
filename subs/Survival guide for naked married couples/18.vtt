00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:05.000
This crocodile looks a lot like you.

2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.166
It's yours, good night, good night

3
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.433
Not like me

4
00:00:28.133 --> 00:00:29.833
Mr. An, your phone number.

5
00:00:32.466 --> 00:00:34.466
Hello, where do you work?

6
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.966
If I go to deliver takeout

7
00:00:37.066 --> 00:00:39.233
You can stop by to see how are you?

8
00:00:39.333 --> 00:00:41.500
I'll send you the address later, by the way.

9
00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.000
I am in your eyes

10
00:00:43.566 --> 00:00:45.133
Is it really the same as that crocodile?

11
00:00:45.133 --> 00:00:45.933
No.

12
00:00:45.966 --> 00:00:49.266
You are a little better looking than him, a little bit, a lot

13
00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.000
Honey bought me a convenience store in 10 minutes

14
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.866
Let me send me the address. Yes.
