00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:00.966
Empress mother

2
00:00:00.966 --> 00:00:03.100
Gave birth to such a gentle and beautiful girl

3
00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:04.366
You have a good eye, don't you?

4
00:00:04.366 --> 00:00:06.700
Our family would like to say that although otherwise average

5
00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:07.966
But say it gently.

6
00:00:07.966 --> 00:00:10.066
He was second. No one dared to be first

7
00:00:10.466 --> 00:00:12.733
Mom, how can I be as gentle as you say?

8
00:00:12.733 --> 00:00:13.866
It's very gentle

9
00:00:13.866 --> 00:00:15.200
I'm telling the truth.

10
00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.966
He grew up.

11
00:00:15.966 --> 00:00:17.400
Even an ant is reluctant to trample to death

12
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.466
Our Mingxuan was also a child.

13
00:00:19.466 --> 00:00:20.866
Very well-behaved and sensible

14
00:00:20.866 --> 00:00:23.333
I'm also afraid that he will be angry in the future if he marries a daughter-in-law

15
00:00:23.333 --> 00:00:24.333
Married now

16
00:00:24.333 --> 00:00:26.000
I'm at ease

17
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.933
By the way, Mingxuan

18
00:00:26.933 --> 00:00:28.066
Our family says

19
00:00:28.066 --> 00:00:30.066
Since childhood, my dream has been to have three babies

20
00:00:30.066 --> 00:00:31.900
This is the traditional Chinese medicine bag I prepared for the two of you.

21
00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:33.766
Hurry up while you are young

22
00:00:33.766 --> 00:00:34.800
The doctor said

23
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.333
As long as you take it on time.

24
00:00:36.333 --> 00:00:39.000
This child will soon have triplets

25
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.666
Quads are nothing

26
00:00:40.933 --> 00:00:42.200
Hahaha uh

27
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.566
Auntie, I just got married to Jing Yan

28
00:00:44.566 --> 00:00:47.200
Don't consider children for the time being.

29
00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.933
Since you are willing to give birth, let him give birth

30
00:00:49.933 --> 00:00:51.466
Your mother will take care of the child

31
00:00:51.466 --> 00:00:52.933
You can also bring ten or eight children.

32
00:00:52.933 --> 00:00:54.333
You want to say take care of children?

33
00:00:54.333 --> 00:00:57.233
I can talk to my in-laws until dawn

34
00:01:00.266 --> 00:01:02.466
Um, dad, auntie

35
00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:03.300
You talk first

36
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.133
Master Jing and I have something to do. Let's talk first

37
00:01:05.133 --> 00:01:06.400
Let's go first, you talk, you talk?

38
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:07.700
Have a good chat
