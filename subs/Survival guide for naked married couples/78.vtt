00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:02.800
With the strong blessing of the President of Anda

2
00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:06.366
Turning the tide and turning the world around is only a matter of time

3
00:00:06.366 --> 00:00:07.800
Are you so confident?

4
00:00:07.866 --> 00:00:09.800
What is the reason why I am not confident? Tell me.

5
00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:11.000
I really can't tell

6
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
And if I had no humanity

7
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.800
I won't make coffee for you by hand

8
00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:15.733
Except for Mr. An

9
00:00:15.733 --> 00:00:18.066
You are the first person to drink the coffee I made by hand

10
00:00:18.066 --> 00:00:20.833
Then I'm really honored.

11
00:00:30.666 --> 00:00:33.000
This is too bitter. What are you writing to me?

12
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.266
What do you know?

13
00:00:34.266 --> 00:00:35.866
It's called writing poetry.

14
00:00:36.066 --> 00:00:38.633
Mental Oak Mmmm

15
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.600
If I Love You

16
00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.800
Just be a kapok next to you

17
00:00:42.866 --> 00:00:45.766
Standing with you as the image of the tree

18
00:00:45.966 --> 00:00:47.700
You have your brass stick and iron cover.

19
00:00:47.733 --> 00:00:49.700
I have my red flowers

20
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.233
As if separated forever

21
00:00:54.766 --> 00:00:57.600
But stay with me forever

22
00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.833
How about being impressed by my brother's talent?

23
00:01:01.933 --> 00:01:04.500
I want to bow down under my brother's pomegranate pants

24
00:01:05.366 --> 00:01:07.700
Your pomegranate pants don't have a zipper.

25
00:01:08.666 --> 00:01:10.900
Hey, where are you looking?
