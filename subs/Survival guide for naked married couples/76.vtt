1
00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:02.100
Then it fits

2
00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:04.233
The truck at that time

3
00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:06.166
It's just coming straight ahead of us

4
00:00:06.166 --> 00:00:07.966
Police found a bottle of alcohol at the scene

5
00:00:08.133 --> 00:00:10.466
Think the crash was a drunk driving getaway

6
00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:11.866
So that car accident

7
00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:13.500
It was also determined to be an accident

8
00:00:13.766 --> 00:00:15.000
But everybody knows that.

9
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.500
That truck was coming straight at us

10
00:00:17.733 --> 00:00:20.300
If Liu Xingren is also alcohol immune

11
00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.233
Then all this is right

12
00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.700
Everyone has to pay for their mistakes

13
00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:25.866
kill for life

14
00:00:26.133 --> 00:00:27.966
When he chose this path

15
00:00:27.966 --> 00:00:29.266
You should think about the consequences

16
00:00:29.266 --> 00:00:30.766
Killing is addictive

17
00:00:31.166 --> 00:00:33.233
Killers' habits are also fixed

18
00:00:33.566 --> 00:00:35.500
So why did Willow Creek hire the murderer?

19
00:00:35.733 --> 00:00:37.233
Also alcohol immune

20
00:00:37.333 --> 00:00:38.900
That's no coincidence.

21
00:00:39.566 --> 00:00:42.600
You mean let Willow Creek hire alcohol immunizers

22
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.800
The person who killed me was also my father

23
00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:59.900
You don't care how cold and cruel the world is

24
00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:01.500
How fickle things are

25
00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.033
I will be by your side

26
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:04.766
Keep you safe

27
00:01:04.866 --> 00:01:06.000
Unchanged until death

28
00:01:06.866 --> 00:01:07.666
brother

29
00:01:07.666 --> 00:01:10.300
Then I will put the criminal evidence of Liu Xi and Liu Xiyuan

30
00:01:10.366 --> 00:01:11.566
Hand it over to the police
