1
00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:00.966
Warm man

2
00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:03.666
Mingxuan lost his parents since he was a child

3
00:00:03.666 --> 00:00:06.266
What he wants most is a warm and loving home

4
00:00:06.266 --> 00:00:08.466
I originally wanted to give birth to three babies for him

5
00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:11.166
It's hard to have one now

6
00:00:11.166 --> 00:00:13.500
I have also consulted other experts about your situation.

7
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.000
Not as serious as you say

8
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.066
You will have children of your own in the future

9
00:00:17.133 --> 00:00:18.766
What if there isn't?

10
00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:20.633
If a man

11
00:00:20.766 --> 00:00:22.800
Just so you can have children and marry you

12
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:23.900
Would you like to?

13
00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:25.200
Of course not.

14
00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.300
Two people together?

15
00:00:29.333 --> 00:00:31.566
The most important thing is to live a good life

16
00:00:31.666 --> 00:00:33.466
Can accompany each other

17
00:00:33.466 --> 00:00:35.800
That's the warmest home, this child

18
00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.200
Will grow up soon

19
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.766
Will become independent individuals

20
00:00:38.766 --> 00:00:39.900
Just like you.

21
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.300
The wings are hard, even the marriage is up to you

22
00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.666
Grandma can't stop you at all

23
00:00:43.666 --> 00:00:47.066
If you marry the wrong person, you will be unhappy

24
00:00:47.066 --> 00:00:49.566
How worried is grandma to leave one day?

25
00:00:49.566 --> 00:00:50.366
grandma

26
00:00:50.566 --> 00:00:53.700
I'm sorry, but it's not all your fault.

27
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.600
Let Xuanxuan marry you

28
00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.566
The selfishness of me and my old friend

29
00:00:57.766 --> 00:00:58.966
What selfishness

30
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.066
We were in the same university

31
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.700
Since you are alumni

32
00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:04.766
We are still each other's first love

33
00:01:04.766 --> 00:01:07.400
What? You're still your first lovers?

34
00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:08.100
Yes!

35
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.266
Then why didn't you get together later?
