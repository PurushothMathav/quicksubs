00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:02.833
Grandpa

2
00:00:04.866 --> 00:00:07.100
Grandma, I thought I'd never see you again

3
00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:09.266
God will surely bless you

4
00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:12.766
What about Xuanxuan? Mei Xuan is out on errands

5
00:00:14.933 --> 00:00:16.866
How are you feeling, Mrs Liu?

6
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.533
I feel okay.

7
00:00:18.533 --> 00:00:19.700
I just have a little pain in my waist.

8
00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:22.100
Your waist injury is serious.

9
00:00:22.133 --> 00:00:24.233
It may affect fertility in the future

10
00:00:24.366 --> 00:00:26.466
He will also need to be hospitalized for observation for a period of time

11
00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:27.900
See if there are any complications

12
00:00:27.933 --> 00:00:29.166
What does it mean to affect fertility?

13
00:00:29.166 --> 00:00:31.500
We have already told Mr. Liu about this.

14
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.766
Future pregnancies may be affected

15
00:00:33.766 --> 00:00:35.500
What sorry

16
00:00:37.333 --> 00:00:39.066
Grandpa Xu Jun also said

17
00:00:39.066 --> 00:00:40.733
It doesn't matter whether the child is born or not

18
00:00:40.733 --> 00:00:41.666
You relax

19
00:00:41.666 --> 00:00:43.200
Grandma is going to buy you food

20
00:00:43.366 --> 00:00:44.500
Is everything okay?

21
00:00:53.566 --> 00:00:55.333
Wenming Xuan, let's get a divorce

22
00:00:55.333 --> 00:00:56.766
Why do you suddenly have such a strange idea?

23
00:00:56.766 --> 00:00:58.133
I can't have children.

24
00:00:58.133 --> 00:00:59.500
I can't give you a complete home

25
00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.400
I don't care if you can have children or not

26
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:02.566
Don't think about it.

27
00:01:02.566 --> 00:01:04.100
I firmly disagree with divorce

28
00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:05.366
You stay in the hospital

29
00:01:05.366 --> 00:01:06.633
I'll come up now

30
00:01:07.166 --> 00:01:09.466
Brother, it seems that Mrs. Sister-in-law loves you very much.

31
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:10.633
Go back to the hospital
