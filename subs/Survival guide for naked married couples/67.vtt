00:00:01.366 --> 00:00:02.166
Hey

2
00:00:03.166 --> 00:00:04.933
That's how you know your father and sister

3
00:00:04.933 --> 00:00:06.500
I don't think it will work.

4
00:00:06.533 --> 00:00:08.200
They wept and confessed

5
00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:10.366
A man who swore to reform

6
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.000
Did Liu Xinyuan tell you?

7
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.133
He was seriously ill.

8
00:00:13.133 --> 00:00:14.600
I can't go see your mother

9
00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:18.200
Hmm, that's not right.

10
00:00:18.533 --> 00:00:20.666
There must have been another trick to my mother's death tonight

11
00:00:20.666 --> 00:00:21.866
What are you thinking about?

12
00:00:22.966 --> 00:00:25.166
I'm thinking this country is easy to change

13
00:00:25.366 --> 00:00:26.600
Nature is hard to change

14
00:00:26.766 --> 00:00:29.000
I'm afraid people like them will turn against you

15
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.666
They are all related to me by blood

16
00:00:31.666 --> 00:00:33.133
It's because of blood

17
00:00:33.133 --> 00:00:34.833
So you can't get too close.

18
00:00:34.966 --> 00:00:37.633
They're still asking us to have dinner tomorrow

19
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.300
Do you look down on them?

20
00:00:39.366 --> 00:00:40.333
It's what they do.

21
00:00:40.333 --> 00:00:41.733
I can't believe them.

22
00:00:41.733 --> 00:00:43.600
Why can't you let go of your prejudices?

23
00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.200
I care about you so I don't want them to hurt you.

24
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.000
Won't you hurt me like this?

25
00:00:50.266 --> 00:00:52.000
Where are you going to sleep in your room?

26
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.266
Sleep in separate rooms today

27
00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:00.066
We just got together for a few weeks and have to sleep in separate beds

28
00:01:00.166 --> 00:01:01.166
Divide

29
00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:09.900
Hello daylight saving

30
00:01:10.966 --> 00:01:13.200
Help me investigate the meteor shower yeah
