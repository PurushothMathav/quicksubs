00:00:07.966 --> 00:00:10.566
Oops, was there an earthquake just now?

2
00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:12.133
It seems so.

3
00:00:12.133 --> 00:00:14.300
I feel like Building 32 just shook a few times

4
00:00:14.366 --> 00:00:15.133
Not an earthquake

5
00:00:15.133 --> 00:00:18.166
It's 403 fathers arguing

6
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:19.900
That's a lot of noise.

7
00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:20.933
I'm afraid of killing people

8
00:00:20.933 --> 00:00:22.733
How much hatred is this?

9
00:00:22.733 --> 00:00:24.200
The house is going to be demolished

10
00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:25.200
Let's go and see.

11
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:26.100
Hurry up!

12
00:00:26.933 --> 00:00:28.000
I knew you were lying to me

13
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.466
I won't buy you this quilt

14
00:00:29.466 --> 00:00:30.800
We obviously sold it together.

15
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.266
I'm going to rip it open.

16
00:00:32.766 --> 00:00:35.233
Go, tear it away

17
00:00:47.966 --> 00:00:49.300
What are you doing?

18
00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:50.566
Family ugliness should not be publicized

19
00:00:50.566 --> 00:00:52.300
They are

20
00:00:53.866 --> 00:00:55.166
Ah, what's the matter?

21
00:00:55.166 --> 00:00:57.066
The couple is working

22
00:00:57.733 --> 00:01:01.200
Hey ma'am, are you all right? What can I do?

23
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:02.700
What are you doing in here?

24
00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:04.133
I heard from the neighbors that someone was fighting

25
00:01:04.133 --> 00:01:05.366
I'm afraid of killing people

26
00:01:05.366 --> 00:01:07.600
Who did you hear such rumors from?

27
00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.200
It's too late for us to love each other

28
00:01:10.733 --> 00:01:11.800
How could there be a fight?

29
00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.733
So what's going on in your house?

30
00:01:13.733 --> 00:01:14.933
Flirting is

31
00:01:14.933 --> 00:01:17.366
We just like to take apart some of our own home things.

32
00:01:17.366 --> 00:01:19.400
Is flirting illegal?

33
00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.800
Then please go out quietly next time

34
00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:22.600
The door is closed for me

35
00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:23.800
Don't come in again
