00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:01.800
I have investigated

2
00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:03.000
The diamond he gave

3
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.866
It's not a cheap man-made diamond at all.

4
00:00:04.866 --> 00:00:06.700
It's a rare real diamond worth over a million

5
00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:08.500
The superintendent just called me

6
00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:09.966
Notify me of a homeowners' meeting

7
00:00:09.966 --> 00:00:10.966
I just found out.

8
00:00:10.966 --> 00:00:13.300
He bought the house we lived in

9
00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.633
Your delivery guy is an invisible billionaire

10
00:00:16.866 --> 00:00:18.733
This is better than a frog turning into a prince

11
00:00:18.733 --> 00:00:19.666
And wonderful.

12
00:00:19.666 --> 00:00:21.900
Shh! He called.

13
00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:24.866
Hello wife

14
00:00:24.966 --> 00:00:27.433
I have a lot of takeout orders today, and I am very busy.

15
00:00:27.533 --> 00:00:28.866
I don't have time to pick you up from get off work.

16
00:00:28.866 --> 00:00:29.933
Then you go home early

17
00:00:29.933 --> 00:00:31.400
I'll wait for you at home. Okay.

18
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.766
When are you going to tell him?

19
00:00:34.766 --> 00:00:35.900
Your true identity

20
00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.300
I don't know. You want to keep it a secret?

21
00:00:38.366 --> 00:00:41.066
I just miss the ordinary days with him

22
00:00:41.133 --> 00:00:42.766
Just go on like this

23
00:00:42.766 --> 00:00:45.433
You want him to be your takeout guy all the time

24
00:00:45.533 --> 00:00:46.533
Neither

25
00:00:46.533 --> 00:00:48.666
I just don't want him to get rich
