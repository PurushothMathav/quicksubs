00:00:02.266 --> 00:00:03.733
Grandma, she's so emotional

2
00:00:03.733 --> 00:00:05.366
Your unexpected operation

3
00:00:05.366 --> 00:00:07.466
I don't even dare to write short sentences like this on the vertical screen

4
00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.200
The old lady didn't explode in place

5
00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:10.866
It's already very restrained

6
00:00:10.866 --> 00:00:13.000
After all, on your terms

7
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.900
Even if you don't marry those rich kids

8
00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:16.466
You should also marry a young genius

9
00:00:16.533 --> 00:00:18.166
Rather than ordinary like him

10
00:00:18.166 --> 00:00:20.700
But my ideal husband is as ordinary as him.

11
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.966
Brother, since you became the president

12
00:00:22.966 --> 00:00:24.600
The company's stock has risen fivefold

13
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.400
Business ability is obvious to all

14
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.300
But your ability to find sister-in-law

15
00:00:28.466 --> 00:00:30.266
Compared to your ability to work

16
00:00:30.266 --> 00:00:31.666
It's too bad.

17
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:32.733
Is there anything wrong with him?

18
00:00:32.733 --> 00:00:35.066
Compared to those rich daughters

19
00:00:35.133 --> 00:00:37.066
Some are too ordinary

20
00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:38.766
But I just like him.

21
00:00:38.766 --> 00:00:40.266
So when are you going to

22
00:00:40.266 --> 00:00:41.766
Tell your sister-in-law who you are

23
00:00:41.766 --> 00:00:43.500
Wait for grandpa to accept my wife

24
00:00:43.533 --> 00:00:45.166
Just ordinary people

25
00:00:45.166 --> 00:00:46.500
We are not short of money

26
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.066
But you two are so far apart

27
00:00:48.066 --> 00:00:49.233
Female high difficulty low

28
00:00:49.366 --> 00:00:50.833
Marriage is hard to be happy

29
00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:51.400
come

30
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.300
I'll show you the negative news about these flash marriages

31
00:00:53.466 --> 00:00:55.033
Hey, I don't want to see it.

32
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.400
Then I'll read it to you

33
00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:57.766
You can stop nagging.

34
00:00:57.766 --> 00:00:58.900
My brain is going to explode

35
00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:00.666
When do you have to wait?

36
00:01:01.066 --> 00:01:03.266
You don't like New Moon's granddaughter

37
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.133
Instead, I got married to a little girl in a convenience store

38
00:01:06.133 --> 00:01:08.500
You are going to piss grandpa off

39
00:01:08.933 --> 00:01:12.433
Hey, you said I'm married now.

40
00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.566
Is it time to buy a wedding house?

41
00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.966
Shh! Stop calling

42
00:01:24.133 --> 00:01:25.800
Hey where do you live now

43
00:01:26.533 --> 00:01:28.366
Ah, I live in Moshang Sweet City

44
00:01:28.366 --> 00:01:30.700
What about you? I don't have a place to live yet.

45
00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.800
I guess now that we're married

46
00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.200
I want to buy a wedding room near you

47
00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.166
buy a house

48
00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.300
In fact, you don't have to put so much pressure on yourself

49
00:01:39.366 --> 00:01:42.200
We can rent a house. We can rent a room.
