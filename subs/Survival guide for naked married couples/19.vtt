00:00:04.266 --> 00:00:05.233
Wait a minute.

2
00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:07.666
What do you need to pick up?

3
00:00:07.766 --> 00:00:10.166
The first is milk tea.

4
00:00:12.466 --> 00:00:13.633
Milk tea

5
00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.700
What about milk tea?

6
00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:19.133
Oh, we've been queuing for half a day.

7
00:00:19.133 --> 00:00:20.400
Can you check us out first?

8
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.033
If you don't check out, we'll be leaving.

9
00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.433
Come here, come here, hurry up, hurry up

10
00:00:25.666 --> 00:00:28.900
I don't know how to do the cash register.

11
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.433
Hurry up!

12
00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.300
Uh, I'm sorry, this cash register is broken.

13
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.166
Then you take your things away first

14
00:00:35.366 --> 00:00:36.900
That's more like it. Huh?

15
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.766
Hey, it's not that you are not familiar with your convenience store.

16
00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.166
Has the store just been renovated?

17
00:00:43.166 --> 00:00:45.100
Then your salary will be gone in less than three days.

18
00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:46.700
Xue Yiqian grows wiser?

19
00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.900
Sweet, you are finally here.

20
00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:57.833
Then I'm off work and going to the movies.

21
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.400
Okay, please.

22
00:01:01.566 --> 00:01:02.766
Going to the movies?

23
00:01:03.266 --> 00:01:05.066
No, what about my goods?

24
00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.100
Let's go, leave it to someone else

25
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.966
As long as you help me watch An Jinyan

26
00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.166
You will be my Dongfang Run woman in the future

27
00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:30.200
Your mother's hospital expenses

28
00:01:30.733 --> 00:01:32.400
It's on me.
