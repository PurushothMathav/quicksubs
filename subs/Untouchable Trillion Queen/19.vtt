1
00:00:00.083 --> 00:00:01.199
Just someone who seduces others

2
00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:02.082
To climb up

3
00:00:02.166 --> 00:00:02.599
If she hadn’t

4
00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:03.449
Clung to Young Master Qín

5
00:00:04.166 --> 00:00:05.565
What right would she have

6
00:00:05.566 --> 00:00:07.199
To stand before you discussing cooperation?

7
00:00:09.566 --> 00:00:11.165
Someone who climbs up with her body

8
00:00:11.166 --> 00:00:11.682
A piece of trash

9
00:00:12.366 --> 00:00:13.249
I think

10
00:00:13.483 --> 00:00:14.399
We should strip her naked

11
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.399
Throw her out of the company

12
00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.199
And blacklist her from the industry

13
00:00:18.533 --> 00:00:20.332
That’ll feel satisfying

14
00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:21.399
Exactly

15
00:00:22.166 --> 00:00:23.849
I’ll give you one more chance

16
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:25.965
Kneel down and apologize to me now

17
00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.282
Then serve me for one night

18
00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.282
If I’m pleased

19
00:00:30.683 --> 00:00:31.482
The cooperation

20
00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.049
Can still be considered

21
00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:33.932
Otherwise

22
00:00:34.533 --> 00:00:35.765
I’ll make sure you can’t hold your head up

23
00:00:35.766 --> 00:00:36.599
In this industry

24
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:39.932
Want to blacklist me?

25
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.132
Let’s see if you

26
00:00:41.133 --> 00:00:41.965
Have that ability

27
00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:43.599
Dì Háo Group

28
00:00:43.933 --> 00:00:45.399
May be the largest fashion company in the country

29
00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:46.199
But Qín Shì

30
00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:47.115
Isn’t weak in Dōng Hǎi either

31
00:00:47.733 --> 00:00:48.249
Vice President Wáng

32
00:00:49.883 --> 00:00:50.932
Think carefully

33
00:00:51.333 --> 00:00:52.565
The price of opposing Qín Shì

34
00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.482
Is a price you’ll have to pay

35
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.165
You, a woman who climbed up by selling her body

36
00:00:56.166 --> 00:00:57.399
Really think you’re somebody?

37
00:00:57.766 --> 00:00:59.565
Right?

38
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:00.249
Exactly

39
00:01:00.766 --> 00:01:01.449
Some people

40
00:01:02.133 --> 00:01:02.599
Never realize

41
00:01:03.566 --> 00:01:04.532
Their place

42
00:01:04.533 --> 00:01:04.765
Secretary Sū

43
00:01:07.083 --> 00:01:07.565
Why are you here?
