00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:02.919
Ease up a bit!

2
00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:05.599
I’m just looking out for you, aren’t I?

3
00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:06.759
That’s enough

4
00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:08.959
Can’t even handle a small task like this?

5
00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.079
I’m worried about you, that’s all

6
00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:13.839
Besides

7
00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.279
Qín Fēng may be the adopted son of the Qín family

8
00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:18.359
But failing to kill him this time

9
00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:19.679
Won’t that cause trouble?

10
00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:21.599
What’s there to fear?

11
00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:24.679
I’ve got ten billion in my hands now

12
00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.119
Who wins or loses is still up in the air

13
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:29.479
Could it be

14
00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.399
You’ve already thought of a way to deal with him?

15
00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.439
I heard the Eldest Miss of the Qín family

16
00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:35.439
Is returning to fight for the family fortune

17
00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:36.559
Against Qín Fēng

18
00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.279
As long as I can win over the Eldest Miss Qín

19
00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:42.319
Crushing Qín Fēng

20
00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:44.239
Wouldn’t that be as easy as squashing an ant?

21
00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.639
It’s that simple

22
00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.119
But how do we win over

23
00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.359
The Eldest Miss of the Qín family?

24
00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.199
What do you think of me?

25
00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:56.839
Jiā Háo

26
00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.279
You’re both talented and considerate

27
00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:00.439
The most

28
00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:01.399
Perfect man in the world

29
00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.999
As long as I become the Qín family’s son-in-law

30
00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:07.999
Dōng Hǎi

31
00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:09.919
Will be mine
