00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:01.359
Darling

2
00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:02.719
I’m waiting for you at the intersection

3
00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:03.719
Where we first met

4
00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:04.719
Waiting for you to take me to Korea

5
00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:06.199
What a coincidence

6
00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:07.639
Qín Ruò Yǔ

7
00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:09.479
Didn’t expect

8
00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:10.199
To run into the great Miss Jiǎng

9
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.159
In a place like this

10
00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:12.279
What are you doing here?

11
00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:14.119
Miss Jiǎng

12
00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:15.959
Seems to be waiting for someone

13
00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:18.199
Qín Ruò Yǔ

14
00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:19.799
Let me tell you straight

15
00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:21.079
I’m now

16
00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:22.479
The fiancée of the heir

17
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.479
To South Korea’s top chaebol group, the Pǔ family

18
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:25.679
Have you seen

19
00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.199
The necklace and ring I’m wearing?

20
00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:28.839
He bought them for me

21
00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.199
These are all limited-edition pieces

22
00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:32.559
Only the most powerful

23
00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:33.639
Can buy them

24
00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:35.279
Well then

25
00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:36.879
I must congratulate Miss Jiǎng

26
00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:39.159
On marrying into a top-tier elite family

27
00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:40.879
Qín Ruò Yǔ

28
00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:41.999
Don’t think just because you’re

29
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:42.639
The Eldest Miss of the Qín family

30
00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:43.759
I’ll be scared of you

31
00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:45.999
I’m about to trample you

32
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.079
Under my feet

33
00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:47.799
I’ll make you

34
00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:48.879
Like a dog

35
00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:49.959
Kneeling before me

36
00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:51.439
Soon enough

37
00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:53.799
But not quite yet

38
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.119
The Pǔ family’s daughter-in-law, right?

39
00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:56.959
What do you mean by that?

40
00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:58.199
Stop waiting

41
00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:59.559
He’s not coming

42
00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:00.799
Impossible

43
00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:01.919
He said

44
00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:03.559
He’d take me to Korea to get married

45
00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:04.639
I trust him

46
00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:08.199
Seeing you so naive

47
00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.999
I can’t bear to expose you

48
00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:11.279
Sorry

49
00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:13.319
Pǔ Chéng is my guy
