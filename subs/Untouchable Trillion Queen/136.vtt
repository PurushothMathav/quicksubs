00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.319
Your thing with Pǔ Chéng

2
00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:02.999
Young Master Wú suppressed the gossip

3
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.199
And the attacks against you

4
00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:05.839
Just so you

5
00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:07.759
Could happily marry into the Wú family

6
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:09.599
You always said no man

7
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:11.159
Could tolerate being cheated on

8
00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:12.319
But he

9
00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:13.599
Forgave you

10
00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:14.879
Time and time again

11
00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:16.399
And what about you?

12
00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:18.999
You threw away

13
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.199
The person who loved you most

14
00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:21.919
I didn’t

15
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:23.719
It’s all your fault

16
00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:24.919
You ruined me

17
00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.079
You ruined yourself

18
00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:28.039
If it weren’t for

19
00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:29.199
Your vanity and greed

20
00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:30.599
How would you end up like this?

21
00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:33.319
Young Master Wú may lack

22
00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:34.559
Ambition

23
00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.559
But he’s not like Fù Jiā Hào

24
00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:38.559
He never thought of using you

25
00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:40.159
He respected you

26
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.239
Loved you

27
00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:42.599
Gave you everything

28
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.239
You dreamed of being an elite lady

29
00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:45.399
But what about you?

30
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:46.679
Because of greed

31
00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:47.759
You lost

32
00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.159
The person who loved you most

33
00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:51.439
Qín Ruò Yǔ

34
00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:53.159
You’re just relying on

35
00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.239
Your better family background

36
00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:54.799
To stand here

37
00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:55.879
Pointing fingers at me, right?

38
00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:57.679
Let me tell you

39
00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:59.519
If you were me

40
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:00.079
You’d

41
00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:01.439
Make the same choice

42
00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:03.279
Why

43
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:04.479
Should I be

44
00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:05.359
Trampled by others?

45
00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:06.599
I

46
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.279
I want to be the one standing above others

47
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:10.879
I want others

48
00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:12.759
To look up to and flatter me

49
00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:14.439
People aim for higher places

50
00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:16.079
What did I do wrong?
