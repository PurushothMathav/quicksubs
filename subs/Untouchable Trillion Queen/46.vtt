00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:02.519
Brother Lǐ

2
00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:04.279
Why so down?

3
00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:05.999
Weren’t the girls in there fun?

4
00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:07.359
It’s all because of that Qín Ruò Yǔ

5
00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:08.319
That bastard

6
00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:09.439
I gave her face, but she didn’t want it

7
00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:11.559
President Lǐ

8
00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:14.079
For a big shot like you

9
00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:16.079
Qín Ruò Yǔ daring to treat you like this

10
00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:18.239
I feel embarrassed for you

11
00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:19.599
Brother Fù

12
00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:21.279
What do you mean?

13
00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:23.559
The reason Qín Ruò Yǔ

14
00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:24.359
Is so arrogant

15
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.039
Is just because she has Young Master Qín

16
00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:27.199
Backing her up

17
00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:28.839
But behind you

18
00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.119
Is the entire Dì Háo Group

19
00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:34.439
Tell me

20
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.919
If Young Master Qín stops wanting her

21
00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.359
Wouldn’t Dì Háo Group

22
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.879
Stand behind you?

23
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:43.399
That makes sense

24
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.839
So

25
00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:46.519
Isn’t it settled?

26
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:52.119
President Qín

27
00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.879
Earlier

28
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.559
I misspoke and offended you

29
00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:57.479
I toast you a glass

30
00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:59.039
As an apology

31
00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:00.479
President Lǐ, you’re too polite

32
00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:01.759
Tonight, I

33
00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:02.719
Drank a bit too much

34
00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:03.799
I really can’t drink anymore

35
00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:06.199
Just one glass

36
00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.999
Besides

37
00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.159
You can’t let me

38
00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:08.999
Lose face, right?

39
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.039
We still have to cooperate in the future

40
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:12.799
Since President Lǐ put it that way

41
00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.719
Let’s let the past unpleasantness

42
00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:15.999
Go by
