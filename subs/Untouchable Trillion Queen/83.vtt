1
00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.399
This venomous woman

2
00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.079
She’s keeping us from reuniting

3
00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.079
Hurry and kick her out

4
00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:18.639
You two claim to be

5
00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:19.279
My biological parents

6
00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.439
So let me ask

7
00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.319
Twenty-seven years ago

8
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:24.479
When you abandoned me

9
00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:24.879
At the orphanage

10
00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:25.839
What was its name?

11
00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:28.119
Happy Orphanage, right?

12
00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.519
I could never forget

13
00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:30.159
Wrong

14
00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.599
It was originally called Hope Orphanage

15
00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:34.439
Fifteen years ago

16
00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:36.599
It was officially renamed

17
00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:37.199
Happy Orphanage

18
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:39.119
What now?

19
00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:41.519
Fù Jiā Háo

20
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.639
Told you to pretend to be my parents

21
00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:44.359
Without preparing

22
00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:45.519
Properly beforehand?

23
00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.759
Son

24
00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:48.599
We’re old

25
00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:50.359
We just remembered wrong

26
00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:52.159
Now we recall

27
00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:54.599
It really was Hope Orphanage

28
00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.199
Then let me ask one more question

29
00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:59.119
The birthmark on my arm

30
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:01.079
Is it on my left arm

31
00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.759
Or my right?
