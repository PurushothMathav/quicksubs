00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:02.466
Yes, sir. Is there a problem?

2
00:00:02.466 --> 00:00:04.366
You shouldn't come up and judge people by their appearance

3
00:00:04.366 --> 00:00:05.600
Suppress me and humiliate me

4
00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:07.066
Then I called your manager over

5
00:00:07.066 --> 00:00:09.866
At the last minute I took out my Supreme VIP black card

6
00:00:09.866 --> 00:00:11.300
It's right to slap you in the face

7
00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:13.666
I'm sorry sir, I didn't understand what you mean.

8
00:00:13.666 --> 00:00:16.366
I can ask the manager to receive you if you want.

9
00:00:18.766 --> 00:00:19.700
Not fun.

10
00:00:21.733 --> 00:00:23.766
Miss Chen is a smart person

11
00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:25.333
should

12
00:00:25.333 --> 00:00:27.133
Know how much this loan will help you start a family

13
00:00:27.133 --> 00:00:27.966
Does it matter?

14
00:00:29.666 --> 00:00:31.666
Why don't you sleep with me for one night?

15
00:00:31.666 --> 00:00:33.233
I'll grant you the loan

16
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:36.466
You are so old and need someone to sleep with you

17
00:00:36.466 --> 00:00:38.166
I'm not your mother

18
00:00:38.166 --> 00:00:39.133
Forget it

19
00:00:39.133 --> 00:00:39.566
Start a family

20
00:00:39.566 --> 00:00:41.200
Why did you call such a beautiful woman here?

21
00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.666
Talk to me, do you really not understand?

22
00:00:47.166 --> 00:00:48.600
I don't know what you mean.

23
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.133
But my mom said if you touch me here

24
00:00:51.133 --> 00:00:52.600
Just one punch

25
00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.866
Okay, let's play, right?

26
00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:58.500
If you want a loan, there is no guard at the door.

27
00:00:58.533 --> 00:01:00.066
Someone committed a murder at the bank

28
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.900
Hold him up for me

29
00:01:03.533 --> 00:01:04.400
Stop

30
00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.033
Who are you, Chen Jiang?

31
00:01:10.733 --> 00:01:12.033
Chen Beixuan
