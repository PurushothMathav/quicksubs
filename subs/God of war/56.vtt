00:00:01.466 --> 00:00:03.800
OK, I'll take the money.

2
00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:04.600
Jiang Jia

3
00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:06.866
Good girl

4
00:00:07.733 --> 00:00:09.666
Jiang Jia and I have a blood feud

5
00:00:09.666 --> 00:00:11.266
There is no possibility of reconciliation

6
00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:15.366
This 3 million the money you paid for the table

7
00:00:15.366 --> 00:00:16.900
Now you can go away.

8
00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:23.200
I give you candy

9
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:24.666
It's for your face.

10
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.333
You don't have to abstain from alcohol. You can't eat alcohol if you don't eat it.

11
00:00:27.333 --> 00:00:29.633
Stop talking nonsense and keep the money

12
00:00:29.733 --> 00:00:30.866
Get out of here

13
00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:33.766
You know what you're cold about

14
00:00:34.666 --> 00:00:36.833
Do you know how many families are behind me?

15
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.633
You can hit me in the face alone

16
00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.400
But you offended a dozen private groups

17
00:00:41.766 --> 00:00:43.066
I say a word

18
00:00:43.166 --> 00:00:44.433
Your Chen family doesn't even have ash left

19
00:00:44.933 --> 00:00:47.733
Well, then you call them all over

20
00:00:47.733 --> 00:00:50.066
Save me from looking for it one by one

21
00:00:50.266 --> 00:00:51.066
young man

22
00:00:51.533 --> 00:00:52.433
Don't be too arrogant

23
00:00:53.333 --> 00:00:55.466
Well, that's called exuberance

24
00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.566
Then I'll tell you now

25
00:00:57.733 --> 00:00:59.200
What is gas?

26
00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.800
I don't care what's behind you, cat or dog

27
00:01:08.933 --> 00:01:10.433
Go back and tell him

28
00:01:10.933 --> 00:01:13.000
I will accompany you to the end

29
00:01:15.966 --> 00:01:18.033
Ok you wait

30
00:01:18.166 --> 00:01:19.666
With you kneeling and begging for mercy

31
00:01:20.066 --> 00:01:23.233
Hey, hey, hey, Mr. Bai, Mr. Bai

32
00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:24.633
Don't be angry.

33
00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:25.700
We'll talk about it.

34
00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.833
You can talk about everything. Talk about shit

35
00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:29.866
You wait to eat

36
00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.233
Hey Mr. Bai

37
00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:39.833
member

38
00:01:39.866 --> 00:01:42.800
Why do you say you offended him at this time?

39
00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:43.900
Now our Chen family

40
00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:45.866
There is no way out at all
