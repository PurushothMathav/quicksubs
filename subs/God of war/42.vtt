00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.966
I'm here today to kill the martial arts hall

2
00:00:03.133 --> 00:00:04.833
Destroy the wild species under the city

3
00:00:04.866 --> 00:00:06.500
I want the world to know

4
00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:08.800
The end result of going against my Jiang family

5
00:00:09.166 --> 00:00:11.733
The surname is fake, you affect my apprenticeship

6
00:00:11.733 --> 00:00:14.400
Are you going against the three of us?

7
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.600
You old things

8
00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.300
While I'm not at the Jiang family

9
00:00:18.566 --> 00:00:20.366
You take the money from the Jiang family

10
00:00:20.366 --> 00:00:23.266
He actually went to worship the enemy of my Jiang family as a teacher

11
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.466
How do you make our Jiang family face?

12
00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.266
I really didn't see that stinky money

13
00:00:30.666 --> 00:00:33.000
If anyone dares to oppose my master today

14
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.633
Is to be our enemy

15
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.100
That being the case

16
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.833
Then I'll let you all die here today

17
00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.800
This is the five eat Meng Hu

18
00:00:43.133 --> 00:00:44.366
He took me for granted.

19
00:00:44.366 --> 00:00:45.600
Murder

20
00:00:45.733 --> 00:00:47.433
Love to kill grandmasters

21
00:00:47.533 --> 00:00:48.900
Humph tiger

22
00:00:49.566 --> 00:00:51.166
These old guys

23
00:00:51.166 --> 00:00:53.233
This is me finding a new toy for this today

24
00:00:53.566 --> 00:00:55.033
It's business

25
00:00:56.466 --> 00:01:00.300
Hahaha Grandmaster is cheap enough to kill

26
00:01:00.366 --> 00:01:03.233
Still killing you on my mother's head can afford a ring

27
00:01:05.366 --> 00:01:06.500
You can leave.

28
00:01:06.566 --> 00:01:07.900
You are no match for him

29
00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:09.033
I don't believe it.

30
00:01:09.533 --> 00:01:12.300
It looks like dead muscle from the gym

31
00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:14.033
I can still give it to him

32
00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:15.700
Yeah.

33
00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.166
Wahahahaha

34
00:01:25.966 --> 00:01:27.266
Who is this guy?

35
00:01:27.266 --> 00:01:28.066
It turned out to be so

36
00:01:28.066 --> 00:01:30.666
Master, we are not his opponents

37
00:01:30.966 --> 00:01:33.066
Master, run away

38
00:01:33.166 --> 00:01:34.366
We stall him

39
00:01:36.966 --> 00:01:38.700
Since you called me master

40
00:01:39.133 --> 00:01:41.200
Nature won't make you angry

41
00:01:44.333 --> 00:01:46.200
Another one is full
