00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.900
Ahai give it to me

2
00:00:01.933 --> 00:00:05.066
Ya girl, do you know who the woman is here?

3
00:00:05.066 --> 00:00:06.700
What a joke!

4
00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:09.300
She is a poor boy and deserves to let me know

5
00:00:09.333 --> 00:00:10.133
Are you blind?

6
00:00:10.133 --> 00:00:11.166
Give it to me now

7
00:00:11.166 --> 00:00:12.866
It's just two of your legs

8
00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.600
I am enough by myself

9
00:00:14.666 --> 00:00:16.800
I respect our hospital

10
00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.800
So much nonsense at a young age

11
00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:21.900
How is that possible?

12
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.966
How could there be such an expert lady in my little dream?

13
00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:26.666
Getting sick in December is not easy

14
00:00:26.666 --> 00:00:27.166
You see you see

15
00:00:27.166 --> 00:00:28.266
No refund here.

16
00:00:28.266 --> 00:00:29.400
This is my last chance.

17
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:30.366
Wait until grandpa finds that person

18
00:00:30.366 --> 00:00:31.400
Definitely better than me marrying him

19
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.366
I want me to exchange more benefits.

20
00:00:33.366 --> 00:00:34.600
I must take this opportunity

21
00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:35.733
Have access to sufficient resources

22
00:00:35.733 --> 00:00:37.166
Take control of my own destiny

23
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.366
It's too late to leave now.

24
00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.033
Don't you need to pay for smashing things?

25
00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:42.066
Joke

26
00:00:42.066 --> 00:00:44.166
I don't have the word retreat in Li Meng's dictionary

27
00:00:44.166 --> 00:00:46.066
A man is like a dead Xiao Du inherits

28
00:00:46.066 --> 00:00:48.100
Sure enough, Li Leg, who has never seen the world

29
00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.166
Isn't it just a broken toothpaste?

30
00:00:51.666 --> 00:00:53.600
This is 100, don't look for it.

31
00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.100
Humph 100

32
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.833
You have to pay me at least 500 million for this toothpaste.

33
00:00:58.166 --> 00:01:00.833
How dare you blackmail me?

34
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:02.000
Even the city lord in your dreams

35
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.466
You dare not talk to me like that

36
00:01:03.933 --> 00:01:05.500
Know how many five-for-one traps there are

37
00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.266
Enough to kill you

38
00:01:07.333 --> 00:01:08.000
Do you believe it or not?

39
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.700
I have a phone call

40
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.733
You can make your entire village disappear silently

41
00:01:10.733 --> 00:01:11.366
Die

42
00:01:11.366 --> 00:01:13.666
Li Meng, shut up
