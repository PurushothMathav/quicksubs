00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:01.466
Who wants to work?

2
00:00:04.566 --> 00:00:05.466
Store Manager

3
00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:08.300
You guys looked at us like thieves the whole time.

4
00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:09.800
And we're going to change clothes

5
00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:11.566
He actually asked us to open the door

6
00:00:11.666 --> 00:00:13.400
Do we have to undress in public?

7
00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:14.900
Are you all perverts?

8
00:00:15.166 --> 00:00:16.300
What's the noise?

9
00:00:16.533 --> 00:00:18.833
We don't have any problems at the radio station.

10
00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.866
Two poor losers can't afford anything

11
00:00:23.466 --> 00:00:24.466
You come to our store

12
00:00:24.466 --> 00:00:26.766
Of course I wonder if you're here to steal.

13
00:00:26.766 --> 00:00:29.800
I'm going to search you now

14
00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.833
What qualifications do you, a store manager, have to send my god?

15
00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:35.833
Very good. Do you know who I am?

16
00:00:35.966 --> 00:00:37.200
Who is management?

17
00:00:37.266 --> 00:00:39.100
I'm going to search you today

18
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.400
That's right, you two are suspects now

19
00:00:42.466 --> 00:00:44.500
A body search is required

20
00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:46.833
Especially this lady

21
00:00:49.366 --> 00:00:52.000
Even wilder, now take off your clothes

22
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Technical inspection

23
00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:55.900
You can hit me

24
00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:57.666
Nature's child is my brother-in-law

25
00:00:57.666 --> 00:00:59.033
I won't let you go.

26
00:00:59.966 --> 00:01:02.266
Ok wait

27
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.166
I'm craving you now

28
00:01:05.166 --> 00:01:06.666
The clerk said I stole his stuff

29
00:01:06.666 --> 00:01:08.133
And asked to be searched

30
00:01:08.133 --> 00:01:10.266
He also said that his brother-in-law was from the Sheriff's Department

31
00:01:10.266 --> 00:01:11.900
Let me walk around

32
00:01:11.933 --> 00:01:13.933
I'll give you one minute to come over here

33
00:01:13.933 --> 00:01:16.066
Otherwise you'll never show up

34
00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:18.466
Listen to this tone

35
00:01:18.466 --> 00:01:20.066
It seems to be calling our boss.

36
00:01:20.066 --> 00:01:22.066
Hahaha died of laughter

37
00:01:22.066 --> 00:01:23.333
Pretending to look like

38
00:01:23.333 --> 00:01:25.266
The last one who dared to yell at our store manager

39
00:01:25.266 --> 00:01:27.366
Still stepping on the sewing machine at the police station

40
00:01:28.366 --> 00:01:29.166
Young Master
