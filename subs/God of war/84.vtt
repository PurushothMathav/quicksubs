1
00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:01.833
You want to take me as your adopted son

2
00:00:02.366 --> 00:00:03.166
Humph

3
00:00:09.733 --> 00:00:12.500
Take his back to the sky

4
00:00:12.533 --> 00:00:14.966
No, I tried my best

5
00:00:14.966 --> 00:00:16.766
Just received the protection of the ancestor of the dead

6
00:00:16.766 --> 00:00:17.333
Now.

7
00:00:17.333 --> 00:00:19.966
Chen Beixuan followed us all at once

8
00:00:19.966 --> 00:00:20.766
This clown

9
00:00:20.766 --> 00:00:22.066
Or are we?

10
00:00:22.066 --> 00:00:23.766
You want to say that I am a adopted son?

11
00:00:24.133 --> 00:00:25.033
Chen Meixue

12
00:00:25.966 --> 00:00:28.066
This is a waiter at the University of Commerce

13
00:00:28.466 --> 00:00:29.633
too much progress

14
00:00:30.366 --> 00:00:32.300
Hurry up and kneel down Shane

15
00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.000
You old dog too

16
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.266
Pardon me?

17
00:00:36.466 --> 00:00:39.600
I'll give you a chance to say it again.

18
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.300
I said you deceived your teacher and destroyed your ancestors

19
00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:42.266
No talent, no virtue

20
00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.966
Just a lecherous and incompetent rat

21
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.266
You still want me to be your son

22
00:00:47.266 --> 00:00:49.366
I'm ashamed to be your father

23
00:00:49.366 --> 00:00:50.166
Humph

24
00:00:51.166 --> 00:00:54.200
Ask him to insult his dead ancestors in public

25
00:00:54.533 --> 00:00:57.266
I think your suicide attempt has come to an end

26
00:00:57.666 --> 00:00:58.500
Dead Earth Ancestor

27
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.200
You're welcome to face this door

28
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.466
Just kill him

29
00:01:02.466 --> 00:01:04.800
Please ask the ancestor to kill Chen Beixuan

30
00:01:04.966 --> 00:01:05.866
Humiliate the ancestor

31
00:01:06.166 --> 00:01:07.966
He is the worst enemy of the Throw family

32
00:01:07.966 --> 00:01:09.400
What are you two waiting for?

33
00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:10.866
Hurry up and kill him

34
00:01:11.866 --> 00:01:13.600
The sins of heaven cannot be violated

35
00:01:13.666 --> 00:01:15.166
Production is impossible

36
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.466
No human body has ever been joined by my brothers

37
00:01:17.933 --> 00:01:20.033
Boy, if you are free

38
00:01:20.166 --> 00:01:21.433
I'll give you a quick one.

39
00:01:21.733 --> 00:01:24.100
Two broken dogs also match

40
00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.566
Farewell to Anglo-British Crazy
