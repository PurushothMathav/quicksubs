00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:02.433
Miss

2
00:00:07.533 --> 00:00:10.466
Are the two beautiful women also here to find me?

3
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.400
Hey, I'm familiar with this scene

4
00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.466
Two beautiful women are here to divorce me, right?

5
00:00:21.666 --> 00:00:23.700
Have you watched too many Mini Program skits?

6
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:25.166
You don't deserve it.

7
00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:27.166
This is 2 million

8
00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.666
Enough for you to settle down

9
00:00:28.666 --> 00:00:31.000
Hurry up and sign the contract

10
00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.333
It turns out that you are also from the demolition team

11
00:00:36.333 --> 00:00:38.566
As I said, my father won't let me go out

12
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.166
I still have to live in this house

13
00:00:40.166 --> 00:00:42.366
Besides, this house is too expensive for you to demolish

14
00:00:42.366 --> 00:00:43.566
Don't say 2 million

15
00:00:43.566 --> 00:00:45.166
Even if it is 200 million, I will not dismantle it.

16
00:00:46.166 --> 00:00:48.166
Now get out of here with your dog

17
00:00:48.166 --> 00:00:51.400
You even dare to scold my eldest lady

18
00:00:51.533 --> 00:00:52.966
You are dead

19
00:00:53.066 --> 00:00:55.966
My eldest lady is a 5-7 expert

20
00:00:55.966 --> 00:00:59.266
Killing you is as easy as killing an ant

21
00:00:59.366 --> 00:01:00.166
Wow

22
00:01:01.133 --> 00:01:02.400
Who gave you a short sentence?

23
00:01:03.166 --> 00:01:04.366
My anti-drug

24
00:01:05.933 --> 00:01:07.000
Miss

25
00:01:11.266 --> 00:01:13.866
What era is it?

26
00:01:13.866 --> 00:01:15.500
Is there something wrong with your brain?

27
00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:16.700
Treat if you are sick

28
00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.200
Don't delay my construction here

29
00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:19.266
You know, to Miss Ben

30
00:01:19.266 --> 00:01:20.400
How much damage did it cause?

31
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.966
Girl, you should be grateful that my father gave it to me

32
00:01:22.966 --> 00:01:24.100
I can't get rid of the mysterious iron refining

33
00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:25.600
The rule of no force

34
00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.166
Otherwise I can't

35
00:01:29.333 --> 00:01:30.700
I'm giving you one last chance.

36
00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.800
Here you go 3 million get out of my eyes

37
00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:34.466
Huh 3 million

38
00:01:37.166 --> 00:01:39.400
3 million can't even buy my toothpaste

39
00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:43.300
Toast well and don't eat penalty wine, right?

40
00:01:43.766 --> 00:01:44.266
today

41
00:01:44.266 --> 00:01:45.466
I'll let you poor boy know

42
00:01:45.466 --> 00:01:46.566
Offend me

43
00:01:46.566 --> 00:01:47.900
Ahai give it to me

44
00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:49.066
Destroy them both
