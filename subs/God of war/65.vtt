00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.400
First of all, congratulations to the kylin child of the warring country lord

2
00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:04.766
Happy Love Lu

3
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.600
Next, I would like to congratulate the warring country lord in heaven

4
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:09.866
Huzi Longsun

5
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.866
The warring country lord is really old and strong

6
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.600
Is the sword not old?

7
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:17.033
Double happiness today

8
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:21.566
All your aristocratic families have rewards

9
00:00:28.333 --> 00:00:29.700
I am your daughter

10
00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.633
You actually deserve a divorce for me

11
00:00:31.766 --> 00:00:33.966
And I want this old lady to spoil me

12
00:00:34.133 --> 00:00:35.800
Are you still human?

13
00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:38.500
Aju

14
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:40.866
You've been with me for two years

15
00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.466
I have never considered you my assistant

16
00:00:43.466 --> 00:00:46.100
I've always treated you like a sister

17
00:00:47.133 --> 00:00:49.400
Sorry miss

18
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:50.766
I approached you at first

19
00:00:50.766 --> 00:00:53.000
It's because the Situ family chose you right

20
00:00:54.866 --> 00:00:57.166
Sooner or later, it will be a money-losing product to get married

21
00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.833
Without sacrificing yourself to complete the great cause of our Li family

22
00:01:00.966 --> 00:01:02.300
My whole life

23
00:01:02.533 --> 00:01:05.366
The thing I regret the most is being your daughter

24
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.266
If I had known, I would have listened to my grandfather's words and married Chen Meijuan

25
00:01:09.733 --> 00:01:11.866
Do you think Chen Beixuan can save you?

26
00:01:12.066 --> 00:01:13.366
This is Philadou

27
00:01:13.466 --> 00:01:14.666
No matter who comes

28
00:01:14.666 --> 00:01:15.866
All bow down

29
00:01:17.666 --> 00:01:19.233
Who is who?

30
00:01:19.533 --> 00:01:21.566
Who will stand up for me?
