00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.166
What's another piece?

2
00:00:02.166 --> 00:00:03.600
I only auctioned one piece.

3
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.000
It didn't say that only one piece of chopped green onion is important to save people

4
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.366
I'll let the scallion cut the auction piece

5
00:00:08.466 --> 00:00:10.633
I offered to send you this favor.

6
00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:14.166
This world can't live without

7
00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:17.400
This piece is for Du Lao

8
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:18.866
If Du Lao can really develop a medicine

9
00:00:18.866 --> 00:00:19.733
Merit in Contemporary Times

10
00:00:19.733 --> 00:00:20.733
Profit in Chiaki

11
00:00:20.733 --> 00:00:23.333
I just hope that when Du Lao is a medicine, he will not charge a high price for the medicine.

12
00:00:23.333 --> 00:00:24.300
Be treated equally

13
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.266
Let everyone in the world be treated

14
00:00:26.266 --> 00:00:27.400
cure the disease

15
00:00:27.766 --> 00:00:29.100
Small and high

16
00:00:29.166 --> 00:00:32.066
The old man admires Mr. Gao Yi and Miss Li

17
00:00:32.066 --> 00:00:33.900
Do you want me to sell it to you?

18
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:35.066
Or give it to you?

19
00:00:35.066 --> 00:00:36.100
Just make an offer.

20
00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:37.366
I don't want to owe you a favor

21
00:00:37.366 --> 00:00:39.666
Then I'll give it to you.

22
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.666
You look just like your father

23
00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:45.266
Jiang Shun, what else do you have to say now?

24
00:00:45.266 --> 00:00:46.233
I don't admit it

25
00:00:46.333 --> 00:00:48.333
If the dragon head stick is lost in my hands

26
00:00:48.333 --> 00:00:49.833
Lao Tzu's lifeline is gone

27
00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:51.766
Am I bargaining

28
00:00:51.766 --> 00:00:53.666
Do you still want to play the nonsense?

29
00:00:53.666 --> 00:00:55.866
I also call it Chen Dollar's Money
