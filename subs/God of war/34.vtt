1
00:00:07.333 --> 00:00:09.033
How do you know I can't afford it?

2
00:00:09.166 --> 00:00:10.666
I'm sorry, we really have respect today.

3
00:00:10.666 --> 00:00:11.966
Expensive customers are coming to our store.

4
00:00:11.966 --> 00:00:13.666
It is inconvenient to receive you, please go out.

5
00:00:13.666 --> 00:00:15.300
I said what's wrong with you

6
00:00:15.733 --> 00:00:16.866
He's my friend.

7
00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:25.466
You came just in time. Here's a dress I like

8
00:00:25.466 --> 00:00:27.766
You have to cooperate with me to buy any clothes.

9
00:00:27.766 --> 00:00:29.233
Mom this dress

10
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.700
This set of clothes is the treasure of our store

11
00:00:33.733 --> 00:00:36.300
Gas indicates that the price is about 10 million or more

12
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.866
One man and one woman must sell the whole set.

13
00:00:39.466 --> 00:00:42.466
OK, we're going to try the eyeless redneck

14
00:00:42.466 --> 00:00:45.400
Can you afford to break more than 10 million clothes?

15
00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:48.633
Even if you sell it for 100 million, can't you try it first?

16
00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:49.566
Go get it

17
00:00:53.966 --> 00:00:55.866
Why buy such expensive clothes?

18
00:00:56.066 --> 00:00:58.566
I've loved this dress for a long time

19
00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.266
I can feel its essence in the design

20
00:01:01.333 --> 00:01:03.566
Unfortunately, this dress is not for sale alone

21
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:05.000
OK

22
00:01:07.333 --> 00:01:08.233
What are you doing?

23
00:01:08.866 --> 00:01:11.333
I've seen a lot of hillbillies like you

24
00:01:11.333 --> 00:01:12.133
You close the door.

25
00:01:12.133 --> 00:01:13.666
Who knows if you will sneak away

26
00:01:13.666 --> 00:01:15.266
Take the things in our store

27
00:01:15.333 --> 00:01:17.300
More than 10 million clothes were damaged

28
00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:18.600
Can you afford it?

29
00:01:19.566 --> 00:01:20.800
Call your manager over

30
00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.200
Our manager is not like you.

31
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.666
You can see what you want

32
00:01:24.466 --> 00:01:25.833
Don't go out!
