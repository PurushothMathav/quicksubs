1
00:00:01.966 --> 00:00:02.966
So here we go.

2
00:00:02.966 --> 00:00:04.266
This is a small vendor.

3
00:00:04.266 --> 00:00:06.400
Please accept it with a smile as a gift to the descendants of the Li family.

4
00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:07.733
put on airs

5
00:00:07.733 --> 00:00:08.500
Don't tell me

6
00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:10.800
You, a fried powder seller, also know stocks

7
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.100
Listen, he's a layman

8
00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:14.966
Don't look at this line chart

9
00:00:14.966 --> 00:00:16.066
Open your mouth

10
00:00:16.066 --> 00:00:17.100
They know.

11
00:00:17.133 --> 00:00:20.100
Do you need to analyze where to buy stocks?

12
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.766
Hahahaha

13
00:00:22.066 --> 00:00:23.200
He sells fried

14
00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.733
Fans have no access to stocks

15
00:00:25.733 --> 00:00:28.800
How could he know that stocks still need analysis?

16
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:29.866
This kind of person?

17
00:00:29.866 --> 00:00:32.100
Appeared in my Li family

18
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:34.866
What a tragedy for the whole family

19
00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:37.700
As long as you are happy

20
00:00:37.733 --> 00:00:38.900
I'll go first

21
00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.133
Roll as far as possible

22
00:00:41.133 --> 00:00:42.900
Don't say your last name Li in the future

23
00:00:43.133 --> 00:00:44.766
By the way, three days later

24
00:00:44.766 --> 00:00:47.300
It was me and the daughter of the Tang family who talked about Aoxue's wedding

25
00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.733
I prepared some light wine in the imperial building

26
00:00:49.733 --> 00:00:51.466
Welcome, uncles and uncles

27
00:00:51.466 --> 00:00:52.866
Hope not to dislike

28
00:00:52.866 --> 00:00:54.200
What are you going to get drunk

29
00:00:54.466 --> 00:00:56.633
Wedding in the Imperial Palace

30
00:00:57.666 --> 00:00:59.500
I'm dying of laughter.

31
00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.700
Do you know what the Imperial Palace is?

32
00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.500
That building is the top one.

33
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.266
Nine Star Premier Hotel

34
00:01:06.266 --> 00:01:07.733
Minimum cost?

35
00:01:07.733 --> 00:01:09.900
Million from you

36
00:01:10.066 --> 00:01:11.500
Fried powder for a lifetime

37
00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.800
Don't even think about entering the threshold of the imperial building

38
00:01:13.966 --> 00:01:16.800
I still hope to hold a wedding in the Imperial Palace

39
00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.666
Hahaha hey

40
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.666
The second uncle is just pretending

41
00:01:21.666 --> 00:01:24.166
There's no need to poke people out

42
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.733
Failed to inherit the board

43
00:01:25.733 --> 00:01:28.533
My big brother is already very devastated.

44
00:01:28.533 --> 00:01:29.633
Brag

45
00:01:29.933 --> 00:01:33.166
It's human nature to regain your self-esteem

46
00:01:33.166 --> 00:01:37.900
Otherwise, you really have to jump off the building and commit suicide, hahaha.

47
00:01:40.733 --> 00:01:42.566
What? Are you serious?

48
00:01:42.566 --> 00:01:45.100
Stock has fallen by 90%.
