1
00:00:00.933 --> 00:00:02.700
Well, thank you, Governor

2
00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.200
Thank you. You're very kind.

3
00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.300
It should be, it should be

4
00:00:06.366 --> 00:00:08.766
My migrant worker brother, have you seen it?

5
00:00:08.766 --> 00:00:11.400
Even the Governor came to my wedding

6
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:12.666
Also sent a congratulatory gift

7
00:00:12.666 --> 00:00:14.766
What do you compare to me?

8
00:00:14.766 --> 00:00:15.800
You are mighty

9
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:19.566
You are offside because of the cloud business giant

10
00:00:19.566 --> 00:00:21.700
You are the head of the horse and the mountain.

11
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:23.733
Dear

12
00:00:23.733 --> 00:00:25.933
Now believe that your choice is correct

13
00:00:25.933 --> 00:00:26.766
Tell me about it.

14
00:00:26.766 --> 00:00:28.933
I will not regret what I did today

15
00:00:28.933 --> 00:00:29.966
What choice?

16
00:00:29.966 --> 00:00:31.933
And decided not to look at me like that

17
00:00:31.933 --> 00:00:34.000
Be careful for a while

18
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.900
What? I'm so happy.

19
00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.566
The Governor himself came to our scene today

20
00:00:38.566 --> 00:00:39.700
To congratulate us on our wedding

21
00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:41.266
You're still looking for presence here

22
00:00:41.266 --> 00:00:42.900
You pretend to be the sword lord

23
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.700
I'm going to jail soon

24
00:00:46.333 --> 00:00:47.966
Impersonating Lord Jianjun

25
00:00:47.966 --> 00:00:49.400
In fact, it's as simple as going to jail

26
00:00:49.733 --> 00:00:51.966
Why did I become an impostor like this?

27
00:00:51.966 --> 00:00:54.166
Mr. Li, your identity and strength

28
00:00:54.166 --> 00:00:58.066
How can a group of local chickens and dogs question and pretend?

29
00:00:58.066 --> 00:01:00.400
Why is he also Mr. Li?

30
00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:01.266
His Excellency the Governor

31
00:01:01.266 --> 00:01:02.200
He's my brother.

32
00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.100
A Li family wife sells fried noodles on the street

33
00:01:05.133 --> 00:01:06.133
You're pissed.

34
00:01:06.133 --> 00:01:07.366
This is too disappointing

35
00:01:07.366 --> 00:01:08.366
Zhang Yongchang

36
00:01:08.366 --> 00:01:11.800
Do you think you've been governor for too long?

37
00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.366
Who are you? What do you mean?

38
00:01:13.366 --> 00:01:15.333
You mistook the sword lord

39
00:01:15.333 --> 00:01:16.866
What do you think I mean?

40
00:01:16.866 --> 00:01:18.966
What? I mistook the sword lord

41
00:01:18.966 --> 00:01:20.900
Mr. Li by my side

42
00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.466
The one you should congratulate today

43
00:01:23.466 --> 00:01:26.200
Lord Jianzun, the owner of Kowloon Shop
