1
00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.000
But you can't blame me.

2
00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:03.533
I don't want to look down on you either

3
00:00:03.533 --> 00:00:06.166
After all, you are also my fiancÃ©.

4
00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:09.100
After 5 years, you will only sell fried noodles on the street

5
00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:11.666
As long as the people around me mention you

6
00:00:11.733 --> 00:00:13.066
Even I will look down on it

7
00:00:13.066 --> 00:00:15.400
Do you know how stressed I am?

8
00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.733
Stress you are stressed

9
00:00:17.733 --> 00:00:19.300
That's because you want to be envied

10
00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:20.200
Want to be promoted by others

11
00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.733
And these are more important than your feelings

12
00:00:22.733 --> 00:00:23.666
But

13
00:00:24.466 --> 00:00:27.400
Who in the world doesn't want to be envied?

14
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.666
Who doesn't love vanity when being touted?

15
00:00:29.666 --> 00:00:32.566
Not everyone is as accomplished as you are

16
00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:35.866
And realm, so that's how things are

17
00:00:35.866 --> 00:00:37.066
The more you demand

18
00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:38.366
Instead of

19
00:00:42.166 --> 00:00:45.266
Originally, this crown also had the giant souls of various countries

20
00:00:45.466 --> 00:00:47.700
Congratulations on the top weddings that are all yours

21
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.100
But your mind

22
00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.933
Your pattern

23
00:00:49.933 --> 00:00:52.133
Your vision is not worthy of him after all

24
00:00:52.133 --> 00:00:53.400
Born a Crow

25
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.233
Never change phoenix

26
00:00:55.266 --> 00:00:56.666
Is he going to choose?

27
00:00:56.666 --> 00:00:57.333
You have

28
00:00:57.333 --> 00:00:58.900
I don't deserve to stand in this one that belongs to the heroine

29
00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:00.000
On the high stage

30
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.566
Hello Li Wushuang

31
00:01:01.566 --> 00:01:03.300
You're not so heartless

32
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.866
My daughter has spent the past few years

33
00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:07.733
The best youth has been given to you

34
00:01:07.733 --> 00:01:09.966
Otherwise you will have a head and face

35
00:01:09.966 --> 00:01:12.200
You abandoned him

36
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.533
Presumptuous what are you

37
00:01:14.533 --> 00:01:16.900
How dare you accuse Mr. Li of credits

38
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.666
Forget it, Mr. Li, you helped the Tang family rise

39
00:01:20.666 --> 00:01:23.133
Instead of being grateful, they blame you

40
00:01:23.133 --> 00:01:24.533
I can't take it anymore.

41
00:01:24.533 --> 00:01:25.433
Yeah.

42
00:01:25.966 --> 00:01:27.166
Without my support

43
00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:28.266
Tangjiabiwa

44
00:01:28.333 --> 00:01:30.300
You'd better bring your husband and daughter.

45
00:01:30.333 --> 00:01:31.566
Go back to the countryside to farm

46
00:01:31.566 --> 00:01:33.666
Witness, don't do this

47
00:01:33.666 --> 00:01:36.200
I know you like us Aoxue

48
00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.533
You will be very happy together

49
00:01:38.533 --> 00:01:39.700
The point is not the shower

50
00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:40.900
You don't deserve it.

51
00:01:40.966 --> 00:01:42.066
I see.

52
00:01:42.666 --> 00:01:43.966
aunt

53
00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:48.033
Forget it, save me some face
