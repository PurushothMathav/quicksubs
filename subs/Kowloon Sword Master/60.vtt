00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:00.966
How come?

2
00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:04.066
It must be Lord Jianzun's mobile phone lost.

3
00:00:04.066 --> 00:00:05.933
He found Lord Sword Venerable's cell phone

4
00:00:05.933 --> 00:00:08.600
Then pretend to be Lord Sword Lord

5
00:00:08.766 --> 00:00:09.933
It's not impossible

6
00:00:09.933 --> 00:00:12.000
Lord Jianzun, the dragon sees the head but not the tail

7
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.333
Even the people of the Kowloon Hall can only hold their fingers

8
00:00:14.333 --> 00:00:15.333
Several people have seen him

9
00:00:15.333 --> 00:00:16.900
Usually through his phone number

10
00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:17.766
Take orders

11
00:00:18.066 --> 00:00:19.566
Hahahaha

12
00:00:19.566 --> 00:00:20.966
There you go.

13
00:00:20.966 --> 00:00:23.133
Otherwise, he is Lord Jianjun

14
00:00:23.133 --> 00:00:25.200
Then I am the Jade Emperor

15
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.366
It seems that his words are too high

16
00:00:28.366 --> 00:00:29.766
He fooled us all.

17
00:00:29.766 --> 00:00:30.566
Say

18
00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:32.366
Did you pick up the surveillance?

19
00:00:32.366 --> 00:00:34.066
Lots of phone calls, Mr. Li

20
00:00:34.066 --> 00:00:35.966
Let me kill him, don't worry

21
00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:37.666
Your name is Zunlong, right?

22
00:00:37.666 --> 00:00:39.966
Looks like I have to give an order

23
00:00:39.966 --> 00:00:41.500
Send you back to the beast room of the headquarters

24
00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.300
Put you in a glacier prison

25
00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:45.166
Hahahaha

26
00:00:45.466 --> 00:00:47.866
Just because you picked up the phone and ordered me

27
00:00:47.866 --> 00:00:49.300
Do you think I will obey?

28
00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.400
I advise you to go back with me and entertain clearly

29
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:56.300
Otherwise, I will arrest you with my own hands and go back to Kowloon Hall to ask for understanding.

30
00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.900
Why don't we report it to the sheriff's office?

31
00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:01.200
Let the sheriff's department check his identity

32
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.966
Isn't the resume clear?

33
00:01:02.966 --> 00:01:05.333
Yes, you must report to the security bureau

34
00:01:05.333 --> 00:01:07.333
We must not allow such criminals

35
00:01:07.333 --> 00:01:08.600
Be a caught fish

36
00:01:09.766 --> 00:01:11.466
Okay, I'll report it.

37
00:01:12.133 --> 00:01:15.300
Like if I give you one last chance

38
00:01:15.533 --> 00:01:17.300
Did you admit it yourself?

39
00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.066
Or should I report to the public security to arrest you? You're welcome.

40
00:01:20.066 --> 00:01:20.866
Then you go and report it?

41
00:01:20.866 --> 00:01:22.100
I'm waiting to catch me

42
00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:23.833
Do you think I dare not?

43
00:01:24.066 --> 00:01:25.800
I'll call him now.

44
00:01:30.133 --> 00:01:32.100
Hello

45
00:01:32.266 --> 00:01:34.700
We have people here posing as heroes of our country

46
00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:35.400
Your Honor

47
00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.466
criminal violation
