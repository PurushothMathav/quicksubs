1
00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:01.300
In front of you

2
00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:02.666
I will be more humble

3
00:00:02.666 --> 00:00:03.966
Did you know

4
00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:06.133
Who benefited from the Kowloon Group?

5
00:00:06.133 --> 00:00:08.433
It's good to give you a trillion-dollar investment in the Tang family.

6
00:00:09.166 --> 00:00:11.133
Could it be that God Bless said it was you?

7
00:00:11.133 --> 00:00:13.133
Who else do you think would take such good care of you?

8
00:00:13.133 --> 00:00:13.733
That's enough!

9
00:00:13.733 --> 00:00:16.200
Don't you have a little bit of grooming heart?

10
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.066
I am the president of Tangmen Group

11
00:00:18.066 --> 00:00:20.600
And you're just a little street vendor

12
00:00:20.866 --> 00:00:21.966
What do you take care of me

13
00:00:21.966 --> 00:00:23.500
It's Master Dongjie

14
00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:24.333
All said

15
00:00:24.333 --> 00:00:26.900
It was he who fought with Lord Zunlong of the Kowloon Group

16
00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:28.366
Investment that has just been pulled

17
00:00:28.533 --> 00:00:29.933
How dare you pretend to get it?

18
00:00:29.933 --> 00:00:31.466
And he said that.

19
00:00:31.466 --> 00:00:33.100
It is the Kowloon Group that you benefit from.

20
00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.366
Do you know what kind of existence the Kowloon Group is?

21
00:00:35.366 --> 00:00:37.933
He is the pinnacle of the unparalleled in the world

22
00:00:37.933 --> 00:00:39.366
Lord Jianzun

23
00:00:39.366 --> 00:00:42.066
The greatest genius since human civilization

24
00:00:42.066 --> 00:00:45.000
You also said that the Kowloon Group you benefited from

25
00:00:45.366 --> 00:00:47.700
Let Lord Jianzun know how you died

26
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.066
Don't know anything

27
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.700
You said it was Li Dongjie

28
00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:52.700
Help your Tang family

29
00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.600
Received a trillion-dollar investment from Kowloon Group

30
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.733
Why? Are you ashamed?

31
00:00:56.733 --> 00:00:58.266
Ben is a brother

32
00:00:58.366 --> 00:00:59.700
Look how depraved you are

33
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:01.600
Let's see how promising they are

34
00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.200
And Master Dongjie

35
00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.466
Also help us Mr. Tang

36
00:01:04.466 --> 00:01:06.966
Introduced Lord Zunlong of Kowloon Group as a godfather

37
00:01:06.966 --> 00:01:08.700
You have helped us a lot, Mr. Tang

38
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.000
The two of them are a better match

39
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.566
He is. Are you going to marry my sister?

40
00:01:13.966 --> 00:01:14.866
Marry Li Dongjie

41
00:01:14.866 --> 00:01:15.966
You don't have to worry about that.

42
00:01:15.966 --> 00:01:17.700
All you have to do is promise to break up the engagement with me

43
00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.366
I still remember when I was the Crown Prince of the Li family

44
00:01:20.366 --> 00:01:21.500
You say you don't deserve me

45
00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.200
Enough is enough, a lot of things are not what they used to be

46
00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:25.800
I know it hurts.

47
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:26.566
unwilling

48
00:01:26.566 --> 00:01:27.933
But you have to accept the reality.

49
00:01:27.933 --> 00:01:30.733
Daxia has always paid attention to the right match for thousands of years

50
00:01:30.733 --> 00:01:33.066
Talented women and us

51
00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.500
So I suggest you give up

52
00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.466
Otherwise you will regret it

53
00:01:39.533 --> 00:01:42.466
You said I would regret it if I didn't give up

54
00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.833
If you don't regret it, then promise to break the engagement?
