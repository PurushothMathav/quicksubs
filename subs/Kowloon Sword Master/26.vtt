00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:00.733
aunt

2
00:00:00.733 --> 00:00:03.500
Speaking at such an old age is responsible

3
00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:05.400
What, you want to threaten me?

4
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:06.800
Just to remind you

5
00:00:07.133 --> 00:00:08.666
Let you stop being so powerful

6
00:00:08.666 --> 00:00:11.966
Otherwise, it will be bad if you can't get off the stage one day.

7
00:00:12.266 --> 00:00:14.266
Is it keeping me off the stage?

8
00:00:14.266 --> 00:00:17.166
Do you still think you are the prince of the Li family?

9
00:00:17.166 --> 00:00:20.100
No, the Li family has long given up on you

10
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.000
Now your brother is the heir to the Li family

11
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.066
Just an heir to the Li family

12
00:00:25.566 --> 00:00:28.466
I never took it personally.

13
00:00:28.466 --> 00:00:29.200
Humph

14
00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.866
I don't think you can eat grapes and say grapes are sour.

15
00:00:31.866 --> 00:00:32.800
Don't worry.

16
00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:36.966
Today, the whole Yuncheng will know who I am

17
00:00:36.966 --> 00:00:37.733
At that time

18
00:00:37.733 --> 00:00:40.533
You and many others will feel blind

19
00:00:40.533 --> 00:00:42.400
How dare you say I'm blind?

20
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:43.500
I won't smoke you today

21
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.000
I'm sorry for my temper

22
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:45.966
What are you doing?

23
00:00:45.966 --> 00:00:49.000
Auntie, you have cirrhosis of the liver and you are so angry

24
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.566
Are you not afraid of death?

25
00:00:50.933 --> 00:00:52.066
How did you know I had cirrhosis?

26
00:00:52.066 --> 00:00:53.266
I know.

27
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.566
You can never imagine

28
00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:56.900
Oh, I see.

29
00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:59.300
You must have installed a monitor in our house

30
00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.966
Otherwise, the results I got from the hospital yesterday

31
00:01:01.966 --> 00:01:02.933
How do you know?

32
00:01:02.933 --> 00:01:05.666
No, big brother, you are actually such a person

33
00:01:05.866 --> 00:01:07.466
Peeping at his mother-in-law

34
00:01:07.466 --> 00:01:08.766
Are you still human?

35
00:01:08.766 --> 00:01:11.500
How dare you attack your mother-in-law?

36
00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.466
The quality of rural people is indeed poor

37
00:01:13.466 --> 00:01:16.733
It seems that Miss Tang can't get married

38
00:01:16.733 --> 00:01:18.600
You migrant worker, what the hell did you do?

39
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.666
Don't say I'll call the police to arrest you
