1
00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:04.600
Don't be afraid, I still have cards

2
00:00:04.766 --> 00:00:08.400
Can you make him hold the handrail?

3
00:00:09.766 --> 00:00:13.433
Show your cards and I'll see who you are

4
00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:17.400
Didn't you just call and say you wanted to declare war on me?

5
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:18.500
You are the sword lord

6
00:00:22.933 --> 00:00:24.666
Except for me

7
00:00:24.766 --> 00:00:26.166
How many more can

8
00:00:26.166 --> 00:00:28.566
Walk up to your Hades with a swagger

9
00:00:28.566 --> 00:00:30.066
Make you order

10
00:00:30.066 --> 00:00:33.700
Activate the global underground forces and invade northern Europe

11
00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.166
You're going to war with me

12
00:00:35.166 --> 00:00:36.500
Am I still being polite to you?

13
00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.066
I admit that you have some strength

14
00:00:39.066 --> 00:00:41.266
But you're so arrogant

15
00:00:41.266 --> 00:00:42.900
A horse came up to me.

16
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.366
It seems that you still don't know my horror.

17
00:00:45.366 --> 00:00:48.166
In my eyes, everything is dust

18
00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:49.366
You are no exception

19
00:00:49.366 --> 00:00:50.166
Then let me see.

20
00:00:50.166 --> 00:00:51.933
Can you get out of here alive?

21
00:00:51.933 --> 00:00:53.833
Shoot me

22
00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:57.766
Admiralty photo volcano

23
00:00:57.766 --> 00:00:59.166
Volcanoes are like ghost mountains
