1
00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:01.700
I asked him to steal it for you.

2
00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:03.566
Do you think I wouldn't know?

3
00:00:03.566 --> 00:00:05.733
What? You said you let him steal it?

4
00:00:05.733 --> 00:00:08.066
Li Wushuang, can you still order your face?

5
00:00:08.066 --> 00:00:09.600
When Mr. Wu voted for me

6
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.700
You are being kicked out of the Li family to apply for a job

7
00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:14.900
You have a little bit

8
00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:16.666
It's not like you can't find a job

9
00:00:16.666 --> 00:00:18.100
Reduced to fried noodles on the street

10
00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:18.900
That is.

11
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.766
You only ate the soft rice of the Jiang family now.

12
00:00:21.766 --> 00:00:23.600
You really think you're somebody?

13
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:24.400
You are wrong

14
00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.800
I married Mr. Li because he was in love

15
00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:27.900
I climb up to him

16
00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.766
You dare to slander Mr. Li again

17
00:00:29.766 --> 00:00:32.266
But I ran the Tang family alone

18
00:00:32.266 --> 00:00:33.466
He said it was his doing.

19
00:00:33.466 --> 00:00:35.266
You can't ruin my life

20
00:00:35.266 --> 00:00:36.566
I know you don't believe it.

21
00:00:36.566 --> 00:00:40.166
Then you can call Wu Dajiang now and ask him

22
00:00:40.166 --> 00:00:41.766
Okay, just hit

23
00:00:41.766 --> 00:00:43.600
I'm not used to you yet

24
00:00:47.166 --> 00:00:48.566
Remember to turn on the PA

25
00:00:54.566 --> 00:00:56.233
Hello, Don

26
00:00:56.733 --> 00:00:59.800
Mr. Wu has something small to disturb you.

27
00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.166
Don't be so polite.

28
00:01:01.166 --> 00:01:03.066
If you have anything, just say it.

29
00:01:03.066 --> 00:01:05.466
What can help you is better than doing your best

30
00:01:05.466 --> 00:01:06.566
I want to ask

31
00:01:06.566 --> 00:01:07.833
Five years ago.

32
00:01:07.866 --> 00:01:10.100
The first 30 million you invested in me

33
00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.300
Do you mean it yourself?

34
00:01:13.366 --> 00:01:15.300
This little Don

35
00:01:15.333 --> 00:01:18.100
Why did you suddenly remember to ask this?

36
00:01:18.166 --> 00:01:20.600
Because a shameless person told me

37
00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.733
He told you to invest in me

38
00:01:22.733 --> 00:01:25.700
I want to poke him hard and block his face

39
00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.966
Really? Who is that?

40
00:01:27.966 --> 00:01:30.333
That's my ex-fiance.

41
00:01:30.333 --> 00:01:32.433
Li's wife Li Wushuang
