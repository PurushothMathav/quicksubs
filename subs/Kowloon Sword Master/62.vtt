00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.466
What dad

2
00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:02.466
What's up?

3
00:00:02.466 --> 00:00:05.333
All the shares of Auditorium Group will be sold out at once

4
00:00:05.333 --> 00:00:11.033
The 300 billion market value went to zero in an instant

5
00:00:12.333 --> 00:00:12.966
How is that possible?

6
00:00:12.966 --> 00:00:15.066
Our stock is in the hands of all users

7
00:00:15.266 --> 00:00:17.166
How could it be thrown away all at once?

8
00:00:17.166 --> 00:00:18.333
Yeah, how is that possible?

9
00:00:18.333 --> 00:00:20.400
Millions of users have negotiated together

10
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:21.966
Isn't that possible?

11
00:00:23.166 --> 00:00:24.566
Did you receive a scam call?

12
00:00:24.566 --> 00:00:27.266
It's a call from the head of our auditorium

13
00:00:27.266 --> 00:00:28.366
Say the whole

14
00:00:28.366 --> 00:00:31.966
The auditorium company was completely abandoned in just 30 seconds

15
00:00:31.966 --> 00:00:33.500
I can only watch helplessly

16
00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:34.600
Shares of Auditorium Group

17
00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.966
A fall from a cliff?

18
00:00:37.666 --> 00:00:39.400
That doesn't work.

19
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.300
You simple business minds

20
00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.066
How can we understand the business sniping of the top and peak?

21
00:00:44.066 --> 00:00:44.866
how

22
00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:46.866
Don't you know?

23
00:00:46.866 --> 00:00:48.666
When you have enough strength

24
00:00:48.666 --> 00:00:50.333
You can put the other party's stock

25
00:00:50.333 --> 00:00:51.733
Divided into countless anchor points

26
00:00:51.733 --> 00:00:53.100
Buy it all in hand

27
00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.400
Do you think your stocks

28
00:00:54.766 --> 00:00:55.900
In 100,000 people

29
00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:56.733
million hands

30
00:00:56.733 --> 00:00:58.466
In fact, these 100,000 hands

31
00:00:58.466 --> 00:01:01.266
There is only one hand behind a million hands

32
00:01:01.266 --> 00:01:04.100
So he wants your stock to go up

33
00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.200
If you want your stock to die, die

34
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.133
Do you understand?

35
00:01:07.133 --> 00:01:09.666
A person holds a million hands

36
00:01:09.666 --> 00:01:10.966
It's impossible.

37
00:01:10.966 --> 00:01:12.600
Don't use your understanding and cognition

38
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.400
To analyze anyone in the world

39
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.333
Because there are many people who stand taller than you

40
00:01:17.333 --> 00:01:18.400
Stop pretending

41
00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:19.566
If you were taller than me

42
00:01:19.566 --> 00:01:21.800
Now I have given birth to your child.

43
00:01:21.866 --> 00:01:23.900
Why would I kick you?

44
00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.666
Do you think after others heard that you kicked the sharp lord

45
00:01:26.733 --> 00:01:27.733
Would you say you're smart?

46
00:01:27.733 --> 00:01:29.566
No one here believed

47
00:01:29.566 --> 00:01:31.066
You can't even handle your mother

48
00:01:31.066 --> 00:01:33.800
Why do you still want to emphasize that you are the sword lord?

49
00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.066
Who dares to impersonate Lord Jianzun and commit a crime?
