1
00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.833
There we go.

2
00:00:02.133 --> 00:00:03.800
Wait don't go

3
00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:05.533
Shit, is there anything else?

4
00:00:05.533 --> 00:00:07.666
Today you put down what you are doing

5
00:00:07.666 --> 00:00:08.766
Come to my wedding

6
00:00:08.766 --> 00:00:10.000
These are my brothers.

7
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.500
Anyone who looks down on you looks down on me

8
00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:15.300
Even if I don't get married today

9
00:00:15.366 --> 00:00:16.833
I also want you to eat here

10
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.000
Li Wushuang, what do you mean?

11
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.266
You have to go against me

12
00:00:20.266 --> 00:00:22.000
Are you trying to piss me off?

13
00:00:22.366 --> 00:00:23.700
I said Boss Tang

14
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:25.866
Your daughter is so outstanding

15
00:00:25.866 --> 00:00:28.133
She is just a Li family wife

16
00:00:28.133 --> 00:00:29.400
How can I deserve it?

17
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:30.766
Return this attitude

18
00:00:30.766 --> 00:00:34.066
If it was me, I couldn't stand it for a long time.

19
00:00:34.066 --> 00:00:35.466
I've already heard

20
00:00:35.466 --> 00:00:37.800
The Li family has inherited the Li family

21
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.566
Inherit to the second son Li Dongjie

22
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.100
He has completely fallen out of favor and has been reduced to a commoner

23
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.500
Aoxue follow him

24
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.466
It's a waste.

25
00:00:47.466 --> 00:00:49.300
I persuaded Aoxue

26
00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:50.866
Let him tear up the book

27
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.633
He had to insist.

28
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.166
Miss Tang is really affectionate

29
00:00:56.166 --> 00:00:57.600
It's a pity. It's a pity.

30
00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:58.800
I don't care.

31
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.833
Today, these migrant workers are not leaving

32
00:01:00.866 --> 00:01:01.900
I just die.

33
00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:03.666
I won't let Aoxue marry you either

34
00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.733
Forget it, I won't make it difficult for you

35
00:01:05.733 --> 00:01:07.400
Why don't we go?

36
00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:08.833
Don't go

37
00:01:09.466 --> 00:01:11.266
Hey, it's alright, nonsense

38
00:01:11.266 --> 00:01:12.733
We all know you are a good person.

39
00:01:12.733 --> 00:01:13.866
Miss Tan is excellent

40
00:01:13.866 --> 00:01:15.933
We are all happy for you to marry her.

41
00:01:15.933 --> 00:01:18.600
Don't let us see if you're married or not.

42
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.066
We all feel guilty

43
00:01:20.066 --> 00:01:22.133
Oh yes I said we were country people

44
00:01:22.133 --> 00:01:24.066
I'm used to being yelled at by the rich

45
00:01:24.066 --> 00:01:24.933
It's okay.

46
00:01:24.933 --> 00:01:26.966
You don't have to care that we scold the population

47
00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:28.200
Stop talking

48
00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:30.066
I have to let you know today

49
00:01:30.066 --> 00:01:32.100
I booked the opera hotel here

50
00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.400
I have the final say here

51
00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:34.900
Whoever dares to look down on you

52
00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:36.500
That's my enemy.
