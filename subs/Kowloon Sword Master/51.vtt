1
00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:02.666
That's my ex-fiance.

2
00:00:02.666 --> 00:00:04.533
Li's wife Li Wushuang

3
00:00:04.533 --> 00:00:06.300
What, Mr. Li?

4
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:07.933
Yeah, what's wrong with Mr. Wu?

5
00:00:07.933 --> 00:00:08.966
Do you know him?

6
00:00:08.966 --> 00:00:09.933
Of course I do.

7
00:00:09.933 --> 00:00:11.100
I, General Wu

8
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:13.933
Today, I can sit in the position guarded by the male god

9
00:00:13.933 --> 00:00:16.133
The past life was given by Mr. Li

10
00:00:16.133 --> 00:00:18.700
Mr. Li has been kind to me again

11
00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:20.666
How could I not know

12
00:00:21.133 --> 00:00:21.933
What!

13
00:00:21.933 --> 00:00:25.566
You said that the location of your down payment depends on his reminder.

14
00:00:25.666 --> 00:00:27.533
Are you right?

15
00:00:27.533 --> 00:00:30.333
I'm also the first instance down payment

16
00:00:30.333 --> 00:00:32.966
How can you say such a thing?

17
00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:35.966
But even the head of the Li family couldn't tolerate him

18
00:00:35.966 --> 00:00:37.833
The whole family looked down on him

19
00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:39.900
He can only be reduced to him even if he sells fried powder

20
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.200
What ability does he have to carry Mr. Wu's name?

21
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.533
Hey, Don

22
00:00:44.533 --> 00:00:46.966
You are so wrong

23
00:00:46.966 --> 00:00:49.566
Mr. Li is the person involved

24
00:00:49.566 --> 00:00:51.533
I just don't like fame and fortune

25
00:00:51.533 --> 00:00:53.700
Although I don't know his origin

26
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.200
But I do know this.

27
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.400
His business acumen is simply superb

28
00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:02.100
My company was on the verge of bankruptcy at the time

29
00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.400
I only heard a few words from Mr. Li

30
00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.766
Immediately retreat to the camp forever, at the cost of death

31
00:01:06.766 --> 00:01:08.466
And then rise to the top

32
00:01:08.466 --> 00:01:10.600
It's amazing. It's amazing.

33
00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.300
Among the people the old Buddha desires in his life

34
00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:15.666
Mr. Li is a myth

35
00:01:15.733 --> 00:01:18.833
Did he give you the 30 million?

36
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:19.700
Enterprise Instructions

37
00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.933
The 30 million investment was announced by Mr. Li and I invested

38
00:01:22.933 --> 00:01:25.366
The subsequent multiple investments have been completed

39
00:01:25.366 --> 00:01:26.333
Strategic Analysis

40
00:01:26.333 --> 00:01:28.000
Beat the competition

41
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.766
Even the listing planning of Tangmen Group

42
00:01:30.766 --> 00:01:34.233
It is all the guidance of Mr. Li's office that benefits

43
00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:35.100
What!

44
00:01:35.766 --> 00:01:37.800
How is that possible?
