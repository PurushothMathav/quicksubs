00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:01.066
Thank you very much.

2
00:00:01.133 --> 00:00:05.633
Then go to the table inside and wait for the feast, hahaha.

3
00:00:06.533 --> 00:00:07.333
Ah!

4
00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.500
Li Wushuang, are you crazy?

5
00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:13.533
What two cats and two dogs, please come in

6
00:00:13.533 --> 00:00:15.400
They are all my relatives and friends

7
00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.666
Come congratulate me what's the problem

8
00:00:17.666 --> 00:00:19.600
You don't see what this place is

9
00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:20.900
What arrangement?

10
00:00:20.933 --> 00:00:22.333
Nine-star imperial building

11
00:00:22.333 --> 00:00:24.266
Who here is not a business celebrity?

12
00:00:24.333 --> 00:00:25.500
wealthy family

13
00:00:25.533 --> 00:00:27.400
You set up a group of migrant workers to come in

14
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.066
Are you trying to piss me off?

15
00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:30.266
What happened to the migrant workers?

16
00:00:30.566 --> 00:00:32.066
Are migrant workers not human?

17
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:34.766
Everyone is divided into three, six, nine, etc

18
00:00:34.933 --> 00:00:36.066
different classes

19
00:00:36.066 --> 00:00:39.366
My Tang family's marriage to a daughter is a high-class position

20
00:00:39.366 --> 00:00:41.000
You actually called migrant workers

21
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.366
Are you trying to insult me?

22
00:00:42.366 --> 00:00:43.500
You shameless

23
00:00:43.666 --> 00:00:45.200
My Tang family is shameless

24
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.066
Did I persuade Aoxue not to marry him long ago?

25
00:00:48.066 --> 00:00:50.666
Are you saying he's not your crown prince?

26
00:00:50.666 --> 00:00:52.866
Who knew he would end up like this?

27
00:00:52.866 --> 00:00:55.533
Oh dear mother, just calm down

28
00:00:55.533 --> 00:00:57.066
Nonsense, he is also a kind heart

29
00:00:57.066 --> 00:00:58.200
Think of the big day.

30
00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:59.700
I called some more people over

31
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:01.200
Those are his good friends

32
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.766
Don't care too much

33
00:01:02.866 --> 00:01:03.666
No way.

34
00:01:04.266 --> 00:01:05.900
Today it's your leg's debt

35
00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:07.366
Don't get married

36
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.033
Forget it, I said

37
00:01:11.566 --> 00:01:12.700
We are indeed long

38
00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:14.900
We have a lot of reason

39
00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:16.500
There we go.

40
00:01:17.333 --> 00:01:19.166
Wait don't go
