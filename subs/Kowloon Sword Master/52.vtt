00:00:00.466 --> 00:00:03.800
What? How? How?

2
00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.900
Xiao Tang, just now you called Mr. Li avant-garde kung fu

3
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.100
You split

4
00:00:11.866 --> 00:00:12.666
Yes

5
00:00:14.366 --> 00:00:16.000
We have broken up.

6
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.166
Mr. Li has the talent of this world

7
00:00:18.166 --> 00:00:19.366
Heaven Swallowing Art

8
00:00:19.366 --> 00:00:21.600
But I love you so much

9
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:22.800
Lose your life

10
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.633
You didn't grasp him well

11
00:00:26.133 --> 00:00:28.200
They're going to fall!

12
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.700
Do it yourself

13
00:00:33.333 --> 00:00:35.533
Who are you?

14
00:00:35.533 --> 00:00:37.733
Why is there so much energy?

15
00:00:37.733 --> 00:00:39.400
Now you believe what I'm saying is true

16
00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.700
I gave you everything you have, right?

17
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.666
You still think I'm not good enough for you

18
00:00:43.666 --> 00:00:45.066
Do you look down on me?

19
00:00:45.066 --> 00:00:47.900
But if you're really that good

20
00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:49.600
Why did you become the wife of the Li family?

21
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.800
Why did you end up selling fried noodles on the street?

22
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.100
Why are you helping me openly?

23
00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.666
I've known you for 10 years

24
00:00:56.666 --> 00:00:58.300
Yes. What's wrong?

25
00:00:58.333 --> 00:00:59.300
You know

26
00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.700
Why did I confess to you only 5 years ago?

27
00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:02.533
Why is that?

28
00:01:02.533 --> 00:01:05.566
Because I found you because of the end of the Tang family

29
00:01:05.566 --> 00:01:07.966
You and your parents have been discriminated against

30
00:01:07.966 --> 00:01:10.166
At that time, you felt very inferior in your heart

31
00:01:10.166 --> 00:01:11.333
Very insecure

32
00:01:11.333 --> 00:01:13.500
You've always said that it's good to marry an ordinary person

33
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.066
Just be nice to you.

34
00:01:15.466 --> 00:01:16.533
Until five years ago.

35
00:01:16.533 --> 00:01:18.500
I found the innocence in your heart

36
00:01:18.533 --> 00:01:21.566
So I mustered up the courage to confess to you

37
00:01:21.566 --> 00:01:23.700
But you still say you don't deserve me

38
00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:24.766
Fear of losing me

39
00:01:24.766 --> 00:01:27.466
I want you not to live in that sense of insecurity

40
00:01:27.466 --> 00:01:28.300
So

41
00:01:28.366 --> 00:01:30.866
I took the opportunity of Li Sihai to banish me

42
00:01:30.866 --> 00:01:31.800
Left the Li family

43
00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.100
While being an ordinary person

44
00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.566
While secretly helping you achieve you

45
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.133
I just didn't think of it.

46
00:01:38.133 --> 00:01:39.500
After you have achieved something

47
00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.166
You swell high above

48
00:01:41.166 --> 00:01:42.600
Look down on me
