00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.000
Mr. Li by my side

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.500
The one you should congratulate today

3
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.866
Lord Jianzun, the owner of Kowloon Shop

4
00:00:06.866 --> 00:00:08.800
What is he, the sword lord?

5
00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:09.400
Lord Zudu

6
00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:10.200
Don't trust him.

7
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.600
He's an impostor.

8
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:14.300
It's the Security Bureau who's here to arrest him, and he's still pretending to be here

9
00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:15.333
You should know

10
00:00:15.333 --> 00:00:17.600
You came to congratulate Mr. Li today.

11
00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.200
Is it the sword lord?

12
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.866
Well, he kept calling you Lord Governor

13
00:00:22.866 --> 00:00:23.133
you

14
00:00:23.133 --> 00:00:26.200
Do you think the real Sword Lord would be so humble?

15
00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:27.266
That's true.

16
00:00:27.266 --> 00:00:28.500
What the hell is going on?

17
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:29.700
Who am I?

18
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:32.200
One phone call and you'll know who it is

19
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.033
Hello angel

20
00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.566
I called you, Lord Zunshi

21
00:00:42.566 --> 00:00:45.666
It was you who requested to attend the wedding of Lord Jianzun

22
00:00:45.666 --> 00:00:48.266
In order to avoid exposing the identity of the Sword Lord

23
00:00:48.266 --> 00:00:50.666
I'll match you with Mr. Lee

24
00:00:50.666 --> 00:00:51.900
And you know what?

25
00:00:52.066 --> 00:00:53.166
Yes, yes, people are just blossoming

26
00:00:53.166 --> 00:00:55.600
Zhang Yongkang pays tribute to Lord Jianzun

27
00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:58.733
Finally, there is a person with an IQ online

28
00:00:58.733 --> 00:01:01.033
Get up, Mr. Xie Jianzun

29
00:01:01.366 --> 00:01:03.466
This sheriff is me impersonating

30
00:01:03.466 --> 00:01:05.900
What do you think should be done to arrest me?

31
00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:07.166
How dare you catch Lord Jincun?

32
00:01:07.166 --> 00:01:08.866
I don't want to live anymore, go back and remove him

33
00:01:08.866 --> 00:01:10.700
Make him want to be my adult

34
00:01:10.933 --> 00:01:11.733
Forgive me.

35
00:01:11.733 --> 00:01:14.200
I also came to check the situation after receiving the call.

36
00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.133
Oh, it's all him.

37
00:01:15.133 --> 00:01:16.066
It's all his fault

38
00:01:16.066 --> 00:01:18.466
Why did you slander the Sword Lord?

39
00:01:18.466 --> 00:01:19.600
No, Governor

40
00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:20.766
He was really an impostor.

41
00:01:20.766 --> 00:01:22.733
Don't listen to what that woman has to say.

42
00:01:22.733 --> 00:01:25.066
None of us here believe it
