00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:01.200
So...

2
00:00:01.266 --> 00:00:03.800
Mr. Li Wushuang, do you have anything else to say?

3
00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:05.333
You say you are the phoenix among people

4
00:00:05.333 --> 00:00:06.933
And I am a cement pond without cement.

5
00:00:06.933 --> 00:00:08.866
I don't even deserve to give you leather shoes

6
00:00:08.866 --> 00:00:10.166
Isn't it?

7
00:00:10.166 --> 00:00:11.766
You probably don't know

8
00:00:11.766 --> 00:00:14.166
Everything you have is given to you by me

9
00:00:14.166 --> 00:00:16.866
Although in your eyes I am just a small street vendor

10
00:00:16.866 --> 00:00:19.133
But I am no ordinary street vendor.

11
00:00:19.133 --> 00:00:21.733
My true identity is too big to imagine

12
00:00:21.733 --> 00:00:24.333
Worth your lifetime of awe and admiration

13
00:00:24.333 --> 00:00:26.133
Enough, I've already kicked you.

14
00:00:26.133 --> 00:00:27.800
Is it funny for you to brag like that?

15
00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.066
You think you've blown it?

16
00:00:29.066 --> 00:00:30.333
You can get your piece back

17
00:00:30.333 --> 00:00:31.600
Poor self-esteem?

18
00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.300
An incompetent and unmotivated person like you

19
00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:35.800
Deserves to be abandoned

20
00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.066
Deserved the greatest humiliation of my life

21
00:00:38.066 --> 00:00:39.400
Deserved to never lift my head

22
00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:40.900
Become everyone's joke

23
00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:42.800
Humph is reduced to everyone's smile

24
00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:43.900
not egotism

25
00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:45.500
All of you here today

26
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.366
Which one is qualified to see my jokes?

27
00:00:47.366 --> 00:00:48.400
My Big Brother

28
00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.700
You really like to deceive yourself, don't you?

29
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:51.666
How dare you say

30
00:00:51.666 --> 00:00:54.833
Of all the people here today, who dares to laugh at you?

31
00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:56.400
What a joke

32
00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.733
You are a street vendor selling fried noodles

33
00:00:58.733 --> 00:01:02.066
Which one do you say dares not laugh at you?

34
00:01:02.066 --> 00:01:05.166
Second Young Master, there is nothing wrong with what he said

35
00:01:05.166 --> 00:01:06.600
Oh, it does?

36
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.166
Look at these migrant workers he hired today

37
00:01:09.166 --> 00:01:11.100
All hillbillies like him

38
00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.533
Who can look down on him?

39
00:01:12.533 --> 00:01:13.866
Hahaha too

40
00:01:13.866 --> 00:01:14.766
I say

41
00:01:14.766 --> 00:01:17.133
Why do you have to invite these migrant workers over?

42
00:01:17.133 --> 00:01:20.100
It turns out that it's just a foil

43
00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:20.933
This boss

44
00:01:20.933 --> 00:01:22.000
Although we are migrant workers

45
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.166
But I didn't eat your food?

46
00:01:23.166 --> 00:01:25.100
Don't humiliate people by opening your mouth, okay?

47
00:01:26.066 --> 00:01:27.400
Oh, it does?

48
00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.266
Did you say I humiliated you?

49
00:01:29.266 --> 00:01:31.066
Isn't that what you mean?

50
00:01:31.533 --> 00:01:33.766
Is it hahaha

51
00:01:35.533 --> 00:01:37.166
So what if I humiliate you?

52
00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.200
What if I hit you?
