00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:03.200
Hmph, you're done, sheriff, here

2
00:00:05.166 --> 00:00:06.900
Who is dying?

3
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:10.633
He actually dared to pretend to be Lord Sword Master. It was him

4
00:00:11.366 --> 00:00:13.566
You pretend to be the sword lord

5
00:00:13.566 --> 00:00:14.800
Adults do not

6
00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:17.333
My son is stressed out at work and forced to get married

7
00:00:17.333 --> 00:00:19.700
So all kinds of pressure made him talk nonsense

8
00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:21.100
Please forgive him this time

9
00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:22.400
Are you kidding me?

10
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.600
Pretending to be Lord Sword Master can still forgive

11
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.133
The boy was taught by the teacher

12
00:00:26.133 --> 00:00:27.800
Why impersonate the sword lord?

13
00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.266
I've said it many times

14
00:00:29.266 --> 00:00:30.333
I am the sword lord

15
00:00:30.333 --> 00:00:31.566
I don't want to say more

16
00:00:31.566 --> 00:00:32.966
Look at your virtue

17
00:00:32.966 --> 00:00:34.666
It looks like a Ming palace at first glance

18
00:00:34.666 --> 00:00:37.000
You also dare to impersonate the sword lord and my people

19
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.433
He's just a street vendor selling fried noodles.

20
00:00:39.666 --> 00:00:42.400
You see, those are his lowest Gu Yong

21
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:43.666
It's hateful

22
00:00:43.666 --> 00:00:46.466
A mere small vendor dares to impersonate Sword Lord

23
00:00:46.466 --> 00:00:47.766
Come and catch

24
00:00:47.866 --> 00:00:49.766
I see who dares to move

25
00:00:51.966 --> 00:00:53.566
Who are you? What do you want?

26
00:00:53.566 --> 00:00:57.666
I am Shi Xuanfeng, the Jiulong Temple Master under Sword Master

27
00:00:57.666 --> 00:01:00.966
Hahahaha, are you still pretending to be a group?

28
00:01:00.966 --> 00:01:04.300
Say something else, just say Xuanfeng Zun is at least 50 years old

29
00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:05.200
High ranking

30
00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.900
And you don't look early enough to pretend

31
00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:09.533
Now I can be sure

32
00:01:09.533 --> 00:01:11.366
They're all impostors.

33
00:01:11.366 --> 00:01:13.100
Hmph old man

34
00:01:23.366 --> 00:01:25.266
Governor, why are you here?
