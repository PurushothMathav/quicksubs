00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:01.933
You migrant worker, what the hell did you do?

2
00:00:01.933 --> 00:00:03.600
Don't say I'll call the police to arrest you

3
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.066
Oh my mother

4
00:00:05.066 --> 00:00:06.700
Our house burns mountains just for fun

5
00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:07.866
Don't take it personally.

6
00:00:07.866 --> 00:00:08.800
He puts up a street stall every day

7
00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:11.266
How can I have time to spy on you? Do you think it is?

8
00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:12.666
I said you are setting up a stall every day

9
00:00:12.666 --> 00:00:13.733
We can all not testify

10
00:00:13.733 --> 00:00:14.533
Yes

11
00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:15.866
Stall every day

12
00:00:15.866 --> 00:00:17.433
Even in the middle of the night, mom

13
00:00:23.133 --> 00:00:24.466
Mom, what's wrong?

14
00:00:24.466 --> 00:00:26.266
Aoxue, I told you

15
00:00:26.266 --> 00:00:28.133
People who integrate into the bottom can't get married

16
00:00:28.133 --> 00:00:28.866
You don't believe

17
00:00:28.866 --> 00:00:31.166
He actually installed a monitor in our house

18
00:00:31.166 --> 00:00:31.966
Voyeur

19
00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:33.200
What!

20
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.500
You bumped into the monitor at my house, you can eat rice indiscriminately

21
00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:36.533
Don't talk nonsense

22
00:00:36.533 --> 00:00:38.366
Then how do you explain my cirrhosis?

23
00:00:38.366 --> 00:00:39.866
I can see it from your face

24
00:00:39.866 --> 00:00:41.800
And you don't just have cirrhosis

25
00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.000
Still less sperm and irregular menstruation

26
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.666
Sometimes it takes half a month to come.

27
00:00:45.666 --> 00:00:47.100
Sometimes three or four months

28
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.666
The old Chinese medicine doctor prescribed you a lot of medicine to treat palace cold

29
00:00:49.666 --> 00:00:50.800
Bag but it didn't work

30
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.866
You have severe abdominal pain as soon as your period arrives

31
00:00:52.866 --> 00:00:54.933
Then the breast pain is worse than death

32
00:00:54.933 --> 00:00:56.466
Am I right?

33
00:00:57.133 --> 00:00:58.133
How do you know that?

34
00:00:58.133 --> 00:01:00.300
Because I am good at the art of the emperor

35
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.066
Is it curable?

36
00:01:02.066 --> 00:01:03.100
If it can be cured

37
00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:04.900
I won't bother with you about this today

38
00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.333
When I see a doctor and save a life, it's always about my mood

39
00:01:07.333 --> 00:01:09.333
No one has ever bargained

40
00:01:09.333 --> 00:01:10.866
Tiqiao has seen enough Liu Shuang

41
00:01:10.866 --> 00:01:11.700
Don't take your

42
00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.866
Take out the nasty Jianghu version of the play to deceive people

43
00:01:13.866 --> 00:01:15.200
You have to think I'm lying

44
00:01:15.466 --> 00:01:15.933
Then forget it.

45
00:01:15.933 --> 00:01:17.933
Don't ask me then.

46
00:01:17.933 --> 00:01:19.000
Let's not talk about that.

47
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.833
Who invited these nasty migrant workers?
