00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:02.133
I said it's really blind to your dog's eyes

2
00:00:02.133 --> 00:00:03.966
Even the master doesn't know the master anymore

3
00:00:03.966 --> 00:00:04.733
Whose owner?

4
00:00:04.733 --> 00:00:07.600
You said you were here to party with me today

5
00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:08.666
I booked all the hotels

6
00:00:08.666 --> 00:00:09.566
Not who I am

7
00:00:09.566 --> 00:00:11.166
You really think of yourself as a person

8
00:00:11.166 --> 00:00:13.900
Who doesn't know that the second young master is the heir of the Li family?

9
00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:14.466
you

10
00:00:14.466 --> 00:00:17.200
Just a small street vendor who was quit by the rich and powerful

11
00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.133
What right do you have to speak here?

12
00:00:19.133 --> 00:00:20.400
Don't talk nonsense with him

13
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.200
Catch him first and then go back and clean him up

14
00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:24.633
Someone is coming

15
00:00:24.666 --> 00:00:26.100
Hey girls

16
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:28.100
Whoever dares to cause no harm, let's fight hard

17
00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:28.966
Yeah, why fight?

18
00:00:28.966 --> 00:00:30.200
There is nothing light on our mountain

19
00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.700
The floor is humble and promises not to be bullied by you casually.

20
00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.833
Second Young Master, you group of dirt

21
00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.000
Are you going to have a hard time with me?

22
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.333
Unparalleled Kesi's dear brother

23
00:00:39.333 --> 00:00:41.900
You took his computing seat and stole his wife

24
00:00:41.933 --> 00:00:43.266
And eat it clean

25
00:00:43.266 --> 00:00:44.200
There is no such reason in the world

26
00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.300
You bunch of local chickens

27
00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.600
What right do you have to reason with me here?

28
00:00:48.733 --> 00:00:50.966
Okay, since you are willing to die

29
00:00:50.966 --> 00:00:52.400
Then I will fulfill you

30
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:53.500
You wait for me.

31
00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.466
I will call the people on the page to pick you up now.

32
00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.300
Butcher, I was beaten

33
00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.733
Please find some brothers to come to the imperial building.

34
00:01:05.733 --> 00:01:06.533
Thanks.

35
00:01:11.166 --> 00:01:12.766
You wait for me.

36
00:01:12.966 --> 00:01:14.900
Butcher will be here soon

37
00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:18.233
We'll see how you die
