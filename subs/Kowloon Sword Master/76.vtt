1
00:00:03.566 --> 00:00:04.366
What!

2
00:00:05.933 --> 00:00:07.600
OK, I see.

3
00:00:08.333 --> 00:00:09.266
What's up?

4
00:00:11.066 --> 00:00:13.333
Xuan Feng, go down to dinner with my mother first

5
00:00:13.333 --> 00:00:14.800
I'm going out with Bing Yao to chat about something

6
00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:18.866
It was Xuefeng who helped me bring the crown back

7
00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:33.900
What's up?

8
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:35.800
Pluto issues final collaboration with the enemy

9
00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.733
If you don't agree within 12 hours

10
00:00:37.733 --> 00:00:39.800
The North Gate will cease to exist

11
00:00:39.933 --> 00:00:42.333
What is the Nordic Pluto doing with the Nordic giants?

12
00:00:42.333 --> 00:00:44.300
They opened up to every big house.

13
00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:45.566
Trillions in protection money

14
00:00:45.566 --> 00:00:47.700
In fact, I just want to enter the main building

15
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.266
Let the wealthy become their wealthy

16
00:00:49.266 --> 00:00:51.666
Funding its terrorist forces in northern Europe

17
00:00:51.666 --> 00:00:52.966
You came to see me a few days ago

18
00:00:52.966 --> 00:00:54.733
I'm afraid the marriage proposal is fake

19
00:00:54.733 --> 00:00:55.866
Is it true to ask for my help?

20
00:00:55.866 --> 00:00:57.866
It's true that I don't ask you for help

21
00:00:57.866 --> 00:00:59.166
But I like you more

22
00:00:59.166 --> 00:01:00.666
From you on the Nordic Great Wall

23
00:01:00.666 --> 00:01:02.466
Destroyed the Night King's Skeleton Army

24
00:01:02.466 --> 00:01:04.300
Announce the beginning of the rise of Kowloon Hall

25
00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:07.566
I already like you, don't worry.

26
00:01:07.866 --> 00:01:08.800
I'll figure it out.

27
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.000
What are you going to do?

28
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.766
I'll talk to Hades first

29
00:01:15.533 --> 00:01:18.433
Give me Hades' contact information in a minute

30
00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:21.300
Don't worry, the Zhang family will be fine

31
00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.066
I know my dad said

32
00:01:23.066 --> 00:01:26.500
The only one who can stop Hades is you

33
00:01:26.733 --> 00:01:29.300
It's true that Hades is evil

34
00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:31.400
His men are also suicide bombers

35
00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.066
Even the heads of state have asked them to be afraid of three points

36
00:01:34.066 --> 00:01:36.100
But it's not a problem for me.

37
00:01:36.866 --> 00:01:38.466
Let me talk to Hades first
