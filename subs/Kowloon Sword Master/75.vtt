00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.966
No need to apologize

2
00:00:01.966 --> 00:00:03.966
You have always looked down on my migrant worker brothers

3
00:00:03.966 --> 00:00:05.800
The arrogance of a rich man everywhere

4
00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:06.600
sin

5
00:00:06.766 --> 00:00:09.800
Then swap your assets and identities

6
00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:10.600
OK

7
00:00:12.133 --> 00:00:13.366
Dare to disobey

8
00:00:13.366 --> 00:00:14.400
Yun Chen died

9
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:15.266
We would like to

10
00:00:15.266 --> 00:00:16.766
We do.

11
00:00:16.766 --> 00:00:18.666
Come on guys

12
00:00:18.666 --> 00:00:19.800
Pick any wealthy family

13
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.200
Except for wife and children

14
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:24.666
Change the rest of the car, house and deposit, right?

15
00:00:24.666 --> 00:00:27.333
Don't brush, don't witness, what's wrong?

16
00:00:27.333 --> 00:00:28.400
Is what you said true?

17
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:29.533
Don't ask me to see you

18
00:00:29.533 --> 00:00:30.600
Just call me Peerless

19
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:31.500
You know.

20
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:32.600
I always say the same

21
00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.500
You should have heard of my legend

22
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.533
I'm good at making ordinary people into myths

23
00:00:36.533 --> 00:00:37.700
Any ordinary person

24
00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:38.800
As long as I am willing to help

25
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.333
Can you turn him into the most dazzling myth?

26
00:00:41.333 --> 00:00:43.233
Seven Star Peerless Ah Seven Star Peerless

27
00:00:43.333 --> 00:00:45.900
Today is my wedding day after all

28
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:46.866
Say something happy

29
00:00:46.866 --> 00:00:49.133
Miss Beidu Jiang Family is both talented and beautiful

30
00:00:49.133 --> 00:00:50.066
Won my heart

31
00:00:50.066 --> 00:00:51.133
From today onwards

32
00:00:51.133 --> 00:00:52.300
He is my man

33
00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:54.133
His business is my business

34
00:00:54.133 --> 00:00:56.566
Bosses from all over the world have the opportunity

35
00:00:56.666 --> 00:00:58.400
Help him and Jiang Jia more

36
00:00:58.533 --> 00:01:00.866
Okay, after all this delay

37
00:01:00.933 --> 00:01:02.066
Everybody's hungry.

38
00:01:02.066 --> 00:01:06.100
Let's start the party hahahahahaha

39
00:01:06.666 --> 00:01:09.233
Mom, let's go eat first, Uncle Wu

40
00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.733
Are you really the great Lord Jian Zun?

41
00:01:11.733 --> 00:01:12.933
It's time for this

42
00:01:12.933 --> 00:01:14.466
Why don't you trust your son?

43
00:01:14.466 --> 00:01:16.666
No, no, I don't believe it.

44
00:01:16.666 --> 00:01:18.666
Happiness comes too fast

45
00:01:18.666 --> 00:01:21.233
Son you are amazing

46
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:24.833
