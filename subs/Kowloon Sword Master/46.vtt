00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:01.466
He didn't lie to me.

2
00:00:01.466 --> 00:00:03.866
It's you who are blind and can't recognize the real dragon

3
00:00:03.866 --> 00:00:06.666
Impossible. He's a small vendor selling fried noodles.

4
00:00:06.666 --> 00:00:07.866
How could it be a real dragon?

5
00:00:07.866 --> 00:00:09.766
Like you said yourself

6
00:00:09.966 --> 00:00:11.666
What did you do?

7
00:00:11.666 --> 00:00:13.866
He lied to him about the Wanshou Talisman and Miss Jiang

8
00:00:13.866 --> 00:00:16.100
Perhaps your stupidity lies in

9
00:00:16.133 --> 00:00:18.533
These people are a thousand times more powerful than you

10
00:00:18.533 --> 00:00:19.533
You don't believe it

11
00:00:19.533 --> 00:00:22.966
Do you think they would be dumber than you at their height?

12
00:00:23.133 --> 00:00:25.333
Ok ok I see

13
00:00:25.333 --> 00:00:26.433
You are unwilling

14
00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:27.766
What!

15
00:00:28.466 --> 00:00:31.366
I can't believe you think you're a real dragon

16
00:00:31.366 --> 00:00:34.433
If you tell too many lies, you will believe them.

17
00:00:34.533 --> 00:00:36.966
Birds of a feather flock together.

18
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.400
People in groups

19
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.366
Look at who you are with

20
00:00:41.366 --> 00:00:43.200
Stay with your legs

21
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.800
You say you are a real dragon

22
00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:48.300
Who believes it, it doesn't matter if you don't believe it

23
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.900
The game has just begun

24
00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:51.233
Let's take our time

25
00:00:51.266 --> 00:00:52.500
You will believe it slowly

26
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.066
Mr. Li, ignore this stupid woman.

27
00:00:55.066 --> 00:00:56.666
Please promise my proposal

28
00:00:56.666 --> 00:00:58.300
I will be with you for the rest of my life

29
00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.666
Treat you a thousand times better than this stupid woman

30
00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.200
Miss Jiang sincerely asks Mr. Li to fulfill it

31
00:01:06.333 --> 00:01:08.033
Ask Mr. Li to agree

32
00:01:08.566 --> 00:01:11.666
Mom, what do you think of this wife?

33
00:01:11.666 --> 00:01:13.266
This is not

34
00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:15.366
Is that true?

35
00:01:15.366 --> 00:01:16.766
I'm not dreaming

36
00:01:16.766 --> 00:01:17.933
You are not dreaming

37
00:01:17.933 --> 00:01:19.233
As long as you like

38
00:01:19.533 --> 00:01:21.000
I will marry him home

39
00:01:22.333 --> 00:01:24.433
Oh, great.

40
00:01:24.566 --> 00:01:26.866
Great, thanks auntie.

41
00:01:27.733 --> 00:01:30.166
Mr. Li, what do you mean?

42
00:01:30.166 --> 00:01:32.800
Okay, I also understand

43
00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.066
It's true that there was no better woman than you at that time

44
00:01:36.066 --> 00:01:38.366
I will promise your proposal today.
