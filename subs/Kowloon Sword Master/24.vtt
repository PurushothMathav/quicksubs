WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.400
The hotel is set by me

2
00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:02.733
I have the final say here

3
00:00:02.733 --> 00:00:04.266
Whoever dares to look down on you

4
00:00:04.266 --> 00:00:05.733
That's my enemy.

5
00:00:05.733 --> 00:00:08.066
What? Your enemy?

6
00:00:08.066 --> 00:00:08.933
Then break up

7
00:00:08.933 --> 00:00:09.966
This marriage is over

8
00:00:09.966 --> 00:00:12.966
You can marry these cats and dogs, right?

9
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.166
This grave is over

10
00:00:14.166 --> 00:00:15.866
I'll call Aoxue right away

11
00:00:15.866 --> 00:00:17.400
Hurry up and hit oops

12
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.166
In-law, calm down

13
00:00:19.166 --> 00:00:20.166
Don't be impulsive

14
00:00:20.166 --> 00:00:21.533
Have something to say?

15
00:00:21.533 --> 00:00:22.466
Say a string of words

16
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.600
You don't take a mirror to yourself

17
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:25.366
What's that?

18
00:00:25.366 --> 00:00:28.233
It's a homeless dog who's been swept out

19
00:00:28.266 --> 00:00:30.600
What qualifications do I have to make me run away and become a clamor?

20
00:00:32.966 --> 00:00:33.766
What!

21
00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:35.900
Still want to die

22
00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.466
I'll be right there. Hmm.

23
00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.766
Nonsense, hurry up and apologize to your uncle and aunt

24
00:00:41.766 --> 00:00:44.966
Mom, they bully and insult people first

25
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.466
Why should I apologize?

26
00:00:46.533 --> 00:00:49.133
Oh, why are you so stubborn?

27
00:00:49.133 --> 00:00:50.966
This is a lifetime hope

28
00:00:50.966 --> 00:00:53.433
Hey, let me apologize

29
00:00:54.266 --> 00:00:55.466
Ah, Mr. Tang.

30
00:00:55.766 --> 00:00:56.733
Sorry.

31
00:00:56.733 --> 00:00:59.866
It's us, it's better if you say it, don't worry about Wushuang

32
00:00:59.866 --> 00:01:02.933
It's not your fault that we made these kinds of big ones.

33
00:01:02.933 --> 00:01:04.000
What do you apologize for?

34
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.100
Oops, unparalleled

35
00:01:05.733 --> 00:01:07.133
We all know you are a good person.

36
00:01:07.133 --> 00:01:09.700
It's your chance to marry Miss Tan too

37
00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.866
We all hope you have a good future.

38
00:01:11.866 --> 00:01:13.100
You will be rich later.

39
00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.300
Don't pretend to be our brothers in the future

40
00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:16.700
Don't count on it.

41
00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.400
I have already called Aoxue.

42
00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.600
He will come to deal with the Wei wife immediately.

43
00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.333
Regret it yourself

44
00:01:23.333 --> 00:01:24.900
It's not getting married, is it?

45
00:01:25.133 --> 00:01:27.166
Okay, let's end it then.

46
00:01:27.166 --> 00:01:29.666
Mom, let's go, go away

47
00:01:30.966 --> 00:01:32.600
Stay put

48
00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.666
The wedding continues haha
