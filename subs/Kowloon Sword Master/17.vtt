1
00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.333
And you all know that.

2
00:00:01.333 --> 00:00:02.500
My two sons

3
00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:03.466
Unrivaled

4
00:00:03.466 --> 00:00:05.966
After reading the book, I have been selling fried noodles on the street

5
00:00:05.966 --> 00:00:08.100
It is said that the cost of fried noodles is 5 yuan.

6
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:09.400
He only sells them for a dollar a piece.

7
00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:11.500
It's just a joke of our Li family

8
00:00:11.566 --> 00:00:12.466
Second winter festival

9
00:00:12.466 --> 00:00:15.166
I have been managing the company in the group for these years

10
00:00:15.166 --> 00:00:17.466
It can be called young and promising

11
00:00:17.466 --> 00:00:18.733
But as a father

12
00:00:18.733 --> 00:00:20.100
Will never protect anyone

13
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.800
Calling you today

14
00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.200
Is to vote on this heir

15
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.100
What do you think?

16
00:00:26.166 --> 00:00:27.500
I support Dad's decision

17
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.300
Although my ability and reputation are higher than those of my eldest brother

18
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.766
But he is my eldest brother after all

19
00:00:31.866 --> 00:00:32.566
So

20
00:00:32.566 --> 00:00:35.300
It is still based on the opinions of uncles and uncles

21
00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.066
Chairperson and Dongjie

22
00:00:37.066 --> 00:00:38.366
Really open-minded

23
00:00:38.366 --> 00:00:39.700
Look ahead.

24
00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:42.166
Yes, Dongjie, let me take a look.

25
00:00:42.166 --> 00:00:43.400
There are generals

26
00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.466
I also saw the future of the Li enterprise

27
00:00:45.466 --> 00:00:46.400
Lee's future

28
00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.166
What future do you think Li's has?

29
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.133
outrageous

30
00:00:50.133 --> 00:00:51.000
Li Wushuang

31
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.066
You're cursing yourself, aren't you?

32
00:00:53.066 --> 00:00:54.566
No consciousness.

33
00:00:54.566 --> 00:00:55.766
Do you count?

34
00:00:55.766 --> 00:00:58.066
Let you attend the heirs' meeting

35
00:00:58.066 --> 00:01:00.766
It is the greatest gift the chairperson has given you.

36
00:01:00.766 --> 00:01:03.366
You still speak rudely

37
00:01:03.366 --> 00:01:04.466
You people?

38
00:01:04.466 --> 00:01:06.033
Obviously full of it?

39
00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.466
But you have to pretend to be sanctimonious

40
00:01:08.466 --> 00:01:10.766
Are you being fair to people and things?

41
00:01:10.766 --> 00:01:12.500
Don't you have any hard numbers in your heart?

42
00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:13.566
What number is there?

43
00:01:13.566 --> 00:01:15.500
You stand where you are the boss

44
00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.866
I thought you could inherit it from you

45
00:01:17.866 --> 00:01:18.900
That's impossible.

46
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.466
Your family doesn't admit it.

47
00:01:20.466 --> 00:01:21.900
Trash handsome

48
00:01:22.066 --> 00:01:23.366
Does your home not exist?

49
00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.900
Oh yeah, I have one more thing.

50
00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.866
I forgot to tell my uncles and uncles

51
00:01:28.866 --> 00:01:29.566
So what's up?

52
00:01:29.566 --> 00:01:31.200
Dongjie just a few days ago

53
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.100
I got to know Lord Zunlong of Kowloon Group

54
00:01:34.166 --> 00:01:35.300
He said he would take care of me

55
00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:37.166
Once I take over the Lee heir

56
00:01:37.166 --> 00:01:39.266
It will definitely lead the Li family to take off

57
00:01:39.266 --> 00:01:40.166
Don't think about it.

58
00:01:40.166 --> 00:01:42.500
It is impossible for Kowloon Group to take care of Li's

59
00:01:42.566 --> 00:01:44.133
Kowloon Group does not care

60
00:01:44.133 --> 00:01:45.766
Could it be that you have the final say?

61
00:01:45.766 --> 00:01:48.100
You're right, it's me who has the final say
