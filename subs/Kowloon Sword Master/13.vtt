1
00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:01.233
Your dad is seriously ill

2
00:00:01.266 --> 00:00:02.266
critical

3
00:00:02.366 --> 00:00:04.200
Time is running out, so what?

4
00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.400
When he was in his prime, he was angry with you for marrying him

5
00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:07.966
What do you care about his life?

6
00:00:07.966 --> 00:00:09.733
Oh, you silly child

7
00:00:09.733 --> 00:00:10.933
You are the eldest son of the Li family

8
00:00:10.933 --> 00:00:13.066
Your dad is gone, you have the right to inherit

9
00:00:13.066 --> 00:00:14.166
I could hate your father

10
00:00:14.166 --> 00:00:16.266
But you don't have to suffer with mom

11
00:00:16.266 --> 00:00:17.133
Do you think so?

12
00:00:17.133 --> 00:00:18.566
I don't care anymore

13
00:00:18.566 --> 00:00:20.933
I don't care about your assets at all

14
00:00:20.933 --> 00:00:22.933
Oh, don't be so temperamental.

15
00:00:22.933 --> 00:00:24.000
After all, he is your father

16
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.666
You are a relative son who will die soon

17
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:28.800
You'd better go back and have a look. Let's go

18
00:00:34.166 --> 00:00:35.900
You sell fried noodles

19
00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:37.533
How dare you oppose me

20
00:00:37.533 --> 00:00:38.900
Could it be that you kill him?

21
00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:40.133
Don't be angry

22
00:00:40.133 --> 00:00:42.133
I will announce it at the wedding then

23
00:00:42.133 --> 00:00:43.000
You are the one

24
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.566
He'll make a fool of himself all over the city

25
00:00:44.566 --> 00:00:46.400
Wouldn't that be more exciting?

26
00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:47.400
Is that good?

27
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.600
I'm afraid he'll kill himself with shame

28
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:50.800
Doesn't he deserve it?

29
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.866
I've given him a chance to leave with dignity

30
00:00:52.866 --> 00:00:54.700
It was his toad who wanted to climb high

31
00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:55.733
In that case

32
00:00:55.733 --> 00:00:57.200
Then let him suffer this life

33
00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:58.666
The greatest humiliation

34
00:00:58.666 --> 00:00:59.466
Humph

35
00:00:59.733 --> 00:01:00.300
Yes!

36
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.300
I'm really looking forward to this wedding.

37
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.133
To marry his wife

38
00:01:05.133 --> 00:01:07.066
You can still watch his jokes

39
00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.400
Double happiness.

40
00:01:09.733 --> 00:01:12.500
It's not three happy births.

41
00:01:13.166 --> 00:01:14.000
What else is good?

42
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.000
When I come again

43
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.500
Received a call from Kowloon Group

44
00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.166
Said it would be on my wedding day

45
00:01:18.166 --> 00:01:19.766
About me to sign a trillion investment contract

46
00:01:19.766 --> 00:01:22.733
Wait until Mr. Tang gets the trillion-dollar investment from Kowloon Group

47
00:01:22.733 --> 00:01:24.666
Worshiped Lord Zunlong as a godfather

48
00:01:24.666 --> 00:01:26.333
Marrying the second young master

49
00:01:26.333 --> 00:01:29.700
By then, the auditorium and the two will be in full swing

50
00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.466
Looking up to it all my life, haha.

51
00:01:33.966 --> 00:01:36.666
Wang Chenying, how is my condition?

52
00:01:38.733 --> 00:01:42.833
Old family, your kidney with liver and kidney failure is really rare

53
00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:44.500
Is there anything I can do?

54
00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:45.566
If you want to save

55
00:01:45.566 --> 00:01:46.733
It has to be alone.

56
00:01:46.733 --> 00:01:49.733
Who? He is a legend who has shocked the world

57
00:01:49.733 --> 00:01:51.700
Kowloon shop owner Jianzun
