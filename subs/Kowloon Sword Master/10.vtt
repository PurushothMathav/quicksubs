00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:01.100
Alright, Li Wushuang

2
00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:02.366
Stop acting like a hooligan

3
00:00:02.366 --> 00:00:04.466
Just talk about what happened between us

4
00:00:04.466 --> 00:00:05.566
How are you going to solve it?

5
00:00:05.566 --> 00:00:07.333
You have to break up the engagement with me, don't you?

6
00:00:07.333 --> 00:00:08.600
Tang Aoxue is

7
00:00:09.133 --> 00:00:10.366
I can't ask for it.

8
00:00:10.366 --> 00:00:11.800
Then you slap yourself twice

9
00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.300
Call yourself an ungrateful villain

10
00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:15.266
Apologize to me again.

11
00:00:15.266 --> 00:00:16.533
I will break off the engagement with you

12
00:00:16.533 --> 00:00:17.900
Cut in two

13
00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:20.366
What do you want me to apologize to you?

14
00:00:20.366 --> 00:00:21.366
Are you crazy?

15
00:00:21.366 --> 00:00:24.166
Let Mr. Tang give you an apology for selling fried noodles on the street

16
00:00:24.166 --> 00:00:26.366
Brother, you have been kicked out of the family

17
00:00:26.366 --> 00:00:27.866
Reduced to the street selling fried noodles

18
00:00:27.866 --> 00:00:30.000
What dignity do you have? Take compensation.

19
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.100
Get out of here and find a village girl in the country

20
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:33.400
Live a lifetime

21
00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:34.533
Isn't he fragrant?

22
00:00:34.533 --> 00:00:35.733
What kind of bicycle do you want?

23
00:00:35.733 --> 00:00:38.133
If his IQ were half that

24
00:00:38.133 --> 00:00:40.166
It won't be reduced to selling fried noodles on the street

25
00:00:40.166 --> 00:00:41.000
Alright, Li Wushuang

26
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.200
I'll 5 million you

27
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:43.333
Squeeze out the engagement with me

28
00:00:43.333 --> 00:00:45.066
How about not owing each other?

29
00:00:45.066 --> 00:00:47.166
I said no compensation.

30
00:00:47.166 --> 00:00:48.333
I just want you to apologize.

31
00:00:48.333 --> 00:00:50.000
You have to get along with me, don't you?

32
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.200
Is it me who can't get along with you?

33
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:52.933
Back then, you Tang Jiaren were majestic, dear.

34
00:00:52.933 --> 00:00:54.400
I am the eldest prince of the Li family

35
00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.733
The engagement was made at that time

36
00:00:55.733 --> 00:00:56.900
You are grateful

37
00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:59.400
Now you're about to break the engagement

38
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.066
Isn't that treachery?

39
00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:02.500
Isn't that an apology?

40
00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:03.933
It was my treachery.

41
00:01:03.933 --> 00:01:06.066
Is it not that you are incapable?

42
00:01:06.066 --> 00:01:06.800
That is.

43
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.133
A man cannot make his woman happy

44
00:01:09.133 --> 00:01:10.833
Blame others for treachery

45
00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:12.700
It's really rubbish

46
00:01:13.133 --> 00:01:13.933
you

47
00:01:14.733 --> 00:01:15.566
Li Wushuang

48
00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.166
You still won't break the engagement with me, will you?

49
00:01:17.166 --> 00:01:19.266
Confused so what?
