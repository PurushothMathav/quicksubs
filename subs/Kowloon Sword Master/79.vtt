00:00:01.166 --> 00:00:01.966
Hello

2
00:00:03.333 --> 00:00:04.466
Pardon me?

3
00:00:07.366 --> 00:00:10.600
Tianzun, I am at odds with you

4
00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:13.100
What's wrong with the collection?

5
00:00:16.333 --> 00:00:17.666
For a while

6
00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:22.200
All underground forces in more than 300 countries around the world have been dispatched

7
00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.766
Blood I Hades Organization is on the street

8
00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:26.833
Within 7 hours

9
00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:29.066
Lost 300,000

10
00:00:29.066 --> 00:00:31.566
Brother, the sword is so strong

11
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.900
I first heard

12
00:00:34.366 --> 00:00:35.900
Jianzun is medical

13
00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:36.666
Finance

14
00:00:36.666 --> 00:00:39.900
Jianzun in various fields of scientific and technological underground forces

15
00:00:39.933 --> 00:00:41.766
I have my doubts.

16
00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.566
Now it seems

17
00:00:44.133 --> 00:00:45.766
What you said is true.

18
00:00:45.766 --> 00:00:48.166
A person becomes the sword lord of the underground world

19
00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.166
I can't imagine it.

20
00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.866
If you become a swordsman in every industry

21
00:00:52.966 --> 00:00:54.900
Isn't that God?

22
00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.066
Even if he is a god

23
00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.566
I will also make him the god of death

24
00:01:03.866 --> 00:01:06.433
Oh, the leader smashed the phone in anger

25
00:01:06.766 --> 00:01:09.566
Oh, okay, okay, okay.

26
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.000
The brother of the leader Lao Cao is looking for you

27
00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:15.300
Hello

28
00:01:16.133 --> 00:01:17.266
Pardon me?

29
00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.466
outrageous

30
00:01:23.166 --> 00:01:24.633
What happened to the leader

31
00:01:24.766 --> 00:01:27.866
A mysterious army marches into northern Europe

32
00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.233
Into our lair

33
00:01:30.866 --> 00:01:33.200
Kill all my earth

34
00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:34.566
The building is so good

35
00:01:34.966 --> 00:01:36.566
I didn't expect it.

36
00:01:37.666 --> 00:01:39.666
He is just a Kowloon Hall

37
00:01:40.066 --> 00:01:43.400
There are troops with higher combat power than the regular army

38
00:01:43.466 --> 00:01:46.100
And it's tougher than Lao Tzu

39
00:01:46.266 --> 00:01:47.966
So what do we do now?

40
00:01:49.966 --> 00:01:52.633
Don't be afraid, I still have cards

41
00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:56.433
Can you make him hold the handrail?

42
00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:00.400
Show me your cards
