00:00:00.466 --> 00:00:02.600
Do you still accept fate and reality?

2
00:00:02.766 --> 00:00:05.133
Stop messing around here

3
00:00:05.133 --> 00:00:06.466
You say I'm messing up

4
00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:07.666
Isn't it?

5
00:00:07.666 --> 00:00:08.600
If he is

6
00:00:08.933 --> 00:00:11.900
I can understand your reality and your power.

7
00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:12.766
Because of people

8
00:00:12.766 --> 00:00:15.133
There is always vanity and selfishness

9
00:00:15.133 --> 00:00:16.433
But if you are blind

10
00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.066
Then I really look down on you

11
00:00:18.066 --> 00:00:19.800
Obviously you repented first

12
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.566
Li Dongjie insulted me later

13
00:00:21.566 --> 00:00:23.900
I'm just teaching you how to be human by the way

14
00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:25.133
What's wrong?

15
00:00:25.133 --> 00:00:26.466
You said you didn't make trouble.

16
00:00:27.133 --> 00:00:29.600
Who invited these migrant workers?

17
00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:30.966
I invited them.

18
00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:32.500
They're my brothers.

19
00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.866
Is there a problem with me treating them to a wedding wine?

20
00:00:34.866 --> 00:00:36.066
Of course there is a problem.

21
00:00:36.066 --> 00:00:40.033
What's the problem because they don't deserve him to choose

22
00:00:40.533 --> 00:00:42.000
Put away your arrogance

23
00:00:42.066 --> 00:00:45.166
Really, the way you look makes me feel sad.

24
00:00:45.266 --> 00:00:46.166
What!

25
00:00:46.766 --> 00:00:48.366
You think I'm pathetic?

26
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.666
I used 5 years to call it Yuncheng

27
00:00:51.666 --> 00:00:53.700
A hot new track in business

28
00:00:53.733 --> 00:00:55.366
A billionaire CEO

29
00:00:55.366 --> 00:00:57.966
You, a brick carrier, think I'm pathetic.

30
00:00:57.966 --> 00:00:59.666
Want two petals of Tang Aoxue

31
00:00:59.666 --> 00:01:01.100
If Mr. Li hadn't helped you

32
00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.566
You still don't know which street sells stinky tofu.

33
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.900
What? You said he helped me?

34
00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:06.900
What do you think?

35
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.333
Do you think that with your own

36
00:01:08.333 --> 00:01:09.933
Can you get everything?

37
00:01:09.933 --> 00:01:10.400
actually

38
00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.866
It's all just a deliberate arrangement by Mr. Li

39
00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:17.200
Crazy, crazy, I'm incompetent

40
00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.100
I actually want to take the credit for this

41
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.500
It's disgusting.

42
00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.033
Thousand hands holding a knife

43
00:01:30.866 --> 00:01:33.033
Master Hao is here, you are dead
