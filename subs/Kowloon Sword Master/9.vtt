00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:09.866
If you don't regret it, then promise to break the engagement?

2
00:00:09.866 --> 00:00:11.833
Master Dongjie, Second Master

3
00:00:14.866 --> 00:00:16.133
My good big brother

4
00:00:16.133 --> 00:00:18.566
You don't have to be a joke.

5
00:00:18.566 --> 00:00:20.866
Why is it a joke to let others join you?

6
00:00:20.866 --> 00:00:21.500
Pardon me?

7
00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.500
I said Aoxue

8
00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:24.600
A girl?

9
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.766
Finally with beauty and wisdom

10
00:00:26.766 --> 00:00:28.400
Achieve success in business

11
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.200
You sell fried noodles on the street

12
00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.400
Let's make our Li family a joke

13
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.366
Why implicate people?

14
00:00:34.366 --> 00:00:36.200
Take the initiative to write the marriage contract

15
00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.366
It's also a respectability for yourself

16
00:00:38.366 --> 00:00:39.666
That's not good.

17
00:00:39.666 --> 00:00:40.733
It's between me and him

18
00:00:40.733 --> 00:00:41.666
And what do you have?

19
00:00:42.133 --> 00:00:44.400
You are the prince of the Li family

20
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:45.933
My good big brother

21
00:00:45.933 --> 00:00:48.000
Of course you care about me

22
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:48.933
He also said that

23
00:00:48.933 --> 00:00:51.333
Kowloon Group's trillion-dollar investment in Mr. Tang

24
00:00:51.333 --> 00:00:52.400
He benefited

25
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:53.300
What!

26
00:00:53.933 --> 00:00:54.866
He benefited

27
00:00:54.866 --> 00:00:57.800
Brother, are you shameless to this extent?

28
00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.600
You sell fried noodles on the street

29
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.300
What can you do?

30
00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.400
Go and ask the Kowloon Group to invest trillions in Tangmen?

31
00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.766
Are you ashamed to the point where you have no bottom line?

32
00:01:06.766 --> 00:01:08.300
It's disgusting

33
00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:09.266
Alright, Li Wushuang

34
00:01:09.266 --> 00:01:10.466
I don't want to talk nonsense with you either.

35
00:01:10.466 --> 00:01:11.866
Tell me a price. What price?

36
00:01:11.866 --> 00:01:13.533
As long as you break off the engagement with me

37
00:01:13.533 --> 00:01:15.133
Tell me the number and I'll give you one.

38
00:01:15.133 --> 00:01:18.966
Why do you think I'm short of money? Haha bro

39
00:01:18.966 --> 00:01:20.800
What are you still pretending to do at this time?

40
00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.133
Are you not short of money to sell fried noodles on the street?

41
00:01:23.133 --> 00:01:25.100
I'm glad it's none of your business

42
00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:26.166
Alright Li Wushuang

43
00:01:26.166 --> 00:01:27.700
Stop acting like a hooligan

44
00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.066
Just talk about what happened between us

45
00:01:30.066 --> 00:01:31.566
How are you going to solve it?
