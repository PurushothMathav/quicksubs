00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.860
Why do you apologize? I don't accept it.

2
00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:06.400
We all make mistakes at the same time

3
00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:07.600
You talk to him alone

4
00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:10.380
I got better grades than him, and you actually sold him a place to him

5
00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.180
Now he cheated, and you talk about him as a liar?

6
00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:16.500
You are biased towards him, you don't deserve to be a teacher

7
00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:18.660
Apologize to Mr. Deng

8
00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:20.700
Don't even think about it.

9
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.060
Hit from here

10
00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:25.520
brother

11
00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.300
Bah, did you do the math?

12
00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.100
It's a rule at your school

13
00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:34.820
But you stay and suddenly dispatch the campus Yu Run

14
00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.300
It has a significant impact on campus

15
00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:39.620
County magistrate, you ordered the suspension of classes for three days

16
00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.260
Make a public apology to Xu Ziliang

17
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.620
And they report it at school.

18
00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:48.020
I don't accept it, I'm not holding back enough

19
00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:50.820
You actually made a move in front of the principal?

20
00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:53.220
Write three things well

21
00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:55.180
I deleted it.

22
00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:03.460
Stop for me

23
00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:05.020
What's wrong with you?

24
00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:06.820
You don't feel like yourself anymore

25
00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:08.760
Obviously the problem I found first

26
00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.320
Obviously I gave him a chance

27
00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.600
Why are you looking for something?

28
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.780
Did I tell you you refused to blame me?

29
00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.100
Okay.

30
00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:19.060
I was wrong.

31
00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:21.980
But are you really going to keep doing this?

32
00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.960
How do I have anything to do with you?

33
00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:25.380
How old are you?

34
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.380
Liu Qiang, don't regret it

35
00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:29.120
Who will come quickly

36
00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:30.220
Go in go in

37
00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:31.780
I'll help

38
00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.780
Send this firelight to the cold of teaching

39
00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:43.540
Hey, don't fall, don't fall

40
00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:45.180
Ah!

41
00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.820
Slow down, don't fall
