00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.900
Oh, really, I can't escape Bessipiff here

2
00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:07.440
So many times and so long

3
00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.560
That's your problem. You should have memorized it months ago.

4
00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:11.660
Can you memorize it?

5
00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:12.980
Better than you anyway

6
00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:18.160
Old Su, do you know how miserable you made me tortured by the Chinese teacher?

7
00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.820
You are a typical person. Can't you blame me?

8
00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:24.120
That's a lot of words.

9
00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:27.420
It's still difficult to memorize by rote, of course it's difficult

10
00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:28.940
But I have an idea.

11
00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:31.140
Will remember soon

12
00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:50.160
Ziliang

13
00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:51.980
You are amazing

14
00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.720
Hmph, you are pretty amazing too

15
00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:59.220
Make all these boys circle around you

16
00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:00.540
What's your secret?

17
00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:02.400
You might as well teach it

18
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:03.480
What do you mean?

19
00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.800
It's boring, isn't it obvious?

20
00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.120
There is ambiguity before and then there is Xu Ziliang

21
00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:10.900
Now the little sister is turning to you

22
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:12.720
What school flower?

23
00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.540
I think it's a courtesan, right?

24
00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:19.580
Jealousy, you want to be a courtesan, but you can't be

25
00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:21.300
What Muse?

26
00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:24.620
I think it's a tea art Muse, right?

27
00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:27.560
You didn't open your mouth yourself?

28
00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:28.900
Let someone help you everywhere

29
00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:30.340
What did you ask him to say?

30
00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.060
Does a dog bite have to bite you back?

31
00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.660
You call me a dog.

32
00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:36.700
Who opened their mouth to scold who

33
00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.980
You don't like an outing. No one invited you.

34
00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:45.800
I don't know what I did wrong to let you do this to me

35
00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.980
Since you don't welcome me, I'll just go

36
00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.340
I go to this woman

37
00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:54.660
Don't you guys like to eat meat?

38
00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.100
Brother Xi, I'm leaving first, you don't have to send me, I'm not going to send you.
