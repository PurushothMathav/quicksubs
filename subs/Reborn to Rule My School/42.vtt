00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:04.100
Look outside

2
00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:05.660
OK

3
00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:42.980
There is a situation

4
00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:45.420
If not, there is a wildcat.

5
00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.860
Stop talking nonsense. The truck will be here in half an hour

6
00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:50.420
Go take care of it

7
00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:56.900
Fortunately, there is a cat

8
00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:58.060
Danger at home

9
00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:59.760
No cat

10
00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.700
Is it very similar to what Yue Yue learned?

11
00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.380
Think I'm single and pure

12
00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:07.020
Just go.

13
00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.380
But what about the car you ride?

14
00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.500
How is losing your car better than losing your life?

15
00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:12.980
I know that woman

16
00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.020
Call Fang Yue's famous new doorman

17
00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:21.480
I never want to provoke them unless I have to, but the royal family is where I was born and raised

18
00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:23.820
How can we watch them run amok?

19
00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:25.540
Call the police.

20
00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.180
The nearest police station here is 40 kilometers away

21
00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.180
Their van arrives in half an hour

22
00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.680
There will be no evidence

23
00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.500
He went in for two days and was acquitted

24
00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.500
What should I do then?
