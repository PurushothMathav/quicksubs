00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.660
Ugly, you know?

2
00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:04.540
You almost killed the student.

3
00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:06.240
Don't you know how to reflect?

4
00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:07.740
stop stop

5
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:10.260
Kill students

6
00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:16.060
Didn't my parents work so hard to send them to me just to improve their grades?

7
00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:18.480
Jade can't be made without cutting

8
00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.220
I did it for their own good.

9
00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.640
Then you can dress up and fix it

10
00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.700
They are still children

11
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.760
Prince, Sun Chang once hurt your feelings for you, and he can't erase it for the rest of his life, do you know?

12
00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:32.120
Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes

13
00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:33.820
Everyone else is fine

14
00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.320
It's just him

15
00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:36.720
That's his problem.

16
00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:38.080
What does it have to do with me?

17
00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:38.880
you

18
00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:40.860
This poor man looks unreasonable

19
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:42.860
Don't help the Education Bureau

20
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.160
Did you mean it?

21
00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.060
Push to despair

22
00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:50.020
You're going to make it hard for me

23
00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:51.300
We will be united

24
00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.220
Threat

25
00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.500
Do you want to be detained?

26
00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.420
A jerk is a jerk

27
00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.540
I don't know at all about respecting teachers and rewarding them

28
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.220
Really uneducated

29
00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:04.580
What is it about you that deserves my respect?

30
00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:06.620
A cram school like you

31
00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.220
There is one I tell the other what do you say?

32
00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:10.820
Do you know

33
00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.140
How many top students have I trained from my cram school?

34
00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.020
Trash like you

35
00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.060
Never understand

36
00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:20.940
I don't want to understand

37
00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:22.980
I'm too lazy to understand

38
00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:25.660
Violent teaching is itself illegal

39
00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:27.780
He should have known better.

40
00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.380
fart

41
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.060
Teachers can't call students teachers

42
00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.620
You say we should wake up

43
00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:43.140
Okay, do you dare to represent Huanggao and compete with us?

44
00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:47.140
Let us experience the high level of your emperor

45
00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:49.620
With old products

46
00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:51.980
Three more doors

47
00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:53.860
same test paper

48
00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:55.080
Answer on the spot

49
00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:56.300
I won.

50
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.800
You Huang Gao asked me for free, the cram school is open, the book is round, you lose, and you close your door.

51
00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:05.940
Never hold cram schools again

52
00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.420
It's a deal, it's a deal.

53
00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:09.980
fetch water

54
00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:11.900
Make a decision next time
