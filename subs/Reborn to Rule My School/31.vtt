00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:03.660
You ask Ge Yu what's going on

2
00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:05.460
I like him.

3
00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:07.820
Your liking will harm him

4
00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:09.100
Tell me about it.

5
00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:10.540
What would I do to him?

6
00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:11.740
I just say one word

7
00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:13.240
Can you give him a better future?

8
00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:14.780
Can you take him abroad?

9
00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:17.020
When is the best future going abroad?

10
00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:20.380
How many years has our country been

11
00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:22.180
Why is this still the case?

12
00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:24.300
That's not what I meant. What do you mean?

13
00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:26.780
You feel good, it's just that you think

14
00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.120
It's your business what you want to export

15
00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:28.920
Did you ask him?

16
00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.200
Would he like to

17
00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:31.520
Why wouldn't he?

18
00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.940
To become a good mathematician was his only option

19
00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:39.100
Isn't it?

20
00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.160
Their familiarity with the one stated by Toprijson doesn't leave us a few streets away

21
00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.420
We study abroad to see what's wrong with them

22
00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:48.620
That's true. At the moment, we really can't compare

23
00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:50.700
But all these years

24
00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:53.600
How much fascinating research has come out of our country?

25
00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.540
To the extent that the whole world was shocked

26
00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:57.940
Haven't you seen it?

27
00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:59.480
The pace of development is fast

28
00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.020
But he but what but

29
00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:04.620
But you don't believe him at all.

30
00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.380
What I saw was an enterprising man

31
00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.540
Is a man who is about to stand on top of the world

32
00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:11.080
You don't pitch concepts.

33
00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.660
What we are discussing now is the issue of going abroad, not the problem

34
00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.140
Tonight Xu Ziliang was right

35
00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.060
I just want to win the math Olympiad and bring glory to the country now

36
00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:27.740
Even after I went abroad, I would come back to work.

37
00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.200
It's good that you can go abroad

38
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.700
But I don't envy you.

39
00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:34.040
empty talk

40
00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.220
For me, grasping the moment is the best choice

41
00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:39.100
Come on.

42
00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:45.900
How did you come here?

43
00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:52.740
Sister Chun, what about the gift you chose for Yueyue last time? Yueyue likes it very much.

44
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.220
This time it's his birthday, I think

45
00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.140
Can you do me one more favor?

46
00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.700
You still don't know what Yueyue likes?

47
00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.200
The latest Mathematical Olympiad data?

48
00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.260
Are you sure?

49
00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:05.660
This gift has to be what you like

50
00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.820
Sister Chen, wait for me.
