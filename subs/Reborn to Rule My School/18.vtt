00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:01.380
Foul?

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.860
Referee they fouled

3
00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:06.940
It doesn't count. This doesn't count.

4
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.680
Why is the upper brain arguing like this?

5
00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:12.780
Relatively, I think it's better to forget it.

6
00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:14.780
If you want to go, you go.

7
00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.060
Then I'll withdraw first.

8
00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:25.940
What do you want?

9
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.900
It turns out that you can only talk like this

10
00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:31.880
What did you say, you did it all

11
00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:32.820
Afraid of people saying

12
00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:35.220
OK, we foul.

13
00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.340
What about your people running halfway through?

14
00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.100
If there is no substitute, will such a person sleep?

15
00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:44.580
The special training class will never surrender

16
00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:46.040
Huh?

17
00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:49.380
Great, but can you fight?

18
00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:50.980
You'll know after a fight

19
00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:53.960
Hey
