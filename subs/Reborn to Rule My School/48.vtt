00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:24.260
Good time

2
00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.420
Susan, come here

3
00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.860
Can you tell me what you think about this question?

4
00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:44.760
What about this question?

5
00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.020
Looks like a lot of problems

6
00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.300
In fact, he has very few useful hearts

7
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.480
You see, if you put this triangle inside this cube

8
00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:54.660
Remember to reduce the space

9
00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:55.740
Isn't that easier?

10
00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.060
Yeah, got an answer.

11
00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.820
Chen Gui, you are really not as good as this.

12
00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:03.060
That's impossible.

13
00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.220
He's a scumbag.

14
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.160
How could he ask such a difficult question?

15
00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.960
Chen Gui

16
00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:10.100
You're out

17
00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.060
Is this your own opinion on the inevitability of quality-oriented education?

18
00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:22.880
Yes, quality-oriented education has always been a slogan

19
00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:23.740
I'm so glad.

20
00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:27.140
In our Huang Gao, he is not that we want to support all the way

21
00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.820
All the way

22
00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:30.900
Just like our school department

23
00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:32.300
Hongde school

24
00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:33.700
Go Ahead

25
00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.100
It's really scary.

26
00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:39.060
I am proud to have a student like you in Huanggang

27
00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:42.500
He's growing up fast.

28
00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.260
He will definitely surpass us in the near future

29
00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.300
He has surpassed us

30
00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:51.020
Mr. Han, who will win this competition?

31
00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.580
Tell me about it.

32
00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:00.900
I declare that the winner of this competition is Xu Zhiliang

33
00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:13.360
I won't lose

34
00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.340
I don't agree.

35
00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.780
We received a report from the public that you are suspected of violence

36
00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.580
Come for a walk. Come on

37
00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.980
This is the Olympic ticket saying yes

38
00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:30.820
Touch the admission ticket for the first time in two lives

39
00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:32.720
Quite excited

40
00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.380
What?

41
00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.980
I said excited

42
00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:38.400
Then you say yes

43
00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.340
Don't lose it. Hmm.

44
00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:45.940
Space reminded

45
00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.880
Can you start a new life?

46
00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.420
That's it.
