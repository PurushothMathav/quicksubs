00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:03.820
Did you hear?

2
00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.080
Straight-A student visiting the clinic late at night

3
00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:06.880
Yeah.

4
00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:08.380
That's who he is

5
00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:12.180
I didn't expect Ge Yue to meet such a random person

6
00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:13.860
Are you playing with flowers?

7
00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.780
No way enough

8
00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:17.860
No money to spend

9
00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:19.620
If you have the ability, say it face to face

10
00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:25.340
Please please

11
00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:29.160
What happened yesterday

12
00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.220
This question has blocked you all, haven't you heard?

13
00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.080
The mouth belongs to someone else

14
00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:34.360
Your ears are your own

15
00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:35.400
Just don't listen

16
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:36.680
Don't take me with you on this

17
00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:38.520
Look what it's all about

18
00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.040
Who did you offend?

19
00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.240
We've been working together lately on a new project.

20
00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:43.860
I don't have time to go out and offend people

21
00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:46.120
Maybe we could hire teachers.

22
00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:49.740
Mediocrity doesn't have to hit you, little monster really doesn't have to take it

23
00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:53.980
Count well

24
00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:55.480
The monthly exam is coming soon.

25
00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:57.820
Yeah, when you take another change test

26
00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.180
They can close their mouths

27
00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:03.160
So we don't have to be confused by these little distractions in front of us

28
00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:04.300
Review well

29
00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.020
Let's all three come on, come on

30
00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:10.860
Come on.
