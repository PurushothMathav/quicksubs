00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:01.820
He lied.

2
00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:06.580
I went to see him last Wednesday.

3
00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:08.020
I saw him with my own eyes

4
00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:09.820
Test papers happen in the office

5
00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:11.340
hadron

6
00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:14.100
What do you mean?

7
00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:19.140
The day after I saw him enter the office

8
00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.460
He took out the test center 07.

9
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:23.780
Changde, what are you talking about?

10
00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:25.860
Liang Zihan just entered the office

11
00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:28.020
Do you think you are so skeptical?

12
00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.540
Director, I did go to the office last Wednesday

13
00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:34.180
But I went to get a list for Ge Yue

14
00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:35.620
Because I don't know where

15
00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:37.420
So I watch it every week.

16
00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.980
But I really didn't see any monthly test papers.

17
00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:41.900
Look old next year

18
00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:43.740
At your level

19
00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:46.480
I can't analyze the question at all

20
00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:48.960
Liang Zi, please admit your mistake

21
00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.540
The teachers won't make it difficult for you

22
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.060
fart

23
00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.500
Is this recognizable?

24
00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:56.000
Liu Xiang, what do you mean?

25
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.360
What kind of person is Liang Zi?

26
00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.940
Don't you know our brothers in recent years?

27
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:07.740
Go quickly

28
00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:16.560
Xu Ziliang

29
00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:20.140
This is really not going to work out.

30
00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:22.940
I just discussed it with Mr. Zhao.

31
00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:26.160
We've decided not to deal with this matter for you.

32
00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.340
But your test results this time

33
00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:30.820
To void

34
00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:32.420
Yeah, I agree.

35
00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.900
Just follow Principal Lin's method

36
00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:36.660
Cannot be voided
