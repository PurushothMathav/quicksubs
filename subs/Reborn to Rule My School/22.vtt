00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.860
Xu Ziliang, someone reported that you cheated on the monthly exam.

2
00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:04.540
Is there anything you want to say?

3
00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:05.700
I didn't cheat.

4
00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:08.860
Teacher Deng, don't you believe me?

5
00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:12.460
This matter has already come to a head in Heaven

6
00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.340
It's having a huge impact on fertility in schools.

7
00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:18.260
The school wants to give the students an explanation

8
00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:20.100
If you can't tell

9
00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:22.260
We will ask your parents to come and explain the situation.

10
00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.460
Don't bring the special training class

11
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.620
Why do we need a fair and fairness playing field?

12
00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:34.700
Teacher, I want to go back and get a review material. Okay.

13
00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:51.640
Xu Deliang's information covers 60% of the exam.

14
00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.080
He also said that it is not a stolen question. If it is a stolen question

15
00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:55.820
His next time not reaching full marks is the answer

16
00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:00.060
This was calculated by probability a week before the exam, and I also shared it with two of my classmates

17
00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:01.220
They can form

18
00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:06.820
Then you can call your friend over. 86-year-old examinee, how can you be so embarrassed?

19
00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:08.580
Ok, you said it.

20
00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:11.720
Hey, Lao Lin

21
00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:12.680
Don't tell me

22
00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:17.300
You can be at ease nowhere. The feedback of this far light is very good.

23
00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.260
This is recommended by my daughter.

24
00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.700
My daughter said that I work at a desk for a long time

25
00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:23.460
Bad for the eyes

26
00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.080
This eye protection lamp can make my eyes less tired.

27
00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.080
So I thought of you.

28
00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:30.700
Hahaha yes

29
00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.200
Old Han from the Education Bureau

30
00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.840
Do the basic renovation of teaching here?

31
00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.500
He likes our moon shadow lamp very much after the inspection

32
00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.260
How about we prepare a set for him to experience?

33
00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.140
And that's a good thing.

34
00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.120
If this member can be vigorously promoted among students

35
00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:51.340
That's great for protecting students' eyesight. Yeah.

36
00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.200
So, um, I'll make a call later and you'll go get a knife

37
00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.460
Ok, no problem.

38
00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.980
Yo, hey, village chief, you're here

39
00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.340
Teacher Liang Zi, he can't cheat

40
00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:07.740
Hadron, tell them

41
00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.840
teacher

42
00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:11.320
Xu Ziliang did give us a high temper

43
00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:12.880
Said he analyzed it

44
00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:14.740
But I think

45
00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:16.420
He lied.
