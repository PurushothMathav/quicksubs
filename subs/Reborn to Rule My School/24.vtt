00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:00.920
Cannot be voided

2
00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:03.240
Teacher, if the grade is invalid

3
00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:04.820
Xu Mo thinks who cheated and how

4
00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:05.960
It's not fair to him.

5
00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:07.380
But what if he cheats?

6
00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:09.500
It's even more unfair to other students

7
00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:14.020
Then you have to see what the mentality of the person who posted the post is, right? Liu Qiang

8
00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:16.920
How do I know?

9
00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.980
It's not Lao Tie, it's you, right?

10
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.560
Internet Protocol Address is Your Home

11
00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:22.700
Don't be unable to find it.

12
00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:24.420
So what if it's me?

13
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:25.700
He broke the rules

14
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:26.880
I have an obligation to report

15
00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.400
Then why don't you dissuade in time or report to the teacher privately?

16
00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.580
But to use public opinion to nurture the school

17
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.680
I don't want to lose this good brother, okay?

18
00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:36.720
Not yet.

19
00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:41.140
You're just jealous that he's outdone you by leaps and bounds, right?

20
00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.420
I don't have him misbehaving

21
00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.140
Why are you targeting me?

22
00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.760
Did you forget what he did before?

23
00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:52.540
What are you talking about? What are you doing?

24
00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.420
Okay, okay, let me say a few words

25
00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:59.240
Teacher Zhao, what did you say about the opening of our monthly exam?

26
00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:00.600
Something went wrong with the opening

27
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:01.620
Three questions.

28
00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.940
It opened last Thursday.

29
00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.460
Yes, I went to the office last Wednesday

30
00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.380
We hadn't come out yet when we opened

31
00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.260
Where did he ask me from?

32
00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:18.040
Liu Qiang

33
00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:19.240
Liu Qiang

34
00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.520
You have not publicly slandered your classmates

35
00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.540
Now I order you to clarify the facts

36
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.420
Publicly apologize to Xu Ziliang

37
00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.940
And make a full report and apologize one by one

38
00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:32.660
Why?
