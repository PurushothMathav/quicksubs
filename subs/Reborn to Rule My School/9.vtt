00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.820
Hey.

2
00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:03.560
Is the selection exam just like that?

3
00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:04.920
Especially question 17.

4
00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:06.180
Not rigorous at all

5
00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:06.600
Really?

6
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:06.800
OK

7
00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:08.400
Actually, I don't think it's right either.

8
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:08.600
OK

9
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:09.020
or

10
00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:10.780
Check with the teacher.

11
00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:12.360
Hey, go ahead, I'm tired.

12
00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:13.540
I'll go back for a while

13
00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:15.940
Uh-huh.

14
00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:28.820
24 Hey, there are still seven or eight people at the bottom for me

15
00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:33.120
78 Hey, I already knew I couldn't get on it.

16
00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.060
Lady, don't be too sad

17
00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:36.820
I seem to be in

18
00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.220
Yoshiko, you can do it!

19
00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:46.500
Yoshiko, my score is higher than yours

20
00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.020
How did you get in?

21
00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:49.500
I don't know.

22
00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.360
The list of this special training class is correct, right?

23
00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:04.420
If there is a problem, Liu Qiang's grades have always been above mine.

24
00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.820
I got into him instead

25
00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.100
Do you remember?

26
00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.740
I remember the last time I came over and asked him.

27
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.820
Episode 17 is a trap we designed

28
00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:21.900
There are only four discoveries in the whole school

29
00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:23.780
Priority will be given to admission.

30
00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:26.340
In fact, Liu Xiang also discovered

31
00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.100
But he didn't come.

32
00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:31.920
Xu Ziliang, did you know?

33
00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.600
Math is now more than problem-finding thinking.

34
00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.060
And the spirit of inquiry

35
00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:38.540
Xu Ziliang

36
00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.380
You picked up a cheap one.
