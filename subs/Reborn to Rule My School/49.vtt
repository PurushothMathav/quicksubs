00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:01.280
return

2
00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:02.460
Money refund money refund

3
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.780
The money must be refunded.

4
00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:06.500
Not a penny less?

5
00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:09.620
Look what you've done to my child

6
00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:12.480
My kids don't want to talk anymore

7
00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.720
If my child has three long and two short, I can't finish with you

8
00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:16.660
I say you

9
00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:20.780
If you can pay, I will make up lessons for you.

10
00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.660
Why should I refund the money for two issues of money and goods?

11
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.580
I'll tell you what.

12
00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:28.520
My training class is about to be shut down

13
00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:30.800
If you push me again

14
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.020
I will fight you

15
00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:33.640
Laugh less

16
00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.340
I'm telling you, we're not done yet.

17
00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.660
Ahhh

18
00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:40.080
Don't be impulsive

19
00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.180
Why are you against me?

20
00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:44.100
If it weren't for you

21
00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:45.680
Everything is fine.

22
00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:46.780
You deserve the most

23
00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:48.620
Damn it! Damn it!

24
00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:50.500
So you let him go?

25
00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:51.860
Change me

26
00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.940
Can you replace him?

27
00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:57.860
You just come over.

28
00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.500
I'll let him go right away

29
00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:01.700
You let him go, Mr. Liang

30
00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:05.260
It's not your fault.

31
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:06.980
I see.

32
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.960
But I can't ignore it.

33
00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:10.980
But you have an exam tomorrow.

34
00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:13.020
Hahahaha

35
00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:16.780
Forget it, I think you're a coward

36
00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.820
Saving him is more important than the Mathematical Olympiad

37
00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:26.900
Let him go and I will fulfill you

38
00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.300
I used to go to hell
