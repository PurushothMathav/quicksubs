Hey, how do you think this moon shadow eye protection lamp is so bright and soft and comfortable at the same time?

2
00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:09.620
I heard what sky model technology Moon Shadow used

3
00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:12.100
It is to restore the natural light of youth

4
00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:14.420
Highlight yellow bird invincible flash

5
00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:15.700
98 high color rendering

6
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:16.740
uniform light

7
00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.580
The most important thing is that there is no blue light hazard

8
00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.560
Many people don't know that the blue light emitted by lamps can easily lead to myopia

9
00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:28.020
It's true that many people don't realize that lights are also very blue.

10
00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:30.060
I really want to let go at home

11
00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:31.660
Then buy one

12
00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:34.860
Isn't it just a lamp?

13
00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.440
As for? Why not?

14
00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.400
Myopia is a lifetime thing

15
00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.420
I don't want to tell you with glasses on

16
00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.620
This off-road natural light eye protection lamp is really amazing

17
00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.940
Well, I'm afraid it's not an IQ tax, right?

18
00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:49.300
Of course I don't believe you, ask Ziliang

19
00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:50.580
Let's put it this way.

20
00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:51.920
Looking at the light

21
00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.640
Is it suitable for the sun as natural?

22
00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:55.980
Hmm stare

23
00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:57.380
No pressure at all.

24
00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:59.580
That doesn't mean the room is myopic.

25
00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.080
Are you brainwashed?

26
00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:03.380
How is that possible?

27
00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:05.240
Look at so many people in our special training class

28
00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:06.240
Studying is so stressful

29
00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.220
How many are myopic?

30
00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:08.540
This is the proof.

31
00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.140
It's a pity that there is no one in the Mathematical Olympiad Power Camp

32
00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:19.220
Don't worry, my dad is sponsoring the Math Olympiad Power Camp to improve these lights for my eyesight health.

33
00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.620
Let the moon shadow natural light eye protection lamp accompany us to impact the Mathematical Olympiad together

34
00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.100
That's fine.
