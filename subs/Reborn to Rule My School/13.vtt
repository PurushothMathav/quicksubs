00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:06.620
Qi Yi, did you spread the rumor?

2
00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:08.180
I'm doing this for you

3
00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.866
for me

4
00:00:08.866 --> 00:00:12.280
Girls like guys who are better than themselves

5
00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:15.240
If something goes wrong with Ge Yue, you won't be above her

6
00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:16.460
I don't need your help.

7
00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:18.260
Take care of yourself for me

8
00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:23.500
Ge Yue is not finished with you

9
00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.140
You had something to do last night

10
00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:27.940
Sorry for being late

11
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.200
Well, forget it when the time has passed.

12
00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.460
What are you going to do now?

13
00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:37.900
What are you doing? Don't you want to go further with Ge Yue?

14
00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:42.920
I want to, but what is it? But if you are Ge Yue, it will belong to someone else.

15
00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.840
Look at that duckling matching Ge Yue every day is very easy, in case they are sincere?

16
00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:48.260
Where are you going to cry?

17
00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:49.400
I agree with this.

18
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:50.700
Then what shall I do?

19
00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:54.740
Romance requires candles

20
00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.060
Girls with flowers like this

21
00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:59.380
I think so.

22
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.860
You have to have the momentum to show him your determination

23
00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.940
So you can prepare these two boxes.

24
00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:11.500
I'm going to take it

25
00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:14.240
Ah

26
00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.220
Stand for me

27
00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.560
The boss let me know he was nosy

28
00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.600
Otherwise, we'll wave together. I've been beating you for days, and I finally caught you today.

29
00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.860
What are you talking about? I don't know!

30
00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.720
You are dragging me to call someone, are you shouting?

31
00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.540
See if you call people fast or I'm all fast

32
00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:43.460
Your people, help me

33
00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.420
Mom, are you really shouting?

34
00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.940
Who kicked me, I, Liu Wang, are you fine?

35
00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.420
Stop me while I'm hurt, right?

36
00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:59.160
Let's go
