00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.500
Sister Jian Dao, 

2
00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:02.066
I'm at the office door

3
00:00:02.466 --> 00:00:03.966
But I don’t have the password

4
00:00:04.366 --> 00:00:06.533
Try 880604

5
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:08.166
It’s Zhang Wen Xu’s birthday

6
00:00:19.133 --> 00:00:19.933
Wait a minute

7
00:00:19.933 --> 00:00:21.400
Do you see a green plant in his office?

8
00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:22.366
Yes 

9
00:00:22.533 --> 00:00:22.833
Why?

10
00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:24.066
What’s wrong?

11
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.333
There’s a small camera behind the plant

12
00:00:26.766 --> 00:00:27.900
Cover it up

13
00:00:46.266 --> 00:00:47.500
Zhang Wen Xu’s computer has a password, 

14
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:48.766
I don’t know it either

15
00:00:49.533 --> 00:00:50.466
How about 

16
00:00:50.733 --> 00:00:51.800
you try his birthday again

17
00:00:59.866 --> 00:01:01.600
I tried, but his birthday

18
00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:02.333
isn’t it

19
00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:03.900
Is there any other 

20
00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:05.733
important date for him?

21
00:01:09.766 --> 00:01:10.600
How about your child’s birthday? 

22
00:01:10.866 --> 00:01:11.966
Our daughter's birthday

23
00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:13.966
is 020819

24
00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:20.100
Still not it

25
00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.100
Is there another date?

26
00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:23.933
Let me think again

27
00:01:31.033 --> 00:01:32.166
Didn’t you say

28
00:01:32.166 --> 00:01:33.933
that for Wen Xu, the most important thing to him 

29
00:01:33.933 --> 00:01:35.500
is himself and his own interests?

30
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.133
Does that matter?

31
00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:40.933
Try 990324 

32
00:01:41.633 --> 00:01:43.133
That’s the day after he took over the company

33
00:01:43.133 --> 00:01:44.666
the day the company went public
