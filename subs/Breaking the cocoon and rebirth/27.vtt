00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:01.333
Jian Dao, what do you want to do?

2
00:00:01.333 --> 00:00:01.900
Don't forget, 

3
00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:03.700
Jian An Real Estate is under my control now

4
00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:06.400
Jian An Real Estate is still mine after all

5
00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.300
You are just a temporary manager

6
00:00:08.666 --> 00:00:09.566
Divorce is possible

7
00:00:09.933 --> 00:00:12.100
But don't even think about Jian An's shares

8
00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:14.200
Do you mean 

9
00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.066
I should hand over the shares to you?

10
00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:19.966
I not only own shares in Jian An Construction Real Estate

11
00:00:19.966 --> 00:00:21.600
The board of directors is also under my control

12
00:00:21.933 --> 00:00:23.866
Don't even think about returning to Jian An Real Estate

13
00:00:24.433 --> 00:00:25.200
Zhang Wen Xu, 

14
00:00:26.033 --> 00:00:27.000
I once thought you 

15
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.133
were a man

16
00:00:28.366 --> 00:00:30.333
But when I caught you cheating in public

17
00:00:30.333 --> 00:00:32.433
all you did was threaten me with shares

18
00:00:33.233 --> 00:00:33.766
Jiang Yu Yong

19
00:00:34.533 --> 00:00:36.133
I treated you so well before

20
00:00:36.133 --> 00:00:37.766
I saw you as my sister

21
00:00:38.266 --> 00:00:39.933
But how did you treat me?

22
00:00:39.933 --> 00:00:41.400
You fought with me over a man

23
00:00:42.666 --> 00:00:44.200
And fought over a man

24
00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.166
who dares to do but not admit it

25
00:00:46.933 --> 00:00:47.800
Everyone

26
00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.566
you all saw it

27
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.100
One is my husband

28
00:00:52.266 --> 00:00:54.466
The other is my husband's secretary

29
00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.166
They blatantly 

30
00:00:58.333 --> 00:00:59.666
cheated on me together

31
00:01:04.666 --> 00:01:05.766
No, no

32
00:01:05.766 --> 00:01:06.966
It's not like that

33
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.066
It's not 

34
00:01:08.866 --> 00:01:10.366
How is it not like that?

35
00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.533
What else is there to explain?

36
00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:17.133
Zhang Wen Xu 

37
00:01:17.566 --> 00:01:18.400
You didnâ€™t expect this, did you?

38
00:01:19.466 --> 00:01:21.400
Your current pain

39
00:01:22.466 --> 00:01:23.333
is happiness for you, 

40
00:01:23.566 --> 00:01:25.366
happiness indeed

41
00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.500
Why has she changed so much?
