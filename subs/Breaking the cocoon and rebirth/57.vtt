00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:01.766
As long as you say a word to Mr. Zhang

2
00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:03.766
This won't be difficult

3
00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:07.300
Wen Xu sent me to stir things up

4
00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.066
But he can't know 

5
00:00:09.066 --> 00:00:10.400
I'm pretending to be Jian Dao

6
00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:12.633
Such a small matter and you need to bother Mr. Zhang?

7
00:00:13.366 --> 00:00:14.400
Can't you handle it?

8
00:00:17.533 --> 00:00:19.066
Please

9
00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:34.933
Send me today's bidding information

10
00:00:36.133 --> 00:00:37.966
That's not my responsibility

11
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.200
Not your responsibility? 

12
00:00:42.733 --> 00:00:43.566
Alright

13
00:00:45.566 --> 00:00:46.166
Jian Dao, 

14
00:00:46.366 --> 00:00:47.866
don't think just because you're a collaborator

15
00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:49.400
you can stroll around Li Shi

16
00:00:49.733 --> 00:00:50.633
Let me tell you

17
00:00:50.833 --> 00:00:51.766
On your first day of work 

18
00:00:51.766 --> 00:00:53.400
you refused a task assigned by your boss

19
00:00:54.033 --> 00:00:55.366
With this work attitude

20
00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:56.733
No matter who your backer is 

21
00:00:56.733 --> 00:00:57.700
I will fire you

22
00:00:59.933 --> 00:01:00.866
I've heard 

23
00:01:00.866 --> 00:01:02.666
that this newcomer got the job through connections

24
00:01:02.833 --> 00:01:04.100
Turns out it's true

25
00:01:09.566 --> 00:01:10.533
Fire me?

26
00:01:12.266 --> 00:01:12.733
Yes, 

27
00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.400
if you can get this done today, do it

28
00:01:15.733 --> 00:01:16.900
If you can't do it

29
00:01:17.266 --> 00:01:18.400
Get out of here
