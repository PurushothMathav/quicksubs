00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.500
Jian Dao,

2
00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.100
Watch your mouth.

3
00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:05.433
Eat your meal.

4
00:00:06.466 --> 00:00:06.933
Auntie,

5
00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:08.033
try this dish.

6
00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:10.633
Yu Yong,

7
00:00:11.266 --> 00:00:12.166
If Wen Xu had married you,

8
00:00:12.166 --> 00:00:14.133
things would have been so much better.

9
00:00:15.366 --> 00:00:17.533
If he had married you,

10
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.100
my grandson

11
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:20.966
would already have several siblings.

12
00:00:21.266 --> 00:00:22.933
Not like some people's wombs

13
00:00:23.366 --> 00:00:24.333
who don't even try.

14
00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:27.133
What? 

15
00:00:27.133 --> 00:00:28.166
Can't I say that?

16
00:00:28.166 --> 00:00:28.900
Not much luck,

17
00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:29.600
but a big temper.

18
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:32.833
Zhi Han,

19
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.733
come home with Mom.

20
00:00:35.066 --> 00:00:35.500
Alright.

21
00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.200
Is it so hard to eat quietly?

22
00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:42.166
Oh, right,

23
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:43.900
I still have soup simmering in the kitchen.

24
00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:44.533
I'll go check on it.

25
00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:49.366
Don't say such things anymore.

26
00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:50.733
I'm not wrong.

27
00:00:52.966 --> 00:00:53.433
Zhi Han.

28
00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:56.233
Stop it.

29
00:00:56.633 --> 00:00:57.700
Do it for Zhi Han's sake.

30
00:01:06.433 --> 00:01:07.033
Zhi Han,

31
00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.100
shall Dad peel a shrimp for you?

32
00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.800
Yes.
