00:00:02.333 --> 00:00:03.800
President Li, you were looking for me?

2
00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:07.566
Zhang Wen Xu

3
00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:09.900
You’ve been getting close to my sister lately, haven’t you?

4
00:00:10.166 --> 00:00:10.966
Yes

5
00:00:11.366 --> 00:00:13.166
Jian Dao and I have no feelings for each other anymore

6
00:00:13.166 --> 00:00:14.633
Your sister is single

7
00:00:14.633 --> 00:00:16.266
So we’ve gotten closer

8
00:00:16.266 --> 00:00:17.600
Is there a problem?

9
00:00:20.866 --> 00:00:22.833
Zhang Wen Xu, you know

10
00:00:23.466 --> 00:00:24.400
I’ve never liked you

11
00:00:25.566 --> 00:00:26.800
If I get the chance

12
00:00:27.233 --> 00:00:28.133
I’ll definitely make sure 

13
00:00:28.133 --> 00:00:29.766
you walk down a miserable path

14
00:00:30.433 --> 00:00:32.000
I hope you don’t give me that chance

15
00:00:36.333 --> 00:00:37.133
President Li

16
00:00:37.366 --> 00:00:38.833
Don’t you have a thing 

17
00:00:38.833 --> 00:00:40.633
for that trashy woman I got tired of?

18
00:00:40.633 --> 00:00:41.366
Why didn’t you say so earlier?

19
00:00:41.366 --> 00:00:42.366
If you had just said something, she’s just a woman, 

20
00:00:42.366 --> 00:00:43.500
I’d give her to you

21
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.233
Why make it come to this?

22
00:00:45.233 --> 00:00:45.966
Shut up

23
00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:47.600
Oh dear

24
00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:49.166
President Li 

25
00:00:49.166 --> 00:00:51.200
if you called me here today 

26
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.000
to interfere with my love life

27
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.766
Then I guess we have nothing to talk about

28
00:00:57.766 --> 00:00:58.500
How much?

29
00:01:03.333 --> 00:01:04.900
This isn’t about money

30
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.333
For someone like you, is there really anything 

31
00:01:08.333 --> 00:01:09.566
money can’t solve?

32
00:01:11.633 --> 00:01:12.800
Your sister holds 

33
00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:15.100
35% of Li Shi Group shares

34
00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:16.000
Tell me 

35
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.400
how much are those 35% shares worth?

36
00:01:23.766 --> 00:01:24.600
So...

37
00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.766
So you’re with her for the shares?

38
00:01:27.833 --> 00:01:29.466
It’s not that I want the shares

39
00:01:29.466 --> 00:01:31.200
Your sister insists on giving them to me

40
00:01:32.766 --> 00:01:33.933
Who told her to be so naive?

41
00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:35.000
She’s just like...

42
00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:38.233
Jian Dao back in the day
