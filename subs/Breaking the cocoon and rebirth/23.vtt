00:00:00.833 --> 00:00:01.533
Husband

2
00:00:07.433 --> 00:00:08.833
What a coincidence

3
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.233
Why are you here?

4
00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:13.500
Didn't you say last time

5
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:14.566
the dress didn't fit?

6
00:00:14.566 --> 00:00:15.533
I came here

7
00:00:15.533 --> 00:00:16.500
to order a new one for you

8
00:00:19.066 --> 00:00:20.000
But

9
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.500
how did you come out of the fitting room?

10
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:23.766
I happened to want to come here

11
00:00:23.766 --> 00:00:25.233
so I ordered a few clothes

12
00:00:25.466 --> 00:00:27.633
Took a few in to try on

13
00:00:27.633 --> 00:00:29.733
So, did any fit?

14
00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:31.366
None of them fit

15
00:00:31.733 --> 00:00:33.333
Maybe it's because KILA

16
00:00:33.333 --> 00:00:34.666
only designs women's clothing

17
00:00:34.866 --> 00:00:35.766
It's not your fault

18
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.100
Husband

19
00:00:40.666 --> 00:00:41.866
Are you hot?

20
00:00:41.866 --> 00:00:43.566
Why are you sweating so much?

21
00:00:43.566 --> 00:00:44.366
I'm not hot

22
00:00:45.066 --> 00:00:47.133
Maybe the air conditioner is broken

23
00:01:00.533 --> 00:01:01.433
Why are you...

24
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.500
Let me adjust the air conditioner

25
00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:04.866
Even someone who fears the cold like you

26
00:01:04.866 --> 00:01:05.600
feels hot

27
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:06.733
So how hot must the people

28
00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:07.966
coming in after you feel?

29
00:01:08.266 --> 00:01:09.166
Let me adjust it a bit

30
00:01:09.166 --> 00:01:10.866
It will be a good deed

31
00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:17.733
Aren't you leaving?

32
00:01:19.333 --> 00:01:20.966
I'm going with Li Bei QÄ«ng

33
00:01:20.966 --> 00:01:23.266
to choose a gift for his sister
