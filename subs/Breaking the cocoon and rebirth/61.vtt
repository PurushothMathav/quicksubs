00:00:00.466 --> 00:00:01.566
What are you freaking out about?

2
00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:03.900
I told you, Wen Xu gave this to me

3
00:00:04.133 --> 00:00:05.400
Do you have proof it's yours?

4
00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:06.766
This bracelet 

5
00:00:07.133 --> 00:00:08.500
is called Tian Huan

6
00:00:08.933 --> 00:00:10.866
At the charity dinner in Jiang City

7
00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:12.966
it was sold for 100 million (*)
(*) ~ 350 billion VND

8
00:00:13.633 --> 00:00:14.633
100 million 

9
00:00:14.866 --> 00:00:16.066
Is it real or fake?

10
00:00:20.333 --> 00:00:21.800
It's truly Tian Huan 

11
00:00:21.933 --> 00:00:23.400
worth 100 million

12
00:00:27.866 --> 00:00:28.666
How could that be?

13
00:00:28.833 --> 00:00:30.866
Didn't Wen Xu say it was only worth 3 million?

14
00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:32.466
If that's the case, 

15
00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.766
then that bracelet must be hers

16
00:00:35.866 --> 00:00:36.800
I heard before

17
00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.033
Isn't she Mr. Zhang's secretary at Jian An Real Estate?

18
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:40.000
Did you forget?

19
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:40.700
Jian Dao said before 

20
00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.266
she's the real Mrs. Zhang

21
00:00:44.533 --> 00:00:45.600
One hundred million

22
00:00:46.166 --> 00:00:47.200
I shouldn't have put it 

23
00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:48.566
in Jian An's bag

24
00:00:49.066 --> 00:00:49.666
See 

25
00:00:49.666 --> 00:00:51.966
she doesn't even know the true value of the bracelet

26
00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.133
The legendary Mrs. Zhang is truly kind-hearted

27
00:00:56.166 --> 00:00:57.400
And she's a real beauty too

28
00:00:57.766 --> 00:00:59.800
But she's so different from the Mrs. Zhang in the legend

29
00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:00.933
Such a huge difference

30
00:01:00.966 --> 00:01:02.266
Tell me 

31
00:01:02.266 --> 00:01:04.233
why is she targeting Jian Dao?

32
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.333
What are you gossiping about?

33
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.366
What does the price say?

34
00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:09.133
This

35
00:01:10.566 --> 00:01:12.733
My husband must have thought the bracelet was too expensive

36
00:01:12.733 --> 00:01:13.900
and would burden me

37
00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:15.400
So he told me it was only worth 3 million

38
00:01:17.866 --> 00:01:18.966
What if I said 

39
00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.200
my name is engraved on it?
