00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:01.600
Mrs. Zhang, 

2
00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:03.700
they don't know me

3
00:00:04.166 --> 00:00:06.600
These people think they're talking to Mrs. Zhang

4
00:00:06.733 --> 00:00:07.266
Oh

5
00:00:07.566 --> 00:00:08.433
I'm fine

6
00:00:10.266 --> 00:00:11.833
She's fine

7
00:00:12.066 --> 00:00:13.566
But Mrs. Zhang isn't fine

8
00:00:14.766 --> 00:00:16.166
What are you talking about?

9
00:00:16.466 --> 00:00:17.900
Mrs. Zhang is clearly standing by me

10
00:00:22.033 --> 00:00:23.766
You mean... you're the real Mrs. Zhang?

11
00:00:24.733 --> 00:00:26.600
I mean, before you start flattering

12
00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:27.700
didn't you check 

13
00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:29.000
my information and photo?

14
00:00:29.766 --> 00:00:30.433
What? 

15
00:00:30.666 --> 00:00:32.200
She's the real Mrs. Zhang?

16
00:00:32.466 --> 00:00:33.533
Is it real or fake?

17
00:00:33.533 --> 00:00:34.733
I think she's the real one

18
00:00:35.733 --> 00:00:38.400
So they don't know Jian Dao

19
00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:40.300
Then it's easier

20
00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:42.433
What kind of Mrs. Zhang is she?

21
00:00:42.966 --> 00:00:45.366
She's just our secretary at Jian An Real Estate

22
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:47.300
If you don't believe me

23
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.366
I'll call Zhang Wen Xu right now

24
00:00:52.066 --> 00:00:54.333
On her phone, it seems like it's Mr. Zhang

25
00:00:54.733 --> 00:00:55.833
It seems real

26
00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:00.733
Did Zhang Wen Xu send you

27
00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.633
just to cause trouble for me?

28
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.066
If that's the case

29
00:01:04.666 --> 00:01:06.066
then I'll personally give you the title of Mrs. Zhang 

30
00:01:06.066 --> 00:01:07.233
and find another chance to kick you out

31
00:01:07.566 --> 00:01:10.066
Look closely, have you seen enough?

32
00:01:12.066 --> 00:01:13.166
Should I personally call Mr. Zhang?

33
00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.566
and have him tell you himself

34
00:01:15.566 --> 00:01:16.833
who the real Mrs. Zhang is?

35
00:01:16.833 --> 00:01:18.600
Oh, no need, no need

36
00:01:19.633 --> 00:01:21.866
We all believe you're Mrs. Zhang

37
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.566
Your unmatched presence 

38
00:01:23.566 --> 00:01:24.600
cannot be imitated

39
00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:27.666
At least you have good eyes

40
00:01:28.366 --> 00:01:30.400
I don't want to see her in the company

41
00:01:30.833 --> 00:01:31.666
Do you understand me?
