00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:01.066
Jian Dao,

2
00:00:01.433 --> 00:00:02.833
don’t push your luck.

3
00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:04.833
Is it so hard to have a meal?

4
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:05.700
Zhang Wen Xu,

5
00:00:06.066 --> 00:00:07.566
I find you ridiculous.

6
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:09.400
Zhi Han is already 6 years old.

7
00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:11.433
And you still don’t remember that she’s allergic to seafood?

8
00:00:13.266 --> 00:00:14.266
A father like you

9
00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:16.233
is really responsible.

10
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.300
Oh, this kid…

11
00:00:21.133 --> 00:00:22.000
You can't eat seafood,

12
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.233
why didn’t you say so earlier?

13
00:00:24.466 --> 00:00:25.633
Didn’t say so earlier?

14
00:00:26.233 --> 00:00:27.433
I’ve told you many times,

15
00:00:27.433 --> 00:00:28.100
did you remember?

16
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:29.100
Zhang Wen Xu,

17
00:00:29.466 --> 00:00:31.100
you only think about yourself.

18
00:00:31.733 --> 00:00:32.666
Why don’t you just say it?

19
00:00:33.233 --> 00:00:34.100
Why did you call me here today?

20
00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:35.133
What’s the point?

21
00:00:36.133 --> 00:00:36.833
Just to have a meal.

22
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:39.433
A meal?

23
00:00:40.933 --> 00:00:41.633
Zhi Han,

24
00:00:42.633 --> 00:00:43.500
I don’t blame you.

25
00:00:44.033 --> 00:00:45.133
I’ve been too busy before

26
00:00:45.133 --> 00:00:46.666
and didn’t have time to learn about your tastes.

27
00:00:46.966 --> 00:00:47.400
How about this:

28
00:00:47.633 --> 00:00:48.300
from now on, Dad

29
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.733
will take you out for delicious food, okay?

30
00:00:49.833 --> 00:00:50.233
Okay.

31
00:00:51.066 --> 00:00:51.933
Zhang Wen Xu,

32
00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:53.433
don’t even think about it.

33
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:55.700
Looks like Mom

34
00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:56.600
doesn’t really want

35
00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.100
Zhi Han to stay with Dad.

36
00:00:58.833 --> 00:00:59.166
No.

37
00:00:59.333 --> 00:01:00.666
Mom is a bad mom.

38
00:01:00.666 --> 00:01:02.500
I want to stay with Dad.

39
00:01:02.733 --> 00:01:03.433
Zhang Zhi Han,

40
00:01:03.966 --> 00:01:05.066
are you being disobedient?

41
00:01:06.666 --> 00:01:07.300
Zhi Han,

42
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.700
do you want to live with Dad?

43
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:10.433
Yes.

44
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:15.233
Zhi Han,

45
00:01:15.733 --> 00:01:16.800
you don’t need Mom anymore?

46
00:01:17.166 --> 00:01:18.500
You don’t want to go home with Mom?

47
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:18.933
No,

48
00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:20.833
an empty room isn’t a home.

49
00:01:21.066 --> 00:01:22.500
Dad’s house is home.

50
00:01:23.266 --> 00:01:23.766
Good girl.

51
00:01:24.433 --> 00:01:24.766
Come on,

52
00:01:25.333 --> 00:01:25.800
let's eat.
