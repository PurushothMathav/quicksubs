00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:00.966
You’re talking nonsense,

2
00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:03.566
freedom has nothing to do with children.

3
00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:05.466
It does.

4
00:00:05.733 --> 00:00:07.766
Just because you divorced me,

5
00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:09.300
Zhi Han

6
00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:10.866
is isolated at school,

7
00:00:10.966 --> 00:00:12.733
being called an illegitimate child without a father.

8
00:00:14.833 --> 00:00:16.500
I thought you could take care of her,

9
00:00:17.166 --> 00:00:18.033
but I was wrong.

10
00:00:18.266 --> 00:00:19.866
I’ve tried so hard to care for her,

11
00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.300
and now she has psychological issues.

12
00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:23.266
Did you know that?

13
00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:24.733
What did you say?

14
00:00:25.133 --> 00:00:26.233
What psychological issues?

15
00:00:28.033 --> 00:00:29.666
You didn’t even know.

16
00:00:29.766 --> 00:00:30.966
Because of your work,

17
00:00:31.366 --> 00:00:32.766
you don’t even know

18
00:00:32.766 --> 00:00:34.800
how to be a mother.

19
00:00:36.866 --> 00:00:37.566
Could it be

20
00:00:37.933 --> 00:00:39.533
that I’m really wrong?

21
00:00:39.666 --> 00:00:40.466
As expected,

22
00:00:40.566 --> 00:00:42.200
as long as I use the child to bind you,

23
00:00:42.333 --> 00:00:44.566
you’ll still become a puppet in my hands.

24
00:00:45.066 --> 00:00:45.766
Jian Dao,

25
00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:47.033
do you know?

26
00:00:47.166 --> 00:00:48.033
In this world,

27
00:00:48.133 --> 00:00:50.733
everyone has their duties and responsibilities.

28
00:00:50.833 --> 00:00:52.200
Among those responsibilities,

29
00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.700
there’s also the duty of a homemaker.

30
00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:56.566
And you

31
00:00:57.566 --> 00:01:00.833
shouldn’t resist this homemaker identity.

32
00:01:01.166 --> 00:01:02.333
You can do it.

33
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:06.000
Becoming a homemaker who doesn’t worry about food and clothing,

34
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.633
just taking care of the family well,

35
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.300
this is your duty and responsibility.

36
00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.266
This is your destiny.

37
00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:15.766
No.

38
00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:17.533
It’s not like that.

39
00:01:17.533 --> 00:01:18.933
It is like that.

40
00:01:28.366 --> 00:01:29.200
Hello, Secretary Li.

41
00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:31.766
Do what I said immediately.

42
00:01:38.466 --> 00:01:39.300
Why haven’t they come out?

43
00:01:39.766 --> 00:01:40.766
Could something have happened?
