00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:02.500
At Li Shi, we always value

2
00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:04.433
the character and family values of our partners

3
00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:05.700
Mr. Zhang,

4
00:00:06.166 --> 00:00:07.633
you've truly opened my eyes

5
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:09.933
I've been friends with Mrs. Zhang for many years

6
00:00:10.333 --> 00:00:11.666
Out of respect for her

7
00:00:11.933 --> 00:00:12.900
I gave you this opportunity

8
00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:14.300
Zhang Wen Xu,

9
00:00:14.733 --> 00:00:15.733
you've disappointed me greatly

10
00:00:16.133 --> 00:00:16.966
President Li

11
00:00:16.966 --> 00:00:17.233
You...

12
00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:19.133
If you want to continue, fine

13
00:00:19.266 --> 00:00:20.500
But you must meet one of my demands

14
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.066
As long as someone in my family can do it

15
00:00:24.066 --> 00:00:25.233
I will make sure it gets done

16
00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:27.000
I want to bring Mrs. Zhang

17
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:27.866
to Li Shi Group

18
00:00:27.866 --> 00:00:28.933
to complete this project

19
00:00:29.066 --> 00:00:29.800
until it's finished

20
00:00:30.033 --> 00:00:31.133
That won't do

21
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:32.766
She hasn't been out in years

22
00:00:32.766 --> 00:00:33.900
She's definitely not capable

23
00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:35.300
How do you know I'm not capable?

24
00:00:36.433 --> 00:00:36.933
President Li,

25
00:00:37.433 --> 00:00:38.266
looking forward to working with you

26
00:00:39.233 --> 00:00:39.866
Alright

27
00:00:40.166 --> 00:00:42.133
Li Shi Group welcomes Miss Jian

28
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:50.566
How did this happen?

29
00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:52.533
Wen Xu, don't be angry

30
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.566
I don't know why this happened either

31
00:00:54.566 --> 00:00:56.133
But Aunt was lying on the bed

32
00:00:56.133 --> 00:00:57.133
in the Zhang family home

33
00:00:57.133 --> 00:00:57.966
We've lost all face,

34
00:00:57.966 --> 00:00:59.466
so many people, my mother

35
00:01:00.366 --> 00:01:01.133
I know

36
00:01:01.133 --> 00:01:02.166
We didn't expect

37
00:01:02.166 --> 00:01:03.166
Aunt to end up there either

38
00:01:03.166 --> 00:01:04.566
What can you do?

39
00:01:04.733 --> 00:01:05.466
You're asked to do something

40
00:01:05.466 --> 00:01:06.400
and you can do it well

41
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:07.900
But did you do it well?

42
00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:09.800
What do you mean by something I can do well?

43
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.133
Who drugged her?

44
00:01:14.333 --> 00:01:15.333
Let's not talk about that anymore

45
00:01:16.766 --> 00:01:18.266
No, isn't it strange?

46
00:01:18.266 --> 00:01:20.233
How could she suddenly change like that today?

47
00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:21.566
Right

48
00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:23.766
That damn fat woman

49
00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:25.866
How did she find out about our plan?

50
00:01:26.233 --> 00:01:28.100
If you want to know something, ask me

51
00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:31.600
Talking behind my back, how can I answer you?
