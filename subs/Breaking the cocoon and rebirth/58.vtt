1
00:00:09.733 --> 00:00:11.700
Did you come to the company to work

2
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.000
or to enjoy yourself?

3
00:00:15.666 --> 00:00:16.633
Mrs. Zhang, are you alright?

4
00:00:16.866 --> 00:00:17.666
You're crazy

5
00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:20.300
Mrs. Zhang is right

6
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.700
Who comes to the company and doesn't work?

7
00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.033
If I remember correctly

8
00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:26.166
In two days, Mr. Li 

9
00:00:26.166 --> 00:00:27.633
will come to review the bidding proposal

10
00:00:28.233 --> 00:00:28.900
You should think 

11
00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:30.400
about what you should be doing now

12
00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:32.833
These 

13
00:00:33.133 --> 00:00:35.500
are all bidding customer materials

14
00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.233
Now they're all wet because of you

15
00:00:38.033 --> 00:00:39.600
If they get leaked

16
00:00:40.433 --> 00:00:42.433
None of you can bear the consequences

17
00:00:50.933 --> 00:00:53.766
It seems this is what Wen Xu needs

18
00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:02.700
Why did you hurt yourself?

19
00:01:06.333 --> 00:01:07.400
I've heard

20
00:01:07.866 --> 00:01:08.833
She pretended to be you

21
00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:10.566
Why didn't you come to me to clear things up?

22
00:01:11.266 --> 00:01:12.200
I didn't expect 

23
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.400
Jiang Yu Yong could be so stupid

24
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:14.833
To dare impersonate me

25
00:01:15.433 --> 00:01:16.366
What do you want to do?

26
00:01:17.933 --> 00:01:19.366
Make them feel 

27
00:01:19.366 --> 00:01:20.800
that they've already won

28
00:01:21.133 --> 00:01:22.866
That way, they'll believe what I say

29
00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:24.300
Only then can Zhang Wen Xu 

30
00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:25.266
ruin his reputation

31
00:01:25.266 --> 00:01:26.400
because of this bidding project

32
00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.100
Actually, there's no need for this trouble

33
00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:31.500
I can help you take care of them

34
00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.200
You can help me once, twice

35
00:01:34.533 --> 00:01:35.700
but you can't help me for life

36
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:36.900
Why not?

37
00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:38.233
As long as you want

38
00:01:38.233 --> 00:01:39.400
I can help you for life

39
00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.133
I don't want that

40
00:01:44.933 --> 00:01:47.266
I want to take revenge by myself

41
00:01:48.933 --> 00:01:50.300
I won't let them benefit

42
00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.266
I'll head back first

43
00:02:03.066 --> 00:02:03.966
Jian Dao

44
00:02:05.866 --> 00:02:07.533
Give back what you stole from me
