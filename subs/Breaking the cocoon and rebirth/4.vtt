00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:09.266
Zhi Han,

2
00:00:09.266 --> 00:00:11.066
First, play in the living room by yourself for a bit

3
00:00:11.066 --> 00:00:12.766
Mom has something to discuss with Dad

4
00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.666
Yes

5
00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:33.500
Hurry up, 

6
00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:34.666
she's coming back soon

7
00:00:49.866 --> 00:00:50.700
Why did you come back?

8
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.333
So you were hiding here

9
00:00:55.333 --> 00:00:56.266
We're doomed

10
00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:57.566
Is everything okay?

11
00:00:57.566 --> 00:00:58.566
Yes, no problem

12
00:00:59.733 --> 00:01:01.766
Why are the clothes under the bed?

13
00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:05.566
I'll pick them up

14
00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:13.500
Today

15
00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.166
Today was exhausting

16
00:01:15.166 --> 00:01:15.966
Ahem

17
00:01:17.266 --> 00:01:18.100
Is everything okay?

18
00:01:19.933 --> 00:01:20.533
No, no, no 

19
00:01:20.533 --> 00:01:21.233
everything's fine

20
00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:22.033
Lately

21
00:01:22.666 --> 00:01:23.666
Work at the company has been

22
00:01:23.666 --> 00:01:24.333
a bit

23
00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:24.866
tiring

24
00:01:25.866 --> 00:01:26.300
Really?

25
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.133
Husband?

26
00:01:27.766 --> 00:01:29.000
Let's get a new bed

27
00:01:29.466 --> 00:01:31.400
I always feel like this bed

28
00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:32.966
isn't very clean

29
00:01:33.366 --> 00:01:35.433
As if another woman has slept in it

30
00:01:36.866 --> 00:01:39.266
You're overthinking it

31
00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.100
The clock fell
