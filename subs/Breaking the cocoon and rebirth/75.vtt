00:00:02.566 --> 00:00:03.200
Zhang Wen Xu,

2
00:00:03.733 --> 00:00:04.466
come outside with me.

3
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:10.666
Everyone, eat first.

4
00:00:19.166 --> 00:00:19.966
You see,

5
00:00:20.566 --> 00:00:21.233
Even if we let Zhi Han

6
00:00:21.233 --> 00:00:22.700
choose between us,

7
00:00:22.933 --> 00:00:24.666
She would still choose me.

8
00:00:25.266 --> 00:00:25.733
Why?

9
00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:27.666
Zhang Wen Xu,

10
00:00:28.333 --> 00:00:30.566
what exactly did you say to Zhi Han?

11
00:00:32.633 --> 00:00:34.800
Don’t think of me so poorly.

12
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.200
I’ve never said anything

13
00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.466
bad about you in front of her.

14
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.966
Instead of thinking that way about me,

15
00:00:39.966 --> 00:00:41.566
why don’t you think a bit

16
00:00:41.566 --> 00:00:43.500
about why Zhi Han is so resistant?

17
00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.633
Try reflecting on yourself.

18
00:00:46.266 --> 00:00:47.100
What do you mean?

19
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:48.566
You see,

20
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.766
even if my mother hates her,

21
00:00:52.766 --> 00:00:54.100
even if that little fat kid bullies her,

22
00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:55.333
she still prefers to stay here.

23
00:00:55.333 --> 00:00:56.033
Why is that?

24
00:00:56.766 --> 00:00:57.666
Jian Dao,

25
00:00:58.266 --> 00:00:59.400
you’re so smart,

26
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:00.900
why not think about it yourself?

27
00:01:04.066 --> 00:01:04.866
In this world,

28
00:01:04.866 --> 00:01:06.600
you can’t have both fish and bear’s paw.

29
00:01:06.833 --> 00:01:09.100
You want both freedom and children,

30
00:01:09.133 --> 00:01:10.933
how can you have both?

31
00:01:17.066 --> 00:01:18.100
Why haven’t they come out yet?
