00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.766
Let's invite the CEO of Li Shi Group

2
00:00:02.166 --> 00:00:02.766
President Li

3
00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:03.633
to the stage

4
00:00:07.366 --> 00:00:08.433
Thank you very much

5
00:00:08.533 --> 00:00:10.766
Li Shi Group is able to entrust this project

6
00:00:10.766 --> 00:00:12.933
to our Jian An Group

7
00:00:21.466 --> 00:00:21.900
What? 

8
00:00:22.433 --> 00:00:23.500
Did you really see Mrs. Zhang

9
00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:24.533
go into the room with someone?

10
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:25.766
Mrs. Zhang

11
00:00:25.766 --> 00:00:26.966
Cheating on Mr. Zhang?

12
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:27.300
Could be

13
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:28.366
Let's go see

14
00:00:33.466 --> 00:00:34.033
Baby

15
00:00:34.433 --> 00:00:35.366
I love you so much

16
00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:36.466
Who's inside?

17
00:00:36.966 --> 00:00:37.633
Come out

18
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.766
Don't hide 

19
00:00:41.266 --> 00:00:42.066
Open the door

20
00:00:43.766 --> 00:00:45.000
Go get the key for me

21
00:00:45.366 --> 00:00:45.733
Mr. Zhang,

22
00:00:45.733 --> 00:00:47.233
Are you sure you want to bring so many people in?

23
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:48.600
Will Mrs. Zhang agree...

24
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:49.800
Go get it when I tell you to

25
00:00:50.033 --> 00:00:51.066
If Jian Dao dares to do it,

26
00:00:51.066 --> 00:00:52.300
why would she fear people talking?

27
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.500
Are you really sure that Mrs. Zhang

28
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:55.600
went in with a man?

29
00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.300
Mrs. Zhang,

30
00:00:57.633 --> 00:01:00.033
you still look so charming

31
00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.200
I love you to death

32
00:01:03.166 --> 00:01:04.066
Mrs. Zhang

33
00:01:04.066 --> 00:01:05.966
Could it really be Jian Dao in there?

34
00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.600
No way, is it really Mrs. Zhang in there?

35
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:10.866
I told you, why did Mrs. Zhang

36
00:01:10.866 --> 00:01:11.833
suddenly disappear?

37
00:01:11.833 --> 00:01:13.433
Turns out she went to see her old lover

38
00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.666
I didn't expect her to be so romantic behind the scenes

39
00:01:15.666 --> 00:01:16.733
How will Mr. Zhang face people

40
00:01:16.733 --> 00:01:17.866
in Jiangcheng in the future?

41
00:01:18.833 --> 00:01:19.533
I didn't expect this

42
00:01:20.466 --> 00:01:21.633
All these years, I've worked

43
00:01:21.633 --> 00:01:23.166
so hard for this

44
00:01:23.166 --> 00:01:24.166
For what?

45
00:01:24.166 --> 00:01:25.133
I worked so hard

46
00:01:25.133 --> 00:01:26.266
so that my wife and children

47
00:01:26.266 --> 00:01:27.433
could have a good life

48
00:01:27.733 --> 00:01:29.133
I didn't expect her to treat me like this

49
00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:30.933
Does she deserve me?

50
00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:32.433
Exactly,

51
00:01:32.433 --> 00:01:33.433
Mrs. Zhang used to be

52
00:01:33.433 --> 00:01:34.766
a 200-pound fat woman

53
00:01:34.766 --> 00:01:35.866
President Zhang didn't abandon her

54
00:01:36.366 --> 00:01:38.133
In the old days, this kind of woman

55
00:01:38.133 --> 00:01:39.266
would have been drowned in a pig cage

56
00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:41.266
Open the door

57
00:01:41.666 --> 00:01:42.433
Jian Dao,

58
00:01:42.766 --> 00:01:44.133
do you think you deserve me?

59
00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:45.300
Do you deserve our child?

60
00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.300
Do you deserve to be a mother?

61
00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.266
Are you looking for me?

62
00:01:54.966 --> 00:01:57.200
Jian Dao? How is that possible?
