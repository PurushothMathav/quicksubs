00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:01.366
Call the police

2
00:00:01.366 --> 00:00:02.433
She stabbed someone with a pen 

3
00:00:02.433 --> 00:00:03.533
isn't that enough?

4
00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:04.933
Jian Dao

5
00:00:05.333 --> 00:00:06.833
Either you pack up and leave on your own

6
00:00:07.033 --> 00:00:07.800
Or we'll call the police

7
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:09.100
Call the police? 

8
00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:09.933
Go ahead

9
00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:12.133
Wait for the police to arrive

10
00:00:12.333 --> 00:00:14.566
At worst, I'll be charged with excessive self-defense

11
00:00:14.566 --> 00:00:15.500
And you all?

12
00:00:16.466 --> 00:00:17.433
Intentional harm

13
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:18.966
Workplace bullying

14
00:00:19.333 --> 00:00:20.700
Harassment at work

15
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:22.633
These things 

16
00:00:22.866 --> 00:00:26.100
I'll tell the police and the press, one by one

17
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.866
Then we'll see who suffers more

18
00:00:33.033 --> 00:00:34.666
Why aren't you calling the police?

19
00:00:35.166 --> 00:00:35.833
Scared? 

20
00:00:36.433 --> 00:00:37.666
I'll call them for you

21
00:00:43.433 --> 00:00:45.666
Isn't that the bracelet Mrs. Zhang was looking for?

22
00:00:46.366 --> 00:00:47.333
My bracelet

23
00:00:48.466 --> 00:00:49.000
Jian Dao, 

24
00:00:49.233 --> 00:00:50.566
how dare you smash my bracelet?

25
00:00:50.933 --> 00:00:52.466
This bracelet is worth 3 million (*)
(*) ~ 10 billion

26
00:01:04.166 --> 00:01:04.333
Dad 

27
00:01:04.966 --> 00:01:06.700
prepared a birthday gift for you.

28
00:01:08.433 --> 00:01:08.933
Wow

29
00:01:09.633 --> 00:01:10.300
Do you like it? 

30
00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:11.300
I love it

31
00:01:12.066 --> 00:01:13.933
My name is even engraved on it?

32
00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:15.200
Happy birthday to you

33
00:01:15.666 --> 00:01:16.666
Thank you, Dad

34
00:01:21.666 --> 00:01:22.900
What are you staring at?

35
00:01:23.366 --> 00:01:25.000
Stealing a 3 million bracelet

36
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.400
is enough to get you jailed for 10 years

37
00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:32.166
This was clearly a birthday gift from my dad

38
00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.466
How did it end up with you?

39
00:01:34.233 --> 00:01:36.366
This was a 3-year anniversary gift from Wen Xu

40
00:01:36.566 --> 00:01:37.866
It originally belonged to me

41
00:01:38.033 --> 00:01:39.800
This is clearly my bracelet
