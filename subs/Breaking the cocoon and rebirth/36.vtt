00:00:03.233 --> 00:00:05.133
Can you believe how competent Manager Jian is?

2
00:00:05.133 --> 00:00:06.333
She’s only been here for two days

3
00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:07.400
and she’s already secured two big orders

4
00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:08.666
Don’t you know?

5
00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:10.600
Her entry into Li Shi wasn’t exactly legitimate

6
00:00:10.866 --> 00:00:14.366
What do you mean by that?

7
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:15.766
You really don’t know?

8
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:17.433
You can’t judge a book by its cover

9
00:00:17.433 --> 00:00:18.966
"Climb to the top" is all it takes

10
00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:21.500
Is that true?

11
00:00:21.866 --> 00:00:23.033
It’s true, I even have photos of her on my phone

12
00:00:23.033 --> 00:00:25.600
I feel like she doesn’t seem like that kind of person

13
00:00:25.633 --> 00:00:27.566
Let me add you to the group, there’s a lot of hot stuff in there

14
00:00:34.233 --> 00:00:35.800
No way, she looks too good like this

15
00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.333
Her figure is too hot

16
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:38.266
Alright, see you later

17
00:00:38.433 --> 00:00:39.566
By the way, you probably don’t know

18
00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.733
She’s also Zhang’s ex-wife

19
00:00:42.633 --> 00:00:44.000
So that’s her?

20
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.200
Moreover, I heard 

21
00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.400
after one party, she and Li 

22
00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:48.800
ended up together

23
00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:52.166
Go on, tell me more

24
00:00:52.166 --> 00:00:53.133
Look at this

25
00:00:53.133 --> 00:00:54.166
This one too, 

26
00:00:54.166 --> 00:00:55.733
and this one, and more

27
00:00:56.633 --> 00:00:57.266
Right

28
00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.200
Why aren’t you saying anything?

29
00:01:08.966 --> 00:01:10.466
Manager Jian, we’re really sorry, 

30
00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:11.833
we shouldn’t have talked about you like that

31
00:01:11.833 --> 00:01:12.733
We’re really sorry

32
00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:14.333
What are you afraid of?

33
00:01:15.133 --> 00:01:16.766
I didn’t say anything

34
00:01:17.666 --> 00:01:18.333
Did you say anything?

35
00:01:18.533 --> 00:01:19.200
No, no

36
00:01:19.333 --> 00:01:20.100
Sorry, Manager Jian 

37
00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:21.400
I shouldn’t have said that about you 

38
00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:22.033
I’m really sorry

39
00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:23.566
Open the group chat

40
00:01:23.933 --> 00:01:24.733
Give me your phone

41
00:01:32.433 --> 00:01:33.033
Let go

42
00:01:41.733 --> 00:01:43.533
Do you know who the group leader is?

43
00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:45.400
I don’t know, I don’t know

44
00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:46.100
It’s 

45
00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.100
all just some clone accounts of company employees

46
00:01:55.633 --> 00:01:56.300
1:00 AM, 

47
00:01:56.566 --> 00:01:57.933
add this number

48
00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:59.200
Got it?

49
00:01:59.633 --> 00:02:00.466
Got it

50
00:02:08.133 --> 00:02:09.600
You should all understand 

51
00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:10.500
what should be said 

52
00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:11.400
and what shouldn’t be said

53
00:02:12.133 --> 00:02:13.133
Understood

54
00:02:13.866 --> 00:02:14.400
Very good 

55
00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:15.466
I trust you

56
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.400
I hope you 

57
00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.233
don’t disappoint me 

58
00:02:19.466 --> 00:02:20.700
Otherwise, next time I come to you

59
00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:22.233
But it’s not just 

60
00:02:22.233 --> 00:02:24.433
about Manager Jian using her body to climb up

61
00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.600
Rumors won’t bring down that woman

62
00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:33.933
It really makes me angry

63
00:02:35.766 --> 00:02:36.533
Don’t worry, 

64
00:02:37.133 --> 00:02:37.833
I still have other ways
