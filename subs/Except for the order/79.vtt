00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:01.100
Here it is.

2
00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:06.466
Is that $100 billion contract real?

3
00:00:06.766 --> 00:00:07.800
Why don't you agree?

4
00:00:08.133 --> 00:00:10.400
Misu, are you sure?

5
00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:11.833
The previous 100 billion contracts

6
00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:13.700
I see you

7
00:00:14.333 --> 00:00:16.833
Will it be tens of billions or billions?

8
00:00:17.133 --> 00:00:20.166
Miss, the amount he wrote is written on the back.

9
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.300
How could I be wrong?

10
00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:23.500
100 billion

11
00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:25.600
It's really for me.

12
00:00:26.333 --> 00:00:27.800
Of course, really.

13
00:00:28.333 --> 00:00:30.566
They say Qi Tian is a liar

14
00:00:30.566 --> 00:00:34.166
100 billion, do you know how many collars are behind 100 billion?

15
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:35.400
You know

16
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.966
How many families can come up with 100 billion?

17
00:00:38.966 --> 00:00:42.033
All the directors here are the best of the business world

18
00:00:42.966 --> 00:00:45.000
Is this contract genuine?

19
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.100
Directors, please take a look for me.

20
00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:48.666
Naturally you will know

21
00:00:53.466 --> 00:00:54.266
Ah!

22
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.800
That's really Buddha's impression.

23
00:01:00.266 --> 00:01:01.500
This is the impression of the Buddha.

24
00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.100
This one is from the Lord himself

25
00:01:08.266 --> 00:01:10.400
Billions before royal business

26
00:01:11.566 --> 00:01:13.866
Easy enough to become chairperson

27
00:01:14.066 --> 00:01:14.866
Kiki

28
00:01:15.266 --> 00:01:17.433
You are a waste and a liar

29
00:01:17.766 --> 00:01:20.866
Directors, don't be deceived by him

30
00:01:20.866 --> 00:01:22.833
If you don't leave, I'll be alone

31
00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:27.400
Then don't blame me for the dead net crane
