00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.933
Compared to my love for Miss Tian Ke

28
00:01:16.933 --> 00:01:19.366
And that's the tip of the iceberg.

I wanted to wish Ake happiness in the future

38
00:01:41.333 --> 00:01:43.466
But since you want to marry a nest person

00:01:44.133 --> 00:01:45.566
I don't mind a one-on-one ratio
