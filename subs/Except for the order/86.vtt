00:00:00.566 --> 00:00:03.400
Ye Bingtao, why is he here?

2
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.500
I know it's him

3
00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:06.666
Ye Bingtao

4
00:00:07.133 --> 00:00:09.533
He won't come against our Tian family again, will he?

5
00:00:09.533 --> 00:00:10.633
What are you afraid of?

6
00:00:10.866 --> 00:00:15.066
When the sky falls, there is a tall one standing first

7
00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:16.366
He has to deal with it first

8
00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:19.833
I have to deal with that Italian Daxing family first

9
00:00:20.533 --> 00:00:21.600
Who is this guy?

10
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:22.966
Is he here to make trouble?

11
00:00:23.066 --> 00:00:25.433
Ran out of this mental hospital, right?

12
00:00:25.533 --> 00:00:27.166
Buy everything for a penny

13
00:00:27.166 --> 00:00:28.566
Dream on

14
00:00:30.366 --> 00:00:31.900
Introduce yourself

15
00:00:32.066 --> 00:00:33.566
I am Ye Mintao.

16
00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.266
The only heir to the Ye family in the capital

17
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.900
He is also the future chairperson of the Night Market Group

18
00:00:41.066 --> 00:00:43.966
Ye Mintao, don't talk nonsense

19
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.300
I am the chairperson of the night market group

20
00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:48.433
Haha, not bad.

21
00:00:48.766 --> 00:00:50.566
You are indeed the chairperson

22
00:00:50.666 --> 00:00:52.266
But what about tomorrow and the day after?

23
00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:54.100
Don't you forget.

24
00:00:54.133 --> 00:00:57.500
Half of the shares of Ye's Group are in the hands of the old man

25
00:00:57.666 --> 00:00:59.800
He has been missing for several days

26
00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.233
Probably dead

27
00:01:03.533 --> 00:01:05.066
The old man didn't make a will

28
00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:08.733
Everything that punishes him according to inheritance is mine

29
00:01:08.733 --> 00:01:10.300
Grandpa will be fine

30
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.833
He's going to be okay.

31
00:01:14.666 --> 00:01:16.100
Hahaha

32
00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.100
You don't even believe yourself when you say that.

33
00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.000
I am now

34
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.600
The identity of the future chairperson of the Group

35
00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.566
Ask you again

36
00:01:27.966 --> 00:01:29.800
I pay a penny

37
00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.400
Buy all the assets you're auctioning off today

38
00:01:34.133 --> 00:01:37.600
Does anyone have any doubts?
