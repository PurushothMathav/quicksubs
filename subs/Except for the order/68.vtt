1
00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.366
I saved you. Here we go again.

2
00:00:02.366 --> 00:00:03.766
Qi Tian, shut up

3
00:00:04.166 --> 00:00:05.200
What's wrong with him?

4
00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:08.966
Nothing. It could be BTSD

5
00:00:09.166 --> 00:00:10.066
Miss Ye

6
00:00:10.133 --> 00:00:12.666
You must have let Wei Chengzhu drive Ye Bingtao away

7
00:00:12.666 --> 00:00:14.400
And saved me by the way, right?

8
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:15.666
Miss Tian

9
00:00:15.933 --> 00:00:18.500
Oh, his analysis makes sense.

10
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:19.600
As soon as you say

11
00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:23.100
The health master said that this sea dragon palace villa is not his

12
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.100
That must be yours, Miss Ye

13
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.000
In fact, Miss Tian

14
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.033
I know you don't ask for anything in return

15
00:00:30.166 --> 00:00:33.666
But I will always remember this kindness in my heart

16
00:00:36.466 --> 00:00:39.100
It seems that the electricity bill has finally been drawn.

17
00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:40.966
Xitian, don't laugh at me

18
00:00:41.133 --> 00:00:43.700
You lied to me just now that you saved me

19
00:00:43.866 --> 00:00:46.033
I'm still getting slapped in the face.

20
00:00:46.266 --> 00:00:47.533
What a liar

21
00:00:47.533 --> 00:00:49.866
Miss Ye Qi Tian, he is a liar

22
00:00:49.866 --> 00:00:52.766
He doesn't deserve you at all, so leave him now

23
00:00:54.133 --> 00:00:55.833
Where did you say you were going?

24
00:00:56.133 --> 00:00:57.600
I go back to my room to eat

25
00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.900
I don't want to eat with brainless people

26
00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:02.566
It's all your fault today

27
00:01:02.566 --> 00:01:04.366
Your assistant is pissed off by you

28
00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.700
Miss Tian, I find you are really talented.
