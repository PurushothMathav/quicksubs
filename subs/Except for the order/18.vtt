00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:01.200
Bright Sun

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:02.800
You lose.

3
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:04.100
Bright Sun

4
00:00:04.566 --> 00:00:06.300
You lose today

5
00:00:08.566 --> 00:00:11.800
I knew you really cared about me

6
00:00:12.733 --> 00:00:14.100
Oh look

7
00:00:14.133 --> 00:00:16.233
I won marry me

8
00:00:20.966 --> 00:00:21.800
Really?

9
00:00:22.533 --> 00:00:23.333
OK

10
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.666
When are you going back with me to see grandpa?

11
00:00:29.133 --> 00:00:30.500
Haicheng is in a hurry

12
00:00:30.733 --> 00:00:32.200
We'll go back when we're done.

13
00:00:40.166 --> 00:00:43.033
Qi Tian, what are you doing here?

14
00:00:43.933 --> 00:00:45.000
It's not your turn

15
00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:50.233
Is Mr. Qi going to call?

16
00:00:50.333 --> 00:00:51.500
You don't need to know him in general

17
00:00:51.533 --> 00:00:53.100
Wait a minute yourself

18
00:00:53.533 --> 00:00:56.066
Sister, don't be deceived by him

19
00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.500
He's not Mr. Strange

20
00:00:58.533 --> 00:01:01.066
He's a martial arts dropout

21
00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:02.500
Deceitful poor ghost

22
00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:06.166
Yesterday, you lied to me with a bunch of street stalls

23
00:01:06.166 --> 00:01:08.266
The marriage was annulled by our Tian family on the spot

24
00:01:08.266 --> 00:01:11.233
Mr. Qi was divorced by the Tian family
