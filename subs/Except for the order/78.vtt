1
00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:02.166
Because the last board meeting

2
00:00:02.566 --> 00:00:05.366
I took out 10 billion big order

3
00:00:05.366 --> 00:00:09.966
10 billion 10 billion bundle of foreign trade orders

4
00:00:10.333 --> 00:00:12.733
Prove Mr. Ye's network resources

5
00:00:12.733 --> 00:00:14.033
And trading capabilities

6
00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:15.800
Is extremely registered

7
00:00:15.866 --> 00:00:17.266
I believe

8
00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:20.066
Only Mr. Ye can lead us to the night market

9
00:00:20.333 --> 00:00:21.066
Further development

10
00:00:21.066 --> 00:00:21.866
Conquest

11
00:00:22.333 --> 00:00:23.766
Again fruitless

12
00:00:23.766 --> 00:00:26.500
Lao Wang, but this human body is open

13
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:28.766
Management ability also has a promising future

14
00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.166
I think that's a fact.

15
00:00:32.266 --> 00:00:33.066
Lao Tie

16
00:00:33.533 --> 00:00:34.800
The mall is not present

17
00:00:35.266 --> 00:00:38.866
And sometimes you need a building block.

18
00:00:39.466 --> 00:00:41.700
The price of others is a bad thing

19
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.400
As for management skills?

20
00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:44.966
We can be inspector general

21
00:00:45.333 --> 00:00:47.300
Avoid him making another mistake in the apartment

22
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.100
I won't support it anyway

23
00:00:49.366 --> 00:00:52.600
The disappearance of the old chairperson may be related to him

24
00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.300
If so

25
00:00:54.466 --> 00:00:56.200
We had to vote

26
00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.766
Please raise your hand in support of the performance

27
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.266
How is it, niece?

28
00:01:05.933 --> 00:01:07.466
Just your little wit

29
00:01:08.466 --> 00:01:10.066
You can't beat 25.

30
00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:11.666
Directors

31
00:01:11.666 --> 00:01:12.533
I promise

32
00:01:12.533 --> 00:01:15.300
I'll get 10 billion contract in a year

33
00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:17.200
Sorry Miss Yi

34
00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.033
We don't want promises.

35
00:01:19.166 --> 00:01:20.633
We want a contract

36
00:01:20.933 --> 00:01:24.200
Unless you can come up with a contract worth over 10 billion now

37
00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.833
Otherwise, I can only announce that Mr. Ye Bingtao

38
00:01:27.866 --> 00:01:28.766
serve as chairperson

39
00:01:29.666 --> 00:01:30.100
Now.

40
00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:32.300
How can you get a contract worth over 10 billion yuan?

41
00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:34.500
Why is it impossible for Mr. Wang?

42
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.600
Remember this?
