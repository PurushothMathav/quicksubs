Grandpa, what's wrong with your leg?

2
00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:05.766
How can you be okay if I get in the way?

00:00:09.766 --> 00:00:11.233
How dare you have privacy

4
00:00:12.266 --> 00:00:15.833
You've lost all your face.

5
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.400
Dad, I was wrong.

6
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.400
I'll just watch my dad forgive us for a while

7
00:00:21.466 --> 00:00:23.266
You not only sent someone to frame Ye Lao

00:00:23.266 --> 00:00:24.866
Also colluded with me

9
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.566
Even if he could forgive you

10
00:00:26.566 --> 00:00:28.066
I can't forgive you either.

11
00:00:28.066 --> 00:00:29.600
How could he collude with me?

12
00:00:31.733 --> 00:00:33.033

00:00:34.066 --> 00:00:38.600

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:52.400
Grandpa

18
00:00:52.866 --> 00:00:54.433
I will never let you down

19
00:00:55.866 --> 00:00:57.800
What have you been doing these days?

20
00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.566
I've heard that's good

21
00:01:02.166 --> 00:01:03.000

22
00:01:03.933 --> 00:01:05.600
The questions are also good

You want me to go to jail?

28
00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:27.266
Well, since you don't want me to be better off

29
00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:29.833
Then don't blame me

30
00:01:30.466 --> 00:01:32.566
Do you think you have a way out?

31
00:01:33.533 --> 00:01:35.233
