00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:01.900
Qi Tian is in his prime

2
00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:03.266
Not a night market group

3
00:00:03.333 --> 00:00:05.366
It's not something you can point to.

4
00:00:05.566 --> 00:00:06.766
Tell you what?

5
00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:08.000
My Tian Ke

6
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.100
I'm about to marry Ding Sheng's former vice president

7
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:13.033
You, get out of here

8
00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:17.100
Maybe the vice president will come a while ago and let you go

9
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.166
Then we'll see who gets beaten out in a while

10
00:00:21.166 --> 00:00:22.166
West Sky

11
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.500
You don't think you've helped Miss Ye

12
00:00:24.733 --> 00:00:26.500
You can get carried away

13
00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:27.800
Have you ever considered

14
00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.200
If one day he realizes your true colors

15
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.633
How will you end up?

16
00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:32.633
I see it

17
00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.000
Maybe Miss Ye has already seen through him

18
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.766
Today, I came here to find a job

19
00:00:39.766 --> 00:00:42.100
You want to try your best to get close to your ex-husband

20
00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45.000
While laughing at me, I fell in love with Miss Ye

21
00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:49.466
Can I understand that this is not eating grapes?

22
00:00:49.566 --> 00:00:51.066
Can't say sour

23
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.800
Former Vice President, you are here

24
00:00:53.866 --> 00:00:56.400
Who is it? I'm Brother Tian's mother

25
00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.300
You see I brought him to you

26
00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.300
Miss Tian really looks better than in the photo.

27
00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:03.600
Our brother Tian

28
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.633
I have admired you for a long time

29
00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:10.400
Hello Vice President Chen

30
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:15.600
Brother-in-law early

31
00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:18.600
There is a little problem with our Tian family capital chain.

32
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.566
Can you hey?

33
00:01:20.966 --> 00:01:22.666
300 million.

34
00:01:22.666 --> 00:01:23.600
OK.

35
00:01:24.166 --> 00:01:26.600
Come on, let's talk in the office
