1
00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:03.033
Tianke, you have not become a full member yet.

2
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.633
The indulged brother sows discord and creates a team

3
00:00:05.733 --> 00:00:09.466
If you join the Haicheng Chamber of Commerce, there will be no peace

4
00:00:09.466 --> 00:00:10.400
So I decided.

5
00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.900
Abolish Tian Ke's qualification to join the Haicheng Chamber of Commerce

6
00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.566
Miss Yan was actually rejected

7
00:00:14.566 --> 00:00:16.866
The party is guilty of self-understanding, so you can't keep such a person.

8
00:00:16.866 --> 00:00:18.300
Many acts of injustice will lead to self-isolation

9
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.266
President, I was wrong.

10
00:00:20.566 --> 00:00:21.533
Please take back your life

11
00:00:21.533 --> 00:00:23.766
The person you want to admit is Qi Xian

12
00:00:24.266 --> 00:00:25.066
Qi Tian

13
00:00:25.366 --> 00:00:28.300
Do you have to kill us all?

14
00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:30.766
It's all your fault

15
00:00:32.733 --> 00:00:35.366
Ok my god

16
00:00:37.666 --> 00:00:39.900
All your shame today

17
00:00:40.566 --> 00:00:42.700
Slow down Jiang Yonghui

18
00:00:42.966 --> 00:00:44.600
Do you want to question my decision?

19
00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.133
Dear Tian family, under the leadership of Miss Tian

20
00:00:47.133 --> 00:00:48.766
Assets have exceeded 3 billion

21
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.933
Than most of the Chamber members here

22
00:00:50.933 --> 00:00:52.600
And it's very virtual.

23
00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:53.700
Such a talented person

24
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:54.766
Such a powerful partner

25
00:00:54.766 --> 00:00:55.966
Are we going to live outside the door?

26
00:00:55.966 --> 00:00:59.033
Vice Chairperson Jiang, you actually opposed Chairperson Liang for me

27
00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:00.400
Objection is nothing

28
00:01:00.466 --> 00:01:03.833
Liang thought that in order to maintain Qi Tian, it was unreasonable

29
00:01:03.866 --> 00:01:05.400
He doesn't deserve to be president at all
