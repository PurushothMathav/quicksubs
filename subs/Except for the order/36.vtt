00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:01.500
Why didn't you take it out just now?

2
00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:02.733
From start to finish

3
00:00:02.733 --> 00:00:04.400
Did any of you ask me?

4
00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:06.466
Is there any invitation letter?

5
00:00:06.466 --> 00:00:07.966
Sure enough, it's your real invitation.

6
00:00:07.966 --> 00:00:08.666
Oh, really?

7
00:00:08.666 --> 00:00:11.500
Really? It really is. It really is.

8
00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:12.400
Again

9
00:00:12.933 --> 00:00:14.366
Just hold the invitation

10
00:00:14.733 --> 00:00:15.933
Would you believe it?

11
00:00:15.933 --> 00:00:18.800
In your heart I have always been

12
00:00:19.066 --> 00:00:20.900
All poor

13
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.966
Liar, right?

14
00:00:22.966 --> 00:00:24.833
Because because you have been

15
00:00:24.866 --> 00:00:26.000
What I did to you

16
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.366
You're lying to me!

17
00:00:27.366 --> 00:00:29.766
Okay, since I cheated you first

18
00:00:29.766 --> 00:00:32.700
Then I'll show you if I'm lying to you.

19
00:00:32.933 --> 00:00:36.600
Do you have any colleagues in the jewelry industry?

20
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.033
Next week, we will officially notify the jewelry industry.

21
00:00:39.133 --> 00:00:39.966
All right.

22
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:41.433
Boss Zhou

23
00:00:41.566 --> 00:00:44.300
Please help me see if this ring is genuine.

24
00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.500
Why is there only one new ring of true love?

25
00:00:46.933 --> 00:00:47.733
one

26
00:00:48.566 --> 00:00:49.433
Here I am.

27
00:00:53.666 --> 00:00:55.766
These two are indeed genuine.

28
00:00:55.766 --> 00:00:56.600
Mr. Zhou

29
00:00:57.333 --> 00:00:58.466
Could you read it wrong?

30
00:00:58.466 --> 00:01:00.833
I have seen the ring of true love

31
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.200
Impossible to read wrong

32
00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:03.600
You believe now

33
00:01:05.533 --> 00:01:08.366
This must have been replaced by the real thing by the lady's dimming.

34
00:01:08.666 --> 00:01:09.800
So?

35
00:01:10.066 --> 00:01:13.200
No matter what I say, you have a reason to say it's false

36
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.500
Why should I waste my time with you here?

37
00:01:15.866 --> 00:01:16.833
President Liang

38
00:01:17.933 --> 00:01:19.200
Make a decision?
