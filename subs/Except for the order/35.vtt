00:00:00.966 --> 00:00:04.633
What time was I wrong? Please forgive me.

2
00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:12.066
Oh, how should I punish you?

3
00:00:14.533 --> 00:00:16.033
Don't break my mouth

4
00:00:16.966 --> 00:00:19.100
Sister, please say something

5
00:00:19.866 --> 00:00:22.300
What do you want for seven days?

6
00:00:22.333 --> 00:00:24.200
Don't make everyone want to stare at you

7
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.166
Kick him out

8
00:00:26.166 --> 00:00:27.666
Don't be too arrogant in the future

9
00:00:27.666 --> 00:00:28.466
Hey

10
00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:30.566
Hey let go of my brother

11
00:00:30.733 --> 00:00:33.566
Why did you kick my brother out for seven days?

12
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:35.166
Don't be too strong

13
00:00:35.166 --> 00:00:36.300
You think about it.

14
00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:38.966
How did you threaten me just now?

15
00:00:38.966 --> 00:00:40.300
Break my leg

16
00:00:40.366 --> 00:00:42.466
Then hang on to me

17
00:00:42.966 --> 00:00:45.566
He looked cocky.

18
00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.300
I just threw him out and ran

19
00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.000
Just say I'm a little fresh meat

20
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.133
What an internationally renowned

21
00:00:52.133 --> 00:00:54.500
Double label, don't make excuses

22
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:55.566
That's different.

23
00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:56.766
What's the difference?

24
00:00:56.766 --> 00:00:58.766
I just asked you for the amount.

25
00:00:58.866 --> 00:01:00.533
I also gave you a chance to apologize

26
00:01:00.533 --> 00:01:01.866
It's you who don't cherish it

27
00:01:01.866 --> 00:01:03.133
Intercede you said

28
00:01:03.133 --> 00:01:05.733
Just for these guys who look down on people

29
00:01:05.733 --> 00:01:06.333
Kneel?

30
00:01:06.333 --> 00:01:10.166
Don't you need to apologize for just barging in?

31
00:01:10.966 --> 00:01:13.033
What makes you think I barged in?

32
00:01:13.266 --> 00:01:14.366
The invitations are gone

33
00:01:14.366 --> 00:01:15.333
He said he wasn't used to it.

34
00:01:15.333 --> 00:01:19.100
How do you call for an invitation letter?

35
00:01:20.733 --> 00:01:22.033
Special invitation and invitation letter
