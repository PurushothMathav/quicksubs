1
00:00:00.566 --> 00:00:02.533
Haicheng Chamber of Commerce is a high-end nest

2
00:00:02.533 --> 00:00:03.733
Smuggled seafood

3
00:00:03.733 --> 00:00:05.166
Get over here and explain

4
00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:08.833
Where is poisonous seafood?

5
00:00:08.966 --> 00:00:11.233
This is obviously a simple pass.

6
00:00:11.533 --> 00:00:12.900
Complete quality products

7
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.966
Boy, are you calling to report?

8
00:00:17.966 --> 00:00:21.200
Don't you think it's really useful to report?

9
00:00:21.566 --> 00:00:23.966
It seems that you have done a lot of self-dealing before

10
00:00:24.066 --> 00:00:25.700
The crime of covering up the truth

11
00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:26.133
We

12
00:00:26.133 --> 00:00:29.566
What the experts of Haicheng Chamber of Commerce said is the truth

13
00:00:29.566 --> 00:00:32.166
As for what you said

14
00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.766
It's just a rumor

15
00:00:35.133 --> 00:00:37.166
How is it? There is no way

16
00:00:37.266 --> 00:00:40.433
My dad is rich and powerful and can do whatever he wants

17
00:00:40.866 --> 00:00:43.333
A small director of the Haicheng Chamber of Commerce

18
00:00:43.333 --> 00:00:44.933
Since you dare to do something

19
00:00:44.933 --> 00:00:47.066
You probably don't know how hard our backstage is.

20
00:00:47.366 --> 00:00:48.466
Then I'd like to hear it

21
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.500
What do you disagree with?

22
00:00:50.666 --> 00:00:52.300
It's okay to tell you

23
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.933
My backstage is Jiang Yonghui

24
00:00:54.933 --> 00:00:59.100
President Jiang Yonghui Jiang, Vice President of Haicheng Chamber of Commerce

25
00:00:59.466 --> 00:01:00.266
Excuse me.

26
00:01:00.566 --> 00:01:02.466
My name is Liang Youwei.

27
00:01:02.966 --> 00:01:04.400
It's Zhang Shengshi

28
00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:05.133
President Liang

29
00:01:05.133 --> 00:01:08.133
How could I be called by you?

30
00:01:08.133 --> 00:01:10.400
We'll know if he can come soon.

31
00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.600
When will it be resolved? You're done surrendering

32
00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:17.700
Can you fight?

33
00:01:17.933 --> 00:01:19.266
Can have a fart

34
00:01:19.333 --> 00:01:20.433
Passing through the interior

35
00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.300
The gun is fast and blocked within seven steps

36
00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:25.233
Possession of firearms

37
00:01:25.666 --> 00:01:26.566
Must be really big

38
00:01:26.966 --> 00:01:28.300
Dare to catch

39
00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.833
If you kneel down and beg for mercy now

40
00:01:30.966 --> 00:01:33.900
Maybe live a little longer. Stop it
