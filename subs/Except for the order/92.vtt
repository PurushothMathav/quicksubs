00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:01.866
I'll give you a minute.

2
00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:04.000
Leave your cigarettes

3
00:00:04.566 --> 00:00:05.866
How to do

4
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.166
I don't want to die yet.

5
00:00:07.166 --> 00:00:08.933
We all fought him together

6
00:00:08.933 --> 00:00:10.300
Fight

7
00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:13.700
We're all really dead, I don't want to die yet

8
00:00:14.066 --> 00:00:15.833
Can you be a dog for people?

9
00:00:16.066 --> 00:00:17.600
What slave hatred

10
00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.733
You were poisoned to beg?

11
00:00:19.733 --> 00:00:20.900
Impossible to ask for

12
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:24.800
today

13
00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:29.033
I used to laugh at you for being so mature

14
00:00:29.466 --> 00:00:32.266
He also said that there are actually a lot of good people

15
00:00:33.066 --> 00:00:34.266
Now it seems

16
00:00:34.733 --> 00:00:35.833
I was wrong.

17
00:00:36.266 --> 00:00:38.633
I'm sorry, you're almost done.

18
00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:40.866
I forgive you.

19
00:00:43.966 --> 00:00:46.166
If you are gentle, if there is no electricity for me

20
00:00:46.566 --> 00:00:48.366
Please kill me

21
00:00:48.766 --> 00:00:50.500
Let me die

22
00:00:50.766 --> 00:00:52.566
At least it's still clean

23
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:54.800
Don't worry.

24
00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.300
You don't die so easily

25
00:00:59.333 --> 00:01:01.866
You never believed in Qi Tian's strength

26
00:01:01.866 --> 00:01:04.166
I believe he will be able to protect us

27
00:01:04.466 --> 00:01:05.900
Nippon Fitness

28
00:01:06.266 --> 00:01:09.900
He should be showing his true strength now

29
00:01:10.166 --> 00:01:13.066
If Xiaobai moves in a while

30
00:01:13.533 --> 00:01:15.500
You protect them for me

31
00:01:16.933 --> 00:01:18.400
Buddha Sword God

32
00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:20.133
Since you are here

33
00:01:20.133 --> 00:01:21.700
Then stay

34
00:01:22.933 --> 00:01:23.733
master

35
00:01:24.333 --> 00:01:26.800
An opportunity to fix our country

36
00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.166
Great sorrow

37
00:01:30.466 --> 00:01:32.633
Dare to make waves in my sea city

38
00:01:32.666 --> 00:01:34.766
Look at you living people are tired of living
