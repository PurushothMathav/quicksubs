1
00:00:02.266 --> 00:00:04.633
This is the second option you mentioned.

2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.866
Well, of course not.

3
00:00:06.933 --> 00:00:09.433
We are competing against who catches more

4
00:00:09.666 --> 00:00:12.600
If I win, you will marry me

5
00:00:12.733 --> 00:00:14.100
It was agreed in advance

6
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:15.800
I'm good at fishing

7
00:00:16.166 --> 00:00:18.166
All right. Here we go.

8
00:00:24.266 --> 00:00:29.166
Mr. Ruan's transaction has been advanced to 8pm tonight

9
00:00:29.266 --> 00:00:30.400
See you at the pier

10
00:00:33.466 --> 00:00:37.000
Why trade in advance at the end of the year?

11
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.633
I need 10 million to sign a contract with Add

12
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.833
But it would be more feudal

13
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.333
Compared to newcomers who get added

14
00:00:46.333 --> 00:00:48.800
The danger is not worth mentioning

15
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.233
Add just hi-style used cars

16
00:00:51.366 --> 00:00:52.933
Why look risky?

17
00:00:52.933 --> 00:00:54.266
5 years

18
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.666
Added assets a hundredfold

19
00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:59.633
There must be someone big behind this

20
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:01.766
If you can buy him

21
00:01:02.066 --> 00:01:06.200
Our plan to weaken the Dragon Kingdom will go more smoothly

22
00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:07.866
I see

23
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.433
Thank you protagonist

24
00:01:21.466 --> 00:01:22.466
Miss Ye

25
00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.433
I'll check the results for you.

26
00:01:29.366 --> 00:01:32.066
So stingy, you don't want to marry me so much

27
00:01:32.066 --> 00:01:34.466
I don't know what's so great about your first love

28
00:01:37.966 --> 00:01:38.566
Mr. Qi

29
00:01:38.566 --> 00:01:40.566
The worker suddenly took the time to walk around seafood

30
00:01:40.566 --> 00:01:41.900
Advance to 8pm tonight

31
00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:43.900
We may be too late.
