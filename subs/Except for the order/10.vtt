00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.700
have money

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.700
Officials still have officials

3
00:00:04.466 --> 00:00:05.900
I urge you to add

4
00:00:06.166 --> 00:00:07.300
Do it yourself

5
00:00:07.966 --> 00:00:09.266
Chairperson Yang Chairperson Yang

6
00:00:09.266 --> 00:00:14.366
Ouch, my 10 million quota just didn't come up

7
00:00:16.966 --> 00:00:18.266
Yes, more than just lost the contract

8
00:00:18.266 --> 00:00:19.666
He also provoked President Liang

9
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.866
Good to go

10
00:00:23.066 --> 00:00:27.100
Go on a date and stop for me today

11
00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:29.866
Tell me if you are sincere

12
00:00:29.966 --> 00:00:32.000
land of wealth

13
00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:34.266
I can give you

14
00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.000
Naturally you can do whatever you want

15
00:00:36.766 --> 00:00:39.733
You only knew your father through Minister Liang

16
00:00:39.733 --> 00:00:41.166
This kind of Dafa

17
00:00:41.533 --> 00:00:43.366
Minister Liang can sell you a personal sticker.

18
00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.100
Can I sell you a second time?

19
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.300
Qi Tian, stop putting gold on your face

20
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.900
It seems that all the achievements of our Tian family are given by you.

21
00:00:52.266 --> 00:00:53.366
Right?

22
00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.466
Sister, don't worry.

23
00:01:01.333 --> 00:01:02.966
We must make them pay

24
00:01:03.133 --> 00:01:04.433
Miss Yuan

25
00:01:05.066 --> 00:01:09.233
We can also provide a 10 million purchase contract below.

26
00:01:09.466 --> 00:01:10.266
Oh, really?

27
00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.033
Your previous child was just a small tree.

28
00:01:15.066 --> 00:01:17.300
Pour first

29
00:01:27.133 --> 00:01:27.966
Don't turn

30
00:01:30.266 --> 00:01:32.400
Miss Yi, thank you for conducting for me

31
00:01:32.666 --> 00:01:33.900
But we are not suitable

32
00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:35.633
Then I'll give you two options.

33
00:01:35.733 --> 00:01:37.866
If you do either one

34
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.400
I won't pester you

35
00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:41.100
OK

36
00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.700
Option one, tell me who you really are.

37
00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.166
Can make the president of Haicheng Chamber of Commerce respect you

38
00:01:48.166 --> 00:01:50.833
Your true identity is definitely not simple

39
00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:52.400
This really doesn't work.

40
00:01:53.166 --> 00:01:53.966
that
