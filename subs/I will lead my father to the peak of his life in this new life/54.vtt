00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:02.100
Dad, I want that piece

2
00:00:02.733 --> 00:00:04.500
Xiaoyuer, do you want that stone?

3
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.900
I think that stone is so beautiful.

4
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:09.700
There must be something Aunt Li likes in it

5
00:00:09.866 --> 00:00:10.766
Little fish

6
00:00:11.333 --> 00:00:12.366
Is that the one?

7
00:00:12.366 --> 00:00:13.633
Yeah, OK.

8
00:00:13.966 --> 00:00:15.100
That's it.

9
00:00:15.466 --> 00:00:16.900
How much is this stone?

10
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.700
Rough Stone No. 09 3 million

11
00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:20.300
I want this piece from History Group.

12
00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.966
Liu Yang, I admit that you have some skills in business

13
00:00:23.966 --> 00:00:26.933
But jade is not for you to play with.

14
00:00:26.933 --> 00:00:28.166
What if I were you?

15
00:00:28.166 --> 00:00:29.566
I choose to shut up

16
00:00:29.566 --> 00:00:31.600
You have just offended Qi Shao

17
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.066
Now if you let Lee lose money again

18
00:00:34.066 --> 00:00:35.366
Lee always hates you

19
00:00:35.366 --> 00:00:38.266
You're going to die tonight.

20
00:00:38.266 --> 00:00:39.966
If you two can't talk

21
00:00:39.966 --> 00:00:41.366
Then I'll teach you.

22
00:00:41.366 --> 00:00:42.366
The county seat?

23
00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.800
How can you believe what a little kid says?

24
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.766
Ahahaha

25
00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:48.700
Girl doll

26
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:52.266
This jade is not as simple as you think.

27
00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:55.733
The old man has studied this road professionally for decades

28
00:00:55.733 --> 00:00:57.233
You're not sure

29
00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.566
Which rough stone has good material in it?

30
00:01:00.966 --> 00:01:03.000
A child plays

31
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.633
Can you still be serious?

32
00:01:04.866 --> 00:01:08.066
Dad, there must be a treasure in this stone

33
00:01:08.066 --> 00:01:09.466
I believe in little fish

34
00:01:09.666 --> 00:01:11.966
Is there any expectation in this stone?

35
00:01:12.166 --> 00:01:13.366
It's not up to you.

36
00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.566
You're a dog with a soft meal

37
00:01:16.566 --> 00:01:18.600
Dare to speak nonsense here

38
00:01:18.766 --> 00:01:20.933
Those who can come to the jade conference today

39
00:01:20.933 --> 00:01:22.200
None is not Jiangzhou

40
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.133
Even the top famous door of the entire building

41
00:01:25.133 --> 00:01:28.900
Even we dare not say whether a hunger strike is good or bad

42
00:01:29.266 --> 00:01:30.333
What right do you have?

43
00:01:30.333 --> 00:01:31.800
Young people

44
00:01:32.066 --> 00:01:33.266
I can understand.

45
00:01:33.266 --> 00:01:36.966
But don't overdo your best.

46
00:01:36.966 --> 00:01:38.933
Before you speak

47
00:01:38.933 --> 00:01:42.166
First look at your identity and status

48
00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.833
I, Lux Group, want this No. 09.
