00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:03.133
Dad, you can win 100 million in this lottery.

2
00:00:03.133 --> 00:00:04.700
You must give birth

3
00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:05.900
Don't be taken away

4
00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:08.966
Ok ok I will give birth well

5
00:00:08.966 --> 00:00:10.100
Today is your birthday

6
00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:11.566
Dad will take you to eat delicious food

7
00:00:11.566 --> 00:00:15.066
Let's have a meal, let's go

8
00:00:22.133 --> 00:00:24.633
Sir, what would you like to eat?

9
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:29.333
I'll tell you what.

10
00:00:29.333 --> 00:00:31.066
You don't have much time left.

11
00:00:31.066 --> 00:00:32.966
Get your daughter back quickly

12
00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:43.600
How blind

13
00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.533
It's all on Lao Tzu's clothes

14
00:00:45.533 --> 00:00:47.300
Dr. Xiaojuan

15
00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:48.866
How did that happen?

16
00:00:48.866 --> 00:00:50.366
Why are you trash again?

17
00:00:51.466 --> 00:00:52.466
I'm so damn unlucky

18
00:00:52.466 --> 00:00:54.100
I can meet you anywhere

19
00:00:54.733 --> 00:00:55.533
Xie Tiancheng

20
00:00:56.266 --> 00:00:58.400
Liu Sisi Song Yang

21
00:00:58.533 --> 00:01:00.366
What are you, a migrant worker, doing here?

22
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.233
Hey, my daughter came over for dinner.

23
00:01:03.466 --> 00:01:04.400
What's the problem?

24
00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:05.733
Of course there is a problem.

25
00:01:05.733 --> 00:01:07.966
You are a piece of trash, you deserve this

26
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:09.866
But it's okay.

27
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.100
Now that you're here

28
00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.333
Save me from looking for you

29
00:01:12.333 --> 00:01:13.700
Give me back my daughter

30
00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.000
This vicious woman

31
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.966
Back then, it was for Ye Tiancheng's daughter

32
00:01:17.966 --> 00:01:19.266
To poke my bone marrow

33
00:01:19.366 --> 00:01:21.166
How could I be like you?

34
00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:22.100
selfish

35
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.766
I told you you wanted my daughter. No way

36
00:01:24.766 --> 00:01:26.800
What's more, you almost killed him before

37
00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.800
Dad, let's go cash the lottery ticket

38
00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:32.766
They don't dare to do this after cashing the lottery ticket. Stop

39
00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:35.666
You dog

40
00:01:35.666 --> 00:01:38.000
I still want to find the clothes that got my brain dirty.

41
00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:39.866
Leave your daughter behind
