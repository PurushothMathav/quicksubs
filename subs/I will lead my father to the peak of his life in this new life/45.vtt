00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:01.800
Hahaha kid

2
00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.600
Cloud Pavilion, I might as well tell you

3
00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:05.866
Throughout Jiangzhou

4
00:00:05.866 --> 00:00:08.600
Only the Li family can afford Yunshang Pavilion

5
00:00:08.666 --> 00:00:10.566
I don't know if other people can afford it.

6
00:00:10.566 --> 00:00:12.200
I can't afford it anyway

7
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:13.400
Go for it.

8
00:00:13.933 --> 00:00:15.200
History Gold Card

9
00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.433
You know of course

10
00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.700
The History Gold Card is a status symbol of history

11
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:23.100
Only the children of the Li family can have it

12
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.800
However, I am also quite familiar with the Li family

13
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.966
Why didn't I see sloppy?

14
00:00:28.166 --> 00:00:31.600
Qi Shao, he shouldn't be pretending to be someone who left home, right?

15
00:00:31.666 --> 00:00:33.500
Impersonating a child of history

16
00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.366
Do you know what the consequences are?

17
00:00:35.366 --> 00:00:38.466
My card was given to me by Li Lao himself

18
00:00:39.533 --> 00:00:42.900
You said that Grandpa Li gave you a gold card.

19
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:46.333
Why don't you say that Li Qingcheng is your girlfriend?

20
00:00:46.333 --> 00:00:48.466
Well, you were right.

21
00:00:48.466 --> 00:00:49.666
She really is

22
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.400
Forget it, I'm too lazy to waste time with you.

23
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.233
I'll give Allure a call

24
00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.200
Hello police, are you busy?

25
00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.566
My real estate company under your company

26
00:00:59.566 --> 00:01:02.966
Something happened, I almost got caught by him

27
00:01:02.966 --> 00:01:05.466
Okay, Qi Shao, don't waste your time here

28
00:01:05.466 --> 00:01:06.766
You go upstairs and wait for me

29
00:01:06.766 --> 00:01:08.900
OK, I'll wait for you.

30
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.600
Where did you pick up a broken card to show off your power here?

31
00:01:14.066 --> 00:01:15.633
So poor and pretending

32
00:01:17.866 --> 00:01:19.100
Gold and silver relief

33
00:01:19.666 --> 00:01:21.866
This is Mr. Li's personal customized card.
