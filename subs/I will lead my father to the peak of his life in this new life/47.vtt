00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.266
What? How?

2
00:00:04.566 --> 00:00:06.933
Manager Zhou, I said it

3
00:00:06.933 --> 00:00:10.633
He's just a grandstanding clown

4
00:00:10.866 --> 00:00:13.666
Hurry up and let someone throw him out.

5
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.066
Brush again.

6
00:00:15.533 --> 00:00:17.066
Fake is fake

7
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.666
What if you brush it again?

8
00:00:18.666 --> 00:00:21.266
I see, the people from the Li Group will come later.

9
00:00:21.266 --> 00:00:23.066
Why are you on your knees begging for mercy?

10
00:00:23.733 --> 00:00:24.566
Manager Zhou

11
00:00:24.566 --> 00:00:26.700
You don't really want to hear this kid

12
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:28.000
Brush it again.

13
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.866
Maybe something went wrong.

14
00:00:29.866 --> 00:00:31.366
The stakes are high.

15
00:00:31.366 --> 00:00:32.366
Don't be hasty

16
00:00:32.766 --> 00:00:34.266
Let's brush it again.

17
00:00:35.066 --> 00:00:37.300
Haha Manager Zhou

18
00:00:38.733 --> 00:00:40.566
Why don't you brush it again?

19
00:00:40.566 --> 00:00:43.366
Maybe it's really your poison card that's pissed off

20
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:44.366
No, nothing else.

21
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.133
This card is fake

22
00:00:46.133 --> 00:00:47.000
Explain

23
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.600
I can guarantee that this card is absolutely fine.

24
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.100
So what do you mean?

25
00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:53.366
There is a problem with our card reader.

26
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.400
It may also be that your frontline is not enough

27
00:00:55.466 --> 00:00:57.266
Absolutely no problem with the card reader.

28
00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.200
As for the authority you mentioned

29
00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.000
I am the manager of the sales department.

30
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.100
There is no card that I cannot verify.

31
00:01:03.166 --> 00:01:05.200
Manager Zhou, are you so sure?

32
00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:06.233
This gentleman

33
00:01:06.266 --> 00:01:08.466
Since you can't give a reasonable explanation

34
00:01:08.466 --> 00:01:10.966
Then please cooperate with me

35
00:01:10.966 --> 00:01:12.600
Somebody take him down

36
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.166
I see who dares

37
00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:23.100
This is Li's Group Asphalt City D President
