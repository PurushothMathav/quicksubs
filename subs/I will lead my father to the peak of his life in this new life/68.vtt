1
00:00:02.166 --> 00:00:03.366
Really bold

2
00:00:03.366 --> 00:00:04.566
First time in Jingzhou

3
00:00:04.566 --> 00:00:07.666
I didn't even encounter the trouble of cursing me to be killed

4
00:00:08.066 --> 00:00:08.800
Mr. Wu

5
00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:11.200
I think what they said is not completely unreasonable

6
00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:12.033
What!

7
00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:14.233
And you think they're right.

8
00:00:14.366 --> 00:00:16.866
Mr. Gu Jiangzhou, this is your first time here.

9
00:00:16.866 --> 00:00:18.400
You are indeed upright

10
00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.166
But also because you are upright

11
00:00:20.166 --> 00:00:22.633
So there are many people who don't like you.

12
00:00:22.666 --> 00:00:24.100
Even so

13
00:00:24.666 --> 00:00:26.533
I still have you with someone to protect me

14
00:00:26.533 --> 00:00:29.366
He didn't need a child to remind him.

15
00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.266
They are locals after all

16
00:00:31.566 --> 00:00:32.766
The one named Song Yang

17
00:00:32.766 --> 00:00:34.900
Can come up with a plan that makes your eyes shine

18
00:00:35.066 --> 00:00:36.933
Explain that it is by no means a tomb

19
00:00:36.933 --> 00:00:39.266
Maybe I really heard something

20
00:00:39.666 --> 00:00:40.766
During this time

21
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.300
You all worked hard

22
00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.100
Mr. Gu

23
00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.666
This kind of thing is better believed than not believed

24
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.700
You'd better put on your stab suit.

25
00:00:50.133 --> 00:00:52.666
Even you don't have the confidence to protect me?

26
00:00:52.666 --> 00:00:55.666
Mr. Gu is not afraid of ten thousand, but afraid of one
