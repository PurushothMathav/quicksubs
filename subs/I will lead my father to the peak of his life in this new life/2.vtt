00:00:00.666 --> 00:00:01.733
Hurry up

2
00:00:01.733 --> 00:00:02.933
Hurry up for me

3
00:00:02.933 --> 00:00:04.000
Delayed the attack

4
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.100
I don't want to mention a penny

5
00:00:06.066 --> 00:00:08.300
I can't carry it and come to the construction site to work hard

6
00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:09.700
Lao Tzu is out of money

7
00:00:10.466 --> 00:00:12.533
I don't know what that means.

8
00:00:12.533 --> 00:00:14.333
Moving cement at the construction site

9
00:00:14.333 --> 00:00:16.633
He also sent his daughter to a noble school

10
00:00:18.066 --> 00:00:19.666
Hey, isn't this Song Yang?

11
00:00:19.666 --> 00:00:21.166
Why are you still moving cement here?

12
00:00:21.166 --> 00:00:23.800
You, your ex-wife with the title

13
00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.533
Went to school to rob your daughter

14
00:00:25.533 --> 00:00:26.666
You fool!

15
00:00:26.666 --> 00:00:28.266
Hahahaha

16
00:00:29.866 --> 00:00:30.533
Little fish

17
00:00:30.533 --> 00:00:32.266
Did you have a good class at school today?

18
00:00:32.266 --> 00:00:34.400
You are so nice

19
00:00:34.533 --> 00:00:35.333
come

20
00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:37.800
This is what mom sold you.

21
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:39.566
have children

22
00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:43.833
Put your daughter down

23
00:00:45.866 --> 00:00:46.833
Dad?

24
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.200
Song Yao, you came just in time

25
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.833
From today onwards, he belongs to my mother

26
00:00:53.066 --> 00:00:55.300
Nonsense he's my daughter

27
00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.400
Do you deserve your daughter?

28
00:00:57.666 --> 00:00:58.933
You are a migrant worker who moves bricks on a construction site

29
00:00:58.933 --> 00:01:00.300
How much money can you make?

30
00:01:00.533 --> 00:01:02.700
I live like a dog

31
00:01:02.966 --> 00:01:05.533
Even if you send him to this noble school

32
00:01:05.533 --> 00:01:07.433
Isn't he still the daughter of migrant workers?

33
00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:10.566
Ask him if he is willing to live a hard life with you.

34
00:01:10.566 --> 00:01:12.600
Are you still willing to enjoy glory and wealth with me?

35
00:01:15.333 --> 00:01:18.366
Mom, don't say that, dad

36
00:01:19.733 --> 00:01:21.566
What choice is there?

37
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.300
Of course it's fun with us

38
00:01:30.666 --> 00:01:33.233
Even if you sell your blood and fight for my life

39
00:01:33.333 --> 00:01:35.366
I want my daughter to go to a better school.

40
00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.900
It doesn't matter if I live like a dog

41
00:01:38.333 --> 00:01:40.233
My daughter will be well-fed

42
00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:43.600
Life

43
00:01:44.266 --> 00:01:46.933
How much is your life worth?

44
00:01:46.933 --> 00:01:48.666
It's not that I look down on you

45
00:01:48.666 --> 00:01:50.533
Even if you work hard all your life

46
00:01:50.533 --> 00:01:53.000
Can't compare to Lao Tzu's finger

47
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.033
Today, open your dog eyes and see clearly.

48
00:01:57.266 --> 00:02:01.600
From now on, I will be his father

49
00:02:03.466 --> 00:02:05.400
Go to hell

50
00:02:26.166 --> 00:02:28.866
Dad, don't hit my dad

51
00:02:28.866 --> 00:02:30.633
Don't hit my dad

52
00:02:37.533 --> 00:02:38.333
Little fish
