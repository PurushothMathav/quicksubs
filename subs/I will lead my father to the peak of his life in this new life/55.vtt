00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:03.600
History Group bid 3 million have a higher price?

2
00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:05.966
3 million time

3
00:00:06.333 --> 00:00:07.666
3 million twice

4
00:00:07.966 --> 00:00:09.300
3 million three times

5
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:11.400
Congratulations on the deal, Mr. Li

6
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:16.300
Honey, do you really believe him?

7
00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:18.933
This rough stone should be able to make jade

8
00:00:18.933 --> 00:00:21.800
I pour out the three words Qi Guangjin, newcomer

9
00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.100
Then you wait.

10
00:00:23.466 --> 00:00:24.800
Name upside down

11
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.500
Don't be too arrogant young people

12
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:31.700
I'm sure this rough stone is absolute scrap.

13
00:00:31.866 --> 00:00:35.666
Song Yang Wang Lao is a leading jade expert

14
00:00:35.666 --> 00:00:37.766
Is it possible that no child knows much?

15
00:00:37.766 --> 00:00:41.266
Even if you want to curry favor and leave, there is no one like you.

16
00:00:41.266 --> 00:00:42.666
How big is your face now?

17
00:00:42.666 --> 00:00:44.100
I'll lose face later

18
00:00:44.133 --> 00:00:46.766
Boy, if you're so sure

19
00:00:46.766 --> 00:00:48.933
This stone can produce good material

20
00:00:48.933 --> 00:00:51.300
Then do you dare to gamble with this young master?

21
00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.400
What do you want to bet on?

22
00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.766
If jade comes out of this stone

23
00:00:54.766 --> 00:00:56.466
I'll give you 10 million

24
00:00:56.533 --> 00:00:58.100
If it can't be opened

25
00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.900
You kneel in front of me and call me grandpa three times

26
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.200
Then get out of Jiangzhou

27
00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:06.533
My dad won't lose to you, a big bad guy

28
00:01:06.533 --> 00:01:09.533
Little brat, your father never taught you to speak as an adult

29
00:01:09.533 --> 00:01:10.733
Don't you interrupt, kid?

30
00:01:10.733 --> 00:01:12.633
Laser sword you say me

31
00:01:13.166 --> 00:01:15.000
Dare to say a little fish again

32
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.266
I'll keep you from getting out of here intact
