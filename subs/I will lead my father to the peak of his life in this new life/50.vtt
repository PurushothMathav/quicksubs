1
00:00:00.866 --> 00:00:03.433
The Qi family doesn't take my Li family seriously

2
00:00:03.466 --> 00:00:05.666
How dare you attack my Li family's son-in-law

3
00:00:06.066 --> 00:00:06.900
Allure!

4
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:09.200
You and Xiao Song go out for a while

5
00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:10.700
Dad, what did you say?

6
00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:12.633
Hu Shaofei, the richest man in the building

7
00:00:12.733 --> 00:00:14.733
It will come to Jiangzhou next week.

8
00:00:14.733 --> 00:00:18.033
Qi Guangjin has known him for a long time in the imperial capital

9
00:00:18.133 --> 00:00:20.866
I'm afraid Dad Gu Shaofei is the richest man in the building

10
00:00:20.866 --> 00:00:23.466
It is impossible to embarrass our history group for no reason

11
00:00:23.466 --> 00:00:26.500
Gu Shaofei naturally would not do such a tasteless thing

12
00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.133
Time wisdom

13
00:00:28.133 --> 00:00:29.300
Once next week

14
00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:30.666
He was at the greeting.

15
00:00:30.666 --> 00:00:32.700
Win the cooperation with the Gu family in the imperial capital

16
00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.700
He will definitely marry you by force

17
00:00:34.733 --> 00:00:37.133
Dad, I don't trust Qi Guangji's stubborn son

18
00:00:37.133 --> 00:00:38.666
Will be invaded by the Gu family

19
00:00:38.933 --> 00:00:40.666
Lu Shaofei loves the imperial history

20
00:00:40.666 --> 00:00:43.466
And the Qi family happened to be in the royal business

21
00:00:43.566 --> 00:00:45.066
Just do what you want

22
00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:47.066
It's easy to win cooperation.

23
00:00:47.166 --> 00:00:48.966
Exactly three more days.

24
00:00:48.966 --> 00:00:50.466
Southern Jade Association

25
00:00:50.466 --> 00:00:53.566
A master conference will be held in Jiangzhou

26
00:00:53.566 --> 00:00:55.766
The washing machine will definitely go by then.

27
00:00:55.766 --> 00:00:57.033
By that time

28
00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.700
It's troublesome

29
00:00:58.966 --> 00:01:00.500
Jade Conference

30
00:01:00.566 --> 00:01:03.433
The best piece of the world at this conference

31
00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.600
I still remember what that rough stone looked like

32
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.266
Grandpa Li's father can help history get through this difficult time

33
00:01:09.533 --> 00:01:12.033
What did the little fish say?

34
00:01:12.266 --> 00:01:14.766
Dad, don't you know jade too?

35
00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:16.866
Xiao Song, do you still know jade?

36
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.600
When I was in college

37
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.700
There was a jade appreciation class.

38
00:01:20.933 --> 00:01:23.466
Shake some fur and get a certificate

39
00:01:23.566 --> 00:01:25.366
Just a little understanding?

40
00:01:25.366 --> 00:01:27.166
Take the little fish with you then.

41
00:01:27.166 --> 00:01:28.333
The first few key moments

42
00:01:28.333 --> 00:01:29.700
It was the little fish who prompted me.

43
00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.000
Maybe the little fish will really bring me good luck

44
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.100
Anyway.

45
00:01:33.166 --> 00:01:34.566
It's not in my character to sit still

46
00:01:34.566 --> 00:01:36.400
Uncle Li, I want to try it.

47
00:01:36.733 --> 00:01:38.566
So ambitious

48
00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.900
Like you said, we can't just sit back and wait

49
00:01:40.966 --> 00:01:43.966
So all the expenses at the jade conference

50
00:01:43.966 --> 00:01:46.200
All are the sole responsibility of the History Group

51
00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.900
You let go
