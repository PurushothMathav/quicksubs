1
00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:02.766
I can also praise him for being a good dog

2
00:00:02.766 --> 00:00:04.466
A bunch of ignorant stubbornness

3
00:00:04.933 --> 00:00:07.166
Song Yang, don't be strong, okay?

4
00:00:07.166 --> 00:00:08.866
Everyone here today

5
00:00:08.866 --> 00:00:11.266
Which is not the top talent in Jiangsu?

6
00:00:11.266 --> 00:00:12.500
Young hero

7
00:00:13.066 --> 00:00:14.000
ordinary person

8
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.266
I'm not even qualified to see this door

9
00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:17.600
What are you?

10
00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.400
Dare to say we are playing cool

11
00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.866
The nouveau riche mentality of the poor

12
00:00:21.866 --> 00:00:24.333
Never seen the scenery of the upper class

13
00:00:24.333 --> 00:00:25.866
I thought I was a bit talented

14
00:00:25.866 --> 00:00:27.500
Can it be comparable to us?

15
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.400
You are not allowed to talk about my father

16
00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.966
My dad was better than all of you

17
00:00:31.966 --> 00:00:33.233
Ouch Sun Yang

18
00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.100
Although you are not good in other aspects

19
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.866
But I have to say you have a great daughter too

20
00:00:38.166 --> 00:00:39.766
Let's take a look.

21
00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.966
How much this little brat trusts his crap dad

22
00:00:45.133 --> 00:00:47.100
Hey my eyes

23
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.000
My ability

24
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.500
It's not that you stubborn kids can understand

25
00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:51.733
You just have to remember

26
00:00:51.733 --> 00:00:53.966
You will be shocked by what you said today

27
00:00:54.133 --> 00:00:55.066
Dare hoho

28
00:00:55.333 --> 00:00:57.066
Song Yang is enough

29
00:00:57.066 --> 00:00:58.666
It goes on forever, right?

30
00:00:58.666 --> 00:00:59.266
If it weren't for Li

31
00:00:59.266 --> 00:01:01.366
I will always come forward to help you get back the 100 million.

32
00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.733
My husband has long since abolished my hands and feet

33
00:01:03.733 --> 00:01:04.766
When a beggar goes

34
00:01:04.866 --> 00:01:06.500
One is only a little bit relying on the Li family

35
00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:07.933
Waste of micro-ink ability

36
00:01:07.933 --> 00:01:09.133
Do you still want to turn the sky upside down?

37
00:01:09.133 --> 00:01:11.500
I really think the Li family can protect you for the rest of your life, Mr. Li

38
00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.000
He just sees you as pitiful

39
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.266
You do have a little help for Mr. Li

40
00:01:15.266 --> 00:01:16.900
He's willing to give you a hand

41
00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:19.566
If you continue to be so ignorant

42
00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.333
I don't need you someday

43
00:01:21.333 --> 00:01:22.666
No place to cry

44
00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.533
Okay, stop talking nonsense with him

45
00:01:24.533 --> 00:01:26.900
If you are not a member of the Chamber of Commerce, you dare to enter the venue

46
00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:28.166
I'm going to break your leg now.

47
00:01:28.166 --> 00:01:29.500
No one dared to say anything

48
00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:30.633
I advise you.

49
00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.333
If you are sensible, get out by yourself

50
00:01:32.333 --> 00:01:34.300
Don't make me ask someone to throw you out

51
00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:35.866
And I'm here today.

52
00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.066
So what if you don't go?

53
00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:40.133
Then don't blame me

54
00:01:40.133 --> 00:01:41.033
Come

55
00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.766
Throw him out of here and you can't disturb dad

56
00:01:44.766 --> 00:01:46.266
My dad is thrifty

57
00:01:47.466 --> 00:01:50.700
Diligent Dad, take out Diligent

58
00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.900
Husband, is this Sister Qin real?

59
00:01:59.333 --> 00:02:00.633
Money is real

60
00:02:02.266 --> 00:02:03.800
Where did you come from, Sister Qin?
