1
00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.600
Don't regret it in the end.

2
00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:03.966
Regret what do I regret

3
00:00:03.966 --> 00:00:06.066
Did you see it, Song Yang?

4
00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:07.300
You rubbish

5
00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:08.300
After using the money

6
00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:10.800
It still doesn't change the nature of your inferiority

7
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.300
And your lowly daughter

8
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:13.966
You can only be inferior

9
00:00:14.266 --> 00:00:15.600
I don't know the sky is high and the earth is thick

10
00:00:15.733 --> 00:00:18.366
Do you really think you will rise to the top by putting Li's house on it?

11
00:00:18.366 --> 00:00:19.333
How ridiculous!

12
00:00:19.333 --> 00:00:21.733
You just picked up a little scrap of the Li family

13
00:00:21.733 --> 00:00:22.766
Leftovers

14
00:00:22.766 --> 00:00:24.666
I really think of myself as a character

15
00:00:24.666 --> 00:00:26.500
Hey, Song Yang, are you now?

16
00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:27.366
Kneel down for me

17
00:00:27.366 --> 00:00:30.100
Give me three more sincere kowtows

18
00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:33.133
Maybe I can go and talk to Principal Chen

19
00:00:33.133 --> 00:00:34.433
Lighter punishment

20
00:00:34.533 --> 00:00:38.500
Don't think you will all regret it hahaha

21
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:39.400
regret

22
00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:42.266
Mr. Song, you are taking yourself too seriously

23
00:00:42.266 --> 00:00:45.133
Do you know my identity and background?

24
00:00:45.133 --> 00:00:46.466
I'm afraid you don't know

25
00:00:46.466 --> 00:00:48.066
Principal Chen's brother

26
00:00:48.066 --> 00:00:50.700
He is the president of the largest car company in Jiangzhou

27
00:00:50.966 --> 00:00:52.333
Wen Wencheng Mr. Chen

28
00:00:52.333 --> 00:00:54.966
That's why even Li Lao has to give three countries

29
00:00:54.966 --> 00:00:55.733
Face person?

30
00:00:55.733 --> 00:00:58.766
It's just you, a waste who eats a soft meal

31
00:00:58.933 --> 00:01:01.466
How can you beat Principal Chen to Principal Chen?

32
00:01:01.466 --> 00:01:03.866
I think Song Yang doesn't seem to be convinced

33
00:01:03.866 --> 00:01:06.066
Why don't you cut you off?

34
00:01:06.066 --> 00:01:07.700
Okay. How about today?

35
00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.000
To make you feel what despair is

36
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.200
I will be kind enough to let you meet my brother today

37
00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:14.300
Wait until after you

38
00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.300
What unrealistic hopes are there?

39
00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:17.700
Well, my brother will be here soon.

40
00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:18.566
You wait for me.

41
00:01:18.566 --> 00:01:20.266
Wait just wait hey

42
00:01:20.266 --> 00:01:21.766
You belong to you
