00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:02.866
Why is the leaf less sour?

2
00:00:03.066 --> 00:00:05.766
I will sour you jokes

3
00:00:05.766 --> 00:00:07.500
I just want to sigh

4
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.800
Mr. Bi's money is probably going to be wasted

5
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.400
What do you mean by that?

6
00:00:12.566 --> 00:00:13.700
Look at North America

7
00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:15.800
Marc, the richest man, is developing new energy vehicles

8
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.233
You just follow along

9
00:00:17.266 --> 00:00:19.333
Don't you see how considerate Marc is?

10
00:00:19.333 --> 00:00:20.700
What are you?

11
00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.100
He did his

12
00:00:22.266 --> 00:00:23.200
I do mine.

13
00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:24.300
I don't care what he does

14
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.533
The automotive industry has always been dominated by the West

15
00:00:27.533 --> 00:00:30.033
People have enough capital to run over

16
00:00:30.166 --> 00:00:31.533
You haven't started yet.

17
00:00:31.533 --> 00:00:34.066
People's cars have already flooded into the building market

18
00:00:34.066 --> 00:00:37.200
The car you built with all your money gone bankrupt

19
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.800
Can only be planted in the hands

20
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.333
Even you want to shake

21
00:00:40.333 --> 00:00:42.200
The position of Westerners in the automotive industry

22
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.933
Marc moved his finger

23
00:00:44.933 --> 00:00:47.466
It will let you die without losing your life

24
00:00:47.466 --> 00:00:49.100
All of you here today

25
00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.133
They are all top talents in Jiangzhou

26
00:00:51.133 --> 00:00:52.533
Let me ask you something.

27
00:00:52.533 --> 00:00:54.566
How many buildings have you bought?

28
00:00:54.566 --> 00:00:56.766
How many Western cars are there?

29
00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.166
Take myself as an example.

30
00:00:58.166 --> 00:01:00.966
The biggest business for us industrialists is automobiles.

31
00:01:00.966 --> 00:01:03.600
Western brands such as BMW and Benz

32
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.500
I have a bunch in my garage

33
00:01:05.666 --> 00:01:08.100
But my family just doesn't have a car in a building

34
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.166
Why is that?

35
00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:12.666
It's because the cars in the building are not as good as the cars in the West

36
00:01:12.666 --> 00:01:13.766
worship foreign and foreign

37
00:01:13.766 --> 00:01:15.966
What's wrong with me driving a domestic car?

38
00:01:15.966 --> 00:01:17.766
You're talking about your car.

39
00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.466
Little eMule

40
00:01:19.666 --> 00:01:21.266
Haha you inferior

41
00:01:21.266 --> 00:01:23.766
What qualifications do you have to play the car with us?

42
00:01:23.766 --> 00:01:26.000
You can ask about our upper class

43
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.400
Which person went out in a car that was not a Western luxury car?

44
00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:29.400
So what?

45
00:01:29.666 --> 00:01:31.000
As long as I try to catch up

46
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:31.900
One day

47
00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:34.700
Our domestic cars will definitely surpass their western cars.

48
00:01:34.966 --> 00:01:37.466
Tang Bidangche's skin sweats

49
00:01:37.766 --> 00:01:39.766
Song Yang, I know you have ambition

50
00:01:39.766 --> 00:01:41.166
But you have to stutter.

51
00:01:41.166 --> 00:01:42.300
The road has to be walked step by step

52
00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:44.466
It's not good to be too high and not too far away

53
00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.200
Aunt Li, you must trust Dad

54
00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.200
Dad will definitely succeed

55
00:01:50.366 --> 00:01:53.833
So Song Yang, you are still

56
00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:57.366
What kind of car is that?

57
00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.366
Let's go out and take a look
