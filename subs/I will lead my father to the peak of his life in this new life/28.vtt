00:00:01.066 --> 00:00:02.866
Ah yes, you must have stolen it.

2
00:00:02.866 --> 00:00:03.866
You are a waste

3
00:00:03.866 --> 00:00:05.800
How can I get such a level of invitation?

4
00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:09.200
This is not 10 invitations that are only sent out 3 times a year

5
00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.000
The materials and labor alone are worth millions

6
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.500
How could it be like you?

7
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.533
There are only 100 million waste in the hands of the whole body

8
00:00:16.533 --> 00:00:19.133
To have such a thrifty person is the supreme status

9
00:00:19.133 --> 00:00:20.400
Can be a family heirloom

10
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:21.633
You must have stolen it

11
00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:22.533
What nonsense

12
00:00:22.533 --> 00:00:23.733
This is mine.

13
00:00:23.733 --> 00:00:25.266
This is a non-real-name relative.

14
00:00:25.266 --> 00:00:26.566
Your name is not written on it

15
00:00:26.566 --> 00:00:28.000
How do you prove that he is yours?

16
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.800
This was given to Dad by Aunt Li herself

17
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.533
Li always gave it to him by hand

18
00:00:32.533 --> 00:00:34.333
Humph him

19
00:00:34.333 --> 00:00:36.666
How can you let Mr. Li give it away by herself?

20
00:00:36.666 --> 00:00:38.800
Trash that even I don't like

21
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.400
What's more, Li is always such a beautiful girl

22
00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.100
I can't hook it.

23
00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:45.600
Press back and die slowly

24
00:00:47.966 --> 00:00:49.666
I'll see who dares to touch him

25
00:00:58.466 --> 00:01:00.366
I'll see who dares to move and let go

26
00:01:00.366 --> 00:01:01.466
Hey aunt

27
00:01:02.133 --> 00:01:03.166
Little fish

28
00:01:03.166 --> 00:01:05.966
Xiao Song, some things in the company have been delayed.

29
00:01:05.966 --> 00:01:08.033
Let you suffer for a long time here

30
00:01:08.133 --> 00:01:09.733
I'm really sorry.

31
00:01:09.733 --> 00:01:10.966
Mi Lao

32
00:01:11.133 --> 00:01:12.600
What are you talking about?

33
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.000
It's my pleasure that you can come out and say a word for me.

34
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.366
How could I blame you?

35
00:01:17.333 --> 00:01:20.733
Ye Tiancheng, are you a little too presumptuous?

36
00:01:20.733 --> 00:01:23.200
So arrogant in the banquet hall I set up

37
00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.566
This clearly doesn't take me all over the world in your eyes.

38
00:01:26.566 --> 00:01:27.533
No no no no

39
00:01:27.533 --> 00:01:30.366
Mr. Li, I suspect that I stole someone else's intelligence check

40
00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.933
So now the old man is here

41
00:01:32.933 --> 00:01:34.933
Do you understand?

42
00:01:34.933 --> 00:01:36.266
Uh, checked it out

43
00:01:36.266 --> 00:01:37.833
I'll return the letter to him now

44
00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.433
How is Mr. Song's company now?

45
00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.200
The company is operating normally

46
00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.033
The test car has reached the testing stage

47
00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.533
That's good until the company is profitable

48
00:01:52.533 --> 00:01:54.266
Don't forget me as a shareholder

49
00:01:54.266 --> 00:01:55.633
How could I forget?

50
00:01:55.733 --> 00:01:57.300
No Li Lao and Miss Li

51
00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:58.200
There is no me Song Yang

52
00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.266
Today, I am Song Yang grateful picture report

53
00:02:00.266 --> 00:02:02.100
Waiting for the experimental car

54
00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:03.500
Song Yang

55
00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.900
Are you going to develop new energy vehicles?
