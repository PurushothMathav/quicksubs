00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:01.866
Old man, my name is Li Sihai

2
00:00:01.966 --> 00:00:04.266
How are you going to kill me?

3
00:00:04.666 --> 00:00:07.466
Li Sihai is also my father's name

4
00:00:07.466 --> 00:00:08.633
Can you call out

5
00:00:08.933 --> 00:00:10.166
I will never be Tarzan

6
00:00:10.166 --> 00:00:11.166
I will never be Tarzan

7
00:00:11.166 --> 00:00:12.100
It's all a misunderstanding

8
00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:13.000
I don't know.

9
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.633
I didn't know you knew this loser

10
00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:17.000
I didn't know you knew Brother Song

11
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.200
It's all a misunderstanding, it's all a misunderstanding

12
00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.266
Misunderstandings can pick anyone to guard against rape

13
00:00:20.266 --> 00:00:21.200
Please listen to me explain

14
00:00:21.366 --> 00:00:22.000
Let me explain.

15
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.166
bully

16
00:00:23.166 --> 00:00:26.066
How dare you pick people to keep gold in broad daylight

17
00:00:26.066 --> 00:00:28.433
I think it's darker than the underworld

18
00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:31.600
There is no need for the Ye family to exist anymore

19
00:00:32.933 --> 00:00:33.733
fuck

20
00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:34.900
sweep satellite

21
00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:37.066
Why didn't you tell me he knew Lee Senhai?

22
00:00:37.133 --> 00:00:38.100
That's not possible.

23
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.233
That's not going to happen.

24
00:00:39.333 --> 00:00:40.766
Doctor, listen to me

25
00:00:40.766 --> 00:00:42.100
This waste before this

26
00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:43.866
I know everyone I know

27
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.200
How could he possibly know the richest man in Jiangcheng?

28
00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.000
These two must be the actors they're looking for

29
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.566
Absolutely it must be fake

30
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.266
Are you sure doctor I'm sure

31
00:00:56.333 --> 00:00:58.100
I'm sure before that

32
00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:59.566
He has access to the richest people

33
00:00:59.566 --> 00:01:01.300
It's just a contractor

34
00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.300
How could he be the richest person born?

35
00:01:06.566 --> 00:01:10.100
Okay, the calf was almost deceived by you

36
00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:11.400
Dare to pretend to be Mr. Li

37
00:01:11.566 --> 00:01:13.966
I think you should disappear from this world

38
00:01:13.966 --> 00:01:17.100
You'll know who we are right away

39
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.600
Stinky bitch, you're still pretending to be that wild boy here

40
00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:20.766
Don't listen to him

41
00:01:21.166 --> 00:01:23.633
Send someone to capture him and send him to history

42
00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.700
At that time, the president will definitely reward us.

43
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.266
You grab

44
00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:31.066
Come on.

45
00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:32.800
What!
