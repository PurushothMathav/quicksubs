1
00:00:01.866 --> 00:00:03.200
That's not possible.

2
00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.700
Brushing your teeth, did you hear that?

3
00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:09.800
Mr. Li has abandoned you

4
00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:11.166
What else are you fighting with me?

5
00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:12.500
Mr. Song

6
00:00:12.566 --> 00:00:15.266
I plan to invest in this company with you

7
00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.466
How about giving me some shares?

8
00:00:17.466 --> 00:00:20.400
Miss Li, what's wrong with you?

9
00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.366
Don't you want to cooperate with me?

10
00:00:22.366 --> 00:00:24.233
No, no, that's not what it means.

11
00:00:24.533 --> 00:00:27.900
It's just that you said before that this company

12
00:00:28.766 --> 00:00:29.933
So I thought about it.

13
00:00:29.933 --> 00:00:32.833
My father is the president of the Jiangzhou Chamber of Commerce

14
00:00:32.933 --> 00:00:35.400
I have an obligation to the nation during my period

15
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.566
The development of enterprises makes a contribution

16
00:00:37.766 --> 00:00:41.100
After all, businesspeople can't just make money.

17
00:00:41.166 --> 00:00:43.500
Thank you so much, Miss Li.

18
00:00:43.733 --> 00:00:45.400
Thank you, Aunt Li

19
00:00:46.766 --> 00:00:49.166
Mr. Black, what do you mean?

20
00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:50.866
It means nothing

21
00:00:50.933 --> 00:00:53.100
Normal business conduct

22
00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.966
No matter how much more he pays

23
00:00:54.966 --> 00:00:57.066
I will add 10 million

24
00:00:59.466 --> 00:01:00.500
Go ahead.

25
00:01:01.733 --> 00:01:02.633
I quit

26
00:01:04.333 --> 00:01:06.166
Didn't it just increase to 100 million?

27
00:01:06.166 --> 00:01:09.066
Then let's spend 110 million to prepare the contract

28
00:01:09.066 --> 00:01:09.966
Ah yes yes yes

29
00:01:09.966 --> 00:01:11.866
Good Miss Li

30
00:01:12.133 --> 00:01:13.566
What about the 110 million?

31
00:01:13.566 --> 00:01:14.700
I'll give you 100 million.

32
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:15.866
You pay ten million

33
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.666
How about I give you 20% of the shares then?

34
00:01:20.766 --> 00:01:22.300
Mr. Song, this is the contract

35
00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:23.233
Please transfer the account.

36
00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:29.800
Thank you so much, Mr. Song

37
00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:30.833
Happy cooperation

38
00:01:30.966 --> 00:01:31.966
Happy cooperation

39
00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.666
Shaoyang, don't be happy too early.

40
00:01:36.166 --> 00:01:36.933
What do you mean?

41
00:01:36.933 --> 00:01:40.000
You spend all your time at home to buy a useless boy

42
00:01:40.266 --> 00:01:42.866
I'm just waiting to see how you pay and go bankrupt

43
00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:44.666
Dad did nothing wrong

44
00:01:44.733 --> 00:01:47.366
Yo yo boy

45
00:01:47.366 --> 00:01:50.933
Your father is about to take you to the streets to beg for food

46
00:01:50.933 --> 00:01:51.766
Now.

47
00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.400
Marco, the richest man in North America, announced today

48
00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.066
Interested in buying a building's magical new energy battery
