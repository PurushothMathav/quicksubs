00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.960
When you eat, don’t ask for food.

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.019
By the way, you've eaten too much,

3
00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:06.980
Director An's life is so bad that he knows he's going to the forest.

4
00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:10.200
Just listen to the Dragon King's call, and Zhentong calls to come to the forest,

5
00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.420
Yesterday it was explained that he is the Dragon King of the Li family,

6
00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.930
Dragon King, you said that he is an underdog in the Dragon King's shop and cannot be used as a slave.

7
00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:18.910
Why is he simply the Dragon King?

8
00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:20.690
Temple King, Temple King, Temple King, Temple King,

9
00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:23.230
temple king, temple king,

10
00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.530
Temple King, Temple King, Temple King, Temple King, Temple King,

11
00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:27.130
Temple King, Temple King, Temple King, Temple King,

12
00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:30.130
Temple King, Temple King, Temple King, Temple King, Temple King, Temple King, Temple King, Temple King, Temple King, Temple King, Temple King, Temple King, Temple King, Temple King, Temple King,�

13
00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:31.690
You come here to make me angry

14
00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:32.890
Have I given up?

15
00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:34.770
Everything is for me

16
00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:35.710
OK your mother

17
00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.230
The other one was forgotten and repaired before.

18
00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:39.650
You were acting like this yesterday

19
00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:42.870
It's not because I pay any price, it's a felony.

20
00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.130
Already shelled message content

21
00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:45.250
It's better not to listen to others

22
00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:48.450
Our last day is far apart.

23
00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:49.690
or him

24
00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:50.970
At this time, Guan Rongdi Palace

25
00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:52.350
But I'm just talking about him

26
00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.010
It will only bring destruction to us

27
00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:55.450
What kind of woman are you?

28
00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:56.690
Pay special attention to you

29
00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:58.650
You can always get more lost

30
00:00:58.650 --> 00:00:59.390
You think it is

31
00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:00.690
Before you see me this afternoon

32
00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:01.390
You jump left and right

33
00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:02.090
That's one

34
00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:04.450
You've never really had a chat. Let's go.

35
00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:05.810
I don’t want the last memory

36
00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:06.670
I was in pain

37
00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:08.170
I really succeeded in understanding

38
00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:10.830
For us Chu family members, they are just outsiders.

39
00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.150
Then you'll see what happens later

40
00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.250
That last side

41
00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:14.170
Too bad

42
00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:15.230
You deserve this too

43
00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.290
What's going on? Meet me outside.
