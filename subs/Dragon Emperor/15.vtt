00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.980
Okay, okay, okay,

2
00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:04.100
You should be such a weak hot father,

3
00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:06.120
It seems to me that you died first rather quickly,

4
00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:09.040
The dead one is not enough to pass, I just asked him to train the old one,

5
00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:12.220
He came to correct his mistakes and understand, I tell you,

6
00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:14.160
You are not of noble birth,

7
00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:16.020
There is no way to increase wealth,

8
00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:18.720
You can only eat the lowest level of feeling in this matter,

9
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.840
What qualifications do you have to compare with powerful people like us?

10
00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:24.640
We teach, like scolding,

11
00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:26.580
There are things that should be done honestly,

12
00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.840
This is, it is dangerous to have resistance,

13
00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:32.119
Just looking for death

14
00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:33.660
He, Mr. Luo from the Northern Territory

15
00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:36.800
Also stay with us in front of me and look at you

16
00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.240
Yes, not soon

17
00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:39.540
A must today

18
00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.000
People like me think that I have four great values

19
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:42.920
Okay

20
00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.460
The following things to beat the odds

21
00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:46.540
This is the fate I deserve

22
00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:48.880
Just Pingkan's logic will be a little longer

23
00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:51.050
like the dead

24
00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:52.670
I'll wait until you die

25
00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.150
It's your supreme beauty that seems to be able to

26
00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:58.190
This is how you adjust Na Hao's subordinates

27
00:00:58.190 --> 00:00:59.470
Do you still dare to rely on brilliance?

28
00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:01.230
Uncle, don’t you need to move?

29
00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.130
I'll tell you what to say

30
00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:06.470
How dare you admit me

31
00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:09.980
Uncle, I’m so used to it.

32
00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:14.320
Uncle animal, please don’t die, it’s clear

33
00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:16.190
If you don't care about him anymore, he wants to die.

34
00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:17.370
I can't ignore you

35
00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:21.410
He knows everything about you and your family.

36
00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:22.970
If you get back together with him again

37
00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:24.130
Don’t talk about Bai Wan’s investment

38
00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:25.470
You will also be banned

39
00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:26.750
your efforts over the years

40
00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:28.410
It's a hundred fees. I understand.

41
00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.030
I've had enough of you

42
00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:31.890
It's one thing to die

43
00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.090
It’s no one’s fault

44
00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:38.520
Your critical red industry apology will usually be

45
00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:39.680
Write accurately and check the front
