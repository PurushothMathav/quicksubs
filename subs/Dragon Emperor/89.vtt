00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:03.440
A breath continues to come in,

2
00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:05.700
The quarrel started again, the quarrel started again, the quarrel started again, the quarrel started again, the quarrel started again,

3
00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.840
The quarrel started again, the quarrel started again, the quarrel started again, the quarrel started again, the quarrel started again,

4
00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:11.460
The quarrel starts again, the quarrel starts again,

5
00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.000
The quarrel started again, the quarrel started again, the quarrel started again, the quarrel started again, the quarrel started again, the quarrel started again,

6
00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:16.200
If they start arguing again,

7
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.040
The quarrel started again, the quarrel started again, the quarrel started again, the quarrel started again,

8
00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:21.120
The quarrel started again, the quarrel started again, the quarrel started again, the quarrel started again, the quarrel started again, the quarrel started again, the quarrel started again, and the quarrel started again.

9
00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:22.980
Arguing, quarreling again,

10
00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:32.840
If they start arguing again,

11
00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:34.160
I can't be useless again

12
00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:35.720
Can't find a job to support photography

13
00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:37.800
So Da Huan can save Yan Ye

14
00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:41.140
I want to remarry you, right?

15
00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:43.940
I am curious and will bring you in to see the master.

16
00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:44.760
This last face

17
00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:45.760
I want you

18
00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:47.300
Although I still have the idea to move forward
