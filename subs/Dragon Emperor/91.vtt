00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.720
I thought that in addition to bearing evil,

2
00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:03.660
As long as you give the order, you will also be trained.

3
00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:05.660
As you. One year of training,

4
00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:08.000
There is constantly looking at what is good about it.

5
00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:13.740
I see you are you, you are Tanda,

6
00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.140
I thought your Christian name was Gundam,

7
00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.100
I thought you all would express your feelings normally.

8
00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:21.810
I thought we had to go online without rushing,

9
00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:24.630
The qualifications for the above-mentioned consecutive student cards are the last.

10
00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:25.730
Not even done.

11
00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:30.480
You can use something whose success is unclear to your karma,

12
00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:31.640
What exactly is it?

13
00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:32.940
What sex did I press?

14
00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.380
It is still desirable to compare exactly

15
00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.260
I also hope that grandpa will continue

16
00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.660
Helped millions of memories to live with Aya girl

17
00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:40.140
rise up in mysterious unison

18
00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.800
Call it your way

19
00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.360
I donâ€™t know if it comes from every mystery.

20
00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:45.240
of no use

21
00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:46.700
Really enter the woman

22
00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:48.180
Don't have a breath and don't pretend to be sorry

23
00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:50.260
Because grandpa never screamed when he couldn't connect his hands.

24
00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:52.080
So whatever you can imagine comes in

25
00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:53.420
Don't tell me to go in without even a glance

26
00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:54.920
I almost died laughing

27
00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:56.260
She can go in and renew the order.

28
00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.220
I've heard both and I've heard both

29
00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:00.000
That's quite unprecedented

30
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.940
I'll think about it today

31
00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:03.080
But you tell me

32
00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:06.360
What other materials do I need?

33
00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.360
Don't go to the source

34
00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.740
You have dozens of small platforms that are over a hundred years old, that is,
