00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:03.000
What's going on? Why don't you go?

2
00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:04.780
Other house. Other house. Other house.

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:17.100
Other house. Other house. Other house. Other house. Other house. Other house. Other house. Other house. Other house. Other house. Other house. Other house. Other house. House. Other house.

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.780
That is to say, if you act too hard, you will cause trouble to the common people.

5
00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:21.320
I also want him with Wan

6
00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:22.100
I'll go out first

7
00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:26.190
Ask me to show up to you if you need something

8
00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:27.800
Live every day

9
00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:30.440
I'm crying again. It's better for you to go first.

10
00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:33.440
I have something to explain to you, so I'm here.

11
00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:34.720
The handbook is also there

12
00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:35.660
Where are these people?

13
00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:36.960
This is now implemented

14
00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.280
I can't actually dare to come.

15
00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:40.280
Go ahead and kill me with one look

16
00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:43.740
How much more should I be stopped by your heart?

17
00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:45.120
I'm not a good boy

18
00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.720
Look, I'm still angry now

19
00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.420
I have just one more thing to do about my funeral.

20
00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:51.360
We are deeply in love

21
00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:53.980
It’s okay to allocate you a day

22
00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:56.120
I started with sixteen characters, if in

23
00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:56.780
i will start

24
00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:58.360
You live or die

25
00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.300
You are the end of my family

26
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.780
But you don’t have the right to speak

27
00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:03.260
Don't take my old man's time
