00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.240
Isn't this too quick? Don't wait for me.

2
00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:04.550
Monthly Rich Man to Xinming

3
00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:08.029
In this way, we, the mysterious people who can steal lives from the hands of Yanglou,

4
00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:10.310
One by one, the first one cheers

5
00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.550
Let's go. Let's go there too.

6
00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:15.150
Get out of your way

7
00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:18.830
Oops, let's go down and teach you a lesson.

8
00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:20.200
I'll teach first

9
00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:22.950
Come and try if you want it

10
00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:23.670
Just don't leave

11
00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:24.350
Oh, right?

12
00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:26.770
Come on, come on, try. Don't listen.

13
00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:27.990
Not you kid

14
00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.910
The church was in chaos when I was young

15
00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.189
Our five father-in-laws are on a trial basis

16
00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:33.770
That's my older brother who wears exactly the same clothes as me

17
00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:35.310
You are the one being analyzed

18
00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:37.150
Of course you have less money to get a home.

19
00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:38.990
My marriage to Gu Tingzhou

20
00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.850
I don't agree

21
00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:41.110
I won't marry you either

22
00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:42.790
You are really my sister-in-law, so that’s not okay

23
00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:44.870
Your family and marriage?

24
00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:45.650
How to control gas

25
00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:47.630
The second-rate world that our family and girls often live in

26
00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:48.950
Now it’s just home

27
00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:50.270
The mediocrity of our hometown

28
00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:52.350
Get to know the homeless second young man and Xinjiang

29
00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.110
You look like nothing to others

30
00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:55.350
Help me yourself

31
00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.870
Follow Guyuanzhou again

32
00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:58.970
Received some love affairs from the upper part of the book

33
00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:59.950
Why don't you start a ceremony first?

34
00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:02.210
Don't let him hurt you, sir.

35
00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:04.230
The hero is smiling today

36
00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.710
What did you just say to sing?

37
00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:09.910
Brother in the eyes

38
00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:11.370
Let's let it go

39
00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:13.270
This is the lackey of Era State.
