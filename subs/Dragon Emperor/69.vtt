00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.150
You seem to be wearing a hat.

2
00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:04.530
Forget it, if I hadn’t made you feel wronged by Lu today,

3
00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:05.990
I don't want to take you there yet.

4
00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.450
I have no unclear wishes. You didn't do anything by looking for the letter.

5
00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:10.340
So are you feeling unwell?

6
00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.960
It’s not me, it’s my grandpa,

7
00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:16.480
In the late stages of the case, Shinichi used all the available methods.

8
00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.280
Or if you can't try to be in love with each other.

9
00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.200
Now there are only those who want the king,

10
00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.940
Only by giving me a new female burden can I fully save my grandfather's life.

11
00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:24.980
So no matter what the cost,

12
00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:27.600
I asked Wang Kaigong to help me.

13
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.120
Then it's really nice of you to meet me

14
00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:30.340
He just didn't want this universe

15
00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:31.580
I should be able to get in and out

16
00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:32.920
It's a shame what you said is true

17
00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:34.880
I haven't had a break in and out of course

18
00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:38.140
Although I said you told me you were right

19
00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:39.500
You are the bottom function of the dragon

20
00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:40.520
It's Reiwu

21
00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.360
I was worried before

22
00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:43.580
I went to visit Dandan recently.

23
00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:44.860
Do I need to turn on the machine?

24
00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:47.240
Worried about not having enough time, unexpectedly

25
00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:49.380
It’s great that some people can take medicine now

26
00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:50.940
I'm too airy

27
00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.400
What have you handed in again?

28
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.690
I was saved with me

29
00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:57.000
Want to hand

30
00:00:59.250 --> 00:00:59.950
I have the worst grades, right? That’s great, right?

31
00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:02.110
But you have to prepare well in advance
