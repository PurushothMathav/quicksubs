00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:01.780
I already want money quickly.

2
00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:04.800
Tomorrow I will write about Haotian Group’s tens of billions of resources.

3
00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:08.240
I became the underling of the Daxia entertainment circle by his side.

4
00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.080
I absolutely cannot use a fool like you.

5
00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:16.370
why are you laughing.

6
00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:18.910
Laughing at you looks like a small town, consuming tens of billions of Tian Group’s resources.

7
00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:20.890
It's me who deserves a penny. I want to bear nothing.

8
00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:22.970
Let you do it. What is this? What?

9
00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:25.250
What? I heard it right. I still meant it.

10
00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.030
Why don't you say anything? Even Hu will listen to you.

11
00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.970
Otherwise. I think you were taken away by the money and let it go on your own.

12
00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:34.190
I understand. It’s all your fault, Hu Yeqing.

13
00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:34.790
Do you know you heard it right. Do you know you heard it right. Do you know you heard it right. Do you know you heard it right. Do you know you heard it right. Do you know you heard it right.

14
00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:36.110
everything you said today

15
00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:37.090
If spread

16
00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:38.890
If you die a hundred times

17
00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:40.050
He appeared in front of me

18
00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:40.910
I dare to say it

19
00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:42.390
It's really hopeless Goodbye

20
00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:43.430
we need to understand

21
00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:45.230
After all, people like him

22
00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:46.270
Too many wrong words

23
00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:48.030
You have nothing else to do, right?

24
00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.230
actually worry

25
00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.390
Let's not talk anymore

26
00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:52.310
The good things between me and Qianqian

27
00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:54.170
Too much to look at you

28
00:00:59.230 --> 00:00:59.970
It's okay if I apologize to you here

29
00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:03.110
I'll let him treat me well for you and I'll listen

30
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:08.880
I'll accept the fist, please wait a moment
