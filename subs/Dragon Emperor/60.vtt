00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:05.170
I heard the package from the monk said that you were divorced before you left home?

2
00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:08.240
Like a son-in-law, there is no man. We both were thrown.

3
00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:12.220
The queen's mother is so broken, and we both have nothing to do with each other anyway.

4
00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:14.180
But it doesn't matter

5
00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:18.190
Come on, I heard that the process department can't do it.

6
00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:22.040
He said that you are strong in three years and you have done enough to take care of yourself.

7
00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:23.910
For example, at the end

8
00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.110
The customer's cloud love is revealed

9
00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:27.150
Oulun Lunlun

10
00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:28.850
Back then, even if you were willing, nothing was enough.

11
00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:30.590
You said I was in the future

12
00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:31.830
will be very long

13
00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.890
Is it a kind of

14
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.990
I said you guys

15
00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:38.340
Membership again

16
00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:39.700
Not a casual visitor

17
00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:40.840
Only how high the party is

18
00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:42.120
Come in this double page

19
00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:43.350
Then take care of it

20
00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.510
If you are this hotel

21
00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:45.350
Real member

22
00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:47.390
Then I will naturally help you drive him out

23
00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:48.250
Then you are not

24
00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:50.890
And he said he had a membership card with me.

25
00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:52.390
It's not easy for him to know how to do it

26
00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:55.970
I'm very good at translating

27
00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:56.810
I tell you

28
00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:58.510
I am meaningfully unhappy

29
00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:00.430
You can let the emperor take you

30
00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.600
The world is a nine-day service

31
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.580
And it makes me open and invisible

32
00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.510
Of course I haven't met this big guy yet.

33
00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:08.660
what is this

34
00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:09.820
You want to play devils

35
00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:11.340
I trust people like you

36
00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:12.910
How is it possible to see

37
00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:14.970
But it’s also Yonguan

38
00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.990
The Lord calls me and you passersby

39
00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:19.130
I don’t care and I don’t take you with me

40
00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:20.770
Is it okay to be in something this tall and big?
