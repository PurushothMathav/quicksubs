00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:02.630
Xiaogu, you don’t have to go to work today

2
00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:04.270
Are you laughing at me?

3
00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:08.189
Teacher Hu and Sister Wanwan went to participate in the Baiyi Resource Thousand Yuan I

4
00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:10.610
Am I qualified to be Xiao Zhuli’s boyfriend?

5
00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:11.770
Naturally, it’s a holiday

6
00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:13.150
You said it was there

7
00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:16.510
Dingjin Mingliu from all over Jiangsu Province will attend.

8
00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:19.070
There will definitely be lots and lots of delicious food

9
00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:20.610
What a pity

10
00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:21.670
You think everyone will too

11
00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:23.330
Just for food

12
00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:25.740
This is it, this top-notch show

13
00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.200
The ingredients are all sourced from stores across the country.

14
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:29.540
Ever since you came here

15
00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.160
Don't tell me you want to be sure

16
00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:33.880
They are all Mi Xin Samsung, what are you?

17
00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:35.280
I don’t want to die

18
00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:36.340
Feeling tired too

19
00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:40.200
I want to eat the teacher's arrival

20
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.860
I'll take it out and feed it to you until here

21
00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:43.500
How could I forget that?

22
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:44.720
Are you the teacher's husband?

23
00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:47.000
Fortunately, there will be an invitation from Han. It’s delicious.

24
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:49.520
I want you to bring a little more to me, right?

25
00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:50.620
Dad's party isn't over yet

26
00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:52.540
Why don't you come out except the teacher?

27
00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:53.700
Clean again

28
00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:56.360
I came out on my own, I thought

29
00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.580
Except the teacher also wrote that you asked about an individual

30
00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:02.210
Sorry

31
00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:03.670
I seem to have said the wrong thing

32
00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:04.730
You said it right

33
00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:06.170
Sorry for coming

34
00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:07.630
Don't be too sad

35
00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:10.130
When I come into contact, I still have you in my heart

36
00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:11.810
Even if nothing happens, he will show off and run away

37
00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:13.350
What did we get married yesterday?
