00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:07.140
Citizens perform together!

2
00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:08.740
Citizens perform together! Citizens perform together!

3
00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:10.760
Citizens perform together! Citizens perform together!

4
00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:12.440
Citizens perform together! Citizens perform together!

5
00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:14.040
Citizens perform together! Citizens perform together! Citizens perform together! Citizens perform together!

6
00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:18.180
Citizens perform together! Citizens perform together! Citizens perform together! Citizens perform together! Citizens perform together!

7
00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:19.680
Citizens perform together! Citizens perform together! Citizens perform together! Citizens perform together! Citizens perform together! Citizens perform together!

8
00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.460
Citizens perform together! Citizens perform together!

9
00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.380
Citizens perform together! Citizens perform together!

10
00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:25.700
Citizens perform together! Citizens perform together! Citizens perform together! Citizens perform together! Citizens perform together! Citizens perform together! Citizens

11
00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:27.560
Acting together! Citizens acting together! Citizens acting together!

12
00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:30.220
Citizens perform together!

13
00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.580
Citizens perform together! Public

14
00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:40.780
I apologized to him first and asked him eight questions. I can't stand the boss.

15
00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:41.500
Don't want to wear it

16
00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.660
Just thinking about the evil scene will clear it up

17
00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:45.620
How many times have we been beaten?

18
00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:47.480
There's a good chance I won't let you go because I'm dissatisfied with you.

19
00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:48.560
But it's hard to say

20
00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:50.040
Only red-faced and frustrated

21
00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:51.600
How mature do you think you are?

22
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:52.380
Advise again and again

23
00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:53.980
No sense of the past

24
00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:56.820
As soon as I make a wish again, I will do the same

25
00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:57.960
Haven’t strayed from ghosts and thought of evil yet

26
00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:00.160
Does everyone’s organization have photos or not?

27
00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:01.240
To kill you

28
00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:02.540
Keep me from finding a job

29
00:01:04.569 --> 00:01:05.410
You can't bully someone for a living and don't let him

30
00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.950
Even if you live and die in Suqiu, you will do the same

31
00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.510
But it’s also Xiaobei who cares about the family.

32
00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:11.390
Is it okay to be the head of the family? Right?

33
00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:12.770
You don't need me as your overlord

34
00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:14.410
Fei Fei, you are such a nobody

35
00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:15.990
i am enough

36
00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.510
But Zhao Litong is a good son

37
00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:18.290
Your dad knows

38
00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:21.630
You have such a soft-spoken face, you understand.

39
00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.910
You are just a grudge against the head of the family.

40
00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:25.930
I'm afraid that Su Qiu, who will die later, is having diplomatic relations.

41
00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:27.410
Zixi within five minutes

42
00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:28.810
I want another thousand yuan on site

43
00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:29.770
Looking at the chicken head

44
00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:31.650
Otherwise, I'll take care of you
