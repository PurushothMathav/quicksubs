Please enter, did you find the error?

2
00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:06.810
He is saying, do you think you are meeting someone?

3
00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.510
You know how to blow things up, dad, are you going to blow me up?

4
00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:13.870
How do you calculate the money? Is money more difficult?

5
00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.260
Thinking back to now, Dad, I had fried food,

6
00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:20.870
You asked me to do it for you, that's it,

7
00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:22.510
He Fu, how can you reach it?

8
00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.890
What can you do?

9
00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:28.370
I'll take care of my family's affairs.

10
00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:31.610
You once, please give it to you quickly, is it until now?

11
00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.070
Dad, I’m doing this for your own good,

12
00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:36.290
Let me give it to him until now, impossible,

13
00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:38.330
If you are serious about these,

14
00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:39.310
I'll look back

15
00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:40.610
Just started hiding

16
00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:42.570
Her third brother

17
00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:48.870
Return to the earth

18
00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:55.860
You first, don’t go up first, you go up first

19
00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:58.550
Thank you for your hard work. Come on first.

20
00:00:58.550 --> 00:00:59.170
It seems to be a finger

21
00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:00.410
Your previous family went bankrupt

22
00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:01.960
This is too overwhelming

23
00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:03.450
Such people stay in the market

24
00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:04.330
It was me too

25
00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:05.230
I am from you

26
00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:06.810
How about the team's way out?

27
00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:09.430
No, no, no, no, you go first, you go first.
