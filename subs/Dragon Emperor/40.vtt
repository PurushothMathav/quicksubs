00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.940
We still have to go through other people's land cards.

2
00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.780
Mom, I’ll give you the flying dragon. Up, I’ll give you the flying dragon’s land card.

3
00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:08.610
He also said that Dahua does not support it.

4
00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:10.620
Okay, which ones are the flying dragons?

5
00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:11.280
Which ones are flying dragons? Which ones are flying dragons?

6
00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.320
I often send you invitations all day long

7
00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.540
But wait a minute. Brother Bei, we have a date.

8
00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:16.780
I don’t like it either

9
00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:19.260
He doesn't have food, a car, or a car.

10
00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:20.340
What else is going on with you?

11
00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:21.200
I said it all

12
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.540
One day, it was because he was in a bad mood that he acted like this

13
00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:25.800
He's usually very reliable. You're not allowed to say that about him.

14
00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:34.810
None of it. The last drop of flavor is still the same.

15
00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:37.330
What he pointed out is why he is not allowed to have no results.

16
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.140
How come there is so much resistance now?

17
00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:42.240
A few of the worst ones

18
00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:43.940
How did this happen?

19
00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:45.480
How did this get to this point?

20
00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:45.920
How did this get to this point?

21
00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:46.240
How did this get to this point?

22
00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:46.840
How did this get to this point?

23
00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.360
How did this get to this point?
