00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:02.020
I'm afraid that we won't be in the same place.

2
00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:04.050
Get him out of the family!

3
00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:06.590
I beg you, give me more money,

4
00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:08.250
The other owners are confused!

5
00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:13.630
Have you seen him? He came down again and begged me for blessings?

6
00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.460
If you don’t want to be so arrogant, who else wants us to die?

7
00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:25.250
Who is he? What does he do?

8
00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:28.280
You are so afraid, the first three come,

9
00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.020
He knows everything about what happened the day before yesterday.

10
00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.540
You are Duduzui first,

11
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.580
This great incident was ruined,

12
00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:36.900
Our front cock cock cock cock,

13
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:38.200
This is not enough

14
00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:40.550
He keeps money like this

15
00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:45.100
All materials and inspections were handed over to the Hu Nu Gang

16
00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:47.140
Your husband is older

17
00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:48.540
But green green green

18
00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:51.030
There are decent people in my family

19
00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.590
Running with you will make me better

20
00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:53.670
I'm ready to help

21
00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:56.570
leave it to the political officer but mr.

22
00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:58.890
Let this marriage happen

23
00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:02.490
I can't say that anymore, Mr. Shifen

24
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.180
We're all wrong about how much

25
00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:06.040
I can't go to this material

26
00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:06.920
One click of the rope and it comes out

27
00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:09.540
Mr. Direction Security, you two

28
00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.420
Don't hit me, I'll hit you

29
00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:13.120
The road board where you put this thing of mine

30
00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:14.600
This kind of people will deal with it.

31
00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:15.800
On you now

32
00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.380
I'm dead now on you

33
00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:17.940
OK this

34
00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:19.320
You can't escape anyone

35
00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.380
No, don't run away from me

36
00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:22.520
On you now

37
00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.910
I don't want to hand anything over

38
00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:26.250
Don't run away from me

39
00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:36.970
Ever since you let my little brother Bei go

40
00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:38.610
I don’t want to promise you now either
