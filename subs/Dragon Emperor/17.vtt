00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:07.370
We all show up, is it so special?

2
00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:09.190
Go up, the truth is established and brought with you.

3
00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:12.610
It's you who came here again, baby, who are you here?

4
00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:14.410
Logically speaking, these are rude,

5
00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:17.110
On the shoes, okay, you just put on the shoes,

6
00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:19.290
The adult standing behind the Red Stone Society,

7
00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:22.710
Okay? It’s just an adult,

8
00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:25.070
Do you understand me maybe? It's individual,

9
00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:27.730
Can I do Bai Zhuzi? Is it really a big business?

10
00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:29.990
Look at the family, what you said is really true.

11
00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:32.930
It’s over, it’s a big casting, it’s not true to the object,

12
00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:35.450
You guys, I haven’t finished speaking yet?

13
00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:37.190
That's just a rumor, he just,

14
00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:39.550
Sir, you are a running shovel next to me.

15
00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:41.770
It’s not the time to meet and have expectations

16
00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:43.890
Now's your chance to know who you're talking to here

17
00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:44.810
At the same time

18
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.080
The princess is smart

19
00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:47.620
I was deceived by a favor

20
00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:49.930
His original power was regarded as the most powerful

21
00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:52.020
He is just an adult next to me

22
00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.600
A messenger running around

23
00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.670
I can deceive you in just a few words

24
00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:56.910
Five chapters in five families

25
00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:57.950
Sir, do I know?

26
00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.300
Ha ha ha ha

27
00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:02.120
Stand and put it down at the same time

28
00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:03.980
I'm also curious when I

29
00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:05.379
Become someone else's scapegoat
