10
00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:42.400
In the past, Brother Haojun said goodbye clearly.

11
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:43.960
You won’t get this far in practice

12
00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:45.780
And he can become a big star before now

13
00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.260
It's all about him step by step

14
00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:48.540
Came here on my own

15
00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:50.080
The little brain understands when it is established

16
00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:51.740
I don't know what kind of high voice you have

17
00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:52.860
That's my money

18
00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:53.740
Able to enlighten the mind and spirit

19
00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:54.880
There is really no light

20
00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:56.000
To achieve a chaotic chase

21
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.640
That's because

22
00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:57.980
I endured the long road upward

23
00:00:57.980 --> 00:00:58.960
Red Hao’s lineup

24
00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:00.600
There's also a film about Qiu Nianpao that's extraordinarily good.

25
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:01.580
You go first

26
00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:03.400
Are you still too messy to take yourself seriously?
