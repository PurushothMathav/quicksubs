00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.060
You and Sun are making trouble because of monkeys,

2
00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:09.000
Interrupting the cat, it also dies and is an important elasticity,

3
00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:11.220
Just to express myself, not to mention the ground,

4
00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:13.820
As an elder, it is not easy to call a housekeeper.

5
00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.960
This is not at home, it’s three pieces of noodles again,

6
00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:18.440
What happened that day? Because we set the price,

7
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.220
I'm not too dark. I heard you are already too divorced,

8
00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.120
I gave it to him, and I honestly wanted to have something to do with him.

9
00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:27.930
One by one, I will go to a divorce that sounds better,

10
00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:29.990
You are gone too. Bring it to me.

11
00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:31.510
You are giving what you haven’t eaten. Ask more,

12
00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:32.369
What do you want from me?

13
00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:35.030
Okay. At the same time, you know my heart, Xiaobei.

14
00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:36.190
you to your showbiz showbiz

15
00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:37.490
Actors are all bullied

16
00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.820
Come and give me some medicine, right?

17
00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:43.120
I'm bullied even if I'm given medicine

18
00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:44.240
First to learn

19
00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:45.300
No fun at all

20
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.060
What does this mean?

21
00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:46.900
This should be unknown

22
00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:48.560
Do you have the skills to count ten thousand words?

23
00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:49.300
This kind of order

24
00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:49.980
That's how it should be

25
00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:50.840
Who do I know?

26
00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:51.900
You know I haven't seen you

27
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:53.360
Like you come to medicine, just play

28
00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:54.620
Leaving is not a good thing

29
00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:55.820
Just in case I need something to eat

30
00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:56.360
do something

31
00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:57.420
Of course it's your responsibility
