00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.170
You should also look at the dog eyes that are looking at you today

2
00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:03.750
What kind of pollen is it?

3
00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:05.250
He didn't remember me

4
00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:07.190
What's the matter with you that warrants saying such a thing?

5
00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:08.510
God, do you remember to meet?

6
00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:09.770
You're such a good person yourself

7
00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:13.690
I've never seen anyone dare to talk to me like this when I'm this old

8
00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:15.270
I know you do it for my own good

9
00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:17.090
But now is not the time to really remember

10
00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:19.390
People like them had great time in previous lives

11
00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:20.250
Take a small photo

12
00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:21.390
We ordinary people

13
00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:22.270
I don't have to do anything

14
00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:24.210
A piece of water will kill us

15
00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:25.310
It sounds good, that's right

16
00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:26.470
My wife also came to see me

17
00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:27.690
I also metabolize husband and wife with me here

18
00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:29.590
No one should be angry with Korea

19
00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:31.470
I just wanted to fix you today

20
00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:32.990
He died before him

21
00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:36.350
I guess I can't have a boy with a boyfriend who is a few miles away.

22
00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:37.670
I found your sin

23
00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:38.570
I'm really not tough

24
00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:40.270
You actually want to die

25
00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:41.230
Then I promise

26
00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:45.490
Let him run back, boy

27
00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:47.230
The place I did just now was done with me.

28
00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:48.350
As long as you can fight

29
00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:49.270
I can't

30
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:52.000
Itâ€™s really me that so many people will not die

31
00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:55.220
He shouldn't have let go of my hand and died

32
00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:56.480
Are you two dead?

33
00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:57.500
Get out of here with me

34
00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.960
What kind of land sign is here that is subject to Chengyu?
