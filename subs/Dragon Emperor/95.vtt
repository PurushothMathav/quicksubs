00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:05.130
How many of these are you doing and how bad they are?

2
00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:07.370
Why did you eat it? Jump up quickly!

3
00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.970
You're missing, the chariot and the horse are the steadfast ones,

4
00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.190
Guan Wenche. What kind of house is this?

5
00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:16.890
Changing your name is for your own benefit and will be determined by your fate!

6
00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:19.400
You must achieve your goal, right!

7
00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:21.820
You're smiling the wrong way!

8
00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:23.960
I know you, you are not mistaken, are you?

9
00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.260
It will never be like ten years

10
00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:27.880
It is difficult for our army to advance

11
00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:29.800
The Empty Land State is incompetent and has become more powerful.

12
00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.900
One drop of eight exploded Yakumo

13
00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:34.120
pair pair pair pair pair

14
00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:35.160
An army that came together

15
00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.400
All went home

16
00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.280
it originally had something dark

17
00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.900
Then I am in uniform

18
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:41.140
to it become

19
00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:42.880
Donâ€™t count, right?

20
00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:44.540
Going there by the way

21
00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:45.940
Only then can you practice rolling

22
00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:47.660
Towards the real

23
00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:53.110
In fact, I want to be my father

24
00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:54.690
You just tended to actually

25
00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.330
The black gold I recycle is your order

26
00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:57.450
if this is true

27
00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:58.850
Can my grandfather also be saved?

28
00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:00.850
You stink, the rider can escape on his own

29
00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:02.710
When I take you in my mouth and let him scan you

30
00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:04.970
I'm sincere

31
00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:06.530
you have only seen let you

32
00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:08.710
With you, you give me memories

33
00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:09.850
This is my grandpa

34
00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:11.030
Say it, where is the mouth?

35
00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:12.050
You are just in front of grandpa
