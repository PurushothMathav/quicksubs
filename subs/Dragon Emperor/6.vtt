00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:02.340
It turns out that in your eyes, our feelings,

2
00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:04.220
Because you can buy food outside the line.

3
00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:06.780
Got it, that's right,

4
00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:09.560
Ten million, if you fail, you will not be charged this money.

5
00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:11.380
If you think the money is not enough,

6
00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:13.380
I can add another ten million,

7
00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:15.880
It’s just that you need to know the appropriate values ​​for the test.

8
00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:17.840
It pays money, our feelings,

9
00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:20.600
There are only tens of millions, and the longevity is so good. Today is our seventh year,

10
00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:22.920
I went to buy cakes in the morning, not the hotel,

11
00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.000
In exchange, it’s your wedding shoe art,

12
00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.860
Actually, thank you very much.

13
00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:31.500
I am very, three years old,

14
00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.860
Have you considered my feelings? Eat my food and use it in your house.

15
00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:35.440
I'm from below

16
00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:36.880
From step by step to becoming more fashionable

17
00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:38.420
Isn't it you who doesn't rely on you?

18
00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:40.560
I'm so disappointed, you know

19
00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:42.780
It was just a mine truck that our Lord sent the day before yesterday, right?

20
00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.820
I've prepared everything you need

21
00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:45.620
But I came

22
00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:53.210
You just don’t know anything about it

23
00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:54.770
I wanted to bring it with my own hands for you

24
00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:55.670
It seems now

25
00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:56.230
Do I want it?

26
00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:57.860
You take a broken building

27
00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:59.000
Just want to lie to me

28
00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.740
How ridiculous

29
00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:00.680
Ridiculous thing about you

30
00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:01.360
This is ignorant

31
00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:02.660
To my other family’s heirloom

32
00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:04.019
It can take the effort of ordering a dragon

33
00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.019
just my wife

34
00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:06.200
Only those who are qualified to wear

35
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.100
You are really a bit

36
00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:10.830
My kind of dragon-earth skill, dragon-earth skill

37
00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:11.810
But Long Di Kung

38
00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:14.090
above all secular forces

39
00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:16.790
I really shouldn't even think about dying.

40
00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:18.930
Don't say such meaningless words again. Understand.

41
00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.430
Your toys borrowed

42
00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:21.350
I don't want

43
00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:22.650
what i don't want

44
00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:23.830
You have to be angry too

45
00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:25.550
I'm not mad at you for what you want.

46
00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:26.410
these three years

47
00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:27.510
A role I don’t want to play

48
00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:28.990
Those directors will come to you

49
00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.870
Encounter before returning home

50
00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:30.770
It's not the last hour

51
00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:31.710
The other party will eventually go bankrupt

52
00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:32.470
This is the old house

53
00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:33.350
can get it all

54
00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:34.510
You can get everything good

55
00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:35.850
It's not that I'm leading him to help you

56
00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.230
This young son is Tianjin

57
00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:37.930
That is one

58
00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:39.870
I'm trying to stay on the front line so as not to start a feud.

59
00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:40.970
you on the front line

60
00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:44.230
I have no intention of saying it well, you guys

61
00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:46.370
You need extra money to do it

62
00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:47.630
No need to waste money

63
00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:50.750
And it can bring the career of money closer

64
00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:52.090
The existence of mother

65
00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:54.870
It’s the pace at which aristocrats and foreigners have money.

66
00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:56.390
Do you see what I said about you?

67
00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:57.370
You bought or borrowed

68
00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:58.530
Seeing you is him

69
00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.410
Why didn't you hold on so much?

70
00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:01.350
He pulled it like this

71
00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:02.690
I pulled our hands out

72
00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:03.430
how do you explain

73
00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:06.250
I don't need to explain my money to you

74
00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:07.510
I hope you don't want me
