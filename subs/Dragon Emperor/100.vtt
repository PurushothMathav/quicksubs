1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.960
I said, you never really understand,

2
00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:03.900
From now on, we part ways,

3
00:00:04.059 --> 00:00:04.820
Good so-called person.

4
00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:23.180
I, promise, dare not walk away from my farm, must.

5
00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:28.660
Well, this one is not based on agricultural products.

6
00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.520
Originally I didn't expect you to be in a hurry, but there are a lot of things in the information that I don't want to worry about.

7
00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:40.840
So I'll hold off for a moment.

8
00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:41.580
My family is very agricultural.

9
00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:43.740
Of course, after that, it was very easy for the Zhou family to turn on the phone,

10
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.260
I just buy agricultural products, don’t say yes, this god,

11
00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:47.220
Can't tell here.

12
00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:48.500
Listening to electronics is no longer a priority

13
00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.920
So it must be said that we will be Miss Special Evil

14
00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:52.080
For example

15
00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:53.160
I made it for you myself

16
00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:55.120
Because it’s just you who come here and you figure it out

17
00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:57.240
I can only let Meng Meng understand what I am doing when I go back.

18
00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:58.840
The test of three people

19
00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:00.580
Emotions that are neither cosmic nor come up

20
00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:01.740
Want to eat

21
00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.180
Since I promised you

22
00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.019
I won’t try it either

23
00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:04.800
And this thing

24
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.280
But everyone is facing my wish

25
00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:08.020
I didn’t hear that it wasn’t you who was responsible for the performance

26
00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:09.780
Do I still want to be a family member of this family?

27
00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:10.580
Not qualified yet

28
00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:11.980
Use mid-price qualifications

29
00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:13.020
Just let it go

30
00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:13.840
so application ms.

31
00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.240
Since I promised you

32
00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.000
Nor can I eat

33
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.500
I will put my name on the recruitment list in three days.

34
00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:21.300
I'll see you again in three days.
