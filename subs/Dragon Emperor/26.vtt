1
00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:03.910
One step away from my money will cost you your life.

2
00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:05.550
What do you three want to do?

3
00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:07.830
If I come here to stay home, I will go,

4
00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:08.810
You are still alive.

5
00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:10.830
Your union is all gone.

6
00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:11.950
I can't even help myself anymore.

7
00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:13.670
Hu Ye, itâ€™s not me.

8
00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:16.530
We go through, say oh my God,

9
00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.570
We usually weigh eighty-five pounds,

10
00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.730
You died today while Tian'er was here, embarrassing me

11
00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:23.890
Just because of such a person who can't do anything

12
00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:24.990
Can you afford it?

13
00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.590
Our poor respect for each other

14
00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:28.630
There is no way, dare to listen

15
00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:29.530
Why is this

16
00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:31.330
They speak out the ghosts

17
00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:32.409
Can you say no one?

18
00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:33.230
we will

19
00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:34.890
There is something about being in a circle

20
00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.970
I want to send it back to our three major families

21
00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:40.730
You're not qualified enough. Let's get in touch later.

22
00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:42.370
Often a few today

23
00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:43.950
Take him out of the library

24
00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.270
The book remembers me is very valuable

25
00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:46.270
Time is expensive

26
00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:47.630
He gave it to someone else

27
00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:50.630
I wish you ten times to leave some money

28
00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:51.470
I don't believe it

29
00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:52.810
We are Su Shan

30
00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:54.030
My second police trainer

31
00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.490
Become calmer

32
00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:56.670
As soon as you open the door, you have the power

33
00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:57.510
how do you eat

34
00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.250
I'm so brave

35
00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.130
Willing to carry the company for him

36
00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:04.310
Can I live with so many people, young man?

37
00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.830
You are always today

38
00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.910
We have three big and four big companies

39
00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:07.810
Together

40
00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:09.680
I am willing to start a family

41
00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:11.520
Four major Dan families are in shock

42
00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:12.880
The Wang family is willing

43
00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:13.760
Have you changed?
