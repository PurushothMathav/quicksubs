00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.080
you know, you know,

2
00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.460
Sir, I will rent it out by myself right now with this example,

3
00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:08.100
It's up to you. Please give me your hand just now,

4
00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:10.240
Help me find a home and a way out.

5
00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:12.860
Because you are responsible for what you said, your Zhao family,

6
00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:14.620
It has been passed down for less than a hundred years, but now,

7
00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:16.420
They were all employed by prominent ministers,

8
00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:18.780
I will be born in heaven in one step, and I will also look for three seasons in northern Jiangsu.

9
00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:20.460
Your Zhao family is at its peak,

10
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.640
You still need a way out from me.

11
00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:27.560
And you, this good son, first wanted to cut out my tongue,

12
00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.400
Later, a good order was issued, and I was ashamed to be in Sioux City.

13
00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.200
In his eyes, I'm just a woman who was abandoned by a woman

14
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.240
Not only do we respect the law of knowing the person who has been connected to the police for the following crimes:

15
00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:37.800
You give him to me

16
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.640
Can I help him if he is not convinced by those ten thousand pieces of evidence?

17
00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.580
Hierophant, your own son

18
00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:43.960
Or should you handle it yourself?

19
00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.240
My son, it’s all because of me

20
00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:48.060
Who will the teacher be promoted to?

21
00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:49.350
We commit suicide

22
00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.140
Okay, what do you have to say to us?

23
00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.240
Even if he is spiritual, no matter what

24
00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:56.920
It’s not like you’re in a hurry. Just tell us not to kill us.

25
00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.880
Do you believe him? Think about it

26
00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:01.620
No one can let him eat it

27
00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:05.480
Teacher, your son is more stubborn than you. Stop talking.

28
00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:07.560
He is not one of your brothers, it is a lie
