00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:03.910
Then, although it’s beautiful, I’m sorry,

2
00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:05.670
I have no plans to bombard you again, Mr. Zhang,

3
00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:07.340
Get up quickly.

4
00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:09.280
Why is this happening? Why do you want to continue with me?

5
00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.820
Can I pour it and still eat it? Should I continue?

6
00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:13.460
Come on, please ask and find someone to continue.

7
00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:16.600
For our banquet tonight, I will leave my home and Hongye’s things,

8
00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:18.600
I don’t want to continue this one,

9
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.120
Can you take care of it? When you get home,

10
00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:22.640
What is it?

11
00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:24.160
Once everything is resolved,

12
00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:25.800
I follow, I follow,

13
00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:27.700
It is common law and family knowledge,

14
00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.160
Above this karma, I follow,

15
00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:32.560
What’s more, I can directly think about the great potential behind the red industry.

16
00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:33.860
You are not a word, a non-word, a non-word

17
00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:35.520
You are the coolest person of your generation

18
00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.060
In fact, I really miss my last relationship with you

19
00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:39.740
Go home and remember that person

20
00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:42.100
My future is facing the consequences

21
00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:43.660
As long as I accomplish nothing

22
00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:44.420
oh god lord

23
00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.460
This is my copybook

24
00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:48.940
Then you ask me how I feel about it one day

25
00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:50.200
We agree to be brutal

26
00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:51.440
he feels you

27
00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:52.660
Do you want your life?

28
00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:54.420
Right? You understand what you are saying.

29
00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.780
Have you been asked about Qi Feng by me?

30
00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:58.840
Since I'm so grateful, I'm blushing

31
00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:00.200
Why don't you kneel down quickly?

32
00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:01.320
you let me come over

33
00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:02.500
Not enough to resign

34
00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:03.980
Build a family for a lifetime

35
00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:06.100
Then my morning and evening

36
00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.400
A family that exports finance

37
00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:11.720
It makes you more expensive and is more valuable to you

38
00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:13.040
What a bunch

39
00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:14.220
Zhaojia and Lijia

40
00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.820
If I could be with you

41
00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:17.160
That's where I'll be spending the night

42
00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:18.380
constituting trade

43
00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:20.840
The Sun Family's Oh Me

44
00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:23.770
Composition set to watch the night

45
00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:26.390
The former family is crawling

46
00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:30.090
Do you usually treat your ancestors like this? Do you understand?

47
00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:33.450
You think it's very breezy, right? It's not good. It's ridiculous.

48
00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:34.550
Also offended now

49
00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:35.530
You are looking for me to take out life

50
00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:37.530
A word from that family

51
00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:38.890
I can give you a shout

52
00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:39.850
Don’t let the family change

53
00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:41.150
My word

54
00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:43.130
Thinking in the Wusihua Family

55
00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:45.190
This is not rude

56
00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:47.170
It's a pity not to report the good news

57
00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:49.810
You want one or two dollars, which is good

58
00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:52.930
The next thing we need to do is formulate a plan with the game.

59
00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:54.430
Or take a look

60
00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:56.490
Some people use our family

61
00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.750
The scene where we formed a group of soldiers today

62
00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:03.330
It's better to cut off the straight head alone

63
00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.190
Look at how unique you are, how can you be together with a group of people?

64
00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:07.280
Let me see who dares
