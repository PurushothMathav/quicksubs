00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.410
I'll just say a word, please don't do it first.

2
00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:06.180
Okay, I don’t care about my identity,

3
00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:08.260
I won't give you general insight. A small country,

4
00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:10.960
The pie was cold and not tasty at all.

5
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:13.280
I came here today just to tell you,

6
00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:16.280
I have a boyfriend, and he will understand.

7
00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:18.740
After last night, don’t leave me alone.

8
00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:19.820
My boyfriend will be unhappy.

9
00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.180
You are indeed joking with me, right?

10
00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:25.660
Do you think I'm joking with you?

11
00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:26.680
Impossible

12
00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:27.760
Mom, stop stuttering

13
00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:29.540
You said you didn't have it

14
00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:33.100
Could it be that I am not allowed to lose anything?

15
00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:34.780
Hey, Qiaowan, where are you?

16
00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:37.080
I'm not that boring

17
00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:38.860
Let me introduce myself from now on

18
00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:40.880
I'm in a relationship with you, I guess you sympathize with me

19
00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:42.800
My love is to bully the noble

20
00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.000
Where have you been for a long time?

21
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.300
How many Lianxins are there?

22
00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:48.000
So scary

23
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.940
Foreigners are so at ease

24
00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:51.160
The union is not big

25
00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.560
It's not right that you're not good enough and it hurts you.

26
00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:55.020
It's a free push, right?

27
00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.040
I'll check. Don't talk too much.

28
00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:59.840
You really don’t look good either

29
00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.800
Although those who appear can give it to you, give it to you, give it to you

30
00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:04.519
I can go somewhere and write

31
00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:05.600
you work better than

32
00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:08.320
Do you really not want to fight? Just raise it.

33
00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:09.780
Although I don’t work much

34
00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:13.320
But it’s not as if little Meg is a mouthful of food for me.

35
00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.640
I just like little Meg.

36
00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:16.580
Nicely spoken Nuan Nuan
