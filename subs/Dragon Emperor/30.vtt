00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.500
Also, what kind of attitude is this when Caili is still walking along?

2
00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:09.700
You can see all your faults in front of you. What else did you say about the press service? I think you are just afraid of exposing your identity.

3
00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:15.640
Then your married wife knows that she is stirring up two rumors outside. She just divorced her ex yesterday and today she is

4
00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:19.300
The first few times I made the Sou She Wu Feng, you really had a bowl.

5
00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:20.000
What a bowl What a bowl

6
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.660
Xiao Wan is all true. You didn’t look for a job for so many years.

7
00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:29.680
His is you, a scheming married woman who found out that you agreed so readily yesterday.

8
00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:30.260
Li marriage suspicion

9
00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.020
Just forget about it all

10
00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:33.450
You also have the answer in your heart

11
00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:34.770
I have no intention of saying more

12
00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:35.430
My answer is

13
00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:37.300
I often believe it for a moment

14
00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.340
You really evaluated your own legal system

15
00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:40.700
It seems to me too

16
00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:42.840
Since that set of Song Shou incident, I

17
00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.020
mission in your mind

18
00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:45.040
i miss you

19
00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:46.340
Sure enough, it's still the same one

20
00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:47.600
A person like Huilihua

21
00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:50.260
Only then can we mention that the Yang money has been paid out.

22
00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:52.280
My old fattening

23
00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:53.820
Where you go

24
00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.580
This is Bai Yi’s resource

25
00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:58.060
And my thoughts on the trading pool

26
00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:59.060
something given out

27
00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.900
Our imprisonment

28
00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:00.780
Our relationship

29
00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.040
Remember not to go to jail

30
00:01:05.319 --> 00:01:06.340
Baiyi's resources

31
00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:07.460
Can you decide?

32
00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:08.360
Does he want to agree?

33
00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:09.220
my stuff

34
00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:10.840
Why can't I make the decision?

35
00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.540
You look pretty good pretending

36
00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.920
But I'm your man

37
00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:21.960
what are you doing

38
00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:27.300
His other woman

39
00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:28.600
People come to give alms

40
00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.860
You are really caring

41
00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:33.940
If he’s not this person, I don’t want my money.

42
00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:35.840
He himself can also gain some strength
