00:00:02.666 --> 00:00:06.300
I'm Dabao Dabao, you're the big brother, it's beautiful

2
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:08.466
You're going to keep a secret for us.

3
00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:09.166
Blue hair

4
00:00:09.166 --> 00:00:12.866
Daddy took us away from mom

5
00:00:12.866 --> 00:00:17.033
But I like to be able to sleep when my parents are not there

6
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:18.766
Live together

7
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.333
The seven of us can organize it openly

8
00:00:23.333 --> 00:00:26.733
Then we can make do with Mommy together

9
00:00:26.733 --> 00:00:27.933
I didn't pull a cat.

10
00:00:27.933 --> 00:00:30.400
But I didn't go to Beijing Kindergarten

11
00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:35.266
A little bit every week, he personally takes me to school

12
00:00:35.266 --> 00:00:38.000
I didn't make an even day for them

13
00:00:42.333 --> 00:00:43.733
Don't follow me

14
00:00:43.733 --> 00:00:46.033
I'm much better now I can walk by myself

15
00:00:47.866 --> 00:00:50.233
We're going to school today, Monday.

16
00:00:52.566 --> 00:00:53.366
teacher

17
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:55.000
What about the teacher?

18
00:00:55.566 --> 00:00:57.500
I know medicine is spread out

19
00:01:01.366 --> 00:01:03.866
You sent it, where are you now?

20
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.600
Hello lawyer

21
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:09.500
I am your son-in-law

22
00:01:10.133 --> 00:01:12.566
My milk wholesale is quite good, and I will live in the new hospital.

23
00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.666
After learning, grandma, you can have as much money as you want.

24
00:01:14.666 --> 00:01:17.966
I can't afford to raise my mommy, grandma wakes up

25
00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.266
These two kids are so similar to the ones I gave them when I was a child.

26
00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.166
Even more like Xiaochun, grandma

27
00:01:27.333 --> 00:01:28.700
How is your heart?

28
00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:29.866
Tomi is 12 years old

29
00:01:31.733 --> 00:01:33.166
Thank you for saving me.

30
00:01:33.166 --> 00:01:34.100
No effort

31
00:01:34.166 --> 00:01:35.300
Wait a minute.

32
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.966
Let my grandson Baron thank you well

33
00:01:38.966 --> 00:01:39.833
Baron

34
00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.100
You are an old lady

35
00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:43.800
Yeah girl

36
00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.066
What's your name?

37
00:01:45.066 --> 00:01:47.066
Grandma, I am a Chinese medicine practitioner.

38
00:01:47.066 --> 00:01:49.033
Single name one month grandmother

39
00:01:49.066 --> 00:01:53.266
Our mommy is the famous Moon God Doctor

40
00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:55.766
You see the Moon God Doctor?

41
00:01:55.766 --> 00:01:57.400
A hundred words is worth seeing.

42
00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:59.966
I know your grandfather for a long time

43
00:02:00.166 --> 00:02:02.333
I hugged you when you were a kid

44
00:02:02.333 --> 00:02:05.366
Back then, a baron ordered a doll, dear.

45
00:02:05.533 --> 00:02:08.233
But suddenly your grandfather moved to the country

46
00:02:08.266 --> 00:02:10.766
This marriage is over

47
00:02:10.766 --> 00:02:13.333
Grandpa moved to the country because of my disappearance

48
00:02:13.333 --> 00:02:14.900
Now I'm back

49
00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.700
The first medical family in the imperial capital

50
00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.800
I can finally see the light of day

51
00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.666
Grandma grows up happily for her children

52
00:02:21.666 --> 00:02:22.900
I'm not considering marriage

53
00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:27.366
But these two kids are so much like the baron, right?

54
00:02:27.533 --> 00:02:30.200
The baron is coming soon

55
00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.766
In case the baron sees the Four Treasures

56
00:02:31.766 --> 00:02:33.066
What should I do if Wubao wants to grab the baby?

57
00:02:33.066 --> 00:02:34.300
Oh no no no

58
00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.233
I have to go, go, go.

59
00:02:37.133 --> 00:02:38.600
Let's go
