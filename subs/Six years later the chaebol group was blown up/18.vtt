What about that woman?

2
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.333
Ogawa's allergies are cured

3
00:00:09.333 --> 00:00:10.300
What about the doctor aunt?

4
00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:12.766
The doctor's aunt is off work.

5
00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:14.400
Ok daddy

6
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.900
I like this toy car

7
00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:18.933
Can you buy me 4 more?

00:00:18.933 --> 00:00:21.266
I want to share it with my brothers and sisters

9
00:00:21.266 --> 00:00:22.133
Buy 4 more.

10
00:00:22.133 --> 00:00:23.800
You want 5 identical toys.

11
00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:27.100
The five treasures are divided into lamps, and the five grains are not abundant

12
00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.800
Did you learn idioms?

13
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.066
OK, I'll buy it for you.

14
00:00:30.066 --> 00:00:35.300
Thank you. Don't forget to send me to school every day. Okay.

15
00:00:37.133 --> 00:00:37.933
All right.

16
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.700
Remember to drink plenty of water when you go to school

17
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:42.600
Do you hear me?

18
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.400
Mom, you are optimistic, mommy.

19
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.866
Four treasures and five treasures. If you don't drink water, you will get sick. Okay?

20
00:00:47.866 --> 00:00:48.800
Go ahead.

21
00:00:50.333 --> 00:00:51.633

I'm going to school.

24
00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:00.700
Doctor

25
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.966
How can a doctor afford to drive such a nice car?

26
00:01:07.866 --> 00:01:09.466
Desert Vanity Woman

27
00:01:10.066 --> 00:01:12.100
The woman five years ago must not have been her
