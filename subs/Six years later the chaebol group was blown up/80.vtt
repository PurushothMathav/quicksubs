00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.633
You lied to me for five years

2
00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:02.666
Let bygones be bygones.

3
00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:05.900
Get out of here and don't show up in front of me and the new moon

4
00:00:05.966 --> 00:00:06.866
new moon

5
00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.600
It's so intimate

6
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:10.933
You really have the means

7
00:00:10.933 --> 00:00:12.533
He stole my man

8
00:00:12.533 --> 00:00:16.033
You said the gentleman was yours

9
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:18.633
Do you match?

10
00:00:19.266 --> 00:00:21.333
Not worthy of me

11
00:00:21.333 --> 00:00:23.466
The woman 6 years ago was Lin Xinyu

12
00:00:23.566 --> 00:00:25.566
Those five cubs are your children

13
00:00:25.566 --> 00:00:27.133
Ah, no.

14
00:00:27.133 --> 00:00:28.933
It's four, what do you say?

15
00:00:28.933 --> 00:00:31.433
Because one died

16
00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.833
What does it mean?

17
00:00:35.166 --> 00:00:36.400
I broke your leg

18
00:00:36.466 --> 00:00:37.700
The boat is dead

19
00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:39.033
What did you do to the boat?

20
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.500
I fed him a lot of fish

21
00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:42.400
Ha ha.

22
00:00:43.366 --> 00:00:47.700
It must have been hard when that brat died

23
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:48.500
That

24
00:00:49.766 --> 00:00:51.800
Lan Juan, go and save Erbao

25
00:00:52.466 --> 00:00:54.033
What happened to Huolongjuan?

26
00:00:54.766 --> 00:00:56.266
I broke your leg

27
00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.766
If my children were born

28
00:00:58.766 --> 00:01:00.100
I asked you to be buried with me

29
00:01:00.266 --> 00:01:03.433
Mommy, Erbao and I are fine

30
00:01:04.166 --> 00:01:05.400
Which one is Li Joker?
