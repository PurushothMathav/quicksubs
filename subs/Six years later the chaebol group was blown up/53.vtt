00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:02.233
I didn't expect Lin Xiaoxiao to be so vicious

2
00:00:02.466 --> 00:00:04.066
Ogawa is still so small

3
00:00:04.066 --> 00:00:05.800
That's what you did to my son

4
00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:07.366
It's a horse beast

5
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:08.866
Dr. Li Zhelin

6
00:00:08.866 --> 00:00:10.366
Lin Xiaoxiao ran away

7
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.733
Where did you run to?

8
00:00:12.733 --> 00:00:13.800
Get it back to me now

9
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:15.400
Li Xiaochun is his biological son

10
00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:16.466
How could he be so vicious?

11
00:00:16.466 --> 00:00:17.500
What does he want?

12
00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.566
Mr. Li has sent someone to search the whole process

13
00:00:20.533 --> 00:00:22.300
But Lin Xiaoxiao seems to have disappeared out of thin air

14
00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:23.833
I have a way too

15
00:00:28.533 --> 00:00:30.966
Why is Ogawa's life so miserable?

16
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.766
Assistant Gao, are you sure that Ogawa is dead?

17
00:00:39.066 --> 00:00:40.633
The young master died unexpectedly

18
00:00:40.766 --> 00:00:42.900
Can't find it dead

19
00:00:42.966 --> 00:00:45.266
Miss Lin, where did you go just now?

20
00:00:45.266 --> 00:00:46.566
Mr. Li is looking for you everywhere

21
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.433
What are you looking for me for?

22
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.400
Looking for you to go back and get married?

23
00:00:50.533 --> 00:00:53.433
The little young master has left, and the family is not in chaos. Heir

24
00:00:53.566 --> 00:00:56.466
Mr. Li wants you to go back and get married and have an heir

25
00:00:56.766 --> 00:00:58.266
Why don't you hurry up?

26
00:00:58.266 --> 00:01:00.066
The baron must be in a hurry

27
00:01:00.066 --> 00:01:02.500
Master, hurry up, hurry up!

28
00:01:03.866 --> 00:01:06.700
I should have killed that bastard Ogawa sooner

29
00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.366
Hmph Lin Xinyue

30
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.600
I'm about to become the mistress of Li's house
