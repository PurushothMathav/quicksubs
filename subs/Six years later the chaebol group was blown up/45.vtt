00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:01.533
My precious great-grandson

2
00:00:01.533 --> 00:00:03.633
Where did you run off to?

3
00:00:04.133 --> 00:00:05.800
I'm fine. I'm fine.

4
00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:08.133
Hanging out with friends

5
00:00:08.133 --> 00:00:11.166
But what's with the blood on your hand?

6
00:00:11.166 --> 00:00:13.500
That's my friend's blood

7
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:14.600
He is injured.

8
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:17.066
You can ask Ogawa if he is injured.

9
00:00:17.066 --> 00:00:19.600
Mommy, Ogawa, where are you going?

10
00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.300
Your dad is back.

11
00:00:23.333 --> 00:00:25.000
Dabao what

12
00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.433
Is Erbao hurt?

13
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:28.800
The cat will be back soon.

14
00:00:29.266 --> 00:00:31.366
What's the matter sir

15
00:00:31.466 --> 00:00:32.733
My second son was injured

16
00:00:32.733 --> 00:00:33.766
I have to go back right now

17
00:00:33.766 --> 00:00:34.566
Then I'll send you

18
00:00:34.866 --> 00:00:36.833
No need, take care of Ogawa

19
00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.766
Sir, I just saw the little master beside me

20
00:00:44.766 --> 00:00:45.900
Following a little boy

21
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:47.666
He looks very similar to the young master

22
00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:50.300
Could that boy be Dr. Lin's?

23
00:00:50.333 --> 00:00:52.700
What happened during the time that his Ogawa disappeared?

24
00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.600
The young master was taken away by a bodyguard in black

25
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.966
It should be Dr. Lin's son who saved the young master

26
00:00:56.966 --> 00:00:59.400
How did you boys grow up to be as small as Ogawa?

27
00:00:59.866 --> 00:01:00.800
Why aren't there any gifts?

28
00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.233
You are going to Dr. Lin's house.

29
00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:04.966
Thank you to our sophomore son
