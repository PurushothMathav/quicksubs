1
00:00:02.866 --> 00:00:05.966
The award I won with my own hands that year

2
00:00:06.133 --> 00:00:08.700
The most valuable honor in the Chinese music scene

3
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.233
It has developed into this scene

4
00:00:19.466 --> 00:00:21.733
You're annoying, you don't even count as a debut

5
00:00:21.733 --> 00:00:24.100
Why did you sneak into the scene of the awards ceremony?

6
00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:26.100
It's the Golden Melody Awards ceremony

7
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:28.200
You're not even a third-rate singer

8
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.033
Are you here to receive the award too?

9
00:00:31.566 --> 00:00:34.400
No, you're kind of self-aware

10
00:00:34.733 --> 00:00:38.066
After all, this is the top music hall

11
00:00:38.066 --> 00:00:40.166
You can't get in here, you trash

12
00:00:40.166 --> 00:00:42.366
I advise you to go back obediently

13
00:00:42.366 --> 00:00:45.300
So as not to be kicked out in full view of the public for a while

14
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.166
If someone hadn't invited me

15
00:00:47.166 --> 00:00:49.933
I still disdain to participate in such boring games

16
00:00:49.933 --> 00:00:53.166
Game, your breath is bigger than athlete's foot

17
00:00:53.166 --> 00:00:54.166
And you know what?

18
00:00:54.166 --> 00:00:55.100
Join us today.

19
00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.533
They are all adults with heads and faces

20
00:00:57.533 --> 00:01:00.366
And you enter a draft competition

21
00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:02.800
The promotion qualification obtained by betraying others

22
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:03.966
You deserve it too.

23
00:01:03.966 --> 00:01:06.566
Chu Fan, did I make it very clear to you?

24
00:01:06.566 --> 00:01:07.766
Don't use my banner

25
00:01:07.766 --> 00:01:09.100
Do these disgusting things

26
00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:10.933
What's the use of you entering the shift inspection site?

27
00:01:10.933 --> 00:01:11.966
Still want to drag me down

28
00:01:11.966 --> 00:01:13.800
Ruin my good deeds at the ceremony

29
00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:18.166
Stop pretending, you've already received the message

30
00:01:18.166 --> 00:01:19.733
Know us Miss Jiang

31
00:01:19.733 --> 00:01:21.600
And she was nominated for best singer.

32
00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.466
So you want to ride on one's coattails with this

33
00:01:25.933 --> 00:01:28.200
Then congratulations in advance.

34
00:01:28.333 --> 00:01:30.700
It's kind of getting what you want.

35
00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.966
What are you pretending to be noble? Tell you Chu Fan.

36
00:01:32.966 --> 00:01:34.933
Miss Jiang was originally a singer

37
00:01:34.933 --> 00:01:36.500
If it weren't for your years of drag

38
00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:37.966
He's already a big hit

39
00:01:37.966 --> 00:01:38.733
So that's it.

40
00:01:38.733 --> 00:01:40.666
You two are not from the same world at all

41
00:01:40.666 --> 00:01:42.766
It's a pity that you can't see the situation clearly

42
00:01:42.966 --> 00:01:44.500
Is it a world?

43
00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:45.600
You don't have to say

44
00:01:46.766 --> 00:01:47.866
I have something else to do

45
00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.000
You really think of yourself as a character

46
00:01:51.366 --> 00:01:52.333
What is this place?

47
00:01:52.333 --> 00:01:53.700
Come and go when you want

48
00:01:54.133 --> 00:01:56.800
The awards ceremony is a grand event in the Chinese music scene

49
00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.566
For the safety of the audience and the actors

50
00:01:59.566 --> 00:02:02.500
Now please take out your admission ticket

51
00:02:02.933 --> 00:02:05.266
CEO get out of here

52
00:02:05.266 --> 00:02:07.033
I was invited.

53
00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:08.500
No admission ticket

54
00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:10.000
No

55
00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:12.600
No or no idea at all

56
00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.066
I haven't had time to fake it yet.

57
00:02:14.366 --> 00:02:16.900
Chu Fan, I told you a long time ago

58
00:02:17.066 --> 00:02:18.600
You are top-notch like us

59
00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.800
Not from the same world at all

60
00:02:20.866 --> 00:02:22.566
Chu Fan sees reality clearly

61
00:02:22.566 --> 00:02:24.566
This circle is not like you without eyes

62
00:02:24.566 --> 00:02:26.366
Short-sighted people can bring it in

63
00:02:26.366 --> 00:02:28.266
The rules of this industry

64
00:02:28.333 --> 00:02:29.800
People like you

65
00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.300
It can't be crossed in a lifetime

66
00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.200
Weather I said

67
00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.000
I was invited.

68
00:02:35.533 --> 00:02:36.766
Invitation only

69
00:02:37.133 --> 00:02:38.633
No admission

70
00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:44.300
The awards ceremony is the most prestigious event in the Chinese music scene

71
00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:46.100
Can come today

72
00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:49.100
But they are all big people with heads and faces

73
00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:53.033
Even they have to have papers to get in and out.

74
00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.100
As for the invitation letter?

75
00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.700
Except for that legendary singer back then, Fan

76
00:02:58.766 --> 00:03:01.000
Throughout the history of the Golden Melody Awards

77
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.700
No one deserves that invitation at all

78
00:03:03.766 --> 00:03:06.166
This time I'll see how you catch it

79
00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.066
How do you know I'm gone?

80
00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:10.766
Don't embarrass yourself here

81
00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.366
Listen to my sister's advice

82
00:03:12.366 --> 00:03:13.633
Be obedient

83
00:03:13.733 --> 00:03:15.833
Get out of here

84
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.700
Otherwise, wait for the security to come

85
00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:20.900
But not as polite as we are

86
00:03:21.133 --> 00:03:22.600
Chufan hurry up

87
00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.400
I want to raise awareness and get media companies to take a fancy to it

88
00:03:25.533 --> 00:03:26.900
There are other ways.

89
00:03:26.966 --> 00:03:28.600
Instead of like now

90
00:03:28.733 --> 00:03:31.900
Good at disrupting the order at the ceremony scene and throwing yourself away

91
00:03:32.166 --> 00:03:34.400
I don't need any fame

92
00:03:34.466 --> 00:03:36.533
As for the media companies you mentioned

93
00:03:36.533 --> 00:03:38.700
They just beg me to sign the contract

94
00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.200
Do you want to see the invitation letter?
