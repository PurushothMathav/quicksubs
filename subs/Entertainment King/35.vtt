00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:01.300
Hey sister

2
00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:03.366
Didn't they bring an open mouth to eat?

3
00:00:03.366 --> 00:00:05.333
Just his broken musical instrument, okay?

4
00:00:05.333 --> 00:00:06.933
It's hard to support yourself

5
00:00:06.933 --> 00:00:08.566
Sooner or later starve to death

6
00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:11.800
What are you doing?

7
00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:13.366
Xiaofan is his own family

8
00:00:13.366 --> 00:00:15.000
He's still your brother-in-law

9
00:00:15.133 --> 00:00:16.366
own family

10
00:00:16.866 --> 00:00:19.000
You don't know him yet, do you?

11
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.600
My brother-in-law is very wild now

12
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.766
Even my sister's career has to get involved

13
00:00:23.766 --> 00:00:25.733
Participate in the Tomorrow Execution Contest

14
00:00:25.733 --> 00:00:28.366
Ruin my sister's plan to return to the diva

15
00:00:28.366 --> 00:00:32.000
It made me lose millions of fans overnight

16
00:00:32.366 --> 00:00:35.400
What depends on Xiaorong to eat and drink for free?

17
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.966
It's okay if you don't help him with less career

18
00:00:37.966 --> 00:00:39.966
And drag him down

19
00:00:39.966 --> 00:00:41.800
Uncle, you don't know

20
00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.533
Originally, our Xiao Rong's career could have been further advanced

21
00:00:44.533 --> 00:00:46.533
Become the diva of the top Chinese

22
00:00:46.533 --> 00:00:48.266
It's because of this trash

23
00:00:48.266 --> 00:00:50.500
Let all these plans fall through

24
00:00:50.566 --> 00:00:53.366
Xiaofan, how could you do such a thing?

25
00:00:53.366 --> 00:00:54.766
I didn't do anything.

26
00:00:54.766 --> 00:00:55.900
Don't listen to our advice

27
00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:57.466
It wasn't you who participated in the competition?

28
00:00:57.466 --> 00:00:59.900
Mr. Chen's plan was not disrupted by you

29
00:00:59.966 --> 00:01:01.100
Don't dress here

30
00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:01.966
You're just afraid.

31
00:01:01.966 --> 00:01:04.566
Once our Miss Jiang becomes a top-tier diva

32
00:01:04.566 --> 00:01:07.500
With your status as a trash, the gap is too big

33
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:08.866
You don't deserve him

34
00:01:08.966 --> 00:01:10.800
Not worthy, isn't it?

35
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:14.066
For the past five years, you have eaten and drunk my sister's

36
00:01:14.066 --> 00:01:16.200
Even the rent that set sail on the broken moon

37
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.033
My sister paid for it for you.

38
00:01:18.066 --> 00:01:20.800
What do you pretend to be a master of music here all day?

39
00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.300
I really consider myself an outsider

40
00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:24.800
I'm kidding people who are decades old

41
00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.366
I don't know how to go back and pee

42
00:01:26.366 --> 00:01:29.066
Look in the mirror and see what kind of virtue you have

43
00:01:29.133 --> 00:01:31.966
Is this entertainment industry something you can do if you want?

44
00:01:31.966 --> 00:01:35.200
You are also worthy of my identity

45
00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.633
I know nothing.
