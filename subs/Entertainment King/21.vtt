00:00:00.533 --> 00:00:01.400
I would.

2
00:00:02.166 --> 00:00:05.166
Adult days, what wind has brought you here?

3
00:00:05.966 --> 00:00:08.000
Chen Ying, let me tell you

4
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.766
Don't come to me with these broken things again

5
00:00:10.766 --> 00:00:13.800
These things of yours simply don't meet the requirements.

6
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:15.000
You still

7
00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:17.600
Do it yourself

8
00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.700
It turns out that you have no energy to stay away these days.

9
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:01.700
Your more than 100 million fans blame him for doing it

10
00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:03.200
If he's willing to remind me

11
00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.700
I'm a cop too

12
00:01:05.333 --> 00:01:08.100
Chen Tianhao has directly invited you so many times.

13
00:01:08.266 --> 00:01:11.000
If I haven't met you for a while, today can be regarded as

14
00:01:12.266 --> 00:01:13.900
Hahahaha is very good.

15
00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:15.200
This game thing

16
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.800
I've connected with your agent, okay?

17
00:01:20.333 --> 00:01:21.733
Hahaha, how about these?

18
00:01:21.733 --> 00:01:24.700
It's a newcomer trained by my natural media gravity

19
00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.366
I hope you will follow

20
00:01:27.733 --> 00:01:30.066
Mr. Chu, I've been looking forward to working with you

21
00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:31.600
I don't know if I can show my face today

22
00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.100
Come on stage with me

23
00:01:33.666 --> 00:01:36.566
Miss Zeng, are you sure you want to invite this trash?

24
00:01:36.566 --> 00:01:38.566
Go on stage with you

25
00:01:42.866 --> 00:01:44.366
You were fired by me alone.

26
00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.200
An unscrupulous broker who relies on scum to return to his old business

27
00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.733
What's the difference with the boss?

28
00:01:48.733 --> 00:01:51.833
Just because you dare to scold Mr. Chu, do you deserve it?
