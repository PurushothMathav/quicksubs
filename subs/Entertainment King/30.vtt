1
00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:03.966
I announce the popularity ranking division of Chufan contestants

2
00:00:05.366 --> 00:00:07.433
Mr. Chen, his data has been rising

3
00:00:07.466 --> 00:00:08.600
He's number one again.

4
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:11.000
Suspend the ticket but

5
00:00:20.166 --> 00:00:22.900
He was ranked third.

6
00:00:23.566 --> 00:00:28.166
It's a pity that Chufan can only face being eliminated

7
00:00:29.333 --> 00:00:31.300
Absolutely impossible

8
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.433
Such a public stage dares to fake

9
00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:36.633
How brave

10
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.100
Rising Stars this round

11
00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.300
It was supposed to take advantage of the popularity of the contestants and judges

12
00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.300
canvass

13
00:00:43.366 --> 00:00:44.966
Punish him alone

14
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.333
Without anyone's help

15
00:00:47.333 --> 00:00:48.400
Stay in third place

16
00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.066
I would like to ask everyone here

17
00:00:50.066 --> 00:00:52.166
If the penalty grade is exchanged for you

18
00:00:52.166 --> 00:00:54.400
Has the defense been firmly established and commanded?

19
00:00:57.766 --> 00:00:59.500
It was Chu Fan who agreed

20
00:00:59.533 --> 00:01:02.766
Do you think that's fair now that you regret it?

21
00:01:03.266 --> 00:01:05.533
Before the game starts

22
00:01:05.533 --> 00:01:06.366
Program team

23
00:01:06.366 --> 00:01:08.700
In order to give Chu Fan a fair chance

24
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.833
Deliberately changed the rules of the game

25
00:01:10.866 --> 00:01:13.733
Let him decide for himself to restore the original environment

26
00:01:13.733 --> 00:01:16.900
You must win the first place to enter the next one

27
00:01:17.733 --> 00:01:19.800
Buddy, you don't want to fight terrorism

28
00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.100
Really unscrupulous

29
00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:25.266
It's a pity, what a pity

30
00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.866
Since this is the rule agreed by Chufan's players

31
00:01:28.866 --> 00:01:30.066
Then our wedding group

32
00:01:30.066 --> 00:01:32.266
Also announced according to the original rules

33
00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.366
Penalty elimination return

34
00:01:36.966 --> 00:01:37.766
return

35
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.433
The goods are back to normal.

36
00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.966
Who gave you the right to dare to eliminate him?
