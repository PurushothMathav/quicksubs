00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:02.200
I'm going to ask Huang An to deal with the problem.

2
00:00:02.366 --> 00:00:04.600
Chu Fan, you haven't realized the reality yet

3
00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:05.666
Do you think

4
00:00:05.666 --> 00:00:07.166
As long as you keep pretending

5
00:00:07.166 --> 00:00:09.133
Our Jiang family will continue to work hard

6
00:00:09.133 --> 00:00:10.433
Do you know

7
00:00:10.566 --> 00:00:12.366
You stand here unrepentant

8
00:00:12.366 --> 00:00:13.266
shameless

9
00:00:13.466 --> 00:00:15.066
Really ridiculous

10
00:00:15.133 --> 00:00:17.866
Brother-in-law, what do you mean by that?

11
00:00:18.466 --> 00:00:21.766
This black card is measured for you by Skylark International.

12
00:00:21.766 --> 00:00:23.000
Tailored

13
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.066
You bet it!

14
00:00:24.133 --> 00:00:27.000
Hahahaha ok

15
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.466
Since you want to play

16
00:00:28.466 --> 00:00:33.200
But I don't want to play with you to the end, come and swipe the card

17
00:00:37.366 --> 00:00:39.133
Sorry sir, you don't need to think about it.

18
00:00:39.133 --> 00:00:40.733
Hahahaha

19
00:00:40.733 --> 00:00:42.466
Did you hear that?

20
00:00:42.466 --> 00:00:44.666
Your tailor-made card

21
00:00:44.666 --> 00:00:46.700
Why can't people recognize it?

22
00:00:47.133 --> 00:00:48.666
His authority is not enough

23
00:00:49.066 --> 00:00:50.333
Call your supervisor over

24
00:00:50.333 --> 00:00:51.733
Take it with his poison

25
00:00:51.733 --> 00:00:53.466
Chu Fan, when are you going to make trouble?

26
00:00:53.466 --> 00:00:55.166
You're still not ashamed enough to be here, are you?

27
00:00:55.166 --> 00:00:56.800
I just told you.

28
00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.333
As long as you bow your head and admit your mistake

29
00:00:58.333 --> 00:00:59.666
Our Jiang family will not pass

30
00:00:59.666 --> 00:01:01.300
But why do you insist on going your own way?

31
00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.200
Make things impossible

32
00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.966
I'm going my own way

33
00:01:04.966 --> 00:01:06.100
Isn't it?

34
00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:06.900
Oh brother-in-law

35
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.966
You said we were here today

36
00:01:08.966 --> 00:01:12.866
Then do I have to have a drink with him?

37
00:01:13.933 --> 00:01:16.666
That's right, come on

38
00:01:18.166 --> 00:01:21.700
Brother-in-law, I have to toast you with this cup.

39
00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:22.700
Ah!

40
00:01:23.266 --> 00:01:27.266
Hahaha, this bottle of wine is worth millions.

41
00:01:27.266 --> 00:01:28.700
I don't think you can afford it either.

42
00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.766
But this table of dishes

43
00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.100
I'd like to watch it today

44
00:01:33.666 --> 00:01:35.400
You can afford it.

45
00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.500
I'll help him get up
