00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:03.900
Xu always speaks to Mr. Blessing

2
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:05.566
Don't get me wrong.

3
00:00:05.566 --> 00:00:07.766
I have no hostility towards you

4
00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:09.833
It's just that

5
00:00:10.166 --> 00:00:11.566
Some high-level things

6
00:00:11.566 --> 00:00:13.900
It's not something your little character can participate in.

7
00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:15.466
Pay attention to your identity

8
00:00:15.666 --> 00:00:16.466
high-rise

9
00:00:16.666 --> 00:00:19.566
I don't know how you contacted Miss Yun

10
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.866
But I would urge you to recognize your position

11
00:00:22.866 --> 00:00:24.566
See your own strength

12
00:00:24.566 --> 00:00:27.433
If you let me know about you and my fiancÃ©e again

13
00:00:27.533 --> 00:00:28.866
If there are too many connections

14
00:00:28.866 --> 00:00:29.866
Mr. Nachu

15
00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.866
You should pay attention to your physical safety.

16
00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:34.933
Mr. Xu, I also ask you to recognize yourself

17
00:00:34.933 --> 00:00:36.000
This is in the country.

18
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.733
If your dirty tricks don't work

19
00:00:38.733 --> 00:00:41.866
In addition, don't forget that both sides of the strait have to pay

20
00:00:41.866 --> 00:00:43.566
Did your prodigal start 5 years ago?

21
00:00:43.733 --> 00:00:44.800
Want to do it again?

22
00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.600
Let's go, Mr. Xu is deaf talking to you

23
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.200
Others pity him

24
00:00:53.466 --> 00:00:55.400
I've seen a lot of people like him.

25
00:00:55.933 --> 00:00:58.100
Chu Fan's status determines his vision

26
00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:59.900
Little people like you

27
00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:03.500
You will never know where the gap in strength lies

28
00:01:04.866 --> 00:01:06.900
As the highest ceremony in the Chinese music scene

29
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.366
This year's Golden Melody Awards

30
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:09.600
Best Singer

31
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.700
It is the first stop for our global entertainment to enter the domestic market

32
00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.366
Our global entertainment will also be a must

33
00:01:17.966 --> 00:01:19.066
As for where

34
00:01:19.766 --> 00:01:20.600
I told you the truth

35
00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:21.966
Where can I pay again

36
00:01:21.966 --> 00:01:24.600
It all depends on the age of our global entertainment

37
00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.000
Our global entertainment will cooperate in depth with
