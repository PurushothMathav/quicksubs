Golden Melody Award for Best Singer

3
00:00:06.133 --> 00:00:08.733
It's always been for popular artists

4
00:00:08.733 --> 00:00:10.100
top prize

5
00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:11.500
With this award

6
00:00:11.566 --> 00:00:14.533
He arranges all the announcements and performances

7
00:00:14.533 --> 00:00:15.333
royal city

8
00:00:16.166 --> 00:00:17.966
It will also gain fame and fortune

9
00:00:18.066 --> 00:00:20.566
The capital operation behind the Golden Melody Awards

10
00:00:20.566 --> 00:00:22.733
Aren't they all from Skylark International?

11
00:00:22.733 --> 00:00:25.800
Mr. Chen, we are going to Luo Fu's birthday party today

12
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.166
I don't know what means to punish that waste

13
00:00:28.166 --> 00:00:31.066
He actually invited Mr. Yun, the president of Skylark International

14
00:00:32.066 --> 00:00:35.466
He seems to have a problem with our Miss Jiang

15
00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.766
The cloud is always today, and this cloud always helps to break it down

16
00:00:39.933 --> 00:00:42.466
And he seems to take punishment seriously

17
00:00:42.466 --> 00:00:43.866
Also invited him to participate in the cloud area

18
00:00:43.866 --> 00:00:45.566
International treatment of the highest standard

19
00:00:47.733 --> 00:00:48.533
Hey

20
00:00:49.166 --> 00:00:51.166
What is the cloud's identity and status?

21
00:00:51.166 --> 00:00:53.900
How could you invite an anonymous person into the room?

22
00:00:54.566 --> 00:00:57.166
Not to mention this Skylark Hotel

23
00:00:57.166 --> 00:00:58.366
That's the first surrender in the country

24
00:00:58.366 --> 00:01:00.166
One Finger's Premium Private Club

25
00:01:00.166 --> 00:01:02.466
If the two of them are really related

26
00:01:02.533 --> 00:01:06.200
Then why didn't this Mr. Yun personally send him to the casino?

27
00:01:08.766 --> 00:01:11.300
You still don't understand this crap

28
00:01:11.533 --> 00:01:14.566
He must be borrowing Rou Ao's identity and status

29
00:01:14.566 --> 00:01:16.033
This is the tiger's pass

30
00:01:16.066 --> 00:01:18.766
I don't know where I got these actors

31
00:01:18.766 --> 00:01:19.933
Cooperate with him in acting

32
00:01:19.933 --> 00:01:22.166
Hey, put gold on your face?

33
00:01:22.166 --> 00:01:23.300
So I told you.

34
00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:26.000
How could that trash be a big shot?

35
00:01:26.533 --> 00:01:29.966
It's still our Mr. Chen who has knowledge

36
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.766
Yu He went to a cocktail party

37
00:01:34.966 --> 00:01:36.700
Let me introduce you to Global Entertainment

38
00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.000
Xu Laotian, President of the company in Asia

39
00:01:39.566 --> 00:01:42.500
It's an internationally renowned media giant

40
00:01:42.733 --> 00:01:44.800
It is said that Xingyue International

41
00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:47.200
The reason why it can occupy the top position in the country

42
00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.033
It's because of Mr. Xu's football

43
00:01:49.166 --> 00:01:51.533
Everything within is transferred to the logical market

44
00:01:51.533 --> 00:01:53.833
So I gave Xinyue them a chance

45
00:01:53.866 --> 00:01:57.300
Global entertainment is now poised to enter the domestic market

46
00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.333
To build a relationship with Mr. Xu

47
00:01:59.333 --> 00:02:01.900
Even if it's a bad dragon dance

48
00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:03.900
Can be promoted to the top position by him

49
00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:05.033
There he is.

50
00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.100
You can make your dreams come true

51
00:02:09.266 --> 00:02:11.433
Then no thanks to Mr. Chen.

52
00:02:11.466 --> 00:02:13.200
Hey Rong'er

53
00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.433
Why are you being polite to me at this time?
