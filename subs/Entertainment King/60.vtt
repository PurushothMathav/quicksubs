00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:01.733
You see the price clearly

2
00:00:01.733 --> 00:00:03.666
I'm not alone in rejecting you

3
00:00:03.666 --> 00:00:04.500
What it boils down to?

4
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:05.733
But it's who you are

5
00:00:05.733 --> 00:00:07.666
The status gap is too great

6
00:00:07.666 --> 00:00:09.333
You don't deserve to be here

7
00:00:09.333 --> 00:00:10.200
I told you.

8
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.366
Mr. Chu represents our Crescent Company

9
00:00:12.366 --> 00:00:14.133
The identity and status of Xu Xinyue's company

10
00:00:14.133 --> 00:00:15.133
Don't you deserve it?

11
00:00:15.133 --> 00:00:16.533
Don't be angry

12
00:00:16.533 --> 00:00:19.200
I'm just teaching him to see his body

13
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.500
By the way, teach him some reason

14
00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:22.300
customer

15
00:00:23.266 --> 00:00:25.266
Mr. Xu, if you let me out

16
00:00:25.266 --> 00:00:27.466
This price is really urgent

17
00:00:27.466 --> 00:00:28.266
Hahaha

18
00:00:28.266 --> 00:00:31.366
What are you, you are also entitled to

19
00:00:31.366 --> 00:00:33.900
Xu Le, President of Asia, Our Global Entertainment Company

20
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:34.766
I can't stand it.

21
00:00:34.766 --> 00:00:35.800
I'm standing here today.

22
00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.933
It represents the global entertainment market in Asia

23
00:00:37.933 --> 00:00:39.066
Entertainment leader in the district

24
00:00:39.066 --> 00:00:41.800
There are very few people in the audience with a body like mine

25
00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.100
I'd like to know what kind of treatment you receive

26
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.266
I can't afford it.

27
00:00:45.266 --> 00:00:47.866
Or the Tianwang Diva who is here today?

28
00:00:47.866 --> 00:00:49.266
Should be trampled under your feet

29
00:00:49.266 --> 00:00:52.300
You are the brightest top star in my life

30
00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:54.700
That's right, you guys put it together.

31
00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:56.433
Can't compare to me

32
00:00:58.666 --> 00:01:01.600
Mr. Chen, you have to think carefully

33
00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.766
If you care about protecting this trash

34
00:01:03.766 --> 00:01:05.700
For you, New Moon Media

35
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.066
I'll be a rich man

36
00:01:08.166 --> 00:01:09.200
Here today.

37
00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.866
But they are all first-class in our country

38
00:01:12.266 --> 00:01:13.800
It's the least popular.

39
00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.766
He is also an old-timer of our Huaye music scene

40
00:01:15.766 --> 00:01:17.266
Once upon a time, ah

41
00:01:17.266 --> 00:01:21.000
You are an unknown person who has not even made a debut

42
00:01:21.166 --> 00:01:24.600
What is it up to him to talk nonsense here?

43
00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.066
I myself am the greatest universe

44
00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:27.966
I'd like to see it

45
00:01:27.966 --> 00:01:30.000
Are you a superstar on top?

46
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.566
Or a gasp for dust?

47
00:01:36.266 --> 00:01:39.566
Just get out of my way and go to be presumptuous Xu Ruotian
