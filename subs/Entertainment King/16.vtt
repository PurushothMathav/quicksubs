00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.166
Not this masked singer

2
00:00:02.166 --> 00:00:03.266
Is it the most zhugata?

3
00:00:03.266 --> 00:00:05.866
Hey, even if it's a masked singer

4
00:00:05.866 --> 00:00:09.166
That's Mr. Chen's friend too, right?

5
00:00:20.866 --> 00:00:22.066
Mr. Chen

6
00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:25.166
I still have to bother you

7
00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:33.033
Mr. Chen, please bother you more from now on.

8
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.833
OK, don't worry.

9
00:00:34.933 --> 00:00:38.766
Punishing him is nothing more than luck and guilt

10
00:00:45.133 --> 00:00:46.633
I'm getting more and more angry

11
00:00:46.866 --> 00:00:48.466
Of course.

12
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.400
Oh, I went in too, it rained.

13
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:51.500
I saw you on the last show

14
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:52.733
Good singing after ordinary

15
00:00:52.733 --> 00:00:55.433
Thank you little brother, who learned it for you?

16
00:00:55.466 --> 00:00:56.566
Myself

17
00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.366
You were also an original musician before

18
00:01:00.366 --> 00:01:02.666
I sell musical instruments

19
00:01:04.333 --> 00:01:05.200
Ha ha.

20
00:01:06.333 --> 00:01:09.800
A third-rate singer dares to say that he wrote his own song
