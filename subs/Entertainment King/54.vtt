00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.833
Are you a fan?

2
00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:05.100
Chufan, are you crazy?

3
00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.300
You know the opinion crowd today

4
00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:09.333
How many of them were singers?

5
00:00:09.333 --> 00:00:11.100
Loyal fans of Liafan

6
00:00:11.166 --> 00:00:12.866
In front of these people

7
00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.366
Pretending to be their puppet in public

8
00:00:16.366 --> 00:00:19.500
Do you still want to get married in music?

9
00:00:20.266 --> 00:00:21.966
Unknown thing

10
00:00:21.966 --> 00:00:23.766
The top gifters behind the Golden Melody Awards

11
00:00:23.766 --> 00:00:25.500
It's the cloud of Skylark International

12
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.500
He's Fan's biggest fan.

13
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:28.933
If only he knew

14
00:00:28.933 --> 00:00:31.566
You are here pretending to be his most sacred idol

15
00:00:31.566 --> 00:00:33.000
Then you're dead.

16
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.400
Who am I?

17
00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.866
It's not something you can decide with a single sentence

18
00:00:39.133 --> 00:00:40.533
I'm going to the ceremony

19
00:00:40.533 --> 00:00:41.900
Get out of the way and stop

20
00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.333
You don't think you want to run now

21
00:00:43.333 --> 00:00:44.266
Is it too late?

22
00:00:44.266 --> 00:00:45.700
We don't know you.

23
00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:47.566
Doesn't Miss Jiang know you either?

24
00:00:47.566 --> 00:00:48.966
5 years of marriage

25
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.300
With the essence of being a wimp

26
00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.366
It has long been exposed in front of him

27
00:00:52.366 --> 00:00:53.233
you

28
00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:55.333
I think so too

29
00:00:55.333 --> 00:00:57.666
I know you've always wanted to do something

30
00:00:57.666 --> 00:00:59.866
I hope you will be like a man in my heart

31
00:00:59.933 --> 00:01:01.466
But your impractical

32
00:01:01.466 --> 00:01:04.100
The thought of daydreaming just makes me feel cheap

33
00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:05.166
Chop out the door

34
00:01:05.166 --> 00:01:06.466
Stop pretending

35
00:01:06.466 --> 00:01:09.166
Mr. Chen has given you many opportunities

36
00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.433
Ok next time

37
00:01:12.666 --> 00:01:13.500
I fell

38
00:01:14.466 --> 00:01:15.966
What I said is true.

39
00:01:15.966 --> 00:01:18.600
I don't have to choose with anyone

40
00:01:18.733 --> 00:01:20.766
Okay, fake is fake.

41
00:01:20.766 --> 00:01:22.866
It's useless to say more.

42
00:01:22.866 --> 00:01:25.533
You're not even qualified to be here at all

43
00:01:25.533 --> 00:01:27.200
Stay here and don't want to go

44
00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:28.400
Then I'll help you.

45
00:01:29.366 --> 00:01:30.200
Come

46
00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.600
This person trespassed on the ceremony

47
00:01:33.733 --> 00:01:35.166
blatant fraud

48
00:01:35.533 --> 00:01:37.366
Send him out to me

49
00:01:38.333 --> 00:01:39.866
You guys are so brave

50
00:01:39.866 --> 00:01:41.433
Sexy threat Mr. Chu
