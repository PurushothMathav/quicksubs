00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:01.866
What do you mean lost?

2
00:00:01.866 --> 00:00:03.900
You are such an ambitious fat man

3
00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:06.900
You know these top singers here

4
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:08.666
How many of you have received a song?

5
00:00:08.666 --> 00:00:10.466
Any advice and help?

6
00:00:10.466 --> 00:00:13.100
You dare to report that mysterious song again

7
00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:14.200
Are you really not going to

8
00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:15.800
In this music world

9
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.233
Impersonation is not necessary at all

10
00:00:18.566 --> 00:00:20.766
Others can but you can't

11
00:00:21.133 --> 00:00:22.600
I heard that you, Miss Gejiang

12
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.966
But they know each other

13
00:00:24.966 --> 00:00:27.700
I'd like to know where you got these from

14
00:00:27.866 --> 00:00:29.133
He is impossible

15
00:00:29.133 --> 00:00:30.966
Chu Fan, stop acting

16
00:00:30.966 --> 00:00:32.900
Your identity has to be exposed by us

17
00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:36.266
Do you have to kiss your face in front of everyone?

18
00:00:36.366 --> 00:00:36.966
OK

19
00:00:36.966 --> 00:00:39.966
He's just a trash who can only write a few broken songs

20
00:00:39.966 --> 00:00:42.800
The owner of a run-down music store

21
00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.700
Before the Rising Stars game

22
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.600
He has never set foot in the entertainment industry

23
00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.500
A loser who only relies on women for soft food

24
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.300
Pan Shanglinzi

25
00:00:51.333 --> 00:00:54.300
And Mr. Chen of Xinyue Group supports you

26
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.533
Now I want to step on Xu Shaozhan again

27
00:00:57.533 --> 00:00:58.366
I'll tell you what.

28
00:00:58.366 --> 00:00:59.966
You got the wrong person

29
00:00:59.966 --> 00:01:02.333
Pretend this is a cut rope, van

30
00:01:02.333 --> 00:01:05.000
Get rid of the waste that ruins other people's fertility

31
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.900
I see who dares

32
00:01:11.133 --> 00:01:13.400
Mr. Lin, you must be responsible for this responsibility

33
00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:14.966
Global failure is approaching

34
00:01:14.966 --> 00:01:16.800
There are no more popular meals in previous years

35
00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.466
Do you still want to rely on this waste to save the decline?

36
00:01:19.466 --> 00:01:21.100
Put China on top of him

37
00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:22.200
You're kidding me!

38
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.266
How about today?

39
00:01:23.266 --> 00:01:26.066
Just use this kind of singing to announce one thing

40
00:01:26.366 --> 00:01:29.266
Our global entertainment has officially counted seconds

41
00:01:29.266 --> 00:01:30.300
Pull it out

42
00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:31.266
In the next 10 years

43
00:01:31.266 --> 00:01:33.666
He will be a signed singer for our global entertainment

44
00:01:33.666 --> 00:01:35.066
And gold medal autobiography

45
00:01:35.133 --> 00:01:37.000
Ladies and gentlemen, our global entertainment

46
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.633
But a big circle of love

47
00:01:38.733 --> 00:01:40.933
As long as you are talented singers

48
00:01:40.933 --> 00:01:43.000
Our platform will definitely give it to you.

49
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.500
Offer a better opportunity

50
00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.866
But anyone who signs up at Yuncun International

51
00:01:47.866 --> 00:01:50.800
This is the enemy of our global entertainment industry.

52
00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:52.733
Mr. Lin, have you thought it through?

53
00:01:52.733 --> 00:01:54.000
Do you want to continue to protect

54
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.600
This trash is still here for me
