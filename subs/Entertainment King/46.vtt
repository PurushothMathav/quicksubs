1
00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:03.166
I'm really busy with Mr. Chu

2
00:00:03.166 --> 00:00:04.600
I came to see you today.

3
00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:06.166
I just want to ask Mr. Chu

4
00:00:06.166 --> 00:00:07.966
Is there a contracted brokerage company?

5
00:00:07.966 --> 00:00:10.200
There are currently no plans to sign a contract.

6
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.533
I'm a Rising Star draft after all

7
00:00:12.533 --> 00:00:15.366
If you want to sign, it should also be a new product special.

8
00:00:15.366 --> 00:00:17.233
If Mr. Chu has a job change

9
00:00:17.533 --> 00:00:19.700
Isn't it on the crescent moon?

10
00:00:19.766 --> 00:00:20.900
As far as I know

11
00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:24.066
Skylark International is a big capital in the entertainment industry

12
00:00:24.066 --> 00:00:26.400
The star held by Mr. Yun

13
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.200
Red Huaxia half-face sticker

14
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.266
So kind to me as a newcomer

15
00:00:31.266 --> 00:00:32.066
I'm afraid so.

16
00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:33.966
Something else?

17
00:00:33.966 --> 00:00:36.766
I don't know if Mr. Chu has heard of Global Entertainment

18
00:00:36.766 --> 00:00:38.666
Heard that their Asian head

19
00:00:38.666 --> 00:00:41.800
It was the Xu family who was all-powerful in the entertainment industry back then

20
00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:42.700
Nice

21
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.366
Global Entertainment wanted to enter the domestic market a few years ago

22
00:00:46.366 --> 00:00:47.966
He was the masked singer

23
00:00:47.966 --> 00:00:50.933
Collaborate with major domestic media companies

24
00:00:50.933 --> 00:00:53.033
Just beat them back, they want to be in the country

25
00:00:53.066 --> 00:00:53.933
Operating enterprise

26
00:00:53.933 --> 00:00:55.466
Now they're back.

27
00:00:55.466 --> 00:00:57.100
If they enter the domestic market

28
00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.833
Then I, Skylark International, will not be an opponent.

29
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.100
I'm afraid Mr. Lin still has something to hide

30
00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.800
Global entertainment has a huge amount of money

31
00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:13.000
International status is of great significance

32
00:01:13.066 --> 00:01:16.000
But Mr. Yun is not a media company after all

33
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.266
As the capital of the entertainment industry

34
00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.466
Want to invest in global entertainment

35
00:01:20.466 --> 00:01:22.233
It's not that difficult

36
00:01:23.733 --> 00:01:26.300
There was another reason, of course.

37
00:01:27.066 --> 00:01:30.000
I had a bet with the Xu family a few years ago

38
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.533
If I were Skylark International

39
00:01:31.533 --> 00:01:33.866
Can't stop them from entering the corner of the country

40
00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.266
I want to marry Xu Ruotian

41
00:01:35.266 --> 00:01:36.833
With Skylark International

42
00:01:36.866 --> 00:01:38.566
Include the assets of his Xu family together

43
00:01:38.566 --> 00:01:41.266
It's just me. It doesn't matter.

44
00:01:41.333 --> 00:01:43.700
The brokerage company that Miss Jiang is now contracted with

45
00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.000
The shareholder behind it appears to be Chen Tianhao

46
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.966
But the person who really controls Miss Jiang's fate

47
00:01:47.966 --> 00:01:48.833
More hypocritical

48
00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:50.466
That's him!
