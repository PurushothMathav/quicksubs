00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:02.000
Mr. Xu

2
00:00:03.566 --> 00:00:05.066
Tonight the media is in the country

3
00:00:05.066 --> 00:00:06.533
He can't cover the sky with one hand

4
00:00:06.533 --> 00:00:08.466
Mr. Chen, let me introduce to you

5
00:00:08.466 --> 00:00:11.200
President of Global Entertainment Asia

6
00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.100
Xu Ruotian Xu Sheng

7
00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:14.300
I heard that the Xu family on the street

8
00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:16.133
Just got a music agency in Asia

9
00:00:16.133 --> 00:00:17.833
The permission is called Xu Yue

10
00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:19.666
That's right, that's him.

11
00:00:19.666 --> 00:00:21.766
The Xu family's influence spreads throughout the entertainment industry

12
00:00:21.766 --> 00:00:23.500
If you can take refuge in the Xu family

13
00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:26.100
Even a lowly Internet celebrity

14
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:27.600
Can be held by him

15
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:28.833
Top position

16
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.900
Mr. Xu, haven't you always looked down on the Golden Melody Award?

17
00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:33.600
This kind of ceremony without gold content

18
00:00:33.766 --> 00:00:35.900
How to talk to yourself about your worth today

19
00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.966
Isn't Mr. Chen in the same mind as me?

20
00:00:38.966 --> 00:00:40.000
Everybody knows that.

21
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.800
Rising Stars and Golden Melody Awards

22
00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.800
Hooked masked song god

23
00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.366
Who wants to be in the finals of the Rising Stars

24
00:00:46.366 --> 00:00:47.666
Announcement of comeback

25
00:00:47.666 --> 00:00:49.666
You know that.

26
00:00:49.666 --> 00:00:51.100
If you don't come

27
00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:53.600
Where is the opportunity to meet a legendary person?

28
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:55.700
annoying

29
00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.133
You look familiar.

30
00:00:58.133 --> 00:00:59.400
You're welcome.

31
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.900
How could I know someone like you?

32
00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:04.166
Hufan Beijing Conservatory of Music

33
00:01:04.166 --> 00:01:07.100
Internet celebrity Jiang Ge who happened to meet during college

34
00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:08.200
Love at first sight

35
00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.566
Made a few broken songs

36
00:01:09.566 --> 00:01:11.300
To give him the opportunity to enter the Chinese language

37
00:01:11.733 --> 00:01:13.266
Including so far

38
00:01:13.266 --> 00:01:16.666
Jiang Lang withdrew from the English word in dismay

39
00:01:16.666 --> 00:01:18.533
And made some loud jumps and set sail.

40
00:01:18.533 --> 00:01:20.800
Your identity is really not sure
