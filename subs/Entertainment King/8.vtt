00:00:06.133 --> 00:00:07.166
I used to

2
00:00:08.066 --> 00:00:09.466
Can't let go of everything

3
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.700
I just hope that others will tell you a safe life.

4
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.766
On this stage today

5
00:00:14.766 --> 00:00:16.100
I want to tell you

6
00:00:16.133 --> 00:00:19.066
This heart has no regrets in this life

7
00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.700
A pair of traitors

8
00:00:28.166 --> 00:00:28.900
Hey

9
00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:32.233
Chen Chen Chen is always the bench you asked you to put him on

10
00:00:32.266 --> 00:00:35.366
No, it wasn't my idea to move away.

11
00:00:36.133 --> 00:00:37.733
This is coming soon.

12
00:00:37.733 --> 00:00:39.300
Just need his game results

13
00:00:45.366 --> 00:00:47.666
Great performance by the final contestants

14
00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.500
Liu Zixin this song

15
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.500
And there's no turning around of your mind teacher.

16
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.033
So the results

17
00:00:53.466 --> 00:00:55.633
Vote voting we look at the data

18
00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:57.866
step back step back

19
00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:59.900
step back step back step back

20
00:00:59.966 --> 00:01:01.633
step back step back

21
00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:04.533
Everyone be quiet

22
00:01:04.533 --> 00:01:05.766
Just be quiet.

23
00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:07.466
The requirements for my marriage

24
00:01:07.466 --> 00:01:10.300
The president of our show calculated the data of the contestants

25
00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.000
According to the rules of the show

26
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.466
Only those who reach 1 million votes can make progress

27
00:01:15.466 --> 00:01:18.700
The next step is our final success

28
00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.966
950,000 tickets. How is that possible?

29
00:01:22.966 --> 00:01:23.733
Is there shady?

30
00:01:23.733 --> 00:01:25.533
This is fraud

31
00:01:25.533 --> 00:01:26.600
malicious

32
00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.133
This shit in the entertainment industry

33
00:01:28.133 --> 00:01:30.133
It can be regarded as letting you understand for us.

34
00:01:30.133 --> 00:01:32.133
Too bad you don't understand

35
00:01:32.133 --> 00:01:34.733
The entertainment industry relies on capital and strength

36
00:01:34.733 --> 00:01:37.633
Capital can suppress talent

37
00:01:37.933 --> 00:01:39.266
It's really a pity.

38
00:01:39.266 --> 00:01:41.266
The contestant's score is invalid

39
00:01:41.266 --> 00:01:42.500
Change data

40
00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:43.600
cheat

41
00:01:43.866 --> 00:01:45.433
So brave
