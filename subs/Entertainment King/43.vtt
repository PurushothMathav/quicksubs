1
00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.166
president

2
00:00:02.666 --> 00:00:04.866
You are the cloud manager of Skylark International

3
00:00:06.266 --> 00:00:07.433
So I heard.

4
00:00:07.533 --> 00:00:10.533
Skylark International is half of the country's happy talk

5
00:00:10.533 --> 00:00:12.333
Almost half of the newcomers

6
00:00:12.333 --> 00:00:14.800
It all relies on the connections and resources of Skylark International

7
00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:16.000
Get a foothold in town

8
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.266
Foreshadows all capital shipping costs behind the full

9
00:00:18.366 --> 00:00:21.300
Almost all of them were created by the CEO of Skylark International

10
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.366
I didn't expect it to be a woman

11
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:24.800
As far as I know

12
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.433
She was once under the guidance of the masked singing god

13
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:28.966
Worked in the entertainment industry

14
00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:31.600
Later, with the help of the masked song god

15
00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:32.900
Open up various channels

16
00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.166
So there is the thoughtfulness of Skylark International

17
00:00:35.166 --> 00:00:36.233
Notify

18
00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.100
In the future, all the industries under my Skylark Group

19
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:40.966
Just save money first to spend

20
00:00:40.966 --> 00:00:42.433
I will pay for it all

21
00:00:43.366 --> 00:00:46.833
It's a kind of smile to my idol

22
00:00:50.133 --> 00:00:51.966
Chief Inspector, are you mistaken?

23
00:00:51.966 --> 00:00:54.966
He's just a piece of crap selling musical instruments

24
00:00:57.466 --> 00:00:59.400
You are Jiang Rujiang Diva, right?

25
00:01:00.966 --> 00:01:02.100
Hello Mr. Lin

26
00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.200
Nice to meet you.

27
00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:06.033
You can't live if you know each other, but I have to advise you

28
00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:08.300
If you want to take your career to the next level

29
00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:09.300
I suggest you change the season.

30
00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:10.600
Pardon me?

31
00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:11.733
What cloud manager

32
00:01:11.733 --> 00:01:14.166
The president who treats a waste as an idol

33
00:01:14.166 --> 00:01:15.800
It's the first time I've seen it.

34
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.266
Maybe.

35
00:01:17.266 --> 00:01:19.966
It's this trash who paid a bitch

36
00:01:19.966 --> 00:01:22.000
Are you putting on airs here?

37
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:22.933
One more word.

38
00:01:22.933 --> 00:01:25.266
I let you not get out of this today.

39
00:01:25.733 --> 00:01:27.566
Mr. Zhou further

40
00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:29.600
And so forth.
