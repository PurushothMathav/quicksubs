1
00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:01.300
Get out of your wish

2
00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:05.266
Take control of all achievements

3
00:00:05.366 --> 00:00:08.566
It doesn't seem to have reached the point where one hand covers the sky

4
00:00:08.566 --> 00:00:12.233
I said you can't hide your talent

5
00:00:21.766 --> 00:00:22.800
Miss Jiang

6
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.900
I heard you want to rejoin my show

7
00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:27.033
Dividend again

8
00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.000
Mr. Wang

9
00:00:28.066 --> 00:00:30.900
On behalf of Crescent Company, I solemnly inform you

10
00:00:31.133 --> 00:00:32.233
Rising Star

11
00:00:32.266 --> 00:00:35.400
It is a fair stage for talented people to enjoy music

12
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.266
It's not for you to operate with dark incense.

13
00:00:37.266 --> 00:00:38.866
The place for malicious hype

14
00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.366
Mr. Tang, since there is no dark incense operation here

15
00:00:42.466 --> 00:00:43.966
Then I would like to ask

16
00:00:43.966 --> 00:00:45.533
Why some achieve nothing

17
00:00:45.533 --> 00:00:48.066
People with no talent will be invited to the show

18
00:00:49.766 --> 00:00:51.400
He can get married

19
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:55.300
Is this the justice and fairness that Mr. Wang said?

20
00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.966
You have no idea who he is.

21
00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.700
See you off and get married

22
00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:03.300
I know what kind of person he is better than you

23
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.100
Mr. Wang

24
00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:05.966
I just wanted to remind you kindly

25
00:01:05.966 --> 00:01:07.166
Don't be deceived by some people

26
00:01:07.166 --> 00:01:08.100
Don't quit

27
00:01:08.366 --> 00:01:10.200
Sister Qing, come with us
