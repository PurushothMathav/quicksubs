1
00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:02.666
You really put gold on your face

2
00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:06.266
Chu Fan, don't think you have reported to President Wang's minister

3
00:00:06.266 --> 00:00:07.600
You can get through it again

4
00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:10.066
This performance is not under the jurisdiction of Crescent Company

5
00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:12.066
Everything is paid by Mr. Chen

6
00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:14.433
Didn't he resign?

7
00:00:15.333 --> 00:00:16.733
Mr. Chen is in this industry

8
00:00:16.733 --> 00:00:18.533
One of the best producers of gold

9
00:00:18.533 --> 00:00:20.900
I teamed up with Xingyue Media before

10
00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:22.366
Only today is the star and moon

11
00:00:22.366 --> 00:00:24.000
Now Mr. Chen has left

12
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.066
Naturally, he went back to his own company.

13
00:00:26.066 --> 00:00:27.000
So what?

14
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.466
Can he cover the sky with one hand?

15
00:00:28.466 --> 00:00:30.266
This is my talent surnamed Chen.

16
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.400
Isn't that enough to control everything?

17
00:00:33.933 --> 00:00:34.733
Arrange

18
00:00:34.733 --> 00:00:37.400
Let the other two judges choose another contestant

19
00:00:38.166 --> 00:00:40.300
Mr. Chu sings alone

20
00:00:41.166 --> 00:00:43.066
Then don't bother Mr. Chen to arrange it.

21
00:00:43.066 --> 00:00:47.366
I can be alone, but you can be alone.

22
00:00:47.366 --> 00:00:48.300
This competition

23
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.333
It is the contestants who take advantage of the judges' singing status

24
00:00:50.333 --> 00:00:51.200
Come for yourself

25
00:00:51.266 --> 00:00:53.533
To put it bluntly, which judge has the most fans?

26
00:00:53.533 --> 00:00:55.900
Help the contestant take 50 billion video

27
00:00:56.666 --> 00:00:58.600
You can't beat us
