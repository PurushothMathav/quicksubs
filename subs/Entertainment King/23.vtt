00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:02.100
Don't worry about Lawson

2
00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:03.366
No matter what the outcome

3
00:00:03.366 --> 00:00:06.266
To be able to meet a talented and talented person

4
00:00:06.366 --> 00:00:08.766
It is my greatest wish in Chen Yao's life

5
00:00:09.866 --> 00:00:12.266
Everyone wishes Chen Tianhao

6
00:00:14.733 --> 00:00:16.766
Miss Chen, I advise you

7
00:00:16.766 --> 00:00:18.700
Don't be condemned by those who are incompetent

8
00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:20.400
You don't lie with rhetoric

9
00:00:20.666 --> 00:00:23.666
I know what kind of person he is better than you

10
00:00:24.733 --> 00:00:26.400
I spent a year with him day and night

11
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.566
From start to finish

12
00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.666
He's just a jerk waiting to die

13
00:00:29.666 --> 00:00:31.500
The nonsense that only hides behind women

14
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.000
I just hope Miss Chen chooses you too

15
00:00:34.066 --> 00:00:35.133
The difficulty of doing

16
00:00:35.133 --> 00:00:36.266
Thanks for reminding

17
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.233
Mr. Chu, let's talk about it inside

18
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.066
The song that Mr. Chu sang in the last competition was very nice

19
00:00:50.166 --> 00:00:51.433
I like it very much.

20
00:00:51.766 --> 00:00:53.266
I am your fan.

21
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.400
Could you please sign my name?

22
00:00:57.866 --> 00:00:58.966
Miss Chen is welcome.

23
00:00:58.966 --> 00:01:00.300
I just don't get it.

24
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.333
So many potential singers on the scene

25
00:01:02.333 --> 00:01:04.000
Why did you choose me?

26
00:01:04.133 --> 00:01:06.066
Mr. Chu's An Ordinary Road

27
00:01:06.133 --> 00:01:07.466
Touched the hearts of countless people

28
00:01:07.466 --> 00:01:09.933
I greatly appreciate your talents and talents

29
00:01:09.933 --> 00:01:10.966
Also like it very much

30
00:01:10.966 --> 00:01:12.966
Since the program team asked me to be the judge

31
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.433
But I will definitely give you a fair judgment

32
00:01:16.733 --> 00:01:18.566
For the talent in your eyes

33
00:01:18.566 --> 00:01:19.766
Offend Chen Tianhao and don't get drunk

34
00:01:19.766 --> 00:01:22.900
The program team will even ruin your singing career

35
00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:24.900
Is it worth it?
