00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:03.166
Which eye do you see that is not a window?

2
00:00:03.266 --> 00:00:04.300
Not a window

3
00:00:04.733 --> 00:00:05.966
I'll tell you what.

4
00:00:06.566 --> 00:00:09.766
Today, half of the songs on the platform are sitting under the platform

5
00:00:09.766 --> 00:00:12.466
Just to give this stage to the legendary singer

6
00:00:12.466 --> 00:00:14.666
You're a worthless nonsense

7
00:00:14.766 --> 00:00:17.100
What does it mean to come to this place with a good end?

8
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.933
Yeah, this guy's got to be nuts.

9
00:00:19.933 --> 00:00:20.766
Chufan

10
00:00:20.966 --> 00:00:23.766
You put gold on your face to prove yourself

11
00:00:23.766 --> 00:00:26.000
Even the rules of the Golden Melody Awards are ignored

12
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.666
The stage of the masked singer

13
00:00:27.666 --> 00:00:30.166
How can you, a waste, be defiled?

14
00:00:30.166 --> 00:00:32.266
I defiled Chufan

15
00:00:32.466 --> 00:00:34.266
I never thought you were such a person

16
00:00:34.266 --> 00:00:36.366
For the anger in my heart

17
00:00:36.366 --> 00:00:37.800
Disturb my world

18
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.700
Humiliating the song god again and again

19
00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.700
Why haven't I seen you so kind before?

20
00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:43.533
What about narrow-minded people?

21
00:00:43.533 --> 00:00:44.800
We have known each other for so long

22
00:00:45.166 --> 00:00:47.900
In your heart, I am such a person

23
00:00:48.066 --> 00:00:49.866
But you don't have to be self-righteous.

24
00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.800
I don't want to make trouble for you.

25
00:00:53.133 --> 00:00:55.200
Stop pretending here

26
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.966
You think we don't know

27
00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.466
Since your divorce

28
00:00:58.466 --> 00:01:01.333
We see all your despicable tricks

29
00:01:01.333 --> 00:01:04.400
I suggest you get out of here

30
00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.833
Otherwise, no one can save you if you get into trouble later

31
00:01:09.133 --> 00:01:10.500
Causing trouble

32
00:01:10.533 --> 00:01:12.066
Don't think there is Chairperson Zhou

33
00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.900
Without Yunzu, you can die if we protect you.

34
00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:16.400
I'll tell you what.

35
00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.600
There are dicks sitting under this stage today

36
00:01:20.566 --> 00:01:21.700
My fans

37
00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:25.366
I really haven't seen them in a long time

38
00:01:25.366 --> 00:01:27.600
Stop pretending, I'll tell you.

39
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.666
Mr. Xu has already arranged everything

40
00:01:31.333 --> 00:01:34.166
What time are you still pretending here?

41
00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.466
Wait a minute, Van is here

42
00:01:36.666 --> 00:01:38.200
See how you do it

43
00:01:38.566 --> 00:01:39.400
Mr. Xu

44
00:01:40.266 --> 00:01:41.866
It's time for this

45
00:01:41.933 --> 00:01:43.800
You still believe his nonsense

46
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.766
Don't believe him, do you believe you?

47
00:01:46.766 --> 00:01:48.000
I'll tell you what.

48
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.033
Mr. Xu has arranged everything

49
00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.400
He will let Miss Jiang and Li Fan perform on stage together

50
00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.600
Fully support Miss Jiang's career

51
00:01:55.933 --> 00:01:59.533
And you, besides hugging Miss Jiang and eating and drinking

52
00:01:59.533 --> 00:02:00.566
Useless

53
00:02:00.566 --> 00:02:02.266
Who said nothing?
