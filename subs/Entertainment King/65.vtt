1
00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.333
Chairperson Zhou, are you mistaken?

2
00:00:02.333 --> 00:00:04.766
The peerless double pride of the Chinese music scene, Chairperson Zhou

3
00:00:04.766 --> 00:00:07.000
To do this to an unknown little person

4
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.100
What kind of nerve is this transmission?

5
00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:10.966
A music godfather like Zhou Dong

6
00:00:10.966 --> 00:00:12.200
Also in front of the fan

7
00:00:12.566 --> 00:00:14.166
Can't he

8
00:00:14.166 --> 00:00:16.000
He is the little boss of a folk music store

9
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.366
How could he be a big shot?

10
00:00:17.366 --> 00:00:18.600
Whether he is an adult or not

11
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.033
Ancestral identity

12
00:00:20.066 --> 00:00:22.366
You people are also not qualified to judge

13
00:00:22.366 --> 00:00:24.766
Wait, I know when you were in the country

14
00:00:24.766 --> 00:00:26.433
But you have to think about it.

15
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:28.333
For this nameless person

16
00:00:28.333 --> 00:00:30.200
To crush our entire entertainment industry

17
00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:31.766
To support his identity

18
00:00:31.766 --> 00:00:34.366
Aren't you afraid that everyone will disagree?

19
00:00:34.366 --> 00:00:35.166
Mr. Xu

20
00:00:35.566 --> 00:00:37.466
You mean my bullying you?

21
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.266
Do I know

22
00:00:41.266 --> 00:00:41.933
Chairperson Zhou

23
00:00:41.933 --> 00:00:45.433
You're going to openly oppose our entire Chinese-American orchestra

24
00:00:45.866 --> 00:00:48.133
To raise this flying waste

25
00:00:48.133 --> 00:00:50.600
The Rising Stars Finals are about to begin

26
00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.266
I'll ask in person then.

27
00:00:53.966 --> 00:00:55.266
How did they teach you?

28
00:00:55.266 --> 00:00:58.566
Mr. Xu should guide you and these people first

29
00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:00.833
Sorry Mr. Zhou

30
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.433
This surnamed Zhou is too ignorant of praise

31
00:01:09.533 --> 00:01:11.400
Relying on Van's guidance to him

32
00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.566
He single-handedly took him back to the leader of the Chinese music scene

33
00:01:13.566 --> 00:01:16.666
The character even has Mr. Xu's face

34
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.033
Autumn horse fork

35
00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:20.666
You still don't believe that you dare not marry Mr. Xu

36
00:01:20.666 --> 00:01:24.500
This Zhou and Yun always think about cooking

37
00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:25.633
You say this cooks

38
00:01:26.266 --> 00:01:27.600
Not really a big deal

39
00:01:27.933 --> 00:01:30.400
Big shots wait for two shifts to pay

40
00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.500
Our global entertainment presence in China

41
00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.433
Become the only forbidden area in the country

42
00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:36.033
When collecting

43
00:01:36.666 --> 00:01:39.433
I'll take him off the clinic

44
00:01:57.666 --> 00:02:01.333
Welcome to the Rising Stars Finals

45
00:02:01.333 --> 00:02:04.766
The stars must be shining on this stage tonight

46
00:02:04.766 --> 00:02:06.900
The first person to own Baiyun Courtyard

47
00:02:06.933 --> 00:02:08.300
Legendary singer

48
00:02:08.566 --> 00:02:10.966
The magic trick is not a snake eye

49
00:02:18.533 --> 00:02:19.333
Wait a minute.

50
00:02:19.933 --> 00:02:22.866
This channel is reserved for the legendary brother god

51
00:02:22.866 --> 00:02:23.866
What kind of god are you?

52
00:02:23.866 --> 00:02:25.433
How dare you retreat on the road
