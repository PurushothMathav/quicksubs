00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:01.266
You're right.

2
00:00:01.266 --> 00:00:04.600
The Golden Melody Award has always been about status

3
00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:06.900
And fame in the music world

4
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:08.000
These people who came today

5
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.666
It's the best of our media companies

6
00:00:11.566 --> 00:00:12.433
Ah he

7
00:00:12.966 --> 00:00:14.266
Why are you here?

8
00:00:14.266 --> 00:00:15.466
What do you mean?

9
00:00:15.466 --> 00:00:16.766
Don't you understand?

10
00:00:16.766 --> 00:00:19.400
Which one of you is not borrowing money?

11
00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:22.466
The Kumquat Award is the highest honor in the Chinese music scene

12
00:00:22.466 --> 00:00:24.000
When is it his turn?

13
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.166
A ring finger is our wish

14
00:00:26.166 --> 00:00:28.600
The company has decided to sign an agreement with Mr. Chu

15
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
He is now the lead owner of our company

16
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:31.533
how

17
00:00:31.533 --> 00:00:34.133
Isn't your status enough to attend the ceremony?

18
00:00:34.133 --> 00:00:36.400
There is still no problem that you represent the new moon capital.

19
00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.400
Mother-in-law, you asked him to represent the newcomer

20
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.033
It's not just us.

21
00:00:40.133 --> 00:00:42.100
It's your fan guide.

22
00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.866
Will there be others in our dad's company?

23
00:00:44.866 --> 00:00:47.400
Besides, it mainly promotes such a waste

24
00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.333
Mr. Chen, I advise you to save money

25
00:00:50.333 --> 00:00:52.533
I, Xu Ruotian, have a word here

26
00:00:52.533 --> 00:00:53.466
You can let him

27
00:00:53.466 --> 00:00:55.266
I didn't even have a chance to debut today

28
00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.700
Since today is the night of the Golden Melody Awards ceremony

29
00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.266
Then we will follow the grievances of the party

30
00:01:01.266 --> 00:01:02.966
Whether it is the speed of fans

31
00:01:02.966 --> 00:01:05.000
Or the status of the Chinese Orchestra

32
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.900
Identity must be enough to support

33
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.966
Doing your worst will help.

34
00:01:10.366 --> 00:01:11.333
You're right.

35
00:01:11.333 --> 00:01:13.866
He's a useless trash Accord

36
00:01:13.866 --> 00:01:15.133
I don't deserve to be here

37
00:01:15.133 --> 00:01:17.400
Only by gaining a foothold in the Chinese music scene

38
00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.200
Have a certain status

39
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.200
To deserve this music festival

40
00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.366
And you're not qualified at all

41
00:01:23.366 --> 00:01:26.400
Going to a dinner party with someone like this

42
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.900
It's not embarrassing enough

43
00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.300
What are we in the music scene?

44
00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.566
You cooperate with us to work hard together

45
00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.366
Get out of here

46
00:01:33.366 --> 00:01:34.166
Get out

47
00:01:34.166 --> 00:01:37.700
Get me out of the Chinese music scene at any cost

48
00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.100
You can afford it.
