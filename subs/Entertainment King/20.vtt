00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.333
How can you be so sure I can't get up?

2
00:00:02.333 --> 00:00:05.000
Hey, the whole venue is full of Mr. Chen's people

3
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.600
You don't even have the qualifications to go on stage

4
00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.700
My tickets and those of the other two judges have been booked

5
00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:10.800
One remaining judge

6
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.666
It is the top traffic in the entertainment industry now.

7
00:00:12.666 --> 00:00:14.900
Talent is also the most popular special on the whole network

8
00:00:15.066 --> 00:00:16.833
5 doesn't cooperate at all

9
00:00:16.966 --> 00:00:20.000
You, a lowly piece of trash, play with him on stage

10
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.400
The saliva of fans can drown you

11
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:23.366
No ability

12
00:00:23.366 --> 00:00:26.166
Don't invite Chen Tianhou to sing in the Chinese music scene

13
00:00:26.166 --> 00:00:28.533
Chen Yao, whether it is strength or younger brother

14
00:00:28.533 --> 00:00:29.733
Including fans

15
00:00:29.733 --> 00:00:32.000
They are all benchmark people in the Chinese music scene

16
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.566
It is worthy of your identity.

17
00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.066
Do you think so too?

18
00:00:36.066 --> 00:00:37.700
Chu Fan, what qualifications do you have?

19
00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:39.566
To accept such a top-notch person

20
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.000
Maybe.

21
00:00:42.166 --> 00:00:45.400
Chen Tianhou bought musical instruments from him

22
00:00:45.566 --> 00:00:49.666
I will definitely arrange today's game for you.

23
00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.900
Notify all companies in the entertainment industry Page 3 ends

24
00:00:53.933 --> 00:00:55.166
one person ban

25
00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.100
As soon as the major shows start blocking

26
00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.900
You have no place in the entertainment industry

27
00:01:03.766 --> 00:01:06.066
No matter how good your relationship with Mr. Wang is

28
00:01:06.333 --> 00:01:08.366
He can't be a waste for you

29
00:01:08.366 --> 00:01:09.900
Offend the entire entertainment industry

30
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.400
Hosting I think you should know by now

31
00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:13.866
What is the water in the entertainment industry?

32
00:01:13.866 --> 00:01:15.766
No strength, background and connections

33
00:01:15.766 --> 00:01:17.133
Even I can't make my dreams come true

34
00:01:17.133 --> 00:01:19.000
I hope you are happy this time.

35
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.466
Lose your own balance

36
00:01:23.933 --> 00:01:25.766
His surname is Chen in this place.

37
00:01:25.933 --> 00:01:27.766
You are taking a good look now

38
00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.700
Who else can include you here?
