1
00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:01.300
I choose

2
00:00:02.066 --> 00:00:02.966
Solo

3
00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:06.200
Chorus Solo

4
00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:08.500
Chu Fan, please think about it.

5
00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:09.900
If you choose to sing solo

6
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.800
Must trump three mentors on the ticket

7
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.066
And other players

8
00:00:14.066 --> 00:00:16.033
To qualify for the finals

9
00:00:17.166 --> 00:00:19.166
The first thing in my heart is a delicate song

10
00:00:19.166 --> 00:00:20.200
Clothes are almost filtered

11
00:00:20.566 --> 00:00:22.500
How can we die if you are angry?

12
00:00:22.566 --> 00:00:24.100
You want to rely on a song to solicit votes

13
00:00:24.533 --> 00:00:25.733
I'll ask you how the show is going

14
00:00:25.733 --> 00:00:26.500
Hey, no need.

15
00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.000
No matter how positive

16
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.933
This is the secret of my talent

17
00:00:29.933 --> 00:00:31.800
And that was the intent of the stage.

18
00:00:31.866 --> 00:00:35.100
Since Chu Fan chose to sing solo

19
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.266
Then I hand over the stage to the contestant Chu Fan

20
00:00:38.266 --> 00:00:39.533
The stage for tomorrow's stars

21
00:00:39.533 --> 00:00:41.600
It was originally reserved for the talented

22
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.200
A place where dreams come true

23
00:00:43.333 --> 00:00:44.300
Even if it arrives

24
00:00:44.933 --> 00:00:46.200
Even if you are not

25
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.433
Even if unknown

26
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.266
Make the people you like your own heroes
