1
00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:02.500
Do you want to invite capital again?

2
00:00:04.566 --> 00:00:05.866
Save it, Chufan

3
00:00:05.866 --> 00:00:07.066
You don't know yet

4
00:00:07.066 --> 00:00:08.600
Invitation to the Golden Melody Awards

5
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:10.900
It is the pinnacle of Chinese music

6
00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:12.900
Except for the legendary singer

7
00:00:12.933 --> 00:00:14.966
Others are not eligible to get it at all

8
00:00:14.966 --> 00:00:16.700
You're still pretending here

9
00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:18.700
If I also

10
00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.133
You're not even a third-rate singer

11
00:00:22.133 --> 00:00:23.333
What qualifications do you have to get?

12
00:00:23.333 --> 00:00:26.366
Ask to be compared to the masked singer

13
00:00:26.533 --> 00:00:28.066
What are you?

14
00:00:28.166 --> 00:00:30.000
You don't know who I am.

15
00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:31.866
It's because your status is too low

16
00:00:34.266 --> 00:00:35.366
You two come here

17
00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.700
Golden Melody Awards Ceremony

18
00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:40.000
Not all cats and dogs can come in

19
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.333
Now check his ID

20
00:00:41.333 --> 00:00:42.866
If he wants no

21
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.366
Get him out of here! Hold on

22
00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.500
What if I had?

23
00:00:50.866 --> 00:00:52.066
If you take it out

24
00:00:52.066 --> 00:00:54.900
I knelt down in front of everyone and kowtowed to you and apologized

25
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.900
But if you can't answer, I'll tell you

26
00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:59.933
I'm going to disgrace you today

27
00:00:59.933 --> 00:01:01.566
Never raise your head

28
00:01:01.566 --> 00:01:02.366
Shufen

29
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:03.966
Can you listen to my advice?

30
00:01:03.966 --> 00:01:06.266
You have no idea what this invitation means

31
00:01:06.266 --> 00:01:07.600
To fulfill this invitation

32
00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.600
Not only must it be recognized by Skylark International

33
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.700
Absolute identity and status

34
00:01:11.866 --> 00:01:13.900
To get the unanimous panel of the jury

35
00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.800
Stop being obsessed

36
00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.500
Now except for the legendary singer in the Chinese music scene

37
00:01:21.566 --> 00:01:23.600
No one can meet this qualification at all

38
00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.500
You are a down-and-out leapfrog boss

39
00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.433
What qualifications do you have to receive such an invitation?

40
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.700
Mr. Chen has already given you the money.

41
00:01:31.733 --> 00:01:34.200
But why are you still losing face here?

42
00:01:34.966 --> 00:01:36.666
I'm not you

43
00:01:36.766 --> 00:01:39.966
Keep your eyes peeled.
