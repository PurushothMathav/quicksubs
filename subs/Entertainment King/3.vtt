1
00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:02.666
Get the money and get out of my life

2
00:00:05.733 --> 00:00:07.466
Let's give it a big hand.

3
00:00:07.466 --> 00:00:09.133
Welcome to the first winner

4
00:00:09.133 --> 00:00:10.133
He is at work

5
00:00:10.133 --> 00:00:12.700
Showed unparalleled enthusiasm and professionalism

6
00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:14.766
Is this your dream?

7
00:00:14.766 --> 00:00:16.600
You for this name

8
00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:19.333
We can give up our 5-year marriage

9
00:00:19.333 --> 00:00:20.533
punished

10
00:00:20.533 --> 00:00:23.500
You want to take advantage of Miss Jiang's small thoughts of clinging to power

11
00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:25.266
We've seen it through

12
00:00:25.266 --> 00:00:28.100
For a useless waste like you

13
00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:29.833
Don't you just think it's too little?

14
00:00:30.066 --> 00:00:31.866
I cling to power

15
00:00:31.866 --> 00:00:33.633
I am worthless

16
00:00:33.933 --> 00:00:35.300
Isn't it?

17
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.566
Mr. Chen, why are you here?

18
00:00:39.666 --> 00:00:43.266
This is the signing contract for the chief judge of Rising Stars

19
00:00:43.266 --> 00:00:45.066
With the largest selection in the country

20
00:00:45.066 --> 00:00:47.166

Wo Tiansheng Group

23
00:00:49.566 --> 00:00:52.266
It can lift you to the position in the future

24
00:00:53.566 --> 00:00:55.966
You believe this nonsense

25
00:00:55.966 --> 00:00:59.033
Don't believe me, do you believe you?

26
00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.400
I should introduce myself to you

27
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.233
Executive Director of Benren Crescent Media

28
00:01:04.566 --> 00:01:07.233
Chen Tianhao Executive Director

29
00:01:07.366 --> 00:01:10.666
This is the confidence in your divorce, right?

30
00:01:11.466 --> 00:01:13.333
Mr. Chu may not know it yet

31
00:01:13.333 --> 00:01:14.900
I just got the news.

32
00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.766
The masked song god of the year is about to make a comeback

33
00:01:17.766 --> 00:01:18.766
By then

34
00:01:18.766 --> 00:01:22.666
I will invite Miss Jiang to perform on the same stage as the masked singer

35
00:01:22.666 --> 00:01:25.633
I wish Miss Jiang back to the peak of entertainment

36
00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.033
Xiaorou

37
00:01:29.366 --> 00:01:32.833
There is no need to be angry with him at this time

38
00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:45.866
OK

39
00:01:47.166 --> 00:01:48.000
I sign

40
00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:49.600
I sign

41
00:01:57.166 --> 00:01:58.633
I wish you all the best.

42
00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.100
Become a diva soon

43
00:02:04.466 --> 00:02:05.266
Xiaorou

44
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.366
Mr. Wang

45
00:02:14.366 --> 00:02:16.866
I chanted the song, and the news of the payment was sent out.

46
00:02:16.866 --> 00:02:19.233
All the hot topics today are him

47
00:02:20.466 --> 00:02:21.466
Call the only song god

48
00:02:21.466 --> 00:02:23.333
I thought I would never hear his songs again

49
00:02:23.333 --> 00:02:24.566
What is God's new song?

50
00:02:24.566 --> 00:02:25.533
Will it go beyond cloudy days?

51
00:02:25.533 --> 00:02:26.933
A Chinese teacher like Sunny Day

52
00:02:26.933 --> 00:02:30.600
Surprise, I chased the star of tomorrow for the god of song

53
00:02:35.066 --> 00:02:37.466
Issue an announcement in the name of Star and Moon Media

54
00:02:37.466 --> 00:02:39.033
Masked Song God Watch

55
00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:42.100
Will be on the scene of the Star of Fame finals

56
00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:43.000
Remove the mask

57
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.700
I will show my true face in the future
