00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:03.666
Why can't I do it?

2
00:00:05.666 --> 00:00:08.866
Well, I hope you can move on to the next step

3
00:00:08.933 --> 00:00:09.900
Just don't be eliminated

4
00:00:10.866 --> 00:00:11.833
What do you mean?

5
00:00:12.266 --> 00:00:14.700
The two of us will not be eliminated at all

6
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.633
You care more about yourself

7
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.066
Who the hell wants to hurry up?

8
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.033
Accompany Mr. Liu for a drink

9
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.100
I can lift you to the top position

10
00:00:46.366 --> 00:00:48.100
This is the entertainment industry

11
00:00:52.166 --> 00:00:55.200
I'm sorry, I won't sell myself for popularity.

12
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.500
What are you pretending to be pure?

13
00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.000
Shameless

14
00:01:27.766 --> 00:01:30.000
Hey, you wrote well

15
00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:31.800
But these words, thank you.

16
00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.233
I want to stop and leave my feet

17
00:01:51.266 --> 00:01:52.800
Forget your traces

18
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.866
Step out of the station

19
00:02:04.166 --> 00:02:07.100
And the weather in Nagano is still so warm

20
00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:08.633
The wind blew in the past

21
00:02:08.866 --> 00:02:12.100
Basketball basketball basketball

22
00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.600
Unexpectedly, I changed this song Rising Wind for him.

23
00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.000
Helped him so much

24
00:02:17.666 --> 00:02:18.900
The song you changed

25
00:02:19.066 --> 00:02:21.600
You really put gold on your face
