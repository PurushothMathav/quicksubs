1
00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:03.833
I'm singing a song today. Wait a minute.

2
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.266
I don't think this singer is qualified to sing.

3
00:00:10.266 --> 00:00:11.333
The stage for tomorrow's trip

4
00:00:11.333 --> 00:00:13.733
Ask contestants to prepare their own original songs

5
00:00:13.733 --> 00:00:14.833
Chufan display

6
00:00:15.266 --> 00:00:17.066
What qualifications do you have to ask Chen Gen?

7
00:00:17.066 --> 00:00:17.700
It's that simple.

8
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:18.800
Excuse me again for your song

9
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.166
What qualifications do you have?

10
00:00:20.166 --> 00:00:22.800
Ask a national treasure singer to perform your work

11
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:23.600
Exactly.

12
00:00:24.166 --> 00:00:26.666
The adult world is the mainstream of our Chinese music scene

13
00:00:26.666 --> 00:00:29.066
He represents the highest level in the country

14
00:00:29.066 --> 00:00:30.800
The person who composed the lyrics for him

15
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.900
Which one is not a ray of hope?

16
00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:34.133
Top Producer

17
00:00:34.133 --> 00:00:35.733
What is a nuisance

18
00:00:35.733 --> 00:00:37.200
Even if the program team arranges

19
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.500
Ask the judges and contestants to sing together

20
00:00:39.533 --> 00:00:41.766
It doesn't mean that people like Chen Tianhou

21
00:00:41.766 --> 00:00:42.933
Need to surrender

22
00:00:42.933 --> 00:00:44.533
With an unknown

23
00:00:44.533 --> 00:00:46.700
Contestants who have achieved nothing sing together

24
00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:48.700
The instructors have a point.

25
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.666
Adult or later

26
00:00:50.933 --> 00:00:52.166
The stage of the heart of fame

27
00:00:52.166 --> 00:00:53.700
It's for the talented.

28
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.600
A fair stage to showcase your dreams

29
00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.266
The criterion for judging a song

30
00:00:57.266 --> 00:00:58.700
It was never created by anyone

31
00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:59.666
And who likes it?

32
00:00:59.666 --> 00:01:01.533
If the audience likes this song

33
00:01:01.533 --> 00:01:04.066
Then I, Chen Yao, am willing to sing for my dream

34
00:01:04.766 --> 00:01:06.300
Since it is a fair substance

35
00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:07.933
Then ask for the workshop number.

36
00:01:07.933 --> 00:01:10.600
Lower than your number of fans and platform

37
00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:11.900
To the polling room

38
00:01:12.166 --> 00:01:14.766
Will it get the vote of this unknown player?

39
00:01:14.766 --> 00:01:18.633
Well, that in itself is unfair and unfair

40
00:01:18.666 --> 00:01:20.566
Unfair unfair

41
00:01:20.566 --> 00:01:21.566
That's not fair.

42
00:01:21.566 --> 00:01:23.566
This is how the program team was originally arranged

43
00:01:23.566 --> 00:01:25.366
Is your final vote

44
00:01:25.366 --> 00:01:26.866
Don't you have a fan base?

45
00:01:26.866 --> 00:01:28.333
The players we selected

46
00:01:28.333 --> 00:01:30.700
It has a certain fan base in itself

47
00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.500
Even with our popularity

48
00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.833
That is also the strong alliance with each other

49
00:01:35.166 --> 00:01:37.400
That's right, we make music with our hearts

50
00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.600
Instead of relying on some conspiracy and intrigue to hug the thighs

51
00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.666
Chufan, an amateur like you

52
00:01:42.666 --> 00:01:45.700
Isn't it because of Chen Yao's fame and popularity?

53
00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.400
That's right, what rubbish rubbed my Muse heat

54
00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:49.900
What kind of trash did the show choose?

55
00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:50.866
Retire him

56
00:01:50.866 --> 00:01:52.600
Withdraw Withdraw

57
00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.166
Withdraw Withdraw

58
00:01:55.333 --> 00:01:56.400
Everyone be quiet

59
00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:57.933
After consultation with the program team

60
00:01:57.933 --> 00:01:59.900
Chen Tianhou is the lead singer of Chu Fan

61
00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:02.600
It does violate the justice and fairness of this show

62
00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:03.600
After negotiation

63
00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.266
Our program team hands over the decision to Chu Fan

64
00:02:06.266 --> 00:02:07.600
Contestant Chu Fan

65
00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:09.333
If you choose to sing solo

66
00:02:09.333 --> 00:02:11.966
We will score you according to the normal number of votes.

67
00:02:11.966 --> 00:02:14.300
If you insist on letting Chen Tianhou sing

68
00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:15.900
Then this score will be invalid

69
00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.400
You will face the result of being eliminated

70
00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.766
Tired of controlling the game

71
00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.600
That's all you've got left.

72
00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:31.833
You are a waste

73
00:02:32.166 --> 00:02:33.500
What to fight with us

74
00:02:33.666 --> 00:02:36.633
This is the price you pay for avoiding

75
00:02:39.566 --> 00:02:40.666
I choose

76
00:02:41.566 --> 00:02:42.466
Solo
