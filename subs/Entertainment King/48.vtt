00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.300
Whether it is Jiang Rou or Chen Tianhao

2
00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:04.500
See me as a thorn in the side

3
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:05.866
If you cooperate with me

4
00:00:05.866 --> 00:00:08.666
The pressure on your cloud blood international is afraid

5
00:00:08.666 --> 00:00:09.966
Not too small, right?

6
00:00:09.966 --> 00:00:11.600
I would like to advance and retreat with Mr. Chu

7
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:13.566
You bet on me

8
00:00:13.566 --> 00:00:15.500
You are not afraid of failure

9
00:00:15.766 --> 00:00:17.466
Lose everything?

10
00:00:17.466 --> 00:00:18.200
No regrets

11
00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:19.200
If you lose

12
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.100
I also fought with Mr. Chu

13
00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:21.966
Fight to the death

14
00:00:21.966 --> 00:00:22.933
But I believe

15
00:00:22.933 --> 00:00:25.400
Since Mr. Chu has come to the stage of his dreams

16
00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:27.766
I won't let my dream Goku

17
00:00:27.866 --> 00:00:29.433
I promise you.

18
00:00:31.166 --> 00:00:32.300
Happy cooperation

19
00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:40.000
Here it is.

20
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.233
This is a special invitation to the Golden Melody Awards ceremony

21
00:00:43.866 --> 00:00:46.800
I would like to invite Mr. Chu as the finale guest

22
00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:50.066
For the biggest award of the year, the best singer

23
00:00:50.066 --> 00:00:52.133
As the most prestigious award in the country

24
00:00:52.133 --> 00:00:54.800
The best singer has always been a hot topic of discussion

25
00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:55.966
If Mr. Chu

26
00:00:55.966 --> 00:00:57.933
To be able to attend this awards ceremony

27
00:00:57.933 --> 00:01:00.500
Mr. Chu's popularity has also increased to a certain extent

28
00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:01.633
Popularity

29
00:01:01.933 --> 00:01:03.600
Mr. Chu in the finals

30
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.433
To get fan votes

31
00:01:06.133 --> 00:01:09.433
The next competition for Rising Stars is a chorus

32
00:01:09.933 --> 00:01:11.900
The four mentors will choose a singer

33
00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:13.766
After the wind came out of the mentor

34
00:01:13.766 --> 00:01:15.333
You just need to borrow this song

35
00:01:15.333 --> 00:01:17.800
You can listen to them grumpy again

36
00:01:17.866 --> 00:01:18.866
As far as I know

37
00:01:19.566 --> 00:01:22.700
The presenters of the Golden Melody Awards are all kings

38
00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.400
I didn't even make my debut.

39
00:01:24.933 --> 00:01:25.866
Is it appropriate?
