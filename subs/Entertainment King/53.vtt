00:00:00.533 --> 00:00:01.333
Invitation letter

2
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.766
And here's the signature of the head of the jury

3
00:00:05.766 --> 00:00:07.966
Is he fake?

4
00:00:07.966 --> 00:00:09.700
He's a useless piece of crap.

5
00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:11.266
How can I possibly get an invitation?

6
00:00:11.266 --> 00:00:13.900
It's fake, but he forged it.

7
00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:15.533
Zhou Dong is a traffic star

8
00:00:15.533 --> 00:00:17.633
Signatures are everywhere online.

9
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:21.166
He must have brought it over by himself

10
00:00:21.166 --> 00:00:23.900
Otherwise, if he is a big shot

11
00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.866
Why are you willing to be by Jiang Rao's side for so many years?

12
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.333
Chu Fan, you are so brave

13
00:00:29.333 --> 00:00:32.300
Even official letters like invitations dare to interpret

14
00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:34.266
You are not afraid of going to prison and going on a boat

15
00:00:34.266 --> 00:00:35.600
Stop pretending, Chufan

16
00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.600
In order to entangle us, Miss Jiang

17
00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.066
You can do anything

18
00:00:39.266 --> 00:00:40.333
Bajiedao Lark

19
00:00:40.333 --> 00:00:43.466
Hiding to Xingyue and lying about being a masked song god

20
00:00:43.466 --> 00:00:45.166
Now in such an official

21
00:00:45.166 --> 00:00:47.366
Fang's show site co-dye and create cocoons

22
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:55.666
I don't need to use a fake yet, hahaha.

23
00:00:55.766 --> 00:00:56.133
gold

24
00:00:56.133 --> 00:00:59.166
The Song Award has only been given out once

25
00:00:59.166 --> 00:01:01.866
That is to give the masked song god therapy back then

26
00:01:01.933 --> 00:01:03.933
You said your invitation is still true

27
00:01:03.933 --> 00:01:04.933
So what do you mean?

28
00:01:04.933 --> 00:01:08.333
You can rival the existence of the legendary song god

29
00:01:08.333 --> 00:01:10.966
Mr. Chen, your efforts to reverse black and white

30
00:01:10.966 --> 00:01:12.566
That is truly amazing!

31
00:01:12.566 --> 00:01:13.566
You said it wrong.

32
00:01:13.566 --> 00:01:15.833
I am the masked song god

33
00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:18.200
I don't need to pretend
