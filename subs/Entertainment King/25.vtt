1
00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:01.500
Ok, I'll go to work.

2
00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:07.133
Isn't it bad that Mr. Chen doesn't let them rehearse?

3
00:00:07.133 --> 00:00:09.933
The time left by our program team for the players is

4
00:00:09.933 --> 00:00:10.400
one

5
00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:11.900
They don't prepare it themselves.

6
00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:14.100
Derailed our airtime

7
00:00:14.166 --> 00:00:15.700
But we can't anymore

8
00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:17.200
But but

9
00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:18.800
Today's top 10 hits at Waletan

10
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.166
The award selection team will be here soon

11
00:00:20.766 --> 00:00:22.700
If you let them know about it

12
00:00:22.866 --> 00:00:25.233
Your dad will have a big impact on our show

13
00:00:25.266 --> 00:00:26.866
What if they

14
00:00:27.666 --> 00:00:28.766
These people

15
00:00:30.366 --> 00:00:32.966
That hit is the hottest news in the music industry

16
00:00:32.966 --> 00:00:35.066
The leader of the selection team

17
00:00:35.266 --> 00:00:36.166
But in the music world

18
00:00:36.166 --> 00:00:38.500
Famous musicians who have occupied the country for ten years

19
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:42.033
I heard that he was a disciple trained by the masked song god himself

20
00:00:42.133 --> 00:00:43.300
Mr. Chen, you are looking for

21
00:00:43.766 --> 00:00:46.566
I can get out of so many companies

22
00:00:46.766 --> 00:00:48.633
It's all about connections.

23
00:00:49.333 --> 00:00:50.200
strength

24
00:00:51.166 --> 00:00:52.200
And background

25
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.366
The head of the evaluation team values me very much

26
00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:57.500
To my company

27
00:00:57.966 --> 00:00:59.300
Also very helpful

28
00:01:00.466 --> 00:01:03.233
Mr. Chen has such a powerful network of contacts

29
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.166
This year's top 10 Golden Melody Awards

30
00:01:06.166 --> 00:01:08.300
Take advantage of the reputation of this selection patriarch

31
00:01:08.466 --> 00:01:11.566
In addition to Miss Jiang's excellent singing

32
00:01:12.166 --> 00:01:14.600
The award for best female singer

33
00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:16.600
So I nod my head.

34
00:01:26.766 --> 00:01:29.066
Mr. Chen, my affairs after that

35
00:01:29.066 --> 00:01:31.000
I'll bother you a lot.

36
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.766
Don't worry, as long as the selection director says a word

37
00:01:35.133 --> 00:01:37.966
You are today's frozen frame

38
00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:41.700
Just got the news.

39
00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.966
Zhou Lilun, the leader of the enterprising selection team of the times

40
00:01:43.966 --> 00:01:45.200
Will be there in person

41
00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.266
Zhou Lielun is right

42
00:01:47.666 --> 00:01:48.966
The stage for tomorrow's stars

43
00:01:48.966 --> 00:01:51.133
Every year, a much-anticipated crown is selected

44
00:01:51.133 --> 00:01:53.900
The military as the most influential development star

45
00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:56.033
He is also one of the winners of the top ten songs.

46
00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.600
The songs he wrote?

47
00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.666
It was also one of the top ten hits of the year

48
00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.100
The leader of this selection team

49
00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.666
Zhou Lielun, who is also the most influential in the Chinese music industry

50
00:02:03.766 --> 00:02:05.366
Although it has faded off the stage

51
00:02:05.366 --> 00:02:07.633
But as the top judge

52
00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.066
All the players want his approval

53
00:02:10.066 --> 00:02:11.600
Because the players know

54
00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:12.766
Even without the crown

55
00:02:12.766 --> 00:02:14.966
Army, but with Zhou Lielun's affirmation

56
00:02:14.966 --> 00:02:17.033
You will definitely be a true star of tomorrow

57
00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:18.866
And will get the highest topic of conversation

58
00:02:18.866 --> 00:02:22.366
After so many years, he still has the top ten hits

59
00:02:25.566 --> 00:02:26.366
Mr. Zhu
