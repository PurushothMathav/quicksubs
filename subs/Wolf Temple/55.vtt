00:00:01.666 --> 00:00:03.400
How is it? Does it look good?

2
00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:05.600
Everything you give looks good.

3
00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:08.666
Who is it so late?

4
00:00:08.666 --> 00:00:10.833
It's okay, I'll take a look.

5
00:00:16.933 --> 00:00:18.766
Why are you here?

6
00:00:18.966 --> 00:00:22.000
You courier, don't come to my daughter

7
00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:23.066
Get out

8
00:00:23.733 --> 00:00:25.766
Two old turtles

9
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.366
Who the hell are you talking about?

10
00:00:29.266 --> 00:00:32.466
Mom, Dad, my daughter!

11
00:00:32.533 --> 00:00:34.500
Mom misses you mom

12
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.466
What is the money you took back to me?

13
00:00:36.866 --> 00:00:38.066
How do you take it?

14
00:00:38.066 --> 00:00:40.066
Oops, mom, that's a loan.

15
00:00:40.266 --> 00:00:41.966
Where can I take it?

16
00:00:42.133 --> 00:00:43.966
Oh girl

17
00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.533
The grace of parenting, can't you?

18
00:00:46.533 --> 00:00:48.566
Maybe it's not my money dad

19
00:00:48.566 --> 00:00:49.800
What do you mean?

20
00:00:49.933 --> 00:00:51.900
Bai wants you to be so big.

21
00:00:52.366 --> 00:00:54.633
Is it just a little stricter sometimes?

22
00:00:54.866 --> 00:00:56.466
Isn't that still good for you?

23
00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:59.266
Oh, do you believe it yourself?

24
00:00:59.266 --> 00:01:00.066
Blame you for getting hurt
