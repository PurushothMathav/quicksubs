00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:03.100
Friend, he's an old friend of Ronan's

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.266
Do you still feel ashamed when you are pregnant?

3
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.566
Didn't I tell you today is a class reunion?

4
00:00:09.566 --> 00:00:11.066
Why are you still dressed like this?

5
00:00:11.333 --> 00:00:12.666
I thought you weren't going in.

6
00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.066
Then you can't come here dressed like this.

7
00:00:15.066 --> 00:00:18.200
You Ruolan, are you familiar with him?

8
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.700
Why don't you come and eat?

9
00:00:20.733 --> 00:00:22.166
Shameless thing

10
00:00:22.166 --> 00:00:22.766
Ruolan

11
00:00:22.766 --> 00:00:25.266
Did you know that when you're with someone like this

12
00:00:25.266 --> 00:00:27.333
It will only lower your status

13
00:00:27.333 --> 00:00:28.300
Don't say that.

14
00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:29.733
No, they deliver the courier.

15
00:00:29.733 --> 00:00:31.800
Our lives won't be the same

16
00:00:32.066 --> 00:00:36.100
Hey, in fact, the courier delivery is not the worst

17
00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.266
And those in debt are even worse

18
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.900
Hey, the students said Cao Cao

19
00:00:42.933 --> 00:00:44.800
Cao Cao is here

20
00:00:45.933 --> 00:00:46.733
Lu Xiangke

21
00:00:47.266 --> 00:00:50.866
Why are you?

22
00:00:50.866 --> 00:00:52.566
Lu Xiangke saved me

23
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.066
Ke Ye boy

24
00:00:54.166 --> 00:00:57.066
The two most placed in our class are waiting

25
00:00:57.366 --> 00:01:00.100
I'm a brat, our class reunion?

26
00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:01.700
It's AA.

27
00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:02.733
Can you afford it?

28
00:01:02.733 --> 00:01:03.533
you

29
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:05.733
Isn't it just a meal?

30
00:01:05.733 --> 00:01:06.866
What can't you afford?

31
00:01:07.066 --> 00:01:10.100
What's the matter, do you think the food is expensive?

32
00:01:10.466 --> 00:01:12.700
Expensive I have a lot of money

33
00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.766
Tell you, can you afford this local dog?

34
00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:18.500
Waiter, hello.

35
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.466
Take your most expensive dishes and wine
