1
00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.200
Long Shuai is that I don't know Mount Tai

2
00:00:04.266 --> 00:00:05.166
Yupei Dyson

3
00:00:06.966 --> 00:00:08.400
Count you kid

4
00:00:08.466 --> 00:00:11.933
Long Shuai has the greatest influence in Heijiang City

5
00:00:11.933 --> 00:00:14.066
You can ask me for help with anything.

6
00:00:14.066 --> 00:00:16.400
You kid is also a big career

7
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.933
There should be a lot of projects at hand, right?

8
00:00:18.933 --> 00:00:21.100
Lou Shuai wants to cooperate with me, no

9
00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.000
Not me.

10
00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:25.966
What? Okay? Okay?

11
00:00:27.366 --> 00:00:28.166
What's up?

12
00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:31.466
Optimus Leopard gave us 500 million project?

13
00:00:31.533 --> 00:00:34.500
The condition is to make the tall and weak man the largest shareholder

14
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:35.766
He is the chairperson

15
00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:36.866
I don't agree with that.

16
00:00:37.166 --> 00:00:40.400
He is also worthy of an orphan

17
00:00:41.066 --> 00:00:43.300
The conditions set by the punishment

18
00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:45.466
We can't refuse

19
00:00:45.866 --> 00:00:47.700
That's true.

20
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.300
Could it be that he is Ruolan at a glance?

21
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:51.866
That's nice.

22
00:00:52.266 --> 00:00:55.266
Optimus Panther is the underground boss of Hei Jiang

23
00:00:55.266 --> 00:00:58.066
He thinks it's good for us if it's difficult.

24
00:00:58.066 --> 00:01:01.600
Even the richest man, Linjiang, didn't dare to provoke him.

25
00:01:01.666 --> 00:01:04.600
If this Xingtian Leopard is our backer

26
00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:07.666
Then who is this Hei Jiang who dares to oppose us?

27
00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:13.266
If you want to drive me away, you can

28
00:01:13.266 --> 00:01:15.200
I need to be compensated according to the labor law.

29
00:01:15.533 --> 00:01:18.500
Come on, how could we chase you away?

30
00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.600
My mom still wants you to be the chairperson

31
00:01:20.766 --> 00:01:22.966
Really?

32
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.300
As long as you have a meal with Xing Tianbao

33
00:01:26.766 --> 00:01:29.300
Xing Tianbao has nothing to do with him

34
00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:33.166
Oh, it's your blessing that people like you.

35
00:01:33.366 --> 00:01:35.433
I have a video of your mother

36
00:01:35.466 --> 00:01:36.700
I'm already married.

37
00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.500
I see your whole body can be useless

38
00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.400
Are you going to abort me right away?

39
00:01:40.466 --> 00:01:42.000
Then go to the health bureau for divorce
