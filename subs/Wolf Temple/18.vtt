00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:01.500
But you stinky boy

2
00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:03.500
Secretly married without my consent

3
00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:05.566
Grandpa, can you listen to me explain?

4
00:00:05.566 --> 00:00:07.133
Tomorrow your sister will come to ask questions

5
00:00:07.133 --> 00:00:09.100
Feed yourself

6
00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:10.400
It doesn't make much sense.

7
00:00:11.133 --> 00:00:11.966
OK

8
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:13.466
Who?

9
00:00:14.066 --> 00:00:17.400
The family said my sister wants to see you, so what?

10
00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:18.600
Just your family

11
00:00:18.866 --> 00:00:21.000
I'm afraid my sister will look down on you

12
00:00:22.333 --> 00:00:24.566
Lu Xiu, do you know what you're talking about?

13
00:00:24.566 --> 00:00:27.333
Well, we were just talking about a family

14
00:00:27.333 --> 00:00:29.200
You are a courier.

15
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.000
Don't tell me what kind of rich second generation you are

16
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.966
Come out and experience life as a courier.

17
00:00:33.966 --> 00:00:35.666
Yeah, not bad.

18
00:00:35.866 --> 00:00:37.466
Stop bragging

19
00:00:37.566 --> 00:00:40.500
Don't worry, I won't dislike your family.

20
00:00:41.333 --> 00:00:43.033
When you see my sister, you will know

21
00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:44.766
But then again

22
00:00:44.766 --> 00:00:47.400
Your food is really delicious

23
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.100
Why don't I arrange a restaurant for you to be a chef?

24
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.366
Stop being a courier.

25
00:00:51.366 --> 00:00:54.433
How tiring it is to deliver the courier, how free it is to be a courier?

26
00:00:54.766 --> 00:00:56.133
What if you like my cooking?

27
00:00:56.133 --> 00:00:58.566
I'll just be a chef for you from now on

28
00:00:58.566 --> 00:00:59.400
That's good.

29
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.000
Then you can make a bento and send it to the office tomorrow.

30
00:01:02.933 --> 00:01:03.733
Yes!

31
00:01:07.733 --> 00:01:09.300
Ah Zhangzhou

32
00:01:10.066 --> 00:01:11.766
Don't go in

33
00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:14.366
Why why

34
00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.966
Hey, you don't understand human language

35
00:01:17.966 --> 00:01:19.633
I told you

36
00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.433
This is an upscale office building.

37
00:01:23.066 --> 00:01:26.400
Inferior people are not allowed in

38
00:01:26.566 --> 00:01:27.466
inferior

39
00:01:28.066 --> 00:01:29.700
What the hell are you?

40
00:01:29.766 --> 00:01:32.233
Just randomly divide people into three, six, nine, etc

41
00:01:32.333 --> 00:01:35.866
Hey, a little bit.

42
00:01:36.133 --> 00:01:38.033
Then you really don't understand?

43
00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.166
You are a courier.

44
00:01:40.166 --> 00:01:42.300
I know what you're going in for.

45
00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.066
Who's to lose something?

46
00:01:45.166 --> 00:01:48.500
If you understand human words, get out of here

47
00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:49.400
OK

48
00:01:50.333 --> 00:01:51.566
Then I put things

49
00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:54.000
Just put it in there
