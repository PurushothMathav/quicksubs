00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:02.933
Brother and sister, did you green this fish?

2
00:00:02.933 --> 00:00:04.466
Brother, you misunderstood.

3
00:00:04.466 --> 00:00:06.966
Then how can my wife be like him?

4
00:00:06.966 --> 00:00:08.800
Do that harm?

5
00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:12.266
In fact, the dog meat man was adopted by us.

6
00:00:12.266 --> 00:00:14.200
Then his current life experience

7
00:00:14.533 --> 00:00:17.966
Active adoption doesn't have any origins, right?

8
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.366
I came with a topaz necklace on me.

9
00:00:20.366 --> 00:00:22.266
It sold for about a hundred dollars.

10
00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:23.666
Then why did you adopt him?

11
00:00:23.966 --> 00:00:26.566
There was a feng shui gentleman who said

12
00:00:26.566 --> 00:00:28.800
This little girl can make us lucky at a high price

13
00:00:28.866 --> 00:00:30.200
I adopted it

14
00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:31.433
Take a look now

15
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:32.700
Fucking fooled

16
00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.133
He's a loser

17
00:00:34.133 --> 00:00:35.300
Now what?

18
00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.633
We can't just because he's a bitch

19
00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:40.366
It's not fashionable to offend your neighbor.

20
00:00:40.366 --> 00:00:42.066
We must catch him back

21
00:00:42.066 --> 00:00:43.200
Delivered to Lin Shao

22
00:00:43.266 --> 00:00:45.000
Make him kneel down and apologize to Lin Shao

23
00:00:48.366 --> 00:00:50.100
Hey, it's a bit crude

24
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.033
But you'll be safe with me

25
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:53.866
Thank you. Hi.

26
00:00:53.866 --> 00:00:55.700
It's all a couple, what's there to be polite about?

27
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:01.266
You sleep first and I'll go out

28
00:01:05.533 --> 00:01:06.766
Say Long Shuai

29
00:01:06.766 --> 00:01:08.666
The Longcheng jade pendant you have been looking for has disappeared.

30
00:01:08.666 --> 00:01:09.766
Right at the Black Soldiers

31
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.800
Send me the specific message. Yes.

32
00:01:17.266 --> 00:01:18.633
Hello, is there anyone?

33
00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:19.700
Who?

34
00:01:20.566 --> 00:01:21.833
Honest man, don't talk

35
00:01:23.266 --> 00:01:24.800
Hello sir, I will pick up a courier.

36
00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:25.666
What courier?

37
00:01:25.933 --> 00:01:27.266
Wrong place

38
00:01:27.533 --> 00:01:28.333
i

39
00:01:28.933 --> 00:01:29.733
