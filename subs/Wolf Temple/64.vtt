00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:02.666
Jiangxi, I won't give it to you.

2
00:00:02.733 --> 00:00:05.000
What to give Lu Xiaoke

3
00:00:05.466 --> 00:00:07.600
Who logged out?

4
00:00:07.933 --> 00:00:09.500
It's you who delivered the takeout again

5
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:11.833
I'll tell you what happened today

6
00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:13.400
What the hell is going on?

7
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:15.233
I don't know who he is either.

8
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:16.700
Suddenly appeared at my house

9
00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:18.766
Then I want to point to the transaction records he keeps

10
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.466
Lao Tzu is Lin Weiting

11
00:00:20.766 --> 00:00:22.500
Running away is the son of the richest man

12
00:00:22.566 --> 00:00:23.200
10 years ago

13
00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.266
Where did the gantry rain match for my mortgage apartment go?

14
00:00:25.266 --> 00:00:26.200
Who did you sell it to?

15
00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.166
I tell you to return it to me within a day.

16
00:00:28.166 --> 00:00:30.300
Otherwise, the people from Dragon City didn't come to him.

17
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.700
Tianwang Lao Tzu can't save you either

18
00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:35.000
Are you all right?

19
00:00:36.366 --> 00:00:37.333
Brother mouse, hurry up

20
00:00:37.333 --> 00:00:38.533
Don't have anything to do with me

21
00:00:38.533 --> 00:00:40.100
You will be implicated by me

22
00:00:41.466 --> 00:00:43.766
Is this what you mean?

23
00:00:43.766 --> 00:00:45.000
Where did you steal it from?

24
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Give it back to me

25
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:50.766
This jade pendant is not you

26
00:00:51.266 --> 00:00:52.500
Wang Xiaogang, give it back to him

27
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:53.333
This is Luo Wan jade pendant.

28
00:00:53.333 --> 00:00:54.300
Don't forget to take it.
