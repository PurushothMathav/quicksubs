00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:01.800
Which finger did you point to just now?

2
00:00:02.366 --> 00:00:03.966
Don't you want it anymore?

3
00:00:03.966 --> 00:00:06.233
I packed it, I was wrong, I was wrong.

4
00:00:06.266 --> 00:00:07.200
Stop blocking

5
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.500
If you block it, you will get out.

6
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:10.233
Ok listen to you

7
00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:13.500
Report brother

8
00:00:13.666 --> 00:00:15.700
Hahaha you say you say

9
00:00:16.133 --> 00:00:17.266
Let's leave him alone.

10
00:00:17.266 --> 00:00:18.566
So many people in this company

11
00:00:18.566 --> 00:00:19.900
When the time comes, someone will get up.

12
00:00:20.133 --> 00:00:21.933
Good to hear from you.

13
00:00:21.933 --> 00:00:23.166
You're right. No.

14
00:00:23.533 --> 00:00:26.066
That's love for me, right? Don't be too affectionate

15
00:00:26.066 --> 00:00:27.866
It's to eat in your martial arts project

16
00:00:28.166 --> 00:00:29.166
500 million project

17
00:00:29.266 --> 00:00:31.300
He gave you the 500 million I gave you

18
00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.333
Didn't he give you 500 million project?

19
00:00:33.333 --> 00:00:35.400
That's my own money

20
00:00:35.466 --> 00:00:37.066
You dog

21
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.966
Dare to cheat outside in my name

22
00:00:40.533 --> 00:00:42.300
What are you going to do with him?

23
00:00:42.366 --> 00:00:43.566
The company has a utility supervisor

24
00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:46.866
Just take people in and don't kill them

25
00:00:49.566 --> 00:00:50.400
Don't go

26
00:00:51.166 --> 00:00:54.100
No! I can't go!

27
00:00:55.466 --> 00:00:58.500
Why do you think Xingtian Leopard is so polite to me?

28
00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:59.766
Because he is afraid of me

29
00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.300
And your 500 million project

30
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:02.700
I also asked him to give it to you.

31
00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:03.766
How is that possible?

32
00:01:03.766 --> 00:01:05.300
Don't put gold on your face

33
00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:08.233
I don't want our children to satisfy me in the future

34
00:01:10.133 --> 00:01:12.966
Then why did he give you your project?

35
00:01:13.133 --> 00:01:15.033
Can't it be because of my ability?

36
00:01:20.266 --> 00:01:22.166
Hey, are you back?

37
00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:25.366
I didn't expect you to be such a person

38
00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.466
Sister, don't make trouble, he's my sister

39
00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.200
sister
