00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.466
You are fucking crazy

2
00:00:01.466 --> 00:00:02.933
I can take out 2 billion

3
00:00:02.933 --> 00:00:04.833
Even more money to win the project

4
00:00:05.066 --> 00:00:05.666
According to what I heard

5
00:00:05.666 --> 00:00:08.300
Your neighbors don't seem to have that budget, do they?

6
00:00:09.066 --> 00:00:12.400
Do I have to continue?

7
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:15.400
Wei Ting

8
00:00:15.966 --> 00:00:18.233
How did it go?

9
00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:20.400
2 billion dad

10
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:21.866
Shall we increase the price?

11
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:23.966
Throw this 21

12
00:00:23.966 --> 00:00:27.800
We will not be able to open the turnover according to the group next quarter.

13
00:00:27.866 --> 00:00:29.200
I don't believe it.

14
00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.966
A nameless kid

15
00:00:31.966 --> 00:00:33.866
Where did he get 21?

16
00:00:34.766 --> 00:00:38.500
By the way, isn't there a big shot today?

17
00:00:38.533 --> 00:00:40.533
Are you going to this dealership?

18
00:00:40.533 --> 00:00:42.966
You mean he's the big shot?

19
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.933
If he is really that big shot

20
00:00:45.933 --> 00:00:48.366
You have to get the project out of the way.

21
00:00:48.366 --> 00:00:51.333
Take this opportunity to build relationships

22
00:00:51.333 --> 00:00:53.300
Do you understand? I understand.

23
00:00:54.366 --> 00:00:56.633
Hey, what's going on?

24
00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.166
Do you want to continue adding?

25
00:01:01.166 --> 00:01:04.433
Sir, this 2 billion when you intend to settle

26
00:01:04.666 --> 00:01:06.966
If Mr. Ri can settle 21 now

27
00:01:06.966 --> 00:01:08.366
I immediately got out of the project

28
00:01:08.366 --> 00:01:09.700
I can get it now
