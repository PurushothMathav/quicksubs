00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:01.766
Mom wait a minute

2
00:00:01.966 --> 00:00:05.066
I tell you this marriage, you don't want to marry me every day

3
00:00:05.133 --> 00:00:06.866
I'll call Lin Chao now

4
00:00:11.566 --> 00:00:12.366
Lin Shao

5
00:00:13.066 --> 00:00:13.966
Go go go

6
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.266
Lin Shao, this engagement is coming soon

7
00:00:17.266 --> 00:00:18.933
Let's all pick a good day

8
00:00:18.933 --> 00:00:20.366
Get your marriage license first

9
00:00:20.366 --> 00:00:22.266
The cooperation between our two has not been confirmed

10
00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.100
This marriage can't be decided either

11
00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:24.900
ohm

12
00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.000
It's not that I can't get this project

13
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.300
But I can't take it

14
00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:29.733
The other party is the big shot

15
00:00:29.733 --> 00:00:31.133
I didn't buy the project.

16
00:00:31.133 --> 00:00:33.666
But I have nothing to do with adults anymore

17
00:00:34.166 --> 00:00:35.066
Oh, really?

18
00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.133
Or is the big person's network more important?

19
00:00:38.133 --> 00:00:40.166
Lin Shaoguai is forethought

20
00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:41.800
You really can whistle that!

21
00:00:41.933 --> 00:00:43.566
I saw that big shot with my own eyes

22
00:00:43.566 --> 00:00:44.766
I tore up all your business cards

23
00:00:44.766 --> 00:00:48.000
I don't want to kill you at all

24
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.400
My leader said

25
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:50.166
Just get married

26
00:00:50.166 --> 00:00:52.566
Just hit 300 million to give us a high hair to get through this difficult time

27
00:00:52.566 --> 00:00:54.000
It doesn't matter if he has money or not.

28
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.466
I'll go to bed first

29
00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.133
I don't marry a bitch, if you don't marry me, marry me

30
00:00:58.133 --> 00:00:59.766
Say it 100 times and I won't marry

31
00:01:02.366 --> 00:01:05.533
Yes, our family has been stubborn since childhood

32
00:01:05.533 --> 00:01:06.600
But this woman

33
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.066
It's still easy to coax

34
00:01:08.066 --> 00:01:09.400
You know this life?

35
00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.666
How did the normal criminal do it?

36
00:01:13.966 --> 00:01:15.700
Somebody hold down

37
00:01:18.266 --> 00:01:19.233
Stop
