00:00:01.733 --> 00:00:03.133
What instructions does the old man have?

2
00:00:03.133 --> 00:00:05.500
Brat, I'll send someone to pick you up

3
00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:06.966
Forget it if you don't come back

4
00:00:06.966 --> 00:00:08.766
He actually beat up your senior sister

5
00:00:08.766 --> 00:00:09.733
What do you mean?

6
00:00:09.733 --> 00:00:11.033
How dare I hit him?

7
00:00:11.333 --> 00:00:13.366
He hit me first

8
00:00:13.366 --> 00:00:14.500
I can't control you.

9
00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:16.200
But there will be a auction tonight.

10
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.200
The Lingjia of Heijiang City also went

11
00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.566
Lingjia, you must take the project down

12
00:00:20.566 --> 00:00:21.700
I'll give you a billion first

13
00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:22.933
If it's not enough, ask me for it again.

14
00:00:22.933 --> 00:00:24.666
No, you owe me something

15
00:00:24.666 --> 00:00:25.600
Wait for my good news.

16
00:00:41.966 --> 00:00:43.900
Yo Li Shao, how did you come here?

17
00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:45.200
Inside please inside please

18
00:00:46.766 --> 00:00:49.400
Is Ruonan at home? Yes, yes.

19
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.766
Ruonan, Ruonan, come out quickly

20
00:00:51.766 --> 00:00:52.700
Come on

21
00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:53.700
I'm wearing a contract today

22
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.400
Lihe and the invitation to the auction tonight

23
00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:56.866
Letter and Liv

24
00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:58.000
I would like to invite

25
00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.566
Come on, ladies

26
00:00:58.566 --> 00:01:00.366
Join me at tonight's auction

27
00:01:00.366 --> 00:01:02.800
Mr. Lin, I'm a little uncomfortable today

28
00:01:02.933 --> 00:01:05.200
What are you thinking about if you don't want to go?

29
00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.666
You dare to pretend that you are so little

30
00:01:07.666 --> 00:01:08.966
I want your dad to shit

31
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.466
Lin Shao, he's alright

32
00:01:11.466 --> 00:01:12.666
Just rest.

33
00:01:12.666 --> 00:01:14.866
I have to deliver it to him tonight

34
00:01:15.766 --> 00:01:16.366
Lin Shao

35
00:01:16.366 --> 00:01:19.133
You seem certain to win tonight's bidding

36
00:01:19.133 --> 00:01:20.233
Of course!

37
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.700
My neighbor is the richest man in Heijiang City

38
00:01:22.733 --> 00:01:23.866
Doesn't look like it to me?

39
00:01:23.866 --> 00:01:25.066
No one can take it from me

40
00:01:25.066 --> 00:01:27.666
I'm going to film this new project tonight

41
00:01:27.666 --> 00:01:29.000
I'll give it to you as a betrothal gift.

42
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.766
Look at Lin Shao

43
00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.100
How sincere is that?

44
00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.700
If the bid is unsuccessful

45
00:01:33.966 --> 00:01:36.166
Can our engagement be cancelled?
