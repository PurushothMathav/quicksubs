00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:01.933
Sister, make it clear

2
00:00:01.933 --> 00:00:02.700
So what's going on?

3
00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.166
Tan Guohua uses your pawn shop

4
00:00:04.166 --> 00:00:05.233
Conduct black transactions

5
00:00:05.566 --> 00:00:07.300
If the transaction records can be found

6
00:00:07.466 --> 00:00:08.433
He must go to jail

7
00:00:08.533 --> 00:00:09.600
Are you sure?

8
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:11.966
Yes, as long as the transaction chain can be found

9
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.433
Shunteng can uproot the Tang family by scraping it

10
00:00:15.666 --> 00:00:16.933
Do you mean to say

11
00:00:16.933 --> 00:00:18.866
The Tang family deliberately created this accident

12
00:00:18.866 --> 00:00:20.333
Just to destroy the evidence

13
00:00:20.333 --> 00:00:21.233
Exactly.

14
00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.033
Can you send me the transaction record?

15
00:00:26.533 --> 00:00:29.166
Can you give me the transaction records one by one?

16
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.033
Brother Lu, except for his parents

17
00:00:34.133 --> 00:00:35.466
You are the best to me.

18
00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.000
I believe you.

19
00:00:37.166 --> 00:00:39.100
If you came to kill me too

20
00:00:39.533 --> 00:00:41.233
I admit strange

21
00:00:41.733 --> 00:00:43.600
Obviously my classmate

22
00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.233
When did he get along so well with Lu Xiao?

23
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.900
Silly boy don't think too much

24
00:00:49.166 --> 00:00:50.366
Get well

25
00:00:51.333 --> 00:00:53.400
Brother Jiu, I had a car accident.

26
00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:56.966
Hey, are you here?

27
00:00:56.966 --> 00:00:57.800
That's fine.

28
00:00:58.266 --> 00:01:00.300
What third wife, please explain it to me clearly

29
00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.900
Uh uh uh I was wrong about that

30
00:01:05.966 --> 00:01:07.400
It's mine, my three elders

31
00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:08.866
Who is your third wife?

32
00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.266
By the way, what's going on, rice?

33
00:01:13.333 --> 00:01:14.933
Didn't I ask you to protect Shen Yiyi?

34
00:01:14.933 --> 00:01:16.166
How could anything happen?

35
00:01:16.166 --> 00:01:19.700
It's that Tang Guohua. I can't respond to him looking for trouble.

36
00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.700
He has this Dragon City as his backer

37
00:01:22.266 --> 00:01:24.600
Honestly, which side are you helping?
