1
00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:02.166
Doctor, what should my mother do?

2
00:00:02.166 --> 00:00:03.400
What pain insurance?

3
00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:05.066
Mrs. Jing is not seriously injured

4
00:00:06.066 --> 00:00:08.033
But he was diagnosed with blood cancer

5
00:00:08.266 --> 00:00:10.833
Blood cancer, also known as leukemia

6
00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:12.100
The situation cannot be ignored

7
00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:14.100
May require a hand-donated bone marrow

8
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:15.866
Doctor, I'm his daughter

9
00:00:15.866 --> 00:00:17.866
See if my bone marrow matches his

10
00:00:17.866 --> 00:00:19.800
Don't he get pregnant?

11
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:20.833
Ask other family members

12
00:00:22.866 --> 00:00:25.700
Not fragrant if only my bone marrow matches mom

13
00:00:25.866 --> 00:00:27.600
Then we also have other ifs

14
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.233
You're not that bad?

15
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.900
Why did Qin Guilan treat you like this before?

16
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:35.266
So concerned about his life and death

17
00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.700
Go answer the phone

18
00:00:41.666 --> 00:00:44.500
The old man is too aggrieved that the black zombie can't move

19
00:00:44.666 --> 00:00:46.433
Can you restore my status as a marshal?

20
00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.066
Wu Qi, you are my grandson

21
00:00:48.066 --> 00:00:49.666
Dragon City is not convinced

22
00:00:49.666 --> 00:00:51.000
Think you are incapable

23
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.266
It's all about relationships

24
00:00:52.266 --> 00:00:53.900
As long as you complete this task

25
00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.766
I will naturally help you with kung fu. Okay, I received it.

26
00:01:00.933 --> 00:01:01.966
30 cars on their own

27
00:01:01.966 --> 00:01:03.966
The operating room is ahead, hurry up, hurry up
