00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.800
Who are you?

2
00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:13.966
Let go of me!

3
00:00:14.966 --> 00:00:15.766
Ah!

4
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.500
Who are you, beautiful woman, help me

5
00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.600
Ah, I remember now.

6
00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:30.533
You were in the wrong room that night

7
00:00:30.533 --> 00:00:31.366
It landed on me.

8
00:00:31.366 --> 00:00:33.100
I'm also responsible for this

9
00:00:34.166 --> 00:00:34.966
Hey

10
00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.666
Oh, that child is really mine.

11
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.566
Only make jokes about this kind of thing

12
00:00:39.933 --> 00:00:41.766
If it were my child, I would definitely be responsible

13
00:00:42.266 --> 00:00:43.500
Just be willing to take responsibility

14
00:00:43.566 --> 00:00:46.233
Go to the Civil Affairs Bureau to get the certificate.

15
00:00:46.666 --> 00:00:48.133
I'm just saying I'm responsible for the child

16
00:00:48.133 --> 00:00:49.700
I never said I would marry you

17
00:00:49.866 --> 00:00:51.566
Those conditions are beautiful

18
00:00:52.066 --> 00:00:53.400
Is he worthy of it?

19
00:00:53.533 --> 00:00:54.566
That's hard to say.

20
00:00:54.566 --> 00:00:55.266
Didn't you see it?

21
00:00:55.266 --> 00:00:56.800
A group of people just called him a god

22
00:00:59.133 --> 00:01:01.166
You've thought about it, don't regret it.

23
00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:02.700
I've figured it out.

24
00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:04.566
But I respect your understanding.

25
00:01:04.933 --> 00:01:06.100
Civil Affairs Bureau

26
00:01:06.133 --> 00:01:06.966
Hospital hard work
