When I was a kid, I wanted to buy a box of colored pencils.

2
00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:09.566
Dad didn't buy it for you

3
00:00:09.566 --> 00:00:11.433
Because you are adopted

4
00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:13.800
Your dad is a bad gambler

5
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.233
Picked up a butt before going home

6
00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:20.466
Mom, stop talking, I never hurt you.

7
00:00:20.466 --> 00:00:21.900
Never loved you

8
00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.633
You know I'm not your mother

9
00:00:25.066 --> 00:00:27.233
I never had children.

10
00:00:27.533 --> 00:00:31.466
If only you were my own

11
00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:40.400
Mom, don't say so much

12
00:00:40.466 --> 00:00:41.666
You take good care

13
00:00:41.666 --> 00:00:43.800
I will definitely find a way to save you.

14
00:00:43.966 --> 00:00:47.066
Mom can't take it anymore

15
00:00:47.533 --> 00:00:48.700
Teacher brother

16
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:50.433
Mom

17
00:00:52.533 --> 00:00:54.366
Then I have a few diseases

18
00:00:58.066 --> 00:01:02.033
Yes, Mom.

19
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.033
Mom Doctor 50
