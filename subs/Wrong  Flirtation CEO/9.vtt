00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.020
Ah what are you doing

2
00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:09.299
Go to sleep!

3
00:00:09.299 --> 00:00:12.560
But people are not ready

4
00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:14.540
I sleep on the sofa and you sleep on the bed

5
00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:16.760
If you're not ready

6
00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:18.620
Just me on the bed, you on the sofa

7
00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:20.024
We are ready.

8
00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:23.260
Good night Macabacca

9
00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.740
Jewelry design for Imperial Heart

10
00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.860
It turns out that Li Zeyan's design skills are so powerful

11
00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.700
Sure enough, serious men are the most handsome.

12
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:49.960
Miss Su

13
00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:51.140
What do you want?

14
00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.420
I'm looking at your design draft, how about it?

15
00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:58.180
general

16
00:01:04.833 --> 00:01:04.934
It's average there.

17
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:09.860
bastard

18
00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:16.220
Grandpa deliberately made the city full of storms

19
00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.180
Do you want me to promise you to marry her?

20
00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:20.340
Grandpa

21
00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.733
I already told you

22
00:01:22.733 --> 00:01:23.600
I want to marry her

23
00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.020
But you don't promise me

24
00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:34.700
Get engaged

25
00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.533
Our Li family can't afford to lose face

26
00:01:38.533 --> 00:01:38.940
Yes!

27
00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.820
Young Master Li is too affectionate

28
00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.720
Even I almost believed it

29
00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.740
But don't forget

30
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.260
We're just in a contractual marriage, right?

31
00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:53.520
OK

32
00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:55.760
It's not that you're too tempting

33
00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:58.420
I almost wanted to fake it

34
00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.540
I dare not, but

35
00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.380
I will do what I promised you

36
00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:05.560
Then it depends on your performance

37
00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.940
What are you going to do next?

38
00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:17.340
Of course, by making the Su Group ours

39
00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:24.900
You can't take away every stitch and thread of the Su family and search them.
