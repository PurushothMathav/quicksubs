00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:03.360
How did it go?

2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.300
It looks good, the flowers look good, or I look good.

3
00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:11.100
I'm talking about good-looking books.

4
00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:13.699
Dangtang Li's President

5
00:00:13.699 --> 00:00:15.880
Pick flowers and give them to your sweetheart

6
00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:18.000
You told me it was a good book

7
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.460
Let me see how good it looks.

8
00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:21.232
Dangtang Li's President

9
00:00:21.232 --> 00:00:23.100
I'm actually jealous of a book

10
00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:23.766
spread out

11
00:00:23.766 --> 00:00:25.499
Not afraid of being laughed at

12
00:00:25.499 --> 00:00:27.060
It's not because you snubbed me

13
00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.520
I didn't mean to

14
00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:31.160
Just took over the Su Group

15
00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.120
I have to learn a lot every day

16
00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.940
I'm stressed out.

17
00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.100
Otherwise you kiss me

18
00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:38.900
I'll help you take charge of Su's

19
00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:40.233
No.

20
00:00:40.233 --> 00:00:41.060
Dear

21
00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:41.766
No.

22
00:00:41.766 --> 00:00:43.880
Su's Group surname Su

23
00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:46.460
Su Yaoan's Su ah

24
00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:47.700
Su Yaoan's Su

25
00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:50.460
Million orders from Nali Group

26
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.700
Can the pressure on the Lower Su Group be relieved?

27
00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:57.800
100 million

28
00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:59.140
200 million

29
00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:00.366
300 million

30
00:01:00.366 --> 00:01:02.420
No going back is allowed.

31
00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.140
Three 300 million

32
00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:05.260
I regretted it.

33
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.140
I'll change it to a billion

34
00:01:23.233 --> 00:01:23.699
Yaoyao

35
00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.000
Will you marry me?

36
00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:31.620
I will love you with all my life

37
00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:33.460
Regardless of birth, old age, illness and death

38
00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:34.460
Forever

39
00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:36.900
Forever

40
00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:54.666
end of the play
