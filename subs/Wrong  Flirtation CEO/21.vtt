00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.166
Who is she?

2
00:00:01.166 --> 00:00:03.780
She is Chen Jingmeng, Chief Li's psychiatrist

3
00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:08.460
How did I forget the lace news about Li Zeyan in Chen Jingmeng's last life

4
00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:10.232
Nine of the ten are her

5
00:00:10.232 --> 00:00:10.620
Everyone

6
00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.180
Li Zeyan has always had mental illness

7
00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:15.860
Because when he was young

8
00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:18.499
Killed his own brother

9
00:00:18.499 --> 00:00:18.566
What

10
00:00:23.266 --> 00:00:24.514
What? Li Zeyan killed his own brother

11
00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:27.520
That's it

12
00:00:28.333 --> 00:00:29.066
It's terrible

13
00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:31.140
Shut up, Li Yuan

14
00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:34.120
At least Zeyan is your cousin

15
00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:35.260
Dear cousin

16
00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:39.580
15 years ago, you pushed your own brother downstairs and fell to his death

17
00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.080
You have a fear of heights

18
00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:46.260
I have been receiving treatment with your psychiatrist, Miss Chen Jingmeng, for all these years, right?

19
00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:50.280
I am Chen Jingmeng, a graduate of Princeton University in psychology

20
00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.740
He is also Mr. Li Zeyan's psychiatrist

21
00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.340
No, it's fine

22
00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.940
Let her speak

23
00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:59.740
Mr. Li Zeyan has no sleep except insomnia

24
00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.860
There is no mental illness

25
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:03.600
You lie

26
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.133
He lost his temper on the rooftop that day

27
00:01:05.133 --> 00:01:08.580
All the media have photographed it, people without training

28
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.520
Under the strong flash

29
00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.520
It is normal for the body to feel unwell

30
00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.620
I swear by my career

31
00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.180
Mr. Li Zeyan

32
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.900
What are you doing when you don't have any psychological problems

33
00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.020
Take this beast down to me

34
00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.060
Let me go, Li Zeyan, you wait for me

35
00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.720
Chen Jingmeng gambled her career for Li Zeyan

36
00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.120
Is it true that they were lovers as rumors say

37
00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.840
What's wrong with you, Yaoyao

38
00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:33.640
Are you uncomfortable?

39
00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:34.560
This is the case

40
00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:35.899
I can't be distracted anymore

41
00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:38.160
It's time for my well-prepared show

42
00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.666
Everyone

43
00:01:38.666 --> 00:01:42.920
A little bit of interlude, everyone knows that I am the eldest daughter of the Su family

44
00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:43.880
Much loved

45
00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.140
So I married Li Zeyan today

46
00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.860
My mother also specially prepared a generous dowry for me

47
00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:51.900
Please take a look

48
00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.300
Isn't this the necklace I asked Lao Wang to send to the black market for auction?

49
00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:03.860
Why is it here?

50
00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.480
How did the necklace I handed you get to Su Yaoan?

51
00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:08.600
Madam, our business

52
00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:09.980
The eldest lady knows

53
00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.180
Someone came, the second lady of the Su family fell down the stairwell and passed out

54
00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.560
Tian Tian
