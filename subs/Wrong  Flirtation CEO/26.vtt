00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.900
Yaoyao hold on Yaoyao

2
00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:05.420
Don't leave me

3
00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:09.420
Don't leave me, I don't want to move Yaoyao

4
00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:13.180
Brother Yan, Brother Yan

5
00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:18.080
original

6
00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:21.820
We've known each other for so long

7
00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:35.540
Yaoyao, you are awake

8
00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:39.820
I'm so afraid of losing you again, again

9
00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:45.466
Why didn't you tell me?

10
00:00:45.466 --> 00:00:46.720
You are Brother Yan

11
00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:48.060
You remember

12
00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.040
When did you remember?

13
00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:51.840
When I saw that necklace

14
00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.400
You want me to be your wife?

15
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.220
Empire Star is no small matter

16
00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.940
So you didn't marry me for cooperation at all

17
00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.220
Still the same as when I was a kid

18
00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:03.320
One wood

19
00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.999
If a big man were known to you

20
00:01:05.999 --> 00:01:08.180
I still remember the promise I made when I was a child

21
00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:09.040
that

22
00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:10.500
Is it shameful to lose?

23
00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:11.766
It's embarrassing

24
00:01:11.766 --> 00:01:12.700
Even if ashamed

25
00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:14.180
I also admit

26
00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.140
I've always wanted to marry you since I was a kid

27
00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.020
I have been tortured by heart disease all these years.

28
00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:21.940
I can only bury this wish in my heart

29
00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:25.600
Thank goodness.

30
00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.580
Bring you back to me

31
00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.980
Don't ever leave me again, okay?

32
00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:33.220
Am I interrupting?

33
00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:36.600
Good to know

34
00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.620
Miss Su, this is a gift from my boyfriend and I to you.

35
00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:41.100
Hope you get well soon.

36
00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.080
Boyfriend, right?

37
00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:44.866
It was Mr. Li who sponsored me to go to college

38
00:01:44.866 --> 00:01:46.040
That's why I help them.

39
00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:47.140
Now, don't get me wrong.

40
00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:50.420
Don't be jealous now

41
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.980
Is anyone jealous?

42
00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.000
No, I don't.

43
00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.400
Zhou Mei, how is she now?

44
00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:58.620
Zhou Mei is crazy

45
00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:00.580
She actually left a suicide note to kill herself

46
00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.980
He donated his heart to Su Sitian

47
00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.799
Su Sitian woke up and learned the truth

48
00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:06.460
Also crazy

49
00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:07.720
OK

50
00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.820
Zhou Mei is evil

51
00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:12.780
But she was a wonderful mother.

52
00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.333
3 300 million

53
00:02:15.333 --> 00:02:16.700
Well, I regretted it.

54
00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:22.580
I'll change it to a billion
