00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:03.466
What's the fire?

2
00:00:03.466 --> 00:00:05.740
We haven't lost yet, we haven't lost yet

3
00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:07.880
Aren't you great when you sleep with me?

4
00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:10.280
Why can't Li Zeyan move a hair now?

5
00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:12.900
How dare you look down on me?

6
00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.340
Don't take me for a sick cat like He Feiyu, it pisses me off

7
00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.132
I can't get Li Zeyan, and I can't get you

8
00:00:20.132 --> 00:00:20.780
Oh, dear.

9
00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.400
I'm just being angry and playing petty

10
00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.160
How can He Feiyu compare to you?

11
00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:28.720
You are a famous son

12
00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:30.900
He is the mud under your feet.

13
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.020
Dear

14
00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.900
We shouldn't do anything now

15
00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:41.960
Grandpa is still angry

16
00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:43.160
I'll ask for forgiveness first

17
00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.300
You go back to the banquet hall to see Li Zeyan first

18
00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:57.132
Bad you, dare to betray me and die

19
00:01:00.652 --> 00:01:02.384
Tian Tian

20
00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:07.800
How is my daughter, miss? It's just a head injury

21
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.740
But she fell down the stairs, terrified.

22
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:10.720
heart attack recurrence

23
00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.260
We need a transplant as soon as possible

24
00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:14.200
Then you hurry up and arrange the surgery

25
00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.400
It's hard to find a match

26
00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:16.580
The hospital will do its best.

27
00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:21.280
Tian Tian

28
00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.340
He Feiyu made you like this

29
00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.460
Mom will definitely let him sit in jail

30
00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:30.040
Hey I'm busy

31
00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:30.599
Don't look for it

32
00:01:30.599 --> 00:01:33.080
Madam, otherwise Su's Jewelry Store would have been seized for black market transactions

33
00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:34.266
Now the group stock market has plummeted

34
00:01:34.266 --> 00:01:35.040
Capital chain broken

35
00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.166
Ma'am, we're finished.

36
00:01:36.166 --> 00:01:37.100
How could this be?

37
00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:42.900
Su Yaoan

38
00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:44.960
You destroyed the Su family

39
00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:46.620
You ruined Tian Tian

40
00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:48.480
Ha ha.

41
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:50.800
Tian Tian

42
00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.300
Mom thought about it

43
00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:56.540
Whose heart are you going to dig?

44
00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.100
To heal you

45
00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.060
Don't worry.

46
00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.820
Revenge succeeded

47
00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.300
But why is it not as happy as imagined?

48
00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.060
The two of them are together

49
00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.740
Now it's all over

50
00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:24.540
Should I return Li Zeyan to Miss Chen?

51
00:02:28.933 --> 00:02:29.400
Zhou Mei

52
00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.340
Su Yaoan, let's meet. Is there still a need for me to meet you?

53
00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:36.340
What about your mother's ashes?

54
00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.020
I just had to pour it down the toilet and flush it away

55
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.860
Where are you?

56
00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.620
Zhou Mei, don't go too far

57
00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:49.620
If you don't want to die, give me back my mother's urn

58
00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:53.420
Ok, I'll give it back to you now.

59
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.260
What do you want?
