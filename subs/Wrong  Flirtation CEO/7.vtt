00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:01.540
I'm so cold

2
00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:04.066
What's up?

3
00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.620
My chest hurts, your chest hurts

4
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:10.580
I'll take you to the hospital

5
00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:12.700
Don't go to the hospital

6
00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:22.080
Mr. Li

7
00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:25.080
go out

8
00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.500
Li Zeyan is so handsome

9
00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:51.020
No, why am I here?

10
00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:54.480
Are you a kettle?

11
00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.020
So loud

12
00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.120
You bully me

13
00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.860
Don't be bloody

14
00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:03.360
I watched over you all night

15
00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:05.180
You haven't touched a finger

16
00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:07.020
What is this?

17
00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.780
Miss Ben is a lively beauty

18
00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:11.820
He was indifferent

19
00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.300
Young Master Li will not be so calm now, right?

20
00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:33.500
Su Yaoan

21
00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.740
No matter how graceful I am

22
00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.340
I am also a man

23
00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:39.500
You have to seduce me like this again

24
00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.060
At your own risk

25
00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:43.000
I know, you let me go first

26
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.300
I was kidding.

27
00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:45.900
Dare to provoke me again

28
00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.820
Next time it won't be so easy to let you go

29
00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.000
OK

30
00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.580
Well, why don't you eat it? Look at how you eat

31
00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.660
Full, what Brother Zeyan means is

32
00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:13.340
See how happy I am eating, you are already very satisfied

33
00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.399
I went through such a bad thing yesterday

34
00:02:16.399 --> 00:02:17.940
Thank you for having such a good appetite

35
00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:19.620
My mom died a long time ago

36
00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:21.660
My dad passed away a few years ago

37
00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:23.820
Making a living at the hands of a stepmother

38
00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.366
Bad things happen every day

39
00:02:25.366 --> 00:02:27.700
If I didn't eat, I would have starved to death

40
00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:42.020
Excuse me?

41
00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.840
I am more protective of food

42
00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.140
Don't be embarrassed.

43
00:02:47.266 --> 00:02:47.813
continue

44
00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:51.600
The head of the Li family is mine

45
00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.300
You are mine too

46
00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.166
Do you know what the flower language of hydrangea is?

47
00:02:56.166 --> 00:02:56.740
Is a trap
