00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:03.100
Jiro, are you hallucinating from taking medicine?

2
00:00:03.133 --> 00:00:04.400
The interests of Aolong and BDO

3
00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:05.900
Why park you in the car?

4
00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:07.666
It doesn't matter if it's R & D, right?

5
00:00:07.666 --> 00:00:09.766
Their company is engaged in micro-revolution

6
00:00:09.766 --> 00:00:10.466
Very likely

7
00:00:10.466 --> 00:00:11.133
Mr. Cai Tian

8
00:00:11.133 --> 00:00:13.066
We have no business selling adult drugs.

9
00:00:13.066 --> 00:00:15.233
You should sell your medicine to others.

10
00:00:15.466 --> 00:00:18.166
But if it's ecstasy

11
00:00:18.166 --> 00:00:19.966
Is it the antidote to tiger umbrella?

12
00:00:19.966 --> 00:00:21.800
Ah golden tasteless ecstasy

13
00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.500
Master Shi, this guy dares to go up

14
00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:24.300
Ahhhhhh

15
00:00:24.366 --> 00:00:25.166
Ahhhhh

16
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:25.966
Ahhhh!

17
00:00:25.966 --> 00:00:27.433
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah

18
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:28.833
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah

19
00:00:29.066 --> 00:00:29.866
Ahhhhh

20
00:00:30.133 --> 00:00:31.300
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah

21
00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:33.600
Ah!

22
00:00:34.866 --> 00:00:37.100
I actually didn't put down my principles in advance

23
00:00:37.266 --> 00:00:38.400
You are so despicable.

24
00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.933
It doesn't require us to succeed or fail, it's just the process

25
00:00:41.933 --> 00:00:43.733
It's the outcome that matters.

26
00:00:43.733 --> 00:00:46.000
Who let you guys do business?

27
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.366
Don't leave a play for yourself

28
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.000
Blame me for taking a screenshot halfway.

29
00:00:49.933 --> 00:00:51.200
Hurry up and notify the whole family

30
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.600
Only he can handle this guy

31
00:00:58.366 --> 00:00:59.866
The signal is blocked

32
00:01:00.133 --> 00:01:03.000
Ouch, I can't type it out, hahaha.

33
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.666
We all attract people to do things, and no water will flow.

34
00:01:06.666 --> 00:01:10.200
How could I possibly give you a chance to meet outside?

35
00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.066
Hahaha

36
00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:18.166
Get everyone to hand in books

37
00:01:18.166 --> 00:01:19.500
Stunned after paying the money

38
00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.166
Wave down more than ten two waters and the antidote and throw it away

39
00:01:24.466 --> 00:01:25.266
Let's go

40
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.366
Spring Rain told you

41
00:01:28.366 --> 00:01:30.566
Who is so beautiful?

42
00:01:30.733 --> 00:01:35.400
Hey, it's a pity to just extort some money

43
00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:41.033
Hey, hey, why don't you let me take some more cigarette pictures?

44
00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:42.866
Hahaha
