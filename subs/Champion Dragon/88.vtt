1
00:00:00.066 --> 00:00:02.300
Not just go to the meeting

2
00:00:02.333 --> 00:00:03.300
How courageous!

3
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.966
Since you and I must have a battle in Jinghai

4
00:00:05.966 --> 00:00:07.866
Then there's no need to procrastinate

5
00:00:07.866 --> 00:00:10.000
He Yangmu, you obviously heard it

6
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.566
Long Shuai has not yet recovered his skills

7
00:00:11.566 --> 00:00:13.100
So dare to appear

8
00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:15.733
How can a despicable villain like you be a hero?

9
00:00:15.733 --> 00:00:17.866
Shameless to restore the enemy's skills

10
00:00:18.133 --> 00:00:19.800
It's like cutting yourself off from the grave

11
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:20.733
Sun Baitian

12
00:00:20.733 --> 00:00:23.466
You've been out of business for years and your brain has been damaged

13
00:00:23.466 --> 00:00:26.633
I don't even understand this superficial truth

14
00:00:27.766 --> 00:00:29.666
Hou Yangmu, come on

15
00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.366
Today you and I only have one.

16
00:00:32.366 --> 00:00:34.200
Can you leave Jinghai alive?

17
00:00:34.266 --> 00:00:36.466
Long Shuai, I have a proposal

18
00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:37.733
Would you consider

19
00:00:37.733 --> 00:00:38.733
What other tricks do you want to play?

20
00:00:38.733 --> 00:00:41.800
You know why I planned it in the first place

21
00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.100
Do you want to get rid of Cao Lin?

22
00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.000
Hmph, why else?

23
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.766
It's just that you are too selfish

24
00:00:46.766 --> 00:00:47.666
Want to swallow

25
00:00:47.666 --> 00:00:48.800
You're wrong.

26
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.200
Cao Lin himself wants to ascend the throne

27
00:00:51.333 --> 00:00:53.700
Take yourself too seriously

28
00:00:54.266 --> 00:00:55.066
Poplar

29
00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.000
I'm not interested in that

30
00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.133
You don't have to talk too much

31
00:00:59.133 --> 00:01:00.600
I'm going to cut this short.

32
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:01.366
otherwise

33
00:01:01.366 --> 00:01:04.200
How about you and I share the country after I board the plane?

34
00:01:05.933 --> 00:01:07.566
You want to pull the dragon boat to rebel together

35
00:01:07.566 --> 00:01:09.100
It's a good deal.

36
00:01:09.133 --> 00:01:11.200
Poplar, you should know very well

37
00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.366
There is no way I can agree to your request.

38
00:01:13.366 --> 00:01:14.166
Liang Fan

39
00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:15.800
You are willing

40
00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.066
To be a dog of a waste country lord?

41
00:01:18.066 --> 00:01:19.666
I never thought about starting my own business

42
00:01:19.666 --> 00:01:21.633
Take the hero to the next level
