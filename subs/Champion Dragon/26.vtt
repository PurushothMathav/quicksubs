00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:06.066
fuck

2
00:00:08.366 --> 00:00:10.266
Jiro, aren't you a TV series ninja?

3
00:00:10.266 --> 00:00:12.233
Why are you panicking now?

4
00:00:15.133 --> 00:00:16.000
Don't scare me!

5
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.666
I'll give you all my money.

6
00:00:17.666 --> 00:00:18.666
I don't want money.

7
00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:20.866
I need something special I don't buy unreal

8
00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:22.566
That's not what I'm talking about.

9
00:00:22.566 --> 00:00:24.533
Do you know a person named Cao Ling?

10
00:00:24.533 --> 00:00:25.533
What's your relationship with him?

11
00:00:25.533 --> 00:00:27.733
Cao Ling, his general

12
00:00:27.733 --> 00:00:29.900
I only know that he is at the frontier

13
00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:31.466
But your ninja god

14
00:00:31.466 --> 00:00:32.700
But it has something to do with him

15
00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.800
Are you sure you don't know Cao Ling's bodyguard?

16
00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.900
I just brought a bunch of ninja sisters to talk about shame

17
00:00:38.933 --> 00:00:41.833
Ninjas are our high expectations

18
00:00:41.866 --> 00:00:43.700
Ninja Stop Success Fail Luxury

19
00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.033
You must be recruiting depositors.

20
00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:47.933
Then you are useless

21
00:00:47.933 --> 00:00:48.866
Wait a minute.

22
00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:51.566
Ah, what are you in a hurry?

23
00:00:51.566 --> 00:00:53.366
He hasn't lifted the seal for me yet

24
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.400
I'm sorry I'm fast

25
00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:57.800
Let's talk about the seal

26
00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.066
You creepy little creep

27
00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:01.900
First let me fish for law enforcement

28
00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:04.133
Now you break your promise and don't lift the seal for me

29
00:01:04.133 --> 00:01:05.533
Did I apologize to you?

30
00:01:05.533 --> 00:01:06.733
I'm a little faster

31
00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:08.733
I will help you find a way to lift the seal.

32
00:01:08.733 --> 00:01:10.100
Yes or no?

33
00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:11.700
I know I'm not as good as you

34
00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.400
But I have my way

35
00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:14.833
Is for you to keep your promise

36
00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.700
Ouch me

37
00:01:26.533 --> 00:01:27.666
How is Mr. Gao?

38
00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.000
Ah, why is Liao Fantian bleeding?

39
00:01:32.666 --> 00:01:34.266
What just happened?
