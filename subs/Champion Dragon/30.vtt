00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:05.766
Mr. Gao, how did you get my contact information?

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.833
It's just a look at the growth king impact

3
00:00:09.466 --> 00:00:11.566
I heard you are a ninja.

4
00:00:11.566 --> 00:00:12.766
It used to be.

5
00:00:12.766 --> 00:00:15.700
Now she's just a cleaning girl

6
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:18.633
I'll give you 10 million

7
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.300
You do something for me

8
00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:24.066
Is it dangerous to kill the mission at such a high price?

9
00:00:24.766 --> 00:00:25.966
Help me investigate

10
00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.700
Who are the miserable parties in the grass forest in Jinhai?

11
00:00:28.866 --> 00:00:30.066
After the event

12
00:00:30.066 --> 00:00:31.500
I'll give you another money.

13
00:00:31.533 --> 00:00:33.000
Entrust you to kill them all

14
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.666
What if I don't pick it up?

15
00:00:36.933 --> 00:00:38.166
one person

16
00:00:38.166 --> 00:00:39.500
Are you still afraid of death?

17
00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.466
Don't use the aggressive method for me

18
00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:42.366
I don't want money.

19
00:00:42.366 --> 00:00:44.300
I want another thing

20
00:00:44.666 --> 00:00:47.700
Said when I got the list

21
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.166
Come back and negotiate terms with you

22
00:00:49.166 --> 00:00:50.166
Wait for my message.

23
00:00:53.466 --> 00:00:55.600
The next person who can avenge me

24
00:00:55.766 --> 00:00:57.266
It should be Liao Fan

25
00:00:59.166 --> 00:01:01.400
Mr. Gao, I said that you can pay my salary.

26
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:02.766
I'm just your bodyguard

27
00:01:02.766 --> 00:01:04.366
But not to be a killer for you

28
00:01:04.366 --> 00:01:06.300
Not all part-time workers come out to make money

29
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.666
You don't care about this 10 million

30
00:01:08.733 --> 00:01:10.800
Looks like I'm going to grab it again

31
00:01:11.366 --> 00:01:12.966
I know you have two strokes

32
00:01:12.966 --> 00:01:14.766
30 million in this card

33
00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:17.366
Give it all whether it succeeds or fails

34
00:01:17.366 --> 00:01:18.933
As long as you can help me get revenge

35
00:01:18.933 --> 00:01:20.933
Mr. Gao, you can't get involved

36
00:01:20.933 --> 00:01:22.433
I wouldn't do such a thing either.

37
00:01:23.166 --> 00:01:24.266
Don't dare or can't

38
00:01:24.266 --> 00:01:26.466
Could it be that you are one of the remnants of Cao Lin?

39
00:01:26.466 --> 00:01:28.333
How could I possibly be one of the remnants?

40
00:01:28.333 --> 00:01:29.666
I'm just your bodyguard

41
00:01:29.666 --> 00:01:31.800
Don't force me to report you to Chen Zhan

42
00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.766
Let the military torture you

43
00:01:33.766 --> 00:01:34.533
That is nothing to talk about

44
00:01:34.533 --> 00:01:35.966
Bodyguards are just your profession

45
00:01:35.966 --> 00:01:38.233
And I'm using money to buy your integrity now

46
00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:39.800
Just avenge me

47
00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.600
Stay if you promise

48
00:01:41.733 --> 00:01:43.766
Resign if you don't agree
