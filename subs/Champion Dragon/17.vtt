00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:02.333
First question.

2
00:00:02.333 --> 00:00:03.900
Who is your leader?

3
00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:07.866
I'm telling you, you better cooperate

4
00:00:07.866 --> 00:00:09.966
Otherwise, I'm going to use Soul Searchers

5
00:00:09.966 --> 00:00:11.300
It's not that I don't say

6
00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:12.266
Is our leader

7
00:00:12.266 --> 00:00:14.600
A seal is etched on each of us

8
00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:17.166
If I confess crucial information

9
00:00:17.166 --> 00:00:18.500
Or you use Soul Searchers

10
00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:20.700
I get a cold attack

11
00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:22.333
Immediately die

12
00:00:22.333 --> 00:00:25.166
How about Jin Xian's cunning Dong Yushen Senior Sister?

13
00:00:25.166 --> 00:00:27.333
Shen Da caught a trash

14
00:00:27.333 --> 00:00:28.600
He has the seal of cold poison on him

15
00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:29.566
Can't say anything

16
00:00:29.566 --> 00:00:31.433
And there's no way to use Soul Searchers

17
00:00:32.466 --> 00:00:35.266
Then you are lurking near Gao Xiaoyun

18
00:00:35.533 --> 00:00:36.800
Are you going to kill him?

19
00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.166
You can nod or shake your head in response.

20
00:00:39.166 --> 00:00:41.533
If the information you provide satisfies me

21
00:00:41.533 --> 00:00:42.800
I will not only not kill you

22
00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.900
It will also help you remove the cold poison from your body

23
00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:47.033
You building people are so kind

24
00:00:47.133 --> 00:00:49.766
Could it be that he killed me after the trial?

25
00:00:49.866 --> 00:00:50.700
no choice

26
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:51.666
Just trust me.

27
00:00:51.666 --> 00:00:53.666
Otherwise I will kill you now

28
00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:54.966
Not to kill him

29
00:00:54.966 --> 00:00:56.500
natucai

30
00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.833
By kidnapping

31
00:00:59.666 --> 00:01:01.166
Seems to have touched on key information

32
00:01:01.166 --> 00:01:02.300
He couldn't answer.

33
00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.566
What are you doing?

34
00:01:05.966 --> 00:01:07.666
I have explained everything that should be explained

35
00:01:07.666 --> 00:01:08.666
Don't go back on your word

36
00:01:08.666 --> 00:01:09.800
What are you doing

37
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.100
The old lady is still here, don't you say

38
00:01:12.133 --> 00:01:13.466
But this thing

39
00:01:13.766 --> 00:01:15.033
You know everything.
