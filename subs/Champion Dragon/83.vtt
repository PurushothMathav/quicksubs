00:00:00.066 --> 00:00:02.133
It's very simple, you can experience it yourself

2
00:00:02.133 --> 00:00:03.466
Give me your hand

3
00:00:12.466 --> 00:00:14.666
You and Long Shuai actually have the same origin true qi

4
00:00:14.666 --> 00:00:15.866
So did I say

5
00:00:15.866 --> 00:00:18.200
You were fooled into being a gunman by Ouyang Tomb

6
00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:19.866
Then why did you hide your identity?

7
00:00:20.133 --> 00:00:22.166
Because Ouyang Tomb wants to rebel

8
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.400
I had to pretend to be a criminal to sabotage his plans

9
00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.566
But this already involves the matter of the hero's internal affairs

10
00:00:26.566 --> 00:00:27.133
You know it

11
00:00:27.133 --> 00:00:27.966
No need to get involved

12
00:00:27.966 --> 00:00:30.933
You mean I have been deceived by Ouyang Tomb

13
00:00:30.933 --> 00:00:32.966
Even unwittingly participate

14
00:00:32.966 --> 00:00:34.166
See your inner movement of Daxia

15
00:00:34.166 --> 00:00:35.400
I turned out to be his pawn

16
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.400
It's not too much to say you're an abandoned child

17
00:00:37.566 --> 00:00:39.566
After all, he crossed Cao Lin in the first place

18
00:00:39.566 --> 00:00:40.533
Before the rebellion

19
00:00:40.533 --> 00:00:42.766
I've already thought about how to kill him

20
00:00:42.766 --> 00:00:43.500
Poison swallowed to bone

21
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.066
So you Dongying ninjas

22
00:00:45.066 --> 00:00:47.600
Don't think that he will treat you as his own

23
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.400
Okay, you Ouyang Tomb dare to fool me

24
00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:52.833
Miss Guaizi

25
00:00:53.133 --> 00:00:55.666
Your father's death was indeed by my hands

26
00:00:55.866 --> 00:00:57.200
Whether you want revenge

27
00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.300
You can continue the battle if you want.

28
00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:00.400
But I hope not now.

29
00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:01.800
Wait until I finish dealing with Ouyang Tomb

30
00:01:02.366 --> 00:01:03.100
Anytime

31
00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:04.666
I'm not a killer

32
00:01:04.933 --> 00:01:06.366
Now that the matter has been found out

33
00:01:06.366 --> 00:01:08.700
Then I don't need to entangle with you.

34
00:01:09.566 --> 00:01:11.400
Miss Nanako, you abide by morality

35
00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.900
Compared to your father

36
00:01:14.733 --> 00:01:15.933
Sly big dragon shabu

37
00:01:15.933 --> 00:01:18.266
Don't be so glib with me

38
00:01:18.266 --> 00:01:19.700
I'll take someone away

39
00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.166
Stop pestering you

40
00:01:23.066 --> 00:01:24.266
win his favor
