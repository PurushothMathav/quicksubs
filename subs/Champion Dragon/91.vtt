00:00:01.066 --> 00:00:04.566
Hmph, don't kill me, but arrest me, simply say

2
00:00:04.566 --> 00:00:07.033
Although Long Shuai does not have the ability to flop

3
00:00:07.066 --> 00:00:10.666
But there is still the ability to turn the table and perish together

4
00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:12.400
Take you hostage

5
00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.866
Just to let him relax his hands and feet

6
00:00:14.866 --> 00:00:17.866
Don't act outside the rules of the game

7
00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:21.366
So I'm not worthy to be your prey

8
00:00:21.366 --> 00:00:23.266
Only with knives, bait for your fishing

9
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:25.200
Lift the knife and stop here

10
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.633
Zhanwang Chen's knife

11
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.100
I will break your hand

12
00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:31.233
Hang up

13
00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:33.666
Dead Password 3 lost this game

14
00:00:33.666 --> 00:00:35.833
I am also a participant in the game

15
00:00:35.966 --> 00:00:38.433
Guess what? You're not dead.

16
00:00:38.866 --> 00:00:41.500
Nanako, you are from Dongying

17
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.633
Burying people in heaven

18
00:00:43.666 --> 00:00:44.966
Daughter of the ninja god

19
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.600
Owen, you and Ouyang Bathing deceived me with lies

20
00:00:49.666 --> 00:00:51.666
You want me to be your horse?

21
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.366
This time I'm here to kill you

22
00:00:55.666 --> 00:00:58.000
The fruit actually ignored your anti-water step

23
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.300
I can't believe your evil master

24
00:01:00.533 --> 00:01:02.066
You will also lose yourself

25
00:01:02.066 --> 00:01:03.900
Let's kill and bully people and redistribute me

26
00:01:04.566 --> 00:01:06.000
Shura kill me

27
00:01:11.666 --> 00:01:13.166
Hahahaha

28
00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:15.766
Although I have a lot of time today

29
00:01:16.466 --> 00:01:19.233
But my patience is limited

30
00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:20.200
Liu Fan

31
00:01:21.066 --> 00:01:23.000
Give me an accurate answer.

32
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.033
Poplar stop dreaming

33
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.966
Lord Dongshuai did his best

34
00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.233
Absolutely not when you rebel Ma Qianzu

35
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.900
Don't insert into my conversation with Long Shuai for a hundred years

36
00:01:33.566 --> 00:01:35.500
If you dare to argue again

37
00:01:36.066 --> 00:01:38.400
I'll let you go first

38
00:01:40.466 --> 00:01:43.466
Even if boxwood is in a bloodbath today

39
00:01:43.666 --> 00:01:46.400
I won't let you go back to the dungeon to report your order

40
00:01:46.866 --> 00:01:48.366
Stubborn

41
00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.966
Since you don't know the stairs

42
00:01:51.333 --> 00:01:52.733
Then go to hell I want to be angry

43
00:01:52.733 --> 00:01:54.800
Don't forget Lord Long Shuai

44
00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:57.300
Risking the willpower of death

45
00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.000
You will die without a burial place

46
00:01:59.000 --> 00:01:59.833
Ha ha.

47
00:02:00.133 --> 00:02:03.266
Do you think I don't have a defensive chassis?

48
00:02:03.366 --> 00:02:04.066
I'll tell you what.

49
00:02:04.066 --> 00:02:05.733
I've already prepared the ice

50
00:02:05.733 --> 00:02:07.700
Life-saving Soul Recovery Pill

51
00:02:07.866 --> 00:02:09.833
Turns out I didn't want him to

52
00:02:10.133 --> 00:02:11.133
So far

53
00:02:11.133 --> 00:02:12.466
I had no choice but to make trouble

54
00:02:12.533 --> 00:02:12.900
Hu Xiaomu

55
00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.166
I didn't expect you to have a plan ready

56
00:02:16.166 --> 00:02:19.766
Yeah, I'm never unprepared.

57
00:02:19.766 --> 00:02:22.266
Zhang Xiaofan, it's your stupid loyalty that hurt you

58
00:02:22.266 --> 00:02:25.400
Remember how many hearts you have in the next life

59
00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.700
Ah!

60
00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:26.300
Hahahahahahahahahahaha

61
00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.600
Hahahahahaha

62
00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:27.700
Hahahahaha

63
00:02:29.333 --> 00:02:30.133
Ah!

64
00:02:33.766 --> 00:02:34.366
Ah!

65
00:02:34.366 --> 00:02:36.100
Hahahahahahahahahahaha

66
00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:37.000
Ha ha.

67
00:02:37.466 --> 00:02:38.266
Ah!

68
00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:40.166
How is that possible?

69
00:02:40.166 --> 00:02:41.366
Why are you here?

70
00:02:41.366 --> 00:02:43.200
Did Owen miss?
