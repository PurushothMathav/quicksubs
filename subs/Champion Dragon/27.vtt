00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:01.600
What just happened?

2
00:00:02.133 --> 00:00:04.100
Mr. Sun just showed his might

3
00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:06.266
Killed all the robbing ninjas

4
00:00:06.266 --> 00:00:08.600
I'm just here to help

5
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:11.133
My blood belongs to those Dongying ninjas

6
00:00:11.133 --> 00:00:12.200
Yes, yes, yes.

7
00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.333
I just killed those guys

8
00:00:14.333 --> 00:00:16.766
I'll send someone to clean up in a while

9
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.066
Thank you Mr. Sun

10
00:00:18.866 --> 00:00:20.566
Why don't you thank your sister?

11
00:00:20.566 --> 00:00:22.900
Thank you Mr. Sun for your help

12
00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:23.800
trivial matter

13
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:25.200
Never mind.

14
00:00:25.466 --> 00:00:28.200
In this way, Mr. Gao, you can take the contract and go first

15
00:00:28.666 --> 00:00:31.300
I have something else to tell Mr. Liao

16
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:32.300
OK

17
00:00:37.366 --> 00:00:40.433
Long Shuai just offended more

18
00:00:40.566 --> 00:00:42.466
It was you just now

19
00:00:42.866 --> 00:00:43.800
Nice silhouette

20
00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.733
I'll help you too

21
00:00:45.733 --> 00:00:48.400
Oh yes, I found something about

22
00:00:48.933 --> 00:00:50.866
Some information on Cao Lin's remnant party

23
00:00:51.266 --> 00:00:54.266
Get ready, I'll give it to you after the signing meeting.

24
00:00:58.666 --> 00:00:59.600
This is the ciphertext.

25
00:00:59.866 --> 00:01:01.366
And it's Cao Ling's notes

26
00:01:01.366 --> 00:01:02.800
I found it when I copied everyone

27
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.700
It will take a while to decipher it all

28
00:01:04.733 --> 00:01:05.766
But for now

29
00:01:05.766 --> 00:01:07.566
Part of it has been deciphered

30
00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.233
They seem to want

31
00:01:09.733 --> 00:01:11.466
Gao Xiaoyun confessed

32
00:01:11.533 --> 00:01:13.066
Cao Lin before she died

33
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.966
Ready to make a fuss about Gao Xiaoyun

34
00:01:14.966 --> 00:01:17.500
The details of the operation are still not very clear

35
00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.800
But from the current perspective

36
00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.366
Still no execution conditions were triggered?

37
00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.366
I guess there are only two conditions that trigger execution

38
00:01:27.366 --> 00:01:29.700
The first point is to kill me and fail.

39
00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.000
Second, his zombie was exposed

40
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.300
But he never imagined that he would die

41
00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:37.500
We Qinggao clan also guessed the same

42
00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.233
Their real purpose is to cause trouble

43
00:01:40.666 --> 00:01:43.900
Return all their zombies to Takahashi Yun

44
00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:45.266
Then a golden cicada shels its shell

45
00:01:45.566 --> 00:01:47.133
Although Cao Lin is dead

46
00:01:47.133 --> 00:01:49.733
But I think their remnants

47
00:01:49.733 --> 00:01:51.566
Will still do this

48
00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:52.733
Proceed with the plan

49
00:01:52.733 --> 00:01:53.966
This hidden danger is not eliminated

50
00:01:53.966 --> 00:01:56.866
I can't keep Gao Yunqing's promise

51
00:01:57.133 --> 00:01:59.400
The remnants of Cao Ling must be eradicated as soon as possible

52
00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.766
When I immediately asked the buyer to check it out.

53
00:02:01.866 --> 00:02:02.933
You tread carefully

54
00:02:02.933 --> 00:02:05.133
I'll have someone issue a strategy later

55
00:02:05.133 --> 00:02:06.400
Let's hit the mountain to shake the tiger first

56
00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.166
React to this big fish

57
00:02:08.166 --> 00:02:11.966
We must attack the emperor
