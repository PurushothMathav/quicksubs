00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:03.066
Miss Jin fell flat and thanked Her Majesty

2
00:00:04.266 --> 00:00:06.366
I already know

3
00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:10.100
I have also contacted the minister closest to Jinhai

4
00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:12.200
Rush to the main hall of the Mausoleum

5
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.933
Stop this from getting worse

6
00:00:14.933 --> 00:00:17.433
The governor of Kyushu will settle the matter

7
00:00:17.533 --> 00:00:18.966
Please rest assured.

8
00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:23.000
It is impossible for the imperial teacher to be arrogant enough to play first and then

9
00:00:23.266 --> 00:00:25.500
You'll be fine

10
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.766
You bring a token back. What token?

11
00:00:29.133 --> 00:00:30.200
token of proof

12
00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.833
Just bring a token and deliver it.

13
00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:33.900
OK

14
00:00:34.533 --> 00:00:35.833
Keep someone in the palm

15
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.500
The imperial master has sent a sign

16
00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.100
I want you to stop the torture and release people

17
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.533
You can't kill people.

18
00:00:51.533 --> 00:00:55.066
These three people are the core of Cao Ling's remnant party

19
00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.666
How could the Ruling Hall let them go?

20
00:00:57.666 --> 00:01:00.366
Are you going to rebel and become a rebel lord today?

21
00:01:01.333 --> 00:01:04.900
I dare not poplar wood as a Great Xia national teacher

22
00:01:05.266 --> 00:01:06.900
Never act without authorization

23
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.500
Then let him go

24
00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:10.433
Here we are.

25
00:01:11.166 --> 00:01:13.166
Governor Wu of Kyushu

26
00:01:13.166 --> 00:01:14.666
How did he come to the rescue?

27
00:01:14.866 --> 00:01:17.566
Your Excellency Pitto, the traitors have to withdraw

28
00:01:17.866 --> 00:01:19.800
Lord Imperial Preceptor is trying to be blind

29
00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.300
I can't kill people

30
00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:22.466
But can't put it

31
00:01:23.766 --> 00:01:26.000
Ouyang Tomb you and I official correspondence

32
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.533
Today, I, Dai Yuzhao, were ordered to release him

33
00:01:28.533 --> 00:01:29.733
You not only do not

34
00:01:29.733 --> 00:01:31.133
Dare to make conditions with me

35
00:01:31.133 --> 00:01:32.600
Are you going to rebel?
