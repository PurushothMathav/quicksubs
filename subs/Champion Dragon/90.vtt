1
00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:01.700
As the Great Imperial Preceptor

2
00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:03.466
Under one man above ten thousand

3
00:00:03.466 --> 00:00:06.700
The only person who can execute me is the current king Long Shuai

4
00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:08.933
I can only kill you today.

5
00:00:08.933 --> 00:00:10.933
And you can't kill me

6
00:00:10.933 --> 00:00:13.666
Indeed, as long as I don't have Longquan Sword

7
00:00:13.666 --> 00:00:14.900
No royal decree

8
00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:16.800
The most I can do is to cripple you

9
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.233
Escort you back

10
00:00:18.366 --> 00:00:21.100
It's simply not possible for you right now.

11
00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:23.100
You only have two options.

12
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.866
Die with me

13
00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.500
Carrying the name of a traitor

14
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.433
Share the glory with me

15
00:00:30.666 --> 00:00:32.400
One wrong step

16
00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.833
You lose everything.

17
00:00:36.166 --> 00:00:37.566
To quickly and bound to meet

18
00:00:37.566 --> 00:00:39.000
Otherwise, it will be broken by Zhuge

19
00:00:41.566 --> 00:00:42.400
Black War Net

20
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.500
Are you in such a hurry to go back? Do you want to take the wine soldier?

21
00:00:45.766 --> 00:00:47.966
Owen, you and Ouyang Tomb, these two treasons

22
00:00:48.133 --> 00:00:49.333
I'm going to be crushed to ashes

23
00:00:49.333 --> 00:00:54.566
Sorry, there is an old saying in your building called the winner and the loser

24
00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:57.466
You and Long Shuai are both losers today

25
00:00:57.466 --> 00:01:00.400
Successful people are outdated

26
00:01:01.133 --> 00:01:02.266
I'm curious.

27
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.300
What conditions did Ouyang Mu offer you?

28
00:01:05.466 --> 00:01:07.333
A top player like you

29
00:01:07.333 --> 00:01:09.900
Willing to give him the right to be me willingly

30
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.100
Don't be interested

31
00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:14.633
What I dream of is to have a piece of my own spiritual power

32
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.600
Built a killer capital

33
00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.200
Hmph, it's really only white-skinned people like you

34
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.400
To have such disgusting thoughts

35
00:01:21.866 --> 00:01:23.400
Thank you for your compliment.

36
00:01:23.533 --> 00:01:25.500
If you don't have a crooked question.

37
00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:29.833
Then it should fall into my hands as a hostage
