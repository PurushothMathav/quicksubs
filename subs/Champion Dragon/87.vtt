1
00:00:02.066 --> 00:00:05.100
Coach Chen Zhanwang and Miss Qi went out to spy

2
00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:07.666
Why hasn't there been any news yet?

3
00:00:07.733 --> 00:00:09.266
Could something be wrong?

4
00:00:09.266 --> 00:00:10.266
It's useless to rush

5
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.200
You sit down and wait for them to come back.

6
00:00:13.766 --> 00:00:14.400
But

7
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.300
The opponent has two super-first-class experts fighting

8
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:18.400
Something happens easily.

9
00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:19.500
Die in battle

10
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.833
Sooner or later for soldiers

11
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.600
If something bad happens to the corpse

12
00:00:26.666 --> 00:00:29.633
Oops, your skills have recovered to almost a percent

13
00:00:32.566 --> 00:00:34.366
Only 40% of the total victory period

14
00:00:34.566 --> 00:00:36.566
It will take another week to fully recover

15
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.533
Wouldn't that be a last stand?

16
00:00:38.533 --> 00:00:40.200
As long as it can be delayed for a while

17
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.766
I wouldn't choose to do it right away

18
00:00:41.766 --> 00:00:44.733
Now I can only see a tie with Ouyang Tomb

19
00:00:44.733 --> 00:00:46.800
It takes at least 70% to kill him

20
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.400
If I force my luck

21
00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:51.800
A contradiction that requires a loss of at least 10 years no no no

22
00:00:53.666 --> 00:00:55.400
This is too dangerous

23
00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:56.666
Last Stand

24
00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:58.200
The sword has to be struck on the string

25
00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.300
If Ouyang Mu had a chance to breathe

26
00:01:00.366 --> 00:01:01.400
He will definitely

27
00:01:01.766 --> 00:01:02.800
rebel

28
00:01:04.066 --> 00:01:04.900
Hey

29
00:01:05.533 --> 00:01:08.266
It turns out that you are not without flaws

30
00:01:09.366 --> 00:01:10.166
Liu Fan

31
00:01:10.966 --> 00:01:14.166
Today is my chance to kill you

32
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:20.300
OK

33
00:01:22.166 --> 00:01:24.500
Since Chen Tianjiao is not here

34
00:01:25.333 --> 00:01:27.500
Then I'll kill him

35
00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:29.200
OK

36
00:01:31.066 --> 00:01:31.866
who

37
00:01:32.666 --> 00:01:35.066
Wu Shuai meets again
