00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:00.500
Hey

2
00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.033
Does it depend on what's going on today? It's all here.

3
00:00:05.166 --> 00:00:06.333
I checked the order

4
00:00:06.333 --> 00:00:09.000
There are no suspicious figures in the venue

5
00:00:09.133 --> 00:00:11.266
Then according to the violation of the collective surname

6
00:00:11.533 --> 00:00:13.000
Dry ticket hit you hi

7
00:00:15.866 --> 00:00:18.633
Why did you save me?

8
00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.166
Your leader has appeared

9
00:00:21.166 --> 00:00:23.400
You have no intelligence value now

10
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.600
What do you say, I see.

11
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.533
Do you think I can get a good price for it?

12
00:00:27.533 --> 00:00:29.266
To sell me to a place like 5 days

13
00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.100
You won't even let me be yours

14
00:00:32.366 --> 00:00:34.000
That what what that

15
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.300
Your imagination is too rich

16
00:00:36.366 --> 00:00:39.133
But as a reward for showing me the way

17
00:00:39.133 --> 00:00:41.066
As long as you don't do anything to me today

18
00:00:41.266 --> 00:00:42.766
I will always protect you

19
00:00:42.766 --> 00:00:44.900
How about for the sake of saving me?

20
00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:46.233
Trust you for once

21
00:00:46.766 --> 00:00:49.133
Hey, everyone, be quiet first.

22
00:00:49.133 --> 00:00:52.366
Thank you to everyone from Jinghai for visiting Aolong Group

23
00:00:52.366 --> 00:00:54.500
Signing ceremony with Baihao Group

24
00:00:54.766 --> 00:00:57.766
I, Sun Baitian, represent Baihao Group

25
00:00:57.766 --> 00:01:01.000
Here's to Miss Gao and everyone

26
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.566
Let's raise a glass together

27
00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:06.966
Cheers. Let's make some money

28
00:01:12.133 --> 00:01:13.566
Ok everyone please take a seat

29
00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.933
So I'll just give you a moment.

30
00:01:17.933 --> 00:01:19.933
After our bilateral contract is completed

31
00:01:19.933 --> 00:01:21.566
Our prom can start

32
00:01:21.566 --> 00:01:23.166
What is Nada Jiro waiting for?

33
00:01:23.166 --> 00:01:24.366
He's here for maps

34
00:01:24.366 --> 00:01:26.700
This contract is almost over, but he still doesn't do it

35
00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.100
I didn't get the order.

36
00:01:28.333 --> 00:01:30.766
But Jiro Ueda is good at using poison

37
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.300
As expected of poison

38
00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:34.800
You are poisonous

39
00:01:35.066 --> 00:01:37.966
This guy is waiting for everyone to drink the celebration wine

40
00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.400
Please fucking two ghosts represent today's cooperation

41
00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.100
Hey Mr. Cai Tian

42
00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.866
Today is the cooperation between Aolong and Baihao Group

43
00:01:46.866 --> 00:01:47.400
Like with you

44
00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.266
Dongren Group has no business relationship, right?

45
00:01:49.266 --> 00:01:50.133
Cai Tianci Lang

46
00:01:50.133 --> 00:01:51.900
If you interfere with the invasion ritual again

47
00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:53.500
I'm going to ask you out.

48
00:01:54.533 --> 00:01:55.666
Just this

49
00:01:55.666 --> 00:01:58.266
I want the cars from your two companies

50
00:01:58.266 --> 00:02:00.566
Because all the guests present

51
00:02:00.566 --> 00:02:02.766
You have to pay a hundred million protection fee

52
00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:04.266
What right do you have?
