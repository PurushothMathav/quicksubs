00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.700
I can't believe he would rather commit suicide

2
00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:04.033
He refused to beg for mercy.

3
00:00:04.733 --> 00:00:06.600
I wanted to torture him

4
00:00:06.733 --> 00:00:08.266
Escaped by this old thing

5
00:00:08.266 --> 00:00:09.233
Anyway.

6
00:00:09.566 --> 00:00:11.166
The dust has settled

7
00:00:11.166 --> 00:00:13.100
Sister, we can now

8
00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:14.666
Go back to the city openly

9
00:00:14.666 --> 00:00:17.633
Yeah, you don't have to hide your identity anymore

10
00:00:17.733 --> 00:00:18.866
and

11
00:00:19.933 --> 00:00:20.200
and

12
00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:23.466
Stay away from women who shouldn't be too close

13
00:00:23.466 --> 00:00:24.633
leave

14
00:00:24.766 --> 00:00:25.933
Senior sister senior sister

15
00:00:25.933 --> 00:00:27.566
When can you be gentle?

16
00:00:27.566 --> 00:00:28.700
When did you become honest?

17
00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:30.133
When did I become gentle?

18
00:00:30.133 --> 00:00:32.300
Long Shun, since the matter has been resolved

19
00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:34.666
I brought people back to Dongying, this golden pill

20
00:00:34.966 --> 00:00:37.500
As your reward for hiring me to kill Ouyang's tomb

21
00:00:37.766 --> 00:00:38.900
Hey, Nanako

22
00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:41.166
Your asking price is too high, let's talk about it

23
00:00:41.166 --> 00:00:42.800
You willingly killed Ouyang Tomb

24
00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.000
I didn't force you.

25
00:00:45.266 --> 00:00:47.800
Take it as your reward

26
00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:50.800
Hey you

27
00:00:53.066 --> 00:00:55.366
You don't have a long memory after saying that, do you?

28
00:00:55.366 --> 00:00:57.200
When will I stop having a long memory?

29
00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.133
Is this what people deserve?

30
00:00:59.133 --> 00:01:01.000
Sister, be generous

31
00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.600
I'll take Ouyang Mu's body back to the ground first

32
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.266
I'll give you three days.

33
00:01:05.333 --> 00:01:07.233
Farewell to Gao Xiaoyun

34
00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.066
Then come back and meet me

35
00:01:09.066 --> 00:01:11.400
Wait a minute, I'll go see Miss Qin too

36
00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.400
Then contact Lord Wu

37
00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:14.566
Tell him something

38
00:01:14.566 --> 00:01:16.566
It's over, it's time to wrap up
