00:00:00.466 --> 00:00:01.366
Have you thought about it?

2
00:00:01.366 --> 00:00:02.866
I'm not afraid of you

3
00:00:02.866 --> 00:00:05.333
But who treats you well and who treats you badly?

4
00:00:05.333 --> 00:00:06.666
Do you have a good idea?

5
00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:09.700
Oh, dear.

6
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.600
Don't forget these shoes.

7
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:13.666
Bitter Winter Buddha

8
00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:15.466
Your name is in my hands

9
00:00:15.466 --> 00:00:18.133
Everything you have is given to you by bamboo

10
00:00:18.133 --> 00:00:18.966
So to speak

11
00:00:18.966 --> 00:00:21.166
You have absolute control over your subordinates

12
00:00:21.166 --> 00:00:22.400
Of course!

13
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.066
I could use that word for a freak dance.

14
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:26.566
I don't raise money.

15
00:00:26.566 --> 00:00:28.700
He has no complaints, so you hurry up and change careers

16
00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:30.266
Real meat business

17
00:00:30.266 --> 00:00:32.800
It's more money than you make by killing and setting fires

18
00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.833
What are you sending to kill?

19
00:00:37.533 --> 00:00:38.500
What should I do?

20
00:00:38.666 --> 00:00:39.900
Disobedience is death

21
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.466
But this bodyguard can easily kill me

22
00:00:42.566 --> 00:00:45.000
See if you dare to disobey

23
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.033
Then you die first.

24
00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:51.333
In that case

25
00:00:51.333 --> 00:00:55.000
I'll let you taste my secretary cheetah flight

26
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.633
Let you go together

27
00:00:58.266 --> 00:00:59.100
Stop

28
00:01:01.133 --> 00:01:01.933
Vegetable field zilan

29
00:01:02.466 --> 00:01:03.800
This is my turf

30
00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.466
How dare you be rude to my guests

31
00:01:05.466 --> 00:01:07.066
Yes, this will provoke me first

32
00:01:07.066 --> 00:01:08.600
You provoked Miss Qin first

33
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.133
I like to lecture you the most

34
00:01:10.133 --> 00:01:11.666
People who use women as tools

35
00:01:11.666 --> 00:01:13.433
Mr. Danada

36
00:01:13.466 --> 00:01:14.833
Liao Fan is my bodyguard

37
00:01:15.133 --> 00:01:16.766
If he did something wrong

38
00:01:16.766 --> 00:01:17.900
You can tell me.

39
00:01:18.166 --> 00:01:21.000
But there's no need to jump to him

40
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.700
Okay, little bodyguard

41
00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.300
So many people are supporting you today

42
00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.533
It seems that there will be other leaders in a while.

43
00:01:27.533 --> 00:01:29.133
Come here too, you guessed it

44
00:01:29.133 --> 00:01:30.600
Or maybe he won't come.

45
00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.466
Maybe he arrived long ago.
