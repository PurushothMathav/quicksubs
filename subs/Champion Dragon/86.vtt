00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:05.300
One night passed

2
00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:07.500
Nanako still didn't reply to the message.

3
00:00:08.366 --> 00:00:09.233
estimate

4
00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.800
Killed Nanako

5
00:00:13.133 --> 00:00:15.233
I, Mr. Yang, go out on the street

6
00:00:15.533 --> 00:00:17.700
Solve the smoke insurance at the door

7
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:19.166
I go out the back door

8
00:00:19.166 --> 00:00:21.433
Go and confirm the condition of the measuring sail in person.

9
00:00:21.666 --> 00:00:22.866
Operation Grave

10
00:00:32.333 --> 00:00:34.400
What to do? It looks like Owen is leaving.

11
00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:35.366
Before they leave

12
00:00:35.366 --> 00:00:36.733
All the plans are discussed

13
00:00:36.733 --> 00:00:37.966
Go back and meet up with your junior brother first

14
00:00:37.966 --> 00:00:40.033
Don't act rashly

15
00:00:47.133 --> 00:00:50.466
Frost Snow didn't expect the two of you to end up in person

16
00:00:50.466 --> 00:00:51.166
How is that possible?

17
00:00:51.166 --> 00:00:52.333
Didn't you just leave?

18
00:00:52.333 --> 00:00:55.133
I forgot to take the key and come back to have a look, okay?

19
00:00:55.133 --> 00:00:57.166
Just keep your hands closed and kiss

20
00:00:57.166 --> 00:01:00.466
Loser

21
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.366
There is no way to take Miss Qin away

22
00:01:05.966 --> 00:01:06.900
Sorry, both.

23
00:01:07.366 --> 00:01:08.900
I will definitely come back to save you.

24
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.166
Lord He has caught one of Liao Fan's subordinates

25
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.800
He's running away all day

26
00:01:23.966 --> 00:01:26.066
It will take a while recently.

27
00:01:26.066 --> 00:01:27.833
Okay, got it.
