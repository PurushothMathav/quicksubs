00:00:00.533 --> 00:00:03.266
Doesn't sound like a roll call

2
00:00:03.533 --> 00:00:06.700
Why do you feel like you are escorting half and half of the prisoners?

3
00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:09.833
I have a very strong feeling of foreboding

4
00:00:10.933 --> 00:00:13.433
Mr. Gao, I think something is wrong

5
00:00:13.566 --> 00:00:15.933
Why don't we use the name of a business trip?

6
00:00:15.933 --> 00:00:17.066
Leave Jin and hide

7
00:00:17.766 --> 00:00:19.500
Mr. Sun has already said it just now

8
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:20.700
If you don't go

9
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:22.200
The National Teacher Association will personally help

10
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:23.300
Fa-rectification on the spot

11
00:00:24.133 --> 00:00:24.966
currently

12
00:00:25.666 --> 00:00:28.200
Only the road to the banquet can be hung

13
00:00:28.533 --> 00:00:29.700
But don't worry.

14
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:31.933
Mr. Liao and I will take care of you

15
00:00:31.933 --> 00:00:33.666
You don't have to worry. Yes.

16
00:00:35.966 --> 00:00:37.833
That's the only way for now

17
00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.066
Can't escape fire

18
00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.266
Then I'll go back and prepare.

19
00:00:42.366 --> 00:00:43.666
Come back tomorrow

20
00:00:43.766 --> 00:00:46.033
Take you to Linda Hall

21
00:00:53.066 --> 00:00:54.166
Act like it

22
00:00:54.166 --> 00:00:56.966
Make people think you're here to stop me

23
00:00:59.566 --> 00:01:01.566
Say who sent you

24
00:01:01.666 --> 00:01:03.000
What do you aim at?

25
00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:06.066
Purpose Killing you is my purpose

26
00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:09.400
It seems that I will not kill you.

27
00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.200
It can't be like the imperial city

28
00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:16.466
Owen

29
00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.766
Chen Zhaiwa, what are you going to do back in the city?

30
00:01:20.766 --> 00:01:22.600
The world's number one master Owen

31
00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:24.866
Lord Owen

32
00:01:25.066 --> 00:01:27.300
I knew I was defeated, so I quit first

33
00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:30.600
Chen Tianjia

34
00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.633
I'm here for your country head and secret letter from the state guard

35
00:01:33.766 --> 00:01:34.833
Forget it.

36
00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:37.666
Wait until the old lady tells the king your secret

37
00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.400
Your days are numbered

38
00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:40.866
overreach

39
00:01:40.966 --> 00:01:45.366
Taking the king is not my opponent at all
