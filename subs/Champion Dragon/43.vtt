1
00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:04.200
For the sake of your sincere repentance

2
00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:05.533
I'll give you one more chance.

3
00:00:05.533 --> 00:00:07.766
As long as you pay for your own martial arts and cut off your hands and feet

4
00:00:07.766 --> 00:00:09.566
I will no longer hold you accountable

5
00:00:09.666 --> 00:00:12.133
If I say just kill them

6
00:00:12.133 --> 00:00:14.100
That won't work once they're dead

7
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:15.733
The remnants who besieged Gao Xiaoyun

8
00:00:15.733 --> 00:00:17.000
Just choose to run away

9
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.733
Hitting mountains and shaking tigers is a big discount

10
00:00:18.733 --> 00:00:19.566
Not cost-effective

11
00:00:20.133 --> 00:00:21.400
Just control it

12
00:00:21.766 --> 00:00:24.166
Yes, yes, no cost-effective, no cost-effective.

13
00:00:24.166 --> 00:00:27.133
Wouldn't it be better to keep us both alive

14
00:00:27.133 --> 00:00:30.033
After all, he can't say this Ouyang

15
00:00:30.166 --> 00:00:32.200
If we say it, we will die

16
00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:33.466
We don't know anything.

17
00:00:33.466 --> 00:00:36.300
We are willing to give up our martial arts and cut off our limbs to atone for our sins

18
00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.566
Say what Ouyang doesn't say

19
00:00:39.566 --> 00:00:40.866
I'm going to use Soul Searcher!

20
00:00:40.866 --> 00:00:42.333
I urge you to cooperate honestly

21
00:00:42.333 --> 00:00:44.000
Otherwise it's a dead end

22
00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:46.900
Ok then I say

23
00:00:47.266 --> 00:00:48.866
Anyway, it's all running script

24
00:00:48.933 --> 00:00:49.866
That Cao Ling?

25
00:00:49.866 --> 00:00:51.733
The conspiracy and conspiracy are all led by the European balcony

26
00:00:51.733 --> 00:00:52.533
i

27
00:00:52.966 --> 00:00:53.766
Ah!

28
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:55.700
Ah!

29
00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:57.866
Ahhhh!

30
00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:02.233
Ahhhh!

31
00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.400
Qinghai has a day and night attack again

32
00:01:14.666 --> 00:01:17.800
I need to confirm it myself

33
00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.466
Long Shuai's corpse

34
00:01:19.466 --> 00:01:21.000
Not found

35
00:01:21.466 --> 00:01:25.866
It is very likely that he was blown up and sneaked into the Gimhaigan

36
00:01:26.133 --> 00:01:27.166
Lord Guo

37
00:01:27.166 --> 00:01:28.266
I'll do it!

38
00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.133
Even if Aunt Dragon kills me

39
00:01:30.133 --> 00:01:31.800
As the world's number one assassin

40
00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.733
I want him to die again

41
00:01:33.733 --> 00:01:36.966
Anyway, I want to preside over the spiritual ceremony myself

42
00:01:36.966 --> 00:01:38.266
Then take a run

43
00:01:38.266 --> 00:01:39.766
You and I can accompany you

44
00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:44.666
Personally let Long Shuai's death completely change the official appointment

45
00:01:44.933 --> 00:01:45.733
Yes!

46
00:01:47.066 --> 00:01:48.233
It's a mysterious spell

47
00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.633
It seems that the mastermind behind the scenes planned it perfectly

48
00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.400
To plant a spell without their knowledge

49
00:01:57.566 --> 00:01:59.300
Dead can't be saved

50
00:02:01.966 --> 00:02:02.866
Ouyang

51
00:02:03.966 --> 00:02:05.800
Looks like things are getting better

52
00:02:06.333 --> 00:02:08.233
It's Ouyang Mu

53
00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:10.766
Ouyang Mu

54
00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.600
That is Great Xia National Preceptor?

55
00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.966
Yeah, I hope I'm wrong.

56
00:02:16.966 --> 00:02:17.933
Admire Tongdi

57
00:02:17.933 --> 00:02:19.766
That should be the worst outcome

58
00:02:19.766 --> 00:02:22.233
So let's see how mature it is first
