1
00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.866
It's more serious than me

2
00:00:24.366 --> 00:00:26.466
Long Shuai will die in battle from today

3
00:00:26.466 --> 00:00:28.666
The living is an ordinary person Liao Fan

4
00:00:28.666 --> 00:00:30.000
Do you understand?

5
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.800
Su Qing, a traitorous remnant, never leaked secrets before

6
00:00:34.366 --> 00:00:35.166
dragon

7
00:00:36.366 --> 00:00:37.866
Mr. Bah Liao

8
00:00:37.933 --> 00:00:40.500
This is all the information about Gao Xiaoyun.

9
00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:42.066
Please take a look

10
00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:45.900
Gao Xiaoyun, President of Aolong Group

11
00:00:46.166 --> 00:00:47.300
I see.

12
00:00:52.166 --> 00:00:54.466
Mr. Gao, it's time to interview the bodyguard

13
00:00:54.466 --> 00:00:56.166
Then let all the interviewers in.

14
00:00:56.166 --> 00:00:57.566
I'm going to pick the best one

15
00:00:57.566 --> 00:00:58.700
Come on in.

16
00:01:01.266 --> 00:01:02.200
Why are you alone?

17
00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.900
Anybody else?

18
00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.566
Ah, everyone else was taken to the hospital

19
00:01:05.566 --> 00:01:08.000
I'm the only one here for the interview.

20
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.933
You actually got into a fight at the Australian Dragon Group, no

21
00:01:10.933 --> 00:01:11.533
Not really.

22
00:01:11.533 --> 00:01:13.700
I knocked them all out in one move

23
00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.000
So don't worry about riots at all

24
00:01:16.133 --> 00:01:16.933
Blow you

25
00:01:16.933 --> 00:01:19.166
You were the only one who knocked down 40 test takers

26
00:01:19.166 --> 00:01:20.800
Do you think you are Huaxia Long Shuai?

27
00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:21.933
This interviewer

28
00:01:21.933 --> 00:01:23.966
Your cow is blowing too big

29
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.500
There is simply no one in this world

30
00:01:26.533 --> 00:01:28.300
Can take down 40 people in one move

31
00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:31.033
Even Long Shuai can't do it

32
00:01:31.066 --> 00:01:33.633
You lost the election, get out and tell me

33
00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:36.400
The hospital suddenly sent 40 medical compensation

34
00:01:36.533 --> 00:01:37.566
Although the number is not large

35
00:01:37.566 --> 00:01:39.066
But this is weird.

36
00:01:39.466 --> 00:01:41.466
Can you prove it now?

37
00:01:43.966 --> 00:01:45.033
What do you want?

38
00:01:47.533 --> 00:01:49.100
Wrangler program?

39
00:01:49.366 --> 00:01:51.066
You're being watched.

40
00:01:51.066 --> 00:01:51.900
Really

41
00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:53.966
I have never seen such a program before

42
00:01:55.933 --> 00:01:58.033
Tell me, how much monthly salary do you want?

43
00:01:58.066 --> 00:01:59.000
Uh whatever

44
00:01:59.133 --> 00:02:01.766
Just give me some. I don't care about the money.

45
00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.233
Are you kidding me?

46
00:02:06.533 --> 00:02:08.500
Don't move! What are you doing?
