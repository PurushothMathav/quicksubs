00:00:01.533 --> 00:00:04.500
Zhanwang Chen, it's you who saved me

2
00:00:04.766 --> 00:00:05.533
Zhang Yuntao

3
00:00:05.533 --> 00:00:08.433
Liu Xishan and the other two are Cao Lin's rebels

4
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.266
I have killed

5
00:00:10.866 --> 00:00:12.400
City Lord, you are saved

6
00:00:13.733 --> 00:00:15.866
Thank you, Warlord, for helping me eradicate Xianning

7
00:00:16.133 --> 00:00:17.700
Song did not forget his kindness

8
00:00:18.166 --> 00:00:21.400
Zhanwang Chen, then I will take Mr. Gao back first

9
00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.466
Please handle the rest.

10
00:00:24.566 --> 00:00:25.833
Just leave it to me.

11
00:00:26.666 --> 00:00:28.300
Let's go

12
00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.366
What's wrong? What's wrong?

13
00:00:32.166 --> 00:00:33.533
Hey, it's alright.

14
00:00:33.533 --> 00:00:36.800
I can do it. Don't move.

15
00:00:41.333 --> 00:00:43.800
City Lord Song also invites you

16
00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:45.866
Take me to their place

17
00:00:45.866 --> 00:00:48.166
I'm going to search

18
00:00:48.966 --> 00:00:49.833
this way

19
00:00:56.533 --> 00:00:57.333
Ah!

20
00:00:57.966 --> 00:00:59.100
What's going on here?

21
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.800
What happened to Mr. Gao?

22
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.700
Cao Lin sent someone to kill me

23
00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:04.400
There's a lot going on.

24
00:01:04.933 --> 00:01:07.533
Thanks to Liao, he managed to rush under the Wang Pavilion

25
00:01:07.533 --> 00:01:09.033
To settle the matter

26
00:01:09.333 --> 00:01:11.266
Liao Fan, you can really hide

27
00:01:11.266 --> 00:01:12.866
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

28
00:01:12.866 --> 00:01:15.066
Your Highness sent you to protect me

29
00:01:15.133 --> 00:01:17.200
I just think the endgame of this play

30
00:01:17.333 --> 00:01:19.166
I don't need to tell you.

31
00:01:19.266 --> 00:01:21.600
Gao Zong, you have a bodyguard like Liao Fan

32
00:01:21.666 --> 00:01:23.100
It's your blessing.

33
00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.466
Hey, I went to the hospital if there was nothing wrong.

34
00:01:27.466 --> 00:01:28.466
I lasted so long

35
00:01:28.466 --> 00:01:29.700
I also suffered a lot of injuries

36
00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:31.300
Liao Fan

37
00:01:32.533 --> 00:01:34.266
You have such good skills

38
00:01:34.366 --> 00:01:36.133
Make sure you only want to make a few thousand dollars

39
00:01:36.133 --> 00:01:37.700
Instead of tens of millions?

40
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.533
I don't want to repeat what I said

41
00:01:40.533 --> 00:01:42.433
I'm only responsible for keeping you safe.

42
00:01:45.466 --> 00:01:48.700
Secretary Zhang, help me take Mr. Sun to Office No. 2

43
00:01:48.966 --> 00:01:51.400
I still have something to talk to Liao Fan alone

44
00:01:51.466 --> 00:01:53.433
Okay, this way please.

45
00:01:58.566 --> 00:02:00.200
Mr. Gao, do you have anything else to do?

46
00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.166
Mr. Gao, I'm going to the hospital

47
00:02:02.733 --> 00:02:06.400
If you didn't say it when you first joined

48
00:02:07.766 --> 00:02:09.500
Can I pay the salary?

49
00:02:09.566 --> 00:02:11.700
Since there are no restrictions

50
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.433
Then I'll give you a special one.
