00:00:01.133 --> 00:00:03.600
Brother, is your news accurate?

2
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.800
Didn't you say that Miss Zuo was going to the temple this morning?

3
00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:06.633
Temple?

4
00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:09.500
But it's almost noon, why haven't you come out yet?

5
00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:11.933
Don't worry, since you choose to be a hunter

6
00:00:11.933 --> 00:00:13.566
Have the patience of a hunter

7
00:00:15.533 --> 00:00:16.600
Here it comes.

8
00:00:22.566 --> 00:00:23.366
Miss

9
00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:29.666
Go to the notification office to be safe

10
00:00:29.666 --> 00:00:31.033
Hurry up and act

11
00:00:40.566 --> 00:00:41.633
Here we go. Okay.

12
00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:43.866
out of the way

13
00:00:43.866 --> 00:00:44.900
Get out of the way

14
00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:47.433
Get out of the way, get out of the way

15
00:00:48.866 --> 00:00:51.066
Get out of the way, let it go, let it go, I can't stop

16
00:00:51.066 --> 00:00:52.666
I can't stop, I can't hurt

17
00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:58.300
Ah!

18
00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.900
Ouch, are you alright, brother, are you alright?

19
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:01.833
Where did you hit?

20
00:01:02.066 --> 00:01:03.400
You hit my leg!

21
00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:04.733
You're okay, don't worry, my leg.

22
00:01:04.733 --> 00:01:05.800
I didn't say you left first

23
00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:07.600
My leg, you go first, go first

24
00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.400
Don't go, don't go

25
00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.666
Don't go, oops, oops.

26
00:01:12.733 --> 00:01:13.666
Miss

27
00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.833
Miss Miss

28
00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:17.966
Miss

29
00:01:17.966 --> 00:01:21.066
Miss oh miss
