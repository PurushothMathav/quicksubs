1
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:09.666
Just cross

2
00:00:09.666 --> 00:00:12.066
What's the matter with crossing into a cell?

3
00:00:12.533 --> 00:00:15.800
God, aren't you playing with me?

4
00:00:16.866 --> 00:00:19.300
Poor me, old and young

5
00:00:19.333 --> 00:00:21.033
I'm still a good young man

6
00:00:21.133 --> 00:00:21.933
Hey

7
00:00:22.533 --> 00:00:23.466
No way.

8
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:26.266
I can't sit still

9
00:00:27.133 --> 00:00:30.266
I have to find a way to save myself

10
00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:35.200
Jizhou

11
00:00:35.933 --> 00:00:37.766
Yuan Shen's second uncle is upright

12
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.300
Never arson

13
00:00:41.666 --> 00:00:43.233
As long as the culprit behind the scenes can be found

14
00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:45.466
Solve the case

15
00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:48.400
Everything is solved

16
00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:51.766
But

17
00:00:53.133 --> 00:00:54.566
I am in this place

18
00:00:54.866 --> 00:00:57.266
How can I find the murderer?

19
00:01:00.733 --> 00:01:03.000
By the way, if memory serves

20
00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:04.433
dossier

21
00:01:05.366 --> 00:01:06.566
According to historical records

22
00:01:06.966 --> 00:01:09.766
The file records the whole case solid wood

23
00:01:09.766 --> 00:01:11.066
As long as I can find the dossier

24
00:01:11.533 --> 00:01:14.300
It's all over

25
00:01:15.266 --> 00:01:16.700
Ah, that's right.

26
00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:19.000
big brother

27
00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:23.000
Your Majesty has ordered

28
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.966
Taidao was suspected of arson and murder

29
00:01:24.966 --> 00:01:25.700
Murder official

30
00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.533
Take down all those who are not suitable for love

31
00:01:27.533 --> 00:01:28.966
Put in jail

32
00:01:28.966 --> 00:01:30.266
My Qin family is loyal and good

33
00:01:30.266 --> 00:01:31.366
It must be slander

34
00:01:31.466 --> 00:01:32.266
It's slander.

35
00:01:32.266 --> 00:01:33.333
I have reported that I am the chairperson

36
00:01:33.333 --> 00:01:34.800
Stop talking to me

37
00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.700
Shut up bro

38
00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.800
Take the second brother and go to the army, chase after him

39
00:01:40.133 --> 00:01:41.933
Qin Mo, why are you here?

40
00:01:41.933 --> 00:01:43.033
I was right

41
00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:44.400
Why aren't you locked up?

42
00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:45.666
I am the head of the imperial prison

43
00:01:45.666 --> 00:01:46.900
New house can be exempted

44
00:01:47.166 --> 00:01:48.466
But it was separated from fame

45
00:01:48.466 --> 00:01:49.766
Never be an official

46
00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.266
Why can't readers be exempted from punishment?

47
00:01:53.466 --> 00:01:55.033
Isn't that differential treatment?

48
00:01:55.066 --> 00:01:57.300
What are you talking about?

49
00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.400
No, I mean, oh, right.

50
00:01:59.866 --> 00:02:00.666
Do me a favor

51
00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.033
What are you busy with? I want to see Junzong
