00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:01.500
Brother Qin

2
00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:04.366
Don't be so pessimistic?

3
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.566
You and I are brothers after all

4
00:00:06.566 --> 00:00:07.900
I want to kill you.

5
00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:09.266
You're already dead.

6
00:00:09.266 --> 00:00:10.900
I won't live to be now

7
00:00:11.466 --> 00:00:12.733
Then what are you doing here?

8
00:00:12.733 --> 00:00:15.400
Are you here to see my jokes?

9
00:00:15.733 --> 00:00:17.266
I came here because

10
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.300
I think Brother Qin is a talent

11
00:00:20.333 --> 00:00:23.033
It's a pity to die like this

12
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.233
Why don't you follow me and work under me

13
00:00:26.533 --> 00:00:28.300
I guarantee you a lifetime of glory

14
00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.500
How about he shut up

15
00:00:32.733 --> 00:00:34.666
It's nonsense

16
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.300
You just called me an ant and a citizen

17
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:39.800
I thought you were awesome

18
00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.066
It turns out that you are just another person's dog.

19
00:00:43.166 --> 00:00:44.100
bastard

20
00:00:46.866 --> 00:00:48.100
What's my proposal?

21
00:00:48.966 --> 00:00:50.166
Not much.

22
00:00:50.266 --> 00:00:54.000
It seems that Brother Qin still does not understand the situation

23
00:00:54.333 --> 00:00:57.266
Brother Sun, I am in very good health.

24
00:00:57.266 --> 00:00:58.500
It's just that the waist is not very good

25
00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:59.566
Can't bend

26
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.200
Why don't you come and rub it for me?

27
00:01:01.333 --> 00:01:03.033
You pariah are courting death

28
00:01:03.166 --> 00:01:05.233
Shut up yeah

29
00:01:05.933 --> 00:01:08.800
Well, since you insist on courting death

30
00:01:09.166 --> 00:01:11.500
Lord Wu, take the things

31
00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:14.666
What is this?

32
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.900
Of course it's your murder confession

33
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.266
Brother Sun is trying to force tribute by words and deeds

34
00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.200
I told you so.

35
00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:24.566
You have no choice.

36
00:01:25.166 --> 00:01:26.833
What if I don't sign?
