00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:01.833
For the sake of fairness

2
00:00:01.933 --> 00:00:05.000
How about I do it this time?

3
00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:06.266
Adults please

4
00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:09.800
Since you are all capable people in solving cases

5
00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:13.900
It just so happens that the Criminal Department had a difficult case a few days ago

6
00:00:14.133 --> 00:00:16.466
Let's see which of you can solve it

7
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.000
Sir, you can ask the question.

8
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.500
No matter how difficult the case

9
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.300
Students are confident they can solve it

10
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.300
Xuan Zheng actually did not participate in the whole process

11
00:00:23.533 --> 00:00:25.900
It seems that the identity in front of me is not simple.

12
00:00:26.166 --> 00:00:27.966
Pioneer, how about you?

13
00:00:28.766 --> 00:00:31.366
Hello sir

14
00:00:32.066 --> 00:00:35.100
Go and call someone over

15
00:00:41.733 --> 00:00:43.766
The adults have stayed

16
00:00:46.333 --> 00:00:49.100
These three are the suspects in this case

17
00:00:49.566 --> 00:00:51.466
The older one is Lao Han Li

18
00:00:51.466 --> 00:00:53.133
The young man's name is Liu Neng

19
00:00:53.133 --> 00:00:54.533
The woman is Li Bazu

20
00:00:54.533 --> 00:00:58.000
A few days ago, Liu Neng and Li Dazu went to Jingzhaofu to complain of injustice

21
00:00:58.666 --> 00:01:01.700
Said that Lao Li took 400 taels of silver from them

22
00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:03.633
And Li Lao Han said

23
00:01:03.933 --> 00:01:07.466
It was his daughter and son-in-law who were going to take his property.

24
00:01:07.666 --> 00:01:09.566
Both sides agree

25
00:01:09.566 --> 00:01:11.200
No physical evidence

26
00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.700
So it has been impossible to decide

27
00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.066
This case is really difficult

28
00:01:16.133 --> 00:01:18.933
As the so-called Jin Guan can't break the housework

29
00:01:18.933 --> 00:01:22.366
That's good, which of you two will come first?

30
00:01:22.366 --> 00:01:24.466
Brother, are you sure?

31
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.033
No hurry, let's wait and see.

32
00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.333
It is better for Mr. Li to let the younger generation come first

33
00:01:32.333 --> 00:01:34.700
It just happened to show some people

34
00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.766
What is a real case?

35
00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.000
Ok hahaha

36
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.500
Then it's up to you first
