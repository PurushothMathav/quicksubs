00:00:02.133 --> 00:00:04.166
What's wrong with me?

2
00:00:04.466 --> 00:00:07.166
No, I was kidnapped by an adult

3
00:00:07.566 --> 00:00:09.666
This girl is so pretty

4
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.433
I just said your breasts are big and soft

5
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.666
So comfortable what

6
00:00:16.733 --> 00:00:18.266
You didn't call me together?

7
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:19.766
What are you thinking?

8
00:00:19.766 --> 00:00:20.800
He's also a chef

9
00:00:21.366 --> 00:00:24.800
Nonsense, the daughter after the fifth left is still thorny boudoir

10
00:00:24.866 --> 00:00:26.233
Did I know he was a chef?

11
00:00:26.866 --> 00:00:28.766
They actually know my identity

12
00:00:30.866 --> 00:00:33.966
Hey, what do you think Mr. Sun will do with this woman?

13
00:00:34.166 --> 00:00:36.433
Although it is a collection of outstanding beauties

14
00:00:36.533 --> 00:00:38.633
But it doesn't seem safe to keep it

15
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:40.566
You think too much

16
00:00:40.766 --> 00:00:42.966
At most, Mr. Sun will play for a while

17
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.800
I got tired of it, so I strangled it and buried it in this yard

18
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:47.700
Who knows?

19
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.200
Wait for Mr. Sun to get tired of playing

20
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.700
Let's have a few sips of soup

21
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.066
This bitch has tender skin

22
00:00:52.066 --> 00:00:54.300
Much more watery than the women in Goulan

23
00:00:54.533 --> 00:00:57.766
It's just that if Mr. Sun didn't want to try it

24
00:00:57.766 --> 00:00:59.266
Now let's get rid of him

25
00:00:59.266 --> 00:01:00.566
Who says it's not?

26
00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.333
Who let people be different from each other?

27
00:01:03.333 --> 00:01:04.766
Hey, enough is enough

28
00:01:04.766 --> 00:01:05.766
Go for a drink

29
00:01:05.766 --> 00:01:07.600
Is drinking bad?

30
00:01:08.066 --> 00:01:09.900
Why do you have to wake up?

31
00:01:10.333 --> 00:01:12.966
Don't worry, I didn't find the drug just now.

32
00:01:12.966 --> 00:01:14.900
I'll never wake up until night

33
00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.100
All right, let's go. Let's go.

34
00:01:19.333 --> 00:01:21.166
No, can't sit still

35
00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.466
Watching them go out together

36
00:01:23.466 --> 00:01:24.866
Find a way to escape

37
00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:41.800
You are locked
