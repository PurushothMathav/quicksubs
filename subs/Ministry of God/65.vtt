00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:01.200
Your Majesty

2
00:00:01.766 --> 00:00:03.866
How are you back?

3
00:00:03.933 --> 00:00:06.066
Dr. Qin returned home safe and sound

4
00:00:06.466 --> 00:00:08.700
Hu County Magistrate has been beheaded by the lower official

5
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.566
What about the kid named Sun Qian?

6
00:00:11.966 --> 00:00:14.366
Dr. Qin drove Sun Qian out of the country

7
00:00:14.366 --> 00:00:15.300
Never hire

8
00:00:17.533 --> 00:00:19.766
Hmm, kind of interesting

9
00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:21.966
But Your Majesty

10
00:00:21.966 --> 00:00:24.366
The Qin Sun family has completely turned their faces

11
00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.600
What if the Sun family attacks Dr. Qin?

12
00:00:27.733 --> 00:00:30.066
Do you want to send more people to protect it?

13
00:00:30.066 --> 00:00:30.866
No need.

14
00:00:31.533 --> 00:00:33.500
If he died so easily

15
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:36.300
That just proves he's a piece of crap

16
00:00:36.466 --> 00:00:39.866
I don't need waste around me

17
00:00:39.933 --> 00:00:40.900
But

18
00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.200
What you said makes sense.

19
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.700
Since everyone wants to play

20
00:00:44.866 --> 00:00:47.400
Then it's within the rules, whatever

21
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.233
Anyone who breaks the rules

22
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.900
Don't blame me for being ruthless

23
00:00:52.333 --> 00:00:55.500
Yes, you send a few people to protect it secretly.

24
00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.833
If the Sun family dares to make a move

25
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.100
Then give him a warning

26
00:01:00.133 --> 00:01:02.900
It's Your Majesty's retreat under the tree

27
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:05.400
Forward

28
00:01:05.933 --> 00:01:06.733
Humph

29
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.466
Kind of interesting.
