00:00:04.133 --> 00:00:05.666
Sir, please drink tea

2
00:00:05.666 --> 00:00:06.766
Thank you girl

3
00:00:10.466 --> 00:00:12.600
The little girl got to know the young master for a while

4
00:00:12.766 --> 00:00:14.800
I don't know the full name of the son either.

5
00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:16.900
Qin Feng Qin Feng

6
00:00:18.266 --> 00:00:20.300
Could it be that you are the law doctor who taught Sun Qian a lesson?

7
00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:21.666
What?

8
00:00:21.666 --> 00:00:22.833
Exactly below

9
00:00:23.766 --> 00:00:25.066
Forgive the little girl's clumsy eyes

10
00:00:25.066 --> 00:00:27.766
If you don't recognize the son, you have to thank the son.

11
00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.400
Why thank me

12
00:00:29.466 --> 00:00:31.366
If it wasn't for the son teaching Sun Qian a lesson

13
00:00:31.466 --> 00:00:34.233
I'm afraid this person will haunt me again

14
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.033
Thank you for writing this poem for Hong Xiu

15
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:42.900
As soon as this poem comes out

16
00:00:42.966 --> 00:00:45.866
Hong Xiu is probably going to be famous all over the world

17
00:00:46.133 --> 00:00:47.333
Poetry doesn't matter

18
00:00:47.333 --> 00:00:48.900
Mainly because I'm curious

19
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.566
What is this Sun Qian doing?

20
00:00:50.566 --> 00:00:52.200
The girl is so disgusted

21
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.033
This person is ridiculous and lustful

22
00:00:54.066 --> 00:00:55.166
malevolent

23
00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:56.700
This girl doesn't like it

24
00:00:56.766 --> 00:00:58.000
Compared to the son

25
00:00:58.266 --> 00:00:59.666
It's a huge difference.

26
00:00:59.866 --> 00:01:01.000
The girl has a great idea

27
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.766
But where did this lustful absurdity come from?

28
00:01:03.766 --> 00:01:05.533
This Sun Qian was born into a famous family

29
00:01:05.533 --> 00:01:07.466
It is normal to ask for flowers and willows

30
00:01:07.466 --> 00:01:08.800
Young Master dies like Murphy

31
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.566
Not for the red sleeves

32
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.066
But don't mean anything else?

33
00:01:13.066 --> 00:01:14.900
What a coincidence

34
00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:15.900
Just happen

35
00:01:16.166 --> 00:01:18.800
It's about an official secret

36
00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.400
Does Mr. Qin want to know?

37
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.833
Oh, of course.

38
00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.066
It's not impossible to want to know

39
00:01:28.333 --> 00:01:29.300
only

40
00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.633
The son needs to pay a price

41
00:01:34.066 --> 00:01:35.033
Red Sleeve Girl

42
00:01:37.966 --> 00:01:38.766
Breeze
