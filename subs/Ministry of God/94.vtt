00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:03.766
But I still advise you to take it easy

2
00:00:03.766 --> 00:00:04.766
otherwise

3
00:00:05.066 --> 00:00:07.866
It's not just a simple matter like the demise of the Qin family

4
00:00:07.866 --> 00:00:11.100
Don't worry, two fists can't beat four hands

5
00:00:11.166 --> 00:00:13.566
It's definitely us who will suffer now

6
00:00:13.566 --> 00:00:14.666
What to do then?

7
00:00:15.166 --> 00:00:17.500
Delay time to see Sun Quan's appearance

8
00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:18.966
Don't know about us yet

9
00:00:18.966 --> 00:00:21.466
As long as someone can be dragged to the criminal department, it will be fine

10
00:00:21.566 --> 00:00:23.833
Why don't you give up?

11
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.633
I also hope that His Majesty can help

12
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.766
You're just pissed off

13
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.666
Stop being delusional

14
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:35.266
Sun Qian, what are you doing here today?

15
00:00:35.266 --> 00:00:37.566
Hahaha, what are you doing here?

16
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.000
Of course it's so blatant to kill you

17
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.533
Aren't you afraid of national laws?

18
00:00:43.533 --> 00:00:45.766
I wanted to write to you

19
00:00:45.766 --> 00:00:47.100
But then I thought about it.

20
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.066
Too lazy to toss

21
00:00:48.266 --> 00:00:50.700
It's better to kill you

22
00:00:51.466 --> 00:00:52.800
Besides, our Sun family

23
00:00:52.866 --> 00:00:55.300
For condemning the dead

24
00:00:55.766 --> 00:00:56.966
Still do it

25
00:00:57.766 --> 00:00:59.400
Blame your Qin family

26
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:00.900
It's not good to offend anyone

27
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:02.300
You must offend our Sun family

28
00:01:02.666 --> 00:01:04.633
court death

29
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.833
Besides, it's a matter of national law

30
00:01:07.933 --> 00:01:10.866
Of course it works for you pariahs

31
00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.233
It's just a decoration for us

32
00:01:15.366 --> 00:01:16.900
This is the situation now

33
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.566
You can't blame me.

34
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.800
Blame it on your fate for being in the wrong fetus

35
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.100
Somebody take it for me
