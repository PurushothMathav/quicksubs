00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.600
Hahahaha

2
00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:04.000
Dr. Qin really lives up to his reputation

3
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.633
But I'm curious

4
00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:09.200
How do you know it's my Sun family and not someone else?

5
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.300
Blame these killers for being too professional

6
00:00:13.566 --> 00:00:16.066
Zhengqing still can't find these people

7
00:00:16.466 --> 00:00:17.600
Except for him

8
00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.100
The only enemy I have is your Sun family

9
00:00:20.766 --> 00:00:22.633
Hahahaha

10
00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:26.400
Interesting, it seems that what the head of the family said is right

11
00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.000
People like you

12
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.133
The extra moment you live is a variable

13
00:00:31.133 --> 00:00:35.700
It seems that you have settled on me today, otherwise?

14
00:00:38.666 --> 00:00:40.466
You go first, I'll protect you

15
00:00:40.466 --> 00:00:41.266
No.

16
00:00:42.066 --> 00:00:44.766
None of us have to leave today.

17
00:00:44.766 --> 00:00:45.833
What do you mean?

18
00:00:47.866 --> 00:00:51.500
General Zhang, have you seen enough of the play?

19
00:00:58.766 --> 00:01:00.966
How did you know I was guessing here?

20
00:01:02.766 --> 00:01:04.233
I finally know now

21
00:01:04.466 --> 00:01:06.200
Why does that person like you so much?

22
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.366
My lord

23
00:01:07.933 --> 00:01:09.266
Criminal Zheng Qing

24
00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.466
Chen Hai Dangying Department

25
00:01:11.566 --> 00:01:13.866
Suspected of murdering court officials

26
00:01:13.933 --> 00:01:15.633
It is the law of the country for me

27
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.600
Somebody take it for me

28
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.400
Don't move!

29
00:01:22.333 --> 00:01:23.633
Is the teacher sick?

30
00:01:25.066 --> 00:01:25.866
Let's go

31
00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.066
Stop in the past

32
00:01:29.166 --> 00:01:30.700
I am from the Cheongju Zheng family

33
00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:31.966
Who dares to touch me?

34
00:01:32.066 --> 00:01:34.400
I am the bodyguard of the present-day Emperor

35
00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.300
In the same way, Zheng Qing, do you think I dare to touch you?

36
00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.466
What Zheng Qing? Zheng Qing

37
00:01:39.466 --> 00:01:40.733
You let me say what you are good at

38
00:01:40.733 --> 00:01:44.166
You don't think about it, Chen Hai wants to kill me

39
00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.433
What's the use of pulling you a weak scholar?

40
00:01:46.733 --> 00:01:49.066
Obviously looking for a scapegoat

41
00:01:49.333 --> 00:01:50.066
this

42
00:01:50.066 --> 00:01:52.366
Something you can come up with as long as you want to break your head

43
00:01:52.366 --> 00:01:54.000
You just can't think of it

44
00:01:54.066 --> 00:01:55.833
I have to rush to commit suicide

45
00:01:56.333 --> 00:01:58.600
Who do you blame?

46
00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:59.500
roll

47
00:02:00.133 --> 00:02:02.366
So you've already thought of this step

48
00:02:02.366 --> 00:02:05.833
Yeah, that's all they can do.

49
00:02:05.866 --> 00:02:08.466
Poisoning, framing, discrediting

50
00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.066
Nothing new.
