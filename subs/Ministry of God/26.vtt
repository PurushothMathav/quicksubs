00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:01.666
Pardon me?

2
00:00:01.966 --> 00:00:03.500
Uncle Qin took the collected evidence

3
00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:04.900
Put it in the secret room of the Chu family

4
00:00:04.933 --> 00:00:07.600
That's right, did you find it?

5
00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:10.466
I originally thought that the thing left by my second uncle

6
00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:12.966
It is a book that records the past of the Chu family

7
00:00:12.966 --> 00:00:16.200
I wanted to use the past to bring down the Sun family

8
00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:18.600
I think it's useless now

9
00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:22.400
Maybe it's fate

10
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.766
But we've almost searched the secret room

11
00:00:24.766 --> 00:00:25.766
Except this.

12
00:00:25.766 --> 00:00:28.166
I didn't find anything else suspicious

13
00:00:28.166 --> 00:00:31.566
Could it be that you missed something? Impossible

14
00:00:31.566 --> 00:00:33.066
We checked carefully

15
00:00:33.066 --> 00:00:34.366
Big brother jumpsuit

16
00:00:36.266 --> 00:00:38.200
Men misunderstand

17
00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:40.200
It's all nonsense from the end of Qin

18
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.300
I am such an upright person

19
00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.266
How could you do such a perverted thing?

20
00:00:48.366 --> 00:00:51.233
If the clue left by the second uncle is not this book

21
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.033
What is that?

22
00:00:59.266 --> 00:01:00.566
Is it that one?

23
00:01:00.766 --> 00:01:01.900
Now what?

24
00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:03.766
Are we going to go back and look for it again?

25
00:01:04.333 --> 00:01:05.166
No, nothing else.

26
00:01:05.166 --> 00:01:08.466
I suspect that all the clues in the secret room have been taken away

27
00:01:08.466 --> 00:01:10.266
How is it possible to take it away?

28
00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.166
I found this book next to it in the secret room

29
00:01:13.266 --> 00:01:14.600
It's been moved.

30
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:15.900
Although I don't know who it is

31
00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.033
But obviously before us

32
00:01:18.133 --> 00:01:21.433
Doesn't that mean the clues are all gone?

33
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.766
I've got a plan.

34
00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:24.733
How?

35
00:01:24.733 --> 00:01:27.766
Go through the idea of chasing the second uncle before and after again

36
00:01:27.766 --> 00:01:30.600
For example, who has he met these days?

37
00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:31.966
Where have you been?

38
00:01:32.266 --> 00:01:34.700
If he can find evidence to turn to the Sun family

39
00:01:34.766 --> 00:01:36.366
There's no reason we can't find it.

40
00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.500
Good way to do it
