00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:01.866
Do you think

2
00:00:02.133 --> 00:00:04.533
Uncle Qin was plotted by me

3
00:00:04.533 --> 00:00:05.566
Otherwise why are you

4
00:00:05.566 --> 00:00:08.300
I have to wait until my second uncle is in a coma to appear

5
00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:10.000
Because when my second uncle was in a coma

6
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.066
No one can prove your identity

7
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.266
You can fish in muddy waters

8
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.433
So that's how you see me, otherwise?

9
00:00:20.966 --> 00:00:22.366
Big brother smokes

10
00:00:22.866 --> 00:00:24.000
It's not poisonous.

11
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.366
Are you sure?

12
00:00:31.766 --> 00:00:33.766
Now that you've checked it out

13
00:00:33.766 --> 00:00:34.966
I will no longer hide

14
00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.100
This is not the place to talk

15
00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:38.600
Let's go to the grey living room

16
00:00:45.533 --> 00:00:48.966
Well, what the hell happened to that cook?

17
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.200
It's not impossible to tell you

18
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.166
But you have to answer me a question first

19
00:00:54.366 --> 00:00:55.300
You say

20
00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.500
Did you ever like me?

21
00:01:05.933 --> 00:01:08.000
My mother was right.

22
00:01:08.566 --> 00:01:11.566
What did God say before his death?

23
00:01:11.566 --> 00:01:13.900
What a liar!

24
00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:17.500
Ah.

25
00:01:18.766 --> 00:01:20.466
What do you mean?

26
00:01:20.466 --> 00:01:21.966
This is too narcissistic

27
00:01:21.966 --> 00:01:23.866
I had to like him.
