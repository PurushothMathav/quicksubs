00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:02.633
Back then, Sun Jiang framed the world

2
00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.466
Selling weapons to the grasslands without permission

3
00:00:04.466 --> 00:00:07.833
But the seller is not doing things, but the Sun family.

4
00:00:07.966 --> 00:00:11.600
It just so happened that the Sun account recorded the transaction

5
00:00:12.166 --> 00:00:14.466
You still have the ledger?

6
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.366
Originally, Sun Jia planned to kill him

7
00:00:24.366 --> 00:00:27.100
But the other party escaped this disaster because of his luck

8
00:00:27.566 --> 00:00:30.200
And also brought out the ledger

9
00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:33.166
Later, the second uncle found this clue

10
00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:34.200
And find each other

11
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.600
But the other party was afraid of the power of the Sun family

12
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:37.800
Refused to come back and identify

13
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.866
So the second uncle brought the ledger back

14
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.500
If I'm not mistaken

15
00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.600
The ledger is in the dry well chamber

16
00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.066
The reason why we didn't find it

17
00:00:46.066 --> 00:00:48.833
It was because it was taken by the Sun family.

18
00:00:48.866 --> 00:00:50.100
Now what?

19
00:00:50.866 --> 00:00:52.966
Don't worry, I've found a new way.

20
00:00:52.966 --> 00:00:54.966
Are you trying to find this person?

21
00:00:54.966 --> 00:00:56.833
Let him personally identify the Sun family

22
00:00:57.266 --> 00:00:59.000
That's right, besides

23
00:00:59.066 --> 00:01:01.700
I've got his address from the traitor

24
00:01:02.066 --> 00:01:06.100
Really, but this needs to be well planned
