00:00:10.933 --> 00:00:13.333
What about my husband? Why hasn't my husband come yet?

2
00:00:13.333 --> 00:00:15.566
My brother has his own work to do

3
00:00:15.566 --> 00:00:18.933
On the contrary, Sister Chu, you had to live by the piano last night

4
00:00:18.933 --> 00:00:21.933
Doesn't Sister Qin have a place to live?

5
00:00:21.933 --> 00:00:23.300
And my sister laughed.

6
00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:24.733
I am my husband's wife

7
00:00:24.733 --> 00:00:27.033
Where else can I live if I don't live in his house?

8
00:00:27.066 --> 00:00:29.700
You hey hey calm down

9
00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:32.233
Calm down. Everyone's here

10
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.800
Don't wait for me, eat now

11
00:00:34.933 --> 00:00:35.733
Hey

12
00:00:36.333 --> 00:00:38.566
Who the hell is sick? Put the snake on my bed

13
00:00:38.566 --> 00:00:40.233
Don't you know that I am most afraid of snakes?

14
00:00:40.266 --> 00:00:42.266
But you can quietly put snakes on my bed

15
00:00:42.266 --> 00:00:44.100
The person who started it might be hiding on the axe

16
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.000
Don't say anything until the investigation is clear

17
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.200
So as not to startle the snake

18
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.700
What were you discussing?

19
00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:51.000
I heard it outside the hospital

20
00:00:51.133 --> 00:00:53.300
What just now?

21
00:00:53.766 --> 00:00:55.400
Uh no

22
00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.300
No husband

23
00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.666
These are my own shrimp.

24
00:00:58.666 --> 00:01:00.000
You try it thank you

25
00:01:00.566 --> 00:01:01.866
Big brother

26
00:01:01.866 --> 00:01:04.800
This is the beef braised by my little sister herself.

27
00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:05.900
They're delicious!

28
00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.066
What's so good about good beef?

29
00:01:08.066 --> 00:01:10.066
My shrimp are healthy and nutritious

30
00:01:10.066 --> 00:01:13.233
My beef keeps me fit

31
00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:14.633
Eat my own

32
00:01:14.733 --> 00:01:16.866
My, my, my.

33
00:01:16.866 --> 00:01:18.000
Oh, that's enough.

34
00:01:18.533 --> 00:01:20.400
Well, I'm going out for a walk.

35
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.033
Eat slowly, bro
