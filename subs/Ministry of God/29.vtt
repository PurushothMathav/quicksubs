00:00:00.533 --> 00:00:02.233
Unexpected

2
00:00:03.866 --> 00:00:06.266
The flowers in the previous life lasted for decades

3
00:00:06.266 --> 00:00:09.066
I am known as the Little Prince of Jianghu Nightclub

4
00:00:09.066 --> 00:00:12.566
One day I will be defeated by a woman

5
00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:16.666
Hey, is that what old people often say?

6
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.300
Retribution?

7
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:20.600
Hey

8
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.366
Big brother, get in

9
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.500
Tell me what's the matter with me

10
00:00:30.066 --> 00:00:31.200
You didn't ask me to investigate my father

11
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:32.400
His whereabouts before the accident?

12
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:33.700
I found out.

13
00:00:33.866 --> 00:00:36.200
My father did meet someone before the accident

14
00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.300
And I've only seen this one person

15
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.366
It's just that this person's identity is a bit big

16
00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:42.900
supervisor

17
00:00:43.333 --> 00:00:45.300
My teacher Guo Zijian

18
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.866
Jianzheng Zhao Shouren

19
00:00:47.666 --> 00:00:49.966
Hmph, it turned out to be him

20
00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.266
Ah shit is the second grade

21
00:00:53.366 --> 00:00:55.066
My second uncle is too awesome

22
00:00:55.066 --> 00:00:56.900
A ninth-grade sesame official knows

23
00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:58.600
A fourth-rank Zhang Ji is fine

24
00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.133
Even the traitor knows

25
00:01:00.133 --> 00:01:02.900
My second uncle shouldn't be a hermit boss, right?

26
00:01:03.333 --> 00:01:04.966
Uh second brother

27
00:01:04.966 --> 00:01:07.133
I remember you were also a student of political abuse, right?

28
00:01:07.133 --> 00:01:08.500
How is your relationship?

29
00:01:08.966 --> 00:01:10.833
Brother, are you kidding me?

30
00:01:10.866 --> 00:01:13.500
We Guo Ziqian are all students who witness adults

31
00:01:13.666 --> 00:01:15.466
You want to say the instrument of mentorship and apprenticeship

32
00:01:15.966 --> 00:01:17.433
I don't have the qualifications

33
00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:18.500
cut

34
00:01:19.266 --> 00:01:20.066
What about others?

35
00:01:20.066 --> 00:01:21.033
How are the people?

36
00:01:22.066 --> 00:01:23.466
I don't know very well.

37
00:01:24.266 --> 00:01:26.266
But the other party gives people the feeling

38
00:01:26.266 --> 00:01:28.433
It's always been that kind of image.

39
00:01:28.466 --> 00:01:30.066
And very modest.

40
00:01:30.366 --> 00:01:32.366
Hmm big brother

41
00:01:32.533 --> 00:01:34.566
Do you want to see the witness in person?

42
00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:36.900
You can do it.

43
00:01:37.533 --> 00:01:38.633
I can't do it.

44
00:01:39.666 --> 00:01:43.800
But I know someone who can do it

45
00:01:44.466 --> 00:01:45.300
he

46
00:01:47.733 --> 00:01:48.533
