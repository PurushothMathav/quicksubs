00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:00.933
What point?

2
00:00:00.933 --> 00:00:04.566
In fact, the tent cloth was not lost.

3
00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:06.800
Here I am.

4
00:00:13.666 --> 00:00:14.766
How is that possible?

5
00:00:15.066 --> 00:00:16.266
If this is true

6
00:00:16.266 --> 00:00:17.566
The book in the secret room

7
00:00:17.966 --> 00:00:19.600
It's also true.

8
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:20.866
But

9
00:00:21.733 --> 00:00:23.366
I copied it by hand

10
00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.433
I specially saved this hand

11
00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:29.100
I wanted to be prepared

12
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.366
I didn't expect

13
00:00:31.766 --> 00:00:33.900
He really needed it that day.

14
00:00:34.066 --> 00:00:35.100
What are you waiting for?

15
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.666
We're going to report him now

16
00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:40.833
What do you mean?

17
00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:42.966
What's the problem?

18
00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.000
My silly son

19
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:45.400
think

20
00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.466
How can it be so easy to be brought down from the first rank

21
00:00:48.733 --> 00:00:50.833
If it were as simple as you say

22
00:00:50.866 --> 00:00:52.666
My father has already reported it.

23
00:00:52.966 --> 00:00:55.000
How could it fall into this field today?

24
00:00:55.366 --> 00:00:57.266
But usually report some officials

25
00:00:57.266 --> 00:00:58.700
Isn't that what you do?

26
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.166
Ordinary officials are right to do so

27
00:01:01.166 --> 00:01:02.800
But Sun Li is the official of the Ministry of Disaster

28
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:03.900
unreached minister

29
00:01:04.066 --> 00:01:06.433
There are countless North Korean and Chinese maids

30
00:01:06.966 --> 00:01:08.866
Unless well-prepared

31
00:01:08.966 --> 00:01:10.600
Suddenly even Emperor Jing

32
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.833
Can't offend him easily

33
00:01:13.366 --> 00:01:16.366
If you dare to take this ledger to the Ministry of Punishment to report it

34
00:01:16.766 --> 00:01:17.733
Do you believe it or not?

35
00:01:17.733 --> 00:01:20.800
The other party will destroy this evidence when they turn around

36
00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.666
Then go to Sun Li to take credit

37
00:01:23.266 --> 00:01:24.600
That's politics.

38
00:01:24.733 --> 00:01:25.966
Also popular

39
00:01:26.733 --> 00:01:28.733
Isn't the eldest brother ordered to investigate the case?

40
00:01:28.733 --> 00:01:30.800
We can directly pass the traitor lord

41
00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.300
Present it to the Emperor

42
00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:34.600
No way.

43
00:01:35.533 --> 00:01:38.000
Just an old story from more than a decade ago

44
00:01:38.133 --> 00:01:39.800
Even if His Majesty attacks

45
00:01:39.866 --> 00:01:41.800
It's hard to do anything about Sun Li

46
00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.233
At that time, a large number of North Korean and Chinese officials will try to ensure

47
00:01:47.166 --> 00:01:50.500
In the end, it would be good to demote Tafalu

48
00:01:51.333 --> 00:01:54.633
The big deal is some painless results

49
00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:58.500
Maybe I have a way
