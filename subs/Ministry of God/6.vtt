00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:04.400
Help! Help! Help! Help!

2
00:00:06.366 --> 00:00:09.233
Breeze, you are an adult

3
00:00:09.666 --> 00:00:10.700
well known

4
00:00:10.733 --> 00:00:13.466
The smoke from the fire was hot and dry

5
00:00:13.466 --> 00:00:15.300
If you inhale a large amount before death

6
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:18.166
It must leave a mark in the throat

7
00:00:18.566 --> 00:00:19.666
That is to say

8
00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:22.266
The two men did not die in the fire

9
00:00:22.266 --> 00:00:24.100
But before the fire

10
00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:26.000
Died unexpectedly

11
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.566
What? And according to the file

12
00:00:29.566 --> 00:00:32.600
My second uncle Qin Yuantu is stealing property

13
00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:33.900
Arson

14
00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.633
Waterfall waiter Zhang Ji and his eldest son

15
00:00:36.733 --> 00:00:39.300
He died in the sea of fire

16
00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:43.166
What if the two died before the fire?

17
00:00:43.166 --> 00:00:44.766
Adults even so

18
00:00:44.766 --> 00:00:46.766
Even those with their own eyes can't wash away the salted fish.

19
00:00:47.133 --> 00:00:48.700
After he parted ways with my father

20
00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:50.933
In a hurry, I went to set a fire

21
00:00:50.933 --> 00:00:52.066
Maybe he killed someone first

22
00:00:52.066 --> 00:00:53.966
The fire was just set to drown the evidence, my lord

23
00:00:53.966 --> 00:00:55.100
Destruction of evidence

24
00:00:55.466 --> 00:00:56.366
Mr. Zhang

25
00:00:56.466 --> 00:00:58.533
Then let me ask you another question. What question?

26
00:00:58.533 --> 00:01:01.366
Since it was my second uncle who killed your father and then set it on fire

27
00:01:01.366 --> 00:01:04.200
Then how did your brother die?

28
00:01:04.866 --> 00:01:07.166
There's no smoke in your brother's throat

29
00:01:07.166 --> 00:01:10.066
Which means it wasn't a fire either

30
00:01:10.066 --> 00:01:11.400
And according to the dossier

31
00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.366
After my second uncle came to Zhang Mansion

32
00:01:13.366 --> 00:01:15.566
Stayed in the room of the deceased

33
00:01:15.566 --> 00:01:17.000
After the second uncle leaves

34
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.400
That's when the fire started

35
00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:22.200
This is the confirmation process with Lord Fu Yin just now.

36
00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.900
That's right, then I'll ask you again

37
00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.300
Who killed your brother?
