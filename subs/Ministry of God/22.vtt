00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:03.066
Oops bro

2
00:00:03.133 --> 00:00:04.500
What happened in such a hurry?

3
00:00:04.933 --> 00:00:06.366
Chu Shuhan has a problem with her identity

4
00:00:06.366 --> 00:00:07.300
How is that possible?

5
00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:08.400
If there is a problem with his identity

6
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.000
Could it be that Mr. Jin Zheng doesn't know?

7
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.600
It's true. I just got the news.

8
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:14.100
Chu Shuhan is the one who lived the world back then

9
00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:17.566
What was it that the second uncle led the troops to destroy the whole family?

10
00:00:17.566 --> 00:00:19.366
How could the other party not come for revenge?

11
00:00:19.366 --> 00:00:21.200
Even I doubt the second preview

12
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:22.700
It's not what the Sun family said at all

13
00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:24.100
It was Chu Shuhan who did it

14
00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:25.000
How is that possible?

15
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.533
Not so much for now.

16
00:00:26.533 --> 00:00:28.100
It's important to find Yu'er

17
00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:29.666
Then let's find it separately.

18
00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.200
Brother Qin Yue

19
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.166
Your kitchen knife at home is broken.

20
00:00:45.166 --> 00:00:46.966
I'm out looking for someone to fix it

21
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.600
By the way, big brother, why were you so excited just now?

22
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:50.833
What's up?

23
00:00:51.466 --> 00:00:52.300
What about Chu Chuhan?

24
00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:54.700
He just said that there are still things left in the mansion

25
00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:56.033
I want to go back and pick it up.

26
00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:00.166
Brother, you didn't make a special trip to find him, did you?

27
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.266
Chu Chuhan is home

28
00:01:03.266 --> 00:01:05.366
Yeah, what's wrong?

29
00:01:05.366 --> 00:01:07.900
It's not good to be so coincidental, second uncle
