00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:02.066
Doctor, how is my second uncle?

2
00:00:02.066 --> 00:00:04.400
Lord Qin is a very rare giant

3
00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:05.566
The old man has tried his best

4
00:00:05.566 --> 00:00:07.466
As for when he wakes up

5
00:00:11.966 --> 00:00:15.266
Damn it, don't let me know who he is

6
00:00:15.333 --> 00:00:17.166
Otherwise, I won't let him go.

7
00:00:17.766 --> 00:00:19.666
How deep does it involve sleeping in the dark?

8
00:00:19.733 --> 00:00:21.366
Zhang Ji is a second-rank official

9
00:00:21.366 --> 00:00:22.900
As a result, the Zhang family died

10
00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:24.566
Now it's my Qin family's turn

11
00:00:24.566 --> 00:00:26.100
I just received the decree

12
00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:29.166
How is the second minister?

13
00:00:29.166 --> 00:00:30.433
Taking care of my dad

14
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.233
Big brother, what happened?

15
00:00:33.533 --> 00:00:35.966
Why was my father poisoned?

16
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.100
Could this be Zhang Qiang?

17
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:38.900
Will not

18
00:00:39.466 --> 00:00:40.400
Just got the news.

19
00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.566
Zhang Zhijie has died tragically for breeding

20
00:00:42.566 --> 00:00:45.100
What Zhang Zhijie died

21
00:00:45.166 --> 00:00:46.133
How is that possible?

22
00:00:46.133 --> 00:00:48.833
The people involved in the sex tax camp case didn't end well

23
00:00:48.866 --> 00:00:52.033
It's better not to let them know about this.

24
00:00:52.133 --> 00:00:53.566
I remember something.

25
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.400
This was left to me by my father when he was caught

26
00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.700
What else did the second uncle say?

27
00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.033
organ box

28
00:01:02.766 --> 00:01:05.366
Father Murphy preview is related to this thing

29
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.500
Maybe, but how do I open this?

30
00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.100
Hey don't look at me

31
00:01:11.266 --> 00:01:12.866
I am a reader

32
00:01:12.866 --> 00:01:14.033
Won't unlock

33
00:01:16.766 --> 00:01:17.700
Could it be that

34
00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.500
It is related to the clues left by the second uncle's investigation of the tax and bank case

35
00:01:20.733 --> 00:01:22.500
This is obviously a hot potato

36
00:01:22.866 --> 00:01:25.366
The other party may also be here for this

37
00:01:25.866 --> 00:01:27.066
What do you mean, bro?

38
00:01:27.066 --> 00:01:28.900
I'll give you this box.
