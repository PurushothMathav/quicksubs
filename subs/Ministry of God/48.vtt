1
00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:05.066
These bastards are clearly framing big brother

2
00:00:05.266 --> 00:00:07.200
Sister-in-law, what should we do now?

3
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.266
You can't just watch your big brother wait to die like this

4
00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.266
No, I'm going back to move reinforcements

5
00:00:14.266 --> 00:00:15.733
Stop what do you think

6
00:00:15.733 --> 00:00:16.700
Now in the capital

7
00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.966
Anyone?

8
00:00:16.966 --> 00:00:19.333
Will help them at the risk of being angered by the Sun family

9
00:00:19.333 --> 00:00:20.300
What to do then?

10
00:00:20.566 --> 00:00:20.933
You can't.

11
00:00:20.933 --> 00:00:23.400
Just watch big brother being played to death by the Sun family

12
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:24.800
before the time

13
00:00:25.066 --> 00:00:26.366
Only believe him

14
00:00:26.666 --> 00:00:27.866
My eldest brother

15
00:00:28.866 --> 00:00:31.600
This is what he put in my hand before they took him.

16
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.233
within the plan

17
00:00:34.266 --> 00:00:35.500
Don't worry.

18
00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:36.966
How is this possible?

19
00:00:37.366 --> 00:00:40.266
Don't look at your big brother's usual giggling

20
00:00:40.266 --> 00:00:41.666
A cynical look

21
00:00:41.766 --> 00:00:43.666
But in fact, he was more afraid of death than anyone else

22
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.000
Fear of death

23
00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:47.800
It is because he is afraid of death

24
00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.766
So he thinks more than anyone else

25
00:00:49.766 --> 00:00:50.866
Also more cautious

26
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:52.866
only

27
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.400
I can't imagine what he left behind

28
00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:59.066
Go where

29
00:00:59.933 --> 00:01:00.866
County
