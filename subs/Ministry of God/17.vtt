00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:01.066
I go ahead

2
00:00:01.066 --> 00:00:02.900
You follow me

3
00:00:03.333 --> 00:00:04.966
This wavering should have been excavated by humans

4
00:00:04.966 --> 00:00:07.300
And it should be a long time.

5
00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:09.200
You can see that.

6
00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.200
When is he so smart?

7
00:00:12.566 --> 00:00:13.533
Oops bro

8
00:00:13.533 --> 00:00:15.533
Why did you suddenly stop?

9
00:00:15.533 --> 00:00:16.600
There's no way out.

10
00:00:17.066 --> 00:00:19.333
Why is it so good that there is suddenly no way?

11
00:00:19.333 --> 00:00:20.400
There should be an agency

12
00:00:20.566 --> 00:00:22.400
Why oh crap

13
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.933
No mechanism

14
00:00:22.933 --> 00:00:25.166
Who has nothing to do to build such a long tunnel at the bottom of the well?

15
00:00:25.166 --> 00:00:25.966
OK

16
00:00:25.966 --> 00:00:28.266
Isn't he fragrant if he has the money and energy to visit the kiln?

17
00:00:28.266 --> 00:00:29.966
That makes sense. Okay.

18
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.433
Find the agency, okay?

19
00:00:35.166 --> 00:00:36.766
I seem to have found it.

20
00:00:36.766 --> 00:00:38.966
Really? So fast? Wow.

21
00:00:40.566 --> 00:00:43.066
You said the people involved in this agency

22
00:00:43.066 --> 00:00:44.566
Are you insulting our intelligence?

23
00:00:44.566 --> 00:00:45.466
This is not a trap.

24
00:00:45.466 --> 00:00:46.566
Hey, why are you here?

25
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:50.600
How is that possible?

26
00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.800
It turned out to be
