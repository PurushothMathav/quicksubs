00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.100
aunt

2
00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:03.500
I brought you the porridge cooked in the kitchen.

3
00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:07.000
Thank you

4
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:08.666
Thank you

5
00:00:08.666 --> 00:00:10.566
If it weren't for greasy and melodious

6
00:00:10.566 --> 00:00:12.366
I'm afraid this family has long since broken up

7
00:00:12.366 --> 00:00:13.900
Auntie, what are you talking about?

8
00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:15.700
This is what I should do.

9
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.600
I saw that bowl of porridge was cold just now.

10
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.900
So I had the kitchen reheat another bowl.

11
00:00:20.933 --> 00:00:25.233
You can feed it to uncle, thank you.

12
00:00:28.366 --> 00:00:30.066
Can't feed, husband

13
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.433
This porridge is not drinkable

14
00:00:31.933 --> 00:00:34.166
Why can't you drink this porridge? It's poisonous.

15
00:00:34.666 --> 00:00:37.633
What empress

16
00:00:46.133 --> 00:00:47.733
What the hell is going on?

17
00:00:47.733 --> 00:00:50.366
You have to ask him about it.

18
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:54.000
Husband, what do you mean by that?

19
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.766
Are you still playing dumb with me?

20
00:00:55.866 --> 00:00:57.066
You are my uncle

21
00:00:57.066 --> 00:00:59.333
Hedong who led the troops to kill the descendants

22
00:00:59.333 --> 00:01:01.366
Chu Shuhan, am I right?

23
00:01:01.366 --> 00:01:02.900
Handong business
