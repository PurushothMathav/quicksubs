1
00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:01.900
How?

2
00:00:02.566 --> 00:00:03.800
Killing with a knife

3
00:00:04.966 --> 00:00:06.366
Actually think about it

4
00:00:06.466 --> 00:00:07.766
The court is so big

5
00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:10.000
How can there really be a dominant family?

6
00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:11.600
That's all there is to it.

7
00:00:11.733 --> 00:00:13.333
If he took it all

8
00:00:13.333 --> 00:00:14.900
It will definitely cause dissatisfaction among others.

9
00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:16.200
If we take the knife

10
00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.800
Give it to those who are dissatisfied with Sun Li

11
00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:20.766
What do you think will happen?

12
00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:22.633
Good idea. Hmm.

13
00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:26.066
Yes, this move can not only deflect the hatred of the Sun family

14
00:00:26.066 --> 00:00:27.233
Preserve yourself

15
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:30.066
At the same time, it can also take the opportunity to eradicate the Sun family

16
00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:32.033
Best of both worlds.

17
00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.166
You think too simply.

18
00:00:34.766 --> 00:00:38.300
How could anyone offend the Sun family with nothing to do?

19
00:00:38.333 --> 00:00:39.900
Isn't this courting death?

20
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:40.833
second uncle

21
00:00:41.366 --> 00:00:42.700
That's where you get it wrong.

22
00:00:42.866 --> 00:00:44.533
As the so-called easy meridian

23
00:00:44.533 --> 00:00:47.433
The reason why all things are attached to Sun Li

24
00:00:47.666 --> 00:00:50.466
It's just that Sun Li will bring them benefits

25
00:00:50.466 --> 00:00:51.700
If you take down Sun Li

26
00:00:51.966 --> 00:00:53.866
It will bring them more benefits

27
00:00:54.733 --> 00:00:57.300
Do you think they would do that?

28
00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.433
The reason why everyone is kind

29
00:01:00.666 --> 00:01:03.833
It's just that you don't have full confidence to take down the opponent

30
00:01:04.133 --> 00:01:05.600
If we can find

31
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.200
The decisive evidence to bring down Sun Li

32
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:12.233
How many people do you think Sun Li will die?

33
00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:14.800
But where are we going to find so much evidence?

34
00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.400
Just a book from the accounting department more than ten years ago

35
00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.100
It almost wiped us out

36
00:01:19.566 --> 00:01:21.233
If you find a few more

37
00:01:21.466 --> 00:01:24.100
Then our Qin family must not die

38
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.433
What do you mean?

39
00:01:26.966 --> 00:01:28.766
Shut your mouth if you can't speak

40
00:01:28.866 --> 00:01:30.766
The worst way to say anything nice

41
00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.133
But am I telling the truth?

42
00:01:33.133 --> 00:01:36.466
The evidence of Sun Li's old thing may be hard to find

43
00:01:36.466 --> 00:01:38.433
But not necessarily his son

44
00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.033
You mean Sun Quan yes

45
00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.366
Let you lie to me and threaten me

46
00:01:45.366 --> 00:01:47.366
If I don't take your shit out this time

47
00:01:47.366 --> 00:01:48.500
Lao Tzu is not surnamed Qin
