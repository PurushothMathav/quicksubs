00:00:00.766 --> 00:00:01.700
Wow

2
00:00:02.866 --> 00:00:04.466
Is this ancient times?

3
00:00:05.333 --> 00:00:07.600
And beautiful women

4
00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:09.400
Wow no

5
00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:10.466
Have to be steady

6
00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:13.766
Humph trash

7
00:00:14.266 --> 00:00:15.900
Who are you so incompetent?

8
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.400
Didn't your father teach you to be polite?

9
00:00:18.466 --> 00:00:21.966
I am the son of Lang Zhangji in the Ministry of Household

10
00:00:21.966 --> 00:00:23.566
So your father is dead

11
00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:25.900
No wonder it's okay for you.

12
00:00:28.866 --> 00:00:29.700
Sujing

13
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.266
This is the courthouse

14
00:00:32.533 --> 00:00:35.433
Who dares to speak wildly here

15
00:00:36.133 --> 00:00:38.100
Pulled out to fight the second division

16
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.100
The police just said

17
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.600
You already know the truth of the case

18
00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:44.866
I mean it.

19
00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:45.866
Naturally serious

20
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.333
The officer will give you a chance

21
00:00:49.333 --> 00:00:51.366
You tell the truth

22
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.133
If it expires

23
00:00:53.133 --> 00:00:56.233
That officer will chop off your head immediately

24
00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.633
I dare not, but before Lord Zhou solves the case

25
00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.833
Caomin has a few things I want to confirm with you. You said

26
00:01:04.066 --> 00:01:05.400
According to the dossier

27
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.666
After my second uncle came to Zhang Mansion

28
00:01:07.666 --> 00:01:09.866
Never left the Yoshima of the dead

29
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.700
After my uncle leaves

30
00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.800
That's when the fire started

31
00:01:14.466 --> 00:01:17.666
And accidentally burned Zhang Jiazi, who lived in the next yard

32
00:01:17.666 --> 00:01:18.933
Yeah, it's good.

33
00:01:18.933 --> 00:01:21.666
Then why is everyone so sure about this fire?

34
00:01:21.766 --> 00:01:23.500
It must have been put by my second uncle

35
00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.366
No, have you read the dossier?

36
00:01:26.366 --> 00:01:28.300
The government believes that your second uncle is the murderer

37
00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:30.766
It wasn't the fire that started when he left.

38
00:01:30.766 --> 00:01:33.700
But someone saw him set the fire with their own eyes. Who?

39
00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.700
Why can't you?

40
00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.000
Only you see it.

41
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.800
Or did other people around you see it too?

42
00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.333
Why am I alone?

43
00:01:41.333 --> 00:01:42.300
Why does it matter?

44
00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:43.100
Not important

45
00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:44.800
It's incredibly important.

46
00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.866
What did this Qin Feng hit?

47
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.233
Do you have any questions?

48
00:01:52.566 --> 00:01:55.200
No, who is the murderer?
