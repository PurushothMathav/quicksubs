00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:05.670
You are not you, because you should not let too many people out.

2
00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:09.350
When I was young, my love grew thin,

3
00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.910
You killed my child, and I feel like a wild man.

4
00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:14.410
What's going on?

5
00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:17.330
You, what are you laughing at?

6
00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:20.300
Let's walk together. Can you hold your hand over there?

7
00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.640
When your heartbeat gets better, I'll make you crash.

8
00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:31.670
Come in, why are you here?

9
00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:34.790
Sincerely, you killed my child!

10
00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:38.250
There is no one else standing

11
00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.230
Just me and you

12
00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:40.610
Stop being in this state

13
00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:43.620
Others will be though

14
00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:46.600
Is the feeling of distress uncomfortable? Lin Jing'er

15
00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.360
You returned the line to me over and over again

16
00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.660
what do you want to do

17
00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:52.280
It won't just make your life difficult

18
00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:53.980
Who forced you to live?

19
00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:55.240
Since his time

20
00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.290
Not a vegetarian for me

21
00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:00.250
This is what you owe me
