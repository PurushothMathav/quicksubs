00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:07.130
Machine, there are many, many, many differences,

2
00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:09.130
What are you doing?

3
00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:12.060
You can't say it?

4
00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:14.940
I can't tell you apart, I'm very tired, I don't have time to accompany you and give up the circle,

5
00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:17.690
What hurts you to tell me directly?

6
00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:21.370
Thank you, I will also let you give it to you.

7
00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:25.720
Machine, I've been fucking you for so many years.

8
00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:29.120
At that time, because you were sure to meet someone as soon as you came in,

9
00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.680
I can't find him as soon as I meet him, after so many years,

10
00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.830
I misunderstood again and again, I'm sorry.

11
00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:37.340
Machines have happened.

12
00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:39.740
No matter how much you say, you can't get over it. You hurt me back then.

13
00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.660
Machine, you are always in my heart.

14
00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:43.480
Itâ€™s just that you have to pay for it,

15
00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:50.430
When I was looking forward to asking for a mother

16
00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:51.510
Buying yourself

17
00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.250
How about we start over?

18
00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:56.460
You hear nothing

19
00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:57.940
Start over with them

20
00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:01.990
Listen, listen, listen, listen

21
00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.970
Listen, listen, listen, listen

22
00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:03.630
Listen, listen, listen, listen

23
00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:04.840
Listen, listen, listen, listen

24
00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:04.959
Listen, listen, listen, listen

25
00:01:04.959 --> 00:01:07.230
Listen, listen, listen, listen

26
00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:07.530
Listen, listen, listen, listen
