00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:02.560
Mom, am I okay?

2
00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:07.570
Thank you Uncle Lin.

3
00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:09.920
Thank you, we...

4
00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:13.090
Are you a bad person or something?

5
00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:16.000
My parents must be worried about it now.

6
00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:21.640
It is our factual expectation to make the best of everything.

7
00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:24.860
An Ansi’s expectation is that he is not suitable for going abroad.

8
00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:27.140
Why doesn't it fit?

9
00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:30.420
After we go abroad, we can click An'an to find a better psychological life.

10
00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:34.620
An'an, isn't this what's wrong with you now?

11
00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.360
Thank you. Are you okay with your parents?

12
00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:46.500
Maybe. Today’s children who have the mentality to give you the mentality and the heart and brain don’t know how to understand.

13
00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:52.620
I don’t know if we can

14
00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.800
It's not a good time to go up and eat now

15
00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.060
I've decided everything

16
00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:00.140
What a peace of mind for you

17
00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:02.420
Every day at 12 noon

18
00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:03.220
I'll keep going up
