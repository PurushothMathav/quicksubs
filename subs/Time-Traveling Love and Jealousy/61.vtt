00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:02.240
Are you a dear friend?

2
00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:03.980
I have Enron.

3
00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:05.700
I'll invest in your company.

4
00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:09.820
Why do you have so much money?

5
00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.380
I withdrew the money.

6
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.660
Dear, I'm not short of money.

7
00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:21.560
There's 10 million of them.

8
00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.980
Tomorrow, another 50 million will arrive.

9
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.540
Don't reject me.

10
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.080
Honey, get it.

11
00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:30.480
The doctor said you have bad teeth.

12
00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.280
Marry me will eat soft eat you.

13
00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:33.560
I see your teeth are not good.

14
00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:34.680
It has been withdrawn for you.

15
00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.400
Everything you say now has no voice.

16
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.380
Don't blame me for talking.

17
00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:40.940
I'm just curious.

18
00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:44.540
You say you're so rich, why just Ran Ran?

19
00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:46.560
I can too.

20
00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:47.680
Hey, we all can.

21
00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:52.120
Hey, yes, yes, yes, we all can, we all can, sister, I see you're gone.

22
00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:53.460
What does that have to do with you?

23
00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.500
That's great.

24
00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.020
I'm serious.

25
00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.120
Let me invest in your company.

26
00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:00.440
So is my intention.

27
00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.660
Although I'm a slightly older investor.

28
00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:05.980
But luckily, the temperament wasn't bad.

29
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.500
Even if you lose money, you won't send it.

30
00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.600
Sister-in-law, you really want to invest in our company.

31
00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.080
Now we don't even have a limit for one game.

32
00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:13.940
Maybe.

33
00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:15.740
It's burning money.

34
00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.160
It's okay.

35
00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:19.700
It's all burned, I'll replenish it for you.

36
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.900
Tomorrow, you will have your lawyer sign an investment contract with you.

37
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.900
Try not to delay your initial game time limit.

38
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.020
There are no stupid investors like you.

39
00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.940
Of course our child's dreams must be well fed?

40
00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.440
Hello, Miss Xu, right?

41
00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:47.880
I'm Xiao Nhien's mother.

42
00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.180
Let's meet.
