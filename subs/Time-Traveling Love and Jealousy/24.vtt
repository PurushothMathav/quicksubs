00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:02.160
Do you really want to kill me now?

2
00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:02.980
Don't worry.

3
00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:05.460
Let me finish with a few questions.

4
00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.860
How to delay your time is bad.

5
00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:11.120
But because I'm here

6
00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:12.700
Nature is fully prepared.

7
00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:16.900
This needle goes down 10 minutes and dies.

8
00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:18.900
Anyway.

9
00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:20.180
You're going to die here today.

10
00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:25.360
Ten minutes is enough.

11
00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:27.760
Ask what you want to ask before you die.

12
00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:32.180
I heard that when Fu Siyan was young, he lived in a slum.

13
00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.300
Not enough to eat, not warm.

14
00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.260
You're a young girl

15
00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.540
I happened to walk through the slums once.

16
00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.540
Helped Bosyan at the time.

17
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:43.940
Invite him to a meal.

18
00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:46.820
What does it have to do with you?

19
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.560
I'm just curious what you're doing in the slums.

20
00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:54.020
How do you know if you were being bullied by someone else?

21
00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:55.420
I've been hungry for days.

22
00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:59.460
Or maybe it's all been arranged a long time ago.

23
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.200
Just waiting for the beautiful actress to save the hero.

24
00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.860
Your question is stupid.

25
00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:08.060
Of course I knew he was the Silver family's son.

26
00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:09.760
Okay, time's up.

27
00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:11.180
Should get you on your way.

28
00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.320
Burn her for five times 10 million.

29
00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:16.260
Haha.

30
00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.000
Beauty, it's not up to me.

31
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.140
I can only say.

32
00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:22.680
Your life is not good.

33
00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:23.960
If the body is burned

34
00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:25.160
The mission will be interrupted.

35
00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:27.080
I'm never coming back.

36
00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:28.660
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

37
00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.500
I'm dead this time.

38
00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:36.580
Stop!
