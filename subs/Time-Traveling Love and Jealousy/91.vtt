00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.020
Why should I sacrifice my life for a man?

2
00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:04.640
Let me eat healthy

3
00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:05.980
Marry a family and reach the top

4
00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.060
I'm afraid I won't find a good husband

5
00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:11.540
Awake

6
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:16.420
Then since the process is not important to you at all

7
00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.580
Why did you answer him and go away?

8
00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.380
Why would you betray your child?

9
00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:26.580
That's because he seems like the best man I know so far

10
00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:29.160
Besides, he doesn't belong to you

11
00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.220
What can I possibly not love that which belongs to me?

12
00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:33.860
So

13
00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:35.300
Don't love you

14
00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.440
You can say that

15
00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.320
As long as you are willing to give me your kidney

16
00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.260
I will never communicate with him

17
00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.820
If not too violated

18
00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:44.860
Let my life be ordinary and die

19
00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.020
Wow, such a heavy thing.

20
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.300
Then it seems that the process is not important to you at all.

21
00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:54.700
I only love yourself

22
00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.000
Since you believe me

23
00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.700
So let's move on to the money thing

24
00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:01.760
I have discussed it with my parents

25
00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.280
As long as you dare to turn around and give it to me

26
00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:04.700
We can try

27
00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:07.100
The price is good.

28
00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.300
If you don't work at International Blackstone, you can't find a life that suits you

29
00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:14.840
I'm afraid you will too

30
00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:15.780
So big.

31
00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.220
You are not satisfied with such good conditions.

32
00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:20.420
It's just a kidney and you won't die

33
00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:22.940
You can also get your dream husband and huge money

34
00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:26.500
You have to know that this is something that many people can't dream of

35
00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:28.820
What if I said

36
00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.900
By the way, this paragraph you mentioned just now, colleague

37
00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.060
I have sent it.
