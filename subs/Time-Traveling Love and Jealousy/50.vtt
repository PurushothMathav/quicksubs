00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:03.500
You're listening to us.

2
00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:07.580
Oh, I'm sending you a message.

3
00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:09.060
Let him take it down.

4
00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:10.240
Don't you need it?

5
00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:11.420
Just bought a lot.

6
00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:13.540
What do you usually do with female items?

7
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:15.340
Buy for cigarettes.

8
00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:17.020
Oh.

9
00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.280
I'll go to the rest room first.

10
00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:22.340
I'm going to see the basic course with you tomorrow.

11
00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:29.760
Shuyeon was a benefactor of mine as a child.

12
00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.580
He took me to my biological parents.

13
00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:36.540
He's the equivalent of a distant cousin of mine.

14
00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.300
This mosquito is...

15
00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:42.820
The real beauty.

16
00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:49.300
Laughing at what?

17
00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:53.820
Mother-in-law.

18
00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:55.820
Am I a big kid?

19
00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:57.460
That's great.

20
00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.900
My mother-in-law went back to college.

21
00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:02.260
It's not children.

22
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.420
The boy.

23
00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.660
No matter how old you are, you are a child.

24
00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.580
Granny, do you remember me?

25
00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.940
You are my name, the library.

26
00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.200
That year was when I saved my lover from Ta's house, when I was a child.

27
00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:21.540
Not working enough.

28
00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.180
Not taking into account how you feel

29
00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:24.740
Over the years.

30
00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:26.540
Sorry to bother you.

31
00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:28.320
Is that you?

32
00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.340
Little girl, have you had any plastic surgery?

33
00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.020
Why not like that year?
