00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:06.300
Buy it for your girlfriend?

2
00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:07.940
Which one is better?

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.060
Here you go.

4
00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.940
This is thin and breathable.

5
00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:14.060
Are you satisfied with buying this for your girlfriend's bag?

6
00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:17.520
Payment

7
00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.420
Last year's information was all on the 60th.

8
00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.260
The boss took another cake.

9
00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:49.540
The door's unlocked.

10
00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.140
Yes, you bought the cake.

11
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.540
It's my birthday.

12
00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:03.220
Can I have some?

13
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:04.400
What a coincidence.

14
00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:06.100
Happy birthday.

15
00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:07.500
Thank you.

16
00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.740
Can this burn hot water?

17
00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:11.780
What?

18
00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.980
Worried about me, I'm worried you didn't take me to find Mrs. Chicken.

19
00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:18.620
I won't regret it.

20
00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.100
Let's rest today, we'll go tomorrow.

21
00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.160
Okay.

22
00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.060
Then you drink plenty of hot water.

23
00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:36.340
Cakes are easy to buy.

24
00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:37.580
There are no birthday candles.

25
00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.420
This little program can blow out candles and wishes

26
00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.460
Host, what are you laughing at?

27
00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:48.300
Little That

28
00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.420
I don't understand, brother.
