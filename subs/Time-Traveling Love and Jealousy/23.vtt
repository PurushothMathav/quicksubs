00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:00.932
beauty

2
00:00:00.932 --> 00:00:02.080
Here I come.

3
00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:03.220
OK

4
00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.300
Yeah, what are you doing?

5
00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:08.420
Even if you call it a dog

6
00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:10.600
No one came

7
00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:14.380
Look at this land, it's already deserted

8
00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:17.540
Besides, the louder you scream

9
00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:19.300
The more excited I get

10
00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:23.580
Ah, um, call it uh

11
00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:26.380
Is the person who ordered you to kidnap me Yoyo Mu?

12
00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:27.980
Trying to trick me

13
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.060
No way.

14
00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.100
I already know where I need to talk to you

15
00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:37.980
I just wanted to remind you that Yoshiki Yoshio that woman put you together

16
00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:39.799
She's on your phone.

17
00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:41.200
With a tracker

18
00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:42.020
That's not possible.

19
00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.233
Mu is playing a fool

20
00:00:49.233 --> 00:00:50.840
It's not that I don't trust you.

21
00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:52.300
She wants to kill two birds with one stone

22
00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.080
You finish her job

23
00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:55.860
She will call the police to arrest you again

24
00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.420
How perfect to save even hiring

25
00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:00.600
Whatever.

26
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.900
I'll be cool first, and then I'll go to that guy surnamed Mo to settle accounts

27
00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.720
Is Xiaoqiki Yoyo coming soon?

28
00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.900
It's already at the gate of the garage.

29
00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:11.340
Good. Let's begin.

30
00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.100
Fang Qi, what are you doing?

31
00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:14.520
Why did you call me here?

32
00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.700
What the hell are you doing here?

33
00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:18.860
Miss Mu

34
00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:20.180
I called you here.

35
00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:23.180
Xiaoqi, help me turn on the phone recording.

36
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.080
Don't you care about me?

37
00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.040
Send someone to follow me every day

38
00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.500
Then I should care about you too

39
00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:31.940
That's reciprocity.

40
00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.960
you
