00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:09.100
You can finally call me baby.

2
00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:12.340
You remember?

3
00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:16.660
The day we first met?

4
00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:18.500
Remember.

5
00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:20.260
More than the first time.

6
00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:22.820
Oh.

7
00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.820
Sir, I've been beaten.

8
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.680
Want to go to the night called crazy

9
00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.540
- Who's that?

10
00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.420
What if that's the case?

11
00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:34.180
It must be you.

12
00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.340
Don't come down here looking for death.

13
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.100
Excuse me.

14
00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.420
Can't give me hope

15
00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:47.260
I want to.

16
00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:49.260
I love you.

17
00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:53.700
Don't tell him.

18
00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.660
Can't get your happiness

19
00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.380
If love forgets

20
00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.860
Just let him go.

21
00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.980
I let him come in my place.

22
00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:30.500
I'll still think about him.

23
00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:34.900
We'll be together in the next life.

24
00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:37.100
Not just the next life.

25
00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.620
And the next life.

26
00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:43.420
Next Life

27
00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:46.660
Oh, sorry.

28
00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:56.900
I can't remember.

29
00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:59.820
What is life like?

30
00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:01.780
There's no sugar.

31
00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:03.440
Back off.

32
00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:16.960
Congratulations to the owner on completing the task.

33
00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.980
Sue, don't erase your memory right away.

34
00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:21.860
Wait a minute.

35
00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.000
Wait a minute.

36
00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:45.880
To protect the mental health of the host

37
00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:47.820
It's about to clear the memory of the host.

38
00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:50.280
Ding Dong Bound Job

39
00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.500
The new mission world is opening up.
