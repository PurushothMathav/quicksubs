00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:04.260
Honey, I have to go to the office.

2
00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:05.940
Wait for me to come back

3
00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.660
Drive safely

4
00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:18.160
Xiaoqi

5
00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.860
It disappears for an hour or two every day recently.

6
00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:21.900
So suspicious

7
00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:23.460
Help me check his whereabouts

8
00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:29.540
The host Blackheart Pool is now injecting itself every day with a potion that can cause temporary memory loss

9
00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:32.900
During this time, the Black Star Pool will forget the host, you.

10
00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.820
Is this the true love of eating and drinking to me? The pool has been kept at 99.

11
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.000
So far it seems yes

12
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.840
Stephen Chow will forget your host for a period of time every day

13
00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:46.680
So that true love doesn't overflow

14
00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:47.840
The mission is not over

15
00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.160
You won't leave

16
00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.260
He's fighting the space system

17
00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.540
But why?

18
00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.240
The side effects of this medicine are very large

19
00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:58.740
He's destroying himself.

20
00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:11.720
Baby

21
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:13.780
How did you get out?

22
00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:23.460
Outside

23
00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:27.220
You should have told me earlier

24
00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.340
We face it together

25
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.500
I knew I couldn't hide it from you for long

26
00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.860
But I do this.

27
00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:40.060
There's a reason I have to do it

28
00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.940
Can you stop persuading me?

29
00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:46.180
I won't stop you

30
00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.460
You don't even ask me why

31
00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.220
Whatever you want to do

32
00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:52.060
I support you.

33
00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.420
Which of these three worlds do you like best?

34
00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:00.540
I like you.

35
00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.980
Guess Her Majesty the Queen

36
00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:06.940
The current task difficulty coefficient cannot stimulate His Highness' large-scale deep-level fluctuations

37
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.740
It is not conducive to His Highness waking up

38
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.020
Do you want to increase the difficulty of the task?

39
00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.500
The next world increases the difficulty of the task

40
00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.480
No matter what

41
00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.260
Your Highness must wake up
