00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:03.340
Mr. Lu, I am very touched.

2
00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:06.980
But I don't deserve you.

3
00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:10.280
Your fans will also disagree with the two of us together.

4
00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:11.660
Don't think so.

5
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.340
We were together for over a year.

6
00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:14.840
I know how good you are.

7
00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:18.840
If you give up being with me because of other people's eyes and opinions

8
00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.880
It's a very sad thing.

9
00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.220
Ying, I love you.

10
00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:25.740
Don't marry him.

11
00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:30.620
I will not allow you to propose to me today.

12
00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:33.280
Serve, you don't rest.

13
00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.100
I've got work tonight.

14
00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:38.560
Sister, you lied to me.

15
00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:40.000
You don't say, wait until after I graduate from college.

16
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.200
When I find a job and settle down, will you agree to date me?

17
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:43.760
Honey, you've got the wrong idea.

18
00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.440
My exact words at the time were if you can study hard.

19
00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:47.560
If you find a good job.

20
00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:49.340
I'll consider dating you.

21
00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:51.200
Do you really not understand my good intentions?

22
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.340
I wanted you to focus on your studies, and you said you'd wait for me.

23
00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:55.440
Want to be my girlfriend

24
00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.260
It means, let go.

25
00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:58.820
Nell, are you okay?

26
00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.860
I'm okay. I know you're not half-hearted.

27
00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:04.660
It's all their wish.

28
00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.900
So, now that you're here today,

29
00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.540
Then be clear.

30
00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:10.400
Don't worry, I'll take care of the back.

31
00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.180
This will not happen in the evening.

32
00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.060
The fool didn't make it clear in this case.
