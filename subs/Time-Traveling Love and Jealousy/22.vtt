00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:00.699
Don't worry.

2
00:00:00.699 --> 00:00:02.633
I'm already tied up

3
00:00:02.633 --> 00:00:04.566
Work as soon as you arrive

4
00:00:04.566 --> 00:00:05.920
Don't go anywhere

5
00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:08.060
Just find someone who doesn't have anyone and do it for her

6
00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:09.266
Why is that?

7
00:00:09.266 --> 00:00:10.000
fool

8
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.600
Someone has found out that your kidnapping will be pursued soon

9
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.080
Find a place to park right now

10
00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.099
In the car. She slashed her face afterwards.

11
00:00:17.099 --> 00:00:18.100
immediately

12
00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:19.120
OK, OK.

13
00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:21.300
You pay, you're the boss.

14
00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.400
I'll find a place for her to do it later

15
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.120
It was Yoyo Mu who talked to the kidnapper on the phone

16
00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:27.266
Sure enough

17
00:00:27.266 --> 00:00:28.000
Xiaoqi

18
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.560
You hacked into the kidnapper's phone

19
00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:32.160
Use his number to send Mu Yoyo real-time positioning

20
00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.440
Make up another message

21
00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:35.760
Say the situation has changed

22
00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.520
Let Mu Yoyo come over immediately

23
00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:39.220
Block Mu Youyou after sending it.

24
00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:41.640
So that she can't call in and confirm with the kidnappers

25
00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:42.740
Good host

26
00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:44.099
Come on.

27
00:00:44.099 --> 00:00:44.933
beauty

28
00:00:44.933 --> 00:00:51.660
Let's find a place to do it later

29
00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.880
There is no heroine in this play tonight, Yoyo Ki

30
00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:57.260
How can that work?
