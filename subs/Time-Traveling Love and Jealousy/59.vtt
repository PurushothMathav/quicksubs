00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:04.020
Son, even if I except to marry my lame sister

2
00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:05.720
We are still Thanh Long Truc Ma.

3
00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:07.660
What about you?

4
00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.860
What can you give him?

5
00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:15.280
If you choose to isolate your sister, you are not qualified to say such words.

6
00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:16.860
I'm lucky I didn't marry you.

7
00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:18.420
Because you don't deserve it.

8
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.020
I don't deserve it.

9
00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.200
What place do you find yourself in your married heart?

10
00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.380
You're just a tool for his sisters.

11
00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.660
What He Wants You Can Never Give Him

12
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.100
Grandmother, we will inherit this after we eat.

13
00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:36.660
Why not stay for two more days?

14
00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.740
That's it, our company.

15
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.800
There's a bit of a problem with the process of launching a newly developed game.

16
00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.200
I'd like to get back to work.

17
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.180
Rest assured mother-in-law

18
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.700
I'll come back to visit you often.

19
00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.340
All right.

20
00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:52.400
Is there a serious problem?

21
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.180
It's okay, I can handle it.

22
00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.400
Yeon-yeon, we're here.

23
00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:06.780
What am I here to eat?

24
00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.580
Would you like to meet my best friends?

25
00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:13.020
They're all my business partners.

26
00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.020
What name?
