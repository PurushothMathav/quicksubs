Judge Yeon

2
00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:04.300
How many men have you hanged?

3
00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:06.500
But you shouldn't.

4
00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:09.020
Those are the people around me.

5
00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:10.720
brother

6
00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.300
Now you should see what kind of woman she is.

7
00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:15.900
You're his brother.

8
00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:17.380
Ah.

9
00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:20.820
Be clear.

10
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:22.400
Don't, don't run.

11
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:25.400
Don't.

12
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.900
Thank you for showing me who this woman really is.

13
00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:31.140
Honey, what are you talking about?

14
00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:32.780
We're family.

15
00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:34.980
I don't want someone like that to be my sister-in-law.

16
00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.180
Right?

17
00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.520
Congratulations to the owner on completing the task.

18
00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:43.140
Has completely changed the direction of the aid film.

19
00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:46.180
The Judgement System Of course cannot love Judge Yeon.

20
00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.760
It was not because of Shen Shen Yeon that you planned, your mission was successful.

21
00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:50.980
Why all of a sudden?

22
00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.160
Little That

23
00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:55.140
How long can I stay in this world?

24
00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.500
The server's next storyline has nothing to do with mission progress.

25
00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:00.060
It makes Little Seven unable to control himself.

26
00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:01.840
When you finish your mission, you leave me.

27
00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:03.360
You really have no conscience.

28
00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:05.100
