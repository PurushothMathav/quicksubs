00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:03.620
Oh, I lost again.

2
00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:05.020
Next for you to win.

3
00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:07.220
Okay, let me get another one.

4
00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:11.560
Looks like someone's looking for me.

5
00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:12.940
I'm not going to fight you anymore.

6
00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:16.600
Why are you here?

7
00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:20.860
I heard you called off the wedding because of me.

8
00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:24.460
Going out with a teenage boy. Who told you that?

9
00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:27.100
It doesn't matter who says it.

10
00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.900
I was recently in a nearby town to talk about projects.

11
00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:31.540
It is also convenient to come here.

12
00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.740
You did that to get revenge on me?

13
00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:35.780
Why should I take revenge on you?

14
00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.280
Your family gave us the project of Khuc Thi Group.

15
00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.640
Give me the freedom to pursue a new boyfriend.

16
00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.000
I should thank you.

17
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.540
Chasing a new boyfriend

18
00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.120
Sister, you mean nothing by such angry words.

19
00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.480
I checked the hotel's open history down the mountain.

20
00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.000
You were in the same room last night.

21
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.500
How old are they?

22
00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.000
You're six years apart.

23
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.600
Do you know the outcome of this?

24
00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.380
Then tell me what the consequences are. I have checked.

25
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.760
He is the only son of the Ta family.

26
00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:08.000
If Ta's family knew that you did this to their only son

27
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.820
You think they'll forgive you, not you.

28
00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.560
The 19-year-old is an adult.

29
00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.280
Even if I slept with him.

30
00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.780
It's also between two adults.

31
00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:20.980
What to do?

32
00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.340
You're not going to work.

33
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.160
Don't leave yourself.

34
00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:27.120
I know we don't have destiny.

35
00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.220
But I'm doing this for your own benefit.

36
00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.020
Go away.
