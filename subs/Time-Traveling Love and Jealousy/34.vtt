1
00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:11.640
No.

2
00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:12.580
Not now.

3
00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:15.200
Men who can easily get it will not appreciate it anymore.

4
00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:16.980
I want you to be patient for a few more days.

5
00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:20.620
Not all men are the same.

6
00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:23.660
Get a divorce tomorrow.

7
00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.540
Didn't you say you didn't care if I got divorced or not?

8
00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:29.820
Listen to me.

9
00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:33.480
Okay, so if you want me to get a divorce...

10
00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.620
Then you have to promise me two conditions.

11
00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:38.040
Tell me.

12
00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.720
First, you have to treat me unconditionally.

13
00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:43.620
Let me bully you.

14
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:45.540
What about Monday?

15
00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:49.720
Second, we just love each other, not get married.

16
00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:53.540
Until one party is fed up with liking the other or dead.

17
00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.780
Same with this first one.

18
00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:02.780
The second reason is because

19
00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:07.460
Because I can't stay here with you until I'm old.

20
00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.160
Because I've been through a failed marriage.

21
00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.100
I don't want to make that mistake again.

22
00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:15.060
Okay, I promise.

23
00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:16.420
Just love.

24
00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.260
Not married.

25
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.940
So we had an agreement to start dating officially.

26
00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:25.260
Call my name

27
00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.260
Has anyone ever called you Ben?

28
00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:30.360
Yen Yen

29
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.680
Darling, you're so disgusting, I'll regret it.

30
00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:35.820
His name is A Yen.

31
00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.980
But you have to call me baby

32
00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:40.440
No.

33
00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:43.520
Then I regret it too.

34
00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.000
My dad said he wanted to get to know me again.

35
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.060
Maybe if I stay with him for a while, I'll see he's a good Autobot.

36
00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:57.800
Come back.

37
00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.880
What?

38
00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:12.460
You're mine.

39
00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:17.240
Forget it.

40
00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.700
Today I will forgive you first.

41
00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:21.500
Sooner or later there will be a day.

42
00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:23.140
Call me baby.
