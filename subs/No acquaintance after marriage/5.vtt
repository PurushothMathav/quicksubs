00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:01.700
Mr. Gu

2
00:00:02.266 --> 00:00:04.033
When I got to his house, I lived on the 11th floor

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.666
Go back and ask your lawyer to get a divorce agreement

4
00:00:10.666 --> 00:00:11.866
Half of the property

5
00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:17.900
Give me the review cooperation plan you wrote

6
00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:19.100
In broad daylight

7
00:00:19.133 --> 00:00:20.366
You didn't wake up?

8
00:00:20.566 --> 00:00:22.566
You're too busy leaving your job

9
00:00:22.566 --> 00:00:24.966
There is no time to hand over these.

10
00:00:25.166 --> 00:00:27.633
Why don't you give him to me?

11
00:00:27.666 --> 00:00:31.833
After all, it is also somewhat related to censorship

12
00:00:31.866 --> 00:00:34.366
I have a higher chance of success.

13
00:00:34.766 --> 00:00:36.133
Hey, what are you doing?

14
00:00:36.133 --> 00:00:38.800
Button will discuss cooperation with Shen's later.

15
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:39.733
Take me with you

16
00:00:39.733 --> 00:00:40.566
What mess

17
00:00:40.566 --> 00:00:41.800
I want a professional secretary

18
00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.166
Here's my proposal.

19
00:00:43.466 --> 00:00:46.666
Mr. Gu, please believe that I am a professional

20
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:50.600
keep up

21
00:00:56.133 --> 00:00:56.866
Lucien?

22
00:00:56.866 --> 00:00:58.966
Did you give Shen Pinting the Shen plan book?

23
00:00:58.966 --> 00:01:00.166
Yeah. Why?

24
00:01:00.166 --> 00:01:01.766
He went to discuss cooperation with Mr. Gu

25
00:01:01.766 --> 00:01:03.066
Turns out to know nothing

26
00:01:03.066 --> 00:01:04.133
So I had a big project.

27
00:01:04.133 --> 00:01:06.666
Mrs. Shen felt that Mr. Gu was deliberately teasing him

28
00:01:06.666 --> 00:01:07.800
Then I want compensation.

29
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.066
I'll be right there.

30
00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.200
Why did you just come?

31
00:01:14.333 --> 00:01:16.666
Your own business is not a fortress for me

32
00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.166
Do you want to kill Mr. Gu?

33
00:01:18.166 --> 00:01:20.900
Kill me, kill the company, shut up

34
00:01:23.066 --> 00:01:24.466
This is what you did.

35
00:01:24.466 --> 00:01:28.100
Sorry, it seems that the internal management of the company is confused.

36
00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.166
I think the cooperation is terminated here

37
00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.033
But Mr. Gu

38
00:01:32.466 --> 00:01:34.566
Liquidated damages, you have to call me a lot

39
00:01:34.566 --> 00:01:36.866
Mr. Gu, this is 100 million

40
00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:38.566
Dare to let the dew pay
