00:00:00.966 --> 00:00:03.266
Mr. Guo, the two have checked it out

2
00:00:03.266 --> 00:00:04.966
It belongs to Shen Pinting

3
00:00:05.933 --> 00:00:07.866
Shen Pinting was in Gemdale yesterday

4
00:00:07.866 --> 00:00:09.266
When Luce bought clothes for the old lady

5
00:00:09.266 --> 00:00:10.200
Met Shen Pinting

6
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.700
He also took a fancy to that dress

7
00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:12.966
relentless

8
00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:15.866
Also slandered Luce for stealing your black and gold dragon card

9
00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:17.933
I slapped him so angrily

10
00:00:17.933 --> 00:00:19.900
Shen Pinting probably counted him because of this

11
00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:21.266
So I found those two people

12
00:00:22.366 --> 00:00:24.500
You said yesterday, right?

13
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:25.666
I checked the surveillance

14
00:00:25.666 --> 00:00:27.266
It's Shen Pinting who is looking for trouble

15
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.233
He also bullied Lu Si together with the shopping guide.

16
00:00:29.533 --> 00:00:31.966
Finally, the manager arrived.

17
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.433
How can Lucy be so kind?

18
00:00:34.466 --> 00:00:35.900
Don't complain when this happens

19
00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:37.966
Yesterday I asked him how his family's financial situation was

20
00:00:37.966 --> 00:00:39.400
He didn't say a word.

21
00:00:39.966 --> 00:00:42.266
Notify the personnel department to fire Shen Pingtian

22
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:43.200
Yes

23
00:00:44.066 --> 00:00:45.700
How dare you come?

24
00:00:46.533 --> 00:00:48.633
Why can't I come?

25
00:00:49.933 --> 00:00:50.733
Never mind.

26
00:00:52.666 --> 00:00:55.100
Why are you in such a hurry to leave?

27
00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.066
I want to call those two gangsters

28
00:00:57.066 --> 00:00:59.966
How do you know it wasn't you who said it?

29
00:00:59.966 --> 00:01:00.766
I don't understand.

30
00:01:00.766 --> 00:01:03.833
Stop pretending, you think I don't know it's you who did it

31
00:01:04.066 --> 00:01:06.900
I don't know what you mean.

32
00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:09.766
If you dare to mess with me again

33
00:01:09.766 --> 00:01:10.933
Be careful I'll ruin you

34
00:01:10.933 --> 00:01:12.866
Bitch I killed you
