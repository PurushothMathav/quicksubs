00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.166
You let go. You let go.

2
00:00:03.066 --> 00:00:04.000
let go

3
00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:10.266
Apologize to him.

4
00:00:10.266 --> 00:00:13.500
I apologize, are you just protecting him like that?

5
00:00:15.533 --> 00:00:16.333
Oh.

6
00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:19.033
He must have seduced you, right?

7
00:00:19.133 --> 00:00:19.966
Smelly no

8
00:00:20.966 --> 00:00:22.300
If you dare to bite again

9
00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:23.500
Believe it or not I will report you for slander

10
00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.500
Just let him bully me like this

11
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:26.300
Tarugawa

12
00:00:27.333 --> 00:00:28.300
Tarugawa

13
00:00:29.066 --> 00:00:31.866
Mr. Gu has the same name as my cheap husband

14
00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:33.966
There is a problem.

15
00:00:35.466 --> 00:00:37.966
Mr. Gu's name is too nice

16
00:00:37.966 --> 00:00:39.966
You dare to tease him in front of me

17
00:00:40.266 --> 00:00:42.100
Isn't it just stripping naked in private?

18
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.100
Your hickeys

19
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.033
Could it be that he was hooked and left behind?

20
00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:48.566
It hurts.

21
00:00:51.966 --> 00:00:53.500
I'll take you back to change your clothes

22
00:00:53.733 --> 00:00:55.300
No need, Mr. Gu

23
00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.066
How do you get back like this?

24
00:00:57.733 --> 00:00:58.866
Thank you Mr. Gu

25
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:07.800
Where to live

26
00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:09.166
I live

27
00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.266
Mr. Gu, I'm sorry, there is a wild cat in front of me

28
00:01:21.266 --> 00:01:22.266
Are you all right?

29
00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:23.866
Watch your eyes.

30
00:01:24.866 --> 00:01:26.766
And I didn't expect

31
00:01:27.266 --> 00:01:28.200
Does it hurt?

32
00:01:29.133 --> 00:01:29.933
Mr. Gu

33
00:01:30.366 --> 00:01:31.366
Excuse me.

34
00:01:31.366 --> 00:01:32.800
Let me take this.

35
00:01:33.866 --> 00:01:37.266
Hey come back I have something to tell you

36
00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:39.700
Mr. Gu

37
00:01:39.866 --> 00:01:42.600
Please stop at the intersection ahead and help me get off

38
00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:43.400
OK

39
00:01:46.166 --> 00:01:48.500
Mom, how do you dress like a man?

40
00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.233
My clothes got dirty and I borrowed a colleague's

41
00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:54.400
Brother, please help me get a dress. What can I get?

42
00:01:54.666 --> 00:01:55.866
Stay away from your brother

43
00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:57.966
I asked you why Zhao Tingchuan didn't come

44
00:01:57.966 --> 00:02:00.100
I'm going to divorce him. What?

45
00:02:00.566 --> 00:02:02.066
You lived three years in vain

46
00:02:02.066 --> 00:02:04.466
The widow dumped you as soon as he came back

47
00:02:04.733 --> 00:02:06.166
Something that doesn't live up to expectations

48
00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.500
I mentioned it, your brain is flooded

49
00:02:10.566 --> 00:02:12.866
That's the rich Zhao family

50
00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.133
That won't work, you hurry up and call him

51
00:02:15.133 --> 00:02:17.600
You have to let him give half of the estate to your mother

52
00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.400
I don't fight

53
00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:20.666
What are you talking about?

54
00:02:25.333 --> 00:02:26.133
yunyao
