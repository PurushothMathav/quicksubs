00:00:04.533 --> 00:00:05.866
Leave first

2
00:00:06.166 --> 00:00:09.300
But why does Zhao Tingchuan's handwriting look familiar?

3
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.433
I seem to be somewhere

4
00:00:12.333 --> 00:00:13.400
Are you ready?

5
00:00:13.966 --> 00:00:17.433
Okay, I'll ask the errand to deliver it to you later.

6
00:00:23.466 --> 00:00:25.533
Mr. Gu has checked it out

7
00:00:25.533 --> 00:00:26.933
It's really fake news.

8
00:00:26.933 --> 00:00:29.200
It was jointly reviewed and sent by the Zhao family.

9
00:00:29.566 --> 00:00:30.366
Zhao family

10
00:00:30.766 --> 00:00:32.366
I'll go back home for a few more days.

11
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:33.666
They can't take it anymore

12
00:00:33.666 --> 00:00:35.666
You took your surname and broke away from the Zhao family

13
00:00:35.666 --> 00:00:37.800
How can they bear it when their hearts are so high?

14
00:00:39.166 --> 00:00:40.700
I can't stand it

15
00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.900
Mr. Gu, do you mean to attack them?

16
00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:46.866
The day after tomorrow is my mother's birthday.

17
00:00:47.066 --> 00:00:49.766
It's not the right time to tear your face with them

18
00:00:49.766 --> 00:00:52.000
Wait a minute, is this the case?

19
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.033
Immediately terminate the cooperation with the review is

20
00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.433
You are also very clear about the methods of the Zhao family

21
00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.166
If it weren't for a long-winded reminder this time

22
00:01:00.166 --> 00:01:01.766
Maybe we're really going to break up

23
00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.833
He's quite loyal

24
00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:07.633
You can decide how much to say

25
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:13.466
Hello, Mom.

26
00:01:15.133 --> 00:01:15.933
hear through

27
00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:20.233
Is that a birthday present for mom on your desk?

28
00:01:20.466 --> 00:01:23.366
That's right, this dress is so pretty.

29
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.633
Dignified, generous and fit

30
00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.200
My birthday dinner the day after tomorrow

31
00:01:28.533 --> 00:01:30.300
I'm dressed just right

32
00:01:30.333 --> 00:01:33.300
Look at the past few years of going abroad

33
00:01:33.566 --> 00:01:36.000
You have a better eye for clothes.

34
00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.100
It's better if you pick women

35
00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.000
That would be even better.
