00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:03.566
Mr. Gu, what happened today is my dereliction of duty.

2
00:00:03.566 --> 00:00:04.366
I'm so sorry.

3
00:00:04.366 --> 00:00:06.533
The project under review will be your responsibility later.

4
00:00:06.533 --> 00:00:08.100
But I have already submitted my resignation application.

5
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:11.400
I'm afraid I can't be responsible for the follow-up. I refused.

6
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:13.433
Secretary

7
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.966
It's up to you in the future, hey

8
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.500
Just say the divorce agreement from lawyer Xu

9
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.400
Hello, when will you sign?

10
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:28.566
divorce

11
00:00:28.566 --> 00:00:31.300
Wouldn't it be that the one-night stand with me was discovered?

12
00:00:37.333 --> 00:00:40.600
So coincidentally, I just heard Mr. Gu say the divorce agreement

13
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.433
Zhao Tingchuan contacted me

14
00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.066
I don't know, I thought they were alone

15
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.500
When will you sign it?

16
00:00:52.666 --> 00:00:56.233
This seems to be a coincidence of Mr. Gu's personal mobile phone

17
00:01:00.366 --> 00:01:01.166
OK

18
00:01:02.333 --> 00:01:04.100
It can't be that coincidental

19
00:01:07.133 --> 00:01:10.366
Hey grandpa, do you still have my grandpa in your eyes?

20
00:01:10.366 --> 00:01:11.500
I heard you are getting a divorce.

21
00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:12.700
Yunyang is such a girl

22
00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:14.200
Why don't you know how to cherish it?

23
00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.266
He proposed

24
00:01:15.266 --> 00:01:17.866
I respect him, it's okay if you don't show up after receiving the certificate

25
00:01:17.866 --> 00:01:19.466
I haven't returned to China once in recent years

26
00:01:19.466 --> 00:01:22.200
People have been waiting for you for three years without complaint

27
00:01:22.333 --> 00:01:23.866
Now you talk about respect

28
00:01:23.966 --> 00:01:25.400
That would be irresponsible.

29
00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.933
If you're a man, you should die looking for him

30
00:01:27.933 --> 00:01:29.500
He's definitely not leaving

31
00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.300
Ogawa, just listen to what you say and do

32
00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:33.400
I'll think about it.
