00:00:02.766 --> 00:00:06.633
No, it's too late for you to say no now

2
00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.900
What's the purpose, you rascal?

3
00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:30.866
Let go of me

4
00:00:31.066 --> 00:00:33.166
Pack it for me now I don't have it

5
00:00:37.933 --> 00:00:38.966
Your husband?

6
00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.200
I'd like to see how this scene ends

7
00:00:45.566 --> 00:00:47.966
How was the handsome guy last night?

8
00:00:47.966 --> 00:00:49.700
I saw him drink with my own eyes

9
00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.000
701288 The medicine you prescribed

10
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.900
Yes, my brother-in-law got the certificate and went abroad

11
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:55.966
It takes three years to run

12
00:00:55.966 --> 00:00:57.166
Said it was busy

13
00:00:57.166 --> 00:00:59.033
Who knows if they are raising children outside?

14
00:00:59.333 --> 00:01:01.300
You can't just stay widowed.

15
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.500
That man last night was a masterpiece

16
00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:04.800
Break anything for you

17
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.633
I did it for your own good.

18
00:01:07.133 --> 00:01:09.200
I'm sorry about last night

19
00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:10.866
No matter what, you will not suffer.

20
00:01:11.733 --> 00:01:12.800
Out this door

21
00:01:12.966 --> 00:01:14.433
We don't know anybody.

22
00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:15.633
And so forth.

23
00:01:16.366 --> 00:01:17.866
Take this pill

24
00:01:31.266 --> 00:01:34.166
Mom's divorce agreement, I've done it for you

25
00:01:34.166 --> 00:01:35.833
I'll ask you to come and sign today
