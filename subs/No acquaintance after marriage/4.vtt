00:00:00.666 --> 00:00:01.466
Manager Liu

2
00:00:04.066 --> 00:00:06.333
No, you have been since the company was founded

3
00:00:06.333 --> 00:00:07.733
Most familiar with the company's business

4
00:00:07.733 --> 00:00:09.366
Mr. Gu just took over

5
00:00:09.466 --> 00:00:11.166
I need you anytime

6
00:00:11.266 --> 00:00:13.633
Is it Mr. Gu's intention?

7
00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:17.500
All right

8
00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:21.666
Recruiting and docking work take a certain amount of time

9
00:00:22.166 --> 00:00:24.966
Well, you can leave in a month.

10
00:00:26.533 --> 00:00:27.333
Oh.

11
00:00:30.966 --> 00:00:32.166
Why aren't you leaving?

12
00:00:33.466 --> 00:00:36.600
There's still some work at the junction and I need to stay for another month

13
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:37.366
Really?

14
00:00:37.366 --> 00:00:40.433
If you don't believe me, ask Manager Liu, don't shake in front of me

15
00:00:40.866 --> 00:00:41.766
Yes

16
00:00:42.533 --> 00:00:44.033
You think I'm rare

17
00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:47.200
Mr. Gu

18
00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.966
This is the gift you told me to prepare for my wife

19
00:00:50.366 --> 00:00:52.300
Where does he live? Riverside Gardens

20
00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:53.766
I'll take you there.

21
00:00:56.733 --> 00:00:57.533
Mom

22
00:00:58.133 --> 00:00:59.800
Zhao Tingchuan is back

23
00:01:00.266 --> 00:01:01.600
I don't know.

24
00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.100
What do you know?

25
00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.700
It's been three years. You haven't seen each other

26
00:01:05.933 --> 00:01:07.400
The Zhao family is so rich

27
00:01:07.566 --> 00:01:09.366
You haven't got a penny yet.

28
00:01:09.366 --> 00:01:10.666
You loser

29
00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.066
I'll give you three days.

30
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.800
Or take him home

31
00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.266
Or divorce him

32
00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:16.766
Let Xuewei marry

33
00:01:16.933 --> 00:01:17.900
What about Xuewei?

34
00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:19.666
More than you will come

35
00:01:19.666 --> 00:01:21.000
Did you hear what I said?

36
00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:24.766
If it hadn't happened last night

37
00:01:24.766 --> 00:01:26.900
I will try to get along well with him.

38
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.700
But now I'm not good enough for him

39
00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.366
I heard you're back

40
00:01:31.366 --> 00:01:32.866
Let's get a divorce.
