00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:05.700
Mom

2
00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:08.766
What are you doing? If you give me money obediently

3
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.566
Should I treat you like this?

4
00:00:10.566 --> 00:00:12.433
I said I have no money

5
00:00:12.566 --> 00:00:15.500
Sister, how can you lie?

6
00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.633
I can listen to Zhao Tingchuan with my own ears

7
00:00:17.666 --> 00:00:19.466
He took half of your fortune

8
00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:21.600
Even if fixed assets are not available

9
00:00:21.933 --> 00:00:24.766
That should be a lot of cash, right?

10
00:00:24.966 --> 00:00:28.000
Wake up. You made Mom do this

11
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:28.900
Are you crazy?

12
00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:30.400
Why do you talk like that?

13
00:00:30.566 --> 00:00:32.433
We are family

14
00:00:32.666 --> 00:00:35.833
Isn't it right to give some money?

15
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:38.200
Nope.

16
00:00:38.733 --> 00:00:40.066
So heartless

17
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.166
Ah, I heard you seem to be pregnant.

18
00:00:46.333 --> 00:00:50.633
Then what do you think will happen if I go down with this knife?

19
00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:52.533
What do you mean?

20
00:00:52.533 --> 00:00:53.666
Why are you still holding a knife?

21
00:00:53.666 --> 00:00:55.766
It doesn't mean just tie up the money he took

22
00:00:55.766 --> 00:00:56.566
Mom

23
00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:58.866
Do you still want to save the company?

24
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.833
Do you want to make Dad's efforts stronger and bigger?

25
00:01:02.066 --> 00:01:04.566
Do you still want to live a superior life?

26
00:01:12.066 --> 00:01:14.433
Sister, I have the final say here

27
00:01:14.533 --> 00:01:16.033
I'll give you one more chance.

28
00:01:16.333 --> 00:01:18.800
Are you giving or not?

29
00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.000
On the divorce agreement

30
00:01:23.133 --> 00:01:25.266
It's really half of the property I can get

31
00:01:25.266 --> 00:01:26.800
But the money hasn't come yet.

32
00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.833
You don't know what's going on.

33
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.200
Did you forget him?

34
00:01:38.266 --> 00:01:40.900
The property that Gu Tingchuan said at the beginning

35
00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:42.300
When do you work part-time?
