00:00:05.133 --> 00:00:05.933
Ah!

2
00:00:06.933 --> 00:00:08.766
I didn't expect you to do this

3
00:00:09.166 --> 00:00:11.466
Then shut up

4
00:00:14.766 --> 00:00:17.433
I'll have a lawyer talk to you about the divorce

5
00:00:20.333 --> 00:00:22.200
Even a stunner like me dares to refuse

6
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:23.500
Still a man?

7
00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:26.000
It's 7:20, go back now

8
00:00:26.466 --> 00:00:27.666
Calculate time

9
00:00:27.666 --> 00:00:29.900
They are hot right now

10
00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:30.866
I have something to buy

11
00:00:30.866 --> 00:00:32.166
What's in such a hurry?

12
00:00:32.166 --> 00:00:33.900
How inappropriate to keep people waiting?

13
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:35.166
Isn't that still an acupuncture point?

14
00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:38.100
Yun Xuewei is at home

15
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.100
Didn't you promise me she wouldn't be here tonight?

16
00:00:42.966 --> 00:00:46.200
You lied to me, so you left me on purpose just now.

17
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.033
Just to leave the two of them alone

18
00:00:48.366 --> 00:00:50.800
Mom, Zhao Tingchuan and I haven't divorced yet

19
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.000
Why are you screaming so loudly?

20
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:52.900
Don't be ashamed

21
00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:54.566
You know shame

22
00:00:54.766 --> 00:00:55.600
You know, embarrassing.

23
00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.766
He also let his sister-in-law and brother-in-law stay together

24
00:00:57.766 --> 00:00:59.166
How can I be a person if it gets out?

25
00:00:59.166 --> 00:01:00.733
You don't even consider Zhao Tingshan's reputation

26
00:01:00.733 --> 00:01:04.000
Do you think the Zhao family knows that he can enter?

27
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.633
Why does that person look a bit like Mr. Ku?
