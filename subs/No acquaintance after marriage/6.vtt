1
00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:01.566
That's a billion dollars.

2
00:00:01.566 --> 00:00:02.900
Dare to let the dew pay

3
00:00:06.166 --> 00:00:08.566
Mr. Shen, this is 100 million

4
00:00:08.566 --> 00:00:11.400
Take it well, what do you mean?

5
00:00:17.066 --> 00:00:17.866
Mr. Shen

6
00:00:18.566 --> 00:00:20.966
Once this cooperation plan is implemented

7
00:00:20.966 --> 00:00:23.300
It will bring to the scrutiny of far more than 100 million

8
00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.266
Are you sure you want to lose the big because of the small?

9
00:00:26.066 --> 00:00:27.166
Not very old.

10
00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.400
That's nice.

11
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:29.666
Give me half an hour.

12
00:00:29.666 --> 00:00:31.000
Let me enjoy it for you

13
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.600
It's not too late for you to decide then, is it?

14
00:00:35.766 --> 00:00:37.800
Sure. Half an hour.

15
00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:45.600
It's been an hour and it hasn't come out yet

16
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.433
It doesn't seem to be capable

17
00:00:47.533 --> 00:00:50.000
I'm afraid it's not sad-fishing begging for mercy

18
00:00:52.966 --> 00:00:55.900
Lu Zi, I didn't expect that you are not only strong in business ability

19
00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:56.866
Better personality

20
00:00:56.866 --> 00:00:59.133
Mr. Gu, your secretary is not simple

21
00:00:59.133 --> 00:01:00.833
Why don't you give him to me?

22
00:01:01.266 --> 00:01:02.266
Mr. Shen joked

23
00:01:02.266 --> 00:01:03.666
Lost is not an item after all

24
00:01:03.666 --> 00:01:05.633
He has the right to choose where he goes

25
00:01:05.666 --> 00:01:06.833
Xie Shen Station

26
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.500
But I came to the story as soon as I graduated

27
00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:09.300
These years

28
00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.600
I have already made the story my home

29
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.066
Then I won't force it

30
00:01:13.066 --> 00:01:15.200
However, the follow-up docking of this project

31
00:01:15.333 --> 00:01:16.666
But you're in charge.

32
00:01:17.466 --> 00:01:18.600
Hey, Mr. Shen

33
00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.966
Mr. Gu Lu sir stop

34
00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.866
Dad, why did you suddenly agree to cooperate?

35
00:01:27.866 --> 00:01:29.300
He really convinced you.

36
00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:31.500
Yeah. How is that possible?

37
00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:32.800
He's better than you

38
00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:33.666
According to his plan

39
00:01:33.666 --> 00:01:36.200
Can bring 1 billion or even tens of billions in return

40
00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.466
Of course I'd love to.

41
00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:39.500
But you obviously let me

42
00:01:40.733 --> 00:01:42.000
Keep your mouth shut

43
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.566
I let you into the story

44
00:01:43.566 --> 00:01:45.666
It's to get you close to Gu Tingchuan

45
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.900
But now they don't even know who you are

46
00:01:49.133 --> 00:01:50.000
rubbish

47
00:01:53.133 --> 00:01:54.500
This bitch

48
00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:57.300
So humiliating I killed you
