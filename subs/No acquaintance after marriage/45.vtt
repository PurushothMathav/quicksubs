00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:01.333
Welcome.

2
00:00:01.333 --> 00:00:03.166
2 What do you need to buy?

3
00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:04.833
Buy a set of jewelry.

4
00:00:05.133 --> 00:00:06.600
Wedding hardware, right?

5
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.133
You are a newly married couple, aren't you?

6
00:00:08.133 --> 00:00:09.566
No wonder they look so noble

7
00:00:09.566 --> 00:00:10.766
You misunderstood.

8
00:00:10.933 --> 00:00:13.200
Let's not waste time.

9
00:00:13.933 --> 00:00:15.566
Sir, at a glance, it is a day and a thousand gold

10
00:00:15.566 --> 00:00:16.933
Make millions in minutes

11
00:00:16.933 --> 00:00:18.866
Now take time to accompany your wife to do shopping

12
00:00:18.866 --> 00:00:20.033
You really love him

13
00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:21.600
Please hurry up.

14
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.000
Okay, you two, please follow me here

15
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.066
All our wedding hardware is here

16
00:00:26.566 --> 00:00:28.500
We're not looking for wedding hardware.

17
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.966
Just buy a full set of jewelry.

18
00:00:30.966 --> 00:00:32.466
What is your budget?

19
00:00:32.566 --> 00:00:33.666
You can choose

20
00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.566
I'm not suitable

21
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.233
I don't understand your women's preferences

22
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:43.600
Well, that's really what a secretary should do

23
00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.866
But why do I feel a little uncomfortable?

24
00:00:45.866 --> 00:00:47.166
How nice is your husband to you?

25
00:00:47.166 --> 00:00:49.766
You are still sorry, you are about to open your choice

26
00:00:56.266 --> 00:00:57.300
This one.

27
00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.200
Is this the one you like?

28
00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.266
I'll take it out for you right now. No need.

29
00:01:10.533 --> 00:01:13.700
Just him, young and fashionable without losing his elegance. Wow.

30
00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.166
Madam, you have a good eye.

31
00:01:15.166 --> 00:01:16.933
This is our town store model.

32
00:01:16.933 --> 00:01:18.300
One set nationwide

33
00:01:18.333 --> 00:01:20.233
It's a little expensive.

34
00:01:20.733 --> 00:01:23.266
Mr. Wrap it up is really a pet

35
00:01:23.266 --> 00:01:25.433
50 million and you don't even blink an eye

36
00:01:25.766 --> 00:01:27.500
Please hurry up.
