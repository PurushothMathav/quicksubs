00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:02.766
Don't let him go to the pregnant woman and wait for my news

2
00:00:02.966 --> 00:00:04.600
You're not getting a divorce?

3
00:00:05.066 --> 00:00:06.433
I'll go talk to him first

4
00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:08.000
talk

5
00:00:08.933 --> 00:00:10.366
Are you still planning to get a divorce?

6
00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:12.233
But I feel ashamed of him

7
00:00:12.366 --> 00:00:14.766
So I'm going to meet and ask in person

8
00:00:14.766 --> 00:00:17.033
I know. What about Lucy?

9
00:00:17.966 --> 00:00:19.200
What's wrong with him?

10
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.700
He is also married

11
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:23.566
And he feels that he has a good relationship with his husband

12
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:24.866
It's a big illusion.

13
00:00:25.366 --> 00:00:26.700
I'll solve my problem first.

14
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:28.566
So when do you plan to see Yunyao?

15
00:00:28.566 --> 00:00:29.900
I'll make an appointment for you.

16
00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.766
Don't you need the gift you bought last time?

17
00:00:32.766 --> 00:00:33.966
You threw it away.

18
00:00:33.966 --> 00:00:35.366
I'll go and pick out another one for you.

19
00:00:35.966 --> 00:00:37.700
No need, I'll buy it myself.

20
00:00:39.933 --> 00:00:40.900
Come out with me.

21
00:00:42.266 --> 00:00:43.066
Ah!

22
00:00:51.466 --> 00:00:53.600
Mr. Shen, you are wronged.

23
00:00:53.666 --> 00:00:55.366
It's my fault too

24
00:00:55.866 --> 00:00:57.166
Blame me

25
00:00:57.533 --> 00:00:58.366
Who can know

26
00:00:58.366 --> 00:01:00.533
He turned against you for a woman

27
00:01:00.533 --> 00:01:02.400
Don't they all say that he only sees work?

28
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:03.666
I don't think so either.

29
00:01:03.666 --> 00:01:04.466
Hehe

30
00:01:05.366 --> 00:01:07.066
It's a lover

31
00:01:07.066 --> 00:01:09.200
Then can this woman take advantage of it?

32
00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.066
use

33
00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.400
I just saved my business with my old face

34
00:01:14.666 --> 00:01:17.200
Absolutely no more forks

35
00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.100
Let him be proud for a while

36
00:01:21.366 --> 00:01:22.666
My cooperation is complete.

37
00:01:22.666 --> 00:01:24.400
See how I treat him

38
00:01:26.866 --> 00:01:29.966
Mr. Gu, you have no plans to travel today

39
00:01:29.966 --> 00:01:31.266
Temporary change

40
00:01:31.266 --> 00:01:32.566
Is something wrong?

41
00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.200
What do you women like?

42
00:01:38.566 --> 00:01:39.866
Do you want to give a gift?

43
00:01:39.866 --> 00:01:41.100
How old is the other party?

44
00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:42.800
I'm pissed.

45
00:01:43.366 --> 00:01:44.166
that

46
00:01:45.466 --> 00:01:46.566
Give jewelry

47
00:01:46.666 --> 00:01:49.366
Women love and deserve his status

48
00:01:49.666 --> 00:01:51.400
Last I heard he was divorced

49
00:01:51.466 --> 00:01:53.533
Now it's time to pick the gift for him yourself.

50
00:01:53.533 --> 00:01:54.900
It seems they are reconciled

51
00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.266
That's the only thing he cares about. He should like him very much, right?

52
00:01:57.266 --> 00:01:58.066
mainland

53
00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:59.500
Yes
