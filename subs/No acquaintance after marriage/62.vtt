00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:01.600
Mr. Gu is going to the construction site market

2
00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:03.500
You can come with me. Okay.

3
00:00:09.766 --> 00:00:11.966
The developer of this building went bankrupt

4
00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:15.233
Unfinished buildings like this usually don't get picked up.

5
00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.333
But get the latest news

6
00:00:17.333 --> 00:00:19.100
It looks like a school district is going to be developed around here

7
00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:21.400
In this way, his room for improvement will be greater

8
00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:22.900
Exactly.

9
00:00:22.933 --> 00:00:25.566
He's a big hit at tonight's auction

10
00:00:25.566 --> 00:00:27.066
All the bosses are watching

11
00:00:27.166 --> 00:00:28.800
If you want to shoot

12
00:00:29.166 --> 00:00:31.300
Lucy and I need to do some preparation in advance

13
00:00:31.666 --> 00:00:33.566
Don't worry, turn around first

14
00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.666
Find a place to eat around here at noon

15
00:00:35.666 --> 00:00:37.333
By the way, let me know the situation.

16
00:00:37.333 --> 00:00:38.600
What do you mean?

17
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.066
I am afraid that the news of the key primary school is false

18
00:00:41.266 --> 00:00:43.900
Usually people don't know about this kind of thing

19
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.566
It's always right to ask more

20
00:00:46.566 --> 00:00:49.600
Mr. Gu, I appreciate your doing this.

21
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:50.666
Hold your breath

22
00:00:56.866 --> 00:00:58.800
Ms. Yun, why did you break your promise?

23
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.366
If you don't want a divorce, just say it

24
00:01:00.366 --> 00:01:02.066
No no no I want to leave

25
00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.266
The sooner the better.

26
00:01:03.366 --> 00:01:06.766
So you run that divorce settlement errand to my house

27
00:01:06.766 --> 00:01:08.666
I'll go back and sign when I'm done.

28
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.500
I will stubbornly believe you again
