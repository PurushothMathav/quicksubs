00:00:01.266 --> 00:00:03.000
Lucy Gu

2
00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:06.400
Are you coming to the dinner party too?

3
00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:07.200
Right

4
00:00:07.733 --> 00:00:09.900
Ah, it didn't hurt you just now, did it?

5
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.200
No, why are you alone?

6
00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.533
What about your husband?

7
00:00:14.533 --> 00:00:15.333
Who?

8
00:00:15.866 --> 00:00:16.666
Lucerne

9
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:18.633
You are here too

10
00:00:19.466 --> 00:00:20.266
Duan Tezhuo

11
00:00:21.066 --> 00:00:23.400
It's hard for the old lady to go over and let you announce the opening

12
00:00:25.666 --> 00:00:28.400
Then Mr. Gu, please be busy first.

13
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.033
sister

14
00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.000
If you are here, then you can accompany my brother in.

15
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:37.933
I'll go first

16
00:00:37.933 --> 00:00:39.566
Then I'll take you out.

17
00:00:39.566 --> 00:00:40.566
It's about to start.

18
00:00:40.566 --> 00:00:41.666
Come on in.

19
00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:44.766
Sister, I have something to tell you, wait a minute.

20
00:00:44.766 --> 00:00:46.766
I want to see what Zhao Tingchuan looks like

21
00:00:46.766 --> 00:00:48.866
Sister, I have something to tell you.

22
00:00:48.866 --> 00:00:51.033
What's there to see in that revival talk?

23
00:00:51.733 --> 00:00:52.866
Say do you need it?

24
00:00:52.866 --> 00:00:53.766
What do you mean?

25
00:00:53.966 --> 00:00:56.133
Oh, brother, look at your interruption

26
00:00:56.133 --> 00:00:58.166
I forgot what to tell my sister

27
00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.400
Do you just not want me to see Zhang Ding?

28
00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:01.400
What does the river look like?

29
00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:02.766
I don't have it.

30
00:01:02.766 --> 00:01:04.066
I'm doing it for my sister too

31
00:01:04.066 --> 00:01:06.100
He hasn't come to see you for more than three years

32
00:01:06.266 --> 00:01:08.633
It means that he doesn't have you in his heart at all.

33
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.666
What if you met him?

34
00:01:10.733 --> 00:01:13.766
I'm not asking for trouble, you think I'll believe you
