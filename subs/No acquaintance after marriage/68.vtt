00:00:01.766 --> 00:00:03.066
Lucy is your secretary

2
00:00:03.066 --> 00:00:05.066
You bring the past he also said.

3
00:00:05.166 --> 00:00:07.033
Forget it, no need.

4
00:00:12.366 --> 00:00:16.500
Wei Ye, you must bring Yunyao with you tonight

5
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.266
You are coming to participate

6
00:00:19.066 --> 00:00:20.933
I'm still recuperating abroad

7
00:00:20.933 --> 00:00:22.166
What am I going to do?

8
00:00:22.766 --> 00:00:24.366
Then you should take good care of yourself.

9
00:00:24.366 --> 00:00:26.766
Don't worry about it, you won't agree.

10
00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.400
The wings are really hard

11
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.466
I asked you to change your last name back, but you didn't listen.

12
00:00:30.466 --> 00:00:32.166
Now take your wife with you

13
00:00:32.166 --> 00:00:34.033
I divorced him a long time ago

14
00:00:34.566 --> 00:00:35.666
So far away

15
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.500
How dare you make your own decisions about such a big thing?

16
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.500
Grandpa, that dinner party is about to start

17
00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.100
I'll talk to you next time.

18
00:00:50.666 --> 00:00:51.600
Grandpa

19
00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:54.733
It's really comforting that you are still willing to call me grandpa.

20
00:00:54.733 --> 00:00:57.600
It seems that you all know

21
00:00:57.666 --> 00:00:59.833
So you really left

22
00:01:00.733 --> 00:01:03.266
Well, the agreement has been signed

23
00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.033
I'm sorry, grandpa.

24
00:01:05.166 --> 00:01:07.366
I failed to maintain this marriage

25
00:01:07.533 --> 00:01:08.300
I see.

26
00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:11.066
It was you who saw that I saved you

27
00:01:11.066 --> 00:01:12.866
You just agreed to get married

28
00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.100
But I'm doing it for your own good.

29
00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:16.400
Marry a wife

30
00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:17.766
You're a good girl.

31
00:01:17.766 --> 00:01:21.100
Listen that life will only be better with you by your side

32
00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.900
But why can't you really go back?

33
00:01:24.733 --> 00:01:26.766
Well, not really.

34
00:01:27.133 --> 00:01:28.500
Pardon me?
