00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:01.066
Ah!

2
00:00:02.733 --> 00:00:04.266
Dad trash

3
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.200
I let you into the story

4
00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:08.666
I thought you could handle Gu Tingchuan

5
00:00:08.666 --> 00:00:11.166
And steal the secrets of StoryCorps

6
00:00:11.166 --> 00:00:13.333
You'd better do stupid things

7
00:00:13.333 --> 00:00:15.566
He also got himself into the police station

8
00:00:15.566 --> 00:00:17.466
Blame that bitch

9
00:00:17.466 --> 00:00:19.133
He insisted on robbing me of a man

10
00:00:19.133 --> 00:00:19.933
let go

11
00:00:20.366 --> 00:00:22.366
That's why people are better than you

12
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.100
Who is as stupid as a pig as you

13
00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:26.200
Where does it look like my species?

14
00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.366
You know I tried to get you out

15
00:00:28.366 --> 00:00:29.766
How hard did I try?

16
00:00:30.466 --> 00:00:32.466
If it weren't for the fear of losing face

17
00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.100
I don't care about you.

18
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.066
I won't leave anything next time

19
00:00:37.166 --> 00:00:39.100
I want a next time

20
00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:40.566
Save your head

21
00:00:40.566 --> 00:00:43.433
I have suffered so much because of him

22
00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.666
It was also rejected by the story

23
00:00:45.766 --> 00:00:49.366
Now I can't get close to Gu Tingchuan anymore

24
00:00:49.966 --> 00:00:51.533
Is that it?

25
00:00:51.533 --> 00:00:54.000
So too

26
00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:58.666
I'll do the math for you

27
00:01:04.533 --> 00:01:06.166
Mr. Shen Lu Siya

28
00:01:06.966 --> 00:01:08.700
The collaboration between Shen Shi and the story

29
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.133
I still have a few questions, you say?

30
00:01:11.133 --> 00:01:12.600
I will answer them for you one by one.

31
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.666
I don't like making phone calls

32
00:01:14.666 --> 00:01:16.333
So you can come over now.

33
00:01:16.333 --> 00:01:17.433
Let's talk

34
00:01:18.366 --> 00:01:20.466
What now?

35
00:01:20.466 --> 00:01:22.500
I'd love to.

36
00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:23.366
Of course I would.

37
00:01:23.366 --> 00:01:24.500
I'm coming.

38
00:01:27.466 --> 00:01:28.766
Come quickly

39
00:01:29.333 --> 00:01:32.200
Come here, Mr. Shen, I brought the picture book

40
00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.100
You see sit first

41
00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:38.833
Mr. Shen, look at your right
