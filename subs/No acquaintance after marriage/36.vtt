00:00:01.766 --> 00:00:02.966
Why is it you again?

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.300
I told you he needs a good rest

3
00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:07.366
Besides, he's allergic to alcohol

4
00:00:07.366 --> 00:00:08.733
And you let him drink?

5
00:00:08.733 --> 00:00:09.600
How to be a boyfriend

6
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:11.233
You are allergic

7
00:00:12.066 --> 00:00:14.266
Is it serious? It's alright this time.

8
00:00:14.766 --> 00:00:16.300
But not next time.

9
00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:17.633
It must be taken seriously.

10
00:00:18.066 --> 00:00:19.366
Ok he's alright

11
00:00:19.366 --> 00:00:20.466
Just a moment.

12
00:00:20.466 --> 00:00:22.166
Ok right

13
00:00:22.333 --> 00:00:24.466
Apply the ointment I just gave you to him.

14
00:00:25.133 --> 00:00:26.866
Uh uh okay

15
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.966
Said that Mr. Gu checked it out

16
00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.400
Lucy should have been drunk by Mr. Shen

17
00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.133
Mr. Shen should be trying to help Shen Pinting vent his anger

18
00:00:39.133 --> 00:00:40.666
Shen Pinting is out

19
00:00:42.366 --> 00:00:44.333
Mr. Shen found someone to borrow your mother's name

20
00:00:44.333 --> 00:00:45.300
Pulled him out

21
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.366
As soon as Mr. Shen received him, he called Lucy over

22
00:00:47.366 --> 00:00:49.333
But it seems that only one drink was given to him

23
00:00:49.333 --> 00:00:50.800
Go to your mother's side

24
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.866
It should also be the situation of audit suspension

25
00:00:54.166 --> 00:00:55.366
Oh, I see.

26
00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.300
Why does Mr. Gu have time to call me?

27
00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:08.200
I'll give you one day to send Shen Pinting out

28
00:01:08.533 --> 00:01:10.100
Don't go, this is to kill you

29
00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:11.066
Just a secretary

30
00:01:11.066 --> 00:01:12.933
Are you sure you want to be with me for him?

31
00:01:12.933 --> 00:01:14.366
Don't make me do it myself

32
00:01:14.366 --> 00:01:16.566
Okay, okay, I'll send him abroad right now

33
00:01:16.566 --> 00:01:18.166
He is not allowed to come back in the short term

34
00:01:18.266 --> 00:01:20.300
Mr. Zhu, do you think this is satisfactory?

35
00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:21.666
Collaboration with scrutiny

36
00:01:21.666 --> 00:01:23.166
I'll follow up with someone else.

37
00:01:23.166 --> 00:01:25.200
Mr. Gu is really tight

38
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.533
I've got him anyway

39
00:01:26.533 --> 00:01:28.066
It doesn't matter if he comes again or not.

40
00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.300
Pardon me?
