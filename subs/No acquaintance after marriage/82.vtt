00:00:00.733 --> 00:00:02.633
Ok ok

2
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.300
I raised a good son

3
00:00:07.666 --> 00:00:09.266
Auntie, don't be angry.

4
00:00:09.366 --> 00:00:10.800
I'll take you to the lounge first

5
00:00:13.133 --> 00:00:14.033
aunt

6
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:18.866
Or are you sensible?

7
00:00:19.266 --> 00:00:21.700
You are also wronged today.

8
00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:22.833
It's okay auntie

9
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:26.900
I just don't get it.

10
00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:29.333
What do you think is so good about that little bitch?

11
00:00:29.333 --> 00:00:31.100
Let him make trouble with me again and again

12
00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:33.200
I think I saw him in a bar before

13
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.000
He is with a man

14
00:00:36.333 --> 00:00:38.500
Just make it clear

15
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:39.900
I saw him cuddling with a man

16
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:41.066
Hug and go to open a room

17
00:00:41.066 --> 00:00:42.166
That Man?

18
00:00:42.166 --> 00:00:44.600
He obviously just met at a bar

19
00:00:44.933 --> 00:00:47.100
His one-night stand with a strange man

20
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.600
How dare he cheat and stop the boat?

21
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.766
Auntie, don't be angry

22
00:00:51.866 --> 00:00:53.566
Maybe I read it wrong

23
00:00:54.066 --> 00:00:54.900
You say

24
00:00:55.466 --> 00:00:56.666
Which bar?

25
00:00:56.666 --> 00:00:57.466
When?

26
00:00:57.466 --> 00:01:00.633
It's like June 18th, 1987. Bar

27
00:01:01.933 --> 00:01:04.033
Fortunately, I found someone to wipe the surveillance in advance

28
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:06.033
Lao Wang, please check it for me.

29
00:01:06.366 --> 00:01:10.166
Did Yunyao go to the 1987 bar on June 18?

30
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.566
The old lady was indeed there that night

31
00:01:17.566 --> 00:01:17.966
It's true.

32
00:01:17.966 --> 00:01:19.566
Spent a night in a bar with a guy

33
00:01:19.566 --> 00:01:21.100
However, the surveillance only saw the back of the man

34
00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:21.466
I don't know who it is.

35
00:01:21.466 --> 00:01:22.700
I don't care who he is.

36
00:01:22.933 --> 00:01:24.766
It's a fact that you're going to cheat

37
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.033
King, please help me with something

38
00:01:27.466 --> 00:01:30.066
This time I'm going to beat him to death.
