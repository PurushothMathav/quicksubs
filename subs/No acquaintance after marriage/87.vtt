00:00:04.466 --> 00:00:05.266
Let's go

2
00:00:06.766 --> 00:00:08.100
Mr. Gu, you and Rosen

3
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:09.666
You said yesterday not to disturb him

4
00:00:09.666 --> 00:00:11.666
Why are you two having a baby today? Shh.

5
00:00:11.966 --> 00:00:13.833
Keep it down. He just woke up.

6
00:00:15.533 --> 00:00:16.333
accident

7
00:00:16.933 --> 00:00:17.966
But he's also divorced.

8
00:00:17.966 --> 00:00:20.133
I'm with him legally

9
00:00:20.133 --> 00:00:20.866
It is so nice of you.

10
00:00:20.866 --> 00:00:22.366
You finally stop for your own feelings

11
00:00:22.366 --> 00:00:23.300
Deliberately alienated him

12
00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:24.466
Congratulations, Mr. Gu

13
00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:26.800
But still give him a name

14
00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.166
Can't be wronged by him

15
00:00:28.533 --> 00:00:29.700
Do you want to marry her?

16
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:31.833
Then I'm going to find a wedding planning team now

17
00:00:32.766 --> 00:00:34.666
Should I propose first?

18
00:00:34.666 --> 00:00:35.600
Of course!

19
00:00:35.933 --> 00:00:37.866
Mr. Gu, the bracelet you bought last time.

20
00:00:37.866 --> 00:00:39.333
It finally came in handy this time

21
00:00:39.333 --> 00:00:41.533
However, you are still missing a ring.

22
00:00:41.533 --> 00:00:42.366
I'll find someone to customize it for you.

23
00:00:42.366 --> 00:00:44.133
Then I want to propose to her tomorrow.

24
00:00:44.133 --> 00:00:47.233
You can customize a wedding ring.

25
00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.800
You can buy the engagement ring at the store and buy it tomorrow morning.

26
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.000
You stay here and make sure he's safe

27
00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:56.200
Time is running out

28
00:00:56.366 --> 00:00:58.433
I hope he likes it.

29
00:01:02.966 --> 00:01:04.366
Hello Mr. Gu

30
00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.600
The dew was taken away. What did you do?

31
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.033
Didn't I tell you to look at him?

32
00:01:08.166 --> 00:01:08.966
I Am a Man

33
00:01:08.966 --> 00:01:10.100
It's a bit inconvenient to take care of him

34
00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:11.300
I'm looking for a nurse

35
00:01:11.466 --> 00:01:12.800
Just then, the nurse introduced a

36
00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.366
So I followed him outside.

37
00:01:14.366 --> 00:01:16.366
When he came back, he was gone.

38
00:01:16.366 --> 00:01:17.500
Fell to the ground

39
00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.100
Dew had obvious resistance

40
00:01:20.666 --> 00:01:21.966
Check the surveillance for me immediately

41
00:01:22.066 --> 00:01:23.133
Already checked

42
00:01:23.133 --> 00:01:24.666
It was taken by two men

43
00:01:24.666 --> 00:01:26.766
But they all wear hats and masks

44
00:01:26.866 --> 00:01:28.566
It is still unclear who ordered it.

45
00:01:28.666 --> 00:01:29.766
Then keep checking

46
00:01:29.766 --> 00:01:30.866
If you can't find it

47
00:01:30.866 --> 00:01:32.233
You cut yourself off
