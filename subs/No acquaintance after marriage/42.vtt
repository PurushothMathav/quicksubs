00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.400
Stay away from him

2
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.766
Why does Mr. Gu seem to be protecting me?

3
00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.866
But he didn't misunderstand me and Mr. Shen

4
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:13.766
Mr. Gu, I will chat with him

5
00:00:13.766 --> 00:00:15.633
I didn't dare to touch my hair

6
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.766
It is not suitable for Mr. Chen to come to our company to poach people, right?

7
00:00:19.766 --> 00:00:22.500
Mr. Gu, I'm kidding

8
00:00:22.733 --> 00:00:24.600
Like yesterday when I called you

9
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.100
That's a joke

10
00:00:26.166 --> 00:00:28.000
If you don't believe me, ask him.

11
00:00:28.533 --> 00:00:29.833
Ask me what?

12
00:00:30.866 --> 00:00:32.400
Why don't you come to the office with me?

13
00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:36.200
Lucy, I said the wrong thing on the phone yesterday

14
00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.400
You made Mr. Gu angry

15
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.000
The cooperation is terminated

16
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.600
You have to testify for me?

17
00:00:41.666 --> 00:00:42.533
What evidence?

18
00:00:42.533 --> 00:00:44.066
I didn't touch you!

19
00:00:44.066 --> 00:00:46.166
Just let you have a drink

20
00:00:47.166 --> 00:00:50.866
It turns out that Mr. Gu misunderstood Mr. Shen and bullied me

21
00:00:51.733 --> 00:00:55.400
Misunderstanding, so yesterday in the hospital he asked me if it hurt

22
00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.166
In fact, it was a misunderstanding that I was detained by Mr. Shen

23
00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.300
Yeah, I really haven't touched a finger.

24
00:01:02.466 --> 00:01:03.466
Then what are you talking about?

25
00:01:03.466 --> 00:01:05.366
Don't you misunderstand my innocence?

26
00:01:05.366 --> 00:01:07.733
I also want to make a joke with Mr. Gu

27
00:01:07.733 --> 00:01:09.666
Who would have thought he would take it seriously?

28
00:01:09.666 --> 00:01:10.966
Is that funny?

29
00:01:11.766 --> 00:01:12.600
apologize

30
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.766
I'm so sorry like him
