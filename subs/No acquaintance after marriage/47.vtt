00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:01.300
Hurt people and want to leave

2
00:00:01.666 --> 00:00:03.333
Brutal! Someone is stealing here!

3
00:00:03.333 --> 00:00:04.533
Haven't you learned your lesson yet?

4
00:00:04.533 --> 00:00:05.833
Give me back my stuff

5
00:00:06.333 --> 00:00:08.333
Security, someone here stole fine jewelry

6
00:00:08.333 --> 00:00:09.433
Come and catch him

7
00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:11.233
I bought that thing

8
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.866
I clearly saw that you stole it and wanted to quibble

9
00:00:13.866 --> 00:00:14.933
I'll tell you what.

10
00:00:14.933 --> 00:00:16.700
Slander is against the law

11
00:00:16.766 --> 00:00:17.666
Are you blind?

12
00:00:17.666 --> 00:00:19.066
Let go of me bitch

13
00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:20.166
Made me so miserable

14
00:00:20.166 --> 00:00:22.033
I'm going to kill you today.

15
00:00:24.466 --> 00:00:25.600
You are courting death

16
00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:27.666
Are you all right?

17
00:00:28.666 --> 00:00:29.500
Yeah.

18
00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.166
Things are ok

19
00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.000
What are you still doing?

20
00:00:36.933 --> 00:00:38.033
Sorry, sorry.

21
00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:39.333
Let you be wronged

22
00:00:39.333 --> 00:00:40.366
I'll handle it.

23
00:00:40.366 --> 00:00:41.266
Take it down

24
00:00:42.266 --> 00:00:44.566
This happens, affairs are not managed properly.

25
00:00:44.566 --> 00:00:45.666
As an apology

26
00:00:45.733 --> 00:00:48.166
I'm at the revolving restaurant on the top floor for the two of you

27
00:00:48.166 --> 00:00:50.066
Arranged a deluxe dinner for two

28
00:00:50.066 --> 00:00:52.500
After the meal, a group of gifts and a bowl in the suite are also included

29
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:53.866
I wish you two a happy wedding.

30
00:00:53.866 --> 00:00:56.266
No, you misunderstood us, baby.
