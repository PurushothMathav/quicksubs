1
00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:03.566
I'll take this skirt.

2
00:00:03.733 --> 00:00:05.800
Miss Shen, I'm really sorry.

3
00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:08.400
This dress has been bought by this lady.

4
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.600
We have other new models in our store for the season.

5
00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:12.400
Why not you?

6
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:13.833
I'll take it.

7
00:00:14.166 --> 00:00:15.166
Please deal with it quickly.

8
00:00:15.166 --> 00:00:15.933
I'm in a hurry.

9
00:00:15.933 --> 00:00:17.266
I heard that the VIP of your store

10
00:00:17.266 --> 00:00:18.900
Customers have the right of first refusal

11
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.266
So do you need me to call your manager?

12
00:00:21.766 --> 00:00:22.966
Ah ok Miss Shen

13
00:00:22.966 --> 00:00:24.800
I'll wrap the skirt for you right now.

14
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:25.866
Count you realize

15
00:00:25.866 --> 00:00:27.700
Even if you are a VIP customer

16
00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:29.066
Also pay attention to first come first served

17
00:00:29.066 --> 00:00:31.166
This dress is what I like about you first

18
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:33.400
Your monthly salary

19
00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.166
Do you have enough for a fraction of this dress?

20
00:00:35.166 --> 00:00:35.933
Anyway

21
00:00:35.933 --> 00:00:38.500
Why don't you replace your sleazy miscellaneous brand first?

22
00:00:38.533 --> 00:00:40.833
Whether I can afford it or not is my business

23
00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.200
But if you're not being reasonable

24
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.400
Then call the manager.

25
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.066
Do you think this is your home?

26
00:00:46.066 --> 00:00:47.800
Call whoever you want

27
00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:49.633
Kick him out

28
00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:51.500
The sad Miss Shen

29
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:52.666
I'll drive him away

30
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.166
Let go, I advise you to leave quickly

31
00:00:55.166 --> 00:00:56.700
Or I'll call security

32
00:00:57.333 --> 00:00:58.600
Zhao Yun, right?

33
00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.200
I'll call now to complain.

34
00:01:00.866 --> 00:01:03.100
Ouch, do you think I'm afraid of you?

35
00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:04.900
Security, there's a disturbance here

36
00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:06.166
Miss Shen, I'm sorry.

37
00:01:06.166 --> 00:01:07.366
Please wait here for a while.

38
00:01:07.366 --> 00:01:10.033
I don't want to wait 100,000

39
00:01:10.133 --> 00:01:11.266
Drive him away now

40
00:01:11.333 --> 00:01:13.400
Okay, Miss Shen, dare you touch me?

41
00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:14.566
Stop me
