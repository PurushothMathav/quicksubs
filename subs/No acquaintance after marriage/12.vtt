00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:01.366
Don't move

2
00:00:06.566 --> 00:00:09.866
It's so embarrassing. He doesn't think I did it on purpose, does he?

3
00:00:11.933 --> 00:00:12.866
Not yet awake

4
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.700
My skin is more

5
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.000
Say

6
00:00:23.566 --> 00:00:24.733
Wait a minute I have something to do

7
00:00:24.733 --> 00:00:26.333
Is this the case today?

8
00:00:26.333 --> 00:00:27.866
Then I'll give you a car.

9
00:00:27.966 --> 00:00:29.066
You stay here.

10
00:00:29.333 --> 00:00:31.066
Next week is my mother's birthday.

11
00:00:31.133 --> 00:00:32.566
Please help me choose a gift.

12
00:00:33.533 --> 00:00:35.333
If there is, I will buy it directly.

13
00:00:35.333 --> 00:00:36.866
Hmm, whatever

14
00:00:43.333 --> 00:00:44.300
Welcome.

15
00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:45.900
What do you need?

16
00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:47.300
I'll take a look first

17
00:00:48.866 --> 00:00:50.833
I don't know what your budget is.

18
00:00:51.133 --> 00:00:53.900
I'm not sure. I'll see if there is any suitable one first.

19
00:00:54.566 --> 00:00:56.300
This is our discount section.

20
00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.000
There should be what you need.

21
00:00:58.133 --> 00:00:59.166
See for yourself.

22
00:00:59.166 --> 00:01:00.900
But don't touch it

23
00:01:07.133 --> 00:01:08.566
I said don't touch it

24
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.966
This is the most we just flew in from France

25
00:01:10.966 --> 00:01:11.700
New model

26
00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.233
This is the only one in the world.

27
00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.100
Can you afford a broken cat?

28
00:01:16.266 --> 00:01:18.766
Your home is an internationally renowned brand after all

29
00:01:18.766 --> 00:01:20.100
Is the service attitude like this?

30
00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.166
If you are our VIP customer

31
00:01:22.166 --> 00:01:24.000
We are naturally respectful

32
00:01:24.066 --> 00:01:27.033
Be patient when buying gifts for the old lady

33
00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:29.566
Wrap it up, you can afford it.

34
00:01:29.566 --> 00:01:31.633
Don't you understand?

35
00:01:31.866 --> 00:01:34.800
Yes, yes, yes, I'll wrap it up for you and wait a minute.

36
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.766
I'll take this skirt.
