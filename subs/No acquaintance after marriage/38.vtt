00:00:00.733 --> 00:00:03.300
Why did Mrs. Gu suddenly come here yesterday?

2
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:04.566
While in the hospital

3
00:00:04.566 --> 00:00:06.733
Why did Mr. Gu say that he should apologize?

4
00:00:06.733 --> 00:00:09.066
They both have the surname Gu?

5
00:00:11.133 --> 00:00:14.300
Qiqi, who did Mrs. Gu come to find just now?

6
00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:15.500
Find Mr. Gu first

7
00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:16.533
Looking for you later

8
00:00:16.533 --> 00:00:19.233
By the way, he also gave me a business card

9
00:00:19.333 --> 00:00:20.766
Said that when you come back

10
00:00:20.766 --> 00:00:22.266
Just call him and tell him

11
00:00:22.666 --> 00:00:24.200
Looks fierce

12
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.166
Is it because of my affair with Mr. Gu?

13
00:00:27.166 --> 00:00:28.266
Specially found

14
00:00:28.266 --> 00:00:29.200
His surname is also Gu

15
00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:30.133
To tell you the truth

16
00:00:30.133 --> 00:00:32.466
I thought he and Mr. Gu were mother and son at first

17
00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:34.866
But I heard it from him.

18
00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:36.366
I met Mr. Gu at the Chamber of Commerce

19
00:00:36.366 --> 00:00:37.966
Came to talk to him about business

20
00:00:38.333 --> 00:00:40.500
He doesn't look familiar with Mr. Gu at all

21
00:00:40.766 --> 00:00:43.600
Well, it seems that I think too much.

22
00:00:43.766 --> 00:00:46.300
It is also true that Mr. Gu is Zhao Tingchuan

23
00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.666
How could the Zhao family allow him to change his surname?

24
00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.466
Is there anything wrong with the cooperation between Rosse and Shen?

25
00:00:55.966 --> 00:00:57.900
Why do you ask that?

26
00:00:57.966 --> 00:00:59.200
I just got the news.

27
00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:00.366
Said the cooperation was terminated

28
00:01:00.466 --> 00:01:02.300
No, no one informed me.

29
00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.200
It's a message from Assistant Duan.

30
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:06.300
It shouldn't be wrong, I'm just a pity.

31
00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:07.966
We spent more than half a year

32
00:01:07.966 --> 00:01:09.100
Fall on this project

33
00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.066
Especially when you work overtime day and night

34
00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:12.866
I'll ask

35
00:01:19.133 --> 00:01:23.166
Mr. Gu, I heard that the cooperation with review has been cancelled.

36
00:01:23.166 --> 00:01:25.100
Why do you have an opinion

37
00:01:25.266 --> 00:01:26.100
dare not

38
00:01:26.533 --> 00:01:29.533
But I am the POC of this project after all.

39
00:01:29.533 --> 00:01:31.666
At least I should know why

40
00:01:32.733 --> 00:01:33.866
Yes, I mean it.

41
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.000
Mr. Gu

42
00:01:35.166 --> 00:01:38.066
This project poses little risk to our company

43
00:01:38.066 --> 00:01:40.800
High profits are really good for our company

44
00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:42.166
You are so reluctant

45
00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.100
Is reluctant to cooperate

46
00:01:44.166 --> 00:01:45.500
Still reluctant to be tried

47
00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:46.966
What do you mean?
