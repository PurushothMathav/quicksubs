1
00:00:00.533 --> 00:00:02.400
Divorce agreement, I've done it for you

2
00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:04.200
Ask Yun Yao to come and sign today

3
00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:05.966
Wait, what are you waiting for?

4
00:00:05.966 --> 00:00:09.100
If your grandfather hadn't invited you with his estate

5
00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:11.266
I can marry a commoner like her for three years

6
00:00:11.266 --> 00:00:12.766
He must not delay us any longer

7
00:00:12.766 --> 00:00:14.033
I have arrangements

8
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:14.733
Don't worry about it.

9
00:00:14.733 --> 00:00:15.900
Yesterday was an accident

10
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:16.933
But it's also marital infidelity

11
00:00:16.933 --> 00:00:18.533
The compensation clause needs to be re-added.

12
00:00:18.533 --> 00:00:20.700
If you don't divorce, what about Shen Pinting?

13
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:24.233
I hear you have been busy with your business abroad these years.

14
00:00:24.466 --> 00:00:26.500
Your mother is sick and she takes care of you.

15
00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:27.866
You can't let them down

16
00:00:27.866 --> 00:00:29.500
There are many ways to be grateful

17
00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.700
It's impossible to marry her

18
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:33.133
I have promised him.

19
00:00:33.133 --> 00:00:34.966
I'll let you two get married as soon as you return home

20
00:00:34.966 --> 00:00:36.900
Mom, I have a wife.

21
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:38.533
What kind of wife is Yun Yao to you?

22
00:00:38.533 --> 00:00:41.100
The marriage license was still made by your grandfather

23
00:00:41.133 --> 00:00:43.300
Who else knows him but your grandpa and me?

24
00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:44.866
I said it was him.

25
00:00:44.866 --> 00:00:46.133
What about you, Shen Ping?

26
00:00:46.133 --> 00:00:48.066
He is the eldest lady of the Shen family

27
00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.000
The Shen family is not a small family

28
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.300
Not so easy to pass

29
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.166
What you caused

30
00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:55.800
You handle it yourself

31
00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:57.400
Hey

32
00:01:03.666 --> 00:01:06.400
The old master is 57 minutes from 9:00 to now

33
00:01:06.666 --> 00:01:08.200
Why don't you just wait a little longer?

34
00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.900
Sorry, there was an accident just now.

35
00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:12.733
I was surprised

36
00:01:12.733 --> 00:01:15.300
I think it's a night of surfing and not feeling happy

37
00:01:19.666 --> 00:01:22.200
I didn't expect you to look innocent

38
00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.500
Playing so much in private

39
00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.066
I really can't compare to you

40
00:01:26.066 --> 00:01:28.800
You look even hotter

41
00:01:28.966 --> 00:01:29.966
Stop

42
00:01:31.133 --> 00:01:32.966
Mr. Gu visited the company for the first time

43
00:01:32.966 --> 00:01:34.766
Don't make trouble for me at this time

44
00:01:35.333 --> 00:01:36.133
Mr. Gu

45
00:01:38.166 --> 00:01:39.500
Duan Te ordered

46
00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.466
You need a personal secretary to come to the company

47
00:01:41.466 --> 00:01:43.633
These two are candidates Lucy

48
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.466
And Shen Pinting

49
00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:46.766
Take a look.

50
00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:48.233
Who to choose?

51
00:01:53.166 --> 00:01:54.266
It's You
