00:00:01.933 --> 00:00:04.633
Oops, forgot to mute my personal phone.

2
00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.666
Sorry, I need to take this

3
00:00:11.066 --> 00:00:12.466
This is crazy.

4
00:00:12.566 --> 00:00:14.400
I actually thought he was Yunyao

5
00:00:17.133 --> 00:00:19.000
Hello, please hold the line.

6
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.400
The number you dialed is on the phone

7
00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:23.200
He told me.

8
00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.300
Then come to me tomorrow with the agreement

9
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.033
How dare you seduce my fiancé

10
00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:38.500
It's ridiculous

11
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.000
You have only been in the company for half a month.

12
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:40.866
You and I are not familiar

13
00:00:40.866 --> 00:00:43.400
Not to mention your fiancé, you still pretend

14
00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:48.866
If you are mentally ill, go to the hospital

15
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.066
Don't mess around here

16
00:00:50.066 --> 00:00:52.266
How dare you hit my bodyguard?

17
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:54.500
Ah!

18
00:00:55.733 --> 00:00:57.500
Dare to rob my people

19
00:00:58.566 --> 00:00:59.666
I'm useless

20
00:01:02.266 --> 00:01:03.233
Stop it!

21
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:05.666
How can you be so bullying?

22
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:07.966
Are you all right?

23
00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:11.366
Manager Liu, I kindly remind you

24
00:01:12.166 --> 00:01:13.666
He's a slut

25
00:01:13.666 --> 00:01:15.766
I don't know how many men are out there

26
00:01:15.866 --> 00:01:17.966
Don't be a fool to be a pick-up man

27
00:01:17.966 --> 00:01:19.300
What nonsense are you talking about?

28
00:01:19.333 --> 00:01:20.566
I am your leader.

29
00:01:20.566 --> 00:01:24.766
It is the leader who takes special care of him

30
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:25.733
Manager Liu

31
00:01:25.733 --> 00:01:28.966
I suggest you stay out of your business.

32
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.700
Otherwise I'll let you walk around

33
00:01:31.733 --> 00:01:34.266
The bodyguard pulled him away

34
00:01:34.266 --> 00:01:36.566
Chen Piting, don't mess around

35
00:01:36.566 --> 00:01:38.800
You can't hide your smelly smell

36
00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:40.500
What else are you wearing?

37
00:01:41.333 --> 00:01:43.600
You let go. You let go.
