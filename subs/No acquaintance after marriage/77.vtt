00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.300
Why did you run away after opening the table?

3
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:07.700
I've been looking for you everywhere

4
00:00:07.966 --> 00:00:09.766
Mom, what's the matter?

5
00:00:10.366 --> 00:00:12.400

00:00:29.566 --> 00:00:32.366

Stop and don't let me say

16
00:00:44.766 --> 00:00:46.866
It's okay I'm his mother

17
00:00:46.866 --> 00:00:48.300
Just say it.

18
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.166
No way.

19
00:00:49.166 --> 00:00:51.666
If he finds out, he won't want me.
