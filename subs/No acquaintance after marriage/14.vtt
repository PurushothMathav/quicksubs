1
00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:02.300
Stop me

2
00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:05.100
The store manager, this customer, he doesn't buy anything.

3
00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:06.366
Still making trouble here

4
00:00:06.466 --> 00:00:09.300
I broke all the skirts that Miss Shen liked.

5
00:00:09.466 --> 00:00:11.200
Miss Shen is kind-hearted and indifferent

6
00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:14.100
Just let him go and he refuses to scold me for shutting up

7
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.033
I just received news that the boss is coming to inspect today.

8
00:00:18.133 --> 00:00:20.166
Miss Shen has always had a temper

9
00:00:20.166 --> 00:00:21.133
Can't afford to offend

10
00:00:21.133 --> 00:00:22.400
You have to deal with it quickly

11
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.100
Madam, I'm so sorry.

12
00:00:24.166 --> 00:00:25.900
Miss Shen is a VIP customer.

13
00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:27.833
There is indeed a right of first refusal.

14
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:29.933
This dress is not a limited edition.

15
00:00:29.933 --> 00:00:31.966
I will transfer the goods back from abroad for you immediately.

16
00:00:31.966 --> 00:00:33.833
It will be delivered to your door then.

17
00:00:34.166 --> 00:00:36.566
What if I am also a VIP customer?

18
00:00:36.566 --> 00:00:38.633
Lucy, you said

19
00:00:39.066 --> 00:00:40.466
Become a VIP customer here

20
00:00:40.466 --> 00:00:44.000
If the annual consumption reaches more than 1 million yuan, it is up to you

21
00:00:46.733 --> 00:00:47.666
Use this.

22
00:00:49.733 --> 00:00:51.966
This black gold dragon pattern

23
00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:53.466
How is that possible?

24
00:00:53.666 --> 00:00:56.400
Is there anything different about the store manager?

25
00:00:56.666 --> 00:00:58.966
The black gold dragon pattern of the world's brocade clothes

26
00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.566
It is a symbol of the status of the supreme power

27
00:01:02.133 --> 00:01:03.866
It is said that he can be transferred at will

28
00:01:03.866 --> 00:01:06.166
Global assets are at least 10 trillion

29
00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:07.400
His owner

30
00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.933
But the ultimate in the world's top luxury goods industry

31
00:01:09.933 --> 00:01:11.033
target customer

32
00:01:11.666 --> 00:01:13.166
Such a distinguished card

33
00:01:13.333 --> 00:01:15.633
How could it be in the hands of one of his inferior people?

34
00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:19.133
But I see he looks the same.

35
00:01:19.133 --> 00:01:20.733
That's what he copied

36
00:01:20.733 --> 00:01:22.666
There's no money in it at all

37
00:01:23.066 --> 00:01:24.033
Then not

38
00:01:24.866 --> 00:01:25.866
Brush to see

39
00:01:29.366 --> 00:01:30.666
Can't identify

40
00:01:31.733 --> 00:01:34.000
Look, I'm fake

41
00:01:34.333 --> 00:01:35.200
You see

42
00:01:36.133 --> 00:01:37.766
It's all like this, you still act

43
00:01:37.766 --> 00:01:39.466
Take us for fools

44
00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.266
This lady asks you to go out
