00:00:00.566 --> 00:00:01.900
The child is saved again

2
00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:06.066
Thank you. Thank you.

3
00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:07.900
He's got bruises all over his stomach

4
00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:09.066
Really lucky

5
00:00:09.166 --> 00:00:10.700
He was obviously mistreated.

6
00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:12.866
I think doctors have an obligation to call the police.

7
00:00:12.866 --> 00:00:14.066
Don't blame me.

8
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Sorry.

9
00:00:25.266 --> 00:00:26.433
Sorry.

10
00:00:27.566 --> 00:00:29.566
No, the old lady was taken away

11
00:00:29.566 --> 00:00:30.866
Do you need me to pick him up?

12
00:00:30.933 --> 00:00:32.700
Let him stay in there for two days

13
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.300
Aren't you afraid that he will hate you?

14
00:00:35.466 --> 00:00:37.033
Gotta teach him a lesson

15
00:00:37.766 --> 00:00:39.766
Otherwise it will kill you

16
00:00:39.766 --> 00:00:41.000
It's too late.

17
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.033
And it depends on what he means.

18
00:00:46.133 --> 00:00:48.766
Then go to him first, Xiao An

19
00:00:49.566 --> 00:00:50.466
That's right.

20
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.400
Yunyao has already sent someone to his house to check the account.

21
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.400
Not on his mother's side or in

22
00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:56.900
Should be hiding

23
00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.833
I remember there was a small company on his mother's side

24
00:00:59.866 --> 00:01:01.300
Maybe we can start here

25
00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:02.366
Force him out

26
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.166
OK

27
00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:06.633
child

28
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.966
The child is alright, the child is alright

29
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.666
It's fine

30
00:01:13.933 --> 00:01:15.233
It's fine

31
00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:16.833
You still have injuries

32
00:01:16.866 --> 00:01:18.100
Don't move too much

33
00:01:21.166 --> 00:01:22.100
Sorry.

34
00:01:22.766 --> 00:01:24.466
I didn't protect you well.

35
00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.233
I don't blame you, it's my fault.

36
00:01:28.766 --> 00:01:30.666
This time it's my debt

37
00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.366
Hope the baby is ok

38
00:01:33.866 --> 00:01:34.666
Luzi

39
00:01:35.166 --> 00:01:36.166
Old lady checkmark

40
00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:38.900
What's up?
