00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:01.133
You make a price

2
00:00:01.133 --> 00:00:03.066
As long as you can fix the video inside.

3
00:00:03.066 --> 00:00:04.766
I'll pay any amount.

4
00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:07.766
Put the mobile phone with me first, and I will notify you when there is a door.

5
00:00:07.766 --> 00:00:08.566
OK

6
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.666
This video was exchanged by Guoguo with his life

7
00:00:14.666 --> 00:00:17.433
If I can't fix it, how can I be worthy of him?

8
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.266
Did you take that little bitch

9
00:00:31.266 --> 00:00:32.866
The dog's phone was repaired

10
00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:34.833
What phone?

11
00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:36.833
You're still pretending to be stupid

12
00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:40.766
I used to go looking for someone

13
00:00:40.766 --> 00:00:42.600
Ask the owner of the repair shop to pass

14
00:00:42.733 --> 00:00:44.666
He said you took it to fix it.

15
00:00:48.766 --> 00:00:51.500
I did find this phone under the sofa

16
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.800
I just want to fix it for my own use

17
00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:56.433
Or forget it.

18
00:00:56.966 --> 00:00:58.333
I have got the phone.

19
00:00:58.333 --> 00:01:00.466
I want the kid to use it. My minister knows.

20
00:01:02.366 --> 00:01:04.800
Did you see this little bitch crying?

21
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.000
Chu poor

22
00:01:07.466 --> 00:01:08.600
I'm so tired.

23
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.500
You don't think

24
00:01:14.533 --> 00:01:17.766
It's amazing to have a man speak for you

25
00:01:18.366 --> 00:01:20.400
Since you like kneeling so much

26
00:01:21.666 --> 00:01:23.566
Then kneel until I'm satisfied

27
00:01:26.566 --> 00:01:27.866
You stare at Chen Lin here

28
00:01:28.066 --> 00:01:29.433
Without my permission

29
00:01:29.533 --> 00:01:30.633
He can't come in.

30
00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.100
Yes, ma'am.

31
00:01:37.866 --> 00:01:40.700
I'm fine uncle, I'm used to kneeling

32
00:01:40.866 --> 00:01:42.400
Go find your aunt

33
00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.466
Otherwise he will be angry again later.

34
00:01:47.133 --> 00:01:48.233
Talk to you, don't freeze

35
00:01:48.933 --> 00:01:52.233
I'm not cold, don't get my uncle's clothes dirty
