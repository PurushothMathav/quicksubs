00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:01.200
Aunt Wang Yu

2
00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:03.866
I came here mainly to inform you

3
00:00:03.866 --> 00:00:05.800
My love affair with Aiyu

4
00:00:06.866 --> 00:00:07.833
Mr. Xiao Jiang

5
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:10.200
That can't be true, can it?

6
00:00:11.366 --> 00:00:12.900
What he said is true

7
00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:16.400
Xiaoyu

8
00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.933
You don't know what kind of person Chen Ling is

9
00:00:18.933 --> 00:00:20.933
Did he seduce the future?

10
00:00:20.933 --> 00:00:21.966
I know.

11
00:00:22.333 --> 00:00:24.200
Didn't you also seduce the future?

12
00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.900
Auntie, your close girl has a rich one at least

13
00:00:31.066 --> 00:00:32.700
Wukong Kong

14
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.500
Aren't you happy for me?

15
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:36.800
Chen Lin

16
00:00:37.733 --> 00:00:38.966
Come with me.

17
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.466
You little girl

18
00:00:47.466 --> 00:00:49.000
Dare to hook up with Jiang Yu

19
00:00:49.066 --> 00:00:51.233
Can't this dear?

20
00:00:51.366 --> 00:00:55.066
But Yu and I have no parents

21
00:00:55.066 --> 00:00:56.100
Who said she had nothing?

22
00:00:59.366 --> 00:01:00.933
I wouldn't agree to it anyway.

23
00:01:00.933 --> 00:01:02.966
It's your dad's ex-wife

24
00:01:02.966 --> 00:01:06.300
He went to sleep with your marriage

25
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.100
Nature lets me prove it.

26
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.500
Why are you treating me?

27
00:01:10.733 --> 00:01:11.966
It's you

28
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.100
I'd like to see if you can still guard Lin's

29
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.100
How dare you speak to me like that

30
00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.300
I just don't get it.

31
00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:24.000
Did so many bad things

32
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.366
How can you justifiably call Xu Ran?

33
00:01:26.733 --> 00:01:27.766
Say what?

34
00:01:29.066 --> 00:01:31.066
Check your phone for yourself

35
00:01:31.566 --> 00:01:34.433
How nice it would be to die for snacks and dogs

36
00:01:34.466 --> 00:01:35.966
You can marry me

37
00:01:35.966 --> 00:01:39.600
You said that if this video is watched by others

38
00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:40.500
What can be done?

39
00:01:46.366 --> 00:01:47.266
Brother

40
00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.900
Although I don't know where you got this video from

41
00:01:50.133 --> 00:01:51.366
But he can't explain

42
00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.200
If you really have any substantive evidence

43
00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.666
Go to the police early

44
00:01:55.733 --> 00:01:57.866
Instead of sitting here and threatening me

45
00:01:57.866 --> 00:01:59.200
That net appointment aunt

46
00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.566
Better to pray for the bad things you've done

47
00:02:01.566 --> 00:02:03.200
Flawless handling

48
00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.833
But don't let me find any evidence

49
00:02:10.266 --> 00:02:13.766
The residue is what you forced me to do

50
00:02:17.533 --> 00:02:18.866
Arrange it for me.

51
00:02:21.333 --> 00:02:22.766
Don't ruin Chen Lin
