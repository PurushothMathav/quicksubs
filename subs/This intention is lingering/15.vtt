1
00:00:00.966 --> 00:00:02.700
Get out of here now

2
00:00:02.733 --> 00:00:03.566
Stop

3
00:00:04.266 --> 00:00:05.966
What will you do in the future?

4
00:00:06.166 --> 00:00:07.466
You go out first

5
00:00:07.766 --> 00:00:08.866
Uncle aunt

6
00:00:08.933 --> 00:00:10.600
Then I'll retire first

7
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.366
Will you be cheap in the future?

8
00:00:18.733 --> 00:00:21.166
You are still helping Chen Ling at this time

9
00:00:21.366 --> 00:00:24.000
It's not all your fault for doing things crazy in the first place

10
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.466
He has a video of us both saying it killed people

11
00:00:26.466 --> 00:00:28.433
Take this and write that I want the rest of the shares

12
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.700
You really gave it to him

13
00:00:44.133 --> 00:00:46.166
What can I do in an emergency?

14
00:00:46.566 --> 00:00:48.033
You fool

15
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.166
The handle is in hand for a day

16
00:00:50.166 --> 00:00:52.000
He can haunt you for the rest of his life

17
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:54.433
What to do, dear?

18
00:00:55.766 --> 00:00:56.900
I'll figure it out

19
00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.200
Your brain is not clear

20
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.066
Now the money is gone.

21
00:01:01.066 --> 00:01:03.766
I'll help you, what am I drawing?

22
00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:05.200
Wang Yu

23
00:01:06.266 --> 00:01:08.100
I am you using the full value

24
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.800
Tools that can be thrown away?

25
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.066
You couldn't control your lower body in the first place

26
00:01:12.066 --> 00:01:14.500
Being played around by a little girl liar

27
00:01:15.366 --> 00:01:17.300
What qualifications do you have

28
00:01:21.066 --> 00:01:22.266
Wang Yu failed the estimate

29
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.666
Lawyer Wang will kill me in the future

30
00:01:29.133 --> 00:01:30.866
You must send him to prison

31
00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:34.000
Did your uncle really hurt you?

32
00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.400
Aunt Wang Yu's powerful means

33
00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.600
Uncle, how can I compare to you?
