1
00:00:04.133 --> 00:00:06.166
You threw the pot directly at me

2
00:00:06.733 --> 00:00:08.666
Now the chairperson has asked me to step down

3
00:00:08.666 --> 00:00:09.133
What should we do?

4
00:00:09.133 --> 00:00:09.933
Now.

5
00:00:10.566 --> 00:00:13.200
I warned you to stay away from Chen Lin

6
00:00:13.333 --> 00:00:14.633
You have to listen

7
00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:18.166
I can help you.

8
00:00:18.333 --> 00:00:20.800
But I want 10% of the temporary company shares

9
00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:23.900
Crazy about money

10
00:00:24.666 --> 00:00:27.766
I finally got that from you

11
00:00:28.733 --> 00:00:30.000
It's up to you.

12
00:00:30.333 --> 00:00:31.566
I told you.

13
00:00:31.566 --> 00:00:32.766
If it's a big deal, the same style will be given away.

14
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.600
But make sure you can solve it.

15
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.633
Don't worry, Chen Lin's little tricks can't scare you

16
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.000
From today onwards

17
00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:48.900
Get out of this house

18
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.400
Now the temporary aunt's company is facing an appreciation failure

19
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.800
I will lose my trust in the company in the future

20
00:00:56.066 --> 00:00:59.433
Who do you think you can rely on?

21
00:01:02.366 --> 00:01:03.300
Is the group president

22
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.633
He will be interviewed at the company gate in the future

23
00:01:05.866 --> 00:01:09.866
Guys, I'm giving 10% of the company to my wife

24
00:01:09.866 --> 00:01:11.000
As a gift

25
00:01:11.766 --> 00:01:13.433
Our bond is unbreakable.

26
00:01:13.733 --> 00:01:15.166
They always have innocence

27
00:01:15.166 --> 00:01:17.766
Other things that don't exist

28
00:01:17.766 --> 00:01:20.100
It will never affect the listing of our company.

29
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.400
Investors please rest assured to inject capital

30
00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:23.200
Thanks.

31
00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.300
He would be willing to give you the shares

32
00:01:28.266 --> 00:01:30.633
Oops I told you

33
00:01:30.666 --> 00:01:34.766
I am more reliable than my relationship with future interests

34
00:01:36.566 --> 00:01:38.700
Is that right, Aunt Wang Yi?

35
00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:41.000
Then have you ever heard a saying

36
00:01:41.166 --> 00:01:42.566
Skynet is back

37
00:01:45.733 --> 00:01:47.200
What do you mean?

38
00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.366
It means nothing

39
00:01:48.366 --> 00:01:50.300
Just wanted to remind you

40
00:01:50.333 --> 00:01:51.866
Too much walking at night

41
00:01:51.866 --> 00:01:54.600
I will meet you sooner or later

42
00:02:00.266 --> 00:02:02.966
The video in the lady's white phone was successfully restored.

43
00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:07.600
Future uncle

44
00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:09.266
I want you to meet.
