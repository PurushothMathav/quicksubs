00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:18.966
Ah, go away

2
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.300
Mr. Jiang, how do you write it?

3
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.066
You think I'll be like that stupid man in the future

4
00:00:27.133 --> 00:00:28.233
I was framed by you obediently

5
00:00:29.866 --> 00:00:33.066
I've turned your rumors in the company into evidence

6
00:00:33.133 --> 00:00:35.466
The evidence that you and I have imported into the upper echelons has been collected

7
00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:37.433
Get ready for evidence

8
00:00:37.733 --> 00:00:39.766
Please go please forgive me

9
00:00:39.766 --> 00:00:41.166
I just don't want you and Chen Lin

10
00:00:41.166 --> 00:00:42.566
That wild girl together

11
00:00:42.566 --> 00:00:45.566
What right do you have to point fingers at me?

12
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.400
Do you really have the heart to look at your own

13
00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.066
Was the mother down and out?

14
00:00:51.533 --> 00:00:52.766
Pardon me?

15
00:00:52.766 --> 00:00:54.100
I'm mom

16
00:00:54.566 --> 00:00:57.066
I knew Xiaoyu wouldn't be so cruel

17
00:00:58.600 --> 00:00:59.800
Give me the phone

18
00:01:00.266 --> 00:01:03.900
What? I know you're lazy. Somebody give me your phone

19
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.300
If I don't give

20
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.600
I have ways to hack into your phone

21
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:10.666
Delete the video

22
00:01:10.666 --> 00:01:13.200
If you don't cooperate, I'll make your life worse than death

23
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.100
Why are you not surprised?

24
00:01:26.133 --> 00:01:29.266
Did you already know that I am your mother?

25
00:01:29.766 --> 00:01:32.366
I've seen you many times at the orphanage

26
00:01:32.366 --> 00:01:34.666
Every time you come to the corner to peek at me

27
00:01:35.066 --> 00:01:35.900
That time

28
00:01:36.066 --> 00:01:38.166
I overheard a conversation like this.

29
00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.100
Did you send me to the orphanage on purpose?

30
00:01:42.333 --> 00:01:45.633
I just want to find a chance to temporarily raise your son for you

31
00:01:46.066 --> 00:01:47.633
You know the temporary green hills

32
00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.600
Will raise an orphan to adulthood

33
00:01:50.566 --> 00:01:52.033
Heard it all

34
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:53.733
I thought

35
00:01:53.733 --> 00:01:55.900
I have your rotten blood on me

36
00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.433
I feel sick

37
00:01:58.066 --> 00:02:01.466
Don't try to use the blood relationship, you don't deserve it

38
00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.800
I don't deserve it, does he deserve it?

39
00:02:07.066 --> 00:02:09.233
He can't even protect his own daughter

40
00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:12.300
Don't lift the corpse in front of me

41
00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.466
I'll make you die miserably

42
00:02:32.566 --> 00:02:33.366
Jiang Yu

43
00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:35.833
You've been drinking?

44
00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.800
Don't be like this, why is Jiang Yu so abnormal today?

45
00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.666
Is there something going on that I don't know about?
