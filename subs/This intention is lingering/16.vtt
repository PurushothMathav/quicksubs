1
00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:02.466
Aunt Wang Yu's powerful means

2
00:00:02.466 --> 00:00:04.100
Uncle can't compare to you

3
00:00:05.266 --> 00:00:06.600
Wang Ri will pass the estimate

4
00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:15.033
In the future, you will not think that this family

5
00:00:15.766 --> 00:00:17.900
It's up to you

6
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.200
Kobayashi has flattered

7
00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:27.600
Face the enemy

8
00:00:27.766 --> 00:00:30.400
One must be preserved

9
00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:34.000
You saw what happened to your uncle

10
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.700
But don't allow your uncle

11
00:00:36.166 --> 00:00:39.200
Of course, bad things happen.

12
00:00:39.333 --> 00:00:41.833
Nature pays for itself.

13
00:00:42.066 --> 00:00:44.766
Future talk is the first example

14
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.866
Here's a second example.

15
00:00:47.366 --> 00:00:48.666
Who could it be?

16
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.100
What will Lawyer Wang's uncle do in the future?

17
00:00:53.133 --> 00:00:55.000
Preliminary conviction for intentional wounding

18
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.633
The follow-up situation also depends on the victim's injury

19
00:00:57.666 --> 00:00:59.566
But you can't escape jail

20
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.966
It's all from this scum in the future, Yingde

21
00:01:03.133 --> 00:01:03.866
GuoGuo

22
00:01:03.866 --> 00:01:07.700
You wait for mom to send the bad guys in one by one

23
00:01:07.766 --> 00:01:08.933
Lawyer Wang, I see.

24
00:01:08.933 --> 00:01:10.166
Go to work

25
00:01:15.866 --> 00:01:17.633
What were you implying just now?

26
00:01:17.933 --> 00:01:19.700
Believe it or not, I will send you to prison.

27
00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.100
Reunion with the future?

28
00:01:21.933 --> 00:01:25.266
Of course I believe that Aunt Wang Yu has this ability

29
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.166
You just stabbed yourself

30
00:01:28.666 --> 00:01:31.366
You can take all the bad things you've done

31
00:01:31.366 --> 00:01:33.066
Push it all to the channel

32
00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.000
Pick yourself clean

33
00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.200
What nonsense are you talking about?

34
00:01:39.566 --> 00:01:41.800
You're out of your mind again

35
00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.366
To think people don't know

36
00:01:47.366 --> 00:01:49.266
Unless you don't

37
00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:54.233
All the bad things you've done are known

38
00:01:55.266 --> 00:01:56.800
You know, so what?

39
00:01:56.866 --> 00:01:59.466
I'm about to become the new director of the company

40
00:01:59.466 --> 00:02:01.433
You've done so much

41
00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:03.966
Still didn't shake me

42
00:02:04.466 --> 00:02:07.500
And you, you bereaved soldier

43
00:02:08.066 --> 00:02:10.266
Why don't you get out of here?

44
00:02:21.533 --> 00:02:23.366
Hey, I'll go crazy in the future.

45
00:02:23.366 --> 00:02:25.000
Sent to a mental hospital

46
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.666
And I saw Jiang Yu

47
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.833
Jiang Yu

48
00:02:32.866 --> 00:02:33.566
Jiang Yu

49
00:02:33.566 --> 00:02:36.100
Me and the student who helped herself in the future

50
00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:37.200
He is the kindest

51
00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.366
Coming back at this time should not help the future, right?
