00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:03.666
Have a drink

2
00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.200
Hmm, does the handsome guy have a pen?

3
00:00:07.866 --> 00:00:09.333
Turn right when you go out, there is a convenience store

4
00:00:09.333 --> 00:00:10.266
You can go there to play.

5
00:00:11.266 --> 00:00:12.700
Play hard to get with me

6
00:00:13.666 --> 00:00:15.000
Do you have paper?

7
00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.000
I can't believe you're not moving

8
00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.100
I'll see who you're calling then.

9
00:00:26.133 --> 00:00:29.800
Wife, he's calling me, what's the matter?

10
00:00:32.966 --> 00:00:34.700
You say you are busy every day.

11
00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.000
Busy with this?

12
00:00:36.533 --> 00:00:38.233
You are his wife

13
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:41.100
What a pity!

14
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.900
This handsome guy not only got married a year early, but also has a child

15
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:46.366
GuoGuo

16
00:00:46.933 --> 00:00:48.166
Mom?

17
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.600
Who is Auntie?

18
00:00:55.266 --> 00:00:57.200
You actually call me auntie

19
00:01:02.466 --> 00:01:04.433
Honey, let's have another child

20
00:01:04.533 --> 00:01:06.300
Wife, do you want a boy?

21
00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:07.566
Or do you like girls?

22
00:01:07.566 --> 00:01:10.400
Honey, I really miss you so much.

23
00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.200
Teacher and student Guoguo are still there

24
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.400
Guoguo is not there

25
00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.200
Guoguo can't hear
