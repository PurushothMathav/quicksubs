00:00:03.866 --> 00:00:05.500
What you want to show me

2
00:00:08.866 --> 00:00:09.666
Here it is.

3
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:17.100
If I let them know that I have this disease

4
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.166
The board will definitely kick me out

5
00:00:20.566 --> 00:00:22.300
Although nothing happened that night

6
00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.300
But if I let him know I went to someone else's room

7
00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.266
Will he think I'm dirty?

8
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.200
So that night

9
00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.100
I'm going to threaten you with this

10
00:00:31.366 --> 00:00:32.566
To be precise

11
00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.233
It was he who deliberately quoted our arm

12
00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:35.966
Take a video of this and keep it as evidence

13
00:00:39.933 --> 00:00:41.266
When did you see the doctor?

14
00:00:41.766 --> 00:00:43.066
During studying abroad

15
00:00:43.133 --> 00:00:44.900
They were extremely ill adapted.

16
00:00:45.866 --> 00:00:48.833
Back then, I was also determined to send Jiang Yu abroad

17
00:00:48.966 --> 00:00:50.833
Never asked his opinion

18
00:00:52.733 --> 00:00:54.233
How are you now?

19
00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:56.600
originally

20
00:00:56.766 --> 00:00:59.233
I don't want anyone to know about this.

21
00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:03.900
It doesn't matter.

22
00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:05.866
If it were me

23
00:01:06.066 --> 00:01:06.900
I don't want to either

24
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.033
Others see themselves at their worst

25
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.266
Jiang Yu used to be half of my family

26
00:01:14.266 --> 00:01:16.200
Should I believe him?

27
00:01:17.733 --> 00:01:19.100
Why are you asking me out?

28
00:01:20.266 --> 00:01:21.433
I know it all

29
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.266
What!

30
00:01:24.866 --> 00:01:26.400
You know it all

31
00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.200
Xiao Jiang took the initiative to tell you

32
00:01:31.566 --> 00:01:33.300
Then I have nothing to hide

33
00:01:33.766 --> 00:01:36.266
The paternity test is in my hands

34
00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:37.366
As long as I hold it

35
00:01:37.366 --> 00:01:40.033
His company always has a point for me

36
00:01:43.266 --> 00:01:44.166
Fight with me

37
00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:48.300
You're still too young.

38
00:01:51.066 --> 00:01:52.766
Paternity test
