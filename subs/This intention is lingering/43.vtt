00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.100
Take a look inside.

2
00:00:01.933 --> 00:00:04.466
I said it was destined for you

3
00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:06.800
I don't understand what you are gesturing

4
00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:08.600
My new company just went public

5
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:09.566
Very busy

6
00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:12.500
Unlike Aunt Wang Yu who is in debt

7
00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.066
And diligence and elegance

8
00:00:14.133 --> 00:00:15.233
Like teasing children

9
00:00:21.466 --> 00:00:23.466
My Guoguo is still alive

10
00:00:24.866 --> 00:00:27.633
But deaf and dumb

11
00:00:28.733 --> 00:00:31.366
What happened to my fruit?

12
00:00:32.366 --> 00:00:34.266
Blame mom

13
00:00:34.766 --> 00:00:37.000
I didn't find you earlier.

14
00:00:40.466 --> 00:00:41.666
I found Guoguo

15
00:00:41.666 --> 00:00:44.500
He is not dead, custody is in Wang Yu's hands

16
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.833
I want to take custody of Guoguo

17
00:00:49.533 --> 00:00:52.000
I support you in whatever you do.

18
00:00:53.366 --> 00:00:54.166
Jiang Yu

19
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.133
Let's split up.

20
00:00:56.133 --> 00:00:58.000
You have Wang Yu's blood on you

21
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.266
Guoguo doesn't want to see your Chen Lin

22
00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.566
What does Guoguo's life have to do with me?

23
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.200
What does it have to do with us?

24
00:01:06.766 --> 00:01:08.600
What does it have to do with us?

25
00:01:09.366 --> 00:01:11.366
He is the daughter of a temporary aunt

26
00:01:11.366 --> 00:01:13.266
Don't you want to rescue him?

27
00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.533
Temporarily dead

28
00:01:15.533 --> 00:01:17.500
What can his daughter do for him?

29
00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.000
And I think Guoguo

30
00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:21.233
He also really wants to go down and accompany the temporary?

31
00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.933
Jiang Yu, are you crazy?

32
00:01:23.933 --> 00:01:25.733
How can you say such a thing?

33
00:01:25.733 --> 00:01:27.300
What do you mean I won?

34
00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.866
When I found out about the temporary death

35
00:01:29.866 --> 00:01:31.600
I just want to go down and be with him

36
00:01:31.733 --> 00:01:33.800
But the thought of having Guoguo with him

37
00:01:34.266 --> 00:01:35.566
I just wanted to avenge him first

38
00:01:35.966 --> 00:01:38.833
I didn't expect Guoguo to be dead now

39
00:01:38.966 --> 00:01:41.500
Leave the temporary alone down there for so long

40
00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:43.500
you

41
00:01:44.566 --> 00:01:45.366
you

42
00:01:47.933 --> 00:01:48.800
Don't worry.

43
00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.566
My current thinking has not changed

44
00:01:50.566 --> 00:01:52.233
I will definitely avenge Guoguo

45
00:01:52.266 --> 00:01:54.600
Let's pay for your opportunity

46
00:01:54.966 --> 00:01:55.766
Chen Lin

47
00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:57.600
Don't because of Guoguo

48
00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.266
You think we really have a bad relationship?
