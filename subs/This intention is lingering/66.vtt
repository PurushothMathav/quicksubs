00:00:10.133 --> 00:00:11.266
Are you all right?

2
00:00:11.933 --> 00:00:15.033
I feel like something happened to your sister.

3
00:00:19.266 --> 00:00:20.066
Locator

4
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:25.300
Chen Lin is running around

5
00:00:26.166 --> 00:00:27.000
Jiang Yue

6
00:00:28.166 --> 00:00:29.966
We're still getting married.

7
00:00:31.466 --> 00:00:32.666
Mr. Xiao Jiang

8
00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.700
Just throw Xiaorou on the token and refuse to accept it

9
00:00:37.966 --> 00:00:41.100
Wang Yue, don't think I don't know you're up to something

10
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:41.800
I have put you

11
00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.000
All the evidence for the crime has been collected

12
00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:45.800
Ready to sit through the prison

13
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.100
You'd better take all your

14
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.700
Tell me everything you know

15
00:00:51.766 --> 00:00:53.233
Otherwise, when the time comes

16
00:00:53.366 --> 00:00:55.600
It's hard for me to guarantee that you won't be suspected

17
00:00:55.733 --> 00:00:58.566
Was Zheng Rou dumped by the groom in public?

18
00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:00.900
Sure enough, it's a complaint

19
00:01:15.733 --> 00:01:17.266
What are you doing?

20
00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.266
A man named Wang Yu asked me to take revenge on you

21
00:01:21.266 --> 00:01:22.766
And never be soft

22
00:01:22.766 --> 00:01:25.233
How do you think I should get revenge?

23
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.000
Someone's coming for me soon

24
00:01:28.166 --> 00:01:30.400
I advise you to stop as soon as possible

25
00:01:30.733 --> 00:01:32.533
In this wilderness

26
00:01:32.533 --> 00:01:34.066
I'll see who will save you.

27
00:01:36.533 --> 00:01:38.200
Don't you know yet?

28
00:01:38.566 --> 00:01:40.866
Wang Yu has been arrested

29
00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.800
If you turn yourself in now

30
00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.266
Maybe two less years

31
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.166
Really?

32
00:01:48.266 --> 00:01:51.833
Then I'll have a good time before I go to jail
