00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:01.066
Pardon me?

2
00:00:01.333 --> 00:00:04.033
Does Sister Xia want to change into a wedding dress for you?

3
00:00:05.933 --> 00:00:08.100
No need, change it.

4
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:09.200
I'll change it for her.

5
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:12.466
You just said

6
00:00:12.466 --> 00:00:14.533
You have already figured out how to deal with Wang Yu

7
00:00:14.533 --> 00:00:15.766
You should know

8
00:00:15.766 --> 00:00:18.000
The first person in Wang Yu's eyes is you

9
00:00:18.866 --> 00:00:21.666
And the person he cares about the most is you

10
00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:22.900
Exactly.

11
00:00:23.666 --> 00:00:24.900
If he knew

12
00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.900
I've lost all interest in you

13
00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:28.433
Also drove you out of the cheap

14
00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:31.200
I don't think he will target you.

15
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:32.800
It won't target Guoguo anymore

16
00:00:32.933 --> 00:00:33.800
You know

17
00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.100
I can't let Guoguo leave my side

18
00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.266
Don't worry, it won't always be like this.

19
00:00:38.266 --> 00:00:40.100
You just need to hide for a while

20
00:00:40.333 --> 00:00:42.666
Once I caught Wang Yu's Barbie

21
00:00:42.666 --> 00:00:45.200
You can go down with Guoguo

22
00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.000
Jiang Yu is right

23
00:00:48.266 --> 00:00:50.833
This is really the best way to go

24
00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.466
Can I give Guoguo to you with peace of mind?

25
00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.200
Isn't that what you said?

26
00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.100
We've always been on the side

27
00:01:05.066 --> 00:01:08.233
Miss Chen, have you slept in your wedding dress?
