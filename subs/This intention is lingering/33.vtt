00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.533
Jiang Yu, why did you bring me to the company?

2
00:00:02.533 --> 00:00:03.700
Didn't you promise me

3
00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:05.600
Tell me what happened that night?

4
00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.466
Tell me what you want is in the company.

5
00:00:08.466 --> 00:00:10.966
What are you talking about with me?

6
00:00:11.066 --> 00:00:12.233
So happy

7
00:00:15.133 --> 00:00:16.266
None of your business.

8
00:00:18.533 --> 00:00:19.500
Mr. Xiao Jiang

9
00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:22.566
Why didn't you go on a blind date last night?

10
00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:26.000
Mr. Jiang, you don't want others to know either

11
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.300
The mother-son relationship between me and you

12
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.233
Wang Yue, how dare you threaten me?

13
00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.266
Tonight at 8 o'clock at Pearl Restaurant

14
00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.600
Zheng Rou will be waiting for you there

15
00:00:37.766 --> 00:00:38.933
We are soft

16
00:00:38.933 --> 00:00:40.833
At least she's a famous lady

17
00:00:40.933 --> 00:00:43.600
Unlike a wild girl like Chen Lin

18
00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.433
I'm doing it for your own good too

19
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.866
It's not good for you to just let go of soft doves like that

20
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:50.566
Brother Jiang Yu

21
00:00:50.733 --> 00:00:54.066
I waited for you for a long time last night

22
00:00:55.466 --> 00:00:56.766
I have a girlfriend

23
00:00:56.766 --> 00:00:58.000
Don't worry about it.

24
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.166
Let's go, ignore these irrelevant people

25
00:01:02.533 --> 00:01:06.366
Xiao Jiang always remembers our promise

26
00:01:06.533 --> 00:01:08.766
What agreement?

27
00:01:08.766 --> 00:01:12.000
And how could Wang Yu arrange a blind date for Jiang Yu?

28
00:01:12.166 --> 00:01:16.000
The two of them have met so deeply in private

29
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:20.300
What are you doing?

30
00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.500
Since this lady is a famous lady

31
00:01:22.533 --> 00:01:25.733
Then you should know better than me what knowledge is

32
00:01:25.733 --> 00:01:27.033
third class three

33
00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.766
Chen Ling, let's see how long you can laugh
