00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:01.633
Who are you?

2
00:00:03.866 --> 00:00:05.500
Dare to come here to make trouble

3
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.466
Wang Yu, are you stupid?

4
00:00:07.466 --> 00:00:09.066
Don't you know what we're here for?

5
00:00:09.066 --> 00:00:10.900
We are looking for you to collect debts.

6
00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:13.066
Hurry up and pay back the money your company owes my client

7
00:00:13.066 --> 00:00:16.166
What do you owe you?

8
00:00:16.333 --> 00:00:18.166
Your company is now an empty shell.

9
00:00:18.166 --> 00:00:20.266
You don't know that you are in debt, do you?

10
00:00:20.266 --> 00:00:21.966
You're a shitty president

11
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.766
This gold looks good on you

12
00:00:26.766 --> 00:00:29.033
Scared dirty let me go

13
00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:30.800
I don't know anything.

14
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:31.800
What are you doing?

15
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.700
Someone is here, sorry Mr. Wang

16
00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:34.933
When will the salary be sent to us?

17
00:00:34.933 --> 00:00:36.566
When will you call us again?

18
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:38.300
you

19
00:00:39.133 --> 00:00:41.866
Mr. Wang, it seems that the rumors are true

20
00:00:41.966 --> 00:00:45.266
The Wang Group is now in deficit and debt

21
00:00:45.266 --> 00:00:47.600
It's a ticking time bomb.

22
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.766
Wang Yu doesn't know anything

23
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.500
So stupid

24
00:00:51.533 --> 00:00:53.966
No ability to run a company at all

25
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.800
Still smug here

26
00:00:58.933 --> 00:01:01.166
I don't want to say no more

27
00:01:01.166 --> 00:01:02.500
Shut up

28
00:01:05.466 --> 00:01:06.600
Oh, I see.

29
00:01:06.666 --> 00:01:07.833
It's you, right?

30
00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:10.066
It's you who gave me the next set

31
00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.700
That's right, it's me.

32
00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.133
What if I give you the company?

33
00:01:19.133 --> 00:01:22.533
I've already moved all the company's money

34
00:01:22.533 --> 00:01:25.366
Leaving this debt-laden ruin

35
00:01:25.466 --> 00:01:28.166
I just gave you this trash.

36
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.200
You bitch

37
00:01:32.966 --> 00:01:36.833
How about this?

38
00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.266
The taste of falling into the mud all at once

39
00:01:39.733 --> 00:01:41.366
It's hard to talk

40
00:01:43.133 --> 00:01:44.800
I'm going to kill you!

41
00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:46.033
Kill me!

42
00:01:46.066 --> 00:01:48.166
Do you think I'm still the Chen Lin you slaughtered?

43
00:01:48.166 --> 00:01:48.966
Oh?

44
00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:52.400
You bereaved dog with nothing

45
00:01:52.766 --> 00:01:55.300
Let's think about how to pay off the debt

46
00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:01.000
Hahahahahaha

47
00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:04.600
Mr. Wang remembers to pay back the money

48
00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:09.166
Come tomorrow night, hahaha.

49
00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.966
Look at Chen Yun's complacent appearance

50
00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.633
Why is such a small person getting wet?

51
00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:19.633
Is that you?

52
00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.000
Zhang Heng

53
00:02:29.166 --> 00:02:32.166
Bring me that little bastard born of a cheap hoof

54
00:02:32.166 --> 00:02:34.100
Come here ok
