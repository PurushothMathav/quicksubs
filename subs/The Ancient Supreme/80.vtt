00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:05.333
Yufan, your revenge has been avenged

2
00:00:05.333 --> 00:00:06.800
Nothing planned today

3
00:00:07.733 --> 00:00:10.300
I've lived most of my life in the primeval realm

4
00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:11.766
Missed too many risks

5
00:00:12.333 --> 00:00:13.966
I'm going to travel the world first

6
00:00:13.966 --> 00:00:15.666
After visiting the world?

7
00:00:15.766 --> 00:00:17.266
I will try to ascend

8
00:00:17.566 --> 00:00:18.866
Impact the saint realm

9
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:21.766
I'll go with you.

10
00:00:21.766 --> 00:00:24.266
It just so happens that I also want to see the scenery of the world

11
00:00:25.366 --> 00:00:26.166
Governor Qin

12
00:00:26.566 --> 00:00:27.866
You are not just a soldier

13
00:00:28.166 --> 00:00:29.433
Still a loyal and filial ancestor

14
00:00:29.766 --> 00:00:31.833
Loyal and filial people need you to take revenge

15
00:00:32.133 --> 00:00:34.300
How can you follow me and show up?

16
00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.033
You should be honest and treat the filial piety

17
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:38.466
I'm more laid-back

18
00:00:38.466 --> 00:00:40.066
I will accompany you to travel the world.

19
00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.700
Shen Qianyang, why don't you stay at home?

20
00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:44.800
Come out and join in the fun

21
00:00:45.333 --> 00:00:47.966
Qin Jing, what I want to do is none of your business

22
00:00:47.966 --> 00:00:49.800
Do I still have to report to you?

23
00:00:51.333 --> 00:00:54.900
Extraordinary things in the past are that I misunderstood you too much

24
00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.266
Can you give me another try?

25
00:00:57.266 --> 00:00:58.066
opportunity

26
00:00:59.166 --> 00:01:00.066
Shen Qianyao

27
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.533
Didn't you say that you would only be friends with Feifan?

28
00:01:02.533 --> 00:01:04.266
How can you go back on your word?

29
00:01:04.333 --> 00:01:06.500
What do you care what I do?

30
00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:09.100
Bevan

31
00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.500
Can you give me another chance to pursue it again?

32
00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.866
Bevan, you can't promise him

33
00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:17.600
We are the significant other

34
00:01:17.866 --> 00:01:19.133
Jingjing, don't rob me

35
00:01:19.133 --> 00:01:21.266
Extraordinary, don't rob me

36
00:01:21.266 --> 00:01:22.600
Extraordinary is mine

37
00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.066
What is yours, you let go

38
00:01:25.066 --> 00:01:27.966
You let go that's me in this situation

39
00:01:27.966 --> 00:01:30.600
How should you choose?
