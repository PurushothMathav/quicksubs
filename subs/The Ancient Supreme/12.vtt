1
00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.500
A little governor

2
00:00:01.766 --> 00:00:02.600
Not rare

3
00:00:02.766 --> 00:00:05.200
The Governor is giving you face when he talks to you

4
00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.066
It's good that you dare to contradict you

5
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.500
You are impatient

6
00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:09.966
I offended Governor Qin

7
00:00:09.966 --> 00:00:11.600
You will die.

8
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:12.833
When you die

9
00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.300
Mr. Qin, ask him

10
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:18.500
Does he dare to touch me?

11
00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.400
You bastard dare to be unfortunate to your ex-ancestors

12
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.766
I have to ask you to teach you a good lesson today

13
00:00:26.733 --> 00:00:27.666
Zhang Shaoxing

14
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.533
How dare you make trouble at my Ming Emperor banquet

15
00:00:30.533 --> 00:00:32.566
Who gave your dog the guts to make trouble first?

16
00:00:32.566 --> 00:00:33.533
Obviously this trash

17
00:00:33.533 --> 00:00:35.100
You are teaching me to do things

18
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.300
Can always arrange a team

19
00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:38.100
The little one is wrong.

20
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.366
The younger brother is willing to sacrifice the righteous treasure after the death of the poor

21
00:00:40.366 --> 00:00:42.833
Please spare my life

22
00:00:42.966 --> 00:00:44.766
You have the righteous treasure on the poor

23
00:00:44.766 --> 00:00:47.666
That's right, the villain paid a lot of money to find it.

24
00:00:47.666 --> 00:00:49.366
Zhang Shao is still amazing

25
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.500
You can get a treasure from the poor house

26
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:52.966
Unlike some people

27
00:00:52.966 --> 00:00:56.466
Holding glass beads as the inner alchemy of latex art

28
00:00:56.466 --> 00:00:58.733
I just want to marry my daughter

29
00:00:58.733 --> 00:00:59.700
So filial

30
00:01:00.133 --> 00:01:02.966
Adults are poor for their strange mouths

31
00:01:02.966 --> 00:01:05.300
It may be a rare good thing

32
00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.500
Otherwise, let's put it here today

33
00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:09.433
It's okay, I never hit you
