1
00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:02.200
This is my lucky tripod

2
00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:03.966
How to trespass in the world

3
00:00:04.533 --> 00:00:07.166
Ye Feifan, this is obviously the Fuding of Qin headquarters

4
00:00:07.166 --> 00:00:08.400
How did it become yours?

5
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:09.800
I said this is Shallow Dragon Fuding

6
00:00:10.066 --> 00:00:11.500
It was given to me by the situation.

7
00:00:11.666 --> 00:00:12.866
And do you believe that?

8
00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.266
Hahaha Ye Feifan

9
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:17.133
Do you take us for fools?

10
00:00:17.133 --> 00:00:19.966
This is the most luxurious villa ever planted

11
00:00:20.466 --> 00:00:23.233
Are you a gate watcher here?

12
00:00:23.333 --> 00:00:24.733
Besides, money?

13
00:00:24.733 --> 00:00:25.100
Governor

14
00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:26.933
How can it be possible to put a villa worth billions

15
00:00:26.933 --> 00:00:29.466
I'll give you this little white face.

16
00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:32.466
Ye Feifan, can you be more reliable?

17
00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:35.133
Why can you even tell such a lie now?

18
00:00:35.133 --> 00:00:36.300
Get out of here

19
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.500
If you let the governor know that you are good at his blessing cauldron

20
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:39.900
No one can save me then

21
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.033
Ye Feifan doesn't need anyone to save him

22
00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.666
Can you see yourself clearly?

23
00:00:46.666 --> 00:00:49.033
You're just a gate watcher

24
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.966
You can deceive your ancestors with rhetoric

25
00:00:51.966 --> 00:00:53.866
Can you still deceive him for the rest of your life?

26
00:00:53.866 --> 00:00:55.966
My father was really blind back then

27
00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.900
How could it be for a trash like you?

28
00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:59.466
And lost his life in vain

29
00:01:01.133 --> 00:01:03.000
Extraordinary you see

30
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.066
It is impossible to buy ten gates in ten lifetimes

31
00:01:05.066 --> 00:01:06.400
A door at the bottom of Qianlong Valley

32
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.366
A lot of people sent it to me

33
00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:09.600
Why should I do it myself?

34
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.733
You really think of yourself as smart

35
00:01:11.733 --> 00:01:13.733
You just have one peeking at the door

36
00:01:13.733 --> 00:01:15.400
How could it be possible to send a villa?

37
00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:16.466
I advise you.

38
00:01:16.466 --> 00:01:19.466
Why don't you stop daydreaming here?

39
00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.466
Get out of here!

40
00:01:22.466 --> 00:01:23.966
I never want to see you again.
