00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:03.033
Ye Feifan, what are you wearing?

2
00:00:03.133 --> 00:00:04.466
Under the World

3
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:05.966
Could it be the king's land?

4
00:00:06.133 --> 00:00:08.766
Do you want to fight against the king's law?

5
00:00:09.533 --> 00:00:12.300
Sheriff Hill must kill him

6
00:00:12.366 --> 00:00:14.300
Do us justice?

7
00:00:14.566 --> 00:00:15.366
Ye Heifan

8
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.966
Since you don't want to be obediently captured

9
00:00:19.666 --> 00:00:22.900
Then I can only send you on your way.

10
00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.966
You're the only one to die

11
00:00:26.966 --> 00:00:27.700
Ares

12
00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:30.700
Killing you is as simple as crushing an ant

13
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.400
Just be honest and capture it

14
00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:34.233
waste

15
00:00:35.133 --> 00:00:38.766
God of Police, please save his life

16
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.366
Clues about the Tai Chi diagram

17
00:00:42.066 --> 00:00:45.000
I'm going to press him

18
00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:49.200
up

19
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.000
dare to resist

20
00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:53.966
Break limbs

21
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.100
Who dares to move?

22
00:01:01.733 --> 00:01:02.533
Police Qin

23
00:01:03.666 --> 00:01:05.000
What are you doing here?

24
00:01:05.966 --> 00:01:07.266
Yes, I am.

25
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.233
Whoever moves him will die

26
00:01:10.933 --> 00:01:12.500
What a troublemaker

27
00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:13.866
When did you get into trouble?

28
00:01:13.866 --> 00:01:15.700
It's not that Mr. Qin rushed over to show you

29
00:01:15.966 --> 00:01:17.000
lost

30
00:01:17.666 --> 00:01:18.466
Police Qin

31
00:01:19.366 --> 00:01:22.100
I advise you to stay out of your business

32
00:01:22.466 --> 00:01:25.366
Otherwise, I'll go with you

33
00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.466
Jinglong, how dare you?

34
00:01:29.766 --> 00:01:31.633
I am the governor of the lower middle class

35
00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.466
How dare you touch me?

36
00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:34.300
Governor

37
00:01:35.066 --> 00:01:37.400
You don't seem to have officially taken office yet, do you?

38
00:01:37.666 --> 00:01:40.266
It's easy to kill you

39
00:01:41.133 --> 00:01:42.433
I'm here today.

40
00:01:42.666 --> 00:01:44.266
No one wants to hurt him

41
00:01:44.266 --> 00:01:48.066
Then let's see if you have the ability.
