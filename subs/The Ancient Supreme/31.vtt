00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:01.433
I'll give you three seconds.

2
00:00:01.666 --> 00:00:03.800
If you don't say it, he will die

3
00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:07.133
Boy, what's up, you rush over

4
00:00:07.133 --> 00:00:08.233
You let my son go

5
00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:10.066
Dad 3

6
00:00:10.266 --> 00:00:11.366
Dad save me

7
00:00:11.366 --> 00:00:13.366

You let my son go

10
00:00:26.366 --> 00:00:27.300
that year

11
00:00:28.766 --> 00:00:32.033
There was also Lord Kowloon who was involved in that matter

12
00:00:38.766 --> 00:00:41.400
King Dashen, do you have to call the shots for us?

13
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.666
Jing Dashen is this trash

14
00:00:43.766 --> 00:00:45.266
He not only broke into the house

15
00:00:45.266 --> 00:00:46.833
He also killed Master Huang

16
00:00:47.133 --> 00:00:49.633
You must let him go today

17
00:00:49.766 --> 00:00:50.566
Li Long

18
00:00:51.133 --> 00:00:54.200
Are you sure you want to take care of this today?

19
00:00:54.766 --> 00:00:55.566
Ye Fei Tan

20
00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.800
You broke into the house

21
00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:59.433
Abuse of lynching

22
00:00:59.466 --> 00:01:00.866
Defy the king's law

23
00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.100
No one can break it today

24
00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.100
Police god, you must beat him up, ghost criminal

25
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.433
Is there justice for the common people?

26
00:01:09.466 --> 00:01:12.100
Ye Feifan obediently gave up and captured

27
00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:13.866
Wait for me

28
00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:15.400
You are dead

29
00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:16.800
If you want to do it

30
00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.266
Just come and try

31
00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:19.933
I invited you today.

32
00:01:19.933 --> 00:01:21.200
Just for revenge

33
00:01:21.366 --> 00:01:22.900
God Block Killer

34
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.166
I didn't do the Buddhist killing method either.

35
00:01:25.666 --> 00:01:27.966
Do you still have the law in your eyes?

36
00:01:28.066 --> 00:01:29.966
If you act recklessly again

37
00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:32.433
Don't blame me for being rude to you.

38
00:01:32.733 --> 00:01:34.033
Wang law

39
00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.400
He can't control me
