00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.000
Mr. Kim won't let you go

2
00:00:02.566 --> 00:00:04.466
Mean that Mean

3
00:00:04.566 --> 00:00:06.033
You can't give me anything

4
00:00:06.266 --> 00:00:10.300
Where is he? I came to avenge my dad this time

5
00:00:10.666 --> 00:00:12.266
Tell me where he is

6
00:00:12.733 --> 00:00:13.800
How do I know?

7
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:15.033
I don't know.

8
00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:17.800
Since you don't know

9
00:00:17.933 --> 00:00:19.666
I'll take you upstairs first

10
00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:22.866
Not here today

11
00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.400
Boy, you said that bitch wasn't here

12
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:28.733
He's no longer here.

13
00:00:28.733 --> 00:00:30.866
You let me leave it there

14
00:00:30.866 --> 00:00:32.900
Where do I put my face?

15
00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:34.600
I just finished that sentence

16
00:00:34.766 --> 00:00:36.666
Leave now before I get angry

17
00:00:36.966 --> 00:00:37.966
Miss the end

18
00:00:39.066 --> 00:00:40.466
What is a king?

19
00:00:40.466 --> 00:00:41.600
How dare you threaten me?

20
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.366
Ye Yifan, shut up your father

21
00:00:43.366 --> 00:00:45.266
Don't take us, boy

22
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.633
Hahaha big brother

23
00:00:47.766 --> 00:00:49.366
Can you give me a dog's life?

24
00:00:49.466 --> 00:00:50.566
As long as you don't kill me

25
00:00:50.566 --> 00:00:52.600
I can give you as much as you want.

26
00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.300
How about more money?

27
00:00:56.066 --> 00:00:59.300
I'm not short of money unless

28
00:01:06.366 --> 00:01:09.700
So familiar, big brother, if you like it, just take it away.

29
00:01:10.333 --> 00:01:11.566
Pardon me?

30
00:01:11.566 --> 00:01:13.033
You are very sensible

31
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.233
Little beauty

32
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.666
As long as you stay with me for one night

33
00:01:16.966 --> 00:01:18.366
I'm normal oops

34
00:01:18.533 --> 00:01:19.800
Don't come here

35
00:01:20.466 --> 00:01:22.700
Tian Yao, don't you want to resist?

36
00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.066
Are you just a big pot?

37
00:01:24.066 --> 00:01:28.366
In this way, we can all be saved. You can make the young army shameless.

38
00:01:28.366 --> 00:01:30.600
I was killed by our teacher, okay?

39
00:01:31.366 --> 00:01:32.166
Chen Yao

40
00:01:32.466 --> 00:01:34.166
Are you doing this for me?

41
00:01:34.166 --> 00:01:36.300
Just play with this big brother once

42
00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.566
Wait until I play a few times

43
00:01:38.733 --> 00:01:40.266
Big brother uh

44
00:01:40.266 --> 00:01:41.366
After he gives it to you

45
00:01:41.733 --> 00:01:42.800
Don't die

46
00:01:43.133 --> 00:01:45.266
For something so sensible of you

47
00:01:45.366 --> 00:01:46.933
Be honest

48
00:01:46.933 --> 00:01:49.066
Wait until we're done playing

49
00:01:50.766 --> 00:01:55.366
Hahahahaha

50
00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:01.900
How dare you hit me?
