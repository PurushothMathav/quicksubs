00:00:03.966 --> 00:00:06.733
Did you call Summer?

2
00:00:06.733 --> 00:00:07.733
He can't come back

3
00:00:07.733 --> 00:00:11.500
Can't get through, don't know where he went to play

4
00:00:11.533 --> 00:00:14.633
He'll come back when he's done playing

5
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.966
Besides, outside

6
00:00:16.966 --> 00:00:20.066
There are a few who are as sincere as we are to him

7
00:00:20.066 --> 00:00:20.866
OK

8
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.433
Yeah, maybe he's guilty

9
00:00:24.466 --> 00:00:26.433
But if he doesn't come back today

10
00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:30.200
Tell him not to come back to this house in the future.

11
00:00:33.866 --> 00:00:36.200
I couldn't figure it out before

12
00:00:36.266 --> 00:00:39.633
Why don't my parents love me?

13
00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.633
Why did you let me stay at my uncle's house all the time?

14
00:00:43.933 --> 00:00:47.566
My mother used to love me very much

15
00:00:48.133 --> 00:00:49.666
Oh, right.

16
00:00:50.666 --> 00:00:52.100
He wants a younger brother

17
00:00:53.866 --> 00:00:56.866
Cheng Ziqing stole something, I memorized it

18
00:00:58.266 --> 00:01:00.100
My mom lost her baby.

19
00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:01.833
I memorized

20
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.233
My uncle entered my room in the dark and forced me to pick up guests

21
00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:07.833
I want to give too

22
00:01:08.266 --> 00:01:10.066
Because I dare not offend them.

23
00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.433
You might ask

24
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.300
Why didn't I tell my parents?

25
00:01:16.566 --> 00:01:18.400
I actually told my dad

26
00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:19.633
Dad said

27
00:01:20.766 --> 00:01:22.433
It's all family

28
00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.266
If your mother knew

29
00:01:25.266 --> 00:01:27.100
What your uncle did to you

30
00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:29.233
He's going crazy

31
00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.566
Brother, I just made it for you.

32
00:01:31.566 --> 00:01:34.533
Cheng Ziqing followed her mother's love for him

33
00:01:34.533 --> 00:01:36.900
Bullying me at school

34
00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.966
The bully was when I was 18

35
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.166
He also asked Liu Yao

36
00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.600
Dragged me into the alley

37
00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.900
Saved me I want to report the case

38
00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:47.600
At this time

39
00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.166
And here I was.

40
00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.266
I thought he was never like that.

41
00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:55.966
Stand up for me once

42
00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.900
I've darkened it.

43
00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.366
This is so embarrassing.

44
00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.500
I can't accept a daughter who's been raped.

45
00:02:06.366 --> 00:02:07.300
even

46
00:02:07.866 --> 00:02:09.766
And he asked me to marry him.

47
00:02:09.966 --> 00:02:11.366
Marry him a little padded jacket

48
00:02:12.166 --> 00:02:13.833
Come and sit at home today

49
00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:14.966
My aunt?

50
00:02:14.966 --> 00:02:18.400
You have so much ability, haha, don't mind?

51
00:02:20.533 --> 00:02:22.100
This is my dad.

52
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.400
Is that what you said?

53
00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:31.000
Is it all real him?

54
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.966
He killed my parents, both of them candy caps

55
00:02:33.966 --> 00:02:36.633
And aunt, didn't you say it too?

56
00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.166
Hypocritical people don't deserve to live in this world

57
00:02:40.466 --> 00:02:41.800
You don't love me anymore, get out of here

58
00:02:42.133 --> 00:02:44.166
You stand here and get out

59
00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.266
You are the father

60
00:02:47.766 --> 00:02:49.200
How can you be like this

61
00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.500
This kind of thing

62
00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.233
What do you want me to do?

63
00:02:52.266 --> 00:02:53.400
He's your brother.

64
00:02:53.533 --> 00:02:55.500
I'm thinking of you too

65
00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.200
I asked him to marry Liu Yao

66
00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.400
Aren't you satisfied too?

67
00:02:59.466 --> 00:03:02.700
Little girl, your father is a loser

68
00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.700
You have the ability and you want face

69
00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.566
What are you doing with this kind of trash?

70
00:03:07.566 --> 00:03:09.966
Makeup girl, what would you do?

71
00:03:09.966 --> 00:03:14.000
Did you capture your brother or kill the man who raped Summer?
