00:00:00.533 --> 00:00:03.866
Mom's New Year's Eve

2
00:00:05.466 --> 00:00:07.566
You can see my body

3
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.000
And you know what?

4
00:00:11.466 --> 00:00:15.066
When I knew I was a late crow

5
00:00:15.966 --> 00:00:17.366
I'm so happy.

6
00:00:17.366 --> 00:00:22.066
I can finally leave this world, mom

7
00:00:23.333 --> 00:00:24.600
Sorry.

8
00:00:25.766 --> 00:00:27.233
I didn't make it.

9
00:00:27.733 --> 00:00:29.666
What you expect

10
00:00:30.666 --> 00:00:32.100
You may not understand

11
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.300
Why am I doing this?

12
00:00:35.366 --> 00:00:37.400
I'm not trying to get revenge on anyone

13
00:00:37.766 --> 00:00:39.366
I want you to know.

14
00:00:39.466 --> 00:00:41.833
Your daughter is actually not that bad.

15
00:00:42.366 --> 00:00:44.300
I have been a left-behind child for 4 years

16
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.433
I read some books.

17
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.633
I haven't met many people

18
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.366
I haven't traveled.

19
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.666
I didn't even get a break.

20
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.966
So...

21
00:00:57.666 --> 00:00:59.166
I took my organs

22
00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.066
All donated

23
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.566
I took the money for my exact organ 400,000

24
00:01:07.166 --> 00:01:08.300
Now.

25
00:01:10.966 --> 00:01:13.433
My money and my mask

26
00:01:14.166 --> 00:01:15.400
All returned

27
00:01:16.333 --> 00:01:18.433
We can finally pay it back in two installments.

28
00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:22.600
I can even think of

29
00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.233
I was lying in the morgue.

30
00:01:26.266 --> 00:01:31.000
They clean every inch of my body

31
00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:34.500
i

32
00:01:35.166 --> 00:01:36.833
Dirty for 25 years

33
00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.166
Finally

34
00:01:40.066 --> 00:01:42.266
Clean and dead

35
00:01:48.166 --> 00:01:49.266
What do you want?

36
00:01:49.266 --> 00:01:52.166
Don't touch me. I'm going to find my daughter

37
00:01:52.266 --> 00:01:53.700
She was flying around with me.

38
00:01:53.733 --> 00:01:55.533
I'm going to save her.

39
00:01:55.533 --> 00:01:57.100
Save what?

40
00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:58.666
She's already dead.

41
00:01:58.666 --> 00:02:01.666
Didn't we see her body on New Year's Eve?

42
00:02:01.733 --> 00:02:03.300
No no

43
00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.033
You see he sent me a video

44
00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:07.733
That person is not him

45
00:02:07.733 --> 00:02:10.100
The top and bottom don't look like that.

46
00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:12.266
This video was already recorded

47
00:02:12.266 --> 00:02:13.366
regular sale

48
00:02:13.533 --> 00:02:15.200
He was a dead man.

49
00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:16.100
and

50
00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.800
People with advanced stomach cancer can't eat anything

51
00:02:20.066 --> 00:02:23.566
Do you remember what summer was like tonight?

52
00:02:23.766 --> 00:02:26.166
Ah of course I remember

53
00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.033
It's mom's little baby

54
00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.100
The mind is too young

55
00:02:50.066 --> 00:02:52.166
Can't see clearly

56
00:03:03.566 --> 00:03:05.666
Why don't I believe you?

57
00:03:09.533 --> 00:03:11.100
The body has been taken away

58
00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:12.266
Who took it?

59
00:03:12.266 --> 00:03:13.166
No we agree

60
00:03:13.166 --> 00:03:15.366
Who can take my daughter away?

61
00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:16.933
Taken away by a young man

62
00:03:16.933 --> 00:03:19.033
Besides, the other day you said it wasn't your daughter

63
00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:20.700
You don't even know your own daughter

64
00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.166
How did you become parents?

65
00:03:22.566 --> 00:03:24.666
My daughter has terminal stomach cancer.

66
00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:27.766
She was so frustrated that we didn't recognize the heroine.

67
00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:29.166
Who said it was stomach cancer?

68
00:03:29.166 --> 00:03:30.500
She was dying of pain.

69
00:03:30.766 --> 00:03:32.400
He was still alive when he went to the hospital.

70
00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.033
She didn't get any anesthesia.

71
00:03:34.133 --> 00:03:35.700
Direct living donation

72
00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:37.666
You have to think about how painful that is.

73
00:03:42.533 --> 00:03:44.700
I don't know.
