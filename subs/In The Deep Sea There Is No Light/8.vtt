1
00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.500
You owe me 6,000 bucks

2
00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:02.666
When are we leaving?

3
00:00:10.366 --> 00:00:11.966
Mom answers the phone

4
00:00:12.066 --> 00:00:13.600
Please answer the phone

5
00:00:15.333 --> 00:00:17.766
My cousin and aunt are playing mahjong now

6
00:00:18.666 --> 00:00:20.700
Ziqiang, I was followed

7
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:22.200
Can you ask my dad to pick me up?

8
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.800
Is it a man in black?

9
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.100
How did you know it was me?

10
00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:29.500
A thousand dollars is over for you next day

11
00:00:29.966 --> 00:00:31.366
You killed my parents

12
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.233
It's fair that I let people play with you.

13
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.266
Anyway, you've already been played

14
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:38.300
You called

15
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.600
Said he was going to stay with a male classmate tonight

16
00:00:40.966 --> 00:00:43.133
He knew I hated it when he went to your house

17
00:00:43.133 --> 00:00:44.366
Where did you live?

18
00:00:44.366 --> 00:00:45.466
You are not right

19
00:00:46.066 --> 00:00:48.100
Is this not a classic thing for you in the future?

20
00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.400
Stay away from him. Dirty

21
00:01:01.766 --> 00:01:02.800
Played with since childhood

22
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.700
Why are you still killing me for 1,000 yuan like a dead fish?

23
00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.900
I have dismissed the case

24
00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.000
This is so embarrassing.

25
00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.200
I can't accept a daughter who's been raped.

26
00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.500
Your mother is very emotional

27
00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.600
If he knew it was Qin Qin who did it

28
00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.233
He's going crazy

29
00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.866
Your uncle's death hit him too hard

30
00:01:29.866 --> 00:01:31.966
You can't hurt him anymore.

31
00:01:31.966 --> 00:01:33.200
What about me?

32
00:01:34.366 --> 00:01:36.000
What should I do?

33
00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.533
You won't let me tell you why my uncle died

34
00:01:38.533 --> 00:01:41.033
Cheng Ziqing asked someone to rape me, but you didn't let me say

35
00:01:41.266 --> 00:01:44.433
Dad, do you really love me?

36
00:01:45.666 --> 00:01:47.266
I am really your daughter

37
00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:52.366
Summer you you have been raped

38
00:01:52.366 --> 00:01:55.266
Even if you saved him and did it to you

39
00:01:55.266 --> 00:01:56.966
He's already dead.

40
00:01:57.066 --> 00:01:58.600
What else can you do?

41
00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.300
Don't be so selfish in summer

42
00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.933
Don't cause us any more trouble.

43
00:02:03.933 --> 00:02:05.400
Besides you

44
00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.466
You are not clean either

45
00:02:11.566 --> 00:02:14.766
Cousin, how could it be you when you see me?

46
00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.400
Mom, she's so far apart

47
00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.166
What kind of disease do you have?

48
00:02:21.166 --> 00:02:23.566
So dirty, who knows what disease he has

49
00:02:23.566 --> 00:02:26.333
Don't be too strict, don't be infected by him back then

50
00:02:26.333 --> 00:02:28.066
Auntie wants to give you a gift.

51
00:02:28.066 --> 00:02:29.366
What's your little one?

52
00:02:29.366 --> 00:02:30.766
Today light brings etiquette

53
00:02:30.766 --> 00:02:31.766
Thank you, Aunty.

54
00:02:45.133 --> 00:02:46.066
Mom?

55
00:02:49.533 --> 00:02:51.066
If I die

56
00:02:51.533 --> 00:02:53.300
Will you regret it?

57
00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.966
Leave it to me
