00:00:02.533 --> 00:00:05.533
Summer, you were fine the other day.

2
00:00:05.533 --> 00:00:06.733
How did you leave the hospital within a few days?

3
00:00:06.733 --> 00:00:08.333
The body is so weak

4
00:00:08.333 --> 00:00:11.300
Kidney surgery on a body like yours will kill you

5
00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:14.433
Dr. Chan

6
00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:16.733
My body is fine.

7
00:00:16.733 --> 00:00:17.666
I can hold on.

8
00:00:17.666 --> 00:00:18.866
I really need this money

9
00:00:18.866 --> 00:00:20.233
You're looking for death.

10
00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:22.700
Well, I'll let them know.

11
00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.633
Donate in half a month.

12
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.100
Thank you, Dr. Chen.

13
00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:33.400
I just need 400,000 money

14
00:00:41.566 --> 00:00:43.933
Summer is almost up

15
00:00:43.933 --> 00:00:47.900
What time is it? You're getting lazy, but Coco

16
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.300
The house is full of bacteria.

17
00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:53.700
I don't know how to open windows for ventilation

18
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:57.100
Or are you just doing it yourself?

19
00:00:57.133 --> 00:00:59.933
You are no longer a child in summer

20
00:00:59.933 --> 00:01:01.733
Go to the doctor if you are sick

21
00:01:01.733 --> 00:01:02.966
Don't pretend here

22
00:01:03.266 --> 00:01:07.200
I'm up, please have brought Xiao Liu here.

23
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.533
How can people see you so sloppy?

24
00:01:10.533 --> 00:01:13.300
Let you get up and pack yourself first

25
00:01:13.366 --> 00:01:15.433
Clean up this room again

26
00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:19.200
Dad?

27
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.300
You actually know why you played yesterday, right?

28
00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:24.766
You clearly know that he made a life for me back then

29
00:01:24.766 --> 00:01:25.933
Why is this still happening?

30
00:01:25.933 --> 00:01:28.733
You slept with him in the summer

31
00:01:28.733 --> 00:01:30.066
What's wrong with marrying him?

32
00:01:30.066 --> 00:01:31.500
Have you ever thought about it?

33
00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.766
If he talks about it

34
00:01:33.766 --> 00:01:36.300
How can we behave in our family?

35
00:01:36.866 --> 00:01:38.133
So I deserve it all, right?

36
00:01:38.133 --> 00:01:40.466
If you don't want this house to become a bad cop

37
00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:41.866
Better get out now

38
00:01:41.866 --> 00:01:43.033
Clean the door

39
00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:44.466
Now go out and let's sleep

40
00:01:45.666 --> 00:01:48.300
Hey, hey, sleep, sleep.

41
00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:49.866
You sleep all day.

42
00:01:49.866 --> 00:01:51.600
Was it a pig in a previous life?

43
00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.066
Don't want to see don't want to see

44
00:01:53.066 --> 00:01:55.066
You roll up and hide outside for a few days

45
00:01:55.066 --> 00:01:58.366
Come back when your mom is angry

46
00:02:06.866 --> 00:02:08.333
Mom, I'm going out for two days

47
00:02:08.333 --> 00:02:09.133
Come back in two days

48
00:02:09.133 --> 00:02:11.466
Don't think I don't know what you're thinking.

49
00:02:11.466 --> 00:02:13.266
If you don't get along well with Xiao Liu

50
00:02:13.266 --> 00:02:15.466
Don't come back to my house in the future

51
00:02:15.466 --> 00:02:18.666
And give me this 400,000 before you go

52
00:02:18.666 --> 00:02:22.066
Otherwise you never want to leave this house

53
00:02:27.866 --> 00:02:30.400
Hey, this card has 400,000

54
00:02:31.133 --> 00:02:31.966
Now are we

55
00:02:31.966 --> 00:02:34.400
If you have money, you 400,000 buy it

56
00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:35.900
Won't you sell it again?

57
00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:37.900
Please introduce the object to you well.

58
00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:39.866
Why are you so cheap?

59
00:02:40.333 --> 00:02:43.166
I went to buy and sell the kidney again.

60
00:02:44.533 --> 00:02:45.766
Others rest

61
00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.400
I work for money.

62
00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:48.500
Let me owe you a thousand

63
00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:49.300
uncle

64
00:02:49.466 --> 00:02:51.000
Not a single break

65
00:02:51.533 --> 00:02:51.700
i

66
00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.000
Never went out for a meal with a friend

67
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.233
Because I'm afraid

68
00:02:55.333 --> 00:02:57.666
I'm afraid others will find out the secret of my depression

69
00:02:57.666 --> 00:03:00.466
And I eat dog food like a dog sniffing a gasping cat

70
00:03:00.966 --> 00:03:02.500
There must be something ideal

71
00:03:02.566 --> 00:03:04.366
The happiness and pain of others

72
00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:06.466
You save me money.

73
00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.100
Money is not less than a penny

74
00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:10.866
You think the house is worth 20 million

75
00:03:10.866 --> 00:03:11.800
I'll tell you what.

76
00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.200
Your life is still given by me

77
00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.000
Good mom I promise you

78
00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:21.233
I will give you this life back
