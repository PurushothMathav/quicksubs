1
00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:01.400
Almost dead

2
00:00:03.666 --> 00:00:05.800
Then why aren't you dead yet?

3
00:00:05.866 --> 00:00:07.466
You've been lying since you were a kid

4
00:00:07.466 --> 00:00:09.366
I don't believe you at all.

5
00:00:09.366 --> 00:00:11.433
New Year's Eve is really a problem.

6
00:00:11.466 --> 00:00:13.500
If you don't want me to live for several years

7
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.033
Then you must go?

8
00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:17.100
It's really dirty, Lao Xia

9
00:00:17.666 --> 00:00:19.666
Come on. Let's go to the restaurant

10
00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.133
Can't you not make your mother angry in summer?

11
00:00:23.133 --> 00:00:24.600
Before we come back

12
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.466
Clean up the table and throw it away.

13
00:00:41.666 --> 00:00:42.466
Dad?

14
00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:44.100
Mom

15
00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:45.866
eat

16
00:00:53.766 --> 00:00:55.633
Why don't you love me anymore?

17
00:00:56.133 --> 00:00:57.800
I'd rather be left

18
00:00:58.166 --> 00:01:00.466
Why can't you love me?

19
00:01:09.466 --> 00:01:10.266
That's okay.

20
00:01:16.166 --> 00:01:18.066
I'm going back to China after the Chinese New Year.

21
00:01:18.066 --> 00:01:20.066
I won't leave this time when I return to China.

22
00:01:27.766 --> 00:01:28.200
child

23
00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.266
You misplaced the money and wronged the money yourself, right?

24
00:01:31.266 --> 00:01:33.933
The family could have had a good meal

25
00:01:33.933 --> 00:01:36.200
You should also accept your blessings

26
00:01:36.766 --> 00:01:38.133
I didn't mean to wrong him

27
00:01:38.133 --> 00:01:39.733
Why wouldn't I wrong someone?

28
00:01:39.733 --> 00:01:40.600
Isn't he growing up?

29
00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.333
Just do those sneaky things

30
00:01:42.333 --> 00:01:43.300
Again

31
00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:45.300
I don't want to have a good meal with him

32
00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:47.033
But look at his dead virtue

33
00:01:48.933 --> 00:01:50.266
Ok ok husband

34
00:01:50.266 --> 00:01:52.366
We won't be angry when we find the money.

35
00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:53.700
Where's the money for us?

36
00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.666
Return to Qin County to buy a house

37
00:01:55.666 --> 00:01:57.466
Isn't he and Xiao Chen getting married?

38
00:01:57.466 --> 00:01:59.433
Let's give him a guarantee after marriage

39
00:01:59.533 --> 00:02:00.900
Surprise him

40
00:02:02.766 --> 00:02:03.566
Ah!

41
00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.200
Didn't you say you have no money?

42
00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:10.033
I need money for surgery, I care about your facial features

43
00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.766
You said I was cheating you out of money. Why?

44
00:02:13.133 --> 00:02:15.100
I bought this one for the whole city

45
00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:16.800
My Money

46
00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.166
I won't give it to someone who killed his uncle

47
00:02:19.166 --> 00:02:21.666
If you kill a good gold, you also deserve two certificates with sunny days.

48
00:02:21.666 --> 00:02:23.366
Look at what you are

49
00:02:23.366 --> 00:02:24.433
You want money?

50
00:02:25.066 --> 00:02:26.133
Then you go steal it?

51
00:02:26.133 --> 00:02:27.566
Aren't you so good at stealing?

52
00:02:27.566 --> 00:02:29.266
Don't you have so many men?

53
00:02:29.266 --> 00:02:31.200
Are you looking for those men to take medicine?

54
00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.533
I see.

55
00:02:33.533 --> 00:02:34.966
Before you use it

56
00:02:34.966 --> 00:02:38.500
The guy who will only stick to men

57
00:02:41.766 --> 00:02:42.866
Hey, here you are.

58
00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.200
Cousin, long time no see?

59
00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.633
When will the $1,000 you owe me be paid off?
