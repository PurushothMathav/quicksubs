00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.400
Where's the bank card I put on the pillow? Take it out

2
00:00:09.666 --> 00:00:13.566
I didn't steal it. Why did you lose your money? Find me.

3
00:00:13.566 --> 00:00:15.300
Are you still stubborn?

4
00:00:15.366 --> 00:00:17.200
When you were a child, you stole from your uncle's house

5
00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:18.933
When you grow up, you steal at school

6
00:00:18.933 --> 00:00:20.866
Now you've come home to steal again

7
00:00:20.866 --> 00:00:22.400
You are not who are you?

8
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:23.100
I see you.

9
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.000
You've been a fantasy since you were a kid

10
00:00:26.466 --> 00:00:28.466
In summer, I know that your hands and feet are usually not clean.

11
00:00:28.466 --> 00:00:30.466
But I didn't expect you to even delay the class pay.

12
00:00:30.466 --> 00:00:33.166
I didn't steal the teacher's money

13
00:00:33.266 --> 00:00:33.700
i

14
00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.400
I really don't know why it's in my desk

15
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:36.300
summer

16
00:00:37.333 --> 00:00:38.133
You steal

17
00:00:38.133 --> 00:00:40.000
You stole it all into school

18
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.500
He is also a person who can even kill his own uncle

19
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.700
Your angel board is exactly using the day seed

20
00:00:45.766 --> 00:00:47.600
I didn't steal the money

21
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.500
I didn't even investigate, why did you wrong me?

22
00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.266
Are you still quibbling?

23
00:00:53.266 --> 00:00:54.100
Then you say

24
00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.166
Why should others go safely and freely?

25
00:00:56.166 --> 00:00:57.300
I wronged you.

26
00:00:57.566 --> 00:01:00.400
Summer should have known you were like this now

27
00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:02.766
I strangled you every day

28
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:08.300
You see

29
00:01:16.966 --> 00:01:18.366
Hum, show me.

30
00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:20.166
Where did you hold it?

31
00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:21.633
Where are you?

32
00:01:27.133 --> 00:01:28.033
Call out

33
00:01:31.366 --> 00:01:32.900
Hey quiet

34
00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:34.200
What are you doing?

35
00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:36.766
Isn't it enough that you humiliate our family?

36
00:01:36.766 --> 00:01:39.333
Lao Xia, what are you doing?

37
00:01:39.333 --> 00:01:40.766
You let him fight

38
00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:42.600
The police will come and take you away

39
00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.666
It just so happens that I can ask the police

40
00:01:44.733 --> 00:01:47.233
What is the crime of entering someone else's house in the toilet?

41
00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.266
Okay, okay, calm down too

42
00:01:50.266 --> 00:01:52.166
It's not a glorious thing either

43
00:01:52.166 --> 00:01:53.166
Please bear with me.

44
00:01:53.166 --> 00:01:54.566
Isn't he gone yet?

45
00:01:54.566 --> 00:01:58.200
When will the person who can be found by money be the head?

46
00:02:03.333 --> 00:02:05.966
Why don't you all come in when I'm dead?

47
00:02:06.566 --> 00:02:07.500
Anyway

48
00:02:08.466 --> 00:02:09.966
I'm dying.

49
00:02:10.666 --> 00:02:11.766
At that time

50
00:02:12.333 --> 00:02:13.600
We'll clear

51
00:02:16.133 --> 00:02:19.066
Okay, I'll show you.

52
00:02:19.733 --> 00:02:22.200
What do you see on this?

53
00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.566
How much did we spend from childhood to adulthood?

54
00:02:25.566 --> 00:02:27.500
400,000?

55
00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:28.866
You pay back the money

56
00:02:28.866 --> 00:02:32.533
Otherwise you're dead and you still owe us

57
00:02:32.533 --> 00:02:34.100
Take a look at you
