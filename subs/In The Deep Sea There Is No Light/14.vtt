summer

2
00:00:01.266 --> 00:00:03.800
Ziqin kindly introduces you to a target

3
00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:05.866
Look what you've done.

4
00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:07.533
Hey Xiao Liu

5
00:00:07.533 --> 00:00:09.866
I'm really sorry today.

6
00:00:09.866 --> 00:00:11.566
Come and sit at home in summer

7
00:00:11.566 --> 00:00:14.333
My aunt and I are very satisfied with you.

8
00:00:14.333 --> 00:00:16.233
Haha, don't mind.

9
00:00:19.766 --> 00:00:20.566
Yes

10
00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:22.433
I am sick

11
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.366
Then why don't you ever ask me why?

12
00:00:25.366 --> 00:00:27.600
Did something to me without asking why

13
00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.966
Dad?

14
00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.666
If that's what you want me to do

15
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.266
You know exactly what they did to me

16
00:00:40.266 --> 00:00:41.666
Why don't you say it?

17
00:00:41.666 --> 00:00:44.100
Lao Xia, is there something you are hiding from me?

18
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.000
Mom?

19
00:00:45.966 --> 00:00:49.000
Does it matter? Would you believe it?

20
00:00:49.466 --> 00:00:51.466
Would you rather believe Cheng Ziqing's side of the story?

21
00:00:51.466 --> 00:00:53.400
You don't want to believe a word I say

22
00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.933
Because you don't care at all

23
00:00:56.933 --> 00:00:58.766
Because I am a sinner

24
00:00:58.766 --> 00:01:01.166
I killed my uncle's family

25
00:01:01.166 --> 00:01:03.700
Shut up and don't kiss your uncle in front of me

26
00:01:06.766 --> 00:01:07.200
I am very

27
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.533
I will be buried with my uncle and his family soon.

28
00:01:09.533 --> 00:01:11.966
I hope you can be really happy by then.

29
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.666
Yangtze River, I have also prepared an answer for you.

30
00:01:14.733 --> 00:01:16.866
Hope you will like it then.

31
00:01:17.866 --> 00:01:18.666
summer

32
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.000
summer

33
00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.366
Don't open the door to strangers

34
00:01:23.366 --> 00:01:25.700
Don't talk to people you don't know, okay?

35
00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.166
Got it, got it, mom

36
00:01:29.166 --> 00:01:30.666
I'm 25 years old.

37
00:01:30.933 --> 00:01:32.566
Stop treating me like a child.

38
00:01:32.933 --> 00:01:34.300
Even 50

39
00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:36.266
In your mother's eyes, you are just a child

40
00:01:36.266 --> 00:01:37.700
Have you bought your tickets home yet?

41
00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.266
Your dad bought all your favorite food

42
00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.433
I bought it, I bought it, and I will be back in a while.

43
00:01:46.166 --> 00:01:48.233
Are moms so nagging?

44
00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.966
Yeah, doesn't your mom nag?

45
00:01:50.966 --> 00:01:52.366
Then you are so happy

46
00:01:52.366 --> 00:01:54.000
My mom is nagging

47
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.633
I'm so old and he always thinks I'm a kid

48
00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:59.566
Gone

49
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.666
My mom doesn't nag me at all

50
00:02:07.666 --> 00:02:09.633
She wants me to die outside

51
00:02:13.933 --> 00:02:16.600
Your kidney matched the patient over the summer

52
00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:17.966
Patient says 800,000 buy your kidney

53
00:02:17.966 --> 00:02:20.666
Can you come over now? I'll be right there.
