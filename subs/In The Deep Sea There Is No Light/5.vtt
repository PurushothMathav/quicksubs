00:00:00.966 --> 00:00:05.433
Hahaha, do you still want people to live?

2
00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:08.300
Forget it, what do you think we did?

3
00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:09.500
This thing is left.

4
00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:11.700
Oh, forget it, forget it.

5
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.700
He won't be at home for two days

6
00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:15.566
Not with him

7
00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:21.700
Yeah, mom.

8
00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:23.600
So just bear with it

9
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.700
After this year, you can be quiet

10
00:00:31.333 --> 00:00:32.300
So ugly

11
00:00:34.333 --> 00:00:36.900
It's like I'm sleeping longer and longer

12
00:00:37.866 --> 00:00:39.033
Almost dead

13
00:00:40.266 --> 00:00:41.433
Nice

14
00:00:55.666 --> 00:01:00.066
Hey, you are too lazy in summer, you don't get up until noon.

15
00:01:00.333 --> 00:01:03.533
What are you doing? Make your mother a few favorite dishes.

16
00:01:03.533 --> 00:01:04.366
Make amends for him

17
00:01:04.366 --> 00:01:06.900
Say sorry to Zhang Yi again.

18
00:01:07.366 --> 00:01:09.366
Just say it's to piss off your mother

19
00:01:09.466 --> 00:01:11.400
Nonsense can cook

20
00:01:11.466 --> 00:01:13.600
But I apologize, I refuse.

21
00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.500
Dad, you know I never lie

22
00:01:16.666 --> 00:01:19.100
Oh my god

23
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.600
You are not as obedient as a child

24
00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.666
Do what you were told to do as a child

25
00:01:24.666 --> 00:01:26.300
Never been so strong

26
00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:29.766
Your mother has a problem with you after your uncle died

27
00:01:30.266 --> 00:01:32.066
He is your mother after all

28
00:01:32.166 --> 00:01:32.966
Yes

29
00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:34.800
But dad

30
00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.300
Why did I become like this?

31
00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.533
You clearly know that my uncle's death has nothing to do with me

32
00:01:39.533 --> 00:01:42.600
You know what he did to me when I was a kid, don't you?

33
00:01:42.866 --> 00:01:46.000
Okay, okay, your mother is not well in summer.

34
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.400
And this scandal can't be faked

35
00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.600
If anyone knows about your uncle, he

36
00:01:52.466 --> 00:01:55.266
Our family will be poked in the spine by others

37
00:01:55.266 --> 00:01:56.366
So dad

38
00:01:57.066 --> 00:01:59.033
You do it for your so-called spine

39
00:01:59.333 --> 00:02:01.633
Can you sacrifice your daughter?

40
00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.033
Ok ok I won't tell you

41
00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.900
Oda

42
00:02:12.133 --> 00:02:16.100
I remember you like Coke chicken wings best

43
00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:17.233
Eat fast

44
00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:18.300
Finished eating

45
00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.766
Drink this bottle of cough syrup

46
00:02:20.766 --> 00:02:23.566
Your mom bought this especially for you

47
00:02:25.266 --> 00:02:27.133
I'm afraid you'll die of thirst at home.

48
00:02:27.133 --> 00:02:29.233
It's New Year's Eve, bad luck.

49
00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:36.500
Dad?

50
00:02:36.966 --> 00:02:39.966
You really can't eat anything too meaty.

51
00:02:40.166 --> 00:02:42.366
Or you can eat it yourself.

52
00:02:42.366 --> 00:02:43.500
If you don't eat it, get out of here

53
00:02:43.766 --> 00:02:45.133
If you want to make up, paint well

54
00:02:45.133 --> 00:02:46.266
Don't look at him like a ghost

55
00:02:46.266 --> 00:02:47.600
Who do you want to disgust?

56
00:02:47.733 --> 00:02:49.133
Are you trying to scare us to death?

57
00:02:49.133 --> 00:02:49.933
Zhang Jie

58
00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.900
Can't we have a good meal?

59
00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.066
Why do you have to make us angry?

60
00:02:55.066 --> 00:02:57.700
This Coke chicken wing is your favorite
