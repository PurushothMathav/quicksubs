00:00:07.566 --> 00:00:10.433
Chenchen, you are mom's only treasure

2
00:00:11.966 --> 00:00:13.566
I don't agree. The money can be sent away.

3
00:00:13.566 --> 00:00:14.500
What about yours?

4
00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:15.800
It's all feudal superstition

5
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:16.800
Oh, Chen Wen.

6
00:00:17.066 --> 00:00:18.900
Do you think I think so?

7
00:00:18.933 --> 00:00:19.700
There you go.

8
00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:22.866
You heard what the fortune teller said just now

9
00:00:22.866 --> 00:00:24.500
We never got pregnant

10
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.366
It is because the life of summer is too hard to carve

11
00:00:27.366 --> 00:00:30.400
We only sent him to your brother temporarily.

12
00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.366
Will we bring him back when we have a son?

13
00:00:33.366 --> 00:00:35.233
You don't want a son anymore

14
00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.100
All right.

15
00:00:42.533 --> 00:00:45.466
What's the matter, mom, I don't want your uncle's house

16
00:00:45.466 --> 00:00:47.866
Do you not love me anymore?

17
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.800
How could my mother not love you anymore?

18
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.866
You are mom's only treasure

19
00:00:56.366 --> 00:00:59.266
Summer, you better not let me know it's you

20
00:00:59.466 --> 00:01:01.700
Otherwise, I'll take the matter of you being handsome since you were a child

21
00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.233
Say to see you go

22
00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:06.000
concubine

23
00:01:06.266 --> 00:01:09.133
You come back in summer, you always make us angry these days.

24
00:01:09.133 --> 00:01:11.533
Do you know how much your mother loves you?

25
00:01:11.533 --> 00:01:13.900
In order to give birth to you, I also fell into confinement disease

26
00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.166
But I'd rather he never gave birth to me

27
00:01:17.266 --> 00:01:18.933
Do you think I want to give birth to you?

28
00:01:18.933 --> 00:01:20.766
If I had known you would be so nasty today

29
00:01:20.766 --> 00:01:23.100
I should have strangled you in the first place

30
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:23.900
Humph

31
00:01:24.766 --> 00:01:26.566
You're rotten as shit

32
00:01:26.566 --> 00:01:29.366
Why should we be pointed at?

33
00:01:29.366 --> 00:01:31.200
I've had enough of this.

34
00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:33.766
Get out of my house today

35
00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:40.700
I'm not leaving

36
00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.500
I want to spend this year with you
