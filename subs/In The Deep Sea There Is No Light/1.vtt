00:00:02.966 --> 00:00:08.066
321 Happy New Year

2
00:00:09.866 --> 00:00:13.633
Mom, you always say that when I die outside

3
00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:15.500
Now I'm finally going to die.

4
00:00:15.533 --> 00:00:17.033
Will you be happy?

5
00:00:26.366 --> 00:00:28.566
Hello 119?

6
00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:32.066
Can you come and collect my body?

7
00:00:32.133 --> 00:00:33.400
Excuse me?

8
00:00:34.266 --> 00:00:35.600
New Year's Eve

9
00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.766
Let you do such ashes

10
00:00:37.766 --> 00:00:39.033
But I think

11
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.233
If anyone sees my body

12
00:00:42.966 --> 00:00:44.366
Will not have a good year

13
00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:45.966
family

14
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.800
My mom loves me very much

15
00:00:50.933 --> 00:00:53.233
He will come to pick me up soon.

16
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.000
Little boy

17
00:00:55.733 --> 00:00:58.700
Remember to be obedient when you go to your uncle's house in the future, okay?

18
00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.800
Um, mom, are you still going to pick me up?

19
00:01:01.933 --> 00:01:04.066
Of course mom's coming to get you!

20
00:01:04.066 --> 00:01:05.866
After mom gives birth to a younger brother

21
00:01:05.866 --> 00:01:09.066
Mom, I'll be back to pick you up, okay?

22
00:01:09.066 --> 00:01:11.366
You are mom's little baby

23
00:01:12.366 --> 00:01:13.700
Let's go with uncle

24
00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:14.833
Go faster

25
00:01:14.966 --> 00:01:18.833
But when I was 18, my mother didn't come to pick me up.

26
00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:21.900
Until my uncle died

27
00:01:23.566 --> 00:01:27.966
In the summer, you go to kowtow to your uncle and aunt to make amends

28
00:01:27.966 --> 00:01:28.966
I'm not going.

29
00:01:29.566 --> 00:01:30.900
His death is his retribution

30
00:01:31.366 --> 00:01:33.400
Xiao Tian, you broom star

31
00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.600
If you hadn't gone out and run around at night

32
00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:36.933
You have to come to you

33
00:01:36.933 --> 00:01:39.200
How could he have been hit by a car?

34
00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.500
Why didn't you kill it?

35
00:01:43.133 --> 00:01:46.700
Mom, why can't you ask me?

36
00:01:48.366 --> 00:01:50.566
Help! What did he do to me?

37
00:01:53.066 --> 00:01:54.633
You want to die?

38
00:01:55.866 --> 00:01:58.300
Mom, why don't you ask me?

39
00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:00.500
Why would he do that to me?

40
00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.033
He has been here for 14 years

41
00:02:03.066 --> 00:02:05.966
Do you want to piss off your mother?

42
00:02:05.966 --> 00:02:08.100
Your uncle has died because of you

43
00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:09.366
What else do you want?

44
00:02:18.066 --> 00:02:19.033
Mom?

45
00:02:19.966 --> 00:02:21.800
Are you coming to pick me up?

46
00:02:22.333 --> 00:02:23.600
No, Mom.

47
00:02:23.666 --> 00:02:25.966
I don't want to go home with you anymore.

48
00:02:26.466 --> 00:02:28.266
If there is an afterlife

49
00:02:28.766 --> 00:02:32.500
Mom, I don't want to be your daughter anymore
