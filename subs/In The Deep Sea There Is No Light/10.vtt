00:00:00.466 --> 00:00:02.666
Don't cry, old sister

2
00:00:02.666 --> 00:00:05.700
I must have misread the person who is about to get married in the car

3
00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.400
How could he cheat?

4
00:00:07.733 --> 00:00:08.533
aunt

5
00:00:08.666 --> 00:00:11.300
Look, he sent all the other women Moments

6
00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:14.433
And he just broke up with me on WeChat.

7
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.566
He never wanted to marry me

8
00:00:16.666 --> 00:00:19.466
Looking for me is to make the child jealous

9
00:00:22.366 --> 00:00:24.566
I'm going to settle the bill for this bastard

10
00:00:24.866 --> 00:00:26.733
Please calm down.

11
00:00:26.733 --> 00:00:29.833
You must have made things worse

12
00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:34.733
Also, Xiao Chen Cai introduced me to a project

13
00:00:34.733 --> 00:00:36.866
If you make a fuss, it will definitely turn yellow.

14
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.100
What are you laughing at?

15
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.966
Your sister was cheated on.

16
00:00:42.966 --> 00:00:45.566
Not only do you not care about her, you laugh at her

17
00:00:46.366 --> 00:00:49.433
No wonder you were crying and making a fuss downstairs yesterday.

18
00:00:49.566 --> 00:00:51.333
If it weren't for Ziqin reminding me

19
00:00:51.333 --> 00:00:53.066
I almost fell for you again

20
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.500
I'm just lying to you.

21
00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.400
How could I die?

22
00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.500
A thousand years of scourge

23
00:01:00.333 --> 00:01:02.433
I want to activate you for the rest of your life

24
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:05.800
What traces do you have?

25
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:06.800
You say

26
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.733
Did you sleep in vain by that man again?

27
00:01:08.733 --> 00:01:10.566
Why are you so cheap?

28
00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.666
Remember how bad you coughed before.

29
00:01:13.933 --> 00:01:14.800
You are

30
00:01:15.333 --> 00:01:16.266
One more wave?

31
00:01:16.266 --> 00:01:17.433
Ah this

32
00:01:17.766 --> 00:01:18.566
Chen Wuqing

33
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.233
You have so much experience

34
00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.900
Do you think others are as cheap as you?

35
00:01:25.366 --> 00:01:27.466
You, you get out, you get out of here

36
00:01:27.466 --> 00:01:29.600
You and I see you are sick

37
00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.666
Are you trying to harm me?

38
00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.333
I told you on the first day.

39
00:01:35.333 --> 00:01:37.266
I just let him go let him go

40
00:01:37.266 --> 00:01:38.900
You still say patience

41
00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:41.000
This naturally bad-mouthed thing

42
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.800
We shouldn't have let him in

43
00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.866
Are you better now? Are you sick?

44
00:01:44.866 --> 00:01:46.933
What should we do if we infect it?

45
00:01:46.933 --> 00:01:48.166
And this house

46
00:01:48.266 --> 00:01:50.433
How can I save people in the future?

47
00:01:50.566 --> 00:01:53.400
Oh, is this not a New Year?

48
00:01:53.466 --> 00:01:54.266
Mom

49
00:01:55.366 --> 00:01:56.466
I don't have it.

50
00:01:58.266 --> 00:01:59.600
I'm allergic

51
00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:00.800
I beg you.

52
00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.166
Don't send me away

53
00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:03.833
Finally let me stay at home

54
00:02:03.933 --> 00:02:06.166
You go, you go outside

55
00:02:06.166 --> 00:02:09.266
You can do this, you know it's not a cake

56
00:02:09.333 --> 00:02:10.833
This is my sister

57
00:02:12.266 --> 00:02:14.666
What is it that is not a disease?

58
00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:17.433
You don't let me let you in

59
00:02:17.466 --> 00:02:18.700
Do you believe it or not?

60
00:02:19.666 --> 00:02:22.866
I'll spend another 1,000 bucks to find someone and it's you too

61
00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.166
You woman, I can't ask for it anymore.

62
00:02:26.166 --> 00:02:27.400
Chen Wan, what's wrong?

63
00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.200
How to drive people outside during the New Year

64
00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:30.466
You all know that.

65
00:02:30.466 --> 00:02:31.866
I only have one daughter

66
00:02:31.866 --> 00:02:34.500
I love him like I love my own eyeballs

67
00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.300
But he didn't learn well since he was a child

68
00:02:37.366 --> 00:02:40.866
My brother, you all got killed
