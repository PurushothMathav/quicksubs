00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:05.700
guarantee

2
00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:07.600
Going back there was an explosion

3
00:00:09.966 --> 00:00:11.266
I have to tell you this.

4
00:00:11.266 --> 00:00:12.866
Otherwise everyone will die

5
00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:19.366
Everybody, listen to me.

6
00:00:19.366 --> 00:00:20.800
There's going to be an explosion here.

7
00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.466
Everyone get out of here immediately

8
00:00:23.566 --> 00:00:25.100
How can it explode?

9
00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:26.933
That's a scary thing to say.

10
00:00:26.933 --> 00:00:29.166
The bride won't be happy and confused, will she?

11
00:00:29.666 --> 00:00:31.100
You believe me.

12
00:00:31.533 --> 00:00:34.166
Dream dream what are you talking about

13
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.400
Mom, get everyone out of here

14
00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:37.966
It's about to explode here

15
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.333
Possibly a gas line

16
00:00:39.333 --> 00:00:40.700
Or something else.

17
00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.033
You have to hurry up, manager

18
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.066
What is Mr. Su's order?

19
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.666
Let someone check it out

20
00:00:47.666 --> 00:00:49.566
See if there are any safety hazards

21
00:00:51.166 --> 00:00:54.000
But if they find the hidden danger

22
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:55.766
There would be no explosion.

23
00:00:56.166 --> 00:00:57.066
That's fine.

24
00:00:57.866 --> 00:00:59.933
Mr. Su has already had someone check it.

25
00:00:59.933 --> 00:01:01.100
Gas pipeline safety

26
00:01:01.133 --> 00:01:01.966
No hidden dangers

27
00:01:01.966 --> 00:01:02.933
Pardon me?

28
00:01:02.933 --> 00:01:03.866
That's not possible.

29
00:01:03.966 --> 00:01:05.400
There must be some disclosure

30
00:01:05.566 --> 00:01:08.000
Manager Ma, please find someone to check again.

31
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.933
I really can't, hurry up and disperse the crowd

32
00:01:09.933 --> 00:01:11.433
There's still time. That's enough.
