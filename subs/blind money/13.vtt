00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:05.800
Time goes round again

2
00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:07.800
I went back to China for 12 miles again

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.500
This time I'm going to save everyone

4
00:00:14.366 --> 00:00:15.233
You are

5
00:00:15.766 --> 00:00:18.133
Ah, are you crazy?

6
00:00:18.133 --> 00:00:19.500
Stanford Genius Doctor

7
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.566
Nobel Prize in Medicine winner Yanling Fu

8
00:00:21.566 --> 00:00:22.866
I know you are great

9
00:00:22.966 --> 00:00:24.900
But please put away your doctor's kindness

10
00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.466
I don't need you to help me heal

11
00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:29.100
Get away from me now

12
00:00:29.333 --> 00:00:30.600
inexplicable

13
00:00:31.133 --> 00:00:33.600
Ah, Doctor Fu wants to be perfunctory

14
00:00:33.933 --> 00:00:35.466
This is the only way

15
00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.566
Ah sir

16
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:39.833
Be careful old man

17
00:00:40.566 --> 00:00:43.500
Oops, are you alright? Oops.

18
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.000
I'm fine, I'm fine

19
00:00:46.533 --> 00:00:48.466
Girl, you saved me

20
00:00:48.466 --> 00:00:50.733
Oh, thank you, you don't have to thank me.

21
00:00:50.733 --> 00:00:51.866
You're fine.

22
00:00:51.866 --> 00:00:54.366
Ouch, I heard the nurse at the hospital say

23
00:00:54.366 --> 00:00:56.000
Your wife is undergoing chemotherapy

24
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.233
Difficult at home

25
00:00:57.366 --> 00:00:58.633
I have a card here.

26
00:00:58.666 --> 00:00:59.533
There is some money in it.

27
00:00:59.533 --> 00:01:01.000
You can take it and use it first, no, no.

28
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.300
Girl, I can't take your money

29
00:01:03.666 --> 00:01:05.000
Just take it.

30
00:01:05.566 --> 00:01:06.366
Oh, dear.

31
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.500
Ma'am, are you okay? I'm okay

32
00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.400
Madam, aren't you blind?

33
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.600
How did you see the flower pot fall?

34
00:01:17.366 --> 00:01:18.500
I heard it.

35
00:01:18.533 --> 00:01:20.166
Blind people have better hearing.

36
00:01:20.166 --> 00:01:22.400
This statement is too far-fetched

37
00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.833
Could it be that Xia Meng didn't actually go down?
