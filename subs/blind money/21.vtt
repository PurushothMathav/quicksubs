00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:02.866
Xia Meng, you are blind

2
00:00:02.866 --> 00:00:05.500
I didn't agree with your marriage back then

3
00:00:05.533 --> 00:00:07.766
You were in a hurry to marry my son

4
00:00:07.766 --> 00:00:10.933
I thought you would make a good wife

5
00:00:10.933 --> 00:00:13.966
I didn't expect you to do such a hatred

6
00:00:18.666 --> 00:00:21.400
I'm sad to marry his mother

7
00:00:21.533 --> 00:00:23.566
Li Yangchen has been chasing me for 5 years

8
00:00:23.566 --> 00:00:25.633
I married him because I was moved

9
00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:27.733
A snobbish woman like you

10
00:00:27.733 --> 00:00:29.100
Only interests in mind

11
00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:30.666
What emotion

12
00:00:30.933 --> 00:00:33.800
You are looking at my son graduating from a prestigious university

13
00:00:33.866 --> 00:00:34.966
Talented Hong Yi

14
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.866
That's why I wanted to marry him

15
00:00:36.866 --> 00:00:38.700
So that he can help you manage the company

16
00:00:38.966 --> 00:00:40.300
From start to finish

17
00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.466
You've been using my son

18
00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:44.066
I used him.

19
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.366
Your family was in debt back then

20
00:00:46.366 --> 00:00:48.400
He couldn't even afford Li Yangcheng's tuition

21
00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.266
I paid off your debt

22
00:00:50.266 --> 00:00:51.833
Helped Li Yangcheng pay the tuition fee

23
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.733
Later, I funded him to study abroad

24
00:00:53.733 --> 00:00:55.266
Get an MBA degree

25
00:00:55.266 --> 00:00:57.400
And brought him into the company and became the president

26
00:00:57.566 --> 00:00:58.833
Without me

27
00:00:58.900 --> 00:00:59.566
He Li Yangcheng

28
00:00:59.566 --> 00:01:02.500
Now I am an office worker with a monthly salary of 3,000

29
00:01:03.066 --> 00:01:05.133
My son is capable and talented

30
00:01:05.133 --> 00:01:06.333
Even without you

31
00:01:06.333 --> 00:01:09.366
With his achievements, it will not be worse than it is now

32
00:01:09.366 --> 00:01:10.600
My mom was right

33
00:01:10.766 --> 00:01:13.366
Don't think it's amazing that you have a little stinky money

34
00:01:13.366 --> 00:01:15.466
You are an incompetent blind man

35
00:01:15.466 --> 00:01:18.766
If I hadn't helped you out all these years

36
00:01:18.766 --> 00:01:20.833
You've already lost your fortune

37
00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.466
Okay, then give it back to me.

38
00:01:23.466 --> 00:01:26.233
Give me back everything I paid for before
