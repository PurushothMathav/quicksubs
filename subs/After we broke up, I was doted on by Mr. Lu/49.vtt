00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:02.070
I finally found out

2
00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:03.750
Mr. Lu was injured and discharged from hospital not long ago.

3
00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:06.810
You have also just been promoted to one of his personal photographers.

4
00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:09.750
Be sure to perform well today.

5
00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.130
I really want to make a good impression on Mr. Lu. Don't worry,

6
00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:16.640
uncle. Look at the design of this page to the waste collector soup.

7
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.560
Just this sincerity this morning.

8
00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.850
Mr. Lu will not be able to feel it. That's good.

9
00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:25.340
If you are lucky, you will be valued by Mr. Lu.

10
00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:28.480
From now on, you will be captured by Mr. Huang.

11
00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:31.820
When I entered Mr. Lu, that was all.

12
00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:32.600
Want to publicize

13
00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:43.140
Why are you still here?

14
00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:46.900
Who is that old man? That is

15
00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:54.380
They all said there is no need to send it.

16
00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:56.770
Now we need to find where it is

17
00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:59.800
Is it my responsibility?

18
00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:01.840
He came out to see you, yes

19
00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:03.700
After all, I help him browse the Internet for my son

20
00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.260
There must be a car to pick up the heavy load.

21
00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.200
Otherwise I wouldnâ€™t be able to guess it.

22
00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:12.560
Then you go ahead and I'm leaving.

23
00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:14.440
Hurry up and go to smoke and eat on the way, come here

24
00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:26.040
Still so arrogant

25
00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.500
It turns out that I hooked up with a rich old man.

26
00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.060
The company waiting for me to post my politics

27
00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:33.960
He is obviously very interested in fame and fortune.
