00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.360
It's because we are blind. It's all our fault.

2
00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:04.320
I don’t know, the future wife of the CEO,

3
00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:07.960
It's you. If no one takes care of me,

4
00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:11.800
I deserve to be punished by you if I don’t go. You apologize to me,

5
00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:14.320
I accept. But I hope you understand,

6
00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:17.750
The company speaks with its strength. Talk about your thoughts,

7
00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:21.380
Do things well and don't always think about doing Spanish things.

8
00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:29.780
Even good, you see, there is nothing dissatisfied.

9
00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.650
I'll tidy it up for you again. Already very good.

10
00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:35.530
Hard. Go get busy first. Okay okay.

11
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.790
My new office belongs to my own office.

12
00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:58.270
Captain Yang, why are you a Wensheng?

13
00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:01.660
The old-age suit you designed for Mr. Lu last time,

14
00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:02.560
He was very satisfied.

15
00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:04.340
This time I brought you some more

16
00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:05.160
continuation of sleep

17
00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.350
Over there are three sets of autumn suits.

18
00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:08.290
Continue to install three sets

19
00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:10.000
Two dinner outfits and public

20
00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:14.310
But if I have nothing else to do, I’ll leave first. You’re busy.

21
00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:26.860
He has no flowers

22
00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:29.040
Half a pound of fire

23
00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.750
A total of eight sets of general systems

24
00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:33.360
It's not always suitable for him to have a leader to show off his family.

25
00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.440
What am I doing with my fierce stuff?

26
00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:37.610
What kind of drama is this?

27
00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:42.150
Try everything you can with the fierce fire before you do it first

28
00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.270
Did you catch chronic allergies first?

29
00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:49.500
If you want something else, think first.

30
00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.690
What is it?
