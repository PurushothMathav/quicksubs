00:00:01.210 --> 00:00:02.750
This is your attitude towards the interview.

2
00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:08.430
That's it.

3
00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:10.760
Here comes the interview late.

4
00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:12.500
And there is no mark on academic qualifications.

5
00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.680
Neither is the design stuff. In order to know the state-owned industry.

6
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.280
Give us breath. I said it.

7
00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:22.900
This is what you call third-rate design.

8
00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:24.760
Let go of the entire design department.

9
00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:26.500
Who can design such a close relationship.

10
00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:30.560
Just a college gate.

11
00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:32.310
Maybe it was designed.

12
00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:34.430
Um. It's the shooter.

13
00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:36.570
Our company has spoken with the original body of Zhang.

14
00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:40.540
Zhongtian. It is a designer who has just been signed by our company.

15
00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:43.400
This time our company is only recruiting one person for the design position.

16
00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:45.650
It's adjustment. Although there is some talent.

17
00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:47.300
But Haraike Michichi also missed it

18
00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:50.130
Yes, Chi Dao is not for land use.

19
00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:51.730
This is the company's rules and regulations

20
00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:53.730
We also act according to rules and regulations

21
00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.990
Otherwise, please ask the provincial lady to come again next year.

22
00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:58.640
I just went for surveillance

23
00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.690
Video of someone actually taking her there

24
00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.330
I will investigate this matter

25
00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:07.870
It's Miss Chi. Please stay away.

26
00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:11.470
Moreover, her design is rated as being completely up to standard.

27
00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:15.400
So Lu Shi was forced to add a design

28
00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:19.580
What time do you want her to go to work?

29
00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:22.850
I can do it anytime

30
00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:25.900
That perfect colleague will connect with you directly

31
00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:28.920
Welcome home, thank you

32
00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:39.610
Dayman Shen Zhiâ€™s letter goes to 16 degrees

33
00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:42.390
Should be an employee of the company

34
00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.640
Specifically, which one can't?

35
00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.320
Will investigate
