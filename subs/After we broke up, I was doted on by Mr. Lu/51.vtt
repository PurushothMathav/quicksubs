00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.750
Go that way. Didn’t you mention that Jin Su designer before?

2
00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:07.060
Is this one of your personal looks?

3
00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:08.920
That’s right! Zhang Xinqiao.

4
00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:12.400
What is the income during the period when the certificate is transferred? It’s him too!

5
00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:17.370
I've seen how your Jin Su's manuscript turned into his design.

6
00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:20.520
I designed him. I put it on my desk.

7
00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.000
I don’t know why I went to shoot a story two days ago.

8
00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:26.760
Let's go! Don't listen to this nonsense.

9
00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:28.600
The gold sketch was designed by me.

10
00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:37.640
Mr. Guo. I always thought that I would deal with you during the transfer period.

11
00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:40.800
And I've always wanted you to be my personal stylist.

12
00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:53.340
Appearance is harmless.

13
00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:53.920
In fact, behind the scenes.

14
00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.180
He's just a guy who hooks up with good men.

15
00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:00.720
In winter, everyone, don’t learn to touch people with your mouth.

16
00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.160
Learn to touch people verbally

17
00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:04.940
I think you were attracted by me

18
00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:07.200
Then I admit my mistake, right?

19
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.650
I have evidence

20
00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:10.150
Everything I said was really bad

21
00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:11.910
What kind of person is he even?

22
00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:12.790
I know clearly in my heart

23
00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.420
Precaution, let’s do what I want when I go out. Is it true or false?

24
00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:21.790
I know all the scandalous things about me

25
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:22.820
Do it today

26
00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:24.410
I will send the true sentences to the group tomorrow

27
00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:25.310
let everyone know

28
00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:26.730
What kind of person are you?

29
00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:27.470
I've never done it

30
00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:29.600
Why do you have to admit it?

31
00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.040
Since you said you have this kind of group

32
00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:32.400
But just take it out and let me see it
