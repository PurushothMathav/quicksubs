00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:02.960
It's all a lot of fun. This is a very sparse network.

2
00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:09.430
You lawyers. Examine Zhihan,

3
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.240
You have the ability. He got on the road master's stage.

4
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:17.670
Even your takeaway gift flew up to the eating head and became a burden.

5
00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:18.890
Not as good as you.

6
00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:21.600
Just like borrowing a net, one opens his mouth and rushes forward.

7
00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:27.650
OK OK. good days,

8
00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:29.670
You qi-gathering things, catch up with me.

9
00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.380
I can't understand things.

10
00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:42.630
I thought you were that unforgettable road master,

11
00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:46.030
What do I tell my retainer.

12
00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:52.070
I didn’t say the price was short of your Lu Master’s Long Gongdan.

13
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.210
If this epidemic is 200, it might happen again.

14
00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:00.090
He is no Ye Sang

15
00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.510
Is there any loss in money from our expression?

16
00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:09.210
Compete with this downward approach

17
00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:10.950
I even dreamed that I was

18
00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.430
It’s the original little seat

19
00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:17.760
Liu Hua has always been unscrupulous

20
00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:19.000
You cooperate with him

21
00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:20.860
Hun is the first thousand

22
00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:21.880
Self-destruction of eight hundred

23
00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:22.940
Effective in the end

24
00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:29.080
Liu Hua is still alone, Miss Chen

25
00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:30.600
There are so many ways to be noble

26
00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:35.310
We've seen it too

27
00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:38.680
Chairman of Lushi Group

28
00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:40.310
You are the bad road

29
00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:41.530
That mysterious butterfly

30
00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:44.940
That would be great to publish a book

31
00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:49.430
I admit what you said is right

32
00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:50.580
I do this

33
00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:51.680
will cause us temporary losses

34
00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:52.460
So what if you can be him?

35
00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:56.440
Want to be rich
