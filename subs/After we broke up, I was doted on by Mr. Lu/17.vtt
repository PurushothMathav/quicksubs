00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:09.250
Aren’t these six routes prepared for the online merchant department of New Sincerity?

2
00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:12.560
Why are people here now? Could it be?

3
00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:16.660
Did I remember wrongly? Uploaded.

4
00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.980
You have passed the interview with our company. Regarding the next step, I officially came to work.

5
00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.440
According to management, the company will assign employees to each department first.

6
00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.290
Have a welcome party. Don't worry,

7
00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:35.960
Whether it's a party or work in the future.

8
00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:49.580
I will have the right to give you a beating. educate doctors,

9
00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:52.810
Our interview is over. I was late for interviews.

10
00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.480
There's no way I don't have time that's critical.

11
00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:00.140
When I returned to the company, a man who claimed to be an employee took me to my office.

12
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:01.720
I arrived a long time ago to find the troops.

13
00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:03.970
It's easy to distinguish the front desk so I think

14
00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.280
Please give me a chance for two interviews.

15
00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.560
I'm no longer like you, sorry

16
00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:27.060
not your hands

17
00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.270
It's better to learn how to squirt someone over there, of course.

18
00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:34.160
Know the real facts about this step

19
00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:36.520
Just don’t say it quietly and then you will recognize it by showing it.

20
00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.520
And I just saw your sword

21
00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.950
You are just a college student

22
00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.530
Put down the company's attractive standards

23
00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:46.970
All tempting

24
00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:48.060
What should be looked at is ability

25
00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.110
Rather than an academic community

26
00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:53.220
Could you please take a look?

27
00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:57.980
Just a third-rate water bottle

28
00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:59.760
Please leave immediately

29
00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:01.470
Don't make an experiment for us

30
00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:06.510
This is your attitude towards the interview
