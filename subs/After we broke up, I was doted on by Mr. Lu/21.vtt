00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:02.900
He was still bored and couldn't help but take care of his job.

2
00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:06.940
It seems that he is the legendary person who always pays special attention to his back.

3
00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:09.370
Yes. It's true that a hundred words are worth less than a first sight,

4
00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:12.650
As expected of a top designer, I have great temperament.

5
00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:15.490
You donâ€™t know two people now, but you want feelings,

6
00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.340
I will first get to know him as you do. good.

7
00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:23.390
You have another beauty.

8
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.510
Why do you want to take a look? Do you know him?

9
00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:34.980
He is a mediocre college player,

10
00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:36.600
How could I possibly know him.

11
00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:39.590
I just met him once during the interview, I guess.

12
00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:41.270
He was late then,

13
00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.430
And he also made a big fuss in the office.

14
00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.470
In the end, my uncle really had no choice.

15
00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:48.770
We can only have the money and let him go to the advanced design department to try it out.

16
00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:51.840
But this is only between interests

17
00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.780
He can't even survive his internship

18
00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:55.670
It will be good to be stabbed and pushed

19
00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:57.450
How could it be wrong

20
00:00:59.080 --> 00:00:59.960
Don't even connect people.

21
00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.320
Then who is not 985211 than others?

22
00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.290
He is a college player

23
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.040
Sorry to make trouble

24
00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:08.340
What about this kind of person?

25
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.380
You won't accompany us into a company to make trouble at all.
