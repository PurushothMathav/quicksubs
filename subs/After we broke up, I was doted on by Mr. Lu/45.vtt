00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:04.930
No, but that means,

2
00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.029
One person said that this way the body is generally weak.

3
00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.650
So he didn't recover very well.

4
00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.490
Yes, that's good. I brought you a few sets.

5
00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:18.050
But I said it’s not good yet.

6
00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:19.630
Then, what do you want me to do?

7
00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:23.460
I'm really sorry to help you. I'm a little busy first.

8
00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:27.700
Can't leave. If you don't choose, then help me.

9
00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:30.550
Nothing is too good.

10
00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.900
It doesn't matter, I can be hungry,

11
00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.800
Just wait until aunt comes.

12
00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.390
It's okay, if you don't mind it,

13
00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:40.970
That's okay with me.

14
00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.319
Are you okay? I hope to meet someone somewhere.

15
00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:15.170
That Mr. Luo is really hard to photograph

16
00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:19.170
It’s chicken soup again, it’s beef bone soup again, it’s pig iron soup again.

17
00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:21.400
I'll take a photo of you when you're so full

18
00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:25.510
Does this count as extra food?

19
00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:30.540
is that true
