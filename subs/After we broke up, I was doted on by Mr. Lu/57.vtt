00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:04.110
Look, look, look, this is the level of college students.

2
00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:07.830
Secret design. When I was in college,

3
00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:10.320
The design is out of this world.

4
00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.560
You are still awesome.

5
00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:14.540
Fortunately, look at your strength.

6
00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:16.540
The dress was designed and handed over for disassembly.

7
00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:20.400
Otherwise, take this kind of thing out. Our road is a designed face.

8
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:22.780
Keep letting it out of the cold and throw it in.

9
00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:24.900
Yes, yes, I am very lucky too.

10
00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:35.030
Madam, this is the red dress I designed for you

11
00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.850
conduct official business

12
00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:37.970
The inspiration for this dress

13
00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:40.390
Film roles shortlisted for Principles in Your Heart

14
00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:43.060
Lingke's designs can complement your elegant play

15
00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:48.320
It's not quite as tight as the repair strip. I'm sorry.

16
00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.070
Please ask

17
00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.730
Love this dress

18
00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:52.850
Are you dissatisfied?

19
00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:53.830
I can feel right

20
00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:55.260
The dress is beautiful

21
00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:56.960
That spirit is

22
00:00:58.190 --> 00:00:59.250
This dress is beautiful

23
00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.020
Because it is the most decorated designer in the history of Milan

24
00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:03.640
Rukaâ€™s paving and injection team three years ago

25
00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:07.110
Can I mention that I've worn it to a few inline international film festivals?

26
00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.630
And be able to read the other party in the future

27
00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:09.910
This lady

28
00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:11.950
Don't you know

29
00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:15.560
This must be a misunderstanding

30
00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:17.820
The year our family comforted Lin

31
00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.960
And the best woman award is close to each other

32
00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:22.070
The impact on this cluster is too profound

33
00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:23.860
You come up with a design like this

34
00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:26.260
Let's see both

35
00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.330
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes

36
00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:30.800
Sorry for the misunderstanding just now

37
00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:33.170
I hope this design draft will satisfy you
