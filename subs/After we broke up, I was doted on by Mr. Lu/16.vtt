00:00:02.009 --> 00:00:03.690
You should also come to Lushi for an interview.

2
00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:09.690
Did you take some back door?

3
00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.180
Anyway, this lady. I, a college student, am not talking to you about the green field economy right now.

4
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.640
What's the point of co-location economy?

5
00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:19.720
Lu Shi only recruits one designer,

6
00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:21.810
Having the last laugh counts.

7
00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:33.270
What's going on? You're calling me so noisily.

8
00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:35.500
Uncle, you are the interviewer this time,

9
00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:43.200
You must help me. Your education and experience are among the best among this group of interviewers.

10
00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.820
There should be no problem. But I just met someone,

11
00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:51.380
He is the only one who specializes in power, but his design is particularly excellent.

12
00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:55.130
I don’t know if I’m looking for a wall guy to tell you.

13
00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:57.650
If the interviewer sees her work,

14
00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:59.930
Will it be used to break up the road?

15
00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:03.860
A high-end student can enter the interview and change sections

16
00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:06.000
It shows that there is still some strength

17
00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:07.250
Don't worry, no matter what

18
00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:10.110
Drive her away. It’s easy to go.

19
00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:17.120
Are you here to interview for a designer position?

20
00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:20.300
Yes please come with me

21
00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:26.790
no start

22
00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.250
You can do it here first

23
00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:29.970
The interviewer will take you in later.

24
00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:32.000
Thank you It's okay
