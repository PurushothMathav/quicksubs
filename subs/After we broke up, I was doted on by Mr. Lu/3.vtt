00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:10.140
Who do you blame? Even the defeated ones are moved.

2
00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:17.380
We are close to home. I have a relationship.

3
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.750
Let's go.

4
00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:22.920
Loser. It took six.

5
00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.380
You are so hurt. I just plan to keep it together.

6
00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.380
As long as you become more expensive,

7
00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.540
The effect is apology. admit it's you,

8
00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:34.730
Shameless. I want to have enough.

9
00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.290
We will let you go. Is it as long as I bet on you?

10
00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:45.330
That's it. Make him expensive.

11
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.900
How?

12
00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.430
One delivers food. security guard.

13
00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:00.700
Posted everywhere, we are under human rights. stop.

14
00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.990
Because Linjia had a conversation with Mo Shi two weeks ago.

15
00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:07.480
If I remember correctly, we collaborated

16
00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:09.820
That project Jinneng should be

17
00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:17.130
It seems that the temporary group is because of this cooperation

18
00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.610
In January, it became one of the top financial groups in the world.

19
00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:21.480
Yes, yes, Yidu

20
00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:23.200
It's not like they collaborated on a joint recording

21
00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.230
Now the little place in your home

22
00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:27.930
You are so uneducated, I see
