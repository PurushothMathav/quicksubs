00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.320
I've already thrown away the receipt. This is the official website.

2
00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:07.140
No problem. You said the same thing and I thought I was.

3
00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:11.030
Who knows if this is a fake. They are all designers.

4
00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:13.960
You can tell if it's fake or not. Or say,

5
00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:17.960
What about you. But this skirt,

6
00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:19.680
Haven't you already changed it?

7
00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:24.570
Usually we have to look at the full amount. Didn't he just offer to pay compensation?

8
00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.720
Could it be said that in addition to clothes, you also plan to spend money on handicrafts.

9
00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:34.600
Oh, they are all colleagues, I must not be a customer.

10
00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:39.230
No way, no way. Mrs. Lu Shi, CEO of Tangtang,

11
00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.680
You can't even ask me why I can't go with you.

12
00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:44.530
Take out your phone

13
00:00:44.530 --> 00:01:02.400
Where is the injury field?

14
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:03.360
The next time I saw him, he was dressed differently

15
00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:06.140
Miss Shen's skirt was torn just now

16
00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.470
So she changed her clothes into a short film

17
00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:23.450
Original price question

18
00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.030
After using my uncle’s black card to get the discount,

19
00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:28.820
Only 1,500 yuan but changing clothes

20
00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:34.250
What just happened was indeed my fault

21
00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:36.550
But from now on we are all colleagues after all

22
00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.150
I don’t want to be overpaid, right?

23
00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:40.240
I'll give you a drink

24
00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.780
Just treat it as a knife for you.
