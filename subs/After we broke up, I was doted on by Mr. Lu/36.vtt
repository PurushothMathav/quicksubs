00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:03.970
It's okay. It's okay.

2
00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:05.610
You, a little girl, pretend to be running and watch.

3
00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.470
Uncle, because I was eating, I originally went through ten programs. Uncle?

4
00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:13.070
Occasionally, I'll be able to meet my old classmates nearby.

5
00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:15.370
We are more than ten days into it.

6
00:00:16.329 --> 00:00:18.580
This old man ran around and everyone asked him to do it.

7
00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:21.360
don't know. Well, I don’t believe you.

8
00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:25.550
Do you want to have more than one person serving the meal?

9
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:28.920
I mean, I just stopped by to visit my dad.

10
00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:38.690
My old classmate. Don’t want to.

11
00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:43.940
Miss you, which one of you? Hey, what? Can you look at it?

12
00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:45.120
Guess I didn't think about it

13
00:00:58.920 --> 00:00:59.140
Let’s talk about it first

14
00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:01.080
I'll knock on the door when I get home later and pick him up.

15
00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:06.620
You might as well talk about this later
