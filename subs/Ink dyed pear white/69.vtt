00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:01.433
What's your trouble?

2
00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:04.033
Is something wrong with you?

3
00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:06.600
Let me take you to the hospital

4
00:00:07.533 --> 00:00:08.333
Yeah.

5
00:00:09.666 --> 00:00:12.033
I may have been drinking too much.

6
00:00:13.766 --> 00:00:14.800
patient appears

7
00:00:16.266 --> 00:00:17.200
Get a good night's sleep

8
00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.900
You have to lose when you wake up

9
00:00:20.266 --> 00:00:22.600
The doctor said I'm fine

10
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:23.966
No infusion

11
00:00:24.133 --> 00:00:25.466
That won't work.

12
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:27.566
You are my wife

13
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.266
You can't have anything wrong.

14
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.700
Come be careful

15
00:00:52.266 --> 00:00:54.500
Mr. Shen is really as you expected

16
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.300
Miss Jiang is a medicine for being scared

17
00:00:56.566 --> 00:00:58.166
The strange thing is

18
00:00:58.166 --> 00:01:00.900
The medicine he grows is the same as the one you grew three years ago

19
00:01:02.333 --> 00:01:06.100
Three years ago, the Kim family tried to plot against me and I got rid of it

20
00:01:06.366 --> 00:01:09.433
But they refused to admit to the drug

21
00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:13.700
Xiao Guo

22
00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:16.400
Let's find out what happened three years ago

23
00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:17.800
Double check

24
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.566
And find someone to keep an eye on the Bai family

25
00:01:20.733 --> 00:01:22.800
Bai Family, do you suspect white sex?

26
00:01:23.466 --> 00:01:24.633
That's impossible.

27
00:01:24.666 --> 00:01:27.200
Three years ago, he was willing to save you innocently

28
00:01:27.366 --> 00:01:30.700
Teaching you last night gave me a very familiar feeling

29
00:01:31.333 --> 00:01:33.300
Much like the woman from three years ago

30
00:01:34.166 --> 00:01:35.300
Nothing is absolute

31
00:01:35.966 --> 00:01:38.866
Remember before things are investigated clearly

32
00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:40.700
It's really important to keep a low profile

33
00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.933
Good to post what you photographed online

34
00:01:47.933 --> 00:01:51.366
Good publicity for this talented designer

35
00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.366
I stole your credit three years before the funeral

36
00:02:00.533 --> 00:02:04.166
3 years later, you still want to be with Amo

37
00:02:04.533 --> 00:02:05.633
get involved
