00:00:00.466 --> 00:00:01.266
Ha ha.

2
00:00:01.733 --> 00:00:04.866
Husband, wake up!

3
00:00:05.733 --> 00:00:07.833
Hurry up and talk to your wife more

4
00:00:12.133 --> 00:00:13.433
Brother Mo

5
00:00:15.466 --> 00:00:16.266
Brother Mo

6
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:18.933
What's wrong with you lately?

7
00:00:18.933 --> 00:00:21.266
You said that this jade pendant box is for my aunt to eat

8
00:00:21.266 --> 00:00:22.066
Neither

9
00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.600
Are you going to smoke now?

10
00:00:26.533 --> 00:00:28.933
Miracle, it's alright

11
00:00:28.933 --> 00:00:30.233
You should find a Fengxia in a few days.

12
00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:50.200
I finally married you.

13
00:00:55.166 --> 00:00:56.700
Start today.

14
00:00:56.866 --> 00:00:58.400
We swap identities

15
00:00:58.766 --> 00:01:00.100
It's your turn to support me

16
00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:03.200
Certainly!

17
00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:17.766
The happiest life

18
00:01:27.533 --> 00:01:28.333
Humph

19
00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:31.000
Yo, big brother is really not wearing it.

20
00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.166
Doctor, my wife, what's the situation?

21
00:01:36.166 --> 00:01:38.600
Why does she feel nauseous when I kiss her?

22
00:01:39.133 --> 00:01:40.566
This is a normal physiological reaction

23
00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:43.233
Normal physiological response

24
00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:46.300
His physiology is everything to me

25
00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:47.233
He wanted to vomit.

26
00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.633
I really can't. How can I use a lifetime of information?

27
00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.800
This is a disease that needs to be treated

28
00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:52.866
What to treat

29
00:01:52.966 --> 00:01:55.700
Is your wife pregnant from my medical practice?

30
00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.666
These are the first naturally thin triplets I've ever seen.

31
00:01:57.666 --> 00:01:58.466
Gong Xiaomei

32
00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:00.366
triplets
