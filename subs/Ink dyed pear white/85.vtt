00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:05.266
Don't struggle, don't struggle

2
00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.466
Your dream brother can't find it here

3
00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:10.700
Even if you find it

4
00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:14.033
You are also a corpse bent by me.

5
00:00:15.366 --> 00:00:16.266
Okay?

6
00:00:19.166 --> 00:00:21.000
The person who raped you

7
00:00:21.266 --> 00:00:22.733
It's your brother Mo

8
00:00:22.733 --> 00:00:28.233
Hahahahahahaha

9
00:00:39.466 --> 00:00:41.166
You must be my lucky star

10
00:00:41.166 --> 00:00:43.066
Then you won't wait for the rest of your life

11
00:00:43.066 --> 00:00:45.233
Alian, I'm serious.

12
00:00:45.733 --> 00:00:47.433
You were my first woman

13
00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.300
Also my favorite woman

14
00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:50.866
I won't leave you.

15
00:00:51.133 --> 00:00:52.866
I will always be by your side

16
00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:54.400
Alian

17
00:00:55.266 --> 00:00:56.866
Will you marry me?

18
00:00:56.866 --> 00:00:59.300
I will definitely marry you when I find it.

19
00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.200
I can find you when I grow up

20
00:01:01.466 --> 00:01:03.766
You will marry me then

21
00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.500
Hahahaha

22
00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:18.100
Ah!

23
00:01:29.566 --> 00:01:31.200
Aren't you awesome?

24
00:01:31.666 --> 00:01:33.600
You have not died at my hands

25
00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:35.466
Hahaha

26
00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:38.633
You don't want to marry

27
00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:41.033
Obviously this is a dog man and woman

28
00:01:41.166 --> 00:01:43.100
We will never be together in this life

29
00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.666
Haha Harlem heart

30
00:01:46.766 --> 00:01:49.200
Didn't you say we would be together forever?

31
00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.166
Don't be cowardly

32
00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:51.500
My mother

33
00:01:52.066 --> 00:01:54.266
You woke up Lin Xin

34
00:01:58.733 --> 00:02:00.166
No, it's a heart attack.

35
00:02:00.266 --> 00:02:01.633
Take the car and pay.

36
00:02:06.666 --> 00:02:08.833
Your family members may have more to say to him

37
00:02:08.933 --> 00:02:10.566
Try to rest assured to do business, right?

38
00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:12.100
Amo

39
00:02:12.866 --> 00:02:14.166
Wake up

40
00:02:16.866 --> 00:02:17.800
Amo

41
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.366
Mom, you are the only one.

42
00:02:22.866 --> 00:02:25.366
If you have something to do

43
00:02:26.133 --> 00:02:27.900
How do I live?
