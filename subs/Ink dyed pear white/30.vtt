00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:03.366
Isn't a security guard just a company dog?

2
00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:04.533
Just hear the call

3
00:00:04.533 --> 00:00:07.000
And he just sort of ran in.

4
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.200
I wanted to surprise you

5
00:00:13.366 --> 00:00:15.900
But as soon as I came in, I heard a dog barking

6
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:16.833
Afraid of being bitten

7
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.766
And I'm coming in.

8
00:00:17.766 --> 00:00:18.766
Who are you calling a dog?

9
00:00:18.766 --> 00:00:20.166
Who are you calling a dog?

10
00:00:20.366 --> 00:00:22.900
Believe it or not, I'll have someone break your leg first

11
00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:23.733
We are prosperous

12
00:00:23.733 --> 00:00:26.466
How can you roll in the bottom garbage bag like you?

13
00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:30.600
Three minutes later.

14
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:34.100
You will know who should get out of the prosperous world

15
00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:35.033
Smelly security guard

16
00:00:35.166 --> 00:00:38.133
Your cat ran into dead mice a few times ago.

17
00:00:38.133 --> 00:00:40.366
You really think of yourself as a big shot

18
00:00:40.533 --> 00:00:42.433
You open your eyes and see clearly

19
00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.500
This is Saatchi Design.

20
00:00:44.933 --> 00:00:46.766
It's Mr. Liu, hahaha.

21
00:00:46.766 --> 00:00:50.166
Weak, your sister looks so smelly and sweaty

22
00:00:51.066 --> 00:00:52.700
Not only is he poor

23
00:00:53.166 --> 00:00:54.300
Still a nerd

24
00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.500
No one in the entire Haicheng knew about Shengshi Design

25
00:00:58.766 --> 00:01:00.833
It's Liu

26
00:01:01.133 --> 00:01:02.900
Three minutes to

27
00:01:03.266 --> 00:01:04.066
Ha ha.

28
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.000
Mr. Liu is such a stinky security guard

29
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.166
Give him three minutes

30
00:01:08.166 --> 00:01:10.700
I'll give him three lifetimes, and he's still a stinky security guard

31
00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.566
Stinky brain, hurry up and get out of here, hurry up

32
00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:17.866
Dad, why are you here?

33
00:01:18.066 --> 00:01:19.800
It's just brain smashing

34
00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.200
What if you go down?

35
00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:25.000
How did my father raise such a fool as you?

36
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.833
Dad, why are you hitting me?

37
00:01:29.166 --> 00:01:32.700
Are you the docking person of Shen's Group?

38
00:01:32.933 --> 00:01:34.300
This is a microphone.

39
00:01:34.533 --> 00:01:35.666
It's an honor.

40
00:01:35.766 --> 00:01:36.666
Shengshi Design

41
00:01:36.666 --> 00:01:39.500
Can become a subsidiary of the Shen Group
