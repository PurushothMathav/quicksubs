00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:02.266
It's good to be alive

2
00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:05.866
Miss, you have the wrong person, right?

3
00:00:05.933 --> 00:00:09.366
No way we were together

4
00:00:09.566 --> 00:00:11.833
I have been working here for more than half a year

5
00:00:13.566 --> 00:00:14.566
Excuse me?

6
00:00:14.566 --> 00:00:17.266
I had some sequelae before because of the supply.

7
00:00:17.266 --> 00:00:18.966
Just now my brain is not very good

8
00:00:20.166 --> 00:00:21.466
I was here.

9
00:00:23.566 --> 00:00:27.500
Yeah, I was wondering if you were a college student

10
00:00:27.666 --> 00:00:30.066
Why are you in the flesh business with me?

11
00:00:31.866 --> 00:00:32.900
What to comment on

12
00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.666
Hey, no.

13
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.966
You were serving plates and drinks

14
00:00:38.966 --> 00:00:40.666
Only once

15
00:00:44.066 --> 00:00:45.400
Baby, stop dawdling

16
00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:49.100
I miss you to death, Mr. Chen's family is here

17
00:00:49.266 --> 00:00:52.366
I'll start work first, let's talk later, friendship

18
00:00:54.866 --> 00:00:55.666
Wife

19
00:00:56.066 --> 00:00:57.066
Got it.

20
00:00:58.166 --> 00:00:59.633
Who was that person just now?

21
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:03.566
do not know

22
00:01:06.866 --> 00:01:08.933
These clubs again 3 years ago

23
00:01:08.933 --> 00:01:11.500
Is it really just a coincidence?

24
00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:15.433
Hey

25
00:01:16.866 --> 00:01:19.233
Wife sit here

26
00:01:19.333 --> 00:01:20.833
Just eat fresh tea

27
00:01:27.933 --> 00:01:28.700
Tomorrow afternoon.

28
00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.500
Our city will host the 10th International Architecture Competition

29
00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.966
Many designers at home and abroad are invited to participate

30
00:01:33.966 --> 00:01:34.866
This competition

31
00:01:34.866 --> 00:01:37.300
The organizer is undertaken by Shen Group

32
00:01:38.133 --> 00:01:38.933
OK

33
00:01:39.666 --> 00:01:40.866
I really want to go

34
00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.433
Go if you want

35
00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.566
Then the registration is closed.

36
00:01:48.566 --> 00:01:50.600
At this level of competition?

37
00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.666
Usually some are invited

38
00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.700
Talented and famous designers

39
00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.633
Maybe tomorrow you'll be invited as soon as you wake up

40
00:01:59.933 --> 00:02:02.966
There's nothing wrong with listening to you

41
00:02:02.966 --> 00:02:04.600
Of course I'm complimenting you

42
00:02:04.866 --> 00:02:06.300
The kind that comes from the heart

43
00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.900
OK

44
00:02:08.866 --> 00:02:09.966
Go cook

45
00:02:11.333 --> 00:02:12.600
Isn't this doing?
