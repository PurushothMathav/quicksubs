1
00:00:00.066 --> 00:00:01.200
You fools

2
00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:03.166
Open your eyes and take a good look

3
00:00:03.166 --> 00:00:05.000
It's not just a pattern.

4
00:00:05.266 --> 00:00:07.966
It's also Miss Jiang's fingerprints, that's right

5
00:00:08.666 --> 00:00:11.266
And now I can put my fingerprints

6
00:00:11.266 --> 00:00:12.566
Step down

7
00:00:12.666 --> 00:00:14.000
Compare with each other.

8
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.400
It took a long time

9
00:00:31.733 --> 00:00:35.066
Someone has been copying someone else's work since three years ago

10
00:00:35.066 --> 00:00:36.966
And the face is raking here

11
00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.500
Take someone else's design to the competition

12
00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:40.400
And get an award

13
00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.166
Aren't you ashamed?

14
00:00:42.166 --> 00:00:43.033
More than 20 years

15
00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.100
You just said that according to the rules of the game

16
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.033
Plagiarists don't have to be here

17
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:50.833
But it turns out

18
00:00:51.066 --> 00:00:52.833
You are the plagiarist

19
00:00:53.333 --> 00:00:54.200
You see

20
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.333
Did you walk out of there by yourself?

21
00:00:57.333 --> 00:01:00.400
Or am I annoying?

22
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.800
It's designed to complement each other.

23
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.033
There are similarities, but I can't say anything.

24
00:01:08.533 --> 00:01:09.600
The eldest is the youngest

25
00:01:09.766 --> 00:01:10.633
worthy of yourself

26
00:01:12.766 --> 00:01:17.066
Ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the overlords of design

27
00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.666
The winning points of this competition are

28
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.266
Miss Manager

29
00:01:24.733 --> 00:01:26.900
Then this money is not available to my users.

30
00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.000
Miss Chen Zongjiang is really outstanding

31
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.966
Why don't you hurry up and marry your wife?

32
00:01:33.133 --> 00:01:34.166
Use your words

33
00:01:34.866 --> 00:01:35.666
That's right.

34
00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.500
Help me investigate

35
00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.166
The weak white design

36
00:01:39.166 --> 00:01:40.466
What is between you?

37
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.200
What's that?

38
00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:45.600
Congratulations!
