Su Yaruo

2
00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:03.733
Adi fell from the mountain

3
00:00:03.733 --> 00:00:05.300
I will definitely go through and through

4
00:00:05.866 --> 00:00:07.533
Everyone who has hurt her

5
00:00:07.533 --> 00:00:09.200
Will be punished accordingly

6
00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:10.833
Now please go out

7
00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:13.466
Don't disturb my Adi rest

8
00:00:14.666 --> 00:00:15.666
Brother Mo

9
00:00:15.766 --> 00:00:17.766
What kind of ecstasy did this bitch give you?

10
00:00:17.766 --> 00:00:19.200
Don't listen to him

11
00:00:19.466 --> 00:00:20.466
Su Yaruo

12
00:00:21.666 --> 00:00:23.266
Fake can't be real

13
00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.333
My old affair with Brother Mo

14
00:00:25.333 --> 00:00:27.933
I didn't write anything down in my diary

15
00:00:27.933 --> 00:00:29.500
You said you were Jiang Linxing

16
00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:30.600
Then you say one

17
00:00:34.766 --> 00:00:35.966
You question me?

18
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.600
I'm in a mess right now

19
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.800
Brother Mo once

20
00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.033
I fell on my bike

21
00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:44.966
Brother Mo saved me

22
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.766
Accidentally hurt my hand

23
00:00:47.766 --> 00:00:51.000
May I ask if he hurt his left hand or his right hand?

24
00:00:51.933 --> 00:00:52.833
Take a gamble

25
00:00:53.466 --> 00:00:54.366
right hand

26
00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:56.500
Hey

27
00:00:57.066 --> 00:00:57.966
left hand

28
00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.033
I just activated

29
00:01:04.533 --> 00:01:05.466
How come?

30
00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.666
It's my right hand, it just hurts me.

31
00:01:11.166 --> 00:01:12.300
Su Yaruo

32
00:01:14.533 --> 00:01:15.333
go out

33
00:01:16.166 --> 00:01:17.100
In addition

34
00:01:18.266 --> 00:01:18.766
I advise you

35
00:01:18.766 --> 00:01:21.266
Now you can take your whole family and run away

36
00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.166
Because no matter where you escape to the ends of the earth

37
00:01:24.333 --> 00:01:25.800
I will chase you

38
00:01:25.933 --> 00:01:27.500
Avenge my Ali

39
00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:38.300
It's all over now

40
00:01:38.933 --> 00:01:41.200
Doctor, why don't we go abroad?

41
00:01:42.466 --> 00:01:44.300
Shen's Group is distributed globally

42
00:01:44.333 --> 00:01:45.700
It's useless to go abroad

43
00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.000
Hello

44
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:51.866
What!

45
00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:53.600
Ah!

46
00:01:55.066 --> 00:01:57.066
It was a false alarm

47
00:01:57.066 --> 00:02:00.000
Okay, okay, okay, hahaha.

48
00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:04.900
According to the latest news

49
00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:06.666
Orphanage coverage the day before yesterday

50
00:02:06.666 --> 00:02:08.333
Inside the world's first audit

51
00:02:08.333 --> 00:02:09.766
Not a modern character

52
00:02:09.933 --> 00:02:10.666
Associated journalists

53
00:02:10.666 --> 00:02:12.966
What was photographed was nothing more than a general part of the hotel

54
00:02:12.966 --> 00:02:13.766
pass employee

55
00:02:14.166 --> 00:02:16.066
Journalists involved in the Oolong incident

56
00:02:16.066 --> 00:02:17.500
Has been fired from this station

57
00:02:17.866 --> 00:02:19.200
Don't believe rumors don't spread rumors

58
00:02:19.266 --> 00:02:21.033
Everyone stay awake

59
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.166
I already said

60
00:02:23.166 --> 00:02:25.700
This kid can't be the richest man at all

61
00:02:26.666 --> 00:02:29.266
Mr. Shen, the style of your last photo exposure

62
00:02:29.266 --> 00:02:30.500
It has been dealt with.

63
00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.300
Unleashed some smoke bombs of fake news

64
00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:34.500
You are now an ordinary waiter
