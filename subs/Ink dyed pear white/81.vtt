00:00:06.133 --> 00:00:07.066
Hey Ali

2
00:00:07.133 --> 00:00:09.000
Why didn't your boyfriend come to help you move?

3
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.066
That is.

4
00:00:10.766 --> 00:00:13.133
He recently got a new job

5
00:00:13.133 --> 00:00:15.633
I'm busy until one or two in the morning every day.

6
00:00:15.766 --> 00:00:17.400
Don't I feel sorry for him?

7
00:00:17.766 --> 00:00:20.500
If you don't say it well, there is no way.

8
00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.966
Youyou, you are so distressed to see that you are not married yet.

9
00:00:22.966 --> 00:00:25.066
It's gotta be married

10
00:00:25.066 --> 00:00:28.033
Just the two of you

11
00:00:28.166 --> 00:00:30.633
Okay, I'll go to the door to see the driver

12
00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:32.166
Otherwise you won't be able to find your way

13
00:00:32.166 --> 00:00:33.666
Then you go and open the room for you.

14
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.033
Oh, dear.

15
00:00:40.733 --> 00:00:43.300
Manager, you son of a bitch

16
00:00:48.133 --> 00:00:51.633
Hey, if I can't get you, I'll destroy you

17
00:01:06.466 --> 00:01:07.266
Adi

18
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.433
Adi, talk to me

19
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.866
Adi, what happened? Adi?

20
00:01:13.133 --> 00:01:14.700
Are you in a hurry?

21
00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.433
Ali Ali must not have an accident.

22
00:01:36.533 --> 00:01:38.800
How is Big Brother Ali?

23
00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:41.100
I'll move things downstairs with Arigo

24
00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.333
He asked us to check if the car at the door was coming

25
00:01:43.333 --> 00:01:44.400
There we go.

26
00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.866
We came back and saw Ali lying in the snow

27
00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.366
Hiring a driver

28
00:01:51.366 --> 00:01:51.966
Hurry up and help me

29
00:01:51.966 --> 00:01:53.800
Invite the best experts in the world to Ali

30
00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:55.666
Go to the exhibition

31
00:01:55.666 --> 00:01:56.466
And

32
00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:58.800
Please check out the partnership for me.

33
00:02:07.333 --> 00:02:08.666
Don't be noisy

34
00:02:08.733 --> 00:02:09.600
How is he?

35
00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:10.900
This makes my wife feel bad

36
00:02:10.966 --> 00:02:12.133
May not wake up

37
00:02:12.133 --> 00:02:13.200
Prepare yourself mentally

38
00:02:17.966 --> 00:02:19.266
What can I do?

39
00:02:19.266 --> 00:02:20.466
I want him to be well

40
00:02:20.766 --> 00:02:21.700
My habit

41
00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.500
I want to mess with the hospital compared to the funeral
