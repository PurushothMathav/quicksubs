1
00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.566
A total of 1 billion market value has evaporated

2
00:00:03.866 --> 00:00:06.666
If I hadn't heard you say what you are dead on

3
00:00:06.666 --> 00:00:08.800
I won't let you come back from abroad

4
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.066
Now.

5
00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:12.600
Our Bai family is over

6
00:00:12.933 --> 00:00:15.900
Oh, dad, can't you be reconciled?

7
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.600
Are we just accepting small favors from the Shen family?

8
00:00:18.733 --> 00:00:20.566
If I could be Mrs. Shen

9
00:00:20.566 --> 00:00:21.533
Finish Bai's house

10
00:00:21.533 --> 00:00:24.033
You can inherit the top rich family of Haicheng

11
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.100
you

12
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.100
greedy

13
00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:28.600
Must be a disaster

14
00:00:39.566 --> 00:00:40.366
Mr. Shen

15
00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.466
I just did a full body check on Miss Jiao

16
00:00:42.466 --> 00:00:43.800
Except for exogenous head

17
00:00:43.966 --> 00:00:45.066
No problem.

18
00:00:45.333 --> 00:00:47.266
Then why hasn't he woken up yet?

19
00:00:47.266 --> 00:00:48.200
Is that so?

20
00:00:48.366 --> 00:00:50.366
Miss Jiao should have experienced a miscarriage a few days ago

21
00:00:50.366 --> 00:00:51.466
The body has not recovered

22
00:00:51.466 --> 00:00:52.633
So keep waking up

23
00:00:58.466 --> 00:01:00.366
OK, I see.

24
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.266
This matter about Miss Shen Zongjiang

25
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.533
No one should know

26
00:01:07.533 --> 00:01:08.566
Is it Mr. Shen?

27
00:01:21.466 --> 00:01:22.266
Oh, dear.

28
00:01:25.933 --> 00:01:27.600
Are you feeling unwell?

29
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.300
I remove my clothes

30
00:01:35.133 --> 00:01:36.200
Don't go

31
00:01:37.533 --> 00:01:39.166
Don't leave me alone

32
00:01:46.333 --> 00:01:47.566
Don't worry.

33
00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.400
I won't leave you.

34
00:01:50.666 --> 00:01:52.366
I will always be by your side

35
00:01:53.166 --> 00:01:54.766
The rumors outside

36
00:01:54.766 --> 00:01:56.366
I've already dealt with my feelings

37
00:01:56.533 --> 00:01:56.866
later

38
00:01:56.866 --> 00:01:59.033
No one will say a word more about you.

39
00:02:01.533 --> 00:02:02.466
That's okay.

40
00:02:03.066 --> 00:02:04.466
The cleaner clears himself

41
00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.800
Ignore the gossip

42
00:02:10.966 --> 00:02:11.766
That's right.

43
00:02:12.466 --> 00:02:14.433
I just had a nightmare

44
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.300
I had a dream about a man who was holding me down.

45
00:02:19.166 --> 00:02:20.500
Can't see his face

46
00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.400
I can't remember what he did to me

47
00:02:24.766 --> 00:02:26.066
Just think

48
00:02:27.166 --> 00:02:28.800
I feel a little sad
