00:00:06.533 --> 00:00:08.733
Sorry, judges

2
00:00:08.733 --> 00:00:09.366
Judges

3
00:00:09.366 --> 00:00:10.700
I would like to ask

4
00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:13.666
It's my work. Is there something wrong with it? The designs.

5
00:00:15.166 --> 00:00:17.000
No problem, it's yours.

6
00:00:17.533 --> 00:00:20.100
I don't quite understand what the judges mean

7
00:00:20.966 --> 00:00:22.266
What the judges mean

8
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.100
You plagiarize

9
00:00:27.733 --> 00:00:30.800
Miss Bai, since you say I plagiarize

10
00:00:31.166 --> 00:00:32.766
Please make it clear

11
00:00:32.766 --> 00:00:36.433
Miss Jiang, you really don't shed any light or tears

12
00:00:36.866 --> 00:00:38.700
If only it had been said

13
00:00:38.933 --> 00:00:42.700
I'm afraid you can't get along in the design world

14
00:00:43.566 --> 00:00:48.433
Yes, people are timid and not magnanimous

15
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.633
I saved you face.

16
00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:52.700
Don't know what's good

17
00:00:53.366 --> 00:00:55.766
Hurry up and take what you plagiarized

18
00:00:55.766 --> 00:00:57.700
This past year's design competition?

19
00:00:57.866 --> 00:01:00.166
They are all high-level designers.

20
00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.833
Even if there are occasional words that are flat

21
00:01:04.066 --> 00:01:06.966
That's not like competing with copied works?

22
00:01:08.133 --> 00:01:08.933
Master

23
00:01:09.566 --> 00:01:11.466
Justice is still being done

24
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.200
You dare to take this kind of garbage

25
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.866
No.

26
00:01:15.866 --> 00:01:19.933
Do you mean that I plagiarized Miss Bai's work?

27
00:01:19.933 --> 00:01:20.966
Or else?

28
00:01:21.166 --> 00:01:23.666
With a designer like you

29
00:01:23.733 --> 00:01:25.666
Can design such a hand

30
00:01:27.766 --> 00:01:29.166
This design draft

31
00:01:29.266 --> 00:01:32.033
It's a design I completed 3 years ago

32
00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.966
I haven't copied anyone for three years

33
00:01:35.133 --> 00:01:39.100
Your picture was held by Miss Bai 3 years ago

34
00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.200
He has won the design gold award internationally

35
00:01:42.366 --> 00:01:44.000
Are you going to plagiarize in the future?

36
00:01:44.766 --> 00:01:46.700
Use your brain to check the information

37
00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.666
At least change it.

38
00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.100
How can it be exactly the same?

39
00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.333
All right, judges and teachers, stop talking

40
00:01:52.333 --> 00:01:56.033
I think Miss Jiang must be jealous of me

41
00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.066
That's why they plagiarized my work

42
00:01:59.066 --> 00:02:01.200
As expected of the eldest lady of the Bai family

43
00:02:01.566 --> 00:02:04.566
Look at this tolerance, this eagle

44
00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:06.133
What are you still doing here?

45
00:02:06.133 --> 00:02:07.600
Get out of here

46
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.666
Our competition of this specification

47
00:02:09.766 --> 00:02:11.700
You are not allowed to copy shamelessly like this.

48
00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:12.733
Strike progress

49
00:02:12.733 --> 00:02:14.266
I'll say it again.

50
00:02:14.566 --> 00:02:16.033
I didn't plagiarize.

51
00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.700
Since Miss Jiang refuses to leave by herself, I can only

52
00:02:22.566 --> 00:02:23.366
Good night

53
00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.166
Please ask Miss Jiang to deal with it.
