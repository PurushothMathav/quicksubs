00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:03.666
My daughter is the childhood sweetheart of the richest man in the world

2
00:00:03.866 --> 00:00:05.333
And that's a good thing?

3
00:00:05.333 --> 00:00:07.066
Hurry up and call the general back

4
00:00:07.066 --> 00:00:09.833
Aren't we related to Mr. Shen?

5
00:00:10.166 --> 00:00:11.166
Don't forget.

6
00:00:11.566 --> 00:00:13.866
How did you two approach education before?

7
00:00:14.466 --> 00:00:16.100
If Mr. Shen found out

8
00:00:16.333 --> 00:00:17.700
We all have to die

9
00:00:18.266 --> 00:00:20.166
Coco, I'm his mother

10
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.233
That's too much.

11
00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:24.766
It should be fine.

12
00:00:26.533 --> 00:00:27.700
What to do then?

13
00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:29.266
Jiang Li is an idiot

14
00:00:29.533 --> 00:00:31.433
I remember so much detail in the diary

15
00:00:31.866 --> 00:00:33.366
I really have to thank him

16
00:00:33.366 --> 00:00:34.866
Then there is only one way

17
00:00:35.666 --> 00:00:37.300
Just from now on

18
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.266
I'm being reasonable.

19
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.233
Only I took his place

20
00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:44.100
Our family

21
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.500
To usher in the wealth of the sky

22
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.066
Hahaha, my daughter is still smart.

23
00:00:50.066 --> 00:00:51.600
Dad listens to you

24
00:00:51.666 --> 00:00:54.033
Hahaha dad

25
00:00:54.966 --> 00:00:56.233
Remember to treasure the export

26
00:00:57.933 --> 00:00:58.766
put your heart

27
00:00:59.533 --> 00:01:01.266
Wrapped on the mountain

28
00:01:23.533 --> 00:01:24.666
President of Shen Group

29
00:01:24.666 --> 00:01:27.066
Give tens of millions of gifts to Haicheng writers

30
00:01:28.266 --> 00:01:30.700
Master Zheng, let me pick you up

31
00:01:32.866 --> 00:01:35.633
Brother, I knew you would come back for me

32
00:01:36.533 --> 00:01:37.666
Who are you?

33
00:01:38.333 --> 00:01:39.200
Jiang Lina

34
00:01:39.866 --> 00:01:41.366
Don't you recognize me?

35
00:01:42.166 --> 00:01:43.433
I thought...

36
00:01:44.066 --> 00:01:45.600
You will always remember me

37
00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:47.933
How come?

38
00:01:47.933 --> 00:01:48.533
This Woman

39
00:01:48.533 --> 00:01:50.700
How can there be pictures of Ali and I when we were children?

40
00:01:51.866 --> 00:01:53.666
It seems that you really don't remember me

41
00:01:54.166 --> 00:01:54.966
count

42
00:01:55.966 --> 00:01:57.766
Just pretend it's me

43
00:01:57.766 --> 00:01:59.866
You are really Ali, right?

44
00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:02.300
Then do you remember

45
00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:05.033
Did we make a pact at the orphanage when we were kids?
