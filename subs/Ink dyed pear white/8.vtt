00:00:04.933 --> 00:00:05.966
Sister is quite beautiful

2
00:00:10.166 --> 00:00:13.233
Daughter will take you to meet an adult

3
00:00:26.866 --> 00:00:30.066
Do you know who Mr. Shen is looking for? I know

4
00:00:30.066 --> 00:00:31.866
Come, come, wait for me.

5
00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:35.233
The woman he is looking for is his great-grandmother

6
00:00:35.766 --> 00:00:39.566
It is said that his great-grandmother practiced the art of immortality

7
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:40.966
Just like Tianshan Tong

8
00:00:40.966 --> 00:00:42.166
true or false?

9
00:00:46.266 --> 00:00:47.066
Hey

10
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.633
The waiter refills my glass.

11
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.166
Where did that girl go just now?

12
00:00:53.966 --> 00:00:55.900
I'm calling you, I didn't hear you go

13
00:00:55.966 --> 00:00:57.933
Hey you stinky waiter

14
00:00:57.933 --> 00:00:59.166
How do they talk?

15
00:00:59.166 --> 00:01:00.666
Do you not want to live?

16
00:01:01.566 --> 00:01:04.633
Hey, what about you, how dare you ignore me?

17
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:06.800
brother

18
00:01:07.366 --> 00:01:08.166
that

19
00:01:08.366 --> 00:01:09.666
court death.

20
00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.166
You stinky waiter

21
00:01:12.166 --> 00:01:13.833
How dare you scold me!

22
00:01:14.366 --> 00:01:16.066
What a blind waiter

23
00:01:16.166 --> 00:01:17.866
How dare you offend the tyrants

24
00:01:17.866 --> 00:01:20.400
Just don't kneel down and apologize

25
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.433
Kneel down for me

26
00:01:21.466 --> 00:01:23.066
What about you, kneel down

27
00:01:23.066 --> 00:01:23.666
Do you hear me?

28
00:01:23.666 --> 00:01:24.566
Let me tell you something.

29
00:01:24.566 --> 00:01:25.766
You kneel now

30
00:01:25.766 --> 00:01:26.566
Hey

31
00:01:26.866 --> 00:01:29.766
Mind your own business, that waiter bothers me

32
00:01:30.166 --> 00:01:31.733
No, that's not too expensive.

33
00:01:31.733 --> 00:01:34.266
Don't you stop

34
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.166
Open up for me

35
00:01:41.166 --> 00:01:42.000
start

36
00:01:42.966 --> 00:01:44.500
Brother, are you alright?

37
00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:45.666
Let's go!

38
00:01:45.666 --> 00:01:47.000
Kill you really kill you

39
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.666
Bitch, how can you speak?

40
00:01:49.666 --> 00:01:51.000
Roll stinky girl

41
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.133
Stop meddling here

42
00:01:52.133 --> 00:01:53.266
Ouch hello

43
00:01:53.933 --> 00:01:55.366
Good looking

44
00:01:55.366 --> 00:01:57.166
Is this stupid?

45
00:01:57.166 --> 00:01:58.766
For a stupid waiter

46
00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.600
Give the wealthy one after another

47
00:02:02.266 --> 00:02:03.500
Are you running fast?

48
00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:07.500
Run!

49
00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.633
Brother Mo, run, run
