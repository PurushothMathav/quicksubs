00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:03.466
Jiang Li, you shot me

2
00:00:03.733 --> 00:00:05.766
I kill you don't

3
00:00:07.866 --> 00:00:09.433
Ah security

4
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.700
Get this crazy woman out of here

5
00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:17.700
Let go of Jiang Li

6
00:00:17.766 --> 00:00:20.266
I can't eat chili I'll kill you let me go

7
00:00:20.266 --> 00:00:21.300
let go

8
00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:26.066
It was a pleasure working with you all.

9
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.533
But I hope that in the future

10
00:00:28.533 --> 00:00:31.066
You have the ability to tell right from wrong.

11
00:00:31.466 --> 00:00:34.366
Don't be inspired by these inexplicable things anymore

12
00:00:38.666 --> 00:00:40.100
Why does it appear online?

13
00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:41.966
What about the photo of Elton messing around?

14
00:00:42.866 --> 00:00:44.400
Who is filming

15
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.400
Well, what didn't you see today?

16
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.500
What's the matter? It's alright.

17
00:00:54.133 --> 00:00:56.900
Don't you usually surf the internet?

18
00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:58.766
No waves

19
00:00:59.366 --> 00:01:00.366
Not bad. Not bad.

20
00:01:00.366 --> 00:01:02.166
It seems that the person who helped me was not him

21
00:01:02.166 --> 00:01:04.833
Who does good deeds without leaving their names?

22
00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:07.100
eldest sister

23
00:01:07.933 --> 00:01:10.866
Remember when I was a kid I liked to eat fish

24
00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.833
Then wake up at that time

25
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.233
He's still like this

26
00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.233
So you can eat it every day?

27
00:01:20.466 --> 00:01:22.933
Then you can come out and kill the fish for sale.

28
00:01:22.933 --> 00:01:25.300
Don't go to the clubhouse to work anymore

29
00:01:25.966 --> 00:01:26.800
Ha ha.

30
00:01:27.366 --> 00:01:28.800
Hey little girl

31
00:01:29.933 --> 00:01:32.433
How can sharks be as simple as you say?

32
00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.033
Look at your husband's fine skin and tender meat

33
00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.900
Have you ever done manual work?

34
00:01:37.066 --> 00:01:40.133
Boss, don't look down on my husband

35
00:01:40.133 --> 00:01:42.833
He's such a fool for a shark, isn't he?

36
00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.800
The boss is in a hurry, okay, okay.

37
00:01:52.866 --> 00:01:55.100
Don't go, hold me and give you a reason

38
00:02:07.133 --> 00:02:08.433
A total of 28 yuan

39
00:02:11.766 --> 00:02:13.866
The formula between you two is quite tacit, right?

40
00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.233
It's not that I rented the store to the two of you

41
00:02:16.533 --> 00:02:17.833
Boss, come here.

42
00:02:17.966 --> 00:02:19.566
Hey, here you are.

43
00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:24.500
get out of the way

44
00:02:25.533 --> 00:02:26.766
No way.

45
00:02:27.133 --> 00:02:29.300
This land is a bit special

46
00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:32.333
Your father, Mr. Wei, personally said that demolition cannot be carried out

47
00:02:32.333 --> 00:02:33.266
It cannot be demolished.
