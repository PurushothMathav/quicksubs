Yue Zhou, were you really fierce just now?

2
00:00:02.766 --> 00:00:03.700
Oh.

3
00:00:04.766 --> 00:00:07.600
Hey, Xiao Zhou, you just came to save me

4
00:00:07.866 --> 00:00:10.300
Ah, hahaha, yeah, I'll give you some first.

5
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.066
You obviously miss me, why don't you give it to me?

6
00:00:14.766 --> 00:00:17.333
I seem to have left my kidney first in the fight just now

7
00:00:17.333 --> 00:00:18.366
I'll check it for you.

8
00:00:18.366 --> 00:00:19.433
Are you okay?

9
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:22.400
Hey, don't you know how to set bones?

10
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.833

Doctor, is his injury really okay?

14
00:00:37.533 --> 00:00:39.266
Do you need to be hospitalized for observation?

15
00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.366
How worried are you about the cost?

16
00:00:41.366 --> 00:00:42.666
Can I teach it?

17
00:00:45.333 --> 00:00:47.200
It's okay, it's just something outside the skin.

18
00:00:47.933 --> 00:00:50.066
Is the boy so good?

19
00:00:50.066 --> 00:00:51.233
This is your blessing.

20
00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.433
I'll quit first

The past that has been experienced in turn is on the way

23
00:01:06.366 --> 00:01:07.800
What the hell is going on?

24
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.100
Tell grandpa

25
00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:10.900

Mr. Shen, a dignified president of the Shen Group

30
00:01:24.733 --> 00:01:27.433

32
00:01:31.266 --> 00:01:32.200
Right.

Hey, why didn't I react at the time?

34
00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.233
Why does this bastard look like a little white face?

35
00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:42.366
How could it be Mr. Shen?

36
00:01:43.066 --> 00:01:43.866
Humph

37
00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.633
I think this kid is tired and crooked

38
00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:53.200
Live right?

39
00:01:53.733 --> 00:01:54.533
Ah!

40
00:01:55.133 --> 00:01:57.066
By the way, oops.
