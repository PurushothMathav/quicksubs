00:00:01.466 --> 00:00:02.500
Do you care?

2
00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:04.066
Good evening, let's have dinner

3
00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:08.333
Oh, it's a woman who just came back from abroad.

4
00:00:08.333 --> 00:00:09.966
Invite me to get together tonight

5
00:00:10.766 --> 00:00:13.300
I just got back from abroad, sorry.

6
00:00:13.933 --> 00:00:16.866
I didn't hear what Zhenxing said

7
00:00:16.933 --> 00:00:19.700
I said you're married now

8
00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:20.666
There is access control at home

9
00:00:20.666 --> 00:00:22.366
You have to be home by 10:00

10
00:00:22.366 --> 00:00:24.066
Otherwise, you can sleep on the street for me

11
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:27.700
Open your eyes.

12
00:00:30.966 --> 00:00:33.666
He's just an irrelevant person.

13
00:00:33.666 --> 00:00:35.666
If you don't want me to go, I won't go.

14
00:00:35.933 --> 00:00:37.166
In my heart.

15
00:00:46.733 --> 00:00:48.266
Why haven't you come yet?

16
00:00:52.366 --> 00:00:53.733
Miss Bai, don't wait

17
00:00:53.733 --> 00:00:56.066
Mr. Shen didn't promise you to come again

18
00:00:56.733 --> 00:00:57.766
That's impossible.

19
00:00:58.366 --> 00:01:00.766
Don't look at the monk's face, look at the Buddha's face

20
00:01:00.766 --> 00:01:02.433
I am a daughter of a hundred families

21
00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:03.466
He can't be

22
00:01:04.533 --> 00:01:06.966
Mr. Shen is busy being sweet with his wife

23
00:01:06.966 --> 00:01:08.200
When are you free to see you?

24
00:01:10.133 --> 00:01:12.033
The bitch who seduced Shen Mo

25
00:01:12.333 --> 00:01:13.633
Who is it?

26
00:01:14.666 --> 00:01:16.133
There are also listing designs.

27
00:01:16.133 --> 00:01:17.466
Recently robbed us and Shen shi

28
00:01:17.466 --> 00:01:18.800
All cooperation lists

29
00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.033
The person in charge is called Jiang Li

30
00:01:25.066 --> 00:01:26.033
Why does it sound so familiar?

31
00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:28.800
Here's his file.

32
00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.833
It turned out that I plagiarized his work back then

33
00:01:35.266 --> 00:01:37.600
Then wasn't it that night 3 years ago?

34
00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.233
The person who really saved Amo
