00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:02.766
Xiao Ming does control control himself

2
00:00:03.566 --> 00:00:04.400
What would you say?

3
00:00:04.733 --> 00:00:05.633
Control yourself

4
00:00:05.966 --> 00:00:06.833
What would you say?

5
00:00:07.266 --> 00:00:08.466
Control doesn't matter.

6
00:00:17.933 --> 00:00:21.266
Hero Chen is here again, hi, Xiaoxinchang, eh?

7
00:00:21.266 --> 00:00:23.900
Hero Chen is a new crab in my house today

8
00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:24.800
It's pretty big.

9
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.200
I'll give you one, you're too kind.

10
00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:46.600
Hey, what's wrong with you?

11
00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:48.333
Why are you so haggard?

12
00:00:48.333 --> 00:00:50.066
I'm imaginary brother

13
00:00:50.466 --> 00:00:51.666
I'm waiting for you.

14
00:00:51.966 --> 00:00:53.800
Don't let you mess around don't let you mess around

15
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.366
Be careful, grandma's family law resigns

16
00:00:56.533 --> 00:00:57.633
I'm not messing around.

17
00:00:58.333 --> 00:00:59.700
This sister-in-law and that best friend

18
00:01:00.133 --> 00:01:01.600
That's pretty raw.

19
00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.466
I can't even reply to him on WeChat now.

20
00:01:03.566 --> 00:01:04.800
Afraid of what he looks like

21
00:01:07.566 --> 00:01:08.366
both of us

22
00:01:08.933 --> 00:01:10.066
Let's be together.

23
00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.666
Hey, but brother, you and sister-in-law have been getting the certificate for so long

24
00:01:16.666 --> 00:01:18.033
I haven't seen you selling

25
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.600
Is there any comparison?

26
00:01:22.566 --> 00:01:24.600
Is this a little hand?

27
00:01:38.533 --> 00:01:39.333
boss

28
00:01:39.866 --> 00:01:41.600
Sublimation is on his account?

29
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.066
I'm going shopping.

30
00:01:46.166 --> 00:01:48.433
Boss, get me some too.

31
00:01:49.166 --> 00:01:49.966
Adi

32
00:01:50.566 --> 00:01:51.566
He's back!

33
00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.600
I'm back.

34
00:01:55.133 --> 00:01:56.833
What do you want to eat?

35
00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.000
celery

36
00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.600
Then fry a carrot

37
00:02:11.733 --> 00:02:13.066
I have something to discuss with you.

38
00:02:13.066 --> 00:02:15.766
Let's snap up barbecue at 8 o'clock tonight

39
00:02:15.866 --> 00:02:17.500
Is it about the happiness of sisters?

40
00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:18.833
You are not allowed to come
