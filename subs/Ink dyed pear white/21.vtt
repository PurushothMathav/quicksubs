Why the hell would anyone dare to break into the old company today?

Youth is a big deal

13
00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.066
Are you going to give a dowry?

14
00:00:44.333 --> 00:00:46.033
Send it to them first

15
00:00:46.133 --> 00:00:48.233

00:00:53.366 --> 00:00:55.933
The founder of the Shen Group

19
00:00:55.933 --> 00:00:57.166
Madam Shen

00:00:57.366 --> 00:00:58.966
Big shot like him

Dad?

23
00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:05.300
You don't have to be humble

24
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.566
The old lady means

25
00:01:06.566 --> 00:01:08.166
Choose the cheapest auspicious day

26
00:01:08.166 --> 00:01:09.266
Get married as soon as possible

27
00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:14.666
This is ouch.

28
00:01:15.366 --> 00:01:17.100
Here.

29
00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.900
Dad, what's going on?

30
00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.700
How did this guy meet you?

31
00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.533
How could the hook be given to me?

32
00:01:24.533 --> 00:01:26.166
Liar my man

33
00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:30.100
Is this liar under the old lady of God?

34
00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:32.900
But I don't know Mrs. Shen

35
00:01:33.466 --> 00:01:36.766
Hey, was there an old lady before?

36
00:01:37.133 --> 00:01:39.433
He wants you to marry his grandson

37
00:01:42.266 --> 00:01:44.466
I've been talking to a few wealthy old ladies recently

38
00:01:44.466 --> 00:01:45.500
Playing mahjong

39
00:01:45.733 --> 00:01:47.700
They must have taken a fancy to me

40
00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.266
I lost a few words in front of Madam Shen

41
00:01:50.933 --> 00:01:52.866
That's right.
