00:00:00.733 --> 00:00:02.300
Are you almost ready?

2
00:00:02.533 --> 00:00:03.800
Success or failure

3
00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:05.400
Well, it's all set.

4
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:06.900
It will be available in a while.

5
00:00:07.066 --> 00:00:08.666
Thank you for your hard work. Come on.

6
00:00:10.066 --> 00:00:12.766
What to do? There's only the last minute left.

7
00:00:12.766 --> 00:00:13.966
Do I want it or not?

8
00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:16.366
He seems to really take it seriously.

9
00:00:16.366 --> 00:00:17.966
If I really delay the listing

10
00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:19.533
Will he be disappointed in me?

11
00:00:19.533 --> 00:00:21.000
If it is not listed on time

12
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.033
They will be disappointed in me too

13
00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.066
You're going to get punished for that.

14
00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:27.633
Come on. I can't be too selfish.

15
00:00:30.133 --> 00:00:32.100
Secretary Li, you won't go back on it, will you?

16
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:33.666
No, I won't.

17
00:00:33.733 --> 00:00:35.266
Ok I believe in you

18
00:00:35.266 --> 00:00:36.466
Then you go downstairs now

19
00:00:36.466 --> 00:00:37.566
Let me give you something

20
00:00:37.666 --> 00:00:38.566
What's that?

21
00:00:38.566 --> 00:00:41.200
You'll know when you go downstairs, it won't waste your time.

22
00:00:47.466 --> 00:00:49.100
What are you going to give me? Get in the car.

23
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.333
No, I have something else to do.

24
00:00:50.333 --> 00:00:51.533
Just give it to me directly.

25
00:00:51.533 --> 00:00:54.500
My stuff is too expensive for others to see

26
00:01:03.766 --> 00:01:04.866
I'm sorry.

27
00:01:05.066 --> 00:01:07.233
I also have to make sure my plan is foolproof
