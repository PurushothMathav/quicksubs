00:00:01.333 --> 00:00:02.333
Have you seen Secretary Li?

2
00:00:02.333 --> 00:00:03.966
I think he took the elevator down not long ago

3
00:00:03.966 --> 00:00:04.733
Haven't come back yet?

4
00:00:04.733 --> 00:00:06.066
Can't find it?

5
00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:08.100
Xu Tao

6
00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:11.766
Thank you, aren't you ready to go public?

7
00:00:11.766 --> 00:00:12.800
What about Secretary Li?

8
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.100
Wasn't he just here?

9
00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:16.166
No

10
00:00:16.933 --> 00:00:19.400
Li September, indeed, still betrayed me

11
00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:20.766
It's okay, I have a backup plan

12
00:00:20.766 --> 00:00:21.866
What backup plan?

13
00:00:21.866 --> 00:00:23.500
It was Secretary Li who asked me to come

14
00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:25.833
He also sent me all the plans for me to assist

15
00:00:25.866 --> 00:00:28.166
Even if he is not there, it will not affect the listing.

16
00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:36.733
What's wrong, Zhao Zixuan?

17
00:00:36.733 --> 00:00:37.900
You are despicable and shameless

18
00:00:38.733 --> 00:00:39.966
I advise you not to shout

19
00:00:39.966 --> 00:00:42.000
I've booked all the rooms on this floor

20
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.600
It's useless even if you yell

21
00:00:44.866 --> 00:00:46.766
Zhao Zixuan, what do you want to do?

22
00:00:47.133 --> 00:00:48.266
What do you think?

23
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.166
I'm afraid you won't be able to keep your promise.

24
00:00:50.166 --> 00:00:51.766
I just tied you up

25
00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.266
Good for everyone.

26
00:00:53.266 --> 00:00:54.700
You think you keep me here?

27
00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:56.366
Can't the company go public?

28
00:00:56.933 --> 00:00:59.666
I have already sent the backup to Xu Tao

29
00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.466
I knew you'd go back on it.
