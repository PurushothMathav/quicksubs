00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:01.400
10,000 volt

2
00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:03.333
Then I was directly electrocuted to ashes

3
00:00:03.333 --> 00:00:05.066
But be brave for this task

4
00:00:05.066 --> 00:00:05.800
I like it

5
00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:07.833
I didn't expect you to be so capable

6
00:00:07.933 --> 00:00:10.300
You will be my big brother from now on.

7
00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:12.500
Then see if you can help me pick two pieces.

8
00:00:12.733 --> 00:00:15.500
Let me buy it, I've had a good time

9
00:00:16.866 --> 00:00:19.966
Hmm, this one?

10
00:00:20.066 --> 00:00:21.966
This is not for sale.

11
00:00:22.733 --> 00:00:23.833
Why not sell

12
00:00:24.166 --> 00:00:26.733
Then I have to buy it?

13
00:00:26.733 --> 00:00:27.866
You are what

14
00:00:28.733 --> 00:00:31.433
If you don't sell it, you won't sell it.

15
00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.300
You earn a lot of money, kid.

16
00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:36.600
It's all luck

17
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:37.500
It's all luck

18
00:00:38.666 --> 00:00:41.266
You can't take it with you at these times

19
00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.366
We must take away what we buy.

20
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.266
Believe it or not, I called a car of brothers

21
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.566
Okay, take something away, leave your life, call me

22
00:00:53.366 --> 00:00:54.500
Uh-huh.

23
00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:57.000
Ah!

24
00:00:59.966 --> 00:01:02.600
He's an enemy anyway, I'll go first

25
00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.000
Saving him a life is about to be weak

26
00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.200
The foundation is about to be laid.

27
00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.200
Ah, I'm just keeping it for you, ah, ah.

28
00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.366
Ah, detected rescue person lost

29
00:01:16.566 --> 00:01:17.466
The foundation is about to be laid

30
00:01:23.966 --> 00:01:26.866
I'm giving you artificial respiration, be careful
