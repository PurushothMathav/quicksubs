00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.800
Secretary Li, why do you look so listless?

2
00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:05.466
Did you work overtime last night too tired to rest well?

3
00:00:05.466 --> 00:00:06.266
Nope.

4
00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:09.366
Please worry more about my listing

5
00:00:09.366 --> 00:00:11.666
Please don't overdue.

6
00:00:11.966 --> 00:00:13.166
Got it, Mr. Xu

7
00:00:13.166 --> 00:00:16.466
It is better for you to do this yourself.

8
00:00:22.533 --> 00:00:24.833
Taotao, I made you a love lunch

9
00:00:25.933 --> 00:00:27.866
Sorry about your secretary

10
00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.000
Looks like you finally figured it out

11
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.166
I just want you to chase Lin Mengqi away

12
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:39.666
What do you want me to do?

13
00:00:39.666 --> 00:00:41.000
He told you today

14
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.300
Do you want the company to go public within a month?

15
00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:44.633
How do you know?

16
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.066
You are eavesdropping

17
00:00:46.133 --> 00:00:48.066
Who uses that sleazy stuff?

18
00:00:48.066 --> 00:00:51.133
In short, you only need to delay the company's listing for a few days

19
00:00:51.133 --> 00:00:53.966
Even for an hour and a minute

20
00:00:54.866 --> 00:00:57.300
Well, it has been detected that Xu Tao has received a new task.

21
00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.700
The company will be rewarded for going public within one month

22
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:01.666
Gain Invisibility for an Hour a Day

23
00:01:01.666 --> 00:01:04.166
You will receive a reward after stopping him from completing the task

24
00:01:04.166 --> 00:01:07.900
Xu Tao, what's the difference between you and a transparent person now?

25
00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:10.166
Hmm, it's ridiculous to think about it before

26
00:01:10.166 --> 00:01:12.100
You don't have these superpowers right now

27
00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:13.566
What are you?

28
00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.033
Am I delaying the listing by two days?

29
00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:17.566
Will he be with me?

30
00:01:17.566 --> 00:01:19.800
This is the agreement between him and Mengqi

31
00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.800
As long as the company goes public within a month

32
00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.200
Mengqi will marry him

33
00:01:24.133 --> 00:01:27.466
Hey, I don't want Mengqi to fall into the hands of others

34
00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:28.500
You don't want to either

35
00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.766
The person next to Xu Tao is not you

36
00:01:30.766 --> 00:01:33.800
Right? If the company goes public within a month

37
00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.300
There is no room for manoeuvre

38
00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:36.700
Is it bad for you?

39
00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.666
It's just a delay of a few days for the company to go public

40
00:01:38.666 --> 00:01:40.666
It's good for everyone, isn't it?
