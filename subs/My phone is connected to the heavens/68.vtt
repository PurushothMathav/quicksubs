00:00:03.166 --> 00:00:05.666
He deserved to die, he shouldn't have been saved in the first place

2
00:00:05.666 --> 00:00:07.000
Should have let you die

3
00:00:07.266 --> 00:00:10.466
Xu Tao, I wouldn't have died if it weren't for you

4
00:00:10.466 --> 00:00:12.266
Blood is thicker than water

5
00:00:12.266 --> 00:00:14.300
You know it's a trap, you still come

6
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.966
Hey come to me

7
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.466
Been hiding outside

8
00:00:22.466 --> 00:00:23.900
It's not the way to go down

9
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.800
I had to do something.

10
00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.800
Hello, it's me.

11
00:00:30.966 --> 00:00:32.800
Isn't this Miss Lin?

12
00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:35.666
What do you want me to do by coming to me so late?

13
00:00:35.666 --> 00:00:37.166
Can you spare us?

14
00:00:37.333 --> 00:00:39.966
It's not that I asked me to do something.

15
00:00:40.766 --> 00:00:42.666
Didn't you invite me here?

16
00:00:42.666 --> 00:00:44.733
Why are you putting on such a dead look?

17
00:00:44.733 --> 00:00:46.633
Do you really let go of stones?

18
00:00:50.066 --> 00:00:51.500
For that stinky security guard

19
00:00:52.566 --> 00:00:54.600
You are so pitiful!

20
00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.233
Although he is just an ordinary person

21
00:00:57.333 --> 00:00:59.500
But he was sincere to me

22
00:00:59.733 --> 00:01:02.666
And you just use me to hurt me
