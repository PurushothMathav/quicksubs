00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.566
Where can I get 10 people to humiliate me?

2
00:00:02.666 --> 00:00:04.433
This is too inexplicable

3
00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:07.100
And how ugly it would be if I was humiliated.

4
00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:08.166
Then continue

5
00:00:08.166 --> 00:00:10.166
I said I want to support you, didn't I want to support you?

6
00:00:10.166 --> 00:00:11.400
I saved you.

7
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.133
I didn't betray you at a critical time

8
00:00:14.133 --> 00:00:16.600
Aren't you touched?

9
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.800
Ah!

10
00:00:18.266 --> 00:00:19.866
Uh-huh.

11
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.300
I forgot I was powerful

12
00:00:26.333 --> 00:00:27.100
I warn you.

13
00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:27.866
Thinking about my money can

14
00:00:27.866 --> 00:00:29.166
Don't miss my people

15
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:33.666
Mr. Xu oops

16
00:00:33.666 --> 00:00:36.933
Mr. Huang, this time the party organized by Mr. Wang

17
00:00:36.933 --> 00:00:38.766
I would like to invite you to be my boyfriend

18
00:00:39.066 --> 00:00:41.733
But this kind of party of rich people

19
00:00:41.733 --> 00:00:43.200
I didn't go looking for humiliation

20
00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.400
Humiliation Today's task is humiliated by knowing people

21
00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.166
Reward an elixir

22
00:00:48.166 --> 00:00:49.300
You may not know

23
00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:50.800
Mr. Wang is the richest man

24
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.300
If you go, you can meet more partners.

25
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.700
This is only good for the company, not bad.

26
00:00:55.933 --> 00:00:57.866
If you are really afraid of his humiliation

27
00:00:57.866 --> 00:00:58.766
Hey no no no

28
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.366
I'm afraid they won't be humiliated.
