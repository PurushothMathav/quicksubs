00:00:01.066 --> 00:00:01.866
Zhang Qiang

2
00:00:02.333 --> 00:00:05.000
Did you just hit me with your right hand?

3
00:00:10.066 --> 00:00:12.233
Zhang Qiang, you are still a man

4
00:00:16.566 --> 00:00:20.033
Mr. Huang will lend you some more money to buy rough stones later.

5
00:00:20.333 --> 00:00:22.166
Why are you so professional?

6
00:00:22.166 --> 00:00:24.433
Just help me choose a few more stones later.

7
00:00:25.733 --> 00:00:28.566
Director Xu, er, brother

8
00:00:28.933 --> 00:00:32.266
I lost a lot when I bought two rocks just now.

9
00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.900
You see, I'm willing to admit defeat

10
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.233
Can you help me choose two pieces too?

11
00:00:38.966 --> 00:00:39.766
Ah!

12
00:00:40.566 --> 00:00:41.600
Brother Tao

13
00:00:42.533 --> 00:00:43.333
Mr. Huang

14
00:00:45.266 --> 00:00:48.100
Brother Tao, Brother Tao

15
00:00:48.166 --> 00:00:50.366
Brother Tao, I really didn't follow the wrong person

16
00:00:50.366 --> 00:00:51.833
Just turn around

17
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.600
The stones in here are worth at least 300 million.

18
00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.866
The hadrons are all from Mr. Huang, and the stones are chosen by me.

19
00:00:58.933 --> 00:01:01.066
So it's not that I can do without you

20
00:01:01.066 --> 00:01:03.666
That's right, you're a bag carrier

21
00:01:03.666 --> 00:01:04.900
He's not carrying his purse.

22
00:01:04.933 --> 00:01:07.066
I've already made an appointment to pick up these stones.

23
00:01:07.066 --> 00:01:08.366
Weirdly heavy

24
00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:10.566
Just wait for me here.

25
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.300
Chen Xuyao, you are with me

26
00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.166
Is there a new mission?
