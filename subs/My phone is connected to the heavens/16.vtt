00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:01.766
Dad, you don't have to be afraid of him

2
00:00:03.533 --> 00:00:06.866
For the sake of your father being a dog for me all his life

3
00:00:06.866 --> 00:00:08.200
Can let you go

4
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.033
Come here and lick it clean for me

5
00:00:12.266 --> 00:00:14.500
Mr. Wang

6
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.800
But I want to listen to Mr. Xu now

7
00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.600
I just bought a company this morning

8
00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:23.600
Why didn't anyone notify you?

9
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.066
Well, Mr. Xu has acquired the company today

10
00:00:27.066 --> 00:00:28.533
You've been fired.

11
00:00:28.533 --> 00:00:30.166
To move out of here as soon as possible

12
00:00:30.166 --> 00:00:32.300
Impossible Impossible

13
00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:35.233
Your company is only worth 100 million. That's cheap

14
00:00:37.466 --> 00:00:38.366
You lick me

15
00:00:39.366 --> 00:00:40.566
Detect danger to life

16
00:00:40.566 --> 00:00:42.366
In order to protect the safety of players

17
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.166
Early reward for mind reading once a day

18
00:00:45.266 --> 00:00:47.966
Xu Tao, you should be arrogant. Anyway, someone taught you a lesson.

19
00:00:47.966 --> 00:00:50.400
You and your dad won't survive tonight's mind reading

20
00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:53.100
Stop

21
00:00:53.766 --> 00:00:55.533
I wish my reward was Scud.

22
00:00:55.533 --> 00:00:57.400
This grandson runs so fast

23
00:00:57.533 --> 00:00:58.333
Mr. Xu

24
00:00:58.566 --> 00:01:01.766
Wang Kaisi, he asked me to his house to talk about work before

25
00:01:01.766 --> 00:01:02.900
I know his address

26
00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:07.666
This old man can't talk about work, the company is at home

27
00:01:09.366 --> 00:01:12.166
Son, what's going on?

28
00:01:12.166 --> 00:01:13.200
What Mr. Xu

29
00:01:13.266 --> 00:01:15.833
And why did Wang Kaisi run away?

30
00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.200
Xuetao, you are arrogant

31
00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:18.600
Anyway, someone taught you and your father a lesson

32
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.066
You and your father won't survive tonight

33
00:01:20.066 --> 00:01:20.533
Dad

34
00:01:20.533 --> 00:01:22.566
You must follow me today and can't go anywhere

35
00:01:22.566 --> 00:01:24.500
Secretary Li, please bring my little brother

36
00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.300
Go get Wang Kaisi back

37
00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.033
Why doesn't the family have such a rich and noble life?

38
00:01:31.466 --> 00:01:34.533
You kid, are you breaking the law?

39
00:01:34.533 --> 00:01:36.900
Father, why don't I have the life to take revenge?

40
00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.766
Times come and go, times come and go, have you heard of it?

41
00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.466
Hey, big brother, didn't find anyone?

42
00:01:46.333 --> 00:01:48.300
Is there really any adult?

43
00:01:48.333 --> 00:01:49.333
That's impossible.

44
00:01:49.333 --> 00:01:50.600
He must be talking nonsense.

45
00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.066
Anyway, I have King Kong not bad

46
00:01:52.066 --> 00:01:55.033
Tianwang Lao Tzu is here, I'm not afraid, etc., etc.
