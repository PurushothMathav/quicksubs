00:00:07.666 --> 00:00:09.800
Are you really good at it, or is it a mistake?

2
00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:12.266
I just learned a little skin from the TV show

3
00:00:13.133 --> 00:00:15.133
Also, if you really would

4
00:00:15.133 --> 00:00:16.733
Where is the need to be a small security guard?

5
00:00:16.733 --> 00:00:18.266
You've been gambling on stones for a long time

6
00:00:18.566 --> 00:00:19.866
That's not right.

7
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.766
Since you can get 80 million

8
00:00:22.766 --> 00:00:24.200
Why are you still a security guard?

9
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.700
To protect the company

10
00:00:30.166 --> 00:00:32.566
My daughter is waiting for this money! Help!

11
00:00:32.566 --> 00:00:34.733
Oops, that disease is a bottomless pit

12
00:00:34.733 --> 00:00:36.600
What about the follow-up treatment without gambling?

13
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.900
Our daughter can't live until the bet is right

14
00:00:40.866 --> 00:00:42.500
I suggest you don't buy this one

15
00:00:42.533 --> 00:00:43.400
Easy to suffer

16
00:00:44.166 --> 00:00:46.666
You, a security guard, are drinking my nonsense here

17
00:00:46.666 --> 00:00:48.200
The boss is looking at this piece

18
00:00:51.666 --> 00:00:53.500
Why don't you listen to good people?

19
00:00:54.166 --> 00:00:55.700
Why so small

20
00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:57.300
How is this possible?

21
00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:02.666
Without money, without money, our children's lives are gone

22
00:01:04.733 --> 00:01:06.733
Xu Tao blames you for saying those depressing words

23
00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:08.300
I started to fail at that time

24
00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:09.300
Hurry up

25
00:01:09.566 --> 00:01:11.966
Chen Xuyao, can you control your boyfriend?

26
00:01:11.966 --> 00:01:13.800
It was all about probability.

27
00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.666
I haven't even said him yet

28
00:01:15.666 --> 00:01:18.433
It's bad luck. It's bad luck for us.

29
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.600
Mr. Wang, I advise you

30
00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.533
Leave early with such people

31
00:01:22.533 --> 00:01:23.466
To avoid mischief

32
00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.000
You are with a broken security guard

33
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.533
No wonder the company is going out of business

34
00:01:27.533 --> 00:01:28.700
He was just talking nonsense.

35
00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.866
There was good stuff in that rock

36
00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:31.933
It's him talking nonsense

37
00:01:31.933 --> 00:01:33.566
Gone my good luck

38
00:01:36.766 --> 00:01:39.100
General dare to bet with me
