00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:01.166
Xu Tao

2
00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.466
Damn you, is this stinky security guard Wu Xiaoqiang's?

3
00:00:04.466 --> 00:00:07.066
It's okay, you can still come to gamble on stones

4
00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:09.666
Chen Xuyang, if I remember correctly

5
00:00:09.666 --> 00:00:11.266
It's working hours now, right?

6
00:00:11.266 --> 00:00:13.033
It was Mr. Huang

7
00:00:13.333 --> 00:00:15.733
Brother Qiang has already said that he wants to support me.

8
00:00:15.733 --> 00:00:18.133
I have quit this job

9
00:00:18.133 --> 00:00:18.866
Mr. Huang

10
00:00:18.866 --> 00:00:21.533
I heard that you are starting to lose your salary

11
00:00:21.533 --> 00:00:23.000
These rough stones?

12
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.733
Give it to me

13
00:00:24.733 --> 00:00:26.700
There's no good one for him anyway

14
00:00:26.933 --> 00:00:28.466
Don't talk nonsense

15
00:00:28.466 --> 00:00:31.100
I'm all good rocks

16
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.166
This stinky security guard knows nothing

17
00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:34.100
It's a fucking eyesore

18
00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.766
Get out of here, I've already ordered this batch of rough stones.

19
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.866
What do you want to book?

20
00:00:38.866 --> 00:00:40.700
You can't even pay your salary

21
00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.700
It's not a verbal reservation, is it?

22
00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:44.466
Ahahahaha

23
00:00:44.466 --> 00:00:45.500
So fucking funny

24
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.100
If the emperor believes me, I will let you

25
00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:52.900
Ahahaha

26
00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:56.466
Boss this

27
00:00:56.866 --> 00:00:58.366
Please don't deceive me.

28
00:00:58.366 --> 00:01:00.366
Hey, I will cheat.

29
00:01:00.366 --> 00:01:01.433
No no no no

30
00:01:01.466 --> 00:01:03.100
Is that your famous hand kiss?

31
00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:04.666
It's exactly the same as a knife down.

32
00:01:04.666 --> 00:01:06.700
It won't be cut. It's too far.

33
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.200
Didn't I tell you to get out?

34
00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.800
Talk nonsense again, be careful I'll pull out your tongue

35
00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.666
But the original has been given to you

36
00:01:13.666 --> 00:01:15.766
Whether it is good or bad has nothing to do with us

37
00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:17.166
Come on.

38
00:01:17.166 --> 00:01:19.433
I'm still waiting to see him regret it

39
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:20.500
Cut in two

40
00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.266
Adding my ancestral heritage back to my legs started three generations

41
00:01:23.266 --> 00:01:24.500
How could there be a deviation?

42
00:01:24.566 --> 00:01:26.366
You are the eighteenth generation of ancestors

43
00:01:26.366 --> 00:01:28.400
It's not as good as my headgear

44
00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.800
Xue Tao, you are so arrogant and talkative

45
00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:33.866
So annoying

46
00:01:33.866 --> 00:01:36.066
No wonder you've been a stinky security guard all your life

47
00:01:36.533 --> 00:01:39.166
Your dog spit ivory out of his mouth, get out of here

48
00:01:39.366 --> 00:01:41.033
Don't be annoying here

49
00:01:45.333 --> 00:01:47.200
How did you mess with such a little shrew?

50
00:01:48.133 --> 00:01:49.100
Ah!

51
00:01:50.066 --> 00:01:51.233
How could this be?

52
00:01:51.466 --> 00:01:54.366
I have clearly calculated it, and it will not be wrong.

53
00:01:54.366 --> 00:01:56.733
How dare you lie to me?

54
00:01:56.733 --> 00:01:58.333
The rough stone that Lao Tzu bought at a high price

55
00:01:58.333 --> 00:02:00.200
A bunch of big money for you to drive

56
00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.900
You have to pay me
