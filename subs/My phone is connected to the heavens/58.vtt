00:00:04.666 --> 00:00:07.266
Damn, is this a dying hallucination?

2
00:00:07.266 --> 00:00:08.966
I am a fairy from heaven

3
00:00:08.966 --> 00:00:10.433
Specially to help you

4
00:00:10.733 --> 00:00:12.133
You fairy

5
00:00:12.133 --> 00:00:14.600
Yes, I was called by the heavens.

6
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:17.633
Come to the world to help you regain the task of changing times

7
00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:18.933
So I don't have to die?

8
00:00:18.933 --> 00:00:20.766
Zhao Zixuan also got the system

9
00:00:20.766 --> 00:00:22.100
But it doesn't come and go.

10
00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:23.533
It's a pirated system.

11
00:00:23.533 --> 00:00:25.466
There are pirated copies of this stuff

12
00:00:25.466 --> 00:00:27.366
Yes, we depend on time.

13
00:00:27.366 --> 00:00:29.200
To screen candidates for immortality

14
00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:30.133
Over the years

15
00:00:30.133 --> 00:00:32.766
The Demon Realm has been interfering with the material selection plan of the Heaven Realm

16
00:00:32.766 --> 00:00:33.300
They are private

17
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.766
Since mixing up a lot of seedlings with the potential to become immortals

18
00:00:35.766 --> 00:00:38.033
As a result, the celestial world is now pro-yellow and does not accept it.

19
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.933
So it's all the work of the devil

20
00:00:40.933 --> 00:00:44.033
Well, the piracy system focuses on harming others and self-interest

21
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.000
They manipulate the piracy system

22
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.966
Let the controller do things for them

23
00:00:47.966 --> 00:00:49.366
Satisfy their selfish desires

24
00:00:49.366 --> 00:00:50.600
As far as I know

25
00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.166
Those people didn't end well

26
00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.266
Then can you help me?

27
00:00:54.266 --> 00:00:55.166
Give me some power

28
00:00:55.166 --> 00:00:56.900
Or just make me a god or something

29
00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:59.533
We can't use magic to help you.

30
00:00:59.533 --> 00:01:01.900
But I can help you get the system back.

31
00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:04.366
In order to complete the tasks given to you by the system

32
00:01:04.366 --> 00:01:05.266
For yourself

33
00:01:05.266 --> 00:01:06.966
And to save the world
