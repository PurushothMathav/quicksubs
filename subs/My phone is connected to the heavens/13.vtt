00:00:00.466 --> 00:00:03.000
Brother, I just reminisced about it.

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.466
You are the first person in the world to protect me like this

3
00:00:06.533 --> 00:00:10.000
It's what it feels like to be protected

4
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.166
Hey, hey, hey.

5
00:00:14.866 --> 00:00:18.266
Who threw such a large lump of gold on the ground?

6
00:00:18.266 --> 00:00:19.066
big brother

7
00:00:19.166 --> 00:00:22.000
Why does this gold look like a piece of shit?

8
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.400
Hahaha, go away.

9
00:00:24.866 --> 00:00:25.800
Ok bro

10
00:00:25.933 --> 00:00:28.166
Come over today and I'll tell you.

11
00:00:28.166 --> 00:00:30.366
I, Zhang Qiang, will mix with you in the future

12
00:00:30.366 --> 00:00:32.466
Not for money, just for one

13
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:33.833
Here we go.

14
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.366
How heavy is that?

15
00:00:41.266 --> 00:00:43.266
What's the matter? Are you surprised?

16
00:00:44.966 --> 00:00:47.233
I heard that Mr. Huang gave you 100 million yuan.

17
00:00:47.766 --> 00:00:49.500
Ouch so affectionate

18
00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:50.766
Xiao Di's wife can't be bullied

19
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.300
Zhang Qiang is already your boyfriend

20
00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:54.466
I broke up with him.

21
00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:57.900
Master, hurry up

22
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.200
Brother Tao Brother Tao

23
00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.700
Brother Tao, oops

24
00:01:04.766 --> 00:01:06.800
I've never seen you so proactive

25
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.500
Maybe I'm too attractive.

26
00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.000
Since the establishment of this system

27
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.400
I don't know what the next task is

28
00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.933
But it's been a fulfilling life

29
00:01:13.933 --> 00:01:15.266
What are you doing?

30
00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:16.566
Isn't it obvious?

31
00:01:16.566 --> 00:01:18.766
What about the security guard? Now the security guard has been posted upside down.

32
00:01:18.766 --> 00:01:20.000
Why why?

33
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.033
Because I see gold as dung
