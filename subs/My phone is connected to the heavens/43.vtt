1
00:00:01.933 --> 00:00:03.033
That's a good word.

2
00:00:03.133 --> 00:00:05.266
This should be a treasure from the early Qing Dynasty.

3
00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:06.466
This body is round

4
00:00:06.466 --> 00:00:07.466
Must be thin and light

5
00:00:07.466 --> 00:00:09.033
It's a good baby

6
00:00:13.066 --> 00:00:16.133
Only the first of your 10 treasures is more valuable.

7
00:00:16.133 --> 00:00:18.900
These two pieces are common porcelain in the late Qing Dynasty

8
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.466
Everything else is fake

9
00:00:20.466 --> 00:00:21.333
worthless

10
00:00:21.333 --> 00:00:22.533
But it's already great

11
00:00:22.533 --> 00:00:25.000
This shows that you have done your homework on Qing Dynasty relics

12
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:26.566
Why are there only 3 pieces?

13
00:00:26.566 --> 00:00:28.133
Those people tricked me into selling antiques

14
00:00:28.133 --> 00:00:29.166
How can you believe them?

15
00:00:29.166 --> 00:00:30.800
Escape on your own

16
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.066
It's time to see mine

17
00:00:33.066 --> 00:00:36.200
Are you babies trying to test my level?

18
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.533
This is the treasure of the Tang Dynasty

19
00:00:42.533 --> 00:00:43.666
This tone is warm

20
00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:45.000
This craftsmanship is exquisite

21
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.300
Elegant shape

22
00:00:46.366 --> 00:00:47.666
Where did you escape, baby?

23
00:00:47.666 --> 00:00:49.166
Can you sell him to me?

24
00:00:49.333 --> 00:00:50.800
Please look at the second one first.

25
00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:53.600
Is this a bigger baby?

26
00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.200
Is that a noun?

27
00:00:56.133 --> 00:00:57.433
These are all genuine.

28
00:00:57.466 --> 00:00:59.066
It's worth billions.

29
00:00:59.066 --> 00:01:00.533
Can you sell me a few pieces?

30
00:01:00.533 --> 00:01:01.966
No, one will do.

31
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.566
I will pay all the price.

32
00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.333
If you can't afford it alone

33
00:01:06.333 --> 00:01:08.033
It is also possible to call your friend.

34
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.166
How is it, big nephew?

35
00:01:10.266 --> 00:01:11.866
Why don't you kneel down and beg me

36
00:01:11.866 --> 00:01:13.666
I'll consider not taking your

37
00:01:14.266 --> 00:01:15.566
Li San's true feelings

38
00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:16.533
One more game

39
00:01:16.533 --> 00:01:18.166
Young master, absolutely not

40
00:01:18.166 --> 00:01:20.166
These were bought at a high price just now.

41
00:01:20.166 --> 00:01:21.766
It's all lost now.

42
00:01:21.766 --> 00:01:23.133
Your account is overdrawn.

43
00:01:23.133 --> 00:01:25.200
Now you have an account with your company.

44
00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:29.833
What's wrong, sir?
