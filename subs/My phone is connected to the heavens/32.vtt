00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:01.700
Say you are my place

2
00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:03.466
Shouldn't I be here?

3
00:00:03.466 --> 00:00:06.666
So you want to kill me?

4
00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:09.233
Hey, everyone is there

5
00:00:09.566 --> 00:00:11.200
It's you who sacrifice your life for money

6
00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.100
How could I have killed you?

7
00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:17.266
A mere 100 million will make you die for money?

8
00:00:17.266 --> 00:00:20.300
Well, it really doesn't work. You can be my little brother

9
00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:21.600
Be my watchdog

10
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.700
I happen to remember your ancestors

11
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:26.033
Three generations of security guards

12
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:27.366
Leaf Specialization

13
00:00:27.533 --> 00:00:29.900
How about I give you 100 million a month?

14
00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:30.833
Zhao Zixuan

15
00:00:30.866 --> 00:00:33.500
Don't go too far. How can I go too far?

16
00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.566
I'm just looking for a job for your little white face

17
00:00:36.566 --> 00:00:38.466
Everyone, judge, no

18
00:00:38.466 --> 00:00:39.666
Zhao Zixuan

19
00:00:40.266 --> 00:00:43.266
The most important thing is money

20
00:00:43.266 --> 00:00:44.066
money

21
00:00:44.666 --> 00:00:45.633
Wow

22
00:00:46.533 --> 00:00:48.800
Hmph, do you think I'm short of money?

23
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.966
Only people like you who do nothing every day

24
00:00:50.966 --> 00:00:52.333
Money is on my mind

25
00:00:52.333 --> 00:00:53.633
What are you missing?

26
00:00:53.733 --> 00:00:55.766
Missing the woman I don't want, right?

27
00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.366
Xu Tao, let's go

28
00:00:58.366 --> 00:00:59.400
I don't want to be here.

29
00:01:00.466 --> 00:01:02.266
Why do you say you are in pain?

30
00:01:02.266 --> 00:01:05.700
Xu Tao, is it fun to pick up the trash I don't want?

31
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.733
Yes, I found a treasure.

32
00:01:07.733 --> 00:01:09.666
By the way, thank you for giving it to me.

33
00:01:13.466 --> 00:01:16.566
Stupid white paper, you want you too

34
00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:20.900
Mr. Zhao can't afford this

35
00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:22.066
Lost dead

36
00:01:22.066 --> 00:01:23.200
No money if you win

37
00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.000
You think we're here for fun?

38
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.000
Xu Tao

39
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.266
Can you stop hiding behind women all the time?

40
00:01:28.266 --> 00:01:28.666
Ah!

41
00:01:28.666 --> 00:01:31.666
I am Brother Tao's woman, which represents Brother Tao

42
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.666
Of course the loser is not qualified to talk to him

43
00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.933
OK, give them the money.

44
00:01:36.933 --> 00:01:38.000
Let them go!

45
00:01:44.566 --> 00:01:45.700
You go get it

46
00:01:46.366 --> 00:01:48.033
I'm dead meat.
