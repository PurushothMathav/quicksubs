1
00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.300
Be careful

2
00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:05.233
Wait, wait, wait. It doesn't hurt

3
00:00:06.866 --> 00:00:08.900
This is my completion to get the reward King Kong does not change.

4
00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:10.466
King Kong doesn't change it, call me.

5
00:00:12.066 --> 00:00:15.000
The aunts who take a bath in the bathhouse hurt more than you adults

6
00:00:17.333 --> 00:00:20.166
The cost of the rough stone planing just now netted 300 million

7
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:23.066
50/50, that's 150 million.

8
00:00:23.566 --> 00:00:24.933
As for the money I owe you

9
00:00:24.933 --> 00:00:26.333
I'll give it to you when I turn it around.

10
00:00:26.333 --> 00:00:28.400
Hey, no need, it's all small money.

11
00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.300
This system is too awesome

12
00:00:36.266 --> 00:00:38.800
But I sacrificed so much today

13
00:00:39.666 --> 00:00:41.900
Is there any hidden reward?

14
00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.666
Today's task is even more difficult

15
00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.100
The event reward turns a stone into gold once

16
00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:49.033
I really think about it

17
00:00:49.366 --> 00:00:52.100
Then I should turn my house into gold

18
00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:54.433
But the house is rented.

19
00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:56.366
What am I good at?

20
00:00:56.533 --> 00:00:58.100
Big brother haha

21
00:01:02.866 --> 00:01:03.666
Ah!
