00:00:00.733 --> 00:00:02.700
I've already called him and his father

2
00:00:02.733 --> 00:00:04.100
Are you still doing it tonight?

3
00:00:04.266 --> 00:00:06.700
I told you not to startle the snake after you find him

4
00:00:06.766 --> 00:00:07.966
Dispose of it quietly

5
00:00:07.966 --> 00:00:09.266
Now he's on guard.

6
00:00:09.933 --> 00:00:11.066
Just wait.

7
00:00:11.066 --> 00:00:12.633
But you promised me

8
00:00:13.266 --> 00:00:15.200
Reward for completing tasks

9
00:00:22.933 --> 00:00:24.500
Get rid of the time-to-run APP.

10
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.533
The owner and all their immediate family members

11
00:00:26.533 --> 00:00:27.466
Avoid future troubles

12
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.400
Reward immortality

13
00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:34.200
Mr. Wang, why didn't you come?

14
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.800
It turned out to be Mr. Xu

15
00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:37.000
Mr. Xu

16
00:00:37.066 --> 00:00:40.000
I don't want our two companies to join forces?

17
00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.100
After all, I have feelings for the company

18
00:00:42.366 --> 00:00:43.866
Let's go to my office

19
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.200
That's what it feels like to be a boss

20
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.400
Today's task is to find a girlfriend

21
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.100
Get the powerful sky

22
00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:53.000
It's time for this mission

23
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.533
It doesn't matter if he rewards or not.

24
00:00:54.533 --> 00:00:56.833
Let me experience what it's like to be in love first

25
00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:59.533
What do I want today?

26
00:00:59.533 --> 00:01:01.666
Mengqi must be hard not to fall in love with me

27
00:01:01.733 --> 00:01:04.000
Mr. Xu, this is

28
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:05.566
Muse

29
00:01:06.333 --> 00:01:08.133
Ah, Mr. Xu

30
00:01:08.133 --> 00:01:10.000
I have arranged for your father

31
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.466
The younger brother is guarding every inch by the side

32
00:01:12.466 --> 00:01:14.300
I also sent people to find Wang Kais

33
00:01:14.333 --> 00:01:15.966
It's okay, don't go to him.

34
00:01:16.466 --> 00:01:18.400
He must have had to yesterday

35
00:01:18.766 --> 00:01:22.833
Oh, how did you fall in love with me?

36
00:01:22.933 --> 00:01:25.300
Me? Yeah.

37
00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.500
Although I was very grateful for your call 9 yesterday.

38
00:01:28.533 --> 00:01:29.700
You are also my boss

39
00:01:29.933 --> 00:01:32.033
But I think we still need to get to know each other

40
00:01:32.566 --> 00:01:34.900
You speak louder. I didn't hear a word

41
00:01:35.066 --> 00:01:37.800
I think we should start by dating

42
00:01:38.333 --> 00:01:39.733
Where do you want to date?

43
00:01:39.733 --> 00:01:42.266
Well, how about the restaurant?

44
00:01:42.533 --> 00:01:44.866
OK, then you can book a 7 o'clock tomorrow night

45
00:01:44.866 --> 00:01:46.366
Just follow your aesthetic.

46
00:01:46.733 --> 00:01:47.866
Money is not a problem
