00:00:00.733 --> 00:00:03.233
Brother, why don't you play stone gambling?

2
00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:04.866
Start playing some curios

3
00:00:04.866 --> 00:00:07.000
The water is deep here

4
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.033
Deeper water

5
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:10.033
The young master can also see through it at a glance

6
00:00:11.266 --> 00:00:13.200
There are all the oldest of these antiques.

7
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.166
In the Tang Dynasty

8
00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:16.100
Wouldn't I make a lot of money by buying it?

9
00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:17.733
This this this oops

10
00:00:17.733 --> 00:00:18.366
Catch me

11
00:00:18.366 --> 00:00:19.766
He's a cheerful man.

12
00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.366
Brother, I'll buy it now.

13
00:00:22.366 --> 00:00:25.366
This is too sloppy, I like it

14
00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:29.033
You have to know that these treasures are priceless

15
00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:30.833
I see you can still laugh

16
00:00:37.733 --> 00:00:41.033
Brother, why do you still want to buy this?

17
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:45.600
Hey nephew

18
00:00:46.366 --> 00:00:47.300
Let's make a bet

19
00:00:47.666 --> 00:00:49.366
Bet on antiques

20
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.700
Whoever buys with a high value wins

21
00:00:51.866 --> 00:00:52.866
If you win

22
00:00:52.866 --> 00:00:54.133
I will never see you again

23
00:00:54.133 --> 00:00:56.533
If you lose, all the antiques you buy go to me

24
00:00:56.533 --> 00:00:57.966
How about a deal?

25
00:00:58.066 --> 00:01:01.166
So let's start buying 10 antiques each.

26
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.600
Buy it and meet in the lobby at the intersection ahead.

27
00:01:03.866 --> 00:01:05.266
Find an appraiser for appraisal
