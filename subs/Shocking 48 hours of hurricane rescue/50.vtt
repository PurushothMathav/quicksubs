00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:06.766
Shit, we've already looked for this

2
00:00:06.766 --> 00:00:07.766
Play us

3
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:09.500
I just brought you to find

4
00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:11.133
Where they might go

5
00:00:11.133 --> 00:00:12.700
I don't know where they are

6
00:00:12.733 --> 00:00:14.666
What are you hitting me for?

7
00:00:14.666 --> 00:00:15.266
All day

8
00:00:15.266 --> 00:00:17.466
Time wasted on them both

9
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:19.266
Let's look elsewhere

10
00:00:19.666 --> 00:00:20.800
Where else could they go?

11
00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:22.300
The park is so big

12
00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:24.366
May have already run away

13
00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:30.433
Let's go first

14
00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.400
Mengmeng hasn't come yet, wait a minute

15
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:33.300
Wait a minute.

16
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.700
We still have to wait for Mengmeng's colleague to pick us up.

17
00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:36.700
Let's go first

18
00:00:36.766 --> 00:00:39.066
If we don't go, none of us will live

19
00:00:49.366 --> 00:00:50.833
I can't go, Brother Jun

20
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:52.966
You go first

21
00:00:52.966 --> 00:00:53.966
I can hold you back

22
00:00:53.966 --> 00:00:56.033
No, no, for you.

23
00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:02.766
We can't escape

24
00:01:02.766 --> 00:01:03.400
You listen to me.

25
00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:04.266
I have a plan.

26
00:01:04.366 --> 00:01:05.366
You tell them

27
00:01:05.366 --> 00:01:07.033
I was thrown into a mass grave

28
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.300
So what did you do?

29
00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:09.666
Yeah.

30
00:01:09.666 --> 00:01:12.166
Another Tiantian was taken away by someone from Master Jiu Qin

31
00:01:12.266 --> 00:01:13.466
As long as you can live

32
00:01:13.466 --> 00:01:15.300
You will definitely save them, right?

33
00:01:15.466 --> 00:01:16.600
But Brother Jun

34
00:01:18.666 --> 00:01:19.366
It's too late.

35
00:01:19.366 --> 00:01:21.000
I will definitely let you live
