00:00:03.166 --> 00:00:05.066
Where are you going?

2
00:00:05.133 --> 00:00:08.133
I'm not running away, am I?

3
00:00:08.133 --> 00:00:09.566
Forgive others, forgive others

4
00:00:09.566 --> 00:00:10.966
I really had to this time

5
00:00:10.966 --> 00:00:12.600
If I don't go, I'm going to die here

6
00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:15.733
Do you really think you can escape?

7
00:00:15.733 --> 00:00:18.600
Your ID card and passport are all in Fei Ge's hands

8
00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:21.333
Even if you escape to the border, I will catch you back

9
00:00:21.333 --> 00:00:22.700
That's better than dying here

10
00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:24.100
You put me down and I won't let you go

11
00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:25.766
Come with me to see Sister Hong

12
00:00:31.066 --> 00:00:33.633
Okay, Brother Fei, look at what you've done

13
00:00:34.066 --> 00:00:34.966
He fooled me

14
00:00:34.966 --> 00:00:35.766
Phineas

15
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.366
Stand by and enter

16
00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:42.100
Without further ado

17
00:00:42.266 --> 00:00:44.200
It will be delivered to Young Master Lin tonight to die

18
00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:45.766
Hmm, Sister Soul

19
00:00:45.766 --> 00:00:46.966
You all saw

20
00:00:46.966 --> 00:00:48.266
The St. Donna line has escaped

21
00:00:48.266 --> 00:00:50.200
I'm trying to catch him, I'm really

22
00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:51.866
Do you know who Cai Maomao is?

23
00:00:51.866 --> 00:00:53.466
He's a reporter for the Evening Faith

24
00:00:53.466 --> 00:00:56.433
Specially lurking in to expose your nonsense

25
00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:59.700
The king has you, look

26
00:01:00.333 --> 00:01:01.566
Fei Ge promised me

27
00:01:01.566 --> 00:01:03.766
After this is done, I will be a shareholder of the company

28
00:01:03.766 --> 00:01:06.666
I can't match a little girl liar, is it okay?

29
00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:09.666
The stinky girl lied to me for so long

30
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.500
Sister Hong, trust me, I'll shut up

31
00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.666
Go away, Hu
