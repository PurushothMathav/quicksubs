00:00:02.166 --> 00:00:04.900
Can you put me down before you can say it?

2
00:00:06.266 --> 00:00:08.100
I don't know about Fei Ge

3
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:10.400
But Fei Ge is really special to Luna

4
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.666
I'm not even angry to hang out with Ah Jun

5
00:00:12.666 --> 00:00:14.233
Tell me about it.

6
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:15.833
as

7
00:00:16.933 --> 00:00:18.233
Deal with it

8
00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.066
Anyway, Fei Ge's freshness didn't last long

9
00:00:21.066 --> 00:00:22.800
Let's take advantage of Fei Ge's absence

10
00:00:23.166 --> 00:00:25.500
It doesn't work if it's buried.

11
00:00:25.533 --> 00:00:27.600
This company is full of Phineas

12
00:00:27.866 --> 00:00:30.366
Not to mention whether anyone is willing to help you

13
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.100
Are you not afraid that Brother Fei will come back to settle accounts with you?

14
00:00:33.366 --> 00:00:35.266
So what can you do?

15
00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:45.833
Think about it.

16
00:00:49.766 --> 00:00:51.666
The newcomers all listen to Sister Hong's lectures

17
00:00:51.666 --> 00:00:53.733
Get up get up get up

18
00:00:53.733 --> 00:00:55.166
Hurry up, you two!

19
00:00:56.466 --> 00:00:58.933
Hey, okay, Brother Bao, hurry up.

20
00:00:58.933 --> 00:01:00.066
back-and-forth

21
00:01:00.266 --> 00:01:01.300
Fiberhome Kiln

22
00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:02.866
Have you heard?

23
00:01:03.466 --> 00:01:04.433
Nope.

24
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.400
Mengmeng Thousand Doors Eight Generals?

25
00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:08.666
Our grandfather

26
00:01:08.666 --> 00:01:13.233
That's right, what I'm going to talk about today is the eight generals of a thousand doors

27
00:01:13.333 --> 00:01:14.633
The so-called general

28
00:01:14.666 --> 00:01:16.800
It's the person involved in Qianshu's opening

29
00:01:16.933 --> 00:01:20.166
Facing the customer's greed and fear head-on

30
00:01:21.166 --> 00:01:22.066
Secondly

31
00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:23.766
Is the general

32
00:01:24.366 --> 00:01:25.766
Responsible for pulling people into the game

33
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:27.133
Make up conversation scripts

34
00:01:27.133 --> 00:01:29.166
Sister Hong, I have studied English before

35
00:01:29.166 --> 00:01:30.333
Can I do this?

36
00:01:30.333 --> 00:01:32.666
I will consider the performance 5 million

37
00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.900
Then came the anti-generals

38
00:01:37.333 --> 00:01:38.133
Here you go.

39
00:01:39.133 --> 00:01:42.766
This is our popular anti-general

40
00:01:43.733 --> 00:01:45.766
Miss Luna?

41
00:01:46.066 --> 00:01:48.400
Responsible for selling hue

42
00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.666
Provide customers with insider information and emotional value

43
00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.100
The person most trusted by customers

44
00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:59.200
Hey

45
00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:01.466
What are you hiding?
