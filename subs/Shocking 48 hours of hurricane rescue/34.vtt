00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:06.700
Hey

2
00:00:07.566 --> 00:00:08.766
What are you hiding?

3
00:00:09.966 --> 00:00:11.600
Nothing for me

4
00:00:13.866 --> 00:00:15.000
Take it out

5
00:00:20.266 --> 00:00:23.866
Hahahahaha

6
00:00:23.933 --> 00:00:25.233
Oh, dear.

7
00:00:25.766 --> 00:00:27.000
Just started work

8
00:00:27.766 --> 00:00:29.300
Are you so serious?

9
00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:32.900
Then I should praise you.

10
00:00:33.666 --> 00:00:35.033
What are you hiding?

11
00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:37.200
I was scared.

12
00:00:37.733 --> 00:00:38.533
Ah!

13
00:00:38.766 --> 00:00:39.633
Stinky lady

14
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.433
Don't give me a goddamn pitiful look

15
00:00:42.466 --> 00:00:44.700
I won't eat if the dog eats you

16
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.266
I'll tell you what.

17
00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:48.666
I'll give you this line of electric fried.

18
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.066
I have to be torn up, do you hear me?

19
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:55.466
I heard it louder I heard it

20
00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:59.900
Do you want to piss off Sister Hong?

21
00:01:05.966 --> 00:01:07.400
Uh it's alright it's alright

22
00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:08.500
Keep working.

23
00:01:10.733 --> 00:01:12.500
Ahhh

24
00:01:13.133 --> 00:01:14.166
Tell you

25
00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.066
No matter how selfish you are

26
00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.266
Can't do business here

27
00:01:20.666 --> 00:01:22.133
This is the end

28
00:01:22.133 --> 00:01:23.300
Do you understand?

29
00:01:23.733 --> 00:01:26.100
Forgive you or not, I won't dare again.

30
00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.833
You get it. And

31
00:01:30.733 --> 00:01:32.366
Put away your tricks

32
00:01:33.166 --> 00:01:34.766
I have admired you the cutest

33
00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.000
Otherwise your pretty face

34
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:39.866
Ah!

35
00:01:41.733 --> 00:01:42.533
Ah!

36
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.066
Go to hell, Hong

37
00:01:45.166 --> 00:01:45.933
back-and-forth

38
00:01:45.933 --> 00:01:48.266
I understand what it means to send the beacon fire out of the kiln.

39
00:01:48.366 --> 00:01:50.200
Then I will continue the class tomorrow.

40
00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:57.866
Are you all right?

41
00:01:59.533 --> 00:02:02.700
It's okay, it's almost numb
