He can't die even if you die

2
00:00:05.666 --> 00:00:09.066
Hahahaha, a group of people came outside.

3
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:11.666
Take the gun off

4
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:13.433
Go have a look

5
00:00:17.466 --> 00:00:19.066
The black fish is not dead

6
00:00:24.466 --> 00:00:26.766
Over to you hehehe

7
00:00:29.266 --> 00:00:30.766
Positioning is on our side

8
00:00:32.133 --> 00:00:34.433
They have guns and are more prepared than us

9
00:00:36.466 --> 00:00:37.766
How do you know the facts?

10
00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:44.800
Hey, what are you doing?

11
00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:45.600
let in

12
00:00:46.533 --> 00:00:48.133
Brother, what is this place?

13
00:00:48.133 --> 00:00:49.300
Let's go in and have a look

14
00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:50.800
What are you doing?

15
00:00:53.333 --> 00:00:54.600
It's okay to wander around

16
00:00:55.533 --> 00:00:56.366
wander around

17
00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.566
Do you know where this is?

18
00:00:58.566 --> 00:00:59.466
Ah!

19
00:01:00.566 --> 00:01:01.833
Get out of here

20
00:01:02.166 --> 00:01:03.700
What if I don't get out?

21
00:01:04.466 --> 00:01:08.033
Hey bro, I'm in the wrong place, I'm in the wrong place

22
00:01:09.666 --> 00:01:11.166
Don't be impulsive, I have to go first

23
00:01:11.166 --> 00:01:12.333
There must be something wrong here

24
00:01:12.333 --> 00:01:13.266
Come back later.

25
00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:14.966
Can't let my brother take the risk

26
00:01:15.166 --> 00:01:17.366
Go, go, no delivery, no delivery.
