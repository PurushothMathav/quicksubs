00:00:02.266 --> 00:00:03.466
Let's run away together

2
00:00:06.566 --> 00:00:08.700
I will definitely bring them to justice

3
00:00:08.866 --> 00:00:10.666
My wife was injured by them

4
00:00:10.933 --> 00:00:12.333
The foreman committed suicide by jumping off a building

5
00:00:12.333 --> 00:00:14.433
All my co-workers they

6
00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:19.200
Hey, over 30 million

7
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.266
You know this is for us migrant workers

8
00:00:21.266 --> 00:00:22.466
Does it mean anything?

9
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.666
I can understand how you feel.

10
00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.266
I'll figure it out.

11
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.700
But you must pay attention to safety.

12
00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:31.466
Don't worry, I just don't want this life

13
00:00:31.733 --> 00:00:32.966
It will also keep you safe

14
00:00:34.133 --> 00:00:36.100
What are you two doing sneaking around here?

15
00:00:36.266 --> 00:00:37.066
Brother Bao

16
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.366
Luna has some professional words that she doesn't quite understand.

17
00:00:39.366 --> 00:00:40.700
I'm giving him make-up lessons

18
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.266
Playing a big knife in front of Guan Gong

19
00:00:43.266 --> 00:00:45.900
Come with me to see Brother Fei, Brother Bao

20
00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:51.500
Fei Ge, I'm really asking him a question.

21
00:00:51.733 --> 00:00:53.300
Yeah, you have to trust us.

22
00:00:53.333 --> 00:00:54.666
I'm here to help you make money.

23
00:00:54.666 --> 00:00:56.400
Why would I touch your woman?

24
00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.066
Get this shit out of here

25
00:00:58.066 --> 00:00:59.233
I don't want to see him again.

26
00:00:59.933 --> 00:01:01.566
I was wrong. I was wrong.

27
00:01:02.133 --> 00:01:04.566
I don't dare anymore Fei Ge, I don't need to know the truth

28
00:01:04.566 --> 00:01:06.266
You are alone in the same room

29
00:01:06.266 --> 00:01:07.600
What would other people think?

30
00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:08.900
What else do you explain?

31
00:01:09.166 --> 00:01:10.833
Since Fei Ge doesn't believe me

32
00:01:11.766 --> 00:01:13.766
Then I can only be cut off with death

33
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.233
Your life

34
00:01:15.766 --> 00:01:17.500
Only I have the final say

35
00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.600
Fei, please let me go

36
00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.366
Fei, please let me go

37
00:01:28.366 --> 00:01:30.766
Fei Ge, I am the strange Fei Ge

38
00:01:31.066 --> 00:01:32.566
Fei Ge Fei Ge

39
00:01:32.566 --> 00:01:35.200
Don't that A Yan has been taught a lesson by me
