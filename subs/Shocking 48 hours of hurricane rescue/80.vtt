1
00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:08.433
If you are willing to do as I say

2
00:00:08.933 --> 00:00:09.466
I promise.

3
00:00:09.466 --> 00:00:11.200
You can be honored with a heroic gesture

4
00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:11.500
Go

5
00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:13.300
I can also make you the interim group media manager

6
00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:14.533
The income will not be less than here.

7
00:00:14.533 --> 00:00:16.166
But ten times safer

8
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.066
Why should I believe you?

9
00:00:18.366 --> 00:00:19.766
Then I can do it now

10
00:00:20.566 --> 00:00:21.566
What do you want?

11
00:00:21.666 --> 00:00:22.700
Help!

12
00:00:22.766 --> 00:00:24.700
Up and down here are people of friendship

13
00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:26.000
It's no use shouting again

14
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:28.800
What are you still doing with me at this point?

15
00:00:30.266 --> 00:00:31.700
The two children are gone

16
00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:32.900
It must be Fei Ge

17
00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:34.800
Then you go to Fei Ge

18
00:00:34.866 --> 00:00:35.866
It's useless to find me

19
00:00:35.866 --> 00:00:37.333
Sister Hong still believes in you

20
00:00:37.333 --> 00:00:39.966
If you follow Sister Hong, you will definitely know the bottom of the child.

21
00:00:39.966 --> 00:00:41.866
And you believed that I could help you?

22
00:00:42.266 --> 00:00:43.400
I don't believe you.

23
00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.166
But I believe in your greed and survival instincts

24
00:00:49.166 --> 00:00:51.366
That female reporter killed you at home

25
00:00:51.366 --> 00:00:52.300
Just let him go

26
00:00:53.166 --> 00:00:55.533
Those two children are probably in the hands of Fei Ge

27
00:00:55.533 --> 00:00:56.800
I talked to him about the terms

28
00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:57.633
He will help

29
00:01:04.366 --> 00:01:05.700
What are you doing back here?

30
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.100
Sister Hong is kind to me

31
00:01:08.566 --> 00:01:10.766
I can't watch Sister Hong have an accident.

32
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.800
Humph

33
00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:13.833
What else can you do?

34
00:01:15.566 --> 00:01:17.366
I'm an undercover reporter

35
00:01:17.533 --> 00:01:20.133
After leaving the customs, there is an international pass.

36
00:01:20.133 --> 00:01:21.433
Move freely

37
00:01:21.566 --> 00:01:24.100
When the time comes, Sister Hong will share my share

38
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.100
My hard work is not in vain

39
00:01:28.466 --> 00:01:29.666
I warn you.

40
00:01:29.766 --> 00:01:31.966
I'll kill you if you dare to play any tricks
