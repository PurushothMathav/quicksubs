00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:01.700
Oops Jianhua

2
00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:03.066
You have to be careful next time

3
00:00:03.133 --> 00:00:04.866
Don't fall off the top of the river again

4
00:00:04.866 --> 00:00:07.466
It's a broken head and cracked ribs

5
00:00:07.466 --> 00:00:08.566
You have to recover

6
00:00:08.566 --> 00:00:10.366
You can't continue to earn centimeters

7
00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.066
Let him destroy Ning Yuan

8
00:00:12.066 --> 00:00:14.700
Didn't Wang Jianhua, this trash, succeed?

9
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.000
Wang Jianhua is injured

10
00:00:16.066 --> 00:00:18.200
The centimeter of the disease price is only 3 a day

11
00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.133
We have more work to do to help him make up for it.

12
00:00:20.133 --> 00:00:21.966
Otherwise, at the end of the year, the grain will be divided into centimeters

13
00:00:21.966 --> 00:00:22.966
Centimeters are not enough

14
00:00:22.966 --> 00:00:24.366
We're all going to be dragged down

15
00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:26.766
Okay.

16
00:00:26.766 --> 00:00:29.333
We have to take food to see Wang Jianhua later

17
00:00:29.333 --> 00:00:30.966
After all, they are all comrades

18
00:00:30.966 --> 00:00:33.000
Really, you are so kind

19
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.566
By the way, Xiaoxia

20
00:00:34.566 --> 00:00:37.800
Didn't your family send you oil tea and fried rice?

21
00:00:38.933 --> 00:00:40.166
To Qin Xiaoxia

22
00:00:40.166 --> 00:00:41.266
You take some out

23
00:00:41.266 --> 00:00:42.766
All our own colleagues

24
00:00:42.766 --> 00:00:44.500
Don't be stingy like a capitalist

25
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.300
We're going to prepare new ginger and garlic for you

26
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.866
But I don't have bone soup.

27
00:00:55.866 --> 00:00:58.700
This tour guide soup is not as bad as bone soup

28
00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:00.533
It's okay, I have brown sugar.

29
00:01:00.533 --> 00:01:02.966
I'll get some brown sugar scallion oil tea to fry the rice

30
00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.900
Zhenzhen, you are so generous

31
00:01:15.166 --> 00:01:16.366
My Evergreen Cookies

32
00:01:16.366 --> 00:01:18.266
The white rabbit toffee is gone

33
00:01:18.533 --> 00:01:21.600
What? That's a high-end brocade product on the account.

34
00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.166
The provincial capital requires three tickets

35
00:01:23.166 --> 00:01:24.866
But money and tickets can't buy it

36
00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:26.466
Ah, that's right.

37
00:01:26.466 --> 00:01:28.600
I just saw the clerk move all his things

38
00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.700
He must have stolen something

39
00:01:34.266 --> 00:01:36.400
I'd rather have this shameless little broken shoe

40
00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.700
After I tricked the package of cookies out of his hand

41
00:01:39.733 --> 00:01:41.900
I'm willing to eat one piece a week

42
00:01:41.933 --> 00:01:43.633
How dare he steal it back?

43
00:01:43.933 --> 00:01:45.000
As soon as he got close

44
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.800
The bad guy who devolved the transformation

45
00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:48.300
The mind is corrupted

46
00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:49.800
Now they're all thieves

47
00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.633
The cookies and toffee are not all neighbors

48
00:01:53.166 --> 00:01:53.933
So what?

49
00:01:53.933 --> 00:01:54.966
He gives real

50
00:01:54.966 --> 00:01:56.100
That's real.

51
00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:58.566
Let's go to the village team and sue him

52
00:01:58.566 --> 00:02:00.600
To be a thief, you have to hang a tag and parade the streets

53
00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.600
Wang Jianhua didn't succeed.

54
00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.200
I can just force Li Yan to deal with him personally

55
00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.466
We will go to Brother Li Yan to preside over justice
