1
00:00:02.933 --> 00:00:03.933
Not us.

2
00:00:03.933 --> 00:00:05.000
It's the three of us

3
00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.300
You run away and take me with you

4
00:00:08.933 --> 00:00:10.500
Don't you feel dragged down?

5
00:00:11.733 --> 00:00:13.833
Want to run tonight is the best chance

6
00:00:13.933 --> 00:00:15.666
Yeah don't hesitate anymore

7
00:00:15.666 --> 00:00:18.166
If you want to run away, tonight is the best chance

8
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.500
Once we're out

9
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.600
I can contact my colleagues outside to pick us up

10
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:22.900
Guaranteed to be foolproof

11
00:00:24.166 --> 00:00:25.566
What about the two children?

12
00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:27.000
Aren't you looking for them?

13
00:00:27.133 --> 00:00:28.533
I searched the whole place.

14
00:00:28.533 --> 00:00:30.000
It's none of their business

15
00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:31.800
Let's live first

16
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:34.400
All right. I'll come with you.

17
00:00:37.166 --> 00:00:38.633
Take care of him for me

18
00:00:38.866 --> 00:00:40.666
The guards outside are all locals

19
00:00:40.666 --> 00:00:43.233
I'll check it out and be back soon.

20
00:00:43.333 --> 00:00:45.400
Pay attention to safety and security

21
00:00:47.266 --> 00:00:48.300
Be careful!

22
00:00:57.666 --> 00:00:59.433
Save Luna when the time comes

23
00:00:59.466 --> 00:01:02.000
This news should be a hot search for several days

24
00:01:02.066 --> 00:01:05.100
This time the position of director should be mine

25
00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:11.566
Sister Wang

26
00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:13.600
Mengmeng

27
00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:18.233
Is there something you're not telling me?

28
00:01:18.966 --> 00:01:21.400
I heard Luna was missing

29
00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:22.900
I came out to look for it

30
00:01:23.133 --> 00:01:24.866
What Luna is missing is

31
00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.566
How did you know about me?

32
00:01:35.566 --> 00:01:37.966
Let's go. Let me show you something
