1
00:00:03.566 --> 00:00:04.433
Phineas

2
00:00:05.066 --> 00:00:06.900
Lin Shao is ready

3
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:10.300
What do you want to play?

4
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:14.100
Monkey is ready

5
00:00:25.933 --> 00:00:28.200
Four sixes to hum.

6
00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:30.266
Oops, Yan

7
00:00:30.766 --> 00:00:33.033
Why don't you save some face for Master Lin?

8
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.266
The table is about justice and fairness

9
00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.400
If I hide

10
00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.200
That is not to give Lingchao face

11
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:43.833
That being the case

12
00:00:44.133 --> 00:00:45.766
Why don't we gamble big?

13
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:48.300
Sure, if I win

14
00:00:48.766 --> 00:00:51.100
How about losing Luna to me?

15
00:00:53.766 --> 00:00:55.500
What if you lose?

16
00:00:55.933 --> 00:00:56.766
100 million beautiful

17
00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:58.833
Yuan is willing to admit defeat

18
00:01:01.166 --> 00:01:02.200
OK

19
00:01:16.733 --> 00:01:17.800
I won.

20
00:01:18.866 --> 00:01:19.900
How is that possible?

21
00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.366
Ah Fei put up with me for too long

22
00:01:22.566 --> 00:01:23.600
That $100 million

23
00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:25.666
I will still accompany you

24
00:01:26.366 --> 00:01:28.700
Hold on, seal all the doors for me

25
00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.566
Not a single fly will fly out today.

26
00:01:30.566 --> 00:01:32.233
I, Lin Shao, live so big

27
00:01:32.733 --> 00:01:34.700
No one dares to stand in my way

28
00:01:35.733 --> 00:01:37.133
Naturally not at South Lake

29
00:01:37.133 --> 00:01:39.633
But the gang is my turf

30
00:01:39.933 --> 00:01:41.366
I'd like to see it today

31
00:01:41.366 --> 00:01:43.200
See whose territory the gang belongs to
