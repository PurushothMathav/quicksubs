00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.000
Why hasn't this Master Qin come yet?

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.266
Won't blow me up

3
00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:09.933
Impossible to sign

4
00:00:09.933 --> 00:00:12.600
It's not that Xiao's generation won't do this kind of thing

5
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.500
Brother Fei, it's useless for us to be blind

6
00:00:16.766 --> 00:00:18.100
Can't do business?

7
00:00:18.133 --> 00:00:20.966
Why don't you call and ask first?

8
00:00:28.666 --> 00:00:29.466
Black brother

9
00:00:29.866 --> 00:00:32.066
The trees over there in Qingyan don't have this kind of thing at all

10
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:34.433
What? We got bombed?

11
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.000
Who the hell is a liar?

12
00:00:44.566 --> 00:00:46.500
You've been fooling around for so long

13
00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:49.433
Didn't you find someone missing? Who?

14
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:52.166
Chen Ajun

15
00:00:53.533 --> 00:00:54.800
I'll have someone pick it up right away

16
00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:55.600
Ding Muzhe

17
00:00:55.966 --> 00:00:57.666
Post the photo of Chen Ajun

18
00:00:57.666 --> 00:00:58.866
Notify all officials

19
00:00:58.866 --> 00:01:01.833
No one is to let him out without my permission

20
00:01:02.333 --> 00:01:03.600
Go out and find Chen Ajun

21
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.000
One person is enough

22
00:01:05.133 --> 00:01:07.066
He is probably an undercover agent who came to pick up the child

23
00:01:07.733 --> 00:01:08.533
Humph

24
00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.100
Dad, I'm hungry!

25
00:01:21.766 --> 00:01:25.866
Dad, I'm so tired, baby, keep at it

26
00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:28.433
Let's go

27
00:01:38.266 --> 00:01:40.900
Dad, I'm scared.

28
00:01:41.733 --> 00:01:42.666
Don't be afraid child

29
00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:43.866
Dad is here

30
00:01:46.166 --> 00:01:46.966
Ah Jun
