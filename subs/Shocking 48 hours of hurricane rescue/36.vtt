1
00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:03.433
Really?

2
00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.500
Can you tell me more about what I just asked you?

3
00:00:09.166 --> 00:00:10.766
It's actually quite simple

4
00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:13.300
Although this is not a place for people to stay

5
00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:15.000
But the salary is really high.

6
00:00:15.366 --> 00:00:18.200
Some people already know what this place is for

7
00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:19.966
It's for the money

8
00:00:20.366 --> 00:00:23.400
Some people are forced just like us

9
00:00:23.666 --> 00:00:25.266
But institutionalized

10
00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.833
Helping those who bully themselves bully others

11
00:00:27.933 --> 00:00:30.000
Instead, I feel comfortable

12
00:00:30.266 --> 00:00:31.900
Did you ever think about getting out?

13
00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.000
Escape

14
00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:38.666
Enter here and try to escape unless you die

15
00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:41.400
Otherwise, your family

16
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.100
Get in touch with the Nanyang Chamber of Commerce

17
00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.033
Ken spent a lot of money to get you out

18
00:00:45.866 --> 00:00:48.266
So, Luna, you are an internet celebrity now.

19
00:00:48.333 --> 00:00:50.266
Is there nothing you can do at home?

20
00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.600
Maybe. But I don't know how to say it.

21
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.000
In fact, my ex-boyfriend is Lin Siyan

22
00:00:57.566 --> 00:01:00.633
But I had a bit of a conflict with him before coming here

23
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:02.366
Have broken up
