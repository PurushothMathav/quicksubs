00:00:08.666 --> 00:00:10.366
Who the hell paved me

2
00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:13.833
Flying dog flying dog flying dog flying dog

3
00:00:13.866 --> 00:00:14.900
What about Lu Gona?

4
00:00:15.366 --> 00:00:16.566
I don't know, flying dog.

5
00:00:17.466 --> 00:00:20.066
And quibble that they say you are holding my name

6
00:00:20.066 --> 00:00:21.166
Weave them away

7
00:00:21.166 --> 00:00:21.766
Phineas

8
00:00:21.766 --> 00:00:24.100
I did it to teach that stinky bitch a lesson for you

9
00:00:24.466 --> 00:00:26.266
Silly Lord Silly Lord washed me away

10
00:00:26.266 --> 00:00:27.666
Then take Luna away

11
00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:32.133
You see it clearly

12
00:00:32.133 --> 00:00:34.000
Yan is still tied up in death row

13
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:34.800
Say

14
00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:36.833
Tell me where Luna went

15
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:37.833
That's not possible.

16
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.866
I clearly saw it.

17
00:00:50.266 --> 00:00:50.966
Phineas

18
00:00:50.966 --> 00:00:53.366
As I said, this kid has a lot of ideas

19
00:00:57.133 --> 00:00:59.966
There must be something wrong with Fei Ge's monitoring just now.

20
00:00:59.966 --> 00:01:01.200
He must have done it.

21
00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:03.400
How dare you run away

22
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.966
Run away, even if Sun Monkey

23
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.433
Can't escape the palm of the Buddha

24
00:01:09.933 --> 00:01:11.600
The whole company will give me a careful search

25
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.566
Don't leave any corner to find him

26
00:01:16.766 --> 00:01:18.233
Yes go

27
00:01:22.066 --> 00:01:23.000
Mengmeng hasn't come back yet

28
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.466
Will everything be okay?

29
00:01:27.933 --> 00:01:29.666
It's okay, just wait.

30
00:01:29.733 --> 00:01:30.933
Even if you dig three feet

31
00:01:30.933 --> 00:01:32.866
I also want to find Luna and A Yan for me

32
00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:34.200
People come out

33
00:01:36.366 --> 00:01:37.366
come out
