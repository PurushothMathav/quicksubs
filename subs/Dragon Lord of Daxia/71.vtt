1
00:00:00.066 --> 00:00:01.000
You are here

2
00:00:06.533 --> 00:00:08.400
Ye Shao spent years

3
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:09.233
Countless experiences

4
00:00:09.233 --> 00:00:11.800
The ancient Xia Book of Changes found after hundreds of millions of properties

5
00:00:11.833 --> 00:00:13.233
It was destroyed.

6
00:00:13.233 --> 00:00:15.633
Xiao Chen Private, I, Gu Xia, don't say it anymore

7
00:00:15.633 --> 00:00:17.466
Dare to slander like this

8
00:00:17.466 --> 00:00:18.800
I want you dead.

9
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.933
I will use the power of Tengyun Chamber of Commerce

10
00:00:20.933 --> 00:00:22.633
Let you live until tomorrow

11
00:00:22.633 --> 00:00:23.600
slander

12
00:00:24.633 --> 00:00:26.000
Counterfeit without slander

13
00:00:26.066 --> 00:00:28.566
Ye Shaofanqing calm down

14
00:00:28.633 --> 00:00:32.200
Xiao Xiaoyou, you have to give a reasonable explanation

15
00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.266
Otherwise, the old man can't be guaranteed

16
00:00:34.266 --> 00:00:36.600
This ancient summer has been passed down for thousands of years

17
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.433
The papermaking book of thousands of years ago is rough and soft

18
00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.033
And the texture of this one

19
00:00:42.333 --> 00:00:43.533
Not only stiff

20
00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:46.900
It's so smooth.

21
00:00:47.333 --> 00:00:48.700
This shows that

22
00:00:49.233 --> 00:00:50.833
This is a counterfeit

23
00:00:51.333 --> 00:00:54.466
Secondly, I have seen the real ancient summer clothes gold.

24
00:00:54.466 --> 00:00:57.800
The text inside is completely different from this one

25
00:00:58.300 --> 00:00:59.433
This shows that

26
00:00:59.466 --> 00:01:01.133
This book must be called Hu Yi

27
00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.133
That nonsense has been torn apart by you

28
00:01:04.133 --> 00:01:05.400
You can say whatever you want.

29
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.700
Let's talk about it again.

30
00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:12.500
This ancient Xia I Ching has not had an accident for a long time

31
00:01:13.433 --> 00:01:15.000
You said you saw the original

32
00:01:15.233 --> 00:01:17.433
Isn't that a contradiction?

33
00:01:17.466 --> 00:01:20.800
Look at the fox showing its tail

34
00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.200
Who said that Gu Xia has been lost for many years?

35
00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.766
He is clearly in the library of the Dragon Palace

36
00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.733
It just so happens that I want to give Gu Lao a gift.

37
00:01:32.533 --> 00:01:35.000
It also includes this ancient Xia I Ching

38
00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.100
At that time, it will be ripe and fake.

39
00:01:37.233 --> 00:01:38.633
One stroke

40
00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:41.100
Dragon Palace Library

41
00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.766
Thank you. Who do you think you are?

42
00:01:44.866 --> 00:01:46.366
Dragon Palace owner

43
00:01:46.866 --> 00:01:48.700
Building dragon master?

44
00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.500
Don't think I am
