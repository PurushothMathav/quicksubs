00:00:00.633 --> 00:00:01.933
Sir, please verify the capital.

2
00:00:02.066 --> 00:00:05.000
Xiao Chan, it's finally your turn.

3
00:00:05.133 --> 00:00:07.066
Hurry up and finish the inspection

4
00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:09.166
I'm starving

5
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.233
In fact, there is no need to test

6
00:00:11.433 --> 00:00:14.400
Anyway, this guy is not qualified to be at the wine table

7
00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:16.466
Let's not waste our time

8
00:00:17.466 --> 00:00:19.033
That's right.

9
00:00:19.133 --> 00:00:20.800
But I'm curious.

10
00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:24.666
How much personal wealth is depressed?

11
00:00:24.933 --> 00:00:26.900
Not a penny, right?

12
00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:29.533
Hahahaha

13
00:00:30.333 --> 00:00:31.800
You laugh hard

14
00:00:32.166 --> 00:00:35.433
You won't be able to laugh later

15
00:00:35.633 --> 00:00:40.533
Continue to pack personal assets, but you can't pack them

16
00:00:40.533 --> 00:00:42.000
A bargain

17
00:00:42.166 --> 00:00:43.466
How many assets do you have?

18
00:00:43.466 --> 00:00:45.966
Hey, you only need to have ten million.

19
00:00:46.733 --> 00:00:48.333
I ate this table

20
00:00:48.333 --> 00:00:50.633
Cut a million hum

21
00:00:50.633 --> 00:00:53.266
Don't say millions, even if there are millions

22
00:00:53.266 --> 00:00:56.066
Our Su family will not kick him out either.

23
00:00:57.666 --> 00:00:58.566
how

24
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.933
Are you scared by too few digits?

25
00:01:02.733 --> 00:01:05.366
Here, sir. Here's your card, of course.

26
00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.800
Hey, is there any need to ask?

27
00:01:09.866 --> 00:01:12.266
Cary doesn't have a penny

28
00:01:12.333 --> 00:01:13.866
Afraid of being embarrassed to say it

29
00:01:13.866 --> 00:01:16.033
Give him the last shred of face

30
00:01:16.033 --> 00:01:17.733
Or Ye Shao depends on people

31
00:01:17.966 --> 00:01:20.533
My Sun Zhou has five bodies

32
00:01:20.533 --> 00:01:23.166
Just a fluke

33
00:01:23.933 --> 00:01:25.666
Then the capital verification is complete

34
00:01:25.966 --> 00:01:27.733
Come to your seats

35
00:01:27.966 --> 00:01:29.233
Oh, right.

36
00:01:29.333 --> 00:01:31.066
As for the two of you

37
00:01:31.333 --> 00:01:33.033
Are you going out by yourself?

38
00:01:33.433 --> 00:01:36.366
Or should I ask the security to ask you out?

39
00:01:36.666 --> 00:01:38.633
Give the waiter a little more time.

40
00:01:38.633 --> 00:01:39.833
What are you waiting for?

41
00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.666
You can't afford it, can you?

42
00:01:42.033 --> 00:01:44.000
Is the manager the guest?

43
00:01:44.266 --> 00:01:46.266
To see the Golden Dragon in my lifetime

44
00:01:46.333 --> 00:01:47.600
Really lucky for three lifetimes

45
00:01:47.766 --> 00:01:49.366
I don't know if the distinguished guest is going to be at this moment

46
00:01:49.366 --> 00:01:51.666
Open the trillion quota of this Golden Dragon Card?
