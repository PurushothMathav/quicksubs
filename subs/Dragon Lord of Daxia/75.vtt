00:00:01.633 --> 00:00:02.433
Humph

2
00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:05.200
Meet Chief Benlong

3
00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:07.800
Why not?

4
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.366
Why is it expensive?

5
00:00:09.466 --> 00:00:12.666
Xiao Chen, this is a genuine Dragon Palace

6
00:00:12.666 --> 00:00:13.833
human beings and

7
00:00:13.833 --> 00:00:16.100
Long Wei has the power of life and death

8
00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:18.366
Really blind, you dog eyes

9
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.700
Long Wei is the commander of Long Wei

10
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.300
Responsible for protecting the safety of the Dragon Palace

11
00:00:23.433 --> 00:00:27.500
But you have no right to draw a knife against the people of the hero

12
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:28.700
So here's one.

13
00:00:28.866 --> 00:00:31.300
Second, the Dragon Palace system is strict

14
00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:32.533
Hierarchical

15
00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:35.900
You have no law enforcement or investigative powers

16
00:00:36.633 --> 00:00:37.733
To sum up

17
00:00:38.366 --> 00:00:40.700
You've made a big mistake.

18
00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.133
Who are you?

19
00:00:42.966 --> 00:00:44.100
How to deal with the Dragon Palace

20
00:00:44.966 --> 00:00:46.033
So familiar

21
00:00:46.033 --> 00:00:48.566
Brother Long, don't be deceived by him

22
00:00:48.566 --> 00:00:50.766
I know this guy pretty well.

23
00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.666
He is a liar

24
00:00:53.666 --> 00:00:56.166
opportunistic scumbag

25
00:00:56.166 --> 00:00:58.200
Did he just scare you?

26
00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.266
Wait for your relationship with me

27
00:01:02.266 --> 00:01:05.433
I can still lie to you, can't you come to give a congratulatory gift today?

28
00:01:05.433 --> 00:01:06.800
But this congratulatory gift

29
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.666
But it was robbed by this young man

30
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.600
If this gets to the Dragon Palace

31
00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.166
Be punished for guilt

32
00:01:12.166 --> 00:01:15.233
If you let the lord in the Dragon Palace know your guilt

33
00:01:15.233 --> 00:01:18.300
It's hard to die, but as the captain of the Dragon Guard

34
00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:19.466
Don't shoot at will

35
00:01:19.466 --> 00:01:20.600
This is simple.

36
00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.533
You just need to help me hold down and kill me

37
00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.166
If something goes wrong, it's mine.

38
00:01:26.233 --> 00:01:27.800
If there is credit in the future

39
00:01:27.866 --> 00:01:29.866
All belong to Brother Long

40
00:01:29.866 --> 00:01:31.466
Good Dragon Palace

41
00:01:31.466 --> 00:01:33.300
Others withdraw the medicine as soon as possible

42
00:01:37.833 --> 00:01:40.066
Xiao Chan's current situation

43
00:01:40.066 --> 00:01:41.666
Do you have a way out?
