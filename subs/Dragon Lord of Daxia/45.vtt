00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:03.100
You uh you don't know the sky is high and the earth is thick

2
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.000
I'm going to call my dad

3
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.900
Let him take care of you calm down

4
00:00:06.966 --> 00:00:08.133
Don't be stupid

5
00:00:08.166 --> 00:00:10.800
至少都到现在了你还在演戏

6
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.700
You and you and you

7
00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:16.266
I have to die today

8
00:00:16.266 --> 00:00:18.900
Yesterday, the general envoy of Yunzhou came to me to catch up

9
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.166
Still in Qingzhou

10
00:00:20.166 --> 00:00:23.166
Mr. Xiao, the Governor of Yunzhou and I are rescuing the corporal

11
00:00:23.166 --> 00:00:24.200
Can you see if

12
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:25.566
Spare his life

13
00:00:26.633 --> 00:00:29.400
He had his life in his hands.

14
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.000
It's dad

15
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:32.466
I got hit.

16
00:00:32.666 --> 00:00:33.733
Come and save me

17
00:00:36.366 --> 00:00:39.966
Brother Wang heard that the Dragon Rising Banquet yesterday

18
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.633
你们钦州三十三世家吃了大亏了

19
00:00:43.633 --> 00:00:45.800
Now it's been ruined by a

20
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.000
That year, Brother Song laughed

21
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
In fact, it's all small things

22
00:00:50.033 --> 00:00:52.733
Then please ask Brother Song to clarify his doubts.

23
00:00:52.966 --> 00:00:56.566
What you are afraid of is nothing more than Qin Banwei

24
00:00:56.566 --> 00:00:58.200
This Qin family Qin Banwei

25
00:00:58.766 --> 00:01:01.266
Now the market is actively ashes.

26
00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.200
Qin Banwei can't jump for long

27
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:08.500
As for this Nyingchi Chau, I know this person very well

28
00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:09.800
timid

29
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.666
You guys are a little tougher

30
00:01:12.266 --> 00:01:14.166
Hmph, he doesn't even dare to fart

31
00:01:14.166 --> 00:01:16.900
Oh, listen to you

32
00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:18.866
Better than reading a ten-year book?

33
00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.300
Hahaha come come come

34
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.800
Hey dad, I got hit

35
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.200
Come and help me!
