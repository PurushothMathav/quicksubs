00:00:00.666 --> 00:00:02.000
Lu Qingyue peeps at you

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:02.766
A pair on weekdays

3
00:00:02.766 --> 00:00:04.966
The pure appearance of non-human fireworks

4
00:00:04.966 --> 00:00:08.766
Behind the scenes, he is so hungry

5
00:00:08.766 --> 00:00:09.866
Why are you here?

6
00:00:09.866 --> 00:00:11.500
This is Triumph Yunting

7
00:00:12.166 --> 00:00:13.366
Rich man's paradise

8
00:00:13.366 --> 00:00:15.600
It's not normal for me to come

9
00:00:15.666 --> 00:00:18.600
But even if you want to sell your beauty

10
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.533
At least find someone decent

11
00:00:20.533 --> 00:00:22.600
What does it mean to find a beggar?

12
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.366
How many times have I told you?

13
00:00:24.366 --> 00:00:27.166
Do I have to bend over when it comes to luggage?

14
00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:31.533
Why don't you want this month's salary?

15
00:00:31.533 --> 00:00:34.366
Wait. I told you you were my friend

16
00:00:34.366 --> 00:00:36.633
No one needs luggage

17
00:00:36.666 --> 00:00:39.700
Not even the presence of the country lord

18
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.933
Lu Qingyue, where did you find the best?

19
00:00:42.933 --> 00:00:45.033
I'm dying of laughter, hahaha.

20
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.700
I don't know if the lord is there or not

21
00:00:47.866 --> 00:00:50.566
I only know that I am Wang Meng

22
00:00:50.566 --> 00:00:52.700
Daughter of Wang He, the head of the Wang family in Jingzhou

23
00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:55.700
And he is just the Wang family group

24
00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:57.566
The next little nurse

25
00:00:57.566 --> 00:00:59.266
What do I tell him to do?

26
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.533
What does he have to do, mom?

27
00:01:01.533 --> 00:01:03.300
Just these two stinky beggars

28
00:01:03.466 --> 00:01:06.500
Talking to them is downgrading

29
00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.266
Oh, people just don't like his face?

30
00:01:10.266 --> 00:01:11.500
What are you waiting for?

31
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.833
Don't bend over your luggage yet?
