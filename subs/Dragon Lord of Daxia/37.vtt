1
00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:01.366
We don't do cleaning.

2
00:00:01.366 --> 00:00:02.133
Get out

3
00:00:02.133 --> 00:00:04.266
Don't step on our floor, you misunderstood.

4
00:00:04.266 --> 00:00:06.466
We are here to attend Gu Lao's thank you banquet

5
00:00:06.966 --> 00:00:08.466
Do you know where this is?

6
00:00:08.666 --> 00:00:09.866
Triumph Yunting

7
00:00:09.966 --> 00:00:11.533
The top hotel in Qinzhou

8
00:00:11.533 --> 00:00:12.766
Inherited for a hundred years

9
00:00:12.766 --> 00:00:14.733
The governors of Qinzhou in successive dynasties personally managed

10
00:00:14.733 --> 00:00:16.333
People who come and go are not expensive

11
00:00:16.333 --> 00:00:18.000
Tie up your clothes

12
00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:19.866
I'm afraid it's less than 200 bucks.

13
00:00:19.866 --> 00:00:22.766
When to enter and exit the hotel depends on the grade of the clothes.

14
00:00:22.766 --> 00:00:23.633
and

15
00:00:23.633 --> 00:00:27.000
I specially told Nyingchi Zhou Gu Lao's thank you banquet

16
00:00:27.033 --> 00:00:28.400
Anyone can participate

17
00:00:28.466 --> 00:00:29.966
As long as you are grateful

18
00:00:30.333 --> 00:00:32.333
Even the most destitute beggar

19
00:00:32.533 --> 00:00:34.966
Boy, you want to pick up girls and play prestige

20
00:00:34.966 --> 00:00:37.000
Don't go out to make trouble completely

21
00:00:37.033 --> 00:00:38.566
You don't even know how you died

22
00:00:38.566 --> 00:00:41.266
You still told the Governor of Qinzhou

23
00:00:41.333 --> 00:00:42.666
Why didn't you say you wanted the number Reichen?

24
00:00:42.666 --> 00:00:43.866
What about the thirty-third family of Zhou?

25
00:00:43.866 --> 00:00:45.366
I think they are too powerful

26
00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:47.700
It's an eyesore

27
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.100
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.

28
00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.633
Let's go to the small town, let's go

29
00:00:51.633 --> 00:00:53.366
You're a little self-aware.

30
00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:55.366
Look at the old thank you banquet

31
00:00:55.366 --> 00:00:56.866
I didn't want to pursue it

32
00:00:56.866 --> 00:00:59.066
But since you say so, fine

33
00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.166
Today I'm going to start

34
00:01:01.666 --> 00:01:04.200
You walk in.
