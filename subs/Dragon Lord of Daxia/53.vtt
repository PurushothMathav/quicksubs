00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.633
Xiao Chen, are you really the Dragon Lord?

2
00:00:06.933 --> 00:00:09.200
Yes or no, what's the difference?

3
00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:10.566
Of course!

4
00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:12.266
Everyone in Qinzhou knows

5
00:00:12.266 --> 00:00:14.900
Mr. Su secretly promises the love of the dragon master

6
00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:16.300
Don't hesitate to be with you

7
00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:17.366
Bah bah bah bah

8
00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:18.833
What I mean is...

9
00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.266
If he knew you were the Dragon Lord

10
00:00:21.266 --> 00:00:23.366
I will definitely get back with you.

11
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.233
Continue to live together

12
00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.233
Love kidnapped by identity

13
00:00:29.566 --> 00:00:30.766
It doesn't make any sense.

14
00:00:30.766 --> 00:00:32.566
Then since you are the Dragon Lord

15
00:00:32.566 --> 00:00:34.100
Then the thank you banquet

16
00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.000
You must have also arranged for it to be held in the Triumph Camp Hall

17
00:00:37.566 --> 00:00:39.633
那为什么外界都在盛传

18
00:00:39.766 --> 00:00:41.500
He is the young master of Tengyun Chamber of Commerce

19
00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.400
Iowan did it.

20
00:00:43.933 --> 00:00:44.766
Oh.

21
00:00:46.066 --> 00:00:47.400
这个我不知道

22
00:00:47.566 --> 00:00:48.666
嗯

23
00:00:49.566 --> 00:00:51.800
三年前北京一战

24
00:00:51.866 --> 00:00:53.300
大夏急急可危

25
00:00:54.166 --> 00:00:56.433
It's you who rode three thousand miles straight

26
00:00:56.533 --> 00:00:58.300
Burning Blood Huilong Knife

27
00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.066
Angry sky knocks the hand of the general

28
00:01:01.666 --> 00:01:04.833
Save the Border from Dire

29
00:01:06.266 --> 00:01:09.233
So you really ran 3,000 miles?

30
00:01:09.766 --> 00:01:11.700
Why are you asking so many questions all of a sudden?

31
00:01:12.366 --> 00:01:16.466
It's not your fault that there are too many rumors and people are curious

32
00:01:16.733 --> 00:01:18.466
Let's go to the banquet hall first

33
00:01:21.066 --> 00:01:23.100
Come, come, come

34
00:01:23.266 --> 00:01:24.066
Long time no see.

35
00:01:24.133 --> 00:01:25.500
Come and blow one

36
00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.266
Hey, on the crab

37
00:01:28.166 --> 00:01:30.033
Xiao Chen, why is he here?

38
00:01:30.766 --> 00:01:33.666
I heard that you just divorced my Lingyan family

39
00:01:33.666 --> 00:01:36.266
The back foot hooks up with other fox spirits

40
00:01:36.666 --> 00:01:38.633
Time is so short

41
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.233
You're hooking up with another fox again
