1
00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.700
10 million so you should be satisfied

2
00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.800
20 million too little

3
00:00:04.933 --> 00:00:06.000
Then you make a price

4
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.233
I try to satisfy

5
00:00:07.533 --> 00:00:08.400
Su Lingyan

6
00:00:09.333 --> 00:00:11.433
Do you think that everything can be measured by money?

7
00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:13.300
Money is not everything

8
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.066
But without money, you can't

9
00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.733
Hmph, a 3-year-old child understands this principle

10
00:00:18.733 --> 00:00:20.466
Don't you just want to be more corrupt?

11
00:00:20.466 --> 00:00:22.400
Ah, what are you packing?

12
00:00:22.533 --> 00:00:24.100
Keep your house and stop acting here

13
00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:26.700
It's not your turn to intervene in our couple's affairs

14
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:28.666
Xiao Chen, show some respect

15
00:00:28.666 --> 00:00:31.100
This is the eldest young master of the Chen family of the four great families in Xinzhou

16
00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:32.866
Can't say he withdrew from the bid in time

17
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.700
How could Mr. Su successfully get the cooperation project?

18
00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:36.933
An efficacious eye.

19
00:00:36.933 --> 00:00:39.600
Sooner or later, the energy in the building will glow and heat up

20
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.733
I did it just by pushing him.

21
00:00:41.733 --> 00:00:43.600
Let him avoid detours for more than ten years

22
00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.133
And you trash

23
00:00:45.133 --> 00:00:47.166
Don't know the business insider of high society

24
00:00:47.166 --> 00:00:48.333
That's normal.

25
00:00:48.333 --> 00:00:51.566
Qingzhou 10 billion project is what I asked the headquarters to hand over to the Su family

26
00:00:51.566 --> 00:00:53.333
It has half a dime to do with you.

27
00:00:53.333 --> 00:00:55.966
Hahahahaha ah

28
00:00:55.966 --> 00:00:57.200
Full of nonsense

29
00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:00.166
Why don't you say that the Governor of Qingzhou is your subordinate?

30
00:01:00.166 --> 00:01:02.333
The governor's decree is set up for the Dragon Palace

31
00:01:02.333 --> 00:01:04.466
Strictly speaking, it does matter.

32
00:01:04.466 --> 00:01:06.300
Xiao Chen, have you made enough trouble?

33
00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:07.566
Huh how

34
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.666
Lingyan, calm down

35
00:01:11.466 --> 00:01:14.666
You have two options. One is to sign here with the money

36
00:01:14.666 --> 00:01:16.133
Then fuck off two

37
00:01:16.133 --> 00:01:19.333
Tell my men to beat you up like a real cripple

38
00:01:19.333 --> 00:01:22.366
Then get on the ground and sign for me

39
00:01:22.933 --> 00:01:24.366
Uh-huh.

40
00:01:25.733 --> 00:01:28.500
So this is the signature you want

41
00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:29.766
Don't make me get it
