00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.700
Dragon generals are slightly different from dragon generals and cannot be worn.

2
00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.966
Hell and open fire engraved on the back

3
00:00:05.966 --> 00:00:09.100
Could it be that the Qingming Dragon General owns it?

4
00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:10.200
Qingming Dragon General

5
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.866
Serve the supreme left and right all year round

6
00:00:12.866 --> 00:00:15.333
Therefore, it is also known as the Shadow Dragon General

7
00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.000
The moral is inseparable

8
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.333
Never give up

9
00:00:18.366 --> 00:00:19.900
I call it the Lord.

10
00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:21.100
Look around

11
00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:22.333
Let it be

12
00:00:22.866 --> 00:00:23.866
ask

13
00:00:24.433 --> 00:00:25.966
Who is he?

14
00:00:27.966 --> 00:00:30.666
Xiao Chan, you not only stole the Naishi token

15
00:00:30.766 --> 00:00:32.900
He also sent someone to injure the Dragon Palace

16
00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.200
You're finished. You're finished.

17
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.100
shut up

18
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.966
Dad, don't call me dad

19
00:00:40.466 --> 00:00:42.800
I don't have you as my son

20
00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.133
Little Mr. Chen's family has no eyes

21
00:00:46.266 --> 00:00:47.400
Offended you

22
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.266
Please don't remember the villains.

23
00:00:50.266 --> 00:00:52.700
Give our Chen family a way to live

24
00:00:53.833 --> 00:00:57.266
Dad, don't be deceived by this liar

25
00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:02.066
Mr. Xiao, Juanzi's ignorance makes you laugh

26
00:01:02.066 --> 00:01:03.900
I asked him to kowtow to you

27
00:01:04.066 --> 00:01:05.400
If you don't say stop

28
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.333
And I kept him kowtowing.

29
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.700
What a ignorant

30
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.300
Earlier he said he was going to break my leg and embarrass me

31
00:01:17.566 --> 00:01:18.900
Just now

32
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.800
He's going to issue a kill order against me

33
00:01:22.233 --> 00:01:23.700
Call me a traitor

34
00:01:23.966 --> 00:01:25.600
And just after you came

35
00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.900
He also said you shouldn't kneel down

36
00:01:29.066 --> 00:01:30.733
So many things add up

37
00:01:30.966 --> 00:01:34.200
It's over with ignorance
