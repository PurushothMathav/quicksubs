00:00:02.133 --> 00:00:05.400
Ah, how could it be him by the wife?

2
00:00:13.533 --> 00:00:14.333
mother

3
00:00:15.666 --> 00:00:19.000
My son is indeed a great general, so majestic

4
00:00:21.733 --> 00:00:24.166
This is Miss Su, right?

5
00:00:24.333 --> 00:00:26.200
Sure enough, it's extravagant

6
00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.766
Xiaolan has seen Auntie well

7
00:00:28.766 --> 00:00:30.100
Hurry up and fulfill the contract

8
00:00:32.933 --> 00:00:36.566
Today, I can finally get the yellow-faced woman at home

9
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.600
Kicked out

10
00:00:40.366 --> 00:00:42.966
You're here, mother, look

11
00:00:42.966 --> 00:00:45.733
This is my gift to my father

12
00:00:45.733 --> 00:00:48.366
Daughter, why are you so amazing?

13
00:00:48.366 --> 00:00:49.266
Like this sword

14
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.666
Daddy must have been very wronged to kill the enemy, right?

15
00:00:53.733 --> 00:00:55.266
Daddy Daddy

16
00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:56.400
daddy

17
00:00:57.166 --> 00:00:58.633
Who is back?

18
00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:06.066
This is the daughter of the emperor

19
00:01:06.066 --> 00:01:07.733
My son has achieved today

20
00:01:07.733 --> 00:01:10.233
But thanks to Miss Su

21
00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.466
The so-called Guilin, right?

22
00:01:12.466 --> 00:01:13.933
Well, you sit first.

23
00:01:13.933 --> 00:01:16.500
I happened to ask about the celebration wine, I'll be right back

24
00:01:19.733 --> 00:01:20.533
dislocation

25
00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.033
What a rule

26
00:01:23.366 --> 00:01:23.966
This is you.

27
00:01:23.966 --> 00:01:26.300
The yellow-faced woman who can only do laundry and cook

28
00:01:26.966 --> 00:01:28.666
Sure enough, the sour smell

29
00:01:29.466 --> 00:01:31.300
Don't say my mother

30
00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:37.700
come

31
00:01:41.933 --> 00:01:42.866
Here comes the wine

32
00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:47.133
Hey let me tell you

33
00:01:47.133 --> 00:01:49.966
I buried this wine before you went on your expedition

34
00:01:49.966 --> 00:01:51.633
Just in time for your triumphant return

35
00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:54.600
It's like imported wine

36
00:02:00.166 --> 00:02:01.266
Try it

37
00:02:01.266 --> 00:02:02.633
Are you bored?

38
00:02:03.333 --> 00:02:05.000
I didn't know you needed a loyal toast

39
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.600
Are you trying to hurt me?
