1
00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.333
Your Majesty, what the king said is

2
00:00:03.333 --> 00:00:05.666
Our country's warrior martial arts is the first in Japan

3
00:00:05.666 --> 00:00:08.800
Not even the best swordsman in our country can defeat him

4
00:00:08.866 --> 00:00:11.700
The party princess must not have won him

5
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.300
Those sword masters are trash

6
00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:15.400
Can't you represent my royal sister?

7
00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:18.100
I feel that my eldest sister will win

8
00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:19.800
If you ministers don't believe it

9
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.200
Hide behind and watch

10
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:22.600
Where did all this nonsense come from?

11
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:25.600
Flowers

12
00:00:26.066 --> 00:00:27.666
If we don't win the second round

13
00:00:27.666 --> 00:00:29.000
We lost the third round.

14
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Why don't I handle them for you in this game?

15
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.133
It won't happen.

16
00:00:34.133 --> 00:00:37.200
You just need to protect our family

17
00:00:37.933 --> 00:00:39.033
And before you

18
00:00:43.966 --> 00:00:45.766
The second round of competition technology

19
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:49.233
The one who blows the sword in the opponent's hand first wins

20
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.133
But stop there.

21
00:00:51.133 --> 00:00:52.800
Do not harm lives

22
00:00:53.566 --> 00:00:54.666
No card

23
00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:00.833
It's better than, it's better than, it's more exciting

24
00:01:00.866 --> 00:01:03.566
You can't hurt people in the competition arena

25
00:01:03.566 --> 00:01:05.333
What kind of competition is that?

26
00:01:05.333 --> 00:01:07.333
You have a point.

27
00:01:07.333 --> 00:01:10.800
Then this competition will be changed to a life-and-death competition

28
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.833
The dead fall to the ground

29
00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.100
How does the living strategist win?
