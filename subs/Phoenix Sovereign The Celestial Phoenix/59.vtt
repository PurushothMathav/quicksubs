1
00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:04.133
Baga you all work

2
00:00:04.133 --> 00:00:07.366
Prince Baga can't afford to lose

3
00:00:07.366 --> 00:00:08.400
Besides

4
00:00:08.933 --> 00:00:11.233
We haven't lost yet.

5
00:00:11.466 --> 00:00:14.366
You two push him off me

6
00:00:17.466 --> 00:00:20.566
That's right, those three games allowed you to win two by chance

7
00:00:20.566 --> 00:00:21.700
But don't forget.

8
00:00:21.733 --> 00:00:24.433
This third game is heart chess

9
00:00:24.866 --> 00:00:26.766
It takes two people to play at the same time

10
00:00:26.766 --> 00:00:28.900
One person plays chess with our rider

11
00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:32.500
The other plays the role of a general and kills enemies on the chessboard

12
00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.900
Whether the eldest princess is lucky or a salvo

13
00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.933
I'm afraid there's no way to dissect the corpse by one person

14
00:00:38.933 --> 00:00:41.866
Do you have any capable people to challenge?

15
00:00:41.866 --> 00:00:44.600
If not, you lose

16
00:00:45.166 --> 00:00:46.400
Knights of Jinluo

17
00:00:47.066 --> 00:00:47.933
superb skills

18
00:00:47.933 --> 00:00:50.366
In this world, no one has won at all

19
00:00:50.366 --> 00:00:52.500
So no one dares to fight in the building

20
00:00:52.933 --> 00:00:54.000
Also normal

21
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:54.900
Exactly.

22
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:58.800
After all, this chess was invented by my ancestors in the first Luo country

23
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.966
Even if you Daxia have capable people

24
00:01:00.966 --> 00:01:02.766
I only know a little bit

25
00:01:02.766 --> 00:01:04.966
Bold nonsense

26
00:01:04.966 --> 00:01:07.600
Chess was invented by our Great Xia ancestors

27
00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.566
The King of Silla

28
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.866
Don't even think about the mouth sticking together here

29
00:01:11.866 --> 00:01:13.000
Just want to own it

30
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:13.900
OK

31
00:01:14.733 --> 00:01:18.133
The Empress Dowager of Great Xia said that chess was invented by your country

32
00:01:18.133 --> 00:01:19.666
Then why are you Daxia?

33
00:01:19.666 --> 00:01:22.733
No one dares to come out and fight with the princess

34
00:01:22.733 --> 00:01:24.866
Have you forgotten about Silla?

35
00:01:24.866 --> 00:01:28.266
I, Great Xia, once led 28 people to take the Silla Kingdom

36
00:01:28.266 --> 00:01:29.600
Why have so many years passed?

37
00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.766
You still like stealing from people so much?

38
00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:33.900
What are you?

39
00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.700
Dare to talk nonsense here

40
00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:36.800
All of you.

41
00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:40.100
Is there anyone who can come out and fight together?

42
00:01:40.133 --> 00:01:41.200
If not

43
00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:42.766
Then you lose

44
00:01:42.766 --> 00:01:44.166
Make good on your promise

45
00:01:44.166 --> 00:01:46.066
Land cession indemnity

46
00:01:46.466 --> 00:01:47.766
Who said missed

47
00:01:48.133 --> 00:01:49.166
This king is down

48
00:01:49.166 --> 00:01:52.266
Nan Wang is willing to be the battleship general of the eldest princess
