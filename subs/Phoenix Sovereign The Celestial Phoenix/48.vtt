00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.000
Baoer, never

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.800
You can't get carried away with anger

3
00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:05.066
The matter between the two countries

4
00:00:05.066 --> 00:00:06.800
It's not as simple as you think

5
00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:08.633
Mother, don't worry.

6
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:09.866
I will be lost

7
00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:14.600
Sister Huang, this is no small matter

8
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.266
I will use the emperor for a while

9
00:00:17.266 --> 00:00:18.566
Mother, don't worry.

10
00:00:18.566 --> 00:00:19.900
I will not lose

11
00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:20.566
Grandpa Turtle

12
00:00:20.566 --> 00:00:22.300
So what if you have the status of a princess?

13
00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:23.866
Now the heroic woman is dead

14
00:00:23.866 --> 00:00:24.933
Wait for the hero to perish

15
00:00:24.933 --> 00:00:26.200
You will eventually become a sword girl

16
00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:29.200
And I will rise with the power of mastering the country

17
00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.266
Death is destined to step on your head

18
00:00:31.266 --> 00:00:32.766
Three more to win the world

19
00:00:32.766 --> 00:00:35.066
What a heroic woman

20
00:00:35.066 --> 00:00:36.333
Don't be too happy

21
00:00:36.333 --> 00:00:39.266
If anyone loses, they have to cede 3,000 miles of land

22
00:00:39.266 --> 00:00:40.633
60 cities

23
00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.700
You can't fight

24
00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:47.600
Princess Zhang, but you are qualified to represent Great Xia

25
00:00:47.866 --> 00:00:48.900
Cut the city and let the emperor

26
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:52.766
Will your Emperor agree to such a major event?

27
00:00:52.933 --> 00:00:54.900
Don't be impulsive about this.

28
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.700
Although Princess Zhang is noble

29
00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:58.500
But he's just a woman

30
00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.700
How can I win the three powerhouses on the opposite side?

31
00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.266
Your Majesty, the eldest princess is acting out of emotion

32
00:01:04.266 --> 00:01:05.766
You're not going to live that long.

33
00:01:05.766 --> 00:01:08.266
Rich because you have to go to Your Majesty to think clearly

34
00:01:08.266 --> 00:01:09.466
After all, if you lose

35
00:01:09.466 --> 00:01:11.666
You are sinners through the ages

36
00:01:14.366 --> 00:01:16.300
I agree.
