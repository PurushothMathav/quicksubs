1
00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:03.033
Okay, another one to die

2
00:00:03.666 --> 00:00:06.966
So why don't we gamble bigger?

3
00:00:06.966 --> 00:00:08.066
What do you want to bet on?

4
00:00:08.066 --> 00:00:09.300
If you lose

5
00:00:09.333 --> 00:00:11.066
I won't let you cede land to pay compensation either

6
00:00:11.066 --> 00:00:14.200
Just let the people of our country settle in Daxia at will

7
00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.966
Let the people of Daxia meet anyone in our country

8
00:00:16.966 --> 00:00:18.466
Kneel down

9
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:19.733
bow down

10
00:00:19.733 --> 00:00:22.700
How about the first class of the enemy and the devil country in the generation?

11
00:00:22.733 --> 00:00:25.066
What if you lose?

12
00:00:25.066 --> 00:00:26.866
If my new Russia loses

13
00:00:26.866 --> 00:00:29.933
Then we are willing to become a vassal country of Great Xia

14
00:00:29.933 --> 00:00:32.466
It's a deal, Your Majesty, absolutely not

15
00:00:32.533 --> 00:00:34.766
Princess Zhang grew up in the countryside

16
00:00:34.766 --> 00:00:35.800
Can't even read

17
00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.600
How can you play chess with a chess master?

18
00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:38.700
If you lose

19
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.200
We shall be slaves and servants

20
00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.100
Your Majesty, please think twice.

21
00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:43.500
Yes!

22
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.966
Now all over the county are visiting guests, but they have to lead wolves into the house

23
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.933
bow down

24
00:00:47.933 --> 00:00:49.333
Wouldn't it be that billions of people

25
00:00:49.333 --> 00:00:51.233
Caught in the land of eternal doom

26
00:00:52.166 --> 00:00:52.800
Your Majesty

27
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.300
Why don't you let the eldest princess admit defeat in this game?

28
00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:56.566
Win two games first

29
00:00:56.566 --> 00:00:59.333
Admit defeat in this game, maybe there is a compromise knife technique

30
00:00:59.333 --> 00:01:01.066
Don't let the big man

31
00:01:01.166 --> 00:01:03.100
Into dire straits?

32
00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:04.866
Ministers

33
00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.166
When I meet a woman

34
00:01:06.166 --> 00:01:08.700
Will the hero dare to confront the enemy against justice?

35
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.100
Woman as man

36
00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:11.500
Imperial court officials

37
00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.866
But find someone else to set aside for yourself

38
00:01:13.866 --> 00:01:16.900
Princess Zhang Xinglong and the country defeated me

39
00:01:16.933 --> 00:01:17.900
No one can compare

40
00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.400
Even if the truth admits that others are powerful

41
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.700
What's there to say?

42
00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.100
I am big

43
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.566
People 1.40 billion

44
00:01:24.733 --> 00:01:27.100
Like a sea of stars

45
00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.266
How can we not win against such a small country?

46
00:01:29.366 --> 00:01:32.066
You ministers are so ignorant
