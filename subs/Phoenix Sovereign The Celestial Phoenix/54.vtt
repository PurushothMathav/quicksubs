00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:01.866
Wait, he can change it successfully.

2
00:00:01.866 --> 00:00:03.766
Then we can also change people.

3
00:00:03.766 --> 00:00:06.933
The lives of our country's warriors are like gold

4
00:00:06.933 --> 00:00:09.400
You can't afford to let go

5
00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:14.400
Let him fight for our country's warriors

6
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:15.600
Then replace him.

7
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.666
What lion?

8
00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.466
Are you kidding me?

9
00:00:19.766 --> 00:00:20.566
OK

10
00:00:21.533 --> 00:00:22.866
Yo bro

11
00:00:23.166 --> 00:00:24.933
You are letting you go

12
00:00:24.933 --> 00:00:27.566
That's because you have to work, hurry up

13
00:00:32.333 --> 00:00:34.166
Turtle you are a poisonous woman

14
00:00:34.166 --> 00:00:35.366
If you dare to hurt me

15
00:00:36.166 --> 00:00:37.166
Staring at you

16
00:00:37.166 --> 00:00:38.933
You might as well try

17
00:00:38.933 --> 00:00:41.666
See if I will kill you.

18
00:00:43.166 --> 00:00:44.433
You are revenge

19
00:00:44.466 --> 00:00:45.766
If you dare to kill me

20
00:00:45.766 --> 00:00:47.233
I can't let you go

21
00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:48.466
Just say this

22
00:00:48.466 --> 00:00:51.133
I don't know if it hurts you

23
00:00:51.133 --> 00:00:52.266
Still doesn't hurt

24
00:00:52.766 --> 00:00:53.566
After all?

25
00:00:53.566 --> 00:00:56.533
I'd like to see how you don't let me go

26
00:00:56.533 --> 00:00:58.666
Stop talking nonsense, do you want to shoot or not?
