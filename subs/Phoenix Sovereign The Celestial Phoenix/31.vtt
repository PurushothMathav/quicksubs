00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:03.066
Hmph, what Miss Wang said is

2
00:00:03.066 --> 00:00:06.866
I want to make the doctor's family an important official in the court

3
00:00:06.866 --> 00:00:11.000
How could it be for a lowly country girl?

4
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:12.900
Kneel down and kowtow

5
00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.266
If Commander Nangong asks us to apologize verbally

6
00:00:16.266 --> 00:00:17.166
That's it.

7
00:00:17.166 --> 00:00:20.700
Concubine Ben Ruo asked us to kowtow and confess

8
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:23.333
I can't protect the Lord, and Li Cheng will never accept it

9
00:00:23.333 --> 00:00:24.300
reception acceptance

10
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.100
accept or not

11
00:00:25.166 --> 00:00:27.600
Is there going to be a rebellion next?

12
00:00:28.733 --> 00:00:31.500
Commander Nangong became serious as a result

13
00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:35.466
We are all just poor for self-preservation

14
00:00:35.466 --> 00:00:38.033
But wants us to kneel down and apologize to him

15
00:00:38.133 --> 00:00:39.166
Absolutely impossible

16
00:00:39.166 --> 00:00:40.100
Absolutely impossible

17
00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.166
Can't be good

18
00:00:43.766 --> 00:00:45.400
I wanted to give it to you.

19
00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.400
A chance for families to reform

20
00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:49.700
But what about you?

21
00:00:49.733 --> 00:00:51.633
Ungrateful

22
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.266
Then don't blame me for being ruthless

23
00:00:56.933 --> 00:00:58.300
South court obeys orders

24
00:00:58.466 --> 00:01:01.866
Biography Shuaikou wants to bring everyone present

25
00:01:01.866 --> 00:01:03.566
It doesn't matter where men and women are

26
00:01:03.566 --> 00:01:06.000
Their entire official position and that of their families

27
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.700
Dare to speak wildly

28
00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:09.033
A village woman

29
00:01:09.133 --> 00:01:11.200
How dare you defy the court officials

30
00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.500
I'm so shameless, I'm so handsome

31
00:01:14.533 --> 00:01:16.333
I'll give you a chance now.

32
00:01:16.333 --> 00:01:17.366
Kneeling is a sin

33
00:01:17.366 --> 00:01:19.400
Otherwise, the audience will kneel

34
00:01:19.466 --> 00:01:22.266
The project is hands-on, even if it is difficult for him to attack

35
00:01:22.266 --> 00:01:23.366
Desperate

36
00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:25.300
Can't keep you

37
00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:27.266
How dare you be so sure?

38
00:01:27.266 --> 00:01:28.866
I talk to Dr. Shi

39
00:01:28.866 --> 00:01:31.100
He is an important minister in front of today's holy reward

40
00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:32.933
Self-identification is unusual

41
00:01:32.933 --> 00:01:33.733
If you

42
00:01:33.733 --> 00:01:36.733
There really is evidence of identity that can make people happy

43
00:01:36.733 --> 00:01:38.900
Then why didn't you prove it earlier?

44
00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:40.733
The imperial historian was right

45
00:01:40.733 --> 00:01:42.900
If you can really prove your identity

46
00:01:42.933 --> 00:01:45.933
And he pulled it out for us to see.

47
00:01:45.933 --> 00:01:47.400
Take it out take it out

48
00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:48.200
Hey

49
00:01:48.566 --> 00:01:50.166
Why do you say this, my lords?

50
00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:51.300
In my opinion

51
00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:54.200
He doesn't have any great identity at all

52
00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:56.066
Can command the four generals

53
00:01:56.066 --> 00:01:59.500
I'm afraid it's because of the characters in Nangong Tong

54
00:02:00.566 --> 00:02:03.533
Well, since you don't want to believe it

55
00:02:03.533 --> 00:02:07.200
Then I'll teach you English kung fu to copy your house

56
00:02:07.533 --> 00:02:09.100
In a positive capacity
