1
00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:02.900
Then dare I ask what you mean?

2
00:00:03.066 --> 00:00:05.300
Literally, Lord Mu

3
00:00:05.466 --> 00:00:08.600
I advise you not to push your luck too far.

4
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:11.133
Why don't you dare?

5
00:00:11.133 --> 00:00:15.133
If you need famous origin gas, gold and silver treasures

6
00:00:15.133 --> 00:00:16.600
Just say it.

7
00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.000
We can all be satisfied

8
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.266
But you made me kneel and break my arms

9
00:00:22.266 --> 00:00:23.766
That's impossible

10
00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:27.533
You guys just beat me down and insulted me

11
00:00:27.533 --> 00:00:28.900
Help me with my nine feet

12
00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:30.500
More decisive than now

13
00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.033
Why did I let you cut off your arms?

14
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.833
This can't be done

15
00:00:35.166 --> 00:00:38.366
Mu Guiying, I'm waiting to give you three points of face today.

16
00:00:38.366 --> 00:00:39.966
They all look at Commander Nangong

17
00:00:39.966 --> 00:00:41.666
And the face of the four generals

18
00:00:41.733 --> 00:00:43.500
But you should also know

19
00:00:43.666 --> 00:00:45.066
Be a person and stay on the line

20
00:00:45.066 --> 00:00:46.633
See you later

21
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.033
If you do things too well today

22
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.433
I'm afraid it will end up being criticized by thousands of people

23
00:00:53.733 --> 00:00:54.533
again

24
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.100
Is China

25
00:00:57.666 --> 00:00:59.500
People can do this kind of thing

26
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:02.000
How dare you

27
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.233
Commander Nangong

28
00:01:03.266 --> 00:01:05.566
You are a capable general under the female handsome

29
00:01:05.566 --> 00:01:06.666
Over 10,000 people

30
00:01:06.666 --> 00:01:09.566
I should naturally respect you

31
00:01:09.933 --> 00:01:13.766
But he's here today doing these things.

32
00:01:13.766 --> 00:01:16.766
I'm afraid the capital can't tolerate his boldness

33
00:01:16.966 --> 00:01:19.566
Do you know who to talk to?

34
00:01:21.133 --> 00:01:22.266
Commander Nangong

35
00:01:22.666 --> 00:01:24.200
He is your guest

36
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.400
We should lower our profile

37
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.366
But the dignitaries present at the banquet

38
00:01:28.366 --> 00:01:30.466
All represent the face of the building

39
00:01:30.466 --> 00:01:32.133
You made me wait today.

40
00:01:32.133 --> 00:01:34.766
Kneel down and apologize to this country man

41
00:01:34.866 --> 00:01:37.400
It's humiliating the face of the building

42
00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.566
Dare to ask female handsome of the same age

43
00:01:40.266 --> 00:01:42.000
Know this
