00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:03.100
Boy, don't talk nonsense

2
00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:04.766
Do you know the cause of flower old age?

3
00:00:04.766 --> 00:00:06.100
It's right here.

4
00:00:06.166 --> 00:00:07.700
I already know

5
00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:10.333
Chen Hao, are you sure you can cure Old Hua's disease?

6
00:00:10.333 --> 00:00:12.800
I'm sure of the financial resources, I believe in Chen Hao

7
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.200
He's not the type to talk big.

8
00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:15.300
Trust him sooner or later

9
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:16.166
I believed him.

10
00:00:16.166 --> 00:00:18.366
Chen Hao, my grandfather will ask you

11
00:00:19.566 --> 00:00:21.866
Who wouldn't say such a big talk, kid?

12
00:00:21.866 --> 00:00:25.566
If you have any art, dare to say acupuncture to Teacher Hua

13
00:00:25.866 --> 00:00:26.666
acupuncture

14
00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.200
Hahaha, traditional Chinese medicine.

15
00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.733
Something that cheats money by pretending to be a ghost

16
00:00:32.733 --> 00:00:34.666
I'm too embarrassed to say that I cure patients and save people.

17
00:00:34.666 --> 00:00:36.766
I heard that in China

18
00:00:36.766 --> 00:00:39.866
Traditional Chinese medicine is like a divine stick who dances the great sage

19
00:00:40.066 --> 00:00:40.900
It means the same thing.

20
00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:42.866
Professor Weir is right

21
00:00:42.866 --> 00:00:44.800
This kind of thing should have been eliminated long ago

22
00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.100
But there are always some bad liars

23
00:00:47.133 --> 00:00:49.700
Specifically use him to deceive those who don't navigate

24
00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:51.700
Make money

25
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.600
Which saint and which concern of traditional Chinese and Western medicine is still unknown?

26
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.633
Mr. Zheng, please be careful

27
00:00:56.933 --> 00:00:59.266
Miss Ye is right

28
00:00:59.266 --> 00:01:02.100
There is no need for such a liar to have strength, right?

29
00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.600
If this gentleman is so confident

30
00:01:04.666 --> 00:01:06.900
Do you dare to bet with me?

31
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:07.933
Let's bet!

32
00:01:07.933 --> 00:01:10.700
So if I can't cure the eight old men

33
00:01:10.733 --> 00:01:12.000
I'll pay for it myself

34
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
But if I'm cured

35
00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:18.066
Mr. Zheng also has half of the family property that can be given to Mr. Hua

36
00:01:18.066 --> 00:01:20.900
Okay, that's what you said.

37
00:01:21.166 --> 00:01:24.000
When I have someone cut off your hands later

38
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.466
Miss Ye can't save you either

39
00:01:25.466 --> 00:01:28.166
Then please ask this gentleman

40
00:01:28.266 --> 00:01:29.566
You go first
