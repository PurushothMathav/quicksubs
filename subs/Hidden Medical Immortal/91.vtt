00:00:00.766 --> 00:00:04.566
If you can't afford it, then don't play it. Oh, okay, dear brother.

2
00:00:04.566 --> 00:00:06.900
Don't be angry.

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.466
You can't be fine anyway.

4
00:00:19.266 --> 00:00:20.700
Hahahaha

5
00:00:21.066 --> 00:00:24.400
Mr. Hua, are you in a hurry to seek medical attention?

6
00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.000
Although this piece looks green from the window

7
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.500
But there are too many cracks

8
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.566
It is impossible to prescribe good materials

9
00:00:31.133 --> 00:00:34.166
I suggest you choose another piece. It's true.

10
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.800
Flowers are doomed to lose

11
00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.566
But you're a beautiful woman

12
00:00:37.566 --> 00:00:39.200
I'm going to lose so ugly

13
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.200
No, I'll take this one.

14
00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.800
Since the flowers have been selected, let's bloom them.

15
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.233
It's a glass window

16
00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:05.400
Still of high quality

17
00:01:05.866 --> 00:01:07.600
Look at the good quality.

18
00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.200
Check it out again.

19
00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.666
Although Mr. Gao's piece is also a glass bead

20
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.233
But medium quality

21
00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:17.300
This round

22
00:01:18.166 --> 00:01:19.033
Hua Zongsheng

23
00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:21.900
How is that possible?
