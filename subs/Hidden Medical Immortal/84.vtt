00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:01.866
Zhengjin, how is it you?

2
00:00:01.966 --> 00:00:03.700
Where is Zhengyuan, my brother?

3
00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:05.933
He has important business to attend to personally

4
00:00:05.933 --> 00:00:08.266
I'm coming to the stone betting contest tonight

5
00:00:10.866 --> 00:00:12.400
Chen Hao, that rascal dog is here again

6
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:13.600
Officially going abroad tonight

7
00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:15.333
Hosted by this stone gambling event

8
00:00:15.333 --> 00:00:17.200
But I'm going to fool the whole Linhai City

9
00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:18.500
So brilliant

10
00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:20.933
The hillbilly is still licking his face

11
00:00:20.933 --> 00:00:22.166
So shameless

12
00:00:22.166 --> 00:00:25.033
I heard that he opened three top-quality jadeites in a row last time

13
00:00:25.066 --> 00:00:26.400
I also won Mr. Hua

14
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.400
If he is really a stone gambling genius

15
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:29.366
Sows can climb trees

16
00:00:29.366 --> 00:00:30.366
That's pretty good.

17
00:00:30.366 --> 00:00:32.466
This little white face is just a joke

18
00:00:32.466 --> 00:00:34.066
If you open the rough stone again tonight

19
00:00:34.066 --> 00:00:35.300
Absolutely embarrassing

20
00:00:36.333 --> 00:00:37.133
Hello

21
00:00:37.733 --> 00:00:39.000
These rough stone materials

22
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.333
I personally shipped it back from Myanmar.

23
00:00:41.333 --> 00:00:43.633
I'm sure everyone will have a pack of cigarettes tonight

24
00:00:44.366 --> 00:00:45.500
Oh, by the way, Mr. Hua

25
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:46.766
With your ability

26
00:00:46.766 --> 00:00:48.933
Tonight's title of gambling king belongs to you

27
00:00:48.933 --> 00:00:50.633
Mr. Zheng's ability is also good

28
00:00:50.866 --> 00:00:53.100
Why don't you and I take a gamble first

29
00:00:53.133 --> 00:00:55.166
You are the queen of the gambling pool

30
00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:56.800
I have this ability

31
00:00:57.533 --> 00:00:59.733
Forget it, you have foresight

32
00:00:59.733 --> 00:01:01.666
Since flowers are always so elegant

33
00:01:01.666 --> 00:01:04.300
Just tonight I hired another gambling king

34
00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:05.800
Why don't you let him accompany you to the gambling king?

35
00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.000
Who is the other gambling king?
