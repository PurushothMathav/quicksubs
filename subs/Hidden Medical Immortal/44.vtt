00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:01.700
Chen Hao and so on

2
00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:04.900
When will you come to owe me?

3
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.100
In a week.

4
00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:07.300
Did you keep it for so long?

5
00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:09.233
Your body is basically healed.

6
00:00:09.266 --> 00:00:10.300
I'll go first

7
00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:12.766
Right, right.

8
00:00:12.766 --> 00:00:14.533
I preconfigured you for self-defense

9
00:00:14.533 --> 00:00:17.166
It's safe from evil and safe for me

10
00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:19.033
OK

11
00:00:20.333 --> 00:00:21.500
I'll go first

12
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.700
This guy really cares about me

13
00:00:32.166 --> 00:00:33.700
You are Dr. Chen

14
00:00:33.866 --> 00:00:35.900
You are Secha Black Tiger

15
00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.266
I heard that you cured Ye Xiaojie's terminal illness

16
00:00:38.266 --> 00:00:39.966
Medical skills are unparalleled in the world

17
00:00:39.966 --> 00:00:42.233
I have a brother who has been paralyzed looking for

18
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.600
Please save him

19
00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.633
I don't have a medical license

20
00:00:47.333 --> 00:00:49.066
Those who are capable don't need it

21
00:00:49.066 --> 00:00:51.500
An incompetent person, he has a certificate, he is also a quack

22
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.633
Just because you cured Miss Ye's disease

23
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.566
It is enough to prove that you are a real person.

24
00:00:56.766 --> 00:00:59.000
Lead the way

25
00:01:03.333 --> 00:01:04.733
Brother Tiger, forget it

26
00:01:04.733 --> 00:01:06.466
I can't fix my leg.

27
00:01:06.533 --> 00:01:08.100
What did the daughter-in-law say?

28
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.400
Dr. Chen is a peerless doctor

29
00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:10.333
He will cure you

30
00:01:10.333 --> 00:01:12.100
Trust Brother Tiger again, okay?

31
00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.533
Hmph, so many peerless doctors have not been cured

32
00:01:14.533 --> 00:01:16.766
I'm still so young to do it

33
00:01:16.766 --> 00:01:19.133
Spinal injury leads to lumbar paralysis

34
00:01:19.133 --> 00:01:19.933
you

35
00:01:20.333 --> 00:01:23.100
Dr. Chen, can you cure me?
