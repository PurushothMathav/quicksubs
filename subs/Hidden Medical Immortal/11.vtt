1
00:00:05.966 --> 00:00:07.566
Your Yin Sand Qi has been collected by me

2
00:00:07.566 --> 00:00:09.033
This jade pendant cannot be used.

3
00:00:10.666 --> 00:00:11.566
Catch ghosts

4
00:00:11.566 --> 00:00:12.900
What yin and yang

5
00:00:12.933 --> 00:00:13.600
Why can't I see?

6
00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:14.766
You are mortal with naked eyes

7
00:00:14.766 --> 00:00:15.733
Of course not.

8
00:00:15.733 --> 00:00:18.733
It's normal, since you can understand my yin evil

9
00:00:18.733 --> 00:00:20.600
Then can I treat Han Zheng?

10
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:21.500
That's easier

11
00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:22.300
Chen Hao

12
00:00:23.133 --> 00:00:26.133
Miss Ye, he is just a charlatan

13
00:00:26.133 --> 00:00:28.200
The magic stick who wants to get your attention

14
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.466
Your Han Zhenglian, Dean Zhao and Dr. Shu

15
00:00:31.533 --> 00:00:32.400
Can't be cured

16
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.766
He said it was easy

17
00:00:35.733 --> 00:00:37.933
Miss Chen Haoye's status is extraordinary

18
00:00:37.933 --> 00:00:40.300
His natural Han Zheng is very tricky

19
00:00:40.333 --> 00:00:42.300
You can't cure him by giving him hope now

20
00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.566
The consequences are something you can't afford

21
00:00:43.566 --> 00:00:45.466
Miss, I think this person is 80% a liar

22
00:00:45.466 --> 00:00:47.166
He can't deceive you by looking at the evil in front of him

23
00:00:47.166 --> 00:00:48.600
I just want to deceive you with Zhihan Zheng

24
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.600
Han Zheng treated by burning volcanoes

25
00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:51.466
Can be cured

26
00:00:51.466 --> 00:00:53.400
If you don't believe me, you can try it.

27
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:54.766
Burning volcanoes I have used

28
00:00:54.766 --> 00:00:57.166
I didn't think about it, hahaha.

29
00:00:57.466 --> 00:00:59.466
A piece of trash can't hold it, right?

30
00:00:59.533 --> 00:01:01.766
Dr. Su said your method doesn't work

31
00:01:01.766 --> 00:01:04.133
Hey, you said you're not a liar.

32
00:01:04.133 --> 00:01:05.733
I'm talking about old-fashioned young women

33
00:01:05.733 --> 00:01:08.066
He said that the ancient young woman has long been lost

34
00:01:08.066 --> 00:01:09.233
You spent a few years in prison

35
00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.233
It will, if you can make it out today

36
00:01:12.333 --> 00:01:14.266
I will call you dad

37
00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.400
This is the bullet command pin.
