00:00:04.366 --> 00:00:07.266
Then you finally came, do you think the world will be

2
00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.533
Don't panic, do you have his stuff on you?

3
00:00:09.533 --> 00:00:11.433
On you

4
00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:12.866
I have his marriage certificate

5
00:00:13.733 --> 00:00:14.533
give

6
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:18.733
Okay, I'll go find him.

7
00:00:18.733 --> 00:00:20.866
You don't even know where he is, how are you going to find him?

8
00:00:20.866 --> 00:00:23.833
Don't worry, I have my own way to show you something good.

9
00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:25.600
Hold it for me

10
00:00:31.333 --> 00:00:33.633
Why don't you go to the police station first?

11
00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.100
Didn't you promise my father would die?

12
00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.066
Why was he still cured by Chen Hao?

13
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.466
That bastard Chen Hao again

14
00:00:51.466 --> 00:00:54.300
Bad my good deeds twice

15
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.766
But Mr. Lin, please rest assured.

16
00:00:55.766 --> 00:00:58.366
What if he broke?

17
00:00:58.366 --> 00:01:02.033
The people from Ghost King Sect have sent the shadow killer over

18
00:01:02.133 --> 00:01:02.933
This time, Lin

19
00:01:02.933 --> 00:01:06.166
There is absolutely no chance of that kid Howe surviving

20
00:01:06.166 --> 00:01:09.166
I'll kill your father for you after we're done

21
00:01:09.166 --> 00:01:11.666
Isn't the Di Group still yours?

22
00:01:11.666 --> 00:01:14.666
Okay, I'll believe you again.

23
00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:16.500
This time if you

24
00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:20.400
Hello

25
00:01:21.166 --> 00:01:22.100
What!

26
00:01:22.733 --> 00:01:24.466
Yingzi killer lost contact
