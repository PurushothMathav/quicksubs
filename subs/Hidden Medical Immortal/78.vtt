00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:01.200
Bosses

2
00:00:01.333 --> 00:00:04.866
The starting price of this century-old wild ginseng 500,000

3
00:00:04.866 --> 00:00:07.000
Each bid is not less than 100,000

4
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.966
Start bidding now

5
00:00:09.133 --> 00:00:10.766
It's my fifth time now.

6
00:00:10.766 --> 00:00:11.366
Urgent need for approval

7
00:00:11.366 --> 00:00:13.000
The last six 700,000

8
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.066
800,000 5 million

00:00:15.733 --> 00:00:16.900
5 million

10
00:00:17.566 --> 00:00:20.133
Damn 5 million buy a ginseng

11
00:00:20.133 --> 00:00:21.566
This little white face flower

12
00:00:21.566 --> 00:00:24.733
Miss Ye's money is really not distressed

13
00:00:24.733 --> 00:00:25.700
Shameless

14
00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:27.166
The soft rice is eaten so neatly

15
00:00:27.166 --> 00:00:28.566
I'm not afraid to choke you to death

16
00:00:28.566 --> 00:00:30.900
Why did you have to pay a high price in the first place?

17
00:00:31.066 --> 00:00:33.700
Everyone keeps the funds to buy the highest price behind it.

18
00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:36.500
I pay a high price now, and basically no one competes with me.

19
00:00:37.533 --> 00:00:40.066
I didn't expect you to know a lot about business?

20
00:00:40.066 --> 00:00:41.300
5 million time

21
00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:43.466
5 million twice

22
00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.033
5 million three times

23
00:00:46.333 --> 00:00:49.800
Done. Congratulations to this gentleman on getting this single item.

24
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.900
This next item is bronze nectar.

25
00:00:53.766 --> 00:00:55.766
Although a single furnace has passed for more than 300 years

26
00:00:55.766 --> 00:00:57.900
But there is still a faint medicinal fragrance

27
00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:00.800
The starting price for this single item 1 million

28
00:01:00.866 --> 00:01:03.033
Minimum price increase 200,000

29
00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.133
Auction now

30
00:01:05.133 --> 00:01:06.200
1 million start

31
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.100
Looks like I can pick up enough today

32
00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:11.000
Okay, 10 million for a broken stove

33
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.900
This little white face is crazy

34
00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:13.600
This grandson

35
00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.833
He actually took Miss Ye's money to pretend to be an uncle here

36
00:01:15.866 --> 00:01:17.400
Is Miss Ye suffering from evil?

37
00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.200
Hurry up and slap his family

38
00:01:19.933 --> 00:01:21.433
10 million times

39
00:01:22.533 --> 00:01:25.633
10 million 2 times 10,003,000

40
00:01:29.133 --> 00:01:32.000
20 million at a time 30 million
