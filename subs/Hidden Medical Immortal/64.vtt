00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:06.100
Where have you been all morning?

2
00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.100
You look pissed.

3
00:00:08.533 --> 00:00:09.633
Don't mess with you.

4
00:00:09.766 --> 00:00:11.100
Not that Chen Hao

5
00:00:12.333 --> 00:00:14.766
I paid a billion to ask him to lend me the power of the world

6
00:00:14.766 --> 00:00:15.833
He doesn't give

7
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.433
Insatiable guy

8
00:00:17.566 --> 00:00:19.800
If grandpa hadn't called me yesterday and said

9
00:00:19.866 --> 00:00:20.466
Family difficulties

10
00:00:20.466 --> 00:00:21.800
Need the power of the world to save

11
00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.100
I just went to find him

12
00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.400
What, you pay 1 billion to borrow hourly orders from him?

13
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.566
Chen Hao is not the kind of person who is greedy for money

14
00:00:28.566 --> 00:00:30.333
You take money to humiliate him

15
00:00:30.333 --> 00:00:31.600
Of course he won't lend it to you

16
00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.066
No, you told me

17
00:00:33.066 --> 00:00:34.600
People from the temporary group came to see him

18
00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:35.900
Did you give the whole 10 million fee?

19
00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:37.166
That's not greed.

20
00:00:37.166 --> 00:00:39.600
You don't know Chen Hao too well

21
00:00:40.366 --> 00:00:41.733
Oops, forget it.

22
00:00:41.733 --> 00:00:43.266
Don't mess with him yet

23
00:00:43.266 --> 00:00:45.266
I'll explain it to him for you later.

24
00:00:49.866 --> 00:00:52.233
Sir, do you want me to kill him?

25
00:00:52.366 --> 00:00:54.766
No need to be arrogant

26
00:00:54.933 --> 00:00:56.566
Very stinky woman is annoying

27
00:00:56.566 --> 00:00:58.566
But he won't die, will he?

28
00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.066
What's wrong with Sister Wenqiu?

29
00:01:05.066 --> 00:01:06.800
Chen Hao, he was married and born

30
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:07.933
What's wrong with him?

31
00:01:07.933 --> 00:01:09.533
Marry me and call him have never been able to get through

32
00:01:09.533 --> 00:01:10.533
I contact his colleague

33
00:01:10.533 --> 00:01:12.033
His colleague hesitated

34
00:01:12.066 --> 00:01:13.566
Said it was like a mission

35
00:01:13.933 --> 00:01:15.200
I'm a little worried about him

36
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.500
Before thinking about it

37
00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.433
You said there was something evil about him

38
00:01:18.466 --> 00:01:19.966
So how long have I been missing him?

39
00:01:19.966 --> 00:01:21.500
More than three hours. Okay.

40
00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:22.300
You stay there

41
00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:23.866
I'll go find you now

42
00:01:23.866 --> 00:01:25.700
Then I'll go home and wait for you. Hurry up.
