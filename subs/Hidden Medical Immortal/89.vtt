00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:01.200
OK

2
00:00:01.733 --> 00:00:05.833
If Mr. Gao loses the bet, 110 million

3
00:00:07.766 --> 00:00:08.566
OK

4
00:00:09.466 --> 00:00:12.500
Then Mr. Hua is ready to worship the teacher for tea

5
00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:13.166
everyone

6
00:00:13.166 --> 00:00:16.466
The next stone game starts in 10 minutes

7
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.233
Everyone take a break

8
00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:22.033
Caiyun, why are you still betting with him?

9
00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:24.966
That disgusting ghost surnamed Gao is disgusting

10
00:00:24.966 --> 00:00:26.433
He should have some strength

11
00:00:26.566 --> 00:00:28.266
You shouldn't have voted for King Luo

12
00:00:28.933 --> 00:00:30.966
I'll borrow the doll from you, Chen Haoyong

13
00:00:33.133 --> 00:00:33.733
Ah!

14
00:00:33.733 --> 00:00:36.766
Do you want to pick up Chen Hao to help you adjust the rough stones?

15
00:00:36.766 --> 00:00:38.866
Yeah, I figured it out last time.

16
00:00:38.933 --> 00:00:40.600
No matter how lucky a person is

17
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.400
It is impossible to open the jadeite three times in a row

18
00:00:42.666 --> 00:00:44.133
So last time I decided

19
00:00:44.133 --> 00:00:46.033
Chen Hao must be an urban expert

20
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.300
Caiyun, you look up to him too much, right?

21
00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:50.366
Can he beat you?

22
00:00:50.366 --> 00:00:52.000
Totally shit luck

23
00:00:52.266 --> 00:00:54.100
Last time I played with him, I invited him here

24
00:00:54.133 --> 00:00:55.866
How do you want to push three and four?

25
00:00:55.966 --> 00:00:58.166
You put your hopes in him

26
00:00:58.166 --> 00:01:01.566
In case the method you taught me is really useful

27
00:01:01.566 --> 00:01:03.833
I can sense the aura. What if?

28
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.166
Chen Hao will definitely help Caiyun win
