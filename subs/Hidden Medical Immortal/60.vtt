00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:06.966
Are you in space too?

00:00:06.966 --> 00:00:09.466
Xiao Ai, go find someone to arrange it, don't bother.

3
00:00:09.466 --> 00:00:10.500
I can do it myself

4
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:11.700
How can that work?

5
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.466
It's better to be warmer at home

6
00:00:13.466 --> 00:00:14.633
Can't make do with it

7
00:00:16.533 --> 00:00:17.566
Go get ready

8
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.766
The sofa was robbed

9
00:00:26.866 --> 00:00:28.633
Ok, thanks.

10
00:00:28.866 --> 00:00:30.400
Hey, Sister Muxiu, you are here

11
00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:31.966

13
00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.400
No, I'm ready.

14
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:36.566
Uh, that Muxiu sister

15
00:00:36.566 --> 00:00:38.666

16
00:00:38.666 --> 00:00:39.533
This curtain

17
00:00:39.533 --> 00:00:40.333
And that light

18
00:00:40.866 --> 00:00:42.366
Did you prepare this?

19
00:00:43.166 --> 00:00:44.600
Yeah these

20
00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:45.333

21
00:00:45.333 --> 00:00:48.033
Designed by the world's top design teams

22
00:00:48.133 --> 00:00:49.300
And this mural.

23
00:00:49.733 --> 00:00:51.800

24
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.500
Bought it for 100 million

25
00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:55.900
