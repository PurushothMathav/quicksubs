00:00:01.066 --> 00:00:02.666
Mr. Chen, your stone is wasted.

2
00:00:02.666 --> 00:00:03.600
Nothing.

3
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.300
Great. Thanks.

4
00:00:05.966 --> 00:00:09.500
Chen Hao, why didn't the rough stone you picked grow?

5
00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:12.133
I'm impulsive, I'm impulsive

6
00:00:12.133 --> 00:00:13.700
I told you he beat you last time

7
00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:14.966
Totally stepped on shit luck

8
00:00:14.966 --> 00:00:16.000
You just don't listen

9
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.200
You have to pin all your hopes on him

10
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.666
Then how could such a person possibly survive?

11
00:00:21.366 --> 00:00:22.200
Chen Hao

12
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.466
Did you deliberately pick a piece of scrap?

13
00:00:25.466 --> 00:00:27.200
Yes, I'm experimenting.

14
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:28.366
That's fine.

15
00:00:28.366 --> 00:00:30.433
I knew your ability didn't disappear

16
00:00:30.466 --> 00:00:31.166
Chen Hao

17
00:00:31.166 --> 00:00:33.500
Can you help Caiyun pick three rough stones?

18
00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.766
Forget me, can you wake up?

19
00:00:35.766 --> 00:00:37.200
Don't listen to him

20
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.766
He doesn't have the ability to see at all

21
00:00:39.766 --> 00:00:41.333
Beat your face and make you fat here

22
00:00:41.333 --> 00:00:43.066
Even if you force him to help

23
00:00:43.066 --> 00:00:44.500
Caiyun will definitely lose

24
00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:45.600
Forget it, honey.

25
00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:47.100
I think it's up to you to come forward

26
00:00:47.133 --> 00:00:48.700
Help Caiyun cancel the game

27
00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:50.133
Although I lost some face

28
00:00:50.133 --> 00:00:52.500
But it's better than treating that guy like a master

29
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.866
I'll help you, you don't have that ability.

30
00:00:54.866 --> 00:00:56.000
Don't harm people's wealth

31
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.500
And if I win?

32
00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.166
You're a jerk.

33
00:00:59.166 --> 00:01:00.633
Who provoked him with dim sum?

34
00:01:02.166 --> 00:01:04.766
Ah, let's make a bet too

35
00:01:04.966 --> 00:01:06.433
If you lose

36
00:01:06.566 --> 00:01:08.800
You have to agree to one request without conditions

37
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.333
OK, so if I win

38
00:01:11.333 --> 00:01:13.066
You come to me as a babysitter for a month

39
00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:14.666
What nanny?

40
00:01:15.166 --> 00:01:16.166
Are you crazy?

41
00:01:16.166 --> 00:01:17.366
What qualifications do you have to let me marry you?

42
00:01:17.366 --> 00:01:18.500
Brother will be your nanny

43
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:19.666
Can you afford it?

44
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.033
If you can't afford it, don't play it.
