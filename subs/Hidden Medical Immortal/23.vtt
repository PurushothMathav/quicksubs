Congratulations. Congratulations. Thank you.

2
00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:06.066
Thank you, distinguished guests

3
00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:07.733
Come to our engagement ceremony

4
00:00:07.733 --> 00:00:08.966
You may not know

5
00:00:08.966 --> 00:00:10.466
Belle's ex-boyfriend Chen Hao

6
00:00:10.466 --> 00:00:12.500
He's a misbehaved convict.

7
00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:19.266
Belle

8
00:00:19.266 --> 00:00:21.700
I rescued it from this garbage.

9
00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:23.233
So I love him very much.

10
00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.266
I have an announcement to make today.

11
00:00:25.266 --> 00:00:28.100
Johnson & Johnson Medical Technology Limited

12
00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:29.633
Academic official application

13
00:00:29.966 --> 00:00:31.900
Completely ban Chen Hao

14
00:00:34.566 --> 00:00:37.600
Chen Hao is the ring that treated Wan Wan

15
00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.066
It's cheap while Wanwan

16
00:00:39.066 --> 00:00:40.133
That's the guy.

17
00:00:40.133 --> 00:00:42.866
I also heard that Miss Ye is also interested in him

18
00:00:42.866 --> 00:00:43.766
Nice

19
00:00:44.533 --> 00:00:46.066
Your son is doing a great job.

20
00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:47.433
Thank you for the compliment

21
00:00:52.966 --> 00:00:54.800
Hey, isn't that Chen Hao?

22
00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.466
Do you still have the face to eat here?

23
00:00:56.466 --> 00:00:58.400
You immoral prison

24
00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.133
You are so reasonable.

25
00:01:00.133 --> 00:01:01.800
You still have the face to come to a place like this

26
00:01:02.766 --> 00:01:04.400
He is Chen Hao.

27
00:01:04.933 --> 00:01:06.466
Dressed like a beggar

28
00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.866
People are engaged and they come to haunt

29
00:01:08.866 --> 00:01:11.466
Be rude, Dr. Lin is right

30
00:01:11.466 --> 00:01:13.466
This kind of waste should be banned

31
00:01:13.466 --> 00:01:16.366
Our hospital was the first to support Director Huang

32
00:01:16.366 --> 00:01:18.600
You are so sanctimonious

33
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.900
Shut up and criticize sanctimonious people like you.

34
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.600
I call this justice

35
00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:25.800
justice

36
00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.466
Since you said so

37
00:01:28.466 --> 00:01:31.500
Then let me ask you about a person who cheated before marriage

38
00:01:31.666 --> 00:01:34.500
Does it count as moral cover? Naturally, it is moral corruption

39
00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.766
I'm waiting for your words.
