1
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.366
Success, go out for a walk, go fast

2
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:13.800
Chen Hao, you trash just played me

3
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.533
You should back off when it comes to framing me

4
00:00:16.533 --> 00:00:19.200
Give it to me, brothers

5
00:00:25.166 --> 00:00:26.400
You?

6
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:29.400
I'm telling you it's illegal for me to kill

7
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.766
I give you three days to move out of my house

8
00:00:31.766 --> 00:00:33.300
See you in court

9
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.200
Oops, it's alright.

10
00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:42.433
But you can fight

11
00:00:42.766 --> 00:00:43.733
I'll tell you what.

12
00:00:43.733 --> 00:00:44.966
Engagement party in two days

13
00:00:44.966 --> 00:00:45.966
I let my dad

14
00:00:46.133 --> 00:00:48.266
Use all connections to block this castle

15
00:00:48.333 --> 00:00:52.400
At that time, it will be difficult for him to move an inch in Linhai

16
00:00:58.533 --> 00:01:00.733
What are you doing here to treat Miss Ye for distortion?

17
00:01:00.733 --> 00:01:02.200
Take me to Miss Ye, no need

18
00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.333
The doctor Wu I invited is already treating Wang Wen.

19
00:01:04.333 --> 00:01:05.266
Don't bother you

20
00:01:05.266 --> 00:01:07.100
What, you replaced someone else?

21
00:01:09.333 --> 00:01:10.200
Although you are also a doctor

22
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.133
He is Dr. Wu's art world-renowned

23
00:01:12.133 --> 00:01:14.366
I believe he can cure Wan Wan more than you

24
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.866
Mr. Xu, let me add something.

25
00:01:17.366 --> 00:01:18.333
Our Wu doctor

26
00:01:18.333 --> 00:01:19.766
But we Linhai City

27
00:01:19.766 --> 00:01:21.466
Special member of the Chinese Medicine Association

28
00:01:21.466 --> 00:01:23.166
He practices medicine abroad all year round

29
00:01:23.266 --> 00:01:24.766
Medical management is all over the world

30
00:01:24.766 --> 00:01:26.766
Especially his golden needle of fire

31
00:01:26.766 --> 00:01:28.733
I don't know how many people have been cured of terminal diseases

32
00:01:28.733 --> 00:01:31.800
Did you know that temporarily returning the doctor to the patient is atmospheric?

33
00:01:32.933 --> 00:01:33.933
You're particularly right.

34
00:01:33.933 --> 00:01:35.000
I investigate you

35
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.266
You just got out of prison

36
00:01:36.666 --> 00:01:37.900
Constant loans

37
00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.300
How can I treat a patient without an agreement qualification certificate?

38
00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:42.566
I saw that lady's face and let it go

39
00:01:42.566 --> 00:01:44.700
Don't call the police, get out of here

40
00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:45.666
Don't hurt others

41
00:01:45.933 --> 00:01:47.000
Change camps without permission

42
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.433
At your own risk
