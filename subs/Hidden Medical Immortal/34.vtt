00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.433
Ouch, Mr. Hua, haha forest utensils.

2
00:00:03.766 --> 00:00:06.433
This must be a jadeite that I like to make very much.

3
00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:09.266
Take a look.

4
00:00:19.333 --> 00:00:20.766
You bet on stones?

5
00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:25.033
Stone gambling is a game that costs money

6
00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:26.233
Just him.

7
00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:28.600
How does this play?

8
00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:29.966
Do you think you can turn green?

9
00:00:30.466 --> 00:00:31.633
It should be fine.

10
00:00:32.766 --> 00:00:34.766
It turns out that your kid is fooled

11
00:00:34.933 --> 00:00:38.066
Wan Wan, your friend is very interesting.

12
00:00:38.066 --> 00:00:40.833
For the sake of Wan Wan's face, I will help you choose

13
00:00:43.066 --> 00:00:45.300
I've seen this piece before

14
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.366
And I have 70% of the ability to open arms to the Ming Dynasty

15
00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:50.266
That's definitely good stuff.

16
00:00:50.266 --> 00:00:53.400
Mr. Hua really deserves to be Caiyun Jewelry Group

17
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.166
The chairman's granddaughter?

18
00:00:55.166 --> 00:00:57.700
The one I chose looks better than yours.

19
00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.900
Your rough stone is from Xinkeng City.

20
00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.700
Even if you can line up, you will fight the world

21
00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.166
At most, the account is the bias of the promise

22
00:01:05.466 --> 00:01:09.066
How can you make a bet with someone like me?
