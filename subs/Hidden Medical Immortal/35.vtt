00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.233
If your rough stone

2
00:00:02.266 --> 00:00:04.366
Can offer a higher quality than mine?

3
00:00:04.366 --> 00:00:05.966
I will not only not charge you for the fee.

4
00:00:05.966 --> 00:00:07.900
I'll give you 1 million bet

5
00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:09.633
If you lose

6
00:00:09.766 --> 00:00:11.900
Completely disappear from the evening side

7
00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:13.066
Stop pestering

8
00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:15.233
Good food, Xiao Gu

9
00:00:15.666 --> 00:00:18.400
Take these two rough stones and open them together, Mr. Hua.

10
00:00:19.966 --> 00:00:21.866
This Chen He is so funny

11
00:00:21.966 --> 00:00:23.966
Do you dare to hate you?

12
00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:25.466
He doesn't pee and take pictures of himself

13
00:00:25.466 --> 00:00:26.933
What kind of virtue do you say you are?

14
00:00:26.933 --> 00:00:28.800
Hahahaha

15
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.900
A lowly man floated

16
00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:34.933
Occasionally contact the daughter puppy of a rich family

17
00:00:34.933 --> 00:00:37.833
I feel like my life has reached its peak

18
00:00:37.933 --> 00:00:42.466
A live jumping beam clown, hahaha.

19
00:00:42.466 --> 00:00:44.500
Why is he

20
00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.800
Chen Hao Caiyun has been immersed in casinos for many years

21
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.066
Spicy eyes

22
00:00:54.133 --> 00:00:56.300
You better not gamble, mom

23
00:00:56.566 --> 00:00:58.333
A self-righteous man like this

24
00:00:58.333 --> 00:00:59.966
I suggest you return it as soon as possible.

25
00:00:59.966 --> 00:01:02.066
Before he becomes a joke himself

26
00:01:02.066 --> 00:01:03.233
You also follow the face

27
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.966
Mr. Huahua, the rough stone you picked has opened.

28
00:01:09.166 --> 00:01:11.000
The texture is excellent.

29
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.766
So excellent

30
00:01:11.766 --> 00:01:13.133
And emerald green flowers

31
00:01:13.133 --> 00:01:16.066
This looks like high-quality jadeite.

32
00:01:16.166 --> 00:01:16.966
Shit

33
00:01:17.166 --> 00:01:19.566
You really deserve the title of Queen of Gamblers.

34
00:01:19.566 --> 00:01:21.300
These idiots

35
00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:22.800
I really don't know what to do.

36
00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.766
Hurry up and take the opportunity to escape

37
00:01:24.766 --> 00:01:25.466
Hahaha

38
00:01:25.466 --> 00:01:28.300
In order to wait for a while to open the pile and waste it, it will be embarrassing

39
00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:29.100
kid

40
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.100
I'll give you myself if you give up now

41
00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.466
I can still leave you some wins and losses.

42
00:01:34.466 --> 00:01:35.833
Familiar

43
00:01:36.166 --> 00:01:39.100
You haven't decided yet, Mr. Ba

44
00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:40.666
What are you screaming about?

45
00:01:40.666 --> 00:01:41.633
His original

46
00:01:41.766 --> 00:01:43.066
What happened to him?

47
00:01:43.066 --> 00:01:45.033
Are you so hesitant that you can't even speak?
