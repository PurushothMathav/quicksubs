00:00:05.566 --> 00:00:07.500
I'm sorry about that Muqiu sister.

2
00:00:07.533 --> 00:00:10.866
I mean you go to work after dinner?

3
00:00:10.866 --> 00:00:12.133
I am not thirsty

4
00:00:12.133 --> 00:00:12.966
I have something else to do

5
00:00:12.966 --> 00:00:14.300
I'm leaving first

6
00:00:20.066 --> 00:00:20.866
son

7
00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:23.800
Hey, why are you so stupid?

8
00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:27.133
Such a good opportunity to let him run away?

9
00:00:27.133 --> 00:00:28.600
Mu Xiu is a good woman

10
00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.400
I'm a kid who just got out of prison

11
00:00:31.466 --> 00:00:32.633
What can you give him?

12
00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.333
Oh mom

13
00:00:34.333 --> 00:00:35.500
I read the book first

14
00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:36.866
Let's eat.

15
00:00:37.866 --> 00:00:38.666
OK

16
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.233
Wan Wan, why did you take out the marriage certificate in the first place?

17
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.766
Hey, what's the use of taking it out?

18
00:00:46.766 --> 00:00:48.366
Didn't he still not like it?

19
00:00:48.366 --> 00:00:49.466
What do you mean?

20
00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:51.433
You mean he also rejected you?

21
00:00:53.966 --> 00:00:56.033
Well, sort of.

22
00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.700
How unreasonable

23
00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:00.566
No, why would he want me to say that?

24
00:01:00.566 --> 00:01:02.133
You should have returned the marriage certificate too

25
00:01:02.133 --> 00:01:03.700
As for his courtroom

26
00:01:04.333 --> 00:01:07.233
If you don't see me, you can't return it.

27
00:01:08.733 --> 00:01:10.066
What are you in a hurry?

28
00:01:10.066 --> 00:01:11.833
You shut up

29
00:01:12.733 --> 00:01:13.833
What are you doing here?

30
00:01:16.166 --> 00:01:17.900
Miss, here's your marriage contract

31
00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:19.200
Prompting marriage with me?
