1
00:00:06.666 --> 00:00:08.866
Who are you? Who sent you to die?

2
00:00:08.866 --> 00:00:10.700
One doesn't need to know so many things

3
00:00:13.066 --> 00:00:15.600
Ghost kings, Wang Defu sent you here, right?

4
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.200
You ask him to send more experts

5
00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.200
Now that you know who I am

6
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.566
Then I can't keep you.

7
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:23.133
You've been hiding

8
00:00:23.133 --> 00:00:24.266
Why didn't you fight back?

9
00:00:24.266 --> 00:00:26.900
If I were to make a move, you would already be dead. Arrogant

10
00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.066
This doesn't look like martial arts

11
00:00:34.366 --> 00:00:35.766
Who the hell are you?

12
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.266
You were scared away

13
00:00:42.333 --> 00:00:44.166
This plexus recurs once every half a month

14
00:00:44.166 --> 00:00:46.433
If there is an antidote, it could be the heart

15
00:00:46.533 --> 00:00:47.733
It's a miserable situation

16
00:00:47.733 --> 00:00:49.066
No need to talk nonsense there

17
00:00:49.066 --> 00:00:50.800
You don't care if I live or die

18
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:52.600
Get out if you know

19
00:00:54.333 --> 00:00:54.966
What are you doing?

20
00:00:54.966 --> 00:00:55.900
Just you!

21
00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:57.700
The police know we fought here

22
00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:59.433
It won't be clear by then
