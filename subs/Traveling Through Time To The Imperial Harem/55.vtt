1
00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.980
How dare you question the emperor's will

2
00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.700
Father, do you have to make decisions for your daughter?

3
00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:17.980
The injury is because he rarely came to me this time because you returned to Beijing.

4
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.120
On weekdays, he would rather go to the cold palace to pet the truest daughter

5
00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:25.300
Said he didn't want to come to Lixia Palace to accompany me for one night

6
00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:27.380
My daughter is in pain.

7
00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:30.360
The plague prevails in Emperor Bailing County

8
00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:31.700
The common people are in danger

9
00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:33.240
There has been extreme turmoil

10
00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:34.720
If you let it go

11
00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:35.940
Fear of disaster

12
00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:39.920
Emperor

13
00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.460
Is it suitable outside?

14
00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:46.200
Return to the emperor's court

15
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.860
They are all looking for a way to be comfortable because of the plague in Bailing County

16
00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:56.660
It is recommended to send a fire messenger from the capital that can represent the royal family to Bailing County to appease Min County

17
00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:57.620
nonsense

18
00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.620
Whoever goes is not going to die

19
00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:02.180
Just say I'm in a hurry

20
00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:03.220
See you another day

21
00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.960
Please tell the general

22
00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.820
There are many royal relatives who have turned over the crime of beheading in this prison

23
00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:12.440
Instead of closing

24
00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:14.520
It's better to just shoot one at random.

25
00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.600
This will not only make up for the mistakes

26
00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.000
It can also convince people of their memories

27
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.060
There's a two-way solution.

28
00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.140
Well, let them decide for themselves first.

29
00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.580
Wait until my headache is gone before saying um

30
00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.920
plague

31
00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.700
The deadliest plague of our time

32
00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:36.660
Is it smallpox?
