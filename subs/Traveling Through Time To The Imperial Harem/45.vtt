00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:05.120
See the tax and silver in the fourteen southern states that Emperor Aiqing and Ning Ranchen secretly investigated?

2
00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:06.820
It's settled

3
00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:08.200
Report to the Emperor

4
00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:10.500
The disaster food in the south is ready

5
00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.020
Good yeah

6
00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:19.580
I got off the boat and went back to the bedroom, and I'm still so busy

7
00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.500
Does it take a 24-hour lunch break to be an emperor?

8
00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:34.180
Oh wow.

9
00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:38.620
Is this the legendary jade seal?

10
00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:40.260
It looks like this

11
00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:42.580
Ah!

12
00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.040
Wow, so much!

13
00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.260
If this were my hand, I'd have to break it.

14
00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:50.620
Your injury is not healed yet.

15
00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.940
I just want my head to move

16
00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:55.940
Ahhh what

17
00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.860
You said you want my head to move, but I'm not running yet?

18
00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:02.920
If you really offend me

19
00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:04.300
The world is so big

20
00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:05.660
Where are you going?

21
00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:09.280
It is the king of the whole country

22
00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:10.300
However, the emperor

23
00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.200
You are so busy

24
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.240
I still have time to pretend to be a guard and come to the cold palace to tease me

25
00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.220
I'm not pretending

26
00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.100
When did I not wear a sundress?

27
00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:23.040
You don't wear dragon robes and wander around in plain clothes. What's the matter?

28
00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.540
You think dragon robes are easy to wear

29
00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:26.380
Dozens of floors inside and out

30
00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:27.860
You want to plant dead people?

31
00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.940
Hmm, let's talk about it

32
00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.460
I went to the cold palace at night

33
00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.700
Sleep with your concubine

34
00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.140
How can you just wander around?

35
00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:39.600
Ah!

36
00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.520
My back hurts and my butt hurts.

37
00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:43.820
Your Majesty, I will lie down first
