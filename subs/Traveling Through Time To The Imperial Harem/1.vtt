00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:02.700
All right.

2
00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:03.766
Don't go.

3
00:00:03.766 --> 00:00:04.480
hate

4
00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:05.200
Very safe

5
00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.040
Take it easy

6
00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:08.340
Tap tap

7
00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:10.500
This is the emperor

8
00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:11.680
What the hell

9
00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:13.820
Fortunately, I was already thrown into the cold palace.

10
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.860
This homemade telescope can see quite clearly

11
00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:21.900
Sure to sell for a good price

12
00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:23.766
Transcend to

13
00:00:23.766 --> 00:00:26.260
It's been more than half a year here.

14
00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:28.760
The money saved from leaving the palace is almost the same

15
00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:30.500
It's time to plan

16
00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:32.180
Take a sip

17
00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:35.040
What are you reading?

18
00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.700
The emperor is in the bridal chamber

19
00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:39.140
Uh-huh.

20
00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:41.900
Ah!

21
00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.100
I asked what are you looking at?

22
00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.800
Ah!

23
00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:01.940
Shh! Quiet!

24
00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.532
If the emperor finds out, we will both be doomed

25
00:01:04.532 --> 00:01:04.940
Emperor

26
00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.320
Since you know it's the emperor, you still dare to peek

27
00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.460
Don't worry.

28
00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:13.320
Oh, you see it now?

29
00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.333
It's a big deal, let's kill the head together

30
00:01:15.333 --> 00:01:16.220
What is this?

31
00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:17.740
You can see clearly from so far

32
00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:19.040
Hum let me tell you

33
00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:20.740
The emperor can't do that

34
00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.799
Well, how do you know that?

35
00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:25.100
I saw it.

36
00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.280
It's over in 1 minute

37
00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:29.340
No no no no

38
00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:34.199
Little Guard

39
00:01:34.199 --> 00:01:37.740
I have an out-of-print Spring Palace map

40
00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.280
Definitely better than live streaming

41
00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:44.666
Only ten taels of silver

42
00:01:44.666 --> 00:01:45.360
How did it go?

43
00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.180
It's worth it, what a dare

44
00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.300
This kind of thing dares to be brought into the Royal Inner Court

45
00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:50.660
Watch me cut off a woman's head
