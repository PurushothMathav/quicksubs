00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:07.580
The empress dowager clearly saw that it was the concubine's father who said it himself

2
00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:10.020
This Shen Xingyao is a monster

3
00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.780
Except for her, we can solve the world's drought

4
00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:14.760
The night Shen entered the palace

5
00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:15.980
The emperor died

6
00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:17.600
It's really a mismatch.

7
00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.480
It is this Shen Xingyao who is a scourge

8
00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:22.200
Except for her

9
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:23.520
What's going on?

10
00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:25.900
Do you want to sacrifice me to heaven due to the severe drought in the world?

11
00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.340
I'm not Xiao Jingteng

12
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.240
The Empress Dowager's concubine is an ordinary person

13
00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.120
In case the death of a concubine does not solve the world's drought

14
00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.033
Wouldn't that make the world laugh at the stupidity of the royal family?

15
00:00:37.033 --> 00:00:37.860
presumptuous

16
00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.232
Empress Dowager and King Qi ask to see

17
00:00:43.232 --> 00:00:43.820
strange

18
00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.200
The female relatives of King Qi's harem should not see foreign men

19
00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:48.900
Take them in for a break

20
00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.333
Yes

21
00:00:49.333 --> 00:00:50.560
Genius

22
00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:51.480
Pure nonsense

23
00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.060
The emperor is very attentive to Shen shi

24
00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:56.820
Why does King Qi also value Shen shi so much?

25
00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.580
Could it be that King Qi has bad thoughts about her?

26
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.260
I don't dare to, I just think that the drought should not be blamed on a woman

27
00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.620
Does King Qi have a good strategy for governing?

28
00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:15.100
Sharing the emperor's worries is a matter for ministers

29
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.480
I wish to issue a military order

30
00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:18.140
If the drought cannot be solved

31
00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.120
I am willing to hand over the talisman

32
00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:24.460
Hahaha, King Qi is really sincere towards Shen shi.

33
00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.380
Since King Qi is willing to show this limelight

34
00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:28.720
Then I agree.

35
00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:29.760
Within three days

36
00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:31.380
If you can't solve the drought

37
00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.380
I will remove you from the position of vassal

38
00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.840
Drought control within three days

39
00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.300
How could I not let King Qi be punished for me?

40
00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:40.440
that

41
00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.300
The emperor is willing to listen to the concubine
