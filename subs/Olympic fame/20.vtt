00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:02.600
You can lift 400 kilos.

2
00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:05.066
I think you are crazy about taking too much medicine.

3
00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:08.866
Do you think taking medicine can solve all problems?

4
00:00:08.866 --> 00:00:10.900
What brain is shit

5
00:00:10.966 --> 00:00:13.800
Do you know what grade 400kg is?

6
00:00:13.966 --> 00:00:16.566
That's Olympic third place.

7
00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:18.200
Carving things doesn't work

8
00:00:18.666 --> 00:00:20.900
Don't be impulsive with you.

9
00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.266
It's Ruolan, it's a 400kg decade

10
00:00:24.266 --> 00:00:26.333
Even he, Zhao Wanglong, couldn't lift it

11
00:00:26.333 --> 00:00:27.700
What's more, what about you?

12
00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:29.866
Don't be as brave as your father

13
00:00:29.866 --> 00:00:32.566
If you lift it by force, there will be sequelae.

14
00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.866
It will never end again

15
00:00:34.866 --> 00:00:36.433
Dad Principal

16
00:00:36.933 --> 00:00:37.900
Don't worry.

17
00:00:37.966 --> 00:00:39.066
I am measured

18
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.566
I have never weighed less than 400 kilograms in an Olympic competition

19
00:00:43.733 --> 00:00:47.400
Zhao Wanglong, if I lift this 400 kilograms for 10 years

20
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.566
Does that prove that you are slandering me?

21
00:00:50.566 --> 00:00:52.200
Or let me punish you

22
00:00:52.366 --> 00:00:54.666
If you can lift 400 kilos

23
00:00:54.666 --> 00:00:56.633
I will prove your innocence.

24
00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.766
And I'm willing to take your 20 lashes

25
00:00:59.766 --> 00:01:02.966
But if you can't lift it

26
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.933
You and your father are going to get 20 lashes from me

27
00:01:06.933 --> 00:01:09.166
And give me all your belongings

28
00:01:09.166 --> 00:01:11.600
Then get out of Zhaojiacun overnight

29
00:01:11.733 --> 00:01:15.133
Come out and give them your belongings and leave Zhaojiacun

30
00:01:15.133 --> 00:01:17.466
It's okay, don't be impulsive.

31
00:01:17.466 --> 00:01:18.733
Dad, don't worry.

32
00:01:18.733 --> 00:01:20.166
I won't let you down.

33
00:01:20.166 --> 00:01:22.300
Ok I promise you

34
00:01:22.466 --> 00:01:25.166
Keep your eyes open and take a good look
