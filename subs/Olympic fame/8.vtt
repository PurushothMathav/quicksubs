1
00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:02.700
Zhao Daming, don't say we didn't give you a chance?

2
00:00:02.733 --> 00:00:04.200
Now is your chance

3
00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.333
See if you are useful in this trash

4
00:00:06.333 --> 00:00:08.466
Brother, you know my back is hurt

5
00:00:08.466 --> 00:00:09.700
No more weightlifting.

6
00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:11.766
Or you could get killed.

7
00:00:11.766 --> 00:00:13.300
No, no.

8
00:00:14.333 --> 00:00:16.200
Come, let's take a picture and record it.

9
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:17.266
Take a picture. Take a picture.

10
00:00:18.666 --> 00:00:21.400
Second uncle is optimistic

11
00:00:22.133 --> 00:00:24.433
Uh-huh.

12
00:00:26.166 --> 00:00:27.866
Oh, oops, haha.

13
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.666
Hahahaha, oops, that's amazing.

14
00:00:31.666 --> 00:00:33.000
Hahahaha

15
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.966
As expected of an Olympian.

16
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.433
Easily lift 300 kilograms for ten years

17
00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:41.466
My son has a chance to win the third place in the Olympic Games.

18
00:00:41.466 --> 00:00:44.400
The person who brought glory to our armed ancestors

19
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.000
Hmph, uncle, I'm looking at you

20
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.500
It's not that it can't be lifted.

21
00:00:48.666 --> 00:00:50.600
I lost to Gao Qiao Taro that year

22
00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.466
You cowardly Zhao Daming

23
00:00:52.666 --> 00:00:54.800
If you can't lift this ten years

24
00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:55.966
Just get out

25
00:00:56.166 --> 00:00:57.633
Don't embarrass your ancestors

26
00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.533
The heritage of my old Zhao family

27
00:00:59.533 --> 00:01:00.466
My dignity

28
00:01:00.466 --> 00:01:01.733
My daughter's innocence

29
00:01:01.733 --> 00:01:03.666
It's all on my shoulders now

30
00:01:03.666 --> 00:01:05.500
Even if you risk your life today

31
00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.066
I want to protect them too

32
00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.233
I will never

33
00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.666
Mr. Jakes reported it

34
00:01:13.766 --> 00:01:15.233
The player has no problem.

35
00:01:15.266 --> 00:01:18.200
And not only did he break the women's record

36
00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.866
He broke the world record.

37
00:01:20.866 --> 00:01:23.166
What score is no problem?

38
00:01:23.166 --> 00:01:24.800
It's incredible.

39
00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.266
Notify his country

40
00:01:26.266 --> 00:01:29.000
Their player broke the world record

41
00:01:29.966 --> 00:01:32.766
What Olympic champion broke the world record?

42
00:01:32.766 --> 00:01:33.766
In our country

43
00:01:33.766 --> 00:01:36.133
The Olympic champion who broke the world record

44
00:01:36.133 --> 00:01:37.533
In our Tiandong Province

45
00:01:37.533 --> 00:01:39.433
The Olympic champion is in our city of plum blossoms

46
00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.800
What Olympic champion is in our Liuhua County?

47
00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:43.433
He broke the world record.

48
00:01:43.966 --> 00:01:46.600
Get the car ready, I'm going to Zhaojiacun immediately
