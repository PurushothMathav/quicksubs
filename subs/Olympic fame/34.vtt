00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:01.000
You make it clear

2
00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.133
Is that accurate?

3
00:00:02.133 --> 00:00:03.133
Absolutely.

4
00:00:03.133 --> 00:00:05.400
My family works at a highway toll booth

5
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:06.533
He saw it with his own eyes

6
00:00:06.533 --> 00:00:08.800
The International Olympic Committee's car is driving towards our village

7
00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:11.600
The president of the Olympic Committee has come to our village

8
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:13.300
Then there are real dragons in our village?

9
00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:14.900
Hahahaha oops

10
00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:16.433
How about that? Am I right?

11
00:00:16.466 --> 00:00:18.166
Ruolan, he really broke the record

12
00:00:18.166 --> 00:00:21.200
Zhao Ruolan is not only not a disgrace to your village

13
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.966
And ah!

14
00:00:21.966 --> 00:00:24.466
He is the glory of your entire Zhaojia Village.

15
00:00:24.533 --> 00:00:27.233
I believe that in the future, the villagers of Zhaojia Village will

16
00:00:27.266 --> 00:00:28.866
Will be proud of Ruolan

17
00:00:28.866 --> 00:00:30.333
Ruolan, oops.

18
00:00:30.333 --> 00:00:31.733
Just say the fortune tree

19
00:00:31.733 --> 00:00:33.166
I've been watching you since I was a kid

20
00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:34.100
Smart

21
00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:35.300
Haha Village Chief

22
00:00:35.333 --> 00:00:38.500
It is not a good thing for the president of the International Olympic Committee to come to our village

23
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:39.866
It's a bad thing

24
00:00:39.866 --> 00:00:42.600
Zhao Ruolan, he carved things and was taken care of by others

25
00:00:43.266 --> 00:00:44.566
It was in the papers.

26
00:00:44.566 --> 00:00:46.766
That's the biggest stigma of the Olympic Committee.

27
00:00:46.766 --> 00:00:47.166
So

28
00:00:47.166 --> 00:00:49.866
The chairperson of the National Committee came to our village in a rage

29
00:00:49.866 --> 00:00:51.600
Are you here to ask for guilt?

30
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.400
Yes, yes, ask for blame

31
00:00:53.466 --> 00:00:54.166
Us

32
00:00:54.166 --> 00:00:56.333
Quickly distance yourself from this bargain

33
00:00:56.333 --> 00:00:57.500
Lest the time

34
00:00:57.666 --> 00:01:00.266
Forgive our Wanglong for being so

35
00:01:00.466 --> 00:01:02.100
All results are reported

36
00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.966
First place in the women's group

37
00:01:03.966 --> 00:01:05.933
It will be announced in 10 minutes.

38
00:01:05.933 --> 00:01:07.600
Please be patient.
