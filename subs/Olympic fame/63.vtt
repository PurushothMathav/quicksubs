1
00:00:01.866 --> 00:00:02.866
That's fine.

2
00:00:02.866 --> 00:00:05.466
Ma Shoufu is coming to sign a contract with us

3
00:00:05.466 --> 00:00:06.900
Wait until the contract is signed

4
00:00:06.966 --> 00:00:09.966
Let Ma Shoufu clean up you guys

5
00:00:10.866 --> 00:00:14.700
Oh, don't you just sign a contract for the down payment?

6
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.333
Just make a call and we'll find you.

7
00:00:17.333 --> 00:00:19.300
Please make a trip yourself

8
00:00:19.733 --> 00:00:20.533
Yeah.

9
00:00:20.566 --> 00:00:24.466
I also happened to come here to see the championship style

10
00:00:25.066 --> 00:00:28.066
This is my son, who won the Olympics this year.

11
00:00:28.266 --> 00:00:30.766
Just lifted 500 kilograms

12
00:00:30.766 --> 00:00:32.733
Broke the men's record

13
00:00:32.733 --> 00:00:34.766
This 500kg does not count.

14
00:00:34.766 --> 00:00:37.600
No one will break him in the next ten years

15
00:00:37.866 --> 00:00:39.100
500 kg

16
00:00:39.966 --> 00:00:41.900
Hello Ma Xiaoshu

17
00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.300
You are very sincere

18
00:00:43.333 --> 00:00:46.300
I will consider cooperating as a spokesperson

19
00:00:46.566 --> 00:00:48.900
You are a Fuso

20
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.566
Yeah, I was.

21
00:00:50.566 --> 00:00:52.200
However, some Olympic nationalities

22
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.966
And my mother is also Chinese.

23
00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:58.200
Ms. Sun is really a good mother.

24
00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.700
He actually cultivated two Olympic champions

25
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.400
Especially Zhao Ruolan

26
00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.566
Ma Shoufu, are you mistaken?

27
00:01:09.733 --> 00:01:12.666
Zhao Ruolan is not a world champion

28
00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:14.300
He's a bargain

29
00:01:14.466 --> 00:01:18.300
What do you say Zhao Ruolan is a bargain?
