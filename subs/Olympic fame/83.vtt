1
00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:01.966
That's right, Mr. Miyamoto

2
00:00:01.966 --> 00:00:05.466
Zhao Ruolan just lifted 600 kilograms for ten years

3
00:00:05.533 --> 00:00:07.233
Won Takahashi

4
00:00:07.533 --> 00:00:09.733
Olympic Games since Chen Li

5
00:00:09.733 --> 00:00:11.800
Nobody can lift 600 kilos.

6
00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:15.666
Even a man's foot is up to 500 kilograms

7
00:00:15.866 --> 00:00:19.566
Even a genius like Takahashi

8
00:00:19.566 --> 00:00:22.266
Last time, it was also at the advantage of one kilogram.

9
00:00:22.333 --> 00:00:25.500
501Kg won this championship

10
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.166
How could a woman like him lift it?

11
00:00:28.166 --> 00:00:29.133
Liu Pai Senior

12
00:00:29.133 --> 00:00:32.400
I don't even have to check it for you to determine

13
00:00:32.666 --> 00:00:34.466
You eat.

14
00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:35.400
inclusion

15
00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:36.700
Are you frank?

16
00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:38.900
Mr. Miyamoto, if you don't believe me

17
00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:40.900
You can ask the president of the Olympic Committee

18
00:00:41.066 --> 00:00:43.366
I don't need my post-game physical examination results.

19
00:00:43.366 --> 00:00:45.266
There is a problem with 600kg of wine

20
00:00:45.266 --> 00:00:46.900
Give you one last chance

21
00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:48.400
Do you admit to violating the rules?

22
00:00:48.466 --> 00:00:51.700
I don't admit that Mr. Miyamoto requires evidence

23
00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:53.700
You can't open your mouth and say someone is guilty

24
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.866
I'm a performer here.

25
00:00:55.866 --> 00:00:57.900
How dare you explode the super soft product?

26
00:00:58.133 --> 00:01:00.200
What the hell is Armed Curry?

27
00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.900
I'm announcing it right now

28
00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.300
The Olympic organizing committee parried you

29
00:01:06.533 --> 00:01:08.300
Block your way

30
00:01:08.566 --> 00:01:12.833
I will never be able to participate in the Olympic Games again
