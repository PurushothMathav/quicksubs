00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.400
Isn't this Zhao Ruolan's biological mother, Sun Meifeng?

2
00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:03.933
I ran away with the little day

3
00:00:03.933 --> 00:00:05.000
Why did you go back to Zhaojiacun again?

4
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.566
All bejeweled

5
00:00:06.566 --> 00:00:08.700
It seems to be getting along well with the little days

6
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.733
No wonder he abandoned his own daughter in the first place

7
00:00:11.733 --> 00:00:13.566
I also need to help my wife in my childhood

8
00:00:13.566 --> 00:00:15.900
No matter how good I am, so what?

9
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.966
Or the scum of our Zhaojiacun

10
00:00:17.966 --> 00:00:19.733
Shame you have to look down on him

11
00:00:19.733 --> 00:00:21.700
Brother-in-law, why are you back?

12
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:25.066
Shut up!

13
00:00:25.133 --> 00:00:26.433
You loser

14
00:00:26.466 --> 00:00:28.766
I am Gao Qiaotai now

15
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.866
Not your toad woman

16
00:00:30.866 --> 00:00:32.333
Don't get close to me

17
00:00:32.333 --> 00:00:34.100
Mom, how do you hit people?

18
00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:35.400
Bah you bitch

19
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:36.300
I'm not your mother

20
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.466
Don't yell at me

21
00:00:37.533 --> 00:00:39.300
I have but one son.

22
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.966
That's High George

23
00:00:40.966 --> 00:00:42.166
He is outside now

24
00:00:42.166 --> 00:00:45.133
Answer the call from Mr. Miyamoto, Vice President of the Olympic Committee

25
00:00:45.133 --> 00:00:47.666
I'll show you when I come in.

26
00:00:47.666 --> 00:00:50.400
What is a talented person?

27
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.200
It's not cheap or comparable to yours.

28
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.533
Sun didn't let Ruolan go

29
00:00:53.533 --> 00:00:55.000
He is your biological daughter

30
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.066
You abandoned him ten years ago

31
00:00:57.066 --> 00:00:59.166
Now as soon as you come back, hit him, scold him, insult him

32
00:00:59.166 --> 00:01:00.533
Are you human? Shut up

33
00:01:00.533 --> 00:01:02.033
You toad

34
00:01:02.133 --> 00:01:04.700
Didn't you hear what I just said?

35
00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:07.066
I'm Mrs. Takahashi now

36
00:01:07.066 --> 00:01:09.400
It's something you can't afford.

37
00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:10.866
Since you look down on us so much

38
00:01:10.866 --> 00:01:12.100
Then why did you come back?

39
00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:13.333
I came to Zhaojiacun

40
00:01:13.333 --> 00:01:15.766
One is to accompany my man to revisit the old place

41
00:01:15.866 --> 00:01:16.600
What about two?

42
00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.700
It is to sign a 1 billion contract with the richest man in Ma

43
00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.266
My son just won the Olympic championship.

44
00:01:22.266 --> 00:01:23.900
Not only did it win me glory

45
00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.433
And brought me a billion-dollar contract

46
00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.400
A billion dollars.

47
00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.966
Haven't you seen it?

48
00:01:31.133 --> 00:01:33.366
This is incredible wealth

49
00:01:33.366 --> 00:01:35.366
The old lady is a mother and a child are precious

50
00:01:35.366 --> 00:01:37.133
Why did you sign a 1 billion contract with a down payment?

51
00:01:37.133 --> 00:01:38.900
What are you doing in our ancestral hall?
