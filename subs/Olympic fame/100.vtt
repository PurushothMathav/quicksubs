00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:04.233
Although Zhao Ruolan is a woman

2
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.966
But women don't let men

3
00:00:06.966 --> 00:00:09.200
Not only did they win the Olympic championship

4
00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.333
Also hit the record in the play

5
00:00:12.333 --> 00:00:13.600
Congratulations

6
00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:17.266
Next, please ask Zhao Ruolan to give a speech

7
00:00:20.466 --> 00:00:23.366
Today is a good day for me.

8
00:00:23.366 --> 00:00:25.766
It is also a day that I will never forget for the rest of my life

9
00:00:25.766 --> 00:00:28.433
Because I won the Olympic championship.

10
00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.066
This champion doesn't just belong to me

11
00:00:34.066 --> 00:00:36.933
It also belongs to everyone who has helped me

12
00:00:36.933 --> 00:00:38.033
Without you

13
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.766
There would be no me, Zhao Ruolan, today

14
00:00:39.766 --> 00:00:41.100
The first one I want to thank

15
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.700
It's my dad's batch of parks

16
00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:44.533
They pay for their own meals.

17
00:00:44.533 --> 00:00:46.833
The money from selling the watch collected the entry book for me

18
00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:48.400
Here's 500 bucks.

19
00:00:48.466 --> 00:00:49.400
Give the child mercy

20
00:00:50.133 --> 00:00:51.400
This is my little thought

21
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.433
Take this this is mine this is mine

22
00:00:54.466 --> 00:00:56.200
And my good game

23
00:00:56.766 --> 00:00:57.566
Right?

24
00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.200
The second person to thank is the village chief uncle

25
00:01:01.366 --> 00:01:02.400
And uncle

26
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.000
They bullied me and scolded me.

27
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.366
But protect me when it's critical

28
00:01:07.366 --> 00:01:09.300
You have no one to clean you up, do you?

29
00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.133
Zhao Ruolai of the broken pheasant

30
00:01:11.133 --> 00:01:12.333
She's not your daughter anymore

31
00:01:12.333 --> 00:01:13.933
What right do you have to bully him?

32
00:01:13.933 --> 00:01:15.466
What right do you have to humiliate him?

33
00:01:15.466 --> 00:01:16.366
We bully him

34
00:01:16.366 --> 00:01:17.933
That's our own business in Zhaojiacun.

35
00:01:17.933 --> 00:01:20.700
What's the matter with you foreign-obsessed bitch?

36
00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.000
The last thing I want to thank is my dad

37
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
He gave me his best

38
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.100
He also taught me to strive for success

39
00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:30.400
To honor the ancestors

40
00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:31.700
To bring glory to the country

41
00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.266
Dad, I didn't let you down.

42
00:01:33.266 --> 00:01:34.100
And I did.

43
00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:35.833
I won the Olympic championship.

44
00:01:35.966 --> 00:01:37.133
Glory to you

45
00:01:37.133 --> 00:01:38.800
Glory to Zhaojiacun

46
00:01:38.866 --> 00:01:40.766
Glory to our country

47
00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.900
Dad used to be you who sheltered me from the wind and rain

48
00:01:48.933 --> 00:01:51.833
Now it's my turn to honor you

49
00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.300
I want you to be the happiest dad in the world
