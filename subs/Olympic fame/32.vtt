00:00:00.066 --> 00:00:05.100
The first dragon country Zhao Ruolan Ling hahahahahaha

2
00:00:05.466 --> 00:00:06.466
Oh my god

3
00:00:06.466 --> 00:00:07.600
You startled me.

4
00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:10.233
Oops, I really thought it would be a disaster

5
00:00:10.266 --> 00:00:11.966
Did you really win the world championship?

6
00:00:12.166 --> 00:00:14.566
It turns out that there are no grades at all

7
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:15.333
Calamity

8
00:00:15.333 --> 00:00:19.166
It must be that you were found engraved after the game

9
00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.666
So I'll give you 0 points.

10
00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:23.800
Now what are you arguing about?

11
00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.566
How is Zhang Dongfeng?

12
00:00:25.566 --> 00:00:28.900
I'm now saying that your ant sports school is a garbage dump

13
00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:30.166
Are you okay with it?

14
00:00:31.766 --> 00:00:32.733
How is that possible?

15
00:00:32.733 --> 00:00:33.933
Obviously there is no violation.

16
00:00:33.933 --> 00:00:35.400
How could my score be 0?

17
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.366
Yes, there must be something wrong here.

18
00:00:37.366 --> 00:00:39.700
If Zhao Ruolan's score is really 0

19
00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:40.600
So what's his name?

20
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.800
How can you rank first?

21
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:43.966
What's wrong with me?

22
00:00:43.966 --> 00:00:44.800
Our village

23
00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.766
Really broke the world record

24
00:00:46.766 --> 00:00:48.000
What happened to the donor?

25
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.833
Chief, I've heard of it

26
00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.700
If someone in the Olympic Games far exceeds the record

27
00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.266
Results will be delayed

28
00:00:54.266 --> 00:00:57.133
Wait until the president of the Olympic Committee has the evidence before announcing

29
00:00:57.133 --> 00:00:59.500
And that's going to dispel the audience.

30
00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.666
It can also dispel all negative public opinion

31
00:01:01.666 --> 00:01:03.133
Really?

32
00:01:03.133 --> 00:01:05.400
Our village has really produced an Olympic champion.
