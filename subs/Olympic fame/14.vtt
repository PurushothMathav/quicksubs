WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:02.566
Shut up we elders

2
00:00:02.566 --> 00:00:04.800
It's not your turn to call the bargain

3
00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.800
The reason why we didn't stand up in the first place

4
00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:08.200
Compete with Taro Takahashi

5
00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:10.100
Doesn't mean we're afraid of him

6
00:00:10.366 --> 00:00:12.466
We are too lazy to argue with this barbarian doctor

7
00:00:12.466 --> 00:00:13.766
He is a tourist

8
00:00:13.766 --> 00:00:15.366
Make a fuss and he's gone

9
00:00:15.366 --> 00:00:18.000
Who ever thought your father had to stand up and show off

10
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.833
I lost to Mrs. Takahashi

11
00:00:19.866 --> 00:00:21.200
Not only did he lose his face

12
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:24.400
It also made our Zhaojiacun ridiculed for ten years

13
00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.500
No courage is no courage

14
00:00:26.533 --> 00:00:28.766
You are less here, even if your father is not a disgrace

15
00:00:28.766 --> 00:00:32.500
What about you? The competition is a disgrace to the country by engraving things.

16
00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:33.900
Also kept by the rich

17
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:35.466
It's not scum. What is it?

18
00:00:35.466 --> 00:00:37.900
You said that the game engraved things were taken care of by the rich

19
00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:39.166
You show evidence?

20
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:40.666
Just lying to you?

21
00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:41.500
Zhou Ruolan

22
00:00:41.766 --> 00:00:43.700
You take a closer look at the news of your engraving

23
00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:44.666
Wearing newspapers

24
00:00:44.666 --> 00:00:46.166
What else do you have to quibble about?

25
00:00:46.166 --> 00:00:46.966
Zhao Ruolan

26
00:00:46.966 --> 00:00:49.066
If you can't give us a satisfactory explanation

27
00:00:49.066 --> 00:00:49.900
Then don't blame me

28
00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:51.133
I will expel you from this village immediately

29
00:00:51.133 --> 00:00:53.366
What else does the village chief use to explain?

30
00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.600
The motorcade outside is the best evidence

31
00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:56.966
If he is not taken care of

32
00:00:56.966 --> 00:00:58.900
How did the convoy outside come about?

33
00:01:00.866 --> 00:01:02.000
Go faster.

34
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.800
I'm so eager to see this world record breaker

35
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.466
An Olympic champion who has pushed the limits of human beings
