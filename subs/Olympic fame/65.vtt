00:00:00.866 --> 00:00:03.466
Ah, of course I know.

2
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.300
You're just looking at my son

3
00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:07.100
Just won the Olympic championship

4
00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:09.600
Just gave me the contract and three generous gifts?

5
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:11.800
I also know that Ma Shoufu

6
00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.533
You will be with the best every year

7
00:00:14.533 --> 00:00:19.066
The most dazzling world champion signs a spokesperson contract

8
00:00:19.166 --> 00:00:19.966
Ah!

9
00:00:20.333 --> 00:00:23.166
Ma Shoufu, take out the contract

10
00:00:23.166 --> 00:00:24.533
You are so sincere

11
00:00:24.533 --> 00:00:27.566
I have convinced my son to work with you

12
00:00:27.566 --> 00:00:30.366
Hahaha sign the contract

13
00:00:30.733 --> 00:00:31.533
Right

14
00:00:32.066 --> 00:00:33.966
Contract Secretary

15
00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.066
Yes, bring us our contract

16
00:00:47.533 --> 00:00:48.666
Did you see it?

17
00:00:48.666 --> 00:00:49.833
lose money

18
00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.833
My son can bring me a billion dollar contract

19
00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:57.666
And you can sign a spokesperson agreement with Ma Shoufu

20
00:00:57.866 --> 00:01:00.566
And what are you?

21
00:01:00.933 --> 00:01:03.066
You are nothing but my shame

22
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.666
Stay in Zhaojiacun for the rest of your life

23
00:01:05.666 --> 00:01:07.833
Find a local dog to marry casually

24
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.866
Spend a lifetime doing nothing

25
00:01:09.866 --> 00:01:11.566
Hahaha mom

26
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.700
How can you say that to people?

27
00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.066
Isn't Zhao Ruolan being taken care of by a rich man?

28
00:01:16.066 --> 00:01:17.933
He can at least sell it

29
00:01:17.933 --> 00:01:19.700
Can you sell it for a lot of money?

30
00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:20.600
Sun Meifeng

31
00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.500
How could you be so mean to your own daughter?

32
00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:25.266
You're not even human.

33
00:01:25.266 --> 00:01:26.466
You shut up

34
00:01:26.533 --> 00:01:28.033
You old thing

35
00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:30.766
Didn't you hear what I just said?

36
00:01:30.766 --> 00:01:32.800
He doesn't deserve to be my daughter at all

37
00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.566
I'll give you one last chance.

38
00:01:36.333 --> 00:01:40.166
You really don't recognize Zhao Ruolan as a daughter?

39
00:01:40.766 --> 00:01:43.633
Are you sure you want to distance yourself from him?

40
00:01:43.666 --> 00:01:45.466
That's right, the richest man in Ma

41
00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.300
Who loves who wants

42
00:01:47.366 --> 00:01:49.000
I don't want it anyway

43
00:01:49.066 --> 00:01:51.600
Good, very good.
