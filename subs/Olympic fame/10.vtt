00:00:00.466 --> 00:00:01.266
Stop

2
00:00:08.866 --> 00:00:11.766
Daughter dad sorry for you

3
00:00:12.366 --> 00:00:14.200
Dad is useless

4
00:00:14.566 --> 00:00:17.833
Dad couldn't save his last estate

5
00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.866
Dad, it's okay, you've done a great job

6
00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.966
Uncle, my father is your relative after all

7
00:00:28.966 --> 00:00:31.766
How can you force him to death?

8
00:00:31.766 --> 00:00:34.300
Dad works for you, and it doesn't count if you don't pay

9
00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:35.666
And you humiliated him?

10
00:00:36.133 --> 00:00:37.966
I still want to eat his unique skills

11
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.533
You're worse than animals.

12
00:00:39.533 --> 00:00:41.566
Shut up, bargain

13
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.400
You can see that.

14
00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.900
It was your father who had to lift this decade by himself

15
00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:48.833
No one forced him.

16
00:00:48.866 --> 00:00:52.100
It is our ancestors who are martial arts

17
00:00:52.866 --> 00:00:54.700
Your father lost to the Fuso people

18
00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:56.066
Lost the face of our ancestors

19
00:00:56.066 --> 00:00:57.500
Lost our face in Zhaojiacun

20
00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.700
If he can't lift this decade today

21
00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.766
He is not qualified to offer incense to his ancestors

22
00:01:02.766 --> 00:01:04.666
He is not from our Zhaojiacun

23
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.100
Since he is not

24
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.400
Everything about him leaves the palace

25
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.333
No no no

26
00:01:09.333 --> 00:01:10.566
Don't be reluctant

27
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.366
Chief, I beg you

28
00:01:12.366 --> 00:01:15.366
That was the last inheritance I left to the Tathagata

29
00:01:15.366 --> 00:01:16.366
second uncle

30
00:01:16.966 --> 00:01:18.100
Then you are in a hurry

31
00:01:19.566 --> 00:01:21.566
Can you?

32
00:01:21.766 --> 00:01:24.166
Isn't it just a 300kg 10 years?

33
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.000
I'll just go for my dad
