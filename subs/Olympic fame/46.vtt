00:00:02.366 --> 00:00:04.400
Isn't it just bullying my husband's age?

2
00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:05.733
What's there to be arrogant about?

3
00:00:05.733 --> 00:00:07.333
I still want my husband to give this fool

4
00:00:07.333 --> 00:00:08.066
Waste and bargains

5
00:00:08.066 --> 00:00:08.700
apologize

6
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.533
No way they don't deserve me

7
00:00:10.533 --> 00:00:13.066
It just so happens that Taro is of noble blood

8
00:00:13.166 --> 00:00:13.966
Fuso people

9
00:00:13.966 --> 00:00:17.400
He Zhao Mi is just a mud leg in the countryside

10
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.700
It's impossible for me to apologize to him

11
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:21.400
But

12
00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.200
I, Taro Takahashi, am not a man of unbelief

13
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:25.233
So be it.

14
00:00:27.366 --> 00:00:30.866
I'll give you 100 bucks and it's over

15
00:00:30.866 --> 00:00:32.866
What do you mean by taking the 100 yuan?

16
00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:35.700
Is my father's personality and dignity worth 100?

17
00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.333
Why is it too little?

18
00:00:37.333 --> 00:00:39.766
Then I'll give you 1,000 yuan.

19
00:00:39.766 --> 00:00:41.700
It's not about the money at all.

20
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.166
You bargain

21
00:00:43.166 --> 00:00:45.700
I want to sit on the ground with your useless dad

22
00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:46.500
Right?

23
00:00:47.366 --> 00:00:49.800
Here 10,000 dollars. You take it

24
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.100
Enough for you women for half a year

25
00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.800
Stop biting my wife

26
00:00:55.733 --> 00:00:58.600
Husband, don't be angry

27
00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.166
They just want money, these hillbillies

28
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.133
10,000 bucks is enough for them

29
00:01:03.133 --> 00:01:04.366
Don't be angry.

30
00:01:05.933 --> 00:01:06.866
I don't want money.

31
00:01:06.866 --> 00:01:08.600
I just need your apology.
