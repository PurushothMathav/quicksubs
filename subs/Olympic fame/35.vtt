1
00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:01.100
What's the situation?

2
00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:03.000
Does Zhao Ruolan really have achievements?

3
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.333
It shouldn't be.

4
00:00:04.333 --> 00:00:06.466
I'm clean, why can't I get results?

5
00:00:06.466 --> 00:00:08.566
I'll know when the results come out in a while.

6
00:00:08.566 --> 00:00:10.000
I lied

7
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.500
Or is Zhang Wanglong lying?

8
00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:13.933
Today I will not only prove my innocence

9
00:00:13.933 --> 00:00:16.400
And get justice for my dad

10
00:00:17.533 --> 00:00:20.566
Chairperson, since Zhao Ruolan's results are out

11
00:00:20.566 --> 00:00:22.500
Why not announce it as soon as possible?

12
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.333
I just published his ranking.

13
00:00:24.333 --> 00:00:27.466
He not only broke the Olympic record this time

14
00:00:27.466 --> 00:00:29.600
Historical records before the Yuan Dynasty

15
00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.066
Just think about it.

16
00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:33.133
Zhao Ruolan, a young girl

17
00:00:33.133 --> 00:00:35.500
To achieve such incredible results

18
00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.100
What happens if it's made public?

19
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.200
The whole world will definitely question it

20
00:00:42.333 --> 00:00:43.600
Under public opinion

21
00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.500
It is likely to destroy Zhao Ruolan, a good seedling

22
00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:48.366
Nice

23
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.566
So we must get to Zhaojiacun as soon as possible

24
00:00:52.566 --> 00:00:55.300
Take out evidence to protect Zhao Ruolan as soon as possible

25
00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:56.800
Hold up for Zhao Ruolan
