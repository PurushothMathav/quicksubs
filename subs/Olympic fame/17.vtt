1
00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:01.366
What's going on here?

2
00:00:01.466 --> 00:00:03.666
Zhao Ruolan actually won the weightlifting championship

3
00:00:03.766 --> 00:00:06.466
Could it be that Zhao Ruolan really didn't engrave anything?

4
00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:07.866
It's not maintained.

5
00:00:07.866 --> 00:00:09.900
Then what Zhao Ruolan said is true

6
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:12.066
Everyone make way

7
00:00:12.066 --> 00:00:13.366
Let it go

8
00:00:13.366 --> 00:00:14.400
Zhao Ruolan

9
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:15.766
Congratulations, congratulations.

10
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.700
He broke the weightlifting record

11
00:00:17.766 --> 00:00:19.733
You're the champion.

12
00:00:19.733 --> 00:00:21.000
This 30,000 dollars

13
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.500
It's my ant sports school's reward for you.

14
00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:24.366
That's impossible.

15
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.333
How could Zhao Ruolan break the record?

16
00:00:27.333 --> 00:00:29.200
How could Zhao Ruolan win the championship?

17
00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.100
This Olympic Games is due to a player violating the rules

18
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:33.100
Eat indiscriminately

19
00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.033
That's why the results were delayed.

20
00:00:36.266 --> 00:00:38.700
The results will not be announced until after 12 o'clock

21
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.133
There are still 3 minutes left.

22
00:00:40.133 --> 00:00:42.866
How could you possibly know that Zhao Ruolan won the championship?

23
00:00:43.566 --> 00:00:44.600
I had a teacher.

24
00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.866
He knew the people on the national team and he told me

25
00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.533
Zhao Ruolan Yiming is amazing

26
00:00:50.533 --> 00:00:52.333
Broke this weightlifting record

27
00:00:52.333 --> 00:00:54.566
You think this record can be broken?

28
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.966
Does that show?

29
00:00:55.966 --> 00:00:59.066
This championship is not a well-deserved thing.

30
00:00:59.066 --> 00:01:01.000
Oh, really.
