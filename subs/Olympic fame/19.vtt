1
00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:01.500
Don't be bloody

2
00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:04.800
You can say my ant sports school but the facilities don't work

3
00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:07.466
Then can't you call my students trash?

4
00:00:07.466 --> 00:00:10.000
They may not have a chance

5
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.566
But once given the opportunity

6
00:00:11.566 --> 00:00:13.466
Is that just like Zhao Ruolan?

7
00:00:13.466 --> 00:00:14.666
You can win the championship

8
00:00:14.666 --> 00:00:15.866
To break the record?

9
00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:18.866
Okay, don't say those unnutritious words

10
00:00:18.866 --> 00:00:20.333
I'll just ask you one question

11
00:00:20.333 --> 00:00:21.500
This decade

12
00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.000
Your ant sports school

13
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.400
Have you ever been in the top ten Olympic athletes?

14
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:26.433
Nope.

15
00:00:26.666 --> 00:00:30.333
But not before does not mean not now and in the future

16
00:00:30.333 --> 00:00:32.166
It doesn't mean Zhao Ruolan

17
00:00:32.266 --> 00:00:33.666
He can't win the championship

18
00:00:33.666 --> 00:00:37.100
If you have the ability to speak with your grades, who wouldn't

19
00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:38.666
You you what you

20
00:00:38.666 --> 00:00:39.900
To recruit students

21
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.233
A junk can be called a champion

22
00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:45.033
It's bottomless

23
00:00:45.266 --> 00:00:48.200
Birds of a feather flock together.

24
00:00:48.466 --> 00:00:50.266
Don't you just want grades?

25
00:00:50.266 --> 00:00:52.266
And I'm going to prove it to you right now.

26
00:00:52.333 --> 00:00:53.800
How do you want to prove it?

27
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.433
If I can pick up this 400kg in 10 years

28
00:00:57.566 --> 00:00:59.633
Will it prove my innocence?

29
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:02.866
It can also prove that I can win the Olympic championship
