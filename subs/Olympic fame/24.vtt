1
00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:01.733
Unattainable existence

2
00:00:01.733 --> 00:00:02.900
You are the third runner-up

3
00:00:03.133 --> 00:00:04.766
What right do you have to say such a thing?

4
00:00:04.766 --> 00:00:07.200
I may not have this qualification for others

5
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.366
But I'm a bargain for you

6
00:00:09.666 --> 00:00:11.966
I am qualified

7
00:00:12.166 --> 00:00:14.266
I am the pride of Zhaojiacun

8
00:00:14.566 --> 00:00:16.233
I am the third runner-up in the Olympic Games

9
00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:18.966
What about you? What are you?

10
00:00:19.133 --> 00:00:21.433
You are a waste of carving

11
00:00:21.666 --> 00:00:23.466
It was taken care of by someone else

12
00:00:23.533 --> 00:00:25.666
Is a liar with integrity

13
00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:27.600
Don't tell me to give you a lifetime

14
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.733
I'll give you ten lifetimes.

15
00:00:29.733 --> 00:00:32.733
I am also the existence you need to look up to forever

16
00:00:32.733 --> 00:00:34.000
What are you so proud of?

17
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.733
My scene will come out in a while

18
00:00:35.733 --> 00:00:38.900
My ranking will definitely be higher than yours

19
00:00:39.266 --> 00:00:40.166
Zhao Ruolan

20
00:00:40.866 --> 00:00:43.333
You know what you're saying?

21
00:00:43.333 --> 00:00:46.200
My son is an Olympian

22
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.866
You said you were closer than him

23
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:49.966
You are the runner-up

24
00:00:49.966 --> 00:00:51.666
Is it the champion?

25
00:00:51.666 --> 00:00:53.366
Principal Zhang said you are the champion

26
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.800
Do you really think you are the number one in the world?

27
00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:56.966
Principal Zhang

28
00:00:57.133 --> 00:01:00.666
Look at what you've done to this kid

29
00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:01.933
What are you talking about?

30
00:01:01.933 --> 00:01:04.400
When the official results are announced later

31
00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.300
Don't get slapped in the face then.
