00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:01.466
You bargain

2
00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:03.500
What qualifications do you have to compare with my son?

3
00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:06.766
My son is an Olympic champion.

4
00:00:06.933 --> 00:00:08.800
And noble blood

5
00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:12.666
And you're just a hillbilly woman

6
00:00:12.666 --> 00:00:14.400
What do you compare to my son?

7
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.466
You are countless compared to my son alone

8
00:00:17.466 --> 00:00:19.966
My son, what do you want?

9
00:00:20.133 --> 00:00:22.000
What do I want?

10
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.700
Since it is a comparison

11
00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:28.166
Of course you have to add some lottery

12
00:00:28.266 --> 00:00:29.866
If you lose

13
00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:31.766
You take off that plaque

14
00:00:32.533 --> 00:00:34.533
Kneeling in front of my son

15
00:00:34.533 --> 00:00:35.866
Why bother to admit your mistake

16
00:00:35.866 --> 00:00:38.500
And admit that you Zhaojiacun are all garbage

17
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.666
How about Sun didn't let it go?

18
00:00:41.133 --> 00:00:42.933
You are also a building person

19
00:00:42.933 --> 00:00:44.166
How can you say that?

20
00:00:44.166 --> 00:00:45.066
shut up

21
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.166
Since the Mid-Autumn Festival ten years ago

22
00:00:48.166 --> 00:00:50.566
I'm no longer a building man

23
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.866
It was Prince Takahashi

24
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.433
Is a Fuso

25
00:00:54.966 --> 00:00:57.600
I'm not from the same world as you.

26
00:00:57.733 --> 00:00:59.800
You are trash, trash

27
00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.566
And I'm the mother of an Olympic champion.

28
00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:06.166
Stop talking nonsense

29
00:01:06.333 --> 00:01:08.666
Just say dare to gamble

30
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.566
What if I win?
