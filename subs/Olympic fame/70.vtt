1
00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.966
Death doesn't believe what he says

2
00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.666
I, Ma Jinshan, kept my promise

3
00:00:04.666 --> 00:00:07.033
If you say you are banned, you will definitely be banned.

4
00:00:07.066 --> 00:00:08.200
Ma Shoufu

5
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:11.000
What benefit did Zhao Ruolan give you?

6
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.433
Let you offend us at all costs

7
00:00:13.666 --> 00:00:16.166
Offend you also deserve these two words

8
00:00:16.866 --> 00:00:19.466
I'm just cleaning up for Zhao Luonan

9
00:00:19.533 --> 00:00:21.266
Recalcitrant scum

10
00:00:21.566 --> 00:00:23.666
Ma Shoufu said it well

11
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.700
Sun Meifeng is not only a slut who abandons her husband and daughter

12
00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:30.666
Or help little Japan bully our defeated beauty

13
00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:32.433
Should clean up

14
00:00:32.566 --> 00:00:35.100
Also delusional to smash the plaque of our champion

15
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.233
Are you disgusting?

16
00:00:44.266 --> 00:00:46.800
Ma Zongma is the richest man

17
00:00:46.966 --> 00:00:48.166
It's all our fault

18
00:00:48.166 --> 00:00:49.500
We apologize to you.

19
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.600
Can you just give us another chance?

20
00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:59.700
Ruolan, my good daughter

21
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:00.900
I'm mom

22
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.166
Quickly help your mother and Ma Shoufu to beg for mercy

23
00:01:03.166 --> 00:01:06.166
Don't block us!

24
00:01:06.666 --> 00:01:08.500
Haven't you cut ties with me?

25
00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:09.166
how

26
00:01:09.166 --> 00:01:11.000
Now what are you asking me for this bargain?

27
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.700
That is, you are advanced people

28
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.433
Of noble blood

29
00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.033
Look at Zhao Ruolan, such a bargain

30
00:01:19.566 --> 00:01:21.166
Don't feel ashamed

31
00:01:21.166 --> 00:01:24.666
Zhao Ruolan, I order you to ask for our kiss immediately

32
00:01:24.733 --> 00:01:26.700
Otherwise, don't blame me for turning my back

33
00:01:26.766 --> 00:01:29.433
OK, then you kneel now

34
00:01:29.466 --> 00:01:33.200
Apologize to my dad and the people in Zhaojiacun

35
00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:34.600
That's not possible.

36
00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:36.366
Then there's nothing more to say

37
00:01:36.533 --> 00:01:38.800
Good Zhao Ruolan

38
00:01:39.066 --> 00:01:40.800
Since you are so heartless

39
00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:42.666
Then don't blame me for being rude.
