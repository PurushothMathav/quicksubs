00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.666
Who says I can't kill an Olympic champion?

2
00:00:01.666 --> 00:00:03.400
I just had to prove myself

3
00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:04.766
Did you give me a chance?

4
00:00:04.766 --> 00:00:06.333
I've made it through 10 years

5
00:00:06.333 --> 00:00:08.333
Why don't you want to give me the last 3 seconds?

6
00:00:08.333 --> 00:00:09.100
Why is that?

7
00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:12.166
An Olympic champion means money to you

8
00:00:12.166 --> 00:00:13.900
Honor

9
00:00:13.933 --> 00:00:16.300
But to me, he's got my dad's head up.

10
00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:18.066
Can make the whole Zhaojiacun raise its head

11
00:00:18.066 --> 00:00:19.566
Can bring you back

12
00:00:19.566 --> 00:00:21.366
Takahashi can bring you

13
00:00:21.366 --> 00:00:22.733
I can still

14
00:00:22.733 --> 00:00:25.166
But now you don't deserve it.

15
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.100
What can you bring me as a loser?

16
00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:30.200
What money honor

17
00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:31.066
Apprentice

18
00:00:31.066 --> 00:00:33.566
I bah, do you have that much ability?

19
00:00:33.566 --> 00:00:36.233
You'll just be like your useless dad

20
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.066
Yongxuan can't raise his head to be a man

21
00:00:38.066 --> 00:00:38.866
Sold you

22
00:00:38.866 --> 00:00:41.866
Than half of what my son can bring me

23
00:00:41.866 --> 00:00:43.166
That's not necessarily true.

24
00:00:43.166 --> 00:00:45.533
They sold it to horse selectors

25
00:00:45.533 --> 00:00:47.133
Maybe

26
00:00:47.133 --> 00:00:47.900
Here it is.

27
00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:49.900
It's the car of IOC President Jax

28
00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:51.066
He really came
