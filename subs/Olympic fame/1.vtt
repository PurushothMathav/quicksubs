1
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:10.100
And so forth.

2
00:00:10.766 --> 00:00:11.966
Add another bag to him.

3
00:00:12.466 --> 00:00:14.366
Boss, two bags are already enough.

4
00:00:14.366 --> 00:00:17.766
Daming hurt his lumbar spine with contempt from Takahashi Taro before

5
00:00:17.766 --> 00:00:19.733
Can't carry too much hum

6
00:00:19.733 --> 00:00:21.733
It is because he lost to the Japanese pirates

7
00:00:21.733 --> 00:00:23.433
They humiliated us.

8
00:00:23.466 --> 00:00:24.266
add

9
00:00:24.866 --> 00:00:26.166
Come and click

10
00:00:37.966 --> 00:00:39.766
Daming, Daming, don't help him

11
00:00:40.133 --> 00:00:41.000
Go to work

12
00:00:41.533 --> 00:00:42.333
Bah

13
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.833
I lost to Xiaotian when I couldn't afford the top spot

14
00:00:45.866 --> 00:00:47.333
Lost the face of our ancestors

15
00:00:47.333 --> 00:00:49.466
The wife was also robbed by Xiaodi

16
00:00:49.466 --> 00:00:51.600
Can't even carry a few bags of feed now?

17
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.266
Hmph, don't tell anyone when you go out in the future

18
00:00:54.266 --> 00:00:55.900
You are my stinky brother

19
00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:56.800
Can you still move

20
00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:57.700
Move as soon as you can

21
00:00:57.766 --> 00:01:00.133
Can't move back to your poor dog

22
00:01:00.133 --> 00:01:02.000
I don't raise idlers

23
00:01:03.533 --> 00:01:04.433
Big brother and sister-in-law

24
00:01:04.566 --> 00:01:07.900
I can do it. My daughter has been training a lot recently.

25
00:01:07.966 --> 00:01:10.066
I'm going to buy some nutritional supplements for her.

26
00:01:11.133 --> 00:01:15.133
Dad, I can go to the Olympic Games, Dad

27
00:01:15.133 --> 00:01:15.766
Principal Zhang

28
00:01:15.766 --> 00:01:17.866
Got me a place in the Olympic qualifiers

29
00:01:18.533 --> 00:01:21.033
But you have to go to the temperature stadium to play at your own expense

30
00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:22.200
But I am confident

31
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.400
As long as I can compete

32
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.866
I will definitely make it to the finals

33
00:01:24.933 --> 00:01:26.600
Maybe come back with an Olympic champion

34
00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.100
Ok my good daughter

35
00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.833
You finally have something

36
00:01:31.066 --> 00:01:31.866
That's right.

37
00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.200
How much is your fare?

38
00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:35.300
Dad will give you

39
00:01:35.533 --> 00:01:37.833
About 5,000.

40
00:01:38.133 --> 00:01:40.300
But I've saved up 2,000 scholarships

41
00:01:40.733 --> 00:01:42.500
3,000 more

42
00:01:43.333 --> 00:01:44.200
OK

43
00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:52.766
Not enough?
