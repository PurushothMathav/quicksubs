00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:02.720
Dad, I bought that land back.

2
00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:05.200
Including the Joe family's land, how much did it cost?

3
00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:06.620
A little too much.

4
00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:07.660
Two billion.

5
00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:10.620
It's doubled over there.

6
00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:13.980
Two billion is not much.

7
00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.900
I'm curious that Qin Yuming, he's not stupid.

8
00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:18.960
Why did you sell this land to me?

9
00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.100
The current manager of Qin Shi Group is that idiot Qin Fengming.

10
00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:23.860
I'm just using tricks.

11
00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.100
He's going to sell me the land.

12
00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:27.660
Qin Yuming is an old man.

13
00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:29.420
Fired a fool for power.

14
00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:31.160
They can't do it.

15
00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:32.340
The paradox is difficult.

16
00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:35.360
Dad, that land's bought back now.

17
00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:36.780
What to do next?

18
00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:38.660
If you develop that land

19
00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:40.600
But it takes a lot of money.

20
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.100
Okay, this one needs some stock.

21
00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:44.700
Start-up Fundraising

22
00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:46.980
It's still easy.

23
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.020
If you want to take stock.

24
00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:52.220
It is better to sell some companies that have no value.

25
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.320
Yeah, who did you sell it to?

26
00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:55.820
You Qin idiot.

27
00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.780
I have a way for him to buy it.

28
00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.020
Okay, then leave this to you.

29
00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:05.520
Thanks, I'll be right there.

30
00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:06.740
I'll come with you.
