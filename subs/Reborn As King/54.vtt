1
00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:01.460
It's impossible.

2
00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:05.940
Second Young Master, if you don't believe me, you can check it online.

3
00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.420
Now the whole network is talking about this game.

4
00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:11.020
It is equal to the glory of the king.

5
00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:13.900
Tell me.

6
00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:15.340
Vu Feng hasn't said yet.

7
00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:20.020
Your bet requires you to make 1.5 billion dollars in a month.

8
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.340
Now just to prove that your game is exploding.

9
00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.960
It doesn't mean you can make 1.5 billion dollars back in a month.

10
00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.540
It's just construction.

11
00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:31.840
It's not pure profit.

12
00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:33.060
You may not win.

13
00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.580
Sage, in its current form.

14
00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.680
Can the profit reach 1.5 billion within a month?

15
00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.740
Master doesn't need a month.

16
00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:43.900
Just now.

17
00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.240
General Manager Joe sold the dealer rights to this game to a large client.

18
00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:50.420
The price is 20 pieces.

19
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.500
I heard they only made two billion.

20
00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:59.140
What else do you say, you idiot?
