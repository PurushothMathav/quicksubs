00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:02.920
Let's make you proud for a while.

2
00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:04.740
After that game exploded.

3
00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:07.700
See how you still laugh.

4
00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:11.180
Master has exploded.

5
00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:13.540
What exploded?

6
00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:17.220
Make sure to tell the company of the game you just bought.

7
00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.380
Qin Fengming, I'm telling you.

8
00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.280
This kind of constantly losing company is a hole.

9
00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:24.860
You're the only fool who'll spend $1.5 billion on it.

10
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.040
Of course, I'm not saying you're stupid.

11
00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:30.460
After all, you're fascinated by the beauty of Li's poetry.

12
00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.960
What the hell are you talking about?

13
00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:37.760
You.

14
00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.200
Don't be excessive.

15
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.980
The first bet was that you'd fight me.

16
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.220
Now that you've lost, vent your anger on people.

17
00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:46.340
You talk a lot.

18
00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.260
That's enough.

19
00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:52.920
Tell me, did something happen to the game company that Fengming just bought?

20
00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.660
What's going on?

21
00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.460
Today the game company has released a new game.

22
00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.560
Just an hour online, the water's already broken by the billions.

23
00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:03.120
This game is absolutely explosive.

24
00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.020
Sir, this is a great pleasure.

25
00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:06.380
Ah.
