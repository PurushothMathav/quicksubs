1
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.180
Now you've won.

2
00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:07.500
This check can be returned.

3
00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:13.680
Tiger, I did win, but White City owes you a lot of money.

4
00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:17.340
So this check will compensate you on his behalf.

5
00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:19.400
That's enough.

6
00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.660
This friend of mine has made friends.

7
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.360
If anything happens, come find me.

8
00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:28.500
Thank you.

9
00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.000
Bach Xiao Wei is the woman you see.

10
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.700
Really let her go like that.

11
00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.980
Remember, Qin Feng Ming is my brother.

12
00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.260
If you are my wife, you are my sister-in-law.

13
00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:48.300
Who dares mention this anymore?

14
00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.060
Who am I going to kill?

15
00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.060
I know, Tiger.

16
00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.020
A billion.

17
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.580
Give it away.

18
00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.020
Is it stupid or...

19
00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.100
Qin Shao Tiger just said he wants to forgive my gambling debt.

20
00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.420
Why do you still leave a billion checks?

21
00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.540
If a billion checks don't leave.

22
00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.460
We're afraid we can't get out of here.

23
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.460
They all say that Master Qin is a fool.

24
00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:22.780
Now it seems

25
00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.800
This is obviously a stupid mind.

26
00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.880
Miss Bai, I have saved you.

27
00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:30.340
Should our deal be done?
