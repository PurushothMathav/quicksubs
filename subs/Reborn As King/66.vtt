00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:02.680
Oh, I knew it would be like this.

2
00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:04.440
People are superstars.

3
00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:06.840
How can I agree to such a request?

4
00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:09.860
Miss White, don't be angry.

5
00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.420
I can, I can't be a host.

6
00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:14.940
Save Dao to see off guests

7
00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:19.260
I mean, I can help you save your brother.

8
00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:21.980
What do you mean?

9
00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.660
I heard your brother's in gambling debt.

10
00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:27.440
We're under arrest.

11
00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:28.660
But here's the thing.

12
00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.140
Bach Xiaowi's younger brother is in gambling debt.

13
00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:32.500
How is that possible?

14
00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:34.420
The entertainment world has no news.

15
00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:35.980
How do you know?

16
00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:38.480
News from a previous life, of course.

17
00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:40.660
It's just that this news hasn't been revealed yet.

18
00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:44.460
Don't care how I know.

19
00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:48.040
The important thing is that I can help you save your brother.

20
00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:51.180
The condition is that you come to my company as a soldier.

21
00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:52.520
Okay.

22
00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.140
If you can save my brother.

23
00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:57.920
Whatever you want me to do.

24
00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.820
This is the superstar of entertainment.

25
00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:03.400
Promise to do anything now.

26
00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:05.980
Doesn't that mean I can?
