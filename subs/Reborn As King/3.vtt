00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:06.940
Forget it, this ring is too heavy and will hurt you. Thank you, Master, hammer face, etc.

2
00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.740
I didn't say I'll forgive you.

3
00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:12.280
Shut up.

4
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:17.140
Um, he's my brother in this life.

5
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.440
Ok, let's see how I clean up your brother.

6
00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:22.260
This is your favorite crystal milk bottle.

7
00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.220
I traded him for this woman.

8
00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:28.040
A fool is a fool.

9
00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:30.120
A crystal with a job.

10
00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:31.180
This little secretary.

11
00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:32.700
I will put

12
00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:34.580
Fuck you.

13
00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:38.780
A broken crystal milk jug wants to change my secretary

14
00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.280
You look like a fool

15
00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.020
Aren't you a fool

16
00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.220
At least you get a yellow brick.

17
00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.560
Ok, I'll go onstage and send it to you later.

18
00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:51.160
What do you want to do later?

19
00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.420
Won't he buy it himself?

20
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.640
Go you still carry me

21
00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.160
You told me to carry you. Can't you just stand there and look for my father?

22
00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:01.540
This aspect is crazy.

23
00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:07.140
It's useless to call your father. I'll call you. I'll call you. I'll call my father.
