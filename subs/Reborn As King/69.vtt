00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:01.280
What?

2
00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:04.040
South Korea can win.

3
00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:06.720
Hahahaha, he said South Korea can win.

4
00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.280
Ha ha ha ha ha

5
00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.440
Monster, you want to save me?

6
00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:13.740
How can South Korea win?

7
00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:16.760
Aren't you not giving me silver flowers?

8
00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:21.600
Haha, that's it, haha, I don't just feel that the Korean team can win.

9
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.160
And I even think South Korea can score two goals.

10
00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.800
You can score two goals.

11
00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.280
He said he could score two goals.

12
00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:31.680
Hey, okay.

13
00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:33.960
If South Korea can score two goals

14
00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.580
I immediately released him.

15
00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.360
And the money he owes me doesn't need to be paid.

16
00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:40.500
Hahaha, Daji Tiger

17
00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.920
But if you lose...

18
00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.920
Don't blame me for stealing your Qin family's property.

19
00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.100
Tiger, don't worry.

20
00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.680
I'm always willing to bet.

21
00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.500
It's fun, even if you lose.

22
00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.740
My friend's friend also delivered it.

23
00:00:58.600 --> 00:00:59.400
Hey.

24
00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:06.120
I don't understand the ball.

25
00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:08.000
But I also know Germany is a strong team.

26
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.400
South Korea is not even second class.

27
00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:10.740
How to win against Germany?

28
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.920
You are impulsive this time, don't worry.

29
00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.760
I said if South Korea can win, it can win.

30
00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:18.660
Why is Master Qin so confident?

31
00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.300
How is that possible?
