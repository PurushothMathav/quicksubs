00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:03.600
Young master, aren t we here to ask for a dowry?

2
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.060
There is no dowry now.

3
00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:06.740
Instead, it spent a billion dollars.

4
00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:08.720
Mortgage company.

5
00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:10.300
How to tell grandpa?

6
00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:11.360
Say what?

7
00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:14.300
I am the great young master of the Qin dynasty.

8
00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:15.760
What's wrong with buying land?

9
00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:18.160
Get some cows to come in.

10
00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.020
It's a wasteland.

11
00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:22.260
And the price is too high.

12
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.540
You also feel stupid.

13
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:25.520
No.

14
00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:27.560
That's all I am.

15
00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.740
If only the milk tank had been built on that land.

16
00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.720
I'm naming you the milk bottle manager.

17
00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:36.500
The milk in the house belongs to your management.

18
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:42.260
Of course, I think that the soil of that milk tank will definitely be of higher value.

19
00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:44.400
If not born

20
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:45.980
I'll give you 10 million.

21
00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.260
10 million real

22
00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:50.240
It's natural.

23
00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:54.260
But you're the big milk bottle manager first.

24
00:00:58.640 --> 00:00:59.700
Come back.

25
00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.640
Master, you know that you bought the land.

26
00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.580
I want you back there.

27
00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:07.820
Then go ahead.

28
00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:13.920
Dad, I'm back. I'm looking for a job.

29
00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.060
The company's equity has been mortgaged.

30
00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:17.980
Right.

31
00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.640
For a woman.

32
00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.600
Did you mortgage the company?

33
00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.220
Are you trying to make me angry?
