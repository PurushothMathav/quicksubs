00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.400
Is this idiot crazy to want milk?

2
00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:04.240
But just rely on you being an idiot.

3
00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:06.660
To earn 300 million is impossible.

4
00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:09.420
What if you don't make 300 million?

5
00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:12.280
If I don't make 300 million.

6
00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:15.360
I didn't ask about the company.

7
00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.360
Hey, friend, can you hear me?

8
00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:19.000
Yeah, he said that.

9
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.900
Never ask about the company again.

10
00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:25.500
It is better to really know that Fengming has a problem with his mind, but it is also Fengming's habit.

11
00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:26.680
But that's okay.

12
00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:28.040
Break the mind of Phoenix

13
00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:29.620
Let him rest assured.

14
00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:33.100
Phoenix, are you sure you didn't make 300 million?

15
00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:34.820
No company management.

16
00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:37.640
Dad, I'm sure.

17
00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:43.020
But the reward my mother promised me, you can't stop it.

18
00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:44.300
I didn't stop you.

19
00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.560
Phoenix, what about the money you earn?

20
00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:48.660
Take it out and show us.

21
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:51.740
For my brother.

22
00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.660
Dad.

23
00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.740
Here's the three billion I made.

24
00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:57.980
Look.

25
00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.240
Take a tattered piece of paper and say he's made 300 million dollars.

26
00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:03.840
Brother, your old problem has been committed again.

27
00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.220
If you force this, I will beat you to death.

28
00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.460
Well, this check.

29
00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:14.740
You can exchange 3 billion at any time.

30
00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.740
Impossible, ha, ha, ha, ha.

31
00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:19.100
That's the truth.
