1
00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:02.340
That's enough.

2
00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:03.980
You're right.

3
00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:06.100
You bought this land.

4
00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:08.740
What you want to do with it is really your business.

5
00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.080
But this is an opportunity to grow the company.

6
00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:12.720
You left your opponent in vain.

7
00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:15.480
This ability has no way of managing the company.

8
00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.920
Well, the president's just for you.

9
00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:19.900
It's basically unqualified.

10
00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:21.300
What do you think?

11
00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.440
The young lady and the young lady make sense.

12
00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:27.540
You can do things like that.

13
00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:29.620
I feel this CEO position.

14
00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:31.680
You're not a good fit either.

15
00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:33.980
Agree, agree.

16
00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:37.840
I'd like to share that billion dollars with everyone.

17
00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.340
So if people don't support me as CEO...

18
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.180
Then forget it.

19
00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.440
No one says they don't support you.

20
00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:45.280
I'm with you.

21
00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:46.500
I also support Master Qin.

22
00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:49.700
You, if you do not support Master Qin, are my enemies.

23
00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:53.000
Master Qin, I was joking just now.

24
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.200
You're so smart.

25
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:55.280
The whole company.

26
00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.340
No one can compare with you as the director general.

27
00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.920
Young master, I say it is the truth.

28
00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.280
The great young master who has just entered the company has earned the company 1 billion dong, and you have not earned a penny in the company for so long.

29
00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.020
What did you take from the young man?
