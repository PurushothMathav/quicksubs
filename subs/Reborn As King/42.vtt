00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.140
Hey, beggar.

2
00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:04.360
Sister, it's not what you're waiting for here.

3
00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:05.160
What's noisy?

4
00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.000
All right.

5
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.400
Master Qin has already bought our game company.

6
00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:10.940
Let's go, sister.

7
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.480
How much does that idiot cost?

8
00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.780
15 billion 15

9
00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.100
All right.

10
00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:18.200
Startup capital is available.

11
00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.140
Go home, sister.

12
00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.240
That idiot didn't ask for anything from you, did he?

13
00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:25.400
What request can he make of me?

14
00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.340
Aren't you just going to let me give him a bottle of milk again?

15
00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.680
That's it.

16
00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:32.500
If not, what else do you think is needed?

17
00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:34.220
Haha.

18
00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.120
Ha, you scared the hell out of me.

19
00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.720
You're still good.

20
00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:40.360
Just a little trick cost that idiot 1.5 billion.

21
00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:42.900
Let's go, Mom.

22
00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:44.980
The lawyer just came to our company again.

23
00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:48.340
In addition, they also brought him under the ashes a game destroyer that the company sold to stupid Qi Fengming.

24
00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:49.660
Sell it, sell it.

25
00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.020
That idiot gave all the money he earned to small shareholders.

26
00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.300
What's so strange about buying a bad company?

27
00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.140
But he spent 1.5 billion.

28
00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:58.860
He's our headquarters' money.

29
00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:00.560
What?

30
00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:02.740
First he sold it to Master Li.

31
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.300
Now spend another $1.5 billion to buy a stupid game company.

32
00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.280
Between him and the Master Master, there was a fate that could not be told.

33
00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.720
Yes, I'll tell my father right now.

34
00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.060
Now the final result.
