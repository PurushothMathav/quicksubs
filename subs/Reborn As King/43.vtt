00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:04.000
Master, didn't you say Miss Lee came to send money?

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.620
Why spend $1.5 billion to buy a bad company?

3
00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:08.200
What company is that?

4
00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:11.280
It's a potential gaming company.

5
00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.220
What potential can a company that is constantly losing money have?

6
00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:15.600
You know what?

7
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.160
The company's games that I love to play.

8
00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:18.920
Will definitely cooperate.

9
00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:22.700
You like to play a low-quality game.

10
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.420
Can you cooperate?

11
00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:25.820
Is that possible?

12
00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.960
Come on, let's take a look at that company.

13
00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:30.780
Hey.

14
00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:32.720
Go.

15
00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.440
General Director Zhang, the legendary magic tower of our group has been inspected.

16
00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.380
Now it takes a hundred million to declare.

17
00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:42.980
Get General Director Zhang's approval.

18
00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:49.580
Autumn rain

19
00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:51.880
This fucking game.

20
00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:52.900
You want a hundred million choices.

21
00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:54.660
Your company's money

22
00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.060
General Director Zhang was blown by strong winds

23
00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:00.920
Of course, what about this money?

24
00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:01.640
I can give

25
00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.820
But you have to promise me one condition.

26
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.100
What?

27
00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.020
The conditions are simple.

28
00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:10.540
As long as you

29
00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:12.020
Good service.
