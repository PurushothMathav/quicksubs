00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:03.460
You don't need a husband, I'm wrong, shut up.

2
00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:07.120
The young man.

3
00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:07.960
I know it's wrong.

4
00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:10.340
Please let me go.

5
00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:14.820
Listen.

6
00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:19.640
In your previous life, you despised my life.

7
00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.520
If you beat me to death in this life, you will finally get the reward you deserve.

8
00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:26.460
Next is Li Van Hao, Vu Phong.

9
00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:30.620
Dad, I'm sorry.

10
00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.320
I can't blame you for this if I hurt you.

11
00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:34.500
Who can think

12
00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:36.740
The game company has been losing money for years.

13
00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:39.220
There will suddenly be an explosive game.

14
00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:40.860
Who can think

15
00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:44.740
New government team will delay renovation of new district

16
00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.300
Hey.

17
00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:49.240
This is all fate.

18
00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:51.440
But Dad, what are we going to do?

19
00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.140
All our family's money was stranded.

20
00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:55.920
Do you really want real life?

21
00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.140
Accept.

22
00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.340
There's still a chance.

23
00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:01.900
What chance?

24
00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:07.180
As long as you agree to marry a young man.

25
00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:09.940
We have a chance.

26
00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.260
Take back what was lost.

27
00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.380
Sister, promise.

28
00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.380
Dad, I promise.
