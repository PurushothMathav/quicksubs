00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:04.920
I can help you with this.

2
00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:06.900
Then I'll lend you the money.

3
00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:09.940
Can I borrow it?

4
00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:12.280
I want to borrow it.

5
00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:13.640
But I also know.

6
00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:15.060
That's a lot of money.

7
00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.760
My father wouldn't agree.

8
00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.720
This person thought about it early.

9
00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:21.800
So people think of a way.

10
00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:22.880
How?

11
00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.420
My family has a gaming company.

12
00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:26.700
It's very potential.

13
00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:31.160
Buying on feelings will definitely not lose money, this woman finally got hooked.

14
00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:32.560
If I remember correctly.

15
00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:35.000
It was when the Li family's capital chain broke down.

16
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.960
It was this game company that produced a game boom.

17
00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:39.460
Net income tens of billions

18
00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:41.260
Help the family overcome difficulties.

19
00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.740
Now he's giving it to me on his own initiative.

20
00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.620
Oh, this as far as I know.

21
00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:53.480
The game company you run these days has been in a loss-making state.

22
00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.020
If you want to sell.

23
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.760
How much do you want to sell?

24
00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.940
Even though that company has been in a loss lately.

25
00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:04.440
But the potential is huge.

26
00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:06.260
Buying animals definitely can't lose money.

27
00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.500
Right?

28
00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.420
How much do you want to sell?

29
00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:13.020
People don't want much.

30
00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:14.860
One hundred million.

31
00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.860
One hundred million, do you think I'm a fool?

32
00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.760
Why did Master Qin say that?

33
00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:23.820
Why do people think that?

34
00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.160
It's just, that company has tremendous potential.

35
00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:31.100
Second, it seems that Qin is lacking in helping people.

36
00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.140
As long as Qin is unwilling to help people

37
00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.380
The poor want people to do whatever they want.

38
00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:39.440
Really.
