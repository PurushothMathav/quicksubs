00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:02.140
Master is not good.

2
00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:04.120
The Su family is buying our shares in large quantities.

3
00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:05.540
Isn't this a good thing?

4
00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:06.800
Like this.

5
00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:09.220
Our company's stock will definitely soar.

6
00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:11.920
You guys are such good people.

7
00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:13.020
But, sir.

8
00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:14.040
Like this.

9
00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.540
Our family will soon become a major shareholder of our company.

10
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.620
Control will also fall into the hands of the family.

11
00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:20.680
Hey.

12
00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:22.820
That's a problem.

13
00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:25.020
Now I know the trouble.

14
00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.980
It's lazy, sir.

15
00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:28.820
So what do we do now?

16
00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:30.140
What else can we do?

17
00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.680
This is something I want to stop.

18
00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:35.100
That's fear.

19
00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:36.340
Why not?

20
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.580
We sold all the stock in our hands.

21
00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.660
This kid's sick again.

22
00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.340
It is not quick to buy back the shares.

23
00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:45.620
And sell shares.

24
00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.420
Isn't this like handing over control of the corporation?

25
00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:50.940
Master.

26
00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.360
Are you going to give up like that?

27
00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.700
What can I do without giving up?

28
00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:57.200
There is no family that has money.

29
00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.160
Sooner or later, it will be bought.

30
00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.340
It is better to withdraw at the highest level of the stock.

31
00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.780
Then I'll take you around the world.

32
00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:07.020
Not fast?

33
00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.300
How's this idea of mine?

34
00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:11.820
The wise owner.

35
00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.980
This idiot is so stupid, there's no cure.
