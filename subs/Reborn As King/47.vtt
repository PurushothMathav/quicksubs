00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.260
Director General Zhang, you didn't say you wanted him to come.

2
00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:05.220
How do you want me to die?

3
00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:08.480
My boss sent my boss a little helpless

4
00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:09.360
Don't bring it out for you

5
00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.260
I'm begging you to let me go

6
00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.720
Now I ask for forgiveness late.

7
00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:15.140
Pull him out for me.

8
00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:16.320
A broken leg

9
00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.080
This boss spared my life.

10
00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:19.280
The boss spared my life.

11
00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:20.820
Give me your life, boss.

12
00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.500
How can you become the new boss of the company?

13
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.700
I'm not here for you

14
00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.300
Because of me of course.

15
00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.920
I know you work for this company.

16
00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:37.040
So I bought this company for 1.5 billion.

17
00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.480
Do whatever you want to do later.

18
00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:40.280
Frequency missing

19
00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.620
You're so good to me

20
00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.260
Cause I've been so good to you

21
00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.180
How to return it, friend?

22
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.020
How do you want me to return it?

23
00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:55.140
I want to

24
00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:57.540
ban
