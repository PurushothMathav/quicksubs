1
00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:03.040
Yes.

2
00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:07.780
Young master, must complete double the performance of the entire company within 3 days.

3
00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:09.380
That's impossible.

4
00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:10.920
You shouldn't have promised him.

5
00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.120
Don't worry.

6
00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.840
Isn't it just to double the company's performance?

7
00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:16.100
It's very simple.

8
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.200
Double performance in three days

9
00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.420
Even God himself can't do it.

10
00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:22.160
Master, if you say so simply

11
00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:23.980
Looks like his mind is still not good.

12
00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:27.240
So what are you going to do?

13
00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.420
Me.

14
00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:32.260
I'm thirsty, young master.

15
00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:34.280
I just saved you.

16
00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.020
You still want to fight me?

17
00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.120
Go make me a glass of hot milk.

18
00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.500
Remember to shake the milk powder evenly.

19
00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:43.960
Young master, you mean to drink this.

20
00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:45.900
Don't drink this. What do you drink?

21
00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.040
Hey, hurry up.

22
00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.160
I'll have to go to Dr. Joe later to get the dowry.

23
00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.260
There is this of this dowry has not this achievement come?

24
00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.060
Go to Kieu's dowry

25
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.620
Does a dowry count as an achievement?
