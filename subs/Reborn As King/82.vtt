00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:02.380
It's cheap.

2
00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:07.060
What can the two young men do now?

3
00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:11.900
Wow.

4
00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:15.160
How were those photos sent out?

5
00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:18.680
Aren't all those pictures taken by you?

6
00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:21.940
As long as you have

7
00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.520
What, it's done, that bastard has taken all the company anchors.

8
00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:33.020
I have no access to the company.

9
00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:34.500
Who says no dignity

10
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.000
As long as he's dead.

11
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.700
The Qin are you alone.

12
00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.160
Miss White, thank you today.

13
00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.500
I'm not going to dig that many front-line anchors.

14
00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:56.880
Please, you're too polite.

15
00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:59.520
Without you, I would have fallen into the hands of recollection.

16
00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.400
Moreover, the live streaming industry has just developed.

17
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:02.740
The future potential is unlimited.

18
00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.580
May be the first in the entertainment world to eat crab

19
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.820
It's me, thank you.

20
00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:10.540
Stop! Stop!
