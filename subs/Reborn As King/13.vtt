00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.200
Honey, don't be angry.

2
00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:03.600
Isn't it just a hundred million?

3
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.420
Even if the flowers are gone.

4
00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:07.160
The wind can be recovered.

5
00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:10.640
Yes, father, what is a hundred million to buy a lesson for big brother?

6
00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:14.700
When I come back to the company in a month, I will plant it for you.

7
00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.860
Or is Vu Feng filial?

8
00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:19.460
Dad.

9
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.100
Hey.

10
00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:25.520
Dad.

11
00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:27.460
Phoenix.

12
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:29.860
You'll go take pictures of parishioners to play

13
00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:31.720
You can tell me directly if you don't have money.

14
00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.800
Why withdraw the company's money?

15
00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.500
Do you know what a disaster this would bring to the company?

16
00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:40.280
Dad, I'm not going out.

17
00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:41.880
I'm going to make money.

18
00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:43.020
Want to want to want.

19
00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:44.240
Go to the auction house to make money.

20
00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:45.540
You think we're idiots.

21
00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:47.040
Son of a bitch.

22
00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:50.380
Do you believe it or not, I ll beat you up and you re crazy?

23
00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.160
Her brother has worked hard to bring this company to its current scale.

24
00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.320
As soon as you take over, you'll withdraw all the company's money and go to the airwaves.

25
00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:57.320
You still scold him.

26
00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:58.500
Are you human?

27
00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:03.200
If he doubts my ability to make money, I can't scold him.

28
00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.920
Vu Feng has no doubt about you.

29
00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.300
Everything he said was the truth.

30
00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.760
The truth

31
00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:11.880
I made 300 million.

32
00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.200
Haha, 3 billion.

33
00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.960
If you actually make 300 million dollars,

34
00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.580
I just want you to give me formula right now.

35
00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:21.660
Okay.
