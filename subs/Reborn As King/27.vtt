00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:01.360
What did you say?

2
00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:02.000
Say it again.

3
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.320
Ma'am, the government just made an announcement.

4
00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:07.720
Want to turn Nam Son wasteland into a new economic zone

5
00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:12.000
Now, I said it's a feng shui treasure trove.

6
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.140
How could this fairy bottle lie to me?

7
00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:17.700
What if the government grows?

8
00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.120
Isn't it a loss to buy at several times the price?

9
00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:24.200
Yes, if you buy it at the market price, of course you can earn it.

10
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.280
But you've paid four or five times that price.

11
00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:27.860
Isn't this a warehouse?

12
00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.700
What if you don't calculate the price now?

13
00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.740
Sir, the government just auctioned off a piece of land this morning.

14
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.560
The price has increased more than five times compared to before.

15
00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:36.820
And it's still growing.

16
00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.900
Dad, how much is this five times?

17
00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.980
At least 50 billion.

18
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.720
Hey, just made so little money.

19
00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:49.940
How much do I have left?

20
00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:52.600
I probably don't have enough cows.

21
00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:53.920
Don't worry.

22
00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.600
I'll order a few more next month.

23
00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.380
Ha ha ha ha ha

24
00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:00.500
Right, right, right, right.

25
00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.700
We should raise some more.

26
00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.420
Sign up.

27
00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.120
You are not ashamed to be my son.

28
00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:10.620
That's Dad.

29
00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:11.960
Because I made money.

30
00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.840
Can I go to headquarters?

31
00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:15.940
Of course.

32
00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:16.980
From today on.

33
00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.820
You are the chairman of the Tan Thi Estate.

34
00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.680
Thank you.

35
00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.020
That's mom.

36
00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.260
Bet between us.

37
00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.820
Will you take care of me for three days?
