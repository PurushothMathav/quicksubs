00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:01.960
Qin Feng Miao, I heard you right.

2
00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:03.300
Your brain is teasing me.

3
00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:06.480
I am the sole heir of the family.

4
00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.820
Who can remove me from the position of president?

5
00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:16.660
Tiger, even if you explain the devil

6
00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:19.780
You have no right to interfere in our family s affairs, do you?

7
00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:21.040
Why not?

8
00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:25.220
Now I'm the largest shareholder of Su Group.

9
00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:28.680
More than 60% share

10
00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.140
I'm in charge of the entire board.

11
00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.700
What's the point of removing you from the position of president?

12
00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:36.620
Yes, you're better.

13
00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:39.900
How can you be the biggest dance of our Suzhou Group?

14
00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.820
You can buy shares of Qin Thi Group.

15
00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:46.840
Can't I buy shares of Su Corporation?

16
00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:50.420
My market value is three times that of yours.

17
00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:53.420
Even Tiger, you have no money.

18
00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:54.840
I don't.

19
00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.380
But Qin Shao has.

20
00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:58.480
It's even more impossible.

21
00:00:58.480 --> 00:00:59.720
This poor boy.

22
00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.280
He sold all his shares.

23
00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.320
He's not enough.

24
00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.200
You must be lying to me.

25
00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:06.060
That's right.

26
00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:10.240
The city's assets are actually more than our Qin Shi Group.

27
00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.200
Even if we sell out, we certainly can't make that much money.

28
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.440
Who gave me luck?

29
00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.240
Previously bought some virtual currency

30
00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:18.960
I've made 20 billion.

31
00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.400
Isn't this money enough?

32
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.360
200200.

33
00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.900
Fortunately this is too expensive 20 billion.

34
00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.660
20 billion is not enough.

35
00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.500
I forgot to tell you.

36
00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.100
It's beautiful.

37
00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:34.340
20 billion.

38
00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.220
20 billion 20 billion

39
00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.840
Well, I see it.

40
00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.700
This is the share register of Su Corporation.

41
00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.140
Also have shareholders report you.

42
00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:55.660
Used to embezzle company funds

43
00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.900
Causing great losses to the company.

44
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.340
Now you're under arrest.

45
00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.960
I'm a cop.

46
00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:07.900
Come with us.

47
00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:12.620
Winter Thunder

48
00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:19.680
Master Qin, I'm wrong.

49
00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:20.900
Please let me go.

50
00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:23.820
Master Qin, I beg you to forgive me this time.

51
00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.780
Okay, if you cancel your brother now.

52
00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.420
I'll give you one more chance.

53
00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:36.580
Okay.

54
00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.800
Sister, you don't need it.

55
00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.360
Li Minh Hao has since been deposed

56
00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:44.380
I finally got justice for myself in my previous life.
