00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:02.840
Master is not good.

2
00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:05.160
My dad knew he wanted to buy this company.

3
00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:06.460
Let you come back right away

4
00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:08.060
So I'll go back a little bit.

5
00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:09.240
I can handle it.

6
00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.580
Don t worry about working for good.

7
00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:18.900
He's a bit of a loser though.

8
00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.100
But it's really good for me.

9
00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.660
I won't let him down.

10
00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.220
Dad, what are you looking for?

11
00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:30.420
I heard you bought a gaming company for $1.5 billion.

12
00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:34.760
Yes, it's a game company with limitless potential.

13
00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:36.220
Infinite potential

14
00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:37.820
I heard you.

15
00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:41.340
That company's been losing money for years, Dad.

16
00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.720
If he doesn't keep losing

17
00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:47.120
How could I buy him for 1.5 billion dollars?

18
00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.060
Don t worry, it won t take long for him to make money.

19
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.640
How can this constantly losing company make money?

20
00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.060
And only you idiots can buy and sell for 1.5 billion.

21
00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:59.980
You clearly desire the beauty of the world.

22
00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:01.500
Use power for personal gain.

23
00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.420
Use power for personal gain.

24
00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:06.900
So Qin Yu Feng

25
00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:09.540
Let's make a bet.

26
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:10.900
What is a bet?

27
00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.220
Bet me within a month.

28
00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:15.660
Can you get 1.5 billion back?

29
00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:18.380
This guy's crazy.

30
00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.020
A company loses money for many years in a row.

31
00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.180
How can you earn 1.5 billion in a month?
