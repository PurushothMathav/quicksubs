00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:01.700
It's a little interesting.

2
00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:03.220
What bet?

3
00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:07.620
Here's a billion checks.

4
00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:09.420
Bet on him.

5
00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:13.360
You think I'm short of money?

6
00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:15.480
Tiger, if you think the amount is too small

7
00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.960
I also have shares in some companies.

8
00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.040
That's over 10 billion in total.

9
00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:24.020
It seems that Miss White in your heart is not low status.

10
00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.720
Be willing to pay such a high price.

11
00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:29.340
Can the Tigers accept the move?

12
00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:30.260
Okay.

13
00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.320
If you win, I'll release him immediately.

14
00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:34.780
Tiger Atmosphere

15
00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.780
What does the boss want to bet on?

16
00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.000
Hooke, Texas or yellow flowers?

17
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.460
There's no need for such trouble.

18
00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:42.660
Take a bet.

19
00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.680
Let's bet on this match.

20
00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:46.480
Wow.

21
00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.220
What is the match between Germany and South Korea to bet on?

22
00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:51.400
The distance is too big.

23
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:52.620
Germany must win.

24
00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:53.440
Pampo.

25
00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:55.580
I bet South Korea won.
