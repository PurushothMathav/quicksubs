00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.200
What? Or you?

2
00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:06.080
Such a simple honey trap put that idiot in an unsalvageable situation.

3
00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:07.440
After all, a fool?

4
00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:08.640
Which one needs a lot of money?

5
00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:11.100
I told him why he was arguing with us.

6
00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:13.300
There's another fool.

7
00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:15.060
It seems that Dongyuan and Dao are back.

8
00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:16.700
The mission must be complete.

9
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:17.660
Come in.

10
00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:20.100
How's it going? Mission accomplished.

11
00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.380
Master, the mission of atonement has failed.

12
00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.380
How could such a perfect mission fail?

13
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.100
Didn't he see you?

14
00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.800
No, he secretly took a video of us threatening him.

15
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.620
And wanted to use the video as evidence to sue us for blackmail.

16
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.460
The young man must save us.

17
00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.280
Master Lang Tu Er, stop fighting.

18
00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.600
Let's find a way to get the video in his hands first.

19
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.680
Or we'll all die.

20
00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:46.140
What request did he make?

21
00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.300
He said to let the Second Young Master prepare 1 billion.

22
00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.280
If not, hand over the video to the police.

23
00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:53.420
How much hum?

24
00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.140
Where can I find a billion?
