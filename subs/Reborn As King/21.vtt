00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:01.200
Ah.

2
00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:04.220
I know what that idiot did.

3
00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:11.060
What's that idiot going to do?

4
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:16.920
He brought back love.

5
00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.120
Go to the house and ask for a kiss.

6
00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:19.380
I want the dowry.

7
00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:22.800
Haha, the fool's mind is really different.

8
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.480
First of all, I don't want to say if the family is giving.

9
00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.800
Even if it is for the current generation.

10
00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.020
Do you have enough money?

11
00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:30.780
He lost this bet.

12
00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.460
I'll see what he does in three days.

13
00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:38.160
Okay, I know.

14
00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.180
Go.

15
00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:40.680
Okay.

16
00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.860
Just because he wanted me to take care of him for three days.

17
00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.420
It's dreamy.

18
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.480
General Director Kieu, this is the contract to buy the wasteland of your house.

19
00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:53.780
As long as you sign.

20
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.900
One hundred million will be paid immediately.

21
00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:58.160
Oh, that's great, Director Lee.

22
00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:59.300
I'll sign.

23
00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:00.140
Wait a minute.

24
00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.980
Before I sign, I have a request.

25
00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.260
What do you say?

26
00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:05.560
After signing

27
00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.580
I want you and my brother to get married today.

28
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.140
It's impossible.

29
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.900
Even if I die, I will not marry someone who considers me a bookie.
