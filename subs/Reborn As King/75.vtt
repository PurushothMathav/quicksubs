1
00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:01.660
make money

2
00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:03.580
How is that possible?

3
00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:06.840
If that company can make money.

4
00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:08.500
I can even sell it to you.

5
00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:11.620
Miss Li, the young master said it was all true.

6
00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:14.060
That company's new game has exploded.

7
00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.800
The agent fee alone earned 2 billion.

8
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.260
Two billion.

9
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:19.760
There's no possibility.

10
00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:21.680
This news is already in the news.

11
00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:23.180
The missing person can also go to check.

12
00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:28.580
How could that be?

13
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.060
So tell me.

14
00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.640
I'd like to thank you.

15
00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.400
If it wasn't for Miss Lee's generosity,

16
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:39.580
How can I buy a company that's worth more than $10 billion?

17
00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.820
Right? Even if it's cheap for you to pick up?

18
00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.100
New development area.

19
00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.340
Our Li family has started to invest more than 4 billion yuan.

20
00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:51.260
The future has developed.

21
00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.560
Profits at least tens of billions

22
00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:57.060
It's much better than your game company.

23
00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.060
Haha, what are you laughing at?

24
00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:01.540
I laughed at you stupid.

25
00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.080
You put all the money in.

26
00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.740
You guys wait for bankruptcy.

27
00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.360
A fool is a fool.

28
00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.780
You're jealous.

29
00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.320
I'm jealous, don't you know the government's about to change?

30
00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:15.680
The land you bought.

31
00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.340
It's not going to grow for a few years.
