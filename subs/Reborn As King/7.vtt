Entertainment how much working capital this company has left

2
00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:08.960
The working capital that the young master can move is about a hundred million more.

3
00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:11.800
Oh, you took all of him.

4
00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:13.700

5
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:15.720

Go to the auction house to make money.

8
00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.980
The young master still forgets whether you are the young master or I am the young master.

9
00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:27.340
Not even fast.

10
00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.700
You still want to be beaten.

The second young man.

13
00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:43.340
This idiot wants to take all the money to the auction house to lose his house.

15
00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.220
You're afraid you don't know.

16

There's hundreds of millions of treasures in this auction.

17
00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:02.360
I just called you and said that idiot took out all the working capital of the company.

18
00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:03.640
Go to the auction house.

19
00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:07.540
What's he doing at the auction house? He said that idiot had to go to the auction house to make money.

20
00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.760
Haha, a fool is a fool

21
00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:11.720
Think about going to the auction house to make money.

22
00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:13.320
You want to laugh at me, hahaha.

23
00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.480
Fools have seen a lot.

24
00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:17.240
I've never seen him so stupid.

25
00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.740
It seems that what we left behind is no longer needed.

26
00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:21.680
Of course not.

27
00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:22.860
With his stupidity.

28
00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.780
Fear of losing all of the company's working capital today

29
00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.580
You can tell your father when the auction is over.

30
00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:33.220
At that moment, I saw how the Immortals were protecting him.
