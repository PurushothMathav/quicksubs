00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:01.760
You want to make me angry?

2
00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:04.640
Oh, husband, don't be angry.

3
00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:06.280
Phoenix is already sick.

4
00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:08.260
Sometimes being confused is normal.

5
00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:10.380
Don't blame him.

6
00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:12.280
Dad, where are you?

7
00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:13.660
It's not because of you.

8
00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:16.760
I am because later I drink milk conveniently.

9
00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:17.940
Drink milk

10
00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.240
Buying that land is worth at most two or three hundred million.

11
00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.900
You buy it for a billion dollars just to drink milk.

12
00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.260
One hundred million is enough for you to drink ten lifetimes.

13
00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:29.640
Dad, you don't know anything.

14
00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.980
That land is a geological treasure.

15
00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.260
Think about it.

16
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.900
I splashed a tank of milk on that field, and put a few more cows.

17
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.740
That value will definitely increase.

18
00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:43.420
Stop making noise.

19
00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.840
In the wild land bridge in Nam Son, the two houses sold for many years could not be sold.

20
00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:47.680
Return the feng shui treasure

21
00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:48.780
Black wind tea.

22
00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.560
You're not stupid enough to be threatened by two families, are you?

23
00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:54.800
I'm fucking you.

24
00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.780
I'm talking to your father.

25
00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.300
He hit me again.

26
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.460
This drowning of yours is not the father

27
00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:06.760
Don't believe what I'm saying is true.

28
00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:10.920
The bottle told me itself last night.

29
00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.640
The value of that cow is sure to go up.

30
00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:15.940
Honey, don't be mad.

31
00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.520
He's just sick again.

32
00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.780
Let's call a doctor.

33
00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:20.920
You're right.

34
00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.840
Big brother is sure that the old problem has happened again.

35
00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:24.020
Go find a doctor.

36
00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.400
Honey, what are you doing standing there?

37
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.740
Let's call a doctor.

38
00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:31.280
Big events

39
00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:32.640
The announcement has just been made by the government.

40
00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:33.900
To develop Nam Son

41
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.820
Turn it into a new economic zone.
