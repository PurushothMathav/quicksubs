00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:03.200
Qingqing, why did you run out?

2
00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:04.966
Hello uncle yang

3
00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.066
Qingqing, you have to be obedient

4
00:00:07.066 --> 00:00:08.666
Can't run around alone

5
00:00:08.666 --> 00:00:09.966
Otherwise, mom won't be able to find you later.

6
00:00:09.966 --> 00:00:11.566
It's time to worry, isn't it?

7
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:13.366
You go back and lie down for a while

8
00:00:13.366 --> 00:00:15.866
Can uncle give you an injection?

9
00:00:19.566 --> 00:00:20.366
Zeyue

10
00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.466
That's the little girl I was telling you about.

11
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.800
This little girl has always been destined for us

12
00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:27.766
He just came out and called his father.

13
00:00:27.766 --> 00:00:28.733
He doesn't have a dad.

14
00:00:28.733 --> 00:00:31.200
Now finding his father is his only wish

15
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.966
Too bad he's running out of time

16
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.200
I can operate on him

17
00:00:36.533 --> 00:00:37.866
Really. Hmm.

18
00:00:38.266 --> 00:00:39.700
You can arrange it first.

19
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:41.600
I still have something to go to the dean

20
00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.400
You send me his information.

21
00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.500
Feel free to contact
