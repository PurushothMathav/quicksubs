00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:15.033
Qingqing Mommy

2
00:00:19.333 --> 00:00:21.900
Mommy, why are your eyes so red?

3
00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.466
Are you crying?

4
00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:27.433
No, mommy just blew the wind.

5
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:28.933
So the eyes are a little red

6
00:00:28.933 --> 00:00:30.900
Mommy, don't lie to me.

7
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.700
I hope Mommy will always be happy

8
00:00:34.733 --> 00:00:37.500
If my illness is really incurable

9
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:38.966
It doesn't matter.

10
00:00:39.733 --> 00:00:43.466
But if it really can't be cured

11
00:00:43.466 --> 00:00:45.000
I only have one wish.

12
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.500
Just to see my dad

13
00:00:52.266 --> 00:00:53.100
Please police officer

14
00:00:53.866 --> 00:00:55.266
You're going to be okay.

15
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.900
What's the matter with Dr. Yang?

16
00:01:04.933 --> 00:01:07.166
Assistant Chen, do you still remember?

17
00:01:07.166 --> 00:01:08.933
The one I told Zeyuan before

18
00:01:08.933 --> 00:01:11.966
A little girl as sick as his mother and me?

19
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.733
He's getting sicker now.

20
00:01:13.733 --> 00:01:14.800
I want to ask Ze Yuan

21
00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:16.433
Do you have time for surgery?
