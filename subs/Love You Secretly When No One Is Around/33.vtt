00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:02.600
Don't you dare, haha!

2
00:00:02.766 --> 00:00:06.033
Then it depends on Miss Lin's sincerity

3
00:00:06.066 --> 00:00:07.900
Sure enough, if there is a husband, there must be a daughter

4
00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:10.233
Thank you to this bitch's father

5
00:00:10.266 --> 00:00:12.033
It's not a good thing either

6
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.966
No, I have to figure something out.

7
00:00:16.066 --> 00:00:18.500
Uncle Ji, don't worry.

8
00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:21.300
I will definitely give you this money.

9
00:00:21.466 --> 00:00:24.066
Well, let's meet first

10
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.400
I'll deliver the check to you myself

11
00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:28.766
Good idea.

12
00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:30.900
Then we will

13
00:00:31.666 --> 00:00:33.200
It's a deal.

14
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.233
Lin Chenxi, hurry up and come out for me.

15
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.100
Stop selling me

16
00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.666
Miss Ji, your father was murdered

17
00:01:09.666 --> 00:01:10.800
You are now a suspect

18
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.066
Please also come with us

19
00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:14.466
What?

20
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.066
The season is dead

21
00:01:16.066 --> 00:01:16.900
I don't know.

22
00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:18.566
I haven't seen him for two days.

23
00:01:18.666 --> 00:01:19.900
We are on the knife at the scene

24
00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:21.100
Found your fingerprints

25
00:01:21.166 --> 00:01:21.866
And the scene

26
00:01:21.866 --> 00:01:23.833
He also wrote the word daughter in writing

27
00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:25.500
You are a big suspect now

28
00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.433
People can't be killed by him

29
00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:33.900
Mr. Huo

30
00:01:34.766 --> 00:01:37.400
I've been spending the last few days with him.

31
00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.400
I can give him an alibi

32
00:01:39.533 --> 00:01:40.333
In addition

33
00:01:40.866 --> 00:01:43.066
I lost a fruit knife in my ward these days.

34
00:01:43.333 --> 00:01:45.266
That person is most likely from me

35
00:01:45.266 --> 00:01:46.633
Sneaked the knife out

36
00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.833
But it's not him.

37
00:01:50.766 --> 00:01:51.400
That being the case

38
00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.466
Then ask Miss Ji to come back with us

39
00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.966
We need to talk to him about the seasons

40
00:02:00.333 --> 00:02:01.133
Respect
