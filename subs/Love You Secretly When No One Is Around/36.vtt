00:00:09.066 --> 00:00:11.400
Mommy, why are you unhappy?

2
00:00:11.866 --> 00:00:12.966
Is Mommy okay?

3
00:00:12.966 --> 00:00:15.666
It's good because of me

4
00:00:15.666 --> 00:00:17.233
Sorry, Mommy.

5
00:00:17.733 --> 00:00:19.000
How come?

6
00:00:19.366 --> 00:00:20.966
The premise is mom's baby

7
00:00:20.966 --> 00:00:22.833
How could I be unhappy because of you?

8
00:00:23.566 --> 00:00:24.366
Again

9
00:00:24.366 --> 00:00:26.966
As long as you gently and obediently take good care of your body

10
00:00:26.966 --> 00:00:28.266
Wait until the surgery is successful

11
00:00:28.266 --> 00:00:30.266
We can go back to our old lives

12
00:00:30.266 --> 00:00:31.166
Okay? Hmm?

13
00:00:31.166 --> 00:00:33.233
I listen to my mother

14
00:00:38.466 --> 00:00:40.433
I didn't expect you to be so sad about Qingqing

15
00:00:40.466 --> 00:00:41.600
The wound on the hand has not healed

16
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.400
I thought about giving him a preoperative examination

17
00:00:46.466 --> 00:00:49.000
I'm here to thank you next

18
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.466
Thank you for being willing to operate on me

19
00:00:51.466 --> 00:00:55.400
Mom said that a thousand paper cranes can bless people's peace

20
00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.600
So I learned to make a few.

21
00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.233
Hope you are safe

22
00:01:07.866 --> 00:01:09.400
His illness can't wait any longer

23
00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.166
Hurry up and hurry up.
