00:00:01.266 --> 00:00:02.300
I'm tired.

2
00:00:03.133 --> 00:00:05.033
I want to rest and go back

3
00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:16.366
Concubine Yanxi, what means did you use?

4
00:00:16.366 --> 00:00:17.400
public interest responsibility

5
00:00:18.133 --> 00:00:19.833
Since you want to invite responsibility

6
00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.800
Then don't blame me for being rude to you.

7
00:00:28.533 --> 00:00:29.366
Sister Ji

8
00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:33.433
Do you have the money to pay off the debt?

9
00:00:33.566 --> 00:00:35.866
Miss Lin still remembers me

10
00:00:35.966 --> 00:00:37.400
I was just looking for you.

11
00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.100
What are you looking for me for?

12
00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:40.800
What you have to do now

13
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.833
It should be to deal with Ji Yanxi well

14
00:00:43.266 --> 00:00:45.166
Grab all his money

15
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.900
Miss Lin, are you in a hurry?

16
00:00:48.166 --> 00:00:50.166
What about his Ji Yanxi?

17
00:00:50.166 --> 00:00:51.800
Can't come up with that much money

18
00:00:52.366 --> 00:00:53.433
To you

19
00:00:54.066 --> 00:00:55.433
Miss Lin

20
00:00:55.533 --> 00:00:57.866
I just heard a surprise at my friend's place yesterday.

21
00:00:57.866 --> 00:00:58.900
Human laughter

22
00:00:59.366 --> 00:01:03.100
It was you who got someone to trick me into gambling

23
00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:10.466
Pardon me?

24
00:01:11.133 --> 00:01:12.366
I don't understand.

25
00:01:12.966 --> 00:01:16.833
Don't pretend, I have evidence in hand now

26
00:01:16.933 --> 00:01:20.633
You'd better hurry up and get some money into my account.

27
00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.166
I'm going to tell you all about it

28
00:01:23.166 --> 00:01:25.466
Let you live a good life
