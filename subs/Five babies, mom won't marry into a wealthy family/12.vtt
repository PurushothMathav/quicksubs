00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.566
Find that woman

2
00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:10.500
Hello

3
00:00:10.933 --> 00:00:11.733
Xi Shao

4
00:00:12.333 --> 00:00:14.700
It's me Lily

5
00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:18.500
What's the matter? You've been abroad for V years

6
00:00:18.566 --> 00:00:20.433
I finally came back once

7
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:23.833
Then see if it's tonight?

8
00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.966
Xi Shao's daughter has left

9
00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:28.866
And I also asked for you.

10
00:00:28.866 --> 00:00:31.300
He really came here to sing about the family that makes money

11
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.500
Looks like I really misunderstood

12
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.200
Yeah, I'm sorry.

13
00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:38.466
I have something to do today

14
00:00:38.466 --> 00:00:39.466
Can't accompany you

15
00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:41.800
Ah, it's alright, Xi Shao

16
00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.066
Well, next time

17
00:00:49.333 --> 00:00:51.366
Who is the woman the knight is looking for?

18
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:52.900
Also surnamed Xia

19
00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:56.633
Will not be

20
00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.400
under the pig

21
00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:01.466
No way.

22
00:01:01.933 --> 00:01:05.200
I have to figure out a way to stabilize my position as Mrs. Xi

23
00:01:07.933 --> 00:01:08.500
piggy

24
00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.800
The news of Xi Shao's return to China written yesterday

25
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:11.600
Already exploded

26
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:12.833
Hot search

27
00:01:12.966 --> 00:01:15.300
Really? Well, let me see.

28
00:01:21.333 --> 00:01:23.566
This work is not at your own station

29
00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.166
I don't want to do it anymore, right?

30
00:01:26.933 --> 00:01:28.766
Director Li, I heard

31
00:01:28.766 --> 00:01:30.100
Xi Shao returns to China

32
00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.700
The news of marrying Cinderella seems to have broken

33
00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.800
Xi Shao is the richest man on the battlefield

34
00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:38.100
As long as it has something to do with the Xi family

35
00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.633
Are extraordinary

36
00:01:39.666 --> 00:01:42.666
Supervisor Li, then my news broke

37
00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.900
Can you let me dial it myself?

38
00:01:47.166 --> 00:01:49.700
News live streaming hosts earn twice as much as journalists

39
00:01:49.766 --> 00:01:52.233
I have to find some evidence for this matter, Xia Zhu

40
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.933
I wrote this manuscript

41
00:01:54.933 --> 00:01:56.166
Who to call?

42
00:01:56.266 --> 00:01:57.833
I have the final say

43
00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.533
Supervisor Li, how could you write it?

44
00:02:00.533 --> 00:02:02.166
This is obviously my manuscript

45
00:02:02.533 --> 00:02:03.633
yours

46
00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.700
Please read the signature first

47
00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:11.666
Director Li, I called you yesterday

48
00:02:11.666 --> 00:02:13.400
I reported this news in advance

49
00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.233
How could you tamper with the signature and my manuscript?
