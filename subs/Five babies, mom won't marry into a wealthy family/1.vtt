00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:03.766
Sir, sir.

2
00:00:03.766 --> 00:00:06.166
Please don't do this, I'm just here to deliver takeout

3
00:00:06.166 --> 00:00:07.833
How could this happen?

4
00:00:09.933 --> 00:00:12.500
Xia Zhu, why did you come? I'm sorry, Lily.

5
00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.533
I was late after class and kept you waiting.

6
00:00:14.533 --> 00:00:15.466
I feel sorry for you.

7
00:00:15.466 --> 00:00:17.466
I asked you to help me deliver takeout to earn living expenses

8
00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.600
It's all your fault for being late for a date

9
00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:21.066
Thank you, Lily

10
00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.600
Take the Vienna Hotel, Room 502

11
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.166
Don't send it wrong, Annie, slow down.

12
00:00:30.733 --> 00:00:32.833
502 is here

13
00:00:45.666 --> 00:00:47.466
It's me please

14
00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.300
I didn't expect it to be your first time

15
00:01:01.533 --> 00:01:04.200
Don't worry, you are my savior.

16
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:05.900
I won't let you be wronged.

17
00:01:13.133 --> 00:01:13.933
Xi Shao

18
00:01:14.366 --> 00:01:16.666
Did you find out who drugged me last night?

19
00:01:16.666 --> 00:01:18.100
It's okay to be incompetent under the tree

20
00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:19.933
Dare to drug me Xi Hancheng

21
00:01:19.933 --> 00:01:23.000
Even if you search the world, find him for me

22
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.266
Oh, right.

23
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.066
Thanks to a delivery girl who saved me last night

24
00:01:27.133 --> 00:01:28.500
He saved my life.

25
00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.466
No need to find him

26
00:01:42.766 --> 00:01:46.366
Oops, I don't answer the phone to scare the pig, which delays my work.

27
00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.400
Wait a minute this is a five star hotel

28
00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.800
You didn't sleep here last night, did you?

29
00:01:54.333 --> 00:01:56.433
Why is there a watch in this dress?

30
00:01:56.866 --> 00:01:59.633
This can't be Patek Philippe, can it?

31
00:02:00.266 --> 00:02:03.400
Did the man leave this last night?

32
00:02:03.966 --> 00:02:06.700
Hmm, it might be fake.

33
00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:08.933
How could someone like you be real?

34
00:02:08.933 --> 00:02:09.800
Versatile and laborious

35
00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.100
Then give it to me.

36
00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:12.966
But I won't bother you about my work

37
00:02:12.966 --> 00:02:15.366
Go bye but

38
00:02:21.066 --> 00:02:23.366
Xia Zhu's old hat doesn't know the goods.

39
00:02:23.366 --> 00:02:25.566
Don't blame me for being rude

40
00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.666
Wow, big ben, hahahaha.

41
00:02:31.133 --> 00:02:33.366
My luxury car comes with a watch.

42
00:02:33.366 --> 00:02:35.833
Moments that make you jealous

43
00:02:37.966 --> 00:02:40.166
Assistant Song, we searched the whole hotel

44
00:02:40.166 --> 00:02:41.500
Can't find the lady

45
00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:43.300
Who?

46
00:02:43.966 --> 00:02:44.766
What are you doing?

47
00:02:44.766 --> 00:02:47.300
I'm just here to take a look at the car and take a picture

48
00:02:47.966 --> 00:02:50.033
Is this Xie Shao's watch?

49
00:02:51.333 --> 00:02:54.066
Young grandma sacrificed herself and let me pick you up

50
00:02:55.066 --> 00:02:56.266
Young grandma
