00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:02.600
Doctor, I have compulsory insurance, let me do it

2
00:00:03.933 --> 00:00:05.900
Senior actually killed my Barbie

3
00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:07.066
How is that possible?

4
00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:10.300
Could it be that the man from five years ago was him?

5
00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:12.266
One thing you may not know

6
00:00:12.266 --> 00:00:14.933
Five years ago, I once failed a girl

7
00:00:14.933 --> 00:00:16.666
He gave birth to a baby in this hospital

8
00:00:16.666 --> 00:00:18.300
Then the child doesn't know where to go

9
00:00:19.366 --> 00:00:20.766
Not impossible

10
00:00:20.766 --> 00:00:22.300
Erbao is my own flesh and blood

11
00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.366
But the doctor just said he was my son

12
00:00:24.366 --> 00:00:26.000
Erbao needs to rest now

13
00:00:26.133 --> 00:00:27.400
Please go out first

14
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:30.233
We will talk about the future after Erbao wakes up.

15
00:00:32.766 --> 00:00:35.766
It doesn't matter if the man from 5 years ago is a senior or not

16
00:00:35.933 --> 00:00:38.033
I can't even give him the second treasure

17
00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:39.566
The child is mine

18
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.033
No one wants to take it away

19
00:00:42.066 --> 00:00:44.433
Erbao Erbao wake up

20
00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:47.233
I can't believe my child is still alive

21
00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:48.300
Not good, Mr. Su

22
00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.966
Miss Xia took the child and what did they run away from?

23
00:00:54.166 --> 00:00:55.000
What about people?

24
00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.533
I'm sorry Erbao is still so weak

25
00:01:06.533 --> 00:01:07.966
Brought you back

26
00:01:07.966 --> 00:01:12.600
It's okay, I'll get better faster by Mommy's side

27
00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:14.900
DA display

28
00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.366
Mr. Smith and this child are direct blood relatives

29
00:01:17.366 --> 00:01:18.700
The father of the child

30
00:01:18.733 --> 00:01:20.566
So what's going on here?

31
00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.566
Was that man really a senior back then?

32
00:01:23.966 --> 00:01:25.800
Toast without penalty

33
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:26.566
Let me see

34
00:01:26.566 --> 00:01:29.200
Your four treasures went to the west like the five treasures last night

35
00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.033
How did you know about the five treasures?

36
00:01:31.133 --> 00:01:32.466
Where are my five treasures?

37
00:01:32.466 --> 00:01:35.266
No, it shouldn't be that simple

38
00:01:35.733 --> 00:01:37.833
Summer Lily seems to know something

39
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.466
Maybe Wu Bao's disappearance has something to do with him

40
00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.800
And the name of Erbao's gentleman

41
00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:46.533
What exactly happened that year?

42
00:01:46.533 --> 00:01:48.166
I must investigate
