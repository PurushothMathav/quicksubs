00:00:01.966 --> 00:00:04.866
It's quite cold, it's really more like my personality

2
00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.300
Your mother had a difficult labor

3
00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:09.433
I'm too busy investigating to take care of you

4
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:11.233
You said that the supervisor does not care about the child

5
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.166
You're right.

6
00:00:13.566 --> 00:00:14.600
Now it seems

7
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:17.566
I really want to thank this woman named Pig

8
00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:19.900
Yeah.

9
00:00:20.333 --> 00:00:21.533
Isn't this a pig?

10
00:00:21.533 --> 00:00:23.533
How dare you make such a big commotion?

11
00:00:23.533 --> 00:00:24.733
I came to go through a formality

12
00:00:24.733 --> 00:00:26.900
This month's salary must be paid to me on time

13
00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:27.866
5,000 bucks.

14
00:00:27.866 --> 00:00:28.966
I made a special trip

15
00:00:28.966 --> 00:00:30.366
Look at your poverty

16
00:00:30.366 --> 00:00:32.233
Go wait

17
00:00:33.966 --> 00:00:36.766
Hancheng, I chose two pairs of shoes today

18
00:00:36.766 --> 00:00:38.566
But I don't know which pair looks better.

19
00:00:38.566 --> 00:00:41.166
I want Xia Zhu to help me choose.

20
00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:43.800
I have something to do

21
00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.066
Aren't you cute in your seat?

22
00:00:46.066 --> 00:00:47.000
Let him help you choose

23
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.566
It's just choosing a shoe, it won't take you much time.

24
00:00:51.333 --> 00:00:53.033
How's this?

25
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.200
Then what do you wear for me?

26
00:00:55.333 --> 00:00:57.900
Xia Lily, you even need someone to serve you with a shoe

27
00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:59.200
Are you crippled?

28
00:00:59.766 --> 00:01:01.366
Xia Pig, are you going too far?

29
00:01:01.366 --> 00:01:02.366
What's your attitude?

30
00:01:02.366 --> 00:01:02.700
you

31
00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.233
Believe it or not, you won't be able to find a job in Jiangcheng in the future

32
00:01:05.566 --> 00:01:06.500
Okay.

33
00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.566
Summer Lily, I can wear it for you.

34
00:01:09.566 --> 00:01:11.166
But we have to go somewhere else.

35
00:01:11.533 --> 00:01:13.200
You have to answer me a question

36
00:01:13.733 --> 00:01:14.766
OK

37
00:01:20.966 --> 00:01:22.000
If you don't want to

38
00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.966
Can refuse

39
00:01:23.333 --> 00:01:24.500
Cat crying mouse

40
00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.933
Xing Shao is willing to turn against the governor for him

41
00:01:26.933 --> 00:01:27.966
I've heard

42
00:01:27.966 --> 00:01:29.633
Why are you pretending to be me here?
