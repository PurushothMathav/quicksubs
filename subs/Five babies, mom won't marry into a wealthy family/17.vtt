1
00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:04.833
This is an antique Rolex watch.

2
00:00:04.966 --> 00:00:06.700
This is what you are looking for, right?

3
00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:08.500
Rolex

4
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.033
This watch is really similar to mine.

5
00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:15.633
But not my piece

6
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.066
Are you sure?

7
00:00:17.866 --> 00:00:18.666
OK

8
00:00:19.333 --> 00:00:22.133
This Rolex watch is too similar to Patek Philippe's.

9
00:00:22.133 --> 00:00:24.166
Even I recognized the wrong brand back then

10
00:00:24.266 --> 00:00:26.400
Fortunately, next week's local old cat does not know the goods.

11
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.400
I really thought the watch belonged to Patek Philippe

12
00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:30.900
Am I really wrong?

13
00:00:36.066 --> 00:00:38.200
Did you just call me Papa?

14
00:00:38.966 --> 00:00:39.800
i

15
00:00:42.333 --> 00:00:44.000
Bad guy you let go of my sister

16
00:00:44.066 --> 00:00:46.366
Little guy, your dog is so small

17
00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.100
Who is your father?

18
00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:51.066
Why do you call me Papa?
