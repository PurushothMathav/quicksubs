00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:02.966
Ah, I'm really sorry.

2
00:00:02.966 --> 00:00:04.500
I didn't mean to.

3
00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.866
If you don't clean up before get off work

4
00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:10.633
Don't blame me for deducting your salary.

5
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:18.500
Lao Jie

6
00:00:20.333 --> 00:00:22.000
Clean up here

7
00:00:30.466 --> 00:00:33.066
This used to be Xi Hancheng's office

8
00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.766
No, I can't be found by Director Li. I'm here

9
00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.200
How is the information of the current governor?

10
00:00:47.666 --> 00:00:48.566
Supervisor Li

11
00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:50.700
A whole week.

12
00:00:51.166 --> 00:00:52.800
Just find me a name

13
00:00:53.366 --> 00:00:55.333
Xi Shao, you don't know

14
00:00:55.333 --> 00:00:56.466
Governor Xuanyuan

15
00:00:56.466 --> 00:00:59.033
Although he has mastered the lifeblood of the entire Jiangcheng Chamber of Commerce

16
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.166
But mysterious and low-key

17
00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.300
I also found out that he had been living abroad before

18
00:01:04.733 --> 00:01:08.433
I recently returned home to find a savior

19
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.200
savior

20
00:01:10.666 --> 00:01:13.866
Who is it, I heard it seems to be a female reporter

21
00:01:14.466 --> 00:01:15.966
I don't know anything else.

22
00:01:16.933 --> 00:01:19.900
If you can't find any other information about Governor Xuanyuan

23
00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:21.433
Just pack up the pile for me and get out

24
00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.966
Yes, my subordinate will do it now, let it go

25
00:01:38.666 --> 00:01:40.666
Hey how are you

26
00:01:45.666 --> 00:01:47.000
Sir, this is

27
00:01:49.733 --> 00:01:50.666
office

28
00:01:50.666 --> 00:01:52.400
But I clearly heard something just now

29
00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:53.466
Go away
