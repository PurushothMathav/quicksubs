00:00:03.666 --> 00:00:05.066
Glad you're here

2
00:00:05.066 --> 00:00:07.166
An employee was rude to me just now

3
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.433
Who offended you?

4
00:00:08.866 --> 00:00:10.366
This is the woman.

5
00:00:13.933 --> 00:00:16.066
It's you who likes less

6
00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:17.500
You know him?

7
00:00:18.066 --> 00:00:19.600
Yesterday at the bar

8
00:00:19.966 --> 00:00:21.966
It was my preconceived misunderstanding

9
00:00:21.966 --> 00:00:24.066
You were gone when I went back to find you

10
00:00:24.066 --> 00:00:25.566
You find me

11
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:28.666
Did you go there five years ago?

12
00:00:28.666 --> 00:00:29.466
hi

13
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:32.000
You have no idea how vicious this woman is

14
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.366
He not only stole Director Li's Ximen Manuscript Sword

15
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.233
I want a million yuan

16
00:00:38.133 --> 00:00:40.966
Blackmailing you in the lower half of the river, you turn right and wrong

17
00:00:40.966 --> 00:00:43.100
Just say if you want to 1 million

18
00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.833
He has me to prove to Miss Lily

19
00:00:46.333 --> 00:00:47.900
I do want it

20
00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:49.466
But that's because enough is enough.

21
00:00:49.566 --> 00:00:52.866
I can't believe you will do anything for money

22
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.333
Ok hi

23
00:00:55.333 --> 00:00:57.166
Don't get mad at him anymore

24
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.066
Everybody listen up.

25
00:01:01.066 --> 00:01:02.500
In the future, this company

26
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.200
Lily has the final say

27
00:01:04.466 --> 00:01:05.266
Yes

28
00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:08.666
Then let's go

29
00:01:17.733 --> 00:01:20.800
Xi Shao, I can't even manage an employee

30
00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.866
Do you think I'm useless?

31
00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:25.500
You saved me back then

32
00:01:25.566 --> 00:01:27.100
I have always been grateful to you

33
00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:28.566
How can I dislike you?

34
00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.033
It's nice to like less

35
00:01:30.866 --> 00:01:31.766
But

36
00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.133
You said I've been by your side for 5 years

37
00:01:35.133 --> 00:01:38.000
People outside laugh at me for being nameless

38
00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.466
This time you go back to China

39
00:01:39.933 --> 00:01:41.766
When are you going to marry me?

40
00:01:42.066 --> 00:01:43.966
What is the Western Han Dynasty often hesitating about?

41
00:01:44.266 --> 00:01:45.900
He saved your life

42
00:01:46.166 --> 00:01:47.000
OK

43
00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:49.366
Just what you think

44
00:01:50.566 --> 00:01:53.566
Third brother, let's go directly to the company to find Mommy.

45
00:01:53.566 --> 00:01:55.400
Will it disturb Mommy?

46
00:01:55.466 --> 00:01:56.766
Heard that day

47
00:01:57.166 --> 00:01:58.300
Papa

48
00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:00.833
That's what it sounds like.

49
00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:11.433
Who are these two children?
