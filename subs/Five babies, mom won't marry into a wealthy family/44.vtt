00:00:01.266 --> 00:00:02.366
Sambo, are you alright?

2
00:00:02.366 --> 00:00:04.633
I'm fine, we're free to help Mommy

3
00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:06.400
Can't make mom richer

4
00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:08.866
Be careful

5
00:00:15.666 --> 00:00:17.200
Mr. Si, with your identity

6
00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.000
Why write to this strange child?

7
00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.266
We hit them both.

8
00:00:22.266 --> 00:00:24.000
A blood transfusion is appropriate.

9
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.966
And we're bloody

10
00:00:25.966 --> 00:00:28.300
These two kids look like they are only 5 years old

11
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.300
If my child were still alive

12
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.533
It should be the same age as them.

13
00:00:31.533 --> 00:00:32.266
Mr. Su

14
00:00:32.266 --> 00:00:34.700
Do you think this kid is a bit like you?

15
00:00:36.933 --> 00:00:37.966
Two treasures and three treasures

16
00:00:37.966 --> 00:00:39.100
Are you guys okay?

17
00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.666
Mommy, I'm fine, Erbao, he's sorry?

18
00:00:41.666 --> 00:00:42.933
The two of them were on the road just now

19
00:00:42.933 --> 00:00:44.533
My car accidentally hit them both

20
00:00:44.533 --> 00:00:46.600
The doctor said the other one is about to wake up

21
00:00:47.466 --> 00:00:48.600
It's alright

22
00:00:49.666 --> 00:00:51.766
You are a summer pig

23
00:00:52.933 --> 00:00:55.566
You are a senior

24
00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.300
Coincidentally, I thought it was the same name at first

25
00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.466
I didn't expect it to be the same person.

26
00:01:00.866 --> 00:01:03.166
You are still as beautiful as ever

27
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.166
Forget about the past

28
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.600
Can't write between close relatives

29
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.400
You don't know that the book you gave this kid can't be used

30
00:01:12.866 --> 00:01:16.600
Close relatives, doctor, are you mistaken? It's impossible.

31
00:01:16.733 --> 00:01:17.800
DA display

32
00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.133
Mr. Smith and this child are direct blood relatives

33
00:01:20.133 --> 00:01:22.566
It was the child's father who said how could it be possible
