00:00:04.733 --> 00:00:05.633
Thanks.

2
00:00:06.466 --> 00:00:08.600
What I hate most is unscrupulous people

3
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:10.400
What do you mean sir

4
00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:12.166
Do you want me to pick it out?

5
00:00:12.266 --> 00:00:14.400
So many people around me have to bump into me

6
00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:15.900
Isn't it just to get my attention?

7
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.833
Sir, if you are sick, go to treatment

8
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:21.700
That woman just now

9
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.766
I always feel like I've seen her somewhere

10
00:00:23.766 --> 00:00:25.900
Forget it, it should be an illusion

11
00:00:26.166 --> 00:00:27.766
You two stop for me

12
00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:30.866
Three treasures and four treasures

13
00:00:31.133 --> 00:00:33.766
Why didn't you just stay home and run out?

14
00:00:33.766 --> 00:00:35.733
Mommy, don't be angry, it's all mine.

15
00:00:35.733 --> 00:00:37.600
Don't blame the third brother

16
00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.166
It's all because I miss my mommy so much

17
00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:42.333
Mommy is not angry

18
00:00:42.333 --> 00:00:43.833
Mommy is worried about you

19
00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:46.266
You still sneak out like thieves?

20
00:00:46.333 --> 00:00:48.200
What if you get hurt?

21
00:00:48.266 --> 00:00:50.366
And what are you wearing?

22
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:52.166
Mommy

23
00:00:57.066 --> 00:00:58.033
Papa

24
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:01.966
Papa

25
00:01:02.966 --> 00:01:04.666
Dad is better than you

26
00:01:04.666 --> 00:01:08.033
Don't you want to eat? Pick up the car
