1
00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:02.266
Governor Xuanyuan is here

2
00:00:02.266 --> 00:00:04.500
Really let us have this awards ceremony

3
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:05.900
Shine.

4
00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:08.300
I heard that the pig will be shortlisted tonight

5
00:00:08.466 --> 00:00:09.766
I just got here.

6
00:00:09.766 --> 00:00:11.900
Otherwise, I wouldn't be too lazy to come.

7
00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:14.100
You actually came here to get off the pig

8
00:00:14.366 --> 00:00:15.166
Governor

9
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.266
Who is he to you?

10
00:00:17.366 --> 00:00:19.500
Stay safe little pig

11
00:00:19.966 --> 00:00:20.766
Governor

12
00:00:21.466 --> 00:00:22.933
You're late.

13
00:00:22.933 --> 00:00:25.400
The ceremony is over.

14
00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.633
Is it over? Oh, no, no.

15
00:00:28.733 --> 00:00:31.100
The current ceremony is not over

16
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.433
Just really started

17
00:00:33.466 --> 00:00:34.866
What nonsense are you talking about?

18
00:00:34.866 --> 00:00:36.500
Isn't it over?

19
00:00:36.666 --> 00:00:38.333
Obviously this award is mine

20
00:00:38.333 --> 00:00:40.466
Miss Gao, please forgive me

21
00:00:40.733 --> 00:00:42.366
Governor Xuanyuan is sitting here

22
00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:45.733
No matter how much money you give me, I can't help you.

23
00:00:45.733 --> 00:00:49.766
I'm sitting here today watching your awards ceremony

24
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.800
Is it a game of capital?

25
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.533
Still a fair victory

26
00:00:53.533 --> 00:00:55.600
Governor, I know you're good

27
00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.600
But I'm not a vegetarian either.

28
00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.766
You're saying that because I don't have enough weight.

29
00:01:01.066 --> 00:01:03.033
Then add my dad

30
00:01:03.066 --> 00:01:06.133
Is the weight of the international form enough?

31
00:01:06.133 --> 00:01:09.100
Ah, and my dad is better than the 40 group

32
00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.866
And my dad is better than the best actor

33
00:01:11.866 --> 00:01:14.200
And me, etc., etc.

34
00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.400
Why is your Barbie different?

35
00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.766
And he's still a more powerful figure

36
00:01:18.866 --> 00:01:20.166
Then leave it alone

37
00:01:20.166 --> 00:01:22.600
Anyway, you're going to bully my mommy

38
00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.400
None of our Barbies will

39
00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.200
Let it go
