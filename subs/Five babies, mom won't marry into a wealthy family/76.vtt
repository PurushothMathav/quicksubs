00:00:00.466 --> 00:00:04.266
Is the name Dad Bi Zhaodi bad?

2
00:00:04.933 --> 00:00:06.800
It's a very patriarchal name.

3
00:00:07.266 --> 00:00:09.166
His parents are too much

4
00:00:09.366 --> 00:00:11.600
It's better to recruit younger brothers than to come to our house

5
00:00:11.866 --> 00:00:13.066
Look at you

6
00:00:13.066 --> 00:00:15.800
You like that younger sister very much. I like it.

7
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.033
I have a birthmark on the back of my hand

8
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.700
The younger sister also has a birthmark on the back of her hand

9
00:00:23.166 --> 00:00:25.300
Dad thinks it's more coincidental than you

10
00:00:25.366 --> 00:00:27.200
You said he had a birthmark on the back of his hand

11
00:00:27.866 --> 00:00:29.466
Uh, really?

12
00:00:29.966 --> 00:00:31.433
Yeah, great.

13
00:00:31.866 --> 00:00:34.933
That's great, why are you so excited?

14
00:00:34.933 --> 00:00:38.033
That sister Zhao is likely to be your own sister

15
00:00:43.466 --> 00:00:44.666
Don't answer the phone

16
00:00:45.466 --> 00:00:47.866
Blind catch aunt is a good person

17
00:00:47.866 --> 00:00:50.233
Why did you do this to him?

18
00:00:50.466 --> 00:00:52.266
You won't be familiar with it for five years

19
00:00:52.266 --> 00:00:54.300
Your mother waved gently

20
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.166
You just ran away with him

21
00:00:56.166 --> 00:00:57.766
You are such a white-eyed wolf

22
00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.400
Dad, what do you mean by that?

23
00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:01.566
So far

24
00:01:01.766 --> 00:01:03.133
I'm not afraid to tell you

25
00:01:03.133 --> 00:01:05.033
You are not my biological at all

26
00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.266
I bought you for 20,000 bucks

27
00:01:07.266 --> 00:01:10.300
Is this bitch your real mother?

28
00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:13.033
Is this aunt my biological mother?

29
00:01:13.133 --> 00:01:15.066
Don't be too happy.

30
00:01:15.066 --> 00:01:17.433
This bitch got me wanted

31
00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.400
I can only run here to take refuge

32
00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.433
I will never let her go

33
00:01:22.133 --> 00:01:22.966
But

34
00:01:23.966 --> 00:01:26.300
And I want to thank you for bringing him here

35
00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.266
Gave me a chance for revenge

36
00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.166
Hmm no

37
00:01:30.166 --> 00:01:32.233
Don't hurt my mom

38
00:01:32.466 --> 00:01:33.366
Get out of my way

39
00:01:33.366 --> 00:01:35.966
You eat things inside and out?

40
00:01:35.966 --> 00:01:37.566
Don't hurt my child

41
00:01:39.266 --> 00:01:40.800
Don't hurt my child

42
00:01:40.966 --> 00:01:42.033
Five years now.

43
00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.500
I finally found you

44
00:01:44.766 --> 00:01:46.866
What a mother-daughter relationship

45
00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:50.033
Today I will let you go to the appointment of the underworld group
