00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:01.000
Sorry Governor

2
00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:03.466
You asked us to check your savior

3
00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:04.900
Still no clue

4
00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:08.466
Keep checking him but my benefactor is

5
00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:10.500
Governor

6
00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:13.100
Garden trimming loans

7
00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:14.800
Why do you need to do it yourself?

8
00:00:15.166 --> 00:00:18.200
I love these flowers and plants

9
00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.400
You don't have to worry about that.

10
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.866
By the way, I let you go

11
00:00:23.666 --> 00:00:25.266
Invite Miss Xia to the banquet

12
00:00:25.366 --> 00:00:26.333
Don't forget.

13
00:00:26.333 --> 00:00:28.233
Hey, I've woken up.

14
00:00:28.866 --> 00:00:29.666
Go hi

15
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.966
Lily, are you wearing the latest Dior model?

16
00:00:36.066 --> 00:00:37.533
Qi Shao is too kind to you, right?

17
00:00:37.533 --> 00:00:38.733
Everyone in Jiang Province knows

18
00:00:38.733 --> 00:00:41.000
Qi Shao has a Cinderella on the tip of his heart

19
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.466
Lily, when did you marry Qi Shao?

20
00:00:43.466 --> 00:00:45.766
Xiangjiang Province announces the identity of your young grandmother

21
00:00:45.766 --> 00:00:47.900
Soon, soon.

22
00:00:49.966 --> 00:00:50.766
Ah!

23
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.366
Idiots don't have eyes, do they?

24
00:00:55.366 --> 00:00:56.633
I'm really sorry.

25
00:00:56.933 --> 00:00:59.466
If you don't mind, I'll pay you for a skirt.

26
00:00:59.466 --> 00:01:01.533
You sanitation guy, can you afford it?

27
00:01:01.533 --> 00:01:03.766
We Lily are Xi Shao's wife

28
00:01:03.766 --> 00:01:05.700
It is a special guest invited by the Governor's Palace

29
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.200
You dare to offend the guests

30
00:01:08.866 --> 00:01:09.800
Why don't I remember

31
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.466
I had him as a guest

32
00:01:11.466 --> 00:01:12.533
You bad old man

33
00:01:12.533 --> 00:01:14.266
Just a gardener, what do you know?

34
00:01:14.266 --> 00:01:16.000
Hurry up and apologize to our Lily

35
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.166
Stop talking nonsense with him

36
00:01:17.166 --> 00:01:18.500
Something invisible

37
00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:19.800
Let me teach you a good lesson.

38
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:26.800
Stop it!

39
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.133
How can you join forces to bully an old man?

40
00:01:29.133 --> 00:01:32.333
This old man got my skirt wet

41
00:01:32.333 --> 00:01:34.733
I should teach him a lesson

42
00:01:34.733 --> 00:01:36.533
The old man didn't do it on purpose

43
00:01:36.533 --> 00:01:37.400
He's getting old.

44
00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.600
If you get wet, it's easy to get sick.

45
00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.266
You have to forgive others, forgive others

46
00:01:41.266 --> 00:01:42.400
Too lazy to care about you

47
00:01:42.866 --> 00:01:45.500
The business meeting will start soon, let's go

48
00:01:48.133 --> 00:01:50.466
Old man, are you alright? I'm fine.

49
00:01:50.466 --> 00:01:51.600
Thanks for helping me.

50
00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.000
It's your little girl

51
00:01:55.133 --> 00:01:56.800
Do you still remember me?

52
00:02:00.166 --> 00:02:02.633
Ah old man, are you all right?

53
00:02:03.766 --> 00:02:05.166
It was you

54
00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.433
I haven't seen you in a few years. How is your health?

55
00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.666
I'm fine, little girl, what's your name?

56
00:02:10.666 --> 00:02:11.666
My name is Xia Zhu

57
00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.800
I haven't seen you for years, I finally found you
