00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:04.333
piggy

2
00:00:04.333 --> 00:00:07.166
There is a shortage of a resident singer tonight, and the appearance fee of 300 will not come.

3
00:00:07.166 --> 00:00:10.300
I'm not coming, I'm looking for someone else, hey, don't, don't

4
00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:11.366
I'll be there soon.

5
00:00:28.166 --> 00:00:30.366
This is your regular singer at the bar.

6
00:00:30.366 --> 00:00:31.533
This is what my brother rewarded you with.

7
00:00:31.533 --> 00:00:34.200
Why don't you hurry up and thank my big brother, thank you

8
00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.400
If you want money, you have to do things

9
00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.466
Hey past

10
00:00:41.866 --> 00:00:43.000
Sir misunderstood

11
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.866
I am the regular singer of this bar

12
00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:46.300
Not with wine

13
00:00:48.766 --> 00:00:49.633
Come here.

14
00:00:50.766 --> 00:00:52.800
I hate women who pretend to be garlic like you the most

15
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:53.966
Work in this setting

16
00:00:53.966 --> 00:00:55.800
Isn't that what you want?

17
00:00:56.466 --> 00:00:57.533
Let go

18
00:00:57.533 --> 00:00:58.800
Otherwise, I'll call the police.

19
00:01:01.133 --> 00:01:03.033
How dare you threaten me with calling the police?

20
00:01:03.533 --> 00:01:05.000
Don't pretend to sell real gold spirits

21
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.600
I'll tell you what.

22
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.566
After drinking this bottle of wine, the 10,000 yuan is yours

23
00:01:07.566 --> 00:01:09.066
Otherwise you don't want to leave today

24
00:01:09.866 --> 00:01:11.633
Drink it for me

25
00:01:13.066 --> 00:01:14.433
water rolling

26
00:01:17.133 --> 00:01:19.900
Thank you for saving me

27
00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.566
I didn't expect you to be so scheming.

28
00:01:24.366 --> 00:01:27.233
What? I warned you at the airport

29
00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:28.966
I didn't expect you to follow me here

30
00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.766
He also designed me to save you

31
00:01:30.766 --> 00:01:32.400
I'll remind you one last time

32
00:01:32.766 --> 00:01:35.166
What I hate the most is the unscrupulous gold digger

33
00:01:35.166 --> 00:01:37.666
Do you think I'm deliberately delicate?

34
00:01:37.666 --> 00:01:39.166
Isn't it?

35
00:01:40.066 --> 00:01:41.266
Like you

36
00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.566
I think it's dirty if I look at it again

37
00:01:46.466 --> 00:01:47.300
OK

38
00:01:47.933 --> 00:01:48.733
OK

39
00:01:50.166 --> 00:01:53.000
Did you just say a drink and 10,000?

40
00:01:53.166 --> 00:01:54.833
Uh, yeah.

41
00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.100
If you add another cup, then add 10,000

42
00:02:10.933 --> 00:02:11.900
Stop drinking

43
00:02:15.266 --> 00:02:16.866
Is Xie Chao trying to stop me?

44
00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:18.866
But there are still 5 glasses of wine here

45
00:02:18.933 --> 00:02:20.766
One less drink is 10,000 less

46
00:02:21.166 --> 00:02:23.633
Are you going to replenish this money to me?

47
00:02:28.533 --> 00:02:30.333
Hmm, good drink

48
00:02:30.333 --> 00:02:33.433
Ok hahahahaha

49
00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.666
See clearly, this is called worshipping money

50
00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.566
People like you who were born with a golden spoon in your mouth

51
00:02:52.566 --> 00:02:54.633
Never experienced human suffering

52
00:02:54.733 --> 00:02:56.900
Why are you criticizing me from above?

53
00:02:57.066 --> 00:02:58.966
And pretend to love me

54
00:02:59.466 --> 00:03:01.566
It's just a few stinky money

55
00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:03.433
But blind

56
00:03:03.933 --> 00:03:06.700
I also think it's dirty to look at you one more time

57
00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:10.300
What do I think?

58
00:03:11.166 --> 00:03:12.233
Where have you seen him?

59
00:03:13.066 --> 00:03:14.033
I don't think so.
