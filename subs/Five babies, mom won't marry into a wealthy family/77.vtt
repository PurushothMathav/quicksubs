00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.866
Babies

2
00:00:08.866 --> 00:00:11.366
Mommy is just here for an awards ceremony

3
00:00:11.366 --> 00:00:12.766
You all come

4
00:00:12.766 --> 00:00:13.966
Is it too ostentatious?

5
00:00:13.966 --> 00:00:17.966
Mommy, your business is the most important thing

6
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.500
And Mommy, you're so beautiful

7
00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:24.066
Of course we have to dress up too

8
00:00:24.066 --> 00:00:25.933
Right, Sanbao?

9
00:00:25.933 --> 00:00:28.366
We cheer on mommy

10
00:00:29.566 --> 00:00:33.600
The Pulitzer Prize ceremony has officially begun

11
00:00:34.366 --> 00:00:35.900
Final review popularity first

12
00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:40.566
The second is Ms. Xia Zhu from CN Media

13
00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:44.266
And Ms. Gao Meiyun from Ruili News

14
00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:47.733
Yeah, I heard about that.

15
00:00:47.733 --> 00:00:50.000
That Miss Gao is a rich second generation

16
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.733
He was not shortlisted by strength at all

17
00:00:52.733 --> 00:00:54.900
The winner is definitely Mommy.

18
00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:56.700
Now I declare

19
00:00:56.766 --> 00:00:59.800
The winners of this year's Best News Awards are

20
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.500
Ms. Gao Meiyun

21
00:01:06.366 --> 00:01:07.433
How is that possible?

22
00:01:07.666 --> 00:01:10.133
The list of winners in your hand has not been opened.

23
00:01:10.133 --> 00:01:12.133
How do you know who won the prize?

24
00:01:12.133 --> 00:01:13.566
Children are less verbose

25
00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.866
This is not the place for you to chime in

26
00:01:15.866 --> 00:01:17.033
Why not?

27
00:01:17.166 --> 00:01:19.133
Xia Zhu was originally a little reporter

28
00:01:19.133 --> 00:01:20.833
It would be nice to be shortlisted

29
00:01:20.866 --> 00:01:22.100
Pulitzer Prize for Journalism

30
00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:23.333
It should have been

31
00:01:23.333 --> 00:01:26.233
Someone young and powerful like me

32
00:01:26.366 --> 00:01:28.200
What about a mother like this?

33
00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.100
You should take good care of your children at home

34
00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:31.166
It's too much.

35
00:01:31.166 --> 00:01:33.500
You won the prize through the back door.

36
00:01:33.566 --> 00:01:36.500
Stop talking and tell these little devils

37
00:01:36.566 --> 00:01:38.400
This is a game of capital

38
00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.266
Whoever has the money wins the prize

39
00:01:47.333 --> 00:01:49.466
Since it is a game of capital

40
00:01:49.533 --> 00:01:52.366
I'll take a look at this old man too

41
00:01:52.866 --> 00:01:53.666
piggy

42
00:01:54.166 --> 00:01:55.466
Long time no see.
