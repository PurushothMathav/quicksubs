00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:04.566
Mommy, are you alright?

2
00:00:04.566 --> 00:00:06.600
Dabao Sibao, why are you here?

3
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:07.533
Who called you here?

4
00:00:07.533 --> 00:00:10.466
Barbie brought us here Barbie

5
00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:13.166
Four treasures, don't call

6
00:00:13.166 --> 00:00:14.200
He's not your Barbie

7
00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.566
But he is my Barbie

8
00:00:18.666 --> 00:00:21.133
The little master has invited you all these years

9
00:00:21.133 --> 00:00:23.700
Don't worry, I already know everything.

10
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:25.300
I won't let you suffer in vain.

11
00:00:31.166 --> 00:00:34.066
You're back at the table

12
00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.000
You don't know the time you've been gone

13
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.633
How vicious is this woman?

14
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.800
He kept insulting me.

15
00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:44.300
I just taught him a little lesson

16
00:00:44.666 --> 00:00:46.733
Your little lesson is to cook

17
00:00:46.733 --> 00:00:47.866
Kneeling on the glass

18
00:00:49.266 --> 00:00:50.433
Five years summer lily

19
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.266
I discovered for the first time

20
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.200
Your methods are so vicious

21
00:00:54.333 --> 00:00:56.266
Sacrifice is not me

22
00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.300
Xia Lily, what about my two treasures and three treasures?

23
00:00:58.300 --> 00:00:59.700
Where did you take them?

24
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:02.600
Let go of me, I just let the bodyguard take it out

25
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.533
I don't know where to go. It's impossible.

26
00:01:05.533 --> 00:01:08.400
You return my child, don't cross me

27
00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:11.900
Hello hello

28
00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:13.100
Is that the lady next week?

29
00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:14.466
Your children are in the hospital now

30
00:01:14.533 --> 00:01:15.766
Why are you in the hospital?

31
00:01:16.466 --> 00:01:17.866
I'll be right there.

32
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.766
Xi Shao must have found something to suspect me

33
00:01:20.766 --> 00:01:22.433
I can't let him chase me

34
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.033
Xi Shao, you can't go

35
00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:26.933
I'm hurt too

36
00:01:26.933 --> 00:01:28.966
My feet hurt enough

37
00:01:29.533 --> 00:01:30.866
I already know everything

38
00:01:30.866 --> 00:01:31.966
Still want to lie to me
