00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.966
I heard that the young grandmother and brother go to school here

2
00:00:03.533 --> 00:00:06.533
My daughter is getting married to Xi Shao next month

3
00:00:06.533 --> 00:00:08.966
At that time, I will be Xi Shao's mother-in-law

4
00:00:08.966 --> 00:00:11.133
I scold you all because I look up to you.

5
00:00:11.133 --> 00:00:13.800
Miss Xiao, why don't you take the children away?

6
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:14.366
But

7
00:00:14.366 --> 00:00:16.166
The Xi family is not our little kindergarten

8
00:00:16.166 --> 00:00:17.433
You can all do it.

9
00:00:17.766 --> 00:00:19.933
Why are you bullying me and Mommy?

10
00:00:19.933 --> 00:00:21.266
You're going too far.

11
00:00:21.266 --> 00:00:22.133
What's wrong with bullying?

12
00:00:22.133 --> 00:00:23.166
I'm not just bullying

13
00:00:23.166 --> 00:00:25.300
I could even make your entire family homeless

14
00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:26.000
wandering the streets

15
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.966
Go away

16
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:31.700
Stop

17
00:00:37.466 --> 00:00:39.066
Son-in-law, you came just in time

18
00:00:39.066 --> 00:00:40.700
Xiazhu bullied me and your brother-in-law

19
00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.366
You've got to stand up for us.

20
00:00:42.366 --> 00:00:44.466
But I see how you say it differently

21
00:00:44.466 --> 00:00:46.833
You saw it all

22
00:00:47.166 --> 00:00:49.900
My aunt, even if I marry Lily

23
00:00:49.933 --> 00:00:51.766
You can't break into our family's banner either

24
00:00:51.766 --> 00:00:52.866
Showing off your might outside

25
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:54.133
Qishan Eighth Road

26
00:00:54.133 --> 00:00:55.966
Son-in-law, don't be angry

27
00:00:55.966 --> 00:00:57.133
It's all my fault, it's all my fault

28
00:00:57.133 --> 00:00:58.233
I'm leaving.

29
00:00:58.566 --> 00:01:00.800
Hey Xiumei, wait for me.

30
00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:02.400
Mommy

31
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.466
Will my brothers and I not be fired?

32
00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:09.200
Don't worry, you did nothing wrong.

33
00:01:09.533 --> 00:01:10.933
No one will fire you

34
00:01:10.933 --> 00:01:12.733
Why is it that every time I see this child crying?

35
00:01:12.733 --> 00:01:14.166
I feel bad.

36
00:01:14.366 --> 00:01:16.166
Seeing him laugh makes me happy too

37
00:01:17.066 --> 00:01:19.066
Does this child have anything to do with me?
