00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:02.900
Help me you will be so kind

2
00:00:02.933 --> 00:00:03.966
Certainly.

3
00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:07.166
I asked you to send me a child last time.

4
00:00:07.166 --> 00:00:08.400
You refused.

5
00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:10.300
Put this sentence now?

6
00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:12.800
It is also valid. You have to take away the four treasures.

7
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.966
Yes, you have to think about it.

8
00:00:14.966 --> 00:00:15.600
Now.

9
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:19.066
I am the only person in the world who can save him

10
00:00:27.966 --> 00:00:31.466
How are you thinking about Sibao?

11
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.033
I promise you

12
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.900
Those who know the current affairs are Junjie

13
00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:40.800
You are not too stupid

14
00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.333
Mr. Dai, are you going to take him away now?

15
00:00:44.333 --> 00:00:47.800
No, my lord has a lot to save you women

16
00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.966
If you procrastinate

17
00:00:50.566 --> 00:00:52.066
I regret it

18
00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.600
Just give me five more minutes.

19
00:00:54.066 --> 00:00:55.566
I beg you.

20
00:00:55.566 --> 00:00:56.866
Just five minutes

21
00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.866
Four treasures wake up mommy

22
00:01:06.133 --> 00:01:08.566
Is Sibao sick?

23
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:09.800
Eat a lot

24
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.366
Comfortable

25
00:01:11.733 --> 00:01:13.100
The doctor said

26
00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:14.666
You have a minor illness

27
00:01:14.666 --> 00:01:15.900
It will be fine soon.

28
00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.200
Does it cost a lot of money to be hospitalized?

29
00:01:19.566 --> 00:01:22.000
No such little money

30
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.300
Mom still has it.

31
00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:27.266
That's good. I want to grow up with my brothers

32
00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.633
Let mom have a good life

33
00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:32.333
Hmm mom wait

34
00:01:32.333 --> 00:01:35.000
Mom, is there something on your mind?

35
00:01:35.333 --> 00:01:39.700
It's okay, mom coaxed you to sleep home, okay?

36
00:01:46.066 --> 00:01:46.866
dead light

37
00:01:47.366 --> 00:01:48.966
Mom is useless

38
00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:51.700
It's Mommy's fault

39
00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:54.800
Sorry.
