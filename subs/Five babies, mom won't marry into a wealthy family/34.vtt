00:00:01.066 --> 00:00:03.800
No, my skirt got wet just now.

2
00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:05.866
That's why the old man gave me his clothes

3
00:00:05.866 --> 00:00:08.833
How can a nice skirt get wet?

4
00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:11.633
I think you are deliberately seducing this bad old man

5
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.533
Piglet heard that you have raised children for many years

6
00:00:14.533 --> 00:00:16.666
But no matter how lonely and empty you are

7
00:00:16.666 --> 00:00:18.466
No need to find a bad old man

8
00:00:18.466 --> 00:00:19.933
You can talk too

9
00:00:19.933 --> 00:00:22.333
Hmm, you don't understand

10
00:00:22.333 --> 00:00:24.533
Scare 4 children 4 mouths

11
00:00:24.533 --> 00:00:26.100
You need money to eat and drink

12
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:26.933
Maybe.

13
00:00:26.933 --> 00:00:29.566
That's how he raised his kids

14
00:00:29.566 --> 00:00:31.300
It looks very human.

15
00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.233
Doing this dirty thing in private

16
00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:34.900
I'm going to throw up

17
00:00:35.266 --> 00:00:37.966
Enough of you slandering me

18
00:00:37.966 --> 00:00:39.600
The old man is innocent

19
00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:41.333
Don't get people involved

20
00:00:41.333 --> 00:00:44.500
When is this still protecting the old friend?

21
00:00:44.733 --> 00:00:46.233
Shut up

22
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.266
Bunch of vixens

23
00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.200
It's hard to be elegant

24
00:00:50.366 --> 00:00:52.500
Do you know who I am?

25
00:00:52.766 --> 00:00:55.200
Bad old man is quite angry

26
00:00:55.333 --> 00:00:57.200
Isn't it just a stinky sweeper?

27
00:00:57.366 --> 00:00:58.666
Bitch admire

28
00:00:58.666 --> 00:01:00.966
Forever

29
00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:06.300
Old man, old man, are you alright?

30
00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.300
Are you all right?

31
00:01:09.366 --> 00:01:10.500
Come come come with me

32
00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:11.833
Miss, don't worry.

33
00:01:12.666 --> 00:01:16.000
Stop you doing such a dirty thing

34
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.833
Aren't you going to explain?

35
00:01:17.933 --> 00:01:19.566
What do I have to explain?

36
00:01:19.566 --> 00:01:21.333
I was innocent.

37
00:01:21.333 --> 00:01:22.900
You're just lying.

38
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.600
Pretending to look like a chaste martyr

39
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:27.300
Your wild children

40
00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.700
Wasn't it also when he was outside messing with wild men?

41
00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:30.700
Are you pregnant?

42
00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.466
Lower Lily, don't go too far

43
00:01:32.466 --> 00:01:33.966
You are the one who is too much.

44
00:01:34.133 --> 00:01:35.866
I thought I had misunderstood you.

45
00:01:36.066 --> 00:01:38.866
Now it seems that I underestimated you

46
00:01:39.366 --> 00:01:42.066
Xiao Hancheng, what do you mean?

47
00:01:42.066 --> 00:01:43.866
The entire Asahi Shimbun couldn't find the governor

48
00:01:43.866 --> 00:01:44.800
Any information

49
00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:46.500
You have someone who can sell it

50
00:01:47.733 --> 00:01:49.866
It turned out to be by this bad old beard

51
00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:52.366
Xia Zhuo, you are really capable

52
00:01:52.366 --> 00:01:54.700
Even I, Xi Hancheng, have been fooled around by you
