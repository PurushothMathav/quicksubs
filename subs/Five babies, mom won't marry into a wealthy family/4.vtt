00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:01.166
Piggy, where have you been?

2
00:00:01.166 --> 00:00:03.000
Director Li, I received information

3
00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:03.533
Richest man

4
00:00:03.533 --> 00:00:05.966
The only heir to the Xi family took Hancheng abroad for V years

5
00:00:05.966 --> 00:00:08.200
It is very likely that he will return to China and marry his girlfriend today

6
00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:09.533
Really? Five years ago?

7
00:00:09.533 --> 00:00:12.200
The waiter suddenly announced his engagement to a delivery man

8
00:00:12.266 --> 00:00:12.966
Curiosity from all walks of life

9
00:00:12.966 --> 00:00:14.766
What is the identity of this Cinderella?

10
00:00:14.766 --> 00:00:15.900
That's right, Supervisor Lee

11
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.333
If we can get exclusive

12
00:00:17.333 --> 00:00:18.866
Must be explosive news

13
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.466
Come on, such important information

14
00:00:20.466 --> 00:00:21.966
It's your turn to be a little reporter to find out

15
00:00:21.966 --> 00:00:22.866
Come back quickly

16
00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.766
Sanbao, we came out with Mommy on our back

17
00:00:29.766 --> 00:00:31.833
Will mom be angry?

18
00:00:31.933 --> 00:00:35.733
It's alright, Mommy may be working in the company now.

19
00:00:35.733 --> 00:00:37.400
Won't find us

20
00:00:39.333 --> 00:00:40.833
Mommy is really here

21
00:00:45.266 --> 00:00:46.266
brat

22
00:00:46.266 --> 00:00:48.733
Is it bad for the two of you to be discovered by the cat?

23
00:00:48.733 --> 00:00:49.566
Run!

24
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.700
Stop you two and don't run

25
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:55.433
You two

26
00:00:55.533 --> 00:00:57.566
Don't run

27
00:00:59.933 --> 00:01:01.833
What about the seven young lilies?

28
00:01:01.866 --> 00:01:03.066
Mrs. Shao

29
00:01:03.366 --> 00:01:04.566
He was a little busy last night

30
00:01:04.566 --> 00:01:05.533
Maybe not awake yet

31
00:01:05.533 --> 00:01:06.766
I'll call him right now.

32
00:01:06.966 --> 00:01:09.300
Since he is tired, let him rest well

33
00:01:09.466 --> 00:01:10.266
Come on.

34
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:11.966
Hey, you're so nice to him too.

35
00:01:11.966 --> 00:01:13.866
Sacrificing him saved my life

36
00:01:13.933 --> 00:01:15.766
It is right to be nice to him.

37
00:01:16.933 --> 00:01:17.733
Yes

38
00:01:19.366 --> 00:01:22.600
I'm going, isn't this the heir to the former group?

39
00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.700
Why do I seem to have seen this man somewhere?
