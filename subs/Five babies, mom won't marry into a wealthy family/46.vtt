00:00:01.366 --> 00:00:04.066
Don't cry since you don't want to be apart

2
00:00:04.133 --> 00:00:07.566
Then we can all stay with Mommy, right?

3
00:00:07.566 --> 00:00:10.466
Yeah, then I don't recognize it either, I don't recognize it either

4
00:00:10.466 --> 00:00:13.200
Mommy worked so hard to raise us

5
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.333
I want to be mommy's child forever

6
00:00:15.333 --> 00:00:18.900
Great, no one is allowed to tell Mommy about this

7
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:25.366
Hanging the hook for a hundred years will not change

8
00:00:25.366 --> 00:00:29.500
Whoever changes is a puppy

9
00:00:30.566 --> 00:00:31.800
Remember to listen to your teacher

10
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.066
Mommy went to work

11
00:00:33.133 --> 00:00:34.466
Cat, etc.

12
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.133
I want to eat too

13
00:00:36.133 --> 00:00:38.666
Mommy, I want it too, I want it too

14
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.100
Why are you guys so enthusiastic today?

15
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.500
Mommy is happy

16
00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.033
Bye bye mommy goodbye

17
00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:47.800
By the way, brother Dabao

18
00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.700
You introduced our dad last night

19
00:00:50.733 --> 00:00:52.666
So who is your dad?

20
00:00:52.666 --> 00:00:56.100
It must be the same scum as Qi Hancheng

21
00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.666
There is nothing to say about the management

22
00:00:58.666 --> 00:01:01.766
If it weren't for Mommy, we wouldn't have survived

23
00:01:07.666 --> 00:01:11.300
Uncle, are you introducing yourself to the international form?

24
00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:14.300
Why is he also the heir to the Imperial Group?

25
00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.400
Oh, so you know me.

26
00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.366
If you let the bunch of trash from the Ministry of Security know

27
00:01:18.366 --> 00:01:20.066
The national network was breached yesterday

28
00:01:20.066 --> 00:01:21.566
It turned out to be a 50-year-old puppy

29
00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.166
And he's my son

30
00:01:23.166 --> 00:01:23.933
I have no idea.

31
00:01:23.933 --> 00:01:25.100
And how would they look?

32
00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.966
It turns out that you are the replacement of Brother Dabao

33
00:01:27.966 --> 00:01:29.433
So handsome

34
00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.233
Hmph, I don't need useless stuff like Daddy

35
00:01:35.333 --> 00:01:36.733
The woman named next week

36
00:01:36.733 --> 00:01:38.566
That's how you're taught to talk to your elders

37
00:01:38.566 --> 00:01:40.766
Don't speak ill of my mommy
