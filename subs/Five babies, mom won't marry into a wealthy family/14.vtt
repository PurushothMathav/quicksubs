00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.266
So what if I was?

2
00:00:01.266 --> 00:00:04.500
Small lotus root manuscript can be a 1 million

3
00:00:04.666 --> 00:00:06.266
Otherwise see you in court

4
00:00:06.266 --> 00:00:08.666
I'm afraid you haven't figured out the situation yet, right?

5
00:00:08.733 --> 00:00:10.100
File a lawsuit with me

6
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.633
Even if you go bankrupt

7
00:00:12.866 --> 00:00:14.566
You can't afford it either

8
00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:15.966
Lower Lily

9
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.000
We were friends after all

10
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.800
Is it too much for you to do such a dirty thing?

11
00:00:23.933 --> 00:00:27.366
Dirty talk about filth, who can compare to you

12
00:00:28.566 --> 00:00:30.233
You don't even know that.

13
00:00:30.466 --> 00:00:30.933
Xia Zhu

14
00:00:30.933 --> 00:00:34.700
He often uses the company's website to post missing family notices

15
00:00:35.133 --> 00:00:36.933
That sounds kind of sentimental.

16
00:00:36.933 --> 00:00:40.700
Actually fooling around with wild men a few years ago

17
00:00:40.733 --> 00:00:42.200
Just got pregnant

18
00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.300
5 babies were born in one child

19
00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.966
You don't even know who the father of the child is, right?

20
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.600
He can outlive my dog

21
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.766
Why haven't you heard Xia Zhu mention it?

22
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.766
He was too embarrassed to say such a shameful thing.

23
00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.000
No, Sibao needs money here.

24
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.600
Besides, I haven't found the five treasures yet

25
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.166
I need this job

26
00:01:06.966 --> 00:01:07.766
Lily

27
00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:12.300
If you like this news, take it

28
00:01:12.733 --> 00:01:15.700
Let's stop this.

29
00:01:16.466 --> 00:01:18.000
So far.

30
00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.400
What you think is quite lily

31
00:01:20.866 --> 00:01:22.433
What do you mean?

32
00:01:22.533 --> 00:01:24.000
Do you want me to forgive you?

33
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.366
It's not impossible

34
00:01:25.366 --> 00:01:26.433
unless

35
00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.400
You help me lick my shoes clean

36
00:01:34.166 --> 00:01:36.300
Summer Lily, don't go too far

37
00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:37.166
unwilling

38
00:01:37.166 --> 00:01:40.100
I'll make it impossible for you to find a job in the whole of Jiangcheng

39
00:01:40.266 --> 00:01:43.700
Did you throw the security out?

40
00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:44.733
I can't go

41
00:01:44.733 --> 00:01:46.366
Don't want to go, do you?

42
00:01:47.933 --> 00:01:49.500
You know what to do

43
00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:00.366
How come?
