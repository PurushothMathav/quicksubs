00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.866
You asked me to make a deal with the child

2
00:00:01.866 --> 00:00:03.633
You're dead to this heart

3
00:00:03.933 --> 00:00:06.966
Piglet, are you polite to Ren Baihe?

4
00:00:07.066 --> 00:00:07.866
Mom

5
00:00:08.533 --> 00:00:10.066
He asked me to sell children

6
00:00:10.133 --> 00:00:11.866
How can I be polite to him?

7
00:00:12.133 --> 00:00:14.366
As if you were competent

8
00:00:14.366 --> 00:00:17.133
How did I hear about your two youngest children?

9
00:00:17.133 --> 00:00:19.500
Go out to work before your teeth are full

10
00:00:19.933 --> 00:00:22.466
It's really my fault that they work part-time

11
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.766
But as long as I can breathe

12
00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.633
There is no way I can sell children off the table

13
00:00:30.566 --> 00:00:33.100
Oh, Lily Xiumei.

14
00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:34.533
This kid is spoiled by me

15
00:00:34.533 --> 00:00:36.066
Do you mind?

16
00:00:36.766 --> 00:00:39.100
Piggy, what are you doing?

17
00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:40.500
She's a lily

18
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:41.400
Not what it used to be

19
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.066
You can't be polite to people

20
00:00:43.666 --> 00:00:44.966
Children are my bottom line

21
00:00:44.966 --> 00:00:46.233
It's not negotiable.

22
00:00:46.366 --> 00:00:49.366
Mom, I give you all my salary

23
00:00:49.366 --> 00:00:50.400
How much did you save?

24
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:51.900
What are you doing?

25
00:00:52.066 --> 00:00:53.500
Sibao is not in good health

26
00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:54.866
Surgery may be necessary

27
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.733
The doctor said the surgery would take 1 million

28
00:00:57.733 --> 00:01:00.300
1 million are you crazy?

29
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.900
I don't have so much money

30
00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:03.966
It's just the four treasures, isn't it good?

31
00:01:03.966 --> 00:01:05.166
Eat and drink

32
00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:06.500
Don't listen to the doctor

33
00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:07.733
He wants to cheat you out of money.

34
00:01:07.733 --> 00:01:10.400
Silly girl

35
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.966
The five treasures were abducted back then

36
00:01:14.966 --> 00:01:16.666
Only me and my mom know

37
00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:19.500
Everyone thought I gave birth to 4

38
00:01:19.866 --> 00:01:22.566
How did the next lily know that I gave birth to 5?

39
00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.800
I heard you gave birth to 5 oil bottles in one go
