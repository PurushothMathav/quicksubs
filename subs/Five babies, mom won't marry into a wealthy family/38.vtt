00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:01.966
Sir, you are absolutely authentic

2
00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:10.566
Sir, you asked me to investigate leprechauns

3
00:00:10.566 --> 00:00:12.100
I have snuck into his house

4
00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:13.933
Found something suspicious

5
00:00:13.933 --> 00:00:15.100
I don't know.

6
00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:17.833
I have sent you the work of what I found.

7
00:00:20.533 --> 00:00:21.466
quilt

8
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:26.566
This quilt, this quilt was the quilt that night

9
00:00:26.666 --> 00:00:28.200
I didn't expect to be in the Zhu family.

10
00:00:30.333 --> 00:00:31.600
It was him

11
00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:34.700
I didn't expect it to be him

12
00:00:35.966 --> 00:00:37.700
The nearest location was scammed.

13
00:00:44.266 --> 00:00:45.266
Four treasures don't cry

14
00:00:45.266 --> 00:00:47.966
Mommy should be at this hotel

15
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:54.800
Don't be afraid, Dad will take you to Mommy

16
00:00:55.133 --> 00:00:56.633
Will it be good?

17
00:00:57.866 --> 00:00:59.333
You want money?

18
00:00:59.333 --> 00:01:01.700
Then come here, come here

19
00:01:05.166 --> 00:01:05.966
Thanks.

20
00:01:07.133 --> 00:01:08.633
I'm on my knees

21
00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:10.433
Do you want to go back on it?

22
00:01:10.566 --> 00:01:12.833
I can give you this money.

23
00:01:12.966 --> 00:01:15.033
But you have to promise me one condition.

24
00:01:15.266 --> 00:01:17.066
I'll give you the money.

25
00:01:17.066 --> 00:01:19.466
You give me your daughter

26
00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:21.633
You haven't given up yet

27
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.666
I will not give you my daughter

28
00:01:23.666 --> 00:01:25.766
Why did you have to take my daughter?

29
00:01:25.766 --> 00:01:27.200
You don't have to worry about that.

30
00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.966
Your daughter following you is a dead end

31
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.466
Following me is the right choice

32
00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.800
Sayuri, you don't know anything at all

33
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.633
Sibo is just a tool for you to compete for favor

34
00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:40.666
You won't treat him well at all

35
00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:42.733
But he is my own flesh and blood

36
00:01:42.733 --> 00:01:44.600
The child I raised

37
00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:46.633
Blood is thicker than water

38
00:01:46.766 --> 00:01:49.300
I won't give him to you even if I die

39
00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:50.200
Toast without eating

40
00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:51.300
It's a penalty drink

41
00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:52.100
Let me see

42
00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.866
Your four treasures will go to the west like the five treasures sooner or later

43
00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:56.733
How did you know about the five treasures?

44
00:01:56.733 --> 00:01:58.233
Where are my five treasures?

45
00:01:58.466 --> 00:01:59.300
Less verbose

46
00:01:59.333 --> 00:02:02.033
I don't know what five treasures or not, go away

47
00:02:02.733 --> 00:02:03.766
Catch him for me

48
00:02:03.766 --> 00:02:05.166
Show him some color

49
00:02:05.733 --> 00:02:06.633
Stop

50
00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.033
Mommy, are you alright?
