00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:03.666
Xi Shao, what are you looking for?

2
00:00:05.666 --> 00:00:07.333
Why did Xi Shao suddenly come back?

3
00:00:07.333 --> 00:00:10.600
No, the more contact he has with Xia Zhu, the more dangerous I am

4
00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:11.866
I have to figure something out.

5
00:00:11.933 --> 00:00:15.500
Lily, I really can't lose this job

6
00:00:15.733 --> 00:00:16.800
Ha Zhu

7
00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:20.800
It's not impossible for me to let you go

8
00:00:20.866 --> 00:00:23.933
I told you yesterday to give me a child to raise.

9
00:00:23.933 --> 00:00:25.300
How do you think about it?

10
00:00:25.666 --> 00:00:28.000
Impossible fool

11
00:00:28.466 --> 00:00:30.466
Believe it or not, I have a way

12
00:00:30.466 --> 00:00:32.566
Let your bunch of bastards come with you

13
00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:33.900
Living on the street

14
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:35.000
Can you do it?

15
00:00:36.766 --> 00:00:37.666
What are you doing?

16
00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:42.766
Kneel down and apologize

17
00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.000
Otherwise you will have no place on the river

18
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.233
I won't apologize.

19
00:00:51.733 --> 00:00:54.366
I'm quitting next week

20
00:01:00.466 --> 00:01:01.366
What do you want?

21
00:01:01.366 --> 00:01:03.300
Now that I'm unemployed

22
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.866
Give me back that watch

23
00:01:04.966 --> 00:01:07.433
The watch you stole

24
00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:09.600
Pardon me?

25
00:01:09.766 --> 00:01:10.600
I don't understand.

26
00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.300
The hem and you still wear it.

27
00:01:12.466 --> 00:01:14.633
Don't you usually like watches the most?

28
00:01:14.733 --> 00:01:17.166
That watch must have been worth a lot of money back then

29
00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:18.666
I happen to be unemployed

30
00:01:18.666 --> 00:01:20.166
Is short of money to support children

31
00:01:20.166 --> 00:01:22.400
Are you going to give me back what you stole from me?

32
00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:23.200
early summer

33
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.266
I have already grown up with a lot of things today.

34
00:01:25.266 --> 00:01:27.266
I don't care about you, get out

35
00:01:27.733 --> 00:01:29.000
Don't bully my mommy

36
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.166
My mommy hurry up and get out

37
00:01:31.166 --> 00:01:33.266
Why does this kid look like a thin tip?

38
00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:38.366
A small hospital in the county seat a year ago

39
00:01:38.366 --> 00:01:39.466
There are still your enemies

40
00:01:39.566 --> 00:01:41.300
Your child was born

41
00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:42.766
Stop

42
00:01:43.533 --> 00:01:44.500
Xi Shao

43
00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:47.300
Dad, save us

44
00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.800
Is this the watch you just mentioned?
