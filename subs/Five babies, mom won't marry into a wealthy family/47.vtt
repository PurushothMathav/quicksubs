00:00:00.566 --> 00:00:02.166
You little fools

2
00:00:02.166 --> 00:00:04.933
Aren't you curious? There is only one mommy.

3
00:00:04.933 --> 00:00:06.400
Barbie has a lot

4
00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.200
Yeah, why?

5
00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:11.166
And that's what I'm going to talk to you about.

6
00:00:11.166 --> 00:00:12.200
This afternoon.

7
00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:13.166
Xi Hancheng's

8
00:00:13.166 --> 00:00:16.900
My subordinates found the hospital where Mommy gave birth to us.

9
00:00:17.066 --> 00:00:18.733
I'll follow along

10
00:00:18.733 --> 00:00:20.966
I didn't expect to find it by accident

11
00:00:20.966 --> 00:00:23.800
Mommy gave birth to us five years ago

12
00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:28.266
Five years ago, the next lily took advantage of mommy to give birth

13
00:00:28.266 --> 00:00:30.166
Secretly bribing doctors

14
00:00:30.166 --> 00:00:33.266
Carried the three of us to Mommy

15
00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.966
Let me see my child

16
00:00:39.266 --> 00:00:40.666
Miss Xia Miss Xia

17
00:00:40.666 --> 00:00:44.200
You gave birth to quintuplets, quintuplets.

18
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.900
So the three of us are actually

19
00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:50.300
They are not Mommy's biological children

20
00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:55.100
Just an orphan who was not adopted in the hospital

21
00:00:55.333 --> 00:00:57.200
Why would Schauberger do this?

22
00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:58.900
Of course because

23
00:00:58.966 --> 00:01:00.200
Chabajo

24
00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:04.333
I want Mommy to work hard for a lifetime to raise children for others

25
00:01:04.333 --> 00:01:05.933
Finally exhausted

26
00:01:05.933 --> 00:01:08.100
This bad woman is too much

27
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.500
I'm not Mommy's child

28
00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.533
We are even a burden to Mommy

29
00:01:12.533 --> 00:01:14.566
These years have dragged down mommy

30
00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.100
How about we recognize each other better than our father?

31
00:01:17.366 --> 00:01:19.966
This will also allow our dad to help

32
00:01:20.566 --> 00:01:22.700
I think our biological father is better than

33
00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.533
It can lighten the burden on mommy

34
00:01:24.533 --> 00:01:25.700
Absolutely not.

35
00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.066
Our own fathers are so good

36
00:01:28.066 --> 00:01:29.066
If we recognize each other

37
00:01:29.066 --> 00:01:33.800
They will definitely take you away from mommy

38
00:01:33.933 --> 00:01:36.533
Then you'll never see Mommy again

39
00:01:36.533 --> 00:01:37.866
I don't want I don't want

40
00:01:37.866 --> 00:01:39.866
I don't want to be separated from my brothers

41
00:01:39.866 --> 00:01:41.333
I don't want to leave Mommy

42
00:01:41.333 --> 00:01:43.033
I don't want it either.

43
00:01:43.766 --> 00:01:44.766
Ah!
