00:00:01.933 --> 00:00:04.200
I can't believe I gave birth to 5

2
00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:06.666
Don't worry, babies.

3
00:00:07.066 --> 00:00:09.500
Mom will do her best to take care of you

4
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:19.600
Miss Xia, don't worry.

5
00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.500
Your matter has been done.

6
00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.166
He can't give birth to five sows.

7
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:26.966
Good job.

8
00:00:27.066 --> 00:00:28.300
What about the child I want?

9
00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:30.766
What you told me has naturally been done.

10
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.533
The child is so beautiful

11
00:00:34.533 --> 00:00:36.866
I don't know if his father is in charge here

12
00:00:37.133 --> 00:00:39.166
It's none of your business. Go away

13
00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.000
Where is my child?

14
00:01:01.566 --> 00:01:03.266
Lily, you really brought the child out

15
00:01:03.266 --> 00:01:06.000
When the shrimp pig wakes up, the child can't see him

16
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.366
Naturally go to him

17
00:01:07.366 --> 00:01:08.900
I have to look for children everywhere for the rest of my life

18
00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.200
Naturally, there is no time to compete with me

19
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.566
This kid is pretty cute

20
00:01:13.566 --> 00:01:15.233
Wait for the money

21
00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:17.500
Mom, we're not short of money now

22
00:01:17.533 --> 00:01:18.766
You have to ask for money

23
00:01:18.766 --> 00:01:19.833
Society hates too much money

24
00:01:20.066 --> 00:01:21.300
Hey, don't worry.

25
00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:22.666
We understand the rules of the road

26
00:01:22.666 --> 00:01:24.166
one hand pay one hand delivery

27
00:01:24.166 --> 00:01:25.966
Is it necessary for you?

28
00:01:35.066 --> 00:01:36.666
Who are you? This is my child

29
00:01:36.666 --> 00:01:38.500
You can't take my baby away from me

30
00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:40.200
I beg you.

31
00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.366
Give me back the baby and let go of your father

32
00:01:42.366 --> 00:01:44.966
Were you struck by lightning for China's rebellion?

33
00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:49.366
Who's there?
