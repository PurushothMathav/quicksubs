00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.133
You said the handsome uncle during the day

2
00:00:11.133 --> 00:00:13.333
Is it really our own father?

3
00:00:13.333 --> 00:00:16.366
Impossible, our dad must be West Han City

4
00:00:16.366 --> 00:00:18.300
My intuition is not wrong.

5
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.066
We have been living with Mommy for the past 5 years

6
00:00:21.066 --> 00:00:22.866
I've never seen Papa

7
00:00:23.066 --> 00:00:24.166
That's good.

8
00:00:24.166 --> 00:00:25.000
Or don't come

9
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.200
One come two

10
00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.366
Which one is the real dad?

11
00:00:28.366 --> 00:00:29.800
Hey.

12
00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.900
In fact, we have more than two dads

13
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:36.100
But four

14
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.066
How did that happen?

15
00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:45.133
afternoon

16
00:00:45.133 --> 00:00:48.600
This poem by Mr. Velvet got me started.

17
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.900
So I secretly matched into the Chinese DNA database

18
00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:54.966
A big data match

19
00:00:54.966 --> 00:00:58.000
Turns out we Barbies are all different

20
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.266
Erbao's Barbie Pride

21
00:01:00.366 --> 00:01:02.566
30-Year-old group president

22
00:01:02.566 --> 00:01:05.100
Number of assets under name 11

23
00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.433
Sanbao's Bandipei

24
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.900
At the age of 28, he is a first-class music superstar

25
00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:13.600
Fans all over the world

26
00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.500
He doesn't need to introduce himself at the age of 28 in Korea and North Korea

27
00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.466
Is he the richest man in our province?

28
00:01:20.466 --> 00:01:22.600
I know, it's shocking.

29
00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.066
But it's all true

30
00:01:25.333 --> 00:01:28.166
Haha my dad is so much better than velvet paper

31
00:01:28.166 --> 00:01:30.700
No wonder Xiaoyu is so talented in music

32
00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.733
Turns out my dad is a big star

33
00:01:32.733 --> 00:01:36.066
It turns out that my father is the richest man

34
00:01:36.066 --> 00:01:38.066
Mommy found 4 dads

35
00:01:38.066 --> 00:01:39.900
She gave birth to four children.

36
00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.400
Mommy is really awesome
