00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:01.900
piggy

2
00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:04.066
You have four children by yourself

3
00:00:04.066 --> 00:00:05.766
How did all these years come about?

4
00:00:05.766 --> 00:00:08.533
Don't worry, I won't let you suffer again in the future.

5
00:00:08.533 --> 00:00:10.000
It's Erbao Dad

6
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:10.866
Long time no see!

7
00:00:10.866 --> 00:00:12.466
Sibao, get in the car

8
00:00:14.166 --> 00:00:15.000
Papa

9
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.166
Could it be that Si Shao is the father of Miss Xia's child?

10
00:00:18.166 --> 00:00:19.533
Turns out he has a husband

11
00:00:19.533 --> 00:00:21.433
Do you still do that paternity test?

12
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.266
It seems that I misunderstood

13
00:00:26.133 --> 00:00:28.200
Mr. S is investigating my home address again

14
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:29.566
Came for me again

15
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:31.166
What exactly do you want to do?

16
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:32.700
Last time you called me senior

17
00:00:32.766 --> 00:00:34.266
This time you call me Mr. Si

18
00:00:34.466 --> 00:00:35.900
It's a little rusty outside

19
00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:37.166
You don't have to be too nervous.

20
00:00:37.333 --> 00:00:39.133
This time I'm actually here for you

21
00:00:39.133 --> 00:00:42.666
I'm right, you were our Media Muse back then

22
00:00:42.666 --> 00:00:43.766
superior ability

23
00:00:44.066 --> 00:00:46.400
Stuck in that little provocative news

24
00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:47.466
I really feel wronged by you.

25
00:00:47.466 --> 00:00:49.000
Since you're leaving now

26
00:00:49.133 --> 00:00:51.400
I now cordially invite you to join CN Media

27
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:52.566
Haodazhan Full Award

28
00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:53.733
But relatively

29
00:00:53.733 --> 00:00:55.800
I hope you can let me come and see Erbao often.

30
00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.866
Let me step into being a father

31
00:00:57.866 --> 00:01:00.233
The senior really went to great lengths for the second treasure

32
00:01:00.866 --> 00:01:01.933
You'd better give up.

33
00:01:01.933 --> 00:01:02.966
I as a mother

34
00:01:02.966 --> 00:01:04.166
No matter how hard it is

35
00:01:04.166 --> 00:01:05.900
I will also take good care of my children

36
00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.066
I would never take my children as my career

37
00:01:08.066 --> 00:01:10.000
Springboard doesn't need your sympathy

38
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.366
Talk nonsense to me, that's not what you mean

39
00:01:12.366 --> 00:01:13.666
Why are you one or two?

40
00:01:13.666 --> 00:01:15.566
They want to take my child away from me

41
00:01:15.566 --> 00:01:18.366
You will never be allowed to get out of the car
