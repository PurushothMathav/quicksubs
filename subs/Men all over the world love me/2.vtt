00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.966
I knew you weren't asleep

2
00:00:27.466 --> 00:00:28.566
Where am I now?

3
00:00:28.766 --> 00:00:30.200
Why am I wearing a cheongsam?

4
00:00:33.266 --> 00:00:34.666
I finished reading the script

5
00:00:34.866 --> 00:00:37.766
My so-called heroine is not a cannon fodder

6
00:00:38.533 --> 00:00:41.066
I finished the script. I'm done with the play

7
00:00:41.866 --> 00:00:44.833
Could it be that the duo has already started filming?

8
00:00:45.166 --> 00:00:46.500
Why don't I remember

9
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.000
How how

10
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.300
Don't run

11
00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.066
Master An, you are here

12
00:00:54.066 --> 00:00:55.933
The best location has been reserved for you

13
00:00:55.933 --> 00:00:57.200
How how

14
00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:09.466
Euler, didn't you say

15
00:01:09.466 --> 00:01:11.166
I am the best male protagonist in your heart.

16
00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:14.700
Why is he here?

17
00:01:23.366 --> 00:01:24.166
organ

18
00:01:24.766 --> 00:01:27.366
Where are the other directors on the set?

19
00:01:39.533 --> 00:01:41.833
Later, you were my only heroine.

20
00:01:43.933 --> 00:01:44.733
Leifan

21
00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:46.966
Go over there and have a look, I'll check it out for me

22
00:01:46.966 --> 00:01:48.233
Don't let that kid get away
