00:00:11.366 --> 00:00:12.166
Oran

2
00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.400
Will you marry Rachel?

3
00:00:14.533 --> 00:00:16.233
No matter health or disease

4
00:00:19.566 --> 00:00:21.100
Rich or poor

5
00:00:24.366 --> 00:00:26.266
Where are you from?

6
00:00:31.933 --> 00:00:33.000
Then you promise me first

7
00:00:33.466 --> 00:00:35.100
If one day I am gone

8
00:00:35.666 --> 00:00:37.166
You have to take care of yourself

9
00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:40.066
You will say you will

10
00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:44.266
I would.

11
00:00:54.466 --> 00:00:56.766
Hey wait I have something for you

12
00:00:56.766 --> 00:00:57.700
Close your eyes.

13
00:00:58.733 --> 00:00:59.533
OK

14
00:01:18.466 --> 00:01:19.800
Wake up, Euler

15
00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:23.866
Hahahahaha

16
00:01:25.733 --> 00:01:26.533
Lei Fan

17
00:01:26.933 --> 00:01:28.400
You promised me.

18
00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:30.433
Take care of yourself

19
00:01:30.666 --> 00:01:32.300
Only I can replace you.

20
00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.166
To change the outcome

21
00:01:34.533 --> 00:01:36.800
I know how important he is to you.

22
00:01:36.933 --> 00:01:38.433
So I'll help you.

23
00:01:39.066 --> 00:01:40.300
It's fixed.

24
00:01:40.966 --> 00:01:43.166
Go wait

25
00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:44.800
I have something for you too

26
00:01:45.066 --> 00:01:46.733
Why did you burn out that skateboard?

27
00:01:46.733 --> 00:01:48.800
Can't you just pick it up and buy another piece?

28
00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.700
It was the first thing I stole when I was a kid

29
00:01:50.966 --> 00:01:52.633
I just kept it around.

30
00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:54.633
Actually, you don't have to answer

31
00:01:54.733 --> 00:01:55.866
I can also not be the helper

32
00:01:55.866 --> 00:01:56.300
We go far

33
00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:58.100
I tell you to leave this place of right and wrong

34
00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.200
Oh, are you willing to marry Lei Fan as your wife?

35
00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.166
I would.

36
00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:10.266
crazy
