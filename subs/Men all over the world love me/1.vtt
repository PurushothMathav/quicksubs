00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.900
I don't deserve this from you

2
00:00:03.133 --> 00:00:05.100
You are the most important person to me

3
00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:08.066
See if you two can make eye contact?

4
00:00:08.066 --> 00:00:09.400
Fuse in the feelings a little more?

5
00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:10.933
He's going to wash for you

6
00:00:10.933 --> 00:00:13.100
Do you two have post-renal sincerity now?

7
00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:14.933
I see why you both have kidneys in your eyes

8
00:00:14.933 --> 00:00:15.933
Kidney pride?

9
00:00:15.933 --> 00:00:17.300
Hey, let's do it again, okay?

10
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:18.100
Do it again.

11
00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:23.600
I finished reading the script

12
00:00:23.933 --> 00:00:26.966
It seems that both men love me

13
00:00:26.966 --> 00:00:28.400
But in fact

14
00:00:28.466 --> 00:00:31.300
My so-called heroine is a fat gray

15
00:00:31.533 --> 00:00:34.466
Oh, Miss, you are the best

16
00:00:34.666 --> 00:00:35.500
Ouch oops

17
00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.833
Drink some water to calm down

18
00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:42.866
I'm going to talk to them.

19
00:00:42.866 --> 00:00:43.733
Wait for me.

20
00:00:43.733 --> 00:00:45.000
I warn you

21
00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:46.133
Stay away from Euler

22
00:00:46.133 --> 00:00:47.600
The person Euler likes is me

23
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.433
No, where did you get that confidence?

24
00:00:50.266 --> 00:00:51.366
If you hadn't stepped in

25
00:00:51.366 --> 00:00:52.666
Will Euler look at you?

26
00:00:52.666 --> 00:00:55.166
I'm Hula, wait for me

27
00:01:04.666 --> 00:01:06.466
I'm not doing this play

28
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.466
Miss Tiger Wolf Oleo

29
00:01:10.733 --> 00:01:12.100
You have to think clearly

30
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.966
Breaking the contract requires compensation.

31
00:01:15.866 --> 00:01:18.300
I, Euler, never give too much to anyone

32
00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.966
What's more, I haven't signed the contract for this play yet

33
00:01:23.933 --> 00:01:25.966
Euler, didn't you say

34
00:01:25.966 --> 00:01:27.866
I am the best male protagonist in your heart.

35
00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.833
Euler, you are my only heroine.

36
00:01:31.566 --> 00:01:33.800
Why is my head so dizzy?

37
00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.633
Euler Euler Euler
