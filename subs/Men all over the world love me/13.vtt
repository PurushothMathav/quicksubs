1
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.466
I'm going to win the number one song.

2
00:00:11.466 --> 00:00:13.100
How about some people?

3
00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:15.333
I can only be a sparrow for the rest of my life

4
00:00:15.333 --> 00:00:17.266
overreach

5
00:00:21.933 --> 00:00:23.666
That's not the woman.

6
00:00:23.666 --> 00:00:26.066
You have to be self-aware, otherwise

7
00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.433
It's just that the east is poor

8
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.900
Isn't this OSCE's costume?

9
00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:47.600
Sleepless

10
00:00:51.966 --> 00:00:53.666
You settle down young master

11
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.266
I couldn't even afford a ticket.

12
00:00:55.266 --> 00:00:57.600
You can't afford a ticket for a red envelope, Thor.

13
00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.500
And now, Miss Golla.
