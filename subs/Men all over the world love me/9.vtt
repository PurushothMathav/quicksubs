00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:06.000
Master An proposes to a mysterious woman

2
00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:08.366
This woman turned out to be Miss Wu

3
00:00:16.666 --> 00:00:20.300
Ouch, isn't this the eldest young lady who settled down?

4
00:00:21.366 --> 00:00:23.400
Seducing Master An to succeed

5
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.500
The means are really not simple

6
00:00:26.333 --> 00:00:27.700
How about some people?

7
00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:29.300
Even if the means are exhausted

8
00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:33.600
Pan Dasheng didn't even look at him, oops

9
00:00:36.166 --> 00:00:37.700
As long as you promise to be with me

10
00:00:37.866 --> 00:00:39.466
I immediately ended my engagement with Shu Xin

11
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:40.966
Will you marry me?

12
00:00:46.733 --> 00:00:47.366
It's over. It's over.

13
00:00:47.366 --> 00:00:48.366
Here comes the trouble again

14
00:00:48.366 --> 00:00:50.133
Tomorrow night at Paramount.

15
00:00:50.133 --> 00:00:52.666
I'm going to have an engagement ceremony with Master An

16
00:00:52.666 --> 00:00:56.666
Miss Ou will be invited to dress up at that time.

17
00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:00.900
I will still miss you

18
00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.066
Hey, a sparrow is a sparrow.

19
00:01:04.066 --> 00:01:07.266
Even if you fly to the branches, you can't become a phoenix.

20
00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:08.100
Humph

21
00:01:08.733 --> 00:01:10.866
Hum explain to me

22
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.400
Dad, I won't go to Comfort

23
00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.800
If you don't go to comfort, you will be caught out of the house

24
00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.366
See if that dirty girl will still be with you

25
00:01:24.766 --> 00:01:26.133
Thank you for your time.

26
00:01:26.133 --> 00:01:29.266
Invite us to the first fox in Paramount now

27
00:01:29.766 --> 00:01:31.766
Here's a song and dance for everyone

28
00:02:11.466 --> 00:02:13.366
On this special day

29
00:02:13.466 --> 00:02:15.700
Let's play a game to help the fun

30
00:02:15.733 --> 00:02:18.166
I 100,000 buy Euler all night

31
00:02:18.166 --> 00:02:20.100
Who grabbed my bouquet today?

32
00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.766
So who is Miss Ou tonight?

33
00:02:23.733 --> 00:02:24.766
Don't go too far.

34
00:02:24.766 --> 00:02:26.866
Let go. You're hurting me

35
00:02:30.533 --> 00:02:32.166
I will never marry you if I die

36
00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:39.866
Run! Run!
