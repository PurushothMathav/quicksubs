1
00:00:02.933 --> 00:00:04.600
Death has been set back

2
00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:06.633
But why did I end up dead?

3
00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:08.266
How can I get back?

4
00:00:08.266 --> 00:00:10.466
The girl is not from the world, is she?

5
00:00:14.366 --> 00:00:15.200
director

6
00:00:17.666 --> 00:00:19.833
I saw the girl's sad face

7
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.666
Since it can't be solved

8
00:00:21.666 --> 00:00:24.233
Why don't you count the hexagrams?

9
00:00:30.066 --> 00:00:31.666
If you grow melons, you will get melons.

10
00:00:31.666 --> 00:00:33.466
If you grow beans, you must get beans.

11
00:00:33.466 --> 00:00:35.400
Everything has a cause and effect

12
00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.666
Everybody on the Internet.

13
00:00:38.166 --> 00:00:39.500
Please also express

14
00:00:41.566 --> 00:00:43.433
Cause follows effect.

15
00:00:43.466 --> 00:00:47.000
Think about your cause

16
00:00:47.333 --> 00:00:49.466
Is this all because I was drugged?

17
00:00:49.466 --> 00:00:51.033
The murderer must be found

18
00:00:53.466 --> 00:00:54.566
Could it be that

19
00:01:08.466 --> 00:01:10.233
I'm not doing this play

20
00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.200
Miss Gulaolao

21
00:01:14.566 --> 00:01:16.000
You have to think clearly

22
00:01:16.066 --> 00:01:18.800
Breaking the contract requires compensation.

23
00:01:19.666 --> 00:01:22.166
I, Euler, never give anything to anyone

24
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.866
What's more, I haven't signed the contract for this play yet

25
00:01:27.666 --> 00:01:28.466
Euler

26
00:01:29.566 --> 00:01:30.666
Didn't you say

27
00:01:30.666 --> 00:01:32.233
I am the best actor in your heart

28
00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.566
Euler, you are my only heroine.

29
00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.433
Why is my head so dizzy?

30
00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.200
Euler Euler Euler

31
00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:48.900
The murderer must be found

32
00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:51.700
