1
00:00:00.733 --> 00:00:02.266
The murderer must be found

2
00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:05.100
To get back into the real script

3
00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:21.033
Cover it

4
00:00:23.166 --> 00:00:24.233
So hot

5
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:26.600
I am

6
00:00:27.466 --> 00:00:28.566
What's up?

7
00:00:30.966 --> 00:00:33.566
What's wrong with me?

8
00:00:33.566 --> 00:00:34.433
No way.

9
00:00:34.966 --> 00:00:36.033
No.

10
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:40.800
Upwind

11
00:00:45.933 --> 00:00:48.200
Later, you were my only heroine.

12
00:00:50.133 --> 00:00:51.400
Why did the Overseer save you?

13
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.066
What is your relationship?

14
00:00:53.066 --> 00:00:54.133
What do you think it is?

15
00:00:54.133 --> 00:00:55.800
I don't care what your relationship is

16
00:00:55.933 --> 00:00:57.900
You can only be my Revan's woman

17
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.166
I can only rely on myself in this world

18
00:01:22.933 --> 00:01:27.000
If the journey is missed, it is a compromise

19
00:01:34.666 --> 00:01:38.200
Reach yourself with gentle emotions

20
00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:39.666
Can't write memories
