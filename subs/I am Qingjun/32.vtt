00:00:02.466 --> 00:00:04.433
Learn about chickens for decades

2
00:00:05.266 --> 00:00:09.500
It bounces back, it's all over, we're all over

3
00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:11.966
Humph what a rebel!

4
00:00:11.966 --> 00:00:13.766
It's all your fault

5
00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:16.300
Yes, absolutely not.

6
00:00:16.933 --> 00:00:18.633
How could he be alert?

7
00:00:18.966 --> 00:00:20.466
The first time he came out to punish

8
00:00:20.733 --> 00:00:23.600
There is absolutely no way he can execute the army against Dad

9
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.200
You are scam

10
00:00:25.466 --> 00:00:29.166
You choose to find someone to deliberately call and deceive a man

11
00:00:30.366 --> 00:00:32.366
Ouch, how dare you be stubborn

12
00:00:32.466 --> 00:00:33.400
Dear little masters

13
00:00:34.166 --> 00:00:35.233
Don't worry

14
00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:36.766
What you and I see

15
00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.966
Must be in the mood to call the police

16
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:41.766
What do you mean?

17
00:00:41.766 --> 00:00:44.633
This person is a weight loss lady

18
00:00:44.666 --> 00:00:45.766
No money, no power

19
00:00:45.766 --> 00:00:48.000
It can never be a supreme success

20
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.166
This beast is right

21
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.500
He can't be the police officer's business

22
00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:54.800
You could never have been him

23
00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.766
It must have been a coincidence

24
00:00:57.133 --> 00:00:59.600
In my opinion, it may not be possible

25
00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.000
It's Jiu Ye's warning

26
00:01:02.166 --> 00:01:05.566
Jiu Ye just called me personally and asked me to handle the matter.

27
00:01:05.666 --> 00:01:07.000
But it took so long

28
00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.433
So I made Jiu Ye angry

29
00:01:09.466 --> 00:01:11.633
Yes, yes, yes, it must be so.

30
00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.233
Without your ability

31
00:01:13.666 --> 00:01:16.766
Can get past this person to attack our three major families

32
00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:19.800
People are still like this

33
00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:24.000
It was just a coincidence to hear this ahead

34
00:01:24.166 --> 00:01:24.966
coincidentally

35
00:01:25.566 --> 00:01:28.066
Are you pig heads?

36
00:01:28.066 --> 00:01:29.566
That being the case

37
00:01:29.566 --> 00:01:32.000
There is no chance of redemption in all this

38
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.466
As long as we take him down and hand him over to Lord Xuanque

39
00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.200
Let him talk to the ninth father, okay?

40
00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.800
Then the problem is solved

41
00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.400
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that guy

42
00:01:43.566 --> 00:01:45.466
Wait a minute, Lord Xuanque

43
00:01:46.266 --> 00:01:48.966
You begged me to save you, you were wrong.

44
00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:51.766
You are also for the sake of you being my brother

45
00:01:51.766 --> 00:01:53.200
I can forgive you again.

46
00:01:53.766 --> 00:01:55.966
But they are good

47
00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.566
You can continue.

48
00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.200
After all, the time left for you

49
00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:02.400
Me.

50
00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:03.600
Understand you

51
00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.066
This means

52
00:02:05.166 --> 00:02:06.533
I'll show you now

53
00:02:06.533 --> 00:02:08.133
What is true despair?

54
00:02:08.133 --> 00:02:10.266
Somebody grab me and break my limbs

55
00:02:10.266 --> 00:02:11.766
It's going to be a mess with the whole district

56
00:02:11.766 --> 00:02:13.166
I see who dares
