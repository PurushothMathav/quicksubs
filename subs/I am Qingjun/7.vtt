00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:03.166
That's how you talk to mom

2
00:00:03.866 --> 00:00:05.233
It's okay. It's okay.

3
00:00:05.733 --> 00:00:07.633
Dear dad, what do you do?

4
00:00:07.766 --> 00:00:10.066
Mom, you can't let him go like this anymore

5
00:00:10.066 --> 00:00:11.666
Look what he has become now

6
00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:13.200
If you get used to him again

7
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.466
He knew I was in the wrong place.

8
00:00:14.466 --> 00:00:15.266
inspire

9
00:00:16.133 --> 00:00:18.366
You really think of yourself as my brother

10
00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.200
You are just a wild one picked up by our family

11
00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.700
The child is best left to arch himself

12
00:00:23.066 --> 00:00:26.266
Today is the day of my engagement party

13
00:00:28.266 --> 00:00:29.766
So ugly

14
00:00:30.933 --> 00:00:31.733
middle army

15
00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:33.733
How did that happen?

16
00:00:33.733 --> 00:00:36.066
I also called the security guard up. It's alright

17
00:00:36.166 --> 00:00:37.733
Two poor relatives came to make trouble

18
00:00:37.733 --> 00:00:39.266
I'll kick them out right now

19
00:00:39.266 --> 00:00:40.700
Don't mind

20
00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:41.900
Keep drinking

21
00:00:41.966 --> 00:00:43.000
Please take the street

22
00:00:43.866 --> 00:00:46.133
Hmph, you are developed now

23
00:00:46.133 --> 00:00:47.600
Think we are poor relatives

24
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.433
I think you forgot that you would quit school for fighting back then

25
00:00:51.466 --> 00:00:53.400
Poor relatives in your mouth

26
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.466
The mother who gave birth to you and raised you knelt down to the leader

27
00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.400
Ask for a chance to go to school for you

28
00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.100
If you limit the height, you will be beaten again.

29
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.766
I came to pay you back by moving bricks and working part-time.

30
00:01:04.933 --> 00:01:07.233
Yo, what's the matter, Director Qin?

31
00:01:07.466 --> 00:01:09.900
I didn't expect there to be such a dark history

32
00:01:10.066 --> 00:01:10.866
Please put

33
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.766
Stop this moral kidnapping me

34
00:01:13.966 --> 00:01:15.900
You did all this voluntarily, didn't you?

35
00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:17.200
Did I make you do that?

36
00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:18.900
Did I ask you to do that?

37
00:01:19.266 --> 00:01:21.666
Besides, you are just being killed by your own father

38
00:01:21.666 --> 00:01:23.433
Wild child lost by mother

39
00:01:23.466 --> 00:01:26.666
Over the years, you have eaten my house and used my house

40
00:01:26.666 --> 00:01:28.066
Pay me back

41
00:01:28.466 --> 00:01:30.100
Shouldn't that be?

42
00:01:30.333 --> 00:01:33.233
Relative, he is your brother

43
00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.233
How can you talk like that?

44
00:01:35.466 --> 00:01:37.266
Brother, he also deserves it.

45
00:01:38.266 --> 00:01:40.500
You look like that dead old man

46
00:01:40.533 --> 00:01:42.200
What's wrong with your brain?

47
00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:43.700
We haven't married this yet.

48
00:01:44.166 --> 00:01:46.400
What you see is more important than your baby

49
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.066
What are you doing

50
00:01:48.066 --> 00:01:49.166
Do it!

51
00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:50.700
See who dares
