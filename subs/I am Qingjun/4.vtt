00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.500
You are a bachelor and you have shit for me

2
00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:04.200
Can you give me money if you have the ability?

3
00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:05.533
At least get to know each other

4
00:00:05.533 --> 00:00:07.800
I won't say anything else ugly

5
00:00:07.966 --> 00:00:09.366
From today onwards

6
00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:10.300
You wait for me.

7
00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:11.866
You are learning a class

8
00:00:12.566 --> 00:00:13.566
Take care of yourself

9
00:00:22.566 --> 00:00:23.800
Years of love

10
00:00:24.333 --> 00:00:25.900
So that's it.

11
00:00:27.533 --> 00:00:28.333
Bar

12
00:00:29.466 --> 00:00:30.866
I still don't see it clearly

13
00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.900
Mom

14
00:00:39.333 --> 00:00:41.400
Ok I'll go right now

15
00:00:44.066 --> 00:00:47.400
Golden is the life of our prisoners these years

16
00:00:47.766 --> 00:00:48.900
What about this house?

17
00:00:49.133 --> 00:00:51.000
Dad, didn't we agree?

18
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.366
Leave the house to my brother

19
00:00:52.766 --> 00:00:53.866
Don't say another word.

20
00:00:53.866 --> 00:00:55.100
If it weren't for your uncle

21
00:00:55.366 --> 00:00:56.933
I'm starving to death on the streets

22
00:00:56.933 --> 00:00:58.900
If your brother were as sensible as you

23
00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:00.666
I'm cruel

24
00:01:08.933 --> 00:01:10.833
How about congratulations and coming back?

25
00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:14.300
Why are you here?

26
00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.466
Today is your big day

27
00:01:16.466 --> 00:01:17.900
You just came back

28
00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.266
We just wanted to celebrate with you together.

29
00:01:20.266 --> 00:01:22.266
Yeah, long time no see.

30
00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:23.966
So I got married.

31
00:01:25.133 --> 00:01:26.466
Are you in love?

32
00:01:26.766 --> 00:01:27.966
Come over quickly
