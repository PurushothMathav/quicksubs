00:00:01.133 --> 00:00:01.933
Li Zhaolin

2
00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:05.433
You bully men and women to show your beauty

3
00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:07.600
He is worthy of others to take the bitter and cold land

4
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.200
The two people in the company are assigned their positions to the world

5
00:00:12.566 --> 00:00:14.033
I don't want

6
00:00:14.066 --> 00:00:17.433
Sister, save my sister, I don't want it.

7
00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:20.666
You are the Qing army

8
00:00:21.766 --> 00:00:23.100
You are the Qing army

9
00:00:25.166 --> 00:00:26.700
So you are the Qing army

10
00:00:27.966 --> 00:00:30.766
You didn't say it was me.

11
00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:34.200
I can't

12
00:00:39.566 --> 00:00:40.366
Cuihua

13
00:00:43.966 --> 00:00:47.033
You've been lying to me

14
00:00:47.866 --> 00:00:49.366
You've been lying to me

15
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.966
It's you who keeps saying you're helping me

16
00:00:53.066 --> 00:00:53.900
actually

17
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.000
Actually, you've been watching my jokes

18
00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.366
You think of me as a pig, don't you?

19
00:01:02.366 --> 00:01:03.966
You're wrong again.

20
00:01:04.133 --> 00:01:05.800
I never thought about it that way.

21
00:01:06.266 --> 00:01:07.300
Below Today

22
00:01:07.966 --> 00:01:09.866
It's your fault

23
00:01:09.866 --> 00:01:11.166
blame yourself

24
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.633
A word from you

25
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.033
Deny all my efforts

26
00:01:21.933 --> 00:01:23.500
It shouldn't be like this

27
00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:24.966
It shouldn't be like this

28
00:01:24.966 --> 00:01:28.800
Obviously, it's all on my own

29
00:01:29.366 --> 00:01:31.633
You are all I have always looked down on you

30
00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:33.233
Why?

31
00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.800
Why? What happened?

32
00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.100
You help me.

33
00:01:38.766 --> 00:01:41.400
It was God who arranged for me to save my life

34
00:01:42.966 --> 00:01:43.900
It's god

35
00:01:44.366 --> 00:01:47.033
God is telling me to tell my child

36
00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:57.466
You are indeed more powerful than I thought ahead

37
00:01:57.466 --> 00:01:58.833
I was not wrong about you.

38
00:01:58.866 --> 00:02:00.733
I thought you were extraordinary

39
00:02:00.733 --> 00:02:02.033
It's regal.

40
00:02:02.133 --> 00:02:03.200
Ten Days of Chivalry

41
00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.633
Will be able to send the dragon to sea

42
00:02:04.766 --> 00:02:06.100
Unlike this Qin Ming

43
00:02:06.333 --> 00:02:08.166
After so many years, he is still a small manager

44
00:02:08.166 --> 00:02:09.766
So unpromising

45
00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:12.833
Do you believe I'll beat you to death?
