00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:02.900
Get out get out get out

2
00:00:04.266 --> 00:00:08.200
You, a bunch of ignorant idiots

3
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:10.000
You want to drive me away?

4
00:00:10.466 --> 00:00:11.766
What qualifications do you have?

5
00:00:11.766 --> 00:00:14.466
Qin Feng, you are now the land of Chinese history

6
00:00:14.533 --> 00:00:16.800
Don't you have a shred of shame?

7
00:00:16.933 --> 00:00:18.133
Don't stay here

8
00:00:18.133 --> 00:00:19.966
Don't do it, you won't see it

9
00:00:19.966 --> 00:00:22.466
Miss Cheng has an invitation to the ivy party in her hand

10
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.766
So you want to get back together with him

11
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.466
Hahahaha

12
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.033
He also wants to beg me to get back together

13
00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:31.466
Just a dream

14
00:00:31.466 --> 00:00:35.233
Well, that's exactly the name of my little brother

15
00:00:35.666 --> 00:00:37.533
Okay, okay.

16
00:00:37.533 --> 00:00:39.100
Stop pretending here

17
00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:40.700
Xuan Que is not here

18
00:00:40.733 --> 00:00:42.633
No one can support you

19
00:00:42.766 --> 00:00:45.200
You either get out now

20
00:00:45.266 --> 00:00:48.700
Or wait for the ninth master to come and beat you to death here

21
00:00:48.866 --> 00:00:49.666
Humph

22
00:00:49.966 --> 00:00:54.366
You are so sober and accompany Jiu Ye to do something to me

23
00:00:54.366 --> 00:00:55.200
Please send Ao.

24
00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.400
This is the ivy feast

25
00:00:57.666 --> 00:00:59.766
Jiu Ye is the closest of the Qing army

26
00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.933
Since you dare to call Ninth Master by name

27
00:01:01.933 --> 00:01:03.233
Who gave you the courage?

28
00:01:03.333 --> 00:01:05.100
You kneel here for me now

29
00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.900
For what you just said

30
00:01:07.266 --> 00:01:08.433
Jiu Ye apologizes

31
00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:10.533
Let me kneel

32
00:01:10.533 --> 00:01:11.333
Why is that?

33
00:01:11.966 --> 00:01:15.100
Even if Pei Jiuling is standing here

34
00:01:15.266 --> 00:01:17.166
Don't dare to tell me that

35
00:01:18.533 --> 00:01:19.333
everyone

36
00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:23.400
Everyone has seen this son's words and deeds

37
00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.400
I suspect he's trying to make a fuss about the Ivy Festival

38
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.066
To ruin the party

39
00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:30.466
Yellow mouth children

40
00:01:30.733 --> 00:01:32.066
overreach

41
00:01:32.733 --> 00:01:33.566
Qin Feng

42
00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.266
Everyone here today is nobler than you

43
00:01:37.666 --> 00:01:41.000
I know you have grievances and want to vent

44
00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.366
But this is not the occasion

45
00:01:43.566 --> 00:01:46.966
Because you're killing yourself.

46
00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:50.166
Dare to listen and dare to talk in front of the Dai people

47
00:01:50.333 --> 00:01:53.500
Qin Feng, you are in the tomb of consciousness

48
00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:59.066
Today, the city is full of authoritative people

49
00:01:59.333 --> 00:02:00.166
China today

50
00:02:00.733 --> 00:02:01.700
I have everything

51
00:02:02.333 --> 00:02:03.766
If I don't come

52
00:02:03.766 --> 00:02:07.400
They're not even qualified to work.
