1
00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:00.966
Qianjun

2
00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:06.433
I'm your sister.

3
00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:08.633
I am not I am not

4
00:00:09.133 --> 00:00:10.400
He is Qianjun

5
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.500
But you look down on it now

6
00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:18.166
Seven people Seven people are my greatest admiration for the Qing army

7
00:00:18.333 --> 00:00:20.833
He is the Great Xia of Force

8
00:00:21.366 --> 00:00:22.766
supreme

9
00:00:23.133 --> 00:00:24.566
King over the world

10
00:00:24.866 --> 00:00:26.633
The unparalleled Qing army at the beginning

11
00:00:26.766 --> 00:00:30.066
Please be gentle when your subordinates have no north to protect you.

12
00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.200
It's okay to get up

13
00:00:33.566 --> 00:00:34.633
If you had come earlier

14
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.333
How can I see the ugliness of Baitu?

15
00:00:37.333 --> 00:00:40.066
How can you see the domineering of the digital gods of war?

16
00:00:40.466 --> 00:00:43.633
How can I see this Beijing king?

17
00:00:43.933 --> 00:00:45.400
German coordination

18
00:00:46.466 --> 00:00:49.100
Qingba, you are really Qingjun

19
00:00:49.166 --> 00:00:50.466
When did I lie to you?

20
00:00:50.733 --> 00:00:53.233
I told you to let the Tang family officials recover their integrity

21
00:00:53.266 --> 00:00:55.000
Bring you back to the throne of the god of war

22
00:00:55.066 --> 00:00:57.266
But when I say a word, no

23
00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:59.900
Qin Fang, you can't be the Qing army

24
00:01:04.733 --> 00:01:07.433
This is the Qing army

25
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.866
Give me an order from the king himself

26
00:01:09.933 --> 00:01:11.266
If you were the Qing army

27
00:01:11.266 --> 00:01:13.300
Why didn't you tell me?

28
00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:15.000
Why didn't I tell you?

29
00:01:15.266 --> 00:01:16.700
I'm afraid it will hurt your self-esteem

30
00:01:17.366 --> 00:01:19.700
May you grow as you have repeatedly emphasized today

31
00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.166
I did it to protect my pride

32
00:01:21.166 --> 00:01:22.866
Just talking nonsense here

33
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.033
In fact, it is you who feel inferior to yourself

34
00:01:26.533 --> 00:01:27.833
You know you're not strong enough

35
00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.266
It's not a coincidence

36
00:01:29.366 --> 00:01:31.666
The position of God of War is caused by luck

37
00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.266
So you've been trembling

38
00:01:34.266 --> 00:01:37.066
Use your arrogance to hide your inner inferiority

39
00:01:37.133 --> 00:01:37.866
That's not true.

40
00:01:37.866 --> 00:01:39.600
You shut up, I've been

41
00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.466
In return for your kindness to me

42
00:01:41.466 --> 00:01:42.833
And an apology for breaking up the marriage

43
00:01:42.966 --> 00:01:45.300
I single-handedly promoted you to victory

44
00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.966
Many times I secretly wish you to win the battle

45
00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.200
I thought you would grow

46
00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:52.500
pity

47
00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.766
You have failed my expectations of you.

48
00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:56.766
No military sail

49
00:01:57.133 --> 00:01:59.866
No I don't have where I am today

50
00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:01.966
All on my own strength

51
00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:03.266
It has nothing to do with you.

52
00:02:03.333 --> 00:02:04.766
No, you.

53
00:02:04.866 --> 00:02:06.766
You are not a police station at all

54
00:02:06.766 --> 00:02:07.766
Yan'an God of War

55
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.066
Abuse of heavy punches

56
00:02:09.466 --> 00:02:10.366
Retake troops

57
00:02:10.366 --> 00:02:11.200
Look at me

58
00:02:11.333 --> 00:02:13.000
Take back the seat of the god of war

59
00:02:13.066 --> 00:02:14.300
Descended nine levels in a row

60
00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.500
Descended to Beijing

61
00:02:15.766 --> 00:02:17.166
Clap your hands and go out
