00:00:01.466 --> 00:00:03.400
It's not good to follow you

2
00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:04.300
demotion

3
00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:05.766
Go back and reflect on it for me

4
00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:06.900
Thank you ma'am

5
00:00:06.933 --> 00:00:07.866
Thank you ma'am

6
00:00:07.866 --> 00:00:08.866
Go away

7
00:00:08.933 --> 00:00:10.800
Yes, yes!

8
00:00:13.133 --> 00:00:15.600
Miss Cao can't be fired.

9
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.466
I beg you not to fire me, okay?

10
00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.833
If the people out there are experts on my team

11
00:00:20.366 --> 00:00:21.766
Then I'm very tempting

12
00:00:21.766 --> 00:00:23.900
Tell your mother to apologize to me

13
00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:25.466
I'll go and apologize

14
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.233
Sorry.

15
00:00:27.466 --> 00:00:28.600
Sorry brother

16
00:00:28.733 --> 00:00:30.866
Please help us, Miss Tang, make a wish

17
00:00:30.866 --> 00:00:31.666
All right.

18
00:00:32.733 --> 00:00:35.066
Brother, I was wrong.

19
00:00:35.166 --> 00:00:36.933
Brother, wait for me to meet brother.

20
00:00:36.933 --> 00:00:39.033
I was wrong, look, I apologize to you.

21
00:00:39.066 --> 00:00:41.433
Did you hear that Miss Tang let me go this time?

22
00:00:43.933 --> 00:00:45.800
Mom, it's not easy to give birth to you and raise you

23
00:00:45.933 --> 00:00:47.600
But what did you do to her?

24
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.700
You ask me to forgive you now

25
00:00:50.066 --> 00:00:51.900
Some mistakes can be forgiven

26
00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.033
Some mistakes are unforgivable

27
00:00:57.466 --> 00:00:59.600
Brother, don't you like Chen Feifei?

28
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:00.600
I'll give it to you

29
00:01:01.066 --> 00:01:02.766
As long as you let Miss Tang let me go this time

30
00:01:02.766 --> 00:01:03.533
Don't fire me

31
00:01:03.533 --> 00:01:05.000
I will do whatever you ask me to do

32
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.300
I've never seen someone as shameless as you

33
00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.700
Their own women beat them with their hands

34
00:01:12.133 --> 00:01:12.933
No.

35
00:01:13.466 --> 00:01:16.433
Mother, you bastard, get out

36
00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:18.166
From Now On

37
00:01:18.166 --> 00:01:20.466
Don't make it hard for me to see you two again

38
00:01:20.466 --> 00:01:21.533
He doesn't want you.

39
00:01:21.533 --> 00:01:22.700
You can't fire me

40
00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:24.633
In your words

41
00:01:24.733 --> 00:01:27.133
You and I are not of the same class

42
00:01:27.133 --> 00:01:29.300
You are just a wage earner in Tangjiang

43
00:01:29.366 --> 00:01:30.866
Why can't I be fired?

44
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.366
Why is there a backstage?

45
00:01:33.866 --> 00:01:36.833
The three major families
