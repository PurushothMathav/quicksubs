00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:01.400
Did I hear it right?

2
00:00:01.666 --> 00:00:03.333
Yanchengshen says your brand

3
00:00:03.333 --> 00:00:05.133
It was really him who was violated

4
00:00:05.133 --> 00:00:07.366
Do they really know each other?

5
00:00:07.366 --> 00:00:09.266
Hey, what kind of relationship is this?

6
00:00:09.266 --> 00:00:11.800
Only then will the invitation letter be sent out?

7
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:13.600
Youen

8
00:00:18.666 --> 00:00:20.366
Sister, what are you talking about?

9
00:00:20.366 --> 00:00:21.700
Are you kidding me?

10
00:00:21.933 --> 00:00:23.266
Let this waste go

11
00:00:23.266 --> 00:00:25.166
It is also worthy of you to send him an invitation letter.

12
00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:27.300
Yes, Lawyer Ye

13
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.666
Did you make a mistake?

14
00:00:30.266 --> 00:00:31.233
This invitation

15
00:00:31.733 --> 00:00:33.200
It was indeed given by me.

16
00:00:37.733 --> 00:00:40.633
I haven't seen you in a few years. What I expected is really good

17
00:00:41.966 --> 00:00:42.766
Golden Phoenix

18
00:00:43.133 --> 00:00:44.400
Your appearance

19
00:00:44.733 --> 00:00:45.966
Nothing has changed

20
00:00:45.966 --> 00:00:47.366
Still the same

21
00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:49.400
What's it like?

22
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.400
Defiant and arrogant

23
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:52.700
It's a punch.

24
00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.433
It's okay, Jinbao

25
00:00:59.566 --> 00:01:01.866
You don't think I gave you this invitation

26
00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:03.700
Is ruthless against you

27
00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.066
Obviously an incompetent waste

28
00:01:06.066 --> 00:01:08.566
Always pretending to be on top

29
00:01:08.566 --> 00:01:09.700
Master everything

30
00:01:09.966 --> 00:01:12.700
That's what makes people sick

31
00:01:13.666 --> 00:01:18.033
It seems that you are here to humiliate me today

32
00:01:18.566 --> 00:01:19.866
You know it

33
00:01:19.866 --> 00:01:22.700
What do you think I mean by sending you this invitation?

34
00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.066
I'll let you know.

35
00:01:24.066 --> 00:01:27.600
Let you see with your own eyes the glorious moment when I was canonized

36
00:01:28.666 --> 00:01:29.800
You make you understand

37
00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:31.366
The gap between you and me

38
00:01:31.766 --> 00:01:34.266
It is a red envelope that can never be crossed.
