00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:02.900
Hurry up, where did he come from?

2
00:00:04.466 --> 00:00:05.600
At dawn.

3
00:00:06.133 --> 00:00:07.566
What does that mean?

4
00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:08.966
What do you mean?

5
00:00:10.133 --> 00:00:11.266
Look at this business manager

6
00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:12.600
Is there anyone like you two?

7
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:13.366
Ah!

8
00:00:13.366 --> 00:00:15.900
Which of these is not a good thing for the big light?

9
00:00:15.933 --> 00:00:18.200
Look at you two again

10
00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.000
What do you see?

11
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.366
Aren't you ashamed?

12
00:00:22.333 --> 00:00:23.133
No way.

13
00:00:23.933 --> 00:00:26.066
Dad, how can you talk like that?

14
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:28.166
Dogs don't mind poor families, children don't mind ugly mothers

15
00:00:28.466 --> 00:00:29.800
Mom pulled you so hard

16
00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:32.233
Besides, you can't have a request to forget your roots

17
00:00:33.133 --> 00:00:33.966
Your mom apologizes

18
00:00:34.333 --> 00:00:37.000
I'm not wrong to apologize. What am I apologizing for?

19
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:37.700
I ask you

20
00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:38.600
Okay, okay.

21
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.000
Is it bad? We won't go in.

22
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.733
Then we can eat together as a family

23
00:00:43.733 --> 00:00:46.466
Son, today is your big day

24
00:00:46.466 --> 00:00:48.333
Mom has nothing to give you

25
00:00:48.333 --> 00:00:51.400
This house is your dad and I's life savings

26
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:55.433
Who cares about your broken house?

27
00:00:55.733 --> 00:00:57.400
I'm finally getting ahead now

28
00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:58.566
Become a city person

29
00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:00.966
Do you still want me to break the kennel?

30
00:01:01.266 --> 00:01:02.700
I'm using it for you.

31
00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.300
My mom has nothing to offer you

32
00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:08.200
You only have this room, do I want you to give it?

33
00:01:08.366 --> 00:01:10.566
You say it like you can do anything with me

34
00:01:11.066 --> 00:01:12.300
Also called the village head

35
00:01:12.466 --> 00:01:13.800
What do you want?

36
00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.400
Son, what are you doing?

37
00:01:16.733 --> 00:01:18.666
Can your son take you more seriously?
