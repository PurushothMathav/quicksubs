1
00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.100
Let's not meet again

2
00:00:02.266 --> 00:00:03.800
Shanshan's follow-up treatment plan

3
00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:05.566
I will send it to you by email.

4
00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.266
Why would you rather find me?

5
00:00:08.266 --> 00:00:10.266
He said if I don't meet you

6
00:00:10.266 --> 00:00:11.866
Just give me 10 million

7
00:00:12.066 --> 00:00:13.900
How good is this deal?

8
00:00:14.166 --> 00:00:16.200
I'm worth 10 million in your eyes

9
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:17.300
Right.

10
00:00:18.066 --> 00:00:19.500
It's too late to say anything now

11
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.700
I took the money and signed the agreement

12
00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:23.300
I can't break the contract

13
00:00:25.366 --> 00:00:26.166
Hello

14
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:28.300
Hello

15
00:00:31.866 --> 00:00:33.200
Come and drink

16
00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:50.500
Mr. Ning

17
00:00:50.566 --> 00:00:53.100
You still like Mr. Bo, so why reject him?

18
00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.100
What's the use of liking it?

19
00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.733
He can't afford to study with you all these years

20
00:00:58.733 --> 00:01:00.166
She had a baby.

21
00:01:00.666 --> 00:01:02.266
Don't be a good dad

22
00:01:02.266 --> 00:01:05.233
Come to me and pretend that the applicant sets me up

23
00:01:07.866 --> 00:01:10.733
The warehouse will locate your warm location for me immediately.

24
00:01:10.733 --> 00:01:12.433
Immediately
