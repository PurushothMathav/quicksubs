00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:01.733
Why did you push me?

2
00:00:01.733 --> 00:00:03.800
I'm not trying hard.

3
00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:06.233
Mr. Luo, you must give me justice.

4
00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:10.000
Are you here to ask me for guilt?

5
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:10.800
What crime?

6
00:00:11.766 --> 00:00:12.566
I see.

7
00:00:12.666 --> 00:00:14.700
Didn't you see this woman hit me?

8
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.600
I see it, so what?

9
00:00:17.133 --> 00:00:18.900
So this ruthless woman

10
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.366
You can make him do it to you

11
00:00:20.366 --> 00:00:22.300
You should find more women of your own

12
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.033
Besides, what kind of person are you to call him ugly?

13
00:00:27.133 --> 00:00:30.966
I don't understand, do you mean I'm not as good-looking as him?

14
00:00:31.466 --> 00:00:32.666
So ugly

15
00:00:32.933 --> 00:00:34.666
And qualified to be compared to him

16
00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:37.066
I don't believe it.

17
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.266
How could I not be as good-looking as him?

18
00:00:39.333 --> 00:00:40.900
I said he looks better than you.

19
00:00:41.166 --> 00:00:42.766
He just looks better than you.

20
00:00:42.866 --> 00:00:43.933
Vice President

21
00:00:43.933 --> 00:00:46.300
I took advantage of him this time, he is indeed better looking than me

22
00:00:47.466 --> 00:00:48.266
you
