00:00:00.466 --> 00:00:02.200
Kurasuke is also for the good of the children

2
00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:04.933
It would be chilling for you to tell him that.

3
00:00:04.933 --> 00:00:06.533
He asked you to come and you came

4
00:00:06.533 --> 00:00:07.700
Can I not come?

5
00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:09.066
The child is hungry for a meal or two

6
00:00:09.066 --> 00:00:10.100
He's so young.

7
00:00:10.366 --> 00:00:12.033
How can he always starve?

8
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.466
After all, he is your biological daughter after all

9
00:00:14.466 --> 00:00:16.166
Can you treat him with more snacks?

10
00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:17.833
Forget about being busy with work

11
00:00:17.933 --> 00:00:19.700
Get tangled up with other women

12
00:00:19.866 --> 00:00:21.100
Other Women

13
00:00:21.666 --> 00:00:24.400
Luo is always a woman, you know very well

14
00:00:24.566 --> 00:00:25.666
Okay, enough.

15
00:00:25.666 --> 00:00:27.033
I'm going to see Rain Mountain

16
00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:36.233
From then on, the prince and princess were happy

17
00:00:36.466 --> 00:00:38.100
Continue to live together

18
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.066
They will definitely have a better future

19
00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.300
If my daughter were still alive

20
00:00:57.466 --> 00:00:59.966
It should be as old as Shanshan

21
00:01:19.333 --> 00:01:20.866
When will you be back?

22
00:01:20.966 --> 00:01:22.366
Since you just told the story

23
00:01:22.366 --> 00:01:24.000
I have no ill will towards the past

24
00:01:24.266 --> 00:01:25.966
You don't have to spy on me like this
