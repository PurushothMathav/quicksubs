waiter

2
00:00:00.733 --> 00:00:02.733
Please help me get a suit of clothes at random.

3
00:00:02.733 --> 00:00:04.066
Sorry, sorry.

4
00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:05.333
What wasn't intentional?

5
00:00:05.333 --> 00:00:06.866
I think you did it on purpose.

6
00:00:06.866 --> 00:00:08.766
Do you know how much my girlfriend's shoes are worth?

7
00:00:08.766 --> 00:00:10.400
You can't afford to sell you.

8
00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.500
Forget it, this ugly guy

9
00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.566
I guess you don't even know the brand of my shoes.

10
00:00:14.566 --> 00:00:16.433
Just pretend I stepped on dog shit today

11
00:00:16.566 --> 00:00:17.366
This lady

12
00:00:17.533 --> 00:00:19.100
Didn't you brush your teeth in the morning?

13
00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:20.200
What do you mean?

14
00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:20.966
What's that smell?

15
00:00:20.966 --> 00:00:24.066
It stinks, it's really shameless

16
00:00:24.066 --> 00:00:26.333
I was going to let you go

17
00:00:26.333 --> 00:00:28.000
Let's talk about this first

18
00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:30.066
Sure. How do you want to talk?

19
00:00:30.066 --> 00:00:32.600
My girlfriend, these shoes are a limited edition with a big design.

20
00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.033
The shoes are stepped on by you like this.

21
00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:35.466
The shoes are all deformed.

22
00:00:35.466 --> 00:00:36.666
You must compensate today.

23
00:00:36.666 --> 00:00:37.833
I promise you don't want to go

24
00:00:38.466 --> 00:00:39.666
How much are your shoes?

25
00:00:39.666 --> 00:00:40.966
I will compensate you at the market price.

26
00:00:40.966 --> 00:00:42.100
Lest you deny it

27
00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.266
Do you know how much my shoes cost?

28
00:00:44.266 --> 00:00:46.366
You dare to say that you will pay me at the market price.
