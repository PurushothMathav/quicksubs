00:00:00.733 --> 00:00:03.300
300,000 receive a lot of money

2
00:00:03.533 --> 00:00:05.333
How is that possible?

3
00:00:05.333 --> 00:00:07.300
Where did this ugly guy get so much money?

4
00:00:07.366 --> 00:00:08.466
When?

5
00:00:08.466 --> 00:00:10.966
To lose money, you also need to know the source of the money.

6
00:00:10.966 --> 00:00:12.633
How have you been?

7
00:00:12.733 --> 00:00:14.966
Can you take off your shoes now?

8
00:00:15.133 --> 00:00:16.366
What do you mean?

9
00:00:16.533 --> 00:00:17.966
Is that hard to understand?

10
00:00:17.966 --> 00:00:19.666
I spent 300,000 on a pair of shoes

11
00:00:19.666 --> 00:00:21.066
Now he's mine.

12
00:00:21.066 --> 00:00:23.433
Are you not ashamed to continue to dress?

13
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.566
You wore my shoes. What am I wearing?

14
00:00:26.733 --> 00:00:29.200
What you wear is none of my business

15
00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:32.500
People also lost money, why doesn't this woman take off her shoes?

16
00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:33.533
What do you mean?

17
00:00:33.533 --> 00:00:35.566
I pretended to look down on people before

18
00:00:35.566 --> 00:00:37.500
Your face is swollen now

19
00:00:40.866 --> 00:00:41.900
Here you are.

20
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.700
Why did you throw away my shoes?

21
00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:47.733
These are my shoes.

22
00:00:47.733 --> 00:00:49.300
I just paid for it.

23
00:00:49.933 --> 00:00:52.366
I can do whatever I want with my shoes.

24
00:00:52.366 --> 00:00:54.233
Do you still need your consent?
