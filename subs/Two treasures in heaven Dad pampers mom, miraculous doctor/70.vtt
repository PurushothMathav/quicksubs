1
00:00:00.466 --> 00:00:03.433
How did you find me?

2
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.300
Don't worry about this.

3
00:00:05.333 --> 00:00:08.500
My mom has a conflict with Doctor Uncle Yan

4
00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:12.200
I want to join forces with you to help them repair their relationship

5
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:13.700
Do you do it or not?

6
00:00:15.266 --> 00:00:16.833
Smirk, are you asleep?

7
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:26.800
Shanshan, are you asleep?

8
00:00:32.966 --> 00:00:33.766
Shanshan

9
00:00:33.866 --> 00:00:36.033
Can I borrow a way to use your phone?

10
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.100
Then baby go to bed early, good night

11
00:00:45.866 --> 00:00:47.566
How is the wave

12
00:00:48.066 --> 00:00:50.033
Shanshan is asleep, so it is inconvenient to ask again.

13
00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:51.566
The enemy has stopped attacking

14
00:00:51.566 --> 00:00:53.300
The system has been fully restored

15
00:00:53.766 --> 00:00:55.466
Follow-up is checking.
