00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.300
You don't have the right to refuse me, do you?

2
00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:03.800
What do you want to do?

3
00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:05.866
I am a popular flower

4
00:00:05.866 --> 00:00:07.633
I have a in-law family as a backer for me

5
00:00:08.166 --> 00:00:10.766
Clean up a helpless little doctor like you

6
00:00:11.066 --> 00:00:12.166
Easy

7
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.866
Then why don't you send it?

8
00:00:16.533 --> 00:00:18.800
It's not easy to clean you up

9
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.600
But take care of your son

10
00:00:20.933 --> 00:00:22.000
More than enough

11
00:00:23.366 --> 00:00:25.366
Why are you still so mean?

12
00:00:25.866 --> 00:00:27.833
You're welcome. Let's go.

13
00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:34.166
Just say it

14
00:00:34.166 --> 00:00:37.433
I heard that you and the actor have been very close recently

15
00:00:37.566 --> 00:00:39.600
The friend you play is my friend

16
00:00:39.666 --> 00:00:42.633
So I thought I'd get to know you today.

17
00:00:44.533 --> 00:00:45.933
I'd love to know

18
00:00:45.933 --> 00:00:47.500
What is your relationship with the actor?

19
00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.966
I have been by my side all these years

20
00:00:51.066 --> 00:00:54.300
You are the first woman I met at the Hakutodate

21
00:00:55.166 --> 00:00:57.166
Since you've been with her for so many years

22
00:00:57.166 --> 00:00:58.700
Why haven't I married you?

23
00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.900
How are you? Oh, I heard.

24
00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:03.466
We've been in love for a long time

25
00:01:03.466 --> 00:01:05.700
It's hard to get married

26
00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.433
I see your marriage is hanging
