1
00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:03.000
But what you clearly said before was

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.966
The blue folder is handed over to the production.

3
00:00:04.966 --> 00:00:06.866
The black folder is handed over to the second production department.

4
00:00:07.733 --> 00:00:08.733
These are all to be sent to

5
00:00:08.733 --> 00:00:10.566
Clothing samples from different regions

6
00:00:10.733 --> 00:00:13.233
Can I make a mistake as a supervisor?

7
00:00:14.666 --> 00:00:15.600
I testify

8
00:00:16.266 --> 00:00:17.400
What the deputy supervisor said is

9
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.700
Give the black folder to the production one.

10
00:00:19.733 --> 00:00:21.800
The blue folder is handed over to the second production department.

11
00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.666
You must have got it wrong.

12
00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.300
I heard it clearly

13
00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.066
Do something wrong and dare not admit it

14
00:00:28.266 --> 00:00:30.300
I also want to put the blame on the supervisor

15
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.366
I don't even know how you passed the interview

16
00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:34.700
It must be the face

17
00:00:35.333 --> 00:00:37.133
A high school diploma like yours

18
00:00:37.133 --> 00:00:39.033
How can you remember to buy us world-weary?

19
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.700
Don't stab me in the cage then

20
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.466
You want us to wipe your butt?

21
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.766
Hey, it's good to be beautiful.

22
00:00:46.766 --> 00:00:49.533
What you want, go to bed and get it

23
00:00:49.533 --> 00:00:50.800
How are you like us?

24
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:51.666
For static electricity

25
00:00:51.666 --> 00:00:54.466
I don't know how many nights I stayed up working on the design draft

26
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.700
How did I get into the world-weary group in the first place?

27
00:00:57.733 --> 00:00:59.000
Naturally for a resume interview

28
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.266
The entry process is open and transparent

29
00:01:01.266 --> 00:01:02.800
If you have any questions

30
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.366
You can check with personnel.

31
00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:06.266
With your degree

32
00:01:06.266 --> 00:01:08.400
It's just not in the hands of personnel

33
00:01:08.533 --> 00:01:10.700
You even have the audacity to say that from the regular

34
00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.300
Channels come in, you are ridiculous

35
00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.166
That only means

36
00:01:15.166 --> 00:01:17.100
The anorexia group is a group that values individual ability

37
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.766
It's not about qualifications.

38
00:01:18.933 --> 00:01:20.166
I can enter the company

39
00:01:20.166 --> 00:01:22.233
It shows that my ability is recognized by the company.

40
00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:23.966
If you don't believe me

41
00:01:23.966 --> 00:01:24.866
I can share my history

42
00:01:24.866 --> 00:01:26.566
I'll show you the design draft

43
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.200
I am said to be a dozen before today

44
00:01:32.266 --> 00:01:33.600
Just became a supervisor

45
00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.766
I usually see that my brother-in-law is wearing help.

46
00:01:37.166 --> 00:01:37.966
Gu Qingqing

47
00:01:39.166 --> 00:01:41.100
I'm talking to you now about the file.

48
00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.500
Don't change the subject
