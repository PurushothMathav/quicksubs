1
00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:06.666
Gu Nuannuan, come to me quickly

2
00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:13.066
These are my old sketches.

3
00:00:13.133 --> 00:00:14.633
You've been copying me

4
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:17.133
So what?

5
00:00:17.133 --> 00:00:18.400
No one believes you

6
00:00:19.133 --> 00:00:21.666
Gu Qingqing, I urge you to recognize the reality

7
00:00:21.666 --> 00:00:23.166
I've been misanthropic for so many years

8
00:00:23.166 --> 00:00:25.133
You think you can shake my position with one word

9
00:00:25.133 --> 00:00:26.400
Don't daydream

10
00:00:27.566 --> 00:00:28.600
So what?

11
00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.700
In the end, who knows?

12
00:00:31.133 --> 00:00:32.600
We'll see won't we.

13
00:00:38.666 --> 00:00:39.500
Mr. Yan

14
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.800
Thank you for your hard work, everyone is here, everyone is here

15
00:00:46.066 --> 00:00:47.166
What about Gu Qingqing?

16
00:00:48.133 --> 00:00:49.666
Gu Qingqing is suspected of plagiarism

17
00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:51.466
I'm afraid I didn't fall in love

18
00:00:52.066 --> 00:00:52.900
plagiarism

19
00:00:54.966 --> 00:00:55.866
That's not possible.

20
00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:57.500
Mr. Yan

21
00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.700
Although I don't understand why you always favor me like this

22
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:00.600
Protect Gu Qingqing

23
00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.800
But he has touched my bottom line

24
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.466
It has touched the bottom line of the entire design community

25
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.900
If you keep protecting him like this

26
00:01:08.266 --> 00:01:08.700
I think

27
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.033
I'm afraid it will break the heart of the entire design department staff

28
00:01:11.366 --> 00:01:12.533
Mr. Yan, I testify

29
00:01:12.533 --> 00:01:14.866
Gu Qingqing plagiarized Nuannuan's work

30
00:01:14.866 --> 00:01:16.666
Misbehaving people like him

31
00:01:16.666 --> 00:01:18.366
You can't stay in Yan's Group at all

32
00:01:18.366 --> 00:01:19.533
I can also testify

33
00:01:19.533 --> 00:01:20.700
Gu Qingqing's manuscript?

34
00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.166
Just like Sister Nuannuan

35
00:01:22.166 --> 00:01:23.400
Sister Nuannuan's submission time

36
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.000
It's still a day earlier than Gu Qingqing

37
00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:26.100
And me?

38
00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.033
I can also testify

39
00:01:28.766 --> 00:01:31.200
Qingqing's work was completed by me watching him with my own eyes

40
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.633
How is it possible to plagiarize?

41
00:01:32.766 --> 00:01:35.500
Even if it is plagiarized, it is definitely Gu Nianuan's plagiarism.

42
00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.600
Gently, I believe in Gu Qingqing's character

43
00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.300
I'll check this out.

44
00:01:44.166 --> 00:01:46.500
If I can find the true vitality

45
00:01:46.866 --> 00:01:48.766
I will also be severely punished

46
00:01:59.066 --> 00:01:59.866
Hello Qingqing

47
00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:01.700
I went to the door of the Costume of the Century competition

48
00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:02.833
Why didn't I see you?

49
00:02:03.066 --> 00:02:05.233
Actually, you want to come to my game too

50
00:02:05.366 --> 00:02:06.833
See you later. Okay.

51
00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:08.566
Then I'll wait for you at the door.

52
00:02:14.266 --> 00:02:15.833
It's been almost half an hour

53
00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.166
Why haven't you come yet?

54
00:02:20.933 --> 00:02:24.800
Hello, the user you dialed is temporarily unavailable.

55
00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.466
Mr. Ye is turned off

56
00:02:26.466 --> 00:02:27.633
I'll check the surveillance.
