00:00:03.266 --> 00:00:04.166
Don't worry.

2
00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.033
I've already paid for your grandmother's medical bills

3
00:00:08.266 --> 00:00:11.433
In fact, you are really my guardian knight

4
00:00:11.733 --> 00:00:13.133
You not only saved me

5
00:00:13.133 --> 00:00:15.033
He also helped me pay for my grandmother's medical expenses

6
00:00:16.566 --> 00:00:17.400
But

7
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.666
Where did you get so much money?

8
00:00:19.733 --> 00:00:22.166
Grandma's medical expenses cost more than 200,000 yuan

9
00:00:23.366 --> 00:00:26.300
Ah, that's all my savings.

10
00:00:26.666 --> 00:00:28.400
Ah, although my salary is not high

11
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:29.700
But after all these years

12
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:31.833
I can save a 200,000

13
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.600
In fact, don't worry.

14
00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.200
I will definitely return the money to you.

15
00:00:39.133 --> 00:00:40.100
No.

16
00:00:41.333 --> 00:00:44.066
It's just that my salary is not high now.

17
00:00:44.133 --> 00:00:45.700
It may be slower.

18
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:48.400
Hey

19
00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:51.166
I saw your costume design in the apartment

20
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.166
You are obviously so talented

21
00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.833
Why don't you apply for a job as a designer?

22
00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.900
I left college because of something

23
00:00:59.266 --> 00:01:00.566
No company

24
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:01.466
Will want a high school

25
00:01:01.466 --> 00:01:03.400
People with academic qualifications and no work

26
00:01:05.333 --> 00:01:07.000
I just saw it on the Internet.

27
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.666
The design department of the world is hiring people

28
00:01:08.866 --> 00:01:09.966
You have to try

29
00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:11.666
World-weary group

30
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.300
It's the company where the richest man hates the world

31
00:01:16.133 --> 00:01:17.000
Ah!

32
00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:20.766
My degree

33
00:01:21.066 --> 00:01:22.233
Definitely not

34
00:01:23.266 --> 00:01:25.033
How do you know if you don't try?

35
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Ok then I try

36
00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:38.700
Project down two more points

37
00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:39.866
If you don't agree, change it.

38
00:01:40.933 --> 00:01:41.966
Talk to you later

39
00:01:43.466 --> 00:01:44.300
actually

40
00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:47.666
Actually, you know what?

41
00:01:47.666 --> 00:01:49.000
I was accepted to the night market

42
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.600
I never imagined that one day

43
00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:51.900
I can enter the night market group

44
00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:53.266
You know my lucky star.

45
00:01:53.733 --> 00:01:55.133
I knew you could do it.

46
00:01:55.133 --> 00:01:56.633
Come on, I'll take you to the night market

47
00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.766
Actually, why did you bring me here?

48
00:02:01.866 --> 00:02:02.966
Shopping for clothes?

49
00:02:03.366 --> 00:02:05.466
Celebrate your admission to the Night Market Group

50
00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:07.566
Pick whatever you like

51
00:02:16.066 --> 00:02:18.300
It's actually too expensive

52
00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:19.300
Change one.

53
00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.600
I said why does the mall smell poor and sour?

54
00:02:22.933 --> 00:02:24.466
It's you
