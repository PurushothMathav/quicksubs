00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.866
Be careful with a glass of water

2
00:00:03.366 --> 00:00:06.300
Hey, what's going on?

3
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:07.666
reckless

4
00:00:08.333 --> 00:00:09.666
Just a glass of water

5
00:00:09.666 --> 00:00:12.100
Do you need such a big child?

6
00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.433
Am I not afraid that he will get hurt?

7
00:00:14.466 --> 00:00:17.500
Hey, Xiaobao, show your mother if you are hurt?

8
00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.600
It's hot, Xiaobao, come here

9
00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:22.900
Because of injury

10
00:00:24.366 --> 00:00:26.900
Come let daddy see

11
00:00:29.733 --> 00:00:31.100
Why are you so busy?

12
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.400
Who hit you?

13
00:00:35.533 --> 00:00:36.833
A child your age

14
00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.733
Oops, kids of this age

15
00:00:40.733 --> 00:00:43.166
Bumps and bumps are inevitable

16
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.000
You were even better than him when you were a child

17
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.733
No, it's the same as a skin monkey.

18
00:00:46.733 --> 00:00:49.366
Yes, Xiaobao is at his age now

19
00:00:49.366 --> 00:00:51.766
It's normal to bump

20
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.200
What about the nanny at home?

21
00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.100
So many people can't watch a child

22
00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.266
Oh, isn't that the love between you two?

23
00:00:58.266 --> 00:01:00.100
Refuse to let anyone else take care of the child

24
00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:01.400
Are you in the hospital now?

25
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.200
It's all hoarse. It's very hard to take care of children alone

26
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:07.300
Mom, no, it's what I should do to bring Xiaobao

27
00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:08.400
That being the case

28
00:01:08.733 --> 00:01:10.400
Xiaobao, stay with me

29
00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.166
Ah that's not good

30
00:01:13.066 --> 00:01:14.233
What's wrong?

31
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.666
He's my son!

32
00:01:15.666 --> 00:01:17.433
What's wrong with staying with me?

33
00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.833
Hoarse means that your illness is not cured yet.

34
00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:21.966
I can't disturb your rest.

35
00:01:21.966 --> 00:01:23.366
Bringing children is tiring

36
00:01:23.366 --> 00:01:26.366
Yes, 17, you still need to rest well.

37
00:01:26.733 --> 00:01:28.766
Are you hiding something from me?
