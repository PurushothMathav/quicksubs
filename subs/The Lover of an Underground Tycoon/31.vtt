00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.000
Gu Nuannuan

2
00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:03.300
Don't tell me the Yingxin rice market company pays the bill

3
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:04.800
You don't even know that.

4
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.633
No matter how bad it is, it should be us AA.

5
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.800
Why should I pay alone?

6
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.300
Gu Qingqing, you are a new employee.

7
00:00:13.366 --> 00:00:15.166
Do you make any contribution to the company?

8
00:00:15.166 --> 00:00:17.466
So we'll treat you to dinner

9
00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:18.900
i

10
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:22.866
I'm giving you a chance to perform

11
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.100
This month we are all preparing for a costume design competition

12
00:00:26.166 --> 00:00:28.266
How can I take you outside the door?

13
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.433
Treat three teachers to a meal

14
00:00:32.666 --> 00:00:34.266
This is what you earned.

15
00:00:35.166 --> 00:00:37.766
Guo Jingjing, you didn't even graduate from college

16
00:00:38.133 --> 00:00:39.066
What else could he do?

17
00:00:39.066 --> 00:00:39.900
Except for chores

18
00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.266
Don't hold us back then

19
00:00:43.666 --> 00:00:46.500
The employer is kind enough to give you the opportunity to integrate with us

20
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:47.966
Still don't know how to lift

21
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.066
Isn't it just a meal?

22
00:00:50.266 --> 00:00:52.333
Millions of clothes.

23
00:00:52.333 --> 00:00:54.833
Can't afford hundreds of thousands of meals?

24
00:00:55.266 --> 00:00:56.233
What!

25
00:00:56.566 --> 00:00:59.566
The clothes on Gu Qingqing cost millions

26
00:00:59.566 --> 00:01:01.866
Mingming worked together not long ago

27
00:01:02.066 --> 00:01:04.300
Turning around, he can afford such expensive clothes

28
00:01:04.533 --> 00:01:08.433
Definitely seducing men with his face again?

29
00:01:08.466 --> 00:01:10.266
Don't embarrass Qingqing

30
00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:11.933
He's a former colleague of mine.

31
00:01:11.933 --> 00:01:13.900
I don't have that much money to check out

32
00:01:15.866 --> 00:01:17.933
So Gu Jinjin used to be your colleague?

33
00:01:17.933 --> 00:01:19.700
Do you get a high salary?

34
00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.033
Well, 6,000 a month.

35
00:01:22.666 --> 00:01:23.866
6,000 yuan a month

36
00:01:23.866 --> 00:01:24.900
It doesn't have to be incongruous.

37
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.766
10 years to afford 1 million clothes

38
00:01:28.133 --> 00:01:29.833
I I don't know

39
00:01:29.866 --> 00:01:31.866
Qingqing used to be just like us

40
00:01:31.866 --> 00:01:33.500
Only wear clothes worth a few dozen dollars

41
00:01:33.533 --> 00:01:36.666
I don't know why he suddenly became prosperous

42
00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.133
In a short period of time

43
00:01:39.133 --> 00:01:41.866
You can afford limited edition bags and clothes

44
00:01:41.866 --> 00:01:44.666
You can also enter the anorexia group with your high school degree

45
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.366
What means are there?

46
00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.833
Ah dear

47
00:01:48.966 --> 00:01:52.033
You didn't really say that to the manager.

48
00:01:52.166 --> 00:01:54.000
To accompany wealthy guests

49
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.900
I'm not talking nonsense
