00:00:00.666 --> 00:00:01.600
Good breath

2
00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:04.066
Keep it hard

3
00:00:04.066 --> 00:00:07.100
I have seen the baby's head, so hard

4
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.700
Congratulations to Miss Gu for successfully giving birth to a little princess

5
00:00:14.066 --> 00:00:14.966
Doctor

6
00:00:15.533 --> 00:00:16.333
cord blood

7
00:00:16.866 --> 00:00:18.266
Save my little treasure

8
00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:19.400
Don't worry.

9
00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:20.733
Cord blood has been preserved

10
00:00:20.733 --> 00:00:22.433
This will be sent to Xiaobao.

11
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:28.566
Bad, the mother shows signs of heavy bleeding

12
00:00:28.566 --> 00:00:29.500
Prepare for rescue

13
00:00:44.733 --> 00:00:46.966
Do you feel that your breathing is not smooth when you wake up?

14
00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.600
I'm fine. I'm fine.

15
00:00:50.533 --> 00:00:51.666
I took care of it.

16
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.266
And how about my newborn baby?

17
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.166
Don't worry, Xiaobao's surgery went well

18
00:00:56.166 --> 00:00:57.400
Just recover slowly

19
00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.900
Your newborn premature baby is currently in an incubator

20
00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:01.800
But the physiological signs are all stable

21
00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:04.900
Fortunately, the children are all right

22
00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:06.500
What about my husband?

23
00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:07.700
How is he?

24
00:01:09.733 --> 00:01:11.933
No, what do you mean?

25
00:01:11.933 --> 00:01:13.500
Didn't he come to the rescue?

26
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:14.733
Don't get excited

27
00:01:14.733 --> 00:01:16.466
Mr. Yan is currently in the ICU.

28
00:01:16.533 --> 00:01:18.166
His life was saved

29
00:01:18.366 --> 00:01:19.400
only

30
00:01:19.966 --> 00:01:21.200
Just what?
