00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:08.100
Wife

2
00:00:09.166 --> 00:00:10.566
I haven't got off work so late

3
00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.766
How did you actually get in?

4
00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.066
I called you and you didn't answer

5
00:00:17.066 --> 00:00:18.500
You don't reply if you send a message.

6
00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:19.766
I asked Assistant Lin to find out.

7
00:00:19.766 --> 00:00:21.466
It turns out that you are still working overtime at the company

8
00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:22.600
Sorry.

9
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.333
I didn't know the battery was dead.

10
00:00:24.333 --> 00:00:25.700
Worried you

11
00:00:26.933 --> 00:00:28.100
As long as you're okay

12
00:00:28.133 --> 00:00:29.366
Have you eaten yet?

13
00:00:29.666 --> 00:00:31.800
I didn't know it yet

14
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:36.533
I made it for you myself

15
00:00:36.533 --> 00:00:38.266
Your favorite Kung Pao Chicken

16
00:00:43.566 --> 00:00:44.400
You are so kind

17
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.366
Always there when I need it most

18
00:00:52.933 --> 00:00:54.300
Is there so little to fight for?

19
00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.866
I don't even want to eat

20
00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.000
By the way, let me say it first

21
00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.366
Don't you know

22
00:00:59.366 --> 00:01:01.433
I can participate in the company's design competition

23
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.066
Yan will always participate for me

24
00:01:04.066 --> 00:01:06.066
So I must work hard this time

25
00:01:06.066 --> 00:01:07.500
Must not let him down

26
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.866
You Mr. Yan are so kind to you.

27
00:01:10.066 --> 00:01:11.866
Oh, don't get me wrong.

28
00:01:11.866 --> 00:01:14.233
We, Mr. Yan, are just sucking money

29
00:01:14.366 --> 00:01:15.566
I just found out.

30
00:01:15.566 --> 00:01:18.700
I joined Yan's Group with his special approval

31
00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.800
By the way, Assistant Lin said that you helped Mr. Yan

32
00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.833
Did you give him my resume?

33
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.200
Ah!

34
00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:29.166
You know

35
00:01:29.166 --> 00:01:31.333
Otherwise, my resume for my high school degree

36
00:01:31.333 --> 00:01:33.000
How could it be in the hands of Mr. Yan?

37
00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.300
In fact, you are really my noble

38
00:01:36.966 --> 00:01:38.300
What am I?

39
00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.633
If I had the ability of your CEO Yan

40
00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.066
I won't let you suffer so much

41
00:01:44.366 --> 00:01:45.733
Where are you wronged?

42
00:01:45.733 --> 00:01:47.100
I don't feel wronged.

43
00:01:47.333 --> 00:01:48.766
After marrying you

44
00:01:48.766 --> 00:01:51.300
You not only helped me get rid of the cannibalistic family

45
00:01:51.333 --> 00:01:52.900
Saved me again and again

46
00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:54.800
He also helped me pay for my grandmother's medical expenses

47
00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:56.866
Even entering the night market group

48
00:01:56.866 --> 00:01:58.766
I got in because of you.

49
00:02:01.566 --> 00:02:01.733
Ok

50
00:02:01.733 --> 00:02:03.700
I'm just a despised farmer after all

51
00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:04.600
Work

52
00:02:06.466 --> 00:02:07.966
If I had your anorexia

53
00:02:07.966 --> 00:02:09.800
It's good to have such an identity

54
00:02:12.866 --> 00:02:14.466
I like you like this

55
00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.666
Honest, kind and loving

56
00:02:16.666 --> 00:02:18.700
Always helping others in obscurity

57
00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.366
If you are really Yan Zhiqing

58
00:02:20.366 --> 00:02:22.033
I will not marry you

59
00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.100
Oh, why?
