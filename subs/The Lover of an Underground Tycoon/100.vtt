00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:02.733
He injured multiple organs

2
00:00:02.733 --> 00:00:04.066
That's not good.

3
00:00:04.066 --> 00:00:05.933
If you don't wake up within a month

4
00:00:05.933 --> 00:00:07.733
I'm afraid he'll have to lie in bed for the rest of his life

5
00:00:07.733 --> 00:00:10.566
Become a vegetable

6
00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.466
Miss Gu, Miss Gu, are you alright?

7
00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:17.633
I'm fine. I'm fine.

8
00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:19.833
That's what happened.

9
00:00:20.066 --> 00:00:21.400
I can't be fine

10
00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.800
Xiaobao and Xiaomei still need me

11
00:00:24.166 --> 00:00:27.000
Miss Gu, please rest and recover first.

12
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.400
There is still a month left.

13
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.066
Mr. Ye might wake up sometime soon

14
00:00:31.066 --> 00:00:33.466
It's a doctor, you're right

15
00:00:33.533 --> 00:00:35.966
He will definitely wake up

16
00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.366
Doctor, please give me more medicine to replenish my body.

17
00:00:39.366 --> 00:00:40.766
I need to get better soon.

18
00:00:43.566 --> 00:00:45.900
Why is the big slacker still

19
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.866
17 You have been asleep for a month

20
00:00:51.866 --> 00:00:53.066
Why aren't you awake?

21
00:00:54.366 --> 00:00:56.766
Xiaobao has almost recovered

22
00:00:56.766 --> 00:00:59.433
I can already bounce around like a normal child

23
00:01:01.733 --> 00:01:04.700
Our Danny was also born safely

24
00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:06.133
I've recovered pretty much as well.

25
00:01:06.133 --> 00:01:08.700
A family of four is missing you

26
00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:11.566
You are their father

27
00:01:11.566 --> 00:01:13.166
You have to set an example for them

28
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.033
Do you want to be laughed at by the children?

29
00:01:17.533 --> 00:01:18.366
Leaf 17

30
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.300
If you don't wake up

31
00:01:20.466 --> 00:01:22.200
I took them to remarry
