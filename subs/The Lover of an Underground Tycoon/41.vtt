00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.100
What are you talking about?

2
00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:02.500
Why don't I understand?

3
00:00:03.133 --> 00:00:04.133
These photos

4
00:00:04.133 --> 00:00:06.266
It was all intercepted from the perspective of hotel surveillance

5
00:00:06.266 --> 00:00:07.666
You as a hotel manager

6
00:00:07.666 --> 00:00:09.400
It's very easy to get these monitors.

7
00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:12.466
I'm not the only one who can access video surveillance

8
00:00:12.533 --> 00:00:14.466
What makes you think it's me?

9
00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:16.300
Manager Zhu Rili Wanji

10
00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:17.900
Where is the time to go to great lengths

11
00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:19.266
For a departing employee

12
00:00:19.266 --> 00:00:21.033
Monitoring and slandering you?

13
00:00:21.166 --> 00:00:21.966
Xiao Li

14
00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:24.166
It's not like you don't know what kind of person he is

15
00:00:24.166 --> 00:00:25.133
When I was working part-time

16
00:00:25.133 --> 00:00:26.633
He would put little shoes on me everywhere

17
00:00:26.733 --> 00:00:28.866
This time I want to use the dealer for me.

18
00:00:29.166 --> 00:00:31.200
Instead of causing me to fail, I was demoted

19
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.766
He has every reason to make up these rumors

20
00:00:33.766 --> 00:00:35.000
Trying to get revenge on me

21
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.300
Manager Zhu is just talking about old things

22
00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.800
If you offend the guest, of course he will educate you.

23
00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.400
Yesterday you wanted to eat Overlord meal

24
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.266
Manager Zhu wants to pay off the debt with your clothes

25
00:00:43.266 --> 00:00:45.433
Isn't this normal?

26
00:00:45.566 --> 00:00:47.333
It's just that you are indiscreet.

27
00:00:47.333 --> 00:00:49.100
He also slandered Manager Zhu in turn

28
00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.866
Do you know

29
00:00:49.866 --> 00:00:52.333
How much damage did your behavior cause to the hotel?

30
00:00:52.333 --> 00:00:55.066
Lose us serious waiters

31
00:00:55.066 --> 00:00:56.500
Your reputation has been damaged by you

32
00:00:56.533 --> 00:00:58.100
Manager Zhu didn't settle the bill with you

33
00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:59.833
You came to the door instead

34
00:01:00.066 --> 00:01:03.400
Gu Qingqing always pays attention to evidence

35
00:01:03.566 --> 00:01:06.466
If you reverse black and white and slander me like this again

36
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.166
I'm going to call the police.

37
00:01:08.166 --> 00:01:09.700
Then call the police.

38
00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.833
The Internet Protocol Address is at the Star Hotel

39
00:01:15.933 --> 00:01:17.266
You didn't lie

40
00:01:17.333 --> 00:01:19.300
It was also the staff of your hotel who spread rumors.

41
00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.266
When the police verify

42
00:01:21.266 --> 00:01:23.066
But it's all clear

43
00:01:23.066 --> 00:01:25.233
Who are you not?

44
00:01:25.533 --> 00:01:27.300
My dignified five-star hotel

45
00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:30.566
How can you, a migrant worker, just enter?

46
00:01:30.566 --> 00:01:31.700
He's my husband.

47
00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:33.766
Your husband?

48
00:01:33.933 --> 00:01:36.066
It's this poor migrant worker

49
00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:39.800
I bought this million-dollar limited edition for you.

50
00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.366
Hahaha

51
00:01:41.366 --> 00:01:44.366
Sir, you have to watch your head.

52
00:01:44.366 --> 00:01:47.366
So as not to be wearing several hats without knowing

53
00:01:48.766 --> 00:01:50.666
Oh, Lee, I'm afraid

54
00:01:50.666 --> 00:01:53.000
I don't know what kind of person your wife is, do you?

55
00:01:53.066 --> 00:01:55.966
When he was working at our hotel

56
00:01:55.966 --> 00:01:58.566
That's when you take the initiative to cry when you see father and son?

57
00:01:58.566 --> 00:02:00.366
Look at what he's wearing

58
00:02:00.366 --> 00:02:02.966
Which one is you, a poor migrant worker?

59
00:02:02.966 --> 00:02:04.800
You can afford it.

60
00:02:10.933 --> 00:02:11.966
Manager Zhu

61
00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.566
It's all my fault I know it's wrong

62
00:02:14.566 --> 00:02:16.600
Please stop talking.

63
00:02:17.333 --> 00:02:20.633
Stop choreographing me in front of my husband, okay?
