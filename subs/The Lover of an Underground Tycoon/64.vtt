00:00:02.933 --> 00:00:03.833
Why is that?

2
00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:06.900
I am a poor household who was kicked out of the Gu family

3
00:00:07.466 --> 00:00:08.566
And you

4
00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:11.800
He is the richest man in Yuncheng

5
00:00:11.933 --> 00:00:13.433
President of the Anorexia Group

6
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:15.400
I don't deserve you

7
00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.666
Do you deserve it or not? It doesn't matter what you say.

8
00:00:18.666 --> 00:00:19.866
It's what I say

9
00:00:19.966 --> 00:00:24.400
Mr. Yan, I know you are tired of eating big fish and big meat

10
00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.033
Occasionally interested in my porridge side dish

11
00:00:27.966 --> 00:00:31.366
But porridge side dishes are always just seasonings

12
00:00:31.366 --> 00:00:33.733
You still have to go back to your Manchu and Han seats.

13
00:00:33.733 --> 00:00:35.200
Shuangdao Gu Qingqing

14
00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:36.366
Are you

15
00:00:36.366 --> 00:00:38.500
Do you think I'm a heartless person?

16
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.100
After these few months of getting along

17
00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.366
Do you think I'm on a whim?

18
00:00:43.533 --> 00:00:44.666
Or say

19
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:48.766
You never believed in my integrity

20
00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.300
So what if you mean it?

21
00:00:53.966 --> 00:00:55.800
A top wealthy family like the Yan family

22
00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.766
Will allow me to be covered in such a

23
00:00:57.766 --> 00:00:59.033
Black history people enter the door

24
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.100
Swallow 17

25
00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.233
Be realistic

26
00:01:04.066 --> 00:01:07.400
Your wife will be the future star of misanthropy

27
00:01:09.366 --> 00:01:11.500
How many people are staring at him

28
00:01:11.533 --> 00:01:13.233
His words and deeds

29
00:01:13.366 --> 00:01:16.566
His slightest mistake will be magnified infinitely

30
00:01:18.166 --> 00:01:19.366
These few months

31
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.833
Let's just say we're in a romantic relationship.

32
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.033
I thought I had a sweet dream

33
00:01:28.566 --> 00:01:30.666
Now I'm awake

34
00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.433
How are you free now?

35
00:01:35.566 --> 00:01:38.300
Go get divorced when you have time

36
00:01:39.133 --> 00:01:40.100
Good gathering and good dispersal

37
00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:44.166
What are you doing?

38
00:01:44.166 --> 00:01:45.700
It was you who mentioned the beginning

39
00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.233
Now you have to mention it a few times

40
00:01:47.733 --> 00:01:49.566
Is it too unfair to me?

41
00:01:49.566 --> 00:01:50.566
You put me down

42
00:01:50.566 --> 00:01:51.600
Where are you taking me?
