00:00:00.733 --> 00:00:02.100
I'm Gu Qingqing.

2
00:00:02.333 --> 00:00:03.633
She's your sister.

3
00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:08.100
17 He is my sister

4
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:09.366
Where are you hospitalized?

5
00:00:09.366 --> 00:00:12.900
Sister, why are you still running around when you are sick?

6
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.066
17 is my husband

7
00:00:15.066 --> 00:00:16.766
I'll take care of 17.

8
00:00:16.766 --> 00:00:18.700
I won't let you worry

9
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.033
World, I am your Miss Gu

10
00:00:22.166 --> 00:00:25.066
I know you sisters have a good relationship.

11
00:00:25.066 --> 00:00:27.833
You're forgiven for worrying about your brother-in-law's health

12
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.100
But after all, Siya is there

13
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.166
He will take good care of Shi Qing

14
00:00:33.766 --> 00:00:37.166
Siya take Shi Qing to have a good rest

15
00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.466
Shi Qing, let's go back and rest

16
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.200
Gu Siya is obviously the wife on my marriage certificate

17
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.500
But why do I reject his affection so much?

18
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.400
I guess it's because of eleven

19
00:00:46.533 --> 00:00:48.100
Just wait until your memory is restored

20
00:00:49.966 --> 00:00:51.200
I can do it myself.

21
00:01:01.133 --> 00:01:03.333
Gu Qingqing, didn't I warn you?

22
00:01:03.333 --> 00:01:04.900
Stay away from my son

23
00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:08.100
Now he has completely forgotten about you.

24
00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.700
He doesn't remember me.

25
00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.366
My son has long forgotten about you

26
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:14.566
Now.

27
00:01:15.166 --> 00:01:18.166
You two have nothing to do with each other

28
00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:21.366
Stay away from my son and daughter-in-law

29
00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.466
You two have nothing to do with each other

30
00:01:35.066 --> 00:01:36.900
Jing Jing, are you alright?

31
00:01:37.166 --> 00:01:39.900
Senior, how are you?
