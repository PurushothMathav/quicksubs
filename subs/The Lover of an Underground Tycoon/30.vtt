00:00:00.566 --> 00:00:02.300
Another bottle of '82 Lafite

2
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:10.500
The most expensive dishes in a five-star hotel

3
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.766
This meal is worth hundreds of thousands

4
00:00:13.266 --> 00:00:16.466
The deputy supervisor needs to spend so much money, please Gu Qingqing

5
00:00:16.533 --> 00:00:18.366
Is this too cheap?

6
00:00:19.666 --> 00:00:22.466
Gu Qingqing, a waste who didn't even go to college

7
00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:23.866
Worthy of this sentence

8
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.433
Let's raise a glass together

9
00:00:28.533 --> 00:00:29.833
Welcome new colleagues

10
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.466
Hello everyone, please give me more advice in the future

Wu Qingqing

12
00:00:40.166 --> 00:00:44.266
As bosses and seniors, we will toast you first

13
00:00:44.466 --> 00:00:46.366
Don't you know how to respond?

14
00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:52.100
Let me make a toast.

15
00:00:53.966 --> 00:00:56.666
Toast, no one toasts all

16
00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:59.600
Don't you even know this workplace etiquette?

17
00:01:02.166 --> 00:01:04.166
I'm not a good drinker

18
00:01:09.966 --> 00:01:12.166
The employer takes care of me and toasts you.

19
00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.700
Please take care of me in the future.

20
00:01:21.066 --> 00:01:22.433
Is that more like it?

21
00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:23.800
Other colleagues

22
00:01:24.166 --> 00:01:25.700
It's all a toast, right?

23
00:01:59.466 --> 00:02:02.466
This lady spent a total of 457,000 yuan tonight

24
00:02:02.466 --> 00:02:03.866
Do you want to use it?

25
00:02:03.866 --> 00:02:05.800
Tonight's treat is mutual kisses

26
00:02:06.133 --> 00:02:07.466
You ask him how to invite

27
00:02:08.666 --> 00:02:09.566
What!
