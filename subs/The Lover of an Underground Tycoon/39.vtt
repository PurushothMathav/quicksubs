00:00:01.266 --> 00:00:03.066
Are you okay?

2
00:00:03.166 --> 00:00:05.266
How about you?

3
00:00:10.333 --> 00:00:12.566
Gu Qingqing was recruited by me personally

4
00:00:12.933 --> 00:00:14.766
Do you have a problem?

5
00:00:14.766 --> 00:00:18.300
What Gu Qingqing was recruited by Mr. Yan himself?

6
00:00:18.566 --> 00:00:20.466
But doesn't he only have a high school degree?

7
00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:21.266
World-weary group

8
00:00:21.266 --> 00:00:22.466
That's because of his ability.

9
00:00:22.466 --> 00:00:24.600
Enough to break this world-weary rule

10
00:00:25.066 --> 00:00:27.266
Costume design competition in a month

11
00:00:27.466 --> 00:00:28.700
Gu Qingqing will see you again

12
00:00:29.466 --> 00:00:32.466
At that time, he will prove it with his strength

13
00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:34.800
He is enough to stay on the rocks

14
00:00:36.766 --> 00:00:39.233
What to participate in the design competition

15
00:00:39.366 --> 00:00:41.600
I have been in the company for three years before I can participate

16
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:42.333
Stop talking about you.

17
00:00:42.333 --> 00:00:43.533
I've been here for five years.

18
00:00:43.533 --> 00:00:44.966
It's my first time.

19
00:00:45.766 --> 00:00:49.066
You must use some means to break Mr. Yanziyan gently

20
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.400
That's not appropriate.

21
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.600
The company stipulates that you must be employed for three years

22
00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.766
And only those who are filial to excellent people can participate

23
00:00:55.133 --> 00:00:57.133
Gu Qingqing is now embroiled in scandals

24
00:00:57.133 --> 00:00:59.166
Participate in the color set competition at this time

25
00:00:59.366 --> 00:01:01.566
Terrible, it will damage the company's image, right?

26
00:01:01.566 --> 00:01:03.500
Rules are made to be broken

27
00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.266
I believe that with Gu Qingqing's ability

28
00:01:05.266 --> 00:01:06.700
Enough to participate in this competition

29
00:01:07.566 --> 00:01:08.400
And

30
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.166
The company will investigate this hot search incident clearly.

31
00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.500
Before the truth is lost

32
00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.266
And then we have drug disseminators.

33
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.900
Dismissal

34
00:01:22.133 --> 00:01:22.933
Mr. Yan

35
00:01:25.566 --> 00:01:27.066
Thank you for your trust in me.

36
00:01:27.266 --> 00:01:29.700
I will definitely do my best to prepare for this competition

37
00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:30.966
Don't let you down

38
00:01:34.366 --> 00:01:35.266
And

39
00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.966
As for the false things in the hot search

40
00:01:37.966 --> 00:01:40.133
I will find evidence to prove my innocence.

41
00:01:40.133 --> 00:01:41.633
Never implicate the company

42
00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:42.700
At that time

43
00:01:42.733 --> 00:01:45.200
I want to slander those who slander me today

44
00:01:45.266 --> 00:01:46.433
Apologize to me
