00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:02.800
You are the old man from five years ago

2
00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:04.033
Yes, Mr. Yan

3
00:00:04.066 --> 00:00:06.500
At that time, our family was at Qingcheng Hotel

4
00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:08.366
Held a sister's celebration

5
00:00:08.366 --> 00:00:09.666
Sister, she's drunk.

6
00:00:09.666 --> 00:00:11.800
So I took her to her room.

7
00:00:11.933 --> 00:00:14.800
But when passing by the room at the 888 Hotel

8
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.866
Suddenly someone grabbed me

9
00:00:16.866 --> 00:00:19.600
I was indeed in my parents' room

10
00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:20.800
Think about it.

11
00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.533
He grabbed a passing woman

12
00:00:22.533 --> 00:00:24.166
Why did you come to me only now?

13
00:00:24.733 --> 00:00:26.966
That's what happened back then

14
00:00:26.966 --> 00:00:31.200
Why is that bitch so lucky if you don't kiss her?

15
00:00:31.466 --> 00:00:34.166
Not only did he sleep with the richest man in the early morning

16
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.266
And gave him a son

17
00:00:37.366 --> 00:00:40.000
Now it's your luck

18
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:41.966
What do you mean?

19
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.800
Anorexic doesn't know who the woman was that night

20
00:00:44.966 --> 00:00:48.000
Just rely on the half jade pendant left to Gu Qingqing to find someone

21
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.866
I have already told his subordinates.

22
00:00:50.166 --> 00:00:52.000
The woman that night was you

23
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.933
That kid was thrown into the orphanage by me

24
00:00:54.933 --> 00:00:57.100
Your dad is going to pick him up

25
00:00:57.133 --> 00:00:58.666
You better go home now.

26
00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.166
Take the child to find the anorexic minister

27
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:02.866
Can the Gu family turn over?

28
00:01:02.933 --> 00:01:04.133
It's all up to you

29
00:01:04.133 --> 00:01:07.300
Mom, you think too simply.

30
00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.200
To kiss such a cautious person

31
00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.600
If you take my word for it

32
00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.533
He did a paternity test.

33
00:01:13.533 --> 00:01:15.966
Isn't this completely exposed?

34
00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:17.500
Don't worry.

35
00:01:17.533 --> 00:01:20.100
I have prepared Gu Qingqing's hair for you.

36
00:01:20.366 --> 00:01:22.066
It's absolutely foolproof.

37
00:01:22.766 --> 00:01:24.300
If it wasn't for your people coming to me

38
00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:26.900
I don't think I'll ever come to you in my life

39
00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:27.666
Mr. Ye

40
00:01:27.666 --> 00:01:30.166
I found out that the white eyebrow jade was found by lawyer Liu

41
00:01:30.166 --> 00:01:31.766
Only then did I find Miss Gu

42
00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.400
You go out first

43
00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.166
Five years ago, I was 18.

44
00:01:37.166 --> 00:01:40.366
Like everyone else, they are looking forward to the future outside

45
00:01:40.366 --> 00:01:42.566
Who knew something like that would happen?

46
00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:45.800
Later, I was too afraid to tell my parents

47
00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.800
So I hurried abroad.

48
00:01:48.666 --> 00:01:50.700
I accidentally found myself pregnant

49
00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.766
The doctor told me I was weak

50
00:01:54.066 --> 00:01:55.366
No abortion

51
00:01:55.366 --> 00:01:58.400
If I had an abortion, it would make me infertile for life

52
00:01:59.133 --> 00:02:02.466
I just decided to have a baby

53
00:02:04.166 --> 00:02:05.000
Xiaobao

54
00:02:05.566 --> 00:02:06.600
Spend time with me abroad

55
00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.733
After those lonely and helpless years

56
00:02:08.733 --> 00:02:10.666
As he grew up day by day

57
00:02:10.666 --> 00:02:13.066
Yelling for dad every day

58
00:02:13.133 --> 00:02:15.300
I want to give him a complete home

59
00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.600
Did your people find me?

60
00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.166
I just brought him to you

61
00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:21.900
Full of lies

62
00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.366
Qingqing was clearly talking about this woman Xiaoyao

63
00:02:24.366 --> 00:02:25.366
Framed her

64
00:02:25.533 --> 00:02:27.700
What is she still pretending to be a sister here?

65
00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.000
But the details she said five years ago

66
00:02:31.133 --> 00:02:33.633
But it all matches my situation that day

67
00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.100
If Mr. Yan doesn't believe it

68
00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:36.966
Here's my DNA and Xia Bao's DNA

69
00:02:37.666 --> 00:02:38.666
She plays with her

70
00:02:43.966 --> 00:02:44.766
And so forth.

71
00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:48.866
Take it and welcome it.

72
00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:50.300
Yes, Mr. Yan

73
00:02:56.333 --> 00:02:58.066
Your name is Xiaobao

74
00:02:58.133 --> 00:02:59.833
You are my father
