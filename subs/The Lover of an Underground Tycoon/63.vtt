1
00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:10.000
quietly

2
00:00:11.533 --> 00:00:12.700
I Love You

3
00:00:14.333 --> 00:00:15.700
No matter if I am Qin Shi

4
00:00:16.066 --> 00:00:17.433
Still world-weary

5
00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.300
I have the same feelings for you.

6
00:00:21.733 --> 00:00:23.333
I didn't mean to lie to you on purpose.

7
00:00:23.333 --> 00:00:24.833
I also want to tell you the truth.

8
00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:26.666
Only when I heard

9
00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:29.200
When you won't marry Yan Shiqing

10
00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:31.366
I hesitated.

11
00:00:32.266 --> 00:00:34.100
I'm afraid I'll tell you the truth

12
00:00:34.966 --> 00:00:36.766
You will leave me behind

13
00:00:39.766 --> 00:00:41.566
Actually for a while

14
00:00:43.866 --> 00:00:46.300
And that's how I came to be.

15
00:00:49.466 --> 00:00:52.200
Everyone thinks that the world-weary leader has a lot of fame

16
00:00:53.566 --> 00:00:55.700
But I don't know that there is danger behind it

17
00:00:56.133 --> 00:00:59.000
I was 18.

18
00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:01.900
Which is a lot like you.

19
00:01:02.066 --> 00:01:05.066
My father was killed by a business adversary.

20
00:01:06.466 --> 00:01:08.133
I was promoted to my father's wave of control

21
00:01:08.133 --> 00:01:09.033
world-weary

22
00:01:09.733 --> 00:01:11.433
Poor man was poisoned

23
00:01:11.766 --> 00:01:13.633
Although my life was saved

24
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.833
But it left this embarrassing scar

25
00:01:19.866 --> 00:01:21.766
But at my lowest point

26
00:01:21.933 --> 00:01:23.400
Father died

27
00:01:24.933 --> 00:01:26.400
I was in danger.

28
00:01:27.266 --> 00:01:29.700
Everyone thinks we've done something wrong

29
00:01:32.066 --> 00:01:34.400
Those who used to flatter us

30
00:01:34.933 --> 00:01:36.900
They start to avoid us

31
00:01:38.166 --> 00:01:41.233
Some will even be injured miserably

32
00:01:42.133 --> 00:01:43.400
Too bad I'm lucky

33
00:01:43.933 --> 00:01:45.733
I not only survived

34
00:01:45.733 --> 00:01:47.433
And I made a comeback.

35
00:01:48.566 --> 00:01:49.866
Those people

36
00:01:50.866 --> 00:01:52.666
Come around like flies again

37
00:01:52.666 --> 00:01:55.700
Say nice things about crocodiles to me

38
00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:56.900
Their laughter

39
00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.400
As hypocritical as you can be.

40
00:02:05.166 --> 00:02:07.466
In fact, that's how the world works, isn't it?

41
00:02:07.466 --> 00:02:09.166
When you're okay

42
00:02:09.666 --> 00:02:11.233
Dogs will see you

43
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.433
Once you reach

44
00:02:14.333 --> 00:02:16.266
Your fart smells good

45
00:02:16.866 --> 00:02:18.833
You are a world-weary president

46
00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.000
Why are you so rude?

47
00:02:25.166 --> 00:02:26.800
You finally listened to me

48
00:02:27.966 --> 00:02:29.766
Oh, Flower and Grass Li Fufei?

49
00:02:30.133 --> 00:02:32.100
I am the president of Yan's Group

50
00:02:32.766 --> 00:02:34.500
How many Yingying Yanyan are there around?

51
00:02:35.666 --> 00:02:37.633
But when I was Qin Shi

52
00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:41.266
Who among the rich has looked me in the eye?

53
00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:43.700
I don't want my other half

54
00:02:44.133 --> 00:02:46.700
A person who only covets the whole world

55
00:02:46.933 --> 00:02:49.033
But someone who truly loves me

56
00:02:49.666 --> 00:02:52.033
People who want to be with me for the rest of their lives

57
00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.200
Of course there is another reason

58
00:02:56.766 --> 00:02:58.966
But I confirmed what happened 5 years ago

59
00:02:59.466 --> 00:03:00.500
Tell the money again

60
00:03:01.666 --> 00:03:02.766
Very lucky

61
00:03:03.466 --> 00:03:04.000
I finally

62
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.233
I found someone who doesn't care who I am

63
00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:11.500
piano

64
00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.566
Would you like to continue with me?

65
00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:19.566
Ye Shiqing

66
00:03:20.266 --> 00:03:21.766
Let's get a divorce.
