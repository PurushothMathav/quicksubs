00:00:00.533 --> 00:00:02.366
Are you crazy in the new century?

2
00:00:02.366 --> 00:00:03.966
We just agreed to get married

3
00:00:04.066 --> 00:00:05.266
Do we learn?

4
00:00:05.266 --> 00:00:06.066
you

5
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.933
This is my grandson's wife

6
00:00:08.933 --> 00:00:11.300
Grandma, hurry up, hurry up, hurry up

7
00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:14.633
Look at the real logo.

8
00:00:14.666 --> 00:00:17.300
At a glance, you are a lucky person

9
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:18.966
Grandma introduce

10
00:00:19.133 --> 00:00:20.933
This is my wife Qingqing

11
00:00:20.933 --> 00:00:23.266
Gu Qingqing is the one

12
00:00:23.266 --> 00:00:26.400
The one who won the first place at the International Costume Awards

13
00:00:27.066 --> 00:00:28.866
I always watch live broadcasts.

14
00:00:28.866 --> 00:00:30.600
Just finished reading it

15
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:34.100
He's much prettier than on TV

16
00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:35.900
That's right, that's him.

17
00:00:36.533 --> 00:00:38.000
Our family is green

18
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Amazing to win an international award so young

19
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.566
Shi Qing, you are so lucky

20
00:00:47.133 --> 00:00:49.700
Qingqing, you will come to our house in the future

21
00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.466
Just don't be shy

22
00:00:52.466 --> 00:00:54.666
This is your home

23
00:00:54.766 --> 00:00:57.500
How can the old lady be called the old lady?

24
00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:00.900
You and Chi Qing are married

25
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.433
Call grandma like him

26
00:01:05.466 --> 00:01:08.566
Hey grandson-in-law

27
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.200
Does your master have anything to tell me?

28
00:01:13.533 --> 00:01:14.700
This brat

29
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.666
Tell me if he wants to bully you

30
00:01:18.266 --> 00:01:19.533
Let me help you.

31
00:01:19.533 --> 00:01:20.366
Beat him up

32
00:01:20.966 --> 00:01:22.666
No, he didn't bully me.

33
00:01:22.666 --> 00:01:23.966
I finally married him

34
00:01:23.966 --> 00:01:25.500
How could I possibly bully him?

35
00:01:26.933 --> 00:01:28.633
If he runs away

36
00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.966
Where can I find such a good wife?

37
00:01:31.533 --> 00:01:35.100
Take a good look to see you so loving

38
00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.333
I'm relieved.

39
00:01:37.333 --> 00:01:38.566
I tell you

40
00:01:38.566 --> 00:01:43.966
Qingjiang is an heirloom that we swallowed dry

41
00:01:43.966 --> 00:01:46.100
This time it's yours.

42
00:01:46.966 --> 00:01:48.900
Grandma, it's too expensive for me to take

43
00:01:49.666 --> 00:01:51.600
Why can't you accept it?

44
00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.633
Do you dislike my wife?

45
00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:55.633
How could I possibly dislike you?

46
00:01:56.066 --> 00:01:57.000
I don't deserve it

47
00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.866
What a cat and a dog

48
00:01:58.866 --> 00:02:01.166
You can also enter the gate of our Yan family
