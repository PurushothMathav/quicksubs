00:00:11.766 --> 00:00:12.900
Don't say

2
00:00:13.566 --> 00:00:15.066
You and us Mr. Yan

3
00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.400
It really looks alike

4
00:00:18.666 --> 00:00:20.766
I am a poor migrant worker

5
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.133
Mingyan is always the richest man in Yuncheng

6
00:00:23.133 --> 00:00:24.766
How can I compare to him?

7
00:00:24.766 --> 00:00:26.366
What happened to the richest man in Yuncheng?

8
00:00:26.366 --> 00:00:28.766
Not a 30-year-old bachelor

9
00:00:29.466 --> 00:00:30.766
An old age

10
00:00:30.866 --> 00:00:32.466
Not even honest

11
00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.066
He's only 29 and not 30 yet.

12
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.766
Something like that.

13
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.666
By the way, actually

14
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.400
Let me tell you a secret.

15
00:00:46.466 --> 00:00:50.466
Ah, you said that our cousin uncle of Yan Tong

16
00:00:50.566 --> 00:00:52.566
It's Mr. He who wants to force me

17
00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:54.100
He has quirks

18
00:00:54.733 --> 00:00:55.966
His previous predecessors

19
00:00:56.333 --> 00:00:59.166
They were all tortured to death by him.

20
00:00:59.766 --> 00:01:00.766
I see.

21
00:01:02.066 --> 00:01:03.866
Yan is always his cousin grandson

22
00:01:03.933 --> 00:01:06.366
I think there must be some quirks too

23
00:01:06.366 --> 00:01:08.133
Otherwise, why are you so old?

24
00:01:08.133 --> 00:01:10.766
There's no one, right?

25
00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.900
Damn this surnamed He

26
00:01:16.066 --> 00:01:18.200
Injury to my image in my wife's heart

27
00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:19.933
Just put him in jail

28
00:01:19.933 --> 00:01:21.600
So biased

29
00:01:23.666 --> 00:01:25.600
In fact, don't worry.

30
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:27.366
I am your wife

31
00:01:27.466 --> 00:01:28.900
Then they like me again

32
00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:31.633
I will never move on.

33
00:01:32.866 --> 00:01:35.700
In fact, it's okay to move on

34
00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.600
What are you talking about?

35
00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.000
I... you don't want me anymore

36
00:01:41.333 --> 00:01:43.266
It's not that mom doesn't want me

37
00:01:43.266 --> 00:01:46.400
Dad doesn't want me, not even you

38
00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.500
Qingqing, I don't want you

39
00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.100
It's true. It's true.

40
00:01:52.866 --> 00:01:54.266
I like you too late

41
00:01:54.266 --> 00:01:55.833
How could I not want you?

42
00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.900
that

43
00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:58.800
So you're married to me?

44
00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:00.233
Why don't you have sex with me?

45
00:02:01.266 --> 00:02:02.366
Pardon me?

46
00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:04.000
I want a bridal chamber

47
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.033
I want a bridal chamber

48
00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.033
I want a bridal chamber

49
00:02:06.133 --> 00:02:07.000
I want a bridal chamber
