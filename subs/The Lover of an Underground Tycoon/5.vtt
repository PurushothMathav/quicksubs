00:00:01.266 --> 00:00:02.066
Mr. Yan

2
00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:06.633
What's he doing here?

3
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:08.966
Mr. Yan welcomes you

4
00:00:08.966 --> 00:00:11.866
Your arrival makes our hotel shine

5
00:00:11.933 --> 00:00:14.500
You see, this is our gold medal waiter.

6
00:00:16.333 --> 00:00:17.133
Be careful

7
00:00:18.733 --> 00:00:19.366
Last game

8
00:00:19.366 --> 00:00:20.600
The last one is

9
00:00:34.366 --> 00:00:35.933
Mr. Yan, Miss Guo

10
00:00:35.933 --> 00:00:38.200
She has low blood sugar due to overwork

11
00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:39.000
hard decision

12
00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:40.666
Overwork

13
00:00:47.366 --> 00:00:48.066
Mr. Yan

14
00:00:48.066 --> 00:00:50.433
I found out that Miss Gu was hospitalized because of her grandmother's brain tumor

15
00:00:50.666 --> 00:00:51.966
Requires a large treatment fee

16
00:00:51.966 --> 00:00:54.166
Miss Gu works three jobs a day to make money

17
00:01:14.966 --> 00:01:17.000
How do you feel when you wake up?

18
00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.833
It's okay, it's hypoglycemia

19
00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:22.666
Who brought me to the hospital?

20
00:01:22.733 --> 00:01:23.800
It's Seventeen Yan

21
00:01:24.533 --> 00:01:25.633
Seventeen Swallow

22
00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.133
It was Princess Yan who carried you to the hospital all the way

23
00:01:28.133 --> 00:01:30.000
You don't know how handsome Yan is

24
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.300
To have a good appearance

25
00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:32.700
To have a figure

26
00:01:32.733 --> 00:01:35.300
In the entertainment industry, that would be a proper male doctor.

27
00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.133
I thought the richest people had beer bellies

28
00:01:37.133 --> 00:01:38.633
What about the big bald old man?

29
00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:41.200
Hey, by the way, Qingqing, do you know Qingqing?

30
00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.600
He looked nervous when you fainted

31
00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:45.933
How could you possibly know him?

32
00:01:45.933 --> 00:01:48.466
Mowgli is warm-hearted

33
00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.200
It's not because he knew Mr. He wanted to marry me

34
00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:55.400
So treat me as your uncle
