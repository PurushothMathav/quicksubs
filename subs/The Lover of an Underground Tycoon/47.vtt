00:00:01.333 --> 00:00:02.966
lose the guess

2
00:00:08.666 --> 00:00:09.766
Thank you, Sister Nan Nan

3
00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:12.166
If I can stay in the company this time

4
00:00:12.166 --> 00:00:14.466
I will definitely repay you well in the future.

5
00:00:14.866 --> 00:00:18.400
Don't worry, the leader and I are both money-sucking people.

6
00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.300
How could I have the heart for a truly powerful person like you?

7
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:22.633
Brushed down

8
00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.400
It's over

9
00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:46.400
That's it.

10
00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.400
Just come back tomorrow to perfect some small details

11
00:00:52.466 --> 00:00:55.200
You can definitely steal him in this game

12
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.266
Borrow you auspicious words

13
00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.033
Go back and rest so late

14
00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:03.033
Let's go

15
00:01:13.566 --> 00:01:16.066
What happened to Sister Ding's design draft this time?

16
00:01:16.066 --> 00:01:17.800
See for yourself

17
00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.766
This afternoon is the costume design competition.

18
00:01:26.766 --> 00:01:28.700
The leader will probably come and announce later

19
00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:29.933
Who can enter the competition?

20
00:01:29.933 --> 00:01:31.500
Generally everyone can participate

21
00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.233
It depends on who is higher

22
00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.366
I don't know if the leadership requirements are high or not

23
00:01:35.366 --> 00:01:37.566
I hope I don't get fired at the company

24
00:01:37.566 --> 00:01:38.866
Come, come, sit down

25
00:01:41.066 --> 00:01:43.500
I said I'm a real person

26
00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.400
Everything is based on strength alone

27
00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:47.266
I can tolerate your private life

28
00:01:47.266 --> 00:01:48.800
I can tolerate your luggage.

29
00:01:48.966 --> 00:01:51.800
But I can't stand people with bad character

30
00:01:52.533 --> 00:01:56.500
Gu Qingqing, I now officially choose you to be fired.
