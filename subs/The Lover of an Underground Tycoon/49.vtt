00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.733
I have seen all the designs of heating since I started

2
00:00:02.733 --> 00:00:04.133
His entry this time

3
00:00:04.133 --> 00:00:06.366
It continues his previous design style

4
00:00:06.366 --> 00:00:08.900
The design is more mature and atmospheric

5
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:10.500
A person's design level

6
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.466
May change over time

7
00:00:12.466 --> 00:00:15.166
Change but the design style does not

8
00:00:16.266 --> 00:00:17.400
I'm pretty sure.

9
00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.366
This is Gu Nuannuan's design.

10
00:00:22.466 --> 00:00:24.600
You were caught and sentenced, what are you still arguing about?

11
00:00:24.933 --> 00:00:26.400
Get out of the night market group obediently

12
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.633
There's no room for a piece of trash like you

13
00:00:28.933 --> 00:00:30.466
Hmm, that's bad.

14
00:00:30.466 --> 00:00:33.100
Linda caught the Lone Eagle this time

15
00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:35.000
It's hard to say whether you can stay here or not

16
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.133
This world-weary, he doesn't want to stay any longer

17
00:00:37.133 --> 00:00:39.200
How did you get into the world-weary you stinky plagiarist?

18
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.733
I really don't know what's going on

19
00:00:40.733 --> 00:00:41.800
Just go.

20
00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.766
Lead me to apply for viewing.

21
00:00:45.766 --> 00:00:47.800
All the design drafts since Gu Nuannuan joined the job

22
00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:49.866
What do you mean?

23
00:00:49.866 --> 00:00:50.866
Could it be that you want to say

24
00:00:50.866 --> 00:00:52.766
All his previous works were plagiarism

25
00:00:52.766 --> 00:00:53.566
yours

26
00:00:54.366 --> 00:00:56.500
Since the leader wants to see

27
00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.600
Then show him all my work

28
00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.400
You also let him die

29
00:01:05.666 --> 00:01:06.933
Warm historical works

30
00:01:06.933 --> 00:01:08.900
It's all plagiarized from my previous design drafts

31
00:01:09.333 --> 00:01:11.900
No wonder such an empty-headed lady

32
00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:14.300
Can easily become the design supervisor of Yan's Group

33
00:01:17.466 --> 00:01:18.900
He dares to shoot me so fearlessly

34
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:19.800
historical works

35
00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:20.533
It's confidence.

36
00:01:20.533 --> 00:01:21.900
No one will believe you

37
00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:25.200
Now he and everyone else believe in him

38
00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:26.566
Even if I explain

39
00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.633
It will only be regarded as a quibble

40
00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.966
It's better to have nothing to say

41
00:01:32.533 --> 00:01:35.366
Leader, if I can prove that I am not plagiarizing

42
00:01:35.366 --> 00:01:37.666
Will you be fair and objective and return my innocence?

43
00:01:37.666 --> 00:01:39.866
And allow me to participate in this competition

44
00:01:40.166 --> 00:01:41.633
It's not that you plagiarized

45
00:01:41.666 --> 00:01:43.166
That is Gu Nuannuan plagiarizing

46
00:01:43.166 --> 00:01:45.333
Then all his previous works are also plagiarized

47
00:01:45.333 --> 00:01:46.366
yours

48
00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.500
I still say that

49
00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.100
Everything depends on strength

50
00:01:52.333 --> 00:01:53.866
If you can prove yourself

51
00:01:53.866 --> 00:01:56.066
I will not forgive any plagiarist

52
00:01:56.933 --> 00:01:58.366
Today at 2pm.

53
00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:59.466
The competition officially opened

54
00:01:59.466 --> 00:02:00.100
start

55
00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:02.266
If you can't prove yourself before then

56
00:02:02.266 --> 00:02:03.466
You will resign

57
00:02:03.566 --> 00:02:05.400
And never set foot in the design world
