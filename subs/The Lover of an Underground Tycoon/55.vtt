00:00:01.266 --> 00:00:02.933
He never graduated from a high school

2
00:00:02.933 --> 00:00:04.233
What do you know about design?

3
00:00:04.566 --> 00:00:06.866
Maybe it's all imitating me

4
00:00:07.133 --> 00:00:08.366
So you admit

5
00:00:08.466 --> 00:00:10.700
These designs are all original to me

6
00:00:10.966 --> 00:00:12.033
A bad imitation

7
00:00:12.766 --> 00:00:14.666
But your historical works are all in these clumsy

8
00:00:14.666 --> 00:00:15.766
In poor imitation

9
00:00:16.566 --> 00:00:18.300
What, Linda?

10
00:00:18.566 --> 00:00:19.200
This is me from

11
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.366
All the design works since high school

12
00:00:21.366 --> 00:00:23.066
Each page is dated

13
00:00:23.133 --> 00:00:24.466
You can flip it back.

14
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.466
Gu Nuannuan's historical works

15
00:00:26.533 --> 00:00:28.200
It's all in these sketches.

16
00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:30.800
God, aren't these warm works?

17
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.100
How could it be in Gu Qingqing's portfolio?

18
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.433
Is it really Gu Qingqing who Sister Nuannuan plagiarized?

19
00:00:36.133 --> 00:00:38.066
Don't be deceived by Gu Qingqing

20
00:00:38.066 --> 00:00:41.000
He can copy me once, he can copy me twice

21
00:00:41.133 --> 00:00:42.000
maybe

22
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.266
His later works were also plagiarized from me

23
00:00:45.566 --> 00:00:48.566
Okay, since you said that Gu Qingqing copied you

24
00:00:48.566 --> 00:00:50.100
Then please explain

25
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.866
Why is your new product for the next quarter?

26
00:00:51.866 --> 00:00:53.466
Also in Gu Qingqing's portfolio

27
00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.200
And his first draft was dated a year ago

28
00:00:57.266 --> 00:00:59.066
Could it be that he would predict

29
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.900
Previous works, who knows who borrowed from whom?

30
00:01:02.133 --> 00:01:02.766
and

31
00:01:02.766 --> 00:01:05.266
Shouldn't the focus of this competition be on the design draft?

32
00:01:05.266 --> 00:01:06.333
I solemnly declare

33
00:01:06.333 --> 00:01:08.600
The design draft this time is my own original

34
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.433
Everything requires evidence

35
00:01:10.533 --> 00:01:12.366
It shouldn't be because of his one-sided words

36
00:01:12.733 --> 00:01:15.100
I plagiarized this subjective paragraph from him
