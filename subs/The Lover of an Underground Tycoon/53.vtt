00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:06.233
Fu Nuannuan, you plagiarize

2
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.233
What plagiarism?

3
00:00:12.366 --> 00:00:13.433
How is that possible?

4
00:00:13.533 --> 00:00:15.466
Plagiarism should be the most intolerable

5
00:00:21.266 --> 00:00:22.866
Gu Jingjing, what are you crazy about?

6
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.166
You set me up

7
00:00:26.366 --> 00:00:29.400
Whether it is dirty or not should not be spoken with evidence

8
00:00:32.933 --> 00:00:33.733
Linda

9
00:00:33.766 --> 00:00:35.700
I don't know if what you said still counts

10
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.866
As long as I can prove that I didn't plagiarize.

11
00:00:37.966 --> 00:00:39.800
You will treat me fairly

12
00:00:40.533 --> 00:00:42.866
Of course, I won't let any plagiarism go.

13
00:00:43.166 --> 00:00:45.133
That's right, character comes first

14
00:00:45.133 --> 00:00:47.700
Whoever plagiarizes will be expelled from the design circle forever

15
00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:49.400
He is slandering me

16
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:51.866
before love

17
00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:54.600
You see there is evidence

18
00:00:55.333 --> 00:00:56.566
Of course there is evidence
