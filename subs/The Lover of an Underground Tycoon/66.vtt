00:00:00.566 --> 00:00:01.566
Who are you?

2
00:00:02.733 --> 00:00:04.533
I have already sold this jade pendant.

3
00:00:04.533 --> 00:00:05.866
How is it in your hands?

4
00:00:05.866 --> 00:00:08.100
This is the token that our Mr. Yan left to the savior

5
00:00:10.466 --> 00:00:11.433
Yan Shixing

6
00:00:12.566 --> 00:00:14.466
This jade pendant belongs to my eldest daughter

7
00:00:14.466 --> 00:00:17.666
But how did he become Mr. Yan's benefactor?

8
00:00:17.666 --> 00:00:19.866
Was he at the Star Hotel five years ago?

9
00:00:20.466 --> 00:00:21.766
Yes, yes.

10
00:00:22.533 --> 00:00:25.200
It's just that he kept crying when he came back from the hotel

11
00:00:25.466 --> 00:00:26.100
That's right.

12
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:27.466
It's our president who's sorry for him.

13
00:00:27.466 --> 00:00:28.800
Let him come back now

14
00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:31.700
Okay, okay, I'll call him back right away

15
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:35.066
So five years ago

16
00:00:35.066 --> 00:00:37.533
The wild man who fooled around with the past is now

17
00:00:37.533 --> 00:00:38.400
real essence

18
00:00:38.466 --> 00:00:41.100
Talk to us with respect

19
00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.366
The child he gave birth to

20
00:00:45.766 --> 00:00:48.066
It must be the little prince of the Yan family

21
00:00:48.066 --> 00:00:49.333
What a pity!

22
00:00:49.333 --> 00:00:50.866
If the child hadn't died

23
00:00:51.133 --> 00:00:53.400
We can move on to the comeback

24
00:00:53.666 --> 00:00:55.500
Who said that child was dead?

25
00:00:55.966 --> 00:00:56.966
Pardon me?

26
00:00:57.666 --> 00:00:59.766
That child didn't die at all

27
00:00:59.766 --> 00:01:02.700
I was just looking for an excuse to throw him away

28
00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:04.266
You threw him away?

29
00:01:04.266 --> 00:01:06.166
That's a world-weary child

30
00:01:06.166 --> 00:01:09.300
How did I know at that time that he was a child of a world-weary minister?

31
00:01:09.366 --> 00:01:11.366
Don't worry, husband.

32
00:01:11.866 --> 00:01:13.200
I already thought

33
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.433
Let's take care of our family and turn around

34
00:01:15.866 --> 00:01:17.033
Not only can you turn over

35
00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.100
You can also become the in-laws of the Yan family

36
00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.166
How?

37
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.800
Okay, let's do it.
