00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:01.200
green

2
00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:07.133
Manager Zhu, it's all my fault

3
00:00:07.133 --> 00:00:08.700
I shouldn't have ignored you

4
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.600
I shouldn't refuse your offer

5
00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:12.366
I was really wrong.

6
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.233
Please forgive me.

7
00:00:14.366 --> 00:00:17.166
I finally found an honest man to marry this time

8
00:00:17.166 --> 00:00:18.966
If he really listened to you

9
00:00:18.966 --> 00:00:20.166
Kicked me

10
00:00:20.166 --> 00:00:21.900
Then what can I do?

11
00:00:21.933 --> 00:00:23.333
I know wrong.

12
00:00:23.333 --> 00:00:25.900
I know, you have a lot of adults

13
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:27.666
Forgive me this time

14
00:00:27.733 --> 00:00:29.766
Manager Zhu, don't be deceived by him

15
00:00:29.766 --> 00:00:31.900
He is definitely not Chenxing Xingxing and will give you points.

16
00:00:34.766 --> 00:00:37.866
Tell me how the money came

17
00:00:39.733 --> 00:00:42.866
Manager Zhu, I am a girl

18
00:00:42.866 --> 00:00:44.833
Fame is important.

19
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.300
Your words

20
00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.633
I'm obviously chatting normally with guests

21
00:00:48.666 --> 00:00:50.400
You call me a promiscuous person.

22
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.433
How can I survive in Yuncheng from now on?

23
00:00:54.266 --> 00:00:56.366
As long as you help me clear up the rumors

24
00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.466
I will apologize as much as you want me to apologize

25
00:01:00.966 --> 00:01:04.866
Oh, isn't it right to be so soft?

26
00:01:04.866 --> 00:01:08.633
You know how tiring it is to lose a few surveillance screenshots.

27
00:01:09.066 --> 00:01:10.866
Still have to find a good angle?

28
00:01:10.866 --> 00:01:12.433
Hahaha

29
00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:14.433
So

30
00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.866
These rumors and surveillance are really from you

31
00:01:17.866 --> 00:01:19.466
For me

32
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.466
Want to destroy someone

33
00:01:21.533 --> 00:01:24.166
How simple and easy is that?

34
00:01:28.166 --> 00:01:30.366
Was it actually recorded?

35
00:01:30.533 --> 00:01:33.100
It's all recorded, you ask slander

36
00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:34.266
Defamation of employees

37
00:01:34.266 --> 00:01:35.800
Attracting harassment to employees

38
00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:37.600
What other crimes?

39
00:01:37.933 --> 00:01:40.200
You go and make it clear to the police yourself.

40
00:01:40.866 --> 00:01:43.100
Are you plotting against me?

41
00:01:43.333 --> 00:01:44.366
Give me the phone

42
00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.700
Hey, salute, salute
