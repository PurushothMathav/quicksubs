00:00:02.066 --> 00:00:03.166
How can I get back?

2
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:03.900
I don't know.

3
00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:04.933
This level of boss

4
00:00:04.933 --> 00:00:06.533
I've only seen it at staff meetings

5
00:00:06.533 --> 00:00:08.200
But walk around

6
00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:11.400
Are you all right?

7
00:00:12.166 --> 00:00:12.966
Yeah.

8
00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:16.833
So he is the legendary richest man.

9
00:00:16.966 --> 00:00:19.233
I didn't expect to be so young

10
00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.200
Is it in your hand?

11
00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:25.700
Mr. Yan Gu Qingqing is a new employee of the company

12
00:00:25.933 --> 00:00:27.400
He is a warm-hearted

13
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.166
He took the initiative to do these things

14
00:00:30.166 --> 00:00:31.366
Is it Gu Qingqing?

15
00:00:35.966 --> 00:00:36.766
I want to

16
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.600
Yes, Yan, I always have to mop the floor myself

17
00:00:44.533 --> 00:00:46.266
Since you have decided to stay in the Yan room

18
00:00:46.466 --> 00:00:48.900
Then it's better not to splash your face with the girl's warm silk

19
00:00:49.166 --> 00:00:51.166
After all, she is the head of the design department

20
00:00:51.366 --> 00:00:52.166
Besides

21
00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:54.866
And that's not going to take the heat out.

22
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.533
It's better to sell him face

23
00:00:56.533 --> 00:00:58.966
The group hired you to do the design

24
00:00:58.966 --> 00:01:00.466
It's not useless.

25
00:01:01.166 --> 00:01:02.566
As a supervisor

26
00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.033
If you don't know how to allocate manpower

27
00:01:05.266 --> 00:01:06.600
You've got to think wrong.

28
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:07.800
Sorry Mr. Yan

29
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:08.700
This is not an example.

30
00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:10.100
I will

31
00:01:10.266 --> 00:01:12.500
I will definitely not let Gu Qing open these activities again.

32
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.733
Ah, I'm sorry.

33
00:01:16.733 --> 00:01:18.166
I was hungry.

34
00:01:20.933 --> 00:01:21.900
And I didn't either.

35
00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.800
Let's do it together.

36
00:01:26.733 --> 00:01:29.300
Hurry up and follow!

37
00:01:31.666 --> 00:01:33.000
Damn father dear

38
00:01:33.166 --> 00:01:34.766
Make me lose face in front of swallows

39
00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.266
I will never let you go.
