00:00:01.166 --> 00:00:01.966
Mr. Yan

2
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:11.400
What are you going to do to my new employee?

3
00:00:11.466 --> 00:00:12.866
Ye Nuo, how could this be misunderstood?

4
00:00:12.866 --> 00:00:13.766
It's all a misunderstanding

5
00:00:13.766 --> 00:00:15.066
Mr. Jin is free of charge.

6
00:00:15.066 --> 00:00:17.600
Tell me what happened for free

7
00:00:17.933 --> 00:00:20.433
The deputy supervisor said today is Yinxin Rice

8
00:00:20.566 --> 00:00:21.900
But want me to pay

9
00:00:22.066 --> 00:00:23.266
I don't have any money.

10
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.066
You have to take my clothes to offset the bill.

11
00:00:25.866 --> 00:00:27.833
Yan's Group's Welcome Rice

12
00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:30.233
When do new employees need to pay?

13
00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:32.833
No, Mr. Yan

14
00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:34.200
Yan's Group regulations

15
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.466
The welcome meal will be reimbursed by the department head.

16
00:00:36.466 --> 00:00:38.100
Limit 10,000 yuan per meal

17
00:00:38.333 --> 00:00:39.966
As a department head

18
00:00:40.166 --> 00:00:42.200
Since you don't know the rules of the company so well

19
00:00:42.666 --> 00:00:43.800
Then don't fight

20
00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.000
No, Mr. Yan

21
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:46.866
employer management

22
00:00:46.866 --> 00:00:49.866
The welcome meal will be reimbursed 10,000 yuan by the company

23
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.433
Please subsidize the rest yourself.

24
00:00:52.666 --> 00:00:54.000
From tomorrow.

25
00:00:54.133 --> 00:00:56.166
You are no longer the department head

26
00:00:59.733 --> 00:01:01.200
Gu Qingxin, this bitch

27
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:04.500
Only worthy of that poor and ugly migrant worker

28
00:01:04.766 --> 00:01:06.966
Phoenix among dragons like Mr. Yan

29
00:01:07.266 --> 00:01:08.900
Only I deserve it

30
00:01:11.866 --> 00:01:15.066
You are drunk, I will take you home, not drunk

31
00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.766
You see, you can't even walk steadily, and you say you're not guilty

32
00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.066
I can so that.

33
00:01:23.466 --> 00:01:25.233
Go to Mr. Li Yan

34
00:01:25.666 --> 00:01:26.866
What is this?

35
00:01:26.933 --> 00:01:28.633
I have a husband

36
00:01:28.766 --> 00:01:30.666
I'll take you home.

37
00:01:31.266 --> 00:01:32.066
No.

38
00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.200
No, hurry in
