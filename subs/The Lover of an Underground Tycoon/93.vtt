00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:01.600
You don't get married well

2
00:00:01.666 --> 00:00:03.033
What would you like to do for me?

3
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:22.000
Suddenly out of breath

4
00:00:29.933 --> 00:00:32.200
I didn't expect you to cry too.

5
00:00:40.733 --> 00:00:41.533
Kiki

6
00:00:41.933 --> 00:00:43.100
What's your trouble?

7
00:00:44.933 --> 00:00:47.200
Senior, I still can't let him go

8
00:00:47.266 --> 00:00:50.233
I want to fight for myself one last time

9
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.066
Sorry senior

10
00:00:52.333 --> 00:00:55.866
I'm going to miss another appointment, so I've made up my mind

11
00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:57.966
Sure enough

12
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.300
You're still the same

13
00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:01.966
Don't hit the south wall and don't look back

14
00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.200
So be it.

15
00:01:04.566 --> 00:01:07.233
Let me know when you can't hold on any longer

16
00:01:08.066 --> 00:01:09.266
I'll pick you up.

17
00:01:09.733 --> 00:01:10.966
Thank you, sir.

18
00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.366
You deserve better

19
00:01:12.366 --> 00:01:15.033
Don't wait for me, I'd love to

20
00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.766
Well, it's my degree anyway

21
00:01:21.266 --> 00:01:22.066
Gone

22
00:01:33.766 --> 00:01:35.266
Welcome back the CEO

23
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:37.800
Mr. Yan

24
00:01:37.866 --> 00:01:40.200
I have suffered so much during this time

25
00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.666
What's more, Miss Gu?

26
00:01:41.933 --> 00:01:44.000
You must seek justice for us.

27
00:01:44.966 --> 00:01:47.833
Well, go back and get justice
