00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:02.600
Who is the world-weary minister?

2
00:00:02.666 --> 00:00:04.066
The richest man in the morning

3
00:00:04.066 --> 00:00:05.766
The kind that makes it to Forbes

4
00:00:06.066 --> 00:00:08.800
He and I are not in the same circle at all

5
00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:12.766
Whether it is the three-view background or the social circle level

6
00:00:13.133 --> 00:00:14.633
It's not the same world.

7
00:00:14.966 --> 00:00:17.533
How can such a relationship last long?

8
00:00:17.533 --> 00:00:19.900
I still have this self-knowledge

9
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.033
actually

10
00:00:22.966 --> 00:00:23.966
Not necessarily.

11
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.600
Actually, don't feel inferior

12
00:00:27.733 --> 00:00:30.200
How many misanthropes are there in this world?

13
00:00:30.333 --> 00:00:32.100
Lots of ordinary people like us

14
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:34.533
I believe that as long as we work hard

15
00:00:34.533 --> 00:00:36.166
You must be able to live a good life

16
00:00:36.566 --> 00:00:38.966
There will be no sadness.

17
00:00:39.533 --> 00:00:42.100
Fortunately, we are company

18
00:00:49.766 --> 00:00:52.866
Mr. Yan, you have watched the issue 28 times in one morning

19
00:00:52.866 --> 00:00:55.166
Have you never been so torn about the cooperation of hundreds of millions?

20
00:00:55.166 --> 00:00:56.133
Can it be the same?

21
00:00:56.133 --> 00:00:58.300
This is about a future I can't pay off

22
00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:01.900
If you want me to say, you should have told the lady earlier

23
00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:04.100
The longer it drags on, the harder it is to end

24
00:01:06.766 --> 00:01:09.066
But he said that yesterday.

25
00:01:09.366 --> 00:01:10.833
If I tell him

26
00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.033
What if he doesn't get a divorce?

27
00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.066
This is the long-winded strap

28
00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:18.400
Who asked you to dress up like that to go on a blind date?

29
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.566
I came to you today to ask you to give me advice

30
00:01:21.566 --> 00:01:24.000
I'm not here for you to talk to me

31
00:01:24.866 --> 00:01:25.666
Okay.

32
00:01:27.066 --> 00:01:28.633
I have an idea

33
00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:31.000
What!

34
00:01:32.066 --> 00:01:34.933
Since your wife will choose you as president

35
00:01:34.933 --> 00:01:37.533
Why don't you give me the position of president?

36
00:01:37.533 --> 00:01:39.433
You don't deserve a lady

37
00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.600
Xiao Zhang, what's wrong with you recently?

38
00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.633
See if you are not in the state recently.

39
00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:56.766
Sister Nan Nan, I

40
00:01:57.766 --> 00:02:00.600
If there is anything, just tell me.

41
00:02:00.766 --> 00:02:03.366
This competition is also Linna's assessment of us.

42
00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.366
If I were the last in the company

43
00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.466
Will definitely be fired

44
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.566
But my mom is still in the ICU.

45
00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:11.233
Requires a lot of money

46
00:02:11.533 --> 00:02:13.300
I can't live without this job

47
00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:17.733
How can you be the last one with such strength?

48
00:02:17.733 --> 00:02:18.666
Besides

49
00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.266
Isn't there Gu Qingqing at the bottom?

50
00:02:22.333 --> 00:02:23.166
Gu Qingqing

51
00:02:24.566 --> 00:02:26.433
Gu Qingqing's backstage is so hard

52
00:02:26.666 --> 00:02:27.966
He will definitely be kept.

53
00:02:28.566 --> 00:02:30.666
Then disqualify him

54
00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.200
That won't threaten you
