00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:05.100
I'm sure I'm not mistaken about the file.

2
00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:06.500
If you don't believe me

3
00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:08.200
Access to office monitoring

4
00:00:09.766 --> 00:00:10.866
Who do you think you are?

5
00:00:10.866 --> 00:00:12.100
Worth the company's big move cylinder pavilion

6
00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:14.866
Monitoring is a waste of resources

7
00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:16.400
But Gu Qingqing

8
00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:17.966
There is no shame in doing wrong

9
00:00:17.966 --> 00:00:20.166
It is shameful that you have made a mistake and still do not repent

10
00:00:20.166 --> 00:00:22.000
If you run errands, you don't understand

11
00:00:22.366 --> 00:00:23.833
Then go to the office

12
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:25.633
Clean up

13
00:00:27.666 --> 00:00:28.900
What are you still doing?

14
00:00:28.966 --> 00:00:30.300
Diploma No Diploma

15
00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:31.900
Ability but not ability

16
00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:33.833
Don't say you can't mop the floor.

17
00:00:33.966 --> 00:00:36.833
Our design department does not raise idle people

18
00:00:37.466 --> 00:00:39.733
Gu Nuannuan, I am applying as a designer

19
00:00:39.733 --> 00:00:41.066
Not some handyman

20
00:00:41.333 --> 00:00:43.166
If you ask me to do design-related work

21
00:00:43.166 --> 00:00:44.433
I can say nothing.

22
00:00:44.733 --> 00:00:46.633
But but what but

23
00:00:47.333 --> 00:00:48.500
As a subordinate

24
00:00:48.533 --> 00:00:50.666
You should obey all orders of the leader

25
00:00:50.966 --> 00:00:52.366
If you don't want to do it

26
00:00:52.466 --> 00:00:53.866
There are people out there

27
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.800
Do you think the design department has to be you?

28
00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.266
Lots of master's students out there

29
00:00:58.266 --> 00:01:00.833
Graduate students can't even get in

30
00:01:01.166 --> 00:01:03.533
What do you compare with others with a high school degree?

31
00:01:03.533 --> 00:01:05.600
I can't even do this chores now

32
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.300
Still picking and choosing

33
00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:08.900
This feels wronged

34
00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:10.500
The company hired you to work

35
00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:11.733
I don't want you to be a big Buddha

36
00:01:11.733 --> 00:01:13.900
If you can't stand the grievance, get out as soon as possible

37
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.866
Grandma still has a lot of money for follow-up rehabilitation

38
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.900
Yan's Group is the company with the highest salaries in the industry

39
00:01:21.166 --> 00:01:22.633
Don't let this opportunity pass you by.

40
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.166
The employer cares. I just had a bad attitude.

41
00:01:26.333 --> 00:01:27.266
Don't worry.

42
00:01:27.266 --> 00:01:29.700
I promise to mop the floor clean

43
00:01:30.933 --> 00:01:31.966
Is that right?

44
00:01:31.966 --> 00:01:34.866
As a subordinate, you should have the attitude of a subordinate

45
00:01:36.366 --> 00:01:38.000
Clean it up

46
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.700
If there is a hair under the ground

47
00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.033
Don't want this month's salary.
