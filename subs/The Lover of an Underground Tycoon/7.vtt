00:00:00.466 --> 00:00:02.400
Actually, I got lucky

2
00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:04.766
Dr. Chen Sheng, a national treasure brain expert

3
00:00:04.766 --> 00:00:06.366
He's coming to see my grandmother.

4
00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:09.600
Do you know that his number is hard to come by?

5
00:00:09.666 --> 00:00:12.333
The appointments with him are all lined up until the year after tomorrow

6
00:00:12.333 --> 00:00:13.200
Let him do it

7
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.033
Grandma will be fine soon

8
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.766
The luck is really good.

9
00:00:18.766 --> 00:00:20.700
I want to share my good luck with you

10
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:22.200
So you can get promoted sooner

11
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:23.900
No need to move bricks on the construction site

12
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.100
To borrow my wife to quit smoking

13
00:00:28.966 --> 00:00:30.266
Long to come

14
00:00:30.366 --> 00:00:31.766
I can check slowly

15
00:00:31.766 --> 00:00:34.033
Is he the man I'm looking for?

16
00:00:39.333 --> 00:00:40.866
When grandma is healed

17
00:00:40.866 --> 00:00:44.266
I'll take her back to my hometown for a while and then

18
00:00:47.066 --> 00:00:48.400
Hello Jingjing

19
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.300
You married another man without telling your family?

20
00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.666
You are now Mr. He's fiancee

21
00:00:53.733 --> 00:00:56.066
If you let him know, he will die

22
00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.933
I said I wouldn't marry Mr. He

23
00:00:58.933 --> 00:00:59.800
Who loves to marry?

24
00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:00.900
Leave me alone

25
00:01:05.266 --> 00:01:06.066
Hello

26
00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:08.600
This Nini

27
00:01:09.266 --> 00:01:10.666
Hang up on me

28
00:01:11.533 --> 00:01:13.366
Don't do anything wrong

29
00:01:13.366 --> 00:01:16.466
Otherwise the 5 million will be gone

30
00:01:16.866 --> 00:01:19.233
Don't worry, Hua

31
00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:20.400
Don't you forget.

32
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.566
The immortal is still in our hands

33
00:01:22.566 --> 00:01:24.766
Are you still afraid that Gu Qingqing will not obey?
