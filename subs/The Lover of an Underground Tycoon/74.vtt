00:00:01.466 --> 00:00:03.366
My relationship with today is getting better

2
00:00:03.366 --> 00:00:05.033
Don't tell him yet

3
00:00:05.166 --> 00:00:08.000
I'll tell him when I solve the indecent thing.

4
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.900
Ah, I was just thinking

5
00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:13.033
Where should we hold our wedding?

6
00:00:14.166 --> 00:00:15.400
You be serious

7
00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:16.966
What's wrong?

8
00:00:16.966 --> 00:00:18.333
We've all been certified for so long

9
00:00:18.333 --> 00:00:20.700
It's time to put the wedding on the agenda

10
00:00:21.366 --> 00:00:24.700
But your mother, he doesn't have it yet, don't worry about him.

11
00:00:24.966 --> 00:00:26.300
Grandma likes you

12
00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:31.800
I know I can't change my past

13
00:00:31.866 --> 00:00:33.900
But I can work hard for my future.

14
00:00:34.133 --> 00:00:35.500
I've made up my mind.

15
00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.466
I'm going to use the prize money from this contest

16
00:00:37.466 --> 00:00:39.033
Open a personal studio

17
00:00:39.166 --> 00:00:40.200
Thanks to the competition

18
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.100
I've got a lot of reservations already

19
00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:43.666
So I'm going to chase after it

20
00:00:43.666 --> 00:00:45.100
Make a name for yourself

21
00:00:45.266 --> 00:00:47.533
I believe that through my efforts

22
00:00:47.533 --> 00:00:49.300
One day I will be worthy of you

23
00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.700
Your mother will change his mind about me too

24
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.066
You were always worthy of me

25
00:00:54.666 --> 00:00:56.166
Hey, but listen to what you mean

26
00:00:56.166 --> 00:00:57.966
You plan to resign from our anorexia

27
00:00:57.966 --> 00:00:59.166
Then start your own business

28
00:01:00.366 --> 00:01:01.700
Something like that.

29
00:01:02.066 --> 00:01:03.566
You just got first place.

30
00:01:03.566 --> 00:01:05.600
You think we are small

31
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.300
No, it's not.

32
00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.833
I know because of all kinds of things

33
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.000
No one in the company likes me

34
00:01:13.333 --> 00:01:15.700
And now they know I'm your wife

35
00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.666
There must be a lot of rumors

36
00:01:17.666 --> 00:01:19.433
I just wanted to focus on design.

37
00:01:19.766 --> 00:01:21.000
But here's the thing.

38
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.633
The interview group does not allow office links.

39
00:01:23.966 --> 00:01:25.833
So I took the initiative to resign

40
00:01:25.966 --> 00:01:28.966
Lest President Yanda try the law himself

41
00:01:29.533 --> 00:01:31.033
There is also this rule in the company

42
00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.033
It's in the new employee handbook

43
00:01:33.166 --> 00:01:35.400
Then I'll cripple him right away, no

44
00:01:35.666 --> 00:01:36.533
In that case

45
00:01:36.533 --> 00:01:39.033
They're going to say I'm a goblin who bewitched you again

46
00:01:42.466 --> 00:01:43.833
Yes, it is.

47
00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:45.466
You be serious

48
00:01:45.466 --> 00:01:46.666
Do you agree?

49
00:01:50.266 --> 00:01:52.900
You don't need to go through my pain to do anything you want.

50
00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:55.966
And your dream is to become a family legend

51
00:01:55.966 --> 00:01:57.200
Well-known designer

52
00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.166
Support all your decisions

53
00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.400
That's it.

54
00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:02.833
I will quit my job tomorrow.

55
00:02:02.866 --> 00:02:04.233
Don't be angry!

56
00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.400
Then I'll come to see the studio now

57
00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:08.200
address

58
00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:09.833
What are you doing?

59
00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.866
Let's talk about work tomorrow

60
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.266
It's couple time
