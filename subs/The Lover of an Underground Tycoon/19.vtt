00:00:00.466 --> 00:00:02.300
It's actually fine

2
00:00:03.133 --> 00:00:04.400
Are you out of your mind?

3
00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:07.000
This is 5 million not $500

4
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.266
Hmph, hit the swollen face and make the fat man

5
00:00:09.266 --> 00:00:12.666
I don't think you even have 500 yuan in this card, right?

6
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.233
People who can't pay are not qualified to speak

7
00:00:17.266 --> 00:00:20.066
Are you sure this card has 5 million

8
00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.366
Have you 5 million you will know if you brush it?

9
00:00:23.366 --> 00:00:24.966
Actually, don't make a fuss.

10
00:00:24.966 --> 00:00:27.700
I don't want these clothes, you go

11
00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:31.000
Hi, what's the hurry?

12
00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:33.800
Since your husband is going to spend a lot of money on you

13
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:36.000
You should give him a chance to perform

14
00:00:37.166 --> 00:00:39.466
Your husband wants to buy this dress professionally.

15
00:00:40.066 --> 00:00:41.600
If you can't pay

16
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.233
But for those of us who have been delayed

17
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.033
Kneel down and apologize

18
00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:47.366
Exactly.

19
00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:49.700
You don't just have to kneel and apologize

20
00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:53.366
And lick all the places you've stepped on

21
00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:54.966
Don't go too far

22
00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:57.266
What if I could afford it?

23
00:00:57.733 --> 00:00:59.300
If you can afford it

24
00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.500
I'm eating shit live on the spot now

25
00:01:03.066 --> 00:01:05.500
Remember what you said and swipe

26
00:01:14.333 --> 00:01:15.866
Is this machine broken?
