00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:03.466
Is this machine broken?

2
00:00:03.933 --> 00:00:04.733
This

3
00:00:04.766 --> 00:00:07.933
Baileys Mall is the top facility in everything

4
00:00:07.933 --> 00:00:09.300
How could it be broken?

5
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:12.033
Mr. Qin

6
00:00:12.666 --> 00:00:14.266
Please keep your card.

7
00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:18.300
You will be a VIP customer in the future.

8
00:00:20.666 --> 00:00:22.066
Live stream eats shit

9
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:25.400
Forget it, it's too smelly

10
00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:26.900
Will smoke my wife

11
00:00:28.133 --> 00:00:31.000
Is it an apology to my wife or a promise?

12
00:00:31.133 --> 00:00:32.300
Choose for yourself

13
00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:33.866
Want me to apologize to Gu Qingqing

14
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:34.966
That's not possible.

15
00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:36.966
No apology

16
00:00:37.766 --> 00:00:38.800
Then

17
00:00:42.766 --> 00:00:44.400
Han Shao, why did you hit me?

18
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.000
Obviously they shut up for me

19
00:00:46.933 --> 00:00:48.400
It's all your fault

20
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:50.966
Sorry.

21
00:00:53.366 --> 00:00:55.166
Guo Jingjing, wait for me

22
00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:57.766
Sorry sir

23
00:00:57.766 --> 00:00:59.966
I was blind to Mount Tai before

24
00:00:59.966 --> 00:01:01.533
Please have a lot.

25
00:01:01.533 --> 00:01:04.233
Don't bother with me, a poor migrant worker

26
00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:06.600
And?

27
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.166
Sorry, Miss.

28
00:01:09.166 --> 00:01:10.366
It's my bad attitude.

29
00:01:10.366 --> 00:01:11.566
I know wrong

30
00:01:11.566 --> 00:01:14.266
Please forgive my wife

31
00:01:14.333 --> 00:01:15.666
Forgive him?

32
00:01:15.666 --> 00:01:16.466
OK

33
00:01:17.533 --> 00:01:19.166
Since my wife doesn't care about you

34
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.400
Then I won't pursue it.

35
00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:22.766
But remember your attitude

36
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.466
The visitor is a guest

37
00:01:24.666 --> 00:01:27.566
Yes, yes, yes, I must listen to Mr.'s education

38
00:01:27.566 --> 00:01:28.433
Learning lessons

39
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.200
Here we go.

40
00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.100
In fact, where did you get so much money?

41
00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:39.800
Could it be
