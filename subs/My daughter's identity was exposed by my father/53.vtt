00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.300
Must be wrong

2
00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:04.200
This is the daughter of the night market group

3
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.866
So he is a countryman.

4
00:00:06.866 --> 00:00:08.866
It's not his right

5
00:00:09.533 --> 00:00:11.033
I am the daughter of the night market

6
00:00:11.166 --> 00:00:11.966
Ye Meng

7
00:00:12.266 --> 00:00:15.166
You were fired for using my identity at the company first

8
00:00:15.166 --> 00:00:17.733
Then he pretended to owe usury

9
00:00:17.733 --> 00:00:20.366
Now do you still want to do it again?

10
00:00:20.466 --> 00:00:22.100
I don't understand what you're saying.

11
00:00:22.133 --> 00:00:23.866
I called my dad last night

12
00:00:23.866 --> 00:00:24.966
Said to accept Galway's

13
00:00:24.966 --> 00:00:26.200
The thief shouts to catch the thief

14
00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:29.500
You still dare to pretend in front of the daughter of the Ye family

15
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:31.066
Qiuyan now

16
00:00:31.066 --> 00:00:32.500
Not the time to change this

17
00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.200
Send them away quickly

18
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.966
Ouch hello lady

19
00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.700
We are blind to Mount Tai

20
00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:42.700
You see, Miss, you have admitted it wrong.

21
00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:43.933
You stupid dog

22
00:00:43.933 --> 00:00:45.533
Don't you even know your own master?

23
00:00:45.533 --> 00:00:48.900
But you stupid things, go away

24
00:00:55.933 --> 00:00:57.266
I am the daughter of the Ye family

25
00:00:57.266 --> 00:00:58.666
He's an impostor.

26
00:00:59.866 --> 00:01:01.000
You bitch

27
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.333
My son almost had his hand chopped off

28
00:01:03.333 --> 00:01:04.600
Now dare to frame the dream

29
00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.333
I see you really don't want to live anymore

30
00:01:06.333 --> 00:01:08.833
I don't have a loan shark that I didn't borrow

31
00:01:08.966 --> 00:01:11.700
It's Aowei Financial that I just called to acquire.

32
00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.300
Don't talk big

33
00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:14.166
Zhiyuan

34
00:01:14.566 --> 00:01:17.066
Tell him why you brought him here this time

35
00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.300
Zhiran, what does he mean?

36
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.766
Jiu Ye, let's break up

37
00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.033
You came to me today

38
00:01:27.766 --> 00:01:29.366
Just tell me this

39
00:01:30.666 --> 00:01:33.566
Why can people still dream?

40
00:01:33.566 --> 00:01:35.300
People are kind and rich

41
00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:37.300
Not like you are full of bad water

42
00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.366
Still a hillbilly who can't get on the table

43
00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.566
Even a pig knows how to choose, so

44
00:01:43.933 --> 00:01:45.266
It's for him.

45
00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.433
Broke up with me early
