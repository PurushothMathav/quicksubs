00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:01.866
Do you know what stupid thing you did?

2
00:00:01.866 --> 00:00:03.533
I'm stupid Ye Qiuyan

3
00:00:03.533 --> 00:00:05.733
Can you put yourself in the right position?

4
00:00:05.733 --> 00:00:08.200
Come to my house to work and dare to yell at me

5
00:00:08.333 --> 00:00:11.600
Just a lowly cleaner

6
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:14.866
What's the matter, you asked your dad to wake us up?

7
00:00:14.866 --> 00:00:17.066
Ouch, I'm so scared.

8
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.500
The poor man put it together

9
00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:19.866
That's deadly.

10
00:00:19.866 --> 00:00:22.466
Weren't you pretty awesome when it was listed just now?

11
00:00:22.466 --> 00:00:24.966
Why did you become the most despicable in such a short time?

12
00:00:24.966 --> 00:00:26.700
The little cleaner

13
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.500
I'm not here to clean. How did you get in?

14
00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.700
Ouch, it can't be a thief, can it?

15
00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:33.900
Just don't shout

16
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:36.433
I also want to ask you how you got in

17
00:00:38.466 --> 00:00:40.500
Hahaha Ye Qiuyan

18
00:00:40.733 --> 00:00:43.000
Are you working stupid?

19
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.333
This is one of the properties in the night market

20
00:00:45.333 --> 00:00:47.166
He is the eldest lady of the Ye family

21
00:00:47.166 --> 00:00:48.900
Feel free to come

22
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:52.100
Strange how to act and play a full set

23
00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.900
Even the keys to my house are done

24
00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.566
Get out of here, didn't you say I'm a cleaner?

25
00:00:58.566 --> 00:01:00.666
Please settle the wages

26
00:01:00.666 --> 00:01:03.200
I'm not a family member who doesn't go out to work

27
00:01:03.366 --> 00:01:04.900
Ah, the cleaning fee.

28
00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.366
It's all calculated by our housekeeper.

29
00:01:07.366 --> 00:01:10.366
This little money is not enough to bother me

30
00:01:10.466 --> 00:01:12.566
When will the wages be paid?

31
00:01:12.566 --> 00:01:15.033
When will I leave you?

32
00:01:15.266 --> 00:01:16.666
Oh miss

33
00:01:16.666 --> 00:01:19.133
Don't be like him, a cleaner.

34
00:01:19.133 --> 00:01:20.800
He was not ashamed.

35
00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.000
Let him be.

36
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.400
Is that a later date?

37
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.900
Let him wait by the side

38
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.066
Watch us eat a big meal

39
00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.333
This is worthy of Yuncheng's asset number one

40
00:01:30.333 --> 00:01:34.033
The home of the richest man in Ye is too grand

41
00:01:34.166 --> 00:01:36.866
Be angry, it's worth it

42
00:01:36.866 --> 00:01:39.766
Miss, when are we having dinner?

43
00:01:39.766 --> 00:01:40.700
Yes, yes.

44
00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.066
I'm still waiting for the Manchu banquet
