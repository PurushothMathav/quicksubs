00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.566
Player, who are you with?

2
00:00:02.566 --> 00:00:05.400
Company colleagues, that company party, that elephant

3
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:06.266
just kidding

4
00:00:06.266 --> 00:00:07.833
Don't take me for a fool

5
00:00:08.066 --> 00:00:10.200
Are you kidding me to say such ambiguous words?

6
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.833
You mean you suspect me of cheating?

7
00:00:13.133 --> 00:00:15.166
When you accused me of not believing you

8
00:00:15.166 --> 00:00:16.800
Now you don't believe me?

9
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.000
Is it really a joke?

10
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.866
Forget it, just don't believe it.

11
00:00:20.866 --> 00:00:22.566
Sorry ok

12
00:00:22.566 --> 00:00:23.466
Let's get down to business

13
00:00:23.466 --> 00:00:25.300
We had a lot of misunderstandings that day.

14
00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:26.533
I want to find an opportunity

15
00:00:26.533 --> 00:00:28.733
Have a good chat with you and your aunt

16
00:00:28.733 --> 00:00:30.300
Tomorrow is my mom's birthday.

17
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.266
Let's go out for dinner together

18
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.400
Even if I break up, I will break up cleanly

19
00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:44.566
Why did Night Dream come?

20
00:00:44.566 --> 00:00:46.333
My mom likes you

21
00:00:46.333 --> 00:00:48.666
Have you considered my feelings?

22
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.600
Why don't you reflect on yourself

23
00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:51.600
Only content

24
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.833
Why don't you think about how to please my mother?

25
00:00:56.533 --> 00:00:57.766
It's my birthday!

26
00:00:57.766 --> 00:01:00.266
Some people are too embarrassed to lick their faces and come empty-handed

27
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.500
Since you're here, buy me a bracelet as a gift
