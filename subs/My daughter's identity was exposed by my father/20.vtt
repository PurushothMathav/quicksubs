00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.500
You were making a living here before, right?

2
00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:04.066
Be a waiter every day

3
00:00:04.066 --> 00:00:07.866
Seeing rich people order food is still pretending to be here with me?

4
00:00:07.933 --> 00:00:09.800
Is that so?

5
00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:11.500
Ye Qiuyan, you said

6
00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:12.966
Do you have to be very grateful?

7
00:00:12.966 --> 00:00:14.600
Thank you to our eldest lady

8
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:15.666
If not for him

9
00:00:15.666 --> 00:00:18.166
You said you were a former waiter

10
00:00:18.166 --> 00:00:20.466
How is it possible to eat at the table?

11
00:00:20.466 --> 00:00:23.000
My cousin makes me eat here every day

12
00:00:23.266 --> 00:00:25.166
Tired of eating thank you

13
00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.133
It cost you.

14
00:00:27.133 --> 00:00:28.933
I am a down payment

15
00:00:28.933 --> 00:00:31.400
I saved this money

16
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:32.966
Come down this time

17
00:00:32.966 --> 00:00:35.766
200,000 have to empty me for most of the night

18
00:00:35.766 --> 00:00:36.600
I sooner or later

19
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.066
To get it back from you scumbags

20
00:00:39.066 --> 00:00:41.966
Miss, you are a passenger here

21
00:00:41.966 --> 00:00:45.266
Who is that handsome guy at the door?

22
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.133
My cousin, the owner of this restaurant

23
00:00:48.133 --> 00:00:49.666
I've never seen it before.

24
00:00:49.666 --> 00:00:51.200
Look dressed

25
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:52.700
I guess it's new here

26
00:00:52.933 --> 00:00:55.966
Can you introduce me to him?

27
00:00:56.066 --> 00:00:58.066
See if he can like you

28
00:00:58.066 --> 00:00:59.300
Don't you know?

29
00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:00.666
That man just now?

30
00:01:00.666 --> 00:01:03.966
That look has been glued to the eldest lady's body

31
00:01:03.966 --> 00:01:06.466
Miss, that is a natural beauty.

32
00:01:06.533 --> 00:01:10.066
The man must have fallen in love with the eldest lady at first sight

33
00:01:10.066 --> 00:01:11.066
Possibly

34
00:01:11.066 --> 00:01:13.133
Otherwise, why is he so eager to serve?

35
00:01:13.133 --> 00:01:15.566
But he is a poor worker

36
00:01:15.566 --> 00:01:17.466
How can I be worthy of my noble guardian?

37
00:01:17.466 --> 00:01:18.500
daughter identity

38
00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.133
My cousin is worth hundreds of billions

39
00:01:21.133 --> 00:01:23.866
But seeing how handsome he is

40
00:01:23.866 --> 00:01:27.000
I can reluctantly fall in love with him

41
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.366
Then you have his contact information, but no.

42
00:01:29.366 --> 00:01:30.666
But don't you forget.

43
00:01:30.666 --> 00:01:34.266
My cousin owns this restaurant

44
00:01:34.266 --> 00:01:36.666
I would like the contact information of an employee

45
00:01:36.666 --> 00:01:38.366
That's not going to be easy.

46
00:01:38.366 --> 00:01:40.066
I'm so envious.

47
00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.500
That handsome guy, you shouldn't like him, right?

48
00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:44.400
I advise you.

49
00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:45.466
Look in the mirror

50
00:01:45.733 --> 00:01:47.666
Although they work part-time in a restaurant

51
00:01:47.666 --> 00:01:49.500
But it's a Michelin restaurant after all.

52
00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:50.600
Monthly income over 10,000

53
00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.500
Are you worthy of being a low-level female loser?

54
00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:55.633
Excuse me.

55
00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.666
The boss said he has his favorite cousin this week

56
00:01:57.666 --> 00:02:00.233
So today's dishes are all free of charge.
