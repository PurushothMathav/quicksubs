00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.333
Of course!

2
00:00:01.333 --> 00:00:04.100
We volunteer with Mengmeng, that's a pair

3
00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:06.033
Don't ask if we will get together or break up?

4
00:00:06.066 --> 00:00:06.866
You volunteer

5
00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:10.666
I am with you today.

6
00:00:10.666 --> 00:00:12.833
Your company can have so many projects

7
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.700
It's all me silently helping you behind your back

8
00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:17.366
And now you're breaking up with me?

9
00:00:17.366 --> 00:00:18.366
You shut up

10
00:00:18.366 --> 00:00:21.566
My son can start a company, that's my son's ability

11
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.300
What does it have to do with you?

12
00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.500
To tell you the truth, our neighbor?

13
00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:26.766
There is already a later.

14
00:00:26.766 --> 00:00:28.366
Oh you

15
00:00:28.366 --> 00:00:29.966
Die away from me

16
00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:31.166
What do you mean?

17
00:00:31.166 --> 00:00:34.166
Zhiyuan, tell him to give up

18
00:00:34.166 --> 00:00:37.400
Yes, Mengmeng is pregnant with my child

19
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.266
And it's probably a boy.

20
00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:41.500
Zhiyuan

21
00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:43.733
You cheated online

22
00:00:43.733 --> 00:00:45.566
How can you be so righteous?

23
00:00:45.566 --> 00:00:46.566
What derailment

24
00:00:46.566 --> 00:00:49.466
At first, you were so shameless to stick it up

25
00:00:49.566 --> 00:00:50.933
Hmm, just you

26
00:00:50.933 --> 00:00:52.466
Deserving of our neighbor

27
00:00:52.466 --> 00:00:54.100
Hillbilly who can't be mentioned

28
00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:55.566
Stay away from me

29
00:00:56.533 --> 00:01:00.466
Is your three-year relationship a joke?

30
00:01:00.466 --> 00:01:02.933
Love doesn't come first

31
00:01:02.933 --> 00:01:04.700
I'll cut the line, shut up

32
00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:09.166
So what are our previous eachother alliances?

33
00:01:09.166 --> 00:01:11.500
What a fart haha

34
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.633
Zhiyuan, the reason why I put up with you for three years

35
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.366
He thinks you are rich and powerful

36
00:01:17.366 --> 00:01:18.433
Oh, yeah.

37
00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:20.666
Volunteer for you to speak

38
00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.100
Is he talking nonsense?

39
00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:23.600
You didn't take advantage of me, did you?

40
00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:24.466
Say something.

41
00:01:24.466 --> 00:01:26.566
Volunteer not to be crying here
