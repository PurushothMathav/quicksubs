00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:02.566
Xiao Zheng, didn't you pick up my daughter?

2
00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:03.666
bastard

3
00:00:03.666 --> 00:00:06.933
It turns out that the eldest lady returned late to give birth to your resignation

4
00:00:06.933 --> 00:00:10.166
Dad, I acquiesced to Xiao Zhang's approach

5
00:00:10.166 --> 00:00:11.266
I just want to see

6
00:00:11.266 --> 00:00:14.100
What other monsters are hiding in the night market?

7
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:15.966
It's all the eldest lady who benefits

8
00:00:15.966 --> 00:00:17.600
I'm your woman

9
00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:18.466
You help me.

10
00:00:18.466 --> 00:00:19.766
I'm so disappointed.

11
00:00:19.766 --> 00:00:22.500
Blind, you found such a snobbish woman

12
00:00:22.733 --> 00:00:23.533
you

13
00:00:23.866 --> 00:00:25.166
Is a dead woman

14
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.366
Master and Miss

15
00:00:27.366 --> 00:00:30.000
I was confused and was shuttled by this woman for a while

16
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.366
Give me another chance.

17
00:00:31.366 --> 00:00:33.100
Zheng Hao, you contradict

18
00:00:33.333 --> 00:00:35.533
Let you be by my side for so many years

19
00:00:35.533 --> 00:00:36.766
Know my temper

20
00:00:36.766 --> 00:00:37.966
How do people deal with it

21
00:00:38.066 --> 00:00:38.866
It's up to you.

22
00:00:38.866 --> 00:00:40.866
I understand.

23
00:00:42.333 --> 00:00:44.266
Miss, I beg you

24
00:00:44.266 --> 00:00:45.800
It seems that we are colleagues

25
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.100
Please forgive me, miss, please forgive me

26
00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:49.800
Miss, I have old and young

27
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.266
I can't live without a job.

28
00:00:51.266 --> 00:00:52.300
I'm not a saint

29
00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:53.766
This is your own evil

30
00:00:53.966 --> 00:00:57.700
Dad, please help me save the information

31
00:00:57.733 --> 00:00:58.566
Miss

32
00:00:59.133 --> 00:01:00.000
Miss

33
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.066
Good girl

34
00:01:08.066 --> 00:01:09.000
You are wronged

35
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.300
It's okay, you're okay this time, what about next time?

36
00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:13.000
Dad, you are the only baby.

37
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.000
No more fooling around

38
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
The 10th anniversary dinner of the night market next month

39
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:16.966
You will officially replace me

40
00:01:16.966 --> 00:01:19.200
As the new president of the company, I

41
00:01:22.566 --> 00:01:23.500
Hello volunteer

42
00:01:25.166 --> 00:01:26.666
You are back home
