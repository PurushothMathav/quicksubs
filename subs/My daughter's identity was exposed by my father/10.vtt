00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:03.133
I'm sorry, ma'am, it's useful to apologize. Why do you want the police?

2
00:00:03.133 --> 00:00:04.900
I don't know how long Sister Ben Ya has been waiting?

3
00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:07.066
Do you know me?

4
00:00:07.066 --> 00:00:08.600
Nonsense, of course we know each other?

5
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:11.266
Butler Xiaozhuang, you are too ignorant, right?

6
00:00:11.266 --> 00:00:13.066
What about the name of the eldest lady Zhihu?

7
00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:16.100
Yeah, it's late and clash

8
00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:17.766
How did you fall?

9
00:00:17.766 --> 00:00:19.066
What are you saying?

10
00:00:21.366 --> 00:00:22.466
What's the situation?

11
00:00:22.466 --> 00:00:24.100
Shut up, do you still want to be with me?

12
00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:25.766
What is your colleague saying?

13
00:00:25.766 --> 00:00:27.066
Don't ask so much.

14
00:00:27.066 --> 00:00:28.566
You help these annoying colleagues

15
00:00:28.566 --> 00:00:29.900
Take it home and drive your fancy car

16
00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:30.900
Luxury cars are underarm

17
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.500
I'm only responsible for picking up the eldest lady

18
00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.066
If I let my grandpa know that I am a girlfriend

19
00:00:35.066 --> 00:00:36.866
Are those gentlemen and ladies important?

20
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:38.000
But what but

21
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Do you still want to shout to me?

22
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.833
In fact, I want to tell the eldest lady

23
00:00:42.866 --> 00:00:45.566
This little thing can still respect the eldest lady, what a waste

24
00:00:45.566 --> 00:00:47.000
Why do you hit people?

25
00:00:48.966 --> 00:00:49.800
Miss tube

26
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.733
What does summer have to do with you?

27
00:00:51.733 --> 00:00:52.533
fuck off

28
00:00:53.366 --> 00:00:55.300
Did you eat a bear heart burst umbrella?

29
00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:56.400
How are you doing?

30
00:00:56.566 --> 00:00:59.800
Miss, you have to support me too, who are you talking about?
