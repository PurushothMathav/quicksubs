00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:03.166
This kind of trash, you dare to be the best with me

2
00:00:03.166 --> 00:00:04.400
Who are you fooling?

3
00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:06.366
Miss, please handle it with care

4
00:00:06.366 --> 00:00:08.200
This rotten street stuff

5
00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:09.833
You told me to be careful

6
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.866
Miss, you don't have to buy it.

7
00:00:11.866 --> 00:00:12.933
But don't talk nonsense

8
00:00:12.933 --> 00:00:13.866
What do you mean?

9
00:00:13.866 --> 00:00:14.933
Say I don't know the goods.

10
00:00:14.933 --> 00:00:16.100
Do you know who I am?

11
00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:18.400
He is the daughter of your night market group

12
00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:19.666
You be careful

13
00:00:19.666 --> 00:00:21.200
I respect every guest

14
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.833
But this bracelet is really expensive

15
00:00:23.866 --> 00:00:24.800
What do you mean?

16
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:25.966
Do you think I can't afford it?

17
00:00:25.966 --> 00:00:27.966
You a broken salesperson should be riding on my head

18
00:00:27.966 --> 00:00:29.366
The poor today

19
00:00:29.366 --> 00:00:30.933
It's getting more and more presumptuous

20
00:00:30.933 --> 00:00:32.100
Offended him

21
00:00:32.133 --> 00:00:33.600
Be careful with your job

22
00:00:33.966 --> 00:00:34.800
aunt

23
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.933
He is just fulfilling the duty of a lover

24
00:00:36.933 --> 00:00:38.400
Is this for you to chime in?

25
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:39.600
I would like to ask

26
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.266
Here's your part.

27
00:00:41.366 --> 00:00:43.200
This bracelet is what I want to give to my aunt.

28
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.700
If your daughter doesn't like it, you can choose another one.

29
00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:47.100
Don't bump your hands

30
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.133
Sorry god

31
00:00:48.133 --> 00:00:50.166
Haha, you are a broken stone.

32
00:00:50.166 --> 00:00:52.400
Is it a gift in the eyes of you poor people?

33
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.100
How ridiculous in my eyes

34
00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:56.366
Shit is not

35
00:00:56.366 --> 00:00:58.666
Miss, don't smash it again

36
00:00:58.666 --> 00:01:00.100
Ye Meng, don't go too far

37
00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:01.333
If you don't buy it, just let it go.

38
00:01:01.333 --> 00:01:02.933
I don't let this be

39
00:01:02.933 --> 00:01:04.966
Otherwise, this lady is going to smash the beard.
