1
00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.100
It's too much.

2
00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:02.333
In the Ye family's company

3
00:00:02.333 --> 00:00:04.200
How dare you say that Miss Ye is too much?

4
00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:05.333
Who gave you the guts?

5
00:00:05.333 --> 00:00:07.800
He's not a lady, I'm not

6
00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.000
Are you

7
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.100
Tell you about this poor bastard

8
00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.100
This bag is my dad

9
00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:15.066
That's the chairperson of the Ye Group

10
00:00:15.066 --> 00:00:16.466
Ye Shoufu gave it away.

11
00:00:16.466 --> 00:00:18.800
That's what my dad does

12
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.866
No matter how jealous your dad is, he won't be the richest man

13
00:00:21.866 --> 00:00:24.966
Ye Qiuyan, hurry up and throw away your fake bag.

14
00:00:24.966 --> 00:00:26.500
Don't embarrass yourself here.

15
00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.100
It's still an eyesore to put away

16
00:00:29.266 --> 00:00:33.400
I can't stand the sand in my eyes

17
00:00:34.933 --> 00:00:36.200
Come on, sister, in front of you

18
00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.133
I've dealt with the eyesore trash for you.

19
00:00:38.133 --> 00:00:41.700
Garbage should be in the trash can.

20
00:00:42.666 --> 00:00:44.300
These are my personal effects

21
00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:45.766
Why do you do it at will?

22
00:00:45.766 --> 00:00:47.000
What are you?

23
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.400
In the Ye family's company

24
00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:51.266
Making the eldest lady feel at ease is the most important thing

25
00:00:51.266 --> 00:00:54.133
Don't say I lost your broken bag and made the eldest lady unhappy.

26
00:00:54.133 --> 00:00:56.466
You lost your job

27
00:00:56.466 --> 00:00:58.766
Carrying a fake bag and yelling

28
00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.566
Dozens of dollars for a fake bag is so rare.

29
00:01:02.566 --> 00:01:05.166
Poor people have shallow eyelids

30
00:01:05.166 --> 00:01:06.633
Don't shout thief here

31
00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:08.800
This bag is on sale in limited quantities.

32
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.600
Only one is distributed in the whole city.

33
00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.500
I can prove that mine is true.

34
00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:13.666
It's you

35
00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.233
Where did the fake come from?

36
00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:16.866
There's something else.

37
00:01:16.933 --> 00:01:18.966
I just bought it on Taobao group.

38
00:01:18.966 --> 00:01:20.466
How can I know that you will not send it?

39
00:01:20.733 --> 00:01:22.966
Even if only one is true

40
00:01:22.966 --> 00:01:26.166
It must also be in the hands of the eldest lady

41
00:01:26.166 --> 00:01:27.666
What are you pretending to be?

42
00:01:27.666 --> 00:01:30.366
Yes, it's impossible for me to carry a fake bag.

43
00:01:30.366 --> 00:01:31.766
This brand of bag

44
00:01:31.766 --> 00:01:33.800
There are anti-counterfeiting labels on the internal labels

45
00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.000
Whether it is true or false, you will know by scanning it with your mobile phone.
