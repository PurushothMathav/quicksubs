00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.500
Blind your dog eyes

2
00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:04.533
This is the only daughter of the Ye family

3
00:00:04.533 --> 00:00:06.666
Miss Ye Mengye

4
00:00:06.666 --> 00:00:07.933
He said I should shut up.

5
00:00:07.933 --> 00:00:09.166
You shameless servant

6
00:00:09.166 --> 00:00:11.233
Hurry up and wipe the table and get out

7
00:00:11.866 --> 00:00:14.300
Don't you feel guilty for pretending for so long?

8
00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:15.766
Since you don't know how to respect people

9
00:00:15.766 --> 00:00:17.733
Then I don't need to save face for you.

10
00:00:17.733 --> 00:00:18.666
What do you want?

11
00:00:18.666 --> 00:00:21.200
Let the housekeeper meet your eldest lady

12
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:22.400
You feed me to death

13
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:23.300
What are you afraid of?

14
00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:24.300
You are the eldest lady

15
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.566
After the housekeeper arrives

16
00:00:25.566 --> 00:00:27.933
Let him take this unknowing dog man and woman

17
00:00:27.933 --> 00:00:29.633
Throw it out with this servant

18
00:00:30.566 --> 00:00:31.433
Good idea.

19
00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:35.766
Oh, dear.

20
00:00:35.766 --> 00:00:38.566
It's all the fault of the small ones. What about the sisters-in-law and gentlemen?

21
00:00:38.566 --> 00:00:39.733
Ok I beg you

22
00:00:39.733 --> 00:00:40.566
Don't call the butler

23
00:00:40.566 --> 00:00:43.400
Otherwise, I won't be able to keep my job. It's alright

24
00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:44.866
I'll talk to the housekeeper.

25
00:00:46.566 --> 00:00:50.233
Oops, a poor country man takes you to say hum

26
00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:51.800
Did what you said work?

27
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:52.866
No, no.

28
00:00:52.866 --> 00:00:54.500
I'm on the table

29
00:00:56.866 --> 00:00:58.500
Don't worry, I'll go first.

30
00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.666
If you have any orders, call me again

31
00:01:03.333 --> 00:01:04.233
Oh, dear.

32
00:01:04.966 --> 00:01:06.466
What's all this?

33
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.800
Poor untouchables

34
00:01:08.966 --> 00:01:10.833
Come ride on my head

35
00:01:10.966 --> 00:01:13.266
Auntie, don't be angry.

36
00:01:13.333 --> 00:01:14.700
After the dinner party is over?

37
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.466
I drove that ignorant old woman

38
00:01:17.466 --> 00:01:19.200
He didn't do anything wrong.

39
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.766
You have no right to fire him either

40
00:01:20.766 --> 00:01:21.900
He is not qualified

41
00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:22.766
Do you have it?

42
00:01:22.766 --> 00:01:24.333
Of course I have Ye Qiuyan

43
00:01:24.333 --> 00:01:26.766
This is not the occasion for you to talk big

44
00:01:26.766 --> 00:01:29.533
How did this stinky man give you courage?

45
00:01:29.533 --> 00:01:33.166
When the new president arrives, you two will look good

46
00:01:33.166 --> 00:01:34.066
By the way, Mengmeng

47
00:01:34.066 --> 00:01:35.800
The new president of the Yeh Group

48
00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.300
That must be your Ye family

49
00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:38.700
Who is it?
