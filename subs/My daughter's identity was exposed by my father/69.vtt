00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:02.566
Are you serious?

2
00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:05.500
Of course I've said it many times

3
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.100
I like you.

4
00:00:07.733 --> 00:00:10.700
But you don't mind my past

5
00:00:11.266 --> 00:00:13.466
I have no right to overdo your past

6
00:00:13.466 --> 00:00:15.300
But I want to be involved with your new representative

7
00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.300
You so

8
00:00:20.533 --> 00:00:21.600
I talk about this project

9
00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:41.200
Jiu Ye Jiu Ye

10
00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:42.900
Seeing that we are old classmates

11
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:44.666
Just let me go back to the night market

12
00:00:44.666 --> 00:00:47.800
I'm sorry I can't have kids anymore

13
00:00:48.566 --> 00:00:50.166
Qu Yuan, you don't ask for your forgiveness

14
00:00:50.166 --> 00:00:52.200
But in terms of our previous relationship

15
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.300
Give me 50 million

16
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:54.900
Otherwise the company will go out of business

17
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.533
What about Chu Yan?

18
00:00:55.533 --> 00:00:57.900
That $50 million means nothing to you

19
00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:59.333
I beg you to help

20
00:00:59.333 --> 00:01:00.366
I beg you, okay?

21
00:01:00.366 --> 00:01:01.966
Do you count Qiuyuan as Buddhist clothing?

22
00:01:01.966 --> 00:01:02.966
Have a problem to solve

23
00:01:02.966 --> 00:01:04.166
Don't mess around here

24
00:01:04.166 --> 00:01:06.000
Before the police arrive

25
00:01:06.133 --> 00:01:07.566
I advise you to leave

26
00:01:07.766 --> 00:01:08.566
rescue

27
00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:10.666
Rescue rescue

28
00:01:10.666 --> 00:01:12.066
I kowtow to you

29
00:01:12.066 --> 00:01:13.866
I beg you, just help Mo

30
00:01:13.866 --> 00:01:16.066
Rescue you love to knock

31
00:01:16.966 --> 00:01:18.600
What you did to me

32
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.400
I can afford it, too.

33
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.066
Qiu Ye

34
00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:26.033
Master Qiu, your breakup with your daughter has nothing to do with me

35
00:01:26.066 --> 00:01:27.866
Want a big dog with me online

36
00:01:27.866 --> 00:01:29.166
You don't have to help him.

37
00:01:29.166 --> 00:01:30.566
But you have to help me.

38
00:01:30.566 --> 00:01:34.666
Are you allowed to blame the child in my belly for dying?

39
00:01:34.666 --> 00:01:37.066
Bitch, it's you who's to blame

40
00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:40.833
I told you not to ask you to accompany you to the funeral

41
00:01:42.766 --> 00:01:44.700
You just don't give me face.

42
00:01:44.933 --> 00:01:45.733
Ah!

43
00:01:46.466 --> 00:01:47.633
Ah!

44
00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.000
Ah!

45
00:01:53.466 --> 00:01:55.266
Son

46
00:01:58.133 --> 00:02:00.566
Night dream to this point today

47
00:02:00.566 --> 00:02:02.200
It's all your fault

48
00:02:02.533 --> 00:02:04.233
Even if I don't forgive you

49
00:02:04.333 --> 00:02:05.966
The law will not forgive you

50
00:02:05.966 --> 00:02:07.566
You have such high authority

51
00:02:07.766 --> 00:02:10.200
I could have lived this life happily

52
00:02:10.266 --> 00:02:10.533
It's You

53
00:02:10.533 --> 00:02:13.100
But because of your love and vanity, you let you go the wrong way

54
00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:14.100
And then...

55
00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.766
I hope you can do a good job in prison

56
00:02:16.866 --> 00:02:18.266
Make a contribution to society

57
00:02:18.666 --> 00:02:19.900
