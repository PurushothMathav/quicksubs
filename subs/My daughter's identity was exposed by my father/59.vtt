00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.600
Many bosses in the construction industry came today.

2
00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:04.800
And the wiring master who just returned to China

3
00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.066
You must seize the opportunity

4
00:00:06.066 --> 00:00:08.300
I've already chosen a date to wait with him

5
00:00:08.466 --> 00:00:10.233
You're definitely not welcome.

6
00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:12.466
Ye Qiuyan, why are you here?

7
00:00:12.466 --> 00:00:13.533
Who is this man?

8
00:00:13.533 --> 00:00:14.933
Sure enough, it's a cheap hoof

9
00:00:14.933 --> 00:00:17.100
I just broke up with my son for a few days

10
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.766
Grab the head and find a wild man

11
00:00:18.766 --> 00:00:20.800
Can you keep your mouth clean?

12
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:22.233
Lijun hum

13
00:00:22.333 --> 00:00:25.033
Ye Qiuyan, are you really not picky about your food?

14
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.533
He was actually with a famous poor student at that time

15
00:00:28.533 --> 00:00:31.866
Haha, no matter how poor you are, you are better than this hypocrite.

16
00:00:32.366 --> 00:00:33.500
Don't eat grapes

17
00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:34.966
Grapes say grape acid

18
00:00:34.966 --> 00:00:37.066
Look at your suit

19
00:00:37.066 --> 00:00:38.333
Like a dog

20
00:00:38.333 --> 00:00:41.433
Did you sell yourself and forget about the rich woman?

21
00:00:41.466 --> 00:00:43.600
Oh, it's a little white face

22
00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.766
When your woman was in school

23
00:00:45.766 --> 00:00:48.266
But he is chasing after me, a little white face

24
00:00:48.266 --> 00:00:49.533
No matter how you refuse, you don't mention it.

25
00:00:49.533 --> 00:00:51.266
It's causing me a lot of trouble.

26
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:52.300
You like him?

27
00:00:52.566 --> 00:00:54.500
That was before

28
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.966
Later, I found out that he was a poor student

29
00:00:56.966 --> 00:00:58.200
I ignored him

30
00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:03.000
After all, poor people are contagious. Okay?

31
00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.300
This poor man

32
00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:05.966
The skin is really thick

33
00:01:05.966 --> 00:01:08.100
Forget about this random fooling in.

34
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.900
How dare you sit at the main table and ask?

35
00:01:10.966 --> 00:01:13.100
Hmph, you are a daughter

36
00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.666
You order them out now
