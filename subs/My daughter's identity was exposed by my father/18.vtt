00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:02.366
Just a naive intern

2
00:00:02.366 --> 00:00:03.966
It's okay sir

3
00:00:04.166 --> 00:00:05.066
Sir?

4
00:00:05.666 --> 00:00:07.000
I want to thank you. Thank you.

5
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.700
Can you add a contact information?

6
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:09.566
Raise your hand, right?

7
00:00:09.566 --> 00:00:11.266
I have one more thing to pay in advance

8
00:00:13.533 --> 00:00:15.566
What is a handsome account?

9
00:00:15.566 --> 00:00:18.800
This is my Prince Charming

10
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.033
Dangerous. Dangerous.

11
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:23.566
What about grandpa?

12
00:00:23.566 --> 00:00:24.266
boss

13
00:00:24.266 --> 00:00:26.800
The little one has invited the eldest lady and a group of people to go in.

14
00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.100
Are those the ones who went in just now?

15
00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:28.900
Yes!

16
00:00:28.933 --> 00:00:31.133
So you can check what box number they are.

17
00:00:31.133 --> 00:00:33.066
I'll go there in person in a while

18
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.566
Is this in English?

19
00:00:39.566 --> 00:00:41.700
Why can't I understand any of them?

20
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.166
It's in French as if you could understand it

21
00:00:44.166 --> 00:00:45.700
I learned French when I was 5

22
00:00:45.766 --> 00:00:48.100
Of course I can understand such a simple menu

23
00:00:48.166 --> 00:00:52.066
Miss, I really don't understand that you are a regular customer.

24
00:00:52.066 --> 00:00:54.366
You have some, and I will choose the same for you.

25
00:00:54.366 --> 00:00:57.566
Yes, my sister recommended me some delicious dishes.

26
00:00:57.566 --> 00:00:59.866
I don't understand these dog signs either

27
00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.700
Whatever, have this

28
00:01:02.933 --> 00:01:04.166
One more of this.

29
00:01:05.733 --> 00:01:06.533
you

30
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.300
Do you want to change one?

31
00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:10.400
What for? I'm helping relatives.

32
00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.200
I can still afford it.

33
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.366
Ye Qiuyan

34
00:01:13.466 --> 00:01:16.766
You're the only one who eats, don't babble there

35
00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:18.266
Serve me

36
00:01:18.266 --> 00:01:19.466
Are you sure?

37
00:01:19.466 --> 00:01:21.133
I'll take both courses.

38
00:01:21.133 --> 00:01:22.766
What's the problem?

39
00:01:22.766 --> 00:01:25.833
The Canon and Moonlight you ordered are piano pieces.
