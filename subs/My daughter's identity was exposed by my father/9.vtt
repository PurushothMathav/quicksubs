00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:01.966
That lady

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.566
What's going on?

3
00:00:03.566 --> 00:00:06.166
Warn this car

4
00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:09.733
No, I picked it up at the company.

5
00:00:09.733 --> 00:00:10.800
I gave it back to you

6
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.300
You slandered me

7
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.600
You almost got fooled.

8
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.866
Damn it, you guys are the most annoying

9
00:00:16.866 --> 00:00:18.400
You said you thought you were just pretending

10
00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.000
This pheasant can become a phoenix

11
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Yeah oops

12
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Pretended wealth is empty

13
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:25.133
Why are you looking at me?

14
00:00:25.133 --> 00:00:26.866
Don't even think about riding in my luxury car for a while

15
00:00:27.133 --> 00:00:28.533
Did you hear what the eldest lady said?

16
00:00:28.533 --> 00:00:30.366
Hurry up and ride your broken car away

17
00:00:30.366 --> 00:00:32.866
Since you all say this car is mine

18
00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:33.800
Then I'm in charge

19
00:00:34.533 --> 00:00:36.333
This car is for you.

20
00:00:36.333 --> 00:00:38.733
Really? This is the electric car you were talking about.

21
00:00:38.733 --> 00:00:39.900
It's worth thousands of dollars

22
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:41.266
Uh, everyone testify for me?

23
00:00:41.266 --> 00:00:42.600
He said he wanted to give it to me.

24
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.200
Then I'll drive it.

25
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:45.866
I sent my car

26
00:00:45.866 --> 00:00:49.466
Miss, do you have any questions? No

27
00:00:51.733 --> 00:00:53.966
My car!

28
00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:55.533
Some people here?

29
00:00:55.533 --> 00:00:58.300
Pretending to be cool in front of the security guards

30
00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.666
Haha, now there is no car to go home.

31
00:01:01.733 --> 00:01:03.800
Ye Qiuyan, walk back

32
00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.100
My luxury car won't be with you

33
00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:05.933
Do you hear me?

34
00:01:05.933 --> 00:01:07.000
deaf

35
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.466
Go away I'm not going

36
00:01:08.733 --> 00:01:10.666
I'm also waiting for the car to pick me up.

37
00:01:10.766 --> 00:01:13.000
I'm still pretending that you are a little

38
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.400
In fact, where are you so afraid of vanity?

39
00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.366
It's not me who is vain

40
00:01:29.566 --> 00:01:32.600
Ninety-five supreme five nines

41
00:01:36.166 --> 00:01:37.466
Sorry ma'am
