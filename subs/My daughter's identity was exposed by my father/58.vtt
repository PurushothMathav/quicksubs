00:00:00.533 --> 00:00:02.500
Hey, why would Mengmeng not want to?

2
00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:03.400
Right, Mengmeng?

3
00:00:04.466 --> 00:00:06.300
Yes of course

4
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:09.666
Then you should call the president of the night market now

5
00:00:10.333 --> 00:00:11.133
Wow

6
00:00:12.133 --> 00:00:13.266
Mengmeng, what do you mean?

7
00:00:13.266 --> 00:00:14.900
You didn't mean after being with me

8
00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:16.300
Is the night market group ours?

9
00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:18.333
Why don't you even give up an invitation letter now?

10
00:00:18.333 --> 00:00:19.466
No.

11
00:00:20.333 --> 00:00:21.966
You? Who are you?

12
00:00:22.133 --> 00:00:24.200
I was ordered to deliver the invitation

13
00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:31.166
Is it the tenth anniversary dinner?

14
00:00:35.933 --> 00:00:36.766
I see

15
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.800
Oops, our company is saved.

16
00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.533
Great, great.

17
00:00:41.533 --> 00:00:43.733
I said Mengmeng won't care about us?

18
00:00:43.733 --> 00:00:45.300
Hahaha Mengmeng

19
00:00:45.533 --> 00:00:46.933
You sent someone to deliver it

20
00:00:46.933 --> 00:00:50.200
I talked to the new CEO last night

21
00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:51.966
I didn't expect him to deliver so slowly.

22
00:00:52.766 --> 00:00:55.600
Mengmeng, I blamed you just now.

23
00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:56.766
That's okay.

24
00:00:56.766 --> 00:01:00.766
We'll go with Auntie then. Okay.

25
00:01:01.066 --> 00:01:01.866
Let's go together

26
00:01:06.133 --> 00:01:07.966
Son, look at this performance

27
00:01:07.966 --> 00:01:10.366
As expected of the largest enterprise in the country

28
00:01:10.366 --> 00:01:12.233
How grand are you?

29
00:01:12.533 --> 00:01:15.600
You see a lot of rich people and officials there

30
00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.400
Mengmeng, which table are we sitting at?

31
00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.166
After all, I'm out for a picnic

32
00:01:21.166 --> 00:01:22.200
It's okay to be low-key

33
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.133
The harder it is to be found if you cross it.

34
00:01:25.133 --> 00:01:26.566
Let's sit away

35
00:01:26.566 --> 00:01:28.100
Quiet is not

36
00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:29.533
How can that work?

37
00:01:29.533 --> 00:01:30.566
Academic plus daughter

38
00:01:30.766 --> 00:01:32.900
You should be the master of dreams

39
00:01:32.933 --> 00:01:34.400
Don't you dislike it?

40
00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:35.900
I'll embarrass you with Zhiyuan

41
00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:38.800
No, no, then call the shots

42
00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:40.733
So that I can show my leaves

43
00:01:40.733 --> 00:01:42.433
The identity of the future son-in-law

44
00:01:42.566 --> 00:01:45.100
That's right, oh
