00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:00.966
Miss

2
00:00:01.766 --> 00:00:03.166
I didn't know your identity two days ago.

3
00:00:03.166 --> 00:00:04.666
How can this be offended?

4
00:00:04.666 --> 00:00:08.166
The owner's appearance and temperament are so first-class

5
00:00:08.166 --> 00:00:09.966
It turned out to be the daughter of the richest man.

6
00:00:09.966 --> 00:00:13.166
These idiots mistook me for the eldest lady of the Ye family

7
00:00:13.166 --> 00:00:14.500
It's better to be wrong

8
00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:16.600
Anyway, with my looks and abilities

9
00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.766
If you are absolutely careless, you are my eldest lady

10
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.733
It's just not a good fit, right?

11
00:00:20.733 --> 00:00:22.366
He is the eldest lady

12
00:00:22.666 --> 00:00:23.466
You got it wrong.

13
00:00:23.466 --> 00:00:24.500
Excuse me.

14
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.200
Let you recognize why he didn't come out again

15
00:00:27.666 --> 00:00:29.866
Chairperson Ye's daughter is in my hands

16
00:00:29.866 --> 00:00:32.200
I'm flattered.

17
00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:33.733
I go to the grassroots

18
00:00:33.733 --> 00:00:36.200
To experience the life of ordinary people

19
00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.133
You just need to know who I am

20
00:00:38.133 --> 00:00:40.666
Don't preach it everywhere ah yes yes yes yes yes

21
00:00:40.666 --> 00:00:42.166
Miss, you have ordered

22
00:00:42.166 --> 00:00:43.866
We naturally dare not talk nonsense.

23
00:00:43.866 --> 00:00:46.533
Haha, the eldest lady is too low-key.

24
00:00:46.533 --> 00:00:48.566
This is the real daughter's style

25
00:00:48.566 --> 00:00:52.166
Unlike some people, the more lacking something, the more dazzling it is

26
00:00:52.166 --> 00:00:53.866
What about your actual report at Apple?

27
00:00:53.866 --> 00:00:55.066
Ink for so long

28
00:00:55.266 --> 00:00:56.333
Gotta delay

29
00:00:56.333 --> 00:00:58.566
Oh, stop pretending.

30
00:00:58.566 --> 00:00:59.433
Here it is.

31
00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:01.600
Louis' new model

32
00:01:02.533 --> 00:01:03.600
Assistant Ye?

33
00:01:04.266 --> 00:01:05.200
Miss Yela

34
00:01:05.266 --> 00:01:08.166
Isn't this the same bag you carried?

35
00:01:08.466 --> 00:01:10.600
Ye Qiuyan, you really love vanity

36
00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.366
As soon as I entered the company, I was faked

37
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.133
What are you saying?

38
00:01:15.133 --> 00:01:16.133
Who carries the fake bag?

39
00:01:16.133 --> 00:01:19.500
What identity do you have with the same bag as my sister?

40
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.466
This bag is worth 600,000

41
00:01:22.533 --> 00:01:25.333
You can afford to be an intern at the bottom.

42
00:01:25.333 --> 00:01:25.866
weird

43
00:01:25.866 --> 00:01:27.600
Carrying a fake bag to work at the night market

44
00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.366
Then you are giving our Chairperson Ye's face?

45
00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.500
This is what my dad gave me

46
00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.700
It was your poor parents who bought the counterfeit

47
00:01:35.933 --> 00:01:39.433
The upper beam is not correct and the lower beam is crooked.
