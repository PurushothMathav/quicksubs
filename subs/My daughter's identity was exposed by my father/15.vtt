00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:03.400
It is our blessing to know the eldest lady

2
00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:05.600
Yesterday, we rode in a Rolls Royce.

3
00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:07.733
Today, I'm going to the Michelin restaurant again.

4
00:00:07.733 --> 00:00:11.166
Hey, miss, are we taking that intern?

5
00:00:11.166 --> 00:00:13.533
There was no room for luxury cars last night

6
00:00:13.533 --> 00:00:15.466
Did you catch the last bus?

7
00:00:15.766 --> 00:00:18.966
Look at your classmates and see you miserable every day

8
00:00:18.966 --> 00:00:20.300
Come to dinner with us today

9
00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:25.266
Oh, miss, you are so kind, bumpkin

10
00:00:25.266 --> 00:00:27.866
It's too ugly to eat later.

11
00:00:27.866 --> 00:00:29.700
Save some face for our eldest lady

12
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:32.800
Okay, then I'll thank the eldest lady first

13
00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.100
Pick up the trash first, I'll call the cleaning

14
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.000
Wait a minute.

15
00:00:36.566 --> 00:00:38.900
I'm asking you to pick it up with your hands

16
00:00:38.933 --> 00:00:41.566
What, don't you understand human language? Pick it up

17
00:00:41.733 --> 00:00:42.766
Don't delay our meal

18
00:00:42.766 --> 00:00:44.166
I didn't fall.

19
00:00:44.166 --> 00:00:46.900
Later, eat my drink my

20
00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:49.266
Are you so reluctant to let you do some work now?

21
00:00:49.266 --> 00:00:51.466
You have the lowest status here.

22
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.266
If you still want to intern here

23
00:00:53.266 --> 00:00:55.866
Just store it honestly for me.

24
00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:01.800
Look at his arrogance

25
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.000
I don't know, I thought he was the eldest lady

26
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.500
Does he deserve the real lady here?

27
00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.800
Order whatever you want to eat later, I want to eat shredded radish

28
00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.200
How can I have such a group of blind people?

29
00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.900
Blind colleague

30
00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:21.666
Hello, welcome.

31
00:01:21.666 --> 00:01:23.133
Do you have an appointment?

32
00:01:23.133 --> 00:01:25.400
I still have to make an appointment for dinner

33
00:01:26.666 --> 00:01:28.666
I miss the eldest lady of the Ye family

34
00:01:28.666 --> 00:01:30.200
You should be immune

35
00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:31.100
Of course.

36
00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.200
Miss Ye is the super supreme VIP of our store.

37
00:01:34.266 --> 00:01:35.866
Great lady

38
00:01:35.866 --> 00:01:38.200
Hurry up and get your super supreme VIP.

39
00:01:38.266 --> 00:01:40.166
Show this ignorant waiter

40
00:01:42.666 --> 00:01:46.500
Ah, I came out in a hurry and forgot to bring it.

41
00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.900
Then you can give our boss a call.

42
00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:50.700
How do I have your boss's phone number?

43
00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.533
Don't you say you are the eldest lady of the Ye family?

44
00:01:52.533 --> 00:01:54.800
Our boss is your cousin.
