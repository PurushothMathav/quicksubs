00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.666
Where can I get them a Manchu and Han feast?

2
00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:05.566
Our dinner party

3
00:00:05.566 --> 00:00:06.733
Usually open late

4
00:00:06.733 --> 00:00:09.633
Why don't we all have a drink first?

5
00:00:09.766 --> 00:00:11.566
Since the eldest lady said so

6
00:00:11.566 --> 00:00:13.466
I happen to be thirsty too

7
00:00:13.533 --> 00:00:15.000
Where is the drink? Where am I going?

8
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.300
Of course it's the refrigerator.

9
00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:17.500
Go get it

10
00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:18.400
Are you sure?

11
00:00:19.166 --> 00:00:20.366
It's your say

12
00:00:20.366 --> 00:00:22.133
I don't know about my home?

13
00:00:22.133 --> 00:00:24.000
What are you doing?

14
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.566
It's Miss

15
00:00:25.566 --> 00:00:26.566
Not there.

16
00:00:28.933 --> 00:00:30.200
Dawdling

17
00:00:30.266 --> 00:00:31.500
You're dying of thirst

18
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.166
Miss, do you have any drinks in the refrigerator?

19
00:00:35.166 --> 00:00:36.833
Have you looked carefully?

20
00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.733
How can you not drink under your armpits?

21
00:00:39.733 --> 00:00:42.133
I've searched everything and there's nothing

22
00:00:42.133 --> 00:00:44.166
I said it wasn't there

23
00:00:44.933 --> 00:00:45.733
You let

24
00:00:47.866 --> 00:00:49.566
Blind your dog eyes

25
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.766
Ah!

26
00:00:51.766 --> 00:00:54.900
I almost forgot I didn't have a drink at home, damn it

27
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.133
Didn't buy it

28
00:00:56.133 --> 00:00:57.366
Is that so?

29
00:00:57.366 --> 00:01:01.000
Which one of you can order takeout? Order the most expensive wine.

30
00:01:02.533 --> 00:01:04.533
Come to my house, I don't want to live with this little money

31
00:01:04.533 --> 00:01:05.800
Then get out of here

32
00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:07.166
Don't be so aggressive

33
00:01:07.166 --> 00:01:11.066
Is there wine in the house? Are you the master or am I the master?

34
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.300
Get your hands off me!

35
00:01:14.766 --> 00:01:17.766
Don't you want to drink? It will be expensive later.

36
00:01:17.766 --> 00:01:20.633
Are you a fool or a local dog?

37
00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.533
The eldest lady is the master

38
00:01:22.533 --> 00:01:25.100
If he said no, then there must be no.

39
00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.000
Why do you know better than the master?

40
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.966
Just look at it, what the hell?

41
00:01:28.966 --> 00:01:31.100
Let it go and give up
