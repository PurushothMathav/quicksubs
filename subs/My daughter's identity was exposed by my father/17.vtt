00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:01.700
Who owes you that?

2
00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:03.200
Stop your boss sister?

3
00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:05.900
It's really Miss Ye who blinded your dog's eyes

4
00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:07.966
The boss has received the message, which can be fake.

5
00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:10.366
Miss, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to

6
00:00:10.366 --> 00:00:11.700
The villain is never Tarzan

7
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:12.800
Please forgive me.

8
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.466
Miss, please come in

9
00:00:14.466 --> 00:00:15.833
Don't delay your application of the dining hall.

10
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:24.766
What happened just now?

11
00:00:24.766 --> 00:00:27.266
Didn't your cousin say he didn't have time to entertain me?

12
00:00:27.266 --> 00:00:29.466
Is it really Ye Qiuyan?

13
00:00:29.533 --> 00:00:31.333
He just sent a message.

14
00:00:31.333 --> 00:00:32.800
Someone came to pick us up

15
00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:34.200
I didn't lie to you, did I?

16
00:00:34.466 --> 00:00:36.600
Ye Qiuye, why are you so shameless?

17
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:37.666
My cousin

18
00:00:37.666 --> 00:00:39.200
Although I don't have time to entertain me

19
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.200
But he knew I was at the door.

20
00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.266
Being harassed by that lowly waiter

21
00:00:43.266 --> 00:00:45.000
So send someone to pick us up

22
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.333
I was almost fooled by you.

23
00:00:47.333 --> 00:00:48.966
pretend

24
00:00:48.966 --> 00:00:50.900
Who the hell do you send WeChat to?

25
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.800
Take out your phone and show it to me.

26
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.266
This is my privacy.

27
00:00:54.266 --> 00:00:55.566
You have no right to view

28
00:00:55.566 --> 00:00:57.566
You are an intern at the night market

29
00:00:57.566 --> 00:00:59.466
And I am the daughter of the night market

30
00:00:59.466 --> 00:01:00.300
You a c.

31
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.500
Why should my servants who work in the company reject me?

32
00:01:03.566 --> 00:01:04.466
Give it to me.

33
00:01:06.933 --> 00:01:09.500
It's okay, why did my cousin come out?

34
00:01:09.766 --> 00:01:12.466
When he sees me, I have to record it.

35
00:01:12.466 --> 00:01:14.166
I'm fine. I'm fine.

36
00:01:14.166 --> 00:01:15.700
Then send it to you.

37
00:01:15.733 --> 00:01:16.966
Excuse me?

38
00:01:17.466 --> 00:01:18.766
You dare to hurt people

39
00:01:18.766 --> 00:01:19.900
Apologize quickly

40
00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:21.100
What's going on here?

41
00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:22.066
So be it.
