00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:01.866
Love Love

2
00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:03.300
Stop pretending

3
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.366
Orville is not something we can offend

4
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.333
Girl, you still want to buy us like this

5
00:00:08.333 --> 00:00:10.433
Regret is not as good as finance

6
00:00:10.866 --> 00:00:12.100
Let me give you some advice

7
00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:14.033
You followed me?

8
00:00:14.166 --> 00:00:17.333
I'll give you a few more days to prepare the money.

9
00:00:17.333 --> 00:00:19.266
How realistic is that?

10
00:00:19.266 --> 00:00:21.066
Hey, yes, yes, yes.

11
00:00:21.066 --> 00:00:24.433
You look for him, you see he's still a bit pretty

12
00:00:24.733 --> 00:00:26.300
Take him away with you and sell him

13
00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:27.933
He can still make some money

14
00:00:27.933 --> 00:00:29.900
Ok hey hey

15
00:00:29.933 --> 00:00:32.333
Is it your turn to talk?

16
00:00:32.333 --> 00:00:35.900
Three fucking are good enough to take away

17
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.000
Boss, this is the bitch who owes 5 million

18
00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.166
We can handle it if the boss sits there.

19
00:00:46.166 --> 00:00:50.700
Brother, can you praise my sister for letting go?

20
00:00:52.166 --> 00:00:53.200
Let go hey hey hey

21
00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.000
let go

22
00:00:54.133 --> 00:00:56.500
It seems that the night market has acquired Australian finance

23
00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.433
Our company was acquired by the Night Market Group

24
00:01:01.066 --> 00:01:04.133
Dude, let's save some face for others

25
00:01:04.133 --> 00:01:05.466
You're welcome Qiuyan

26
00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:07.466
That call just now was real

27
00:01:07.466 --> 00:01:09.300
I said he was fake.

28
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.066
Ouch, made you laugh.

29
00:01:12.066 --> 00:01:14.733
These bastards are used to it

30
00:01:14.733 --> 00:01:16.466
Didn't it hurt you?

31
00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:17.466
No apologies
