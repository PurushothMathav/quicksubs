00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:03.100
Miss Ye's pen is so useful.

2
00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:05.000
You can eat and drink for free

3
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.666
Looks like I managed to fool everyone

4
00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:10.066
What's wrong with my cousin coming out?

5
00:00:10.166 --> 00:00:11.266
Miss

6
00:00:11.266 --> 00:00:15.300
Is your cousin an ugly girl maniac?

7
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:17.300
You are so happy.

8
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:18.666
Our Ye family

9
00:00:18.666 --> 00:00:20.300
Just me

10
00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.400
Of course, it's the apple of the family's eye

11
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.766
Today is a good time

12
00:00:25.766 --> 00:00:28.166
When will this Michelin dish be available?

13
00:00:28.166 --> 00:00:30.533
It's me. I can't wait.

14
00:00:30.533 --> 00:00:31.933
Serve quickly

15
00:00:31.933 --> 00:00:33.533
There are more guests today.

16
00:00:33.533 --> 00:00:35.100
It may take a while.

17
00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.133
Don't you know who I am?

18
00:00:37.133 --> 00:00:39.166
Ordinary guests get out of the way

19
00:00:39.166 --> 00:00:40.266
Give me first

20
00:00:40.266 --> 00:00:43.366
Keep your eyes peeled

21
00:00:43.366 --> 00:00:47.566
This is your boss's most precious back.

22
00:00:47.733 --> 00:00:48.666
Excuse me.

23
00:00:48.666 --> 00:00:50.233
It's against the rules.

24
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.900
How dare the stinky waiter talk back to me

25
00:00:54.133 --> 00:00:56.000
I don't want to do it anymore, don't worry.

26
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.900
Night cat, you are too much.

27
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.466
I just happened to be treating you to dinner

28
00:01:03.466 --> 00:01:05.300
Is this how you repay me?

29
00:01:07.166 --> 00:01:08.500
Quickly apologize to the eldest lady

30
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.066
He should have apologized to the waiter.

31
00:01:11.066 --> 00:01:12.400
Against you

32
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.400
Sister brother, give your eldest lady a good drink
