00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.000
Don't mess with my car, who will I let sit in?

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.866
I have the final say who doesn't let me sit

3
00:00:04.866 --> 00:00:05.966
No, you said that.

4
00:00:05.966 --> 00:00:08.700
Let's experience Miss's luxury car?

5
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.466
Yeah, I did

6
00:00:10.466 --> 00:00:12.000
Bring you, a migrant worker at the bottom

7
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.066
Meet my luxury car

8
00:00:13.066 --> 00:00:15.133
Now that you've seen it, you can get out of here

9
00:00:15.133 --> 00:00:16.266
Only them

10
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:17.366
I want to get in the car

11
00:00:17.366 --> 00:00:18.900
Thank you ma'am

12
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.000
The eldest lady is kind and kind

13
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.366
Not like some people.

14
00:00:22.366 --> 00:00:24.100
He's as thick-skinned as a city wall

15
00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:25.300
Can't get away

16
00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.700
It turns out that the eldest lady and colleagues like to step on high and low?

17
00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:31.566
Hey, Sister Zhang, your words are off the air.

18
00:00:31.566 --> 00:00:34.000
We're taking it out on the lady

19
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.600
This Ye Qiuyan has been bumping into the eldest lady for a day

20
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:37.566
Yes, yes.

21
00:00:37.566 --> 00:00:39.366
Are we standing up for the eldest lady?

22
00:00:39.366 --> 00:00:42.866
Teach this ignorant intern a lesson

23
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.866
I'm not qualified to teach Zheng Hao a lesson

24
00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:46.633
Who are you?

25
00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:51.933
Let's all get in the car together

26
00:00:51.933 --> 00:00:53.500
Luxury cars are more luxurious

27
00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:54.866
Space is limited.

28
00:00:54.866 --> 00:00:58.400
It's not that I'm rich and stingy, I really can't sit still

29
00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:59.766
Who are you?

30
00:00:59.766 --> 00:01:01.400
I'm the manager.

31
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.466
I usually take care of the eldest lady the most

32
00:01:03.466 --> 00:01:05.666
Miss and I often have lunch together

33
00:01:05.666 --> 00:01:06.933
We have a good relationship

34
00:01:06.933 --> 00:01:08.766
No matter how high or low the rank

35
00:01:08.766 --> 00:01:10.366
Or is this relationship far and near?

36
00:01:10.366 --> 00:01:12.066
I think the three of us

37
00:01:12.066 --> 00:01:13.500
More suitable for high-class cars

38
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:14.600
Right?

39
00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:15.800
What about Qiuyan this night?

40
00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.066
Just started today

41
00:01:17.066 --> 00:01:19.166
He's a little intern.

42
00:01:19.166 --> 00:01:22.200
He doesn't deserve to be the daughter of our chairperson at all

43
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.700
Forget the car

44
00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:24.800
I won't get in the car

45
00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:28.700
I've arranged for a car to pick me up, stop pretending

46
00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.000
Ye Qiuyan, run away

47
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.133
Otherwise, I will miss the last bus.

48
00:01:32.133 --> 00:01:33.533
Stop talking and get in the car

49
00:01:33.533 --> 00:01:35.666
Suddenly remembered something Ye Qiuyan

50
00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:36.766
What else?

51
00:01:36.766 --> 00:01:38.466
You'd better explain.

52
00:01:38.466 --> 00:01:40.266
How did you know about my luxury car?

53
00:01:40.266 --> 00:01:41.600
The license plate number is 5 9s.
