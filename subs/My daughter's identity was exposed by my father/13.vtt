00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:03.333
He not only knew, he had your license plate number in his dream

2
00:00:03.333 --> 00:00:04.700
So shameless

3
00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:09.000
Yes, this lady doesn't even remember the car number

4
00:00:09.066 --> 00:00:12.166
How did player Ye know the number of the ninety-five supreme grades?

5
00:00:12.166 --> 00:00:14.300
It was a graduation gift from my father

6
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:15.566
How could you forget

7
00:00:15.566 --> 00:00:17.100
Oh, I see.

8
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.600
It must be Ye Xiuyuan

9
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.900
I have long envied Miss Jing

10
00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:22.533
Always pay attention to the dynamics of the eldest lady

11
00:00:22.533 --> 00:00:23.700
Even what car to buy

12
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:26.200
He knows all about Haobai

13
00:00:26.366 --> 00:00:29.266
This is to imitate and impersonate the eldest lady.

14
00:00:29.366 --> 00:00:30.700
It's not embarrassing.

15
00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:32.066
Look in the mirror

16
00:00:32.466 --> 00:00:34.000
Not so rich

17
00:00:34.133 --> 00:00:36.066
Don't dream of wealth

18
00:00:36.066 --> 00:00:39.400
Yes, people are more important in self-knowledge

19
00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.933
You have to mock me, I dare not?

20
00:00:41.933 --> 00:00:45.666
Miss, look at me today

21
00:00:45.666 --> 00:00:48.366
There are a lot of adults, but I don't care about you.

22
00:00:48.366 --> 00:00:50.666
Don't make trouble with me in the future

23
00:00:50.666 --> 00:00:51.766
It's getting late today

24
00:00:51.766 --> 00:00:52.966
Let's get in the car.

25
00:00:52.966 --> 00:00:55.133
Just waiting for the eldest lady to speak

26
00:00:55.133 --> 00:00:57.000
I can finally experience a luxury car

27
00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.433
I'm so excited.

28
00:00:59.133 --> 00:01:00.300
Go go go go

29
00:01:12.666 --> 00:01:14.566
Why hasn't dad come back yet?

30
00:01:14.933 --> 00:01:17.300
Is Xiao Zheng late?

31
00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:18.266
Nope.

32
00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.733
But I asked him to send a few of my colleagues back first.

33
00:01:21.733 --> 00:01:23.133
Ouch, good girl.

34
00:01:23.133 --> 00:01:24.966
You are so kind

35
00:01:25.166 --> 00:01:27.866
But now it's too late to send a car

36
00:01:28.333 --> 00:01:29.366
Slow and congested

37
00:01:29.733 --> 00:01:30.200
Is that so?

38
00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.300
Dad, I'll contact the helicopter at home to pick you up.

39
00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:33.100
Hey no

40
00:01:39.933 --> 00:01:42.166
Hey, did you hear?

41
00:01:42.166 --> 00:01:45.900
A helicopter landed on the roof of the company yesterday

42
00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:47.600
This is not a movie

43
00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.566
How is that possible?

44
00:01:49.666 --> 00:01:50.600
I asked

45
00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.466
It's the chairperson's jet.

46
00:01:52.466 --> 00:01:54.766
Yesterday, I came to pick up a lady late
