00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:01.366
Miss will pick you up later

2
00:00:01.366 --> 00:00:03.400
What is the car number? Please tell me.

3
00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:04.466
We'll keep an eye on him for you

4
00:00:04.466 --> 00:00:07.566
How can I remember this? Our one-garage car?

5
00:00:07.566 --> 00:00:08.666
Dozens of cars

6
00:00:08.966 --> 00:00:10.266
How can I get in?

7
00:00:10.666 --> 00:00:11.833
That's true.

8
00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:14.666
But I remember every car in my house

9
00:00:15.166 --> 00:00:17.700
Why do you keep pushing the bar?

10
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:19.933
Are you jealous of your old classmates?

11
00:00:19.933 --> 00:00:21.066
Down payment daughter

12
00:00:21.066 --> 00:00:24.066
Every car feels like a lot of your cars

13
00:00:24.066 --> 00:00:25.700
No more no less

14
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.066
50 cars hahahahaha

15
00:00:30.066 --> 00:00:34.833
Are 50 bicycles or 50 electric vehicles?

16
00:00:34.966 --> 00:00:40.566
Five Rolls-Royces, a Mercedes, a BMW, a Bentley.

17
00:00:40.566 --> 00:00:42.500
Don't flatter him

18
00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:46.066
But 50 bikes are quite valuable.

19
00:00:46.066 --> 00:00:47.200
Hey Ye Qiulian

20
00:00:47.266 --> 00:00:48.066
I guess.

21
00:00:48.066 --> 00:00:51.000
You have to take the bus to and from work every day, right?

22
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.100
Riding in my luxury car for the first time

23
00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.300
It's inevitable to be a little excited

24
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.400
No matter how excited you are, you can't talk nonsense, right?

25
00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.566
I really want to experience the bus

26
00:01:00.566 --> 00:01:03.800
But my dad has people pick me up every day to and from get off work.

27
00:01:03.966 --> 00:01:06.166
Hahahaha

28
00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:08.100
You little intern?

29
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.100
It really got me going.

30
00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.500
Dare to speak nonsense in front of the company's eldest lady

31
00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:13.666
I'll pick you up later.

32
00:01:13.666 --> 00:01:15.533
What is the title? Please tell me.

33
00:01:15.533 --> 00:01:16.766
My sister will keep an eye on it for you

34
00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:17.800
Five nines

35
00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.466
Five nines hahaha your feet

36
00:01:20.466 --> 00:01:22.366
That's the one who sold 500 million

37
00:01:22.366 --> 00:01:23.866
Added ninety-five supreme

38
00:01:23.866 --> 00:01:25.200
License plate number Ye Xiaoxia

39
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.666
You can brag too much.

40
00:01:26.666 --> 00:01:28.100
Your vanity?

41
00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.100
In front of my real prison

42
00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:31.700
Looks ridiculous

43
00:01:31.866 --> 00:01:34.166
Hey, who parked the electric car on the side of the road outside you?

44
00:01:34.166 --> 00:01:36.566
The pink one is blocking the lane, please move it.

45
00:01:36.566 --> 00:01:39.500
This place belongs to you, and the poorest should be yours, right?

46
00:01:39.566 --> 00:01:43.200
What 95 Supreme still has someone to pick up and drop off?

47
00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.300
It turned out to be the little broken electric donkey by the roadside.

48
00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:48.900
Okay, hurry up and drive your broken car away

49
00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.766
Later, the eldest lady's luxury car will come and scratch it.

50
00:01:51.766 --> 00:01:54.166
You work all your life, you can't even fix it

51
00:01:54.166 --> 00:01:55.266
It's not mine.

52
00:01:55.566 --> 00:01:58.033
Ye Meng, the car keys in your hand

53
00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:59.933
It's an electric car key, isn't it?

54
00:01:59.933 --> 00:02:01.200
Is it the eldest lady?

55
00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.400
Luxury car workshop car with four wheels

56
00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.966
What's the use of a broken electric donkey with two wheels?

57
00:02:05.966 --> 00:02:08.366
Could it be the key to the villa door?

58
00:02:08.366 --> 00:02:11.900
Let's put your little broken car on the eldest lady

59
00:02:12.066 --> 00:02:13.166
Would you like it?

60
00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.900
Hey, hey, looking at that car makes some people give up
