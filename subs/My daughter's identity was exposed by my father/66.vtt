00:00:00.566 --> 00:00:02.466
What? He's your daughter?

2
00:00:03.733 --> 00:00:06.266
You turned out to be a scary daughter

3
00:00:06.266 --> 00:00:08.166
Don't smash our house

4
00:00:08.166 --> 00:00:09.266
I hit you

5
00:00:09.866 --> 00:00:11.766
Hit me if you want

6
00:00:12.566 --> 00:00:14.266
It's all your fault

7
00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.366
Why are you not rich?

8
00:00:18.366 --> 00:00:23.033
Why are you just a single waiter?

9
00:00:23.266 --> 00:00:25.800
Mengmeng, don't move Mengmeng

10
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.366
My face was thrown away by you

11
00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.300
Your mother loves you so much

12
00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.433
You don't care about loving her

13
00:00:36.466 --> 00:00:38.533
You humiliated her in front of so many people

14
00:00:38.533 --> 00:00:39.900
She is a good mother.

15
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:40.700
And willing

16
00:00:41.133 --> 00:00:43.366
It's the unfilial daughter who makes him unable to lift his head

17
00:00:43.366 --> 00:00:44.800
Shut the fuck up

18
00:00:45.566 --> 00:00:48.366
Daughter, I beg you not to do this

19
00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:51.500
Is a person is a person is

20
00:00:51.733 --> 00:00:55.400
It's him, it's this bitch who bewitches me

21
00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:56.600
He lied to me.

22
00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.566
Zhiyuan, you are so disgusting

23
00:00:58.566 --> 00:01:00.100
I don't know your mistake yet.

24
00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.866
And blame it all on women

25
00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.200
Young Master, all mistakes are my fault

26
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.066
I admit that you are a daughter-in-law

27
00:01:08.066 --> 00:01:08.800
You are now

28
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.366
Can you enter our Lin's door now?

29
00:01:11.366 --> 00:01:12.600
Ok hum

30
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.000
What is your Lin family?

31
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.300
How dare you climb high on our eldest lady of the Ye family

32
00:01:16.333 --> 00:01:17.200
aunt

33
00:01:17.333 --> 00:01:20.600
Leave your daughter-in-law's position to someone else

34
00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:21.933
I can't stand it.

35
00:01:21.933 --> 00:01:23.200
go go

36
00:01:23.866 --> 00:01:25.666
Sorry, sorry.

37
00:01:25.666 --> 00:01:27.900
I know I was wrong, sorry son.

38
00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.000
Sorry, I don't know.

39
00:01:29.133 --> 00:01:30.866
Uncle, I beg you

40
00:01:30.866 --> 00:01:32.733
Go forgive and volunteer once

41
00:01:32.733 --> 00:01:34.133
He simply committed a crime

42
00:01:34.133 --> 00:01:36.600
It's just a mistake that all men under the hall make

43
00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.566
Saving Young Master Yan is really a virtue to let people go

44
00:01:42.266 --> 00:01:44.300
You really don't forgive me

45
00:01:44.366 --> 00:01:46.000
You don't deserve to be in love with me

46
00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.100
It's all fucking you who forced me

47
00:01:51.066 --> 00:01:52.366
Miss

48
00:01:52.366 --> 00:01:55.866
The new president of the night market is a second-hand product I have played with

49
00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:56.900
Followed me for three years

50
00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:58.266
I don't want it anymore. It's a pity.

51
00:01:58.933 --> 00:02:01.900
Oh, big news, snap, snap.

52
00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:03.333
Now everyone is covered

53
00:02:03.333 --> 00:02:05.133
Everyone knows how you are a spare tire

54
00:02:05.133 --> 00:02:07.000
I see who dares to marry you now

55
00:02:08.066 --> 00:02:09.000
I marry
