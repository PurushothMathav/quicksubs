00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.466
What are you looking at me for?

2
00:00:01.466 --> 00:00:01.966
Night Cat

3
00:00:01.966 --> 00:00:05.000
You didn't come back with us last night

4
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.666
Yeah, it's still a Rolls Royce

5
00:00:07.666 --> 00:00:08.966
Where did the helicopter come from?

6
00:00:08.966 --> 00:00:10.533
If I heard correctly

7
00:00:10.533 --> 00:00:13.100
The eldest lady doesn't seem to know that your house has a helicopter.

8
00:00:13.333 --> 00:00:14.200
What's going on?

9
00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:15.600
Aren't you the eldest lady of the Ye family?

10
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.900
I didn't react for a while

11
00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:20.033
And what is a helicopter?

12
00:00:20.066 --> 00:00:21.800
How many cruise ships does my family have?

13
00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.366
Then what happened last night?

14
00:00:25.366 --> 00:00:25.966
And?

15
00:00:25.966 --> 00:00:27.966
Didn't we take the car back together yesterday?

16
00:00:27.966 --> 00:00:29.600
Isn't it because of someone?

17
00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.266
Dawdling there

18
00:00:31.266 --> 00:00:33.000
Delayed my time to go home

19
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.300
My dad thought something happened on the road

20
00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.466
That's why they sent a helicopter to pick me up

21
00:00:37.466 --> 00:00:39.100
Hey, is that so?

22
00:00:40.566 --> 00:00:42.200
Just finished my Rolls Royce

23
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:43.666
You dare to question me today

24
00:00:43.666 --> 00:00:44.500
dare not dare

25
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.366
Miss, I offended you, haha.

26
00:00:47.366 --> 00:00:50.666
The chairperson really loves the eldest lady so much

27
00:00:50.666 --> 00:00:51.566
Okay, okay.

28
00:00:51.566 --> 00:00:52.600
This afternoon?

29
00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:53.500
Just on vacation

30
00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.866
What am I going to eat for dinner?

31
00:00:55.866 --> 00:00:57.733
This lady is not a person who is short of money.

32
00:00:57.733 --> 00:00:58.500
You choose

33
00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.733
In order to show off your power in the company in the future

34
00:01:00.733 --> 00:01:01.766
Promotion and salary increase

35
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.766
It's nothing to put money in now

36
00:01:03.766 --> 00:01:06.066
Then let's go to the prosperous world

37
00:01:06.066 --> 00:01:09.066
It's the only seven-star restaurant

38
00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.600
One of the production positions of the Ye family in the prosperous age

39
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.366
That's where Upper Street used to eat

40
00:01:14.366 --> 00:01:15.933
Can we really go?

41
00:01:15.933 --> 00:01:18.766
Of course I am the richest man in the world

42
00:01:18.766 --> 00:01:21.266
Just take you ordinary colleagues to meet the world

43
00:01:21.266 --> 00:01:22.466
Noodles, right?

44
00:01:22.466 --> 00:01:23.066
Miss

45
00:01:23.066 --> 00:01:27.666
I heard the minimum spend there is 100,000 oh ah

46
00:01:28.133 --> 00:01:31.033
100,000 such a fool really dare to pick a place

47
00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.900
100,000

48
00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:34.700
Isn't that just a drizzle for the rich?

49
00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.200
Miss, are we still going to Shengshi?
