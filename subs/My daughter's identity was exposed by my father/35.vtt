00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:00.766
Mom

2
00:00:00.766 --> 00:00:03.700
The marriage hasn't been decided yet, let alone the children

3
00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:06.500
Come and sit down and have tea together

4
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.500
Auntie, this is my little thought

5
00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:11.033
Bird's nest, Ejiao, etc.

6
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.066
What are you doing?

7
00:00:13.066 --> 00:00:15.666
What I usually eat is a few thousand dollars a tael

8
00:00:15.666 --> 00:00:18.300
I dare not eat this kind of bargain

9
00:00:18.333 --> 00:00:19.566
Thousands of taels

10
00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:21.666
I was raised 50,000

11
00:00:21.666 --> 00:00:23.700
But my dad brought it back from abroad

12
00:00:23.733 --> 00:00:26.300
Mom, this bird's nest is also Qiu Yan's intention.

13
00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.000
If you don't eat it, you can give it to the maid.

14
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.366
Zhiyuan

15
00:00:29.366 --> 00:00:29.800
Qiu Yuan

16
00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.400
I know you weren't well prepared the first time you came up

17
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:33.666
Where is the application?

18
00:00:33.733 --> 00:00:35.400
My dad's Beijing hukou

19
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:36.966
My mother is a Tocheng hukou

20
00:00:36.966 --> 00:00:38.900
But I was born abroad

21
00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:39.866
How should I put it?

22
00:00:40.566 --> 00:00:42.700
Hard to say. Hard to say.

23
00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:45.133
I see you are unspeakable

24
00:00:45.133 --> 00:00:46.800
Your home is rural, right?

25
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.333
Our old neighbor counts three generations up

26
00:00:49.333 --> 00:00:52.100
That has nothing to do with the countryside.

27
00:00:52.133 --> 00:00:54.300
Now rural hukou is also quite valuable

28
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.000
Do you have a room?

29
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.866
In the suburbs and the suburbs

30
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.366
Could it be a rural self-built house?

31
00:01:01.466 --> 00:01:03.000
City Suburban Villa

32
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.766
There are also several sets in the city center

33
00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:05.466
Mom

34
00:01:05.466 --> 00:01:08.300
The air in the suburbs is pretty fresh now, right, Auntie?

35
00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:10.366
There are still many flowers and trees in my house

36
00:01:10.366 --> 00:01:11.966
What can be found in the countryside?

37
00:01:11.966 --> 00:01:13.066
No money.

38
00:01:13.066 --> 00:01:15.266
The most is not free flowers and plants

39
00:01:15.266 --> 00:01:16.433
My son Zhiyuan

40
00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:18.766
I can't live in the forest with you like a primitive

41
00:01:18.766 --> 00:01:19.600
That thatched hut

42
00:01:19.966 --> 00:01:21.700
Not my children

43
00:01:21.966 --> 00:01:24.200
But my family has a piece of children

44
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.500
Bamboo door to bamboo door

45
00:01:25.733 --> 00:01:27.000
Wooden door to wooden door

46
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.200
You are a countryman

47
00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.233
How can we city people deserve it?
