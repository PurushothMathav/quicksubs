00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:03.133
This is a luxury store owned by the Night Market Group

2
00:00:03.133 --> 00:00:04.200
That's Mengmeng's

3
00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:05.666
You country man

4
00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.200
I'm afraid I can't even afford a small bead here.

5
00:00:08.366 --> 00:00:09.233
aunt

6
00:00:09.566 --> 00:00:13.000
Eight can't afford it, I'll buy it for you or Mengmeng Director

7
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:16.766
This looks good.

8
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.466
This looks good too.

9
00:00:18.466 --> 00:00:19.366
What about this one?

10
00:00:19.366 --> 00:00:22.033
Don't try to get any bargains for you.

11
00:00:22.733 --> 00:00:23.566
Hey

12
00:00:24.266 --> 00:00:25.600
That's pretty good.

13
00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:26.900
Crystal clear

14
00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:29.500
It should be prettier to wear

15
00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.700
That's it, ma'am. You have a good eye.

16
00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:33.766
This is the top Hetian jade in Shuitou.

17
00:00:33.766 --> 00:00:35.300
The craftsmanship is also the best at the moment

18
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:36.566
in good condition

19
00:00:36.566 --> 00:00:38.166
It's estimated to be in the millions.

20
00:00:38.366 --> 00:00:39.766
Fortunately, I brought out the black card.

21
00:00:40.133 --> 00:00:41.466
Auntie likes it

22
00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:42.666
Please wrap it up for me

23
00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:45.800
Okay, I want to climb this big tree in your house.

24
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.300
Sleeping far enough is not enough

25
00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.366
Gotta hold on to this old woman's heart

26
00:00:50.366 --> 00:00:52.100
Wait auntie

27
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.200
Your graceful upper class temperament

28
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.600
How can you wear something chosen by a lower-class person?

29
00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:58.900
If you don't say I forgot

30
00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:00.200
You are the daughter

31
00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.733
You know the quality of this bracelet best.

32
00:01:02.733 --> 00:01:05.600
The quality of this bracelet is definitely top grade.

33
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.366
You, an inferior person, know what a top grade is?

34
00:01:08.666 --> 00:01:11.966
Are you complaining about me with some cheap goods?

35
00:01:11.966 --> 00:01:14.133
Longyan bought fake smoke last time.

36
00:01:14.133 --> 00:01:15.400
How could it be this time?

37
00:01:15.466 --> 00:01:18.533
Didn't take off the best bracelet in your store

38
00:01:18.533 --> 00:01:19.466
Excuse me.

39
00:01:19.466 --> 00:01:21.100
This is the most expensive in our store.

40
00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:22.500
The best seeds
