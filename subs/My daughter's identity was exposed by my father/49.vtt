00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:00.800
Who are you?

2
00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:01.666
Why come to my house?

3
00:00:01.666 --> 00:00:03.133
That woman owes us money

4
00:00:03.133 --> 00:00:05.533
Do you think you don't have to pay back if you hide here?

5
00:00:05.533 --> 00:00:06.900
I tell you

6
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:08.366
Today is his king

7
00:00:08.366 --> 00:00:10.966
I have to pay back when I come

8
00:00:13.566 --> 00:00:15.633
It's okay to be poor

9
00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:18.200
How dare you bring foreign debt into your home?

10
00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.466
I don't have any marriage money, how dare you quibble?

11
00:00:20.666 --> 00:00:22.300
Why are you not a thing?

12
00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:23.733
Dare to borrow usury

13
00:00:23.733 --> 00:00:25.766
Tomorrow you dare to kill and set fire to

14
00:00:25.766 --> 00:00:27.600
What did Zhao Kaiguo say?

15
00:00:27.733 --> 00:00:29.200
Lord Dog, calm down

16
00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.000
This matter is related to our neighbors

17
00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:32.733
It doesn't matter.

18
00:00:32.733 --> 00:00:34.200
How dare you hide in our house and be an old man

19
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.033
Why don't you get out of here?

20
00:00:36.066 --> 00:00:39.133
It's not my ninth master, you go to wash the dishes if you have no money

21
00:00:39.133 --> 00:00:40.366
Borrow from what usury?

22
00:00:40.366 --> 00:00:42.733
We've known each other for three years

23
00:00:42.733 --> 00:00:43.766
How could you think

24
00:00:43.766 --> 00:00:45.600
Am I the kind of person who doesn't pay back what I owe?

25
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.000
Okay, okay.

26
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.266
What kind of play is the family playing here?

27
00:00:50.266 --> 00:00:52.100
It's all family

28
00:00:52.333 --> 00:00:54.566
Do you remember this money?

29
00:00:54.733 --> 00:00:55.800
Don't get me wrong.

30
00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.766
We have nothing to do with this woman

31
00:00:58.766 --> 00:01:01.000
You mustn't trot

32
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.266
Did I fucking let you sweep it?

33
00:01:02.266 --> 00:01:04.566
Ah, sit down.

34
00:01:04.733 --> 00:01:07.300
What is a dream loan shark?
