00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.666
Miss, why hasn't your luxury car arrived yet?

2
00:00:05.666 --> 00:00:06.800
It's getting dark

3
00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:08.300
I said you

4
00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:10.300
Why don't you know any manners?

5
00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:13.666
They kindly invited you to take a luxury car, why did they urge you?

6
00:00:13.666 --> 00:00:16.066
These ordinary citizens without knowledge

7
00:00:16.066 --> 00:00:17.833
That's how shallow the eye sockets are

8
00:00:18.133 --> 00:00:18.666
Miss

9
00:00:18.666 --> 00:00:21.666
You say your driver is too incompetent, right?

10
00:00:21.666 --> 00:00:23.133
What time is it?

11
00:00:23.133 --> 00:00:24.366
I guess there's a traffic jam.

12
00:00:24.366 --> 00:00:25.866
I call out

13
00:00:30.966 --> 00:00:33.133
It just so happens that you don't work in a hospital?

14
00:00:33.133 --> 00:00:35.133
Hurry up and get the three of Doctor Ye out together

15
00:00:35.133 --> 00:00:36.966
But I have to pick up the eldest lady later

16
00:00:36.966 --> 00:00:38.666
If you don't come, we'll break up

17
00:00:38.666 --> 00:00:42.166
Hurry up and deliver my colleague first, and then go to deliver the eldest lady.

18
00:00:42.166 --> 00:00:43.566
How did you hit me?

19
00:00:45.966 --> 00:00:47.466
I have taught him a lesson

20
00:00:47.466 --> 00:00:49.100
The car will be here soon.

21
00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:50.500
Missy Mighty

22
00:00:50.533 --> 00:00:52.133
These people you used to work for

23
00:00:52.133 --> 00:00:53.600
Work is dawdling

24
00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.133
No scolding

25
00:00:55.133 --> 00:00:56.066
Miss

26
00:00:56.066 --> 00:00:59.533
Can I take a picture in your luxury car later?

27
00:00:59.533 --> 00:01:01.366
I haven't been in a luxury car yet

28
00:01:01.366 --> 00:01:03.833
No, don't be so petty

29
00:01:04.066 --> 00:01:05.900
Sister, who is the driver of your car?

30
00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:07.766
Why do you have so many questions?

31
00:01:07.766 --> 00:01:09.533
The Ye family was casually scared

32
00:01:09.533 --> 00:01:10.800
Everyone's salary is higher than yours

33
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:11.900
Do you deserve to know?

34
00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:13.300
Although he doesn't deserve to know

35
00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:15.566
But I don't want people to say that I bully old classmates

36
00:01:15.566 --> 00:01:16.800
Then I'll tell you.

37
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.133
You know Ye's account number, right?

38
00:01:19.133 --> 00:01:22.700
He is the son of the senior housekeeper of the Ye family

39
00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.866
He handles all the affairs of the Ye family

40
00:01:24.866 --> 00:01:27.200
You shouldn't have happened to be my driver

41
00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:28.533
But my dad worries about me

42
00:01:28.533 --> 00:01:31.533
So I let him be a little driver

43
00:01:31.533 --> 00:01:35.166
Butler Xiao Zheng is what the Ye family focuses on cultivating

44
00:01:35.166 --> 00:01:38.266
It seems that the richest man Ye loves the eldest lady very much

45
00:01:38.266 --> 00:01:39.333
Of course!

46
00:01:39.333 --> 00:01:41.500
My father treats me like a princess

47
00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.066
He wanted to testify against me.

48
00:01:43.066 --> 00:01:45.366
Isn't he going to save me later?

49
00:01:45.366 --> 00:01:49.333
What is the license plate number of the Rolls Royce that picks you up?

50
00:01:49.333 --> 00:01:53.966
The car of the richest man is of course 888666.

51
00:01:53.966 --> 00:01:57.433
Right? Miss forgot to ask for this number in total.
