00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:02.666
Good girl, stop the car for me

2
00:00:03.133 --> 00:00:07.366
Dear daughter, stop the car for me, I won't

3
00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:42.200
My dignified daughter returns to China to do cleaning

4
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:43.966
What is this?

5
00:00:43.966 --> 00:00:46.700
Dad, I was experiencing life

6
00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:48.266
Experience life in your own company

7
00:00:48.266 --> 00:00:50.000
You can choose any position in the night market group.

8
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.333
Dad said it was an experience of life

9
00:00:53.333 --> 00:00:55.300
Of course it starts at the grassroots level

10
00:00:55.466 --> 00:00:57.566
If you want me to go back to work at the night market, you can

11
00:00:57.566 --> 00:00:58.700
You have to promise me

12
00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:00.000
Can't reveal my identity

13
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.566
Good dad promises you

14
00:01:10.533 --> 00:01:12.800
Miss Rong goes to work

15
00:01:13.266 --> 00:01:14.266
Tell it to go

16
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.066
My daughter, Ye Zhenghai, is in her own company

17
00:01:17.133 --> 00:01:19.466
Never be wronged at all

18
00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.400
Why doesn't my dad keep his word?

19
00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.300
They all said things that are not tolerated

20
00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:45.500
Why are you still stunned?

21
00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.000
Hurry up and set up the venue

22
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.066
The orientation meeting is about to start.

23
00:01:49.066 --> 00:01:52.100
OK, so it's an orientation party?

24
00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:53.600
Fortunately not exposed

25
00:01:59.133 --> 00:02:00.700
I don't have eyes when walking?

26
00:02:01.333 --> 00:02:02.600
Obviously it's you

27
00:02:03.766 --> 00:02:04.933
Isn't this Ye Meng?

28
00:02:04.933 --> 00:02:05.900
Who are you?

29
00:02:05.933 --> 00:02:08.866
We are high school classmates, I am Ye Qiuyan

30
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.200
It turned out to be that trash out of high school

31
00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.100
Fees you can't even get into college

32
00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:14.400
How did you study the planning department?

33
00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.200
With my true skills, who says I can't get out?

34
00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.233
I am your true ability to send the right to study abroad

35
00:02:20.566 --> 00:02:22.100
With the skills in bed

36
00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:23.666
Keep your mouth clean

37
00:02:23.666 --> 00:02:26.333
You still don't admit the bad things you did

38
00:02:26.333 --> 00:02:28.266
Look at your rustic clothes

39
00:02:28.333 --> 00:02:29.500
Deserving of our country

40
00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.500
One or two of the biggest companies?

41
00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.100
I'm here to work

42
00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:36.200
It's not a catwalk, it's better said than sung

43
00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:37.666
What ability do you have?

44
00:02:37.666 --> 00:02:40.366
You don't even know how to use an Apple computer, huh?

45
00:02:40.366 --> 00:02:41.600
Excuse me?

46
00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.066
To disappoint you, I will not only use

47
00:02:44.166 --> 00:02:47.433
I'm still an intern at Apple headquarters

48
00:02:47.666 --> 00:02:49.900
What to go abroad

49
00:02:50.066 --> 00:02:52.000
Hahaha ouch

50
00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.900
Why didn't I find you so good at blowing when I was in school?

51
00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.800
Yeah, it's undocumented

52
00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.733
It's not that he can blow however he wants

53
00:02:59.733 --> 00:03:02.800
Coincidentally, my internship report was in the bag

54
00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:04.366
Say you're fat and you're still breathing

55
00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:05.533
Take it out

56
00:03:05.533 --> 00:03:07.466
Yeah, take it out!

57
00:03:11.266 --> 00:03:13.100
Why is the pig vest here?

58
00:03:13.133 --> 00:03:14.466
No wonder he saw

59
00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:15.700
Expose my identity

60
00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:16.700
What is friction?

61
00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:18.000
Take out the internship report
