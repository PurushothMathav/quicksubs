1
00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:02.800
In the future, Qiu Yuan will marry me to accept the hukou

2
00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:05.533
How did I give birth to such a good and evil silly son as you?

3
00:00:05.533 --> 00:00:08.733
If you can seduce my son, you will secretly enjoy it

4
00:00:08.733 --> 00:00:12.000
Don't wait until you get married to volunteer for a green card

5
00:00:12.066 --> 00:00:13.900
It seems that Auntie doesn't care

6
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.900
What do your parents do?

7
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.100
My mom died early

8
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.100
My dad is a real estate professional

9
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.366
Looks like your dad moved bricks on the construction site

10
00:00:22.366 --> 00:00:25.566
Is the president of the largest real estate company in the country

11
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.666
Yeah. Didn't your dad do real estate?

12
00:00:27.666 --> 00:00:29.066
Tens of millions a day

13
00:00:29.066 --> 00:00:31.666
He just made it up to climb you

14
00:00:31.666 --> 00:00:34.800
I can tell you about the coolie who moves bricks on the construction site

15
00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:36.600
It's hard to earn 100 a day

16
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.200
Auntie, I'm not lying.

17
00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:38.800
and

18
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.333
Our love has nothing to do with what our parents do.

19
00:00:41.333 --> 00:00:42.200
How irrelevant

20
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.700
My son, only child.

21
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.666
Graduated from a famous university in the city

22
00:00:47.666 --> 00:00:49.500
Now I have my own company

23
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.100
Then marrying you is like helping the poor

24
00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.100
Mom, say less

25
00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:55.300
It's his silly son

26
00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.066
You're going to take this tofu ping home

27
00:00:57.066 --> 00:00:58.633
You don't think about your mother's feelings anymore

28
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.400
It's Qiuyan

29
00:01:00.533 --> 00:01:01.700
We were in different places before.

30
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.200
You said you were returning to China.

31
00:01:03.366 --> 00:01:04.766
In fact, he went back to the countryside

32
00:01:04.766 --> 00:01:06.033
Why are you acting big?

33
00:01:07.333 --> 00:01:09.366
- I'm not lying.

34
00:01:09.366 --> 00:01:12.400
Our love has nothing to do with money

35
00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.100
Love without material things is a mess of sand

36
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.500
Qiuyan, don't be too naive.

37
00:01:17.533 --> 00:01:20.000
Zhiyuan, do you regret being with me?

38
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.800
I can't help it if you think so.

39
00:01:22.733 --> 00:01:25.366
Who is it? Your daughter-in-law is here.

40
00:01:25.366 --> 00:01:27.366
Auntie, you are late.
