00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:01.566
Aren't you an uncle?

2
00:00:01.566 --> 00:00:02.566
Why don't I know?

3
00:00:02.566 --> 00:00:04.766
I have such a shameless daughter

4
00:00:04.766 --> 00:00:06.366
You are the chairperson

5
00:00:06.366 --> 00:00:09.233
Then you are me, the daughter of the Ye family

6
00:00:10.066 --> 00:00:10.500
Ye Mao

7
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.000
Have you been lying to me? You've been lying to us for so long.

8
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.200
What are you scaring us all into?

9
00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.966
Ye Mao, you've made us all miserable

10
00:00:17.566 --> 00:00:18.800
Yanyan said she wants to be independent

11
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.066
I just let him go

12
00:00:20.066 --> 00:00:22.866
But I didn't expect you little people to get into the air

13
00:00:22.866 --> 00:00:23.733
Bullying my daughter

14
00:00:23.733 --> 00:00:26.166
Chairperson, I didn't interpret the dream.

15
00:00:26.333 --> 00:00:29.066
I've been swallowing it, not because I'm weak

16
00:00:29.066 --> 00:00:30.900
But because I saw a colleague

17
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.300
I don't want to argue with you.

18
00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:34.566
But you pretend that the eldest lady is addicted

19
00:00:34.566 --> 00:00:37.200
In the company, it is even more lawless

20
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.866
And you fawn over the so-called eldest lady

21
00:00:39.866 --> 00:00:42.900
Make all kinds of ridiculous and hateful states of mind

22
00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:44.466
It's really chilling.

23
00:00:44.466 --> 00:00:47.133
My company doesn't allow bailout settlements

24
00:00:47.133 --> 00:00:48.400
Those who hold high and step low

25
00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.666
You four get out of here right now

26
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.366
Chairperson, we were wrong.

27
00:00:52.366 --> 00:00:54.200
Wrong, we are blind

28
00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.800
Chairperson, I was wrong, I was wrong.

29
00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.666
Chairperson, I am innocent

30
00:00:57.666 --> 00:00:59.166
It's him, it's this bitch

31
00:00:59.166 --> 00:01:00.633
You've been lying to me

32
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.700
Who gave you the guts to impersonate my daughter?

33
00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:04.500
i

34
00:01:04.566 --> 00:01:07.133
Didn't I tell you to protect the eldest lady?

35
00:01:07.133 --> 00:01:09.300
I took care of him for a while when I was a kid

36
00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:10.166
Butler Xiao Zheng

37
00:01:10.166 --> 00:01:12.700
Last night, I drove the luxury car of Jiuwu Supreme to pick up Ye Mao

38
00:01:12.733 --> 00:01:13.733
They got us in the way.

39
00:01:13.733 --> 00:01:15.366
Is it right?
