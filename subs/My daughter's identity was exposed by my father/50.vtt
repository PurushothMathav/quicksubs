00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.333
Big brother, big brother, I beg you to let it go

2
00:00:02.333 --> 00:00:05.500
Brother, I was wrong, I really have no money.

3
00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:08.600
No, I've seen a lot of guys like you

4
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:10.366
Today 5 million must return

5
00:00:10.366 --> 00:00:11.466
Not a penny less

6
00:00:11.466 --> 00:00:14.200
Otherwise, I will change your face first.

7
00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:15.533
Then sell your blood to receive customers

8
00:00:15.533 --> 00:00:16.500
Hey wait wait

9
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.300
Did you identify the wrong person?

10
00:00:18.333 --> 00:00:19.733
He is the daughter of the Ye family

11
00:00:19.733 --> 00:00:21.100
How can I owe you money?

12
00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:22.466
I don't care who he is.

13
00:00:22.466 --> 00:00:24.666
5 million must return it today

14
00:00:24.666 --> 00:00:27.666
And he borrowed money from a loan shark

15
00:00:27.666 --> 00:00:28.766
Must be wrong

16
00:00:28.766 --> 00:00:29.400
Dream dream

17
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.066
But the richest man in our city

18
00:00:32.066 --> 00:00:33.133
Married daughter

19
00:00:33.133 --> 00:00:34.500
He has money

20
00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.100
How can I borrow money from you?

21
00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:37.400
Hey, let me tell you.

22
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:38.666
The man who owes money

23
00:00:38.666 --> 00:00:40.466
I recognize it when it turns to ashes

24
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.666
Threats of violence are going to be replicated in night markets

25
00:00:43.666 --> 00:00:45.600
Where are you going?

26
00:00:45.933 --> 00:00:47.733
Thanks, nosy, right?

27
00:00:47.733 --> 00:00:50.533
Mind your own business, I will fight with you

28
00:00:50.533 --> 00:00:52.000
Someone smash it for me

29
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.366
Can't hit can't hit

30
00:00:53.366 --> 00:00:56.566
This is what my son has worked hard for half his life

31
00:00:56.566 --> 00:00:58.400
You're tired of fucking living, aren't you?
