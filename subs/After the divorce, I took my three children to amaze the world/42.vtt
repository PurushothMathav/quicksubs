00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:04.466
Shut your mouth

2
00:00:04.966 --> 00:00:06.333
We, Shenwei Group

3
00:00:06.333 --> 00:00:08.566
It is the second largest group in the country

4
00:00:08.733 --> 00:00:11.500
The lowest employees are all key universities

5
00:00:11.566 --> 00:00:13.500
You didn't even go to college

6
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.666
Dare to say that you didn't go through the back door

7
00:00:15.733 --> 00:00:18.400
Dare to steal credit from colleagues

8
00:00:22.266 --> 00:00:25.433
These data reports are indeed done by me alone

9
00:00:25.733 --> 00:00:27.366
I still have a backup on my computer

10
00:00:27.866 --> 00:00:30.233
If you don't believe me, you can check it out.

11
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.133
So what if that line has medical expenses?

12
00:00:33.133 --> 00:00:34.700
Maybe you came early in the morning

13
00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.266
Deliberately send me away from the post. It's reliable

14
00:00:36.266 --> 00:00:38.666
That's right, Mr. Yang, we all saw it with our own eyes

15
00:00:38.666 --> 00:00:40.366
It's all deleted. One guy did it.

16
00:00:40.366 --> 00:00:41.800
You can't take credit for that.

17
00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.200
Shanshan, don't be afraid.

18
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.433
I will definitely give you a palace fight today

19
00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.900
I'll let you say it again, brat

20
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.600
Who did this report?

21
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.766
Think about it

22
00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.166
If it makes me dissatisfied

23
00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.633
I don't care who is behind you.

24
00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.466
I will fire you today

25
00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:03.700
Never mind.

26
00:01:04.466 --> 00:01:06.100
It's just a data report. You

27
00:01:06.766 --> 00:01:08.466
Can't trouble Promise Snow

28
00:01:08.466 --> 00:01:09.666
Have you decided?

29
00:01:10.933 --> 00:01:11.966
Think about it

30
00:01:12.966 --> 00:01:13.900
data report

31
00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:15.900
Is something wrong?

32
00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:19.833
Count you kid

33
00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.700
Give me more face in the future

34
00:01:23.533 --> 00:01:26.400
This old man's turf doesn't care who's behind you

35
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.300
It's a dragon, you have to plate it for me

36
00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:30.566
It's a tiger, you have to lie down for me

37
00:01:31.733 --> 00:01:32.566
Understand

38
00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.100
Understand

39
00:01:37.066 --> 00:01:39.200
Just understand, the meeting is adjourned

40
00:01:40.666 --> 00:01:41.466
Baby
