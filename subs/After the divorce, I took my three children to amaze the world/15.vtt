Oh, dear.

2
00:00:02.466 --> 00:00:04.800
Don't shoot, don't shoot me, where did the wind neck come from?

3
00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:05.566
Actually taking children

4
00:00:05.566 --> 00:00:08.266
We must be popular if we post such a good thing online.

5
00:00:08.266 --> 00:00:10.266
Take a picture, don't take a picture, don't take a picture

6
00:00:11.366 --> 00:00:12.833
Stop shooting, do you hear me?

7
00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:24.666
Miss, I'll lend you my cell phone.

8
00:00:24.766 --> 00:00:27.233
You can call your family to pick you up.

9
00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:28.966
Thanks.

10
00:00:29.966 --> 00:00:31.500
What's your name?

11
00:00:31.566 --> 00:00:33.233
I will repay you.

12
00:00:33.566 --> 00:00:34.800
My name is Yang Chenchen

13
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.100
Don't worry about the little things

14
00:00:40.933 --> 00:00:42.900
Hello cousin

15
00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.500
I'm at the gate of Yang's house.

16
00:00:45.666 --> 00:00:47.866
Can you come and pick me up?

17
00:00:58.600 --> 00:00:59.600
Baby

18
00:01:00.133 --> 00:01:01.233
Hungry

19
00:01:02.366 --> 00:01:04.700
If you are hungry, wait for your mother to come home.

20
00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:06.400
Can I make something delicious for you?

21
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.000
Hmm dragon fruit

22
00:01:08.666 --> 00:01:09.466
Wait for me.

23
00:01:09.566 --> 00:01:10.900
I'm going to feed the children

24
00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:13.600
I want to buy one.

25
00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:15.400
scratch-off

26
00:01:16.733 --> 00:01:19.066
Why is the name Morning so familiar?

27
00:01:19.066 --> 00:01:20.633
Go back and ask the housekeeper to check.
