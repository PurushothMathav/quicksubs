00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:08.200
How could this be?

2
00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:09.633
Ok, I'll be right there

3
00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.866
Sister, where are you going in a hurry?

4
00:00:16.866 --> 00:00:18.966
I want you to keep the dog out of the way

5
00:00:18.966 --> 00:00:20.766
Get out of the way I can get out of the way

6
00:00:20.866 --> 00:00:23.666
But you can't come back when you leave.

7
00:00:23.733 --> 00:00:26.000
What do you mean, look what this is

8
00:00:34.366 --> 00:00:36.433
Company employees make trouble

9
00:00:37.333 --> 00:00:39.033
This removes me from my position

10
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:40.800
See clearly

11
00:00:40.866 --> 00:00:43.766
This is the signature of all the elders

12
00:00:43.866 --> 00:00:46.100
Can't solve this in three days

13
00:00:46.133 --> 00:00:47.966
The group is back in my hands

14
00:00:50.566 --> 00:00:51.333
What do I say?

15
00:00:51.333 --> 00:00:53.566
What have you been doing these days?

16
00:00:53.566 --> 00:00:56.000
It turned out to be a mess

17
00:00:56.533 --> 00:00:58.633
A few employees make trouble

18
00:00:58.666 --> 00:00:59.666
Not three days

19
00:00:59.666 --> 00:01:01.066
I can solve it in a day.

20
00:01:01.533 --> 00:01:03.833
You are playing house as a child

21
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:06.200
I see how you solve it in a day.

22
00:01:10.266 --> 00:01:12.800
Luo Xunmei, do you know?

23
00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:15.000
In fact, what you've always wanted

24
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.366
It's nothing to me at all

25
00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:19.566
If it weren't for my wrong last name

26
00:01:20.166 --> 00:01:21.666
Rockwell Group

27
00:01:22.666 --> 00:01:24.300
Not interested at all
