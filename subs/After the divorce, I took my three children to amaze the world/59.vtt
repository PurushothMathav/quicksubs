00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:03.533
What Tao Yu?

2
00:00:03.533 --> 00:00:05.333
Sister, how can you Tao Yu?

3
00:00:05.333 --> 00:00:06.200
Tao Yu is a felony

4
00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:07.466
The death penalty

5
00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.366
Go, I'll take you to surrender

6
00:00:09.366 --> 00:00:12.000
I don't bother you about this matter, sister.

7
00:00:12.133 --> 00:00:14.100
Did Tao Yu come back?

8
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:17.900
Your dad can call and ask Liang Chengzhu to cut

9
00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:20.900
My dad is out on business

10
00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:22.466
Now I'm in charge

11
00:00:22.466 --> 00:00:24.133
I didn't even know you went out

12
00:00:24.133 --> 00:00:25.800
How could my dad possibly know?

13
00:00:26.066 --> 00:00:27.666
Liang Gongzi, right?

14
00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.000
I suggest you call and ask your father

15
00:00:31.366 --> 00:00:33.400
Don't let anything happen then.

16
00:00:33.533 --> 00:00:35.166
It's hard to explain to your dad

17
00:00:35.166 --> 00:00:36.000
elder sister

18
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:38.600
Liang Gongzi said

19
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.500
The city lord has been on a business trip recently

20
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.800
I don't have time to mind your business

21
00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.100
I advise you

22
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.633
Turn yourself in with me

23
00:00:45.766 --> 00:00:47.166
Can save your life

24
00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.866
Mo Yanxue, your sister is all for your own good.

25
00:00:49.866 --> 00:00:51.166
You still don't thank him

26
00:00:51.166 --> 00:00:52.333
Go with him again

27
00:00:52.333 --> 00:00:54.633
At least no one else can know

28
00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.666
Luo Xuemei is my illegitimate daughter

29
00:00:56.666 --> 00:00:59.400
And Promise Snow is not my newborn daughter

30
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.666
Mom, why do you always talk to Luo Xuemei?

31
00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:04.833
Who is your biological daughter?

32
00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.300
How are you talking to me?

33
00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.066
Mom, it's for your own good too.

34
00:01:09.066 --> 00:01:11.766
You can turn yourself in and get leniency

35
00:01:11.766 --> 00:01:15.666
Sister, I know you have been living outside these years

36
00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:16.966
No one to discipline

37
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.966
Did you spend another five years in prison after coming out?

38
00:01:18.966 --> 00:01:20.266
I don't know the etiquette

39
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.266
But you can't talk to mom like that either.

40
00:01:23.266 --> 00:01:26.066
Zhao Xunmei, you are really green tea

41
00:01:26.966 --> 00:01:29.600
Okay. You guys don't call, do you?

42
00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.300
Ok I will call

43
00:01:31.566 --> 00:01:33.466
I'll ask City Lord Liang

44
00:01:33.866 --> 00:01:35.266
Is he a fugitive?

45
00:01:39.466 --> 00:01:40.266
Hello

46
00:01:42.066 --> 00:01:43.300
What are you?

47
00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:44.700
How could I have my dad's phone number?

48
00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.000
God Emperor is not good

49
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.200
The Emperor is in danger

50
00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:47.600
That is.

51
00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.866
I suspect this fugitive is calling his accomplice

52
00:01:49.866 --> 00:01:51.400
Quickly try this fugitive
