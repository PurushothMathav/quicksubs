00:00:02.333 --> 00:00:05.266
Mom, that's what I've been called since I was a kid

2
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.966
I have always regarded you as my biological mother

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.700
But when did you consider me your own daughter?

4
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.966
I'm not even as good as this adopted daughter

5
00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:16.733
Mom was wrong

6
00:00:16.733 --> 00:00:18.500
Mom will be nice to you in the future, okay?

7
00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:20.366
Don't doubt whether your mother is good or not.

8
00:00:20.366 --> 00:00:22.100
I'm really your mother

9
00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:22.900
Mom

10
00:00:23.466 --> 00:00:25.133
I just suspected Luoxue before

11
00:00:25.133 --> 00:00:26.766
Is May your illegitimate daughter?

12
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.266
You're reacting so violently right now

13
00:00:29.533 --> 00:00:30.100
I arrive

14
00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:33.266
I wonder if I'm your biological daughter

15
00:00:34.366 --> 00:00:35.300
Liang Yunsong

16
00:00:35.866 --> 00:00:39.300
Take it for a paternity test together?

17
00:00:39.866 --> 00:00:42.100
You just wanted to be me and Xunmei before

18
00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:43.700
Paternity test?

19
00:00:43.866 --> 00:00:46.466
Yes, you hit it yourself.

20
00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.266
If I find something wrong with my paternity report

21
00:00:50.566 --> 00:00:52.700
Then it's not up to me.

22
00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:54.900
Take away yes

23
00:00:55.766 --> 00:00:56.700
Please mom

24
00:01:04.566 --> 00:01:05.933
Miss no

25
00:01:05.933 --> 00:01:06.733
Emperor

26
00:01:06.933 --> 00:01:08.700
What should we do next, Lord God Emperor?

27
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.366
You first transfer some people from Tongzhong

28
00:01:11.366 --> 00:01:13.066
Total control of the property market group

29
00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.400
Check the previous accounts carefully

30
00:01:15.966 --> 00:01:18.866
In the past few years after my father's death, it was all about Luo Xunmei

31
00:01:18.866 --> 00:01:22.266
Sir, I don't trust him
