00:00:02.366 --> 00:00:04.633
Shut up, why are you everywhere?

2
00:00:04.733 --> 00:00:06.900
Last time, you stole Shanshan's data report.

3
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:09.166
This time I want to steal Shanshan's advertising plan again

4
00:00:09.466 --> 00:00:12.700
Manager Chen, this plan is really made by me

5
00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:14.900
Yao Qianchen

6
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.333
You didn't even go to college

7
00:00:17.333 --> 00:00:19.166
How could it be possible to make such a good plan

8
00:00:19.266 --> 00:00:20.766
Still trying to take my credit

9
00:00:21.366 --> 00:00:23.166
I think you are daydreaming

10
00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.900
That's right, Yang Jianchen, stop being unreasonable

11
00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.600
We all saw it. That's what Shanshan did.

12
00:00:29.466 --> 00:00:30.866
You go through the back door

13
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.600
What else can you do besides stealing credit from others?

14
00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.166
Did you see that Shanshan could go to the cocktail party?

15
00:00:34.166 --> 00:00:35.266
Are you jealous?

16
00:00:35.533 --> 00:00:36.766
Then he must be jealous

17
00:00:36.766 --> 00:00:39.366
To know the reception of the head office of Shenwei Group

18
00:00:39.366 --> 00:00:41.233
That's a rich business

19
00:00:41.733 --> 00:00:42.800
He's a stinky eater

20
00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.200
I definitely want to meet more rich women

21
00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.466
Otherwise, how will he eat this soft rice in the future?

22
00:00:47.266 --> 00:00:48.633
You're going too far.

23
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.433
Wantonly steal the credit of colleagues

24
00:00:51.466 --> 00:00:53.400
Unwarranted humiliation of me

25
00:00:53.866 --> 00:00:55.766
Aren't you afraid I'll sue?

26
00:00:55.766 --> 00:00:57.033
Haha tell

27
00:00:57.333 --> 00:00:59.200
Go and sue me to see

28
00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.633
Who cares about you, a little intern?

29
00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:03.633
I'm your immediate boss

30
00:01:03.933 --> 00:01:05.966
Believe it or not, I'll fire you in minutes?

31
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.700
It's Yang Qianchen

32
00:01:08.733 --> 00:01:10.600
A waste that doesn't understand soft rice

33
00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:11.866
I still want to go to the party

34
00:01:11.866 --> 00:01:12.900
Are you bah

35
00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:15.900
Who is Yang Qianchen?

36
00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:17.600
What's wrong with me?

37
00:01:17.933 --> 00:01:20.400
This is the invitation letter prepared by the head office tomorrow.

38
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.900
The emotions invited by Mr. Du
