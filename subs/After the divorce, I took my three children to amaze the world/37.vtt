00:00:02.066 --> 00:00:02.900
Lu Shanshan

2
00:00:03.466 --> 00:00:04.833
What are you doing here?

3
00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:06.766
Shanshan, you know each other?

4
00:00:07.333 --> 00:00:09.666
Of course I know

5
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.600
If it weren't for Yang Qianchen saving Luo Yingxue back then

6
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.233
How could I be so embarrassed?

7
00:00:14.566 --> 00:00:16.200
I can't deal with Luo Yingxue

8
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.666
I can't deal with you, a little Yang Qianchen

9
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.800
Shanshan, do you two have a grudge?

10
00:00:21.966 --> 00:00:23.900
Do you want me to help you teach him a lesson?

11
00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.033
Is there some hatred?

12
00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:30.833
Yang Qianchen didn't even go to college as far as I know

13
00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:33.033
How could it be possible to work in any group

14
00:00:33.366 --> 00:00:35.766
Is Mo allowed to open the back door for you?

15
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:36.533
What!

16
00:00:36.533 --> 00:00:39.100
It turned out to be a waste who eats soft rice and goes through the back door

17
00:00:39.166 --> 00:00:41.566
What do I take it for?

18
00:00:41.566 --> 00:00:43.833
It turned out to be a trash who didn't even go to college

19
00:00:46.666 --> 00:00:48.100
I didn't go to college.

20
00:00:48.366 --> 00:00:50.500
But I have taught myself all the courses

21
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.000
Also passed the Adult College Entrance Exam

22
00:00:52.366 --> 00:00:53.766
Why do you look down on me?

23
00:00:53.766 --> 00:00:55.366
What adult college entrance examination

24
00:00:55.566 --> 00:00:56.900
And face to say

25
00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.600
You can ask other colleagues in the company.

26
00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.600
Who hasn't been to college?

27
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.333
Since you came in through the back door after eating

28
00:01:02.333 --> 00:01:04.100
Just stay in the corner for me

29
00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.033
Don't go out and embarrass our department

30
00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:09.800
Why do you want to hit me?

31
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.500
Come on, fight

32
00:01:12.466 --> 00:01:13.300
No way.

33
00:01:14.066 --> 00:01:16.300
I can't cause trouble on my first day in the company

34
00:01:16.566 --> 00:01:18.200
Shame on Luo Ying
