00:00:02.666 --> 00:00:05.566
What are you, Mr. He Tian?

2
00:00:05.566 --> 00:00:06.366
You know me?

3
00:00:06.366 --> 00:00:07.533
More than just knowing?

4
00:00:07.533 --> 00:00:09.566
Teacher He, you are my idol

5
00:00:09.966 --> 00:00:11.000
I've heard you speak.

6
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.366
It was so good.

7
00:00:12.366 --> 00:00:14.433
Solved my problem for years

8
00:00:14.466 --> 00:00:16.066
Wang Feng, what are you doing?

9
00:00:16.066 --> 00:00:17.733
Liang Gongzi, sorry

10
00:00:17.733 --> 00:00:19.166
Suddenly I saw my idol

11
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:20.300
A little out of control

12
00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.233
It's better to know where you stand

13
00:00:22.266 --> 00:00:23.800
Yes I understand

14
00:00:23.966 --> 00:00:26.900
Is there a problem with the Hequan Group project?

15
00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.900
Luo always has

16
00:00:31.066 --> 00:00:34.200
You see, everything done here is fake.

17
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:35.500
It's very secretive.

18
00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.400
People who don't have the ability can't see it at all

19
00:00:39.533 --> 00:00:41.033
Good good Luo Xuemei

20
00:00:41.166 --> 00:00:43.300
The hole you dug for me is here, right?

21
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.133
What does this have to do with me?

22
00:00:45.133 --> 00:00:47.200
You obviously made the fake account yourself.

23
00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.766
Did Wang Feng hear it?

24
00:00:49.766 --> 00:00:51.433
Don't take Luo Yingxue away

25
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.466
Mr. Luo

26
00:00:53.466 --> 00:00:55.466
Since there is a problem with the account of the rule group

27
00:00:55.466 --> 00:00:58.166
Then please come with me, hahaha.

28
00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:59.233
Luoxue

29
00:00:59.333 --> 00:01:01.900
Are you really shooting yourself in the foot?

30
00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:03.400
Don't worry about Luo

31
00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:05.166
After careful comparison

32
00:01:05.166 --> 00:01:06.700
All these accounting issues

33
00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.600
It all existed last year

34
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.233
Mr. Luo, guess what?

35
00:01:10.533 --> 00:01:12.733
I just became the president of the group for a few days

36
00:01:12.733 --> 00:01:14.566
How could it be him?
