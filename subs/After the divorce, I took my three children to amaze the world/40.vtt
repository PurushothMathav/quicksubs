00:00:02.766 --> 00:00:04.066
Are you sure about that?

2
00:00:05.666 --> 00:00:07.200
There's a meeting coming up soon.

3
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.033
Can you take responsibility if something goes wrong?

4
00:00:10.066 --> 00:00:11.733
I'm sure I did it.

5
00:00:11.733 --> 00:00:12.833
5Am

6
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.700
Processed all the data

7
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:15.833
The report has been completed.

8
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.100
Are you all here?

9
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.200
Come to the conference room for a meeting

10
00:00:34.166 --> 00:00:36.900
All the data reports you were asked to do were done

11
00:00:37.133 --> 00:00:38.200
It's done.

12
00:00:44.733 --> 00:00:46.066
Yeah, might as well.

13
00:00:46.066 --> 00:00:46.800
detailed data

14
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:47.666
No mistakes or omissions

15
00:00:47.666 --> 00:00:49.000
The analysis is also well-founded

16
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.600
It's a very high-quality report.

17
00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.100
Who did it? Of course it was Shanshan.

18
00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:53.900
Manager Chen

19
00:00:53.933 --> 00:00:55.933
Shanshan's work ability is too strong

20
00:00:55.933 --> 00:00:56.766
There is no time.

21
00:00:56.766 --> 00:00:58.600
You've processed all the data.

22
00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.066
What kind of reports do they put together?

23
00:01:00.066 --> 00:01:01.233
Is it Shanshan?

24
00:01:01.933 --> 00:01:03.366
You said earlier that you have this ability

25
00:01:03.366 --> 00:01:05.300
I made you the head of the department directly

26
00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.033
What are you doing as an intern?

27
00:01:07.133 --> 00:01:08.100
Manager Chen

28
00:01:08.733 --> 00:01:11.066
I also want to start at the grassroots level

29
00:01:11.333 --> 00:01:12.800
Supervisor from the beginning

30
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.233
There will definitely be people who are not convinced
