00:00:02.533 --> 00:00:05.300
Cousin, the new product you designed is about to hit the market.

2
00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:07.766
This is the advertising plan designed by each department

3
00:00:08.366 --> 00:00:09.633
Which one is better?

4
00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:12.300
Also the final winner

5
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.166
He will say that he wants to attend the reception held by the head office tomorrow.

6
00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:18.000
OK, let me see.

7
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.666
This plan is not bad

8
00:00:22.866 --> 00:00:24.433
Who did this?

9
00:00:26.733 --> 00:00:27.600
Los cedars

10
00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:30.800
Why is he in the aesthetic group?

11
00:00:31.266 --> 00:00:34.466
The one who used your identity?

12
00:00:35.466 --> 00:00:36.500
I'll call and ask

13
00:00:37.266 --> 00:00:38.166
No.

14
00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.500
Someone who can come up with such an excellent plan

15
00:00:41.933 --> 00:00:44.200
It shows that he is still a bit talented

16
00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.600
Can't be beaten to death with a stick

17
00:00:47.866 --> 00:00:48.800
Oh, right.

18
00:00:49.466 --> 00:00:51.633
Put someone in for me at the reception

19
00:00:51.733 --> 00:00:53.266
Call Yang Qianchen on purpose

20
00:00:53.533 --> 00:00:54.900
Will you save your daughter's mother?

21
00:00:55.966 --> 00:00:58.066
Ok, I'll marry you now.

22
00:00:59.066 --> 00:01:00.500
Do I have to go first?

23
00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:01.466
Wait cousin

24
00:01:02.566 --> 00:01:05.400
Master and uncle, they all want you back

25
00:01:06.266 --> 00:01:08.666
The child didn't wait for the idea, okay?

26
00:01:08.666 --> 00:01:09.400
Oh, I see.

27
00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.466
I'll go back when I'm done with this while

28
00:01:15.533 --> 00:01:16.533
Shanshan, my advertisement

29
00:01:16.533 --> 00:01:18.200
The plan has been approved by the head office.

30
00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.966
What meeting can you attend tomorrow?

31
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.066
Really? Thank you, Prime Minister Chen.

32
00:01:22.066 --> 00:01:23.300
Thank me for what?

33
00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:24.900
Shanshan, your work ability is strong.

34
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.766
Isn't that my work plan?

35
00:01:32.966 --> 00:01:34.833
How did it become Los Angeles?
