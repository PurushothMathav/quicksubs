00:00:03.866 --> 00:00:04.833
What are you doing?

2
00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:06.100
Such a nice stool

3
00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:07.333
Why are you the one going through the back door?

4
00:00:07.333 --> 00:00:08.900
Made of waste that eats soft rice

5
00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:10.600
That's for you.

6
00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.033
Luo Shanshan's backstage is Manager Chen

7
00:00:23.466 --> 00:00:25.800
If I could help him fix this kid

8
00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.200
It is not easy to get promoted and raised in the future

9
00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:30.866
Your name is Fang Yunfeng, right?

10
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:32.333
Nice work.

11
00:00:32.333 --> 00:00:34.833
I will listen to your good words in front of Manager Chen.

12
00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:36.300
Thank you, Shanshan.

13
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.700
I will keep up the good work.

14
00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:39.700
No way.

15
00:00:39.766 --> 00:00:42.400
I can't let Fang Yufeng steal my thunder

16
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.333
Shanshan, your information

17
00:00:45.333 --> 00:00:47.300
Why don't you let Yang Qianleng handle it?

18
00:00:47.366 --> 00:00:48.066
Just take a look

19
00:00:48.066 --> 00:00:49.300
This illiterate person who didn't go to college

20
00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:50.200
Can you do this?

21
00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.133
Okay, look, you're right

22
00:00:53.133 --> 00:00:55.700
Then give it all to Yang Qianleng

23
00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.633
This is the company's sales data for the last quarter

24
00:00:59.866 --> 00:01:02.500
Finish sorting out the report and send it to me before get off work.

25
00:01:02.566 --> 00:01:04.966
How can I possibly finish so much?

26
00:01:05.533 --> 00:01:06.666
Sure enough, he is a piece of trash

27
00:01:06.666 --> 00:01:09.000
I started picking and choosing before I even started work

28
00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:11.966
Here are some more.

29
00:01:11.966 --> 00:01:14.366
This is the company's purchasing data for the last quarter

30
00:01:14.366 --> 00:01:15.866
Do it all for me today

31
00:01:16.066 --> 00:01:17.000
Why?

32
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.900
Is that how much work one person does in a day?
