00:00:03.933 --> 00:00:05.500
You are the new intern

2
00:00:05.733 --> 00:00:07.433
It's you who has an opinion on Shanshan

3
00:00:08.533 --> 00:00:09.333
Manager Chen

4
00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:12.233
I don't disagree with anyone, but these data reports

5
00:00:12.666 --> 00:00:14.033
I did it all by myself.

6
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:16.066
It has nothing to do with Luo Shanshan

7
00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:17.200
What!

8
00:00:17.866 --> 00:00:18.866
How come?

9
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:19.900
You want money? Get up!

10
00:00:19.933 --> 00:00:21.133
Are you talking nonsense?

11
00:00:21.133 --> 00:00:23.466
Just you, who didn't even go to college

12
00:00:23.466 --> 00:00:24.733
How could it be so short?

13
00:00:24.733 --> 00:00:25.733
Just put so many reports

14
00:00:25.733 --> 00:00:26.566
It's all done.

15
00:00:26.566 --> 00:00:28.466
It's Manager Chen, don't be deceived by him.

16
00:00:28.466 --> 00:00:30.400
He's just a loser eating dinner at the headquarters door

17
00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:31.500
Lack of mental energy all day

18
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:32.866
Want to get your attention?

19
00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.333
Is what they say true?

20
00:00:35.333 --> 00:00:37.966
Manager Chen, I didn't go to any university.

21
00:00:37.966 --> 00:00:39.600
But I have read

22
00:00:41.166 --> 00:00:43.400
Say whose back door you went through

23
00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:44.933
How dare you treat someone with such a low education

24
00:00:44.933 --> 00:00:46.366
Assigned to my department

25
00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:47.200
i

26
00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.233
I can't tell the relationship with Luo Yingxue

27
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.400
I have to rely on my own strength

28
00:00:52.733 --> 00:00:54.100
Receive recognition from colleagues

29
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.200
Dare to do it or not, Mr. Yao

30
00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.766
You really deserve to be accused of eating soft rice

31
00:00:59.666 --> 00:01:00.466
Manager Chen

32
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:02.366
I didn't go through anyone's back door

33
00:01:02.666 --> 00:01:04.566
I just want to rely on my own strength

34
00:01:04.566 --> 00:01:05.800
In Shenmen Group

35
00:01:05.933 --> 00:01:07.166
Stand on your feet

36
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.566
I did all these reports by myself.

37
