1
00:00:02.533 --> 00:00:03.600
That's impossible.

2
00:00:03.866 --> 00:00:05.466
It's not that the reception is only an invitation

3
00:00:05.466 --> 00:00:07.000
Is the program the best employee?

4
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.233
Why would he go?

5
00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:10.400
Who are you?

6
00:00:10.466 --> 00:00:13.200
Don't be this soft rice man who invited you to act

7
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.500
Yeah?

8
00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:16.266
How dare you pretend to be someone from Shenwei Group?

9
00:00:16.266 --> 00:00:17.433
Don't want to mix it up

10
00:00:17.466 --> 00:00:18.700
Shut up for me

11
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.633
I'm Dong Du's secretary

12
00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:24.633
Do you need me to ask Du Dong to answer the phone to get the coupon identity?

13
00:00:24.933 --> 00:00:25.766
Du Dong

14
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:27.466
Du Dong

15
00:00:27.466 --> 00:00:30.633
Why would you pay attention to a little intern?

16
00:00:30.733 --> 00:00:32.033
What's the situation?

17
00:00:32.166 --> 00:00:34.966
Could it be that Roy Xue really pays attention to Yang Qianchen?

18
00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.566
What, does Manager Chen have a problem with Dong Du?

19
00:00:38.566 --> 00:00:40.266
You can tell me if you have anything.

20
00:00:40.266 --> 00:00:42.366
I'll pass it on to Dong Du.

21
00:00:42.366 --> 00:00:43.066
How come?

22
00:00:43.066 --> 00:00:45.033
Why would I have a problem with Dong Du?

23
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.266
Just hum

24
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:48.700
No opinion

25
00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:49.800
Wait, Secretary Lin

26
00:00:49.866 --> 00:00:51.033
Please answer this.

27
00:00:51.333 --> 00:00:52.833
You'd better cancel the customs immediately.

28
00:00:53.266 --> 00:00:55.700
Don't you want to attend the head office tomorrow?

29
00:00:55.766 --> 00:00:56.366
Will they?

30
00:00:56.366 --> 00:00:59.566
You know, it's full of plutocrats and elites.

31
00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.033
celebrities from all walks of life

32
00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:02.166
Make friends with one or two

33
00:01:02.166 --> 00:01:04.500
You'll be great in your life

34
00:01:04.666 --> 00:01:07.266
This request has changed, I know it is the first

35
00:01:08.066 --> 00:01:09.733
But I don't want to owe him a favor

36
00:01:09.733 --> 00:01:10.633
and

37
00:01:11.166 --> 00:01:13.200
I don't want to rely on so-called connections

38
00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:14.400
hit the road

39
00:01:15.266 --> 00:01:17.566
I want to work hard step by step by myself

40
00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:18.633
Slowly surround
