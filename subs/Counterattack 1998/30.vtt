1
00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:04.966
Several, two, three sets

2
00:00:05.066 --> 00:00:08.000
It stands to reason that an average of 600 bottles.

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.700
Better 800 bottles

4
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.066
The contract is signed

5
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.033
Three sets

6
00:00:13.566 --> 00:00:14.366
Too few.

7
00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:15.766
Wait a minute.

8
00:00:16.333 --> 00:00:18.200
Someone will definitely come again

9
00:00:18.333 --> 00:00:20.766
Then let's go upstairs again

10
00:00:20.933 --> 00:00:21.966
Okay, okay.

11
00:00:22.466 --> 00:00:25.266
Brother, why don't you wait a few more days?

12
00:00:25.333 --> 00:00:27.666
I guess all the money should be spent

13
00:00:27.666 --> 00:00:29.833
Why should we talk to them?

14
00:00:30.066 --> 00:00:32.300
It won't be too late

15
00:00:32.333 --> 00:00:33.400
What time, sir?

16
00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:36.366
Then you will know

17
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.233
That's right, it's coming with me

18
00:00:40.066 --> 00:00:41.700
You're right to listen to me

19
00:00:42.166 --> 00:00:43.366
Come sooner or later

20
00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.500
Why can't you help but buy it again?

21
00:00:50.566 --> 00:00:53.833
Let's start with the ordinary 1,600.

22
00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:55.300
Better 2,000.

23
00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:56.666
A lot of money

24
00:00:56.666 --> 00:00:57.900
To bargain

25
00:00:58.466 --> 00:01:00.233
Open your mouth

26
00:01:00.333 --> 00:01:01.800
Ordinary 600.

27
00:01:01.933 --> 00:01:03.266
Better 800

28
00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:04.900
Not many places.

29
00:01:04.933 --> 00:01:06.300
outdated

30
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:07.966
Yo Yo Yo Yo

31
00:01:07.966 --> 00:01:09.566
Open your eyes and talk nonsense

32
00:01:09.566 --> 00:01:11.566
You think this house is cabbage

33
00:01:15.366 --> 00:01:19.000
Come on, open your eyes and show me clearly

34
00:01:19.733 --> 00:01:20.666
Press Yuxi

35
00:01:21.133 --> 00:01:23.866
We all have a big share of your house

36
00:01:33.166 --> 00:01:34.066
These traitors

37
00:01:34.066 --> 00:01:36.466
He secretly sold the house

38
00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.766
Uncle, this contract is really fake

39
00:01:39.766 --> 00:01:41.100
You go ask these people

40
00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:43.700
Fake good

41
00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.200
I'll ask first

42
00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:46.566
Go go go go

43
00:01:46.566 --> 00:01:48.233
Fake must be fake

44
00:01:49.266 --> 00:01:50.566
This is outside.
