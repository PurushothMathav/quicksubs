00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:04.500
You agree?

2
00:00:04.733 --> 00:00:06.400
Make a little money

3
00:00:06.666 --> 00:00:07.800
Otherwise

4
00:00:08.666 --> 00:00:10.666
Can you wait for bankruptcy?

5
00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:11.700
Grandpa

6
00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.133
We got a head start on all your plans

7
00:00:15.133 --> 00:00:17.566
You have no way out.

8
00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.733
If you kneel down and kowtow to us now and apologize

9
00:00:20.733 --> 00:00:23.300
I can mercifully reward you with one.

10
00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:24.666
Let your pants

11
00:00:24.933 --> 00:00:26.033
Excuse me.

12
00:00:26.933 --> 00:00:30.133
I'm not even going to give you a pair of panties

13
00:00:30.133 --> 00:00:31.200
Give me the cigar

14
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:32.600
Yo

15
00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.000
Dog stuff, what do you compare to our cigars?

16
00:00:36.333 --> 00:00:38.833
Our cigars belong to the gods now

17
00:00:39.266 --> 00:00:43.100
It can easily crush your tiger to death.

18
00:00:44.266 --> 00:00:46.500
The first brother's connection is all lit up

19
00:00:51.366 --> 00:00:52.166
everyone

20
00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:55.166
Today is Xu Changsheng's birthday

21
00:00:55.466 --> 00:00:58.633
I'm going to show you a mine shoveling show.

22
00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:00.666
Mr. Xu is not good

23
00:01:01.466 --> 00:01:03.466
The eggplant above has been planned recently.

24
00:01:03.466 --> 00:01:05.300
The rock well we bought earlier

25
00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:06.366
It's all gone.

26
00:01:06.366 --> 00:01:07.200
Not at all

27
00:01:07.466 --> 00:01:10.166
It's okay, just a little mistake

28
00:01:11.766 --> 00:01:12.533
Mr. Zhu is not good

29
00:01:12.533 --> 00:01:14.466
We used to collect ancient coins in Dayetian

30
00:01:14.466 --> 00:01:15.800
Wait a minute, it fell a thousand times

31
00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:16.900
Worthless
