The organizers have marked this basis.

29
00:01:01.866 --> 00:01:02.900
Because of flaws

30
00:01:02.966 --> 00:01:06.300
So you have to be careful while filming

00:01:06.766 --> 00:01:09.000
Because it's just a spliced piece of junk.

32
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.066
Who pays for this stuff?

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:13.033
