00:00:02.466 --> 00:00:06.000
What I have in my hands is an authentic and lonely one

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.433
Little brother, this is a bad joke

3
00:00:08.566 --> 00:00:10.600
What you just bought is Lin's.

4
00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:12.400
Which is the original work of Tang Yin?

5
00:00:12.733 --> 00:00:14.366
Don't say I don't have this store?

6
00:00:14.366 --> 00:00:16.500
He doesn't have this whole Gu'an street

7
00:00:16.566 --> 00:00:19.066
Then boss, you have to take a good look at him.

8
00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:20.366
Tang Bohu's sunset

9
00:00:20.366 --> 00:00:22.766
You have to ask about the authenticity of the official head, right?

10
00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.600
See the painting fairy see chapter

11
00:00:29.066 --> 00:00:32.766
You see the words Tang Yin Bohu here

12
00:00:32.766 --> 00:00:34.033
It's true at a glance

13
00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:35.166
That's not possible.

14
00:00:35.933 --> 00:00:37.800
Isn't Sadako novel?

15
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.233
Humph boss

16
00:00:39.566 --> 00:00:40.866
If I'm right

17
00:00:40.866 --> 00:00:43.866
Did you receive this painting from an old farmer?

18
00:00:44.533 --> 00:00:47.000
Because it's well protected and brand new.

19
00:00:47.166 --> 00:00:48.666
Everyone thought he was Linde

20
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.633
But it's genuine.

21
00:00:51.866 --> 00:00:54.566
And then there's the research.

22
00:00:55.066 --> 00:00:56.966
Here, let me see.

23
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:03.600
Really?

24
00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:05.866
It's true.

25
00:01:11.133 --> 00:01:13.500
God it's true

26
00:01:14.133 --> 00:01:15.233
Save Mengcheng

27
00:01:16.266 --> 00:01:20.800
I actually sold Uncle Tang's plan for 2,000 yuan

28
00:01:22.733 --> 00:01:25.566
Mr. Wang, this painting is now yours.

29
00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.600
Congratulations on your painting.

30
00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:28.400
Oh, dear.

31
00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:32.566
I wanted to thank you by buying flowers

32
00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.066
Look at a sentence from yesterday

33
00:01:35.066 --> 00:01:37.066
Saved our lives.

34
00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.200
Oh, by the way, where do you have my business card?

35
00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.833
You can contact me anytime if you have anything in the future.

36
00:01:42.933 --> 00:01:44.700
Let's eat first today

37
00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.133
I've made a deal with you as a friend.

38
00:01:46.133 --> 00:01:48.400
Go well another day

39
00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:49.700
I have something to do today

40
00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:52.966
Leaf is bad

41
00:01:52.966 --> 00:01:54.833
Xiaoxue was captured by Brother Tiger
