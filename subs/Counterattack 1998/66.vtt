00:00:02.566 --> 00:00:04.600
Can you give me another chance?

2
00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:05.866
I'm really sorry.

3
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:06.966
I live far away.

4
00:00:06.966 --> 00:00:08.966
Sun, you don't need to explain

5
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.266
The secretary I want is to solve big problems for the boss.

6
00:00:12.266 --> 00:00:14.600
Instead of causing trouble for the boss, go out

7
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:16.966
The whole person is also applying for a secretary

8
00:00:16.966 --> 00:00:18.633
Apply for a cleaning job

9
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.566
That's right, that's him.

10
00:00:23.066 --> 00:00:24.600
I didn't expect to live again

11
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.433
We can meet again

12
00:00:39.066 --> 00:00:40.266
Sorry.

13
00:00:42.333 --> 00:00:43.233
Wait a minute.

14
00:00:44.466 --> 00:00:45.666
You are hired.

15
00:00:45.866 --> 00:00:48.633
You mean me?
