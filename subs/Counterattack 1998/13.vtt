00:00:10.966 --> 00:00:12.400
Why are you here?

2
00:00:13.966 --> 00:00:15.300
Xiaoxue is sick

3
00:00:15.666 --> 00:00:17.000
acute leukemia

4
00:00:17.666 --> 00:00:18.866
He needs a bone marrow transplant

5
00:00:19.866 --> 00:00:22.100
What does his illness have to do with us?

6
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.966
Let him marry a rich man and die

7
00:00:24.966 --> 00:00:26.566
I have to marry you, poor man

8
00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.100
He should be alive

9
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.166
You deserve it

10
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.566
And I said, "Don't stop."

11
00:00:33.566 --> 00:00:35.500
I'm going to work, right?

12
00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.366
Get as far away from my house as possible

13
00:00:43.466 --> 00:00:44.266
Dad?

14
00:00:44.966 --> 00:00:47.666
Mom, you have a show to hit me

15
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.700
Xiaoxue is your daughter after all

16
00:00:50.766 --> 00:00:52.466
We don't have such a daughter

17
00:00:52.466 --> 00:00:54.966
Go away I don't want to see you

18
00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:57.200
roll

19
00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:59.033
Can your ears move?

20
00:01:06.166 --> 00:01:07.500
I won't let you go in vain

21
00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.700
Go for a trial match and I'll give 50,000

22
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.700
As long as the match is successful

23
00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.233
I'll give you 300,000 after the bone marrow transplant

24
00:01:15.466 --> 00:01:18.366
You are so poor that you almost beg for food

25
00:01:18.466 --> 00:01:20.066
You 50,000 300,000

26
00:01:20.066 --> 00:01:21.566
Are you fooling the ghost?

27
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.000
50,000 block

28
00:01:25.766 --> 00:01:26.900
I'll give it to you now.

29
00:01:27.566 --> 00:01:29.200
No matter what the match is

30
00:01:29.966 --> 00:01:31.466
As long as you go

31
00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.600
Mom, there's a bowl

32
00:01:44.333 --> 00:01:47.366
Let's say first that if the matching is unsuccessful

33
00:01:47.366 --> 00:01:49.366
How can I refund this money?

34
00:01:49.366 --> 00:01:51.266
No need to go backwards

35
00:01:51.866 --> 00:01:53.300
Let's try it
