00:00:06.566 --> 00:00:08.266
How're things going?

2
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.366
It's half done

3
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:16.766
It's a pity that I didn't make that bitch Huang Xue angry to death

4
00:00:16.866 --> 00:00:17.866
Otherwise

5
00:00:18.266 --> 00:00:22.100
It doesn't matter if Li Yi and the royal family break up completely

6
00:00:22.666 --> 00:00:24.533
Just wipe your butt clean

7
00:00:24.533 --> 00:00:26.100
Huang Xue doesn't have that bitch

8
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:27.400
I keep it

9
00:00:27.966 --> 00:00:29.766
Don't break it for me.

10
00:00:30.066 --> 00:00:30.900
Don't worry.

11
00:00:31.866 --> 00:00:32.800
That's right.

12
00:00:34.666 --> 00:00:36.233
Hey, Brother Tiger

13
00:00:37.933 --> 00:00:39.366
This is a reward for you.

14
00:00:39.366 --> 00:00:40.600
Take it and paint

15
00:00:54.733 --> 00:00:57.433
Let's fire him up now

16
00:00:58.366 --> 00:01:00.900
The royal family and Li Yi colluded with each other

17
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.566
Li Yi fucks with men and women

18
00:01:03.566 --> 00:01:05.933
Disrupt the business environment in Jiangcheng

19
00:01:05.933 --> 00:01:07.033
heinous crime

20
00:01:07.133 --> 00:01:08.766
Everyone gets it and stops

21
00:01:09.133 --> 00:01:09.933
flame

22
00:01:10.666 --> 00:01:13.566
You're a little too young to fight with me

23
00:01:15.333 --> 00:01:17.766
Hey, Mr. Huang, little brother

24
00:01:17.966 --> 00:01:19.066
I'm getting ready

25
00:01:19.066 --> 00:01:22.100
Let Yan'er go to the hospital to kowtow to the head blood and admit his mistake?

26
00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.200
You said it didn't cut you

27
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.700
Did such a shameless thing and kowtowed and admitted his mistake

28
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.400
Your Majesty, do you want Xiaoxue to die quickly?

29
00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.500
He explained it after he left.

30
00:01:35.266 --> 00:01:37.866
Why apologize for something you haven't done?

31
00:01:39.133 --> 00:01:40.400
What does that mean?

32
00:01:41.966 --> 00:01:45.100
What about Huang Yan? Ask him to come out and lend me.

33
00:01:45.133 --> 00:01:46.000
He is in the house

34
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.033
I'm going to call him out now.

35
00:01:48.166 --> 00:01:49.366
I'll go with you.

36
00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.000
Yang Er

37
00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:54.900
Yang Er, open the door

38
00:01:54.933 --> 00:01:55.333
This is the first.

39
00:01:55.333 --> 00:01:56.233
There you are.

40
00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.200
If you have anything to say, let's come out and talk about it

41
00:01:59.766 --> 00:02:01.066
What is there to say?

42
00:02:01.066 --> 00:02:02.500
I'm sleepy and need to rest.

43
00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.166
Huang Yan, you hide from me

44
00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.866
Believe it or not, I killed your emperor
