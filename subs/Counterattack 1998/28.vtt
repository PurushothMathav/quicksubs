00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:02.900
Give him too much collection

2
00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:03.566
Should have given more money

3
00:00:03.566 --> 00:00:04.000
Can't come back

4
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.966
Let's talk about the situation just arranged, right?

5
00:00:05.966 --> 00:00:07.833
Hey, it's coming, it's coming.

6
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:10.500
Don't worry everyone

7
00:00:10.533 --> 00:00:12.133
We have got the contract.

8
00:00:12.133 --> 00:00:15.533
You can get the money as soon as you sign the contract.

9
00:00:15.533 --> 00:00:17.500
Line up and come one by one

10
00:00:23.466 --> 00:00:26.966
Hey, by the way, your price is too expensive.

11
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:28.633
We don't sell

12
00:00:28.866 --> 00:00:30.166
What do you mean?

13
00:00:30.533 --> 00:00:33.800
The average 800 yuan a bottle as negotiated before.

14
00:00:33.966 --> 00:00:35.600
Better 1,000 bottles

15
00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.100
How to talk and still want to go out

16
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:39.633
What did you say?

17
00:00:40.133 --> 00:00:41.300
The agreement was not signed

18
00:00:41.866 --> 00:00:45.766
Just say it verbally, don't try to lie to us.

19
00:00:45.766 --> 00:00:48.233
That's it, then you applaud

20
00:00:48.766 --> 00:00:51.566
Our average 1,600.

21
00:00:51.566 --> 00:00:54.600
Better 2,000 to 2,000 bucks

22
00:00:56.766 --> 00:00:58.200
Do you have a room here too?

23
00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.966
I don't have one. But I keep saying that there is a house for sale.

24
00:01:04.733 --> 00:01:06.166
It's my treat for this meal today.

25
00:01:06.166 --> 00:01:07.566
Don't argue with me!

26
00:01:07.766 --> 00:01:10.266
Uncle is rarely so generous today

27
00:01:10.266 --> 00:01:12.033
How did you make a lot of money?

28
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.800
Don't tell me someone finally bought my two houses

29
00:01:15.866 --> 00:01:17.300
He's a big boss

30
00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:18.900
I bought a lot of houses at once

31
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.000
Which big boss is right?

32
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.700
Why did he buy your house?

33
00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.200
Do you put trash?

34
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.233
See what you say

35
00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.266
It seems to be a comparison

36
00:01:34.333 --> 00:01:37.000
Li Yi, this house is worth this price

37
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.066
You let you pay a hundred
