00:00:02.566 --> 00:00:05.766
Why are you questioning my vision?

2
00:00:08.566 --> 00:00:09.366
Xiaoyong

3
00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:11.100
This porcelain vase

4
00:00:12.166 --> 00:00:13.166
You quote a price

5
00:00:13.166 --> 00:00:14.533
I will never bargain

6
00:00:14.533 --> 00:00:15.533
first meeting

7
00:00:15.533 --> 00:00:16.566
This porcelain vase

8
00:00:16.566 --> 00:00:19.066
It was supposed to be given to you as a meeting gift.

9
00:00:19.566 --> 00:00:21.866
But I'm really desperate for money.

10
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.400
Look at the others

11
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.366
I'll take your 2 million

12
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:33.166
This one.

13
00:00:33.733 --> 00:00:36.600
Master Qiu, I heard that you are not as good as antique appreciation

14
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.200
Medicine also studies ancient writing quite a bit

15
00:00:39.266 --> 00:00:41.033
You stick your finger in and probe

16
00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.633
Maybe there will be surprises

17
00:00:43.666 --> 00:00:45.266
It's a lie

18
00:00:46.133 --> 00:00:48.666
That porcelain vase just now was just lucky

19
00:00:48.866 --> 00:00:51.266
What's so amazing about this broken box?

20
00:00:51.533 --> 00:00:53.300
If I guessed correctly

21
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:54.966
Inside this box

22
00:00:55.266 --> 00:00:56.966
Engraved with under-seat text

23
00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:58.800
How do you know that?

24
00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:01.033
Are you stealing again?

25
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.466
I came across a book once.

26
00:01:04.466 --> 00:01:06.866
It is said to be under the knee to prevent the loss of words

27
00:01:06.866 --> 00:01:08.266
They will secretly record

28
00:01:08.266 --> 00:01:09.500
Box like this

29
00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.400
Is one of the recording methods

30
00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.833
You're asking too little 2 million

31
00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.166
I 2.20 million
