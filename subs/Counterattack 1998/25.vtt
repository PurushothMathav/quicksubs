00:00:03.533 --> 00:00:06.033
Wife, take care of a hundred hearts

2
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:07.133
Sure enough

3
00:00:07.133 --> 00:00:09.800
I was seriously auctioning at the auction house in Jiangcheng

4
00:00:10.466 --> 00:00:13.100
Just lucky enough to pick up a few leaks

5
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:14.500
What I will testify

6
00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:16.000
Oh yes

7
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:17.833
Sister-in-law, don't worry.

8
00:00:17.933 --> 00:00:19.433
The money came upright

9
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.500
The first brother said he was lucky

10
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:22.700
That's modest.

11
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.200
This is definitely ghost eye level

12
00:00:25.366 --> 00:00:27.800
Just two pieces of porcelain

13
00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.200
It is actually the original on the Song Dynasty noun

14
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.900
A humble box

15
00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:34.000
There is another signature inside

16
00:00:34.333 --> 00:00:35.400
Okay, stone.

17
00:00:36.466 --> 00:00:39.000
Wife, don't listen to the nonsense of the stone

18
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.100
I was just lucky.

19
00:00:41.533 --> 00:00:42.666
Don't worry either.

20
00:00:42.666 --> 00:00:45.600
I will not indulge in the auction business

21
00:00:45.766 --> 00:00:47.166
What about entering the auction?

22
00:00:47.366 --> 00:00:49.566
Also for my next money-making plan

23
00:00:49.666 --> 00:00:50.566
accumulate funds

24
00:00:51.133 --> 00:00:53.033
The prodigal son will not be exchanged for money

25
00:00:54.866 --> 00:00:56.800
Watching you change your ways now

26
00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.166
I just closed my eyes and walked away

27
00:01:00.166 --> 00:01:02.566
Don't worry, I'll leave the child to you.

28
00:01:03.466 --> 00:01:04.266
Wife

29
00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:06.500
Don't be discouraged

30
00:01:07.133 --> 00:01:09.500
I will never let anything happen to you.

31
00:01:10.933 --> 00:01:12.233
You have a good rest first

32
00:01:20.066 --> 00:01:20.866
Dabao

33
00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.266
500,000 I already saved it

34
00:01:23.266 --> 00:01:24.400
I want to ask

35
00:01:24.566 --> 00:01:26.500
When will a matching bone marrow be found?

36
00:01:26.933 --> 00:01:28.600
We will do our best

37
00:01:28.733 --> 00:01:31.166
Business news will notify you as soon as possible.

38
00:01:31.866 --> 00:01:34.866
Ok please ok ok

39
00:01:42.166 --> 00:01:43.033
Got it.

40
00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:44.966
It's not dark yet.

41
00:01:45.333 --> 00:01:46.766
We're going upstairs

42
00:01:46.766 --> 00:01:49.666
What to do there to buy a house
