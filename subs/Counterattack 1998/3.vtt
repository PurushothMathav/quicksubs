00:00:05.666 --> 00:00:07.700
Oh, go down and have a look.

2
00:00:14.933 --> 00:00:17.266
Little brother, are you alright?

3
00:00:17.266 --> 00:00:19.866
Why don't you take my car to the hospital for a check-up?

4
00:00:19.866 --> 00:00:21.500
Steel boss Huang Jieshe

5
00:00:21.733 --> 00:00:24.100
He went to the suburbs to inspect today

6
00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:26.733
The car fell off the bridge on the way back

7
00:00:26.733 --> 00:00:27.600
Oh, I can't.

8
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.900
I still have something to do, little brother

9
00:00:31.066 --> 00:00:32.100
Here's my card.

10
00:00:32.266 --> 00:00:34.366
You can contact me anytime if you have anything.

11
00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:36.900
Mr. Huang

12
00:00:37.466 --> 00:00:38.500
Your car

13
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.866
It's better not to go on the bridge today

14
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.533
Dad, don't listen to him

15
00:00:43.533 --> 00:00:46.066
I don't know where the liar came from, ignore him

16
00:00:48.566 --> 00:00:50.700
I hope he survives.

17
00:00:51.866 --> 00:00:53.000
I have a lot to do with you

18
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.100
The boss won the lottery

19
00:00:56.566 --> 00:00:59.133
Isn't this Li Yi, a gambler from our village?

20
00:00:59.133 --> 00:01:02.300
Why don't you have money to gamble? It's time to buy a lottery ticket.

21
00:01:02.366 --> 00:01:06.033
The lottery number is 312222.

22
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.233
One-one pair is this

23
00:01:08.366 --> 00:01:11.466
Boy, this is your first time buying a lottery ticket.

24
00:01:11.533 --> 00:01:14.100
It's so heavy to choose this number.

25
00:01:14.266 --> 00:01:17.100
Funny, I've been buying lottery tickets for so many years

26
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.966
This kind of scan code has never been issued.

27
00:01:19.266 --> 00:01:22.566
Do you think it's to make up for your wife's measurements?

28
00:01:22.666 --> 00:01:23.800
This medicine can be

29
00:01:23.933 --> 00:01:27.166
I drank all the water that was poured into the water

30
00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:31.466
Ok, you can get me the water now

31
00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.300
If you win the lottery, you drink it.

32
00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:35.200
missed

33
00:01:35.666 --> 00:01:38.166
I dare to gamble

34
00:01:38.166 --> 00:01:40.233
It's the grandson who dares not gamble

35
00:01:41.066 --> 00:01:43.366
Come on, everybody watch!

36
00:01:43.466 --> 00:01:47.900
If he doesn't win the lottery in a while, let him drink the water clean

37
00:01:49.066 --> 00:01:50.066
Don't worry.

38
00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.166
It's definitely not you who drinks

39
00:01:55.933 --> 00:01:57.300
You are so lucky!

40
00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:00.300
I really won 10,000 yuan

41
00:02:04.533 --> 00:02:07.233
Say it, be willing to admit defeat
