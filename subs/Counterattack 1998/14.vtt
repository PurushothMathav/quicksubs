00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Doctor, lend me out

2
00:00:07.266 --> 00:00:08.233
With no

3
00:00:10.533 --> 00:00:11.666
The bone marrow of three people

4
00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:13.366
Neither match

5
00:00:13.933 --> 00:00:16.766
Oops we 300,000 gone

6
00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:18.666
If you don't deserve it, you don't deserve it.

7
00:00:18.666 --> 00:00:20.333
We made 50,000 bucks anyway

8
00:00:20.333 --> 00:00:21.400
We are not at a loss.

9
00:00:21.766 --> 00:00:23.833
Mom and Dad, let's go

10
00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:25.200
Long time no see

11
00:00:25.466 --> 00:00:27.300
Aren't you going in to see Xiaoxue?

12
00:00:28.266 --> 00:00:29.600
What's there to see?

13
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:31.166
Not long to live anyway

14
00:00:31.166 --> 00:00:33.700
Walk around, walk around, hospitals are full of germs

15
00:00:33.866 --> 00:00:37.033
I don't feel comfortable walking all over after staying for a long time

16
00:00:43.266 --> 00:00:44.800
Are you still human?

17
00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.366
Wife what are you doing

18
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.766
The doctor made you squat on the bed and lie down, graduate

19
00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.466
I see.

20
00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.100
Got leukemia

21
00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.000
I also know that you went to my parents

22
00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.466
You go home

23
00:01:12.466 --> 00:01:13.833
Okay, okay, don't say anything.

24
00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:15.600
Wife

25
00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.166
We should not only treat

26
00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.600
To be completely cured

27
00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:22.700
You trust me.

28
00:01:23.866 --> 00:01:25.700
I'm going to be fine.

29
00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.433
I will make a lot of money.

30
00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.666
You are in peace in the hospital waiting for treatment

31
00:01:30.933 --> 00:01:32.900
Waiting for bone marrow treatment?

32
00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.100
But no but

33
00:01:36.666 --> 00:01:38.900
Wife, you are my life

34
00:01:39.466 --> 00:01:42.266
I can't live without you
