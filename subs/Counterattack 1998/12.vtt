00:00:05.333 --> 00:00:06.133
doctor

2
00:00:06.566 --> 00:00:08.633
What happened to my wife?

3
00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.066
Why did you suddenly faint?

4
00:00:10.966 --> 00:00:12.066
Not so good.

5
00:00:12.066 --> 00:00:15.700
Your loved one has acute leukemia leukemia

6
00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:19.500
that

7
00:00:20.366 --> 00:00:21.566
Can it be cured

8
00:00:22.133 --> 00:00:23.633
He is late now.

9
00:00:24.133 --> 00:00:25.400
At present

10
00:00:25.766 --> 00:00:26.866
Drug therapy and chemotherapy

11
00:00:26.866 --> 00:00:29.033
It can only play the role of auxiliary relief

12
00:00:29.333 --> 00:00:30.633
Want to heal

13
00:00:30.866 --> 00:00:32.033
It requires myelosuppression.

14
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.233
Okay, so bone marrow transplant

15
00:00:35.366 --> 00:00:38.266
Bone marrow transplantation requires a suitable bone marrow

16
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:39.200
But

17
00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.466
At present, there are no matching pleats in the bone marrow bank.

18
00:00:43.466 --> 00:00:44.766
But don't worry.

19
00:00:44.766 --> 00:00:46.700
Our family can try it out first.

20
00:00:46.766 --> 00:00:48.433
It's actually bigger.

21
00:00:48.533 --> 00:00:50.700
Okay, okay, okay, we'll do it right away.

22
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.866
Another point is the felony

23
00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.166
This is not a small amount after all.

24
00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:57.500
Early treatment

25
00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.566
Later transplant recovery

26
00:00:59.866 --> 00:01:01.566
You can't get down without millions.

27
00:01:02.133 --> 00:01:04.066
Money is not a problem

28
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.866
Okay, you can do the matching first.

29
00:01:24.466 --> 00:01:27.300
Do I have some bad disease?

30
00:01:29.066 --> 00:01:30.033
Hey

31
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.100
What did Lao Wang say?

32
00:01:33.266 --> 00:01:35.366
It's okay, little problem.

33
00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.600
The doctor said that as long as you rest for a while, it will be fine.

34
00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:40.833
You have a good rest

35
00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.333
I went to the third sister to say this.

36
00:01:44.333 --> 00:01:45.433
I'll be right there.

37
00:01:47.533 --> 00:01:48.400
Third sister

38
00:01:49.166 --> 00:01:51.600
I'm going to Xiaoxue's parents' house

39
00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:53.100
The doctor said

40
00:01:53.133 --> 00:01:55.766
People who are related have higher video rates

41
00:01:56.066 --> 00:01:59.166
But after Xiaoxue married you back then

42
00:01:59.166 --> 00:02:01.500
Their family broke off ties with him

43
00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.333
Can this person agree?

44
00:02:03.333 --> 00:02:06.266
They beat me and scolded me, and I endured it.

45
00:02:06.666 --> 00:02:08.400
As long as it can be done 10 times for Xiaoxue

46
00:02:09.166 --> 00:02:10.300
I can do anything

47
00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:11.566
Then I'll go with you.

48
00:02:11.566 --> 00:02:13.766
No, I can do it myself.

49
00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.166
Help me take care of Xiaoxue and the children.

50
00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.066
Don't miss you
