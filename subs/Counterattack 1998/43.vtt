1
00:00:04.266 --> 00:00:06.100
turn your eyes into hatred

2
00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:08.500
So many years

3
00:00:08.966 --> 00:00:10.700
I'm sorry for you.

4
00:00:14.566 --> 00:00:17.800
Uncle Chen, our royal treatment is not poor

5
00:00:18.133 --> 00:00:20.500
I have always treated you like family

6
00:00:20.933 --> 00:00:22.633
If it weren't for my grandfather

7
00:00:22.966 --> 00:00:26.066
Your grave grass is probably three feet tall now

8
00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.966
A little kindness can't slip away from my waist all day long

9
00:00:32.533 --> 00:00:33.866
Again

10
00:00:34.533 --> 00:00:36.200
He was already sick

11
00:00:36.733 --> 00:00:38.866
Why would he hide it from everyone?

12
00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:41.233
Why should I use you to cause illness?

13
00:00:42.166 --> 00:00:45.000
It turned out to be an unfamiliar white-eyed wolf.

14
00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.766
Well, what if the queen lives a long life?

15
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.833
Early cirrhosis

16
00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:52.566
It will definitely affect daily work

17
00:00:52.566 --> 00:00:53.366
shut up

18
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.466
It's your say

19
00:00:55.533 --> 00:00:57.366
What are you?

20
00:00:57.366 --> 00:01:00.633
Just lucky enough to make a little money

21
00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:03.266
Alright everyone

22
00:01:03.533 --> 00:01:05.900
Where do I grow up?

23
00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.500
It is no longer suitable for us to learn in this member

24
00:01:08.533 --> 00:01:11.900
So I recommended my assistant to try it.

25
00:01:12.566 --> 00:01:14.633
As the new president of the Chamber of Commerce

26
00:01:15.666 --> 00:01:17.033
What are the virtues of the Xu family?

27
00:01:17.566 --> 00:01:19.400
It will be stealing chickens

28
00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.600
What qualifications does the emperor have?

29
00:01:22.766 --> 00:01:25.266
To be my father's too
