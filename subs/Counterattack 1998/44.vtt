00:00:02.566 --> 00:00:05.600
Of course, now you can turn a stick into a ghost

2
00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:07.833
The road is coming out.

3
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:11.433
I'm here, the light gun will go from top to bottom

4
00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:13.033
Please hurry up.

5
00:00:14.333 --> 00:00:17.466
Only my father can win the whole tutorial

6
00:00:17.466 --> 00:00:20.000
The rivers and lakes will be brilliant in three days

7
00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:30.366
Can't you have a place?

8
00:00:30.366 --> 00:00:31.600
We also have

9
00:00:32.666 --> 00:00:35.166
What trash that didn't pick up shit?

10
00:00:35.266 --> 00:00:36.466
I'll tell you what.

11
00:00:36.533 --> 00:00:39.300
I sold the news that the government is about to move

12
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.233
The relocation place is to the land we bought

13
00:00:42.266 --> 00:00:45.000
Then we're going to make a lot of money in heaven

14
00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:46.666
What a coincidence

15
00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:48.333
The land I bought

16
00:00:48.333 --> 00:00:50.666
It's where the government is moving.

17
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.500
Talking nonsense with dog eyes open

18
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.300
Is it the whole economy?

19
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.833
A large area was bought by our cigars

20
00:00:56.966 --> 00:00:58.133
What did you buy?

21
00:00:58.133 --> 00:01:00.766
You didn't buy a cesspool of a few square meters, did you?

22
00:01:00.766 --> 00:01:04.466
Ahahahaha

23
00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.500
I bought a mud pit in the outer ring of Jiangcheng

24
00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:12.433
Hahahaha

25
00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:13.700
Everyone listen

26
00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.600
This is unwanted junk land

27
00:01:16.666 --> 00:01:19.200
He actually said the government was moving there

28
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.000
This master is mentally ill

29
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.233
You should see a psychiatrist

30
00:01:24.333 --> 00:01:26.200
If the government doesn't move there

31
00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:27.700
I'm going to get it upside down

32
00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:30.966
All right.

33
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.833
A jumping beam clown

34
00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:38.200
There's no need to waste too much time on him

35
00:01:38.733 --> 00:01:41.766
Agree, I'll fucking choose to check out
