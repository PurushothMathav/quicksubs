1
00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.233
I just know a little bit about it.

2
00:00:04.766 --> 00:00:05.700
President Huang

3
00:00:05.966 --> 00:00:07.966
You can do more with the liver

4
00:00:07.966 --> 00:00:09.700
Is there something wrong with my liver?

5
00:00:09.966 --> 00:00:11.633
I'm not sure about that either.

6
00:00:12.166 --> 00:00:14.600
In short, there is no harm in regular inspection

7
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.400
Thanks for the reminder, little brother.

8
00:00:17.533 --> 00:00:18.800
Here it is.

9
00:00:19.466 --> 00:00:20.866
If anything happens, what?

10
00:00:20.866 --> 00:00:21.900
Just find me

11
00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.000
Including money and convenience, then thank President Wang

12
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.166
Ok, thanks.

13
00:00:29.533 --> 00:00:30.700
Ok bro

14
00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:32.566
You now have the royal family as your merchant.

15
00:00:32.566 --> 00:00:33.866
Still worried about not making money

16
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.933
But I'm not talking about you.

17
00:00:35.933 --> 00:00:37.900
Your attitude towards the imperial meeting just now

18
00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:39.066
A little cold

19
00:00:40.333 --> 00:00:41.866
Brother, let me tell you

20
00:00:41.866 --> 00:00:44.666
Human favor, this thing should be reduced once and for all.

21
00:00:44.966 --> 00:00:47.866
Relying on anyone is better than relying on yourself

22
00:00:49.733 --> 00:00:52.466
I'm not crazy, you shouldn't be crazy either

23
00:00:52.533 --> 00:00:53.966
Why did you suddenly change?

24
00:00:53.966 --> 00:00:55.066
Who is crazy?

25
00:00:56.166 --> 00:00:57.166
Haven't started yet

26
00:01:02.533 --> 00:01:06.366
Jiangcheng antique art auction officially begins

27

28

How much money do you have on you?

00:01:27.766 --> 00:01:29.000
Uh, 100,000

37
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Are you crazy?

38
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.600
You can't pay for this once it's photographed.

39
00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.000
Neither of us are leaving the auction today
