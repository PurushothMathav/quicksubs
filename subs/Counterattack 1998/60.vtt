00:00:05.166 --> 00:00:07.400
Dad, what do you want from me?

2
00:00:08.966 --> 00:00:11.833
Yan'er, do you like divorce?

3
00:00:12.166 --> 00:00:14.633
I don't have you, don't talk nonsense

4
00:00:15.133 --> 00:00:17.300
Am I talking nonsense?

5
00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:20.000
Do you like you best?

6
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.900
I'll tell you what.

7
00:00:21.066 --> 00:00:22.700
See him later

8
00:00:23.066 --> 00:00:25.433
It's good for you and good for him

9
00:00:25.533 --> 00:00:27.300
He has a wife

10
00:00:27.733 --> 00:00:30.100
Dad, if there's nothing else

11
00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:31.600
I'll go back to my room first

12
00:00:32.466 --> 00:00:34.833
Don't sign with him in the future

13
00:00:35.266 --> 00:00:36.566
Go on a blind date with me tomorrow

14
00:00:37.966 --> 00:00:40.700
Your aunt introduced you to so many people?

15
00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.900
So many sleeps will let you choose at will

16
00:00:42.933 --> 00:00:44.233
I'm not going.

17
00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:45.266
I'm still young

18
00:00:45.266 --> 00:00:46.266
I don't want to get married.

19
00:00:46.266 --> 00:00:50.166
You are still young, this man is married and the woman is married

20
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.300
If you don't believe me

21
00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:54.366
We should just hire you a door-to-door son-in-law

22
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.066
Mom

23
00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:58.500
Think about it for yourself

24
00:01:03.966 --> 00:01:04.766
Li Yi

25
00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:06.966
In your heart

26
00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.600
Do you like me a little bit?
