00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:05.566
You can't look at the surface.

2
00:00:05.933 --> 00:00:07.500
Sometimes a decision

3
00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:10.600
It can transform the development of a city

4
00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:12.400
Just buy that land

5
00:00:17.466 --> 00:00:18.266
brother

6
00:00:18.733 --> 00:00:19.700
I trust you.

7
00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:21.800
Don't worry, I'll do it.

8
00:00:23.666 --> 00:00:27.233
Husband is going to have surgery tomorrow, are you afraid?

9
00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.066
I used to be afraid

10
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:31.900
Not afraid now

11
00:00:32.466 --> 00:00:34.700
Because I know you will be with me

12
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.766
Don't worry, the doctor said the bone marrow is a good match

13
00:00:40.133 --> 00:00:41.300
What about the success rate of surgery?

14
00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.366
Almost 100%

15
00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:46.500
Li Yi

16
00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.100
Come to my office

17
00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.300
Okay, I'll go and have a look.

18
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.300
Yeah, OK.

19
00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:06.900
Doctor, what happened?

20
00:01:06.933 --> 00:01:07.733
Li Yi

21
00:01:07.966 --> 00:01:11.100
The person whose bone marrow was donated by Tang Xue has disappeared

22
00:01:12.866 --> 00:01:14.233
Lost contact

23
00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:16.700
How come?

24
00:01:17.566 --> 00:01:19.600
Isn't he also in this hospital?

25
00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.666
No, all the checks have been done

26
00:01:21.666 --> 00:01:23.400
Are you waiting for the surgery tomorrow?

27
00:01:23.466 --> 00:01:24.966
We investigated surveillance

28
00:01:25.533 --> 00:01:27.166
Before that person disappeared

29
00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:28.833
Someone met him

30
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.466
Do you know who it is?
