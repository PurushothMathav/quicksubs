00:00:02.266 --> 00:00:04.866
I spent a lot of money on this thing

2
00:00:04.966 --> 00:00:06.033
That's not necessary.

3
00:00:06.166 --> 00:00:08.033
I think you're just too suspicious

4
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:10.166
It is impossible for Secretary Wang to betray you

5
00:00:10.166 --> 00:00:12.766
Besides, you were the one who identified him in the first place

6
00:00:12.766 --> 00:00:14.833
Something is different from what I expected

7
00:00:15.266 --> 00:00:16.966
He's fine, of course

8
00:00:17.366 --> 00:00:19.433
I also don't want to miss a good rebirth

9
00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:23.366
It's so late

10
00:00:23.366 --> 00:00:24.366
Go to sleep

11
00:00:24.366 --> 00:00:27.500
Besides, can't this monitor be automatically stored?

12
00:00:27.666 --> 00:00:28.766
You go to sleep first

13
00:00:37.366 --> 00:00:39.433
I rely on him to really come

14
00:00:41.166 --> 00:00:44.200
Could it be that he forgot to take something and came back to get it?

15
00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:46.266
He has his own office

16
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.700
What is he getting from me?

17
00:00:49.133 --> 00:00:50.833
Unless it is a development plan
