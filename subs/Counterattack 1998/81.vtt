00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:03.500
Mr. Li

2
00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:06.466
You and Miss Huang both drank too much last night

3
00:00:06.566 --> 00:00:08.866
I put you all in your respective rooms

4
00:00:08.866 --> 00:00:10.200
So I left.

5
00:00:10.366 --> 00:00:11.966
I didn't expect the back

6
00:00:12.966 --> 00:00:14.200
Mr. Li, I'm sorry

7
00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:15.166
It's all my fault

8
00:00:15.166 --> 00:00:16.800
If you want to fight or punish me, I will bear it.

9
00:00:17.866 --> 00:00:19.400
That means before you go

10
00:00:19.466 --> 00:00:22.666
I've been in my room the whole time, right?

11
00:00:25.566 --> 00:00:28.600
The surveillance tape broke last night, bro.

12
00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.000
That's no coincidence.

13
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.900
You say it's a lie

14
00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:34.400
Or someone else?

15
00:00:34.466 --> 00:00:36.266
No new clues yet.

16
00:00:37.666 --> 00:00:39.466
It happened too suddenly

17
00:00:40.333 --> 00:00:42.000
I didn't think it through.

18
00:00:42.866 --> 00:00:45.033
This is not necessarily done by the emperor

19
00:00:45.733 --> 00:00:47.300
I warned him.

20
00:00:47.366 --> 00:00:48.866
He's a smart guy.

21
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.866
He doesn't joke about the royal future

22
00:00:52.366 --> 00:00:53.666
That's the Xu family

23
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.566
Now I most want you to break up with the royal family

24
00:00:56.566 --> 00:00:57.633
Only them

25
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.433
Xiaomei, go to work first

26
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.233
It's not your fault.

27
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:03.766
Don't have a psychological burden

28
00:01:04.366 --> 00:01:06.466
I will definitely pay attention to Mr. Li in the future

29
00:01:17.666 --> 00:01:18.466
Shi Zong

30
00:01:19.266 --> 00:01:21.800
You go check out Brother Wang Xuemei

31
00:01:22.066 --> 00:01:23.400
You doubt him?

32
00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.800
I don't believe he did it.

33
00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.566
But he did have a big heart.
