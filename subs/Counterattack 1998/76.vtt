00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:13.200
Sorry Mr. Li

2
00:00:13.933 --> 00:00:14.800
That's okay.

3
00:00:16.266 --> 00:00:17.066
Secretary Wang

4
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:19.366
You didn't rest well yesterday, did you?

5
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.533
Do you want to give you a day off?

6
00:00:21.533 --> 00:00:22.500
No need for Mr. Li

7
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.966
You have a very important party tonight

8
00:00:24.966 --> 00:00:26.300
I'm going to arrange it myself

9
00:00:28.466 --> 00:00:30.366
Your nerves are too tight

10
00:00:30.766 --> 00:00:32.366
It's just dinner.

11
00:00:32.533 --> 00:00:33.900
Details determine success or failure

12
00:00:33.933 --> 00:00:36.033
It was taught by Mr. Li

13
00:00:36.933 --> 00:00:38.266
Yeah.

14
00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:43.866
Divorced brother

15
00:00:43.866 --> 00:00:45.400
Why don't you eat first?

16
00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:46.400
I have something else to do

17
00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:47.900
I'll go first

18
00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:49.000
Mr. Huang, you are busy first.

19
00:00:54.066 --> 00:00:55.966
Mr. Li, I'm going to the bathroom first

20
00:00:55.966 --> 00:00:57.066
You eat first

21
00:00:57.066 --> 00:00:59.666
Can you open another bottle of wine by the way?

22
00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:05.700
Are you drugged?

23
00:01:06.133 --> 00:01:08.300
Better hurry up without you

24
00:01:08.766 --> 00:01:13.600
Or I'll throw your pornographic photos down from the roof

25
00:01:13.933 --> 00:01:15.633
I see.

26
00:01:24.733 --> 00:01:25.700
Wait a minute.

27
00:01:26.466 --> 00:01:27.433
Give it to me.

28
00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:34.633
Mr. Li

29
00:01:35.166 --> 00:01:36.300
Sorry.

30
00:01:44.466 --> 00:01:45.266
