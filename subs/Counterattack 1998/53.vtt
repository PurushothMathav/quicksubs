00:00:02.566 --> 00:00:03.366
brother

2
00:00:06.466 --> 00:00:08.833
Wife, I'll take you back to the place

3
00:00:09.066 --> 00:00:11.200
I want to talk to Stone about something

4
00:00:11.533 --> 00:00:14.100
No need, I'll just go back by myself

5
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:16.133
The doctor said I'm recovering well

6
00:00:16.133 --> 00:00:17.766
And will be discharged soon

7
00:00:17.766 --> 00:00:19.566
Go get busy

8
00:00:20.066 --> 00:00:21.500
Then I don't care about you.

9
00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.300
I'm leaving, be careful

10
00:00:29.566 --> 00:00:33.066
Brother, I have done everything you told me

11
00:00:33.066 --> 00:00:35.866
2 million spent nothing

12
00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:36.766
I am now

13
00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.600
I don't even have 1,000 dollars left.

14
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:40.400
monitor

15
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.000
Didn't they notice?

16
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.566
You find that the person I'm looking for just confronts

17
00:00:46.333 --> 00:00:47.400
That's fine.

18
00:00:47.933 --> 00:00:49.300
The more mines are buried

19
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.266
The louder it will explode

20
00:00:54.066 --> 00:00:56.366
Let's move on.

21
00:00:59.766 --> 00:01:02.166
The Xu family bought the land at a high price

22
00:01:02.666 --> 00:01:04.033
Now the funding chain is broken.

23
00:01:05.133 --> 00:01:06.333
They have decided to

24
00:01:06.333 --> 00:01:08.266
Open an auction of your own antiques

25
00:01:08.566 --> 00:01:10.033
That's such a good thing

26
00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.400
Of course we're going to go over and cheer them up.

27
00:01:14.333 --> 00:01:16.600
Brother, what do you say?

28
00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:25.600
Good idea

29
00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.900
I'll do it now. Go ahead.
