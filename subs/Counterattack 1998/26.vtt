00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.900
Which house do you want to buy?

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.366
The environment is too bad

3
00:00:08.366 --> 00:00:10.700
I'm gonna use the rest of 1.70 million

4
00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:12.300
Buy all the houses here

5
00:00:12.466 --> 00:00:14.200
The more, the better.

6
00:00:14.266 --> 00:00:16.700
Brother, can we stop joking?

7
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.600
My little heart is about to get sick

8
00:00:19.666 --> 00:00:21.600
Just this house. Why did you buy it?

9
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.400
Do I look like I'm joking?

10
00:00:23.933 --> 00:00:25.500
Trust me.

11
00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:26.700
You are like this

12
00:00:27.366 --> 00:00:30.266
You go to someone more prestigious nearby

13
00:00:30.266 --> 00:00:32.100
See how many houses are still available for sale

14
00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.400
Ordinary 800 a square meter

15
00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:36.766
Better?

16
00:00:36.766 --> 00:00:38.033
1,000 a square meter

17
00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:39.433
Remember to sing

18
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:41.866
You are the boss, you have the final say

19
00:00:41.933 --> 00:00:42.966
I'm on it.

20
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:43.833
OK. Go

21
00:00:47.333 --> 00:00:48.133
Li Yi

22
00:00:48.566 --> 00:00:50.366
Why are you here?

23
00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.000
You want me to buy a house here?

24
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.566
I can still meet Miss Huang

25
00:00:53.566 --> 00:00:56.966
I didn't say sorry to you in person for what happened before.

26
00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:58.966
Please remind us

27
00:00:58.966 --> 00:01:00.900
I also called you a liar

28
00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.500
It's okay, it's a normal reaction

29
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.100
Better chance than chance.

30
00:01:06.133 --> 00:01:07.933
My dad said yesterday that he wanted to thank you

31
00:01:07.933 --> 00:01:10.066
Then I'll give you a house as a gift.

32
00:01:10.066 --> 00:01:11.866
Let's go to Tiancheng International Selection

33
00:01:11.866 --> 00:01:13.366
That's a new house that's just been built.

34
00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:14.600
No.

35
00:01:14.766 --> 00:01:16.800
I didn't buy a house here to live

36
00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.100
It's about investing.

37
00:01:19.466 --> 00:01:22.100
Invest in this house

38
00:01:22.933 --> 00:01:25.900
I'm sure you'll lose everything.
