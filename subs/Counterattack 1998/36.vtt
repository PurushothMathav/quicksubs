00:00:02.533 --> 00:00:04.633
You don't want my wife to live?

2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.666
Let me say let you compensate him for killing me

3
00:00:08.666 --> 00:00:10.133
Do you dare to kill me?

4
00:00:10.133 --> 00:00:12.433
You try as you wish

5
00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.400
Brother, I beg you, you can't go

6
00:00:19.933 --> 00:00:20.766
you

7
00:00:21.466 --> 00:00:22.833
You're a fucking coward

8
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.366
I'm going to ask you one last time.

9
00:00:26.966 --> 00:00:29.833
Where is it hahaha

10
00:00:29.966 --> 00:00:31.666
I'll tell you again.

11
00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:33.500
I don't know.

12
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.066
When your wife dies

13
00:00:36.766 --> 00:00:39.566
I'll let you kill a stick of incense on his grave

14
00:00:39.566 --> 00:00:40.366
How did it go?

15
00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.766
It's too cheap to kill you

16
00:00:43.766 --> 00:00:46.533
I'll let you know what it means to be unable to survive

17
00:00:46.533 --> 00:00:48.100
I can't die

18
00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:49.900
Come on, three years old

19
00:01:10.333 --> 00:01:12.033
Sorry wife

20
00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:13.700
All because of me

21
00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.166
I don't blame you for my bad life

22
00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:18.500
benefit

23
00:01:19.733 --> 00:01:21.000
You promise me

24
00:01:21.366 --> 00:01:23.500
After I die, you take good care of the little slave

25
00:01:23.866 --> 00:01:25.833
Don't even think about revenge, okay?

26
00:01:26.133 --> 00:01:26.933
Wife

27
00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:28.666
You won't die.

28
00:01:29.333 --> 00:01:30.766
I have no hope

29
00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.466
Just find another person with a successful bone marrow match

30
00:01:34.866 --> 00:01:38.100
You are saved, wife

31
00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:40.600
You trust me.

32
00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:42.566
Mr. Yu

33
00:01:44.566 --> 00:01:45.700
Excuse me.

34
00:01:45.733 --> 00:01:48.633
There are new patients coming in this routine ward

35
00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:49.833
Your anger

36
00:01:50.166 --> 00:01:51.833
Need to be transferred to the general ward

37
00:01:54.133 --> 00:01:55.200
What do you mean?

38
00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:56.333
My Wife

39
00:01:56.333 --> 00:01:59.000
Why is it an ordinary phone in this situation now?
