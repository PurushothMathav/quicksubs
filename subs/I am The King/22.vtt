00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.633
A toast from a dog man and a woman

2
00:00:01.966 --> 00:00:03.233
I don't drink

3
00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:06.233
Ah, Wang Chang

4
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:08.133
Please forgive me forgive me

5
00:00:08.133 --> 00:00:09.166
Give me a chance.

6
00:00:09.166 --> 00:00:11.400
Give me a chance to forgive me

7
00:00:11.466 --> 00:00:14.200
We have been married for so many years after all

8
00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:14.800
Forgive me.

9
00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:16.700
Give me a chance I won't dare again

10
00:00:20.066 --> 00:00:22.066
I never give people a second chance

11
00:00:22.566 --> 00:00:25.366
The man auctioned the bastard for 500 million

12
00:00:25.366 --> 00:00:27.266
All donated to charitable foundations

13
00:00:27.266 --> 00:00:29.200
Yeah. Hey.

14
00:00:29.466 --> 00:00:30.333
Ah, senior brother

15
00:00:30.333 --> 00:00:31.133
Senior Brother

16
00:00:31.133 --> 00:00:31.900
Brother, I'm disrespectful.

17
00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:33.500
You mustn't take things away

18
00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.333
Please don't walk.

19
00:00:35.333 --> 00:00:38.966
Old man, please raise your hand

20
00:00:39.066 --> 00:00:42.466
All of this is due to the unfilial son of our family

21
00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.066
All this stuff he's done?

22
00:00:45.166 --> 00:00:48.666
Ah, can you give our Wang family a way to live?

23
00:00:48.666 --> 00:00:50.466
Hahaha begging me is useless

24
00:00:50.466 --> 00:00:53.400
Ask for Lord Xiao

25
00:00:53.933 --> 00:00:56.866
Lord He, hahaha, Lord Corpse

26
00:00:56.933 --> 00:00:59.500
Why don't you forgive me?

27
00:01:00.166 --> 00:01:02.333
So why now?

28
00:01:02.333 --> 00:01:03.700
Oops hahaha

29
00:01:04.966 --> 00:01:06.266
This this

30
00:01:07.366 --> 00:01:09.133
How dare you pretend to be a golden lotus monkey?

31
00:01:09.133 --> 00:01:10.466
Do you want to live?
