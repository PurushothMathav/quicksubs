00:00:02.366 --> 00:00:03.166
King's Landing

2
00:00:03.666 --> 00:00:05.066
You are kidding

3
00:00:05.066 --> 00:00:07.333
King's Landing has some things to say

4
00:00:07.333 --> 00:00:08.366
I'm not talking nonsense.

5
00:00:08.366 --> 00:00:10.000
Last night I went to the Skyline Hotel

6
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.933
Not only did he break Chu Yu's legs

7
00:00:11.933 --> 00:00:13.866
He also crippled the four masters of the Chu family

8
00:00:13.866 --> 00:00:14.166
And finally.

9
00:00:14.166 --> 00:00:16.966
People from the top ten families in Shangjing knelt before me and confessed their mistakes

10
00:00:16.966 --> 00:00:17.766
I didn't agree.

11
00:00:17.766 --> 00:00:19.500
I asked them to apologize to the Ye family

12
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.566
You saw Yufei last night

13
00:00:21.566 --> 00:00:22.766
Those who came last night

14
00:00:22.766 --> 00:00:25.566
Everyone who kneels down is beaten by you

15
00:00:25.566 --> 00:00:27.566
No wonder they are so afraid of you

16
00:00:27.566 --> 00:00:30.300
Xiao Jinlian, you made another mistake when you thought about it, right?

17
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.133
It's up to you to beat the four disabled experts of the Chu family alone

18
00:00:33.133 --> 00:00:34.666
He also broke Chu Yu's legs

19
00:00:34.666 --> 00:00:37.166
Do you think anyone believes what you say?

20
00:00:37.466 --> 00:00:39.000
It's Xiao Xiao

21
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.366
Hello face

22
00:00:40.366 --> 00:00:41.400
You don't want to say it

23
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.333
You go to the Chu family to apologize in person

24
00:00:44.333 --> 00:00:46.033
It's something that everybody understands.

25
00:00:46.133 --> 00:00:48.900
But you can't make it look like this.

26
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.066
That's the big talk

27
00:00:51.066 --> 00:00:52.700
Don't talk nonsense

28
00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:55.133
The Chu family finally forgave us

29
00:00:55.133 --> 00:00:56.733
What if the Chu family hears this?

30
00:00:56.733 --> 00:00:58.366
How do we end up?

31
00:01:01.966 --> 00:01:03.300
Grandma has a big problem

32
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.500
What's the matter, I got a message here.

33
00:01:05.533 --> 00:01:07.200
The second lady of the Chu family last night

34
00:01:07.266 --> 00:01:08.166
I had my legs broken.

35
00:01:08.166 --> 00:01:11.100
What are you doing to your feet and heads?
