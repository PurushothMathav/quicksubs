1
00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.200
I said boss

2
00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:02.700
Can't you read?

3
00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:03.500
This contract

4
00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:06.066
My daughter's name is written in black and white

5
00:00:06.066 --> 00:00:07.566
Can't you see?

6
00:00:07.566 --> 00:00:11.033
Ahaha, I'm just confirming, haha, mom.

7
00:00:11.066 --> 00:00:12.600
Our family is saved

8
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.066
Take a look

9
00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.266
With Yufei's contract

10
00:00:21.266 --> 00:00:24.900
The Ye family can finally get out of the crisis hahaha

11
00:00:25.133 --> 00:00:27.200
Before the third child

12
00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:30.366
I said that I will deduct your family's dividends.

13
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.066
Don't take it to heart if you say I'm angry for a while

14
00:00:33.066 --> 00:00:34.300
Yes yes yes mom

15
00:00:34.333 --> 00:00:35.766
Are we all family?

16
00:00:35.766 --> 00:00:37.733
If there are difficulties, we should find a way together.

17
00:00:37.733 --> 00:00:41.000
The family should be more united

18
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.133
Is it Qingqing?

19
00:00:42.133 --> 00:00:43.066
After you?

20
00:00:43.066 --> 00:00:45.466
Make more connections with your sister

21
00:00:45.466 --> 00:00:47.100
Learn more from him

22
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.533
What can I learn from him?

23
00:00:48.533 --> 00:00:49.866
Learn how he sells.

24
00:00:49.866 --> 00:00:50.766
What nonsense are you talking about?

25
00:00:50.766 --> 00:00:52.866
You wake up and be careful I tear your mouth apart

26
00:00:52.866 --> 00:00:55.466
Grandma, why don't you think about it?

27
00:00:55.466 --> 00:00:57.500
A group as big as Rockefeller

28
00:00:57.533 --> 00:00:58.800
How could it be for no reason?

29
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.600
Give our family such a generous contract

30
00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.900
It's a loan. It's upside down.

31
00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:04.466
It's clearly money

32
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:05.366
Think about it.

33
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.566
How can there be such a good thing in this world?

34
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.200
So what do you mean?

35
00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.000
I see.

36
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.966
I'm afraid it's Yufei's sister in the president's office

37
00:01:15.966 --> 00:01:18.500
Paid some shameful price

38
00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:19.733
Ye Xinqi you

39
00:01:19.733 --> 00:01:21.400
What am I?

40
00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.300
I really didn't see my brother-in-law still standing here

41
00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:26.766
Xiao Junlin, I'm really sorry.

42
00:01:26.766 --> 00:01:28.700
What I just said

43
00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:30.566
Hurt your self-esteem

44
00:01:30.566 --> 00:01:32.166
You are outside the office

45
00:01:32.166 --> 00:01:34.900
Listen to Sister Yufei talking business with other men

46
00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:36.866
It should be very sad

47
00:01:36.866 --> 00:01:38.200
Oh, right.

48
00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.133
After all, this is not the first time you have done this kind of thing.

49
00:01:41.133 --> 00:01:42.566
You should be used to it by now

50
00:01:42.566 --> 00:01:45.166
Ye Qingqing, I advise you to shut up
