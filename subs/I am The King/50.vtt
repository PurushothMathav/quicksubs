00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.900
Chairperson, I miss you, miss

2
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.800
Loan amount of 100 billion

3
00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.000
Term 99 years

4
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.766
Yes interest is -5% Mr. Davis

5
00:00:13.766 --> 00:00:14.900
Are you mistaken?

6
00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:16.800
That's right, it's really like this.

7
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.366
You're not just going to lend us money.

8
00:00:18.366 --> 00:00:19.866
You have to pay us interest.

9
00:00:19.866 --> 00:00:21.866
Miss Ye can find our group

10
00:00:21.866 --> 00:00:23.300
It is really an honor for our group.

11
00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.333
The interest we give you is due.

12
00:00:25.333 --> 00:00:27.033
I think this contract is pretty good

13
00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.433
Fly then

14
00:00:34.566 --> 00:00:35.566
Happy cooperation

15
00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:44.400
Mr. Xiao, Miss Ye

16
00:00:44.533 --> 00:00:46.766
Well, it's convenient for us to go and have a meal.

17
00:00:46.766 --> 00:00:47.666
No, nothing else.

18
00:00:47.666 --> 00:00:49.466
The family is still waiting for this contract to rest

19
00:00:49.466 --> 00:00:49.866
Then I, I, I

20
00:00:49.866 --> 00:00:51.100
I'll give you bread.

21
00:00:57.733 --> 00:00:58.666
Thank you, Miss.

22
00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:00.133
Please encounter anything hair in the future.

23
00:01:00.133 --> 00:01:01.166
Contact me at this time.

24
00:01:01.166 --> 00:01:03.600
We at Lehejia welcome you very much.

25
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.166
Okay, that's it.

26
00:01:05.166 --> 00:01:06.900
So how did you guys get here?

27
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.566
We came by taxi. Take a taxi?

28
00:01:08.566 --> 00:01:10.500
Too much trouble, miss

29
00:01:12.266 --> 00:01:14.333
Then ask if there is any other order?

30
00:01:14.333 --> 00:01:15.766
Put away your thoughts later

31
00:01:15.766 --> 00:01:17.200
Do things honestly

32
00:01:17.266 --> 00:01:18.766
Then you're fine.

33
00:01:18.933 --> 00:01:21.966
I'll go first, you guys, go slowly, go

34
00:01:23.933 --> 00:01:24.733
Xiao Junlin

35
00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.566
This Davis changed the contract and delivered the car.

36
00:01:27.733 --> 00:01:29.666
Attitudes change too fast

37
00:01:29.666 --> 00:01:30.633
You be honest

38
00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.300
What's your relationship with him?
