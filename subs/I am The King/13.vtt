1
00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:03.366
This third master, you are crazy

2
00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:06.933
Sister Yue has not killed you several times

3
00:00:06.933 --> 00:00:09.033
Take my dowry and roll down

4
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:10.400
Humph

5
00:00:11.166 --> 00:00:12.200
kid

6
00:00:12.733 --> 00:00:14.433
Are you in good spirits?

7
00:00:14.666 --> 00:00:18.366
I'll see how you end today.

8
00:00:19.066 --> 00:00:23.033
Boy, you can lift my butt

9
00:00:23.966 --> 00:00:25.400
Is dead

10
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:35.100
Wang Chang

11
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.233
There are multiple furniture units here, please come in

12
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:42.000
Yo Xiaojun, you really know how to play?

13
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:46.300
Now the courier is still responsible for receiving the lines when delivering to your door.

14
00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.700
Hahaha blind

15
00:00:48.733 --> 00:00:52.866
Let him drive and let us all take a look at this courier

16
00:00:52.866 --> 00:00:55.166
What style can you pay for?

17
00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:59.900
This is my bride price

18
00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.800
Mountains and rivers are happy

19
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.200
It is the biggest prize at the end of the country's pacification against the Northern Army

20
00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.000
reward

21
00:01:09.266 --> 00:01:10.766
Whoever has this life

22
00:01:10.866 --> 00:01:14.433
You can choose three thousand miles of good fields in the land of Mobei

23
00:01:14.666 --> 00:01:16.366
As a permanent territory

24
00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.500
Mr. Wang, is this true?

25
00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.566
Really really shit?

26
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.000
Manager Xiao

27
00:01:23.333 --> 00:01:25.933
I thought you'd come up with something baby

28
00:01:25.933 --> 00:01:28.033
As a result, I got a broken jade seal

29
00:01:28.366 --> 00:01:32.166
What else do you say that breaking the jade seal can be exchanged for private territory?

30
00:01:32.166 --> 00:01:33.366
I'll tell you what.

31
00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.600
Is it the king of the world?

32
00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.233
What private territory

33
00:01:37.366 --> 00:01:39.933
And you piece of shit

34
00:01:39.933 --> 00:01:42.233
Which stall did you escape from?

35
00:01:42.666 --> 00:01:45.133
It's you who scared me to death.

36
00:01:45.133 --> 00:01:47.300
So it's true? It's true.

37
00:01:48.533 --> 00:01:49.633
rumored

38
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.100
The king once gave me a mountain and river attack by the US military

39
00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.700
That's the gravity of the country

40
00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:56.500
The whole building is only one meter

41
00:01:56.533 --> 00:02:00.233
But this could never be here

42
00:02:01.133 --> 00:02:02.900
I really didn't expect it.

43
00:02:03.766 --> 00:02:07.366
You, a screwdriver, are quite cultured

44
00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.466
It's a pity that it only makes people laugh

45
00:02:13.466 --> 00:02:14.166
That is.

46
00:02:14.166 --> 00:02:16.566
Xiaojun, you said what you forged is not good

47
00:02:16.566 --> 00:02:18.300
You have to fake something like a jade seal

48
00:02:18.333 --> 00:02:19.600
If it gets out

49
00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.700
Do you want my lady to get angry?

50
00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:23.633
Miss Ye

51
00:02:24.066 --> 00:02:26.700
I can ignore other people's gossip

52
00:02:27.666 --> 00:02:28.966
I just want to ask you now

53
00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:30.566
Mountains and rivers are mountains

54
00:02:30.766 --> 00:02:31.866
Jiangshan is hired

55
00:02:32.333 --> 00:02:34.433
Are you satisfied with this gift?

56
00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.800
Miss, don't be deceived by him

57
00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.100
Yufei, don't believe it

58
00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:41.500
He is a liar

59
00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.466
Just hum

60
00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:44.666
Dogs like this

61
00:02:44.666 --> 00:02:46.600
How can she be worthy of Miss Ye?

62
00:02:47.866 --> 00:02:48.666
I would.

63
00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.300
I would like to be your bride
