1
00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.166
Of course you can go to the Chu family.

2
00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:03.700
That's exactly what I mean.

3
00:00:03.733 --> 00:00:06.166
Manager Chu Yu suffered a loss with you last time

4
00:00:06.166 --> 00:00:07.700
Why did you take the initiative to run to him?

5
00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:09.266
Good manager

6
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.966
I didn't expect you to talk big

7
00:00:11.966 --> 00:00:14.266
You have to be responsible at the critical moment.

8
00:00:14.266 --> 00:00:16.700
As long as you can go to the Chu family tonight

9
00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:18.366
Stop them from forming a business alliance

10
00:00:18.366 --> 00:00:20.033
I recognize you as a grandson-in-law

11
00:00:20.266 --> 00:00:24.100
Let you respect our industrialist old lady with dignity

12
00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:25.566
I mean it.

13
00:00:25.566 --> 00:00:27.700
The old man speaks without words

14
00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:29.100
Then I'll make a bet with you too

15
00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:31.600
If you can stop the Chu family from forming a business alliance today

16
00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.633
I'll apologize to you for what happened today.

17
00:00:33.766 --> 00:00:35.333
And call you Brother Xiao

18
00:00:35.333 --> 00:00:37.766
Sure, then you have to do what you say.

19
00:00:37.766 --> 00:00:39.600
This trip tonight

20
00:00:39.766 --> 00:00:41.300
After all, it's a big danger

21
00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:42.733
It will lose adults

22
00:00:42.733 --> 00:00:44.266
So let me go

23
00:00:44.266 --> 00:00:45.866
I'm old anyway

24
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:47.766
Don't go, dad

25
00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:50.600
Don't worry about Wang Feng.

26
00:00:50.666 --> 00:00:53.400
No need, this little thing doesn't bother you.

27
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.200
But the third

28
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.800
If you say you want to go, don't fight anymore.

29
00:00:57.966 --> 00:01:00.600
Little Junlin, since you are going to Ye's house

30
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.866
What gift do you bring, just ask

31
00:01:02.866 --> 00:01:05.200
I can satisfy you, but gifts are unnecessary.

32
00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:06.466
I can be humane.

33
00:01:06.466 --> 00:01:08.166
When are you still trying to be strong?

34
00:01:08.166 --> 00:01:10.933
Since Xiao Junlin said that no agent is required

35
00:01:10.933 --> 00:01:12.366
Let's see.

36
00:01:12.366 --> 00:01:14.566
How did he get the Chu family's forgiveness empty-handed?

37
00:01:14.566 --> 00:01:15.366
All right.

38
00:01:16.166 --> 00:01:17.766
It's getting late.

39
00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.066
Zhiling, hurry up and go

40
00:01:20.066 --> 00:01:23.100
We are here waiting for your good news

41
00:01:29.966 --> 00:01:32.166
Don't worry, prepare some hot water at night

42
00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:36.700
Right

43
00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.366
I suspect they were charitable back then

44
00:01:39.366 --> 00:01:40.166
Mohui

45
00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:45.500
OK
