1
00:00:02.333 --> 00:00:04.466
Get up, Qi Tian

2
00:00:05.366 --> 00:00:06.533
I believe you.

3
00:00:06.533 --> 00:00:09.600
Your Majesty, he was the culprit for 42 years back then

4
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.266
How can you trust him?

5
00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:14.000
The king must not listen to his deceitful words

6
00:00:14.066 --> 00:00:16.166
That order must be false

7
00:00:22.966 --> 00:00:24.033
The generals obey

8
00:00:25.266 --> 00:00:26.366
Go ahead and bow

9
00:00:27.066 --> 00:00:30.866
Farewell to the Emperor of King's Landing, can't you worship?

10
00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:31.966
Emperor

11
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.933
If you say goodbye to this photo today

12
00:00:34.933 --> 00:00:36.866
All the glory of the first half of your life

13
00:00:36.866 --> 00:00:38.366
Will be lost

14
00:00:38.533 --> 00:00:41.966
The world is here with me

15
00:00:42.166 --> 00:00:43.766
The emperor cannot be defeated

16
00:00:43.766 --> 00:00:46.100
This defeat makes you an ordinary person

17
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.866
Your Majesty, you must think carefully

18
00:00:48.866 --> 00:00:50.066
Your defeat

19
00:00:50.366 --> 00:00:51.900
All your fame

20
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:54.700
Wealth and status will disappear

21
00:00:55.133 --> 00:00:57.066
You will lose everything

22
00:00:57.266 --> 00:00:58.900
Who said he would lose everything?

23
00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.800
King's Landing

24
00:01:00.266 --> 00:01:02.166
Even if the whole world abandons you

25
00:01:02.166 --> 00:01:03.433
You still have me

26
00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.833
I will support you for the rest of your life

27
00:01:11.066 --> 00:01:14.166
Yufei, do you really not dislike me?

28
00:01:14.166 --> 00:01:14.966
King's Landing

29
00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:16.700
actually

30
00:01:16.933 --> 00:01:19.300
I think it's nice that you are an ordinary person.

31
00:01:19.733 --> 00:01:21.866
If you really are King's Landing Throat

32
00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.100
Then it will be very stressful for me to get along with you.

33
00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:26.000
OK

34
00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:28.166
Start today.

35
00:01:29.566 --> 00:01:31.033
I took off my armor and went home

36
00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:32.800
Your Majesty, you will

37
00:01:33.566 --> 00:01:34.566
Hugh, I will persuade you again.

38
00:01:34.766 --> 00:01:36.900
Now as Lord of Landing

39
00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.266
Give the last order

40
00:01:38.766 --> 00:01:39.800
Everybody.

41
00:01:40.366 --> 00:01:41.400
bow
