00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:04.400
Yufei is late

2
00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:05.133
Don't wait.

3
00:00:05.133 --> 00:00:05.800
Go to sleep

4
00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:06.900
Listen to mom

5
00:00:08.366 --> 00:00:11.833
Mom, King's Landing hasn't come back yet. I'll wait for him.

6
00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.500
The Chu family is in a hurry today, so many people have a meeting

7
00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:15.766
He had to frown.

8
00:00:15.766 --> 00:00:17.066
I won't come back this time.

9
00:00:17.066 --> 00:00:18.166
Two more to say

10
00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.400
Mom, how can you say that to him?

11
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.200
He also apologized for our Ye family.

12
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:23.733
He risked his life alone

13
00:00:23.733 --> 00:00:25.700
Not only do you not appreciate him, you also say that to him

14
00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:26.933
What did you say?

15
00:00:26.933 --> 00:00:29.200
We didn't beg him to go

16
00:00:32.266 --> 00:00:33.333
I'm back!

17
00:00:33.333 --> 00:00:35.266
Genie, are you okay?

18
00:00:35.266 --> 00:00:36.866
It's okay, elf

19
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:38.466
You really came back

20
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.366
The Chu family has accepted your apology

21
00:00:40.366 --> 00:00:42.066
They are the ones who should apologize

22
00:00:42.066 --> 00:00:43.300
Now the Chamber of Commerce has disbanded

23
00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:45.900
The Ye family is alright, disbanded

24
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:47.533
Xiaojun, what do you mean?

25
00:00:47.533 --> 00:00:49.433
You explain it, mom

26
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.266
The third sister of the resident has been running for a day

27
00:00:51.266 --> 00:00:52.866
Let him have a good rest.

28
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.900
King's Landing, I made you soup in the kitchen

29
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.466
I'm going to heat it up for you and bring it over

30
00:00:56.466 --> 00:00:57.900
Yue Fei thank you

31
00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:59.466
I'll go by myself.

32
00:01:00.266 --> 00:01:01.333
Maybe.

33
00:01:01.333 --> 00:01:03.333
He didn't even enter the door of the Chu family

34
00:01:03.333 --> 00:01:05.366
He ran back in dismay

35
00:01:05.366 --> 00:01:06.233
Mom

36
00:01:06.933 --> 00:01:08.766
Don't say that to him again

37
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.333
Excuse me, is Miss Ye there?

38
00:01:11.333 --> 00:01:13.100
Mr. Wang, Mr. Li

39
00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:14.700
Why are you all here?

40
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.400
Please take a seat, Miss Ye, we dare not sit

41
00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.733
Miss Ye, it's all our fault.

42
00:01:19.733 --> 00:01:21.200
Please forgive us
