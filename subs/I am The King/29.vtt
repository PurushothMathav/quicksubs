00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:00.700
Manager Xiao

2
00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:03.133
You wouldn't buy a mainland product at the supermarket

3
00:00:03.133 --> 00:00:04.466
Come fool the old gentleman

4
00:00:04.466 --> 00:00:07.066
I said, where did this local dog get the money to buy the baby?

5
00:00:07.066 --> 00:00:10.000
So, I bought a porcelain bottle in the supermarket.

6
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.566
Where do you think my Ye family is?

7
00:00:11.566 --> 00:00:13.333
Black me for nothing

8
00:00:13.333 --> 00:00:14.600
I was deceived by you

9
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:17.366
Prepare who you have found to come back

10
00:00:17.566 --> 00:00:19.000
Who said I'd send you?

11
00:00:19.733 --> 00:00:20.533
What do you mean?

12
00:00:20.533 --> 00:00:23.233
Don't you guys smell that?

13
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:28.000
It smells really good.

14
00:00:28.333 --> 00:00:29.666
The aroma of wine

15
00:00:29.733 --> 00:00:31.066
I'm almost drunk

16
00:00:31.066 --> 00:00:32.766
Where did this aroma come from?

17
00:00:32.933 --> 00:00:35.700
Is there wine in this bottle?

18
00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.200
Correct, it turns out that you didn't give a bottle.

19
00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.133
Baijiu in bulk in this bottle?

20
00:00:40.133 --> 00:00:42.800
It turns out that I just gave you the best Dukang today.

21
00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.200
And your wine

22
00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.166
Do you dare to say it?

23
00:00:48.133 --> 00:00:51.800
This is the world-famous dzi wine of Mobei Wangting

24
00:00:52.133 --> 00:00:54.266
There is a divine spring in the royal pavilion of Mobei

25
00:00:54.333 --> 00:00:57.866
According to legend, this divine spring only drips one drop of spring water every month

26
00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:59.266
Because it is too rare

27
00:00:59.266 --> 00:01:01.033
They're called dzi beads.

28
00:01:01.266 --> 00:01:04.933
This wine made from dzi beads is called dzi bead wine

29
00:01:04.933 --> 00:01:07.733
This dzi bead wine is not only rich and sweet

30
00:01:07.733 --> 00:01:10.500
After drinking it, you can make white bones raw meat

31
00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:11.600
Dead trees meet spring

32
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:12.600
Sterilization

33
00:01:13.166 --> 00:01:15.066
This Mobei Heavenly Court is still a group

34
00:01:15.066 --> 00:01:17.066
Boil wine for a day or two and sell it to Daxia

35
00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.400
It can be sold for tens of billions of dollars.

36
00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.166
I brought a total of 2 taels today.

37
00:01:21.166 --> 00:01:22.866
But you left like this

38
00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:23.733
Old Taijun

39
00:01:23.733 --> 00:01:26.200
I saw you sitting there and never getting up

40
00:01:26.266 --> 00:01:28.200
It must be the enemy's legs

41
00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.000
I'm afraid it's hard to stand up now

42
00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.366
I have been disabled in my legs for many years

43
00:01:33.366 --> 00:01:35.400
But how do you know that?

44
00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.300
Then why don't you hurry up and feed the dumplings on the ground?

45
00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:39.100
Get up and lick
