What are you doing, please?

2
00:00:02.333 --> 00:00:04.300
What are you yelling at?

3
00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:05.766
What's the big deal?

4
00:00:05.766 --> 00:00:10.166
I won't talk to Mr. Wang about disgust, will I?

5
00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.466
Talk about business talk about business

6
00:00:12.466 --> 00:00:14.166
Can ride on you to talk business

7
00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:17.000

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.966

This money

12
00:00:28.666 --> 00:00:31.433
Enough for you to get three months' salary in the factory

13
00:00:31.466 --> 00:00:32.466
Are you now?

14
00:00:32.666 --> 00:00:34.800
Hurry up and wait for me for half an hour.

15
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.000

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.266
What's going on, this bitch?

19
00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.333
Then I was out walking my dog with other men

20
00:00:44.333 --> 00:00:45.900
Hey, what are you talking about, bitch?

21
00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.000
Tell you this is my baby girl

22
00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.600
What's wrong with you not coming home after working part-time for many years?

23
00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.033
Go crazy when you come back

24
00:00:54.166 --> 00:00:55.766
Hmph you're not at home

25
00:00:55.766 --> 00:00:58.533
I can't let my daughter find another good man

26
00:00:58.533 --> 00:01:00.400
Could it be that I will hang myself on you poor ghost?

27
00:01:00.466 --> 00:01:01.900
Although I said I haven't come back for three years

28
00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:03.300
But when will Shen Jiajia ask for money?

29
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.366
I didn't call him.

30
00:01:04.366 --> 00:01:06.266
What's wrong with your stupid face?

31
00:01:06.766 --> 00:01:09.700
Is it enough, Mr. Wang?

32
00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.166
Buy any bag.

33
00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.566
That's enough for you to work outside for three years

34
00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.766
I tell you brat

35
00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.466
I can't keep your beautiful wife

36
00:01:18.566 --> 00:01:23.400
Just be honest and be your green-haired turtle

37
00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.633
Good man and woman, I will kill you.

38
00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.433
Hahaha

39
00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.000
