00:00:02.933 --> 00:00:03.733
Miss Ye

2
00:00:03.966 --> 00:00:06.300
I really don't need to give any military leader a red flag inspection

3
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:07.533
How can that work?

4
00:00:07.533 --> 00:00:09.366
How could you miss this opportunity?

5
00:00:09.366 --> 00:00:10.766
As long as you catch up with the military and civilian action

6
00:00:10.766 --> 00:00:11.966
You won't come once as a monk

7
00:00:12.066 --> 00:00:14.166
Come on, I'll take you in

8
00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:23.733
This is your miss

9
00:00:23.733 --> 00:00:24.666
So beautiful

10
00:00:24.666 --> 00:00:27.700
It's you guys who dress so casually

11
00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:30.000
Really flowers on cow dung

12
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:32.800
Why are you here?

13
00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:34.200
how

14
00:00:35.133 --> 00:00:37.600
Are you allowed to toast Jun Yihou alone?

15
00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.166
My lady can't come

16
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.400
Your king, don't be angry with such a person!

17
00:00:43.566 --> 00:00:46.866
We'll smash them with money later.

18
00:00:47.533 --> 00:00:48.333
Let's go

19
00:00:49.133 --> 00:00:51.900
Hahaha friends be quiet

20
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.366
Everyone be quiet

21
00:00:53.366 --> 00:00:57.200
Ladies and gentlemen, we are all able to gather here today

22
00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.233
All for a common purpose

23
00:00:59.566 --> 00:01:01.166
That is to be able to see

24
00:01:01.166 --> 00:01:04.800
The world-famous military commander Lord's demeanor

25
00:01:04.933 --> 00:01:06.100
Everybody knows that.

26
00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:07.933
What about the hometown of Lord Marshal Hou?

27
00:01:07.933 --> 00:01:09.600
Right in our Lanzhou

28
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.166
And this time back home

29
00:01:11.166 --> 00:01:14.766
That was at the strong invitation of the World Chief

30
00:01:14.766 --> 00:01:16.366
Did the lord agree after the military order?

31
00:01:16.366 --> 00:01:19.566
I'm going to give you a meet and greet.

32
00:01:19.566 --> 00:01:20.800
My lord

33
00:01:20.966 --> 00:01:22.500
Just relying on this kind of nameless

34
00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:23.533
So today?

35
00:01:23.533 --> 00:01:26.700
I won it for everyone and Lord Junlie

36
00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.066
Opportunities for group photos and toasts

37
00:01:29.066 --> 00:01:32.666
However, Lord Junlie, things are not perfect

38
00:01:32.733 --> 00:01:34.933
A chance for a group photo and a toast today?

39
00:01:34.933 --> 00:01:36.666
Only once each

40
00:01:36.666 --> 00:01:38.066
For the sake of fairness

41
00:01:38.066 --> 00:01:39.366
These two activities

42
00:01:39.366 --> 00:01:43.066
We decided to decide the candidates by auction

43
00:01:43.066 --> 00:01:44.666
Now I declare

44
00:01:44.866 --> 00:01:48.166
Auction opportunity to take a photo with Lord King's Landing

45
00:01:48.166 --> 00:01:50.333
Starting price 1 million

46
00:01:50.333 --> 00:01:52.100
Can I take a photo with the Lord's Landing

47
00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:53.533
Isn't it possible to blow for a lifetime?

48
00:01:53.533 --> 00:01:54.400
More than just blowing for a lifetime

49
00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.000
It's simply glorious

50
00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.300
2 million

51
00:01:58.066 --> 00:01:59.800
3 million 5 million

52
00:02:00.466 --> 00:02:02.666
I give 10 million

53
00:02:02.733 --> 00:02:04.700
10 million, 20 million.
