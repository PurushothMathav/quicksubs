00:00:01.333 --> 00:00:03.166
Will you die?

2
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.033
Is he dead?

3
00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:09.300
Xiao Liu

4
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.600
I'm still alive

5
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:13.366
Fortunately you didn't die

6
00:00:13.666 --> 00:00:15.833
Otherwise we're in trouble

7
00:00:16.966 --> 00:00:19.866
Your troubles are just beginning

8
00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:21.666
Look at you stinky dog

9
00:00:22.266 --> 00:00:23.966
My brain was blown away

10
00:00:23.966 --> 00:00:25.766
Must be some nonsense

11
00:00:25.766 --> 00:00:28.600
Make the divorce agreement better within three days

12
00:00:28.933 --> 00:00:29.733
otherwise

13
00:00:31.066 --> 00:00:33.300
A fee for sweeping out the house

14
00:00:38.166 --> 00:00:40.766
Hey, you don't have this stinky tofu in our family.

15
00:00:40.766 --> 00:00:42.233
Sooner or later I will starve to death outside

16
00:00:42.866 --> 00:00:44.600
King, take it easy

17
00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.966
I also informed my army that 100,000 soldiers came to America

18
00:00:46.966 --> 00:00:49.566
You will definitely recover your memory when you see them.

19
00:00:50.933 --> 00:00:53.000
Call 100,000 soldiers to America

20
00:00:53.066 --> 00:00:54.166
Aren't you afraid of disturbing the people?

21
00:00:54.166 --> 00:00:56.700
Your Majesty, you have recovered

22
00:00:58.166 --> 00:00:59.266
How is Beijing now?

23
00:00:59.266 --> 00:01:00.700
Since you cut off Wang Qin

24
00:01:00.933 --> 00:01:02.800
The royal court of Beijing has completely disintegrated

25
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.933
Now life is a mess

26
00:01:04.933 --> 00:01:06.366
No chance of turning over

27
00:01:06.366 --> 00:01:09.133
That's fine, just what?

28
00:01:09.133 --> 00:01:11.066
It's just that after the ceremony was closed that day

29
00:01:11.333 --> 00:01:13.833
Your killer will always be found

30
00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:17.466
In addition, I wish you a fourth wedding and your Princess Ye.

31
00:01:17.566 --> 00:01:19.166
Waited for 03 years

32
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.433
Three years.

33
00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.466
He never lifted the veil.

34
00:01:22.766 --> 00:01:25.033
Why did he say his hijab?

35
00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:26.966
The world only has King's Landing

36
00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.000
I didn't fall into that

37
00:01:29.866 --> 00:01:31.433
I failed him.

38
00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.700
Don't worry, keep bringing people.

39
00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.766
Investigate the capture of the black hand at that year's celebration

40
00:01:36.066 --> 00:01:38.000
What about Princess Ye?

41
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.466
Invite him to the Northern Zhou Dynasty

42
00:01:39.466 --> 00:01:42.200
After three years, I still owe him an explanation
