00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:00.966
you

2
00:00:01.333 --> 00:00:02.966
I'm worried that there is no invitation letter

3
00:00:02.966 --> 00:00:06.166
This Chu Yunzhou will send the invitation letter to his home

4
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.266
Never seen

5
00:00:08.333 --> 00:00:10.500
What about people who are more active in death than eating?

6
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.500
Hey, what do I think?

7
00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.466
Brother Junning, do you dare to act?

8
00:00:14.466 --> 00:00:17.700
Ye Xuan, where are you turning your elbow? Shut up

9
00:00:20.066 --> 00:00:21.600
Miss, since you want to go

10
00:00:21.666 --> 00:00:23.000
Then let him go

11
00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:28.400
Other than Ye Yufei's family

12
00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:30.633
Follow me and start the exam

13
00:00:31.166 --> 00:00:33.466
Go to Nandu for refuge

14
00:00:33.666 --> 00:00:35.333
Hey, why?

15
00:00:35.333 --> 00:00:38.000
Why did the old man treat our family?

16
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.133
Our Ye family has been killed by you

17
00:00:40.133 --> 00:00:41.800
You still have the face to follow

18
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:43.966
Last Prayer

19
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.700
Tomorrow, the Chu family will beat the elf to death

20
00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.700
Finally quell the anger of the enemy

21
00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.866
Drive you out of Ye's house

22
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.433
Forever separate from you

23
00:00:57.166 --> 00:00:58.866
Xiao Junlin is all you

24
00:00:58.866 --> 00:01:00.266
Look at what you've done

25
00:01:00.266 --> 00:01:03.100
Now our family is going to be kicked out of the industrialist

26
00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.000
Mom, stop talking

27
00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.733
I will accompany King's Landing to the appearance ceremony tomorrow

28
00:01:07.733 --> 00:01:10.666
Silly daughter, what are you doing, stupid?

29
00:01:10.766 --> 00:01:12.966
I also go to my dignified night house

30
00:01:12.966 --> 00:01:15.266
We can't let everyone in Beijing see our jokes

31
00:01:15.266 --> 00:01:17.233
No one dares to stand up

32
00:01:17.266 --> 00:01:20.266
Dad, you stay at home and take good care of my mom

33
00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:21.166
You don't have to go.

34
00:01:21.166 --> 00:01:24.066
Then what if someone bullies you tomorrow?

35
00:01:24.066 --> 00:01:26.233
Yes, King's Landing will protect me

36
00:01:26.266 --> 00:01:27.366
I believe him.

37
00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.400
Ye Bofeng, stay at home with peace of mind

38
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.333
I promise you.

39
00:01:30.333 --> 00:01:33.233
It must be safe to send Yufei back

40
00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:34.200
Barracks

41
00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.300
I will entrust my daughter to you

42
00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:37.400
Wait for you to come back

43
00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.900
I will officiate the wedding for you myself

44
00:01:40.166 --> 00:01:41.733
It's really touching

45
00:01:41.733 --> 00:01:43.766
I'm about to cry

46
00:01:43.766 --> 00:01:45.800
The stars don't care about them

47
00:01:45.966 --> 00:01:48.100
Let's hurry to the old lady

48
00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:57.800
Yue Fei

49
00:01:57.933 --> 00:02:00.100
Why did you want to stand by my side just now?

50
00:02:00.166 --> 00:02:02.533
Because every time you talk big

51
00:02:02.533 --> 00:02:04.166
Finally become a reality

52
00:02:04.566 --> 00:02:07.200
So this time I trust you unconditionally

53
00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.566
Must be able to move to a monk

54
00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:11.300
When you're done with this

55
00:02:11.466 --> 00:02:13.700
I'll give myself to you tomorrow night

56
00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:14.900
You're not afraid of your mother?

57
00:02:14.933 --> 00:02:15.766
We quietly
