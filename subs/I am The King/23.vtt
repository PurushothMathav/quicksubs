00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:00.800
I caught a cold

2
00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:03.300
Is my face dying?

3
00:00:08.266 --> 00:00:09.133
Who is that?

4
00:00:09.133 --> 00:00:11.833
It's been so long to make King's Landing throat

5
00:00:11.933 --> 00:00:13.433
Who the hell is he?

6
00:00:14.933 --> 00:00:17.300
So let me introduce myself.

7
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:18.566
My name is Ye Qingqing

8
00:00:18.666 --> 00:00:20.800
It's the eldest lady of Shangjing Ye's family

9
00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.366
She is also Yufei's sister

10
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:25.266
Miss Ye is here

11
00:00:25.266 --> 00:00:27.666
The Ye family is one of the top three families in Beijing

12
00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:28.733
Why is he here?

13
00:00:28.733 --> 00:00:30.100
Come to Nanzhou today

14
00:00:30.333 --> 00:00:32.000
It was entrusted by the family

15
00:00:32.333 --> 00:00:33.566
To congratulate my sister

16
00:00:33.566 --> 00:00:36.333
Bless him for finally finding the blogger to marry

17
00:00:36.333 --> 00:00:37.266
But

18
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.933
I just heard from outside that this guy is daring

19
00:00:40.933 --> 00:00:43.033
How dare you pretend to be Lord King's Landing?

20
00:00:43.166 --> 00:00:44.500
Don't you know?

21
00:00:44.533 --> 00:00:46.533
Has Lord King's Landing been dead for three years?

22
00:00:46.533 --> 00:00:50.066
What? Is Lord's Landing dead?

23
00:00:50.066 --> 00:00:51.400
So you are impersonating

24
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.966
Exactly three years ago.

25
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.700
The Marquis of King's Landing returns from the Northern Expedition

26
00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.466
After the kingmaker performed the canonization ceremony for him

27
00:00:58.466 --> 00:00:59.900
Was assassinated

28
00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:01.233
Died on the spot

29
00:01:01.266 --> 00:01:03.066
In order to stabilize the military heart

30
00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.033
Suppress those Xiao Xiao in Beijing

31
00:01:05.133 --> 00:01:06.566
Ultimately destroy Huagang

32
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.566
It's been three years.

33
00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.866
Wasn't I deceived by him?

34
00:01:12.266 --> 00:01:13.066
Qiu Junlin

35
00:01:13.066 --> 00:01:15.900
Do you know what it is to impersonate a hero?

36
00:01:19.066 --> 00:01:21.800
Miss Ye, the patriarch is both a secret and a vicissitudes of life

37
00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.300
How did you know that the Lord of King's Landing was dead?

38
00:01:24.366 --> 00:01:27.566
Could it be that the Marquis of King's Landing died the same as you two?
