00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.366
Could it be that the death of the Marquis of Junlin is related to your Ye family?

2
00:00:03.733 --> 00:00:07.033
Xiao Jielin, it's okay if you pretend to be the Marquis of Junlin

3
00:00:07.066 --> 00:00:08.600
How dare you forget my Ye family?

4
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:10.300
Do you not want to live?

5
00:00:10.866 --> 00:00:11.800
Miss Ye

6
00:00:12.133 --> 00:00:14.633
It's him. How dare he pretend to be King's Landing Roar?

7
00:00:14.733 --> 00:00:15.566
Miss Ye

8
00:00:15.666 --> 00:00:16.900
Hurry up and clean him up for me

9
00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.500
That's right, Miss Ye is making the decision for us?

10
00:00:20.533 --> 00:00:21.566
Where did the local dog come from?

11
00:00:21.566 --> 00:00:22.633
Go away

12
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.100
Elf, you're talking about me here

13
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:27.200
What crime

14
00:00:27.666 --> 00:00:28.633
You are enough

15
00:00:29.733 --> 00:00:31.566
Xiao Junlin was born in Zheng Meijun

16
00:00:31.766 --> 00:00:33.766
The Lord of King's Landing has always been his idol

17
00:00:33.933 --> 00:00:36.233
He had just set his heart on imitating the Lord's Landing

18
00:00:36.533 --> 00:00:37.666
Am I right?

19
00:00:37.766 --> 00:00:38.566
King's Landing

20
00:00:39.066 --> 00:00:39.866
Ye Yufei

21
00:00:39.933 --> 00:00:41.666
Is it him imitating Xiao Junlin now?

22
00:00:41.666 --> 00:00:43.500
Now it's his forgetting about my Ye family

23
00:00:43.733 --> 00:00:46.000
Grandma Kui is still a thousand miles away, let me congratulate you

24
00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.366
IF

25
00:00:46.366 --> 00:00:48.000
Let grandma know that Xiao Junlin is such a person

26
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.300
He must not be pissed off.

27
00:00:49.333 --> 00:00:51.666
Yufei will celebrate grandma's 80th birthday the day after tomorrow.

28
00:00:51.666 --> 00:00:52.600
You can't go back

29
00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.800
Miss grandma treated you best since childhood

30
00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.233
You must go back, but

31
00:01:01.466 --> 00:01:03.800
Junning, do you dare to go back with me to see grandma?

32
00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:04.900
What am I afraid of?

33
00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:06.400
He is the eldest man of the Ye family

34
00:01:06.533 --> 00:01:07.400
Exactly three years ago

35
00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.600
I have to ask him something.

36
00:01:10.266 --> 00:01:11.333
Then my grandmother is fierce

37
00:01:11.333 --> 00:01:14.100
What should I do?

38
00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.166
Are you crazy?

39
00:01:15.166 --> 00:01:16.500
Such a shameful thing

40
00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:17.600
You have to take her back

41
00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.200
You're not afraid of making jokes

42
00:01:19.666 --> 00:01:20.966
King's Landing, promise me

43
00:01:20.966 --> 00:01:22.166
When you see the family

44
00:01:22.166 --> 00:01:22.900
Be polite.

45
00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:24.666
Ok ok

46
00:01:24.866 --> 00:01:27.066
You go back first, I have to make a call

47
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.266
Who wants to go with you?

48
00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.200
What should Miss Ye and Wang Bayi do?

49
00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:42.233
Continue what I just asked you to do
