00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:01.300
It's all over

2
00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:02.000
Enemy

3
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:02.966
Oh, right.

4
00:00:02.966 --> 00:00:05.233
It's getting late, hurry in, okay?

5
00:00:05.266 --> 00:00:06.800
Then you wait for me here and don't run around

6
00:00:16.266 --> 00:00:18.033
Hello Mr. Davis

7
00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:19.966
I'm Ye Yufei from the Ye family

8
00:00:19.966 --> 00:00:22.666
Miss Ye is here

9
00:00:24.133 --> 00:00:25.800
Please sit please sit please sit

10
00:00:30.666 --> 00:00:32.700
This is the advertisement I prepared for you.

11
00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.366
You can take a look. Okay.

12
00:00:41.733 --> 00:00:43.600
There is no problem with the manual control.

13
00:00:43.966 --> 00:00:45.900
It's a little too rich.

14
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:47.366
It's okay, you can do more.

15
00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:49.066
Mr. Davis

16
00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:50.400
What do you mean?

17
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.766
Can provide 50 billion funds for our Ye family

18
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.100
And don't want a penny of interest?

19
00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:56.566
Yes, that's right.

20
00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.266
I'll sign it, then.

21
00:01:01.133 --> 00:01:04.000
Miss Ye, I tell you that I have one condition

22
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.166
You have to listen to me

23
00:01:05.166 --> 00:01:07.566
I heard about your night market group

24
00:01:07.566 --> 00:01:09.800
A piece of software was developed in advance

25
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.666
The data of the software is stocked with tens of millions of people's

26
00:01:13.733 --> 00:01:14.800
personal data

27
00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.966
The information in the database may be embarrassing

28
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.300
That belongs to the customer's privacy

29
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:20.866
We industrialists can't sell it to you.

30
00:01:20.866 --> 00:01:23.366
Hahahaha!

31
00:01:23.733 --> 00:01:25.133
Miss Ye haha

32
00:01:25.133 --> 00:01:28.600
Don't say the way is so absolute?

33
00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.766
As long as you help me send the information offline.

34
00:01:32.766 --> 00:01:36.266
I'll add the loan limit to your 80 billion sorry

35
00:01:37.566 --> 00:01:39.566
This kind of thing that sells customers once

36
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:41.966
I don't do it
