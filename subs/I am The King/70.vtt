00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:00.700
So I told you.

2
00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:02.733
How could Xiao Junlin be forgiven by the Chu family?

3
00:00:02.733 --> 00:00:04.366
It turned out that he relied on brute force

4
00:00:04.366 --> 00:00:05.700
Beat people up like that

5
00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.300
It's over, it's over, it's over

6
00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:08.966
This time the innocence is going to collapse

7
00:00:08.966 --> 00:00:09.800
Xiao Junlin

8
00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:12.466
What good did you do when you went out last night?

9
00:00:12.466 --> 00:00:14.833
Oops King's Landing

10
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.100
Don't be so impatient

11
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.266
How are we going to end this?

12
00:00:20.266 --> 00:00:21.666
I rely on my brother-in-law

13
00:00:21.666 --> 00:00:23.133
You are too cruel

14
00:00:23.133 --> 00:00:25.166
King's Landing, you're too impulsive

15
00:00:25.733 --> 00:00:27.500
I am a century-old industrialist

16
00:00:28.066 --> 00:00:30.966
It was destroyed by an outsider

17
00:00:32.366 --> 00:00:35.100
Xiao Junlin, you have caused such a catastrophe

18
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.400
What do you say?

19
00:00:36.666 --> 00:00:37.766
Not much to do

20
00:00:37.766 --> 00:00:38.800
Not much to do

21
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.166
What do you mean?

22
00:00:40.366 --> 00:00:42.700
Are you going to make my Ye family a big family?

23
00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:44.100
Accompany you to die?

24
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.100
I think he's a lunatic

25
00:00:46.566 --> 00:00:47.500
All right.

26
00:00:48.266 --> 00:00:49.433
Don't say another word.

27
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:51.600
Pack up quickly

28
00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.100
Get ready to move

29
00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.500
Moving grandma

30
00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:55.733
Where are we going?

31
00:00:55.733 --> 00:00:57.200
I am the ancestor of the Ye family

32
00:00:57.366 --> 00:00:59.366
I once considered that the Ye family would one day

33
00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:00.600
There will be extinction.

34
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.100
He left a house in Nandu

35
00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:04.433
This house

36
00:01:05.066 --> 00:01:06.066
hidden location

37
00:01:06.366 --> 00:01:07.966
It's our Ye family

38
00:01:07.966 --> 00:01:09.900
The last place to go to save your life

39
00:01:10.266 --> 00:01:12.400
Before you find out

40
00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:13.666
Just go.

41
00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:14.600
grandma

42
00:01:14.933 --> 00:01:16.800
Are you running away?

43
00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.000
The Ye family is going to end

44
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.166
What is it if you don't run?

45
00:01:19.166 --> 00:01:20.800
But our whole family

46
00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.133
There's so much more.

47
00:01:22.133 --> 00:01:23.533
How do we go?

48
00:01:23.533 --> 00:01:25.600
You have the nerve to say family

49
00:01:25.733 --> 00:01:28.000
It's all because of your family's disaster

50
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.333
Are you still laughing there?

51
00:01:29.333 --> 00:01:32.100
Little Junni, our Ye family is about to face disaster

52
00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.433
What are you laughing about?

53
00:01:33.466 --> 00:01:34.366
I laugh.

54
00:01:35.266 --> 00:01:36.700
The Ye family is a group of soft

55
00:01:36.966 --> 00:01:38.333
I don't understand.

56
00:01:38.333 --> 00:01:40.000
It is also a first-class family in Shangjing

57
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.266
Why did your Ye family build the Chu family?

58
00:01:42.333 --> 00:01:44.766
It's worse than a rat building a cat
