1
00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:03.400
I have never betrayed you, my lord

2
00:00:05.133 --> 00:00:06.466
Don't call me king

3
00:00:07.166 --> 00:00:08.100
You don't deserve it.

4
00:00:08.666 --> 00:00:10.966
Back then, you were just Zhenbei Army

5
00:00:11.166 --> 00:00:12.600
A humble tiger

6
00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:13.866
I miss you

7
00:00:13.866 --> 00:00:16.033
Promote you and give you a chance

8
00:00:16.166 --> 00:00:18.266
Let you make it all the way to the deputy commander

9
00:00:19.066 --> 00:00:20.166
Under one person

10
00:00:20.366 --> 00:00:21.500
Over 10,000 people

11
00:00:21.533 --> 00:00:23.366
But how did you repay me?

12
00:00:24.066 --> 00:00:26.900
Ambush me on the day of my canonization

13
00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:29.933
Assassinate me and jump away all the guards around me

14
00:00:29.933 --> 00:00:31.366
Want to kill me

15
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.066
And in these three years

16
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.400
You bragged backwards that I was dead

17
00:00:35.533 --> 00:00:37.966
Trying to make the Lord's Landing history

18
00:00:37.966 --> 00:00:39.766
If that's not betrayal

19
00:00:39.766 --> 00:00:41.866
Then what do you call betrayal?

20
00:00:42.066 --> 00:00:42.866
What!

21
00:00:43.166 --> 00:00:46.300
The murderer who assassinated Wang Sheng turned out to be Qi Tian

22
00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.666
Dare to commit such a dirty thing

23
00:00:49.666 --> 00:00:51.566
The king will cross the line

24
00:00:51.566 --> 00:00:53.866
I implore the first king of traitors

25
00:00:54.333 --> 00:00:55.100
Last General Amber

26
00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.100
I implore the first rebel king, the last general, Shenwu

27
00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.333
I implore the first rebel king to chase the dragon

28
00:01:01.333 --> 00:01:03.666
I implore the first traitor Qi Tian

29
00:01:04.266 --> 00:01:06.833
Passion, injustice, everyone gets the theme

30
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.333
What else do you want to say now?

31
00:01:09.333 --> 00:01:10.600
Emperor

32
00:01:11.266 --> 00:01:13.033
I have never betrayed

33
00:01:16.366 --> 00:01:17.700
Look at this.

34
00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.800
Then you understand
