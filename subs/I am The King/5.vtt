00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.400
Shen Jiajia, why haven't you come yet?

2
00:00:04.566 --> 00:00:07.833
Yo, isn't this Xiao Junlin?

3
00:00:07.966 --> 00:00:10.633
Why did you divorce me?

4
00:00:10.766 --> 00:00:13.766
Also booked such a high-end western restaurant

5
00:00:13.866 --> 00:00:16.366
It cost you a few months' salary

6
00:00:16.366 --> 00:00:18.166
It has nothing to do with you where I decide.

7
00:00:18.166 --> 00:00:19.700
Did you bring the divorce agreement?

8
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:24.100
Don't worry, I'm more anxious than you.

9
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.933
A piece of paper wants to take half of my property

10
00:00:33.933 --> 00:00:36.933
Why did I wait for you for three years?

11
00:00:36.933 --> 00:00:39.366
Is it wrong to share the youth compensation fee?

12
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.300
Wait for me for three years

13
00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.233
I don't think you've been happy at all these three years

14
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.933
Hahaha, of course.

15
00:00:47.933 --> 00:00:49.266
These three years

16
00:00:49.266 --> 00:00:52.466
I took good care of Jiajia for you

17
00:00:52.466 --> 00:00:55.700
Hahaha, oops, Mr. Wang

18
00:00:57.466 --> 00:00:59.000
I can sign the divorce agreement

19
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.166
It's just that half of my fortune is worth trillions

20
00:01:01.166 --> 00:01:03.466
I signed it, you really dare to take it

21
00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.366
Xiao Junlin, your brain is broken, right?

22
00:01:06.366 --> 00:01:09.400
You don't screw in the factory

23
00:01:09.533 --> 00:01:12.566
Earned hundreds of billions

24
00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:14.700
Hahaha bargaining

25
00:01:15.333 --> 00:01:17.600
Don't believe his nonsense

26
00:01:17.933 --> 00:01:20.466
Hurry up and sign this divorce agreement

27
00:01:20.466 --> 00:01:21.700
Never mind that he lied.

28
00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:22.933
They left

29
00:01:22.933 --> 00:01:26.166
I'll buy you fritters later.

30
00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:28.633
Thank you Mr. Wang

31
00:01:29.066 --> 00:01:30.066
Xiao Junlin?

32
00:01:30.066 --> 00:01:31.433
Did you see it?

33
00:01:31.466 --> 00:01:33.366
Look at Mr. Wang

34
00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.166
Look at you first

35
00:01:35.166 --> 00:01:37.000
That's called the gap.

36
00:01:37.133 --> 00:01:39.866
Divorce, pay a break

37
00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.433
That's all

38
00:01:42.733 --> 00:01:44.366
Your savings?

39
00:01:44.366 --> 00:01:46.800
I really don't like it

40
00:01:47.766 --> 00:01:50.666
Money, I don't want a penny

41
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.866
Ok I can trust

42
00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.500
But don't regret it.

43
00:02:02.333 --> 00:02:04.033
I have signed the divorce agreement

44
00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.800
From now on, you and I will have nothing to do

45
00:02:05.933 --> 00:02:08.600
Go away, then what are you sitting here waiting for?

46
00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:11.700
Shouldn't you want to drink alone?

47
00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.766
Cry all day because of my divorce

48
00:02:16.466 --> 00:02:17.766
I'm just waiting here.

49
00:02:17.866 --> 00:02:21.700
Waiting for you, a stinky migrant worker, what are you waiting for?

50
00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:25.066
Oh, can't it be waiting for your group of workers?

51
00:02:25.066 --> 00:02:27.466
Hahaha, let me tell you!

52
00:02:27.466 --> 00:02:28.366
This place

53
00:02:28.366 --> 00:02:31.866
I'm not happy for you and your bunch of mud legs to drink here

54
00:02:31.866 --> 00:02:34.000
Bragging miss hahaha

55
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.300
Here it is.
