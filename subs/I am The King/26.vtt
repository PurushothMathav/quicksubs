00:00:01.133 --> 00:00:03.900
Kindly remind you that you don't appreciate it yet

2
00:00:04.566 --> 00:00:06.300
Miss, you are finally here.

3
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:07.700
What about your brother Chu Yunzhou?

4
00:00:07.766 --> 00:00:08.800
Then I have something to do today.

5
00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:11.166
Specially sent me to attend the old maharaja's birthday banquet

6
00:00:12.466 --> 00:00:13.466
That guy?

7
00:00:13.533 --> 00:00:16.500
Is it the husband Ye Yufei has been waiting for for 3 years?

8
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.033
Yeah, that's him.

9
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.233
A light that has never seen the world

10
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.200
How could the truth and Yue Fei like so much?

11
00:00:24.266 --> 00:00:26.100
Come on. Let's go in

12
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:31.666
From humble beginnings

13
00:00:31.733 --> 00:00:33.900
Be sure to keep a low profile when you go in later.

14
00:00:33.933 --> 00:00:36.233
People in our family talk badly

15
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.066
Don't worry, I won't.

16
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.566
This is the gift I prepared for you.

17
00:00:39.566 --> 00:00:40.833
Your first visit

18
00:00:41.066 --> 00:00:42.266
I'll give him to grandma later

19
00:00:42.266 --> 00:00:43.966
Yufei, I brought a gift

20
00:00:43.966 --> 00:00:45.966
How did you get that gift?

21
00:00:45.966 --> 00:00:46.966
Here you go.

22
00:00:48.533 --> 00:00:49.600
Let's go

23
00:00:51.066 --> 00:00:54.000
I wish the foreigners all the best.

24
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.600
Shoubinan Mountain

25
00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.400
Hahaha, okay, okay.

26
00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.800
All sit down, sit down, hahaha

27
00:01:01.066 --> 00:01:03.033
Grandma, I'm back.

28
00:01:04.333 --> 00:01:05.133
sit

29
00:01:05.866 --> 00:01:09.600
Hey, that's where 1 billion people sit

30
00:01:11.966 --> 00:01:12.766
Hey

31
00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.000
That's where billions of people sit.

32
00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:17.700
You can't sit here. You can't sit there.

33
00:01:17.866 --> 00:01:18.966
Where do we sit?

34
00:01:19.133 --> 00:01:22.666
Someone like Brother-in-law Xiang who earns 3,000 a month in the factory?

35
00:01:22.666 --> 00:01:25.133
I'm afraid I can only do it at the door.

36
00:01:25.133 --> 00:01:26.966
Why is your Ye family's birthday banquet?

37
00:01:26.966 --> 00:01:28.700
Is it calculated according to the value?

38
00:01:28.866 --> 00:01:29.533
Of course.

39
00:01:29.533 --> 00:01:30.866
The more expensive

40
00:01:30.866 --> 00:01:33.066
You can sit close to the old lady LaCrosse

41
00:01:33.166 --> 00:01:34.333
Like this location

42
00:01:34.333 --> 00:01:36.466
That's where the billionaires are.

43
00:01:36.466 --> 00:01:38.400
That's worth just in case like me

44
00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.800
Can you sit on the head of the old gentleman?
