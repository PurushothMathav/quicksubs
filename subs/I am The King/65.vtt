00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:01.500
Lord Chen Kunxiao

2
00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:03.000
I just heard it all

3
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.500
The three of them are so respectful to you

4
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.333
Tell me who you are

5
00:00:06.333 --> 00:00:08.866
Yufei, you will be because of my status

6
00:00:08.866 --> 00:00:10.400
And does choice treat me differently?

7
00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.066
No, I will be like every couple when they get married

8
00:00:13.066 --> 00:00:14.366
Like an oath

9
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.833
Rich or poor

10
00:00:16.933 --> 00:00:18.433
All the same to you

11
00:00:18.666 --> 00:00:21.300
Yue Fei's words are enough for you

12
00:00:21.366 --> 00:00:22.666
I, Xiao Jun, you

13
00:00:23.066 --> 00:00:24.233
Live up to it

14
00:00:24.933 --> 00:00:26.400
That's what you said.

15
00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:29.700
Hey

16
00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.200
What are you doing in the middle of the night?

17
00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:34.166
Mom, why did you come out?

18
00:00:34.166 --> 00:00:35.066
How did I get out?

19
00:00:35.066 --> 00:00:35.966
Can't I come out?

20
00:00:35.966 --> 00:00:37.666
The cabbage he has raised for more than 20 years?

21
00:00:37.666 --> 00:00:38.800
I'm about to be kicked by a pig

22
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:39.966
Almost unmarried

23
00:00:39.966 --> 00:00:41.766
What does pulling and pulling look like?

24
00:00:41.766 --> 00:00:43.833
Mom, you are so old-fashioned

25
00:00:43.966 --> 00:00:44.900
Like an antique

26
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.766
I don't care. I'm an antique.

27
00:00:46.766 --> 00:00:47.933
So this Xiao Xunlin

28
00:00:47.933 --> 00:00:50.166
A little skill, but it didn't make it to the wedding night

29
00:00:50.166 --> 00:00:51.533
I forbid you to hug each other

30
00:00:51.533 --> 00:00:52.333
Okay, okay.

31
00:00:52.333 --> 00:00:53.500
Go in and sleep

32
00:00:53.533 --> 00:00:55.266
Tomorrow, go to the old lady's place

33
00:00:55.266 --> 00:00:56.333
Why are you going to grandma's place?

34
00:00:56.333 --> 00:00:57.100
This is King's Landing

35
00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.500
Didn't you help our Ye family achieve a major event?

36
00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:00.566
This old gentleman

37
00:01:00.566 --> 00:01:01.366
To be called tomorrow

38
00:01:01.366 --> 00:01:03.566
The whole family is giving him a celebration banquet

39
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:04.766
Really? Hmm?

40
00:01:04.766 --> 00:01:05.866
Great manager

41
00:01:05.866 --> 00:01:06.933
My grandma finally recognized you

42
00:01:06.933 --> 00:01:08.233
That's great.

43
00:01:09.366 --> 00:01:11.433
I just want to eat, I'll come in
