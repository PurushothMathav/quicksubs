1
00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:06.166
The betrothal gift is naturally prepared long ago

2
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:10.900
30 gold bars

3
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:14.266
A pair of ice arch jadeite bracelets

4
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.500
Aquamarine Dream Diamond Necklace

5
00:00:17.766 --> 00:00:20.266
Luxury yacht misses

6
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.133
Such a cliché bride price

7
00:00:22.133 --> 00:00:23.433
What's wrong with leapfrogging?

8
00:00:24.666 --> 00:00:26.433
Miss Ye is in a hurry

9
00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.366
The bride price may be a bit cliché

10
00:00:28.366 --> 00:00:29.966
But it's also a piece of my heart

11
00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:32.166
Can you accept it?

12
00:00:32.166 --> 00:00:34.533
It's more than a cliché

13
00:00:34.533 --> 00:00:35.833
It's shabby.

14
00:00:38.666 --> 00:00:39.700
As long as it is your heart

15
00:00:40.166 --> 00:00:41.566
I will not dislike

16
00:00:42.533 --> 00:00:43.900
Ah, Manager Xiao

17
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.233
I think you are a fool.

18
00:00:46.266 --> 00:00:48.366
I've seen people eat and drink

19
00:00:48.366 --> 00:00:50.400
I've never seen a bride price

20
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:51.366
What do you mean?

21
00:00:51.366 --> 00:00:52.800
What do I mean?

22
00:00:53.533 --> 00:00:54.800
See clearly

23
00:00:54.966 --> 00:00:56.400
Here is the invoice.

24
00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.166
These betrothal gifts are prepared by Lao Tzu

25
00:00:59.166 --> 00:01:03.766
Hmph, you almost stole the show.

26
00:01:04.733 --> 00:01:07.900
Shen Jiajia, don't you want a yacht?

27
00:01:08.133 --> 00:01:09.233
I'll buy it for you.

28
00:01:09.733 --> 00:01:11.000
How about marrying me?

29
00:01:11.133 --> 00:01:12.100
It's actually a yacht.

30
00:01:12.966 --> 00:01:15.400
Mr. Wang, you are so kind to me.

31
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.600
The yacht king of tens of millions always says to buy it

32
00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.266
Not like some people.

33
00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.233
Even the bride price has to be rubbed against others

34
00:01:23.333 --> 00:01:24.533
It's disgusting

35
00:01:24.533 --> 00:01:26.600
I said why are these things so vulgar?

36
00:01:26.866 --> 00:01:27.900
It was you

37
00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:30.900
Hutong, you kid call me cliché

38
00:01:31.133 --> 00:01:33.366
If you have the ability, you can give me something elegant.

39
00:01:33.366 --> 00:01:34.666
Oh, Mr. Wang

40
00:01:34.866 --> 00:01:37.266
We don't get angry with this kind of person

41
00:01:37.266 --> 00:01:40.866
I don't know. Well, unlike some people.

42
00:01:40.866 --> 00:01:43.000
The bride price has to be rubbed against others

43
00:01:43.266 --> 00:01:45.066
I guess I'll have a meal here

44
00:01:45.066 --> 00:01:47.433
It's going to cost three years' salary

45
00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.066
How can I have the money to buy a betrothal gift?
