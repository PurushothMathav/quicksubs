00:00:05.666 --> 00:00:07.033
They didn't do anything to you, did they?

2
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.833
Tingting, why are you here?

3
00:00:09.866 --> 00:00:11.666
I'm here to see Gu

4
00:00:11.666 --> 00:00:13.633
The happy news of the cooperation between the Xu two families

5
00:00:13.733 --> 00:00:15.400
Yes, Wang Mingxuan

6
00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:16.566
Put your plan just now

7
00:00:16.566 --> 00:00:18.033
Demonstrate it to Mr. Gu again

8
00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:19.766
Ok, no problem.

9
00:00:20.966 --> 00:00:23.566
Since you said you did the planning

10
00:00:23.933 --> 00:00:25.833
Then what are the details of it?

11
00:00:25.966 --> 00:00:28.666
You must know everything.

12
00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:30.100
Yes

13
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:31.400
Ah!

14
00:00:32.166 --> 00:00:34.966
Then I ask you the third page of the PPT

15
00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.166
How many lines are there?

16
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:41.566
No.13

17
00:00:41.566 --> 00:00:43.166
Uh no uh

18
00:00:43.166 --> 00:00:44.466
No. 11 is wrong.

19
00:00:44.466 --> 00:00:48.433
It's the tenth, because you have obsessive-compulsive disorder in the transaction.

20
00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.600
He thought the 10-line projection was the best.

21
00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.333
You don't even know how many lines of PowerPoint there are

22
00:00:55.333 --> 00:00:57.600
And the face to say you did it

23
00:00:58.366 --> 00:01:01.400
Yunting, how do you know that Jiang Yun has no words?

24
00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:03.833
Jiang Yining used to be my secretary

25
00:01:03.866 --> 00:01:05.433
Of course I know.

26
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.733
Although you are an employee of Xu's

27
00:01:08.733 --> 00:01:11.166
But my story is not vegetarian

28
00:01:11.166 --> 00:01:12.566
Want to kill you

29
00:01:12.966 --> 00:01:14.500
Easy

30
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.466
Mr. Gu is the wrong case that I plagiarized the wine

31
00:01:20.166 --> 00:01:21.133
Please forgive me.

32
00:01:21.133 --> 00:01:22.700
This time it's really because

33
00:01:23.366 --> 00:01:25.500
I was just trying to scare you

34
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.233
Even if you have the guts, you don't dare to attack

35
00:01:28.866 --> 00:01:29.666
Say

36
00:01:30.333 --> 00:01:32.100
Who is behind the scenes?

37
00:01:39.733 --> 00:01:40.800
What are you still doing?

38
00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:42.233
Drag him out for me

39
00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:44.400
You get in there

40
00:01:48.266 --> 00:01:49.000
Thank you. Thank you.

41
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.300
Xiaotian is my obsession

42
00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:51.500
My final plan

43
00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:52.533
I'm old and young

44
00:01:52.533 --> 00:01:53.533
I can't live without any work

45
00:01:53.533 --> 00:01:54.700
Please quickly beg Mr. Gu

46
00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:56.200
Hurry up and open a village entrance

47
00:01:57.166 --> 00:01:59.366
What you do by yourself is borne by yourself

48
00:01:59.866 --> 00:02:00.366
No no no

49
00:02:00.366 --> 00:02:02.366
I must still ask you about this.

50
00:02:02.366 --> 00:02:04.566
I believe I can ask you to help me
