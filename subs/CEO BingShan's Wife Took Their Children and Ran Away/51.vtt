00:00:04.166 --> 00:00:05.700
Hey Xiaojiang

2
00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:07.400
You go to the Langting Club at night

3
00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:08.800
Accompany Mr. Sun of Zhengtai Group

4
00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.600
Gotta get the contract today

5
00:00:11.133 --> 00:00:14.466
It's me and Mr. Sun who have only met once

6
00:00:14.466 --> 00:00:15.600
This kind of thing

7
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.666
Let the colleagues in the business department follow it up.

8
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.333
People are impressed with you

9
00:00:20.333 --> 00:00:21.600
Roll call wants you to go

10
00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.533
If you don't go, it's the order you got.

11
00:00:24.533 --> 00:00:27.100
If you fly, you will be fired.

12
00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.300
Just to accompany the wine

13
00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.500
That's a senior club, what are you afraid of?

14
00:00:32.566 --> 00:00:35.166
Fine. I'll do it.

15
00:00:39.066 --> 00:00:40.466
Wait until this is done

16
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.233
Just quit your job.

17
00:00:49.566 --> 00:00:53.033
Xiao Jiang, you didn't drink a glass of wine tonight

18
00:00:54.333 --> 00:00:57.400
Mr. Sun, I'm pregnant and can't drink

19
00:00:57.866 --> 00:01:00.033
It's okay to have a drink

20
00:01:01.166 --> 00:01:03.300
Otherwise, it will get out today.

21
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.566
Where do I put my face?

22
00:01:05.766 --> 00:01:08.200
So today you drink this glass of wine

23
00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.733
This game is over

24
00:01:09.733 --> 00:01:10.533
Contract

25
00:01:10.966 --> 00:01:12.766
Go back and I'll sign it for you right away

26
00:01:15.933 --> 00:01:17.033
Ok Mr. Song

27
00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:18.433
I'll just have a drink

28
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.000
Hey.

29
00:01:24.666 --> 00:01:26.900
Hey, that's right

30
00:01:29.133 --> 00:01:30.900
Hey, Xiao Jiang

31
00:01:30.966 --> 00:01:31.600
Are you all right?

32
00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:32.400
Yeah.

33
00:01:32.933 --> 00:01:35.000
If you drink too much, take a break next to you

34
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.766
Are you alright, Xiaojiang is alright?

35
00:01:44.266 --> 00:01:45.466
It smells so good.

36
00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:48.900
Mr. Song, what are you doing?

37
00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:50.866
You let me go

38
00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:53.066
Please don't do this, really.
