Secretary Gu Zongjiang is doing well in the Xu enterprise

2
00:00:10.266 --> 00:00:13.500
Mr. Gu has a saying that I don't know if it should be said or not.

3
00:00:13.733 --> 00:00:16.566
Saying that what you said that night was indeed too much

00:00:16.566 --> 00:00:18.333
Your Secretary Xiao's temper and skills

5
00:00:18.333 --> 00:00:19.866
Probably won't come back.

6
00:00:19.866 --> 00:00:21.100
You want to go back

7
00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:24.900
go out

8
00:00:26.166 --> 00:00:27.000
Yes

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.000
Zhang Yini

10
00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.500
Is my wife tired?

11
00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.400
Why don't I give you a hug?

12
00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:50.633
Who is this man?

13
00:00:50.733 --> 00:00:52.033
He's my husband.

14
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.700
We met at Xu's

15
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.600
He doesn't care who my child is

16
00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:56.900
We are in love now

17
00:00:57.533 --> 00:00:58.966
Goodbye Guo Yunting

18
00:01:04.366 --> 00:01:05.166
Zhang Yini

19
00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:06.700
Zhang Yini

20
00:01:09.666 --> 00:01:10.666
Educate you

21
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.166
Don't let you leave me

22
00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:18.900
Maybe the story is always better

23
00:01:18.933 --> 00:01:22.000
Xu is the group Xu Jiao is about your age

24
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.400
You consider it

25
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.233
Mom

26
00:01:24.766 --> 00:01:26.700
I have to make my own decisions about marriage

27
00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:29.233
What are you talking about?

28
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.966
Do you still have me as a mother in your eyes?

29
00:01:33.266 --> 00:01:37.266
I heard a while ago that you are still raising women in Zhenyuan

30
00:01:37.266 --> 00:01:38.866
Who are you?

31
00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:40.866
It's normal to have a lover

32
00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:44.400
But marriage is to help the company

33
00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:45.366
Mom

34
00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.866
The company's profits are rising every year

35
00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.100
I don't need women in business

36
00:01:52.133 --> 00:01:53.966
The Qing Dynasty has been playing for 300 years

37
00:01:53.966 --> 00:01:56.033
A soul sword like a marriage is broken

38
00:01:56.166 --> 00:01:59.000
The sooner you cancel, the better.

39
00:01:59.133 --> 00:02:01.533
You've got wings now.

40
00:02:01.533 --> 00:02:03.466
I can't control you, can I?

41
00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.600
Tingting, why are you free to stay at home today?

42
00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:21.400
Come see grandma

43
00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:22.133
By the way.

44
00:02:22.133 --> 00:02:25.066
Tell grandma you're going to have a granddaughter-in-law soon

45
00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.966
What does the granddaughter-in-law look like?

46
00:02:27.966 --> 00:02:29.266
Show grandma
