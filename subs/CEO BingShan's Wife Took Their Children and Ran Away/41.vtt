00:00:05.666 --> 00:00:06.633
Hello vice president

2
00:00:06.966 --> 00:00:09.866
I heard that your planning ability is even recognized by my mother

3
00:00:09.933 --> 00:00:12.600
Let's see what you can teach this time

4
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.400
The vice president joked that we may be full of talents

5
00:00:15.566 --> 00:00:17.566
Just say my ability is the most average

6
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:23.566
I think my mouth is slippery

7
00:00:23.966 --> 00:00:26.666
This time I got you away, no surname Xu

8
00:00:28.066 --> 00:00:30.866
Mom, let Wang Mingxuan speak first

9
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:31.700
OK

10
00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.266
Ok, thank you Mr. Xu

11
00:00:34.266 --> 00:00:35.833
Colleagues, please join us

12
00:00:37.533 --> 00:00:39.300
About this time Xu Shi

13
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.866
Real estate projects jointly invested with stories

14
00:00:41.966 --> 00:00:44.200
It's called the TT Building.

15
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.933
The TT building is shaped like a t

16
00:00:46.933 --> 00:00:48.300
Wait a minute Mr. Xu

17
00:00:48.666 --> 00:00:49.866
This is my PPT.

18
00:00:51.533 --> 00:00:53.533
Wang Mixuan, forget about plagiarizing

19
00:00:53.533 --> 00:00:55.200
Are you too lazy to change a word?

20
00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.700
Xiao Jiang, what the hell is going on?

21
00:00:59.666 --> 00:01:02.000
You in Xinjiang say I plagiarize

22
00:01:02.333 --> 00:01:04.200
Do you have evidence for your karma?

23
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:06.766
Jiang Corn, you said Wang Mingxuan plagiarized

24
00:01:06.866 --> 00:01:08.366
Do you have any evidence?

25
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.133
The founding of Congress is that you did not make a plan yourself

26
00:01:11.133 --> 00:01:12.866
Just frame Wang Mingxuan

27
00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:14.900
I don't have it.

28
00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.633
Ronaldinho, you are sitting opposite Jiang Yinning

29
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:19.900
You say

30
00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:21.966
Yeah, Ronaldinho.

31
00:01:22.066 --> 00:01:23.866
Did you see me planning last night?

32
00:01:23.866 --> 00:01:25.033
You know best

33
00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:26.200
Ronaldinho?

34
00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.500
I like people who are realistic and tell the truth

35
00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.266
You testify

36
00:01:33.166 --> 00:01:34.900
It seems that Xu Jiao wants Gou Yining

37
00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:36.066
For my work

38
00:01:36.066 --> 00:01:37.466
Yining, I'm sorry.

39
00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.166
Why didn't our school copy your idea?

40
00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.000
Haha Ronaldinho

41
00:01:43.666 --> 00:01:45.400
How would you lie?

42
00:01:45.533 --> 00:01:48.200
Jiang Yining, you are still arguing

43
00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:48.933
We promise

44
00:01:48.933 --> 00:01:51.166
I don't need a fake employee like you.

45
00:01:51.166 --> 00:01:52.366
Go away

46
00:01:53.766 --> 00:01:54.666
I can quit my job.

47
00:01:54.666 --> 00:01:55.566
But I don't accept it.

48
00:01:55.566 --> 00:01:56.933
You are buried for no reason

49
00:01:56.933 --> 00:01:59.066
Frame me and be stubborn

50
00:01:59.166 --> 00:02:01.300
Security, pull him out of here

51
00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:02.100
you

52
00:02:02.866 --> 00:02:03.666
Stop
