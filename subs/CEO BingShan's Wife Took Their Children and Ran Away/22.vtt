00:00:01.933 --> 00:00:04.300
Mr. Gu, why did you come in?

2
00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:05.400
Zipper Taika

3
00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:07.000
My hands are weak

4
00:00:07.066 --> 00:00:09.300
Please help me pull it. Okay.

5
00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:10.833
I'll help you out first

6
00:00:14.533 --> 00:00:16.266
Mr. Gu, slow down

7
00:00:16.933 --> 00:00:21.200
I don't remember the feel after I got the eight-pack abs.

8
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:22.466
What a pity!

9
00:00:24.466 --> 00:00:26.833
Mr. Gu, don't move yet

10
00:00:26.866 --> 00:00:29.166
I'll zip it up for you.

11
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:37.400
Ah!

12
00:00:38.533 --> 00:00:39.666
You did it on purpose

13
00:00:39.666 --> 00:00:41.066
I'm not.

14
00:00:41.366 --> 00:00:43.566
It was a mistake. It was a mistake.

15
00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:02.500
Mr. Du

16
00:01:05.166 --> 00:01:08.600
Ah, let me get you a dress from here.

17
00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.500
The workmanship of this dress on you is so rough.

18
00:01:12.566 --> 00:01:13.733
It must be uncomfortable to wear

19
00:01:13.733 --> 00:01:14.866
Change it now

20
00:01:15.066 --> 00:01:18.166
Which eye did you see that I was uncomfortable wearing?

21
00:01:20.333 --> 00:01:23.600
Don't you never wear Dylan clothes?

22
00:01:24.533 --> 00:01:25.966
It's not worn before.

23
00:01:25.966 --> 00:01:29.766
I feel comfortable wearing it now, okay?

24
00:01:29.766 --> 00:01:30.566
Light Snow

25
00:01:31.366 --> 00:01:33.566
I've noticed that you've been talking a little too much lately

26
00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.466
Is it too idle?

27
00:01:35.866 --> 00:01:38.266
I've been working overtime at the company these days.

28
00:01:38.933 --> 00:01:42.166
If you are so busy, please hurry back to the company.

29
00:01:42.166 --> 00:01:43.966
It's enough to have Jiangmi here

30
00:01:44.133 --> 00:01:46.766
Obviously you asked me to bring my pajamas

31
00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.066
With a female secretary, you dislike me

32
00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.966
Mr. Gu, it's getting late

33
00:02:02.966 --> 00:02:05.500
Why don't you rest early?
