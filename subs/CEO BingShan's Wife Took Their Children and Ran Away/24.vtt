00:00:01.166 --> 00:00:01.966
Secretary Jiang

2
00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.233
Please explain your behavior just now

3
00:00:04.266 --> 00:00:05.900
Uh that

4
00:00:08.066 --> 00:00:09.400
Uh, Mr. Gu

5
00:00:09.533 --> 00:00:12.533
Did I just sleepwalk?

6
00:00:12.533 --> 00:00:13.700
What sleepwalking?

7
00:00:13.866 --> 00:00:17.100
Oh, you don't know me, do you?

8
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.966
As long as you are tired, it is easy to sleepwalk

9
00:00:19.966 --> 00:00:22.366
We are too tired for this business trip.

10
00:00:22.666 --> 00:00:24.766
I'm doing it again

11
00:00:25.266 --> 00:00:26.700
It was a dream.

12
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.866
Yes, uh, Mr. Gu

13
00:00:29.866 --> 00:00:33.300
If I do anything out of line with you

14
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.233
Don't take it to heart

15
00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.400
It's okay, you can rest. Okay.

16
00:00:58.366 --> 00:00:59.466
I don't know why.

17
00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.000
There was an inexplicable familiarity about him

18
00:01:02.766 --> 00:01:04.666
The person I slept with that night

19
00:01:04.966 --> 00:01:06.500
Is it really Lin Xiaoxiao?

20
00:01:12.766 --> 00:01:13.566
Hello

21
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.166
Xiaoju, go check it for me.

22
00:01:16.166 --> 00:01:17.366
It was one month ago.

23
00:01:17.366 --> 00:01:20.633
At Langting Cabinet, the access surveillance in my room is

24
00:01:27.866 --> 00:01:29.366
Beautiful woman, Zhiwei

25
00:01:29.866 --> 00:01:31.233
It's hard work to advocate coming back

26
00:01:31.266 --> 00:01:32.400
I bought the food in advance

27
00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.100
I'll make it up for you later.

28
00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.133
Hey, don't you know?

29
00:01:36.133 --> 00:01:37.733
More than hard work

30
00:01:37.733 --> 00:01:39.300
It cost me half my life

31
00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.466
But it's good to have your head. Let's go.

32
00:01:48.533 --> 00:01:49.366
Come on in.

33
00:01:58.133 --> 00:01:59.400
What's wrong with you

34
00:02:00.166 --> 00:02:01.466
Come, sit down first

35
00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:04.500
What's up?

36
00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.100
Did you eat a bad stomach? It's alright.

37
00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:08.666
So serious

38
00:02:08.666 --> 00:02:10.866
Why don't I take you to the hospital for a check-up?

39
00:02:10.866 --> 00:02:12.866
Ah, no need.

40
00:02:12.866 --> 00:02:14.766
Hey, no, what if the delay is serious?

41
00:02:14.766 --> 00:02:17.100
Let's go, Zhiwei

42
00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.300
Actually I'm not sick

43
00:02:20.333 --> 00:02:22.633
Then what's wrong with you?

44
00:02:24.066 --> 00:02:25.466
I'm pregnant.

45
00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.666
One month before pregnancy

46
00:02:29.666 --> 00:02:32.966
I got drunk and had sex with Gu Yunting

47
00:02:33.266 --> 00:02:36.200
Just Gu Yunting, she doesn't like children

48
00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.433
So I'm going to have him alone

49
00:02:39.733 --> 00:02:41.600
Don't worry too much

50
00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.100
We have been friends for so many years

51
00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:45.166
Your child is my child

52
00:02:45.166 --> 00:02:46.600
I would like to be the godfather of my child

53
00:02:47.333 --> 00:02:49.600
Just because I don't want to drag you down

54
00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:50.900
Don't worry.

55
00:02:51.066 --> 00:02:52.766
I can handle it alone

56
00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:03.400
It was one month ago.

57
00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.900
The person who slept with me at the Langham Club

58
00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:07.466
Is it you?

59
00:03:07.466 --> 00:03:11.200
You tell me the truth now and I can spare you
