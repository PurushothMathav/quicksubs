00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:03.600
Zhang Yining's husband, right?

2
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.600
Look at your wife's virtue

3
00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:07.366
Still looking for a man outside

4
00:00:09.066 --> 00:00:11.000
Yunting, how is it you?

5
00:00:12.266 --> 00:00:13.700
How am I?

6
00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:15.600
Are you disappointed?

7
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.066
Nope.

8
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:22.833
Hey, hey, hey.

9
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.133
Say who is behind the scenes

10
00:00:28.133 --> 00:00:30.233
It's none of my business, Mr. Gu

11
00:00:31.566 --> 00:00:33.066
I married the vice president and supported me to do this.

12
00:00:33.066 --> 00:00:34.966
He said he would pay me 10 million when he was done

13
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.933
Don't talk nonsense

14
00:00:35.933 --> 00:00:37.100
It's obviously your intention

15
00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.433
Don't be bloody, you are talking nonsense, Mr. Gu

16
00:00:40.666 --> 00:00:41.766
What's up?

17
00:00:45.166 --> 00:00:47.066
Xu Jiao is suspected of committing a crime

18
00:00:47.533 --> 00:00:49.433
Take him directly to the judiciary

19
00:00:49.666 --> 00:00:52.133
It's stop, you can't do this without me

20
00:00:52.133 --> 00:00:53.666
My mom won't let you go

21
00:00:54.966 --> 00:00:59.233
OK, then I'll ask your mother to take you there herself

22
00:01:00.166 --> 00:01:01.966
Xiao Xu brought back the recruiters

23
00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.733
As for this man

24
00:01:03.733 --> 00:01:05.200
Directly into the labor force

25
00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.366
Get someone to beat him up every day

26
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.800
Don't care

27
00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.200
Mr. Gu, Mr. Gu, I was wrong, I was wrong
