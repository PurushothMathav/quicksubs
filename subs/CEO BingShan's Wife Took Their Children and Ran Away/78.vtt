00:00:05.666 --> 00:00:07.133
Ye Shuanghe is back

2
00:00:07.133 --> 00:00:09.066
He used to be a trainee secretary

3
00:00:09.066 --> 00:00:11.266
And I fell in love with Mr. Gu at first sight

4
00:00:11.266 --> 00:00:12.333
Right?

5
00:00:12.333 --> 00:00:14.566
The secretary suddenly went abroad to study that night

6
00:00:14.566 --> 00:00:15.600
Two people broke

7
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.666
Hey, Jiang Yining seems to be an intern in the secretary department too

8
00:00:18.666 --> 00:00:21.200
And the temperament is also very similar to Ye Shuanghe

9
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.966
You say

10
00:00:21.966 --> 00:00:24.966
Could it be the kind of elevated love in the novel?

11
00:00:25.266 --> 00:00:27.800
What about Jiang Yiming?

12
00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:30.533
Ye Shuanghe was assigned to the Secretary Department as soon as he returned to China

13
00:00:30.533 --> 00:00:32.466
Close contact with Mr. Gu every day

14
00:00:32.466 --> 00:00:34.266
In the future, please suddenly

15
00:00:34.666 --> 00:00:35.966
That's true.

16
00:00:38.966 --> 00:00:41.433
Hey, is that Jiang Yiming?

17
00:00:46.666 --> 00:00:47.466
Nini

18
00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:49.566
What's going on here?

19
00:00:50.733 --> 00:00:51.633
What do you think?

20
00:00:52.333 --> 00:00:53.866
Where were you this morning?

21
00:00:54.466 --> 00:00:55.800
I'm going to work.

22
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.766
You are still lying to me.

23
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.233
What did you and Ye Shuanghe do at Langting Club?

24
00:01:01.466 --> 00:01:02.500
You know best

25
00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.066
Do you need me to tell you?

26
00:01:04.933 --> 00:01:07.666
The rule is that we are only married for one day

27
00:01:08.266 --> 00:01:10.000
I can't help but rekindle my old relationship with him

28
00:01:10.333 --> 00:01:11.133
Li Ming

29
00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.066
I have no relationship with Ye Shuangluo

30
00:01:15.766 --> 00:01:17.000
lonely boy and widowed girl

31
00:01:17.166 --> 00:01:18.966
Do you think I will believe you

32
00:01:18.966 --> 00:01:22.066
Can I not know if I have done it?

33
00:01:23.333 --> 00:01:24.833
Your words are so hard to say

34
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.966
Didn't you just mistake Colonel Lin Xia for him before?

35
00:01:30.266 --> 00:01:31.766
Let me forgive you

36
00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.000
You kicked him out of the story

37
00:01:36.566 --> 00:01:38.966
He is out of work now.

38
00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:41.033
How do I

39
00:01:41.933 --> 00:01:43.366
Mr. Gu is distressed

40
00:01:44.733 --> 00:01:47.700
Yes, Yueshuanghe is your first love

41
00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:49.100
Your white moonlight

42
00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.166
I saw him and I just found out

43
00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.533
Me and his personality

44
00:01:53.533 --> 00:01:55.433
Identity opportunities are so similar

45
00:01:55.566 --> 00:01:57.966
Are you using me as his replacement?

46
00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:00.066
Of course not.

47
00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:01.233
Nope.

48
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.866
Do you like this piece?

49
00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:07.600
Guo Yuntian, I remember I said

50
00:02:07.666 --> 00:02:09.933
If one day you do something wrong to me

51
00:02:09.933 --> 00:02:11.600
I will leave with the child.

52
00:02:12.866 --> 00:02:13.666
Tingting

53
00:02:13.933 --> 00:02:14.800
And so forth.

54
00:02:15.966 --> 00:02:17.400
You can go

55
00:02:17.566 --> 00:02:19.433
But the child is a family

56
00:02:19.533 --> 00:02:21.666
You can't leave until you have a baby
