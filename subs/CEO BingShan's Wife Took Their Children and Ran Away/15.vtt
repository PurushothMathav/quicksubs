00:00:04.466 --> 00:00:05.266
how

2
00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.233
Secretary Jiang is in a hurry to go back.

3
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:09.466
Nope.

4
00:00:10.166 --> 00:00:10.600
OK

5
00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:13.500
If there's overtime, don't worry.

6
00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:17.700
Boss, our company's overtime pay is 3 times, right?

7
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:18.966
I'll give you 10 times.

8
00:00:18.966 --> 00:00:20.433
Haha boss atmosphere

9
00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.566
Do you only have overtime pay in your eyes?

10
00:00:23.733 --> 00:00:25.266
I don't see overtime pay

11
00:00:25.366 --> 00:00:26.700
Could it be you?

12
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.300
Change

13
00:00:30.766 --> 00:00:32.700
Mr. Gu, let me pour you a cup of tea

14
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.233
This lip

15
00:00:40.366 --> 00:00:41.433
This feeling

16
00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:44.366
Sorry boss

17
00:00:44.366 --> 00:00:45.833
I didn't mean to.

18
00:00:46.166 --> 00:00:49.200
You look a lot like the woman I met at the Langham Club

19
00:00:49.666 --> 00:00:50.666
Really?

20
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.833
Do you have a cloud birthmark on your body?

21
00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.800
No, on the night of June 25th.

22
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.000
You've been to Langping. Nice

23
00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.666
Neither

24
00:01:06.566 --> 00:01:08.500
If I let you know you're lying

25
00:01:08.666 --> 00:01:10.633
Regret clearly

26
00:01:14.866 --> 00:01:16.900
Miss Lin is not feeling well

27
00:01:19.066 --> 00:01:20.933
If you are not feeling well, can you find a doctor?

28
00:01:20.933 --> 00:01:21.966
Why are you looking for me?

29
00:01:22.533 --> 00:01:25.100
Miss Cocoa Lin has passed out of pain

30
00:01:40.066 --> 00:01:42.400
This person's voice sounds like Xiaoxiao
