1
00:00:06.933 --> 00:00:08.900
Nini, you're awake

2
00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:10.866
This is a hospital.

3
00:00:11.166 --> 00:00:14.066
Don't be afraid of my child

4
00:00:14.533 --> 00:00:16.066
The doctor has checked

5
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:17.666
Our table is fine.

6
00:00:17.933 --> 00:00:20.166
We are here

7
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:22.100
It was a cloud birthmark

8
00:00:22.366 --> 00:00:26.400
Did you go to the Langping Club on June 25th?

9
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.400
Right?

10
00:00:28.533 --> 00:00:30.366
You still want to hide it from me

11
00:00:30.366 --> 00:00:31.366
Still want to run

12
00:00:32.066 --> 00:00:34.500
The only surveillance has restored you

13
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.300
You're the one I've been looking for

14
00:00:39.133 --> 00:00:41.033
Don't hurt the child

15
00:00:41.666 --> 00:00:43.700
I will definitely be responsible for you and the child.

16
00:00:43.866 --> 00:00:44.533
But that day

17
00:00:44.533 --> 00:00:47.300
I heard you in the hallway saying you were going to get rid of us

18
00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:48.300
I was at that time

19
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.266
The person who didn't know at that time was you

20
00:00:50.266 --> 00:00:53.400
I wanted to give a sum of money at that time, but I couldn't get it.

21
00:00:53.466 --> 00:00:54.966
I know he is yours.

22
00:00:54.966 --> 00:00:57.100
I will make it up to you with my life

23
00:00:57.733 --> 00:00:59.266
You like me

24
00:00:59.533 --> 00:01:01.600
Those who still like that night

25
00:01:02.466 --> 00:01:04.633
If it's just because of that night

26
00:01:06.466 --> 00:01:07.966
How responsible are you?

27
00:01:08.933 --> 00:01:10.033
What are you thinking?

28
00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:13.100
Did you say everything before in vain?

29
00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:14.633
Whoever you are

30
00:01:15.366 --> 00:01:16.933
No matter who the baby is in the womb

31
00:01:16.933 --> 00:01:19.100
All I like is you

32
00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:20.000
Only you

33
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:20.833
Jiang Yining

34
00:01:21.866 --> 00:01:22.666
Mr. Gu

35
00:01:23.733 --> 00:01:24.533
primary school

36
00:01:25.266 --> 00:01:26.600
Is that how it's going?

37
00:01:26.733 --> 00:01:28.400
The murderer is dead outside the wall

38
00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.633
Please investigate the virtual driving school

39
00:01:31.266 --> 00:01:33.566
Little dead you know

40
00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.966
Then it all loses

41
00:01:37.966 --> 00:01:40.800
It was Ling Xiaoxiao Dingtian

42
00:01:41.133 --> 00:01:44.266
I was in a hurry to leave that night

43
00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.366
But left his resume behind

44
00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.800
Although he did a lot of bad things

45
00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.766
But we grew up together.

46
00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:54.833
I'm still a little sad

47
00:01:55.533 --> 00:01:57.200
With Lin Xiaoxiao's ability

48
00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.433
He shouldn't be that capable

49
00:01:59.533 --> 00:02:00.966
And a bunch of mixed bones

50
00:02:01.166 --> 00:02:03.366
Orchestrating a kidnapping

51
00:02:03.366 --> 00:02:06.800
I think the mastermind must be someone else

52
00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.966
You mean Xiao Xiao is being used by others?

53
00:02:11.566 --> 00:02:14.233
Yunting, you must find out the truth!

54
00:02:17.933 --> 00:02:19.433
Don't worry, promise.

55
00:02:19.533 --> 00:02:20.666
Start today.

56
00:02:20.666 --> 00:02:23.166
I won't let you get hurt any more

57
00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:28.833
Is grandma okay?

58
00:02:31.066 --> 00:02:33.400
granddaughter-in-law old lady

59
00:02:33.733 --> 00:02:35.166
Why are you here?
