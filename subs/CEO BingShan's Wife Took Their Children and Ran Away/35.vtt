So handsome

2
00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:04.300
I have a granddaughter-in-law

3
00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:08.766
Nice. Does your wife work in your company?

4
00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:11.700
No, he works in the dorm.

5
00:00:12.466 --> 00:00:13.433
Oh yes grandma

6
00:00:13.766 --> 00:00:15.100
Did you take your medicine today?

7
00:00:15.166 --> 00:00:16.700
I ran out of medicine yesterday

8
00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:19.966
Can I stop eating in the future?

9
00:00:19.966 --> 00:00:21.066
No way.

10
00:00:21.333 --> 00:00:24.566
Grandma, this medicine can help you delay the decline of the drug

11
00:00:24.566 --> 00:00:25.866
I have to eat it every day.

12
00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.100
I'll go to the hospital to buy it for you. Wow.

13
00:00:30.733 --> 00:00:33.233
Oh so good

14
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.400
I have a granddaughter-in-law

15
00:00:38.533 --> 00:00:40.866
Oops, did you hear?

16
00:00:40.866 --> 00:00:42.500
I have a granddaughter-in-law

17
00:00:42.533 --> 00:00:44.566
Sun-in-law, right?

18
00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.333
It's beautiful.

19
00:00:46.333 --> 00:00:49.066
I heard that I work at Xu's

20
00:00:49.133 --> 00:00:50.833
Xu's work

21
00:00:51.733 --> 00:00:53.466
Hey tough mouth

22
00:00:53.533 --> 00:00:55.366
What do you say you disagree with?

23
00:00:55.533 --> 00:00:56.700
In private?

24
00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:58.566
That's pretty quick.

25
00:00:59.666 --> 00:01:01.900
No, I have to help him.

26
00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.366
Hurry up and marry Xu Jiao back

27
00:01:08.966 --> 00:01:11.733
Mr. Xu listened to Yunting's meaning?

28
00:01:11.733 --> 00:01:13.366
I like Jiaojiao

29
00:01:14.166 --> 00:01:16.566
Just in time, Jiaojiao's birthday party is also here

30
00:01:16.566 --> 00:01:20.100
How about getting engaged at a birthday party?

31
00:01:20.533 --> 00:01:23.433
So that's a happy addition.

32
00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:25.766
Mom, please promise

33
00:01:25.966 --> 00:01:30.033
Ouch, it's really a girl who can't help it

34
00:01:30.666 --> 00:01:34.800
Let's let Xiao Gu discuss the details of the engagement

35
00:01:34.866 --> 00:01:37.966
Yunting, the announcement is quite busy, so be it

36
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.266
Hide this from her first

37
00:01:40.566 --> 00:01:41.566
When is the time?

38
00:01:41.566 --> 00:01:43.700
I gave him a surprise
