00:00:01.366 --> 00:00:03.833
Who are you looking for?

2
00:00:04.133 --> 00:00:05.766
Are you Lin Xiaoxiao?

3
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.300
On the night of June 25th

4
00:00:09.666 --> 00:00:12.766
Was it you who slept with me at the Langping Club?

5
00:00:16.733 --> 00:00:18.466
A year of shame

6
00:00:18.466 --> 00:00:20.200
Where did you go all night?

7
00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:21.933
What about the resume I let you win?

8
00:00:21.933 --> 00:00:23.833
Ah, I'm sorry, Xiang Xiang

9
00:00:24.066 --> 00:00:25.600
We had a company party yesterday.

10
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.866
I drank too much and slept in Langting

11
00:00:27.933 --> 00:00:30.500
Probably just lost your resume there

12
00:00:30.933 --> 00:00:35.333
It seems that Nai Wan Yining and Guo Yunting slept together

13
00:00:35.333 --> 00:00:37.200
What kind of shit luck did he step on?

14
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.266
How can a top rich man sleep at this level?

15
00:00:40.333 --> 00:00:42.966
However, Jiang Yilin has always regarded herself as noble

16
00:00:42.966 --> 00:00:44.300
Naiwan escaped

17
00:00:44.566 --> 00:00:47.066
It means that I don't want to be involved with Guo Yunting

18
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:51.100
I just happened to take his place and fly up the branches to become a phoenix

19
00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:58.200
It's me, Mr. Gu. I drank too much that night

20
00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.033
Adult so soon

21
00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.600
Then why did you leave that day?

22
00:01:02.733 --> 00:01:04.433
It's my first time.

23
00:01:04.933 --> 00:01:06.566
I don't know you.

24
00:01:06.566 --> 00:01:09.166
So I ran away in fear

25
00:01:09.333 --> 00:01:10.833
This bracelet

26
00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.000
Xiao Xu arranged for him to live in the city park

27
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.600
Let's have dinner together after get off work for a year

28
00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.200
Hmm no thanks

29
00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:42.300
I have something else to do

30
00:01:44.766 --> 00:01:46.333
I have asked you out several times.

31
00:01:46.333 --> 00:01:47.766
You refuse every time.

32
00:01:47.766 --> 00:01:49.300
You don't give face

33
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.466
I really have something to do

34
00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.566
Jiang Yining, don't be shameless

35
00:01:54.566 --> 00:01:56.433
I don't wear makeup, I don't wear lipstick.

36
00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.266
Not feminine at all

37
00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:01.000
Are you still wearing that kind of street stall?

38
00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.466
Angry and poor

39
00:02:02.466 --> 00:02:04.033
If you didn't want a higher degree

40
00:02:04.366 --> 00:02:06.400
Except for high-quality men like me

41
00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.666
Who else wants you? Who cares?

42
00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.166
And I have a fiancé

43
00:02:10.166 --> 00:02:13.066
My fiancé's quality is much higher than yours

44
00:02:13.066 --> 00:02:14.133
More handsome than you

45
00:02:14.133 --> 00:02:15.200
My family background is better than yours

46
00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:16.700
A trainee secretary

47
00:02:17.066 --> 00:02:19.700
Don't hurt me with any fiancé

48
00:02:20.733 --> 00:02:22.066
Lie to me

49
00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.000
The Story Employee Code clearly states

50
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.966
Love is not allowed during working hours

51
00:02:26.966 --> 00:02:29.533
You broke the rules by asking me out during work hours

52
00:02:29.533 --> 00:02:31.500
Besides, what happened to the intern?

53
00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.833
Which of your documents was not handled by me for you?

54
00:02:33.933 --> 00:02:36.000
Look down on the fact that I won't do it

55
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.466
My story has always been about the able

56
00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.600
What's wrong, Auntie?

57
00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.966
I'm leaving. Gu Yunting usually doesn't come to the secretary department.

58
00:02:46.066 --> 00:02:48.166
Did you find me?
