1
00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:03.800
Except for Ye Shuanghe, President Gu's Secretary Department

2
00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:05.300
The rest resigned

3
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:07.300
What about other departments?

4
00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:09.466
Half of the employees in the business department also resigned

5
00:00:09.466 --> 00:00:11.166
If Mr. Gu continues like this

6
00:00:11.166 --> 00:00:13.066
For the upcoming board elections

7
00:00:13.066 --> 00:00:14.066
It's going to be huge.

8
00:00:14.066 --> 00:00:15.900
Are we really not going to retain these employees?

9
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.566
Let's not talk about those who quit.

10
00:00:17.566 --> 00:00:18.266
Light Snow

11
00:00:18.266 --> 00:00:21.866
I remember from the moment I took over the story.

12
00:00:22.266 --> 00:00:23.666
Just follow me.

13
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.666
Are you really not considering leaving?

14
00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:27.400
Resign now

15
00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.233
Your future development

16
00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:30.600
There will be no impact

17
00:00:30.766 --> 00:00:33.466
Mr. Gu, as long as you are still outdated for a day

18
00:00:33.466 --> 00:00:34.866
I will never leave

19
00:00:37.766 --> 00:00:39.733
Secretary, why are you here?

20
00:00:39.733 --> 00:00:41.600
I quit.

21
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:42.600
Looking for a job

22
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:43.166
I would like to ask

23
00:00:43.166 --> 00:00:45.566
Do you have any fear posts here?

24
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:47.466
Of course there is.

25
00:00:47.466 --> 00:00:49.466
Secretary, there is only one employee left now

26
00:00:49.466 --> 00:00:50.633
You just happened to be there

27
00:00:51.266 --> 00:00:53.766
Zijun will hold a board meeting soon

28
00:00:53.933 --> 00:00:56.600
You go check out the preparations for animal society

29
00:00:56.733 --> 00:00:57.766
It's Mr. Gu

30
00:01:00.666 --> 00:01:01.466
Li Ning

31
00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:03.900
Story thing

32
00:01:04.066 --> 00:01:05.166
It has nothing to do with you.

33
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.100
You don't have to be in that muddy water

34
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.066
I'm not here to offer you free labor

35
00:01:10.066 --> 00:01:11.300
Don't think too much.

36
00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:13.433
Oh, really?

37
00:01:14.866 --> 00:01:16.100
You have to be stubborn?

38
00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:17.266
You need to know

39
00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:21.000
The world has always been a place where talents come together and no talents come apart

40
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Only those who are sincere to you

41
00:01:23.466 --> 00:01:24.766
Will be like you

42
00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:26.200
Never leave
