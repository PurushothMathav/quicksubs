00:00:01.266 --> 00:00:04.900
Hey, Mingping has been watching over you these days.

2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.766
I'm sure of that.

3
00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:10.366
Madam, I'm fine

4
00:00:10.366 --> 00:00:11.500
I'm in excellent health.

5
00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:13.666
Oh, poor child.

6
00:00:13.733 --> 00:00:15.100
How talented is how big

7
00:00:15.266 --> 00:00:18.633
This is handed down from the ancestors

8
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.700
The best way to ward off disasters and evil spirits for every generation of hostesses

9
00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:25.733
No, the word old lady is too expensive

10
00:00:25.733 --> 00:00:27.233
Just keep it

11
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:28.866
It was for you.

12
00:00:30.766 --> 00:00:32.033
Thank you, madam

13
00:00:32.466 --> 00:00:33.700
Don't change your mind

14
00:00:34.966 --> 00:00:36.266
Thank you, Grandma.

15
00:00:42.333 --> 00:00:44.366
Nini, are you still weak?

16
00:00:44.366 --> 00:00:47.033
I will ask the housekeeper to find a famous Chinese medicine teacher to communicate with you.

17
00:00:47.366 --> 00:00:48.700
Don't worry.

18
00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:50.300
Not as delicate as you want

19
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.866
You're not alone anymore.

20
00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.000
at least

21
00:00:54.533 --> 00:00:56.266
Think about the baby

22
00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.433
My belly will grow bigger one day

23
00:01:00.666 --> 00:01:03.066
We need to settle our marriage early

24
00:01:03.466 --> 00:01:04.966
Don't worry.

25
00:01:05.066 --> 00:01:08.100
I haven't felt so much like stepping into the grave of marriage

26
00:01:09.666 --> 00:01:11.366
You have all the bracelets

27
00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:12.966
You are pregnant with my child

28
00:01:12.966 --> 00:01:14.200
Who do you want to marry?

29
00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:15.766
Nope.

30
00:01:15.866 --> 00:01:19.233
It's just that I got married without ever being in a relationship

31
00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:20.666
It's too expensive

32
00:01:21.766 --> 00:01:23.366
Can we marry first and then love?

33
00:01:23.666 --> 00:01:25.366
I'm going to your dad to get the money right away

34
00:01:25.366 --> 00:01:28.666
But I grew up at Sunshine Orphanage.

35
00:01:29.666 --> 00:01:31.033
I have no parents.

36
00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.066
Sunshine Orphanage

37
00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.100
Yeah, why?

38
00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.766
Xu Jiao was also killed by Xu Yu in the Sunshine Orphanage

39
00:01:37.766 --> 00:01:39.000
Claimed back

40
00:01:39.733 --> 00:01:42.866
He also has a cosmic tai chi on his back.

41
00:01:43.566 --> 00:01:45.466
It's too coincidental

42
00:01:45.466 --> 00:01:47.266
Then I'll accompany you to the judicial authority

43
00:01:47.333 --> 00:01:49.166
Enter the DNA database

44
00:01:49.166 --> 00:01:50.100
In that case

45
00:01:50.133 --> 00:01:52.233
It's easy to help you get your ex back

46
00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:53.366
Never mind.

47
00:01:53.766 --> 00:01:56.566
They don't want me anymore and I don't want them either
