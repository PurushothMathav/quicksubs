00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:02.500
Mr. Gu

2
00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:07.866
You've got a good idea

3
00:00:07.866 --> 00:00:10.066
Let the interns attack

4
00:00:10.666 --> 00:00:12.633
There's workplace harassment.

5
00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.366
The story doesn't need to be scolded like you, get out of here, aunt

6
00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:19.200
Girl, please be dismissed by the story

7
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.500
No business will accept me.

8
00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:22.966
Mr. Gu, forgive me

9
00:00:22.966 --> 00:00:25.333
Mr. Gu, you just need to stop asking

10
00:00:25.333 --> 00:00:27.066
If you ask again, you will die

11
00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:29.166
Mr. Gu, forgive me, Mr. Gu

12
00:00:32.333 --> 00:00:34.400
Will you come with me?

13
00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.866
Oh, no. He doesn't know about that night

14
00:00:38.966 --> 00:00:41.166
Cut me into eight pieces

15
00:00:52.566 --> 00:00:54.066
You hide deep

16
00:00:59.166 --> 00:01:01.566
Mr. Gu, I know I was wrong

17
00:01:01.566 --> 00:01:03.133
As long as you let me go

18
00:01:03.133 --> 00:01:04.466
I quit immediately

19
00:01:04.566 --> 00:01:05.666
Tube far

20
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:06.666
resign

21
00:01:07.266 --> 00:01:10.266
The monthly salary of the secretary 20,000

22
00:01:10.266 --> 00:01:12.233
No more, turn positive.

23
00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.466
Well, what you just said is well hidden.

24
00:01:15.466 --> 00:01:18.100
Are you articulate?

25
00:01:22.366 --> 00:01:26.166
By the way, what did you just say to let me let you go?

26
00:01:26.166 --> 00:01:28.700
I thought Mr. Gu had found me

27
00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.800
Let me go away with Lin Qiao

28
00:01:30.966 --> 00:01:32.600
I've always rewarded and punished

29
00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.366
You're not wrong. But I don't like forcing people.

30
00:01:36.766 --> 00:01:37.966
If you want to go

31
00:01:38.366 --> 00:01:39.100
Also

32
00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:43.366
Mr. Gu is also a good boss at work

33
00:01:43.966 --> 00:01:46.433
Having a baby is smaller than opening

34
00:01:47.533 --> 00:01:50.800
Why don't I save some money and run away

35
00:01:50.866 --> 00:01:53.500
What are you cooing about?

36
00:01:53.766 --> 00:01:55.433
I would like to become a regular.

37
00:01:55.666 --> 00:01:57.266
Thank you Mr. Gu for your appreciation

38
00:01:57.266 --> 00:01:59.700
I changed my mind quickly

39
00:02:00.366 --> 00:02:02.000
I do it for money

40
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.900
I'm just short of money

41
00:02:04.333 --> 00:02:07.100
20,000 can buy a lot of bags this month

42
00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:08.800
And tidying up?

43
00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.500
greedy for petty cheap?

44
00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.466
You should know my rules.

45
00:02:12.466 --> 00:02:16.266
I picked you to be my life secretary for a living

46
00:02:16.766 --> 00:02:17.633
Secretary

47
00:02:18.166 --> 00:02:19.233
Don't think crooked

48
00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.400
It's just for you to share the work of the community

49
00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.666
Of course I won't think too much about it.

50
00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:28.533
Someone like me with a fiancÃ©

51
00:02:28.533 --> 00:02:30.400
I will never be a little bit of Mr. Gu

52
00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:32.200
Hey, by the way, Xu Tezhu

53
00:02:32.533 --> 00:02:34.500
Can you help me move the box down?

54
00:02:35.066 --> 00:02:37.600
The gold secretary became a box carrier

55
00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.500
I hope Mr. Gu will quickly transfer to a satisfactory life secretary.

56
00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:41.500
OK

57
00:02:44.866 --> 00:02:47.100
Smile, I'm going to get a raise for the transfer today.

58
00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:48.600
Let's go out and celebrate

59
00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:53.500
Never mind.

60
00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.633
Don't let Jiang Yilin recognize Xu Tezhu

61
00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:58.100
