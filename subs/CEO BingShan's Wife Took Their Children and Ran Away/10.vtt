00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:10.033
Why did I hear Xiao Xiao's cell phone ringing just now?

2
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:15.700
I'm busy right now

3
00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:18.600
Make an appointment with Zhiwei in the evening, let's have hot pot and talk in detail

4
00:00:23.966 --> 00:00:26.033
Tea, please, Miss Jiang. Thank you

5
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.866
Uh, I have something to go back to first

6
00:00:28.933 --> 00:00:30.133
I put the stuff here

7
00:00:30.133 --> 00:00:31.766
Please help transfer it.

8
00:00:31.766 --> 00:00:33.900
Ok ok thank you

9
00:00:41.333 --> 00:00:43.266
Isn't Jia Yulin a quartz student?

10
00:00:43.466 --> 00:00:45.266
What qualifications do you have to come to Zheng Yuyu?

11
00:00:46.166 --> 00:00:48.233
He won't regret it, will he?

12
00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.766
Looking for a chance to say what happened to a one-night stand?

13
00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:59.966
Xiao Xiao, you are here, let's go

14
00:01:02.466 --> 00:01:04.500
Xiao Xiao, you have a new bag.

15
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:05.966
This new bag

16
00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:07.433
Can it be cheaper?

17
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.433
Of course. It's the latest HermÃ¨s bag.

18
00:01:11.566 --> 00:01:13.666
The bag is made of platinum

19
00:01:13.666 --> 00:01:16.566
More than 3,000 to 2,180 diamonds above

20
00:01:16.566 --> 00:01:19.733
I said don't waste money

21
00:01:19.733 --> 00:01:22.600
My boyfriend insisted on giving me this limited edition bag.

22
00:01:22.666 --> 00:01:23.633
Annoying

23
00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.066
Okay, you like shabu beef the most. Eat more

24
00:01:31.533 --> 00:01:32.566
Imin

25
00:01:32.566 --> 00:01:35.533
I don't eat this cheap synthetic beef anymore.

26
00:01:35.533 --> 00:01:37.566
My boyfriend specially arranges every meal

27
00:01:37.566 --> 00:01:40.100
The most expensive beef mix by air from abroad

28
00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.766
The taste is nothing compared to this synthetic meat

29
00:01:49.866 --> 00:01:50.666
Thanks.

30
00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:53.400
Don't you have eyes?

31
00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.000
Can you afford my bag for tens of millions?

32
00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.733
Excuse me, let me wipe it for you.

33
00:01:56.733 --> 00:01:59.600
Just your dirty and oily hands trying to touch my bag

34
00:01:59.666 --> 00:02:02.066
If you know, transfer me 100,000 dollars

35
00:02:02.066 --> 00:02:04.366
I'll take it to the store for cleaning and repair.

36
00:02:05.566 --> 00:02:07.100
I'm from the country.

37
00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.466
I just worked for a long time and have no savings

38
00:02:10.366 --> 00:02:12.133
I saved so much money in total

39
00:02:12.133 --> 00:02:14.200
Can I give you all of them?

40
00:02:17.266 --> 00:02:18.400
Here's the money

41
00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.466
Not even a single hemming line in my bag

42
00:02:20.533 --> 00:02:22.033
Call your boss

43
00:02:23.166 --> 00:02:24.200
Get up first

44
00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:26.800
You go out, it's alright

45
00:02:27.733 --> 00:02:28.566
Hey

46
00:02:30.333 --> 00:02:31.133
Xiao Xiao

47
00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.100
We are all ordinary people, why should you make it difficult for him?

48
00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:35.666
What I said is true.

49
00:02:36.066 --> 00:02:38.966
I've got a mansion at the bottom of my bag

50
00:02:39.933 --> 00:02:41.866
Little your bag

51
00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.266
