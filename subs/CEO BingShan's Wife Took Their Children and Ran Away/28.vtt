00:00:01.266 --> 00:00:02.933
Since Mr. Gu thinks my private life is chaotic

2
00:00:02.933 --> 00:00:04.100
Affected the company's image

3
00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:05.400
Then I'll quit.

4
00:00:06.866 --> 00:00:08.300
Jiang Yini, you

5
00:00:10.133 --> 00:00:11.600
Uh, Mr. Gu

6
00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:14.433
Here is a copy of your zero file

7
00:00:14.733 --> 00:00:16.066
I need you to sign it.

8
00:00:27.666 --> 00:00:28.466
Hey

9
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:30.400
Wait a minute.

10
00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:35.800
Xiaoxue, our stories have always been people-oriented

11
00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:39.933
What about this female employee who fired during pregnancy?

12
00:00:39.933 --> 00:00:41.700
It's not humanitarian.

13
00:00:42.166 --> 00:00:46.100
You and I will contact the little secretary immediately.

14
00:00:48.966 --> 00:00:49.866
There are more

15
00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:51.633
You tell him.

16
00:00:51.966 --> 00:00:54.133
Our story will be about

17
00:00:54.133 --> 00:00:57.266
During pregnancy, female employees are paid a stipend

18
00:00:57.533 --> 00:00:58.333
OK

19
00:01:03.133 --> 00:01:06.266
The teaching secretary just replied to me that

20
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:07.666
No.

21
00:01:08.266 --> 00:01:11.100
What?

22
00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:28.400
shy

23
00:01:29.166 --> 00:01:30.466
Why are you here?

24
00:01:30.866 --> 00:01:32.600
I heard this guy say you're pregnant.

25
00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.366
Why didn't you tell me such a big deal?

26
00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.433
Hey, wasn't I afraid you would be worried?

27
00:01:38.566 --> 00:01:40.300
I hear it's too late for you to be happy

28
00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:42.900
Look, these are the bird's nests I bought for you

29
00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:44.200
Bought a tire

30
00:01:49.066 --> 00:01:50.233
Thank you. Thank you.

31
00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.433
You're welcome

32
00:01:52.466 --> 00:01:53.733
The child in your belly

33
00:01:53.733 --> 00:01:55.466
You have to call me godmother

34
00:01:56.066 --> 00:01:57.766
Look at you

35
00:01:57.766 --> 00:01:59.000
I've lost weight

36
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.100
I'll cook a bowl for you and make it up, okay?
