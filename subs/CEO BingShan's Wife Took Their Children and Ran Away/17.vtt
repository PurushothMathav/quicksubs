00:00:03.466 --> 00:00:05.400
Hey, are we all right?

2
00:00:16.133 --> 00:00:18.266
Why are you still thinking about what they said?

3
00:00:18.266 --> 00:00:20.366
Mr. Gu, you just now

4
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.700
Why don't you let me explain it to them?

5
00:00:22.933 --> 00:00:24.600
What time do you waste with strangers?

6
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.966
Don't worry, I'm not interested in wives

7
00:00:26.966 --> 00:00:29.966
I have no idea about you

8
00:00:31.366 --> 00:00:32.600
Ah, yeah, yeah.

9
00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.433
Mr. Gu is concerned about his employees, right?

10
00:00:43.466 --> 00:00:44.800
Hello, check in.

11
00:00:51.266 --> 00:00:53.233
Thank you brother

12
00:00:58.766 --> 00:01:01.066
Mr. Guo, do you like children?

13
00:01:01.766 --> 00:01:04.400
I think children have long cycles.

14
00:01:04.466 --> 00:01:07.233
The worst investment with high or low returns

15
00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.000
In your eyes

16
00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.733
Children are just an investment

17
00:01:10.733 --> 00:01:12.233
It's not even worth investing in.

18
00:01:12.466 --> 00:01:15.566
Investing at least means you can have expectations

19
00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:16.866
Children are out of control

20
00:01:17.166 --> 00:01:18.666
Can't meet expectations

21
00:01:18.666 --> 00:01:21.100
Gu Yunting really can't accept children

22
00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.066
Wait until I save a few more months' salary.

23
00:01:23.266 --> 00:01:24.866
Resign as soon as possible

24
00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:26.700
You like kids.

25
00:01:27.133 --> 00:01:30.600
Well, yeah, I was an orphan.

26
00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.433
I still want to have my own family

27
00:01:32.866 --> 00:01:34.433
But are you a fiancÃ©?

28
00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.000
Of course. We're getting married tonight.

29
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.366
Naturally there is an intention to have children

30
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.233
I want to hold a video conference

31
00:01:45.333 --> 00:01:46.666
You are free at night

32
00:01:47.866 --> 00:01:52.266
Ah, strange, why are you suddenly angry again?

33
00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.933
We have bought all the gifts for Xiaoxiao and Eat.

34
00:01:57.933 --> 00:01:59.066
Go back to sleep.

35
00:02:03.533 --> 00:02:04.366
Where are you going at night?

36
00:02:04.366 --> 00:02:06.133
Sister play with brother?

37
00:02:06.133 --> 00:02:07.000
No.

38
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:08.966
Don't go.

39
00:02:08.966 --> 00:02:11.100
Wearing such a short skirt at night?

40
00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:12.600
Isn't it just to be called Kaizi?

41
00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.166
What can you do all night?
