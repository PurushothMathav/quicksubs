00:00:02.733 --> 00:00:04.766
Don't run I'm here

2
00:00:06.933 --> 00:00:09.800
Um, I'm sorry, Mr. Gu

3
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.266
I got a little too emotional.

4
00:00:12.266 --> 00:00:15.000
Everyone else just cares about my money

5
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.366
You are the first person who truly cares about my life

6
00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.500
By the way, you just said you were hiding something from me.

7
00:00:22.666 --> 00:00:26.266
And what did you say when I fainted?

8
00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.000
It's over, I missed the point.

9
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.466
How should it be round now?

10
00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.733
I mean

11
00:00:33.733 --> 00:00:36.166
I still have a lot of work to report to you.

12
00:00:36.166 --> 00:00:39.433
That and that, me, my salary

13
00:00:39.966 --> 00:00:41.866
I want to go up a little more

14
00:00:43.266 --> 00:00:44.233
Little money fan

15
00:00:44.966 --> 00:00:48.100
Go back and triple it for you.

16
00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.266
Mr. Gu checked the brake pads on the car

17
00:00:57.266 --> 00:00:59.500
Did you do something on purpose?

18
00:00:59.533 --> 00:01:03.000
Second uncle actually has the guts to mess with my car

19
00:01:03.166 --> 00:01:05.866
You take the brake pads to the judicial authority

20
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.433
Make sure he stays in prison for the rest of his life

21
00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.566
I'm going to kill him.

22
00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.566
I can't die

23
00:01:14.533 --> 00:01:16.933
Hey, the rich and powerful have many grudges.

24
00:01:16.933 --> 00:01:19.800
That's not necessarily a good thing.

25
00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.266
Well, Mr. Gu

26
00:01:21.266 --> 00:01:26.366
I'll go to the bathroom to deal with that first.

27
00:01:34.733 --> 00:01:36.300
Xiaoxiao Yiling

28
00:01:36.866 --> 00:01:38.000
What are you doing here?

29
00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.200
My boss and I are on a business trip.

30
00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.766
I didn't expect it to be Jiang Yi who was on a business trip with Gu Yunting

31
00:01:42.766 --> 00:01:45.666
Ling, he won't say anything to Gu Yunting, will he?

32
00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:49.333
Ah, I heard your boss was in an accident.

33
00:01:49.333 --> 00:01:50.500
How is he now?

34
00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:51.866
He's all right.

35
00:01:51.866 --> 00:01:53.700
Just a little injury

36
00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.700
But how did you know my boss was in an accident?

37
00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.066
Uh-huh.

38
00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:59.766
I read on the news

39
00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:01.400
The head of Story Group was involved in a car accident

40
00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.000
It made headlines.

41
00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.600
Xiao Xiao, you are so strange

42
00:02:05.766 --> 00:02:08.066
You don't care about the injury of one of my girlfriends.

43
00:02:08.066 --> 00:02:09.700
Concerned about my boss

44
00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.466
You didn't come to the hospital to see me, did you?

45
00:02:12.533 --> 00:02:15.300
I came to the hospital to visit a former colleague

46
00:02:15.333 --> 00:02:16.666
Just happened to meet you

47
00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.333
See you alive and kicking

48
00:02:18.333 --> 00:02:19.600
I know you're okay.

49
00:02:19.933 --> 00:02:23.000
You care about your boss because you are afraid that he will get hurt.

50
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.366
I didn't expect you to be busy with work

51
00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.066
But fortunately, Mr. Gu was there to protect me

52
00:02:27.066 --> 00:02:28.466
I don't think anything happened

53
00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.400
Protect you, nothing happened between the two of you, right?

54
00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.366
What could happen between me and him?

55
00:02:33.366 --> 00:02:36.700
Hey, it's just that I have to work harder in the future.

56
00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.900
To repay the boss

57
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.866
Let you
