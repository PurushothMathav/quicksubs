00:00:01.466 --> 00:00:03.366
Ah, OK, I see.

2
00:00:04.333 --> 00:00:05.200
What's up?

3
00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:07.766
My boss is poisonous.

4
00:00:07.766 --> 00:00:10.000
He asked me to support overtime now

5
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.133
Don't be too angry.

6
00:00:11.133 --> 00:00:13.100
After all, your salary is double that of mine.

7
00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:14.266
Working overtime is normal

8
00:00:14.533 --> 00:00:17.866
It's just that I may not be able to drive this car.

9
00:00:18.133 --> 00:00:19.266
You can take a taxi

10
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:20.400
No need for that.

11
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.600
It's very close, I'll pass it when I leave.

12
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.700
OK, then you pay attention to safety

13
00:00:31.266 --> 00:00:35.033
Secretary Jiang, Mr. Gu asked me to go in and support

14
00:00:44.133 --> 00:00:45.866
I didn't wear this broken bracelet last time

15
00:00:45.866 --> 00:00:47.466
Obviously angry

16
00:00:47.466 --> 00:00:48.900
This time with a bracelet.

17
00:00:48.966 --> 00:00:50.633
He's going to love it.

18
00:00:50.866 --> 00:00:53.366
Mr. Gu, I made you wolfberry chrysanthemum tea

19
00:00:53.366 --> 00:00:54.466
Can clear the liver and eyesight

20
00:00:54.466 --> 00:00:55.266
Eliminate fatigue

21
00:00:55.266 --> 00:00:57.366
You drink it and leave it alone

22
00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.900
Mr. Gu, you have been tired all day

23
00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:09.600
Do you want me to give you a massage to relax?

24
00:01:11.466 --> 00:01:13.400
I'll give you three seconds.

25
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.266
Disappeared in my study

26
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.466
Why compare this woman who slept all night

27
00:01:27.866 --> 00:01:30.633
I'd rather be with someone else's fiancee

28
00:01:34.866 --> 00:01:35.766
Miss Li

29
00:01:36.333 --> 00:01:38.000
Miss, what are you doing here?
