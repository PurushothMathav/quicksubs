00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:03.833
Secretary Jiang

2
00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:05.900
Come to my office

3
00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:12.700
Jiang Yining, your courage is getting bigger and bigger

4
00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:14.366
How dare you defraud the company?

5
00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:17.066
Concealing pregnancy before joining the job

6
00:00:17.533 --> 00:00:18.666
Do you know

7
00:00:18.666 --> 00:00:21.300
The company reserves the right to track you

8
00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.600
I didn't defraud the company. I

9
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.833
I got pregnant after joining the job

10
00:00:26.866 --> 00:00:29.366
Even if you got pregnant after joining the job

11
00:00:29.366 --> 00:00:31.300
The company pays you a salary

12
00:00:31.366 --> 00:00:34.066
It's not for you to fight your fiancÃ© during work hours

13
00:00:34.066 --> 00:00:35.300
scolding

14
00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:36.733
You saw it too

15
00:00:36.733 --> 00:00:38.100
Those messages are unread

16
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.300
I didn't reply at all.

17
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.000
Really? I think he cares about you.

18
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.066
How about this?

19
00:00:43.066 --> 00:00:44.166
You let him come over

20
00:00:44.533 --> 00:00:47.700
Make an exception to allow him to work with you

21
00:00:47.933 --> 00:00:49.833
Let you work hard

22
00:00:50.166 --> 00:00:52.200
Okay? He's just my friend.

23
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.766
He's not my fiance.

24
00:00:53.766 --> 00:00:55.266
Who is the fiance?

25
00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.500
Mr. Gu, this has nothing to do with you, right?

26
00:00:58.566 --> 00:00:59.800
Even if you pay me

27
00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:00.566
I don't have to either

28
00:01:00.566 --> 00:01:02.366
Tell you all about my private life

29
00:01:05.566 --> 00:01:06.600
irrelevant

30
00:01:08.066 --> 00:01:10.966
I think Secretary Jiang's private life is chaotic

31
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.700
I have no idea who the biological father of the child is

32
00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.633
Gu Yunqi, don't go too far

33
00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.766
Gu Zongsheng is so atmospheric

34
00:01:21.966 --> 00:01:23.500
You're not going to do it.
