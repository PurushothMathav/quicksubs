1
00:00:07.333 --> 00:00:08.266
My mother-in-law

2
00:00:08.266 --> 00:00:09.666
Alzheimer's disease.

3
00:00:09.666 --> 00:00:10.733
What he said

4
00:00:10.733 --> 00:00:13.166
Don't worry about it.

5
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:15.766
Is it Alzheimer's?

6
00:00:15.766 --> 00:00:17.966
No wonder the words are upside down

7
00:00:17.966 --> 00:00:20.400
How does Jiaojiao speak?

8
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.833
Sun daughter-in-law, they are all bad people

9
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.466
Don't be afraid with me.

10
00:00:27.733 --> 00:00:29.766
Madam, I am not your granddaughter-in-law

11
00:00:29.766 --> 00:00:31.666
Are you really mistaken?

12
00:00:31.666 --> 00:00:34.066
Impossible mom

13
00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:35.100
I get annoyed when I see him.

14
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.033
You can't fire him

15
00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:38.733
Jiang Yining has strong working ability

16
00:00:38.733 --> 00:00:39.466
Nothing wrong.

17
00:00:39.466 --> 00:00:40.900
How could I possibly fire him?

18
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.433
Jiaojiao, you are the future heir of Xu Shi

19
00:00:44.466 --> 00:00:46.300
You can't be loyal anymore

20
00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.000
Mr. Xu, I still have work to do

21
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.500
I'll be going out then.

22
00:00:57.333 --> 00:00:59.766
Mom, stop running around

23
00:00:59.766 --> 00:01:02.166
What is this housekeeper doing to eat people?

24
00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.366
Go back, I will definitely punish him.

25
00:01:04.533 --> 00:01:05.866
Jiang Yunning, right?

26
00:01:05.866 --> 00:01:07.500
I won't make you feel better

27
00:01:09.466 --> 00:01:11.133
This Miss Xu is really petty

28
00:01:11.133 --> 00:01:12.666
The fairy asked me to do two jobs

29
00:01:12.666 --> 00:01:14.900
If I hadn't saved money, I would have run away
