00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:05.666
Mom Yunting suddenly came to find us

2
00:00:05.666 --> 00:00:07.033
Is there something wrong?

3
00:00:07.333 --> 00:00:08.600
I don't know.

4
00:00:09.133 --> 00:00:11.766
No, my business was found out, right?

5
00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:16.666
Xiao Gu, what's the matter with you?

6
00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:19.200
It's about our collaboration

7
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.700
It's a personal matter.

8
00:00:27.166 --> 00:00:27.966
Lee

9
00:00:28.133 --> 00:00:30.700
Yi Ning's body is the same as Xu Jiao's

10
00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:32.300
Have cloud birthmarks

11
00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.033
Strangely enough

12
00:00:34.066 --> 00:00:36.266
He was suddenly kidnapped a few days ago

13
00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.566
Forced to use sulfuric acid

14
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.500
Back to birthmark

15
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.466
There is such a thing

16
00:00:42.533 --> 00:00:43.566
And Xu Dong

17
00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:46.600
Yi Ningke is also from Sunshine Orphanage

18
00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.300
What do you mean?

19
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.700
My suggestion is to get a DNA test

20
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:53.200
Will not

21
00:00:53.766 --> 00:00:54.700
Hello, Mom.

22
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.666
I just happened to hear from my colleague that

23
00:00:56.666 --> 00:00:58.500
Jiang Indonesia also has an imprint on his body

24
00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:59.666
It's very reassuring.

25
00:01:00.133 --> 00:01:01.866
Just take this opportunity

26
00:01:01.866 --> 00:01:03.966
Prove that I am your biological daughter

27
00:01:04.966 --> 00:01:08.433
Jiaojiao, you don't think too much, do you?

28
00:01:10.066 --> 00:01:10.866
All right

29
00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:12.600
OK

30
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.200
I'll take my leave then

31
00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.866
What? Dong Xu is my mother

32
00:01:23.466 --> 00:01:24.766
It's impossible.

33
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.900
You should think about it for the baby.

34
00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.566
Go get a DNA test

35
00:01:29.933 --> 00:01:32.500
Do you want to ask the baby in the future?

36
00:01:32.533 --> 00:01:34.766
Why does everyone else have grandparents and I don't?

37
00:01:34.966 --> 00:01:36.166
How do we explain this?

38
00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.100
Well, I can't take it away either.

39
00:01:39.333 --> 00:01:41.500
Babies have the rights of grandparents

40
00:01:41.866 --> 00:01:43.466
It's all up to you

41
00:01:47.933 --> 00:01:50.066
Mr. Gu's two DNA reports have just come out

42
00:01:50.066 --> 00:01:51.500
Please check it out.
