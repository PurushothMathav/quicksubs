00:00:05.733 --> 00:00:06.533
Mr. Gu

2
00:00:07.066 --> 00:00:10.700
Did I give you the wrong one?

3
00:00:14.933 --> 00:00:15.866
What do you think?

4
00:00:16.733 --> 00:00:19.800
I just said, I figured it out from a calculation

5
00:00:20.066 --> 00:00:20.866
Secretary Jiang

6
00:00:21.733 --> 00:00:23.600
It seems that you are not satisfied with your own alcohol intake

7
00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.666
There is no accurate understanding.

8
00:00:27.866 --> 00:00:28.700
Mr. Gu

9
00:00:28.966 --> 00:00:31.766
Can you see for the sake of me being drunk?

10
00:00:31.766 --> 00:00:33.200
Persuade me to open up

11
00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:34.366
I promise.

12
00:00:34.366 --> 00:00:36.900
I really have never known you

13
00:00:38.766 --> 00:00:39.833
What are you thinking?

14
00:00:40.466 --> 00:00:42.566
Your nightgown was changed by the waiter

15
00:00:43.266 --> 00:00:44.366
waiter

16
00:00:45.966 --> 00:00:48.966
Then last night you and I

17
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.100
Where will you sleep?

18
00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:52.500
Presidential Suite

19
00:00:52.666 --> 00:00:54.533
Can't you sleep alone?

20
00:00:54.533 --> 00:00:56.766
So nothing happened last night

21
00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:58.666
Scared me to death

22
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.666
I almost missed it just now

23
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:01.700
Right

24
00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.966
What did you mean by more than half a meal just now?

25
00:01:04.966 --> 00:01:08.266
Am I scolding me for not having a long memory and being greedy for cups?

26
00:01:08.266 --> 00:01:09.366
Mr. Gu, don't worry.

27
00:01:09.366 --> 00:01:11.933
I will definitely exercise my alcohol intake when I go back this time.

28
00:01:11.933 --> 00:01:12.866
Definitely next time.

29
00:01:12.866 --> 00:01:14.766
Buddha blocking killing Buddha god blocking killing

30
00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.033
Ah, wrong.

31
00:01:17.733 --> 00:01:19.800
Did he find something?

32
00:01:25.866 --> 00:01:27.566
Your bangs are fake

33
00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.000
What are you pretending to be?

34
00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:40.766
When I was in school, I was targeted for my appearance

35
00:01:41.166 --> 00:01:42.533
This is acceptable

36
00:01:42.533 --> 00:01:45.233
Many troublesome people's looks are given by their parents

37
00:01:45.533 --> 00:01:47.800
You don't have to feel wronged by those rotten people

38
00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:49.366
I was born with this identity.

39
00:01:49.366 --> 00:01:50.866
If you want to pay attention to those criticisms

40
00:01:50.866 --> 00:01:52.800
The story couldn't have been what it is now

41
00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:54.000
World-class consortium

42
00:01:54.133 --> 00:01:55.533
Be my secretary to Gu Yunting

43
00:01:55.533 --> 00:01:57.400
Keep your head up and be a man in the future

44
00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:59.266
It's Mr. Gu

45
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.233
Put things here

46
00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:15.100
It's a beard.

47
00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:38.766
On his neck
