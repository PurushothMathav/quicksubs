00:00:02.366 --> 00:00:04.266
Oh, Nini!

2
00:00:04.266 --> 00:00:05.266
Why are you here?

3
00:00:05.266 --> 00:00:06.933
You rarely get off work on time today.

4
00:00:06.933 --> 00:00:08.766
Shall we ask Xiao Xiao to have dinner together?

5
00:00:08.766 --> 00:00:10.566
They all grew up in an orphanage

6
00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:12.566
We need more bonding.

7
00:00:12.566 --> 00:00:15.500
Okay, wait for me to call Xiao Xiao

8
00:00:16.466 --> 00:00:19.133
Exactly. He recently got a new boyfriend.

9
00:00:19.133 --> 00:00:20.266
Let's go to Tapoma Pass

10
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.300
This person is Wen Wenfu of Secretary Jiang

11
00:00:24.133 --> 00:00:25.666
They look happy.

12
00:00:25.866 --> 00:00:27.100
It should be a good night.

13
00:00:32.466 --> 00:00:34.633
Ah, sorry, let me take a call first

14
00:00:35.066 --> 00:00:35.600
like this

15
00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.500
Come to the closet with me tonight and have a dream

16
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:39.300
Oh.

17
00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.266
Yo here comes Tingting

18
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.366
The sun is out in the west today

19
00:00:47.366 --> 00:00:48.900
I have known you for so many years

20
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.633
You like this

21
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.233
You're going down a cliff.

22
00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.233
He is my childhood, not

23
00:01:01.366 --> 00:01:02.100
Liang Shao

24
00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.766
First of all, let me state that I am not Mr. Gu's woman

25
00:01:04.766 --> 00:01:06.566
I am Mr. Gu's secretary

26
00:01:06.566 --> 00:01:08.766
Secondly, what about your eyes?

27
00:01:08.766 --> 00:01:10.266
You don't like vases.

28
00:01:10.266 --> 00:01:12.766
You think that because in your worldview

29
00:01:12.766 --> 00:01:14.300
Only judge people by their appearance

30
00:01:14.666 --> 00:01:17.300
You and Mr. Gu are really at the top of the cloud

31
00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.300
Yunting, your subordinate is so articulate

32
00:01:23.566 --> 00:01:25.033
I'm speechless

33
00:01:25.333 --> 00:01:26.933
Are you going to perform well today?

34
00:01:26.933 --> 00:01:28.600
Otherwise I won't wander easily

35
00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:41.600
Hey wait a minute

36
00:01:42.133 --> 00:01:44.400
I will drink this cup for Mr. Gu

37
00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:51.800
refreshing

38
00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:55.466
Have another drink

39
00:02:11.066 --> 00:02:12.633
It's over. It's over.

40
00:02:13.266 --> 00:02:15.700
I won't sleep with Mr. Gu, will I?
