00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:07.666
Nini, I know you don't believe me right now

2
00:00:07.666 --> 00:00:10.400
But I'll show you my heart

3
00:00:12.266 --> 00:00:13.100
Let's go

4
00:00:16.766 --> 00:00:17.900
Sure enough, Mr. Ba

5
00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:20.433
Looking at me, I'm still a little moved

6
00:00:22.733 --> 00:00:24.966
Shall I ask about the engagement?

7
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:26.766
Maybe there is a misunderstanding.

8
00:00:30.466 --> 00:00:32.800
How is the monitoring recovery of Langting Club?

9
00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.833
50% restored

10
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.566
After recovery

11
00:00:36.566 --> 00:00:39.633
Find that woman and go to bed

12
00:00:42.666 --> 00:00:43.600
solve

13
00:00:44.066 --> 00:00:46.466
Gu Yunting really won't let me and my child go

14
00:00:46.866 --> 00:00:50.266
No, I have to run away when I make enough money

15
00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.866
Jiaojiao, if I hadn't taken care of this for you today

16
00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:59.233
My aunt must know it was you who did it

17
00:00:59.366 --> 00:01:02.033
You can't be so willful in the future

18
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.433
I just hate Jiang Yining

19
00:01:04.533 --> 00:01:06.433
Mom, get him away

20
00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.366
Jiang Yining, what's wrong with you?

21
00:01:08.366 --> 00:01:10.233
He's fine. He's a kid.

22
00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.033
Since you like Jiang Yun so much

23
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.633
Then you can let Jiang Yun be your daughter

24
00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:16.400
I'm going to take this birthmark home right now.

25
00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.533
What are you doing back at the orphanage?

26
00:01:18.533 --> 00:01:20.433
I grew up in an orphanage anyway

27
00:01:20.533 --> 00:01:21.966
No mother loves me anymore

28
00:01:21.966 --> 00:01:24.033
What are you doing?

29
00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:28.700
please

30
00:01:29.266 --> 00:01:33.100
I'm sorry to make you lose the steamed bread once.

31
00:01:33.466 --> 00:01:35.700
Never again

32
00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:39.966
Then marry you

33
00:01:40.166 --> 00:01:43.200
I'll send him to the branch later.

34
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.366
How nice of you!

35
00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.300
You're about to get engaged

36
00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.200
Never let the story know your little moves
