1
00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:03.266
This is my baby.

2
00:00:03.266 --> 00:00:05.700
The child must belong to the family

3
00:00:06.133 --> 00:00:09.633
It's impossible for you to suffer outside with your children

4
00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:11.200
This agreement

5
00:00:11.666 --> 00:00:13.100
Sign it now

6
00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:18.900
Tingting

7
00:00:19.933 --> 00:00:22.300
Why did the agreement die?

8
00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.433
It was because of your control in the first place

9
00:00:24.933 --> 00:00:27.666
Will push the woman I love far away

10
00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:30.100
Now if you step in again

11
00:00:30.533 --> 00:00:32.233
Neither mother nor son have to do it

12
00:00:32.266 --> 00:00:35.033
Let's talk about it first, and that strong one has bad intentions

13
00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.700
Jiang Yining is the same

14
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.833
Why don't you understand?

15
00:00:41.566 --> 00:00:43.600
Ok ok

16
00:00:46.566 --> 00:00:47.666
Whatever.

17
00:00:50.933 --> 00:00:51.900
original

18
00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:55.500
Your lotus leaf double lotus was torn apart by your mother

19
00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.500
It's really a bunch of hard-working mandarin ducks

20
00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:59.566
Now I can't compare

21
00:00:59.666 --> 00:01:01.366
Her place in your heart

22
00:01:03.933 --> 00:01:04.733
one year

23
00:01:05.266 --> 00:01:06.766
Don't be angry

24
00:01:07.733 --> 00:01:09.766
But your mother did remind me

25
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.900
We do owe a debt of gratitude.

26
00:01:12.966 --> 00:01:15.600
After the child is born, it will be surnamed Jiang with me

27
00:01:15.966 --> 00:01:16.400
Gu Family

28
00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.700
You can't argue with me for child support at any time

29
00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:19.500
right

30
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.033
You can go back now.

31
00:01:31.566 --> 00:01:32.366
Definitely

32
00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.100
What happened between you and your daughter?

33
00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.500
Why did you suddenly move out of here?

34
00:01:37.533 --> 00:01:39.233
I completely forgot about him

35
00:01:40.266 --> 00:01:41.700
He and his first love, water

36
00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.166
Is there any misunderstanding about this?

37
00:01:44.166 --> 00:01:45.666
Even if it is a misunderstanding

38
00:01:45.966 --> 00:01:47.933
But he gave up so easily

39
00:01:47.933 --> 00:01:51.000
Show that his love is like that, I don't need him

40
00:01:51.733 --> 00:01:53.066
It's enough for me to have kids
