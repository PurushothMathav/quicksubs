00:00:01.533 --> 00:00:02.566
Ouch Chu Chu

2
00:00:02.866 --> 00:00:05.166
Even if you don't come to me, I will come to you

3
00:00:05.266 --> 00:00:07.433
What's the matter, Omori can't say a word?

4
00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:10.433
Did something happen to Su Wanjing?

5
00:00:10.533 --> 00:00:11.666
How do you know that?

6
00:00:12.933 --> 00:00:15.633
Have I lived in your house for that long after all?

7
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.366
There are some things I know a little bit about

8
00:00:18.666 --> 00:00:19.466
Yeah.

9
00:00:19.966 --> 00:00:22.400
Well, it doesn't matter, Chu Chu

10
00:00:22.533 --> 00:00:24.166
I understand you

11
00:00:24.966 --> 00:00:27.200
Really, Omori, you understand me too well, right?

12
00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.533
Buy gold coins and kidnap

13
00:00:28.533 --> 00:00:30.833
It seems that nine times out of ten, it has nothing to do with him

14
00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.133
Chu Chu

15
00:00:33.133 --> 00:00:35.300
In fact, the person I like has always been you

16
00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.266
Really, Omori?

17
00:00:37.333 --> 00:00:38.533
That Su Wanqing?

18
00:00:38.533 --> 00:00:40.300
Since becoming a company secretary

19
00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:41.966
You fiddled with the finances.

20
00:00:42.166 --> 00:00:43.766
I want to transfer the company's funds

21
00:00:43.766 --> 00:00:45.233
I discovered it early on

22
00:00:45.333 --> 00:00:46.566
But to stabilize him

23
00:00:46.566 --> 00:00:47.900
I really can't help it.

24
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.966
That's why I pretended to kick you out

25
00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:51.233
Sorry Chu Chu

26
00:00:51.866 --> 00:00:53.633
I also want to be more realistic

27
00:00:53.933 --> 00:00:55.466
So I never told you.

28
00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:56.400
Omori

29
00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.000
I almost thought you didn't want me anymore. How could it be?

30
00:00:59.466 --> 00:00:59.966
But now

31
00:00:59.966 --> 00:01:00.900
I have mastered Su Wan

32
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:02.366
Clear all the evidence of the crime

33
00:01:02.466 --> 00:01:03.833
I'm going to take him to the police station

34
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.366
But he seems to have known in advance

35
00:01:06.366 --> 00:01:08.066
It seems that he is going to run away early.

36
00:01:08.666 --> 00:01:11.500
He also directed and starred in a kidnapping scene

37
00:01:11.533 --> 00:01:13.100
He opened his mouth for 50 million

38
00:01:13.166 --> 00:01:15.066
Hmph, is it really a lion?

39
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.200
Brother Omori, don't be angry

40
00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:18.300
I have a way

41
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:19.500
Do you really have a way?

42
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.966
Chu Chu, I tied him up, really?
