00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:02.666
Auntie, you are amazing

2
00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.200
Made so much delicious in less than an hour

3
00:00:05.333 --> 00:00:07.200
Little girl, you are also amazing

4
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.866
So talkative

5
00:00:08.966 --> 00:00:11.900
Auntie, what kind of work do you usually do?

6
00:00:12.166 --> 00:00:13.900
I haven't heard Chu Chu say it before

7
00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:17.066
I usually do crafts

8
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:18.966
Although I don't earn much

9
00:00:18.966 --> 00:00:20.966
But solid

10
00:00:22.133 --> 00:00:23.700
Auntie, you have worked hard

11
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:26.900
Nothing, little girl, where are your parents?

12
00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.100
My parents are dead, girl

13
00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:31.166
Sorry, sorry.

14
00:00:31.166 --> 00:00:32.566
I didn't mean to.

15
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.100
It's okay. It's okay.

16
00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:35.266
What are you sorry for?

17
00:00:35.366 --> 00:00:37.666
Secretary Su, you won't bully Auntie, will you?

18
00:00:37.666 --> 00:00:39.666
Mom, is this woman bullying you?

19
00:00:39.666 --> 00:00:41.966
You tell me, I'll ask the junior to call it.

20
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.400
Okay, okay, okay, okay

21
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.033
Let's all sit down and eat

22
00:00:48.533 --> 00:00:51.600
That Miss Su looks very nice

23
00:00:52.333 --> 00:00:54.200
I think you are a good man, right?

24
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:55.366
He is Da Sun's secretary

25
00:00:55.366 --> 00:00:57.000
Look for opportunities to rise at any time

26
00:00:57.133 --> 00:01:00.033
I'm not going to give him this chance, am I?

27
00:01:01.766 --> 00:01:02.966
Believe it or not?

28
00:01:02.966 --> 00:01:04.066
One day he has not yet succeeded

29
00:01:04.066 --> 00:01:05.266
Kicked us both out

30
00:01:05.266 --> 00:01:06.133
Some of you cry

31
00:01:06.133 --> 00:01:07.533
Chu Chu, don't misunderstand

32
00:01:07.533 --> 00:01:08.866
That's not what I meant.

33
00:01:08.866 --> 00:01:11.266
My heart must be towards you

34
00:01:11.266 --> 00:01:12.100
Don't say another word.

35
00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:13.000
I don't want to hear it.

36
00:01:13.133 --> 00:01:13.966
I'm going out.

37
00:01:13.966 --> 00:01:15.166
You need to find someone
