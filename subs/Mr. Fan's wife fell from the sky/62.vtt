00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.166
You have no family

2
00:00:02.166 --> 00:00:03.966
Why destroy someone else's family?

3
00:00:03.966 --> 00:00:05.466
Now there are rumors out there

4
00:00:05.666 --> 00:00:07.766
Of course I have to prove my innocence before leaving

5
00:00:07.766 --> 00:00:09.266
You're not innocent, are you?

6
00:00:09.733 --> 00:00:11.400
Ok I tell you

7
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.133
Actually, I took those pictures.

8
00:00:13.133 --> 00:00:14.900
I just want you to leave the Fan family

9
00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:17.033
Don't ruin my daughter's happiness again

10
00:00:18.966 --> 00:00:21.633
Now that you know, you can go.

11
00:00:22.866 --> 00:00:24.200
Don't come back.

12
00:00:29.566 --> 00:00:30.700
Chu Chu Chu

13
00:00:31.266 --> 00:00:33.766
I didn't expect you to not only hook up with Wang Zitao

14
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.900
He and Mr. Chen colluded

15
00:00:36.366 --> 00:00:38.100
I really misjudged you.

16
00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:40.333
You don't go

17
00:00:40.333 --> 00:00:41.200
You don't go

18
00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:42.700
I'm not finished yet.

19
00:00:43.366 --> 00:00:44.433
Not Omori

20
00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:46.400
It doesn't work like that.

21
00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.133
Just because I love you so much

22
00:00:48.133 --> 00:00:50.000
Oh, stop lying.

23
00:00:50.133 --> 00:00:51.700
If you really love Omori

24
00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:53.366
You wouldn't be unable to see it now

25
00:00:53.366 --> 00:00:54.800
I'm not your van Dasen

26
00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:56.666
What!

27
00:00:57.933 --> 00:00:59.900
I said I'm not your van Dasen

28
00:01:00.266 --> 00:01:02.166
I know you hate me now

29
00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.200
But you don't have to say that, do you?

30
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:06.300
If you're not Van Dasen, who is?

31
00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:07.900
You are my Van Dasen

32
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.500
You just don't love me anymore, do you?

33
00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.866
Oh no, hey.

34
00:01:13.666 --> 00:01:14.600
How come?

35
00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:16.800
I can't help hitting people.

36
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.000
Sorry.

37
00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:20.833
Chu Chu, why are you doing this?

38
00:01:20.966 --> 00:01:23.266
I don't understand what you're saying

39
00:01:23.866 --> 00:01:25.133
Don't hide from everyone around

40
00:01:25.133 --> 00:01:26.200
Come out
