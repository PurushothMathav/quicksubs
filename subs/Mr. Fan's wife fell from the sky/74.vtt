00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:01.466
Be honest

2
00:00:03.366 --> 00:00:04.600
Who are you?

3
00:00:05.533 --> 00:00:06.700
Hungry?

4
00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:10.966
Bah, the little girl has quite a backbone

5
00:00:11.266 --> 00:00:14.166
Since you have so much backbone, don't eat today's meal

6
00:00:14.166 --> 00:00:15.466
Who sent you?

7
00:00:22.466 --> 00:00:24.666
Huzi, don't sleep

8
00:00:24.966 --> 00:00:26.466
He Xiaoni is watching me closely

9
00:00:26.466 --> 00:00:28.033
Give him food when he's hungry

10
00:00:28.133 --> 00:00:29.700
I'll go to Tao Zi's later.

11
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.433
Come drink water

12
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.966
Hey, you're a tough girl

13
00:00:42.166 --> 00:00:43.800
If you weren't worth 50 million

14
00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.566
I won't bring you tea and water

15
00:00:45.566 --> 00:00:47.566
Boy, let me do it

16
00:00:49.333 --> 00:00:50.466
Take it to buy cigarettes

17
00:00:50.933 --> 00:00:53.400
Haha, okay.

18
00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.900
Then you still can't believe me, hahaha.

19
00:01:11.333 --> 00:01:13.766
Su Wanqing, you don't have to rush to doubt

20
00:01:14.166 --> 00:01:17.166
Omori told me, stop pretending

21
00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:18.366
I have to admit.

22
00:01:18.366 --> 00:01:20.266
Your tactics are really clever

23
00:01:20.466 --> 00:01:22.766
But you still don't want to talk about it.

24
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.366
Although I don't know what medicine you sell in the gourd

25
00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.000
But time is running out.

26
00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:28.200
Su Wanqing, you

27
00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.800
Okay, Omori is waiting for you at the alley

28
00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.366
Su Wanqing, just wait for jail
