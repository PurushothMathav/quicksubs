00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.166
Sorry.

2
00:00:08.666 --> 00:00:10.600
You apologize every time you do something wrong

3
00:00:10.666 --> 00:00:12.433
If it weren't for my body

4
00:00:12.966 --> 00:00:13.800
Neither will you.

5
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:15.300
I wouldn't know.

6
00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.200
The person you have always missed

7
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:18.600
Just a bubble of love

8
00:00:18.766 --> 00:00:20.800
Uh, it's nothing really. Hmm

9
00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:22.700
Have you ever done it all over again?

10
00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:25.500
It's like I'm always talking about myself

11
00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.000
What about yours? What can I say?

12
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:28.933
Can you let me know?

13
00:00:28.933 --> 00:00:31.000
In fact, I grew up in an orphanage

14
00:00:31.866 --> 00:00:33.600
My parents have been gone since I was a child

15
00:00:34.066 --> 00:00:35.533
Relatives and friends don't want me anymore

16
00:00:35.533 --> 00:00:36.766
So I grew up knowing

17
00:00:36.766 --> 00:00:38.400
People need to live in this world

18
00:00:38.733 --> 00:00:39.866
You're on your own.

19
00:00:39.933 --> 00:00:43.433
And then? And then I'm all alone?

20
00:00:43.533 --> 00:00:45.866
Sometimes it can be a little unhappy to be bullied.

21
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.500
But come to think of it, it was nothing.

22
00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.200
Why didn't you tell me this?

23
00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:51.833
Who would have nothing to say about this?

24
00:00:51.933 --> 00:00:54.500
Then what's the matter with you and that Wang Zitao?

25
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.300
He helped me when I was down and confused

26
00:00:58.733 --> 00:01:01.100
Because no one has ever been so kind to me?

27
00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.400
I thought he was my prince on a white horse

28
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.900
Hmm but I didn't expect

29
00:01:07.066 --> 00:01:09.000
He is the prince charming of many people

30
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.866
This prince is not only fucking deceiving

31
00:01:11.866 --> 00:01:12.933
He cheated people out of money.

32
00:01:12.933 --> 00:01:15.100
He, get ready

33
00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.266
I'm going to accompany my friend Mr. Chen tonight

34
00:01:17.266 --> 00:01:18.300
Why is that?

35
00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:19.866
I'm your girlfriend.

36
00:01:20.366 --> 00:01:23.300
Why are you going to accompany that 60-year-old man?

37
00:01:25.533 --> 00:01:27.600
Over 60 is not old

38
00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:29.866
And it's just for one night.
