00:00:01.066 --> 00:00:02.300
The young master has sent someone

2
00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:04.166
I have searched all the places where Miss Wanqing often goes

3
00:00:04.166 --> 00:00:05.200
Still no one found.

4
00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:06.600
What do you eat?

5
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.000
Hey, I can't find it after searching for so long.

6
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.366
Now I can only call the police.

7
00:00:10.766 --> 00:00:12.133
This is absolutely not possible.

8
00:00:12.133 --> 00:00:13.533
Call the police in case the cup tears the ticket by then

9
00:00:13.533 --> 00:00:15.333
I can't find Miss Wanqing

10
00:00:15.333 --> 00:00:16.700
You can't wait at home for three days.

11
00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:18.100
Then send money to the robber

12
00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:20.000
What if something happens during this period?

13
00:00:20.133 --> 00:00:22.300
Why don't we investigate it ourselves first?

14
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.233
Chu Chu

15
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.666
Hey Chuchu

16
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:28.366
What are you working on now?

17
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.766
I'm not feeling well.

18
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.666
I know you don't like me now

19
00:00:32.666 --> 00:00:33.800
But you have to trust me.

20
00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.833
My heart for you has never changed

21
00:00:36.266 --> 00:00:37.500
Goodbye one last time

22
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:38.700
Where are you now?

23
00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:41.166
I'm in my old place

24
00:00:41.166 --> 00:00:42.400
I'm coming to you now.

25
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.466
Grandma doesn't know yet

26
00:00:44.466 --> 00:00:45.400
Don't worry, young master

27
00:00:45.533 --> 00:00:47.300
Grandma, the news was blocked that day.

28
00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.900
That's good, grandma is too old to get in and out of school

29
00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:51.400
understand
