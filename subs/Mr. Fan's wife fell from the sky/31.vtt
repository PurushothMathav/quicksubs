00:00:04.533 --> 00:00:06.533
Let me help you, oh Omori

2
00:00:06.533 --> 00:00:07.166
This kind of thing

3
00:00:07.166 --> 00:00:08.933
Just leave it to his servant to do it.

4
00:00:08.933 --> 00:00:11.600
What are you worrying about? Oh, it's nothing.

5
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:13.133
Yes ma'am is right

6
00:00:13.133 --> 00:00:14.600
This is what I should do.

7
00:00:15.333 --> 00:00:16.500
Gone

8
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.000
Mr. Fan, welcome home

9
00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.300
Chu Chu, you will sleep in this one in the future.

10
00:00:32.166 --> 00:00:34.866
Ah, it's not my senior year, don't I live with you?

11
00:00:34.866 --> 00:00:36.966
Grandma is a person with outdated ideas

12
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.566
It's better to wait until you get married before living

13
00:00:40.566 --> 00:00:42.500
Oh, old man, be considerate.

14
00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:44.566
I am the only elder.

15
00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:47.000
I'm sure I'll listen to grandma's words

16
00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:48.666
All right.

17
00:00:48.666 --> 00:00:51.433
Assistant Su, take Miss Chu Chu's suitcase.

18
00:00:51.666 --> 00:00:54.966
Okay, actually got engaged and got married soon

19
00:00:54.966 --> 00:00:57.466
Well, bye-bye. Well, bye-bye.

20
00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.066
What are you doing ma'am give you chocolate

21
00:01:05.133 --> 00:01:07.166
I stopped eating this chocolate a long time ago

22
00:01:07.166 --> 00:01:08.933
But this is not when you were in college

23
00:01:08.933 --> 00:01:10.200
Favorite chocolate?

24
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.333
Who told you that?

25
00:01:11.333 --> 00:01:12.400
Take it away

26
00:01:12.566 --> 00:01:12.866
This

27
00:01:12.866 --> 00:01:15.200
You are too embarrassed to grow low-grade chocolate and bring it to me.

28
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.000
Humph

29
00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.366
Ah, wow.

30
00:01:24.366 --> 00:01:25.966
Is this the chocolate from last time?

31
00:01:26.066 --> 00:01:27.400
I remember it was delicious.

32
00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:28.866
Can I have one?

33
00:01:29.333 --> 00:01:32.266
It's all for you. What's wrong with you? You're so depressed.

34
00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:33.700
