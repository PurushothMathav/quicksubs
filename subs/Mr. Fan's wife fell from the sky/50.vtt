00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:02.233
When I married him

2
00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:04.033
I'll kick you out sooner or later

3
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:08.300
Ah!

4
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.800
Hey, what's the matter, Chu Chu's senior year?

5
00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:13.833
He pushed me, you have to call the shots with me

6
00:00:15.133 --> 00:00:17.000
The pain is killing me. Finish the gun

7
00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:18.900
How dare you push Chu Chu

8
00:00:19.133 --> 00:00:21.000
The future wife of the Fan Group

9
00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.900
Now suspend all your duties in the company

10
00:00:23.966 --> 00:00:25.066
Pack up quickly

11
00:00:29.933 --> 00:00:31.466
Ah, it hurts.

12
00:00:32.133 --> 00:00:32.933
Humph

13
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.400
What did you mean just now?

14
00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.700
If I don't say that, will Chu Chu let you go?

15
00:00:38.866 --> 00:00:40.666
If you don't say that, I have a way

16
00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.766
Look how you beat people like this

17
00:00:44.566 --> 00:00:45.500
Excuse me.

18
00:00:46.133 --> 00:00:48.033
I forgot to throw my body away

19
00:00:48.166 --> 00:00:49.533
And do you run if you can't beat it?

20
00:00:49.533 --> 00:00:50.733
What do you care about with him?

21
00:00:50.733 --> 00:00:52.966
He says he loves you while touching you

22
00:00:53.133 --> 00:00:54.033
I couldn't help myself.

23
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:55.900
If it were before

24
00:00:56.366 --> 00:00:57.966
I will still believe him

25
00:00:57.966 --> 00:00:59.333
Do you know what love is?

26
00:00:59.333 --> 00:01:01.400
Do you understand? If you do

27
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.733
Will not

28
00:01:01.733 --> 00:01:03.366
Now I can see the true face of that woman

29
00:01:03.366 --> 00:01:05.033
Enough hum

30
00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.566
We should be quiet now and work together

31
00:01:08.866 --> 00:01:11.166
Find out what social connections Chu Chu has now

32
00:01:11.266 --> 00:01:13.266
Which upper-class people are involved?

33
00:01:13.566 --> 00:01:14.133
To know

34
00:01:14.133 --> 00:01:16.100
What high society people is he related to?

35
00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:17.600
I have an idea.

36
00:01:18.466 --> 00:01:20.766
Hold a salon party in the name of Chu Chu

37
00:01:20.933 --> 00:01:22.666
Just line it up one by one.

38
00:01:22.666 --> 00:01:24.233
Hmm, then I fell asleep

39
00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:25.466
Not allowed to go

40
00:01:26.333 --> 00:01:28.233
You are not familiar with the company's business process

41
00:01:28.333 --> 00:01:31.166
And I have to check all kinds of hidden dangers one by one

42
00:01:31.366 --> 00:01:32.366
Get off work together

43
00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:33.966
Peel the skin around

44
00:01:34.133 --> 00:01:35.600
You're going to kill me
