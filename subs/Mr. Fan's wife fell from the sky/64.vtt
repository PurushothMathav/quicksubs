00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.700
Wow, why did it come out?

2
00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.100
Haven't you fixed it yet?

3
00:00:04.333 --> 00:00:05.666
What the hell is going on?

4
00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.766
The group president actually cancelled the engagement

5
00:00:08.366 --> 00:00:09.433
As long as he wants

6
00:00:09.666 --> 00:00:11.400
Then I will also stand with him

7
00:00:12.366 --> 00:00:13.700
Because we can't be apart

8
00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:16.366
Mr. Fan, are you empathizing?

9
00:00:16.366 --> 00:00:17.900
Or pedal on a few boats?

10
00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:19.900
So you and your secretary are true love

11
00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:21.700
Then why did you want to talk to Chu Chu in the first place?

12
00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:22.866
Lady is engaged

13
00:00:22.866 --> 00:00:24.666
Well, anyway.

14
00:00:24.733 --> 00:00:26.200
That's it for today.

15
00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:27.500
Please leave my house

16
00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:29.433
Trespassing

17
00:00:29.666 --> 00:00:31.433
Aren't you afraid of a lawsuit?

18
00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:32.900
Oh, Mr. Fan

19
00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:33.966
We're leaving. We're leaving.

20
00:00:33.966 --> 00:00:35.800
Let's go, you go too

21
00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.866
I don't want to see your butler send them away again

22
00:00:38.866 --> 00:00:41.200
It's a pig

23
00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:45.600
Hey

24
00:00:46.066 --> 00:00:48.500
Are we going too far today?

25
00:00:48.566 --> 00:00:49.633
Will not

26
00:00:50.466 --> 00:00:52.966
I won't let anyone have the opportunity to hurt you

27
00:00:52.966 --> 00:00:53.766
Humph

28
00:00:54.166 --> 00:00:55.300
Humph

29
00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:56.933
Ha ha.

30
00:00:56.933 --> 00:00:59.566
If you find that you are not welcome, you will get out of here immediately.

31
00:01:02.166 --> 00:01:03.400
That bitch

32
00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:05.333
I will never let him win

33
00:01:05.333 --> 00:01:06.600
Wait for me.

34
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.400
It's all my fault for not getting things done

35
00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.366
Of course it's your fault.

36
00:01:12.366 --> 00:01:14.300
Blame you, blame you

37
00:01:14.866 --> 00:01:16.300
What do you want mom to do?

38
00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:18.466
You don't blame mom for what she does

39
00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:19.766
What do I need you to do?

40
00:01:19.766 --> 00:01:21.466
I want you to kill him. Do you dare?

41
00:01:21.466 --> 00:01:23.666
Do you dare? Don't you dare?

42
00:01:23.666 --> 00:01:26.633
I can only rely on myself I can't rely on anyone else
