00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:00.966
What!

2
00:00:02.566 --> 00:00:04.000
Oops, no more.

3
00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:06.500
Really leave me one.

4
00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:09.100
Gone

5
00:00:09.933 --> 00:00:12.266
Hello Mr. Fan

6
00:00:12.266 --> 00:00:13.400
Hello. Hello.

7
00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:14.666
Uh, let me introduce you to everyone

8
00:00:14.666 --> 00:00:15.766
How about this guy standing next to me?

9
00:00:15.766 --> 00:00:18.633
It is Su Wanqing, the new company president secretary

10
00:00:18.766 --> 00:00:20.266
Applause and welcome

11
00:00:22.966 --> 00:00:25.366
Then let Secretary Su introduce himself

12
00:00:25.866 --> 00:00:27.566
Hello, my name is Su Wanqing.

13
00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:29.366
Now Mr. Fan's secretary

14
00:00:29.366 --> 00:00:31.700
What do you need to connect with Mr. Fan?

15
00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:33.266
You can contact me directly.

16
00:00:33.266 --> 00:00:34.833
Yes, yes, find him

17
00:00:34.933 --> 00:00:35.733
Mr. Fan

18
00:00:35.733 --> 00:00:37.900
The company mentioned to you about recruiting a secretary before.

19
00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:39.700
But you have always disagreed?

20
00:00:39.733 --> 00:00:42.700
No matter how big or small the company is, you do it yourself

21
00:00:42.733 --> 00:00:44.466
What happens now?

22
00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.500
Before

23
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.066
I feel like I can handle everything else

24
00:00:49.066 --> 00:00:51.200
But then I thought it was too tiring to be alone

25
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.666
I will ask Secretary Su to help me share the burden.

26
00:00:53.666 --> 00:00:54.700
Secretary Nasu

27
00:00:54.733 --> 00:00:57.066
You must live up to our expectations, Mr. Fan

28
00:00:57.066 --> 00:00:58.633
Haha, yes, yes.

29
00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.200
All right, let's get to work.

30
00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:03.133
Okay, okay.

31
00:01:03.133 --> 00:01:04.966
Mr. Chen, wait a minute

32
00:01:05.333 --> 00:01:07.866
Because I need to work for Mr. Fan now

33
00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:10.400
So please trouble various departments in half an hour

34
00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.666
The work content responsible for the past six months

35
00:01:12.666 --> 00:01:13.666
Hand it over to Mr. Fan's office

36
00:01:13.666 --> 00:01:15.000
What are you doing?

37
00:01:15.666 --> 00:01:18.266
The secretary came in slippers today, right?

38
00:01:18.666 --> 00:01:20.800
Everyone cooperates with Secretary Su's work

39
00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.566
Except for me in the company

40
00:01:22.566 --> 00:01:24.900
Just listen to Secretary Su for other big and small things

41
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.433
Does Mr. Fan have anything else to explain?

42
00:01:27.466 --> 00:01:30.200
Well, it should be out of stock for the time being, right?

43
00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.266
Then let's work hard, eh?
