00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:01.900
Mr. Fan

2
00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:04.700
This is the information of various departments of the company for half a year

3
00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:06.533
I brought it to you. Okay.

4
00:00:06.533 --> 00:00:09.100
Just put it here. Wow.

5
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.200
You are so tall

6
00:00:12.366 --> 00:00:14.266
Thicker than my head

7
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.666
Your skin is so good, right?

8
00:00:16.666 --> 00:00:18.300
What makeup do you usually use?

9
00:00:19.266 --> 00:00:20.500
Mr. Fan

10
00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:24.033
Why didn't I find out earlier that you are still good?

11
00:00:24.133 --> 00:00:26.566
It's a shame you work here.

12
00:00:26.733 --> 00:00:28.233
You are in such a good shape.

13
00:00:29.066 --> 00:00:31.466
I used to envy those who were models

14
00:00:31.466 --> 00:00:33.500
But I never had a chance

15
00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:34.800
Look at you

16
00:00:34.866 --> 00:00:36.666
So tall and so fit

17
00:00:36.666 --> 00:00:37.766
The waist is so thin

18
00:00:37.766 --> 00:00:39.433
Well, Mr. Fan

19
00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.400
Am I beautiful?

20
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.266
Am I more beautiful than Secretary Su?

21
00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:44.800
How is that comparable?

22
00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:45.700
Humph

23
00:00:46.666 --> 00:00:47.333
Humph

24
00:00:47.333 --> 00:00:50.900
Su Mi's scholar is a sinking fish and falling geese

25
00:00:50.966 --> 00:00:54.100
No one in the world is more beautiful than him

26
00:00:54.733 --> 00:00:56.500
What's wrong, Mr. Fan?

27
00:00:56.533 --> 00:00:58.466
It's nothing, I'm going out first

28
00:00:59.166 --> 00:00:59.966
Ah!

29
00:01:02.466 --> 00:01:03.866
What's wrong with this employee?

30
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:05.600
weird

31
00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.266
You still want to compete with me
