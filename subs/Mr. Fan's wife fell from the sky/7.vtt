Hello grandma

2
00:00:03.133 --> 00:00:05.266
Junior year, you know

3
00:00:05.266 --> 00:00:08.400
Why is grandma here these days?

4
00:00:11.666 --> 00:00:12.466
know

5
00:00:12.933 --> 00:00:14.800
Grandma, aren't I getting engaged tomorrow?

6
00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:17.666
Now that you know you're getting engaged tomorrow

7
00:00:17.666 --> 00:00:20.766
Why did you bring the other Muses to live there?

8
00:00:23.866 --> 00:00:26.266
Talk like this

9
00:00:26.266 --> 00:00:28.166
Because Mr. Fan is busy

10
00:00:28.166 --> 00:00:30.033
So he sent me to assist his grandmother

11
00:00:30.166 --> 00:00:31.766
Ouch, you don't know

12
00:00:31.766 --> 00:00:33.966
There's been a lot going on in the company recently.

13
00:00:35.566 --> 00:00:36.833
I just can't help it.

14
00:00:36.866 --> 00:00:38.366
Cheng He Style

15
00:00:38.366 --> 00:00:40.000
You are not young anymore

16
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.733
You are getting engaged tomorrow

17
00:00:41.733 --> 00:00:45.066
You brought other women in today?

18
00:00:45.333 --> 00:00:47.433
If you let others know

19
00:00:47.466 --> 00:00:49.000
How do people see you?

20
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.666
How can you be worthy of our fan?

21
00:00:50.666 --> 00:00:53.166
The name accumulated over the years

22
00:00:53.166 --> 00:00:56.800
How can you be worthy of your father and mother?

23
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:00.666
Sorry grandma

24
00:01:00.666 --> 00:01:02.866
I was wrong hahaha

25
00:01:02.866 --> 00:01:06.300
Ouch, why are you still crying?

26
00:01:07.466 --> 00:01:09.100
Oh you

27
00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:10.900
When you were a child

28
00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:14.166
Your parents sent you to live outside

29
00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.200
Actually

30
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.300
Just to let you know the vicissitudes of this world

31
00:01:19.133 --> 00:01:20.366
Let's talk about it.

32
00:01:20.366 --> 00:01:21.900
Although a little wrong

33
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.433
But this parent loves his son deeply

34
00:01:26.566 --> 00:01:28.833
Don't blame them.

35
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.100
Grandma also knows

36
00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:32.700
You've been alone all these years

37
00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.933
I also hope that someone can come to accompany you

38
00:01:34.933 --> 00:01:38.333
So, this teacher and disciple don't care

39
00:01:38.333 --> 00:01:39.200
Otherwise

40
00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.266
How could I agree to your engagement with Aunt Chu Chu?
