00:00:00.533 --> 00:00:02.433
Su Wanqing, you are really good

2
00:00:02.566 --> 00:00:04.700
Since you are so shameless

3
00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:08.033
Don't blame me for being ruthless

4
00:00:10.066 --> 00:00:10.866
Chu Chu

5
00:00:11.533 --> 00:00:14.066
Let's let it go

6
00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:16.966
People have money, that's people's

7
00:00:17.066 --> 00:00:18.966
Who are we to live?

8
00:00:18.966 --> 00:00:22.166
Isn't it nice now? What do you know?

9
00:00:22.266 --> 00:00:23.666
If it weren't for your incompetence

10
00:00:23.666 --> 00:00:25.100
Am I working so hard?

11
00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:26.333
Forget it if you don't help me

12
00:00:26.333 --> 00:00:28.000
Still saying this here

13
00:00:28.933 --> 00:00:32.166
Blame me for not being able to provide you with a better life

14
00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:34.200
Mom

15
00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.266
How did we get through the hard days before?

16
00:00:36.266 --> 00:00:37.600
Have you forgotten?

17
00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.800
I don't want to live like being collected every day

18
00:00:40.133 --> 00:00:42.033
The days when dignity was trampled on

19
00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:48.500
Same people

20
00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:50.400
Why can't he be extravagant?

21
00:00:50.466 --> 00:00:51.533
We can't

22
00:00:51.533 --> 00:00:53.333
But but

23
00:00:53.333 --> 00:00:54.400
I think we do

24
00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.133
It still doesn't seem right.

25
00:00:56.133 --> 00:00:57.600
So what should be

26
00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:59.666
Should we just stay poor?

27
00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:01.866
Mom, believe me

28
00:01:01.933 --> 00:01:03.000
As long as you listen to me

29
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.700
We can definitely succeed

30
00:01:04.933 --> 00:01:06.966
You have to know that you can only rely on me

31
00:01:06.966 --> 00:01:08.300
Do you understand?

32
00:01:10.566 --> 00:01:12.133
And I don't have to hurt anyone.

33
00:01:12.133 --> 00:01:14.400
I'm just trying to get through some external pressure

34
00:01:14.533 --> 00:01:17.400
Let the monk cherish me well
