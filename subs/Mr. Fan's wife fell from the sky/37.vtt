00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:02.000
But I just moved in.

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.966
I upset grandma.

3
00:00:03.966 --> 00:00:06.466
How can I live here in the future?

4
00:00:06.466 --> 00:00:07.833
Oops ok ok

5
00:00:07.866 --> 00:00:09.400
This is not important.

6
00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:11.133
What are you doing?

7
00:00:11.133 --> 00:00:12.500
hum

8
00:00:14.266 --> 00:00:15.433
Ah Omori

9
00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:18.266
Hahaha, oops, it's alright.

10
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.200
Grandma just said

11
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.700
He's just going out for a few days

12
00:00:21.133 --> 00:00:22.433
Yes, Aunt Chu Chu

13
00:00:22.466 --> 00:00:23.800
According to the personality of the old lady

14
00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.200
If he doesn't like it, he'll say it directly

15
00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.100
Go out and live for a while now

16
00:00:28.166 --> 00:00:29.600
I want you to get used to it.

17
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:30.800
Who do you think you are?

18
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.766
Are you teasing grandma more than your junior year?

19
00:00:32.766 --> 00:00:36.100
Well, I think what Secretary Wanqing said is right

20
00:00:36.333 --> 00:00:37.833
That's what grandma meant

21
00:00:37.966 --> 00:00:40.633
Omori, I miss my mom

22
00:00:41.466 --> 00:00:43.166
Or you go back to live first

23
00:00:43.166 --> 00:00:45.033
That's not what I mean, Omori

24
00:00:45.533 --> 00:00:48.200
I live here alone with no one to take care of me

25
00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.066
I think my mom can come and take care of me

26
00:00:51.333 --> 00:00:53.666
Hmph, Omori, that's not what I mean

27
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:55.700
OK.

28
00:00:56.266 --> 00:00:57.566
Let mom live in

29
00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.966
Haha, I knew you were the best.
