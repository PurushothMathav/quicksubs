1
00:00:02.533 --> 00:00:04.166
Change me back

2
00:00:07.066 --> 00:00:10.266
What are you doing? Pack up and take me shopping for clothes.

3
00:00:10.333 --> 00:00:12.766
Buy it for me, actually buy it for me.

4
00:00:13.766 --> 00:00:15.866
Look at your clothes stink

5
00:00:16.566 --> 00:00:19.233
No, it smells good

6
00:00:19.566 --> 00:00:20.866
I told you to clean up

7
00:00:20.866 --> 00:00:22.800
What a lot of nonsense

8
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.866
Manager Su, I am Secretary Su

9
00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:25.933
I'll go to your store later.

10
00:00:25.933 --> 00:00:28.000
Take out all the most upscale clothing in your store

11
00:00:28.066 --> 00:00:29.066
For ladies

12
00:00:29.066 --> 00:00:30.166
Don't ask what you shouldn't ask

13
00:00:31.766 --> 00:00:33.200
Don't ask what you shouldn't ask

14
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.400
You listen to me

15
00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:36.900
a while

16
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.566
Mr. Fan's secretary wants to accompany Mr. Fan to pick out clothes

17
00:00:39.933 --> 00:00:41.400
We can't afford to offend this customer.

18
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:42.766
You must serve me, understand?

19
00:00:42.766 --> 00:00:44.066
Got it, manager.

20
00:00:44.166 --> 00:00:45.466
Mr. Fan's fiancee chooses clothes

21
00:00:45.466 --> 00:00:46.666
Why didn't he come by himself?

22
00:00:46.666 --> 00:00:48.100
I need a secretary to accompany me

23
00:00:48.733 --> 00:00:50.900
You shouldn't ask, don't ask

24
00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:52.366
Don't be angry, Chu Chu

25
00:00:52.366 --> 00:00:55.033
I'll compensate you, not pick two clothes to go home later.

26
00:00:55.266 --> 00:00:58.133
It's not the money that was corrupted at Fan Dasan's place

27
00:00:58.133 --> 00:00:59.766
Don't sound so bad

28
00:00:59.766 --> 00:01:02.000
I didn't spend this money for you yet.

29
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.366
Count you sensible

30
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.600
Hey, don't touch it if you don't buy it.

31
00:01:09.766 --> 00:01:12.400
Why are the clothes in your store not allowed to be touched?

32
00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.300
Help me get this one out. I'm gonna try it on.

33
00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:15.900
We are a high-end store here.

34
00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.266
It's all high-end luxury goods

35
00:01:17.266 --> 00:01:18.200
Expensive

36
00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.200
And we only accept VIP customers.

37
00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.300
You mean I can't afford it?

38
00:01:24.133 --> 00:01:26.700
With a poor man like you who is full of goods

39
00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.533
I also wear such high-end goods.

40
00:01:28.533 --> 00:01:30.600
I'm afraid even a sleeve is too expensive.
