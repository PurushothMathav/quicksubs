00:00:02.866 --> 00:00:04.000
Listen to a novel

2
00:00:09.533 --> 00:00:10.766
So hungry

3
00:00:19.266 --> 00:00:20.700
Ah hey

4
00:00:21.366 --> 00:00:24.900
Great, there is food hehe

5
00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.900
sit autumn

6
00:00:38.566 --> 00:00:40.166
Zuoqing Zuoqing

7
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:41.900
Suoqing

8
00:00:43.366 --> 00:00:44.166
Ah!

9
00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.666
Uh-huh.

10
00:00:48.466 --> 00:00:49.500
No sleep in the middle of the night

11
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.166
Why are you putting dragon fruit on your face?

12
00:00:51.166 --> 00:00:52.466
It almost scared me to death.

13
00:00:52.466 --> 00:00:53.666
Who scared you?

14
00:00:53.666 --> 00:00:55.166
Feed your stools

15
00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.500
Dragon fruit patted on the ground and didn't eat a bite

16
00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.366
Ouch, I've never seen someone as stupid as you.

17
00:01:02.333 --> 00:01:04.066
You can also hit me on the road

18
00:01:04.066 --> 00:01:05.800
Eating dragon fruit can also wrestle

19
00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.233
I really had ten lifetimes of bad luck when I met you

20
00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.600
Thick face hurts and deserves it

21
00:01:10.666 --> 00:01:13.133
And no horror novels in my house

22
00:01:13.133 --> 00:01:15.100
Let me find out and just throw away your phone

23
00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:16.833
Oops you can't throw my phone away

24
00:01:17.366 --> 00:01:19.333
I still have a lot of delicious pictures here.

25
00:01:19.333 --> 00:01:21.900
Eat and eat, you know to eat, that's right

26
00:01:22.133 --> 00:01:24.000
Why are you running to my room without sleeping in the middle of the night?

27
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.266
This is my house. Do I need to be sneaky?

28
00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:28.333
Alright. Alright.

29
00:01:28.333 --> 00:01:31.300
Then you go back to sleep, hahaha.
