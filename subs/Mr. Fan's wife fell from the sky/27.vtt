00:00:03.066 --> 00:00:04.000
Eh

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.366
Did you notice that Mr. Zhao treated me today?

3
00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:11.166
Is it just paying more attention to your body?

4
00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:14.500
OK

5
00:00:15.966 --> 00:00:17.966
Yo not bad

6
00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:19.833
How much are you going to do today?

7
00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:21.633
Hey, I'll wait for you.

8
00:00:22.566 --> 00:00:24.266
Anyway, you will be impatient later.

9
00:00:24.266 --> 00:00:26.100
I can't finish it, I'll go back to my room and get it myself

10
00:00:26.733 --> 00:00:28.366
Stop looking down on people

11
00:00:28.366 --> 00:00:32.766
I'll be done in a minute hmm ok hey

12
00:00:33.666 --> 00:00:35.433
Hmm look

13
00:00:35.966 --> 00:00:37.200
Is it all done?

14
00:00:39.566 --> 00:00:42.266
The company has to move back home after a day's work

15
00:00:42.266 --> 00:00:43.466
Make it late at night

16
00:00:43.533 --> 00:00:47.033
Hey, but at least it's better than before

17
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:48.400
Humph

18
00:00:52.133 --> 00:00:54.866
Butler, please call Wanqing over, okay?

19
00:00:54.866 --> 00:00:56.333
Grandma, what are you looking for me for?

20
00:00:56.333 --> 00:00:59.500
Hey, yes, yes, come and sit down if you have something to do.

21
00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.600
Let me tell you in the late Qing Dynasty

22
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.266
Grandma, after getting along with you these days

23
00:01:04.466 --> 00:01:05.700
I found out

24
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.466
You and our Omori

25
00:01:07.566 --> 00:01:10.366
They all talk and behave like grandma

26
00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:12.166
You already know that.

27
00:01:12.166 --> 00:01:14.466
Well, I already knew that

28
00:01:14.466 --> 00:01:16.233
But you have to understand

29
00:01:16.266 --> 00:01:18.966
Our junior year is engaged

30
00:01:19.133 --> 00:01:22.700
So you can only assist him in business.

31
00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:26.500
As for the money, he won't treat you badly.

32
00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:27.400
Oh.

33
00:01:27.766 --> 00:01:31.433
Hey, grandma, don't worry.

34
00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:32.500
Grandma don't worry

35
00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.166
Trust you, then I'll go first

36
00:01:35.166 --> 00:01:37.500
Grandma, slow down. Okay.
