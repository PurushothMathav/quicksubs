00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:01.700
Wow Chuchu

2
00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:03.433
You are amazing

3
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.800
Can find Fan Dasen so handsome

4
00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:07.166
Such a rich man

5
00:00:07.166 --> 00:00:08.000
How can there be?

6
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.266
We have always been truly in love

7
00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:14.000
Chuchu hahahaha

8
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.700
When we were in college

9
00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:18.300
Why didn't I know you were truly in love?

10
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.766
Ahahahaha

11
00:00:19.766 --> 00:00:20.900
Prince soup you

12
00:00:21.266 --> 00:00:23.600
I'll go back first

13
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.266
I'll come to the wedding tomorrow, okay?

14
00:00:26.266 --> 00:00:28.200
Bye bye, pay attention to safety on the road

15
00:00:29.666 --> 00:00:32.333
Old classmates don't call me when they get engaged

16
00:00:32.333 --> 00:00:35.366
After all, I made your marriage

17
00:00:35.466 --> 00:00:38.000
If I hadn't told you that Van Dasen is rich

18
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.400
You go after him?

19
00:00:40.733 --> 00:00:43.700
We two are truly in love, hahaha.

20
00:00:43.766 --> 00:00:45.600
Come on, pretend to be pure

21
00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:46.500
innocent

22
00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.500
Just your little trick is enough to make a movie of Fan Dasen

23
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.000
Still want to lie to me

24
00:00:52.066 --> 00:00:55.100
Well, I've seen a lot of women like you

25
00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:56.366
What do you want?

26
00:00:56.366 --> 00:00:58.233
Just say give me an invitation

27
00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.766
Let me go to tomorrow's engagement

28
00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.800
Impossible, I can also ask Fan Dasen for this invitation

29
00:01:06.166 --> 00:01:09.433
Don't you worry about what I say to him?

30
00:01:09.866 --> 00:01:10.666
Hey

31
00:01:12.133 --> 00:01:12.933
Humph

32
00:01:13.666 --> 00:01:16.466
Don't worry, I just want to get engaged

33
00:01:16.466 --> 00:01:18.933
Just meet more rich people at the ceremony

34
00:01:18.933 --> 00:01:20.266
I don't talk nonsense.

35
00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.366
Of course, I'm a little low on cash right now.

36
00:01:23.366 --> 00:01:25.233
Ask you to borrow some money for an emergency

37
00:01:25.666 --> 00:01:27.566
Guaranteed last time

38
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.166
Take the money and get out of here

39
00:01:36.266 --> 00:01:38.066
You can come to the engagement party tomorrow

40
00:01:38.366 --> 00:01:40.366
Keep your mouth shut for me

41
00:01:41.466 --> 00:01:43.200
That's a lot of money.
