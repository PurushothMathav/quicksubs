1
00:00:00.733 --> 00:00:01.966
Still not coming out?

2
00:00:02.966 --> 00:00:08.266
Hey, hahahahaha.

3
00:00:08.533 --> 00:00:09.900
And over there

4
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.166
I saw you

5
00:00:15.933 --> 00:00:17.366
Come out

6
00:00:18.366 --> 00:00:19.866
Since everyone is here

7
00:00:19.866 --> 00:00:21.600
Then I'll just announce it directly

8
00:00:22.733 --> 00:00:24.500
Fan Group Fan Dasen

9
00:00:24.566 --> 00:00:26.400
Engagement to Miss Wang Chuyi

10
00:00:26.533 --> 00:00:28.133
lift it.

11
00:00:28.133 --> 00:00:29.466
What the hell is going on?

12
00:00:29.466 --> 00:00:30.666
Are you all right?

13
00:00:30.666 --> 00:00:33.266
It's not Su Wanqing, what are you?

14
00:00:33.266 --> 00:00:34.700
Why did you break the engagement?

15
00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.200
That's why people listen to me

16
00:00:38.166 --> 00:00:39.100
I van Dasen

17
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:40.100
Today

18
00:00:40.166 --> 00:00:42.400
Break off the engagement with the lady in front of you, Wang Chuyi

19
00:00:42.533 --> 00:00:43.633
From Now On

20
00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:44.566
It doesn't matter anymore

21
00:00:44.566 --> 00:00:45.466
No way no

22
00:00:45.466 --> 00:00:47.266
No way. How could that be?

23
00:00:47.266 --> 00:00:49.633
Omori, you can't do this to me

24
00:00:50.166 --> 00:00:50.966
Ah!

25
00:00:52.266 --> 00:00:53.466
Oops what's wrong with this guy

26
00:00:53.466 --> 00:00:55.066
Mr. Fan, are you mistaken?

27
00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.966
My daughter made a mistake

28
00:00:55.966 --> 00:00:57.666
But it's good for you with all my heart

29
00:00:57.666 --> 00:00:59.166
You can't. You won't open the door.

30
00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:00.666
How can this be?

31
00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.533
Mr. Fan cancels the engagement

32
00:01:02.533 --> 00:01:04.133
You didn't consider the impact on the company

33
00:01:04.133 --> 00:01:05.366
Mr. Fan, you cancel the engagement

34
00:01:05.366 --> 00:01:06.900
Will it create a global national blockbuster?

35
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.733
Mr. Fan, are you giving up the Fan Group now?

36
00:01:08.733 --> 00:01:10.133
Is there a market in the industry?

37
00:01:10.133 --> 00:01:12.300
Being able to meet love is the word-of-mouth of the company's promotion.

38
00:01:12.466 --> 00:01:13.266
That's enough!

39
00:01:13.533 --> 00:01:15.866
Fan's Group relies on years of accumulation of strength

40
00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.033
Not by so-called false propaganda

41
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.166
And not only that.

42
00:01:21.866 --> 00:01:23.300
We will get married
