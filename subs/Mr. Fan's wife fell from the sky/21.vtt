00:00:01.766 --> 00:00:04.066
How did you read the information? Did you memorize it all?

2
00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:07.566
Oops! You scared me to death! Where have you been?

3
00:00:07.566 --> 00:00:09.033
It's not because of you

4
00:00:09.066 --> 00:00:10.766
I took the photo to repair.

5
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.800
Let you take a good look at the information. Are you lazy here?

6
00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:16.066
I see this money

7
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:17.400
I'm not slacking off.

8
00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:18.933
I'm just tired of watching

9
00:00:18.933 --> 00:00:20.366
Yeah, I'm just tired.

10
00:00:20.366 --> 00:00:22.500
Take the information back after get off work today and read it slowly.

11
00:00:22.533 --> 00:00:24.266
I'm going to sort it out in detail.

12
00:00:27.066 --> 00:00:28.266
Take it back and take a look.

13
00:00:28.266 --> 00:00:29.066
Come on.

14
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:31.766
I'm a woman, you make me do so much work

15
00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.233
No, you're a man now, huh?

16
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.266
Gee, I don't want to do it anymore.

17
00:00:40.266 --> 00:00:42.500
It's been less than an hour now

18
00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:43.700
Am I tired?

19
00:00:43.733 --> 00:00:45.633
It took so long to do so little

20
00:00:46.466 --> 00:00:48.500
So I don't want to do it anymore

21
00:00:48.533 --> 00:00:50.000
Long enough daylight?

22
00:00:50.166 --> 00:00:51.166
What are you doing?

23
00:00:51.166 --> 00:00:53.366
Am I not working in the company?

24
00:00:53.366 --> 00:00:55.700
Can you put this sentence in a very confident tone?

25
00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:56.466
Say it again

26
00:00:56.466 --> 00:00:57.966
I was very happy at the company during the day

27
00:00:58.766 --> 00:01:00.733
Ah, what are you doing now?

28
00:01:00.733 --> 00:01:02.966
It's so annoying to see what I'm doing, but you don't come to help me

29
00:01:02.966 --> 00:01:04.400
I'm waiting for you to ask.

30
00:01:04.733 --> 00:01:05.866
Annoying you

31
00:01:07.166 --> 00:01:09.100
So do you want to go or not?

32
00:01:09.366 --> 00:01:11.300
Don't press me with this gesture

33
00:01:11.933 --> 00:01:12.766
Humph

34
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:14.600
You make it clear

35
00:01:15.266 --> 00:01:16.833
I hate your arrogance

36
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.900
Okay, you want me to make it clear, right?

37
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.000
In a word

38
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.633
Mud can't hold up to the wall

39
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.166
Ok I'm leaving

40
00:01:24.566 --> 00:01:26.166
You me what me

41
00:01:26.166 --> 00:01:29.233
I'm not as lazy and useless as you are

42
00:01:29.933 --> 00:01:31.466
I'm not worthless

43
00:01:31.966 --> 00:01:32.900
I have love

44
00:01:34.466 --> 00:01:36.766
Okay, okay, you have love, right?
