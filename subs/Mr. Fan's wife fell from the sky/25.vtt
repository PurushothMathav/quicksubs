00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:02.800
Omori, why are you here?

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.800
Chu Chu, let me help you choose clothes

3
00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:09.433
It just so happens that you are picking slowly together.

4
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.466
Omori, you are so kind to me.

5
00:00:13.066 --> 00:00:14.266
What's he doing here?

6
00:00:14.266 --> 00:00:16.833
I'm worried that I can't see well.

7
00:00:17.066 --> 00:00:20.000
So let Secretary Su come and refer to it. Well, yes.

8
00:00:20.166 --> 00:00:20.700
OK

9
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:23.400
Then please ask Secretary Su to help me carry things later.

10
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:26.166
Okay, Miss Chuchu is leaving

11
00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:32.066
Omori, look at that bear over there, it's so cute

12
00:00:32.666 --> 00:00:33.666
Okay, Chuchu

13
00:00:33.933 --> 00:00:35.333
You can go home first.

14
00:00:35.333 --> 00:00:36.866
I'll ask the driver to take you back

15
00:00:37.166 --> 00:00:39.833
Omori, you are so kind to me.

16
00:00:40.533 --> 00:00:41.266
Ah, that's right.

17
00:00:41.266 --> 00:00:42.600
I want to move into your house.

18
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.000
Do you want to live with me?

19
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.800
We're getting married soon.

20
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.133
Sooner or later we will live together

21
00:00:47.133 --> 00:00:48.500
You are usually so busy with work

22
00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.300
I'm afraid no one will take care of you.

23
00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:51.700
Are there any servants in the manor?

24
00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:55.500
Oh, how can the maid be as careful as me? Pay attention to the image.

25
00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.133
Um no oops wait wait wait

26
00:00:58.133 --> 00:01:00.433
Oops please hum

27
00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:03.633
Oh, as for whether to live or not?

28
00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:06.000
Yes, Chu Chu

29
00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:07.966
Or I'll go first tomorrow.

30
00:01:07.966 --> 00:01:10.733
Let you take a look at our manor first.

31
00:01:10.733 --> 00:01:13.066
Let's put the living thing aside for now

32
00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.233
Ok oops oops I suddenly have a stomachache

33
00:01:17.333 --> 00:01:18.300
What's up junior year

34
00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:19.900
Uh, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay?

35
00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:20.866
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay

36
00:01:20.866 --> 00:01:22.433
Secretary Su handed it over to you everywhere

37
00:01:22.933 --> 00:01:24.966
This fool is really embarrassing me

38
00:01:24.966 --> 00:01:26.500
Secretary Su

39
00:01:26.933 --> 00:01:29.600
Then this couple will ask you to put it in the car for me

40
00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:30.900
Okay, Miss Chuchu
