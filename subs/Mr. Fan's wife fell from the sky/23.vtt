1
00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:03.900
With a poor man like you who is full of goods

2
00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:05.766
I also wear such high-end goods.

3
00:00:05.766 --> 00:00:07.700
I'm afraid even a button is too expensive.

4
00:00:07.866 --> 00:00:10.400
You'd better go to the wholesale market opposite to take a look.

5
00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.266
Why do you look down on people?

6
00:00:13.066 --> 00:00:14.200
Help me pack this one up.

7
00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:15.533
Sorry lady

8
00:00:15.533 --> 00:00:17.300
Our store only accepts VIP customers.

9
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:19.800
Please go out, who am I?

10
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.666
Isn't this poor and noble cake?

11
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:23.833
Huh?

12
00:00:24.366 --> 00:00:26.133
When did you start following fashion?

13
00:00:26.133 --> 00:00:29.366
After being dumped by me, did you start to think about the pain?

14
00:00:29.366 --> 00:00:31.600
Hahaha, save it.

15
00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.966
You were lucky at Van Dassen's engagement

16
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.900
Hmph, you are a part-time worker.

17
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.200
Also go to luxury stores to buy clothes

18
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.300
Haha, your brain is burned out, right?

19
00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:44.833
Don't touch your feet

20
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:47.666
How about I introduce you to some old black people?

21
00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.233
You spend a few nights with him

22
00:00:49.266 --> 00:00:50.500
I'll give you two.

23
00:00:50.766 --> 00:00:52.466
No, how about ten more?

24
00:00:52.866 --> 00:00:55.566
Hahahaha, no wonder the golden hoop is over.

25
00:00:55.566 --> 00:00:58.300
Hahaha, this virtue is disgusting enough.

26
00:00:59.266 --> 00:01:01.100
Do you know what this is?

27
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.300
VIP, hahahaha, do you know what this is?

28
00:01:07.166 --> 00:01:10.266
Just take out a broken card and try to get away with it

29
00:01:10.566 --> 00:01:12.166
This is the Supreme VIP.
