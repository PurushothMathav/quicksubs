00:00:00.466 --> 00:00:04.166
Wow, Omori, your home is really beautiful.

2
00:00:06.466 --> 00:00:10.100
Hey, Omori, come here, there are fish

3
00:00:10.966 --> 00:00:13.066
Wow, you actually have a fish pond here?

4
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.000
Yeah, I used to go fishing here with my grandma

5
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.033
Really? Yes, I want to fish too, right?

6
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.366
Hey, it's hard to do.

7
00:00:21.366 --> 00:00:23.800
Junior year goes by so fast

8
00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.200
If only I could stay here forever

9
00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:27.433
Haha, that's okay.

10
00:00:28.133 --> 00:00:29.033
OK

11
00:00:29.766 --> 00:00:32.133
Well, it's a little too late today.

12
00:00:32.133 --> 00:00:33.766
Why don't I take you back?

13
00:00:33.766 --> 00:00:35.100
You just said yes.

14
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.666
But I can move in, right?

15
00:00:36.666 --> 00:00:37.733
Did you just say something?

16
00:00:37.733 --> 00:00:40.133
You just said I'm moving in tomorrow

17
00:00:40.133 --> 00:00:41.366
Okay?

18
00:00:41.366 --> 00:00:42.866
Tomorrow? Hmm.

19
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:43.700
Assistant Su

20
00:00:43.733 --> 00:00:45.566
Is there a lot of work in the company tomorrow?

21
00:00:45.566 --> 00:00:48.633
Yes, Mr. Fan, the company has a regular meeting tomorrow, oops, Chuchu.

22
00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:50.533
Why don't I take you back first?

23
00:00:50.533 --> 00:00:53.033
Can we talk about this later?

24
00:01:00.733 --> 00:01:03.333
Stop! Did I do something wrong?

25
00:01:03.333 --> 00:01:05.366
Why did you promise Chu Chu to live in just now?

26
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.300
Didn't I hurry up?

27
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:08.966
I think

28
00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.200
You might want him to live in and spend time with you

29
00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.433
Ah, that's right.

30
00:01:12.466 --> 00:01:14.100
I want to spend time with him

31
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:15.966
And who am I now?

32
00:01:15.966 --> 00:01:18.800
I'm you, didn't I think of it?

33
00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.466
Besides, he didn't live in either?

34
00:01:20.466 --> 00:01:22.500
No, but you made him a promise

35
00:01:22.866 --> 00:01:25.166
I, Fan Dasen, have always kept my promises

36
00:01:25.733 --> 00:01:26.533
Humph

37
00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:33.700
that

38
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.000
Crying like Lin Daiyu

39
00:01:36.266 --> 00:01:37.900
Am I crying like Lin Daiyu?

40
00:01:38.066 --> 00:01:39.766
Are you not?

41
00:01:40.166 --> 00:01:42.200
I've just never seen myself cry so much

42
00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.500
It's so ugly to cry

43
00:01:44.733 --> 00:01:46.166
Don't you kill me?

44
00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.066
Otherwise, I will cry and worry about you every day.
