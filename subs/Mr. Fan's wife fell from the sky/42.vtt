00:00:01.066 --> 00:00:02.600
Why don't you let me wear my new clothes?

2
00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:04.966
You have the nerve to say you wear it at home

3
00:00:04.966 --> 00:00:06.166
It's fine if I didn't scold you

4
00:00:06.166 --> 00:00:07.833
Come to the company and want to embarrass me

5
00:00:07.866 --> 00:00:09.333
I think Chu Chu likes it very much

6
00:00:09.333 --> 00:00:10.566
Otherwise, you would have let me take it off long ago

7
00:00:10.566 --> 00:00:12.166
If you talk back, you will deduct 10,000.

8
00:00:12.166 --> 00:00:12.966
you

9
00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:15.566
Continue to read the information you haven't read before

10
00:00:15.566 --> 00:00:16.700
I'll tell you again.

11
00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:18.100
Our company is a national

12
00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:19.566
Our company is a national

13
00:00:19.566 --> 00:00:21.633
The largest haute couture jewelry company

14
00:00:21.733 --> 00:00:24.000
The company's mission is to love forever

15
00:00:24.933 --> 00:00:27.266
The company's most famous product is true love

16
00:00:27.266 --> 00:00:27.966
Unique series

17
00:00:27.966 --> 00:00:29.700
The last time, when Chu Chu got engaged

18
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:30.966
The ones you gave him

19
00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:32.600
It's really rotten to eat the stuffing

20
00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:35.100
I've already memorized all that. Okay.

21
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.566
Just remember it all.

22
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.700
Then you must add some money and a chocolate for me.

23
00:00:39.066 --> 00:00:40.000
Cut right

24
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.700
I went through the company's accounts before and there were some problems

25
00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:44.966
And the internal design draft shows signs of outflow

26
00:00:44.966 --> 00:00:46.933
I suspect the company has an insider

27
00:00:46.933 --> 00:00:48.033
Who would that be?

28
00:00:48.966 --> 00:00:51.033
Hmm, come in

29
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.566
Mr. Fan, we have a group of jewelry series buyers.

30
00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:57.866
Ask to have dinner with you tonight, what do you think?

31
00:00:57.866 --> 00:00:59.033
Ah, eat!

32
00:00:59.566 --> 00:01:00.466
Where are we going?

33
00:01:00.533 --> 00:01:02.333
Hey, what about Mr. Chen and the others?

34
00:01:02.333 --> 00:01:04.166
It's a new customer of our company, right?

35
00:01:04.166 --> 00:01:05.600
What is the strength of the other party?

36
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.200
Su Ming said that the strength behind this batch of customers is extraordinary

37
00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.866
Very satisfied with our products.

38
00:01:09.966 --> 00:01:12.533
Well, it's the line of high-value customers worth keeping

39
00:01:12.533 --> 00:01:14.000
Mr. Chen, just arrange it directly.

40
00:01:14.133 --> 00:01:15.233
Mr. Fan, look

41
00:01:15.266 --> 00:01:17.833
Hmph, then listen to Secretary Su's arrangement

42
00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:19.300
Good Mr. Fan
