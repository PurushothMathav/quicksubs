00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.633
Welcome Mr. Fan home

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.800
Are these people very discerning?

3
00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:05.700
I didn't get this treatment the first time I came.

4
00:00:06.133 --> 00:00:07.966
What's wrong, Omori?

5
00:00:07.966 --> 00:00:08.900
Nothing.

6
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.433
Just thinking of going in and out of here a lot in the future

7
00:00:11.866 --> 00:00:12.766
Happy to think about it

8
00:00:12.766 --> 00:00:14.300
I'm Omori too

9
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:16.233
Oh, dear.

10
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.900
Miss Fan Chuchu, thank goodness, come over quickly

11
00:00:22.333 --> 00:00:24.533
Chu Chu, this is the assistant of the company

12
00:00:24.533 --> 00:00:26.500
Su Wanqing has seen it several times

13
00:00:26.666 --> 00:00:28.200
Due to the busy work recently

14
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:29.333
So I brought him here.

15
00:00:29.333 --> 00:00:30.333
Help me with my work.

16
00:00:30.333 --> 00:00:31.000
Assistant Su

17
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
You take Miss Chu Chu here to familiarize yourself with the environment

18
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:33.933
I go to the bathroom

19
00:00:33.933 --> 00:00:34.866
Ok Mr. Fan

20
00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:36.666
Miss Chuchu

21
00:00:36.666 --> 00:00:40.100
I'll take you on a tour first. What do you call me, miss?

22
00:00:40.133 --> 00:00:42.500
The other servants call me Mrs. Fan

23
00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.100
You actually call me miss

24
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.000
Yes, you are now madam.

25
00:00:46.266 --> 00:00:48.733
I warn you not to play Omori's mind

26
00:00:48.733 --> 00:00:49.700
Don't think about anything.

27
00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:51.600
Flying up the branches and becoming a phoenix

28
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.833
Do you know how long I have been in a relationship with him?

29
00:00:53.866 --> 00:00:57.066
My feelings for him have not been repelled by a terminal illness

30
00:00:57.066 --> 00:00:59.300
I didn't expect you to love me so much

31
00:00:59.466 --> 00:01:00.900
What are you pretending to be pitiful here?

32
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:02.400
Omori is not here

33
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:03.833
What's up?

34
00:01:05.166 --> 00:01:06.166
Ah, nothing.

35
00:01:06.166 --> 00:01:09.233
It's okay, junior year, let's go, let's go, I'll take you for a walk

36
00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.700
Wow, Omori, your home is really beautiful.

37
00:01:17.533 --> 00:01:18.333
Humph
