00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:02.733
This place should look like this

2
00:00:02.733 --> 00:00:03.966
I see it, I know.

3
00:00:07.333 --> 00:00:08.133
Borrow or not

4
00:00:09.133 --> 00:00:09.966
borrow borrow

5
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.333
Long time no see, how are you?

6
00:00:12.333 --> 00:00:15.866
Your Buddha wants to die, but he didn't survive. Come here.

7
00:00:15.866 --> 00:00:17.933
Late Qing Dynasty, are you really looking for a shortcoming?

8
00:00:17.933 --> 00:00:19.300
You misunderstood me in the late Qing Dynasty

9
00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.133
I love you so much that I'm afraid of losing you

10
00:00:21.133 --> 00:00:22.400
In the end, I found that I couldn't do without

11
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:23.900
Some time after you left

12
00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:25.500
I miss you all the time

13
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.100
Thinking of you, thinking of madness, thinking of tears

14
00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:29.366
I want you to stay up all night, stop reciting poems

15
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:30.800
Tell me what you want

16
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.366
I want to meet you.

17
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.800
Okay, okay.

18
00:00:35.866 --> 00:00:37.500
See you at the cafe at 4pm today

19
00:00:38.366 --> 00:00:40.600
Come on, why would you agree to meet this kind of person?

20
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.500
Oh, dear.

21
00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.033
I just want to see what he's up to

22
00:00:44.266 --> 00:00:45.866
Boring me van Dasen

23
00:00:45.866 --> 00:00:46.900
Never on such a person

24
00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:48.100
Waste an extra second

25
00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:48.666
and

26
00:00:48.666 --> 00:00:50.800
I haven't investigated everything about my company clearly.

27
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:51.600
Not available.

28
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.900
Oh, can you help me once? Why don't you go?

29
00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:57.266
Oh, just once.

30
00:00:57.466 --> 00:00:58.266
Just once.

31
00:00:58.466 --> 00:01:00.700
Oh, please! What are you doing?

32
00:01:02.366 --> 00:01:03.600
Secretary Su

33
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.166
I want to criticize you severely

34
00:01:05.266 --> 00:01:07.400
This AR game is not fun at all

35
00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.400
Will I believe you because of your explanation?

36
00:01:09.766 --> 00:01:10.600
Omori

37
00:01:11.066 --> 00:01:13.466
I've never seen you like this before.

38
00:01:13.933 --> 00:01:14.733
uncle

39
00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:18.233
Go coax, okay

40
00:01:18.333 --> 00:01:19.666
I'll help you coax this.

41
00:01:19.666 --> 00:01:21.266
You help me go to the coffee shop to solve that.

42
00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.000
That's it. Okay. Hello

43
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.400
Hmm

44
00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.166
I haven't agreed yet.
