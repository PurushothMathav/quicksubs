00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:02.666
But the one who is truly destined

2
00:00:02.866 --> 00:00:05.333
You can completely feel the other party's soul

3
00:00:05.333 --> 00:00:06.166
That's not possible.

4
00:00:06.333 --> 00:00:08.600
The person I am destined to be is obviously Chu Chu

5
00:00:09.933 --> 00:00:10.933
Don't worry.

6
00:00:10.933 --> 00:00:14.300
Time will always give the best answer to anything

7
00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:16.266
Well, your bodies are fine.

8
00:00:16.266 --> 00:00:17.600
Then you can do whatever you want.

9
00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.100
I'm going to work first.

10
00:00:24.066 --> 00:00:25.033
Leave it alone.

11
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:26.866
Let's find a way to change it back.

12
00:00:27.066 --> 00:00:28.233
How to change it?

13
00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.200
You ready? You ready?

14
00:00:34.533 --> 00:00:37.433
Come 321

15
00:00:38.266 --> 00:00:39.400
Ya Ya Ya

16
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:40.800
Yeah.

17
00:00:41.733 --> 00:00:44.866
Haha, my butt.

18
00:00:45.366 --> 00:00:47.100
I guess you fell it.

19
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.600
Is it?

20
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:49.433
Try it on.

21
00:00:50.133 --> 00:00:51.166
Take it easy

22
00:00:51.166 --> 00:00:53.100
Don't worry, it's alright.

23
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.033
Be gentle, don't smash me to death, don't talk nonsense

24
00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.466
Oops oops

25
00:00:57.466 --> 00:00:58.633
Hahaha

26
00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:00.966
Did it work? No

27
00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.566
Oh, your posture is wrong.

28
00:01:03.733 --> 00:01:05.900
What's wrong? Do it again.

29
00:01:08.866 --> 00:01:11.966
Come on, take it easy, don't kill me

30
00:01:11.966 --> 00:01:13.466
Stop talking nonsense

31
00:01:13.866 --> 00:01:14.700
Did I say that?

32
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:20.033
I was the one who smashed you

33
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.800
Why haven't you come back yet?

34
00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.866
No, what happened to it?

35
00:01:28.066 --> 00:01:29.766
How did this kill you?

36
00:01:30.166 --> 00:01:31.400
There is no way now.

37
00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:32.800
Tomorrow you go and get engaged to me

38
00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.633
From now on, I will tell you everything about me

39
00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:37.666
Then use your secretary status

40
00:01:37.666 --> 00:01:38.800
Live in my own home

41
00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:40.266
Why should I listen to you?

42
00:01:41.266 --> 00:01:42.700
Just because you don't listen

43
00:01:42.966 --> 00:01:44.766
I can mess around with your body
