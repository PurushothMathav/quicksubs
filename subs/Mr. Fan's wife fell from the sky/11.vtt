00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:06.566
Mr. Fan, you are really kind.

2
00:00:07.066 --> 00:00:09.800
Although I mentioned my feelings to you before

3
00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:12.466
But I didn't expect you to remember it all at once

4
00:00:13.766 --> 00:00:15.600
But for such a scumbag

5
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.000
Affect your engagement

6
00:00:17.166 --> 00:00:18.400
Not worth it.

7
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.000
It was slashed today.

8
00:00:21.466 --> 00:00:22.800
I'll tell you about it.

9
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.700
Ah prince prince is a scum

10
00:00:24.766 --> 00:00:25.966
Specialized mixed-race girl

11
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.100
He cheats money and his feelings

12
00:00:28.533 --> 00:00:29.466
I really owe you

13
00:00:30.566 --> 00:00:33.200
I heard Secretary Su talk about him before.

14
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.800
What was Mr. Fan shouting just now?

15
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.666
He said the man cheated on his feelings

16
00:00:36.666 --> 00:00:38.533
Oh, Fan can't really be that kind of person, can he?

17
00:00:38.533 --> 00:00:41.200
Hey, I don't know, I don't know what you said about this kind of deception.

18
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.233
Should a man with a little girl's feelings be beaten?

19
00:00:43.466 --> 00:00:45.800
Mr. Fan can't talk nonsense

20
00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:47.833
Enough.

21
00:00:48.933 --> 00:00:51.566
Omori, do you want to get engaged or not?

22
00:00:51.566 --> 00:00:53.200
Of course, of course.

23
00:00:53.566 --> 00:00:55.333
Of course. Of course. Engaged

24
00:00:55.333 --> 00:00:57.166
Well, don't worry, grandma.

25
00:00:57.466 --> 00:00:58.600
Chu Chu, don't worry.

26
00:01:00.266 --> 00:01:01.066
OK

27
00:01:01.666 --> 00:01:02.466
Humph

28
00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.866
Well, it will delay the engagement time later

29
00:01:15.966 --> 00:01:17.233
Good idea.

30
00:01:17.333 --> 00:01:19.900
It turns out that Fan Shao is such a formal person

31
00:01:20.066 --> 00:01:21.833
I saw it today

32
00:01:21.933 --> 00:01:25.000
But my fight today will definitely not be in vain

33
00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.900
And you, Su Wanqing, just wait and see.

34
00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:35.766
Oh good yeah

35
00:01:36.166 --> 00:01:38.900
But why is he here?

36
00:01:39.166 --> 00:01:39.966
Here you are.

37
00:01:42.766 --> 00:01:43.566
Oh.

38
00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:44.900
Humph
