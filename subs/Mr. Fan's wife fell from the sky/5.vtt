00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:02.766
Just because you don't listen

2
00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:05.766
I can mess with you with your body

3
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:08.900
Then you have to promise me one condition.

4
00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:09.900
You have to give me money.

5
00:00:09.933 --> 00:00:12.366
I still pay 200 yuan for painting the wall a day.

6
00:00:12.966 --> 00:00:14.566
I'll give you 20,000 day

7
00:00:15.666 --> 00:00:17.900
20,000 month is 600,000

8
00:00:18.666 --> 00:00:19.900
Are you bragging?

9
00:00:20.066 --> 00:00:22.233
It's a scum routine at a glance

10
00:00:22.266 --> 00:00:23.400
Give me your phone

11
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:26.366
Why is this my phone? Then give me my phone too.

12
00:00:26.366 --> 00:00:27.233
Go you

13
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.300
I'm really here 600,000 hum

14
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:32.966
Are you really the God of Wealth?

15
00:00:33.733 --> 00:00:34.533
Okay.

16
00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.066
From today on, you will live in my house

17
00:00:37.066 --> 00:00:38.166
Don't touch your feet

18
00:00:38.166 --> 00:00:40.066
Good luck god of wealth

19
00:00:41.533 --> 00:00:43.566
Oh, where is it for you to pay?

20
00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.233
It's all here, it's all here.

21
00:00:46.366 --> 00:00:46.933
Hey

22
00:00:46.933 --> 00:00:49.200
A house as big as yours costs millions, right?

23
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.200
Not much, just 500 million

24
00:00:51.366 --> 00:00:52.766
500 million.

25
00:00:53.966 --> 00:00:56.300
God, this is so luxurious

26
00:00:56.866 --> 00:01:01.000
Wow, your lawn is so big!

27
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:02.766
If it were me

28
00:01:03.133 --> 00:01:04.666
I only have 10 cows

29
00:01:05.066 --> 00:01:06.066
Raise another flock of sheep

30
00:01:06.133 --> 00:01:07.466
And a bunch of puppies.

31
00:01:08.166 --> 00:01:09.666
Otherwise, it will be too wasteful.

32
00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.766
You know, I brought you here to get engaged tomorrow

33
00:01:12.766 --> 00:01:13.866
Don't mess it up for me.

34
00:01:13.866 --> 00:01:15.200
I know, I know.

35
00:01:15.566 --> 00:01:17.066
I'm a little hungry first

36
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.300
I never put mood words in front of me when I speak

37
00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:20.466
You have to change this.

38
00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.166
Secondly, don't act like you haven't seen the world

39
00:01:23.166 --> 00:01:25.133
It's really expensive to buy anything for 50 cents.

40
00:01:25.133 --> 00:01:26.200
What do you mean?

41
00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.100
Gone to eat
