00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:03.740
Don't let people fly away just yet, haha.

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:05.740
Yes.

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:08.920
No three no three no four

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:09.800
This time it's a draw.

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:11.860
Have the courage to play me another game.

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:14.680
Better who is afraid of who is the nephew.

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:17.180
Then we go in circles.

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.320
Where do I catch it?

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.860
Go away, what's wrong, Pham Hien?

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:23.820
This emei has no cricket.

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:25.940
You lost.

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:29.220
How does it feel to jump into a hole you dug yourself?

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:30.580
The King's Cricket

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.400
That is a bully

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:33.560
Not just big

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:36.080
Moreover, the back is wide and the thighs are thick.

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:37.240
Extremely strong fighting power

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:39.160
One hundred games without defeat.

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:42.500
What do you take?

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.320
Pham Hien, how do you carry a person?

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:49.120
People

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:50.660
Where?

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:52.880
This is clearly a cricket.

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:54.160
Are you stupid?

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.460
This is clearly a personal error.

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:57.840
Big mistake.

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.260
Add wrong

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.100
This is clearly a cricket.

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:03.700
Sit down.

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.380
Your Highness, you do not sing this song.

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:09.740
Must be music.

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.920
This is fallacy.

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.700
Is this your place to talk?

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.300
Your Highness, you wouldn't dare compare, would you?

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:21.180
Better than good is having you on hand.
