00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:05.660
You guys have brought me this far.

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:07.340
Pay me a lot

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.380
I assure you I will not do you wrong.

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:12.260
I saw this longevity.

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:15.100
Don't worry, he'll wake up soon.

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:19.980
The method you think is fake.

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:22.300
Are not.

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.520
Only he didn't know that Wukong had to fly himself on the training ground.

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:28.420
Otherwise, life happens.

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:32.700
Ha ha ha ha ha

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.140
I have mastered it.

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:36.660
What now?

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.180
It's okay, I'm just afraid he doesn't practice.

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:41.120
You are the way of death.

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.960
What do you mean I'm going to die?

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.900
I now not only hold the Truong Sinh Tuoc

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.820
Moreover, I also have martial arts.

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:51.600
Ha ha ha

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.180
I am now in this world.

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.300
The longest living person

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.700
Why did you come back to life?

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.740
That's because the old lady doesn't have much life left.

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.020
Tell me, if your wife can kill you once, how can she kill you a second time?

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:12.680
How is that possible?

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:13.820
Where is my inner strength?

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.820
Is Pham Hien your ghost?

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.520
Are you calculating me?

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:20.420
Many unjust acts must be reversed.

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.340
All of this is up to you to find out.

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:23.700
It must be you.

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.700
It must be your calculation.

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.680
You never thought that practicing the Longevity Sparrow would require wasting your own martial arts.

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.860
Otherwise two inland lands are fighting here.

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:34.260
The meridians do not stop until the end of life.

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.140
Immortality is not shameless.

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:39.740
Should be killed or be killed

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.660
If not, why didn't Old Town become extinct?

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.500
Am I right?
