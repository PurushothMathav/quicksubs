00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.240
Don't be afraid.

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:05.740
Tell me what you wish for, I can make it come true for you.

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:06.520
Really?

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:08.380
Of course.

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:09.700
She doesn't know.

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:11.800
I have been an orphan since I was a child.

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:13.220
No parents

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:18.060
Actually, my biggest wish is to make my own money.

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:21.220
Orphan, I get it.

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:22.620
What do you understand?

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:24.200
I want money.

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:25.500
Don't get me wrong.

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.660
Everyone heard it.

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:37.600
He said he was an orphan.

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.580
I helped him meet his parents again.

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.520
I believe he will be pleased.

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.020
He did not object anyway.

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:47.780
Your turn, it's not easy.

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.060
In the Devil's sect dare to fight me.

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:51.160
It is impossible to judge for yourself.

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:52.540
Just wait and see.

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.180
The first time I saw him.

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.080
like you

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:03.420
I don't know if you want to marry me.

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:05.620
You can not promise him.

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.800
Now I have a competitor.

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.900
What good is Master, Pham Hien?

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.940
Turns out you like this kind.

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.740
Young man, you are a good person.

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.000
Turns out it's a good guy card.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.060
See?

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.580
I am a good person.

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.620
I am the true leader of the Demonic Cult.

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.460
Timing

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.580
The directors also almost brought people.

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:27.980
Because of the directors' blow

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:29.340
I mean enough.

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.100
I didn't expect him to come back.

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:35.640
I can find Master Guo.

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:36.680
What are you talking about?

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:38.600
What Master Guo, don't look for it anymore.

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.660
If I can't find Master Guo, I don't intend to live anymore.

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:43.780
Take life for money

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:45.900
Colonel, he wants to commit suicide.

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.760
Please don't believe me, this is a real demon professor.

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:54.740
Just wait to die with the devil's sect ha ha ha

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.020
Alive, we are all fooled.
