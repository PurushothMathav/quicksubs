00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:03.400
For years now no one in the family wants to be a beggar anymore.

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:06.060
If this continues, the Cult will die.

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:08.660
He is also of the Beg sect?

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:11.800
Could it be that he also came to steal the second cultivation method?

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:13.700
Do you want to rebel with me?

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.140
I don't want to.

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:17.320
Rebellion is the crime of the Chu Cuu clan.

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:19.580
Moreover, was Miss Lanh killed by you?

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.580
She is the daughter of the former leader.

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.900
You have to give us an answer today.

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:27.180
Is he calm?

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:28.160
Say it.

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.980
Looks like you want to confront this gang leader.

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.220
Tanglin, I killed you.

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:38.520
Who are you?

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:39.920
I came here to save the beggars.

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:41.460
I've always had a history with cults.

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.780
You don't believe I have a token?

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:49.920
This is the secret of our state.

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.340
Can I still lie to you?

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:53.880
They say calm is you, right?

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:55.980
Yes, because I am against rebellion.

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:57.880
This monster is going to kill me.

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:59.880
If you trust me then come with me.

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.340
This story Pham ca arranged troops for you.

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:03.860
But I don't like it either.

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:05.120
If you can help me.

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.000
I can agree to any of your terms. This is not the place to talk.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.980
Let's go.

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.780
Who else?

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:17.240
Who?
