00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:07.900
Ha ha ha

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:09.120
Soup.

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:13.020
Find a set of demon clothes to change into for him later.

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:17.620
Wait until the martial arts convention to make him the sect leader.

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.340
What if Pham Hien did not practice?

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:25.820
If Pham Hien dares to appear at the martial arts convention, he will certainly die.

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.540
Now most of the sects have surrendered at my puppet gate.

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:31.140
I'm afraid he won't come.

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:34.460
If not, the widow will become the leader.

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.900
Still not determined enough.

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:45.180
If the villagers don't kill him one day, it will be a thorn in my heart.

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.900
They must be completely removed.

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.220
Now I will go to the puppet door and kill To Truong To.

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:54.520
I mean it.

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:57.160
Even if he has the king of guns, I'm still a shameful person.

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.700
Listen to me, we'll go find him and agree.

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:02.980
I can't wait anyway.

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.600
But now no one will believe anything we say.

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.080
This is not okay, that is not okay.

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.320
he is angry with me

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:11.180
The most important thing now is to conserve strength.

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.500
Alliance of Others

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:14.820
Isn't he flirting with us?

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.100
We are going to the martial arts convention.

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:18.820
expose him and kill him.

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.380
Revenge for Brown Village.

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.220
But currently, only invited sects can enter the martial arts convention.

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.240
Normal small door can not enter.

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.780
Then we can pretend to be qualified disciples of a sect.
