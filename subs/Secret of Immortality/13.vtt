00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:05.380
It's simple, whoever knocks over the glass of water behind the chair wins.

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:08.620
Go away.

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:11.520
YES.

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:18.700
This.

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.240
Is this still available?

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:24.700
What's the hurry?

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:30.840
YES.

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:32.700
She is lying.

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:35.680
The referee and the players are all mine.

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:37.240
The rules are all set by me.

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:39.280
What can you, a country bumpkin, compete with me for?

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:40.440
Self assessment

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.820
He compared himself to the King.

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:46.960
That is the difference between the frog at the bottom of the well and the bright moonlight.

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:48.560
Do you understand?

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:52.500
Bach Tam Lan, I do not allow you to insult the Royal Family like that.

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.140
Sharp teeth and sharp mouth

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.060
Everyone is about to die, but their mouths are still so stiff.

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.080
What are you, Van?

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.820
Learn Mathematics

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:10.740
Travel the world without fear

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:13.100
Let's go.

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.220
Go away, why me?

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.020
This.

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.260
Now I will show you the power of science.

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.220
YES.

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.340
Hey.

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:32.800
Accepted?

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.340
Ha ha, you can laugh me to death.

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.080
Your eyesight is not good, is it?

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.540
Don't let people fly away all at once.
