00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:02.400
There will be no ghosts, right?

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:04.020
So what do we do now?

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:05.900
Find medicine to save people first.

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:07.500
HAS.

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:19.740
I found it.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.420
Feed the Bang Leader quickly.

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.860
So now we should report the situation of the flat boxing gate to the fair lord.

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.300
What happened here was strange.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.620
Okay, let's see if there are any survivors.

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.580
Find out what's going on.

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:58.940
I want to help.

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:04.100
Something is wrong, he won't take the ghost away like the people at the sparrow gate right?

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:05.360
What are you thinking?

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.060
This world has no ghosts and gods.

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:08.180
Even if there really are ghosts

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.040
Every ghost you fear is not the one others remember.

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:11.840
So...

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.020
So what now?

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:15.740
As long as it is human made.

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:17.060
Will definitely show the horse's legs.

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:20.180
So what are we doing tonight?

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:21.540
We sleep together.

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:22.980
After midnight

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:24.500
I am on guard

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.180
HAS.

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:56.060
Damn it.

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:58.180
Where is the blood door?
