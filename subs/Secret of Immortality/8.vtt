Salty

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:05.780
Van Xim, I didn't expect you to be such a pervert.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.600
Cooperate with her.

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:10.100
That's me being charming.

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:15.080
Okay, then today I will kill you two myself.

Let go. I'm not blind.

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:35.940
Not important.

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:37.820
I can make you the top.

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:40.140
Or do I not want it anymore?

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:41.900
So what is your condition?

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.020
Bedroom need me to play with you?

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.380
My conditions

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:50.140
Just show me a little bit of the immortality code kept by your Emei sect.

Longevity

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.320
How do you know that there is a first level cultivation method of the Longevity Technique on Emei?

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.880
You may not believe it if I say it.

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:57.960
I'm dying.

My village was killed by the enemy.

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:08.420
I am alone.

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.220
If I die, no one will avenge them.

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.220
Face full of shit

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.380
Not sincere.
