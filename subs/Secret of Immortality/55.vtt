00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:01.740
Today I met a master.

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:03.660
Why don't you say anything?

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:05.960
The premise of dedication is equality.

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:07.140
You want others to give

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:08.780
You yourself do not give

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:11.180
What? Are you a thug?

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:12.300
Unfortunately someone else did

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:14.680
Because you don't want to give

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:16.000
Don't come to our demonic sect.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.420
Our sect only recruits good people.

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:19.840
Let me be brief.

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:21.380
Everyone must study hard.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.540
Read many good books

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:25.560
Don't be fooled

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:26.940
You let people give.

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:28.660
Neither is good.

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:30.500
That is not called dedication.

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:31.640
That is called death.

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:32.660
So you say.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.820
Why are you a good person?

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.100
Listen, I'm famous.

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.440
I am a good person.

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:41.600
Is there anything wrong?

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.980
You, you are reversing black and white.

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.140
Nonsense.

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.220
so angry

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:48.360
I am a good person.

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.540
I am the good person.

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:50.500
Everybody.

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:52.280
Is there anything wrong?

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.060
Okay, she considers herself a good person.

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.240
Our demonic rule is given first.

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:58.520
I will not give.

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.200
Or did you dedicate your life to me?

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.360
Wait until I finish studying and I will return it to you.

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:04.520
You think I'm stupid.

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:06.360
You look stupid.

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.340
You must not insult others.

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:09.580
Mr. Ngo said go.

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.660
You look like a dog.

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:13.260
Are you a man or a dog?

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.980
Go away, go away, master.

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:20.700
I tell you.

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.820
Our leader is really good.

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:25.340
Our leader kills people without blinking an eye.

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:28.020
Our leader was killed three days and three nights ago.

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:29.220
I tell you.

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.420
You're done, but I want to ask.

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.660
You said your leader kills people without blinking an eye.

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:35.980
Kill 3 days.

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.140
Is this eye dry?

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:39.460
Hand up knife fall

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:40.760
Does this hand cramp?

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:43.760
I said he killed for three days and three nights.

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:45.460
You ask him if his eyes are dry?

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:46.780
Hand up knife fall

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.340
You asked if my hand had cramps?

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:51.740
Uncle.

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:57.060
"Who dares to indulge in my evil cult"...
