00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.600
Pham Hien, when did you start secretly practicing martial arts? Why didn't you tell me?

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:05.880
I don't practice martial arts.

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:07.500
I am just an ordinary person.

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:09.120
I do not believe.

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:10.920
If you don't practice martial arts, how can you pass?

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:11.720
Save Pose.

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:15.720
The leader of the free group thought that I was a person with strong internal strength, so the example was not bright.

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:17.240
While he may doubt me

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:19.300
What is more suspicious is his own mirror.

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:20.460
I am the leader of the Demonic Cult.

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:21.580
I have the guts to find him.

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:22.920
How can there be no internal force?

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.820
I wonder if the owner of the freedom sect will vomit blood after knowing the truth.

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:27.980
I tell you.

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:30.340
This is the power of the brain.

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:31.540
Great huh?

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:33.040
Strong.

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:34.320
So when do we get revenge?

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.620
You have to gather capable people first.

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.680
We'll change into minstrel clothes.

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:39.860
Go to martial arts convention

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.600
If not we will teach you two tricks.

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.000
Fortunately at the martial arts convention on the right

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.840
I can't practice martial arts.

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:46.380
If I could actually practice

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.080
With those martial arts secrets learned, I have long since become a martial arts master.

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:51.420
Why survive like this?

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.720
So if it is a martial arts convention, take the martial arts convention with you.

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.660
Didn't Pham Hien lose?

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.080
This attitude of yours is not right.

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:00.380
If you don't say anything, you'll lose.

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.080
I believe you will be the first.

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:03.900
I believe you too.

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.280
Heaven has a road, you do not go.

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.460
Hell has no entrance
