00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.020
Brothers, the lord comes to save you.

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:08.960
What are you guys doing?

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:10.600
I am here to save you.

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:11.920
You guys keep looking at me like that.

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:13.880
Don't you know the outside is surrounded by the imperial court?

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:15.800
What? This place is surrounded.

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:16.880
I don't want to die.

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.400
If I don't want to die, kill me too.

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:20.260
Say it.

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:22.920
Rebel once, good anti-theft for life.

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.280
Then it's the opposite of Don the boss.

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:25.440
Brothers.

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:26.960
We will kill together now.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:27.920
Everyone listen up.

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:29.560
Don't go, we want to surrender.

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:31.400
But we surrender and still die.

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:34.020
We kill to attack Nam Vuong Dao.

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:43.020
It is you rotten beggars who want to rebel.

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:45.340
Oh, the one with the rabbit got it for me.

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.540
Um, I count three numbers.

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.960
No surrender is cut for you.

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:50.820
Not.

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.800
Two find out I think of a way.

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.280
This positive energy is fake.

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.660
Wait.
