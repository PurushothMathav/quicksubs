You guys are so brave.

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:06.780
Dare to escape prison

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:07.900
Don't be afraid, everyone.

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:09.820
Kill this dog.

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:10.760
Get you out.

The Emperor will forgive you.

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:22.740

How dare you bring yourself into this stinking beggar gang?

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:56.940
Fortunately, Lam Chi Phu arrived in time.

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:00.720
Your Highness, is there any misunderstanding here?

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:04.500
Misunderstand him, this is clearly a thief calling to catch a thief.

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.000
Come on, get him for me.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.500
