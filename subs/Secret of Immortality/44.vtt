00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:05.660
Come on, aren't we selling wheelchairs?

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:06.860
What are you doing here?

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:10.460
Before we made friends, the Taoist told me that Dong Phuong station was for sale.

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.160
We can't sell wheelchairs to them.

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:16.120
But we have 100 people.

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:17.560
Can they buy it all?

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.740
Then we must find the leader of the Eastern Thanh Cang sect to talk.

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:22.120
Go.

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:25.380
Lazy people stop

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.660
First we come to find your boss to talk about cooperation.

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:28.720
They can.

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.180
You can not, we are together.

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:33.200
Sorry. That's the rule.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.500
So you say.

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:35.440
What rules?

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:36.240
Don't let me in.

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:37.520
You are not dressed properly.

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:39.280
We are all noble officials here.

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.740
You are not dressed as beggars should be.

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.300
Dressed sloppily?

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.160
So why can they?

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:46.940
They are women.

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.220
Wait.

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:50.020
Howl.

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:57.420
Hey, why are you making friends here? Daoist Moc Huong said, we meet again after such a short time.

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.120
Why don't you come in?

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:00.560
They said I was not dressed properly.

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:02.080
Don't let me in.

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:03.380
I will take you in.

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:07.140
He can't get in.

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:08.700
He is my friend.

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.380
Okay, but captains need to pay to queue.
