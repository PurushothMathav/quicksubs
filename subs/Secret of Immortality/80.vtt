00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:01.680
Wang.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:02.800
Wang.

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.480
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, look at how he looks like a dog.

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:09.860
Ha ha ha ha

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.260
I beg you to release them.

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.020
You must know

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:16.560
Dogs cannot bargain.

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.220
Remember, you can only save one now.

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:25.540
The last two I just played with you a little.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.080
Do you really think I will do as you want?

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:32.140
Then you can't have a dog that lasts forever.

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:34.960
Anyway, you can't run now.

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:36.860
Have time to torture you

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.100
If you do not choose

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.340
The old man will choose for you.

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:44.060
And you?

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.440
Or do you choose Ms. Chu?

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:49.560
Let him live don't choose me.

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:51.140
Give Ms. Tinh a chance to live

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:52.580
Star?

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:54.980
You still haven't chosen.

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.180
Then I will choose for you.

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:59.000
Help you kill him first.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.260
Stop it.

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:03.380
I got it.

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:09.900
Blue sister Blue sister

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:11.600
HAS.

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:14.080
We will see each other soon.

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:19.060
Pham Hien also handed over another set of Truong Sinh Tuoc, releasing the person first.

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:34.800
why did you save me

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.500
why did you save me

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.780
Why did you choose me?

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:40.420
Ha ha ha

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:44.120
It seems that boss Chu is not very grateful.

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:46.380
We'll push him out first.

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:50.620
don't touch me

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.820
Now I renounce my gratitude to you.

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:56.080
Captain.

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:59.400
I let you go?

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:00.680
I gave you all immortality.

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:02.140
What do you keep me for?

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.500
I must first practice this longevity technique.

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:06.760
If that is true

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.160
Naturally nothing.

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.580
Mostly fake.

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.460
You all must die.

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.380
After the training is completed is the day of your death.
