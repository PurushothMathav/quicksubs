00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:01.740
Demon Master

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:04.020
Reflect what?

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:06.180
What's up?

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:09.540
No, I'm just excited.

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:12.940
Looks like I have to go to the magic church.

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.680
I will go to the Devil's sect with you.

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:17.240
No, I can do it myself.

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:18.500
You think too much.

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.360
I came to the Demonic Cult to look up an old story about Bat Lao village.

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:24.560
If Pham Quang is really an old village

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:26.580
So what was the crime of Nga Mi that year?

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:28.660
I have only you willing to suffer alone.

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.820
Can you tell me more about the old village?

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:37.140
More than 20 years ago, the puppet master To Truong Tung Pham was not worthy of the small piece of fresh meat I arranged for you.

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:38.940
Are you satisfied?

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:42.740
I remember I had no woman.

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.540
Bang Leader, these are the governors of the Emei faction.

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.520
Come here to find me to go to the Demon Sect to do some work.

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.500
The governors have heard a lot.

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:53.680
The leader of the gang is very annoying.

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:55.340
Bang Leader, you just happened to arrive.

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:57.780
Then let's not go over here.

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.500
Bang Chu, I will come visit another day.

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.780
Hey, why are you two in more of a hurry than me?

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.740
What happened to the cult?

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.940
Departure.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.100
Chief Chu has good martial arts.

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.060
why are you here

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.660
You helped the beggars.

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.500
I will help you go to the Devil's sect for a bit.

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.880
Moreover, you do not know martial arts.

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:26.860
If something happens on the way

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.960
Isn't that a hindrance to governors?

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:31.300
Of course.

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.780
And I still don't have you.

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.400
Just let him go.

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:37.940
Am I not at a loss?

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.420
Then you have to listen to me on the way.

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:46.080
Careful.
