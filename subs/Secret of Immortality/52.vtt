00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:01.860
Thank you Mr. Oriental

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:03.780
I will definitely pay this money back.

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:05.760
This is the long string we bought.

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:07.760
The four levels of Jedi training are given to you.

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:09.800
You don't have to be polite.

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:11.640
If you hadn't saved me in the dungeon...

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:14.480
Now I live or die.

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:15.780
Then I am not welcome.

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.580
Later there was a story about a dove flying to spread the book.

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.180
Then don't be here anymore.

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:22.280
Eastern Leadership

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:24.340
Thank you for hosting Master Dong Phuong today.

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.140
Can I have something to do later?

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.780
I didn't expect you to sell out so quickly.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.600
Very potential.

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:36.400
So...

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.340
About joining a magic sect.

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.180
This, take it easy.

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.260
This requires process.

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:56.320
The new person is very knowledgeable.

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:57.580
She teaches very well.

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:59.900
For the sake of your understanding

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:05.020
You will bring this letter to the magic sect headquarters to attend some training first.

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.380
Feel the culture of the magic sect

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.500
Thank you very much.

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.020
If there is nothing then go quickly.

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.360
Oh, there's that old lady again.

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:18.220
I have to go do some good work.

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.120
Go home.

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:22.280
You are highly knowledgeable.

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:23.860
Obviously good silver.

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:25.760
Haven't you heard a word?

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:26.800
The rich man

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.180
No money is difficult.

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.080
Pham Hien said.

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:31.340
I know.

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.020
This is not a real door stop.

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:37.800
I am the owner.

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.220
How much does it cost?

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.380
So next we will kill the Demon Cult.

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:45.540
But before we go, we have to pretend.

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:47.820
When people turn real.

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:50.940
If anyone inside knows me, it will be exposed.
