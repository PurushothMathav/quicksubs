00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:01.180
Tree shaking

00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:02.300
Self assessment

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:04.420
If it is my plot

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:08.240
So do you know where the elixir of life is now?

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:10.940
He will not take my elixir of life.

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.720
Ha ha ha.

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:15.600
Sorry.

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.460
I don't usually smile.

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.420
Unless you can't stand.

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:24.300
Ha ha ha ha ha ha I'll deal with them later, I'll see how you can laugh.

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:27.500
Okay, I'm not laughing anymore.

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:28.580
Keep going.

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.300
I will let you die now.

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:39.060
How is that possible?

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.120
I am the one who drank the elixir of life.

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.140
And when taking the elixir of life, do you smell urine?

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.620
Is there a fire bath?

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.180
You were tampered with by the Longevity Medicine.

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.300
How did you know it would fall into my hands?

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.500
I do not know.

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.660
Anyway, when I got caught at the empty gate when I was on drugs.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.580
I added something inside.

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:03.740
When my men go robbing

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:05.240
why don't you stop

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:06.780
You don't give me a chance.

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:08.900
I really do not accept.

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.020
It is right to be unwilling.

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.420
Except for the sixth level of the Longevity Sparrow at your puppet door.

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.340
Everything else is in my hands.

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:18.440
Even the seventh floor I have.

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:20.080
Too bad you can't hear.

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:21.820
I haven't stabbed you in the heart yet.

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:23.060
you will die

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.460
Can mind, so cheap, he died like that.

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.140
Hello Pham Hien.

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:29.840
I feel strange.

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.420
Look, why is it so quiet around?

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.520
Ha ha ha, all attacked.

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.500
Even if the Jedi foundation is above you on the Great Wall
