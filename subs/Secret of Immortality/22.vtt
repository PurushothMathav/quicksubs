00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.340
Wait, he's fake.

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:07.320
Tell your men to let my brothers go, I will spare you.

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:08.600
Then don't blame me.

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:09.700
Landlord Duong Don't

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:14.060
Don't move.

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:15.080
We want to be hired.

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:17.320
No reaction haha

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:20.420
Recruiting you guys still doesn't have this qualification.

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.060
Someone killed them all.

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:25.700
Magic leaves cut into silk.

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:27.860
For saving my life.

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.700
I will spare your life.

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:31.780
Don't listen to him.

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.300
He is the fake King of South.

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:34.640
Am I right?

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.900
Lord of the Road haha

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.320
Don't mess with the king.

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.760
From now on, I cannot live without your benefits.

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.020
If it weren't for her spying in the Beg' Gang.

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.380
How can I catch all the beggars?

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.380
It turned out that he had proposed a reform plan.

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:50.680
Just tricked us into coming here.

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:51.920
Pham Huyen, you bastard.

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:52.880
You cannot die.

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:55.280
Pham Hien, even if I were a ghost, I would not let you off.

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:56.780
Yes, yes.

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.940
Pham Hien is definitely not a spy.

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:03.680
Hurry up!

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.740
I will kill you today.
