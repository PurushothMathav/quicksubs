00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:02.440
That's scary.

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:03.920
Is this a ghost?

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:05.300
What happened?

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:06.980
Ha ha ha

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.540
If you want to live, quickly hand over the Truong Sinh Tuoc's cultivation method.

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.360
I can spare your life.

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:15.720
You die this heart.

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:16.840
I won't give it to you.

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:19.860
kill me

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:21.820
You think too simple.

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.200
I will slowly kill the people around you.

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:28.560
Have you forgotten that there are other survivors in Brown Village?

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.980
Aren't those two your soul mates?

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:34.840
Killing them doesn't hurt you?

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.100
You think too much.

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:37.900
I just use them.

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.300
Whether I die or not is none of my business.

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.320
That year, their sect also could not handle the relationship.

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.780
Is that really true?

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:46.980
If you don't believe it, do it.

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.600
I'm kidding you.

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.020
Still so excited?

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:05.700
Then hand over your immortality.

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.980
Release people.

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.320
Tell me, who do you want to save?

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:19.340
Impossible.

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:21.660
I will die with them.

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.700
If you want to save...

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.460
kneel down and beg me.

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.180
Are not!

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.400
Please release them all.

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.060
The sound is too low to hear.

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.080
I beg you to let them go.

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:38.380
What are you doing so big?

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:40.500
Do you think old Phuong is deaf?

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.820
I beg you to release them all.

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:45.380
You say it.

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.300
Is that my dog?

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.100
Yeah, so you bark two dog barks.

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:00.860
I will release you.

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:05.660
Don't you want to save their lives?
