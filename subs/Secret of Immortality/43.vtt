00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.360
This is without compensation.

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:05.480
It seems your ideological awareness is still a bit low.

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:08.820
What should a good person learn to contribute?

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.260
Now giving you this opportunity is your luck.

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:14.700
You must know how to appreciate

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:15.820
If not paid

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:17.260
Do not work for the devil.

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.760
I have never seen the reward of the Demon Sect.

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:21.540
As long as I can work here.

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.600
I feel very happy.

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.820
And young people like you, don't always think about salary.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.840
If you think about what you can bring to the Demonic Cult.

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:34.160
What can you learn from the Devil's Cult?

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.040
Know how to give

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:37.140
Dedication

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:39.900
You here is a strong argument.

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.920
I know people are doubting me.

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.700
I understand you too, but you will understand me later.

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:50.240
Jealous of me, even want to surpass me.

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:52.120
Okay, here's our enlightenment machine.

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:53.820
We still have to learn from you.

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.600
Study, study a lot.

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.800
Learn to live with your hands.

00:00:58.800 --> 00:00:59.640
Not a moment too soon.

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.720
So let's sell wheelchairs first.

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:03.420
Try your best

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.100
Come on.
