00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.640
I know most people don't want to rebel these days.

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:03.660
But that's okay.

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:05.960
We have formed a reform group.

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:08.740
Now please invite Pham Hien to speak for everyone.

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:10.840
Who is this person?

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:13.240
I don't know if it's Ms. Lanh's person.

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:14.440
Should be trusted

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:17.160
I won't introduce myself anymore.

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.780
You guys don't know me anyway, go straight to the dry goods.

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:21.340
What about the reformers?

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.880
First of all, reform in the field of disciples of the Beg Sect.

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.600
Let every disciple of the Beg Sect be paid regularly.

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.980
Resting couple Han Xin working to care for the elderly

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:30.900
Help pay half the medical examination

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:32.060
Individual pays half

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.060
Oh, this. Yes.

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.040
Organize brothel tours during the time

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:38.800
So that each disciple of the Sect has food and drink.

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:39.720
Have money to go to the doctor

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:40.880
Age

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:42.800
Alright.

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.860
Any problems please feel free to ask anytime

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.680
Why not?

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:49.400
Increase treatment

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:50.560
Make Duong Lam uninhabited.

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:51.880
Can also absorb new disciples.

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:53.040
Not once?

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.000
Hey, Mr. Pham.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.260
I have a question.

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.960
You talk so much it's really attractive.

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.720
But how does this money come, tell you guys who want money.

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:03.480
Can't say want

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.280
Want to say reward talent

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.840
If you can sing, then sing.

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.400
Fracture of large stone in chest

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.160
It's okay to not have talent.

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:11.320
Man may not live

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:12.760
But can not live

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:15.720
Oh, all this is treatment, what is there to oppose?

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:16.600
All this treatment already.

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:17.580
What else is there to create?

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.480
Okay, the officer is here.

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:24.480
We do not rebel.

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:25.120
We surrender.

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:26.860
What about surrender?

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:27.880
You continue to rebel.

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:29.180
Just pretend we never came.

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:30.440
If you do not rebel

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:31.820
What do we use to start a career?

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.560
How you open a new page in your family tree is up to you.

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.400
Assured.

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:37.800
Isn't this forcing us to rebel?

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.060
Don't panic, feel something is wrong.

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:41.300
let me think
