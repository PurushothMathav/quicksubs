00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:04.580
Miss Chu Man, here I come.

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:07.400
HAS.

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:10.220
This person has clear eyes.

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:11.940
Looks childish.

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:13.660
Then it's easy to do.

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.080
Your Highness, you are late.

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.060
Leader Chu is my wife now.

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:22.360
Alright.

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:23.480
Bold

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.380
How dare you take revenge on me like this?

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:27.660
YES.

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:31.120
A prince cannot have two husbands for one woman.

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:32.680
Can't you think strongly?

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.500
Can't the King be reasonable?

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.360
That king killed you.

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:40.080
Turn Boss Chu into a Widow

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:44.100
Hey, hey, what the people below thought of you that day and the day after, I don't know.

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:46.620
What if the emperor knows?

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:50.740
So you name the price.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:52.860
Royal family.

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.500
Why don't you fight me?

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:57.280
I lose.

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:58.980
He is a widow.

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:02.060
If I win, it's as if the King never came.

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:03.900
Win or lose

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.060
It doesn't take away from a good conversation to spread it around.

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.420
Better is better, but better is my decision.
