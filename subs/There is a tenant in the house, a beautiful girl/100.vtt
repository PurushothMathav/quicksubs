00:00:01.133 --> 00:00:01.966
set off

2
00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:06.833
Actually I have something to say to you

3
00:00:08.066 --> 00:00:09.500
Thanks very much.

4
00:00:09.666 --> 00:00:11.100
You have helped me so much.

5
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:13.066
And solved so much trouble for me

6
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:15.566
I didn't expect you to be so good

7
00:00:15.566 --> 00:00:16.433
i

8
00:00:17.466 --> 00:00:18.900
There's no need to be polite with me.

9
00:00:18.966 --> 00:00:20.000
Who let us

10
00:00:20.866 --> 00:00:22.100
What happened to us?

11
00:00:22.866 --> 00:00:25.300
Just pretend to be boyfriend and girlfriend?

12
00:00:25.366 --> 00:00:28.166
I also did what a boyfriend should do

13
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:29.866
Thanks very much.

14
00:00:29.866 --> 00:00:32.433
I'm not done with your kindness

15
00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.833
If only that hadn't happened

16
00:00:36.866 --> 00:00:38.266
I can

17
00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.200
If you really want to thank me

18
00:00:42.866 --> 00:00:44.433
You can also use other methods.

19
00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:46.833
How?

20
00:00:47.766 --> 00:00:49.033
fake it

21
00:00:51.466 --> 00:00:54.433
Chu Feng, I really like you

22
00:00:54.566 --> 00:00:56.366
But I can't be with you

23
00:00:56.466 --> 00:00:58.266
I was designed by ace

24
00:00:59.766 --> 00:01:01.800
I broke into another man's room

25
00:01:01.866 --> 00:01:05.066
Then go sorry

26
00:01:12.566 --> 00:01:14.300
Is there a feeling of deja vu?

27
00:01:16.066 --> 00:01:17.100
It's You

28
00:01:17.966 --> 00:01:20.800
In fact, I already knew it was you

29
00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.800
It's just that there is no way to face it

30
00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.100
I want to do that

31
00:01:26.866 --> 00:01:28.166
You don't owe me anything

32
00:01:28.866 --> 00:01:30.100
As long as you want

33
00:01:30.566 --> 00:01:31.966
I can be your decency anytime

34
00:01:33.733 --> 00:01:36.033
I don't want the beauty you think.

35
00:01:36.666 --> 00:01:38.600
Then Miss Lin has to think about it.

36
00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.700
My radish is more popular.

37
00:01:40.766 --> 00:01:43.233
After this village, there is no such store

38
00:01:43.733 --> 00:01:45.233
You are so stingy

39
00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:46.400
Who wants you?

40
00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:47.266
I want you.

41
00:01:47.533 --> 00:01:48.466
He's mine.

42
00:01:48.466 --> 00:01:50.433
No, the streamer is mine.

43
00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.800
Get out of the way, streamer.

44
00:01:53.066 --> 00:01:55.066
The streamer, the streamer is mine.

45
00:01:55.066 --> 00:01:57.466
Hey, don't pull my streamer away.
