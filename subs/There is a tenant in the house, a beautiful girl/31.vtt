00:00:03.366 --> 00:00:05.400
What nonsense is the kitchen talking about?

2
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:06.466
How can I have it?

3
00:00:06.466 --> 00:00:08.133
Miss Song, really

4
00:00:08.133 --> 00:00:10.766
If you have the real thing, take it out and show it to everyone

5
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.566
Let them have long eyes and die

6
00:00:13.566 --> 00:00:16.900
Hmph boy, I know Qingwan best

7
00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.066
It wouldn't be so if he really had

8
00:00:20.533 --> 00:00:23.200
Are you a 43-year-old child?

9
00:00:24.266 --> 00:00:26.566
You are trying to be strong

10
00:00:26.733 --> 00:00:28.400
I'll give you a chance.

11
00:00:28.566 --> 00:00:31.166
You give me 28 million

12
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.866
If you take it out, I won't care about you

13
00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:35.700
Oh, Mr. Liu

14
00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.966
Some people are just laymen and want to pretend

15
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Don't make it difficult for him

16
00:00:41.166 --> 00:00:43.266
Don't say 28 million

17
00:00:43.466 --> 00:00:45.600
That's 2,800 bucks

18
00:00:45.966 --> 00:00:47.566
He can't take it out either

19
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.366
Hey, Chu Feng, stop making trouble, okay?

20
00:00:50.366 --> 00:00:51.800
You don't believe me either.

21
00:00:52.066 --> 00:00:53.833
Since no one believes it

22
00:00:53.866 --> 00:00:57.433
I had to prove it with facts

23
00:00:57.933 --> 00:00:59.966
If you can take it out

24
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.966
I, Liu Xiong, ate this sentence

25
00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:05.700
Wait a moment.

26
00:01:13.666 --> 00:01:15.200
Chu Feng, what are you doing?

27
00:01:15.566 --> 00:01:18.633
Although you are my windbreak, you can't do this

28
00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.000
Hey, what the hell are you doing?

29
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.100
That seems to be the only way to go now.

30
00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.466
That's Yun Mengxian's words

31
00:01:27.466 --> 00:01:29.566
It's not something that anyone can imitate if they want to.

32
00:01:29.566 --> 00:01:30.933
Besides, I like that guy more than I do

33
00:01:30.933 --> 00:01:32.666
I know I'm definitely going to take this out of the car

34
00:01:32.666 --> 00:01:33.966
Isn't that the end?

35
00:01:33.966 --> 00:01:37.000
And for your bookish children

36
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.033
They can all see it.

37
00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:40.900
Graduated Coco Lie

38
00:01:41.366 --> 00:01:42.266
No no

39
00:01:42.466 --> 00:01:45.100
Why don't I solve it?

40
00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:47.200
immediately
