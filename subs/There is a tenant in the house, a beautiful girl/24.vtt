00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:02.700
What do you mean?

2
00:00:02.866 --> 00:00:03.900
How is that possible?

3
00:00:04.133 --> 00:00:05.700
I'm not talking nonsense.

4
00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.033
After all, Sister Luoyang, you said it before

5
00:00:08.166 --> 00:00:09.400
Your girl?

6
00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:11.900
I will definitely surpass you in medical skills

7
00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:13.433
Isn't it here now?

8
00:00:13.666 --> 00:00:16.900
What senior sister actually said such a thing?

9
00:00:16.933 --> 00:00:17.966
Ouch no

10
00:00:17.966 --> 00:00:19.600
I can't be found by him

11
00:00:21.866 --> 00:00:22.566
Hey

12
00:00:22.566 --> 00:00:24.866
I'm here today to tell you the good news.

13
00:00:24.866 --> 00:00:25.766
Uh-huh.

14
00:00:25.966 --> 00:00:26.966
I have something to do in the hospital

15
00:00:26.966 --> 00:00:30.600
I'll pack my things first. Um, bye-bye.

16
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.200
It's over, I shouldn't be exposed, right?

17
00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:36.366
Small pestle

18
00:00:36.366 --> 00:00:39.666
This girl, I am happy to give you two hundred yuan today.

19
00:00:39.733 --> 00:00:42.466
How about hiring you to go out with my sister tomorrow?

20
00:00:42.966 --> 00:00:45.500
Two hundred yuan to accompany you out

21
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
I'm not that cheap

22
00:00:48.166 --> 00:00:50.500
Why is 200 too little?

23
00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:51.766
Add fifty to you

24
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.000
I don't want you.

25
00:00:54.733 --> 00:00:57.700
I didn't mean to ask me, I said to give you two hundred

26
00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.966
Hey, no, Chu Feng, you scold me, hum

27
00:01:03.866 --> 00:01:06.566
Hmm, this dead girl movie

28
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:10.633
Grandpa

29
00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:13.966
The matter of the Lin family has been resolved

30
00:01:14.133 --> 00:01:15.266
I am also ready

31
00:01:15.266 --> 00:01:17.500
Resign as interim group general manager

32
00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:19.766
Why did you call me back?

33
00:01:19.766 --> 00:01:23.166
Who told you it was solved?

34
00:01:23.166 --> 00:01:25.000
You solve shit

35
00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.433
You showed me what this is

36
00:01:28.666 --> 00:01:31.900
This is the splash that the surnamed Chu brought over

37
00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.366
You are still colluding with the surname Chu

38
00:01:34.366 --> 00:01:36.200
Destroy the relationship between the Lin Kings

39
00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:39.333
Fortunately, Wang Shao is magnanimous

40
00:01:39.333 --> 00:01:41.133
My old man came to the door himself

41
00:01:41.133 --> 00:01:43.100
I forgave the Lin family's offense

42
00:01:43.533 --> 00:01:47.366
And I checked the person surnamed Chu

43
00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.166
Sister, you don't know

44
00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:54.366
That person surnamed Chu is not only not a big shot

45
00:01:54.366 --> 00:01:55.766
Still a farmer

46
00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.766
Wang Shao sent someone to check him out yesterday

47
00:01:58.766 --> 00:02:00.333
Are you still stubborn?

48
00:02:00.333 --> 00:02:01.466
So what?

49
00:02:02.166 --> 00:02:04.266
No matter what kind of person Chu Feng is

50
00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:06.233
What is his gift?

51
00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.366
He is my chosen one

52
00:02:08.466 --> 00:02:09.866
I would never leave him.

53
00:02:09.866 --> 00:02:12.600
You are even less likely to be with Wang Fan

54
00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.966
Shut up and kneel for me
