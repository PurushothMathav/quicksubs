00:00:04.366 --> 00:00:05.200
Wake up

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:06.700

3
00:00:07.133 --> 00:00:08.700
Why am I here?

4
00:00:09.733 --> 00:00:11.033
What are you doing here?

5
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:12.800
I said miss

6
00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:14.866
I really struggled with my old nose

7
00:00:14.866 --> 00:00:16.233
Just got you here

8
00:00:16.333 --> 00:00:18.466
There's no one at home and I don't have the key

9
00:00:18.533 --> 00:00:20.966
It's good that I didn't put you on the street

10
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:24.933
I remember now.

11
00:00:24.933 --> 00:00:26.700
I was drugged.

12
00:00:27.066 --> 00:00:29.500
Dazed and called you

13
00:00:30.533 --> 00:00:31.866
You saved me.

14
00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:33.233
Good to know

15
00:00:33.333 --> 00:00:34.200
Give it

16
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.900
What are you doing?

17
00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:38.400
I saved you.

18
00:00:38.766 --> 00:00:41.800
Taxi fare, I got you here labor costs

19
00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.633
And the medical bills for your slap on my face

20
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.966
500 in total. Cash or credit card?

21
00:00:46.966 --> 00:00:49.300
I have no money, no money

22
00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.266
Deliver it to the rent then

23
00:00:51.666 --> 00:00:54.600
Why are you like this, ACHOO?

24
00:00:56.666 --> 00:00:59.500
Okay, you sit here, I'll go buy some medicine

25
00:00:59.566 --> 00:01:01.433
After drinking the medicine, go home together.

26
00:01:10.733 --> 00:01:12.266
Hello sir, it's Chen Yiyi.

27
00:01:12.366 --> 00:01:13.866
Back in the mountains

28
00:01:13.866 --> 00:01:16.066
Or did the master make me a guitar?

29
00:01:16.266 --> 00:01:17.866
Haven't touched it in so many years

30
00:01:17.933 --> 00:01:20.066
Uh, I'll give you 20 for me to sing

31
00:01:20.466 --> 00:01:22.633
Ok sir hello

32
00:01:39.966 --> 00:01:41.833
The road experiences rain and frost

33
00:01:44.066 --> 00:01:47.200
Stinky rascal stingy man

34
00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:49.500
Why haven't you come back?

35
00:01:53.766 --> 00:01:55.833
Who is singing?

36
00:01:56.766 --> 00:01:59.166
Thank you Mr. West Wind for singing

37
00:02:00.166 --> 00:02:02.400
The west wind is the west wind

38
00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.600
Oops.

39
00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:08.866
Ah, what's going on?

40
00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.200
West wind west wind west wind
