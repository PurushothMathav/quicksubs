00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:02.800
What do you say sorry sir

2
00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:05.100
My friend, he's always out of tune

3
00:00:05.166 --> 00:00:06.766
He's just talking casually

4
00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:09.666
Autumn, this guy is outspoken

5
00:00:09.733 --> 00:00:10.900
You said that to me last time

6
00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:13.000
This time I'm talking about Qinghe again

7
00:00:13.533 --> 00:00:16.300
I will teach him a lesson today

8
00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:17.566
Teach me a lesson

9
00:00:18.133 --> 00:00:19.266
You are not qualified

10
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.033
Humph boy

11
00:00:22.266 --> 00:00:25.400
Are you just going to benefit from words?

12
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.166
Do you still need Ambassador Qinghe to teach you a lesson?

13
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.866
I can make you disappear with one call

14
00:00:30.933 --> 00:00:33.433
Brother Liu, he is my friend

15
00:00:33.466 --> 00:00:35.100
Kiss you don't worry

16
00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.000
This kind of person?

17
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.800
It's not worth me fighting him

18
00:00:39.466 --> 00:00:40.366
In my eyes?

19
00:00:40.366 --> 00:00:41.533
Only paintings

20
00:00:41.533 --> 00:00:44.433
Going against this kind of person will only lower my worth

21
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:45.500
Yo

22
00:00:46.466 --> 00:00:49.800
Are you saying that painters are more precious than others?

23
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.000
Then according to you

24
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.466
Isn't the number one painter on the list the most noble?

25
00:00:54.466 --> 00:00:56.466
Hmph, that's natural

26
00:00:57.466 --> 00:00:59.200
Not like you

27
00:00:59.266 --> 00:01:02.300
You can only be a bumpkin for the rest of your life

28
00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:03.900
Hey, Mr. Liu

29
00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:06.233
I see Song Xiaojie

30
00:01:06.666 --> 00:01:08.933
Have you ever wanted to learn from the palace?

31
00:01:08.933 --> 00:01:09.966
I'm leaving first.

32
00:01:09.966 --> 00:01:11.100
Master Qinghe

33
00:01:11.533 --> 00:01:14.633
Okay, I can't learn anything from this

34
00:01:14.666 --> 00:01:15.633
It's all my education

35
00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.600
Humph boy

36
00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.733
What did you say?

37
00:01:19.733 --> 00:01:21.000
You can draw?

38
00:01:21.333 --> 00:01:23.300
If you could draw

39
00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:24.833
Then I'm a painter

40
00:01:25.366 --> 00:01:27.566
Who told you I can't draw?

41
00:01:27.966 --> 00:01:31.700
Okay, okay, you still put on with me

42
00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:34.000
Then let's compare

43
00:01:34.166 --> 00:01:37.466
Whoever loses is lying on the ground learning to bark

44
00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.433
You are not qualified with me

45
00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:42.266
Let's be a thief
