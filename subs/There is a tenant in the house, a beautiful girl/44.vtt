00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:01.233
What is me

2
00:00:01.933 --> 00:00:03.433
Why are you pretending

3
00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:06.166
Aren't you Brother West Wind?

4
00:00:06.166 --> 00:00:09.000
Ah, how could I be the west wind?

5
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:09.900
I have no money

6
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.900
No money yet, right?

7
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.600
I have no money to support you.

8
00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:16.066
What do you want?

9
00:00:16.333 --> 00:00:19.900
You are here, I am you, you are what you are

10
00:00:20.366 --> 00:00:21.600
I called someone

11
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.066
Is that right? Then you shout

12
00:00:24.066 --> 00:00:27.500
Anyway, there are only the two of us in the house today.

13
00:00:27.733 --> 00:00:30.000
You scream your throat and no one comes to save you

14
00:00:31.666 --> 00:00:33.100
I am a cell, I confess.

15
00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.166
Then why are you helping me?

16
00:00:35.366 --> 00:00:38.133
Don't I see that my uncle is seriously ill?

17
00:00:38.133 --> 00:00:40.400
So I want to help you, right?

18
00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.500
Why do I think you are interested in me?

19
00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.000
How is that possible?

20
00:00:44.066 --> 00:00:46.766
I don't believe you don't mean me

21
00:00:46.966 --> 00:00:48.600
I really don't have it.

22
00:00:49.133 --> 00:00:51.400
Then I'd like to see if it's true

23
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:52.600
What do you want?

24
00:00:53.066 --> 00:00:56.000
Of course I'm going to the toilet

25
00:00:58.933 --> 00:01:03.200
Come to my kitchen, dead kitchen, come, come, have a drink!

26
00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.200
You drink

27
00:01:05.566 --> 00:01:06.966
OK

28
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.333
Oops, drink well?

29
00:01:10.333 --> 00:01:13.666
It tastes good. Have another drink. How about this wine?

30
00:01:13.666 --> 00:01:15.266
Hahahaha

31
00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:20.700
Brother Liu, come and drink together, hahaha.

32
00:01:20.933 --> 00:01:22.966
Go out first hahaha

33
00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:26.966
Ahahaha Wang Shao

34
00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.266
Why didn't you see your lady next door today?

35
00:01:30.266 --> 00:01:31.933
Instead, he remembered me

36
00:01:31.933 --> 00:01:33.800
Well, miss

37
00:01:33.966 --> 00:01:38.066
I got messed up by a hillbilly

38
00:01:38.933 --> 00:01:41.300
How is your painter?

39
00:01:41.333 --> 00:01:43.266
Oops don't mention it

40
00:01:43.266 --> 00:01:46.400
Failed to get caught up in it by a guy

41
00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.766
Hey, Wang Shao, but your idea is really okay

42
00:01:49.866 --> 00:01:52.100
Hahahahaha, right?

43
00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:55.066
I actually have another sentence

44
00:01:55.333 --> 00:01:57.600
You go out and find a master

45
00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.366
You just need to let the master

46
00:01:59.366 --> 00:02:01.500
Let the kiss bowl go to the teacher

47
00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:02.900
This is once worshiped by the teacher

48
00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.266
Can't you do whatever you want?

49
00:02:05.266 --> 00:02:07.300
Hey, it's really Wang Shou

50
00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:08.966
Hahaha, come to respect you, come to respect you

51
00:02:08.966 --> 00:02:10.333
Come and go one

52
00:02:10.333 --> 00:02:11.300
Oops um

53
00:02:12.366 --> 00:02:15.533
Oops, oops, how did you let the beauty go?

54
00:02:15.533 --> 00:02:17.566
Come and come again come and come

55
00:02:17.566 --> 00:02:20.600
Let's play with these little apples together.
