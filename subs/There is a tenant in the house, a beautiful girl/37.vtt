00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:02.266
Hahaha, get up for me.

2
00:00:02.333 --> 00:00:05.066
Stay calm and find your promise, Xiuxiu

3
00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:06.400
Then the surgery failed

4
00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:09.433
Mine is obviously four times, right?

5
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.233
Shut up who said the surgery failed

6
00:00:12.466 --> 00:00:14.333
The patient was obviously in serious condition

7
00:00:14.333 --> 00:00:15.433
Do I have a question?

8
00:00:15.533 --> 00:00:18.033
Hurry up and solve it, deal with it, and go out with me.

9
00:00:28.166 --> 00:00:29.533
Oh, I said don't turn around, miss

10
00:00:29.533 --> 00:00:30.766
My head hurts

11
00:00:30.766 --> 00:00:32.633
Let's calm down and don't worry.

12
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.566
That's my dad

13
00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.700
That's my only relative

14
00:00:36.733 --> 00:00:39.633
What should I do if he has three long and two short?

15
00:00:49.066 --> 00:00:50.633
What am I afraid of going to the doctor?

16
00:00:50.933 --> 00:00:51.900
This lady

17
00:00:52.166 --> 00:00:53.166
I'm so sorry.

18
00:00:53.533 --> 00:00:56.233
Your father's condition is too serious

19
00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:58.166
Lack of hope

20
00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:00.100
But don't worry.

21
00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:01.700
Doctor Gao

22
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.966
I've done my best to help you pay for the surgery

23
00:01:05.466 --> 00:01:09.500
I promise I'll wake up and see you for the last time.

24
00:01:09.766 --> 00:01:12.600
Why are you laughing at me? You don't see each other.

25
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:13.600
Come and help me

26
00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.766
Silly, you've been sitting here making trouble since just now

27
00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.500
This is a hospital.

28
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:19.833
I can't let you be presumptuous

29
00:01:20.133 --> 00:01:23.000
How can I not be able to have a temper?

30
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.966
Weren't you responsible for the patient just now?

31
00:01:24.966 --> 00:01:26.566
Why don't you mention it now?

32
00:01:26.566 --> 00:01:28.433
Enough boy

33
00:01:29.133 --> 00:01:31.266
When is it about healing and saving people?

34
00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:33.100
It's your turn to point fingers

35
00:01:33.366 --> 00:01:34.466
Get out of here!

36
00:01:34.466 --> 00:01:36.900
Yo, pissed off, right?

37
00:01:37.366 --> 00:01:39.966
If you don't have the ability, stay wherever it's cool

38
00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:41.900
Sister, go in

39
00:01:42.066 --> 00:01:42.866
Stop

40
00:01:43.266 --> 00:01:45.033
I'll see which of you dares to go in
