00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:02.166
Dad, I just told you

2
00:00:02.166 --> 00:00:03.566
Mr. Chu is very powerful

3
00:00:03.566 --> 00:00:06.233
Why are you pretending to be Mr. Chu?

4
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:09.966
Where did the nonsense old man get his son?

5
00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:11.600
Don't scream at me

6
00:00:12.566 --> 00:00:14.966
Dad, what are you doing?

7
00:00:15.333 --> 00:00:16.233
Master Wu

8
00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:20.166
Are you mistaken? This is not Ling Zun.

9
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:21.866
No, it's impossible.

10
00:00:21.866 --> 00:00:23.266
How could I possibly be wrong?

11
00:00:23.466 --> 00:00:25.633
My dad said he had a scar on his wrist

12
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.100
It was accidentally injured by engraving before.

13
00:00:34.133 --> 00:00:36.700
Shut up useless thing

14
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.100
You messed up my plan

15
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.566
Dad, why are you impersonating Mr. Chu?

16
00:00:44.666 --> 00:00:46.566
It's not for your sister-in-law

17
00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:48.166
An old age

18
00:00:48.166 --> 00:00:51.200
I can't even find a wife

19
00:00:51.366 --> 00:00:53.966
Of course I have to come out and cheat you how much money?

20
00:00:53.966 --> 00:00:57.866
Otherwise, I will not be able to hold my grandson in my next life

21
00:00:59.066 --> 00:01:01.733
This kid grew up in the mountains

22
00:01:01.733 --> 00:01:03.500
I've already asked around.

23
00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:04.800
Nobody knew him.

24
00:01:05.333 --> 00:01:09.866
I have to take this opportunity to cheat some money

25
00:01:10.133 --> 00:01:11.900
Who knew it was such a coincidence?

26
00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:13.766
I ran into this kid

27
00:01:13.766 --> 00:01:16.333
Dad, don't worry about me

28
00:01:16.333 --> 00:01:18.833
Now you can apologize to Mr. Chu

29
00:01:19.133 --> 00:01:20.366
No need, Master Wu

30
00:01:20.733 --> 00:01:21.933
Uh, what about Ling Zun?

31
00:01:21.933 --> 00:01:23.100
I'll send it back to you later.

32
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.466
Are you worried?

33
00:01:26.066 --> 00:01:27.900
Then thank you Mr. Chu

34
00:01:28.766 --> 00:01:31.200
Old Wu, what do you have to say now?

35
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.033
Old man, I admit it

36
00:01:33.133 --> 00:01:34.666
What can you do to me?

37
00:01:35.366 --> 00:01:37.966
Tell you how old I am

38
00:01:38.066 --> 00:01:39.833
How dare you touch me?

39
00:01:39.933 --> 00:01:41.866
I can lie down

40
00:01:41.866 --> 00:01:43.666
Don't worry, I won't touch you.

41
00:01:43.666 --> 00:01:46.266
But you are so deceiving

42
00:01:46.466 --> 00:01:47.900
Others can't tell.

43
00:01:48.933 --> 00:01:50.966
You old thing!

44
00:01:51.466 --> 00:01:52.933
Dare to fucking lie to me

45
00:01:52.933 --> 00:01:54.433
I won't let you
