00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:01.966
Uncle, are you alright?

2
00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:03.600
Okay, don't worry.

3
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:04.666
I'm fine.

4
00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:07.000
Thank you for today

5
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.266
Otherwise, I don't know what to do, little sister

6
00:00:10.766 --> 00:00:12.466
I just heard that Wang Fan

7
00:00:12.533 --> 00:00:14.100
Bringing up the debt of your Lin family again

8
00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:16.500
I gave your Lin family so many gifts at that time

9
00:00:16.866 --> 00:00:19.200
Selling two at random is enough to pay back the money.

10
00:00:19.333 --> 00:00:21.766
None of those

11
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.200
No.

12
00:00:23.766 --> 00:00:24.166
Oh.

13
00:00:24.166 --> 00:00:26.333
Are your neighbors so generous now?

14
00:00:26.333 --> 00:00:28.633
The 80 million was spent so quickly

15
00:00:28.733 --> 00:00:30.266
It's not spent.

16
00:00:30.333 --> 00:00:33.500
It was my grandpa who thought you gave those things

17
00:00:33.733 --> 00:00:35.133
It's all fake.

18
00:00:35.133 --> 00:00:36.966
So he had it set on fire.

19
00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:40.833
Burn

20
00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.400
That's my father's hard-earned money

21
00:00:46.333 --> 00:00:47.666
I finally made up my mind

22
00:00:47.666 --> 00:00:49.000
Help your Lin family

23
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:50.766
Just burned

24
00:00:51.366 --> 00:00:53.266
Then my favorite culture is gone

25
00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.466
Chu Feng these things

26
00:00:57.466 --> 00:01:00.033
I will find a way to pay you back in the future.

27
00:01:00.166 --> 00:01:04.633
Now Mr. wants to win the order of the four major families?

28
00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.033
Four big families

29
00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.000
The four great families will come here in the fire of a day

30
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.266
Then they will hold a delicate feast

31
00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.566
Select a suitable family for cooperation there

32
00:01:15.566 --> 00:01:17.166
And send tens of billions of orders

33
00:01:17.166 --> 00:01:18.666
It came quickly

34
00:01:18.933 --> 00:01:20.500
But it's a pity

35
00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:22.800
What a pity

36
00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.066
I gave that to your neighbor at that time.

37
00:01:25.066 --> 00:01:26.166
Order for Linglong Banquet

38
00:01:26.166 --> 00:01:27.400
Hold it perfectly

39
00:01:29.333 --> 00:01:32.266
Chu Feng, your joke is not funny at all

40
00:01:33.166 --> 00:01:34.600
Shishi I believe

41
00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.166
You will definitely get that 10 billion order.

42
00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.000
It's just the size of our neighborhood.

43
00:01:39.266 --> 00:01:40.966
Not eligible for membership

44
00:01:41.166 --> 00:01:44.033
I have to think about the invitation letter again

45
00:01:44.466 --> 00:01:46.766
Otherwise it's all talk

46
00:01:46.766 --> 00:01:48.100
Isn't it just an invitation?

47
00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:49.366
Believe it or not, a phone call

48
00:01:49.366 --> 00:01:50.766
Just have them deliver it to you.

49
00:01:51.666 --> 00:01:53.300
Stop bragging.

50
00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.200
Still don't seem to believe me
