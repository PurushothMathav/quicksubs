00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.000
What's the matter with you guys?

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.466
Is it that hard for you to arrange a new accommodation?

3
00:00:04.466 --> 00:00:06.566
It's not that the young woman is not arranged by us.

4
00:00:06.566 --> 00:00:08.500
How many times has the young lady told you?

5
00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:09.900
That's not a young woman

6
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.433
I'm his landlord.

7
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.633
Boyfriends and roommates are fake

8
00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:15.033
The young master is right

9
00:00:15.166 --> 00:00:17.366
Nothing happened with the pants

10
00:00:17.566 --> 00:00:19.566
The young master has compensated 100 billion anyway

11
00:00:19.566 --> 00:00:21.400
Hahaha old money

12
00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:22.900
What did you just say?

13
00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:26.266
Uh, young Zhuang, you and young lady?

14
00:00:26.266 --> 00:00:28.866
It's not about you and the Lin family, we all know

15
00:00:28.866 --> 00:00:30.900
We even know the room number

16
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.100
Haha, how do you know?

17
00:00:33.266 --> 00:00:34.066
Shao Fu

18
00:00:34.066 --> 00:00:36.966
There is nothing you don't know about the difficulties of the four major families

19
00:00:37.066 --> 00:00:40.466
Hahaha, you have to believe me.

20
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.466
This young master is not such a person

21
00:00:42.466 --> 00:00:45.466
I just think there's a lot of charm out there

22
00:00:48.133 --> 00:00:49.866
Good times are waiting for me

23
00:00:49.866 --> 00:00:51.100
Hahahaha

24
00:00:52.366 --> 00:00:54.466
Hahahaha

25
00:00:57.933 --> 00:00:58.733
Hello?

26
00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:02.633
Pardon me?

27
00:01:03.766 --> 00:01:05.600
If they get hurt a little bit

28
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.000
You're dead.

29
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.766
What happened to the owner?

30
00:01:11.133 --> 00:01:13.500
Wang Fan jumped over the wall and kidnapped the teacher and the others

31
00:01:13.733 --> 00:01:14.666
I'm going to save him.

32
00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:16.766
Court your death

33
00:01:16.766 --> 00:01:18.500
Hurry up and arrange for people to leave

34
00:01:21.666 --> 00:01:24.200
Poetry has only one chance

35
00:01:24.266 --> 00:01:26.333
If you can't deliver the order.

36
00:01:26.333 --> 00:01:27.866
Then don't blame me

37
00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.433
You're welcome, you're dreaming.

38
00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.200
Is it Shishi?

39
00:01:36.533 --> 00:01:40.766
I hope your mouth is still so hard for a while.

40
00:01:44.733 --> 00:01:47.566
Yaoyao, may I ask Sister Luo Yun?
