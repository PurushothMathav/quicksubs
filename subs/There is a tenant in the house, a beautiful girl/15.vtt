00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.333

I bought a painting today and so picked a painting

43
00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.100
That painting style is unique, I have seen it in my life

44
00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.166
One look and I thought it was the love of my life.

45
00:02:07.466 --> 00:02:10.966
It's a pity to mix with your thin face

46
00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.200
Hey, you said I can't come to school yet.

47
00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.266

00:02:23.866 --> 00:02:25.100
But don't worry.

00:02:25.166 --> 00:02:27.600
I will definitely pay you back in the future.

53
00:02:28.133 --> 00:02:31.633
My company has something to do, so I'll leave first, etc.

54
00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.633
This tenant has to settle the bill clearly

55
00:02:36.666 --> 00:02:38.900
I became your driver and boyfriend today

56
00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.966
I'm very tired, does this money have to be settled?

57
00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.900
