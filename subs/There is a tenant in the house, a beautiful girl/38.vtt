00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.466
I have already treated the patient inside.

2
00:00:03.566 --> 00:00:05.900
If you go in now

3
00:00:06.266 --> 00:00:09.833
Who is responsible for the three long and two short patients inside?

4
00:00:10.166 --> 00:00:14.966
Could it be that you want to kill our patient?

5
00:00:16.933 --> 00:00:19.000
What a lie

6
00:00:19.333 --> 00:00:21.400
You two are not capable

7
00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:22.866
Going into a game is wanton

8
00:00:22.866 --> 00:00:24.800
Coming out is to heal and save people, right?

9
00:00:25.166 --> 00:00:27.566
My senior sister's medical skills are outside the door

10
00:00:27.566 --> 00:00:30.433
Going in now is a lot of harm

11
00:00:30.533 --> 00:00:32.833
You two told you everything, didn't you?

12
00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:37.266
You and I don't want to talk nonsense with you here Dean

13
00:00:39.066 --> 00:00:39.866
everyone

14
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:41.600
That's it.

15
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.500
Let's not discuss these issues now.

16
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.000
In my opinion, uh, what Doctor Gao said just now

17
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.600
Patients can't come back to life, right?

18
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.233
Ah patient nonsense

19
00:00:52.333 --> 00:00:53.866
Get ready now

20
00:00:54.133 --> 00:00:55.066
Hahaha

21
00:00:55.066 --> 00:00:57.566
Dean, do you believe what they say?

22
00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:00.200
I think this Doctor Gao is simply abusive.

23
00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:01.266
top-up generation

24
00:01:02.066 --> 00:01:04.266
As for why he is here

25
00:01:04.333 --> 00:01:05.200
I see

26
00:01:05.266 --> 00:01:07.466
I just think this surgery plan is perfect

27
00:01:07.466 --> 00:01:08.966
It's complicated.

28
00:01:09.366 --> 00:01:12.100
Want to take this opportunity to enhance your reputation?

29
00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.100
Even if the surgery fails

30
00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.733
It can also be justified by the complexity of the surgery

31
00:01:15.733 --> 00:01:17.333
To get rid of your own suspicion

32
00:01:17.333 --> 00:01:19.700
You don't spill blood here

33
00:01:19.866 --> 00:01:21.200
I spat blood

34
00:01:21.266 --> 00:01:22.266
Then since it is not so

35
00:01:22.266 --> 00:01:23.800
Why won't you let us in?

36
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.666
Are you afraid of your handshake?

37
00:01:25.666 --> 00:01:27.233
It was discovered

38
00:01:28.166 --> 00:01:30.366
I'm not messing around.

39
00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:31.966
This is a hospital.

40
00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.966
Even if you want to go in

41
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.033
Then you have to ask the family members if they agree.

42
00:01:37.466 --> 00:01:39.466
I agree with Luo Yunjie I agree

43
00:01:39.466 --> 00:01:41.100
Please help me

44
00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.766
Please be fine

45
00:01:42.766 --> 00:01:43.766
Don't cry

46
00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:49.266
I'll go in and have a look too

47
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:51.800
Humph

48
00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.033
Miss Zhong

49
00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:57.000
I hope you don't regret today's decision.
