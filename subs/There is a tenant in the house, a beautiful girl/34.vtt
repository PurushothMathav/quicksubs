00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:03.900
Oops, of course I'm your handsome and charming

2
00:00:03.966 --> 00:00:05.300
Mr. Landlord

3
00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:06.466
But

4
00:00:06.466 --> 00:00:08.900
How could you draw Mr. Rain Ink so quickly?

5
00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:09.700
word

6
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.433
Tell me what's your relationship with him?

7
00:00:13.866 --> 00:00:16.166
Excuse me?

8
00:00:16.533 --> 00:00:19.900
You said this painting was painted by Chu Feng

9
00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:23.566
Hey, I still can't hide it from you.

10
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:25.366
I have a showdown.

11
00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:27.100
Yes, I am.

12
00:00:27.733 --> 00:00:29.066
Mr. Yun Mo

13
00:00:30.333 --> 00:00:32.566
Loyal fan of hahaha

14
00:00:32.566 --> 00:00:35.066
Oops, this is what my master taught me

15
00:00:35.066 --> 00:00:37.000
He specializes in painting fake paintings.

16
00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:38.900
Otherwise, how do you think my villa came to be?

17
00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:41.533
They were all drawn by my master one by one.

18
00:00:41.533 --> 00:00:43.400
Money is hard to make.

19
00:00:43.566 --> 00:00:46.466
What happened to your seal?

20
00:00:46.466 --> 00:00:47.900
Did you say seal?

21
00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:49.966
I have a lot of stamps. What?

22
00:00:50.133 --> 00:00:51.300
Mr. Yun Mo

23
00:00:51.366 --> 00:00:53.033
Nowadays, there are painting saints

24
00:00:53.533 --> 00:00:54.466
I'll give you one.

25
00:00:54.866 --> 00:00:57.200
No but I tell you

26
00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.866
After you

27
00:00:57.866 --> 00:01:00.600
It is no longer allowed to imitate Mr. Yun Mo's words

28
00:01:01.166 --> 00:01:02.800
Ok ok ok

29
00:01:03.366 --> 00:01:05.900
I'm hungry all afternoon. Let's eat

30
00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:06.766
My treat.

31
00:01:07.933 --> 00:01:12.366
Stinky rascal, are you interested in frogs?

32
00:01:12.366 --> 00:01:14.200
All of a sudden

33
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.666
tricky

34
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.333
Didn't someone contribute to me today?

35
00:01:19.333 --> 00:01:22.266
I call it borrowing flowers to offer Buddha to you

36
00:01:23.566 --> 00:01:26.733
Clear, I must eat poor him today

37
00:01:26.733 --> 00:01:30.166
Let's go, let's go, come on

38
00:01:31.366 --> 00:01:32.666
Eat tomatoes

39
00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.966
The dean is ready for surgery at any time

40
00:01:39.366 --> 00:01:40.200
Dr. Luo

41
00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.666
I don't need you for this surgery today.

42
00:01:43.066 --> 00:01:44.900
Go change your clothes and rest

43
00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:46.466
What do you mean it's not the master?

44
00:01:46.466 --> 00:01:48.700
Who else can do this surgery but me?

45
00:01:50.366 --> 00:01:51.166
Dad

46
00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:54.966
Of course it's me
