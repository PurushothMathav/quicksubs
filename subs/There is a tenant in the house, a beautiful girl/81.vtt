00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.233
Oops, I don't want to be a coolie, you

2
00:00:04.366 --> 00:00:06.500
Who made you the great ecology at the end of the Yuan Dynasty?

3
00:00:06.866 --> 00:00:09.200
As long as you are willing to give me all your expensive things.

4
00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:10.033
Just manage

5
00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:15.066
OK, then how much you can learn is up to you.

6
00:00:15.166 --> 00:00:16.200
Oh, really?

7
00:00:16.866 --> 00:00:19.433
Last time I saw your attitude towards Master Qinghe

8
00:00:19.466 --> 00:00:21.700
I thought you didn't want to teach it to others

9
00:00:21.733 --> 00:00:24.600
You don't even think about how old that old man is

10
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:25.700
I'm going to give it to him

11
00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:27.266
How do you teach it to future generations?

12
00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:30.633
What a big breath

13
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.400
Dare to say that you are Mr. Yun Mo

14
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.166
Liu Xiong, I have already told you

15
00:00:36.166 --> 00:00:37.800
Impossible between us

16
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.366
Don't come to me again

17
00:00:39.366 --> 00:00:41.033
Please get out now

18
00:00:41.466 --> 00:00:42.466
little girl

19
00:00:42.766 --> 00:00:44.766
Although I don't know why Quanzi likes you

20
00:00:44.766 --> 00:00:46.300
But your attitude

21
00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:47.866
This is hitting our Liu family in the face.

22
00:00:47.866 --> 00:00:49.500
How dare you Liu Family come?

23
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.366
It seems that the face was not hit hard enough last time.

24
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.800
Who's your dad?

25
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
It's this kid who's been targeting me

26
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:00.500
lad

27
00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.533
Although I don't know where you came from

28
00:01:02.533 --> 00:01:03.900
But in this place

29
00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:05.600
No one dares to insult me Liu Jia

30
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.666
No one dares to be arrogant in front of me

31
00:01:08.166 --> 00:01:10.200
Never seen it, right?

32
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.766
You saw it today, hey

33
00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.266
I heard you call yourself Mr. Yunmo

34
00:01:16.266 --> 00:01:19.900
Coincidentally, this gentleman said he was also Mr. Yunmo
