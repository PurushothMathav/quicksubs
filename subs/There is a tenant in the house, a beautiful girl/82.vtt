00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.366
Oh, really?

2
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:04.700
young man

3
00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:07.266
Although the old woman went deep and said

4
00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:10.400
But not everyone can impersonate

5
00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:11.966
Hey old man

6
00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:15.133
You say you are too old to stay at home

7
00:00:15.133 --> 00:00:17.066
Run out and pretend to be someone else

8
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.833
You really can't tell your own identity?

9
00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.900
There is a saying that disaster comes from the mouth

10
00:00:22.933 --> 00:00:24.466
I see you are not very involved in the world

11
00:00:24.566 --> 00:00:26.466
I don't want to know you in general

12
00:00:26.666 --> 00:00:28.900
As long as you make amends and apologize

13
00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:31.033
This thing can't be passed

14
00:00:32.133 --> 00:00:34.200
But as soon as I speak

15
00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:35.900
There must be people

16
00:00:35.933 --> 00:00:38.466
Will solve your trouble for me

17
00:00:39.866 --> 00:00:42.100
Are you Mr. Yun Mo?

18
00:00:42.133 --> 00:00:44.966
Don't worry, this old man is a liar

19
00:00:44.966 --> 00:00:46.600
See how I can expose him?

20
00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.700
Hmm old man

21
00:00:48.733 --> 00:00:50.500
You said you were Mr. Yunmo

22
00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.166
Is there any evidence?

23
00:00:52.166 --> 00:00:52.900
It seems so.

24
00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.366
Now your identity is more susceptible to suspicion

25
00:00:55.366 --> 00:00:58.366
What evidence do you have to prove your identity?

26
00:00:58.866 --> 00:00:59.666
President Liu

27
00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.100
Since you can sit in this position today

28
00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.733
You must recognize Mr. Yunmo's seal, right?

29
00:01:05.733 --> 00:01:06.966
Of course I do.

30
00:01:07.066 --> 00:01:09.600
The patient was fortunate to receive Mr. Yun Mo's ink treasure

31
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.100
Although accidentally damaged

32
00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.166
But at least I know

33
00:01:14.066 --> 00:01:15.666
It was a routine last time

34
00:01:15.666 --> 00:01:18.000
Xiao Liuzi, you didn't even tell your father

35
00:01:18.533 --> 00:01:19.566
Well done.

36
00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.100
You said so much

37
00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.766
Doesn't prove anything

38
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.366
How do you explain your own identity?

39
00:01:25.466 --> 00:01:27.466
Don't worry, I'm looking for it

40
00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:32.000
Hey, do you recognize this seal?
