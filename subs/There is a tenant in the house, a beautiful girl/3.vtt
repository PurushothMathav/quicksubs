00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.833
He must be so excited to marry me now

2
00:00:02.866 --> 00:00:05.033
I'm so handsome

3
00:00:05.866 --> 00:00:09.066
Why does he look a bit stuck?

4
00:00:09.566 --> 00:00:11.166
It looks a little familiar

5
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.500
Hahahaha

6
00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.900
Shishi, don't tell me what you're wearing

7
00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:19.866
Such a rustic bumpkin

8
00:00:19.866 --> 00:00:21.800
Is your boyfriend

9
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.700
That's right! He's my boyfriend!

10
00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:27.200
Who the hell would believe it, hahaha

11
00:00:27.566 --> 00:00:30.100
Wang Fan, if you still want some face

12
00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:32.766
Don't bother me in the future, don't try

13
00:00:32.966 --> 00:00:35.100
No one has dared to rob me of Wang Fan

14
00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.600
Somebody beat him until he smokes

15
00:00:39.933 --> 00:00:41.400
This has nothing to do with him

16
00:00:41.466 --> 00:00:42.533
You let him go

17
00:00:42.533 --> 00:00:45.733
It has nothing to do with the man who dares to rob a woman from me Wang Fan

18
00:00:45.733 --> 00:00:48.966
No one can see the sun tomorrow

19
00:00:48.966 --> 00:00:50.666
Somebody do it.

20
00:01:02.733 --> 00:01:04.200
I thought it was amazing

21
00:01:04.333 --> 00:01:06.166
You go bluff

22
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.033
Will you fight?

23
00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:10.300
Black is awesome

24
00:01:11.366 --> 00:01:12.400
Is the underworld

25
00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:16.433
Are you going?

26
00:01:19.333 --> 00:01:21.100
You have the guts, boy

27
00:01:23.366 --> 00:01:24.366
temporary matter

28
00:01:24.533 --> 00:01:27.300
I see if you still dare to be stubborn at the banquet tomorrow

29
00:01:27.766 --> 00:01:30.833
Hey, go, go, go, go, stupid

30
00:01:33.166 --> 00:01:35.166
Fact Tomorrow

31
00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:36.900
Your grandfather will be at the birthday party

32
00:01:36.933 --> 00:01:38.766
Announce your marriage to Wang Shao

33
00:01:39.066 --> 00:01:40.100
At that time

34
00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.033
I see how you can explain it to his old man yourself

35
00:01:47.933 --> 00:01:48.733
Hey

36
00:01:50.266 --> 00:01:52.166
How is the woman

37
00:01:52.366 --> 00:01:53.833
How can you thank me?
