00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.166
West Wind is looking for me

2
00:00:02.166 --> 00:00:03.766
What is this woman looking for me for?

3
00:00:03.866 --> 00:00:04.900
What west wind?

4
00:00:05.133 --> 00:00:07.466
Just the one who sings, that's the west wind.

5
00:00:07.466 --> 00:00:09.366
Don't tell me, help me over there

6
00:00:09.366 --> 00:00:10.900
You said the one who sang just now

7
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.700
He finished singing and just left

8
00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:16.466
Why are you looking for him?

9
00:00:16.466 --> 00:00:17.800
Do you like people?

10
00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:19.833
What are you talking about?

11
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.633
It was when my dad was sick and in the hospital that he urgently needed surgery

12
00:00:23.733 --> 00:00:25.366
In my most difficult time

13
00:00:25.366 --> 00:00:28.700
It was this man named Zephyr who was so frivolous in one breath

14
00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:31.433
Everything in the shopping cart in my live stream.

15
00:00:32.066 --> 00:00:35.000
Not only did I pay off my dad's surgery

16
00:00:35.133 --> 00:00:38.600
And let me pay the rent for your stingy man

17
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.366
I just wanted to thank him in person for liking it

18
00:00:44.766 --> 00:00:47.300
After that, you won't be paying attention to us in the future.

19
00:00:47.666 --> 00:00:49.700
Ah, what are you talking about?

20
00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:51.633
Nothing, I mean?

21
00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:53.500
That person helped you without leaving your name

22
00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.700
Then he definitely doesn't want you to have a psychological burden

23
00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.433
You don't need to care too much

24
00:00:57.966 --> 00:00:59.866
I know what you said.

25
00:00:59.866 --> 00:01:02.766
I just wanted to thank him in person.

26
00:01:02.933 --> 00:01:04.700
Last time in the live stream.

27
00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:07.866
He hasn't been online for the past few days after he bought something.

28
00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.633
If it weren't for those stinky hooligans pretending to be the west wind today

29
00:01:11.766 --> 00:01:13.766
I can't be here either.

30
00:01:14.166 --> 00:01:16.800
Maybe he's been busy lately.

31
00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.333
I don't have time to watch your live stream.

32
00:01:18.333 --> 00:01:19.500
Uh, let's talk about it

33
00:01:19.766 --> 00:01:21.266
The one called West Wind

34
00:01:21.266 --> 00:01:22.966
What if it's your nemesis in reality?

35
00:01:22.966 --> 00:01:24.600
Wouldn't it be more awkward for you to meet?

36
00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.900
I forbid you to say that, Brother West Wind

37
00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.300
Do you think everyone in the world is like you?

38
00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:31.433
The evil landlord is as annoying as the dead landlord

39
00:01:32.533 --> 00:01:35.600
Besides, even if I have a mortal enemy

40
00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:37.566
It will only be you

41
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.766
Okay, okay, you're right

42
00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:45.900
Come on.

43
00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.100
Why are you carrying you back? You can still walk on these feet.

44
00:01:49.366 --> 00:01:50.366
Come on up.

45
00:01:53.866 --> 00:01:54.900
Say yes first.

46
00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:58.366
Give you 200 money, and you will know the money.
