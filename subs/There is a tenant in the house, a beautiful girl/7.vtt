00:00:06.366 --> 00:00:07.500
It's Sister Su Yan

4
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.466
It's nothing, it's all a misunderstanding

5
00:00:10.533 --> 00:00:13.233
Since it's all a misunderstanding, the festival is on, right?

6
00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:14.200
OK

7
00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:18.000
Who are you so fierce? Go upstairs and wash up

8
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.833
I'll change your clothes later.

9
00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:23.666
Let's have dinner together tonight, okay, thank you, Senior Sister, eh?

10
00:00:25.366 --> 00:00:27.500
Why don't you go tonight?

11
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.800
I remember, there's still an interview.

12
00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.300
You talk first, you talk first

13
00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.733
I'll go first, Sister Luoying, I have to live stream later.

14
00:00:35.733 --> 00:00:37.000
I have to go do my makeup.

15
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.433
I have to go I have to go ah ah ah ah

16
00:00:40.066 --> 00:00:42.300
Are you so busy, don't you eat?

17
00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:44.900
Then I will tell the little junior brother later.

18
00:00:51.666 --> 00:00:53.466
Zhong Yuntao male

19
00:00:53.466 --> 00:00:56.600
58-Year-old wife throughout the mid-term

20
00:00:57.333 --> 00:00:59.000
Is this Senior Sister's patient?

21
00:00:59.366 --> 00:01:01.000
Zhong

22
00:01:01.566 --> 00:01:03.066
Could it be Zhong Yao's father?

23
00:01:06.266 --> 00:01:09.000
Hey, why are you rummaging through other people's things?

24
00:01:09.733 --> 00:01:10.933
I am the landlord

25
00:01:10.933 --> 00:01:13.400
Put it here and I'll just take a look?

26
00:01:13.733 --> 00:01:16.433
As a landlord, can you just look through other people's things?

27
00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:18.866
Oops, sorry.

28
00:01:18.866 --> 00:01:20.566
I didn't mean to.

29
00:01:20.566 --> 00:01:22.366
Miss Ben is too lazy to talk nonsense with you.

30
00:01:22.366 --> 00:01:23.666
I'll be live in a while.

31
00:01:23.666 --> 00:01:24.800
I went to work.

32
00:01:25.166 --> 00:01:27.166
Well, by the way, Guangdong.

00:01:29.266 --> 00:01:31.733
