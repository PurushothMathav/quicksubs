00:00:01.466 --> 00:00:03.900
Why are you the only streamer in Yaoyao?

2
00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:05.366
He went out shopping.

3
00:00:05.366 --> 00:00:08.600
Then you go to my uncle first, and I'll go to him first.

4
00:00:09.666 --> 00:00:13.366
Get used to why Sister Luo Ying is in a hurry

5
00:00:14.333 --> 00:00:16.800
Do they have secrets?

6
00:00:25.333 --> 00:00:26.966
How can the world be you?

7
00:00:26.966 --> 00:00:29.366
Grandmaster brother said

8
00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:32.900
What the hell happened today why do you remember

9
00:00:33.466 --> 00:00:37.566
Everything is the book ordered by the salesperson. Okay.

10
00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:41.266
If you don't give me a satisfactory answer today

11
00:00:41.933 --> 00:00:42.733
Humph

12
00:00:44.166 --> 00:00:47.300
Sister, you know that I am lazy.

13
00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.366
I'm not afraid of the trouble so I didn't tell you

14
00:00:49.366 --> 00:00:50.633
Can you do medicine?

15
00:00:51.133 --> 00:00:53.466
It's all my fault for those two guys today

16
00:00:54.733 --> 00:00:56.266
Ah go go go go

17
00:00:56.266 --> 00:00:57.966
You dare to lie to your senior sister, right?

18
00:00:57.966 --> 00:01:00.200
Ouch, did you send what was sent on the phone?

19
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.366
Ah yes yes yes

20
00:01:01.366 --> 00:01:02.866
The ears are about to fall off, aren't they?

21
00:01:03.166 --> 00:01:06.033
This is the first and last time

22
00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.600
Let me find out later that you dare to lie to me.

23
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.866
Let me tell you how much you know

24
00:01:12.266 --> 00:01:13.233
YES YES YES

25
00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.233
I'll send something to the central government first, go away

26
00:01:21.866 --> 00:01:23.600
It's kind of hard to abstract.

27
00:01:26.166 --> 00:01:27.000
Oh, dear.

28
00:01:28.866 --> 00:01:30.566
Are you stupid?

29
00:01:30.666 --> 00:01:34.466
Isn't the good husband you want always by your side?

30
00:01:36.666 --> 00:01:37.666
Junior brother

31
00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:39.400
OK

32
00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:41.500
Here comes the kiss

33
00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.200
Yaoyao, I'm on duty today, you can go back first

34
00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:45.700
Uncle, I'll take care of it tonight

35
00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.733
Then it's hard for you, I'll welcome it, it's alright.

36
00:01:49.733 --> 00:01:51.500
Then I'll go to work first. Okay.

37
00:01:52.766 --> 00:01:54.033
Hey, by the way, Yaoyao

38
00:01:54.066 --> 00:01:56.533
I'm not going back tonight

39
00:01:56.533 --> 00:01:59.700
You were in the same room with him alone

40
00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:03.600
Take this

41
00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.300
If he dares to do anything to you, I will
