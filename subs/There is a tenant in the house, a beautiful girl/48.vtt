00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.766
Ha, you are over your head.

2
00:00:02.766 --> 00:00:06.766
Oops little brother speaks so confidently

3
00:00:07.066 --> 00:00:07.966
presumably

4
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.033
Is it a master teacher who produces a master apprentice?

5
00:00:11.566 --> 00:00:14.566
I don't know who your teacher is from?

6
00:00:14.566 --> 00:00:17.100
Oops self-taught

7
00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:18.700
self-taught

8
00:00:19.366 --> 00:00:23.300
Then win Liu Shao and then come out to compete with me

9
00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:24.100
Humph

10
00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:25.500
OK

11
00:00:26.266 --> 00:00:27.933
Since you have to make a fool of yourself

12
00:00:27.933 --> 00:00:30.566
Then I'll reluctantly do it

13
00:00:31.166 --> 00:00:35.000
Boy, don't forget our

14
00:00:36.733 --> 00:00:38.833
Uncle, what are you doing?

15
00:00:38.866 --> 00:00:40.500
This is not a parody.

16
00:00:40.766 --> 00:00:43.300
Why don't you remember that I am the first in the class?

17
00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:46.233
No matter how good the imitation is, it's useless.

18
00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.600
Don't worry, famous flower.

19
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.000
I only need one finger

20
00:00:56.066 --> 00:00:57.233
Ugly

21
00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:59.666
Not bad. Not bad.

22
00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.966
Liu Gongzi's family history

23
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.466
The earth is profound

24
00:01:03.733 --> 00:01:06.100
This painting is still slightly lacking

25
00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.133
But to be able to make paintings like this at your age

26
00:01:09.133 --> 00:01:12.866
Hahaha, President Liu has a successor?

27
00:01:12.866 --> 00:01:13.500
Hahaha

28
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.700
I can even call it shaking if I wipe my butt hard with this thing.

29
00:01:17.066 --> 00:01:19.500
If you have the ability, can you draw a work?

30
00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.166
Who wouldn't brag?

31
00:01:21.333 --> 00:01:23.166
Then you have to watch it carefully.

32
00:01:23.166 --> 00:01:27.666
Today I'm going to draw a picture of the phoenix

33
00:01:45.666 --> 00:01:47.000
You're done.

34
00:01:50.766 --> 00:01:52.400
Hahahaha

35
00:01:53.133 --> 00:01:56.266
You call this the Phoenix Aoyi Tu

36
00:01:56.466 --> 00:01:57.866
Hey sorry to go

37
00:01:57.933 --> 00:01:59.066
One more

38
00:02:05.933 --> 00:02:09.100
Stinky bun, are you here to make me laugh?

39
00:02:09.733 --> 00:02:12.566
Now, get down on your knees and learn to bark

40
00:02:12.566 --> 00:02:14.266
I'm thinking about sparing you

41
00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.900
Why don't you crawl out of here tonight?

42
00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.700
It's not up to you whether I draw well or not

43
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.800
You say yes thief
