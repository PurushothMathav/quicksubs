1
00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:06.400
This seems to be a really exquisite invitation

2
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.633
Even if you have an invitation

3
00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.300
It is also the blessing of Wang Shao

4
00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:11.600
Without Wang Shao

5
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:13.666
Our neighbors can't get into the exquisite feast either

6
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.133
This neighbor still uses my invitation letter from the Wang family

7
00:00:16.133 --> 00:00:19.433
How can Lin Shishi have an invitation letter when she comes in?

8
00:00:19.533 --> 00:00:21.800
Lin Shishi, how dare you?

9
00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.400
You know, fake invitations?

10
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.866
Fake wow

11
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:27.466
Bring it over

12
00:00:30.733 --> 00:00:32.700
Lin Shishi, let me tell you

13
00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:33.900
What about this exquisite feast?

14
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:35.733
Only top families will be invited

15
00:00:35.733 --> 00:00:37.166
Will come here to participate

16
00:00:37.166 --> 00:00:40.100
Your neighbor's assets are less than one million

17
00:00:40.133 --> 00:00:43.500
You wouldn't be able to enter this ballroom without me

18
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:44.466
Say

19
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.066
I don't remember saying hello to the organizers

20
00:00:48.166 --> 00:00:50.400
Did you send an invitation letter to your Lin family?

21
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.666
Lin Shishi, you have to make it clear.

22
00:00:52.666 --> 00:00:54.266
If you can't tell

23
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.666
It's not just you.

24
00:00:55.666 --> 00:00:58.366
Even your Lin family is afraid of becoming famous

25
00:00:58.366 --> 00:00:59.366
This invitation

26
00:00:59.466 --> 00:01:01.866
It was obviously delivered to me by the organizers themselves

27
00:01:01.933 --> 00:01:03.066
How could it be fake?

28
00:01:03.066 --> 00:01:04.600
Are you trying to kill the Lins?

29
00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.133
Ah, our Lin family

30
00:01:06.133 --> 00:01:08.566
How did you give birth to a wolf-hearted little shriveled calf?

31
00:01:08.566 --> 00:01:09.866
Son lawyer

32
00:01:10.366 --> 00:01:12.166
You broke off the marriage privately

33
00:01:12.166 --> 00:01:14.100
Found a wild boy to come back and fool us

34
00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.233
Forget it.

35
00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.700
Today is really rebellious

36
00:01:17.733 --> 00:01:19.766
Get down on your knees, you bastard

37
00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:24.800
From now on

38
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.533
I'm not as wonderful as your daughter.

39
00:01:27.533 --> 00:01:28.866
It's really wonderful.

40
00:01:28.866 --> 00:01:30.766
It's really the opening mouth

41
00:01:30.866 --> 00:01:31.933
Rumor-mongering, treasure legs.

42
00:01:31.933 --> 00:01:33.866
Just by your random guesses there

43
00:01:33.933 --> 00:01:35.400
Rat wake up or fake

44
00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.766
If it's true, you can tear it up at will

45
00:01:37.766 --> 00:01:39.766
In a while, people from the four major families will come

46
00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.300
Unlucky, I don't know who it is.

47
00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.200
What are you still doing?

48
00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.300
Do it, I'll see who dares to move

49
00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:48.066
Linglong, who dares to make trouble on your face?
