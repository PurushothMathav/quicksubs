00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.433
Who eats bear hearts and leopards? Cut our family to eat

2
00:00:05.133 --> 00:00:06.000
sister

3
00:00:06.566 --> 00:00:08.300
It's not who is Wang Fan

4
00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:11.166
I won't stare at him when Wang Fan dies

5
00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.633
Oops, I don't know who it is.

6
00:00:13.666 --> 00:00:15.600
It's Wang Fan. He asked me for dinner yesterday.

7
00:00:15.766 --> 00:00:17.466
He put something in my drink

8
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:19.300
And he sent someone to follow me

9
00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:20.566
I was in a hurry

10
00:00:20.566 --> 00:00:22.400
I just walked into a random room

11
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.166
But when I woke up in the morning

12
00:00:24.166 --> 00:00:26.133
I can't remember anything

13
00:00:26.133 --> 00:00:27.833
What should I do now?

14
00:00:28.166 --> 00:00:32.033
It's not you, you don't know who it is

15
00:00:32.366 --> 00:00:35.566
What can I think of now?

16
00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.666
This damn guy

17
00:00:38.666 --> 00:00:40.000
Bullying our Shishi

18
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.766
He still wants me to see him

19
00:00:42.133 --> 00:00:43.300
Make him look good

20
00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:44.266
Who do you want to look good?

21
00:00:45.066 --> 00:00:47.000
Hey, who are you scaring?

22
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:48.700
We

23
00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:51.066
What a coincidence you came.

24
00:00:51.333 --> 00:00:53.266
It's all up to you tomorrow

25
00:00:53.266 --> 00:00:56.366
Don't worry, you won't be disappointed tomorrow.

26
00:00:56.366 --> 00:00:57.933
Who made me your rental boyfriend?

27
00:00:57.933 --> 00:00:59.466
You are

28
00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:01.400
Don't get me wrong.

29
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.966
And me?

30
00:01:01.966 --> 00:01:04.933
I just need a man to pretend to be my boyfriend

31
00:01:04.933 --> 00:01:06.466
Go to Grandpa's Birthday Banquet

32
00:01:06.566 --> 00:01:08.500
Just reject Wang Fang

33
00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:09.400
Is that so?

34
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.100
How about tomorrow?

35
00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.500
You must be at the grandpa's birthday banquet

36
00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.200
The task assigned to you by the teacher

37
00:01:17.266 --> 00:01:19.033
It's done, okay?

38
00:01:19.266 --> 00:01:22.000
It's no problem for the little master to go out with the horse bag.

39
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.233
Went to bed

40
00:01:24.133 --> 00:01:25.666
Hey, bye.

41
00:01:28.333 --> 00:01:29.600
Don't worry about this

42
00:01:30.133 --> 00:01:31.000
Hold on

43
00:01:34.133 --> 00:01:37.400
Let's wish the old man a blessing like the East Sea

44
00:01:37.466 --> 00:01:38.866
Shoubinan Mountain

45
00:01:38.866 --> 00:01:40.200
Grandpa drink more

46
00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.233
Ok ok ok for you

47
00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.600
Home Wang Shao to Wang Family Wang Board

48
00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.766
Send a golden thread of jadeite

49
00:01:47.766 --> 00:01:49.766
Newbies welcome to work

50
00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.800
Hahaha, the Wang family is really rich.

51
00:01:53.966 --> 00:01:55.933
To offer such a precious gift

52
00:01:55.933 --> 00:01:57.533
Yeah, just those two things.

53
00:01:57.533 --> 00:02:01.100
This is already worth tens of millions, oops, hahaha.

54
00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:02.433
Son-in-law?

55
00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:03.733
From now on?

56
00:02:03.733 --> 00:02:07.100
Our Lin Wang family is one family

57
00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:08.666
Who is the family?

58
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.200
If your Lin family doesn't give me an explanation today

59
00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.200
I will bankrupt your Lin family

60
00:02:14.466 --> 00:02:16.166
Not Wang Shao

61
00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.000
What do you mean? What do you mean?

62
00:02:18.066 --> 00:02:22.400
Then you have to ask your good granddaughter Lin Shishi

63
00:02:23.366 --> 00:02:25.800
Teacher, I hit you

64
00:02:27.566 --> 00:02:28.566
Grandpa
