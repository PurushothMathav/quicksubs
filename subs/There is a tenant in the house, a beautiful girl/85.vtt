00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:02.700
Chu Feng, what tricks are you trying to play?

2
00:00:02.866 --> 00:00:03.566
Today?

3
00:00:03.566 --> 00:00:06.200
Even if you call the green monkey over, it's useless

4
00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:08.366
Because, Mr. Yunmo

5
00:00:08.466 --> 00:00:11.700
Squeezing you to death is as simple as pinching an ant to death

6
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.300
Old man, I will only give you one chance.

7
00:00:15.566 --> 00:00:16.733
I'll count to three.

8
00:00:16.733 --> 00:00:19.000
You don't talk about yourself anymore

9
00:00:19.166 --> 00:00:20.566
Don't blame me for being rude to you.

10
00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:23.400
I Chu Feng kicked Nanshan Nursing Home

11
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.033
Boxing Beihai kindergarten

12
00:00:25.133 --> 00:00:27.200
Don't think I'm too old to beat you up

13
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.466
Humph

14
00:00:29.466 --> 00:00:32.066
Young man, I've been looking for you for so long

15
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.900
If you don't return it in this life, call him dad.

16
00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:37.400
You still want to shoot me

17
00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:42.766
Hmph, do you think President Liu is so easy to talk to?

18
00:00:43.266 --> 00:00:45.500
Erha Dad

19
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:46.533
What are you waiting for?

20
00:00:46.533 --> 00:00:48.900
Hurry up and recruit someone to take him away

21
00:00:49.166 --> 00:00:51.833
Stole priceless paintings and seals

22
00:00:51.866 --> 00:00:53.900
I want him to squat until the next life

23
00:00:54.533 --> 00:00:55.366
Mr. Yu Meng

24
00:00:55.366 --> 00:00:56.233
Sorry.

25
00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.366
My friend will never steal.

26
00:00:58.366 --> 00:01:00.366
There must be some misunderstanding

27
00:01:00.366 --> 00:01:03.600
Sanqiuwan, don't you understand yet?

28
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.366
Do you still believe this guy?

29
00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.900
The real Master Yunmo is right next to him

30
00:01:08.166 --> 00:01:09.966
This is fake.

31
00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.600
Master Yun Mo, I'm really sorry, my friend.

32
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.066
Must have been wronged

33
00:01:14.066 --> 00:01:16.366
Please give him another chance.

34
00:01:16.366 --> 00:01:17.166
Humph

35
00:01:17.733 --> 00:01:21.200
Master Mo, you really can't afford to offend

36
00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.900
Are you offending yourself? It's the first time I've heard of it

37
00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.266
Old man, I've already given you a chance

38
00:01:28.266 --> 00:01:29.900
It's something you don't cherish.

39
00:01:30.166 --> 00:01:31.466
Obsessed

40
00:01:31.933 --> 00:01:32.833
President Liu

41
00:01:33.133 --> 00:01:36.066
If you don't give me a full moon answer today

42
00:01:36.733 --> 00:01:38.466
Don't blame me for being rude

43
00:01:39.866 --> 00:01:40.933
Chu Feng, right?

44
00:01:40.933 --> 00:01:41.800
Don't worry.

45
00:01:42.066 --> 00:01:45.200
After you go in, I will ask someone to take good care of you.

46
00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.633
Old Wu, do you want to find your son?
