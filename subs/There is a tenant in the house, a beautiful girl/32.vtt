00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.000
Brothers are almost done

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.533
Don't you look at me like that?

3
00:00:03.533 --> 00:00:05.966
People send nickname human body printer

4
00:00:05.966 --> 00:00:07.333
I've seen that a hundred times.

5
00:00:07.333 --> 00:00:08.666
Very ripe otherwise

6
00:00:08.666 --> 00:00:10.700
How can I tell at a glance that he is holding garbage?

7
00:00:11.566 --> 00:00:13.000
Hey, you're done.

8
00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:19.633
What are you doing?

9
00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:23.300
You wait for me

10
00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:35.900
Hey beauty

11
00:00:36.133 --> 00:00:38.200
I guess your friend has already

12
00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:39.933
Run away in fear

13
00:00:39.933 --> 00:00:41.466
Hmm impossible

14
00:00:41.466 --> 00:00:43.266
He's not what you're talking about

15
00:00:43.366 --> 00:00:46.700
Besides, didn't you come back tonight?

16
00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.400
Don't you believe in kissing?

17
00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:51.733
Know the face but not the heart

18
00:00:51.733 --> 00:00:54.666
After all, it's 28 million

19
00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:55.966
Who knows?

20
00:00:55.966 --> 00:00:58.100
I'm still running for this money

21
00:01:01.266 --> 00:01:03.100
Yo didn't run

22
00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.966
Did you come back with your so-called truth?

23
00:01:05.966 --> 00:01:07.533
Let's have a look.

24
00:01:07.533 --> 00:01:09.300
See you in tears?

25
00:01:09.366 --> 00:01:11.766
That's right, the truth is here

26
00:01:12.066 --> 00:01:13.900
Hahaha kid

27
00:01:13.933 --> 00:01:15.766
I thought you were trying to be brave

28
00:01:15.766 --> 00:01:17.766
I didn't expect you to be able to whistle.

29
00:01:18.166 --> 00:01:21.266
My painting has been painted by several masters

30
00:01:21.266 --> 00:01:25.266
Identified, where did you find this garbage?

31
00:01:25.466 --> 00:01:28.433
How dare you, since you want to die

32
00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.300
I will fulfill you today

33
00:01:30.933 --> 00:01:33.300
Call security in and throw him out for me

34
00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:34.533
Not you

35
00:01:34.533 --> 00:01:37.600
So many people who claim to be young talents in the painting and calligraphy world

36
00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:38.666
True or False

37
00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:41.600
You can tell at a glance, okay?

38
00:01:41.866 --> 00:01:45.100
Then you take out this fake painting

39
00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.100
I'll see what you can do

40
00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.233
This is true or false.
