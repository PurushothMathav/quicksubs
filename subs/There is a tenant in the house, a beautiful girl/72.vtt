1
00:00:00.733 --> 00:00:01.533
Li Shishi

2
00:00:02.133 --> 00:00:03.066
What do you want?

3
00:00:03.066 --> 00:00:04.933
Can't you see

4
00:00:04.933 --> 00:00:06.933
Am I signing up to sign an order?

5
00:00:06.933 --> 00:00:10.500
Li Shishi, have you had enough trouble?

6
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.666
My old girl is not dead yet

7
00:00:12.666 --> 00:00:15.000
Is the Lin family on your turn to speak?

8
00:00:15.066 --> 00:00:18.166
Besides, Jiaojiao is the general manager now

9
00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.800
You have to submit the registration too.

10
00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:22.766
Do you have any say here?

11
00:00:22.766 --> 00:00:24.900
Bring me a fake to try

12
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.333
Look at what made Mr. Lin angry?

13
00:00:28.333 --> 00:00:29.700
Mr. Lin also spoke

14
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:31.266
I'm really curious

15
00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.533
What status do you rely on to participate?

16
00:00:33.533 --> 00:00:35.700
Is it possible to register a new company?

17
00:00:35.766 --> 00:00:38.200
Donate to people in need when your brain is useless

18
00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.600
Brat, that's my daughter

19
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.900
Who just said she didn't want it?

20
00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:46.366
Sister should be self-aware

21
00:00:46.366 --> 00:00:49.300
Well, only Wang Shao can match this order.

22
00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.200
As long as Wang Shao gets the order

23
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.800
The tide rises in our neighborhood.

24
00:00:53.966 --> 00:00:55.600
I'll be happy then.

25
00:00:55.733 --> 00:00:57.566
Maybe I can even give you a mouthful of soup

26
00:00:57.566 --> 00:01:00.800
Well, if they're willing to humiliate themselves

27
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:02.200
Why should we stop?

28
00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:03.766
This Lin Shishi is from the Lin family

29
00:01:03.766 --> 00:01:05.400
Now I come out to pick up the order by myself.

30
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.766
Not in line with the rules

31
00:01:06.766 --> 00:01:08.800
Poetry is now in the name of the individual

32
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.900
In other words, the order is in Shishi's hands

33
00:01:12.066 --> 00:01:14.600
No need to have any relationship with any family

34
00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.266
Everything is run by his new company

35
00:01:17.266 --> 00:01:17.566
kid

36
00:01:17.566 --> 00:01:20.700
I said, is your brain stupid or show off?

37
00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.900
Used an unregistered new salary

38
00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:25.066
Come and participate in our 100 billion orders.

39
00:01:25.066 --> 00:01:26.266
Are you crazy?

40
00:01:26.666 --> 00:01:30.800
Could it be that you think the four major families are fools?

41
00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.733
I think you're the fool.

42
00:01:32.733 --> 00:01:34.600
You should go to the hospital to have a good look.

43
00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.666
If you go late, you won't be saved.

44
00:01:36.666 --> 00:01:39.000
Although we have not yet registered the company

45
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.866
But in the capacity of implementation

46
00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.000
You can get the order at will.
