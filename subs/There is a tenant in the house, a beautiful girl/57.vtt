00:00:00.566 --> 00:00:02.966
Host, get in the car!

2
00:00:02.966 --> 00:00:05.366
I'll see someone later, you can go back first

3
00:00:05.366 --> 00:00:07.866
Then you pay attention to safety, bye

4
00:00:14.533 --> 00:00:16.533
Since it's all here, come over

5
00:00:16.533 --> 00:00:18.666
I'm not telling you what's going on with you guys

6
00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:19.466
Didn't I say it all?

7
00:00:19.466 --> 00:00:21.666
I have nothing to do with the old man

8
00:00:21.666 --> 00:00:24.033
I also don't want to inherit the differences between your four families

9
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.433
It's okay, don't keep following me secretly

10
00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:29.066
What are you doing?

11
00:00:29.066 --> 00:00:29.866
Say less

12
00:00:30.166 --> 00:00:33.333
The old master explained too much, I will wait to listen to the arrangement of the young master

13
00:00:33.333 --> 00:00:35.133
I always know that the young master is unwilling

14
00:00:35.133 --> 00:00:36.800
Accept the family business

15
00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.133
But the young master is not with the lady next door

16
00:00:39.133 --> 00:00:40.800
Is the temporary relationship unusual?

17
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.566
I didn't expect to take this opportunity to help the young lady

18
00:00:44.666 --> 00:00:45.600
What young lady

19
00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:47.866
It was all an accident.

20
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.900
I called you here today just to tell you

21
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:55.200
It's okay, don't keep revealing my identity secretly?

22
00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.366
I don't want to be judged everywhere I go

23
00:00:57.966 --> 00:00:59.766
Ok you go back

24
00:01:00.166 --> 00:01:01.033
Oh, right.

25
00:01:01.166 --> 00:01:04.066
Remember to give some invitations when you go back?

26
00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.166
Let's go

27
00:01:12.966 --> 00:01:15.500
Hey, you're back, why haven't you slept yet?

28
00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.733
I just heard on the phone that you had an accident.

29
00:01:17.733 --> 00:01:19.066
We were dying.

30
00:01:19.066 --> 00:01:20.066
Yes!

31
00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.300
Thank you.

32
00:01:23.166 --> 00:01:25.766
You're welcome, aren't we good sisters?

33
00:01:25.866 --> 00:01:29.700
Yes, you are the best, hahaha.
