00:00:02.366 --> 00:00:04.266
Sister Luo Ying, how is my dad?

2
00:00:04.366 --> 00:00:05.533
The surgery was a success.

3
00:00:05.533 --> 00:00:07.066
Uncle is safe

4
00:00:07.133 --> 00:00:09.333
Really? That's great, Sister Luo Ying

5
00:00:09.333 --> 00:00:11.033
My dad is finally okay

6
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:14.900
That's not possible.

7
00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:18.366
I think you said that because you were afraid of an accident

8
00:00:18.933 --> 00:00:21.966
Dean, I think you should call the security

9
00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.466
Then you can go in and check it out yourself.

10
00:00:25.266 --> 00:00:28.000
Otherwise, I'm afraid some people will escape from here

11
00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.566
Still stubborn

12
00:00:31.066 --> 00:00:32.366
I just heard

13
00:00:32.366 --> 00:00:35.066
Someone wants to kowtow to my senior sister and worship her teacher?

14
00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.166
Then how can I be considered your uncle?

15
00:00:37.166 --> 00:00:38.966
Listen to my uncle's advice

16
00:00:38.966 --> 00:00:41.000
Keep your head down

17
00:00:41.133 --> 00:00:42.066
Pardon me?

18
00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.866
Boy, I don't know you right now

19
00:00:46.133 --> 00:00:48.000
What will happen to the patient in a while?

20
00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:49.666
See how I treat you

21
00:00:50.133 --> 00:00:52.366
Quit Dr. Luo?

22
00:00:52.366 --> 00:00:54.933
Something happened in the operating room?

23
00:00:54.933 --> 00:00:56.900
Medical malpractice at best

24
00:00:57.133 --> 00:01:00.233
But some people are not even doctors

25
00:01:00.966 --> 00:01:05.100
If something goes wrong, I'm afraid I have to wear the old bottom

26
00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.433
The director doesn't believe it

27
00:01:07.933 --> 00:01:10.166
Dean, you can go in and have a look

28
00:01:12.566 --> 00:01:13.366
OK

29
00:01:16.166 --> 00:01:18.566
Don't worry, you still don't believe my senior sister.

30
00:01:18.566 --> 00:01:21.700
Miss Zhong, you have to take good care of people

31
00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.433
If you run away in a while, don't blame me for not reminding you

32
00:01:26.066 --> 00:01:28.733
Teacher, how about the two of us make a bet?

33
00:01:28.733 --> 00:01:30.800
What do you read?

34
00:01:30.866 --> 00:01:31.766
Very simple.

35
00:01:31.966 --> 00:01:34.700
Didn't you just kowtow to my senior sister?

36
00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.200
If my senior sister really cured the patient

37
00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.500
You give me one too

38
00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.200
Anyway, am I your uncle?

39
00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.233
You don't lose either.

40
00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.866
Okay, bet if you lose

41
00:01:44.866 --> 00:01:46.566
Just kowtow three times on the ground

42
00:01:46.566 --> 00:01:49.266
Then turn yourself in, no problem
