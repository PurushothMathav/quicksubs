President Liu

2
00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:03.966
You have to take a good look at this thing

3
00:00:04.766 --> 00:00:06.666
Impossible absolutely impossible

4
00:00:06.666 --> 00:00:08.100
How can there be two seals?

5
00:00:08.333 --> 00:00:08.966
President Liu

6
00:00:08.966 --> 00:00:11.866
I never said anything about this seal from the beginning

7
00:00:11.933 --> 00:00:14.433
Only one?

8
00:00:14.866 --> 00:00:16.900
This one in your hand is real.

9
00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:19.966
This one in my hand is also real.

10
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.066
I've never seen two stamps

11
00:00:22.066 --> 00:00:25.533
Old man, the cost of your seal is not good.

12
00:00:25.533 --> 00:00:28.500
Young people are young people

13
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.566
Doing things rough

14
00:00:30.566 --> 00:00:32.533
Not fully prepared

15
00:00:32.533 --> 00:00:34.466
Just come out and pretend to be someone else

16
00:00:34.666 --> 00:00:39.500
Today I will expose you.

17
00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:44.000
When the tiger was making this seal

18
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.766
I specially made two

19
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.233
After all, it's a good thing in pairs

20
00:00:49.533 --> 00:00:52.800
But then the old master's studio was humid

21
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
It wasn't just the paintings that were revealed.

22
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.733
and

23
00:00:56.733 --> 00:01:00.033
Even the seal in the studio was revealed

24
00:01:00.166 --> 00:01:02.566
It's just that the old man is indifferent to fame and fortune

25
00:01:02.566 --> 00:01:04.800
Did not pursue the matter

26
00:01:04.866 --> 00:01:07.200
Saw this seal today

27
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.000
So...

28
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.000
The old man had to come and mention this matter again

29
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.800
Ha ok

30
00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:14.766
Chu Feng

31
00:01:14.966 --> 00:01:17.533
Although I don't know how you bought Qinghe

32
00:01:17.533 --> 00:01:19.266
That guy accompanies you to act

33
00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:22.533
But today the real Mr. Yunmo is here

34
00:01:22.533 --> 00:01:24.766
Please pack one for me to see.

35
00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:29.400
Even you deserve to call me Mr. Yunmo

36
00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.600
So he stole Mr.'s seal?

37
00:01:33.266 --> 00:01:35.200
Hum oops sir

38
00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.500
It seems that I misunderstood you just now.

39
00:01:37.966 --> 00:01:39.666
I blame this kid for misleading me

40
00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:40.600
brat

41
00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.333
Steal something and steal it on Mr. Yunmo's head?

42
00:01:43.333 --> 00:01:44.800
How dare you!

43
00:01:48.266 --> 00:01:51.800
Ok ok ok I know who your old boy is
