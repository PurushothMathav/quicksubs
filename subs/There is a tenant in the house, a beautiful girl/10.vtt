00:00:02.133 --> 00:00:03.766
Today, Mr. Lin is not going to announce

2
00:00:03.766 --> 00:00:05.433
Let him get engaged to Wang Shao?

3
00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:07.666
Why did he bring a man here?

4
00:00:07.666 --> 00:00:10.466
Yes, no wonder Wang Shao is so angry today

5
00:00:10.466 --> 00:00:12.600
I think this neighbor is going to be out of luck.

6
00:00:13.066 --> 00:00:15.000
Who is Tomson?

7
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.400
Your granddaughter's boyfriend, of course.

8
00:00:17.533 --> 00:00:19.566
You Lin Qian are so brave

9
00:00:19.566 --> 00:00:22.600
How dare you play with this young master? What?

10
00:00:24.266 --> 00:00:25.800
Goddamn thing

11
00:00:26.566 --> 00:00:28.466
Wang Shao, don't worry.

12
00:00:28.533 --> 00:00:30.900
I will definitely give you an explanation.

13
00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.933
Grandpa, he is my boyfriend Chu Feng

14
00:00:33.933 --> 00:00:36.300
I don't want to fight with Wang Shao

15
00:00:37.566 --> 00:00:40.733
God, he dares to break the marriage

16
00:00:40.733 --> 00:00:41.766
Is he crazy?

17
00:00:41.766 --> 00:00:43.766
The Lin family is currently in an economic crisis

18
00:00:43.766 --> 00:00:46.166
When I was all counting on the Wang family for help

19
00:00:46.166 --> 00:00:47.266
He said so

20
00:00:47.266 --> 00:00:49.100
I'm afraid the Lin family is going to end

21
00:00:49.266 --> 00:00:52.500
The Lord said that he had never heard of any big family surnamed Chu

22
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.133
Shouldn't it be someone who is not three or four?

23
00:00:54.133 --> 00:00:55.766
Oh, you.

24
00:00:57.866 --> 00:00:58.866
Oops baby

25
00:00:59.533 --> 00:01:01.833
bored bored

26
00:01:02.166 --> 00:01:03.566
Do you know what you're saying?

27
00:01:03.566 --> 00:01:04.200
Ah!

28
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:07.000
Today is a big day for you and Wang Shaoding Fu

29
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.966
It's fine if you don't have a ceremony with him

30
00:01:08.966 --> 00:01:12.100
You even got a yakuza to piss me off

31
00:01:12.533 --> 00:01:15.200
Look what you got!

32
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.966
Wearing a lot of street goods

33
00:01:16.966 --> 00:01:20.133
I'm afraid I can't even get a line gesture out

34
00:01:20.133 --> 00:01:24.033
Ah, what is he comparing with Wang Shou?

35
00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.066
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

36
00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.100
You quickly apologize to grandpa and Wang Shao

37
00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.066
It just passed.

38
00:01:31.266 --> 00:01:32.200
I do not

39
00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.000
bastard
