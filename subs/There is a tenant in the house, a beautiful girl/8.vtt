00:00:01.333 --> 00:00:02.700
What are you doing?

2
00:00:02.933 --> 00:00:03.800
Live stream delivery

3
00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:07.066
Um, hi.

4
00:00:07.966 --> 00:00:10.400
Well, there's a little yellow cart below me.

5
00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:11.766
I didn't expect it.

6
00:00:12.666 --> 00:00:14.700
Usually so careless alone

7
00:00:14.766 --> 00:00:16.366
There is something wrong in front of the screen

8
00:00:16.533 --> 00:00:18.366
Look at your sister-in-law's illness

9
00:00:18.866 --> 00:00:20.500
Just help you

10
00:00:21.766 --> 00:00:24.000
You give me a high jump

11
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.200
I bought all your stuff.

12
00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:28.566
What!

13
00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:31.700
I'll dance for you and you'll buy everything

14
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.233
But I can't dance

15
00:00:37.366 --> 00:00:38.966
And I'm not an entertainment anchor either.

16
00:00:40.333 --> 00:00:42.300
Sorry about that.

17
00:00:43.333 --> 00:00:45.700
Hey, don't go, don't go, don't go

18
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.566
Well, let me try, let me try, don't go, don't go

19
00:00:51.766 --> 00:00:54.933
But... but I'm not very good at dancing.

20
00:00:54.933 --> 00:00:56.766
And you'll have a look at it.

21
00:00:56.966 --> 00:00:59.700
Ah, but thank you for your support, Brother West Wind.

22
00:01:01.866 --> 00:01:04.433
I'll give you q meters with a knife.

23
00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:08.833
Give it all to Hope Primary School

24
00:01:10.666 --> 00:01:12.300
Sleep

25
00:01:19.266 --> 00:01:21.733
Well, why don't you sleep at night?

26
00:01:21.733 --> 00:01:23.100
Go upstairs to sleep

27
00:01:23.566 --> 00:01:27.266
Sister Luoying, come here, I have something to ask you.

28
00:01:28.333 --> 00:01:30.400
Sit down, you say

29
00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.966
I have a friend

30
00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.000
He accidentally slept with his boyfriend yesterday.

31
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.400
Will he get pregnant?

32
00:01:39.166 --> 00:01:41.166
I don't know.

33
00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:44.666
Most people have a hard time getting pregnant for the first time

34
00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:47.966
And if you want to conceive, you must do it well

35
00:01:48.333 --> 00:01:50.166
Be well prepared

36
00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.666
What if he drinks and takes medicine?

37
00:01:54.466 --> 00:01:56.333
So the adoption rate is even lower.

38
00:01:56.333 --> 00:01:58.500
Hey, you have to know that you are pregnant?

39
00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.066
It has to be in the right place at the right time.

40
00:02:01.266 --> 00:02:03.366
Even couples who have been together for a long time

41
00:02:03.366 --> 00:02:05.766
It doesn't mean that you can pay it back if you want.

42
00:02:06.333 --> 00:02:07.233
Hey master

43
00:02:07.866 --> 00:02:09.666
We only have 4 sisters in total

44
00:02:09.666 --> 00:02:11.800
When did you make a new friend?

45
00:02:12.533 --> 00:02:13.566
Nope.

46
00:02:14.366 --> 00:02:17.433
Could it be Zhong Yao and Qing Wan?

47
00:02:17.666 --> 00:02:20.500
Hey, no, they don't have a partner.

48
00:02:20.666 --> 00:02:21.966
No no

49
00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.500
It's poetry.

50
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.500
Is this person you're talking about?
