00:00:00.733 --> 00:00:02.166
What if I can't?

2
00:00:02.166 --> 00:00:05.866
It can only be said that this patient has no one to treat

3
00:00:06.266 --> 00:00:09.166
Ah, this one?

4
00:00:09.166 --> 00:00:10.200
Doctor Gao?

5
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.766
It looks really good.

6
00:00:12.333 --> 00:00:13.566
Isn't that amazing?

7
00:00:13.566 --> 00:00:16.000
It's not something you can just say

8
00:00:16.266 --> 00:00:17.600
What do you mean?

9
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:19.066
My meaning is very simple.

10
00:00:19.166 --> 00:00:20.733
If your surgery fails later

11
00:00:20.733 --> 00:00:22.266
I have to let my senior sister wipe the skin

12
00:00:22.666 --> 00:00:25.000
What if something bad happens to this patient?

13
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.166
There's nothing we can do.

14
00:00:26.166 --> 00:00:28.066
Can you take responsibility for this?

15
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:32.433
It's useless to say so much here now

16
00:00:32.933 --> 00:00:35.766
Since this gentleman looks down on Doctor Gao

17
00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:37.966
Then let's speak with facts

18
00:00:37.966 --> 00:00:38.600
Prepare for surgery

19
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.466
You haven't answered my question yet.

20
00:00:40.666 --> 00:00:44.233
I ask if you can take this responsibility

21
00:00:44.766 --> 00:00:46.766
Doctor Gao was invited by me

22
00:00:46.766 --> 00:00:48.300
If there is any problem

23
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.366
I'll take care of it.

24
00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.766
Ok ok let's go

25
00:00:56.666 --> 00:00:58.333
I'm going to bring my sister

26
00:00:58.333 --> 00:01:00.066
I think you need to prepare

27
00:01:00.066 --> 00:01:01.966
In case this person is fishing for jade despite his name

28
00:01:02.366 --> 00:01:03.633
You have to go to the rescue

29
00:01:06.266 --> 00:01:07.233
Oh uncle

30
00:01:07.533 --> 00:01:09.133
Is this surgery really that simple?

31
00:01:09.133 --> 00:01:11.000
Ah, if I mess up

32
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.333
I'm afraid that those people outside will make a fuss.

33
00:01:13.333 --> 00:01:16.466
What are you afraid of? You are also a sea turtle MD

34
00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:18.433
The surgery was perfect

35
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.833
As long as you follow the surgery strictly according to the plan

36
00:01:20.966 --> 00:01:22.700
It will soar into the sky in the future

37
00:01:22.733 --> 00:01:25.333
Plus I'm vigilant behind your back

38
00:01:25.333 --> 00:01:26.600
A small promise

39
00:01:26.666 --> 00:01:27.900
Definitely not a problem.

40
00:01:28.766 --> 00:01:31.833
OK, let's get started, let's go

41
00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:56.466
Oh oh it's over oh it's over
