00:00:00.966 --> 00:00:03.033
Why is Mr. Yunmo's seal with you?

2
00:00:03.066 --> 00:00:05.133
President Yao, you should know

3
00:00:05.133 --> 00:00:07.766
Mr. Yun Mo's seal never leaves his hands

4
00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:09.266
I don't have to explain.

5
00:00:09.866 --> 00:00:10.866
Mr. Yun Mo

6
00:00:11.066 --> 00:00:12.500
Please explain to me.

7
00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.233
Why does this kid have your seal?

8
00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:16.133
President Liu

9
00:00:16.133 --> 00:00:18.600
Could it be that you think he took out a seal

10
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.833
Can you pretend to be me?

11
00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.933
Yes, this kid must be fake

12
00:00:23.933 --> 00:00:27.500
Hey, maybe the seal in his hand is also fake.

13
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:28.766
Clean him up

14
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.666
President Liu, I'm standing here

15
00:00:31.666 --> 00:00:34.233
But don't blame me for not reminding you.

16
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.833
What is the identity of Mr. Yuan Mo, you should know

17
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.566
Against you, the president of a small painting and calligraphy association

18
00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.266
Sir please explain to me

19
00:00:44.266 --> 00:00:45.700
Otherwise today

20
00:00:46.766 --> 00:00:48.100
Hum chairperson

21
00:00:48.933 --> 00:00:50.166
You are so timid

22
00:00:50.166 --> 00:00:51.800
I don't even know how you sit

23
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.300
At this location today

24
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.700
Since you want to know so much

25
00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:00.000
Then I'll tell you this seal is not real.

26
00:01:03.133 --> 00:01:04.366
Little brother oh no

27
00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:05.366
Mr. Yun Mo

28
00:01:05.733 --> 00:01:07.466
I really don't know about this

29
00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:08.500
How offended I am

30
00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:09.633
I hope you'll forgive me.

31
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.300
Why don't you kneel down and apologize to your husband?

32
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:13.400
Dad?

33
00:01:13.766 --> 00:01:15.233
You asked me to apologize to him

34
00:01:15.566 --> 00:01:16.500
How is that possible?

35
00:01:16.766 --> 00:01:19.800
The brat is out there making trouble for me all day

36
00:01:20.066 --> 00:01:21.866
Let him offend Mr. Yunuo today

37
00:01:21.933 --> 00:01:23.700
Kneel down and apologize

38
00:01:25.066 --> 00:01:27.900
President Liu, I haven't finished speaking yet

39
00:01:28.066 --> 00:01:29.766
You are so courteous

40
00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:33.966
All right, I'll show you these things.
