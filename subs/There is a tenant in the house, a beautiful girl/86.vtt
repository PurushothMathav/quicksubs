00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:03.600
What do you say, the old man salted the fish with a crane?

2
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:04.900
Where did the son come from

3
00:00:05.966 --> 00:00:08.400
Wonderful, wonderful

4
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.300
Hey, old man, your reaction is quite fast

5
00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:12.166
I don't even want a son so soon

6
00:00:12.166 --> 00:00:14.133
What did you say, main peak?

7
00:00:14.133 --> 00:00:15.966
You two know each other?

8
00:00:16.466 --> 00:00:17.666
It's okay not to admit it.

9
00:00:22.966 --> 00:00:24.966
Jin Hao helped me find someone

10
00:00:24.966 --> 00:00:26.833
I'll send the information to your phone in a while.

11
00:00:27.166 --> 00:00:28.800
Can't find it in five minutes

12
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.500
Don't say you know me

13
00:00:30.766 --> 00:00:33.266
Hmm, you're still pretending here

14
00:00:33.333 --> 00:00:35.800
Do you think Qinghe can come to rescue you today?

15
00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.266
I'll tell you what.

16
00:00:37.333 --> 00:00:38.533
Although Qinghe is amazing

17
00:00:38.533 --> 00:00:40.566
But in front of Master Yun Mo

18
00:00:40.566 --> 00:00:43.666
His words can make Qinghe roll out of the calligraphy world

19
00:00:44.133 --> 00:00:45.266
That's all.

20
00:00:45.866 --> 00:00:48.233
Young people are obsessed

21
00:00:48.466 --> 00:00:51.400
There must be no repentance

22
00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:54.133
President Liu, I'll leave it to you to handle here.

23
00:00:54.133 --> 00:00:55.400
I'm going back to rest.

24
00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:56.233
Stop

25
00:00:56.766 --> 00:00:59.266
Is it too late to leave now?

26
00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:01.600
So what's going on?

27
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.600
He's not some kind of fossil.

28
00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.466
Just a son who engraves seals

29
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.566
Son of the Seal

30
00:01:09.566 --> 00:01:11.933
So who is this with you two?

31
00:01:11.933 --> 00:01:14.033
What does Master Yun Mo have to do with it?

32
00:01:14.466 --> 00:01:16.433
Lao Wu, you are talking to me

33
00:01:16.666 --> 00:01:18.566
Go ahead, kid.

34
00:01:18.566 --> 00:01:21.400
I see what reason you can come up with

35
00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.966
Okay, then I said it.

36
00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:25.666
I'm still curious

37
00:01:26.166 --> 00:01:28.600
How can there be two identical seals?

38
00:01:28.933 --> 00:01:30.600
I just thought about it for a long time

39
00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.166
I'm thinking about when the seal was engraved at that time

40
00:01:33.166 --> 00:01:34.633
Sculpting is a habit

41
00:01:34.666 --> 00:01:37.466
He likes to carve two identical seals

42
00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:40.700
One for collection

43
00:01:40.733 --> 00:01:42.633
Give one to the guest

44
00:01:43.266 --> 00:01:45.700
I've felt familiar since you walked in the door

45
00:01:45.866 --> 00:01:47.100
I thought about it for a long time

46
00:01:47.333 --> 00:01:50.566
It turns out that you are very similar to that carving room.

47
00:01:50.966 --> 00:01:53.466
Old Wu, do you think I'm right?

48
00:01:53.466 --> 00:01:54.900
Humph ridiculous

49
00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.900
This is nonsense.

50
00:01:56.966 --> 00:01:59.700
You dare to slander the old man, President Liu

51
00:02:01.366 --> 00:02:02.366
Liu Jianzhang

52
00:02:02.366 --> 00:02:05.100
My master of Qinghe, try to move it.
