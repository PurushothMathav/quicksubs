Your favorite streamer is live.

2
00:00:11.066 --> 00:00:13.800
The money I bought last time is probably not enough.

3
00:00:14.366 --> 00:00:16.900
Forget it, good people do it to the end

4
00:00:29.466 --> 00:00:32.066
I asked Chu Feng to do me such a big favor yesterday

5
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.566
Today I'm going to cook a meal and take a good look at my wife

6
00:00:35.933 --> 00:00:39.000
But I can't cook.

7
00:00:39.066 --> 00:00:41.600
Forget it, you can't eat dead people anyway

8
00:00:48.533 --> 00:00:49.600
What's that smell?

9
00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.966
Hmm, is there still any food in my pot?

10
00:01:44.733 --> 00:01:47.566
The weather is nice today, yeah.

11
00:01:48.666 --> 00:01:49.933
What about cooking?

12
00:01:49.933 --> 00:01:51.100
Me oh

13
00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:53.400
Why don't I do it?

14
00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.966
You believe me

15
00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:00.600
Thanks.

16
00:02:00.866 --> 00:02:03.100
The feeling of hugging Chu Feng just now

17
00:02:03.366 --> 00:02:06.300
Why are you so similar to the person from that night?

18
00:02:07.333 --> 00:02:09.600
Lin Shishi, what are you thinking?

19
00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.266
Chu Feng helped you yesterday

20
00:02:11.366 --> 00:02:14.166
How could it be the villain in the position of the right woman?
