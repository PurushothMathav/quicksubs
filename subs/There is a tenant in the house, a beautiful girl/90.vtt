00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:01.866
Hometown

2
00:00:02.133 --> 00:00:02.900
And Mr. Mo

3
00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:03.966
I'm so sorry.

4
00:00:03.966 --> 00:00:05.600
I was also deceived by this old guy

5
00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:07.300
Plus my unsatisfactory son

6
00:00:07.366 --> 00:00:09.566
I'm sorry, I'm sorry

7
00:00:09.566 --> 00:00:10.600
President Liu

8
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.666
You can solve the problem with a word of forgiveness, right?

9
00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:15.700
Although my master is easy to talk to

10
00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:19.000
But don't forget about me.

11
00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:21.000
I didn't say I'm easy to talk to

12
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:22.866
Such a fool

13
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.166
I have to kill him today

14
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.400
Mr. Qinghe is right

15
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:28.600
You just ask.

16
00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.766
As long as Liu can do it, he will be satisfied

17
00:00:31.366 --> 00:00:32.300
Jianghuai

18
00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:34.466
President Liu didn't do it on purpose

19
00:00:34.466 --> 00:00:36.566
How could you get him to 5 million?

20
00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:38.500
Hey

21
00:00:38.566 --> 00:00:41.766
You also asked President Liu to give me half of the collection

22
00:00:41.766 --> 00:00:42.533
This is not good

23
00:00:42.533 --> 00:00:43.866
Too expensive

24
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.033
Mr. Book

25
00:00:45.133 --> 00:00:46.833
5 million delivered immediately

26
00:00:47.066 --> 00:00:49.366
As long as you like my stuff

27
00:00:49.366 --> 00:00:50.500
It's the privilege of avoiding people

28
00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:53.166
Ah, what are you doing? You apologize for your visa.

29
00:00:53.333 --> 00:00:55.166
Kneel down, nephew Qian

30
00:00:55.266 --> 00:00:56.800
Now you know I'm good

31
00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.733
I'm sorry, okay?

32
00:00:58.733 --> 00:01:00.666
Now that this is the case

33
00:01:00.666 --> 00:01:02.800
Then I'll pretend it didn't happen.

34
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.666
You must send this old house to me.

35
00:01:04.666 --> 00:01:06.100
I promised Master Wu

36
00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:07.500
Sir, don't worry.

37
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.600
Give it to me

38
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.000
Let's go

39
00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:17.700
handshake

40
00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.100
I know all about you

41
00:01:21.666 --> 00:01:23.433
Let me ask you something.

42
00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:24.966
Do you want revenge?

43
00:01:25.066 --> 00:01:27.900
I won't let you go, guy.

44
00:01:28.133 --> 00:01:29.566
Now you listen

45
00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.100
I happen to have something for you to do right now.

46
00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:33.233
Escape from my life

47
00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.466
Revenge you just commit crimes
