00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.833
Senior sister and brother, good evening

2
00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:24.833
Why are you sweating so much at night?

3
00:00:25.366 --> 00:00:27.700
If you are not feeling well, I will show you.

4
00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.200
Can't sleep?

5
00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.566
The air conditioner is getting hot at night

6
00:00:35.333 --> 00:00:38.233
Is there anything wrong with Senior Sister coming to my room?

7
00:00:38.933 --> 00:00:42.166
Senior sister can't come to you if there is nothing wrong

8
00:00:42.866 --> 00:00:43.666
Senior sister

9
00:00:44.066 --> 00:00:48.466
When you were a child, you really slept with your senior sister

10
00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:51.866
Why now?

11
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.166
Suddenly forgot

12
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.966
Did you not understand when you were a child?

13
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.033
fooling around

14
00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.066
Look at you scare me

15
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:02.400
I came today.

16
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.866
I want to tell you something very important

17
00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.500
If there is anything in the world, just tell me

18
00:01:07.533 --> 00:01:09.000
Just like a secretary

19
00:01:09.666 --> 00:01:10.733
You have to go

20
00:01:10.733 --> 00:01:12.833
You have to go

21
00:01:13.566 --> 00:01:15.866
Hey, what didn't Senior Sister say?

22
00:01:19.666 --> 00:01:22.433
Oh no no no

23
00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:32.933
As soon as he told me today

24
00:01:32.933 --> 00:01:35.166
Invitations will be sent to the four major families

25
00:01:35.266 --> 00:01:37.400
And I did get a call.

26
00:01:40.866 --> 00:01:42.866
He couldn't have helped me, could he?

27
00:01:44.566 --> 00:01:46.400
I went in and asked directly

28
00:01:46.666 --> 00:01:48.666
Isn't that a little too abrupt?

29
00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:50.966
Do it understand

30
00:01:55.333 --> 00:01:57.900
No matter what, I just go in and invite him.

31
00:01:57.933 --> 00:02:00.633
He'll know then.

32
00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.066
I knew it was you.

33
00:02:09.066 --> 00:02:10.800
What are you doing in the kitchen?

34
00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.033
I couldn't sleep.

35
00:02:13.866 --> 00:02:14.900
Look at the scenery

36
00:02:19.133 --> 00:02:20.800
You shouldn't be

37
00:02:21.366 --> 00:02:23.400
Are you hiding someone in the house?

38
00:02:23.766 --> 00:02:25.166
Drinking Tibetans

39
00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.200
The whole thing has not been found many times.
