1
00:00:00.466 --> 00:00:01.766
But as far as I know

2
00:00:02.466 --> 00:00:04.133
Mr. Yun Mo has been in recent years

3
00:00:04.133 --> 00:00:06.233
No paintings have come out yet.

4
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:07.866
This painting

5
00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:11.833
It seems that the painting does not exceed three days

6
00:00:12.733 --> 00:00:14.033
Must be fake

7
00:00:14.333 --> 00:00:15.566
Miss Song

8
00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:17.000
Excuse me.

9
00:00:17.133 --> 00:00:21.100
Is the person who indulged Mr. Yun Mo himself?

10
00:00:21.366 --> 00:00:25.166
Did I guess wrong?

11
00:00:27.666 --> 00:00:31.833
Ah, then this must be false

12
00:00:32.566 --> 00:00:33.366
qiuwan

13
00:00:33.566 --> 00:00:36.166
This painting was given to you by that brat, right?

14
00:00:36.166 --> 00:00:39.400
I already said he was a liar

15
00:00:39.666 --> 00:00:42.533
Today, I invited Master Qinghe to come over

16
00:00:42.533 --> 00:00:44.333
Just to give you an appreciation of this painting

17
00:00:44.333 --> 00:00:46.500
I'm afraid you will be deceived.

18
00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.900
Master Qinghe has already seen your work

19
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.766
Today, as long as you agree

20
00:00:51.766 --> 00:00:55.033
Master Qinghe can accept you as a closed disciple

21
00:00:56.866 --> 00:00:57.666
Autumn

22
00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.633
Although Master Qinghe is a little different from Master Yunmo

23
00:01:00.733 --> 00:01:02.533
But I can still help you.

24
00:01:02.533 --> 00:01:05.033
You are really haunted

25
00:01:05.066 --> 00:01:07.633
I brought such a thing here again today to be funny

26
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.666
Why are you here?

27
00:01:09.933 --> 00:01:12.166
Didn't you buy a painting for your room two days ago?

28
00:01:12.166 --> 00:01:13.766
I accidentally gave it away.

29
00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.266
I want to come to you to empty it for free.

30
00:01:16.333 --> 00:01:18.066
Who knows it hasn't come in yet?

31
00:01:18.066 --> 00:01:20.200
I heard someone fooling people here

32
00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.633
Boy what do you mean

33
00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.066
Do you despise Qinghe?

34
00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.600
Yes, I just look down on you

35
00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.433
Presumptuous boy

36
00:01:30.533 --> 00:01:34.100
Master Qinghe is one of the top ten painters on the list

37
00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.333
Except for Master Yun Mo

38
00:01:36.333 --> 00:01:39.566
No one dares to say that they can crush Master Qinghe

39
00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:40.100
clear

40
00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.766
If Wan can become Master Qinghe's closed disciple

41
00:01:42.766 --> 00:01:45.000
Whether it is speech or identity

42
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.133
White paper dry head goes further?

43
00:01:47.133 --> 00:01:51.500
You said his first 11 thieves
