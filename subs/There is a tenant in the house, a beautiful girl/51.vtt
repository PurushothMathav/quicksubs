00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.633
What is he really Mr. Yun Mo?

2
00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:07.366
Didn't you just say Mr. Yunmo?

3
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.966
Pioneer Dogu, have you ever exchanged experiences with him?

4
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.066
I'm so sorry, Miss Song.

5
00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:16.066
I'm just trying to make a name for myself

6
00:00:16.866 --> 00:00:18.366
Did you lie?

7
00:00:18.366 --> 00:00:20.366
You are really Mr. Yunmo

8
00:00:20.666 --> 00:00:21.466
Ah.

9
00:00:22.133 --> 00:00:23.600
It's me it's me

10
00:00:23.933 --> 00:00:26.233
Tell me what's going on

11
00:00:26.366 --> 00:00:27.633
It's not because of him

12
00:00:27.933 --> 00:00:29.466
I think I was up in the mountains.

13
00:00:29.466 --> 00:00:32.100
I often draw stipples for the village children at the foot of the mountain

14
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:33.000
Write some couplets

15
00:00:33.133 --> 00:00:34.300
Would you like something to eat?

16
00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.833
He stole paintings from the children

17
00:00:36.933 --> 00:00:38.433
I got caught

18
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.233
You must take me as your teacher

19
00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.766
I can't come up with a random name

20
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.400
Who knew I was so famous outside?

21
00:00:48.533 --> 00:00:53.166
The legendary master Yun Mo who saw the tail of the dragon and couldn't see his hands

22
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:54.600
It's really you?

23
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:55.433
Hey.

24
00:00:56.166 --> 00:00:58.133
I suddenly remembered that my clothes at home have not been collected yet.

25
00:00:58.133 --> 00:00:59.500
Oh, master?

26
00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:00.500
I'll go first

27
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.133
Ah that

28
00:01:03.133 --> 00:01:04.100
I have something else to do

29
00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.400
I'll go first.

30
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.766
I'll just say what you said, Mr. Yunmo

31
00:01:08.766 --> 00:01:10.133
No one else can see it

32
00:01:10.133 --> 00:01:10.933
Are you still beautiful?

33
00:01:10.933 --> 00:01:11.800
Oops it hurts

34
00:01:11.866 --> 00:01:13.800
I'm not finished with you, hey, hey.

35
00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.733
Why didn't it work?

36
00:01:19.733 --> 00:01:21.733
No, it's that bastard named Chu again

37
00:01:21.733 --> 00:01:23.800
I didn't expect Qinghe to know him

38
00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:25.866
The surname is Chu, what is his name?

39
00:01:25.866 --> 00:01:29.800
Called Chu Feng, could it be that Wang Shao knows him?

40
00:01:30.366 --> 00:01:31.900
More than just knowing

41
00:01:32.533 --> 00:01:35.133
It's that guy who ruined my good deed

42
00:01:35.133 --> 00:01:38.966
I didn't expect that the bad Wang Shao was also this guy

43
00:01:38.966 --> 00:01:40.166
That being the case

44
00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.566
Then there's no need for this waste to exist

45
00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:47.833
This is the token of the underground emperor White Tiger

46
00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:49.866
He owes me a favor

47
00:01:50.133 --> 00:01:53.633
The birth of this token will definitely solve that waste
