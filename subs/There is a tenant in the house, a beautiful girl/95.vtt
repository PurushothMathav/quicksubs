1
00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:01.600
Stop

2
00:00:03.733 --> 00:00:04.533
charge

3
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:07.100
Wife

4
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.600
I didn't expect you to be so cruel

5
00:00:09.966 --> 00:00:12.500
Stop, if you play again, I won't go forward

6
00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.000
I'll blow them up

7
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.766
Magic, your royal family is gone

8
00:00:16.766 --> 00:00:18.333
You raise your hand to throw the gun now and I can let it go

9
00:00:18.333 --> 00:00:20.233
You shut up

10
00:00:20.466 --> 00:00:22.633
It's because my Wang family is gone

11
00:00:22.666 --> 00:00:26.066
I want to pull you to bury the main peak together today

12
00:00:26.533 --> 00:00:27.400
You kneel down for me

13
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:28.533
You kneel down for me

14
00:00:28.533 --> 00:00:30.133
Otherwise I'll blow them up

15
00:00:30.133 --> 00:00:33.900
Chu Feng doesn't want you to leave us alone, junior brother, go away

16
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:36.100
Chu Feng can't be cheap for them

17
00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.366
Chu Feng and the others want to exchange me for the order.

18
00:00:38.366 --> 00:00:39.266
I'm all right.

19
00:00:39.266 --> 00:00:40.433
You should go

20
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.300
Magic, I can promise you anything you want

21
00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:44.500
As long as you let him go

22
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:45.300
Housewife

23
00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:48.766
What do you give me for our Wang family's self-produced business?

24
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.100
There's 100 million in this card.

25
00:00:51.166 --> 00:00:52.366
As long as you want

26
00:00:52.366 --> 00:00:53.666
You can take it immediately.

27
00:00:54.933 --> 00:00:56.900
If you say there is 100 million, there is 100 million.

28
00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:59.300
Why should I believe Mr. There are so many people

29
00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.400
Just try it and you'll know. Try it.

30
00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:05.433
Oh, Wang Chao.

31
00:01:05.666 --> 00:01:06.966
It's a billion.

32
00:01:08.133 --> 00:01:10.700
Yo, I didn't expect you, bumpkin

33
00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.400
Really so rich

34
00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:13.866
Get the money and get out

35
00:01:15.966 --> 00:01:19.066
It's not enough to get rid of me with just this money

36
00:01:19.066 --> 00:01:21.500
Lao Tzu wants hundreds of billions of orders

37
00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:22.500
I want 100 billion.

38
00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:23.700
Can you afford it?

39
00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.166
As long as you let them go

40
00:01:25.366 --> 00:01:26.666
I can give you as much as you want.

41
00:01:26.666 --> 00:01:27.466
Xiaofang

42
00:01:27.866 --> 00:01:30.533
I admitted before that I underestimated you a bit.

43
00:01:30.533 --> 00:01:31.966
But you remember

44
00:01:31.966 --> 00:01:34.466
I want 100 billion.

45
00:01:34.466 --> 00:01:37.000
How do you give it to me?
