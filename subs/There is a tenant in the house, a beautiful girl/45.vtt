1
00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.633
What kind of person is Mr. Yun Mo?

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.333
Why did Chu Feng say that?

3
00:00:05.333 --> 00:00:08.066
Will be so connected to Mr. Yunmo's

4
00:00:08.066 --> 00:00:10.566
Liu Xiong, they can't tell the difference

5
00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:13.000
Tonight?

6
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:17.666
Why is it you again?

7
00:00:17.666 --> 00:00:19.900
Look who I brought you

8
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.166
This is Wan

9
00:00:22.266 --> 00:00:25.166
This is a distinguished member of the Calligraphy and Painting Association

10
00:00:25.166 --> 00:00:26.633
Master Qinghe

11
00:00:26.733 --> 00:00:28.800
The status of Master Qinghe is noble

12
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.200
Even my father has to be respectful when he sees it

13
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:31.933
baggage

14
00:00:31.933 --> 00:00:34.366
I went to a lot of trouble to invite you here

15
00:00:40.566 --> 00:00:41.966
Master Qinghe

16
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.433
Is that Master Qinghe, the calligraphy appraisal expert?

17
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.566
Yes, it's below

18
00:00:50.266 --> 00:00:53.666
Qiu Wan, I talked to Master Qinghe today

19
00:00:53.666 --> 00:00:55.900
You have the original work of Master Yun Mo

20
00:00:55.966 --> 00:00:59.000
Master Qinghe and Master Yunmo have met before

21
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.833
We've had conversations.

22
00:01:00.866 --> 00:01:03.700
Today, I invited him to come and see this painting

23
00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.800
Is it true or false?

24
00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.866
I always feel that two paintings are exactly the same

25
00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:10.033
There are seven orifices

26
00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:11.366
Master Nanaga

27
00:01:11.366 --> 00:01:13.600
Have you really seen Master Yun Mo?

28
00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.033
Then what kind of person is he?

29
00:01:17.533 --> 00:01:18.666
Mr. Mo

30
00:01:19.566 --> 00:01:21.066
It must be Xianfeng Dao Bone

31
00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.900
Is it a character that I will never be able to uncover in my life?

32
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.800
Hey, when he stopped in the mountains

33
00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:31.000
I once met him

34
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.400
It was that conversation.

35
00:01:32.466 --> 00:01:33.266
Made me realize

36
00:01:33.266 --> 00:01:36.200
What's the difference between me and him?

37
00:01:36.733 --> 00:01:37.766
And so it did.

38
00:01:37.766 --> 00:01:39.966
People like Mr. Yun Mo

39
00:01:39.966 --> 00:01:42.100
It must be transcendent.

40
00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.066
Could you please take a look at the master?

41
00:01:45.066 --> 00:01:48.166
Is this painting by Mr. Yun Mo?

42
00:01:52.066 --> 00:01:54.033
Searching for a high ancient and elegant

43
00:01:54.266 --> 00:01:55.900
The pen is vigorous and powerful

44
00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:00.500
Look, it is indeed the handwriting of Master Yun Mo

45
00:02:00.566 --> 00:02:03.366
How is this possible?
