00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:04.766
Wow, it smells so good, Shishi

2
00:00:05.066 --> 00:00:06.733
You did all this.

3
00:00:06.733 --> 00:00:08.266
It's not me, it's Chu Fang

4
00:00:08.766 --> 00:00:11.533
Chu Fang, that rascal, can also cook

5
00:00:11.533 --> 00:00:13.566
Hmph, don't eat if you dislike me

6
00:00:14.466 --> 00:00:15.266
Who says

7
00:00:16.766 --> 00:00:17.600
Oh, dear.

8
00:00:20.533 --> 00:00:21.566
What are you busy with?

9
00:00:26.966 --> 00:00:27.766
OK

10
00:00:28.966 --> 00:00:32.666
I didn't expect you to cook so delicious!

11
00:00:32.733 --> 00:00:34.966
It's delicious

12
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.833
Zhong Yuntao's tumor is in a special location

13
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.000
Surgery is very risky

14
00:00:47.533 --> 00:00:48.400
you

15
00:00:48.966 --> 00:00:50.633
Is there a good plan?

16
00:00:51.733 --> 00:00:52.766
I think this

17
00:00:53.333 --> 00:00:56.000
The patient's condition plus age

18
00:00:56.666 --> 00:00:58.566
Surgery is not the best option

19
00:00:59.333 --> 00:01:01.500
Drug control should be carried out

20
00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:03.433
Do your best to prolong patient life

21
00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.033
This approach is currently the best solution

22
00:01:07.466 --> 00:01:08.766
Dr. Law

23
00:01:08.766 --> 00:01:09.766
What do you think?

24
00:01:10.133 --> 00:01:11.966
The patient is in serious condition

25
00:01:11.966 --> 00:01:15.633
Medication only lasts a year at most

26
00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.766
But Dean, you have a point. I

27
00:01:28.666 --> 00:01:31.800
Dean, I have now decided to operate on the patient

28
00:01:31.866 --> 00:01:35.400
Dr. Wei, this is the dean, look

29
00:01:35.666 --> 00:01:35.866
You see

30
00:01:35.866 --> 00:01:37.966
This plan was just sent to me by someone.

31
00:01:37.966 --> 00:01:40.766
This plan is the closest to the perfect plan at present

32
00:01:40.766 --> 00:01:42.233
As long as we follow him

33
00:01:42.533 --> 00:01:44.200
There's no danger at all.

34
00:01:44.566 --> 00:01:48.066
Who would have devised such an intravenous solution?

35
00:01:49.533 --> 00:01:52.100
Well, now that we have a plan

36
00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:56.333
You should schedule the surgery for the patient as soon as possible

37
00:01:56.333 --> 00:01:59.866
But this surgery is extremely demanding for the doctor

38
00:02:00.666 --> 00:02:03.033
Our hospital is afraid that it will be difficult to complete.

39
00:02:03.733 --> 00:02:06.000
Dean master

40
00:02:06.066 --> 00:02:08.500
I can do this. Okay.

41
00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:09.566
That being the case

42
00:02:09.566 --> 00:02:12.400
I'll leave this surgery to Dr. Luo. Okay?

43
00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.300
I'll arrange it now.
