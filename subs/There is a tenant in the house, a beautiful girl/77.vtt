00:00:02.466 --> 00:00:03.633
Ladies and gentlemen

2
00:00:03.866 --> 00:00:06.300
Are you sure you won't change your mind?

3
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:07.233
There are also opinions

4
00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.966
I admit that I admit that our royal family

5
00:00:09.966 --> 00:00:12.166
In the South Prison, it is not as good as the patriarchs

6
00:00:12.166 --> 00:00:13.533
But here it is.

7
00:00:13.533 --> 00:00:15.866
One acre and one third of our Wang family's land

8
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.666
You dare not provoke me

9
00:00:17.666 --> 00:00:21.200
If you are sure that the 100 billion will be handed over to the temporary division

10
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:24.566
I promise this 100 billion won't make his hand

11
00:00:24.566 --> 00:00:26.466
Haven't heard that in a long time

12
00:00:26.466 --> 00:00:27.800
Don't say your Wang family

13
00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.300
It's hard for all the families to add up

14
00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.200
No one dares to talk to us like that

15
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.633
You have the guts.

16
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.133
But listen up.

17
00:00:36.133 --> 00:00:38.466
If you let me know that you dealt with Miss Lin

18
00:00:38.533 --> 00:00:41.900
Your royal family will disappear within a day

19
00:00:42.166 --> 00:00:45.000
In my opinion, it is better to let the Wang family disappear now

20
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.866
Young people don't know the sky is high and the earth is thick

21
00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:48.633
Even I dare to threaten

22
00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:50.666
Why don't you destroy the Lin family first?

23
00:00:50.666 --> 00:00:53.900
Killing chickens into monkeys is the most effective

24
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.066
Hey Qingming Hero Lord

25
00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:57.766
Lin Jia knew she was wrong

26
00:00:57.766 --> 00:00:59.400
Please give me another chance.

27
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.100
Don't kill Lin Jia

28
00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.366
Ah you don't do that

29
00:01:03.366 --> 00:01:04.500
We can't afford it.

30
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.666
Originally, this order was your neighbor's house.

31
00:01:06.666 --> 00:01:07.966
We didn't have to come here.

32
00:01:07.966 --> 00:01:10.500
It was your neighbor who lost this opportunity

33
00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:11.666
No one else's to blame

34
00:01:11.666 --> 00:01:14.666
I, I, I, I, I lost the order, Dad.

35
00:01:15.333 --> 00:01:16.766
Is it at the birthday banquet?

36
00:01:16.933 --> 00:01:19.933
The white order given by Chu Feng?

37
00:01:19.933 --> 00:01:21.466
Your contract is real

38
00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.600
That 80 million gift is also real

39
00:01:24.466 --> 00:01:25.366
Hey

40
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:27.800
give up

41
00:01:28.266 --> 00:01:29.366
I'm gonna pass.

42
00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:31.300
Hey

43
00:01:33.466 --> 00:01:35.833
If I had known today, why did I have to
