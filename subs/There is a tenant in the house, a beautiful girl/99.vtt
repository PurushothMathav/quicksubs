00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:02.800
Chu Feng Chu Feng

2
00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:03.600
Chu

3
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:04.800
wind

4
00:00:07.566 --> 00:00:10.233
Damn let him escape again

5
00:00:10.566 --> 00:00:11.366
Yaoyao

6
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:14.333
Chu Feng is gone, you seem to be in a hurry

7
00:00:14.333 --> 00:00:15.900
No no no no

8
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.900
I didn't expect the prescription to be so powerful

9
00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:20.766
He takes care of me so much

10
00:00:20.766 --> 00:00:22.966
Gave me so much money again

11
00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:26.633
At the same time, he also promised me to go to the exquisite banquet together

12
00:00:27.066 --> 00:00:29.566
He must like me

13
00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:30.866
So to speak

14
00:00:30.866 --> 00:00:33.766
He must be ready to be my boyfriend

15
00:00:34.766 --> 00:00:36.833
Chu Feng is Mr. Yunmo

16
00:00:36.866 --> 00:00:39.600
Now there is such a layer of identity

17
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:43.566
Although I don't know why he is so helpful to the world

18
00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:47.033
But he was a talented, good man.

19
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:51.566
In order to help me, I also offended Liu Xiong earlier.

20
00:00:51.766 --> 00:00:55.000
Compared to him, it should be me

21
00:00:57.733 --> 00:01:00.433
I didn't expect my junior brother to be so powerful

22
00:01:00.766 --> 00:01:03.100
But I learned all the skills of my senior sister

23
00:01:03.333 --> 00:01:06.433
I haven't seen you in just a few years, and you still have such wealth

24
00:01:06.966 --> 00:01:10.000
Sure enough, only people like my junior brother are worthy of me

25
00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:13.833
Chu Feng, is he that person?

26
00:01:13.866 --> 00:01:16.166
That's what he called me outside today.

27
00:01:16.266 --> 00:01:18.966
Not just for pretending to be my boyfriend

28
00:01:19.466 --> 00:01:22.033
He must have real feelings for me

29
00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.333
What if he were that person?

30
00:01:25.333 --> 00:01:28.300
Oops, I suddenly missed me

31
00:01:29.333 --> 00:01:30.566
Hahaha

32
00:01:31.366 --> 00:01:34.100
Yeah, someone bought my stuff online

33
00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:35.566
I have to go and ship it.

34
00:01:35.566 --> 00:01:39.533
I'll go first, bye, uh, I look the same

35
00:01:39.533 --> 00:01:41.266
I'm going to relax

36
00:01:41.966 --> 00:01:43.400
Uh-huh.

37
00:01:53.566 --> 00:01:54.400
I'll go.

38
00:01:55.666 --> 00:01:56.600
Who?

39
00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.833
Chu Fang, is that you?

40
00:02:03.533 --> 00:02:06.566
Hey, what a coincidence
