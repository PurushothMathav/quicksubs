00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.700
Why are you all here?

2
00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:04.600
Hmm, right.

3
00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:08.100
I'm here to talk to Brother Chu Feng about my dad's condition

4
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:10.900
He asked me about my dad today

5
00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:12.133
But I wasn't available.

6
00:00:12.133 --> 00:00:13.266
I never wrote

7
00:00:13.266 --> 00:00:15.766
I happened to have time this week, so I came over.

8
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.900
Believe it or not, you are out

9
00:00:18.666 --> 00:00:20.900
That's right, that's right, that's really how it works.

10
00:00:21.266 --> 00:00:23.100
What about you tonight?

11
00:00:23.566 --> 00:00:26.000
I want to thank Chu Feng today.

12
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.133
Today at the painting shop

13
00:00:27.133 --> 00:00:29.433
Quickly drive the beautiful Liu Xiong away

14
00:00:30.066 --> 00:00:33.066
I didn't expect Sister Duoying to come here?

15
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.266
Big night

16
00:00:35.866 --> 00:00:39.266
Uh, Shishi, the last time I had surgery in the hospital

17
00:00:40.133 --> 00:00:41.266
Have those opinions

18
00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.100
Although others are unreliable, I am in a bad mood.

19
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.200
So I will come

20
00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:51.600
Boy, hahaha, hey Sisi, what about you?

21
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.200
Why are you here?

22
00:00:54.066 --> 00:00:56.433
Ah, what about Shishi?

23
00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.000
Today is for me to come

24
00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.066
At his banquet the day after tomorrow

25
00:00:59.066 --> 00:01:01.900
Pretending to be his boyfriend to deal with Wang Fan

26
00:01:04.466 --> 00:01:07.500
You should have heard what I just said

27
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.666
Now that everyone is done, why don't we go?

28
00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.600
After all, some people are weak

29
00:01:15.766 --> 00:01:17.466
If you exercise, your legs will be soft.

30
00:01:17.466 --> 00:01:18.900
Have a good rest.

31
00:01:19.466 --> 00:01:21.366
Yes, I still have paintings to prepare.

32
00:01:21.366 --> 00:01:22.166
Yeah, that's right.

33
00:01:22.166 --> 00:01:25.800
The first surgery in the hospital tomorrow, I'm leaving

34
00:01:25.933 --> 00:01:29.100
Then let's get out, let's go, let's go

35
00:01:30.966 --> 00:01:31.766
Walk slowly

36
00:01:44.566 --> 00:01:45.366
Dear

37
00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.100
Why didn't I roll over?

38
00:01:47.133 --> 00:01:48.700
Why didn't I roll over?
