00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:01.633
Ah this

2
00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:03.266
How is that possible?

3
00:00:03.966 --> 00:00:07.100
This seems to be the original work of Mr. Yumo

4
00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:12.366
No matter the style or technique

5
00:00:14.066 --> 00:00:15.300
Hahaha

6
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:18.100
I said, how could this guy possibly be real or fake?

7
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.533
I'll have someone kick him out

8
00:00:21.533 --> 00:00:22.633
Haha wait

9
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.200
I didn't say the painting was fake

10
00:00:25.466 --> 00:00:27.066
Just this seal

11
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.433
It looks like it was just covered.

12
00:00:29.933 --> 00:00:32.033
However, this seal is also genuine

13
00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:34.333
The original work of Mr. Yun Mo

14
00:00:34.333 --> 00:00:35.566
My father had a pair of

15
00:00:35.766 --> 00:00:37.800
I am very familiar with this seal

16
00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:40.066
Excuse me?

17
00:00:40.066 --> 00:00:43.266
I was in a hurry when picking up the flowers just now, and the water spilled on it.

18
00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.366
Then he is genuine.

19
00:00:46.533 --> 00:00:48.066
Then what is mine?

20
00:00:49.333 --> 00:00:52.033
Your brother-in-law may have been cheated

21
00:00:52.266 --> 00:00:55.966
Miss Song doesn't know if you can part with this painting

22
00:00:55.966 --> 00:00:57.433
I give 30 million

23
00:00:57.533 --> 00:00:59.800
Miss Song, I want this painting

24
00:00:59.933 --> 00:01:01.200
I give 40 million

25
00:01:01.266 --> 00:01:02.666
I give 50 million

26
00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.266
How about I dare not give this painting away?

27
00:01:05.266 --> 00:01:08.066
Liu Shao, I said your words were rubbish

28
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.500
Believe it now

29
00:01:09.766 --> 00:01:11.800
Ah, this damn liar

30
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.800
I didn't expect him to lie to my father even?

31
00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.366
If there's nothing wrong tonight, I'll wait

32
00:01:17.366 --> 00:01:18.800
What do you want?

33
00:01:18.866 --> 00:01:21.100
Who said they were hungry just now?

34
00:01:21.333 --> 00:01:24.400
Do you want a piece of food? Do you want me to bring you some water?

35
00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:25.200
you

36
00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.666
Don't go too far.

37
00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.366
Gee, I don't care about it.

38
00:01:29.366 --> 00:01:32.266
It mainly depends on what Miss Qingwan thinks.

39
00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.100
I said I eat

40
00:01:35.266 --> 00:01:36.633
But I didn't say

41
00:01:37.166 --> 00:01:38.200
How much do you eat?

42
00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:39.100
Hey

43
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.766
OK, are you satisfied?

44
00:01:42.266 --> 00:01:43.433
What happened today

45
00:01:44.133 --> 00:01:45.066
Wait for me.

46
00:01:49.366 --> 00:01:52.300
Chu Feng, how did you know this painting was available tonight?

47
00:01:52.533 --> 00:01:55.633
Who are you?
