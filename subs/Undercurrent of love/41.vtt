00:00:00.866 --> 00:00:02.100
This is my latest proposal.

2
00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:03.900
According to my vision, I think

3
00:00:08.166 --> 00:00:09.166
Excuse me?

4
00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:12.000
What are we going to use this place for?

5
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.200
Can you focus?

6
00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.900
In the future, just pay for your own private affairs meetings.

7
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.100
Don't waste everyone's time

8
00:00:27.133 --> 00:00:29.800
Brother Xiaoyu, you finally answered my call

9
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.566
I miss you so much!

10
00:00:31.666 --> 00:00:34.300
Can you come back soon?

11
00:00:34.933 --> 00:00:36.666
That's what you asked in a meeting

12
00:00:37.133 --> 00:00:40.200
Yeah, I'm so bored at home alone.

13
00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:41.600
I miss you so much

14
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:43.500
There are customers at night

15
00:00:44.566 --> 00:00:45.600
Where is the time

16
00:00:45.966 --> 00:00:49.300
Brother Xiaoyu, why don't you ask for a leave?

17
00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.566
Ok I can't ask

18
00:00:51.733 --> 00:00:53.000
Big clients at night

19
00:00:53.266 --> 00:00:54.233
Be good baby

20
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.066
I'll accompany you this weekend, okay?

21
00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.100
Hahaha

22
00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:10.700
Mr. Sun, I will toast you first for this first glass of wine

23
00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.166
I will rely on you a lot for future projects

24
00:01:13.166 --> 00:01:15.233
Hahaha, it's easy to say

25
00:01:15.566 --> 00:01:16.566
I'll do it first

26
00:01:18.933 --> 00:01:20.000
Xiaofang

27
00:01:20.666 --> 00:01:21.466
Hey

28
00:01:22.533 --> 00:01:24.300
Let's have a drink

29
00:01:24.466 --> 00:01:25.866
Mr. Sun, let me come

30
00:01:26.066 --> 00:01:26.933
I toast you this cup

31
00:01:26.933 --> 00:01:27.933
Wish us a happy cooperation.

32
00:01:27.933 --> 00:01:29.566
I did it, you do whatever you want

33
00:01:34.366 --> 00:01:37.500
This guy has a future hahaha

34
00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.966
An Tong, why are you so shameless?

35
00:01:42.933 --> 00:01:44.066
Why are you here?

36
00:01:44.566 --> 00:01:46.000
I talk business normally

37
00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:48.066
How shameless

38
00:01:48.066 --> 00:01:48.866
you

39
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.100
Excuse me?

40
00:01:52.133 --> 00:01:53.700
I'll go out first

41
00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.500
Mr. Sun, I toast you

42
00:02:00.333 --> 00:02:01.133
Come here.

43
00:02:02.666 --> 00:02:05.933
Brother Xiaoyu, why are you with An Peng?

44
00:02:05.933 --> 00:02:08.100
Is it weird that I'm in the same company as him?

45
00:02:08.533 --> 00:02:09.600
How did you know I was here?

46
00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.433
I watched An Tong's Moments

47
00:02:12.133 --> 00:02:13.200
Forget it. Forget it.

48
00:02:13.333 --> 00:02:15.466
You go back first, and I will come back after paying the customer, okay?

49
00:02:15.466 --> 00:02:16.966
Okay? No.

50
00:02:16.966 --> 00:02:18.200
You come with me.

51
00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.200
I'm working.

52
00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.666
Oops ok ok

53
00:02:22.966 --> 00:02:25.566
Then I'll go back and wait for you.

54
00:02:28.166 --> 00:02:30.766
Did I pick the wrong person?
