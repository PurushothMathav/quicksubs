00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.133
You are the leader, right?

2
00:00:02.133 --> 00:00:03.333
I was just looking for you.

3
00:00:03.333 --> 00:00:05.300
What kind of shit tutor are you running?

4
00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:06.800
Totally deceiving consumers

5
00:00:07.533 --> 00:00:09.366
I did it myself, but I don't admit it.

6
00:00:09.466 --> 00:00:11.666
Isn't everyone here to see?

7
00:00:11.666 --> 00:00:12.666
They deceive consumers

8
00:00:12.666 --> 00:00:13.933
How could they do this?

9
00:00:13.933 --> 00:00:15.933
Let's go sit elsewhere

10
00:00:15.933 --> 00:00:18.000
Hey don't go, don't go

11
00:00:18.066 --> 00:00:19.200
Hmm

12
00:00:20.133 --> 00:00:21.633
Hello. Hello.

13
00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.466
This is the hidden model of the exhibition you won.

14
00:00:24.466 --> 00:00:25.800
It is a full set of blind boxes.

15
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:26.866
There is also a shopping card.

16
00:00:26.866 --> 00:00:28.700
You can buy the new blind box for free.

17
00:00:29.466 --> 00:00:31.600
It's better to be like this earlier. Hello everyone

18
00:00:32.133 --> 00:00:33.900
Everybody take a step forward.

19
00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:35.900
Let me introduce you

20
00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.366
The backpack just designed by our company.

21
00:00:39.166 --> 00:00:40.466
It's portable.

22
00:00:41.666 --> 00:00:43.233
You can also span diagonally with one hand.

23
00:00:44.333 --> 00:00:47.433
Yes, you can also carry it when you travel.

24
00:00:47.566 --> 00:00:50.200
You can put some of our mobile iPads.

25
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.600
Then there's an umbrella or something

26
00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.300
I hope you enjoy it.

27
00:00:54.933 --> 00:00:56.400
I want to give me one too

28
00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.433
Get me one. I want one, too.
