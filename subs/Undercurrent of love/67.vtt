1
00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:01.733
So here's the plan.

2
00:00:01.733 --> 00:00:04.066
And our latest newspaper this year.

3
00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.166
This is the general situation.

4
00:00:06.166 --> 00:00:07.466
Let's go this time

5
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.266
It is expected to be used for an investment of 10 million

6
00:00:10.933 --> 00:00:12.966
Yeah, well done.

7
00:00:17.066 --> 00:00:17.900
Thanks.

8
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:23.366
Everyone

9
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:25.800
The document in front of you is this time

10
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.900
The plan for the new product launch of the blind box

11
00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:34.366
I'm planning to do a runway on site.

12
00:00:34.366 --> 00:00:36.800
Let the star wear the clothes in the blind box.

13
00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.200
Run a runway show

14
00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:40.566
Going to have a visual feast

15
00:00:40.933 --> 00:00:42.566
Let everyone really feel

16
00:00:42.566 --> 00:00:44.800
Then expand the promotion of blind boxes

17
00:00:44.866 --> 00:00:46.200
Increase sales

18
00:00:46.933 --> 00:00:48.500
This plan is just a foundation

19
00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.266
Changes will be made later.

20
00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:51.533
I like that idea.

21
00:00:51.533 --> 00:00:54.533
But this publicity fee is probably a lot, right?

22
00:00:54.533 --> 00:00:57.700
Don't worry about the chairperson's investment.

23
00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:01.266
I have pulled the investment of Mr. Yang of Tiansheng Group.

24
00:01:01.366 --> 00:01:03.166
Investment amount 30 million

25
00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:09.366
Not bad, since An Tong is looking for more investment

26
00:01:10.333 --> 00:01:11.600
The plan is also well done

27
00:01:11.866 --> 00:01:13.666
Then I declare

28
00:01:14.733 --> 00:01:18.800
The general person in charge of this conference is An Tong

29
00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:27.666
An Tong

30
00:01:28.333 --> 00:01:30.066
This event is of great significance

31
00:01:30.066 --> 00:01:31.500
You must pay attention

32
00:01:32.066 --> 00:01:34.033
As long as this press conference goes well

33
00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.400
You are sure to get the general manager position

34
00:01:36.733 --> 00:01:37.933
Chairperson, don't worry.

35
00:01:37.933 --> 00:01:39.133
I will definitely complete the task.

36
00:01:39.133 --> 00:01:40.366
Live up to your expectations

37
00:01:40.366 --> 00:01:42.166
Yeah, OK.
