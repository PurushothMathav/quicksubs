1
00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:03.000
My company

2
00:00:04.733 --> 00:00:07.466
The shower is at the end

3
00:00:07.866 --> 00:00:09.833
What did you get?

4
00:00:15.566 --> 00:00:17.233
If there is no desire

5
00:00:19.533 --> 00:00:21.300
If there is no obsession

6
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.966
Then the people I love and the people who love me

7
00:00:27.466 --> 00:00:29.900
Can everyone be happy?

8
00:00:41.266 --> 00:00:42.700
The choice to start

9
00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.100
Decide the current outcome

10
00:00:45.666 --> 00:00:46.833
IF

11
00:00:47.566 --> 00:00:49.233
No one in front of you

12
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.166
Maybe.

13
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.600
Tongtong Tongtong

14
00:00:54.466 --> 00:00:55.966
Student union election tomorrow

15
00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:57.533
A little crowded

16
00:00:57.533 --> 00:00:58.800
A little scared

17
00:00:58.933 --> 00:01:00.666
What are you afraid of in a student election?

18
00:01:00.666 --> 00:01:03.633
You think of the audience below as radish and cabbage

19
00:01:06.533 --> 00:01:09.433
Can you come with me tomorrow?

20
00:01:09.533 --> 00:01:10.766
Of course you can.

21
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.866
I'm calling lotus leaves down there to cheer

22
00:01:13.933 --> 00:01:15.600
Great, come on.

23
00:01:15.733 --> 00:01:17.233
You are so kind.

24
00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.466
I treat you as my best friend, what can I thank you for?

25
00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.000
We will also be good friends for life

26
00:01:23.166 --> 00:01:25.866
We agreed to be best friends for life

27
00:01:25.866 --> 00:01:26.866
It's a deal.

28
00:01:27.266 --> 00:01:29.066
Ha ha.

29
00:01:29.566 --> 00:01:32.400
Hahahaha
