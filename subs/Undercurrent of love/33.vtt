Tongtong

2
00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.500
You are moving

3
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.866
It can be inconvenient to carry suitcases alone

4
00:00:33.666 --> 00:00:36.300
Brother Xiaoyu and I will send it to you later.

5
00:00:36.366 --> 00:00:37.500
I haven't left yet.

6
00:00:37.733 --> 00:00:39.666
You just want to come in, don't you?

7
00:00:41.533 --> 00:00:42.633
What's the wind?

8
00:00:44.766 --> 00:00:46.966
Since you're leaving, it's good to go

9
00:00:46.966 --> 00:00:48.133
Good gathering and good dispersal are good for everyone

10
00:00:48.133 --> 00:00:52.433
Tongtong, we really want to help you, sorry.

11
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.066
Why is that?

12
00:00:58.900 --> 00:00:59.866
Why is that?

13
00:01:01.666 --> 00:01:03.366
Why choose him?

14
00:01:05.066 --> 00:01:08.000
You're not in the mood to ask if I'm bad for you

15
00:01:08.466 --> 00:01:09.300
OK

16
00:01:10.366 --> 00:01:11.566
You have to listen, right?

17
00:01:11.566 --> 00:01:13.166
I have been married to you for so many years

18
00:01:13.166 --> 00:01:15.166
I've been following you, haven't I?

19
00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:16.733
What kind of bow tie do I want to wear?

20
00:01:16.733 --> 00:01:18.966
It's so big that I follow you in what kind of work I do

21
00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:20.800
I listen to you

22
00:01:21.366 --> 00:01:23.300
Every quarrel is my indulgence

23
00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:24.300
Even if you make mistakes

24
00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:26.833
Even if it's not my fault, I'll apologize to you.

25
00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.266
So many years

26
00:01:30.266 --> 00:01:33.066
I've been overwhelmed by your power

27
00:01:34.366 --> 00:01:36.033
I'm tired of living like this

28
00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.166
Every day I'm with you

29
00:01:38.166 --> 00:01:39.100
It just sucks.

30
00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:40.400
I feel bad.

31
00:01:44.733 --> 00:01:46.400
Don't pester me anymore, okay?

32
00:01:46.766 --> 00:01:49.700
Are you having a hard time every day with me?

33
00:01:50.366 --> 00:01:53.500
Yeah, but who told me that?

34
00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.233
I also hope to love me forever.

35
00:01:56.466 --> 00:02:00.400
I ask you, this diamond ring is from you.

36
00:02:02.366 --> 00:02:07.000
Hahaha, I don't want it anymore.

37
00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.900
roll

38
00:02:13.566 --> 00:02:17.700
Ok don't regret it I'll go
