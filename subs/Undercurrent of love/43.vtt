00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.433
chairperson

2
00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:07.300
The recent data performance is not bad

3
00:00:07.533 --> 00:00:09.166
You two competing managers have been

4
00:00:09.166 --> 00:00:10.633
It's been a while.

5
00:00:10.766 --> 00:00:13.433
Recently, the board of directors will thoroughly determine

6
00:00:13.566 --> 00:00:15.800
You two have to behave well

7
00:00:17.066 --> 00:00:18.500
I will perform well

8
00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:21.233
Ah chairperson

9
00:00:21.466 --> 00:00:22.933
I think it's still Minister Fang

10
00:00:22.933 --> 00:00:24.633
Quit this election

11
00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:26.466
I'm afraid he will affect my work.

12
00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.033
What do you mean?

13
00:00:28.133 --> 00:00:29.633
Stop pretending

14
00:00:29.866 --> 00:00:31.200
The whole company knows it

15
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.100
Your marriage to Xiao Xu is in trouble

16
00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:34.200
This woman

17
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.366
It is easiest to be influenced by emotions

18
00:00:36.733 --> 00:00:38.700
I'm really good for you.

19
00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:41.466
Don't worry about Supervisor Wang.

20
00:00:41.466 --> 00:00:42.833
I'll solve it myself

21
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:44.266
Daoist Wang Supervisor

22
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.000
There don't seem to be many talents in your department, do you?

23
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.800
We provide products.

24
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:49.466
nonsense

25
00:00:49.466 --> 00:00:53.266
The project of Dezhou Commercial Bank is supported by our department

26
00:00:54.133 --> 00:00:55.466
You just hit

27
00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.166
I also talked about the customers of Guangzhou Commercial Bank.

28
00:00:58.166 --> 00:01:00.200
Seven seven eight eight for you

29
00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.400
The facts are in front of you

30
00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:04.866
Chairperson, don't listen to his nonsense

31
00:01:04.866 --> 00:01:07.366
I did these two projects on my own.

32
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.100
Okay.

33
00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.600
Stop arguing, both of you.

34
00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:13.866
Previous projects

35
00:01:13.866 --> 00:01:15.400
It was done by your two departments together

36
00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:16.866
Everybody does.

37
00:01:16.933 --> 00:01:19.900
This time I'll separate you.

38
00:01:21.066 --> 00:01:22.266
Who did it well?

39
00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:24.866
Who will do the manager?

40
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.333
Ah wife Xu Deyu

41
00:01:31.333 --> 00:01:32.466
What are you doing here?

42
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:33.800
OK

43
00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.900
Minister Wang, I want to talk to my wife, Lao Wang

44
00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.100
Aren't you both about to get a divorce?

45
00:01:47.266 --> 00:01:48.600
Come, come, come

46
00:01:50.333 --> 00:01:53.566
Xiao Xu, the most important thing for this man is his career

47
00:01:53.666 --> 00:01:55.900
Can you put women's affairs aside for now?

48
00:01:56.066 --> 00:01:57.866
Get the business up first

49
00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:59.833
Think about it.

50
00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.200
If An Tong wins, I'll be the general manager

51
00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.266
Then you will be in front of him in the future

52
00:02:04.266 --> 00:02:06.000
But I can never lift my head
