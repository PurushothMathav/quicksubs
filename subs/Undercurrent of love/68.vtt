00:00:07.133 --> 00:00:08.033
Antou

2
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:10.966
How did you meet Mr. Yang of Tianshe Group?

3
00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:13.500
30 million was invested.

4
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.300
Are you being taken care of by someone else?

5
00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.800
Lin Yue, you'd better keep your mouth clean

6
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.466
Do you think everyone is like you?

7
00:00:20.466 --> 00:00:21.733
Colluded with Xu Zeyu

8
00:00:21.733 --> 00:00:23.166
You cheated my investors

9
00:00:23.166 --> 00:00:24.500
Do you think I can't do anything about you?

10
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.333
But you didn't expect me to still have it.

11
00:00:26.333 --> 00:00:28.700
Aren't you the person in charge of the press conference?

12
00:00:29.133 --> 00:00:31.433
It's not certain whether the event will be done well or not

13
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:32.666
What are you so proud of?

14
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.300
Hum, you can't worry about the event.

15
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.433
I'll take care of it.

16
00:00:37.466 --> 00:00:38.733
When I become general manager

17
00:00:38.733 --> 00:00:41.266
Do you think you will survive in this company?

18
00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.700
I'll treat you well then.

19
00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.766
Let you give full play to the role of your position

20
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:48.500
Humph

21
00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:59.900
An Tong, I won't let you get your wish

22
00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:01.000
Hey Luo Yufeng

23
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.033
Look at this.

24
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.266
Is it better to design it this way?

25
00:01:10.666 --> 00:01:11.466
ANTONG

26
00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.400
You thought you were responsible for the press conference

27
00:01:14.533 --> 00:01:16.366
I'll take it, can't you do anything?
