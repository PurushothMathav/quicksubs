I made breakfast

3
00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:16.666
I didn't do anything out of the ordinary yesterday, did I?

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:17.800
No, no, no, no.

The general manager still needs to be assessed a lot.

13
00:00:42.466 --> 00:00:44.766
This time the company has a new product launch conference for blind boxes.
