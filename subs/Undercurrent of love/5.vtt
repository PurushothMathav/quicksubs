00:00:19.766 --> 00:00:21.000
Haven't brought that yet

2
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.500
I don't like to take that

3
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.100
Come on.

4
00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.300
I'm exhausted from having an engagement ceremony today

5
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.700
Why do you have to come back at night?

6
00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:41.200
Baby, we are both married now.

7
00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.966
Hurry up and get your dad to stamp my promotion

8
00:00:43.966 --> 00:00:45.300
What are you in a hurry?

9
00:00:45.866 --> 00:00:46.666
Afraid that I will run away

10
00:00:46.666 --> 00:00:49.100
Of course my wife is so cute

11
00:00:49.566 --> 00:00:51.966
It's so beautiful, of course I'm afraid you'll run away

12
00:00:52.933 --> 00:00:55.766
Gao Yu, um, you really lied to me.

13
00:00:57.266 --> 00:00:59.166
Didn't you ask me to go home and wait for you?

14
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.433
Why didn't you reply to my message?

15
00:01:01.933 --> 00:01:03.466
Why are you here again?

16
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.600
Didn't you say that you were just acting with this woman?

17
00:01:08.366 --> 00:01:09.500
That one?

18
00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:11.700
Who did you use this with?

19
00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:12.566
Explain clearly

20
00:01:12.566 --> 00:01:14.400
Explain what, are you bothered?

21
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.466
Everything you said this afternoon was a lie

22
00:01:17.533 --> 00:01:19.233
Stop messing around here, okay?

23
00:01:19.366 --> 00:01:21.266
Don't you want money?

24
00:01:23.133 --> 00:01:23.933
Wife

25
00:01:24.533 --> 00:01:25.466
You go up first

26
00:01:25.466 --> 00:01:26.500
I'll go down here.

27
00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.566
Looking so old

28
00:01:28.666 --> 00:01:31.466
I'm embarrassed to rob a man, it's disgusting

29
00:01:33.133 --> 00:01:35.233
I'll leave someone like your husband to you.

30
00:01:35.666 --> 00:01:38.066
I don't want to talk nonsense with him for one more second. Don't worry.

31
00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:45.700
Do you want me to die?

32
00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:47.800
I finally calmed my wife down

33
00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:48.866
You're making trouble again

34
00:01:48.866 --> 00:01:49.966
Wife

35
00:01:50.933 --> 00:01:52.566
Do you really want to marry her?

36
00:01:52.966 --> 00:01:54.233
You lied to me.

37
00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:57.933
Otherwise, I will not marry the chairperson's daughter

38
00:01:57.933 --> 00:01:59.500
Are you marrying a yellow-faced woman?

39
00:02:00.166 --> 00:02:01.666
What can you give me?

40
00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:02.833
Lin Yue

41
00:02:02.933 --> 00:02:05.900
You don't think I'm really going to marry you, do you?

42
00:02:06.666 --> 00:02:07.366
Wake up

43
00:02:07.366 --> 00:02:08.800
Stop dreaming

44
00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:13.066
All these years I have devoted myself to you and taken care of you

45
00:02:14.333 --> 00:02:15.900
Have you forgotten?

46
00:02:17.466 --> 00:02:18.766
I Love You

47
00:02:21.666 --> 00:02:23.666
Are you sick?

48
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.466
How much is that worth?

49
00:02:26.333 --> 00:02:28.766
The money I've spent on you over the years, you serve me

50
00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.100
Shouldn't it?

51
00:02:30.266 --> 00:02:31.633
If it weren't for me

52
00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.066
You don't know which bridge you live under now, do you?

53
00:02:34.166 --> 00:02:35.833
You come and accuse me now

54
00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.866
I suggest you stay away now

55
00:02:38.866 --> 00:02:40.000
Go back obediently

56
00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.766
I'm still willing to help with your dad's affairs

57
00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.000
There's 100,000 dollars in this card

58
00:02:47.366 --> 00:02:48.600
Enough to see your mother

59
00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:51.100
Take the money and get out

60
00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:52.500
Leave me alone.
