Let's raise a glass together tonight

11
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.233
Wish us An Tong, no

12
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.100
General Manager of Real Estate Rongsheng

13
00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:44.300

14
00:00:46.066 --> 00:00:46.866
OK

15
00:00:48.066 --> 00:00:48.866

16
00:00:54.333 --> 00:00:55.433
Congratulations to Mr. Fang

17
00:00:55.733 --> 00:00:57.100
Not only did the beard do well this time

18
00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.366
Also became the general manager

19
00:00:58.733 --> 00:00:59.500
Really impressive

20
00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.300
Thank you all for coming to my promotion party this time

21
00:01:02.666 --> 00:01:04.400
I can be the general manager

22
00:01:04.666 --> 00:01:06.466
Thank you for your support.

23
00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.100
And haha

24
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.100
Yes!

25
00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.666
Our general manager is so capable

26
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.900
One set on the surface and one set behind the back.

27
00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.300
Serious on the surface

28
00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.200
In fact, private life is very chaotic

29
00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.166
Especially when it comes to seducing men

30
00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.066
Very capable

31
00:01:30.333 --> 00:01:31.900
Very accurate.

32
00:01:32.466 --> 00:01:34.166
Even our chairperson

33
00:01:34.166 --> 00:01:37.266
He also fell under Mr. Fang's pomegranate skirt

34
00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.266
Li Yu, what nonsense are you talking about?

35
00:01:43.533 --> 00:01:45.100
Today is my promotion party

36
00:01:46.366 --> 00:01:48.833
Don't talk nonsense in front of your colleagues, okay?

37
00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:50.966
We talk nonsense.

38
00:01:50.966 --> 00:01:52.800
What we say is the truth

39
00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:56.000
An Tong, don't dare to do it

40
00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.333
Do you have any evidence?

41
00:01:57.333 --> 00:01:58.766
Believe it or not I sue you for slander

42
00:01:59.866 --> 00:02:02.000
I knew you wouldn't admit it.

43
00:02:02.266 --> 00:02:03.666
Of course I have proof
