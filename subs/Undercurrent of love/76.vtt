1
00:00:03.366 --> 00:00:04.166
sit

2
00:00:05.333 --> 00:00:07.500
I have one thing to announce at this meeting

3
00:00:07.933 --> 00:00:09.466
Company board resolution

4
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.433
This Antong new product launch event was quite good.

5
00:00:12.733 --> 00:00:15.166
Appointed An Tong as the general manager of the company

6
00:00:20.066 --> 00:00:22.900
In addition, due to Xu Zeyu's work mistakes

7
00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.700
Be expelled

8
00:00:34.733 --> 00:00:37.233
What did the urchin chairperson say about work mistakes?

9
00:00:37.366 --> 00:00:38.500
Is an excuse

10
00:00:38.533 --> 00:00:39.700
Are you being looked for by the nurse?

11
00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:40.866
That's why I lost my job

12
00:00:40.866 --> 00:00:42.300
What nonsense are you talking about?

13
00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.600
I don't understand at all

14
00:00:44.066 --> 00:00:46.400
Stop pretending. You said before that you would become the general manager.

15
00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:47.466
Won't let us go

16
00:00:47.466 --> 00:00:48.766
No, who else could you be?

17
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.666
Maybe you used me to help Lin

18
00:00:51.666 --> 00:00:53.700
The more you cheat the investors' retribution

19
00:00:53.733 --> 00:00:54.533
Xu Zeyu

20
00:00:55.466 --> 00:00:57.033
Don't you have Lin Yue?

21
00:00:57.533 --> 00:01:00.400
How is it not working?

22
00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:01.800
Also lost his job

23
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.300
Don't think I'm gone

24
00:01:03.366 --> 00:01:05.233
You can cover the sky in the company

25
00:01:05.333 --> 00:01:07.466
It's not enough to cover the sky with one hand

26
00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.300
But bullying and bullying your Lin Yue

27
00:01:10.733 --> 00:01:12.033
It's still possible.

28
00:01:12.066 --> 00:01:15.033
I'm sick of seeing you two in and out of the company

29
00:01:15.066 --> 00:01:16.500
How did you become like this?

30
00:01:16.866 --> 00:01:17.900
I still have work to do

31
00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:19.066
Not as idle as you

32
00:01:19.166 --> 00:01:20.266
Too lazy to talk to you
