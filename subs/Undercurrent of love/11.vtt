00:00:11.266 --> 00:00:12.533
I have done as you asked.

2
00:00:12.533 --> 00:00:13.633
What more do you want?

3
00:00:13.933 --> 00:00:15.300
They just came to stay at home for a few days

4
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:16.466
You don't want to

5
00:00:17.333 --> 00:00:19.366
I didn't say I didn't want to

6
00:00:19.366 --> 00:00:21.766
I just feel uncomfortable having outsiders living at home

7
00:00:21.766 --> 00:00:22.566
exist

8
00:00:22.966 --> 00:00:23.900
outsider

9
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.000
In total, your mother can come and live whenever she wants

10
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.833
My mother became an outsider as soon as she came

11
00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:29.566
An Tong, you are too selfish

12
00:00:29.566 --> 00:00:31.066
I usually listen to you in everything

13
00:00:31.066 --> 00:00:33.400
But I'm in charge of this, and I live at home

14
00:00:34.366 --> 00:00:35.800
You talk, talk

15
00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:37.500
Don't talk about my mother

16
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:38.700
I tell you Xu Zeyu

17
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:39.900
I said no, no

18
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.000
Hum An Tong

19
00:00:42.266 --> 00:00:43.766
You're too strong.

20
00:00:44.466 --> 00:00:46.433
I usually follow you in everything

21
00:00:46.666 --> 00:00:48.766
But now you're too much to let my mother live

22
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.600
What do you want me to explain?

23
00:00:50.766 --> 00:00:52.766
How can I look up in front of my family?

24
00:00:53.333 --> 00:00:55.100
You asked me to consider your feelings

25
00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:56.566
You considered my feelings

26
00:00:56.566 --> 00:00:58.100
Did you consider me?

27
00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:59.366
I said no, no

28
00:01:01.666 --> 00:01:04.100
Okay, if you say so

29
00:01:04.266 --> 00:01:05.766
I have nothing to tell you

30
00:01:09.566 --> 00:01:10.500
Xu Zeyu

31
00:01:11.466 --> 00:01:14.000
If you go, you'll never come back
