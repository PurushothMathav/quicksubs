00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.966
Brother Xiaoyu, you are up

2
00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:05.366
Would you like milk or coffee?

3
00:00:05.366 --> 00:00:06.666
I also made sandwiches

4
00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.866
Hmm husband

5
00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:12.900
You see, people have cooked their meals

6
00:00:12.966 --> 00:00:14.266
You're still sleeping there?

7
00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:16.566
Yueyue, you are so kind.

8
00:00:16.566 --> 00:00:19.133
But usually Xu Zeyu and I are not at home

9
00:00:19.133 --> 00:00:21.400
He buys the food and we eat it.

10
00:00:21.966 --> 00:00:23.666
You are usually so busy with work

11
00:00:23.866 --> 00:00:25.466
Definitely don't have time to make breakfast

12
00:00:25.733 --> 00:00:27.466
Fortunately, I don't have to work either.

13
00:00:27.566 --> 00:00:29.500
I will cook for you every day from now on.

14
00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:30.600
Is this please?

15
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.000
Hey, what time is it, husband?

16
00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.800
It's scary to be late for work

17
00:00:42.666 --> 00:00:44.200
Hey, Yueyue, hey

18
00:00:44.466 --> 00:00:46.600
Remember that kitchen trash arrives every day?

19
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.900
There will be little flying insects

20
00:00:49.466 --> 00:00:51.633
I threw a few clothes in the washing machine.

21
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.166
Can you wash it for me?

22
00:00:54.866 --> 00:00:56.100
And the silk dress.

23
00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.333
You must rub my hands for me

24
00:00:58.333 --> 00:00:59.633
I'll rub it for you later.

25
00:01:00.266 --> 00:01:02.000
Hey, hurry up, hurry up, I'm late, okay, okay

26
00:01:03.866 --> 00:01:05.500
Call me every day

27
00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.100
It all belongs to me

28
00:01:36.266 --> 00:01:37.900
It seems good
