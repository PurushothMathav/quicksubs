00:00:00.566 --> 00:00:02.466
This summer fair project

2
00:00:02.566 --> 00:00:04.166
It's a test for both of you

3
00:00:04.533 --> 00:00:06.200
Which one of you always does a good job?

4
00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:07.466
General Manager of Who Province

5
00:00:07.666 --> 00:00:09.900
This time the company will be impartial

6
00:00:10.266 --> 00:00:12.833
Give you the same resources to support

7
00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:15.833
Who can come out on top?

8
00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:17.800
Each according to his ability

9
00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:20.100
urchin

10
00:00:21.966 --> 00:00:24.000
Just wait to be my subordinate

11
00:00:24.333 --> 00:00:27.200
I see how arrogant you are talking to me

12
00:00:27.266 --> 00:00:28.066
Wang Lei

13
00:00:28.733 --> 00:00:30.600
You still can't hold your breath

14
00:00:30.933 --> 00:00:32.600
The fair hasn't started yet.

15
00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.200
You start talking nonsense

16
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.833
Is it too early?

17
00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.966
Fang Buchang, I'm not fighting alone now

18
00:00:38.966 --> 00:00:42.166
You don't mean the new ritual music in your department, do you?

19
00:00:42.733 --> 00:00:44.200
What is he?

20
00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.066
Do you really think he can help you?

21
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.266
Director Fang is always so confident

22
00:00:48.266 --> 00:00:49.366
You need to know

23
00:00:49.366 --> 00:00:50.766
Can bite to death

24
00:00:50.766 --> 00:00:52.866
Often it's something you look down on

25
00:00:53.366 --> 00:00:56.166
Lin Yue, what did you do?

26
00:00:56.266 --> 00:00:58.233
Without any experience, you can still enter Yuesen

27
00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:00.800
I advise you not to laugh too loud

28
00:01:01.166 --> 00:01:03.700
If an inexperienced person like me wins

29
00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:06.166
Wouldn't it be more humiliating

30
00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.200
Sometimes

31
00:01:09.766 --> 00:01:13.000
Winning is not just about work ability
