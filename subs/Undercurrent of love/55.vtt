00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:04.900
Summer Fair project submission plan starts now

2
00:00:05.533 --> 00:00:07.566
Let's go down. Mmm.

3
00:00:23.133 --> 00:00:24.266
This fair

4
00:00:24.266 --> 00:00:26.466
We unfold it in the form of a blind box.

5
00:00:26.733 --> 00:00:29.033
In order to give customers more freshness

6
00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.033
So that was the plan.

7
00:00:49.266 --> 00:00:50.200
Hey, I can't put it down.

8
00:00:50.333 --> 00:00:52.200
How is your group's plan the same as ours?

9
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.300
Same?

10
00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.600
Are you plagiarizing our group's plan?

11
00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.000
Oops for competition

12
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
The general manager actually used such a despicable means

13
00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:03.700
Chairperson, look

14
00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.433
What happened to An Tong?

15
00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.700
Chairperson, I did not plagiarize.

16
00:01:10.366 --> 00:01:11.866
Since the explanation is unclear

17
00:01:12.266 --> 00:01:14.566
Why don't they let their ancestors do sales?

18
00:01:15.166 --> 00:01:16.433
So be it.

19
00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.433
Huang Lei

20
00:01:18.466 --> 00:01:21.633
Your group will sell first, so that the meeting will end

21
00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:38.566
The advertisement clearly says that this blind box has been drawn.

22
00:01:38.566 --> 00:01:40.366
You can give two more blind boxes for free.

23
00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:41.733
Now you don't admit it?

24
00:01:41.733 --> 00:01:42.966
Don't be angry.

25
00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:44.500
How come?

26
00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.900
Manager Wang, I don't know either.

27
00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:48.566
You are the leader, right?
