00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:04.566
An Tong, don't you explain what happened yesterday?

2
00:00:04.566 --> 00:00:05.900
What do I have to explain?

3
00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:07.466
Did you call Gao Yu?

4
00:00:07.666 --> 00:00:09.433
Do you want the whole world to know?

5
00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:11.733
You are a cheating man and you question me

6
00:00:11.733 --> 00:00:13.866
I am treating others in the way of others

7
00:00:13.866 --> 00:00:14.666
ANTONG

8
00:00:15.566 --> 00:00:17.266
How can you let me go?

9
00:00:17.466 --> 00:00:19.666
You should ask Lin Yue this sentence, right?

10
00:00:19.966 --> 00:00:21.600
He won't let me go

11
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.366
Xu Zeyu, think about it

12
00:00:25.666 --> 00:00:27.766
Is Li Yue really what you want?

13
00:00:28.466 --> 00:00:29.800
How is he better than me?

14
00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.500
He doesn't even have a job.

15
00:00:32.133 --> 00:00:33.733
Just your salary

16
00:00:33.733 --> 00:00:36.400
Can you support him?

17
00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:40.466
You think about it.

18
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.900
Who is your best choice?

19
00:00:53.333 --> 00:00:54.200
Brother Xiaoyu

20
00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:01.666
Tired

21
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.800
What's wrong? Are you unhappy?

22
00:01:11.566 --> 00:01:12.500
Jade

23
00:01:13.166 --> 00:01:14.833
I don't think we are

24
00:01:15.866 --> 00:01:17.066
So impulsive

25
00:01:17.266 --> 00:01:19.100
Did An Tong say something to you?

26
00:01:20.466 --> 00:01:23.566
Brother Xiaoyu, I can also go to the company to help you.

27
00:01:23.666 --> 00:01:25.466
Believe me, I'm tired.

28
00:01:25.466 --> 00:01:26.800
I'm going to rest first

29
00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:27.833
Let's talk tomorrow

30
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.266
Ah!

31
00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.800
An Tong, I won't lose this time
