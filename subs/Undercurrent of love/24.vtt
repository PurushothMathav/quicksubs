00:00:05.666 --> 00:00:07.000
You stinky bitch

2
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.166
Do you remember what happened so many years ago?

3
00:00:09.533 --> 00:00:11.733
You eat my food and drink my money

4
00:00:11.733 --> 00:00:14.066
I will put living expenses on your account every month

5
00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:15.800
It's not much.

6
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.833
But the daily expenses are finally enough

7
00:00:18.166 --> 00:00:20.133
And I've been your nanny all these years

8
00:00:20.133 --> 00:00:21.700
Take care of your food, clothing, housing and transportation

9
00:00:22.933 --> 00:00:24.300
Is this all I should do?

10
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.600
I don't owe you anything at all, you bitch

11
00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:27.600
Are you trying to hit me?

12
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.366
You you

13
00:00:30.566 --> 00:00:32.400
So many people are watching

14
00:00:32.566 --> 00:00:34.166
Are you still hitting me?

15
00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.400
You wait for me.

16
00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.900
Hey, don't go, hey, hurry up

17
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.366
Don't leave until you pay me back

18
00:00:48.366 --> 00:00:49.833
Pay back what money

19
00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:51.766
I haven't asked him for money yet

20
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:52.900
I'll tell you what.

21
00:00:52.933 --> 00:00:55.366
Lao Tzu worked hard to earn money to support him

22
00:00:55.366 --> 00:00:58.066
He eats and drinks for free, it's not that I asked Lao Tzu to pay back the money

23
00:00:58.066 --> 00:00:59.000
I'll tell you what.

24
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.500
Even if Tianwang Lao Tzu comes today

25
00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:01.900
I won't pay him back a penny

26
00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.900
You climb high branches and shake off the moon

27
00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:05.433
You still have the face to say that

28
00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.000
You know that the moon supports you to study

29
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.600
You don't know how to be grateful

30
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:09.900
Now you broke up

31
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.600
You must return the money to us.

32
00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.766
Liyue, it was you who ruined my marriage

33
00:01:13.766 --> 00:01:15.133
I haven't asked you for money yet.

34
00:01:15.133 --> 00:01:16.466
I didn't ask you for mental damage.

35
00:01:16.466 --> 00:01:17.466
You ask me for money?

36
00:01:17.466 --> 00:01:19.700
I tell you I'm not doing well today

37
00:01:19.966 --> 00:01:21.433
You can't do it either.

38
00:01:21.533 --> 00:01:23.466
What should I do about Tongtong?

39
00:01:23.466 --> 00:01:25.433
Why don't we go? Don't worry.

40
00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.066
I have to help you with this money today to make you sick

41
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.900
You have to pay back this money today.

42
00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:33.800
You have to pay it back

43
00:01:34.333 --> 00:01:35.133
you

44
00:01:35.966 --> 00:01:36.766
Crazy

45
00:01:43.133 --> 00:01:43.933
Yueyue

46
00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:46.633
Are you all right?
