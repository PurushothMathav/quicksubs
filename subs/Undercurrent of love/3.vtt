00:00:00.533 --> 00:00:01.833
Don't blame me so much

2
00:00:02.266 --> 00:00:04.466
I know you're trying to coax me away by saying that

3
00:00:04.466 --> 00:00:06.366
Right, Li Yue?

4
00:00:06.666 --> 00:00:08.200
You don't even believe me now

5
00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:09.100
I don't care.

6
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.400
If you choose me, you must come with me

7
00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:15.033
Since you have to make such a fuss

8
00:00:15.066 --> 00:00:15.900
Then I'll break up.

9
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:16.933
Pardon me?

10
00:00:16.933 --> 00:00:18.266
I said goodbye.

11
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.600
I'll make it clear to you what else you want to do

12
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.200
Have you ever considered me?

13
00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:24.800
If I go with you

14
00:00:25.133 --> 00:00:26.500
What do these people think of me?

15
00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.300
How can I stay in the company in the future?

16
00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.466
Since you don't think about me so much

17
00:00:31.766 --> 00:00:34.766
Then there is no need for us to continue breaking up, right?

18
00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.833
We can't break up without breaking up

19
00:00:38.366 --> 00:00:39.533
I was wrong.

20
00:00:39.533 --> 00:00:40.900
I'm not thinking of you.

21
00:00:41.966 --> 00:00:43.266
I listen to you.

22
00:00:43.366 --> 00:00:44.833
Apologize to them immediately

23
00:00:44.933 --> 00:00:46.600
I'll go home and wait

24
00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:48.500
Don't break up with me, okay?

25
00:00:48.566 --> 00:00:50.833
Please, honey.

26
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.066
I know you are wronged

27
00:00:53.366 --> 00:00:54.633
But I go this way

28
00:00:54.766 --> 00:00:57.033
It's also for the future of both of us

29
00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:58.566
You go back and wait for me.

30
00:00:58.566 --> 00:01:00.300
Let me explain it to you, okay?

31
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.100
Tell me well.

32
00:01:05.733 --> 00:01:07.600
Wife solved it

33
00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:11.166
Dear guests

34
00:01:11.166 --> 00:01:12.300
Excuse me.

35
00:01:14.366 --> 00:01:16.100
I disturbed Mr. Gao Yu

36
00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:17.700
Why did he apologize?

37
00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.500
Mr. Gao Yu and I have long since broken up

38
00:01:21.766 --> 00:01:23.666
I just need money urgently recently

39
00:01:24.133 --> 00:01:25.833
I just wanted to come and make trouble

40
00:01:26.566 --> 00:01:27.833
breakup fee

41
00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.200
Oh, why is this the little three?

42
00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.266
Sorry.

43
00:01:36.333 --> 00:01:38.866
Honey, I didn't lie to you, did I?

44
00:01:39.066 --> 00:01:39.500
no.

45
00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.700
How could you fall in love with such a three-and-four before?

46
00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.833
Yes yes yes I am blind

47
00:01:44.366 --> 00:01:47.200
How can he, a yellow-faced woman, compare to you?

48
00:01:47.266 --> 00:01:49.166
Don't be angry, ok?

49
00:01:54.466 --> 00:01:55.866
This woman is so shameless

50
00:01:56.366 --> 00:01:58.500
Why is there such a shameless woman?

51
00:01:58.533 --> 00:02:00.166
To see such a thing
