00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:01.600
Come come

2
00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:04.700
Oh, and let me tell you

3
00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:08.100
I heard that our company personnel have grown on time recently.

4
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:08.666
Now.

5
00:00:08.666 --> 00:00:11.166
Our leader Wang Lei and the director of the Xiao Xu family

6
00:00:11.166 --> 00:00:12.500
To be born as a manager

7
00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:13.633
true or false?

8
00:00:13.933 --> 00:00:15.966
That makes Manager Fang

9
00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:17.966
Xiao Xu's little life is getting better and better

10
00:00:17.966 --> 00:00:20.700
Hahahaha oops

11
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.266
Hey, let's not ask Xiaoxue to drink in the future

12
00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.166
How can we not offend our manager?

13
00:00:29.166 --> 00:00:30.000
No.

14
00:00:30.733 --> 00:00:32.666
What if he is the boss?

15
00:00:32.766 --> 00:00:34.833
I'm out to hang out with my colleagues. What's the matter?

16
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:35.900
Hey

17
00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:37.833
First class

18
00:00:37.933 --> 00:00:40.366
That must, must, come and drink, drink

19
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.400
Ouch oops

20
00:00:47.666 --> 00:00:49.900
Isn't this Director Fang of Xiao Xu?

21
00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:50.866
Hey, okay, okay

22
00:00:50.866 --> 00:00:52.600
Don't pretend in front of me, hurry up and pick it up

23
00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.533
Go home early, I won't pick up today

24
00:00:54.533 --> 00:00:56.833
Ouch, hey, hey, hey.

25
00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:00.600
Hey, cheers.

26
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.400
Drinking, drinking, drinking, drinking.

27
00:01:08.066 --> 00:01:10.833
Did something happen to Xu Ze?

28
00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.566
Why don't you answer the phone?

29
00:01:16.133 --> 00:01:18.000
Maybe he's just busy.

30
00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:23.100
I used to call him

31
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.033
He never fails to take it.

32
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.700
Was it because of his group of friends?

33
00:01:28.733 --> 00:01:29.966
I took it for a drink

34
00:01:29.966 --> 00:01:32.966
Oh, then you can ask his colleague.

35
00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.000
I don't have a good relationship with his colleagues

36
00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:41.500
Where is your phone?

37
00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.100
Well you type one

38
00:01:44.133 --> 00:01:45.133
Let me tell you something.

39
00:01:45.133 --> 00:01:46.766
That was definitely not my problem that day

40
00:01:46.766 --> 00:01:47.666
Xu Zeyu

41
00:01:50.266 --> 00:01:52.600
Xu Zeyu, are you brave now?

42
00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:53.400
Not coming home so late

43
00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.100
I called you and you didn't answer
