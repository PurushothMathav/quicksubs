00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:01.433
Should you go?

2
00:00:02.566 --> 00:00:04.633
Tongtong is my fault

3
00:00:04.666 --> 00:00:06.400
I didn't think it through.

4
00:00:06.566 --> 00:00:09.900
Thanks to you and Brother Xiaoyu's care during this time

5
00:00:10.666 --> 00:00:11.966
Don't be angry.

6
00:00:12.566 --> 00:00:13.900
I can go

7
00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.800
An Tong, what are you going to do?

8
00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:20.200
What are you doing with Lingyue about our business?

9
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.966
Don't you forget he just broke up.

10
00:00:22.966 --> 00:00:24.966
Don't go too far, it's alright, Brother Yu

11
00:00:25.733 --> 00:00:27.233
I understand Tongtong

12
00:00:27.533 --> 00:00:28.833
It's all my fault

13
00:00:28.966 --> 00:00:30.500
I talk too much.

14
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.566
Otherwise, you wouldn't have quarreled

15
00:00:33.966 --> 00:00:35.666
I'm going to pack my things now

16
00:00:40.333 --> 00:00:42.500
Lin Yue is gone, have you considered where he lives?

17
00:00:42.566 --> 00:00:44.233
I don't really want to.

18
00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:46.433
It's alright Tongtong

19
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:47.666
I still have some money

20
00:00:47.666 --> 00:00:49.166
I can afford a hotel.

21
00:00:49.666 --> 00:00:52.900
After a while, the matter between me and Gao Yu was resolved.

22
00:00:53.333 --> 00:00:54.966
I'll go out and find a job

23
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.433
Should be able to afford a single room

24
00:01:01.066 --> 00:01:03.166
Actually, I didn't mean to urge you.

25
00:01:03.166 --> 00:01:06.500
Yueyue, I'm sorry, I was too excited just now

26
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.700
But about you and Gao Yu

27
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.366
It's okay to keep procrastinating.

28
00:01:10.466 --> 00:01:11.800
We have to fix it quickly

29
00:01:12.466 --> 00:01:13.266
Right

30
00:01:13.666 --> 00:01:14.666
Let's solve it first

31
00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:16.500
Lin Yue and Gao Yu

32
00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.066
We'll go with him when this is settled

33
00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.466
I also want to solve the matter between me and Gao Yu

34
00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.466
But I get scared when I think about it.

35
00:01:25.533 --> 00:01:26.900
What the hell?

36
00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:28.066
I'll go with you.

37
00:01:28.466 --> 00:01:30.366
I will definitely help you get justice back

38
00:01:32.666 --> 00:01:36.700
Look at this account, he will definitely pay it back.

39
00:01:56.333 --> 00:01:58.800
Say leave me this time

40
00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:00.200
Are you having a bad time?

41
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.300
What's the matter with me in such a hurry?

42
00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.500
Shouldn't you be shameless and want to get back with me?

43
00:02:07.566 --> 00:02:09.800
Stop talking nonsense hahahaha

44
00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.166
We're here today to talk to you about business

45
00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.266
This book is the money you owe Lin Yue

46
00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.300
Don't give me a penny less

47
00:02:20.533 --> 00:02:22.066
I owe him money.

48
00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.100
Ask him yourself.

49
00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.466
I raised him for a day

50
00:02:27.266 --> 00:02:30.466
If you want to pay back the money, this bitch will pay me back.

51
00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.900
Humph

52
00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.666
Did you send those photos?

53
00:02:43.866 --> 00:02:46.833
This is a list of my funding for your master's degree over the years

54
00:02:48.066 --> 00:02:50.200
You pay me back and we are both clear
