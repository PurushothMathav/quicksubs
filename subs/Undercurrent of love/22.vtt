00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.266
Come on, you're not afraid of being seen.

2
00:00:12.666 --> 00:00:14.266
It's okay, still sleeping.

3
00:00:15.066 --> 00:00:16.000
Oh, dear.

4
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:19.633
No, have breakfast

5
00:00:29.066 --> 00:00:30.700
When did you get back?

6
00:00:31.566 --> 00:00:33.966
Talk to me and ask when you came back

7
00:00:34.266 --> 00:00:35.933
This is not your home alone

8
00:00:35.933 --> 00:00:37.766
I can come back whenever I want

9
00:00:37.766 --> 00:00:39.366
Do I need to report to you?

10
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.900
Tongtong, you fell asleep last night

11
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.466
Brother Yu actually called his roommate that night

12
00:00:45.466 --> 00:00:46.000
You see

13
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.933
This is the porridge that Brother Yu made for you when he got up early in the morning

14
00:00:47.933 --> 00:00:49.033
Don't be angry.

15
00:00:52.933 --> 00:00:53.766
How have you been?

16
00:00:53.866 --> 00:00:54.700
Did you get burned?

17
00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:58.100
I'm fine, you'd better hurry up and be red

18
00:00:58.666 --> 00:01:01.566
Li Yue, you can't even control Gao Yu's affairs

19
00:01:01.866 --> 00:01:03.866
You still speak for Xu Zeyu now

20
00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.266
An Tong, are you going too far?

21
00:01:06.266 --> 00:01:08.400
Am I going too far? Are you going too far?

22
00:01:08.566 --> 00:01:10.866
Brother Xiaoyu, stop arguing

23
00:01:11.066 --> 00:01:12.566
Hey, stop listening to him

24
00:01:12.566 --> 00:01:13.633
He is mentally ill

25
00:01:14.666 --> 00:01:15.466
Li Yue

26
00:01:16.066 --> 00:01:17.633
Should you go?
