00:00:02.466 --> 00:00:03.866
All the food you like

2
00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:05.866
Do you remember what I like to eat?

3
00:00:05.866 --> 00:00:07.000
When we first got together in college

4
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.566
We will eat here

5
00:00:09.533 --> 00:00:12.166
They are not together now and still eat here

6
00:00:12.366 --> 00:00:14.066
It's been going around in circles.

7
00:00:14.333 --> 00:00:16.966
Since I want to say goodbye to this relationship

8
00:00:17.266 --> 00:00:19.066
Then I have to take it to heart

9
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.100
This is also for our many years of marriage

10
00:00:22.366 --> 00:00:23.600
Say goodbye.

11
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:44.666
Finish this meal

12
00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:47.466
We don't owe each other

13
00:00:56.333 --> 00:00:57.433
Eat fast

14
00:00:57.566 --> 00:00:59.233
This is your favorite potato chip

15
00:01:14.066 --> 00:01:15.766
urchin urchin

16
00:01:45.366 --> 00:01:46.166
An Tong

17
00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:48.166
We're going home.

18
00:01:48.766 --> 00:01:50.633
You're drunk, let's go

19
00:01:51.133 --> 00:01:52.033
Come on.

20
00:01:52.666 --> 00:01:53.633
Slow down.

21
00:01:54.166 --> 00:01:55.500
Come be careful

22
00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:57.466
Be careful

23
00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.900
Poor care

24
00:02:12.666 --> 00:02:14.766
Mr. Zhang, this glass of wine is for you

25
00:02:14.933 --> 00:02:16.833
The press conference is looking for you.

26
00:02:16.866 --> 00:02:19.800
You're welcome. I've heard about your press conference.

27
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.633
Minister Wang is young and promising

28
00:02:21.733 --> 00:02:24.833
I can rest assured to cooperate with you, haha.

29
00:02:26.733 --> 00:02:27.566
Hey
