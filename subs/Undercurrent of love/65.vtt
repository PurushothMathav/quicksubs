00:00:05.533 --> 00:00:08.166
Xu Zeyu, did you do it on purpose yesterday?

2
00:00:08.166 --> 00:00:10.266
Say something to end our marriage

3
00:00:10.366 --> 00:00:11.800
What's good to get together?

4
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.233
Are you for the investors in it?

5
00:00:14.466 --> 00:00:18.466
I'm so stupid to lie to me with such a thing for you.

6
00:00:18.466 --> 00:00:20.533
Urchin, don't you lie to me too

7
00:00:20.533 --> 00:00:21.866
I'm just doing it the way people do

8
00:00:21.866 --> 00:00:23.466
Just treat him

9
00:00:23.566 --> 00:00:24.800
What kind of means?

10
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.566
Can't beat you

11
00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:30.600
Minister Fang's false accusations are really despicable

12
00:00:35.333 --> 00:00:37.866
We can't compare to you in terms of despicability

13
00:00:37.866 --> 00:00:38.766
Nice

14
00:00:39.133 --> 00:00:41.533
Yesterday, I asked Brother Ono to ask you out

15
00:00:41.533 --> 00:00:44.466
After getting drunk, take away the business card from the colleague

16
00:00:45.366 --> 00:00:47.733
We moved up the appointment for you

17
00:00:47.733 --> 00:00:49.700
I didn't expect you to come so early

18
00:00:49.966 --> 00:00:51.000
But

19
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.266
You're afraid it's for nothing

20
00:00:53.533 --> 00:00:56.466
The investors are totally on our side.

21
00:00:57.133 --> 00:00:57.933
Ah!

22
00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.266
This is the woman you chose

23
00:01:00.766 --> 00:01:02.300
It's a good match.

24
00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.966
An Tong talks about scheming and means, who can be more careful than you?

25
00:01:06.666 --> 00:01:08.833
It's only been a few days since I divorced Brother Xiaoyu.

26
00:01:09.566 --> 00:01:12.766
I immediately found a new love, you An Tong

27
00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.866
You lied to me, and I lied to you.

28
00:01:15.866 --> 00:01:17.000
We're even

29
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.666
Yeah, we've got investors

30
00:01:20.066 --> 00:01:21.766
Wait until Wang Lei gives birth to the general manager

31
00:01:21.766 --> 00:01:23.600
Your days at the company

32
00:01:23.933 --> 00:01:25.466
It's hard

33
00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:29.100
Why don't you look up and see you down in the company?

34
00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.700
I suggest you show some affection to each other

35
00:01:31.966 --> 00:01:34.500
It is better to stay in the company in the future

36
00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:36.766
What do I have to say to you?

37
00:01:36.766 --> 00:01:37.866
Waste of tongue
