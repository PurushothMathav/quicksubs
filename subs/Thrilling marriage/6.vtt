00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:11.400
Especially.

2
00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:19.160
You take people first. I'll get you some water. Don't go.

3
00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:23.390
This is my wind arrow. no,

4
00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:35.520
You listen to me borrow it. Get out of here. I'm in charge,

5
00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.420
Do you all have the habit of deducting money at every turn?

6
00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.270
Give it to me again. The money was deducted.

7
00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.020
Please do whatever you can to please. When I was a kid I cooked,

8
00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.840
It makes it impossible for you to go. Now my idea,

9
00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.780
Jin Mingqiu. I won't go,

10
00:00:54.020 --> 00:01:02.180
I'll do it if you fail me. Have you had breakfast?

11
00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:04.970
I made you a nutritious breakfast. Come and have a taste.

12
00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:20.650
The vice president has already gone to the company. I'm back to help,

13
00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:24.910
Get the documents. This is what you do.

14
00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:28.170
You haven't had breakfast yet. I'll give this to you first.

15
00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.380
Me, I won’t use it now.

16
00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.140
I have to find someone to send the documents

17
00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:36.090
Why is that important?

18
00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.590
I will send the documents for you

19
00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.860
By the way, I’ll make Feiyinyang breakfast for the Vice-Emperor.

20
00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:54.480
The emperor has never tasted something so special.

21
00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.770
You will definitely like the food cooked by the assistant

22
00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:07.420
Not a big CEO

23
00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.000
What are you here for?

24
00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:18.260
Deputy Secretary Lin said you didn’t have breakfast and I’ll get it.

25
00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:25.970
I Lin said you only eat one thing, I am organic

26
00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:29.400
But today for your position

27
00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.260
No appetite to sit down

28
00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:36.870
A good person in personnel matters

29
00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:42.680
disobedient words

30
00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:54.330
My friends can't stand it anymore
