00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:04.370
Unexpectedly, it was for the wrong medical expenses.

2
00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:06.840
I got married so hastily.

3
00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:11.130
And it was with a strange man whom I had only met once.

4
00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:16.580
Take a picture of me. no.

5
00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.680
Come on, the next one is pretty handsome.

6
00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:24.410
I sent it directly to grandma. Don't worry,

7
00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:29.210
I used someone else's camera. Except the marriage certificate was photographed for me.

8
00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:41.250
That, sorry. grandmother,

9
00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:44.760
I will listen to your words and marry Li Jiaojiao.

10
00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.160
Good, good, good. Li Lezhi,

11
00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.420
I can rest assured to recuperate.

12
00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.600
You don't need to come see me, I will be discharged from the hospital soon.

13
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.620
The relationship between husband and wife is cultivated

14
00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.820
You hurry up and help me pack my luggage.

15
00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.879
Moved over to your place

16
00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:12.760
Grandma, go back and pack your things now

17
00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.510
If you move to the middle of the mountain, don’t collect hundreds of trees without moving.

18
00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:18.320
A housekeeper will open the door for you later.

19
00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.410
Explain again

20
00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.600
It’s all just to prevent grandma from getting angry, you understand?

21
00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:32.480
my business card

22
00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.850
Is it my work phone number?

23
00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:40.480
What to do first

24
00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:50.100
The characters around here are pretty good.

25
00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.030
The next World Congress of New Drug Hotels is about to begin

26
00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:01.210
Are you going

27
00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.010
Even if there is only one in ten thousand chance

28
00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:12.100
Who did you marry this me?

29
00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:17.860
Is it the same as the little brother you met when you were a child?
