00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:04.280
Why did he react like this?

2
00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:06.630
It's not like I ruined his gift

3
00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:10.960
This is me outside

4
00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:14.710
where to buy

5
00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:17.530
That might be a gift booth

6
00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:26.290
Sili, copy it for me

7
00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:28.730
Around the mid-level villa

8
00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:30.430
All stalls selling Caipu gifts

9
00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:32.460
Fortunately, I am Jilin

10
00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.300
This waiter is so serious

11
00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.460
What a bastard who wants to take revenge

12
00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:39.900
You start a fight, I want it

13
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.060
Even if you give me all your belongings

14
00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:54.910
Forget it, Taipu wants to stay and fight, I'm sorry

15
00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:57.090
I really didn't break it on purpose.

16
00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.670
How much is this worth to you?

17
00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:03.310
This is a big favor that I specially asked for

18
00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:05.970
Custom-made by Eleven Mile Shabai

19
00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.700
Cash and this brushed steel

20
00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.930
how long are you

21
00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.640
Thought for a moment

22
00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.680
I turned around and cut my mouth again.

23
00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:39.050
Then who told you to talk so scary? I understand.

24
00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:41.660
I want the best in the world

25
00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.300
Then you've been looking for him for so long

26
00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:52.750
If that's the person you're most in charge of

27
00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:07.590
I'll just go into my room again

28
00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:12.780
This misunderstanding room

29
00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:16.990
He sent out bids and quickly found a new recruiter.

30
00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.910
The elevator is not your thing

31
00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:41.280
Is it necessary to go to the sanctions conference?

32
00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.920
The World Materials Conference is ready

33
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:50.730
I will never miss you again
