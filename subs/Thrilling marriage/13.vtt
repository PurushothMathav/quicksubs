00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:03.980
Didn't you eat this dish that night?

2
00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:07.890
What? This is the dish!

3
00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.690
Eat more quickly! Eat more quickly!

4
00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.630
Eat the semi-finished product I made! If you don’t have it cooked yet,

5
00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.270
Eat people quickly! Eat more quickly!

6
00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:18.880
Who! Guess or not? Guess who did it?

7
00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:21.030
How did you become you?

8
00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:23.320
What are you talking about selling?

9
00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:25.580
Don't use your hands to eat me! Just work hard and I will do it,

10
00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:27.700
I won’t do it! I won’t do it!

11
00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:30.150
You have to give me the initiative!

12
00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:31.950
How did it become yours when it was clearly my doing?

13
00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:34.140
Who did it?

14
00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.680
I did it! If you don’t believe it,

15
00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:38.680
Don't use your prosthetic hand! Go call Jingkou!

16
00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:41.020
Don’t you just want to judge those who are superior?

17
00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:42.640
Don’t be afraid that the vice president can divorce you!

18
00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:44.580
Use this method of undermining Sanlan to retain him!

19
00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:47.340
You see, before we were always in our hearts

20
00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.230
As long as I find my heart

21
00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:52.340
Why are you making such a fuss now?

22
00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.410
Am I someone who is making fun of my life?

23
00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.010
Ingredients for this dish

24
00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.130
Vice President, are you okay?

25
00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:08.880
This is not the function I am explaining to you now.

26
00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.690
Of course I cooked this dish

27
00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.000
He didn't make those up

28
00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.270
This is probably a comatose white cat

29
00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:30.580
Vice President Mu Hua

30
00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:32.520
Go ahead and try your best to live your life longer.

31
00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.100
I didn't do this. I won't leave.

32
00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:38.650
I estimated it
