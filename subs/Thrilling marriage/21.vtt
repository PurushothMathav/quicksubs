00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:03.340
This one. You are not welcome here.

2
00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:05.880
You really did own the hotel at that time.

3
00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:08.620
He's just a running dog, and he's still called a kid here.

4
00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:13.430
As far as I know, new and old hotels can be contracted back as long as they have money.

5
00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:16.430
Your emotions are clearly that of the Wei Song Dynasty.

6
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.340
Isn't it just to draw out the madness of the CEO's wife?

7
00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:23.400
That's right, I didn't host any events at all.

8
00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:25.910
I'm just here to tell you his true identity.

9
00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:28.790
Oh my gosh, he wants to be the CEO's wife,

10
00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:30.660
Think about it in general. Mr. Husband,

11
00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:32.910
There is a person named Madam who is attending,

12
00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:35.280
Ask the teacher again. Li Jiajia.

13
00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.940
If it weren’t for your ex-boyfriend Zhao Yi’s career

14
00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.880
I'm afraid that everyone will continue to be sidelined by you

15
00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:43.470
He's just a guy who died late.

16
00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:47.010
Before, I wanted to target the main businesses of my hotels one by one.

17
00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.570
Unexpectedly, I ended up with personal information pass

18
00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:52.930
Xia Ran Shen Yi

19
00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:55.790
Let's spread rumors and slander me again.

20
00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:58.790
You still don't understand clearly

21
00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:00.350
with the gap between us

22
00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:02.810
Don’t think that Israel is superior

23
00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:04.330
To be superior to others

24
00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:07.690
It's just a strict imitator.

25
00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:09.770
Think one's status is noble

26
00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:12.190
Liang Zhi was already picked up in Jiu County

27
00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:16.620
I thought you couldn't get along with us

28
00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:20.480
Do you really think you are the wife of the General Staff?

29
00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.480
How can you take it?

30
00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.640
Kneel down and apologize to us quickly

31
00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.250
Otherwise the vice president is here

32
00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:39.960
Come back soon

33
00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.580
When will it be your turn to take turns?
