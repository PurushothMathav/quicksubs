00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:02.280
See? I have money.

2
00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:04.620
From now on, I will take care of you. Um,

3
00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.060
Well, I am you anyway. It doesn't make sense to me.

4
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.080
have. The thousand-year iron book blooms.

5
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:19.540
This is such a stupid thing to say. yes.

6
00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:28.510
Say something. You care about my feelings about my idea.

7
00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:31.700
Let's settle her matter accordingly. I told me,

8
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:34.740
I worry about you, but you are who you are because of it.

9
00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.380
Last time. From now on, no one will dare not be surprised.

10
00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:41.390
Just get out. You’ve all seen it.

11
00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:44.550
I still say I don’t want the CEO’s wife.

12
00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.490
If you don't want to lose your job

13
00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.350
It's not such a big event

14
00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:54.760
Is it too late to protect the profession?

15
00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.000
I want to estimate the city again

16
00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:00.940
What does it mean to love you

17
00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:02.970
Madam Fu will come right away

18
00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:08.180
Put her in the toilet circle for me

19
00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:10.080
When will the event end?

20
00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:17.100
You are so stupid now that you are clinging to the breeze of wealth

21
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.250
I hooked up with you so much that I sent my supervisor to join forces.

22
00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:22.110
Can you actually make some progress?

23
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.120
You still have to tell the truth
