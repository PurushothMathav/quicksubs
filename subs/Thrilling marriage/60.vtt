00:00:01.940 --> 00:00:06.420
Just be happy. Li Jiajia,

2
00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:09.920
A relative has a house in a school district. Now I have it too.

3
00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.650
I have to let you see my scenery.

4
00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:14.650
Is this a popular Wenjingka place?

5
00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:18.870
First break. Your family has opened a rental house. Why should I do such a fake thing?

6
00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.550
This, but the vice president, in order to make me happy,

7
00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:25.590
This is the best at the low end.

8
00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:28.350
A house costs tens of millions.

9
00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:33.510
This is also the house closest to our company.

10
00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.030
The vice president must be feeling distressed

11
00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:45.460
I decided to open a greenhouse and get up

12
00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.020
You come too

13
00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:57.220
Saving interest is also a good night

14
00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:58.800
He is all alone

15
00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:02.550
This is the best first end

16
00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.520
When I was growing up, I sent the gifts directly.

17
00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.250
I live in Building 7 and it costs 605

18
00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:18.650
The other vice presidents have all bought them for me.

19
00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:22.350
Say you live in Building 7
