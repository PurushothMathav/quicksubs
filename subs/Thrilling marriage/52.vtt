00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:02.460
How dare you talk to me like that.

2
00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:05.160
Do you believe what I say? Let you get out of the Hexian Group.

3
00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:08.240
What are you doing to tell me to get out? You don't claim to be the president or vice president or something.

4
00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:11.090
Then you can tell me. No matter how many phone calls there are.

5
00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:15.570
His personal assistant is here again. A car that was repaired by the public.

6
00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.770
Why do you come down and say you are the deputy president?

7
00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:23.900
That's my word.

8
00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:26.260
It was sent back by the vice president himself.

9
00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:29.500
I think what Lin Jiaojiao said makes sense.

10
00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.440
We did not see the vice president.

11
00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:35.940
Send a letter. How about you call the vice president in front of everyone?

12
00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:38.500
I left the plane from here

13
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.120
How could I do it because of this little thing?

14
00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:43.780
Didnâ€™t I just say that I was the president?

15
00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:46.860
Then why don't you dare to make a phone call now?

16
00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:49.670
Your relationship with the vice president is so settled

17
00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:58.780
What confidence do you have in thinking he will help you?

18
00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.280
What do I want? The vice president has no feelings

19
00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:05.360
Why is his watch on me?
