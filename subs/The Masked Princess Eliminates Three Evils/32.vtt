1
00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:01.800
Who doesn't know the whole Sea City now?

2
00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:02.866
What did you say about cheating?

3
00:00:02.866 --> 00:00:05.466
If I don't divorce, where will my Ye family's face go?

4
00:00:06.166 --> 00:00:08.166
The Ye family is a splurge

5
00:00:08.166 --> 00:00:09.433
Fart face

6
00:00:09.466 --> 00:00:12.633
He really thought he was the richest man in Haicheng

7
00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:13.666
These years

8
00:00:13.766 --> 00:00:16.766
If they hadn't given you the wealth of the big criminal

9
00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.866
You're broke so early

10
00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:21.300
Lin Zhuang's net worth

11
00:00:22.666 --> 00:00:24.200
It is the net worth of the Xiao family

12
00:00:24.733 --> 00:00:26.866
How did Lin Shuang take the Xiao family as his own?

13
00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:29.766
Godmother, you know better than anyone

14
00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:31.200
Lin Shuang

15
00:00:31.866 --> 00:00:33.633
Can't you stop being mean?

16
00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.300
Isn't divorce just right?

17
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.100
Brother Chen

18
00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.633
I was wronged why don't you believe me

19
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.966
I will not divorce you

20
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.000
He will give you a death ticket

21
00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.066
How dare you threaten me?

22
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:47.700
Shut up

23
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:49.633
childish

24
00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:51.600
What is marriage?

25
00:00:51.966 --> 00:00:53.366
Benefit to bundle

26
00:00:54.666 --> 00:00:57.700
What if you two get divorced and start arguing?

27
00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.600
Both are just confused for a while

28
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.833
If you feel unbalanced

29
00:01:03.466 --> 00:01:06.966
You can also get rid of the confused old lady Ma Su

30
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.466
Your Su family's set doesn't work with me

31
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.000
I will definitely be divorced from this marriage

32
00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:13.433
And frost

33
00:01:14.566 --> 00:01:16.100
You have to get out.

34
00:01:16.466 --> 00:01:17.266
Humph

35
00:01:17.966 --> 00:01:19.700
Clear out

36
00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:20.900
Ye Chan

37
00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.066
You are afraid of being beaten by others, and you are too flashy, right?

38
00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.433
I really thought I had lived so many years in vain

39
00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.033
This bastard is eavesdropping at the door
