00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.333
Did you hear?

2
00:00:01.333 --> 00:00:03.400
Mr. Sha, the richest man in Beijing

3
00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:04.900
Come to our Haicheng

4
00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:06.666
I heard that I came to find my sister on purpose

5
00:00:06.666 --> 00:00:09.100
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I heard that too.

6
00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:11.400
His sister has a new type of birthmark

7
00:00:15.066 --> 00:00:16.533
This little girl named Sarin

8
00:00:16.533 --> 00:00:18.266
Died after an accident a month ago

9
00:00:18.266 --> 00:00:19.400
From today onwards

10
00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:20.433
You are him

11
00:00:20.766 --> 00:00:21.966
Just in case.

12
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:23.133
My confidence in him

13
00:00:23.133 --> 00:00:24.800
The birthmark is also bad for you.

14
00:00:25.866 --> 00:00:27.366
Do they have any relatives?

15
00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.100
The police are not investigating.

16
00:00:31.066 --> 00:00:32.300
He was an orphan.

17
00:00:32.466 --> 00:00:33.566
Exiled to Haicheng

18
00:00:33.866 --> 00:00:35.633
I only know that I am a spiritual person

19
00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.366
But he mentioned to me before

20
00:00:38.466 --> 00:00:39.500
He will keep

21
00:00:40.966 --> 00:00:44.866
Could it be that your identity today is the sister of Shaxi Club?

22
00:00:45.266 --> 00:00:46.900
Heart-shaped birthmark

23
00:00:48.266 --> 00:00:49.666
Is this right

24
00:00:49.666 --> 00:00:52.566
Just like your servant

25
00:00:52.566 --> 00:00:55.200
It can't be the sister on the beach, can it?

26
00:00:57.566 --> 00:00:58.500
Mountains

27
00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:02.866
You said you wouldn't be the consolation daughter of the wine capital, right?

28
00:01:03.666 --> 00:01:05.000
Madam joked

29
00:01:05.133 --> 00:01:06.700
Country people like me

30
00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.566
I dare not dream of a relationship with Pan, a wealthy family in Beijing

31
00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:12.966
Before I finish giving

32
00:01:12.966 --> 00:01:14.566
Never like to get started

33
00:01:14.766 --> 00:01:15.700
Thank you, Ma'am.

34
00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.900
Your cheongsam is so pretty.

35
00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:19.333
Must be expensive

36
00:01:19.333 --> 00:01:20.833
That's for sure.

37
00:01:20.966 --> 00:01:22.400
What is the identity of Mrs. Ye?

38
00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.533
The things he uses are naturally the best

39
00:01:24.533 --> 00:01:26.000
This flag?

40
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.100
But back then, my adoptive mother let the international top lead

41
00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.866
It was designed for me.

42
00:01:30.866 --> 00:01:32.333
I plan to wear it tomorrow.

43
00:01:32.333 --> 00:01:34.100
On my wedding anniversary

44
00:01:34.533 --> 00:01:37.866
Yingying was stolen from your mother
