00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:10.800
What do you mean?

2
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.400
Put on my collar

3
00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:14.466
You are mine

4
00:00:14.866 --> 00:00:16.400
Do you consider me your pet?

5
00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:17.400
No, I don't want it.

6
00:00:29.933 --> 00:00:31.433
It's useless for you to hide

7
00:00:32.133 --> 00:00:33.366
Wearing a necklace

8
00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.166
You are my man

9
00:00:37.133 --> 00:00:39.100
Goodbye little wildcat

10
00:00:41.166 --> 00:00:42.466
It's crazy.

11
00:00:42.466 --> 00:00:44.400
An inexplicable dream really came out to find

12
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:45.200
This time

13
00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:49.600
To hell with it.

14
00:00:54.266 --> 00:00:55.800
It was a dream

15
00:00:55.866 --> 00:00:57.200
That's unfortunate.

16
00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.266
Nice sight of that guy

17
00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.833
Is that guy okay?

18
00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:16.800
That guy?

19
00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:19.200
Could it be that counterfeit sterilization was discovered?

20
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.633
Was it silenced?

21
00:01:27.333 --> 00:01:28.566
Sorry Lin Bei

22
00:01:29.066 --> 00:01:30.566
If there is an afterlife

23
00:01:30.566 --> 00:01:32.100
I would love to be my sister

24
00:01:34.866 --> 00:01:36.600
Hello 110?

25
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.600
Dai Zong, your 3,000 yuan worth of wipes

26
00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.866
Can only keep you and your wife for 4 8 hours

27
00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.266
If both cannot be proven innocent within 48 hours

28
00:01:49.266 --> 00:01:52.200
Then the police will catch up again and

29
00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:54.600
Refuse any form of retention

30
00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.000
Oh, I see.

31
00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.500
What are you still doing?

32
00:02:03.933 --> 00:02:05.733
Hurry up and call Li Fei

33
00:02:05.733 --> 00:02:07.300
Ask him how things are going.

34
00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.500
What Xiaobei is in the hospital?

35
00:02:14.766 --> 00:02:15.600
What do you mean?

36
00:02:16.466 --> 00:02:17.466
So what's going on?

37
00:02:17.466 --> 00:02:19.900
Your Beijing hospital seems to have sterilized rice noodles

38
00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.166
I don't know exactly.

39
00:02:21.166 --> 00:02:24.033
Ask me again, I've asked for so many things

40
00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:26.233
In my dream today, you told me that something was wrong

41
00:02:26.533 --> 00:02:29.066
Spit it out. Spit it out.

42
00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:34.300
Ok, come back to me.

43
00:02:36.533 --> 00:02:37.600
All right.

44
00:02:42.466 --> 00:02:45.466
Hahahahaha
