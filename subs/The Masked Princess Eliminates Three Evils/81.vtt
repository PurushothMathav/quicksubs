1
00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.566
I am you and I lost my sister Lin

2
00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:05.300
You return my sister Lin

3
00:00:07.133 --> 00:00:10.300
Chen Wei, are you crazy?

4
00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:11.533
It's all the murderer

5
00:00:11.533 --> 00:00:13.566
What's wrong with my boy's boyfriend?

6
00:00:14.133 --> 00:00:16.566
Why do you still think of him?

7
00:00:18.266 --> 00:00:20.900
The son has been around for more than 20 years

8
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.866
You go through the death of motherhood one day.

9
00:00:24.266 --> 00:00:26.266
You've been using me

10
00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.633
You make me force myself to live according to your wishes

11
00:00:30.066 --> 00:00:32.466
What's the difference between you and the walking dead?

12
00:00:33.333 --> 00:00:35.266
You know I'm with them

13
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.700
I feel like I'm alive alone.

14
00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.966
You give me back my change.

15
00:00:47.133 --> 00:00:50.166
I'll send you to the city, you bastard, to hell

16
00:00:50.166 --> 00:00:50.966
Ah!

17
00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:53.500
Ah!

18
00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.300
Zhang Wei

19
00:00:55.966 --> 00:00:57.400
You don't know

20
00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:59.233
He promised.

21
00:00:59.933 --> 00:01:01.566
I want to promise you

22
00:01:11.566 --> 00:01:13.966
Miss Sha is really Mr. Ye's lucky star

23
00:01:13.966 --> 00:01:15.566
Just got together with Mr. Ye

24
00:01:15.566 --> 00:01:17.966
The Yip Group and the Xiao Group merged

25
00:01:17.966 --> 00:01:20.066
Now in the whole sea city

26
00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.000
Mr. Ye's Xiao Group is really leading the way

27
00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:26.900
This idea was first proposed by Dawn

28
00:01:27.133 --> 00:01:30.266
He said whether the Shaw Group annexed the night market

29
00:01:30.366 --> 00:01:32.000
Or the night market annexed Xiao's

30
00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.966
As long as the final beneficiary is me

31
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.466
Don't worry about those details

32
00:01:35.466 --> 00:01:36.766
Is Miss Sha right?

33
00:01:36.766 --> 00:01:38.300
This pattern is atmospheric.

34
00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:39.700
I can't call Miss Sha anymore

35
00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:41.100
It should be Mrs. Ye

36
00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:42.900
Reinvigorate the Xiao Group

37
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.266
The Yip Group is the best stepping stone

38
00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:47.900
Ye Chan

39
00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.600
I haven't divorced you yet.

40
00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.966
I can't wait to share my anger with the little three
