1
00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:01.033
bastard

2
00:00:01.333 --> 00:00:04.266
I'd like to see who you really are

3
00:00:05.566 --> 00:00:08.700
It's broken, can't this guy be unable to act?

4
00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:11.266
I'm not here today to serve you, but to serve

5
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:14.633
I want to send good news to Mrs. Ye

6
00:00:20.333 --> 00:00:21.133
This

7
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.500
It was Mrs. Su who paid for the book

8
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.300
It clearly states that he

9
00:00:29.766 --> 00:00:33.200
Illegal division of shares with your husband and wife

10
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.600
Property and patent licensing

11
00:00:41.966 --> 00:00:45.066
Impossible how dare that old woman say it

12
00:00:45.566 --> 00:00:46.433
old woman

13
00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.900
Madam, Mrs. Su is your godmother.

14
00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:52.200
Even if he committed a crime

15
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.700
You can't say that about him, can you?

16
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.433
And didn't you just say it?

17
00:00:56.533 --> 00:00:59.200
In this way, Mrs. Su can take the initiative to stand up

18
00:00:59.466 --> 00:01:01.566
Recognize Mrs. Ye

19
00:01:01.666 --> 00:01:02.733
Did you speak?

20
00:01:02.733 --> 00:01:04.000
Please answer directly in the middle of the period.

21
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.466
When you married Mr. Ye

22
00:01:05.466 --> 00:01:07.200
Claimed to have brought a migration dowry

23
00:01:07.266 --> 00:01:08.666
Are those migratory dowries

24
00:01:08.666 --> 00:01:11.033
Did you invade the Xiao Group to get it?

25
00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.300
No, it's impossible.

26
00:01:13.333 --> 00:01:14.266
The dowry is mine

27
00:01:14.266 --> 00:01:17.900
It's my Mr. Ye, do you have anything to say?

28
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.566
I'm sorry I'm not complete with what happened today.

29
00:01:22.766 --> 00:01:24.666
And refused to answer any questions

30
00:01:25.366 --> 00:01:27.400
As for Ling Shuang's personal behavior before marriage

31
00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.433
It has nothing to do with performance

32
00:01:33.966 --> 00:01:34.866
Excuse me.

33
00:01:34.866 --> 00:01:35.933
Adults have misunderstood

34
00:01:35.933 --> 00:01:39.166
It's a misunderstanding, Mr. Shan
