00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.200
What if a pet is out of control?

2
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:23.966
Just put it next to you and look at him

3
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.033
Just in case he comes out and attracts people

4
00:00:32.533 --> 00:00:33.800
Red has something to do

5
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.066
I'll go first

6
00:00:35.066 --> 00:00:37.100
Husband husband

7
00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.333
Remember to get off work early?

8
00:00:39.333 --> 00:00:42.066
Let's celebrate the new life of our marriage together

9
00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.100
husband

10
00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:45.666
You are all mine

11
00:00:48.866 --> 00:00:49.666
Come here.

12
00:00:56.566 --> 00:00:58.166
I already told you

13
00:00:58.266 --> 00:01:00.200
I've never been married to a pig

14
00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.366
But life

15
00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:04.766
I was wrong.

16
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.233
The pheasant still wants to deceive Phoenix

17
00:01:09.466 --> 00:01:11.166
I told you so.

18
00:01:11.166 --> 00:01:14.066
What else can you get from me but this face?

19
00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.066
Not to come with me

20
00:01:22.066 --> 00:01:24.233
Your cards have been charged

21
00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.066
You can't stay

22
00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.666
After all, your home has the widest territory

23
00:01:41.933 --> 00:01:44.033
That's right, who is my bottom line?
