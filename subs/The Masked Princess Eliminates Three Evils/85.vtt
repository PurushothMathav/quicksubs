00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.266
Think about it again, who is it because of?

2
00:00:08.266 --> 00:00:09.266
Are you talking about killing me?

3
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:12.566
But it's impossible.

4
00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.066
He is just a little girlfriend

5
00:00:14.066 --> 00:00:15.600
How can you have such great ability?

6
00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:16.900
and

7
00:00:17.933 --> 00:00:18.966
Why did he want to hurt me?

8
00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.266
I investigated him before

9
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.200
He's not just had plastic surgery.

10
00:00:23.466 --> 00:00:26.066
Also embezzled the investment within Sha Zong

11
00:00:26.266 --> 00:00:28.866
It must be hard to get into an industrialist

12
00:00:29.866 --> 00:00:31.200
As for the reason

13
00:00:31.266 --> 00:00:32.800
I don't know yet.

14
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.433
What do you do now?

15
00:00:37.133 --> 00:00:37.966
husband

16
00:00:38.266 --> 00:00:41.666
So are you going to make up with me now?

17
00:00:42.733 --> 00:00:45.833
Of course, a hundred couples a day

18
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.900
Wife is waiting for the moment we wake up

19
00:00:49.733 --> 00:00:51.400
We start over

20
00:00:52.933 --> 00:00:56.233
Husband, I knew you couldn't bear to part with me

21
00:00:56.333 --> 00:00:59.766
Then I'll ask Xiaobei to find Mr. Sha

22
00:00:59.966 --> 00:01:02.666
Expose the true face of that bastard

23
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:03.666
Exactly.

24
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:06.000
Buddha's face like killing Jun Ze

25
00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.366
I will definitely put that soul egg

26
00:01:09.066 --> 00:01:11.600
Died without a burial

27
00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.066
President, I bought what you want.

28
00:01:21.333 --> 00:01:23.300
Top South African Diamond Necklace

29
00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:27.100
That's so great!

30
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.766
Great as a collar

31
00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:31.200
president

32
00:01:32.133 --> 00:01:34.300
You want to put this necklace of hundreds of millions of dollars.

33
00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.000
As a collar for pets?

34
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.500
For my little feral cat

35
00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:38.966
Is there a problem?

36
00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:39.900
Oh.

37
00:01:40.166 --> 00:01:41.000
fantasy

38
00:01:41.733 --> 00:01:42.900
That's fine.

39
00:01:45.266 --> 00:01:47.766
The president

40
00:01:48.333 --> 00:01:51.166
Maybe you go first with the blood bar

41
00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:52.600
I'll fix it.

42
00:01:52.766 --> 00:01:55.466
It's you two coming with me

43
00:02:07.533 --> 00:02:08.633
To hell with it.
