00:00:01.333 --> 00:00:03.166
The president has investigated it clearly.

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.166
Miss

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.266
Died in a car accident

4
00:00:09.766 --> 00:00:10.966
Exactly the same day

5
00:00:10.966 --> 00:00:13.700
The little lady had cosmetic surgery in the same hospital

6
00:00:13.766 --> 00:00:16.766
Since then, he has been pretending to be the eldest lady

7
00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:22.633
What caused those car accidents?

8
00:00:23.466 --> 00:00:25.266
The driver of the accident, of course

9
00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:26.466
But after the incident

10
00:00:26.466 --> 00:00:29.166
The driver's account has 1 million

11
00:00:29.666 --> 00:00:31.000
Will officially call someone

12
00:00:31.666 --> 00:00:33.700
Call the police

13
00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.166
Do you suspect

14
00:00:38.366 --> 00:00:41.100
Dare to teach me to do things

15
00:00:41.466 --> 00:00:44.366
If you dare to say a word, you will end up

16
00:00:57.666 --> 00:01:00.700
Would you like to thank our townspeople for subscribing?

17
00:01:01.766 --> 00:01:04.700
If you want to continue playing

18
00:01:05.766 --> 00:01:09.233
I'll make you feel like I'm immortal

19
00:01:09.933 --> 00:01:11.166
Of course you do.

20
00:01:13.333 --> 00:01:14.966
Why did you kill my sister?

21
00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.066
What a sacrifice

22
00:01:18.266 --> 00:01:19.066
kill

23
00:01:19.966 --> 00:01:21.466
The only daughter of the Xiao family

24
00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.066
Parents are dead or the goddess is missing

25
00:01:24.366 --> 00:01:27.000
When it reappeared, it suffered a

26
00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.500
Also used the identity of I love you

27
00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:34.266
I admit that I am not an identity in the network

28
00:01:34.366 --> 00:01:36.000
But I didn't get him killed.

29
00:01:36.266 --> 00:01:37.766
I died in an accident after the fact

30
00:01:37.766 --> 00:01:41.466
Surprisingly, you really don't cry when you see the coffin?

31
00:01:41.466 --> 00:01:43.200
Do you really think the driver is dead?

32
00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.666
I can't find it.

33
00:01:45.866 --> 00:01:50.066
After the incident, you mixed 1 million into his account

34
00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.566
1 million was me

35
00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:53.500
Come

36
00:01:54.066 --> 00:01:57.200
Drag this bastard who killed my granddaughter to the water jail

37
00:01:57.366 --> 00:01:59.566
I'm going to slowly torture him to death
