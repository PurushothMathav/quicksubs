00:00:00.866 --> 00:00:02.200
Killed out so soon

2
00:00:02.766 --> 00:00:06.500
I thought my face was perfect

3
00:00:06.566 --> 00:00:07.466
Ha ha.

4
00:00:08.566 --> 00:00:10.100
Ginger is still old and spicy

5
00:00:10.566 --> 00:00:12.300
Right?

6
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.433
Like you said

7
00:00:14.766 --> 00:00:17.500
You wouldn't talk to me in a place like this

8
00:00:19.866 --> 00:00:23.166
Master, that little bastard dares to fight me

9
00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.033
On the surface, the shares of Xiao's Group were given to me

10
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.633
To actually put the blame on my head

11
00:00:33.866 --> 00:00:37.033
Mother, your identity suddenly entered our Su family

12
00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.000
I just want to be sensible

13
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.233
Why does Mr. Su work part-time?

14
00:00:43.933 --> 00:00:45.600
You want me to help you?

15
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.300
You have to mention something like Dongliu

16
00:00:48.166 --> 00:00:49.033
Humph

17
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.900
Your Shaw Group is long gone

18
00:00:53.966 --> 00:00:58.033
Do you think you have the qualifications to negotiate terms with me?

19
00:00:58.533 --> 00:00:59.966
In that case

20
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.433
To kill to kill

21
00:01:01.933 --> 00:01:03.166
Whatever you want.

22
00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.266
You think I dare not

23
00:01:16.266 --> 00:01:17.766
You want my life?

24
00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:19.300
Then I'll give it to you.

25
00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:20.866
But

26
00:01:21.333 --> 00:01:25.166
I'm afraid you want to go down with me too

27
00:01:32.333 --> 00:01:36.700
No wonder the little bastard who was able to take Lingshuang before

28
00:01:37.066 --> 00:01:38.700
Playing around

29
00:01:39.066 --> 00:01:40.633
Still have some skills

30
00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:44.800
If you want revenge on Lingshuang, I can help you.

31
00:01:45.066 --> 00:01:46.633
But only if

32
00:01:46.866 --> 00:01:49.700
You must first clear my name

33
00:01:51.066 --> 00:01:54.233
You mean you think I'm fat all my life?

34
00:01:54.366 --> 00:01:57.800
Yes, as long as you stand up and tell the truth

35
00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.800
Xiao's Group returns to its original owner

36
00:02:00.966 --> 00:02:03.166
There's no fake drugs involved.

37
00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.200
And at best it's just a failure of the experiment

38
00:02:06.366 --> 00:02:11.600
And then you give me 40% of Shaw's shares

39
00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.700
What do you think?
