00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.700
This old fox's abacus is really good

2
00:00:02.933 --> 00:00:05.500
However, the current situation cannot be resisted

3
00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:09.800
Okay, so you should let me go now

4
00:00:10.133 --> 00:00:12.566
Of course you want to put it

5
00:00:12.866 --> 00:00:15.700
But you little bitch

6
00:00:15.766 --> 00:00:17.633
It's not some upstairs light.

7
00:00:17.766 --> 00:00:19.233
I also need to watch out for you.

8
00:00:19.533 --> 00:00:21.866
I can't let the tiger go back to the mountain

9
00:00:25.566 --> 00:00:26.566
What do you want?

10
00:00:26.566 --> 00:00:29.966
Don't be nervous, this is good stuff

11
00:00:30.133 --> 00:00:33.266
Promise you'll listen to me in the future

12
00:00:33.766 --> 00:00:36.400
Are you sure you'll be put in jail?

13
00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:38.033
hands-on

14
00:00:55.366 --> 00:00:56.400
Ah slightly total

15
00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.700
Why are you back?

16
00:01:00.866 --> 00:01:01.700
Little Wildcat

17
00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:03.700
Wake up

18
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:05.966
It's you again

19
00:01:06.566 --> 00:01:07.766
worry about gains and losses

20
00:01:07.933 --> 00:01:09.266
Found by you

21
00:01:09.866 --> 00:01:11.600
I look embarrassed

22
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.666
Or was it discovered by you?

23
00:01:14.366 --> 00:01:17.433
I like to see you any way you look

24
00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:22.100
Little Wildcat

25
00:01:24.966 --> 00:01:25.766
Mr. Sha

26
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.300
I didn't know it was your woman

27
00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:28.533
I want to know it's your daughter

28
00:01:28.533 --> 00:01:30.266
Give me a hundred guts, I wouldn't dare

29
00:01:30.266 --> 00:01:32.566
2 Mr. Sha, please give me a way to live

30
00:01:32.566 --> 00:01:34.466
I didn't say I wanted you to die.

31
00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:36.200
Thanks last time

32
00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.000
Thanks last time

33
00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:38.500
Compared to death

34
00:01:39.066 --> 00:01:41.066
I prefer to let others know

35
00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.500
What do you mean life is better than death?

36
00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:44.600
Mr. Chen

37
00:01:45.133 --> 00:01:50.633
Follow me ah ah ah ah
