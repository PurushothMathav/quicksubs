00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.866
You heard the conversation I had with that woman just now.

2
00:00:06.866 --> 00:00:07.666
Right?

3
00:00:08.166 --> 00:00:10.566
Are you pushing me very hard now?

4
00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:12.666
You're always born with nothing.

5
00:00:12.666 --> 00:00:13.966
Even his own mother

6
00:00:13.966 --> 00:00:16.700
Yeah, unavoidable trash

7
00:00:18.933 --> 00:00:21.000
No one can choose their origin

8
00:00:21.366 --> 00:00:23.400
But you can control your own future

9
00:00:24.466 --> 00:00:26.400
Don't hurt yourself anymore

10
00:00:26.566 --> 00:00:30.233
Let me know if you are unhappy, okay?

11
00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.033
You are the first to say this to me

12
00:00:37.066 --> 00:00:38.966
Lin Bei, sorry.

13
00:00:38.966 --> 00:00:40.433
You are not wrong.

14
00:00:40.666 --> 00:00:41.800
But where you come from

15
00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.200
The blood on your body

16
00:00:43.566 --> 00:00:45.300
We are destined to be enemies

17
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.233
possible

18
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.766
I am also the last one

19
00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:52.066
What do you mean?

20
00:00:52.333 --> 00:00:55.166
You want to leave me not I want to leave you

21
00:00:55.666 --> 00:00:58.066
She's your sister.

22
00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.300
He doesn't like me in this house

23
00:01:01.366 --> 00:01:02.166
No.

24
00:01:03.333 --> 00:01:04.566
I don't want you to go

25
00:01:04.766 --> 00:01:06.566
I love you to stay by my side forever

26
00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.100
I don't want to leave you either.

27
00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:11.566
Want me to stay

28
00:01:12.166 --> 00:01:13.466
There's only one way.

29
00:01:13.466 --> 00:01:14.333
How?

30
00:01:14.333 --> 00:01:17.166
You said just say it lightly and I'll listen to it all

31
00:01:23.766 --> 00:01:25.233
I need a new branch

32
00:01:25.733 --> 00:01:27.266
Reappear on the phone
