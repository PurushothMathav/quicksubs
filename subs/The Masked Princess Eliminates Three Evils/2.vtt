00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:03.766
10 years ago, I was the one who put frost like a stray dog

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.466
Brought back the whole house

3
00:00:05.733 --> 00:00:09.400
In a few days, this will be your home

4
00:00:09.766 --> 00:00:11.633
Come to your mother

5
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:13.766
Baby

6
00:00:13.766 --> 00:00:16.600
From now on, this is your home, you know?

7
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:18.266
So nice

8
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.233
I didn't expect

9
00:00:20.733 --> 00:00:22.166
Brought it home

10
00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:23.700
It's a wolf.

11
00:00:23.866 --> 00:00:25.666
He first climbed my dad's tree

12
00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:28.700
It's your adopted daughter, how do you come down and take over?

13
00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:30.233
I said it was an accident.

14
00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.900
Surprise you little bitch

15
00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:34.866
I shouldn't have played tricks on you

16
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:38.233
You shut up

17
00:00:42.733 --> 00:00:45.766
Then in order to completely take the Xiao family as his own

18
00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.300
He killed my parents

19
00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.333
Don't think I don't know

20
00:00:52.333 --> 00:00:54.500
What are you country folk thinking?

21
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.566
Relying on their own beauty

22
00:00:56.566 --> 00:00:58.433
Just think carefully about this activity.

23
00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:59.266
Killing order is distracted

24
00:00:59.266 --> 00:01:01.233
Humble to get this job

25
00:01:01.266 --> 00:01:02.666
All by the kindness of the lady

26
00:01:02.666 --> 00:01:03.766
Even if you kill me

27
00:01:03.766 --> 00:01:04.366
Then I dare not move

28
00:01:04.366 --> 00:01:05.366
Really thoughtful

29
00:01:05.466 --> 00:01:08.433
If you dare to move, I will kill you

30
00:01:10.866 --> 00:01:12.633
My husband will be back soon.

31
00:01:12.733 --> 00:01:15.366
Remember to give me every corner of the room

32
00:01:15.366 --> 00:01:17.266
All cleaned up

33
00:01:17.266 --> 00:01:19.500
If I find a little dust

34
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.166
I'll skin you

35
00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:27.866
Who doesn't know that Mr. Ye is not an eyesore?

36
00:01:27.933 --> 00:01:30.400
He's just relying on a few stinky money he has

37
00:01:30.466 --> 00:01:33.100
Cheeky business age with Mr. Ye

38
00:01:33.566 --> 00:01:37.000
Don't you like to rob other people's men for the rest of your life?

39
00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.100
Then my revenge will begin with your husband

40
00:01:48.366 --> 00:01:49.200
husband

41
00:01:50.333 --> 00:01:51.166
I have

42
00:01:52.866 --> 00:01:54.200
Waiting for you.

43
00:01:56.166 --> 00:01:57.366
I still have work

44
00:01:57.366 --> 00:01:58.600
You go to sleep first

45
00:02:06.333 --> 00:02:07.766
Mr. Hao Ming

46
00:02:08.466 --> 00:02:10.300
You're never coming back.

47
00:02:16.266 --> 00:02:20.166
Night Lake Sea City's largest family will be penetrated

48
00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.900
The people in the population are like gentlemen

49
00:02:22.933 --> 00:02:25.433
Are you really a gentleman?
