00:00:02.466 --> 00:00:03.400
Who?

2
00:00:05.333 --> 00:00:06.766
Linlin, what are you praising?

3
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:07.700
Linlin

4
00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:10.600
I know I was wrong about the last date

5
00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:12.766
But I was also coaxed by the bastard next door

6
00:00:12.766 --> 00:00:16.433
Dangerous In fact, I only have you in my heart

7
00:00:17.533 --> 00:00:18.500
Please leave now

8
00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:20.266
Otherwise, I will call the police immediately.

9
00:00:21.733 --> 00:00:23.033
No Lingling

10
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.000
Don't call the police.

11
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.633
It took me 30 million to keep it up

12
00:00:26.266 --> 00:00:27.400
I wanted to meet you.

13
00:00:28.166 --> 00:00:30.166
You have always been smart.

14
00:00:30.166 --> 00:00:32.866
You should know that as long as you make one

15
00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:34.900
You will eventually have yourself

16
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.500
Sooner or later

17
00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:37.300
Lili

18
00:00:37.733 --> 00:00:40.166
I love you I really love you

19
00:00:40.166 --> 00:00:41.566
The things I do

20
00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.433
In fact, I also want to help you live a better life

21
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:46.700
Really?

22
00:00:47.166 --> 00:00:50.266
Then you went to the name in order to revive history

23
00:00:51.133 --> 00:00:53.233
Later, with Mrs. Su I

24
00:00:53.466 --> 00:00:56.866
It was you who divided Xiao's property

25
00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:00.666
Even so

26
00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.300
That doesn't affect the relationship between us

27
00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:05.833
You steal barbecue

28
00:01:06.166 --> 00:01:08.166
I swallowed my parents' breath

29
00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.166
Yingzi is the murderer who forced them to death

30
00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:13.633
Do you think it has any effect?

31
00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.000
You are the girl of the Xiao family

32
00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:18.400
To me

33
00:01:18.733 --> 00:01:20.566
It's Xiao Ai

34
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.633
How could this be?

35
00:01:27.866 --> 00:01:29.966
How could this be?

36
00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:40.700
pass

37
00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:42.900
Love you so much

38
00:01:43.166 --> 00:01:45.166
Why did you go to that bastard Sarin?

39
00:01:45.166 --> 00:01:46.166
Why is that?
