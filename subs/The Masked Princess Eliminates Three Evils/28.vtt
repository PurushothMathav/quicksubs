00:00:11.866 --> 00:00:14.566
You you let me go

2
00:00:14.566 --> 00:00:15.800
Do you know who I am?

3
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.000
Let go of me

4
00:00:20.866 --> 00:00:21.866
let go

5
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.366
The spirit man is amazing

6
00:00:26.366 --> 00:00:28.333
Come up and hit people without saying a word

7
00:00:28.333 --> 00:00:29.866
You deserve it if you can't find your sister

8
00:00:33.766 --> 00:00:35.000
What's going on?

9
00:00:35.133 --> 00:00:37.300
How did this woman get beaten like a pig's head?

10
00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.000
Dad finally opened his eyes

11
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.366
So gloating

12
00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.533
How much revenge to seduce my father

13
00:00:45.533 --> 00:00:46.600
Hurt my friends

14
00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:47.766
Do you think this is enough?

15
00:00:48.933 --> 00:00:51.233
You really are a performer

16
00:00:52.566 --> 00:00:54.266
Why do you run backstage when you see me?

17
00:00:54.266 --> 00:00:55.466
I am also your savior

18
00:00:55.466 --> 00:00:56.766
Don't be blind

19
00:00:57.133 --> 00:00:58.533
You're a shitty reference

20
00:00:58.533 --> 00:00:59.966
This regret is what I hired

21
00:01:00.166 --> 00:01:01.566
Do you understand self-directed and self-performed?

22
00:01:05.566 --> 00:01:06.366
that

23
00:01:07.133 --> 00:01:08.100
Where do you intend to go?

24
00:01:08.266 --> 00:01:09.400
Are you my father?

25
00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:10.866
It's none of your business where I go

26
00:01:12.166 --> 00:01:15.966
Are you going to find the man who opened the house?

27
00:01:16.733 --> 00:01:18.466
Sir, I don't know you.

28
00:01:18.866 --> 00:01:20.466
Are you a little too wide?

29
00:01:21.666 --> 00:01:23.633
You treat me as a mistake

30
00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:24.966
Mind your own business

31
00:01:31.866 --> 00:01:33.166
contentment

32
00:01:37.133 --> 00:01:39.766
The top floor is the presidential suite where I live

33
00:01:40.466 --> 00:01:42.466
Come and give me a try tonight.
