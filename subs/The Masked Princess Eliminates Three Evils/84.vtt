00:00:02.566 --> 00:00:04.000
After the game is over

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.566
I will return this face to his master

3
00:00:13.666 --> 00:00:14.900
What are you doing here?

4
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.833
I thought I would find a place to kiss you

5
00:00:17.866 --> 00:00:19.400
Kiss your head

6
00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:20.500
Are you a dog?

7
00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:21.700
It's going backwards every time.

8
00:00:21.933 --> 00:00:23.666
Interesting. I'm a dog.

9
00:00:24.133 --> 00:00:26.566
Because dogs like to chase

10
00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.000
time

11
00:00:31.933 --> 00:00:32.833
Why is it so hot?

12
00:00:36.766 --> 00:00:38.600
It's so cold to stay at the beach

13
00:00:38.733 --> 00:00:40.400
If you don't know, I thought you were a female ghost

14
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.033
Go take you back

15
00:00:42.766 --> 00:00:43.900
You really have seen

16
00:00:44.566 --> 00:00:46.900
What are you doing?

17
00:00:52.733 --> 00:00:54.500
Little feral cats are really hard to find

18
00:01:05.866 --> 00:01:08.666
I won't let anyone steal my rhythm

19
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.333
I am innocent.

20
00:01:14.333 --> 00:01:15.300
Let me out!

21
00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:16.466
I want to rob a lawyer

22
00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:21.000
Husband, what are you in a hurry?

23
00:01:21.266 --> 00:01:23.766
Lawyers will come when they arrive

24
00:01:24.866 --> 00:01:25.966
You've got it all figured out.

25
00:01:25.966 --> 00:01:27.400
I will kill you

26
00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.600
Fine. Strangle it now.

27
00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.900
Then wait for the boat to take the old iron

28
00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.000
And a favorite

29
00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.266
Husband, what are you in a hurry?

30
00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.366
You think about why things take you
