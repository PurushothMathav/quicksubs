00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:10.010
Your Majesty, what His Highness said is false.

2
00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:12.690
There are factors that separate this water

3
00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.430
This kind of skill and great ability can clean up any mistakes.

4
00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:16.250
turn deadly

5
00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.710
A fake knife shop is so angry that it's really bad

6
00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:23.090
Come on, let's pull that fake knife out and chase it away.

7
00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:25.750
The tiger is disturbing your life. The emperor is disturbing your life.

8
00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:28.850
All of this, all of this is from the Three Emperors Mansion, it was just me who did it

9
00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:30.780
Are you talking nonsense? Am I you?

10
00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:33.580
Third Prince, it was obviously you who did it like me

11
00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.980
If you want to hit someone, you can't say anything back.

12
00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:37.540
Die a worthy death and move up

13
00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:38.880
Just come to Liu Zhi

14
00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:42.190
Yes, this is where the fire comes from, hey, third brother

15
00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:44.050
Just now at the Dafa conference

16
00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:44.830
This falsehood is

17
00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:45.910
It’s about me and Jiang Ni

18
00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:47.130
You could say this is the way

19
00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:49.130
Naturally, it’s best to go with everyone.

20
00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:50.230
Then why just

21
00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:51.530
Be strict when you see me

22
00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:52.210
Is it early?

23
00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:52.870
Look at you today

24
00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:55.050
How come I was used as Jiang Ni’s number?

25
00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.810
Are you able to figure it out?

26
00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:57.950
Or you had already

27
00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:59.470
Is it okay to live in this false way?

28
00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:01.120
If you don't deserve it, I won't say anything

29
00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:02.620
Enough of this

30
00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.060
It doesn't matter if you are dozens of times more powerful than immortals.

31
00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:10.210
Do you really think it doesn't exist? It suits me
