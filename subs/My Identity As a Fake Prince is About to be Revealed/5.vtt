00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.080
Don't say, don't say,

2
00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:05.240
Don't say, don't say, the master is Sanhuangsu,

3
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.600
Put on the eyes in the kilometer, emotions,

4
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:09.920
Don't say, don't say, don't say,

5
00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:12.380
The owner is Sanhuangsu, put on the eyes and emotions of Kilometers, don’t say,

6
00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:14.340
Don't say, don't say, don't say, don't say,

7
00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.040
Don't say, don't say, don't say, don't say,

8
00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:28.200
Don't say, don't say, don't say, don't say, don't say,

9
00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:31.630
Don't say, don't say, don't say,

10
00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:33.290
Don't say, don't say, don't say, don't say, don't say, don't say, don't say, don't say, don't say, don't say, don't say, don't say, don't say, don't say,

11
00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:34.890
Don't say, don't say, don't say, don't say,

12
00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:38.400
How could it be Dahuangze? Bright Girl

13
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.740
Come and see you if that's enough

14
00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:41.960
Everyone listens

15
00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:43.100
You should play away from home

16
00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.700
I don’t know if this public comment is very meaningful, but

17
00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:55.200
You found another one

18
00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.080
Hurry up and don’t have any

19
00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:02.430
It's scary to go to Huang Gong.

20
00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:05.480
Who has the strength to be a bright woman?

21
00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:07.820
Are you from Sanhuangze?

22
00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:09.270
Not this year

23
00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.010
It’s also Sanhuangze

24
00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:11.210
I really know this day

25
00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:12.090
The majestic Huang Gong

26
00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.250
Hold the door so no one can leave

27
00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:14.710
Go ahead and leave that dog alone

28
00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:15.670
Maybe he thinks

29
00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:17.350
The people who live in this Huang Palace Maid are not human beings.

30
00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:18.770
But alone and male and female

31
00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:19.370
Just say a group

32
00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:20.990
Her mother and daughter travel to the city

33
00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:22.530
Smoke does not belong to

34
00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.290
I'll take you away and you won't belong immediately

35
00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:26.090
The one she helped the father-in-law was brought by an ungentleman.

36
00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:27.070
A few scolds

37
00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:28.810
Come on, three kings and four kings

38
00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:29.730
Can't follow or win?

39
00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:32.470
you and for you

40
00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:33.610
I scolded you and said

41
00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:34.830
His Highness

42
00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:36.210
Keep one as His Majesty's property

43
00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.710
Even at five thousand fifty

44
00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.650
I'm not a woman, I belong to metal

45
00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:42.870
The person behind you is not a good person, okay?

46
00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:44.070
A word from His Highness

47
00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.050
impress me

48
00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:46.690
Think you don't belong to you

49
00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:47.950
Not for a long time

50
00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:49.010
I don’t want to be a retail investor at all

51
00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.370
Don't want retail investors

52
00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:50.030
Don't want retail investors

53
00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.280
Don't want retail investors

54
00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:51.460
Don't want retail investors

55
00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:51.580
Don't want retail investors

56
00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.880
Don't want retail investors

57
00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:52.100
Don't want retail investors

58
00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.200
Don't want retail investors

59
00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.320
Don't want retail investors

60
00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:52.440
Don't want retail investors

61
00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:54.240
Don't want retail investors

62
00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.380
Don't want retail investors

63
00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.740
Don't want retail investors

64
00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:55.680
Don't want retail investors

65
00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:56.100
Don't want retail investors

66
00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.680
Don't want retail investors

67
00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:58.020
Don't want retail investors
