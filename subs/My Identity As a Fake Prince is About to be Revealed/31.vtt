00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.400
Since the French Prince copied other people’s figures,

2
00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:05.660
Think about it seriously,

3
00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:07.640
Blame stops the world,

4
00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:15.850
Just worry, worry, worry, worry, worry, worry, worry, worry, worry, worry, worry, worry, worry.

5
00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:17.790
Worry, worry, worry, worry, worry, worry, worry, worry, worry, worry, worry, worry, worry, worry, worry, worry, worry, worry.

6
00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.070
Worry, worry, worry, worry, worry, worry, worry, worry, worry, worry, worry, worry, worry, worry, worry, worry, worry, worry, worry, worry, worry, don’t say

7
00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.490
Truly a complete astronomy

8
00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:39.540
How is it possible that we can’t do it if we have the goods?

9
00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.880
What happened back then was not just nonsense

10
00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:45.520
Is it difficult to eat the quality of your mind?

11
00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:48.000
Do we think we are fools?

12
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.020
I just took a break

13
00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:51.120
This half injection box

14
00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:52.840
Haven’t talked about it yet

15
00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:57.970
Unlucky but unlucky, misfortune spreads

16
00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:00.790
Just now with old Li Guoanfeng

17
00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:02.360
Lao Dang's crowd

18
00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:04.650
Destiny's heart

19
00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.150
Please room in front

20
00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:08.700
Don’t chase the quality of destiny

21
00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:10.810
It's the same as running from a silver prison

22
00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:12.390
Destiny with a free heart

23
00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:15.510
Once upon a time, there was no talk of a thousand clouds.

24
00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:17.350
More than before

25
00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:19.130
Respect for working hard to become stronger

26
00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.970
It's the eternal scroll, it's too complex

27
00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:29.150
I remembered it, I remembered it

28
00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:31.830
Siwen does have pallets

29
00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.760
It’s just my teacher’s early coding.

30
00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.240
Only money and goods were left to me

31
00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:42.310
When the goods are shipped, the pallets cannot be moved by the goods.
