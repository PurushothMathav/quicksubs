00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.170
Hua Chang, can he do this?

2
00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:07.110
Whether he can do it or not, it’s up to you.

3
00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:10.040
The professional media went to Sanjing in September.

4
00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:13.000
Talk about water, but talk about gold,

5
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.700
It's been a long time, but Mu Shanzi.

6
00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:18.660
I became the mayor of the old city, but adults can't.

7
00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:21.510
Yu Xiaoyuchen, the people in this district,

8
00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:23.450
Even if the mountain falls, he will take care of it,

9
00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:26.290
And the autumn water, the sky is the same color for a long time.

10
00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.100
and presided over the planning

11
00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:42.340
This Dahuang has always been known to me from the opposite side.

12
00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:45.560
How could someone be so familiar with each other?

13
00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:46.600
Monsanto South Vietnam

14
00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.600
Who was the Corrupted Giant?

15
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.340
King Monsanto explained

16
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.080
A good person with bad looks

17
00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.220
Between the dead furniture

18
00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.260
From now on the mountain will be priceless

19
00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:05.680
I've misunderstood Dahuangzi

20
00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:07.640
Mr. Wang will not be hanged on the mainland

21
00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:17.210
The advantage of knowing everything at once

22
00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.540
Guanshan Nanyue

23
00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:24.490
A full cup of deer-eaters

24
00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:26.860
A unique tool that melts to death through the ages

25
00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:28.680
I have blood all my life

26
00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:33.900
There is no old Chinese saying that can compare with it.

27
00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.860
Too much people think this match is

28
00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:39.150
It’s the eldest prince who wins. It doesn’t matter.

29
00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.310
Because of the lyrics

30
00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:42.980
It’s not the words written by the eldest prince

31
00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:46.740
It turned out to be one day

32
00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.240
Super excited to do it
