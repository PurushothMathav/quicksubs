00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.800
good. segment at

2
00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.059
End of each line What Lai Jia Xu has done, I am sorting it out

3
00:00:04.059 --> 00:00:07.280
Jia Xu made a mistake and just discovered this side of the president.

4
00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.100
I collect people out of love,

5
00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:12.980
Unexpectedly, he said to Dahuang himself,

6
00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.460
Rhubarb said from his own body,

7
00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:18.460
You said it, Allen thought of the title of the play,

8
00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.060
This is just one,

9
00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.220
I see,

10
00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:24.960
Such a tragic plan,

11
00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.520
Throw yourself into my royal face,

12
00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:29.980
But, do you have something to say? It's too urgent,

13
00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:31.980
Is it feasible for us to do that?

14
00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.020
Don’t you believe this?

15
00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.770
Then why don't you tell me to hire a big prince?

16
00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.300
So hired

17
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.660
how to make people believe

18
00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:42.320
This is definitely a family seat

19
00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:45.520
It comes from your hand. Stop watching.

20
00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:48.100
This was the housework line back then

21
00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:49.920
Does it count as average care?

22
00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:51.640
Why else would it be just these two sentences?

23
00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:53.500
You are super allowed to send people's works with the name of the medicine

24
00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:54.780
Xi Jingshangshang

25
00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.600
What's the crime?

26
00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.740
In fact, there is no need to use this non-capitalist approach

27
00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:01.480
I can’t finish watching you

28
00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:03.820
The front of this play

29
00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:08.240
Listen to the weapons, but later it didn’t seem like you were hiding something.

30
00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.640
If you have ever experienced the ups and downs in your life,

31
00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.550
It is really possible for a prince to write such an opinion

32
00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:19.130
When you were young, you were well-off and sheltered, but you had nothing to lose

33
00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:20.690
between sadness

34
00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:23.880
Wang Er, you may still have something to say.

35
00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.090
Father, the eldest prince copied other people’s works

36
00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.050
After all, my royal words

37
00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:31.790
A man rises from his father's position and separates his prince's military committee

38
00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:34.130
Also call it the name of a place of residence
