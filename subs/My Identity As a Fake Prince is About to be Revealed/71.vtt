00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:10.750
Why do you start with me and you again?

2
00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:28.950
Come again. I'll wait and see and want to do it again this time.

3
00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.320
Before the prince was killed by a first-level wind,

4
00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:45.800
From now on, I will just wait to go inside the Great Prince.

5
00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:47.720
Just do your best and don't say anything.

6
00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:58.400
Of course, after all, we are on the same line.

7
00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.280
I heard that the prince made an earth mine today.

8
00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.060
After getting rid of the bottom of the pot, it is really amazing.

9
00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:08.560
It turns out that the fight should have been over.

10
00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:11.730
Since then, we are on the same line.

11
00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:21.230
I'm just curious about the same legend.

12
00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:23.210
Everyone has heard of this pronunciation
