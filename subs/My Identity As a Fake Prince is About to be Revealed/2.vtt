00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.580
If I remember correctly, the woman in front of me was a princess from the previous dynasty.

2
00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:06.840
How many yuan did the royal family pay for your suicide? You misunderstood

3
00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:08.700
I'm not a great prince

4
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.240
You are not the eldest prince, so what are you holding in your hand?

5
00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:13.120
Even if you are accustomed to dressing

6
00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:15.840
I can’t hide the fact that you are the eldest prince.

7
00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.740
What if I said I just saw you on the ground?

8
00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:20.490
Yongqian slipped

9
00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:23.080
If you die, what is your reading?

10
00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:24.460
Any other meaning?

11
00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:27.970
What do you care about?

12
00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:29.910
Yes, I am the eldest prince

13
00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.190
how can you kill me

14
00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:35.190
I still have a secret experience that I want to kill. Make sure I have a secret.

15
00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:36.640
what secret

16
00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.140
Don't play tricks on me

17
00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:40.000
Sister, you are pressing against my throat.

18
00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:42.200
How dare I play tricks? Secret

19
00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:45.160
In my waist you kill my sister

20
00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:46.760
Sister, don’t be so sinister.

21
00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:49.150
It would be nice if you really have a Dun on my waist

22
00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:50.430
Suddenly, right?

23
00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:51.850
I want to see what you took out

24
00:00:58.300 --> 00:00:58.580
Look, is it a surprise?

25
00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:59.930
Didn't I lie to you?

26
00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:01.140
The secret is inside

27
00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.720
Just don't let him go

28
00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:05.480
What a surprise

29
00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:07.600
don't know how to go

30
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.280
Whatever you want, I like it

31
00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:25.300
How about finding information that you feel comfortable with?

32
00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.880
Is this secret very personal?

33
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.300
Is it sour and refreshing?

34
00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:35.100
Why don't you just memorize it?

35
00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:35.680
I told you

36
00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:36.940
Too much ego is not a great prince

37
00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:40.810
If you have your own preference, don’t move.

38
00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.050
If you are doing it

39
00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:44.350
I can't guarantee my hand

40
00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:46.210
I won't mess with you. Dare you?

41
00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:47.660
Then look at me

42
00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:48.840
Don't you dare to do it? Don't you dare to do it?

43
00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:51.510
You are the only one who speaks so beautifully

44
00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:52.820
There are so many of him

45
00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:57.050
Because I want everyone to be a fool

46
00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.460
Can you survive until now?

47
00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:01.260
No, you are stupid.

48
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.200
Do you dare to understand me

49
00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.300
Now the eldest prince is dead

50
00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:07.740
I have to do some drinking.

51
00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:12.920
Went to something big
