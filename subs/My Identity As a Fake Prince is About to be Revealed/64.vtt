00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.820
Lao Tzu, please take it out and show it to me.

2
00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:05.440
I'm here, right?

3
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.810
Father, it’s still too early to write about things.

4
00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:11.710
I think you are just making it up and hiding it,

5
00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:13.470
That is my 100,000 party decision.

6
00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:16.710
After all, what is the so-called treatment, it is like leaving the team.

7
00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:18.690
This is what people say,

8
00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:21.530
It’s really a mouth, but it’s a mouth of a star.

9
00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:23.110
The bright moon turns him into your spirit,

10
00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:25.930
If you, a soil type like you, don’t do a good job,

11
00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:27.430
Everyone's mouth is ordinary,

12
00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:29.410
I am so naive that I am already too strong

13
00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:32.220
Go and pay back a few credits.

14
00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:34.700
Order to eat at the meeting place, that's right over there

15
00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.350
Waiting for the Guo Guoshi group to arrive tomorrow

16
00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.010
I will teach experiments

17
00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:40.750
Wait for Guo Da to give it to him

18
00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:41.970
true or false

19
00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:43.570
Please ask your father for help

20
00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:44.730
with all ministers

21
00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.250
Watch well

22
00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:48.200
I want to see

23
00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:50.250
What exactly can be taken out?

24
00:00:50.250 --> 00:01:03.220
What is the origin of that thing you are talking about?

25
00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:05.160
Does this thing have a cat?

26
00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.090
This can only be called a living belly

27
00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:08.600
But he can be very useful

28
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.260
Not only can he make clay

29
00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:11.500
You can also make Lianton

30
00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.550
This is Liandun

31
00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:17.060
Even if I tell you, you don’t understand

32
00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:18.800
Let's just talk about this place

33
00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.520
Don't look at him. He is only such a big man.

34
00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.020
But his rules

35
00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.100
enough to put this

36
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.600
Auxiliary wind power will blow it back

37
00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:30.040
You must not watch the novel

38
00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:31.200
All the right things have been posted

39
00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:32.610
The auxiliary wind power plant exploded

40
00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.810
If you can't do it by then

41
00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:37.080
Let me see what you call it

42
00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:39.540
Then let's call the field a list of names.
