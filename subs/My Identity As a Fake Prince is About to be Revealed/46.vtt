00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:03.400
The eldest prince was once a fraud,

2
00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:05.540
The real one had been killed long ago,

3
00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.400
Sure he hits the pads, why not wear him,

4
00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:10.320
If encountered, if the knot is worn on the mat,

5
00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:14.160
Over there, there are no words to show off the people in the world who killed the eldest prince.

6
00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:17.470
Ah, when I met him going out,

7
00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:19.320
It's dark now,

8
00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.470
Since he dares to pretend to be the eldest prince,

9
00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.300
Then I will put him on my bed to seek life and death.

10
00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:29.900
Can't die,

11
00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.030
Ah, ah, ah,

12
00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:33.830
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah,

13
00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:36.050
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah,

14
00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:37.610
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah,

15
00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:41.620
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah,

16
00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:43.320
Third brother is so angry

17
00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:54.100
What are you doing? Nuannang is angry.

18
00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:55.180
My brother is coming today

19
00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:56.540
There is a way

20
00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:58.520
I see your gravity is equal to your job

21
00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:00.680
Let our big brother

22
00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.580
Yes Countertest

23
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.180
I will listen to it

24
00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:13.760
What about this yellow hatred?

25
00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.220
Said from the best

26
00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:16.920
But no two words

27
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.580
This is quite difficult

28
00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:20.420
I will go to each other and beg for mercy

29
00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:21.600
Guaranteed after two terms

30
00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:28.640
You will show up in the end for the sake of good, I am so divided

31
00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.240
Please lie to me

32
00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:34.190
You can't live but you can't die.

33
00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:36.940
I'll draw the line

34
00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:43.550
It seems that this tuition fee

35
00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:45.830
We donâ€™t have a good relationship with this big classmate of ours.
