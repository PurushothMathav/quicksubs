00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:03.140
What? You two,

2
00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:11.200
Come here and tell me whether it is real or fake! This, this

3
00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:19.140
Not quite alive, not quite alive with love

4
00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:20.360
Lock them all up

5
00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:28.040
This can't be that

6
00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:34.820
Will the dye enter your balance recipe?

7
00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:43.010
It won't leave any injuries, right? Third brother

8
00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:45.650
But you still forgot

9
00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:47.630
It’s not that you treat me like someone else. You can’t deceive me.

10
00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:52.400
You are a driver

11
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:53.640
daddy daddy

12
00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.020
He is driving

13
00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:58.410
How long will it take to survive?

14
00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:00.120
He is a driver

15
00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.100
He turns it on

16
00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:02.860
It was obviously from the car.

17
00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:04.080
But the boot room

18
00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:07.000
You are the dead emperor

19
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.120
death is important

20
00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:11.580
Relevant to the rationale of Jiangshan Design

21
00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.640
Should be low in popularity

22
00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:16.680
It's wrong to borrow the emperor's low blood and popularity

23
00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:21.760
It seems that someone is still determined to use the dead emperor to

24
00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:23.270
Cheng Yuan has low blood popularity

25
00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:24.670
Yes, married

26
00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.030
your blood wish

27
00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:27.590
This family is going crazy, right?

28
00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:31.030
I really thought I was really not you
