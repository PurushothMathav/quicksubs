00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.560
It’s so-called to prevent your wealth from entering,

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.190
Tell the truth,

3
00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:07.810
But saying there is no reward,

4
00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:10.010
If the emperor dies again, what party will respond to you?

5
00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:12.770
You don’t have to explore here, lead the prince to bully us and learn,

6
00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:16.149
Since you saw it, can you tell me what you saw?

7
00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:19.690
You want to say learn,

8
00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:23.590
Say learn, say learn, prepare me, enough,

9
00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:28.280
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah,

10
00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:30.320
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah,

11
00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.860
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah,

12
00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:35.440
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah,

13
00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.410
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah,

14
00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:42.870
But never went too far

15
00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:43.810
Here comes the public

16
00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:45.280
I just talk in the water

17
00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:46.260
Don't look at loneliness

18
00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:49.450
What a disappointment

19
00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:51.230
Huang Pu, who even felt me, went to retreat to the Wentang Hall

20
00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:52.170
Isn't it?

21
00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.670
Regardless of whether you are young or old, you will be anonymous.

22
00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:56.670
It is said that the withdrawal of Wentang is for the public good.

23
00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.190
If it were not for the protection of my children and ministers, I would not be alive

24
00:00:58.190 --> 00:00:59.370
Can be self-righteous

25
00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:03.850
I didn’t want to be the white patient’s dead father.

26
00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:05.670
Withdrawal of bail without loyalty

27
00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.410
Just the evidence to prove your innocence
