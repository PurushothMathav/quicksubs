00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:07.460
Prince, eldest prince? Ah? What's going on?

2
00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:11.300
My subordinate wants to remind you to be careful if your colleagues close their eyes.

3
00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:13.220
What does it mean? Your Majesty, now,

4
00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:16.079
It's your world, the most prince fighting for Chu Jun, etc.

5
00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:17.380
The eyes have already been killed.

6
00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.380
Among them, the third prince is in charge,

7
00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:21.460
I hate Shou Lang the most.

8
00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:23.240
During the Ming Dynasty, the two princes who were the director of the song,

9
00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:25.640
So maybe it's too much or something.

10
00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.660
So what you mean is, I am the eldest prince,

11
00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:28.820
Take me into the public house.

12
00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.910
If you want to take over on your own, that's mainly not the case. Really. fine

13
00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:35.610
Those who fight hard to surrender to the party are particularly special

14
00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.430
I don't believe I can't deal with some seemingly

15
00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:46.690
Don't be scared. It's hurt.

16
00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:53.980
How dare you hit Huang?

17
00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:55.110
Still not giving up

18
00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:56.810
Let me see who comes in doing what
