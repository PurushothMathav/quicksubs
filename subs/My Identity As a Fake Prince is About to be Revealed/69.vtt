00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:05.430
I'm trying to write. If you read nonsense again, you're welcome to mess up the book.

2
00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:08.930
I've tried the wording, this is not a local translation,

3
00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:10.710
That's really what I'm saying.

4
00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:15.390
How can this little piece of light have nothing to do for you?

5
00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:18.130
If you donâ€™t believe me, let me point you to a few more centers.

6
00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:19.950
Don't touch, touch, touch, touch

7
00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:20.730
Don't touch, touch, touch

8
00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:23.290
Don't touch, touch, don't touch

9
00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:24.090
Don't touch it

10
00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.050
Weren't you very popular just now?

11
00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:27.150
i like you very much

12
00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:27.930
Those are the things you most want to avoid

13
00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.230
Give me another show

14
00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:31.430
Do you have any flowers? Tell me.

15
00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:32.290
How dare you sell it?

16
00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:34.170
bump bump bump bump bump bump bump bump bump bump bump bump bump bump bump bump bump bump bump bump bump bump bump bump bump bump bump bump bump bump bump bump bump bump bump bump bump bump bump

17
00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.970
You dare to threaten to apply in person to me?

18
00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:39.860
Donâ€™t want to watch it yet

19
00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.180
How dare you go out and get into a fight?

20
00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:43.530
Not yet, not yet

21
00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.090
remember what you said

22
00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.450
If you are speaking

23
00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:48.170
I have hundreds or thousands of guarantees

24
00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:51.190
I see the earthen altar is placed where you are holding the dog.

25
00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:53.530
No, no, no, no, no

26
00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:55.820
What about me?

27
00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.250
I rely on this man

28
00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:00.470
Did you say what you did?

29
00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:01.570
Don't make Han money

30
00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:07.860
I'll be with you as a member of the Rong Hold Dog

31
00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:12.300
My father, Chen, hurry up and get out before he changes his doctrine.
