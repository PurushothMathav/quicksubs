00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:09.400
Do you still want to buy it? Don’t let me disgrace you today.

2
00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.500
Yes, where did you say this?

3
00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.620
Now we are already on the same line,

4
00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.440
How could I see you throwing it away?

5
00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:19.140
How did it end with your cooperation?

6
00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:26.510
But no matter what, I am still a Jiaoshe student.

7
00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:29.490
I'm sorry, don't blame me for pretending to be a traitor.

8
00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:32.460
It's just that I've tried it until now, and it's a big wasteland,

9
00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.300
Such a powerful message has been created,

10
00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:36.880
Still like this brothers.

11
00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:39.400
I'm waiting for this to look like the Public Security Law

12
00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:40.840
must be subject to

13
00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:42.320
His Majesty’s City Law

14
00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:46.950
I shouldn't have believed that you could ascend to the throne in the first place

15
00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:51.530
I plan to go back to visit His Majesty

16
00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:02.490
Everyone knows how to take advantage of me

17
00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:04.260
Prince Bei didn't even think about it.

18
00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.860
He can actually create something like this

19
00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:08.390
Please trust me again

20
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.100
This time it will be a week's work

21
00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:13.310
I don’t know what Prince Wu’s plans are

22
00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:14.760
I have checked

23
00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.860
My great emperor brother's life will be shaken today

24
00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:19.230
With such a strong life, let’s talk about it

25
00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:23.520
I'm also afraid that he won't give me an estimate of the soil formula.

26
00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:24.800
You don't have to worry

27
00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:27.420
I can't explain it like a hot pot

28
00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:28.360
So you come

29
00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:29.990
Are you still afraid of your Number Emperor?

30
00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:33.550
It’s really true that you have more space to try words

31
00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.150
Then me and my wife

32
00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:37.330
What good thing does he want?

33
00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:42.670
Of course he talks a lot.

34
00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:43.880
don't need our

35
00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:53.550
don't need our

36
00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:54.210
Not worthy of subsidy

37
00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.550
But then it’s easy to calculate

38
00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:58.610
I really believe you once

39
00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:00.590
As long as the two are located, I can match it well

40
00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:02.610
When the time comes, I will be known as Fuguang

41
00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.230
Judge the country's crimes in one go

42
00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:05.880
Or this big Guangzhou

43
00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.259
can only create this place
