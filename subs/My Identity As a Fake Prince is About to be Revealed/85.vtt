00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:15.070
Prince, what's the point? Forget it,

2
00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:16.870
Please give me a ticket,

3
00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:18.450
Son, what do you want to eat?

4
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.840
How could he leave? That son,

5
00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.000
Son, I want my father to take care of me.

6
00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:28.670
What are you going to give this throne to, my father?

7
00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:30.450
Father, father really wants this,

8
00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:32.630
You were not like this before,

9
00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:34.250
But there really is no equivalent generation,

10
00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:36.310
Why do you want to meet your father?

11
00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.780
It's not because of you,

12
00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.100
If it weren't for you, then I'd be drunk,

13
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.300
Letâ€™s go back to Chongqing

14
00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:44.230
How could he be raped by Brother Three Kingdoms again?

15
00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:46.570
Mother divides her money and gives him one time to let me

16
00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:48.150
Are they surprised at every turn?

17
00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:49.970
You have to save your life

18
00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:51.030
Pretending everywhere

19
00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.970
Not interested in anything

20
00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:54.090
I still have to inject it into you

21
00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.030
What kind of dog leash is it?

22
00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:00.570
I'm asking you this one last time

23
00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:03.320
Please be strict, right?

24
00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:05.730
Then I will kill

25
00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:08.360
This is called talking about myself

26
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:11.280
mom mom wife

27
00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:13.440
You let the sad master blame you

28
00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.100
Items that will be used

29
00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.040
The commander who comes up will tell you

30
00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:18.160
Do I have to understand it?

31
00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.200
This old guy is not trying to pass Huang Wei on to you.

32
00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:24.700
He begged you to write it.

33
00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.560
This old guy will definitely die unknown.

34
00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.960
Can't stop
