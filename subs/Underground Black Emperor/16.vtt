00:00:01.766 --> 00:00:06.300
Uh, Mr. Jiang, I'm the president of the Li Group

2
00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:08.566
Li Jinke before?

3
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:10.166
We met at the cocktail party

4
00:00:10.766 --> 00:00:12.266
What shit Lee

5
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:13.800
Never heard of it

6
00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.066
I didn't decide

7
00:00:16.533 --> 00:00:19.233
Are you with them?

8
00:00:19.666 --> 00:00:21.166
This is my girlfriend.

9
00:00:21.166 --> 00:00:23.500
Girlfriend?

10
00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.400
Isn't this little cripple's mother?

11
00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.733
Ah, not the father of this little cripple

12
00:00:29.733 --> 00:00:33.233
Why did I become your girlfriend again?

13
00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:34.500
These two

14
00:00:35.133 --> 00:00:36.900
Ex-wife ex-wife

15
00:00:37.166 --> 00:00:41.100
Uh, Mr. Jiang, this injustice has a head and a debt

16
00:00:42.866 --> 00:00:44.266
What's that?

17
00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.166
What a shit council group

18
00:00:46.166 --> 00:00:49.700
I have never heard of it, and it is also worthy of the young master to give me face.

19
00:00:52.366 --> 00:00:54.566
But you mother and daughter

20
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.400
I can give you some face

21
00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.100
As long as you stay with me for one night

22
00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.400
I'm done talking, I don't care

23
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.133
How is it, hahahahaha?

24
00:01:04.133 --> 00:01:06.533
Damn it!

25
00:01:06.533 --> 00:01:08.833
Forgot about you bastard

26
00:01:09.066 --> 00:01:09.466
sir

27
00:01:09.466 --> 00:01:12.266
I haven't been beaten like this since I was a kid

28
00:01:12.566 --> 00:01:15.666
I tell you today you still have you

29
00:01:16.133 --> 00:01:18.600
I'm going to break your hands and legs

30
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.333
Let you see that ex-wife with your own eyes

31
00:01:20.333 --> 00:01:22.966
And how your daughter was played by me

32
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.500
Bastard business

33
00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.566
Do you still think the trouble is not big enough?
