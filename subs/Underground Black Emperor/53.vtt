00:00:01.066 --> 00:00:03.200
Who dares to make trouble with me?

2
00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:04.933
Darling, you're finally here

3
00:00:04.933 --> 00:00:06.066
It's them who make trouble

4
00:00:06.066 --> 00:00:07.500
Look at him.

5
00:00:07.566 --> 00:00:09.966
He hit me. Look

6
00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:12.266
Honey, are you alright?

7
00:00:12.566 --> 00:00:15.400
It hurts, please help them take revenge

8
00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:18.066
What's the matter, you're the only one

9
00:00:18.066 --> 00:00:20.600
How dare you make trouble here in my fucking place

10
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:23.233
Someone bring me to the security department

11
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.900
Xiaoyan, is this your boyfriend?

12
00:00:26.966 --> 00:00:29.500
You have the nerve to say that we are being raised

13
00:00:30.133 --> 00:00:33.100
You are the one who is being cared for, right?

14
00:00:33.366 --> 00:00:34.366
You fart

15
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.266
I'm flying with us, but it's true love

16
00:00:38.933 --> 00:00:41.100
Okay, don't explain to them

17
00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.066
Dare to make trouble on my turf

18
00:00:43.066 --> 00:00:44.200
Dare to hit people

19
00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:47.033
Security took them to me

20
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.300
Hey, he was the one who killed the man first

21
00:00:50.366 --> 00:00:51.900
I just hit him

22
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.366
We are here to consume

23
00:00:53.366 --> 00:00:55.266
This is how you treat your customers, right?

24
00:00:55.266 --> 00:00:58.000
What kind of customers are they?

25
00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.500
To them

26
00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.266
They're not here to buy a car

27
00:01:01.266 --> 00:01:02.333
Dear, um.

28
00:01:02.333 --> 00:01:05.666
That guy is a thug who runs a food stall

29
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.166
How can you possibly afford a car?

30
00:01:09.166 --> 00:01:12.300
Dear, you must believe me.

31
00:01:13.066 --> 00:01:14.566
You help me out of this breath

32
00:01:14.566 --> 00:01:17.000
I'll treat you good evening

33
00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:21.666
So brave

34
00:01:21.666 --> 00:01:23.466
Dare to make trouble in my car dealership

35
00:01:23.566 --> 00:01:26.166
Security took them to me
