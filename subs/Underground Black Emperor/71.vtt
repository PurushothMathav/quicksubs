00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:04.466
Wait a minute, why are you afraid and ask for mercy?

2
00:00:04.466 --> 00:00:05.600
Excuse me

3
00:00:06.333 --> 00:00:08.633
This five-star banquet hall is set by us.

4
00:00:08.966 --> 00:00:10.966
Why do you say we impersonated him?

5
00:00:10.966 --> 00:00:12.266
Robbed his birthday party again?

6
00:00:12.266 --> 00:00:13.633
You're still here?

7
00:00:13.733 --> 00:00:16.500
I finally know what Shangliang Buzheng means

8
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:17.466
The lower beam is crooked.

9
00:00:17.466 --> 00:00:20.066
This is called a dragon

10
00:00:20.266 --> 00:00:24.166
The daughter of the phoenix rat can punch holes

11
00:00:24.733 --> 00:00:25.900
Hehe uncle

12
00:00:26.533 --> 00:00:28.066
It just so happens that he also has a birthday today.

13
00:00:28.066 --> 00:00:29.166
Also called Zhenzhen

14
00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:30.966
He insisted on saying that this was their decision.

15
00:00:30.966 --> 00:00:33.133
I explained everything to him and he just wouldn't listen

16
00:00:33.133 --> 00:00:34.733
Well, I really haven't seen it.

17
00:00:34.733 --> 00:00:36.166
Someone who feels so good about themselves

18
00:00:36.166 --> 00:00:37.866
I feel good about myself.

19
00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.966
Xu Wanwan, open your dog eyes and see clearly

20
00:00:40.966 --> 00:00:45.100
I am the only daughter of the president of the Hong Zhenzhen Suzaku Association

21
00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:47.633
And he's a dead cripple

22
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.366
His father is a stall selling food stalls

23
00:00:50.466 --> 00:00:52.800
Who among us can afford a banquet hall like this?

24
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.166
You can see it at a glance.

25
00:00:54.166 --> 00:00:56.466
The daughter Hong Daying was talking about last night

26
00:00:56.466 --> 00:00:57.566
It's your dad.

27
00:00:57.566 --> 00:00:59.033
You met my father?

28
00:00:59.333 --> 00:01:00.466
More than knowing

29
00:01:00.466 --> 00:01:02.866
Your father kowtowed to uncle last night

30
00:01:02.866 --> 00:01:04.966
Said he wanted to save his life for his daughter's birthday

31
00:01:04.966 --> 00:01:06.466
Uncle is letting him go

32
00:01:06.466 --> 00:01:09.166
Xu Wanwan, if you talk nonsense again, tear your mouth apart.

33
00:01:09.166 --> 00:01:09.966
Xu Wanwan

34
00:01:10.266 --> 00:01:12.900
You even dare to choreograph the president of the Vermilion Bird Club

35
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.000
You don't want to die

36
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.300
Zhenzhen was also arguing at the time

37
00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:16.566
If you don't believe me, ask him.

38
00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.300
I know you're the daughter of a mob boss

39
00:01:20.366 --> 00:01:22.366
I didn't dare to resist when I was bullied before

40
00:01:22.366 --> 00:01:23.733
But now it seems

41
00:01:23.733 --> 00:01:27.400
Your father is far worse than my father

42
00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:28.900
Pardon me?
