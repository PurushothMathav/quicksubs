1
00:00:01.066 --> 00:00:03.033
What total annihilation?

2
00:00:03.166 --> 00:00:05.666
Although the evidence found after the army was useless

3
00:00:05.866 --> 00:00:08.200
But you were focused on dealing with big brother

4
00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:09.600
But gave him the troops

5
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:11.966
Isn't this asking the mouse to open the granary?

6
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.233
No metaphors, no metaphors

7
00:00:14.533 --> 00:00:16.800
So what about you?

8
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.600
Now even professional is not my match

9
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.600
Even the Xuanbing Sword will be cut to pieces

10
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.566
I have the same strength to get rid of you

11
00:00:22.566 --> 00:00:24.266
This is why you are fighting

12
00:00:24.266 --> 00:00:25.466
Between the Temples

13
00:00:25.466 --> 00:00:28.766
Not bad, what will you use against me when the magic weapon is broken?

14
00:00:28.766 --> 00:00:30.900
I said it when I taught you Wuyi

15
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.100
Don't rely too much on the power of the sword

16
00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:35.200
Hahahahaha

17
00:00:35.266 --> 00:00:37.166
What a shame

18
00:00:37.166 --> 00:00:39.833
Do you know why I sealed the knife before?

19
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.066
Because the highest state of martial arts

20
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.800
Never a weapon

21
00:00:46.966 --> 00:00:48.866
But people don't

22
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:49.900
That's not possible.

23
00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.700
If it weren't for you to tell the truth with your own mouth

24
00:00:52.766 --> 00:00:54.900
I already took your life

25
00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.233
Brother, this is the medicine you asked me to find

26
00:01:03.533 --> 00:01:05.600
This is the Life Creation Pill of Longhu Mountain

27
00:01:05.666 --> 00:01:07.300
Flesh and bones of the living dead

28
00:01:07.666 --> 00:01:09.400
Treat Miss Minjin's Legs

29
00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.033
It's hard work to ensure that the medicine will cure the disease.

30
00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.300
I also invite you to lurk during this time

31
00:01:18.166 --> 00:01:20.366
He works hard, don't I work hard?

32
00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:22.266
You worked so hard

33
00:01:22.266 --> 00:01:24.166
Lie down on the ground and pretend to be injured

34
00:01:24.333 --> 00:01:26.000
I'm playing Infernal Affairs

35
00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.133
Big brother should care about me too

36
00:01:28.133 --> 00:01:29.633
Should be shit

37
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.066
I'm also running around, okay?

38
00:01:32.366 --> 00:01:33.866
Say one more word.

39
00:01:33.866 --> 00:01:36.000
Be careful, I really beat you into a pig, don't make a fuss

40
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Stop for a while
