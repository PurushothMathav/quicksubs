00:00:01.133 --> 00:00:02.700
I'm so sorry.

2
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.300
Dad disabled your leg.

3
00:00:05.533 --> 00:00:07.066
He was ridiculed.

4
00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:08.633
It's all dad's fault

5
00:00:08.966 --> 00:00:09.866
Fortunately

6
00:00:10.766 --> 00:00:12.666
Now there is a chance to make up for it.

7
00:00:13.166 --> 00:00:16.166
Dad, I never blamed you

8
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:18.500
Thanks.

9
00:00:19.666 --> 00:00:20.500
Eat it.

10
00:00:21.366 --> 00:00:22.800
It will be fine.

11
00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:32.066
If this medicine doesn't work

12
00:00:32.066 --> 00:00:33.833
Or it's bad for my goddaughter

13
00:00:34.166 --> 00:00:35.900
I'll beat your leg off

14
00:00:36.566 --> 00:00:38.800
Does it really work?

15
00:00:39.566 --> 00:00:40.433
How did it go?

16
00:00:43.866 --> 00:00:45.400
Dad, my legs are fine

17
00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:46.766
My legs are fine.

18
00:00:46.866 --> 00:00:49.066
Thank you dad that's great

19
00:00:49.166 --> 00:00:50.666
What else do you say to dad?

20
00:00:50.733 --> 00:00:53.000
Hahaha, if you want

21
00:00:53.566 --> 00:00:55.000
You can move back now.

22
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.166
Don't get me wrong

23
00:00:56.166 --> 00:00:57.500
What I mean is...

24
00:00:57.766 --> 00:00:59.400
I really need you as a father

25
00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.900
Then you are not afraid that Zhenzhen will not be safe with me.

26
00:01:03.533 --> 00:01:05.433
It took so much to understand

27
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.066
It is safest to be by your side

28
00:01:09.166 --> 00:01:11.166
Don't bother with that.

29
00:01:12.066 --> 00:01:14.266
I'm in charge of my goddaughter

30
00:01:14.533 --> 00:01:17.400
Brother, my bed is big and soft.

31
00:01:17.533 --> 00:01:19.633
Why don't you move in with me?

32
00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.533
Brother, this is the ticket for Liu Tianhou's tour concert.

33
00:01:24.533 --> 00:01:26.866
You promised to go to the concert with me

34
00:01:26.966 --> 00:01:29.633
What? When did you promise?

35
00:01:30.366 --> 00:01:32.800
No good talking nonsense, I can go undercover

36
00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.766
Hmph, after tomorrow?

37
00:01:34.866 --> 00:01:37.800
After all these years, you still don't give up on big brother?

38
00:01:38.266 --> 00:01:39.466
You didn't give up

39
00:01:39.466 --> 00:01:41.000
Why should I give up?

40
00:01:41.133 --> 00:01:41.566
Humph

41
00:01:41.566 --> 00:01:44.200
Uncle, they are so old, you should choose me.

42
00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.866
Oh, don't get involved in this kind of thing.

43
00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.333
Why should I ignore them?

44
00:01:49.333 --> 00:01:50.266
You shut up

45
00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:53.000
Uncle, stop, stop
