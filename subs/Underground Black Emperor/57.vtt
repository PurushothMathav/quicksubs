00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:02.566
You are the thief

2
00:00:02.566 --> 00:00:04.700
This card was given to my dad by my stepmother

3
00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:06.100
How could it be stolen?

4
00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:08.466
Stepmother hum

5
00:00:08.533 --> 00:00:10.900
You have a stepmother

6
00:00:12.266 --> 00:00:15.166
Could it be your father?

7
00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:18.266
Where did you find an 80-year-old rich woman?

8
00:00:18.266 --> 00:00:19.533
Stole his card

9
00:00:19.533 --> 00:00:20.700
What nonsense are you talking about?

10
00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.666
My stepmother is young and beautiful

11
00:00:22.666 --> 00:00:25.366
Young and beautiful woman

12
00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.333
How can you possibly like your father?

13
00:00:27.333 --> 00:00:28.333
picture him what?

14
00:00:28.333 --> 00:00:30.733
Tuta egg fried rice is well fried

15
00:00:30.733 --> 00:00:32.800
My egg fried rice is really good

16
00:00:32.966 --> 00:00:36.800
Hahaha, okay, okay.

17
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.100
You are amazing, even with people like you

18
00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:41.600
You find a rich woman

19
00:00:41.866 --> 00:00:43.000
It should be that kind.

20
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.666
An old and ugly old fat woman, right?

21
00:00:45.666 --> 00:00:47.000
Hum okay baby

22
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.466
Don't talk nonsense with these people

23
00:00:48.466 --> 00:00:49.266
Come

24
00:00:49.966 --> 00:00:51.800
Arrest these thieves for me

25
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.400
Break your hands and feet and throw them out

26
00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.066
Why do you call my dad a thief?

27
00:00:56.333 --> 00:00:57.733
You're still being stubborn

28
00:00:57.733 --> 00:00:59.766
Your dad admitted it himself

29
00:00:59.766 --> 00:01:01.633
This card is not his.

30
00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:03.300
It wasn't stolen by the uncle

31
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.766
You really don't cry when you see the coffin?

32
00:01:05.766 --> 00:01:08.233
Stealing from someone else is a felony

33
00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:11.266
Enough to feed you for years of fucking trouble

34
00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.866
Dad, don't worry, a little misunderstanding

35
00:01:13.866 --> 00:01:15.966
I'll fix it with a phone call.

36
00:01:16.166 --> 00:01:18.200
Why are you calling?

37
00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.333
Could it be

38
00:01:19.333 --> 00:01:22.300
Get ready to call your 80-year-old rich woman to intercede

39
00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:24.633
Wang Xiaoyan, shut up for me

40
00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.000
I poked the sore spot, right?

41
00:01:27.333 --> 00:01:29.700
For the sake of everyone's classmates

42
00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.100
I'll give you a trick

43
00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:32.000
How about you?

44
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.100
No need to intercede with that 80-year-old rich woman

45
00:01:35.133 --> 00:01:37.466
Just intercede for us again

46
00:01:37.766 --> 00:01:39.766
Hey, so

47
00:01:39.766 --> 00:01:42.066
Don't say I didn't give you a chance.

48
00:01:42.133 --> 00:01:44.500
The shoes promised by our family are dirty.

49
00:01:44.566 --> 00:01:46.600
You let your useless dad

50
00:01:46.866 --> 00:01:49.666
Come and lick the shoes we promised

51
00:01:49.866 --> 00:01:52.400
Forget it today
