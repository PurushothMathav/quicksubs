00:00:09.133 --> 00:00:10.100
Thanks, Dad.

2
00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:12.300
You're welcome. These are from the bookstall.

3
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.266
Just thank him when he comes

4
00:00:14.266 --> 00:00:16.233
I will definitely thank you very much, little mother.

5
00:00:16.533 --> 00:00:17.600
What mom

6
00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:18.900
I am your future mother

7
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.133
You die for me

8
00:00:20.133 --> 00:00:21.166
Who allowed you to say little mother?

9
00:00:21.166 --> 00:00:22.500
In the future, we will each have our own

10
00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:24.166
I call you sister, you call me little mom

11
00:00:24.166 --> 00:00:25.100
Shameless

12
00:00:25.366 --> 00:00:27.866
Dad, oh uncle, oh

13
00:00:27.866 --> 00:00:29.333
You two have been arguing all the way

14
00:00:29.333 --> 00:00:30.933
I said it was a misunderstanding

15
00:00:30.933 --> 00:00:31.933
What a misunderstanding

16
00:00:31.933 --> 00:00:34.500
I really like your uncle, don't even think about it.

17
00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.200
I'm going out for a cigarette

18
00:00:36.866 --> 00:00:39.133
Dad, stop smoking, it's alright, it's alright

19
00:00:39.133 --> 00:00:40.766
Uncle, what kind of cigarettes do you usually like to smoke?

20
00:00:40.766 --> 00:00:42.066
Do you want me to buy it for you?

21
00:00:42.066 --> 00:00:43.733
You call me Zhenzhen

22
00:00:43.733 --> 00:00:45.566
Why don't you two talk?

23
00:00:45.566 --> 00:00:48.066
Oops, you don't need to play those meanings.

24
00:00:48.066 --> 00:00:48.966
Are you serious?

25
00:00:48.966 --> 00:00:50.066
Of course I'm serious.

26
00:00:50.066 --> 00:00:51.733
Do you think I'm joking?

27
00:00:51.733 --> 00:00:53.200
That's my dad!

28
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.666
Isn't that better?

29
00:00:55.666 --> 00:00:58.800
Okay, you sister, you cripple, get out of here
