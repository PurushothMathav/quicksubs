1
00:00:00.566 --> 00:00:01.900
This guy again

2
00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.100
Looks like this guy is doing well now

3
00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:05.366
What a cat and a dog

4
00:00:05.366 --> 00:00:07.233
Come and pull his tiger skin as a flag

5
00:00:07.733 --> 00:00:09.900
What is your identity?

6
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.600
He actually called Tiger Lord by his name

7
00:00:11.733 --> 00:00:13.533
The so-called tiger master in your mouth

8
00:00:13.533 --> 00:00:16.400
Now helping me cook in my food stall

9
00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:17.600
Help me entertain guests

10
00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:18.400
or

11
00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.300
I'll take you to taste his cooking later.

12
00:00:21.333 --> 00:00:22.833
Business is Enough

13
00:00:22.933 --> 00:00:24.533
You think you're bragging here?

14
00:00:24.533 --> 00:00:26.933
I can find your face in Li Shao

15
00:00:26.933 --> 00:00:29.033
I still think it makes me look up to you

16
00:00:30.966 --> 00:00:32.466
Zhang Yi, I advise you

17
00:00:33.666 --> 00:00:34.666
Wake up

18
00:00:35.366 --> 00:00:36.633
You're getting old.

19
00:00:36.966 --> 00:00:38.800
Don't always live in your own dreams

20
00:00:38.866 --> 00:00:41.966
Li Wei, I have never spoken big words to you

21
00:00:41.966 --> 00:00:44.066
Shut up. What did you say?

22
00:00:44.066 --> 00:00:47.366
You said you'd bring it back really safe

23
00:00:47.366 --> 00:00:48.800
But what happened?

24
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.133
Zhenzhen's legs haven't been neat yet

25
00:00:51.133 --> 00:00:53.600
Do you know how miserable he has been these past few years?

26
00:01:01.766 --> 00:01:05.800
Hahahahaha

27
00:01:07.133 --> 00:01:07.933
Ah!

28
00:01:10.533 --> 00:01:13.800
Mom, I can't move my legs.

29
00:01:16.066 --> 00:01:20.466
It's okay, dad will take you to see a doctor, hold on

30
00:01:22.366 --> 00:01:23.300
I see.

31
00:01:24.133 --> 00:01:25.433
I'm sorry, really.

32
00:01:25.566 --> 00:01:27.166
I don't expect you to forgive me

33
00:01:27.166 --> 00:01:28.300
I only hope

34
00:01:28.366 --> 00:01:30.566
You and Zhenzhen can give me a chance to make amends

35
00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.133
What do you take to make up for it?

36
00:01:32.133 --> 00:01:33.766
Look at your clothes

37
00:01:34.166 --> 00:01:35.733
And the smell of oil fumes

38
00:01:35.733 --> 00:01:37.000
I heard Wei Wei say

39
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.300
You set up a food stall.

40
00:01:38.366 --> 00:01:41.300
A month, be diligent, it's only a few thousand dollars

41
00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:42.166
What can you do?

42
00:01:42.166 --> 00:01:43.133
I'm not short of money

43
00:01:43.133 --> 00:01:44.400
As long as they need it

44
00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:45.900
I can give you anything you want.

45
00:01:45.933 --> 00:01:48.333
Hmph, you can get as much money as you want.

46
00:01:48.333 --> 00:01:50.033
You really know how to brag!

47
00:01:50.533 --> 00:01:52.200
Look at you now.

48
00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.666
Can you take out 10,000 yuan?

49
00:01:55.266 --> 00:01:56.700
Wei Wei I know

50
00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.566
He must be trying to use your daughter's name.

51
00:01:59.566 --> 00:02:01.233
I want money for you.
