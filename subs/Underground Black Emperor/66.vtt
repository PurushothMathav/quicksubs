00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:02.866
Zhenzhen, you are here

2
00:00:03.966 --> 00:00:06.466
I don't care, you drop it for me.

3
00:00:07.766 --> 00:00:10.566
Hello dad

4
00:00:11.366 --> 00:00:13.066
Zhenzhen, what's wrong?

5
00:00:13.166 --> 00:00:14.466
It's my birthday!

6
00:00:14.466 --> 00:00:15.800
My dad didn't get me a restaurant reservation

7
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.000
Hang up on me

8
00:00:17.066 --> 00:00:19.166
Uncle Red may be busy for a while

9
00:00:19.166 --> 00:00:20.466
So did my uncle last night.

10
00:00:20.466 --> 00:00:21.833
He hasn't come back yet.

11
00:00:21.933 --> 00:00:22.866
Don't worry.

12
00:00:22.866 --> 00:00:24.933
Isn't it just a grand sky garden?

13
00:00:24.933 --> 00:00:25.866
I'll solve it for you.

14
00:00:25.866 --> 00:00:26.800
I don't believe it.

15
00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:27.766
In this Yunzhou

16
00:00:27.766 --> 00:00:30.066
There are still people who can not give you the face of the eldest lady

17
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.100
How do you want to solve it?

18
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.466
Who ordered this five-star hall today?

19
00:00:36.466 --> 00:00:37.533
Sorry, sir.

20
00:00:37.533 --> 00:00:39.766
We cannot disclose customer information.

21
00:00:41.133 --> 00:00:43.366
Don't worry, we won't trouble you.

22
00:00:43.366 --> 00:00:44.933
You just have to tell me who it is.

23
00:00:44.933 --> 00:00:46.366
I'll find him to solve it myself

24
00:00:46.366 --> 00:00:49.333
This is the apple of the eye of the president of the Suzaku Association

25
00:00:49.333 --> 00:00:50.533
And my uncle

26
00:00:50.533 --> 00:00:52.100
The president of the Xuanwu Association

27
00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.100
Do you know what happened to the two of us?

28
00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.333
Actually, I don't know who it is

29
00:00:56.333 --> 00:00:58.966
I only know that it is a real lady's birthday

30
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.366
Miss Zhenzhen

31
00:01:00.566 --> 00:01:02.100
Didn't your dad say he didn't make an order for you?

32
00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.466
That's what my dad said

33
00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:05.533
Oh, I see.

34
00:01:05.533 --> 00:01:07.266
Uncle must have wanted to surprise you

35
00:01:07.466 --> 00:01:08.666
Is that so?

36
00:01:08.666 --> 00:01:10.400
It must be so.

37
00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:11.600
Oops, really?

38
00:01:11.766 --> 00:01:15.000
What's the matter, I just saw that dead cripple

39
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.566
Entering the VIP elevator

40
00:01:16.933 --> 00:01:18.200
But I'm still thinking

41
00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.400
How could he possibly enter this five-star hall?

42
00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.700
It seems that the waiter recognized him as you

43
00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.033
Don't forget that his name is also Zhenzhen, Zhenzhen
