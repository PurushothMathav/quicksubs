00:00:00.866 --> 00:00:02.033
What is robbery?

2
00:00:02.133 --> 00:00:04.866
We're here to get justice for my lady

3
00:00:04.866 --> 00:00:06.366
Hey, I've never seen it before.

4
00:00:06.366 --> 00:00:07.566
Shameless people like you

5
00:00:07.566 --> 00:00:09.300
Obviously this idiot stole our territory first

6
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:10.000
Rob us again

7
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.366
Why should he seek justice?

8
00:00:11.366 --> 00:00:13.800
Don't say it, they're just playing on a topic

9
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.366
Damn cripple can't see that you're pretty smart

10
00:00:16.366 --> 00:00:18.100
We just play off the topic

11
00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:20.166
Weren't you still very arrogant just now?

12
00:00:20.166 --> 00:00:22.000
Don't you even look down on the four major gangs?

13
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.933
Why are you cowardly now that President Hong has come?

14
00:00:24.933 --> 00:00:27.066
Which eye did you see that we were cowardly?

15
00:00:27.133 --> 00:00:28.833
You're going to die, you're going to socialize.

16
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.600
I kind of appreciate it.

17
00:00:30.933 --> 00:00:34.266
Seeing that you are holding a sword, you should also be a martial artist

18
00:00:34.266 --> 00:00:36.000
But it's just you.

19
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.866
Can you win the brothers of the Suzaku Club?

20
00:00:38.866 --> 00:00:40.333
A group of local chickens and dogs

21
00:00:40.333 --> 00:00:42.266
I don't think so

22
00:00:42.266 --> 00:00:43.700
Why are you afraid?

23
00:00:43.966 --> 00:00:45.766
Humph cripple

24
00:00:45.766 --> 00:00:48.466
Didn't you always say how amazing your dad was?

25
00:00:48.466 --> 00:00:50.133
Look at him now

26
00:00:50.133 --> 00:00:51.600
I bah Wang Xiaoyan

27
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.866
I was too soft on you before

28
00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:55.966
I really won't let you go this time.

29
00:00:55.966 --> 00:00:58.066
Leave me alone, cripple

30
00:00:58.066 --> 00:00:59.633
Don't you still think

31
00:00:59.666 --> 00:01:02.466
That devil will come to save you

32
00:01:02.466 --> 00:01:04.333
What is a devil

33
00:01:04.333 --> 00:01:06.166
Don't say he can't make it.

34
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:07.566
Even if it comes

35
00:01:07.566 --> 00:01:09.066
He is just a tiger

36
00:01:09.066 --> 00:01:10.500
Just a dog

37
00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.600
How to talk to my husband, right?

38
00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:14.133
Husband, what's the matter with you?

39
00:01:14.133 --> 00:01:14.966
Are you talking?

40
00:01:14.966 --> 00:01:17.466
Yes, President Hong has come

41
00:01:17.466 --> 00:01:18.633
Say a word

42
00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:20.600
Brother, brother, forgive me.
