00:00:01.566 --> 00:00:04.566
What a big tone dad

2
00:00:04.566 --> 00:00:06.433
You're finally here.

3
00:00:07.133 --> 00:00:08.300
My good daughter

4
00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:09.900
What's wrong with you?

5
00:00:09.966 --> 00:00:11.333
Why are you still crying?

6
00:00:11.333 --> 00:00:12.933
Hey, you have no conscience

7
00:00:12.933 --> 00:00:14.066
How did you come?

8
00:00:14.066 --> 00:00:17.033
What has our daughter been bullied by?

9
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:18.966
Dare to bully my daughter

10
00:00:21.466 --> 00:00:24.400
Hey, did you know there's a flock of fat sheep in there?

11
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:25.966
How fat is it?

12
00:00:26.366 --> 00:00:28.600
Fat sheep

13
00:00:28.666 --> 00:00:29.866
Coincidentally

14
00:00:29.866 --> 00:00:31.466
There's a little bitch in there

15
00:00:31.466 --> 00:00:33.166
It's also my birthday today.

16
00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:35.733
Guess how much he received as a gift?

17
00:00:35.733 --> 00:00:36.566
How much?

18
00:00:37.133 --> 00:00:38.166
500 million

19
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.666
What? I have 500 million.

20
00:00:41.733 --> 00:00:44.833
Yes, as long as we do this battle

21
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.833
Our family won't have to worry anymore

22
00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.033
With the backing of this money

23
00:00:50.133 --> 00:00:51.700
You Suzaku

24
00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:54.400
Will become the leader of the four major gangs in one fell swoop

25
00:00:54.766 --> 00:00:57.100
At that time, even if the tiger master

26
00:00:57.866 --> 00:00:59.100
He can't hold it down either

27
00:01:01.133 --> 00:01:03.966
But someone who can give such a big gift

28
00:01:04.066 --> 00:01:06.466
Certainly not ordinary people, Dad

29
00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:08.466
I know that bitch in there

30
00:01:08.466 --> 00:01:09.900
Just my college classmate

31
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.333
His family is a broken company

32
00:01:11.333 --> 00:01:12.466
No background whatsoever.

33
00:01:12.666 --> 00:01:14.900
I bullied him every day when I was in school

34
00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:16.900
It really is.

35
00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:20.033
Brother, is this a good opportunity?

36
00:01:20.066 --> 00:01:20.866
What do you mean?

37
00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.100
Since what happened last night

38
00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.233
It's not going to be easy in the future

39
00:01:27.166 --> 00:01:28.800
Let's do something bigger

40
00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:30.766
Change city

41
00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.433
Another hero
