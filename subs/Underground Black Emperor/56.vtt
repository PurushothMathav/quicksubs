Tiandi Monte Worker's No. 2 Black Gold Card

3
00:00:07.966 --> 00:00:08.900
It was stolen.

4
00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:11.400
The No. 2 black gold card is the one on the back.

5
00:00:11.766 --> 00:00:14.566
Yes, when the Black Emperor quit the rivers and lakes

6
00:00:14.566 --> 00:00:16.300
Cancelled the No. 1 black gold card

7
00:00:16.366 --> 00:00:18.300
No. 2 is in the existing black gold card.

8
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.466
The one with the highest rank

9
00:00:19.466 --> 00:00:21.366
User authentication for this card

10
00:00:21.366 --> 00:00:22.500
Is another person

11
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:23.500
A Man

12
00:00:23.666 --> 00:00:25.566
Where did the bold bag thief come from?

13
00:00:25.566 --> 00:00:27.600
He actually dared to steal something from behind

14
00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:28.833
Where is the credit card?

15
00:00:29.066 --> 00:00:30.366
Right at the paddle wheel mall

16
00:00:31.566 --> 00:00:33.800
Shit

17
00:00:33.966 --> 00:00:36.800
Dare to steal and destroy the black gold card in Lao Tzu's place

18
00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.566
This is a public humiliation of the Heaven and Earth Alliance

19
00:00:42.533 --> 00:00:44.333
Dad, what's the matter?

20
00:00:44.333 --> 00:00:46.900
I don't know either hahaha

21
00:00:47.066 --> 00:00:49.000
Is this card fucking yours?

22
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.766
Hahahaha

23
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:51.900
It was given to me by my friend.

24
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.833
I'll just call and ask.

25
00:00:53.866 --> 00:00:55.900
Why are you still calling?

26
00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.500
You've been exposed.

27
00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.500
Wang Xiaoyan, what do you mean?

28
00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:00.300
Revealed what?

29
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.866
I said he was a food stall owner

30
00:01:02.866 --> 00:01:04.366
How can you possibly have the money to buy a car?

31
00:01:04.366 --> 00:01:07.900
I don't know where I got a card from

32
00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:10.866
It's just that he doesn't know

33
00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:14.633
Identification is required to use this card

34
00:01:14.966 --> 00:01:16.766
It's been exposed now

35
00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.266
Darling, you see they are thieves, right?

36
00:01:19.266 --> 00:01:20.966
Hurry up and have someone take them away
