00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:02.100
Master, what are you doing?

2
00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:03.866
Are you all right?

3
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.966
Hum I tell you

4
00:00:07.266 --> 00:00:08.933
If it weren't for today

5
00:00:08.933 --> 00:00:12.400
I make you regret it for the rest of your life with one phone call

6
00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.033
I'd like to see it

7
00:00:14.333 --> 00:00:16.066
How did you make me regret it?

8
00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:18.766
Zhangye, you have disappointed me so much.

9
00:00:18.766 --> 00:00:21.100
I thought you would make some progress over the years

10
00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.466
I didn't expect you to be the same now

11
00:00:23.466 --> 00:00:26.233
When you encounter problems, you will use violence to solve problems

12
00:00:26.266 --> 00:00:28.400
My daughter's birthday present

13
00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.300
He dares to throw it away

14
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.066
What is he?

15
00:00:34.966 --> 00:00:36.566
Birthday present for your daughter

16
00:00:36.933 --> 00:00:39.466
Just this broken watch?

17
00:00:39.566 --> 00:00:41.766
What did you say about Liu Tianhou's collection?

18
00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.333
Who is Liu Tianhou?

19
00:00:43.333 --> 00:00:44.900
Countless fans around the world

20
00:00:44.966 --> 00:00:47.533
Do you think he will treasure this broken watch?

21
00:00:47.533 --> 00:00:48.333
Ah!

22
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.500
This watch was brought when I first debuted 6 days later.

23
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:52.966
It meant a lot to him.

24
00:00:53.333 --> 00:00:56.400
What are a few concert tickets?

25
00:00:57.466 --> 00:00:59.766
You take this watch to his agent

26
00:00:59.866 --> 00:01:02.233
You can directly enter the backstage to take a group photo with Liu Tianhou.

27
00:01:02.566 --> 00:01:04.000
Even if it is Liu Tiandan

28
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.233
You can also play a song for him alone

29
00:01:06.666 --> 00:01:08.066
Keep blowing

30
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.266
Master Zhang, I don't want to hear your nonsense here

31
00:01:12.966 --> 00:01:14.666
Take something and go immediately

32
00:01:15.133 --> 00:01:16.633
I don't want to see you again

33
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.366
I can go

34
00:01:19.933 --> 00:01:21.800
Give this watch to Zhenzhen for me.

35
00:01:23.133 --> 00:01:26.533
Mr. Dai, this watch is really collected by Liu Tianhou

36
00:01:26.533 --> 00:01:28.400
Even if it were true

37
00:01:28.466 --> 00:01:30.166
I can't let Zhenzhen take it either

38
00:01:30.166 --> 00:01:31.666
Besides, we both know

39
00:01:31.733 --> 00:01:33.733
Is this watch real or fake?

40
00:01:33.733 --> 00:01:34.533
Nagano

41
00:01:35.066 --> 00:01:36.500
I thought for so many years

42
00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.400
You should make some progress

43
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.066
I didn't expect you to be so tyrannical and arrogant

44
00:01:43.066 --> 00:01:44.366
self-righteous

45
00:01:45.066 --> 00:01:47.933
I will never let Zhenzhen

46
00:01:47.933 --> 00:01:50.966
It has nothing to do with you

47
00:01:50.966 --> 00:01:54.200
Because you don't deserve to be his father

48
00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:01.266
Don't worry.

49
00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.733
I will definitely treat you and be really nice.

50
00:02:03.733 --> 00:02:07.200
You know I'm a thousand times stronger than this scumbag

51
00:02:08.466 --> 00:02:10.866
Mr. Li, I think

52
00:02:11.966 --> 00:02:14.800
I'd better think about it again.

53
00:02:14.933 --> 00:02:16.766
I'll give you time to think about it. Hmm.

54
00:02:19.533 --> 00:02:20.500
Hello, Zhenzhen

55
00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:22.300
What's your trouble?

56
00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:23.700
What's the matter?
