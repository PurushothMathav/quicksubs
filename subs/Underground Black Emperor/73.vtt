1
00:00:01.266 --> 00:00:02.966
Who dares to make my daughter apologize?

2
00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:05.233
Mom, you are here.

3
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:06.066
aunt

4
00:00:06.066 --> 00:00:08.666
You came just in time, they're choreographing me

5
00:00:08.666 --> 00:00:10.866
Uncle just said

6
00:00:10.933 --> 00:00:11.400
Say what?

7
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.233
The four presidents were captured by Lord Tiger and the others

8
00:00:14.733 --> 00:00:16.200
I want to make a phone call.

9
00:00:16.533 --> 00:00:17.700
But can't get through

10
00:00:19.466 --> 00:00:23.600
Trash is so impatient and still wants to chase my daughter

11
00:00:24.366 --> 00:00:25.266
aunt

12
00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:27.166
Tomorrow

13
00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:30.866
The Heaven and Earth Alliance is going to hold a new alliance chief meeting

14
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:34.600
The four presidents are busy preparing

15
00:00:34.666 --> 00:00:37.300
Isn't it normal to get through?

16
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:38.666
Oh, that's right.

17
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.833
How could I have forgotten something so important?

18
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.966
But it's Dad's phone that can get through?

19
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.800
Your dad hurts you

20
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.300
To celebrate your birthday

21
00:00:48.566 --> 00:00:50.066
Heading back

22
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.966
Even if it is the Alliance Leader Conference

23
00:00:52.966 --> 00:00:54.266
In his heart

24
00:00:54.266 --> 00:00:56.300
It's not as important as the baby girl

25
00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:57.866
I knew it.

26
00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:59.866
I was almost intimidated by you guys

27
00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.100
We really didn't bluff you.

28
00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:02.900
shut up

29
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.766
Robbed my venue first today

30
00:01:05.766 --> 00:01:08.566
He also arranged for my father and the other three chairpeople

31
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.166
I won't give you some color today.

32
00:01:11.166 --> 00:01:13.966
Do you really not think of me as the princess of the Suzaku Club?

33
00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.366
What about the princess?

34
00:01:15.366 --> 00:01:17.333
Your dad's Suzaku Club is about to disband, right?

35
00:01:17.333 --> 00:01:18.933
Where's the little bitch

36
00:01:18.933 --> 00:01:20.966
How dare you choreograph our Suzaku Club like this

37
00:01:20.966 --> 00:01:21.766
Come

38
00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.400
Give me a torn mouth

39
00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.800
Throw the Broad House down from upstairs

40
00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:27.600
Yes

41
00:01:28.466 --> 00:01:30.300
Happy birthday, Miss Zhenzhen

42
00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.566
The gift my dad gave me has arrived
