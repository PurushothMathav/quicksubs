00:00:03.266 --> 00:00:05.766
If you want to wear the crown, you must bear its weight

2
00:00:05.933 --> 00:00:07.000
Excuse me.

3
00:00:07.266 --> 00:00:10.466
It seems that you can't bear the weight of this crown.

4
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:12.366
Cripple

5
00:00:12.533 --> 00:00:15.833
What to wear and what to bring depends on whether you match it or not

6
00:00:16.166 --> 00:00:18.033
You're a cripple with a limp

7
00:00:18.466 --> 00:00:20.166
Are you wearing a crown?

8
00:00:21.166 --> 00:00:23.033
Don't think your name is Zhenzhen too

9
00:00:23.366 --> 00:00:25.633
Do you really consider yourself a princess?

10
00:00:26.133 --> 00:00:30.066
Four Cripples, before I get angry

11
00:00:30.366 --> 00:00:33.000
Get out of here, you're going too far

12
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.766
This is obviously for real

13
00:00:34.766 --> 00:00:35.933
Why are you driving us away?

14
00:00:35.933 --> 00:00:38.866
Just because his dad is a trash who runs a food stall

15
00:00:38.866 --> 00:00:40.866
What if you report to a rich woman?

16
00:00:40.866 --> 00:00:43.666
It doesn't deserve to be in this banquet hall for a birthday

17
00:00:43.866 --> 00:00:47.700
That's right, only people like us Miss Red

18
00:00:47.733 --> 00:00:50.400
Only worthy of this Yunzhou first five-line hall

19
00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:54.800
Don't think you can pretend to be me by calling Zhenzhen too

20
00:00:54.966 --> 00:00:56.100
A sparrow is a sparrow

21
00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.633
Never become a phoenix

22
00:00:57.766 --> 00:01:00.366
Dead cripple like you

23
00:01:00.533 --> 00:01:03.333
Go to that food stall on your birthday

24
00:01:03.333 --> 00:01:05.133
Just eat egg fried rice

25
00:01:05.133 --> 00:01:06.600
What have you been here for?

26
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.166
Do you deserve it?

27
00:01:08.366 --> 00:01:10.200
And add two more eggs to him

28
00:01:10.466 --> 00:01:12.000
Haha, after all

29
00:01:12.133 --> 00:01:14.833
You need a snack on your birthday

30
00:01:15.333 --> 00:01:16.966
You're going too far.

31
00:01:17.533 --> 00:01:18.666
excessive

32
00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.600
You pretended to be me and entered this five-star hall

33
00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.866
Took my present and moved my cake

34
00:01:23.866 --> 00:01:25.466
Dare to say I'm too much

35
00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.833
If I don't give you some color today, see

36
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.366
Do you look down on me?

37
00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:32.666
Dumin

38
00:01:33.566 --> 00:01:34.066
So what's up?

39
00:01:34.066 --> 00:01:37.333
Miss Hong held him down for me

40
00:01:37.333 --> 00:01:39.900
I'm going to take his other leg too

41
00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.433
Let him never jump in front of me in the future
