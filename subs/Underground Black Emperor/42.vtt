00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:03.266
Zhenzhen, you are so heartless.

2
00:00:03.266 --> 00:00:04.866
How can you say that about your mother?

3
00:00:04.866 --> 00:00:06.400
What did I do?

4
00:00:06.566 --> 00:00:10.233
You have everything to eat and live for now

5
00:00:10.466 --> 00:00:13.266
Everything you have, a comfortable life

6
00:00:13.266 --> 00:00:15.066
Didn't I give it to you?

7
00:00:15.066 --> 00:00:16.600
What did you say I did?

8
00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:19.466
You give me this, do I really need this?

9
00:00:20.166 --> 00:00:22.166
Did you ever really try to care about me?

10
00:00:22.666 --> 00:00:25.066
You know, in front of your daughter

11
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:26.900
To reprimand his father

12
00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:28.833
How did he feel?

13
00:00:29.066 --> 00:00:30.500
Have you ever understood

14
00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.566
You don't even know that I have a boyfriend

15
00:00:32.566 --> 00:00:33.800
You don't even know

16
00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.833
You never cared about me at all

17
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.900
It's really not like this, really

18
00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.033
Dad, let's go

19
00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.933
If he wants you to keep trusting this guy

20
00:00:46.933 --> 00:00:48.833
Just make him believe it. Let's go

21
00:00:50.266 --> 00:00:51.200
Wei Wei, are you alright?

22
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.866
Weiwei mother

23
00:00:53.866 --> 00:00:54.800
What's your trouble?

24
00:00:55.133 --> 00:00:55.366
Mom?

25
00:00:55.366 --> 00:00:59.066
I didn't expect what my mother said to hurt you

26
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.266
I didn't mean to say I like to be angry with you.

27
00:01:01.466 --> 00:01:02.800
I'm taking you to the hospital now

28
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.066
It's okay, mom keeps the medicine

29
00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:06.566
Just take a break.

30
00:01:06.566 --> 00:01:07.366
OK

31
00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.466
I'll take you home now.

32
00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.900
Let's go

33
00:01:15.266 --> 00:01:17.366
This girl looks more and more like me

34
00:01:17.366 --> 00:01:18.766
It really looks like a big sister

35
00:01:19.166 --> 00:01:20.400
What is Hailiang doing here?

36
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.666
Hurry up and drive for big brother

37
00:01:21.666 --> 00:01:22.800
Hurry up

38
00:01:23.766 --> 00:01:25.033
Where are you driving to?

39
00:01:25.166 --> 00:01:27.266
I helped you so much.

40
00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:28.700
How can you thank me?

41
00:01:28.966 --> 00:01:32.200
Tonight you are mine, don't make a fuss

42
00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.633
Who made trouble with you?

43
00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.066
Okay, I have something big to tell you

44
00:01:36.066 --> 00:01:38.466
It's not a big deal here
