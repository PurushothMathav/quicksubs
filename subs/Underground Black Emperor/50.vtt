1
00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:02.000
Wang Xiaoyan

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.900
If you keep your mouth clean, he is missing.

3
00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:07.800
Why don't you let people say it?

4
00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:10.866
Wang Wei doesn't quarrel with him

5
00:00:10.866 --> 00:00:12.500
Let's go

6
00:00:12.533 --> 00:00:13.733
He kicked his nose in the face

7
00:00:13.733 --> 00:00:15.833
You can't be so weak, I won't go

8
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:18.700
Who is that?

9
00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:20.300
He is the best of our classmates

10
00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.266
A very smelly guy

11
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.766
Do you remember that Zhou Yanlong yesterday?

12
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.400
He used to like Zhou Yanlong

13
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.266
But Zhou Yanlong is really good

14
00:00:29.333 --> 00:00:30.633
He has always held a grudge

15
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:31.866
It's okay to cross

16
00:00:31.866 --> 00:00:34.933
Zhou Yanlong, what year are you talking about the old emperor?

17
00:00:34.933 --> 00:00:37.033
I have a boyfriend now

18
00:00:37.166 --> 00:00:40.100
The general manager of this car dealership

19
00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.966
They are young, handsome and rich

20
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.600
Now that's a man.

21
00:00:44.866 --> 00:00:47.200
Wang Xiaoyan, I have broken up with Zhou Yanlong.

22
00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.000
Don't be sarcastic in front of me

23
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.466
I told you

24
00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.366
When did you have such an old man by your side?

25
00:00:53.366 --> 00:00:56.000
Hey, the reason why you broke up

26
00:00:56.166 --> 00:00:57.600
Should not

27
00:00:58.266 --> 00:01:00.200
Did he find out that you are a mistress?

28
00:01:00.333 --> 00:01:01.100
What mistress

29
00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:02.200
What nonsense are you talking about?

30
00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.166
How did I poke your sore spot?

31
00:01:04.166 --> 00:01:07.166
It's your mother who is so strict with you

32
00:01:07.166 --> 00:01:08.800
Although he is rich

33
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.766
But he has always been very strict in management.

34
00:01:10.766 --> 00:01:15.066
And your dad runs a big white stall, right?

35
00:01:15.066 --> 00:01:18.266
Humph, where did you get the money to buy a car here?

36
00:01:19.466 --> 00:01:21.433
Ah, Seo Wan Wan

37
00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.966
Are you also taken care of by this uncle?

38
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.933
Uncle, I said you are a long time old

39
00:01:31.933 --> 00:01:33.866
Also playing with two sisters

40
00:01:33.866 --> 00:01:35.266
Can you stand it?
