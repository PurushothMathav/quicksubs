00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:02.433
So brave

2
00:00:02.533 --> 00:00:04.300
Dare to make trouble on my turf

3
00:00:04.333 --> 00:00:07.100
Master, you are finally here

4
00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:09.200
This kid is making trouble in our car

5
00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.466
Look at my leg. He hit it

6
00:00:12.533 --> 00:00:13.733
So brave

7
00:00:13.733 --> 00:00:15.433
Dare to make trouble on my turf

8
00:00:15.533 --> 00:00:16.700
Yes sir

9
00:00:16.766 --> 00:00:18.500
That's them

10
00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:20.266
They don't say when they swipe other people's cards

11
00:00:20.266 --> 00:00:21.400
You can't get the money.

12
00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:22.700
We question.

13
00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:24.266
How dare they hit people?

14
00:00:24.666 --> 00:00:27.366
You see, it hurt our family

15
00:00:27.366 --> 00:00:28.400
Old swipe

16
00:00:28.766 --> 00:00:30.966
Is it that Linger's black gold card?

17
00:00:30.966 --> 00:00:32.466
Yes, yes, that's the card.

18
00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.500
Master, the owner of that card is

19
00:00:35.533 --> 00:00:37.066
You don't need to ask

20
00:00:37.066 --> 00:00:40.166
Anyway, a big man's big man

21
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.366
I knew he must have stolen it.

22
00:00:42.366 --> 00:00:44.266
He runs a food stall on the side of the road

23
00:00:44.266 --> 00:00:45.966
How can you possibly have the money to buy a car?

24
00:00:47.333 --> 00:00:50.266
Well, it's a food stall, right?

25
00:00:50.533 --> 00:00:52.433
He's my classmate's father.

26
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.333
He runs a food stall

27
00:00:54.333 --> 00:00:56.700
It seemed to be some kind of punk before

28
00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:57.900
Pretty good

29
00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.933
You see, they all hurt us in Darling

30
00:01:00.933 --> 00:01:03.100
That's right, the young master is causing trouble in your car dealership

31
00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:04.266
And broke my leg

32
00:01:04.266 --> 00:01:04.966
Hey sir

33
00:01:04.966 --> 00:01:07.466
This kid doesn't give you face at all.

34
00:01:07.466 --> 00:01:09.800
That's right, young master, get this person out quickly

35
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:10.800
Break his legs

36
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.800
Let him be like his useless daughter

37
00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.400
When you die a cripple all your life

38
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.866
He also has a daughter

39
00:01:16.133 --> 00:01:17.266
Yes, yes, yes, yes!

40
00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.066
A crippled cripple

41
00:01:19.066 --> 00:01:21.200
How dare you insult my daughter like this again

42
00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.166
He'll be in a wheelchair for the rest of his life
