00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.133
He knows that you have cooperated with our Li family

2
00:00:03.133 --> 00:00:04.300
Want to take this

3
00:00:04.466 --> 00:00:05.600
Knock you

4
00:00:07.533 --> 00:00:10.833
Master Zhang, if you really come to borrow money

5
00:00:10.933 --> 00:00:11.866
Tell me

6
00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.900
Li Wei, I'm not short of money

7
00:00:15.066 --> 00:00:17.666
But when did you cooperate with Li's?

8
00:00:17.866 --> 00:00:19.366
Did you encounter any difficulties?

9
00:00:19.366 --> 00:00:20.166
I didn't arrange it before

10
00:00:20.166 --> 00:00:21.466
Arrange what?

11
00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:23.500
Nothing.

12
00:00:23.766 --> 00:00:26.966
You don't want to say you arranged it all, do you?

13
00:00:26.966 --> 00:00:28.833
Ah I tell you

14
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.033
The reason why Weiwei Company has so many partners

15
00:00:32.133 --> 00:00:33.500
All because

16
00:00:33.666 --> 00:00:35.966
Wei Wei's own personal ability is relatively strong

17
00:00:35.966 --> 00:00:38.466
And I also took a fancy to him

18
00:00:38.466 --> 00:00:40.333
Only then did we cooperate in depth with him

19
00:00:40.333 --> 00:00:41.300
You?

20
00:00:41.666 --> 00:00:43.866
Do you really think you are a big shot?

21
00:00:43.866 --> 00:00:45.466
Am I a big shot?

22
00:00:45.766 --> 00:00:48.066
It has nothing to do with you.

23
00:00:48.333 --> 00:00:50.066
Really put it up for me here

24
00:00:50.133 --> 00:00:51.833
Ok Mr. Zhang

25
00:00:51.933 --> 00:00:54.100
If you really want to borrow money, I can lend it to you.

26
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:55.600
But

27
00:00:56.466 --> 00:00:57.666
Only this time

28
00:00:57.766 --> 00:00:58.500
This is not an example.

29
00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.066
I'm really not short of money

30
00:01:00.066 --> 00:01:01.200
I'm here.

31
00:01:01.733 --> 00:01:03.933
I'm here to give my daughter a birthday present

32
00:01:03.933 --> 00:01:05.100
I'll leave after delivery

33
00:01:05.166 --> 00:01:06.200
She's not home.

34
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:07.766
Hanging out with friends

35
00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.400
Hey okay

36
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.500
Then I'll come back tomorrow.

37
00:01:14.566 --> 00:01:15.666
Wait a minute.

38
00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:17.100
slightly

39
00:01:17.766 --> 00:01:19.833
I know our family really likes Liu Ting

40
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
That ticket VIP

41
00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:26.700
Money can't buy it

42
00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.200
Thank you, Zhenzhen

43
00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.200
Sure will love this gift.

44
00:01:32.333 --> 00:01:34.633
Huh what's this

45
00:01:36.666 --> 00:01:38.300
I'd like to see it

46
00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.433
A father who is not short of money and wants to make amends

47
00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.666
To the daughter you made disabled

48
00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:47.100
What kind of rituals have you prepared?

49
00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.233
courting death Zhangye

50
00:01:48.666 --> 00:01:50.033
What do you want?

51
00:01:51.766 --> 00:01:54.000
Just a few concert tickets

52
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.600
What's there to be proud of?

53
00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.100
Do you want to see gifts?

54
00:01:58.266 --> 00:02:00.400
This is Liu Tianhou's private watch.

55
00:02:00.666 --> 00:02:02.566
Zhenzhen will love it

56
00:02:04.766 --> 00:02:05.866
Just this watch

57
00:02:06.066 --> 00:02:09.866
Do you think Liu Tianhou would hide such a bad watch?

58
00:02:09.866 --> 00:02:13.233
Which trash heap did you pick it up from?

59
00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:16.200
