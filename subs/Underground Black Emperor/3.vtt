00:00:00.966 --> 00:00:02.100
Get up here

2
00:00:03.466 --> 00:00:04.600
big brother

3
00:00:05.266 --> 00:00:05.933
Humph

4
00:00:05.933 --> 00:00:09.166
This is not Tiger Lord, are you mistaken?

5
00:00:09.166 --> 00:00:10.800
He runs a food stall.

6
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.966
How can you call him big brother? You dare to talk nonsense

7
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.966
I'm not your big brother anymore, big brother.

8
00:00:17.066 --> 00:00:19.800
You will always be my big brother in my Wang Xiaowu heart

9
00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:23.133
After you washed your hands in a golden basin

10
00:00:23.133 --> 00:00:24.633
Heaven and Earth Alliance leaderless

11
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.466
Those guys with bad intentions

12
00:00:26.466 --> 00:00:28.000
Want to hold an alliance meeting

13
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.233
usurpation

14
00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.066
But in my heart, Wang Xiaohu

15
00:00:31.066 --> 00:00:32.366
Only you, big brother.

16
00:00:32.366 --> 00:00:34.100
Brother, as long as you understand

17
00:00:34.533 --> 00:00:36.066
I will immediately tell the rivers and lakes

18
00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.666
Return to your door

19
00:00:37.733 --> 00:00:39.233
I'm not in the rivers and lakes now

20
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.966
I don't want to worry about your business either.

21
00:00:41.133 --> 00:00:43.133
But your men are too unruly

22
00:00:43.133 --> 00:00:43.900
blatant blackmail

23
00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:44.866
The sky is falling

24
00:00:45.533 --> 00:00:47.033
What did I teach you before?

25
00:00:47.066 --> 00:00:49.766
Big brother is a tiger with no discipline

26
00:00:50.966 --> 00:00:53.400
I must make rules for them.

27
00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.800
Nonsense. I was wrong. Nonsense spared me

28
00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:58.500
Send them back to serve the ghosts

29
00:00:59.333 --> 00:01:01.200
Nonsense we were wrong nonsense

30
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.566
Nonsense spare me

31
00:01:02.566 --> 00:01:03.566
Pardon my nonsense

32
00:01:03.566 --> 00:01:04.366
nonsense

33
00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:07.033
Brother, what else do you want?

34
00:01:07.666 --> 00:01:09.100
Go wash the dishes

35
00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:09.933
Clean the floor too

36
00:01:09.933 --> 00:01:10.733
Give it

37
00:01:11.766 --> 00:01:13.400
Oops work

38
00:01:14.533 --> 00:01:16.400
Boy, big brother

39
00:01:20.066 --> 00:01:21.933
I remember you used to cook, right?

40
00:01:21.933 --> 00:01:23.000
I was a spoon, right?

41
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.066
I help me continue to entertain guests here

42
00:01:25.066 --> 00:01:25.966
I'm going out

43
00:01:25.966 --> 00:01:26.766
Give it

44
00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.066
Hey, it's not big brother.

45
00:01:29.666 --> 00:01:31.600
Um, where is this going?

46
00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.000
My daughter's birthday is tomorrow.

47
00:01:33.266 --> 00:01:35.400
I'm going to give him a birthday present.

48
00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.633
My fried noodles
