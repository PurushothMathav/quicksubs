00:00:00.566 --> 00:00:02.333
You ignorant dog thing

2
00:00:02.333 --> 00:00:03.700
How dare you disrespect big brother

3
00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:05.866
Somebody drag him out for me

4
00:00:05.866 --> 00:00:07.000
Resigned him

5
00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:08.133
quarreled with him

6
00:00:08.133 --> 00:00:10.200
Drive out of Yunzhou again

7
00:00:11.766 --> 00:00:12.466
Young master

8
00:00:12.466 --> 00:00:14.533
I was wrong, I was wrong, bro

9
00:00:14.533 --> 00:00:16.466
I was wrong. Um, cut me some slack

10
00:00:16.866 --> 00:00:19.066
Let me go, as for you

11
00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.166
Really, really, really, I know I'm wrong.

12
00:00:21.166 --> 00:00:23.333
Yes, it's me, it's my fault recently.

13
00:00:23.333 --> 00:00:25.266
Yes yes yes I remember you

14
00:00:25.533 --> 00:00:26.600
Please let me go

15
00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.133
Give me a break, Jane.

16
00:00:28.133 --> 00:00:29.800
Can't you be soft this time?

17
00:00:29.966 --> 00:00:32.300
Do you remember how he taunted you and scolded you?

18
00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:34.866
Ah, he blocked you in the toilet several times.

19
00:00:35.333 --> 00:00:37.933
And this is the matter, is the uncle his best friend?

20
00:00:37.933 --> 00:00:39.333
It is said that the family is also on the road

21
00:00:39.333 --> 00:00:40.466
The experienced kind

22
00:00:40.466 --> 00:00:41.266
Him and his girlfriend?

23
00:00:41.266 --> 00:00:43.133
Just bully the real thing often.

24
00:00:43.133 --> 00:00:46.000
Why didn't you tell me this before?

25
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.233
I don't think so.

26
00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.100
How can it be as serious as it is often said?

27
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.766
It's just a small conflict between classmates

28
00:00:52.766 --> 00:00:54.433
Where is this little contradiction?

29
00:00:55.133 --> 00:00:57.366
Dad today is my birthday

30
00:00:57.366 --> 00:00:59.266
Are we having fun?

31
00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.100
Why do you call and call to affect everyone's mood?

32
00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.300
Let him go

33
00:01:03.366 --> 00:01:04.433
I believe

34
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.866
He will never trouble me again

35
00:01:06.866 --> 00:01:08.966
Yes, yes, I will never dare again

36
00:01:08.966 --> 00:01:11.800
I will hide far away when I see you in the future

37
00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.300
I beg you to let me go

38
00:01:14.466 --> 00:01:15.600
Cripple

39
00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.466
You wait for me to find my best friend, his father is also a gangster boss

40
00:01:18.466 --> 00:01:20.800
I'll make sure you look good then.
