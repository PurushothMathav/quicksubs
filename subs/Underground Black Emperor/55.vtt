00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.400
Security took them to me

2
00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:04.500
What are you doing?

3
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.000
That's how a manager treats customers.

4
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.566
Hahaha customer

5
00:00:08.566 --> 00:00:10.900
Of course we treat customers warmly.

6
00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:13.666
But for trash poor people like you

7
00:00:13.666 --> 00:00:14.933
It was heartless.

8
00:00:14.933 --> 00:00:16.166
Just because of his words

9
00:00:16.166 --> 00:00:18.400
You just don't think we can afford that car, do you?

10
00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.233
I've seen a lot of people like you

11
00:00:20.333 --> 00:00:22.933
Come to my car dealership and pretend to be rich, right?

12
00:00:22.933 --> 00:00:26.300
Why are you bringing your daughter here to act tough?

13
00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.733
Hahaha, how do you know we can't afford it?

14
00:00:28.733 --> 00:00:30.033
Can you afford that?

15
00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:31.400
Our car dealership

16
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.666
Any one starts at two or three million

17
00:00:33.733 --> 00:00:35.800
Just because your dad changed dads

18
00:00:35.966 --> 00:00:39.500
I'm afraid he can't even afford one after ten years of cooking

19
00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.733
Somebody catch them

20
00:00:41.733 --> 00:00:44.500
Take it down and treat the brothers well

21
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.466
I see you want to die

22
00:00:47.066 --> 00:00:48.766
How dare you threaten me?

23
00:00:48.766 --> 00:00:50.133
If they don't cooperate

24
00:00:50.133 --> 00:00:52.133
I'll strip them naked now

25
00:00:52.133 --> 00:00:54.066
Then I'll kill him now

26
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.566
Don't do it, I'll do it

27
00:00:56.566 --> 00:00:58.766
If we could really afford this car

28
00:00:58.800 --> 00:00:59.800
What would you say?

29
00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.400
How can you possibly afford that?

30
00:01:02.566 --> 00:01:06.133
You don't want your mom to pay for it, do you?

31
00:01:06.133 --> 00:01:07.466
Ah no my mom

32
00:01:07.533 --> 00:01:09.066
Don't you always say

33
00:01:09.133 --> 00:01:11.600
Is my dad a punk who runs a food stall?

34
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.366
Keep using this to suppress and laugh at me

35
00:01:13.366 --> 00:01:15.600
Now I'll tell my dad

36
00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.566
The best and greatest dad in the world

37
00:01:18.933 --> 00:01:19.733
Credit.
