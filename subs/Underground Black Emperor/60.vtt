00:00:00.966 --> 00:00:03.166
How dare you two insult my daughter like this again

2
00:00:03.166 --> 00:00:05.100
He'll be in a wheelchair for the rest of his life

3
00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:06.700
How dare you!

4
00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:08.966
Master Beast is here, how dare you be so presumptuous

5
00:00:08.966 --> 00:00:09.800
Come on, come on.

6
00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:11.200
Aren't you very good at fighting?

7
00:00:11.266 --> 00:00:12.666
Hit me if you can

8
00:00:12.666 --> 00:00:14.466
I think you can be the face of the beast master

9
00:00:14.666 --> 00:00:17.200
Break my legs if you can.

10
00:00:20.733 --> 00:00:22.100
You are the devil

11
00:00:22.666 --> 00:00:25.833
I see you look a little familiar

12
00:00:26.066 --> 00:00:28.066
Don't get close to us, Lord Beast

13
00:00:28.366 --> 00:00:32.066
Should you say in your next sentence that you know Master Beast?

14
00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.266
I asked to get acquainted when I was drinking before

15
00:00:35.266 --> 00:00:38.666
Hmph, I want to ask the beast master to let you go, hahaha.

16
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.100
No.

17
00:00:40.166 --> 00:00:42.866
I remember you were there at KTV yesterday

18
00:00:42.866 --> 00:00:44.966
You even cleaned my food stall

19
00:00:44.966 --> 00:00:46.900
Presumptuous, do you know what you're talking about?

20
00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:49.433
Little cripple, is your father crazy?

21
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.566
He also dared to say that the young master worked in his food stall

22
00:00:53.566 --> 00:00:54.366
Why didn't he say it?

23
00:00:54.366 --> 00:00:56.066
Master Tiger is also working in his food stall.

24
00:00:56.066 --> 00:00:57.533
You were right.

25
00:00:57.533 --> 00:00:59.666
Tiger did cook at my dad's place before

26
00:00:59.666 --> 00:01:01.966
I heard the craftsmanship is not bad, it's really good

27
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.766
Before, your Uncle Tiger was a chef in a hotel

28
00:01:04.766 --> 00:01:07.266
Crazy, even our Tiger Lord dares to choreograph

29
00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.700
Young Master, this person is simply a great compliment to you.

30
00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.300
Even Lord Tiger dares to choreograph

31
00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:14.066
The young master also asked you to kill him

32
00:01:14.066 --> 00:01:16.400
You asked me to kill him

33
00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.266
Of course sir

34
00:01:18.366 --> 00:01:20.066
He even dares to choreograph

35
00:01:20.133 --> 00:01:23.066
This is an insult to our Heaven and Earth Alliance

36
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.100
Ah, what the hell are you?

37
00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.833
Dare to say that our Heaven and Earth Alliance
