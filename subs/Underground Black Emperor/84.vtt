00:00:00.933 --> 00:00:02.900
Mahan, what are you doing here?

2
00:00:02.933 --> 00:00:04.600
I'm afraid it will come again later.

3
00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:07.466
You should call that fox your mother

4
00:00:07.466 --> 00:00:11.233
No, it's my dad's birthday party for me.

5
00:00:11.266 --> 00:00:13.800
Your dad and that fox are throwing you a birthday party

6
00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:15.400
You hide it from your mother

7
00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.066
How could I have a daughter like you?

8
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.900
You and big brother have divorced

9
00:00:19.266 --> 00:00:21.866
Is there anything unreasonable about not informing you?

10
00:00:21.866 --> 00:00:24.400
Do you think I care if he doesn't get through to me?

11
00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:25.466
I care

12
00:00:25.466 --> 00:00:27.533
He's really, really safe with me

13
00:00:27.533 --> 00:00:28.833
Don't worry about that.

14
00:00:29.133 --> 00:00:31.300
Security. How do you think I found this?

15
00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:32.733
I was just downstairs.

16
00:00:32.733 --> 00:00:34.900
I saw Hong Daying with a group of people holding

17
00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:35.933
Axe boy

18
00:00:35.933 --> 00:00:37.900
Rush up, you call it safety

19
00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:39.666
Hong Daying has been taken care of by us

20
00:00:39.666 --> 00:00:40.533
So what?

21
00:00:40.533 --> 00:00:42.366
As long as I'm really with you

22
00:00:42.466 --> 00:00:43.766
Will be in danger

23
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.233
Do you know how scared I was?

24
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:47.066
You know

25
00:00:47.066 --> 00:00:49.333
Do you know how scared I was that he would get hurt again?

26
00:00:49.333 --> 00:00:51.500
It's true that I didn't protect Zhenzhen well before.

27
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.866
I promise there won't be a next time

28
00:00:53.866 --> 00:00:55.700
You promised that last time.

29
00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:56.900
He has real legs

30
00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:58.733
Really real legs, I have already sent someone to find medicine

31
00:00:58.733 --> 00:01:00.500
I believe there will be news soon.

32
00:01:00.533 --> 00:01:02.766
Mom doesn't blame Dad this time

33
00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:04.700
It's that Hong Daying, shut up

34
00:01:04.733 --> 00:01:06.600
Will this happen if you don't come here today?

35
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.800
Hey, it's not that it's pointless for you to say that

36
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.233
It was an accident.

37
00:01:10.366 --> 00:01:12.533
Are you going to lock Miss Zhenzhen at home?

38
00:01:12.533 --> 00:01:13.533
For a lifetime?

39
00:01:13.533 --> 00:01:15.100
To ensure her safety

40
00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:16.366
Why not close it for a lifetime?
