00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:02.100
Gambling Saint

2
00:00:02.566 --> 00:00:05.466
Are you going to violate Covenant 36?

3
00:00:05.466 --> 00:00:07.600
Shitty Covenant 36

4
00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:10.566
Wang Xiaohu, we join the Heaven and Earth Alliance

5
00:00:10.566 --> 00:00:12.400
Not for you to use these rules

6
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:13.966
Applied to us

7
00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:16.000
Rules are rules

8
00:00:16.133 --> 00:00:18.066
No matter who violates the covenant

9
00:00:18.966 --> 00:00:20.300
Will be dealt with

10
00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.166
Bullshit our four gangs

11
00:00:23.166 --> 00:00:25.466
How carefree it was

12
00:00:25.533 --> 00:00:29.266
I wanted to enjoy the shade under the big tree

13
00:00:29.266 --> 00:00:31.000
Only then did he join the Heaven and Earth Alliance

14
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:32.766
Who would have thought

15
00:00:32.766 --> 00:00:35.766
He put a set of shackles around his neck

16
00:00:35.766 --> 00:00:36.766
Exactly.

17
00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.600
You just have to deal with outsiders with these rules

18
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.700
But now you're treating us irritants

19
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:45.500
Humph

20
00:00:45.966 --> 00:00:48.300
This Heaven and Earth Alliance is not waiting

21
00:00:48.866 --> 00:00:54.166
So you're going to violate Covenant 36, right?

22
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.733
Our four major gangs come and go as they please

23
00:00:57.733 --> 00:01:00.600
Why do you still want to force us to stay?

24
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.800
Where did you put my heaven and earth alliance?

25
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:05.066
Tiger Lord

26
00:01:05.766 --> 00:01:08.700
The reason why the four of us can join the heaven and earth collapse

27
00:01:09.133 --> 00:01:11.733
That's because I respect you as a person.

28
00:01:11.733 --> 00:01:14.366
But now you're favoring this guy

29
00:01:14.366 --> 00:01:15.966
We can't accept it.

30
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.866
Obviously you made a mistake

31
00:01:18.533 --> 00:01:20.300
How did I become biased?

32
00:01:21.066 --> 00:01:22.233
It's useless to talk too much

33
00:01:23.133 --> 00:01:26.700
Tiger Lord, I will call you Tiger Lord one last time

34
00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.100
You think clearly

35
00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.333
Are you going because of this guy?

36
00:01:30.333 --> 00:01:32.666
To turn against our four major gangs

37
00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.766
So you want to

38
00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.200
United

39
00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.633
Rebellion, that's right

40
00:01:42.666 --> 00:01:44.566
We're going the other way around.

41
00:01:44.566 --> 00:01:47.166
Don't you see?

42
00:01:47.166 --> 00:01:50.266
He, Wang Xiaohu, is simply playing on the topic

43
00:01:50.333 --> 00:01:52.866
It's a lie that he helped this person out

44
00:01:52.866 --> 00:01:57.166
It's true that he hit our four major gangs
