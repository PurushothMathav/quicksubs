00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:03.133
Really true, people like him

2
00:00:03.133 --> 00:00:05.166
Can make small conflicts kill people

3
00:00:05.166 --> 00:00:07.200
Even you and your mother were almost implicated

4
00:00:07.333 --> 00:00:08.566
People like him

5
00:00:09.066 --> 00:00:12.100
Don't you understand whether you deserve to be a woman or not?

6
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.700
Who the hell didn't understand?

7
00:00:15.366 --> 00:00:18.466
Mom, you've been prejudiced against Dad all these years

8
00:00:18.466 --> 00:00:20.766
You'd rather believe this big talker

9
00:00:20.766 --> 00:00:22.933
I never tried to trust my father

10
00:00:22.933 --> 00:00:23.733
Zhenzhen

11
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.500
What are you saying?

12
00:00:26.133 --> 00:00:27.366
Have you been deceived too?

13
00:00:27.366 --> 00:00:29.366
Think about how your leg is disabled.

14
00:00:29.366 --> 00:00:30.866
How did my leg become disabled?

15
00:00:30.866 --> 00:00:32.166
I know better than you

16
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.666
I know better than you

17
00:00:34.666 --> 00:00:36.466
I know better than any of you.

18
00:00:36.466 --> 00:00:38.633
If it weren't for the fact that Dad killed the siege

19
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.400
Carry me away

20
00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.166
I'm already dead

21
00:00:42.733 --> 00:00:44.666
You saw the scar on Dad's body

22
00:00:44.666 --> 00:00:46.266
Where did these scars come from?

23
00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.033
It's for me.

24
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.466
You always ask what dad did for this family

25
00:00:51.466 --> 00:00:52.833
What have you paid?

26
00:00:52.866 --> 00:00:54.666
He sacrificed his life

27
00:00:54.866 --> 00:00:57.800
What about you? What have you done?
