00:00:00.466 --> 00:00:03.066
Mom, what do you think?

2
00:00:03.166 --> 00:00:05.966
President Nalan's brain is not good

3
00:00:05.966 --> 00:00:07.000
This project

4
00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:09.866
Not only our Lin's Group raised 100 billion yuan

5
00:00:09.866 --> 00:00:12.300
So is the Mid-Zhou Chamber of Commerce

6
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.266
If he is only worth ten billion projects

7
00:00:14.333 --> 00:00:15.200
What do you think?

8
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:18.766
Will the Zhongzhou Chamber of Commerce increase the investment amount simultaneously?

9
00:00:18.766 --> 00:00:20.900
Fan'er, what do you say?

10
00:00:22.366 --> 00:00:23.700
What do you mean?

11
00:00:23.766 --> 00:00:26.866
Although Zizi was stubborn and useless before

12
00:00:26.866 --> 00:00:29.700
But it's really changed a lot lately

13
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:33.400
He must have meant something else.

14
00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.200
Because of new energy projects

15
00:00:35.466 --> 00:00:38.700
It will become the first key project of Middle School

16
00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:42.766
The capital will invade and provide unlimited support

17
00:00:45.933 --> 00:00:49.133
Where did you get this news from?

18
00:00:49.133 --> 00:00:52.400
Is it accurate? President Nalan told me himself

19
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.300
Do you think it will be fake?

20
00:00:55.133 --> 00:00:58.766
If it is true

21
00:00:58.933 --> 00:01:01.900
That's really an opportunity.

22
00:01:02.333 --> 00:01:04.866
It's really an opportunity

23
00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.166
But increase the investment by 10 times

24
00:01:07.166 --> 00:01:09.866
The expansion of the project continues throughout the industry

25
00:01:09.866 --> 00:01:11.966
Still too aggressive

26
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:13.966
I agree with Lin Dong

27
00:01:13.966 --> 00:01:15.200
Is this business?

28
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.366
The emphasis is on steady play

29
00:01:17.366 --> 00:01:20.700
I, Lin's Group, can have today's achievements and status

30
00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.233
It depends on one word, roll

31
00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:25.300
Hahaha Second Aunt

32
00:01:25.466 --> 00:01:27.500
The situation of our Lin's Group

33
00:01:27.566 --> 00:01:30.766
100 billion projects can't be eaten at all

34
00:01:31.333 --> 00:01:33.933
I acknowledge your relationship with President Nalan

35
00:01:33.933 --> 00:01:35.700
Extraordinary, perhaps.

36
00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:36.766
But even so

37
00:01:36.766 --> 00:01:38.200
I don't think it's far from there yet.

38
00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.200
President Nalan will reveal to you

39
00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.200
The state of this major secret

40
00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:43.500
Shu Sheng is right

41
00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:44.700
Do you have any evidence?

42
00:01:45.466 --> 00:01:46.366
Then why not?

43
00:01:46.866 --> 00:01:50.433
I'll come down to you in person at the meeting

44
00:01:50.766 --> 00:01:51.633
face to face

45
00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.300
Lin Fan, what if your news is true?

46
00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:59.366
With this alone

47
00:01:59.366 --> 00:02:01.666
Can't support a hundred billion-dollar investment

48
00:02:01.666 --> 00:02:03.600
This obvious loss-making business

49
00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:05.000
Stupid
