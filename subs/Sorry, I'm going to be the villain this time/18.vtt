00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:01.133
Ah!

2
00:00:01.966 --> 00:00:05.966
Lin Wen, you are actually in front of the elders who formed the team

3
00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:07.500
Popular Hero

4
00:00:07.733 --> 00:00:10.266
The future of the enemy group will be handed over to you

5
00:00:10.266 --> 00:00:11.400
I will definitely walk.

6
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:12.200
you

7
00:00:12.966 --> 00:00:15.500
It's because your family builds nests

8
00:00:15.766 --> 00:00:20.300
That's why I have been withdrawn everywhere in the past few years

9
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.466
Uh-huh.

10
00:00:24.866 --> 00:00:26.433
I am in charge of Lin's

11
00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:28.400
The first thing I do

12
00:00:29.166 --> 00:00:31.966
It's just to cut your dividends for trash

13
00:00:32.766 --> 00:00:33.633
Ah!

14
00:00:34.333 --> 00:00:37.300
Get moving

15
00:00:38.566 --> 00:00:40.800
Hahaha, when a temporary 10 billion investment

16
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.766
It's just a big level of tens of billions of funds

17
00:00:42.766 --> 00:00:45.133
You also have occasional temporary relatives in public

18
00:00:45.133 --> 00:00:46.300
Do you still have me in your eyes?

19
00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:49.666
Temporary clansmen still have no mother, hurry up

20
00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:53.300
Ah you bastard

21
00:00:53.333 --> 00:00:56.233
Dare to fantasize about this knowledge?

22
00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:59.466
Court death and I will fulfill you

23
00:00:59.466 --> 00:01:00.866
And you

24
00:01:01.066 --> 00:01:04.000
Remember what I said one by one

25
00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:05.633
Want filial piety

26
00:01:06.166 --> 00:01:08.500
Kneel down and beg me

27
00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.266
Lin Fan was rampant

28
00:01:11.266 --> 00:01:13.166
The item you got was lost because of you.

29
00:01:13.166 --> 00:01:17.000
How dare you make Chu Sheng and all the uncles kneel for you

30
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.666
I think you are acting too much

31
00:01:18.666 --> 00:01:20.233
Are you blocking yourself?

32
00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.566
As long as I kneel down for you, I can get the contract back, right?

33
00:01:23.566 --> 00:01:26.666
OK as long as you can get the contract back

34
00:01:26.666 --> 00:01:28.166
I kneel down immediately

35
00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.300
The Lord is right

36
00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.300
As long as you can get the project back

37
00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:35.500
What's the harm in kneeling down for you?

38
00:01:37.166 --> 00:01:38.000
instead

39
00:01:39.066 --> 00:01:41.566
When are you going to fool around?

40
00:01:42.466 --> 00:01:43.700
Break up the contract

41
00:01:43.866 --> 00:01:46.400
Exactly as Mr. Lin said

42
00:01:46.766 --> 00:01:51.300
After all, I came here specially for Mr. Lin

43
00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.266
Send the contract

44
00:01:53.533 --> 00:01:55.233
But now it seems

45
00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:56.833
No need.

46
00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.466
Of course, if you still want to

47
00:01:59.466 --> 00:02:02.166
If you continue to cooperate with the Zhongzhou Chamber of Commerce

48
00:02:02.333 --> 00:02:05.766
It depends on whether you can get it.

49
00:02:05.933 --> 00:02:08.000
Mr. Lin's forgiveness
