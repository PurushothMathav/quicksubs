00:00:00.666 --> 00:00:04.666
Have you read all the official documents of Fan'er Zhongshu?

2
00:00:05.866 --> 00:00:07.966
A clear document with a Chinese script

3
00:00:07.966 --> 00:00:11.300
The future of this project is beyond doubt

4
00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:12.700
It turns out

5
00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:16.000
The planning and upgrade of the whole industry chain you made

6
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.033
Is the most correct choice

7
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.800
It is the investment of tens of billions of project funds

8
00:00:22.866 --> 00:00:26.600
That's 40 billion cash flow

9
00:00:26.766 --> 00:00:30.466
Even with all the company's liquidity

10
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.766
Can't fill the gap

11
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.400
Money problem

12
00:00:34.766 --> 00:00:36.700
I have already solved it

13
00:00:37.533 --> 00:00:38.600
Pardon me?

14
00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:43.633
Look carefully

15
00:00:45.166 --> 00:00:48.366
Did you sell the land in Dongshan?

16
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.200
The land is planned for regeneration

17
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.266
The return on investment is continuous over time

18
00:00:53.266 --> 00:00:54.600
How could I do it?

19
00:00:55.266 --> 00:00:56.900
Then this money is

20
00:00:57.366 --> 00:01:00.800
I just found some people to invest in it

21
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.200
Your investors each invest 20 billion

22
00:01:05.366 --> 00:01:09.000
10% of the shares, you haven't started the project yet.

23
00:01:09.166 --> 00:01:11.066
Make a hundred billion

24
00:01:13.466 --> 00:01:14.900
According to the mountains

25
00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.400
That's the central guard building behind him.

26
00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.066
We must take back power as soon as possible

27
00:01:20.066 --> 00:01:22.000
Sure enough, it is hard with small wings

28
00:01:22.733 --> 00:01:24.600
I want to deal with him

29
00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.833
I'm afraid it's already powerless

30
00:01:27.866 --> 00:01:29.066
After today

31
00:01:29.066 --> 00:01:33.633
Our Lin's Group will become the largest group in Zhongzhou

32
00:01:33.933 --> 00:01:36.700
Second only to the Zhongzhou Chamber of Commerce

33
00:01:36.733 --> 00:01:39.766
If you look across the building.

34
00:01:39.933 --> 00:01:41.900
The most powerful consortium

35
00:01:43.366 --> 00:01:46.566
Fan'er, you did this project by hand.

36
00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.533
When the project is completed

37
00:01:48.533 --> 00:01:50.433
Invite midstate celebrities

38
00:01:50.466 --> 00:01:54.666
Held an unprecedented celebration party

39
00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:00.700
Then I want you to die without a burial place

40
00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:05.066
This time

41
00:02:05.166 --> 00:02:08.166
I must have a good experience with Song Lan

42
00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.166
The taste of falling from the clouds

43
00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.200
Song Lan thought he was strategizing

44
00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:13.833
Everything is under control

45
00:02:13.866 --> 00:02:16.266
But how do you know your husband's ability?

46
00:02:19.533 --> 00:02:22.166
I don't know if I should say something.

47
00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.066
Between you and me

48
00:02:25.366 --> 00:02:27.366
Is there anything else you can't say?

49
00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.700
Although you are now a temporary

50
00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.066
The largest controlling stake

51
00:02:31.066 --> 00:02:31.866
But he delivered

52
00:02:31.866 --> 00:02:34.433
He still owns only 30% of the company's shares

53
00:02:34.666 --> 00:02:36.300
Then the temporary group made money

54
00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.200
He sent 30% of them.

55
00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:39.866
I won't have a future
