1
00:00:00.466 --> 00:00:03.366
Who said they wanted to remove Mr. Lin?

2
00:00:03.566 --> 00:00:05.366
President Manan is here

3
00:00:05.366 --> 00:00:07.366
There is a loss of welcome

4
00:00:07.366 --> 00:00:08.966
Meet meet

5
00:00:08.966 --> 00:00:10.266
Don't be polite

6
00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:12.800
I'm here this time for the ceremony

7
00:00:13.733 --> 00:00:16.900
Presumably, the project builder will go on a collective strike

8
00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:19.233
You've all heard about it.

9
00:00:20.333 --> 00:00:21.133
Sure enough

10
00:00:21.766 --> 00:00:25.066
The problem with the project alerted President Nalan

11
00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.500
President Nalan

12
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.666
Designate frequent project owners

13
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:31.233
Just two days

14
00:00:31.333 --> 00:00:33.633
The project has such a big problem

15
00:00:35.133 --> 00:00:38.266
I'm afraid it's going to be hard to end

16
00:00:38.366 --> 00:00:40.300
It's all Lin's fault for returning this trash

17
00:00:41.066 --> 00:00:42.266
There we go.

18
00:00:42.266 --> 00:00:44.100
President Nalan is taking back the project

19
00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.966
The whole death will be a heavy loss.

20
00:00:51.166 --> 00:00:52.266
President Nanan

21
00:00:52.333 --> 00:00:53.700
Please rest assured.

22
00:00:53.966 --> 00:00:57.266
This started with my Ming Group

23
00:00:57.333 --> 00:00:59.466
We will definitely solve it properly.

24
00:01:00.166 --> 00:01:02.066
The heads of several urban construction parties who went on strike

25
00:01:02.066 --> 00:01:04.066
I have been invited by the governor to drink tea

26
00:01:04.066 --> 00:01:05.000
They make trouble

27
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.666
There is no such thing as project arrears

28
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.200
It's just intentional

29
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.666
What is who?

30
00:01:13.666 --> 00:01:14.766
How dare you do this to me?

31
00:01:14.766 --> 00:01:15.766
Temporary encouragement

32
00:01:16.266 --> 00:01:18.700
The people behind the scenes will soon find out

33
00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.400
I'm just here to give you a heads-up.

34
00:01:21.766 --> 00:01:23.300
One week period

35
00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:24.966
Now there are only five days left.

36
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.033
Be sure to ensure that all aspects of this project

37
00:01:28.066 --> 00:01:29.700
All plans are implemented

38
00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.466
No flickering.
