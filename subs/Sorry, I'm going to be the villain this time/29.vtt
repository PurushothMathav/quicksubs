1
00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.033
It starts with doom.

2
00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:05.100
Van

3
00:00:05.766 --> 00:00:07.200
This is serious

4
00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:08.300
Exactly.

5
00:00:08.933 --> 00:00:10.366
I want to give it to Lin

6
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:11.933
co-founder heart

7
00:00:11.933 --> 00:00:13.233
Tong Wei Yongheng

8
00:00:13.466 --> 00:00:14.866
Tianda Origin

9
00:00:17.366 --> 00:00:18.866
Can you stop being funny?

10
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.033
Do you know what you are doing?

11
00:00:21.166 --> 00:00:24.200
Unauthorized increase in investment angered Nalan venue

12
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.800
All ex-wife investments in the entire group

13
00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:28.100
It's all going to waste

14
00:00:28.566 --> 00:00:29.966
Enough to be easy

15
00:00:30.133 --> 00:00:31.533
This is the Lin Group

16
00:00:31.533 --> 00:00:33.600
The sum of net profits over the past five years

17
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.000
And you

18
00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.233
How dare you say anything here

19
00:00:38.333 --> 00:00:41.500
Bring Lin's Group a reputation that has not been met in a century

20
00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:45.000
I see how you communicate with President Nalan

21
00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:48.100
See for yourself

22
00:00:48.766 --> 00:00:50.366
This is me, President Nalan

23
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.500
Sign a new meeting

24
00:00:57.066 --> 00:00:58.400
The original 10 billion project

25
00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.033
President Nalan is unwilling to cooperate

26
00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.900
Now it will agree to increase to 100 billion

27
00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.500
Even with this new contract

28
00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.166
Received the approval of the Nalan venue

29
00:01:08.166 --> 00:01:09.866
That still doesn't change your good taste

30
00:01:09.866 --> 00:01:11.366
Self-asserted facts

31
00:01:11.566 --> 00:01:14.833
Unauthorized increase in investment from 10 billion to 100 billion

32
00:01:15.166 --> 00:01:17.533
You are going to ruin the future of the entire Lin family

33
00:01:17.533 --> 00:01:19.500
Is fixated on this one project

34
00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:20.366
Did you know

35
00:01:20.366 --> 00:01:21.166
100 billion.

36
00:01:21.166 --> 00:01:22.833
The consequences of all the pressure on this project

37
00:01:23.066 --> 00:01:24.866
If this project goes wrong

38
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.100
Temporary was finally removed

39
00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.033
It turns out

40
00:01:32.066 --> 00:01:34.966
Lin Fan is not a piece of business material

41
00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:36.733
If he can get the project right

42
00:01:36.733 --> 00:01:37.966
Sows will climb trees

43
00:01:38.566 --> 00:01:39.366
Second Aunt

44
00:01:39.466 --> 00:01:43.466
I propose to reframe the question of the project leader

45
00:01:43.466 --> 00:01:47.900
That's right, Lin Fan must be cancelled from all positions

46
00:01:47.966 --> 00:01:52.600
Hmph, leave the project to Chu Sheng to be responsible, haha.

47
00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.100
Compare with Lin Fan, a stubborn and unlearned

48
00:01:57.666 --> 00:02:02.633
Chu Sheng is the most suitable candidate, hahaha.

49
00:02:02.933 --> 00:02:06.200
I agree not to let him destroy the entire Lin enterprise
