Hahahaha

20
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.166

Sister, your double label is too obvious, right?

24
00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:01.200
What I'm saying now is

25
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:04.500
The land in Dongshan was included in the planning of the new city

26
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.400
Fan'er, don't sell it

Why don't you rob me and touch me to see?

34
00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:33.866
