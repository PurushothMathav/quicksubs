00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:03.366
Erchan, I think what Sister Shan said is very true

2
00:00:03.366 --> 00:00:03.666
process

3
00:00:03.666 --> 00:00:06.900
The Jianfang collective strike incident is the best proof

4
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.566
Immediate priority

5
00:00:08.566 --> 00:00:11.900
It is to immediately remove the director of frequent projects

6
00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:14.500
Temporary removal at the same time

7
00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:15.600
OK

8
00:00:15.666 --> 00:00:20.100
What Xiaodong said is that urgent matters should be removed.

9
00:00:20.133 --> 00:00:22.366
Forget it, exempt from all emergencies

10
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.300
Fan'er, your eldest sister and Chu Chen are right

11
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.300
Even if you invest in that land in Dongshan

12
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.700
Make a hundredfold

13
00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:35.066
But that doesn't change your unauthorized appropriation

14
00:00:35.133 --> 00:00:37.166
The facts about project funding

15
00:00:37.533 --> 00:00:40.966
Running a company relies on a long-term philosophy

16
00:00:40.966 --> 00:00:43.400
Rather than a fluke or two

17
00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.066
You go like this

18
00:00:47.066 --> 00:00:48.900
I rely on luck

19
00:00:50.266 --> 00:00:51.500
It wasn't a fluke.

20
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:54.166
Could it be that you are still relying on real skills?

21
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.500
Joke this intimacy

22
00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.333
Even our temporary group can't get it.

23
00:00:58.333 --> 00:01:00.566
Not to mention you, the miserable man

24
00:01:00.566 --> 00:01:01.833
How could it be possible to know in advance

25
00:01:02.866 --> 00:01:03.700
I admit it.

26
00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.866
Your relationship with President Nalan is indeed extraordinary

27
00:01:06.866 --> 00:01:08.133
But even so

28
00:01:08.133 --> 00:01:08.500
I think

29
00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.500
It's far from here. President Nalan will reveal to you

30
00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.433
The state of this major secret

31
00:01:13.466 --> 00:01:17.500
Lin Fan, I advise you to honestly get out of the company

32
00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.566
Don't humiliate yourself

33
00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.166
You're an unwelcome thing

34
00:01:23.266 --> 00:01:25.033
Why argue with me

35
00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.466
From now on

36
00:01:27.866 --> 00:01:30.500
I declare your dismissal

37
00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.000
Where the identity of the project leader

38
00:01:33.266 --> 00:01:35.166
Put it in charge

39
00:01:35.566 --> 00:01:38.500
While surfacing and staring

40
00:01:40.366 --> 00:01:43.433
Who said they wanted to remove Mr. Lin?
