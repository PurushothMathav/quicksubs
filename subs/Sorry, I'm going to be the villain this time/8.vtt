00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:14.066
You are stubborn

2
00:00:14.066 --> 00:00:17.200
What right do you have to oppose the entire Lin Group?

3
00:00:17.366 --> 00:00:19.500
Who doesn't know the performance of the company over the years?

4
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.966
Joined the company for less than three years

5
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.400
You've done great things for the company.

6
00:00:24.466 --> 00:00:27.400
And I did it on my own.

7
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:30.333
Created a doubling of yields for three consecutive years

8
00:00:30.333 --> 00:00:33.000
The Myth of Total Profit Breaking 1 billion

9
00:00:33.333 --> 00:00:36.900
And what do you do but eat, drink, prostitute and gamble?

10
00:00:36.966 --> 00:00:37.900
Uncles

11
00:00:38.266 --> 00:00:41.033
I'm afraid there's something you don't know yet

12
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.133
This is the library that just took over the project last month

13
00:00:44.133 --> 00:00:45.700
Directly lead to the company

14
00:00:46.166 --> 00:00:47.866
Lost a whole 1 billion

15
00:00:47.866 --> 00:00:50.133
What is his project?

16
00:00:50.133 --> 00:00:53.233
He actually lost all his three-year profits

17
00:00:54.133 --> 00:00:58.433
The contributions of birth to the company are obvious to all

18
00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.100
Should be the head of the family council

19
00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.466
I was wrong. I lied and made some plans.

20
00:01:05.533 --> 00:01:07.466
Someone is better than Chu Sheng

21
00:01:07.566 --> 00:01:10.633
It's more suitable for this book, hahahaha.

22
00:01:10.866 --> 00:01:12.166
Now it seems

23
00:01:12.166 --> 00:01:15.133
Lim Chusheng serves as deputy head of the family council

24
00:01:15.133 --> 00:01:16.233
That is

25
00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.700
as expected

26
00:01:25.533 --> 00:01:28.433
I lost a billion.

27
00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:31.900
It's not for Lin Chusheng to wipe his butt

28
00:01:31.933 --> 00:01:35.733
The salary of migrant workers is divided into perfect gold for a whole year

29
00:01:35.733 --> 00:01:38.333
If I hadn't taken the project money to pay them off

30
00:01:38.333 --> 00:01:39.166
salary

31
00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:41.233
What do you let them do?

32
00:01:41.466 --> 00:01:42.866
It's not them.

33
00:01:42.933 --> 00:01:46.266
Hard-earned money for a whole year

34
00:01:47.866 --> 00:01:50.900
They're just trash at the bottom of society.

35
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.066
I don't care how they live

36
00:01:53.466 --> 00:01:55.300
Without them

37
00:01:55.566 --> 00:01:57.166
What do you eat?

38
00:01:57.533 --> 00:02:00.300
What to live and wear

39
00:02:01.266 --> 00:02:02.400
Anyway.

40
00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:03.566
Can't change

41
00:02:03.566 --> 00:02:06.266
The fact that you misappropriated project funds without authorization

42
00:02:07.166 --> 00:02:08.766
Hahahaha

43
00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.366
Taking shit can be a fart

44
00:02:12.366 --> 00:02:15.433
I got wet half an hour ago.

45
00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:16.833
Big Diamond

46
00:02:17.566 --> 00:02:18.633
11.7 meters
