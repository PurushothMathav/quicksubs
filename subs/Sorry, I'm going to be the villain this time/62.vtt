1
00:00:00.466 --> 00:00:02.666
Don't be so absolute

2
00:00:04.666 --> 00:00:06.866
How bad is the little flower coming?

3
00:00:09.466 --> 00:00:10.700
Here comes the bitch

4
00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:12.766
Yaoer, you have a good talk

5
00:00:13.366 --> 00:00:15.433
I don't get involved in your young affairs

6
00:00:16.566 --> 00:00:18.500
Yaoer has a good talk

7
00:00:19.533 --> 00:00:21.866
Don't mess around

8
00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.100
I suggest you better die this line

9
00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.000
It is absolutely impossible for me to marry you

10
00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:36.766
This girl?

11
00:00:36.766 --> 00:00:38.166
You will get married sooner or later

12
00:00:38.166 --> 00:00:40.166
So meet a good one

13
00:00:40.166 --> 00:00:42.400
Take the time to marry yourself

14
00:00:42.533 --> 00:00:43.866
Good guy

15
00:00:45.066 --> 00:00:48.200
Who in Zhongzhou doesn't know your name, Ming Shao?

16
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.833
But they misunderstood me.

17
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.766
But don't worry, boss

18
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.200
It won't be long

19
00:00:53.333 --> 00:00:55.100
Everyone in Zhongzhou

20
00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.700
Will be impressed by your husband

21
00:00:57.766 --> 00:00:59.066
Who's your wife?

22
00:00:59.066 --> 00:01:00.166
Don't bark

23
00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.900
Our Qin Shi was ordered by his parents

24
00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.866
Lin Fan tells the truth

25
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.500
I really admire your courage

26
00:01:11.166 --> 00:01:12.900
See those trophies?

27
00:01:13.533 --> 00:01:18.300
I have been the best venture capital star in Zhongzhou for 5 consecutive years

28
00:01:18.366 --> 00:01:22.433
And you, a stubborn person who can only eat, drink, prostitute and vomit

29
00:01:23.366 --> 00:01:24.600
Then how did I hear

30
00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.033
Your latest investment has failed one after another

31
00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:29.333
Do you know what venture capital is?

32
00:01:29.333 --> 00:01:30.200
Golden people also dare to be here

33
00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.733
Wangyi

34
00:01:30.733 --> 00:01:33.366
Venture capital has never been a sure-fire business

35
00:01:33.366 --> 00:01:34.600
Look at him as a whole

36
00:01:34.933 --> 00:01:38.966
My investment even has a minimum return of 70%

37
00:01:38.966 --> 00:01:41.500
And this was at a difficult time.

38
00:01:42.066 --> 00:01:45.400
That's a mere 70%, are you embarrassed to say it?

39
00:01:49.366 --> 00:01:50.466
Notify

40
00:01:50.566 --> 00:01:52.166
The next big investment

41
00:01:52.166 --> 00:01:53.800
Put it on top of the economic company

42
00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.066
As for the Denin era

43
00:01:56.066 --> 00:01:57.233
Don't worry
