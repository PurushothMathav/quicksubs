00:00:00.566 --> 00:00:01.366
Two Chan

2
00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:04.100
This is the information I pulled from the company finance department

3
00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:06.700
10 billion project fee in advance

4
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:09.700
Lin Fan also appropriated 1 billion without authorization

5
00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:12.600
I bought the unwanted wasteland in Dongshan

6
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.766
Just took over the project

7
00:00:14.966 --> 00:00:16.500
Dare to misappropriate public slash without authorization

8
00:00:16.566 --> 00:00:19.466
If he were to continue to be in charge of this project

9
00:00:19.466 --> 00:00:23.166
God knows what's going to happen

10
00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:24.466
What!

11
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:29.000
That land has been on the market for ten years

12
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.433
When you come, you will smash it in your hand.

13
00:00:31.733 --> 00:00:34.700
Normally, a billion is gone.

14
00:00:38.366 --> 00:00:39.633
Kung Fu these days

15
00:00:39.933 --> 00:00:42.200
The company lost nearly $1 billion

16
00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:44.166
If you were to run the company

17
00:00:44.333 --> 00:00:45.800
Isn't that my temporary group?

18
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.000
Please take it to hell

19
00:00:49.166 --> 00:00:51.766
The mother project must be handed over to Shu Sheng immediately

20
00:00:51.766 --> 00:00:54.133
Otherwise, our entire Lin's Group

21
00:00:54.133 --> 00:00:55.600
All because of this project

22
00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.866
Dragged down I agree with Susan

23
00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.066
The project must be handed over to the effective responsibility agreement immediately

24
00:01:03.066 --> 00:01:06.000
Investing is no child's play.

25
00:01:06.066 --> 00:01:07.600
Only Lin Fan can continue fooling around like this

26
00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.900
But the consequences would be unthinkable.

27
00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.900
I agree too.

28
00:01:12.966 --> 00:01:16.000
At the end of summer, Gaoyou students are still responsible for second-hand

29
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.433
Can you make a decision?
