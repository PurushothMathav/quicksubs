1
00:00:02.166 --> 00:00:05.300
Removed from Lin's

2
00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:06.966
That's right, President Nanan

3
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.466
Although Xiaofan is my son

4
00:00:09.466 --> 00:00:12.866
On the phone, talking to you in that tone

5
00:00:12.933 --> 00:00:14.566
It really just doesn't fit

6
00:00:14.566 --> 00:00:16.500
Must be severely punished

7
00:00:18.066 --> 00:00:19.000
What are you standing there for?

8
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.900
Hurry up and apologize to the scolding male president

9
00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.266
Well, this apology is not just about saying

10
00:00:23.266 --> 00:00:25.100
Kneel down

11
00:00:27.766 --> 00:00:30.200
Humph yesterday's humiliation

12
00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:34.233
Today I will pay back all the money with interest

13
00:00:34.466 --> 00:00:35.800
Chu Sheng is right

14
00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:37.033
Kneel and apologize

15
00:00:37.166 --> 00:00:39.500
To show maximum sincerity

16
00:00:39.733 --> 00:00:41.500
Receive the forgiveness of the foreign president

17
00:00:42.866 --> 00:00:44.366
Enrage President Nalan

18
00:00:44.366 --> 00:00:46.500
Let the other party come to apologize

19
00:00:47.166 --> 00:00:49.966
Call President Nalan in this way

20
00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:51.700
My good brother

21
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.566
You are unprecedented

22
00:00:55.666 --> 00:00:57.466
No one will come later.

23
00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.400
Fa is not quick to kneel

24
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.666
This is your last chance.

25
00:01:02.666 --> 00:01:05.566
Mom, it's not that I don't want to kneel

26
00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.500
It's President Nalan, he doesn't agree

27
00:01:09.166 --> 00:01:12.166
You're still talking nonsense at a time like this

28
00:01:12.166 --> 00:01:13.300
My good brother

29
00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:15.400
Why didn't I see that before?

30
00:01:15.466 --> 00:01:17.533
Your ability to lie

31
00:01:17.533 --> 00:01:18.633
So awesome

32
00:01:21.066 --> 00:01:24.266
Fan'er, have you had enough trouble?

33
00:01:26.566 --> 00:01:27.766
President Alan

34
00:01:28.366 --> 00:01:29.700
Do you think so?

35
00:01:33.966 --> 00:01:34.766
thing

36
00:01:39.266 --> 00:01:42.966
The opportunity is yours.

37
00:01:43.766 --> 00:01:45.566
hand

38
00:01:47.933 --> 00:01:48.866
give up
