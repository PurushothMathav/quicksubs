1
00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:03.566
With my investment ability

2
00:00:03.566 --> 00:00:04.566
Give me this money

3
00:00:04.566 --> 00:00:07.366
Make at least 30 profit points per year

4
00:00:07.566 --> 00:00:09.333
What's wrong with this money?

5
00:00:09.333 --> 00:00:11.100
Must be put on this project

6
00:00:12.566 --> 00:00:13.366
Chu Wei Shubo

7
00:00:13.966 --> 00:00:15.233
What do you think?

8
00:00:16.366 --> 00:00:17.866
Sheng Shao is right

9
00:00:17.866 --> 00:00:19.866
If according to the original plan

10
00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:21.500
Only power batteries are produced.

11
00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.066
Small investment pays off quickly

12
00:00:23.166 --> 00:00:26.900
There is absolutely no need to expand to the entire complete handicap.

13
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.900
Yes, hahahaha.

14
00:00:34.166 --> 00:00:36.133
Invest in mobile payments

15
00:00:36.133 --> 00:00:38.000
Lost half in a few days

16
00:00:38.366 --> 00:00:43.000
It is the investment ability you mentioned.

17
00:00:44.566 --> 00:00:46.266
To really control the market

18
00:00:46.266 --> 00:00:48.033
Have absolute words

19
00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.066
It is necessary to achieve the settlement of the whole industry

20
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.166
Now there is strong support from the capital

21
00:00:55.166 --> 00:00:56.733
It is this opportunity

22
00:00:56.733 --> 00:00:59.300
As long as you seize the opportunity

23
00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.566
Production was completed one year later

24
00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:05.033
We Lin's

25
00:01:05.766 --> 00:01:09.266
Will be far ahead in this industry

26
00:01:09.266 --> 00:01:10.800
No one can match the light

27
00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.600
I want to support the next operation of this project

28
00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.000
With the support of only one government

29
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.400
Is not enough

30
00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.866
At least get the support of the center

31
00:01:20.933 --> 00:01:24.100
Lin Fan is in the center axis, you have the help of Nalan Venue

32
00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:25.600
Can gain insight into opportunities

33
00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.566
But look at the whole building

34
00:01:27.566 --> 00:01:28.866
You are just an ant

35
00:01:29.066 --> 00:01:31.400
Only the weak rely on relationships

36
00:01:31.733 --> 00:01:34.000
But get future planning news

37
00:01:34.366 --> 00:01:36.366
The real strong

38
00:01:36.466 --> 00:01:38.300
You're on your own.

39
00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.400
Possessing a keen eye and market insight

40
00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.900
You can see everything

41
00:01:42.966 --> 00:01:45.300
No matter how much hype you say

42
00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:47.600
It won't change your project investment and stubbornness

43
00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:48.966
Fair Fact

44
00:01:51.466 --> 00:01:55.100
Lin Fan, you insist again and again

45
00:01:55.166 --> 00:01:57.700
Must be upgraded to the entire completed industrial chain

46
00:01:58.466 --> 00:01:59.900
Isn't it?

47
00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:02.633
Do you have any other selfishness in it?

48
00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:04.766
Or should I say

49
00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.466
In addition to embezzling project funds

50
00:02:07.933 --> 00:02:10.500
What else did you do?
