1
00:00:02.333 --> 00:00:03.800
Want to acquire shares

2
00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:05.666
To achieve the purpose of absolute controlling stake

3
00:00:05.766 --> 00:00:08.500
At least 51% of the shares are required

4
00:00:08.766 --> 00:00:10.166
But after delivery

5
00:00:10.166 --> 00:00:13.066
But it holds more than 35% of the shares

6
00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.300
Then add other heavy players

7
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:17.300
15% of the original shares.

8
00:00:17.533 --> 00:00:19.700
Even if all the fractional shares on the market

9
00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:20.866
All acquired

10
00:00:20.933 --> 00:00:24.100
Plus 0, it's only 52%.

11
00:00:25.333 --> 00:00:28.166
He has a 35% stake in the basket giver

12
00:00:28.166 --> 00:00:29.566
5% of them

13
00:00:30.266 --> 00:00:32.033
Under the collar reserve statement

14
00:00:32.133 --> 00:00:34.266
Now this part of the shares

15
00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:35.666
Missing my water

16
00:00:37.366 --> 00:00:40.000
In this case, there is no problem with the share ratio

17
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.400
But the capital investment required

18
00:00:43.533 --> 00:00:46.000
It's going to be an astronomical number.

19
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:47.833
Jingyao is right

20
00:00:47.966 --> 00:00:50.300
Lin's through cooperation with our Zhongzhou Chamber of Commerce

21
00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:51.800
Shares keep soaring

22
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:54.566
Especially after the official news from the capital was released

23
00:00:54.566 --> 00:00:57.300
Plus some gossip from the center

24
00:00:57.466 --> 00:00:59.233
Now I want to acquire Lin's

25
00:00:59.533 --> 00:01:02.400
At least 200 billion in liquidity is required

26
00:01:03.866 --> 00:01:05.500
200 billion is no small matter

27
00:01:05.566 --> 00:01:08.633
My current market value of Zhang's is nothing more than that

28
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.466
Although the market value of the Zhongzhou Chamber of Commerce is over trillion

29
00:01:12.566 --> 00:01:13.766
But there is no way

30
00:01:13.766 --> 00:01:15.866
Take out so much liquidity at one time

31
00:01:20.466 --> 00:01:23.400
200 billion on this card.

32
00:01:24.066 --> 00:01:27.200
Enough to acquire 03 shares of the provisional group
