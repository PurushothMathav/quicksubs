1
00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.500
President Nalan in the Middle East Association

2
00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:04.600
At least the Grand Sage Chamber of Commerce is close

3
00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:08.366
It's a small thing that this Noah Lai president project is lost.

4
00:00:08.666 --> 00:00:11.400
I'm afraid my temporary group will be in Zhongzhou in the future

5
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.900
No place to stand anymore

6
00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:15.733
Second sister-in-law Nalan President

7
00:00:15.733 --> 00:00:17.566
It's already reached that point right away

8
00:00:17.966 --> 00:00:19.000
Never give up

9
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.900
Remember the chance to reach the sky in one step?

10
00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.133
Of course I know what you're saying

11
00:00:24.133 --> 00:00:25.066
only

12
00:00:26.166 --> 00:00:30.400
Fan'er, go talk to President Nalan again

13
00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:34.300
Mom, I believe it will be fine for you to come forward.

14
00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:35.466
This, of course.

15
00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:36.900
Just a word from me

16
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:38.500
President Nalan will definitely continue to pass

17
00:00:38.966 --> 00:00:42.500
Mom knew my son would be fine to come forward

18
00:00:42.766 --> 00:00:43.666
Okay, okay.

19
00:00:44.566 --> 00:00:48.866
Oh, fortunately, Zhao used the president's friendship to lose money

20
00:00:49.166 --> 00:00:51.366
Otherwise, the fat of the rice will be lost.

21
00:00:51.366 --> 00:00:52.766
I don't know where to cry

22
00:00:52.766 --> 00:00:54.266
Hahahaha

23
00:00:54.366 --> 00:00:55.900
According to Nalai Huiniang

24
00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:58.400
This project is capable of enabling the Lin Group

25
00:00:58.566 --> 00:01:01.433
Deng Building's top group ranks

26
00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:03.600
Hey, don't be so excited

27
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.566
I'm just saying I can handle President Nalan

28
00:01:06.933 --> 00:01:09.566
But I didn't say I was going to do it.

29
00:01:12.733 --> 00:01:16.000
Xiaofan, you can't let go of you.

30
00:01:16.133 --> 00:01:17.266
When angry

31
00:01:17.266 --> 00:01:19.500
His only wish is to lead you

32
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.233
To the top of the summer sky?

33
00:01:23.733 --> 00:01:25.166
Yes, yes, Xiaofan

34
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.200
This is the only one

35
00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.800
Finish your dad's one-month opportunity?

36
00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:30.266
universal miss

37
00:01:31.666 --> 00:01:32.766
It depends.

38
00:01:35.133 --> 00:01:36.366
sb's attitude
