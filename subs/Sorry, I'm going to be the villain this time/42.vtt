00:00:00.466 --> 00:00:01.700
What is written?

2
00:00:09.466 --> 00:00:10.633
This is the capital

3
00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:12.800
Official documents to vigorously support the TV industry

4
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:13.633
What!

5
00:00:14.366 --> 00:00:17.966
The capital will suddenly support without news

6
00:00:18.466 --> 00:00:19.966
The current valuation of this project

7
00:00:20.466 --> 00:00:22.000
It has been reached.

8
00:00:22.666 --> 00:00:25.233
200 billion, hahaha.

9
00:00:25.266 --> 00:00:28.833
Our decision to invest in this project is 10 billion

10
00:00:29.533 --> 00:00:33.200
Half the valuation of the project is 100 billion

11
00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:36.433
If we don't raise the investment to 100 billion

12
00:00:36.933 --> 00:00:40.166
You have to make 10 times the profit.

13
00:00:40.166 --> 00:00:43.800
Ah hahahahaha more than ten times

14
00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:45.300
As long as there are Du Fu's clothes

15
00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:49.200
The future development is certainly immeasurable

16
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.200
The value can continue to skyrocket

17
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.400
Hahahahaha family head

18
00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.600
Members of the family council

19
00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.433
So this is the latest project that we're working on at Fanmao.

20
00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.866
Our project will begin with the production of power batteries

21
00:01:04.866 --> 00:01:06.133
It includes wind energy.

22
00:01:06.133 --> 00:01:07.200
Water energy light energy

23
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.966
Renewable fuels, etc

24
00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.466
The entire complete industrial layout

25
00:01:11.466 --> 00:01:12.766
After it is built

26
00:01:12.766 --> 00:01:14.666
It will become the largest in the country

27
00:01:14.666 --> 00:01:15.200
Yeah.

28
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.533
The world's only new type with an industry-wide layout

29
00:01:18.533 --> 00:01:19.566
Energy project

30
00:01:22.533 --> 00:01:23.700
You just said

31
00:01:23.766 --> 00:01:27.166
The planning for this project was done by Fan'er

32
00:01:29.066 --> 00:01:29.866
Yes!

33
00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.200
I didn't expect him to be so stubborn

34
00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.366
To be able to make such a perfect plan

35
00:01:38.766 --> 00:01:39.833
Could it be that

36
00:01:41.066 --> 00:01:44.433
His previous behavior was to pretend to be a pig and eat a tiger

37
00:01:45.666 --> 00:01:47.500
Even if the project gets Du Fu

38
00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:48.733
Valuation skyrocketed by hundreds of billions

39
00:01:48.733 --> 00:01:51.133
That investment is only equal to the return

40
00:01:51.133 --> 00:01:53.466
The investment amount and return are the same

41
00:01:53.666 --> 00:01:55.966
That's not spending money on fireworks. What is it?
