00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:04.033
Hahaha, it skyrocketed a hundred times in three minutes

2
00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:06.166
Unless that becomes the city center

3
00:00:06.166 --> 00:00:07.266
How is that possible?

4
00:00:07.266 --> 00:00:10.033
It's just a wasteland that no one wants

5
00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:12.100
Everyone is right

6
00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:14.666
Unless Du Fu's side introduces the land in Dongshan

7
00:00:14.666 --> 00:00:15.966
Super favorable policy

8
00:00:15.966 --> 00:00:19.233
Otherwise you might be right

9
00:00:19.866 --> 00:00:20.800
In 3 minutes

10
00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.666
The land in Dongshan has skyrocketed a hundredfold.

11
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.900
I see your ability to lie with your eyes open

12
00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:28.366
But more and more ruthless

13
00:00:28.533 --> 00:00:31.366
Hahaha, you think you are a multi-handed adult.

14
00:00:31.366 --> 00:00:33.500
Say it in 3 minutes

15
00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.100
I really don't know.

16
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.033
How could the second uncle of the first generation be born?

17
00:00:42.366 --> 00:00:43.366
Come on, Val.

18
00:00:43.366 --> 00:00:45.500
I know you don't want to take this project

19
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:46.466
Give it to the body

20
00:00:46.466 --> 00:00:47.966
But what you said

21
00:00:47.966 --> 00:00:50.466
Are you taking everyone for a fool?

22
00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.866
You let me down so much.

23
00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:58.200
son

24
00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.000
I think it's better to give him another three minutes

25
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.366
After all, we don't care about the time.

26
00:01:03.366 --> 00:01:04.966
Maybe in three minutes

27
00:01:04.966 --> 00:01:07.266
People can really skyrocket a hundredfold

28
00:01:07.266 --> 00:01:09.966
Hahahahaha

29
00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:13.466
I also think we should give this opportunity.

30
00:01:13.466 --> 00:01:16.100
But what about these three minutes?

31
00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:17.600
Can't wait in vain
