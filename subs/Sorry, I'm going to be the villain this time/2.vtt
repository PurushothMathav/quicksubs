00:00:05.333 --> 00:00:08.633
The eldest lady on the mountain said it was not good

2
00:00:08.666 --> 00:00:10.333
Miss Zhuo can't send a signal

3
00:00:10.333 --> 00:00:11.266
But the whole cloud top

4
00:00:11.266 --> 00:00:13.666
The sky is all banned

5
00:00:13.666 --> 00:00:14.666
We can't get in.

6
00:00:14.666 --> 00:00:16.966
How dare he, Lin Fan?

7
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.000
That's Miss Zhuo

8
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.466
Zhuo Dongsheng's pearl in the palm of his eye

9
00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:23.266
Take a run.

10
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.400
I told you to rush ahead and you told me you couldn't get in

11
00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:35.400
YARU

12
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:37.400
Yes

13
00:00:41.533 --> 00:00:44.866
Get lost frizzy said no one can enter

14
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.066
Pardon me?

15
00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.433
Frizzy old recovery, how dare I disobey you

16
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.600
Can you say that again?

17
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:55.833
It's edamame.

18
00:00:57.466 --> 00:00:58.500
Stupid

19
00:00:59.766 --> 00:01:00.666
Lin Fan

20
00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.566
How dare you defile Miss Zhuo and violate me

21
00:01:03.566 --> 00:01:04.766
I want your life!

22
00:01:04.766 --> 00:01:06.166
Kill me

23
00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:10.400
How dare you hit me?

24
00:01:11.266 --> 00:01:12.000
I hit you

25
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.166
Does a neighbor need to pick a time?

26
00:01:15.166 --> 00:01:16.300
What about the ring?

27
00:01:16.366 --> 00:01:19.233
I am our father's most beloved son

28
00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.166
I only ask you once

29
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.600
Who's your father?

30
00:01:29.766 --> 00:01:30.566
demon

31
00:01:32.266 --> 00:01:34.500
You remember it for me.

32
00:01:34.533 --> 00:01:36.400
Even if you dare to be surnamed Lin

33
00:01:36.966 --> 00:01:39.000
It can't change your bones

34
00:01:39.566 --> 00:01:41.133
Yang is shit

35
00:01:41.133 --> 00:01:44.266
I am the only disciple of the Lin family

36
00:01:44.266 --> 00:01:47.766
But it's a wild seed that my mother brought back from outside
