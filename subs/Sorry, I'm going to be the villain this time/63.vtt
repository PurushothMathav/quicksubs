00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:03.966
What do you mean?

2
00:00:03.966 --> 00:00:07.533
This is the rumored number one investment queen in China

3
00:00:07.533 --> 00:00:09.233
Investment decisions made

4
00:00:09.866 --> 00:00:11.033
shortsighted

5
00:00:11.266 --> 00:00:12.133
narrow-minded

6
00:00:12.133 --> 00:00:13.233
Eyeless

7
00:00:13.533 --> 00:00:14.800
But that's it.

8
00:00:18.333 --> 00:00:20.233
I was shortsighted.

9
00:00:21.166 --> 00:00:22.733
I am narrow-minded

10
00:00:22.733 --> 00:00:24.333
I have no eyes

11
00:00:24.333 --> 00:00:27.700
Did you know I went to a top business school?

12
00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:29.400
Received the highest education

13
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.666
Has an absolute keen eye for market development prospects

14
00:00:32.666 --> 00:00:34.133
Did you ever know

15
00:00:34.133 --> 00:00:36.900
I am a native of Zhongzhou Venture Capital Region

16
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:38.600
Did you ever know

17
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.766
The best VC trader of the year is me

18
00:00:42.066 --> 00:00:44.200
The company I just invested in

19
00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:45.966
Whether it is business potential

20
00:00:45.966 --> 00:00:46.900
Industry direction

21
00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:49.566
And future plans and so on

22
00:00:49.566 --> 00:00:52.700
They are all the hottest potential stocks at the moment

23
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.800
Is for me to invest in such a company and setbacks

24
00:00:56.166 --> 00:00:58.200
Your so-called bare hands are hot

25
00:00:58.366 --> 00:01:00.300
Just like your trophies

26
00:01:00.366 --> 00:01:03.133
It's all stuff that doesn't look good

27
00:01:03.133 --> 00:01:04.033
how

28
00:01:04.966 --> 00:01:09.566
Are you talking about these hot concepts?

29
00:01:09.566 --> 00:01:10.900
Industry and plunge

30
00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.800
Instead, it was the cold Deyun era

31
00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.233
Valuations are going to skyrocket.

32
00:01:17.733 --> 00:01:19.366
Yes, in a previous life

33
00:01:19.366 --> 00:01:22.133
Now, these hard-to-reach concepts are meanings.

34
00:01:22.133 --> 00:01:24.166
It's just a flash in the pan.

35
00:01:24.166 --> 00:01:25.933
After a short period of heat

36
00:01:25.933 --> 00:01:29.266
It soon hit rock bottom with policy adjustments

37
00:01:29.333 --> 00:01:32.366
Make countless investors lose their lives

38
00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:34.300
It was the Denin era.

39
00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:35.200
Substance is too low

40
00:01:35.533 --> 00:01:37.466
Catching up with the express train of policy again

41
00:01:37.466 --> 00:01:39.500
Even skyrocketed 50 times

42
00:01:39.933 --> 00:01:41.266
Ah!

43
00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:42.700
Ha ha.

44
00:01:43.766 --> 00:01:44.633
Ridiculous

45
00:01:45.966 --> 00:01:46.366
Denning

46
00:01:46.366 --> 00:01:48.700
The era is just a family with no development at all

47
00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:49.900
Prospect company

48
00:01:50.166 --> 00:01:53.366
How can it be compared with Jingxi Company?

49
00:01:53.666 --> 00:01:56.000
Since you are so disdainful of my investment

50
00:01:56.066 --> 00:01:57.333
Why don't we wait?

51
00:01:57.333 --> 00:01:59.666
Waiting for this moment
