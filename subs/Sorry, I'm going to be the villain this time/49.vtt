00:00:00.566 --> 00:00:03.200
No, no, it's all a misunderstanding

2
00:00:07.466 --> 00:00:11.466
Now I declare that you are the head of the family

3
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:13.566
From now on

4
00:00:14.166 --> 00:00:16.900
Where are you and the Zhongzhou Chamber of Commerce?

5
00:00:16.966 --> 00:00:20.200
The only person in charge of the project cooperation

6
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:21.700
Never change

7
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.466
Do you understand?

8
00:00:28.466 --> 00:00:29.266
Understand

9
00:00:29.733 --> 00:00:34.166
You leave, where is the ability to perceive advanced insights

10
00:00:34.666 --> 00:00:36.766
No one is more suitable for this project than him

11
00:00:36.766 --> 00:00:37.700
Right?

12
00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:38.700
Hahahaha

13
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.500
That's right, it's only been two days

14
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.766
Fan Shao has achieved amazing achievements

15
00:00:44.766 --> 00:00:47.633
I believe that under the leadership of Fan Shao

16
00:00:47.966 --> 00:00:48.966
This project

17
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:50.833
Will give to Lingshi Group

18
00:00:50.933 --> 00:00:54.100
Bringing immeasurable development prospects

19
00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:55.166
Yes Yes Yes Yes

20
00:00:57.866 --> 00:00:59.566
Did you hear that?

21
00:00:59.966 --> 00:01:01.066
Are you now?

22
00:01:01.066 --> 00:01:03.033
Be the person in charge of this project

23
00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.900
That's what everyone expected.

24
00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:07.000
Hey.

25
00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.966
You were here last time

26
00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.200
Deprive me of my family membership

27
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.600
Delete from the company

28
00:01:13.933 --> 00:01:15.000
Again today.

29
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.466
Huh?

30
00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.266
Let me be the person in charge if the group needs it.

31
00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.566
Kick me when you're done

32
00:01:24.366 --> 00:01:27.433
Mom, what do you take me for?

33
00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.000
Oops, Fan'er, you're talking nonsense again, aren't you?

34
00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.300
Mom did all this

35
00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.266
It's all for your own good

36
00:01:36.666 --> 00:01:38.533
Like you said.

37
00:01:38.533 --> 00:01:40.766
You are your father's only son

38
00:01:40.766 --> 00:01:43.966
He is the only heir to the Lin Group

39
00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.633
Sure enough, she is an old woman in the world

40
00:01:47.733 --> 00:01:48.833
If it was before

41
00:01:49.566 --> 00:01:51.700
I'm afraid I'm really going to be the only one by you

42
00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.700
The heir's words were blinded

43
00:01:53.866 --> 00:01:55.200
What a pity!

44
00:01:55.366 --> 00:01:58.466
I've already died once.

45
00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:02.500
That's pretty good.

46
00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:08.166
As the only legally integrated group

47
00:02:08.666 --> 00:02:12.466
Really think about the company all the time

48
00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.700
Instead, my mother knew she wanted me to take over the project again

49
00:02:16.966 --> 00:02:19.633
Yes, but I have one condition.

50
00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:22.966
willing to admit defeat

51
00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:30.433
Make him Lin Chusheng pay me back the bet

52
00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.966
I was immediately taken back to campus by the company
