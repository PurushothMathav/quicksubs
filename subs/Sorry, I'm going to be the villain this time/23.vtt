1
00:00:00.533 --> 00:00:01.200
I really do.

2
00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:03.000
That trash Lin Fan sang for Nalan

3
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.366
What? You ruined him?

4
00:00:04.366 --> 00:00:07.766
He actually said that he only cooperated with him on some project

5
00:00:08.066 --> 00:00:10.133
Lin Fan, this ignorant trash

6
00:00:10.133 --> 00:00:12.566
How could he really gain President Nalan's appreciation?

7
00:00:12.566 --> 00:00:15.133
There's something wrong with this.

8
00:00:15.133 --> 00:00:18.566
When I find out his problem is his death

9
00:00:18.566 --> 00:00:20.766
Yes, the face is this face.

10
00:00:21.133 --> 00:00:22.200
But here's the thing.

11
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.900
We can't get involved in this project at all

12
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:26.766
What are you afraid of?

13
00:00:27.133 --> 00:00:29.633
Now you are the CFO of the company.

14
00:00:29.866 --> 00:00:32.100
In charge of financial investment, etc

15
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:35.433
Just cut that waste in half in project funding

16
00:00:36.266 --> 00:00:37.966
Then there is a problem

17
00:00:37.966 --> 00:00:39.166
Delayed progress

18
00:00:39.166 --> 00:00:42.566
His good days are over

19
00:00:42.566 --> 00:00:45.500
Brother is enough

20
00:00:45.766 --> 00:00:49.866
We're going back. We need me

21
00:00:53.466 --> 00:00:56.233
There is a problem with the evening project recommendation.

22
00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:01.166
I didn't expect it.

23
00:01:01.166 --> 00:01:03.966
In order to compete with me for Lin's, good brothers in the country

24
00:01:03.966 --> 00:01:05.666
I'm really willing to spend money

25
00:01:05.666 --> 00:01:08.466
First, use tens of billions of projects to buy turbid Yanran color friends

26
00:01:08.466 --> 00:01:10.500
Just to monitor my every move

27
00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.700
Even more willing to put their own secret lover

28
00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:13.900
Send it over as a secretary

29
00:01:16.066 --> 00:01:19.200
The tens of billions of funds launched by the project have arrived 1 billion

30
00:01:19.466 --> 00:01:21.466
You can't pack the rest

31
00:01:22.566 --> 00:01:24.366
Use money to be a dog

32
00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.900
That's not very clever

33
00:01:28.666 --> 00:01:32.100
But money is not an ordinary eccentric

34
00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.000
He actually let him lead Chu Sheng directly

35
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.700
Be the company's chief financial officer

36
00:01:35.766 --> 00:01:38.433
What should I do now?

37
00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.966
Where is less

38
00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:46.400
passed
