1
00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:01.500
you

2
00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:04.600
I also bought that

3
00:00:05.366 --> 00:00:08.033
Dad doesn't understand me as a daughter

4
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:11.900
It is more obligatory for you to lie down

5
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.666
Here's your relationship with that truck driver

6
00:00:18.666 --> 00:00:20.100
All the information

7
00:00:22.566 --> 00:00:24.900
I know the truck driver

8
00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.000
So what? What does this prove?

9
00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:34.433
Then this call log

10
00:00:35.166 --> 00:00:36.066
Ha ha.

11
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.900
Just call records first?

12
00:00:39.466 --> 00:00:42.100
What does that prove?

13
00:00:42.166 --> 00:00:43.833
Trying to take me down

14
00:00:44.333 --> 00:00:45.966
It's not even close.

15
00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:49.400
Even if you think I'm doing well, so what?

16
00:00:49.566 --> 00:00:51.366
What you did

17
00:00:51.366 --> 00:00:54.733
It's just some vacation with my disciple

18
00:00:54.733 --> 00:00:56.566
Hahahaha

19
00:00:58.666 --> 00:01:02.000
I used to eat on my lap

20
00:01:05.933 --> 00:01:07.466
Entrusted by Mr. Inlin

21
00:01:07.966 --> 00:01:10.700
Shares of the fourth uncle of the neighboring family council

22
00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.966
All have been transferred to Mr. Lin's competition.

23
00:01:12.966 --> 00:01:16.166
In addition to all Mr. Lin's shares in the market

24
00:01:16.166 --> 00:01:18.066
Also found Mr. Lin's game

25
00:01:18.933 --> 00:01:21.666
And it passed an hour ago.

26
00:01:21.666 --> 00:01:22.966
What would shock be?

27
00:01:22.966 --> 00:01:26.700
Now you have become Lin's Group

28
00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.066
Largest family member

29
00:01:28.066 --> 00:01:30.433
And it's a later family member

30
00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:34.633
That's not possible.

31
00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.800
What if you become the largest shareholder in the family?

32
00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:43.133
You are the family council system

33
00:01:43.133 --> 00:01:47.433
Even if I only own 30% of the shares

34
00:01:47.533 --> 00:01:51.800
They hold 51% of the voting rights

35
00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.900
Hahaha your voting rights

36
00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:56.033
It's your opportunity. Do you use it?
