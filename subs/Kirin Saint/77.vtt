00:00:05.766 --> 00:00:06.933
This is not leading

2
00:00:06.933 --> 00:00:09.466
Four heroes who have attacked heroes since ancient times?

3
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.200
How did they come?

4
00:00:11.766 --> 00:00:13.700
This is the blogger who threatened my hero

5
00:00:14.266 --> 00:00:15.766
Half awake

6
00:00:16.766 --> 00:00:18.166
Four evil emperors

7
00:00:18.466 --> 00:00:20.100
How dare you

8
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.466
Don't you know that Southern Province is the hinterland of martial arts?

9
00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:25.600
Haha hinterland

10
00:00:25.933 --> 00:00:27.233
Laugh.

11
00:00:27.466 --> 00:00:32.566
This place is about to become a part of our four-nation alliance

12
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:35.866
The two gods will ruin your life

13
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:39.866
Operation is always a leftover woman

14
00:00:39.866 --> 00:00:41.633
Let's do it.

15
00:00:42.266 --> 00:00:45.800
What a rich breath of living people

16
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.466
Destroy the hero

17
00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:53.633
Just start with you women

18
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.233
Let go of me

19
00:00:57.066 --> 00:00:58.766
Dare to take me to be presumptuous in the building

20
00:00:58.766 --> 00:01:00.300
I see you are living putty

21
00:01:01.066 --> 00:01:02.733
Here comes my juggernaut

22
00:01:02.733 --> 00:01:04.933
I didn't save them both.

23
00:01:04.933 --> 00:01:07.033
But the two mountains of martial arts at that time

24
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.066
You can't beat them.

25
00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:10.366
Surrender desperately

26
00:01:10.666 --> 00:01:12.033
Alpine

27
00:01:12.566 --> 00:01:15.100
I'll show you today.

28
00:01:15.266 --> 00:01:19.166
How big are the so-called mountains?

29
00:01:19.166 --> 00:01:21.300
vulnerable
