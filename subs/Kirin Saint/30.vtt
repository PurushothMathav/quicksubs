00:00:01.866 --> 00:00:04.266
Ladies and gentlemen, there are soldiers here today.

2
00:00:04.266 --> 00:00:07.366
No matter how many conspiracy trajectories he has

3
00:00:07.366 --> 00:00:09.000
We have nothing to fear

4
00:00:09.133 --> 00:00:11.233
But don't fall for him

5
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.600
It's the hype you say again

6
00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:15.733
It doesn't change you from running into trouble

7
00:00:15.733 --> 00:00:17.366
Murder for money.

8
00:00:17.366 --> 00:00:19.766
Murder for money, don't put a hat on yourself

9
00:00:19.766 --> 00:00:20.900
White collar is you

10
00:00:21.466 --> 00:00:23.533
God of War Ye, my Xiao family

11
00:00:23.533 --> 00:00:26.866
I had no intention of participating in the entanglement of your nine clans with this son

12
00:00:27.333 --> 00:00:28.833
But according to my son

13
00:00:28.966 --> 00:00:32.200
Please leave my Xiao family in public

14
00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:33.433
Compare with my Xiao family

15
00:00:33.533 --> 00:00:37.466
That being the case, I have to come forward and get justice

16
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.000
Family Head Xiao does have this matter

17
00:00:40.466 --> 00:00:45.066
He kept saying that the old man relied on him to lift his shoes

18
00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.733
Everyone here heard it

19
00:00:47.733 --> 00:00:50.966
Is he not a jerk?

20
00:00:51.133 --> 00:00:54.033
Do you really think my Xiao family doesn't dare to do it?

21
00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.200
deal with

22
00:00:55.266 --> 00:00:58.166
Mr. Xiao was the godfather when he met throughout the summer

23
00:00:58.166 --> 00:01:01.366
The status of the emergency department is far from being comparable to that of boys

24
00:01:01.366 --> 00:01:03.166
You can bicker with the Eight Families

25
00:01:03.466 --> 00:01:05.333
But you can't shoot at Mr. Xiao

26
00:01:05.333 --> 00:01:07.233
Come? I owe my father

27
00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.033
That sounds pretty cool.

28
00:01:09.166 --> 00:01:10.666
Do you have his contact information?

29
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.500
I do know that.

30
00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.433
But why do you

31
00:01:15.366 --> 00:01:16.200
Oh, I see.

32
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.600
You want to plead with him directly, right?

33
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:19.500
Then I'll call for you.

34
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.400
Perhaps he is generous.

35
00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.300
Don't bother with us

36
00:01:23.333 --> 00:01:24.433
I promise him.

37
00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:27.466
Do you want him to go back and apologize?
