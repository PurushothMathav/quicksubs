00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:03.266
I, Brother Lu Zhao, am the youngest consortium in Southern Province

2
00:00:03.266 --> 00:00:06.366
The master is also the head of Bailining on the Forbes list

3
00:00:06.933 --> 00:00:07.866
unparalleled achievement

4
00:00:07.866 --> 00:00:09.266
You say everything I got

5
00:00:09.266 --> 00:00:11.100
It's all because of your unicorn music

6
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:14.433
Your brain was kicked by a donkey

7
00:00:14.566 --> 00:00:16.266
Ten years since Ye Qingmei joined the army

8
00:00:16.266 --> 00:00:17.300
Heroic achievements

9
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.266
There are also the four gods of war of the Heavenly Sword, the Thunder God of War

10
00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:21.133
value me

11
00:00:21.133 --> 00:00:23.266
I am about to be named the fifth god of war

12
00:00:23.266 --> 00:00:25.333
Your so-called unicorn charm

13
00:00:25.333 --> 00:00:27.700
It's like taking all the credit for yourself.

14
00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:28.800
I'm not sweet

15
00:00:28.933 --> 00:00:30.500
But I was born to steal fists

16
00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:33.300
It is also Yunying, a rare voice genius from a century ago

17
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.100
Soon I will become Shao Zong of Yunyin Jun

18
00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.333
Lead Quanzong to hear the new glory

19
00:00:38.333 --> 00:00:39.700
Don't tell me

20
00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:40.566
All of this.

21
00:00:40.566 --> 00:00:42.866
It's all in your mouth with the rhyme of the heart

22
00:00:42.866 --> 00:00:45.333
That's right, the secret on you

23
00:00:45.333 --> 00:00:49.100
All the laws of creation are given by my own hands

24
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.400
The royal face is shameless and ridiculous

25
00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:54.500
This is the scientific 21st century.

26
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.233
What shit unicorn charm

27
00:00:56.266 --> 00:00:57.966
Just lie to my nine families

28
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.200
Hmph, you don't deserve it

29
00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:01.700
The three of you were there

30
00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:03.500
And I've seen it happen.

31
00:01:03.533 --> 00:01:05.133
Why don't you remember?

32
00:01:05.133 --> 00:01:06.500
And I'm still standing here.

33
00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.700
And they look the same as they did 20 years ago.

34
00:01:08.733 --> 00:01:10.066
Can't it be painted like this?

35
00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:11.766
How could I not remember?

36
00:01:12.066 --> 00:01:14.433
I see your disgusting word now

37
00:01:14.733 --> 00:01:15.866
Feel like vomiting

38
00:01:15.866 --> 00:01:18.200
I don't care what tricks you used back then

39
00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:19.466
Lied to our parents

40
00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.366
What can be done now to make the appearance serious?

41
00:01:22.366 --> 00:01:23.500
But let me tell you something.

42
00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.766
Your lies will be destroyed today

43
00:01:25.766 --> 00:01:27.366
Today is different

44
00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.033
We are getting married

45
00:01:31.266 --> 00:01:32.300
Here is 500.

46
00:01:32.466 --> 00:01:33.966
As a divorce project

47
00:01:33.966 --> 00:01:36.900
Enough for you redneck to go back to the country

48
00:01:37.466 --> 00:01:38.566
Abandoned enough

49
00:01:39.733 --> 00:01:41.200
A good nine families

50
00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:42.800
You were cornered

51
00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.900
Kneeling in front of me rocking chair begging for mercy

52
00:01:44.933 --> 00:01:46.033
Deathly posture

53
00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:48.166
Not even a drowning dog

54
00:01:48.333 --> 00:01:50.566
And now it's turning around and biting me

55
00:01:50.566 --> 00:01:52.233
Ling Zaozhi

56
00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.733
I might as well have given this luck

57
00:01:54.733 --> 00:01:56.700
Give you nine wild dogs

58
00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.800
You're just a town and a village

59
00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:00.600
Our nine families are giving you steps down.

60
00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.366
If you continue to talk nonsense

61
00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.300
Don't blame Ben for being rude to you.

62
00:02:05.366 --> 00:02:07.300
You keep thinking about what will happen to you

63
00:02:07.333 --> 00:02:09.000
I warned your fathers

64
00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:10.266
Once divorced

65
00:02:10.333 --> 00:02:11.500
Everything is coming

66
00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.600
The wine industry will suffer an unbearable catastrophe

67
00:02:14.766 --> 00:02:16.666
I was the only one who broke the engagement

68
00:02:16.666 --> 00:02:18.000
You don't let it

69
00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.400
It's a pity that I'm not satisfied with your performance today

70
00:02:22.933 --> 00:02:25.400
So when I cleared my head

71
00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:26.666
Let's talk about it again

72
00:02:28.866 --> 00:02:31.600
What does this mean since you don't want to get married?

73
00:02:31.733 --> 00:02:33.366
Then let me come out

74
00:02:33.366 --> 00:02:35.500
Even if I think about my fiancÃ©

75
00:02:35.533 --> 00:02:37.766
That must be a wealthy family infection

76
00:02:37.766 --> 00:02:39.100
Noble affairs

77
00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:41.966
And you are a country name

78
00:02:41.966 --> 00:02:43.266
Mixed with burial

79
00:02:44.166 --> 00:02:44.966
sit and wait

80
00:02:49.266 --> 00:02:51.500
Today's Jilin Convention

81
00:02:52.566 --> 00:02:53.866
I have my way

82
00:02:53.866 --> 00:02:55.000
Retreat first

83
00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.500
This likes me, Ye Qingmei also retreats

84
00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:03.933
You are a member of Yunyin Sect

85
00:03:03.933 --> 00:03:05.400
Should understand what I'm saying

86
00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:06.466
What would you say?

87
00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.066
The legendary unicorn is the root of immortality

88
00:03:09.066 --> 00:03:10.100
Gods and Buddhas

89
00:03:10.133 --> 00:03:12.033
That's just an ethereal legend

90
00:03:12.066 --> 00:03:14.600
And the only person I'm looking for is not a genius

91
00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:15.666
Martial arts monster

92
00:03:15.733 --> 00:03:18.366
So I will quit this marriage if it is not sweet
