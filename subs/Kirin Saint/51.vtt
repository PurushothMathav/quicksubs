00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:02.900
I've been juggling my life, sitting up straight.

2
00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:06.166
You eight blessings say that I am a Jianghu god

3
00:00:06.166 --> 00:00:08.200
It's okay to be full of lies without me

4
00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:10.100
I can let it go.

5
00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:13.266
But nothing can take my dignity and bottom line

6
00:00:13.333 --> 00:00:15.066
Trample on the ground

7
00:00:15.266 --> 00:00:18.600
And your Heavenly Temple is the protection of the country and self-interest of Great Xia

8
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.500
It should be fair and objective to distinguish right from wrong

9
00:00:21.566 --> 00:00:23.000
Instead of hearing a few Xiao

10
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.800
The words of the younger generation

11
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.400
Then jump to a conclusion

12
00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.866
It's your own death

13
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:31.833
Lord Thunder

14
00:00:32.133 --> 00:00:34.666
Listen carefully to what this son has to say

15
00:00:34.666 --> 00:00:37.200
He is really openly provoking the entire Temple of Heaven

16
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.266
Now it seems

17
00:00:38.266 --> 00:00:39.866
This is not a natural or man-made disaster

18
00:00:40.133 --> 00:00:42.666
Is the result of his collusion with foreign enemies

19
00:00:42.666 --> 00:00:43.966
Go around, go around.

20
00:00:43.966 --> 00:00:45.833
I thought you were making this up

21
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:47.466
It's for financial gain.

22
00:00:47.466 --> 00:00:49.100
I didn't expect you to be a monster

23
00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.500
He actually took the country's Anhui as a revenge

24
00:00:51.766 --> 00:00:53.900
There's no cure.

25
00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:56.700
I will give you one last chance

26
00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:58.200
Roll down and be punished

27
00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.466
Otherwise, this God of War will not have your life with his bare hands

28
00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.900
I'll say it one last time

29
00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:06.800
They are present at disasters and counter-events on eight continents

30
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.333
It's all self-inflicted

31
00:01:08.333 --> 00:01:10.433
It has nothing to do with me

32
00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.166
I'm done talking.

33
00:01:13.166 --> 00:01:16.000
If your Heavenly Temple doesn't work again

34
00:01:16.066 --> 00:01:19.300
And I don't mind leaving you guys completely negative.
