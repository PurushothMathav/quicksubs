00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:01.400
Put steel plate

2
00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:04.066
His Highness Higawa is the head of our four evil emperors

3
00:00:04.166 --> 00:00:06.533
He is the only heir to the Sun God Society

4
00:00:06.533 --> 00:00:08.600
How dare you speak rudely in front of him

5
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:11.200
You are challenging the majesty of the entire Helios Society

6
00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.666
It was actually the legendary First Divine Society of Dongyang

7
00:00:13.666 --> 00:00:15.000
Helios

8
00:00:15.166 --> 00:00:17.400
Hahahaha

9
00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:21.600
Dare to be with you as long as it is our Sun God Society

10
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.300
What you want

11
00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.766
There is nothing you can't get

12
00:00:25.866 --> 00:00:28.333
You have to understand that.

13
00:00:28.333 --> 00:00:29.866
Then I'll give you a suggestion too.

14
00:00:29.866 --> 00:00:31.366
Your so-called Sun God Society

15
00:00:31.366 --> 00:00:33.300
It is better to change the sun model directly

16
00:00:33.733 --> 00:00:34.533
because

17
00:00:34.766 --> 00:00:37.766
Trash like you in the sewer

18
00:00:37.766 --> 00:00:39.833
Or is the toilet better for you?

19
00:00:40.066 --> 00:00:41.233
Uncle

20
00:00:41.566 --> 00:00:45.666
How dare you insult our Dongying Sun God Association?

21
00:00:45.666 --> 00:00:48.866
Right? How dare you insult us, His Highness Ganba?

22
00:00:48.866 --> 00:00:50.733
Believe it or not, I whored a prostitute and killed you

23
00:00:50.733 --> 00:00:54.066
Oops, can you shut up and smell like kimchi before talking?

24
00:00:54.066 --> 00:00:55.566
Throw it in the tank for you

25
00:00:55.933 --> 00:00:58.300
It's too good for me, Jinrui

26
00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.300
Xianhuang can't move

27
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.366
I must teach you a good lesson.

28
00:01:02.366 --> 00:01:06.366
My brother is a fool to change me to appease and judge you

29
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.900
I'm a fool haha

30
00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:12.933
Who gave you this name?

31
00:01:12.933 --> 00:01:15.366
Quack! What are you laughing at?

32
00:01:15.566 --> 00:01:18.866
Nothing, just a sudden memory of something happy

33
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.566
They are all very powerful

34
00:01:25.566 --> 00:01:27.233
Are you sure you're really sure?

35
00:01:28.766 --> 00:01:32.366
All of you, listen up.

36
00:01:32.366 --> 00:01:33.466
hero

37
00:01:33.733 --> 00:01:38.000
About to become a swordsman at the feet of my four-nation alliance

38
00:01:38.266 --> 00:01:42.233
No matter how much you resist, it's useless

39
00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:45.066
You'd better submit to us

40
00:01:45.066 --> 00:01:49.866
Or you will die without a burial

41
00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:52.666
Hahahahaha

42
00:01:52.666 --> 00:01:56.800
You based on your lowly big lower frame

43
00:01:57.133 --> 00:01:59.300
You are not bad looking

44
00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:03.966
Give you a chance to be my sitting bitch

45
00:02:03.966 --> 00:02:07.400
As long as you serve me well

46
00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:11.266
I promise I won't treat you badly.

47
00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:12.566
Pardon me?
