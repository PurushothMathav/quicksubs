00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:01.466
What's wrong with you?

2
00:00:01.466 --> 00:00:02.466
Mr. Lu is not good

3
00:00:02.466 --> 00:00:04.133
Dad, don't join forces to compensate us.

4
00:00:04.133 --> 00:00:05.166
Other colleagues value

5
00:00:05.166 --> 00:00:06.266
Don't think of a way

6
00:00:06.266 --> 00:00:07.833
We don't have more than three hours

7
00:00:07.933 --> 00:00:08.866
Not so

8
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:09.966
Be sure to keep it

9
00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:12.100
Make them worry

10
00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:13.800
Keep Wan Jing

11
00:00:14.266 --> 00:00:15.666
What do you daydream about?

12
00:00:15.666 --> 00:00:17.666
Didn't you just say that?

13
00:00:17.666 --> 00:00:20.800
How did I save you with what unicorn luck?

14
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.200
Then you ask him to save you again?

15
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:25.766
I want to see it too

16
00:00:25.766 --> 00:00:28.233
The so-called luck of the unicorn

17
00:00:28.366 --> 00:00:30.900
See if he can make your Mu family completely reverse

18
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:31.833
Heaven changes destiny

19
00:00:31.866 --> 00:00:34.300
So let's play a game

20
00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.100
I'll give you 10 seconds.

21
00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:37.266
Make you powerful

22
00:00:37.566 --> 00:00:38.933
10 seconds later

23
00:00:38.933 --> 00:00:40.700
My Xiao family will treat him with each other

24
00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.500
Make the final commercial crossing

25
00:00:42.666 --> 00:00:43.500
believe

26
00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.900
Your Mu family will be completely completed within half an hour

27
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.000
bankruptcy

28
00:00:49.866 --> 00:00:52.400
Why don't you dare to answer?

29
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.966
You eight clans are not only unrepentant

30
00:00:55.133 --> 00:00:56.433
Instead of the wrong family

31
00:00:56.533 --> 00:00:58.566
Provoking the unicorn threat again and again

32
00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.033
Are you really not afraid of karma?

33
00:01:01.733 --> 00:01:03.300
Eternal Doom

34
00:01:03.533 --> 00:01:05.300
What are you still packing?

35
00:01:05.733 --> 00:01:07.066
What broken money?

36
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.466
If there are soldiers

37
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:12.000
Then come to me
