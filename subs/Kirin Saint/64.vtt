00:00:01.133 --> 00:00:02.266
How could this be?

2
00:00:02.533 --> 00:00:03.333
Master

3
00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:05.866
Although Qingmei Mei manages her family well

4
00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:07.100
Caused the princes to commit suicide

5
00:00:07.566 --> 00:00:09.233
But his attacks on the battlefield

6
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:10.866
That's for real.

7
00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:12.700
You can't do it for a nobody

8
00:00:12.766 --> 00:00:15.000
Just deny all his achievements?

9
00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:19.400
I still have the heart to plead for others

10
00:00:19.766 --> 00:00:21.000
You four

11
00:00:21.266 --> 00:00:22.666
Recycle Ares Order

12
00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:23.900
Within a year

13
00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:25.966
It is not allowed to use the power of any god of war

14
00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:30.366
Come and apologize to His Holiness

15
00:00:30.466 --> 00:00:33.166
Then go back to the Temple of Heaven and destroy the four kingdoms

16
00:00:33.366 --> 00:00:34.166
Shi Ze

17
00:00:34.566 --> 00:00:37.166
I don't agree even if he's not fat

18
00:00:37.566 --> 00:00:40.466
It's a conflict at the bottom.

19
00:00:40.466 --> 00:00:42.066
He relied on

20
00:00:42.566 --> 00:00:44.166
It's priceless.

21
00:00:44.333 --> 00:00:47.033
Why did he press me Lei Tingfeng

22
00:00:47.366 --> 00:00:50.466
Why should he let me kneel down for him?

23
00:00:51.333 --> 00:00:53.000
I fought all my life

24
00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.366
Countless contributions

25
00:00:54.733 --> 00:00:56.500
It all depends on the treatment of the master

26
00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.200
Master made me face the wall and think

27
00:00:58.466 --> 00:01:01.433
No doubt but my knees are black

28
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.500
Never snakes for the weak

29
00:01:04.666 --> 00:01:06.266
So is my wolf

30
00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.566
He wants me to apologize to him

31
00:01:08.766 --> 00:01:10.366
What is it?

32
00:01:10.366 --> 00:01:11.733
A nest like this

33
00:01:11.733 --> 00:01:14.000
I just squeezed it to death. If it's not a thousand, it's eight hundred.

34
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.100
Why should he

35
00:01:17.166 --> 00:01:18.100
forget

36
00:01:18.933 --> 00:01:21.033
Kill him in one fell swoop

37
00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.200
Are you trying to piss off your deity?

38
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.000
Yes

39
00:01:25.866 --> 00:01:27.800
Is that just a redemption?

40
00:01:28.066 --> 00:01:30.600
No offense to you at all

41
00:01:32.666 --> 00:01:34.300
Why are you laughing?

42
00:01:35.066 --> 00:01:36.600
Why are you laughing?
