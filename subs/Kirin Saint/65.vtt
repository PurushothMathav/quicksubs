1
00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.266
You're still so stupid.

2
00:00:04.266 --> 00:00:05.766
This is worship.

3
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.233
There's no cure.

4
00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:08.600
Then you are the Buddha

5
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:11.133
What's so important about this kid?

6
00:00:11.133 --> 00:00:14.300
Don't tell him what kind of shit unicorn inheritor he is

7
00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:16.300
That kind of illusory legend

8
00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:18.100
I fooled you and my teachers

9
00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:19.633
Can't fool us

10
00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:21.400
decentralization

11
00:00:21.733 --> 00:00:24.666
Your disciples' ability to court death

12
00:00:24.733 --> 00:00:26.900
It really makes me sigh

13
00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:32.066
I'm more curious now. Can they go down to the tens?

14
00:00:32.766 --> 00:00:36.066
Survival Lord Li Tangxuan believers are powerless

15
00:00:36.066 --> 00:00:39.333
I would like to dedicate myself to the door today

16
00:00:39.333 --> 00:00:40.966
No. Why?

17
00:00:40.966 --> 00:00:44.066
I'm also curious where their confidence comes from

18
00:00:44.166 --> 00:00:45.400
Can hold up

19
00:00:45.866 --> 00:00:48.366
Since you put yourself in such a position of totalitarianism

20
00:00:48.366 --> 00:00:51.266
That's at least a peerless master who rules the world

21
00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.466
Then if you can take my punch

22
00:00:53.466 --> 00:00:56.600
I, Black Buddha, am willing to die today

23
00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:57.400
Black Buddha

24
00:00:58.266 --> 00:00:59.600
But what are you talking about?

25
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.533
If I didn't even have that confidence

26
00:01:01.533 --> 00:01:03.866
Then all these years of fighting on the battlefield will be for nothing

27
00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:05.900
I would like to add to the black talisman

28
00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.666
As long as this kid can connect to the army of the black talisman

29
00:01:08.666 --> 00:01:11.600
Then I will kneel down and apologize immediately

30
00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.766
I'm as greedy as labor

31
00:01:14.066 --> 00:01:17.933
Since our four major warriors are gambling

32
00:01:17.933 --> 00:01:21.100
Do you dare to take it or not?

33
00:01:21.666 --> 00:01:22.366
Don't worry.

34
00:01:22.366 --> 00:01:25.700
As long as the four warriors can take this opportunity to destroy

35
00:01:25.933 --> 00:01:28.000
Then the warrior is not a problem.

36
00:01:28.933 --> 00:01:30.966
Didn't you just say that you were very strict?

37
00:01:30.966 --> 00:01:33.766
Why can't even the God of War take a punch?

38
00:01:33.766 --> 00:01:36.066
Okay, this so-called bet

39
00:01:36.166 --> 00:01:39.033
You rape children when I'm too lazy to waste time with you.

40
00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.266
You go together
