00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:01.566
Xu Shaojie said slowly

2
00:00:01.566 --> 00:00:02.966
Our super factory and international

3
00:00:02.966 --> 00:00:04.000
The two major projects of the mine have been successively

4
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:04.700
After destruction

5
00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:06.266
All the investors have withdrawn

6
00:00:06.266 --> 00:00:08.200
And set off a chain reaction in the financial world

7
00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:10.866
Now our bank's stock has fallen by the limit

8
00:00:10.866 --> 00:00:11.666
What!

9
00:00:12.766 --> 00:00:13.800
You two

10
00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:17.066
Is it true what I said just 10 minutes ago?

11
00:00:17.133 --> 00:00:18.800
Yes, yes, it makes me so beautiful

12
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:23.000
What!

13
00:00:23.066 --> 00:00:26.766
The crisis in our Lu family broke out and went bankrupt

14
00:00:26.766 --> 00:00:29.866
The family ancestral hall of the Lu family was bombed

15
00:00:31.666 --> 00:00:35.900
God is going to kill my lobster

16
00:00:35.933 --> 00:00:38.866
You're kind of right.

17
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.300
Boss, what if you guess right?

18
00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.433
What if his Lu family goes bankrupt?

19
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.666
As long as Xiao Tianzi is there

20
00:00:47.666 --> 00:00:51.466
The Lu family can always get back on their feet

21
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:52.866
Make a comeback

22
00:00:53.066 --> 00:00:53.866
eliminate

23
00:00:54.333 --> 00:00:55.566
It's Xiao Shihao's general

24
00:00:55.666 --> 00:00:59.233
Come on, who allowed you Zhihu to hijack the road?

25
00:00:59.333 --> 00:01:01.900
Your grandfather asked me for business advice

26
00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:03.300
You're still playing anti-mud

27
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.600
You said it well, Xiao Shao

28
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.400
As long as my grandfather is still alive

29
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.766
Then the pillar of my Lu family will not be him.

30
00:01:10.766 --> 00:01:13.000
My Lu family will not collapse

31
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.666
That's right, it's been a big deal for so many years

32
00:01:16.766 --> 00:01:19.100
Our grandparents have broken through

33
00:01:19.133 --> 00:01:20.900
Bankrupt

34
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.466
What is it?

35
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.600
Set sail again

36
00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.700
Support for sales

37
00:01:26.966 --> 00:01:30.400
We will persevere for a lifetime

38
00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.633
What a pity.

39
00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:34.666
You don't have time

40
00:01:34.866 --> 00:01:36.166
Fart me early

41
00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.000
Grandpa, what's the matter with you?

42
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.566
Don't scare my grandpa

43
00:01:42.266 --> 00:01:43.066
Ah!

44
00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.000
Grandpa grandpa

45
00:01:45.166 --> 00:01:48.166
Grandpa, look at what happened to my grandfather

46
00:01:48.166 --> 00:01:48.966
Grandpa
