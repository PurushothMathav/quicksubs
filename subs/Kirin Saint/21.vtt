00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.766
Didn't he ask us to apologize to this broken unicorn?

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.266
Then we do as he wishes

3
00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:07.766
Wan will keep your eyes open

4
00:00:07.766 --> 00:00:10.933
See how we apologize

5
00:00:10.933 --> 00:00:13.800
I advise you not to play tricks

6
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.666
Kirin's patience is limited

7
00:00:17.733 --> 00:00:20.300
Really? Then I

8
00:00:20.566 --> 00:00:22.700
I'm too scary

9
00:00:23.866 --> 00:00:27.300
Mr. Lu, don't talk nonsense with him. What about this sword?

10
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.066
My white family will come first

11
00:00:30.333 --> 00:00:31.533
Give me the stuff

12
00:00:31.533 --> 00:00:33.400
Baiyuqiao, what are you doing?

13
00:00:43.866 --> 00:00:45.433
Do you know what's going on here?

14
00:00:45.466 --> 00:00:48.600
This black dog blood is used to expel the evil pulp

15
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:49.733
How can you come to offend

16
00:00:49.733 --> 00:00:51.300
What about the Holy Qilin who forced me to leave?

17
00:00:51.366 --> 00:00:54.166
Ah, I'm so sorry.

18
00:00:54.166 --> 00:00:57.233
I look at the unicorn, old and dirty

19
00:00:57.333 --> 00:00:59.066
Thinking of washing him with water?

20
00:00:59.066 --> 00:01:01.800
This looks like the wrong squat.

21
00:01:02.133 --> 00:01:04.766
But I did it on purpose.

22
00:01:04.766 --> 00:01:06.100
What can you do?

23
00:01:06.333 --> 00:01:08.233
What a divine beast?

24
00:01:08.366 --> 00:01:11.200
Give him a plate of dog blood to wake him up

25
00:01:11.333 --> 00:01:13.633
By the way, let me warn you

26
00:01:13.866 --> 00:01:15.466
Pretend to be in front of me again

27
00:01:15.466 --> 00:01:18.700
Your end will only be a hundred times worse than his

28
00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:24.100
Oh, dear.

29
00:01:26.166 --> 00:01:29.000
This is what you said, you're welcome.

30
00:01:29.733 --> 00:01:30.766
So bright

31
00:01:30.933 --> 00:01:34.600
I still think they are sincere hatchback

32
00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.600
Now it seems

33
00:01:36.766 --> 00:01:38.833
It's not a pile of rubble.

34
00:01:38.933 --> 00:01:44.200
As useless as you are

35
00:01:44.366 --> 00:01:46.866
Now we're done with kendo

36
00:01:46.866 --> 00:01:49.966
It's your turn to kneel for me
