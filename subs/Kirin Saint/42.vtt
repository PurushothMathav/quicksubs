00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:03.266
Hahahahaha what are you laughing at?

2
00:00:03.333 --> 00:00:04.066
I laugh at you

3
00:00:04.066 --> 00:00:06.266
Therefore, such a Heavenly Temple and Yunyin Sect

4
00:00:06.266 --> 00:00:09.700
From this point of view, it is just an ant that can be destroyed

5
00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:10.366
Laughing at you

6
00:00:10.366 --> 00:00:11.600
Obviously a dead end

7
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:14.133
But also set up content to force late

8
00:00:14.133 --> 00:00:16.333
It is a strong rise to your own

9
00:00:16.333 --> 00:00:19.400
In fact, General Mansion is in danger

10
00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.066
You are the lowest level of stairs here

11
00:00:22.066 --> 00:00:25.700
What qualifications do you have to judge our low status?

12
00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:28.566
Ah, then I'll tell you about the military parade today.

13
00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:30.700
My Identity

14
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.866
Mr. Zhou is finally going to unravel your identity

15
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.666
Please raise the throne of the Holy One

16
00:00:42.933 --> 00:00:45.300
Mr. Zhou please take a seat

17
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.733
Mr. Zhou please take a seat

18
00:00:48.733 --> 00:00:51.800
My full name is the Holy One

19
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.933
The business guests make the Qilin lucky above the clouds and clear clouds

20
00:00:54.933 --> 00:00:56.500
Cut off the evil sins of the world

21
00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.200
Bafangxian Demon Sword has no view of the scorching sun

22
00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:02.200
Thousands of scholars enter me like a mirror artifact

23
00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:06.333
Kirin return

24
00:01:06.333 --> 00:01:09.166
Hu Shi's million-dollar scourge will definitely be personally controlled

25
00:01:09.166 --> 00:01:11.366
A book that cares about Buddha
