1
00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.066
The wound that has been raised in this level for 20 years

2
00:00:02.066 --> 00:00:04.566
Charge today to recover and get out of trouble

3
00:00:04.733 --> 00:00:06.000
Whoever you are

4
00:00:06.066 --> 00:00:07.200
Leave quickly

5
00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:09.900
How many evil gods can you fight with this little deception?

6
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.166
Since you want to die

7
00:00:11.166 --> 00:00:13.500
Then perish with the hero

8
00:00:14.133 --> 00:00:17.066
Eight serpents crush them for me

9
00:00:24.933 --> 00:00:26.933
The evil god is angry and invincible

10
00:00:26.933 --> 00:00:28.733
I can't get back to you at all.

11
00:00:28.733 --> 00:00:30.166
Are we all

12
00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:31.800
Is that all?

13
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.333
He is the one who opened the king

14
00:00:34.333 --> 00:00:35.633
What nonsense are you talking about?

15
00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.500
This is the Holy Unicorn

16
00:00:42.866 --> 00:00:44.866
The Mighty Heavenly Might of the Holy Qilin

17
00:00:44.866 --> 00:00:47.066
You can take it.

18
00:01:00.466 --> 00:01:01.366
How is that possible?

19
00:01:01.366 --> 00:01:02.733
For thousands of years

20
00:01:02.733 --> 00:01:04.866
No one can obtain the inheritance of the Holy Qilin

21
00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:06.300
How did he manage it?

22
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.666
The legendary unicorn lucky man

23
00:01:08.666 --> 00:01:10.866
There are enemies in the world forever

24
00:01:10.866 --> 00:01:12.900
You can order all directions not to dare to obey

25
00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:13.700
called

26
00:01:14.466 --> 00:01:15.700
Kylin Sage

27
00:01:16.333 --> 00:01:18.266
You must find His Holiness

28
00:01:23.966 --> 00:01:25.233
Because only those 9 families

29
00:01:25.733 --> 00:01:27.100
I was trapped in prison for 20 years

30
00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.766
Now I can come out and smell the delicious taste of the world again

31
00:01:29.766 --> 00:01:31.633
It's so satisfying

32
00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.766
If it weren't for your 9 marriage contracts

33
00:01:34.866 --> 00:01:36.533
I haven't been so miserable all these years

34
00:01:36.533 --> 00:01:37.866
But one yard is one yard

35
00:01:37.866 --> 00:01:39.300
I'll go to your 9 houses later.

36
00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:41.066
Cancel these engagements

37
00:01:41.266 --> 00:01:42.700
Give you complete freedom

38
00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:44.200
We

39
00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.000
My Malatang

40
00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.733
You are we are your fiancÃ©e

41
00:02:12.733 --> 00:02:15.066
This time it will be looking for you in the future.

42
00:02:16.133 --> 00:02:17.033
divorce
