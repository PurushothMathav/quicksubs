00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:03.066
Somebody arrest them, you hear me?

2
00:00:03.066 --> 00:00:05.066
It's not too late for you to kneel and beg for mercy now

3
00:00:05.333 --> 00:00:07.433
Otherwise, it will be thrown out in a while.

4
00:00:07.966 --> 00:00:09.100
So embarrassing

5
00:00:09.133 --> 00:00:11.200
Master Ou, don't blame me

6
00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.966
This is the heroic end you brought upon yourself

7
00:00:13.966 --> 00:00:15.400
It's not bad to go to prison

8
00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:16.466
At least widely

9
00:00:16.466 --> 00:00:17.866
If you go back to Taoyuan County

10
00:00:17.866 --> 00:00:19.100
Where are your biological parents?

11
00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:22.166
I'm afraid I won't even be able to eat a full meal

12
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:23.566
Hahaha

13
00:00:24.166 --> 00:00:25.333
Oh, really!

14
00:00:25.333 --> 00:00:26.666
Is this the wrong person?

15
00:00:26.666 --> 00:00:27.933
How did you catch us?

16
00:00:27.933 --> 00:00:29.133
You fools

17
00:00:29.133 --> 00:00:30.533
You got the wrong guy, you know?

18
00:00:30.533 --> 00:00:31.166
Mrs. Li Xiao

19
00:00:31.166 --> 00:00:32.766
Are you mistaken?

20
00:00:32.766 --> 00:00:33.866
What's the misunderstanding?

21
00:00:33.866 --> 00:00:35.166
What are you still doing?

22
00:00:35.166 --> 00:00:37.600
Take them down and teach them a lesson

23
00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.500
Dare to make trouble at my birthday party

24
00:00:39.866 --> 00:00:41.166
You guys are tired of living

25
00:00:41.166 --> 00:00:42.533
Black old lady, you misunderstood

26
00:00:42.533 --> 00:00:43.866
The young master is making trouble

27
00:00:43.866 --> 00:00:45.200
Madam Leader, please let us go

28
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.133
Please forgive us.

29
00:00:46.133 --> 00:00:47.066
Why don't you admit it?

30
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.066
Yanyan, are you alright?

31
00:00:54.066 --> 00:00:56.933
It's okay my grandma

32
00:00:56.933 --> 00:00:58.200
How do you know?

33
00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:59.966
Ouch, it was a few days ago.

34
00:00:59.966 --> 00:01:01.666
I've been recuperating at the old house store

35
00:01:01.666 --> 00:01:03.500
And pass this sickness to you

36
00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.200
So I didn't see you.

37
00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.933
But your dad showed me your picture.

38
00:01:07.933 --> 00:01:10.000
How is your health now?

39
00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.333
It's okay, it's all old habits

40
00:01:12.333 --> 00:01:16.033
Hey, you've suffered a lot outside these years.
