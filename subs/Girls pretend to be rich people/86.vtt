00:00:05.133 --> 00:00:06.300
Want to try it on?

2
00:00:51.166 --> 00:00:53.333
Nice! Can I play a song for you, too?

3
00:00:53.333 --> 00:00:55.166
Mr. S also plays the piano

4
00:00:55.166 --> 00:00:56.466
Learned for a while

5
00:01:03.966 --> 00:01:06.466
Grandpa, this song is for you

6
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.400
Grandpa is 7 years old

7
00:01:09.866 --> 00:01:11.466
I finally had a chance

8
00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.666
Standing by your side upright

9
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.400
I'll give you this bullet

10
00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.166
Why can I learn from his piano music?

11
00:01:20.166 --> 00:01:22.066
Feel deep love

12
00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.600
Obviously we just met

13
00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:30.600
grandfather

14
00:01:32.666 --> 00:01:33.466
grandfather

15
00:01:34.866 --> 00:01:37.900
Mr. Su, have we met before?

16
00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:39.100
While in college

17
00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:40.533
I once liked a girl

18
00:01:40.533 --> 00:01:43.266
But in his eyes, there is only one other boy

19
00:01:43.266 --> 00:01:44.100
So

20
00:01:44.566 --> 00:01:47.066
I can only bury this love deep in my heart

21
00:01:47.366 --> 00:01:49.633
Accompany him for him

22
00:01:49.733 --> 00:01:51.600
I passed up the opportunity to study abroad

23
00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.266
Learned his favorite piano

24
00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.700
And I wrote him a lot of music.

25
00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.400
I didn't get a chance to play it for him until today.

26
00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.200
What does Siye Chen mean?

27
00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.766
Has he always liked me?

28
00:02:02.766 --> 00:02:04.066
How is that possible?
