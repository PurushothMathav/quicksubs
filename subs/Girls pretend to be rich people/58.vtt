00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:05.600
That's right.

2
00:00:08.333 --> 00:00:09.766
Thank you for saving my grandfather

3
00:00:09.766 --> 00:00:10.833
This is for you.

4
00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:12.100
Fill in the amount at will.

5
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.666
No need to lift your hand

6
00:00:15.333 --> 00:00:16.233
that

7
00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:18.666
Could I buy you a meal?

8
00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.866
You really don't have to be so polite, Mr. Dead

9
00:00:22.166 --> 00:00:23.933
If there is no indication at all

10
00:00:23.933 --> 00:00:25.500
My grandpa will blame me

11
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:28.866
Okay then. Hmm.

12
00:00:54.466 --> 00:00:57.566
Forgot your seat belt, thank you.

13
00:01:04.066 --> 00:01:05.000
Yanyan

14
00:01:05.133 --> 00:01:07.700
Today, Dad saw you with Fourth Young Master

15
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.466
Do you know each other?

16
00:01:09.533 --> 00:01:11.100
What's it to you?

17
00:01:11.533 --> 00:01:13.433
Just tell Dad the truth

18
00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.800
Did the Fourth Young Master take a fancy to you?

19
00:01:15.966 --> 00:01:17.166
Pursuit of you

20
00:01:17.333 --> 00:01:19.000
Oh, actually.

21
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.266
Can this fly to the branches to defend?

22
00:01:21.266 --> 00:01:22.666
And that's a good thing.

23
00:01:22.766 --> 00:01:23.900
But what?

24
00:01:23.966 --> 00:01:27.900
At least your mother's family, you have to be able to do it, right?

25
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.000
What do you mean?

26
00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.266
Your biological parents are in the country

27
00:01:31.266 --> 00:01:32.366
Forget about parents.

28
00:01:32.366 --> 00:01:34.500
It's just a joke

29
00:01:34.566 --> 00:01:36.200
Mom and Dad thought you were supportive

30
00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.133
Prepare a dowry for you

31
00:01:38.133 --> 00:01:41.466
Let you marry happily, right?
