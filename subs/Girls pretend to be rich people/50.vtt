00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:12.366
When did this old lady get this phone?

2
00:00:13.333 --> 00:00:15.666
This should be a gift from euros, right?

3
00:00:15.733 --> 00:00:18.166
Later, this dead girl didn't have a good heart

4
00:00:18.166 --> 00:00:19.900
It's not related to the old lady

5
00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:21.266
We were also kicked out of the Bai family

6
00:00:21.266 --> 00:00:22.966
And bought a cell phone for the old lady

7
00:00:23.533 --> 00:00:26.300
Must be trying to please the old lady's parents as a family property

8
00:00:27.666 --> 00:00:30.133
No wonder he didn't want to give him money before

9
00:00:30.133 --> 00:00:32.566
It turned out to be the idea of hitting our property

10
00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:37.833
Mom, you're awake

11
00:00:37.933 --> 00:00:39.266
We came to see you

12
00:00:39.366 --> 00:00:40.700
Grandma, you're awake

13
00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.500
This is what I cooked.

14
00:00:43.966 --> 00:00:45.966
No need, not busy.

15
00:00:45.966 --> 00:00:49.933
Ouch mom, is this a distant thought?

16
00:00:49.933 --> 00:00:52.000
Or have an ulterior motive

17
00:00:52.066 --> 00:00:54.566
Mom, where are you talking about?

18
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.300
Have you been in a coma for the past few days?

19
00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.500
We often come to see you.

20
00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.166
That's right, I've been a little busy with work recently.

21
00:01:01.166 --> 00:01:03.833
The stimulus chain at hand is out-point

22
00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.066
We'd like to ask you a favor.

23
00:01:07.066 --> 00:01:09.400
Take your little stake

24
00:01:09.866 --> 00:01:13.200
Don't you have shares yourself?

25
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.500
Oh my god

26
00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.133
If we sell our shares again

27
00:01:16.133 --> 00:01:18.766
This company is in the hands of outsiders

28
00:01:18.766 --> 00:01:20.066
What can be done then?

29
00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.833
If you don't have the ability

30
00:01:22.133 --> 00:01:23.400
Take the good stuff

31
00:01:23.466 --> 00:01:25.633
It's better to give it to someone else as soon as possible

32
00:01:26.333 --> 00:01:28.200
Don't wait for the company to go bankrupt

33
00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.700
I went underground.

34
00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:33.766
I can't explain it to our hunter and hare
