00:00:00.666 --> 00:00:03.266
Evidence, of course I have it

2
00:00:03.266 --> 00:00:05.433
Just before presenting the evidence

3
00:00:05.733 --> 00:00:07.466
I would like to ask Miss Bai

4
00:00:07.533 --> 00:00:09.666
The song you just played

5
00:00:09.866 --> 00:00:11.900
What does orgasm regret want to express?

6
00:00:12.133 --> 00:00:15.033
Of course it's a sad love song

7
00:00:15.133 --> 00:00:18.066
Just like the name he gave this song Zhou

8
00:00:18.266 --> 00:00:19.600
This is endless sadness

9
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.400
You want to break free

10
00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:22.466
But how to break free

11
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.800
Then you got it wrong.

12
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:26.766
If you don't believe me

13
00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.966
You can ask the others present.

14
00:00:29.266 --> 00:00:31.566
Hear the climax of this piece

15
00:00:31.566 --> 00:00:32.700
What does it feel like?

16
00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.766
And I heard intense sadness.

17
00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.666
Wrapped in a flood of sadness

18
00:00:39.166 --> 00:00:40.033
Tear

19
00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:48.300
Madam, there is a force pushing me

20
00:00:48.533 --> 00:00:50.933
Pull me to live well

21
00:00:50.933 --> 00:00:52.966
What I hear is from sadness

22
00:00:52.966 --> 00:00:55.066
Courage regained in despair

23
00:00:55.066 --> 00:00:55.966
And power

24
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.066
The image that comes to my mind is of last year's illness

25
00:00:59.066 --> 00:01:00.866
Everybody's united.

26
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.300
I am also a picture of despair and well-being

27
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.833
Aviation is right in front of me

28
00:01:05.066 --> 00:01:07.033
That is a war without gunpowder smoke

29
00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:08.066
Exactly.

30
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:09.800
Last year's hell

31
00:01:10.333 --> 00:01:11.866
Lost countless families

32
00:01:11.866 --> 00:01:14.400
Makes countless people envious and sad

33
00:01:14.866 --> 00:01:17.766
And that's how I created my vision.

34
00:01:18.333 --> 00:01:20.000
Hope for the power of music

35
00:01:20.066 --> 00:01:22.366
Can bring them warm hope

36
00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.000
I wish you all the best

37
00:01:26.333 --> 00:01:27.600
people's well-being

38
00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.600
Everyone understands music differently

39
00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.133
You can't because of this

40
00:01:32.133 --> 00:01:33.466
Just say I copied you

41
00:01:33.466 --> 00:01:35.300
You have replaced my eyes

42
00:01:35.333 --> 00:01:37.600
Enjoyed 20 years of glory and wealth

43
00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.800
My parents finally found me who was wandering outside

44
00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:42.900
You just don't accept it.

45
00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:44.600
That's why you keep targeting me

46
00:01:44.666 --> 00:01:47.233
You dislike the poverty of your original family.

47
00:01:47.366 --> 00:01:49.233
I want to stay reserved

48
00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.366
So I go out with a different man every day.

49
00:01:52.366 --> 00:01:53.800
I am your sister

50
00:01:53.866 --> 00:01:57.166
I tried my best to persuade you over and over again, but you didn't listen.

51
00:01:57.866 --> 00:02:00.033
He's been targeting me and my fiancÃ©

52
00:02:00.733 --> 00:02:02.833
It was originally thought that we were a rich and prosperous lady

53
00:02:05.333 --> 00:02:06.800
You actually slandered me
