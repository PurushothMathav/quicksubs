00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:02.233
Is it really you?

2
00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:05.266
Yangyang won the second place in the National Piano Competition

3
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:06.733
We are here to celebrate

4
00:00:06.733 --> 00:00:08.466
I just opened the card.

5
00:00:09.533 --> 00:00:10.766
Report Takako

6
00:00:11.066 --> 00:00:13.400
Play together if you have time

7
00:00:14.266 --> 00:00:15.433
Hey stop

8
00:00:16.666 --> 00:00:18.366
Over there is the top box

9
00:00:18.566 --> 00:00:20.066
What were you doing there?

10
00:00:20.266 --> 00:00:22.400
Are you here to eat?

11
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:23.700
What else can you do?

12
00:00:23.933 --> 00:00:26.133
If you have a brain problem, take more medicine

13
00:00:26.133 --> 00:00:27.700
Don't come out to get off work

14
00:00:28.166 --> 00:00:29.133
Top Box

15
00:00:29.133 --> 00:00:31.000
The recharge amount should reach more than 10 million

16
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.466
Make an appointment in advance

17
00:00:32.466 --> 00:00:34.233
I can't even get in. What qualifications do you have?

18
00:00:34.866 --> 00:00:37.400
If you can't get in, it means you belong to the rose.

19
00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:40.766
Oh, yeah.

20
00:00:41.133 --> 00:00:43.866
Did you do something shameful?

21
00:00:43.866 --> 00:00:45.666
The top delusion that just went

22
00:00:45.766 --> 00:00:47.200
Even if I do

23
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.833
You can't give in to that either.

24
00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.366
Gao Yang, turn your head

25
00:00:52.666 --> 00:00:55.466
Turn your head around

26
00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:02.266
What's the matter? Did you hear the sound of water?

27
00:01:02.366 --> 00:01:04.500
How dare you scold me

28
00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.133
The brain is flooded twice

29
00:01:06.133 --> 00:01:07.666
I really can't tell how to export it.

30
00:01:08.566 --> 00:01:09.600
Hey you

31
00:01:10.566 --> 00:01:11.366
Hey

32
00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:14.733
Do you have any other dishes to add?

33
00:01:14.733 --> 00:01:15.533
That's enough!

34
00:01:19.866 --> 00:01:22.366
Brother Gao, why did you go for so long?

35
00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.233
I just saw Ouyan.

36
00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:25.900
He actually went to the top box

37
00:01:25.966 --> 00:01:28.800
Sister, why did he go to the top box?

38
00:01:29.166 --> 00:01:32.266
He estimated that he would not go to the top box to serve the adults

39
00:01:32.533 --> 00:01:34.266
Why is he doing it so many times now?

40
00:01:34.866 --> 00:01:36.833
Brother, don't be angry just now.

41
00:01:36.866 --> 00:01:39.300
Sister, this may be because I have been too sleepy recently.

42
00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:40.900
So I can only do these jobs.

43
00:01:40.966 --> 00:01:43.466
Why don't we introduce him to something else?

44
00:01:43.466 --> 00:01:45.300
Forget it. Leave him alone.

45
00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.466
Love to do this to yourself and let him go
