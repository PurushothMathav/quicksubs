00:00:06.566 --> 00:00:07.533
Hello big brother

2
00:00:07.533 --> 00:00:09.966
The little sister has already taken the land.

3
00:00:09.966 --> 00:00:12.800
Tossed the shares I have bought dishes are now in

4
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.000
You can give me 25% next time.

5
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Thank you, big brother.

6
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.466
You're welcome with big brother

7
00:00:23.066 --> 00:00:25.066
Is it bad for Mr. Bai?

8
00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:26.700
What's the matter?

9
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:28.266
The land we photographed before

10
00:00:28.266 --> 00:00:29.866
You must gamble within a month

11
00:00:29.966 --> 00:00:32.266
And no trading is allowed for 5 years

12
00:00:32.266 --> 00:00:34.000
It can become a mortgage loan for banks

13
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.166
Pardon me?

14
00:00:35.366 --> 00:00:37.000
Is this accurate?

15
00:00:37.366 --> 00:00:39.666
We don't have a penny in our hands right now.

16
00:00:39.666 --> 00:00:42.900
I still hope to turn around by selling this land

17
00:00:42.933 --> 00:00:45.466
This is not allowed to be bought or sold for 5 years now

18
00:00:45.666 --> 00:00:47.900
Then we owe the bank so much interest

19
00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:49.766
That's a million dollars a month.

20
00:00:49.766 --> 00:00:50.466
What should I do?

21
00:00:50.466 --> 00:00:52.233
Who said that?

22
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:53.433
True or False

23
00:00:54.366 --> 00:00:55.700
Did you ask clearly?

24
00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:56.933
Ask clearly

25
00:00:56.933 --> 00:00:58.733
Other companies know about this.

26
00:00:58.733 --> 00:00:59.066
So

27
00:00:59.066 --> 00:01:01.333
The people who came to participate in the auction this time are all first-tier companies

28
00:01:01.333 --> 00:01:03.000
Only they have spare money

29
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.500
Even if you hold this land in your hands for 5 years

30
00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.300
It doesn't really matter to them.

31
00:01:07.966 --> 00:01:09.700
What about the shock?

32
00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:10.733
Such a large piece of land

33
00:01:10.733 --> 00:01:12.666
How can we have spare money to start work?

34
00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.666
And the interest the bank owes

35
00:01:14.933 --> 00:01:17.300
Why don't we pay it back?

36
00:01:17.666 --> 00:01:18.866
What can we do about this?

37
00:01:18.933 --> 00:01:20.200
If the Gao family knew

38
00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.133
What about my engagement party with the Gao family?

39
00:01:22.133 --> 00:01:22.933
Gaojia

40
00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.200
Remember this message

41
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.966
Don't let the Gao family know

42
00:01:27.133 --> 00:01:29.433
Your engagement party with Gao Yang must be held

43
00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.866
Mr. Bai has one more thing

44
00:01:33.066 --> 00:01:34.200
Why are you hesitating?

45
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:34.866
Say it

46
00:01:34.866 --> 00:01:37.366
You asked me to investigate the old lady's will before

47
00:01:37.366 --> 00:01:40.200
I found out that the old lady put all the inheritance

48
00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.000
Leave it all to my grandfather
