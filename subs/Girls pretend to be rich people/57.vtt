00:00:01.966 --> 00:00:03.866
Grandpa, we're here to see you

2
00:00:03.866 --> 00:00:04.666
4 Hello Grandpa

3
00:00:04.666 --> 00:00:08.400
Are you the little girl who saved me?

4
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:09.966
Ok come come come

5
00:00:14.966 --> 00:00:17.500
Grandpa, thank you

6
00:00:17.666 --> 00:00:18.933
If it weren't for you

7
00:00:18.933 --> 00:00:21.300
My old bones can be explained

8
00:00:21.933 --> 00:00:24.400
No, Fourth Grandpa, you are very lucky

9
00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.766
It will definitely live a hundred years, hahahaha.

10
00:00:28.333 --> 00:00:29.900
This brat

11
00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:31.900
Staring at the little girl

12
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
I seem to like him

13
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.066
Grandpa

14
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.366
I take the liberty to ask

15
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.366
Do you have a boyfriend?

16
00:00:40.866 --> 00:00:42.800
Ah, no.

17
00:00:45.066 --> 00:00:47.466
So what do you think of my grandson?

18
00:00:48.866 --> 00:00:49.666
Ah!

19
00:00:50.466 --> 00:00:51.766
Look at my grandson

20
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.900
Tall and handsome!

21
00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:55.100
young and promising

22
00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.766
And he's a billionaire.

23
00:00:57.766 --> 00:01:00.166
Would you like to think about it?

24
00:01:01.566 --> 00:01:02.766
Uh uh

25
00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:07.100
4 Grandpa, I have no plans to fall in love for the time being

26
00:01:07.266 --> 00:01:10.100
Can you make friends without falling in love?

27
00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.433
Grandpa, don't make it difficult for others

28
00:01:13.066 --> 00:01:14.833
How is this embarrassing for people?

29
00:01:15.533 --> 00:01:17.266
Mr. Yang, so

30
00:01:17.866 --> 00:01:20.600
You two leave each other WeChat messages?

31
00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.200
He's the president of the conglomerate.

32
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.433
If you have anything in the future, just go to him

33
00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:27.566
Is that okay?

34
00:01:28.933 --> 00:01:29.733
OK

35
00:01:30.066 --> 00:01:30.866
OK

36
00:01:34.366 --> 00:01:35.466
Uh fourth grandpa

37
00:01:35.466 --> 00:01:36.900
I'll take a call uh

38
00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.933
Fourth grandpa, let me take a call

39
00:01:38.933 --> 00:01:41.266
Okay, okay, you go pick it up, let's go

40
00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:46.366
Okay, okay.

41
00:01:46.466 --> 00:01:47.566
Look no further.

42
00:01:48.166 --> 00:01:48.966
OK

43
00:01:49.466 --> 00:01:50.700
You like grandpa?

44
00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:51.500
i

45
00:01:51.966 --> 00:01:53.800
Grandpa is a good girl

46
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.300
I like it here too.

47
00:01:56.366 --> 00:01:58.600
If you can catch up to him

48
00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.100
I promise you that I will run away from home

49
00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.766
Grandpa's a deal, a deal

50
00:02:06.333 --> 00:02:07.366
4 grandpa

51
00:02:07.533 --> 00:02:10.733
It's getting late, so I won't disturb your rest.

52
00:02:10.733 --> 00:02:12.066
I'll see you another day.

53
00:02:12.066 --> 00:02:14.433
Okay, okay, then you will be free in the future.

54
00:02:15.466 --> 00:02:17.066
Come and see you often

55
00:02:17.066 --> 00:02:18.833
I'll send it to you.

56
00:02:18.966 --> 00:02:20.466
No need.

57
00:02:20.466 --> 00:02:22.066
You let him sit

58
00:02:22.066 --> 00:02:24.066
Let him sit and he'll be fine

59
00:02:24.866 --> 00:02:26.400
Chen is a child
