00:00:00.866 --> 00:00:02.100
What do you want?

2
00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:02.900
Oh, dear.

3
00:00:02.933 --> 00:00:06.733
I heard that this Si Shao has a good relationship with the Li family

4
00:00:06.733 --> 00:00:09.200
Can you make Si Shao in front of the Li family?

5
00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.066
Say a few nice words

6
00:00:11.066 --> 00:00:13.533
Let the Li family continue to cooperate with us

7
00:00:13.533 --> 00:00:16.466
Or let Si Shao cooperate with us

8
00:00:16.666 --> 00:00:18.000
Can't do it

9
00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:19.066
Grandpa

10
00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:21.300
Dad worked so hard to raise you so big

11
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.533
Now the company is in trouble

12
00:00:23.533 --> 00:00:25.066
Can you stand by and watch?

13
00:00:25.066 --> 00:00:27.166
The person who raised me was my grandmother

14
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.133
Have you paid a penny over the years?

15
00:00:29.133 --> 00:00:31.100
Come back and see me

16
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.333
Dad has been busy making money

17
00:00:33.333 --> 00:00:35.500
It's really involuntary, you just

18
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.866
Let me know if you need help

19
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.400
Thank you, Mr. Su.

20
00:00:43.466 --> 00:00:46.100
Nonsense, this damn girl is really an Aries brain

21
00:00:46.133 --> 00:00:47.800
We raised him for so many years

22
00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.700
He doesn't care about old relationships at all

23
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:51.766
I told you.

24
00:00:51.866 --> 00:00:53.533
Let you be nice to him at ordinary times

25
00:00:53.533 --> 00:00:55.000
Don't be so embarrassed?

26
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.966
Okay now, just be nice to him

27
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.266
If there is a problem now, you can return it to me.

28
00:01:00.466 --> 00:01:02.300
Bai Zhenghan, are you still a man?

29
00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:03.100
you

30
00:01:03.733 --> 00:01:04.566
Mom

31
00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.500
Don't be angry, sister, there will definitely be a way.

32
00:01:08.533 --> 00:01:09.333
Aegean

33
00:01:10.733 --> 00:01:12.566
Mrs. Wang, why are you here?

34
00:01:12.566 --> 00:01:13.633
Please take a seat

35
00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.066
Yaoyao haha

36
00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:17.233
Aegean

37
00:01:17.566 --> 00:01:19.900
You and Zhenhai are too low-key, right?

38
00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:20.500
This far

39
00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.900
Winning second place in the National Piano Competition

40
00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:24.433
Don't you tell me

41
00:01:24.466 --> 00:01:26.766
It's so big that it's hidden, isn't it?
