1
00:00:15.766 --> 00:00:16.833
It's all my fault

2
00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:20.100
I didn't watch it earlier.

3
00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.566
If you put it down sooner

4
00:00:23.733 --> 00:00:25.966
Then he won't die

5
00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:27.600
yuanyuan

6
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.700
You've done enough.

7
00:00:35.133 --> 00:00:37.000
No matter what people say tonight

8
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:41.700
Dear relatives and friends

9
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.500
Today is the wedding day of my engagement to Yaoyao

10
00:00:44.566 --> 00:00:46.000
Thank you for taking your time.

11
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.300
Make time for our engagement party

12
00:00:48.366 --> 00:00:49.966
Prepare some chives today

13
00:00:49.966 --> 00:00:51.400
So please have a drink.

14
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.200
If there is any poor hospitality

15
00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.366
Please also Haihan

16
00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:59.433
What the hell?

17
00:01:00.266 --> 00:01:02.200
Today is my son's first day

18
00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:03.433
You laugh too

19
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.266
It was a joke.

20
00:01:05.266 --> 00:01:08.766
My son married this man to something on stage

21
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.266
What a loss

22
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.100
If it weren't for Bai Jia patrolling half of the subway

23
00:01:14.733 --> 00:01:17.600
They won't agree to lend us a high price at all

24
00:01:17.766 --> 00:01:18.866
An engagement party.

25
00:01:19.166 --> 00:01:20.433
Spent hundreds of millions

26
00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.000
We don't lose money

27
00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.800
The big deal is that we will not borrow it in the future

28
00:01:27.166 --> 00:01:28.033
What you said

29
00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.600
Let's give it a big hand.

30
00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.000
The most sincere wishes.

31
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.433
Witness two newlyweds exchanging rings

32
00:01:40.933 --> 00:01:43.300
Brother Kai, do you miss me?

33
00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:48.800
Yuck!

34
00:01:49.666 --> 00:01:53.866
Brother Kai, let's change positions and go home
