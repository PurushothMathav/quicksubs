1
00:00:10.133 --> 00:00:11.666
You offended Mr. Li

2
00:00:11.866 --> 00:00:13.300
Make us lose the project

3
00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:14.533
What are you doing here?

4
00:00:14.533 --> 00:00:16.800
Do you still think we haven't suffered enough?

5
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.400
I offended Mr. Li

6
00:00:19.133 --> 00:00:20.966
Just brains like yours

7
00:00:21.266 --> 00:00:23.666
So stupid listen to me tell you

8
00:00:23.666 --> 00:00:26.600
What the hell are you talking to me?

9
00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.033
I have no relationship with the Bai family now

10
00:00:29.333 --> 00:00:30.633
The house is just

11
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:32.466
How do I raise it?

12
00:00:32.466 --> 00:00:33.800
You can't do this

13
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.900
There is time to deliver after doing business requirements

14
00:00:37.966 --> 00:00:38.766
Right

15
00:00:39.066 --> 00:00:41.833
We're also going to your old lady's birthday party

16
00:00:42.133 --> 00:00:44.266
Hmph, even if it is a phoenix today

17
00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:47.733
Don't make any moths for me later

18
00:00:47.733 --> 00:00:49.500
Otherwise, I could have let you go

19
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.266
Xiao Ou, I'm also here to smoke today

20
00:00:52.266 --> 00:00:53.066
delay

21
00:00:53.466 --> 00:00:55.166
Today is Mrs. Li's hand

22
00:00:55.166 --> 00:00:58.100
Cigarettes are not just random cigarettes for cats and dogs

23
00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.433
Just cats and dogs like you

24
00:01:01.866 --> 00:01:04.900
If so, I'll feed a kitten and a puppy

25
00:01:05.166 --> 00:01:08.000
Just like you, you can grab anything that is inferior to pigs and dogs.

26
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.300
Why can't I call myself a girl?

27
00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:11.100
Hey

28
00:01:11.766 --> 00:01:12.566
uncle

29
00:01:12.933 --> 00:01:15.300
You left the Bai family with nothing

30
00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:17.266
It's just a joke

31
00:01:18.533 --> 00:01:21.566
I went to great lengths to get 4

32
00:01:22.566 --> 00:01:24.000
Can you get it?

33
00:01:24.766 --> 00:01:26.266
What else do I have?

34
00:01:26.266 --> 00:01:27.066
Also say

35
00:01:27.933 --> 00:01:29.666
He doesn't really have an invitation, does he?

36
00:01:29.666 --> 00:01:30.400
That's impossible.

37
00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:33.000
Those invited away from home are all military leaders with faces

38
00:01:33.133 --> 00:01:34.800
I went to great lengths to get it.

39
00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.433
How could he possibly do it these years?

40
00:01:37.266 --> 00:01:39.400
Brother, let's go help my sister.

41
00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.300
He deserves it if he gets pulled over by security and kicked out

42
00:01:44.466 --> 00:01:45.900
How could this be?
