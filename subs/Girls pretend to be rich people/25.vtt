00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.466
Dad, I think my sister has a special relationship with Mr. Li

2
00:00:03.466 --> 00:00:05.500
But what are they?

3
00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:07.800
Yes, that dead man Ou Yan

4
00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.966
How could it be possible to send Mr. Li's concern?

5
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.100
The euro just called that person big brother.

6
00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:13.100
He is definitely not Mr. Li

7
00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:14.666
It must be Ou Yan sent to act

8
00:00:14.733 --> 00:00:16.733
What does Chen Tezhu say now?

9
00:00:16.733 --> 00:00:18.966
We offended people we shouldn't have offended

10
00:00:18.966 --> 00:00:20.200
Could it be the euro?

11
00:00:20.333 --> 00:00:21.766
Okay, it's the countdown of the group, right?

12
00:00:21.766 --> 00:00:22.566
You're right actually.

13
00:00:22.566 --> 00:00:25.400
This damn girl also blames us for being blind in the first place

14
00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:26.566
I raised him so big

15
00:00:26.566 --> 00:00:29.200
Dad, the most important thing for us is to hurry up

16
00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:30.133
Mr. Li apologizes

17
00:00:30.133 --> 00:00:31.133
You're right actually.

18
00:00:31.133 --> 00:00:33.766
Now we're going back to prep care and go to lawyers

19
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:35.333
Oops that

20
00:00:35.333 --> 00:00:37.933
There will be an auction at the Kims this afternoon

21
00:00:37.933 --> 00:00:38.800
At auction

22
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.466
There are paintings by Mr. Li's favorite painter, Dawn

23
00:00:41.466 --> 00:00:43.366
If you take a picture of this painting

24
00:00:43.366 --> 00:00:45.700
Then Mr. Li may forgive us for the past?

25
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:48.633
Okay, let's go shoot the painting of Dawn
