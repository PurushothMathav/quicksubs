00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:01.566
Isn't grandpa's condition getting better?

2
00:00:01.566 --> 00:00:02.700
Why did it relapse?

3
00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.766
The fourth brother can't drag the hospital

4
00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:06.833
Stop the illness and suddenly break the law

5
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.666
It's not like a little girl arrived in time

6
00:00:08.666 --> 00:00:09.666
Called an ambulance

7
00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:12.200
I just applied for you to check who that person is.

8
00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.000
Answer well thank you yes

9
00:00:20.466 --> 00:00:21.500
Wake up wake up

10
00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.100
Grandma is awake

11
00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.033
What's wrong with me?

12
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:28.366
Grandpa, how is your body?

13
00:00:28.366 --> 00:00:30.000
You still don't know it yourself?

14
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.366
Why did you sneak out of the hospital?

15
00:00:31.366 --> 00:00:33.066
What if something happens?

16
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.700
I've been in the hospital for a week

17
00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:39.566
I feel like I'm moldy, Ah Chen

18
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.833
I heard that my biological daughter who left home is back

19
00:00:45.133 --> 00:00:46.800
He's your fiancee

20
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.600
When will you bring it back to meet me?

21
00:00:49.933 --> 00:00:50.900
No problem.

22
00:00:50.966 --> 00:00:51.766
you

23
00:00:52.066 --> 00:00:53.800
Are you trying to piss me off?

24
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.566
I don't care about anti-war

25
00:00:56.066 --> 00:00:58.000
You must marry the daughter of the Li family

26
00:00:58.366 --> 00:01:01.700
Otherwise, how can I explain it to others?

27
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:02.800
Grandpa

28
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.933
The daughter of the Li family has been living outside for so many years

29
00:01:04.933 --> 00:01:05.900
Just got it back

30
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.566
Don't say

31
00:01:06.566 --> 00:01:08.333
There is no love between the two of us at all

32
00:01:08.333 --> 00:01:10.100
I don't even know what kind of person he is.

33
00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:11.766
How could I possibly marry her?

34
00:01:11.766 --> 00:01:13.233
emotion emotion

35
00:01:13.333 --> 00:01:15.566
Can feelings be cultivated?

36
00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:16.833
No emotion
