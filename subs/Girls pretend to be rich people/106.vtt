00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:01.800
Hey, how could you hit my daughter?

2
00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:02.866
I want to be a bitch

3
00:00:02.866 --> 00:00:04.800
Let me give everyone a good look at you

4
00:00:04.866 --> 00:00:05.966
You are an asshole

5
00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:08.333
You bitch

6
00:00:08.333 --> 00:00:10.566
Look at me today, you ugly face

7
00:00:11.133 --> 00:00:12.600
Don't you want people to see it?

8
00:00:13.133 --> 00:00:16.033
Have a good day today, everyone, look at you country man

9
00:00:17.566 --> 00:00:19.800
Ah, leave you obviously a dust

10
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.633
Everything is fine.

11
00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.666
I didn't expect Xue Yaqi to be so vicious

12
00:00:23.733 --> 00:00:24.866
What a beast

13
00:00:24.866 --> 00:00:26.500
Even the elderly are not spared

14
00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.266
You are so irritating

15
00:00:32.266 --> 00:00:33.066
This

16
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.700
Please listen to my explanation.

17
00:00:35.733 --> 00:00:38.900
Ah, this white old lady

18
00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:41.033
Could it have been killed by Xu Aiqin?

19
00:00:42.533 --> 00:00:46.300
How can grandma be missing such a big good thing in the Bai family?

20
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.033
Sure enough, you missed it.

21
00:00:51.166 --> 00:00:53.300
I knew it all

22
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.200
It's all your fault

23
00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.000
Well, today is your sister's engagement party

24
00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.900
You summon male etiquette

25
00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:01.533
You're cursing your sister

26
00:01:01.533 --> 00:01:03.200
Still cursing your grandma

27
00:01:03.533 --> 00:01:06.866
If the person dies, you should take care of it.

28
00:01:06.866 --> 00:01:08.100
Stop talking nonsense

29
00:01:08.366 --> 00:01:09.700
What happened to your grandma?

30
00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.266
If he is resuscitated in the hospital

31
00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:12.666
After the wedding reception is over

32
00:01:12.666 --> 00:01:14.066
We'll go see him right away

33
00:01:14.066 --> 00:01:16.066
You don't have to take a picture of your grandmother

34
00:01:16.066 --> 00:01:17.166
Move out and scare us

35
00:01:17.166 --> 00:01:18.900
You saw the posthumous photos

36
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.966
Shouldn't you come over and repent?

37
00:01:20.966 --> 00:01:23.666
After all, it was you who killed
