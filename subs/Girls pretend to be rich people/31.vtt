00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:01.100
Congratulations, uncle!

2
00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:02.300
Leaving home to see this painting

3
00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:04.200
I will definitely continue to cooperate with the Bai family.

4
00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.366
It's all Ohne's fault

5
00:00:06.366 --> 00:00:07.433
If not for him

6
00:00:07.466 --> 00:00:09.266
How can we spend so much money?

7
00:00:11.266 --> 00:00:12.266
Hey wait

8
00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:17.300
This is the lady in the heart of the ocean.

9
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:18.500
The Heart of the Ocean

10
00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:20.266
It is also one of the products in today's auction.

11
00:00:20.266 --> 00:00:21.333
Why isn't it on display?

12
00:00:21.333 --> 00:00:23.200
This was decided in advance by the eldest young master who left home

13
00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:24.600
Sent away from home

14
00:00:26.366 --> 00:00:27.266
This Li Jia daughter

15
00:00:27.266 --> 00:00:29.966
Didn't you disappear when you were born as a child?

16
00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:32.200
Did you find it again?

17
00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:33.833
It has nothing to do with our family anyway

18
00:00:33.966 --> 00:00:37.033
Hurry up and go to the death group to find Mr. Li

19
00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.733
Yeah, that's right.

20
00:00:37.733 --> 00:00:39.066
I'm going now

21
00:00:42.933 --> 00:00:45.166
Hello, let me meet your Mr. Li

22
00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.033
Do you have a reservation?

23
00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:48.200
No reservation

24
00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.300
But I have something very important

25
00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:51.800
Please take me to meet you

26
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.600
Sorry, I can't pick it up without an appointment.

27
00:00:54.966 --> 00:00:56.566
Do you know who I am?

28
00:00:56.566 --> 00:00:57.500
You Mr. Li

29
00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.766
Gave me a billion dollars' worth of jokes.

30
00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.600
Can you afford to delay me?

31
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:03.400
OK

32
00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:06.200
Does Mr. Chen Dazhu want to see Mr. Li?
