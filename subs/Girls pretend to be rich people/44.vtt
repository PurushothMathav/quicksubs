00:00:00.566 --> 00:00:01.866
No, Grandma.

2
00:00:01.866 --> 00:00:03.966
The Bai family loves money like life

3
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.166
Big brother just cancelled their cooperation.

4
00:00:06.166 --> 00:00:08.233
They're deliberately annoyed now

5
00:00:08.266 --> 00:00:09.800
What kind of punishment is that?

6
00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:12.033
Grandma, today is your feast

7
00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:14.600
I don't want to affect your mood because of those people.

8
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.900
OK, then grandma will listen to you

9
00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:17.466
Grandma

10
00:00:17.466 --> 00:00:20.400
For your sake, let Baijia go once

11
00:00:20.466 --> 00:00:23.400
Grandma, I want to go to the bathroom

12
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.566
Go, go.

13
00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:29.500
Yanyan this child

14
00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:30.766
well-behaved and sensible

15
00:00:30.766 --> 00:00:33.066
I suffered a lot of grievances in the Bai family before

16
00:00:33.066 --> 00:00:34.200
It's back now.

17
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.266
You have to treat her well, don't worry, Mom.

18
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.266
Grandpa is our heart

19
00:00:39.266 --> 00:00:40.233
Don't worry, grandma.

20
00:00:40.266 --> 00:00:42.133
We will definitely protect our little sister as well.

21
00:00:42.133 --> 00:00:43.600
Since Yanyan is back

22
00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.666
Then our engagement with the private person?

23
00:00:45.666 --> 00:00:47.000
It should be on the agenda

24
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.566
Today is Mom's birthday party

25
00:00:48.733 --> 00:00:49.866
Is Ah Cheng here?

26
00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.500
Why don't you introduce them to each other first?

27
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.200
I heard that the brain has been sick all the time.

28
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.066
Ah Cheng was called away

29
00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.033
Then another day I will take Yanyan to see Mr. Si Lao

30
00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:02.066
By the way, let Ah Cheng and Yanyan get in touch first

31
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.566
What's the matter with Li Jiaren?

32
00:01:07.566 --> 00:01:09.100
We didn't offend him.

33
00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:10.933
Why did he throw us out together?

34
00:01:10.933 --> 00:01:12.166
Kick us out

35
00:01:12.533 --> 00:01:14.166
Are you still looking for someone to please?

36
00:01:14.933 --> 00:01:17.566
Yes, it was obviously my sister who took off the necklace.

37
00:01:17.566 --> 00:01:19.366
But why didn't my sister feel emotional?
