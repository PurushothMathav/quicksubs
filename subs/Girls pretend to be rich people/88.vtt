1
00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:01.933
Nope.

2
00:00:01.933 --> 00:00:04.900
From the moment I saw him with Cypress Mumiao

3
00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:07.800
I'm done with him

4
00:00:09.866 --> 00:00:11.900
Can't that be me?

5
00:00:12.666 --> 00:00:14.500
Mr. S, I told you

6
00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:16.800
I have no plans to start a new relationship right now

7
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.366
Again

8
00:00:18.966 --> 00:00:21.033
Don't you already have a fiancÃ©e?

9
00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:23.133
I don't have the wrong hobby to insert other people's feelings

10
00:00:23.133 --> 00:00:24.666
I do have a fiancee

11
00:00:24.666 --> 00:00:25.933
But it was made at home

12
00:00:25.933 --> 00:00:27.533
I've never even met his face.

13
00:00:27.533 --> 00:00:29.966
And grandpa has promised me that I can get rid of the marriage.

14
00:00:29.966 --> 00:00:30.833
Grandpa me

15
00:00:31.766 --> 00:00:33.566
Mr. S, I'm here.

16
00:00:37.066 --> 00:00:38.833
You live here

17
00:00:39.333 --> 00:00:40.666
What's the matter?

18
00:00:40.666 --> 00:00:42.966
Yan Yan's biological parents are poor households in Taoyuan County

19
00:00:42.966 --> 00:00:44.566
Why do you live on the other side?

20
00:00:44.566 --> 00:00:46.066
Why Hu Shu

21
00:00:46.966 --> 00:00:48.833
Bye bye

22
00:00:59.666 --> 00:01:02.500
Aoki is preparing a generous gift to leave home tomorrow to annul the marriage

23
00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:03.700
What thorn

24
00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.766
Your engagement to leave home was made by the older generation

25
00:01:05.766 --> 00:01:06.833
You are now breaking off the marriage

26
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.200
It's like hitting a store away from home

27
00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.700
Leave home and make friends with so many people in four families

28
00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:10.966
There will be cracks

29
00:01:10.966 --> 00:01:12.766
It's not just you and the illegitimate daughter who left home

30
00:01:12.766 --> 00:01:13.600
It's more involved

31
00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.466
Away from Home and Four Quality Everyone Read

32
00:01:15.466 --> 00:01:17.100
Fourth President, do you want to reconsider?

33
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.200
Hurry up and get ready

34
00:01:18.266 --> 00:01:19.900
Fourth, you don't think for yourself

35
00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:20.700
Don't consider the family

36
00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.266
Then you can think about it for the old man

37
00:01:22.266 --> 00:01:23.066
He's just not in good health

38
00:01:23.066 --> 00:01:24.166
You break off the marriage like this

39
00:01:24.166 --> 00:01:26.000
Is it if grandpa knew that I was doing it for grandpa?

40
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.666
I just went to cancel the marriage and didn't agree.
