1
00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.300
Will be like this

2
00:00:01.933 --> 00:00:02.766
Hey

3
00:00:03.133 --> 00:00:06.600
I seem to see that Ouyang didn't ask him.

4
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.166
How did this security guard let him in?

5
00:00:08.166 --> 00:00:10.900
I think my sister seemed to have said a few words to the security guard

6
00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:12.366
The security guard let him in

7
00:00:12.533 --> 00:00:14.300
Let's go in and have a look

8
00:00:15.566 --> 00:00:17.200
What's the matter with you two?

9
00:00:17.366 --> 00:00:20.066
The person just now obviously didn't take the invitation letter.

10
00:00:20.133 --> 00:00:21.900
Why did you put him in there?

11
00:00:22.133 --> 00:00:24.033
Who are you? Who do you care?

12
00:00:24.133 --> 00:00:26.466
Hey, I'm sorry.

13
00:00:26.466 --> 00:00:27.566
Where's my wife?

14
00:00:27.566 --> 00:00:28.666
More impatient

15
00:00:28.666 --> 00:00:29.766
You're welcome.

16
00:00:29.766 --> 00:00:33.000
I'll take him to apologize to you.

17
00:00:33.133 --> 00:00:34.066
We mean

18
00:00:34.066 --> 00:00:36.333
What was the identity of that person just now?

19
00:00:36.333 --> 00:00:38.700
Why did you let him in without an invitation?

20
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.533
He's someone you can't afford to offend

21
00:00:40.533 --> 00:00:41.700
I advise you.

22
00:00:41.733 --> 00:00:42.733
Don't provoke

23
00:00:42.733 --> 00:00:43.966
Can't be wrong

24
00:00:43.966 --> 00:00:46.066
A poor girl from the countryside

25
00:00:46.133 --> 00:00:47.500
What's so great about it?

26
00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.066
Then I don't know.

27
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.166
Are you going to get in?

28
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:52.600
Hey, we're in, we're in

29
00:00:57.966 --> 00:00:58.333
heard

30
00:00:58.333 --> 00:01:00.366
The daughter away from home is coming to attend the old lady today

31
00:01:00.366 --> 00:01:01.166
Birthday banquet

32
00:01:02.333 --> 00:01:04.833
The daughter who left home really got it back

33
00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:05.333
Yes!

34
00:01:05.333 --> 00:01:07.800
I heard that the adoptive parents who left home are not good to him

35
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.333
If only they knew they mistook pearls for elm

36
00:01:10.333 --> 00:01:11.666
No Regret to Die

37
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.233
Otherwise, brother

38
00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:15.800
Look at that guy

39
00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.033
Is it the toilet paper money auctioned last time?

40
00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.000
So aren't they managing money?
