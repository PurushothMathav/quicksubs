00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.566
Grandma didn't know until the last minute

2
00:00:02.566 --> 00:00:05.466
Bai Zhenghai is actually not her biological son

3
00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:07.600
So many years

4
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.366
Even if grandpa knew all this

5
00:00:10.966 --> 00:00:14.100
Or treat Bai Zhenghai as his own son

6
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:19.166
I also took a paternity test before coming here

7
00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.366
Come between Zheng Hai and grandma

8
00:00:21.733 --> 00:00:23.600
There is really no blood relationship.

9
00:00:26.566 --> 00:00:27.766
You two

10
00:00:28.166 --> 00:00:29.233
Treat him well

11
00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:32.566
Please.

12
00:00:33.133 --> 00:00:34.400
Cut me some slack.

13
00:00:34.866 --> 00:00:35.900
Please.

14
00:00:36.866 --> 00:00:38.566
Please let me go

15
00:00:38.733 --> 00:00:39.533
Please.

16
00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.800
I really didn't mean for your grandma to have children, did I?

17
00:00:45.366 --> 00:00:49.066
You're not begging me because you think you're wrong

18
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.000
But because you know

19
00:00:51.066 --> 00:00:53.700
Your last straw is gone

20
00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.566
We've been together for 18 years

21
00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:02.966
Who said that I have rarely appeared in your life in the past 18 years?

22
00:01:02.966 --> 00:01:06.966
When I really treat you as my daughter order

23
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.866
It's all the fortune teller's fault, he's talking nonsense

24
00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.066
He said your son is our science

25
00:01:13.866 --> 00:01:16.100
Will make us doomed

26
00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.600
That's why we're disappointed.

27
00:01:19.466 --> 00:01:21.700
Leave you to your grandma

28
00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:25.200
It's my luck.

29
00:01:25.333 --> 00:01:26.833
Hahaha

30
00:01:27.333 --> 00:01:30.200
When I was a child, I wished you could come and see me

31
00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:32.300
Come and accompany me more

32
00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.900
I never understood.

33
00:01:35.266 --> 00:01:37.600
Why? No matter how hard I try

34
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.066
My parents just can't

35
00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.566
It turned out to be just because of a word from the fortune teller

36
00:01:46.966 --> 00:01:49.033
But he did the math right.

37
00:01:49.133 --> 00:01:50.500
What do you mean?

38
00:01:52.333 --> 00:01:54.000
Bai Mu Miao is indeed yours

39
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:54.900
pity

40
00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:56.800
Not me.

41
00:01:57.333 --> 00:01:59.600
He hurt you forever

42
00:02:04.733 --> 00:02:05.833
What are you doing?

43
00:02:05.866 --> 00:02:06.933
Don't come here

44
00:02:06.933 --> 00:02:08.033
Don't come here
