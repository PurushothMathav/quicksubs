00:00:01.166 --> 00:00:01.866
Mom

2
00:00:01.866 --> 00:00:05.266
After all these years, I have the ability to run the company or not.

3
00:00:05.333 --> 00:00:07.100
Did you see this?

4
00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:08.700
Oh, yeah.

5
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.400
This time, it wasn't because Ouyan offended people.

6
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:12.600
You are useless

7
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:13.900
It's Yanyan's fault

8
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.533
Don't you see?

9
00:00:15.533 --> 00:00:17.133
Since you took the New Year quickly

10
00:00:17.133 --> 00:00:19.600
Our family was defeated like a mountain

11
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.966
You God of Wealth sent away

12
00:00:22.966 --> 00:00:24.100
I don't know.

13
00:00:24.766 --> 00:00:27.300
Oh, mom, don't get excited.

14
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.566
Hey, this body is important

15
00:00:30.333 --> 00:00:32.966
I know it's all our fault.

16
00:00:33.066 --> 00:00:33.600
But what?

17
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.233
There's really nothing we can do now.

18
00:00:36.466 --> 00:00:38.566
Otherwise, we will be juniors.

19
00:00:38.566 --> 00:00:39.700
I won't use you.

20
00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:41.900
That little thing in the old man's hand?

21
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.533
That's 10,000 steps back.

22
00:00:44.533 --> 00:00:46.700
If the company goes out of business

23
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.466
How many shares do you have in my hands?

24
00:00:49.466 --> 00:00:51.000
You are really worthless

25
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.200
Solve your own business

26
00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.800
I won't help you.

27
00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.500
Mom, if you really don't want to help us

28
00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.133
Then the company is really doomed

29
00:00:59.133 --> 00:01:00.766
You deserve it.

30
00:01:00.933 --> 00:01:03.000
I don't usually see you come to see me

31
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.033
Now that I need help, I think of my mother

32
00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:07.700
Get out of here

33
00:01:07.733 --> 00:01:09.400
Mom, don't take it out now

34
00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.333
Are you trying to give that dead girl euros?

35
00:01:11.333 --> 00:01:13.700
I can leave my stuff to whoever I want.

36
00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.100
It's not your turn to worry

37
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.100
Get out! Get out

38
00:01:17.166 --> 00:01:18.533
Don't be angry, don't be angry.

39
00:01:18.533 --> 00:01:20.266
Go out and don't come again

40
00:01:20.266 --> 00:01:22.033
I don't want to wait any longer.
