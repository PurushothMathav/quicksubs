00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.766
What 1 million dollars?

2
00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:03.266
That's it.

3
00:00:03.533 --> 00:00:04.900
Here's 1 million dollars

4
00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.066
Here is a villa

5
00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:09.333
And grandpa's high-end supplements that have been treasured for many years

6
00:00:09.333 --> 00:00:11.700
This villa is in the best location in Beijing

7
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:12.833
These supplements

8
00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.400
It's a genuine product that you can't even buy with money in the market.

9
00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:18.966
This is a snack for our lord and madam

10
00:00:20.066 --> 00:00:23.066
Then aren't you a poor household in Taoyuan County?

11
00:00:23.133 --> 00:00:24.166
Where did you get so much money?

12
00:00:24.166 --> 00:00:25.000
Yes!

13
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.466
I heard that my sister's biological parents were unemployed

14
00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.466
Yu said 1 million dollars

15
00:00:30.466 --> 00:00:32.966
It is estimated that 10,000 yuan is difficult

16
00:00:32.966 --> 00:00:35.000
Humph what lord and lady

17
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.866
I think you are Ouyang's poor father

18
00:00:38.666 --> 00:00:42.600
In order to save face, he made his own father pretend to be a driver

19
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:44.166
You are so unfilial

20
00:00:44.566 --> 00:00:47.900
Euro didn't you just feel like your family

21
00:00:48.333 --> 00:00:49.733
Too poor.

22
00:00:49.733 --> 00:00:52.766
Then find a poor father to act with you

23
00:00:52.766 --> 00:00:54.500
Sister, you don't have to do this.

24
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.566
We won't look down on you.

25
00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:58.900
Our lord and madam

26
00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:00.666
Since you are our sixth lady

27
00:01:00.666 --> 00:01:01.800
For the sake of the adoptive parents

28
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.166
Thank you gift

29
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:03.933
I didn't expect it.

30
00:01:03.933 --> 00:01:05.800
How dare you treat our Sixth Miss like this?

31
00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:07.100
Not enough yet

32
00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.100
Just those of you who came out of the ravine

33
00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.200
What good things can you afford?

34
00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.133
I see this bag is tattered

35
00:01:13.133 --> 00:01:15.066
What won't be packed inside is

36
00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:16.900
Garbage bar

37
00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.500
Forget it, Uncle Liu doesn't need to talk nonsense with them.

38
00:01:20.566 --> 00:01:23.200
They don't deserve gifts from their parents

39
00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:24.800
I think it's junk

40
00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.566
I dare not take it out.

41
00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:28.500
You go too far.

42
00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.466
Open your dog eyes and see what this is
