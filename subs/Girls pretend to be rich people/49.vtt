00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.500
I didn't expect my sister to have such a good relationship with my grandmother

2
00:00:03.533 --> 00:00:06.400
My sister left the Bai family and came to the hospital to see you

3
00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:09.433
If you don't know, you think grandma has a shut mouth

4
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:13.033
I didn't mean that.

5
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:14.766
Yaoyao is right

6
00:00:14.766 --> 00:00:17.666
I think this Ou Yan is touching the old lady's inheritance

7
00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.566
Hurry up and transfer the old lady to the hospital.

8
00:00:20.566 --> 00:00:22.833
That Ou Yan checked only half of it.

9
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.766
The old lady is not so eccentric enough

10
00:00:24.766 --> 00:00:26.700
What if you gave him your inheritance?

11
00:00:27.366 --> 00:00:28.600
You're right actually.

12
00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:30.433
I'll do it now.

13
00:00:35.533 --> 00:00:37.766
Han Yicheng, I'll do a career change

14
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.000
The old lady's situation is not suitable for changing careers

15
00:00:40.866 --> 00:00:42.166
If you don't transfer

16
00:00:42.166 --> 00:00:43.800
I'm afraid someone will pester him

17
00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:45.566
Affect his recovery

18
00:00:45.733 --> 00:00:47.200
Are you talking about Oyan?

19
00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.033
I think he cares more about the old lady than you do

20
00:00:49.666 --> 00:00:51.333
If you are really good for the old lady

21
00:00:51.333 --> 00:00:52.600
Let him stay in the gold card

22
00:00:52.866 --> 00:00:54.733
Medical equipment and doctor resources in other hospitals

23
00:00:54.733 --> 00:00:55.766
Far better than entering the card

24
00:00:55.933 --> 00:00:57.133
If you have to transfer

25
00:00:57.133 --> 00:00:58.000
In less than a week

26
00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.966
I'm afraid the old lady will let go and not return it

27
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.433
Right?

28
00:01:02.766 --> 00:01:04.700
Let's stop contagious then.

29
00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.200
What about asking him to take the trouble of his life?

30
00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:17.300
Hey they don't scare me in their life

31
00:01:17.566 --> 00:01:19.666
No matter what scares the old lady

32
00:01:19.666 --> 00:01:20.666
Russia Now

33
00:01:21.733 --> 00:01:25.000
30% of this old lady's hand is worth 300 million

34
00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:26.333
I sent someone to check

35
00:01:26.333 --> 00:01:28.033
He secretly took advantage of it before he was hospitalized

36
00:01:28.866 --> 00:01:29.766
So much for the euro

37
00:01:29.766 --> 00:01:31.600
It will definitely give a lot of wealth to the euro

38
00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:33.266
We need to train him well

39
00:01:33.266 --> 00:01:34.866
Let him transfer the property to us

40
00:01:36.133 --> 00:01:38.500
This old lady is so old-fashioned

41
00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.266
It's better and better for an outsider than for yourself
