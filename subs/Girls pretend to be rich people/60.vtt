00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:03.266
Mrs. Wang, what did you just say about the piano competition?

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:04.766
This Yaoyao

3
00:00:04.766 --> 00:00:06.800
He won the first place in the National Piano Competition

4
00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:09.433
You two don't know

5
00:00:09.466 --> 00:00:11.100
This time, Bo has sent a notice.

6
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:12.900
There's the awards tomorrow at the Grand Theater.

7
00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.600
Mom, I really came in second place.

8
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.166
Great, hahaha.

9
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:20.200
Yaoyao

10
00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.700
Can you win second place in a national competition?

11
00:00:22.933 --> 00:00:24.766
It shows that he is young and promising

12
00:00:25.066 --> 00:00:26.300
I'm here today.

13
00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:27.600
I just want to invite Yaoyao

14
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.633
To endorse our piano brand

15
00:00:29.666 --> 00:00:30.833
What about endorsement fees?

16
00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:45.633
If you choose Ouyang, you will also make a canal.

17
00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:48.266
But it doesn't matter.

18
00:00:48.266 --> 00:00:49.700
It's all mine from now on

19
00:00:52.366 --> 00:00:54.500
I didn't expect Ou Yanxi's score

20
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:55.566
I actually got second place

21
00:00:55.566 --> 00:00:57.466
You can also get the concept of value 5 million

22
00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.500
Yaoyao, what about our contract?

23
00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:00.533
Sign for a year

24
00:01:00.533 --> 00:01:03.266
As for whether the endorsement fee will go up or down after one year

25
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.600
It depends on you.

26
00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.800
Mrs. Wang, you look down on Yaoyao too much

27
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.700
The kid got a little award.

28
00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:12.500
Hey

29
00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.400
The prize value of this competition is very high.

30
00:01:15.466 --> 00:01:16.900
Yaoyao can get second place

31
00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:19.566
It means that his piano is very elegant

32
00:01:20.333 --> 00:01:23.333
Mrs. Wang, this uncle's business is settled

33
00:01:23.333 --> 00:01:24.566
Of course!

34
00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.500
Haha but

35
00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.066
I have two conditions.

36
00:01:28.266 --> 00:01:29.066
first

37
00:01:29.066 --> 00:01:31.400
When Yaoyao endorsed our brand?

38
00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.533
You cannot endorse other piano brands.

39
00:01:33.533 --> 00:01:35.333
Will that be hahaha?

40
00:01:35.333 --> 00:01:36.833
Love is

41
00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.833
There can be no negative news during the contract period

42
00:01:40.133 --> 00:01:41.466
Otherwise

43
00:01:41.766 --> 00:01:43.633
10 times the compensation is required.

44
00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.333
Mrs. Wang, don't worry.

45
00:01:46.333 --> 00:01:47.866
We Yaoyao are very good

46
00:01:48.166 --> 00:01:49.366
This negative impact

47
00:01:49.366 --> 00:01:50.300
negative news

48
00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:52.233
There will be absolutely no negative news
