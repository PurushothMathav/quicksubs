00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:01.133
Lamb is right

2
00:00:01.133 --> 00:00:02.833
I'm going to find someone now

3
00:00:02.866 --> 00:00:05.066
Wang Zhuo's mother quickly sent someone over

4
00:00:05.066 --> 00:00:07.233
Someone stole something from home at the party

5
00:00:09.066 --> 00:00:09.866
So you are

6
00:00:09.866 --> 00:00:12.333
Attending Mrs. Li's birthday banquet with great care

7
00:00:12.333 --> 00:00:13.800
It's ulterior motives

8
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:15.900
Yeah, I'm so disappointed.

9
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.966
You figure it out and you want to arrest people

10
00:00:17.966 --> 00:00:20.366
I caught the wrong person, can you take this responsibility?

11
00:00:20.533 --> 00:00:21.200
Yeah dad

12
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:22.800
In case this is not my brother-in-law

13
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.600
Shall we let him explain?

14
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.133
Yaoyao, you are just too kind-hearted.

15
00:00:27.133 --> 00:00:28.533
It's the right thing to do.

16
00:00:28.533 --> 00:00:30.100
Can we still wrong him?

17
00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:31.500
Mom saw it clearly

18
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.133
This is indeed the heart of the ocean

19
00:00:33.133 --> 00:00:36.433
How could he afford the conditions for the work Euro A?

20
00:00:36.466 --> 00:00:38.300
It was stolen. What else could it be?

21
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:39.200
Yes, Niu Niu

22
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:40.733
When you speak for him

23
00:00:40.733 --> 00:00:41.933
He doesn't get along

24
00:00:41.933 --> 00:00:44.000
When he asked his uncle to throw away the project

25
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.433
No thought at all

26
00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.166
Call and say someone is stealing

27
00:00:48.166 --> 00:00:49.500
He was the one stealing.

28
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.666
Hurry up and take him to the security out

29
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.266
I see which of you dares to do it

30
00:00:53.266 --> 00:00:55.300
Ouyang, you really have the means

31
00:00:55.533 --> 00:00:56.466
Not only does this old man

32
00:00:56.466 --> 00:00:58.633
The man took you to Mrs. Li's birthday party

33
00:00:59.266 --> 00:01:01.266
And let him do this

34
00:01:01.266 --> 00:01:03.566
It's shameless in public

35
00:01:03.566 --> 00:01:07.000
I advise you to leave with your people quickly

36
00:01:07.066 --> 00:01:09.400
Then apologize again to my supervisor

37
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.900
Otherwise, the person who left home will come.

38
00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:12.800
That's not an apology.

39
00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:13.600
Tell you

40
00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:17.100
Shut up and want us to apologize to you

41
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.766
No way, take him back to me quickly

42
00:01:19.766 --> 00:01:21.700
Mrs. Li Gao
