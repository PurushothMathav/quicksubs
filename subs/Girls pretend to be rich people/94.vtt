1
00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.400
Yes, Yanyan.

2
00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:02.733
Ah Chen

3
00:00:02.733 --> 00:00:05.400
This is the biological father we just found

4
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.766
You have eyes. It turns out that Miss Eaves is not surnamed Wu.

5
00:00:08.966 --> 00:00:10.400
The surname is Di, you know each other

6
00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:11.833
Yanyan knows

7
00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.100
It turns out that we Yanyan and Ah Chen are so fated

8
00:00:16.133 --> 00:00:18.166
So Mr. Smith is here today

9
00:00:18.166 --> 00:00:20.700
I want to hear that Miss Li just came home

10
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:22.466
I brought a little gift to have a look.

11
00:00:22.533 --> 00:00:23.866
Aren't you here to annul the marriage?

12
00:00:23.866 --> 00:00:26.433
Is it because the marriage partner is Miss Ouyan?

13
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:28.366
So you changed your mind?

14
00:00:28.366 --> 00:00:29.900
This face change is too fast

15
00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:31.100
Grandpa heard you just got back

16
00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:32.000
Always wanted to see you

17
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.400
I don't know if you have time to watch it with me.

18
00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.666
But I just saw grandpa yesterday.

19
00:00:36.733 --> 00:00:37.800
This time is different

20
00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:39.266
As for the identity of my fiancÃ©e

21
00:00:39.533 --> 00:00:42.566
Grandpa, since the master wants to see you

22
00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:44.266
It is better to choose the day than to hit the day

23
00:00:44.266 --> 00:00:45.700
How are you today?

24
00:00:45.966 --> 00:00:47.466
You have an engagement with Acheng

25
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.500
You go and visit

26
00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:51.500
If you don't want to be your fiancÃ©e

27
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.266
Can you express your concern on behalf of the neighbor?

28
00:00:54.266 --> 00:00:55.800
Well, that's a good idea.

29
00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:56.900
Yeah, I am.

30
00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:59.366
Show my heart on behalf of us leaving home

31
00:00:59.366 --> 00:01:01.400
Then grandpa will pay a visit

32
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.800
Tenth grandpa, you have been back for so many days

33
00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.466
I should go

34
00:01:05.466 --> 00:01:06.700
You go visit

35
00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:07.666
Bring some gifts

36
00:01:07.666 --> 00:01:08.733
Not empty-handed

37
00:01:08.733 --> 00:01:10.100
No need for gifts

38
00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:11.566
Just be humane

39
00:01:11.566 --> 00:01:13.633
No, no, no, first time meeting

40
00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.033
Etiquette is indispensable

41
00:01:15.066 --> 00:01:17.966
Come and prepare. Yes.
