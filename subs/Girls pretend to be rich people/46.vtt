00:00:01.333 --> 00:00:03.700
How is the second brother?

2
00:00:11.566 --> 00:00:13.500
Mrs. Bai Dao is a new company

3
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:15.233
Equivalent to the heart

4
00:00:15.466 --> 00:00:16.300
Come to the end

5
00:00:17.366 --> 00:00:18.433
I regret it, actually

6
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.633
But it's not impossible.

7
00:00:22.466 --> 00:00:24.800
So I'll give you some medicine.

8
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:25.766
What do you press?

9
00:00:26.166 --> 00:00:27.533
When you feel better

10
00:00:27.533 --> 00:00:29.266
I will operate on you myself

11
00:00:30.733 --> 00:00:31.866
Thank you

12
00:00:33.866 --> 00:00:35.400
I want to talk to grandpa

13
00:00:36.133 --> 00:00:37.800
Just chat alone

14
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.900
What's your birthday?

15
00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:58.900
Grandpa

16
00:01:00.066 --> 00:01:01.433
Grandma is ok

17
00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.100
As long as you are fine

18
00:01:05.666 --> 00:01:06.866
These years

19
00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.433
Grandma already regards you as my biological granddaughter

20
00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.800
No matter whose child you are

21
00:01:14.933 --> 00:01:16.366
You Forever

22
00:01:16.933 --> 00:01:18.866
It's my grandson Li Yueluo

23
00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.266
Grandma left one in the house before

24
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.900
There's a gentleman outside

25
00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.900
The bone in grandma's hand is here

26
00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:31.500
It's all chicken soup

27
00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.166
What are you talking about, grandma?

28
00:01:34.166 --> 00:01:36.300
Listen to grandma first

29
00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.866
Prodigal people

30
00:01:40.466 --> 00:01:42.166
I kind of figured it out.

31
00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.266
Until I have not yet established myself

32
00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.033
Mysterious acid engraving

33
00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:54.066
They don't have mental gifts

34
00:01:55.166 --> 00:01:59.366
What if this thing is handed over to them?

35
00:02:00.066 --> 00:02:02.800
Sooner or later, you will fail

36
00:02:02.933 --> 00:02:05.400
Grandma, that's yours.

37
00:02:05.566 --> 00:02:07.066
I can't take it.

38
00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:11.300
Those things are mine

39
00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.700
I can give it to whoever I want

40
00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.166
Don't be burdened.

41
00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.500
Grandma is getting old

42
00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.233
The only one who can't worry

43
00:02:23.466 --> 00:02:24.666
It's you.

44
00:02:26.566 --> 00:02:27.666
Learn love in the future

45
00:02:27.666 --> 00:02:29.600
If they bully you

46
00:02:30.466 --> 00:02:32.833
Or your biological family to you

47
00:02:33.766 --> 00:02:35.833
With grandma, I'll leave you a fortune

48
00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.666
You won't suffer

49
00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.766
Grandma, you will be fine

50
00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:44.300
OK

51
00:02:45.333 --> 00:02:47.000
It will be better tomorrow.

52
00:02:47.066 --> 00:02:48.100
Grandma

53
00:02:48.133 --> 00:02:51.766
You have to look into my eyes and see people with your own eyes
