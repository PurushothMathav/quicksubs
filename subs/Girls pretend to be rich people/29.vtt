00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:02.200
Wow, it's beautiful.

2
00:00:03.933 --> 00:00:07.500
5.50 million 5.50 million a multitude

3
00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:09.966
He must be afraid that others will know that he has no money.

4
00:00:09.966 --> 00:00:10.933
Just pretending

5
00:00:10.933 --> 00:00:12.000
Uncle said it well

6
00:00:12.466 --> 00:00:14.266
What do you like about this picture?

7
00:00:14.266 --> 00:00:15.966
Do you like it, big brother?

8
00:00:15.966 --> 00:00:17.300
My little sister likes my picture

9
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:18.966
Rounded to the nearest, just like me

10
00:00:18.966 --> 00:00:20.733
I am my little sister's favorite brother

11
00:00:20.733 --> 00:00:24.233
Third brother, you are the famous Dot Dawn

12
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.133
Since my little brother likes my painting

13
00:00:27.133 --> 00:00:28.200
Go home and give you flowers

14
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:29.100
It didn't cost much

15
00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:29.966
Thank you third brother

16
00:00:29.966 --> 00:00:30.766
You are welcome

17
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.800
Who made you the third brother's favorite little sister?

18
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.166
6 million 6 million time

19
00:00:35.166 --> 00:00:39.833
6.50 million 6.50 million time 6.60 million 6.60 million time

20
00:00:40.133 --> 00:00:43.066
Your own boys still don't like this bag.

21
00:00:43.066 --> 00:00:45.300
Why did he spend so much money on it?

22
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.533
I heard the assistant say

23
00:00:46.533 --> 00:00:48.333
It looks like they're going to buy the painting.

24
00:00:48.333 --> 00:00:49.700
Apologize to the big brother

25
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.666
I thought it was called big brother

26
00:00:53.666 --> 00:00:55.700
Cold people don't like that kind of wind

27
00:00:55.766 --> 00:00:56.966
Really don't like it

28
00:00:56.966 --> 00:00:58.600
It's your third brother who is so shameless

29
00:00:58.600 --> 00:00:59.900
Put it in my office on purpose

30
00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:00.600
Hey

31
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.133
Brother, don't speak ill of me in front of little sister

32
00:01:03.133 --> 00:01:04.666
I'm just telling the truth

33
00:01:05.133 --> 00:01:07.366
Looking at others, you will think that the eldest brother likes the words of the third brother

34
00:01:07.366 --> 00:01:09.600
Since the little sister thought of it during the day

35
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:10.766
Why don't we help you?
