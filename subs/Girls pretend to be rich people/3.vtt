00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:05.500
The girl doesn't let the nanny

2
00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:07.766
What do you remember about our snacks?

3
00:00:08.266 --> 00:00:12.166
Miss, I heard that your original family is Taoyuan County.

4
00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.400
That's the poorest and most backward animal in the country

5
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:15.366
You still take him

6
00:00:15.366 --> 00:00:17.000
Otherwise, I won't be able to eat you in the future.

7
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:18.833
My dead girl

8
00:00:18.933 --> 00:00:20.100
It depends on your attitude.

9
00:00:20.166 --> 00:00:22.466
How do you feel when you go there with you, even me?

10
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.800
Mom, don't be angry.

11
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.066
Sister is not angry now

12
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.100
Both biological parents are daughters

13
00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.833
There are still 5 brothers in the family who have not married daughters-in-law

14
00:00:31.966 --> 00:00:33.366
A seriously ill woman

15
00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.366
You are destined to be trampled under my feet in your life

16
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.966
Never come back

17
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:41.600
Little flower

18
00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.300
I'm sorry, what kind of broken car is this?

19
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.733
It's embarrassing to drive here

20
00:00:55.733 --> 00:00:57.666
I don't know how poor this family is

21
00:00:57.666 --> 00:00:58.800
What a stupid car

22
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.100
Probably rented

23
00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:01.933
I was rear-ended by a big truck on the road just now

24
00:01:01.933 --> 00:01:03.800
I borrowed a van temporarily from the repair shop

25
00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.266
I checked it doesn't affect driving

26
00:01:05.266 --> 00:01:06.933
Please wait for me.

27
00:01:06.933 --> 00:01:08.066
Grandpa and Madam

28
00:01:08.066 --> 00:01:09.866
We have prepared a gift for your adoptive parents

29
00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:16.266
This is a little thought from our side.

30
00:01:16.266 --> 00:01:18.133
It's just that the gift box was damaged on the way.

31
00:01:18.133 --> 00:01:19.366
I'll find a bag to pack temporarily.

32
00:01:19.366 --> 00:01:20.166
Hope

33
00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.300
What good stuff can you hold in this broken bag?

34
00:01:23.366 --> 00:01:24.700
Our Bai family is not rare
