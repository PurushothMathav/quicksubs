00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:05.800
What are you doing here?

2
00:00:07.133 --> 00:00:12.066
Mom, I know you've always been angry, right?

3
00:00:12.066 --> 00:00:14.066
It's us who shouldn't

4
00:00:14.266 --> 00:00:16.800
You shouldn't put Yanyan on the ambition network

5
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.366
It separated you two

6
00:00:18.366 --> 00:00:21.966
Mom, Zheng Hai and I regret it now too

7
00:00:21.966 --> 00:00:23.666
The children we owe

8
00:00:24.133 --> 00:00:25.466
Too much. Too much.

9
00:00:25.866 --> 00:00:28.766
Mom, you have to help us.

10
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.700
As long as you are a middleman

11
00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:33.800
Let Yanyan and we settle our differences

12
00:00:34.466 --> 00:00:37.266
Okay? As soon as you open your mouth

13
00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.566
This Yanyan will definitely forgive us

14
00:00:39.566 --> 00:00:41.866
I can't let go of this old face

15
00:00:42.466 --> 00:00:43.300
Omg

16
00:00:43.366 --> 00:00:46.700
Now I don't know who else to ask but you

17
00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:48.500
Then help us.

18
00:00:48.666 --> 00:00:50.066
How about recently?

19
00:00:50.066 --> 00:00:51.900
A lot has happened at the company

20
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:55.366
The pain of the real estate in my name has come a lot

21
00:00:55.366 --> 00:00:58.233
But it's still unstoppable.

22
00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.566
If you want to go on like this

23
00:01:00.566 --> 00:01:03.033
The company did go out of business

24
00:01:04.166 --> 00:01:07.800
I'll tell you how you went back to repent

25
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.900
Are you afraid that the company will go bankrupt?

26
00:01:10.533 --> 00:01:14.200
Lost the life of fine clothes and jade food?

27
00:01:14.766 --> 00:01:16.900
Mom, you don't know

28
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.633
It's not just about the company

29
00:01:18.866 --> 00:01:21.633
A few days ago, Yaoyao said a few unintentional words

30
00:01:21.933 --> 00:01:24.133
Yanyan, she really cares

31
00:01:24.133 --> 00:01:25.500
She wants to sue Yaoyao

32
00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:27.633
Not only ask for compensation

33
00:01:27.766 --> 00:01:29.633
And a public apology.

34
00:01:29.966 --> 00:01:31.233
Now Yaoyao is facing

35
00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.166
Resident rebels

36
00:01:33.166 --> 00:01:35.200
That must be what Yaoyao said

37
00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:39.700
I see Yanyan

38
00:01:41.333 --> 00:01:44.333
Mom, why didn't you even ask?

39
00:01:44.333 --> 00:01:46.066
Just say Yanyan did the right thing.

40
00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.666
Yaoyao or is it your dear granddaughter?

41
00:01:48.666 --> 00:01:50.266
How can you let an outsider

42
00:01:50.266 --> 00:01:52.566
Bullied on the head of your own granddaughter?
