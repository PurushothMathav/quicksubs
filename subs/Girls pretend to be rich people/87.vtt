00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:02.800
Sorry.

2
00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.100
Hello grandpa

3
00:00:07.166 --> 00:00:09.466
Dad, I only need 2 minutes of your time.

4
00:00:09.466 --> 00:00:10.533
Don't hang up

5
00:00:10.533 --> 00:00:12.166
Yaoyao provoked your work

6
00:00:12.166 --> 00:00:13.466
It's really his fault.

7
00:00:13.466 --> 00:00:13.900
What about just now?

8
00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:16.700
His parents have already severely criticized him at home

9
00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:17.466
What about this?

10
00:00:17.466 --> 00:00:18.533
Dad is also responsible

11
00:00:18.533 --> 00:00:19.400
Didn't teach him well

12
00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.566
Caused him to make such a serious mistake

13
00:00:21.566 --> 00:00:22.566
Are you free now?

14
00:00:22.566 --> 00:00:25.200
Mom and Dad took him to apologize to you in person

15
00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.566
No need, don't dad Yaya

16
00:00:27.566 --> 00:00:28.666
Dad, please!

17
00:00:28.666 --> 00:00:30.000
You give Yaoyao a chance

18
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.466
Also give parents a chance

19
00:00:31.466 --> 00:00:34.000
There were many things that my parents did wrong in the past

20
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.200
Don't break your heart.

21
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.733
But can you look at grandma's face?

22
00:00:37.733 --> 00:00:39.400
You have no right to mention grandma

23
00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:40.566
Hey, yes, yes, yes.

24
00:00:40.566 --> 00:00:42.000
I'm not qualified to mention your grandmother

25
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:42.666
But

26
00:00:42.666 --> 00:00:45.300
If grandma knew that the Bai family would be here, dad

27
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.000
In my hand

28
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.333
He will be heartbroken

29
00:00:47.333 --> 00:00:49.866
By then he was getting sicker

30
00:00:49.866 --> 00:00:52.200
It's all my parents' fault

31
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.500
You're right to be sad

32
00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.300
We don't ask for your forgiveness

33
00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.800
I would if you want

34
00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.366
Yuanyuan, how can you calm down?

35
00:01:00.366 --> 00:01:02.833
As long as dad can make it in 2 minutes

36
00:01:04.666 --> 00:01:05.633
Nope.

37
00:01:06.266 --> 00:01:07.300
You who fail

38
00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.033
Feel free to go online if you need help

39
00:01:11.366 --> 00:01:12.700
Don't worry, Mr. Si

40
00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:13.800
I can handle it myself

41
00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.400
Then I shall go home first.

42
00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:16.200
I send

43
00:01:16.966 --> 00:01:20.966
You don't have to happen to be on the way out, okay?

44
00:01:24.466 --> 00:01:25.833
You still can't let him go
