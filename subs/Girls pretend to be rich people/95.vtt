00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:05.400
Fourth grandpa is fine, hahaha

2
00:00:06.333 --> 00:00:08.866
How can a silly child be called Fourth Grandpa?

3
00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:10.633
We will be a family from now on

4
00:00:10.933 --> 00:00:12.433
Just call grandpa

5
00:00:12.666 --> 00:00:15.500
Hahaha, I heard it clearly.

6
00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:18.366
You are the relative and friend who left home and kept me away

7
00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.300
Now Ah Cheng's fiancee again

8
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:22.633
What a coincidence

9
00:00:22.666 --> 00:00:24.033
It's been so many years

10
00:00:24.333 --> 00:00:25.500
Always out there

11
00:00:25.566 --> 00:00:28.666
I suffered grandpa I didn't suffer

12
00:00:28.666 --> 00:00:30.533
Oh, what a good boy.

13
00:00:30.533 --> 00:00:33.633
Don't worry, the ideal will be private with us in the future.

14
00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.800
It will definitely be twice as good for you.

15
00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:39.700
This one.

16
00:00:40.466 --> 00:00:43.533
This is when Grandma Ah Chen and I got married

17
00:00:43.533 --> 00:00:45.400
Among his many dowries

18
00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.033
His favorite massage

19
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.100
He said to me

20
00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.866
Afterwards, Ah Chen brought his beloved girl back

21
00:00:50.866 --> 00:00:53.966
Let me give him to you in private.

22
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.633
Grandpa, this is too expensive for me. I can't take it.

23
00:00:57.666 --> 00:00:59.233
This is Chen's grandmother

24
00:00:59.266 --> 00:01:01.066
A gift for my granddaughter-in-law

25
00:01:01.066 --> 00:01:02.500
This is one of his blessings

26
00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:03.866
How could you not?

27
00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:05.800
So Chen

28
00:01:06.166 --> 00:01:08.766
You keep it for grandpa first

29
00:01:08.933 --> 00:01:10.266
Look how beautiful

30
00:01:10.266 --> 00:01:12.566
It's like it was customized for grandpa.

31
00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.500
Haha, we don't want it.

32
00:01:16.466 --> 00:01:17.866
Hey so be it

33
00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.500
So you and Ah Chen stay here

34
00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.200
Grandpa asked the chef to cook for you two

35
00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.600
I didn't expect my fiancee to be really you.

36
00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.266
You won't run away this time, will you?

37
00:01:35.666 --> 00:01:38.266
Mr. Sun, as I said

38
00:01:38.266 --> 00:01:40.600
I didn't start what I had in front of me

39
00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.600
It's okay, I can wait.
