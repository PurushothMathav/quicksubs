00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:02.666
You are going to piss me off

2
00:00:03.166 --> 00:00:04.266
My heart

3
00:00:04.533 --> 00:00:05.500
My heart

4
00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:07.900
My chest hurts. Ouch.

5
00:00:07.933 --> 00:00:10.233
Okay, grandpa, stop pretending

6
00:00:10.566 --> 00:00:12.433
Your vision is too grandiose

7
00:00:13.266 --> 00:00:15.700
Okay okay don't talk about this

8
00:00:18.066 --> 00:00:20.766
Ah Chen, I remember

9
00:00:20.933 --> 00:00:23.600
The person who saved me today is a little girl

10
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.033
You try it

11
00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.600
I found him, and he came to get me.

12
00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:32.766
I want to thank my grandfather in person, don't worry.

13
00:00:32.766 --> 00:00:34.400
I've asked Aoki to check it out.

14
00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:35.900
If he wants to

15
00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:37.633
I'll ask Aoki to bring him to pick you up

16
00:00:37.966 --> 00:00:39.466
That's more like it.

17
00:00:41.366 --> 00:00:42.500
Just go.

18
00:00:43.366 --> 00:00:44.766
Why are you still sitting here?

19
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.066
I'll let you go

20
00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.266
OK, then you have a good rest.

21
00:00:51.266 --> 00:00:52.666
Hurry up and shoot

22
00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.166
Mr. No. 4, then I'll go first, you have a good rest

23
00:01:10.466 --> 00:01:12.033
Okay, got it.

24
00:01:14.266 --> 00:01:17.666
Mr. Si can't find 15 younger brothers at this moment

25
00:01:30.666 --> 00:01:33.266
Hello, who is I?

26
00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.566
Mr. Siye Chen Si

27
00:01:35.733 --> 00:01:37.166
What's the matter?

28
00:01:37.266 --> 00:01:38.233
Is that so?

29
00:01:38.933 --> 00:01:41.200
Thank you so much for saving my grandpa today.

30
00:01:41.366 --> 00:01:43.300
I wanted to thank you in person.

31
00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:45.600
No need, who said they knew?

32
00:01:45.733 --> 00:01:47.633
Don't worry about Mr. Si

33
00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:51.100
Is that so?

34
00:01:51.666 --> 00:01:54.300
My grandpa knows you saved him and must see him

35
00:01:54.666 --> 00:01:57.200
Or go on a hunger strike

36
00:01:57.966 --> 00:02:00.500
Let's see if you are free to meet him with me.

37
00:02:01.333 --> 00:02:03.100
Well, all right.

38
00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:04.600
Then send me the address.

39
00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:05.700
I'll pick you up tomorrow.

40
00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.966
I don't need it, I can go by myself
