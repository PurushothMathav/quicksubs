00:00:03.266 --> 00:00:04.100
little sister

2
00:00:05.733 --> 00:00:07.666
Are you alright, little sister is alright?

3
00:00:12.666 --> 00:00:14.066
What are you?

4
00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:15.966
Dare to run away and bump into your nosy business

5
00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:18.400
Luo Nu, you are really a lucky excuse

6
00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.300
This man is returning one by one

7
00:00:22.133 --> 00:00:24.000
Ivory coming out of the dog's mouth.

8
00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:25.066
Say another word.

9
00:00:25.066 --> 00:00:26.366
But I tore your mouth

10
00:00:26.366 --> 00:00:27.900
How dare you hit me?

11
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.800
Sister, are you jealous?

12
00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.900
We are going to cooperate with Away from Home soon.

13
00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:32.733
So let people fight

14
00:00:32.733 --> 00:00:34.400
Wuye Ouyang

15
00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:35.800
Take them away

16
00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.200
If Mr. Li knew you were making trouble at the signing ceremony

17
00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:39.366
I won't let you go.

18
00:00:39.366 --> 00:00:42.133
This is how your Bai family used to treat him

19
00:00:42.133 --> 00:00:43.766
How did your Bai family treat him?

20
00:00:43.766 --> 00:00:45.100
What does it have to do with you?

21
00:00:45.166 --> 00:00:46.200
In that case

22
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.566
Projects of our Lin Group

23
00:00:47.566 --> 00:00:49.166
Don't take it either.

24
00:00:49.166 --> 00:00:50.766
This is the group

25
00:00:50.766 --> 00:00:52.866
Could it be that it is also Mr. Li?

26
00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:54.400
Mr. Li

27
00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:56.500
Mr. Li

28
00:00:58.166 --> 00:01:00.300
Oh, Mr. Li of Jiuyang Jiuyang

29
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.200
I didn't expect you to come in person

30
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.700
How would I know if I didn't come?

31
00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:06.266
How dare you bully him like this

32
00:01:06.266 --> 00:01:07.066
Mr. Li

33
00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:08.766
You and Ou Yan

34
00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.266
What is the relationship?
