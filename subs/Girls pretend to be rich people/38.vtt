00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:02.566
Oh yeah you are so lawless

2
00:00:02.566 --> 00:00:05.400
You actually gave Mr. Li to Miss Li

3
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:06.666
Cowardly let someone steal it

4
00:00:06.666 --> 00:00:09.066
You dare to touch the things that you leave home

5
00:00:09.066 --> 00:00:11.900
Say you are stupid, you are really brainless

6
00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:14.866
Is it possible that this is what my eldest brother gave me?

7
00:00:14.866 --> 00:00:16.700
Your big brother

8
00:00:17.066 --> 00:00:19.766
It's the old man who can't get a wife

9
00:00:19.766 --> 00:00:20.800
Is it Ouyang?

10
00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:22.700
Do you know how much this heart of the ocean costs?

11
00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:25.166
Your big brother is doing his life's work

12
00:00:25.166 --> 00:00:27.066
Can't even afford a broken diamond on it

13
00:00:27.066 --> 00:00:30.300
Most of what my sister brought are counterfeits.

14
00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.133
I'd rather see this heart of the ocean

15
00:00:32.133 --> 00:00:33.000
Is it true?

16
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:33.866
Hey what are you doing

17
00:00:34.066 --> 00:00:36.466
Let me go up, let me go, do you hear me?

18
00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.866
This is the real Heart of the Coast.

19
00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:44.166
Ok Ouyan

20
00:00:44.366 --> 00:00:46.300
You don't admit to stealing anything.

21
00:00:46.466 --> 00:00:48.333
Do you still think you can blur?

22
00:00:48.333 --> 00:00:48.933
Yes!

23
00:00:48.933 --> 00:00:50.933
Think we're all out of our minds?

24
00:00:50.933 --> 00:00:53.466
Speechless, wouldn't you do it this way?

25
00:00:53.466 --> 00:00:54.866
Want to provoke ideals

26
00:00:54.866 --> 00:00:57.033
Let us have no more opportunities and ideals

27
00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:58.100
I didn't expect it.

28
00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.933
You are so vicious at your young age

29
00:01:00.933 --> 00:01:03.600
Okay, so that's your idea

30
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.766
Haven't you hurt our Bai family enough?

31
00:01:05.766 --> 00:01:07.300
Sister, your parents have raised you for so many years

32
00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:08.733
How can you avenge your kindness?

33
00:01:08.733 --> 00:01:10.400
He didn't even let go of his adoptive parents

34
00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.100
That's so heartless, dad

35
00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.266
What if your family takes it out on us?

36
00:01:14.733 --> 00:01:16.766
Good, why don't we take him in now?

37
00:01:16.766 --> 00:01:18.100
Leave it to Mrs. Li to leave home

38
00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:19.533
Look, we caught the thief

39
00:01:19.533 --> 00:01:21.100
By the way, for the sake of water and electricity

40
00:01:21.133 --> 00:01:22.700
Maybe not planned

41
00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.400
If the family comes, it will be too late.
