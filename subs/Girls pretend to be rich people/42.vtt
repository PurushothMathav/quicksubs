00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.200
I don't cry

2
00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:05.033
Grandma, I also prepared a birthday present for you.

3
00:00:08.533 --> 00:00:11.266
Ouch, grandma also prepared a gift for you.

4
00:00:11.266 --> 00:00:13.566
Haha come

5
00:00:15.166 --> 00:00:17.500
This is a gift from grandma to you.

6
00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:18.400
It's too expensive

7
00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:19.566
Grandma holds

8
00:00:19.566 --> 00:00:20.966
If you refuse to accept it

9
00:00:20.966 --> 00:00:22.666
Grandma won't accept your gift

10
00:00:22.666 --> 00:00:23.966
Thank you, Grandma.

11
00:00:23.966 --> 00:00:25.766
Grandma will replace it for you by hand.

12
00:00:32.366 --> 00:00:35.400
It's so beautiful. Our Yanyan is so beautiful.

13
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:36.566
Thanks.

14
00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.266
Grandma, this is the bracelet I picked especially for you.

15
00:00:40.733 --> 00:00:41.733
Do you like it?

16
00:00:41.733 --> 00:00:42.700
like

17
00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:45.400
Grandma likes it as long as it's a gift from you

18
00:00:45.933 --> 00:00:49.266
But this is all bought with the pocket money given by my father

19
00:00:49.266 --> 00:00:51.800
So I have prepared another gift for you.

20
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.633
And gifts. Hmm.

21
00:00:53.666 --> 00:00:56.033
Please wait for me.
