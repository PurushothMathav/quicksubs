00:00:01.266 --> 00:00:03.100
Didn't I tell you not to come?

2
00:00:03.666 --> 00:00:05.066
Zheng Hai and I both know

3
00:00:05.066 --> 00:00:06.100
You made a will

4
00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:07.766
Give the inheritance to Oudian

5
00:00:07.933 --> 00:00:09.933
The unrelated guy

6
00:00:09.933 --> 00:00:12.000
What do you give him that suits me?

7
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.966
I will give it to whoever I love

8
00:00:13.966 --> 00:00:15.600
It's up to you.

9
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.533
Last time, you said you owed Grandpa too much

10
00:00:18.533 --> 00:00:19.933
I want to clear up the past

11
00:00:19.933 --> 00:00:21.933
Why is there no blood relationship now?

12
00:00:21.933 --> 00:00:22.966
Relationship with outsiders

13
00:00:22.966 --> 00:00:26.500
Mom used to be our really indifferent grandfather

14
00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:27.600
Want to make up for him

15
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.266
But that horse is a horse

16
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.900
Should your stuff be given to the closest person?

17
00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:34.900
Mom, Yaoyao is your biological granddaughter.

18
00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:36.600
How much did he suffer outside?

19
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:37.700
How much have you suffered?

20
00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:39.200
Finally got home

21
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:40.300
You grandma

22
00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:41.900
Don't you feel sorry?

23
00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.900
Don't you want to compensate?

24
00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:45.666
How could I not feel sorry for him?

25
00:00:45.666 --> 00:00:48.866
As long as he gets home and gets along well with his grandfather

26
00:00:48.866 --> 00:00:50.666
The inheritance naturally has his share

27
00:00:50.666 --> 00:00:51.700
But what about him?

28
00:00:51.733 --> 00:00:53.100
Aim for cover everywhere

29
00:00:53.266 --> 00:00:56.233
In the end, there is only a face in your heart

30
00:00:56.266 --> 00:00:58.866
Mom, a lot has happened at the company lately

31
00:00:58.866 --> 00:01:00.933
I sold out all my properties

32
00:01:00.933 --> 00:01:03.766
I finally bought the most valuable piece of land

33
00:01:03.766 --> 00:01:06.900
But I heard that construction must start within a month

34
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.466
He also said that it cannot be transferred for sale within 5 years

35
00:01:09.466 --> 00:01:12.266
I borrowed money from the bank and many friends

36
00:01:12.266 --> 00:01:14.933
But that's millions in interest every month

37
00:01:14.933 --> 00:01:16.700
Recently, the company has not been able to turn around well.

38
00:01:16.733 --> 00:01:18.333
I can't repay the loan to him

39
00:01:18.333 --> 00:01:19.566
If you don't help us

40
00:01:19.566 --> 00:01:21.400
Our family really paid it back

41
00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:25.100
If you hadn't ignored me all these years

42
00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.100
You didn't come to see me when I was sick and in the hospital

43
00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:29.866
Even wish I died

44
00:01:29.966 --> 00:01:31.333
If it weren't for you

45
00:01:31.333 --> 00:01:33.700
Drive my granddaughter away without telling me

46
00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:37.100
If you hadn't done so much over the years

47
00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:38.766
Of course I will help you.

48
00:01:38.766 --> 00:01:41.733
But now it's too late.

49
00:01:41.733 --> 00:01:43.366
Your own sins

50
00:01:43.366 --> 00:01:44.866
Do it yourself
