00:00:01.133 --> 00:00:01.933
Oye

2
00:00:01.966 --> 00:00:04.966
Why do you go wherever our Bai family goes?

3
00:00:04.966 --> 00:00:07.133
We've made it very clear

4
00:00:07.133 --> 00:00:09.100
Even if you keep wanting to pester

5
00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:10.900
Our Bai family will not take you in either.

6
00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:14.066
You don't think I want to go back to your Bai family, do you?

7
00:00:14.066 --> 00:00:15.566
Then what are you doing here?

8
00:00:15.566 --> 00:00:17.600
Dressed up

9
00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.766
Don't think you rent one of these dresses

10
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.700
You can be a superhero

11
00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:23.966
What about the situation on the master's side?

12
00:00:23.966 --> 00:00:25.933
Why don't we spend money here?

13
00:00:25.933 --> 00:00:27.366
Be big

14
00:00:27.366 --> 00:00:29.400
What if the money runs out after that?

15
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.300
Even if you have no money, you still come here for me to see.

16
00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:34.500
Eighty percent know about the cooperation.

17
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:35.566
Just pay some money

18
00:00:35.566 --> 00:00:36.333
Yes!

19
00:00:36.333 --> 00:00:39.266
After all, Lin's Group gave Bai's Group 1 billion money

20
00:00:39.266 --> 00:00:40.900
He's going to this ravine

21
00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:41.966
Never see

22
00:00:41.966 --> 00:00:45.100
Do you want less money for the money given to you before the story?

23
00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:48.166
You're not here to get my attention this time

24
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.300
Big brother took the project for nothing

25
00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.866
Yes, Miss Liu

26
00:00:53.166 --> 00:00:56.300
Why didn't I find Ouyin so beautiful before?

27
00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:57.766
In such good shape

28
00:00:57.766 --> 00:00:58.766
Brother Gao

29
00:00:58.766 --> 00:01:00.500
You said the one next to my sister

30
00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:02.300
Who else?

31
00:01:02.333 --> 00:01:04.533
It must be the wild man that Ouyang hooked up with

32
00:01:04.533 --> 00:01:07.866
Otherwise, how could he come in?

33
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.766
Blind murderer

34
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.000
You don't cooperate with the terrain group at all

35
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.400
What are you?

36
00:01:13.533 --> 00:01:15.700
Dare to talk to us here

37
00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:18.066
Houno, you are so shameless!

38
00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.266
Not long after I left, I couldn't wait to find a man

39
00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.600
And found a man so old

40
00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.000
I see you.

41
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.033
You can't live without a man.

42
00:01:27.066 --> 00:01:29.000
Sister, he is a few years older than you.

43
00:01:29.266 --> 00:01:31.000
Don't be fooled by him.

44
00:01:31.066 --> 00:01:32.366
Don't fake it

45
00:01:32.366 --> 00:01:35.200
You think everyone is as blind as they are?

46
00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.233
I can't see what kind of goods you are

47
00:01:37.266 --> 00:01:40.266
Why don't you say a few words when you're dead?

48
00:01:40.366 --> 00:01:42.966
Euro This is not the place for you

49
00:01:42.966 --> 00:01:44.000
You better go

50
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.433
Don't affect my cooperation with Li Jia

51
00:01:46.466 --> 00:01:48.900
Otherwise, I'll be rude to you.

52
00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:50.300
You're welcome to me.

53
00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.600
Then I'm afraid I won't cooperate with you when I leave home.
