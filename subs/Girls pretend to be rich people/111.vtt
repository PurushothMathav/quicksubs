00:00:02.566 --> 00:00:03.266
Hello miss

2
00:00:03.266 --> 00:00:05.166
No, the new boss of the group is here.

3
00:00:05.166 --> 00:00:06.300
Pardon me?

4
00:00:06.466 --> 00:00:07.600
My parents are not dead yet

5
00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.800
Who is so arrogant and dares to impersonate my parents?

6
00:00:13.566 --> 00:00:15.600
You are the new boss they say

7
00:00:21.466 --> 00:00:22.266
Oye

8
00:00:22.966 --> 00:00:25.100
You eat too ugly

9
00:00:25.533 --> 00:00:27.666
Grandma just passed away

10
00:00:27.666 --> 00:00:28.933
The corpse is still warm

11
00:00:28.933 --> 00:00:31.000
You can't wait to be the new boss

12
00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:33.566
Even without the job

13
00:00:34.466 --> 00:00:37.400
I am also the most attractive person in this company

14
00:00:38.866 --> 00:00:40.500
Miss Bai, I choose the center

15
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.466
It turns out that the shares were buried by you

16
00:00:47.933 --> 00:00:49.266
Oh, I see.

17
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.666
You deliberately released that message.

18
00:00:51.966 --> 00:00:54.900
Said that after buying this land, it can be doubled several times

19
00:00:55.466 --> 00:00:57.633
You go around to my parents and they will sell their shares

20
00:00:58.066 --> 00:00:59.600
Not too stupid

21
00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.366
Is to stay and work for me

22
00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:07.900
Or leave with him?

23
00:01:12.066 --> 00:01:13.400
I am willing to work for Mr. Ou

24
00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.066
Ok throw him out

25
00:01:16.333 --> 00:01:17.966
About him

26
00:01:17.966 --> 00:01:19.466
You and throw it out

27
00:01:19.566 --> 00:01:20.500
Ok Mr. Ou

28
00:01:21.533 --> 00:01:22.400
Miss Bai

29
00:01:22.933 --> 00:01:24.033
Please leave.

30
00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.800
I tell you not to go too far

31
00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:28.800
My dad used to do you a lot of good

32
00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:30.966
But he also beat and scolded me a lot

33
00:01:31.166 --> 00:01:33.100
He's been having a rough time.

34
00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:34.666
Everything is on my head

35
00:01:34.666 --> 00:01:36.466
If I hadn't had a wife and children to support

36
00:01:36.466 --> 00:01:38.200
Car loan, mortgage to be paid

37
00:01:38.733 --> 00:01:40.033
I don't do it anymore.

38
00:01:40.266 --> 00:01:41.066
you

39
00:01:41.733 --> 00:01:42.600
Go, go.

40
00:01:45.066 --> 00:01:45.866
Go for a drink
