00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:01.933
This is the young girl of the Bai family

2
00:00:01.933 --> 00:00:02.733
Yes!

3
00:00:03.533 --> 00:00:04.833
Teach him a lesson.

4
00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:06.600
Yes, yes.

5
00:00:07.266 --> 00:00:08.500
Although Blue Hand has a grudge

6
00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.500
Then the girls look clean

7
00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:13.400
I didn't expect my private life to be so chaotic

8
00:00:13.666 --> 00:00:17.400
Bai Yuyao, you really don't cry when you see the coffin

9
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:18.800
OK

10
00:00:20.466 --> 00:00:21.800
And I want you to look at the screen.

11
00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.533
This song was played in March this year

12
00:00:28.533 --> 00:00:30.233
Due to its several upward proportions

13
00:00:30.466 --> 00:00:32.366
Has been included in music textbooks

14
00:00:32.566 --> 00:00:34.466
The new textbook has been printed

15
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.100
It's coming out in September.

16
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.600
Before that

17
00:00:40.133 --> 00:00:41.966
This is indeed the music education of the year

18
00:00:42.966 --> 00:00:43.766
Bai Muyao

19
00:00:44.866 --> 00:00:47.466
How dare you defy the National Piano Competition

20
00:00:47.466 --> 00:00:48.500
blatant plagiarism

21
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.600
I announce the cancellation of all your prizes

22
00:00:52.666 --> 00:00:53.466
In addition

23
00:00:54.066 --> 00:00:56.000
As a representative of the Piano Association

24
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.466
Reject the anxiety of your life

25
00:00:57.766 --> 00:00:59.800
Without the permission of the author

26
00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:01.566
Personal interest in the eyes

27
00:01:01.766 --> 00:01:03.200
Flirting with other people's works

28
00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.800
You said it was already clear

29
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:06.800
Will be reacted

30
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.066
The doctor will see you soon.

31
00:01:11.766 --> 00:01:14.433
I'm sorry. I apologize. I was wrong.

32
00:01:21.366 --> 00:01:22.166
Yaoyao

33
00:01:22.866 --> 00:01:24.266
Yaoyao Yaoyao

34
00:01:26.133 --> 00:01:27.766
Xiao Yang, do you want to piss me off?

35
00:01:27.766 --> 00:01:29.700
Mom, why are you here?

36
00:01:29.866 --> 00:01:31.300
How many times have you said that?

37
00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:32.800
Let you break up with that dead girl

38
00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:33.766
You just wouldn't listen?

39
00:01:33.766 --> 00:01:35.366
You even came here?

40
00:01:35.366 --> 00:01:38.533
You say that white curtain shake is not worthy of your love at all

41
00:01:38.533 --> 00:01:39.800
If you marry her

42
00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:41.866
You will be laughed at for a lifetime

43
00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:44.900
Lizhen, you are right not to recognize this daughter-in-law

44
00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:47.066
He actually plagiarized at the national competition

45
00:01:47.266 --> 00:01:49.433
It's a disgrace to be thrown into the Pacific Ocean

46
00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:51.400
It's Baijia

47
00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:54.300
The girl who was taken away before was pretty good

48
00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:55.400
Very talented

49
00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.266
And he's still a long-lost young man down there

50
00:01:59.566 --> 00:02:01.666
If this lamb marries him

51
00:02:01.666 --> 00:02:04.033
Crops will take off later
