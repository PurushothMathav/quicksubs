00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:02.866
Grandpa, there's 5 million

2
00:00:02.866 --> 00:00:06.366
It's the pocket money that Mom and Dad prepared for you.

3
00:00:06.533 --> 00:00:10.300
No, Dad, you're eating too much, not much, not much

4
00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:11.500
I will give it to my mother.

5
00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:12.933
I'm also worried that I'll give it less.

6
00:00:12.933 --> 00:00:14.933
Little sister and big brother have also prepared it for you.

7
00:00:14.933 --> 00:00:15.766
And second brother

8
00:00:16.733 --> 00:00:17.600
Four more.

9
00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:20.666
There are 5 more.

10
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:22.333
How many houses do you have?

11
00:00:22.333 --> 00:00:24.366
Prepare pocket money for my little sister and don't tell me

12
00:00:24.366 --> 00:00:25.900
Who calls your conscience?

13
00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.500
I don't even know how to prepare my little sister's pocket money.

14
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.033
Little sister, add a WeChat.

15
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:34.566
Yes, yes, you can add Mom and Dad.

16
00:00:34.566 --> 00:00:36.166
Hey, hey, hey.

17
00:00:36.166 --> 00:00:37.400
I said it first.

18
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:38.866
One by one, you have to queue up.

19
00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.500
Little sister, don't spend money to transfer money.

20
00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.366
Take it, thank you, Mom and Dad.

21
00:00:45.933 --> 00:00:47.266
Thank you brother

22
00:00:47.333 --> 00:00:49.700
You're welcome to the fool's own family

23
00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.666
Haha, little sister, I'm glad you can be anything.

24
00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.766
Little sister welcome home

25
00:00:55.966 --> 00:00:57.766
Ouch, what is this?

26
00:00:57.766 --> 00:00:59.566
Why are you still crying?

27
00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:01.600
Oops don't cry

28
00:01:02.566 --> 00:01:03.600
I want to help too

29
00:01:03.933 --> 00:01:06.466
I want to help too, hahaha.
