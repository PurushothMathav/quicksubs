00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:01.866
Don't think you're making a phone call

2
00:00:01.866 --> 00:00:04.266
It can stop us from signing a contract with the Li Group

3
00:00:04.266 --> 00:00:06.400
Hey, I don't know who to call yet

4
00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.966
Maybe it's for 10086.

5
00:00:08.966 --> 00:00:10.633
Hahaha

6
00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:11.933
young man

7
00:00:11.933 --> 00:00:14.000
You say what's wrong with you at a young age?

8
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.400
Gotta do this stupid pocket

9
00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:18.500
Hurry up and leave the Li Group, I can afford it

10
00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:19.533
You are stupid

11
00:00:19.533 --> 00:00:20.333
Humph

12
00:00:20.666 --> 00:00:22.700
I kindly advise you to be so ignorant, right?

13
00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:23.133
Ouyang Yang

14
00:00:23.133 --> 00:00:25.400
What about our years of love for women?

15
00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.066
Apologize to me in your next life now.

16
00:00:27.066 --> 00:00:27.933
Can I?

17
00:00:27.933 --> 00:00:30.400
Don't care about the mistake you just made

18
00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.700
If you have time, worry about you first.

19
00:00:39.266 --> 00:00:41.766
Hello Chen Tezhu

20
00:00:41.766 --> 00:00:42.600
What!

21
00:00:42.733 --> 00:00:44.966
The civil group cancelled its cooperation with us.

22
00:00:44.966 --> 00:00:45.866
Pardon me?

23
00:00:45.866 --> 00:00:47.066
Chen Tezhu called

24
00:00:47.066 --> 00:00:49.500
Say we offended people we shouldn't have offended?

25
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.600
Isn't he going to eat?

26
00:00:52.333 --> 00:00:53.766
Master Li

27
00:00:53.766 --> 00:00:54.700
It's all my fault

28
00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:56.066
I don't know Tarzan

29
00:00:56.066 --> 00:00:58.000
Please forgive me once in a while

30
00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.266
Just give me one more chance! OK.

31
00:00:59.266 --> 00:01:00.300
Those who dare to bully me

32
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.966
Even if your Bai family goes bankrupt, you can't afford compensation

33
00:01:02.966 --> 00:01:03.866
No, Mr. Li

34
00:01:03.933 --> 00:01:05.033
Don't want Mr. Li

35
00:01:05.133 --> 00:01:07.833
Forget it, big brother, let's go. I'll let you go today.

36
00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:08.600
Next time

37
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.500
If you are blind, don't think about him standing still

38
00:01:13.966 --> 00:01:15.000
It's over.

39
00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:17.266
Offended Mr. Li

40
00:01:17.266 --> 00:01:19.766
These 11 items are gone.
