00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.066
Let's go in and get something.

2
00:00:02.333 --> 00:00:05.500
Ah Yaoyao, this is the box we prepared for you

3
00:00:05.533 --> 00:00:07.200
How is it?

4
00:00:07.366 --> 00:00:09.666
It's good, it's really a little small.

5
00:00:09.966 --> 00:00:10.966
But it doesn't matter.

6
00:00:10.966 --> 00:00:12.633
We're looking for fun, right?

7
00:00:13.666 --> 00:00:15.466
Come on

8
00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:18.300
Well, I asked them to upgrade the box.

9
00:00:19.366 --> 00:00:22.466
Students are willing to help you celebrate today's consumption

10
00:00:22.466 --> 00:00:23.566
Let me get this.

11
00:00:24.066 --> 00:00:25.566
Brother Gao Yang

12
00:00:25.566 --> 00:00:26.566
Better box

13
00:00:26.566 --> 00:00:28.333
You need to recharge to enter.

14
00:00:28.333 --> 00:00:30.966
Top boxes need to be recharged by more than 10 million

15
00:00:30.966 --> 00:00:32.600
And make an appointment in advance

16
00:00:32.766 --> 00:00:34.466
Premium rooms do not need to be reserved

17
00:00:34.466 --> 00:00:36.366
But you also need to recharge more than 3 million

18
00:00:36.366 --> 00:00:39.200
The last box should be recharged more than 1 million

19
00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.566
A private room is so expensive

20
00:00:41.766 --> 00:00:43.666
Why don't we just stay here?

21
00:00:43.666 --> 00:00:45.166
You think it's fine

22
00:00:45.166 --> 00:00:47.666
It's okay, I'll ask the waiter.

23
00:00:47.666 --> 00:00:49.900
Do you need to make a reservation for the top private room?

24
00:00:50.066 --> 00:00:51.866
Ouch Yaoyao

25
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:54.066
Because Weibo is too kind to you, right?

26
00:00:54.066 --> 00:00:54.866
Yes

27
00:00:55.266 --> 00:00:57.033
Hello, waiter. Hello, sir.

28
00:00:57.066 --> 00:00:59.300
Do you need to make a reservation for the top box on your side?

29
00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:00.700
There is only one top box.

30
00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.500
Tonight, our boss will stay with a friend to explain.

31
00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:03.400
I'm so sorry.

32
00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:06.200
You can choose between a premium box and a premium box.

33
00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:08.700
Then the premium box

34
00:01:09.066 --> 00:01:11.366
Premium boxes need to be recharged 3 million or more

35
00:01:11.566 --> 00:01:12.366
Ah.

36
00:01:13.066 --> 00:01:15.066
Okay, let's open one first

37
00:01:15.066 --> 00:01:16.266
Take them to rest

38
00:01:16.266 --> 00:01:17.233
I'll change it with you.

39
00:01:17.366 --> 00:01:19.166
Ok, no problem, please today.

40
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.200
You go to the box first

41
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.433
Let me take this.

42
00:01:28.066 --> 00:01:31.200
Here's your card, sir. Thank you.

43
00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:35.600
Box
