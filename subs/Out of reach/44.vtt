00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.666
Wang Shiyu, why are you here?

2
00:00:08.766 --> 00:00:10.900
Lin Feng heard that you moved

3
00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:13.566
I didn't expect to move to this zodiac villa.

4
00:00:13.566 --> 00:00:14.666
What's it to you?

5
00:00:14.666 --> 00:00:15.600
I came this time

6
00:00:15.933 --> 00:00:17.266
I'm apologizing to you.

7
00:00:17.266 --> 00:00:18.166
I am unemployed

8
00:00:18.166 --> 00:00:18.800
Lin Feng

9
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.000
These days I always think of your kindness to me

10
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.166
Give me another chance

11
00:00:22.166 --> 00:00:24.000
Let's start over, shall we?

12
00:00:24.466 --> 00:00:25.266
snort

13
00:00:28.266 --> 00:00:29.866
Brother Feng, look what I made for you.

14
00:00:30.333 --> 00:00:31.200
Why are you here?

15
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:32.566
I also want to ask you

16
00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:33.566
Why are you here?

17
00:00:34.766 --> 00:00:36.666
Feng bought me a villa with the same zodiac sign

18
00:00:36.666 --> 00:00:37.466
Right next door

19
00:00:37.466 --> 00:00:39.266
He bought you a villa, right?

20
00:00:39.266 --> 00:00:41.266
You and Feng Ge have broken up.

21
00:00:41.266 --> 00:00:43.133
You two are no longer related.

22
00:00:43.133 --> 00:00:44.566
If you say it's okay, then it's okay.

23
00:00:44.566 --> 00:00:46.300
At least I'm his ex-girlfriend

24
00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:47.300
Also on track

25
00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.766
And you are just a fish in his pond.

26
00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:51.400
Raymond Lam

27
00:00:52.766 --> 00:00:53.700
I have something else to do

28
00:00:53.866 --> 00:00:54.866
You guys are welcome

29
00:00:55.166 --> 00:00:56.533
Ahhh

30
00:00:58.066 --> 00:01:00.266
Lin Feng, this loser, actually caught me

31
00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.966
No, I can't hang myself on a tree.

32
00:01:03.066 --> 00:01:04.400
Got to find the next target.

00:01:04.566 --> 00:01:05.366
