00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:00.900
Hey master

2
00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:02.966
Can I really order whatever wine is on this wine list?

3
00:00:02.966 --> 00:00:05.300
Of course, a few bottles of wine are worth a few dollars

4
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.266
Drink whatever you want, I'll pay for it

5
00:00:07.366 --> 00:00:08.566
Then I'm welcome.

6
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:11.500
I've heard that the owner of Xihe Restaurant is an expert.

7
00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:12.733
There are a lot of good wines hidden

8
00:00:12.933 --> 00:00:16.400
You guys probably have a private wine list, right?

9
00:00:16.466 --> 00:00:17.300
Yes sir

10
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:18.900
It's just the boss's private collection of wine.

11
00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:20.000
The prices are expensive

12
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.133
Most people can't accept much.

13
00:00:22.133 --> 00:00:22.900
Can you

14
00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:24.933
Okay, I've already said it.

15
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:25.800
It's hard to catch up

16
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.966
Did you hear that?

17
00:00:26.966 --> 00:00:29.166
Today is our Gaoshao battlefield.

18
00:00:29.166 --> 00:00:31.200
Bring me your secret wine list.

19
00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:37.300
This is money grabbing

20
00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:38.366
What kind of wine sells for 800,000?

21
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:39.733
That's right, Raymond Lam

22
00:00:39.933 --> 00:00:41.300
We are all old classmates.

23
00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:42.533
That's almost enough.

24
00:00:42.533 --> 00:00:44.266
Don't deliberately make things difficult for Master Gao.

25
00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:44.866
that is

26
00:00:44.866 --> 00:00:46.700
If it weren't for Brother Jianxiang helping you in high school

27
00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:47.533
Those three melons and two dates

28
00:00:47.533 --> 00:00:48.100
Can there be today?

29
00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:49.366
Are you embarrassed?

30
00:00:49.366 --> 00:00:52.000
It's not up to you sycophants to decide.

31
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.300
Is Mr. Gao in trouble?

32
00:00:54.266 --> 00:00:56.366
It's not a big deal. What's the point of this little money?

33
00:00:56.933 --> 00:00:58.500
This is the 880,000

34
00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:59.466
I'll have a bottle

35
00:00:59.966 --> 00:01:00.666
Hey wait

36
00:01:00.666 --> 00:01:02.000
One bottle is not enough

37
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:03.133
wind

38
00:01:03.133 --> 00:01:04.166
You're taking it too far
