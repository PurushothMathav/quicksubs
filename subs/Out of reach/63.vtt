00:00:01.333 --> 00:00:02.133
10 billion

2
00:00:02.166 --> 00:00:03.300
Did I hear that correctly?

3
00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:04.300
What he said

4
00:00:04.366 --> 00:00:06.866
10 billion, this guy must be crazy

5
00:00:07.066 --> 00:00:09.066
10 billion to buy Xingyue Media

6
00:00:09.533 --> 00:00:12.133
Mr. Lin, are you sure you want 10 billion?

7
00:00:12.133 --> 00:00:12.933
Sure

8
00:00:13.733 --> 00:00:16.100
You must be lying.

9
00:00:16.166 --> 00:00:19.933
Even my Liu family can't come up with this 10 billion in cash

10
00:00:19.966 --> 00:00:21.966
You bumpkin upstart

11
00:00:22.066 --> 00:00:24.533
How can there be so much cash?

12
00:00:24.533 --> 00:00:25.566
I see

13
00:00:25.933 --> 00:00:27.666
You are disrupting the market rules.

14
00:00:27.666 --> 00:00:28.600
Random bidding

15
00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.966
Your Liu family can't come up with this 10 billion

16
00:00:31.666 --> 00:00:33.600
It doesn't mean that I, Raymond Lam, can't do it.

17
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.733
Bah, you're still pretending now that the time has come, right?

18
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:38.466
I require capital verification

19
00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.000
Mr. Lin followed the auction rules.

20
00:00:42.133 --> 00:00:44.500
We need to verify your capital before acquisition

21
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:45.300
Would you like to

22
00:00:45.466 --> 00:00:46.333
Capital verification is possible

23
00:00:46.333 --> 00:00:49.133
But I'm worried about blowing up your POS machines.

24
00:00:49.166 --> 00:00:50.800
I really think I'm a fat person

25
00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:52.000
Still trying to be strong here

26
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Haha if you are really that rich

27
00:00:54.933 --> 00:00:57.766
I gave him the license plate on the spot.

28
00:00:57.866 --> 00:00:59.933
Then Liu Shaoke will have a good time.

29
00:01:00.933 --> 00:01:03.066
There is no need to verify the capital anymore.

30
00:01:03.066 --> 00:01:05.200
I will just swipe away the 10 billion
