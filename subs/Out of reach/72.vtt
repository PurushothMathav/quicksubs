Lin

2
00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:05.400
Mr. Lin, you are the new boss of the Blue Moon Army.

3
00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:07.566
Haha come here

4
00:00:07.866 --> 00:00:09.500
I am his man

5
00:00:09.766 --> 00:00:12.400
Next I will advance him one year's salary

6
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.133
You dream of advancing my salary

7
00:00:14.133 --> 00:00:15.066
Don't even think about it

8
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.933
Mr. Li, I'll take care of the matter here.

9
00:00:17.933 --> 00:00:18.900
You go take a rest

10
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:20.300
ah

11
00:00:20.466 --> 00:00:23.133
I'm so scared, you dare to talk to me like this?

12
00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:25.266
I want to break up with you

13
00:00:25.566 --> 00:00:27.900
Break up, you want to dump me

14
00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:29.566
Give 1 million as breakup fee first

15
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.500
Otherwise you can't get rid of me

16
00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.500
I'm always pestering you

17
00:00:34.766 --> 00:00:35.566
million

18
00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.200
Are you crazy about money?

19
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.066
Where can I find so much money for you?

20
00:00:40.566 --> 00:00:41.600
I paid this money.

21
00:00:41.866 --> 00:00:45.366
Is it worth spending 1 million to get rid of a scumbag?

22
00:00:45.666 --> 00:00:47.200
Mr. Lin, that's not what I meant.

23
00:00:47.366 --> 00:00:50.000
Okay, I said you have been a broadcaster for so long.

24
00:00:50.066 --> 00:00:51.333
Why didn't I meet a big brother?

25
00:00:51.766 --> 00:00:54.533
It turns out that she is having an affair with the company boss.

26
00:00:56.133 --> 00:00:56.933
Don't talk nonsense

27
00:00:56.933 --> 00:00:58.500
I don't have 5 million

28
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.500
Yes, yes, what is 5 million?

29
00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:02.933
Don't you just want money?

30
00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:05.733
I can give you 5 million as a breakup fee.

31
00:01:05.733 --> 00:01:06.900
But you have to promise

32
00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.566
From now on, you have to disappear from the world of military parades

33
00:01:10.566 --> 00:01:13.400
I didn't expect this stinky thing to be worth so much money

34
00:01:13.666 --> 00:01:15.733
No, then I'm leaving.

35
00:01:15.733 --> 00:01:17.800
Hey hey hey ah

36
00:01:17.933 --> 00:01:19.100
What do you want to do?
