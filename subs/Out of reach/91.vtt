1
00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:01.066
Then give it a try

2
00:00:01.066 --> 00:00:03.166
I have seen Li Shao's strength

3
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:04.466
So next

4
00:00:04.566 --> 00:00:05.900
Let Li Shao see it for himself

5
00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:07.733
My strength as an upstart

6
00:00:07.733 --> 00:00:10.933
I will let the top ten on this list later

7
00:00:11.166 --> 00:00:12.466
All of us are stars and moon

8
00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:14.766
Oh, it's installed.

9
00:00:15.333 --> 00:00:16.333
Top 10

10
00:00:16.733 --> 00:00:19.166
You're talking big regardless of the occasion now, right?

11
00:00:19.466 --> 00:00:19.933
Pack

12
00:00:19.933 --> 00:00:21.133
Keep pretending.

13
00:00:21.333 --> 00:00:23.933
If you can, show me one.

14
00:00:24.166 --> 00:00:26.500
It's still in the top ten

15
00:00:26.966 --> 00:00:28.600
What's the use of bragging?

16
00:00:28.666 --> 00:00:30.000
Did you say big words?

17
00:00:30.366 --> 00:00:32.133
You'll know after you wait and see.

18
00:00:34.566 --> 00:00:35.900
Hello General Manager

19
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.866
Notify all employees of our company

20
00:00:37.933 --> 00:00:39.500
Put down what you are doing immediately

21
00:00:39.533 --> 00:00:42.133
Each person registers an account on our live streaming platform

22
00:00:42.133 --> 00:00:43.766
Give gifts to our anchor

23
00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.200
The money will not be deposited into the public account.

24
00:00:46.466 --> 00:00:47.733
It's Mr. Li Linfang

25
00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.500
Now you are bringing shame upon the entire company, right?

26
00:00:50.566 --> 00:00:53.466
Okay, I want to see how long you can pretend

27
00:00:53.466 --> 00:00:55.066
Look, the second one moved

28
00:00:55.066 --> 00:00:56.500
20 billion

29
00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:59.266
Li Feier of Xingyue Media has made great achievements

30
00:00:59.333 --> 00:01:01.933
Crush the crowd with a contribution value of 20 billion

31
00:01:02.366 --> 00:01:03.166
How is it possible?

32
00:01:04.533 --> 00:01:05.866
How come you are so strong?
