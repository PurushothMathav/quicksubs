00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.500
Who can prove that I broke this tea set?

2
00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:03.300
Can you prove it?

3
00:00:03.366 --> 00:00:04.566
Who says there is no evidence?

4
00:00:05.533 --> 00:00:07.466
There is no surveillance in this room.

5
00:00:07.466 --> 00:00:10.900
But I just cleaned this tea set.

6
00:00:12.133 --> 00:00:13.066
That is to say

7
00:00:13.266 --> 00:00:15.500
If I send this tea set fragment

8
00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:20.266
You, Master Chen, are the only one who knows this.

9
00:00:20.566 --> 00:00:21.366
snort

10
00:00:22.133 --> 00:00:23.200
Okay, I won't tease you anymore.

11
00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.300
This one hundred million is nothing to me.

12
00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:26.566
Just sprinkle some water

13
00:00:26.566 --> 00:00:27.600
If it breaks, it breaks.

14
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:28.800
It's you, Phil.

15
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.266
You should remember this next time.

16
00:00:30.266 --> 00:00:33.066
What I give others cannot afford

17
00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:35.066
I see

18
00:00:36.166 --> 00:00:37.300
What are you still standing there for?

19
00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:38.766
If you don't get out of here, you'll have to pay the money.

20
00:00:40.366 --> 00:00:41.166
good

21
00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:42.733
I'm coming

22
00:00:44.166 --> 00:00:44.966
snort

23
00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:48.300
snort

24
00:00:49.733 --> 00:00:51.300
Oh, oh, oh, oh

25
00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.600
That Lu Feng

26
00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:53.566
Why don't we discuss it?

27
00:00:53.566 --> 00:00:55.466
The lifelong event between you and Fei'er

28
00:00:55.466 --> 00:00:56.500
Lifetime Events

29
00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:57.400
Yes, yes.

30
00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.266
The goddess of Philippine is so popular

31
00:00:59.266 --> 00:01:01.900
It shouldn't be difficult to find a horse while riding a donkey.

32
00:01:03.133 --> 00:01:04.466
Hey hey hey

33
00:01:04.566 --> 00:01:06.466
Brother Feng, Brother Feng

34
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.100
Look at the good things you did.

35
00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.333
The wind brother was mad and left

36
00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.900
Oops, I scratched it wrong.

37
00:01:15.966 --> 00:01:18.800
But you have to hold on to this wind.

38
00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.466
That's right, everyone's success is all thanks to him.

39
00:01:21.466 --> 00:01:23.800
Hey
