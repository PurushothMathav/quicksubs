00:00:00.766 --> 00:00:02.400
Fei'er, just listen to what Mr. Liu says.

2
00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:03.466
If you can't change the money

3
00:00:04.133 --> 00:00:05.733
He would have blown me up.

4
00:00:05.733 --> 00:00:07.400
You can say this.

5
00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:10.966
Fei'er's dad will kneel down and kowtow to you, okay?

6
00:00:10.966 --> 00:00:11.766
Mayfair

7
00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:13.933
What a loving father-daughter drama

8
00:00:13.933 --> 00:00:15.133
This is the first time I've seen

9
00:00:15.133 --> 00:00:16.933
The father took the initiative to buy his daughter's

10
00:00:17.466 --> 00:00:19.000
You you you know shit

11
00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:20.100
Can tie up the rich

12
00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.366
It was the blessing his daughter had earned in her previous life.

13
00:00:22.566 --> 00:00:24.333
Well said

14
00:00:24.333 --> 00:00:26.566
Mr. Li is still very clear-headed.

15
00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:27.933
Ahahahaha

16
00:00:27.933 --> 00:00:31.566
Marrying a rich man is much better than watching TV anchors

17
00:00:31.733 --> 00:00:35.266
However, based on Miss Li's beauty

18
00:00:35.366 --> 00:00:38.100
What if you don't want to follow those old guys?

19
00:00:38.266 --> 00:00:41.066
It's not impossible to follow me.

20
00:00:41.066 --> 00:00:43.200
Ahahahahaha

21
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.733
If I'm not mistaken

22
00:00:44.966 --> 00:00:47.000
Your first target should be him.

23
00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:48.933
Debts must be repaid

24
00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:50.100
People also need

25
00:00:50.333 --> 00:00:52.066
Your line is long enough.

26
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:53.366
What does it mean?

27
00:00:53.366 --> 00:00:56.966
I have heard that some major forces are using debt as an excuse.

28
00:00:57.066 --> 00:01:00.133
Force families to offer their daughters to various wealthy families

29
00:01:00.133 --> 00:01:01.000
Profit from it

30
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.266
That's what you do, right?

31
00:01:02.266 --> 00:01:03.933
Even if you knew it, what would it matter?

32
00:01:04.366 --> 00:01:06.666
The IOU is in my hand.

33
00:01:06.666 --> 00:01:08.166
According to the rules of the road

34
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.466
Today, the Li family must pay the price

35
00:01:14.166 --> 00:01:16.400
50 million for two hands

36
00:01:17.066 --> 00:01:19.966
Isn't it too cheap for you?
