Why hasn't Lin Feng contacted me yet?

No, I have to take the initiative.

Is it worthy?

00:01:10.533 --> 00:01:11.600
Let's talk about it after we meet someone.

25
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:12.766
Hey, hey, good, good

26
00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.600
Mom and Dad, why are you in my house?

27
00:01:23.366 --> 00:01:25.333
Isn't this for your life?

This is obviously the material for giving birth to a son, hahahaha

32
00:01:35.933 --> 00:01:37.400
Your dad

33
00:01:37.466 --> 00:01:38.733
Aren't you selling your daughter?

34
00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:41.700
Oh, Phil.

35
00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.766
Why are you saying this so harshly?

36
00:01:44.766 --> 00:01:47.466
Mom and Dad, isn't this for your own good?

00:01:47.533 --> 00:01:49.666
