00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:04.066
I want to see how hard your tea set is.

2
00:00:06.933 --> 00:00:08.766
Isn't it just a street stall product?

3
00:00:08.766 --> 00:00:10.100
It breaks when it falls.

4
00:00:12.366 --> 00:00:14.100
It's really a waste of natural resources.

5
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:15.933
I have such a good tea set hum

6
00:00:15.933 --> 00:00:19.266
I was smashed by a blind ass like you.

7
00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.966
Now you smashed my tea set, you have to pay for it

8
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.133
Why do you want me to compensate you?

9
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.133
Is 100 yuan enough?

10
00:00:27.733 --> 00:00:29.700
How much do you want?

11
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:31.000
How much money do I give you?

12
00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:33.100
several thousand

13
00:00:33.933 --> 00:00:35.366
Hum 10,000

14
00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:36.300
100 million

15
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:40.266
100 million is your broken tea set worth 100 million

16
00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:44.000
How come Mr. Chen can't even come up with 100 million?

17
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.933
I'll accompany you. Your broken tea set is worth 100 million.

18
00:00:46.966 --> 00:00:48.666
What if it's really worth 100 million?

19
00:00:48.666 --> 00:00:49.900
If it's really worth 100 million

20
00:00:50.133 --> 00:00:52.400
I ate this fragment.

21
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:53.400
This is what you said

22
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:53.933
Um

23
00:00:53.933 --> 00:00:56.466
Although my tea set looks ordinary

24
00:00:56.466 --> 00:00:59.200
It is the tea set used by Emperor Qianlong of the Qing Dynasty

25
00:01:00.966 --> 00:01:02.500
Emperor Qianlong of the Qing Dynasty

26
00:01:02.733 --> 00:01:04.566
I don't even need to beg

27
00:01:04.966 --> 00:01:06.666
Fortunately, I have seen more of the world than you.

28
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:08.300
Brat

29
00:01:08.933 --> 00:01:10.400
Uh-huh

30
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.533
Ah, I can tell if it's a human or a ghost by just scanning it
