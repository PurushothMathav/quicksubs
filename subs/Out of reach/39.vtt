00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.200
Is it a human or a ghost?

2
00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:02.566
Scan to know

3
00:00:08.266 --> 00:00:09.466
What happened to the license?

4
00:00:10.366 --> 00:00:12.366
Hey hey hey

5
00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.200
The gap is actually 100 million.

6
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.133
But there's a lot of money.

7
00:00:18.133 --> 00:00:18.933
Hey hey hey

8
00:00:19.333 --> 00:00:21.133
Oops Oops Oops

9
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:24.800
Braiding

10
00:00:24.866 --> 00:00:25.500
this this this this

11
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:26.733
Even though it was broken

12
00:00:26.766 --> 00:00:29.100
But this standing together should be very valuable

13
00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:29.900
Maybe

14
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.533
Hey hey hey oops

15
00:00:34.333 --> 00:00:37.266
How can a tea set be so priceless?

16
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:38.600
Who are you?

17
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.366
How do rich people

18
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.600
Mr. Chen, you should pay the money now.

19
00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:44.366
I'll do this.

20
00:00:44.366 --> 00:00:45.100
You just said

21
00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:47.666
My tea set is more expensive than your 5 million tea leaves.

22
00:00:47.666 --> 00:00:49.133
You eat this fragment.

23
00:00:49.133 --> 00:00:51.533
If you eat the fragments today

24
00:00:51.533 --> 00:00:53.333
You don't have to pay this money.

25
00:00:53.566 --> 00:00:55.300
Ask me to lose money and dream

26
00:00:55.366 --> 00:00:56.066
Uncle Lee

27
00:00:56.066 --> 00:00:59.000
This is the son-in-law you worked so hard to recruit.

28
00:00:59.166 --> 00:01:00.600
The reputation is not very good

29
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.266
Old man, your daughter has already hooked up with a rich man

30
00:01:03.366 --> 00:01:04.700
Why did you call me here?

31
00:01:12.333 --> 00:01:14.666
How come this tiny dog ​​is so strong?

32
00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:19.166
You broke my things and wanted to leave without paying for them.

33
00:01:19.466 --> 00:01:20.600
This room is so big.

34
00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:21.733
There is no monitoring

35
00:01:21.766 --> 00:01:24.133
Who can prove that I broke this tea set?

36
00:01:24.133 --> 00:01:24.933
Can you prove it?

37
00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.266
Who said there is no evidence?
