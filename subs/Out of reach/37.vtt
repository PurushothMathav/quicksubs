00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.500
Why spend 5 million to buy a can of fake Dahongpao tea?

2
00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:06.333
This is fake. This is fake.

3
00:00:06.666 --> 00:00:08.400
What nonsense is the kid talking about?

4
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:09.333
This red robe

5
00:00:09.566 --> 00:00:12.366
But I spent a lot of effort to find someone to buy it.

6
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.566
This crappy tea leaves need someone to buy it for you

7
00:00:14.566 --> 00:00:16.200
If you don't talk about it, who will?

8
00:00:22.533 --> 00:00:23.333
Um

9
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.866
This tea is only 39.9 yuan

10
00:00:26.866 --> 00:00:28.966
I said if you have any brains

11
00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:32.533
You won't be fooled by this little trick.

12
00:00:32.566 --> 00:00:37.566
I spent 5 million to buy the same fake tea on Taobao

13
00:00:37.566 --> 00:00:39.933
If you say you are not stupid, then who is stupid?

14
00:00:40.566 --> 00:00:41.933
Is authenticity that important?

15
00:00:42.066 --> 00:00:43.733
Since I spent 5 million to buy it

16
00:00:43.733 --> 00:00:45.266
Then he is worth 5 million

17
00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:46.500
It's you

18
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.900
You use such a cheap product to deceive Fei'er.

19
00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:51.166
What's your intention?

20
00:00:51.166 --> 00:00:53.466
I think it's you who is cheating.

21
00:00:53.866 --> 00:00:55.933
Sister-in-law, if you dare to speak nonsense again

22
00:00:55.933 --> 00:00:57.100
I will tear your mouth apart

23
00:00:57.133 --> 00:00:59.800
How come you broke down after just a few words?

24
00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.366
It seems that your title as the eldest son of the Chen family is very exaggerated.

25
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.100
good

26
00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.100
You said your broken tea set is more expensive than my Da Hong Pao, right?

27
00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.200
I'd like to see

28
00:01:14.166 --> 00:01:14.966
How hard
