00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.266
The Chen family is a big family in Beijing.

2
00:00:02.266 --> 00:00:03.600
You have to grasp it well

3
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.133
Mom and Dad, I already have Raymond Lam

4
00:00:06.133 --> 00:00:07.966
You don't need to introduce me to a blind date.

5
00:00:07.966 --> 00:00:11.866
Oh, this Chen Shao is much richer than this Lin Feng

6
00:00:12.933 --> 00:00:14.133
Really

7
00:00:14.366 --> 00:00:15.366
That's natural

8
00:00:15.366 --> 00:00:18.533
My Chen family's asset ranking in this province

9
00:00:18.533 --> 00:00:20.466
That's one of the best.

10
00:00:20.466 --> 00:00:22.700
I am a real rich second generation

11
00:00:22.733 --> 00:00:23.966
If you are a rich second generation

12
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.500
Then I am your father.

13
00:00:25.533 --> 00:00:27.500
What is the rich generation?

14
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.533
What if Chen Tiansheng is really richer than Raymond Lam?

15
00:00:32.533 --> 00:00:34.866
Brother Feng, I have something to deal with today.

16
00:00:34.866 --> 00:00:36.766
Why don't you go back first?

17
00:00:36.933 --> 00:00:38.133
Pfeiffer

18
00:00:38.266 --> 00:00:40.466
If you let go of me, this towering tree

19
00:00:40.466 --> 00:00:41.800
But I can't report it anymore.

20
00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.966
I I

21
00:00:41.966 --> 00:00:43.800
That's not what I meant.

22
00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.000
You can rest assured

23
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.166
There is no one richer than me in this world

24
00:00:48.266 --> 00:00:49.066
snort

25
00:00:49.466 --> 00:00:51.000
Arrogant sister-in-law

26
00:00:51.133 --> 00:00:53.000
You know there are people outside of you

27
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.066
There is always someone better

28
00:00:55.566 --> 00:00:56.133
Uncle Li

29
00:00:56.133 --> 00:00:59.100
Your daughter's looks are quite to my liking.

30
00:00:59.266 --> 00:01:01.966
Why not contact them first?

31
00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.900
Oh, of course you can

32
00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:05.200
Hahahaha

33
00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:06.400
By the way, you said

34
00:01:06.533 --> 00:01:08.066
This is my special commission

35
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.000
Dahongpao tea leaves picked from mother trees in Wuyi Mountain

36
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.266
Value 5 million

37
00:01:12.366 --> 00:01:13.166
Ouch

38
00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:17.600
This is a meeting gift.
