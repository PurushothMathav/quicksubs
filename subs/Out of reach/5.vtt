00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:00.966
Excuse me

2
00:00:00.966 --> 00:00:03.400
If you don't buy it, I'll take it.

3
00:00:03.466 --> 00:00:06.566
Can you afford 300 yuan from your pocket?

4
00:00:06.566 --> 00:00:07.666
Can you afford it?

5
00:00:09.533 --> 00:00:10.333
Why

6
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:11.333
This beauty

7
00:00:11.333 --> 00:00:13.066
Don't be fooled by this jerk.

8
00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:15.733
Look at the poorness that emanates from him.

9
00:00:16.166 --> 00:00:17.700
How can I afford it?

10
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.966
Don't wait until you can't pay when you check out

11
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:21.966
It's so embarrassing.

12
00:00:22.266 --> 00:00:23.166
This gentleman

13
00:00:23.266 --> 00:00:24.900
This bag is worth 100,000

14
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.566
How much money did I have?

15
00:00:26.766 --> 00:00:27.700
It turned out to be only 100,000

16
00:00:27.733 --> 00:00:30.566
Haha, these, these, these

17
00:00:30.566 --> 00:00:31.466
Pack them all for me

18
00:00:32.966 --> 00:00:34.966
Ling Feng, you really put it on, didn't you?

19
00:00:34.966 --> 00:00:37.100
Do you know how much these bags cost?

20
00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.966
I'm afraid even if you find ten more gods they still won't be enough hahahaha

21
00:00:39.966 --> 00:00:42.100
This is not something you need to worry about.

22
00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.300
Sir, please stop joking.

23
00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:45.100
Let him buy

24
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.300
I want to see how you can justify this boast.

25
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:50.800
What if I can afford it?

26
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:51.933
You really have to afford it

27
00:00:51.933 --> 00:00:53.566
I kneel down and call you grandpa

28
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.266
But what if you can't afford it?

29
00:00:56.266 --> 00:00:57.500
I can't afford it

30
00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.333
I'd better sell my kidney

31
00:01:00.133 --> 00:01:03.000
I want to see this dog licking thing

32
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:03.800
Grab Card

33
00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.966
You really think you're showing off by pulling out a card

34
00:01:07.966 --> 00:01:09.566
Will I look upon you with new eyes?

35
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:10.666
I tell you

36
00:01:10.666 --> 00:01:11.900
You're a piece of shit.

37
00:01:11.966 --> 00:01:14.300
The bigger the bullshit, the stinkier the shit

38
00:01:14.533 --> 00:01:15.333
Catch it
