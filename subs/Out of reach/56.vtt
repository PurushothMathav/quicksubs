00:00:00.466 --> 00:00:02.900
Brother Feng, what do you think if I resign?

2
00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:04.766
Will you support me?

3
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:07.733
As long as you listen

4
00:00:08.066 --> 00:00:10.000
Of course, but

5
00:00:10.066 --> 00:00:10.900
But what

6
00:00:11.333 --> 00:00:12.500
Xingyue Media

7
00:00:12.766 --> 00:00:14.166
I must buy

8
00:00:14.333 --> 00:00:15.166
Why?

9
00:00:15.566 --> 00:00:17.566
Liu Tianhu is ruthless

10
00:00:17.566 --> 00:00:19.000
If we offend him

11
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.700
The days after this will be tough.

12
00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:22.666
Xingyue Media

13
00:00:22.733 --> 00:00:25.200
A group of gold diggers who live on the rewards of the big brother

14
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:26.766
How could I let go?

15
00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.666
This is an opportunity to make huge profits.

16
00:00:29.533 --> 00:00:30.933
Phil, think about it.

17
00:00:31.133 --> 00:00:33.000
Once the company fell into his hands

18
00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:34.666
Don't talk about resigning then.

19
00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:36.666
Even the female anchors under the company

20
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.466
They will become his tools to make money violently

21
00:00:39.733 --> 00:00:40.733
What to do then?

22
00:00:42.566 --> 00:00:43.366
Um

23
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.000
The only way now is

24
00:00:45.133 --> 00:00:46.766
No matter what the cost

25
00:00:46.966 --> 00:00:49.066
Must successfully acquire Xingyue Media

26
00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.900
Um

27
00:00:50.166 --> 00:00:50.966
Raymond Lam

28
00:00:53.866 --> 00:00:54.966
How come you are here?

29
00:00:55.866 --> 00:00:58.900
I'm here to interview for the position of anchorwoman

30
00:00:58.966 --> 00:01:00.300
You don't know yet?

31
00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.333
Liu Group is about to acquire Xingyue Media

32
00:01:03.366 --> 00:01:05.166
With the help of Liu Group

33
00:01:05.166 --> 00:01:06.200
This Star Moon Media

34
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.533
It will definitely become the leader in the industry

35
00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.133
With my talent and looks

36
00:01:11.133 --> 00:01:14.700
I'm sure I'll be able to make a name for myself in this industry.

37
00:01:14.933 --> 00:01:17.200
At that time, Liu Tianhu

38
00:01:17.766 --> 00:01:19.533
Still can't acquire Xingyue Media
