00:00:00.466 --> 00:00:02.766
Mr. Qian, you are not mistaken, are you?

2
00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:04.300
The acquisition of Xingyue Media

3
00:00:04.366 --> 00:00:06.333
At least 1 billion is needed.

4
00:00:06.333 --> 00:00:08.766
He is a jobless vagrant.

5
00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:09.700
How could this happen?

6
00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.933
This lady

7
00:00:10.933 --> 00:00:13.933
The account provided by Mr. Lin does have sufficient funds.

8
00:00:13.933 --> 00:00:15.400
There is no doubt about this

9
00:00:15.866 --> 00:00:16.933
Oh, this lady

10
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.100
We have an acquisition meeting later.

11
00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:21.200
If you want an interview, please come back another day.

12
00:00:23.166 --> 00:00:24.166
Mr. Lin, this is

13
00:00:24.166 --> 00:00:25.466
Please me

14
00:00:27.866 --> 00:00:30.133
Mr. Lin, I'll get straight to the point.

15
00:00:30.333 --> 00:00:32.300
Who acquired Xingyue Group today?

16
00:00:32.333 --> 00:00:33.166
Except you

17
00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:34.766
And Liu Tianhu from the Liu family

18
00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:37.500
The Liu family is nothing to fear

19
00:00:37.666 --> 00:00:40.166
Mr. Lin, I'm afraid you don't know the Liu family yet.

20
00:00:40.166 --> 00:00:41.766
Deeply rooted in the province

21
00:00:41.766 --> 00:00:42.700
Just you alone

22
00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:43.733
I'm afraid it's hard to shake

23
00:00:43.733 --> 00:00:47.200
I can defeat thousands of troops alone

24
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.966
Today, don't say he is a Liu family

25
00:00:50.966 --> 00:00:52.666
Even if there are ten Liu families

26
00:00:53.133 --> 00:00:55.666
It can't stop me from acquiring Xingyue Media

27
00:00:56.133 --> 00:00:57.866
Since Mr. Lin is so confident

28
00:00:57.866 --> 00:00:59.966
I wish Mr. Lin immediate success.

29
00:01:01.966 --> 00:01:04.366
I thought someone was pretending

30
00:01:07.133 --> 00:01:10.766
It turns out it's you, a country bumpkin upstart
