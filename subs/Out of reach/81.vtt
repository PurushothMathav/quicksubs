1
00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.700
Li Feng, who gave you the courage?

2
00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:06.200
Let you break into my Liu family alone

3
00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:07.500
To deal with your Liu family

4
00:00:07.766 --> 00:00:09.300
I am enough alone

5
00:00:09.533 --> 00:00:11.200
On my territory

6
00:00:11.266 --> 00:00:13.500
Why are you still pretending to be Lei Feng?

7
00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:16.133
Don't you just have some dirty money?

8
00:00:16.133 --> 00:00:17.200
What else do you have?

9
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:19.733
Otherwise, I'll pee on you.

10
00:00:19.766 --> 00:00:21.500
Take good care of yourself

11
00:00:21.866 --> 00:00:24.400
You should be the one to identify yourself

12
00:00:24.933 --> 00:00:26.500
Hum Li Feng

13
00:00:26.933 --> 00:00:30.200
There are only two paths before you now.

14
00:00:30.266 --> 00:00:34.566
First, you bought Xingyue Media for 10 billion.

15
00:00:34.866 --> 00:00:37.200
5 billion transferred to me

16
00:00:37.333 --> 00:00:39.466
Want me to sell Xingyue Media at a discount

17
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.733
Just dream on. Don't worry.

18
00:00:41.966 --> 00:00:43.333
I haven't finished yet.

19
00:00:43.533 --> 00:00:45.866
Second, these two

20
00:00:46.133 --> 00:00:49.366
He is a warrior that my Liu family has raised for more than ten years.

21
00:00:49.366 --> 00:00:52.766
If you don't hand over Xingyue Media to me

22
00:00:52.933 --> 00:00:56.533
Then I'll have to use some special means.

23
00:00:56.733 --> 00:00:57.533
cut

24
00:00:57.933 --> 00:00:59.200
And your employees.

25
00:01:01.266 --> 00:01:05.533
Then I will have to take responsibility for your mistakes.

26
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.200
Just a few of them

27
00:01:07.333 --> 00:01:08.766
What special means are there?

28
00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:13.166
Are you ready to drink the wine for punishment if you don't accept my toast?

29
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.300
I'm going to have some fun in front of you today.

30
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.466
Try moving again.

31
00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:24.966
What am I afraid of?
