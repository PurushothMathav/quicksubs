00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:01.066
Lin

2
00:00:01.066 --> 00:00:02.566
Stop gloating over other people's misfortunes.

3
00:00:04.266 --> 00:00:05.266
Lingfeng Lingfeng

4
00:00:05.266 --> 00:00:07.100
Please save me.

5
00:00:07.333 --> 00:00:08.866
Why do you just save me?

6
00:00:08.866 --> 00:00:11.166
I'm willing to do whatever you want me to do.

7
00:00:11.533 --> 00:00:12.333
OK

8
00:00:13.066 --> 00:00:15.066
Then you learn to bark like a dog

9
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.133
I counted it.

10
00:00:17.966 --> 00:00:19.300
The feud between the two of us

11
00:00:19.366 --> 00:00:21.733
You can't just learn to bark like a dog and settle the score.

12
00:00:22.133 --> 00:00:24.966
Xu Banshan hitting a woman is not a gentleman's behavior

13
00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.000
Besides, this is a public place.

14
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.333
It seems that this handsome boy is going to be a hero and save the beauty.

15
00:00:31.966 --> 00:00:33.200
Saving beauty is not the point

16
00:00:33.766 --> 00:00:37.166
It's just that this dog-eat-dog scene disturbed the clearing of boundaries.

17
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:38.533
Mrs. Chen

18
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.800
He must be a well-known and influential person.

19
00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:44.400
If someone spreads that your private life is not in order

20
00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.066
Keeping a gigolo

21
00:00:46.766 --> 00:00:48.166
Then you can record it

22
00:00:48.166 --> 00:00:49.866
Get out of here with all the recordings

23
00:00:51.333 --> 00:00:52.133
Mrs. Chen

24
00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.500
If you don't do crisis public relations

25
00:00:54.933 --> 00:00:56.400
It will be on the hot search soon

26
00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.366
Why are you still standing there?

27
00:01:03.766 --> 00:01:05.533
Looks like it's time for a strategy
