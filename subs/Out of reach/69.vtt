00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:01.300
Your phone is broken.

2
00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:03.266
It's okay, just fix it.

3
00:00:03.266 --> 00:00:04.466
I'll get you a new one.

4
00:00:05.066 --> 00:00:06.333
No, no need

5
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.300
There is no need to change to a new one

6
00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:10.566
Tell the finance department

7
00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:12.133
To all employees

8
00:00:12.133 --> 00:00:15.533
Each person will receive a brand new iPhone 15 top configuration

9
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.466
Oh, okay.

10
00:00:17.666 --> 00:00:18.466
Thank you Mr. Lin

11
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.933
Military parade, look how good General Lin is to you.

12
00:00:20.933 --> 00:00:22.066
Because I changed my phone for you alone

13
00:00:22.066 --> 00:00:23.300
Replaced for all of us.

14
00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:24.566
I just take advantage of you

15
00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.733
I didn't expect the new CEO to be so young and handsome.

16
00:00:28.133 --> 00:00:29.533
This is not the most important

17
00:00:29.533 --> 00:00:31.000
The most important thing is to have this

18
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.766
I heard that he recently acquired Crescent Moon

19
00:00:33.766 --> 00:00:35.400
It cost 10 billion.

20
00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:37.766
When the sister strategy

21
00:00:37.766 --> 00:00:39.133
She became the boss lady.

22
00:00:39.133 --> 00:00:41.066
No more need to appease those stupid brothers

23
00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.733
Feng Ge

24
00:00:43.733 --> 00:00:45.766
Let me show you around the work environment.

25
00:00:47.066 --> 00:00:50.400
Mr. Lin, I recently wrote a new live broadcast script

26
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:51.700
Please help me take a look

27
00:00:52.933 --> 00:00:53.733
What to watch

28
00:00:54.066 --> 00:00:57.000
I hate that you are my boss.

29
00:00:57.066 --> 00:00:58.800
Of course, you can watch whatever you want.
