Come eat in my room.

5
00:00:21.133 --> 00:00:22.000
Where is the Blue Guard?

6

You'll play here.

Money? No money.

13
00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:40.900
You always have a credit card, right?

14
00:00:40.933 --> 00:00:43.100
Meng Fei, I really have no money.

15
00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:44.333

Can you afford a new phone?

19
00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.533
This is a benefit given by the company boss to employees

20

All companies have

21
00:00:54.333 --> 00:00:55.666
Do you think I'm stupid?

22
00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:56.866
Which company boss?

23
00:00:56.866 --> 00:00:59.300
Can I afford to give top-of-the-line Apple products to the whole company?

24
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.600
Princess, let's stop gambling.

25
00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.666
Please, we don't have money to gamble anymore, get out of here.

26

Aren't you a female anchor?

What did you say

30
00:01:11.866 --> 00:01:14.066
I told you to hug her thighs

31
00:01:14.466 --> 00:01:15.266
princess

32
00:01:16.133 --> 00:01:18.166
I rejected so many rich second-generations for you

33
00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.566
I've been following you for so many years

34
00:01:19.566 --> 00:01:21.333
You're asking me to do this now.

35
00:01:21.666 --> 00:01:23.600
Has your conscience been eaten by a dog?

36
00:01:23.766 --> 00:01:24.766
If I had known this earlier

37
00:01:24.766 --> 00:01:27.066
I should have dumped you a long time ago
