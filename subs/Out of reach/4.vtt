1
00:00:00.566 --> 00:00:01.933
We have broken up

2
00:00:01.933 --> 00:00:04.166
Lin Feng, you are still following me shamelessly

3
00:00:04.166 --> 00:00:06.066
Don't you feel particularly disgusting?

4
00:00:06.066 --> 00:00:07.466
Wang Shiyu's ex-girlfriend

5
00:00:07.466 --> 00:00:09.166
Favorability -100

6
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:10.933
You should stop being so sentimental.

7
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.666
I'm here to buy a bag for Fei'er

8
00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.366
Isn't this the internet celebrity Li Fei'er?

9
00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:16.500
Buy a bag

10
00:00:16.566 --> 00:00:19.800
Can you afford it as a bootlicker with a monthly salary of 3,000 yuan?

11
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:20.800
Who says I can't afford it?

12
00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:26.566
Why sell your kidney just to be a bootlicker? Hahaha

13
00:00:26.566 --> 00:00:28.166
It seems I picked the wrong place

14
00:00:28.166 --> 00:00:30.600
No, you picked it just right.

15
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.066
Just pick whatever you like.

16
00:00:32.066 --> 00:00:33.366
Then I really picked it

17
00:00:33.366 --> 00:00:34.366
Don't regret it

18
00:00:35.466 --> 00:00:36.266
Why

19
00:00:36.266 --> 00:00:38.600
Do you still have this limited edition?

20
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:39.333
Only one

21
00:00:39.333 --> 00:00:40.666
But this beauty is trying

22
00:00:41.366 --> 00:00:42.966
Raymond Lam, what big gift are you pretending to be?

23
00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.666
I'll show you how big the gap is between you and Xu Shao.

24
00:00:46.566 --> 00:00:48.966
Many people's birthdays are coming soon

25
00:00:48.966 --> 00:00:50.200
Didn't you just have your birthday?

26
00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:51.800
That's the solar birthday.

27
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.466
What about the lunar birthday?

28
00:00:53.666 --> 00:00:56.500
Can you give me this bag as a birthday present?

29
00:00:57.533 --> 00:00:59.533
Shiyu, you know I don't like girls who are too materialistic

30
00:00:59.533 --> 00:01:02.533
I believe you are not with me for money

31
00:01:02.666 --> 00:01:03.466
Right

32
00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:06.000
It turned out to be an embroidered pillow

33
00:01:06.466 --> 00:01:07.333
I'm sorry.

34
00:01:07.466 --> 00:01:10.100
If you don't buy it, I'll take it.
