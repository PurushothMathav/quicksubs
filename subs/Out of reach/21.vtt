00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:03.066
Boy, I advise you to stop meddling in other people's business.

2
00:00:03.066 --> 00:00:05.900
You can't afford to offend our group

3
00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:08.266
I'll take care of Li Fei'er's affairs

4
00:00:08.266 --> 00:00:09.400
Ouch you

5
00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:10.533
You take care of him

6
00:00:10.533 --> 00:00:12.600
What do you have to do with it?

7
00:00:13.133 --> 00:00:14.566
Look at your poor appearance.

8
00:00:14.766 --> 00:00:18.200
I can't even take out 500 yuan from my pocket.

9
00:00:18.266 --> 00:00:23.266
Do you want to chop off Li Zhiyuan's hands?

10
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.366
I can't chop off my hand today.

11
00:00:25.566 --> 00:00:26.600
But hum

12
00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:27.900
I see

13
00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.866
You won't rely on your delicate skin and tender flesh

14
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.666
I want to sell it for him.

15
00:00:32.666 --> 00:00:34.133
Ahahahaha

16
00:00:34.133 --> 00:00:35.700
Put away your dirty thoughts.

17
00:00:35.933 --> 00:00:37.866
I paid back the money for him today, haha

18
00:00:38.266 --> 00:00:39.500
You pay him back.

19
00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.166
Hahahaha

20
00:00:41.166 --> 00:00:43.733
You're not making a mistake, are you?

21
00:00:43.733 --> 00:00:45.333
This is 50 million

22
00:00:45.533 --> 00:00:47.266
Not 5,000

23
00:00:47.466 --> 00:00:48.266
I know

24
00:00:48.266 --> 00:00:49.166
Only 50 million

25
00:00:49.166 --> 00:00:50.066
I'll pay it back for him

26
00:00:51.166 --> 00:00:53.166
System, give me 50 million

27
00:00:53.166 --> 00:00:54.900
I have to pay off Li Feier's debt.

28
00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.166
No problem, check has been generated

29
00:01:07.166 --> 00:01:07.966
snort

30
00:01:08.966 --> 00:01:10.966
Give you 50 million

31
00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:12.866
uh-huh

32
00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.166
Oh, sister-in-law

33
00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:18.733
Are you teasing me?

34
00:01:18.933 --> 00:01:20.400
Are you playing house with me?

35
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.933
What if this check is real?

36
00:01:21.933 --> 00:01:22.533
snort

37
00:01:22.533 --> 00:01:24.466
What if it's fake?

38
00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.300
If it's fake

39
00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.066
Today, the three of us are at your disposal.

40
00:01:29.266 --> 00:01:30.066
good

41
00:01:31.366 --> 00:01:32.700
What if it's true?

42
00:01:32.966 --> 00:01:34.066
If it's true

43
00:01:34.066 --> 00:01:35.933
Not only can the two of them go

44
00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:40.466
And I will personally apologize to you.

45
00:01:40.533 --> 00:01:41.366
A promise is a promise

46
00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.200
good
