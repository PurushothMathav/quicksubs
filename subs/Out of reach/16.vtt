1
00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:01.966
Not even 500,000

2
00:00:02.166 --> 00:00:03.300
Then I'll leave.

3
00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:04.700
Don't.

4
00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:07.266
I am a gold digger

5
00:00:07.566 --> 00:00:08.933
I am a gold digger

6
00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:10.533
I am a gold digger

7
00:00:11.533 --> 00:00:12.666
Really cheap

8
00:00:13.133 --> 00:00:14.933
500,000 can buy your dignity

9
00:00:17.933 --> 00:00:18.933
Cashback successful

10
00:00:19.566 --> 00:00:20.766
This is really good money.

11
00:00:23.666 --> 00:00:24.533
Is it Raymond Lam?

12
00:00:25.166 --> 00:00:25.766
What's up?

13
00:00:25.766 --> 00:00:27.866
Didn't you say you wanted to have dinner with me this morning?

14
00:00:28.066 --> 00:00:28.866
Sent you the address.

15
00:00:28.866 --> 00:00:29.700
See you there.

16
00:00:34.566 --> 00:00:36.000
From the first time we met in the morning

17
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.566
You bought me bags and gifts.

18
00:00:38.566 --> 00:00:41.200
You're not just trying to piss off your ex-girlfriend, are you?

19
00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:42.166
You can't say that either.

20
00:00:42.666 --> 00:00:44.100
But you did help me vent.

21
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.400
I want to say that I am using you to make money, do you believe me?

22
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.466
I know you are my number one

23
00:00:49.466 --> 00:00:51.366
Brother, your guess is right.

24
00:00:51.366 --> 00:00:52.900
According to the rules of your live broadcast room

25
00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:54.533
Should you commit yourself to me?

26
00:00:54.533 --> 00:00:57.600
I'm not someone who can just give myself to you so easily.

27
00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:59.766
But there were a few moments today.

28
00:00:59.766 --> 00:01:02.500
Makes me feel in love

29
00:01:02.533 --> 00:01:03.700
A female sea king

30
00:01:03.766 --> 00:01:06.266
Looks like you need to cast a heavy line to catch this big fish.

31
00:01:06.533 --> 00:01:07.800
I feel you are special too.

32
00:01:08.366 --> 00:01:10.100
Oh, how special?

33
00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.566
I always feel that someone in the world should be nicer to you.

34
00:01:13.566 --> 00:01:16.300
You mean you're the one who treats me well?

35
00:01:16.333 --> 00:01:18.400
Are you saying I'm a dog licker?

36
00:01:19.133 --> 00:01:21.600
Maybe, but I'm more curious about

37
00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.133
If I really become that person

38
00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:24.333
What will happen to you?

39
00:01:24.333 --> 00:01:27.533
It depends on whether you have the ability.

40
00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.400
None of these 10 million have been successful.

41
00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:30.766
This is too difficult.

42
00:01:34.466 --> 00:01:35.266
What happened

43
00:01:35.266 --> 00:01:37.466
My dad is trapped at home by debt collectors.

44
00:01:37.466 --> 00:01:39.466
Ah, the opportunity has come.
