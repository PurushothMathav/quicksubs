00:00:00.566 --> 00:00:01.933
How can't

2
00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:03.700
If you can't do it, get out of here.

3
00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:05.400
Don't embarrass yourself here.

4
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.266
You, Liu Tianhu, are just a dog raised by others.

5
00:00:08.366 --> 00:00:09.733
You dare to take it for me here?

6
00:00:09.733 --> 00:00:13.666
Feifei, let's go.

7
00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:14.733
Lin

8
00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:18.466
I just want to see how long this dog life of yours can last

9
00:00:18.566 --> 00:00:20.600
You waded into muddy waters that you shouldn't have waded into.

10
00:00:20.766 --> 00:00:22.666
Dare to insult Li Shao

11
00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:25.333
Do you know what it will cost you?

12
00:00:25.533 --> 00:00:27.700
You will be torn into pieces

13
00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:29.533
Your loved ones

14
00:00:29.566 --> 00:00:32.966
Your family will be implicated because of you.

15
00:00:33.133 --> 00:00:37.366
Zhulian clan failed to acquire Xingyue Media

16
00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:40.300
I think you should go back and think of a solution first.

17
00:00:40.533 --> 00:00:42.400
How do you talk to your master when you get back?

18
00:00:48.466 --> 00:00:50.100
Brother Feng, you are so awesome

19
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.666
I knew you would acquire Crescent Media

20
00:00:53.166 --> 00:00:55.600
Why don't you call me boss?

21
00:00:55.966 --> 00:00:56.766
boss

22
00:01:01.566 --> 00:01:03.966
Ling Feng, have you really acquired Xingyue Media?

23
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.900
Yes, Brother Feng wants to be my boss.

24
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.733
Today, we spent 10 billion to acquire Xingyue Media.

25
00:01:10.066 --> 00:01:12.333
Miss Huang, I have to thank you for this.

26
00:01:12.733 --> 00:01:14.366
If you hadn't broken up with Feng Ge

27
00:01:14.566 --> 00:01:17.866
How did I meet such a good person like him?

28
00:01:19.533 --> 00:01:20.333
Ha ha
