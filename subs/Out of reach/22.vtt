00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.400
I will apologize to you in person.

2
00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:03.800
A word is a promise

3
00:00:04.466 --> 00:00:05.266
oops

4
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.666
Where is such a check?

5
00:00:07.933 --> 00:00:09.133
This silver

6
00:00:09.166 --> 00:00:11.266
Are you trying to kill our family?

7
00:00:11.866 --> 00:00:14.300
Lin Feng, is this check of yours real or fake?

8
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:15.366
If it's fake

9
00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:16.966
He won't even let you go.

10
00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.000
Xiaojing, is this check real or fake?

11
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.300
You can call the bank next week and ask

12
00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:23.333
The phone is on the back.

13
00:00:23.466 --> 00:00:24.733
Hum

14
00:00:24.733 --> 00:00:28.733
I want to see how you put this on today.

15
00:00:36.666 --> 00:00:37.466
bank

16
00:00:37.466 --> 00:00:39.533
The bank person replied,

17
00:00:40.566 --> 00:00:41.933
What did you say

18
00:00:42.166 --> 00:00:44.466
The bank said the check was valid.

19
00:00:44.533 --> 00:00:45.166
and

20
00:00:45.166 --> 00:00:48.066
This is a wordless check that only the Supreme VIP can write.

21
00:00:48.366 --> 00:00:50.366
What? This is impossible.

22
00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.066
What about the amount? Is the amount true?

23
00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:54.366
true

24
00:00:54.366 --> 00:00:55.733
The amount is true hahaha

25
00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.100
It seems you lost.

26
00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.266
Hey, hey, hey, get up

27
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:00.800
The money has been paid back

28
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.133
Okay, they can go.

29
00:01:03.266 --> 00:01:05.800
What did you leave behind?
