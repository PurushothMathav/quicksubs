1
00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:01.533
Price of 50 billion

2
00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:04.266
I guess the person behind you can't open it.

3
00:00:04.533 --> 00:00:06.466
Mr. Wang, you are a smart man.

4
00:00:06.866 --> 00:00:08.166
You know how to choose

5
00:00:08.266 --> 00:00:10.766
Give you 3 seconds to think about it 3

6
00:00:12.766 --> 00:00:14.200
250 billion

7
00:00:15.666 --> 00:00:16.566
I sold it

8
00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:18.366
Hahaha

9
00:00:18.366 --> 00:00:19.400
So I said

10
00:00:19.866 --> 00:00:22.166
Things that can be solved with money are not a big deal

11
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.366
After all, I'm just a stinking upstart with a little money.

12
00:00:25.466 --> 00:00:27.966
Mr. Li is as young and promising as you.

13
00:00:27.966 --> 00:00:29.800
That's really one in a thousand.

14
00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:31.166
Lin

15
00:00:31.166 --> 00:00:34.466
When did we sign the contract?

16
00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.533
How can a 50 billion acquisition contract be signed just like that?

17
00:00:38.933 --> 00:00:39.733
Play me

18
00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.766
Then there is no president Wang who will play tricks on people.

19
00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.766
Didn't I tell Mr. Wang before?

20
00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:44.500
I am this person

21
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.966
What I am best at is to return the favor with my own body.

22
00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:50.800
I'll give you 30 seconds

23
00:00:51.266 --> 00:00:52.900
Get me the USB drive.

24
00:00:54.566 --> 00:00:55.366
start

25
00:01:04.333 --> 00:01:08.800
Ahhhhh
