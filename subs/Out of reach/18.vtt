00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.366
Debts are what you need

2
00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:02.500
Don't Overdo It

3
00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:04.700
Be careful, this will be over soon.

4
00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:06.466
They owe me money.

5
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.300
What does it have to do with you?

6
00:00:08.466 --> 00:00:09.400
What are you?

7
00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:10.700
Li Fei'er is my woman

8
00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:11.700
You dare to touch her

9
00:00:11.733 --> 00:00:12.800
That's moving me.

10
00:00:12.866 --> 00:00:15.966
Boy, I advise you not to meddle in things that are not your business.

11
00:00:16.133 --> 00:00:17.200
Whether it is manageable or not

12
00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:18.900
It's none of your business

13
00:00:19.866 --> 00:00:21.133
Please do me a favor.

14
00:00:22.466 --> 00:00:24.766
But the IOU is 50 million

15
00:00:26.166 --> 00:00:28.466
This 50 million must have a lot of interest

16
00:00:28.466 --> 00:00:31.200
If you borrow money from me, you have to follow my rules.

17
00:00:31.333 --> 00:00:32.900
We don't recognize this IOU

18
00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:33.800
What's the meaning

19
00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:34.966
It's your trap.

20
00:00:34.966 --> 00:00:36.600
That's why my dad borrowed so much money.

21
00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:38.400
No matter if this is a trap or not

22
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:42.800
It is a fact that your Li Company borrowed 50 million from me.

23
00:00:43.166 --> 00:00:45.466
This IOU is the evidence

24
00:00:45.666 --> 00:00:47.333
A done deal

25
00:00:47.333 --> 00:00:48.733
Pay debts

26
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.133
It is only natural

27
00:00:50.466 --> 00:00:51.766
Debt woman pays off

28
00:00:51.966 --> 00:00:53.366
It is only natural

29
00:00:53.366 --> 00:00:55.400
Do you admit it or not?

30
00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:56.900
Hahaha

31
00:00:57.066 --> 00:00:58.200
But it doesn't matter.

32
00:00:58.333 --> 00:01:01.700
Miss Li, I am not an unreasonable person.

33
00:01:01.866 --> 00:01:02.666
How about this?

34
00:01:03.333 --> 00:01:06.133
I'll give you two choices today.

35
00:01:06.166 --> 00:01:06.800
or

36
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.666
You help your father pay off the 50 million in one go.

37
00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.933
Or you can pay off your father's debts.

38
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.266
Until the 50 million is reached

39
00:01:17.333 --> 00:01:18.466
How is it?

40
00:01:18.666 --> 00:01:20.933
Hahahaha
