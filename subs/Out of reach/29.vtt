00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:03.600
I can definitely give him a hundred times more than you can give.

2
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:04.566
Hum Fei Er

3
00:00:04.566 --> 00:00:05.966
Yeah, the house here

4
00:00:05.966 --> 00:00:07.600
Pick any one you like

5
00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.266
Tell me I swiped your card

6
00:00:09.266 --> 00:00:10.166
Thank you, Brother Feng

7
00:00:10.166 --> 00:00:11.333
You are so nice to me

8
00:00:11.333 --> 00:00:13.200
Who did you just scold?

9
00:00:13.933 --> 00:00:17.200
I will scold whoever answers the call. Hello.

10
00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:18.066
You kid

11
00:00:18.066 --> 00:00:18.966
You are so awesome

12
00:00:19.266 --> 00:00:20.966
Why don't you come here and buy a house?

13
00:00:20.966 --> 00:00:23.200
Yes, if you want to choose, choose the good one.

14
00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.366
Don't even consider those below 30 million.

15
00:00:25.366 --> 00:00:27.333
It just so happens that I am in a class with Caiwei

16
00:00:27.466 --> 00:00:28.566
Give him a boost

17
00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.100
Lin Feng, please don't force it, okay?

18
00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:32.500
We are all high school classmates.

19
00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:33.566
Know everything

20
00:00:33.566 --> 00:00:36.666
You wore the same pair of worn-out shoes for three years in high school.

21
00:00:36.666 --> 00:00:38.266
Still asking for 30 million

22
00:00:38.266 --> 00:00:39.500
You really can brag.

23
00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.700
I heard there's a shabby building next door.

24
00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:44.333
Only 5,000 per square meter

25
00:00:44.333 --> 00:00:46.766
Especially suitable for your kind of residence

26
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:47.600
how

27
00:00:47.666 --> 00:00:50.100
You can't even afford a shabby tube-shaped building at 5,000 per square meter.

28
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.800
Then you blow

29
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.733
Go home and find some milk.

30
00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:55.066
Be honest

31
00:00:55.066 --> 00:00:56.866
If you can't afford it, don't force yourself

32
00:00:57.166 --> 00:01:00.266
Caiwei, don't bother with this kind of trash

33
00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:01.900
Aren't you trying to achieve results?

34
00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:05.666
Hey, I have reserved this 30 million villa first

35
00:01:06.066 --> 00:01:08.133
Really? Thank you, Brother Wang.

36
00:01:08.533 --> 00:01:09.766
Then you must remember

37
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.933
Please satisfy my request.

38
00:01:13.966 --> 00:01:14.933
Did you see it?

39
00:01:15.166 --> 00:01:17.866
This is called the hard power of men

40
00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.066
30 million is enough to call it strength?

41
00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.300
Dare to ask

42
00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.300
My 30 million is not strength

43
00:01:23.466 --> 00:01:24.933
Is it just a waste like you?

44
00:01:24.933 --> 00:01:26.200
I can't even afford a tube building

45
00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:27.333
Is that called strength?

46
00:01:27.333 --> 00:01:29.066
Who said I want to buy a small broken tube building?

47
00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.300
If I want to buy, I will buy this villa in the center

48
00:01:34.066 --> 00:01:35.333
Core Villa

49
00:01:35.333 --> 00:01:38.566
A loser like you wants to buy a core villa

50
00:01:39.133 --> 00:01:41.066
Hahaha I'm dying of laughter

51
00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.533
Lin Feng, are you kidding me?

52
00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:44.800
This central villa

53
00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:47.500
But the most prestigious 102 zodiac villa in the entire building

54
00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:48.900
There are 12 buildings in total

55
00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:50.666
Each building is worth hundreds of millions

56
00:01:50.733 --> 00:01:51.533
12 Chinese Zodiac Signs

57
00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.166
Yes, the 12 Chinese zodiac signs

58
00:01:53.166 --> 00:01:56.200
Moreover, I am not eligible to buy this villa.

59
00:01:56.366 --> 00:01:58.900
You also need to have extremely high assets to be able to buy a plane.

60
00:01:58.900 --> 00:01:59.766
What's your zodiac sign?

61
00:01:59.933 --> 00:02:01.366
They were born in 2000

62
00:02:01.366 --> 00:02:02.200
It's a baby dragon

63
00:02:02.266 --> 00:02:04.133
Do you like this villa?

64
00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:06.533
I like everything Feng Ge gave me.

65
00:02:06.533 --> 00:02:07.400
That's it.

66
00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.200
Manager Xia, could you please call your boss out?
