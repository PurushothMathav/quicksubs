00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:03.100
My money is also infinite.

2
00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:05.200
Oh, our Mr. Lin is so rich

3
00:00:05.266 --> 00:00:05.666
I don't know

4
00:00:05.666 --> 00:00:08.200
What birthday gift did you prepare for Goddess Caiwei today?

5
00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:08.500
ah

6
00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:09.300
oops

7
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.766
I really didn't prepare a gift for Caiwei today.

8
00:00:12.966 --> 00:00:13.900
I neglected it.

9
00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:15.466
I came here empty-handed.

10
00:00:15.766 --> 00:00:16.700
Hey Raymond Lam

11
00:00:16.766 --> 00:00:17.800
I'm not talking about you.

12
00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.000
We are all classmates

13
00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:21.500
You said you couldn't even afford a decent gift

14
00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.866
What kind of rich people's society is this?

15
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:24.733
Gao Shao

16
00:00:24.733 --> 00:00:26.700
Although Brother Lin Feng didn't prepare a gift for me

17
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:28.733
But you can't say that about him.

18
00:00:29.266 --> 00:00:30.066
Plucking vetch

19
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:32.300
Why

20
00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:35.666
This is the necklace I prepared for you.

21
00:00:35.866 --> 00:00:37.266
Didn't cost much

22
00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:39.533
Just over 100,000.

23
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.466
Hahaha, just be careful

24
00:00:41.533 --> 00:00:43.000
Caiwei, do you want me to help you put it on?

25
00:00:43.133 --> 00:00:46.366
This necklace should be much more expensive than the one on your neck.

26
00:00:46.366 --> 00:00:49.266
It's far inferior to the sea star on his neck.

27
00:00:49.866 --> 00:00:51.100
Sea Star

28
00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.366
I was wondering why this necklace looked so familiar.

29
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.300
So this is the R family auction

30
00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.166
The ocean star that sold for 3 million

31
00:00:57.166 --> 00:00:59.800
There are only two in the country.

32
00:01:00.266 --> 00:01:02.300
How many houses have you sold?

33
00:01:02.333 --> 00:01:03.666
You are too

34
00:01:05.133 --> 00:01:07.533
This necklace was bought for me by Brother Raymond Lam

35
00:01:07.533 --> 00:01:08.466
Not only this

36
00:01:08.533 --> 00:01:10.700
This dress was also bought by Brother Raymond Lam

37
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.933
This cost him more than 5 million.

38
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:13.800
Ha ha

39
00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:15.866
More than 5 million More than 5 million

40
00:01:15.966 --> 00:01:17.200
Hey, little money, little money

41
00:01:17.366 --> 00:01:18.733
Hahaha

42
00:01:21.333 --> 00:01:22.133
Be economical

43
00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:24.700
That's right

44
00:01:24.933 --> 00:01:26.200
Just 5 million

45
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.533
It's really small money.

46
00:01:28.366 --> 00:01:29.166
snort

47
00:01:29.866 --> 00:01:30.866
Hey, Pick Wei!

48
00:01:31.066 --> 00:01:32.966
I didn't prepare any gift for you today.

49
00:01:32.966 --> 00:01:35.366
Let’s put it this way, it wasn’t in your sales department last time.

50
00:01:35.566 --> 00:01:37.266
Have you bought a zodiac property?

51
00:01:37.266 --> 00:01:38.733
There are 50 left now

52
00:01:38.733 --> 00:01:40.466
Just pick one according to your zodiac sign.

53
00:01:40.466 --> 00:01:42.300
Hmm, what zodiac sign is this?
