00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:01.400
This is for you

2
00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:02.566
Don't despise

3
00:00:07.266 --> 00:00:08.333
This ring isn't cheap.

4
00:00:08.366 --> 00:00:10.066
This is my intention

5
00:00:10.133 --> 00:00:11.266
Please accept it.

6
00:00:11.266 --> 00:00:13.866
What a good trick to lay a long line to catch a big fish!

7
00:00:14.133 --> 00:00:16.400
This woman is much smarter than Li Feil

8
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.666
Are you trying to use the gold ring as bait to exchange for a gold house?

9
00:00:22.066 --> 00:00:25.166
Ah, I'm not used to receiving things from others.

10
00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:27.300
How about this?

11
00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:30.733
There is more than 10 million in this card.

12
00:00:30.733 --> 00:00:32.600
I bought this ring.

13
00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:33.666
You can't refuse

14
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:35.900
More

15
00:00:35.933 --> 00:00:37.966
Just think of it as you protecting me from the knife.

16
00:00:37.966 --> 00:00:39.733
The big fish is hooked

17
00:00:40.166 --> 00:00:41.066
Oh yeah

18
00:00:41.066 --> 00:00:43.700
What's the matter with you calling me here today?

19
00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:44.866
Tomorrow is my birthday

20
00:00:44.866 --> 00:00:46.733
I want to invite you to my birthday party

21
00:00:46.733 --> 00:00:49.133
There are several high school classmates you know.

22
00:00:49.166 --> 00:00:50.466
Oh three goddesses

23
00:00:50.566 --> 00:00:51.733
After so many years of graduation

24
00:00:51.766 --> 00:00:54.500
I haven't seen you invite me to your birthday party.

25
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.200
Why do I suddenly remember it now?

26
00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.500
Didn't I have your contact information in the past few years?

27
00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:00.766
Why is it now?

28
00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:03.866
Never mind. It's not important.

29
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.700
Remember to go to the hospital to bandage your wound. See you tomorrow.

30
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:08.966
Hey Raymond Lam

31
00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:10.266
I'll pick you up tomorrow

32
00:01:16.866 --> 00:01:20.466
Lin Feng, I will catch you sooner or later
