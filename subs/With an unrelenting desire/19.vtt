00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:02.266
This is a letter written to you by Aunt Lin

2
00:00:02.333 --> 00:00:04.566
He wants me to be his daughter-in-law

3
00:00:05.133 --> 00:00:06.300
Advance declaration

4
00:00:06.366 --> 00:00:08.866
I don't support arranged marriages

5
00:00:08.966 --> 00:00:09.666
But I

6
00:00:09.666 --> 00:00:12.700
Now he is really cornered by Wang Yu

7
00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:15.066
That's why I came to you for help

8
00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:18.500
You should recognize Lin as Auntie's self, right?

9
00:00:18.766 --> 00:00:21.300
Shishi, it turns out that you don't want me for a long time

10
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.500
Recognize me to another woman in the future

11
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:26.700
Miss Chen Lin

12
00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:29.666
As far as I know, you are Wang Yu's skill.

13
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.000
How could it be related to Lin Shi?

14
00:00:33.533 --> 00:00:36.366
Just a letter shouldn't hold back much

15
00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:38.766
Wang Yu killed my father

16
00:00:38.766 --> 00:00:40.166
Still trying to kill me

17
00:00:40.333 --> 00:00:42.466
Fortunately, my temporary aunt saved me

18
00:00:42.466 --> 00:00:44.000
And funded my education.

19
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.800
Like he funded you

20
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.300
You won't forget, will you?

21
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.800
Miss Chen Lin is so eloquent

22
00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.766
But I'm not interested in listening to your stories today

23
00:00:57.766 --> 00:00:59.066
I won't accompany you

24
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:00.500
Hu Ge

25
00:01:01.666 --> 00:01:03.700
Hey happy birthday

26
00:01:07.366 --> 00:01:08.566
How do you know that?

27
00:01:08.966 --> 00:01:11.133
Of course Aunt Linsa told me

28
00:01:11.133 --> 00:01:12.966
It's okay if you don't believe me.

29
00:01:13.266 --> 00:01:15.000
Today is your birthday

30
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.333
I'll live with you

31
00:01:16.333 --> 00:01:19.800
I haven't seen the boss celebrate his birthday in so many years

32
00:01:20.333 --> 00:01:22.900
What birthday am I an orphan waiting for?

33
00:01:23.566 --> 00:01:26.233
I'm not trying to find an excuse for him to accompany me

34
00:01:26.466 --> 00:01:28.433
I didn't catch what you said.

35
00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.966
You even know my birthday

36
00:01:33.733 --> 00:01:37.233
Looks like you've done your homework to cheat

37
00:01:37.366 --> 00:01:39.166
But unfortunately, Miss Chen Li

38
00:01:39.166 --> 00:01:41.366
I'm not in the mood to act with you today

39
00:01:41.366 --> 00:01:42.566
Please meet

40
00:01:44.166 --> 00:01:47.600
Stop, you stinky boy, your wings are hard, right?

41
00:01:48.366 --> 00:01:49.833
Pardon me?
