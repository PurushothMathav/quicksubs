00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:02.166
I didn't expect you to understand this

2
00:00:02.166 --> 00:00:05.400
Of course. I majored in computer science in college.

3
00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:06.400
Then please

4
00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.966
Help me find out the IP of this virus link.

5
00:00:08.966 --> 00:00:10.100
It's ok.

6
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.000
Who is he and who are you?

7
00:00:16.466 --> 00:00:19.633
Get your dirty hands off me, are you not qualified to order me?

8
00:00:20.066 --> 00:00:20.866
Jiang Yue

9
00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:22.500
Put Chen Shu down

10
00:00:24.666 --> 00:00:25.700
sit down

11
00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.966
Hmm, why is this scene so much like training a puppy?

12
00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:37.400
I went to him because I wanted to know

13
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.300
What happened to you that night?

14
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.700
Is this really that important?

15
00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:44.933
I know you hacked that girl's phone

16
00:00:44.933 --> 00:00:49.166
Your behavior makes me feel very insecure

17
00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:51.400
Let this Nan Nan go first

18
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:52.300
I'll go tell him.

19
00:00:53.766 --> 00:00:55.966
It's not that I don't understand human language

20
00:00:55.966 --> 00:00:56.833
I'm not deaf

21
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:00.433
Go ahead.

22
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.800
Eat this cake and I'll tell you

23
00:01:08.866 --> 00:01:09.700
OK

24
00:01:15.466 --> 00:01:16.266
And so forth.

25
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.833
What are you doing? I'll feed you

26
00:01:24.733 --> 00:01:25.666
How was it?

27
00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.266
I can't forget hatred for this warmth

28
00:01:35.266 --> 00:01:36.900
Guoguo is still slightly cold

29
00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.200
How can I laugh?
