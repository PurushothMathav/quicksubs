00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:06.600
Why did you bring me here?

2
00:00:10.333 --> 00:00:11.333
And you know what?

3
00:00:11.333 --> 00:00:12.866
I was raised an orphan.

4
00:00:13.566 --> 00:00:16.100
It's a temporary subsidy for my studies

5
00:00:16.166 --> 00:00:17.800
Sent me to study abroad

6
00:00:18.766 --> 00:00:20.633
I study so hard

7
00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.033
I just hope to become excellent one day

8
00:00:25.933 --> 00:00:27.633
Can get into his eyes

9
00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:32.266
Mr. Jiang's temporary aunt

10
00:00:32.333 --> 00:00:34.200
She knows you're a good boy

11
00:00:36.266 --> 00:00:38.033
But she still doesn't want me.

12
00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.100
I'm afraid I'll be left abroad alone

13
00:00:44.333 --> 00:00:45.233
Poetry.

14
00:00:46.866 --> 00:00:49.766
Why don't you want me anymore Shishi

15
00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:53.766
Mr. Jiang, you have the wrong person

16
00:00:53.766 --> 00:00:55.033
I'm not Lin Shi

17
00:00:55.133 --> 00:00:56.066
I think

18
00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:59.300
Aunt Lin Shi, he just wants you to study abroad

19
00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.033
Come back and inherit the Lin Group

20
00:01:04.333 --> 00:01:05.133
poetry

21
00:01:05.766 --> 00:01:07.266
I miss you.

22
00:01:07.733 --> 00:01:10.200
I still want to eat the egg fried rice you made for me

23
00:01:10.766 --> 00:01:12.833
But you're gone.

24
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.300
You bit me again!

25
00:01:18.533 --> 00:01:19.766
It's a dog

26
00:01:19.766 --> 00:01:22.533
If you bite me again, I will never make egg fried rice for you again.

27
00:01:22.533 --> 00:01:24.866
No you don't leave me try

28
00:01:25.066 --> 00:01:27.300
Please stay by my side, okay?

29
00:01:28.966 --> 00:01:32.266
Do you want to tell him I'm just getting wet?

30
00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:33.400
Jiang Yu

31
00:01:34.133 --> 00:01:36.833
In fact, he didn't die when he got wet

32
00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.166
The little kid is still as cute as he was when he was a kid

33
00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.666
The boss, Miss Chen Chenling, was rescued by Mr. Jiang

34
00:02:01.666 --> 00:02:02.500
What!

35
00:02:06.666 --> 00:02:07.900
So what?

36
00:02:08.533 --> 00:02:10.300
You go to someone and find some pictures

37
00:02:10.366 --> 00:02:12.433
Change Chen Ling's face

38
00:02:17.533 --> 00:02:20.033
Ah, educating the children.

39
00:02:20.666 --> 00:02:22.766
Paranoid since childhood

40
00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.633
Possessive.

41
00:02:25.566 --> 00:02:27.366
Seeing photos of Chen Ling

42
00:02:27.966 --> 00:02:30.166
Even if it's not true

43
00:02:30.866 --> 00:02:33.433
I'm afraid I won't tolerate it again in the future
