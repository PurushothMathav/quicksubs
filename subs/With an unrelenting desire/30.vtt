00:00:17.266 --> 00:00:19.000
Ah, go away

2
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.300
Mr. Jiang, how do you write it?

3
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.066
You think I'll be like that stupid man in the future

4
00:00:27.133 --> 00:00:28.266
I was framed by you obediently

5
00:00:29.866 --> 00:00:31.500
I have put you in the company.

6
00:00:31.666 --> 00:00:33.100
Evidence of a myth

7
00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:35.500
The evidence that you and I have imported into the upper echelons has been collected

8
00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:37.433
Get ready for oranges

9
00:00:37.566 --> 00:00:38.566
You move forward.

10
00:00:38.666 --> 00:00:39.800
Please forgive me

11
00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.200
I just don't want you and Chen Lin

12
00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:42.600
Is that wild girl together?

13
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.633
What right do you have to point fingers at me?

14
00:00:46.866 --> 00:00:48.733
Do you really have the heart to look at your own biological mother?

15
00:00:48.733 --> 00:00:50.100
Down and out?

16
00:00:51.533 --> 00:00:52.766
Pardon me?

17
00:00:52.766 --> 00:00:54.166
I'm mom

18
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.100
I knew Xiaoyu wouldn't be so cruel

19
00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:59.766
Give me the phone

20
00:01:00.266 --> 00:01:04.033
What I know give me your phone when you procrastinate

21
00:01:05.066 --> 00:01:06.366
If I don't give

22
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.666
I have a way

23
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.700
Hack into your phone and delete the video

24
00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.300
If you don't cooperate, I'll make your life worse than death

25
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.066
Why are you not surprised?

26
00:01:26.266 --> 00:01:29.266
Did you already know that I am your mother?

27
00:01:29.766 --> 00:01:32.400
I've seen you many times at the orphanage

28
00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.700
Every time you come to the corner to peek at me

29
00:01:34.933 --> 00:01:38.366
I overheard a conversation like this one one time.

30
00:01:39.766 --> 00:01:42.233
Did you put me in the orphanage on purpose?

31
00:01:42.333 --> 00:01:43.966
Just looking for an opportunity

32
00:01:43.966 --> 00:01:45.700
Let you raise your son for the rest of your life

33
00:01:46.166 --> 00:01:47.633
You know the temporary green hills

34
00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.800
Will raise an orphan to adulthood

35
00:01:50.566 --> 00:01:52.000
Heard it all

36
00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:53.600
I think about it

37
00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.000
And I have your rotten blood on me

38
00:01:56.066 --> 00:01:57.466
I feel sick

39
00:01:58.066 --> 00:02:01.466
Don't try to use the blood relationship, you don't deserve it

40
00:02:03.466 --> 00:02:06.700
I don't deserve it, does he deserve it?

41
00:02:07.066 --> 00:02:09.266
He can't even protect his own daughter

42
00:02:10.333 --> 00:02:12.366
Don't lift the corpse in front of me

43
00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.500
It will make you die miserably.

44
00:02:32.566 --> 00:02:33.400
Jiang Yu

45
00:02:34.466 --> 00:02:35.833
You've been drinking?

46
00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.866
Don't be like this, why is Jiang Yu so abnormal today?

47
00:02:46.866 --> 00:02:49.700
Is there something going on that I don't know about?
