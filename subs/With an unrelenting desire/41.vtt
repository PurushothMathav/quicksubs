00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:01.766
Who are you?

2
00:00:03.866 --> 00:00:05.566
Dare to come here to make trouble

3
00:00:06.066 --> 00:00:07.466
Wang Yu, are you stupid?

4
00:00:07.466 --> 00:00:09.066
Don't you know what we're here for?

5
00:00:09.066 --> 00:00:10.900
We are looking for you to collect debts.

6
00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:13.100
Hurry up and pay back the money your company owes my client

7
00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:16.166
What do you owe you?

8
00:00:16.333 --> 00:00:18.166
Your company is now an empty shell.

9
00:00:18.166 --> 00:00:20.266
In debt, don't you know?

10
00:00:20.266 --> 00:00:22.000
You're a shitty president

11
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.966
If you don't pay back the money, I want you to look good. The downloader is dirty.

12
00:00:27.966 --> 00:00:30.866
Let go of me! I don't know anything

13
00:00:30.866 --> 00:00:32.733
What are you doing?

14
00:00:32.733 --> 00:00:33.700
Sorry Mr. Wang

15
00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:34.933
When will the salary be sent to us?

16
00:00:34.933 --> 00:00:36.600
When will you call us again?

17
00:00:37.533 --> 00:00:38.333
you

18
00:00:39.166 --> 00:00:41.900
Mr. Wang, it seems that the rumors are true

19
00:00:41.966 --> 00:00:45.266
The Wang Group is now in deficit and debt

20
00:00:45.266 --> 00:00:47.666
It's a ticking time bomb.

21
00:00:47.666 --> 00:00:49.800
Wang Yu doesn't know anything

22
00:00:49.866 --> 00:00:51.500
So stupid

23
00:00:51.566 --> 00:00:54.000
No ability to run a company at all

24
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.833
Still smug here

25
00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:00.100
No I don't want

26
00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.500
Stop talking and shut up

27
00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.833
I know it's you, right?

28
00:01:07.933 --> 00:01:10.166
It's you who gave me the next set

29
00:01:13.466 --> 00:01:15.766
That's right, it's me.

30
00:01:17.533 --> 00:01:19.166
What if I give you the company?

31
00:01:19.166 --> 00:01:22.566
I've already moved all the company's money

32
00:01:22.566 --> 00:01:25.400
Leaving this debt-laden ruin

33
00:01:25.466 --> 00:01:28.200
I just gave you this trash.

34
00:01:29.466 --> 00:01:31.233
You bitch

35
00:01:32.966 --> 00:01:36.833
How about this?

36
00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.300
The taste of falling into the mud all at once

37
00:01:39.733 --> 00:01:41.400
It's hard to talk

38
00:01:43.266 --> 00:01:44.800
I'll kill you!

39
00:01:44.933 --> 00:01:46.066
Kill me!

40
00:01:46.066 --> 00:01:48.066
You think I'm still the right to be slaughtered by you

41
00:01:48.066 --> 00:01:48.966
benefit?

42
00:01:49.933 --> 00:01:52.400
You bereaved dog with nothing

43
00:01:52.766 --> 00:01:55.266
Let's think about how to pay off the debt

44
00:01:56.566 --> 00:02:00.766
Hahahahaha

45
00:02:02.333 --> 00:02:04.600
Mr. Wang remembers to pay back the money

46
00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:09.166
Come tomorrow night hahaha ah

47
00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.966
He admitted that the spring breeze looked smug

48
00:02:14.333 --> 00:02:16.466
Why is it so small?

49
00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:17.633
Lin's

50
00:02:18.333 --> 00:02:19.633
Is that you?

51
00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.000
Zhang Heng

52
00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.066
Put that bitch

53
00:02:30.066 --> 00:02:34.000
Bring me the little bitch born of hooves
