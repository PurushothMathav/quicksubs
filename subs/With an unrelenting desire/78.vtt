00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:03.666
Have a drink?

2
00:00:04.266 --> 00:00:06.200
Hmm, does the handsome guy have a pen?

3
00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:09.366
Turn right when you go out, there is a convenience store

4
00:00:09.366 --> 00:00:10.433
You can go there to play.

5
00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:12.700
Play hard to get with me

6
00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:15.033
Do you have paper?

7
00:00:20.933 --> 00:00:23.000
I can't believe you're not moving

8
00:00:23.866 --> 00:00:26.133
I'll see who you're calling then.

9
00:00:26.133 --> 00:00:29.833
Wife, he's calling me, what's the matter?

10
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.966
You said you are busy every day, so be busy.

11
00:00:36.566 --> 00:00:38.200
You are his wife

12
00:00:39.933 --> 00:00:41.066
What a pity!

13
00:00:41.166 --> 00:00:44.966
This handsome guy not only got married a year early, but also has a child

14
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:46.400
GuoGuo

15
00:00:46.966 --> 00:00:48.166
Mom?

16
00:00:52.466 --> 00:00:54.600
Who is Auntie?

17
00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.166
You actually call me auntie

18
00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.433
Honey, let's have another child

19
00:01:04.533 --> 00:01:06.333
Wife, do you want a boy?

20
00:01:06.333 --> 00:01:07.600
Or do you like girls?

21
00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.400
Honey, I really miss you so much.

22
00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.200
Teacher and student Guoguo are still there

23
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.400
Guoguo is not there

24
00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.300
Guoguo can't hear
