1
00:00:04.133 --> 00:00:06.166
You threw the pot directly at me

2
00:00:06.733 --> 00:00:08.700
Now the board wants me to step down

3
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:09.866
What to do now

4
00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:13.233
I warned you to stay away from Chen Lin

5
00:00:13.333 --> 00:00:14.633
You have to listen

6
00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:18.200
I can help you.

7
00:00:18.366 --> 00:00:20.833
But I want 10% of the temporary company shares

8
00:00:22.133 --> 00:00:23.966
Crazy about money

9
00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:27.833
I finally got that from you

10
00:00:28.666 --> 00:00:29.966
It's up to you.

11
00:00:30.333 --> 00:00:32.966
I said it's a big deal, the same ending

12
00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:38.700
But you have to make sure you can solve it.

13
00:00:39.266 --> 00:00:43.633
Don't worry, Chen Lin's little tricks still scare me

14
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.033
From today onwards

15
00:00:47.266 --> 00:00:48.833
Get out of this house

16
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.466
Now the temporary aunt's company is facing listing failure

17
00:00:53.466 --> 00:00:55.966
It will crash at the company in the future

18
00:00:56.066 --> 00:00:59.466
Who do you think you can rely on?

19
00:01:02.366 --> 00:01:03.300
Is the group president

20
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.666
He will be interviewed at the company gate in the future

21
00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:09.900
Guys, I'm giving 10% of the company to my wife

22
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.033
As a gift

23
00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.466
Our bond is unbreakable.

24
00:01:13.766 --> 00:01:15.166
He can prove my innocence

25
00:01:15.166 --> 00:01:17.766
Other things that don't exist

26
00:01:17.766 --> 00:01:20.166
It will never affect the listing of our company.

27
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.400
Please rest assured to inject capital

28
00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:23.200
Thanks.

29
00:01:23.533 --> 00:01:26.300
He would be willing to give you the shares

30
00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:30.666
Oops I told you

31
00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:34.766
I am more reliable than my relationship with future interests

32
00:01:36.566 --> 00:01:38.766
Is that right, Aunt Wang Yi?

33
00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:41.000
Then have you ever heard a saying

34
00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:42.500
Skynet is back

35
00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:44.300
Uncle

36
00:01:45.733 --> 00:01:47.266
What do you mean?

37
00:01:47.266 --> 00:01:48.366
It means nothing

38
00:01:48.366 --> 00:01:50.266
Just to remind you

39
00:01:50.366 --> 00:01:51.900
Too much walking at night

40
00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:53.266
Sooner or later

41
00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:54.633
you

42
00:02:00.266 --> 00:02:02.966
The video in the lady's white phone was successfully restored.

43
00:02:06.466 --> 00:02:07.466
Future uncle

44
00:02:07.933 --> 00:02:09.266
I want you to meet.
