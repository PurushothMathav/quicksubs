00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.466
No, I didn't.

2
00:00:02.566 --> 00:00:05.000
Please believe me. You're still lying to me

3
00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:06.766
You think I'm a fool

4
00:00:07.966 --> 00:00:09.466
I must exceed

5
00:00:09.466 --> 00:00:10.966
Wang Yuan is your stepmother

6
00:00:11.133 --> 00:00:13.133
You've hated your dad since he died

7
00:00:13.133 --> 00:00:14.366
So you used me for revenge?

8
00:00:14.366 --> 00:00:15.666
Who gave you the courage?

9
00:00:17.266 --> 00:00:18.233
Exactly.

10
00:00:18.933 --> 00:00:20.666
I want to use you

11
00:00:21.166 --> 00:00:23.700
Because Wang Yu always makes trouble for me.

12
00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.466
I can't resist

13
00:00:26.266 --> 00:00:28.266
I want to beg for your protection

14
00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:30.600
The whole house.

15
00:00:31.266 --> 00:00:33.900
Only you would stand up to protect me

16
00:00:38.366 --> 00:00:42.033
It was the first time I felt protected.

17
00:00:42.366 --> 00:00:44.833
If you think I lied to you

18
00:00:45.533 --> 00:00:47.266
Then you will kill me.

19
00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:50.800
I would rather die at your hands

20
00:00:51.733 --> 00:00:53.700
I don't want to be given up by you either.

21
00:00:54.566 --> 00:00:57.100
Ok don't cry

22
00:00:57.533 --> 00:00:58.700
Tell me about it

23
00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:10.100
Uncle don't

24
00:01:10.366 --> 00:01:12.300
What if my aunt comes back?

25
00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.733
Don't worry. He's out of town.

26
00:01:14.733 --> 00:01:16.000
Come back tomorrow

27
00:01:20.966 --> 00:01:23.566
I'd like to see Chen Lin, this little bitch hoof

28
00:01:23.566 --> 00:01:26.500
How big of a splash can you make at your neighbor's house?
