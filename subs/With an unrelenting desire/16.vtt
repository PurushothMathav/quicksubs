1
00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:02.466
Aunt Wang Yu's powerful means

2
00:00:02.466 --> 00:00:04.166
Uncle can't compare to you

3
00:00:05.266 --> 00:00:06.566
Wang Rihui compatriot Yu Ji

4
00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:15.000
In the future, you will not think that this family

5
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.900
It's up to you

6
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.200
Kobayashi has flattered

7
00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:27.600
Face the enemy

8
00:00:27.766 --> 00:00:30.433
One must be preserved

9
00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:34.066
You saw what happened to your uncle

10
00:00:34.066 --> 00:00:35.766
But don't allow your uncle

11
00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.233
Of course, bad things happen.

12
00:00:39.366 --> 00:00:41.866
Nature pays for itself.

13
00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.800
Future uncle is the first example

14
00:00:45.066 --> 00:00:46.900
Here's a second example.

15
00:00:47.366 --> 00:00:48.666
Who could it be?

16
00:00:49.866 --> 00:00:53.166
What will Lawyer Wang's uncle do in the future?

17
00:00:53.166 --> 00:00:55.066
Preliminary conviction for intentional wounding

18
00:00:55.066 --> 00:00:57.666
The follow-up situation also depends on the victim's injury

19
00:00:57.666 --> 00:00:59.666
But you can't escape jail

20
00:00:59.766 --> 00:01:03.866
It's all the fruit of Yingde, this scum in the future

21
00:01:03.866 --> 00:01:07.800
You wait for mom to send the bad guys in one by one

22
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.166
Lawyer Wang, I see, you can go to work.

23
00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.600
What did you just imply?

24
00:01:17.966 --> 00:01:19.700
Believe it or not, I will send you to prison.

25
00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.166
With Gangnam Fujiwara?

26
00:01:21.966 --> 00:01:25.300
Of course I believe that Aunt Wang Yu has this ability

27
00:01:26.066 --> 00:01:28.266
You just stabbed yourself

28
00:01:28.666 --> 00:01:31.400
You can take all the bad things you've done

29
00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.100
Push it all to the same

30
00:01:33.266 --> 00:01:35.666
Pick yourself clean

31
00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.233
What nonsense are you talking about?

32
00:01:39.566 --> 00:01:41.800
You're out of your mind again

33
00:01:45.666 --> 00:01:47.400
To think people don't know

34
00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.266
Unless you don't

35
00:01:49.866 --> 00:01:54.300
All the bad things you've done are known

36
00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:56.866
You know, so what?

37
00:01:56.866 --> 00:01:59.500
I'm about to become the new director of the company

38
00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.466
You've done so much

39
00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.066
Still no way to shake me

40
00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.566
And you, you bereaved soldier

41
00:02:08.066 --> 00:02:10.366
Why don't you get out of here?

42
00:02:21.566 --> 00:02:23.366
Hey, I'll go crazy in the future.

43
00:02:23.366 --> 00:02:25.066
Sent to a mental hospital

44
00:02:25.066 --> 00:02:27.666
And I saw Jiang Yu

45
00:02:29.066 --> 00:02:29.866
Jiang Yu

46
00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:33.566
Jiang Yu

47
00:02:33.566 --> 00:02:36.100
Me and the student who funded it in the future

48
00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:37.266
He is the kindest

49
00:02:37.266 --> 00:02:40.400
Coming back at this time should not help the future, right?
