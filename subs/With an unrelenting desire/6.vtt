00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:01.166
You make a price

2
00:00:01.166 --> 00:00:03.100
As long as you can fix the video inside.

3
00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:04.800
I'll pay any amount.

4
00:00:04.866 --> 00:00:06.266
Leave the phone with me first

5
00:00:06.266 --> 00:00:08.500
If there is a door, please notify you.

6
00:00:12.066 --> 00:00:14.700
This video was exchanged by Guoguo with his life

7
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.466
If I can't fix it, how can I be worthy of him?

8
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.800
Did you take that little bitch's phone?

9
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:32.900
Take it for repair

10
00:00:33.466 --> 00:00:34.866
What phone?

11
00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:36.866
You're still pretending to be stupid

12
00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:40.766
I used to go looking for someone

13
00:00:40.766 --> 00:00:42.600
Ask the owner of the repair shop to pass

14
00:00:42.766 --> 00:00:44.633
He said you took it to fix it.

15
00:00:48.766 --> 00:00:51.500
I did find this phone under the sofa

16
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.833
I just want to fix it for my own use

17
00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:56.433
Or forget it.

18
00:00:56.966 --> 00:00:58.366
I have got the phone.

19
00:00:58.366 --> 00:01:00.566
I want the kid to use it. My minister knows.

20
00:01:02.366 --> 00:01:04.800
Did you see this little bitch crying?

21
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.033
Chu poor

22
00:01:07.566 --> 00:01:08.600
I'm so tired.

23
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.366
You don't think a man will speak for you

24
00:01:16.366 --> 00:01:17.666
I can't afford more

25
00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.400
Since you like kneeling so much

26
00:01:21.666 --> 00:01:23.600
Then kneel until I'm satisfied

27
00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:27.900
You stare at Chen Lin here

28
00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:29.466
Without my permission

29
00:01:29.566 --> 00:01:30.600
He can't come in.

30
00:01:30.933 --> 00:01:32.166
Yes, ma'am.

31
00:01:37.866 --> 00:01:40.766
I'm fine uncle, I'm used to kneeling

32
00:01:40.866 --> 00:01:42.400
Go find your aunt

33
00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.666
Otherwise he will be angry again later.

34
00:01:47.133 --> 00:01:48.300
Talk to you don't move

35
00:01:48.966 --> 00:01:52.266
I'm not cold, don't get my uncle's clothes dirty
