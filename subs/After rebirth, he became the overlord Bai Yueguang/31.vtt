00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:01.366
Hey, Dawn

2
00:00:01.566 --> 00:00:03.700
When did your brother find you a sister-in-law?

3
00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:06.366
The most valuable golden tortoise-in-law in his hand is gone like this

4
00:00:06.366 --> 00:00:07.800
He was a maid.

5
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.466
The climbing point is called

6
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.166
Brother, you are confused

7
00:00:11.166 --> 00:00:12.866
Favoured by this fox

8
00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.266
No, you have to hand over a maid as your sister-in-law

9
00:00:16.266 --> 00:00:17.066
Ha ha.

10
00:00:17.533 --> 00:00:18.933
How could you possibly admit him?

11
00:00:18.933 --> 00:00:21.333
Vivid hotel with brilliant construction by the boss

12
00:00:21.333 --> 00:00:22.600
Not talking about colleagues

13
00:00:22.666 --> 00:00:24.433
You just need to pick something up for the first time.

14
00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:25.900
Let's go

15
00:00:27.066 --> 00:00:28.300
Give them money

16
00:00:30.733 --> 00:00:32.433
Lots of food.

17
00:00:32.466 --> 00:00:34.500
I'm afraid you haven't eaten it yet.

18
00:00:36.066 --> 00:00:38.066
Not only have I seen it, I can also do it

19
00:00:38.066 --> 00:00:40.033
This sushi looks so advanced

20
00:00:40.066 --> 00:00:42.466
It's just rice with vinegar and kneaded into rice balls

21
00:00:42.466 --> 00:00:44.300
Just put peanut fish fillets on top

22
00:00:45.266 --> 00:00:47.666
It's you ladies

23
00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.200
Without the money from my parents

24
00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:51.700
Can you support yourself?

25
00:00:51.766 --> 00:00:53.266
So what?

26
00:00:53.533 --> 00:00:55.300
This group of us?

27
00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:56.566
Born with

28
00:00:57.733 --> 00:00:59.500
Unlike you pauper

29
00:00:59.666 --> 00:01:02.766
Can it be saved by making money manually?
