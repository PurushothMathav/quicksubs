00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:02.300
When did Mr. Yan have a fiancÃ©e?

2
00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:04.900
His fiancee is so beautiful and so outstanding

3
00:00:04.933 --> 00:00:06.700
It must be some rich daughter

4
00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:08.066
Rich daughter

5
00:00:08.533 --> 00:00:09.733
How could you think

6
00:00:09.733 --> 00:00:11.266
I'm just something you won't even look at when you open your eyes

7
00:00:11.266 --> 00:00:12.300
Cleaner

8
00:00:12.666 --> 00:00:13.733
Work a little faster!

9
00:00:13.733 --> 00:00:16.966
If you don't eliminate it, it will deduct your salary. Okay, manager.

10
00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:20.600
Hey boss, hey, I know, okay, okay, I'll be right there.

11
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.500
Yo nephew

12
00:00:23.766 --> 00:00:25.600
When do you have a fiancÃ©e?

13
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.366
There is such a big thing, it is not wise uncle

14
00:00:28.366 --> 00:00:29.466
Can't tell

15
00:00:29.466 --> 00:00:30.700
Who is this guy?

16
00:00:30.966 --> 00:00:32.466
Why does it look so familiar?

17
00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:35.833
Hey, what are you doing today?

18
00:00:36.266 --> 00:00:37.466
Get out of here!

19
00:00:37.466 --> 00:00:38.900
Do you know how expensive my shoes are?

20
00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:40.866
I told you, I can't afford to pay for a year's salary if it gets dirty.

21
00:00:40.866 --> 00:00:43.033
What dog is angry sorry

22
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.800
That is Vice President Yan Jihai

23
00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.166
It sounds like the president's uncle

24
00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:06.333
Actually.

25
00:01:06.333 --> 00:01:09.266
He is the illegitimate son of the old man outside

26
00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:15.800
A tree owner actually solicited approval from our president

27
00:01:16.466 --> 00:01:18.200
Rich people are not bad

28
00:01:18.366 --> 00:01:21.166
Then rich people also have good character

29
00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.733
Our president is good

30
00:01:23.733 --> 00:01:26.133
For people like us at the bottom?

31
00:01:26.133 --> 00:01:28.100
They are all very kind

32
00:01:28.366 --> 00:01:30.566
How can it be like his strictly prohibited industry?

33
00:01:30.566 --> 00:01:33.033
Nostrils look down on people

34
00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.900
Don't take it to heart, it's him
