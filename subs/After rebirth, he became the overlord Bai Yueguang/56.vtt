00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.200
You crippled my son and tried to run

2
00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:03.000
No way.

3
00:00:03.866 --> 00:00:05.233
You are responsible for my son

4
00:00:05.733 --> 00:00:07.100
What am I responsible for?

5
00:00:07.166 --> 00:00:08.733
That's his own bad luck

6
00:00:08.733 --> 00:00:10.700
You flew my legs.

7
00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:14.066
Did you hear that you are responsible for his rebirth?

8
00:00:15.366 --> 00:00:16.300
let go

9
00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:18.633
I will compensate you with a sum of money.

10
00:00:18.866 --> 00:00:22.000
Compensation for ruining my son's life

11
00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:24.366
How much are you going to compensate us?

12
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.866
I told you we don't want money

13
00:00:29.066 --> 00:00:31.900
No money, what do you want?

14
00:00:32.666 --> 00:00:35.166
I want you to get a marriage license with my son right away

15
00:00:35.333 --> 00:00:38.700
Impossible, I'm Miss Rock Group

16
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.766
How could I possibly marry a cripple?

17
00:00:40.766 --> 00:00:43.700
How could I be fooled when this got out?

18
00:00:48.866 --> 00:00:50.100
I'll tell you what.

19
00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.000
If you don't marry me today

20
00:00:53.333 --> 00:00:54.866
I will kill you

21
00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.500
If you have the ability, you will die

22
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.600
I don't have your verification in my hands.

23
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.266
If you don't marry me

24
00:01:02.266 --> 00:01:04.033
I'll post you.

25
00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.000
Let the upper class take a good look at you

26
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.300
How coquettish people are

27
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.200
I'll see how you get through it in the future
