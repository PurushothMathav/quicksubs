1
00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:01.466
Make money with your own hands

2
00:00:01.466 --> 00:00:03.066
Feed yourself happy and fulfilled

3
00:00:03.066 --> 00:00:04.600
You can't feel it at all

4
00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:05.700
You will only rely on home

5
00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:06.866
It's a man.

6
00:00:06.866 --> 00:00:07.766
pretentious

7
00:00:07.766 --> 00:00:08.500
Long straight irritating

8
00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:11.866
Whoops, you're a maid who really puts yourself up

9
00:00:12.066 --> 00:00:14.866
Look at this poverty, it has become fulfilling

10
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:18.800
What else do you want?

11
00:00:21.366 --> 00:00:23.500
You must be able to cook

12
00:00:24.133 --> 00:00:25.900
You are such a good cook.

13
00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:27.400
I will definitely do laundry

14
00:00:30.066 --> 00:00:30.966
For women like you

15
00:00:30.966 --> 00:00:32.866
I don't deserve to be at this party at all

16
00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:34.600
Go back and do your laundry.

17
00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.033
Don't be here.

18
00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.266
Dawn can't get wet here

19
00:00:39.266 --> 00:00:40.100
Really cool

20
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.400
Sure enough, she is a daughter who does not touch the sun and spring water

21
00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.300
The lady takes the champagne lady

22
00:00:47.733 --> 00:00:48.633
You know

23
00:00:49.333 --> 00:00:51.400
What to do is the most patient

24
00:00:52.666 --> 00:00:55.766
What is it, soy sauce?

25
00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.300
Dawn, I will avenge you

26
00:01:00.466 --> 00:01:01.900
All kindergarten children know

27
00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:03.500
You can't dry some food for me to eat

28
00:01:03.666 --> 00:01:05.166
Why did Zaizai buy bells?

29
00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.666
Okay, are we going to help?

30
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:09.966
Just beautiful.
