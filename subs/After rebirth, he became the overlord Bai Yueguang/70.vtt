00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:07.500
Hello, do you want to know about cleaning service?

2
00:00:10.266 --> 00:00:11.166
Long time no see.

3
00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:15.466
You actually pretended to be a customer and lied to me

4
00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.600
Early morning light, can you stop pestering me?

5
00:00:17.766 --> 00:00:18.566
I will pretend

6
00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:23.366
As long as you sign this contract

7
00:00:23.366 --> 00:00:24.900
It's the adults of your company

8
00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:26.500
Don't have to

9
00:00:27.133 --> 00:00:28.700
The company is not short of you

10
00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:31.566
You can leave now.

11
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:33.400
But I'd like to see it

12
00:00:33.666 --> 00:00:35.866
Who dares to risk offending my project

13
00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:37.100
Collaborate with the company

14
00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:38.500
What do you want?

15
00:00:39.933 --> 00:00:42.066
Destroyed a newly disabled small company

16
00:00:42.266 --> 00:00:43.200
Not single

17
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.466
Why are you doing this to me?

18
00:00:45.366 --> 00:00:46.466
Don't you forget.

19
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.100
You lied to me first

20
00:00:48.266 --> 00:00:52.166
Any revenge I want is yours, don't be silent

21
00:00:56.066 --> 00:00:56.966
Okay.

22
00:00:57.533 --> 00:00:59.000
As long as you help me do one thing

23
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.566
How long will Mr. Yan wait?

24
00:01:10.666 --> 00:01:12.466
I said I'd be the maid

25
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.500
I haven't said I want to do this yet

26
00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:16.900
Food is good

27
00:01:17.366 --> 00:01:18.933
Then prepare a few more dishes

28
00:01:18.933 --> 00:01:19.866
And this big one.

29
00:01:21.566 --> 00:01:23.766
Our blind date came to the house for dinner

30
00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:25.966
Are you going to give him a like?
