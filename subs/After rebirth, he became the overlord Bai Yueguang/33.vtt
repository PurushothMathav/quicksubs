00:00:06.266 --> 00:00:07.366
Hey Xiaorong

2
00:00:08.133 --> 00:00:09.866
Your sister is sick

3
00:00:09.866 --> 00:00:11.166
You go back and take care of her first

4
00:00:11.166 --> 00:00:12.300
Leave it to me here

5
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:13.100
Ah!

6
00:00:13.866 --> 00:00:16.533
Oh, thank you, sister, then I'll go first.

7
00:00:16.533 --> 00:00:18.566
Okay, go, go, go

8
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:22.666
Excuse me.

9
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.600
These cake creams are a hassle to clean up

10
00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:27.400
Here's some hard work for you.

11
00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:30.166
Here you go.

12
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:35.866
I've been cleaning for so long

13
00:00:36.333 --> 00:00:39.566
No one has ever cared so much about my work

14
00:00:40.533 --> 00:00:44.833
Miss, you are different from those rich people

15
00:00:45.866 --> 00:00:47.466
We're all human.

16
00:00:47.466 --> 00:00:49.166
I dare not distinguish between high and low

17
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:55.500
Let me tell you something.

18
00:00:58.300 --> 00:00:59.633
Sister's sister

19
00:01:00.766 --> 00:01:02.633
His own sister?

20
00:01:02.933 --> 00:01:07.866
It was forced to death by the Yan family's apartment

21
00:01:07.866 --> 00:01:11.200
After my sister was fired

22
00:01:11.333 --> 00:01:13.066
full broadcast

23
00:01:14.166 --> 00:01:17.066
Everyone is talking about him

24
00:01:18.766 --> 00:01:22.566
It means that it was rubbed off by an enemy

25
00:01:24.966 --> 00:01:27.966
It's okay, Mr. Yan is not bad to me

26
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Yeah, it's fine.

27
00:01:29.366 --> 00:01:32.466
Mr. Yan's posture is very full, you can follow

28
00:01:32.766 --> 00:01:35.766
You will definitely be implicated if you follow him.

29
00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:36.966
Pardon me?

30
00:01:36.966 --> 00:01:39.933
I was just sweeping the hallway

31
00:01:39.933 --> 00:01:41.666
I heard his uncle

32
00:01:41.666 --> 00:01:44.633
It's like I'm on the phone with a real-world friend

33
00:01:44.866 --> 00:01:45.666
Say

34
00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.300
OK, it's all arranged.

35
00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:51.100
Just wait for Mr. Yan to go out

36
00:01:53.666 --> 00:01:54.466
Hey.
