1
00:00:00.566 --> 00:00:02.266
Doctor Fu, don't be angry.

2
00:00:02.266 --> 00:00:04.300
In fact, Miss Xia is a good person

3
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:05.666
Good guy

4
00:00:06.733 --> 00:00:09.066
Slap someone on the first meeting

5
00:00:09.133 --> 00:00:10.633
Is there such a good person?

6
00:00:11.266 --> 00:00:13.266
Miss Xia was involved in a car accident as a child

7
00:00:13.266 --> 00:00:14.300
Blindness

8
00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:15.933
He often comes to our hospital to see glasses

9
00:00:15.933 --> 00:00:17.166
So I know him.

10
00:00:17.166 --> 00:00:18.666
Although he was born into wealth

11
00:00:18.666 --> 00:00:20.000
But he likes to do good.

12
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.966
Often help some poor people

13
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.933
Xiao Zhang, you are still too young

14
00:00:26.933 --> 00:00:28.866
Many upper-class ladies do charity

15
00:00:29.066 --> 00:00:30.700
It's not because they're kind.

16
00:00:30.866 --> 00:00:32.300
But because of doing

17
00:00:32.366 --> 00:00:34.400
It can attract more social attention

18
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.033
Enhance one's reputation

19
00:00:36.866 --> 00:00:41.100
In my opinion, that Miss Xia is such a person

20
00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:45.633
or

21
00:00:46.466 --> 00:00:48.333
Organize a dinner another day

22
00:00:48.333 --> 00:00:49.600
Let him apologize to you.

23
00:00:50.166 --> 00:00:53.600
No, not even the most basic respect for people

24
00:00:53.666 --> 00:00:55.700
I don't want to eat with people like that.

25
00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.066
Did you hear?

26
00:00:58.066 --> 00:00:59.433
Miss Xia saved someone

27
00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:00.966
What's up?

28
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.466
A vase just fell from upstairs

29
00:01:03.466 --> 00:01:05.900
Fortunately, Miss Xia stood up despite the danger

30
00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:07.700
Otherwise, it will kill people

31
00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.000
The man saved by Miss Xia

32
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.666
My wife is doing chemotherapy in our hospital

33
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.533
Miss Xia also gave them a sum of money

34
00:01:12.533 --> 00:01:13.900
Let them heal with peace of mind

35
00:01:15.166 --> 00:01:18.033
How about I say that Sister Xiaoxiao is not bad, right?

36
00:01:22.366 --> 00:01:23.766
Then why did he hit me?

37
00:01:24.133 --> 00:01:25.900
I provoked him. I provoked him.

38
00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:28.633
This Miss Xia

39
00:01:28.766 --> 00:01:30.700
It's really puzzling.
