00:00:00.533 --> 00:00:03.566
What do you mean Natsume doesn't have Natsuya?

2
00:00:07.566 --> 00:00:09.300
I suspect you took a taxi that day, Butler Chen

3
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:10.200
Saw by him

4
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.633
Since you are not blind

5
00:00:12.266 --> 00:00:14.633
Why is he pretending like nothing happened?

6
00:00:14.733 --> 00:00:15.533
Late summer.

7
00:00:15.533 --> 00:00:17.700
Far more scheming than we imagined

8
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:19.666
He seemed calm

9
00:00:19.766 --> 00:00:21.800
Must be secretly transferring property

10
00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.466
Look, I'm going to divorce you

11
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:24.900
What can be done?

12
00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.000
Don't worry.

13
00:00:26.533 --> 00:00:28.966
Xia Meng doesn't know what's wrong with her brain

14
00:00:28.966 --> 00:00:32.866
Right now, he is on the rooftop preparing to jump off the building.

15
00:00:35.866 --> 00:00:37.500
Miss Xia, come down quickly

16
00:00:37.733 --> 00:00:39.366
If I fall

17
00:00:39.466 --> 00:00:41.166
What should I do if there is no reincarnation of time?

18
00:00:41.166 --> 00:00:42.700
Isn't Lao Huang really dead?

19
00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:45.700
Is it really worth it to be a ball for two strangers?

20
00:00:45.866 --> 00:00:48.600
Xia Meng wishes you but do good deeds

21
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.166
Mo Wen Qiancheng

22
00:00:50.466 --> 00:00:51.800
But good deeds

23
00:00:52.066 --> 00:00:53.366
Mo Wen Qiancheng

24
00:00:54.066 --> 00:00:56.200
The old fairy made my eyes light up again

25
00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.100
Gave me the ability to reincarnate time and space

26
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.800
I should use this ability to help others

27
00:01:07.166 --> 00:01:08.166
Miss Xiang
