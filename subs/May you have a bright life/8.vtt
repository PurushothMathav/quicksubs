00:00:02.566 --> 00:00:05.300
Look at the stars in the sky

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:07.900
So beautiful, hahaha.

3
00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:10.500
Butler Chen, do you still recognize me?

4
00:00:10.933 --> 00:00:12.866
You are Wu Dalang

5
00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:17.000
They are Pan Jinlian and Ximen Qing

6
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.600
Haha wife

7
00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:18.466
Butler Chen is crazy

8
00:00:18.466 --> 00:00:19.633
Don't listen to him

9
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.366
I know you go out first

10
00:00:22.466 --> 00:00:24.233
I want to be alone with Butler Chen for a while

11
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:36.100
Hahahahahaha

12
00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.966
Chen Guanqiang, I am a dream

13
00:00:39.366 --> 00:00:41.900
Dream? I don't know

14
00:00:43.533 --> 00:00:44.966
At the age of 12

15
00:00:44.966 --> 00:00:46.766
Our family has already left

16
00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:48.900
My parents left me

17
00:00:48.966 --> 00:00:50.966
You watched me grow up little by little

18
00:00:50.966 --> 00:00:52.466
I was admitted to Dazed University

19
00:00:53.066 --> 00:00:55.266
It was you who sent me to school not far away

20
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.833
Even my wedding to Li Yangchen

21
00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:00.200
It's all what do you do when you're busy?

22
00:01:00.566 --> 00:01:02.666
How old are you still crying?

23
00:01:02.666 --> 00:01:04.366
Hahahaha

24
00:01:04.366 --> 00:01:05.433
Butler Chen

25
00:01:06.366 --> 00:01:08.600
Although you are not related to me by blood

26
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:09.933
But in my heart

27
00:01:09.933 --> 00:01:11.600
I have long regarded you as a father

28
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.800
Hahahaha

29
00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.466
Don't worry, I'm just selling off the marriage minister.

30
00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:18.900
I will definitely cure your disease

31
00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.666
Wait until your illness is cured haha

32
00:01:21.666 --> 00:01:23.433
Daughter will give you filial piety

33
00:01:24.766 --> 00:01:25.833
Stop crying

34
00:01:26.933 --> 00:01:29.266
Crying is a good child
