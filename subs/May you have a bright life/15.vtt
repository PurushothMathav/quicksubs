00:00:00.666 --> 00:00:02.666
You mean Xia Meng?

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.966
Maybe not.

3
00:00:06.733 --> 00:00:09.466
I saw him save lives today.

4
00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:10.400
Obviously

5
00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.900
This is not something that a blind person can achieve

6
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:15.866
If there is no summer dream

7
00:00:16.766 --> 00:00:18.933
What we did to Chen Wanxia that day

8
00:00:18.933 --> 00:00:20.300
He probably saw it.

9
00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.800
No way I accompanied him to the hospital so many times

10
00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:25.100
There are doctor's examination reports

11
00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:27.033
Miserable he can't hide from me

12
00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.000
that

13
00:00:28.666 --> 00:00:30.700
What if he just got better recently?

14
00:00:31.333 --> 00:00:33.166
If blindness is good

15
00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:34.566
And he didn't tell us.

16
00:00:34.566 --> 00:00:36.966
It means he's already on guard against us.

17
00:00:37.533 --> 00:00:40.000
Maybe they are already secretly transferring property

18
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:40.800
No way.

19
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.200
We need to quickly confirm whether he is blind or not

20
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.000
If you are really blind

21
00:00:45.066 --> 00:00:46.866
Let's maintain the status quo

22
00:00:47.366 --> 00:00:50.466
Wait until I get the 10 billion order from Pangu Group.

23
00:00:50.566 --> 00:00:52.966
You have the ability to kick him out of the company

24
00:00:52.966 --> 00:00:54.633
What if he doesn't?

25
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.366
Not down

26
00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.300
It means that they already know about us.

27
00:01:00.466 --> 00:01:03.200
Then just kill those

28
00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.000
Then disguised as an accident

29
00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:06.600
It will be up to me

30
00:01:07.133 --> 00:01:09.433
To inherit the entire inn

31
00:01:12.533 --> 00:01:14.700
I want to know the end of the shrimp dream

32
00:01:14.933 --> 00:01:16.233
I have a way

33
00:01:20.466 --> 00:01:22.233
Then it all depends on rice

34
00:01:33.733 --> 00:01:35.766
Here's your coffee, Ma'am.
