00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:01.650
Please tell me?

2
00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:03.160
say what?

3
00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:07.670
say what?

4
00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:10.190
What to say? What to say? What to say? What to say?

5
00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:12.710
What to say? What to say? What to say? What to say? What to say? What to say? What to say? What to say? What to say? What to say?

6
00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:14.590
What to say? What to say?

7
00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:16.570
What to say? What to say? What to say? What to say? What to say? What to say? What to say?

8
00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:18.310
What to say? What to say?

9
00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:20.750
say what?

10
00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:29.890
say what?

11
00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:31.550
What to say? What to say? What to say? What to say? What to say? What to say?

12
00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.570
What to say? What to say? What to say? What to say? What to say? What to say? What to say? What to say? What to say? What to say? What to say? What to say? What to say? What to say? What to say? What to say? What to say? ? What to say? What to say? What to say

13
00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:32.910
Of course you are happy

14
00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.730
If this is the character you choose, grandma

15
00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:36.290
Don't say you were promised

16
00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:37.790
Even if it is a fool's choice

17
00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:39.070
Then for our Su family

18
00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:40.860
I will also organize

19
00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.200
Is there still one person who is willing to wait for me?

20
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:43.520
It was you

21
00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.120
Fang Dao did this kind of thing before

22
00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.840
Itâ€™s all the matriarch and the heroine who sells you

23
00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:48.040
I suspect he is very good

24
00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:50.520
What a shame, why are you doing this?

25
00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:51.920
Come in two days

26
00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.380
There are some people

27
00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:54.820
Then we donâ€™t know why the other party is like this

28
00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:56.860
Actually, it's not bad. They're all married.

29
00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:58.620
Anyway, the 13th

30
00:00:58.620 --> 00:00:59.520
No matter what

31
00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.280
The suspect must get married
