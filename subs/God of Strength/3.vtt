00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:03.410
If you don't reply from me, your life will be the same.

2
00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:06.760
Could it be that you would die when you see me and still not miss you?

3
00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.030
What are you talking about?

4
00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:12.420
So what if they all responded? They are useless.

5
00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:16.090
Do you think you are promoting diplomatic relations with the military?

6
00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:21.780
I'm right! We've never given you food and you've long since starved to death on the roadside.

7
00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:24.120
How dare you miss me?

8
00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.080
Do you figure it out?

9
00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.000
Is this me?

10
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.710
What? What?

11
00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:31.620
What? What? What?

12
00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:33.220
What? What? What? What? What?

13
00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:36.950
What? What? What?

14
00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:37.030
What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What?

15
00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:40.920
Are you still not stupid now that you are dead?

16
00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:46.790
How come you are so serious about this?

17
00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:48.800
But I still miss it

18
00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:52.710
What are you doing? What are you doing here?

19
00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.960
I saw it as a gift in Yigui.

20
00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:07.870
Your body is married to him

21
00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:12.860
Everyone is here to read the old man’s book

22
00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:15.650
Such a local virus

23
00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:23.560
Don't say you were a fool before

24
00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.820
You're not stupid now if you're not here

25
00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:27.200
How about that

26
00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:31.370
You are just a person who makes a living by renting a pack of dogs.

27
00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:38.060
And my truly beautiful Xu family is on the market

28
00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.160
Don't tell me that I'm involved in this.

29
00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:46.390
I have the right to accompany you in front of you like this

30
00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:48.510
Your woman is right for you

31
00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.180
Can you take me again

32
00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:56.970
No job to kill

33
00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:00.320
This guy is hiding money

34
00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:02.850
Then just talk about Jiangxia Home Furnishing

35
00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:08.350
I just wrote "smart"

36
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
This doesn’t make it obvious that this luggage

37
00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:17.240
It was fine just now

38
00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:25.900
There are two ways to get him to come over: go there
