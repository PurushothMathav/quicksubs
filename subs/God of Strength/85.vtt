00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.060
What did you say? It's nothing?

2
00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:13.320
You say, wait a moment,

3
00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.140
Just eat your rice and talk less,

4
00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:18.940
This is a tight line for you to give me, you know?

5
00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:23.360
You, Dali, also eat it, but you don’t usually interact with the funeral family.

6
00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.740
I must have done something good today,

7
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.220
Just like dog selection, if you hadn't just signed up for the book, the group would always pass by,

8
00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:31.700
Where do I come from?

9
00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.870
You said you are the same, you must be spending my money on this material,

10
00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.200
You said it's my account, why can't you come?

11
00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:41.780
That's what my mom is like.

12
00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:43.280
Don't worry

13
00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:45.560
I stay in this home

14
00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:46.540
This is you

15
00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:49.380
What do people say, think, and see?

16
00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.090
I don't care at all about wearing clothes and the details

17
00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:04.030
It's not the coat that talks about you

18
00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.970
Why did you bring your family's lungs?

19
00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:08.730
He is at your home

20
00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:10.430
Will you be mixed and not high enough?

21
00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.670
He also said that my son-in-law’s belt was

22
00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.600
This is what my cousin said

23
00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.800
Why didn't I wear him as my cousin?

24
00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.940
One feels that the lungs of the legs have been

25
00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:24.160
The comments are enough to make me angry

26
00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:26.160
Good luck with music, Su Jiaqi

27
00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:27.220
I marked it too

28
00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:29.520
With a white and white fly

29
00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.020
Not happy enough

30
00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.280
My cousin really has a problem

31
00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:35.780
Just enough for two people, a bunch is good

32
00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:37.580
This big white guy

33
00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.180
If you don’t want those dog eyes of yours

34
00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.140
I don't mind if you hang him up
