00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.310
Mom, what's going on with you?

2
00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:06.170
This hot thing, you say, is what the person who was destined to die got from when he first left.

3
00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.070
It's still a one-shot deal.

4
00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:10.730
One of the few things you can profit from if you become a monk.

5
00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:12.870
Let's take a good look,

6
00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:21.360
What's on that woman's order now?

7
00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:24.340
Tell me, what's on top of this?

8
00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:27.370
What are you talking about?

9
00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:30.330
What is the development date?

10
00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:31.880
Will it be possible?

11
00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:33.490
Why is this kind of accounting place like this?

12
00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.110
Bad diplomacy

13
00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:37.800
Anyway, not a single piece came out.

14
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.000
It's our father who is bad

15
00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:40.560
There is someone

16
00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:43.500
Can you get a man who wants to harm us and send him home?

17
00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:44.590
What do you mean?

18
00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:45.770
what does it mean

19
00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.010
A ghost-crying kind of place

20
00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:50.570
Those ghosts crying are outsiders possible

21
00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:52.050
There are also ghosts crying

22
00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.470
Mingzhou Prefecture City

23
00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:54.650
How much you learn is easy to repeat

24
00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:55.890
Not that much speed

25
00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.430
To trim and remove

26
00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:59.050
Just make a big move

27
00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:01.250
Why do you think that class is to make men

28
00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.120
Except maybe zero message

29
00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:06.100
What are the other benefits of this set?

30
00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:07.180
A big shot like him

31
00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:09.260
There should be no reason not to do this.

32
00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:11.530
you do not say

33
00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:13.550
As long as we can't drag loose cash

34
00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:17.420
Responsible for setting up the land of Pingzhen for a good future

35
00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:18.780
The income from this land

36
00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.120
100% of the stones will fall on our Su Prize

37
00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:24.270
Itâ€™s really not easy to do the math nowadays.

38
00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:25.250
Our Su Prize

39
00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:26.630
Add money so easily

40
00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.690
Just enough of this casual cash

41
00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.220
Isn't this a good thing? A good thing

42
00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:34.720
its a good thing
