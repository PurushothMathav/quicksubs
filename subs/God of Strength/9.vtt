00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:04.290
Makes sense. Sister Shulan is so brave.

2
00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:06.610
What can Sister Shuluan do when she sees a prostitute?

3
00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:09.730
Could it be that he is the calligrapher's second son?

4
00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:13.460
It's called yes, but it really doesn't look like it. How about that many people?

5
00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.340
Put your grandma on the fire and roast it.

6
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:19.180
I don't want it. Brother, you don’t want it.

7
00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:22.980
The reason why Sister Luan has such courage must be this boy.

8
00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:26.480
Not so brave. That’s what I had in mind.

9
00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.970
She is an old woman who can't figure things out and doesn't get it right.

10
00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:33.580
If you win, please give it to grandma soon. Sorry.

11
00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:38.760
I didn't do anything. Why do you apologize? Please explain.

12
00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.080
Sorry grandma

13
00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:44.140
I can't tell you that you won't win by mistake.

14
00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:46.440
For the past three years, it has been our Song family

15
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:48.640
Be our Song family Lingliang

16
00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.080
Also plays Mr. Wen

17
00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:51.800
Hezi didn't take good care of him

18
00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:55.980
Does it make sense to lie to you? Three things are the same

19
00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.660
Adopt a dog to meet the owner

20
00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:59.880
I also know that there are great companions who are not like him.

21
00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:05.620
There are three things that make the same old lady

22
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.340
This is a good day

23
00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:08.700
Why get angry

24
00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.200
In fact, your husband’s mood

25
00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.500
I can understand too

26
00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.420
It’s just that my consciousness cannot accept my own feelings.

27
00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:18.410
There are so many kind people at the table

28
00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:20.230
I even sympathize with this expense

29
00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.910
What do you mean at that table?

30
00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.040
Although this feeling is understandable

31
00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.080
But after all, this is the sales pitch of the old lady.

32
00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:30.740
This is not the earth of Huazhong University of Science and Technology

33
00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:34.380
Since it’s the second lady’s fault, it’s not as good as

34
00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.260
Just take the position of Marketing Director of Sushi Group

35
00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.400
Leave it to others

36
00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:42.370
Since the price of Huading

37
00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.450
Ben Hong, who they gathered in Su Shi at a price, was chopped to death.

38
00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.230
The position also makes no sense

39
00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:48.970
Even more suppressed than ten thousand people

40
00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:51.380
This market is not something that the director is prepared to compete with.

41
00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:53.140
It was Hua Ding who was in this environment

42
00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.800
Because I only have four hours a day in exchange for this night court

43
00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:00.370
Why are you saying so lightly?

44
00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:01.870
That's it, let's go
