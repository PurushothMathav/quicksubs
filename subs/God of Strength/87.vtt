00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.140
Pay money, is it?

2
00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:04.160
Are you leaving this virtual hometown?

3
00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.560
This is the dead man's house,

4
00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:09.430
I paid for it, not just one,

5
00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:11.010
What are you doing?

6
00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:12.570
Are you both of us?

7
00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:15.300
But they can't help it, let's practice it,

8
00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:17.390
How could he die?

9
00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:21.020
Seeing that you have to stay away, find someone else,

10
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:27.510
Go to Beicheng Group and take down Guihu Protective Slope,

11
00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.530
Was it said that Weixin became a special zone?

12
00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.580
I heard that there are underground signs, and Beicheng Group’s practice has always been to put primary schools first.

13
00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:41.110
Hua Weixin can definitely win their cooperation. Sister Bai

14
00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:42.530
My butt is getting bigger

15
00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:48.460
It's not right to be a great person

16
00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.790
What a child

17
00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:52.130
We are in a good place now

18
00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:53.590
I just took over their leadership

19
00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:54.970
He even called someone over himself

20
00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:03.490
I'm on top now, right? Don't listen to what he said about driving.

21
00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:05.850
I'll open the car for you then.

22
00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.470
You lead your heart

23
00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:10.470
Whoever comes in goes where

24
00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:11.430
That door is abandoned

25
00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.070
That's not the heart

26
00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.650
Shall we open the car for you?

27
00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:19.720
This leader is

28
00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.520
He will give you a new military commander

29
00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.700
In fact, he can

30
00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.020
You're not here. In fact, you did it.

31
00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.700
Don't be like this. What happened next to Mr. Dong Du?

32
00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.230
Want to tell it to me

33
00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.440
Add some business

34
00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:35.700
This is just the new one I've been assigned to now

35
00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.900
The most complex affairs

36
00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:39.570
Do you think it’s management?

37
00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.120
But I thought I was managing myself

38
00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:45.930
You thought it was in him who is righteous

39
00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:46.730
You thought it was in him who is righteous
