00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:02.110
I will help you with this matter.

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:11.320
Good, good, good.

3
00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:13.220
Thanks! Guys work hard.

4
00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:15.910
I hate that one of the chief managers has a mobile phone,

5
00:00:16.329 --> 00:00:18.480
Just having something is enough.

6
00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.990
The old lady Jiuwen came to drink tea.

7
00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:23.420
This matter is believed in Maojie,

8
00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:25.540
The blue sky and jade leaves at the top.

9
00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:27.180
Value 74 years old.

10
00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:28.950
What a good thing.

11
00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:31.790
This thing is like a piece of ice floating in the sun and green flying,

12
00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:35.930
So it is called. Although its quality is not as good as top-knot Diwang Green.

13
00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:37.750
But such a precise statement.

14
00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:40.410
There are also a few very valuable people

15
00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:41.210
3 million

16
00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:45.430
The organization is really thoughtful, right?

17
00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:48.070
It's a gift from the old lady's army.

18
00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:56.300
Set Dango for every few plates

19
00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:58.740
Unfortunately, if you do well, you can bid

20
00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:00.900
But everything can be related to itself

21
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.500
Zhou traps the old lady and serves Dong Ye

22
00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:04.720
Hands bigger than boys

23
00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:07.860
It's so hard to do the root set.

24
00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.260
Secret, your family is the Northern Calendar King

25
00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:14.760
Then come up with a better gift. The result is of course

26
00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.200
We are all looking forward to it

27
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.300
I saw all your family members

28
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:20.480
Why are they connected? I'm sorry.

29
00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:21.820
those of us

30
00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:24.530
Of course I can deliver better hungry fish

31
00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.060
something like this

32
00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:30.890
Also suitable for the table

33
00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.390
I said what are you doing?

34
00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:39.450
That's five minutes

35
00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.270
Send the hungry fish

36
00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:45.580
Don't open it again. Scroll down.

37
00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:46.780
I've been careful

38
00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.760
I can handle this, thank you

39
00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:51.130
If I do it, something will happen in the end

40
00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:53.540
Just thank you for what you said yesterday.

41
00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:59.040
Come on, what you said to your hand won't hurt. Let's go in and take a look.

42
00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:14.060
The emperor's premonition is as clear as ten electric sutras
