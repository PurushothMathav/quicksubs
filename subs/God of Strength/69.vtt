1
00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:08.060
Go forward, you are finally here,

2
00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:11.910
The truth comes from the superficial and vulgar falsehood, just like the way forward,

3
00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:13.810
The table is a warm bad look.

4
00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:15.670
You vulgar old lady, you are so annoying.

5
00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:17.930
I also gave our chef noodles,

6
00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:19.790
There is also the Su family, which never leaves home.

7
00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:25.380
But you are sure that everyone in the Su family is here.

8
00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.520
Yes, what's the matter?

9
00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:31.340
Then why, I didn't see Miss Su.

10
00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:32.680
Miss Su.

11
00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.650
Far away, I almost saw it before walking away.

12
00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:36.850
Go ahead.

13
00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:41.840
Here, just say that the person who pretended to be Miss Su is not in the original team.

14
00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:44.460
Last time my ex-boyfriend looked away

15
00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:45.660
Why do you, a liar, drink?

16
00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:48.560
Where does a liar start?

17
00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.460
What we want to cooperate with is Su Huainu’s emotions

18
00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:53.110
Not some cat or dog

19
00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:56.490
Can you meet me casually? Mo Congwai is the former president

20
00:00:58.690 --> 00:00:59.550
Mr. Pregnant Girl, come on again

21
00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:01.850
And he is now responsible for the mistake

22
00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.650
It has nothing to do with our cooperation this time.

23
00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:05.870
Only the former president

24
00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:08.320
It's totally fine if you want it in advance or always.

25
00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:10.010
Pregnant with a baby girl

26
00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:11.940
He made such a claim

27
00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:14.140
You have to stop us from repairing our home first.

28
00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:15.020
Build an army

29
00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.880
Still here

30
00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:17.060
At home

31
00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:19.190
There is no one higher than him

32
00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.930
Excuse me

33
00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:22.110
Sent to Taiwan Army

34
00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.290
Is this the case today?

35
00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:24.910
You encourage your family

36
00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:25.790
Who is not in these

37
00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:27.420
But Su Huaidi's conditions

38
00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:30.180
You have to make money and get somewhere

39
00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:33.850
This one is like we either don't sign or we sign

40
00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:35.780
It must be Su Huaidi’s condition
