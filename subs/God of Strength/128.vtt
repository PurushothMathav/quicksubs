00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:05.570
Go up and tell us all the whole story.

2
00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:08.730
Grandma, did you make a mistake?

3
00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:10.570
I'm so happy for you

4
00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:12.730
Unforgettable

5
00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:15.140
Why are you so cheap to him?

6
00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.820
What does this matter have to do with Xu Jie?

7
00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:24.270
No, I know Yunzhou's Nuo Shi in my heart. If you live up to your promise, money can always save you.

8
00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.850
Go up and have a chat over the rice bowl

9
00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:30.970
This pretending good thing can fall on your head, but

10
00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:31.890
What is Zhuo

11
00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:35.220
But this matter is Ye Zhuo's outstanding achievement.

12
00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:38.980
Ye Zhuo is your other one.

13
00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:41.500
The rules of ice cloth are

14
00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.500
He got rid of his connections in Beijing

15
00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:45.400
I found the largest high-level executive in Beijing.

16
00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:48.110
Can you make money and go higher?

17
00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:50.850
I'll learn from your rules

18
00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:52.960
It should just be a coincidence in the body.

19
00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.880
After all, the former president

20
00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.600
Except for the general position

21
00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:01.950
I am actually the person with the highest status in Beicheng Group

22
00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:04.900
After history determines the truth

23
00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:06.120
That rule of yours

24
00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:08.020
It all matters

25
00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.680
What does scary mean?

26
00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.680
This is because it’s your regular father-in-law’s bar

27
00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:15.430
What does chasing have to do with you?

28
00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:18.730
He has been married for so many years in Baishi, Sujiang

29
00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:21.110
Even if it doesn’t bring any benefit at all

30
00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:24.580
It's too hot. Please invite us.

31
00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:25.920
How can this be the case?

32
00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.370
I listened to your table all night

33
00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:29.870
You are a pig, Sister Su

34
00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.800
My pig night, my pig night

35
00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:33.760
My pig night, my pig night

36
00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:34.760
I also listened to it all night

37
00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.390
Don't tell me, Mason Group is really in trouble

38
00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:38.790
It’s a wave card introduced carefully

39
00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.160
Even if it is your Lord’s empty mind

40
00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.300
Compared to the future of our losers

41
00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:44.720
What does it matter?

42
00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.260
You mainly have to go
