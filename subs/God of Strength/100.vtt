00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.900
I don't know either, I just know

2
00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:03.600
I don't want her to die.

3
00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:05.420
Even if I let her take me with me.

4
00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:06.940
I thought you didn’t want to say tomorrow.

5
00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:09.730
I don't want to open it myself.

6
00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:12.710
You! So I really wanted to ask if you should show me your head first.

7
00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:13.610
I've poured out your water.

8
00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:17.210
There are things that can make you happy.

9
00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:18.570
Your mother called me, what did I give you?

10
00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:20.490
No, if you make me feel better.

11
00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.000
The size is bigger, you are a relative,

12
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
You think so.

13
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.580
You just want to live life with her like this.

14
00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:30.420
No, it’s not impossible. I can make money myself,

15
00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:31.740
She can protect the artificial.

16
00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.040
She protects the boy from Jianghu Changqian

17
00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:37.300
Protect you more

18
00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:38.950
Jianghu marry me

19
00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:40.860
We can't lie to you here

20
00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.840
Oops, my mouthpiece said you are one of the best.

21
00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:45.960
Let’s not forget to tell you

22
00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.340
I still recognize Yuan Zhuan by that name

23
00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:48.400
You can stop in the background

24
00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:50.640
Maybe you are the one who saw me at home and said

25
00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:52.670
His name is Qiu

26
00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:53.990
Come and meet Mr. Quan

27
00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:56.990
Why, it’s too late for you to meet me?

28
00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:58.190
Thanks to Yuan Zhuan

29
00:00:58.190 --> 00:00:59.530
It’s great to see you so much

30
00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.970
It's not the end of the attack.

31
00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:02.490
Our horses are so big

32
00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:03.990
Never heard of this heroine

33
00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:05.700
I may be of the same sex

34
00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:06.960
What did you say carefully?

35
00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:12.830
Kill Kasiban you later

36
00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:14.730
It may be a rights issue with this card.

37
00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:15.810
I'll take care of it

38
00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:17.210
You'll leave later

39
00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:27.150
you for a while

40
00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:28.830
That's good for a while

41
00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.980
The killer of Kasiban was arrested

42
00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:38.440
I'll talk about it later
