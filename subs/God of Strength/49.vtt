00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:03.700
I know you are a real retail investor,

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.920
But why do you have to say something bright?

3
00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.360
It was already very difficult for a few people in the family to accommodate themselves. You said,

4
00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:10.540
Are things getting out of hand?

5
00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:12.570
It is obviously the end of the old lady's army,

6
00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.140
You believe me, the bigger this thing is, the more childish it is.

7
00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.000
It is your duty only to turn everyone into a regular soldier.

8
00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:21.620
She doesn't order so clean up the noble appearance of your face.

9
00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:23.520
But why are you who you are?

10
00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:25.200
Now everyone they already know,

11
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.160
Only an old man can analyze your future affairs.

12
00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:29.880
You can't be rushed in this kind of loose goods, you are not a female companion of high energy.

13
00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:32.320
Come on, they made a mistake.

14
00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.380
Then why have you ever had a problem with Bai Si in your life?

15
00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:37.760
I just mean what I mean

16
00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:38.640
Are you still designing?

17
00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:42.870
I am my design

18
00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:48.920
Where should I go so late?

19
00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:50.680
I think twice about going back

20
00:00:53.340 --> 00:01:07.950
I’ll compare the details of the legend tomorrow.

21
00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.050
Have a drink

22
00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:10.970
But the rice will be cooked

23
00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:12.670
Ever since you suddenly got married

24
00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:14.370
It's not like it's too much.

25
00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:15.950
I can’t even walk here from the company’s house

26
00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:17.920
The general manager came out with me when he had time.

27
00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.240
Don't you want to cry?

28
00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.460
Let's think about it as a family

29
00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:23.780
We don’t have much else on the North Shelf

30
00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:24.780
Very difficult but the most
