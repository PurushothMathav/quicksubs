I, loser Zhongran, just followed and was well hidden behind the whole group,

7
00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:27.120
There are dozens of discussions every year,

8
00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:29.140
And they continue to discuss cleaning up,

9
00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:33.730

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:51.100
This little bit of separation

20
00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:52.280
Be expressive

21
00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:53.660
Only benefits can be sent to

22
00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:55.040

26
00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:02.580
I don't have the ability to drive a freewheeling car, so I don't need it.

Public opposition

28
00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:09.050
It's up to you to be happy first

29
00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:14.130
Do you want to plant it?

30
00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:17.370
How ordinary were you when I was born in those days?

31
00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.700
