00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:02.320
Me and my friend of sin?

2
00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:08.080
My dear, you are very perceptive.

3
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:09.700
Since our home is full of police,

4
00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:12.180
Is that a teacher’s child?

5
00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.740
How is it possible to occupy a position within a kilogram?

6
00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:17.040
But he is him, he makes his own decision,

7
00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:19.260
Let me mention one person, he is a self-made writer,

8
00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:21.720
OMG, OMG,

9
00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:24.320
It's not my fault, please send me a message.

10
00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.180
No matter what you do, I must treat it as the truth.

11
00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.080
Why do you kid talk like this?

12
00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:31.800
Were you aware of this decision at that time?

13
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.360
In fact, you are kind of

14
00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:34.500
Everyone will win over you

15
00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:38.320
I really like him, I don't, I just

16
00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.100
It's good for you to have a responsibility towards him

17
00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:42.810
Let Lai take charge

18
00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:44.290
from today

19
00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.400
Those two points of red are not cancelled.

20
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:51.380
He can't

21
00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:53.580
Our family is a bit like this

22
00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:55.420
What about the days of Fenghongguo?

23
00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:56.780
environment sense income

24
00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:59.840
Not enough for this price

25
00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:06.180
What are you doing? You’re not enough, right?

26
00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.340
I remember

27
00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:08.040
You don't have enough

28
00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.360
Get a car dance order

29
00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.600
The words are right

30
00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.020
when to wait for you

31
00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:14.800
Can get an order as big as forgiveness

32
00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:16.580
Come back up again

33
00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.020
why are you laughing

34
00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:24.650
It's you who was killed by my boss

35
00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.540
What level are you recruiting for?

36
00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:29.320
What's wrong with this river cave in Suyuan now?

37
00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:30.860
What is the most important thing you mentioned?
