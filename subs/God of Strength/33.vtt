00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:02.700
What does this flower give?

2
00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:06.460
I don’t know. Why is the relationship not so good?

3
00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.260
Are you asking me to come out of my house?

4
00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:12.100
Anyway, this flower was shipped from Bao’s house.

5
00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:15.080
You have more than thirty-three in total, so I will give you thirty-three with me.

6
00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:17.940
We have to look at this picture as it does not bring luck to anyone.

7
00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:21.200
This was brought by express transportation. You can see that this is just for school.

8
00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:23.790
Only rich people can have more and more luck.

9
00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:24.950
some people here

10
00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:28.840
Thank you for talking to me

11
00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:31.350
Give us a house and a car and

12
00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.650
These are the most popular roses abroad and

13
00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:37.730
Auntie said you have liked roses since you were a child

14
00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:41.900
Why do I give myself roses when I never allow you to find them?

15
00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:44.320
You gave yourself a relationship

16
00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.080
If you don’t tell me, I’ll give you a rose

17
00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:47.640
Did you get that rose for you?
