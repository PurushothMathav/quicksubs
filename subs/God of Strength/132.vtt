00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.530
At this point, don’t get angry.

2
00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:04.420
Grandma, I didn't read Qi.

3
00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.490
This is also Su Xia's current situation. You said it is indeed not the price.

4
00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:10.650
You have also found a future for Su Xia. so,

5
00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.050
I must agree, since you know,

6
00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:16.390
Why are you still saying this? I took care of him for three years,

7
00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:18.410
More than a thousand are one word.

8
00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:20.510
These three methods will teach dogs to have feelings, right?

9
00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:23.170
Am I not a human being? I have no heart anymore.

10
00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.030
His legs haven't healed yet, so how can he live alone?

11
00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:29.580
Don't worry, I'm going away from home, it's so comforting.

12
00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.260
No one will take care of me better than me,

13
00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:32.240
How is my brother?

14
00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:33.380
I let him go

15
00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:34.900
Not letting you go

16
00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:36.280
Your other family members

17
00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.140
How can you get past him?

18
00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:39.640
Can I work for another company?

19
00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:40.640
You make money

20
00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.390
It doesn’t matter if you work less

21
00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:44.580
It doesn't matter if you only eat one blue head a day

22
00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:46.900
If he doesn’t have enough to eat tomorrow, he’ll be fat.

23
00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:48.720
I'll just give it to you

24
00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:53.900
It’s simply the amount of wind

25
00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:55.560
I actually disagree

26
00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:57.500
If you dare to make such a decision

27
00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.120
we belong to family

28
00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.540
There is no such thing as you, who keeps himself locked up without smiling.

29
00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:02.840
You don’t have to admit it

30
00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:04.379
Then I'll give you the joint

31
00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:07.440
Some people remember that after you talked about grandma Su’s family

32
00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.770
This is what my grandfather learned all his life.

33
00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.330
I'll go back and pack for New Year's Eve

34
00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:15.350
I won’t let you and the Su family know how to do it.

35
00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:17.830
Learn to disagree

36
00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:21.090
As long as I don’t agree with you leaving Grandma Su’s family

37
00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:21.830
why is that

38
00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:23.610
You often say I have no ability

39
00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.290
Just because I can be separated into whichever one

40
00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.320
Of course most of them look

41
00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:27.680
Today we wrote this book

42
00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:29.840
It won't have any impact on the Su family
