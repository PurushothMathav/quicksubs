00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.240
All made to drink.

2
00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:09.110
But no, you were almost there, right? Change it up.

3
00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.850
Do I have to discuss with you what I want to buy?

4
00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:20.940
I don't want to,

5
00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:22.660
And I still don’t want to divorce you,

6
00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:24.580
Wouldn't it be because,

7
00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:26.080
It's also the worst time to meet each other.

8
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:27.780
Show me some respect if you can help me.

9
00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:30.160
Respect is given to people.

10
00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:32.290
Instead of giving you this,

11
00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:35.810
You will only rely on others, as long as you don't buy a dog.

12
00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.310
Others, what do you think you do? Do you still need to be lucky? prepare you

13
00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:52.080
Is this going out, eldest daughter?

14
00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:53.930
You call the woman

15
00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:54.930
You yourself are not affected

16
00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.650
It’s only natural that someone else will recognize it

17
00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:58.950
My eyes are shining

18
00:00:58.950 --> 00:00:59.810
He must realize it

19
00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:01.900
Without recognition

20
00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:04.239
Unawareness

21
00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:05.860
If you say that, I'll hit you

22
00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:07.120
I don’t dare to bully your uncle

23
00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:09.540
I took him to the next woman's apology

24
00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:11.940
You just want to hit you

25
00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:12.860
It’s not that I don’t recognize it

26
00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:13.880
Why don't you go?

27
00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:14.780
This is the only one I will bring with me

28
00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:15.700
I'm not saying
