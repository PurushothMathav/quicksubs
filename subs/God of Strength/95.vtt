00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.430
Try it, why?

2
00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:04.310
Do you think Alliance Guard’s job is good?

3
00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:16.640
It starts tomorrow! Try it, try it, try it, try it, try it, try it

4
00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:22.310
Try it, try it, try it, try it, try it, try it, try it, try it, try it, try it, try it, try it, try it, try it.

5
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:25.700
Try, try, try, try, try, try, try, try, try, try, try, try, try, try, try, try, try, try, try, don’t bother the waiter

6
00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:27.640
Hello sir

7
00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:30.300
Is there anything I can do to help you at this table?

8
00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:32.560
Credit it to my account

9
00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:34.820
Let me take you up first

10
00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.080
Please bring it

11
00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:44.060
Sister Bai, go home

12
00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:49.470
Let's go home, Sister Bai, look at it

13
00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:54.560
Then we won’t disturb my house

14
00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:55.220
Dad, I'm sorry.

15
00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:56.160
Can you tell me something?

16
00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:56.920
Continued on the outside of your body

17
00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:57.820
You tell her

18
00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:58.740
I see

19
00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:00.080
I really know it was wrong. What did you do?

20
00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:02.850
Are you sure you haven't taken over yet? There's no rush.

21
00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:08.990
Did she give her that look?

22
00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.140
You smell coffee, coffee?

23
00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:14.340
This photo is so cute

24
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:17.780
It's just tea, it doesn't count as a date with me, do you understand?

25
00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:19.890
Will you dare to assume that you know each other?

26
00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.530
If I know you, why do you turn it off?

27
00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:25.070
Why does he want to help you? I will help him find a way.

28
00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:27.150
Even if the road is closed

29
00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:29.490
I see your relationship with Yuan Tan

30
00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:30.110
no problem

31
00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:34.400
You are not a father if you are so absorbed in Zhaofeng.

32
00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:39.400
It’s not the one who collects flowers, it’s not what he did

33
00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:43.730
Which one do you choose for overtaking?

34
00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:45.190
You did well today

35
00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:49.240
We also ran and got tired so easily, auntie

36
00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:52.180
You guys go back and rest quickly. Don’t walk too tired.

37
00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:58.410
We are so happy together today

38
00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:02.480
Those are good facts

39
00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:05.070
By the way, you can catch tomorrow

40
00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.670
What else but to come back?

41
00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.550
You might as well go pick her up soon.
