00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.500
Right, how can you deal with me with your hands?

2
00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:05.680
As for this person, you still don’t want him.

3
00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.330
That's right, but how do you say this?

4
00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:13.190
As for the link, this is my sniper.

5
00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:15.170
What about this girl?

6
00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:17.070
Today I need to be stronger to support my family,

7
00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:19.730
This disability makes it difficult to eat.

8
00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:24.230
Church, see if you have any good work there.

9
00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:28.050
Find a home of your own for this one,

10
00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:30.050
Uncle, thank you. Hello,

11
00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:31.170
But my job,

12
00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:32.549
I can't live without it

13
00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.360
What to say

14
00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:37.100
Is it always good for me to earn a few, sister?

15
00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:38.780
Zhao Branch Officer Rigao

16
00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:41.920
Can my wife find him a job among the Seven Clans?

17
00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:43.640
Even if it's reasonable

18
00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:45.980
let me think about it

19
00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:51.270
You said we are healthy?

20
00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:52.530
At least they have to take a major.

21
00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:56.050
You probably don't have any academic qualifications.

22
00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:57.950
You just make a small broken wheel

23
00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:01.750
Then you can’t even do the Ganbao Festival.

24
00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:03.710
The guy who was tired a while ago

25
00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:04.970
Retire soon

26
00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:06.770
If your brother doesn't mind

27
00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:08.390
Come and have a look at our company

28
00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:09.390
Nothing wrong with that

29
00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:10.870
It's behind us

30
00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:13.670
Privately, what do you call a watchdog?
