00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:04.080
Come in with us again, and you'll pay a dollar for a while,

2
00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:05.940
Don't be too sad.

3
00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:07.620
As long as you go out to see Su Xiao,

4
00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.560
Our Su Xiao will also get better and better,

5
00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:12.020
When the time comes, grandma will give you a big chicken pigeon,

6
00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:14.560
You are so sure, Su Xiao at the place where you are attending the meeting,

7
00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:17.440
Su Xiao is coming more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more.

8
00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:29.920
More and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more. More and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more. More and more, more and more

9
00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:31.080
Not allowed

10
00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:31.940
Let's search

11
00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:33.080
Chenghui Yanfang

12
00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:34.560
That's lovely

13
00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:36.860
Even better than trying again

14
00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.180
Better State Affairs also said

15
00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:41.320
We can still be ourselves

16
00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.320
dependent on others

17
00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.620
Not this

18
00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.580
What is the right path?

19
00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:48.220
Then let me search home and so on.

20
00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:49.540
That's the right way

21
00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:51.470
Not what you mean

22
00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:53.070
You mean we search your home?

23
00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.450
Ask your disabled husband

24
00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:55.490
Can still cross

25
00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:00.280
The more people there are, the more they all start to make noise to me.

26
00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:02.870
What's so good about your character's husband?

27
00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:05.730
That makes you miss me so much than you promised

28
00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:09.080
Remember to be prepared for calamity when speaking

29
00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:10.740
Are you willing to speak?

30
00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.000
Fuck better now

31
00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:13.080
But you are wrong

32
00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:16.050
As long as you give me a courtesy phone

33
00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:18.230
It would definitely be better if I could take a vacation

34
00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.280
Hope it's really the same

35
00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.180
Because of the fight, I hope

36
00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.140
You really have a reason to be so awesome

37
00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.260
let them know

38
00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.110
They got it wrong and are trying to rob me. Let me do it.
