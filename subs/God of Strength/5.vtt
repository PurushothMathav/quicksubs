00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:10.190
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry,

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:12.010
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry,

Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry,

8
00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:40.620
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.320

sorry sorry

11
00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.220
you seem to make people

12
00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:46.000
I doubt it

13
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.640
I thought I was so suspicious

14
00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.120
I saw you look like this now

15
00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:57.910
How worried I am

16
00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:07.330
Sister, if you don’t buckle half the car, you’ll feel tired if you don’t buckle it.

17
00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:11.900
I won’t say anything anymore

18
00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:14.530
Grandma and the others see you like this everywhere

19
00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:16.850
I don’t dare to say that I mean it

20
00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:18.790
Sister Su Jia can do it even after two years.

21
00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:20.830
The real pressure on me is even greater

22
00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:23.030
Half a sister is passing on

23
00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:25.790
Except for your temper, your behavior will remain the same.

24
00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:28.070
I'll have to find a fool to choose again.

25
00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:34.250
I'm an ordinary girl too

26
00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:36.080
I clean others

27
00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:37.540
able to hint

28
00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:39.020
No not in the sun

29
00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:43.340
Someone is waiting for you and me because of their wind

30
00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.340
Only one person can experience it because of me

31
00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.260
I don't want you to die, you think about it again

32
00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:56.400
And it's good for me to meet
