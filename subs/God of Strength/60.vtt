00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:05.100
Lian Feizao, it is a red iron chain for searching for fire dragons,

2
00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:07.280
Come on, what are we going to do?

3
00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:12.400
Can we come up with appropriate and easy cards to deal with it.

4
00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:15.830
This kind of grown-up is very fluent even if there is no news.

5
00:00:16.329 --> 00:00:21.050
But for whom, I heard that Sujiayang and Beicheng Street are cooperating to develop the Gui Cry Po Project.

6
00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:23.150
I came here specially for Shanyuan,

7
00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:25.130
After all, this is waiting for our Su family,

8
00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:27.350
Come together when we are in the new special zone,

9
00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:29.150
If you don’t still cooperate with our Su family,

10
00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:31.070
There are too many masters.

11
00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:32.680
Send me a message and I'll go get it

12
00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:38.700
Can your president come to our Su family’s celebration?

13
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:39.920
It's for our Su family

14
00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:41.360
What's going on

15
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.740
Today you are going to say that Yunzhou is our world

16
00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:52.840
Why don't you go to the streets and accept our subordinates?

17
00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.440
Can Su Jia take advantage of the great opportunity of Beicheng Group?

18
00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:56.940
Very authentic atmosphere

19
00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:59.620
But the reduction may still affect itself

20
00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:02.440
I thought it was not the right way to take advantage of others

21
00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.820
And I still have something to ask for when I come today

22
00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:07.840
you are now

23
00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:09.300
This is your go-to

24
00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:11.920
And what about driving?

25
00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.540
You said you really bought this car at once

26
00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:17.890
I really look at your eyes, I look good

27
00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:20.070
Which junk shop do I work at?

28
00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.630
Received accident pawn car
