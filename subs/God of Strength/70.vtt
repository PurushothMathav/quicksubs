00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.340
Go ahead, what did you say?

2
00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:06.160
I said, this project must be something that involves alleviating concerns.

3
00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.300
I'm sorry if the care and concern are not there.

4
00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.730
Come on, stop joking, are our shareholders okay?

5
00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:16.490
At first, I thought you were out of sympathy and gave it to you.

6
00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:19.020
What did you count?

7
00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.610
Shu Lao Taijun, I am not capable of this project.

8
00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.530
Just keep going. If we can't talk,

9
00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:27.060
A little more then.

10
00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:30.550
Please stay if you move forward, move forward,

11
00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:34.690
We are equal partners in this project,

12
00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.250
Cooperate first.

13
00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:40.080
This means that even though your former boss had this attitude,

14
00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:41.760
I'm not strong enough to be a director

15
00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.040
Say you made a decision

16
00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.040
It’s not what your Su family thinks

17
00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:50.910
Go to these three Nings

18
00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.570
I, Beichen Group, can’t afford it

19
00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.920
I got out of your Su family again

20
00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.140
No other company is willing to provide these three Ning products

21
00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:59.710
This is obvious to everyone.

22
00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:02.250
We at Beichen Group are here to send you money.

23
00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.489
Otherwise, watch this movie

24
00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.200
The former president is really

25
00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.080
Jie Chong, our sister Su

26
00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:12.700
Let’s talk about the gift again

27
00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.710
Otherwise, why not take care of things?

28
00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.180
You have nothing else to do

29
00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:18.340
On a personal matter

30
00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:20.940
There are still many companies that are robbing people and asking for these 300 million yuan.

31
00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:22.840
I don't think they want more

32
00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:24.220
Extremely excited about this

33
00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:25.320
Talk about the granny area

34
00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.440
Hello, let me think about it
