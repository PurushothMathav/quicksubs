00:00:05.733 --> 00:00:07.300
How did I get back here?

2
00:00:07.466 --> 00:00:09.300
It has become what it looked like when it was a child

3
00:00:09.466 --> 00:00:12.766
And I can see monkeys with my eyes

4
00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.666
Master, you are lazy again.

5
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.266
Master, how are you?

6
00:00:18.266 --> 00:00:20.033
I miss you so much

7
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.200
Say such mushy words

8
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.000
That's not like you.

9
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.500
Master, I lost

10
00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.033
Please leave me here

11
00:00:28.266 --> 00:00:29.466
Pardon me?

12
00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.333
I said I lost.

13
00:00:31.333 --> 00:00:32.133
shut up

14
00:00:32.933 --> 00:00:34.366
Let me forget

15
00:00:34.733 --> 00:00:37.366
How did Zaixuan Gate teach you?

16
00:00:37.366 --> 00:00:40.133
Don't say failure here

17
00:00:40.133 --> 00:00:41.566
Don't say give up

18
00:00:41.566 --> 00:00:44.466
I can't live like a coward

19
00:00:44.466 --> 00:00:46.766
You have to learn to stand up on your own

20
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.966
master

21
00:00:47.966 --> 00:00:51.366
At that time, Luo Zhan, who was not afraid of heaven and earth

22
00:00:51.366 --> 00:00:53.266
Where did you go?

23
00:00:53.366 --> 00:00:56.900
Where is Luo Zhan, who wants to be first in everything?

24
00:00:57.133 --> 00:01:00.666
Even at the last moment

25
00:01:01.166 --> 00:01:04.900
Where did Luo Zhan, who refused to admit defeat, go?
