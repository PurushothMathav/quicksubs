00:00:01.766 --> 00:00:03.800
Such a handsome face

2
00:00:04.066 --> 00:00:06.800
It's a pity it's an acacia

3
00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:10.066
Isn't the blind just what I want?

4
00:00:10.333 --> 00:00:13.866
So no matter how bad I have a relationship with him

5
00:00:13.866 --> 00:00:16.433
He can't see what he's doing.

6
00:00:16.866 --> 00:00:19.000
Take it easy little brother

7
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.100
Can you stay here with me from now on?

8
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.200
I didn't expect my inner shadow to be so powerful

9
00:00:26.533 --> 00:00:28.500
Three stars were born

10
00:00:28.966 --> 00:00:31.566
How do you mean?

11
00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.366
You don't really want to be here

12
00:00:34.933 --> 00:00:37.400
You did it for those three irrelevant women back then

13
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.066
Self-destructing eyes

14
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:41.500
It hurts.

15
00:00:41.966 --> 00:00:43.366
Even so

16
00:00:43.366 --> 00:00:45.700
You can still break through the difficulties and obstacles

17
00:00:45.733 --> 00:00:47.333
Become a Valkyrie

18
00:00:47.333 --> 00:00:49.700
Such an obsessed body

19
00:00:49.733 --> 00:00:51.766
It's hard to be unsettling.

20
00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.733
Since you care so much about me

21
00:00:53.733 --> 00:00:55.766
Then I'll make you disappear completely

22
00:00:55.966 --> 00:00:58.566
You don't understand.

23
00:00:58.566 --> 00:01:00.300
So cruel!

24
00:01:05.266 --> 00:01:06.466
Stupid stuff

25
00:01:06.466 --> 00:01:09.166
You can't hurt me here

26
00:01:09.166 --> 00:01:10.433
That's it.

27
00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.466
We are the shadow of your heart

28
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.800
Your every move has endless control
