00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:01.600
Strange things happen every year

2
00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:02.966
This year is especially many

3
00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:05.400
A blind man who cannot see

4
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.100
This is actually connected to the first divine sword in the world

5
00:00:09.133 --> 00:00:10.033
What Excalibur?

6
00:00:10.466 --> 00:00:12.500
I think this sword is fake too

7
00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:13.666
I have seven seconds.

8
00:00:13.766 --> 00:00:14.700
fame

9
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.133
Come on guys, please listen to me

10
00:00:17.133 --> 00:00:18.366
This Wu Ganjian

11
00:00:18.366 --> 00:00:20.600
It is the guardian of my Xiao family through the ages

12
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.266
It's not fake.

13
00:00:22.266 --> 00:00:23.700
This five-fingered maniac

14
00:00:24.133 --> 00:00:25.233
With my permission

15
00:00:25.366 --> 00:00:27.066
Robbed by my sister without permission

16
00:00:27.133 --> 00:00:30.966
Please also ask the four Humas to call the shots for Xiao Wang

17
00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:32.266
Don't worry.

18
00:00:32.766 --> 00:00:34.233
There are four of us

19
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.400
I don't have that ability yet

20
00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.366
Brother, I think this kid has some skills

21
00:00:39.366 --> 00:00:41.933
Now he has a dust-free sword

22
00:00:41.933 --> 00:00:44.000
How can we save lives?

23
00:00:44.066 --> 00:00:45.266
Don't forget.

24
00:00:45.266 --> 00:00:46.400
Don't forget.

25
00:00:46.933 --> 00:00:48.000
And that trick

26
00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:49.400
What!

27
00:00:49.933 --> 00:00:51.233
Really have that trick

28
00:00:51.533 --> 00:00:53.800
That's so exciting

29
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.233
This is the ultimate of our four protectors

30
00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:57.300
work hard

31
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.266
The commander is here

32
00:01:07.333 --> 00:01:09.700
It turned out to be the legendary Tiangang Battle Formation

33
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.000
I want to see this irredeemable thing

34
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.166
How to respond

35
00:01:13.166 --> 00:01:14.866
I thought it was a trick

36
00:01:14.866 --> 00:01:16.966
It turned out to be the battle that day
