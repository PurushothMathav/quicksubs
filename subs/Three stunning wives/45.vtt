00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:02.466
Hey, stand there for me

2
00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:04.066
You stinky driver

3
00:00:04.333 --> 00:00:06.300
If it weren't for Lao Tzu's driver having a stomachache one day

4
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:08.400
Can it be your turn to drive a dirty guy like me?

5
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:09.400
I am flattering

6
00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:11.100
Did I hear it wrong just now?

7
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:12.333
The poor man said

8
00:00:12.333 --> 00:00:14.133
He is also here for the wedding party

9
00:00:14.133 --> 00:00:15.200
That's right. That's right.

10
00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.700
What Mandarin do you speak in broad daylight?

11
00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:18.966
Just laughing to death

12
00:00:18.966 --> 00:00:20.100
You heard right

13
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.600
I'm here to participate in today's Fang Family Lianyun Banquet

14
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:23.133
and

15
00:00:23.133 --> 00:00:25.666
I can come to give their Fang family a chance.

16
00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:28.866
Are you confused with a fever?

17
00:00:28.866 --> 00:00:31.166
What are you?

18
00:00:31.166 --> 00:00:34.300
Pretending to force him to come in front of Lao Tzu, hahaha

19
00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.600
Immediately you see he's blind

20
00:00:36.733 --> 00:00:38.933
Why did we just drive here?

21
00:00:38.933 --> 00:00:41.333
God, isn't this murder?

22
00:00:41.333 --> 00:00:44.000
Immediately, how can the noble status suffer such humiliation?

23
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.266
I don't have a good plan

24
00:00:45.533 --> 00:00:48.000
But I didn't get you there safely.

25
00:00:48.066 --> 00:00:52.100
Didn't I drive steadily enough along the way just now?

26
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.666
Keep it open. What's wrong?

27
00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:55.600
Who made you drive so steadily?

28
00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:56.966
The old man hates stability the most

29
00:00:56.966 --> 00:00:59.666
Oops, now you see that arrogant look?

30
00:00:59.666 --> 00:01:00.966
You stinky driver

31
00:01:01.566 --> 00:01:03.500
You don't want to live anymore, do you?

32
00:01:03.566 --> 00:01:05.800
No one dares to talk to me like that next week

33
00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.000
If you offend, you will die immediately.

34
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.300
Don't say I didn't give you a chance.

35
00:01:10.466 --> 00:01:14.000
Now kneel down and kowtow to me, and I will admit my mistake

36
00:01:14.566 --> 00:01:15.500
forgive
