1
00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:01.866
Welcome all the way here.

2
00:00:01.866 --> 00:00:03.533
Participate in the Xiao family's martial arts recruitment

3
00:00:03.533 --> 00:00:06.166
It's not your Xiao family that put a bronze mirror here

4
00:00:06.166 --> 00:00:07.000
block the way

5
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.033
What do you mean?

6
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.600
I'm going to explain.

7
00:00:11.333 --> 00:00:12.966
This is the Sword Mirror

8
00:00:12.966 --> 00:00:15.700
He can see the demons in this world

9
00:00:15.733 --> 00:00:18.633
This is the threshold for recruiting relatives in this competition

10
00:00:18.733 --> 00:00:19.533
What!

11
00:00:19.666 --> 00:00:22.266
It is actually one of the Eight Desolate Artifacts, the Sword Mirror

12
00:00:22.866 --> 00:00:25.266
Thinking of the Xiao family having such an air

13
00:00:25.266 --> 00:00:27.566
The Xiao family blocked the sword demon sword here

14
00:00:27.566 --> 00:00:28.866
What does it mean?

15
00:00:28.866 --> 00:00:30.433
The devil conqueror's heart falls to his heart

16
00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:32.266
If you cherish your blessings, the demons will retreat

17
00:00:32.266 --> 00:00:35.366
It seems that the Xiao family wants to give everyone a difficult problem.

18
00:00:35.366 --> 00:00:36.866
If there is no magic in your heart

19
00:00:36.933 --> 00:00:38.333
Can pass smoothly

20
00:00:38.333 --> 00:00:39.833
If there is a demon in your heart

21
00:00:39.933 --> 00:00:41.700
You must overcome your demons

22
00:00:41.733 --> 00:00:44.100
Only those who are eligible to participate in this competition

23
00:00:44.133 --> 00:00:47.166
I didn't expect this competition to recruit relatives

24
00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.333
The unfathomable martial arts of Shenluo Zhan monk

25
00:00:49.333 --> 00:00:50.433
It came too

26
00:00:51.466 --> 00:00:54.033
There is no magic in my heart

27
00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:58.166
I will come to Beihai Hero

28
00:00:58.166 --> 00:01:00.166
A martial arts genius

29
00:01:00.166 --> 00:01:02.166
The peak of strength

30
00:01:11.133 --> 00:01:12.966
I got it

31
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.000
Why is he blind?

32
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.466
It's really overkill

33
00:01:16.466 --> 00:01:18.266
You just saw it too

34
00:01:18.266 --> 00:01:19.700
I want to remind you

35
00:01:19.766 --> 00:01:21.700
If you are turned against by the devil

36
00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.666
Consequences of return are natural

37
00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.566
Come on, come on.
