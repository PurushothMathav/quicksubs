1
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.400
Elude me to the parking lot

2
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.666
I'll give you a tip of 100 bucks.

3
00:00:13.133 --> 00:00:14.333
I'm sorry, big brother.

4
00:00:14.333 --> 00:00:16.333
I'm also here to attend the All Things Conference.

5
00:00:16.333 --> 00:00:18.066
Do your own thing

6
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.333
Your feet are really facial.

7
00:00:20.333 --> 00:00:23.300
Anyone who takes the plunge can drive for them

8
00:00:23.666 --> 00:00:27.366
He also said that he was here to participate in the network conference

9
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:28.300
Listen.

10
00:00:28.466 --> 00:00:31.366
The Congress of Nations is our own event next week

11
00:00:31.366 --> 00:00:34.100
No matter who I am, whether I can participate or not

12
00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:35.600
It's not your turn to look

13
00:00:36.066 --> 00:00:37.366
Pointing fingers

14
00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.033
Be obedient next time.

15
00:00:39.533 --> 00:00:42.266
My hope, which fears the moon and welcomes the country, covers your palm

16
00:00:42.266 --> 00:00:43.200
The identity of the enemy sword

17
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.333
In my country

18
00:00:44.333 --> 00:00:46.133
You have no right to talk to me

19
00:00:46.133 --> 00:00:48.833
I urge you to kneel down and apologize to me immediately

20
00:00:49.666 --> 00:00:52.566
What? English dumplings?

21
00:00:52.566 --> 00:00:54.033
Why haven't you heard of it?
