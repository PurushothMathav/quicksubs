1
00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.700
Make a big move here

2
00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:03.600
No one has dared to talk to Master Qin like that

3
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:04.966
Not afraid of death

4
00:00:05.466 --> 00:00:08.000
I really don't know the power of the Temple of Wealth

5
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.133
You are the first to dare to speak to me in this tone

6
00:00:11.133 --> 00:00:12.933
But I'm in a good mood today.

7
00:00:12.933 --> 00:00:16.033
You kneel down and kowtow to me three times

8
00:00:16.266 --> 00:00:17.333
I forgive you

9
00:00:17.333 --> 00:00:21.466
Forgive, do you think the Temple of Wealth can forgive you?

10
00:00:21.466 --> 00:00:23.066
Can I forgive you?

11
00:00:23.066 --> 00:00:25.566
Can I forgive you?

12
00:00:25.566 --> 00:00:26.366
OK

13
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.100
What a pity to have the courage!

14
00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:32.900
Even a Valkyrie can't walk out today

15
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.100
This is Tian Xiaojun

16
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.266
The best-equipped job in the world

17
00:00:44.266 --> 00:00:46.266
It is also the most expensive job

18
00:00:46.333 --> 00:00:47.133
these

19
00:00:47.133 --> 00:00:50.166
The average annual salary of each person exceeds 100 million

20
00:00:50.166 --> 00:00:52.000
As expected of this year

21
00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.900
Be a good gatekeeper of the Temple of Wealth

22
00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:58.433
Can afford this sky-high marketing army

23
00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.200
Land battle, go away

24
00:01:00.366 --> 00:01:02.400
This is the invincible marketing army

25
00:01:02.666 --> 00:01:05.233
You have no chance of leaving

26
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.466
It's too late now

27
00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.166
Today I will let you, the god of war, die

28
00:01:10.166 --> 00:01:11.000
future

29
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.833
Your martial world will bow down like my financial world

30
00:01:14.266 --> 00:01:17.933
Lord God of Wealth may send me to His Highness the Grand Palace

31
00:01:17.933 --> 00:01:19.566
It's beautiful what you think

32
00:01:19.566 --> 00:01:22.633
But do you really think that with these marketing armies

33
00:01:22.966 --> 00:01:24.200
You can get trapped
