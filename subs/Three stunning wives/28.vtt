00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:03.000
What kind of martial arts of the Valkyrie Platform?

2
00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:05.700
Could it be that he is really from the Martial God Platform?

3
00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:07.066
How is that possible?

4
00:00:07.066 --> 00:00:09.866
How could there be a blind man on the Martial God Platform?

5
00:00:09.866 --> 00:00:12.100
Coincidence is definitely coincidence

6
00:00:12.133 --> 00:00:14.000
His division commander 2 counts zombies

7
00:00:14.166 --> 00:00:15.533
Otherwise, he is blind

8
00:00:15.533 --> 00:00:17.300
How could it be the opponent of the spirit beast?

9
00:00:17.366 --> 00:00:18.666
Give me peace

10
00:00:20.366 --> 00:00:21.666
Bold and Small

11
00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:24.266
How dare you steal the martial arts of my Martial God Platform

12
00:00:24.266 --> 00:00:25.566
I see

13
00:00:25.566 --> 00:00:28.900
No wonder this kid dares to be so fearless

14
00:00:28.966 --> 00:00:31.533
It turned out that he stole the martial arts of the Wushentai

15
00:00:31.533 --> 00:00:32.700
Lord Zhang Jieshi

16
00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.200
This trash stole the martial arts of the Martial God Platform

17
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.566
It seems that only you have shot

18
00:00:37.733 --> 00:00:39.666
Please be seven feet long. Adults must

19
00:00:40.066 --> 00:00:41.300
To rectify the law

20
00:00:41.366 --> 00:00:44.400
Please make it so that adults will correct the law

21
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.666
Please make it so that adults must correct the law

22
00:00:47.666 --> 00:00:50.900
Please ask a seven-foot-long adult to correct the law

23
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.066
It seems that I can't keep you

24
00:00:54.566 --> 00:00:55.566
Go ahead.

25
00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:57.666
How do you want to play?

26
00:00:57.666 --> 00:01:00.866
You're so arrogant when you're dying

27
00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:02.200
arrogant

28
00:01:03.166 --> 00:01:05.166
Men don't cut the wind and clouds

29
00:01:05.333 --> 00:01:07.833
Born with an eight-foot body on an empty stomach

30
00:01:07.933 --> 00:01:10.800
You've forgotten the commandments of the Pentateuch

31
00:01:11.066 --> 00:01:13.433
No one knows it in the commandments mantra of Takesutai

32
00:01:13.466 --> 00:01:16.033
It seems that he has been stealing from Takeseidai for a long time

33
00:01:16.133 --> 00:01:18.200
You think I'm stealing from Takeseidai

34
00:01:18.566 --> 00:01:21.500
Then I'd like to see how many moves you can take from me
