1
00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:02.900
If you are willing to consciously sell nothing

2
00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:03.900
A waste

3
00:00:04.166 --> 00:00:07.800
Then I can promise unrelated people in the room

4
00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.566
I'm not lucky to marry them

5
00:00:10.466 --> 00:00:12.033
This is our last chance.

6
00:00:12.166 --> 00:00:14.166
After a moment, the scene was restored

7
00:00:14.166 --> 00:00:17.800
Not even this last chance

8
00:00:17.933 --> 00:00:20.800
No, if you are conscious of the divine vein

9
00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.166
The Valkyrie you have painstakingly studied all these years

10
00:00:23.166 --> 00:00:24.866
The body of the God of Wealth will disappear

11
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
The power of the gods will also be gone

12
00:00:27.133 --> 00:00:29.433
Yes, once judged consciously

13
00:00:29.866 --> 00:00:31.700
Not even the last hope

14
00:00:31.733 --> 00:00:33.100
Don't trust him.

15
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.300
This is not conducive to suicide

16
00:00:35.533 --> 00:00:36.800
Absolutely not.

17
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.466
It's come to this point, what are you still hesitating about?

18
00:00:39.666 --> 00:00:42.100
Do you want everyone to die with you?

19
00:00:42.266 --> 00:00:43.566
Hurry up and call him wrong

20
00:00:43.566 --> 00:00:45.100
Don't implicate the rest of us

21
00:00:45.333 --> 00:00:46.366
world demeanor

22
00:00:46.366 --> 00:00:47.466
world demeanor

23
00:00:47.733 --> 00:00:50.000
Hahahaha interesting

24
00:00:53.066 --> 00:00:55.866
This scene is so wronged

25
00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.900
This is what you just fought so hard to protect

26
00:01:00.066 --> 00:01:01.766
You look at them.

27
00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:04.700
I don't seem to care at all
