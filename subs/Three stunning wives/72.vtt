00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:02.000
When is the first sword

2
00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:04.033
Dustless sword you

3
00:00:04.333 --> 00:00:05.766
What the hell are you?

4
00:00:06.466 --> 00:00:08.800
What is the enemy sword?

5
00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:12.400
It's just a broken cocoon of an ordinary weapon

6
00:00:12.566 --> 00:00:13.700
Prince John

7
00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:15.166
You don't know

8
00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.300
This is our first Excalibur next week

9
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:18.700
Unsheathed is recommended.

10
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.433
Vantage Potian

11
00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:21.766
Zhenhai Chaosheng

12
00:00:22.133 --> 00:00:26.466
It is indeed much more precious than your Star Lake Realm

13
00:00:27.066 --> 00:00:28.100
Nonsense

14
00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:30.200
If your sword is so powerful

15
00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:31.966
Cut the sword on me

16
00:00:31.966 --> 00:00:34.500
If you can't hurt me, I support you.

17
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.666
Prove that your sword is the same as yours.

18
00:00:38.666 --> 00:00:40.000
You've figured it out

19
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.400
Dustless Sword is unsheathed

20
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.300
It's not as simple as slapping you

21
00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:44.400
This price

22
00:00:45.466 --> 00:00:46.666
Can you afford it?

23
00:00:46.933 --> 00:00:51.833
Stop talking nonsense, I think you are more stupid

24
00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:54.500
Don't think the lights are on

25
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.200
You brought this on yourself.

26
00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:03.500
Hahaha

27
00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:07.433
Your sword is as lazy as your men

28
00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:15.100
you

29
00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:16.966
I beg your pardon.

30
00:01:17.133 --> 00:01:18.400
That's not possible.

31
00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:20.400
My son of a bitch

32
00:01:20.933 --> 00:01:24.066
Impossible. Our glass is missing

33
00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:25.833
How could you forget?

34
00:01:26.333 --> 00:01:27.366
My sword

35
00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.466
I will kill you for a hundred years

36
00:01:29.466 --> 00:01:34.266
As the so-called one sword frost cold fourteen states
