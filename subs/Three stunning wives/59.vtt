So rampant

Lord Qin Qin

4
00:00:04.366 --> 00:00:06.100
This is the gatekeeper of our temple of wealth

5
00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:07.266
Lord Qin doesn't know

6
00:00:07.266 --> 00:00:10.000
Qin Ye Qin is far from our Fang family banquet

7
00:00:10.066 --> 00:00:11.500
Don't blame me.

It's so lively here today!

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:28.500
Next week's celebrity families are almost all here

16
00:00:29.733 --> 00:00:31.233
Why are there still five fathers?

17
00:00:31.766 --> 00:00:34.066
Today this one is called Luo Zhan

18
00:00:34.066 --> 00:00:35.766
Claiming to be a Valkyrie

19
00:00:35.766 --> 00:00:37.133
Don't take our money at all

20
00:00:37.133 --> 00:00:39.000
Even the Temple of Wealth is in your eyes

21
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.766
He also said that he was very familiar with the town monkey

00:00:40.766 --> 00:00:42.500
I just don't know the sky and the earth

23
00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.266
What Valkyrie?

24
00:00:44.266 --> 00:00:46.033
Also stay with the town prince

25
00:00:46.133 --> 00:00:47.433
Yeah, might as well.

26
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.000
What kind of person is Xiaozhen Cai Hou?

27
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.866
I am afraid that the old man will get the true biography of the God of Wealth

palm

29
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.700
How can next week's wealth be king with a guy like you?

30
00:00:55.933 --> 00:00:57.600
That's right, my dear father is here

31
00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.400
How dare you fart here?

32
00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.266
A piece of junk that only becomes a word fast

33
00:01:02.266 --> 00:01:04.266
If you really have that kind of strength

34
00:01:04.266 --> 00:01:05.933
Just let me see for myself

35
00:01:05.933 --> 00:01:08.666
Otherwise don't embarrass yourself here

36
00:01:09.333 --> 00:01:14.033
Okay, then I'll cut you open today
