00:00:01.333 --> 00:00:03.900
Didn't Xiaoyue hear what the Protector said?

2
00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:05.100
You go and give him a sword

3
00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:06.766
Draw a line with that trash

4
00:00:06.766 --> 00:00:08.933
We can't let him lead our Xiao family

5
00:00:08.933 --> 00:00:11.300
The Dustless Sword is the Sword of IQ

6
00:00:11.333 --> 00:00:12.533
No matter how powerful he is

7
00:00:12.533 --> 00:00:14.800
How can you withstand the danger of this sword?

8
00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:16.300
But if you don't give this sword

9
00:00:16.333 --> 00:00:18.600
Xiao Jia will definitely be implicated by the Wushentai

10
00:00:18.733 --> 00:00:20.466
Maybe there will be destruction

11
00:00:20.933 --> 00:00:22.166
What should I do?

12
00:00:22.266 --> 00:00:24.700
I didn't expect the Martial God to be the four guardians

13
00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:26.500
To make things difficult for a girl

14
00:00:26.766 --> 00:00:29.766
It's not that we're making things difficult for him now

15
00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:30.866
It was the Xiao family

16
00:00:30.866 --> 00:00:31.900
To sin with you

17
00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:34.400
It turns the dead into boundaries

18
00:00:34.533 --> 00:00:35.333
We

19
00:00:35.733 --> 00:00:37.733
Just give him a chance

20
00:00:37.733 --> 00:00:39.300
Xiaoyue, don't you do it yet?

21
00:00:39.366 --> 00:00:42.966
Is this a joke about the hundreds of names of the Xiao family?

22
00:00:52.766 --> 00:00:55.866
When you introduced me to the Xiao family, it was broken and injured

23
00:00:55.866 --> 00:00:56.700
But now

24
00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:59.300
I can't rule over the lives of the Xiao family

25
00:00:59.333 --> 00:01:00.566
Anyway.

26
00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.266
You are not willing to take the Valkyrie as your enemy

27
00:01:05.933 --> 00:01:08.166
The ancient altar was founded by me

28
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.066
Why don't you believe it?

29
00:01:11.866 --> 00:01:13.266
I am godless

30
00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.200
It seems that your obsessions and delusions are deeply ingrained

31
00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:21.700
Don't blame me
