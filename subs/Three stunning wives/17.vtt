00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:03.300
Do you think you have passed this level of the Sword Demon Mirror?

2
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:04.833
You can participate in the competition to recruit relatives

3
00:00:04.966 --> 00:00:06.166
But who?

4
00:00:06.166 --> 00:00:09.033
You can marry our Miss Xiao at will

5
00:00:09.533 --> 00:00:14.333
A blind man or a stinky price to be infatuated with joy

6
00:00:14.333 --> 00:00:16.866
Your servants of the Xiao family really have no rules.

7
00:00:16.866 --> 00:00:18.266
Even if forced away

8
00:00:18.733 --> 00:00:22.466
Guiyin really puts gold on his face

9
00:00:22.533 --> 00:00:24.033
Where are you kneeling?

10
00:00:24.133 --> 00:00:26.000
Is kneeling on a pair of blind eyes

11
00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.700
Or is it your identity as a descendant driver?

12
00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:29.900
Where do I kneel?

13
00:00:30.666 --> 00:00:32.500
How can someone like you have a problem?

14
00:00:32.533 --> 00:00:36.100
Bold dog thing, I think you've lived enough

15
00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.366
Our Xiao family will be a top-class family of three generations next week

16
00:00:39.366 --> 00:00:41.533
What status do you dare to offend us?

17
00:00:41.533 --> 00:00:44.900
I am your Miss Xiao who personally invited me here

18
00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:48.800
If you block the Hengjia here, you will not be afraid of the Xiao family taking you

19
00:00:49.333 --> 00:00:51.766
Miss Jiao, what is your identity?

20
00:00:51.866 --> 00:00:55.266
Our Miss Xiao will not look at you more

21
00:00:55.466 --> 00:00:57.666
Look at everyone here today

22
00:00:57.666 --> 00:01:00.266
Which one is not a celebrity in the Five Realms?

23
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.066
He is blind hahaha

24
00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.166
I'm going to ask you again.

25
00:01:12.366 --> 00:01:14.666
Am I eligible to attend the meeting?

26
00:01:16.066 --> 00:01:18.000
This Liu Jinhan

27
00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:19.400
I can't see it.

28
00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:20.666
But I can imagine

29
00:01:20.666 --> 00:01:23.666
What should be on your face at this moment?

30
00:01:23.966 --> 00:01:24.800
interesting

31
00:01:25.933 --> 00:01:27.033
I have no eyes

32
00:01:27.133 --> 00:01:29.166
No offense, please come in.

33
00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:30.700
out of the way

34
00:01:41.666 --> 00:01:44.366
I didn't expect this trash to come in.

35
00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:49.100
Go give him some color, yeah
