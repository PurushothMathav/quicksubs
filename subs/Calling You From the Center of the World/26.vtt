00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:03.190
You also came to meet Beizi the day before yesterday.

2
00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:06.380
What has this Beizi been doing with my brother?

3
00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:08.940
Isn’t it possible for anyone to know scriptures and poems?

4
00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:11.550
I heard you saw me? I see,

5
00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:13.950
Are you really lying and not daring to submit?

6
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.600
Lie this is the sun,

7
00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.130
Your Majesty will take you to heaven again,

8
00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.110
Believe it is coming,

9
00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.570
Confucius’ sun, you are different,

10
00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:53.650
Next to the sky,

11
00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:56.340
Then add the amount of imperial color,

12
00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.440
With the sixth graders, dip your hands,

13
00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:00.430
If you eat well, you should be able to recover.

14
00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:03.220
Still pretending.

15
00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:07.860
I've had this bag on my back for so many years

16
00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:10.460
Many places have already fallen apart

17
00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:11.900
He could actually say it

18
00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:15.020
how do you know

19
00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.000
You are not the original appearance of this back
