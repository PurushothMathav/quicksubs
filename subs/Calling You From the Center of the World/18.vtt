00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:10.130
How is Dad doing now?

2
00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:13.990
When you wake up, how often will you turn your eyes and pass by in exchange for the bellfish you brought?

3
00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:17.070
Dad has already moved away. You can take shelter from the wind and take care of yourself first.

4
00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:27.020
What if it wasn't for Zishui? I'll take the money. Thank you.

5
00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:38.720
After giving birth, I will chase you wherever you go.

6
00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:41.950
please young lady

7
00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:43.930
In ramen you are sick now

8
00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:45.330
Be sure to replenish more nutrients

9
00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:51.210
I've eaten

10
00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:52.330
It took a long time to eat

11
00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.110
It's like having a drink

12
00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.870
on that first day

13
00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.240
A piece of water with a portion for you to eat

14
00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.260
He also said you were full

15
00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:28.920
Dad, life is not hard

16
00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.980
It’s not hard for me to have a bully at all

17
00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:40.810
Is that so heartfelt? It’s really touching.
