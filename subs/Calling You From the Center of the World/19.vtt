00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.320
Miss, isn’t it enough to cultivate into us first?

2
00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:06.020
My dad is already like this, so why bother provoking him?

3
00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:10.110
Look at what you said, don't you have money for surgery?

4
00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:13.600
I am so kind-hearted that I came to give you money.

5
00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:16.990
I wonder if you are not willing to lend us money?

6
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:19.480
Why are you so kind-hearted all of a sudden?

7
00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:21.520
As long as you are lucky enough to win, it will be hurtful to be looked down upon by the king.

8
00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.830
But I'll just leave you with one sentence.

9
00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:30.550
As long as you don't let him sleep on the road, what will he say to you?

10
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.710
What did you say? I am your sister-in-law in name only.

11
00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.530
There are so many of you? There are so many of you? Don’t say anything? I am your sister-in-law in name only. There are so many of you? There are so many of you? Don’t say anything? Don’t say anything? I’m good She is your nominal sister-in-law. You

12
00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.850
Do you know how you can fix your skirt so quickly, sister-in-law?

13
00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:39.410
What do you think about Brother Guqun?

14
00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:40.510
Have you ever admitted it?

15
00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:43.920
You are too bullying

16
00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.240
My old bones are just dead

17
00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:50.510
I won’t let my daughter buy my own good things either.

18
00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:52.930
Your daughter is being watched by Wangshe

19
00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:54.370
That's his line

20
00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:56.450
Don't beg us then

21
00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.450
You really can't buy a good home. Only you and I know.

22
00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:02.520
He's not here to bully

23
00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.640
I don't dare to leave

24
00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:05.770
This is the ice house

25
00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:06.890
women need rest

26
00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:08.150
Please go out

27
00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.120
Qian Who let you be so talkative?

28
00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:15.360
What are you doing
