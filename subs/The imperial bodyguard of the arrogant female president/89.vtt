00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.200
I heard that Yi Xue was seriously ill and bedridden

2
00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:04.500
Someone can cure it but not

3
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:05.400
Yes!

4
00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:09.166
There is a rebel of the Qin family who can always cure a blood disease

5
00:00:09.166 --> 00:00:11.500
Don't treat him

6
00:00:11.666 --> 00:00:15.066
If he doesn't cure me, I want to see how many lives he has

7
00:00:15.666 --> 00:00:17.966
Where's Yi Xue? Take me to see him. Okay

8
00:00:17.966 --> 00:00:18.800
Young Master Yan please

9
00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:26.600
How are you?

10
00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:27.600
I told you.

11
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.000
I don't want to be a victim of my family's interests

12
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.066
Don't worry about me.

13
00:00:31.066 --> 00:00:32.566
I simply like you.

14
00:00:32.566 --> 00:00:34.100
But I have someone I like

15
00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.866
who

16
00:00:34.866 --> 00:00:37.866
The one who refused to treat me?

17
00:00:37.966 --> 00:00:38.800
You like him?

18
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.366
He won't even treat you

19
00:00:40.366 --> 00:00:41.333
You still like him?

20
00:00:41.333 --> 00:00:43.966
He didn't treat me because Dong Jia was sorry for him

21
00:00:43.966 --> 00:00:45.100
It's not his fault.

22
00:00:45.133 --> 00:00:46.666
outrageous

23
00:00:46.933 --> 00:00:50.266
Hu Jun brought that kid to me

24
00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:01.600
Where is the love war
