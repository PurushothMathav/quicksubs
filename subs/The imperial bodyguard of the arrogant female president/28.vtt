1
00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:01.666
How about Shen Longshan?

2
00:00:01.666 --> 00:00:04.200
What else do you want to do with my godfather?

3
00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.700
Shen Longshan, you dare to touch my people

4
00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:09.900
God, it was Zhao Hailong who kidnapped my old friend

5
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.633
I just came to him for a theory

6
00:00:11.666 --> 00:00:13.700
The sea dragon has a reason for doing things

7
00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:15.033
What are you going to theorize about?

8
00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:16.766
Like self-care

9
00:00:16.766 --> 00:00:19.233
Otherwise I encounter life force

10
00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:21.566
The Shen family is barren

11
00:00:22.666 --> 00:00:25.666
Grandpa, you must make the decision for me.

12
00:00:25.666 --> 00:00:28.666
What's wrong with me being a grandson?

13
00:00:28.666 --> 00:00:30.866
I want to marry the daughter of the Shen family

14
00:00:30.966 --> 00:00:32.900
But he disagrees. Hum.

15
00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:34.866
You have to say something for me

16
00:00:34.866 --> 00:00:36.166
Xing Shenlongshan

17
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.066
My grandson has a crush on your daughter

18
00:00:39.066 --> 00:00:42.133
Dad, your daughter will marry my grandson.

19
00:00:42.133 --> 00:00:44.100
I'll cover you if something happens in the newspaper

20
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.466
Or I'll make you fall from heaven to hell

21
00:00:47.466 --> 00:00:49.466
Swallow is absolutely not possible

22
00:00:49.466 --> 00:00:52.500
I wouldn't sacrifice my daughter's happiness if I beat her to death

23
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.700
The answer you dare to disobey me

24
00:00:54.733 --> 00:00:56.866
What about you?

25
00:00:56.866 --> 00:00:58.000
If you dare to come

26
00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.200
See if I slap you

27
00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:02.966
Who are you to dare to speak to this old man in such a tone?

28
00:01:02.966 --> 00:01:03.766
Godfather

29
00:01:03.766 --> 00:01:06.233
He's just a stinky security guard from out of town

30
00:01:06.366 --> 00:01:07.366
How dare he hit me?

31
00:01:07.366 --> 00:01:08.533
Who wants to die?

32
00:01:08.533 --> 00:01:11.600
You, a security guard, dare to tell the old man in such a tone

33
00:01:11.733 --> 00:01:14.400
It doesn't seem to destroy your wealth

34
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.500
Heaven is not allowed

35
00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:16.733
You wait for me.

36
00:01:16.733 --> 00:01:18.233
I'll be right there.

37
00:01:18.933 --> 00:01:20.666
Godfather, we are waiting for you

38
00:01:20.666 --> 00:01:22.466
Hey, hahaha.

39
00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.366
You have angered God

40
00:01:24.366 --> 00:01:26.266
See how you die
