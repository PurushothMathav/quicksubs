1
00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:01.266
Who dares

2
00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.200
Help me now

3
00:00:06.733 --> 00:00:08.500
Invade you don't force me

4
00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:10.100
You know my ability to kill

5
00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:12.000
I also know the consequences of my murder

6
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:13.466
Here we go.

7
00:00:16.866 --> 00:00:19.000
I hope this doesn't happen again

8
00:00:22.366 --> 00:00:23.200
waste

9
00:00:26.766 --> 00:00:27.933
Who the hell are you?

10
00:00:27.933 --> 00:00:30.066
Ordinary People Ordinary People

11
00:00:30.366 --> 00:00:32.333
Then why do even princesses like you?

12
00:00:32.333 --> 00:00:34.533
Even afraid of you

13
00:00:34.533 --> 00:00:36.433
I used to be his bodyguard

14
00:00:36.466 --> 00:00:38.266
He would like a bodyguard

15
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.000
You think all women are just as snobbish as you

16
00:00:43.533 --> 00:00:45.900
If you hadn't killed my dad

17
00:00:46.166 --> 00:00:47.566
I wouldn't hate you so much

18
00:00:47.566 --> 00:00:48.766
I don't want to argue with you.

19
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.200
You go to rest first

20
00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.800
I still have something to go out.

21
00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.966
What else do you have to do so late?

22
00:00:57.966 --> 00:01:00.100
What has nothing to do with you?

23
00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:11.500
Dad?

24
00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:13.800
The anniversary of your death is coming

25
00:01:13.933 --> 00:01:15.266
The negative side of the family

26
00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.400
It's countdown time.
