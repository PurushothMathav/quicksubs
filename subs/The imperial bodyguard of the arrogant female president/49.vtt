1
00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:02.266
Shen Shu's lung cancer was caused by poisoning

2
00:00:02.333 --> 00:00:04.233
What poisoning?

3
00:00:04.366 --> 00:00:06.533
Yes, Dad.

4
00:00:06.533 --> 00:00:08.000
Have you ever been poisoned?

5
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.133
Mr. Shen is so violent

6
00:00:23.133 --> 00:00:24.500
The ability below

7
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.666
It can only be delayed but not solved.

8
00:00:29.266 --> 00:00:31.766
I have lived 10 more years

9
00:00:31.766 --> 00:00:34.433
No regrets from now on

10
00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.100
What can you do?

11
00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:37.800
We have to find out what poison is in it first

12
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.166
Then you should check it quickly.

13
00:00:39.166 --> 00:00:39.933
Too long

14
00:00:39.933 --> 00:00:41.333
I must drink the sparkling blood

15
00:00:41.333 --> 00:00:43.133
You can only find out if you are also poisoned.

16
00:00:43.133 --> 00:00:44.266
No way!

17
00:00:44.266 --> 00:00:45.700
It's too dangerous

18
00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:46.933
I'm not afraid of danger

19
00:00:46.933 --> 00:00:49.500
It's just that I still have one important thing to do.

20
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:50.566
Can't take the risk

21
00:00:50.566 --> 00:00:52.800
Uncle Shen, please go through it first.

22
00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:55.166
Is there anything else?

23
00:00:55.166 --> 00:00:56.400
Make a condition

24
00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:57.300
What kind of condition?

25
00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.500
How can I help my dad test the medicine?

26
00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.200
Help my dad get better
