00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:01.266
As long as you nod

2
00:00:01.266 --> 00:00:02.933
I would like to marry you as my wife

3
00:00:02.933 --> 00:00:03.966
Excuse me.

4
00:00:03.966 --> 00:00:05.800
I have no interest in women

5
00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:07.566
That's what I heard

6
00:00:07.566 --> 00:00:09.966
There are princesses from at least dozens of countries

7
00:00:09.966 --> 00:00:10.933
And widow daughter

8
00:00:10.933 --> 00:00:12.200
To marry a emperor

9
00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:13.966
They were all rejected by the First Emperor

10
00:00:13.966 --> 00:00:16.566
Legends like One Emperor

11
00:00:16.766 --> 00:00:19.133
We'll just take a look.

12
00:00:19.133 --> 00:00:20.000
Go home, everyone

13
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.866
Your parents should be worried

14
00:00:31.266 --> 00:00:32.466
Hello mom jean

15
00:00:32.733 --> 00:00:34.900
That's good news. That's good news.

16
00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:35.733
What good news?

17
00:00:35.733 --> 00:00:36.666
Come back quickly

18
00:00:36.666 --> 00:00:39.300
You're back and I'm telling you great news

19
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.766
Okay, I'm back.

20
00:00:46.733 --> 00:00:47.533
Mom

21
00:00:48.266 --> 00:00:50.066
Jane, you are back.

22
00:00:50.066 --> 00:00:50.600
OK

23
00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.800
You said it would be great. Of course I have to come back.

24
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.566
What's the good news, mom?

25
00:00:54.866 --> 00:00:57.400
Remember when we were hunted down by your second uncle

26
00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.133
Did your dad have a comrade who saved us? Remember

27
00:01:00.133 --> 00:01:02.700
I've been looking for him. What's the news?

28
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.600
I saw him on the news today

29
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.766
He is actually the richest man in our Dragon Kingdom

30
00:01:07.766 --> 00:01:08.900
Richest man in Dragon Kingdom

31
00:01:09.166 --> 00:01:10.766
Shen Longshan is right

32
00:01:11.166 --> 00:01:15.300
I really didn't expect the richest man in the Dragon Kingdom to be so low-key

33
00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:16.666
He never shows up.

34
00:01:16.666 --> 00:01:19.900
This time it was his daughter who was kidnapped by a terrorist organization

35
00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:21.633
He's just been on TV.

36
00:01:22.066 --> 00:01:24.866
Jane, weren't you in the war department?

37
00:01:24.866 --> 00:01:28.033
Do you have any ability to help Miss Shen?

38
00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.000
Since it is our savior

39
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.133
I will do my best to repay them.

40
00:01:32.133 --> 00:01:34.600
Our mother and son belong to others

41
00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.766
You have to repay

42
00:01:36.766 --> 00:01:38.300
I went to meet the richest man in God
