1
00:00:01.866 --> 00:00:04.233
Mr. Shen, don't be torn

2
00:00:04.266 --> 00:00:06.066
Sign it

3
00:00:06.066 --> 00:00:07.766
What if I don't sign?

4
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.233
What are you doing?

5
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:13.800
Signed

6
00:00:14.666 --> 00:00:16.366
Keep Mr. Shen safe

7
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.633
If you don't sign, Mr. Shen, you will be seriously ill today

8
00:00:22.133 --> 00:00:23.700
I won't talk about it if I have more.

9
00:00:24.066 --> 00:00:25.366
Sign it and fill it out

10
00:00:25.933 --> 00:00:29.866
Second uncle, it's all your intention today, right?

11
00:00:29.866 --> 00:00:31.000
Sheryl

12
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:34.566
I am also doing this for the good of the Shen family

13
00:00:34.566 --> 00:00:39.700
Your destiny cannot afford such a heavy responsibility as the chairperson

14
00:00:39.733 --> 00:00:40.633
second uncle

15
00:00:41.566 --> 00:00:42.600
When my dad was seriously ill

16
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.900
You also promised him to assist me well

17
00:00:45.933 --> 00:00:49.200
At that time, I made a promise to your father

18
00:00:49.266 --> 00:00:51.200
Now your dad is dead

19
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.566
That promise is also torn apart

20
00:00:55.066 --> 00:00:56.633
Don't waste time.

21
00:00:56.733 --> 00:00:59.466
Mr. Shen, sign it

22
00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.366
Sign it, sign it

23
00:01:09.566 --> 00:01:10.466
Go back
