00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:02.300
What's the matter, dad?

2
00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:04.366
Really got this kid combed

3
00:00:05.066 --> 00:00:06.533
Can you save my dad?

4
00:00:06.533 --> 00:00:08.700
Yes, then hurry up and save him.

5
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.766
Didn't you believe this quack doctor just now?

6
00:00:10.766 --> 00:00:11.900
Are you still kicking me out?

7
00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:13.666
I was also temporarily deceived by the game

8
00:00:13.666 --> 00:00:15.900
Please save my dad

9
00:00:16.066 --> 00:00:17.700
Forget it, for Shen Shu's sake

10
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:19.033
I won't bother with you this time

11
00:00:19.766 --> 00:00:21.200
Dad, get the needle

12
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:22.600
Give him the needle now

13
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:23.333
Miss Shen

14
00:00:23.333 --> 00:00:25.566
Don't play with your father's life

15
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.966
You can really cure my dad

16
00:00:28.966 --> 00:00:31.066
There's nothing I can't cure right now

17
00:00:31.066 --> 00:00:32.366
Hmm, I'll let you go.

18
00:00:32.366 --> 00:00:34.366
You'll know when you kill someone.

19
00:00:34.366 --> 00:00:37.100
There is no one in the world today who can outnumber me

20
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:39.566
Just wobbly

21
00:00:39.566 --> 00:00:40.766
Disease of the patient's lungs

22
00:00:40.766 --> 00:00:42.566
You're actually distorted in your throat and in people

23
00:00:42.566 --> 00:00:43.766
Breathe him out

24
00:00:43.766 --> 00:00:45.466
Must die

25
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.066
Ahaha, what's wrong with you?

26
00:00:50.066 --> 00:00:51.200
I told you so.

27
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:52.500
must die

28
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.033
You ghost, I'll fight for you

29
00:00:56.666 --> 00:00:58.566
Don't worry, it will be there in a minute.

30
00:00:58.566 --> 00:00:59.800
Angry humph

31
00:00:59.933 --> 00:01:02.800
It's still blowing, miss, let's call the police

32
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.500
Take this Keiko hand away

33
00:01:04.666 --> 00:01:08.500
Dad helmet why do you believe you are a liar

34
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.900
He killed you, right? 123

35
00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.033
This is the Three Immortals Needle
