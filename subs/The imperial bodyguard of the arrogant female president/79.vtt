00:00:01.266 --> 00:00:03.900
Ah, why can't I stand still?

2
00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:06.600
Maybe it's been in the sack for too long.

3
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:07.333
Sour and numb

4
00:00:07.333 --> 00:00:09.200
I'll help you up and try to walk around

5
00:00:13.366 --> 00:00:16.366
No, my feet have no strength at all

6
00:00:16.466 --> 00:00:17.600
What's going on here?

7
00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:18.533
That's trouble

8
00:00:18.533 --> 00:00:19.600
What's wrong brother

9
00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.700
Do you feel dizzy?

10
00:00:21.733 --> 00:00:22.866
tailbone soreness

11
00:00:22.866 --> 00:00:23.733
Yes, brother.

12
00:00:23.733 --> 00:00:26.166
You've been stuffed in the sack for too long

13
00:00:26.166 --> 00:00:27.400
Causing a lack of oxygen to the brain

14
00:00:27.566 --> 00:00:28.366
Nerve damage

15
00:00:28.366 --> 00:00:30.200
Paralyzed the lower body

16
00:00:30.566 --> 00:00:31.800
What? Me?

17
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:32.966
I was paralyzed.

18
00:00:32.966 --> 00:00:34.800
Yes, no.

19
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.366
I was so young.

20
00:00:36.366 --> 00:00:37.833
Never been in love

21
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.700
Paralyzed, what should I do?

22
00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:41.066
If you believe me

23
00:00:41.066 --> 00:00:41.966
Follow me to my place

24
00:00:41.966 --> 00:00:42.900
I'm trying to figure out where to go

25
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:44.700
Brother, don't comfort me

26
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.366
How can paralysis be cured?

27
00:00:46.366 --> 00:00:47.600
If you believe me, believe me

28
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.400
If you don't believe me, forget it.

29
00:00:51.766 --> 00:00:53.500
Ok I believe brother

30
00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.300
Okay, then I'll take you away

31
00:01:09.566 --> 00:01:11.066
Take off your clothes and lie down

32
00:01:11.066 --> 00:01:13.400
What take off take off your clothes
