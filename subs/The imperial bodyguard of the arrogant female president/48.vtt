00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:02.833
Is this the Three Immortals Needle?

2
00:00:06.266 --> 00:00:07.166
Dad?

3
00:00:08.666 --> 00:00:09.800
I'm not dead yet.

4
00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:11.500
Uncle Shen, you have a long life

5
00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:12.333
Won't die

6
00:00:12.333 --> 00:00:13.500
I remember.

7
00:00:13.566 --> 00:00:17.900
Black and white impermanence has taken me to the underworld to meet the king of hell

8
00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:20.866
I didn't expect that the Three Immortals Needle still has inheritance

9
00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:22.766
It's a first-order universal

10
00:00:22.766 --> 00:00:24.833
You are the real doctor, aren't you?

11
00:00:25.366 --> 00:00:28.333
Didn't you say shit just now?

12
00:00:28.333 --> 00:00:30.633
Sorry for my ignorance

13
00:00:30.733 --> 00:00:31.966
Forgive my ignorance

14
00:00:32.366 --> 00:00:33.133
Uncle god

15
00:00:33.133 --> 00:00:35.200
The hospital is no longer of any help to you.

16
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.200
Let's go home and recuperate, I'll help you diagnose and treat it

17
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.800
Slow down.

18
00:00:48.166 --> 00:00:49.033
Hey who music

19
00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.900
Theological Hospital

20
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.600
If the request of the divine doctor is not good, why is there anything wrong?

21
00:00:57.933 --> 00:00:59.366
Did the three immortals really come out?

22
00:00:59.366 --> 00:01:01.233
There is a real doctor in the underworld

23
00:01:01.466 --> 00:01:02.266
God is the Lord

24
00:01:02.366 --> 00:01:05.700
If the magic of the Three Immortals is not cultivated, it will be crippled

25
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.666
Your medical ethics and qualifications are not good

26
00:01:07.666 --> 00:01:09.300
Stop being delusional

27
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:10.700
Ah!

28
00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.166
Can my father's lung cancer really be cured?

29
00:01:17.166 --> 00:01:18.400
Lung cancer is not difficult to treat

30
00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:19.866
The intractable thing is

31
00:01:20.133 --> 00:01:22.900
How can it be more difficult to treat than lung cancer?
