00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:01.133
Mr. Wu

2
00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:06.200
Who are you? Back to the leader's words

3
00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:08.100
I am the company's security captain

4
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:08.900
Please stand

5
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.333
Damn you a security captain

6
00:00:12.333 --> 00:00:15.100
Who let you go will allow it, get out

7
00:00:17.533 --> 00:00:19.400
How dare you yell at me!

8
00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.400
Why are you surprised?

9
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:23.866
Have you ever seen a security guard beat someone?

10
00:00:23.866 --> 00:00:25.466
Are you blind?

11
00:00:25.466 --> 00:00:26.866
He hit me

12
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.366
Do you want to become blind?

13
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.400
Don't move don't move don't move

14
00:00:34.933 --> 00:00:39.733
Be brave enough to be my person when you have the ability

15
00:00:39.733 --> 00:00:42.166
How about I triple your salary?

16
00:00:42.733 --> 00:00:44.700
Or you commit suicide

17
00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.133
I'll buy you a coffin

18
00:00:46.133 --> 00:00:49.966
Young people should not be ignorant of good deeds

19
00:00:50.933 --> 00:00:52.566
I'm not a drama yet

20
00:00:52.566 --> 00:00:54.700
You can do whatever you want

21
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.900
Ok, just wait.

22
00:00:59.733 --> 00:01:01.000
All heard

23
00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.500
I don't want people dying here today

24
00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.100
Let these lackeys behind you

25
00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.600
Get out of here

26
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.200
Close the door

27
00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.066
Let's have a good meeting

28
00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.666
Hurry up and get out

29
00:01:14.666 --> 00:01:16.166
Go out go out

30
00:01:21.366 --> 00:01:22.166
Ooh.

31
00:01:22.533 --> 00:01:24.433
It's a damn contract

32
00:01:24.533 --> 00:01:26.466
Isn't this a robbery?

33
00:01:28.066 --> 00:01:31.666
Hey, I have a good contract here

34
00:01:32.333 --> 00:01:34.200
Come and sign it all
