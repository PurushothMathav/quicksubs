00:00:00.533 --> 00:00:03.266
What? You're a security guard?

2
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.300
Uh, yeah.

3
00:00:05.966 --> 00:00:07.100
That's just right.

4
00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:10.166
Are you with Cher just enough to protect her?

5
00:00:10.166 --> 00:00:11.566
But nothing.

6
00:00:11.566 --> 00:00:14.766
But this is the promise I made with your dad back then

7
00:00:14.766 --> 00:00:16.300
If you go back on it

8
00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:18.033
As if I hadn't saved you

9
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.366
Okay, then listen to Uncle Shen's arrangement

10
00:00:20.666 --> 00:00:22.166
There you go.

11
00:00:22.166 --> 00:00:24.866
I will arrange for you to meet Xuerou immediately.

12
00:00:29.466 --> 00:00:32.566
What? You asked me to marry him?

13
00:00:32.733 --> 00:00:35.533
Yeah, this is my love letter to you back then

14
00:00:35.533 --> 00:00:37.400
It was arranged for marriage

15
00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:40.666
No, I am the richest daughter of the Dragon Kingdom

16
00:00:40.666 --> 00:00:42.000
President of Longshan Group

17
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.666
The first beautiful woman in Haicheng

18
00:00:43.666 --> 00:00:46.066
I married a security guard

19
00:00:46.066 --> 00:00:48.966
What face will I use to meet people in the future?

20
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.533
Shut up, who made you hate so much?

21
00:00:51.533 --> 00:00:52.666
What happened to the security guard?

22
00:00:52.666 --> 00:00:55.733
Security can protect your life, can't you?

23
00:00:55.733 --> 00:00:57.400
Do I need his protection?

24
00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.233
You're sacrificing me, not protecting me

25
00:01:00.266 --> 00:01:01.500
outrageous

26
00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.300
Do you still have my father in your eyes?

27
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.266
Forget it, God said don't be angry.

28
00:01:05.266 --> 00:01:07.133
Since he doesn't want to

29
00:01:07.133 --> 00:01:08.866
I can voluntarily give up this engagement

30
00:01:08.866 --> 00:01:11.733
No, this is the promise my dad and I made back then

31
00:01:11.733 --> 00:01:14.000
It's more about my relationship with your father.

32
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.766
If this doesn't happen

33
00:01:15.766 --> 00:01:17.500
Will be the regret of my life

34
00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.000
Then you can marry him yourself.

35
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.466
Don't count on me.

36
00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:24.700
Hey

37
00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:27.100
His mother left early

38
00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:30.333
I've spoiled him since I was a kid

39
00:01:30.333 --> 00:01:31.133
Uncle Shen

40
00:01:31.133 --> 00:01:34.700
In fact, I'm fine, and I don't really want to talk about love

41
00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.400
Since he doesn't want to, don't force him.

42
00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:38.833
Hey, can't you?

43
00:01:38.866 --> 00:01:40.866
If I can't achieve this

44
00:01:40.866 --> 00:01:43.000
I can't explain it to your dad

45
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.066
Why don't you feel wronged first?

46
00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.166
Uncle Shen, what do you want me to do?

47
00:01:48.166 --> 00:01:51.633
You, go be Xuerou's bodyguard first

48
00:01:51.666 --> 00:01:54.400
How about developing a relationship slowly?
