00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:04.940
Fear.

2
00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:07.500
What's wrong?

3
00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:10.340
Come and sit down.

4
00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.880
You speak strangely, the voice on this script is unknown.

5
00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:19.180
Even the records of Queen Vinh in the history books are extremely raw materials.

6
00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.760
Are you saying he's not the only one of the Five Immortals?

7
00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:24.200
Why is there nothing?

8
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.100
The historian's words are not all true history.

9
00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.040
I see you all day inside and outside the theater in front of the Great Dance.

10
00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:35.260
You're just a little bit haunted, so you know a lot about the inside, right?

11
00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.100
Waiting to know

12
00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.380
Of course.

13
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.740
Well said, obviously giving you a little surprise.

14
00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.040
The reason why the water plant sent to is not fragrant.

15
00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.840
That's because the fifth ordered Queen Vinh to wipe out everything.

16
00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:51.060
Deliberate order

17
00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:53.580
Why?

18
00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.780
She's a wonderful woman.

19
00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.060
The previous leader was that person.

20
00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:12.840
Where is the report to Your Majesty?

21
00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.320
She is the daughter of Prime Minister Dung.

22
00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.140
It is the princess that His Majesty personally chose for you.

23
00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:19.820
So that's it.
