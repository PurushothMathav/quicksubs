00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:03.940
Oh.

2
00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:06.140
It's time.

3
00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:08.300
Director Chen, why can't they even come?

4
00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:10.600
It's almost there.

5
00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:12.640
Anyway, two people whose names are unknown.

6
00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:15.340
You have to say good things behind the scenes.

7
00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:19.280
I heard that this time Tran, the director of the main character, chose to cooperate with Luong Gia Dai without conflict.

8
00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:21.680
If not in the back, there is a support group.

9
00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:23.420
It's been eaten and dried.

10
00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:28.360
Hey.

11
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.760
Sister, why didn't he come?

12
00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:33.780
Did the lady who played big cards especially not come to the press conference?

13
00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:35.640
This person is human.

14
00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.220
Just doing a play is cheating.

15
00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.060
Later in the entertainment world do not know what will happen.

16
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.700
Tran Tinh Ngoc, I see why this actress has not come yet. How should you get to this press conference?

17
00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:48.200
Dare to oppose my kingdom.

18
00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:49.580
This is your transonic tree.

19
00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:52.580
Let's let our reporters do it.

20
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.340
Sister, wait for what you are not in a hurry, quickly take the puppy Qin.

21
00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:02.500
Tran Tinh Ngoc, I want to see how you sing this monologue later.

22
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:09.800
Okay, I know.

23
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:10.860
You go down first.

24
00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:17.260
Excuse me, Tran Dai.

25
00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:18.560
I've heard.

26
00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.200
You're making this play, it costs a lot of money.

27
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.040
After killing all of yesterday, I held this new press conference immediately.

28
00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.840
But what about this situation at the scene?

29
00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.580
The lead actress didn't seem to want to communicate with us.

30
00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:36.160
Can I consider the behavior of the lead actress not to come to the press conference as playing the big brother?

31
00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.920
Right?

32
00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:37.720
Everybody.

33
00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.760
Ladies and gentlemen, where is our mistress Van Cam?

34
00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:42.760
High fever before the press conference

35
00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:44.280
Being treated at the hospital

36
00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.380
Now, on your way here, please understand.

37
00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:51.520
But according to our current people,

38
00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.600
Today he saw the shadow of Su Ngam Cam in front of your film crew's hotel.

39
00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:56.740
How do you explain that?

40
00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:59.600
It turns out that this guy showed up at the hotel.

41
00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.120
That means he doesn't want to go to the scene.

42
00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:07.480
The title of tomorrow is already there, and it is the female lead of the Great Five Emperors who does not want to go to the scene.

43
00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:10.100
Send this trust configuration immediately

44
00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:11.860
Sensitive headlines should be mine.

45
00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.140
I brought this up, we've fermented ourselves enough.
