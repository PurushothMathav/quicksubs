00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.440
Qin Tu, are you tired of living?

2
00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:06.120
Cuu Long Van Van Van throne is the great money of the Five Emperors.

3
00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.540
Moreover, it is the priceless treasure that our missing Liang gave to the White Prince.

4
00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:13.800
Representing the White Prince over ten thousand people all over the world

5
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.240
What are you a psychopath running for?

6
00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:17.880
The world except me.

7
00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.560
Who dares to pretend to be the whole world?

8
00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:21.940
Over 10,000 people

9
00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.460
I don't know life and death.

10
00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.680
This Kowloon Van Van Van throne is still the highest position of this banquet hall.

11
00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:31.800
Look at the whole East Sea.

12
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:32.780
Even cactus.

13
00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.400
It's not that White Prince isn't rich, it's not that they're all monsters.

14
00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.380
No more than a thousand people can do it.

15
00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:42.540
Get out! Get out!

16
00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:43.560
Come down.

17
00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:44.900
Presumptuous.

18
00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.160
I stand at the top of the golden mountain

19
00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.960
Beneath you is the capital.

20
00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.080
It's the governor general.

21
00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:51.040
It's a powerful field.

22
00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:52.340
It's a national messenger.

23
00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:53.920
And there's no official.

24
00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:54.840
2 Untalented

25
00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.060
How dare you stand in front of me?

26
00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.460
Seeing your face is a great honor.

27
00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.700
Not on your knees yet, Shane.

28
00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:04.360
It's done.

29
00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.100
He's going to start turning into an idiot.

30
00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:10.520
You are guilty of this act of the entire East Sea peak of nobility.

31
00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.220
You're in big trouble.

32
00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:18.360
Tonight.

33
00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.380
Even if you now sit down from the Kowloon Van Van Van

34
00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:23.740
Tonight will be the day to die.

35
00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.200
Also sitting for you symbolizes status

36
00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.740
On the dragon seat of wealth

37
00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:30.700
Stealing into White Prince's large position.

38
00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:35.240
Wage Shortage

39
00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:36.280
What are you doing?

40
00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.500
Jixiang, unclaw your dog for me.

41
00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.920
It's done.

42
00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.700
This is really a broken head.

43
00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:52.800
That's handsome.

44
00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:54.820
Dragon cloaks handed down thousands of years ago

45
00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.900
It's designed specifically for your flag.

46
00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.640
Arrogant in front of everyone.

47
00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.800
I am the Oath of the Five Emperors.

48
00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.560
You do not dare to easily ascend the throne of the Nine Dragon Van Van.

49
00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.260
Wearing the ancient dragon robe of the First Emperor of Heaven

50
00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:08.480
What the hell are you?

51
00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:09.700
Get the fuck down.

52
00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:23.040
Fat burning

53
00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.940
This is my own dragon robe.

54
00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.480
Why Be Bold

55
00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.420
The monster tonight.

56
00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.900
First you are the concubine sitting on the throne of Cuu Long Van Van.

57
00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:34.320
I have no regrets today.

58
00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:35.640
Combustion of Grease Jacket

59
00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.640
Both of these represent the top.

60
00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:38.900
Interpreter Warranty

61
00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:42.680
I want to give you a big gift tonight, you are a stray dog.

62
00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.140
You can overthrow men in public.

63
00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.160
He broke his arms and legs.

64
00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:49.180
Tran Giang

65
00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.260
Stop! Who dares?
