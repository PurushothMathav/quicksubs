00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.280
The watch lacks a total of 3 pieces of 26 rings.

2
00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:24.300
Okay, ha, ha, ha.

3
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:26.740
That's bad.

4
00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.880
Sure, even Western Liang snacks with only two brushes are all your fault.

5
00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.520
What is this bastard shooting at compared to others?

6
00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.340
Yes, the horse has been returned.

7
00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:38.660
It is still returned a little compared to the previous level.

8
00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:40.120
Dear, you are wonderful.

9
00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.840
That piece of shit must be so scary that he peed his pants.

10
00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.800
The boy saw what the gold content of the national champion was.

11
00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.560
Wife, I advise you.

12
00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:52.040
Or admit defeat early?

13
00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.260
Save a Generous Smile

14
00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:04.440
Hahahahahahaha you see how this little boy even if the bow strings are pulled off can be compared to the young master.

15
00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:05.920
Garbage is trash.

16
00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.800
Life can't be a climate.

17
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.360
What a clown.

18
00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:11.360
You're cowards.

19
00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:13.120
You're obviously touching the girl's hands and feet.

20
00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:14.080
Shut up, bitch.

21
00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:15.200
Is this your place to talk?

22
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.080
Now the results are clear.

23
00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:18.760
Don't bother me here.

24
00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:21.080
A million soldiers, if I remember correctly.

25
00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.600
Is this archery area your family's name?

26
00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.840
Deliberately giving up on my people.

27
00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.360
You really think I'm a bully, don't you?

28
00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.680
You can't really say that.

29
00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.720
You have no reason to say that I've done my hands and feet on the sword.

30
00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.340
Do you have any proof?

31
00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.360
Your friend what you waiting for

32
00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.080
Let's see what Qin George does.

33
00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:42.520
I saw he was ready to surrender.

34
00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.660
Millions of owners quickly declare the result of victory.

35
00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:47.920
Who said I would lose?

36
00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:49.280
Do you want to cheat publicly?

37
00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.740
Or do you want to use this bow against the young master?

38
00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:56.100
Why not?

39
00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.740
10 And all the arrows are solemn.

40
00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.320
Tonight, three swords totaling 30 are still skills.

41
00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:10.120
What?

42
00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:12.360
Return it at any time.

43
00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.200
Xiao Zhang, you must have counted wrong.

44
00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:15.480
Quickly count.

45
00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.400
Did we just look at the flower eyes?

46
00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:22.840
This was a virtual sword that had been lost for hundreds of years, setting up a kind of supreme trick that could stand alone in the world.

47
00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.140
How could it reappear on the Qin Tu?
