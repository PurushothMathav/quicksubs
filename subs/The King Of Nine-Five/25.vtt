1
00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.940
The Governor wants the bank.

2
00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:03.860
It's easy.

3
00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.360
Okay, because you really want to go your own way.

4
00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:10.000
So I'm going to give you a chance to prove yourself.

5
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.920
Prepare the archery site.

6
00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:13.160
If you win or lose

7
00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:16.300
Gotta bet on something.

8
00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.560
What compares the bow first, then compares the number of arrows?

9
00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:19.560
If you lose...

10
00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.460
Kneel down for me, meekly knock the three heads, and give me the number one of the Five Great Heavenly Emperors.

11
00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:24.660
It's done.

12
00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:25.880
Tough people want to be brave.

13
00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:27.500
He obviously doesn't know anything.

14
00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:31.400
Qin Xiao, don't let him pretend that he deliberately provokes you to want to sign a contract with a handsome man.

15
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:34.020
Look, even women know you can't.

16
00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:35.840
You have the guts to fight the young master.

17
00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.580
As long as you lose.

18
00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.740
Give up the position of No. 1 male, and the young master will excuse you from kneeling.

19
00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:42.940
If

20
00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.120
Give Ben a few words and get on his knees.

21
00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:47.900
One word.

22
00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.680
Khanh Hieu, you are the only male master appointed by the White Prince.

23
00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:53.920
If you withdraw because of this

24
00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.640
This white prince once the responsibility is down

25
00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.920
You will have no place in the entire Dragon Kingdom.

26
00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:58.720
It's okay.

27
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:00.900
We distinguish ourselves.

28
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.240
Failing, are you still human?

29
00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:05.900
I almost killed the white man because of you.

30
00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.280
Alive sold for 300 million high price.

31
00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:10.580
You're not grateful.

32
00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.460
Still believe that.

33
00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:14.180
Betting contract

34
00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:16.020
He was blind at first.

35
00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.780
Choose you this avenging white-eyed wolf

36
00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.220
In your eyes

37
00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.280
I just can't stand it.

38
00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.160
If not the couple's sister gives you a chance

39
00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.800
A loser like you.

40
00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.760
He's not even qualified to talk to me.

41
00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:29.820
Okay.

42
00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.220
Today I'm going to show you what the words of a real emperor are.

43
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.140
Put on my shoes.
