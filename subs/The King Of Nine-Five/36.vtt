00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:08.760
You come home from school and you stare at me like you're about to become the best actor ever.

2
00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:09.780
No kidding.

3
00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:14.300
What you are deciding to do, you must always give your best.

4
00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:19.100
What is the company looking for you today?

5
00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:25.180
He didn't say anything, which meant don't disappoint his and the director's expectations for me, let me behave.

6
00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:29.580
Try early so that the previously not strong elegant demeanor meets the divine again.

7
00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:35.860
I really don't know what's good about you, whether it's Chen Dao or White Prince.

8
00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:38.460
I don't know why.

9
00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:43.900
This White Prince has always given me a kind of familiar feeling that I can't explain.

10
00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.580
If anything happens, I, you mean you used to be Prince White.

11
00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:51.820
Not just smart.

12
00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:56.980
It was like a reunion after a long period of separation after being together all day and night.

13
00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:03.500
Why are you crying with that look?

14
00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:05.940
So you two are...

15
00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:07.940
That relationship.

16
00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:09.640
What relationship?

17
00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.140
That's what you used to say.

18
00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:13.620
Good color

19
00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:15.980
It doesn't make sense.

20
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.740
Before, though, it was flying.

21
00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:20.780
But there was good fruit, good strength, and left a gift for the Great Sage.

22
00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.340
Can you defame yourself again at will?

23
00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:26.480
He was angry when he finished.

24
00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:27.960
I should be kidding.

25
00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.580
So if you don't tell me the story of your love and the Queen's deception.

26
00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.500
Women shouldn't, you know.

27
00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:44.060
I've changed from Shanghai to the great general manager.

28
00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:45.820
The talent of a product.
