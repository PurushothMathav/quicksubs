1
00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:02.200
Both.

2
00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:03.840
What else do you say now?

3
00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.160
It's impossible. It's impossible.

4
00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:07.520
You must not be a cowboy.

5
00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:10.340
He couldn't have such good skills.

6
00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:12.280
I lost. I lost.

7
00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:13.500
Conquer defeat

8
00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:16.320
Thank you, Mr. Qin, for your mercy.

9
00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.760
Spare my life, you piece of shit, you're here to talk.

10
00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:19.920
Blaming you is useless.

11
00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.380
spoiling the big taboo of underpay

12
00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:25.100
If you don't quit

13
00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:26.800
I want you to be a teacher.

14
00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.000
From there, tea poured a thousand horse chase.

15
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.620
Just find out the true meaning of your sword.

16
00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:33.440
What are you doing?

17
00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:34.740
Who told you to get down on your knees?

18
00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.920
Now, make your posture flammable.

19
00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:40.100
Hot temper

20
00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.700
Let's go back and study the song today.

21
00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:44.600
Come back in three years.

22
00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.900
It's Mr. Jinzun's church.

23
00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.040
This dinosaur just returned it to me.

24
00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.980
Come back here.

25
00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.360
Two high and low.

26
00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:53.560
The defeat was divided.

27
00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:55.400
The Road Wages are lacking

28
00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.080
You can't lose.

29
00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:00.160
Don't be excessive.

30
00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:01.960
Even if you know these two.

31
00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:05.580
Also a homeless dog with no power.

32
00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.480
That's not what you just said.

33
00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:09.260
Why can't you eat?

34
00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.920
Qin Xiao

35
00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:13.620
How about you win?

36
00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.060
The young master does not respect the Single Japanese, what can you do to me?

37
00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.280
Mori, you are in every way provocative.

38
00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:20.480
Fighting everywhere.

39
00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:23.320
Do you really think that the food in the East Sea can be unfathomable?

40
00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:25.520
What is the good point of Tran Tinh Tan Xiao?

41
00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.240
You couldn't fight me five times in a row.

42
00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.640
Maybe give me white bones.

43
00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.080
The illusion deceives me all

44
00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:31.520
Bay Liang, tell me clearly.

45
00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.220
Who grew up pretending to be White

46
00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.160
Dead with a hard mouth.

47
00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:38.060
When I warned Prince White, you didn't run.

48
00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.320
Run, this idiot is crazy.

49
00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.580
Psychiatric patients

50
00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.840
Hello friend, you dare to hit me in public

51
00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.460
Get everyone here.

52
00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.260
Let's make them vulgar today.

53
00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:54.940
Let's see who dares to move.
