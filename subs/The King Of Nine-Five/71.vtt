00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:06.840
The main actor.

2
00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:08.320
It's been more than half an hour.

3
00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:09.840
The female lead was late.

4
00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.060
We'll wait here.

5
00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:12.560
No one's come here to explain.

6
00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:15.940
I've never attended such an outrageous press conference.

7
00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:17.760
Who says it's not?

8
00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:18.880
If you don't want to open

9
00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:20.520
Why a press conference?

10
00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.360
That's right, don't you think this is a waste of everyone's time?

11
00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:23.880
Let's go.

12
00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.380
Go away.

13
00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.540
Refer a friend.

14
00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:28.880
Please wait a moment.

15
00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.240
The rest of our creative team will be coming soon.

16
00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:32.500
It's coming soon.

17
00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.860
General Director Chen, your lying mouth is really harmful in itself.

18
00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:38.560
Go to that restaurant for lunch.

19
00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:41.420
People who serve also know how to urge, urge.

20
00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:47.600
Okay, look at Director Chen's face.

21
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.340
I'll give you three more minutes.

22
00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:53.860
If after 3 minutes, Qin Xiao and Su Van Cam still haven't arrived.

23
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.460
Then I'll automatically consider them small plans.

24
00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.040
Then they'll be blocked by the entire industry.

25
00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:00.760
The film could not come out at that time.

26
00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:01.720
Don't blame us.

27
00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:03.000
That's right, that's right.

28
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.780
Today, we all listen to Wang Shao.

29
00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.580
If they haven't come by then, don't blame us for being careless.

30
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.420
What's going on?

31
00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:15.860
Where are you?

32
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.780
That's not me.

33
00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.820
I told you, this Qin Xiao is not reliable.

34
00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.520
You must persist in using it.

35
00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:23.780
You see now crashed the building like that.

36
00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:25.340
This is not the time to complain.

37
00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:26.340
Go find someone.

38
00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.120
Director Chen, these three minutes are coming, I'll see.

39
00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:35.480
Qin Xiao must not be able to come here, so we will do business right?

40
00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:37.100
Business, people.

41
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.740
Who says we can't come?
