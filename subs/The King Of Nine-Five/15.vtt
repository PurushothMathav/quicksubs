00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:03.240
I want to torture you slowly tonight.

2
00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.220
It s a pity that Prince White has come, only relying on you now wearing the dragon robe and sitting on the dragon seat.

3
00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:10.660
Soon your fate will be extremely tragic.

4
00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.320
With me here, I'll go back with you.

5
00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:16.060
Please tell me what to do?

6
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:17.560
The White Company is coming.

7
00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.180
Why did you die?

8
00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:20.920
Thai mountains on top

9
00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:22.220
Face does not change color

10
00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:24.560
What's that?

11
00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.580
I believe he will have the power to turn the tide.

12
00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:29.780
Spiral Qianlong

13
00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:31.700
Tighten up the dragon seat

14
00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.180
You really see him as a huge amount of money.

15
00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:36.660
Money's been dead for 1,000 years.

16
00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:41.840
Or do you think White Prince will leave this ant-like commodity waiting for me?

17
00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.640
Tonight, I trust Prince White to have such a heart.

18
00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.580
He can do that with the talent of God.

19
00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:49.540
Is it possible

20
00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.260
Hahaha, director Chen Dai, are you infected with this mental illness?

21
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.220
It is near Chu Jia Chi.

22
00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:58.840
If he is capable.

23
00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:02.360
How can the hundred billion assets of the Qin family fall into our hands?

24
00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:06.780
The woman he couldn't ask for, how could she be under my pants every night guilty?

25
00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.320
Tran Tinh Ngoc, don't be weird.

26
00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.940
Since he sat in the dragon seat I gave it to Prince White.

27
00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.620
The consequences of today you should think about.

28
00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.880
This is the end of you being guilty of your crime.

29
00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.260
You must be trampled under my feet in this life.

30
00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.380
The one who makes you unable to turn over forever is Yang Dang.

31
00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:45.780
Stand up.

32
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.060
It's too similar.

33
00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:55.380
It's exactly the same as when you were alive.
