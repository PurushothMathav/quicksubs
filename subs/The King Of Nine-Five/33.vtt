00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.060
It's very simple.

2
00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:03.460
Because I'm big.

3
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.120
The truth of borrowing souls is unimaginable.

4
00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:09.800
This makes telling the truth divine.

5
00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:15.620
Oh, our family soon knew that sooner or later you'd have an unbearable day.

6
00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:19.900
Why did Prince White say that?

7
00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:23.040
Master Qin, you don't have to hide anymore.

8
00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:27.480
Our house, soon to see you pregnant, frantically eating blood vessels.

9
00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.480
He is a descendant of Emperor Wu.

10
00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:32.080
He sees me as my descendant.

11
00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:33.340
That's interesting.

12
00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.080
They can be fake.

13
00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:37.620
Where is this sword?

14
00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.160
It could be magic.

15
00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:43.740
But this swordsman couldn't learn.

16
00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.720
From your words and behavior reveals an innate motivation.

17
00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.760
This is the strongest evidence.

18
00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.060
What style is that?

19
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.420
Dragon Thien Tu.

20
00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.020
The emperor's time

21
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.700
The White Prince indeed protects the wise eye.

22
00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:02.740
The story comes now

23
00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.280
So am I hiding something?

24
00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.760
Oh, that's good.

25
00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:09.680
Everyone is his own man.

26
00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.660
We should have been honest with each other.

27
00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.300
The flower I dreamed of.

28
00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.220
Why are you here?
