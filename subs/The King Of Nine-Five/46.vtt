00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:00.880
Ah.

2
00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:05.820
Master, he wants to kill me.

3
00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:08.560
Who told you to do that?

4
00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:11.360
Chen Xiao, you have no right to change the script.

5
00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:12.600
Do you have a script in your eyes?

6
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:16.620
I just added a scene based on the original script.

7
00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:18.780
He can't help himself.

8
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.000
That's right, he obviously didn't get the play himself.

9
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.580
You're talking nonsense, he's clearly avenging himself.

10
00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.160
Husband, grab him!

11
00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:26.540
We're accusing him of attempted murder.

12
00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.580
On the contrary, I feel that Qin Xiao just performed very well, but you can t use it again.

13
00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:33.840
I think you're right.

14
00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.140
The kind of vase that can't be on the table like you is fundamentally unworthy of my role.

15
00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.560
General Director Chen, you are too blatant and bold, you are too much, right?

16
00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:42.540
You have an idea?

17
00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.760
There's an impression you kept for me, it's not your turn to talk.

18
00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:47.400
Really, you're too domineering.

19
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:48.560
You go in a hole, I'll go down.

20
00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:51.500
Okay, okay, I got it.

21
00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.060
You two conspired to deceive me, didn't you?
