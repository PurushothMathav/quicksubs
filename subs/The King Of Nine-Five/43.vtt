1
00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.160
Deputy Director of Security, evacuate.

2
00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:02.960
Leadership

3
00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:04.480
Please pay attention to the attitude.

4
00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:07.200
Anyway, Leung Shao is also our main investor.

5
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.520
Yes, it's no shortage. Is it reasonable for me to come and check the work?

6
00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:15.540
Okay, are you stiff, Master Wai?

7
00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:17.120
Let's get to the point.

8
00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:19.660
I like temperamental people like Chen Dao.

9
00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:22.360
The purpose of the young master coming here today is very simple.

10
00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:24.460
The female boss position is temporarily vacant.

11
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.140
Of course, it was headed by the person I introduced.

12
00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:28.360
Section

13
00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:32.180
Express yourself well, young master, today to help you be a woman boss.

14
00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:34.480
Husband, you put a hundred hearts.

15
00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:38.200
I promise I won't do anything.

16
00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.800
The person who chooses my master has just decided.

17
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:41.660
Just him.

18
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.300
General Director Chen, don't joke internationally.

19
00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.540
Don't move.

20
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.120
If you want to die.

21
00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.080
I don't mind.

22
00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:52.660
No, no, no, no.

23
00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.440
I didn't come looking for you today.

24
00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:55.240
Director Tran

25
00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.300
The investment contract is very clear.

26
00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.360
As an investor, I have the right to introduce actors.

27
00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:03.500
You don't want to temporarily cancel the contract, do you?

28
00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:05.400
He's not lying.

29
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.100
At the end of the river, there's this.

30
00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:09.800
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

31
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.580
Poor salary

32
00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.900
Then I'll give your men one more chance.

33
00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.180
Let Duong Dong and Van Cam take turns trying.

34
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.520
Ensure fairness and openness

35
00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:18.520
Tran Duc indeed atmosphere

36
00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:20.340
I am waiting for this word of yours.
