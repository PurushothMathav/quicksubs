00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:01.000
Rest assured.

2
00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.660
I'll answer these questions one by one for everyone in a moment.

3
00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:06.080
Now let's go to the break room to adjust.

4
00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:07.460
Thank you.

5
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:09.740
General Director Tran.

6
00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:10.900
Give me some news.

7
00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:17.820
Haven't you been contacted yet?

8
00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:19.740
Turn off the phone

9
00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.040
I don't know what the heck this guy thinks.

10
00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:24.260
Why is the phone off right now?

11
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.020
The cloud police won't just disappear.

12
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.060
He must have done something urgent.

13
00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:34.380
No matter how important he was, he couldn't suddenly disappear right now.

14
00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.140
The press conference starts in three minutes.

15
00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:39.640
After three minutes, if he doesn't show up,

16
00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.080
What do I tell the reporters?

17
00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:42.480
How do we tell those netizens?

18
00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:43.960
I have sent a message to the White House.

19
00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:44.960
Let him help me find someone.

20
00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.140
There should be results soon.

21
00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:49.100
That's all that's possible now.

22
00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.120
General Director Chen, the time for the press conference has come.

23
00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:53.740
Reporter, we're waiting.

24
00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.140
The sword hanging above can not be sent

25
00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.380
You get to the top for me first.
