00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.360
Oh, I didn't hear that wrong, did I?

2
00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:06.320
Are you looking for a psychopath to play the Great Front Lake?

3
00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:11.420
Could it be that you're treating all of us like idiots to deceive the mentally ill?

4
00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:14.320
Ms. To Van, is this your working attitude?

5
00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:17.320
Do you know how important the 5D atmosphere is?

6
00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:19.480
If you can't do this job...

7
00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:20.720
You just let it out.

8
00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:22.020
The home of those who are able.

9
00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.380
The atmosphere is not bad.

10
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:24.580
Eat it.

11
00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:28.320
It is my drama that Cuu Vu is the god of the sky.

12
00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.640
Can I become an actor?

13
00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:31.680
Can you hear me?

14
00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:34.400
I told you he was an idiot.

15
00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.020
You have a problem with my casting?

16
00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.140
After all, he's a psychopath.

17
00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:45.000
Please.

18
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:45.940
In case of emergency

19
00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.460
Come out with me.

20
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.160
Did this woman just get the money?

21
00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:58.740
You finish first.

22
00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.780
Hi, Fleur.

23
00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.580
Then let's try it.

24
00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:05.340
Change his clothes.

25
00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.860
Isn't this my life experience?

26
00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.680
Can this girl give me a incense wick?

27
00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.100
Can you turn off what's sent?

28
00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.300
Hey, as an actor, don't you know it's taboo to turn off the lights?

29
00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:48.980
Let him do what he says.

30
00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:51.460
You go out with him.

31
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.760
What? I've only got one chance.

32
00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:55.780
You got it.

33
00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.540
Don't worry, the heroine has been decided by you for a long time.

34
00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.040
Auditions are just a way of acting.

35
00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:05.280
He Tran Tinh Ngoc in the international reputation is great.

36
00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.940
You've got to give me some of the Liang nannies.

37
00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:13.040
It's okay.

38
00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:25.500
Chu Van Van Ly Old Age Chu Van Quan

39
00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:26.620
Lee Dai Nien

40
00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:28.440
I...

41
00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:30.480
ascended the throne at the age of 8.

42
00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:31.740
Ten years in power.

43
00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:33.040
Born in the North.

44
00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.140
The shock of death in Korea

45
00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:36.440
Attack the Three Hoang

46
00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:37.460
We have to build five emperors.

47
00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:40.460
General's orders

48
00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.380
Take the battle out first.

49
00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.020
Your Majesty.

50
00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:49.460
People's dynasties can't be without you.

51
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.500
Even if it was my last breath in the sky.

52
00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:55.760
Whose martial arts do you want?

53
00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.220
Your Majesty protects the country.

54
00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.860
King 4 shot

55
00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:04.460
The angel holds the door.

56
00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.220
King 4 shot

57
00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:09.820
You will follow orders.

58
00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.320
Mr. Qi, what are you doing?

59
00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:13.500
Stop it.
