00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:01.420
What the hell?

2
00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:03.080
See if you have a good meal.

3
00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:05.980
Our teachers have been waiting for you for over half an hour.

4
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.680
You should get dressed.

5
00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.000
Just made a movie.

6
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.320
I've started playing big cards, and I don't know where the international star is.

7
00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:15.040
We've got to give us a rational explanation today.

8
00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:17.020
If not, don't blame us for not talking about love.

9
00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:19.900
I'll give you an explanation.

10
00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:21.320
Wang Tuyen

11
00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:26.000
You secretly instigated Liang and Yang Dang to steal my Qin family s property.

12
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.900
Today.

13
00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:30.620
To stop the press conference.

14
00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.480
Send the kidnapper Van Province.

15
00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.180
Is there anything you want to explain to me?

16
00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.200
Who here doesn't know?

17
00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:41.660
Your outer path of the Qin family is because you are a bastard son.

18
00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:43.960
Still here framed the King.

19
00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:45.000
Pour blood.

20
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.220
It's hateful.

21
00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:47.400
Everyone has to reveal it to him.

22
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.080
Yes, this movie has been so long.

23
00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:51.440
You haven't succeeded yet.

24
00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:52.320
I think so.

25
00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.760
You're living your own dream.

26
00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.500
You're crazy to be emperor.

27
00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.820
Whether emotional intelligence is crazy or not, I know better than anyone.

28
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.940
Whether you were stupid or not, I don't know.

29
00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.480
Being played by a scum amid applause

30
00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:04.860
The people themselves are proud.

31
00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.080
What a bunch of idiots.

32
00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.260
The Clown

33
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.620
Wang Xun, you want me to speak in front of everyone.

34
00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.540
The heir to the throne is afraid of a mad man.

35
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.140
The story comes now

36
00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:19.720
I can't believe you're so helpless.

37
00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:20.560
Being obsessed

38
00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:21.360
Okay.

39
00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:23.860
Bring people in.
