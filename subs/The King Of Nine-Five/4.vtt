00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:08.400
Is that an exaggeration?

2
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.260
My driving skills aren't bad either.

3
00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:13.780
In fact, the five organs and six organs are like overturning the river into the sea.

4
00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:15.660
It's annoying.

5
00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:18.600
The girl

6
00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:21.500
What is this big box?

7
00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:25.320
Why is it faster than our sweaty BMW?

8
00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:26.900
Jumping out of mental illness.

9
00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:31.860
Hey, you're not Moon Moon's mental patient, are you?

10
00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:34.380
Who is a mental patient?

11
00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:37.540
Why did the girl give me

12
00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.020
Come here, you have a nose to ask me.

13
00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.060
This is the film crew.

14
00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.620
It's where I work.

15
00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.760
Forgot to pick up the actor.

16
00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:50.460
Everyone blames you for being hurt by you.

17
00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:00.320
The girl carefully burned me

18
00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:01.560
That's enough, run.

19
00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:02.700
Why are you running?

20
00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:06.980
The winner is very good.

21
00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.320
Hold the team for me.

22
00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:10.460
Okay, don't touch me.

23
00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.500
I'm the producer of this Jude.

24
00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:13.940
Dare to touch me.

25
00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:14.960
That won't let you go.

26
00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.700
The lack of salary is a big figure.

27
00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.320
Don't tell you directors anymore.

28
00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.600
Even the King of Heaven will not be able to keep you.

29
00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:24.660
Don't worry girl.

30
00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.180
I'm braver than you, and I'm incredibly strong.

31
00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.020
Liu Zhen is here, they can't hurt you.

32
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.800
Where is this man?

33
00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:33.840
Why haven't you come yet?

34
00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.820
How important is the daughter-in-law of the first five enemies that I need to remind you of?

35
00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.500
Go find me that Van Cam.

36
00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.860
The love of Ngoc billion this To Van Cam is indeed an insufficient defeat of excess.

37
00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:45.140
I'll punish him and tell him to leave.

38
00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:46.680
Director Chen is not good.

39
00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.340
Outside there's a bunch of people causing trouble at the film crew gate.

40
00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:52.460
Even standing still comes up for me.

41
00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:56.040
This boy can't pray to die tonight.

42
00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.560
Master, how do you handle this girl?

43
00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.020
This girl is very watery.

44
00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.600
Take him to my bed tonight.

45
00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:02.900
Let me choose the teacher.

46
00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:05.620
Very brave.

47
00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.960
Dare to steal women in the middle of the day.

48
00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.220
There is a kingdom in your eyes.

49
00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:12.960
King of France at synthetic people

50
00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:13.720
Death is the sky.

51
00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:14.540
Death is French.

52
00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:16.560
Pull this out for me.

53
00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.260
Pull out, I want to see.

54
00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:22.180
Who has been branded on my Tran Tinh Ngoc cast?
