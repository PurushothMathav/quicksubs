00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.120
Oh, what's wrong?

2
00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:09.900
I'm okay, I'm just rhyming kids a little afraid of the dark.

3
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.720
Why is the power suddenly out?

4
00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:13.660
Let's take a look.

5
00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:25.600
Good night the fuse again missed hitting the landlord, the second so many times he did not receive rice.

6
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.840
Don't worry, I'll be at your door tonight.

7
00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:30.980
Grandmother can sleep peacefully.

8
00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:32.080
Hey.

9
00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.200
So you can't go?

10
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.100
I alone am afraid of the dark.

11
00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.140
Never.

12
00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.460
Lonely male widow in the same room

13
00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:44.500
The Human Ethic

14
00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.160
What are you thinking?

15
00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.300
I told you to make bunk beds, not go to bed.

16
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:51.820
How old are you?

17
00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.860
You're still influenced by feudal thought.

18
00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.000
This guy can't talk, really can't talk.

19
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.820
Honestly hit a shop floor

20
00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.340
He's a piece of wood.

21
00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:28.280
But don't talk.

22
00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.240
This wood looks beautiful.

23
00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.500
No wonder the director could have glanced at him.

24
00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:45.740
If you want the benefits of clean coverage back to the top

25
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.460
I'm afraid it's not overnight.

26
00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:50.620
But to deal with the rats.

27
00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:52.180
That's enough.
