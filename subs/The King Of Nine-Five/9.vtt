00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.140
Sir, please show me your invitation.

2
00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:05.560
Invite me to hear something called

3
00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:09.280
Haha, what a shameless fool.

4
00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:11.220
I don't even know the invitation.

5
00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:12.860
Guests are like clouds tonight.

6
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.760
The more the White House emperor in his heart

7
00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:19.240
Fortunately, the young man's eyes had discovered this scourge.

8
00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:21.680
Otherwise, he would have gone mad to hurt the White Prince.

9
00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:23.380
What do you deserve?

10
00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.920
If there is no invitation

11
00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.280
I can only invite you out.

12
00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:30.100
Who says I don't have an invitation?

13
00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.300
Guests today.

14
00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.340
Who is not a famous family?

15
00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:42.740
Ants at the bottom of society like you just deserve to stand

16
00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.040
Based on what based on what based on the order of sitting today divided into three six nine categories.

17
00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:51.520
People worth 1 billion are second, people worth billions are third.

18
00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:54.460
And the person worth tens of millions will be in last place.

19
00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:57.800
The young master who can let you in is already very compassionate.

20
00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.280
And you're not grateful.

21
00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.460
You're a small manufacturer with no name, no last name.

22
00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.240
There will be no Qian Kun property, right?

23
00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:09.380
Young master, what kind of figure can stand in the front?

24
00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:12.240
At the head of course are the four big families that I Dong Hai.

25
00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.100
Of course.

26
00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.400
There is also the internationally famous Tran Tinh Ngoc.

27
00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:17.200
Director Tran Dai

28
00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.140
Wasn't this the Kowloon Van Vinh throne and my golden silk dragon robe when I was alive?

29
00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:46.820
Thousands of years don't care about honesty.

30
00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.720
I can't believe I have a chance to see you again.

31
00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.620
That's the dragon chair that Liang did not prepare for White Prince.

32
00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:55.940
What does he want?

33
00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:58.340
Smiling, what are you crazy about?

34
00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.900
The throne will give you the rubbish you dare to show

35
00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.500
Laugh, get out.

36
00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:08.180
The Nine Dragons shared the throne is a rare treasure that I gave to Prince White.

37
00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:09.780
If you look at the cave.

38
00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:11.860
It must be a dead end.

39
00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:16.420
I know.

40
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.180
Get out of here.
