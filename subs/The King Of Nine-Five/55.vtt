00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:01.820
Did you hear that?

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.780
This play of the Heavenly Emperor

3
00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:05.480
It costs 10 billion.

4
00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:08.140
Even this lead actor and actress, they're hundreds of millions of chapters.

5
00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:11.260
I think this is the biggest show of the year.

6
00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:13.320
What is the largest black horse?

7
00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:14.320
Can't you hear me?

8
00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:15.280
This play.

9
00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:17.680
They're all people who've never been in a movie before.

10
00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.000
The previous owner was still mentally ill.

11
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.180
The lady is an anonymous little producer.

12
00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.860
Such a team can't be compensated.

13
00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:26.760
What does Director Chen think?

14
00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.900
Such an important play uses two ordinary people.

15
00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:33.280
I see, it's mostly stuck by hedgehogs.

16
00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:34.780
Any, right?

17
00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.380
Oh, really, really, go away.

18
00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:43.320
Hello, Director Chen.

19
00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.800
I would like to ask you why I let you be so brave.

20
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.620
There are two ordinary people filming this top 5 inspirational movie.

21
00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:52.980
Director Chen, director Chen, are you oppressed by the capital to be able to shoot the top five inspiring films?

22
00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:56.800
General Director Chen, I heard that the main actor in this play was a mental patient.

23
00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.020
Why did you choose him as the main actor?
