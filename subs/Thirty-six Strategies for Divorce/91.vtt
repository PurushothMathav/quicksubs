00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.280
Sure enough, you are finally willing to come to see me

2
00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:09.760
Yes. Can you call me Daddy?

3
00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:12.640
No, I've given you a lot of face by coming.

4
00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:15.620
You are my biological son

5
00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.720
This is the truth

6
00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.980
I find that people like you can really comfort yourself

7
00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.380
That year

8
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.400
You don't owe mom at all

9
00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:25.340
Sure enough

10
00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.700
Dad has always been thinking of you

11
00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:30.920
Don't say that

12
00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:32.960
You and that woman never had children

13
00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:34.240
Is that the point?

14
00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:37.040
Silently, your father's critical illness has been notified

15
00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:38.240
Just these two days

16
00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:40.880
Mr. Zhao, you are responsible for chatting well

17
00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:42.460
I'm going out first

18
00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:47.700
You go out first

19
00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.140
Yes, ma'am.

20
00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:50.880
Do you still know me?

21
00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:52.000
Excuse me?

22
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.360
I've been face blind.

23
00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.060
I am Zhang Boran's mother

24
00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.260
Did you remember this time?

25
00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:59.240
Wu Ying, right?

26
00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:02.760
Attorney Tang, to be honest, I have always been grateful to you

27
00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.460
But gratefulness is gratefulness.

28
00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:06.380
I will not compromise on the rest.

29
00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.900
So? So here's 10 million dollars. Leave my son.
