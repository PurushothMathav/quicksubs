00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:00.760
Right?

2
00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:01.820
You were scolded by me

3
00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:03.900
Why are you scolding people?

4
00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:05.520
Are they customers after all?

5
00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:06.960
It's easy for me to scold him

6
00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.880
I scolded him and provided him with emotional value

7
00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.060
He also has to listen respectfully to provide emotional value

8
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.000
Don't mess with me

9
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.620
You don't understand if you say it, you are still young.

10
00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:19.020
Mr. Tang

11
00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:20.320
Tell your husband about it

12
00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.300
Many people do not prioritize problem-solving

13
00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:27.300
Always talking about how miserable I am and how difficult it is for me

14
00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:30.960
But didn't you come to the lawyer to solve the problem?

15
00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.260
You are struggling to find a lawyer

16
00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.200
Lawyers solve problems for you

17
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.260
Lawyers don't give you emotional value

18
00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:39.320
Like that woman just now

19
00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:40.600
Since he got married

20
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.580
I was beaten by my husband every now and then

21
00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:45.420
What's even worse is that his husband doesn't have a job at all

22
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.080
He is the one who earns money to support his husband and his mother-in-law

23
00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:50.860
He said he was going to get a divorce and couldn't bear to leave

24
00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:52.360
Are you angry?

25
00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:54.280
Isn't this love and murder?

26
00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.220
You're flattering him by saying that

27
00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.460
But there are quite a few of them, and I can't figure out why.

28
00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:01.100
Just like my mom

29
00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.480
My mom says every day that my dad is not human

30
00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.300
Every day screaming to kill him

31
00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:07.980
But I sent my dad to jail, right?

32
00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:09.620
He scolded me in turn

33
00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:10.780
Say I have no conscience

34
00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.040
He said my dad would wag his tail even if he had a dog

35
00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.260
And I sent my own father to prison

36
00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:16.700
Are you angry?

37
00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:19.040
Sorry for embarrassing you.

38
00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:20.580
So I can only scold

39
00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.920
I used to think I was bad

40
00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.420
Is my way wrong?

41
00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.840
But then I found that it was quite useful

42
00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.520
Because they're dealing with their stress this way.

43
00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:30.480
Perverted enough

44
00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:31.540
Right?

45
00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:34.720
The people from Tang Law Judicial Bureau are here to see you

46
00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:38.260
Why is there another person? How long has it been? I see.
