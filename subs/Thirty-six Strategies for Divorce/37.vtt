00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:01.560
Move fast enough

2
00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:03.060
Freezer speed

3
00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:05.480
If you don't move, just don't move

4
00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:08.580
If you want to make a move, the river will go against the flow of the mountains and rocks

5
00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.000
Will this work?

6
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.260
Hey, okay, let's leave it alone for now

7
00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:20.280
You have time to see the animal world

8
00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:22.580
A pack of hunting dogs surrounds a male lion

9
00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.240
You bite me

10
00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.100
It's like a tickle

11
00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.180
After a long time

12
00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.080
The lion becomes the lunch of the hunting dog

13
00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:30.940
Who called him so arrogant?

14
00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:33.080
There's nothing to blame on my head

15
00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:34.540
It's called damnation.

16
00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:36.620
Hahaha

17
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.480
Could you please do an in-depth investigation?

18
00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:40.800
He's not my client.

19
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.400
He's just my client's mother-in-law

20
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.460
He's here to make trouble, why don't you go to him and come to me?

21
00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.640
I haven't even met him, what do I call him?

22
00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.340
He's your client's mother-in-law

23
00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:54.000
So what did your client do after he got home that caused his mother-in-law to come to the law firm with a grudge?

24
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.520
If you are polite enough

25
00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.960
I'm sure the old man won't lose his temper so much.

26
00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.880
So are you saying it's my fault?

27
00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:02.180
I'm not polite enough

28
00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.680
Tang Lu, your mouth is out of the Xuancheng legal world

29
00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.640
I guess that's quite possible

30
00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.140
Oh, so you're just guessing.

31
00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:13.380
So when will our judicial department handle a case is only speculation

32
00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:14.580
Don't tell me the evidence?

33
00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:15.740
Guess yours

34
00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.340
You tang lu

35
00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:19.100
Pay attention to the tone of your voice

36
00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.540
Okay, why don't you just teach me how to be human?

37
00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.640
Tang Lu, we are here to investigate today.

38
00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.040
It is difficult for us to guide you with your attitude.

39
00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:30.460
It turns out that I have not been instructed or taught
