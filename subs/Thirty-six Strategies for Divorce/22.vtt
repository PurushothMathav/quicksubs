00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.800
He really doesn't remember me

2
00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:03.660
But can I be honest?

3
00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:05.400
Will he just kick me out?

4
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.700
No, not yet.

5
00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:11.520
Tang Lu Cuiyan hasn't been here all day today, I've been staring at it all day

6
00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:12.240
It can't be wrong.

7
00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:13.160
As you expected

8
00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:14.920
They were really at odds with each other.

9
00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:16.920
And I thought it was really sick

10
00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.240
It won't fit soon.

11
00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.760
We can talk about this anytime

12
00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:20.560
Otherwise

13
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.220
Let's get down to business first

14
00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:27.080
Good boy, play golden cicada escape with me

15
00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:28.340
I'll pick you up later.

16
00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.980
Well, thank you for your hard work, then you come in with me first.

17
00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.540
Wait a minute

18
00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:38.560
Look at me later

19
00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:39.360
Okay

20
00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:41.040
OK

21
00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:46.600
Sister Mei, I came to see you

22
00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.520
How are you? Are you feeling better?

23
00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:50.680
Much better. Thank you, Mr. Tang

24
00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.180
Xiao Zhang went to pour an apple for Sister Mei

25
00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.740
Yeah, OK.

26
00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.900
Sister Mei, if you need anything recently, just ask

27
00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.100
I can help you too

28
00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:07.500
Don't be embarrassed.

29
00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.220
We are all grasshoppers on the same rope now

30
00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:12.600
Win or lose doesn't matter

31
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.300
The important thing for us is to take good care of our bodies first

32
00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.140
So don't worry.

33
00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.480
Just stay here for a while

34
00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:21.140
Wait until your body is well

35
00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.860
I feel like I'm better

36
00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.020
It doesn't count if you say it's better

37
00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.540
Then the doctor has to say that it is better to count.

38
00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.380
Today, Mr. Cui took your medical records to my law firm

39
00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.580
I saw it and I really felt guilty

40
00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.420
It's really my fault

41
00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:41.600
He took my Bentley Dan, right?

42
00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:42.940
He didn't tell you?

43
00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:45.360
That's why he's not right.

44
00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.260
What happened to Lawyer Tang?
