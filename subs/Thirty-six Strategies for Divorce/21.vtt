1
00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:02.880
If this mediation is pointless for both parties

2
00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:05.440
Then wait for the sentencing result of the court session for a while

3
00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:06.280
Wait, Judge

4
00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:07.720
I have a few more words to say to you

5
00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:09.820
You say thank you, judge.

6
00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:14.200
Financially, we've gotten everything we deserve.

7
00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:18.580
But in fact, what my client wants more is custody of the children

8
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:19.840
The child is 16 years old

9
00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.200
On the surface, it doesn't seem to need the care of the mother

10
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.580
But the child is now in a rebellious period

11
00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:26.700
I believe you have children too

12
00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:28.620
You know how dangerous the rebellion period can be

13
00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.860
If a child has an emotional disorder because he cannot live with his mother

14
00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:34.140
Like school weariness

15
00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:35.720
What should I do if my academic performance declines?

16
00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:38.440
A man who could have been a pillar of the country became a waste

17
00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:41.160
Even what about becoming a harmful person to society?

18
00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.400
Are you sick?

19
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.780
If I take the child, it will delay his study. Don't lie.

20
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.880
Ok you go on and say thank you judge

21
00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.600
The child made it clear that he did not want to live with his father

22
00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.840
But the defense lawyer said that if the child was awarded to the father

23
00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:55.360
Can be better developed

24
00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.000
That's why people tend to award the child to the father

25
00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.200
But, Your Honor

26
00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:00.420
I want to ask you

27
00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.480
What does a person's development depend on?

28
00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.100
Because the master Roberts his son is a Yoon Junzi

29
00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:06.440
Renowned investor Johnson

30
00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:08.060
His son is a violent maniac

31
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.600
Is he short of money?

32
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.260
Does he lack opportunities for development?

33
00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.080
Okay, okay.

34
00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:13.060
Stop talking.

35
00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:14.700
Please believe in the law

36
00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.620
We don't tend to give children away to fathers.

37
00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:20.500
So let's wait for the verdict

38
00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:22.680
You are brave young man

39
00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:23.880
What's society like now?

40
00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.480
We need a lawyer like you

41
00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:26.460
Thank you, Your Honor.
