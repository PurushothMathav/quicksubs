00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.440
That's right, lawyer Tang, before things are clarified

2
00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:06.200
We decided to ask you to stop looking first.

3
00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:09.120
Stop, but I still have several cases that have not been followed up.

4
00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:10.840
Hand it over to other colleagues first

5
00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:13.020
Don't worry, we'll give you a single order.

6
00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:14.300
Not the boss

7
00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:16.780
Everything you just said is correct.

8
00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:18.140
I also agree

9
00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.600
But is there a problem with your handling?

10
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.640
You, you shouldn't have stood up for me

11
00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:24.740
Look, you've started again.

12
00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:25.780
Go away

13
00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:28.780
Tell me, I'd like to hear it

14
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.080
Boss, first of all, this matter has not been found out yet.

15
00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:35.100
Even if you find out, you shouldn't support my job.

16
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.400
I haven't even seen Wang Yimei's face these days

17
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.960
Does one of his patients suddenly commit suicide have anything to do with me?

18
00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.120
I apologize.

19
00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.520
That's just because I thought maybe something I said might affect his mood

20
00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.900
But that doesn't mean I'm the one who caused his suicide

21
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.740
How could an adult commit suicide just because of my words?

22
00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.180
That's incredible.

23
00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.920
And I know I don't have the ability

24
00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.240
If my words could kill the invisible

25
00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:58.280
Then why am I here?

26
00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:59.640
I walked into the NSA

27
00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:00.860
Grandma, look

28
00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:02.040
Floating again

29
00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:04.820
Keep talking, you two shut up.

30
00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:05.720
lie in prison

31
00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:07.920
You said you didn't go to him.

32
00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:08.800
How is that possible?

33
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.460
He is your client

34
00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:11.660
Hospital again

35
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.380
I can prove it.

36
00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:16.820
I can prove that Tang Lu has not been to the hospital

37
00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.640
Zhang Boran, you are getting bolder and bolder

38
00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.320
I didn't find it before, I thought it was a little sheep

39
00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.740
How can I prove that I have always been with Tang Lu?

40
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.180
That day and night together
