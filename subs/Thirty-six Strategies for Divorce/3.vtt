00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:04.640
Tang Lu, um, you are back. There is a problem with your logic.

2
00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:06.680
I'm not late. That's not what I meant

3
00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:08.420
The client has been waiting for a long time

4
00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:10.200
It's his business that he came early

5
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.220
What does it have to do with me?

6
00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:12.680
Besides, the contract was not signed

7
00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:14.220
He's a potential customer at best

8
00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:15.340
Where did you get the commission?

9
00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.000
He said except for you

10
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.140
He's not looking for anyone.

11
00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.820
Who is it? You'll know it when you go there.

12
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:22.460
Make a fool of yourself

13
00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:25.480
Liang Kexin

14
00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:28.640
What's wrong with me?

15
00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:30.660
Sorry I can't take your case

16
00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:31.720
What do you mean?

17
00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:32.920
I haven't said a word yet.

18
00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:33.900
There you go.

19
00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:35.840
Tell me why.

20
00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.480
Because I have accepted Cui Yan's wife's commission agreement

21
00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:39.920
I'm a vacant lawyer now

22
00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:41.720
What's so fast?

23
00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:44.020
I recommend Kirin Law Firm on the 21st floor to you.

24
00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:47.680
Looking at the entire Xuancheng, only Kirin Law Firm can compete with our plan

25
00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:48.580
Good luck!

26
00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.460
Did Cui Yan find you?

27
00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:52.780
How did he guess?

28
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.960
Excuse me?

29
00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:54.860
It is inconvenient to disclose

30
00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:00.260
It seems I guessed it right, I knew it was he who broke the news about us to his wife

31
00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:01.980
So it is.

32
00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.380
Thieves catch thieves

33
00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:07.380
You, a well-known female star, are already involved in other people's marriages

34
00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:09.560
How do you make so much sense?

35
00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:10.360
Humph

36
00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:11.700
Sorry.

37
00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:14.220
It's not convenient for me to disclose

38
00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:24.240
Ouch, Lawyer Tang has caught you. What's the matter? I'll give you 4 people.

39
00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.100
Hey, let's talk about it first, you have to give me face no matter what

40
00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:30.700
Hello Lawyer Tang

41
00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:31.820
How are you
