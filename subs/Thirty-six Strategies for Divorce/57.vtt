00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.160
What would you like to eat?

2
00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:02.120
I'll take you out to dinner.

3
00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:03.820
I don't eat with liars

4
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.220
Who are you talking about?

5
00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.140
I thought it was you

6
00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:10.080
What are you looking at? Look at your feet.

7
00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.500
Lame for a while, not lame for a while

8
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.240
Limp or not, it doesn't depend on the condition, it just depends on the mood.

9
00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.620
I should have invited you to dinner and apologized to you

10
00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:19.600
Apologize, forget about eating

11
00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:20.880
How can you buy me dinner?

12
00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.080
I have a rich friend who often gives me money to spend

13
00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:24.120
Don't worry about that.

14
00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:25.420
You are taken care of

15
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.260
Why are there so many mouths?

16
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.140
You won't let go

17
00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:32.280
This time you apologize to me

18
00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:37.600
What apology do you have? If you have it, you have it, if you don't ask it, you can't ask it, you can't hurt my pride.

19
00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.660
Where did you get your pride from?

20
00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.200
You're wrong again.

21
00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:42.400
I'm not a kid

22
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:43.740
Not a kid yet

23
00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.020
Look at the people in the street, who is as out of tune as you?

24
00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:49.700
You're learning fast

25
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.660
Please, you rude master

26
00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:52.800
It's hard not to want to be happy

27
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:53.600
Really not ashamed

28
00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:56.520
Tang law

29
00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:59.620
Xiaotong is really you

30
00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.840
I thought I read it wrong. Why are you here?

31
00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:03.200
I also want to ask you

32
00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.140
I heard you quit your job.
