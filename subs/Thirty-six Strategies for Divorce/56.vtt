00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.040
Mr. Tang

2
00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:02.400
Who is this kid?

3
00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:04.360
Could it be your new apprentice?

4
00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:06.580
Yes, it's your junior brother

5
00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.180
Call senior brother

6
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.640
Tang Jin is too much, you are content

7
00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:15.220
I haven't asked him to call you Second Senior Brother yet

8
00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:18.960
Never mind.

9
00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:21.400
No matter how high the martial arts are, I am afraid of kitchen knives

10
00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.880
I'm a fool if I don't have any eyesight

11
00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.020
Okay, you Tang Jian

12
00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.860
I'm wondering if you don't like me anyway

13
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.620
I used to like small ones.

14
00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:34.580
Hey, I found out why you like to reverse black and white so much?

15
00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.380
It's obviously you who are spending time outside

16
00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.100
And how young is he?

17
00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:43.300
Okay, remember to invite me to dinner when you have time. It's almost enough.

18
00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:44.780
Keep me clean

19
00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:45.980
Excuse me, cover people.

20
00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.980
In fact, I just came here to apply if I could bake something and take it back.

21
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.940
No, boss means good

22
00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.260
OK, I'll go first then.

23
00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:58.840
But Lawyer Tang

24
00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.680
There are some things I still want to ask you in person, which is more convenient.

25
00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.520
It's okay. You can call me anytime.

26
00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:07.180
Really? Then thank Lawyer Tang, cousin.

27
00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.660
You are blatantly against the law firm in front of me, right? I have always been an upright person

28
00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.280
I asked him to call me. Why?

29
00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.040
Even if I'm not representing him

30
00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:17.660
I'm just his friend

31
00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:18.960
Can't you make a phone call?

32
00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.120
Can't you help me?

33
00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:21.280
Is there a problem?

34
00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.100
It doesn't matter, what if you think there is a problem?

35
00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.380
You can still go to the boss to complain.

36
00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:27.940
I don't mind

37
00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:29.620
You are awesome
