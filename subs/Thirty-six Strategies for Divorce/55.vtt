00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.040
Cousin, don't put a shit basin on my head

2
00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:04.460
I'm your boss

3
00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:06.340
What can you get in my way?

4
00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:07.880
It's okay, get out

5
00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:09.180
Don't affect my office

6
00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:11.920
Director Guy, I haven't said anything yet

7
00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:13.980
Just say I put shit on your head

8
00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:16.560
Do you feel guilty?

9
00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.460
I understand what's going on

10
00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.120
Lawyer Tang, I support you

11
00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:22.920
I said why do you keep getting me to change other lawyers?

12
00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.080
You are the leader, right?

13
00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.480
Okay, I'll put it out there today

14
00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:29.120
I'm not looking for anyone but Lawyer Tang on this case

15
00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:31.160
Why are you acting like your mother-in-law?

16
00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:34.300
It's not that the family doesn't go into the same business

17
00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:35.760
Who do you like to find?

18
00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.420
We have no shortage of you in Kinmen.

19
00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.120
What did the boss say today?

20
00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.540
The owner must have forgotten

21
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.320
He said we lawyers must be compassionate

22
00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.420
Heart of Wisdom

23
00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.940
Where has your kindness and wisdom gone?

24
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.180
Usually the clients come to us because they are cornered

25
00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.340
That's how perfunctory you are to drive people away

26
00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:55.420
Lawyer Tang, I love listening to you.

27
00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:56.940
It's so busy

28
00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:59.840
What are you doing here?

29
00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:01.020
Come to announce the good news

30
00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:03.540
Are you angry with me on purpose?

31
00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.120
I'm almost a matryoshka doll

32
00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:07.400
You still came to announce the good news to me

33
00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:08.200
cut

34
00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.180
Don't talk nonsense, don't say it, don't say it, you forgot

35
00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:14.840
What's that?

36
00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.120
You're about to get off work.

37
00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:18.100
I think you should treat me to dinner

38
00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:21.300
Excuse me?

39
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.380
Lawyer Tang has an appointment today
