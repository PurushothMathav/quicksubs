00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:03.620
You two know each other, that's great, sorry, Master Guy

2
00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:05.080
I don't have time to help you with the kids

3
00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:06.960
Why don't you let him go?

4
00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.880
Don't you just take care of your Tang Dynasty lawyer by bringing someone to you?

5
00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:11.420
Sorry for the inconvenience.

6
00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:13.680
Did you just graduate?

7
00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:14.600
My name is Zhang Boran

8
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:17.040
Southwest University of Political Science and Law can't be my assistant undergraduate

9
00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:18.620
I will continue to take the postgraduate entrance examination.

10
00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:19.740
Let's talk about it after passing the exam.

11
00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:21.340
Lawyer Eita

12
00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.700
Lawyer Tang, Lawyer Tang, is Lawyer Tang so awesome?

13
00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.080
Leaders have to look at his face, fight 10 lawsuits and win 9

14
00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.740
I heard you're going to be a senior partner

15
00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.400
I'm afraid it's not good for Lawyer Tang to refuse directly, right?

16
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.640
It is the meaning of the seniors. When can we enter Kinmen by relationship?

17
00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.900
He's a recent college graduate. What do I need him for?

18
00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.820
Let him make me tea and coffee, and let him drive my bag?

19
00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:47.440
Can I ask him to investigate the client's social connections and let him reflect on the material?

20
00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.160
Director Guy, my case is already giving me a headache

21
00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.800
I didn't have a manager to take care of him.

22
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.560
Hey, are you going to piss me off? What do you mean by that?

23
00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:56.840
I just raised a Bai Xiaotong, and you stuffed me with a new one.

24
00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:58.700
Hey, why don't you give me a training class?

25
00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:00.740
Otherwise, I will not go to court in the future

26
00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.040
I specialize in logistics

27
00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:03.820
Can I be your mother?
