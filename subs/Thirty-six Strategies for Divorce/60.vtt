00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.740
Can I still see you years ago? I can't come out now

2
00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:06.560
The current situation is still not to meet.

3
00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:12.220
What if you can't leave? I'm not there yet. Don't say such depressing words, but am I worried about you?

4
00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:17.060
I know you worry about me.

5
00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:19.360
Don't worry, there will be a way

6
00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:21.800
What's the blame for the probability of being nosy?

7
00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.180
I didn't expect such an accident either.

8
00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:25.660
It was simple

9
00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:27.200
As soon as the lawsuit starts

10
00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:30.540
With your influence with Tang Jian, it must be a hot search every day

11
00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.060
The unit will definitely fire me

12
00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:35.460
It's okay now

13
00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.100
Can't you just quit?

14
00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:42.040
Fool, it's as simple as you think

15
00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.200
Have you seen anyone in my position who dares to resign?

16
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.600
And it's still in this case

17
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.700
Isn't this place without three hundred taels of silver?

18
00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:52.700
I'm done investigating

19
00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.700
Silly woman, stop thinking

20
00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.140
Yeah, I got it, baby. Hang in there

21
00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:06.500
You go there first, wait for me at ease, we will meet again soon, and we will never be separated in the future.

22
00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.020
So you mean that Bai Xiaotong secretly went to Gaiyu behind my back?

23
00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.800
Yeah, but I didn't catch what they were saying at the time.

24
00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.900
But one thing I'm sure of is they're definitely not good for you

25
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.860
Then why didn't you tell me sooner? I told you earlier.

26
00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.020
Do you believe what I said?

27
00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:32.100
Maybe I'll rob myself. Why do you have so many eyes like honeycomb coal?

28
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.700
Then why do you say it now? We both live together.

29
00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:38.060
You don't believe me, who do you believe?

30
00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:39.500
Who lives with you?
