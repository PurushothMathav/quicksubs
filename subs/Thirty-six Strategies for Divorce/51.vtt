00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.780
I went to see Wang Yimei that day

2
00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:03.120
Did you find anything unusual about him?

3
00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:05.320
I found him a little anxious the other day.

4
00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:07.240
But it's normal when talking to other people

5
00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:09.400
I didn't find anything. What did you tell him?

6
00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:11.360
Did you tell him as I told you?

7
00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:13.120
Didn't say anything else superfluous?

8
00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:15.200
I promise I didn't say a word more

9
00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:16.700
That's weird.

10
00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:19.380
We saw the defense idea in Tang Jian's computer

11
00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.700
He just asked Wang Yimei to fight for something practical.

12
00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:25.220
Don't fight for an apology or something

13
00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:28.440
Then he disgraced his husband and kicked him out of Zhenggang Group

14
00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:31.900
Yes, aren't we just trying our best to meet his needs?

15
00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.340
To put it bluntly, we are not just trying to win him over

16
00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.260
Let him abandon Tang Jian for other lawyers in our green lock

17
00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:38.520
That's weird.

18
00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:39.960
There's no conflict.

19
00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.660
Even he repelled Tang Jian so much

20
00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.360
Put yourself in the hospital

21
00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:47.060
Why didn't he take advantage of such an opportunity to change lawyers directly?

22
00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:48.660
How comfortable would that be?

23
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.220
Why can't I figure it out and commit suicide? Then how do I know?

24
00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.140
I see. Tell me what's going on.

25
00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.960
Well, the only thing that could go wrong is the advice Tang Jian gave him and he took it.

26
00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.920
That is to say, Wang Yimei supported Tang Jian

27
00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.980
In this way, when we make a move, it actually makes him conflicted

28
00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:08.620
That's a contradiction.

29
00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.260
Because of this, I can't think of suicide

30
00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.460
Don't you forget.

31
00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.380
When Bai Xiaotong went to Wang Yimei, we told him to be tough

32
00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.040
The heroism of Tang Jian is serious

33
00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.960
We as a law firm will not support him at all

34
00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:24.900
And we will never compromise

35
00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.980
Just in case.

36
00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.460
I can only do one and two endlessly
