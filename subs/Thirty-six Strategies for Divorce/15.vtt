00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:03.600
Are you Lawyer Tang?

2
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:04.500
What's going on?

3
00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:07.560
Tell me, my husband raised a woman outside

4
00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:08.780
It's right next door to me.

5
00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.280
Now I even have a son

6
00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:12.840
My husband is now openly spending money on him every day

7
00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:13.920
My mother-in-law doesn't care

8
00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.940
He said he was spending money on his grandson.

9
00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:19.660
Brother, that woman just now is the right person for Tang Jian

10
00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:21.680
If you want to let it die, let it go crazy first

11
00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:23.200
We have to make him crazy first

12
00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:24.280
Let him do more

13
00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:25.720
Then you can't give it all to him.

14
00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:27.260
Leave yourself some rebellion

15
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:28.440
Am I that stupid?

16
00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:31.080
The woman just now is a relative of my classmate's house

17
00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.440
Ouch, the house is already in a mess

18
00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.200
The most important thing is that he has a particularly domineering mother-in-law

19
00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.100
I can guarantee it.

20
00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.240
Whoever takes this case is unlucky

21
00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:40.340
Don't believe it, wait and see

22
00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:45.460
This matter will become old and dry guns are still old and spicy

23
00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.080
Hahahaha

24
00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:48.660
That's it. Hmm.

25
00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.080
I can see now that this family doesn't value me at all

26
00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:54.120
I can't stay in this house for another day

27
00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.200
I want a divorce.

28
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.100
You'd better not get a divorce at the moment

29
00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.240
Why escape the room?

30
00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:01.320
Aren't you the most supportive of women getting divorced?

31
00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.980
I just took a fancy to this and came to you with all my heart

32
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.900
I just want to cut myself off

33
00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.480
Don't let yourself make mistakes again and again

34
00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:10.080
I don't know who you heard that I can only persuade people to get a divorce

35
00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:10.920
Let's not talk about that.

36
00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:11.920
Let's talk about things

37
00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.460
I have my reasons for saying I can't leave nature
