00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:04.560
Ouch, Director Guy will check it first

2
00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.640
You still have the heart to make fun of me

3
00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:08.640
I'm out of luck, can you support it?

4
00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:09.840
How can that be?

5
00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.800
Their revolutionary friendship endures forever

6
00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:13.540
As soon as it melts, it melts and loses.

7
00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:17.460
I'm here to help you. If you say less, you will help me

8
00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.480
Oops, I just poked such a big building because I said less

9
00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.040
At this time, I have already lied, so I can't rush it.

10
00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:27.880
Can you sit as soon as the boss's front foot leaves?

11
00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.060
It's going to be next month in a week

12
00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:32.040
I can only blame myself for my bad luck

13
00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.820
Who knew he would return again?

14
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.380
Hey, that Zhang Boran is very close to Tang Jian

15
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:38.800
Lao Qian, you have to be careful

16
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:44.460
I can still let that hairy boy bully you, I have already let that hairy boy bully you

17
00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:48.160
Hello, Mr. Tang

18
00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:49.500
I'm Liu Ying.

19
00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:51.420
Don't worry, speak slowly

20
00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.520
My husband suddenly refuses to admit that he is raising women outside

21
00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:57.080
And now he's accusing me of slandering him.

22
00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:01.100
But now I can't catch him, and I can't catch him anywhere

23
00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:02.580
I already thought of it

24
00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:04.340
Once a lawsuit is involved

25
00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:06.120
The human instinct is to protect ourselves

26
00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:07.800
But what should I do now?

27
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.560
You go to the law firm first and change to a first attorney

28
00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.060
Then we'll figure it out. Hmm.

29
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.520
But who should I replace?

30
00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.500
Well, Zhang Moran, that kid

31
00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.140
Will he sue?

32
00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.060
Isn't there me?

33
00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.080
Oh, I remember now.

34
00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.900
That kid is very protective of you

35
00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.700
Go ahead, that's fine, fine
