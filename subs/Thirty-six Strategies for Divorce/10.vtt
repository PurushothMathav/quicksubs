00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.580
It should be Cui Yan who was beaten by Cui Yan

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:03.680
How is that possible?

3
00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:05.160
He is a celebrity in Xuancheng

4
00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.300
That doesn't mean he's a real gentleman.

5
00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:09.740
I'll tell you what.

6
00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:11.940
Now domestic violence men are everywhere.

7
00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:13.320
And why would he do that?

8
00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.340
Well, I mean, why would he let his wife sue him?

9
00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:18.160
I don't know yet.

10
00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:21.500
But the only certainty is that there must be a giant gall hidden behind this

11
00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:26.900
Let's go, let the patient rest, it will be fine

12
00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:28.240
Ah!

13
00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:40.880
You are the only one in our law firm, right?

14
00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:43.580
It's better to put the client directly in the ICU

15
00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.280
Tang Jian, let me see how you play this time

16
00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.540
The director is not there yet. Can you be afraid of me? What do you mean?

17
00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.520
Why don't I expect you to recover?

18
00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.140
Okay, okay, I'm thinking about hospitalization first

19
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.740
I really don't blame Lawyer Tang for this.

20
00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:57.720
Yes

21
00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:59.720
Tell me about it.

22
00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:00.880
Who is not bad for Tang Jian?

23
00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:03.720
Is it my fault? It's my director who didn't take you well, right?

24
00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:05.960
Director, it's not a big deal

25
00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:07.780
It's like you're going to make headlines

26
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.800
What do you mean it's not much?

27
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.780
How big is big in your eyes

28
00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.540
You're a lawyer?

29
00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.620
You have to think about everything you say and do.

30
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.440
You don't understand that the difference is a thousand miles lost, right?

31
00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:20.120
Anyway, I have already reported this to the boss.

32
00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:21.640
I can't stay if anything happens

33
00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:22.860
Can you read it, director?

34
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.120
The owner is not good.

35
00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:27.540
Cuiyan, he's here, no matter how cheap he is

36
00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:30.060
Are you going too far?
