00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:06.380
It's you. I'm looking for Director Guy

2
00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:09.260
I'm not looking for you, Lawyer Tang, I know

3
00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.520
But Director Guy is gone now

4
00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:14.220
You don't know anyone else except me now

5
00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:15.760
Hey, do you want me to introduce you to a few?

6
00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:17.100
What kind do you want?

7
00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.160
Do you want to be obedient, gentle or refreshing?

8
00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.260
No need.

9
00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:23.380
I'm leaving now wait

10
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:26.680
There are some things I didn't want to say

11
00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:28.740
You see this and that day by day

12
00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.000
Are you finished picking and picking?

13
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:31.840
I suggest it.

14
00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:33.620
You go straight to a psychiatrist

15
00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:34.880
Anyway, you have money

16
00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:36.280
You can pay him to complain

17
00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.080
There's a comfortable chair to lie on

18
00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:39.340
Lawyer Tang?

19
00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:41.640
I really want a divorce

20
00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.440
Whether you want a divorce or not is your business.

21
00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.000
No one else can help you make up your mind

22
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.440
But you come and go like this every day

23
00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:48.920
It's not your own time that you're wasting.

24
00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.220
It's lawyer time

25
00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:52.500
I know I know ok

26
00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:54.080
You can go back and continue to think about it.

27
00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:56.000
Oh, Lawyer Tang?

28
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.040
Long time no see.

29
00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:58.600
I noticed that you have changed a lot

30
00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.600
What has changed?

31
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.040
Isn't Lawyer Tang always talking a lot?

32
00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:04.940
No. What is it?

33
00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:06.960
I don't know.

34
00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:07.900
just

35
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.000
You don't seem to be the same as before

36
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.900
Okay, let's go back quickly, so as not to delay you from finding a lawyer.

37
00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:16.740
What's going on?

38
00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.140
Why is it like a mouse met a cat?
