00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:01.620
What is this?

2
00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:04.320
Someone is going to be promoted to senior partner wow

3
00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:05.200
So envious

4
00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:06.760
Everyone be quiet

5
00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:09.840
What we have here is a nominal questionnaire.

6
00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.200
The new senior partner of our law firm will be announced soon

7
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.780
This vote in our hands is very crucial

8
00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.980
Everyone must take it seriously

9
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.860
Bet on the person you think is most deserving

10
00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.000
3 candidates can only vote for one

11
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.080
Anyway, we're here to make up the denominator

12
00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:27.700
Sweet? Who do you choose?

13
00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:31.340
Everyone stop licking

14
00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:32.560
I have a question for you.

15
00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:34.360
What's an intern doing?

16
00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:36.760
I remember that lawyer Tang Jian's name should be on the list

17
00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:38.700
There's no mistake here.

18
00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.760
Let's not stop making mistakes.

19
00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.280
Listen to you or listen to me

20
00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:43.280
Who listens to whom?

21
00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.760
You, an intern, are not even eligible to vote

22
00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:47.800
Do you understand the rules?

23
00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:48.720
We are a law firm

24
00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:50.200
It's the most disciplined place

25
00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:51.380
So ask

26
00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:54.880
What is the problem with lawyer Tang Jian that does not appear on this list?

27
00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.600
Don't bring this up until it's explained clearly

28
00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:58.400
Ha ha.

29
00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:00.380
I've seen it

30
00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.680
It is rumored on the Internet that the post-00 generation will rectify the workplace

31
00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:04.180
That's how it was rectified

32
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:06.120
But can I explain it to you?

33
00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:07.540
I demand an explanation

34
00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.000
Afterlife is scary.

35
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.660
Amazing young people
