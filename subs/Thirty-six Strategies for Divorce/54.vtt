00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.760
I said lawyer Zhao, I don't want lawyer Lan

2
00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:03.680
I only want lawyer Tang

3
00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:05.720
Why are you so funny?

4
00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:07.480
Aren't all lawyers the same?

5
00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:08.800
Your case is not complicated

6
00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.280
I've heard it all

7
00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:11.940
Lawyer Tang did not make a mistake at all

8
00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:14.420
It's your own people who won't let Lawyer Tang go to work

9
00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:16.080
The police didn't say anything

10
00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.220
Why are you investigating him? What's the use of telling me this?

11
00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.200
Liu Ying, why are you here?

12
00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.700
Why are you here?

13
00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:29.800
Net mess me up

14
00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.340
I just finished my interview.

15
00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:32.800
Come and say hello and leave

16
00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.840
Don't worry, it won't delay your promotion and fortune.

17
00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.220
It's not what you say

18
00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:37.920
It seems like what have I done to you?

19
00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.240
Attorney Tang, I was looking for you

20
00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:40.600
I heard you were suspended

21
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:41.940
Just because of a dead person

22
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.620
Never mind. I will be back in a few days. But I can't wait!

23
00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:47.180
You can change your lawyer

24
00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.760
Every lawyer in Kinmen is amazing

25
00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:51.060
Are very responsible

26
00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:53.360
Don't worry, but I only trust you.

27
00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.500
Lawyer Tang, you are so right

28
00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:58.280
I now dare to ask my husband how much he earns a month

29
00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:59.520
How dare I ask before?

30
00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.580
I'm afraid he won't give me money if he's angry.

31
00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.760
You also said that if it weren't for your mother-in-law making trouble

32
00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:06.380
How could Lawyer Tang let you talk to me?

33
00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.560
It's not that you made it clear what happened to my mother-in-law

34
00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.460
You actually don't know what Zhang Boran picked

35
00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:14.220
Still think the door is not messy enough?

36
00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.740
Director Guy, I remember I told you

37
00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.820
My client is very strict

38
00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:20.440
It's not in litigation yet.

39
00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:21.720
He definitely won't say it

40
00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.740
But his mother-in-law can say my name with precision

41
00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:26.500
What's going on?
