00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.260
Thank you for your cooperation.

2
00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:08.900
What are you in a hurry

3
00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:12.520
Can you not worry if you leave? What do they want to do?

4
00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:15.440
Therefore, I tell you that you must study hard

5
00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:20.080
Many things can't be learned, and they don't end well. Just like me, I was checked for three days and two days.

6
00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:21.200
Don't kid me.

7
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.500
You are not in a hurry. What's the use of being in a hurry?

8
00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.800
Oh, by the way, how's it going with Liu Ying?

9
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.320
According to what you said, the driving recorder has been changed.

10
00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.880
Doesn't her husband suspect it?

11
00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.740
No, I asked Liu Ying to drive and rub it before changing it.

12
00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:34.440
Yo, you're smart.

13
00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.540
Otherwise, what should I do if I get fired by you?

14
00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:39.480
Now I think the oil cavity slipped off.

15
00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.040
By the way, why not install a positioning system directly? Installing a positioning system is illegal for evidence collection.

16
00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.940
But we installed a dashcam with a GPS system

17
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.420
That's different.

18
00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.520
There is a positioning system in the driving recorder

19
00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:52.540
Then what?

20
00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:53.860
Otherwise, why change it?

21
00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.940
Ah you old fox

22
00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:58.280
I'm getting old now, right?

23
00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:59.640
I was wrong, wife.

24
00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.120
Who is your wife?

25
00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.080
When you catch someone, don't let him go up by himself.

26
00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.080
Remember to call 110

27
00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.280
Yes, otherwise it's illegal.

28
00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.540
And the police report is more convincing

29
00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:17.840
Ah, are you Ms. Tang?

30
00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.620
Ah, it's me, your courier.

31
00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.560
I don't come into the office anymore, I can still catch up with this hum

32
00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.080
Hey don't move

33
00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.980
You forgot what happened at your door before.
