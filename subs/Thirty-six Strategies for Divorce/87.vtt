00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:03.160
An animal's brain has a path-dependent setting

2
00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:06.220
Once he attacks a human and gets food

3
00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:08.640
This path is set up in the brain

4
00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:12.980
In the future, whenever they encounter hunger, they will instinctively use this way to forage

5
00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:15.780
So ah, this animal is dangerous

6
00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:16.720
Can't keep him

7
00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:18.680
You mean Bai Xiaotong

8
00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:20.440
In fact, people

9
00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:21.880
It's the same as animals

10
00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:25.800
It's like cheating only 0 times and countless times

11
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.120
Gamblers should continue to gamble even if they lose their money

12
00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:32.760
Once a path is formed in the brain, it can never be erased

13
00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:34.300
What if he really changes

14
00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:37.880
It can't be said that a person who makes a mistake will never be forgiven

15
00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:39.240
If he does change

16
00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:41.640
Even in a coffee shop, he can live well

17
00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.160
Besides, shouldn't these consequences be borne by him?

18
00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:46.260
You're right

19
00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.460
I know you can't see women suffer and always want to help them

20
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.980
If you take a case, you won't take it if it's not a woman

21
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.680
I advise you that there must be something hateful about poor people

22
00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.340
Some people are not something we can help

23
00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.780
Don't embarrass yourself anymore

24
00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.340
I see, thank you

25
00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.140
Liu Yunan is still adjusting tomorrow. Can you stop playing and rest early?

26
00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:12.940
Are you sure you want me to play?

27
00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:15.160
Sooner or later you have to stand alone

28
00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:17.740
I play games because I'm nervous

29
00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.000
Don't try to lie to me

30
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.300
Are you nervous? You are just playful

31
00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.460
Why are you not nervous when you see you contradicting the rain?

32
00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.400
I'm wrong wife

33
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.620
I won't be playful anymore, you still play

34
00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:35.320
Sleep
