1
00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.300
You do what I say

2
00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:05.400
Attitude must be decided

3
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.620
Don't be soft-hearted just because your husband said a few nice things.

4
00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:10.360
Otherwise Buddha can't help you

5
00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:11.180
first

6
00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:17.020
First, get back all the money and things your husband gave to that woman, but all the things he gave away.

7
00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:19.820
How can we get it back? These are handled by our lawyers.

8
00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.060
You just have to persevere.

9
00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:24.340
As long as I can get it back, I will not default.

10
00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:25.560
Not necessarily.

11
00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.040
Then what do you say?

12
00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:32.000
First of all, you sue that woman for violating social order and morals

13
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.540
You don't need your husband's consent.

14
00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:35.140
Then apply for an investigation order

15
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.680
Take out your husband's assets and find out

16
00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.120
But my husband would never allow me to do that.

17
00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:41.560
I just said it in vain, didn't I?

18
00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:44.640
Teacher, my husband volunteered to give him flowers.

19
00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.640
What can I do if I find out?

20
00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:51.320
Your husband is disposing of your marital property without your consent

21
00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.220
This is not legally recognized

22
00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.560
Your husband's gifts are all invalid. It's not Lawyer Tang. Don't be angry.

23
00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:00.100
I'm just afraid that my husband won't cooperate with me.

24
00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:02.180
As long as you are not happy

25
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.620
You can be as tall as your husband

26
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.540
I don't understand why you women cry and make trouble and hang yourself when you encounter problems

27
00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.140
Don't know how to solve the problem at all

28
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.840
But don't but

29
00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:13.320
After you get your money back

30
00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.540
Your husband will love you to the death

31
00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:16.940
Lawsuits won or not won

32
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.140
Not all lawyers

33
00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:19.820
It's about you.
