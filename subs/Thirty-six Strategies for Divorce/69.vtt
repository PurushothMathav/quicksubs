00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:02.240
I just finished being interviewed by the police

2
00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:05.720
I didn't expect you to come again. As an individual, I will definitely not embarrass Lawyer Tang

3
00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:07.480
But the work to be done we have to do

4
00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:09.080
We and the police are two different systems

5
00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:10.920
Things are different

6
00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.080
Of course I know this

7
00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:14.160
Lawyers are inherently sensitive

8
00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.420
I also feel sorry for Lawyer Tang

9
00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.220
How should I understand your words?

10
00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:21.400
It means you've found some more evidence against me

11
00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:22.500
Lawyer Tang is smart

12
00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.020
Forensics across two unrelated systems

13
00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:26.540
Isn't it easy?

14
00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:27.760
Who looks up to me so much?

15
00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:30.920
Don't ask if you spend so much effort torturing this lawyer Tang

16
00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:34.040
Anyway, we have a material in our hands

17
00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:37.240
It was found by the police when they inspected Wang Yi's possessions

18
00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:39.160
It's a letter he left before he committed suicide

19
00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:45.000
The letter made it clear that his illness might be admitted to a lunatic asylum for systemic treatment

20
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.420
And? And he was scared.

21
00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.280
We just can't figure out who told him these things

22
00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.540
So ask Lawyer Tang

23
00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:55.820
Where is Tang Lu?

24
00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:56.880
In the interview room

25
00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:58.620
The Justice Bureau is here again

26
00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:01.140
I said it.

27
00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:02.200
I also told the police

28
00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:06.940
But that doesn't mean my words caused him to want to kill himself

29
00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.360
In fact, he can completely trust me

30
00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.800
I also told him to tell me everything

31
00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.920
Then we discussed together what to do next

32
00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.140
And I also allowed enough time for him to calm down

33
00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.520
But I didn't expect him to commit suicide

34
00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.420
Therefore, Tang Lu believes that he is not responsible

35
00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:25.420
Not some, but not all.

36
00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.080
You go back and study this

37
00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.900
Then you can revoke my lawyer's license
