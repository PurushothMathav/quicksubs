00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:03.900
What rich man?

2
00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:06.060
Eat this junk food every day

3
00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:11.740
Hello Barrister Xiao

4
00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:13.500
You want to poach me again?

5
00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:14.700
Mr. Tang

6
00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:17.800
I heard today that a dark horse rushed out of Jingmen

7
00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.600
Your boss officially hired you after less than a month of internship

8
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:22.780
I don't know.

9
00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:26.140
Who is it? Isn't it your little boyfriend?

10
00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:27.700
What nonsense?

11
00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.340
He is my apprentice

12
00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:31.280
Okay, stop pretending

13
00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:32.740
When did I pack it for you?

14
00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.560
Tell me how you developed it

15
00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:38.680
Please come to our unicorn training and training when you have time.

16
00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:40.200
They are not dark horses

17
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.560
He's a donkey at best.

18
00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:44.920
You see, this is clearly the tone of teaching your boyfriend a lesson

19
00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:45.920
Still don't admit

20
00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:46.740
Xiao Jingyi

21
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:48.840
Do you want to be on my blacklist?

22
00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.340
Hey no no no

23
00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.220
Did I check your USB stick?

24
00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:54.320
I guess you forgot.

25
00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:55.480
What's on the USB stick?

26
00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:57.040
Are you going to see it now?

27
00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:58.000
Call me when you're done

28
00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.940
Well, okay, I'll go see it now.

29
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.320
He looked a little anxious.

30
00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.020
But it's normal to talk to people

31
00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:09.780
I can't see anything.

32
00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:14.560
How did the soldier find it?

33
00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.000
The two of them often meet there

34
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.460
I often smoke over there.

35
00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.300
Did you find anything strange about Wang Yimei when you went to see him that day?

36
00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.040
How can you thank me?

37
00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:34.700
Lawyer Tang, I will immediately appoint you as the head of the inner circle. Okay, Eunuch Xiao, I will hang up first. Hey

38
00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.920
I rely on, don't worry, don't worry

39
00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.060
Let me think about it.
