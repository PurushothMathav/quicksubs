00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:10.780
Men don't have a good thing

2
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:11.940
Pull up your pants and run

3
00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:16.660
Ah, honey.

4
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.020
Yeah, you're awake.

5
00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.900
I was about to call you to breakfast

6
00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:22.480
You eat first

7
00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.040
I'll be there in a while. Can't you eat?

8
00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:25.920
I'll wait for you and we'll eat together.

9
00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.740
Trouble right

10
00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:30.580
This is your new underwear

11
00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:32.300
Try it on.

12
00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.960
Can you buy underwear casually?

13
00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:37.300
What if it doesn't fit?

14
00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:38.540
Why doesn't it fit?

15
00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:40.500
How long have we been together?

16
00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:43.920
I knew you were late before I met you. How did you know?

17
00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.140
Did you forget the photo on the previous wall?

18
00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:52.260
Please, there is still a big gap between the photo and the real thing, you don't understand, right?

19
00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.800
There are references in the photo.

20
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.580
Your height and weight can be calculated according to the reference object.

21
00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.260
Add the size and model of your coat to calculate the size of your underwear.

22
00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.380
You should stop being a lawyer and become a police officer

23
00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.860
I became a lawyer because of you, again

24
00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:12.200
The moment you convinced the judge

25
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.860
I think you are like light

26
00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:15.060
Very important

27
00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:17.700
There are so many people walking around, I only see you in my eyes

28
00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.560
So I made a wish to be with you

29
00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:22.820
Yeah, you should stop being a cop.

30
00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:24.820
Go write a novel
