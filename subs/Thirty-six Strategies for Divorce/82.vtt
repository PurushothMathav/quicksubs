00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.500
Don't be impulsive later

2
00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:03.580
Otherwise it will be stopped again. It's not right

3
00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:07.680
Even the boss said that you have a heroic plot of bravery and courage

4
00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.760
Why are you afraid of this now? It depends on who is right

5
00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:10.760
I don't care

6
00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:11.660
You can't

7
00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:13.900
I'm worried that something happened to you

8
00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.540
Can you stop doing this and always move me

9
00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:20.780
Then you marry me

10
00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:22.500
You can toss with me

11
00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:23.540
What happened

12
00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:24.740
Husband saved you

13
00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.180
You can say it again. What's wrong with my husband?

14
00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.540
But you can leave this matter alone, you don't know

15
00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:35.820
Wang Yimei's death hit me hard

16
00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.860
I feel I am responsible

17
00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:40.100
So I want to do something

18
00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.380
It's a comfort to your conscience, don't blame yourself

19
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:45.720
You didn't do anything wrong

20
00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:47.620
We're doing this for his own good

21
00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.440
He's just like your mother and the woman who was abused

22
00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:51.800
He can't make up his mind in life

23
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.420
Is it a relief for him to die?

24
00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.160
So don't blame yourself all the time

25
00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.020
Think about it, what do I think

26
00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.140
You have to catch up with your pace when you grow up

27
00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.620
Can't always leave you so alone

28
00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.500
I heard you made a big discovery, yes
