00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:02.940
Wang Jin, are you going too far?

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.640
Mr. Cui, calm down

3
00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:05.640
Don't know him in general

4
00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.400
Come and go Mr. Cui

5
00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.040
It's not all lawyer Tang's fault

6
00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:10.180
I am also responsible

7
00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:11.480
Seen clip clip

8
00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:12.660
I've never seen a scissor

9
00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.120
Cui always has something to say to me

10
00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:18.780
We agreed before

11
00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:20.640
My wife is not well

12
00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.000
Hope not to disturb

13
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.380
You put him in intensive care?

14
00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:27.740
Please explain to Mr. Cui, Mr. Tang's lawyer

15
00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.160
I'm so sorry.

16
00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.040
No, I didn't expect it.

17
00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:32.500
But things are things

18
00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.060
I apologize because you two are still husband and wife

19
00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.400
Not because I was wrong

20
00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:40.360
On the contrary, Mr. Cui, it is very strange that you are here today

21
00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:41.920
Neither reasonable nor reasonable

22
00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.100
What did Lawyer Tang say?

23
00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.760
Mr. Cui as your wife's attorney

24
00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:47.840
I have a right to know

25
00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.040
Right to inquire right to defense

26
00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:51.860
I have the right to ask him something

27
00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:54.000
It is his right whether your wife answers or not.

28
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.840
It's my right to ask or not

29
00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:57.040
How did you get to Mr. Cui?

30
00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:58.720
I lost my basic rights as a lawyer

31
00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:00.520
But we agreed before

32
00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.400
Don't ask my wife without authorization

33
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:03.800
My agreement was not signed with you

34
00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.060
Do you understand the law?

35
00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.240
From now on

36
00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.040
I hope Mr. Cui doesn't show up here again

37
00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.180
Because you are the defendant

38
00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.560
And I'm a defense lawyer

39
00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.020
Lawyer Pang Pang, are you going too far?

40
00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.360
Mr. Cui, you see that Tang Lu is still young

41
00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.760
Don't meet him unexpectedly

42
00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:20.980
I thought I would still have some face in Xuancheng

43
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.260
Unexpectedly, Cui is always a person who only cares about face

44
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:26.600
Tang Jie

45
00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:28.660
you

46
00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:31.580
Hey Mr. Chen

47
00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.060
Tang Jie, you are deliberately angry with me, right?

48
00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:36.620
I specially
