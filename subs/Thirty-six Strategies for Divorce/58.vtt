00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:05.940
I don't want to do it anymore, I also want to say if I am implicated

2
00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:07.220
Sorry.

3
00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:08.820
Of course not because of you.

4
00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.100
It's because of my own business

5
00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:12.700
Believing people who shouldn't

6
00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:14.120
What do you mean?

7
00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:15.260
It means nothing

8
00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:16.540
Don't think about it.

9
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.760
In fact, I have learned a lot in the two years I have worked with you

10
00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:26.420
So thank you from the bottom of my heart why do I think you don't want to leave at all?

11
00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.100
Do you want to think about it again?

12
00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:29.880
Golden Gate is really a nice place

13
00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.220
Treat newcomers fairly

14
00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:33.580
As long as you are willing to work, you can get results

15
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.680
I can get promoted to senior partner at my age

16
00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:37.340
You don't get that anywhere else.

17
00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:39.300
I know all this

18
00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:40.980
Thank you, Mr. Tang

19
00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.740
Sister Xiaotong, I haven't had the milk tea you bought last time.

20
00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:47.440
You have the nerve to say

21
00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:49.900
You are a newcomer and have no eyesight at all

22
00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:53.100
Goodbye donkey

23
00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:54.340
Goodbye Xiao Zhang

24
00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:56.660
By the way, donkey

25
00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.900
Well, just looking at you, I thought of a word

26
00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:02.740
What happiness?

27
00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.900
Happiness

28
00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:06.660
Yeah, it's fine.

29
00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.540
Don't you think he's acting weird today?

30
00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:12.780
I don't think so.

31
00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.700
Why are you so stupid about this?

32
00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.580
Oh, I just remembered something to tell you.

33
00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:19.700
So what's up?
