1
00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.980
He said he likes me.

2
00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:04.980
Borrowing a luxury car to pick up girls?

3
00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:06.740
Just like you, you still go to graduate school

4
00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:09.160
Don't think about it, stay for a few days and get out

5
00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:10.860
Kinmen won't keep people like you

6
00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:14.300
Hey what are you doing

7
00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:16.540
I'll do it myself, don't move

8
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.940
I'll bake it for you

9
00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:25.060
Tang Green just had something in his hair

10
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:26.940
Tang Green be careful

11
00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:33.900
No, what does he, a little kid who just graduated, like about me?

12
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.300
I tried so hard I could be his mother

13
00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:40.740
I don't practice

14
00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:45.700
No, he must be famous in his bedroom

15
00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:47.640
A great name

16
00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.120
So I studied hard for the college entrance examination. Three months ago, I was angry and went to Southwest University of Political Science and Law from the literature entrance examination

17
00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.480
Now I have the courage to stand in front of you

18
00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:55.300
Forget it, Tang

19
00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:58.060
It's like being eaten by a dog

20
00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.920
Tang Lu has finally found you. What's the matter?

21
00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:04.000
Someone's coming up

22
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Said to find you

23
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.560
Why are you looking for me? I don't know

24
00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.840
I see you are Tang Zai

25
00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.000
Lawyers are two

26
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.460
We are from the Judicial Bureau

27
00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:15.500
Bring the materials

28
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.380
Well, here's your research data.

29
00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.660
I was reported for abetting the client to disrupt public order less

30
00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:23.860
That's not a small charge

31
00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:25.860
To revoke a lawyer's license

32
00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:27.600
And I'll never be a lawyer

33
00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.480
Don't you understand?

34
00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:30.800
Why were you confused at that time?

35
00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.160
Being a lawyer is risky

36
00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.360
Your words and deeds will have a serious impact on the parties involved

37
00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:36.560
You are a lawyer

38
00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.040
Don't talk nonsense

39
00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.140
What did I say?

40
00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.860
Why am I called a party disturbing public order?

41
00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:43.680
What's written on this?

42
00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:44.680
Please show evidence

43
00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:45.720
Don't worry.

44
00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.200
We are here to investigate today.

45
00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.320
If implemented

46
00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:50.880
I'm not the one sitting here talking to you today

47
00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.740
Good investigation, right? Just ask
