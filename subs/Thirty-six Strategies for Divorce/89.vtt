00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:05.240
Boss, you can give this quota to someone else.

2
00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:06.480
I don't want why

3
00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.440
Do you dislike me? You shouldn't be eyeing my position, right?

4
00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:10.740
How is it possible boss

5
00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:11.920
Just kidding again

6
00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:13.480
You are kidding me

7
00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:15.480
Tell me what you think.

8
00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.000
I just think I'm too young now.

9
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:18.880
Not qualified enough

10
00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:20.260
Scared me to death

11
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.460
I thought you were mad at me for what happened before

12
00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:24.740
How is that possible?

13
00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:26.160
I forgot.

14
00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.200
Forget it

15
00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.600
Let's talk about it

16
00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.360
I think your qualifications are sufficient

17
00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:34.020
Over the years, you have been dedicated and your performance has always been the first

18
00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:38.420
I'm sorry I didn't give you this spot. You are the boss.

19
00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.120
I still want to stay in my current position for a few more years

20
00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.100
I'm going to be a senior partner now

21
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.280
To be distracted by many things

22
00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.160
My experience I can't handle

23
00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:47.240
I don't want to deal with it either

24
00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:51.260
And you might as well let me do some practical work in a down-to-earth manner

25
00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:52.360
Ask the boss to fulfill

26
00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:53.480
This is troublesome

27
00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:54.760
Who should it be given to?

28
00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:55.560
By the way, Xiaoxia

29
00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.640
Look at who is higher in this comprehensive evaluation score?

30
00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:03.220
Well, in addition to the sugar rate, the lake rate has the highest score, so give Hu medicine, thank you boss

31
00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:05.380
Wait. Hmm.

32
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.940
What's the matter, boss, is there anything else, Xiaoxia?

33
00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:10.060
You go first

34
00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:13.220
Are you in love with Xiao Zhang?

35
00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:15.220
OK

36
00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.780
What's the matter, Xiao Zhang, this guy has a good personality

37
00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.080
The quality is even worse. To be honest, I like it too.

38
00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.720
But aren't you a little too young? You fight divorce cases every day now.

39
00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:28.280
You know this better than me

40
00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:29.420
Boss, I understand

41
00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:31.460
Do you think he dares?

42
00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.180
I didn't say

43
00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:34.860
I didn't say anything.

44
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.100
I'm going out, boss
