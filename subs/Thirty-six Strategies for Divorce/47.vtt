00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:04.360
Boss, aren't you abroad?

2
00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:05.240
Why are you back?

3
00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:09.140
You also said that you would never come back, your grandmonkey will be turned against the sky

4
00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:10.780
What? Boss?

5
00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:12.220
You should say

6
00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:13.660
You tell me.

7
00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:16.560
I said Wang Yimei committed suicide by jumping off a building

8
00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.420
Wang Yimei committed suicide by jumping off a building

9
00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.340
How is that possible?

10
00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:21.720
Why is that?

11
00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.160
As for why, you still don't know?

12
00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:25.600
Cui Yan suspects it is not suicide

13
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.120
Ask the police to open a case for investigation

14
00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:28.920
You cooperate well with the police investigation

15
00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.140
After all, he is your client

16
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:32.620
I got it, boss.

17
00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:34.100
I'm responsible for this.

18
00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.080
I will fully cooperate with the investigation

19
00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:38.740
You always do things rashly

20
00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.420
It's 30 again this year

21
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.120
32 32 is not small

22
00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:45.760
Forget about other professions

23
00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:46.920
And you are a lawyer

24
00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.640
Don't tell me lawyers just fight every day

25
00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:53.060
It's cool, it's over

26
00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:54.080
As a lawyer

27
00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:55.480
You have to be kind.

28
00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:58.240
Because the benevolent have no worries and must have a wise heart

29
00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:01.480
Because wisdom is not confused, you must have a brave heart

30
00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:03.060
Because the brave are not afraid

31
00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.500
And you? What else do you have but courage?

32
00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:07.680
What about your kindness?

33
00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.680
What about wisdom? What you're playing with is not wisdom at all

34
00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.780
Smart at most

35
00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:14.880
I've always been optimistic about you

36
00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.320
You have fought countless lawsuits over the years

37
00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:18.600
Also won countless

38
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.440
I have indeed made a great contribution to the law firm

39
00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.960
But you've been doing pretty badly lately.

40
00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.600
It was desperate to find you when you saw the client

41
00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.400
Do you know how much pain they have in their hearts and what can you do for them?

42
00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.380
Do you deserve their trust in you?

43
00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:35.960
Thank you Lao Da for teaching

44
00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:37.640
Okay, let's go home.

45
00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:38.440
What!

46
00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.940
go home
