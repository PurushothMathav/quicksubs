00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:04.120
I don't know if people in the other world will be so busy

2
00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:05.540
What nonsense are you talking about?

3
00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:08.080
It's nothing, it's in Xiao Wang again, right?

4
00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:09.700
You're getting to know me better.

5
00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:11.080
It's all in the past

6
00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:12.460
As you thought

7
00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:13.980
Cui Yan did talk a lot

8
00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.580
He also received his due punishment

9
00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:18.040
So should you take it easy?

10
00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:19.040
Think about me

11
00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.980
Childish

12
00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.940
But I was wondering if Wang Yimei hadn't died

13
00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:24.700
The lawsuit will definitely be fought

14
00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.820
And then the media reported it.

15
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.800
The adultery between Cui Yan and Lan Kexin came to light

16
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.540
Create a large area of public opinion

17
00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:34.480
Then what about Zheng Gang?

18
00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.340
Cui Yan will be fired soon

19
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.060
Let him escape in vain

20
00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.140
If it weren't for Gaiyu making trouble from it

21
00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:41.600
It seems possible

22
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.640
No, no, no, I was wrong. It can't be. What does that mean?

23
00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:45.320
Because you are a very serious person

24
00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.400
You can't fight this lawsuit without knowing it

25
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.240
Before Wang Yimei's problem is clarified

26
00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:50.900
You're not going to take it easy.

27
00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:52.660
But the outcome doesn't change.

28
00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:58.740
Because my original intention was to ask Wang Yi to sue Cui Yan for possible domestic violence

29
00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:00.900
If charged with this crime

30
00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:02.920
The result is still the same

31
00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.780
Don't forget Cui Yan's transfer record to Lan Kexin

32
00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:08.100
How could you be so naive?

33
00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.300
I have already calculated that transfer record.

34
00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.060
The three years add up to less than 100,000

35
00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.660
So Cui Yan is the old fox

36
00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.580
Hello, your two cups of coffee.

37
00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:20.580
Xiaoxiaotong

38
00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.780
Lawyer Tang, how are you?

39
00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:26.900
Are you all right?

40
00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:30.100
Lawyer Tang, I'm sorry for you

41
00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:31.640
I'm regretting it now

42
00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.160
I deserve everything

43
00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:34.540
I have no face to see you
