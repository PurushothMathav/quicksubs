00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.400
Okay, you can go back first

2
00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:04.120
If there is any situation, please tell the front desk.

3
00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:04.920
Thank you Tang Lu

4
00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:06.780
Hmm Tang Lu

5
00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:08.380
Let me ask you a question.

6
00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:13.440
You just said that if he gets the money, his husband will love him to the death.

7
00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:14.440
What does that mean?

8
00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:15.900
What do you mean by this sentence?

9
00:00:16.319 --> 00:00:17.940
Suspect that I am not Tang Lu

10
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.260
You're wrong about me

11
00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:23.720
I know that in your eyes I am an old woman who has never been in love

12
00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:24.640
Know what?

13
00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:26.160
Tang Lu, don't say that

14
00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.140
You are in such a good shape and so beautiful

15
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:29.340
Where is it old?

16
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:30.420
Don't flatter

17
00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:31.980
I just think so

18
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.640
That's a little thoughtless of you.

19
00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:34.940
It's illogical

20
00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:36.220
It doesn't make sense.

21
00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:37.680
I don't understand love

22
00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.340
But I understand human nature. What do you mean?

23
00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.500
Do you think his husband really loves that woman before spending money on that woman? Otherwise?

24
00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.500
Because he bore him a son

25
00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:48.960
The idea of family succession is particularly strong

26
00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.220
Yeah, isn't that more questionable?

27
00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.060
He got the money and his husband shouldn't hate him more

28
00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.320
How can you love him so much?

29
00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:57.600
The money is in his hands

30
00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.020
His husband doesn't love him. Who does he love?

31
00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:00.260
That's human nature.

32
00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.920
So there is no love between husband and wife

33
00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:04.600
Marriage is a game

34
00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.640
Tang Lu, I don't want to fall in love even if you say so.

35
00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:08.660
That's good.

36
00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.060
In the future, I will give you a divorce relationship Tang Lu

37
00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:17.220
Don't you go to work, lad? It's been a day, aren't you tired?

38
00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.360
It's okay, the leader specially approved me to take care of you.

39
00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.660
No, I don't have to work, I don't have to take care of me, I'm not paraplegic

40
00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.500
It's my job to take care of you

41
00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:25.420
You're welcome.
