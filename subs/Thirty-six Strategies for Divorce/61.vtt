00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:03.720
Hey, don't go home, okay?

2
00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:04.940
It's not safe.

3
00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:06.760
Just buy new clothes.

4
00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:09.460
No, why don't you always respond to me?

5
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:10.880
What do you want from me?

6
00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:12.180
Indifference is response

7
00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:13.540
We're all adults.

8
00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:18.040
Do I have to pull my ears and tell you what works and what doesn't before I call it a response? There's always a reason

9
00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:18.980
I don't want to be in a relationship.

10
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.460
Why am I a divorce lawyer?

11
00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.500
I fight divorce cases every day

12
00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:25.480
How do you expect me to believe that men marry men?

13
00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.160
What's more, at your age?

14
00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.400
Your life is just beginning

15
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.660
Why should I waste my time growing up with you?

16
00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.900
Accompany you to see this world of intoxication and money

17
00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.460
And watching you fall in love with girls younger, prettier and more capable than me

18
00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.780
I'm going to watch you throw me away like trash

19
00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.700
I know you're worried. Shouldn't you be?

20
00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:49.180
Look at Liu Ying

21
00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:50.380
Look at Wang Yimei again

22
00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:52.120
Which of them was not very happy before?

23
00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.380
What are you doing now?

24
00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.580
What growing old together is bullshit

25
00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:57.800
This is love.

26
00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.020
That's marriage.

27
00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.440
That's the reality.

28
00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:01.780
What women want

29
00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:03.840
Is eternity the only

30
00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.920
Men want excitement.

31
00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.000
It's novelty.

32
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.060
These two species were never meant to be together

33
00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:13.700
But I'm not like that. There are exceptions to everything. Men are the same.

34
00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.000
Well, I don't want to talk to you about these questions in vain.

35
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:16.960
You are still young and you don't understand

36
00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:18.520
Let's just maintain a moderate relationship

37
00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.480
Women can't screw you, you always have to get married and have children

38
00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:22.720
Little Dragon Girl and Yang Guo

39
00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.100
Who told you that women must get married and have children?

40
00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:29.300
If a man can do it for you, I can consider you.

41
00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.060
Be careful, am I?

42
00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:34.040
Ok you come with me

43
00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:34.940
I'll support you

44
00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:38.860
Are you poisonous?

45
00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.220
You show me go
