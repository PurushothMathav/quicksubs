00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:02.860
Yo Barrister Tang

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.420
The two of them are quite tired and crooked. They are deliberately angry with me. Are you thinking too much?

3
00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:07.980
By the way, you came just in time.

4
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.040
I was just about to find you

5
00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:10.920
Why are you looking for me?

6
00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.460
Regret what

7
00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.040
I regret choosing the wrong person

8
00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:16.440
If only you followed me

9
00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:17.620
Flick your fingers for a moment

10
00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:19.860
I will rescue you

11
00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:22.200
Xiaojinyi, can you be a person?

12
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.760
Hey, you have no conscience.

13
00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:27.080
I just saved you, so I'm angry with you for saying this

14
00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:28.540
Then how sad am I?

15
00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:30.880
Let's get down to business. Where is Liang Kexin recently?

16
00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:35.000
How do I know where a big star is? You are the most likely to know, okay?

17
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.760
It's all over the Internet that Cui Yan broke up with him completely

18
00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.320
Must be abroad now, I seem to have heard such news

19
00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:42.500
complete break

20
00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.000
How did this come about?

21
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.960
Gossip news?

22
00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:46.080
Who knows if it is reliable or not?

23
00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:47.960
Nine times out of ten it's fake.

24
00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.400
Anyway, things on the Internet can't be trusted

25
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:51.860
Whether it's true or not

26
00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.380
There must be something else behind this news

27
00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:58.540
How to say oops

28
00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.360
You two are really a couple.

29
00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.840
When asked, Yida was quite serious

30
00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.620
That's because you don't know Tang Lu well enough

31
00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.040
Now you're swearing your sovereignty over me again?

32
00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.280
You two

33
00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:10.840
You say I want to hear it

34
00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.880
During this time, Lan Kexin is not even cold in front of the media

35
00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:15.620
But there was actually gossip about two people

36
00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.140
And whether the relationship between Lan Kexin and Cui Ying is good or bad, only we know

37
00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.320
Last time, Gaiyu took it out to make trouble for me and fried the news

38
00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:25.300
But it passed quickly and no one believed it

39
00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.860
Well, don't you think it's far-fetched that this will happen again?

40
00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.360
Why am I a little confused?

41
00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:32.380
That's right.

42
00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:34.820
Little soldier, come here

43
00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:37.160
Tang Li, what's the matter with you?

44
00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.960
Hurry up and contact the two investigators who investigated Wang Yimei last time.

45
00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.700
Tell them we're making a big discovery
