00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.220
There are rumors on the Internet that Cui Yan and Lan Kexin broke up

2
00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:04.460
This is ridiculous

3
00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.080
Because entertainment gossip reporters can't pull out unfounded gossip

4
00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:12.380
This shows that someone spent a lot of money on the popularity and deliberately fried it.

5
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.280
Do you remember what Wang Yimei's appeal was?

6
00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:15.760
Make them publicly apologize

7
00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:18.540
Then ask the group to remove Cui Yan from his position

8
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:19.860
So now it seems

9
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.980
Apologizing is a lie

10
00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:24.080
Dismissal is the real purpose

11
00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:27.680
As long as the group removes the strict paper because of the lacy news

12
00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:29.780
Then he can avoid investigation

13
00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.700
Is that very likely?

14
00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:36.720
Otherwise, how could someone who cherishes his feathers like Cui Yan expose his ugliness?

15
00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:38.860
He will definitely find a way to suppress it

16
00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.860
Just because he said sorry to his wife and felt guilty

17
00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:43.900
Such self-punishment

18
00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.520
That's a stretch.

19
00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:50.920
That's right, King Guangping can judge that he has no guilt for him at all because of the torture marks on his body

20
00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:52.140
Now think about it.

21
00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:56.300
What is this Cui Yan doing when he rides his bicycle to work every day?

22
00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.000
Isn't that just doing it for others to see?

23
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.980
Yeah, so he is probably a very corrupt official.

24
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.200
What did you come up with?

25
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:05.540
I didn't expect it either.

26
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.280
But Xiao Zhang told me today

27
00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.340
He saw on the Internet that Cui Yan broke up with Lan Kexin

28
00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.840
This shows that it is no longer feasible to rely on lawsuits to stir up popularity

29
00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.000
He is in a hurry

30
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.940
So I can only rely on buying heat to fry hard

31
00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:20.960
So I figured there must be something wrong with Lancosin.

32
00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:22.280
What do you mean by this?

33
00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.020
First of all, news is for people to see

34
00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.760
Then their relationship is definitely not a break-up

35
00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:29.200
It's pretty good.

36
00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.920
So it's very likely that Lan Kexin was also pulled into the water

37
00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.040
So now this news is to deliberately distance Lan Kexin's relationship

38
00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.400
If so

39
00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.480
Can't you just check it together?

40
00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:39.380
Be fast

41
00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:41.980
I suspect that Lan Kexin has emigrated

42
00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.580
How could a popular A-list actress give up a bright future?

43
00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.020
The gossip didn't ruin her vision at all

44
00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.940
She just saved the donkey downhill
