00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:05.040
Yo Yo Yo Who is this?

2
00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:06.080
Mr. Tang

3
00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:08.020
Is it a peach blossom wind blowing today?

4
00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:09.680
You old rascal

5
00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:12.780
I have something to do with you, I know it.

6
00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:14.340
Tell me what's the matter

7
00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:16.660
In fact, what about this time?

8
00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.100
It's easy for you

9
00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:23.200
It's the kind of thing you can fix at the click of a finger

10
00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:27.420
Okay, don't give me the routine, and don't even think about giving me the good guy card.

11
00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:28.780
I need a favor

12
00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:31.120
The real ink is straight to the point

13
00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:33.260
Oops, is it about Bai Xiaotong?

14
00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.240
He's in a cafe right now, but under the circumstances, he's never going back.

15
00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:41.740
But let me tell you, he is the business I brought out by myself, and he is very diligent.

16
00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:43.960
You've picked up a big bargain

17
00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:45.140
You stop

18
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.820
Why what why

19
00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.760
Why are you so heartless?

20
00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.460
He almost got you disqualified as a lawyer

21
00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.160
Why are you still willing to help him?

22
00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.140
Then don't I think he is more pitiful?

23
00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.640
If you were the one who got there

24
00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.060
Will anyone feel sorry for you?

25
00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.740
Forget it, anyway, I've already said this, it's up to you, wait a minute

26
00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.140
I was a little too excited just now. I apologize to you, Abby

27
00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:09.720
I know you are for my own good

28
00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.240
You know it

29
00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.660
But I have to say a few more words

30
00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.040
It's not that I don't give you face, I don't want him, it's only my own reasons.

31
00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:19.280
Because he has offended you.

32
00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.920
Where did you rob it? What is it?

33
00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.880
Any animal in the zoo that eats people or kills ex-guests

34
00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:27.160
No matter how rare

35
00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:29.100
No matter what level of protected animals

36
00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.360
Even the giant panda

37
00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.340
Will be executed in secret without pollution

38
00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:33.440
And you know why?

39
00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:34.620
I didn't know that.
