00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.820
Not the boss

2
00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:07.380
This is because when I came home the other day, I found chicken blood on the door of my house

3
00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:09.500
Then there was death written on the wall

4
00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:11.260
Then I called the police

5
00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:13.660
The police told me not to go home for a few days

6
00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:15.780
On the one hand, I'm worried about my safety

7
00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:18.220
On the other hand, to protect the scene

8
00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.180
Find the person who wants to intimidate me

9
00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:23.440
That's why I went to Zhang's house.

10
00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:25.480
This is not right.

11
00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:26.280
This one.

12
00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.120
It's not that there are so many hotels to stay in

13
00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:30.620
I have to live in Xiao Zhang's house

14
00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.160
I let him live in my house

15
00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.200
I didn't ask you

16
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.500
You are a lawyer, not a police officer

17
00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.900
You are not Tang Jian's assistant yet

18
00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.820
Why did you get Tang Jian's problem?

19
00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.360
The director asked Xiao Zhang to say that I didn't let Tang Li stay in the hotel

20
00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.280
Why? Because everyone in the hotel is dirty.

21
00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.040
In order to be Tang Jian's assistant

22
00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:49.160
Do everything possible to please him

23
00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:50.040
So let him live in my house

24
00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:51.540
Therefore, the hotel is not clean

25
00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.220
So, how clean is your place?

26
00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:55.680
You may not believe it

27
00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.400
I can't say my room is clean

28
00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:58.840
Anyway, not even my mother has been there

29
00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.020
Consider being the first person to sleep at my house

30
00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.260
Hahaha what's wrong

31
00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:07.480
I misunderstood.

32
00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:09.520
Are we a little off topic?

33
00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.640
It's not off topic, are we not only on topic?

34
00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:14.340
Are they all young people?

35
00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.680
Cousin, don't be unconvinced

36
00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.360
Go home and rest for a few days

37
00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.140
Maybe you can even make a marriage

38
00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.380
Boss, come on

39
00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:27.180
Go home and think about how to be interviewed by the police
