00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:03.740
Mr. Tang

3
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.200
It's time to get off work.

4
00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:06.620
sarcastic

5
00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:07.840
Speak up

6
00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:09.940
It's rare to see Mr. Tang so unhappy

7
00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:12.540
Why is everything going wrong recently?

8
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:13.820
What's your business?

9
00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.720
Hey, what are you doing hanging around in front of me, the defendant lawyer?

10
00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:20.480
What's the matter, your green has closed down and there is no land to go.

11
00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:22.620
Okay, let's get down to business

12
00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:28.340
An Kexin is anxious. He recently asked me why it took so long, and the court didn't even have a subpoena

13
00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:29.760
No adjustment either.

14
00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:30.720
What's the situation now?

15
00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:31.620
His lawyer

16
00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.060
Strange

17
00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.860
Why do you think he is so active as a defendant?

18
00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:37.460
He is not positive

19
00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:38.820
I guess I'm flustered

20
00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:40.600
As soon as this matter came to light

21
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.580
I can't even take the show

22
00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:44.760
I can only wash my face with tears at home all day

23
00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.520
Oh, it worries me.

24
00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:47.740
What's your problem?

25
00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.680
Go and comfort him

26
00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.420
What a great opportunity. Look

27
00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:53.220
You're choreographing me again

28
00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.500
Boring hum

29
00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.900
Ah hey

30
00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:02.540
What's the hurry, let's talk for a while, I have nothing to talk about with you

31
00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:04.620
Our relationship is awkward

32
00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:05.760
Talk too much

33
00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.300
Was seen

34
00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.520
I can't afford that.

35
00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.180
This is what I want to talk to you about

36
00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:12.420
What do you mean?

37
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:13.400
Tang Jian

38
00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.480
So many years

39
00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:18.740
Although you and I are always on opposite sides of the prosecution and defense

40
00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:20.460
But it's work after all

41
00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.240
In fact, I admire you from the bottom of my heart

42
00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.480
And I've never regarded you as a real enemy

43
00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:27.660
Speak up
