00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:06.100
Say what you have

2
00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:07.940
Wasn't it fine last night?

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.580
Why do you suddenly hate me and fire me?

4
00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:12.900
No. Why?

5
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.520
Impossible, you clearly said you like me

6
00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:17.480
Say I'm tall and handsome is your type

7
00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:18.940
What were you running for this morning?

8
00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:20.340
Why am I running?

9
00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:23.260
You slept like a dead pig in the morning. I'm not running. I'm late with you.

10
00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:24.740
Then you leave that note

11
00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:26.540
Is it to piss me off?

12
00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.380
You see, this is how you young people think.

13
00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.240
How can there be so many why

14
00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:33.680
I just simply don't want to see you, understand?

15
00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:35.000
You obviously like me

16
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.280
I like your size.

17
00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:37.780
Do you think I have that kind of kung fu?

18
00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:39.360
Adults have an adult world

19
00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:40.560
What family love love

20
00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:45.280
I'm past that age. You see what you keep saying, and I only see one sentence here.

21
00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.840
You care about your age, and you care about mine.

22
00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.920
I always thought you were brave and you were a coward

23
00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.340
Tommy wow

24
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.580
Should I give you a Nobel Prize for speaking?

25
00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:56.840
Are you reading too many novels or too many short dramas?

26
00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:58.760
One dare not take one bite and one is cowardly

27
00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:00.980
Who have I, Tang Jian, been afraid of when I was so old?

28
00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:02.820
I was scared by that little brat

29
00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:04.400
narcissistic

30
00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.340
I tell you my patience has limits even though you helped me

31
00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.680
Although I do treat you better than others

32
00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:11.920
But that doesn't mean I like you

33
00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.240
But I've already kissed you, you're so shameless

34
00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:15.380
Dare to say anything

35
00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:16.800
You didn't refuse?

36
00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.220
Did I smoke yesterday? You don't call it rejection.

37
00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.300
If you really refuse, you won't let me touch you

38
00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:22.120
i

39
00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.660
I have to tell you this sentence, don't say I don't want you to let me go, um

40
00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:29.780
You bastard

41
00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.500
Tang Li has an accident

42
00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:34.780
What's wrong?
