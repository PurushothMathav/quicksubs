00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:03.840
Lawyer Tang, please go out and wait for me first

2
00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:05.740
I'm fine, I'll be waiting for you outside.

3
00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:07.340
Right at the door

4
00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:11.460
Please take a seat

5
00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:14.800
Oh, Lawyer Tang

6
00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:15.640
Didn't bother you?

7
00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:16.980
Does it work?

8
00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:20.120
In fact, I have already guessed the purpose of your visit

9
00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:21.160
Then take a guess

10
00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:23.760
It must have been implicated by Gaiyu

11
00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.080
How did Tang Lu know?

12
00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.340
After all, the first time I investigated, I did something that affected the industry

13
00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.200
But the second time, obviously not.

14
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:32.440
I can't pick it out

15
00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:35.160
I am ashamed that Gaiyu is my father's classmate

16
00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.020
So I kept letting him lead by the nose

17
00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:38.500
I'm so sorry Tang Lu

18
00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:39.620
Where is it?

19
00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:42.880
Domestic? real-world friends society is actually not a big deal

20
00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:45.120
I also know that Tang Lu is not a vengeful person

21
00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.080
That's why I came to see Lawyer Tang this time

22
00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:49.720
Gaiyu provided some information to the Judicial Bureau before

23
00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:51.120
After you provide the video

24
00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.200
We just found out that he lied

25
00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.740
It stands to reason that this has nothing to do with us

26
00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:59.040
But we almost wronged good people because of our affairs

27
00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:00.320
That's a big charge

28
00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.440
So I also asked Lawyer Tang to give me a testimony

29
00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.220
I know what to do. I know what to do.

30
00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:08.400
You are here today because you are afraid that I will fall into trouble, right?

31
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.880
I'm ashamed that Tang Luning got it right, don't worry, you two.

32
00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.220
I won't do it.

33
00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.540
Then thank Lawyer Tang

34
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.220
You're welcome. Let's go now.

35
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.880
Hey, are you alright?

36
00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:27.140
Scared me to death

37
00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:28.880
I didn't do anything wrong.

38
00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:29.980
What can I do?

39
00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:31.440
Forget it.

40
00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:32.860
I know what to do.

41
00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.220
I won't tell you what you want to do.
