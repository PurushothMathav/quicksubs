00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.160
Uncle, we have been together for so long

2
00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:04.360
I've never noticed such a dark side to you

3
00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:06.180
I just had bad luck.

4
00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.140
If there is no problem

5
00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:10.780
Sign it.

6
00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:12.560
What are you going to do with me?

7
00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:16.440
It depends on the above decision. Can I still be a lawyer?

8
00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.100
I don't know what to say.

9
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.520
I've been implicated

10
00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.800
If I hadn't reported to the leader thousands of times today

11
00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.180
I can't lose this game

12
00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:27.760
But don't get me wrong.

13
00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:30.720
I'm not leading the inquiry to go through the back door with you

14
00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.960
I just have a little hope for you

15
00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:34.440
But you let me down so much.

16
00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:35.400
I have something else to say.

17
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:36.040
Let's talk about it.

18
00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:37.100
These ideas

19
00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.820
It's all from Ma Weiyang

20
00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:46.800
If the leader has anything he wants to ask, just ask.

21
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.240
Do you know about the treatment?

22
00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:53.380
What are some things that you actively say and passively say?

23
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.240
The result is different.

24
00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:58.600
I know that you admit that the idea was yours

25
00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.460
I'm not so straightforward.

26
00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.040
Lao Qian and I have been colleagues for many years

27
00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:04.200
He tells me everything

28
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:05.800
I can't close my ears and not listen

29
00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:06.780
You're very smart.

30
00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.320
We really have no way to verify whether this has anything to do with you.

31
00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.120
But as one of the leaders of the law firm

32
00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:15.500
Failure to report is the problem

33
00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:16.660
What do you think?

34
00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:20.580
I am indeed responsible for this.
