00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.960
There's a reason he can't calm down

2
00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:03.640
A case was reported abroad

3
00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:05.440
A rich man has a lover outside

4
00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:07.280
Then he started to dislike his wife constantly

5
00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:09.340
But his wife doesn't want to divorce him

6
00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:12.740
Then the rich man had to put his wife in a mental hospital

7
00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:17.280
From then on, this woman can only suffer cruel torture in the dark

8
00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:18.220
And treatment

9
00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:19.380
Scary

10
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.100
Then the woman was saved

11
00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.480
It was made into a movie.

12
00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.040
That would cause a global sensation.

13
00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.940
But this is just a case of being saved.

14
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.420
There are still many others who don't know and can't see

15
00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.440
But that doesn't mean it doesn't exist

16
00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:35.220
There are many similar cases in the country

17
00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.160
I know, so what?

18
00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.740
He is an adult

19
00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.000
A former chairperson's wife

20
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.440
He knew what Cui Yan would do to him

21
00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.300
So do you think he's calmed down?

22
00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.660
He will only get more and more afraid

23
00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:51.460
As he grew more and more afraid

24
00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:53.820
When you can't stand it

25
00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:55.780
Will take the initiative to come to us

26
00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.940
Gao, Lawyer Tang, don't flatter me

27
00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:00.300
Can you be honest?

28
00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.220
Don't make me use special means no

29
00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.080
Do you want to beat, scold or kill monsters?

30
00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.980
Scold you

31
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.200
The little kid learned badly

32
00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.040
It's glib.

33
00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:11.780
Tang Lu, someone is taking pictures

34
00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.140
It uses luminous 8K 8G double leak-proof.

35
00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:17.920
Tracking up to 20 frames per second

36
00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:19.380
So professional

37
00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:20.320
Of course!

38
00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.260
I learned it when I studied the case before

39
00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:27.180
You are bluffing me

40
00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.000
Who followed me in the middle of the night?

41
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.420
You might be following me, that's not true

42
00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:36.000
One day, I asked mysteriously for a long time, a sentence of truth, we came out, do you not want to enter the door again?

43
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.100
Come on, Tang Lu

44
00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:39.560
I just want to come in again I don't want to go anywhere why

45
00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:40.540
because

46
00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:42.760
I like someone

47
00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:45.340
Who do you like?
