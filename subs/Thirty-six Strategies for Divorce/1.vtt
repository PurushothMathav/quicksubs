00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:04.380
I married him when he was still looked down upon like a dog

2
00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:06.500
I gave birth to him

3
00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:08.960
I gave him all my belongings to start a business

4
00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:10.360
But in the end, what did he do to me?

5
00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:14.360
Look what that beast did to me

6
00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:15.640
Why is that?

7
00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:18.220
Lawyer Tang, tell me why?

8
00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:20.260
You called me here to listen to your complaints

9
00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.160
Why are you so lack of compassion?

10
00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:23.780
We are all women

11
00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:25.600
Is it useful for me to pity you?

12
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:26.840
I'm a lawyer.

13
00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:28.180
Not an emotional live streaming host

14
00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:29.360
Are you inseparable?

15
00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:30.980
I want a divorce

16
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:34.940
But what if I leave my two children?

17
00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:37.700
Why are you ignoring me?

18
00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:40.900
Hey, lawyer Tang, don't leave?

19
00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:43.120
I'll continue for another hour

20
00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.500
Do you think you can buy my time with money?

21
00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:48.900
When you think clearly and think about leaving, the lawyer will come to me.

22
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.820
Hey, Lawyer Tang, Lawyer Tang

23
00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:54.820
Did you ask for it?

24
00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.200
What's wrong with this thief and these women?

25
00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.140
Does this kind of man not divorce and stay home for the New Year?

26
00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.300
He can hit you once, he can hit you twice

27
00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:03.700
Martyr Tang, our boss wants to see

28
00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:04.920
Who's your boss?

29
00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.460
Sorry for the inconvenience.

30
00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:08.500
Sorry no appointment

31
00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.940
A barrister doesn't have the guts, does he?
