00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:03.240
Hey, you didn't tell me what happened?

2
00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:04.400
Didn't I just find out?

3
00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:06.240
I'm talking about the chicken blood spilled on the door

4
00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:07.640
Can you really hold your breath?

5
00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:10.480
I still want to make dumplings for me, I thought you were in a good mood

6
00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:12.800
So you mean I shouldn't make dumplings for you?

7
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:13.980
Not that.

8
00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:16.380
Are you supposed to tell me that?

9
00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.300
Made me think you had something

10
00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:20.040
I thought you liked me

11
00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:22.060
I just wanted to stay at my place for a few days

12
00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:23.860
Is it a little kid?

13
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:25.420
Why don't you speak?

14
00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:26.960
Do you like me or not?

15
00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.200
How did you chat today?

16
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.500
You can say whatever I ask you

17
00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:32.360
Hey

18
00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:35.640
Responsible for you again

19
00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.240
I said take you to the hospital, if you don't go, don't blame me, I just want to know what you think of me

20
00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:41.520
Are you in love?

21
00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:42.600
Don't do work

22
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:43.640
The research failed

23
00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:45.000
Didn't even take the case

24
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.200
Master Kong said that food color is also

25
00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.440
If I can't even feel my most basic happiness

26
00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.100
What do I work for?

27
00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.080
Master Gai is right

28
00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:54.080
That's a lot.

29
00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:55.320
Yes, it's a lot of talking.

30
00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.740
Are you going to tell Zhang or not, otherwise can you wake up and don't keep making such jokes with me?

31
00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:01.560
We are this generation apart

32
00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:04.360
I don't want to mess with this shit every day with a little kid

33
00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.420
Like it or don't like it?

34
00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.360
Then I must perform well in the future

35
00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:09.740
Try to make you like it.
