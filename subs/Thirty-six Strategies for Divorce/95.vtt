00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:03.700
I'm going to see my dad

2
00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.400
I haven't seen him since my parents got divorced

3
00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.700
Because he hurt our mother too deeply back then

4
00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:10.420
Our mother almost jumped off the building back then

5
00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:12.100
So I swear

6
00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:13.660
Never see you again

7
00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:15.300
Then why did you go again?

8
00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:16.520
Because of you.

9
00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:18.300
Don't put everything on my head

10
00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:20.580
No, it's really you.

11
00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:21.720
Tell me about it.

12
00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.060
My dad's lawyer has been contacting me for the last year

13
00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:26.580
Said he was not in good health and didn't have much time

14
00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.520
The only regret is that no one inherited a pile of family property

15
00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:31.020
That's why I've been looking for me

16
00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.040
But I can't lose my opportunity for that money

17
00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.440
But then I gave in because of you

18
00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:37.620
What because of me

19
00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.220
You say your personality

20
00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.260
Maybe one day the lawyer's license will be revoked

21
00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.140
How can I support you if I don't have any money in my hand?

22
00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:47.820
So I bowed to my dad

23
00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:49.840
Who let him have money in his hands?

24
00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:51.800
In case something happens to you

25
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.540
I can still fish you out with money

26
00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:56.280
Humph

27
00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:02.580
Get up, get up, get up, oh, husband, does it hurt? I'll rub it for you. Don't you blame me for not having integrity?

28
00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.020
I care more about you thinking of me

29
00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.980
that

30
00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:12.180
Do you need a reward?

31
00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.460
What are you doing?

32
00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:18.900
I knelt for a long time just now

33
00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.220
I want to move

34
00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:24.580
Is that okay?

35
00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:29.420
Hey
