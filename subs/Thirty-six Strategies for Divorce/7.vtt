00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:01.740
This case is not that simple

2
00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:03.140
There must be something wrong

3
00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:06.740
Um, can I say something about that?

4
00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:10.260
Cui Yan is suing you, which in itself increases exposure

5
00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:12.660
Plus Lan Kexin, he's a star

6
00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:14.720
Isn't that the end?

7
00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:17.600
So you mean they have a grudge, right?

8
00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:22.060
I suspected he was the one who broke our news to his wife

9
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:23.900
So it is.

10
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.100
Thieves hate today

11
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.520
Didn't you hear?

12
00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:29.160
Transfer the account and show your love

13
00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.220
They have a grudge

14
00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:32.780
It won't really die together.

15
00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:35.220
So what's going on?

16
00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:36.720
Even if they have a grudge

17
00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:37.600
They are all defendants

18
00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:38.940
And you are the plaintiff's attorney

19
00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.680
I don't care. We have to find out.

20
00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:45.300
My client may have been pressured and taken advantage of. They are husband and wife anyway

21
00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:46.860
What happened to the couple?

22
00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:50.120
Where are the car keys?

23
00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:50.920
Hey

24
00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.980
Sure enough, the whole body is anti-bone

25
00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.220
Don't do what you have to do

26
00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:02.140
Where is it?

27
00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:06.780
Otherwise, I'll drive you

28
00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.440
Ok, me too.

29
00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:09.280
Excuse me.

30
00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.740
Can't sit on the bike?

31
00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:15.820
You are an intern

32
00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:18.320
Drive such a nice car

33
00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.620
Borrow it from a friend

34
00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:22.300
Ah!

35
00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.260
Borrowing luxury cars to pick up girls?

36
00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.540
Just like you, you still go to graduate school

37
00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:32.920
Don't think about it, stay for a few days and get out

38
00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:34.580
Kinmen won't keep people like you

39
00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:39.740
Hey what are you doing
