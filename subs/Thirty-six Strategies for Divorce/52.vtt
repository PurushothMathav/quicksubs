00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.320
Director, don't look for me for two days

2
00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:09.500
I'm afraid of what?

3
00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:11.040
You didn't kill people

4
00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.760
I always feel like I'm doing something wrong

5
00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:14.340
I feel bad.

6
00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:16.900
I'm not here to discuss with you

7
00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:20.080
You think, people are dead

8
00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:22.180
Anyway, there is no proof of death, right?

9
00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:25.400
Director, you want to kill me alive

10
00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.280
Don't talk nonsense, then how can I give up on you?

11
00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:29.400
What do you mean?

12
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.000
I'm sorry, I can only sacrifice you.

13
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.300
You think, the police will eventually find you

14
00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:36.920
For the sake of the bigger picture

15
00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:38.120
And for yourself

16
00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:39.980
I don't have to tell you.

17
00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:48.840
Xiaotong, what's your situation?

18
00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.780
I don't want to do it anymore.

19
00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:53.100
You are Tang Lu's assistant

20
00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:54.280
Is there any mistake?

21
00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.380
Tang Lu is gone, why should I keep it?

22
00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.240
Tang Lu is temporarily suspended

23
00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:59.420
Not resignation

24
00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:03.320
You can't escape death in a place like this

25
00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.400
Hey, aren't you that assistant?

26
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.360
What about your lawyer Tang?

27
00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.700
Why isn't he answering the phone?

28
00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:09.180
Tang Lu has been suspended

29
00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:10.780
Tang Lu has been suspended

30
00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.380
Then what should I do?
