00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:01.980
I said everything I had to say

2
00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:04.180
Instead of wasting your time here

3
00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:05.540
It's better to investigate Cui Yan

4
00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:07.600
Cui Yan, we will investigate

5
00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.140
Don't worry about that.

6
00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:11.700
But I can give you a new idea.

7
00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:16.200
You said that Cui Yan personally came to me to take Wang Yimei's case and asked me to take it

8
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:17.440
I couldn't figure it out either.

9
00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:20.780
Why did he let Wang Yimei take himself to court?

10
00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:23.520
Of course, even though he denied it

11
00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:25.400
He said it was his wife who was suing him.

12
00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.040
He's just making it easier for his wife to find a lawyer

13
00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:30.120
Cui Yan found the name directly by himself

14
00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:31.860
Yes, yes.

15
00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.140
I can testify

16
00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.100
Although I didn't see Tang Lu's first meeting with Cui Yan

17
00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.360
But I was a witness to the two meetings between Tang Lu and Wang Yimei after that

18
00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:43.680
Wang Yimei agreed that Cui Yan helped him find Tang Lu

19
00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.020
What does that mean?

20
00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:46.220
First I ask you

21
00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.060
Have you ever seen such a case?

22
00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:50.020
Take the initiative to take yourself to court

23
00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.500
Never seen it, it's a coincidence

24
00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:53.620
That's right.

25
00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.260
When something goes wrong, there must be a demon

26
00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.420
There must be some dark secrets behind this case

27
00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:00.160
In fact, I noticed it at the time

28
00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.420
But I can't ask

29
00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:05.560
Wang Yimei is unhappy when she bites to death

30
00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.400
But people are dead now

31
00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:08.800
But the people are still alive.

32
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.500
Hypnosis is the heart of the matter

33
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:12.920
This has been done twice.

34
00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.800
The first time he asked his wife to sue him for an affair.

35
00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.540
And demand a public apology and removal from public office

36
00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.460
The second time was to question the wife's suicide

37
00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.240
It's like I'm afraid I can't make a sound

38
00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.180
For fear that others will not know what happened to his house

39
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.840
Cui Yuan has always been a dutiful person

40
00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.920
Don't you think it's weird to do that?

41
00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.100
We will report the doubts you raise to our superiors.
