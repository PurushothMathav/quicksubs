00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.720
Does Uncle Gai know why you were invited here today?

2
00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:04.680
Are you mistaken?

3
00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:06.580
It's not me who should be here

4
00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:07.480
Uncle Guy

5
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.360
Still not telling the truth

6
00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.500
Since you and my father are old classmates

7
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:13.120
I'll give you one more chance.

8
00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:14.880
If you don't tell the truth

9
00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:15.880
I can't help you.

10
00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:18.220
Uncle Guy, what do you want me to say?

11
00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:21.380
Dare you say how do you do this?

12
00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:24.780
Hey this

13
00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.000
How do you have this video?

14
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.440
Don't ask this.

15
00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:29.880
Now where does that leave us?

16
00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.560
Is there a problem with me as a leader arranging some work for my subordinates?

17
00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:35.960
Uncle Guy, stop quibbling

18
00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.960
These videos together have been discussed by the bureau

19
00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:40.660
We are all people in the judicial circle

20
00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.340
Do I need to tell you more?

21
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.300
You are suspected of falsifying information

22
00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:45.720
Induction of parties beyond their authority

23
00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.560
This case was taken over by Tang Jian's parents

24
00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:52.160
You sent someone to meet with the client without his knowledge

25
00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.220
That's a pretty big problem.

26
00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.860
Tang Jian ignored the demands of the parties involved

27
00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.280
Forced the parties to go to the hospital and asked him to explain other problems

28
00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.880
Shouldn't I be the director?

29
00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:05.360
Uncle Guy, don't confuse the concepts

30
00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:06.760
Those are two different things.

31
00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:08.460
You can teach him to his face.

32
00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:09.880
What is behind the scenes?

33
00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.080
The last person Wang Yimei saw before her death was Bai Xiaotong, who you sent

34
00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.900
Bai Xiaotong has already explained

35
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.300
You are completely contrary to Tang Jie's train of thought

36
00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.120
Wang Yi was already suffering from mental illness

37
00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:23.120
How do you make him process two completely contradictory ideas?

38
00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:26.780
So actually your intentions are good.

39
00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.580
But the consequences are irreparable

40
00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:32.960
Although there is no direct evidence to prove that you are inescapably responsible

41
00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:34.560
But one thing is for sure

42
00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.680
If Wang Yi doesn't die, it has nothing to do with you.

43
00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.860
Should I say that Tang Jian is not responsible?
