00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:01.220
I said can't leave

2
00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:02.320
Naturally, I have my reasons.

3
00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:03.720
If you have to leave

4
00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:04.900
I won't stop you either.

5
00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.640
You just said that your husband is not very rich.

6
00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:10.140
But he bought that woman a house and a car

7
00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:11.840
If you divorce now

8
00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:12.920
What to raise a daughter

9
00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:15.380
But I can fight for some joint property.

10
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.200
As much as you can fight for

11
00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.360
People like your mother-in-law and your husband

12
00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:20.880
How much do you think you can get?

13
00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.080
But isn't there still your lawyer here? Let me put it this way

14
00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.320
If your family has 1 million

15
00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:29.480
No matter how good a lawyer you hire, you can only get 50 for you.

16
00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:31.020
Tang Lu, you are joking

17
00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:33.540
Our family shouldn't be that poor.

18
00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:34.360
You see

19
00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.260
You don't even know how much money your family has now.

20
00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.080
From the moment you got married

21
00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:41.820
It has always been your husband who earns money and your mother-in-law who manages the money

22
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.460
Your family's money has nothing to do with you

23
00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.040
But I didn't expect such a day to come

24
00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:50.160
Then think carefully about why your husband and your mother-in-law treat you like this.

25
00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.220
It must be to get rid of me quickly so that I can make room for that woman

26
00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:55.320
This sentence is nonsense

27
00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.040
Lawyer based on my years of experience

28
00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:59.280
If nothing else

29
00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.900
Your family's money is now in that woman's name

30
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:03.760
How is that possible?

31
00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:06.460
They're ready to kick you out

32
00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.480
If I'm right

33
00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:10.260
You won't get a penny.

34
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.120
There may also be debt

35
00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:13.720
So what should I do now?

36
00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:18.580
So I said I can't get a divorce for the time being, but I really can't stay in this family for a day

37
00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:19.860
What is there to cry

38
00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.160
To be honest, I can help you solve these problems.

39
00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:23.700
But I need an attitude from you

40
00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:25.260
A powerful attitude

41
00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:27.580
How can I help you file a lawsuit if you are so crying?

42
00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.060
I've always wondered what

43
00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.760
This Tang Jian and the parties train him like a grandson every time

44
00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:34.800
Hey these people

45
00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.360
Just stick to him and never give up

46
00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.920
What are you trying to say?

47
00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:43.880
Oops, I'm just mad, but I lick my face every time I smile so I can talk, just like his grandson

48
00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.100
Well, in the end, they stood up.

49
00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:48.300
Good lawyer tang

50
00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.360
I don't suffer anymore

51
00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:50.840
You tell me what to do.

52
00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:51.840
I listen to you

53
00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.020
So you do what I say next
