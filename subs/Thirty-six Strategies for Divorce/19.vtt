1
00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:01.940
Pang Pang Lawyer

2
00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:05.380
We are so destined

3
00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.640
Isn't this Barrister Xiao, the head of Kirin Law Firm?

4
00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:09.900
each other

5
00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.100
I wouldn't dare

6
00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:12.820
I don't sell my hue

7
00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:14.740
Mr. Tang

8
00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:17.220
Joking or mastering

9
00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:18.900
No need

10
00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.580
This is not in court

11
00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:21.820
I have my sense of proportion.

12
00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:24.180
Then again

13
00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:27.800
Lawyer Tang Lan Kexing's case is now being hyped up

14
00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.440
I guess the court session will be live.

15
00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:32.560
At that time, I will ask Lawyer Tang to show mercy in court

16
00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:35.200
Little lawyer, you may be overthinking

17
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.000
Lan Kexing's case is over after mediation

18
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.820
It's over, can't go to court, wow

19
00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.300
Don't be so miserable

20
00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.560
I'm still looking forward to a showdown with Mr. Tang in court

21
00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:48.460
duel

22
00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.420
A duel goes to court class

23
00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.540
Could it be that Barrister Xiao is concerned about his gender?

24
00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:01.340
What's the misunderstanding?

25
00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.040
Is Lawyer Tang really a beautiful snake venom?

26
00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.520
You flatter me.

27
00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:12.100
If you have the time to talk, you might as well go back and think about how Lan Kexin's apology should be written

28
00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.520
Otherwise, don't be in a hurry then.

29
00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:15.340
Tang Jian

30
00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:17.520
Don't get carried away.

31
00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.660
Coach, don't be duplicitous.

32
00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.380
Can you please stop following me? I'm begging you.

33
00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.500
Zhang Boran, who are those two?
