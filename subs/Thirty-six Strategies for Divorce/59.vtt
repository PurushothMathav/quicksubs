00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.960
Director Guy, the situation is not good for us now.

2
00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:04.840
Isn't this all your bad idea?

3
00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:06.920
You agreed when I came up with the idea

4
00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:08.320
You can quit if you don't agree

5
00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:09.400
Stop talking about that

6
00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:11.840
As long as Bai Xiaotong can hold on, we'll be fine

7
00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:13.600
Bai Xiaotong can still do it.

8
00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:15.340
One person does everything

9
00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:16.620
Not for us

10
00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:17.800
Is he ok?

11
00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.220
What can happen?

12
00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:20.580
You're just asking.

13
00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:22.680
After all, people commit suicide

14
00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.400
It has nothing to do with reason.

15
00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.880
Tang Jian acts as the lawyer for the deceased

16
00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.000
He should be able to quit

17
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.220
That's for sure.

18
00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:31.760
Otherwise, the boss can let us drive him back

19
00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:33.540
So to speak

20
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.180
Cui Yan is the key

21
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.200
So if we can find out something else

22
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.840
Is it completely over for my cousin?

23
00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:40.220
I hope so.

24
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:41.700
Yes, not necessarily.

25
00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:42.800
What do you mean?

26
00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.860
I've been thinking about it for the past two days.

27
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.720
I always feel like we made a big mistake

28
00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:48.320
What do you mean?

29
00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:50.800
You think, Cui Yan is such a big person

30
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.000
You have to be very thoughtful.

31
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.740
But he just handed the case over to Tang Jian

32
00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.100
When I went out to meet him that day

33
00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.880
Tell him our firm supports his idea

34
00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.780
But he wasn't as satisfied as he should have been.

35
00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.140
He's such a big shot!

36
00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:08.920
Happy to let you see him dance

37
00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:10.660
And here's the thing.

38
00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.680
But I just don't think something is right.

39
00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.220
You forgot how angry his legs can be when Prince Ma of the Tang family doesn't go to the hospital

40
00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:18.840
I know that.

41
00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.420
He also said he was punishing himself.

42
00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.460
Made an unforgivable mistake

43
00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:27.060
But I still feel something is wrong
