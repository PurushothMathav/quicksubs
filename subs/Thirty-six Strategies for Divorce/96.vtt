00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:03.760
Do you know how to come back?

2
00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:05.260
Who called you my mother?

3
00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:08.260
This is three months of living expenses. Who is he?

4
00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:11.780
He's my boyfriend!

5
00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:13.500
Let me introduce you

6
00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:14.640
His name is Zhang Boran

7
00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:18.060
I don't care, I actually have a boyfriend, what do you want to say?

8
00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:21.520
I know I'm sorry for you.

9
00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:24.300
It's me who is weak and incompetent as a mother

10
00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.160
But I raised you anyway

11
00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.480
You are promising now

12
00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.480
After calling a boyfriend, there will be children

13
00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:31.960
But have you ever thought that without me

14
00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:33.280
Can you have everything you have now?

15
00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:34.080
No.

16
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.580
Without you, I wouldn't even have a chance to be born

17
00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.400
How can I be so happy?

18
00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:42.260
So you give me this money

19
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.420
Tang Jian, don't think I don't know that you are a famous lawyer

20
00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:48.500
Lawyers earn about the same

21
00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:49.820
You do it

22
00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:51.820
Heaven will see.

23
00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.740
Then let God see

24
00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.760
Aren't you afraid that your future children will do the same to you?

25
00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.000
Then do you think I will pretend to treat you for fear that my children will see it?

26
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.940
I am an incompetent woman

27
00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:06.320
It's good that I didn't let you die at your dad's hands

28
00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:07.500
What else do you want from me?

29
00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.020
I don't dislike your incompetence.

30
00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.340
But please don't use your incompetence as an excuse to kidnap me morally

31
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.180
Are you all right?

32
00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.380
I'm fine.

33
00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:31.260
Maybe I didn't practice enough

34
00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:33.780
I owe him one.

35
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.620
But the opening was hollowed out

36
00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:39.820
I was terrified to see him.

37
00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:42.460
It used to be a transfer every time.

38
00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:45.380
Why am I today

39
00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:49.020
Let me show you my past

40
00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.980
Our children will be very happy

41
00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:57.980
Because we all understand

42
00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:03.040
I love you too.
