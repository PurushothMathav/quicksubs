00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.300
My first lawsuit since I got my lawyer's license

2
00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:05.160
Is to take my dad to court

3
00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.100
That's when I said I wanted to kill him

4
00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:08.720
Not to scare anyone

5
00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:10.220
I really wanted to kill him

6
00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.660
But I can't do it.

7
00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.380
For killing for life

8
00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:16.140
I have to die too

9
00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:18.160
And you know what?

10
00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:21.320
I gave myself the name Tang Jian when I was in college

11
00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.340
My previous name was Don Duoduo

12
00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:26.500
I don't want to be as useless as a flower

13
00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:28.620
I want to be as sharp as a sword

14
00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:31.220
Now you are

15
00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:34.060
I'm not.

16
00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:36.380
I'm still useless

17
00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:38.500
I still get scared.

18
00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:41.860
Don't be afraid, I'm here.

19
00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.020
No one will bully you again

20
00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:47.100
Really? Then if I get old in the future

21
00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.400
If I'm ugly, I can't make money. Will you hit me?

22
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.040
What are you talking about, Sister Tang, Tang Duoduo, what are you thinking?

23
00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.340
From now on, I will call you Duoduo by a beautiful name

24
00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.340
But my mom told me

25
00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:00.440
My dad used to be nice to him when he was chasing my mom

26
00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.260
But it wasn't until after I was born

27
00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:03.940
My dad started drinking

28
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:07.740
I used to come home five minutes late from school and get kicked out by my dad.

29
00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:09.740
Don't think about it.

30
00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:12.980
We don't want that, okay?

31
00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:14.980
Our future

32
00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.220
It must be sunny.

33
00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:18.740
Flowers

34
00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.620
Okay, messed up future.

35
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.560
Good news for you

36
00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.900
Gaiyu was invited to tea by the Judicial Bureau

37
00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.460
He's a guest at the Justice Bureau

38
00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.080
Yeah, that's why I dare to tell you

39
00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:37.220
Otherwise, I'm afraid you can't have fun in vain

40
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.120
I have to cheer up.

41
00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:41.800
Okay, I'll allow you to stop for a few more days.

42
00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:42.680
Yes, I'm here.

43
00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:44.120
I would do anything for you.

44
00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:45.420
Really? Hmm?
