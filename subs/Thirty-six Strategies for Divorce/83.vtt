00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.300
Before, we all suspected that Cui Yan was involved in Wang Yimei's death

2
00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:05.020
I even think he is shouting to catch a thief

3
00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:09.220
That's because we're all stuck on the real relationship between Cui Yan and Wang Yimei

4
00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:12.100
Because I said that Wang Yimei was once a victim of domestic violence

5
00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:14.960
And the police also verified this on the body

6
00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:17.380
But Wang Yimei may have committed suicide

7
00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:18.860
So in this matter

8
00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:20.560
Cui Yan may indeed be innocent

9
00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:21.480
It really is.

10
00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.080
We searched for a long time and couldn't find a reason

11
00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.920
That's right.

12
00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:26.700
Because that's not the point at all

13
00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:31.220
Cui Yan asked Wang Yimei to sue him for having an affair with Lan Kexin. It's not a conscience at all

14
00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:33.440
But to let more people know about it

15
00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:35.500
Do you remember our first meeting?

16
00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.880
At that time, you told me that you said that Cui Yan asked me to take this case

17
00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:42.620
It is because I want to borrow my personal influence to make the buttons popular

18
00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.920
I remember, but why would he do that?

19
00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.400
I couldn't figure it out at the time.

20
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.020
But then it hit me.

21
00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:50.640
Because he is on the Mingxiu plank road

22
00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:51.640
Darkness Chencang

23
00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:53.180
What is his true purpose?

24
00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:58.460
Some time ago, the above released a message saying that it would conduct a large-scale card drawing for the following corporate leaders

25
00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:01.240
Do you remember that there is indeed such a thing

26
00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:03.760
But later, for some reason, it was temporarily stranded.

27
00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:05.460
Because for some people

28
00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:07.100
It's nothing more than spooking the snake

29
00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.460
So they had to act

30
00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:10.560
Do something.

31
00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.540
I seem to understand, but
