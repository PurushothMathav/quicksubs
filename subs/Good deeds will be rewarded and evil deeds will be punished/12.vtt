00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.660
lifesaving indecent assault

2
00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:03.620
Hahahaha

3
00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:05.460
Why are you laughing?

4
00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:08.140
It's okay to continue your performance

5
00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:09.840
What's wrong? What's wrong?

6
00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.500
He stripped me of my clothes

7
00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:15.800
What do you mean by the surname Su? Even if my girlfriend accidentally spilled wine on you

8
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.140
You might as well

9
00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.200
Do you believe in raping Chen Shao?

10
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:22.200
Don't get excited

11
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.060
Maybe there is some misunderstanding.

12
00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:25.260
What misunderstanding can there be?

13
00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.340
He stripped my clothes here

14
00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:28.640
Yes, Wan Qing

15
00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:30.500
Where did you find this person?

16
00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:32.000
The quality is too low

17
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.200
How can such a person stand with us?

18
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.420
What a shame

19
00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.080
I heard that the former vice president of their company was also like this.

20
00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:44.260
Does your company specialize in cultivating social scum like you? Are you done?

21
00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.080
Is that my turn to say?

22
00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:47.480
What else do you have to say?

23
00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.180
What do you want to say after doing such a shameless thing?

24
00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:51.360
Mr. Gu, right?

25
00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.340
Which eye did you see?

26
00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:54.580
No evidence.

27
00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.180
Indiscriminate slander

28
00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.920
No, how dare you talk to me like that?

29
00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.900
You dare to scold me, why don't I dare to talk to you like that?

30
00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.300
Or do you feel bad?
