00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:01.380
Help me

2
00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:03.180
Help me

3
00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:05.980
Help me! Come here

4
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.980
I see you women

5
00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:10.360
I see who can save you.

6
00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:11.160
Hurry up!

7
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:12.380
Give you face

8
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.840
Hey, it's not you coward, why don't you save people?

9
00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.260
Why don't you go yourself?

10
00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:21.780
I never go

11
00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.680
I'm a woman, you asked me to save people

12
00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:26.580
Are you out of your mind?

13
00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:28.120
Saving people is love

14
00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:29.540
It is duty not to save

15
00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.740
If you don't go with your body, what moral kidnapping will let me go?

16
00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.760
Are you a big man and not a turtle?

17
00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.760
Does he have any conscience or blood?

18
00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.940
It's just you

19
00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:44.080
No.

20
00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.260
Why don't you let your boyfriend go?

21
00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:51.760
It's me, not so many of them. What should I do if his boyfriend is injured?

22
00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.460
What's that got to do with me?

23
00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.520
Yellow croaker, stop arguing

24
00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.680
Why haven't the police arrived after so long?

25
00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.100
The police arrived, and everyone was probably cold

26
00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.600
I saved you in my last life

27
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.040
You avenge your kindness

28
00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.480
It separated my wife.

29
00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:10.500
People's livelihood is in chaos

30
00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.580
This time I'd like to see what you do

31
00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.740
What do others want?

32
00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:19.600
you

33
00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:21.460
Don't want
