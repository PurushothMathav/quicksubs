00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:03.840
Oh, dear.

2
00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:05.280
Sorry, sorry.

3
00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:07.220
It's okay to get dirty for you. It's okay.

4
00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:08.980
I'm going to the bathroom first

5
00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:13.500
hairy feet

6
00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:14.720
Go and have a look.

7
00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:17.020
Hey, I'll go to Mr. Su now

8
00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.100
Miss Zhang, why are you here?

9
00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:35.160
What do you want?

10
00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.000
What does Miss Zhang mean by that?

11
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.760
I'm here for Miss Jiang's dinner party

12
00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.580
Miss Zhang invited me personally

13
00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.500
If you don't believe me, ask him what you just said.

14
00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:44.720
Are you mocking me?

15
00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:46.320
Mockery oh no

16
00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.920
I'm just stating a fact

17
00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.300
Isn't Miss Zhang trying to marry into a wealthy family?

18
00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.800
By the way, Miss Zhang may not have thought so at first

19
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.340
After all, when I was bullied at the barbecue stand that day

20
00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.520
Crying is really a wife, how dare you say it?

21
00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.560
Did you think you didn't hear what you said the other day?

22
00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:02.480
You are a coward

23
00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:03.280
Just a softie

24
00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:04.400
If it weren't for you

25
00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:05.920
How did I get so many slaps that day?

26
00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.520
Miss Zhang, what you said is wrong.

27
00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.380
Beating is kissing, scolding is love

28
00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.280
If it weren't for Mr. Chen's beating and scolding you

29
00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.080
How can you cross class to be his girlfriend?

30
00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:16.460
Enter this occasion

31
00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:17.740
I'm warning you!

32
00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:18.960
Get out of here if you are sensible

33
00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.360
Otherwise

34
00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:21.400
Otherwise, what will happen to you?

35
00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.240
I'd like to know

36
00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.960
In my last life?

37
00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:25.200
I kindly saved you

38
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.520
But you took revenge and killed me

39
00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.000
Now I'm far away

40
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.540
You still come to trouble me

41
00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:31.900
That being the case

42
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.060
Then don't blame me for being polite

43
00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.660
Help! Help! Help!
