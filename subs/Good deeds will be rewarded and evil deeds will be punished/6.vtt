00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:03.700
Su Hao, what do you mean?

2
00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:04.860
don't save

3
00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:07.060
What good is it to you to ruin me?

4
00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:10.540
Yeah, what's in it for you to ruin me?

5
00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.300
I have no enmity with you

6
00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:14.560
When you just called me a coward

7
00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:16.260
When the company fired me

8
00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.340
Did you ever think that you would destroy me by doing this?

9
00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:20.360
i

10
00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:22.260
I guess you're right.

11
00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:24.020
I'm just dying

12
00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:26.380
Because some people are worth paying

13
00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:29.100
Some people he deserves

14
00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:33.220
That's right, nosy is what you deserve

15
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.780
I have broadcast today's event live on the whole network.

16
00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.620
If you don't give me a reasonable explanation

17
00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:43.780
I'll ruin your reputation

18
00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.480
Oh look

19
00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.300
It's all hot

20
00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:53.780
Wang Chang

21
00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.220
Look at what you've done

22
00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:57.700
This happened to you

23
00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:00.700
How much reputational damage will it cause to the company?

24
00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.120
Chairperson, I tell you

25
00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.220
If you can't recover the company's losses

26
00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.480
Just wait for the lawyer's letter.

27
00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:09.220
Waiting for me to bankrupt you

28
00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:12.940
Chairperson Chairperson

29
00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:19.380
speak

30
00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:21.540
I was wrong.

31
00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:23.620
I shouldn't be nice to you

32
00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:25.780
I beg you

33
00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:27.860
Please help me
