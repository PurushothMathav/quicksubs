00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:01.200
Mr. Fang

2
00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:03.300
What do you mean by that?

3
00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:05.860
Chairperson, you don't know yet, do you?

4
00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.740
That thing at the barbecue stand last night

5
00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:10.500
What is he thinking too?

6
00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:15.140
What did you say?

7
00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.100
This time I won't mind my own business

8
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.540
But he didn't have the guts.

9
00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:24.140
Making excuses for myself

10
00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.920
Said it was a young couple quarreling

11
00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:28.900
I have never seen such a weak man

12
00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:30.500
And this kind of thing

13
00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:33.620
Su Hao really didn't expect you to be such a person

14
00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.000
Why don't you have any male blood at all?

15
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.840
Usually looks good alone

16
00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:39.280
I didn't expect to be so cowardly

17
00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.160
How could I be in the same company as someone like you?

18
00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.300
What a shame

19
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.040
Or is our party always amazing?

20
00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.840
You subdue the bad guy in two or three strokes.

21
00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.640
I'm really a role model

22
00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.900
Yes, we have to learn from Mr. Fang

23
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.660
What a hero.

24
00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.740
Chairperson to

25
00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:05.300
I think people like this have no love, no responsibility and responsibility.

26
00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:07.020
They don't deserve to stay in our company

27
00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:07.980
I suggest

28
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:09.600
fire you

29
00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.300
Fire me, I would like to ask which company rule I violated

30
00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:16.920
Saving people is love

31
00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.220
It is duty not to save

32
00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:20.680
Besides, in case you save that woman

33
00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:21.940
She's a viper

34
00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.780
She doesn't just appreciate you

35
00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:25.280
And accused you of raping her

36
00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.420
Your family was destroyed and your wife was separated

37
00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:30.700
You are cowardly

38
00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:32.540
And give yourself so many excuses

39
00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:34.320
Don't you think it's funny?

40
00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.420
I saved him.

41
00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.140
He thanked me before it was too late

42
00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.060
Why slander me

43
00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:40.860
Why are you blackmailing me?

44
00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.980
If you don't have the guts, don't make an excuse for not having the guts.

45
00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:47.980
That's him!

46
00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.220
Miss Zhang, why are you here?

47
00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.160
This also brought so many journalist friends

48
00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.480
Oops, these are all things I should do.

49
00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:58.900
And with great fanfare

50
00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.180
But I'm sorry.

51
00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.720
He beat up my boyfriend and raped me.

52
00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:07.240
He's not a hero at all

53
00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:08.900
He is a rapist.

54
00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:12.440
Sure enough, it should come or come

55
00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.860
So what do you do?
