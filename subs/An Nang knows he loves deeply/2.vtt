1
00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:03.000
The venue for the meeting of the Lin family

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.800
Regarding the shareholders' meeting scheduled for Chen Shixian

3
00:00:14.466 --> 00:00:16.266
How to wear dead people?

4
00:00:16.333 --> 00:00:21.200
Are you scared? Don't you find it more exciting?

5
00:00:21.366 --> 00:00:22.766
general meeting of shareholders

6
00:00:23.133 --> 00:00:24.266
The applicant opened

7
00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.400
Lin's Group's tens of billions of assets

8
00:00:27.933 --> 00:00:29.833
Finally belongs to me

9
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.600
What about me?

10
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.666
It would be great if Miss Lin Mo's house was today

11
00:01:01.666 --> 00:01:04.466
It's a pity that Lin's Group is brilliant

12
00:01:04.466 --> 00:01:06.466
It ended up in the hands of outsiders

13
00:01:06.466 --> 00:01:07.766
So sad.

14
00:01:07.766 --> 00:01:09.033
No one next door

15
00:01:09.066 --> 00:01:10.566
There's nothing we can do.

16
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.266
Lin's Group Today

17
00:01:12.266 --> 00:01:12.600
make friends

18
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.400
Husband of the late Miss Lin Mo Chen Shixian

19
00:01:15.766 --> 00:01:16.133
compare

20
00:01:16.133 --> 00:01:18.766
This is also what the eldest lady hopes to see in the spirit of heaven

21
00:01:18.766 --> 00:01:21.166
I just hope that the Lin family can continue to pass on

22
00:01:21.166 --> 00:01:23.400
We old guys can make up for it too

23
00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:24.533
That being the case

24
00:01:24.533 --> 00:01:28.200
Lin's Group will be changed to Chen's Group from today

25
00:01:28.933 --> 00:01:30.500
I changed my last name as soon as I took office

26
00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:31.600
How did he change it?

27
00:01:31.733 --> 00:01:34.366
Could it be that we have misjudged him for the past three years?

28
00:01:34.866 --> 00:01:35.966
That's not possible.

29
00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:37.200
Then vote

30
00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.633
Anyone who dares to object will get out of Lin's

31
00:01:39.733 --> 00:01:41.500
I am Lin's greatest enemy

32
00:01:41.866 --> 00:01:45.033
The forest is really going to disperse, I object
