1
00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:04.366
So what if you're the president of the Shure Group?

2
00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:07.800
What if the 100 billion orders are gone?

3
00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:10.766
I Emgrand Group is still Zheng Cheng's heaven

4
00:00:10.766 --> 00:00:11.766
And I

5
00:00:11.933 --> 00:00:14.900
Still the president of Emgrand Group, worth tens of billions

6
00:00:15.066 --> 00:00:17.433
Want to bring down our Emgrand Group

7
00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.166
I don't want to see if you have this ability.

8
00:00:20.166 --> 00:00:21.233
Really?

9
00:00:22.133 --> 00:00:23.700
Did you forget

10
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:25.866
Just signed a document this morning

11
00:00:29.133 --> 00:00:30.866
File husband

12
00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.066
This is the preparation document for today's signing ceremony

13
00:00:35.333 --> 00:00:36.700
Please sign it.

14
00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.900
That file is Lin's Group, no.

15
00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:45.766
It's now Emgrand.

16
00:00:45.766 --> 00:00:47.800
Documents for advance procurement

17
00:00:48.866 --> 00:00:49.733
You can fool me

18
00:00:49.733 --> 00:00:51.166
black and white

19
00:00:51.166 --> 00:00:52.666
I'm not forcing you.

20
00:00:53.533 --> 00:00:54.633
So

21
00:00:55.366 --> 00:00:57.166
The current Emgrand Group

22
00:00:57.166 --> 00:00:59.800
Without Shure's 100 billion investment

23
00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.566
But purchased hundreds of billions of materials in advance

24
00:01:03.466 --> 00:01:06.666
Chen Shijie, you are broke
