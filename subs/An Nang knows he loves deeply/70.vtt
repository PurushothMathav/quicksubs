00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.966
Mr. Lin, after the last time you talked to Mr. Sheng on the phone

2
00:00:02.966 --> 00:00:04.666
Mr. Sheng told me to follow up the whole process

3
00:00:04.766 --> 00:00:07.066
Make sure Lin's Group gets through this difficult time

4
00:00:07.266 --> 00:00:09.066
Thank you Mr. Sheng for me

5
00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:11.233
Wang Tezhu, what are you talking about?

6
00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:13.633
The person who contacted Shengshi Group was obviously me.

7
00:00:13.733 --> 00:00:14.766
Miss Amy

8
00:00:14.766 --> 00:00:15.800
I think you misunderstood

9
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.300
Shengshi Group has always looked at Mr. Lin's face

10
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.033
Only then did he agree to help Lin's Group

11
00:00:21.566 --> 00:00:23.700
Amy, I'm sorry.

12
00:00:23.766 --> 00:00:25.166
I'm too worried.

13
00:00:25.166 --> 00:00:26.800
I contacted Mr. Shun in person again

14
00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.800
You're not mad at me, are you?

15
00:00:30.333 --> 00:00:32.933
My wife blames me for being disliked

16
00:00:32.933 --> 00:00:36.133
The villain can't leave the group without you.

17
00:00:36.133 --> 00:00:38.666
But the evidence proves that

18
00:00:38.666 --> 00:00:40.700
I am the one who harmed Lin's Group

19
00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.166
What should I do with my husband?

20
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.633
I've asked the finance department to check it out.

21
00:00:44.666 --> 00:00:47.066
It was that bastard Lin Zhenyu who framed you

22
00:00:47.166 --> 00:00:49.266
Sight brother what are you talking about shut up
