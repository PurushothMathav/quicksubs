00:00:00.866 --> 00:00:04.366
Xiao Yan, you are not afraid that the wind will flash your tongue

2
00:00:04.366 --> 00:00:07.866
Who knows that five years ago, the Dragon King went into retreat and practiced

3
00:00:07.866 --> 00:00:10.433
You've been eating and drinking at my Li's house

4
00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:12.366
Dare to call yourself a dragon king

5
00:00:12.366 --> 00:00:14.600
What? He's fake?

6
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.200
Come down, boy

7
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:17.700
Don't ignore life and death

8
00:00:17.866 --> 00:00:20.766
This station is designed for the Dragon King

9
00:00:20.766 --> 00:00:22.600
On behalf of all the powerful people in the building

10
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.500
Submission to the Dragon King

11
00:00:24.766 --> 00:00:26.400
How dare you impersonate the Dragon King?

12
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.100
Offend all the powerful

13
00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:31.066
You must die tonight

14
00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.766
Half Hall Master killed me

15
00:00:36.166 --> 00:00:37.966
That's self-defeating

16
00:00:37.966 --> 00:00:39.500
Repeatedly show my dragon power

17
00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.166
Damn it's you

18
00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.266
Keep your eyes peeled.

19
00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.900
This is what only this Dragon King can wear, right?

20
00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:50.433
Shenlong Jade Shenlong Jade

21
00:00:50.666 --> 00:00:52.400
Hey, I know this.

22
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.366
Dragon Jade is a magic weapon worn by the Dragon King

23
00:00:55.366 --> 00:00:57.966
Look at his imposing manner, he really looks like a Dragon King

24
00:01:01.966 --> 00:01:03.566
My magic weapon

25
00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:06.900
How dare this kid impersonate me

26
00:01:07.133 --> 00:01:08.833
See how you end

27
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.600
Don't be fooled by him.

28
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.800
He is a liar

29
00:01:13.966 --> 00:01:17.433
Except for walking around the streets and deceiving people, shit will not

30
00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.100
I also want to take a piece of broken jade to cover it

31
00:01:20.533 --> 00:01:24.066
You and other ordinary people naturally do not know this treasure

32
00:01:24.566 --> 00:01:27.366
Today, I will call someone who knows the goods over.

33
00:01:29.266 --> 00:01:32.033
If the meal is within three minutes

34
00:01:32.166 --> 00:01:34.000
See me at the dragon feast in the future
