00:00:00.566 --> 00:00:01.666
daring madman

2
00:00:01.666 --> 00:00:02.800
The imperial staff is here

3
00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:04.466
Why don't you kneel down?

4
00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:05.600
Do you want to rebel?

5
00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.700
Minister Benlong King is proud of the world

6
00:00:08.733 --> 00:00:10.400
Always only kneel in heaven and earth

7
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.900
I'm afraid you can't take my bow

8
00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.400
Hahahaha

9
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.000
You can't even stand the Great Elder

10
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.100
Dare to impersonate the Dragon King

11
00:00:19.933 --> 00:00:23.400
Zhao Wuji Xiao Tianshi is the Supreme of Great Xia

12
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.200
You dare to let him worship you and be angry with God

13
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.766
I'm afraid you won't be able to withstand this curse

14
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.866
Even the scourge is involved in the scourge

15
00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:34.266
Why didn't you punish me?

16
00:00:34.266 --> 00:00:36.200
We are still alive and well

17
00:00:36.966 --> 00:00:40.000
Come on, break this kid's leg for me

18
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.366
Let this kid kneel in front of me for the rest of his life

19
00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.366
I'd rather take a look at this scourge

20
00:00:48.766 --> 00:00:51.266
What's wrong with me?

21
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.666
No need for the dead

22
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.133
You insist on making me kneel

23
00:00:55.133 --> 00:00:56.233
Fear of damnation

24
00:00:56.333 --> 00:00:58.433
Then I'll send you sick

25
00:01:04.333 --> 00:01:04.966
Grandpa

26
00:01:04.966 --> 00:01:08.066
I told you so. He can't afford a bow

27
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:12.600
It's Lord Scourge Dragon King, please get up

28
00:01:12.733 --> 00:01:15.033
Lord Dragon King, please get up

29
00:01:16.466 --> 00:01:17.866
Get up

30
00:01:20.733 --> 00:01:21.966
Lord Dragon King pardons his sins

31
00:01:21.966 --> 00:01:24.300
Today's events are all persecuted by Zhao Wuji

32
00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:26.266
Isn't it unintentional?

33
00:01:26.366 --> 00:01:27.266
Hey everyone

34
00:01:28.166 --> 00:01:30.000
He's not the Dragon King at all

35
00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:31.000
What about just now?

36
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.300
Just happened to hit a lightning bolt

37
00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:36.166
This imperial staff is handed down from generation to generation

38
00:01:36.166 --> 00:01:38.800
Research decline was diagnosed by thunder

39
00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:41.166
It has nothing to do with this kid

40
00:01:41.166 --> 00:01:43.966
Didn't you promise to send me soldiers?

41
00:01:43.966 --> 00:01:47.566
Am I not alive and well now?
