00:00:02.933 --> 00:00:05.433
Zhao Gongzi hahahaha

2
00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.266
That was five years ago.

3
00:00:07.266 --> 00:00:09.833
The Dragon King once said on the day of retreat

4
00:00:09.866 --> 00:00:10.900
When exiting customs

5
00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:14.200
Will put the much-anticipated Dragon King Palace agency

6
00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.766
Hand it over to our first family of Great Xia

7
00:00:16.766 --> 00:00:19.900
Who can compete with the Great Xia Zhao family

8
00:00:20.133 --> 00:00:22.333
That is, the first Wuzong Fan family

9
00:00:22.333 --> 00:00:26.500
It's a pity that the Fan family head Zhuge is bedridden with a strange disease

10
00:00:26.666 --> 00:00:30.266
From then on, the Fan family never got excited to take care of me

11
00:00:30.266 --> 00:00:34.433
The agency of this Dragon King Palace is none other than Mr. Zhao

12
00:00:34.466 --> 00:00:38.166
In the future, I will wait for Mr. Zhao, and the horse's head is a mountain

13
00:00:38.166 --> 00:00:40.766
Hahahaha congratulations to Mr. Zhao

14
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
This is Mr. Li that Mr. Zhao often mentions.

15
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.366
Oh, what a talented woman.

16
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:48.966
With the help of Mr. Zhao

17
00:00:48.966 --> 00:00:50.266
It won't be long

18
00:00:50.266 --> 00:00:54.666
Mr. Li's actions are above my expectations, hahaha.

19
00:00:54.666 --> 00:00:57.066
At that time, please give your seniors a lot of support

20
00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:58.533
15th of this month

21
00:00:58.533 --> 00:01:00.766
It was my wedding day with Mrs. Zhao

22
00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.500
Please come and join us

23
00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.900
It was Mr. Zhao who took the agency of the Dragon King Palace

24
00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:06.366
Hug the beauty again

25
00:01:06.366 --> 00:01:07.366
Double happiness

26
00:01:07.366 --> 00:01:10.200
Congratulations, congratulations, hahahaha.

27
00:01:10.666 --> 00:01:13.033
Who allowed you to get married?

28
00:01:13.266 --> 00:01:14.800
Why isn't he dead yet?

29
00:01:16.066 --> 00:01:18.166
Master, why are you here?

30
00:01:20.533 --> 00:01:24.366
It's a pity I'm not blind anymore
