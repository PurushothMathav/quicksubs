1
00:00:01.133 --> 00:00:02.300
Promise anything

2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.400
What do you want?

3
00:00:09.566 --> 00:00:12.066
It's too cold, I suggest you use the cape.

4
00:00:17.466 --> 00:00:19.700
I didn't think I just saw the light of day

5
00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:22.466
The first woman I saw was so beautiful

6
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.266
How could I have a nosebleed?

7
00:00:26.766 --> 00:00:29.266
Has my male masculinity also recovered?

8
00:00:31.166 --> 00:00:31.966
Angel

9
00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.400
Someone once gave me advice

10
00:00:34.533 --> 00:00:36.466
If anyone can take off my veil

11
00:00:36.466 --> 00:00:38.666
That's the man I was meant to be

12
00:00:38.933 --> 00:00:41.200
Since Xiao Tianshi has seen me take off my veil

13
00:00:41.366 --> 00:00:43.933
That Fan Ruoli wishes to promise each other

14
00:00:43.933 --> 00:00:45.300
Serve adults for life

15
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.966
No, no, no. Marriage is child's play

16
00:00:47.966 --> 00:00:51.200
Besides, I've lost interest in women

17
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.800
Oh, it's getting late. I've got to get to the feast.

18
00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:54.866
When I'm done

19
00:00:54.866 --> 00:00:56.966
I'll come back and treat your mother, okay?

20
00:00:56.966 --> 00:00:57.766
OK

21
00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.066
I wonder if I can fly

22
00:01:07.133 --> 00:01:10.233
Lend me that car key, thank you.

23
00:01:12.466 --> 00:01:13.300
This is a cell phone.

24
00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:14.766
It is convenient for you to contact me.

25
00:01:14.766 --> 00:01:17.733
Fan Ruolin is waiting for your money at any time.

26
00:01:17.733 --> 00:01:19.500
I'll give you the wholesale one back next time.

27
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:20.500
I'll go first

28
00:01:22.366 --> 00:01:23.833
Go to the upgrade banquet

29
00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:26.433
He must be the Dragon King

30
00:01:27.066 --> 00:01:28.600
I must marry him

31
00:01:28.866 --> 00:01:32.833
Walk back and take my mother to the Dragon Rising Banquet

32
00:01:36.333 --> 00:01:38.566
Where is my jade? Where is my jade?

33
00:01:40.466 --> 00:01:43.200
It's useless to practice magic for 5 years

34
00:01:43.333 --> 00:01:45.166
The magic weapon is lost

35
00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:47.900
Here we go.

36
00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.566
Shenlong Jade helps the silly boy regain his sight

37
00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.200
He actually thought he had learned magic

38
00:01:53.466 --> 00:01:56.366
Isn't this going to die?

39
00:01:56.366 --> 00:01:59.666
Sin, sin, come back
