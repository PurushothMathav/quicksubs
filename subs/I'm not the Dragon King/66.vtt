00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.800
The dean represents the law of Kyoto

2
00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:06.400
Your sister stole something and you dare to resist law enforcement

3
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.166
Well, I have a hundred ways to pry his mouth

4
00:00:10.566 --> 00:00:12.433
I-I really didn't steal it.

5
00:00:12.866 --> 00:00:14.466
If you say you didn't steal it, you didn't steal it.

6
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:18.300
How do you put that thing? It's gone in a while

7
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.233
It grew wings and flew away

8
00:00:21.366 --> 00:00:22.566
Words are unfounded

9
00:00:22.866 --> 00:00:25.833
Just look at your monitoring, okay?

10
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:28.566
Go have a look

11
00:00:38.766 --> 00:00:40.666
I don't know who cut the monitoring line.

12
00:00:40.766 --> 00:00:42.700
Okay, Xiao Qianru

13
00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:44.666
How can you?

14
00:00:44.733 --> 00:00:46.533
I didn't expect you to have a plan

15
00:00:46.533 --> 00:00:49.366
Now what else do you have to say?

16
00:00:49.366 --> 00:00:50.500
It's really not me.

17
00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:51.733
I don't have it.

18
00:00:51.733 --> 00:00:54.300
I see you don't cry without seeing the coffin.

19
00:00:54.666 --> 00:00:56.966
I have a way to pry your mouth open

20
00:00:57.866 --> 00:01:00.300
Since you say my sister stole something

21
00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.100
Dare to make a bet with me?

22
00:01:02.333 --> 00:01:04.733
Didn't you just take off my sister's clothes?

23
00:01:04.733 --> 00:01:06.966
If my sister hadn't stolen anything

24
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.733
Do you dare to take off your clothes and parade through the streets?

25
00:01:09.733 --> 00:01:11.466
Do you dare to gamble?

26
00:01:11.733 --> 00:01:15.666
Okay, bet on calling someone for me

27
00:01:17.933 --> 00:01:21.966
Boy, if you can't prove he didn't steal anything

28
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.466
I'll send him to jail then.

29
00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.800
What your sister said is so fine-skinned and tender

30
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.600
I'm afraid it will be robbed and used as a plaything

31
00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.300
Hahahaha
