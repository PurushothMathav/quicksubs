00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:01.300
Pardon me?

2
00:00:01.766 --> 00:00:03.833
That old man is the Dragon King

3
00:00:04.733 --> 00:00:07.366
The dead god made me offend the Dragon King

4
00:00:07.366 --> 00:00:08.800
Break my Zhao family's way of life

5
00:00:11.333 --> 00:00:14.166
I won't let them go.

6
00:00:14.166 --> 00:00:17.600
Hurry up and go to the Hall of Heavenly Kings to find your uncle

7
00:00:18.266 --> 00:00:22.200
Except for your uncle's old age

8
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.433
Practice three years ago

9
00:00:24.866 --> 00:00:28.433
The imperial teacher who has been named a hero by the king

10
00:00:28.566 --> 00:00:30.700
Although he has no knowledge of the world

11
00:00:31.533 --> 00:00:35.300
But today, no matter what the Zhao family does

12
00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.000
Won't stand by

13
00:00:38.333 --> 00:00:41.866
You must find him and avenge me

14
00:00:44.666 --> 00:00:46.566
Grandpa

15
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:48.166
Grandpa

16
00:00:48.166 --> 00:00:51.866
When the old man was in seclusion, you told the world

17
00:00:52.166 --> 00:00:56.066
Anyone who lifts your veil will be Fan Fu Liang Xu

18
00:00:56.066 --> 00:00:58.666
Just now you said that woman has no eyes.

19
00:00:59.133 --> 00:01:01.700
Do you want to go back on it?

20
00:01:01.766 --> 00:01:03.300
I remember now.

21
00:01:03.666 --> 00:01:06.900
You were the one who pointed out marriage for me in the first place

22
00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:08.600
Hahahaha

23
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:09.566
Exactly.

24
00:01:09.866 --> 00:01:13.233
Xiao Yanwood dragon body jade unveils your veil again

25
00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:15.700
It's all destiny

26
00:01:15.966 --> 00:01:17.566
You want me to marry him?

27
00:01:18.866 --> 00:01:20.500
But the woman just said

28
00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.500
He's not even a man

29
00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:23.966
Let me emphasize.

30
00:01:23.966 --> 00:01:25.933
I only feel it when I have a car accident.

31
00:01:25.933 --> 00:01:27.300
Since it is destiny

32
00:01:27.566 --> 00:01:30.233
Do you want to lose your trust in the world?
