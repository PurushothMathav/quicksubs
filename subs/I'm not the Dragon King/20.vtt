00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:03.633
Who dares to bully my grandson?

2
00:00:03.933 --> 00:00:05.666
Grandpa, you came just in time

3
00:00:05.733 --> 00:00:07.800
My family joined forces with this magic stick to pretend to be the Dragon King

4
00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.366
How dare they hit me?

5
00:00:09.366 --> 00:00:11.033
Mainly they all die

6
00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:14.100
Uncle Fan Wu, hello

7
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:15.866
Hmm, that's right

8
00:00:15.866 --> 00:00:19.966
Lord Dragon King healed me with his own hands just now

9
00:00:19.966 --> 00:00:22.600
I think you really don't know life and death

10
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.500
Where can I find such a cat-headed boy?

11
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.466
How dare you impersonate a dragon?

12
00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.666
Well, look good.

13
00:00:28.866 --> 00:00:31.666
This is still me from the Dragon King Palace

14
00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:34.500
The Dragon King himself

15
00:00:34.866 --> 00:00:39.200
Void, why did he impersonate me?

16
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.400
I wanted to pretend to be the Dragon King

17
00:00:41.533 --> 00:00:43.166
Knock and muster one match

18
00:00:43.333 --> 00:00:45.766
I didn't expect you to do this

19
00:00:46.066 --> 00:00:49.633
Can the Fan family invite this kid to impersonate the Dragon King?

20
00:00:49.766 --> 00:00:53.633
He must have some real skills in him

21
00:00:53.733 --> 00:00:54.900
Who are you?

22
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.633
How dare you impersonate yourself?

23
00:00:57.166 --> 00:00:57.900
It's over. It's over.

24
00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:59.600
Swallowskin met the real thing

25
00:00:59.933 --> 00:01:01.000
daring madman

26
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.500
Dare to impersonate the Dragon King

27
00:01:02.733 --> 00:01:06.066
Zhao Wuji, you are really a thief shouting to catch a thief

28
00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.166
well known

29
00:01:08.166 --> 00:01:11.366
I once met the Dragon King

30
00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.900
This one around you is fake.

31
00:01:17.533 --> 00:01:20.200
Boy, I know you're fake

32
00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.100
But the guy on the other side isn't real either.

33
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.533
That's it.

34
00:01:24.533 --> 00:01:26.433
Want to live

35
00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:30.466
Gotta play it for me too wow

36
00:01:31.333 --> 00:01:34.000
It turns out that the one opposite is also fake.

37
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.666
Don't worry, acting is my old name

38
00:01:37.866 --> 00:01:40.300
The nameless rat dares to pretend to be the dragon king

39
00:01:40.333 --> 00:01:42.166
Believe it or not, I'll slap you to death with one palm.
