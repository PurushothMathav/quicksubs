00:00:02.766 --> 00:00:05.433
Lin Fan, I have a bad feeling

2
00:00:05.466 --> 00:00:07.900
I always have a feeling that something will go wrong at this temple fair today

3
00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:08.900
Ziqing River

4
00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:10.533
Just put your heart in your stomach

5
00:00:10.533 --> 00:00:11.600
Don't you still have me?

6
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:13.366
Ah Qinghe

7
00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:14.366
Long time no see!

8
00:00:14.366 --> 00:00:16.000
I heard Lin Fan brainwash you

9
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.366
Why is Xu Aoyu like a bullshit plaster?

10
00:00:18.366 --> 00:00:19.433
It's you everywhere.

11
00:00:19.466 --> 00:00:22.100
Qiao Qinghe, I advise you to understand the situation

12
00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:24.266
Today's auction is Lao Tzu's home court

13
00:00:26.366 --> 00:00:27.700
30 minutes left

14
00:00:27.966 --> 00:00:29.166
After 30 minutes

15
00:00:29.166 --> 00:00:31.800
My godfather would hand us the winning bid

16
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:32.866
I'll give you a chance.

17
00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:34.600
Now go to my bed and wait for me.

18
00:00:34.666 --> 00:00:36.100
Who owns Dawan Square?

19
00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:37.633
What he said today doesn't count

20
00:00:37.966 --> 00:00:39.366
The Lieutenant Governor said it doesn't count

21
00:00:39.366 --> 00:00:40.800
Could it be that you have the final say?

22
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.133
You don't deserve to eat it.

23
00:00:43.133 --> 00:00:43.933
Qinghe

24
00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:45.200
Here we go.

25
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.300
The dog will be born to you later

26
00:00:55.066 --> 00:00:55.300
Excuse me.

27
00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.200
Are you Ms. Qiao Qinghe, the representative of Qiao's Group?

28
00:00:58.366 --> 00:00:59.800
Yes, I am.

29
00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.066
The bidding will start soon.

30
00:01:01.066 --> 00:01:02.933
The Joe Group has not yet submitted a tender

31
00:01:02.933 --> 00:01:05.066
Do you want to give up the auction?

32
00:01:05.066 --> 00:01:05.966
What!

33
00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:08.366
Don't look for my sister.

34
00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.500
I already delivered the tender

35
00:01:10.866 --> 00:01:12.100
Xiao Weiwei, are you in a hurry?

36
00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.100
I'll tell you why the bid on my desk is missing

37
00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.366
Of course I know.

38
00:01:15.366 --> 00:01:17.866
I want to surprise my sister, right?

39
00:01:18.266 --> 00:01:19.600
Xiao Weiwei, what are you doing?

40
00:01:19.733 --> 00:01:20.300
Do you know

41
00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:21.866
How important this golden book is to the Qiao family

42
00:01:21.866 --> 00:01:23.066
What if something goes wrong?

43
00:01:23.733 --> 00:01:25.666
What if it goes wrong?

44
00:01:27.366 --> 00:01:29.600
Introduce Joe Weiwei

45
00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.866
Meritorious employees of our Xu Group

46
00:01:32.066 --> 00:01:35.166
The future president of the Joe Group
