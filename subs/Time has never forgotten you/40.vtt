00:00:01.466 --> 00:00:03.433
The surname Gu, you are kidding me

2
00:00:03.866 --> 00:00:05.500
I will allow you to lie to me

3
00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:06.866
Can't I fool you?

4
00:00:10.266 --> 00:00:11.700
OK.

5
00:00:11.966 --> 00:00:15.566
I do doubt you a little bit. What are you suspecting?

6
00:00:15.766 --> 00:00:17.900
I suspect you are Gu Zhenting

7
00:00:18.333 --> 00:00:22.100
And then I found out that you are not

8
00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:23.400
No, definitely not.

9
00:00:23.766 --> 00:00:26.200
I am just an ordinary migrant worker who moves bricks on a construction site

10
00:00:26.266 --> 00:00:27.733
How could he be the richest man in Haicheng?

11
00:00:27.733 --> 00:00:30.933
I just look more like Gu Zhenting.

12
00:00:30.933 --> 00:00:32.400
You look just like him

13
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:33.200
Doudou Daddy

14
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.766
Why don't you do a DNA test?

15
00:00:34.766 --> 00:00:35.366
maybe

16
00:00:35.366 --> 00:00:37.633
You are his long-lost twin brother

17
00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:38.700
Boring

18
00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:41.100
If so, you would have half of the property

19
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.066
You don't have to pretend to be the CEO to satisfy yourself

20
00:00:43.066 --> 00:00:44.333
You are really rich

21
00:00:44.333 --> 00:00:45.866
My mother only has one son.

22
00:00:45.866 --> 00:00:48.800
Then maybe you're not your own

23
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.066
Excuse me?

24
00:00:50.133 --> 00:00:51.766
Labor is out of the sky

25
00:00:51.933 --> 00:00:53.300
Have you seen Gu Chenting?

26
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:54.733
How does he feel?

27
00:00:54.733 --> 00:00:58.300
I feel he's weird. He's weird.

28
00:00:58.533 --> 00:01:00.033
Can't tell what's wrong

29
00:01:00.466 --> 00:01:02.666
And there's nothing else.

30
00:01:02.966 --> 00:01:04.800
Oh yes, let me remind you

31
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.900
You are not allowed to mention Gu Chenting in this house in the future

32
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.133
He indirectly caused me and my mother to be kicked out of the Jiang family

33
00:01:09.133 --> 00:01:10.700
I don't want to have anything to do with him.

34
00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.800
It's a pity that fate tricks people

35
00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.866
I'm still working at his company

36
00:01:16.133 --> 00:01:19.600
You brought up the Lone Pillow first, didn't you?

37
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.066
Anyway, I can't mention it to you

38
00:01:23.066 --> 00:01:25.666
Sooner or later he will know who I am

39
00:01:25.966 --> 00:01:26.733
Gotta find a way

40
00:01:26.733 --> 00:01:28.700
Let him gradually let go of his boredom with me

41
00:01:29.666 --> 00:01:30.733
What are you thinking about?

42
00:01:30.733 --> 00:01:32.466
No, nothing.

43
00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.200
Doudou is almost out of school, let's take him home, okay?
