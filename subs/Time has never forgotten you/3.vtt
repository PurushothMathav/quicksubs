00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:01.866
How many times have I told you?

2
00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:03.300
Jiang Xue is your mommy

3
00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:04.866
You must stop being unreasonable.

4
00:00:04.866 --> 00:00:06.266
No, no, no.

5
00:00:06.266 --> 00:00:07.366
Jiang Xue is a bad woman

6
00:00:07.366 --> 00:00:09.200
She's not my mommy Gu Doudou

7
00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:12.133
The poor-tempered baby is so cute

8
00:00:12.133 --> 00:00:13.266
You are also willing to be cruel to him

9
00:00:13.266 --> 00:00:14.700
How do I discipline my children?

10
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.100
It's your turn to take care of it

11
00:00:16.166 --> 00:00:18.200
Hmm, I'm biased.

12
00:00:19.166 --> 00:00:21.000
Mommy, you rent Mengbao.

13
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.133
Never rent cute treasure and husband at the same time

14
00:00:24.133 --> 00:00:24.933
force

15
00:00:25.333 --> 00:00:27.200
And my dad was poor.

16
00:00:27.266 --> 00:00:28.700
He needs this job

17
00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:31.400
Wu Doudou, enough is enough for me?

18
00:00:31.766 --> 00:00:34.766
Daddy, I don't want you to carry bricks anymore

19
00:00:34.766 --> 00:00:36.566
That's hard work.

20
00:00:38.466 --> 00:00:41.100
Ah, such a filial little cute treasure

21
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.300
I promise you.

22
00:00:42.966 --> 00:00:44.866
Five hundred days a day

23
00:00:44.966 --> 00:00:46.400
Doudou plays my son

24
00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.300
How about you play my husband?

25
00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.166
You see, I look like a brick mover.

26
00:00:50.866 --> 00:00:53.933
Depends on your outfit. Hmm?

27
00:00:53.933 --> 00:00:55.533
You're pretty smart

28
00:00:55.533 --> 00:00:56.466
But small temperament

29
00:00:56.466 --> 00:00:57.266
you

30
00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:58.933
Brick moving brother

31
00:00:58.933 --> 00:01:00.800
What you babble about is that you think there is less money.

32
00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.233
800 a day to go

33
00:01:03.466 --> 00:01:06.366
8.008 billion I don't care

34
00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.000
Daddy, 800 bucks?

35
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.866
How many bricks do you have to move to earn?

36
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.333
Go let's go home with me

37
00:01:14.333 --> 00:01:17.000
I won't arrest the little master for me

38
00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:18.400
I see who dares

39
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.966
Dad, it's not impossible for you to let me go home

40
00:01:27.066 --> 00:01:29.233
But I want Mommy, no way

41
00:01:29.566 --> 00:01:32.200
Mommy and Daddy don't want to worship your husband

42
00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.366
Grandma can't pass the pass

43
00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.300
Why don't you come home with me first?

44
00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:37.800
Let's talk about father and father together

45
00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.600
But that's where you and your dad live

46
00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.066
It's not convenient for me to go.

47
00:01:41.166 --> 00:01:43.733
If it is inconvenient for you to go, no one will protect me.

48
00:01:43.733 --> 00:01:46.866
When I go home, my father will definitely hit me

49
00:01:47.366 --> 00:01:49.400
And every time I go to see Mommy

50
00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.600
Daddy would make my butt dizzy

51
00:01:51.866 --> 00:01:52.766
It hurts.

52
00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:54.833
Is there such a thing?

53
00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:56.800
But my abusive man

54
00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.966
You can't bully the baby with me.

55
00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:00.900
Doudou, I'll go home with you
