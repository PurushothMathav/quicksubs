00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:02.600
Mr. Gu

2
00:00:04.266 --> 00:00:06.300
Are you there?

3
00:00:07.566 --> 00:00:09.300
It's okay, you don't need to explain to me.

4
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.166
Tell me when you're done, I'm looking for you.

5
00:00:11.166 --> 00:00:12.766
I'll go home and get my phone first

6
00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:15.466
Hey, what's the matter with you?

7
00:00:16.333 --> 00:00:18.833
Now let's talk about yesterday

8
00:00:19.566 --> 00:00:20.366
Oh.

9
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:21.600
Thank you.

10
00:00:22.466 --> 00:00:24.966
It's okay, you are the person I value the most

11
00:00:24.966 --> 00:00:26.100
If someone bullies you

12
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:27.066
I don't do anything.

13
00:00:27.066 --> 00:00:29.900
He doesn't seem as annoying as I had imagined.

14
00:00:31.733 --> 00:00:34.000
Mr. Gu, have you seen my boyfriend?

15
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.300
You have a boyfriend?

16
00:00:35.466 --> 00:00:37.500
I don't see anyone here.

17
00:00:37.933 --> 00:00:40.166
He also threw the electric car and this guy left

18
00:00:40.166 --> 00:00:41.666
I don't know where it went.

19
00:00:41.733 --> 00:00:42.533
Oh.

20
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.266
He might have gone home

21
00:00:45.333 --> 00:00:46.700
Or go to work

22
00:00:47.533 --> 00:00:49.000
This is a shared electric car.

23
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.766
Don't worry about it once you put it anywhere

24
00:00:50.766 --> 00:00:52.200
You could be right.

25
00:00:52.333 --> 00:00:54.300
It's possible that he had another hallucination.

26
00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.900
Rented a luxury car and left

27
00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:58.166
I can't stand spending this money.

28
00:01:07.333 --> 00:01:09.466
I sent you the video I took secretly.

29
00:01:09.466 --> 00:01:11.100
You take him to John and guess

30
00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:13.600
He will definitely break up with Gu Chenting

31
00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.000
Did Mr. Gu bring his clothes?

32
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.233
I brought it and carried it for you.

33
00:01:21.766 --> 00:01:22.600
Gu Zhengting

34
00:01:23.133 --> 00:01:26.266
Getting along with Jiang Cai Cai with fake migrant workers

35
00:01:27.166 --> 00:01:29.666
I'm afraid he'll find out that you're Gu Zhengting

36
00:01:30.066 --> 00:01:31.866
Will it reject you?

37
00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.266
The more you worry, the more I let him happen

38
00:01:36.366 --> 00:01:39.200
As long as the dishes leave you and me

39
00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.900
There is still a chance to become the young lady of the Gu family
