00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:05.800
It seems that Jiang Caicai is going to be made difficult

2
00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:07.933
I believe he can solve it.

3
00:00:07.933 --> 00:00:10.200
Mr. Gu, you are the president of Story Group

4
00:00:10.466 --> 00:00:11.800
Why didn't you tell Jiang Caicai?

5
00:00:11.966 --> 00:00:13.666
After Jiang Xue clung to me

6
00:00:13.733 --> 00:00:14.666
Fox fake tiger power

7
00:00:14.666 --> 00:00:17.166
He kicked Jiang Caicai and his mother out of the Jiang family

8
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:19.266
Although I was unaware of this

9
00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:21.366
However, Jiang Caicai has always believed that

10
00:00:21.366 --> 00:00:22.700
If it weren't for me

11
00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:25.066
He and his mother would not have been kicked out of the Jiang family

12
00:00:25.066 --> 00:00:26.366
He hates me.

13
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.900
Of course I can't reveal my identity to him

14
00:00:30.866 --> 00:00:32.966
Did you make Jiang Cai dishes?

15
00:00:32.966 --> 00:00:35.600
Hmph, I know you'll deal with me

16
00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.800
But I didn't expect you to be so impatient

17
00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:40.866
I didn't expect you to use such a pediatric way

18
00:00:40.933 --> 00:00:43.000
I really shouldn't look up to you

19
00:00:44.766 --> 00:00:46.166
Don't change the subject

20
00:00:46.166 --> 00:00:48.100
In the end, did you spill your life?

21
00:00:48.666 --> 00:00:50.366
Don't say I didn't do it

22
00:00:50.366 --> 00:00:52.566
What if I did it?

23
00:00:52.566 --> 00:00:53.766
What do you mean?

24
00:00:53.766 --> 00:00:55.200
I mean...

25
00:00:56.066 --> 00:00:58.666
What if the garbage blueprints flow out?

26
00:00:58.866 --> 00:00:59.700
You are presumptuous

27
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.600
So many of us

28
00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.666
The results of more than 3 months of work together

29
00:01:03.733 --> 00:01:05.700
You were insulted by urban garbage

30
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.566
You just don't know the sky is high

31
00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.000
I wasn't abusive.

32
00:01:09.166 --> 00:01:11.033
I saw your blueprints

33
00:01:11.066 --> 00:01:12.200
I draw

34
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.366
You can design something a hundred times more powerful than him

35
00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.800
OK, then you can change it.

36
00:01:17.133 --> 00:01:20.666
If you can't design it, get out of the company for me

37
00:01:20.666 --> 00:01:22.166
What if I could do it?

38
00:01:22.166 --> 00:01:25.066
Give me the position of director of your clothing department

39
00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.700
It's a deal.
