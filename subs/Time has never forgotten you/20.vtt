00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:01.400
You are talking nonsense.

2
00:00:01.966 --> 00:00:04.600
How could my son-in-law buy me a fake dress?

3
00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:06.200
This one of yours is fake.

4
00:00:06.266 --> 00:00:09.200
I think you are just jealous that he is richer than you.

5
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.700
New Moon, you say your son-in-law has no money, forget it

6
00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:15.200
This character is still bad

7
00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.433
You tell Cai Cai to leave him quickly

8
00:00:17.733 --> 00:00:20.333
It was your son-in-law who cheated

9
00:00:20.333 --> 00:00:22.733
Buy a counterfeit to trick your mother-in-law

10
00:00:22.733 --> 00:00:23.933
It means he has no money.

11
00:00:23.933 --> 00:00:25.266
He's pretending to be rich.

12
00:00:25.966 --> 00:00:27.233
good boy

13
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.400
You can't prove today that my clothes are fake.

14
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:30.600
I make you look good

15
00:00:33.766 --> 00:00:34.600
What's up?

16
00:00:37.166 --> 00:00:39.566
This is a picture from Story Group.

17
00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:40.900
The clothes on you

18
00:00:41.166 --> 00:00:44.233
Although the style and color are exactly the same as him

19
00:00:44.333 --> 00:00:46.600
But the pattern is different.

20
00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.500
This one is fake.

21
00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.066
This one is real.

22
00:00:52.566 --> 00:00:55.133
Auntie has always been your son-in-law

23
00:00:55.133 --> 00:00:56.700
Go back and settle the bill with him

24
00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:58.366
This unconscionable thing

25
00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.700
Knocked your mother-in-law to death

26
00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.700
Xiao Gu, where did you get this dress?

27
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.033
Mom, I have a friend who works in the story

28
00:01:12.066 --> 00:01:14.666
This is what he gave.

29
00:01:14.666 --> 00:01:18.100
Auntie, I can't accept this dress.

30
00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.866
Take it back

31
00:01:19.866 --> 00:01:20.866
No, nothing else.

32
00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.100
I've helped him a lot before, Mom.

33
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.100
Just accept what I gave you.

34
00:01:25.533 --> 00:01:26.333
that

35
00:01:26.933 --> 00:01:28.000
OK.
