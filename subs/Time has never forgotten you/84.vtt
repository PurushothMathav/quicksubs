1
00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:02.566
Then tell me

2
00:00:02.566 --> 00:00:03.466
How much do you want?

3
00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:05.733
One billion daily salary

4
00:00:05.733 --> 00:00:06.700
One hundred million

5
00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:08.300
Do you think I can afford it?

6
00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:09.766
According to my annual income

7
00:00:09.866 --> 00:00:11.500
Ask you for a daily salary of 100 million.

8
00:00:11.866 --> 00:00:13.166
It's not an exaggeration

9
00:00:13.333 --> 00:00:15.066
But what if you don't want to pay?

10
00:00:15.066 --> 00:00:15.900
It doesn't matter.

11
00:00:16.166 --> 00:00:17.466
Promise me a condition

12
00:00:17.466 --> 00:00:18.366
What kind of condition?

13
00:00:18.466 --> 00:00:19.866
Stay with the story

14
00:00:19.866 --> 00:00:21.433
Impossible why

15
00:00:21.466 --> 00:00:24.600
Gu Zhengting, don't think I have to be you

16
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.633
I can totally find a man to replace you

17
00:00:27.766 --> 00:00:29.466
In fact, it really has to be him

18
00:00:29.466 --> 00:00:30.966
My mom loves him so much

19
00:00:30.966 --> 00:00:32.933
If I tell him I've changed boyfriends

20
00:00:32.933 --> 00:00:34.400
He will also kill me

21
00:00:35.866 --> 00:00:36.666
Never mind.

22
00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.466
OK, then I promise you.

23
00:00:39.466 --> 00:00:40.500
I reply to the story

24
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.200
Just pretend to be my boyfriend and listen to me

25
00:00:43.466 --> 00:00:46.966
But you can't tell my mom that you are the richest man in Haicheng

26
00:00:47.866 --> 00:00:51.000
Why? We're so far apart.

27
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.800
If he knew you were the richest man in Haicheng

28
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.500
You will be worried that I will not be well.

29
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.433
Once you enter a wealthy family, it is as deep as the sea, understand?

30
00:00:59.766 --> 00:01:02.366
Do you care about our identity gap?

31
00:01:02.366 --> 00:01:05.800
I don't care that we broke up because you lied to me

32
00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.100
When will this hurdle pass forever

33
00:01:11.866 --> 00:01:12.766
Never mind.

34
00:01:12.966 --> 00:01:15.600
You put on your gear and accompany me to the station to pick up my mother

35
00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.100
