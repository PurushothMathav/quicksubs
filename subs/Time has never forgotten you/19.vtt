00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:02.633
His aunt saw what you said

2
00:00:02.666 --> 00:00:05.433
What does sitting on three wheels of electricity have to do with suffering?

3
00:00:06.333 --> 00:00:08.000
If he had money

4
00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:11.900
No matter how he takes a taxi, he is reluctant to take a taxi if he doesn't have the money

5
00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:13.333
That dish follows him

6
00:00:13.333 --> 00:00:15.900
It must have been suffering.

7
00:00:16.066 --> 00:00:18.433
Even if my aunt really has no money

8
00:00:18.533 --> 00:00:20.200
Guess doesn't have to suffer

9
00:00:20.266 --> 00:00:21.500
I can tell.

10
00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.600
Auntie is really nice to my daughter

11
00:00:25.166 --> 00:00:26.433
Auntie now

12
00:00:26.533 --> 00:00:28.433
Maybe the economy is a little bit worse.

13
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.133
But the young couple made their own efforts

14
00:00:31.133 --> 00:00:32.833
It's getting better.

15
00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:36.166
It's okay if Cai Cai is young and ignorant

16
00:00:36.566 --> 00:00:39.433
Qin Yue, why don't you know anything?

17
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.733
Are these days without money the days of human life?

18
00:00:42.733 --> 00:00:45.433
Look at me wearing this dress.

19
00:00:45.533 --> 00:00:47.733
My son-in-law just bought it for me

20
00:00:47.733 --> 00:00:49.366
More than 10,000 yuan a piece

21
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.433
Now that's the day.

22
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.800
Aunt, this dress looks familiar

23
00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:59.500
It's a limited edition launched by Story Group last month.

24
00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.900
Luxury goods like this

25
00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:05.100
Oh, if you have money, you may not be able to buy it.

26
00:01:05.166 --> 00:01:06.566
No channel

27
00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:07.733
Not to mention

28
00:01:07.733 --> 00:01:09.033
You have no money

29
00:01:09.866 --> 00:01:11.000
Auntie likes to show off

30
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Don't meet him

31
00:01:13.133 --> 00:01:17.166
Coincidentally, I bought one for my mom too

32
00:01:19.166 --> 00:01:21.233
Are you kidding me?

33
00:01:27.466 --> 00:01:28.266
Mom

34
00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:30.766
This is the dress I bought for you at Story Group.

35
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.366
As for the money on my aunt, it's fake
