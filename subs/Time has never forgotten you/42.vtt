00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:01.966
Ah Doudou

2
00:00:01.966 --> 00:00:03.066
Are you all right?

3
00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:05.266
Come on, get up!

4
00:00:05.266 --> 00:00:07.000
Kid, are you alright?

5
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.233
None of your business.

6
00:00:08.666 --> 00:00:09.700
My mom is curious and cares about you

7
00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:11.300
Why are you so rude?

8
00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:13.433
Apologize to my mom

9
00:00:14.066 --> 00:00:15.833
Hahahaha

10
00:00:17.466 --> 00:00:18.966
Lele, what's wrong with you?

11
00:00:18.966 --> 00:00:22.033
Mom and her family bully me

12
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:23.833
outrageous

13
00:00:24.366 --> 00:00:26.400
My son, you dare not bully me.

14
00:00:26.466 --> 00:00:29.200
Apologize Lele Mommy is like this

15
00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.366
It was Lele who pushed my son down first

16
00:00:31.366 --> 00:00:33.066
Then they both fell together

17
00:00:33.066 --> 00:00:34.166
I didn't bully your son.

18
00:00:34.166 --> 00:00:36.433
Even if my son is at fault first

19
00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:37.666
You have to apologize too

20
00:00:37.666 --> 00:00:40.333
The one who makes a mistake makes the one who didn't make a mistake apologize

21
00:00:40.333 --> 00:00:41.633
Are you being unreasonable?

22
00:00:41.666 --> 00:00:42.466
Humph

23
00:00:43.133 --> 00:00:44.566
You are a migrant worker

24
00:00:44.566 --> 00:00:46.800
What right do you have to reason with me here?

25
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.033
A migrant worker moving bricks on a construction site

26
00:00:50.166 --> 00:00:52.500
Asking you to apologize is to give you a chance.

27
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.633
Apologize obediently

28
00:00:54.666 --> 00:00:55.666
otherwise

29
00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.233
I let your son be expelled from kindergarten, believe it or not

30
00:00:59.466 --> 00:01:01.400
You are bullying and rude

31
00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.566
You run this kindergarten at home

32
00:01:03.566 --> 00:01:05.233
If you say fired, fired?
