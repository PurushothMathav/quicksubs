00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:03.200
Hey, how dare you talk to my husband like that

2
00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:04.600
Are you tired of living?

3
00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:06.466
Do you know who my husband is?

4
00:00:06.466 --> 00:00:07.766
I don't care who he is.

5
00:00:07.766 --> 00:00:10.400
He is the ancestor of the Heaven Group

6
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:11.933
My husband

7
00:00:11.933 --> 00:00:14.900
About to get an investment from Story Group

8
00:00:14.966 --> 00:00:16.266
This also means that

9
00:00:16.266 --> 00:00:17.200
My Husband

10
00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.866
He's about to get the attention of the president of stories

11
00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.866
Let alone this little kindergarten

12
00:00:23.333 --> 00:00:24.866
You don't ask

13
00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.233
This sea of big business coffee

14
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.500
Which one doesn't flatter my husband?

15
00:00:29.933 --> 00:00:32.300
This Gu Zhengting is really blind

16
00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:33.100
Steal from everyone

17
00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.566
Story Group made a total of 48 foreign investments this month

18
00:00:35.566 --> 00:00:36.866
Gu Zhengting is too busy

19
00:00:36.966 --> 00:00:38.466
It's the people below him who misread the person.

20
00:00:38.466 --> 00:00:40.333
You even know the number of investments

21
00:00:40.333 --> 00:00:42.266
How do you know so much about Story Group?

22
00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:44.266
Your driver friend told you

23
00:00:44.866 --> 00:00:46.666
Smart and bold

24
00:00:46.966 --> 00:00:48.700
Please come to the guardian of insulting Haichen

25
00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:50.166
I'm not even mad yet.

26
00:00:50.166 --> 00:00:51.066
What are you so mad about?

27
00:00:51.066 --> 00:00:53.266
Besides, you can be scolded by your own wife

28
00:00:53.266 --> 00:00:54.600
It's also a kind of happiness.

29
00:00:54.933 --> 00:00:57.600
Are you pretending to be Gu Zhenting and not afraid of getting angry?

30
00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.033
At least I can take this ill breath for my wife

31
00:01:00.333 --> 00:01:01.833
Who is your old ghost

32
00:01:01.966 --> 00:01:02.900
Shhh!

33
00:01:03.566 --> 00:01:05.866
So you are Mr. Gu

34
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.766
If it is fake, change it.

35
00:01:07.766 --> 00:01:09.433
If you were the richest man in Haicheng

36
00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.466
Then I'm the richest man in the world

37
00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.500
Migrant workers moving bricks on a construction site

38
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.000
How dare you pretend to be the richest man?

39
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.400
Hahaha, it makes people laugh out loud.

40
00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.700
There's a picture of me on Story Group's website.

41
00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.633
If you don't believe me, you can check it yourself.
