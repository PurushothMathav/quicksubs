1
00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:01.666
Go to sleep

2
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:04.366
As Party A

3
00:00:04.366 --> 00:00:07.033
It is necessary to provide a comfortable sleeping environment for Party B

4
00:00:07.066 --> 00:00:08.333
You and Doudou sleep in bed

5
00:00:08.333 --> 00:00:09.200
I lay on the floor

6
00:00:09.366 --> 00:00:10.733
You sleep in bed with Doudou

7
00:00:10.733 --> 00:00:11.566
I slept on the floor.

8
00:00:12.466 --> 00:00:14.666
How can I make my father and mother

9
00:00:14.666 --> 00:00:16.400
They're all in bed.

10
00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.633
It's late, grandma

11
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:22.700
What's wrong beanie

12
00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:26.033
I want to sleep with you. Okay?

13
00:00:28.166 --> 00:00:31.166
Auntie, what are you doing with the mattress?

14
00:00:31.166 --> 00:00:33.466
Mom is afraid that I will not sleep honestly at night.

15
00:00:33.466 --> 00:00:34.600
Fell out of bed

16
00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:35.700
So make a floor

17
00:00:36.166 --> 00:00:39.166
Wouldn't it be nice to let my aunt sleep outside in several lifetimes?

18
00:00:40.133 --> 00:00:41.566
Ah ah ok

19
00:00:41.566 --> 00:00:43.133
Go to sleep

20
00:00:43.133 --> 00:00:46.500
Many children and many blessings let me hold a grandson

21
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.500
Grandchildren can do it

22
00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:49.566
Mom doesn't pick

23
00:00:49.566 --> 00:00:54.500
I don't pick Mom either, I don't want him to cheer

24
00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:55.800
Come on.

25
00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:00.400
Excuse me?

26
00:01:00.733 --> 00:01:02.200
Old people are like this

27
00:01:04.066 --> 00:01:06.466
I thought so.

28
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:09.666
What do you want?

29
00:01:12.966 --> 00:01:13.966
What are you doing?

30
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:15.633
What do you think?
