00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:01.400
How much are the watermelons?

2
00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:03.033
50 cents a jin is good.

3
00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.733
Doudou eat less

4
00:00:07.733 --> 00:00:08.566
Don't overeat

5
00:00:08.566 --> 00:00:10.000
Got it, Daddy.

6
00:00:10.733 --> 00:00:12.433
Watermelons are sold

7
00:00:12.766 --> 00:00:15.766
Selling watermelons is not sweet and costs no money.

8
00:00:16.666 --> 00:00:18.766
Ouch, come and buy it.

9
00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.166
Come and buy watermelon

10
00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:22.500
Stop shouting

11
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.800
I see your voice is hoarse. Take a sip of water.

12
00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:28.466
Hot hmm

13
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.500
Girls can't drink cold during menstruation, thank you.

14
00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:40.866
Let me ask you a question.

15
00:00:40.866 --> 00:00:44.133
Where is Doudou's biological mother?

16
00:00:44.133 --> 00:00:46.266
Died when Doudou was very young

17
00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:50.433
Dead, right, no wonder he wants someone else to be a mommy

18
00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:51.533
You are no one else

19
00:00:51.533 --> 00:00:53.666
In Doudou's heart, you are his real mommy

20
00:00:53.666 --> 00:00:55.066
So you must be nice to him.

21
00:00:55.133 --> 00:00:57.033
I will. Don't worry.

22
00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:58.133
You know

23
00:00:58.133 --> 00:00:59.466
I lost a child

24
00:00:59.466 --> 00:01:00.666
So I will definitely

25
00:01:00.666 --> 00:01:02.333
Treat Doudou like his own child

26
00:01:02.333 --> 00:01:03.366
I'm becoming more and more certain

27
00:01:03.366 --> 00:01:05.033
You are Doudou's real mommy

28
00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.200
Paternity test is coming soon

29
00:01:07.366 --> 00:01:09.200
Everything will come to light

30
00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.366
You go to rest first

31
00:01:10.366 --> 00:01:11.433
I'll help you shout

32
00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.066
You help me shout

33
00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:14.400
It won't sell.

34
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.600
Why do you say so?

35
00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.666
Because you don't look like a watermelon seller.

36
00:01:18.666 --> 00:01:20.400
What do I look like?

37
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.600
CEO

38
00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.966
Why can't the CEO sell watermelons?

39
00:01:23.966 --> 00:01:25.366
You don't understand this

40
00:01:25.466 --> 00:01:26.800
Are you shopping in the countryside?

41
00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.600
It's about being down to earth

42
00:01:28.666 --> 00:01:30.966
I sell watermelons. I sell watermelons.

43
00:01:32.466 --> 00:01:34.900
Brother Brick Moving, didn't I laugh at you?

44
00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:36.866
Your voice is as quiet as a mosquito

45
00:01:36.866 --> 00:01:38.100
Who will buy our watermelon?

46
00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.900
Wow
