He seems to have said to give it to me for free haha.

7
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:19.700
What's going on?

8
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:20.966
I don't know.

9
00:00:21.366 --> 00:00:23.800
Free delivery won't recognize you, right?

10
00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:24.666
This is your industry

11
00:00:24.666 --> 00:00:26.666
There are too many stores under the name.

12
00:00:29.333 --> 00:00:31.900
We send it for free because you are a customer.

13
00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.866
It's because you are the lucky customer.

14
00:00:35.133 --> 00:00:36.500

16
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.666
Give away a piece of jewelry worth less than 300,000

17
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.866
You are the lucky customer of the year

18
00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.433
Is it vegetable?

19
00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:47.766
Did you see that?

20
00:00:47.766 --> 00:00:50.566
Your mom is lucky today, haha.

21
00:00:50.566 --> 00:00:52.000
I see it, I see it.

22
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.766
Then you wrap it up for my mom.

23
00:01:05.133 --> 00:01:08.733
Hey, this is Mrs. Jiang's mother

24
00:01:08.733 --> 00:01:09.566
Yes

25
00:01:10.266 --> 00:01:13.166

26
00:01:13.166 --> 00:01:16.100

00:01:18.333 --> 00:01:20.166
Mrs. Jiang must not succeed

29
00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.866
The position of this young lady is yours

30
00:01:23.566 --> 00:01:24.366
OK

31
00:01:25.466 --> 00:01:28.266
I have to figure out a way not to see him

32
00:01:33.533 --> 00:01:34.766
Do something for me.
