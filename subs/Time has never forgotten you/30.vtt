00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.133
Take the improvised junk

2
00:00:02.133 --> 00:00:05.066
Compared to what we spent three months working on

3
00:00:05.066 --> 00:00:07.000
Hmph, I don't know how high the sky is

4
00:00:07.266 --> 00:00:08.533
pretend

5
00:00:08.533 --> 00:00:10.733
If you don't die, you won't die.

6
00:00:10.733 --> 00:00:13.000
I have a habit when I create

7
00:00:13.466 --> 00:00:15.166
I just can't hear a dog barking.

8
00:00:15.166 --> 00:00:17.600
If you keep barking

9
00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:18.800
Then I have to stop.

10
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.200
You shut up

11
00:00:20.733 --> 00:00:22.166
Leave him alone.

12
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.700
I'm going to convince him what he said

13
00:00:25.066 --> 00:00:27.566
Pay for your own arrogance and ignorance

14
00:00:31.466 --> 00:00:33.900
Although Miss Jiang is known as a talented designer

15
00:00:34.166 --> 00:00:35.866
But this scene design

16
00:00:36.366 --> 00:00:37.500
Difficulty is not small

17
00:00:46.533 --> 00:00:48.633
Are you questioning his ability?

18
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:49.966
Not really. No, actually.

19
00:01:02.566 --> 00:01:05.966
Which one of your works is good, I don't need to say more

20
00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:08.300
Jiangcai Cuisine

21
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.266
What do you know about aesthetics?

22
00:01:11.766 --> 00:01:14.633
Just your kind of unglamorous rubbish design

23
00:01:14.733 --> 00:01:16.300
How do you match it?

24
00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:17.533
You said he was trash.

25
00:01:17.533 --> 00:01:19.066
Garbage

26
00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.866
Then you'd better listen to everyone's opinion.

27
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.500
Their opinion is exactly the same as mine

28
00:01:25.733 --> 00:01:29.400
Your costume design is so ugly

29
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.166
He only deserves to be thrown into the trash can.

30
00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.266
Don't be impulsive
