00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:11.166
Everybody.

2
00:00:11.166 --> 00:00:13.600
Give me this moment your happiest scream

3
00:00:38.166 --> 00:00:39.133
Are you happy?

4
00:00:39.133 --> 00:00:42.200
Happy Doudou I want to play the carousel

5
00:00:42.733 --> 00:00:45.100
But merry-go-rounds are a hit.

6
00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:47.000
There must be a lot of people in line

7
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.666
Do you have to be prepared to queue up?

8
00:00:49.666 --> 00:00:50.733
How long will it take?

9
00:00:50.733 --> 00:00:53.266
That's at least an hour

10
00:00:53.866 --> 00:00:56.400
Let's go. What a long queue!

11
00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.000
I guess I'm not going to go then.

12
00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.500
Sore legs standing

13
00:00:59.533 --> 00:01:02.133
This is your first time bringing Doudou to the playground

14
00:01:02.133 --> 00:01:03.966
Maybe God will bless us

15
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:05.500
Maybe there aren't that many people in line.

16
00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:06.700
Daddy is right

17
00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.366
Go play the carousel

18
00:01:08.366 --> 00:01:12.666
Hahaha, brother brick moving, this is feudal superstition.

19
00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:14.333
There were so many people on the merry-go-round

20
00:01:14.333 --> 00:01:16.066
Duoduo will be unhappy to see it.

21
00:01:16.066 --> 00:01:16.733
How could I possibly

22
00:01:16.733 --> 00:01:18.066
Will it make our son unhappy?

23
00:01:18.066 --> 00:01:18.866
Come on.

24
00:01:19.866 --> 00:01:21.000
What are you doing?

25
00:01:22.533 --> 00:01:24.366
Hey, you take advantage of me

26
00:01:25.966 --> 00:01:28.833
What relatives? Look at this. Ouch.

27
00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:30.700
Who is this guy?

28
00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.600
Money is sent, money is sent.
