00:00:04.533 --> 00:00:06.800
So far you seem to be doing well

2
00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:08.200
But don't be proud.

3
00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:09.800
You have to get him to completely approve of you

4
00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:11.066
But I think

5
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:14.800
Your mother has completely approved of me, that's what you think

6
00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:16.300
Still have to perform well

7
00:00:17.066 --> 00:00:17.866
For example

8
00:00:19.466 --> 00:00:23.266
For example, even if you think my mother's cooking is not delicious

9
00:00:23.266 --> 00:00:23.900
But

10
00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:25.966
Don't make it look like it's hard to swallow

11
00:00:25.966 --> 00:00:26.933
My usual drink

12
00:00:26.933 --> 00:00:29.433
The food is prepared by a dedicated senior chef

13
00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.100
I'm not used to what other people do

14
00:00:31.333 --> 00:00:32.866
You make me pretend

15
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:34.566
I'm not good at it.

16
00:00:34.566 --> 00:00:36.066
If you are not good at

17
00:00:36.066 --> 00:00:37.800
You wouldn't be impersonating the president

18
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.100
Take out your three-kilometer and you'll get it done

19
00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:41.166
I believe you.

20
00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:42.300
Excuse me.

21
00:00:42.333 --> 00:00:43.266
I'm not interested.

22
00:00:44.166 --> 00:00:45.733
You really hurt me, didn't you?

23
00:00:45.733 --> 00:00:47.166
Be careful I deduct your wages

24
00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:51.566
Once Mommy and Daddy eat an unpalatable meal

25
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.200
You can't help but spit it out

26
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.566
He really can't help with this job

27
00:00:57.266 --> 00:00:58.700
Brick moving brother

28
00:00:58.733 --> 00:01:00.900
What kind of quirk are you?

29
00:01:01.133 --> 00:01:02.900
At least you killed it

30
00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:04.600
If you make my mom unhappy

31
00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.466
He will let me save my family order

32
00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.166
Xiao Gu, try your mother's cooking

33
00:01:10.933 --> 00:01:11.900
Eat while it's hot

34
00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:14.466
i

35
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.833
Don't vomit, hold back
