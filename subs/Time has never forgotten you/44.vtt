00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:01.566
What to check

2
00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:03.866
You can't be Mr. Gu at all

3
00:00:03.866 --> 00:00:06.633
Pretty clown, give me your phone

4
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:12.600
Here it is.

5
00:00:20.466 --> 00:00:21.800
Are you really Mr. Gu?

6
00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.366
I don't like to talk nonsense

7
00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.333
Mr. Gu, we didn't know it was you.

8
00:00:26.333 --> 00:00:27.500
We were wrong.

9
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:28.800
You have a lot.

10
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.600
Don't you know us in general?

11
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.066
Did you just

12
00:00:32.666 --> 00:00:34.566
Say you want me to apologize?

13
00:00:34.566 --> 00:00:35.466
No no no no

14
00:00:35.733 --> 00:00:38.633
I'm talking nonsense, haha, Mr. Gu

15
00:00:38.733 --> 00:00:41.833
Why are you dressed like this?

16
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.600
Your family's status in Haicheng is as humble as ants

17
00:00:45.733 --> 00:00:47.200
What right do you have to ask me?

18
00:00:47.266 --> 00:00:48.933
Hey, Mr. Gu, oops.

19
00:00:48.933 --> 00:00:50.300
I was wrong.

20
00:00:50.333 --> 00:00:51.866
Act vividly

21
00:00:51.866 --> 00:00:54.000
Are you fake?

22
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.033
Dare to bully my wife and son

23
00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:57.566
Apologize to them immediately

24
00:00:58.166 --> 00:00:59.166
Hahaha

25
00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.033
Young lady, young master, wait a minute

26
00:01:04.066 --> 00:01:07.666
Mr. Gu is the richest man in Haicheng

27
00:01:07.666 --> 00:01:09.100
That's the best

28
00:01:09.366 --> 00:01:12.433
How can it be possible to wear Minggong clothes?

29
00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:17.400
So you are not Mr. Gu's husband at all

30
00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.000
Don't talk nonsense.

31
00:01:19.133 --> 00:01:21.500
The person on the official website just now was obviously him

32
00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.966
He just looks exactly like Mr. Gu
