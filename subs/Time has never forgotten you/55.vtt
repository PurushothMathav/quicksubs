00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:06.033
Um, let me interview you

2
00:00:06.133 --> 00:00:09.800
What is it like to be in a relationship with someone you dislike?

3
00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:11.733
What annoying person

4
00:00:11.733 --> 00:00:13.066
Don't look for trouble.

5
00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:15.166
Do you really think your him

6
00:00:15.166 --> 00:00:16.400
Just a migrant worker.

7
00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.433
He is Gu Zhenting

8
00:00:18.766 --> 00:00:21.833
I borrowed it from him five years ago

9
00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.333
So that you and your mother can be easily kicked out

10
00:00:25.333 --> 00:00:26.733
You think too much

11
00:00:26.733 --> 00:00:28.066
My boyfriend just happens to be

12
00:00:28.066 --> 00:00:29.800
It's exactly the same as Mr. Gu's

13
00:00:29.933 --> 00:00:31.700
I knew you didn't believe me.

14
00:00:32.166 --> 00:00:34.233
Gu Zhenting has been lying to you

15
00:00:34.466 --> 00:00:38.000
I never took you seriously. I don't believe it.

16
00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:41.500
See for yourself

17
00:00:56.466 --> 00:00:57.366
Ask you something

18
00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:58.100
You said Mr. Hu

19
00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.833
You said if I don't wear the clothes of migrant workers

20
00:01:00.966 --> 00:01:03.000
How can I become unlike the guzheng?

21
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.966
Simple, plastic surgery

22
00:01:05.733 --> 00:01:08.433
Hahaha, joking, joking.

23
00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:13.033
Hurry up, can't think of a way to halve the salary?

24
00:01:14.733 --> 00:01:16.800
If there is any injury, it is always a panic.

25
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.600
Hmph, I thought of Mr. Gu

26
00:01:20.666 --> 00:01:21.900
For example, you and you are now

27
00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.066
Wouldn't all the habits be reversed?

28
00:01:24.533 --> 00:01:25.333
For example

29
00:01:26.166 --> 00:01:27.033
For example

30
00:01:27.166 --> 00:01:29.633
For example, is your posture more correct now?

31
00:01:29.666 --> 00:01:30.500
Agreement he

32
00:01:31.066 --> 00:01:32.200
Right, right.

33
00:01:32.666 --> 00:01:34.466
To the right, yeah.

34
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.500
Perfect. That's it.

35
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.800
Yes, is that so?

36
00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:41.400
More perfect

37
00:01:41.733 --> 00:01:44.000
That's it.

38
00:01:44.166 --> 00:01:45.500
That's a good idea.

39
00:01:45.933 --> 00:01:48.200
Gu Zhengting, you lied to me.
