00:00:05.466 --> 00:00:07.100
Oh, my God.

2
00:00:07.766 --> 00:00:11.033
These women approach me for more and more reasons

3
00:00:11.366 --> 00:00:13.200
As long as he realizes that I have no money

4
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.700
He will leave immediately

5
00:00:15.966 --> 00:00:18.066
Daddy, you've come to the wrong place

6
00:00:18.066 --> 00:00:20.166
This is not our home

7
00:00:20.333 --> 00:00:22.233
If we really take him to our house

8
00:00:22.333 --> 00:00:24.966
Doesn't he know you lied to him?

9
00:00:25.066 --> 00:00:28.066
Daddy moves bricks, how can he live in a big villa?

10
00:00:28.066 --> 00:00:29.766
Daddy's thoughtful

11
00:00:31.666 --> 00:00:33.666
So this is your home?

12
00:00:34.333 --> 00:00:36.466
Yep. Monthly rent 1,500.

13
00:00:36.666 --> 00:00:37.800
How are you feeling?

14
00:00:38.733 --> 00:00:39.866
feel

15
00:00:41.166 --> 00:00:42.466
Really bad.

16
00:00:43.266 --> 00:00:44.300
So you're leaving?

17
00:00:44.666 --> 00:00:46.100
Dirty and messy

18
00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.400
Children live in this environment for a long time

19
00:00:48.466 --> 00:00:49.866
There will be problems with the body

20
00:00:49.866 --> 00:00:51.766
I would also like to take him to live in a big villa

21
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.766
But no money

22
00:00:53.766 --> 00:00:55.966
It's not about the money.

23
00:00:55.966 --> 00:00:58.366
The point is dirty

24
00:01:03.666 --> 00:01:04.633
What do you want?

25
00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.666
Nonsense, of course it's cleaning.

26
00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.200
Mommy, you are so cool.

27
00:01:44.066 --> 00:01:46.566
Mr. Gu, can I mention one for you?

28
00:01:46.566 --> 00:01:48.000
A little suggestion.

29
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.233
Speak up

30
00:01:49.866 --> 00:01:53.400
It's just that you don't always work hard to pretend to be a big president

31
00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.366
If you have nothing to do in this house, pack it up.

32
00:01:55.366 --> 00:01:58.033
Such a dirty environment is not good for children's health

33
00:02:00.066 --> 00:02:01.666
Ah, and there's more.

34
00:02:01.666 --> 00:02:03.666
When will you agree?

35
00:02:03.666 --> 00:02:04.966
I'm taking Doudou back to the countryside

36
00:02:04.966 --> 00:02:06.166
Anyway.

37
00:02:06.266 --> 00:02:07.900
Never let him take Doudou away

38
00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.266
Do you particularly want to take Doudou home?

39
00:02:12.666 --> 00:02:14.966
Um no yes or no

40
00:02:14.966 --> 00:02:16.300
Precisely

41
00:02:16.733 --> 00:02:18.900
You and I want to take it home too

42
00:02:18.933 --> 00:02:20.300
You have a big appetite.

43
00:02:20.733 --> 00:02:22.433
My appetite is not small

44
00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.466
Do you know why I blocked

45
00:02:24.466 --> 00:02:25.800
Don't worry

46
00:02:25.966 --> 00:02:28.666
Don't worry because you don't know enough

47
00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.166
Well, Jiang Caicai is 23 years old

48
00:02:32.166 --> 00:02:33.300
Bachelor's degree

49
00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:34.533
Fashion design major

50
00:02:34.533 --> 00:02:36.166
Height 170 Bust

51
00:02:38.533 --> 00:02:39.366
rogue
