1
00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.466
In front of Jiang Xue

2
00:00:02.733 --> 00:00:04.633
It's not convenient for me to tell him things

3
00:00:05.366 --> 00:00:06.633
Zhengting brother

4
00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:08.633
I'll be your wife soon

5
00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.666
The fact that he hit me

6
00:00:10.666 --> 00:00:12.600
If you don't get me justice

7
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.466
It will also damage your reputation if it is spread out.

8
00:00:17.066 --> 00:00:17.866
How come?

9
00:00:17.866 --> 00:00:20.400
Your fiancee is firing me

10
00:00:20.966 --> 00:00:23.066
Jiang Caicai is the director of the clothing department

11
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.766
What qualifications do you have to fire him?

12
00:00:24.766 --> 00:00:26.500
I'm your fiancee

13
00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:27.700
Brother Zhenting

14
00:00:27.733 --> 00:00:30.100
I don't even have that right? You don't.

15
00:00:30.766 --> 00:00:31.566
apologize

16
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.700
You asked me to apologize to him

17
00:00:36.866 --> 00:00:38.766
I suggest you do the same

18
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.233
Sorry, I'm a little deaf.

19
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:46.800
Can't hear you clearly?

20
00:00:47.466 --> 00:00:48.700
Louder

21
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:51.500
Sorry.

22
00:00:52.133 --> 00:00:52.966
Yes, I do.

23
00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.433
I'm sorry for pretending to be a tiger in front of me

24
00:00:58.533 --> 00:00:59.766
You did it yourself

25
00:00:59.766 --> 00:01:00.966
Where did you get my file?

26
00:01:00.966 --> 00:01:03.000
Where are you going to put it back?

27
00:01:10.966 --> 00:01:11.766
Vegetables

28
00:01:12.366 --> 00:01:14.500
You don't have to explain my marriage to me

29
00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:17.766
The reason why you stayed in the story

30
00:01:18.133 --> 00:01:20.266
Is it because you still have me in your heart?

31
00:01:21.666 --> 00:01:23.200
narcissism

32
00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:26.333
I have a clear separation of work and life

33
00:01:26.333 --> 00:01:27.333
You are my boss.

34
00:01:27.333 --> 00:01:28.600
We broke up.

35
00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.966
Doesn't mean I'm leaving. Bye.

36
00:01:32.733 --> 00:01:35.900
I have to explain the marriage to him
