00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:01.833
What's the matter?

2
00:00:01.933 --> 00:00:04.566
Don't worry, Mom won't do anything to him.

3
00:00:04.566 --> 00:00:05.900
Mom is waiting for him at home

4
00:00:07.866 --> 00:00:09.000
My mom wants to see you

5
00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:10.066
I heard it.

6
00:00:10.066 --> 00:00:12.000
If you don't want to go, then don't go.

7
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.266
Your mother seems to have misunderstood me.

8
00:00:14.266 --> 00:00:16.633
I just took this opportunity to explain to her

9
00:00:16.733 --> 00:00:18.200
She is your mother after all

10
00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:19.300
My future mother-in-law

11
00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:20.666
OK, then you go first

12
00:00:20.666 --> 00:00:21.600
I have another meeting

13
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.666
I'll find you then.

14
00:00:28.733 --> 00:00:30.000
The money in it

15
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.766
Enough for your life

16
00:00:33.333 --> 00:00:34.400
He's all yours.

17
00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.600
Auntie, I'm with Zhenting

18
00:00:37.066 --> 00:00:37.766
Don't ask for money

19
00:00:37.766 --> 00:00:41.100
Before, I thought you were greedy for the town court's money

20
00:00:41.333 --> 00:00:42.366
Now I know.

21
00:00:42.366 --> 00:00:44.600
Do you really like Zhenting?

22
00:00:45.566 --> 00:00:46.766
But except for money

23
00:00:47.066 --> 00:00:50.433
I don't have a better way to compensate.

24
00:00:51.466 --> 00:00:52.266
Guess

25
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.866
You're fine, but I have better options

26
00:00:56.866 --> 00:00:59.666
I was a victim of the past

27
00:00:59.666 --> 00:01:01.866
I know that as a woman

28
00:01:01.966 --> 00:01:03.600
I feel sorry for you too.

29
00:01:04.766 --> 00:01:06.033
But we take care of the family

30
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.700
It is not allowed to marry a woman who has ruined her innocence

31
00:01:11.266 --> 00:01:13.166
Zhenting is not an ordinary person

32
00:01:13.333 --> 00:01:14.966
He was a man of power.

33
00:01:15.133 --> 00:01:17.466
His every word, every line

34
00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.700
All represent the Storytelling Group

35
00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.166
I don't want to be with you because of him

36
00:01:22.166 --> 00:01:24.500
The story group is criticized

37
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.766
Auntie is here this time

38
00:01:26.766 --> 00:01:28.400
I just want to explain it to you.

39
00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.766
I won't break up with him because of what happened back then

40
00:01:30.933 --> 00:01:32.233
It's someone else's fault

41
00:01:32.533 --> 00:01:35.066
Not me. I have nothing to blame

42
00:01:35.166 --> 00:01:38.333
I am also entitled to a perfect love

43
00:01:38.333 --> 00:01:41.366
So you shouldn't hold on to this matter either.

44
00:01:41.366 --> 00:01:42.466
Stop us
