00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.500
No, no, brother

2
00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:04.166
You see

3
00:00:04.166 --> 00:00:05.933
For the sake of giving birth to a child for you

4
00:00:05.933 --> 00:00:07.266
Please forgive me.

5
00:00:07.333 --> 00:00:08.466
Forgive me.

6
00:00:09.533 --> 00:00:11.066
You still have the face to mention Doudou

7
00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:13.866
Doudou doesn't recognize you at all now

8
00:00:13.966 --> 00:00:16.166
It means that you are not good to him at all

9
00:00:16.166 --> 00:00:18.400
I am Doudou's biological mother

10
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.466
How could I treat him badly?

11
00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.633
It's because I'm usually too strict with him.

12
00:00:23.666 --> 00:00:26.100
It destroyed the mother-son relationship between us

13
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:27.233
I listen to my brother

14
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.300
Doudou is my own flesh and blood

15
00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:30.766
I can't afford to lose him.

16
00:00:30.766 --> 00:00:32.000
As a mother

17
00:00:32.966 --> 00:00:34.000
You failed.

18
00:00:34.366 --> 00:00:37.033
Ginger cabbage is a better mother for Doudou than you are

19
00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.900
Doudou was raised by me through hard work

20
00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.066
You can't do that.

21
00:00:42.533 --> 00:00:44.966
You brought it all on yourself

22
00:00:45.166 --> 00:00:47.233
There is no room for negotiation on this matter.

23
00:00:47.666 --> 00:00:49.733
I miss you and Doudou mother and son

24
00:00:49.733 --> 00:00:51.700
Before Mrs. Jiang took care of the house

25
00:00:51.766 --> 00:00:53.200
I can leave you alone.

26
00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.100
Just listen to my brother

27
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.666
Either you agree

28
00:00:56.966 --> 00:00:58.766
Or you can leave now

29
00:01:01.133 --> 00:01:02.300
Yeah, I agree.

30
00:01:05.166 --> 00:01:07.866
The wine and dishes are all because of you

31
00:01:07.933 --> 00:01:09.633
I can't live without you

32
00:01:17.533 --> 00:01:19.100
Daddy Doudou, where are you?

33
00:01:19.266 --> 00:01:21.666
I am at home

34
00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:25.600
It's okay, I'll just ask and hang up.

35
00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.966
Well, you are not the richest man in Haicheng

36
00:01:32.066 --> 00:01:33.100
You forgot

37
00:01:33.133 --> 00:01:35.733
Why am I Jiang Xuewu, the one who moved bricks?

38
00:01:35.733 --> 00:01:36.100
he

39
00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:38.433
So that you don't even recognize your boyfriend?

40
00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.566
It is precisely because I look like Gu Zhenting

41
00:01:40.566 --> 00:01:42.166
That's why I started impersonating him

42
00:01:42.166 --> 00:01:43.133
dressing style

43
00:01:43.133 --> 00:01:43.800
Walking posture

44
00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.333
Even the tone of voice

45
00:01:45.333 --> 00:01:47.200
I've learned to make it difficult for others to distinguish between true and false

46
00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.266
But he also mistook his own child

47
00:01:50.266 --> 00:01:52.000
I look like Gu Zhenting

48
00:01:52.066 --> 00:01:54.100
Doudou looks like the young master of Story Group

49
00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:55.033
Not surprising.

50
00:01:55.266 --> 00:01:58.400
Well, I always feel weird about Gu Zhengting

51
00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:59.900
Are you really Doudou Daddy?

52
00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:01.366
I must find out
