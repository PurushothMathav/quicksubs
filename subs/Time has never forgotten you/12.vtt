1
00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.233
I really support you

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.500
Mrs. Jiang is probably Doudou's biological mother

3
00:00:04.866 --> 00:00:06.566
He has an aversion to stubborn men

4
00:00:06.566 --> 00:00:08.100
I can't reveal my identity for now

5
00:00:09.533 --> 00:00:11.033
What's wrong with Mr. Gu?

6
00:00:11.166 --> 00:00:12.633
You've got the wrong person.

7
00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:13.900
I am not Mr. Gu

8
00:00:15.566 --> 00:00:18.066
Manager Sun, you came just in time.

9
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.766
Director Jiang, he won't let me join Story Group

10
00:00:23.066 --> 00:00:23.866
Oh.

11
00:00:24.933 --> 00:00:26.366
Director Jiang

12
00:00:26.366 --> 00:00:29.266
Miss Coco is a day that Mr. Gu attaches great importance to

13
00:00:29.266 --> 00:00:30.866
How could you drive him away?

14
00:00:30.866 --> 00:00:33.900
Coco, he is the famous designer Coco.

15
00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:35.600
I told you

16
00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:36.500
You can't drive away

17
00:00:36.966 --> 00:00:37.600
You come out

18
00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:38.700
I need to ask you something.

19
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.433
You are not the richest man in Haicheng

20
00:00:50.533 --> 00:00:52.666
You forget I move bricks

21
00:00:52.666 --> 00:00:54.166
Why did Jiang Xue

22
00:00:54.766 --> 00:00:56.500
You can't even admit that your boyfriend is wrong, right?

23
00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.633
It is precisely because I look like Gu Zhenting

24
00:00:59.066 --> 00:01:00.666
That's why I started impersonating him

25
00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:01.766
dressing style

26
00:01:01.766 --> 00:01:02.466
Walking posture

27
00:01:02.466 --> 00:01:03.933
Even the tone of voice

28
00:01:03.933 --> 00:01:05.666
I've learned to make it difficult for others to distinguish between true and false

29
00:01:05.666 --> 00:01:08.566
But he also mistook his own child

30
00:01:08.566 --> 00:01:10.366
I look like Gu Zhenting

31
00:01:10.566 --> 00:01:12.800
Doudou looks like the young master of Story Group

32
00:01:12.933 --> 00:01:13.800
Not surprising.

33
00:01:13.866 --> 00:01:16.566
Well, I always feel weird

34
00:01:17.866 --> 00:01:20.766
Mommy, if my daddy was a rich man

35
00:01:20.966 --> 00:01:23.200
How can you live in a crappy house?

36
00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.633
Move bricks to the hand pumping machine every day

37
00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:28.233
That's true!

38
00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:29.666
Mr. Gu

39
00:01:29.766 --> 00:01:31.933
Why did you bring Doudou to Story Group?

40
00:01:31.933 --> 00:01:34.700
I have a friend who is Gu Zhenting's driver

41
00:01:34.933 --> 00:01:36.333
Doudou likes to play with him very much

42
00:01:36.333 --> 00:01:37.866
Doudou said he missed him today

43
00:01:37.866 --> 00:01:39.933
So I brought Doudou to him

44
00:01:39.933 --> 00:01:41.700
I hate him the most

45
00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:43.966
At that time, Jiang Xue could not climb Gu Zhenting

46
00:01:43.966 --> 00:01:46.100
No one will dare not listen to him in the future

47
00:01:46.866 --> 00:01:49.566
My mom and I were quickly kicked out of the house by him

48
00:01:49.666 --> 00:01:50.966
If not for the government office

49
00:01:51.133 --> 00:01:53.166
My mom and I wouldn't have been so miserable back then

50
00:01:53.333 --> 00:01:55.633
I hate him, the bad things are done by Jiang Xue

51
00:01:55.666 --> 00:01:56.966
What's the matter with taking care of Zhengting?

52
00:01:56.966 --> 00:01:58.633
Why doesn't it matter?

53
00:01:58.733 --> 00:02:01.200
If it weren't for Gu Zhengting, I wouldn't be so miserable

54
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.533
You are not Gu Zhengting

55
00:02:03.533 --> 00:02:04.833
Why are you speaking for him?
