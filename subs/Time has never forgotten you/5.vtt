Height 170 Bust

2
00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:05.100
rogue

3
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.300
How long do you plan to take Doudou back to the countryside?

4
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.933
It's going to take a month anyway

5
00:00:11.933 --> 00:00:13.266
So long?

6
00:00:13.366 --> 00:00:15.400
Do you have enough financial means?

7
00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:16.566
Take care of Doudou

8
00:00:16.766 --> 00:00:17.400
Daddy

9
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.966
It doesn't cost much if the consumption in the countryside is low.

10
00:00:19.966 --> 00:00:22.800
You can't live a hard life even if your spending is low

11
00:00:22.933 --> 00:00:25.333
Don't force yourself to come out and make money

12
00:00:25.333 --> 00:00:28.233
He's having a hard time. What did you say?

13
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.166
Nothing, don't worry.

14
00:00:30.166 --> 00:00:31.400
I have 50,000 savings

15
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:32.800
It's okay to take care of Doudou

16
00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.866
50,000 also called deposits

17
00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:37.066
Miss Choke, you are financially incapable

18
00:00:37.066 --> 00:00:38.200
Can't take care of Doudou

19
00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:39.933
I don't trust you with the child.

20
00:00:39.933 --> 00:00:41.400
Then tell me a number.

21
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:42.433
By how much?

22
00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:44.166
At least 100,000

23
00:00:44.166 --> 00:00:46.800
100,000 make 50,000 more

24
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:47.866
You give me a day.

25
00:00:47.866 --> 00:00:50.033
You are not afraid of the wind flashing your tongue

26
00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:52.300
Just wait and see.

27
00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:53.700
If you can't do it

28
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.566
I will disappear into Doudou's world forever

29
00:00:56.566 --> 00:00:58.000
But if I do

30
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.433
You have to come home with me and play my husband

31
00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:01.500
It's a deal.

32
00:01:02.566 --> 00:01:04.566
I was recently hired by Story Group.

33
00:01:04.566 --> 00:01:06.066
You're going to lose.

34
00:01:13.166 --> 00:01:15.600
And there it is, StoryCorps.

35
00:01:20.133 --> 00:01:21.066
wooden dad

36
00:01:22.733 --> 00:01:23.800
What's he doing here?

37
00:01:31.733 --> 00:01:34.233
What did you just call me dad?

38
00:01:35.266 --> 00:01:37.633
I mean Gu Doudou's father

39
00:01:38.066 --> 00:01:40.966
Why are you pretending to be the president again?

40
00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:43.333
Oh, right.

41
00:01:43.333 --> 00:01:45.266
I don't know your name yet.

42
00:01:45.266 --> 00:01:46.533
It's not necessary.

43
00:01:46.533 --> 00:01:49.433
After today, there is no intersection between us.

44
00:01:49.933 --> 00:01:51.366
Don't get too proud

45
00:01:51.366 --> 00:01:53.433
I may not fail the Story Group interview

46
00:01:57.266 --> 00:01:58.933
You are coming to Story Group for an interview

47
00:01:58.933 --> 00:01:59.733
Right.

48
00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:02.366
Story Group is the most powerful company in Haicheng

49
00:02:02.366 --> 00:02:04.666
Only he can afford the salary I want

50
00:02:04.666 --> 00:02:06.600
Then you know a company strength bridge

51
00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:07.866
Does it mean anything?

52
00:02:07.866 --> 00:02:10.366
Means more than money

53
00:02:11.133 --> 00:02:12.900
Means a high elimination rate

54
00:02:20.166 --> 00:02:22.000
Who do you look down on?
