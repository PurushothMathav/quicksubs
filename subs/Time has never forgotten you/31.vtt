1
00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:06.666
Miss Jiang's design is simply ingenious

2
00:00:06.666 --> 00:00:07.666
unique

3
00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:10.000
It's absolutely breathtaking.

4
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.100
If you bring his finished product to the market

5
00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:13.033
It will be hot

6
00:00:13.466 --> 00:00:14.433
Pardon me?

7
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.566
Jiang Zijian's design

8
00:00:16.566 --> 00:00:18.600
Compare our designs to the dead

9
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.166
Can't you see?

10
00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.933
You know, it took us three months.

11
00:00:22.933 --> 00:00:24.233
And Miss Jiang

12
00:00:24.733 --> 00:00:26.200
It only took a few minutes

13
00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.500
We don't even deserve to carry his shoes.

14
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.300
And I proposed to take it and turn it into a finished product and put it on the market.

15
00:00:31.333 --> 00:00:32.333
I also propose

16
00:00:32.333 --> 00:00:33.300
I agree. I agree.

17
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.000
I agree. I agree.

18
00:00:35.133 --> 00:00:36.400
You you

19
00:00:36.566 --> 00:00:37.300
you

20
00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.533
Miss Jiang is indeed a talented designer.

21
00:00:39.533 --> 00:00:42.400
One swipe at a time is an afterthought

22
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.166
Director Jiang, everyone says he is good

23
00:00:46.466 --> 00:00:48.266
You're the only one who called him trash.

24
00:00:48.266 --> 00:00:50.733
It means that your aesthetic is not online at all.

25
00:00:50.733 --> 00:00:53.266
What qualifications do you have to be the director of the clothing department?

26
00:00:53.266 --> 00:00:54.566
I'm not qualified

27
00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:55.533
You said it doesn't count.

28
00:00:55.533 --> 00:00:57.300
I really have this qualification

29
00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.533
You said it just now

30
00:00:58.533 --> 00:01:01.066
My on-site creative ability far exceeds your words

31
00:01:01.066 --> 00:01:03.166
This director position is for me

32
00:01:03.166 --> 00:01:04.566
When did I say that?

33
00:01:04.566 --> 00:01:06.000
Stop talking nonsense

34
00:01:06.133 --> 00:01:08.900
Playing tricks in front of so many people?

35
00:01:08.966 --> 00:01:11.666
You Director Jiang, you did say

36
00:01:11.733 --> 00:01:13.000
I heard it too.

37
00:01:13.133 --> 00:01:15.800
Since Director Jiang's skills are inferior to others

38
00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.566
Just give up your seat

39
00:01:17.566 --> 00:01:20.500
I believe that under the agency of the new director

40
00:01:20.566 --> 00:01:22.866
The performance of the clothing department of Story Group

41
00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:25.600
You will definitely soar
