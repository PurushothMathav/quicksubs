00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.190
What are you two doing?

2
00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:07.310
Gu Yu Xi

3
00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:08.030
He's your brother

4
00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:09.510
Do you know what you're doing?

5
00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:10.310
Get lost

6
00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:12.190
Gu Yan Chen

7
00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:13.710
What do you mean?

8
00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:17.310
I declare

9
00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:19.110
From today

10
00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:21.270
I cancel the engagement with you

11
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:22.910
Gu Yan Chen

12
00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:23.790
I give you a chance

13
00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:24.950
Take back what you just said

14
00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.270
Otherwise, our two families' engagement

15
00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:27.270
Will be completely canceled

16
00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:28.670
Are you sure you can afford

17
00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:29.510
The consequences?

18
00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:31.230
Miss He

19
00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:32.110
I thought

20
00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:33.390
We have the same thoughts

21
00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:34.310
My marriage with you

22
00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.910
It was just a business marriage

23
00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:37.270
Even if it is a business marriage

24
00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:38.430
I don't

25
00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:39.950
Share my husband with someone else

26
00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:41.110
Moreover, you know clearly

27
00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:42.190
You can't have a result

28
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:43.430
You even dragged her down

29
00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.390
How much cleaner are you than me

30
00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:46.750
Don't say that about my brother

31
00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:47.910
He didn't drag me down

32
00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:48.750
This brat

33
00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:49.630
What right do you have to speak up

34
00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:50.790
Who are you calling a brat

35
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:51.790
Gu Yan Chen

36
00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:53.390
I treat you like a treasure

37
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.110
But you want to be a blade of grass 

38
00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:56.350
I, He Jun Ya

39
00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:57.150
Rather be a broken jade

40
00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:58.150
More than a good tile

41
00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:02.350
Miss He

42
00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:03.750
Please feel free

43
00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:07.630
Want to see me

44
00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.390
Like something easily obtained

45
00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:10.190
Dream on
