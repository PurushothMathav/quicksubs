00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:01.550
Xi Xi

2
00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:02.150
Yan Chen

3
00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:03.190
Yan Chen, are you awake?

4
00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:04.230
How about Xi Xi?

5
00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:05.270
You and Gu Yu Xi

6
00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:06.470
Absolutely impossible

7
00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.070
She is just a toy

8
00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:10.510
That our family bought you for 300,000.

9
00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:12.390
There's no way I'm going to let you ruin your future

10
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:13.070
Because of her

11
00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:13.910
You and Xiao Ya

12
00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.070
Will get married this week

13
00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.950
No way

14
00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:17.070
Besides her

15
00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:18.390
I will not marry anyone

16
00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:19.830
Then we have to see 

17
00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.950
If your Xixi

18
00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:21.790
Can wait

19
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:22.910
Until you marry her

20
00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:24.150
Dad

21
00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:24.910
Dad

22
00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:26.190
What did you do to Xi Xi?

23
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:27.740
Dad

24
00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:28.550
I promise you

25
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:29.310
I will

26
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:30.630
Get married to He Jun Ya tomorrow

27
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:32.390
Dad

28
00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:33.190
Dad

29
00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:33.910
Yan Chen

30
00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:38.470
Brother

31
00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:40.510
Still thinking about your good brother

32
00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:41.790
Your good brother 

33
00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.550
Is getting married to me tomorrow

34
00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:52.630
Look at this pitiful appearance

35
00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:53.830
Let me see

36
00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:54.790
How you can seduce Gu Yuan Chen

37
00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:55.270
I said

38
00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:56.910
I won't let you have a good ending

39
00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:58.870
You think you can rely on yourself

40
00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:00.470
Can control your own marriage?

41
00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:01.990
Brother

42
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.710
Do you really not need me anymore?

43
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.550
Brother

44
00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.590
Next life

45
00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:11.780
Let's stay strangers

46
00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:13.830
Like that

47
00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.190
I can marry you

48
00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:18.190
Without any scruples
