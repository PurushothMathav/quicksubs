00:00:02.333 --> 00:00:04.266
Why did the dog come back?

2
00:00:04.533 --> 00:00:06.466
Oda psychic may have felt something

3
00:00:06.466 --> 00:00:07.600
Something may have happened at home.

4
00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:09.400
Retreat immediately

5
00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:10.300
I want to go home.

6
00:00:10.533 --> 00:00:13.266
Yes, please. Give me my money back

7
00:00:13.266 --> 00:00:16.566
If he doesn't treat the disease, he won't be able to wait for Wushuang to come back

8
00:00:16.566 --> 00:00:18.666
No news for 10 years

9
00:00:18.766 --> 00:00:20.633
Never come back

10
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:21.966
If you want money

11
00:00:21.966 --> 00:00:24.800
Then bury this tiger in a dog meat restaurant

12
00:00:25.966 --> 00:00:28.800
Xiaotian is a divine dog left by Wushuang himself

13
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.200
As long as you live

14
00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:31.833
Wushuang must be fine

15
00:00:31.866 --> 00:00:32.966
Yes, he is.

16
00:00:32.966 --> 00:00:35.400
Wushuang doesn't have to worry about us outside.

17
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:36.966
Then let this old trash

18
00:00:36.966 --> 00:00:38.900
Become a real fool

19
00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.466
What Supreme has come to my village again?
