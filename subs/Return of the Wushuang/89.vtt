00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:03.800
Ah, we didn't give a bride price.

2
00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:05.266
No bride price

3
00:00:05.266 --> 00:00:08.000
How could someone possibly be willing to marry?

4
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.800
Qingluan has a better personality

5
00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:12.100
He doesn't care about these things.

6
00:00:12.166 --> 00:00:15.300
The second aunt's family must have deceived the little girl

7
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:17.000
Yeah, stupid thing.

8
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.400
The little girl was bewitched by him

9
00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:20.666
Talented hum

10
00:00:20.733 --> 00:00:22.533
Who will believe it, son?

11
00:00:22.533 --> 00:00:24.533
Why don't we add some bride price?

12
00:00:24.533 --> 00:00:27.433
Pass this girl on to you

13
00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.266
But definitely better than my cousin

14
00:00:29.266 --> 00:00:31.566
It's much stronger without money or power

15
00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:37.300
Ah!

16
00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:41.300
Who are you? I'm the land merchant's cousin

17
00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.166
Now a manager of Zheng Cheng Group

18
00:00:43.166 --> 00:00:44.600
A million dollars a year?

19
00:00:46.333 --> 00:00:48.333
There is no bride price for marrying Lu Wushuang

20
00:00:48.333 --> 00:00:49.500
Better marry me

21
00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:51.833
For the sake of being the unparalleled cousin

22
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.333
Don't touch your hands and feet

23
00:00:53.333 --> 00:00:55.166
Xiaoxi, I'm not welcome to you.

24
00:00:55.166 --> 00:00:57.400
I like to have a temper

25
00:00:57.966 --> 00:01:00.100
You married Luwu and said you didn't have a penny as a dowry

26
00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:01.000
You marry me?

27
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Give you 600,000 dowry

28
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.400
No better than marrying him without a penny
