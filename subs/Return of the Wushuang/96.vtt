1
00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:01.900
You are a traitor when you marry Wushuang

2
00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:04.766
If you cut ties with Wushuang now

3
00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.266
Don't regret it.

4
00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:10.066
Regret cutting ties with traitors

5
00:00:10.066 --> 00:00:11.200
What is there to regret?

6
00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:14.666
I only regret that I agreed to marry my sister into your Lu family

7
00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:16.300
Peerless has no treason

8
00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:18.200
He only received the highest honor

9
00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.700
Shadows are brought up from the family tree

10
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:24.333
That's right, if Peerless appears in the family tree

11
00:00:24.333 --> 00:00:26.266
It should also appear on the first page

12
00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.866
The first page is really delusional

13
00:00:28.933 --> 00:00:31.700
Only the first generation of ancestors and the champion

14
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.066
To have such honor

15
00:00:33.066 --> 00:00:34.466
Absolutely impossible

16
00:00:34.733 --> 00:00:37.200
Ruwushuang has been a traitor outside

17
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.000
Can't be the champion

18
00:00:39.066 --> 00:00:40.500
Want to reopen the family tree

19
00:00:40.733 --> 00:00:42.300
Guangzong Yaozu will do

20
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.500
Wushuang protects the country

21
00:00:44.533 --> 00:00:46.700
So there is this honor

22
00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:49.766
It seems that you were brainwashed by Lu Wushuang

23
00:00:49.766 --> 00:00:51.266
Just his stuff

24
00:00:51.266 --> 00:00:55.000
How can it be possible to defend the country and honor the ancestors?
