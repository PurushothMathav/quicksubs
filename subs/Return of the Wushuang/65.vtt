It turned out that wanting this thousand-year-old ginseng offended me

7
00:00:18.366 --> 00:00:21.600
Even if you feed this ginseng to the dog, it can't be cheap for you.

The price increase is 100%.

13
00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:40.900
Twenty-two million, thirteen million. Huh?

00:00:43.466 --> 00:00:44.866
This millennium ginseng

16
00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:49.300
Even if you feed the dog today, I won't let you take it away.

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.766
I was going to settle your bill today

19
00:00:53.766 --> 00:00:55.800
But you're a self-selected dead man now
