00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:02.466
You never knew who I was from the beginning

2
00:00:02.533 --> 00:00:04.366
How dare you speak wildly to me here

3
00:00:04.366 --> 00:00:07.700
I don't care who you are who died on this land

4
00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:09.266
It's with our Peerless Army

5
00:00:09.266 --> 00:00:12.066
You are dying and you dare to be stubborn

6
00:00:12.466 --> 00:00:13.566
These people

7
00:00:13.733 --> 00:00:16.533
Not many people dare to stand in front of me and say cruel words

8
00:00:16.533 --> 00:00:17.333
green mountains

9
00:00:22.533 --> 00:00:24.166
Aren't you from here?

10
00:00:25.133 --> 00:00:27.133
Then I'm going to pierce this day today

11
00:00:27.133 --> 00:00:29.600
Who dare to pierce the sky?

12
00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:30.300
Wang Hu is back

13
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.200
We cannot be forced to strike

14
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:32.600
Run you run

15
00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:34.300
Run, run, run
