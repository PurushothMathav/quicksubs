00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:01.466
I am 10 meters away from home

2
00:00:01.666 --> 00:00:04.600
If you don't go back, you can't remember what your home looks like

3
00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:05.966
I'm going back this time

4
00:00:06.266 --> 00:00:09.600
You must be glorious and beautiful

5
00:00:10.966 --> 00:00:12.766
Something's wrong. Accelerate

6
00:00:12.766 --> 00:00:13.633
Drive now

7
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:16.700
What are you doing?

8
00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:17.766
What are you doing?

9
00:00:17.766 --> 00:00:18.866
What are you doing?

10
00:00:19.066 --> 00:00:20.066
What are you going to do?

11
00:00:20.066 --> 00:00:21.833
Uh-huh.

12
00:00:22.733 --> 00:00:24.233
What the hell are you doing?

13
00:00:24.266 --> 00:00:25.300
I am Lu Wushuang

14
00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.500
Lao Tzu, this house belongs to me

15
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.366
I'm going to split it now to send more money.

16
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:32.766
Unparalleled subsidy

17
00:00:32.766 --> 00:00:34.800
You took all the supplements.

18
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.800
Now you're robbing our house again

19
00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.633
Are you worthy of Wushuang?

20
00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:42.033
Wushuang, he's already a king turtle

21
00:00:43.066 --> 00:00:45.566
Village Chief, do you have to call the shots for me?

22
00:00:45.566 --> 00:00:47.133
I took care of them almost

23
00:00:47.133 --> 00:00:49.600
You change house to take care of you

24
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.100
Not following that annoying dog

25
00:00:51.666 --> 00:00:52.533
I took the gun apart

26
00:00:52.533 --> 00:00:54.666
Can't dismantle, can't dismantle?

27
00:00:54.666 --> 00:00:57.266
After dismantling the house, Wu Chao can't find a home when he comes back

28
00:00:57.266 --> 00:00:59.000
That's not up to you.

29
00:00:59.166 --> 00:01:01.566
Take it apart for me if he dares to stop it

30
00:01:01.866 --> 00:01:03.833
Just tear it apart for me

31
00:01:07.666 --> 00:01:09.666
Can't smash can't smash

32
00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:10.700
You can't throw it away!

33
00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.900
Can't smash it, can't throw it away?

34
00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.000
Can't smash can't smash
