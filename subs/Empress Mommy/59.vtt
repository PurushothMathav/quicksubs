15
00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.300

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.400
You haven't recovered yet

22
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.700
It can't be like this.

23
00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:09.660
You eat something and watch out for him

I grew up without a mother.

37
00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.680
I always envy other children for having a mother

38
00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.200
Why don't I have a mother?

39
00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.760
I still have so many things I haven't done with you

40
00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:47.820
You haven't scolded me yet

41
00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.080
I haven't eaten your cooking yet.

42
00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.620
I still want to fly a kite with you

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:55.300
