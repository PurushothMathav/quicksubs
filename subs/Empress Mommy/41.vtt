Hey, Young Master Sun

2
00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:08.280
Can I bring you something to eat?

3
00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:09.140
Thank you, Mr. Sun

4
00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:10.100
Thank you, Mr. Sun

5
00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:12.300
Don't drink alcohol

6
00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:18.480
Yo

7
00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.740
Wake up hey

8
00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.300
See when you can pick

9
00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:29.780
Heart and eye preparation

10
00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.220
You will be punished

11
00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.520
I beat you for two years, why haven't I gotten my comeuppance yet?

12
00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:38.500
Since you don't want to marry me

13
00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:40.740
Why did you let me in in the first place?

14
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.020
If it weren't for your immortal grandma having a crush on my grandma

15
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.580
Hey Tang Wu

16
00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.620
Don't say I didn't give you a chance

17
00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.760
Wait until I cheat your mother of all her money

18
00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:53.840
I can let you go.

19
00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.160
After all, have we had a two-year relationship as husband and wife?

20
00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.060
Right?

21
00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:00.860
Mr. Song, please let me go, okay?

22
00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:03.860
What do you think?

23
00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:06.980
Blame your mother for being so rich

24
00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:10.460
Gee, I don't want that either.

25
00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:11.400
But after all

26
00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.300
I beat you for two years

27
00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.900
If your mother knew about this, he wouldn't let me go

28
00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.060
Be timid later

29
00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.640
I have to cheat your mother into bankruptcy

30
00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.380
This way I have no worries, hahaha.

31
00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:27.180
Really confident
