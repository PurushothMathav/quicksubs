00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.420
What does grandma hurt?

2
00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:11.000
Grandma, grandma is not in good spirits today, so I notified the past again.

3
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.280
Come back next time.

4
00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:14.600
Although Mrs. Tang didn't finish her granddaughter's full name

5
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.580
But it has been confirmed that it is not Song Wu

6
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.460
Song Wu was indeed an impostor

7
00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:20.780
If you don't believe me, I have to tell someone quickly

8
00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:26.660
Cheers mom

9
00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:38.080
Hey, hey, hey, mom.

10
00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:39.200
Have a drink

11
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.060
Ok ok ok ok hey

12
00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:47.200
In-laws!

13
00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:48.720
Look at the two children.

14
00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:50.100
How sensible!

15
00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:52.160
In-laws, you educate well.

16
00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.960
Hahaha, in-law mother?

17
00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.340
You don't know

18
00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.320
This Liancheng team's little five?

19
00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.740
Better than my own mother

20
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.200
Ah yes, mom, the early morning is very nice to me.

21
00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.260
Never scolded me or let me work

22
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.320
Han Chen, you are good to Xiaowu

23
00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.020
You are very nice

24
00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.040
Small five size is bitter

25
00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.640
It's a lot to suffer

26
00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:17.660
This is what I should do.

27
00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:21.340
You have to work hard in the early morning.

28
00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.780
Help your mother-in-law take good care of the company in the future

29
00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:27.640
Don't worry, two mothers.

30
00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:29.640
I, Sun Liancheng, will definitely work hard in the future

31
00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:30.780
Will do well

32
00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:36.140
Mom, when will the company in Tianhai let Liancheng go?

33
00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:38.180
Can you arrange it today?

34
00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.960
Okay, I'll arrange it today.

35
00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:42.420
What's the position?

36
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.260
Manager?

37
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.400
Is the general manager okay?

38
00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:47.480
He was so nice to you.

39
00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:49.740
Our family can't treat him badly, right?

40
00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:51.740
Ok hahaha
