1
00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:04.666
It's You

2
00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:06.566
Mr. Wei

3
00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:08.300
What are you doing here?

4
00:00:08.966 --> 00:00:10.233
And this is my room.

5
00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:13.100
How can that work?

6
00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:14.433
It's all dirty.

7
00:00:14.533 --> 00:00:17.700
Sister Zhang, hurry up and take Wei Wei to change clothes

8
00:00:18.133 --> 00:00:19.500
Mrs. Zhang did it on purpose

9
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:20.933
I'm sorry, Mr. Li

10
00:00:20.933 --> 00:00:22.766
I didn't know this was your room

11
00:00:22.866 --> 00:00:24.600
Mrs. Zhang brought me here

12
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.566
I'm leaving Mingwei

13
00:00:28.133 --> 00:00:29.466
What's the matter, Mr. Li?

14
00:00:29.766 --> 00:00:31.266
I really underestimated you.

15
00:00:31.266 --> 00:00:33.300
The mouth says that there is no virtual loneliness

16
00:00:33.533 --> 00:00:35.866
I stole you to my room

17
00:00:36.266 --> 00:00:38.766
Mr. Li, I have already explained

18
00:00:38.766 --> 00:00:40.366
I asked my sister-in-law to bring me here

19
00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.566
If you don't believe me, you can ask him.

20
00:00:44.066 --> 00:00:46.600
Once or twice can be called an accident

21
00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.666
But you keep throwing yourself at me

22
00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:49.666
Manufacturing NetEase

23
00:00:49.933 --> 00:00:51.833
Is it a coincidence every time?

24
00:00:52.866 --> 00:00:56.566
If I say it's a coincidence every time

25
00:00:56.966 --> 00:00:58.200
Will you believe

26
00:00:59.766 --> 00:01:00.966
Play hard to get

27
00:01:00.966 --> 00:01:02.766
If there are too many times, it will be boring.

28
00:01:09.933 --> 00:01:10.300
original

29
00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.100
That old thing wants Mingwei, a bitch

30
00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:13.366
superior

31
00:01:13.366 --> 00:01:16.100
I'm worried about how to recover Bei Xian's attitude towards me

32
00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:18.766
You did give me a chance

33
00:01:18.766 --> 00:01:21.866
This time I must become a true hunter
