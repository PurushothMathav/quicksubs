00:00:02.133 --> 00:00:02.933
Mom

2
00:00:04.766 --> 00:00:06.266
I'm back!

3
00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:08.466
Mom, how are you?

4
00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:14.466
You hit me?

5
00:00:15.066 --> 00:00:16.266
You little bitch

6
00:00:16.266 --> 00:00:17.566
What happened when I hit you?

7
00:00:17.866 --> 00:00:20.266
If it weren't for you hitting Zhao Luo and running away

8
00:00:20.466 --> 00:00:22.166
The dowry money for your brother's wife

9
00:00:22.166 --> 00:00:23.566
As for the soup?

10
00:00:26.333 --> 00:00:28.833
Mom, my brother's marriage is important

11
00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.100
Then my innocence doesn't matter?

12
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.433
Humph important

13
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:36.266
You lose money, and you also pay your brother.

14
00:00:36.366 --> 00:00:37.533
Your brother is responsible for

15
00:00:37.533 --> 00:00:39.433
The heavy responsibility of inheriting the Ming family

16
00:00:39.766 --> 00:00:40.833
roll

17
00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:42.300
go out

18
00:00:47.966 --> 00:00:49.166
Raised you for so many years

19
00:00:49.166 --> 00:00:52.033
You can't even get me the money for a bride price. Get out of here

20
00:01:01.466 --> 00:01:04.400
Because don't feel sorry for those who don't deserve it.

21
00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.400
They don't love you

22
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:07.800
You have to love yourself.

23
00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.366
Why does a dead old woman have such eyes?

24
00:01:16.466 --> 00:01:18.166
How much is it to write with such a forgiving heart?

25
00:01:18.166 --> 00:01:19.600
You can afford it if it gets dirty.

26
00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:20.400
cut

27
00:01:20.933 --> 00:01:23.500
It was you who suddenly and inexplicably ran up to us

28
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
The old lady hasn't blamed you yet

29
00:01:26.266 --> 00:01:28.966
You came to reality to find my Mahan

30
00:01:28.966 --> 00:01:30.200
How dare you talk to me like that

31
00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:31.666
Do you know who I am?

32
00:01:31.666 --> 00:01:33.266
Such a big breath

33
00:01:33.566 --> 00:01:36.766
I really want to know who you are

34
00:01:36.766 --> 00:01:39.266
I'm afraid I'll be scared to death by saying it

35
00:01:39.733 --> 00:01:41.433
What's wrong with me

36
00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.866
Those you came just in time

37
00:01:45.866 --> 00:01:47.000
I had a bunch of supplements

38
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.533
Going to visit grandma

39
00:01:48.533 --> 00:01:50.166
I didn't expect this dead old woman

40
00:01:50.166 --> 00:01:51.766
Not only did it stain my new shoes

41
00:01:51.766 --> 00:01:53.600
He is too much and scolds me again

42
00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:55.100
grandma

43
00:01:57.066 --> 00:01:58.766
He is the fiancee you are looking for
