00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.000
Jiang Yuhang just said

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.033
You went to Yunhai Hotel a month ago

3
00:00:04.066 --> 00:00:05.266
Why deny it?

4
00:00:06.933 --> 00:00:09.233
We are best friends, of course I want to help you.

5
00:00:09.333 --> 00:00:13.100
Wei Wei, you and Beixian are pro-white, right?

6
00:00:13.533 --> 00:00:14.733
Even if it's so nice to me

7
00:00:14.733 --> 00:00:16.433
I promised not to betray him

8
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.900
I don't know.

9
00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:19.333
Tell you Han Wencheng to say that

10
00:00:19.333 --> 00:00:21.400
But I've never been.

11
00:00:21.666 --> 00:00:24.033
Really no no

12
00:00:25.566 --> 00:00:27.566
I asked the students to investigate this matter.

13
00:00:27.566 --> 00:00:29.066
Results will be available soon.

14
00:00:29.133 --> 00:00:30.466
You better not have lied to me.

15
00:00:30.866 --> 00:00:34.233
Mr. Li, I went to Renhai Hotel last year

16
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:35.666
Important to you

17
00:00:35.666 --> 00:00:37.400
Important because

18
00:00:42.066 --> 00:00:43.966
Beixuan has an emergency at home

19
00:00:43.966 --> 00:00:45.300
Come back quickly

20
00:00:45.666 --> 00:00:47.233
OK, I see.

21
00:00:49.533 --> 00:00:51.333
I'm leaving for such a small matter

22
00:00:51.333 --> 00:00:52.633
See you later

23
00:01:01.333 --> 00:01:02.433
That night

24
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.666
He obviously doesn't remember anything

25
00:01:05.166 --> 00:01:06.566
Why do you care so much?

26
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.100
Sorry ma'am

27
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.566
I haven't thought about it.

28
00:01:11.566 --> 00:01:13.100
You deserve it.

29
00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:14.900
Where is no robbery

30
00:01:15.566 --> 00:01:17.600
You gave it to me once

31
00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.666
This kind of person doesn't deserve to do things during their period

32
00:01:20.666 --> 00:01:22.033
I'm reluctant to arrange for him to see

33
00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.300
Mr. Li, Mr. Li

34
00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:26.400
I was wrong. I was wrong.

35
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.200
Mr. Li

36
00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.900
Li Xian

37
00:01:29.066 --> 00:01:32.800
What happened in the morning really has nothing to do with Mingwei

38
00:01:33.066 --> 00:01:34.500
Please forgive him.

39
00:01:34.766 --> 00:01:36.466
I never doubted him

40
00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.566
Li Xian, this is not like your criminal style

41
00:01:40.733 --> 00:01:44.000
You don't like him, do you?
