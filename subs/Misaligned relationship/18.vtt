00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:04.800
Don't you have eyes?

3
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:09.600
So unlucky

4
00:00:10.266 --> 00:00:12.666

You will never forget my old love

13
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.866

The person I love is still you

23
00:00:55.266 --> 00:00:56.166
Is this okay?

24
00:00:56.366 --> 00:00:57.666
You are wronged for a few years first

25
00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:59.300
You be my secret love first

26
00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.166
I swear when I get his money

27
00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.266

34
00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:32.000
How did my sister feel on her first day on the job?

35
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.500
Are you still used to it?

36
00:01:35.366 --> 00:01:38.233
What are you pretending to be?
