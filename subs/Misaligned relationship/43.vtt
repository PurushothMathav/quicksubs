00:00:01.133 --> 00:00:03.400
I went to the manager of Yunhai Hotel and checked

2
00:00:03.666 --> 00:00:06.266
Miss Song has been working at Yunhai Hotel

3
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.066
I also checked the time sheet

4
00:00:08.266 --> 00:00:12.066
It was indeed him who was on duty on the night of the 25th of last month

5
00:00:12.166 --> 00:00:13.900
He is your savior

6
00:00:15.266 --> 00:00:16.800
I signed the attendance sheet that night

7
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.366
Just let the name work for me

8
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.466
When we went to pick someone up

9
00:00:21.566 --> 00:00:23.766
A half jade pendant symbolizing the heir of the Li family

10
00:00:23.866 --> 00:00:25.266
It's on Miss Song

11
00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:28.900
Bessie

12
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.400
You believe me, I am really your savior

13
00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:35.300
Mingwei, you helped me on duty and didn't get caught by the manager, right?

14
00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.866
I bought it for 20 yuan when I went to the night market a few days ago.

15
00:00:37.866 --> 00:00:39.633
I'll give it to you if you like.

16
00:00:40.566 --> 00:00:41.700
Therefore, Mr. Li

17
00:00:41.933 --> 00:00:44.966
You are because Ji Xue is your savior.

18
00:00:45.066 --> 00:00:46.866
Is that why you decided to marry him?

19
00:00:46.933 --> 00:00:49.066
That night he risked his life to save me

20
00:00:49.866 --> 00:00:51.366
It is my duty to marry her

21
00:00:51.566 --> 00:00:53.366
Not Mingming

22
00:00:53.366 --> 00:00:54.833
Yes, I obviously saved Bei Xie

23
00:00:59.100 --> 00:00:59.900
slightly

24
00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.766
I beg you not to expose me

25
00:01:02.866 --> 00:01:04.400
Bei Hyun and I are truly in love

26
00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.166
I beg you not to rob him from me

27
00:01:06.166 --> 00:01:07.866
Why am I so lost?

28
00:01:07.933 --> 00:01:10.000
Do I like Shengli Bei Hyun?
