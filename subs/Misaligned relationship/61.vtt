00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.366
What if there's one more person? Bring it up

2
00:00:05.766 --> 00:00:08.366
Jiang Yuhang, you are not dead

3
00:00:08.366 --> 00:00:11.366
That's right, the people you sent didn't kill me

4
00:00:11.366 --> 00:00:12.900
Are you disappointed?

5
00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:14.700
Fortunately, Mr. Li saved me

6
00:00:14.866 --> 00:00:17.500
Wei Xian, you already knew

7
00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.500
Why did you just say it now?

8
00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:22.600
Because I have to wait for Mingwei to come back.

9
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.866
I want to clear his name in front of the world

10
00:00:24.866 --> 00:00:27.700
He's not the one who killed grandma

11
00:00:29.266 --> 00:00:31.100
Has the master calmed down?

12
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:32.366
It has arrived.

13
00:00:32.966 --> 00:00:34.266
Who is Song Jixue?

14
00:00:36.566 --> 00:00:38.366
Song Jiexue, come with us

15
00:00:38.533 --> 00:00:41.166
Luffy, I'm really jealous of you

16
00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.466
Obviously prettier than you, smarter and harder than you

17
00:00:43.766 --> 00:00:45.000
Why become history

18
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.366
It's you who need to help

19
00:00:46.533 --> 00:00:47.600
willing

20
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.866
Even if you die, you have to pull a pad back

21
00:00:55.166 --> 00:00:57.200
Liebenson Liebenson, are you okay?

22
00:01:00.533 --> 00:01:01.766
You're fine

23
00:01:02.366 --> 00:01:03.166
slightly

24
00:01:03.933 --> 00:01:05.166
I Love You

25
00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.366
Song continues to be charged with intentional homicide

26
00:01:09.366 --> 00:01:11.233
Instigate murder, betray life

27
00:01:17.266 --> 00:01:18.833
I never thought I would continue

28
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.900
Will come to this point

29
00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.600
What kind of person you become is your choice

30
00:01:24.733 --> 00:01:25.966
It has nothing to do with you.

31
00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.600
Don't take everything on yourself

32
00:01:33.966 --> 00:01:35.566
I still owe you a serious marriage proposal

33
00:01:35.666 --> 00:01:36.466
because

34
00:01:37.066 --> 00:01:40.000
I love you, will you marry me?

35
00:01:46.533 --> 00:01:47.333
I would.
