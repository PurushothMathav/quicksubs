00:00:00.533 --> 00:00:02.000
He saved me again

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.266
Tired things

3
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.400
Why don't you tell Li Beixian? I, Li Xian

4
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:09.600
Great, you're alright.

5
00:00:09.666 --> 00:00:11.200
Ji Xue, why are you here?

6
00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:12.766
So I heard you were at the hospital.

7
00:00:12.766 --> 00:00:14.200
I'm worried that something will happen to you.

8
00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:15.466
Fortunately, you are all right.

9
00:00:15.966 --> 00:00:18.566
What were you guys talking about?

10
00:00:18.866 --> 00:00:20.366
Why was I so impulsive?

11
00:00:20.533 --> 00:00:22.366
Even Ritsubukyun's fiancee

12
00:00:22.566 --> 00:00:24.500
This kind of thing let him know

13
00:00:24.533 --> 00:00:26.500
It will affect their feelings

14
00:00:27.066 --> 00:00:30.066
Forget it, let's not talk about it.

15
00:00:30.133 --> 00:00:32.766
Nothing. Maybe you heard it wrong.

16
00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:36.500
That's good Bessie

17
00:00:36.666 --> 00:00:38.566
Don't go in a hurry with other women

18
00:00:38.566 --> 00:00:40.066
I'd be jealous!

19
00:00:44.066 --> 00:00:44.866
Oh, I see.

20
00:00:44.866 --> 00:00:45.900
Not anymore.

21
00:00:45.966 --> 00:00:49.000
Mr. Li continues to seem to be in love

22
00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.033
Wei Wei, then Bei Xian and I will leave first

23
00:01:00.933 --> 00:01:03.233
Go on why did you lie to me

24
00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.833
Wei Xian, why did I lie to you?

25
00:01:05.933 --> 00:01:08.233
I said I was responsible for my woman

26
00:01:08.266 --> 00:01:10.733
It stands to reason that only I and you know about this.

27
00:01:10.733 --> 00:01:12.233
How did Mingwen know?
