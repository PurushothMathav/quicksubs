00:00:00.566 --> 00:00:03.266
Grandma meant for me to marry her.

2
00:00:04.266 --> 00:00:06.000
I thought she didn't like vanity

3
00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:07.300
It was all installed.

4
00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:08.833
She really wants to go up

5
00:00:08.933 --> 00:00:10.633
Destroy my relationship with chicken blood

6
00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:15.400
Slightly better than those duplicitous women outside

7
00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:16.666
Ten thousand times stronger

8
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.700
I like him very much since you like him so much

9
00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:22.366
Let's say he looks at you more

10
00:00:22.366 --> 00:00:23.866
That's how I see him every day

11
00:00:24.566 --> 00:00:27.400
You you bastard

12
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.466
Do you mind?

13
00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:32.966
No grandma

14
00:00:33.333 --> 00:00:35.833
In fact, to tell you the truth

15
00:00:35.866 --> 00:00:37.500
I knew Mr. Li before

16
00:00:37.566 --> 00:00:38.166
But

17
00:00:38.166 --> 00:00:40.133
I didn't know it was you until I went to the company.

18
00:00:40.133 --> 00:00:44.266
In the village, you and Bei Xian are quite fated

19
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.200
Are they all your actors?

20
00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:49.333
Grandma, I know how you feel

21
00:00:49.333 --> 00:00:51.500
But Mr. Lee has a fiancÃ©e

22
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.800
I have no plans to fall in love either

23
00:00:53.933 --> 00:00:57.466
I think it's good for me to be a leader and subordinate with him

24
00:00:58.133 --> 00:00:59.433
This is human

25
00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.300
Be ambitious

26
00:01:02.533 --> 00:01:05.033
How does this have anything to do with ambition?

27
00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:06.933
What about me, grandma?

28
00:01:06.933 --> 00:01:08.500
I will live up to your expectations.

29
00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.633
Become the most ambitious secretary of the General Assembly

30
00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.333
Miss Ming, drink water

31
00:01:17.333 --> 00:01:19.466
Oh, I'm sorry.

32
00:01:19.466 --> 00:01:21.633
I didn't mean to. Are you okay?

33
00:01:21.666 --> 00:01:22.466
It's okay. It's okay.

34
00:01:22.466 --> 00:01:24.966
Just wipe it, how can it work?

35
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.233
It's all dirty.

36
00:01:26.466 --> 00:01:27.500
Mrs. Zhang

37
00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.366
Hurry up and take a little change of clothes, Miss Aiming

38
00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:31.633
Come with me.

39
00:01:32.166 --> 00:01:32.966
Hey

40
00:01:39.666 --> 00:01:42.466
Ah, just go in and change it here.

41
00:01:42.866 --> 00:01:43.966
Thank you Mr. Zhang

42
00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.100
It's You
