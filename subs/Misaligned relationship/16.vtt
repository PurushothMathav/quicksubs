00:00:01.166 --> 00:00:03.166
Madam, I listen to your kung fu

2
00:00:03.166 --> 00:00:05.933
Throw away all the gifts of chicken blood

3
00:00:05.933 --> 00:00:07.566
Mi Hyun, this fiancee

4
00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.300
Not good character

5
00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:11.233
What can be done then?

6
00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:13.300
The young master can protect him

7
00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:15.733
No need to repay

8
00:00:15.733 --> 00:00:16.866
No sweat.

9
00:00:16.933 --> 00:00:18.000
My name is Mingwei

10
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.766
I have an idea.

11
00:00:22.566 --> 00:00:25.466
Is there so much competition for a job this year?

12
00:00:25.466 --> 00:00:27.666
I cast hundreds of copies and there is no news.

13
00:00:27.933 --> 00:00:29.800
The only person who made me go for an interview

14
00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.866
Or brush KPIs for personnel in the past

15
00:00:37.666 --> 00:00:39.500
Hello girl

16
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.200
Do you still remember me?

17
00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.100
You are grandma Li

18
00:00:44.933 --> 00:00:48.466
Hey, I've been bored at home recently.

19
00:00:48.666 --> 00:00:50.166
I just wanted to ask you

20
00:00:50.166 --> 00:00:53.833
Do you have time to accompany my old lady to chat?

21
00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.833
Okay, then you can send me the address and I will find you.

22
00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:05.166
You're here, come and sit, grandma

23
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.533
I don't know what you like, so I just bought some.

24
00:01:09.533 --> 00:01:10.966
Don't dislike it.

25
00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.466
Don't dislike 1073

26
00:01:13.966 --> 00:01:16.700
Or don't buy this broken fruit

27
00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.633
I want to count beautiful people

28
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.566
It looks fine to me.

29
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.700
It just so happens that I want to eat an orange.

30
00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.000
Hurry up and cut it and serve it up

31
00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:34.133
I'm used to them

32
00:01:34.133 --> 00:01:35.366
Don't you mind.

33
00:01:35.366 --> 00:01:39.333
I like simple and straightforward girls like you

34
00:01:39.333 --> 00:01:40.866
Thank you grandma for your tolerance

35
00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:44.866
Wei Wei, in fact, I asked you to come over today

36
00:01:44.966 --> 00:01:48.300
It's grandma who wants your help with something

37
00:01:48.733 --> 00:01:49.833
What's up

38
00:01:51.866 --> 00:01:53.233
Bring in a cup of coffee

39
00:01:55.333 --> 00:01:57.033
President, the coffee you want

40
00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:00.466
Why is it you again?

41
00:02:00.466 --> 00:02:03.366
Grandma Li's grandson turned out to be Li Beixian
