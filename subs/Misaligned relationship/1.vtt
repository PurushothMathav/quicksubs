1
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:09.466
Mr. Li

2
00:00:10.966 --> 00:00:11.800
Mr. Li

3
00:00:12.466 --> 00:00:13.766
Go to Yuntai Hotel

4
00:00:13.766 --> 00:00:15.600
Find the owner of the other half of the mandarin duck match

5
00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:17.333
He is my most beautiful benefactor

6
00:00:17.333 --> 00:00:19.466
She is also the future young lady of the Li family

7
00:00:19.466 --> 00:00:22.833
It's Mr. Li. I'm going to take the young lady home immediately

8
00:00:51.333 --> 00:00:53.366
Save me I don't want it anymore

9
00:00:53.366 --> 00:00:54.966
I will be responsible for you.

10
00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:56.600
OK

11
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.600
Obviously saving people with good intentions

12
00:01:24.733 --> 00:01:26.700
But accidentally lost the first time

13
00:01:28.666 --> 00:01:29.900
Why so unlucky

14
00:01:30.766 --> 00:01:31.566
Mingwei

15
00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.500
The manager didn't find out that you were helping me on duty, did you?

16
00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:37.833
No, don't worry.

17
00:01:40.266 --> 00:01:41.766
Hey slightly

18
00:01:42.066 --> 00:01:44.200
Your jade pendant looks quite expensive.

19
00:01:44.333 --> 00:01:44.900
Jiang Yuhang

20
00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:47.066
It's not that I'm usually reluctant to buy you a cup of milk tea.

21
00:01:47.066 --> 00:01:48.800
Why are you suddenly so generous?

22
00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.633
Could it be that the hooligan stayed behind?

23
00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.733
Ah, I bought it for 20 yuan when I went to the night market a few days ago.

24
00:01:55.733 --> 00:01:57.500
I'll give it to you if you like.

25
00:02:06.466 --> 00:02:09.100
Wow, it's beautiful!

26
00:02:15.333 --> 00:02:16.900
Who are you people?

27
00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:19.433
It's You

28
00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:21.400
young lady

29
00:02:22.266 --> 00:02:23.400
My name is Xu Yuan

30
00:02:23.533 --> 00:02:25.466
This is the president of our Li Group

31
00:02:25.466 --> 00:02:27.966
Mr. Li, we are here to take you home

32
00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:29.500
Li's Group

33
00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.000
China's top cut Li Beixian

34
00:02:32.166 --> 00:02:35.433
Is the jade pendant you wear around your neck worth 200 million

35
00:02:35.466 --> 00:02:37.366
The happiness of Riga's heirs

36
00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.500
The jade pendant belongs to Mingwei.

37
00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.266
The person they are looking for is him

38
00:02:41.266 --> 00:02:45.100
But it was finally my turn.

39
00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:46.800
I'm the one you're looking for.
