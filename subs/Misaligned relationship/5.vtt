00:00:02.166 --> 00:00:04.000
Get out of here, don't make me do it

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.500
Don't do it

3
00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:07.033
Why are you throwing me something?

4
00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:15.300
Hello

5
00:00:16.166 --> 00:00:18.066
Inscription You are fired

6
00:00:18.066 --> 00:00:20.466
From tomorrow you will never come to work again

7
00:00:20.533 --> 00:00:21.800
Manager me

8
00:00:27.066 --> 00:00:28.400
What did I do wrong?

9
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.466
Why did you fire me for no reason?

10
00:00:31.966 --> 00:00:33.666
Why are you so unlucky recently?

11
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:35.466
Job gone

12
00:00:35.566 --> 00:00:37.300
The house is also not allowed

13
00:00:42.133 --> 00:00:43.766
Mom is making a soft meal with you

14
00:00:43.766 --> 00:00:45.100
Boyfriend broke up

15
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.766
Why did you still snatch it back with ashes on your face?

16
00:00:48.166 --> 00:00:50.466
Divided mom

17
00:00:50.666 --> 00:00:52.866
I haven't found a job recently

18
00:00:52.933 --> 00:00:55.100
Can you stay at home for a while?

19
00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:56.933
Do you have any money?

20
00:00:56.933 --> 00:00:59.000
Eat and drink for free at home

21
00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:00.866
You have to pay for your living expenses

22
00:01:01.166 --> 00:01:02.700
The house is mine

23
00:01:02.733 --> 00:01:05.500
You shouldn't collect the living expenses, right?

24
00:01:05.866 --> 00:01:08.400
Grandma, you are back.

25
00:01:08.466 --> 00:01:10.666
Mom, just get used to him

26
00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.533
What's the use of your girl movie?

27
00:01:12.533 --> 00:01:14.166
It's not a home yet

28
00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.366
Why don't you leave the money to Minghui to collect the bride price?

29
00:01:19.466 --> 00:01:21.966
Maybe you can sign up for life earlier

30
00:01:21.966 --> 00:01:23.966
Just Minghui's unsatisfactory thing

31
00:01:23.966 --> 00:01:26.300
If you have money, go out to eat, drink and gamble

32
00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:29.766
I might as well give it to him and do charity myself

33
00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:31.200
you

34
00:01:32.333 --> 00:01:34.600
Well, anyway, your family does not raise idlers

35
00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.800
You will go back to the hotel tomorrow to deliver the goods.

36
00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:45.433
A little.

37
00:01:46.133 --> 00:01:48.466
You are at home, just live well

38
00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.566
No one can kick you out

39
00:01:51.466 --> 00:01:53.466
Grandma thank you

40
00:01:54.166 --> 00:01:58.066
What did the silly child's family say to thank you?

41
00:02:01.333 --> 00:02:03.166
Give me to me and do it well

42
00:02:03.166 --> 00:02:05.400
Hello, where is the back kitchen?

43
00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:09.066
Oh, later.

44
00:02:09.066 --> 00:02:13.266
Don't worry, why don't we get to know each other?

45
00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:14.566
I am Zhao Luo

46
00:02:14.566 --> 00:02:16.366
What are you doing?
