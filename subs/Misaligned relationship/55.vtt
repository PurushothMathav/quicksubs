00:00:00.466 --> 00:00:01.366
What are you talking about?

2
00:00:01.366 --> 00:00:02.166
continue

3
00:00:03.066 --> 00:00:06.600
I said I asked Jiang Yuhang to kill that old woman

4
00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:09.066
I set you up for jail

5
00:00:09.966 --> 00:00:12.800
No way. I'm not my best friend?

6
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.100
Friend, you are a country bumpkin.

7
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.666
You deserve to be my friend

8
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.300
I'm going to marry into a wealthy family

9
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.666
Playing with you just thinks you're stupid

10
00:00:23.933 --> 00:00:26.166
Just fit to be my foil

11
00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.933
If you lose points, sign this.

12
00:00:31.933 --> 00:00:34.200
I can still get less rebellion from the judge

13
00:00:41.566 --> 00:00:43.866
No way. I won't sign it.

14
00:00:44.266 --> 00:00:46.900
It's even less likely to give you a chance to come close to performance

15
00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.600
And the police will definitely find out where the water fell

16
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.166
In fact, you can choose not to sign

17
00:00:53.533 --> 00:00:57.166
Someone take good care of him for me

18
00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:04.800
Because after success

19
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.000
Everyone will think you are killing for this

20
00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.000
And I didn't become a real hunter
