00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:04.233
Yuxin

2
00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:06.600
I know you're sad that grandma passed away

3
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.633
But you still have me and the child.

4
00:00:08.733 --> 00:00:10.900
He and I will both love you.

5
00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:11.700
OK

6
00:00:12.266 --> 00:00:14.866
Why is the birthmark missing from your backstreet?

7
00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.200
Why are you going to work again?

8
00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:21.166
Naughty as a child

9
00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.000
Accidentally injured

10
00:00:24.166 --> 00:00:27.633
I think that birthmark is a bit ugly

11
00:00:27.666 --> 00:00:29.033
So I did it.

12
00:00:29.266 --> 00:00:31.600
What's the matter

13
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:33.666
You just had a baby

14
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:35.000
Go back and have a good rest

15
00:00:35.933 --> 00:00:37.833
But do people want to accompany you?

16
00:00:37.866 --> 00:00:40.400
Well, I've got work to do.

17
00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:41.666
You go back first

18
00:00:45.466 --> 00:00:46.666
Mr. Li

19
00:00:47.166 --> 00:00:50.300
If a scholar makes a birthmark from a scholar

20
00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.000
There will really be no trace at all.

21
00:00:53.266 --> 00:00:55.700
If the light color recovers well

22
00:00:55.766 --> 00:00:56.866
Maybe not.

23
00:00:56.866 --> 00:00:59.600
Not necessarily if the color is dark.

24
00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:03.233
You are asking me because you doubt Miss Song.

25
00:01:03.466 --> 00:01:04.266
Nothing.

26
00:01:05.133 --> 00:01:06.600
What were you going to say?
