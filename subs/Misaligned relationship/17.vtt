00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:01.933
Embarrassing you is what my grandma said

2
00:00:01.933 --> 00:00:03.300
The new secretary?

3
00:00:03.366 --> 00:00:06.700
My grandson's secretary left

4
00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:08.133
It requires personal attention

5
00:00:08.133 --> 00:00:10.866
I want you to take care of it.

6
00:00:11.166 --> 00:00:13.000
I just haven't found a job recently

7
00:00:13.133 --> 00:00:15.266
Now the work problem is solved

8
00:00:15.333 --> 00:00:17.000
Hmm grandma

9
00:00:17.133 --> 00:00:18.866
Thank you for offering me a job

10
00:00:19.133 --> 00:00:19.966
Hey

11
00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:21.533
Mr. Li

12
00:00:21.533 --> 00:00:23.666
I didn't know Grandma Li's grandson was you

13
00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:25.300
What a coincidence

14
00:00:26.166 --> 00:00:28.666
What are you pretending to be? Don't you mean Jilin?

15
00:00:29.066 --> 00:00:30.233
I don't have it.

16
00:00:30.766 --> 00:00:31.133
how

17
00:00:31.133 --> 00:00:34.066
Li Beixian's attitude towards me suddenly became so bad

18
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.800
Did I offend him?

19
00:00:36.133 --> 00:00:38.900
No, no, no. How do you know my grandma?

20
00:00:39.066 --> 00:00:39.866
Go ahead.

21
00:00:40.066 --> 00:00:43.200
How did you coax her into helping you enter history?

22
00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:44.366
Mr. Li

23
00:00:44.366 --> 00:00:46.666
I joined the History Group and everything was normal.

24
00:00:46.666 --> 00:00:48.300
There is no back door as you said.

25
00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.100
You're the one my grandma stuffed in

26
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.866
I'm embarrassed to say you go through the back door

27
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.300
Since Minwei has entered history

28
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.066
Just accept the mood you shouldn't have

29
00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:57.600
I can't possibly like it.

30
00:00:58.066 --> 00:00:59.966
It's him, get out

31
00:01:14.666 --> 00:01:16.966
Since the last time I offended that dead old woman

32
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.133
Ignore me before

33
00:01:18.133 --> 00:01:20.166
Now you don't even answer my phone

34
00:01:20.266 --> 00:01:21.866
Go on like this

35
00:01:22.066 --> 00:01:24.233
Madam Li's position is gone?

36
00:01:24.866 --> 00:01:27.300
Libby Xie was brought up by Qin Mingzhu

37
00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.433
They walk and send two relationship signals

38
00:01:29.466 --> 00:01:31.366
If it was because Qin Mingzhu spoke

39
00:01:31.366 --> 00:01:33.066
That's why Libby Xian snubbed you

40
00:01:33.066 --> 00:01:34.166
Adhere to normal

41
00:01:34.333 --> 00:01:36.966
Cousin, what are you talking about?

42
00:01:36.966 --> 00:01:38.566
If I don't succeed in marrying into Lijiang

43
00:01:38.566 --> 00:01:40.500
Your son has to be in trouble when he studies abroad
