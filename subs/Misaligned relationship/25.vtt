00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:02.066
Li Meixuan

2
00:00:02.066 --> 00:00:04.066
Shouldn't you give us an explanation for this?

3
00:00:04.066 --> 00:00:07.300
This kind of scandal happened as soon as I took office

4
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.200
cheating

5
00:00:09.366 --> 00:00:11.366
Hooked up with Xiaosan and committed rape

6
00:00:11.366 --> 00:00:12.700
Corporate skeleton plummets

7
00:00:12.766 --> 00:00:15.466
It's all over the city because of the woman

8
00:00:15.566 --> 00:00:16.900
What if this is the case?

9
00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:18.600
There has to be a proper solution

10
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:19.666
You're a CEO.

11
00:00:19.733 --> 00:00:21.000
Don't be

12
00:00:25.133 --> 00:00:28.400
At present, history has not established the derailment ceremony of Beixian

13
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:29.800
Make relevant responses

14
00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.166
I really underestimated Song Ji for writing about this woman

15
00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:36.066
He actually wanted to use the discussion to force Bei Xian

16
00:00:36.266 --> 00:00:38.166
Admit his identity

17
00:00:39.533 --> 00:00:42.000
Yes, people grab this point.

18
00:00:42.133 --> 00:00:44.000
The lawyer always gives an explanation

19
00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:45.966
So what can we do?

20
00:00:49.666 --> 00:00:50.466
Mingwei

21
00:00:50.933 --> 00:00:52.466
Mingwei, come out

22
00:00:52.666 --> 00:00:53.733
You promised me.

23
00:00:53.733 --> 00:00:55.266
You can't be irresponsible

24
00:00:55.533 --> 00:00:56.733
I never thought of that.

25
00:00:56.733 --> 00:00:59.066
Usually he seems to be quite honest and dutiful

26
00:00:59.166 --> 00:01:01.033
My brother actually wants to be on top

27
00:01:01.066 --> 00:01:04.166
It is also harmful to expose the video to the media

28
00:01:04.166 --> 00:01:05.666
Company, you marry your eldest father

29
00:01:06.133 --> 00:01:07.400
What are you talking about?

30
00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:08.433
What superior
