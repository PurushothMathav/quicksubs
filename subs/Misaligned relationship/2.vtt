00:00:02.133 --> 00:00:03.766
Today is the birthday of the astronaut

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.566
I have to surprise him

3
00:00:10.733 --> 00:00:11.666
Hello aerospace

4
00:00:11.766 --> 00:00:15.266
I'm here. I can't eat with you

5
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.466
All right.

6
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.700
How about that bumpkin believe it?

7
00:00:23.733 --> 00:00:25.033
Don't worry baby

8
00:00:25.533 --> 00:00:29.066
Mingwei that simp has always been obedient to me

9
00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:35.166
Jiang Yuhang

10
00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.833
Why are you with Wei Jinyue?

11
00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:47.500
Now that you have discovered

12
00:00:48.066 --> 00:00:49.300
Let's break up.

13
00:00:49.466 --> 00:00:50.633
break up

14
00:00:51.266 --> 00:00:54.233
I went into history right out of graduate school.

15
00:00:54.533 --> 00:00:58.066
Yueyue's father happens to be a senior executive of the History Corporation

16
00:00:58.066 --> 00:01:01.566
With him, I can save many years of struggle

17
00:01:01.666 --> 00:01:04.600
And your college degree is now just a waiter

18
00:01:07.566 --> 00:01:10.566
This 200 yuan will be regarded as compensation for you.

19
00:01:12.066 --> 00:01:12.866
Baby

20
00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:14.566
This year

21
00:01:14.966 --> 00:01:15.966
You have no money for postgraduate entrance examination

22
00:01:15.966 --> 00:01:18.866
Life is me working outside to give you takeout

23
00:01:18.866 --> 00:01:20.700
Pay the rent, take care of your diet

24
00:01:20.966 --> 00:01:22.466
The result is

25
00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:24.933
Just this 200 bucks

26
00:01:24.933 --> 00:01:25.766
Okay.

27
00:01:26.333 --> 00:01:29.966
I'm a graduate student condescending to fall in love with you

28
00:01:29.966 --> 00:01:32.466
I didn't turn around and ask you for reputation damage

29
00:01:32.466 --> 00:01:34.233
It's already pretty good.

30
00:01:34.466 --> 00:01:36.000
Don't be ignorant

31
00:01:38.266 --> 00:01:39.066
Jiang Yuhang

32
00:01:39.666 --> 00:01:41.266
Don't go too far

33
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:45.800
Mingwei

34
00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:49.600
Beixie

35
00:01:52.466 --> 00:01:54.500
Feixian, you have been single for so many years

36
00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.700
We all thought you'd never fall in love again

37
00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.166
Why did Zhang Shaowei suddenly figure it out?

38
00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:00.600
Multiple fiancÃ©es

39
00:02:00.966 --> 00:02:02.433
Grandma has been urging the marriage

40
00:02:03.266 --> 00:02:04.300
Even if it's good

41
00:02:04.333 --> 00:02:06.566
Maybe it was fate that brought us together

42
00:02:06.566 --> 00:02:08.833
So it was love at first sight.

43
00:02:09.866 --> 00:02:11.300
Gu Shao is right

44
00:02:11.466 --> 00:02:14.066
I fell in love with Bei Hyun at first sight

45
00:02:15.566 --> 00:02:17.400
Why is the smell on his body

46
00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:18.833
It's different from mine.
