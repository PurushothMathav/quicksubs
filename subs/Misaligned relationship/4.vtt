00:00:00.533 --> 00:00:03.100
Have we met somewhere?

2
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.800
He got what happened that night with his fiancé

3
00:00:09.866 --> 00:00:11.066
Don't say it

4
00:00:12.166 --> 00:00:13.566
My popular face

5
00:00:13.566 --> 00:00:16.433
Maybe anyone who sees it will feel familiar

6
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:17.900
Hey, I said Bei Xian

7
00:00:18.166 --> 00:00:20.000
You, the dignified president of history

8
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.200
That's kind of old-fashioned.

9
00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.333
Besides, your fiancée is still here

10
00:00:26.333 --> 00:00:28.300
That's not good.

11
00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:30.700
Yes, that's right, Wei Xian

12
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.333
If your fiancee gets jealous

13
00:00:33.333 --> 00:00:36.400
I can't coax it back now

14
00:00:37.366 --> 00:00:38.566
It doesn't matter.

15
00:00:38.666 --> 00:00:39.700
We're all friends.

16
00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:40.800
Just to say hi

17
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.266
I'm not that stingy

18
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.000
I see you're a little drunk

19
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.466
I'll find someone to take you back

20
00:00:53.366 --> 00:00:54.166
threat

21
00:00:54.733 --> 00:00:57.066
Why do you think Mingwei is a little familiar?

22
00:00:57.666 --> 00:00:59.900
He's a bit like you that night

23
00:01:00.133 --> 00:01:02.766
Libeixian won't find out that I'm replacing Mingwei, right?

24
00:01:02.766 --> 00:01:05.233
No, I have to address his concerns

25
00:01:06.533 --> 00:01:08.600
I was roommates with him for four years in college

26
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.000
Like normal

27
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.233
But he and I are two different people.

28
00:01:13.133 --> 00:01:14.466
Two kinds of people

29
00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.566
Mingwei is a very ambitious person

30
00:01:17.566 --> 00:01:19.166
He works in this clubhouse

31
00:01:19.166 --> 00:01:22.033
I often borrow money from me to buy clothes and wear white and rich beauty

32
00:01:22.333 --> 00:01:24.400
In order to do this kind of thing overseas

33
00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:25.766
To adjust the gold to the virtual

34
00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:26.900
This kind of woman

35
00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:28.800
How could it possibly be my savior?

36
00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:30.066
Must be an illusion

37
00:01:30.766 --> 00:01:32.266
Since he is such a person

38
00:01:32.333 --> 00:01:33.466
Don't associate with him in the future

39
00:01:33.466 --> 00:01:34.600
Save him from bringing you down

40
00:01:35.466 --> 00:01:37.166
Ok I listen to you

41
00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.866
Have a good rest when you go back

42
00:01:53.366 --> 00:01:54.166
Hello

43
00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:57.300
Go down and drive Mingwei out of the dark city for me

44
00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:58.866
Mingwei

45
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.166
I will never let you become my founder

46
00:02:01.166 --> 00:02:02.800
The young lady's stumbling block
