Help! Help! Help!

2
00:00:03.766 --> 00:00:04.633
Help!

3
00:00:05.166 --> 00:00:05.966
Ah!

4
00:00:07.533 --> 00:00:10.666
Is grandma alright?

5
00:00:12.133 --> 00:00:13.433
Thank you girl

6
00:00:13.733 --> 00:00:15.333
You are welcome

7
00:00:15.333 --> 00:00:17.500
But be careful next time you go out.

8
00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:18.966
Better find someone to accompany you

9
00:00:19.133 --> 00:00:19.933
OK

10
00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:21.300
girl

11
00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.200
You saved me I don't know your name yet

12
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.066
How will I repay you in the future?

13
00:00:26.066 --> 00:00:28.066
It doesn't take a lot of effort to repay

14
00:00:28.166 --> 00:00:29.100
My name is Mingwei

15
00:00:30.266 --> 00:00:34.400
Hey, you can always leave a contact information, right?

16
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:41.100
grandma

17
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.300
I have to go through the discharge formalities, so I'll go first

18
00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:44.466
Oh good

19
00:00:44.466 --> 00:00:46.066
Bye. Bye.

20
00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:51.700
grandma

21
00:00:52.366 --> 00:00:53.766
How are you doing recently?

22
00:00:53.766 --> 00:00:55.100
You bastard

23
00:00:55.366 --> 00:00:57.066
Remember to call me

24
00:00:57.466 --> 00:01:00.533
I was about to die.

25
00:01:00.533 --> 00:01:03.233
Fortunately, a good girl saved me

26
00:01:03.366 --> 00:01:04.666
It's okay, grandma

27
00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.300
Then why do you have to thank them well?

28
00:01:07.966 --> 00:01:09.533
I already thanked you.

29
00:01:09.533 --> 00:01:11.566
You finally gave me a call

30
00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.566
Tell me what's the matter

31
00:01:13.733 --> 00:01:14.966
I'm getting married.

32
00:01:14.966 --> 00:01:17.400
I'm going to bring him to meet you this weekend

33
00:01:17.866 --> 00:01:19.266
Hahahaha

34
00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.400
Finally figured out how to get married

35
00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.633
Let's make an appointment to meet at home.
