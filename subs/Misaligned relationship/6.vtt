00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.033
What's up?

2
00:00:05.766 --> 00:00:09.200
What are you doing stupid? Do you know who my dad is?

3
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:11.766
My father is the director of this factory

4
00:00:11.766 --> 00:00:14.066
I can give you face if I can see you

5
00:00:14.066 --> 00:00:14.966
Don't be shameless

6
00:00:14.966 --> 00:00:17.400
Come on, let me go

7
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.866
Handle women in broad daylight

8
00:00:21.066 --> 00:00:23.433
Zhao Gongzi's quality needs to be improved

9
00:00:23.933 --> 00:00:27.000
Where the hell did you get your little grievance?

10
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.000
Such a big hurry up Lao Tzu's newspaper dish

11
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.566
Li's Group Li Beixian

12
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.966
You understand? I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

13
00:00:38.166 --> 00:00:39.633
Well, I don't know Tarzan.

14
00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:40.866
I have eyes, not Tarzan

15
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.800
I, I deliberately let the violent offender go

16
00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:46.900
I'll get out now hahaha

17
00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:53.433
Are you all right?

18
00:00:57.566 --> 00:00:59.600
Three times a day, you're just fine.

19
00:00:59.666 --> 00:01:01.600
Recently, I noticed that the wound was touched with water.

20
00:01:02.266 --> 00:01:03.400
Thank you rascal

21
00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.900
Mr. Li

22
00:01:06.533 --> 00:01:07.366
You're welcome.

23
00:01:07.466 --> 00:01:08.800
Because you are the friend who refused.

24
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.800
Didn't you work in a hotel before?

25
00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:12.833
What are you doing here?

26
00:01:13.966 --> 00:01:17.033
Inexplicably fired by the hotel manager

27
00:01:17.166 --> 00:01:19.066
Wang Dong also kicked me out

28
00:01:19.066 --> 00:01:20.733
I really have nowhere to go

29
00:01:20.733 --> 00:01:22.633
It can only be delivered from home below.

30
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.900
So miserable, Miss Ming

31
00:01:24.966 --> 00:01:26.500
Did you offend someone?

32
00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.000
Who is messing with you behind your back?

33
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.300
You have offended someone.

34
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.666
But I don't have any enemies

35
00:01:37.566 --> 00:01:38.900
OK, I see.

36
00:01:39.533 --> 00:01:41.933
I have one more meeting, so I'm leaving

37
00:01:41.933 --> 00:01:43.766
Mr. Li, what do I give you?

38
00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.633
Why do I feel he is more familiar than a chicken dog?
