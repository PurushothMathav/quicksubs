00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:01.400
What are you talking about?

2
00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:02.400
What Shawn Wei?

3
00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:04.233
Wei Wei, you are out.

4
00:00:04.266 --> 00:00:05.666
You promised me

5
00:00:05.666 --> 00:00:07.666
As long as I tell you that Mr. Li cheated on you

6
00:00:07.666 --> 00:00:08.866
Expose to the media

7
00:00:08.933 --> 00:00:10.200
You're with me.

8
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.500
So I did.

9
00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:13.300
Can we two be together?

10
00:00:13.333 --> 00:00:14.800
Xiao Yuhang, what nonsense are you talking about?

11
00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:16.833
When did I ask you to do such a thing?

12
00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:19.866
News is fake

13
00:00:19.866 --> 00:00:21.500
I have nothing with Mr. Li

14
00:00:21.766 --> 00:00:25.000
Because you want to cross the river and demolish the bridge, right?

15
00:00:25.333 --> 00:00:28.400
I know you want to live a life of fine clothes and jade food

16
00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:31.100
So you leave me I know

17
00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:32.766
I don't regret it. I don't hate you.

18
00:00:32.766 --> 00:00:34.566
But why did you promise to get back with me?

19
00:00:34.566 --> 00:00:36.200
Are you going back on it now?

20
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.833
It's because I don't have Mr. Li's money, right?

21
00:00:39.366 --> 00:00:40.200
Education line

22
00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.900
You were the one who cheated on me for dinner

23
00:00:42.966 --> 00:00:44.366
It's still raking

24
00:00:44.666 --> 00:00:46.100
I can't be with you at all

25
00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:47.533
Such a shameless person gets back together

26
00:00:47.533 --> 00:00:50.000
I believe Mingwei would not do such a thing.

27
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:54.133
Mingwei and I were roommates in college for four years

28
00:00:54.133 --> 00:00:55.200
have a good relationship

29
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.466
No one knows better than me

30
00:00:56.466 --> 00:00:57.966
What kind of person is he?

31
00:00:58.166 --> 00:00:59.000
This thing

32
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.800
Someone must be trying to ruin my relationship with Bei Hyun

33
00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.366
And deliberately walked out

34
00:01:02.866 --> 00:01:04.600
Mingwei is also a victim

35
00:01:05.666 --> 00:01:07.966
Go ahead and thank you for speaking for me

36
00:01:08.466 --> 00:01:09.300
We are best friends

37
00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:10.766
Of course I'm going to help you.

38
00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:14.766
Wei Wei, you and Beixian are pro-white, right?

39
00:01:15.566 --> 00:01:18.466
Miss Song knows people know their faces but not their hearts

40
00:01:18.466 --> 00:01:21.566
Don't be fooled by a two-faced person like him.

41
00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.600
Be your best friend on the surface

42
00:01:23.733 --> 00:01:26.933
Behind your back, your man is a gold digger

43
00:01:26.933 --> 00:01:28.066
You are so disgusting

44
00:01:28.066 --> 00:01:30.000
Caused our company's stock price to plummet

45
00:01:30.066 --> 00:01:31.300
You shameless woman

46
00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:33.466
You don't deserve to be our colleague, get out of here
