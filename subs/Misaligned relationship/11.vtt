00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:03.866
Because you just said I promised you

2
00:00:03.866 --> 00:00:05.233
What does that mean?

3
00:00:11.666 --> 00:00:12.466
You will

4
00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:19.500
Don't worry, Mr. Li

5
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.533
The nurse has already given Miss Ming the medicine

6
00:00:21.533 --> 00:00:23.733
Miss Ming just fainted from fright

7
00:00:23.733 --> 00:00:25.033
The body is out of the way

8
00:00:25.366 --> 00:00:27.033
I see, you can go down first.

9
00:00:34.366 --> 00:00:37.466
Mr. Li, thank you for saving me again

10
00:00:37.566 --> 00:00:38.766
Just a little effort

11
00:00:38.766 --> 00:00:39.900
You're fine

12
00:00:42.466 --> 00:00:43.433
Are you hungry?

13
00:00:43.766 --> 00:00:45.300
Put it on the table after it's done

14
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.433
Can I feed you?

15
00:00:53.533 --> 00:00:54.666
No, no.

16
00:00:54.666 --> 00:00:56.233
I can do it myself.

17
00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:59.366
I'm afraid you'll get into trouble on the bed.

18
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:02.633
Zhao Duo has been arrested by the police

19
00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.066
He won't trouble you again in the future

20
00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.666
Mr. Li always shows up when I'm in trouble

21
00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.300
He doesn't seem to be that annoying

22
00:01:10.733 --> 00:01:11.533
Minwei

23
00:01:12.066 --> 00:01:13.666
What do you mean by that?

24
00:01:14.966 --> 00:01:16.166
What words?

25
00:01:17.533 --> 00:01:19.566
Make a wish to tell me when the car drives away

26
00:01:19.566 --> 00:01:22.833
You said I had promised to be responsible for you

27
00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:24.933
I've only said this to reporters

28
00:01:24.933 --> 00:01:26.100
How do you know?

29
00:01:30.866 --> 00:01:33.566
Go away he saved me again

30
00:01:33.566 --> 00:01:36.466
Why don't you tell Li Beixian about that night?
