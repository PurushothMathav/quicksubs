1
00:00:01.266 --> 00:00:02.400
Go, go, wife

2
00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:03.766
Grandpa called me last night

3
00:00:03.766 --> 00:00:05.266
Ask us when the wedding will be held

4
00:00:05.266 --> 00:00:07.000
If you have any questions, feel free to ask them.

5
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.766
We can treat him as a husband

6
00:00:08.866 --> 00:00:09.966
What about the grandson?

7
00:00:09.966 --> 00:00:11.766
Support your grandfather and don't take away people

8
00:00:11.766 --> 00:00:13.066
I'm a model husband

9
00:00:13.066 --> 00:00:14.966
I have a daughter-in-law and forget to raise my grandfather

10
00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:16.466
Hmm, right.

11
00:00:16.466 --> 00:00:17.100
Wait a minute.

12
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.666
You accompany me to discuss cooperation with an important client.

13
00:00:19.666 --> 00:00:21.066
If this negotiation is successful

14
00:00:21.066 --> 00:00:24.000
Our Sun's has been officially listed. Okay.

15
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:24.800
It's ok.

16
00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:33.066
Representative Li

17
00:00:33.066 --> 00:00:35.100
To express the sincerity of our Sun Group

18
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.400
We are willing to reduce profits to 30%

19
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.666
However, the patented technology must be shared and ordered.

20
00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:45.000
Mr. Sun, please wait.

21
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.366
I'll take a look at the file first.

22
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:55.600
That face is so sinister

23
00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.200
It's not a trap, is it?

24
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:00.666
Mr. Sun

25
00:01:00.666 --> 00:01:03.566
I am afraid that the shareholders of the company will find it difficult to accept your request.

26
00:01:03.566 --> 00:01:05.733
If there is no consensus on even this

27
00:01:05.733 --> 00:01:06.900
We will never go back

28
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:07.366
OK.

29
00:01:07.366 --> 00:01:09.900
I'll go back and have a good talk with the company's shareholders

30
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:10.800
What about me personally

31
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.466
I really want to promote this cooperation.

32
00:01:12.466 --> 00:01:14.300
Please wait for my good news, Mr. Sun.

33
00:01:14.533 --> 00:01:15.966
It's obvious that it's just to whet your appetite.

34
00:01:15.966 --> 00:01:17.666
Sample give me this set
