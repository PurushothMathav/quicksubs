00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.600
Boy, you used to be a soldier

2
00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:04.200
Why are you so cowardly now?

3
00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:05.633
Knife, you don't understand

4
00:00:06.266 --> 00:00:08.600
The high price of doing business in Binhai cannot be offended

5
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:11.033
Hmph, did Chen Xiaodao hear it?

6
00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:12.666
You now know my price is high

7
00:00:12.666 --> 00:00:14.266
What is the status in Binhai?

8
00:00:14.266 --> 00:00:15.866
Well, now I know.

9
00:00:15.866 --> 00:00:17.166
Ben Shao is magnanimous

10
00:00:17.166 --> 00:00:19.966
You two now kneel down and kowtow three times for me

11
00:00:19.966 --> 00:00:21.566
Give me that land again

12
00:00:21.566 --> 00:00:24.466
I could consider sparing your dog's life

13
00:00:24.466 --> 00:00:26.000
Sure, it's not expensive.

14
00:00:26.166 --> 00:00:27.166
Hahaha

15
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:29.400
Hahahaha

16
00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.766
Shaofeng, don't embarrass the soldiers

17
00:00:32.766 --> 00:00:36.000
Chen Xiaodao, do you care about robbing?

18
00:00:36.966 --> 00:00:39.700
Chen Xiaodao, how dare you hit me Gao Mingyu

19
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.166
I warn you, Wang Shaofeng is my brother

20
00:00:42.166 --> 00:00:44.100
If you dare to bully him again in the future

21
00:00:44.266 --> 00:00:47.166
As long as you are sure of what you want to do

22
00:00:47.933 --> 00:00:49.500
Ah, that's right.

23
00:00:50.133 --> 00:00:52.466
The account between us should also be settled

24
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:53.200
What do you mean?

25
00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.800
I am now from the finance department of Sun Group

26
00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.266
I'm here to collect Mr. Wang's account

27
00:00:57.266 --> 00:00:58.600
Mr. Wang has not given it before

28
00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.100
It turns out that you are the one doing the stalking in the bushes

29
00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:02.700
You are talking nonsense

30
00:01:02.766 --> 00:01:03.566
None of my business

31
00:01:03.566 --> 00:01:05.033
I'm a reasonable person

32
00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.666
As long as you pay back Wang Shaofeng's account, I can collect it.

33
00:01:07.733 --> 00:01:09.200
You give or not?

34
00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.700
It turns out that you are Wang Shaofeng, this trash who came to help

35
00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.700
I tell you the truth

36
00:01:13.766 --> 00:01:16.266
There is no problem with Wang Shaofen's materials.

37
00:01:16.266 --> 00:01:18.266
But you want money?

38
00:01:18.266 --> 00:01:20.200
But it's just what I said

39
00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.366
But I'm just fucking saying his material is substandard

40
00:01:23.366 --> 00:01:25.300
I just don't give money

41
00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:26.933
You hit me

42
00:01:26.933 --> 00:01:27.733
Ha ha.

43
00:01:27.766 --> 00:01:30.000
How could someone still make such a strange request?
