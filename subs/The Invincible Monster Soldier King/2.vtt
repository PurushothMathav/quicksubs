Damn bastard

3
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.500
I want them to be chaotic at any time

4
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:38.700
Is this a trap?

8
00:00:43.966 --> 00:00:46.200

You're dying anyway

13
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.500
I'm not afraid to tell you

14
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.466
There is a traitor within your Azure Dragon Squad

15
00:00:54.933 --> 00:00:56.066
He is

16
00:00:58.800 --> 00:00:59.900

17
00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:00.700
