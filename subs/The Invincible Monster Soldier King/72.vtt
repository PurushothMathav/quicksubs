1
00:00:07.066 --> 00:00:09.066
Knife, we found the kidnapper's hideout

2
00:00:09.066 --> 00:00:10.200
We're going to save my sister-in-law

3
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.200
Something happened to Ruoxue, he was kidnapped

4
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.300
Help me check two people

5
00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:16.033
These two people are extremely dangerous

6
00:00:21.366 --> 00:00:22.133
Did you find it?

7
00:00:22.133 --> 00:00:23.100
What are these two people?

8
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.266
One is a mercenary, the world-famous single soldier Wang Jem

9
00:00:25.266 --> 00:00:28.000
The other is the top killer known as the man-eating snake Mina

10
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.866
They received orders from the mercenary world

11
00:00:29.866 --> 00:00:30.533
Just came to kill me

12
00:00:30.533 --> 00:00:32.466
Confirmed that it is now in the mercenary world

13
00:00:32.466 --> 00:00:34.600
The price of the Dragon Slayer program has risen to $2 billion

14
00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.600
2 billion dollars. I'm not looking for them

15
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:37.866
They come to their door.

16
00:00:37.866 --> 00:00:38.266
adult

17
00:00:38.266 --> 00:00:40.266
I sent someone to Liangdong to rescue your lover before

18
00:00:40.266 --> 00:00:41.900
But the show and Mina's strength

19
00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.066
Far more than Xiang Liangdong and the others

20
00:00:43.066 --> 00:00:43.900
I guess you're right.

21
00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:45.800
Xiang Liangdong is definitely no match for the two of them

22
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.166
But their target is me

23
00:00:47.166 --> 00:00:48.966
So I believe in weak snow and cool summer and winter

24
00:00:48.966 --> 00:00:50.200
It shouldn't be life-threatening.

25
00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.633
Do you need me to go to the old leader and ask him to rank knowledge?

26
00:00:52.666 --> 00:00:53.200
Not necessarily.

27
00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.500
This is my personal matter, I can handle it myself

28
00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.966
Then I'll accompany you to meet them. Okay.
