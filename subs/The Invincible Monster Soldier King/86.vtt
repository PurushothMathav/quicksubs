00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:04.300
Honey, don't worry.

2
00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:05.733
Am I not alive and well?

3
00:00:05.733 --> 00:00:06.933
Who's worried about you?

4
00:00:06.933 --> 00:00:09.733
Don't be stinky, I'm wondering why your life is so big

5
00:00:09.733 --> 00:00:12.066
So many things are not dead yet

6
00:00:12.066 --> 00:00:14.700
It's fine as long as people are alive and alive, isn't it?

7
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:15.966
You're right, right?

8
00:00:15.966 --> 00:00:17.066
We're not going back to the army

9
00:00:17.066 --> 00:00:18.733
I support you, do you support me?

10
00:00:18.733 --> 00:00:20.466
Yeah, sure.

11
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:23.366
Honey, I don't want to be in the hospital for a second

12
00:00:23.366 --> 00:00:24.466
Let's go home.

13
00:00:24.466 --> 00:00:26.633
Okay, we're out of the hospital.

14
00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:28.433
Go home to the hospital

15
00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.200
It's incredible, Dr. Wang.

16
00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:33.300
How is Knife?

17
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.200
It's a miracle

18
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.866
His internal injuries are completely healed

19
00:00:35.866 --> 00:00:37.766
The broken tendons have also been restored

20
00:00:37.766 --> 00:00:39.300
That's really great.

21
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.133
That's not scientific.

22
00:00:40.133 --> 00:00:41.733
Thank you Dr. Wang, don't thank me.

23
00:00:41.733 --> 00:00:42.600
The knife recovers.

24
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.366
It's all about its super healing powers

25
00:00:44.366 --> 00:00:46.500
I didn't actually make any effective diagnosis and treatment

26
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.600
Anyway, as long as the knife is fine

27
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:49.600
You can rest assured this time

28
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:50.300
It's all night

29
00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:51.566
You should rest early.

30
00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.000
Thank you for your hard work, Dr. Wang.
