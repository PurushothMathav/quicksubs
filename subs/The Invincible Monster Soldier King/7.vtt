00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:03.166
The wedding is in three days

2
00:00:03.166 --> 00:00:06.166
Did you make a mistake in three days?

3
00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:09.333
Grandpa, what era is this?

4
00:00:09.333 --> 00:00:11.200
You still play divorce with me

5
00:00:11.266 --> 00:00:12.433
Anyway, our family

6
00:00:12.766 --> 00:00:13.533
Who wants to call who

7
00:00:13.533 --> 00:00:15.266
Are you trying to piss me off?

8
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.300
Grandpa Sun, please calm down first.

9
00:00:17.466 --> 00:00:19.366
I know you have a good relationship with my grandfather

10
00:00:19.366 --> 00:00:21.166
I want our two families to kiss and kiss

11
00:00:21.166 --> 00:00:22.600
But I also have self-knowledge.

12
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.266
I don't think I deserve your nonsense.

13
00:00:25.266 --> 00:00:27.166
I don't think he deserves you yet

14
00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:30.666
Grandpa, am I still your biological granddaughter?

15
00:00:30.766 --> 00:00:33.300
If you want to get married, I will recognize you as my own grandson.

16
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.133
I'll tell you what.

17
00:00:34.133 --> 00:00:36.300
If it weren't for Knife's grandfather saving me

18
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.166
I'm long gone

19
00:00:37.166 --> 00:00:38.800
Neither you damn girl

20
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.966
So you have to get married too

21
00:00:40.966 --> 00:00:42.200
You have to end it

22
00:00:42.366 --> 00:00:44.800
I grew up saying that these ears are stretched out

23
00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:49.400
Oops, I'm having a heart attack again, oops.

24
00:00:51.133 --> 00:00:53.300
Ouch my heart

25
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.500
My heart is no good

26
00:00:55.666 --> 00:00:56.933
Okay, okay.

27
00:00:56.933 --> 00:00:59.466
Can't I cut it off?

28
00:00:59.866 --> 00:01:00.766
Same no power

29
00:01:02.533 --> 00:01:03.733
I'm pissed off.

30
00:01:03.733 --> 00:01:04.800
Are you angry?

31
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:05.800
Then go quickly

32
00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:07.966
You two hurry up and go get Xu Gou here

33
00:01:07.966 --> 00:01:11.866
Oops, go, go, go

34
00:01:14.466 --> 00:01:15.733
You deserve to marry me

35
00:01:15.733 --> 00:01:18.400
I will definitely let you take the initiative to break off the marriage.
