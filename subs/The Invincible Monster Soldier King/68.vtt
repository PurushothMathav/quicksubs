00:00:17.666 --> 00:00:19.066
Hmm, did you hear?

2
00:00:19.066 --> 00:00:21.333
Qinglong actually made a move on Su Chibi's auction?

3
00:00:21.333 --> 00:00:23.700
Replaced the energy stone with a normal stone

4
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:25.766
Hit the Morgan family hard in the face

5
00:00:25.766 --> 00:00:29.466
Well, it is said that he also left a black card 2 billion

6
00:00:29.466 --> 00:00:30.466
Fair enough.

7
00:00:30.466 --> 00:00:31.800
2 billion bought it. Fair

8
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.700
He can't buy the face of the Morgan family

9
00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:36.466
Now the Morgan family is chasing him all over the world

10
00:00:36.766 --> 00:00:39.066
Said that the experts who participated in the activity plan this time

11
00:00:39.066 --> 00:00:40.466
They were all destroyed by the Azure Dragon Group

12
00:00:40.466 --> 00:00:43.266
That's their stupid choice to face the Qinglong head-on

13
00:00:43.266 --> 00:00:44.100
What can I ask for?

14
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.566
To deal with Qinglong, we have to start from his soft spot killer

15
00:00:47.666 --> 00:00:50.066
This woman is his weakness

16
00:00:50.533 --> 00:00:54.000
Not bad. Well, kill Qinglong, he's yours

17
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.766
By the way, is your voice simulator debugged?

18
00:00:56.766 --> 00:00:58.566
Don't worry, the sound processed by the imitator

19
00:00:58.566 --> 00:00:59.933
Similar to Qinglong himself

20
00:00:59.933 --> 00:01:01.100
Can reach 80%

21
00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:02.466
Then do it tonight

22
00:01:12.366 --> 00:01:14.000
Did you miss me, baby?

23
00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:16.600
What's wrong with you?

24
00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:17.800
Talk nicely

25
00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.400
Why are you using an unfamiliar number?

26
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.066
What about the previous number, hehe?

27
00:01:22.166 --> 00:01:23.066
My phone is dead.

28
00:01:23.066 --> 00:01:24.966
On the way, I met a few friends who were dragged to drink

29
00:01:24.966 --> 00:01:26.800
Do you want to pick me up later?

30
00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.600
Send me the address and I'll come pick you up right away
