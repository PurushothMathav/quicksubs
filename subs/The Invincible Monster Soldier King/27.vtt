00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.366
Who is this kid? Let go

2
00:00:03.566 --> 00:00:05.966
Let go oops oops oops

3
00:00:05.966 --> 00:00:08.100
Mr. Wang, I'm sorry, I'm just a rough person.

4
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:09.400
Got candy for you.

5
00:00:09.666 --> 00:00:10.466
Mr. Sun

6
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.400
This kid's IQ is so rude

7
00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:14.333
Ouch, Mr. Wang

8
00:00:14.333 --> 00:00:15.666
This watch is nice

9
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.066
It's okay, it's only 300,000

10
00:00:18.066 --> 00:00:19.466
Thieves sold abroad are cheap

11
00:00:19.466 --> 00:00:21.166
Domestic thieves are expensive.

12
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:22.666
In our country?

13
00:00:22.666 --> 00:00:23.800
Just not lacking

14
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.100
People with more money

15
00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:27.500
What do you mean?

16
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:28.700
Ouch, Mr. Wang

17
00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:29.733
I'm not talking about you.

18
00:00:29.733 --> 00:00:30.966
At first glance, you are young and promising

19
00:00:30.966 --> 00:00:32.433
It's not like those idiots

20
00:00:32.533 --> 00:00:35.533
When the stinky boy comes up, give me a slap in the face

21
00:00:35.533 --> 00:00:36.866
You wait for me.

22
00:00:36.866 --> 00:00:39.733
Will you look good later?

23
00:00:39.733 --> 00:00:43.200
You sit first, I'll go to the bathroom, I'll be right there

24
00:00:43.533 --> 00:00:45.600
Stop being crazy

25
00:00:46.866 --> 00:00:49.100
Honey, I'm going to the bathroom too

26
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:50.866
Wait for me

27
00:01:03.666 --> 00:01:04.600
Mr. Wang, don't worry.

28
00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.500
I promise to make a fool of you, brother Du

29
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.200
It's not annoying to see Lao Tzu

30
00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:10.733
Don't get it wrong.

31
00:01:10.733 --> 00:01:13.266
Don't worry about me

32
00:01:14.966 --> 00:01:15.766
Hey

33
00:01:19.466 --> 00:01:22.166
What has the knife been doing for so long?

34
00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:24.800
enemy spy

35
00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:28.500
Can you think about how to get him to pay?

36
00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:29.400
Don't worry, wife.

37
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.466
I will definitely ask you for your money today.

38
00:01:31.466 --> 00:01:32.266
So sure

39
00:01:32.266 --> 00:01:33.700
Just wait and see.
