00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.966
Who are you calling ugly?

2
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.200
I think I'm in the wrong room

3
00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:10.400
Who is the bully, are you blind?

4
00:00:11.933 --> 00:00:12.733
Heh.

5
00:00:13.466 --> 00:00:15.133
Ah, Su Ruoxue?

6
00:00:15.133 --> 00:00:17.333
What do you think?

7
00:00:17.333 --> 00:00:19.300
The decoration here is luxurious

8
00:00:19.333 --> 00:00:20.566
Must be expensive

9
00:00:20.933 --> 00:00:22.266
It seems that you are quite rich.

10
00:00:22.266 --> 00:00:23.500
What do you think?

11
00:00:24.266 --> 00:00:26.100
What do you say?

12
00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.266
I remember playing house together when I was a kid

13
00:00:29.766 --> 00:00:30.966
What do you think?

14
00:00:33.866 --> 00:00:34.666
Ah!

15
00:00:35.266 --> 00:00:37.166
You look okay.

16
00:00:37.166 --> 00:00:39.400
The money can support me

17
00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.666
I reluctantly agreed to this marriage

18
00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.066
I refuse

19
00:00:44.533 --> 00:00:45.100
That would be fine.

20
00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:46.100
If you agree to marry me

21
00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:47.700
It's dangerous if you don't get it right.

22
00:00:47.766 --> 00:00:49.033
This is 5 million

23
00:00:49.366 --> 00:00:51.966
You took this money and we got married

24
00:00:52.566 --> 00:00:54.200
Isn't that okay?

25
00:00:54.366 --> 00:00:55.433
You are so qualified

26
00:00:55.766 --> 00:00:57.700
I'm not a material person.

27
00:00:59.066 --> 00:01:00.800
I'm pretty valuable, huh?

28
00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:01.766
This is just a deposit.

29
00:01:01.766 --> 00:01:02.866
As long as you cooperate with me

30
00:01:02.866 --> 00:01:05.500
Tell your mother and grandpa that you want to ruin your marriage

31
00:01:05.666 --> 00:01:06.466
OK

32
00:01:06.766 --> 00:01:08.166
Say you have a girlfriend

33
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.200
There's 5 million and 5 million

34
00:01:12.733 --> 00:01:15.100
No, I don't have a girlfriend.

35
00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:16.266
What does this have to do with me?

36
00:01:16.266 --> 00:01:18.966
Do you want money or do you want to choose?

37
00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:21.700
Look at this

38
00:01:22.333 --> 00:01:23.966
You take it goodbye

39
00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:25.666
Never see you again

40
00:01:30.733 --> 00:01:32.566
Grandpa, you stinky girl

41
00:01:32.566 --> 00:01:34.366
I knew you were going behind my back

42
00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:35.200
I'll tell you both

43
00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.033
Neither of you can return this marriage.

44
00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.200
Go for marriage registration now

45
00:01:39.366 --> 00:01:41.933
Wedding in three days?

46
00:01:41.933 --> 00:01:44.966
Did you make a mistake in three days?
