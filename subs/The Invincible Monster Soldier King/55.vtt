00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:02.733
Uncle Sun, your old mother-in-law keeps her word

2
00:00:02.733 --> 00:00:04.600
Our brothers are also lucky in their hearts.

3
00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:05.133
But

4
00:00:05.133 --> 00:00:07.300
It's not easy for us to follow you and build this country

5
00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:09.533
If you hand him over to such an incompetent person

6
00:00:09.533 --> 00:00:10.833
What if you lose it all?

7
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:12.400
Right

8
00:00:13.066 --> 00:00:13.900
self-direction

9
00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:15.800
Even if you can fill this hole

10
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.466
Sun married also has to harvest a lot of vitality

11
00:00:17.466 --> 00:00:18.733
What if there is a next time?

12
00:00:18.733 --> 00:00:21.100
Your boss can't pay for the coffin

13
00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:21.900
you

14
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:23.633
primary school

15
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.666
Do you all think so too?

16
00:00:27.666 --> 00:00:30.000
I Tiba Chu Sun Ruoxue Chairperson position

17
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.333
Women should go home to their husbands and children

18
00:00:32.333 --> 00:00:35.466
We need to choose capable people to manage the group

19
00:00:35.466 --> 00:00:37.266
Bastard my Sun family

20
00:00:37.266 --> 00:00:39.500
After all, it is still the largest shareholder of the group

21
00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.100
At this time, the decision of the group is not up to you

22
00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.033
Ah, it's over.

23
00:00:44.466 --> 00:00:47.233
Mr. Zhao, Mr. Gao, you are finally here

24
00:00:47.466 --> 00:00:49.600
What are you two doing here, security?

25
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.433
Blow them both out

26
00:00:53.533 --> 00:00:54.266
What are you doing?

27
00:00:54.266 --> 00:00:56.533
Move, drive out the future chairperson

28
00:00:56.533 --> 00:00:58.733
They probably don't have the guts yet

29
00:00:58.733 --> 00:01:00.066
Hahahaha

30
00:01:00.066 --> 00:01:01.166
What are you talking about?
