00:00:19.733 --> 00:00:20.533
salute

2
00:00:56.266 --> 00:00:57.700
I asked you to investigate

3
00:00:58.133 --> 00:00:59.833
Do you have a clue, my lord?

4
00:01:00.133 --> 00:01:01.966
Xu Liang's family was kidnapped by a mysterious person

5
00:01:01.966 --> 00:01:03.466
The other party blackmailed him for 100 million

6
00:01:03.466 --> 00:01:05.333
That's why Xu Liang was forced to betray us

7
00:01:05.333 --> 00:01:06.400
I know Xu Liang

8
00:01:06.966 --> 00:01:08.033
Not only as a last resort

9
00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:09.666
Don't go out soon

10
00:01:09.666 --> 00:01:11.000
Strangely enough

11
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.366
Xu Liang

12
00:01:11.366 --> 00:01:13.833
They didn't sell our information directly to each other.

13
00:01:13.933 --> 00:01:15.966
It was on a foreign website.

14
00:01:16.066 --> 00:01:17.700
Publicly sell our message

15
00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.766
You mean order the world

16
00:01:19.966 --> 00:01:22.600
Hmm so I think

17
00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.066
The opponent's target is not the Qinglong team

18
00:01:25.333 --> 00:01:27.866
But the people of Qinglong
