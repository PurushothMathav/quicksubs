00:00:02.933 --> 00:00:03.900
Give it to him

2
00:00:10.533 --> 00:00:12.433
Hey, thank you, Mr. Gao

3
00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.066
You're such a nice guy, oh yeah

4
00:00:14.066 --> 00:00:16.700
Don't worry about my brother's land

5
00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:19.233
Otherwise, no more, no more.

6
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:21.366
Let's go Xiaofang

7
00:00:21.366 --> 00:00:22.500
Let's go have a drink

8
00:00:41.933 --> 00:00:43.100
What are you still doing?

9
00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:44.266
Take me to the hospital

10
00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:45.833
The pain is killing me.

11
00:00:47.466 --> 00:00:49.366
Who the hell are you?

12
00:00:50.533 --> 00:00:51.566
Oh, dear.

13
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.633
Captain enters one

14
00:00:54.166 --> 00:00:55.400
Long time no see. Hmm.

15
00:01:00.866 --> 00:01:03.066
Captain, why did you come to Binhai?

16
00:01:04.133 --> 00:01:06.133
Injured and discharged

17
00:01:06.133 --> 00:01:07.700
You are Captain Seven Dragons

18
00:01:07.733 --> 00:01:08.966
Even you are discharged

19
00:01:08.966 --> 00:01:10.966
Can't tell him I'm investigating the murderer

20
00:01:10.966 --> 00:01:12.466
So as not to cause trouble to Shao Feng

21
00:01:12.466 --> 00:01:14.300
Didn't you also leave the army?

22
00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.700
We can't carry guns all our lives, can we?

23
00:01:17.266 --> 00:01:20.433
I really had no choice but to leave the army

24
00:01:20.733 --> 00:01:21.633
Yes!

25
00:01:22.566 --> 00:01:25.766
If you hadn't saved that girl bravely

26
00:01:26.066 --> 00:01:28.833
Beat the second son of the Zhao family in Kyoto to a cripple

27
00:01:29.133 --> 00:01:30.800
You wouldn't be like this now

28
00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.533
If you hadn't saved me back then

29
00:01:33.533 --> 00:01:34.666
My life

30
00:01:34.666 --> 00:01:36.100
Long gone

31
00:01:37.666 --> 00:01:40.366
We seem powerful in the eyes of others

32
00:01:40.366 --> 00:01:41.966
But back to life

33
00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:43.700
There are also all kinds of helplessness

34
00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.100
The firewood, rice, oil, salt, sauce, vinegar and tea in this life

35
00:01:46.133 --> 00:01:47.966
Which one was hit with a fist?

36
00:01:48.966 --> 00:01:51.300
This is life, Captain

37
00:01:54.066 --> 00:01:55.200
Oh yes captain

38
00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:57.733
Why do you work at Sun's Group?
