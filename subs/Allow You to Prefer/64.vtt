00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:05.040
Wait a minute, no see in two days,

2
00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:06.970
I know how to do business.

3
00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:14.950
I want to miss you too.

4
00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:16.910
One question, I will miss you when I meet you.

5
00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:23.890
Die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die

6
00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:28.840
Die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die

7
00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:35.360
Die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die

8
00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:47.900
Die die die die die die die die die die die die die die die die die die die die die die die die die die die die die die die die Die die die die die die die die die die die die die die die die die die die die die die die die die die die die die die die die Die to death

9
00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.600
I just saw Axiang being taken away

10
00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:54.380
What did he let go of, Sister Lin's family?

11
00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.950
why are you here

12
00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.160
Although I am here to pick the country, the feelings you give and hold

13
00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.860
Otherwise, you think I came to see you

14
00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:02.900
I'm here to give you a gift

15
00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:04.220
I'm not healthy

16
00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:06.530
What happened to Axiang?

17
00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:10.720
A Xiang admits that he just hates pushing people away

18
00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:11.680
The missing murderer is gone

19
00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:13.620
Axiang is the murderer

20
00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:15.920
He got lost as a child

21
00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.000
Or I brought it to him and wished for it

22
00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.260
He also has some news about me

23
00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.250
This should happen to him today

24
00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:28.250
You can only eat noodles without knowing your conscience, right?

25
00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:29.760
Then Yan Chi and I will

26
00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:33.440
Do you know what you really want? Yan Jiajin

27
00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.030
What's wrong

28
00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.970
Just say it

29
00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:40.510
I found this road in Greywater

30
00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:41.860
I checked all the controls

31
00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:43.920
You put it below what you said

32
00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:50.640
Why did you do this? I saw it, stinky Ozawa.

33
00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:52.440
Wei Boyang

34
00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:54.080
We went to music together last night

35
00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:58.200
Do you know that Wei Boyang is right?

36
00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:02.870
This Lu Yingqi was committed by the four-year-old Wilber Yang control

37
00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:04.320
Not only do you listen to me first

38
00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:06.690
And he ended up with Wilbur Yang.

39
00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:08.139
What do you want to do

40
00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:09.740
No, I'm gone

41
00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:11.430
This arrow hoop

42
00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:12.970
Can we not have a relationship?

43
00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:14.480
I bought this online myself

44
00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:15.800
Don't wirelessly connect me

45
00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:18.340
Then what will you and I do today?

46
00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:21.410
You have to call me
