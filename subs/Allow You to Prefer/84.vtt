To move the battery, move the small tower so that you can't find the raw materials first.

2
00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:08.600
It doesn't matter. If you don't want the raw materials, just don't miss the raw materials.

3
00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:12.520
Anyway, our affairs are with him.

4
00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.910
Battery I want this orange.

5
00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:38.300
There is a meeting of the Houfengtong Group at the Seventh General Conference.

6
00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:43.030
Sister, please recuperate and I'll go out for a while.

7
00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:56.260
Hello, I've received the white one.

8
00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:58.040
If there are no special circumstances in the future.

9
00:00:58.300 --> 00:00:59.340
We just don't understand anymore.

10
00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.740
I understand, cultivate it well.

11
00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:08.310
When I went to Cha Lin's house, I missed every single one of my records.

12
00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:14.070
Yes, Mr. Qi, a ring with a message.

13
00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:17.380
How is Wan Xiaoxing studying?

14
00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:19.360
Miss Yi, don’t lose

15
00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:23.770
Wouldn't it be better if you don't risk losing?

16
00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:26.790
Where are you not going? Qian Enchi

17
00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:28.890
You can't even give it to me if you don't trust me

18
00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:31.210
I feel like we had nothing to say before

19
00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.380
I keep all my belongings with me

20
00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:36.450
There are also portraits of Xiaochen abroad

21
00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:44.040
I will recall the danger as soon as possible. Fortunately, you said

22
00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:47.310
You can forgive your family for doing so-called things

23
00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:53.030
We've already eliminated the danger, okay?

24
00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:58.520
It’s not that I’m not angry enough after losing.

25
00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:12.360
Are you having trouble with Tianzhi?

26
00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.020
how do you know

27
00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:14.650
Don’t lose my design process outside

28
00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:15.980
I'll tell you when you come up
