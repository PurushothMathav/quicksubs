00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:03.000
Teach me some sympathy.

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.080
No, our people checked his call records,

3
00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:07.590
Among them, it is likely that there is a foreign account,

4
00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:09.750
However, the information was completely damaged.

5
00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:11.780
Let it go and figure out how to hate it.

6
00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:13.540
People who don’t like the information will pay for the data,

7
00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.980
Not going now. I lied.

8
00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.960
It doesn't matter whether you prepare to fly the message or not. Do what I say after finishing this life.

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.140
running towards,

10
00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:27.540
You have to decide whether it's better to have a divorce with me.

11
00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.310
It's all me who has caused you trouble, Yan Shi,

12
00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.260
Do you really want to feed me?

13
00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.270
You are obviously my sister, why do I have any reason to accompany you?

14
00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:42.160
This is the work of my own hands,

15
00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:44.870
You made it with your own hands

16
00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:48.770
It’s worth becoming more and more able to trust and care for others.

17
00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:56.060
Buy you points

18
00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:02.520
I'm tired of having a stomachache

19
00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:04.810
Let me go to the bathroom

20
00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:13.500
Is there Zhang Cheng from abroad?

21
00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:28.390
Call the leader. Whose sister are you?

22
00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:30.320
You called just now

23
00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:36.390
What did I tell you?

24
00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:37.170
Didn't say anything

25
00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.290
he heard my voice

26
00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:40.340
That’s it, sister

27
00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.090
Not who it is

28
00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:43.570
Zaer phone bar

29
00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:45.590
Give it to Zaer

30
00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:47.560
I'll go crazy for him now, okay?

31
00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:49.180
I'm used to it

32
00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:51.710
Please ask Yansheng for me

33
00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:54.250
Let's see when we can be discharged from the hospital.

34
00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.040
Didn't you say you don't want to send letters from far away?

35
00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:08.419
Why are you waiting for me to say anything else?

36
00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:09.680
who called you

37
00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:11.740
Your Majesty is sick again, isn't it you?
