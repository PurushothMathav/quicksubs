00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:04.920
Once upon a time I was so loved that I was overwhelmed with love,

2
00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:07.170
Seeing that Qiu Xiuhe is a gentleman and a kind man,

3
00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.660
I want to insert it,

4
00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:15.250
For months, I wanted to see you,

5
00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:20.180
That's what happened. I want you to check the school for me.

6
00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:23.990
Do you really want to check the school?

7
00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:27.020
What? Is there anything hard for you to touch?

8
00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:29.470
You are my best friend,

9
00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:32.439
I can only find you,

10
00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:34.600
I know a very powerful private detective,

11
00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:36.620
As long as Xuehang has contact with someone,

12
00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:39.440
He is disconnected and can be found out. I will call him now.

13
00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:44.880
Although I asked you to check it for me,

14
00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:47.380
Who did my first husband have an affair with?

15
00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.120
Another good one,

16
00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:50.500
Thank you.

17
00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:00.660
These are the Honghongpo people who drive

18
00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:03.140
Then there is one thing I can ask you about.

19
00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:06.390
Lin Changben goes to bed at three or four o'clock every afternoon

20
00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:07.870
You can ask your son

21
00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:09.610
Have you ever been with your father?

22
00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:10.810
if not

23
00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:13.210
I suspect that the person I am waiting for is sleeping

24
00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:25.180
Our boss knows a few things every day

25
00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:31.020
Dad will come over at four o'clock every afternoon to accompany me to paint pictures

26
00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:39.260
What are you afraid of?

27
00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:43.830
So, ah, what is this door about?

28
00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:45.050
He doesn't seem to be the door

29
00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:05.740
What kind of person is this teacher?

30
00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.760
I'm the same kind of guy who got me halfway last time

31
00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:16.360
Then who is this woman next to her? She died of old age

32
00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.050
Brother whispered and laughed a little loudly

33
00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:26.030
Should I meet this person in the hospital?

34
00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:29.450
Tracking is not you

35
00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:42.500
Let's follow mine

36
00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:44.600
Will this name be listed quickly?
