00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.790
I'm sorry, it's just because I was punished today,

2
00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:05.070
Is that why I packed it?

3
00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:08.700
If my mother agrees, you will be in trouble. Do you want to admit it again? Say it again!

4
00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:11.980
No amount of money can buy my mother's body.

5
00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:14.750
And how short it is,

6
00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:15.990
Got results?

7
00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:20.220
Right or wrong, I won’t talk about it anymore. I’ll tell you when I see you. Sit, sit, sit!

8
00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.720
Husband, I think you want this Pan family,

9
00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:23.780
I will follow your family's hand!

10
00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:42.950
What's the name of water now? It's so troublesome. How can we put it there?

11
00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.930
Husband, let me give you a guess, get out, get out!

12
00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:47.270
I don't have my permission

13
00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:48.710
Don’t make money as a technology queen

14
00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:54.820
Look over there to eat

15
00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:55.720
how to say

16
00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.220
Why do you want more?

17
00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.720
Is it possible to get on the line with him?

18
00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:01.700
It's okay for me to eat beforehand.

19
00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:04.750
Do you want to settle down with me now?

20
00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:10.700
Damn yellow face

21
00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.100
After the superior has made arrangements

22
00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.320
But he's not here today

23
00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:15.740
I must let you leave the city

24
00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:22.440
Standstill

25
00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:23.360
It's people watching

26
00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:24.300
Why don't you have to say it?

27
00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:25.600
If so, right?

28
00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.000
Who do you call Dashan?

29
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:27.580
You apologize enough

30
00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:29.580
I think people like you are a pig-like Buffer.

31
00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:30.960
Will you apologize with me?

32
00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:32.350
Come out with your words like this

33
00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:33.930
I knew it was me who dyed my eyes

34
00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:35.740
Really owe a lot

35
00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:38.820
So bad actually

36
00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.650
Your husband must not love you

37
00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:42.810
Why not as young as me?

38
00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.910
Are you so angry?

39
00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:46.170
You dare to hit me

40
00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.370
I want you to kneel down and gasp

41
00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.350
Why are you still beating people?

42
00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.570
Hurry up and circle back

43
00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:51.640
People like him

44
00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.240
It seems at first glance that this family is unhappy

45
00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:54.980
It must be the girl below

46
00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:56.320
Looks better than him

47
00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.880
This kind of person is mentally perverted

48
00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.560
No, obviously he counts half to five of mine.

49
00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.110
turn you to me

50
00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:06.190
Look, I'm walking in circles thinking

51
00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:08.960
what is that

52
00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:13.960
It's definitely not some over-the-top night shift.

53
00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:16.390
Listen to the people under Guangzhu

54
00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:18.550
Do you still want to stay away from Xu Shi?

55
00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:19.270
My son went

56
00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:21.230
You have been without a mother for eight lifetimes

57
00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.540
What did you say, aunt?

58
00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:25.260
You are Xu Heng’s mother
