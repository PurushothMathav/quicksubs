00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:05.360
Why? It's him. He said I'll tell you about his daughter.

2
00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:08.240
Think about it, why would someone with such a lazy moral standard be a teacher?

3
00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:09.100
I want to ask my daughter to drop out of class.

4
00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:11.200
Why should this child be withdrawn?

5
00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:12.700
Fire this teacher now.

6
00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:14.780
No promise.

7
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:18.220
This person is not me, but the selfless me.

8
00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.100
Former teacher, you have forgotten everything you have done.

9
00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:23.560
You have a high voice, my husband, you are not an adult.

10
00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.400
What does it mean to be a high-pitched husband? You are obviously the heroine.

11
00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.620
It’s okay that your husband and I are the only adults.

12
00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:32.810
Parents, have you heard this clearly?

13
00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:34.340
am i really

14
00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.520
Is it true that you are married to someone else's husband?

15
00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:37.460
Do you want to connect

16
00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:39.320
It's obviously you who destroys other people's fake army

17
00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:40.320
Shut up, everyone

18
00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:46.970
You really don’t say that to my brother Kuai

19
00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:48.390
I was listened to

20
00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:49.530
Many people scold me

21
00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.380
It's all because of that damn gift. Don't be angry.

22
00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:55.100
Beware of emotional trends

23
00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.830
You Tang Li and I are so embarrassed

24
00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:00.650
Why haven't you married him yet?

25
00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:02.650
I can't do it because of a formal wedding

26
00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:04.069
Please take my company back

27
00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:06.640
I don’t have anything like your company.

28
00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.520
Uncle, of course you are more important than my company

29
00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.700
But I don’t know that my company has grown bigger

30
00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.520
Only then can I give you a better life

31
00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:17.790
It's better for you to argue with yourself again

32
00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.460
Oops, Brother Ten, don’t let your eyes wander to you.

33
00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:23.360
Shall we go to a meeting first?

34
00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:24.560
Then you agreed

35
00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:26.730
Remember, old man

36
00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:28.710
Pingjian, your relationship with his eye ruler

37
00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.210
I can definitely make an appointment with him

38
00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:32.320
Sorry brother,

39
00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.440
Are you going to give Xiaocheng a half body tomorrow? Why don't you go meet me?

40
00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:36.580
Let's add more

41
00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:38.160
Take it, help take it

42
00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.520
That party was boring

43
00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.860
I'm also acting defensively

44
00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:47.470
What about you? How about you wait for me at home?

45
00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:50.760
You don't appreciate it

46
00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:52.020
I still want to go

47
00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.660
Don't let everyone know

48
00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:55.080
I am the real host of you
