00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:04.200
Let's deal with cooking first.

2
00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:19.650
The expensive box was sealed and the deposit was entered. There was no one to borrow the child.

3
00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:22.890
It’s this fire, since God sent it to our hospital,

4
00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:24.660
Large attendance, children are not guaranteed.

5
00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:27.660
This is retribution, coming to deal with you.

6
00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:29.160
Do you really not know how to invite me?

7
00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:30.460
What are you asking for?

8
00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.800
Are you okay?

9
00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:34.710
By the way, I learned a couplets of poems from Kouko University.

10
00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:35.990
There is a video for sure.

11
00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.660
It was impossible for the boy in his previous life to play Dai.

12
00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.980
I looked up Xuehong’s various resolution reports.

13
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.420
He shouldn't just learn it.

14
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:46.510
What you mean is that he might be faking it,

15
00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:47.830
This possibility is not for nothing.

16
00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:51.360
She doesn't want to ask for advice.

17
00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:53.800
This is indeed her final state

18
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.900
Although a cold occurred before

19
00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.580
I'm always full of worry

20
00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:59.780
If you were Concubine Qin Ze, you would stink

21
00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:02.210
I’m congratulating you again and competing for a sample.

22
00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:06.450
And now you're miserable enough to lie here

23
00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:08.310
Not a single person came and went to hold the meeting.

24
00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:16.510
It's true that your mother got something out of it.

25
00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:18.610
Qin Qin also thought she would have a miscarriage.

26
00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.010
Do you know if you can make it?

27
00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:24.380
It doesn't matter

28
00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:26.580
I won't take care of you

29
00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.960
I changed my number and was taken away by her.

30
00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.340
As for your company

31
00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:32.500
I will also let people eat it

32
00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.240
Such a person

33
00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:39.660
You are so innocent
