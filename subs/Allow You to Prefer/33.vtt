00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:04.580
Do you want others to find out that we are not emotionally compatible?

2
00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:09.670
Lian Xinke can just go to the hill by himself.

3
00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:14.890
You're not sure either.

4
00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.210
First of all, thank you all for coming to my son's birthday party.

5
00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:22.670
Secondly, I want to thank my wife,

6
00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:24.970
I gave birth to such a cheerful son.

7
00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:28.890
I will definitely work hard in the future so that my son and my wife can

8
00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:30.610
Live a happy life.

9
00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.860
This is your son who is ready to be born, and you really want me to give birth to him.

10
00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.950
I have no idea.

11
00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.200
Mom, there should be no question about this sentence. The teachings of the previous life, please help me.

12
00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:59.420
Even if we have jobs

13
00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:00.700
Xu Zui also has a supporter

14
00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:02.810
Let you see it today

15
00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:05.430
Is Xu Ge right about that stroke?

16
00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:06.390
You yellow-faced pot

17
00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:08.450
It's better to hold on to this year

18
00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:15.020
Both of them are so young, right?

19
00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.000
It's for your mother to let you go and be a good person.

20
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.440
I'll give you a few

21
00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:21.640
Why are you here? Xu blame

22
00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.540
You tell him this today

23
00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:25.780
Who is the person coming back to you?

24
00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.820
Why did you go back first?

25
00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:29.440
Tianmen currently

26
00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.470
It still doesn’t mean anything to me

27
00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:32.370
Thank you to members

28
00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:33.890
Not sure it’s love

29
00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:35.100
It could also be a person

30
00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.120
Take advantage of the small town before it is released

31
00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:38.530
Nanjing’s cleanliness

32
00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:45.710
Have you contacted Qian'ancheng to see if he has?

33
00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.800
Before contacting Qian Anzhi

34
00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.370
Don't rush for goods in front of you all day long

35
00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:53.440
I'll give you three days to use

36
00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.340
I have to make peace with my ex

37
00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:57.660
Do you want to be Mrs. Xu?

38
00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:00.630
Good risks must be taken
