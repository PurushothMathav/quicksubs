00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:06.920
Husband, how did you find this place?

2
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.680
I saw you were injured yesterday.

3
00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:11.040
So I want to come to the hospital to buy you some antimicrobial medicine.

4
00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:13.400
Then I saw you going to the rooftop.

5
00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.550
I'll just follow him.

6
00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.520
Husband, do you still want to get up at that time?

7
00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.170
Leave the money for us,

8
00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:26.200
At that time, I was taking a job.

9
00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:34.150
Who were you just with?

10
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.940
I was alone just now.

11
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.790
You are born with someone who belongs to you.

12
00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.090
Then maybe after you went out and paid for it, your zodiac sign arrived, husband.

13
00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:02.650
It's okay. Husband.

14
00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:03.580
I suddenly remembered. I suddenly remembered. Think of it. Think of it. Think of it. Think of it. Think of it. Think of it. Think of it. Think of it. Think of it. Think of it. Think of it. Think of it.

15
00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:05.379
I also have the Prince of Medicine

16
00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:07.850
How about you go back first?

17
00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:09.470
Then I will wait for you

18
00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.060
Husband, you forgot

19
00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:18.000
Once there was a star pen

20
00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:21.640
And I have never bought acquaintance

21
00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:36.150
Ake is the president of Qingshi Group

22
00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.450
Love story about eating sister

23
00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:39.650
If our company can cooperate with Qingshi Group

24
00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:42.300
Cooperation will definitely bring us to a higher level

25
00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:51.350
Who are you to buy it?

26
00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:53.110
Mr. Zi, can you please give me a moment?

27
00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:54.220
I beg you

28
00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:55.320
I'll go to the next level

29
00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:57.250
How about giving it to us after you ask for it?

30
00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:59.540
Don't be sure

31
00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:01.650
Ben died beside you

32
00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:04.310
I'm very happy that I can pick it up. I still have it.

33
00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:07.860
The best medicine king, you say it, you say it

34
00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:08.850
Worthy of what you want

35
00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:10.009
I can give it to you

36
00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:12.460
Go tell the class the truth before leaving.

37
00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:15.480
You said it, I already know it

38
00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.240
When you just called them

39
00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:18.160
I heard it all

40
00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.640
He is a good person before work

41
00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:29.730
Just help him, right? Come back and feed Brother Bing.

42
00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:33.280
Do you still remember the waste of Zhou En that I owed you?

43
00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.720
Help me save the money and get it in place

44
00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:39.210
Everything is fine, just don't kill me

45
00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:40.410
Just make something

46
00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.650
If no one is there, I can take you

47
00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:51.510
Let me tell you the truth

48
00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:52.830
What did you say today?
