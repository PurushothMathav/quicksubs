00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:02.029
You end up being very careful with everyone.

2
00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:04.600
The ancient and modern trends must be similar to provide evidence.

3
00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.410
If you live in the city, then you have nothing to do.

4
00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:10.100
The ancient and modern trends must be similar to provide evidence.

5
00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:15.380
Sister, you are actually with another man.

6
00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:17.880
Whose is the only eldest child?

7
00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:32.680
But in the past few decades, have I been brought up by a wish?

8
00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:36.200
You actually brushed me off against my own son.

9
00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:45.800
If I don't check it, you will admit that I have offended you. You keep your eyes peeled

10
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:46.900
Not like this

11
00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:48.640
I didn’t buy it this way.

12
00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:52.000
I don't know you and us

13
00:00:58.780 --> 00:00:59.640
I will continue to re-offend with you.

14
00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:03.060
Remember what I said for a while

15
00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:04.099
Let me do it with all my heart

16
00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:05.860
They all made things difficult for me

17
00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:11.450
What do you think of them? It's nothing.

18
00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.530
Call for rules

19
00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:22.860
It’s not dad’s million feet

20
00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:27.620
I heard your conversation.

21
00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:29.470
You don't have to propose again

22
00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:30.560
Previously, because of the Lin family

23
00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.660
Throw out the battery over there

24
00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:41.940
What are you bringing me?

25
00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:44.990
That's what we decided this time

26
00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:48.140
In the future, we can’t do it just because we are still crazy.

27
00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.170
Play this marriage for the rest of your life

28
00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:02.180
Let's go watch it in the early morning now

29
00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:06.530
Now that I’ve seen it again, you can’t help but feel sorry for me, right?

30
00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:08.360
I will never fail him in my life
