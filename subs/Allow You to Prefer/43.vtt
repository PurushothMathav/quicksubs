00:00:02.009 --> 00:00:03.670
Then I beg you, let me go,

2
00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:05.470
I know I'm wrong first, and I just do it.

3
00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:07.710
Put it on, then I, I'll give you Weixiao, okay?

4
00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.070
Just let me go, let me go.

5
00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:11.830
You will take my and Xiao Chen's hands,

6
00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:14.210
Why haven't you ever thought about why you were so decisive in the first place?

7
00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:16.460
Then I don't. It's useless what you say now,

8
00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:19.580
I've given up. That's good,

9
00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:21.120
Will you die with me in a while?

10
00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:24.080
Ah, ah,

11
00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:32.320
Ah, ah, ah, ah,

12
00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.810
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah,

13
00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:42.410
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah,

14
00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:43.230
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah

15
00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:45.430
I saw the wrong light

16
00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:47.680
You hate me to death, right? Mr. Jing

17
00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:49.600
I didn't mean to hurt you with me

18
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:50.220
I want him

19
00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:51.280
But I am natural

20
00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:52.340
you want him to die

21
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:53.840
Don't want to die alive?

22
00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:55.440
Eat first, don't be fooled

23
00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.960
Among them, there is always news about your companyâ€™s death.

24
00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.040
Did I do it on purpose?

25
00:00:59.040 --> 00:00:59.680
injured with you

26
00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:00.220
chance for me

27
00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:00.940
I send you military will

28
00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:07.640
This is a public crime, so get out of here, right?

29
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:10.180
What a braggadocio.

30
00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:11.480
What do you mean?

31
00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:12.420
What's the meaning

32
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.200
Do you know if you just ask about the outcome?
