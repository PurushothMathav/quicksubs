00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:02.660
What do you mean? Take out the small money belt.

2
00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.720
Wife, I met you obediently, but I actually went out to the party.

3
00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:10.240
I praised Xiaocheng and told you.

4
00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:11.280
impossible.

5
00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:18.670
Is this pregnancy? Are you pregnant with me? When?

6
00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:22.510
You think so beautifully.

7
00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:24.530
There is no way in my life I will be pregnant with your child again.

8
00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:25.770
Whose is that?

9
00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:27.340
You're really out of pocket.

10
00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:28.590
Too expensive.

11
00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:29.930
You actually paid a lot of money.

12
00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:31.870
It won't kill you.

13
00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:33.280
If you pay too much, you will lose.

14
00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:34.660
You're really out of pocket.

15
00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:36.880
You come with me now to get rid of it.

16
00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:39.940
People actually know that I have been cuckolded, and now I am using it.

17
00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:44.440
It's my business not to bite big kids

18
00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:45.320
Nothing to do with you

19
00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:47.120
Don't penetrate me and eat you

20
00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:54.630
I lost my skills for you

21
00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:01.130
why are you here

22
00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.180
Do you want this company?

23
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:05.519
Be his only wolf, right?

24
00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:08.020
I can help you know earlier

25
00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:09.100
what did you say

26
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.220
This company belongs to Brother Xu

27
00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:13.200
How can I continue the public drama with Brother Xu?

28
00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.910
Whatever you do will work

29
00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:22.540
I originally wanted to say Xu Heng Ji Ji Ji Ji

30
00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:23.080
but i want

31
00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:32.130
This is one of the free questions

32
00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:41.140
Start flight first

33
00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:42.760
You gave up his darkness

34
00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.120
You can always take it back

35
00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:48.500
Okay, let me go to you

36
00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:00.280
After your cooperation is resumed

37
00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:01.250
He counts
