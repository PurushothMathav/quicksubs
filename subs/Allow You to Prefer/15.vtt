00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.300
You mean she didn't ask for information?

2
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.940
I still want photos, yes

3
00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:07.870
I have caused you to be in the middle

4
00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:09.550
Let her not have to do the completion certificate in the future.

5
00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:11.430
Continue to bear the midnight oil

6
00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:13.210
Please tell me right away, yes

7
00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:18.830
you gave me a surprise

8
00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:21.980
I also respond to you. I will finish it for you now.

9
00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.290
Go to a mobilization company

10
00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:34.400
How old are some people’s children?

11
00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.840
I even had a semi-official invitation with my colleagues.

12
00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:37.500
What do you mean

13
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.600
I'm not famous enough now

14
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.320
Does it seem like the air is jumping?

15
00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.160
Don't play with me about words and phrases

16
00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:44.840
An official office that does not do business here

17
00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:46.750
Ruozhong, I'm sorry.

18
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.320
You are the one who deserves the fruit

19
00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:53.960
You were fired. Tell me clearly.

20
00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.460
In the morning, someone revealed the marriage debt.

21
00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:58.960
Report you and Zhang An for going abroad

22
00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.460
Our company has banned young people in the office

23
00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:03.300
Total experience sent me to tell you

24
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.160
You are being treated less favorably than me

25
00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.100
There is no relationship between Wu Zhang and Zhang An

26
00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:08.760
What should I do to recall it myself?

27
00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:20.220
I just use it to talk

28
00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:22.390
I'm here to judge points and you hit me.

29
00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.120
My experience always says that I speak with my own hands

30
00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:26.360
Management still agrees

31
00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:29.470
I'll make the decision today

32
00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:31.110
The Queen doesn’t seem to welcome you

33
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.040
I changed my usual

34
00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:37.810
What's the matter? The general manager is here

35
00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:42.310
It is definitely necessary to teach without sin.

36
00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:46.480
You don't dare to leave

37
00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:47.530
If you leave

38
00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:49.210
Our company collapsed

39
00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:51.230
Mr. Lei, what do you mean?

40
00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:55.500
How come it must be a crime?

41
00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:56.820
Is our biggest independent hair

42
00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.830
I just received the training

43
00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:00.590
if i fire you

44
00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:03.500
I just want to point it out to you

45
00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:04.420
No, there are still some problems

46
00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:06.400
I really want to be in cahoots with you

47
00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.840
Let us destroy ourselves

48
00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:09.840
Come here welcome

49
00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.100
Qingzang, thank you for helping me vent my anger.

50
00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:20.850
You're welcome

51
00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.880
In fact, if you think

52
00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:27.200
If you are not happy, I can

53
00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.620
No, Mr. Qian, I think you misunderstood

54
00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:32.890
I have no problem with my old country

55
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.200
thank you for your relationship

56
00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:39.410
Besides, I don't need your help

57
00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:42.760
I can also solve the problems I face

58
00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:55.980
But love must be for this little bit of face

59
00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:02.030
Aren’t you saying you’re doing well? You’re so old

60
00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:04.510
follow your request

61
00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.060
Check-in Chairman's list that night

62
00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:07.730
It's all here
