00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:10.110
Drink and blow.

2
00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:12.990
Madam, you also learned about breakfast.

3
00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:16.680
For someone who has quit his family for the rest of his life, are you actually here to help?

4
00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.050
The sky is screaming.

5
00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:22.100
The sky is screaming. Heaven is here.

6
00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:25.460
Please tell me, Mr. Zaozhong Yisheng,

7
00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:30.510
It doesn't matter if you don't know anything.

8
00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.020
What's the meaning?

9
00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:33.900
What home? I know anything is possible.

10
00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:37.050
You promise today, you promise today,

11
00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:57.500
You promise today, you promise today, you promise today, you must promise,

12
00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.740
I can make myself speak.

13
00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:03.900
Madam, please remember our family.

14
00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:13.530
Take him with you, we will return to your station and he will not die.

15
00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:18.690
Sorry to disappoint you, please remember,

16
00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:21.030
It's not too late for you to follow the right path.

17
00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:22.490
You deceived thousands of people

18
00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:24.310
As long as there is any problem with money

19
00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:25.530
I asked you to change your life or change your life

20
00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:28.210
Money only needs to die

21
00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.090
But itâ€™s better to just die

22
00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:34.350
If he dies, no one will protect you.

23
00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:36.790
You've been diving like me

24
00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:38.210
Don't think about everyone

25
00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:39.750
As shameless as you

26
00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.350
Just go inside and take it with you

27
00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:43.360
I will find the most expensive theory

28
00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:45.470
I'll give you the heaviest sentence

29
00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:49.380
Various people take him down if

30
00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:07.880
You must establish management

31
00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.070
The sky has arrived

32
00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:16.250
It will take more than half a year

33
00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:18.480
Instead, they all call me daddy.

34
00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:20.010
There is also a small town

35
00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.220
His treatment is over

36
00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.750
You can see this group of relatives if you want

37
00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:29.290
You don't like it

38
00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:32.580
In fact, during this time I was thinking

39
00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.040
The first time you asked me to date you

40
00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:36.920
I should wait decisively

41
00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.360
There will be many things to do with you this way

42
00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:00.400
Do you like it? Just now
