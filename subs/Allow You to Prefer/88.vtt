00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:06.030
Finally I hate it, I want to quickly reply to the poem,

2
00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:11.190
The general is composed of songs, poems, and poems.

3
00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:13.050
You live here too, let alone practice.

4
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:15.980
Two books once, even if I live here,

5
00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:18.020
This house is so big that we don’t even live together.

6
00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:18.640
What are you worried about?

7
00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:28.230
This one was made by a woman. That's right.

8
00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.250
Eat first. Now I'm talking and practicing after dinner,

9
00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:32.080
If you want to see him, go there immediately.

10
00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:38.490
He will come later. I just ate this scrambled egg.

11
00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:40.730
Today, I flew to him and made him angry to death.

12
00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:48.330
Come, have your meal. Try the scrambled eggs I made,

13
00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:51.340
Eat a bowl of black tiger tiger stuff.

14
00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:53.310
Because I had the nerve to commit the crime and eat it

15
00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:56.640
Don’t be ashamed of what you have committed

16
00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.910
Are you eating together here?

17
00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.760
Just continue to deal with the offender

18
00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:02.220
you have broken up

19
00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:02.840
Don't lose it anymore

20
00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:04.340
I didn't agree to break up

21
00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:08.100
If you commit a crime, you will come back, right?

22
00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:09.740
Take a look at the door

23
00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.680
I'm already very disappointed in you

24
00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:13.520
While you are thinking about committing

25
00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.100
On the one hand, it’s good for Ling’s family

26
00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:16.970
How difficult is it for you?

27
00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:18.150
It's right that he doesn't want you

28
00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:18.930
I don't want it either

29
00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.560
You don’t have to pick at will

30
00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:25.630
Our relationship is so busy

31
00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.000
I'm really out of breath right now

32
00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:29.930
Wait until I finish all the things at hand

33
00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:32.380
Listen to things

34
00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:33.260
Tell you you are very busy

35
00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:35.360
If you are a man, please speak clearly.

36
00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:38.870
Even my mother-in-law and mother-in-law can't stand it.

37
00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:43.810
I'll give you something to eat later.

38
00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:45.820
The child is not dead

39
00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.240
People like me

40
00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:48.700
Just want to know where the child is

41
00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:50.400
Not one day recently

42
00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:54.200
What did you say

43
00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:55.910
Our child is still alive

44
00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:56.890
not dead yet

45
00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:00.040
know these things

46
00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:01.400
Emotions are over

47
00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:03.610
What do they say about living in front of that family?

48
00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.400
That's why I hid these things

49
00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.250
It’s not like you want to stimulate me today

50
00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:10.509
I won't tell either

51
00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:11.810
this one thing

52
00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:13.710
Everyone in Mingyue can see that it lasts a long time

53
00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:15.440
You are the only one guilty of having a second household registration

54
00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:22.260
I am also really from this family
