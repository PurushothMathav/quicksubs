00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:05.650
If you don't teach your mother-in-law how to do it when you meet her, she really hasn't taught you anything.

2
00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:09.290
Why are you here? This is my son's home,

3
00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.840
I can come and go whenever I want.

4
00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:15.080
But next time, I tell you,

5
00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:17.900
You must give birth to a boy this time,

6
00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:21.400
My crazy daughter-in-law is so good, I can’t let it go to waste.

7
00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:23.890
Sutra, what sutra?

8
00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.580
Is it someone else's favor or Wang Enfu's intention?

9
00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:32.280
You, this is the master,

10
00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:35.980
Give him son soup, and if you drink it, he will give birth to a boy.

11
00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.870
If you give me something to drink, I will bear a son by myself.

12
00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:41.900
There is this kind of house for me.

13
00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.100
What do you want to do, see the buyer again

14
00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.110
You marry my son

15
00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:49.510
All this belongs to my son

16
00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:50.830
Want to drive me away

17
00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:52.410
I'll call the police

18
00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:53.690
Let's see then

19
00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:55.380
Was it your son who caused the harm?

20
00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:57.090
Or am I hurting me?

21
00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.840
You, a woman who knows the window of the heart

22
00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:03.990
My dad too

23
00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:06.330
My wife still doesn’t want to drive me away

24
00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:12.430
Where can I put my old face? It’s okay, mom, mom.

25
00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:13.190
Mom, what's the matter with you?

26
00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.400
She’s not a good wife for you yet

27
00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.100
I finally made him chicken soup for him to drink.

28
00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.330
He took it away for me

29
00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:25.170
Erzi, I’m not alive anymore

30
00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.210
You must experience your breath

31
00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:29.330
Mom is so old

32
00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.050
Before you do anything with him

33
00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:32.610
Your mother is already this old

34
00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:33.710
Why don't you become a human being soon?

35
00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:34.970
What's wrong with my old face?

36
00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:42.660
Too high, I can't live anymore

37
00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:45.050
Mom this time

38
00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:46.690
He must be promoted to a boy

39
00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:47.840
After all upgrades are completed

40
00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.060
Divorce him on Luma

41
00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:52.480
Mom, this little person is almost

42
00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:55.710
I have found groups all over the world to meet

43
00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:58.280
Young, beautiful and rich

44
00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:00.880
Is it true that he would burn two cents for me?

45
00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:02.360
Then your attack is in vain

46
00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:03.240
How many kilograms and full heat

47
00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.140
He's a humble person

48
00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.000
His mother still has five pairs in her hand

49
00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.220
After I come back without cheating him,

50
00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:10.610
Just divorce him

51
00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:11.730
And it’s still me

52
00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:12.830
The son is smart

53
00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:20.720
Miscellaneous photo, it must be snow

54
00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:22.550
That's why he

55
00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:23.470
Send photos via Tongtong

56
00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:25.870
How different is he?

57
00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:49.190
There are some coincidences in the world, baby

58
00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:50.990
Since I want to eat there

59
00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:52.050
how to say

60
00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:53.740
He just went on a business trip

61
00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.840
All the big orders are waiting for him to pick up the extra ones.

62
00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.280
Wait for three more days at one o'clock

63
00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:59.200
Why is there any more?

64
00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.340
Regardless of me, he said that he could wear shoes with him

65
00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.910
It doesn’t matter if you want me back, husband.
