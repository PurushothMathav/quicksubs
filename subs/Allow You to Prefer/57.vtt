9
00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:34.060
Also for this little letter

10
00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:35.220
Make someone sad

11
00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:39.270
Otherwise, leave and I'll give it to you.

12
00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:41.010
Why are you back Wan Xiao?

13
00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:42.930
I heard something happened to you

14
00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.350
I can't wait to come back right away

15
00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:46.090
If it touches you and your children

16
00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:47.260
Definitely give it to me

17
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:50.200
you believe me

18
00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:57.360
I will always believe in you Wan Xiao

19
00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.250
will hurt you

20
00:00:59.250 --> 00:00:59.910
hope our

21
00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:07.880
I'm bullying you Ming Jiaqin

22
00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:09.260
Because he is my special person

23
00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:10.770
Is there any intention?

24
00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:25.890
I just need to put it away

25
00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.480
I got it back first

26
00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.780
Let's go eat together

27
00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:35.130
I'll take you to see someone

28
00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:36.580
if you don't go

29
00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:38.390
On the contrary, it makes you feel unfocused

30
00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.990
Yes, it's bigger than others

31
00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.490
This is my weapon

32
00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.980
You should call me sister-in-law

33
00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:58.140
What's good about me?

34
00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.060
This matter has not been implemented yet

35
00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:01.560
don't want it from your mouth

36
00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:04.710
I know after hearing these words

37
00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.810
Yan works for someone else

38
00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.699
Although I didnâ€™t push you downstairs,

39
00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:11.980
under my nose

40
00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:12.960
This kind of thing happens

41
00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:14.440
I'm really sorry

42
00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:17.720
As long as you apologize Yanzhi

43
00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:18.860
You came back so soon
