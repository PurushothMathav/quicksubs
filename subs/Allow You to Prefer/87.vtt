00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:06.590
No need to enter one

2
00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:09.080
Are you saying I'm overthinking?

3
00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:11.040
I just didn't find that there is still a problem.

4
00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:14.280
He Zhetang took Duzi

5
00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.500
I received a call from a relative.

6
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.290
Pull up the phone. Is this all Xiao He?

7
00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.380
Sister, I forgot about your phone.

8
00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:24.010
I just saw it in my memory

9
00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:25.930
How come a mobile phone is not a password?

10
00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:28.870
What if you connect your confidential documents and someone else sees them?

11
00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:30.910
I don't need any password for my phone.

12
00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:33.020
No one can see it.

13
00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:34.680
Of course, except for you, sister.

14
00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.660
You are getting better and better at talking, right?

15
00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:41.340
what do you want to say

16
00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:42.960
I won't hide it

17
00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:45.910
Today’s sugar is too fresh

18
00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.140
Why would you talk too much about that day?

19
00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:49.570
I'll make it for you again

20
00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:51.430
I'm not angry about everything

21
00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:52.550
As long as you do it

22
00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:53.190
I like them all

23
00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:55.010
Then what you say like this

24
00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:56.210
I feel relieved

25
00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:59.110
I'll go check it out and be hospitalized first.

26
00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.500
I'm overthinking some things

27
00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:05.930
I no longer only think

28
00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:07.580
It's quite substantial.

29
00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.650
It's you who dropped the ice in the middle of the night

30
00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.380
Help me, help me, help my family

31
00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:14.520
After eating

32
00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:15.900
Give you three hundred yuan

33
00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:17.490
Unexpected surprise from Dr. Bing Bureau

34
00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:18.800
Qingtong mobile phone

35
00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:21.560
There are actually other special monitors for this purpose

36
00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:23.830
Finally, we can know where Han Zi is in the world.

37
00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:25.270
He looks too tall too.

38
00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:27.870
Didn’t you say not to contact me?

39
00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.120
Why are you arresting me?

40
00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:32.620
Now that it has been explained

41
00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:37.350
to diarrhea

42
00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:44.710
Please check before receiving the request.

43
00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:45.650
The technology behind this

44
00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:46.570
Do you want to come forward?

45
00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:49.140
And remember all his recent stuff

46
00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:53.620
We should find someone soon

47
00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:55.100
I will also forgive my team
