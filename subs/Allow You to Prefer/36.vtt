00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.220
Xuhang, you’ve laid an egg,

2
00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:08.500
As long as I send this information out, you will,

3
00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:12.090
what's going on,

4
00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:14.720
Well, why are you here?

5
00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:16.600
What is this for?

6
00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.340
I'm so nervous,

7
00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.430
what to do,

8
00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:24.580
It's not a shame,

9
00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:26.080
I just came over to work overtime,

10
00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:29.200
being a cousin, in the past, several,

11
00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:31.420
The USB flash drive in Vice President Wang’s hand,

12
00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:33.300
It seems that there is something against you,

13
00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.020
No, this is just an ordinary USB flash drive,

14
00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:37.700
nothing,

15
00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:39.920
Because I really don’t know anything,

16
00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:41.680
What on earth did you do with the night shift workers?

17
00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:41.980
Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, you and the night shift are all changing. Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing. No, nothing, what are you doing?

18
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:46.880
Why don't you go out and ask someone to come?

19
00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:47.490
you listen to me

20
00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:56.640
Damn the doctrine

21
00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.140
Everyone opens my company to reward

22
00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:00.280
If you believe me, I will guarantee defeat.

23
00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:01.020
Give it to you

24
00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.200
I asked me to bare some books

25
00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:05.370
If you don’t hear it, I’ll cut you off at the same time.

26
00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:08.300
Listen to me, I don’t dare, I don’t dare

27
00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:10.430
Can you please forgive me?

28
00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:12.080
Even if it’s broken, you still want to say it

29
00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:26.560
Did the small incident happen with external funds?

30
00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:31.370
You will die. Your mentality is fine with mine.

31
00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:36.400
A lot of good ones

32
00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:37.540
I didn't get a good introduction

33
00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:38.840
Said that their company is better at selling imported drugs

34
00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:41.220
What about some tea?

35
00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:43.080
Xiaobai enthusiastic

36
00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:44.240
Okay, don't pretend to be a golden elixir.

37
00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:45.630
After all, you will be the guest

38
00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:46.650
Take away for investigation

39
00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:48.050
What to do with several false packages

40
00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.810
This big fish shop

41
00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.570
You're not just good at eating food

42
00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:56.770
Weren't you taken away, little seed?

43
00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:58.090
not that easy

44
00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:59.490
Wang Zhihao, come here

45
00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:00.230
all culpability

46
00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:01.790
Of course I have no products

47
00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:02.890
See why

48
00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:05.660
Have you ever been sick?

49
00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:07.880
stop crying

50
00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.240
Paul Mo who took care of his children

51
00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:10.240
is my person

52
00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:11.280
I give you a call

53
00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:13.740
The child will not die.

54
00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.800
It's you who makes me think I'm a composite

55
00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.500
Prepare one million for me immediately

56
00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.680
Otherwise, Huizi wouldn’t even want to see Xiao Chen
