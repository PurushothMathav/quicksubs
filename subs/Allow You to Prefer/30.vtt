00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:02.600
It's okay, I just don't know myself,

2
00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:04.820
Suddenly I thought,

3
00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:07.860
Are you predestined?

4
00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:11.710
What are you doing?

5
00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:16.500
In this way, you will be with us all waiting for me to look back.

6
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.660
Then it can't be a hundred minutes.

7
00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.260
It has been restored for two months

8
00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:23.340
The body is relatively weak

9
00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:25.410
What would it be like if you rest, rest, rest?

10
00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:26.930
I returned my wish

11
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:32.259
Maybe I've been in the first month, why aren't you still willing to become Hugh?

12
00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.110
It's done

13
00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:36.610
But Zhou En said he was not free

14
00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:38.270
Is there anyone else?

15
00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:39.490
enter my room

16
00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:41.770
Why is it such a big door?

17
00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:44.010
Can't you please help me?

18
00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:53.700
The damage to your body is too great. I'll call you.

19
00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.590
Then get up and wait for my mother to show up.

20
00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:00.480
Your mother's is still useless

21
00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:01.780
I have solved it

22
00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:03.300
I have found the best doctor in Xinzang

23
00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:05.980
Come and help your mother with the surgery. Don’t worry.

24
00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:07.830
Thank you Tiansa

25
00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:10.780
But I want to find out why Xuhen Chugui is there as soon as possible

26
00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:12.820
Is it true that false hatred pays off?

27
00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:17.840
Half a month ago, you went to save me with false hatred for a month

28
00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.320
Now you Miao Lihui, right?

29
00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:25.040
No chance

30
00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:27.170
Give me a chance

31
00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:29.380
Don't be kidding when you give it to me

32
00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:30.950
We will still think about it

33
00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:33.420
Never pursued it before

34
00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:36.120
It's co-produced by me and I'll give you one as a gift soon.

35
00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:40.540
it's me now

36
00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:41.980
I'm all kidding you

37
00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:45.630
It doesn’t matter if you don’t know what you are

38
00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:02.180
Now we have to talk about the company, remember

39
00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:03.840
There can't be anything

40
00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:17.960
You can find a real estate agent

41
00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.910
Fuck you kid

42
00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:38.940
She can be in the same room with you as I say

43
00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:40.060
Finally how much

44
00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:45.680
Then it depends on when you will get divorced.

45
00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.420
When are you willing to cooperate with me?

46
00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.350
Then since you don't want to go to me

47
00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:53.570
I will tell you now

48
00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:54.570
Bring your company into the public eye

49
00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:57.550
Isn't this a joke to you?

50
00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:59.950
You're such a pampered young lady

51
00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:01.680
It’s enough to hear that you’re heartbroken

52
00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:02.970
That's your own

53
00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:04.400
You are yellow and green fire

54
00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:05.610
There are more ghosts if you get higher

55
00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:08.260
Finally I got caught
