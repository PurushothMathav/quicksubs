00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.060
Go tell Mr. Qin,

2
00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.780
Her woman, for Bo Yang’s house,

3
00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:10.940
Things are so troublesome that I wish you a great wish,

4
00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:24.280
It's her,

5
00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.600
Are you the antidote?

6
00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.320
Dad, that's the antidote. How to antidote?

7
00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.090
As soon as Xu Hong gave you the medicine, she wanted to set up a trap for you and Miss Ye.

8
00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.470
Are you looking for someone to love her?

9
00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:41.630
Why are there so many scenes before the last issue?

10
00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:44.170
How can you find out from experience? It can be said that your family is behind the scenes.

11
00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:52.990
I have,

12
00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:54.860
My dear, Miss Ye and Mr. Wen,

13
00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.300
It seems to be opening up,

14
00:00:58.300 --> 00:00:59.960
Say it again,

15
00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.600
Miss Ye and Mr. Wen,

16
00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:03.600
open again,

17
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:04.900
I design again, the language behind the scenes,

18
00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:10.520
It's Wei Lu

19
00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:12.370
So confident that 80% of the time

20
00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:13.850
That’s quite a lot to talk about.

21
00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:15.520
in front of so many people

22
00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:16.360
This heart can be lost

23
00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.420
Let's go and see

24
00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:20.970
I showed you early in the morning

25
00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:22.520
Do you really like it?

26
00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:30.320
It’s not necessary to be realistic

27
00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:31.650
I didn't know that

28
00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:33.880
Not actually put into the sea

29
00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:37.260
what is going on

30
00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:39.380
Where are you going?

31
00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.260
Did I think something was wrong?

32
00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:44.280
What do you want to do?

33
00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.220
didn't you see

34
00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:46.820
I've already lost my true knot

35
00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:47.420
I wonder how it is possible

36
00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:48.500
Sleeping with Lin Yisheng for everything

37
00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:51.270
How do I know to tell you

38
00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.970
I'm really angry

39
00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:54.960
I slept peacefully in the room

40
00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:57.020
When I woke up, I was talking to a girl next to me

41
00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:58.210
I didn't say what to do
