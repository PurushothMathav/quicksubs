00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:03.400
You shameless thing

2
00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:05.466
There was such a big commotion today

3
00:00:05.933 --> 00:00:08.033
How big is the person who let you lose the pine tree?

4
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:10.400
Apologize to him, I'm right

5
00:00:13.266 --> 00:00:13.900
That's the lesson.

6
00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:15.166
You don't know what's good

7
00:00:15.733 --> 00:00:17.866
He lost face in front of the wealthy families of Sea City

8
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.900
This is to tell you to make a scene at the venue

9
00:00:22.166 --> 00:00:23.766
Now Mr. Shen is not coming

10
00:00:23.966 --> 00:00:25.633
An opportunity to embarrass our Su family

11
00:00:26.733 --> 00:00:28.633
Mom, don't call me mom

12
00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:32.066
It's okay to lose money, don't hit it.

13
00:00:34.333 --> 00:00:36.800
Since this wild master entered our Su family

14
00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.333
Just keep getting bad luck

15
00:00:38.333 --> 00:00:39.566
He's a disaster

16
00:00:39.566 --> 00:00:41.633
Somebody kick him out for me

17
00:00:45.133 --> 00:00:47.966
The clothes on him are also from our Su family.

18
00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.600
Strip him naked and throw him out

19
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.300
It is so nice of you.

20
00:00:54.966 --> 00:00:55.766
let go

21
00:00:56.333 --> 00:00:57.633
Let go of me!

22
00:00:58.466 --> 00:01:00.700
What are you watching me do?

23
00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:02.066
Keep you honest

24
00:01:02.066 --> 00:01:03.366
Give you face

25
00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.800
If you don't come or leave, I'll hit you

26
00:01:06.333 --> 00:01:07.266
let go

27
00:01:08.766 --> 00:01:10.266
Think I'll go

28
00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.633
But you broke my fish.

29
00:01:14.866 --> 00:01:15.666
i

30
00:01:15.966 --> 00:01:16.833
Here you are.

31
00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.166
Oops, you've got the wrong number.

32
00:01:36.166 --> 00:01:38.666
Calm down prodigal girls

33
00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.600
You know you hurt our Su family this time

34
00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:41.900
How much did you lose?

35
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.300
Sir, this belongs to Miss Jiang Li

36
00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:47.600
There is a diary of his

37
00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.300
And some take away and show me what these are for

38
00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:51.866
All bad luck

39
00:01:52.066 --> 00:01:53.066
Wait a minute.

40
00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.000
diary

41
00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.766
I have a brother at the orphanage today

42
00:02:04.766 --> 00:02:07.400
What is it called?

43
00:02:08.166 --> 00:02:09.600
What is the richest man in the world?

44
00:02:10.466 --> 00:02:11.566
That's impossible.

45
00:02:11.733 --> 00:02:13.166
That must be smart.

46
00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.166
What nonsense are you talking about, Yaruo?

47
00:02:16.166 --> 00:02:19.500
How could that little bitch know the richest man in the world?

48
00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.933
Ah, let's talk about Mr. Shen?

49
00:02:21.933 --> 00:02:24.466
How could he have been in an orphanage?

50
00:02:24.466 --> 00:02:26.233
It must be the same name

51
00:02:26.866 --> 00:02:29.300
The image of Shenmo has been exposed according to reliable sources

52
00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:30.800
Shenmo will change it to

53
00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:31.966
Is looking for recording

54
00:02:31.966 --> 00:02:34.500
A childhood sweetheart who grew up in an orphanage

55
00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.133
The two of them had already settled down at the orphanage

56
00:02:37.133 --> 00:02:40.166
This time I went back to the orphanage to promise calmly

57
00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.100
Isn't this the waiter from yesterday?

58
00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:44.700
Ah, Mr. Shen, the richest man in the world

59
00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.400
Joey, this bitch, actually knows Mr. Shen
