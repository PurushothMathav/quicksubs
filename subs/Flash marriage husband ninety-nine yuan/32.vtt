00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:02.166
Hey, sorry, sorry, sorry.

2
00:00:02.166 --> 00:00:03.866
Miss Jiang is quite right.

3
00:00:03.866 --> 00:00:05.300
Mr. Jiang, Mr. Jiang, I'm sorry, right?

4
00:00:05.333 --> 00:00:07.766
They forced me to fire you

5
00:00:07.766 --> 00:00:08.733
You hit people and don't go to the villain to cry

6
00:00:08.733 --> 00:00:10.066
Please forgive me this time

7
00:00:10.066 --> 00:00:11.100
I was wrong. I was wrong.

8
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:12.300
I don't want to go back to this job.

9
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:13.366
Our whole family

10
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.200
I'm begging you, Mr. Qiao

11
00:00:18.466 --> 00:00:21.033
If you hadn't told me in the first place

12
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.633
Design in the future

13
00:00:23.766 --> 00:00:25.566
Whoever dares to take you back

14
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.433
Who is my father Liu Jianguo?

15
00:00:28.533 --> 00:00:30.500
Let me go first

16
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.966
Brother Mo, what the hell are you doing?

17
00:00:42.966 --> 00:00:45.966
I will stand up for you.

18
00:00:46.466 --> 00:00:49.233
No one can bully my wife, be honest

19
00:00:49.866 --> 00:00:52.366
Did you already know that Shengshi involves

20
00:00:52.366 --> 00:00:53.066
And to be scrutinized

21
00:00:53.066 --> 00:00:55.233
Is there any news of the acquisition?

22
00:00:56.566 --> 00:00:58.733
I said, no wonder you yesterday

23
00:00:58.733 --> 00:01:00.400
Late, you still made a fuss with me about designing the facility

24
00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:01.200
Give it to me.

25
00:01:01.733 --> 00:01:04.600
It turned out that it was Gut Zhu who told you that kind of news

26
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.100
It seems he still can't accept my true identity

27
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.900
Brother Mo Dog's work is not divided into high and low

28
00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:15.433
I don't mind if you earn less.

29
00:01:16.266 --> 00:01:16.533
So

30
00:01:16.533 --> 00:01:18.866
You don't have to use your social connections to handle it for me anymore

31
00:01:18.866 --> 00:01:20.100
Me?

32
00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.300
I just don't want you to work so hard.

33
00:01:23.466 --> 00:01:25.366
Brother Meng Bo, you have to believe me

34
00:01:25.533 --> 00:01:28.700
I believe you are older than me and capable of supporting this family

35
00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:29.400
Ute lives there

36
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.333
You tell him

37
00:01:30.333 --> 00:01:32.866
Don't give me the location of the general manager of facility design

38
00:01:32.966 --> 00:01:34.500
I have to rely on my own efforts

39
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.266
Become an industry graduate

40
00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:41.000
Honey, how cool are you?

41
00:01:41.866 --> 00:01:43.100
Right?

42
00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:51.800
Hello, Xiao Li

43
00:01:51.933 --> 00:01:53.500
I heard you got your license

44
00:01:53.866 --> 00:01:55.800
How did you know

45
00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.000
Not your mother

46
00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.900
The whole world preaches that you followed a poor boy

47
00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:00.300
And scolded you for kicking people backwards

48
00:02:00.333 --> 00:02:01.066
I'm pissed off.

49
00:02:01.066 --> 00:02:03.466
Come to Shangdao Coffee and explain it to me quickly.

50
00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.700
I'm not at work yet. How can I come?

51
00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.233
If you don't come within 10 minutes, sister, you don't have to do it.
