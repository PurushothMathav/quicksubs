00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:04.300
Somebody drag them down and bury them, baby

2
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:07.500
You have a big tone

3
00:00:08.133 --> 00:00:10.500
You stinky fish seller, are you courting death?

4
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.100
Ah dad, this girl is going to stay

5
00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:14.900
I want 52 you to shut up

6
00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:16.900
Wow you are stupid why are you hitting me

7
00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:18.833
This kid is useless

8
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.366
Don't kneel down and apologize to him

9
00:00:20.466 --> 00:00:22.500
Dad, are you all right?

10
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.766
Even if I am your illegitimate child

11
00:00:24.766 --> 00:00:27.966
You asked me to give ghosts to such inferior people and poor people

12
00:00:27.966 --> 00:00:30.566
The legend is that the reputation of our old Wei family is unclear

13
00:00:30.866 --> 00:00:32.633
You said you don't want it?

14
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.900
Are you blind?

15
00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:36.666
Do you know who they are?

16
00:00:36.766 --> 00:00:37.700
People are still

17
00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:39.533
Our Wei family's industry will be doomed

18
00:00:39.533 --> 00:00:39.966
You know what?

19
00:00:39.966 --> 00:00:42.066
Your company has to go back and sit on the table with others

20
00:00:42.066 --> 00:00:43.500
Live together in the underground pool

21
00:00:43.733 --> 00:00:46.600
If he's so awesome, can he drive a car and sell fish?

22
00:00:47.166 --> 00:00:48.566
He doesn't sell fish.

23
00:00:48.566 --> 00:00:50.000
This store is mine

24
00:00:50.566 --> 00:00:51.866
I'm the one selling the fish

25
00:00:51.866 --> 00:00:52.666
he

26
00:00:53.466 --> 00:00:55.966
He doesn't sell fish

27
00:00:56.933 --> 00:00:59.033
Dad, don't be angry.

28
00:00:59.066 --> 00:01:01.000
I, I, I'll apologize to him.

29
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.000
I'll apologize to him

30
00:01:02.266 --> 00:01:03.066
This lady

31
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.166
You asked your husband to let me go

32
00:01:05.166 --> 00:01:07.800
Let me go, okay, Ah Wei?

33
00:01:09.333 --> 00:01:12.366
Your son just made me kneel down and teach him dog lessons

34
00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:14.500
Don't let people learn from dogs

35
00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.966
I learn, I learn, I learn, I learn.

36
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.266
Wow, wow, wow.

37
00:01:22.333 --> 00:01:24.000
Hey, are you satisfied?

38
00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.866
If you are not satisfied

39
00:01:24.866 --> 00:01:27.133
I let him kneel here and learn to bark a dog for a day

40
00:01:27.133 --> 00:01:28.000
One month.
