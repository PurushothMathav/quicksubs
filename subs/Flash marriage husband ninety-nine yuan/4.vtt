00:00:04.133 --> 00:00:06.300
I can finally stay with my mother

2
00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:09.300
I'm finally not the child no one wants

3
00:00:13.366 --> 00:00:14.166
that

4
00:00:16.266 --> 00:00:19.000
The old lady finally hugged a rich old man

5
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.166
Make the dike small

6
00:00:20.166 --> 00:00:21.800
15 years

7
00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.700
The original match finally died

8
00:00:23.866 --> 00:00:26.433
She's about to become Mrs. Su

9
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.166
The result is because of you

10
00:00:29.333 --> 00:00:31.033
It's all ruined now

11
00:00:31.766 --> 00:00:33.966
You shouldn't have been born in the first place

12
00:00:34.133 --> 00:00:35.100
It doesn't matter.

13
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.900
Mom must be angry

14
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:38.800
Brother Mo said

15
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Mothers love their children

16
00:00:42.733 --> 00:00:45.166
If it weren't for you?

17
00:00:45.566 --> 00:00:47.833
Can I live in a shitty place like this?

18
00:00:48.533 --> 00:00:50.566
All because of you

19
00:00:51.666 --> 00:00:53.233
Why don't you die?

20
00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:59.300
Beautiful woman, come out

21
00:01:03.366 --> 00:01:05.300
The old lady will come back and clean you up later.

22
00:01:05.733 --> 00:01:08.066
Hey, here we go.

23
00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.433
Brother Meng, my mother doesn't seem to love me at all

24
00:01:21.366 --> 00:01:22.566
Dream brother

25
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.566
I miss you so much!

26
00:01:27.466 --> 00:01:28.300
Your name is Jiang Li

27
00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.000
Uncle Su, what's the matter with you?

28
00:01:44.166 --> 00:01:46.200
She looks just like your mother

29
00:01:46.766 --> 00:01:47.566
Po

30
00:01:48.366 --> 00:01:52.033
Are you better than him?

31
00:01:52.966 --> 00:01:55.900
Why are these little hands so thick?

32
00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.666
A lot of rough work, right?

33
00:01:57.666 --> 00:01:58.900
Ah uncle listen

34
00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.200
I'm shy.

35
00:02:04.866 --> 00:02:10.166
Will you still be a chef?

36
00:02:10.766 --> 00:02:12.066
Ah!

37
00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.166
Hahahaha

38
00:02:19.733 --> 00:02:21.833
Hahahaha

39
00:02:24.133 --> 00:02:24.933
Adi

40
00:02:25.966 --> 00:02:26.766
Help!

41
00:02:27.466 --> 00:02:28.866
Where the hell are you?

42
00:02:32.066 --> 00:02:33.500
Why is my heart suddenly shaking so much?

43
00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:35.033
Could it be that

44
00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:39.966
Adi has an accident

45
00:02:46.533 --> 00:02:49.400
Immediately speed up the search is Mr. Shen

46
00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.900
earth

47
00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.666
You mustn't lose it.
