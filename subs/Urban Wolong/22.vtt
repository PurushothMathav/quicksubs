00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:02.166
Did you find out what happened to the Lin family?

2
00:00:02.166 --> 00:00:04.200
What did you find?

3
00:00:04.466 --> 00:00:06.700
The Lin family has been attacked by mysterious forces overseas

4
00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:07.766
Economic collapse

5
00:00:07.766 --> 00:00:09.466
Now on the brink of bankruptcy

6
00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:10.866
But in order to find support

7
00:00:10.866 --> 00:00:14.133
They decided to marry Lin Bingjiao into Jin Haisun's family

8
00:00:14.133 --> 00:00:16.266
But Lin Bingjiao doesn't seem willing

9
00:00:17.533 --> 00:00:19.633
Overseas mysterious forces

10
00:00:20.566 --> 00:00:22.266
Immediately order the nine gods of war

11
00:00:22.266 --> 00:00:25.966
I want 3,000 dragons to come to Qinghai to stand by

12
00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:30.766
People who dare to touch me

13
00:00:30.766 --> 00:00:32.566
I will kill you.

14
00:00:47.566 --> 00:00:48.800
What are you doing here?

15
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
I heard your neighbor's having some trouble.

16
00:00:51.266 --> 00:00:52.566
I'm here to help you.

17
00:00:52.666 --> 00:00:55.566
Can you help me see the door?

18
00:00:55.566 --> 00:00:56.700
Tell me a number.

19
00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.800
How much does it cost to bring your neighbor's wife back to life?

20
00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:00.900
That's enough!

21
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.033
Don't coax me with your clumsy tricks

22
00:01:03.366 --> 00:01:04.400
Do you think

23
00:01:04.666 --> 00:01:06.666
You can finally win my heart if you are rich

24
00:01:06.666 --> 00:01:07.566
Got it.

25
00:01:07.566 --> 00:01:09.900
You're only making me feel more disgusted by doing this

26
00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.400
I really regret not finding a single beggar last night

27
00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.300
Instead, I found a rascal like you

28
00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:16.900
How can you believe me?

29
00:01:18.066 --> 00:01:20.500
Get away and I'll believe you

30
00:01:21.533 --> 00:01:22.333
Yo

31
00:01:23.266 --> 00:01:24.300
It's all here.

32
00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:25.666
Hahahaha

33
00:01:25.666 --> 00:01:27.400
That's easy to handle.
