00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.333
I remember now.

2
00:00:01.333 --> 00:00:03.800
You said you were a friend of Zhan Shuai

3
00:00:03.866 --> 00:00:06.100
Yes, if you are a friend of Zhan Shuai

4
00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:07.966
Why did you go to KTV to be a waiter?

5
00:00:07.966 --> 00:00:09.400
Because three months ago

6
00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:11.000
The fortune teller told me

7
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.566
Let me come to Gimhae's KTV

8
00:00:12.733 --> 00:00:14.600
Waiting for someone I've been looking for for years

9
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:15.966
How naive!

10
00:00:16.066 --> 00:00:17.666
Believe what the fortune teller says

11
00:00:17.666 --> 00:00:19.233
Really go to KTV and wait

12
00:00:19.266 --> 00:00:21.066
What the fortune teller says is true

13
00:00:21.066 --> 00:00:22.566
Really amazing

14
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.500
Why did you wait for the person you were looking for?

15
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.400
Yes, I waited.

16
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:28.566
Who are you?

17
00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.333
You are waiting for me

18
00:00:30.333 --> 00:00:31.766
What are you waiting for me to do?

19
00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.166
Do you remember this?

20
00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.133
What is this?

21
00:00:37.133 --> 00:00:38.300
Over 10 years ago

22
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.766
A little boy was beaten up at a roadside stall

23
00:00:40.766 --> 00:00:43.066
A little girl rushed over to stop the police.

24
00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.900
The little girl took this handkerchief and polished the little boy's shoes.

25
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:47.100
When the little girl left?

26
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.100
Leave this handkerchief to the little boy

27
00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.733
From then on, the little boy was well preserved

28
00:00:51.733 --> 00:00:52.766
When he grew up

29
00:00:52.766 --> 00:00:54.866
Daddy must marry this little girl

30
00:00:54.866 --> 00:00:56.366
Protect him forever

31
00:00:56.366 --> 00:00:57.566
I remember now.

32
00:00:57.566 --> 00:00:59.266
It was Fatty Wang who beat the man

33
00:00:59.266 --> 00:01:01.266
His house was worse than mine at that time

34
00:01:01.266 --> 00:01:03.966
But his dad is doing a great job now

35
00:01:03.966 --> 00:01:06.566
Why is that you who was beaten up?

36
00:01:06.566 --> 00:01:08.066
That's right, it's me.

37
00:01:08.133 --> 00:01:09.000
I didn't expect it.

38
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.666
How can you remember these little things for so many years?

39
00:01:11.666 --> 00:01:14.633
In my life, I will take revenge and repay kindness

40
00:01:14.766 --> 00:01:17.366
I thought you were a braggart

41
00:01:17.366 --> 00:01:19.000
I didn't expect you to fight for advantages

42
00:01:19.366 --> 00:01:22.866
After you contact me for a long time, you will find that I am very serious.

43
00:01:23.133 --> 00:01:25.633
Do you really know Tuan Zhuan?

44
00:01:25.766 --> 00:01:29.166
Yes, you said Zhan Shuai will come to Jinhai tonight.

45
00:01:29.166 --> 00:01:31.533
Will stay in the Presidential Suite at the Regal Hotel

46
00:01:31.533 --> 00:01:32.366
It's also true.

47
00:01:32.366 --> 00:01:33.866
Of course.

48
00:01:33.866 --> 00:01:35.066
Then I will trust you again.

49
00:01:35.066 --> 00:01:36.900
I'll go see if it's true
