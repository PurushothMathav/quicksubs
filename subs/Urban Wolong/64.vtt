1
00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.166
What are you solving for us?

2
00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:05.166
What are you?

3
00:00:06.133 --> 00:00:07.700
If in Jinhai

4
00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:09.633
Only one person can hold back his dignity

5
00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:11.633
It can only be me

6
00:00:14.366 --> 00:00:15.866
How arrogant

7
00:00:15.866 --> 00:00:16.666
Hey

8
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:18.233
Hey

9
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.066
Village Chief, come here

10
00:00:20.166 --> 00:00:21.333
Come in quickly

11
00:00:21.333 --> 00:00:22.600
Not in front of me

12
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:23.900
You want me to connect it together.

13
00:00:24.866 --> 00:00:27.433
Lin Junhai just said

14
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.466
The fact that my son was injured

15
00:00:29.466 --> 00:00:31.466
You have to give an explanation

16
00:00:31.733 --> 00:00:32.566
Oh, President Sun

17
00:00:32.566 --> 00:00:34.133
We are innocent

18
00:00:34.133 --> 00:00:36.866
Didn't the neighbor hurt Sun Shou?

19
00:00:36.866 --> 00:00:37.900
This is the push-up.

20
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.933
It was his self-righteousness that offended him

21
00:00:41.933 --> 00:00:45.133
Hmph, why did he hurt my son?

22
00:00:45.133 --> 00:00:47.000
Yes yes yes that's him

23
00:00:47.066 --> 00:00:49.500
Boy is a wolf

24
00:00:49.533 --> 00:00:51.633
Dare to hit my son of Sun Sihai

25
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.166
I advise you to lift the sanctions imposed by the Shan Society on the Lin family

26
00:00:55.333 --> 00:00:56.900
Then apologize to me

27
00:00:57.133 --> 00:00:58.300
Get out of here

28
00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:03.166
Otherwise, there will be no more Sun family in the entire Jinhai

29
00:01:03.166 --> 00:01:05.500
Arrogance is arrogance

30
00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.466
I'd like to see what kind of energy you have

31
00:01:08.466 --> 00:01:09.766
Can there be no Sun family?

32
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:10.800
Good idea.

33
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:14.233
Then let's start by removing you as the president of the chamber of commerce

34
00:01:14.366 --> 00:01:17.633
You, a waiter, want to fire the president of my chamber of commerce

35
00:01:18.066 --> 00:01:20.833
Hahahahahaha

36
00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:22.433
ridiculous

37
00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:24.100
You don't believe

38
00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:25.600
letter

39
00:01:26.266 --> 00:01:27.800
Why should I believe

40
00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:31.066
Well done with your service

41
00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:34.566
Good, very good.

42
00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:36.600
Humph
