00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.466
It caught me so much.

2
00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:02.866
I want to make a phone call

3
00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:05.300
Let the instructor catch you

4
00:00:05.333 --> 00:00:08.066
It's good to catch me

5
00:00:08.166 --> 00:00:10.966
I'm here waiting for you to call someone to catch me

6
00:00:11.133 --> 00:00:13.366
Oops, I'm in pain.

7
00:00:13.366 --> 00:00:14.933
Take me to the hospital

8
00:00:14.933 --> 00:00:18.500
Hurry up and send the teacher to the hospital

9
00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.833
What are you doing in a team?

10
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.133
Come quickly

11
00:00:31.133 --> 00:00:32.866
Somebody stopped at my house.

12
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.366
He hit Sun Shang

13
00:00:36.166 --> 00:00:37.466
Just go.

14
00:00:37.533 --> 00:00:38.800
What to go

15
00:00:38.866 --> 00:00:40.800
I'm here to propose marriage

16
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.133
Just daydream.

17
00:00:42.133 --> 00:00:43.300
despicable

18
00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:44.666
Never want to marry my daughter

19
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.200
Just don't look in the mirror

20
00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.100
You are a toad of any breed

21
00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.500
If you knew where I came from

22
00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.300
I'm afraid I'll be scared to death

23
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.400
Who's that?

24
00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.466
Sweeper in KTV?

25
00:00:57.466 --> 00:00:59.433
He is still a sweeping monk

26
00:00:59.533 --> 00:01:01.066
Sweeper bachelor

27
00:01:01.066 --> 00:01:04.266
I don't care about you for Bing Jiao's sake

28
00:01:04.266 --> 00:01:07.200
As long as you promise me to be with Bing Jiao now

29
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.166
I can help you solve the difficulties of your neighbors

30
00:01:10.733 --> 00:01:12.966
Ah you help us solve problems

31
00:01:12.966 --> 00:01:14.266
Did you split it?

32
00:01:14.266 --> 00:01:16.366
You are a waiter without a car or a house

33
00:01:16.366 --> 00:01:18.633
What do you have to solve our problems?

34
00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:22.200
how

35
00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.066
Someone next door helped you, so just pay the money back.
