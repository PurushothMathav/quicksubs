00:00:00.733 --> 00:00:02.900
What? I'll be right back

2
00:00:04.133 --> 00:00:06.166
What's the matter, you beat up Mr. Sun?

3
00:00:06.166 --> 00:00:08.633
He is afraid of taking his anger out on our Lin family's eastward travel relationship

4
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.700
Cut off all the voices in our Lin family

5
00:00:11.933 --> 00:00:15.233
This guy surnamed Sun is really courting death

6
00:00:15.666 --> 00:00:17.500
Go, I'll follow you.

7
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.866
Dad, it's all your fault

8
00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:31.300
What's the situation now?

9
00:00:31.566 --> 00:00:32.766
What's going on?

10
00:00:32.766 --> 00:00:34.966
Now the Sun family has mobilized the design of the entire chamber of commerce

11
00:00:34.966 --> 00:00:36.766
Banned our Li family

12
00:00:36.766 --> 00:00:38.166
Upstream supply channels

13
00:00:38.166 --> 00:00:41.066
All downstream purchase channels have been intercepted.

14
00:00:41.166 --> 00:00:42.833
How could they do that?

15
00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:44.833
Do you still have a face?

16
00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:47.100
If you hadn't had to sit down together on push-ups

17
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.700
How could you do this yourself

18
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.866
What are you doing with this push-up?

19
00:00:50.866 --> 00:00:52.233
Get out of here

20
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.300
If you still want me to help you overcome the problem

21
00:00:55.466 --> 00:00:57.066
Better be polite to me

22
00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.100
What are you solving for us?

23
00:01:00.266 --> 00:01:02.200
What are you?
