00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.233
I don't care who you are.

2
00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:05.033
Get out of here

3
00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.166
Sister-in-law, what did you say?

4
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.266
I said you'd better get out of here

5
00:00:14.333 --> 00:00:15.766
Don't make me angry.

6
00:00:15.966 --> 00:00:20.133
Damn, you are a mouse sleeping cat, are you looking for death?

7
00:00:20.133 --> 00:00:22.533
Have you ever asked me about my background?

8
00:00:22.533 --> 00:00:25.100
How dare you speak to me in such a tone?

9
00:00:25.733 --> 00:00:28.333
Then I'll cooperate. Why do you love him?

10
00:00:28.333 --> 00:00:30.066
Do you know Ghost?

11
00:00:30.866 --> 00:00:32.633
Never heard of hum

12
00:00:32.966 --> 00:00:34.633
No wonder he's so arrogant

13
00:00:34.666 --> 00:00:36.866
I've never even heard of Ghost

14
00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:38.433
Ten years ago.

15
00:00:38.533 --> 00:00:42.100
There are two people like thunder on the rivers and lakes

16
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:43.133
one

17
00:00:43.133 --> 00:00:47.500
Killed 300 assassins overnight

18
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.700
Another one was caught in jail and bullied by his father

19
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.766
He flattened the prison overnight

20
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.433
These two people are Lord Nan Gui

21
00:00:59.566 --> 00:01:01.200
North British Columbia

22
00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:05.833
Who do you think you can offend these two people?

23
00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.266
I can't offend anyone

24
00:01:08.766 --> 00:01:11.400
But those two people you just told me about

25
00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.500
It's not even a dish in front of me

26
00:01:15.533 --> 00:01:17.066
As long as you meet me

27
00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.266
He will kneel

28
00:01:19.966 --> 00:01:22.266
Hahahahaha

29
00:01:22.966 --> 00:01:25.633
I'm afraid you're going to laugh at me to death, right?

30
00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.333
You say you don't look good either

31
00:01:28.333 --> 00:01:31.066
Why are you talking so ignorant?

32
00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:34.133
Fresh old man, if you don't beat it, you are looking for your teeth all over the place

33
00:01:34.133 --> 00:01:35.966
I'm not capable

34
00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:38.900
Just join me in this little role

35
00:01:39.866 --> 00:01:43.300
Boy, it's not too late for you to kneel down and beg for mercy now
