00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:01.533
You don't have to worry about me.

2
00:00:01.533 --> 00:00:05.000
I can help you deal with any trouble you encounter.

3
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.800
It's really big talk and won't jam your teeth

4
00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:09.133
Can you handle it?

5
00:00:09.133 --> 00:00:10.466
Why do you deal with it?

6
00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:13.700
Did you do a good job with your service?

7
00:00:14.133 --> 00:00:16.900
You are a perennial hanging out in night clubs

8
00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:19.300
A woman who posts up when she sees a man

9
00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.300
What right do you have to speak to me in this tone?

10
00:00:22.333 --> 00:00:24.100
What did your waiter say outside?

11
00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:26.266
You also know that I am a waiter

12
00:00:26.266 --> 00:00:27.533
And say I'm talking nonsense

13
00:00:27.533 --> 00:00:29.233
I'm on the same KTV.

14
00:00:29.466 --> 00:00:30.266
I have seen you

15
00:00:30.266 --> 00:00:33.300
Left ten times to hook up with different men

16
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.866
Doing shady things in the corner

17
00:00:35.866 --> 00:00:37.833
You serve so well.

18
00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:39.700
High tech

19
00:00:39.866 --> 00:00:42.366
How dare you slander my grandfather

20
00:00:42.366 --> 00:00:43.933
He dared to pour dirty water on me

21
00:00:43.933 --> 00:00:45.466
Hurry up and beat him out for me

22
00:00:45.666 --> 00:00:47.400
Hey, don't squeeze the bowl

23
00:00:48.333 --> 00:00:49.866
I'll help you clean him up

24
00:00:51.166 --> 00:00:53.100
Don't talk about Jiushanmen being so unbearable

25
00:00:53.566 --> 00:00:55.433
It can make you unbearable

26
00:00:55.533 --> 00:00:57.166
Is there a possibility

27
00:00:57.666 --> 00:01:01.066
It's because they simply don't have enough for me to fight

28
00:01:01.066 --> 00:01:02.400
Anyway.

29
00:01:03.266 --> 00:01:05.766
Touched my woman and it was the first time

30
00:01:05.766 --> 00:01:07.300
I won't let you go

31
00:01:07.366 --> 00:01:09.500
If I wasn't more advanced than you

32
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.366
I don't like your stuff

33
00:01:11.366 --> 00:01:13.700
All the women you like

34
00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.500
I can sleep for you

35
00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.033
Believe it or not, it's a hand-chopping show

36
00:01:19.466 --> 00:01:20.266
addiction

37
00:01:20.466 --> 00:01:22.900
Maim this humble waiter for me

38
00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:23.833
Throw it out
