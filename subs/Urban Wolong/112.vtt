00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.300
God of War

2
00:00:02.766 --> 00:00:04.066
Sun Dechuan

3
00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:06.566
It's okay, the dragon god of war is here

4
00:00:06.566 --> 00:00:08.733
It just so happens that someone here is pretending to be the commander of war

5
00:00:08.733 --> 00:00:09.800
The weather has no god of war

6
00:00:10.066 --> 00:00:11.200
Take them down now

7
00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.000
I'll give you a shit.

8
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.100
Brother, I am a real war commander

9
00:00:15.533 --> 00:00:17.066
Are you sure what I just shouted?

10
00:00:17.066 --> 00:00:20.300
Ah, it's true, it's true.

11
00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.000
You are a general

12
00:00:22.066 --> 00:00:24.500
Not only does he lack even the most basic intelligence

13
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:25.900
It was lawlessness.

14
00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.066
It seems that you start today

15
00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:30.233
The good times are over

16
00:00:30.533 --> 00:00:31.800
Lord Shuai, please forgive me.

17
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.700
I really didn't expect you to be in a place like this

18
00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.933
I didn't expect you to act so ordinary

19
00:00:36.933 --> 00:00:38.166
I can't bear it

20
00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:39.433
Please forgive me.

21
00:00:39.766 --> 00:00:42.133
Why, if I wasn't the war commander

22
00:00:42.133 --> 00:00:44.900
You can just grab me and shoot me

23
00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:46.733
What do you think of the common people?

24
00:00:46.733 --> 00:00:48.666
What do you take Wang Fa for?

25
00:00:48.666 --> 00:00:49.600
Ah, I was wrong.

26
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:50.366
Beg for my life!

27
00:00:50.366 --> 00:00:53.466
Dear, I'm sorry, I was wrong.

28
00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.800
To spare evildoers is the greatest evil

29
00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.366
I can't spare you.

30
00:00:59.533 --> 00:01:02.300
Take him down to the dark prison

31
00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.466
Forgive me, brother, I was wrong.

32
00:01:04.466 --> 00:01:06.200
Big brother, help!

33
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.400
Big brother

34
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:08.466
Help!

35
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.800
Hmph now I know I'm afraid hey

36
00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.200
You deserve to go first

37
00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.633
I was talking to my future wife about getting married

38
00:01:21.766 --> 00:01:23.366
My proud lady

39
00:01:23.366 --> 00:01:27.200
Now will you marry me?
