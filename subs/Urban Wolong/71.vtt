00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.400
Why are you already my woman?

2
00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:03.866
Are you afraid to let me hold hands?

3
00:00:03.866 --> 00:00:07.600
I just wanted to make my family angry about what happened last night

4
00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:10.366
Why don't you think I'm more handsome?

5
00:00:10.366 --> 00:00:12.133
Do you like me a little bit?

6
00:00:12.133 --> 00:00:13.333
You are really narcissistic

7
00:00:13.333 --> 00:00:15.266
I am a famous beauty in Gimhae

8
00:00:15.266 --> 00:00:17.866
The unattainable iceberg female president

9
00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:19.466
Will like you a rich student

10
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:20.866
So what do you like?

11
00:00:20.866 --> 00:00:23.300
I like people more than you

12
00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.000
That's one in the sky and one on the ground.

13
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.166
Can only make you look up

14
00:00:26.166 --> 00:00:27.300
Oh, it does?

15
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.733
Say it and let me hear it

16
00:00:28.733 --> 00:00:29.966
Oh, no.

17
00:00:29.966 --> 00:00:32.033
Say it and let me look up

18
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:33.333
Know at that time

19
00:00:33.333 --> 00:00:35.766
Who is the man who is as dazzling as a legend?

20
00:00:35.766 --> 00:00:36.533
I know.

21
00:00:36.533 --> 00:00:37.800
Isn't that me?

22
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.666
You are.

23
00:00:39.666 --> 00:00:40.500
In my eyes

24
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:41.333
Except me.

25
00:00:41.333 --> 00:00:42.366
No second man

26
00:00:42.366 --> 00:00:43.966
It is as dazzling as a legend in the world

27
00:00:43.966 --> 00:00:46.266
You're really bragging about not paying taxes.

28
00:00:46.266 --> 00:00:47.666
Although what happened last night

29
00:00:47.766 --> 00:00:49.400
It does make me feel good about you.

30
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.200
It also makes me think you have some ability

31
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.966
But your narcissism really makes me hate it

32
00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.566
In your heart

33
00:00:55.566 --> 00:00:56.766
You should still think

34
00:00:56.766 --> 00:00:58.333
The man you like in your heart

35
00:00:58.333 --> 00:01:00.200
Is it the best in the world?

36
00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:01.400
Of course!

37
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:02.300
There's no question about it.

38
00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.900
I really want to know who that man is

39
00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:06.033
Then say it.

40
00:01:06.066 --> 00:01:08.333
Have you heard of Zhan Shuai?

41
00:01:08.333 --> 00:01:10.133
Hahaha what?

42
00:01:10.133 --> 00:01:12.400
You said the man you like is Zhan Shuai
