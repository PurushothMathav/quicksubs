00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:01.066
youth

2
00:00:02.866 --> 00:00:06.033
Don't worry, I'll be out soon.

3
00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.700
You want to come out after being popular and hurting people

4
00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:12.900
You used my detention center as a vegetable market

5
00:00:13.166 --> 00:00:15.566
I'll rest assured on the spot.

6
00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:17.466
Let's go in again.

7
00:00:17.866 --> 00:00:20.233
There is no good fruit to eat and take away.

8
00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:23.166
Open the door

9
00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:27.400
Get in

10
00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:31.766
Hahaha so hungry dog

11
00:00:31.766 --> 00:00:35.966
It seems that you really don't cry without seeing the coffin

12
00:00:35.966 --> 00:00:37.433
That's it.

13
00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:38.966
Or else

14
00:00:39.333 --> 00:00:43.600
Did you know that your life will be ruined today?

15
00:00:43.766 --> 00:00:45.200
God what did you say

16
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:46.833
You are going to destroy me

17
00:00:46.966 --> 00:00:50.000
Yes I'm going to destroy you to pieces

18
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.900
Eternal Doom

19
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.633
Hahahaha

20
00:00:54.533 --> 00:00:56.633
Ha really made me laugh

21
00:00:57.533 --> 00:00:59.766
What are you capable of catching the ball alone?

22
00:01:00.133 --> 00:01:02.166
You want to know what energy I have?

23
00:01:02.333 --> 00:01:05.500
Think about it, take out your energy and see

24
00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:06.766
If so

25
00:01:07.133 --> 00:01:10.000
I have a hard row in my pocket

26
00:01:10.333 --> 00:01:12.066
Take it out and take a good look.

27
00:01:12.066 --> 00:01:14.000
You have a sign in your pocket.

28
00:01:14.466 --> 00:01:17.833
You don't want to say you are a delegate, do you?
