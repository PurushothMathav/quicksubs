00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Ouch.

2
00:00:08.266 --> 00:00:09.066
Sir?

3
00:00:09.333 --> 00:00:11.766
What's the matter, we just arrested someone

4
00:00:11.966 --> 00:00:13.666
He took out a token

5
00:00:13.666 --> 00:00:14.700
Please show me the truth.

6
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.833
What token?

7
00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:18.400
Get it now

8
00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:26.433
Oh my god

9
00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.666
What happened to the conversion?

10
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.700
Hurry up where is the person you said

11
00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:32.866
It's downstairs.

12
00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:33.666
What's the matter sir

13
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.366
Really big shot?

14
00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.233
You're courting death

15
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.033
More than just big shots

16
00:00:39.066 --> 00:00:40.666
He's a real deal maker.

17
00:00:40.666 --> 00:00:43.033
Take me there now

18
00:00:44.733 --> 00:00:46.766
Who is calling him?

19
00:00:47.133 --> 00:00:48.166
Kyushu Zhanshuai

20
00:00:48.166 --> 00:00:49.466
Ask them to be safe

21
00:00:52.533 --> 00:00:54.766
The boy is still pretending to be calm

22
00:00:54.766 --> 00:00:57.600
The captain will be back in a while to see how you died

23
00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:58.800
I think so.

24
00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:00.433
It should be you who died

25
00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.133
Still catching Lao Tzu

26
00:01:02.133 --> 00:01:04.800
If you don't smoke today, you can't be sorry for my temper

27
00:01:05.333 --> 00:01:06.300
Stop

28
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.466
Chief, captain, you are back
