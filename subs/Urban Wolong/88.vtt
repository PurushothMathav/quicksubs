1
00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.966
OK, then I'll trust you again.

2
00:00:02.966 --> 00:00:04.800
I'll go see if it's true

3
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:06.966
you

4
00:00:08.533 --> 00:00:10.833
Why don't you want to marry me?

5
00:00:10.866 --> 00:00:13.233
I'm really moved to hear you say that

6
00:00:13.366 --> 00:00:16.700
But we are not from the same world after all

7
00:00:17.566 --> 00:00:19.400
Why not someone from the same world?

8
00:00:19.866 --> 00:00:21.033
No reason.

9
00:00:21.066 --> 00:00:24.400
Maybe my heart belongs to someone else

10
00:00:24.966 --> 00:00:28.100
It seems that you still like Zhang Shuai

11
00:00:28.566 --> 00:00:29.366
OK

12
00:00:30.166 --> 00:00:31.500
It's deeply ingrained.

13
00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:33.266
Fine

14
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.766
Since some things cannot be forced

15
00:00:36.866 --> 00:00:38.266
I'll give up

16
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.633
I wish you find your own happiness

17
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.366
I'll see you at the Regal then.

18
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.366
If you know the name Qing Dynasty

19
00:00:53.366 --> 00:00:55.466
Ann's waiter is Zhan Shuai

20
00:00:55.566 --> 00:00:56.833
What will happen to you?

21
00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.800
Zhan Shuai really came to Jinhai

22
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.066
Do you live here?

23
00:01:08.266 --> 00:01:12.000
Otherwise, there is no need to tell this lie in love

24
00:01:22.566 --> 00:01:24.766
Warrior, do you really live here?
