1
00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:02.900
Come on, it's cheaper for you.

2
00:00:16.266 --> 00:00:20.400
Anyway, I mean not to marry him

3
00:00:20.533 --> 00:00:23.300
Let's have a wedding with him today

4
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.600
The ice cellar seems to be our fate

5
00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.666
I will definitely treat you well in the future.

6
00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:55.733
What are you doing

7
00:00:55.733 --> 00:00:58.000
You give me a drink in the wine yourself

8
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.233
I forgot the medicine you gave yourself.

9
00:01:06.566 --> 00:01:08.366
Get out if it's cheap

10
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.700
Don't be disgusting here

11
00:01:09.866 --> 00:01:11.600
You are already mine

12
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.100
I will be responsible for you.

13
00:01:13.333 --> 00:01:15.166
Don't think about toads eating swan meat

14
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.566
It is impossible for me to marry a floating life

15
00:01:19.466 --> 00:01:22.166
Why did your family force you to marry a wicked young man?

16
00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.266
Does it have anything to do with you?

17
00:01:24.733 --> 00:01:27.600
Maybe I can help you?

18
00:01:28.133 --> 00:01:29.500
You helped me.

19
00:01:29.566 --> 00:01:31.966
I don't know where you got the courage to talk nonsense here

20
00:01:32.133 --> 00:01:33.566
A KTV waiter

21
00:01:33.566 --> 00:01:35.600
You actually want to help me with a wealthy president
