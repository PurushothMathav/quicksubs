00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.900
Wang Shi greets Lord Qingfeng

00:00:04.066 --> 00:00:05.900
Ah Minister of Breeze

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.666
God of War Qingfeng, meet Zhan Shuai, Zhan Shuai

4
00:00:14.266 --> 00:00:16.433
Exemption, yeah

5
00:00:17.066 --> 00:00:18.466
What's going on here?

6
00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:20.466
He is a KTV waiter

7
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:22.333
How could it be Zhan Shuai?

8
00:00:22.333 --> 00:00:23.800
He won't be casually on KTV

9
00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.666
Find a girl to play it

10
00:00:26.566 --> 00:00:27.400
Ouch.

11
00:00:29.533 --> 00:00:30.766
How dare you hit me?

12
00:00:30.766 --> 00:00:32.100
Don't say hit you

13
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:33.566
So what if I kill you?

14
00:00:35.166 --> 00:00:36.933
Grandpa Yue, please help me

15
00:00:36.933 --> 00:00:38.833
He actually hit me in your face

16
00:00:39.966 --> 00:00:41.866
You unsatisfactory thing

17
00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:42.800

18
00:00:43.866 --> 00:00:46.400
See how grandpa even hits me

19
00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.900
You can't help it, you idiot

20
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.166
You even dare to provoke Lord Qingfeng

21
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.466
You know who Lord Qingfeng killed

22
00:00:53.466 --> 00:00:55.233
More people than you've ever met?

23
00:00:55.266 --> 00:00:56.400
Oh, no.

24
00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.833
Zhan Shuai is the scariest person in the world

25
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:01.866
Lord Qingfeng

26
00:01:02.566 --> 00:01:04.566
Is he really here?

27
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.233
How dare you question me?

28
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:09.600
dare not dare

29
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.600
Wang Si deserved to die

30
00:01:12.366 --> 00:01:13.366
Angry god of war

31
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.600
Please forgive me, God of War
