00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:01.433
Do you know?

2
00:00:02.766 --> 00:00:03.833
Breeze order

3
00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:06.433
Do you still recognize the Breeze Order?

4
00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:08.100
How dare you!

5
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:09.933
How dare you pretend to be the Qingfeng God of War?

6
00:00:09.933 --> 00:00:10.733
Humph

7
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:13.466
Impersonation, isn't it?

8
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.366
You say you are the messenger of the battle

9
00:00:15.366 --> 00:00:18.166
If you can't take out the messenger order, it's a pro-order.

10
00:00:18.166 --> 00:00:19.800
How many tokens do you plan to have?

11
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.366
Did you touch the wrong hand?

12
00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:22.900
You are not a warhead

13
00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.700
Arrange the four kings and nine gods of war

14
00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:27.966
All belong to the commander

15
00:00:27.966 --> 00:00:29.633
History of war marshal

16
00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:31.000
outrageous

17
00:00:31.133 --> 00:00:33.066
I am the dignified Governor

18
00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:35.700
How could you not know this?

19
00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:36.966
You are clearly bubbling

20
00:00:37.166 --> 00:00:39.066
Looks like I have to call

21
00:00:39.066 --> 00:00:42.766
Let Long Aotian, the god of war of Jinhai, come in person

22
00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.166
Good explanation actually dares to say that the Dragon God of War will come in person

23
00:00:47.166 --> 00:00:49.266
Do you know the identity of the Dragon God?

24
00:00:49.266 --> 00:00:51.933
He is a direct confidant of the strategic lord

25
00:00:51.933 --> 00:00:55.000
What qualifications do you have to order the Dragon God of War?

26
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.966
Hmph, are you qualified? I'll know in a while.

27
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.300
Rong Aotian?

28
00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.300
I have something to do at the neighbor's house now

29
00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:05.566
Come here right now

30
00:01:06.866 --> 00:01:10.100
He'll come over later and prove it to you.

31
00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:11.900
Hum I wait

32
00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:13.166
Take care of him first

33
00:01:13.166 --> 00:01:14.900
Don't let him take the opportunity to slip away

34
00:01:15.333 --> 00:01:18.433
Is it reasonable for my son to be completely accounted for?

35
00:01:18.533 --> 00:01:20.366
I'll do the math first
