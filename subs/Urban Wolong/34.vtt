00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:03.266
Can I take my fiancee away now?

2
00:00:03.266 --> 00:00:04.300
Hey come come come

3
00:00:04.366 --> 00:00:05.433
Must come

4
00:00:06.333 --> 00:00:07.433
Father-in-law

5
00:00:07.733 --> 00:00:09.600
Wife, let's go

6
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:11.433
Don't you think it's a good son-in-law?

7
00:00:11.866 --> 00:00:13.866
Let's go! He can't go!

8
00:00:14.566 --> 00:00:15.266
What do you mean?

9
00:00:15.266 --> 00:00:19.166
I just want to take my wife and father-in-law away

10
00:00:19.166 --> 00:00:21.133
He's just a waiter

11
00:00:21.133 --> 00:00:22.866
Why do you have my face?

12
00:00:22.866 --> 00:00:25.700
He and the Street Fighter Club Nine Kills

13
00:00:26.133 --> 00:00:27.566
Solve it yourself

14
00:00:28.333 --> 00:00:29.166
Let's go

15
00:00:31.733 --> 00:00:35.166
Even if he has crossed the river in Duniposa, don't worry about him

16
00:00:35.566 --> 00:00:36.366
go go

17
00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.766
Sling, now you're dead

18
00:00:43.766 --> 00:00:45.533
Kneel down and talk to me now

19
00:00:45.533 --> 00:00:48.700
My parents never made me kneel in this world

20
00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:51.966
Even heaven and earth can't make me kneel

21
00:00:51.966 --> 00:00:53.700
What are you?

22
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.233
Also deserve to make me kneel

23
00:00:55.333 --> 00:00:57.266
What did you say boy

24
00:00:57.266 --> 00:00:58.166
What did I say?

25
00:00:58.166 --> 00:00:59.366
Are you deaf?

26
00:00:59.366 --> 00:01:03.100
I advise you to get out of here before I kill you

27
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.600
Otherwise, wait for my people to come

28
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.933
You will die without a place to see

29
00:01:07.933 --> 00:01:08.966
Pardon me?

30
00:01:09.566 --> 00:01:11.000
Who are your people?

31
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.600
He said he had energy

32
00:01:12.766 --> 00:01:13.900
Also called someone

33
00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:18.000
He also said that you can face it with a wrench, right?

34
00:01:18.866 --> 00:01:21.200
A waiter can yell at someone

35
00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.700
Call a bunch of waiters

36
00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.800
Haha die of laughter

37
00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.466
Lao Tzu has been serving the world for decades

38
00:01:27.466 --> 00:01:30.500
I've never heard of anyone calling a waiter like this

39
00:01:30.933 --> 00:01:32.466
To kill me
