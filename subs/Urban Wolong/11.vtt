00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.866
What KTV waiter?

2
00:00:03.866 --> 00:00:06.066
Yes, Lin Bing teaches you.

3
00:00:06.066 --> 00:00:07.100
Now it's falling

4
00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:09.800
I ended up with a KTV waiter

5
00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:11.700
I'm so disappointed.

6
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.766
It's not that I was forced

7
00:00:13.766 --> 00:00:16.100
Forced what?

8
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:17.633
He forced you

9
00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.866
It's not that my family forced my family

10
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.000
How did your family force you?

11
00:00:23.266 --> 00:00:24.566
My dad lost a gamble

12
00:00:24.566 --> 00:00:27.166
The company owes huge debts and goes bankrupt

13
00:00:27.166 --> 00:00:29.733
They forced me to marry a famous scumbag in Gimhae

14
00:00:29.733 --> 00:00:30.800
Young Master Sun

15
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:31.933
I don't want to

16
00:00:31.933 --> 00:00:34.966
So I thought about finding the most unpromising man

17
00:00:34.966 --> 00:00:36.366
Destroy yourself

18
00:00:37.766 --> 00:00:39.266
Then I happened to be here

19
00:00:39.333 --> 00:00:43.433
I can solve all your troubles

20
00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:46.700
Really, God of War, are you willing to help me?

21
00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:49.100
I'm willing to let you be my woman

22
00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.000
Naturally willing to help you

23
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.333
Is it really okay?

24
00:00:52.333 --> 00:00:54.600
I just happened to put medicine in the wine

25
00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.100
Ok ok

26
00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.200
The little detective doesn't go away by himself

27
00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.233
Could it be that you want to see Lao Tzu give you a live performance?

28
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.066
I'll tell you what.

29
00:01:08.066 --> 00:01:12.033
The war commander is a hero and an impostor is a capital crime
