00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.966
You said I was going to die today, didn't you, boy?

2
00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:05.500
Don't think you can shoot down a weapon

3
00:00:05.766 --> 00:00:08.866
The energy of my Sun family is not something you can mess with

4
00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:12.200
The energy of the Sun family is nothing in front of me

5
00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.000
I'll give you three seconds.

6
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.200
Kneel down again and apologize

7
00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.200
I'll let you walk on one leg.

8
00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:18.100
otherwise

9
00:00:18.733 --> 00:00:21.866
You're in a wheelchair for the rest of your life

10
00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:23.866
What are you?

11
00:00:23.966 --> 00:00:25.833
Also worthy of making me kneel

12
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:28.700
It seems that you are not allowed to cry

13
00:00:31.866 --> 00:00:35.033
Ah you always save me let go

14
00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:36.366
You celebrate my birthday

15
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:37.500
Stop it now

16
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:38.633
Squat down and apologize

17
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:39.700
Believe it or not

18
00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.666
I let the whole gold medal underground world squat for you

19
00:00:42.966 --> 00:00:44.500
What I want to do

20
00:00:44.666 --> 00:00:48.233
Even if the gods come, they can't stop them

21
00:00:49.066 --> 00:00:50.033
Ah!

22
00:00:51.266 --> 00:00:52.100
Ah!

23
00:00:56.366 --> 00:01:00.066
Well, you'll be in a wheelchair for the rest of your life

24
00:01:00.066 --> 00:01:03.500
This devil my dad won't let you go

25
00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.166
Stop talking about your dad

26
00:01:05.366 --> 00:01:07.966
Even if the eighteenth generation of your ancestors came to me

27
00:01:07.966 --> 00:01:10.633
I also let them turn into ashes and go back

28
00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.100
You compliment me too much.

29
00:01:12.266 --> 00:01:16.066
I'm going to call the instructor to kill you
