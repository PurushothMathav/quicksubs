00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:01.166
What about 5 million?

2
00:00:01.166 --> 00:00:02.366
Don't pay it back

3
00:00:02.366 --> 00:00:04.466
Just take it as my apology to you.

4
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.233
Is that okay?

5
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:07.433
Ah!

6
00:00:08.066 --> 00:00:10.766
Ah, don't pay it back.

7
00:00:11.166 --> 00:00:12.333
Is it really okay?

8
00:00:12.333 --> 00:00:13.533
Yes, yes.

9
00:00:13.533 --> 00:00:15.900
As long as you don't take offense to democracy.

10
00:00:17.366 --> 00:00:20.100
Then it won't be returned.

11
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.366
Okay, then it won't be returned.

12
00:00:23.066 --> 00:00:24.966
Dragon Lord, sorry to bother you.

13
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.200
Then I'll go first

14
00:00:35.166 --> 00:00:37.133
Even Lord Ghost gives you face

15
00:00:37.133 --> 00:00:39.000
What the hell do you do?

16
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.766
It doesn't matter who I am

17
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.500
As long as you marry them to me today

18
00:00:44.166 --> 00:00:47.666
I can keep your Lin family safe for life

19
00:00:47.733 --> 00:00:48.533
Humph

20
00:00:49.066 --> 00:00:51.466
Boy, don't brag

21
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.033
It's great to think there's something to do with it

22
00:00:55.666 --> 00:00:57.233
I also want the forest ranger to be comprehensive

23
00:00:57.933 --> 00:00:59.466
Oh, right.

24
00:00:59.466 --> 00:01:02.266
Didn't you hand over the director of the Nanjing Bureau of Commerce?

25
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:03.900
Hey man

26
00:01:04.866 --> 00:01:08.766
What's the hurry? He's not a bird and can fly over.

27
00:01:08.866 --> 00:01:10.666
More time

28
00:01:11.333 --> 00:01:15.066
Jinhai is only 40 minutes from the south of the city to the north of the city

29
00:01:15.933 --> 00:01:17.766
It's been 20 minutes

30
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.833
I'll give you another 20 minutes.

31
00:01:20.133 --> 00:01:22.566
If others haven't come yet

32
00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:24.566
Then I declare

33
00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:25.500
Lin Jia

34
00:01:26.166 --> 00:01:28.566
Oh, please don't, Sophie Lord

35
00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.200
He was an outlaw.

36
00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:31.900
I don't know how high the world is

37
00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:33.300
I drove him away

38
00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:34.800
Will you spare us?

39
00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.566
Our boy, don't brag at the neighbor's house.

40
00:01:37.566 --> 00:01:40.566
Do you want to hurt us? Just go away

41
00:01:40.566 --> 00:01:42.000
Big black morning
