00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:05.166
Come and send Lidan

2
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.866
Sun Shao proposed to the lady next door to the refrigerator

3
00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:12.166
A Jinhai rocking chair is specially given.

4
00:00:12.366 --> 00:00:15.400

Two for missiles

7
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.266
Plus cash 1 billion

8
00:00:25.266 --> 00:00:26.700
It's all like Caolin

9
00:00:27.166 --> 00:00:27.466
This this

10
00:00:27.466 --> 00:00:28.933
It should be theft.

11
00:00:28.933 --> 00:00:30.933
Maintain the most expensive gift in the world

12
00:00:30.933 --> 00:00:32.766
Tell me about it.

13
00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:35.600
This goes beyond the concept of wealth

14
00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.233
Take weapons as an example

15
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.266
Is that a super powerful town?

16
00:00:40.266 --> 00:00:41.900
Oh my god

17
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.366
Now my uncle Shen Jiu general

18
00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.000
As long as you can take pride

19
00:00:47.466 --> 00:00:49.766
I will give him the greatest honor

20
00:00:49.766 --> 00:00:52.700
Look at how good Sun Shao is

21
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.500
You drugged yourself to a waiter?

22
00:00:55.533 --> 00:00:58.366
But fortunately, Sun Shao has the bearing.

23
00:00:58.366 --> 00:01:00.766
Otherwise, you will regret it for the rest of your life

24
00:01:00.766 --> 00:01:01.666
Okay.

25
00:01:02.566 --> 00:01:05.066
He gave the first time to the waiter

26
00:01:05.333 --> 00:01:06.733
Don't mention it again

27
00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:08.833
Does Lao Tzu feel blurry when he thinks about it?

28
00:01:09.066 --> 00:01:11.333
Yes, yes, don't say it, don't say it

29
00:01:11.333 --> 00:01:12.400
How about it?

30
00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.666
You gave your first time to that waiter

31
00:01:15.966 --> 00:01:18.733
Would you mind giving me the rest?

32
00:01:18.733 --> 00:01:20.133
Can I be honest?

33
00:01:20.133 --> 00:01:21.133
When?

34
00:01:21.133 --> 00:01:23.900
I still miss the taste of my first love

35
00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:25.766
No interest in other men

36
00:01:26.266 --> 00:01:29.466
What, you still miss the waiter?

37
00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.166
Icehouse, are you crazy?

38
00:01:32.166 --> 00:01:35.566
Yeah, didn't you forget that idiot possessed

39
00:01:35.566 --> 00:01:37.666
He actually offended the Stuttering Society and the Nine Kills Sect

40
00:01:37.666 --> 00:01:39.000
Almost got us killed

41
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
If it weren't for San Shao's rescue, we would be finished

42
00:01:43.266 --> 00:01:45.300
That's right, my good sister.

43
00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:47.966
You can't be ungrateful.

44
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.766
Sun Shao saved you, you should give yourself to him

45
00:01:50.766 --> 00:01:52.666
It's the right thing to do.
