00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:01.200
Come come

2
00:00:02.066 --> 00:00:05.000
How is the condition good?

3
00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:06.866
Thanks.

4
00:00:10.566 --> 00:00:11.366
waiter

5
00:00:19.166 --> 00:00:22.866
Give me all your most expensive and best dishes

6
00:00:22.866 --> 00:00:24.433
Good to go

7
00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.500
Come on, don't be so nervous

8
00:00:28.533 --> 00:00:29.533
No, please.

9
00:00:29.533 --> 00:00:32.466
All the consumption today will be paid by me, Wushao

10
00:00:32.566 --> 00:00:33.366
How is that possible?

11
00:00:33.366 --> 00:00:35.966
Wu Shao, this has to be my invitation, hey

12
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.000
How can I ask you to please?

13
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.300
I have dinner with girls

14
00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.466
But never imitate those useless men

15
00:00:43.466 --> 00:00:45.233
Let the girl pay the bill.

16
00:00:46.933 --> 00:00:49.233
Don't feel like you have some money

17
00:00:49.733 --> 00:00:51.400
Can be amazing

18
00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.800
This meal is on me

19
00:00:54.933 --> 00:00:56.700
What do you mean, kid?

20
00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.600
You are a waiter who has been pinched by others.

21
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.300
Could it be that you still want to compare with me?

22
00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:05.533
Okay, I'll compare it to you today.

23
00:01:05.533 --> 00:01:06.800
So what?

24
00:01:08.133 --> 00:01:08.933
Bingjiao

25
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.000
You saw it too

26
00:01:11.166 --> 00:01:14.600
This kid doesn't know how to lift and don't know how high the world is

27
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.500
If I can't help but beat him up later

28
00:01:17.566 --> 00:01:19.700
Don't blame me for being ruthless

29
00:01:21.066 --> 00:01:22.633
Police, can you understand anything?

30
00:01:22.666 --> 00:01:24.666
I'm going to transfer over in the morning to help you.

31
00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.900
Why are you talking to him like that?

32
00:01:28.866 --> 00:01:31.533
I just can't stand his self-righteousness

33
00:01:31.533 --> 00:01:33.700
Another lofty attitude

34
00:01:34.533 --> 00:01:35.466
Okay.

35
00:01:36.333 --> 00:01:37.566
Let me tell you something.

36
00:01:37.566 --> 00:01:40.433
If you talk to me like that again, I'll beat you up

37
00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.400
Who the hell is talking so big?

38
00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.000
Do you want to die?
