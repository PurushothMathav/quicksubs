00:00:00.466 --> 00:00:03.100
I tell you that the commander is a hero

2
00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:05.400
Impostor is a capital offense

3
00:00:05.466 --> 00:00:07.900
What, you said I was impersonating?

4
00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:09.666
Is it impersonation?

5
00:00:09.933 --> 00:00:12.366
Don't you have a point in your heart?

6
00:00:12.366 --> 00:00:13.166
Humph

7
00:00:13.666 --> 00:00:16.300
You're jealous that your woman likes me

8
00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:18.066
Just want to slander me

9
00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:20.300
It's you, a KTV waiter.

10
00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:21.600
How dare you tease Zhan Shuai

11
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:22.900
Do you not want to live?

12
00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:26.333
Religion? Believe me, he's just pretending. Enough.

13
00:00:26.333 --> 00:00:27.600
You've been a frog in the well

14
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.200
How can you know the majesty of the commander?

15
00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:30.466
Impostor dies

16
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:31.666
Who would dare to take revenge?

17
00:00:31.666 --> 00:00:33.300
Just kid

18
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.366
If you don't get out, don't blame me for bullying the small

19
00:00:37.366 --> 00:00:41.066
I will crush you to death, this ant.

20
00:00:41.066 --> 00:00:43.700
Sure. You are welcome

21
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.933
Come and crush me

22
00:00:45.933 --> 00:00:47.766
Since you want to die

23
00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.633
I'll let you kill him and send him to the crematorium

24
00:00:51.733 --> 00:00:54.633
Yes, what's wrong with him?

25
00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:57.100
Ming Jiao is just a KTV waiter

26
00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.566
Poor grassroots warrior

27
00:00:58.566 --> 00:00:59.833
You don't have to know him in general

28
00:01:00.133 --> 00:01:01.433
Give him a break.

29
00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:02.900
I want to spare him too

30
00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.600
But I don't blame him for wanting to die

31
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.366
But I don't want my family to die either.

32
00:01:07.366 --> 00:01:09.366
Lord Zhan Shuai, give me face

33
00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:10.633
I'll talk to him.

34
00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.800
Okay, for the sake of you being my sweetheart

35
00:01:16.966 --> 00:01:18.300
I'll give you face

36
00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:19.566
You hurry up and persuade him

37
00:01:19.566 --> 00:01:23.800
Otherwise he's a poor corpse

38
00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:24.900
Do you hear me?

39
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.000
Go away

40
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.200
Do you want your family to collect your body?
