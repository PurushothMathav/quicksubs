00:00:00.066 --> 00:00:01.366
Who dares to let him go

2
00:00:06.866 --> 00:00:08.866
You are so bold

3
00:00:08.933 --> 00:00:11.466
I hit my daughter and still dare to deliver it to my door

4
00:00:11.466 --> 00:00:13.700
He deserved it when I hit your daughter

5
00:00:13.766 --> 00:00:14.766
If I don't save him

6
00:00:14.766 --> 00:00:17.300
He had already been ruined by two men

7
00:00:17.466 --> 00:00:20.266
Then you mean I have to thank you.

8
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:22.600
I don't care if I'm grateful or not

9
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.766
Just don't take revenge

10
00:00:24.766 --> 00:00:26.333
Didn't I tell you?

11
00:00:26.333 --> 00:00:29.000
You are not worthy of my daughter, why are you still here?

12
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.566
It's up to you whether I deserve it or not

13
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.800
As long as Bing Jiao likes it

14
00:00:34.266 --> 00:00:35.700
He likes you.

15
00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:36.966
You want to be with him?

16
00:00:36.966 --> 00:00:38.700
If so, you go away together

17
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.700
My neighbor doesn't even have you as a daughter

18
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.666
Ping Jiao, trust me.

19
00:00:43.666 --> 00:00:47.800
Even if I don't have a neighbor, I can trust you enough

20
00:00:47.866 --> 00:00:49.600
You lie and brag without a bottom line

21
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.000
And you expect me to believe you?

22
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.433
You really think I'm stupid.

23
00:00:52.933 --> 00:00:54.066
I'm not lying.

24
00:00:54.266 --> 00:00:55.400
What I said is true.

25
00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:56.633
Don't say another word.

26
00:00:56.866 --> 00:00:59.600
Just pretend you don't know each other in the future and go by yourself

27
00:00:59.933 --> 00:01:02.266
Do you think you can just go?

28
00:01:02.266 --> 00:01:04.266
You hit my daughter

29
00:01:04.266 --> 00:01:06.600
I have to give an explanation today

30
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.700
Otherwise, I have to let the old man marry you all

31
00:01:11.133 --> 00:01:13.366
He must be expelled from the collar

32
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.166
You want to kick me out of my house?

33
00:01:15.166 --> 00:01:17.166
Are you trying to steal my position as president?

34
00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.533
A defeated arm called turning out

35
00:01:23.533 --> 00:01:25.400
What about the position of the CEO?
