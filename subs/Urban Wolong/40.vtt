00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.000
Who dares to touch him?

2
00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:05.766
Who are you?

3
00:00:05.766 --> 00:00:07.766
Someone who can protect him

4
00:00:07.766 --> 00:00:08.866
Why are you here?

5
00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:11.866
Since you have slept with me, you are my woman

6
00:00:11.866 --> 00:00:14.600
Of course I have to come if you have something to do

7
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:17.300
What are you, a lowly waiter, doing here?

8
00:00:17.366 --> 00:00:18.500
Help me cause trouble?

9
00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:20.966
Ah, you're the waiter?

10
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:21.933
So what?

11
00:00:21.933 --> 00:00:24.166
You have to die today

12
00:00:24.166 --> 00:00:26.800
It's already sunset in your neighborhood.

13
00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.833
Talk so boastfully

14
00:00:29.733 --> 00:00:31.200
How about the sunset?

15
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.100
Better than you, the waiter

16
00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.866
I advise you not to look down on people

17
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:38.633
What are you doing?

18
00:00:39.466 --> 00:00:40.833
I want to marry her

19
00:00:40.966 --> 00:00:43.500
What? You want to marry her?

20
00:00:43.533 --> 00:00:44.666
Did you split it?

21
00:00:44.666 --> 00:00:45.533
You a push-up

22
00:00:45.533 --> 00:00:47.166
How can I be worthy of my neighbor's daughter?

23
00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.033
It's just that I see you as a toad who wants to eat swan meat

24
00:00:51.066 --> 00:00:52.266
Dream on.

25
00:00:52.533 --> 00:00:54.266
As long as I like

26
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.566
He wants

27
00:00:56.666 --> 00:00:57.566
Dear

28
00:00:58.133 --> 00:00:59.066
Would you like to?

29
00:00:59.066 --> 00:01:00.933
You know the power of the Sun family

30
00:01:00.933 --> 00:01:02.166
Why do you want to die?

31
00:01:02.166 --> 00:01:03.466
Just go.

32
00:01:03.533 --> 00:01:06.266
I'll handle my own business, don't worry about me.

33
00:01:06.266 --> 00:01:09.600
I can help you deal with any trouble you encounter.
