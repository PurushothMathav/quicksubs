00:00:01.066 --> 00:00:03.233
Luo Delay, are things done?

2
00:00:03.866 --> 00:00:06.900
My lord, I will represent Longteng Group the day after tomorrow

3
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:08.100
Hold an invited tenders dinner

4
00:00:08.133 --> 00:00:10.833
Then I will announce your daughter Shi Ran Ran

5
00:00:10.866 --> 00:00:13.600
Become the only important aspect of this Empire State Building project

6
00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:14.733
As long as he gets this

7
00:00:14.733 --> 00:00:16.400
Contract for the 100 billion project

8
00:00:16.533 --> 00:00:18.600
He will become the new rule of the sea market

9
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.466
At that time, I will continue to escort him.

10
00:00:21.466 --> 00:00:24.533
Until he became a national sensation

11
00:00:24.533 --> 00:00:27.566
I had been worried that he was powerful and arrogant

12
00:00:27.566 --> 00:00:29.066
Can only support secretly

13
00:00:29.066 --> 00:00:30.600
Now that I'm going back

14
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.200
It's time to tell him who I really am

15
00:00:34.333 --> 00:00:37.566
I hope he doesn't blame me for hiding it for so many years

16
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.100
The Emperor Ran Ran is your daughter

17
00:00:40.133 --> 00:00:43.200
How can children in the world blame their parents?

18
00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:44.166
Yes!

19
00:00:44.166 --> 00:00:47.333
Master, if you hadn't been secretly assisting him

20
00:00:47.333 --> 00:00:49.066
He certainly won't be where he is now

21
00:00:49.066 --> 00:00:50.566
You gave birth to him and raised him

22
00:00:50.566 --> 00:00:52.833
Everything he has is given by you.

23
00:00:53.733 --> 00:00:54.700
You don't understand.

24
00:00:54.933 --> 00:00:56.166
Parents

25
00:00:56.166 --> 00:00:58.800
You only worry that you are not giving enough to your children.

26
00:00:59.533 --> 00:01:01.333
Vermilion Bird and Phoenix Hall

27
00:01:01.333 --> 00:01:04.333
Order the phoenix order of the heavy hall to be handed over to my daughter

28
00:01:04.333 --> 00:01:07.066
So that I can leave you in peace

29
00:01:07.966 --> 00:01:09.600
He's coming back tomorrow.

30
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.366
Then I will tell him my identity

31
00:01:26.166 --> 00:01:27.666
Hey, Aunt Yun

32
00:01:27.733 --> 00:01:30.433
You've been shopping since early in the morning

33
00:01:30.733 --> 00:01:33.400
So many dishes are enough for several of us to eat

34
00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.700
Don't do it, take a break

35
00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:37.666
Ran Ran has been busy with work

36
00:01:37.666 --> 00:01:39.433
I finally came back

37
00:01:39.666 --> 00:01:42.066
And there was this sweet and sour fish he liked in the kitchen.

38
00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:43.966
That's what I went to the vegetable market to buy early

39
00:01:43.966 --> 00:01:45.966
The freshly caught fish is fresh

40
00:01:46.133 --> 00:01:48.300
It'll be fine soon, I'll be there. Hmm.

41
00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.200
You're back!

42
00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.233
This is your friend, right?

43
00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.000
The food just came out of the pot

44
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.366
Eat while it's hot

45
00:02:03.466 --> 00:02:06.066
No need, I'll leave after packing up.

46
00:02:20.766 --> 00:02:21.633
Here it is.

47
00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:23.900
What does that mean?

48
00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.300
You don't understand this

49
00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:29.866
Ran Ran wants to break off the mother-daughter relationship with you?

50
00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:35.600
Are you okay?
