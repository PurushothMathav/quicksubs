00:00:03.066 --> 00:00:04.500
Why do you do it?

2
00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:08.366
Why because of you

3
00:00:09.066 --> 00:00:10.600
And you

4
00:00:11.133 --> 00:00:13.633
Make me lose everything that belonged to me

5
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.133
Brother, stop it

6
00:00:16.133 --> 00:00:17.000
You want this back to me?

7
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.466
I'll give it to you.

8
00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:22.000
Brother hahahaha

9
00:00:22.466 --> 00:00:24.666
What a long-lost title

10
00:00:24.966 --> 00:00:28.233
Married family, don't be hypocritical anywhere

11
00:00:28.466 --> 00:00:30.433
What did you give me?

12
00:00:30.933 --> 00:00:32.700
It belongs to me

13
00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:36.066
No matter how nice you say it, I know

14
00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:39.766
This is your excuse

15
00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:44.300
Cheng Jiarou, you keep saying that it is for my own good

16
00:00:44.366 --> 00:00:46.100
Did you ask me?

17
00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.566
Did you give me what I wanted?

18
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.166
Freedom, glory and wealth

19
00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.766
This is what you want.

20
00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:56.833
Not what I want

21
00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.566
It was my throne

22
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.400
Helping you behind your back

23
00:01:06.533 --> 00:01:08.400
Smooth the obstacles for you

24
00:01:08.533 --> 00:01:10.100
Make suggestions for you

25
00:01:10.566 --> 00:01:12.366
Received the favor of the father

26
00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.166
And you are not cheap with Liu

27
00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:16.366
Why?

28
00:01:17.533 --> 00:01:18.300
Cheng Shuyu

29
00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.300
Can you stop being so opinionated?

30
00:01:20.533 --> 00:01:21.133
You deserve it.

31
00:01:21.133 --> 00:01:22.600
I've already told you

32
00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.966
Why don't you believe it? Believe it.

33
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.800
Did he ever believe me?

34
00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.200
Shi Yun told him that I have the ability to make him reuse it.

35
00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.366
And he refused.

36
00:01:35.366 --> 00:01:36.366
Why is that?

37
00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.066
Because he was afraid I would threaten his throne

38
00:01:40.166 --> 00:01:43.433
No brother, it's not like this.

39
00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.500
All liars

40
00:01:45.733 --> 00:01:47.033
All liars

41
00:01:47.266 --> 00:01:49.500
I will make you pay back a hundredfold

42
00:01:51.133 --> 00:01:51.933
brother
