00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.466
Before you die

2
00:00:10.966 --> 00:00:12.566
Tell me again and again

3
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.200
We must take good care of our daughter

4
00:00:16.366 --> 00:00:17.433
But now

5
00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.600
What you get is your daughter's thoughts

6
00:00:21.366 --> 00:00:23.000
I feel sorry for you.

7
00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:25.766
After all, we were wrong about him.

8
00:00:25.766 --> 00:00:27.700
The emperor of Xuan Kingdom changed

9
00:00:27.766 --> 00:00:29.066
I'm eyeing

10
00:00:29.366 --> 00:00:30.900
The empress is weak

11
00:00:30.933 --> 00:00:33.300
The daughter of the emperor has not yet been seen

12
00:00:33.333 --> 00:00:35.233
I went to war with my husband

13
00:00:35.466 --> 00:00:36.766
Although the war is victorious

14
00:00:36.766 --> 00:00:39.166
But the experimental general stayed forever

15
00:00:39.166 --> 00:00:40.566
In that war

16
00:00:40.766 --> 00:00:42.433
The emperor removed his armor and returned to the field

17
00:00:42.966 --> 00:00:45.266
Unfortunately, my daughter was kidnapped

18
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:48.066
The emperor found his daughter with warm jade

19
00:00:48.066 --> 00:00:50.633
But now it's fate

20
00:00:51.566 --> 00:00:54.233
Fortunately, the emperor still has you as an adopted daughter

21
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.066
Not always let down

22
00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:00.666
Xiaoyun

23
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.633
Is that you?

24
00:01:04.966 --> 00:01:08.266
I'm Liu Ru, the midwife when you gave birth to your daughter.

25
00:01:08.266 --> 00:01:09.800
Do you still remember me?

26
00:01:13.066 --> 00:01:14.566
I remember now.

27
00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:16.400
I was tough back then

28
00:01:16.533 --> 00:01:18.666
Thanks to you

29
00:01:18.666 --> 00:01:20.933
That's all for you and your daughter.

30
00:01:20.933 --> 00:01:24.500
When you gave birth to your daughter, you collapsed and passed out

31
00:01:24.533 --> 00:01:27.000
Don't you know how expensive your daughter is?

32
00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.800
Big nose eyes

33
00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.066
I have picked up so many children

34
00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.800
It's the first time I've seen it.

35
00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.300
You were born like a porcelain doll

36
00:01:38.133 --> 00:01:41.266
I think, when this daughter grows up

37
00:01:41.266 --> 00:01:43.466
Must have the beauty of a country

38
00:01:43.933 --> 00:01:47.366
And he has a butterfly birthmark behind his ear

39
00:01:49.566 --> 00:01:53.366
My daughter has been dead for a long time

40
00:01:56.666 --> 00:01:57.533
I remember now.

41
00:01:57.533 --> 00:01:59.433
I have something to do at home

42
00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:00.966
I'm going back.

43
00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:08.400
moral

44
00:02:08.966 --> 00:02:11.766
It's okay, I'm your daughter too.

45
00:02:11.766 --> 00:02:14.366
In the future, I can give you a pension

46
00:02:14.466 --> 00:02:16.466
You still have me
