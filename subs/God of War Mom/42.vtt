00:00:06.366 --> 00:00:07.700
The patient is making a great recovery.

2
00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:09.400
It'll be fine for a while.

3
00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:11.466
Thank you doctor

4
00:00:18.266 --> 00:00:19.433
Sorry.

5
00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.033
I hurt you.

6
00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.900
In fact, I learned that you were missing

7
00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:28.666
I've been looking for you all over the world.

8
00:00:29.466 --> 00:00:30.500
But

9
00:00:33.566 --> 00:00:34.433
Sorry.

10
00:00:35.733 --> 00:00:36.533
Sorry.

11
00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.866
But you had already found Ran Ran

12
00:00:42.966 --> 00:00:45.266
Why did you bring me back?

13
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:46.766
Because at that time

14
00:00:46.766 --> 00:00:49.600
I saw you fainting on the ground like Ran Ran

15
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.433
I don't know why.

16
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.033
My heart hurts

17
00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:57.366
My gut tells me I can't leave you alone

18
00:00:58.933 --> 00:01:00.966
So I took you home

19
00:01:02.766 --> 00:01:05.700
Remember when I named you?

20
00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:07.500
case

21
00:01:09.133 --> 00:01:10.766
pray for peace

22
00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.366
I really hope for the rest of your life

23
00:01:13.366 --> 00:01:15.066
Can be safe

24
00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:17.600
But you

25
00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:21.466
Aren't you afraid of making the same mistake again?

26
00:01:21.666 --> 00:01:22.666
Will not

27
00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.600
You have the unique mark I left you

28
00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:28.433
actually

29
00:01:29.333 --> 00:01:32.100
When I confirmed that you were my daughter

30
00:01:33.466 --> 00:01:35.100
I was terrified.

31
00:01:35.666 --> 00:01:37.500
I'm afraid you won't recognize me

32
00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.566
Because I know in my heart

33
00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:42.900
How much hardship have you suffered over the years?

34
00:01:46.933 --> 00:01:47.966
Sorry.

35
00:01:50.366 --> 00:01:53.633
Mom will compensate you slowly in the future.

36
00:01:55.666 --> 00:01:57.766
You have been by my side for so many years

37
00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:59.966
I didn't recognize you.

38
00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.766
You have suffered so much grievance

39
00:02:04.266 --> 00:02:07.033
Even if you don't recognize me, I deserve it

40
00:02:07.333 --> 00:02:09.366
I don't deserve to be your mother

41
00:02:14.166 --> 00:02:15.500
But then I thought

42
00:02:15.733 --> 00:02:17.600
We still have a long time.

43
00:02:18.533 --> 00:02:21.500
I can compensate you slowly with the rest of my life

44
00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.666
I don't ask you to forgive me right now

45
00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.566
As long as you can be by my side

46
00:02:28.166 --> 00:02:29.166
Miss Shi

47
00:02:29.366 --> 00:02:32.366
When Madam Shi gave birth to you, you received the task

48
00:02:32.366 --> 00:02:33.300
For the country

49
00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.700
I entrusted you to someone else as a last resort

50
00:02:36.166 --> 00:02:38.433
Follow the group of stone guns to kill the enemy

51
00:02:38.733 --> 00:02:41.266
This is not what Madam Shi wanted to happen

52
00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.700
In these days of learning the truth

53
00:02:43.866 --> 00:02:45.433
Madam Shi's dormitory is uneasy

54
00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.166
He is thinking of you all the time.

55
00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.466
Madam Shi really loves you

56
00:02:50.666 --> 00:02:53.633
The original choice was just forced

57
00:02:53.766 --> 00:02:55.300
I can't help it.

58
00:02:57.166 --> 00:02:58.000
OK

59
00:02:58.533 --> 00:03:01.033
Then you have to promise me

60
00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.966
You can't leave me behind again

61
00:03:03.966 --> 00:03:07.600
No, it won't.

62
00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.000
Never again.

63
00:03:32.166 --> 00:03:32.966
Zhang Huang

64
00:03:33.533 --> 00:03:35.000
This time Miss Shi was tied up

65
00:03:35.066 --> 00:03:36.566
Shi Ran is also the mastermind

66
00:03:38.166 --> 00:03:38.966
Never mind.

67
00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.433
Let the laws of the country educate him

68
00:03:41.666 --> 00:03:44.300
I hope he can reflect on it in prison

69
00:03:44.666 --> 00:03:45.766
reform

70
00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:47.000
Okay

71
00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:51.233
I'm going to buy An An's birthday present in a while

72
00:03:51.766 --> 00:03:54.333
I left all the birthday gifts from previous years at home

73
00:03:54.333 --> 00:03:56.500
Please help me decorate my house well

74
00:03:56.666 --> 00:04:00.033
I want to celebrate Ann's birthday
