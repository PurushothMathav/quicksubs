00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.900
I didn't want to say it

2
00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:02.933
You have to ask

3
00:00:02.933 --> 00:00:04.700
Then take the money and sign it quickly

4
00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:05.533
I did the math.

5
00:00:05.533 --> 00:00:08.300
That's how much I spent growing up.

6
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.200
So in your heart

7
00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:12.700
My love for you

8
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.700
Blood is thicker than water

9
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.000
Is it all measured in money?

10
00:00:17.066 --> 00:00:20.300
Then don't you just think there is less money? It doesn't matter.

11
00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:21.633
I still have

12
00:00:23.533 --> 00:00:24.400
Enough is enough.

13
00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.333
Shen Anran, you said it all

14
00:00:27.333 --> 00:00:29.033
Won't your heart hurt?

15
00:00:29.133 --> 00:00:31.600
You had a high fever when you were 10

16
00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.000
It was Aunt Yun who didn't sleep all night

17
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
I've been wiping your sweat and changing towels for you.

18
00:00:35.333 --> 00:00:38.200
Then you said you were going to study abroad

19
00:00:38.766 --> 00:00:40.866
It means he delivers takeout during the day

20
00:00:40.866 --> 00:00:42.333
And we have barbecues at night.

21
00:00:42.333 --> 00:00:45.033
Just to give you a penny for saving tuition

22
00:00:45.366 --> 00:00:47.500
How do you calculate these accounts?

23
00:00:49.366 --> 00:00:53.266
And these, these are all your favorites

24
00:00:53.733 --> 00:00:55.333
In case he knows you're coming back

25
00:00:55.333 --> 00:00:56.600
He has been busy since early morning

26
00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.300
Didn't rest for a moment

27
00:00:59.066 --> 00:01:00.300
His love for you

28
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.266
How do you count from childhood to adulthood?

29
00:01:02.266 --> 00:01:03.366
So what?

30
00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:06.033
These are for me

31
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.433
worthless

32
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.266
worthless

33
00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:14.466
What is valuable in your eyes?

34
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.033
Money power

35
00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:18.633
Or status

36
00:01:19.366 --> 00:01:21.300
These things are in my eyes

37
00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.000
Is worthless

38
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.000
So?

39
00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:26.100
We are not from the same world at all

40
00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.733
What I want is someone who is worthy of my identity

41
00:01:28.733 --> 00:01:31.033
The mother who stands with me at the top of the pyramid

42
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.066
Rather than a person who only knows firewood, rice, oil and salt

43
00:01:35.133 --> 00:01:36.833
Self-deprecating waste

44
00:01:37.966 --> 00:01:39.900
Look at what color you are wearing.

45
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.333
Walk out with me.

46
00:01:41.333 --> 00:01:43.366
I know. I thought you were my mother

47
00:01:43.366 --> 00:01:44.566
I don't know.

48
00:01:44.566 --> 00:01:46.000
Only when you are my queen

49
00:01:48.133 --> 00:01:48.933
maid

50
00:01:49.733 --> 00:01:51.166
Call me a maid

51
00:01:51.966 --> 00:01:54.600
Shi Ran Ran, you don't think

52
00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:55.566
Without me

53
00:01:55.566 --> 00:01:56.400
Just by yourself

54
00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.866
Can you really achieve what you are now?

55
00:01:58.866 --> 00:02:00.433
Without me

56
00:02:01.866 --> 00:02:03.800
Can you have the status you have today?

57
00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:05.300
Without me

58
00:02:05.333 --> 00:02:07.633
Can you win the contract?

59
00:02:08.333 --> 00:02:09.900
Without me

60
00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.366
It's nothing.

61
00:02:15.666 --> 00:02:18.000
You just gave birth to Ran Ran

62
00:02:18.466 --> 00:02:20.266
Don't sell melons here

63
00:02:20.566 --> 00:02:23.000
Sell yourself

64
00:02:25.066 --> 00:02:28.400
You're just a guy who can only sell barbecue

65
00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:29.933
For that little fly

66
00:02:29.933 --> 00:02:32.100
People who have to argue about small profits

67
00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.033
You will never understand

68
00:02:34.066 --> 00:02:36.200
Noble in society

69
00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.766
Well said, as expected of the daughter I recognize

70
00:02:44.566 --> 00:02:48.300
Mom, why are you here?

71
00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.900
How can our vision compare to yours?
