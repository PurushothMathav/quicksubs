00:00:16.766 --> 00:00:18.066
Hahaha

2
00:00:18.066 --> 00:00:21.466
Empress Zhu Xu gave three orders for you to return to the imperial capital

3
00:00:21.566 --> 00:00:23.466
How did you come to Haishi by detour?

4
00:00:23.466 --> 00:00:24.000
I got it.

5
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.666
Naturally, it is more important to meet a girlfriend

6
00:00:26.666 --> 00:00:27.466
Oh.

7
00:00:31.566 --> 00:00:34.866
Phoenix Ye Pai Jintiandi is only a drinking ticket for one person

8
00:00:34.866 --> 00:00:36.633
This is the adult's accessory.

9
00:00:36.933 --> 00:00:39.466
It seems that you came for him

10
00:00:39.466 --> 00:00:42.066
Who else has contributed to the Queen besides that one?

11
00:00:42.333 --> 00:00:44.566
I need to see him right away please

12
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.400
You see that girl is so good looking, it's really good

13
00:01:01.133 --> 00:01:03.066
Baby, the order is coming.

14
00:01:04.666 --> 00:01:08.500
I wiped a fraction, a total of 30 boys, beautiful woman

15
00:01:08.666 --> 00:01:12.200
Have a glass of wine and get to know each other. Who are you? What are you doing?

16
00:01:13.333 --> 00:01:15.266
You are so shameless, right?

17
00:01:18.933 --> 00:01:19.966
Ah!

18
00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.233
Don't you dress so slutty just to seduce me?

19
00:01:31.266 --> 00:01:33.633
I can see you, that's your blessing

20
00:01:46.166 --> 00:01:48.133
Little brother, this is mine.

21
00:01:48.133 --> 00:01:49.200
Give me face

22
00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:51.300
I'll have this one tonight.

23
00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:52.366
How old are you?

24
00:01:52.466 --> 00:01:54.233
Get out of here

25
00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.966
You dare my boss is the brother-in-law of Dragon Barrel Cave

26
00:02:37.966 --> 00:02:40.100
If you dare to move, I will kill you

27
00:02:40.466 --> 00:02:42.966
Governor Long, Governor Southwest

28
00:02:43.133 --> 00:02:44.366
Longyan Pool?

29
00:02:44.366 --> 00:02:45.533
How could you know?

30
00:02:45.533 --> 00:02:47.300
He is the top black ghost of sea lions

31
00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:49.366
If you're afraid, set fire to it

32
00:02:49.933 --> 00:02:51.000
And this kind of woman

33
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.200
They don't sleep in the middle of the night, they come out for barbecues.

34
00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.900
Obviously out to fish for Kaizi

35
00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.333
I came to satisfy them just by concurrence

36
00:02:57.333 --> 00:02:58.566
And you're still meddling?

37
00:02:58.566 --> 00:03:00.566
I suggest you let me go

38
00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:01.866
No, it's not.

39
00:03:01.866 --> 00:03:03.266
We don't have it.

40
00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.500
No matter how big yours is

41
00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.400
It's a pity that my guts are not blind

42
00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:09.333
What do you want?

43
00:03:09.333 --> 00:03:11.733
When they come, you're all going to die

44
00:03:11.733 --> 00:03:12.533
Stop

45
00:03:13.133 --> 00:03:14.600
Let him go
