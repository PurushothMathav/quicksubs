00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.000
Stop

2
00:00:08.466 --> 00:00:09.966
Brother Jiang Qisheng

3
00:00:09.966 --> 00:00:12.166
Did you eat the bear leopard bomb?

4
00:00:12.166 --> 00:00:13.600
This is the trouble every day

5
00:00:15.733 --> 00:00:17.066
Now dodge the longan

6
00:00:17.333 --> 00:00:18.133
Just answer

7
00:00:18.733 --> 00:00:21.100
Brother, isn't he just a barbecue seller?

8
00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:22.266
Shut your stinky mouth

9
00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.066
Long Yanshi, this is your subordinate.

10
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:26.900
Warrior ability

11
00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:28.500
Is used to defend the country

12
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.033
Defend the people

13
00:00:30.066 --> 00:00:32.333
It's not for him to be strong and weak here

14
00:00:32.333 --> 00:00:34.900
Not to mention molesting women

15
00:00:35.566 --> 00:00:37.300
I see you Governor of Southwest

16
00:00:37.933 --> 00:00:39.266
Don't do it yes

17
00:00:39.733 --> 00:00:41.000
It's a subordinate's fault

18
00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:46.066
Take it away from me

19
00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.700
Brother, brother

20
00:00:50.366 --> 00:00:53.666
Girl, come on, go home

21
00:00:53.766 --> 00:00:55.166
Thanks go ahead

22
00:01:00.566 --> 00:01:03.466
Why did the little vermilion bird come to me?

23
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:13.800
old man

24
00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:16.233
Long time no see.

25
00:01:17.666 --> 00:01:20.366
Phoenix Store respectfully invites the Emperor to return

26
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.766
I respectfully invite the Emperor to return

27
00:01:21.766 --> 00:01:23.633
I respectfully invite the Emperor to return

28
00:01:26.133 --> 00:01:27.300
Get up.

29
00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.566
The emperor is now in turmoil on the frontier

30
00:01:31.566 --> 00:01:32.733
Resist tiger gall

31
00:01:32.733 --> 00:01:34.066
The queen summoned us back

32
00:01:34.066 --> 00:01:35.633
It's been done three times.

33
00:01:35.966 --> 00:01:38.266
I implore the Emperor to return to preside over the overall situation

34
00:01:38.266 --> 00:01:41.033
Ask the emperor to return to preside over the overall situation

35
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.500
Standing up as a nation

36
00:01:43.666 --> 00:01:44.900
Country in trouble

37
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.400
Come back when called

38
00:01:47.333 --> 00:01:48.233
But

39
00:01:49.366 --> 00:01:50.866
Before the return

40
00:01:52.066 --> 00:01:53.966
There's one more person who can't let go
