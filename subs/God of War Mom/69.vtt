00:00:10.966 --> 00:00:12.000
today

2
00:00:12.066 --> 00:00:14.900
Who was the man we saw in prison?

3
00:00:14.966 --> 00:00:16.433
Feels a little familiar

4
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.366
Familiar of course familiar

5
00:00:19.133 --> 00:00:21.233
He just wants to kill you

6
00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.833
But he doesn't look like a bad guy.

7
00:00:26.966 --> 00:00:29.233
Solid, people can't look good

8
00:00:29.366 --> 00:00:31.400
It's because of the poetry that gets in the way

9
00:00:31.733 --> 00:00:34.366
That's why our father and daughter have been separated for many years

10
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.933
He also sold you to a fraud syndicate

11
00:00:37.933 --> 00:00:39.400
Made you suffer

12
00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:40.866
Did you forget all this?

13
00:00:40.866 --> 00:00:42.466
He is your enemy.

14
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.766
Do you remember?

15
00:00:57.533 --> 00:00:58.900
I am your father

16
00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:00.366
I won't lie to you.

17
00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:03.500
Father, I believe in you

18
00:01:04.333 --> 00:01:07.566
17 2 That woman stole everything from me

19
00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:11.766
And almost made it impossible for us women to go on blind dates forever

20
00:01:12.666 --> 00:01:14.366
He is the person you hate the most

21
00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:18.233
Look at this.

22
00:01:18.266 --> 00:01:20.200
This is what he left behind when he hit you

23
00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.666
He destroyed our family before

24
00:01:32.533 --> 00:01:33.333
It's You

25
00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:35.966
Is your eternal enemy

26
00:01:36.266 --> 00:01:39.233
You must remember to kill him

27
00:01:45.166 --> 00:01:47.700
As long as you dare to do anything in October

28
00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.766
I will let you die at the hands of your own daughter
