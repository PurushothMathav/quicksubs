00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:03.533
Pardon me?

2
00:00:03.533 --> 00:00:04.833
And I said, "Okay.

3
00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:09.800
I'm not your blood

4
00:00:19.066 --> 00:00:19.866
That's impossible.

5
00:00:20.533 --> 00:00:23.500
Impossible when I found you

6
00:00:23.566 --> 00:00:25.066
This warm jade is in your hand.

7
00:00:25.066 --> 00:00:27.433
This warm jade is not mine at all

8
00:00:28.666 --> 00:00:29.000
Me.

9
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.700
From a starved child?

10
00:00:31.766 --> 00:00:33.800
If it weren't for finding someone to adopt

11
00:00:34.133 --> 00:00:36.100
You thought I would talk to you

12
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.966
All of this

13
00:00:37.966 --> 00:00:40.433
But you're just stupid.

14
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.266
If I had known you were as incompetent as you are today

15
00:00:43.466 --> 00:00:45.033
I'm blind to tell you

16
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.300
You've been lying to me since the beginning

17
00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:53.400
Now you still dislike me

18
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.166
I dislike you what's wrong

19
00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:56.700
People go high

20
00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:57.866
The water goes down.

21
00:00:58.166 --> 00:01:00.800
You only know how to set up a stall selling barbecue every day

22
00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.400
Dealing with the smell of oil fumes

23
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:03.800
I'm not interested.

24
00:01:06.533 --> 00:01:07.433
now

25
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.100
I have this phoenix power

26
00:01:10.133 --> 00:01:12.233
It will soon become the entire sea market

27
00:01:12.666 --> 00:01:16.233
I am the leader of the whole country

28
00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:21.100
Do you think you deserve to be mine?

29
00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.466
Shi Yun would have been if you had self-knowledge

30
00:01:27.466 --> 00:01:28.666
Recognize reality

31
00:01:28.666 --> 00:01:31.366
But just do more entanglement

32
00:01:31.366 --> 00:01:34.100
I didn't expect you to pretend to be His Royal Highness the Warlord

33
00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:35.500
seek death

34
00:01:35.933 --> 00:01:37.766
Can't blame us

35
00:01:38.866 --> 00:01:41.166
Master told him

36
00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:44.033
Pretending to be the emperor
