00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:04.766
Ah!

2
00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:08.700
Who do you say is your father?

3
00:00:10.466 --> 00:00:11.500
He's not your father

4
00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:12.700
He is lying to you.

5
00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:14.566
You have no right to say him

6
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:17.600
rhyme

7
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.666
You fooled them by saying these high-sounding things

8
00:00:21.666 --> 00:00:22.866
Can't fool me

9
00:00:22.866 --> 00:00:25.000
When you sold me to a fraudster

10
00:00:25.133 --> 00:00:27.166
I almost died

11
00:00:27.266 --> 00:00:30.266
And now you're going to kill my father?

12
00:00:30.766 --> 00:00:32.766
Then I will never allow it.

13
00:00:32.933 --> 00:00:35.766
It's really a good show of deception and cannibalism

14
00:00:36.166 --> 00:00:37.966
These are the words he told you

15
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.266
It's all fake.

16
00:00:40.266 --> 00:00:41.000
He is lying to you.

17
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.300
Don't listen to him

18
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:43.900
My good daughter

19
00:00:44.733 --> 00:00:45.900
That's him!

20
00:00:46.666 --> 00:00:48.366
We were separated as children

21
00:00:48.466 --> 00:00:50.600
I almost never saw you again

22
00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:52.466
Here's your chance.

23
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.066
I killed him.

24
00:01:01.933 --> 00:01:03.000
I'm Sister Yun.

25
00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:05.633
I am your mother

26
00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.066
Don't you remember me?

27
00:01:19.966 --> 00:01:23.500
What's the matter? Do you want to remember it in vain?

28
00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.066
Get up and don't talk nonsense to him

29
00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.633
He almost killed you

30
00:01:27.733 --> 00:01:29.866
Give him a chance

31
00:01:31.366 --> 00:01:33.200
Kill him for me kill him
