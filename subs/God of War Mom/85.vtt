00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.300
Get out get out

2
00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:05.433
Oops, just made trouble in my store

3
00:00:05.866 --> 00:00:09.300
The store manager hit me, you see it's all red

4
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:10.866
Are you the one who dared to hit me?

5
00:00:10.866 --> 00:00:12.900
Your clerk looks down on people

6
00:00:13.466 --> 00:00:15.066
I've never seen such a business before

7
00:00:15.066 --> 00:00:16.333
Then what are you doing here?

8
00:00:16.333 --> 00:00:18.266
What else can I do in a clothing store?

9
00:00:18.333 --> 00:00:20.666
Mainly, what we buy in our store are high-end goods.

10
00:00:20.733 --> 00:00:22.500
Some customers just don't buy it.

11
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.166
And got my clothes dirty

12
00:00:24.166 --> 00:00:25.666
Who said I don't buy it?

13
00:00:25.766 --> 00:00:26.900
Just you.

14
00:00:27.666 --> 00:00:29.133
A poor sour taste

15
00:00:29.133 --> 00:00:31.266
Can you afford it?

16
00:00:31.366 --> 00:00:32.333
Don't say that.

17
00:00:32.333 --> 00:00:34.233
What if he can afford it?

18
00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:35.800
Does the customer have a God?

19
00:00:35.866 --> 00:00:37.600
Madam, please pad it.

20
00:00:40.666 --> 00:00:42.300
Madam, let me remind you again.

21
00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.033
Our store buys high-end goods.

22
00:00:44.066 --> 00:00:45.500
If you just watch it and don't buy it

23
00:00:45.733 --> 00:00:47.100
If it gets dirty or damaged

24
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.766
But you have to compensate according to the price.

25
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.433
Your clerk told me just now.

26
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:52.600
You don't have to repeat

27
00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.433
Then please be patient.

28
00:00:55.333 --> 00:00:58.533
Hey, I said when you choose clothes

29
00:00:58.533 --> 00:01:00.233
Also take a look at the tag

30
00:01:00.366 --> 00:01:03.466
So as not to waste everyone's time, that's it

31
00:01:05.333 --> 00:01:06.133
OK

32
00:01:09.266 --> 00:01:11.900
35,000 in total, or cash?

33
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:23.800
Yo

34
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.766
No money?
