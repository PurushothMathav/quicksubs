00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:11.466
When Miss Ran Ran Xu was

2
00:00:18.466 --> 00:00:19.400
About the head

3
00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:21.366
Don't give up

4
00:00:26.766 --> 00:00:28.100
I'm 12.

5
00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:32.866
Miss Shi is below the Phoenix Hall

6
00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:34.866
He beat Vermilion Bird to his direct disciple

7
00:00:34.866 --> 00:00:37.200
Grant the order of His Royal Highness the Warlord

8
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.766
Put the Phoenix Order in your hands

9
00:00:42.466 --> 00:00:44.666
Ran Ran, hurry up and accept it

10
00:00:44.666 --> 00:00:46.900
This must have been specially prepared by the Warlord for you

11
00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:49.433
The Warlord is very important

12
00:00:55.133 --> 00:00:59.100
Phoenix Store This is the treasure of Phoenix Store

13
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.200
Can represent His Royal Highness the Warlord

14
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.800
The Phoenix store has received this identity license.

15
00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.300
Give 13

16
00:01:05.333 --> 00:01:08.600
Is what the police lady said true?

17
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:09.700
Definitely?

18
00:01:10.666 --> 00:01:14.300
It seems that His Highness the comrade-in-arms is really imposing

19
00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:15.933
Liberation or not

20
00:01:15.933 --> 00:01:17.933
How could you put such a valuable thing?

21
00:01:17.933 --> 00:01:19.433
Give it to the goddaughter

22
00:01:20.166 --> 00:01:23.200
Haiswear is going to change after all

23
00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.033
Ran Ran, you really found a good mother

24
00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.433
This Lord Huang

25
00:01:27.466 --> 00:01:29.400
It must be for Mrs. Jing's sake

26
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.300
I will give you this treasure as a gift.

27
00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:33.466
How much do you want to thank Mrs. Jing?

28
00:01:40.733 --> 00:01:42.733
Why must I respect you well in the future?

29
00:01:42.733 --> 00:01:44.566
This is what a godmother should do.

30
00:01:45.733 --> 00:01:47.733
Lord Yin, you came just in time

31
00:01:47.733 --> 00:01:49.900
There's a guy who has a barbecue stall.

32
00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:51.000
make nonsense

33
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.833
Impersonate the Emperor and insult the Phoenix Store

34
00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:55.366
And this

35
00:01:55.366 --> 00:01:58.066
Lord Chi Yin, everything I say is true

36
00:01:58.066 --> 00:01:59.966
Everyone here can testify

37
00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.166
That's right for Lord Chi Yin

38
00:02:02.666 --> 00:02:06.233
That person has never put the Phoenix Hall in his eyes

39
00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:09.266
How dare someone pretend to be His Royal Highness the War Emperor?

40
00:02:09.666 --> 00:02:12.600
I'd like to see who's not talking here
