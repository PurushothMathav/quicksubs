00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:03.300
Ah, right?

2
00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:05.100
It's okay, I'm okay.

3
00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.533
Although you think too highly of yourself

4
00:00:07.533 --> 00:00:09.466
I signed the contract for you

5
00:00:09.466 --> 00:00:10.433
Your little money

6
00:00:10.666 --> 00:00:11.800
Countless of my wine

7
00:00:11.966 --> 00:00:13.766
What a big breath

8
00:00:13.766 --> 00:00:14.600
Sign a contract

9
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:17.000
It was obviously given to Ran Ran by my brother Longyanchi

10
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.466
Just a barbecue seller

11
00:00:18.466 --> 00:00:21.066
Sorry to tell this big lie here

12
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.800
Lie, then you can ask Longyanchi

13
00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.866
If I don't agree to the 100 billion contract rush

14
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.733
As fate would have it, for the sake of your birth mother

15
00:00:33.733 --> 00:00:35.333
I can tolerate it again and again

16
00:00:35.333 --> 00:00:38.100
But that doesn't mean you can be rude

17
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.866
Provoke my big brother to disrespect our farm family

18
00:00:40.866 --> 00:00:44.300
I now demand that you kneel down and apologize to us immediately

19
00:00:45.066 --> 00:00:47.866
It turned out to be a short-sighted vendor selling barbecues

20
00:00:47.866 --> 00:00:49.300
I don't know the sky is high and the earth is thick

21
00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.433
Poor Miss Shi, talking about such a life is really

22
00:00:53.666 --> 00:00:56.000
Shiyun, I have cut ties with you

23
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.933
If you are willing to kneel down to my godmother today and admit your mistake

24
00:00:58.933 --> 00:01:01.333
Maybe I'll intercede for you.

25
00:01:01.333 --> 00:01:03.866
This Governor Long looks at the face of his godmother

26
00:01:03.866 --> 00:01:05.200
I can also spare your life

27
00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.566
It's you who made me kneel for him

28
00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:09.800
He also deserves

29
00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:14.766
Mrs. Jing's first-term tour is not eligible

30
00:01:14.766 --> 00:01:17.466
Then add me, the president of the Sea Chamber of Commerce

31
00:01:17.466 --> 00:01:18.966
Is the constitution enough?

32
00:01:18.966 --> 00:01:20.800
Isn't it enough?

33
00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.900
What about Wang Peng, the lord of Haicheng City?

34
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.733
And I, the godfather of the Luo Sha Gang, Li Minghai

35
00:01:27.733 --> 00:01:30.500
Is this qualified enough?

36
00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.466
Far from enough

37
00:01:38.333 --> 00:01:39.166
I see.

38
00:01:39.166 --> 00:01:42.900
Everyone here wants to see me being bullied

39
00:01:43.133 --> 00:01:46.066
Too bad you don't deserve it
