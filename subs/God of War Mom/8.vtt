00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:03.433
Ha, you really have backbone.

2
00:00:03.566 --> 00:00:04.266
This money

3
00:00:04.266 --> 00:00:06.466
You can't make money selling barbecues for a lifetime

4
00:00:06.466 --> 00:00:10.033
I'll give it to you now, don't regret it.

5
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.666
Come back to entangle then

6
00:00:11.666 --> 00:00:13.300
I still don't like this money

7
00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:14.933
If I want to spend money

8
00:00:14.933 --> 00:00:16.166
Longteng's funds

9
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.200
Transfer with me hahaha

10
00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.000
Move as you like

11
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.566
Why don't you say that my brother also listens to your instructions?

12
00:00:23.566 --> 00:00:26.400
Of course if I let him go east

13
00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.366
He dared not go west

14
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.200
Oops before you said that

15
00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.400
Did you look in your mirror?

16
00:00:34.466 --> 00:00:36.066
What kind of stuff?

17
00:00:36.333 --> 00:00:38.533
My brother's taste is not so bad

18
00:00:38.533 --> 00:00:40.266
To tell you the truth

19
00:00:40.366 --> 00:00:42.833
Ran Ran can win this and sign a contract

20
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:46.033
I've been saying it twice next to my brother

21
00:00:46.566 --> 00:00:48.266
What is it?

22
00:00:49.133 --> 00:00:50.200
Return to you

23
00:00:50.733 --> 00:00:52.266
Why treat me with respect?

24
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.200
Oh, dear.

25
00:00:57.766 --> 00:01:00.300
Poet, you even follow your own mother

26
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.566
Don't care about getting married?

27
00:01:01.566 --> 00:01:02.766
So what?

28
00:01:02.766 --> 00:01:04.633
He said it himself

29
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:08.666
OK

30
00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.433
That's so great!

31
00:01:11.733 --> 00:01:13.166
The letters have been cut

32
00:01:13.866 --> 00:01:15.100
Get out of my house

33
00:01:16.733 --> 00:01:18.100
Why are we going?

34
00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.266
I don't want this either.

35
00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:24.300
And so forth.

36
00:01:29.266 --> 00:01:30.633
The warm moon your dad left for you

37
00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.200
Give it back to me you don't deserve it
