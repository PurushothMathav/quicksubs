00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.366
Is Mimi okay? Mimi

2
00:00:01.966 --> 00:00:02.766
slowly

3
00:00:03.133 --> 00:00:04.766
Yiyi is your biological mother

4
00:00:04.766 --> 00:00:06.600
How can you cut ties with him?

5
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:07.800
So what?

6
00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.166
If I were Ran Ran

7
00:00:09.166 --> 00:00:11.166
I also want to cut off the mother-daughter relationship with him

8
00:00:11.166 --> 00:00:14.333
Just a lowly guy selling barbecue

9
00:00:14.333 --> 00:00:16.366
She is also worthy of being our mother

10
00:00:17.133 --> 00:00:18.766
What's wrong with selling barbecue?

11
00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.100
Selling barbecues is also hard work to make money

12
00:00:22.966 --> 00:00:25.000
Why am I not worthy to be his mother?

13
00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:27.366
Just your money

14
00:00:27.366 --> 00:00:29.166
I'm afraid it's not even enough to plug between my teeth

15
00:00:29.166 --> 00:00:31.666
We started this on our own.

16
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.966
The business genius who took the company public in three years

17
00:00:33.966 --> 00:00:34.766
Wait the day after tomorrow

18
00:00:34.766 --> 00:00:37.333
He got a hundred billion dollar restoration of the Empire State Building.

19
00:00:37.333 --> 00:00:40.400
Longyanchi, the head of the project and Longteng Group

20
00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:41.700
Dragon Governor Cooperation

21
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.900
Then you can become a newcomer to the sea market

22
00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:48.500
At that time, I will say goodbye to you

23
00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:49.166
Shi Ranran

24
00:00:49.166 --> 00:00:51.400
Isn't Cloud 100 BBQ also to feed you?

25
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.666
Food, clothing and housing from childhood to adulthood

26
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.533
Which one is not earned by Cloud 100 BBQ?

27
00:00:56.533 --> 00:00:58.833
Why are you doing this to him you shut up

28
00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:00.366
You are just his soft-hearted

29
00:01:00.366 --> 00:01:01.966
The adopted daughter who picked it up by the way

30
00:01:01.966 --> 00:01:03.866
What right do you have to lie here?

31
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:06.633
He didn't.

32
00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.500
Do you think I'm dragging you down again?

33
00:01:16.533 --> 00:01:17.866
Did you know that

34
00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.600
The Dragon Rock you are after

35
00:01:20.666 --> 00:01:23.000
Just someone who works for me

36
00:01:24.333 --> 00:01:25.900
Work for you

37
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.566
You don't even see what you are

38
00:01:28.566 --> 00:01:30.966
Okay, don't waste time here

39
00:01:30.966 --> 00:01:32.366
Sign it

40
00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.066
Just your kennel

41
00:01:38.133 --> 00:01:41.566
I don't want people to stay in an extra room for a second

42
00:01:41.566 --> 00:01:43.433
Scary smell

43
00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:48.433
relieved

44
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.200
If you mean it yourself

45
00:01:52.966 --> 00:01:54.666
Then you say it yourself

46
00:01:54.666 --> 00:01:56.600
Or are you on top now?

47
00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.433
I'm a mother

48
00:01:58.933 --> 00:02:01.066
I don't deserve to say a word to you

49
00:02:01.066 --> 00:02:02.366
You are enough

50
00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.700
You don't act in this star

51
00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.066
Don't you just want money when you say so much?

52
00:02:07.566 --> 00:02:08.600
I'll give it to you.

53
00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.033
1 million enough
