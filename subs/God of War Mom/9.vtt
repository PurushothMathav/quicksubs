00:00:07.533 --> 00:00:08.933
You're talking about this stuff, right?

2
00:00:08.933 --> 00:00:10.900
Why is it with you?

3
00:00:10.933 --> 00:00:13.466
Of course my daughter respects me

4
00:00:13.466 --> 00:00:15.333
He said this jade is warm jade.

5
00:00:15.333 --> 00:00:16.666
Suitable for my physique

6
00:00:16.666 --> 00:00:18.066
Warm in winter and cool in summer

7
00:00:19.466 --> 00:00:22.000
Shi Ran Ran, this is your father's relic

8
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.566
You gave him away in order to cling to the powerful

9
00:00:24.566 --> 00:00:26.333
Isn't it given by that short-lived ghost father?

10
00:00:26.333 --> 00:00:27.600
What's the big deal?

11
00:00:27.766 --> 00:00:29.200
If my godmother didn't like it

12
00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.066
I would have thrown him down the drain long ago

13
00:00:31.066 --> 00:00:34.200
Godmother, this dead person's thing is also unlucky

14
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.533
If you like it

15
00:00:35.533 --> 00:00:37.400
I'll buy you better ones later.

16
00:00:39.666 --> 00:00:41.500
Take it if you want

17
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.266
Raincoat, right? Raincoat

18
00:00:58.300 --> 00:00:59.166
today

19
00:00:59.766 --> 00:01:01.233
Let you see jokes

20
00:01:02.366 --> 00:01:03.366
How come?

21
00:01:03.366 --> 00:01:04.166
Cloud smoke

22
00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.666
If it weren't for when you were looking for Ran Ran

23
00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:10.166
Found me unconscious

24
00:01:10.166 --> 00:01:12.200
Bring me back and raise me

25
00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.633
Then I might have died over there long ago

26
00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:18.500
Rainy Night

27
00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:23.200
It's okay, Ran Ran, he doesn't recognize you and me

28
00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:24.366
I can make money

29
00:01:24.366 --> 00:01:26.166
I will retire for you

30
00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.266
One day.

31
00:01:28.866 --> 00:01:31.500
You will also remember who your parents were

32
00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.233
You will also go to him and ask him

33
00:01:34.133 --> 00:01:35.700
Then I'll raise it together

34
00:01:41.066 --> 00:01:43.000
Also raised by me

35
00:01:43.166 --> 00:01:45.466
Why are teacups so real?

36
00:01:57.966 --> 00:01:59.666
Hello Emperor

37
00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.133
Longyanchi's sister Longjing

38
00:02:01.133 --> 00:02:03.133
Contact my Qingchuan disciple Chi Ying

39
00:02:03.133 --> 00:02:05.100
Willing to offer his inheritance

40
00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.500
I just want to see you

41
00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.433
Longjing pair

42
00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:10.500
Although Longjing is Longyanchi's sister

43
00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.233
But Warlord, you have always kept a low profile

44
00:02:12.366 --> 00:02:13.800
Do you need me to help you repay?

45
00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.000
Don't tell Longjing

46
00:02:16.466 --> 00:02:17.800
See you after the dinner

47
00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.466
A jumping clown dares to be presumptuous in front of me

48
00:02:25.333 --> 00:02:28.800
The entire sea market really needs to be rectified
