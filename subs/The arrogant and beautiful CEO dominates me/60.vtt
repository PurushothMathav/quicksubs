00:00:00.533 --> 00:00:01.700
Are you sleeping too?

2
00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:03.666
Of course I don't want to

3
00:00:03.733 --> 00:00:05.000
I want to go home now.

4
00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.100
The farmhouse is not going, not going

5
00:00:08.266 --> 00:00:10.500
Well then we'll just have to walk back

6
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.966
The car broke down, of course I walked back

7
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.033
It's 30 kilometers away from the city center.

8
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.300
Are you sure you can

9
00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:22.033
Of course, I was a long-distance running champion in college

10
00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.100
No, it's different now.

11
00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:26.300
What's the difference?

12
00:00:26.733 --> 00:00:27.933
Is there me now?

13
00:00:27.933 --> 00:00:29.600
I can't bear to let you walk so much

14
00:00:32.333 --> 00:00:33.400
Come on the horse

15
00:00:33.933 --> 00:00:36.466
I'm a runaway horse now hey

16
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.066
Here we go.

17
00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.100
What Fang Chen actually retreated completely?

18
00:00:45.866 --> 00:00:46.666
YANYAN

19
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.966
Do you think Fang Chen really has a big background?

20
00:00:51.166 --> 00:00:52.966
No matter what his background is

21
00:00:53.366 --> 00:00:55.466
Even if we can't handle him

22
00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:57.900
Of course someone will deal with him

23
00:00:58.066 --> 00:01:02.566
But His Highness still has to sacrifice Xiao Yunyan?

24
00:01:02.766 --> 00:01:04.366
Hahaha
