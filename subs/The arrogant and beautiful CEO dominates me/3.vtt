00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:03.966
Did you see it?

2
00:00:03.966 --> 00:00:05.566
My wife came to pick me up

3
00:00:05.733 --> 00:00:07.833
Here we go.

4
00:00:16.933 --> 00:00:18.866
50,000 for it

5
00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:20.700
What to do

6
00:00:21.733 --> 00:00:22.966
Shao Dong of Shenghe Group

7
00:00:22.966 --> 00:00:25.166
Ask Wang Tian to invite me to lunch to talk about the project

8
00:00:25.166 --> 00:00:27.166
50,000 to pretend to be my fiancé

9
00:00:27.166 --> 00:00:29.000
Let him die, this crooked thought

10
00:00:29.266 --> 00:00:32.466
Then why don't you quickly ask your husband to pretend?

11
00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:35.133
Aren't you a walk-on and shoot short videos?

12
00:00:35.133 --> 00:00:37.666
That's a lot more money than you can make running for a year

13
00:00:37.666 --> 00:00:38.466
What are you doing?

14
00:00:38.466 --> 00:00:41.166
Take the scene of Yufeng kneeling as a joke

15
00:00:42.166 --> 00:00:43.333
How to do it or not

16
00:00:43.333 --> 00:00:46.433
Give me a good word, I'll do it

17
00:00:49.566 --> 00:00:51.266
Master, it's been 30 minutes

18
00:00:51.266 --> 00:00:53.400
Do you think Xiao Yunyan will come?

19
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.600
If he doesn't come

20
00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.433
The Xiao family is finished

21
00:00:57.466 --> 00:00:58.766
You are also trash

22
00:00:58.766 --> 00:01:01.533
I drugged you last night and let someone run away

23
00:01:01.533 --> 00:01:04.033
It's better to keep you than to keep a few pugs

24
00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:07.300
Dolomite

25
00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:08.666
There you are.

26
00:01:10.766 --> 00:01:14.800
This is my fiancé, Wang Chen

27
00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.700
Come to talk about the project and bring your fiancé

28
00:01:18.166 --> 00:01:19.833
But your fiancé

29
00:01:20.266 --> 00:01:23.066
Why does it feel like I haven't eaten in eight lifetimes?

30
00:01:23.666 --> 00:01:24.833
Are you a pig?

31
00:01:25.066 --> 00:01:26.266
Starving ghost reincarnation?

32
00:01:26.266 --> 00:01:28.600
I paid for it, can you help me?

33
00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:30.900
If you are full, you can step on the second generation of rich people.

34
00:01:32.066 --> 00:01:34.766
It was a mistake to find this guy

35
00:01:34.933 --> 00:01:36.566
It's a disgrace.
