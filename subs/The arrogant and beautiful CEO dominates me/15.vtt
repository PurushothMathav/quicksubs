00:00:00.866 --> 00:00:03.366
Sure enough, it is easy to daydream if you run too much

2
00:00:03.366 --> 00:00:05.166
Three sentences are inseparable from bragging.

3
00:00:05.166 --> 00:00:06.300
Prove it to me

4
00:00:11.333 --> 00:00:13.400
I'm sorry your phone is out of order.

5
00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.000
Please continue to pay the phone bill.

6
00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:16.600
Excuse me?

7
00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:17.666
in arrears

8
00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.000
You still want to save the Xiao family's crisis

9
00:00:24.133 --> 00:00:25.666
So?

10
00:00:26.333 --> 00:00:27.800
Lose the number to me

11
00:00:28.266 --> 00:00:31.100
Accident, there was still a phone bill yesterday.

12
00:00:34.766 --> 00:00:36.466
I've been out of luck for eight lifetimes

13
00:00:36.866 --> 00:00:38.500
Put yourself in it

14
00:00:38.533 --> 00:00:40.466
I'll charge you the phone bill.

15
00:00:42.733 --> 00:00:44.400
Didn't I just give you 100,000?

16
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.266
Take that money and leave Dragon City

17
00:00:47.166 --> 00:00:49.700
That poison grandpa didn't believe it at all

18
00:00:52.166 --> 00:00:53.666
Although you don't remember me

19
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.700
But the way you care hasn't changed

20
00:01:03.866 --> 00:01:05.000
Who?

21
00:01:07.466 --> 00:01:08.400
Ah!

22
00:01:11.333 --> 00:01:12.966
Ah Kunshang
