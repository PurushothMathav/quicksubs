00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:02.433
Ah Kunshang

2
00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:08.200
I don't know if you are here

3
00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:09.466
Don't move my knees

4
00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:11.033
How violent it makes me

5
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:12.800
Yes

6
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.300
Why did Shenghe Group suddenly become rich by 5 billion?

7
00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:17.700
Also contact the sales staff directly

8
00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.166
I don't know that either.

9
00:00:20.466 --> 00:00:23.066
A few months ago, I ran into Wang Tian's father

10
00:00:23.566 --> 00:00:26.266
When he found out who I was, he gave me 5 billion

11
00:00:28.333 --> 00:00:30.166
I just agreed to step into the Heavenly Soul Hall

12
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:32.600
Your Majesty knows

13
00:00:32.766 --> 00:00:34.100
We never interfere

14
00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.066
Things run by other people's companies

15
00:00:37.266 --> 00:00:38.666
Hey, please go to Xifuru

16
00:00:39.666 --> 00:00:42.166
Okay, didn't you just say it?

17
00:00:42.166 --> 00:00:43.766
Don't kneel at every turn

18
00:00:44.133 --> 00:00:47.266
Your aura is too powerful

19
00:00:47.266 --> 00:00:48.366
I couldn't help myself.

20
00:00:49.166 --> 00:00:50.400
OK, OK, OK.

21
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.133
When you accept the younger brother in the future

22
00:00:52.133 --> 00:00:53.600
Just keep your eyes on your shoes.

23
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.033
So what's next?

24
00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:58.733
Longhai City's top ten groups

25
00:00:58.733 --> 00:00:59.833
Qingcheng Group

26
00:01:00.133 --> 00:01:01.800
Although the assets are not as good as the top five

27
00:01:01.933 --> 00:01:03.500
But the recoil is great

28
00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.266
Buy it and give it to Xiao Yunyan

29
00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:06.700
But the medal

30
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.433
The boss behind that company is also me

31
00:01:10.766 --> 00:01:12.166
That's better

32
00:01:12.166 --> 00:01:13.033
Give it to Xiao Yunyan

33
00:01:13.933 --> 00:01:14.766
Ah!

34
00:01:16.066 --> 00:01:17.000
It's ok.

35
00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.500
Hey wife is very strange

36
00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.466
Things suddenly worked out perfectly

37
00:01:26.466 --> 00:01:29.100
And grandpa said he wanted to see you. Don't worry.

38
00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.900
I won't trouble you this time.

39
00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:32.633
OK, I'll be right there.

40
00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.700
The little fat man is quite efficient this time
