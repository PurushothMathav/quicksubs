00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.700
Fengchen, you are finally here

2
00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:03.700
Sister Tan, what's so urgent?

3
00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:04.800
I'm exhausted.

4
00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.966
100,000 bucks for a night

5
00:00:06.966 --> 00:00:09.066
100,000 you insult me

6
00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:11.966
Not enough, at least 1 million

7
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.200
As long as the next thing is done

8
00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.333
I give you 3 million house

9
00:00:16.333 --> 00:00:18.066
Tan, I'm just kidding

10
00:00:18.066 --> 00:00:19.233
So what's going on?

11
00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:20.433
If you can help me, I will definitely help

12
00:00:21.366 --> 00:00:22.800
Then I really said

13
00:00:23.766 --> 00:00:27.166
Well, I want you to be my husband.

14
00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.033
Oops, it's fake.

15
00:00:30.066 --> 00:00:31.333
To deceive my mother

16
00:00:31.333 --> 00:00:33.400
Don't force me to go on a blind date with his rich second generation

17
00:00:33.533 --> 00:00:34.666
That's fine.

18
00:00:34.666 --> 00:00:36.466
You can eat spicy food in the future

19
00:00:36.466 --> 00:00:38.066
I don't like him!

20
00:00:38.366 --> 00:00:41.100
My mom threatened to repossess the house

21
00:00:41.333 --> 00:00:44.000
So I'm going to ask you to pretend to be my husband

22
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.300
And let my mom give up

23
00:00:45.533 --> 00:00:46.933
I already have a wife

24
00:00:46.933 --> 00:00:47.966
Not very convenient.

25
00:00:48.566 --> 00:00:50.800
Why don't you ask your mother to take that house back?

26
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.700
You should be filial to his old man

27
00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.300
I'm counting on him to live

28
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.900
What do you want me to do in the future?

29
00:00:59.933 --> 00:01:01.100
You take this card

30
00:01:01.533 --> 00:01:02.700
Any future high-end consumption

31
00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:04.966
Luxury stores can spend for free.

32
00:01:04.966 --> 00:01:07.266
It can also be used to save lives when necessary

33
00:01:07.533 --> 00:01:10.133
Yo Yo Yo real or fake

34
00:01:10.133 --> 00:01:12.366
You wouldn't lie to me with a fake card, would you?
