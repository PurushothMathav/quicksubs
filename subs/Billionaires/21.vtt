00:00:02.133 --> 00:00:03.033
Nope.

2
00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:05.233
If it weren't for you

3
00:00:05.333 --> 00:00:07.500
I'm sure I'm doomed tonight

4
00:00:07.666 --> 00:00:10.066
Is your ex-boyfriend still making things difficult for you?

5
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.533
Yeah, but I can fix this in a minute.

6
00:00:14.533 --> 00:00:16.066
Start a new life

7
00:00:16.266 --> 00:00:17.933
Hmm

8
00:00:17.933 --> 00:00:20.100
How about you? Did you find your sister?

9
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.033
Well, it's not what was expected, though

10
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.800
But things are going in the right direction.

11
00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:28.966
Hmm, that's fine.

12
00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:33.300
You saved my life three times before that

13
00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.600
I have nothing to repay

14
00:00:37.933 --> 00:00:40.366
This is the bracelet I grew up wearing.

15
00:00:40.366 --> 00:00:42.000
Just give it to your sister.

16
00:00:42.333 --> 00:00:44.766
Hope he likes it.

17
00:00:47.466 --> 00:00:48.433
Thanks.

18
00:00:51.566 --> 00:00:53.100
Good luck getting rid of scum

19
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.433
Restart a new life

20
00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.100
Excuse me?

21
00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.866
I have some work to attend to

22
00:01:04.866 --> 00:01:07.033
I can't accompany you. It doesn't matter if you are discharged from the hospital.

23
00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:08.400
Go to work

24
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.866
I've been here all these years by myself.

25
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.500
Can take care of yourself

26
00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.233
I'll ask my brother to accompany you later.

27
00:01:17.266 --> 00:01:19.466
He is the hottest star in the country today

28
00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.100
You little girls will love him

29
00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.566
As a reward for the gift you gave my sister

30
00:01:26.266 --> 00:01:27.166
You rest first

31
00:01:27.166 --> 00:01:29.633
You'll see him when you wake up
