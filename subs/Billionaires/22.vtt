00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:06.300
Obviously I haven't seen this girl a few times

2
00:00:06.666 --> 00:00:08.266
Why do you always feel so kind?

3
00:00:15.666 --> 00:00:16.566
Pay quickly

4
00:00:16.566 --> 00:00:18.100
Otherwise, the junk in your room

5
00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:19.566
I'll find someone to throw away today

6
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.433
This man speaks so rudely

7
00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:26.166
How much does he owe you?

8
00:00:26.166 --> 00:00:27.500
I'll give it to you.

9
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.500
It's his boyfriend who eats soft rice

10
00:00:30.133 --> 00:00:31.433
Stop being funny

11
00:00:31.533 --> 00:00:33.133
If it weren't for you vampire

12
00:00:33.133 --> 00:00:35.000
He is an honest girl

13
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.666
How can you work ten jobs a day and still not pay the rent?

14
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.433
I see.

15
00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.800
Send your account number to this phone.

16
00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:47.800
I'll have someone call you for the money later

17
00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.033
I didn't expect it.

18
00:00:55.066 --> 00:00:57.833
My fan base is everywhere.

19
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.766
Who are you and why are you holding my phone?

20
00:01:04.866 --> 00:01:08.600
Am I not the man you miss on your wallpaper?

21
00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:12.533
Why am I standing in front of you now?

22
00:01:12.533 --> 00:01:13.766
I don't know.

23
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.733
You are the best actor

24
00:01:16.733 --> 00:01:17.666
Record it

25
00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.566
It seems that the brain is not damaged.

26
00:01:22.266 --> 00:01:24.366
Since you are so short of money

27
00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:27.766
Be my personal assistant

28
00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:30.833
How did it go?
