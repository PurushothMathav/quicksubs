00:00:01.333 --> 00:00:04.000
Who allowed you to speak? You are not welcome in our house.

2
00:00:05.733 --> 00:00:07.833
Little sister, are you going too far?

3
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.600
Obviously we are family

4
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.400
You're protecting an outsider?

5
00:00:15.333 --> 00:00:17.300
That's not what I mean.

6
00:00:18.066 --> 00:00:19.766
Since you like him so much

7
00:00:19.766 --> 00:00:21.666
Just consider him a sister

8
00:00:23.466 --> 00:00:25.366
You are our most precious sister.

9
00:00:25.366 --> 00:00:26.700
No nonsense

10
00:00:29.333 --> 00:00:30.400
Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes

11
00:00:31.166 --> 00:00:33.500
What happened today is that I didn't think it through.

12
00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.200
Not next time.

13
00:00:36.533 --> 00:00:37.433
I don't care.

14
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.700
You have to fire him

15
00:00:40.333 --> 00:00:42.166
Otherwise I'll run away from home tomorrow

16
00:00:52.866 --> 00:00:54.500
I messed up everything

17
00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:57.433
I respect Miss Lu's decision

18
00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.366
Count your senior brother

19
00:01:10.933 --> 00:01:13.066
I have asked various other media to contact

20
00:01:13.066 --> 00:01:14.466
Retract today's news

21
00:01:14.733 --> 00:01:16.666
You go back to your room and tidy up for a while

22
00:01:16.666 --> 00:01:18.466
We had dinner with grandpa

23
00:01:25.966 --> 00:01:27.966
I just look at his little girl pitifully

24
00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.633
I want to offer him a job

25
00:01:29.666 --> 00:01:31.366
I didn't want to make my little sister angry

26
00:01:32.133 --> 00:01:33.600
I know you are kind

27
00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.633
But you really did something wrong about this.

28
00:01:36.933 --> 00:01:40.100
You beg grandpa for guilt yourself, you know

29
00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.100
Brother, I beg you something
