00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:01.200
Sorry.

2
00:00:05.766 --> 00:00:08.433
Bitch, you bitch dare to seduce my boyfriend

3
00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:11.700
Seen shameless

4
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.766
I've never seen such a shameless one

5
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.200
You cheated on me when I caught you

6
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.066
It seems to have happened yesterday

7
00:00:18.066 --> 00:00:21.233
Don't tell me you got a new love in one day

8
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:25.766
I don't need you to worry about my business

9
00:00:25.933 --> 00:00:27.833
You think I want to take care of your shit

10
00:00:30.666 --> 00:00:32.833
You're a country bumpkin.

11
00:00:32.933 --> 00:00:34.533
Pretty bold

12
00:00:34.533 --> 00:00:35.700
You came just in time

13
00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.166
What's your research project?

14
00:00:37.166 --> 00:00:38.666
Don't you need money urgently?

15
00:00:38.766 --> 00:00:40.566
As long as you help me solve Luo Yuan

16
00:00:40.566 --> 00:00:43.500
I'll give you 1 million, Chen family

17
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.600
You heard it too

18
00:00:50.933 --> 00:00:54.233
Summer champion took 1 million to your face

19
00:00:55.366 --> 00:00:57.066
This is a cafe.

20
00:00:57.266 --> 00:00:58.500
How dare you do anything to me?

21
00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.433
You can't escape either, you know?

22
00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.466
If the research is unsuccessful

23
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.500
I am an outlaw

24
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.166
What's there to consider?

25
00:01:08.466 --> 00:01:11.100
For the sake of old love

26
00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.466
You go to accompany wine or sell blood

27
00:01:13.466 --> 00:01:16.433
Give me a million at noon tomorrow

28
00:01:16.566 --> 00:01:18.033
I'll let you go.

29
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:19.900
After the event

30
00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.100
I can also consider being with you again

31
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.366
I won't give you another penny in your dream.

32
00:01:26.566 --> 00:01:29.133
Okay, don't listen to advice, right?

33
00:01:29.133 --> 00:01:30.966
Then it's not my fault.

34
00:01:38.666 --> 00:01:40.566
Overreaching waste

35
00:01:40.566 --> 00:01:44.800
Today, I will remove the hard bones from your body

36
00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:46.900
Crush one by one

37
00:01:49.533 --> 00:01:50.766
Who is your dog man?

38
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.400
Dare to force me to call this song The Poor Family
