00:00:07.066 --> 00:00:08.900
Uh, sorry.

2
00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:10.166
Traffic jam on the road

3
00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:11.533
So a little late

4
00:00:11.533 --> 00:00:11.966
You are not

5
00:00:11.966 --> 00:00:14.166
The little girl we mistook at school that day?

6
00:00:14.166 --> 00:00:15.633
How did you come to the press conference?

7
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:17.600
I sent him.

8
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.433
He is now

9
00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:22.400
He's my assistant.

10
00:00:26.466 --> 00:00:28.000
Such a heavy occasion today

11
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.366
As my assistant

12
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:30.866
How can you dress like that?

13
00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:33.433
Come with me!

14
00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:38.400
Ah, that's all practice.

15
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.166
Latest haute couture

16
00:00:40.166 --> 00:00:41.100
Take your pick.

17
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.566
No, that's too expensive.

18
00:00:46.733 --> 00:00:49.033
I can't afford to break it

19
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.400
Oops, don't dawdle, get in

20
00:01:03.866 --> 00:01:06.600
The press conference is about to start, big brother is looking for you everywhere

21
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.266
What are you still doing here?

22
00:01:08.966 --> 00:01:10.066
Immediately

23
00:01:11.466 --> 00:01:12.366
