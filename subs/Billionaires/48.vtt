00:00:00.666 --> 00:00:02.666
I should be asking you this

2
00:00:02.666 --> 00:00:03.900
You see clearly

3
00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:05.500
This is obviously the car I took

4
00:00:05.866 --> 00:00:09.266
This little girl can't be the last car, right?

5
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:11.300
pay

6
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Anyway, on the way

7
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.400
Then let's go together

8
00:00:15.333 --> 00:00:17.600
Okay, then you transfer the fare to me.

9
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:20.200
A total of 30 yuan 8

10
00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.966
Just transfer me 15 yuan.

11
00:00:26.666 --> 00:00:31.600
Come on! This guy is so poor he doesn't even have 15 bucks.

12
00:00:33.566 --> 00:00:35.566
I don't have any cash on me

13
00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.633
You can swipe as many as you want with this card.

14
00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:41.366
Give me back my credit card and ask me to pay off your debts

15
00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.700
Uh, no.

16
00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:45.600
For the sake of your injury today

17
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.100
I'll give you a ride.

18
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.566
Just got out of a dust pit

19
00:00:53.566 --> 00:00:55.700
How did I meet another liar?

20
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.866
Luckily I didn't tell him about the hotel that day

21
00:01:00.766 --> 00:01:04.200
Hello, you two are here, thank you.

22
00:01:06.766 --> 00:01:09.266
Why is the mobile phone so broken that it has not been replaced?

23
00:01:10.866 --> 00:01:14.366
Miss, I have arrived at the address you located.

24
00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:15.900
May I ask who you are?

25
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.866
I've arrived.

26
00:01:20.266 --> 00:01:21.600
Could it be

27
00:01:22.333 --> 00:01:24.766
We took the wrong bus

28
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.100
charges

29
00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.266
Thank you for your hard work, hurry up, hurry up, hurry up
