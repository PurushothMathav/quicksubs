00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:02.233
If you are interested, remember to come and see.

2
00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:16.200
You have a cavity in your upper tooth.

3
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:17.500
Looks a little clingy

4
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:19.033
Why haven't you been treated?

5
00:00:19.066 --> 00:00:21.033
Because I have a sweet tooth.

6
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:22.966
But afraid of surgery

7
00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.866
So I kept dragging and didn't dare to come to the hospital

8
00:00:27.866 --> 00:00:30.633
Seventh brother, I don't want to go to the hospital

9
00:00:30.666 --> 00:00:31.966
Let alone surgery

10
00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.266
Grandpa said Mom just fell on the operating table

11
00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.566
What's wrong with Dr. Lu?

12
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.400
Ah, nothing.

13
00:00:41.666 --> 00:00:42.133
Your cavities

14
00:00:42.133 --> 00:00:44.066
Has severely affected other dental nerves

15
00:00:44.066 --> 00:00:45.366
Must be cured as soon as possible

16
00:00:45.733 --> 00:00:46.333
Don't worry.

17
00:00:46.333 --> 00:00:48.400
At that time, I will personally give you a stable treatment.

18
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:49.833
Don't be afraid.

19
00:00:51.466 --> 00:00:52.400
Oh, I see.

20
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:53.500
Thank you doctor

21
00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:01.633
His condition

22
00:01:01.733 --> 00:01:04.100
Why do you think so with your little sister when you were a child?

23
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.633
There will be an error in the test report.

24
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.666
She's not our sister at all.

25
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.266
Dr. Ye

26
00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:17.600
I just handed you a sample as a nurse

27
00:01:17.666 --> 00:01:19.633
Please help me with a DNA test

28
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.500
No, I have to tell my brother about this ASAP.
