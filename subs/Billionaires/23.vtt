1
00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.833
It's always a road that strangers approach

2
00:00:03.133 --> 00:00:06.700
Why is it completely inconsistent with the cold image on TV?

3
00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.366
Mr. Chen, don't come here

4
00:00:09.366 --> 00:00:10.633
Be careful, I'll call the police.

5
00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:13.066
Regular occupation

6
00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.000
What are you thinking about?

7
00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.466
You didn't lie to me.

8
00:00:17.966 --> 00:00:19.700
Just your little body

9
00:00:19.733 --> 00:00:21.400
What is worth deceiving?

10
00:00:21.666 --> 00:00:23.766
One hundred thousand a month.

11
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.300
Not enough. How about 1 million?

12
00:00:34.766 --> 00:00:38.166
It's a deal, but it's just work, I can't make an appointment.

13
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.200
I'm a gentleman

14
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.000
Don't ruin my image

15
00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.400
How is he awake?

16
00:00:49.466 --> 00:00:51.366
Yeah. Yeah.

17
00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:53.300
Looks normal

18
00:00:53.466 --> 00:00:55.066
Don't worry about handling the work.

19
00:00:55.133 --> 00:00:56.100
That would be fine.

20
00:00:56.166 --> 00:00:58.800
Remember not to be late for tomorrow's press conference

21
00:00:58.800 --> 00:00:59.633
Do you know?
