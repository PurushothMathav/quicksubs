00:00:06.933 --> 00:00:09.866
Promise I already know everything

2
00:00:09.866 --> 00:00:11.833
Can you give me another chance?

3
00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:13.466
Even you dare

4
00:00:13.466 --> 00:00:16.466
Little think of our sister overreaching

5
00:00:16.766 --> 00:00:18.500
This is the little sister's own business.

6
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.433
Let him decide for himself

7
00:00:22.266 --> 00:00:23.800
I don't know.

8
00:00:30.466 --> 00:00:31.600
From today onwards

9
00:00:32.066 --> 00:00:33.833
The Lu Group will be handed over to you.

10
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.900
Brother, I have no management experience.

11
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:38.200
I really can't

12
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.800
What if the company management goes bankrupt?

13
00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:42.400
You can rely on your own abilities

14
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.966
Won the toughest riverside garden project in the industry

15
00:00:44.966 --> 00:00:47.466
This shows that your ability is outstanding enough

16
00:00:47.566 --> 00:00:49.000
You have to believe in yourself.

17
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.533
Brother, I really can't

18
00:00:51.533 --> 00:00:53.200
Will you stay with me?

19
00:00:54.666 --> 00:00:55.466
Don't be afraid.

20
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.200
Anyway, our Lu family can have today's status

21
00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.033
The bottom is by no means the only industry of Lu Enterprises Group

22
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.766
Bankrupt is bankrupt

23
00:01:02.766 --> 00:01:05.100
Brother, what are you talking about?

24
00:01:05.866 --> 00:01:06.866
I'm kidding.

25
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.600
Big brother has confidence in you. Come on.
