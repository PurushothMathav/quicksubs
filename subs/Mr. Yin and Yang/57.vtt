1
00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.633
Remnant Emperor Blood Moon

2
00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.500
Big brother

3
00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:05.966
I'm afraid tonight

4
00:00:05.966 --> 00:00:08.300
I bald your ghost daughter-in-law today

5
00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:09.733
What tonight?

6
00:00:09.733 --> 00:00:11.733
No revenge tonight

7
00:00:11.733 --> 00:00:13.366
The blood moon has remnants and is slow

8
00:00:13.366 --> 00:00:14.933
Bimonthly same day overcast

9
00:00:14.933 --> 00:00:16.400
Lifetime is bad

10
00:00:16.766 --> 00:00:19.366
The pair of strange daughters-in-law of the Ding family has greatly increased

11
00:00:19.533 --> 00:00:21.000
The talisman I invited

12
00:00:21.333 --> 00:00:23.566
I can't control them anymore, grandpa

13
00:00:23.566 --> 00:00:25.500
But if they don't come to the door

14
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.433
How do we know where they are?

15
00:00:27.666 --> 00:00:29.366
They don't come

16
00:00:29.466 --> 00:00:32.566
Then you go and lure them out

17
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.166
Come on, grandpa, why are you me again?

18
00:00:36.166 --> 00:00:37.866
Can you change someone?

19
00:00:38.966 --> 00:00:42.033
If you don't go because of the trouble you caused, who will go?

20
00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.166
You're going to the mass grave tonight

21
00:00:44.366 --> 00:00:47.266
Carry back the tombstone of your ghost daughter-in-law

22
00:00:47.266 --> 00:00:49.766
The tombstone has to be memorized.

23
00:00:49.766 --> 00:00:51.366
How accounting are you?

24
00:00:51.366 --> 00:00:54.033
Grandpa, are you kidding me?

25
00:00:54.066 --> 00:00:56.866
Do you think I look like a lunatic?

26
00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.033
Tombstone leads the way

27
00:00:59.133 --> 00:01:00.400
Evil spirits follow

28
00:01:00.466 --> 00:01:01.466
Where is the tombstone?

29
00:01:01.466 --> 00:01:04.066
Where can your ghost daughter-in-law follow?
