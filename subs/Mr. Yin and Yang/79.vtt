1
00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:11.600
Eyes are afraid of three long and two short

2
00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:13.700
Afraid of two short and one long

3
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:16.100
Why do I feel so frightened?

4
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.466
Nothing will happen to the spring night, right?

5
00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:20.000
Grandpa, I'm back.

6
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:23.500
Oops, don't use umbrellas in the house

7
00:00:24.066 --> 00:00:25.400
Grandpa, you threw his umbrella away

8
00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.066
The old saying goes, no umbrellas in the house.

9
00:00:28.066 --> 00:00:29.366
No one is left in the rainy night

10
00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.200
You came back from the mass grave

11
00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.900
I'm afraid there are some dirty things hidden in the umbrella.

12
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:34.966
You fight in the house

13
00:00:34.966 --> 00:00:37.200
You bring the dirty stuff into your house.

14
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.066
Hey, not grandpa

15
00:00:39.066 --> 00:00:41.400
Where are you going that night?

16
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.266
I asked my father to cheat from the Patriarch's Hall

17
00:00:44.266 --> 00:00:45.566
Make an appointment tomorrow morning

18
00:00:45.566 --> 00:00:47.866
You have to knock some patriarchs in the Patriarch's Museum

19
00:00:47.866 --> 00:00:48.900
I'm leaving now

20
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.466
I'll be there tomorrow morning.

21
00:00:51.466 --> 00:00:53.333
You close the doors and windows at home

22
00:00:53.333 --> 00:00:54.700
Don't go out there
