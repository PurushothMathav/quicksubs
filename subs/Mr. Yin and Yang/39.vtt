00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:02.166
Hey, it's really rewarding

2
00:00:02.166 --> 00:00:03.200
Evil pays off

3
00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:05.166
Remember to deserve to die

4
00:00:05.666 --> 00:00:08.600
If this is a revenge killing, it's understandable

5
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:10.566
But they're killing innocent people.

6
00:00:10.566 --> 00:00:12.233
That was their crime.

7
00:00:12.333 --> 00:00:15.000
Go back and get ready

8
00:00:16.366 --> 00:00:18.633
Grandpa, aren't we going home?

9
00:00:18.666 --> 00:00:20.233
Why did you come to this grocery store?

10
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.033
I'm going on a long trip.

11
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.233
The mother-in-law and daughter-in-law already know where our family is

12
00:00:25.266 --> 00:00:27.066
If I leave you alone at home

13
00:00:27.066 --> 00:00:28.766
Are you going to serve them as a dish?

14
00:00:28.766 --> 00:00:32.466
Where are you going, grandpa?

15
00:00:32.566 --> 00:00:35.900
Before Li Yanhuang died, there was a mouthful of resentment that slaughtered his throat

16
00:00:36.133 --> 00:00:37.366
Become a ghost

17
00:00:37.366 --> 00:00:38.866
Very fierce

18
00:00:39.133 --> 00:00:41.300
I'm going to find a more powerful magic weapon

19
00:00:41.333 --> 00:00:43.466
To hold him back?

20
00:00:43.466 --> 00:00:45.300
Grandpa, how long do you have to go?

21
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.466
At least a day or two

22
00:00:46.466 --> 00:00:48.766
Ten more days and a half months, I can't tell.

23
00:00:48.866 --> 00:00:50.666
Oops grandpa

24
00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.700
You have to come back early

25
00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:55.433
In case those ghost hearts come to the door again

26
00:00:56.166 --> 00:00:59.533
I'm afraid you know you're afraid now, right?

27
00:00:59.533 --> 00:01:01.533
When you provoked the Li family

28
00:01:01.533 --> 00:01:02.900
I see you are very happy

29
00:01:03.166 --> 00:01:06.200
Then I wasn't fascinated

30
00:01:06.366 --> 00:01:07.366
Cut the crap

31
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.166
There are three rules for obeying the store.

32
00:01:10.166 --> 00:01:11.566
You remember me.

33
00:01:11.566 --> 00:01:13.200
Impossible

34
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.566
two idle

35
00:01:14.566 --> 00:01:16.000
30% off

36
00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:17.900
Broke that rule

37
00:01:17.966 --> 00:01:19.266
got in trouble

38
00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:20.600
Take it with you.

39
00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.833
Grandpa, don't worry. Okay.

40
00:01:25.666 --> 00:01:27.033
Good old days

41
00:01:28.133 --> 00:01:29.866
Heaven and earth open

42
00:01:31.066 --> 00:01:32.633
Mr. Bai Kui to death

43
00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.066
Manager Chen Jiaxiu'e girl

44
00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.166
Money general

45
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.666
Activist
