00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:06.300
Let's go, open the door on the first day of junior high school

2
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:08.533
Mother is here to bring you dinner

3
00:00:08.533 --> 00:00:11.900
It's your favorite dumpling.

4
00:00:12.966 --> 00:00:15.766
No, I didn't tell my mother at all when I went out

5
00:00:15.766 --> 00:00:17.566
How could he possibly know I was in Elm Mouth?

6
00:00:18.733 --> 00:00:19.633
Chu Yi

7
00:00:19.666 --> 00:00:23.066
Why don't you even listen to your mother? I can't hear you

8
00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.100
You made a mistake at the well

9
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:27.466
This house can't protect you anymore

10
00:00:27.466 --> 00:00:30.233
Go home with grandpa grandpa

11
00:00:47.566 --> 00:00:50.500
Girl, you're not coming home at night

12
00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.300
Why are you crying alone here?

13
00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:55.400
Brother, can you help me?

14
00:00:56.733 --> 00:00:57.466
aunt

15
00:00:57.466 --> 00:01:00.700
You have to tell me what it is to help you.

16
00:01:02.566 --> 00:01:05.566
My parents for 20 dollars

17
00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:09.033
Marry me to a dying sick kidney

18
00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.766
I risked my life to run away from home

19
00:01:13.266 --> 00:01:14.700
little brother

20
00:01:15.566 --> 00:01:17.366
Can you take me in?

21
00:01:18.266 --> 00:01:20.866
Girl, why are your hands so cold?

22
00:01:20.866 --> 00:01:22.800
When did I come here?

23
00:01:23.133 --> 00:01:25.033
Cold dew at night

24
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.933
You see my clothes are all wet

25
00:01:28.933 --> 00:01:29.533
that

26
00:01:29.533 --> 00:01:31.766
Then you come into the house with me first to warm up.

27
00:01:31.766 --> 00:01:32.633
Let's go
