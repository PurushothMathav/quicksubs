You have to live to go too

3
00:00:03.566 --> 00:00:05.966
All actors should be pasted with white paper

4
00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:10.200
If the white paper actor wants to live, give it to me

5
00:00:12.766 --> 00:00:13.566
Thousand miles

6
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.866
You go and prepare an old rooster that is born forever

7
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.266
The sooner the better

8
00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:27.766

Erkou hehehe

10
00:00:29.766 --> 00:00:31.933
Hey, are you having a wedding event?

11
00:00:31.933 --> 00:00:33.700
Oh, let me tell you.

12
00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.566
This dad is also mom

13
00:00:35.566 --> 00:00:36.666
Your wife?

14
00:00:36.933 --> 00:00:38.566
I have been lively

15
00:00:38.566 --> 00:00:39.466
Ha ha.

16
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.200
Mr. Liu, you are bullshitting from there, hurry up and leave

17
00:00:42.266 --> 00:00:43.600
Don't you believe it?

18
00:00:43.666 --> 00:00:45.166
I'll bet you that.

19
00:00:45.266 --> 00:00:46.400
Your wife?

20
00:00:46.533 --> 00:00:48.466
I've already let someone else sleep

21
00:00:48.466 --> 00:00:50.466
Hahaha, someone arches your hand and sleeps

22
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.166
Let his mother scold the harder the better

23
00:00:54.166 --> 00:00:56.233
It doesn't hurt you.

24
00:00:57.566 --> 00:00:58.366
Tiger Lord

25
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.466
Your bride was slept with

26
00:01:01.566 --> 00:01:02.766
Your wife?

27
00:01:02.766 --> 00:01:04.933
I can't live through the door, hahaha.

28
00:01:04.933 --> 00:01:09.400
You have a wedding event today and your whole family will die tomorrow, hahaha.

29
00:01:10.466 --> 00:01:11.500

00:01:17.166 --> 00:01:19.400
Ah, go, go, go, go.

32
00:01:45.366 --> 00:01:46.600
You are holding this chicken

33
00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.466
Turn three times in your fish son

34
00:01:48.466 --> 00:01:49.966
Chickens and dogs can't talk

35
00:01:49.966 --> 00:01:51.100
Can't look back

36
00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.200
Can't run, you know?

37
00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:55.566
Otherwise you are helpless
