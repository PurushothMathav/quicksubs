00:00:00.466 --> 00:00:02.566
Why is it you again?

2
00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:03.166
Shit

3
00:00:03.166 --> 00:00:06.166
I, I, you, you are being watched by two dirty things

4
00:00:06.166 --> 00:00:08.366
I won't sleep with you, what are you pretending to be?

5
00:00:08.366 --> 00:00:10.266
You don't open the door, do you?

6
00:00:10.366 --> 00:00:14.633
Then I really threw away the good wine and meat this time.

7
00:00:17.766 --> 00:00:19.700
Want oops

8
00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:20.700
What's dirty?

9
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:22.500
My second dog has never seen anything.

10
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:23.900
Hey, come in, come in

11
00:00:25.966 --> 00:00:28.833
Brother Liang, you said the scourge is coming

12
00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:29.866
You are not afraid

13
00:00:29.866 --> 00:00:31.166
Humph

14
00:00:31.166 --> 00:00:32.200
I didn't blow

15
00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.133
Our dogs are naturally angry and fearless

16
00:00:35.133 --> 00:00:37.066
When I saw that scourge, I had to walk around

17
00:00:37.066 --> 00:00:38.900
Brother, don't worry.

18
00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:40.833
I'm sleeping peacefully.

19
00:00:40.966 --> 00:00:42.200
Can't sleep?

20
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.133
You don't even know when he'll be back

21
00:00:44.133 --> 00:00:47.800
Smoke, I heard the old man in the village say

22
00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.600
This scourge is looking for someone

23
00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:50.733
Pen Spirit knocks on the door

24
00:00:50.733 --> 00:00:52.466
The door knocks three times

25
00:00:52.566 --> 00:00:56.700
Goku, you will listen with your ears pricked up in a while

26
00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:59.766
Doom comes when you hear a knock on the door.

27
00:01:00.933 --> 00:01:02.400
Ah Mr. Liang

28
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:03.633
Coming, coming.

29
00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.800
Who are you

30
00:01:10.133 --> 00:01:11.000
You tease me again

31
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.466
You sneak back into your butt bed and try it

32
00:01:18.666 --> 00:01:21.133
It's not Li Ergou, you're not done, are you?

33
00:01:21.133 --> 00:01:23.200
No, no, it's not me this time

34
00:01:23.466 --> 00:01:25.933
Open the door for my sister on the first day of junior high school

35
00:01:25.933 --> 00:01:26.733
roll

36
00:01:27.066 --> 00:01:29.466
Let's go, my ghost daughter-in-law is coming to the door

37
00:01:29.466 --> 00:01:30.666
You can't last long

38
00:01:30.666 --> 00:01:32.066
Hurry up and think of a way
