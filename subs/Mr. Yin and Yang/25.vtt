Who who who

2
00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:09.400
Boy, help me get a bucket of water

3
00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:11.633
I'm from Yushugou.

4
00:00:11.733 --> 00:00:14.266
I can't move anymore

5
00:00:14.266 --> 00:00:17.466
Ouch, you scared me to death, old lady.

6
00:00:17.966 --> 00:00:19.800
Why are you so old?

7
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.133
He even came out to fetch water by himself

8
00:00:21.133 --> 00:00:25.866
Your son and daughter-in-law are dead

9
00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.400
My family is dead.

10
00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:31.966
Do me a favor.

11
00:00:32.066 --> 00:00:35.466
Hey, sing, then I'll help you fetch water, hey.

12
00:00:35.466 --> 00:00:36.366
Yes, old lady

13
00:00:36.366 --> 00:00:39.533
Do you know where the well in Yushugou is?

14
00:00:39.533 --> 00:00:41.566
know know

15
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.666
One ditch, one well.

16
00:00:44.666 --> 00:00:47.166
The villagers eat water there

17
00:00:47.166 --> 00:00:49.266
We're on our way

18
00:00:49.333 --> 00:00:52.466
Go, I'll take you there, okay?

19
00:00:52.466 --> 00:00:54.500
Hey, old lady, please hold this for me

20
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.600
I'll bring you water, let's go

21
00:01:01.666 --> 00:01:03.466
The old lady is a long time old

22
00:01:03.466 --> 00:01:04.866
How about legs and feet so fast?

23
00:01:11.733 --> 00:01:14.000
Go, grandma

24
00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.333
Why are you only touching the ground on your toes when you walk?

25
00:01:17.333 --> 00:01:18.833
Hahaha

26
00:01:19.333 --> 00:01:25.400
When I was a child, I could only walk with my feet bound and use my toes

27
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.266
You don't think I'm a ghost, do you?

28
00:01:29.266 --> 00:01:32.800
Ah no no no no no let's go

29
00:01:47.933 --> 00:01:52.400
Be careful when you slide by the well
