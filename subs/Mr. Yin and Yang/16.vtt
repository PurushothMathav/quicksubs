00:00:00.533 --> 00:00:01.833
Little brat

2
00:00:01.933 --> 00:00:04.300
Old man, I'm making you passionate

3
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.200
If you really want to live

4
00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:09.633
It depends on whether you are brave enough.

5
00:00:09.866 --> 00:00:12.833
Grandpa, grandpa, what do you want me to do?

6
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.266
I'm going to let them fight the ghosts

7
00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:18.100
Fighting ghosts is right

8
00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:20.500
You find tolerance for that scourge is very fierce

9
00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:21.600
Want to live

10
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.233
You must find a more fierce master than him

11
00:00:24.966 --> 00:00:27.466
Where can I find a more fierce master?

12
00:00:27.466 --> 00:00:28.766
It will be dawn.

13
00:00:28.933 --> 00:00:31.033
You go to the east end of the village to find Li Ergou

14
00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:32.866
No matter what method you use

15
00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:35.100
Be sure to let him follow you to the back mountain

16
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.733
Eat less three kinds of incense

17
00:00:36.733 --> 00:00:38.066
See everyone and lose

18
00:00:38.066 --> 00:00:39.800
Get ready to knock Li Xueyan

19
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Li Ergou is not good enough with his brain

20
00:00:42.133 --> 00:00:43.500
Mouth is so dirty

21
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.566
I'm afraid it will be bad to take him with you.

22
00:00:45.566 --> 00:00:47.166
Make you understand shit

23
00:00:47.566 --> 00:00:50.533
As the old saying goes, if you kill a pig, you don't kill very many pigs.

24
00:00:50.533 --> 00:00:53.200
Those who keep the village do not keep the village with medicine

25
00:00:53.366 --> 00:00:56.500
Every village has such a caretaker

26
00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.866
They were born short.

27
00:00:58.866 --> 00:00:59.766
But

28
00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.966
They can absorb the unknowns of the village like this

29
00:01:02.966 --> 00:01:06.666
Or disaster Li Ergou is the villager

30
00:01:06.666 --> 00:01:10.666
Well, that's right, otherwise he scolded your ghost daughter-in-law

31
00:01:10.666 --> 00:01:13.066
Why did you have a little mold?

32
00:01:13.166 --> 00:01:15.300
I'll wait now.

33
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.966
You take these three sticks of incense and light him after entering the mountain

34
00:01:22.966 --> 00:01:26.300
If he burned two short and one long in front of some grave

35
00:01:26.333 --> 00:01:27.933
Remember whose grave this is

36
00:01:27.933 --> 00:01:29.533
Then come back quickly

37
00:01:29.533 --> 00:01:32.100
Go, go, go, grandpa has such a big idea

38
00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.833
Let me do things too, can't you burn high incense? Go
