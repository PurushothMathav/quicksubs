00:00:00.933 --> 00:00:02.133
You are holding this chicken

2
00:00:02.133 --> 00:00:03.966
Go around your garden three times

3
00:00:03.966 --> 00:00:05.500
Remember not to speak

4
00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:06.600
Can't look back

5
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.766
Can't run, you know?

6
00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:12.033
Otherwise you are helpless, go

7
00:00:14.366 --> 00:00:15.166
Hey, hey, hey.

8
00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:17.100
Hey, smoke

9
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.466
The chicken made by your daughter-in-law is so beautiful

10
00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:21.666
Hey, hey, hey.

11
00:00:21.666 --> 00:00:22.400
Smoking, smoking

12
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.066
Hey, you keep the drumsticks for me

13
00:00:24.066 --> 00:00:25.600
Keep the drumsticks for me, oops

14
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.500
If not, you and I can eat chicken buttocks

15
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:28.900
The chicken butt should also be very replenished.

16
00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:29.400
Smoking

17
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.266
You are such a coward to smoke

18
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:43.433
Little Xianggong

19
00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:45.100
Little Xianggong

20
00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:48.433
Let's talk later

21
00:00:49.266 --> 00:00:51.166
Let's talk later

22
00:00:53.166 --> 00:00:54.666
Little husband, stop turning around

23
00:00:54.666 --> 00:00:57.033
It was recruited with something squeezed at the back of the head

24
00:00:58.666 --> 00:01:00.766
Little husband, stop turning around

25
00:01:00.766 --> 00:01:02.600
It wasn't me who met today

26
00:01:02.733 --> 00:01:04.633
Fake is fake

27
00:01:05.666 --> 00:01:08.600
You bow three times to the door

28
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.600
Put the chicken in

29
00:01:23.766 --> 00:01:25.466
Grandpa, what's going on?

30
00:01:25.466 --> 00:01:27.000
This is to stop the disaster for you.

31
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.200
And that Li Ergou

32
00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.766
I just scolded your scourge lady for a long time

33
00:01:30.766 --> 00:01:33.966
This will also prevent the disaster for you.

34
00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.500
Then I've passed this hurdle

35
00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.233
Hmm, you think beautifully

36
00:01:38.733 --> 00:01:42.000
You usually sleep with your head facing east and your feet facing west

37
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.766
It's upside down tonight, your head is facing west and your feet are facing east

38
00:01:46.766 --> 00:01:49.366
Put this chicken at your feet

39
00:01:49.366 --> 00:01:53.433
Remember, no matter what happens tonight

40
00:01:53.466 --> 00:01:55.766
You don't even wrestle with that scourge
