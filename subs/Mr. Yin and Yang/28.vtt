00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:02.200
old man

2
00:00:02.866 --> 00:00:04.866
How far is it from your house?

3
00:00:06.733 --> 00:00:08.966
It's just a few steps away.

4
00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.166
Aren't you going to the Ding family's ancient house?

5
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.600
Right behind my house

6
00:00:15.066 --> 00:00:17.200
We are on the same road

7
00:00:18.266 --> 00:00:19.533
No no no no no

8
00:00:19.533 --> 00:00:20.900
I'm running out of energy.

9
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.266
Can you take a break?

10
00:00:25.133 --> 00:00:26.366
The rest of the way

11
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.033
I'll pick the old lady

12
00:00:28.333 --> 00:00:30.200
Just follow along.

13
00:00:30.366 --> 00:00:31.800
Will it?

14
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.266
Granny, these two buckets of water are so heavy

15
00:00:34.266 --> 00:00:36.166
I'm a big boy and I can't carry it

16
00:00:36.166 --> 00:00:37.766
Can you do it?

17
00:00:37.766 --> 00:00:41.400
They can dig lines in the fields.

18
00:00:41.666 --> 00:00:43.800
Sturdy and lively

19
00:00:49.133 --> 00:00:50.866
Ah hey

20
00:00:50.866 --> 00:00:52.666
Not an old woman

21
00:00:52.666 --> 00:00:54.066
Take it slow

22
00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.166
Boy dark

23
00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.633
More forks, keep up

24
00:01:06.266 --> 00:01:07.166
Here it comes.

25
00:01:09.866 --> 00:01:11.800
Ah no

26
00:01:11.866 --> 00:01:13.666
That old lady is a long time old.

27
00:01:13.666 --> 00:01:15.033
How can you go so fast?

28
00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:17.833
Uh-huh.

29
00:01:18.066 --> 00:01:20.466
Old lady, why did you turn back?

30
00:01:20.466 --> 00:01:21.766
I scared me

31
00:01:21.766 --> 00:01:23.700
I'm afraid you can't keep up.

32
00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.066
Come back and wait for you
