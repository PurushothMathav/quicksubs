00:00:03.933 --> 00:00:07.633
Grandpa even found the emperor?

2
00:00:07.666 --> 00:00:09.166
He was expected to come

3
00:00:09.366 --> 00:00:11.133
Old man, I'm right here waiting for him

4
00:00:11.133 --> 00:00:12.800
Ouch grandpa

5
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.100
Stop playing this shit

6
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:15.466
Think of a way

7
00:00:15.466 --> 00:00:17.633
Oh, what are you afraid of?

8
00:00:18.133 --> 00:00:20.400
I went to the patriarch's office and asked for two talismans

9
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.366
Exterminate evil and destroy ghosts

10
00:00:22.366 --> 00:00:25.500
It was originally prepared for that pair of ghosts

11
00:00:25.533 --> 00:00:27.500
It happened suddenly today

12
00:00:27.766 --> 00:00:30.966
I had no choice but to use it on Brother Chen

13
00:00:30.966 --> 00:00:32.300
Lingfo

14
00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:33.733
Where is Grandpa's Buddha?

15
00:00:33.733 --> 00:00:35.466
Hurry up and post one for me.

16
00:00:36.466 --> 00:00:38.300
They all say it's a spiritual Buddha

17
00:00:38.733 --> 00:00:40.100
How can you recognize people easily?

18
00:00:40.133 --> 00:00:42.966
Besides, just your three-legged kung fu

19
00:00:42.966 --> 00:00:44.333
I just give you the talisman

20
00:00:44.333 --> 00:00:45.733
Are you not using waste paper?

21
00:00:45.733 --> 00:00:47.000
If you don't give it, don't give it.

22
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.300
Why are you hitting me?

23
00:00:48.666 --> 00:00:50.166
Okay, stop talking nonsense

24
00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:51.466
I'm going to pick me up outside

25
00:00:52.066 --> 00:00:54.400
Let you and the Chen brothers have no entry or exit

26
00:00:54.733 --> 00:00:56.900
You find a place to hide in the house

27
00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.966
If you don't hear me calling you, don't go out and hide

28
00:01:00.533 --> 00:01:02.866
Grandpa, this house is this size

29
00:01:02.866 --> 00:01:04.200
Where am I going to hide?

30
00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.900
Evil does not bow its head, ghosts do not possess

31
00:01:08.733 --> 00:01:10.166
Just hide under the table

32
00:01:10.166 --> 00:01:12.200
Here, under the table

33
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.466
Will this work?

34
00:01:16.533 --> 00:01:18.300
The scourge you provoke is coming

35
00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:21.000
If you don't refer to it, just wait for death. Okay, okay.

36
00:01:22.933 --> 00:01:25.966
Hey, grandpa, you have to come back early.

37
00:01:26.133 --> 00:01:28.000
This grandson talks a lot

38
00:01:28.566 --> 00:01:29.900
I'm begging you.
