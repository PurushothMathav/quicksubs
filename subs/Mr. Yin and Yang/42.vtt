00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:02.100
No, I've done the math.

2
00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:03.533
Today is my day

3
00:00:03.533 --> 00:00:05.166
As soon as the ground is broken, the troops are dispatched.

4
00:00:05.166 --> 00:00:06.400
Ugly food under the stove

5
00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:07.866
Good luck

6
00:00:07.866 --> 00:00:09.000
Mr. Little has a lot of knowledge.

7
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.066
Listen to you

8
00:00:10.966 --> 00:00:11.833
Burial

9
00:00:13.766 --> 00:00:16.500
From 123

10
00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:29.900
This is hell

11
00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:31.900
This slate killed a hundred and eighty catties

12
00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:33.366
Why can't you lift it up?

13
00:00:33.366 --> 00:00:34.600
Ah little sir

14
00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.566
Come and show me that this stone tablet can't fall to the ground

15
00:00:37.566 --> 00:00:41.266
Even the bar is broken. What's the matter? Let me see.

16
00:00:42.733 --> 00:00:43.533
Yes

17
00:00:47.866 --> 00:00:50.000
Sir, is this the Yin Qi Monument?

18
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.033
You are now

19
00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:53.266
Hurry up and find a husband over 9 years old to come in

20
00:00:53.266 --> 00:00:56.066
Hurry up, little sir, what do you want a rooster for?

21
00:00:56.066 --> 00:00:58.166
Prepare my grandpa said

22
00:00:58.166 --> 00:00:59.566
The more yin the dead

23
00:00:59.566 --> 00:01:00.700
The stele gets heavier

24
00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.500
After using the yang-causing plant kidney tablet

25
00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:03.833
To lift

26
00:01:03.866 --> 00:01:05.533
This 9-year-old migrant worker

27
00:01:05.533 --> 00:01:06.466
Yang overlapping

28
00:01:06.566 --> 00:01:09.300
No matter how heavy the yin qi is, the Lord can still hold back

29
00:01:11.966 --> 00:01:13.500
Hey little sir

30
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:14.333
Tool found

31
00:01:14.333 --> 00:01:16.766
This is the oldest foot soaking machine in our village.

32
00:01:16.766 --> 00:01:17.900
12 years

33
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.466
One two one

34
00:01:34.266 --> 00:01:36.633
Why can't Mr. Xiong lift it up?

35
00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.000
I didn't expect there to be such a heavy soil with yin qi

36
00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:42.600
I don't believe it anymore

37
00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:43.666
Chicken town

38
00:01:43.666 --> 00:01:44.866
I came in person
