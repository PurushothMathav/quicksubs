00:00:00.533 --> 00:00:03.300
Little brother, you won't meet

2
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.300
Is there something unclean?

3
00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.133
Unclean stuff

4
00:00:07.133 --> 00:00:08.366
You don't know.

5
00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:10.333
People have died in this well.

6
00:00:10.333 --> 00:00:12.000
Now the second half of the night

7
00:00:12.533 --> 00:00:15.133
The cries of women can always be heard in the well

8
00:00:15.133 --> 00:00:18.566
Well, I know it was a young girl who died

9
00:00:18.566 --> 00:00:21.533
Brother, the one I met just now was an old woman

10
00:00:21.533 --> 00:00:22.700
Are you mistaken?

11
00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:26.466
The scourge is all one skin and ten faces

12
00:00:26.466 --> 00:00:27.866
How can you tell the difference?

13
00:00:28.266 --> 00:00:30.133
Little brother, I advise you.

14
00:00:30.133 --> 00:00:31.466
Just go.

15
00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.633
Leave it alone and do as it should be said

16
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.033
Had to thrill three punches

17
00:00:40.166 --> 00:00:41.466
Put the rice on the well surface

18
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.666
Gone my rice thick ah

19
00:00:47.666 --> 00:00:49.300
Still with the old woman

20
00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.100
Ahhhhh

21
00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.200
Old wife, where have you been just now?

22
00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:06.000
Cold stomach ache

23
00:01:06.533 --> 00:01:09.333
Go to the woods over there

24
00:01:09.333 --> 00:01:11.900
Gee! You scared me to death!

25
00:01:11.966 --> 00:01:14.500
I really thought you were the one

26
00:01:14.666 --> 00:01:16.766
What is it really?

27
00:01:16.766 --> 00:01:17.700
Hey no no no

28
00:01:17.866 --> 00:01:18.966
Is everything okay?

29
00:01:18.966 --> 00:01:19.800
Yes, old lady

30
00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:20.800
Let me tell you something.

31
00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.866
The water in this well is not clean

32
00:01:22.866 --> 00:01:24.000
What if you want to fetch water?

33
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.300
Let's fight by the river

34
00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:27.433
It's okay.

35
00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.666
My family planted a vegetable plot

36
00:01:31.066 --> 00:01:33.400
Pick it back and water it

37
00:01:34.133 --> 00:01:35.966
Trumpet.

38
00:01:35.966 --> 00:01:38.066
The line for watering the vegetable field

39
00:01:38.066 --> 00:01:39.033
Then you wait

40
00:01:42.533 --> 00:01:45.700
Boy it's dark

41
00:01:45.766 --> 00:01:47.900
I have bad eyes

42
00:01:47.966 --> 00:01:52.100
Can you help me send the water back again?

43
00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.433
Okay, give it away to the end

44
00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:58.966
Send Buddha to the West?

45
00:01:58.966 --> 00:02:01.133
I'll send you back later.

46
00:02:01.133 --> 00:02:05.033
Boy, you are so kind
