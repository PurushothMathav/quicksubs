00:00:04.966 --> 00:00:06.700
Why do you feel so shocked?

2
00:00:08.933 --> 00:00:09.733
Hey

3
00:00:10.766 --> 00:00:12.266
Hey Yanyan

4
00:00:12.333 --> 00:00:14.266
You're back again, brat!

5
00:00:14.266 --> 00:00:16.133
Where did I let you go?

6
00:00:16.133 --> 00:00:19.000
Hehe, Taiping Sun Chen's daughter is sick

7
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.866
Please ask me to preside over the funeral

8
00:00:20.866 --> 00:00:22.933
What oops

9
00:00:22.933 --> 00:00:24.066
Produced by Chen girl

10
00:00:24.066 --> 00:00:25.500
Died halfway that day

11
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.000
The Chen family explained that the chest corner could not be lifted on the ground

12
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.866
Several were killed by stonemasons

13
00:00:29.866 --> 00:00:31.300
It's homicide

14
00:00:31.366 --> 00:00:33.166
Mr. Fang De Shili Baxiang

15
00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:35.533
No one dares to borrow your bunch of robbers

16
00:00:35.533 --> 00:00:36.766
You don't want to die

17
00:00:37.166 --> 00:00:39.466
Oh, how can it be so hard as you say?

18
00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.400
Nothing happened.

19
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:42.566
Exactly.

20
00:00:42.566 --> 00:00:44.866
It's the stone tablet that can't be lifted when it falls to the ground.

21
00:00:44.866 --> 00:00:48.100
I move the lotus flower to sit on the bottom of my monument that stone monument

22
00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:49.766
Lift it up steadily

23
00:00:50.733 --> 00:00:53.466
You really want to die, how can I be human?

24
00:00:53.466 --> 00:00:54.766
Prepared by yourself

25
00:00:54.766 --> 00:00:56.833
I am Zheng, aren't I sad?

26
00:00:56.866 --> 00:00:58.300
Grandpa, why are you hitting me?

27
00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.466
I endure my humility and keep the sky safe for three years

28
00:01:01.466 --> 00:01:04.000
I'm the murderer, you don't live for ten days

29
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:06.666
See for yourself

30
00:01:07.333 --> 00:01:09.166
Grandpa, what's wrong with me?

31
00:01:09.166 --> 00:01:11.500
This is causing the body to wait for death

32
00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.733
Grandpa, if I die

33
00:01:13.733 --> 00:01:16.066
Who gave you the death penalty?

34
00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:17.833
Hey okay

35
00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:19.966
To survive

36
00:01:20.266 --> 00:01:22.300
You have to ask for forgiveness from the evil master

37
00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:23.766
Where did you hide him?

38
00:01:24.533 --> 00:01:26.300
Ah, it's the foot of the back mountain.

39
00:01:26.333 --> 00:01:28.866
Grandpa's place is surrounded by water on three sides

40
00:01:28.866 --> 00:01:31.133
It is a typical jade belt ring demon bureau

41
00:01:31.133 --> 00:01:33.433
I must have picked the right place
