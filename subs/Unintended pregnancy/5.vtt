00:00:02.166 --> 00:00:03.400
Stop hugging uncle

2
00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:04.133
Hold for 3 seconds

3
00:00:04.133 --> 00:00:07.866
This hero saves the beauty and hugs it for 5 seconds, and it takes him to see color

4
00:00:07.866 --> 00:00:09.466
Hey, I'm sorry.

5
00:00:09.466 --> 00:00:11.733
The child has just learned idioms to talk nonsense

6
00:00:11.733 --> 00:00:14.066
Don't talk nonsense, Mr. Gu, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

7
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:15.300
How do you drive?

8
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:16.633
Ma'am, are you alright?

9
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:18.900
My horse fan wasn't hurt

10
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.700
But the orange was hurt.

11
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:23.100
Oranges in supermarkets are very expensive.

12
00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.300
How much? I'll pay you.

13
00:00:26.466 --> 00:00:27.533
Not much money

14
00:00:27.533 --> 00:00:31.100
The child is joking about the market price.

15
00:00:31.733 --> 00:00:35.400
I don't know if the market price 30,000 enough

16
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:38.266
Enough. Enough.

17
00:00:42.333 --> 00:00:45.000
Done uncle uncle, I see you are kind

18
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.200
I'll give you two cucumbers for free.

19
00:00:51.333 --> 00:00:52.200
Hey, Mr. Gu

20
00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.333
I also grow oranges in my hometown

21
00:00:54.333 --> 00:00:55.500
As many as you want.

22
00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.300
Just give it at the market price.

23
00:01:01.266 --> 00:01:03.333
Why do you always feel that I have seen this person before?

24
00:01:03.333 --> 00:01:04.266
I've seen it too.

25
00:01:04.266 --> 00:01:05.533
He hangs a calendar with our family

26
00:01:05.533 --> 00:01:08.266
The God of Wealth looks exactly the same

27
00:01:11.866 --> 00:01:12.666
child

28
00:01:13.133 --> 00:01:13.933
Hey

29
00:01:16.466 --> 00:01:18.700
Did someone just come to the house?

30
00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:19.866
It's my dad.

31
00:01:19.866 --> 00:01:21.666
Yes your dad
