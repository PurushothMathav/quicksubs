00:00:02.733 --> 00:00:03.533
Mr. Gu

2
00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:06.533
I can handle my own children's affairs by myself

3
00:00:06.533 --> 00:00:07.700
Don't worry about it.

4
00:00:24.366 --> 00:00:26.400
Yoyo, are you alright?

5
00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.000
What are you fighting?

6
00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:31.100
Hey, what's wrong is the stone.

7
00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:33.433
It was Yoyo who pushed the stone down first

8
00:00:34.066 --> 00:00:36.000
Why did Yoyo push the stone?

9
00:00:36.866 --> 00:00:38.966
Everyone says I don't have a father

10
00:00:40.566 --> 00:00:42.966
What's the matter, my son is right

11
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.933
It's not your fault that Yoyo doesn't have a dad

12
00:00:45.933 --> 00:00:48.700
Remember who will attack you with this sentence in the future.

13
00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:49.866
That's no tutoring

14
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.400
Who doesn't have a tutor?

15
00:00:54.966 --> 00:00:56.766
My son saw Yoyo stealing something

16
00:00:56.766 --> 00:00:57.966
Does he have a driving school?

17
00:00:57.966 --> 00:00:59.000
That is.

18
00:01:00.133 --> 00:01:02.500
Lian Yoyo stole Nian Nian's game console

19
00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.000
Found it in the bag

20
00:01:04.066 --> 00:01:05.266
funeral scourge

21
00:01:05.266 --> 00:01:07.266
Mommy, I didn't steal anything

22
00:01:07.266 --> 00:01:07.900
My child

23
00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:10.500
I know Yoyo would never steal anything
