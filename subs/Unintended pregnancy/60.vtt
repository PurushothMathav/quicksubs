00:00:01.533 --> 00:00:03.200
Mr. Gu, you are looking for me.

2
00:00:03.366 --> 00:00:04.600
From tomorrow.

3
00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:05.800
You don't have to come again.

4
00:00:06.266 --> 00:00:07.666
You want to fire me?

5
00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:09.700
Mr. Gu, why?

6
00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:11.466
You are planning to frame Ling San

7
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:13.466
I really thought I didn't know

8
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:14.300
Mr. Gu

9
00:00:14.866 --> 00:00:16.266
You can't talk nonsense.

10
00:00:16.566 --> 00:00:18.500
When did I frame Secretary Lin?

11
00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:20.433
There must be evidence to speak.

12
00:00:20.466 --> 00:00:21.866
This is at your workstation.

13
00:00:22.266 --> 00:00:23.966
Found Chen Te's mobile phone

14
00:00:24.366 --> 00:00:26.400
I accidentally picked it up.

15
00:00:26.566 --> 00:00:28.200
I haven't had time to return it to Chen Te

16
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:29.233
What's the point?

17
00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:31.200
Chen Tezhu

18
00:00:37.966 --> 00:00:40.800
Mr. Gu, I have old and young

19
00:00:40.966 --> 00:00:42.766
Can't lose this job

20
00:00:43.533 --> 00:00:44.333
Let's go

21
00:00:44.966 --> 00:00:47.233
Mr. Gu, Mr. Gu, I was wrong, Mr. Gu

22
00:00:48.933 --> 00:00:52.066
Madam, please help me plead with Mr. Gu

23
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.733
You know about the company, right?

24
00:00:54.733 --> 00:00:56.166
I never ask

25
00:00:56.333 --> 00:00:58.466
If I want to help you, I will also ask Mingzhu.

26
00:00:59.933 --> 00:01:01.366
But framing the funeral

27
00:01:01.366 --> 00:01:03.400
You asked me to do it for you from the beginning

28
00:01:07.266 --> 00:01:09.900
No third person can know about this

29
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.033
You have been the president's head teacher these years

30
00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:13.600
Did you eat a lot of rebates?

31
00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.466
If you don't want to go to jail

32
00:01:15.666 --> 00:01:17.700
Just give me the volume and close it up

33
00:01:18.766 --> 00:01:20.600
President, this is the DNA report

34
00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:31.766
How could this be?

35
00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:33.966
Stones are really fun
