00:00:01.266 --> 00:00:02.400
Zhang Ting, how are you?

2
00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:03.400
I am Linsa

3
00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:07.400
Zhang Ting

4
00:00:08.266 --> 00:00:09.366
You scum

5
00:00:09.366 --> 00:00:10.833
Where did you hide Zhang Ting?

6
00:00:12.166 --> 00:00:14.900
I didn't expect him to treat you so badly.

7
00:00:15.333 --> 00:00:17.100
You still care so much about his life

8
00:00:17.533 --> 00:00:19.966
No matter how bad he is, he can't be worse than you scumbag

9
00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:21.900
He saved my life when I was a kid

10
00:00:26.566 --> 00:00:27.400
You won't be here by now

11
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.466
You still don't know the truth

12
00:00:30.933 --> 00:00:32.900
He is such a selfish person

13
00:00:33.533 --> 00:00:35.600
Can I risk my life to save you?

14
00:00:36.066 --> 00:00:37.233
What do you mean?

15
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.566
Save me save me

16
00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.333
Isn't this my favorite hairpin?

17
00:00:46.333 --> 00:00:47.500
Help Me

18
00:00:48.566 --> 00:00:49.466
Ah!

19
00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:58.666
Tingting thank you

20
00:00:58.666 --> 00:01:00.966
If it weren't for you, I would have fallen

21
00:01:00.966 --> 00:01:04.500
My arm hurt when I just pulled you.

22
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:05.700
Don't be sad.

23
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.933
Haven't you always liked my hairpin?

24
00:01:07.933 --> 00:01:09.400
Then give it to you.

25
00:01:10.533 --> 00:01:11.333
Ah!

26
00:01:11.866 --> 00:01:13.700
Ok forgive you

27
00:01:22.533 --> 00:01:24.066
So you mean

28
00:01:24.066 --> 00:01:26.266
He didn't try to save me in the first place.

29
00:01:26.333 --> 00:01:28.033
It's for the hairpin on my head

30
00:01:31.766 --> 00:01:33.100
You liar

31
00:01:33.133 --> 00:01:34.600
Why should I believe you?

32
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.566
If he hadn't been showing off to my face

33
00:01:39.666 --> 00:01:41.366
Can I know so much?

34
00:01:42.166 --> 00:01:44.066
In fact, you already believe it

35
00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:45.766
Just dare not admit it

36
00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.233
I want to ask him clearly.

37
00:01:49.533 --> 00:01:50.333
Don't worry.

38
00:01:51.266 --> 00:01:52.500
Between us

39
00:01:53.266 --> 00:01:55.800
There are still many things to do by yourself
