00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:01.666
Am I like this?

2
00:00:01.666 --> 00:00:04.166
Could it be that they have been separated for many years?

3
00:00:05.166 --> 00:00:06.433
Competitiveness?

4
00:00:08.866 --> 00:00:10.466
Good morning, everybody.

5
00:00:11.466 --> 00:00:14.800
I got up at 3 o'clock today and went for a morning run.

6
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:17.533
Long time no see Mr. Gu

7
00:00:17.533 --> 00:00:20.233
Did you sleep well last night?

8
00:00:22.166 --> 00:00:23.266
Not sleeping well

9
00:00:24.366 --> 00:00:26.300
Last night I dreamed of a water snake

10
00:00:27.266 --> 00:00:30.300
I'm tired, you two are not right

11
00:00:32.066 --> 00:00:33.833
Yeah, what's up?

12
00:00:37.733 --> 00:00:41.433
Your lips are both swollen and red

13
00:00:42.566 --> 00:00:43.833
Oh, I see.

14
00:00:45.166 --> 00:00:47.100
You must have been last night

15
00:00:49.266 --> 00:00:51.000
Eating barbecue behind my back

16
00:00:53.766 --> 00:00:56.600
I also asked the chef to go to the barbecue.

17
00:00:58.933 --> 00:00:59.733
Mr. Gu

18
00:00:59.866 --> 00:01:02.466
I'm really sorry, I don't need to say it last night.

19
00:01:02.466 --> 00:01:04.033
I know what's going on.
