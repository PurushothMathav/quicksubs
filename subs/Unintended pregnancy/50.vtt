00:00:02.066 --> 00:00:04.066
Look at you sweating profusely

2
00:00:04.266 --> 00:00:07.200
Dad, do you like my horse fan?

3
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.400
Yo Yo, don't make such a joke

4
00:00:13.566 --> 00:00:15.300
Men understand men best

5
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:16.866
A man doesn't like you

6
00:00:16.866 --> 00:00:18.366
Why spend money on you every day?

7
00:00:18.366 --> 00:00:19.600
Buy you something

8
00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.966
In a hurry to be a father to your son

9
00:00:21.966 --> 00:00:25.200
He doesn't like you, does he like poverty alleviation?

10
00:00:26.466 --> 00:00:28.200
Dad Gu, speak up

11
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.266
A man must be brave

12
00:00:30.266 --> 00:00:32.900
Why don't you dare to admit it if you like it?

13
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.166
Mrs. Lin?

14
00:00:35.166 --> 00:00:37.100
Thank you for the birthday cake you ordered.

15
00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.933
Let's eat cake

16
00:00:37.933 --> 00:00:39.700
Otherwise, this cake won't taste good if it's cold.

17
00:00:39.733 --> 00:00:42.500
Thank you. Today is your birthday

18
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.366
Yes, I happen to be 4 years old today

19
00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:47.400
Then make a wish

20
00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.066
I hope to wake up tomorrow. I'm 18 years old.

21
00:00:51.066 --> 00:00:53.533
But Mommy turned eight.

22
00:00:53.533 --> 00:00:56.866
So it's my turn to protect Mommy

23
00:00:56.966 --> 00:00:58.033
Blow out the candles

24
00:00:59.066 --> 00:00:59.866
Oh.

25
00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.533
Mommy, I'm going to call

26
00:01:02.533 --> 00:01:06.100
Today, the new friends you meet will come to eat cake.

27
00:01:06.133 --> 00:01:06.933
Go ahead.

28
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:09.800
slow long

29
00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:11.866
Yoyo is so sensible

30
00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:14.466
Yoyo has always been an angel baby

31
00:01:14.466 --> 00:01:17.066
I remember when I was pregnant it was very hot in September

32
00:01:17.066 --> 00:01:18.166
Other mothers have morning sickness

33
00:01:18.166 --> 00:01:19.500
Just my appetite is very good

34
00:01:19.666 --> 00:01:22.866
Can eat 2.5 kilograms of watermelon and half a bucket of instant noodles at a time

35
00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:25.166
Yoyo was also pregnant in September 5 years ago

36
00:01:25.566 --> 00:01:27.233
How could there be such a coincidence?
