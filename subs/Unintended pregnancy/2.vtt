00:00:00.533 --> 00:00:02.333
Tingting, why do you owe money again?

2
00:00:02.333 --> 00:00:04.100
Didn't I just call you 3,000?

3
00:00:04.133 --> 00:00:05.966
How is 3,000 enough?

4
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.300
I have to support myself and my son

5
00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:09.933
Then I introduced you to a job last month

6
00:00:09.933 --> 00:00:11.300
Forget about that job

7
00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:13.266
Can you introduce me to the sales job?

8
00:00:13.266 --> 00:00:15.300
Tired to death, not to mention earning less

9
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:17.966
Why don't you just introduce me to a rich man?

10
00:00:18.266 --> 00:00:21.300
Haha, rich man, Aunt Lin, I'm hungry.

11
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:22.566
What's for dinner?

12
00:00:22.866 --> 00:00:23.700
What to eat

13
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.066
Refrigerator leftovers

14
00:00:26.066 --> 00:00:27.900
My mom earns money alone

15
00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.766
But you have to raise four mouths to eat

16
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.400
You can't say that.

17
00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.966
I grew up in an orphanage with your mother

18
00:00:34.966 --> 00:00:36.866
You are the same 4 years old as the stone

19
00:00:36.866 --> 00:00:37.933
What is this called?

20
00:00:37.933 --> 00:00:39.500
This is called fate

21
00:00:39.733 --> 00:00:41.700
Now it's your mother who takes care of me

22
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.400
Wait until Auntie becomes prosperous in the future

23
00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.266
But I got your back.

24
00:00:45.366 --> 00:00:47.700
Aunt Zhang Ting is so good at painting cakes

25
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.000
Why is the stone always hungry?

26
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.566
Say less

27
00:00:52.333 --> 00:00:53.133
Hey

28
00:00:53.666 --> 00:00:55.700
Is this what the man left that night?

29
00:00:55.866 --> 00:00:57.066
Put it down

30
00:00:57.066 --> 00:00:58.200
Looks like it's worth the money.

31
00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:59.166
Bring it to me

32
00:00:59.166 --> 00:01:00.933
This is the only thing his dad left him

33
00:01:00.933 --> 00:01:02.466
People are precious

34
00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.833
Mommy, the supermarket is on sale at 8 o'clock.

35
00:01:08.666 --> 00:01:11.000
Oh go go go go grab eggs

36
00:01:19.666 --> 00:01:23.033
I'll just wear it. What's the matter, cheapskate?

37
00:01:27.733 --> 00:01:29.633
Oops, come on, don't knock

38
00:01:35.733 --> 00:01:36.800
Who are you?

39
00:01:36.933 --> 00:01:41.366
Was it you at the R & F Hotel on September 2nd 5 years ago?
