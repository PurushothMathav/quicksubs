00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:01.400
It's going to kill you.

2
00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:03.200
I'm not eating them.

3
00:00:03.333 --> 00:00:06.366
Ouch my ass son

4
00:00:06.566 --> 00:00:08.233
Mom doesn't want to hit you either

5
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:10.600
Thanks to that Galessia

6
00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:13.833
Don't worry, your mother will definitely avenge you.

7
00:00:17.866 --> 00:00:18.666
Linsa

8
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.500
I'm going to a meeting.

9
00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:21.666
Buy me a breakfast

10
00:00:21.733 --> 00:00:23.966
I'm also preparing to speak at a later meeting

11
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.366
Why don't you go by yourself?

12
00:00:25.366 --> 00:00:26.266
What do you mean?

13
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.866
I am the director of a president's office

14
00:00:28.866 --> 00:00:29.733
I can't call you

15
00:00:29.733 --> 00:00:31.233
No hands or no legs?

16
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.233
Dare to ask my people to buy you breakfast

17
00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:34.600
Hey, Mr. Gu

18
00:00:35.133 --> 00:00:37.000
I'm also teaching Lindsay

19
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.033
Some worldly sophistication in the workplace

20
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:40.900
He bought it for me today

21
00:00:41.133 --> 00:00:42.833
I'll buy it for him tomorrow.

22
00:00:43.133 --> 00:00:44.666
Only with these contacts

23
00:00:44.666 --> 00:00:47.166
Can colleagues be closer?

24
00:00:47.166 --> 00:00:48.133
Is that so?

25
00:00:48.133 --> 00:00:50.800
Director, I ordered you coffee yesterday

26
00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:54.000
Is it your turn to invite me today?

27
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Of course, yeah.

28
00:00:56.166 --> 00:00:57.966
I was waiting to give you some.

29
00:00:57.966 --> 00:01:00.166
Since it is to get closer to colleagues

30
00:01:00.533 --> 00:01:02.100
Everyone should order

31
00:01:02.733 --> 00:01:03.866
Right, Director Ma?

32
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.100
Everyone in the company has a cup

33
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:07.400
I please

34
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.766
No sugar, thank you. No sugar.

35
00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.300
What's going on lately?

36
00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.100
Always offend the company

37
00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:18.166
No way.

38
00:01:18.166 --> 00:01:20.800
I have to go to the temple to pay my respects after a while

39
00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.766
The gods can't take care of you

40
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.500
But I can

41
00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.633
You are

42
00:01:27.866 --> 00:01:29.233
Introduce yourself

43
00:01:29.266 --> 00:01:30.400
My name is Zhang Ting

44
00:01:30.766 --> 00:01:33.100
It's Mr. Gu's trustee
