00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:06.600
Mm, whose is this?

2
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:07.766
Teacher, look

3
00:00:07.866 --> 00:00:09.933
Nian Nian's game console was stolen by Lin Yoyo

4
00:00:09.933 --> 00:00:12.533
I didn't steal it, I've never seen this game console

5
00:00:12.533 --> 00:00:13.600
You're lying.

6
00:00:13.733 --> 00:00:15.866
I saw you put it in your schoolbag at 7am

7
00:00:15.866 --> 00:00:18.466
Why did you just say what you saw this morning?

8
00:00:18.466 --> 00:00:19.533
You just lied

9
00:00:19.533 --> 00:00:21.100
We all have game consoles

10
00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:22.266
You can't afford it.

11
00:00:22.266 --> 00:00:23.700
Not only do you not have a game console

12
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:24.900
No dad yet

13
00:00:26.266 --> 00:00:28.300
Hey uncle hey stone

14
00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:32.400
I heard that Mr. Gu just came back from a business trip to Jinshi

15
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.233
He had a conflict with his wife

16
00:00:34.366 --> 00:00:36.066
Mr. Gu has a wife

17
00:00:36.066 --> 00:00:37.466
Don't you know about this?

18
00:00:37.533 --> 00:00:39.366
My heart is broken

19
00:00:39.366 --> 00:00:40.400
Hey, Secretary Li

20
00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.700
Do you know anything about this?

21
00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:45.866
I don't believe you don't know

22
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.033
What are you pretending to be stupid?

23
00:00:49.133 --> 00:00:50.900
Mr. Gu's front foot is finished with you

24
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.700
The back foot quarrels with the wife

25
00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.066
The problem must be with you.

26
00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.800
I see someone with a tow bottle

27
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.900
Want to climb into Mr. Gu's bed?

28
00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:02.766
Don't be as weird as me

29
00:01:02.766 --> 00:01:03.800
I'll tell you what.

30
00:01:03.866 --> 00:01:06.500
As long as I have thought of seducing Mr. Gu to take the opportunity to rise to the top

31
00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.966
I can't make a fortune in this life

32
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:15.666
Hey, what's up?

33
00:01:15.666 --> 00:01:17.100
Are you Lin Youyou's parents?

34
00:01:17.166 --> 00:01:19.166
Lin Yoyo got into a fight at school today

35
00:01:20.466 --> 00:01:22.100
Yoyo got into a fight with someone else

36
00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:24.033
I'll be right there.

37
00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.966
Chen Dazhu, I'm going to ask for leave to go to the kindergarten

38
00:01:27.966 --> 00:01:29.066
I will accompany you.
