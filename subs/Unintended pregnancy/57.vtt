1
00:00:01.666 --> 00:00:02.566
Explain that to me.

2
00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.900
Yoyo Mingming has always lived with Chen Te

3
00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:06.400
Why did you lie to Secretary Lin?

4
00:00:06.533 --> 00:00:08.200
Said his child was taken away

5
00:00:08.866 --> 00:00:10.566
Oh, I'm wronged.

6
00:00:10.566 --> 00:00:12.733
I did see the back of a child

7
00:00:12.733 --> 00:00:14.433
Just like Yoyo

8
00:00:14.666 --> 00:00:16.366
The same jeans and coat.

9
00:00:16.566 --> 00:00:18.433
Even the hairstyle is the same

10
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.100
I also care about children

11
00:00:21.166 --> 00:00:23.300
In case you are taken away, it is really Yoyo

12
00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.566
I have to say

13
00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.166
No, blowing kisses can't wait at the airport

14
00:00:28.166 --> 00:00:30.100
Secretary Lin is very angry and takes a plane to leave

15
00:00:30.733 --> 00:00:32.466
What? I'll contact him right away.

16
00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:34.466
He blocked me.

17
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.200
Secretary Lin

18
00:00:36.766 --> 00:00:39.233
I know you're nervous kid

19
00:00:39.366 --> 00:00:42.466
But you can't leave Weiwei at the airport, can you?

20
00:00:42.466 --> 00:00:44.333
She's an international supermodel

21
00:00:44.333 --> 00:00:46.366
The opening model for this launch event

22
00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:49.766
Can't come now

23
00:00:49.933 --> 00:00:53.400
The press conference may face an open skylight

24
00:00:53.933 --> 00:00:54.900
This responsibility

25
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.266
Are you worthy?

26
00:00:56.466 --> 00:00:57.266
Mr. Gu

27
00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.866
I am willing to take all the responsibility this time.

28
00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:01.700
Urgently contact the modeling agency

29
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.200
Have them send other supermodels over

30
00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.466
Price is not an issue

31
00:01:04.866 --> 00:01:05.666
Yes

32
00:01:06.533 --> 00:01:08.200
The press conference is about to start.

33
00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.600
It's going to the peak now, it's probably too late.

34
00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.600
Everybody back and forth.

35
00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.300
A project that has been working hard for more than half a year

36
00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:19.600
That's how you replicate Dongliu

37
00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.433
Mr. Gu is better than

38
00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:23.966
Just let me on top
