00:00:01.766 --> 00:00:03.866
Son, remember

2
00:00:04.133 --> 00:00:04.933
today

3
00:00:05.533 --> 00:00:07.800
You are the heir to Story Corporation

4
00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:09.666
Start today.

5
00:00:09.666 --> 00:00:12.266
No one can bully our mother and son anymore

6
00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:18.100
Call everyone over today

7
00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:19.466
I want to announce

8
00:00:19.466 --> 00:00:21.400
The heir to our story group

9
00:00:21.933 --> 00:00:24.000
I would also like to introduce to you

10
00:00:24.166 --> 00:00:26.366
My wife and son.

11
00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.166
Linsalin Yoyo

12
00:00:37.133 --> 00:00:38.400
How could this be?

13
00:00:40.066 --> 00:00:42.533
It's all wrong. It's all wrong.

14
00:00:42.533 --> 00:00:45.766
No, the stone is your son, and you are stubborn

15
00:00:46.366 --> 00:00:47.666
Bring people with you

16
00:00:49.066 --> 00:00:51.033
Take it easy

17
00:00:52.066 --> 00:00:53.233
Let go of me!

18
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.033
Dad?

19
00:00:57.066 --> 00:00:59.433
Know dad

20
00:01:06.066 --> 00:01:08.100
You already found out, didn't you?

21
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.100
You deliberately tricked me into coming here to Zhang Ting

22
00:01:13.066 --> 00:01:14.566
You switch DNA without permission.

23
00:01:14.966 --> 00:01:16.366
embezzlement

24
00:01:16.466 --> 00:01:18.000
Instigating others to commit crimes

25
00:01:18.566 --> 00:01:21.000
The lower body is well in prison

26
00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:24.833
I was wrong.

27
00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:26.200
Li Can

28
00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.533
Li Can, help me beg to marry Li Can

29
00:01:28.533 --> 00:01:30.366
I don't want to go to jail.

30
00:01:31.266 --> 00:01:32.433
You say when you were a child

31
00:01:32.466 --> 00:01:34.100
I saved you when I was a kid

32
00:01:34.566 --> 00:01:36.366
Is it Zhang Ting?

33
00:01:36.966 --> 00:01:39.033
You really want to save me?

34
00:01:41.366 --> 00:01:44.000
Or do you think I'm dead?

35
00:01:44.166 --> 00:01:46.400
The hairpin on my head is yours

36
00:01:49.566 --> 00:01:50.366
Sasa

37
00:01:50.933 --> 00:01:53.200
We have been friends for so many years

38
00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:54.466
And you know

39
00:01:54.466 --> 00:01:57.266
I do it all for the stone

40
00:01:57.333 --> 00:01:58.966
Everyone is a mother

41
00:01:59.066 --> 00:02:00.966
You will understand my stone

42
00:02:02.766 --> 00:02:04.633
I think you are all for yourself

43
00:02:05.166 --> 00:02:06.833
If you really do it for the children

44
00:02:07.066 --> 00:02:08.900
You'll let him have a criminal mother

45
00:02:09.566 --> 00:02:11.800
You are selfish

46
00:02:12.466 --> 00:02:15.600
Yes, you stole my hairpin when you were a child

47
00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.433
When I grew up, I stole my identity

48
00:02:22.666 --> 00:02:23.633
rob you

49
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
Is it wrong for me to rob you?

50
00:02:29.566 --> 00:02:31.400
Obviously everyone is pregnant out of wedlock

51
00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.866
Why are you pregnant with a rich man's child?

52
00:02:34.866 --> 00:02:37.500
I'm carrying the seed of the poor.
