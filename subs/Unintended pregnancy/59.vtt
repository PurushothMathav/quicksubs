00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:02.100
I'd like to see how you act

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.633
I'm not a supermodel.

3
00:00:05.733 --> 00:00:09.000
I'm a single mom to a four-year-old.

4
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.833
An ordinary person in the workplace

5
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:12.966
My body is not perfect

6
00:00:12.966 --> 00:00:15.900
But I know I am beautiful today

7
00:00:16.066 --> 00:00:18.100
Because that's what the best design is.

8
00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:19.666
Not perfect for the sake of perfection

9
00:00:19.666 --> 00:00:22.866
It's about making ordinary perfect. Well said

10
00:00:30.133 --> 00:00:31.700
You unlost trash

11
00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:34.066
I let you get rid of the discrepancy

12
00:00:34.066 --> 00:00:34.766
You can do it

13
00:00:34.766 --> 00:00:36.600
Instead, let him rush into the limelight

14
00:00:37.166 --> 00:00:39.166
I underestimated this woman before

15
00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:40.566
But next time

16
00:00:40.566 --> 00:00:42.666
Definitely not so lucky

17
00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.500
Miss Lin, introduce yourself

18
00:00:46.566 --> 00:00:48.366
I'm Wei Ming from Satellite TV Group.

19
00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.900
I don't know if we can have a meal together tomorrow

20
00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:51.400
Ah!

21
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.400
Is the talent shortage in my satellite TV group so serious?

22
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.966
Mr. Wei actually wants to be a headhunter himself

23
00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.066
Thank you, President Wei

24
00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.666
But I have no plans to change jobs just yet.

25
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.133
Miss Lin misunderstood

26
00:01:03.133 --> 00:01:04.500
It has nothing to do with work

27
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.000
I want to ask you out personally

28
00:01:08.266 --> 00:01:10.766
My mom is free all day

29
00:01:10.766 --> 00:01:13.500
Uncle's little cakes are especially delicious

30
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.433
Why don't you eat and talk?

31
00:01:16.366 --> 00:01:18.100
Ah me me

32
00:01:19.466 --> 00:01:21.400
What's wrong with this Lin Yoyo?

33
00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:22.966
Yesterday you called me dad

34
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.466
I'll be a thief today

35
00:01:24.566 --> 00:01:25.433
And this

36
00:01:25.666 --> 00:01:26.833
I didn't say it every day before

37
00:01:26.866 --> 00:01:28.666
Don't consider getting married before the age of 30

38
00:01:28.666 --> 00:01:31.600
Why are you thinking about chasing women now that you are only 29?

39
00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.266
Mr. Hu, are you jealous?

40
00:01:33.266 --> 00:01:35.000
Joke me how could it be

41
00:01:35.166 --> 00:01:38.666
I also think that even if you like me, you are not qualified.

42
00:01:39.666 --> 00:01:41.300
The DNA thing is figured out

43
00:01:41.366 --> 00:01:43.000
No results tomorrow night

44
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.400
You don't have to work anymore
