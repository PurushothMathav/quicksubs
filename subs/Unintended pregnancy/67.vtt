00:00:03.766 --> 00:00:04.566
madam

2
00:00:05.366 --> 00:00:07.700
Mr. Gu, Mr. Gu hasn't come back yet

3
00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:09.566
He said he was eating out with someone

4
00:00:10.066 --> 00:00:11.433
That bitch again

5
00:00:12.666 --> 00:00:14.200
You?

6
00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:16.266
What are you still doing?

7
00:00:16.266 --> 00:00:17.400
Pack up

8
00:00:22.766 --> 00:00:25.500
Madam, this is the new worker

9
00:00:25.966 --> 00:00:27.033
Yes, ma'am.

10
00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:31.100
madam

11
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.066
There you are.

12
00:00:48.066 --> 00:00:49.800
Take the money and get out

13
00:00:55.866 --> 00:00:57.000
That's all.

14
00:00:57.933 --> 00:00:59.400
What about the beggar?

15
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.400
Well, how much do you want?

16
00:01:05.866 --> 00:01:07.966
You can say whatever you want.

17
00:01:08.566 --> 00:01:10.766
Three or five hundred thousand first, I bah

18
00:01:11.333 --> 00:01:13.266
You really came with your mouth open?

19
00:01:13.266 --> 00:01:14.666
I don't have that kind of money.

20
00:01:15.933 --> 00:01:19.433
My own son calls others dad outside

21
00:01:19.966 --> 00:01:22.366
You can't give me a mental damage fee.

22
00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.033
You can't give it.

23
00:01:26.933 --> 00:01:28.600
I'm looking for Gu Sheng

24
00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.866
I just don't know that he is a dignified story president

25
00:01:33.866 --> 00:01:37.033
Do you know that you are a green turtle outside?

26
00:01:37.366 --> 00:01:39.066
Ask someone for a son

27
00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.033
Well, as long as you don't show up again

28
00:01:44.133 --> 00:01:45.166
How much do you want?

29
00:01:45.533 --> 00:01:46.833
I'll give it all to you.

30
00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.100
Hmm cheers
