00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:03.000
I'm on my way to the airport.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:03.900
Yoyo is gone

4
00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:06.433
What Yoyo was taken away

5
00:00:08.266 --> 00:00:10.966
The user you dialed is temporarily unavailable

6
00:00:10.966 --> 00:00:12.700
Why doesn't this Chen Tezhu answer the phone?

7
00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:14.766
The master immediately turned around

8
00:00:15.966 --> 00:00:18.133
Don't worry, I've already sent people from the Gong Sanbao department

00:00:18.133 --> 00:00:18.933
It's all pumped out

10
00:00:18.933 --> 00:00:20.566
I believe there will be news soon.

11
00:00:20.566 --> 00:00:22.900
No, I can't just wait and see.

12
00:00:24.066 --> 00:00:26.133
Hello, have you seen this child?

13
00:00:26.133 --> 00:00:26.933
Nope.

14
00:00:27.333 --> 00:00:28.533
Have you ever seen a child?

15
00:00:28.533 --> 00:00:29.166
About this high.

16
00:00:29.166 --> 00:00:30.300
Medium and long hair so high

17
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.333
Hair is like this

18
00:00:31.333 --> 00:00:32.600
Have you seen it?

19
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.266
The photo looks like this, you can see it.

20
00:00:35.333 --> 00:00:37.066
I didn't see it, thank you.

21
00:00:40.166 --> 00:00:41.466
Did you find Yoyo?

22
00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:44.633
Why are there so many people?

23
00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:50.966
Yoyo, where have you been?

24
00:00:50.966 --> 00:00:51.666
You scared me to death!

25
00:00:51.666 --> 00:00:53.900
Do you know where you took Yoyo to?

26
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.600
We have been at the children's playground next to us.

27
00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:57.400
I told Secretary Lin

28
00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.100
Then why didn't you answer my call?

29
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.766
Uncle Chen lost his phone

30
00:01:00.766 --> 00:01:03.000
I paid for the ice cream
