00:00:01.366 --> 00:00:03.100
Stone saw his father for the first time as he grew up

2
00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:03.933
A little excited

3
00:00:03.933 --> 00:00:05.900
The scumbag who pretended to be rich back then

4
00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:07.666
Cheating money and deceiving sex still dare to appear

5
00:00:07.666 --> 00:00:08.566
Where is he?

6
00:00:08.566 --> 00:00:11.066
I smashed his head, he left early

7
00:00:11.066 --> 00:00:13.866
He said he had changed and his business had picked up

8
00:00:13.866 --> 00:00:15.300
I want to take our mother and son back

9
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:17.700
Zhang Ting, do you really believe it?

10
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:19.100
You were deceived so badly by him last time.

11
00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:20.200
You've been fooled for the second time

12
00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:20.966
What do you mean?

13
00:00:20.966 --> 00:00:23.500
Linza, can't you see me?

14
00:00:23.566 --> 00:00:25.700
Do you think I'll never deserve a good life?

15
00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:27.433
You always have to be rescued, right?

16
00:00:27.533 --> 00:00:28.733
Why do you think of me so much?

17
00:00:28.733 --> 00:00:30.300
I care about you

18
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.500
Don't you care

19
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:32.766
Go son

20
00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:37.866
Don't go

21
00:00:40.266 --> 00:00:42.300
Why is Auntie Zhang Ting?

22
00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.766
Through memory

23
00:00:43.766 --> 00:00:46.000
You've been borrowing money from my mother

24
00:00:47.266 --> 00:00:50.300
A total of 23,80010 yuan come on

25
00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.566
Okay, pay it back

26
00:00:56.366 --> 00:00:57.833
WeChat transferred to you?

27
00:00:57.866 --> 00:01:00.933
From today onwards, we don't owe each other.

28
00:01:00.933 --> 00:01:02.166
Don't contact.

29
00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.733
Mom, do you really want to break up with Aunt Lin?

30
00:01:10.733 --> 00:01:12.266
Son, remember

31
00:01:12.266 --> 00:01:14.500
Only he has completely disappeared from our lives

32
00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:15.666
Is the safest for us

33
00:01:15.666 --> 00:01:19.300
Hmm, I don't have to live in this shitty place anymore

34
00:01:20.266 --> 00:01:21.000
Mr. Gu

35
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.433
These three are the candidates for the interview for the president's secretary

36
00:01:28.733 --> 00:01:29.600
That's him!
