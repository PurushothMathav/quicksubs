00:00:00.733 --> 00:00:03.566
Madam, why are you still cooking by yourself?

2
00:00:03.666 --> 00:00:05.900
Isn't this the first time you meet your grandson?

3
00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:07.466
I have to show my hands

4
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:11.933
Hey fifth mother

5
00:00:11.933 --> 00:00:13.966
Go and help me get the fish

6
00:00:15.066 --> 00:00:18.200
Why haven't they come back yet?

7
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:23.500
Hey, are you the new babysitter?

8
00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:24.766
Help my mom carry things

9
00:00:24.766 --> 00:00:26.033
Don't you have eyes?

10
00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.200
Take it carefully

11
00:00:31.566 --> 00:00:32.733
Everything is expensive

12
00:00:32.733 --> 00:00:34.266
If it is broken, it will be deducted from your salary.

13
00:00:34.533 --> 00:00:36.566
Who allowed you to talk to my mother like that?

14
00:00:41.866 --> 00:00:43.933
I thought he was the new nanny in the house

15
00:00:43.933 --> 00:00:46.000
Is that the right attitude towards a nanny?

16
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.666
We don't have this rule at home

17
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:53.200
Mom

18
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:55.666
These two people?

19
00:00:55.666 --> 00:00:57.166
I don't like any of them.

20
00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.166
It's better to meet the mother and son today

21
00:01:00.766 --> 00:01:04.766
What are they called? Lin Sa and Lin Yoyo

22
00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:06.966
It's so cute.
