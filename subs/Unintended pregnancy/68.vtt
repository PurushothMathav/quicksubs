1
00:00:00.733 --> 00:00:02.266
Invite me to a stage play

2
00:00:03.733 --> 00:00:04.666
Just the two of us

3
00:00:06.766 --> 00:00:09.166
This is the world's top art troupe

4
00:00:09.166 --> 00:00:10.500
Annual performance

5
00:00:10.733 --> 00:00:11.933
There was originally a special Chen

6
00:00:11.933 --> 00:00:14.066
But he recently had hemorrhoid surgery

7
00:00:14.066 --> 00:00:15.366
I can't do it, I can only lie on my stomach

8
00:00:15.366 --> 00:00:17.233
So it's fine.

9
00:00:18.266 --> 00:00:20.066
I'll give you some leisure and resell it.

10
00:00:20.466 --> 00:00:22.266
Wait a minute, resell

11
00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.266
Yeah, don't you want to go?

12
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.933
I specially booked the venue

13
00:00:25.933 --> 00:00:27.700
Look at this thing

14
00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.100
I thought this thing wouldn't sell

15
00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:31.900
Everyone is booked, but don't worry.

16
00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:33.466
I'll definitely sell you a good price

17
00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:36.066
Go out first

18
00:00:39.733 --> 00:00:40.766
Hey Chen Tezhu

19
00:00:40.866 --> 00:00:42.400
I heard you had hemorrhoid surgery

20
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:43.366
Can't do it

21
00:00:43.366 --> 00:00:43.966
Yeah.

22
00:00:43.966 --> 00:00:46.400
I'll buy you a pillow pad under your butt later.

23
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.000
Mr. Gu, in order to chase Secretary Lin

24
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.066
It's okay to pour dirty water on me

25
00:00:56.266 --> 00:00:58.900
But you invited Secretary Lin to watch the stage play

26
00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:01.233
Why don't you just ask him to sleep?

27
00:01:01.933 --> 00:01:03.466
I mean, Mr. Gu

28
00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:06.666
You can't just think about what you like when you chase people.

29
00:01:06.666 --> 00:01:08.433
Think about what people like

30
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.166
When I was chasing my wife

31
00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.366
Moments from seven years ago

32
00:01:13.366 --> 00:01:14.833
As the saying goes, know yourself and know your enemy.

33
00:01:15.166 --> 00:01:17.166
Is it necessary?

34
00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:18.866
My wife was very moved

35
00:01:18.866 --> 00:01:21.466
Hugged me and kissed me

36
00:01:24.333 --> 00:01:25.700
You talk too much today.

37
00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.166
Go out

38
00:01:27.666 --> 00:01:28.766
Ok Mr. Gu

39
00:01:42.066 --> 00:01:42.866
Zhang Ting

40
00:01:43.366 --> 00:01:44.800
He actually knew Linza
