00:00:00.666 --> 00:00:01.700
Do you have children?

2
00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:03.400
Yes, or else.

3
00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:05.400
Why do you think I chose you as my secretary?

4
00:00:07.333 --> 00:00:09.466
Because your son is the same age as mine.

5
00:00:09.466 --> 00:00:11.633
Can handle a lot of children's problems

6
00:00:12.666 --> 00:00:13.833
same age

7
00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:15.666
That is to say

8
00:00:15.666 --> 00:00:17.900
He didn't just have a wife when he had a one-night stand with me

9
00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:19.033
Wife is still pregnant

10
00:00:20.333 --> 00:00:22.066
Ouch, what's the matter with you?

11
00:00:22.066 --> 00:00:25.066
I'm sorry, Mr. Gu, I've been working overtime these days

12
00:00:25.066 --> 00:00:26.033
hand shake

13
00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:31.033
It's the scum of your bad luck

14
00:00:33.066 --> 00:00:34.566
Chen Dezhu

15
00:00:34.566 --> 00:00:37.600
Has Secretary Li worked a lot of overtime recently?

16
00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:39.366
Then let him work less overtime

17
00:00:39.366 --> 00:00:40.800
If there are not enough people, recruit them.

18
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.633
Don't squeeze sexy yeah

19
00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.766
That beast not only cheated, but also had illegitimate children

20
00:00:46.766 --> 00:00:48.366
I cursed him to death

21
00:00:48.566 --> 00:00:51.466
Bastard must never let my child

22
00:00:51.466 --> 00:00:53.166
Become this disgraceful existence

23
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:54.300
Here comes the president

24
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.133
Here comes the fat man

25
00:00:55.133 --> 00:00:56.566
Help me choose a Children's Day gift.

26
00:00:56.566 --> 00:00:57.766
I want to give it to my son.

27
00:00:58.166 --> 00:00:59.900
Mr. Gu, I'm not good at picking gifts

28
00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:01.266
You'd better change it to someone else.

29
00:01:02.266 --> 00:01:03.833
Would anyone like to help me choose a gift?

30
00:01:03.866 --> 00:01:05.066
5,000 an hour.

31
00:01:05.366 --> 00:01:06.866
I have 5,000 an hour.

32
00:01:06.866 --> 00:01:08.800
Mr. Gu, I am willing to face difficulties

33
00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:10.966
Hmm, annoying

34
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.500
But that hate returns hate

35
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.000
Money is money
