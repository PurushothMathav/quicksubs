00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.033
I was actually a few days ago

2
00:00:04.566 --> 00:00:06.400
Meet Yoyo's dad

3
00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:11.266
And?

4
00:00:11.466 --> 00:00:13.733
But I'm not going to let them meet yet

5
00:00:13.733 --> 00:00:15.800
Yeah, tell me

6
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.333
You had to give birth

7
00:00:17.333 --> 00:00:18.533
I don't know.

8
00:00:18.533 --> 00:00:22.033
Now that Yoyo is so old, can you still recognize him?

9
00:00:23.766 --> 00:00:27.133
Did you solve Yoyo's kindergarten problem?

10
00:00:27.133 --> 00:00:28.600
I'm still trying to figure it out

11
00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.866
Sasa Yoyo is already 4 years old

12
00:00:30.866 --> 00:00:32.566
You haven't settled down yet.

13
00:00:32.566 --> 00:00:35.200
That kid's going to school, he's going to have a problem sooner or later

14
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.366
Want me to say

15
00:00:37.266 --> 00:00:38.466
You should go back home

16
00:00:38.466 --> 00:00:40.466
Back home, right?

17
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.466
Look, my hometown is developing so well now

18
00:00:43.466 --> 00:00:45.466
Your story group job

19
00:00:45.466 --> 00:00:47.233
He is but

20
00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.400
I didn't give my children a good education either.

21
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:50.300
environment is important

22
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.666
We can't delay our children because of ourselves

23
00:00:53.666 --> 00:00:55.266
Right? Mmm.

24
00:00:56.866 --> 00:00:57.900
I think again

25
00:00:58.300 --> 00:00:59.766
If you go back to your hometown

26
00:00:59.766 --> 00:01:02.800
I quoted you for your ticket.
