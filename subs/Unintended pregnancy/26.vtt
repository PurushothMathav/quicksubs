00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.900
Wow, it's a fairy.

2
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:16.900
You are not my mommy, you are the princess

3
00:00:23.066 --> 00:00:26.266
Auntie, why is your whole body glowing?

4
00:00:26.266 --> 00:00:28.466
Rongrong, you say each set looks good.

5
00:00:28.933 --> 00:00:32.166
Mr. Gu, which set do you think I should wear?

6
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:36.200
I generally only make choices for businesses with a few hundred million

7
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:37.800
What do you mean?

8
00:00:38.766 --> 00:00:39.666
Everyone wants it

9
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:40.866
Ok Mr. Gu

10
00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:43.200
A total of 126,888

11
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.500
Mr. Gu, how dare you?

12
00:00:47.533 --> 00:00:48.866
Wear it like this from now on

13
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.266
Finally a little bit like a secretary

14
00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.100
I will translate it for Mr. Gu. It is Mommy, you are beautiful.

15
00:00:58.133 --> 00:01:00.700
Uncle President, we don't take your things for free.

16
00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:03.000
I have something for you too

17
00:01:03.166 --> 00:01:04.066
What's that?

18
00:01:04.133 --> 00:01:07.533
Hahaha mommy said

19
00:01:07.533 --> 00:01:11.200
My smile is the most precious thing in the world

20
00:01:13.666 --> 00:01:14.400
Mr. Gu

21
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.900
What time is our flight to Beijing today?

22
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.400
Hey ma'am

23
00:01:18.666 --> 00:01:19.866
Don't tell the young master

24
00:01:19.866 --> 00:01:22.166
It's not appropriate to fly directly to find him

25
00:01:22.166 --> 00:01:23.266
He is on a temporary business trip

26
00:01:23.266 --> 00:01:24.466
Need my care the most

27
00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:25.433
What's wrong?
