00:00:08.866 --> 00:00:12.333
Uncle Yoyo Gu, have you seen my horse fan?

2
00:00:12.333 --> 00:00:14.633
Why didn't he come back all night?

3
00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:16.300
Your mommy

4
00:00:17.266 --> 00:00:19.366
He must have gone for a morning run

5
00:00:19.666 --> 00:00:21.866
Are you hungry? Uncle will take you to eat delicious food.

6
00:00:21.866 --> 00:00:23.300
Can you eat anything?

7
00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:24.166
You can eat anything.

8
00:00:24.166 --> 00:00:26.966
Then I want to eat Malatang

9
00:00:42.333 --> 00:00:43.466
I'm sorry, Mr. Gu

10
00:00:43.466 --> 00:00:45.300
There is no Malatang in our hotel.

11
00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:49.566
Can you have it now?

12
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.200
We will arrange it for you immediately.

13
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.200
It's the Tokyo version of fish balls.

14
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.866
King crab, crab sticks made of crab meat

15
00:01:02.866 --> 00:01:04.866
The spicy soup base is all abalone and sea cucumber

16
00:01:04.866 --> 00:01:05.533
Drowning in fishing

17
00:01:05.533 --> 00:01:06.433
Its difficult to use

18
00:01:07.366 --> 00:01:08.433
Try it.

19
00:01:12.133 --> 00:01:14.666
This is the best Malatang I've ever had

20
00:01:21.566 --> 00:01:22.266
Uncle Guo

21
00:01:22.266 --> 00:01:25.200
You also like white sugar and vinegar bowls when you eat Malatang

22
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.900
I have lived most of my life

23
00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.900
I've never seen anyone with the same taste as me
