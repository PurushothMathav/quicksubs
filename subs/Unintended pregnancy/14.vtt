00:00:01.366 --> 00:00:03.400
I know you're still mad at Stone

2
00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:05.100
I have educated him

3
00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:06.500
Poor kid too.

4
00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:08.466
I grew up without my father

5
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:10.300
I pulled him up by myself

6
00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:11.866
It's a recipe for neglect.

7
00:00:11.866 --> 00:00:15.033
He already knew he was wrong, right?

8
00:00:15.766 --> 00:00:17.466
He went to the garden himself today

9
00:00:17.466 --> 00:00:18.366
Picked lilies for you

10
00:00:18.366 --> 00:00:19.166
Come over here

11
00:00:20.133 --> 00:00:21.566
Aunt

12
00:00:22.133 --> 00:00:24.700
Hey, ma'am, the young master is allergic to lilies

13
00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:25.966
Take it away

14
00:00:26.333 --> 00:00:27.400
Are you all right?

15
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.700
It's okay, it's okay, Mom Wu, I heard others say it

16
00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:32.733
This pollen allergy is highly genetic

17
00:00:32.733 --> 00:00:34.266
Master Tongue picked the flowers himself

18
00:00:34.266 --> 00:00:35.900
Is he not allergic?

19
00:00:37.766 --> 00:00:40.000
This child has been in good health since he was a child

20
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.366
Maybe follow me

21
00:00:41.466 --> 00:00:42.733
Are you exhausted?

22
00:00:42.733 --> 00:00:44.300
I'll go get you a bath water.

23
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.300
No, I've got work to do.

24
00:00:47.266 --> 00:00:49.400
I know you are busy with work

25
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:50.900
This Friday is Children's Day.

26
00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:52.633
Can you accompany your son

27
00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:57.700
Hey

28
00:00:59.333 --> 00:01:00.400
Come on.

29
00:01:03.766 --> 00:01:06.466
Mommy, why are you so absent-minded?

30
00:01:06.533 --> 00:01:07.400
Ah!

31
00:01:08.266 --> 00:01:09.433
Yoyo

32
00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:11.666
Mom is asking you?

33
00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.166
If you were given a chance to recognize your father

34
00:01:14.366 --> 00:01:15.300
Do you want to admit it?

35
00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:16.266
Of course I recognize it.

36
00:01:16.266 --> 00:01:17.800
How nice to have a father

37
00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.333
Wang Xiaoming said his father would fight

38
00:01:20.333 --> 00:01:23.800
Whoever dares to bully Wang Xiaoming's father will protect him

39
00:01:26.266 --> 00:01:27.066
Mr. Gu

40
00:01:28.133 --> 00:01:31.100
What's wrong? Do you like kids?

41
00:01:31.333 --> 00:01:32.166
like

42
00:01:32.866 --> 00:01:35.400
Oh yeah, I was about to tell you about this.

43
00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.900
You make time for me on Friday

44
00:01:37.933 --> 00:01:39.700
I want to spend Children's Day with my son

45
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.466
Do you have children?
