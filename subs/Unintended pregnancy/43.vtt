00:00:00.466 --> 00:00:02.933
Liu Xiaodong, my son has seen it with his own eyes

2
00:00:02.933 --> 00:00:04.200
He stole something

3
00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.500
Do you think my son would lie and accuse others?

4
00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:06.900
Hey

5
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:09.233
That's not what I meant. What do you mean?

6
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:10.900
Liu Xiaodong

7
00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.800
How much does my husband donate to the kindergarten every year?

8
00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:16.500
I don't need to remind you

9
00:00:16.566 --> 00:00:18.600
I suggest you think about it

10
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.233
How to handle this fairly

11
00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:22.200
Ah.

12
00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.033
Before the results come in

13
00:00:25.066 --> 00:00:28.300
Lin Youyou will suspend school and go home to wait for the result.

14
00:00:30.466 --> 00:00:32.133
Why let Yoyo suspend school first?

15
00:00:32.133 --> 00:00:34.900
I don't think you care about the truth at all

16
00:00:35.066 --> 00:00:38.066
Relying on money and power to determine who is innocent

17
00:00:38.266 --> 00:00:40.833
Is this the aristocratic education that Guixiao claims to be?

18
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.500
Haha, this person is different from others.

19
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.266
Yoyo understands this at such a young age

20
00:00:46.266 --> 00:00:47.833
You should thank me.

21
00:00:50.266 --> 00:00:51.466
Go son

22
00:00:54.933 --> 00:00:55.933
Ms. Lee?

23
00:00:55.933 --> 00:00:56.733
I advise you.

24
00:00:56.733 --> 00:00:58.766
Don't be a hard stone father

25
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.366
You can't afford to be offended.

26
00:01:00.766 --> 00:01:02.966
I'm born with a bad temper

27
00:01:02.966 --> 00:01:04.333
Who told me I can't afford to offend

28
00:01:04.333 --> 00:01:05.600
I would say

29
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.166
I'd like to see who he is
