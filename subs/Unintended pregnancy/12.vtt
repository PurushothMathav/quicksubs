00:00:02.166 --> 00:00:03.533
Where is the ring? Why are you asking me?

2
00:00:03.533 --> 00:00:05.100
It must have been lost by your son.

3
00:00:05.766 --> 00:00:06.600
Who?

4
00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:10.066
Me, a friend.

5
00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:11.266
Bought a new ring

6
00:00:11.266 --> 00:00:12.866
It's always a mistake.

7
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:19.200
Hey

8
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.866
Yoyo Mommy, why do you dress so casually for work?

9
00:00:22.866 --> 00:00:23.500
You are like this

10
00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:26.366
When can I attract the attention of the president's uncle?

11
00:00:26.366 --> 00:00:27.933
Let him be my father

12
00:00:27.933 --> 00:00:30.866
Mommy, I want to rely on my strength and not take shortcuts.

13
00:00:30.966 --> 00:00:33.800
Otherwise, Mommy will take you down in minutes with her face

14
00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:34.600
Uncle Gu

15
00:00:36.566 --> 00:00:38.066
Taking shortcuts also requires capital

16
00:00:38.066 --> 00:00:40.666
It's not a matter of minutes with your face

17
00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:46.900
Don't I have capital?

18
00:00:46.933 --> 00:00:48.800
I'm a capitalist, okay?

19
00:00:49.066 --> 00:00:51.066
Sexy young woman still has charm

20
00:00:51.066 --> 00:00:52.200
After giving birth

21
00:00:52.533 --> 00:00:54.400
Get off work.

22
00:00:55.266 --> 00:00:56.400
Did I let you go?

23
00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.366
Ah, Mr. Gu drank too much

24
00:00:58.366 --> 00:01:00.766
I will exit the blockade and you will continue

25
00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.866
Ok ok no problem

26
00:01:06.166 --> 00:01:07.733
suffer in pain

27
00:01:07.733 --> 00:01:10.100
serve others

28
00:01:15.566 --> 00:01:17.666
Mr. Gu, I will send you back

29
00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.233
Why don't you drink some water first and wake up?

30
00:01:24.466 --> 00:01:25.833
Not good.

31
00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:29.600
Mr. Gu, I was really careless

32
00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:30.666
I'll wipe it for you.

33
00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.566
I didn't mean to. What are you talking about?

34
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.466
Ah, Mr. Gu

35
00:01:36.666 --> 00:01:39.366
If I say I'm not trying to take shortcuts

36
00:01:40.366 --> 00:01:41.366
Do you believe it?
