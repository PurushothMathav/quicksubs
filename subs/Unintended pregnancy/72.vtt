00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:02.833
I said long ago that he worships money masters

2
00:00:04.333 --> 00:00:05.666
You have to believe me.

3
00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:09.700
Actually, you can look at me

4
00:00:11.333 --> 00:00:13.766
I really like you

5
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.833
If he worships money, even he is just right

6
00:00:20.266 --> 00:00:21.833
Anyway, no one is richer than me

7
00:00:22.266 --> 00:00:24.000
I have a better chance of winning than his ex-husband

8
00:00:24.366 --> 00:00:26.666
You're crazy. I'm going to find him

9
00:00:31.666 --> 00:00:35.266
You go up and see something better

10
00:00:41.366 --> 00:00:42.433
Call 120 for me.

11
00:00:42.466 --> 00:00:43.400
Is a scumbag

12
00:00:43.666 --> 00:00:44.866
How dare I hurt you?

13
00:00:45.566 --> 00:00:47.300
Don't be afraid, I'm here

14
00:00:47.966 --> 00:00:49.000
Is that hurt?

15
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.300
What are you talking about?

16
00:00:50.666 --> 00:00:52.400
120 is not for me

17
00:00:52.666 --> 00:00:54.366
Call him. Call him

18
00:00:54.366 --> 00:00:55.233
Hey

19
00:00:55.766 --> 00:00:56.766
Hey

20
00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:04.400
It was you

21
00:01:04.966 --> 00:01:07.000
Of course, after all, I am single and have a baby.

22
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.366
But I had time to walk before

23
00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.100
But why are you here?

24
00:01:13.066 --> 00:01:15.066
I see you try your best with your ex

25
00:01:15.066 --> 00:01:16.266
I can't help but feel that I

26
00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:17.700
So I went with him.

27
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.500
So sad I think

28
00:01:21.966 --> 00:01:23.500
No wait a minute

29
00:01:23.666 --> 00:01:25.566
He's not my ex-husband. What?
