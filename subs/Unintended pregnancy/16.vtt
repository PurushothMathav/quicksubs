00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.400
Hello Mr. Gu

2
00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:03.633
I strolled around for over three hours.

3
00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:06.200
A car model was carefully selected

4
00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:07.666
Just a little expensive

5
00:00:07.666 --> 00:00:11.066
It costs 99,800 each, a red one and a blue one.

6
00:00:11.066 --> 00:00:12.600
See which color your son likes.

7
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.366
I don't know, I bought it all

8
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:15.800
Ah!

9
00:00:16.266 --> 00:00:18.700
Wow, rich people are just different.

10
00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:20.800
All have to play one and throw one

11
00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.566
Boss, wrap it up for me.

12
00:00:25.166 --> 00:00:25.966
Hey

13
00:00:26.533 --> 00:00:29.566
Wow, this place is huge. Really luxurious.

14
00:00:29.866 --> 00:00:32.366
You are, are you Mom Wu?

15
00:00:32.366 --> 00:00:35.100
Mr. Gu asked me to give him a Children's Day gift.

16
00:00:35.366 --> 00:00:38.166
I'm going to call the lady and the little master down

17
00:00:39.933 --> 00:00:42.500
I don't know what kind of person Mrs. Gu is

18
00:00:42.533 --> 00:00:45.000
It should be gentle and elegant

19
00:00:46.733 --> 00:00:48.233
Aunt Linza, be quiet

20
00:00:50.366 --> 00:00:51.666
Someone is calling me

21
00:00:52.333 --> 00:00:54.033
Why does that sound so familiar?

22
00:01:02.333 --> 00:01:03.166
I'll go.
