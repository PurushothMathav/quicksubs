00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:02.166
You are still obsessed

2
00:00:03.666 --> 00:00:05.433
You stole my identity

3
00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.233
Drive away my child

4
00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:10.233
And find someone to hurt me in the most vicious way

5
00:00:11.933 --> 00:00:15.033
Do you think I'll get dirty because of this?

6
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.766
Only your heart is dirty

7
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.500
You still look like this

8
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.300
You are noble, aren't you?

9
00:00:24.766 --> 00:00:27.800
Why don't I live a rich life?

10
00:00:27.966 --> 00:00:30.066
How am I not as good as you?

11
00:00:30.966 --> 00:00:34.533
In the end, in the end, it's just that God doesn't have eyes

12
00:00:34.533 --> 00:00:37.033
It's my own bad life, not my life

13
00:00:37.366 --> 00:00:39.033
It's your choice.

14
00:00:39.533 --> 00:00:41.066
Your every choice

15
00:00:41.366 --> 00:00:43.266
Made your unbearable today

16
00:00:45.933 --> 00:00:47.700
My choice is correct

17
00:00:48.266 --> 00:00:49.900
It's never wrong.

18
00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.633
Is stone is stone

19
00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:55.066
It was that bitch who killed me

20
00:00:58.533 --> 00:01:00.266
It's you who hurt me

21
00:01:00.466 --> 00:01:02.133
You ruined me

22
00:01:02.133 --> 00:01:03.733

23
00:01:03.733 --> 00:01:04.833

I have to go to school and work every day

41
00:01:51.466 --> 00:01:52.566
I'm exhausted.

42
00:01:52.566 --> 00:01:54.666

How difficult is it to have a horse fan? Almost

45
