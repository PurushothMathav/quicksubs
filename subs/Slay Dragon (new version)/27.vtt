00:00:01.966 --> 00:00:04.633
Laugh. I'll just ask you this.

2
00:00:04.766 --> 00:00:06.800
Back then, my Li family was destroyed

3
00:00:07.266 --> 00:00:08.266
How many participants?

4
00:00:08.266 --> 00:00:09.800
Is that what you said?

5
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.866
Well, since this is your word

6
00:00:11.866 --> 00:00:13.633
Then I must have answered with a soul

7
00:00:13.666 --> 00:00:15.266
Everything that year

8
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:16.700
It's all a secret I told the prince

9
00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:18.700
You don't think about it either

10
00:00:18.733 --> 00:00:20.100
The most mysterious secret path of the Li family

11
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.000
How could it suddenly appear?

12
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.033
10 main killers

13
00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.800
Of course I made the secret ah ah ah

14
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.566
You probably didn't know that.

15
00:00:29.933 --> 00:00:32.533
When I saw the blood of that old man

16
00:00:32.533 --> 00:00:35.066
When it came out of his chest like a fountain

17
00:00:35.066 --> 00:00:35.966
Ah!

18
00:00:36.566 --> 00:00:38.600
Never mind how cool it is

19
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:39.133
What a pity!

20
00:00:39.133 --> 00:00:41.900
This old man really told him everything

21
00:00:42.166 --> 00:00:44.400
You tried to impress me with your heart

22
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:45.266
pity

23
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.566
The biggest mistake he made was stupidity

24
00:00:47.566 --> 00:00:50.600
And stupid let him die

25
00:00:53.533 --> 00:00:54.500
I never thought of that.

26
00:00:54.933 --> 00:00:57.433
I never thought I would be here today

27
00:00:57.533 --> 00:00:58.966
You dog

28
00:00:59.166 --> 00:01:00.966
Finally got scared

29
00:01:00.966 --> 00:01:01.766
Li Xuan

30
00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.000
It's not too late for you to kneel and kowtow to me and apologize

31
00:01:05.366 --> 00:01:06.466
I can consider it.

32
00:01:06.933 --> 00:01:09.100
I'm afraid that the family here will stay by my side and be a dog

33
00:01:10.933 --> 00:01:13.033
One cent is divided into three knives

34
00:01:13.466 --> 00:01:16.800
Just to get revenge before blood hate

35
00:01:17.066 --> 00:01:19.066
Can reduce some killing intent

36
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.600
I didn't expect that I wouldn't have an operation in advance today

37
00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.266
I didn't expect

38
00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.900
The person who has to have blood will be my brother

39
00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:32.100
The boy is so crazy when he is about to die

40
00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:33.700
Hahaha good

41
00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.300
The crazier you are, the more excited I am

42
00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.166
Heaven knows I was in eight years

43
00:01:38.166 --> 00:01:40.100
How did this light come about?

44
00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.466
God knows how many nights I have

45
00:01:42.466 --> 00:01:44.466
See you, a remnant like you

46
00:01:44.466 --> 00:01:46.366
I can't sleep at night.

47
00:01:46.533 --> 00:01:49.466
God knows how many nights I've watched

48
00:01:50.066 --> 00:01:51.300
Cut off your dog's head

49
00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:54.066
The fog must be rooted

50
00:01:54.066 --> 00:01:56.633
I propose that our four families

51
00:01:56.933 --> 00:01:59.233
Break his limbs with sticks

52
00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:01.766
Slowly lift him up

53
00:02:01.766 --> 00:02:03.266
A thousand cuts

54
00:02:03.333 --> 00:02:05.900
Must be enough for $3,000, yeah yeah

55
00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:06.866
Scrape enough for $3,000

56
00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:08.200
No matter what you do

57
00:02:08.333 --> 00:02:11.366
Do it, Suzaku Ares Sword
