00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:01.633
This divorce agreement

2
00:00:02.166 --> 00:00:03.133
Is fake

3
00:00:03.133 --> 00:00:04.633
Wife dear

4
00:00:04.766 --> 00:00:05.266
Why is that?

5
00:00:05.266 --> 00:00:07.833
I just want to see if you still really love me

6
00:00:07.866 --> 00:00:10.166
This divorce agreement is fake

7
00:00:10.166 --> 00:00:12.400
Mr. Chen, didn't we agree?

8
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.033
This trash he

9
00:00:14.566 --> 00:00:16.466
You can scold my husband too.

10
00:00:16.566 --> 00:00:17.833
Dear

11
00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:19.933
I know it's not good to hurt your feelings like this

12
00:00:19.933 --> 00:00:22.400
I swear never again, okay?

13
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.366
Miss Su, you saw it too

14
00:00:26.366 --> 00:00:27.300
The misunderstanding was cleared up.

15
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.000
There is no need to continue entangling

16
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.533
Is there something wrong with your brain?

17
00:00:30.533 --> 00:00:35.100
Hello, since I have no fate with Li Xuan

18
00:00:35.333 --> 00:00:36.600
Then forget it.

19
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.400
But I have one more thing to say to you

20
00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:41.700
If you are divorced

21
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:42.966
Do you remember to tell me as soon as possible?

22
00:00:42.966 --> 00:00:46.066
I will always wait for you to make a wish at the gate of the Civil Affairs Bureau

23
00:00:46.333 --> 00:00:48.600
Don't worry, you'll never wait.

24
00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:51.800
The colder you are, the more I like you

25
00:00:51.866 --> 00:00:54.366
I will always wait for you at the gate of the Civil Affairs Bureau

26
00:00:55.266 --> 00:00:56.066
Wife

27
00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.400
You tore up 100 copies

28
00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.033
I still have 1,000 copies left

29
00:01:11.666 --> 00:01:12.566
Sign it.
