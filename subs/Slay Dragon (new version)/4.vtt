00:00:01.266 --> 00:00:02.733
Sign it. What does that mean?

2
00:00:02.733 --> 00:00:04.333
It was just acting

3
00:00:04.333 --> 00:00:07.900
I know better than anyone what you look like after all these years

4
00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:09.400
Diligent

5
00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:12.400
Laundry and sweeping are useless

6
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.933
I really don't want such a nice girl

7
00:00:14.933 --> 00:00:17.200
Dragged down by you

8
00:00:18.866 --> 00:00:21.200
Wife, how can you think of me so much?

9
00:00:21.333 --> 00:00:24.300
What others think of you is up to you.

10
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.000
If it weren't for your lack of progress over the years

11
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:27.966
Useless

12
00:00:27.966 --> 00:00:30.200
All I know is to wash and sweep the floor and cook for me here

13
00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:31.766
How could I dislike you?

14
00:00:31.766 --> 00:00:34.466
It won't be here after getting tens of billions of orders.

15
00:00:34.666 --> 00:00:35.966
To divorce you

16
00:00:35.966 --> 00:00:38.500
I'm guarding being thrown away by the building

17
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:39.733
Soldiers spilling blood

18
00:00:39.733 --> 00:00:41.466
Elves are not polluted by dust

19
00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.533
Why is it that in your eyes you are unwilling to make progress?

20
00:00:43.533 --> 00:00:44.266
Useless

21
00:00:44.266 --> 00:00:46.100
Then you go to the battlefield to kill the enemy

22
00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:47.533
Go and prove it to me.

23
00:00:47.533 --> 00:00:49.066
I hate people like you the most

24
00:00:49.066 --> 00:00:50.266
Can't make a vow

25
00:00:50.266 --> 00:00:52.566
You have to make some excuses for yourself

26
00:00:52.566 --> 00:00:54.266
That's it.

27
00:00:54.333 --> 00:00:56.166
Are these people rare to be protected by you?

28
00:00:56.166 --> 00:00:57.766
You really think you're getting out

29
00:00:58.766 --> 00:01:00.000
Chen Mei Xiao I thank you

30
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.266
I thank you for allowing me to finally see clearly

31
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.700
It's starting to make me regret it

32
00:01:04.866 --> 00:01:07.066
I will send you this tens of billions of orders.

33
00:01:07.066 --> 00:01:08.700
You are talking nonsense about these tens of billions of orders.

34
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.700
Obviously, Liu Shao helped President Chen win it over

35
00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:11.966
What does it have to do with you?

36
00:01:11.966 --> 00:01:13.366
Liu Shao is right

37
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:14.400
It's Liu Shao

38
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.800
It is because of Liu Shao

39
00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.166
Only then did Shengrong Group see my efforts

40
00:01:18.166 --> 00:01:20.766
So that my three years of hard work will not be in vain

41
00:01:20.766 --> 00:01:22.666
When I was exhausted by the company

42
00:01:22.666 --> 00:01:24.533
When being suppressed by more than a dozen companies

43
00:01:24.533 --> 00:01:26.566
Standing next to me is Liu Shao

44
00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:27.600
Not you.

45
00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.133
This tens of billions of orders was obviously given to you by me.

46
00:01:30.133 --> 00:01:30.966
You don't think about it either

47
00:01:30.966 --> 00:01:32.333
Why did you get married for three years?

48
00:01:32.333 --> 00:01:34.300
Your career can take off all the way

49
00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:37.233
Is it true that your ancestors smoked blue smoke?
