1
00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.900
Don't be too arrogant, boy

2
00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:03.766
Kill you, my Zhang family is rich

3
00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:06.666
The Zhang family is still the same

4
00:00:06.666 --> 00:00:08.200
Then my Bai family is also rich

5
00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:11.033
I don't deserve to be as rich as a Zen family

6
00:00:15.333 --> 00:00:17.266
I'm afraid this garbage will be destroyed by Yandu

7
00:00:17.266 --> 00:00:19.366
The four major families jointly demand that the corpse be torn into pieces

8
00:00:19.366 --> 00:00:20.966
Are you stupid?

9
00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:23.100
He just uses his laughter

10
00:00:23.266 --> 00:00:26.366
Just cover up the fear in his heart

11
00:00:32.133 --> 00:00:36.133
I laughed at the white paper on the Great Xia Law

12
00:00:36.133 --> 00:00:38.766
The capital offense written in black on the first article

13
00:00:38.766 --> 00:00:39.566
comfortable

14
00:00:40.133 --> 00:00:44.366
You only see power and status.

15
00:00:44.366 --> 00:00:46.033
I laugh at your stupidity

16
00:00:46.266 --> 00:00:48.866
Lowly, shameless and pathetic

17
00:00:48.866 --> 00:00:51.400
The reason why Huaxia can have today's peace

18
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.766
The reason why you can bully men and bully women with peace of mind

19
00:00:54.766 --> 00:00:56.166
Embezzlement

20
00:00:56.166 --> 00:00:59.566
It is not because the soldiers sacrificed their lives

21
00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.466
All because they use their flesh and blood

22
00:01:02.466 --> 00:01:04.566
Forge an impregnable city wall

23
00:01:04.566 --> 00:01:07.533
Keep the war beyond the borders

24
00:01:07.533 --> 00:01:09.733
As the so-called 30 years of peace

25
00:01:09.733 --> 00:01:11.133
100,000 Piles of White Bones

26
00:01:11.133 --> 00:01:13.266
Poor Huding River Ghost

27
00:01:13.366 --> 00:01:15.700
It's still a dream of returning to spring

28
00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:17.733
But now

29
00:01:17.733 --> 00:01:20.966
He was actually asking for a piece of land to settle the bones, but he couldn't get it.

30
00:01:20.966 --> 00:01:25.033
I dare ask if you really see money and power in your eyes

31
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.100
Is the lust full?

32
00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.000
There is no remnant of justice and conscience

33
00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.766
The boy is so beautiful

34
00:01:34.766 --> 00:01:36.766
I heard it all on fire

35
00:01:36.766 --> 00:01:39.300
Too bad I didn't

36
00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.700
Hahahahaha, sorry.

37
00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.166
In this world

38
00:01:44.166 --> 00:01:47.033
Status is everything

39
00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.166
And now you're not a dog's fart, so what?

40
00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.500
We'll still kill you
