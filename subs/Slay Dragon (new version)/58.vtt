00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:01.366
Morality depends on many

2
00:00:01.366 --> 00:00:05.066
Even though there are four major families running amok in the business world along the way

3
00:00:05.066 --> 00:00:08.033
Wouldn't the city government of society herd sheep?

4
00:00:08.066 --> 00:00:08.900
Shan Shuai

5
00:00:09.933 --> 00:00:12.600
Three years ago, no news

6
00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:14.500
Now being assigned to the top

7
00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:17.633
Does everything in and out of the flower reveal that he is dead?

8
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.800
Ah, how could it be Shen Shuai?

9
00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.733
He killed General Shen and survived unharmed

10
00:00:23.733 --> 00:00:24.833
How to explain this

11
00:00:25.966 --> 00:00:28.466
If Shen Dashuai is really guilty

12
00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:33.033
It's too late for him to be the commander-in-chief of the US military

13
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.500
How could you do such a thing?

14
00:00:36.066 --> 00:00:38.666
Obviously revenge

15
00:00:38.933 --> 00:00:40.266
Corrupted grievances

16
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.233
The lord is right

17
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.400
The Northern Army is majestic

18
00:00:44.466 --> 00:00:46.366
The reputation of each soldier under his command

19
00:00:46.366 --> 00:00:49.966
It's all related to the livelihood of Zhengbei Army. Is it related to repudiation?

20
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.100
If he is really handsome

21
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.633
How could it disregard the livelihood of the Zhengbei Army?

22
00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:56.766
You're right.

23
00:00:59.933 --> 00:01:04.033
Then we might as well ask Shenshuai to come out of the mountain

24
00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.866
If this god can really submit to the imperial law

25
00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.833
Then of course I am invincible

26
00:01:10.266 --> 00:01:13.233
But you really have the heart

27
00:01:13.766 --> 00:01:15.766
I have no relationship with him

28
00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.133
Why can't you bear it?

29
00:01:17.133 --> 00:01:20.300
This kind of artificial fake Suzaku Ares

30
00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:23.233
And many times the magistrate was descended from the army

31
00:01:23.733 --> 00:01:28.033
I am afraid that if he is handsome, he can't wait to eat his meat and drink his fatigue

32
00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:29.300
But

33
00:01:29.933 --> 00:01:31.566
I have another problem.

34
00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.600
If you can hire a Lu Shenshuai on your face

35
00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.600
I want him to marry us

36
00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.866
I want to make this attempt on the Chen family

37
00:01:38.866 --> 00:01:40.500
Ungrateful Bottom

38
00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.500
Garbage kills hearts

39
00:01:45.066 --> 00:01:47.066
Let's live here from now on

40
00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.200
Yixuan, where did you get such a big villa?

41
00:01:50.333 --> 00:01:53.000
This doesn't look like it was before we left home

42
00:01:53.266 --> 00:01:55.266
This is Genting Skylight Villa 1

43
00:01:55.333 --> 00:01:58.066
It was converted from the house that used to be the owner of the building

44
00:01:58.066 --> 00:01:58.366
Certainly.

45
00:01:58.366 --> 00:02:00.900
It's not something that our Li family's house could compare to

46
00:02:01.566 --> 00:02:03.600
But I promise you

47
00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:06.266
Now the light boat has passed a thousand mountains

48
00:02:06.266 --> 00:02:07.466
Waiting for me

49
00:02:07.566 --> 00:02:09.100
Only spring is infinite

50
00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:12.700
Come here.
