00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.100
gibberish

2
00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:02.900
I started the surgery today, it should be you

3
00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:04.400
Oh, it does?

4
00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:06.900
I've never heard of anyone who asks for guilt

5
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:08.466
Back-first surgery

6
00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:10.066
Ask for guilt

7
00:00:10.066 --> 00:00:14.100
You are a mere wild dog worthy of criminal investigation

8
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:16.933
I think you just threw yourself into the net

9
00:00:16.933 --> 00:00:19.100
It's not just about throwing yourself into the net.

10
00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:20.300
Moth to Fire

11
00:00:20.466 --> 00:00:23.066
I think it's mostly this bottom trash.

12
00:00:23.066 --> 00:00:26.100
He knew that he was incapable of confronting the four patriarchs

13
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:28.300
Specially run to die

14
00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:29.466
If so

15
00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:33.300
You're such a worthless piece of trash, aren't you?

16
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.800
Death can't keep up with good

17
00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:40.000
Boy, if you came to die a day earlier

18
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.266
Maybe I can give you a treat.

19
00:00:42.266 --> 00:00:43.266
But now

20
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.233
It's too late, gentlemen

21
00:00:46.366 --> 00:00:48.566
Before I cut into the Shen family

22
00:00:48.666 --> 00:00:50.600
Let me ask you three questions.

23
00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.966
Is the ceremonial guard of the Shen family the head of the Shen family?

24
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.266
And why did he come to Yandu last night?

25
00:00:56.266 --> 00:00:59.866
What happened to him after he came to Yandu?

26
00:00:59.866 --> 00:01:01.500
Why don't you use your brains?

27
00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:02.866
Think about it.

28
00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:04.800
Okay, so much to say

29
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.333
You don't mean to say

30
00:01:06.333 --> 00:01:08.400
Did you kill this Shen Dashuai?

31
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.300
Dionysian last night

32
00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:11.700
You heard it.

33
00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.200
What if you hear it?

34
00:01:13.466 --> 00:01:15.533
The sky-shaking drum rings the four seas

35
00:01:15.533 --> 00:01:17.100
With a loud sound

36
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.466
Two ten thousand horses

37
00:01:18.666 --> 00:01:20.200
Three-tone vassal return

38
00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:21.900
Four sounds of chaos

39
00:01:21.966 --> 00:01:23.433
Wusheng Kyushu Prefecture

40
00:01:23.466 --> 00:01:25.100
Liuteng Badang River

41
00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:26.700
Qisheng Tianqing County

42
00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.100
Octonic Mines Agency

43
00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:29.466
Nine Tones Divine Rate Rhyme

44
00:01:30.066 --> 00:01:31.966
Kill all the evil and be like a traitor

45
00:01:31.966 --> 00:01:33.900
What you people do

46
00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.333
It has angered the god

47
00:01:35.333 --> 00:01:37.600
Death is imminent without knowing it

48
00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.133
If you are afraid

49
00:01:39.133 --> 00:01:40.200
Beg me for mercy now

50
00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.233
I can leave you with a word of power
