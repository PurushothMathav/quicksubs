00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.100
OK

2
00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:03.066
We'll see won't we.

3
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.300
Xueshuai, these two are so brave

4
00:00:13.366 --> 00:00:15.600
Whether to cut off these two people on the spot

5
00:00:16.866 --> 00:00:19.700
Just tell them their request

6
00:00:19.866 --> 00:00:21.033
Ren Shuai promised

7
00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.500
Handsome, what do you mean?

8
00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:25.233
If they finally learn

9
00:00:25.333 --> 00:00:27.766
They are the most evil people to teach

10
00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.566
It turned out to be their enemy

11
00:00:29.566 --> 00:00:32.133
It turned out that they kept yelling for thousands of dollars

12
00:00:32.133 --> 00:00:34.600
Cut, tortured to death and then sent the armed forces

13
00:00:35.366 --> 00:00:36.800
How would they feel?

14
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.000
After all, it takes a beating to kill

15
00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.566
Before sending these idiots to hell

16
00:00:43.133 --> 00:00:45.833
I'm going to destroy their spirit and backbone

17
00:00:46.366 --> 00:00:49.266
You can report the blood debt of 49 people in my Li family

18
00:00:49.733 --> 00:00:50.866
Yes, please.

19
00:00:50.866 --> 00:00:51.766
By the way, Li Shuai

20
00:00:51.766 --> 00:00:54.000
You asked me to investigate the Li family's extermination case

21
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.366
The accomplices of the four families

22
00:00:55.366 --> 00:00:56.800
I have checked it all

23
00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:57.700
Here's the list.

24
00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:58.766
Please take a look.

25
00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.566
It seems that these celebrities in Yandu

26
00:01:04.466 --> 00:01:06.200
It needs to be uprooted.

27
00:01:06.366 --> 00:01:08.100
Gather the people on the list

28
00:01:08.133 --> 00:01:10.633
I want a public interrogation

29
00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.766
Princess, you are indeed

30
00:01:15.766 --> 00:01:18.100
It must be for this man who has been dating for two days

31
00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:19.866
Am I dying to make amends?

32
00:01:20.133 --> 00:01:23.000
Don't you think these two days are worth 20 years?

33
00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.100
If you choose the right side

34
00:01:25.466 --> 00:01:27.833
The choice is never made

35
00:01:36.333 --> 00:01:38.900
Hey, Mr. Liu, why are you here?

36
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.233
I don't know what invited me to this place

37
00:01:41.866 --> 00:01:43.500
Said it was a key sir

38
00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.766
I didn't expect it to be such an unlucky place

39
00:01:47.066 --> 00:01:48.433
Who taught us to come?

40
00:01:48.766 --> 00:01:49.833
Shit

41
00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:54.200
It's you fool

42
00:01:57.366 --> 00:01:59.400
God will not allow you to insult
