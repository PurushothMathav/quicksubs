00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.900
What about my sister, the nurse?

2
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.266
Miss Li is due to long-term overwork

3
00:00:13.333 --> 00:00:14.666
Causing severe anemia

4
00:00:14.666 --> 00:00:16.866
In addition, they are usually greatly stimulated

5
00:00:17.066 --> 00:00:18.166
Just fainted

6
00:00:18.166 --> 00:00:20.733
But take good care and you'll be fine

7
00:00:20.733 --> 00:00:21.800
Thanks. Okay.

8
00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:22.866
Thank you, doctor.

9
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.966
If hospitalization is confirmed

10
00:00:24.966 --> 00:00:26.966
Please pay the information fee ASAP.

11
00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:31.966
Did you catch me?

12
00:00:31.966 --> 00:00:34.033
Hey wait for me

13
00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:36.300
Catch what?

14
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.800
Live for face and suffer

15
00:00:39.066 --> 00:00:40.766
Mom

16
00:00:40.766 --> 00:00:42.766
Staying at the top of the group for too long

17
00:00:42.933 --> 00:00:44.300
Sure enough, it's useless for these

18
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:45.800
Tell me first.

19
00:00:47.066 --> 00:00:48.966
Hey, thanks for this effect.

20
00:00:49.933 --> 00:00:51.766
You are the person chosen by my Su Xueying

21
00:00:51.766 --> 00:00:53.233
I still care about this

22
00:00:53.266 --> 00:00:54.833
I'll give you whatever it costs you.

23
00:00:54.966 --> 00:00:58.100
Holding a frozen bank card to deceive people

24
00:00:58.266 --> 00:01:00.800
Do you really think our smoking hospital is luxurious?

25
00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.000
Princess, the bear said

26
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.300
The prince gave all your bank cards to the intermediary

27
00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:06.633
That's true.

28
00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:09.666
Doctor, there might be something wrong with my card.

29
00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.166
Can you treat us first?

30
00:01:11.166 --> 00:01:12.866
We'll definitely make up the money

31
00:01:12.866 --> 00:01:14.500
When Lao Tzu is doing charity

32
00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.500
No money for medical treatment, get out

33
00:01:16.566 --> 00:01:17.966
It's not you, why are you like this?

34
00:01:17.966 --> 00:01:19.900
They all said they would replenish the money to you.

35
00:01:20.133 --> 00:01:21.733
Pay first and then treat

36
00:01:21.733 --> 00:01:23.066
This is the rule of the hospital

37
00:01:23.333 --> 00:01:25.100
If you don't go

38
00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.033
I'm going to hand over to security
