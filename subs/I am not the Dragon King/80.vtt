00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.233
No!

2
00:00:13.166 --> 00:00:14.233
Are you all right wife

3
00:00:14.966 --> 00:00:16.466
It's okay, come on.

4
00:00:26.966 --> 00:00:28.066
Are you okay wife

5
00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.200
How could this be?

6
00:00:31.866 --> 00:00:34.766
Brother, I told you 5.

7
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:35.966
Are you all right?

8
00:00:36.366 --> 00:00:38.000
You're a liar!

9
00:00:38.866 --> 00:00:42.200
Yes, I used to be a liar.

10
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.033
But no one can trust you.

11
00:00:46.266 --> 00:00:48.866
You finally admit that you are a liar.

12
00:00:48.966 --> 00:00:49.933
So there you go.

13
00:00:49.933 --> 00:00:52.033
Okay, okay, don't cry, second goods

14
00:00:52.066 --> 00:00:53.500
What I just said is true

15
00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.166
But you have to listen to me sooner and it won't be like this

16
00:01:00.533 --> 00:01:02.333
Honey, you have to testify to me.

17
00:01:02.333 --> 00:01:03.966
I warned him just now.

18
00:01:05.333 --> 00:01:06.666
I really don't blame you.

19
00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:10.066
However, it is not a pity for these two scum to die

20
00:01:10.266 --> 00:01:13.400
It's a pity that this uncle has such good cultivation

21
00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.300
But because of his greed for evil, he caused him to eat evil bones

22
00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:17.100
quantity

23
00:01:18.066 --> 00:01:19.166
Silly you

24
00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:20.933
What's a pity?

25
00:01:20.933 --> 00:01:22.866
Unknown in this world

26
00:01:22.866 --> 00:01:24.800
There are more people who are better than him

27
00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:25.633
Really?

28
00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.466
Then I must practice Taoism well after I go home

29
00:01:28.566 --> 00:01:30.366
In the future, I will be like the old dragon king

30
00:01:30.366 --> 00:01:33.500
You don't need Dragon King Jade to resist these villains

31
00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:34.400
Good idea.

32
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.400
Wife

33
00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.266
Did you hate you at the time?

34
00:01:42.666 --> 00:01:45.500
It's not me, it's also for the sake of the world

35
00:01:46.533 --> 00:01:50.900
Why don't we go back and take a break?

36
00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:51.700
OK

37
00:01:52.566 --> 00:01:54.433
All right. All right.
