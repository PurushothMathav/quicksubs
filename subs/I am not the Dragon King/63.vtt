00:00:04.733 --> 00:00:08.200
Yo, isn't this Sister Qianru?

2
00:00:08.666 --> 00:00:12.033
Jiaoer, I'm here to buy clothes for anti-inflammatory

3
00:00:12.366 --> 00:00:13.633
What are you doing here?

4
00:00:13.966 --> 00:00:15.433
You don't know yet

5
00:00:15.666 --> 00:00:19.166
This store was given to me by Mr. Zhao.

6
00:00:19.166 --> 00:00:21.266
Then I'll go right away

7
00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.200
Sister, have you heard about me and Xiao Yan?

8
00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.833
It was my fault before

9
00:00:27.933 --> 00:00:30.066
It just so happens that I will send you and Xiao Yan a few sets of clothes each.

10
00:00:30.066 --> 00:00:31.100
Apologize to you

11
00:00:31.133 --> 00:00:33.433
The clothes in this store are all haute couture

12
00:00:33.466 --> 00:00:35.433
A set costs tens of thousands

13
00:00:35.566 --> 00:00:37.866
Come and take my sister to try on this dress

14
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.466
Ah, and this set

15
00:00:40.533 --> 00:00:43.266
As long as it fits, wrap it up for Sister Nan.

16
00:00:43.733 --> 00:00:44.800
No need today

17
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.266
Go, it's alright

18
00:00:47.266 --> 00:00:51.366
If you don't go, blame me. Let's go

19
00:01:02.333 --> 00:01:05.133
Jiao'er's clothes don't fit me very well.

20
00:01:05.133 --> 00:01:06.466
I'll go first

21
00:01:06.466 --> 00:01:08.366
Wait a minute

22
00:01:08.533 --> 00:01:10.166
Is there anything else?

23
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.866
Sister, I kindly give you clothes, you don't want them.

24
00:01:13.866 --> 00:01:15.800
How do you steal?

25
00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.433
What are you talking about?

26
00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:19.866
I didn't steal it.

27
00:01:19.933 --> 00:01:20.966
You are still young to argue

28
00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.366
I just had a couple here.

29
00:01:22.366 --> 00:01:24.266
Earrings worth over a million

30
00:01:24.266 --> 00:01:26.566
Why are you standing here for a while and then gone?

31
00:01:26.566 --> 00:01:28.833
You must have stolen it.

32
00:01:28.866 --> 00:01:29.800
What earrings?

33
00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.866
I'm not fat at all.

34
00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.766
It's not in the bag, it must be on you

35
00:01:36.766 --> 00:01:39.000
Come and take this dress off for me
