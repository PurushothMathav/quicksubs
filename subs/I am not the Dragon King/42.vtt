1
00:00:00.533 --> 00:00:03.966
When I got married and you humiliated me with Mrs. Zhao

2
00:00:03.966 --> 00:00:05.700
My heart is already dead

3
00:00:07.966 --> 00:00:11.266
I, Xiao Yan, will shave with you again.

4
00:00:12.533 --> 00:00:14.200
Eyeless woman

5
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.400
I still want to marry Xiao Tianshi

6
00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.600
Xiao Tianshi is the Dragon King and cannot kill you

7
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:19.733
I'm not afraid

8
00:00:19.733 --> 00:00:22.666
Your repeated anger is already a capital crime

9
00:00:22.733 --> 00:00:26.100
Xiao Yan, I was wrong, I was wrong, you forgot

10
00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.100
When you were first blind

11
00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:30.900
I take care of you every day, eat and take a shower

12
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:32.766
Waiting for you to go to the toilet

13
00:00:32.766 --> 00:00:34.833
Have you forgotten my kindness to you?

14
00:00:34.933 --> 00:00:36.533
You can't be ungrateful.

15
00:00:36.533 --> 00:00:37.833
I am ungrateful

16
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.566
For the past five years, I have woken up early and been late all for you

17
00:00:40.566 --> 00:00:43.100
You actually colluded with Zhao Tai to kill me together

18
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.866
In the end, my heart

19
00:00:44.866 --> 00:00:47.200
It's worthless in front of your money

20
00:00:47.333 --> 00:00:49.600
Do you think I'm just for the money?

21
00:00:50.266 --> 00:00:52.466
I have been trying to have a home with you all these years

22
00:00:52.466 --> 00:00:54.266
I get up early and I get up late at work.

23
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:55.700
But where do I go?

24
00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:57.600
Someone pointed at me behind my back and said

25
00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.666
I want to marry a blind man

26
00:00:59.766 --> 00:01:02.300
When my heart hurts, you know?

27
00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.200
You only know how to brag to me every day

28
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:06.566
How many people have you defrauded?

29
00:01:07.533 --> 00:01:09.500
But that doesn't count.

30
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.700
You don't even have the functions of a man

31
00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.766
Do you know how exhausted I am?

32
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:17.900
Chi

33
00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:21.266
You became like this to save me

34
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.433
But didn't I give my heart to you?

35
00:01:26.666 --> 00:01:29.066
I don't want to have a good future with you?

36
00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.700
Do you know the pain in my heart?

37
00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.900
If it weren't for the hospitality all these years

38
00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.000
I can't live anymore

39
00:01:37.266 --> 00:01:40.266
Do you know how I managed to survive all these years?

40
00:01:40.666 --> 00:01:43.833
Can you blame me for getting this far this year?

41
00:01:44.466 --> 00:01:45.366
That's enough!

42
00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.233
That we were truly in love

43
00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:49.833
My heart hurts

44
00:01:50.166 --> 00:01:51.266
Anyway.

45
00:01:51.266 --> 00:01:53.266
This is no excuse for you to betray me

46
00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:58.233
This is the beginning

47
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.200
The only dollar we had left when I was in the hospital

48
00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.566
Flower face up

49
00:02:02.966 --> 00:02:04.600
Head landing
