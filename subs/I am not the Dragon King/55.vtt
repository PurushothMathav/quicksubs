00:00:00.466 --> 00:00:01.700
It's Jackie Chan.

2
00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:03.400
Are you really good at coming with your mouth open?

3
00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:04.500
Take a look.

4
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.066
There's not even a bank logo on it.

5
00:00:07.066 --> 00:00:08.900
If there is no money in this card

6
00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:12.100
Boy, I'll let you take your life to pay off the debt and swipe your card

7
00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:16.866
This card can't be swiped.

8
00:00:16.866 --> 00:00:19.100
Hahahaha

9
00:00:19.133 --> 00:00:20.200
I told you so.

10
00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.366
Fake lad

11
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.700
You wouldn't say the permissions of Yuelong Hotel

12
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.766
Not enough to swipe your card

13
00:00:27.766 --> 00:00:30.666
It makes sense to call your boss

14
00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.766
Yo dragon return

15
00:00:36.866 --> 00:00:40.566
I'm afraid you're buying a bargain at the stall, right?

16
00:00:40.566 --> 00:00:42.800
Suzaku, are you kidding me?

17
00:00:51.566 --> 00:00:54.066
This card belongs to the Dragon King Palace

18
00:00:54.133 --> 00:00:55.533
Bring Your Own Spirituality

19
00:00:55.533 --> 00:00:58.000
If it falls into the hands of ordinary people like you

20
00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.200
Nature has experienced

21
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:02.633
If it is in my hands, it will recover naturally.

22
00:01:02.666 --> 00:01:03.833
Hahaha

23
00:01:04.566 --> 00:01:06.466
You see, the golden dragon has flown back.

24
00:01:06.466 --> 00:01:08.400
The boy is dying

25
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.933
You still deceive me with this trick of running away from the rivers and lakes

26
00:01:10.933 --> 00:01:11.733
main power

27
00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:14.800
How come?

28
00:01:15.066 --> 00:01:17.100
Boss Yue, you came just in time

29
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.866
This kid is pretending to be the Dragon King

30
00:01:18.866 --> 00:01:21.500
And washed his feet with 90 million tons of wine

31
00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.866
Now I'm going to check out with this toy card

32
00:01:23.866 --> 00:01:26.433
You cut off his feet for me right now

33
00:01:27.333 --> 00:01:28.366
Supreme Dragon Card

34
00:01:28.366 --> 00:01:29.700
You take a good look

35
00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.166
That's clearly a fake card

36
00:01:31.166 --> 00:01:32.100
Can't be wrong

37
00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:35.000
Elder Suzaku once used the Supreme Dragon Card in our store

38
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.266
I've seen you kid, what a pains

39
00:01:38.266 --> 00:01:40.366
I just swiped his card

40
00:01:40.366 --> 00:01:41.833
Not a penny

41
00:01:41.966 --> 00:01:43.166
Obviously it's fake

42
00:01:43.166 --> 00:01:44.600
To swipe the Supreme Dragon Card

43
00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.700
You have to use this special card reader.

44
00:01:47.866 --> 00:01:50.300
Try it, offended
