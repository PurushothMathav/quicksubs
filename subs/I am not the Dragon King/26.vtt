00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.766
Shen Guan, don't you like to pretend?

2
00:00:02.766 --> 00:00:05.166
I want to see how you died today

3
00:00:05.166 --> 00:00:08.233
This first step requires a strong person to cross the tribulation

4
00:00:08.366 --> 00:00:09.100
kid

5
00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:12.466
You are so young to provoke me Baidu in the Western Regions

6
00:00:12.466 --> 00:00:14.466
Hmph, it's just suicide

7
00:00:14.966 --> 00:00:17.966
Well we'll see.

8
00:00:20.266 --> 00:00:22.500
I hope Fan Wu didn't lie to me.

9
00:00:25.066 --> 00:00:26.733
It goes out. It goes out.

10
00:00:26.733 --> 00:00:29.100
Fan Wu really didn't fool me

11
00:00:32.166 --> 00:00:34.766
It turns out that this kid doesn't know any Dao skills at all

12
00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:38.066
It seems that he is going to be out of the limelight today

13
00:00:38.066 --> 00:00:38.666
That's not possible.

14
00:00:38.666 --> 00:00:39.466
He makes

15
00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:41.766
There must be something wrong with the Fa-rectification

16
00:00:41.766 --> 00:00:42.366
shut up

17
00:00:42.366 --> 00:00:45.100
Are you questioning my ability in the Ten Kingdoms of the Western Regions?

18
00:00:45.133 --> 00:00:48.100
Boy, this envoy actually underestimates you

19
00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.233
But even if you can take this first step

20
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.566
You don't have the mission of being an immortal

21
00:00:53.566 --> 00:00:56.966
This second step can kill you

22
00:00:57.933 --> 00:01:00.866
I have nothing to fear

23
00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.500
What is a mere subsidence?

24
00:01:10.766 --> 00:01:12.633
This kid is young

25
00:01:12.866 --> 00:01:14.700
How can there be such a high cultivation base

26
00:01:14.733 --> 00:01:16.566
I went out. I came back.

27
00:01:16.566 --> 00:01:17.466
I'm going out.

28
00:01:17.466 --> 00:01:19.366
I'm back. I'm out again.

29
00:01:19.666 --> 00:01:21.900
What is a mere eye full of tricks?

30
00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:23.700
You said he was fake.

31
00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.066
How dare you be an envoy

32
00:01:25.666 --> 00:01:28.366
I bet my life he's a liar

33
00:01:28.366 --> 00:01:30.700
There must be something wrong with the envoy's words

34
00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.500
Shut up and dare to question my protection of the Western Regions

35
00:01:35.133 --> 00:01:38.066
After the 60,000-mile mountain country, boy

36
00:01:38.066 --> 00:01:40.100
It takes nerve power to break through

37
00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.066
Hmph, I'll see how you go

38
00:01:42.466 --> 00:01:44.900
The cultivation of this Dragon King goes beyond the realm of gods

39
00:01:44.933 --> 00:01:49.166
Look good, I will pass this thousands of miles in an instant

40
00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.066
not good
