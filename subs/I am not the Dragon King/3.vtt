1
00:00:00.733 --> 00:00:03.966
Stop, Mr. Zhao and I are in love

2
00:00:04.133 --> 00:00:06.500
I just wanted to lie to you, you trash

3
00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:08.100
Just sign a divorce agreement

4
00:00:08.566 --> 00:00:11.366
Li Jiaoer, why are you doing this to me?

5
00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:12.666
In the past five years

6
00:00:12.666 --> 00:00:14.466
You use the name of my Li family son-in-law

7
00:00:14.466 --> 00:00:15.900
Abducting everywhere

8
00:00:15.933 --> 00:00:17.766
It made me lose face.

9
00:00:18.733 --> 00:00:21.200
Even if you could satisfy me once in the past five years

10
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.033
I won't refund you.

11
00:00:23.133 --> 00:00:24.233
Hahaha

12
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.933
I became like this to save you

13
00:00:26.933 --> 00:00:28.633
I not only lost my dignity as a man

14
00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:29.933
He's blind.

15
00:00:29.933 --> 00:00:31.166
You are ungrateful

16
00:00:31.266 --> 00:00:32.700
Are you still human?

17
00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:34.866
I'm really blind

18
00:00:34.866 --> 00:00:37.400
I was actually engaged to you, a piece of trash

19
00:00:37.733 --> 00:00:40.233
Zhao Gongzi is the richest man in the building

20
00:00:40.333 --> 00:00:42.266
Only he is worthy to be my man

21
00:00:42.266 --> 00:00:45.400
Only he can give me the life I want

22
00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.866
Is money more important than sincerity?

23
00:00:49.366 --> 00:00:50.500
Money is not important

24
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.966
The important thing is that having money can cultivate relationships

25
00:00:53.966 --> 00:00:57.100
Five years ago, when the Dragon King was in retreat and practicing, he promised

26
00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:58.366
Exit customs today

27
00:00:58.366 --> 00:01:00.300
To transfer the commercial agency rights of the Dragon King Palace

28
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.666
Handed over to the first family in the building

29
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.266
Zhao Gongzi is the richest man in the building

30
00:01:05.333 --> 00:01:07.300
It is inevitable that no one can stop it

31
00:01:07.466 --> 00:01:09.100
Tonight at the Holy Dragon Feast

32
00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.466
The business agency of the Dragon King Palace is not the Zhao family

33
00:01:12.866 --> 00:01:15.766
As long as I divorce you trash

34
00:01:16.133 --> 00:01:18.200
Naturally, I can marry Mr. Zhao

35
00:01:18.266 --> 00:01:21.266
By then, my Li family will soar into the sky

36
00:01:21.333 --> 00:01:23.566
If you want to live, punk

37
00:01:23.566 --> 00:01:26.233
Just sign this divorce letter for me

38
00:01:26.566 --> 00:01:29.766
If you want to get out of the marriage, I won't sign it even if I kill you.

39
00:01:29.866 --> 00:01:30.900
If so

40
00:01:31.366 --> 00:01:32.300
To hell with that.

41
00:01:33.266 --> 00:01:34.933
It is now a society ruled by law

42
00:01:34.933 --> 00:01:37.100
You can't escape if you want to kill me

43
00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.266
It makes sense for a blind man to stumble and fall to his death.

44
00:01:40.266 --> 00:01:42.733
You look poor and blind

45
00:01:42.733 --> 00:01:44.166
Not even a man

46
00:01:44.166 --> 00:01:46.366
What qualifications do you have to live in this world?

47
00:01:46.466 --> 00:01:49.033
Oh, I forgot to tell you.

48
00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:53.566
I was the one who hit you like this 5 years ago with a drunk driving

49
00:01:53.566 --> 00:01:55.200
Hahaha

50
00:01:59.166 --> 00:01:59.966
Ah!
