00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:01.700
What are you doing?

2
00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:03.166
You all told me to call the police

3
00:00:03.166 --> 00:00:04.200
What are you doing?

4
00:00:05.466 --> 00:00:07.166
Who said to call the police?

5
00:00:07.166 --> 00:00:10.166
It was me. They asked me to steal again

6
00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:14.600
Yo, isn't this Section Chief Zhao of the Security Division?

7
00:00:15.166 --> 00:00:16.166
Don't get close

8
00:00:16.766 --> 00:00:18.066
Who was going to call the police just now?

9
00:00:18.066 --> 00:00:21.300
It's me. They accused me of stealing

10
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.500
Don't worry, as the head of the Kyoto Security Section

11
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.033
I will enforce the law impartially

12
00:00:26.533 --> 00:00:27.900
Since you said you didn't steal it

13
00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.366
Take off your clothes

14
00:00:29.366 --> 00:00:30.666
You can't tell at a glance

15
00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:33.233
The head of the security section is indeed fair

16
00:00:33.666 --> 00:00:36.566
Come on. I really didn't steal it.

17
00:00:36.733 --> 00:00:37.566
I entrust

18
00:00:38.466 --> 00:00:39.266
I can not

19
00:00:39.966 --> 00:00:40.866
I drag it myself

20
00:00:41.133 --> 00:00:42.066
I drag it myself

21
00:00:42.133 --> 00:00:43.700
Excuse me

22
00:00:44.066 --> 00:00:45.866
You turn your head.

23
00:00:46.566 --> 00:00:49.900
How can I be fair to you if the undergraduate doesn't see me in person?

24
00:00:50.166 --> 00:00:51.600
procrastinate or not

25
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.366
Immediately throw you in jail

26
00:01:01.733 --> 00:01:04.466
I only got 80% of my 7,000 yuan

27
00:01:04.733 --> 00:01:06.966
Is it hidden in there?

28
00:01:07.966 --> 00:01:08.700
It seems

29
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.766
Only the undergraduate head personally helped you prove your innocence?

30
00:01:11.766 --> 00:01:14.333
What are you doing to help me?

31
00:01:14.333 --> 00:01:16.833
Help! Stop
