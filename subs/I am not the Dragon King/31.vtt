00:00:08.266 --> 00:00:10.200
Is this the real Dragon Jade?

2
00:00:10.266 --> 00:00:12.766
Shenlong Jade actually took the initiative to summon Shenlong

3
00:00:12.766 --> 00:00:14.066
Protect this kid

4
00:00:14.066 --> 00:00:16.333
Could he be the one I've been searching for all these years?

5
00:00:16.333 --> 00:00:17.766
The most virtuous person

6
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.533
Ah, did you all see it?

7
00:00:20.533 --> 00:00:21.666
Did he do it first?

8
00:00:21.666 --> 00:00:22.633
It has nothing to do with me.

9
00:00:22.933 --> 00:00:25.166
Your Shenlong Jade is real.

10
00:00:25.166 --> 00:00:26.433
Where did you get it?

11
00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.066
Of course, only the Dragon King can wear the Dragon Jade.

12
00:00:30.166 --> 00:00:32.400
Now that you know that this jade is real

13
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:36.933
Then you are a fake Dragon King and you are not recruited from the truth

14
00:00:36.933 --> 00:00:38.766
Who are you really?

15
00:00:38.966 --> 00:00:39.966
And I said, "Okay.

16
00:00:40.366 --> 00:00:44.200
I am actually Mr. Xu who practices on Lingyin Mountain

17
00:00:44.366 --> 00:00:47.200
How dare you!

18
00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.266
Somebody, get him out of here

19
00:00:49.333 --> 00:00:51.966
Yes, even though I am fake

20
00:00:51.966 --> 00:00:53.800
But he's not real

21
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.766
I have been practicing for decades and have broken through the Golden Wonderland

22
00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.400
I heard that the Dragon King is about to leave the customs.

23
00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:59.400
I will visit in person

24
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.066
But the Dragon King did not return

25
00:01:01.066 --> 00:01:03.366
Thousand Miles Transmission said that the Shenlong Jade was lost

26
00:01:03.366 --> 00:01:05.966
So it is impossible to come to tonight's feast

27
00:01:06.166 --> 00:01:08.300
So I impersonated the Dragon King

28
00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:10.000
Take the opportunity to think about the benefits of being old

29
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.566
I personally saw my Dragon King's smile in the Dragon King Hall

30
00:01:12.566 --> 00:01:13.833
Not this kid
