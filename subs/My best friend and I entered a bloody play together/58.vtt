00:00:01.333 --> 00:00:02.600
Who are you?

2
00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:05.333
Why did you move my high-speed rail case?

3
00:00:05.333 --> 00:00:06.666
That's my collection.

4
00:00:06.733 --> 00:00:08.033
Cher Cher

5
00:00:08.133 --> 00:00:10.166
Got it, the company is operating illegally

6
00:00:10.733 --> 00:00:13.800
Seizure is now filing for bankruptcy

7
00:00:15.533 --> 00:00:16.366
When did this happen?

8
00:00:16.366 --> 00:00:17.366
Just yesterday.

9
00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.966
The Southern Family thing is shipped away behind your back, right?

10
00:00:20.266 --> 00:00:21.566
You go pack your bags too

11
00:00:21.733 --> 00:00:23.766
I have mortgaged this house

12
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.500
Then move away

13
00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.366
Moved away, moved away, left Yuncheng

14
00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.600
Let's find a smaller city.

15
00:00:31.733 --> 00:00:33.133
There is still some money at home

16
00:00:33.133 --> 00:00:35.266
We could rent a smaller house.

17
00:00:35.266 --> 00:00:37.300
Daughter-in-law, this is dad, I'm sorry for you

18
00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:38.500
Bring you home

19
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.200
Didn't give you a good life

20
00:00:40.966 --> 00:00:42.266
As long as our family can be together

21
00:00:42.266 --> 00:00:43.700
Who is your family?

22
00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:45.800
I don't want to live a hard life

23
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.766
I don't want Cher
