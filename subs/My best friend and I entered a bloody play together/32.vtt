00:00:01.966 --> 00:00:04.366
This always looks like it can't be found.

2
00:00:04.966 --> 00:00:07.400
I hope the Song family will not lose

3
00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:11.600
Cher, that's great.

4
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:12.766
Only you are there

5
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:15.733
Keep your voice down

6
00:00:15.733 --> 00:00:16.766
Mom just went out for a while

7
00:00:16.766 --> 00:00:18.166
I'm not happy to hear you go back and forth first

8
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:19.566
Mom?

9
00:00:20.333 --> 00:00:21.133
you

10
00:00:22.333 --> 00:00:23.133
you

11
00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.600
You are talking about the Song family.

12
00:00:25.966 --> 00:00:29.633
Cher, you know they're not good people, right?

13
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.666
Is that just for you

14
00:00:32.733 --> 00:00:34.233
The Song family as parents

15
00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:35.800
It's always been good to me.

16
00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:36.766
and

17
00:00:36.866 --> 00:00:38.966
They really see me as their brother's leader

18
00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:41.500
OK

19
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:43.500
Oh, I see.

20
00:00:46.133 --> 00:00:46.933
Qianqian

21
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.600
Since we came into this world

22
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.700
We have to accept that the world has changed us

23
00:00:52.166 --> 00:00:53.400
Like what?

24
00:00:54.466 --> 00:00:55.866
My heart disease

25
00:00:56.766 --> 00:00:58.233
And my new parents

26
00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.600
12 I told you

27
00:01:03.666 --> 00:01:05.900
I will definitely find a way to cure your disease

28
00:01:06.066 --> 00:01:07.366
No matter how much it costs

29
00:01:07.366 --> 00:01:09.100
But that's not enough.

30
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.800
Qingqing, can you promise me one thing?

31
00:01:13.666 --> 00:01:14.700
What's up

32
00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.300
It's about
