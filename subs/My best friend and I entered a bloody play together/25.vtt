00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:02.800
This necklace is so expensive.

2
00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:04.400
Don't try to be a rascal!

3
00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:06.200
You just got the cream for so many people.

4
00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:08.366
You want to pay me for the necklace.

5
00:00:11.766 --> 00:00:15.733
Oops, didn't I want to give Cher a breather?

6
00:00:15.733 --> 00:00:17.266
Oh, dear.

7
00:00:17.733 --> 00:00:19.766
My heart suddenly hurts, please explain it to him

8
00:00:19.766 --> 00:00:21.366
Get out of here. I get mad when I see him

9
00:00:21.366 --> 00:00:22.500
Don't worry, don't worry

10
00:00:22.566 --> 00:00:23.633
I'll give him the money right away

11
00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.000
Don't be angry don't be angry

12
00:00:29.266 --> 00:00:31.466
Let's go to the world, let's have a meeting

13
00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.400
I like people as generous as you

14
00:00:35.733 --> 00:00:37.433
Don't worry, I'll be right back.

15
00:00:37.766 --> 00:00:39.833
Everyone, eat and drink well.

16
00:00:41.566 --> 00:00:43.066
He was lying just now.

17
00:00:43.466 --> 00:00:45.333
Hey Song Qian, don't go

18
00:00:45.333 --> 00:00:47.066
I just finished the math for you.

19
00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:53.766
You probably had that fucking crooked look just now.

20
00:00:53.933 --> 00:00:54.600
Scared me to death

21
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.233
Did he think we were breaking up?

22
00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:06.766
The luck of coming to the scenery allowed him to accompany Qianqian

23
00:01:06.766 --> 00:01:08.500
Accompanying my ashes to life and death

24
00:01:08.933 --> 00:01:11.633
It seems that the old lady has to cook it herself

25
00:01:12.133 --> 00:01:14.000
They were hilarious.

26
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.800
I think you should have just finished work

27
00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.266
Stop

28
00:01:19.266 --> 00:01:20.066
Mom

29
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Why are you so young to dare to fight my daughter?
