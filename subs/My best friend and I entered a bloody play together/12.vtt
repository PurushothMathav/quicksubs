00:00:03.533 --> 00:00:06.400
Hello, can I help you?

2
00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:09.666
I have a nice orange ring here.

3
00:00:09.666 --> 00:00:12.866
There is still such a big diamond on it, you say

4
00:00:16.533 --> 00:00:19.066
It's a ring, etc.

5
00:00:19.333 --> 00:00:20.366
Why is this so similar?

6
00:00:20.366 --> 00:00:21.333
The police are with us

7
00:00:21.333 --> 00:00:23.566
A custom-made limited edition engagement ring?

8
00:00:23.566 --> 00:00:26.066
This is the only one in the world

9
00:00:27.333 --> 00:00:29.300
Hey what do you think of these try it on

10
00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:30.933
Are you going to say it after so long?

11
00:00:30.933 --> 00:00:32.966
Don't you say I'm going to dinner with my friends?

12
00:00:32.966 --> 00:00:34.366
Take us

13
00:00:34.466 --> 00:00:36.500
Please wait a moment.

14
00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:40.600
Hey come on

15
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.466
I hired two electronic thieves.

16
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.966
Remember something big

17
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.300
What's the hurry?

18
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:49.866
There was a pet under the group just now.

19
00:00:49.866 --> 00:00:51.266
Someone from the store called

20
00:00:51.266 --> 00:00:52.833
Someone stole your engagement ring

21
00:00:52.966 --> 00:00:54.800
I'm also going to change it and sell it for money.

22
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.566
That chocolate

23
00:00:56.566 --> 00:00:58.166
Got it, it's in the store now

24
00:00:58.166 --> 00:00:59.266
Drive over now

25
00:00:59.266 --> 00:01:00.266
I'd like to see it

26
00:01:00.266 --> 00:01:03.066
It's you who don't understand that you are willing to break my stuff yourself
