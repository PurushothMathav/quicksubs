00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:01.900
Car accident you

2
00:00:15.133 --> 00:00:16.033
That's not possible.

3
00:00:16.966 --> 00:00:19.466
We obviously jumped off the stairs together

4
00:00:19.666 --> 00:00:21.900
Oops, why are you talking nonsense?

5
00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.633
You can't have a concussion, can you?

6
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.233
Happy, I'll go get the doctor over now.

7
00:00:27.466 --> 00:00:28.266
And so forth.

8
00:00:34.933 --> 00:00:36.000
elder sister

9
00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:42.600
elder sister

10
00:00:43.566 --> 00:00:46.833
It's me. We're back.

11
00:00:52.466 --> 00:00:56.400
Sorry, sorry, sorry, I was wrong.

12
00:00:56.533 --> 00:00:59.233
I don't know why I did it.

13
00:00:59.533 --> 00:01:00.333
Since

14
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.166
Now that we're all back, can you forgive me?

15
00:01:03.166 --> 00:01:04.966
I was wrong, sorry.

16
00:01:04.966 --> 00:01:06.466
I want you to promise me

17
00:01:07.333 --> 00:01:09.133
Never fall in love with a boyfriend

18
00:01:09.133 --> 00:01:10.700
Seeing two men competing for you

19
00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:11.800
What do I do?

20
00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.300
Vicious vicious

21
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.666
Song Qianqian, you actually call me vicious

22
00:01:15.666 --> 00:01:16.333
If it weren't for you

23
00:01:16.333 --> 00:01:18.100
How did I end up in a place like this?

24
00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.366
And you said Nanfeng that you would love me forever

25
00:01:20.366 --> 00:01:20.800
Why is that?

26
00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.033
Things never happen the way you say they will

27
00:01:23.066 --> 00:01:25.566
You are not as good as me everywhere, why do you tell me?

28
00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:26.433
Song Qianqian

29
00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:30.633
It doesn't matter.

30
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.466
Since you want to kill me

31
00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:35.500
Then you go to hell.

32
00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:37.933
The day before I died because of you

33
00:01:37.933 --> 00:01:39.000
If it weren't for a lifetime of sadness

34
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.500
It's impossible for you to live here

35
00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.333
Not dead is just pretending to be something

36
00:01:42.333 --> 00:01:43.433
Why do we

37
00:01:48.333 --> 00:01:49.866
Never go back

38
00:01:52.666 --> 00:01:55.666
Sister sister sister

39
00:01:57.133 --> 00:01:58.066
elder sister

40
00:01:58.466 --> 00:02:01.300
In this world, never leave, never part

41
00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:05.200
I will never leave, hahaha.

42
00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.200
You must pay more attention to rest after leaving the hospital.

43
00:02:11.733 --> 00:02:12.800
Come regularly to compensate

44
00:02:13.166 --> 00:02:14.400
Thank you doctor
