00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:01.433
Come on.

2
00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:03.933
I have red wine eggs for you

3
00:00:03.933 --> 00:00:06.300
If you drink it sweetly, you will have no worries.

4
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:07.466
Thanks, Mom.

5
00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:09.900
Qianqian

6
00:00:10.166 --> 00:00:13.166
Are you willing to tell mom what's wrong with you?

7
00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:14.966
I seem to have done something wrong

8
00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.266
Hurt the person I care about the most

9
00:00:18.066 --> 00:00:20.300
Is this person important to you?

10
00:00:20.733 --> 00:00:23.100
Well, he's my best friend.

11
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.766
As long as he wants

12
00:00:24.766 --> 00:00:26.466
I listen to him.

13
00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.133
But true friendship is mutual

14
00:00:29.133 --> 00:00:30.733
Someone you care so much about

15
00:00:30.733 --> 00:00:32.466
Does he care about you as much?

16
00:00:35.333 --> 00:00:36.300
I don't know.

17
00:00:36.766 --> 00:00:38.433
I'll hear it later, and you'll be happy now.

18
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.000
Especially you.

19
00:00:40.266 --> 00:00:42.066
Song Qingqing

20
00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.233
Okay, I don't want to worry about these things.

21
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:48.100
Look what mom has prepared for you

22
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.866
This is a horse ranch run by an old friend of mine

23
00:00:50.866 --> 00:00:52.200
The scenery there is very good

24
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.766
It just so happens that he is receiving a reception these days

25
00:00:53.766 --> 00:00:55.100
You can go to relax

26
00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:56.800
But I won't go.

27
00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:59.500
It's okay, it will be arranged freely at that time.

28
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:00.800
You must go.

29
00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.233
Otherwise, mom will ignore you.

30
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:04.433
OK.
