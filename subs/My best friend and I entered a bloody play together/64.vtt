00:00:00.933 --> 00:00:02.700
Sister Song, hurry up

2
00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:03.900
Why are you

3
00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:05.666
It shouldn't be like this

4
00:00:06.266 --> 00:00:08.066
Cheer up that scenery

5
00:00:08.066 --> 00:00:09.666
You can't die here

6
00:00:09.766 --> 00:00:11.466
Don't cry about that scenery

7
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:12.900
You start crying.

8
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:14.400
So ugly

9
00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:18.100
Sister Song, I don't regret meeting you

10
00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:20.233
No more regret

11
00:00:21.166 --> 00:00:22.300
Loved you

12
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.500
No.

13
00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.366
No doctor

14
00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.466
Mr. Song was all because of you before

15
00:00:34.466 --> 00:00:35.500
If it hadn't been taken away for a lifetime

16
00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.666
You live your whole life and finally regret it

17
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:39.100
Right

18
00:00:40.133 --> 00:00:41.500
It was my fault.

19
00:00:42.133 --> 00:00:44.000
I shouldn't have waited for you to come here

20
00:01:02.666 --> 00:01:03.566
Everything

21
00:01:04.366 --> 00:01:05.700
It's time to end
