00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.400
Cher, what do you mean? What do you mean?

2
00:00:03.533 --> 00:00:04.766
I saw it just now

3
00:00:04.766 --> 00:00:06.666
What is your relationship with Nanjing?

4
00:00:06.666 --> 00:00:07.400
Didn't you promise

5
00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:08.933
Will I never fall in love with him?

6
00:00:08.933 --> 00:00:10.666
Yes, I promised.

7
00:00:10.666 --> 00:00:12.100
I've been working hard

8
00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:12.500
I see.

9
00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.100
We are not from the same world as them.

10
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:16.033
It shouldn't have anything to do with them

11
00:00:16.166 --> 00:00:17.833
I thought you thought so too

12
00:00:17.933 --> 00:00:19.300
But Cher

13
00:00:19.466 --> 00:00:21.200
Why do you care so much about the southern scenery?

14
00:00:21.933 --> 00:00:23.000
What do you mean?

15
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.866
You asked me not to fall in love with the southern scenery

16
00:00:24.866 --> 00:00:26.700
While trying to get close to you

17
00:00:27.766 --> 00:00:29.066
Face that vicious girl Erlai

18
00:00:29.066 --> 00:00:30.666
Vicious vicious

19
00:00:30.666 --> 00:00:32.766
Song Qianqian, you actually call me vicious

20
00:00:32.766 --> 00:00:33.500
If it weren't for you

21
00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.166
How did I end up in a place like this?

22
00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.166
You said you would love me forever

23
00:00:37.166 --> 00:00:37.900
Why things

24
00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:39.800
Why is it never the same as what you say?

25
00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.600
Song Qianqian, you are not as good as me everywhere

26
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:42.800
Why are you telling me

27
00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:45.100
Cher, how could you be so coincidental?

28
00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:46.500
We are all you

29
00:00:48.766 --> 00:00:50.033
You woman

30
00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:51.800
What's wrong with calling you vicious?

31
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.966
Emotional things can't be forced

32
00:00:53.966 --> 00:00:55.700
You stop at nothing to break them up.

33
00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:57.500
I'm not afraid of being too immoral and being struck by lightning

34
00:00:57.733 --> 00:00:59.600
They were never meant to be together

35
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.533
What are you? If you say you shouldn't, you shouldn't

36
00:01:02.533 --> 00:01:05.966
I suggest you worry about yourself

37
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.266
Last time I said I would ban the Song family

38
00:01:08.466 --> 00:01:10.433
Why not just talk?

39
00:01:11.733 --> 00:01:13.166
Money Let's Go

40
00:01:20.466 --> 00:01:21.666
Hey, Cher

41
00:01:21.666 --> 00:01:22.900
Come back soon

42
00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:24.166
Something happened at home
