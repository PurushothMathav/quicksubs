00:00:00.566 --> 00:00:01.566
My sister

2
00:00:01.566 --> 00:00:03.000
Don't let anything happen to you.

3
00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:05.200
The big one?

4
00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:06.666
The big one?

5
00:00:07.766 --> 00:00:09.266
Your rebel

6
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.933
You don't know if you're okay, let me know.

7
00:00:12.933 --> 00:00:14.300
Make me worry like this

8
00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:15.666
Mom, it's not his fault

9
00:00:15.666 --> 00:00:17.300
Langfang always takes action to save me

10
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:19.266
If it weren't for Song Qianqian, this idiot

11
00:00:19.266 --> 00:00:21.400
Come out in the middle of the night and run into the mountains

12
00:00:21.466 --> 00:00:23.733
He didn't save him because I was brave and decisive

13
00:00:23.733 --> 00:00:25.566
Otherwise, he would have been feeding mosquitoes in the mountains by now

14
00:00:25.566 --> 00:00:27.000
Today is your fiancee

15
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.500
And your future wife

16
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:29.666
You save him

17
00:00:29.866 --> 00:00:31.433
It should be

18
00:00:32.666 --> 00:00:34.833
I bought food and came back

19
00:00:35.066 --> 00:00:36.966
Auntie, you are here too

20
00:00:36.966 --> 00:00:38.900
Mom, Cher is here to help

21
00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:41.000
But I think Aggie is all right now.

22
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.100
This place is enough for our family

23
00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.066
Outsiders should leave quickly

24
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.700
Cher, let's go out first

25
00:00:51.266 --> 00:00:52.866
Mr. Song, stop
