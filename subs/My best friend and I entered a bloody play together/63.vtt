00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:03.700
What do you want?

2
00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:05.933
I guess we don't belong in this world.

3
00:00:05.933 --> 00:00:07.500
It was our presence that changed everything

4
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:09.566
Now I want to eliminate our existence.

5
00:00:09.566 --> 00:00:10.566
You lunatic

6
00:00:10.566 --> 00:00:11.700
We've already died once

7
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:12.933
Do you want to die again?

8
00:00:12.933 --> 00:00:14.366
I heard about this guy.

9
00:00:14.366 --> 00:00:15.933
You can't wake up when you're dreaming.

10
00:00:15.933 --> 00:00:17.300
Just jump from a height

11
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:18.900
Dreaming will naturally wake up

12
00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:20.466
I don't want to go crazy with you

13
00:00:20.466 --> 00:00:21.700
I don't want I don't want

14
00:00:22.666 --> 00:00:23.466
Ah!

15
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.700
Tell me the ending of this story

16
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.700
At the end of this story, I must die

17
00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:28.533
As long as I die

18
00:00:28.533 --> 00:00:30.300
Everything will be fine and back to normal.

19
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.200
What about me? I'm innocent.

20
00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:33.966
I don't want you to be innocent.

21
00:00:33.966 --> 00:00:35.733
You almost killed the mother who took the scenery

22
00:00:35.733 --> 00:00:36.600
He's still dodging.

23
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:37.933
The result is that your life is uncertain

24
00:00:37.933 --> 00:00:40.033
You are an innocent dog

25
00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:41.666
I'm going to accept it all

26
00:00:47.366 --> 00:00:49.466
If you want to die, die
