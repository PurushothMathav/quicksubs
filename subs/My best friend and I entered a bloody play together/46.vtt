00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.000
Woof

2
00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:04.900
Police, don't forget he rejected you just now

3
00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:05.900
I came to see you.

4
00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:07.433
Did you hear the shelves hit the road?

5
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:08.466
Why don't you try it?

6
00:00:08.466 --> 00:00:09.566
I heard that the police officer

7
00:00:09.566 --> 00:00:11.500
Amazing my equestrian champion

8
00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:13.066
But Huo Shao is not bad either

9
00:00:13.066 --> 00:00:14.366
He learned horsemanship as a child

10
00:00:14.366 --> 00:00:16.866
And he also shot a lot of promotional videos for his horse farm

11
00:00:16.866 --> 00:00:18.500
Of course, Jinshao's suggestion is OK.

12
00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:20.266
It's just that today you are all guests

13
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.266
This is my sparrow.

14
00:00:22.266 --> 00:00:23.466
He is not as angry as you.

15
00:00:23.466 --> 00:00:24.466
It's a little unfair to you.

16
00:00:24.466 --> 00:00:25.433
Always say that

17
00:00:29.566 --> 00:00:31.366
Are you afraid of losing to me?

18
00:00:31.366 --> 00:00:33.066
Pure game hum

19
00:00:33.333 --> 00:00:34.400
How about a bet?

20
00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.166
If anyone wins this game

21
00:00:36.466 --> 00:00:38.433
It's okay, you can invite this lady to share it.

22
00:00:38.666 --> 00:00:39.466
It's a deal.

23
00:00:39.466 --> 00:00:41.933
I heard that the horses at Huo Family Racecourse are all reinvigorated

24
00:00:41.933 --> 00:00:43.766
Wait for the original surname Gu in the underground

25
00:00:43.766 --> 00:00:46.700
I say that, isn't it dangerous for the police to compete with him?

26
00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:48.133
I saw someone last time

27
00:00:48.133 --> 00:00:49.400
Fell off a horse

28
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.266
He's got a comminuted fracture of his calf.

29
00:00:51.266 --> 00:00:53.266
In the future, I still can't run

30
00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:54.966
Ouch

31
00:00:54.966 --> 00:00:56.566
Sister Nanfeng, can you stop being so impulsive?

32
00:00:56.566 --> 00:00:58.100
Do you think I'm bound to lose?

33
00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:59.000
Does winning or losing matter?

34
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.600
Yes, it is.
