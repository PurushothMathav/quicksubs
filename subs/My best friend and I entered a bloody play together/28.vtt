00:00:02.066 --> 00:00:04.400
Hey, he got sick suddenly this time.

2
00:00:04.766 --> 00:00:06.300
Fortunately, it was delivered in time.

3
00:00:06.333 --> 00:00:08.500
Otherwise it's dangerous

4
00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:10.300
Pay more attention later

5
00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:11.700
Ok thanks doctor

6
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.433
Cher don't hug me

7
00:00:15.133 --> 00:00:17.766
Cher, this happened as soon as Cher got home

8
00:00:17.766 --> 00:00:19.000
It must be different

9
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.600
Just leave her alone

10
00:00:30.133 --> 00:00:31.300
Sister Wei

11
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.500
Where are you?

12
00:00:33.733 --> 00:00:36.133
I was so scared that you would move to the hospital.

13
00:00:36.133 --> 00:00:37.366
Come over here

14
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.266
How did you become like this?

15
00:00:45.966 --> 00:00:47.266
I don't know.

16
00:00:47.266 --> 00:00:49.833
You said I had a congenital heart condition

17
00:00:50.166 --> 00:00:51.866
Sister, did you say

18
00:00:51.866 --> 00:00:53.466
And the daughter in the play is a little bit young.

19
00:00:53.466 --> 00:00:54.566
Heart disease

20
00:00:55.366 --> 00:00:57.266
I'm not going to have a heart attack. I'm going to die.

21
00:00:57.266 --> 00:00:58.400
Don't worry

22
00:00:58.733 --> 00:01:00.133
I remember in the skit

23
00:01:00.133 --> 00:01:02.000
The daughter didn't have a heart attack at all

24
00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:08.466
It won't be because we changed something.

25
00:01:09.066 --> 00:01:11.000
So even the plot changes.
