00:00:17.566 --> 00:00:19.866
What did you do last night?

2
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:32.300
Song Jingjing

3
00:00:32.733 --> 00:00:35.200
You actually slept with a duck last night

4
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.700
Hahaha

5
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.833
I'm sorry, little lady.

6
00:00:46.933 --> 00:00:48.566
Blame you for being a father

7
00:00:48.933 --> 00:00:50.366
I'm broke.

8
00:01:05.266 --> 00:01:06.300
Ok you Song Junjun

9
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.366
Ah, I'm worth a dollar.

10
00:01:10.766 --> 00:01:13.066
Why is Cher calling me so much?

11
00:01:15.466 --> 00:01:17.100
Cher, what a coincidence

12
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.400
What are you doing here?

13
00:01:19.366 --> 00:01:21.333
Unfortunately, I'm waiting for you here.

14
00:01:21.333 --> 00:01:23.400
Wait for me why

15
00:01:24.533 --> 00:01:26.766
Ah, I remember now.

16
00:01:26.766 --> 00:01:28.300
You were there last night.

17
00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:32.366
Yeah, let me tell you something.

18
00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.700
I slept with a duck last night

19
00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.000
You mustn't tell anyone about this.

20
00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:41.700
Are you sure you were talking about ducks yesterday?

21
00:01:41.766 --> 00:01:44.833
Yeah, I can't even remember what he looks like.

22
00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.000
But he seems to look alike.

23
00:01:49.066 --> 00:01:50.366
But I won't mind in the future.

24
00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.900
As if nothing had happened

25
00:02:00.466 --> 00:02:01.266
Song Qianqian

26
00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.366
Don't forget the agreement between us

27
00:02:06.933 --> 00:02:08.200
Of course I remember.

28
00:02:08.466 --> 00:02:10.700
Never fall in love with the southern scenery
