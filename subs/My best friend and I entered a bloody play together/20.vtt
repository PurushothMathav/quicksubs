00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:01.600
What nonsense?

2
00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:04.533
Isn't that Song Qingqian?

3
00:00:04.533 --> 00:00:05.600
Why didn't he come?

4
00:00:06.333 --> 00:00:08.533
I heard that when Song Jia kicked him out

5
00:00:08.533 --> 00:00:09.766
It's ugly

6
00:00:09.766 --> 00:00:11.900
He's not here to find fault today, is he?

7
00:00:14.266 --> 00:00:15.366
This is not Song Qingqian

8
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.100
Don't mess with me anymore

9
00:00:20.266 --> 00:00:22.966
Cousin, don't be familiar with this little lover

10
00:00:23.066 --> 00:00:24.966
He was just kicked out of the Song family

11
00:00:24.966 --> 00:00:27.133
She is no longer a daughter

12
00:00:27.133 --> 00:00:29.633
Now my heart is naturally unhappy

13
00:00:30.166 --> 00:00:31.466
YES YES YES

14
00:00:31.733 --> 00:00:34.066
If the Song family hadn't driven me away ruthlessly

15
00:00:34.066 --> 00:00:36.400
I won't end up like this when I go out

16
00:00:36.566 --> 00:00:38.200
You can only eat enough and wear warm clothes every day

17
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.033
Then buy the necklace.

18
00:00:40.666 --> 00:00:41.466
This

19
00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.033
This is the latest limited edition necklace released around the world.

20
00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.700
I heard it's hard to buy.

21
00:00:49.333 --> 00:00:52.166
How could Mr. Song possibly afford such an expensive item?

22
00:00:52.166 --> 00:00:52.966
chain

23
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.100
Oh, I see.

24
00:00:55.166 --> 00:00:57.300
He must have sold himself

25
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.000
How dare you hit someone

26
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.200
Excuse me?

27
00:01:02.266 --> 00:01:04.066
You're screaming like a little bitch

28
00:01:04.066 --> 00:01:06.366
I thought you guys liked to play bullying games

29
00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:08.800
Stimulate not you

30
00:01:09.533 --> 00:01:12.266
This director is a little abnormal today

31
00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:15.033
One day we will hit him and dare not fight back

32
00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.366
Look, he's bluffing.
