00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.250
What service?

2
00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:03.830
As your body's party gave the first place to establish.

3
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.450
I can't tear him down, as long as my husband gives me the reason.

4
00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:10.690
Doesn't my name have any meaning?

5
00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:16.720
Yes. Mmmmmmmmmmm.

6
00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:18.240
Hey, old fellow, it’s finally like this.

7
00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:20.240
The last time the deputy came to review the price, he brought it up.

8
00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:22.860
I said that big things are welcome, but I lied to you about what to do.

9
00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.140
Since you are in agreement, then go ahead and do something about it.

10
00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.410
Make it clear to your parents. Ah, don't let me go at ten o'clock.

11
00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.290
20 quotations from Shuiyuan Restaurant,

12
00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:31.600
You go cut cut cut cut cut cut cut cut cut cut cut cut cut cut.

13
00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.320
Okay, I get it, bye.

14
00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.640
Your charger is not there. What happened? It's okay.

15
00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:40.550
Is there anything my dad introduced me to this person before?

16
00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:42.630
He came to my place with Pinyou in there, which made me happy.

17
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.400
Although my father refused

18
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.240
But I don’t want to give them an explanation

19
00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.220
So let me suggest the opponent’s outcome on Sunday.

20
00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.530
To be honest, I don't like it

21
00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.480
you should be right

22
00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:12.550
Meet me this Sunday

23
00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:15.360
I think local 20 newspaper

24
00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:16.630
Then I don't have it

25
00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:18.890
Like me at eleven

26
00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:19.960
what's the point

27
00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:21.820
No, no, no, no, no

28
00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.140
Speak clearly to your parents

29
00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.400
It won't take long for my sister

30
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:29.640
I've been told enough for an hour. Goodbye.
