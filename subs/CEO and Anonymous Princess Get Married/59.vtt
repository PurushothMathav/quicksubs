00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:05.510
See it here?

2
00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:08.910
But don't make things worse, I know.

3
00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:14.080
This time it will definitely not be just as simple as firing the good worker worker worker worker worker worker worker worker worker worker worker worker worker worker worker worker worker worker worker.

4
00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:22.020
Work, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

5
00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.550
Go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go! Gonggonggonggonggonggong

6
00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.280
Work, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

7
00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:29.650
Work, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

8
00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:33.910
Gig Gong Gong Gong Gong Gong Gong Gong Gong Gong Gong Gong Gong Gong Gong Gong Gong Gong Gong Gong Gong Gong Gong Gong Gong Gong Gong.

9
00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:37.910
As mentioned, Fuji Machinery and China are absolutely not allowed to show off their performance.

10
00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:39.530
I bet he has a reputation

11
00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:41.930
No one is allowed

12
00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:43.710
It seems like this is not like last time

13
00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.870
Yes, it's not dead.

14
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.350
Home business

15
00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:50.750
This thing is so ugly

16
00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.340
Did Mr. Fu say how to set off?

17
00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.050
Start talking and in design technology

18
00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:58.570
I think this is the result

19
00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:00.870
It’s really a big deal.

20
00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.570
Do you know what the consequences of designing machines into adulthood are?

21
00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:06.590
You are designing the machine

22
00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:07.770
That's where the staff talk

23
00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:09.920
Or call it someone who said it was a joint venture

24
00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.880
I can help you get in

25
00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:13.760
But you are not real

26
00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:15.600
Then you can't blame me

27
00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:16.880
The baby was expelled

28
00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:19.020
It’s not necessarily your concern

29
00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:22.830
I said it wasn't him who was fired, it was you.

30
00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:24.410
You were fired, right?

31
00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.000
Thinking of your design topic

32
00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:28.960
long before commit

33
00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:30.700
You should make a baby

34
00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:32.260
so i'm sure

35
00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.940
This is his belly

36
00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:38.260
Did he give them back the My World Party?

37
00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:42.160
Not only did he come to me in person,

38
00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:43.420
It’s really Chief Zhao

39
00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.280
It seems to be your work

40
00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:48.870
No, I really know I was wrong

41
00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:50.630
Just give me another chance
