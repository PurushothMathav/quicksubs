00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.940
I'm waiting for someone, what about you? Didn't you say you would go home and sell it?

2
00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:05.980
my belly

3
00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:06.660
my belly

4
00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:09.720
my belly

5
00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:11.580
my belly

6
00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:12.840
my belly

7
00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.820
my belly

8
00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:19.860
my belly

9
00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:22.120
my belly

10
00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:22.740
my belly

11
00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.580
my belly

12
00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:24.920
my belly

13
00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:25.780
my belly

14
00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:26.360
my belly

15
00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:26.680
my belly

16
00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:26.700
my belly

17
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:26.900
my belly

18
00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:27.220
my belly

19
00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:28.100
my belly

20
00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:28.900
my belly

21
00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:33.780
my belly

22
00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.860
my belly

23
00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:35.520
my belly

24
00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:36.030

25
00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:36.650

my belly

29
00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:58.090
What do my relatives need to know?

30
00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:00.170
It's you who can't afford it if you're a little bit behind it

31
00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:08.250
This choice of family will not be the protection of colleagues in the industry.

32
00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.590
A natural meeting is like this

33
00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:11.230
There are so many people beating up

34
00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:15.750
I heard that I went to wash alone tonight.

35
00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.070
The person who chose the home will come forward when it becomes clear

36
00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:23.240
I want to be single, but who knows?

37
00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.800
But I have to cooperate with the eldest young master of my fatherâ€™s family.

38
00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.260
as far as i know

39
00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:28.340
Father, you are here soon

40
00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:30.710
If you let Father hear what you said,

41
00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.210
You're done

42
00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:39.050
