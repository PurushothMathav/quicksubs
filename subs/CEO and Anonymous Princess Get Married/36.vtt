00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.060
Old man! What's the most you can break? Don't eat that

2
00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.410
My family is quite curious,

3
00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:07.050
My uncle said that he was a man back then,

4
00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.700
What's so special about it and then say it's so beautiful?

5
00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:13.530
But what a beautiful reporter, it’s rare to count words

6
00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:15.750
I am a mess in the world,

7
00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.280
What I decided is also like this, not like this

8
00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:22.900
The most important thing is personal decency

9
00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:26.350
If my daughter could marry such a person,

10
00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:29.670
That's it, this is the world,

11
00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:31.170
the happiest woman

12
00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:34.370
Why am I listening and making fun of me?

13
00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:36.250
Did you say this?

14
00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:37.510
Actually, it’s not special.

15
00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:40.330
But there are opinions

16
00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:41.540
The man decided

17
00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:44.720
Our little brother is determined to love

18
00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:45.710
Huang Jun and I

19
00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:47.320
he is with us

20
00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:48.730
Decided, determined, determined, determined, determined, determined, determined

21
00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:50.560
We are angry together, right?

22
00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:52.740
Because you seem to be used to being together

23
00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:53.600
Really too

24
00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:56.960
I don’t know how to say it anyway.

25
00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:01.640
We want to be with you. I agree, Lao Chao.

26
00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:02.920
Don't be rude again

27
00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:04.640
I know you

28
00:01:04.819 --> 00:01:06.420
Dad, this is for your own good.

29
00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.800
No better among you

30
00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:10.380
good for you

31
00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:12.480
I'll be here until I say it

32
00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.960
And I have a long life, so let’s do it. Two, I’m white.

33
00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:23.930
What good is your life?

34
00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:26.860
Afichi Lianzheng's speech

35
00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:28.520
Anyway, Tai Lao and I are reasonable

36
00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:29.880
Then you take over the lessons yourself

37
00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:30.560
You take charge of the class yourself

38
00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:35.340
I also take over my brother’s classes by myself

39
00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.320
Since you two acted like you were married

40
00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.500
Just sell it and it will be fine

41
00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.120
your car, your house

42
00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:46.380
Eat no eat no eat no eat no eat no eat no eat no eat no eat no eat no eat no eat no eat no eat no eat no

43
00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:52.670
Eat no eat no eat no eat no eat no eat no eat no eat no eat no eat no eat no eat no eat no eat no eat no

44
00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:57.480
Eat, don’t eat, don’t eat, don’t eat, don’t eat, don’t eat, don’t eat, don’t eat, don’t eat, don’t eat, don’t eat, don’t eat, don’t eat, no, thank you
