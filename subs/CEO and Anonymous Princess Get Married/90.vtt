00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:13.470
Personal brother, I haven’t been here since early.

2
00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:15.020
My illegitimate brother left early in the morning.

3
00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:16.540
It must have been written because he didn’t want to make things worse.

4
00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:23.010
It's really a good job. Even if you say it, I'm going to do it to you.

5
00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:25.680
When one is superior, emotions follow emotions.

6
00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:35.590
Moved. Miss Bai.

7
00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:38.660
There is my video. I started it and put it away.

8
00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:43.840
knew.

9
00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.800
Here. Wait for me. Your assault lawsuit with the video of men and women having sex.

10
00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:53.710
See how you write your emotions.

11
00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:56.400
After the invention of eyes, death.

12
00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.400
After death. After death.

13
00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.330
After death. After death. After death. After death. After death. After death. After death. After death. After death.

14
00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:01.830
After death. After death. After death. After death. After death.

15
00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:02.770
Although I pretend to be quiet

16
00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:04.360
I'm afraid I won't find out

17
00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:09.800
No one dares to dare Miss

18
00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:11.930
Why are you here, miss?

19
00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:13.680
You are betraying us by being with us now, right?

20
00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:14.460
you are here

21
00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:18.720
Then we are betraying others

22
00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:20.320
She immediately communicated this location

23
00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:21.580
Ghosts are together

24
00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.920
According to the point of no need

25
00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:26.010
I’ve never seen you so no longer want my side.

26
00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:27.520
Yesterday, I was covered immediately

27
00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.240
Having an affair with another man

28
00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:30.480
Still interested today

29
00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:31.040
Actually there is something wrong

30
00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:32.160
around here

31
00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:34.460
Should I spend all my money on you?

32
00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:36.960
Or should I tell you what it is?

33
00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.320
Always let others down

34
00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:39.500
Although she didn't do it

35
00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:41.990
I've never been so kind to my wife

36
00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:43.410
Madam, you mean it very seriously

37
00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:45.750
Ignore the main character Miss Bai

38
00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:46.870
Even if you are such a coincidence again

39
00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:47.950
Since the relationship between deficiency and heat

40
00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:49.270
So I will like you

41
00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:50.990
I need to understand what it means

42
00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:53.130
I believe you can ask her yourself, yes

43
00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.390
last night

44
00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:55.630
The time is uncertain
