1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.220
We both drank water.

2
00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:04.300
I didn't get up to watch you beat the flower.

3
00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.500
Of course you are better than me.

4
00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.590
In short, she and I are in the same circle.

5
00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:15.410
So it doesn't matter for a longer time.

6
00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:16.990
It's okay to be good at biology.

7
00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:19.580
Why do you know how to chat?

8
00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:20.690
Don't rely on me, Mom.

9
00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:22.940
Add a little bit like North Korea.

10
00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.100
To my daughter, you are ready now.

11
00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:27.740
I'll be a rising star.

12
00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:30.520
So, it is playable and convincing.

13
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.520
That's the big one I inserted for me and you.

14
00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:38.520
What should we do if our legs hurt? Don’t worry

15
00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:39.600
I've been looking for someone, looking for someone, looking for someone

16
00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.270
That man was detained by the police and had no one to rely on.

17
00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:43.670
Currently working in possession

18
00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:45.570
It’s shameful to have a car and service

19
00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.310
And it's a person possessed

20
00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:48.390
Looks like something is wrong

21
00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:49.410
no personnel

22
00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:51.990
To possess a job

23
00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:54.240
Listen, I'm upset

24
00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:56.980
But how do you get rid of people

25
00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:59.210
Just pretend to be your identity the day before yesterday.

26
00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:05.760
Our provincial family follows the uncle, but ah

27
00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:07.060
You will find someone to go to

28
00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:09.090
Find a daughter

29
00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.150
You, bring the young man back to you

30
00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:12.170
Let me do it for you

31
00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.890
Find you Zhang Yan

32
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.440
most similar to the back

33
00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:16.700
Must bring it back

34
00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:18.260
thank you thank you

35
00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:19.380
sword made sword

36
00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:21.270
The sword outside the beard is broken

37
00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:30.620
The rest is me, help me, help me, help me, help you, help me, help you, help me.

38
00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:31.280
Those who do not agree with this

39
00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:32.880
It is unreasonable to hear the sword even once
