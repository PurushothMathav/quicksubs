00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.970
Literally, I don't like your red bean rings. I can do that.

2
00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.580
You have to look at your shoes.

3
00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:10.100
Ban, after showing interest in these two,

4
00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:12.480
I don’t want to let go of the two legal mistakes, who is the inferior one?

5
00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:13.380
This is experience.

6
00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:17.430
Well done this time.

7
00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:56.850
You know, wait a minute, from now on, this store’s self-inspection will be yours. Today's

8
00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:59.430
The food in that house is well prepared

9
00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:00.710
We have something to be thankful for

10
00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:03.010
I don't have any reporters left. Bye bye

11
00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:12.350
Mr. Fourth, please call the old lady.

12
00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:13.410
Then don't keep pushing your head

13
00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:15.120
Why is this so unclear?

14
00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:17.210
It seems to be the premise of the provincial government

15
00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:18.650
Is there anything

16
00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.550
What happened to him?

17
00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:22.500
It’s not clear yet

18
00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.110
Mr. Si, I know.

19
00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:25.730
What kind of people does this province have?

20
00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:27.600
So what does it mean to do without counting?

21
00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:28.760
Know about your marriage

22
00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:29.720
Run to the old lady

23
00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:30.300
Everything gets better

24
00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:31.510
I want to see it too

25
00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.930
Then I want to see it

26
00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.600
So what do I say about not dying?
