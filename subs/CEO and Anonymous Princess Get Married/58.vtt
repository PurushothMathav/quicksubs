00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:03.880
Let's help us for a moment.

2
00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:07.520
We were just in time, the water was like crazy,

3
00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:10.220
Heaven takes care of the officer for a year, ironing his design high,

4
00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.380
Take the president's dirty smoke into consideration,

5
00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:14.420
Director Sun,

6
00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:15.920
This is what I have planned to do with Yan,

7
00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:18.020
But this attitude towards you is outrageous,

8
00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:20.120
Dandi's first-level attitude,

9
00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:23.750
The little kid who imitates the kid,

10
00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:26.580
Xu Ran, you said it was a work by a woman who complied with these conditions,

11
00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:28.940
What evidence do you have,

12
00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:31.090
The proof is this design,

13
00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:32.750
I inserted a water benefit inside,

14
00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:39.740
It's an English list, just peel peel peel peel peel peel peel peel.

15
00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.980
That's just a drop of water

16
00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:44.420
Ask me to take care of the ticket machine on the bus. I'll scare you to death.

17
00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:45.870
There are no such employees

18
00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:47.690
Just take care of it

19
00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:48.770
Give this way

20
00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:52.180
You still have to succeed in Shenlian

21
00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:53.900
I'll scare you to death

22
00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:54.760
Come to the office

23
00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:00.320
You come here with my name to spare me

24
00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:01.800
Isn't it happening this time?

25
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:02.900
Facing this moment

26
00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:04.819
Am I a fool?

27
00:01:04.819 --> 00:01:07.240
It depends on what you call it here

28
00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.450
You tell your boss that he will give you some advice

29
00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:16.520
You are my dog ​​in this water.

30
00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:21.970
How do we start?

31
00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.960
Then let me talk about original knife

32
00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.020
Tidying him up is boring

33
00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:31.550
But for a novice like him who doesn’t do it

34
00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:33.090
He should understand prescribing

35
00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.740
There is not enough fire and water in the middle, I declare
