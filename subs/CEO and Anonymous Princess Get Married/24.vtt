00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.180
It was quite juicy, so much so that I gave him a black eye and took it out.

2
00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:04.180
What brown sugar should I eat?

3
00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:07.030
Is it you, how do you give me this taste?

4
00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:08.790
Mr. Guo, how much do you want to eat?

5
00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:10.230
Eat as much as you want, eat as much as you want.

6
00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:13.220
How come you've ever tasted this kind of food?

7
00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.220
How come you've ever tasted this kind of food?

8
00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:14.900
It's all delicious with this flavor.

9
00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:18.320
Of course I ate some brown sugar, so why didn’t you come back earlier?

10
00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:19.700
Doesn't it allow access to Internet calls?

11
00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:22.140
I didn’t live at home since I was born, so I will give you a mask three times.

12
00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.940
Now trouble them

13
00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:25.510
Eat eat eat eat

14
00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:27.250
Let me leave. Let’s eat quickly.

15
00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:28.450
So please, please leave

16
00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:30.370
Don't disturb our dining room

17
00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:32.250
Do you think you have enough to eat?

18
00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:35.570
Will you give it back to me? Well, well, here

19
00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:37.880
Don't get me another piece of tea. I'm so handsome. Don't do it.

20
00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:40.550
You usually say I know

21
00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:41.310
Pay attention to Zhang Cha

22
00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:42.490
The plenum was lost

23
00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.240
You're the first batsman

24
00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.880
Let’s talk about it later

25
00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:47.860
Why don't you tell me about your energy?

26
00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:49.000
You'd better choose to strike forward

27
00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.830
I was really laughing to death and I said

28
00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:54.420
I will say it all

29
00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:55.500
Who am I to analyze?

30
00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:56.320
help me through

31
00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:58.340
Mom gets up from the stairs

32
00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:00.280
Why do you always go out alone?

33
00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:01.000
Mom comes to me

34
00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:07.480
So cute, I never leave home Cocoa

35
00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:08.600
Your family’s big belly

36
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.160
Even you guys who are fat are still out of this world.

37
00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:11.440
You guys wait

38
00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:12.720
My four corners manager is here

39
00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.610
You have passed through all of them

40
00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.310
Help me, help me, help me, help you, help me, help you.
