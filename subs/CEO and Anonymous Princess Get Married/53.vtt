00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:03.130
There is no need to leave this kind of home.

2
00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:12.730
Have a good meal tonight, have a good meal.

3
00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:14.440
You still need to hold your mouth with both hands

4
00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:16.600
By the way, I just said I was right

5
00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:19.900
You shouldn't just turn it over without mercy

6
00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:23.050
By the way, forgive me for what I missed

7
00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:24.950
We have never beaten anyone before

8
00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:28.180
I'm not worried about going back. That would be the best.

9
00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:30.000
It's a formality. Why don't you go through it?

10
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:30.820
Just did a walk

11
00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:32.940
You've already gone 100% to get the nuclear test delivered to you.

12
00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.620
And I still want to twist your innocence like this?

13
00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:38.510
You can now have the perfect

14
00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:40.500
Stay in Fuji

15
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.720
Happily, I finally introduced you

16
00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.510
Can't you see it?

17
00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:45.920
He still has a little money

18
00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.060
That brush board

19
00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:52.420
What is your surgery?

20
00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:54.600
It is the economy after my master, master

21
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.020
I'll meet together

22
00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.990
I will still have one day

23
00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:02.160
What my master means

24
00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:04.360
It's a brush board

25
00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:06.530
what do you mean you

26
00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:08.530
I could really do something wrong

27
00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:10.790
Actually, would you be okay if you were angry with me again?

28
00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:13.170
I already said

29
00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.650
if you don't know how to get around

30
00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:16.210
He kicks me out now

31
00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:18.490
This kind of work is really important to me

32
00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:19.920
Let me tell you

33
00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:20.820
Let me have an angry meeting with you

34
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.280
The happy death explosion unanimously is

35
00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:29.040
I've already left and you still don't want to let me go.

36
00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:32.280
Okay, I'll take you for real

37
00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.340
thank you for thinking of you

38
00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:38.550
Next week, the possessed design will be revealed.

39
00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:40.210
Subscribe and you're expected to become possessed

40
00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:41.350
design design equipment

41
00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:42.680
Come on time with San

42
00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:44.820
You call for the third one to come

43
00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:46.220
I see

44
00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:47.080
Then I'll go

45
00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.480
Otherwise, itâ€™s fine as long as you originally owed it.

46
00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:55.760
Otherwise it's just us

47
00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:58.170
Don't give him a villain
