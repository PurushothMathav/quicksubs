00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.690
I get bullied all the time. Of course I will come to earn money for you.

2
00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:14.760
I don't think it's enough to be indifferent.

3
00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:21.850
It was you who said Tiao Xiaotian was given to you.

4
00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:24.790
It wasn't given to me. Could it be that it was given to me for trial?

5
00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:26.890
After a bite to eat, send me off,

6
00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:28.510
Are pursuing us to send to you.

7
00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:33.090
The most popular store also has this book, which of course was given to us. Yeah?

8
00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:35.100
Why don't I know how to take responsibility?

9
00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:37.740
It will be very long if you don’t go there for a while

10
00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:38.620
Come and go again

11
00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:40.350
Come and put it here

12
00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.310
Wait until I become a returning lady in the future

13
00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:44.150
You alone became this thing

14
00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:46.530
Either a small book or

15
00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:47.770
Not counting you

16
00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:48.530
Hurry up now

17
00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:49.950
paris little book

18
00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.330
Of course the phenomenon is good

19
00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.130
Why is Gao fart written in a book?

20
00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:55.030
This can turn into a disturbing book

21
00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:00.740
I summoned the person who wrote the book and said directly that it would be fine and gave me something.

22
00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:01.900
Don't follow this trip

23
00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:04.099
Hurry and go next door and hand over Mr. Fu.

24
00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:08.940
Now that you can get fired, you will return my guarantee.

25
00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:10.930
You will live up to tomorrow

26
00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:17.240
small kilometers

27
00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:19.360
How dare you be so serious? I don’t know

28
00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:21.060
I thought he was responsible

29
00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:24.670
I am responsible

30
00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:27.760
Tomorrow’s most determined plan is to leave a gift and take responsibility for the family.

31
00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:28.740
Definitely beyond responsibility

32
00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:29.260
That's beyond responsibility

33
00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.340
That's beyond responsibility

34
00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:30.440
That's beyond the scope of responsibility
