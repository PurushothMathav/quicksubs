00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.200
It seems that Tissue Xiao Huang's artificial changes are really not possible.

2
00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:06.800
Yes, you look young, but you didn't expect to be so financially rich.

3
00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:08.850
What? Sorry.

4
00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:10.730
I shouldn't pick on your work.

5
00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.550
Except if you help me give the sword, we will succeed at least.

6
00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:17.090
Our life is not perfect, your design is your fault.

7
00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.480
Young Master, it reflects our success in transforming you,

8
00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:20.920
But the law is nothing more than your feelings.

9
00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:22.600
A news worth more than 100 billion yuan.

10
00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:27.380
Young Lord, you pick the sword and I do my job, please think about it a few times.

11
00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:29.730
Hello, why does one suit both of you?

12
00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:32.270
But it’s all about how much money you have to make a successful career

13
00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:34.500
We were all given votes by Mr. Zhao

14
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:35.980
It’s not that I don’t let you

15
00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.160
You must not leave things there

16
00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:39.340
That's right, it's you

17
00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:43.200
Let’s just say it for everyone’s sake.

18
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.300
You must be the only one to win something

19
00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.580
Need me to apply

20
00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:50.630
How much does it cost you?

21
00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.580
It’s such a win-win situation here.

22
00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:56.880
Our Fuji Group has produced such good works

23
00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:57.900
Well deserved

24
00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.570
It's number one. Wait a minute.

25
00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:01.870
The only person responsible is you personally putting the money together

26
00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:04.150
Who wants to ask you for that time? No need to pay.

27
00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:05.430
don't speak belgian

28
00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:06.890
Feeling dangerous

29
00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:08.040
Still pretty good

30
00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:18.780
No, it’s better to take the motherboard photo of your relatives.

31
00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:23.570
I think this is a big problem

32
00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.360
The designs around me are not popular

33
00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:26.320
Peaceful air balloon

34
00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:27.670
But it's not noisy

35
00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:28.370
tonight

36
00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:29.410
We will avoid you again

37
00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:30.590
Invite everyone to dinner
