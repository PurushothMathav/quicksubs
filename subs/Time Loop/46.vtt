00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:03.510
Teacher Cheng, do you think Master Niang has something to do with this Wutietian thing?

2
00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:05.210
It definitely matters

3
00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:07.750
She must know something, otherwise the murderer wouldn't be able to target her.

4
00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:11.280
She might be Wu Tietian's fool. So where are you going now?

5
00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:13.900
We went to the police station and the chess car was reported as covered. Did the police know they were looking for us?

6
00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:17.920
Just say you know why the murderer wanted to get out of the car. I know.

7
00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:21.900
But I have a condition. You have to tell me what happened to Wu Tietian at that time.

8
00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.620
What does Wutietian have to do with the chess car cover?

9
00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:26.200
It's definitely not an accident. It could be murder.

10
00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:28.420
Wu Tietian’s family did not report the matter in the first place.

11
00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:29.740
we always knew this

12
00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:32.369
I heard that in the end, my family had an affair with a Tian-level hospital.

13
00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:34.010
Private couple, why did you blow up the car?

14
00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:36.390
Are you saying that your family blew up the car without hearing anything?

15
00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:38.850
Anyway, he is going to blow up his wife in a Tian-level hospital.

16
00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.790
Don't say there is evidence for this.

17
00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.770
You don't even know who the murderer is

18
00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:45.590
How do you target his target?

19
00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:46.830
Whether you believe it or not

20
00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:47.550
It’s okay if you don’t believe it

21
00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:48.950
Anyway, I'm so hot

22
00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:50.330
How do you know my itinerary?

23
00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:51.970
we have met many times

24
00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:54.560
It's okay. You have to go.

25
00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:01.250
Will your wife leave if she finds out there is something wrong?

26
00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:02.810
Next time I go back to prison and ask her

27
00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.810
Let's discuss the power supply first.
