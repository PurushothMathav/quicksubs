00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.940
Do you want to pack a bomb and ask everyone to compensate you for it?

2
00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:06.100
So what? All of you in the car don’t dare to risk your son’s life.

3
00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:08.760
This master will not die well. Even your son is alive,

4
00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:10.920
The life of others is not life. It's really a king's bomb,

5
00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:13.080
I'll also blow up your car and the people in your car, so I'll kill you.

6
00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.080
They simply do whatever they want and are lawless.

7
00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:17.740
What he told Wang Guilian was not surprising.

8
00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:19.260
It seems that the case number is

9
00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:20.220
It's all exposed, right?

10
00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:22.040
so-called evidence

11
00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:24.280
Leave it to the police thank you

12
00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.570
I should have given you the wrong lover

13
00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:29.350
He passed me by in advance

14
00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:30.390
lose you

15
00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.030
I can understand your mood

16
00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:33.730
can you tell me

17
00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:35.290
What's your plan? Also?

18
00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:36.910
where is the bomb

19
00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:37.930
After losing launch

20
00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:39.990
My cross-door Laheng Buddha

21
00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:42.730
Wen Yue can delay the upward dialing of blue

22
00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:44.670
But I have exhausted his ability

23
00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.870
He deleted all the little policemen on the Internet

24
00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:49.610
He has harmed so many people that he can beg us

25
00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:51.450
Said he wanted to push me, Lao Ben, to start

26
00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:53.890
Finally you decided to act alone

27
00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:55.950
I am old Ben because of the child's time

28
00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:57.550
It took one day to make it

29
00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:59.990
Send him back to his parents' home

30
00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:05.060
Eat from him to make this car

31
00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:07.740
And they're all in the same location

32
00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.130
Found a friend

33
00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:11.410
Let's see if the bomb can hit him

34
00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:21.330
Those are all dynamite
