00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:03.480
Okay, let the family members go out.

2
00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:06.560
Do you still want to be alone?

3
00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:08.580
Don’t worry, we have professional palace guards here.

4
00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.010
What’s your name, kid?

5
00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:17.970
My name is Tiantian.

6
00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.570
Not every day. What disease are you talking about?

7
00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:22.730
I have a fever in this school.

8
00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:24.570
They said I had pneumonia.

9
00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.880
It doesn't look like pneumonia when pressed.

10
00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.120
Mom said let me cooperate with the injection here.

11
00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:33.240
Then recover as soon as possible and go home as soon as possible.

12
00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:39.180
Thank you, aunt.

13
00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.910
Protect the palace and strike first.

14
00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:44.210
First draw 600cc, it will be used for the game.

15
00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.900
Looks like I'm about to perform

16
00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:52.740
Six shots is too much. Hello, hello.

17
00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:54.900
That doctor wouldn't let me in

18
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.880
This is some fruit I bought for my children

19
00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:02.030
Could you please help me bring it down to the child?

20
00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:04.959
He also asked Dr. Wang to give the child a lot of blood to write

21
00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:06.220
do you know

22
00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.020
Dr. Wang said that we need to conduct a comprehensive examination

23
00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:10.580
But it's not serious

24
00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:12.140
You can be discharged from the hospital in a week

25
00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:13.430
As long as it's not serious

26
00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:14.390
Then you are busy first

27
00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:15.310
I'll leave first

28
00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:20.800
to his child

29
00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.260
The inspection won’t save you so much writing.
