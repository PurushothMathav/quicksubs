00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.700
Let's get off quickly.

2
00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:11.870
This was irritating him.

3
00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:14.230
If he lived. Blow up the whole car.

4
00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:16.309
We were all fourth. you tell me.

5
00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:20.530
What exactly happens to me every day. This matter has nothing to do with me.

6
00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.750
I reminded them. So what exactly happened then.

7
00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:25.830
you tell me. I'll go tell him.

8
00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:30.440
You know who's going to transfer. The one who can get on the bus.

9
00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:36.170
Why don't we call the police? No call to the police.

10
00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.470
This place is too remote. The police are here.

11
00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:43.380
We all blew up. If he wants to change trains,

12
00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.570
I bear it alone. What are you going to do.

13
00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:48.690
Four Seasons Master Kuai Ting Che

14
00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:49.710
Someone wants to blow up the car

15
00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.700
What did I say?

16
00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:53.080
Just do it

17
00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:53.810
I want to continue

18
00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:57.300
She's right

19
00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.280
Because someone is going to blow her up

20
00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.280
She's a purple girl. Don't brag. Don't brag. Well, don't brag.

21
00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:10.750
Otherwise they all have to die

22
00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:12.830
I'm the one who wants to blow up the car

23
00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:15.330
Because she killed my money

24
00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:16.790
I want her to die

25
00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:18.840
No you really want me to die

26
00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:19.780
I did it alone

27
00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:21.060
Let others get off the bus

28
00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:22.700
I satisfy you

29
00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:28.220
What are the people in the fourth row and the back four doing?

30
00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:28.480
how how

31
00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:35.290
Why can't we get off the horse boss?

32
00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:37.630
You wonâ€™t forget to continue as usual without emotions.
