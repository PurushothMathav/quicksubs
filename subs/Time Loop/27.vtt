00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:06.450
I would have had two explosions. I know them.

2
00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:09.250
What are you two doing? You're a fucking brat again.

3
00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.010
Never mind anything else. Stop talking.

4
00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:13.150
Then I'll come up. You go. Don't run.

5
00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:15.170
You can't run away. I see you.

6
00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:18.100
stop. stop.

7
00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:21.900
Oh shit. If there is a next time, we must move ahead of time. stop.

8
00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:39.560
I don't even feel comfortable,

9
00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:41.510
I just wanted to go to the dilapidated house next door and study together.

10
00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:44.050
Who would have known that it would explode again just after it came out.

11
00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:46.560
We went to the house to check it out. There is no ranking.

12
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:47.360
What's your explanation?

13
00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.080
That's not solved

14
00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:50.440
I can't help it

15
00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:52.060
It exploded when you ran out, right?

16
00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:53.580
And it exploded twice

17
00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:54.480
Exploded twice

18
00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:55.400
Exploded once

19
00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:56.500
Then it exploded again

20
00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.220
Do you suspect there are two bombs in the car?

21
00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:59.560
If there are not two fried ones

22
00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:02.450
How come it exploded twice? What about the last one?

23
00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:04.860
Then I saw two people running to death

24
00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.240
Those two people must be Shushou

25
00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:11.200
You need to check carefully before I leave.

26
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:22.780
Is it them? Yes, yes, yes

27
00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:23.620
It's them two

28
00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:25.430
They are comrades Xiu Shou

29
00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:26.790
He was the repairman who blew up the car.
