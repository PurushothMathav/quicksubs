Wife Wife Grandma Miss Oda Wife Oda

2
00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.710
My wife is inside. Where are you guys and girls resting?

3
00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:17.210
27 little young lady

4
00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:19.320
Mr. Meng Bei, who is this?

5
00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.040
This me, who is she?

6
00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:22.370
You are a high official

7
00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.970
ðŸ…±Sauerkraut throat roast me

8
00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:24.770
I'm telling you lah, my old man

9
00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:25.130
Also borrowed include bypass

10
00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:26.410
So energetic

11
00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:27.670
Hello, hide your beans

12
00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.920
Not always unfaithful

13
00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:37.440
Although this is a crazy machine

14
00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:37.600
who is your mother

15
00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.400
That's not the same

16
00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:42.980
You should come out when you go to work

17
00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:43.560
I can fold my fingers everywhere

18
00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:45.650
Is she

19
00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:46.290
Don't be so hasty

20
00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:47.630
Tell me when you get out of the car

21
00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:50.110
My student has to get off the bus as a bus driver

22
00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:51.330
I'll help him carry his luggage

23
00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:52.450
As a result, I havenâ€™t even gotten on the bus yet.

24
00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:53.550
The driver drove away

25
00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:00.000
Didnâ€™t you know that I even called me?

26
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.020
What is the reason for car quotation?

27
00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:03.660
Is it because the car is going to blow up for me?

28
00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.319
The specific reason is that we havenâ€™t gotten to the car yet.

29
00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:06.260
Okay, it's okay

30
00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.860
you can go

31
00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:08.280
What's the progress now? Enough

32
00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:19.790
Teacher, you donâ€™t need to be too sad.

33
00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:21.530
Can we cycle back again?

34
00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:24.170
We can also loop back

35
00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.120
Now we just need to find clues

36
00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.260
Only by looping back in this way can the quotation be prevented.

37
00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.060
I got a clue

38
00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:33.860
As long as there aren't many people on the bus,

39
00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:35.960
The car must be shipped with electrical wiring components.

40
00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.350
It doesn't necessarily mean that there are many people.

41
00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:40.450
Right, from Dikou?
