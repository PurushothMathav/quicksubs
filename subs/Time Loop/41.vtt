00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:05.370
Teacher Chen found it

2
00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:07.430
Tianji Hospital is owned by Hengsheng Group.

3
00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:10.970
It seems that Xingshou blew up the boss for revenge.

4
00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:15.450
If everyone takes revenge like this, too many people will die in the hospital.

5
00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.290
Are you all going to take revenge on the group boss?

6
00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:18.970
Just find someone to hurt you if you catch a few colds

7
00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:20.650
Who would believe it if it was an accident?

8
00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:29.500
I also found the photo of Wu Tiantian’s head teacher

9
00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:34.940
There happened to be a photo of him on the official website, so we gave Shun Shun a call.

10
00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:37.540
we have to meet

11
00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:44.130
Why did you two come to me again?

12
00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:46.440
I need a favor from you so we can work together again.

13
00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:49.260
I think we can't get out of this cycle.

14
00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.200
Have you ever been like this?

15
00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:51.760
You don't want your encouragement

16
00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:52.860
Even if you get it

17
00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.260
I don’t know when the cycle will start again

18
00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:55.080
What's the use?

19
00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:57.220
The murderer wants to attack Boss Ma

20
00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:59.000
As long as we successfully organize the explosion

21
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.040
Can't you just get your agitation back?

22
00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:02.480
It’s useless for you to support Boss Ma

23
00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.160
You have to find out who the murderer is.

24
00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.060
Why don't you have fun with your brain?

25
00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.380
Just find Boss Ma

26
00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:08.700
Know who his enemy is

27
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.360
Don’t you know who the murderer is?

28
00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.060
Who is the boss and every enemy?

29
00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.460
He has many enemies

30
00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:15.800
I think this matter

31
00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.160
It has something to do with a man named Wutietiena

32
00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:18.920
As long as we find the bus

33
00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.160
Who has anything to do with Wutie Nei?

34
00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:21.480
Whoever it is must be Chesthand

35
00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:22.400
Don't say so much

36
00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:23.440
Just say it

37
00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:24.220
What do you need from me?

38
00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.640
Let go of someone
