00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:02.440
Autumn car! Stop the car quickly!

2
00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:04.180
The car is about to explode! I want to get out of the car!

3
00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:09.090
What is it not?

4
00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:11.510
You go back and do it right! Really! This car has a bomb!

5
00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.530
I’m getting off the car anyway! I don’t want to die!

6
00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:16.149
Oops! You can't park here! What's wrong with you?

7
00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.150
Open the door quickly! This man must be sick again!

8
00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:20.590
There was everyone! I met one on stage!

9
00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:23.410
They said cars are attractive! Have you forgotten all about them?

10
00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.250
I really didn’t lie to you!

11
00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:26.930
These two cars are really going to explode!

12
00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:29.130
The bomb is in the suitcase! If you don't believe me, go check it out!

13
00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:31.390
Otherwise we will all die!

14
00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:33.950
Brother! There's nothing in our suitcase!

15
00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:35.890
Everyone goes through security checks as they move in.

16
00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:37.430
What she said is true

17
00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:38.570
The car will really explode

18
00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:40.650
But the bomb is not in the suitcase

19
00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:41.450
Just why

20
00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:42.810
The suitcase didn't move

21
00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:44.100
i can prove

22
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.360
His car is about to explode

23
00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:46.440
I didn't rush to copy the car

24
00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.070
Really not

25
00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:49.150
both of them

26
00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:50.010
It can also be proven

27
00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:50.910
I don't want to die

28
00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:51.770
Stop the car quickly

29
00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.550
You two, don't follow me

30
00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:54.930
This is no joke

31
00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.070
This thing is true

32
00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.430
Even if you don’t get off the car

33
00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:59.190
We also have to get off Chen Ai

34
00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.250
You hurry back to your seat

35
00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:01.570
Don't mess with your wife here

36
00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:02.710
I'm really not messing around

37
00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:03.930
If we don't get off the car

38
00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:04.910
Send me someone to save me

39
00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:12.560
