00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.410
Hey!

2
00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:04.950
What are you doing!

3
00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.060
There was really something in this box that day!

4
00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:08.660
Yes yes yes!

5
00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.200
Brother, I asked him, go call the police!

6
00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:13.060
Damn it! If you call the police, won't they be called?

7
00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.600
If you ask this question, I don’t know why I’m going to stop doing it. I’m not going to do it anymore!

8
00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:18.260
Then honestly why do you want to sing?

9
00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:19.720
It's just that he recently defrauded me of a car...

10
00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.720
Why am I cheating on my car? Don’t think I don’t know

11
00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:24.020
It’s all in your box!

12
00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.040
When did I become so pretentious?

13
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.480
This is a box of books!

14
00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:31.750
What? You’re also pretending to be a book!

15
00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:35.020
Just not very healthy

16
00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:37.430
If you say he is an uncle, then he is an uncle

17
00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:38.430
How old is your mother?

18
00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.470
Second miscellaneous leader, see for yourself

19
00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:45.230
Can you push it back a bit?

20
00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:46.230
The only one I really found was with me
