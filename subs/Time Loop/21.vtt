00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:08.180
I'll go over there and have a look. Nothing over there.

2
00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:11.170
Didn't you say before that after inspection, you didn't believe there was no bomb?

3
00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.550
Could it be that the bomb was in the car?

4
00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:17.940
Not likely. Just blow it up so big.

5
00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:20.040
At least seven kilograms of online explosives are required.

6
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.440
Passengers carry small bags with their shoes.

7
00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:25.560
It shouldn't be in the car. What if it was a professional bomb.

8
00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.420
Professional ones are unlikely. Professionals require four kilograms online.

9
00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.460
Not in the car either. That's assuming the bomb isn't in the car.

10
00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:35.520
It's outside. Tell me,

11
00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.200
Buy it in advance outside. If purchased in advance.

12
00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.900
That explosion should have come from bottom to top.

13
00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:43.100
Does it look like the place just now?

14
00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:48.360
Do you still remember?

15
00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:50.760
There is a man on the outside to my left

16
00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.160
You have been holding a big cake

17
00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:53.830
I recalled it

18
00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:55.290
Very nervous expression

19
00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:56.850
Always holding a big cake

20
00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:59.330
Could it be that he really is?

21
00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:01.470
There is obviously air next to him

22
00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:03.280
Why are you holding him?

23
00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.300
This is the strangest thing

24
00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:08.980
Could it be that the hands belong to that big cake?
