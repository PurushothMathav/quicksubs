00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:02.830
It could be someone else. Is it you?

2
00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:05.070
It's really not me. Why did I need that car?

3
00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:06.930
Not you. It could also be your accomplice.

4
00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:09.810
My buddies were all killed. He blew himself up.

5
00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:12.810
Then why are you robbing. Who told you I was going to rob?

6
00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:15.730
Not a robbery. Why are you cooperating with the driver to stop?

7
00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:18.710
Of course I have my own things to do. cycle several times.

8
00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.960
All because of the explosion. So what you were trying to do didn't work, right?

9
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.380
How could I still be here if I succeeded?

10
00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:26.360
Then let's work together. How to cooperate.

11
00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:28.380
You tell me what you want to do first.

12
00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:32.270
I didn't get in the car.

13
00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:34.390
To explain a person who goes first

14
00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:37.010
The male Boss Ma is right behind him

15
00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:38.520
Why don't you know him?

16
00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:40.070
He lied to us

17
00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:41.880
Talk about specific examples

18
00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:45.340
Too many people and too many jobs

19
00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:46.860
Go to my place and talk

20
00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:48.340
before us

21
00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:49.740
I got a shareholder with continuous value

22
00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:50.900
Boss Ma wants to do it

23
00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:53.400
Just send someone to trade with us, who knows?

24
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.180
He turned over the shareholders

25
00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:56.980
So you guys know Boss Ma

26
00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:58.580
Just to let him take over the main shareholders

27
00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:59.140
Return it to you

28
00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:01.730
The man behind me

29
00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:02.910
If you were a big boss

30
00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.230
Why do we need to take a bus?

31
00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:05.610
Can't you drive by yourself?

32
00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:07.070
I've been investigating him for a long time

33
00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:08.730
His lover outside is pregnant

34
00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:09.970
Afraid of being discovered

35
00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:11.670
So I had to arrange it in the countryside.

36
00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.550
If he drives by himself

37
00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:14.950
If the target is too big, it will explode easily.

38
00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:16.250
I can only take this train.

39
00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.200
Then since you want to cooperate with Boss Ma

40
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.520
Next time the bear is ruthless

41
00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:21.840
Wouldn't it be over if we just tied him up?

42
00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.370
But you have to do me a favor
