00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:05.060
Since you know the truth, why don't you just tell us?

2
00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:08.240
I should have told you directly,

3
00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:10.520
It was my fault.

4
00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:12.520
Brother, he is the biggest loser in everything.

5
00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:16.820
Even if my wife tells you, they will find other ways to succeed.

6
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.060
Yes. solutions to problems,

7
00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.700
Not blow him up. Taking advantage of innocent people.

8
00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.440
Who said I was going to blow up the car?

9
00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:26.980
Wouldn't it be easier for him to blow up this beast?

10
00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.940
My bomb can only hit people,

11
00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.840
It wouldn't kill anyone, let alone leave such a big car behind.

12
00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:34.660
Sure enough, two bombs were used

13
00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:37.140
How did that car explode?

14
00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.090
There's another bomb

15
00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:44.620
Just fry it slowly

16
00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:46.880
I even got off the car and there are

17
00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.800
You guys from the bottom of society

18
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.000
Living is also a punishment

19
00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:53.270
Write a book for my son

20
00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:57.980
Is your Rong Xing Lu Sheng

21
00:00:57.980 --> 00:00:59.540
You harmed many daughters

22
00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:00.600
You must die well

23
00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:13.680
We are optimistic enough

24
00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:15.440
No one is getting off the bus

25
00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:25.370
Who has a bomb up there?

26
00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:26.410
I put it there

27
00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:29.940
This bus company didn't want to take me there

28
00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:31.420
Still too tender

29
00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.770
I belong to Dao San

30
00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:39.930
Just go to hell
