00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.620
He broadcast a message that the station had just received.

2
00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:12.180
Three o'clock this afternoon. I am Dongfeng Lu.

3
00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.280
A serious bus explosion occurred.

4
00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:16.180
One horse was injured in the accident.

5
00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:20.200
The specific casualties and causes of the incident are under investigation.

6
00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.590
In other words, there may be nails in the car that are bombs.

7
00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:11.060
This is the last time

8
00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:12.620
Then everyone will die

9
00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:14.900
I have to find a way to get everyone off the bus

10
00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:19.400
Why don't you go and sit down?

11
00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.800
Wife, this bus city is about to explode.

12
00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:22.800
We need to get off the bus quickly

13
00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:23.900
What did you say

14
00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.940
These two buses are three o'clock long and will explode on time.

15
00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:28.320
Sit down quickly

16
00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.800
Be careful if people say you are spreading rumors. Call the police and arrest you.

17
00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:31.680
everyone listen to me

18
00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.420
This bus city is about to explode

19
00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.600
We need to get off the bus quickly

20
00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:39.760
what i said is true

21
00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:41.990
Are so many people going to die together?

22
00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:43.090
You obviously know panic

23
00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:44.930
How many years have we been running around town?

24
00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:45.770
Nothing ever happened

25
00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:47.470
I said, is there something wrong with your brain?

26
00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:48.790
You said you are used to not bandaging

27
00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.530
What kind of medicine is there?

28
00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:51.470
Just open your mouth and come

29
00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:52.450
Can't scare anyone

30
00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:53.650
Sorry, everyone

31
00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:55.390
Husband Wen was fine last night.

32
00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:56.430
Let’s figure it out

33
00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:57.690
Sit tight in your seat

34
00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:58.510
I want to influence everyone

35
00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:01.030
Okay, I'll come here first and let him take a seat.

36
00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:03.400
Wife, don’t you believe me too?

37
00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:04.960
This city is about to explode

38
00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:06.080
we all have to die

39
00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:07.680
You study the beast zone every day

40
00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.160
Do the math, make a car pinch

41
00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:10.919
Now that I hear the speed, I verbally

42
00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:12.620
Have you forgotten why we divorced?

43
00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.420
Let's get a divorce, okay

44
00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:27.380
You have studied mathematics for ten years

45
00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:36.950
I keep telling myself

46
00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.720
You have literature and knowledge

47
00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.420
I'm lucky to be able to like me

48
00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:42.050
That's why I became successful

49
00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:45.220
But now you can't succeed

50
00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:48.290
I've already packed my luggage. It scares me.

51
00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:49.990
I'll take Xiaoxue back to my house

52
00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:52.350
We will complete the procedures next week

53
00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:55.220
You bought this house before you got married

54
00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.720
you believe me

55
00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:05.980
What should I do this time?

56
00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:07.350
Everything can't be done

57
00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:08.140
Cold wedding, come out

58
00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:09.780
I've done everything

59
00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:10.780
What happened next

60
00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:11.680
I own everything second hand
