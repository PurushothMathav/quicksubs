00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.009
Who are you exactly? What do you say?

2
00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:04.280
I don't quite understand. you,

3
00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:10.300
You are gamblers and gamblers.

4
00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:11.360
Don't let me drive again.

5
00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:14.020
you. Do you believe it too?

6
00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:17.200
Me, my wife and kids are still in the car. If you don't go down.

7
00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:18.520
I don't say anything to them.

8
00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:21.970
Why are you staring? What are you doing? Woe to me. Harao!

9
00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:24.710
Wife, my stomach feels a little uncomfortable and I am choking.

10
00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:26.570
Ah...? How can you be so?

11
00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:27.050
A Filipino supervisor like Jean esmerus?

12
00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:34.670
What does calling you have to do with repayment?

13
00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:35.770
Aren't you a healer?

14
00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:37.170
Why do they want you to get off the bus?

15
00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.610
Who is with them?

16
00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.110
Is there something wrong with your brain?

17
00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.170
They were the ones who kicked you out of the car

18
00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:45.430
It's obvious that we are afraid that we can prevent the car from exploding.

19
00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:46.710
They are the murderers

20
00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:47.950
Don't think about angering me suddenly

21
00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:48.770
If you don't feel guilty

22
00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:50.490
Why are you disturbing my brother?

23
00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:51.950
Are you overacting?

24
00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:53.730
When did I bother you?

25
00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.230
It doesn't matter if you're not an adult

26
00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.670
Do you dare to go there with me?

27
00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:57.930
The train to Buda started and then exploded

28
00:00:59.170 --> 00:00:59.390
Your suspicion will be dispatched

29
00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:00.830
I'll go with you
