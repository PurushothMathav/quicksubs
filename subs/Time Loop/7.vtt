00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:02.330
Do you know how to drive? How do you park your car?

2
00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:04.420
The car broke down. Brother driver,

3
00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:05.140
What's wrong?

4
00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:14.400
Come here. What do you want to do?

5
00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:17.410
Is this not accurate? No.

6
00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:18.770
That's right, it's me and you.

7
00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:24.020
What's your name?

8
00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:26.560
Zhang...see me.

9
00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:31.120
Come on, pass first. go down,

10
00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:32.540
Get your suitcase over here.

11
00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.020
What are you doing with my suitcase?

12
00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:36.960
In your suitcase, please return your luggage.

13
00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:38.560
Dahua Life

14
00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:43.300
Is this clothes packed?

15
00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:45.960
These four pounds of brain

16
00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:47.940
It's so good. Hurry up.

17
00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:50.160
The guy asked us to go down and get it ourselves.

18
00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:56.960
That's nothing like this

19
00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.330
This, this brother

20
00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:00.490
Just inside

21
00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:01.510
The yellow box

22
00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:03.720
I didnâ€™t know that was my box

23
00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:06.300
Don't worry about how I know yes

24
00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:07.900
Look at this box

25
00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:08.860
See enough

26
00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:10.240
There's a lot of stuff inside

27
00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:11.220
Can it be done?

28
00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:17.380
Take a look

29
00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.460
Yes, this is a lighter matter. Why do you hurry up and compose the lyrics?
