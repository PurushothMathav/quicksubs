00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.550
The scene of car fraud. It's him. that is.

2
00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:06.140
Ask for this thing. He is the scene of murder. My wife and kids are in the car.

3
00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:08.690
I cheated on my car. Then who knows.

4
00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:11.390
You might. you. You bought insurance for your wife.

5
00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:13.350
Want to cheat. Comrade police.

6
00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.090
If the murderers are not the two of them. Why did he run away?

7
00:00:16.329 --> 00:00:18.790
Let's take a good walk on the road. It depends on your car Baoza.

8
00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:20.950
It's almost up to you. Then why are you running?

9
00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.370
His brother. Is this a normal human reaction?

10
00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:25.750
that is. Comrade police.

11
00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:28.250
There is a process between this person. I even had a fight with him.

12
00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.170
Then he detonated the bomb. He but you are dreaming.

13
00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:32.630
I've never been in that car

14
00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:35.190
Now that I don’t know how to drive, I can even change it myself.

15
00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.510
The police won't believe it either

16
00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.520
I saw two people on the road before

17
00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:39.380
It's you

18
00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:41.040
Team White, fix us

19
00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.640
We Lancar fans stop by

20
00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:44.260
Just keep moving forward.

21
00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:44.940
Stop talking

22
00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:46.440
You guys should go first too, right?

23
00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:47.310
police comrade

24
00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:48.380
They are cultivators

25
00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:49.360
Can't let them go

26
00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.420
The two of them are used to having trouble with their heads.

27
00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:52.650
Let them drive away

28
00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:53.920
I guess I don't have the guts

29
00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.760
You go too, brother

30
00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:02.340
Why is it you

31
00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:03.800
Farewell Lord Ding

32
00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.060
It’s really not my Chad car

33
00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:07.100
I and the others are about to collapse.

34
00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:08.020
I'm the same as you

35
00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:09.160
It’s been repeated many times
