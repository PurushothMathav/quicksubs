00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:12.000
Dad, who are you trying to trick?

2
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:17.430
Where can dad recruit? Let's catch that person this time.

3
00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:20.790
Be sure to shrink him down well. Sorry first, it looks like Ding Lei.

4
00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:21.530
I won’t help you.

5
00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:25.520
Those who are about to get off the bus will follow. It really doesn’t stop after passing this station.

6
00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:32.270
He didn't show up this time.

7
00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:37.020
It should also be caught in a cycle.

8
00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:39.500
But if he is the murderer,

9
00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.950
How can I fix the car without getting in the car?

10
00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:45.530
If he is not the murderer, does it make sense?

11
00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:47.230
If he is not the murderer

12
00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:48.710
Then why did the car explode before?

13
00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:50.390
Including his damn sales

14
00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:52.940
Could it be that my reasoning was wrong?

15
00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.620
Does he just want to get out of the loop?

16
00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.450
The real murderer is not him

17
00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:01.220
It shouldn't be that simple

18
00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:02.700
I want to see this time

19
00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:04.239
Will it explode?

20
00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:06.930
It's a dangerous car. Get in the car quickly.

21
00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.270
The car is about to explode

22
00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:09.130
I want to get off
