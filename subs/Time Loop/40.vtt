00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.460
How did you tell? It's okay for us to get off the bus.

2
00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:05.240
Your accomplice. The shoe-toothed boss just got out of the car.

3
00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:07.480
It's not obvious enough that the car exploded both at once and twice.

4
00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:11.600
But when the murderer comes, Boss Ma will not let him get out of the car.

5
00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:13.540
Who wants to kill Boss Ma?

6
00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:15.740
One bomb, but two more are needed to kill a single person.

7
00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:18.220
As for who is looking for Boss Ma?

8
00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:19.420
This is something we want to investigate.

9
00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:21.170
I paid you to investigate

10
00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:23.480
I almost collapsed

11
00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:24.740
He is the boss of Hengsheng Group

12
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:27.780
I can't afford to throw it away. I can't afford to hide it. I'm throwing it away.

13
00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:36.100
Then I have to go to No. 3 Elementary School

14
00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:38.500
Go ask you about Wu Tiantian, right?

15
00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:40.300
You and I have forgotten about this. Come on.

16
00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:44.720
Coming out soon

17
00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:45.780
Go and take a look

18
00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.520
Is anyone following us Haochener?

19
00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:55.920
Our Tiedang is really missing, right?

20
00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:57.480
If you get angry, he will come running over.

21
00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:58.280
Is there something wrong?

22
00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.020
I'm far away from groupthink

23
00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:02.240
Easier and faster for you

24
00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:03.720
You want to give it to me for free?

25
00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:05.640
as long as you tell me

26
00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.000
When Wu Tiantian had a fever

27
00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.380
Who sent Wu Tiantian to the hospital?

28
00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:11.000
Which hospital were you sent to?

29
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.940
What do you think this is for?

30
00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:12.740
Then leave it alone

31
00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:14.360
I avoid this idea of ​​disintegration

32
00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:19.000
It's definitely beneficial for you to be called Ping, but you didn't say it

33
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:19.860
If it's not me, I can leave

34
00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.240
Wu Tiantian’s class master Zhao Feifei

35
00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.160
First, he was sent to a nearby hospital.

36
00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.380
Later God transferred him to Tianji Hospital
