00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:02.570
I went there relatively early, and there happened to be no one on the bus.

2
00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:04.950
I jumped and exploded the secret weapon.

3
00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:08.610
After I got off the horse, I sat in that position as expected.

4
00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:11.580
I sat next to it to prevent it from getting out of control.

5
00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:13.980
So, when you see my head and want to get off,

6
00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:15.100
You will also detonate bombs.

7
00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:17.200
That's right, when your wife sat at the door,

8
00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:19.860
I will set off a bomb. I'm in a loop,

9
00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.480
But only once, when your wife got out of the car,

10
00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:24.880
I detonated the bomb. You have detonated it before,

11
00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:26.380
It's just that you don't remember.

12
00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:27.760
It's really like Dabai

13
00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.360
Although you think about the power of your bomb

14
00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:30.900
But detonated his bomb

15
00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.880
That's why I blew up the whole car.

16
00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:34.500
What you said is right

17
00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:36.260
I admit this

18
00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:37.740
Can you let my son go?

19
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.340
I had no intention of arriving, your son.

20
00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:42.360
These miserable and unforgivable things you did

21
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:45.680
Leave it to the law and ask me to tell you

22
00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:46.780
Let's get off first

23
00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:47.900
tie him to the car

24
00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:48.880
Blow up the car

25
00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:50.940
It's no better than being blown up together with him.

26
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:52.580
Donâ€™t blow up a big car

27
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.860
If the car explodes

28
00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:54.860
We will still cycle

29
00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:01.040
Don't you think it was an advantage to blow him up? Okay? Kill this beast with a gift.

30
00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:08.460
If you don't want to show up outside the room,

31
00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:09.140
You can do it

32
00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:11.190
I won't tell you. Ye Cha is right.
