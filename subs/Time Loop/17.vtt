00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:05.320
Now is the ninth time to talk. Nine minutes ahead of time.

2
00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:07.890
The time is advanced by one minute each time the call is sought.

3
00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:09.980
And put it on everyone’s forehead,

4
00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.180
Asked several times. That uncle.

5
00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.980
That uncle. Do you see how many times I have it on my forehead?

6
00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:19.350
No. Did you calculate the magic test?

7
00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.380
In other words, admitting that everyone is looking for words.

8
00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:27.880
Only those who know what they are looking for can see the number on other people's foreheads.

9
00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:36.870
People who don’t know what they are looking for can’t tell. That uncle.

10
00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:45.930
There was one person who I remember saying hello to. Then here shouted.

11
00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:54.620
Achievement line. Got off the bus.

12
00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:03.470
Non-stop. Bo.

13
00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:04.170
I want to get off.

14
00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:05.720
Please open the luggage rack

15
00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:06.580
I take the magnetic box

16
00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:08.140
I'll get it for you

17
00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:19.310
Don't move again

18
00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:20.590
What are you afraid of?

19
00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:23.180
how do you know

20
00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:23.880
That's what I still think about

21
00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:26.160
That person before

22
00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:27.160
Probably not the murderer

23
00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:28.810
He might jump out of Xu Hua

24
00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:30.010
Not on the car

25
00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:31.620
Not a murderer

26
00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:34.410
Do you know why the car exploded before?

27
00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:35.970
Do you have anything sharp on your body?
