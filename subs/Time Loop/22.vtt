00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.170
This cake is so big, it is entirely possible to put explosives in it.

2
00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:05.420
How did I wire this person before?

3
00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.730
If there's nothing wrong with the cake, why is it still so nervous with its expression on its face?

4
00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:12.770
You're sure it's nervous. right,

5
00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:15.610
I was very nervous, holding the cake tightly with both hands,

6
00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:18.510
There is definitely something wrong. So this person is very suspicious?

7
00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:20.510
It must be it, the cake is so big,

8
00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:24.270
Explosives were hidden, no one knew. Then the next time we travel back in time,

9
00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:27.330
Join forces to put the adults in uniform, open the cake and take a look,

10
00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:30.730
There is no problem. But these are just suspicions.

11
00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:32.130
Also the little brother's improvement

12
00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:33.670
I'll go check out the small house nearby

13
00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:34.670
You two wait for me here
