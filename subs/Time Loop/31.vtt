00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:05.570
Didn't see it. The car still exploded.

2
00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:08.370
I'm always with you. How could it be me.

3
00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:10.570
Are you really following them?

4
00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:13.150
It must be them. Isn’t this sensible?

5
00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:23.780
Zhou Ming. Teacher Che. Zhou Ming.

6
00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.080
Teacher Che. The car was still damaged.

7
00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.440
What is the direction of the car? protein hat man,

8
00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.560
Not a quickie. After they kicked you and Li Xiaofeng out of the car,

9
00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.620
It’s about grabbing festivals. They all told me about the car in front of me.

10
00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.440
Come quickly. good. good.

11
00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:38.860
Zhou Iron is moving, Zhou Iron is moving. Done,

12
00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:40.720
Done. Grab a festival.

13
00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:52.240
Let me go.

14
00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:56.920
Hurry up and get them both in, don't let them explode all the way up.

15
00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:58.400
What to do if you call the police

16
00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:59.820
Just trade and trade.

17
00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:03.260
Are they allowed to continue robbing?

18
00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:26.060
It's impossible

19
00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.900
under their emotions

20
00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:27.640
A bomb was reported

21
00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:29.100
Both men were subdued

22
00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.380
So-called being held down

23
00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:31.680
man in white hat

24
00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.300
There was no chance of reporting a bomb

25
00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:34.720
That means the murderer has money.

26
00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.020
As long as someone gets off the bus

27
00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:37.040
Will report the bomb
