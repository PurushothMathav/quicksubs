1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.500
This is my second cycle.

2
00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:03.780
Then why is it me in the book above?

3
00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:07.700
I cycled five times without straps and I knew from the start that I was looping.

4
00:00:08.119 --> 00:00:10.540
It was only from this time that I had the memory of the last time.

5
00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:13.500
Then you should leave in a month. Maybe as long as I'm dressed up at the station,

6
00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:17.390
You can get out of the cycle. I feel like no matter where I am,

7
00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:20.490
Sooner or later, I will return to the car and enter the wireless cycle.

8
00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.510
Teacher Chen, did you get off the car to waste time?

9
00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.890
The name of the poem, followed by the explosions, are all three-year-long explosions.

10
00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:28.890
I need to confirm that the time is correct? It seems like there is something explosive in the title of the poem.

11
00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.110
Then why not call the police?

12
00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:31.510
I reported it before

13
00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:32.470
This place is too remote

14
00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:33.490
The police can't even afford to come and pay back the debt.

15
00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:35.090
The power of the previous explosion has increased

16
00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:36.330
Blow back the entire carriage

17
00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:37.890
At least seven kilograms of bombs are required

18
00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:38.810
I'll check

19
00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:40.370
Pay attention to your safety and check with the teacher

20
00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:43.690
I took it out without waiting.

21
00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:44.970
Too many things

22
00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.100
Here, take the bomb

23
00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:54.670
Is it really a bomb? This teacher?

24
00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:56.310
Can't you take it out?

25
00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:57.410
keep imaginary people

26
00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:58.270
Can't lift it anymore

27
00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:02.500
found the bomb

28
00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:03.180
Letâ€™s think about the car now
