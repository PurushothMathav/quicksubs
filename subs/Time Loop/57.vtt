00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.280
Because you are the only one who has cycled, and I have also cycled.

2
00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:05.500
You still have to die this time,

3
00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.670
Tianmen parking. Good car reservations are available early in the morning.

4
00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:18.620
Ouch, please step back,

5
00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:31.710
Otherwise, just stop.

6
00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:34.430
There are bombs available, I will start now,

7
00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:36.230
No one can get off the bus. otherwise,

8
00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:37.640
Please report the bomb.

9
00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.740
Your car blew up,

10
00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:43.570
You can also end up in an endless cycle yourself.

11
00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:45.490
No one can escape, including you.

12
00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:50.130
Car, you have to meet the person who blew up the whole car,

13
00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.830
There is also the human heart. i happen

14
00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:54.850
Smelling the roots shows that it is harmful to you

15
00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:56.570
Still lying in the hospital now

16
00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:58.740
You won't hit the car anymore

17
00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:00.240
Don't get off the car

18
00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:01.330
Stand together and die together

19
00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:04.250
Your daughter was also killed by her

20
00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:06.200
Then why did you stop me?

21
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.810
I want her to die

22
00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:10.230
As long as you start the car, it will explode.

23
00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:12.640
She will kill you if she doesn't

24
00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:14.520
I have no idea who the murderer is

25
00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:17.680
Your purpose is just to make her die to her

26
00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.360
I just want her to die

27
00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:20.860
i follow you

28
00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:22.700
I'm just afraid that you might cause an explosion

29
00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:37.820
Stop talking nonsense

30
00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:39.300
Then you are all dead

31
00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:40.640
I'm alone

32
00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.360
Maybe I'll break out of the cycle

33
00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.620
You are too generous

34
00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:46.000
I'm glad this is your first level private law
