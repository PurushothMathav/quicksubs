00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:02.266
You helped me with the guild mission

2
00:00:02.266 --> 00:00:04.200
Do you know how much I'm short?

3
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.066
900,000 can you afford it?

4
00:00:08.066 --> 00:00:11.100
900,000 how much money I thought I had

5
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:14.266
Don't worry, I'll get 900,000 and PK for you.

6
00:00:14.266 --> 00:00:15.800
Xiaoya, don't worry.

7
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.533
I don't know about other aspects.

8
00:00:17.533 --> 00:00:19.766
The money is definitely not going

9
00:00:19.766 --> 00:00:21.400
Are you serious?

10
00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:24.566
Add WeChat

11
00:00:24.966 --> 00:00:27.933
Just tell me what time you usually go LIVE

12
00:00:27.933 --> 00:00:30.033
Most of the IDs are live.

13
00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.800
It usually looks like eight or nine o'clock.

14
00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.766
ID is called a Xiaoya

15
00:00:36.133 --> 00:00:38.300
I'll be on time at 9 o'clock tomorrow night

16
00:00:38.466 --> 00:00:40.033
The rain seems to have stopped.

17
00:00:40.166 --> 00:00:41.633
Then I'll go back first.

18
00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.866
Linger, do you think your husband is really that rich?

19
00:00:52.566 --> 00:00:54.433
He's not my husband yet

20
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.800
If you have money or not, you will know when you see it tomorrow.

21
00:00:57.866 --> 00:01:00.200
You are all mysterious

22
00:01:00.766 --> 00:01:04.466
I'd like to see who it is

23
00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.500
Brothers are helping Xiaoya

24
00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.100
Walk over the opposite side

25
00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:18.566
Xiaoya

26
00:01:18.566 --> 00:01:20.166
I've given you gifts for my living expenses this month.

27
00:01:20.166 --> 00:01:21.600
But recently, a big brother can't beat it.

28
00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.200
Can't beat it at all

29
00:01:23.766 --> 00:01:26.700
It seems that this month's task is really hanging in the balance
