00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:01.700
Ok ok ok

2
00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:03.766
I see, good boss.

3
00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:06.133
The secretary of the president of Shangguan Group just called

4
00:00:06.133 --> 00:00:08.066
The Shangguan family has agreed for me to cooperate with you

5
00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:11.433
How is the comparison between Shangguan Group and Xiao Family?

6
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.833
The Shangguan family who owns the Shangguan Group call me far red

7
00:00:15.866 --> 00:00:18.133
Although slightly uglier than the Xiao family

8
00:00:18.133 --> 00:00:20.900
But it's also one of the top competitors in the world.

9
00:00:21.166 --> 00:00:24.800
Very good, if you can cooperate with Shangguan Group

10
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.000
Just a few more words to deal with the Xiao family

11
00:00:27.366 --> 00:00:29.700
Yes, let me take a look for you.

12
00:00:31.066 --> 00:00:32.766
This is the president of Shangguan Group

13
00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.633
What about Shangguan Yarou?

14
00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:37.233
It is pretty

15
00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:38.800
But it's just a little chilly

16
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.100
Then you hurry up and send someone to talk about cooperation.

17
00:00:41.366 --> 00:00:42.266
Ok boss

18
00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.366
I'll do it now.

19
00:00:43.366 --> 00:00:46.700
Muse bound successfully target Shangguan Yarou

20
00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:48.733
Can trigger hidden reward strategy

21
00:00:48.733 --> 00:00:51.100
Success will get 10x refund.

22
00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:51.900
What!

23
00:00:52.466 --> 00:00:53.500
10 times

24
00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.633
Ah, I just remembered.

25
00:00:58.933 --> 00:01:02.100
This is such an important collaboration that I should go in person

26
00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:04.700
Come on, give me the address.

27
00:01:04.866 --> 00:01:05.933
How did you send it so fast?

28
00:01:05.933 --> 00:01:08.000
Oops, send me the address.

29
00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:09.366
Go first

30
00:01:09.933 --> 00:01:11.666
Hello, I'm looking for a project to ask you.

31
00:01:11.766 --> 00:01:13.666
Do you have a date?

32
00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.500
There should be, what do you mean should?

33
00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.266
Did you go back and figure it out?

34
00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.600
Do you think our president Shangguan is very idle?

35
00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:21.833
Anyone can see
