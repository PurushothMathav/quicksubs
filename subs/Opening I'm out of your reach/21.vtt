00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:03.333
Thank You Dog for 10 Carnivals

2
00:00:03.333 --> 00:00:05.400
Dog brother loves you

3
00:00:06.566 --> 00:00:07.566
Brother Dog

4
00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:11.300
When did I change this ID?

5
00:00:11.333 --> 00:00:13.466
Master, I changed it for you.

6
00:00:13.466 --> 00:00:14.500
Isn't that appropriate?

7
00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:15.966
I post your brother-in-law

8
00:00:16.533 --> 00:00:17.333
This

9
00:00:17.366 --> 00:00:20.133
Don't the whole live stream only know that I am simp?

10
00:00:20.133 --> 00:00:21.566
Is the king of simp

11
00:00:22.466 --> 00:00:23.266
that

12
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:24.500
Not yet.

13
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.666
The number of gifts for Brother Dog is not enough.

14
00:00:27.666 --> 00:00:29.966
Can you help Xiaoya again?

15
00:00:30.166 --> 00:00:31.033
Ah!

16
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.366
I'm exhausted.

17
00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.200
Finally rushed in

18
00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.366
Play PK now.

19
00:00:37.733 --> 00:00:39.000
Is it a problem?

20
00:00:40.266 --> 00:00:42.166
I didn't watch and missed 1,000 carnivals

21
00:00:42.366 --> 00:00:42.900
aunt

22
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.300
Whose heroic girl is this 3 million?

23
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.033
That's pretty cool.

24
00:00:47.166 --> 00:00:49.733
Thank you, Brother Dog, for 1,000 carnivals.

25
00:00:49.733 --> 00:00:51.800
Brother Dog, let's add a friend

26
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.800
Aren't we friends anymore?

27
00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:00.833
How did it go?

28
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:02.433
This compensation

29
00:01:02.866 --> 00:01:04.066
Are you still satisfied?

30
00:01:04.533 --> 00:01:07.700
This hero is actually you
