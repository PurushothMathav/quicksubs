00:00:00.866 --> 00:00:01.733
What's wrong?

2
00:00:01.733 --> 00:00:02.733
What's wrong with you talking nicely?

3
00:00:02.733 --> 00:00:03.766
The group is responsible for real estate

4
00:00:03.766 --> 00:00:05.900
The three core teams of entertainment media and the Internet

5
00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:06.766
Suddenly jumped ship

6
00:00:06.766 --> 00:00:08.800
Several big heads naturally already know about this

7
00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.133
We thought there was a change in the group

8
00:00:10.133 --> 00:00:11.066
divestment

9
00:00:11.133 --> 00:00:12.633
Group capital chain broken

10
00:00:12.666 --> 00:00:13.700
It's bankrupt

11
00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:15.166
Why did they suddenly change jobs?

12
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Give them a raise

13
00:00:17.366 --> 00:00:18.700
We must keep them.

14
00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:20.566
If twice doesn't work, then triple

15
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.700
Chen Tiance, did you do it right?

16
00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.300
It's Yeli

17
00:00:33.766 --> 00:00:35.633
No matter how much you spend

18
00:00:35.766 --> 00:00:36.900
They're not coming back.

19
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:38.500
What did you do?

20
00:00:39.166 --> 00:00:40.166
Nothing.

21
00:00:40.566 --> 00:00:44.000
It is to use the full valuation of your night market group.

22
00:00:44.333 --> 00:00:45.933
Dig them up

23
00:00:45.933 --> 00:00:46.866
In their opinion

24
00:00:46.866 --> 00:00:48.866
Exploited from your side

25
00:00:48.966 --> 00:00:50.500
Isn't that them Yingzi?

26
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:51.766
Tear it all

27
00:00:52.133 --> 00:00:53.266
Can't be true

28
00:00:54.366 --> 00:00:55.833
Not that many.

29
00:00:56.366 --> 00:00:57.433
Just 10 billion
