00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:02.233
Hahahaha

2
00:00:02.366 --> 00:00:05.000
Doctor, your parents saved lives

3
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.666
And you bully the soft and fear the hard for the tiger to make prosperity

4
00:00:08.733 --> 00:00:10.166
You deserve to be an associate dean

5
00:00:10.166 --> 00:00:11.300
Do you deserve to be a doctor?

6
00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:13.800
Where did the little rascal dare to preach to me?

7
00:00:14.133 --> 00:00:17.066
The security quickly kicked them both out for me

8
00:00:17.066 --> 00:00:20.866
Wait, I like to chat with them

9
00:00:20.966 --> 00:00:22.900
You look helpless.

10
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.200
kid

11
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.466
You're so arrogant!

12
00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:30.800
Remember Lin Yuling'er, he didn't have to die

13
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.700
He died because of you

14
00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.700
In the system universal store

15
00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.500
There's no cure for a heart attack.

16
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.466
Super myocardial infarction pills

17
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.766
Just buy 100 million Muse Fund

18
00:00:41.766 --> 00:00:42.966
Just ignore me.

19
00:00:44.133 --> 00:00:46.566
Daughter, don't kneel down to this beast

20
00:00:47.333 --> 00:00:48.666
Hospitals can't cure it

21
00:00:48.766 --> 00:00:50.533
I'll take care of it

22
00:00:50.533 --> 00:00:53.200
What? I heard you right.

23
00:00:53.266 --> 00:00:55.900
Who do you think you are?

24
00:00:56.166 --> 00:00:58.433
Heart infarction patient not dieting surgery

25
00:00:58.466 --> 00:01:00.233
It wouldn't last an hour

26
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.033
Boy, even if you're a doctor, it's too late

27
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.700
Is it true that you can cure it?

28
00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.066
Why should I lie to you?

29
00:01:08.866 --> 00:01:13.066
Others don't mean I can't cure Chen Tianze

30
00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:14.766
You see?

31
00:01:25.266 --> 00:01:28.200
Do you think some broken pill can cure it?

32
00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.333
If he wakes up, I'll kneel down for you

33
00:01:31.333 --> 00:01:32.766
Then you wait to kneel
