00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:01.833
He broke the necklace.

2
00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:03.666
Why did you hit me?

3
00:00:03.666 --> 00:00:06.166
Now this store has been acquired by Mr. Chen

4
00:00:06.166 --> 00:00:07.733
Don't say smashing a necklace

5
00:00:07.733 --> 00:00:10.333
It's okay to smash the whole store

6
00:00:10.333 --> 00:00:12.100
What kind of thing are you?

7
00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:14.500
What is missing from our Mr. Chen?

8
00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:16.766
He really bought our store

9
00:00:17.333 --> 00:00:18.233
Mr. Chen

10
00:00:18.666 --> 00:00:21.333
No, no, Boss Chen, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

11
00:00:21.333 --> 00:00:22.600
I don't know Tarzan

12
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:23.966
I don't know your Buddha

13
00:00:23.966 --> 00:00:25.500
Sorry, sorry.

14
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.666
Now do you still admit it?

15
00:00:28.933 --> 00:00:30.866
You broke this thing.

16
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.800
Boss Chen, please forgive me.

17
00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.666
I'm sorry, I didn't see that you're not a little follower.

18
00:00:35.666 --> 00:00:37.033
Sorry, sorry.

19
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.400
Bite you

20
00:00:39.333 --> 00:00:40.200
Sure

21
00:00:40.766 --> 00:00:41.866
Your whole life

22
00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:45.500
I'll find you when it's over 10 million

23
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.766
And your store manager

24
00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:49.700
You help the curse

25
00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:51.700
You're fired.

26
00:00:52.466 --> 00:00:54.966
Counterfeit, hurry up and get out

27
00:00:56.966 --> 00:00:57.800
Hey, come here

28
00:01:02.566 --> 00:01:03.466
Go ahead.

29
00:01:04.266 --> 00:01:05.200
boss

30
00:01:05.766 --> 00:01:09.100
Is there anything in the store suitable for girls?

31
00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.100
Uh, Boss Chen

32
00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.000
Don't call me boss

33
00:01:13.166 --> 00:01:14.800
You are my boss now

34
00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:15.866
Others have no enemies

35
00:01:15.866 --> 00:01:18.000
I used to do jewelry design

36
00:01:18.166 --> 00:01:19.600
You can call me wife

37
00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.266
If it is a girl

38
00:01:21.266 --> 00:01:23.200
I happen to have a treasure in my hands

39
00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:24.166
One is a store

40
00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:26.300
There should be something, wait a minute.

41
00:01:34.066 --> 00:01:35.366
It's really beautiful

42
00:01:36.066 --> 00:01:36.900
It's expensive.

43
00:01:37.366 --> 00:01:38.966
If money is too cruel

44
00:01:38.966 --> 00:01:40.900
This dead thing is really priceless
