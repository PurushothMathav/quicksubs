00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.966
Little boss, are you serious?

2
00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:06.100
This is a whole villa worth more than 10 billion

3
00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:07.033
seriously

4
00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:08.900
Truer than pearls

5
00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:11.200
So I'll sign it.

6
00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.566
Chizawa, what's wrong with me?

7
00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:15.966
I didn't just say it.

8
00:00:16.066 --> 00:00:18.600
Is this all in your name?

9
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.100
I just thought about it.

10
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.366
You can give these things to others.

11
00:00:22.366 --> 00:00:24.600
If you put all the villas in my name

12
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.966
What if one day I turn my face and don't recognize anyone?

13
00:00:26.966 --> 00:00:28.866
Brother Chizawa, think again

14
00:00:28.866 --> 00:00:29.766
Don't think about it.

15
00:00:30.366 --> 00:00:31.166
Xiaoya

16
00:00:31.733 --> 00:00:33.833
I only have one sentence

17
00:00:34.166 --> 00:00:36.900
I believe that even if I misread

18
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.400
It doesn't matter if you take these away.

19
00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:41.466
10 billion say

20
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:43.466
Nothing to me

21
00:00:43.966 --> 00:00:45.333
OK, I see.

22
00:00:45.333 --> 00:00:47.766
Thank you, Brother Tazawa, for trusting me so much

23
00:00:47.766 --> 00:00:48.933
I will never let you down.

24
00:00:48.933 --> 00:00:53.666
When Song Xiaoya's favorability rose, it was currently only 10 points at 80

25
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:54.266
Never mind.

26
00:00:54.266 --> 00:00:57.800
Better than no rise, my generation still needs to work hard

27
00:00:57.866 --> 00:00:59.000
Hey Xiaoya

28
00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.000
Go now

29
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.200
Are you still satisfied with this little one?

30
00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.233
I am very satisfied

31
00:01:12.533 --> 00:01:13.500
Good idea.

32
00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.433
For the sake of introducing beautiful women to Ben Shao

33
00:01:16.466 --> 00:01:17.533
I'll handle it for you.

34
00:01:17.533 --> 00:01:18.500
I became a genius
