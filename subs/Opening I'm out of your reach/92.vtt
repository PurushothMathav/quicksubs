1
00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.400
Why can't I be here?

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.333
Yarou's birthday party

3
00:00:04.333 --> 00:00:06.533
Can a lowly scumbag like you come?

4
00:00:06.533 --> 00:00:08.266
It polluted the air.

5
00:00:08.333 --> 00:00:11.100
What does it matter to you who I call for my birthday?

6
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:13.166
I didn't ask you what are you doing here?

7
00:00:13.166 --> 00:00:14.600
I'm your fiance?

8
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.233
I even celebrated your birthday at that time

9
00:00:17.166 --> 00:00:18.466
This is me suddenly from South Africa

10
00:00:18.466 --> 00:00:20.000
Dracaena bought by 500 million

11
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.166
If you like it

12
00:00:21.266 --> 00:00:22.500
Make it into ice cream

13
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.366
As expected of Mr. Xiao

14
00:00:24.366 --> 00:00:27.866
As soon as you make a move, it is your unparalleled generosity

15
00:00:29.333 --> 00:00:32.400
Yo, did you buy a gift too?

16
00:00:33.266 --> 00:00:35.100
I don't know where I got it from

17
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.966
The ground will not fall

18
00:00:37.166 --> 00:00:40.400
But I did buy it at a jewelry store

19
00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.300
The jewelry store is at most in the tens of millions

20
00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.233
What do you compare to sales?

21
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.466
People who can compare with sales in Beijing

22
00:00:51.133 --> 00:00:52.566
does not exist

23
00:00:53.133 --> 00:00:54.733
So let's open it up.

24
00:00:54.733 --> 00:00:55.700
What is it?

25
00:00:57.533 --> 00:01:00.066
Yaruo, this is my gift to you.

26
00:01:00.166 --> 00:01:01.233
Galactic Love

27
00:01:01.466 --> 00:01:02.833
Galactic Love

28
00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.066
This is not a top design guru.

29
00:01:05.066 --> 00:01:07.466
A mountain closure without a guardian or a master?
