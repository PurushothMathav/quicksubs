00:00:02.466 --> 00:00:04.300
Ouch, let's feed you

2
00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:05.900
What kind of shit are you talking about?

3
00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:07.833
Chirping like a monkey

4
00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:09.100
I I

5
00:00:09.566 --> 00:00:10.400
Experienced you

6
00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:12.300
Do you know

7
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.500
Tell me if he hurts a hair

8
00:00:15.866 --> 00:00:18.433
Even if I take you apart and put you back together

9
00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:20.900
Burn to ashes and pee Buddha, you can tell the heart

10
00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:22.500
I'll break you a hundred more times

11
00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:23.700
I dare not shoot with you

12
00:00:25.566 --> 00:00:28.300
Dignity, who is he?

13
00:00:29.866 --> 00:00:32.800
He's the new boss of my dynasty

14
00:00:34.866 --> 00:00:37.166
He turned out to be the boss of my Dynasty Entertainment

15
00:00:37.166 --> 00:00:38.833
No wonder they're so rich.

16
00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.500
How can there be such an excellent man?

17
00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.100
I must soak him

18
00:00:44.166 --> 00:00:47.200
I'm going to hit the boss

19
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.200
You're killing me! I... I don't know!

20
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:52.000
If I knew

21
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.733
I wouldn't dare if you gave me a few guts.

22
00:00:53.733 --> 00:00:55.533
Hurry up and apologize to the boss.

23
00:00:55.533 --> 00:00:57.900
If the boss could forgive you, I wouldn't have to die

24
00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:58.700
roll

25
00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:00.400
Don't go anymore

26
00:01:00.566 --> 00:01:01.600
I have someone who can't get up

27
00:01:02.933 --> 00:01:04.000
You treat me like a fart

28
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.700
Let me go, boss, forgive me

29
00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:07.266
Boss, forgive the boss.

30
00:01:07.266 --> 00:01:08.066
Boss Rao

31
00:01:08.466 --> 00:01:10.766
I can spare one of you.

32
00:01:11.333 --> 00:01:14.366
It's up to you to compete with each other

33
00:01:14.866 --> 00:01:16.233
Know what I mean?

34
00:01:17.933 --> 00:01:18.733
dignity

35
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:19.733
There we go.

36
00:01:19.733 --> 00:01:20.533
I still have business to do

37
00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.266
You understand what the boss means.

38
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.333
There is only one life between the two of us

39
00:01:31.333 --> 00:01:34.666
Don't run away, blame it for offending the boss.

40
00:01:34.666 --> 00:01:36.500
I want your life
