00:00:05.333 --> 00:00:06.400
Chizawa brother

2
00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:07.966
Didn't you surprise me?

3
00:00:07.966 --> 00:00:09.666
Why did you bring me here?

4
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.400
You'll know when you go in.

5
00:00:11.866 --> 00:00:14.166
Boss, the boss of this villa area is my friend.

6
00:00:14.166 --> 00:00:15.233
He wants to buy me a cup of tea.

7
00:00:15.466 --> 00:00:16.400
You play here first

8
00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:17.400
I'll come back to you in a while

9
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:18.900
Well, you go ahead.

10
00:00:26.466 --> 00:00:27.866
Oh, my God.

11
00:00:27.866 --> 00:00:30.700
These villas all start at least 50 million

12
00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:33.566
What kind of rich people can afford this?

13
00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.900
Do you like it? I like to send it to you.

14
00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:38.400
That won't work.

15
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.766
You gave me all the shares of the Emgrand Hotel

16
00:00:40.766 --> 00:00:43.600
It would be too much for me to ask for this villa again

17
00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:44.600
Brother Tianzi

18
00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.300
I'm not a gold digger

19
00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.733
Xiaoya, don't say that

20
00:00:48.733 --> 00:00:51.000
Didn't I stand you up yesterday?

21
00:00:51.266 --> 00:00:54.200
Today, I will buy a villa for you as compensation.

22
00:00:54.766 --> 00:00:58.300
I really can't, I didn't worry about that at all

23
00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.000
Yo who is this

24
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.866
Buy a villa as an apology

25
00:01:01.933 --> 00:01:03.566
If I hadn't known you, Chen Tianze

26
00:01:03.566 --> 00:01:05.000
He's a poor worker.

27
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.500
I really thought which Shenhao was standing here

28
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.066
Zhang Qianqian, who is he?

29
00:01:10.066 --> 00:01:12.166
He used to be my supervisor at work

30
00:01:12.533 --> 00:01:14.833
He is a bully who is afraid of the soft and the hard.

31
00:01:14.866 --> 00:01:16.500
I did a lot of housework before.

32
00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.633
I didn't expect me to be here

33
00:01:19.966 --> 00:01:20.933
I didn't think about it either.

34
00:01:20.933 --> 00:01:22.200
Working in an electronics factory

35
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.333
A loser with a monthly salary of 3,000

36
00:01:24.333 --> 00:01:26.700
It can actually appear in this high-end field

37
00:01:27.266 --> 00:01:28.966
Also installed local tyrants to pick up girls

38
00:01:29.066 --> 00:01:30.200
There is really shopping.
