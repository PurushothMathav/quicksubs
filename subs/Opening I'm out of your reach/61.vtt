00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:01.266
Hahahaha

2
00:00:01.933 --> 00:00:03.300
You think too much

3
00:00:03.566 --> 00:00:06.100
I can't stand this simple blow

4
00:00:06.133 --> 00:00:08.766
I, Chen Tianze, will not have where I am today.

5
00:00:08.766 --> 00:00:11.200
It's your sister Xiaoling

6
00:00:11.733 --> 00:00:13.666
If you compensate me for my loss

7
00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:15.700
It's killing my mind.

8
00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:18.533
I can pretend that nothing happened

9
00:00:18.533 --> 00:00:20.633
The woman that Xiao Lingtian likes

10
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:22.200
There is nothing you can't get

11
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.400
Boy, since you don't know how to seize opportunities

12
00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.900
Let's see how you solve these two problems

13
00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.166
A 1 billion loss

14
00:00:30.266 --> 00:00:32.166
The scandal of the hotel

15
00:00:32.333 --> 00:00:34.300
It's kind of human when you think about it.

16
00:00:34.766 --> 00:00:36.466
Is it Xiao Li?

17
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.433
Then keep your eyes open

18
00:00:39.733 --> 00:00:42.433
How did I resolve this loss?

19
00:00:42.566 --> 00:00:45.633
So is the loss of all employees please

20
00:00:46.733 --> 00:00:48.800
A total loss of 1.01 billion

21
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.166
More than two dozen brothers were injured in the fire

22
00:00:51.333 --> 00:00:52.266
Pay millions

23
00:00:52.266 --> 00:00:53.066
polite

24
00:00:53.866 --> 00:00:57.033
My personal assets are over 20 billion

25
00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.600
There's 1.01 billion in that first card.

26
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.466
You go to make up for the loss of the group's deficit

27
00:01:03.866 --> 00:01:06.200
The other one had a billion.

28
00:01:06.366 --> 00:01:08.466
In addition to medical expenses for injured employees

29
00:01:08.666 --> 00:01:11.400
And call each of them 2 million

30
00:01:11.533 --> 00:01:14.833
Don't let injured employees chill their hearts

31
00:01:18.366 --> 00:01:20.066
It seems that you are quite rich

32
00:01:20.066 --> 00:01:23.766
But some things can't be solved with money

33
00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:25.700
I have already told the family of the poisoned person.

34
00:01:26.066 --> 00:01:28.800
The boss behind the dynasty is Emgrand

35
00:01:32.266 --> 00:01:34.466
What do you want to pipe?
