00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:02.466
Yo, what a big breath.

2
00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.600
1 billion so awesome

3
00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:06.900
Why don't you buy the whole building?

4
00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:10.566
Well, that's a good point.

5
00:00:10.566 --> 00:00:12.600
Then the real estate is all-inclusive.

6
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:13.400
Credit.

7
00:00:13.733 --> 00:00:16.066
Brother Kanazawa, you must not go to the head

8
00:00:16.066 --> 00:00:17.666
They are kissing you on purpose

9
00:00:17.666 --> 00:00:20.400
I know you have more than enough money to buy a villa

10
00:00:20.466 --> 00:00:22.400
But all these properties

11
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:23.933
That's an astronomical figure.

12
00:00:23.933 --> 00:00:25.100
You have to calm down!

13
00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:27.100
Don't worry.

14
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.566
Ouch, some people.

15
00:00:29.566 --> 00:00:31.666
It's so big here

16
00:00:31.733 --> 00:00:33.900
Open your mouth and buy the entire real estate

17
00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.400
I'd like to see what you buy today.

18
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:38.700
Hey miss stone

19
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.366
Hurry up and do the math for this gentleman

20
00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:41.800
How much is it going to cost today?

21
00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.133
Our villa

22
00:00:43.133 --> 00:00:46.233
All types taken together are estimated to be 10 billion

23
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:47.966
You wage earner

24
00:00:47.966 --> 00:00:49.333
I advise you

25
00:00:49.333 --> 00:00:51.366
You'd better save it

26
00:00:51.533 --> 00:00:53.366
Otherwise, it will be embarrassing for a while

27
00:00:53.366 --> 00:00:55.000
And 10 billion

28
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.600
He's pretty good with 500 bucks on him

29
00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:59.200
That's ridiculous.

30
00:00:59.333 --> 00:01:01.600
Boy, stop pretending

31
00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.566
Kneel down and apologize now

32
00:01:03.666 --> 00:01:05.600
Give me your woman to play with

33
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.300
I think it's you who should lose money.

34
00:01:07.333 --> 00:01:10.066
10 billion how much money I thought I had

35
00:01:10.066 --> 00:01:11.700
Hurry up and swipe the card and let him swipe

36
00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.366
I'd like to see how much money he can make

37
00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:16.600
insufficient balance
