2
00:00:10.866 --> 00:00:12.233
Not only have money

3
00:00:12.266 --> 00:00:13.366
not heavy

4
00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:16.166
How could there be such a perfect man?

00:00:16.366 --> 00:00:20.200
Song Xiaoya is currently 70 when her liking rises.

Goldman Sachs

00:00:27.066 --> 00:00:28.566
Your men are all down

11
00:00:31.766 --> 00:00:33.666
What's the use of beating?

00:00:33.766 --> 00:00:35.800
I am a shareholder of the Emgrand Hotel

13
00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.766
You hurt my men here

14
00:00:37.766 --> 00:00:39.433
You still want to get out alive?

15
00:00:39.666 --> 00:00:43.433
I'd like to see how many people I can single out

16
00:00:44.333 --> 00:00:46.866
Are you saying you are an Emgrand shareholder?

17
00:00:46.966 --> 00:00:48.866
What? Are you scared?

18
00:00:48.866 --> 00:00:51.800
Hmph now even if you kneel on the ground and beg me

19
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.500
I won't forgive you either.

Please, you deserve it too.

21
00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:59.900
I want to tell you

22
00:01:00.666 --> 00:01:02.433
You are no longer a shareholder

23
00:01:05.566 --> 00:01:06.466
