00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:01.666
It's too expensive

2
00:00:02.766 --> 00:00:03.633
I can't help it.

3
00:00:03.666 --> 00:00:05.333
Boss Chen, this is my designer.

4
00:00:05.333 --> 00:00:07.233
The last work of my career

5
00:00:07.266 --> 00:00:09.200
Of course it's priceless to me

6
00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.200
But I have to keep it for myself and give it to a match.

7
00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:13.233
Because boss you

8
00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:16.233
Only then can his value be fully released, haha.

9
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.100
Galactic Love

10
00:00:19.733 --> 00:00:21.066
I'll take it.

11
00:00:23.333 --> 00:00:26.033
I have 1 billion card

12
00:00:26.733 --> 00:00:29.233
Although not as valuable as Galactic Love

13
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:31.266
But please take it

14
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.633
Ten billion

15
00:00:34.133 --> 00:00:35.200
Where is Shangguan going?

16
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.466
I'm late.

17
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.166
Tianze, you are here, Jia Rou, happy birthday.

18
00:00:42.566 --> 00:00:45.133
Yarou, let me introduce you.

19
00:00:45.133 --> 00:00:46.466
My friend Chen Tianze

20
00:00:46.933 --> 00:00:49.400
Could Chen Tianze be before?

21
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.666
Chen Tianze who made a big deal of the Xiao family auction

22
00:00:52.766 --> 00:00:54.666
Yes, it's mine.

23
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:55.700
Asia

24
00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:58.400
Why would you invite someone like that to your birthday party?

25
00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.233
You don't know that he gave a small discount before.

26
00:01:02.566 --> 00:01:04.800
Who will I call for my birthday to help him eliminate zero days?

27
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:05.700
What's up

28
00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.233
Let's do it first, the Tianze banquet won't start until a while

29
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.300
Yarong, why didn't you call me on your birthday?

30
00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:18.666
I've bought all the gifts for you.

31
00:01:20.466 --> 00:01:22.866
Chen Tianze, why are you here?
