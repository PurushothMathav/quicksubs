1
00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:01.900
Why do you say I can't afford it?

2
00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:03.633
This one is a ruby.

3
00:00:03.666 --> 00:00:06.833
10 million if you can afford it

4
00:00:06.866 --> 00:00:10.433
What are you pretending to be, boss?

5
00:00:10.666 --> 00:00:11.733
Only 10 million

6
00:00:11.733 --> 00:00:13.400
I thought it was how much

7
00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.266
I'll take it.

8
00:00:19.133 --> 00:00:20.366
Ok you sidekick

9
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:21.600
You're finished.

10
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.533
If you don't break this necklace today

11
00:00:23.533 --> 00:00:24.300
Lost money

12
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.733
You're not going to walk out that door.

13
00:00:25.733 --> 00:00:27.000
I smashed it.

14
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.700
You obviously broke it.

15
00:00:31.133 --> 00:00:32.166
What's going on?

16
00:00:32.666 --> 00:00:34.300
It's him he can't afford it

17
00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:37.233
He insisted on touching the necklace of Red Fire and broke him.

18
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.200
It's me who wants to buy cigarettes and won't let me buy them

19
00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:42.366
Also pull me

20
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.566
Obviously you pulled it and smashed it.

21
00:00:44.566 --> 00:00:45.566
You buy

22
00:00:46.133 --> 00:00:47.200
You poor

23
00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.200
Also worthy of a 10 million necklace

24
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.500
If you don't want to be killed by Master Bear

25
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.333
Go home and sell your car and house

26
00:00:53.333 --> 00:00:54.266
This sidekick

27
00:00:54.266 --> 00:00:55.833
Master Xiong is our VIP.

28
00:00:56.266 --> 00:00:57.466
We won't pit you either.

29
00:00:57.466 --> 00:00:58.833
Just at cost

30
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.400
You pay

31
00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.066
5 million it

32
00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:04.966
I didn't smash it, why should I?

33
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.600
And quibble about the security guards?

34
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.000
Take him away
