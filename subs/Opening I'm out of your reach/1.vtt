00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:01.833
Brother, come and catch me

2
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:09.100
Mom?

3
00:00:09.966 --> 00:00:10.966
Ah!

4
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.033
Mom?

5
00:00:19.933 --> 00:00:20.800
doer

6
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.100
How could Chenchen be like this?

7
00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:25.700
Mrs. Ye, please calm down first

8
00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:26.966
The main thing now is

9
00:00:26.966 --> 00:00:28.700
Giving children liver transplants

10
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.333
With my doctor

11
00:00:31.333 --> 00:00:32.600
Not with me

12
00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:33.966
My wife is not well

13
00:00:34.166 --> 00:00:36.066
With my liver

14
00:00:36.066 --> 00:00:37.633
Just my sister doctor

15
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.300
With my liver, oops, listen to me first

16
00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:43.033
Now only Mrs. Ye's liver has been successfully matched

17
00:00:43.566 --> 00:00:44.900
However, due to physical reasons

18
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.466
Mrs. Ye's liver can only save one now

19
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:48.866
How do you want me to choose?

20
00:00:48.866 --> 00:00:50.733
They are all my children. What do you want me to choose?

21
00:00:50.733 --> 00:00:52.033
You tell me.

22
00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.066
aunt

23
00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:55.966
You risk my life to save them, okay?

24
00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.533
Doctor, I'm on my knees for you

25
00:00:58.533 --> 00:01:00.000
Doctor doctor

26
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.266
I beg you.

27
00:01:02.366 --> 00:01:03.366
I beg you.

28
00:01:03.366 --> 00:01:04.200
Doctor

29
00:01:04.766 --> 00:01:05.800
nonsense

30
00:01:09.766 --> 00:01:10.866
What are you waiting for?

31
00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:12.466
Of course I should save my grandson first

32
00:01:14.366 --> 00:01:17.466
Dad, you must have another way

33
00:01:17.966 --> 00:01:19.800
The palms and backs of the hands are full of meat

34
00:01:19.966 --> 00:01:21.700
Student, he is also your biological granddaughter.

35
00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.600
Mom, you can't save your sister like this

36
00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.866
Save sister save sister

37
00:01:28.733 --> 00:01:30.433
Save mom

38
00:01:31.266 --> 00:01:32.566
Just listen to me

39
00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.500
Old boy hahaha

40
00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.100
Hahaha

41
00:01:41.366 --> 00:01:42.800
What are you still doing?

42
00:01:44.733 --> 00:01:49.066
Duo'er Duo'er is gone, Duo'er Duo'er

43
00:01:53.733 --> 00:01:55.600
Duo'er Duo'er

44
00:01:56.133 --> 00:01:57.266
Okay, okay.

45
00:01:57.666 --> 00:01:59.400
The child will belong to someone else sooner or later

46
00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.233
Do you want to have another one later?

47
00:02:06.666 --> 00:02:10.600
Girls must understand

48
00:02:20.933 --> 00:02:22.966
Mrs. Duo'er's mother is here

49
00:02:22.966 --> 00:02:24.066
Don't be afraid of Duo'er

50
00:02:24.366 --> 00:02:25.700
My condolences, Mrs. Ye

51
00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:28.900
Miss is already alive, he can't die

52
00:02:29.133 --> 00:02:30.633
He still smiles like that

53
00:02:30.966 --> 00:02:33.666
He told his mother's hands to chew so sweet

54
00:02:33.866 --> 00:02:35.266
You have to save him.

55
00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:36.266
You have to save him

56
00:02:36.266 --> 00:02:37.200
What are you doing?

57
00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.166
What are you doing with me?

58
00:02:38.166 --> 00:02:39.200
You have to be able to save him.

59
00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:40.366
Mrs. Ye, don't do this

60
00:02:40.366 --> 00:02:41.666
Your wound has opened

61
00:02:41.666 --> 00:02:43.166
You will die if you go on like this

62
00:02:44.866 --> 00:02:46.066
really loyal

63
00:02:46.366 --> 00:02:48.033
Why don't you deal with it quickly?

64
00:02:48.166 --> 00:02:49.000
Yes, yes!

65
00:02:50.066 --> 00:02:50.866
madam

66
00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.266
Ah he he manual he didn't die

67
00:02:54.266 --> 00:02:55.433
He did it manually.

68
00:02:55.566 --> 00:02:58.000
Someone is obsessed, he manually dragged it out quickly

69
00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:00.400
madam

70
00:03:08.733 --> 00:03:09.866
What's wrong wife

71
00:03:15.066 --> 00:03:15.866
madam

72
00:03:17.066 --> 00:03:18.666
Mrs. Wife

73
00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.800
Wife

74
00:03:21.266 --> 00:03:22.700
Mrs. Wife

75
00:03:23.166 --> 00:03:24.366
You wake up you wake up
