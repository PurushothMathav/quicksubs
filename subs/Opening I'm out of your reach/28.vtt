00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:01.033
Wait a minute.

2
00:00:01.966 --> 00:00:04.200
I want you to take him down

3
00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.366
Boss, are you mistaken?

4
00:00:06.366 --> 00:00:07.500
Obviously he made trouble

5
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:08.733
What are you doing with me?

6
00:00:08.733 --> 00:00:09.800
teacher

7
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.033
Mr. Chen has bought Emgrand with 1 billion

8
00:00:14.133 --> 00:00:16.866
100% stake

9
00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:18.600
From now on

10
00:00:18.766 --> 00:00:21.800
He is the Great Forbidden City of Emgrand

11
00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.366
The teacher is you

12
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:28.466
100% stock circle this is impossible

13
00:00:28.866 --> 00:00:30.333
He is a man of this strength

14
00:00:30.333 --> 00:00:32.666
He couldn't have been more noble.

15
00:00:32.666 --> 00:00:35.066
There are people outside the world

16
00:00:35.066 --> 00:00:38.066
Blame it on you for not wanting to see it

17
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.266
Drag him out for me

18
00:00:40.466 --> 00:00:41.266
You don't record

19
00:00:41.566 --> 00:00:44.000
It's the boss coming out

20
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.100
Boss, do you want to figure it out?

21
00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.200
Shut up boss last time?

22
00:00:49.366 --> 00:00:53.033
What? He? He paid 11 for his Emperor.

23
00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.900
What kind of rich man is this?

24
00:00:57.933 --> 00:01:00.466
It's over now, right?

25
00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:03.066
This is for you.

26
00:01:03.766 --> 00:01:05.366
It's no use if I want this

27
00:01:05.766 --> 00:01:08.600
If you don't want it, exchange it for money?

28
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.966
This is 1 billion share

29
00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.100
Send it if you say so.

30
00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.466
It's nothing but 1 billion

31
00:01:16.766 --> 00:01:18.066
If you consider me a friend

32
00:01:18.066 --> 00:01:21.200
I only charge you 1 billion
