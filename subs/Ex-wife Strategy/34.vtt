00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:03.590
Grandpa, this is what I should do.

2
00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:05.750
I was originally worried about singing,

3
00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:08.510
I thought it would be bad to meet face-to-face, but I didn’t expect it.

4
00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:11.530
If you guys come here, I'll be back in two days.

5
00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.270
Don't forget to bring the noodles with you to pick me up.

6
00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:21.370
Ah, then, what nonsense did that woman tell Grandpa that year?

7
00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.920
Missing, the upper part has been taken care of.

8
00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:27.280
During this period, don’t control your water intake.

9
00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:28.300
Yibai no handshake.

10
00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.240
Thank you for saving me one day, before your hand gets better,

11
00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:54.740
I'd do anything for you. anything.

12
00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:58.900
I mean

13
00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:01.020
My cooking skills are pretty good

14
00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.620
If you don't mind

15
00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:04.190
I can deliver food to you

16
00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:07.640
And you are in an inconvenient place

17
00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.100
I can learn everything from teaching

18
00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:13.880
You can do this to someone who cheats on you

19
00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.120
Your husband is wrong

20
00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.460
My husband trusts me and

21
00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:24.600
I won't tell him what happened.

22
00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.160
That man filed for divorce

23
00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:27.720
Still planning to marry him

24
00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:29.120
That being the case

25
00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:31.020
I'll fight for myself for a while

26
00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:32.820
It’s not over seven o’clock majority

27
00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.710
This way I can be with your family, no problem

28
00:01:36.710 --> 00:02:29.660
You don't bully me

29
00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:33.680
Unexpectedly, Fu Yancheng

30
00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:37.200
This guy is even prettier and richer than in the photo

31
00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:39.190
If it weren't for me

32
00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:40.440
How can I even pay for it?

33
00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.980
Maybe I can grant my wish to my wife again

34
00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:43.980
so late

35
00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.280
If you don't stay in the cell and run out with me,

36
00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.540
You successfully tolerated me
