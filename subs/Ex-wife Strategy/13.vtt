00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:02.440
What did you say? What did you say?

2
00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.080
What to say? What to say?

3
00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:06.580
say what?

4
00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:09.040
say what?

5
00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:26.320

9
00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:31.660
say what?

10
00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:31.740
say what?

11
00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:32.080
say what?

12
00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:38.070
say what?

13
00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:38.930
say what?

14
00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:40.270
say what?

15
00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:40.310
say what?

16
00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.570
say what?

17
00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:50.240
say what?

18
00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.480
say what?

19
00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:51.500
say what?

20
00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:52.020
say what?

21
00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:52.040
say what?

22
00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:56.350
say what?

23
00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:28.480
say what?

24
00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:33.580
Don't know, don't know the past

25
00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:35.460
Why send it now?

26
00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:37.360
we can talk business

27
00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:40.840
I didn't expect that he didn't know him either.

28
00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.060
Doing business

29
00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.240
But we treat people

30
00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:46.320
Now you're ready, I don't know

31
00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.080
How many talents are you?

32
00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.160
Is it you

33
00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:54.580
what you are not

34
00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:04.820
Waiting at home

35
00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:05.680
Wait until I finish taking a shower

36
00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:41.450
Besides, clean up and wake up.

37
00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:42.790
You call me Mr. Li immediately

38
00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:44.210
You want me to know myself

39
00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:19.190
Li Marriage doesn’t know

40
00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:24.120
That's why I didn't come down with you.

41
00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:25.800
That's it

42
00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:27.340
I know Ms. Accounting?

43
00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:28.200
It’s been quite a few years

44
00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:31.630
The first time I knew it was Yinhu breaking out

45
00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:33.290
I just said I don’t need money

46
00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:35.390
It turns out that I saw you hurt and called you hurt.

47
00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:38.500
I have lived this kind of woman
