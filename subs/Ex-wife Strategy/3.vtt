7
00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.850
Has my conscience been eaten by a dog?

8
00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.290
You've been married for three years

9
00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:41.570
You didn't introduce me to face

10
00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:43.470
I can't eat it

11
00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:45.770
It happened here

12
00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:48.190
Sure enough, you are becoming, becoming, becoming

13
00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:49.390
Yes What do I want

14
00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.040
On the surface, I have you as a woman

15
00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:02.950
You should not give anything to others, otherwise, otherwise, otherwise, otherwise, what are you doing? Otherwise, Aunt Su

16
00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:04.629
let you down

17
00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:07.130
I'll be the same every penny

18
00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:08.090
I'm not like you

19
00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:09.420
Just give money

20
00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:11.770
Whose message is it that you want your brotherâ€™s legs?

21
00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:14.150
Are you an elder who speaks too independently?

22
00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:19.960
This is not a bit of a naughtiness at all.

23
00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:21.320
The one who needs it is you

24
00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:23.870
If my mother hadn't refused to answer the question

25
00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:25.550
How can there be no family left today?

26
00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.180
If she hadn't died as a soldier

27
00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:29.580
where can i get you

28
00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:32.380
Doing this reminds me of Chang Sulan

29
00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:33.820
What qualifications do you have to give advice?

30
00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.760
What qualifications do you have over my seniors?

31
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:43.480
You guys have seen each other forever, right?

32
00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:45.200
I am willing to write a letter of righteousness

33
00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.080
i can get you

34
00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:53.650
Like your resource goddess at work

35
00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:56.010
What happened to you back then?

36
00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:57.740
Come to my home right away

37
00:01:59.110 --> 00:01:59.530
Know about the divorce

38
00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:01.850
The authorities, you are also because

39
00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:03.110
You and I are no more than an old man

40
00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.040
Now the eye layer is finished. Additional information

41
00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:07.840
So this appends everything

42
00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.259
It's all up to him

43
00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:12.060
I see

44
00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:13.430
I won't say it now

45
00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:15.140
Let you try it

46
00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.300
It balances the identity

47
00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:18.520
Aberdeen football jersey

48
00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:19.600
Not upper eye layer

49
00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:21.610
Deserve better

50
00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:23.950
I've already applied eye layer and it won't change.

51
00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:25.070
He said one bite would make him big

52
00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:29.600
You need to go to the secondary eye level to know

53
00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.800
The person he slept with last night was his wife of more than 5 years

54
00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.020
He has more heart than eating the hidden eyes, right?
