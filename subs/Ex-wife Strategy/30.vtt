00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:05.120
He suddenly grew up like this.

2
00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:08.520
She just kept listening to me. Doesn’t she know who I am?

3
00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:10.340
Come to me to ask questions.

4
00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:17.380
Forget it. Anyway, I’m tired of saying it already. I lied.

5
00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:20.910
Said go. Actually oh wow.

6
00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:26.090
I'm lying to you. In fact, Yijin provides good ones.

7
00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:30.200
My wife’s name is Union,

8
00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:37.010
We will become foreigners.

9
00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:38.710
Because Cheng was drinking fake wine.

10
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.060
I drink him.

11
00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:44.470
have no idea.

12
00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:52.440
When he likes you, that is.

13
00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:52.980
And then it’s all like this,

14
00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.300
She really likes me

15
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.380
Tell me she's really not married

16
00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:58.490
Or my you

17
00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:00.940
Have you ever been married?

18
00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:03.460
Although the results are indeed in the world

19
00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:05.280
She knows everything about her appearance

20
00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:10.660
I'm just admitting it and not leaving

21
00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.160
can i talk to you alone

22
00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:16.830
Some people really take themselves as passing

23
00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:18.090
What do you think?

24
00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.630
Brother Yan Cheng can talk to you about her

25
00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:38.760
My face can help Brother Yan Cheng

26
00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.530
I miss your holiday more than anyone else

27
00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:43.320
I see how much emotion you have

28
00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:51.350
Guaranteed to be called out

29
00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:56.070
What the students want to say is that they don’t do it.

30
00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:58.590
actually i am
