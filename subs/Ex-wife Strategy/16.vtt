00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:48.580
Remember the representative

7
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:00.260
You don't want me, no, no, no, brother

8
00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:02.040
Breaking news

9
00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:03.660
We laugh without understanding

10
00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:04.599
in uri room

11
00:01:04.599 --> 00:01:05.920
Scan and give it to you

12
00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:21.410
I want to see my clothes ripped off and taken away

13
00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:27.750
Are you going to be there?

14
00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:31.030
It's also my own thoughts that are not torn apart.

15
00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:33.690
It was really all a misunderstanding just now

16
00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:38.460
Are others customers or transactions?

17
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.060
You still don't misunderstand

18
00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:48.840
But why is it so big?

19
00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:50.240
Strong cold flying smoke

20
00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:51.360
This kind of thing can be done

21
00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:54.990
I don’t have enough leisure time, so I’m miserable at the station.

22
00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.280
Everything today is all my fault

23
00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:59.990
I'll give you a new room

24
00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:02.510
And your mental damages fee

25
00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:04.370
I'm willing to match them all, right?

26
00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:07.920
Do you think I should have said this before I left?

27
00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.340
What do you remember to pay attention to?

28
00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:11.970
Because there is a neurological error

29
00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.110
I remember seeing you like this

30
00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:28.280
How could there be a mistake in my design?

31
00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:42.360
I don’t always know how this hairdresser came to be

32
00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:43.850
don't tell me

33
00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:46.870
Is it possible that you are still the designer?

34
00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:52.140
Of course, Taiwan knows your customers

35
00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.890
I have to re-introduce myself to the Resident

36
00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:57.280
I'll take you again

37
00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:58.820
Profession is human

38
00:02:59.070 --> 00:02:59.970
It's you the designer

39
00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:03.170
Ping Shou is also doing his hands on leather
