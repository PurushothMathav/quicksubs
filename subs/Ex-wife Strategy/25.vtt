00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.230
Why, do you still want me to

2
00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:04.070
Do you want to bring a cup here?

3
00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:05.730
Dad, that's not what I meant.

4
00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:09.580
That's settled then. dad!

5
00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.950
It's Shengmian. It must be this Shengmian who is looking for you.

6
00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:15.790
Tell me too.

7
00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:20.970
You said that you are still sick, so he rushed to trouble him.

8
00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.930
You think this Holy Family still has no conscience?

9
00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:28.140
Mom, stop smelling this holy cotton, let me tell you.

10
00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:36.210
Since the old man is still alive, can we still get divorced after getting married?

11
00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:38.540
by me again

12
00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:41.650
Let a lawyer distract you from your contract

13
00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.220
As long as she is her wife and me

14
00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:46.220
Acting in front of the industry

15
00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:51.820
The lawyer is willing to help me survive for myself.

16
00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:57.700
Although people have not been able to help the Ding marriage trap

17
00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:59.300
Okay, I won’t leave

18
00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:09.410
Trap here

19
00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:12.860
What happened to me

20
00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.160
Don't keep saying bitter things, she just wants to help Ge Ge

21
00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:18.300
I'm having sex tonight

22
00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:26.780
Set a direction to talk to you

23
00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:30.340
I don't want to show it to you

24
00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:32.830
Yes, this is it

25
00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:35.310
Is that the one you're talking about?

26
00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:36.630
That's right, it's her

27
00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:39.160
You're so aroused

28
00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:40.160
Follow him and then you

29
00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:41.690
You two dollars are so wrong

30
00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.420
I really appreciate it

31
00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.280
Even if you don’t pay

32
00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:49.720
He, you go for my grandfather

33
00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:53.400
Happy happy happy pick up

34
00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.980
Did I hear it right?

35
00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.910
In normal times, it is more difficult than in winter.

36
00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:59.850
Why did you agree so readily today?

37
00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.330
This room is good

38
00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.580
The moonlight will accompany you

39
00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:06.700
I would like to take a look

40
00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:08.039
How capable are you?

41
00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:09.270
Can there be so many people?

42
00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:10.389
Say it briefly

43
00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:25.030
I also went to the meeting to meet people.

44
00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.040
Just exposed the first few

45
00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.860
I'm going to see him

46
00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:33.400
Come on, come on, come on

47
00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:35.700
Let's do this again

48
00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:36.760
It's not you this morning

49
00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:38.980
There are so few of us who can play, who will be the loser?

50
00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:53.090
It's really nice if we don't just lock them all up.
