00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:10.030
Actually, I'm actually sorry,

2
00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:22.880
I'll make this call first.

3
00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:26.130
Whose business is it? Can you wait for me for a few more days?

4
00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:29.060
I have some plans to get on the small railway, the old man is about to return to China.

5
00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:31.790
My father doesn’t want to aggravate the old man’s condition,

6
00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:34.350
wish you could pretend to be a father with him,

7
00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:37.310
As no less. Father asked me to help Shengjiang,

8
00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:39.160
Get out of trouble.

9
00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.200
It means that he will not share my share anymore.

10
00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.890
That's not the case with money. That's great.

11
00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:52.190
This is not strong enough.

12
00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:54.910
I didn’t expect that my father would kill someone else while he was still free.

13
00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.260
I went down with you to teach me, but here I was distracted by other men.

14
00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.570
Do you really think I'm cheating?

15
00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:03.370
Why don't you help me away?

16
00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:04.569
I did not mean that

17
00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:14.700
Call you out and thank you

18
00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.940
It turns out he really wanted to thank me damn

19
00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:18.820
If I give you death, it will violate the principles of the country.

20
00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:22.700
It’s just the cost. Thank you.

21
00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:24.910
thank you very much

22
00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:26.380
Helped me so much

23
00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:46.800
No need for divorce now

24
00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:47.540
this is great

25
00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:49.020
Tonight is what dad wanted.

26
00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:54.210
Tie up the studio granny again

27
00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:00.980
Are you willing to make me wander and feel full? That’s right, boss.

28
00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:06.290
Have a drink and look much prettier in the photo, Boss Gu Gu Gu

29
00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:07.250
Please let me play

30
00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:14.680
Think about it, think about it, think about it, think about it, think about it, think about it, think about it, think about it, think about it.

31
00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.720
Think about it, think about it, think about it, think about it, think about it, think about it, think about it, think about it, think about it.

32
00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:18.020
