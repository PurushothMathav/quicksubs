00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.170
You? What about you?

2
00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:09.280
Your dad is doing business for the company today.

3
00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:11.220
I haven't had a good night's sleep in several nights.

4
00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:15.830
Do you have to make him angry to death? I can’t afford it.

5
00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:21.330
I, can you understand something?

6
00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:25.560
Now this is the critical moment for the second woman in the company.

7
00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:27.200
You can't divorce him

8
00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:29.550
Even if he begs you

9
00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:33.490
Don’t talk to members. Are you doing well? Shen Nian

10
00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:36.060
What kind of big shot is Fu Yancheng?

11
00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:39.320
You were able to marry him because you were convinced by your mother.

12
00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:41.900
Bio I know what your feet are like

13
00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:45.040
The rest is given to

14
00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.580
Please sign the marriage contract by mistake today

15
00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:50.150
Otherwise we will propose a marriage proposal

16
00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:07.790
Good Sun Sun Sun Lian

17
00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:08.950
I really have some

18
00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:16.060
I want to talk to your Sun family

19
00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.100
Just like this year, a guy who gave you the same answer bought his last name to death.

20
00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.300
This thing is dead, don't worry

21
00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:28.200
I have something to do

22
00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:47.060
Please ask the question Grandpa Mianmian

23
00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:48.980
You are abroad

24
00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:49.800
Raise your troops well

25
00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:52.550
Don't worry about other things

26
00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:54.970
What's the use of worrying about it?

27
00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:56.620
You really taught me a lesson

28
00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:59.110
Already with Cotton Leaf

29
00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:02.630
Also let go of the little grandpa

30
00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:07.470
I'll be back next week

31
00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:08.940
when i'm not around

32
00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.890
No more bullying

33
00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:14.990
See how I clean up

34
00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:17.250
You want to come back next week
