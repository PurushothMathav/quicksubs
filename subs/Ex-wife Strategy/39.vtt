00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:02.810
What do you do next?

2
00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:04.390
He took my place.

3
00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:05.970
I'll always show him what he's looking for.

4
00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:08.720
And he helps me take care of your life and wine.

5
00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:10.910
I always want to thank him for taking care of you.

6
00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.510
Yes, above. This nonsense was not meant for you in the first place.

7
00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.280
No. Got it.

8
00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:21.960
I don't like stealing things in particular.

9
00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.430
I’m tired of riding. What’s wrong with your hands?

10
00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:28.010
That one will cook for you.

11
00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:37.730
Are you hurt as him?

12
00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:40.030
When I meet an internationally famous person, I know one thing.

13
00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.600
If you need it, I can connect it to you.

14
00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:44.780
No need, I'm on your side just in case.

15
00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:45.620
But he was happy.

16
00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:47.920
You're in love. You just returned home, so it's better to rest.

17
00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:00.840
I asked the chicken body to send you back to meet my sister.

18
00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:02.110
Come to see me

19
00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:06.180
How are you feeling better?

20
00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:09.400
You did your best sister

21
00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.200
I've heard everything

22
00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:12.750
It's my mother who is too excited

23
00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:14.950
I love her and you do your best

24
00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:16.400
You don't need to apologize

25
00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.900
Her affairs have nothing to do with you

26
00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:24.660
I know that my sister is the best sister

27
00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.980
I saw the guy with you yesterday

28
00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.830
It's the vice president's

29
00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.120
Are you no longer planning to leave?

30
00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:35.800
Just a taste

31
00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:38.780
I wish I still had social skills

32
00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:39.490
I'm leaving first

33
00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:48.780
Keep it as good as the vice president

34
00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:50.760
How could I still accompany you?

35
00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:06.050
I don’t think it’s natural to live here.
