00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:06.800
Vice President, I would like to discuss the design with you tomorrow.

2
00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:09.870
When will you be in the company?

3
00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.320
Will be there tomorrow

4
00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:17.840
I'll be at the company tomorrow, but I won't go home.

5
00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:42.350
Great. Now I can go see grandpa with peace of mind.

6
00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.390
I'm sorry. My father was sick after his illness yesterday.

7
00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.420
So I stayed close to you

8
00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:49.900
It's just a gift to accompany you. Don't treat it like a joke

9
00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.130
Hey, what are you kidding about?

10
00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:55.950
So beautiful

11
00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:57.170
You are so nice too, so nice

12
00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:58.480
you like to do well

13
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:21.100
You can come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come

14
00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:22.620
Come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come

15
00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:27.860
Come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come

16
00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:36.590
Come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come Come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on

17
00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:38.070
I wish I was divorced

18
00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:43.710
How is it possible to have another child? Grandpa

19
00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:50.980
Then I'll leave first. I'm here to give you a meeting.

20
00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:52.600
It must be why he came back

21
00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.000
Didn't she say she would be at the company today?

22
00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:56.550
why are you here
