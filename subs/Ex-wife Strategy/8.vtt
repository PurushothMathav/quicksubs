00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.050
Why are you going up there? Are you still giving me food to live on?

2
00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:05.320
How does he know that I am interested in convenience and decoration?

3
00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:07.160
Harvest so soon?

4
00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:10.510
That's what I was thinking today

5
00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:14.090
How bad should we be to let the same person serve?

6
00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.000
Don’t you want to have a month?

7
00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.840
No, what month is this?

8
00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:22.330
If you pick one up, let him serve you first

9
00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:23.710
Are you still serving when you're done?

10
00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:25.660
Enough? Contact

11
00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:28.980
Don't make your own decisions in the future. Introduce me to this kind of month

12
00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:32.360
But I think he is really suitable for you

13
00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.250
Then if you think it's not possible

14
00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.110
Then I want it

15
00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.500
I really like it

16
00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:41.250
If you were indifferent now

17
00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.190
Loved these all day

18
00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:44.590
Women can do anything if they don't break up.

19
00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:48.050
Come and work hard tomorrow, everyone

20
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.040
Everyone, what is he trying to say?

21
00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:57.420
It's obviously him

22
00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.530
He said he wanted to renovate the early warning center

23
00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:01.950
And he particularly likes your design style

24
00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:02.990
So we just

25
00:01:04.099 --> 00:01:05.700
But why today?

26
00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:07.630
You are the leader of love

27
00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:09.470
The original copy of the talk about doing business

28
00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:12.890
Maybe my father and I don’t have a hand in each other’s hands.

29
00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:14.870
But you are worried too

30
00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:16.490
I'll accompany you back

31
00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:17.830
I'll talk to her again

32
00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:19.170
I think she is like this today

33
00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.570
It's because she got divorced recently

34
00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:22.330
Not in a good mood

35
00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:26.340
So thank you, Mr. Lin, for the listing. Is there any more?

36
00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:27.760
Where are the drinks today?

37
00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:29.100
Me boys

38
00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.420
It's all wrapped up in us

39
00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:36.760
We'll leave first. Bye.

40
00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:38.410
your blue boy

41
00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:41.540
The job is to be able to take on this day

42
00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:42.560
Is there any

43
00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.420
Just now

44
00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:47.820
It sounds like there is no hope

45
00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:54.770
Don't eat these little blue bosses

46
00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:57.460
Okay, how can there be a way? Hmm

47
00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.190
Then you just said that sometimes

48
00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:04.260
Then that, that, that, that, that, then
