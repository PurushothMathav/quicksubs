1
00:00:04.333 --> 00:00:05.166
Your Majesty

2
00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:06.700
seat grant

3
00:00:14.366 --> 00:00:15.166
Zhu Secret History

4
00:00:15.333 --> 00:00:18.433
If I were to play against the Northern Yuan and the Japanese at the same time

5
00:00:18.766 --> 00:00:20.233
It's almost a win

6
00:00:20.533 --> 00:00:21.333
win rate

7
00:00:22.266 --> 00:00:23.666
Up to three games

8
00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:25.833
Why are you so calm?

9
00:00:26.366 --> 00:00:28.833
I admire nations more than people

10
00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.766
Soldiers are strong by nature

11
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:33.600
Good at trade-offs

12
00:00:34.466 --> 00:00:36.266
Come and go without a trace

13
00:00:37.366 --> 00:00:40.100
And I was bigger than infantry.

14
00:00:40.566 --> 00:00:41.900
Against cavalry

15
00:00:42.266 --> 00:00:45.800
The most important thing is material

16
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.466
Plus 300,000 two-front combat

17
00:00:54.366 --> 00:00:55.633
30% win rate

18
00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:56.966
Already overestimated

19
00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.700
Father, you have fought many battles

20
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:02.466
Can't you defeat the alliance of the Northern Plains and the Snail Kingdom?

21
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:10.600
Your Majesty

22
00:01:11.366 --> 00:01:13.966
This is not the day he was killed on the playground

23
00:01:13.966 --> 00:01:15.300
Is it the default artifact?

24
00:01:17.266 --> 00:01:20.400
Wow, this magic is huge

25
00:01:20.733 --> 00:01:23.066
If you can equip a large number of elite guards

26
00:01:23.666 --> 00:01:25.766
The minister has 5 layers of grasp

27
00:01:25.933 --> 00:01:28.800
Can defeat the allied forces of the Northern Yuan and the Japanese

28
00:01:29.066 --> 00:01:31.100
Explain that history is seeing a grenade

29
00:01:31.533 --> 00:01:34.000
This grenade is so powerful that it can break through boulders

30
00:01:34.666 --> 00:01:38.633
If you send away how much of this grenade equipment

31
00:01:39.466 --> 00:01:41.100
At least 70%

32
00:01:41.166 --> 00:01:43.466
Why is there still a 30% chance of failure?
