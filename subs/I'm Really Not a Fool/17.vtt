1
00:00:00.466 --> 00:00:02.666
Three arrows per person

2
00:00:03.066 --> 00:00:05.800
Who can hit the farthest target?

3
00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:09.866
And the person with the most arrows left on the target

4
00:00:10.766 --> 00:00:12.466
Guida, you come first

5
00:00:20.166 --> 00:00:23.800
Two arrows in three arrows

6
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:26.033
This bow

7
00:00:26.566 --> 00:00:28.266
Why is it so light?

8
00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:36.700
I won.

9
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.633
You you cheat

10
00:00:40.666 --> 00:00:44.000
Cheating in full view of my beloved concubine

11
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.033
How could it be cheating you are

12
00:00:49.266 --> 00:00:50.866
Can't afford to lose?

13
00:00:50.933 --> 00:00:53.666
Saburo Kameda loses, his life is mine

14
00:00:53.666 --> 00:00:56.433
I will kill if I want

15
00:00:56.566 --> 00:00:58.733
Don't be complacent, there are two more sentences

16
00:00:58.733 --> 00:01:00.800
Victory is out of reach

17
00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.933
In the next game, we will compare the speed

18
00:01:03.933 --> 00:01:05.566
Two people move at the same time

19
00:01:05.566 --> 00:01:07.366
Forget the person who is alive

20
00:01:07.366 --> 00:01:08.400
What are the rules?

21
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.200
No rules.

22
00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.766
Living is the rule

23
00:01:10.766 --> 00:01:13.766
Okay, then I will order this game myself

24
00:01:13.766 --> 00:01:15.700
Your Majesty's Body of Gold

25
00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.633
The body is safe

26
00:01:17.666 --> 00:01:20.300
Don't take risks quietly

27
00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.200
Do you teach Guo Zangzhen to do things?

28
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.400
What is this fool doing?

29
00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.300
Yun Wuxiya

30
00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:30.466
If you lose

31
00:01:30.466 --> 00:01:33.133
Your life is mine

32
00:01:33.133 --> 00:01:35.800
You win
