1
00:00:00.566 --> 00:00:02.000
Uh your majesty

2
00:00:02.066 --> 00:00:05.600
I thought I should appease the prince

3
00:00:05.733 --> 00:00:06.666
How to appease

4
00:00:06.966 --> 00:00:08.233
Give them money

5
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:09.866
Give them a meal

6
00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:11.433
Give them beauty

7
00:00:11.866 --> 00:00:15.966
Your Majesty, this matter started with the prince Kou Que

8
00:00:16.333 --> 00:00:18.566
His Majesty must receive the prince

9
00:00:18.566 --> 00:00:20.266
Listen to the prince's appeal

10
00:00:20.266 --> 00:00:22.966
Then I will meet them

11
00:00:23.366 --> 00:00:24.433
But

12
00:00:24.966 --> 00:00:26.533
But what but

13
00:00:26.533 --> 00:00:27.333
I

14
00:00:28.133 --> 00:00:30.600
I really don't know how to deal with poetry

15
00:00:31.066 --> 00:00:32.700
Better than the Prime Minister and Zhang Shangshu

16
00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.766
Stay in the palace these days

17
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.600
Teach me how to deal with poetry

18
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.500
Uh, Chen Zun

19
00:00:39.166 --> 00:00:41.466
Su Hai, pass the order down

20
00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.766
From the sons of Kouque's appeal

21
00:00:43.766 --> 00:00:45.366
Select five representatives

22
00:00:45.766 --> 00:00:47.833
Attack appeal three days later

23
00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:49.433
Yes, Your Majesty

24
00:00:50.366 --> 00:00:52.900
His Majesty left Li Si in the palace

25
00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:54.100
What does it mean to give

26
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:55.700
Leave Li Si in the palace

27
00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:57.300
He can't communicate with the outside world

28
00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.666
I can take action

29
00:00:59.866 --> 00:01:01.866
What does His Majesty intend to do?

30
00:01:02.066 --> 00:01:03.800
Su Hai preaches my will

31
00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.066
Minister of War Li Keran was temporarily appointed as the commander of the march

32
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.000
In addition

33
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.200
You take my Wang Ling and go to the camp outside the city

34
00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:13.033
Ordered the generals from all walks of life to exchange

35
00:01:13.066 --> 00:01:14.300
If there is a return order

36
00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.266
Chop and swap generals

37
00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:17.500
What's the use of this

38
00:01:18.066 --> 00:01:19.566
I know that.

39
00:01:19.733 --> 00:01:21.000
What about in the army?

40
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.633
Every general has his own confidant

41
00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:27.233
With a confidant, you can command the army like an arm

42
00:01:27.733 --> 00:01:30.800
The swapped generals have no way to command the army

43
00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:31.700
original

44
00:01:32.466 --> 00:01:33.866
Ouch, concubine

45
00:01:34.133 --> 00:01:36.966
How did I find out that my beloved concubine is so smart?

46
00:01:36.966 --> 00:01:40.133
Exceptional, my father is a secret messenger

47
00:01:40.133 --> 00:01:42.900
I still know this trick

48
00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.400
Your Majesty has now cut off the celestial wings

49
00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.433
What are you going to do next?
