00:00:06.166 --> 00:00:07.733
He lost.

2
00:00:07.733 --> 00:00:10.033
I didn't lose

3
00:00:10.133 --> 00:00:12.000
A stately body

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.433
It's actually eloquent

5
00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.066
You are Han Chinese, right?

6
00:00:17.066 --> 00:00:18.366
Hahahaha

7
00:00:19.133 --> 00:00:20.800
So?

8
00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.466
Conscience covers the wood

9
00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:24.966
Idle City Master

10
00:00:24.966 --> 00:00:28.866
But I hate traitors the most in my life

11
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.666
Old man, why don't you compare a poem with me?

12
00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:34.466
What is this faint king doing?

13
00:00:34.466 --> 00:00:36.400
How dare you bet on poetry with Shisheng

14
00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:40.433
The old man has heard that the big-eyed emperor is stupid and incompetent

15
00:00:40.466 --> 00:00:41.133
ignorant

16
00:00:41.133 --> 00:00:42.133
No ink

17
00:00:42.133 --> 00:00:43.200
What are you capable of?

18
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.333
Do you dare to compete with this old man?

19
00:00:46.333 --> 00:00:47.500
Why not?

20
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.966
What's wrong with you?

21
00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.066
You just killed someone in front of me

22
00:00:52.066 --> 00:00:53.433
I am very unhappy

23
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:54.966
The painted pottery of this game

24
00:00:55.333 --> 00:00:57.900
Just take the life of your guard and the life of this stomachache

25
00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:00.200
How about changing my life?

26
00:01:01.533 --> 00:01:02.833
Is he crazy?

27
00:01:02.933 --> 00:01:04.400
You're going to fight for your life

28
00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.433
It's a deal.

29
00:01:06.666 --> 00:01:08.233
Good old man

30
00:01:08.266 --> 00:01:10.166
Don't say I bully you.

31
00:01:10.166 --> 00:01:11.433
You ask the question

32
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.966
Lao Tzu is familiar with Tang poetry and Song poetry

33
00:01:14.966 --> 00:01:17.000
I can't torture you dog traitor

34
00:01:17.133 --> 00:01:19.466
Then let's be happy

35
00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.766
What do you think of the time of one stick of incense?

36
00:01:21.766 --> 00:01:24.633
I don't need a stick of incense

37
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
When is the moon?

38
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.200
Ask the sky for wine

39
00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:38.266
I don't know the palace in the sky

40
00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.766
What year is it tonight?

41
00:01:41.066 --> 00:01:42.833
I want to ride home

42
00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:44.866
Fear of Qionglou Yuyu

43
00:01:44.933 --> 00:01:46.466
It's freezing up there.

44
00:01:46.733 --> 00:01:48.200
Dance to figure out the shadow

45
00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.400
How does it seem to be in the world?

46
00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:55.800
Transfer to Zhuge Low Qitu

47
00:01:55.933 --> 00:01:58.666
There should be no hate

48
00:01:59.166 --> 00:02:01.433
When is the circle opposite?

49
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.966
People have joys and sorrows

50
00:02:04.366 --> 00:02:07.466
The moon is cloudy and sunny

51
00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:09.600
This matter is impossible

52
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.966
May it last

53
00:02:13.333 --> 00:02:16.166
A thousand miles together
