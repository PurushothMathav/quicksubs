1
00:00:00.766 --> 00:00:01.633
Your Majesty

2
00:00:01.733 --> 00:00:06.000
I believe that the construction of Shengsendai should be stopped immediately

3
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.300
Mountain Resort

4
00:00:07.333 --> 00:00:10.000
Yaotai and Huofang

5
00:00:10.166 --> 00:00:11.100
That won't work.

6
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:13.633
I promised the two concubines to take them to play

7
00:00:14.466 --> 00:00:16.266
The current national disaster

8
00:00:16.366 --> 00:00:19.166
Your Majesty should not covet personal pleasure

9
00:00:19.366 --> 00:00:20.166
Justice is done

10
00:00:20.166 --> 00:00:21.300
Don't worry

11
00:00:26.466 --> 00:00:27.266
Prime Minister

12
00:00:27.466 --> 00:00:30.366
How much food and grass will this army need to go out?

13
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.766
Uh 300,000 army

14
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.500
At least 500,000

15
00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.066
Food 5 million bags

16
00:00:37.166 --> 00:00:39.366
Enjoy 20 million grains each

17
00:00:39.533 --> 00:00:40.900
It's just so hard

18
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:42.500
Prime Minister

19
00:00:43.133 --> 00:00:44.633
You are inexplicably a small pick

20
00:00:45.566 --> 00:00:46.766
Oops your majesty

21
00:00:47.366 --> 00:00:48.933
I have no such intention

22
00:00:48.933 --> 00:00:52.200
This secret room can testify

23
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.966
Do you really need that much food?

24
00:00:54.966 --> 00:00:55.800
Ladies and gentlemen

25
00:00:56.533 --> 00:00:57.700
Hello?

26
00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.800
Can help me solve the food problem

27
00:01:06.933 --> 00:01:09.100
You are the court officials

28
00:01:09.333 --> 00:01:10.900
Take the court martial arts

29
00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.866
Shi Wei Su Shen all day long

30
00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.400
Can't Kuangfu Design

31
00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.166
I can't keep the people safe

32
00:01:17.166 --> 00:01:18.700
What do I want you to do?

33
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.400
Your Majesty's treasury is empty

34
00:01:21.566 --> 00:01:23.066
Not overnight

35
00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:25.300
But killed over the years

36
00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:26.600
I don't want to hear an explanation

37
00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.200
I only look at the results

38
00:01:29.166 --> 00:01:32.400
I'm more than 200 years old and involved in today's chaos

39
00:01:33.066 --> 00:01:36.100
You are still pushing three and four

40
00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:38.033
It upsets me.

41
00:01:38.866 --> 00:01:40.100
The minister is guilty

42
00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.400
Guilty enough

43
00:01:42.566 --> 00:01:43.800
Waste so much

44
00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.866
Who can help me solve the problem of raw materials?

45
00:01:45.866 --> 00:01:47.966
Beautiful scenery is not a dream

46
00:01:48.866 --> 00:01:50.200
exit

47
00:01:58.566 --> 00:02:00.866
What is Your Majesty's mercy?
