00:00:06.566 --> 00:00:09.133
The wind dissolves the three autumn

2
00:00:09.133 --> 00:00:09.933
leaf

3
00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.100
February flowers

4
00:00:12.866 --> 00:00:14.700
A thousand-foot wave crossing the river

5
00:00:14.866 --> 00:00:17.500
Jizhu Mangan oblique

6
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.300
flower

7
00:00:21.066 --> 00:00:22.300
Spring sleep

8
00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:23.533
I hear birds singing everywhere

9
00:00:23.533 --> 00:00:25.433
The night comes with the sound of rain and flowers falling

10
00:00:31.766 --> 00:00:35.100
Thousands of mountain birds fly and thousands of paths are lost

11
00:00:35.133 --> 00:00:36.700
Lone Boat Kasana

12
00:00:36.966 --> 00:00:39.466
Solo fishing Hanjiang snow

13
00:00:40.366 --> 00:00:42.800
Look at the mountains from a distance

14
00:00:43.666 --> 00:00:45.300
Listen to the water without sky

15
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.400
The street is rainy and crisp

16
00:00:47.966 --> 00:00:52.666
The grass looks close, but the apes on both sides can't cry

17
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.166
The light boat has passed a thousand mountains

18
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.166
Five waiters

19
00:01:00.266 --> 00:01:02.833
I have no mind and no knowledge.

20
00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.000
Absolutely impossible

21
00:01:05.166 --> 00:01:06.433
These 20 poems

22
00:01:06.533 --> 00:01:09.033
Every song can last forever

23
00:01:09.733 --> 00:01:11.400
You must have copied someone else

24
00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.800
Copy someone else's

25
00:01:12.966 --> 00:01:15.000
You have also read the scriptures

26
00:01:15.366 --> 00:01:18.233
Can you tell me that I am a copy?

27
00:01:18.733 --> 00:01:20.733
Even if His Majesty is talented

28
00:01:20.733 --> 00:01:21.866
Ancient and Modern

29
00:01:21.933 --> 00:01:25.433
But it can't hide the fact that you are talented and immoral
