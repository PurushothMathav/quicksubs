00:00:01.066 --> 00:00:03.166
Heavy, how heavy?

2
00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:04.466
Do you have any evidence?

3
00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:06.566
There is no evidence to send someone to check

4
00:00:06.566 --> 00:00:08.100
OK, I'll send you to check

5
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:09.466
Before you arrive

6
00:00:09.566 --> 00:00:11.566
They've already set their consciences on fire

7
00:00:11.566 --> 00:00:13.900
Everyone was killed and ran away

8
00:00:14.933 --> 00:00:16.233
Why are these people so hateful?

9
00:00:16.266 --> 00:00:17.533
In this world

10
00:00:17.533 --> 00:00:19.766
The most hateful thing is the human heart

11
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.700
They'll do anything for money.

12
00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:24.366
Then you can't either.

13
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.233
Eat wheat and rice bran for the victims

14
00:00:27.333 --> 00:00:30.900
Is this the only way to save their lives?

15
00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.133
Your Majesty, what do you say?

16
00:00:34.133 --> 00:00:36.500
This Maeve and Mikan were both born

17
00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:37.666
Profit is not high

18
00:00:37.666 --> 00:00:38.733
What about these corrupt officials?

19
00:00:38.733 --> 00:00:40.566
You don't risk losing your head

20
00:00:40.566 --> 00:00:41.666
Go to the dream

21
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.066
But Maeve is not for people to eat

22
00:00:44.133 --> 00:00:45.800
Can we still be considered human?

23
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:46.833
Pardon me?

24
00:00:47.266 --> 00:00:49.733
I mean in this year of catastrophe

25
00:00:49.733 --> 00:00:52.666
People who are about to starve to death, let alone Mifugan wheat chaff

26
00:00:52.666 --> 00:00:55.633
They can eat bark and grass roots.

27
00:00:55.966 --> 00:01:00.266
Even children are a lump of meat in their eyes

28
00:01:03.266 --> 00:01:05.633
You think I have no humanity, don't you?

29
00:01:05.666 --> 00:01:06.500
Yes

30
00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.366
Ok ok ok you are loyal to me

31
00:01:09.366 --> 00:01:10.466
You think I'm mediocre

32
00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.533
The Qingming Festival is occupied by you

33
00:01:12.533 --> 00:01:15.066
All the bad names in the world are up to me, okay?

34
00:01:16.166 --> 00:01:17.466
You were a fool

35
00:01:17.766 --> 00:01:19.033
Then I tell you

36
00:01:19.166 --> 00:01:21.766
One catty of rice can be exchanged for three catties of rice resistance

37
00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:23.900
Could have saved someone's life

38
00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.033
It can save three people now.

39
00:01:26.133 --> 00:01:28.366
What do you do instead?

40
00:01:30.666 --> 00:01:32.000
Of course, it's just three people.

41
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.300
Didn't you make the same choice?

42
00:01:35.333 --> 00:01:36.466
Governance

43
00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.033
Dashan is ruthless

44
00:01:38.866 --> 00:01:40.200
Country of Little Good

45
00:01:41.666 --> 00:01:42.866
So?

46
00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.033
You are still a good emperor
