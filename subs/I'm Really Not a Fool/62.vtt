00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:01.100
Jinwei

2
00:00:01.766 --> 00:00:03.566
Live in a prosperous place

3
00:00:04.133 --> 00:00:05.833
Soldiers have fun.

4
00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:07.066
neglect of training

5
00:00:07.366 --> 00:00:09.000
combat effectiveness is not strong

6
00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:11.233
Boundless

7
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.300
The corpse soldiers have been in arrears for a long time

8
00:00:14.766 --> 00:00:17.266
Now he has no fighting spirit

9
00:00:17.266 --> 00:00:18.266
There will be no battle

10
00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:19.966
In addition

11
00:00:21.333 --> 00:00:22.866
Life is just saying it doesn't matter

12
00:00:23.166 --> 00:00:26.466
In addition, Cao always has someone who understands foreign countries

13
00:00:27.266 --> 00:00:31.233
The minister is most afraid that they will take action against the grain and support

14
00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:32.766
Retreat the army

15
00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:34.200
I see.

16
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.466
It seems that outside the soil

17
00:00:35.866 --> 00:00:37.566
You must settle down first.

18
00:00:37.766 --> 00:00:41.433
Your Majesty's biggest problem now is the military region

19
00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.066
The army did not move

20
00:00:43.066 --> 00:00:44.466
Grain first

21
00:00:45.466 --> 00:00:48.266
Hundreds of thousands of troops eat, drink and live

22
00:00:48.733 --> 00:00:50.366
It's not a small sum of money.

23
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.100
Just a few million bullets of grain and tens of millions of taels of broken silver

24
00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.100
I caught it with a knife

25
00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.000
Is Your Majesty ready again?

26
00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.166
The homes of those corrupt officials

27
00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.300
Your Majesty, absolutely not

28
00:01:02.733 --> 00:01:03.700
Enemy Current

29
00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.400
Once the tide is unstable

30
00:01:05.733 --> 00:01:07.233
Is there a corpse?

31
00:01:07.733 --> 00:01:09.666
This self-defeating thing

32
00:01:09.666 --> 00:01:11.633
I still won't do it

33
00:01:11.933 --> 00:01:13.366
What is Your Majesty going to do?

34
00:01:13.366 --> 00:01:14.366
My love

35
00:01:14.366 --> 00:01:17.700
Do you know who the richest person in our big fish is?

36
00:01:17.933 --> 00:01:20.700
Naturally, it was Li Si, the great traitor

37
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.766
Aifei, you are wrong.

38
00:01:22.933 --> 00:01:25.333
The richest person is not Li Si

39
00:01:25.333 --> 00:01:28.700
It's a businessperson, a businessperson, right?

40
00:01:28.733 --> 00:01:31.866
They have billions of silver in their hands

41
00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.766
No business is not popular

42
00:01:33.766 --> 00:01:35.266
The country has no business

43
00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.666
Merchant innocent

44
00:01:36.666 --> 00:01:40.566
Your Majesty must not do what the gunmen do to the people

45
00:01:41.333 --> 00:01:42.400
Incompetence and instability

46
00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:43.333
reactive pay

47
00:01:43.333 --> 00:01:44.400
Live without injury

48
00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.400
I still understand these basic principles of governance

49
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.900
Do not steal from merchants

50
00:01:51.066 --> 00:01:53.100
How is His Majesty going to make money?

51
00:01:53.333 --> 00:01:55.766
I am a fool, not a fool

52
00:01:55.766 --> 00:01:58.533
What's the best way to make money with businesspeople?

53
00:01:58.533 --> 00:02:00.166
Do business with them?
