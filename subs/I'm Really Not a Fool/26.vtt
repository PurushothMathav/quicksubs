1
00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:01.800
Champion

2
00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.300
The champion dares to give wheat and rice to the victims

3
00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:06.566
You are still not human

4
00:00:06.766 --> 00:00:08.066
Then don't get excited

5
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:10.500
His Majesty must have his reasons for doing this

6
00:00:10.766 --> 00:00:11.700
reason

7
00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:14.166
He treats the victims as animals

8
00:00:14.166 --> 00:00:15.433
What's his point?

9
00:00:17.333 --> 00:00:19.000
You and your father are brainless

10
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.966
You know how to kill all day long

11
00:00:21.333 --> 00:00:23.166
That's better than you, stupid king

12
00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:24.100
Haojun

13
00:00:24.766 --> 00:00:25.600
I am a fool

14
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.300
Then tell me what to do

15
00:00:28.333 --> 00:00:31.200
Naturally, it is to open a warehouse to release grain, and the victims of the political achievements are affected.

16
00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:34.800
Can the people eat enough by opening the warehouse and putting grain?

17
00:00:35.333 --> 00:00:36.466
Of course!

18
00:00:36.866 --> 00:00:39.833
Opening a warehouse to put grain will only kill more people

19
00:00:39.866 --> 00:00:40.966
How is that possible?

20
00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:42.766
If you open the warehouse to put grain

21
00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.900
Local officials will be successful

22
00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:46.666
Businessperson is greedy

23
00:00:48.266 --> 00:00:50.466
How dare they covet the food of the disaster victims

24
00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.700
As soon as there is a proper profit, people become emboldened

25
00:00:54.733 --> 00:00:56.366
There is a profit

26
00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.000
They are like the secret room faction

27
00:00:58.166 --> 00:00:59.833
There are three times the profit

28
00:00:59.933 --> 00:01:02.466
They can brave the food of brain loss

29
00:01:03.466 --> 00:01:05.733
Then nobody will report them?

30
00:01:05.733 --> 00:01:07.500
Report? Who's going to report?

31
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.033
It's their people from the bottom up

32
00:01:10.066 --> 00:01:13.300
Even if someone wanted to report, they would have already been silenced by them

33
00:01:13.933 --> 00:01:15.300
But even if it is greed

34
00:01:15.566 --> 00:01:17.266
They don't dare to be greedy

35
00:01:17.266 --> 00:01:18.966
No matter how clear it is, you can still eat.

36
00:01:18.966 --> 00:01:20.666
People can eat

37
00:01:20.766 --> 00:01:23.100
They can eat enough for one meal, one bowl of rice soup.

38
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.366
They can't get enough to eat.

39
00:01:24.366 --> 00:01:26.966
They will pay high prices to buy food from officials

40
00:01:26.966 --> 00:01:29.300
So they will take the opportunity to bid up prices

41
00:01:29.333 --> 00:01:30.133
Yes

42
00:01:31.166 --> 00:01:32.966
What should I do if I run out of money?

43
00:01:33.133 --> 00:01:36.100
What should I do if the land is sold out?

44
00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:38.866
The corrupt official forced his mother to sell her children

45
00:01:39.466 --> 00:01:41.100
These people deserve a thousand cuts

46
00:01:41.533 --> 00:01:44.800
Your Majesty, hurry up and send someone to arrest them!
