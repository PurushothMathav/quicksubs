00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:01.900
A few days ago

2
00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:05.500
The princess told me that the late emperor gave the princess a dream

3
00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:06.533
What do you want me to do?

4
00:00:06.533 --> 00:00:10.833
Build an Ascending Immortal Crown on Jinling Zijinshan

5
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.966
The Blade for the Soul of the Ancestor

6
00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:14.166
Beloved wives

7
00:00:14.666 --> 00:00:15.833
What do you think?

8
00:00:16.266 --> 00:00:20.466
Your Majesty's claims of ghosts and gods are illusory

9
00:00:20.733 --> 00:00:21.533
if

10
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.033
Just a word from the concubine is in vain

11
00:00:26.466 --> 00:00:28.300
I'm afraid not

12
00:00:28.566 --> 00:00:31.866
I am greater than the messenger of the world with filial piety

13
00:00:31.933 --> 00:00:33.666
This is to make me unfilial

14
00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.433
Your Majesty has no such intention

15
00:00:37.533 --> 00:00:38.833
What does the prime minister think?

16
00:00:39.266 --> 00:00:43.233
Uh, Your Majesty's filial piety is the qi of all people

17
00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.233
Since the Prime Minister has agreed

18
00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:46.433
Pass the message

19
00:00:47.133 --> 00:00:50.300
Immediately evaporate and sway

20
00:00:50.466 --> 00:00:52.666
On the elf purple mountain

21
00:00:52.666 --> 00:00:56.333
Building the body of Sendai Mountain Resort

22
00:00:56.333 --> 00:00:59.100
All enjoyed by the emperor

23
00:01:01.066 --> 00:01:02.266
Junjun

24
00:01:04.133 --> 00:01:06.266
Obviously you want to enjoy it yourself

25
00:01:06.266 --> 00:01:08.100
But in the name of heaven and earth

26
00:01:08.733 --> 00:01:10.900
Sister Cheng, you dare to talk nonsense again

27
00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.900
Believe it or not, I dragged the concubine out and cut you

28
00:01:14.933 --> 00:01:15.733
you

29
00:01:20.766 --> 00:01:24.366
Your Majesty, there is a flood in Jiangnan now.

30
00:01:24.666 --> 00:01:26.033
At this time, Daxing Yao

31
00:01:26.366 --> 00:01:28.266
I'm afraid it will provoke a popular uprising

32
00:01:28.333 --> 00:01:30.666
I sold them my husband and rice bran to eat

33
00:01:30.666 --> 00:01:32.400
Let them do some work

34
00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.400
Rebellion

35
00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.033
That's outrageous.

36
00:01:35.133 --> 00:01:37.200
Imperial court disaster relief since ancient times

37
00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:38.933
It was natural.

38
00:01:38.933 --> 00:01:41.466
There is nothing natural in this world

39
00:01:41.466 --> 00:01:43.200
Does this rule need to be changed?

40
00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.866
This move may invite criticism

41
00:01:46.333 --> 00:01:47.133
damaged

42
00:01:47.766 --> 00:01:48.900
Your Majesty Yingpin

43
00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:50.266
Let's put it another way.

44
00:01:50.266 --> 00:01:51.500
Treat me with fairness

45
00:01:52.533 --> 00:01:53.866
No work, no food

46
00:01:53.866 --> 00:01:55.000
Starve to death this surface

47
00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.800
What do you think of this idea?

48
00:01:58.866 --> 00:02:00.700
First, it can reflect my filial piety

49
00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.000
Second, it can also provide disaster relief

50
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.300
kill two birds with one stone

51
00:02:03.566 --> 00:02:04.966
Your Majesty is wise

52
00:02:05.133 --> 00:02:05.700
OK

53
00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.200
Then this matter is so happily decided.

54
00:02:08.533 --> 00:02:09.700
Is there anything else?

55
00:02:09.966 --> 00:02:11.433
If it's okay

56
00:02:11.766 --> 00:02:13.600
I'm going back to play with my concubine

57
00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.266
So low tide, low tide.
