00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:00.966
Su Hanshan

2
00:00:01.466 --> 00:00:02.900
You send a few clubs.

3
00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:05.633
Mixed into the Kouque Persimmon and the March respectively

4
00:00:05.866 --> 00:00:07.200
Make a mess

5
00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:08.400
And then...

6
00:00:09.066 --> 00:00:12.100
Kill me a few more peacock persimmons

7
00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:15.066
It's Your Majesty Your Majesty

8
00:00:15.466 --> 00:00:17.600
Persimmons are the foundation of a country

9
00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:20.600
The foundation of a country is the people, not the sons

10
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:23.766
But His Majesty's move may do his best to learn from the heart of the prince

11
00:00:23.766 --> 00:00:25.166
I hope Your Majesty will think again.

12
00:00:25.166 --> 00:00:28.566
Queen, you don't understand people's hearts, right?

13
00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.466
What does Your Majesty mean by this?

14
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.566
This bunch of Kouque princes

15
00:00:32.566 --> 00:00:34.600
And most of them are not petitioning.

16
00:00:34.666 --> 00:00:36.500
It's a pack of follow-up dogs

17
00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.166
Just want to mix circles and ride on one's coattails to broadcast traffic

18
00:00:39.733 --> 00:00:41.733
Give yourself some integrity

19
00:00:41.733 --> 00:00:43.266
Patriotic persona in the palace

20
00:00:43.733 --> 00:00:46.366
Your Majesty, although I don't quite understand

21
00:00:46.366 --> 00:00:47.800
What do you mean?

22
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.766
But why would they do that?

23
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.466
Most of them want to get ahead in the world

24
00:00:52.466 --> 00:00:53.966
Do yourself a good deed

25
00:00:55.366 --> 00:00:57.833
Just a bunch of sophisticated immediatists

26
00:00:58.166 --> 00:01:00.833
What's the business of His Majesty doing this?

27
00:01:08.133 --> 00:01:09.200
Kill Chen Yong

28
00:01:09.933 --> 00:01:12.800
Li Si's wings drive two in three

29
00:01:12.866 --> 00:01:17.100
The next step is to march into the commander Sima shi

30
00:01:17.266 --> 00:01:20.233
So His Majesty is going to take action against Sima Shi

31
00:01:20.333 --> 00:01:21.966
Tell the emissary to go out and enter again

32
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.000
The defense of the city depends entirely on the advance

33
00:01:24.866 --> 00:01:27.366
I'm a little relieved

34
00:01:27.533 --> 00:01:30.433
Your Majesty, you might as well take down Sima Shi directly

35
00:01:30.466 --> 00:01:32.566
Save yourself a lot of trouble.

36
00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.600
I don't engage in any royal crime

37
00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.266
Not to mention the set of Wuji

38
00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:37.366
Guilty is guilty

39
00:01:37.366 --> 00:01:39.666
Innocence is innocence

40
00:01:39.666 --> 00:01:41.066
I am not a fool

41
00:01:41.766 --> 00:01:44.866
Haha, you are not a fool yet
