00:00:00.566 --> 00:00:01.533
Minister of Criminal Affairs

2
00:00:01.533 --> 00:00:04.033
The ladder staff of the Minister of Rites and Imperial History Zuodu

3
00:00:04.333 --> 00:00:05.633
Have you arranged it all?

4
00:00:07.266 --> 00:00:10.266
Is it the princess who wants to know or the forgetful who wants to know?

5
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:12.466
What's the difference?

6
00:00:12.533 --> 00:00:13.466
Of course there is.

7
00:00:14.266 --> 00:00:16.700
If the princess wants King Jin to know

8
00:00:17.533 --> 00:00:18.966
Just kiss me

9
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.066
I will tell you

10
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.300
You dare to fall in love with the late emperor Yu Shuang

11
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.566
Emperor Yu Shuang also thinks about red apricots all day long

12
00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.066
Cheaper, others are not as cheap as me

13
00:00:29.733 --> 00:00:32.033
Dear or not?

14
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.833
Haha, this concubine is still in love

15
00:00:41.133 --> 00:00:44.833
Don't count the money for others after you've been sold.

16
00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:48.733
Your Majesty, Your Majesty is not well

17
00:00:48.733 --> 00:00:50.166
Floods in Jiangnan

18
00:00:50.166 --> 00:00:52.633
The ministers are waiting for His Majesty to make up his mind

19
00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:55.300
You haven't told me the answer yet.

20
00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.966
If the king wants to place his own hands

21
00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.266
There's always a price to pay

22
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:01.900
What do you want?

23
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.433
I have

24
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.566
Your Majesty, there is a flood in Jiangnan

25
00:01:12.566 --> 00:01:14.100
The common people lost their lock

26
00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.200
Apologies are everywhere

27
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.600
Evil scoop

28
00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:20.833
Why doesn't the prime minister provide disaster relief?

29
00:01:20.933 --> 00:01:24.400
Now the treasury is short of food

30
00:01:24.566 --> 00:01:25.933
Besides, you have to deal with the nest

31
00:01:25.933 --> 00:01:27.100
send troops to Liaodong

32
00:01:28.166 --> 00:01:29.566
Incapable of disaster relief

33
00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:30.900
Insufficient stock

34
00:01:30.966 --> 00:01:32.900
Can you give meat to the common people?

35
00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:38.100
No.

36
00:01:39.166 --> 00:01:41.300
What is the expression of making love?

37
00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.233
Am I wrong?

38
00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.000
Why not a meat lover?
