1
00:00:00.766 --> 00:00:03.333
I'm going to build 1,000 dragon boats myself

2
00:00:03.333 --> 00:00:04.700
Take you down to Jiangnan

3
00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.566
Appreciate the beauty of mountains and rivers of big fish

4
00:00:06.566 --> 00:00:08.266
Search for rare treasures

5
00:00:09.333 --> 00:00:12.033
But Your Majesty, it costs a lot to go to Jiangnan

6
00:00:12.066 --> 00:00:14.266
The people will complain

7
00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:15.633
It's miserable.

8
00:00:15.733 --> 00:00:17.166
Of course I know

9
00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.766
It takes a lot of human, physical and financial resources to build a canal

10
00:00:20.766 --> 00:00:23.366
But I had to do it

11
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:24.500
Why is that?

12
00:00:24.566 --> 00:00:28.033
Because building the canal would create a lot of additional industries

13
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.066
This will make the people rich

14
00:00:31.366 --> 00:00:34.700
So in order to make the people rich

15
00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.833
You are willing to be a fool

16
00:00:37.266 --> 00:00:38.700
People Like Me

17
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.866
Accompany my wife and I pillow by his side

18
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:43.866
Endure him and let him

19
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.700
My sins and deeds

20
00:00:47.166 --> 00:00:49.266
Leave it to future generations to judge

21
00:00:53.266 --> 00:00:55.066
Humph

22
00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:56.966
You go too far.

23
00:00:57.766 --> 00:00:59.400
Although Junjun met the cabinet

24
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.566
But the decision is still in the hands of the prime minister

25
00:01:02.566 --> 00:01:04.133
Doesn't change anything.

26
00:01:04.133 --> 00:01:06.200
Why should the prime minister be angry?

27
00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:08.500
Can't you see it?

28
00:01:09.066 --> 00:01:09.733
These days

29
00:01:09.733 --> 00:01:12.366
Several other cities and old men are angry at each other

30
00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.566
They are just dissatisfied with the city walls rejecting their votes

31
00:01:15.566 --> 00:01:16.766
Nothing out of the ordinary.

32
00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:20.700
And that's the insidious part of being in the military

33
00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.833
Let the city and the old man dislike it?

34
00:01:23.966 --> 00:01:25.900
So what do we do?

35
00:01:26.533 --> 00:01:28.566
What has the Red Army been up to these days?

36
00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.233
He hangs out with craftsmen all day and sees dragon boats

37
00:01:32.533 --> 00:01:35.233
It seems that he really wants to go to Jiangnan

38
00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.666
This army is not afraid of the Thousand Miles of Grass Association outside the mansion

39
00:01:39.666 --> 00:01:43.200
First of all, he must be designing to frame the old man

40
00:01:43.533 --> 00:01:45.400
Probably not.

41
00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.400
Faint Monarch has been enlightened these days

42
00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.066
Only make dragon boats by mistake

43
00:01:50.533 --> 00:01:53.466
I heard he hired tens of thousands of people

44
00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:56.433
They built thousands of ships at the same time.

45
00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:59.300
Impossible absolutely impossible

46
00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.066
There must be a conspiracy
