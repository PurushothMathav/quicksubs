Huobu said that Li Feng was during the disaster

3
00:00:06.333 --> 00:00:07.466
greedy dream muff

Li Kang 500,000 sold to Beiyuan Deying 200,000

5
00:00:10.966 --> 00:00:12.466
Mother, this Li Feng?

6
00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.633
If you go into business, you will definitely become very rich

7
00:00:15.533 --> 00:00:17.400
Do you want to arrest Li Feng?

8
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.500
Give Li Feng's evidence to his granddaughter

9
00:00:19.533 --> 00:00:20.633
Yes, Your Majesty

10
00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:22.466
Your Majesty

11
00:00:23.166 --> 00:00:28.000
Chen Tan and Li Feng are greedy for two disasters

12
00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.133
So that the people of Jiangnan are full of evil

13
00:00:31.133 --> 00:00:32.166
Corpses are everywhere

14
00:00:32.166 --> 00:00:34.266
Many disaster victims revolted

15
00:00:34.266 --> 00:00:37.500
Prime Minister, how should this be handled?

16
00:00:37.566 --> 00:00:39.566
Your Majesty, there is no such thing

17
00:00:39.666 --> 00:00:40.800
If it is food

18
00:00:41.333 --> 00:00:42.766
Maybe someone is greedy

19
00:00:43.166 --> 00:00:46.066
But this time it was Maeve who caused the disaster

20
00:00:46.133 --> 00:00:50.600
Mikon asked who they would sell to if they were greedy

21
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.300
What the prime minister said is urgent?

22
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.166
Your Majesty has conclusive evidence

23
00:00:56.166 --> 00:00:59.600

25
00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:05.500
Your Majesty, please see

26
00:01:10.666 --> 00:01:14.233
Hey, this Li Feng is so brave

27
00:01:14.366 --> 00:01:18.766
How dare you steal the disaster grain and sell it to Beiyuan?

28
00:01:18.933 --> 00:01:22.666
Your Majesty's memorial to the King is unfounded

29
00:01:23.133 --> 00:01:24.233
unspeakable

30
00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.433
What the prime minister said is also reasonable

31
00:01:28.933 --> 00:01:31.400
Hey, then say this, you can pass on the decree

32
00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.400
Drive Li Feng into the avenue first

33
00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:34.600
It's your majesty

34
00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.633
Your Majesty, think twice

35
00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:37.700

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.700
Your Majesty, absolutely not
