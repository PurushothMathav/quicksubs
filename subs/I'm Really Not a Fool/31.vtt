00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.566
Clean the glass, clean the glass, play the card

2
00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:07.766
Don't just jump around in there

3
00:00:07.766 --> 00:00:09.666
To clean the glass

4
00:00:11.066 --> 00:00:12.533
Hero black thought

5
00:00:12.533 --> 00:00:14.333
It's all men's bone scrapers.

6
00:00:14.333 --> 00:00:17.433
Yes, yes, the old pervert never deceived me

7
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:19.866
Your Majesty, yes, yes, yes.

8
00:00:19.866 --> 00:00:23.033
We agreed that our brothers have to worship today

9
00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.033
Chen Reese See Your Majesty

10
00:00:28.133 --> 00:00:29.233
Kneel down

11
00:00:29.366 --> 00:00:30.300
Press hands and feet

12
00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.166
Young people come

13
00:00:36.933 --> 00:00:39.900
Prime Minister, you see, this is the demon I invented

14
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.200
Make men want to stop?

15
00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:44.166
Your Majesty

16
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.500
Immerse in the sound of fascination on Sunday and get close to women

17
00:00:47.966 --> 00:00:49.633
Will it delay the court?

18
00:00:49.666 --> 00:00:52.133
Isn't the prime minister's government run by you?

19
00:00:52.133 --> 00:00:53.600
I don't need to ask

20
00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.966
The most important thing for me now

21
00:00:56.866 --> 00:00:58.066
Have a baby

22
00:00:59.333 --> 00:01:00.900
What His Majesty said

23
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:02.500
If His Majesty has this matter

24
00:01:02.533 --> 00:01:03.666
You can become a prince

25
00:01:03.666 --> 00:01:06.200
So the Queen of the country also said the same

26
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.333
Your Majesty, this ceremony is not written

27
00:01:08.333 --> 00:01:11.166
The position of Libu Shushu and Zadu Imperial History

28
00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.433
I have a list

29
00:01:13.666 --> 00:01:17.033
Your Majesty, I have to

30
00:01:24.666 --> 00:01:26.400
Prime Minister, you are late

31
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.300
I have promised the concubine

32
00:01:28.366 --> 00:01:31.800
The princess said that King Jin wants to arrange a few lives.

33
00:01:32.533 --> 00:01:33.966
How can the harem interfere in politics?

34
00:01:34.466 --> 00:01:38.266
How could this princess interfere in the arrangement of the courtiers?

35
00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.066
The princess said that as long as I allow this

36
00:01:42.066 --> 00:01:44.233
The princess let me be blamed

37
00:01:44.666 --> 00:01:45.800
Your Majesty, are you confused?

38
00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.800
This King of Jin is a vassal

39
00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:49.366
Let him stay in the capital

40
00:01:49.366 --> 00:01:51.366
It's already Your Majesty's extrajudicial mercy

41
00:01:51.366 --> 00:01:54.833
He King Jin actually dared to interfere in the affairs of the court

42
00:01:56.466 --> 00:01:58.666
I also invite everyone

43
00:01:58.866 --> 00:02:01.466
Really? What should I do?

44
00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:02.900
I have promised the concubine

45
00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:04.200
If I go back on my word

46
00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.666
I can't talk to the concubine

47
00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:07.466
Oh, you know.

48
00:02:07.466 --> 00:02:11.600
The minister immediately launched the courtiers to talk about where to go

49
00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:13.566
Everything is up to you, Prime Minister

50
00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.300
I retire, Prime Minister, go slowly

51
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.400
Hey, your dance is so boring

52
00:02:22.866 --> 00:02:24.866
Well, I'll teach you one.

53
00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.500
Memories are so beautiful

54
00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.266
Go, Your Majesty
