00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:02.366
Why not?

2
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.366
Do you want to fight or do you want to fight?

3
00:00:09.366 --> 00:00:13.033
Do you want to fight alone or in a gang fight?

4
00:00:13.166 --> 00:00:14.600
Both civil and military are despicable

5
00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:17.300
Wu Fang will send five people to fight

6
00:00:17.466 --> 00:00:19.400
Kofan despises

7
00:00:19.566 --> 00:00:21.000
There should be some talent

8
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.800
If you lose more than you lose

9
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.833
We will cede the Liaodong region to Pinghuo

10
00:00:26.566 --> 00:00:29.233
Homeland is a gamble.

11
00:00:29.733 --> 00:00:31.566
The mixed army is indeed a mixed army

12
00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:33.833
Your Majesty, absolutely not

13
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.300
Why not?

14
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.766
The land of Liaodong is greater than that of the ancestors

15
00:00:38.866 --> 00:00:41.066
Came from a hundred years of battle

16
00:00:41.066 --> 00:00:42.666
How can you give it to others easily?

17
00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:43.900
Hello, people!

18
00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:46.666
Drag him down for me and hit fifty boards again

19
00:00:46.666 --> 00:00:49.100
What crime did your majesty commit?

20
00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:50.100
It's a total debt

21
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.000
As a minister of the Ministry of War, it is a shame that he has not fought the pre-Qin Dynasty

22
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.733
I am strict for the country

23
00:00:55.733 --> 00:00:57.200
Faithful words

24
00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.400
The prime minister is a disloyal person

25
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.266
It's okay for me to punish him like this

26
00:01:01.266 --> 00:01:03.066
Not too much

27
00:01:03.466 --> 00:01:06.366
In the middle of the faint king, there is no distinction between everything and asking for instructions on adultery

28
00:01:06.366 --> 00:01:08.000
It's just dizzy

29
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.166
What if I win?

30
00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:14.433
A fool like you

31
00:01:15.066 --> 00:01:16.166
Still want to rob

32
00:01:16.733 --> 00:01:17.933
I'm just stupid

33
00:01:17.933 --> 00:01:19.166
Not stupid

34
00:01:19.166 --> 00:01:21.300
There is no reason to despise a family that is brilliant

35
00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.233
Prime Minister, what do you think?

36
00:01:23.266 --> 00:01:26.766
Well, what His Majesty said is very good

37
00:01:26.866 --> 00:01:27.866
If you are greater than

38
00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.900
I will be Goryeo

39
00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:31.100
Leave it to you

40
00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.300
Goryeo is not the spirit of Japan

41
00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:35.933
If I want to raise troops to attack

42
00:01:35.933 --> 00:01:37.700
So what talent do you want?
