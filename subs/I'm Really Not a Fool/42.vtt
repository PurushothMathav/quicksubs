1
00:00:00.666 --> 00:00:03.400
Papermaking is in the hands of the Menvar clan

2
00:00:03.666 --> 00:00:05.833
His Majesty wants to promote science and engineering

3
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.566
Isn't it just papermaking?

4
00:00:07.566 --> 00:00:09.166
I have it at my fingertips

5
00:00:09.166 --> 00:00:10.966
Hmph, you really love to brag

6
00:00:11.133 --> 00:00:14.400
Papermaking is a mystery of the Menwar clan

7
00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:16.300
Paper from bark

8
00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:17.566
Bamboo rags

9
00:00:17.566 --> 00:00:19.600
Hemp head as raw material

10
00:00:20.266 --> 00:00:21.866
After rubbing

11
00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.300
Nest pounding and other processes are simple

12
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.000
Even if His Majesty can make paper

13
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.266
And what about books?

14
00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.066
Copy a book for at least two or three months

15
00:00:30.133 --> 00:00:33.600
I have a technology called printing books.

16
00:00:34.133 --> 00:00:36.800
Thousands of books can be printed in a day

17
00:00:37.333 --> 00:00:39.633
How can you print thousands of copies a day?

18
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:48.933
This is the printing press.

19
00:00:48.933 --> 00:00:49.966
similar

20
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.500
What are you and how did you come up with it?

21
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.800
I have already said that I am only nine years tall

22
00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:55.600
Xuefu

23
00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:57.900
If you say you are fat, you will gasp

24
00:00:59.666 --> 00:01:02.466
Su Hai, what about you for a while?

25
00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.033
Follow the process on this paper

26
00:01:05.366 --> 00:01:06.500
Go find a craftsman

27
00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:08.766
Make a batch of paper

28
00:01:09.333 --> 00:01:13.533
His Majesty did not expect him to be so stupid

29
00:01:13.533 --> 00:01:15.000
For 40 million silver

30
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.866
Even the oral lift system will be abolished

31
00:01:17.466 --> 00:01:19.533
Your Highness, this is a good thing

32
00:01:19.533 --> 00:01:22.366
As long as you dare to prepare for the imperial examinations

33
00:01:22.366 --> 00:01:25.166
Those who read all over the world will rise up and attack

34
00:01:25.533 --> 00:01:28.600
At that time, the prince will guard the situation

35
00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.033
But Chen, God help me too

36
00:01:32.166 --> 00:01:33.466
God help me too

37
00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.466
Your Highness, you have won over the cultural world

38
00:01:36.866 --> 00:01:38.500
I tricked you again

39
00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.633
I killed two birds with one stone.

40
00:01:40.966 --> 00:01:42.466
The king is now

41
00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.800
I can't wait.
