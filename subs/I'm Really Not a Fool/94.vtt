00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:01.700
It's this time

2
00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:04.633
What's the use of lying to you?

3
00:00:06.066 --> 00:00:09.300
The King of Jin is also complicit with you

4
00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:11.366
The King of Jin was originally of royal blood

5
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.066
Will he just watch the change of dynasty?

6
00:00:14.333 --> 00:00:17.366
I didn't expect the old man to plan for many years

7
00:00:17.533 --> 00:00:19.633
It's a loss

8
00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.566
Lost at the hands of you bastard

9
00:00:23.766 --> 00:00:25.466
You didn't lose in my hands

10
00:00:25.466 --> 00:00:27.500
You lose at your own hands

11
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.000
Why did I lose to myself?

12
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.900
I have given you so many opportunities

13
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.466
As long as you take a step back

14
00:00:32.733 --> 00:00:35.466
I will ensure your prosperity for the rest of your life

15
00:00:35.466 --> 00:00:37.066
But you don't

16
00:00:37.533 --> 00:00:39.100
People are insignificant

17
00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:40.766
You are seeking death

18
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.700
It's you who forced me step by step

19
00:00:45.133 --> 00:00:46.433
Hey, okay.

20
00:00:46.666 --> 00:00:47.900
It's useless to say that now

21
00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:49.633
Li Se, take it soft now

22
00:00:49.666 --> 00:00:51.666
I'll let you choose to die

23
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:53.800
You die

24
00:00:54.366 --> 00:00:55.466
I die

25
00:00:56.266 --> 00:00:57.200
To make you scold

26
00:00:57.733 --> 00:00:59.866
If the queen hurts half a hair

27
00:00:59.866 --> 00:01:01.266
I will punish you nine clans

28
00:01:02.166 --> 00:01:03.800
What about the ten clans?

29
00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.066
After I Died

30
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.500
Who cares about the flood

31
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.433
You are ready to die

32
00:01:12.466 --> 00:01:14.400
You can't make it easy for you

33
00:01:19.466 --> 00:01:24.066
Under the imperial decree, Li Si rebelled against the three tribes

34
00:01:24.933 --> 00:01:28.733
Zhang Han, the official official, reported meritorious service

35
00:01:28.733 --> 00:01:31.266
Chancellor of the capital

36
00:01:31.933 --> 00:01:34.366
King of Jin accuses

37
00:01:34.366 --> 00:01:35.833
Restore the king

38
00:01:36.066 --> 00:01:38.266
Turn it over immediately
