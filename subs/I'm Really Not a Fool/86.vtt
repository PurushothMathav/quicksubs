1
00:00:04.933 --> 00:00:07.400
Replace the prime minister with a cabinet record

2
00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:10.066
Your Majesty, this move is indeed high

3
00:00:10.566 --> 00:00:14.033
Just why let Li Si's party enter the cabinet

4
00:00:14.466 --> 00:00:16.066
The book emissary is about to go

5
00:00:16.266 --> 00:00:18.100
The court can't make any waves

6
00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:19.700
Stability trumps everything

7
00:00:20.133 --> 00:00:22.100
Even if we want to stabilize the situation

8
00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:24.533
Then His Majesty should also be one or two gullible

9
00:00:24.533 --> 00:00:25.333
Enter the cabinet

10
00:00:25.333 --> 00:00:26.666
To counterbalance adultery

11
00:00:26.766 --> 00:00:28.266
Oops queen

12
00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:31.066
You still don't understand human nature?

13
00:00:31.866 --> 00:00:33.700
Your Majesty, what do you mean?

14
00:00:34.466 --> 00:00:37.300
Now all that member is a comfort person

15
00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.000
Who is willing to submit to others?

16
00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.366
He, Li Si, wants to do one thing, he can do it again and again

17
00:00:43.366 --> 00:00:45.600
But not again and again.

18
00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:47.733
He wants to make a speech

19
00:00:47.733 --> 00:00:51.233
In less than two months, his henchmen will be alienated

20
00:00:51.733 --> 00:00:53.900
Ah, I see, Your Majesty.

21
00:00:53.966 --> 00:00:55.466
This is Yang.

22
00:00:55.733 --> 00:00:57.466
Whether Li Si takes it or not

23
00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:59.300
He will lose 11

24
00:01:00.133 --> 00:01:03.766
This is His Majesty's plan to see its revival

25
00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:07.200
Strictly speaking, see its revival

26
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.433
Restore its hands and feet

27
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:09.900
Is he Lis?

28
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.600
Now I'm thinking about doing whatever I want

29
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:12.766
That's impossible.

30
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.800
Then how is His Majesty going to deal with Li Si next?

31
00:01:16.333 --> 00:01:17.133
Hey

32
00:01:18.966 --> 00:01:20.800
Although Reese is ambitious

33
00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:22.000
whole heart enteritis

34
00:01:22.333 --> 00:01:24.566
But he is indeed a

35
00:01:25.366 --> 00:01:27.100
A rare and capable general

36
00:01:28.266 --> 00:01:29.800
It's a pity that he was born in the wrong era

37
00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:30.900
Met true

38
00:01:31.166 --> 00:01:34.100
So His Majesty is ready to let Li Si go

39
00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.300
I am not an intolerant person

40
00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.400
He, Liswo, is willing to be loyal to the court

41
00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.633
I guarantee his prosperity and wealth for the rest of his life

42
00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:45.466
Wouldn't that be cheap smirk

43
00:01:45.666 --> 00:01:46.466
concubine

44
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.300
I ask you what is loyalty

45
00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.100
Why worry about rape?
