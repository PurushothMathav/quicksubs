00:00:00.933 --> 00:00:01.733
Haojun

2
00:00:01.733 --> 00:00:03.566
How dare you use the copied silver to build the Yao Tai

3
00:00:03.566 --> 00:00:04.733
for your own enjoyment

4
00:00:04.733 --> 00:00:05.600
My love

5
00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.100
Can you not be scared by being cheap at every turn?

6
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:08.566
bluff

7
00:00:08.566 --> 00:00:11.300
If you don't tell me about the ugly conspiracy today

8
00:00:11.333 --> 00:00:12.466
I will never let you go.

9
00:00:12.466 --> 00:00:16.433
Your Majesty, this is to make the people rich

10
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:18.933
Let the fathers of the people come

11
00:00:18.933 --> 00:00:21.366
He collects melons knowing that they are high.

12
00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.000
Even if you collect melons

13
00:00:25.666 --> 00:00:26.933
It's all knowing Minggao

14
00:00:26.933 --> 00:00:28.466
Can you give it back to them?

15
00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.700
That can't be used to build a Yao Tai for you to have a little fun?

16
00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:33.500
Sister misunderstood

17
00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.066
Your Majesty built the Yao Tai in the way of leading the formation

18
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.233
People get paid to work

19
00:00:39.333 --> 00:00:42.266
With money, they can eat and wear clothes

20
00:00:42.333 --> 00:00:45.200
It's called taking from the people and using it for the people

21
00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:46.766
He will be so kind

22
00:00:46.866 --> 00:00:49.266
Then I will take back the success.

23
00:00:49.266 --> 00:00:51.766
Don't make it hard for you to do a good thing

24
00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.266
Is it so unbearable in your eyes?

25
00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.266
Unbearable

26
00:00:56.666 --> 00:00:58.966
So why are you sending small letters?

27
00:00:58.966 --> 00:01:02.000
Your Majesty, we need to invest in infrastructure to drive the economy

28
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.966
What is infrastructure driving the economy?

29
00:01:04.566 --> 00:01:07.600
The court needed manpower and raw materials to build the Yao Tai

30
00:01:07.866 --> 00:01:11.033
When raw material producers have a business, they hire people

31
00:01:11.366 --> 00:01:13.766
People will spend when they earn money

32
00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:17.466
This way, more companies will emerge on the market

33
00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.300
Our court collects commercial taxes

34
00:01:19.333 --> 00:01:20.666
Invest in Yaotai again

35
00:01:20.666 --> 00:01:23.866
It's a virtuous circle in the economy.

36
00:01:24.066 --> 00:01:25.300
I see

37
00:01:25.466 --> 00:01:29.033
I didn't expect this Air Force to know a lot

38
00:01:30.333 --> 00:01:33.000
I just moved slightly

39
00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:34.500
In fact, I know better

40
00:01:35.133 --> 00:01:37.533
Su Girl Jin Gen Dongxuanzi

41
00:01:37.533 --> 00:01:40.633
What is Su Girl Jin Gen Dongxuanzi?

42
00:01:41.333 --> 00:01:42.800
You come to the mountain room at night

43
00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.700
I call you alone
