00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:03.133
Oh, I happen to be missing a spray control girl.

2
00:00:03.133 --> 00:00:06.000
The queen of Japan is just right for this position

3
00:00:06.066 --> 00:00:07.933
How dare you

4
00:00:07.933 --> 00:00:10.000
Dare to insult our queen

5
00:00:10.133 --> 00:00:13.500
You are humiliating yourself by challenging the big fish

6
00:00:13.566 --> 00:00:15.466
I'm just fulfilling you

7
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.466
What a self-inspiring and beautiful drama

8
00:00:18.466 --> 00:00:19.700
Don't push

9
00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:21.433
Just say dare

10
00:00:21.466 --> 00:00:22.766
Why not?

11
00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.700
Okay, I'll see you in contempt after three days

12
00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:27.166
It's a deal.

13
00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:31.900
Prime Minister, you immediately organize courtiers to fight

14
00:00:31.933 --> 00:00:34.133
Well, Your Majesty, what does this mean?

15
00:00:34.133 --> 00:00:35.900
I accept the Japanese war letter

16
00:00:35.966 --> 00:00:38.500
It's impossible to play and despise it yourself

17
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.366
Prime Minister, you are the ruler of my Forbidden City

18
00:00:46.366 --> 00:00:47.566
Rule the world

19
00:00:47.566 --> 00:00:49.866
This little thing should not be difficult for the prime minister

20
00:00:49.866 --> 00:00:53.466
Uh, is the Red Army really stupid or fake stupid?

21
00:00:53.733 --> 00:00:57.100
He's going to throw the blame for the book on Li Si

22
00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.366
obey the decree

23
00:00:59.933 --> 00:01:03.033
Okay, so happily decided, captain

24
00:01:13.266 --> 00:01:15.066
Is the emperor tricking you?

25
00:01:15.066 --> 00:01:16.133
If you lose

26
00:01:16.133 --> 00:01:18.400
I'll let you carry the responsibility of my brother

27
00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:19.900
Brother, if you win

28
00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:21.800
This is the emperor's mad sword

29
00:01:21.933 --> 00:01:24.033
How could he be a fool?

30
00:01:24.533 --> 00:01:25.600
Have this wisdom

31
00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:26.866
Xiaguan thinks

32
00:01:26.933 --> 00:01:30.866
The impression of the lost king is usually just greedy for good looks

33
00:01:30.966 --> 00:01:31.833
OK

34
00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.833
Su Hai, go find a few craftsmen

35
00:01:34.866 --> 00:01:37.133
Make something on this drawing for me, hum

36
00:01:37.133 --> 00:01:38.233
Yes, Your Majesty
