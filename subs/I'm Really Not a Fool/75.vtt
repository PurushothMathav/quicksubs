00:00:00.666 --> 00:00:01.966
folk rumor

2
00:00:02.333 --> 00:00:04.666
Your Majesty has no ink on his chest

3
00:00:04.666 --> 00:00:05.766
ignorant

4
00:00:05.766 --> 00:00:06.866
Not stupid

5
00:00:07.266 --> 00:00:10.366
Does it have to be true?

6
00:00:10.366 --> 00:00:12.100
I read widely since I was a child

7
00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:13.066
Xuefu Five Cars

8
00:00:13.066 --> 00:00:14.466
ancient and modern

9
00:00:14.966 --> 00:00:16.500
Who wouldn't brag

10
00:00:16.666 --> 00:00:17.566
brag

11
00:00:17.866 --> 00:00:21.166
Have you ever heard a song that cheers you up?

12
00:00:21.166 --> 00:00:23.233
When is the bright moon?

13
00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.666
That's the poem of Su Dongpo, the god of poetry you copied

14
00:00:27.133 --> 00:00:27.933
Is that so?

15
00:00:27.933 --> 00:00:31.766
I will give each of you four chances

16
00:00:31.766 --> 00:00:33.333
If you ask a question, I will answer it.

17
00:00:33.333 --> 00:00:35.000
If I can't answer

18
00:00:35.133 --> 00:00:37.266
I confess that I am a fool

19
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.866
Sister, Your Majesty is so crazy

20
00:00:40.133 --> 00:00:42.566
Crazy also has crazy capital

21
00:00:42.933 --> 00:00:44.500
What His Majesty said is true

22
00:00:44.766 --> 00:00:46.633
I am the Son of Heaven

23
00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:48.400
One word

24
00:00:49.266 --> 00:00:52.100
Hmph, I am familiar with Tang's Song poetry

25
00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.233
This can still stumble me

26
00:00:54.666 --> 00:00:56.833
My wife pours wine for me

27
00:01:01.966 --> 00:01:03.033
only come

28
00:01:05.566 --> 00:01:06.766
Molai

29
00:01:08.533 --> 00:01:09.566
recently

30
00:01:11.966 --> 00:01:14.566
The queen cares for me
