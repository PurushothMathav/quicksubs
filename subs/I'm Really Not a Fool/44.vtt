00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:00.933
Haojun

2
00:00:00.933 --> 00:00:03.466
You are going to be as hard as steel with the doorsman to the end

3
00:00:03.466 --> 00:00:04.700
You are not afraid of tomorrow

4
00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:06.633
This full dynasty did not come to the dynasty

5
00:00:06.733 --> 00:00:08.300
Haha, okay.

6
00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:10.300
It's good that they don't come to court

7
00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:12.966
I'm trying to hire a group of new people

8
00:00:13.133 --> 00:00:15.533
These three-legged toads are hard to find

9
00:00:15.533 --> 00:00:18.766
Two-legged people are all over the street

10
00:00:19.166 --> 00:00:20.366
This court challenges

11
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.633
Not a bunch of newcomers talking about control

12
00:00:22.933 --> 00:00:24.200
Coincidentally not

13
00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:26.533
My queen

14
00:00:26.533 --> 00:00:29.066
A pragmatic handbook for the court has recently been written

15
00:00:29.066 --> 00:00:30.766
Follow this book

16
00:00:30.766 --> 00:00:32.700
Even newcomers

17
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.166
You can't go wrong.

18
00:00:34.166 --> 00:00:35.966
Oh, the queen has to be you.

19
00:00:35.966 --> 00:00:38.166
Virtuous and virtuous wrote such a good book

20
00:00:38.166 --> 00:00:39.066
Oh my concubine

21
00:00:39.066 --> 00:00:40.733
If there were only two of you in this world

22
00:00:40.733 --> 00:00:43.000
I really feel so warm

23
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.866
Why is this paper so memorable?

24
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:46.833
This one.

25
00:00:46.933 --> 00:00:49.366
It's the book I made, and I have to wipe my butt with paper

26
00:00:49.366 --> 00:00:50.833
Enjoy later.

27
00:00:51.333 --> 00:00:53.400
Why are these words the same?

28
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.766
This is my newly invented printing technique

29
00:00:55.766 --> 00:00:57.700
10,000 copies can be printed a day

30
00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.000
His Majesty holds a weapon

31
00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.366
Cao Mingde is willing to worship

32
00:01:02.366 --> 00:01:03.866
There you go.

33
00:01:03.866 --> 00:01:05.900
Those who seek good luck and avoid evil are gentlemen

34
00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.600
It's not over for the two of you to get lost

35
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.166
I hope Your Majesty will give the door a way to live

36
00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:13.266
Where am I?

37
00:01:13.266 --> 00:01:14.200
There's also steelmaking.

38
00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.900
Concrete two doors technology can be passed on to you

39
00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:19.100
Make two million dollars a year

40
00:01:19.733 --> 00:01:24.000
I want the Menfah family to withdraw from the court forever

41
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.600
Thank you your majesty
