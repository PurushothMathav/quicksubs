1
00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.433
Why did you hit someone?

2
00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:03.400
I hit you lightly

3
00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:05.400
You slander the princess's innocence

4
00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:06.800
Pass on the decree

5
00:00:06.866 --> 00:00:09.433
If someone slander the princess's innocence again

6
00:00:09.466 --> 00:00:11.166
Zhang Wu is young

7
00:00:11.166 --> 00:00:12.866
Difficult to report

8
00:00:12.866 --> 00:00:14.033
Reward Bailiang

9
00:00:17.166 --> 00:00:19.833
King Jing is the brother of the late emperor

10
00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:21.566
His Majesty imprisoned him

11
00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:24.100
Isn't it what Junjun did?

12
00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:25.866
Su Haihou

13
00:00:25.966 --> 00:00:28.400
You come and explain to this prince

14
00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:31.733
King Jing colluded with the Northern Yuan and Laos

15
00:00:31.733 --> 00:00:34.233
Intent to subvert is greater than the country

16
00:00:34.533 --> 00:00:37.000
Impossible King Jing is a wise king

17
00:00:37.366 --> 00:00:39.300
King Jing wants to rebel

18
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.500
The evidence is solid

19
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:41.833
There's no question about it.

20
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.466
Even if King Jing deserved it

21
00:00:44.466 --> 00:00:47.433
It's always true to reuse eunuchs, right?

22
00:00:47.666 --> 00:00:50.000
When have I reused eunuchs?

23
00:00:50.266 --> 00:00:53.466
Don't you reuse eunuchs by making them princes?

24
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.366
Suhaigong Zhongti Kingdom

25
00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.033
Raised more than 30 million taels for the army

26
00:01:00.266 --> 00:01:01.833
He served the court well

27
00:01:01.866 --> 00:01:04.300
Shouldn't I reward him?

28
00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.666
Those businesspeople were forced by traitors

29
00:01:07.766 --> 00:01:08.800
Have you investigated

30
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.800
If not forced by power

31
00:01:10.866 --> 00:01:12.966
Who would give money to a eunuch?

32
00:01:13.366 --> 00:01:14.366
I ask you

33
00:01:14.666 --> 00:01:17.800
Am I the most powerful person in the world?

34
00:01:17.966 --> 00:01:19.200
Of course.

35
00:01:19.266 --> 00:01:20.366
Then I tell you

36
00:01:20.366 --> 00:01:21.666
I want to take a picture of Hao

37
00:01:21.666 --> 00:01:23.366
Beijing agency of Tianming Light Mirror

38
00:01:23.366 --> 00:01:24.900
It took 150,000 two

39
00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.233
Your collusion instrument does not count

40
00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.000
Then I'll tell you again

41
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.366
All the officials here

42
00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.100
They are all vying for the right to shoot

43
00:01:34.166 --> 00:01:36.433
No way. Why would they do that?
