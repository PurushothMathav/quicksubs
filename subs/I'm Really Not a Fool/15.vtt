00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:03.800
Faint King can actually export it into a chapter

2
00:00:04.166 --> 00:00:05.800
Simply a wizard

3
00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:07.200
This time Gussiqi

4
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.266
Very romantic

5
00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:10.900
It can definitely be passed down through the ages

6
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:13.466
What a poem!

7
00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:15.833
So-so.

8
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.200
The old man is here for you.

9
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.600
Come on show

10
00:00:20.733 --> 00:00:22.933
Impossible. You wrote it for me

11
00:00:22.933 --> 00:00:25.500
How can you make such a delicious meal?

12
00:00:25.933 --> 00:00:28.066
It must be copied correctly

13
00:00:28.066 --> 00:00:29.133
This is copied.

14
00:00:29.133 --> 00:00:30.866
Copy the poems of Wenhua Su Dongpo

15
00:00:30.866 --> 00:00:32.366
If you have the ability, you can try it too

16
00:00:32.533 --> 00:00:33.900
Shi Sheng Su Dongpo

17
00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:35.200
Never seen

18
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.500
That's because you are shallow.

19
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.433
What about your poetry?

20
00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:43.100
I can't write it, you lose

21
00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.500
I admit defeat

22
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.300
I've heard it before

23
00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.133
This young man is prosperous

24
00:00:49.133 --> 00:00:50.800
Elderly bone marrow emptiness

25
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.666
I've been looking for a chance to try it out

26
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.500
I'll cut you today

27
00:00:55.533 --> 00:00:58.066
Somebody take it off for me

28
00:00:58.366 --> 00:01:00.466
You you faint lord

29
00:01:00.533 --> 00:01:02.100
Faint tyrant

30
00:01:02.533 --> 00:01:04.166
You actually use living people as a career

31
00:01:04.166 --> 00:01:05.900
You are worse than a dog

32
00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:07.800
Heaven won't let you go

33
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.100
From the moment you colluded with the Japanese

34
00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.400
You've already ignored people

35
00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:14.733
Drag me down

36
00:01:14.733 --> 00:01:16.566
drum pulp

37
00:01:17.333 --> 00:01:19.033
Twilight Tyrant

38
00:01:19.266 --> 00:01:22.633
Hahahahaha!
