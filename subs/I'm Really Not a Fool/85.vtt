1
00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:01.800
The Prime Minister is the capital

2
00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:03.533
Naturally, the prime minister is the main one

3
00:00:03.533 --> 00:00:06.233
Other cabinet members are responsible for assisting me

4
00:00:06.266 --> 00:00:09.766
Mainly I hope to help you solve your problems.

5
00:00:09.966 --> 00:00:13.100
Well, then this gap is suitable again

6
00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:17.333
The functions of the cabinet are divided into two. One is to vote for you to play the chapter

7
00:00:17.333 --> 00:00:20.166
Give a preliminary opinion, the second is to wear red

8
00:00:20.333 --> 00:00:22.100
Make the final decision

9
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:23.833
Who votes for you?

10
00:00:23.866 --> 00:00:24.866
Who is wearing red

11
00:00:24.866 --> 00:00:26.766
Naturally, it is covered in red by the prime minister

12
00:00:26.766 --> 00:00:28.500
The cabinet member is responsible for voting for you

13
00:00:28.866 --> 00:00:31.233
I dare to ask Your Majesty

14
00:00:31.866 --> 00:00:33.366
If Chen and other opinions are blocked

15
00:00:33.666 --> 00:00:35.200
How about opening the crotch again?

16
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.300
The cabinet consists of 5 people

17
00:00:37.366 --> 00:00:39.300
If you disagree with the prime minister

18
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.266
Show of hands

19
00:00:40.266 --> 00:00:42.266
Based on the majority opinion

20
00:00:42.266 --> 00:00:44.100
If the Prime Minister still feels inappropriate

21
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.666
Can hand over the final decision-making power to the field

22
00:00:46.666 --> 00:00:49.500
I will make the final decision

23
00:00:50.266 --> 00:00:53.266
Hey, what a good prime minister

24
00:00:53.266 --> 00:00:56.166
You must lead that person to handle state affairs well

25
00:00:56.166 --> 00:00:57.400
Help me solve problems

26
00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:58.866
I can sleep high

27
00:00:58.866 --> 00:01:01.200
Worry-free, take a few concubines to Jiangnan

28
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:04.300
Go and enjoy the Damei River and Mountain where the big fish are

29
00:01:05.966 --> 00:01:07.700
Relief for His Majesty

30
00:01:07.766 --> 00:01:09.700
The duty of the minister

31
00:01:10.733 --> 00:01:14.100
Prime Minister, you said that you will see the cabinet

32
00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.300
What's the point?

33
00:01:18.166 --> 00:01:21.100
Junjun wants to abolish the prime minister system

34
00:01:21.266 --> 00:01:23.100
Take the power of the old man

35
00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:28.100
But the members of the cabinet all show their hairpins with the head of the prime minister Ma

36
00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:31.533
What's the difference between this and the prime minister calling the shots?

37
00:01:31.533 --> 00:01:33.166
That being said

38
00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.900
But everyone has selfishness

39
00:01:35.966 --> 00:01:39.166
There are always people who don't want to be controlled by the old man.

40
00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:41.400
Prime Minister

41
00:01:41.766 --> 00:01:46.000
The lower official has always been loyal to the prime minister's order

42
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.700
From absolutely no two hearts

43
00:01:48.733 --> 00:01:51.700
Hahaha so good

44
00:01:52.266 --> 00:01:54.400
Prime Minister, you said

45
00:01:54.666 --> 00:01:56.433
Haojun will really go to Jiangnan

46
00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.366
If you really go to Jiangnan

47
00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:04.000
The old man let him go
