00:00:00.666 --> 00:00:02.466
Your Majesty, what do you mean?

2
00:00:02.466 --> 00:00:05.166
I not only ask you to defeat the Northern Yuan and the Japanese

3
00:00:05.166 --> 00:00:07.666
I want you to take the 300,000 army of Japan

4
00:00:07.666 --> 00:00:09.366
All stay in Liaodong

5
00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:11.500
Why leave the snail?

6
00:00:12.066 --> 00:00:14.400
The cochlear country has sent me Huaxia for a long time

7
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.800
Has been trying to invade and occupy our country

8
00:00:18.133 --> 00:00:19.566
Lang Zi Ambition

9
00:00:19.966 --> 00:00:21.066
demonstrably affectionate

10
00:00:21.733 --> 00:00:25.066
This time I will teach them a bloody lesson

11
00:00:25.366 --> 00:00:28.400
Let them know the offender

12
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.133
Although far away

13
00:00:30.133 --> 00:00:30.966
minister

14
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.400
Dingyang left 300,000

15
00:00:34.733 --> 00:00:36.033
Stay in Liaodong

16
00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.200
300,000 snail soldiers leave no blessing

17
00:00:39.466 --> 00:00:41.666
After killing all the grant officers

18
00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:43.433
Implement the order

19
00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:44.466
I want to let Woo

20
00:00:44.466 --> 00:00:46.700
People will remember it forever

21
00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:48.600
The price of committing my Huaxia

22
00:00:49.666 --> 00:00:51.466
obey the decree

23
00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:53.700
The prime minister is old

24
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.466
I work all day long on state affairs

25
00:00:55.466 --> 00:00:58.600
I really can't bear it.

26
00:00:58.600 --> 00:00:59.700
Hey

27
00:01:00.466 --> 00:01:03.866
Therefore, I have decided to establish a cabinet

28
00:01:04.466 --> 00:01:05.900
Department of Criminal Justice

29
00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:09.166
The four official books of the ritual department and the force department are entered into the grid

30
00:01:09.166 --> 00:01:11.800
Assist the Prime Minister in handling state affairs

31
00:01:12.566 --> 00:01:15.033
Your Majesty thinks

32
00:01:15.366 --> 00:01:17.500
It doesn't seem right.

33
00:01:18.766 --> 00:01:19.566
Prime Minister

34
00:01:20.366 --> 00:01:23.233
Why doesn't it feel right?

35
00:01:23.533 --> 00:01:26.166
As the saying goes, there are thousands of Taoists

36
00:01:26.166 --> 00:01:27.333
The Lord is one

37
00:01:27.333 --> 00:01:29.633
This cabinet has added so many members

38
00:01:29.733 --> 00:01:32.066
Who is in charge of this government?
