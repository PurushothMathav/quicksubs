00:00:00.766 --> 00:00:02.200
Loyalty to His Majesty is loyalty

2
00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:03.800
If you go against it, you will be raped.

3
00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:05.866
Then if you are really a fool

4
00:00:05.933 --> 00:00:09.133
Isn't it true that loyalty to justice will harm the people?

5
00:00:09.133 --> 00:00:11.666
Is Yue Ming also loyal?

6
00:00:12.066 --> 00:00:13.233
That certainly doesn't count

7
00:00:13.466 --> 00:00:14.100
Right.

8
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:16.766
So there is never a fixed standard in the middle

9
00:00:16.766 --> 00:00:18.000
different positions

10
00:00:18.066 --> 00:00:19.866
Even the dead are different in the middle

11
00:00:20.333 --> 00:00:21.833
Fake Honey

12
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:23.500
cloak it with frost

13
00:00:23.666 --> 00:00:25.333
The human heart is the most fickle

14
00:00:25.333 --> 00:00:27.066
What about today's traitor?

15
00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.466
Not the human performers of virtual idols

16
00:00:29.466 --> 00:00:31.500
And what about today's human performers of virtual idols?

17
00:00:32.133 --> 00:00:35.566
It doesn't have to be tomorrow's great traitor

18
00:00:35.566 --> 00:00:36.366
OK

19
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.033
People's ambitions grow step by step

20
00:00:40.566 --> 00:00:43.733
Yeah, so there are no friends forever.

21
00:00:43.733 --> 00:00:45.100
There are no permanent enemies

22
00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:46.800
Only the eternal beloved concubine?

23
00:00:46.866 --> 00:00:49.966
Then His Majesty hands over the government to the cabinet

24
00:00:50.266 --> 00:00:53.366
Are you going to let go? Now the court is stable

25
00:00:53.366 --> 00:00:55.166
In fact, it doesn't matter whether there is a certificate or not.

26
00:00:55.166 --> 00:00:57.066
Everyone earns the same without the earth

27
00:00:57.733 --> 00:00:59.066
Your Majesty is disrespectful to heavy objects

28
00:00:59.066 --> 00:01:00.366
What are you going to do next?

29
00:01:00.566 --> 00:01:03.033
I'm ready to continue being a fool

30
00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.100
Your Majesty has clearly just washed away the name of the fainted king

31
00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:07.366
Why repeat the same mistakes

32
00:01:07.366 --> 00:01:08.300
I can't help it.

33
00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:09.966
Who let me have two people by my side?

34
00:01:09.966 --> 00:01:11.800
Such a beautiful woman

35
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.200
Your Majesty is pretending again

36
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.166
Tell me what are you doing?

37
00:01:19.533 --> 00:01:21.266
I want to be a finalist

38
00:01:21.366 --> 00:01:23.166
A good emperor is not appropriate

39
00:01:23.166 --> 00:01:25.666
Why did His Majesty become a craftsman?
