00:00:02.066 --> 00:00:04.266
You have to get some prizes anyway

3
00:00:04.266 --> 00:00:05.000
What do you want?

Don't wait to run away with the girl like smoke

12
00:00:22.266 --> 00:00:23.500
Now listen to this.

13
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.100
My first link is lonely and cold, and the window is empty and widowed.

00:00:47.566 --> 00:00:49.300
You must have cheated.

23
00:00:49.666 --> 00:00:52.500
The topic is yours, how can I cheat?

24
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.200
Willing to admit defeat 100,000 two silver

25
00:00:55.466 --> 00:00:57.866
If you want to take my money, you at least have to spend it with your life

26
00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:59.700
How ridiculous

27
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:01.633

Why do plum blossom tears exist?

33
00:01:16.666 --> 00:01:17.766
Who are you really?

00:01:17.766 --> 00:01:19.300
I'm someone you can't afford to offend

35
00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:20.866
If you dare to touch a hair on me

36
00:01:20.866 --> 00:01:22.200
My father won't let you go
