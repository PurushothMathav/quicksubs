1
00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.933
Minister of Criminal Affairs Cai Yong

2
00:00:01.933 --> 00:00:03.966
He is the champion of the late emperor Qindian

3
00:00:03.966 --> 00:00:05.400
literary talent

4
00:00:05.666 --> 00:00:07.266
Prime Minister, what do you think?

5
00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:11.600
Can Zuo Du Jade Li Chunshan

6
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:13.600
He is the prime minister's right-hand man

7
00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:14.966
I guess it's a talent

8
00:00:14.966 --> 00:00:17.900
Your Majesty, I have little talent and learning

9
00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:18.900
Hard to do

10
00:00:18.933 --> 00:00:20.566
shallow learning

11
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.800
Then how did you become the governor and governor?

12
00:00:24.166 --> 00:00:27.166
It's not the official who bought it, is it?

13
00:00:29.266 --> 00:00:31.033
I am more willing to fight than to fight

14
00:00:31.066 --> 00:00:32.433
Is that right?

15
00:00:32.533 --> 00:00:35.133
There are two people who are better than me

16
00:00:35.133 --> 00:00:36.833
The minister of learning and wealth

17
00:00:36.933 --> 00:00:38.166
I'm afraid you won't make it

18
00:00:38.333 --> 00:00:40.533
I will do my best

19
00:00:40.533 --> 00:00:42.600
Live up to the trust

20
00:00:42.866 --> 00:00:44.700
Five games in total

21
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.200
There are only two of you.

22
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.700
Two people are enough for you

23
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.700
However, to be fair

24
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.566
I and my two beloved concubines

25
00:00:53.133 --> 00:00:54.500
Decided to join

26
00:00:57.066 --> 00:00:59.133
This dim lord is so playful

27
00:00:59.133 --> 00:01:00.900
Treat the contempt of the two countries as a game

28
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:02.133
Be serious

29
00:01:02.133 --> 00:01:03.933
Seriously, I am the Son of Heaven

30
00:01:03.933 --> 00:01:05.466
Words speak the essence

31
00:01:05.566 --> 00:01:07.066
Greater than the emperor

32
00:01:07.333 --> 00:01:09.466
Do you dare to add horses?

33
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.600
Sure. What are the stakes?

34
00:01:11.733 --> 00:01:15.766
Gambling with life, the losing side allows the winning side to take a hundred steps

35
00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:18.533
Hey, is this fun?

36
00:01:18.533 --> 00:01:20.700
I really like it. Let's get started

37
00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.300
I can't wait anymore.

38
00:01:22.333 --> 00:01:24.533
What's wrong with your teacher in the first game?

39
00:01:24.533 --> 00:01:29.100
We sent Master David with a stomachache.

40
00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:34.466
So much love

41
00:01:34.466 --> 00:01:35.733
You have the talent of the champion

42
00:01:35.733 --> 00:01:36.866
Want to write a monument

43
00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.166
This first round is up to you to travel

44
00:01:39.266 --> 00:01:42.266
Your Majesty's subjects

45
00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.300
Why are you the champion?

46
00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.433
I will also be afraid of the stomach pain of that unknown reputation

47
00:01:49.333 --> 00:01:52.666
His Majesty's stomachache is David's poet

48
00:01:52.733 --> 00:01:54.366
Poetry crowns Kyushu

49
00:01:54.366 --> 00:01:56.966
I don't think I'm a match for the poet

50
00:01:58.166 --> 00:01:59.966
Since you admit defeat

51
00:02:00.066 --> 00:02:01.500
Then buy it with your life

52
00:02:01.533 --> 00:02:04.000
Stop it. It's bigger than the border.

53
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.700
Que Ruoer and others kill innocent people indiscriminately

54
00:02:06.466 --> 00:02:07.700
willing to admit defeat

55
00:02:11.133 --> 00:02:12.033
heavy rain

56
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.300
you

57
00:02:14.866 --> 00:02:16.500
lost
