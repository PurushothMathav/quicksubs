00:00:00.533 --> 00:00:01.800
Talent without virtue

2
00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:05.366
Where did this start?

3
00:00:05.366 --> 00:00:07.066
Your Majesty favors the harem

4
00:00:08.966 --> 00:00:10.566
Chromaticity is also

5
00:00:10.666 --> 00:00:11.866
I favor the harem

6
00:00:11.866 --> 00:00:13.100
What kind of crime?

7
00:00:13.266 --> 00:00:15.200
Could it be that I will die alone?

8
00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.200
Let the big fish die?

9
00:00:17.566 --> 00:00:19.300
Then you can't let the harem do me

10
00:00:19.933 --> 00:00:22.700
I have always been the prime minister in charge of the imperial court

11
00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:23.933
I rarely ask

12
00:00:23.933 --> 00:00:25.800
How to say harem liver disease

13
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.766
Even if the harem doesn't have liver disease

14
00:00:27.766 --> 00:00:29.600
His Majesty invented the artillery network

15
00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:33.566
Torture such as zero magnetism in the vegetable basin is also the work of Yunjun

16
00:00:33.666 --> 00:00:35.366
Have you ever seen this big fish?

17
00:00:35.366 --> 00:00:37.166
Has anyone used these tortures?

18
00:00:37.166 --> 00:00:40.200
If you tell me, I will punish him.

19
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.200
Li Feng, the former Minister of the Ministry of Household Affairs, was tortured by His Majesty

20
00:00:44.333 --> 00:00:45.566
Li Feng exiled to the frontier

21
00:00:45.566 --> 00:00:48.200
So that thousands of people could see him

22
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:49.766
Have you ever

23
00:00:49.866 --> 00:00:52.700
Did you see any signs of torture on him?

24
00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.100
It seems not.

25
00:00:55.366 --> 00:00:56.833
Even without these

26
00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:58.300
You robbed the mother

27
00:00:58.466 --> 00:01:01.966
At this time, the concubine threw herself into the river and committed suicide, is it always true?

28
00:01:01.966 --> 00:01:03.100
Nonsense

29
00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.966
When have I ever done something like this?

30
00:01:05.966 --> 00:01:07.900
This is well known all over the world

31
00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:09.200
You can't deny it

32
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.566
In your eyes, is the princess already dead?

33
00:01:12.566 --> 00:01:13.900
Naturally dead

34
00:01:13.933 --> 00:01:15.866
Princess Su Haixuan

35
00:01:15.866 --> 00:01:17.300
Princess Xuan

36
00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:19.833
Introduce

37
00:01:20.133 --> 00:01:24.433
This is the princess you call

38
00:01:24.866 --> 00:01:25.700
That's not possible.

39
00:01:26.166 --> 00:01:29.100
You must be looking for anyone to lie to us.

40
00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.633
Full of nonsense

41
00:01:31.333 --> 00:01:33.833
You ask this Manchu Dynasty civil and military

42
00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.300
Is he a princess?

43
00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:45.500
Why did you hit someone?
