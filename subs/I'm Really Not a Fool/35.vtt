1
00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.766
Great joy, great joy

2
00:00:02.933 --> 00:00:04.666
Where does joy come from?

3
00:00:04.733 --> 00:00:08.600
Nearly 30 officials were copied from the palace and its four books

4
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:10.900
Manluo is Li Si's confidant

5
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.100
Copied nearly 30 million taels of silver.

6
00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:16.833
Haha, I didn't expect this group of abyss

7
00:00:17.166 --> 00:00:19.433
They know how to interrogate.

8
00:00:19.666 --> 00:00:22.033
How can the army know the way of interrogation?

9
00:00:22.066 --> 00:00:23.800
Nothing more than inventing some kind of planing

10
00:00:23.966 --> 00:00:26.066
Vegetable basin temporary execution

11
00:00:26.166 --> 00:00:28.266
The means are extremely cruel

12
00:00:28.266 --> 00:00:32.033
It was only through these that Li Feng's confession was obtained

13
00:00:32.366 --> 00:00:33.566
OK

14
00:00:34.166 --> 00:00:37.300
But Qin Yuan is not only incompetent in marriage, but also cruel

15
00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.500
At that time, this king will be able to name

16
00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.066
Replace it with righteousness

17
00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.033
Hahahahaha

18
00:00:45.133 --> 00:00:46.766
The officials who were arrested

19
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.166
Now in that prison

20
00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.433
Get someone to tell them to give their mouth to the truth

21
00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:56.533
Stricter than that is the punishment invented by the faint king

22
00:00:56.533 --> 00:00:58.700
I'm afraid not many people can handle it.

23
00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.000
If you can't bear it, you have to bear it

24
00:01:02.166 --> 00:01:05.766
Let them choose whether to die or one is full

25
00:01:06.133 --> 00:01:08.833
Yes, I understand.

26
00:01:09.066 --> 00:01:10.100
Report to the Prime Minister

27
00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.366
The emperor only used the overloaded money to see Yaotai

28
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.800
Humph

29
00:01:17.366 --> 00:01:18.666
What tea greed

30
00:01:18.933 --> 00:01:21.100
Obviously trying to take advantage of the opportunity to make money

31
00:01:21.266 --> 00:01:24.366
Construct Judaism for your own enjoyment

32
00:01:25.333 --> 00:01:28.000
Prime Minister, how nice is this?

33
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.833
At that time, there will be another reason to abolish Junjun
