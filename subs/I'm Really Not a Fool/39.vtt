1
00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:03.200
Wenxue, you finally got what you wanted

2
00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:04.666
I should have said the other way around.

3
00:00:04.666 --> 00:00:07.166
Who did the tricks one by one last night?

4
00:00:07.166 --> 00:00:09.333
It made my waist sore, that stinky rascal

5
00:00:09.333 --> 00:00:10.700
You are just greedy for my body

6
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.766
The beauty of the concubine is inconvenient

7
00:00:13.166 --> 00:00:15.000
If I don't want your body

8
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.366
Not a man anymore

9
00:00:16.866 --> 00:00:17.966
You want to compensate me

10
00:00:17.966 --> 00:00:20.100
Yes, feel free to mention any compensation you want.

11
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.100
Leave the money for building Yaotai to me

12
00:00:23.566 --> 00:00:24.466
Can you keep an account?

13
00:00:24.466 --> 00:00:26.000
No, I can learn.

14
00:00:26.133 --> 00:00:29.966
Yes, I happen to have a set of double-entry bookkeeping

15
00:00:29.966 --> 00:00:30.700
I can give it to you.

16
00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:32.033
Do you still manage the accounts?

17
00:00:32.066 --> 00:00:33.400
I love the Son of Heaven

18
00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.500
What doesn't matter?

19
00:00:35.766 --> 00:00:37.066
Anyway, just remember one thing

20
00:00:37.066 --> 00:00:38.966
The core of this Fuji bookkeeping payment is

21
00:00:38.966 --> 00:00:40.266
Where there is a loan, there must be a loan

22
00:00:40.266 --> 00:00:41.700
Borrowing must be equal

23
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.566
I didn't expect you to have some real skills

24
00:00:44.566 --> 00:00:46.066
I don't just have real skills

25
00:00:46.066 --> 00:00:48.066
That's a real deal.

26
00:00:48.066 --> 00:00:51.533
There are talents in this world. Once I monopolize the nine dou

27
00:00:51.533 --> 00:00:52.833
Other mediocre people share

28
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:54.800
I don't think we can talk today

29
00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.200
Said you were fat and you were still panting

30
00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.500
I'm just telling the truth

31
00:00:58.533 --> 00:01:00.100
Then why do you want to be a fool?

32
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.800
These civil and military officials feel that they are greater than the crowd

33
00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.833
The Ming Dynasty was flourishing

34
00:01:05.966 --> 00:01:07.366
It's bigger than the malfunction.

35
00:01:07.366 --> 00:01:08.166
Chickens have been around for a long time

36
00:01:08.166 --> 00:01:09.400
The country has long been

37
00:01:09.933 --> 00:01:10.300
Zhenggu

38
00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:13.966
How to fight against the upright gentleman in the court

39
00:01:14.466 --> 00:01:15.266
Your Majesty

40
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:19.700
Your Majesty

41
00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.566
King Jing brings together Shandong and Guannongmenfa clan to meet

42
00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:26.100
publicity

43
00:01:26.366 --> 00:01:29.900
Shandong and Guan Nongmenfa Clan
