00:00:01.366 --> 00:00:04.866
Dean Shen Quan, Saburo Aoi, Anmi Tianzi

2
00:00:04.866 --> 00:00:07.400
Why should I be far away in Liaodong?

3
00:00:07.666 --> 00:00:10.000
Want to kiss more than the emperor

4
00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.766
They are stupid and incompetent.

5
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.400
When I saw the ruins today, I really said

6
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.566
How dare you insult my emperor

7
00:00:19.133 --> 00:00:20.800
Did I slander the emperor?

8
00:00:20.866 --> 00:00:21.933
Open your eyes.

9
00:00:21.933 --> 00:00:24.433
Look at what you stupid king is doing

10
00:00:24.566 --> 00:00:27.366
Your celestial husband is not the most reasonable

11
00:00:27.366 --> 00:00:28.800
The monarch of a country

12
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.366
Take the wrong minister

13
00:00:30.366 --> 00:00:32.800
And they go up and down in a grand manner

14
00:00:32.933 --> 00:00:33.966
lose face

15
00:00:34.733 --> 00:00:36.066
Hmm, that's right

16
00:00:36.066 --> 00:00:38.766
A mess like you should give way

17
00:00:38.766 --> 00:00:41.000
Hahaha abdicate and give way

18
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.266
Who in the world is more virtuous than me?

19
00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.600
Humming an incompetent mess and calling it virtuous

20
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:48.966
It's a family name

21
00:00:48.966 --> 00:00:51.766
Find a pig in the pigsty that is more idle than you

22
00:00:51.766 --> 00:00:55.600
In this way, I only know that I am drunk all day

23
00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.366
Hanada wine wilderness

24
00:00:57.866 --> 00:01:00.133
Absolutely first class trash

25
00:01:00.133 --> 00:01:01.633
The emperor is bold

26
00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.600
You dare to insult my man, you dragged me out and cut it

27
00:01:07.333 --> 00:01:08.766
Ah, your majesty, Xiru

28
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.400
The two countries have never been at war.

29
00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.866
Are you the only one who dares to kill me?

30
00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:15.566
I need 300,000 army

31
00:01:15.566 --> 00:01:16.700
Soldiers move

32
00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.166
Prancing horse whip at any time

33
00:01:18.166 --> 00:01:19.366
It's hard to beat

34
00:01:19.366 --> 00:01:20.800
Sword refers to heavy rain

35
00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:25.000
If you dare to threaten me, it is dangerous

36
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:27.900
Could it be that you dare to kill me?

37
00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.966
This dim lord refers to the tiger

38
00:01:33.066 --> 00:01:34.000
Useless

39
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:34.400
I check

40
00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.666
The emperor turned out to be just a straw knife with cruel words

41
00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.266
You think I dare not

42
00:01:41.733 --> 00:01:44.866
Come here, don't make me look down on you

43
00:01:44.866 --> 00:01:45.900
There is no crime

44
00:01:45.933 --> 00:01:47.800
Never kill His Majesty
