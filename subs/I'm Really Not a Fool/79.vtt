1
00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:02.866
Because this business makes money

2
00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:06.366
The pigs rolling in the middle are all getting into the eyes of money

3
00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.066
You use them to govern the country

4
00:00:08.066 --> 00:00:09.533
He also said that he was not a fool

5
00:00:09.533 --> 00:00:11.800
We all have desires.

6
00:00:11.966 --> 00:00:14.166
Or greed for fame or power

7
00:00:14.166 --> 00:00:16.233
Or greedy or lustful

8
00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:18.766
It is normal for officials to love money

9
00:00:19.266 --> 00:00:21.566
You are encouraging officials to be corrupt and take bribes.

10
00:00:22.066 --> 00:00:23.533
If officials take bribes

11
00:00:23.533 --> 00:00:25.833
What about self-owned imperial history supervision?

12
00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.933
If it is verified to be true, you can restore it if you want.

13
00:00:28.933 --> 00:00:30.400
What can I do without it?

14
00:00:30.666 --> 00:00:32.166
You even use corrupt officials

15
00:00:32.366 --> 00:00:33.766
It's not a fool

16
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.100
Then I ask you

17
00:00:35.133 --> 00:00:38.066
How many honest officials have there been throughout the ages?

18
00:00:38.066 --> 00:00:39.566
How many corrupt officials are there?

19
00:00:40.333 --> 00:00:42.300
Honest officials are rare

20
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:43.566
Few

21
00:00:43.733 --> 00:00:45.566
Corrupt officials are like the killing of the Yellow River

22
00:00:45.566 --> 00:00:46.800
invincible

23
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.166
I ask you again

24
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.000
Honest officials must be good

25
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.900
Corrupt officials must be broken

26
00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:53.800
Honest officials are naturally good

27
00:00:53.933 --> 00:00:55.800
Corrupt officials are naturally bad

28
00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.300
Integrity is just integrity

29
00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.066
Doesn't mean he can do things

30
00:00:59.166 --> 00:01:01.333
I want to be an official

31
00:01:01.333 --> 00:01:03.100
People on the rich side

32
00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:04.600
I am not afraid of their corruption

33
00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.266
I'm not afraid that they will dissolve the party

34
00:01:06.333 --> 00:01:09.000
What I am afraid of is not seeking a job in his position

35
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.966
Those who sit in the pit and don't shit

36
00:01:12.533 --> 00:01:14.100
Even if what you say makes sense

37
00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.633
Isn't it a fact that you gun people and harm people?
