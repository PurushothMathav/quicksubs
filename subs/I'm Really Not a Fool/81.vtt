00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.233
Your Majesty, you are so handsome today

2
00:00:02.266 --> 00:00:04.666
It's rare to have a beloved concubine praise me for a day

3
00:00:04.766 --> 00:00:08.166
By the way, Your Majesty, do you really want to use corrupt officials to govern the country?

4
00:00:08.466 --> 00:00:09.666
Yangtze River clear water

5
00:00:09.666 --> 00:00:10.766
Yellow River turbidity

6
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.966
But ah, the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers

7
00:00:12.966 --> 00:00:15.966
Can irrigate millions of acres of heaven and earth on both sides

8
00:00:15.966 --> 00:00:18.433
Therefore, the name Shuiqing is preferred

9
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.266
The water is turbid and wasteful.

10
00:00:21.333 --> 00:00:25.066
However, once the trend of corrupt officials and mistaken the country is formed

11
00:00:25.066 --> 00:00:27.466
What if the people can't bear the oppression and rebel?

12
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.133
When the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers flood

13
00:00:29.133 --> 00:00:30.333
We all need governance

14
00:00:30.333 --> 00:00:32.833
It's like punishing corrupt officials.

15
00:00:32.933 --> 00:00:34.900
I'm looking for an opportunity

16
00:00:35.366 --> 00:00:36.566
Find this corrupt official

17
00:00:36.566 --> 00:00:37.766
Kill the chicken to make it red

18
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.366
So His Majesty wants to kill a batch every three to five

19
00:00:42.366 --> 00:00:43.700
To face others squarely

20
00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:44.766
Look at history.

21
00:00:44.766 --> 00:00:47.433
Where there is power, there is corruption.

22
00:00:47.466 --> 00:00:48.600
It can't be cured.

23
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.800
In the era of inspirational clarity?

24
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.833
And there's some of that.

25
00:00:53.666 --> 00:00:56.733
This is like a wave of chives

26
00:00:56.733 --> 00:00:57.966
Can't kill it all

27
00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.200
It's actually pretty good

28
00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:01.733
How can this be good?

29
00:01:01.733 --> 00:01:04.400
You see, the people are divided into great things

30
00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:05.900
I killed a corrupt official

31
00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:09.100
Maintain social stability in the name of the environment

32
00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:10.933
By the way, I can also copy the home of a corrupt official

33
00:01:10.933 --> 00:01:13.500
The money didn't go back to the court in the end

34
00:01:13.533 --> 00:01:16.266
Your Majesty, this is to raise fish

35
00:01:16.566 --> 00:01:20.466
Sister, this guy is really bad

36
00:01:22.133 --> 00:01:24.500
It gets worse.

37
00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.600
Prime Minister, we have been fooled

38
00:01:28.666 --> 00:01:30.466
The emperor left us in the palace

39
00:01:30.766 --> 00:01:33.400
Take the opportunity to march on the hanging horse

40
00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:37.100
Now we can't control the march

41
00:01:37.133 --> 00:01:38.633
I didn't expect it.

42
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.466
This pig day geese

43
00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.366
But was caught by Yan

44
00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.433
The old man was actually fooled by a fool

45
00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.500
Hey, Junjun is too good at acting

46
00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:52.066
But what should Chen Shao do now?

47
00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:53.466
Fight like an old woman

48
00:01:54.533 --> 00:01:55.900
He's still so little

49
00:01:56.466 --> 00:01:57.266
Prime Minister

50
00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:59.700
About to settle down
