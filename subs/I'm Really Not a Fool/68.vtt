1
00:00:04.366 --> 00:00:05.400
Wish love

2
00:00:06.166 --> 00:00:07.066
This fruit room

3
00:00:07.066 --> 00:00:10.433
Persimmons surround the gate of the imperial city, but they argue

4
00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:12.300
What should I do?

5
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:16.200
Your Majesty

6
00:00:16.766 --> 00:00:18.466
Knocking outside the womb

7
00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:19.700
Attack the government

8
00:00:20.166 --> 00:00:21.566
proposal

9
00:00:21.566 --> 00:00:23.466
Loyal to defend the country

10
00:00:23.666 --> 00:00:25.166
His heart can be expressed

11
00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:26.500
Prime Minister

12
00:00:27.066 --> 00:00:29.500
I'm asking you how to solve it

13
00:00:29.733 --> 00:00:31.700
Don't go around in circles for me here

14
00:00:32.366 --> 00:00:33.166
Anzhi

15
00:00:33.766 --> 00:00:35.366
Kouque outside the womb

16
00:00:35.533 --> 00:00:38.133
His Majesty must accept

17
00:00:38.133 --> 00:00:40.766
Is there no room for manoeuvre?

18
00:00:41.133 --> 00:00:44.500
No, either His Majesty promised them

19
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.900
Or His Majesty will punish him from the crowd

20
00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:47.833
melee

21
00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:50.533
They asked me to convict myself, Zhao

22
00:00:50.533 --> 00:00:51.833
I also listen to them

23
00:00:52.533 --> 00:00:55.266
Your Majesty, now I am greater than the country

24
00:00:55.266 --> 00:00:56.466
Frequent natural disasters

25
00:00:56.466 --> 00:00:57.666
Wars everywhere

26
00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:59.100
rape

27
00:00:59.466 --> 00:01:02.166
Prime Minister, what does this mean?

28
00:01:02.766 --> 00:01:05.400
I think Your Majesty is guilty now

29
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.633
Review your own mistakes

30
00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.300
It's okay to ask God for forgiveness

31
00:01:12.066 --> 00:01:13.500
The prime minister's words are bad

32
00:01:14.333 --> 00:01:16.200
I am the Son of Heaven

33
00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:17.600
How could it be wrong?

34
00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:19.433
Your Majesty

35
00:01:20.366 --> 00:01:24.800
Shangyun Youyun's 20,000 parties are guilty of one person

36
00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.300
A man is guilty without an ear

37
00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:30.000
All people are wrong

38
00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:32.400
The Son of Heaven is now sinful

39
00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.400
The people are wrong, it's their fault

40
00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.066
Make them admit their mistakes

41
00:01:36.066 --> 00:01:37.200
What does it have to do with me?

42
00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.433
I don't take this pot

43
00:01:38.666 --> 00:01:42.766
Your Majesty, all dynasties and kings have sinned against themselves

44
00:01:42.766 --> 00:01:43.766
They are them

45
00:01:43.766 --> 00:01:44.866
I am I

46
00:01:45.866 --> 00:01:48.800
I am a wise king from ancient times to the present

47
00:01:49.066 --> 00:01:51.266
How could it be wrong?

48
00:01:51.566 --> 00:01:54.600
Now the prince is diligent and hard-working

49
00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.266
A little careless

50
00:01:56.333 --> 00:01:58.800
Kong Liang became a disaster

51
00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:00.866
I'd like to see what disaster it can cause

52
00:02:00.866 --> 00:02:02.233
Where is the marching leader?
