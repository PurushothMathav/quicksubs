00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:02.266
If you promise to sleep with me tonight

2
00:00:02.533 --> 00:00:03.666
I will tell you

3
00:00:10.133 --> 00:00:11.866
I am newly married to the queen

4
00:00:11.866 --> 00:00:14.066
I can't help it.

5
00:00:14.066 --> 00:00:15.466
Snubbed this lover

6
00:00:15.466 --> 00:00:17.466
Just ask.

7
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:19.200
More time.

8
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.700
Has the queen come up with an answer?

9
00:00:21.733 --> 00:00:22.666
Dare to ask your history

10
00:00:23.133 --> 00:00:24.766
There are several answers to this question

11
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.566
One obviously has three

12
00:00:26.566 --> 00:00:29.800
Impossible my queen cannot be wrong

13
00:00:29.866 --> 00:00:31.800
You must be mistaken.

14
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.000
It must be your fault, why don't we take another gamble?

15
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.266
If you are wrong

16
00:00:36.266 --> 00:00:37.066
I

17
00:00:37.166 --> 00:00:38.733
Drowned you

18
00:00:38.733 --> 00:00:40.466
If the queen is wrong

19
00:00:40.466 --> 00:00:43.666
How about I cede the Yan Yun porridge to you?

20
00:00:43.933 --> 00:00:45.066
Zihua seriously

21
00:00:45.166 --> 00:00:46.966
Really impossible

22
00:00:46.966 --> 00:00:47.700
Your Majesty

23
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.166
The Land of Yanyun is the Central Plains. Once Mongolia dies

24
00:00:51.466 --> 00:00:54.166
The Central Plains is called Bloodless

25
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.466
Big Blue even dares to question the queen

26
00:00:56.466 --> 00:00:57.700
Do you want to rebel?

27
00:00:57.766 --> 00:00:58.800
Your Majesty

28
00:00:59.533 --> 00:01:02.866
My heart of China can be learned from the sun and the moon

29
00:01:02.866 --> 00:01:04.900
If I hadn't seen the concubine

30
00:01:05.333 --> 00:01:07.366
I will replace you with the Fa-rectification today.

31
00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.466
Do you really want to leave then?

32
00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.800
My word is good

33
00:01:14.266 --> 00:01:17.100
Then let the queen tell the answer

34
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.666
Everyone is free to judge

35
00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:20.966
The queen told him

36
00:01:21.066 --> 00:01:24.166
20 three two three three three eight

37
00:01:24.266 --> 00:01:29.300
Twenty-three, two, three, three, three, eight. Did you hear that?

38
00:01:35.466 --> 00:01:36.266
That's not possible.

39
00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:40.300
Your Majesty, the Queen's answer is absolutely correct.

40
00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:41.600
Congratulations, Your Majesty

41
00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:42.933
Congratulations to the Queen

42
00:01:42.933 --> 00:01:45.600
Two beloved concubines made contributions to the country today

43
00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.300
I will reward you well tonight.

44
00:01:49.866 --> 00:01:52.200
Somebody drag him down for me

45
00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.333
Send it to the room and flood him

46
00:01:54.333 --> 00:01:55.466
Then send the mirror

47
00:01:55.466 --> 00:01:59.133
Oh, and don't forget to bring the queen of our country

48
00:01:59.133 --> 00:02:01.300
Be my house girl
