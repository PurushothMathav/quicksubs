1
00:00:00.566 --> 00:00:02.366
I will shoot you

2
00:00:02.466 --> 00:00:04.366
Where did this start?

3
00:00:04.366 --> 00:00:05.533
Jiangnan flood

4
00:00:05.533 --> 00:00:09.600
Is it the next time you use Maifu rice bran for disaster relief?

5
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:11.600
Isn't this what Junjun did?

6
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:12.800
History of floods in Jiangnan

7
00:00:12.933 --> 00:00:14.266
The national treasury is short of grain

8
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.200
I also heard that one catty of rice can be exchanged for three catties of Maeve.

9
00:00:17.966 --> 00:00:19.200
Only out of the disaster

10
00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.366
Food for one person

11
00:00:21.533 --> 00:00:23.166
3 now.

12
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.566
Then you force the people to build the Shengsendai Yaotai explosion house

13
00:00:27.566 --> 00:00:29.700
It's always enslaving the people

14
00:00:29.933 --> 00:00:30.700
coincidence

15
00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:33.766
The people who happened to build the explosion house in Shengsendai Yaochi

16
00:00:33.766 --> 00:00:36.633
Give me an umbrella today

17
00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:40.233
Why don't you ask him what Su Haixuan's solution is?

18
00:00:40.733 --> 00:00:43.200
Propagate the realm of the common people

19
00:00:50.466 --> 00:00:53.233
Two, some people say that I enslave

20
00:00:53.533 --> 00:00:55.666
You come and tell them that I

21
00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:57.166
Is it true?

22
00:00:57.866 --> 00:00:58.700
Nonsense

23
00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:59.866
It belongs to the mouth full of cracks

24
00:00:59.866 --> 00:01:02.266
Dare to slander since ancient times

25
00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.433
True cutting and swaying are all people who bring their own food

26
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.400
Which emperor would send money to the people?

27
00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:08.500
What money to send

28
00:01:08.866 --> 00:01:12.233
We build Shengsendai Yaotai explosion house

29
00:01:12.333 --> 00:01:14.766
You can get two or three taels of silver every month

30
00:01:14.933 --> 00:01:16.800
Enough to feed a family for three or four months

31
00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:17.933
If this is friendship

32
00:01:17.933 --> 00:01:20.066
Then we are willing to be friends for a lifetime

33
00:01:20.133 --> 00:01:22.066
The underground has been the Ming army for thousands of years

34
00:01:22.133 --> 00:01:25.100
We are waiting for the realization of the kindness of the people
