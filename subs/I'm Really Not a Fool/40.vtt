00:00:01.666 --> 00:00:05.666
I have seen what the two of you came to say

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.400
Caomin represents Shandong and Guanlongmenfa clan

3
00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:12.400
Ask Your Majesty to stop the imperial examination

4
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.500
Re-adoption of the building system

5
00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:16.100
Strike imperial examination system

6
00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:18.800
This imperial examination system was created by the previous emperor

7
00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:22.566
Are you two going to be trapped in unfilial piety?

8
00:00:22.933 --> 00:00:26.166
The royal family shares the world with the Menfah clan

9
00:00:26.166 --> 00:00:27.900
It's been the rule since time immemorial.

10
00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.300
Broke the rules first

11
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.400
Your Majesty should disrupt the government

12
00:00:31.866 --> 00:00:32.900
What rules?

13
00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:34.200
Why haven't you heard of this?

14
00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:38.066
Your Majesty, have you heard of the Millennium Family?

15
00:00:38.066 --> 00:00:39.166
Centennial Dynasty

16
00:00:39.666 --> 00:00:40.800
I heard a little

17
00:00:41.266 --> 00:00:45.400
Then Your Majesty knows why the aristocratic family has not fallen for thousands of years

18
00:00:46.466 --> 00:00:48.466
Because the aristocratic family owns the books

19
00:00:48.466 --> 00:00:52.566
Only children of literary families can read rationally

20
00:00:52.566 --> 00:00:55.666
Only when emperors govern the country and have a good helper

21
00:00:55.666 --> 00:00:56.366
You two are really

22
00:00:56.366 --> 00:00:59.433
I want to rely on the books in the hands of the aristocratic family

23
00:01:00.966 --> 00:01:02.866
It's still dangerous, yeah

24
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.533
Just a book

25
00:01:04.533 --> 00:01:07.200
I have as much as I want

26
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.066
Toad yawned

27
00:01:09.066 --> 00:01:10.533
What a big breath

28
00:01:10.533 --> 00:01:13.400
Even papermaking was controlled by the Menvar clan

29
00:01:13.766 --> 00:01:17.400
You can have as many as you want.

30
00:01:20.533 --> 00:01:21.766
Oh, dear.

31
00:01:24.866 --> 00:01:27.033
Let me leave a hundred homes

32
00:01:27.266 --> 00:01:29.266
It's not impossible.

33
00:01:29.866 --> 00:01:31.500
But I have one condition

34
00:01:31.733 --> 00:01:33.800
What is your Majesty's request?

35
00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.566
I heard that the strange flower of Yangzhou has been established

36
00:01:36.733 --> 00:01:38.300
And beautiful women like clouds

37
00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.466
I want to build a canal to reach Yangzhou

38
00:01:41.666 --> 00:01:43.700
30 million taels of silver are still missing

39
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.900
30 million taels, why don't you grab it?

40
00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:47.133
If you don't give

41
00:01:47.133 --> 00:01:49.333
I have held imperial examinations for three consecutive years

42
00:01:49.333 --> 00:01:53.666
Every year, 3,000 people are admitted from the poor and the numbers

43
00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:55.633
How dare you
