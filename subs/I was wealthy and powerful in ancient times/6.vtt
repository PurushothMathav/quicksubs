Why should adults care too much?

Everybody in the room brought me a bowl.

00:00:30.133 --> 00:00:31.300
Not easy.

14
00:00:31.333 --> 00:00:34.200

Husband, you are amazing.

21
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:52.800
The first pot of gold is in hand

22
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.966
Next I'm going to turn the sky upside down

00:00:54.966 --> 00:00:56.966
