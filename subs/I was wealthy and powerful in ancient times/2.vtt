00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.200
What do you mean?

2
00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:02.333
If you don't choose, you don't choose

3
00:00:02.333 --> 00:00:05.066
You stinky reader, teach me a lesson

4
00:00:05.166 --> 00:00:06.000
Have a choice

5
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.100
I choose I choose

6
00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:08.000
I choose him.

7
00:00:08.666 --> 00:00:10.900
You are serious

8
00:00:10.966 --> 00:00:12.800
Of course not.

9
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.366
He's a disaster.

10
00:00:15.333 --> 00:00:17.833
Okay, that's the end of today's kiss

11
00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:21.666
Thank you for not disliking it.

12
00:00:21.666 --> 00:00:23.800
I will definitely be a cow and a horse to repay the officials.

13
00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:24.666
Get up!

14
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:29.000
Ah!

15
00:00:29.966 --> 00:00:32.600
By the way, I still have one or two years old silver.

16
00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.766
It was left to me before my mother passed away

17
00:00:34.766 --> 00:00:36.933
Take it and buy some broken rice.

18
00:00:36.933 --> 00:00:37.766
No no

19
00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:40.400
How can a man spend a woman's money?

20
00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.066
Don't worry, you will make money in the future, and I will support you.

21
00:00:46.166 --> 00:00:48.466
Lin Yi, get out of here

22
00:00:48.466 --> 00:00:50.166
Village Chief Qin Ling's

23
00:00:50.166 --> 00:00:51.366
You don't listen to the village chief's advice

24
00:00:51.466 --> 00:00:53.266
I have to bring this disaster back

25
00:00:53.366 --> 00:00:54.800
He will kill our entire village

26
00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.100
Folks, we have to get him out of the village

27
00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.733
To protect our village

28
00:00:58.733 --> 00:01:00.600
Get out get out

29
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.000
Get out get out

30
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.766
Don't come here

31
00:01:02.766 --> 00:01:03.733
Can you roll?

32
00:01:03.733 --> 00:01:05.333
I won't even come over if I fight with you

33
00:01:05.333 --> 00:01:06.466
Don't come and stop fighting

34
00:01:07.166 --> 00:01:08.566
I think I'd better go

35
00:01:08.666 --> 00:01:11.233
I don't want to cause trouble to the officials.

36
00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:12.500
I'll tell you what.

37
00:01:12.733 --> 00:01:14.066
What about me, Lin Yi?

38
00:01:14.133 --> 00:01:16.366
I don't want to stay in this broken village for a long time

39
00:01:16.366 --> 00:01:17.833
Lady let's go

40
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.300
How about tonight?

41
00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:24.466
Let's deal with it in this dilapidated temple

42
00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:25.766
Let me tell you something.

43
00:01:25.866 --> 00:01:28.266
My forestry will definitely make a lot of money

44
00:01:28.266 --> 00:01:30.233
Then marry you back in style

45
00:01:30.333 --> 00:01:32.600
I'm going to let those people know when the time comes.

46
00:01:32.733 --> 00:01:34.266
You are not only not my disaster

47
00:01:34.266 --> 00:01:35.366
Still my lucky star
