00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.366
Hey two small

2
00:00:01.366 --> 00:00:03.500
I asked you to drop off this week's estate and come over

3
00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:04.700
Will you blame me?

4
00:00:04.766 --> 00:00:06.400
What did you say, shopkeeper?

5
00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.833
My second child can have today because of you.

6
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:09.900
Tell you what?

7
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.400
This Li Rongfa from Jiangnan Road

8
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:12.366
Not good at anything

9
00:00:12.366 --> 00:00:13.300
Not easy to deal with

10
00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:14.200
No matter how difficult it is to deal with

11
00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:15.933
It's a piece of cake for you

12
00:00:15.933 --> 00:00:17.033
By the way, the shopkeeper

13
00:00:17.066 --> 00:00:19.333
I have calculated all the profits for the past few months

14
00:00:19.333 --> 00:00:21.700
It's 30% higher than we expected

15
00:00:22.366 --> 00:00:25.266
This is Li Rongfa, give me a taste of sweetness

16
00:00:25.366 --> 00:00:26.500
Since he wants to give

17
00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.266
Then I'll do what he wants.

18
00:00:28.533 --> 00:00:29.933
Add an investment

19
00:00:29.933 --> 00:00:32.733
Swallow him together, and the market counts.

20
00:00:32.733 --> 00:00:34.466
We have to expand before we can hold on to it.

21
00:00:34.466 --> 00:00:35.533
Would it be too fast?

22
00:00:35.533 --> 00:00:37.366
Oops this is exactly what I want

23
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:38.700
Since he dug a hole for me

24
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.166
Then I'll dig a hole for him, right?

25
00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.300
The recipe for this milk tea

26
00:00:44.333 --> 00:00:46.266
Take the opportunity to leak it to Li Ronghua

27
00:00:46.266 --> 00:00:47.733
Shopkeeper, what are you doing?

28
00:00:47.733 --> 00:00:51.066
Don't ask about freedom, plan to go, okay?

29
00:00:54.333 --> 00:00:55.833
President President

30
00:00:56.133 --> 00:00:57.333
So what's up?

31
00:00:57.333 --> 00:00:59.900
A frizzy happy event

32
00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:01.000
And guess what?

33
00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:02.400
Speak quickly

34
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:03.666
Don't sell it

35
00:01:03.666 --> 00:01:05.766
Haven't you always wanted the recipe for this milk tea?

36
00:01:05.766 --> 00:01:07.733
A worker who makes milk tea came to the restaurant in Linshi

37
00:01:07.733 --> 00:01:10.300
To sell us this recipe
