00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.500
Hey, okay, okay.

2
00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:03.233
Can you please stop talking nonsense?

3
00:00:03.333 --> 00:00:06.166
Now this Wang Qianju has been solved by me.

4
00:00:06.166 --> 00:00:08.666
My business has stabilized within a week

5
00:00:08.666 --> 00:00:09.700
I promise you.

6
00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:10.800
From now on

7
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.766
I won't let you get hurt again

8
00:00:12.766 --> 00:00:14.200
Okay? Hmm?

9
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.733
Are you the owner of this restaurant?

10
00:00:22.733 --> 00:00:24.800
I am the owner of this hotel

11
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.500
Are you looking for me?

12
00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.766
I want to rent your restaurant

13
00:00:29.766 --> 00:00:31.366
How about you?

14
00:00:31.466 --> 00:00:34.166
Hahaha, son.

15
00:00:34.166 --> 00:00:35.066
Just kidding

16
00:00:35.066 --> 00:00:37.200
My restaurant is doing well

17
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.600
At least 2,000 taels per month

18
00:00:39.666 --> 00:00:40.766
No, why?

19
00:00:40.766 --> 00:00:44.066
Then I'll give you 2,000 taels of rent every month

20
00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:45.000
how

21
00:00:45.533 --> 00:00:47.000
2,000 taels a month.

22
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.166
Just want to rent me this wine

23
00:00:48.333 --> 00:00:49.600
That's right.

24
00:00:49.733 --> 00:00:52.500
I will rent your restaurant in the future

25
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.466
Young man, you seem like a rich boy

26
00:00:55.466 --> 00:00:56.633
Just this money

27
00:00:56.766 --> 00:00:59.033
It can't be taken out casually.

28
00:00:59.566 --> 00:01:01.233
It's not whether you do it or not

29
00:01:01.366 --> 00:01:04.700
You really are not playing with me, as long as you nod your head and agree.

30
00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:05.700
Let's sign and bet

31
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.300
From now on, you will receive 2,000 taels from me every month

32
00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:10.466
Interview, this is what you said?

33
00:01:10.466 --> 00:01:11.200
No regrets

34
00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.000
I'll tell you what.

35
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.366
If you can't come up with the money

36
00:01:13.366 --> 00:01:14.666
I'm not renting it to you.

37
00:01:14.866 --> 00:01:16.433
OK, OK, OK. Got it.

38
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:19.800
OK

39
00:01:20.566 --> 00:01:23.000
There's something I have to tell you.

40
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.900
Our state government is not easy to serve

41
00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:27.800
If you want to open a store safely

42
00:01:27.966 --> 00:01:30.700
You'd better go to the pier first
