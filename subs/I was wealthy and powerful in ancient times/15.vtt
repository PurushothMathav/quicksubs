00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:01.466
Your courage is commendable

2
00:00:01.466 --> 00:00:01.966
What about later?

3
00:00:01.966 --> 00:00:05.000
I'll give you the recipe for the restaurant and crayfish

4
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:05.933
As long as you do a good job

5
00:00:05.933 --> 00:00:09.300
All the profits will be given to you one game at a time.

6
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.666
As long as you do a good job, the more I give

7
00:00:12.133 --> 00:00:13.166
Don't worry.

8
00:00:13.166 --> 00:00:14.800
I will definitely make the crayfish business

9
00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:15.866
More and more popular

10
00:00:15.866 --> 00:00:18.633
Wife, I have a surprise for you

11
00:00:19.066 --> 00:00:20.466
Dangdang Dangdang

12
00:00:21.933 --> 00:00:24.233
How does it feel to be rich?

13
00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:26.800
Husband, you are amazing

14
00:00:27.733 --> 00:00:28.800
Oh, right.

15
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.866
I may have to be away for a while

16
00:00:33.133 --> 00:00:34.266
Where do you intend to go?

17
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.300
Are you going to stop wanting me?

18
00:00:39.333 --> 00:00:40.200
Do you dislike

19
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.400
The food I cook is not to your taste.

20
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.133
Or the bath water I prepared for you?

21
00:00:44.133 --> 00:00:45.500
Do you think the temperature is not suitable?

22
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.900
Husband, tell me I can make it

23
00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:49.200
What are you thinking about?

24
00:00:49.333 --> 00:00:51.533
I just want to go somewhere else to sell crayfish

25
00:00:51.533 --> 00:00:53.033
Just open a chain store

26
00:00:53.566 --> 00:00:56.700
Chain store? What is a chain store?

27
00:00:56.966 --> 00:00:59.633
I stopped making crayfish and sold locks instead.

28
00:01:01.466 --> 00:01:02.600
But husband

29
00:01:02.666 --> 00:01:04.900
Isn't our business doing well now?

30
00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:06.366
No matter how good this business is

31
00:01:06.366 --> 00:01:08.233
No chain store to make money

32
00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:12.000
But I don't want you to make that much money.

33
00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.000
Men go bad when they make money

34
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.200
I didn't say lady

35
00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.600
Can you stop thinking about it all day long?

36
00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.200
Have you watched too many idol dramas?

37
00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.766
Don't worry.

38
00:01:21.766 --> 00:01:24.666
Your husband will definitely love you until old age

39
00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.000
Lady, you are so beautiful today

40
00:01:38.333 --> 00:01:39.133
husband

41
00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.033
No.
