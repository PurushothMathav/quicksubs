00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.166
Hey, hey, hey.

2
00:00:01.166 --> 00:00:02.533
The adults are joking

3
00:00:02.533 --> 00:00:04.100
How could you be a troublemaker?

4
00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:05.366
It's my bad mouth

5
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:06.666
Open your mouth! Open your mouth!

6
00:00:06.666 --> 00:00:08.766
But don't, I'm really a jerk

7
00:00:08.766 --> 00:00:11.600
I am just an ordinary ordinary person

8
00:00:11.666 --> 00:00:13.133
Just an ordinary person

9
00:00:13.133 --> 00:00:14.700
Oh oh yes yes yes

10
00:00:14.866 --> 00:00:16.533
It's just an ordinary boss.

11
00:00:16.533 --> 00:00:18.500
Send Mr. Lin back to blessing

12
00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:20.533
Then I'll go, okay, okay

13
00:00:20.533 --> 00:00:22.466
Go slowly bye

14
00:00:22.466 --> 00:00:23.700
Goodbye Mr. Lin

15
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:25.866
Oh my god

16
00:00:25.933 --> 00:00:28.200
Scared me to death, my lord

17
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:29.766
Isn't it just a gold medal to avoid death?

18
00:00:29.766 --> 00:00:31.166
Scared you like this

19
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:32.966
What do you know?

20
00:00:32.966 --> 00:00:36.200
How many of you can get the gold medal of avoiding death?

21
00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:37.300
Give me back

22
00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.366
Let the people below give me peace of mind

23
00:00:39.366 --> 00:00:41.966
Wait until I check it out before making another plan

24
00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.133
Do you still want to take care of the adults?

25
00:00:44.133 --> 00:00:45.300
Beat a fart

26
00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:47.266
Don't you understand what I said?

27
00:00:47.266 --> 00:00:48.566
Hurry up and do it

28
00:00:48.566 --> 00:00:51.466
Got it, you scared me to death, Boss Lin.

29
00:00:51.466 --> 00:00:53.600
Your restaurant business is really good, isn't it?

30
00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.200
I have robbed so many customers in just a few days.

31
00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.133
Especially the milk tea that just launched

32
00:00:58.133 --> 00:00:59.466
Business is booming.

33
00:00:59.466 --> 00:01:01.466
Hahaha, where is it, Boss Li?

34
00:01:01.466 --> 00:01:03.500
It's not because of the location of this restaurant

35
00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.166
Just attracted so many customers

36
00:01:06.166 --> 00:01:09.333
There's something I want to discuss with you. Okay

37
00:01:09.333 --> 00:01:11.600
Tell me, the rent for this restaurant

38
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.333
I want to go up to 3,000 taels every month

39
00:01:14.333 --> 00:01:15.433
What do you think?
