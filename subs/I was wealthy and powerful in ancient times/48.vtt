00:00:00.666 --> 00:00:02.900
3,000 taels is too much, right?

2
00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:04.333
Didn't we agree before?

3
00:00:04.333 --> 00:00:07.633
2,000 taels of music every month

4
00:00:07.966 --> 00:00:09.233
Before was before

5
00:00:09.366 --> 00:00:10.800
Now is now

6
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.500
Look at how good your restaurant business is now

7
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.333
Is it still short of my 1,000 taels?

8
00:00:15.333 --> 00:00:16.533
One yard is one yard?

9
00:00:16.533 --> 00:00:18.466
And it's written so clearly in black and white

10
00:00:18.466 --> 00:00:20.333
I can't give you money.

11
00:00:20.333 --> 00:00:21.366
You have to give.

12
00:00:21.366 --> 00:00:22.300
Give or give

13
00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.100
I won't pay you back.

14
00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:27.133
I don't rent it anymore, it's not you, please ask the leader to tell you directly.

15
00:00:27.133 --> 00:00:28.600
What kind of broken milk tea do you have?

16
00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.800
I already knew how to do it

17
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.366
Isn't it just milk and tea mixed together?

18
00:00:33.366 --> 00:00:34.866
Who wouldn't?

19
00:00:35.066 --> 00:00:37.900
Go, go, go, go to the restaurant

20
00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:39.700
I don't rent anymore

21
00:00:39.866 --> 00:00:42.500
Boss Ye, then I wish you a prosperous business.

22
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.100
I don't want the other 2,000 taels of silver either.

23
00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:47.566
Think of it as buying a coffin board for yourself

24
00:00:47.566 --> 00:00:48.800
We'll see.

25
00:00:51.166 --> 00:00:53.700
You deserve it too

26
00:00:56.966 --> 00:00:59.600
Take off the plaque of Lin's Restaurant for me and take it away

27
00:00:59.733 --> 00:01:00.500
Go to linna

28
00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.766
Stop! Why are you taking off my sign?

29
00:01:02.766 --> 00:01:04.700
The owner of this restaurant's plaque

30
00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:06.300
I designed it with my own money.

31
00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:07.166
What's with you

32
00:01:07.166 --> 00:01:08.766
You've figured it out

33
00:01:08.966 --> 00:01:10.600
If this brand is removed

34
00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.133
Our beam is dead

35
00:01:13.133 --> 00:01:14.766
You don't even think about opening a store in Bianzhou

36
00:01:14.766 --> 00:01:16.100
What about this sign today?

37
00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:17.066
I'll take it.

38
00:01:17.066 --> 00:01:19.333
Lin Yi, I remember you

39
00:01:19.333 --> 00:01:20.500
We'll see.
