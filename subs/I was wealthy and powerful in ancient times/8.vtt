1
00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:03.466
Sauce pop, iced salt, uh, and spicy

2
00:00:03.466 --> 00:00:06.766
But only you can't spit out gold, you have to eat him

3
00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:08.466
He looks so scary.

4
00:00:08.466 --> 00:00:09.666
But so hard

5
00:00:10.166 --> 00:00:11.733
Can you eat it? Of course you can

6
00:00:11.733 --> 00:00:13.333
I'll be a little boy in a while

7
00:00:13.333 --> 00:00:14.933
Give my wife a taste

8
00:00:14.933 --> 00:00:16.333
Okay? Okay?

9
00:00:16.333 --> 00:00:18.833
As long as it is made by Xianggong, I will eat it even if it is poisonous

10
00:00:19.566 --> 00:00:22.066
Lady, you are so kind to me.

11
00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:25.366
Life is just hanging up

12
00:00:25.366 --> 00:00:26.866
Earn 100 taels casually

13
00:00:26.866 --> 00:00:28.800
It also led me to discover that the ancient people did not eat crayfish

14
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.833
Isn't this just God sending money?

15
00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:32.866
Take a look. Take a look.

16
00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:35.333
Freshly baked spicy crayfish

17
00:00:35.333 --> 00:00:38.166
Don't miss it when you pass by. Take a look.

18
00:00:38.166 --> 00:00:39.300
Hey come on come on

19
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.466
Boss, I have seen this shrimp.

20
00:00:41.466 --> 00:00:44.033
But your shrimp is a bit scary

21
00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:46.100
It hurts when you look at it.

22
00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.566
Swallowing it won't break your intestines, right?

23
00:00:48.733 --> 00:00:50.400
Here's a good one.

24
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:51.500
You try it first

25
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:52.266
Forget it. Forget it.

26
00:00:52.266 --> 00:00:53.700
I don't want to wear intestinal poison

27
00:00:53.966 --> 00:00:55.400
Everyone, let's go

28
00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:56.833
Beware of eating dead people

29
00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.700
Hey, it's scattered, it's scattered, it's scattered.

30
00:00:59.066 --> 00:01:00.200
If you don't buy it, don't buy it.

31
00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:01.200
Why are you ruining my business?

32
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.933
I see you as a charlatan

33
00:01:02.933 --> 00:01:04.933
Taking this scourge out to cheat money

34
00:01:04.933 --> 00:01:06.600
What's all this noise?

35
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.400
Such a big county can't accommodate you

36
00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:10.666
Sir, you are just in time

37
00:01:10.666 --> 00:01:11.600
He sells poison

38
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.433
What kind of crayfish?

39
00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.400
I've seen this before.

40
00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:16.966
The youngest son of Wang Yuanwai's family

41
00:01:16.966 --> 00:01:18.500
When playing in the water

42
00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.133
It's the big pliers of this thing

43
00:01:20.133 --> 00:01:21.766
It's a big hole

44
00:01:21.766 --> 00:01:24.600
This thing is flooding right now.

45
00:01:25.166 --> 00:01:26.266
Is a scourge

46
00:01:26.466 --> 00:01:28.500
Please confiscate his stall quickly

47
00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:29.566
Get him out of Ping County

48
00:01:29.566 --> 00:01:30.566
Ask why

49
00:01:30.566 --> 00:01:32.666
I can cook spicy crayfish

50
00:01:32.666 --> 00:01:34.433
And it also solved our Ping County problem.

51
00:01:34.566 --> 00:01:36.333
The Crayfish Infestation Problem

52
00:01:36.333 --> 00:01:37.400
Am I innocent?

53
00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:38.366
Bold people

54
00:01:38.366 --> 00:01:39.333
Nonsense

55
00:01:39.333 --> 00:01:40.533
Come with me, Killers

56
00:01:40.533 --> 00:01:42.500
Yes, let him go.

57
00:01:42.766 --> 00:01:44.266
There are also deceptive poison stalls

58
00:01:44.266 --> 00:01:45.466
We smashed him

59
00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.500
Smashed, smashed, smashed, not smashed, smashed, smashed

60
00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.100
Hurry up and stop

61
00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:51.366
Chef Ge is here

62
00:01:51.366 --> 00:01:53.266
He has a long reputation in the cooking room

63
00:01:53.266 --> 00:01:54.666
He must know the crayfish

64
00:01:54.666 --> 00:01:55.933
How harmful is it?

65
00:01:55.933 --> 00:01:57.800
Chef Ge, you came just in time

66
00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.900
I've now caught this charlatan again

67
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.600
You just happen to be a witness for me.

68
00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.166
This pot he cooked

69
00:02:03.666 --> 00:02:04.933
Is it poisonous?

70
00:02:04.933 --> 00:02:07.400
What this liar does must be poisonous

71
00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.000
I see your whole body is poisonous

72
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.700
This is the top of the food competition

73
00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.900
Chef Lin, what is he?
