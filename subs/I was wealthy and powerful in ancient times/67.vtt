00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.600
What's wrong with you?

2
00:00:02.666 --> 00:00:04.700
Tell him to get out and shut up

3
00:00:04.766 --> 00:00:07.400
If you don't get out, blame me for being rude to you

4
00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:10.100
Ok you wait for me

5
00:00:11.333 --> 00:00:12.133
Humph

6
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:17.600
President, look at me being beaten

7
00:00:17.733 --> 00:00:18.700
Who did it?

8
00:00:19.166 --> 00:00:20.500
He, he, he's crazy.

9
00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:23.466
He actually let the practice not provide us with milk tea ingredients

10
00:00:23.666 --> 00:00:25.066
We were tricked by him

11
00:00:26.333 --> 00:00:27.300
What!

12
00:00:29.866 --> 00:00:31.166
Damn Lin Yi

13
00:00:31.366 --> 00:00:32.900
Fucking fool me again

14
00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.833
Let's go find them

15
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:36.866
Surnamed Lin

16
00:00:36.866 --> 00:00:39.300
You must give me a reasonable explanation today

17
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.366
Yo, this is not Chairperson Li

18
00:00:41.766 --> 00:00:43.566
What are you doing in this life?

19
00:00:43.566 --> 00:00:44.766
I consider you a friend

20
00:00:44.766 --> 00:00:46.366
You take me for an idiot

21
00:00:46.366 --> 00:00:48.933
Why did the workshop stop supplying milk tea ingredients?

22
00:00:48.933 --> 00:00:50.333
And he hurt my people

23
00:00:50.333 --> 00:00:52.366
Well, how is that possible?

24
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:53.733
I never said that.

25
00:00:53.733 --> 00:00:56.166
The manager of the workshop said it himself

26
00:00:56.466 --> 00:00:58.500
Impossible in the middle

27
00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:59.733
There must be some misunderstanding

28
00:00:59.733 --> 00:01:01.100
President Li, don't worry

29
00:01:01.166 --> 00:01:01.866
And me?

30
00:01:01.866 --> 00:01:04.800
I will definitely give you a reasonable explanation in person.

31
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.166
I'll check it out myself

32
00:01:06.166 --> 00:01:08.000
I'm sure you didn't do it.

33
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.200
It's absolutely true.

34
00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.866
Ok, I'll trust you again.

35
00:01:10.866 --> 00:01:12.400
Stop messing around

36
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.766
Ah hum

37
00:01:18.333 --> 00:01:19.233
Shopkeeper Lin

38
00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.066
What kind of medicine do you sell in this gourd?

39
00:01:23.366 --> 00:01:24.666
Steady Li Rongfan first

40
00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.600
When the time comes, wait for him to react

41
00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.566
The gods can't save him
