00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:01.566
Freshly baked milk tea

2
00:00:01.566 --> 00:00:02.600
Come and try it!

3
00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:05.166
Bifson, didn't your store go out?

4
00:00:05.166 --> 00:00:06.600
Why did it become a butcher's restaurant again?

5
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:07.500
I got it back.

6
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.300
Come and try the freshly baked milk tea

7
00:00:11.733 --> 00:00:13.266
But what kind of broken milk tea are you?

8
00:00:13.266 --> 00:00:14.666
It tastes different. Hmm.

9
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.066
That's impossible.

10
00:00:16.066 --> 00:00:17.100
I just tasted it.

11
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.666
It's good, what can be done?

12
00:00:18.666 --> 00:00:20.100
It doesn't taste right at all

13
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.700
Where did the boss go?

14
00:00:21.866 --> 00:00:24.700
He, he, come and take a look, take a look?

15
00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:25.366
Good news

16
00:00:25.366 --> 00:00:27.266
What about Lin's Restaurant? It reopened.

17
00:00:27.266 --> 00:00:28.333
The address is at the end of the street.

18
00:00:28.333 --> 00:00:30.466
Welcome to taste this thirteen incense

19
00:00:30.466 --> 00:00:31.733
Crayfish and milk tea?

20
00:00:31.733 --> 00:00:32.666
Buy one get one free

21
00:00:32.666 --> 00:00:33.366
bundle sale

22
00:00:33.366 --> 00:00:34.366
Everybody, go check it out!

23
00:00:34.366 --> 00:00:35.700
It was moved to the end of the street

24
00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.300
I'm just craving a mouthful of thirteen spices with milk tea

25
00:00:38.366 --> 00:00:39.933
Milk tea made from the attached restaurant

26
00:00:39.933 --> 00:00:42.666
What kind of crap? Just walk around at the end of the street, he said.

27
00:00:43.533 --> 00:00:46.300
Lin Yi, what are you trying to do?

28
00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.166
Come to my restaurant and steal my business

29
00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:49.333
I don't have it.

30
00:00:49.333 --> 00:00:50.533
They volunteered

31
00:00:50.533 --> 00:00:52.266
Your milk tea is so bad

32
00:00:52.466 --> 00:00:52.866
Say

33
00:00:52.866 --> 00:00:55.333
What law says you can't have guests?

34
00:00:55.333 --> 00:00:57.366
Believe it or not, I will kill you.

35
00:00:57.366 --> 00:00:59.900
Boss Bi, how can you deal with me instead of thinking about this?

36
00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:01.000
Why don't you think about it first

37
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.400
My own business in Tongfu Restaurant

38
00:01:03.566 --> 00:01:05.366
I believe it won't be long

39
00:01:05.366 --> 00:01:07.866
Your restaurant is going bankrupt

40
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.966
Threatening me, I have been running a restaurant in Bifu City for more than ten years

41
00:01:10.966 --> 00:01:12.433
Isn't it open in vain?

42
00:01:12.533 --> 00:01:15.166
These ten miles and eight townships are my regular customers.

43
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.800
What are you?

44
00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.666
You deserve to fight with me

45
00:01:18.666 --> 00:01:20.766
I advise you to buy a good coffin

46
00:01:20.766 --> 00:01:21.700
Do you understand?

47
00:01:23.566 --> 00:01:25.266
This kid is too rampant

48
00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.633
Don't blame me for beating him
