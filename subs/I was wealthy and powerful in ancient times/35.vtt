00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.066
Lord, give me a chance

2
00:00:02.066 --> 00:00:03.933
Lord, please forgive me

3
00:00:03.933 --> 00:00:05.966
You can ask me to do anything

4
00:00:05.966 --> 00:00:07.866
Lord Lin Yi

5
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.333
How do you want to deal with this person?

6
00:00:10.333 --> 00:00:11.300
I don't think so.

7
00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:13.533
It is good to deal with it according to the law

8
00:00:13.533 --> 00:00:15.566
Take the two of them back to the yamen for me

9
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.200
This officer will judge in person

10
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:19.100
Please forgive me.

11
00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:21.566
Adults don't dare anymore

12
00:00:22.333 --> 00:00:24.066
Thank you for your help today

13
00:00:24.066 --> 00:00:27.500
It doesn't matter, I may still advocate you in the future

14
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:28.400
Ha ha.

15
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.166
You are now in the eyes of prosperity

16
00:00:31.166 --> 00:00:34.000
I have to say goodbye in advance

17
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.266
Adults walk slowly

18
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.466
Lady is so nice

19
00:00:39.466 --> 00:00:40.333
Let me tell you something.

20
00:00:40.333 --> 00:00:41.700
With the support of the emperor?

21
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.866
Our family will definitely develop in the future

22
00:00:43.866 --> 00:00:45.633
Really? Of course.

23
00:00:45.733 --> 00:00:47.966
With the emperor's gold medal

24
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.266
And a gold sign

25
00:00:49.266 --> 00:00:50.000
I believe it.

26
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.633
The restaurant you open will definitely be full of people

27
00:00:57.766 --> 00:00:59.700
Yo shopkeeper

28
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:02.166
Why are you looking so happy? Let me tell you.

29
00:01:02.166 --> 00:01:03.666
What about the governor of Yizhou?

30
00:01:03.666 --> 00:01:06.666
Dedicated my crayfish to the emperor

31
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.500
And guess what?

32
00:01:11.466 --> 00:01:12.266
that

33
00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:15.966
Avoid death gold plate

34
00:01:16.166 --> 00:01:17.233
How is that possible?

35
00:01:17.333 --> 00:01:19.633
Did you make a fake piece?

36
00:01:20.933 --> 00:01:22.466
This is for antivirus.

37
00:01:22.466 --> 00:01:23.400
This thing

38
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.766
But the self-eating alchemists brought it back in person

39
00:01:25.766 --> 00:01:26.666
So sweet.

40
00:01:27.866 --> 00:01:29.300
That's so amazing.

41
00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:30.700
I have lived for decades

42
00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.200
This is the first time I've seen this death-free gold medal

43
00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.766
There is also a golden sign

44
00:01:34.766 --> 00:01:35.700
On the way

45
00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:36.333
What about this time?

46
00:01:36.333 --> 00:01:38.600
I came back with 1,800 taels of silver

47
00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.366
This vast sea of Kowloon

48
00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:41.366
Inadequate

49
00:01:41.466 --> 00:01:45.000
How about you, just prepare for the celebration banquet
