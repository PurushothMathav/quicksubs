00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:02.433
They have a problem with their crayfish

2
00:00:05.666 --> 00:00:07.600
Lin, you sell poisoned shrimp.

3
00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.200
Your heart is so dark

4
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:10.300
That's impossible.

5
00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:12.300
My crayfish are fresh every day

6
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:13.233
How come?

7
00:00:13.266 --> 00:00:16.500
The adult is the one who sells poisoned shrimp

8
00:00:16.533 --> 00:00:17.733
Why is it not?

9
00:00:17.733 --> 00:00:19.200
Sir, listen to my explanation

10
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.933
The horse hotel opened in the east of the city today

11
00:00:20.933 --> 00:00:22.300
It is said to have eaten a person to death

12
00:00:22.533 --> 00:00:23.666
That's simply not possible.

13
00:00:23.666 --> 00:00:25.766
And I haven't hired anyone lately.

14
00:00:25.766 --> 00:00:27.366
The store was not operated before.

15
00:00:27.466 --> 00:00:28.900
Dare to quibble in the face of facts

16
00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:30.133
Arrest him for me

17
00:00:30.133 --> 00:00:31.466
Yes, go back to the yamen

18
00:00:31.566 --> 00:00:32.933
Hello uncle

19
00:00:32.933 --> 00:00:35.433
Oops oops

20
00:00:36.533 --> 00:00:37.966
Brother Lin

21
00:00:37.966 --> 00:00:39.500
How did you get caught?

22
00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.600
Tomorrow you will open two stores each in Chengdong and Chengnan

23
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.800
His name is Lin's Ma Xiao

24
00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.700
Remember you have to give me a lot of publicity

25
00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:48.633
Hey, Big Joe

26
00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:51.100
Didn't you already give Li one or two hundred taels?

27
00:00:51.166 --> 00:00:52.166
Then you are stupid

28
00:00:52.166 --> 00:00:53.466
How is 200 taels enough?

29
00:00:53.466 --> 00:00:55.866
I'm going to open four more by then

30
00:00:55.866 --> 00:00:57.466
Transfer all to Lin Yi

31
00:00:57.866 --> 00:00:59.500
After he is completely hooked

32
00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.166
I'll let him go bankrupt

33
00:01:02.166 --> 00:01:05.033
At that time, you can only give me Chow Tai Fook.

34
00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.900
When the cow becomes a horse

35
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.033
Hahaha he is awesome

36
00:01:09.533 --> 00:01:11.300
Chow Tai Fook, did you frame me?

37
00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:12.566
Don't talk nonsense

38
00:01:12.566 --> 00:01:14.600
I'm a serious businessperson

39
00:01:15.466 --> 00:01:16.266
Ah!

40
00:01:17.066 --> 00:01:18.633
Ha sensible words

41
00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.200
Hurry up and sign the body seller for me

42
00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.333
Hand over the crayfish recipe

43
00:01:23.333 --> 00:01:25.133
I can keep you alive

44
00:01:25.133 --> 00:01:27.233
Bah, don't even think about it.

45
00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.266
You made me do that.

46
00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:34.366
The adult prisoner has been brought to you

47
00:01:34.366 --> 00:01:35.500
You are guilty

48
00:01:35.566 --> 00:01:36.633
What am I guilty of?

49
00:01:36.766 --> 00:01:39.966
The crayfish you sold killed people

50
00:01:40.266 --> 00:01:41.933
Isn't that a sin?

51
00:01:41.933 --> 00:01:43.933
The store in the east of the city is not mine at all

52
00:01:43.933 --> 00:01:44.366
and

53
00:01:44.366 --> 00:01:46.166
I didn't know they had crayfish in them.

54
00:01:46.166 --> 00:01:48.200
Oh my lord he is lying

55
00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.633
The villain and he are partners

56
00:01:50.733 --> 00:01:53.533
This guy told me to make it from fresh lobster

57
00:01:53.533 --> 00:01:56.966
Ma Xiao will charge it with a pile of stinky fish and rotten shrimp.

58
00:01:56.966 --> 00:02:00.666
When the villain arrived, he was already dead
