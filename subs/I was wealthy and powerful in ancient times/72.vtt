00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:01.966
Boss Fan, what about Li Rongfa?

2
00:00:01.966 --> 00:00:03.300
From Huaishui to back

3
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.000
No one has been willing to pick up the goods for him yet.

4
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.400
He is so pitiful!

5
00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.600
That's amorous and unjust.

6
00:00:08.666 --> 00:00:10.400
He asked for it.

7
00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:16.100
President Li, what about your motorcade?

8
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.333
Ahahaha

9
00:00:18.333 --> 00:00:21.733
A convoy? You can't even find a convoy. Come on

10
00:00:21.733 --> 00:00:22.400
Ah no

11
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.866
The wagons we got in line couldn't keep going

12
00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:26.566
If you can't pick up the goods

13
00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.166
You have to die

14
00:00:29.066 --> 00:00:30.266
I know all this

15
00:00:30.366 --> 00:00:31.300
I know it all

16
00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.166
Boss Huang, can you be more accommodating?

17
00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:34.133
Give me some time.

18
00:00:34.133 --> 00:00:36.233
I was transferred from Huaibei Road

19
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.400
No need for President Li

20
00:00:37.566 --> 00:00:39.300
I think I need to revisit

21
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.966
Your strength in Gangnam Road

22
00:00:41.766 --> 00:00:43.933
Farewell to Boss Pang

23
00:00:43.933 --> 00:00:45.266
Wait, boss Pang

24
00:00:47.266 --> 00:00:50.266
The divorce again is your fault

25
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.500
Now don't blame me

26
00:01:03.366 --> 00:01:04.700
Linyi, Linyi

27
00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.833
They all say that being a person stays on the line

28
00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:12.700
See you later

29
00:01:13.466 --> 00:01:14.766
But you

30
00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.966
It really fascinated me

31
00:01:19.466 --> 00:01:22.266
Then don't blame me
