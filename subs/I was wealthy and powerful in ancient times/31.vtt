00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:01.466
Days now.

2
00:00:01.466 --> 00:00:04.300
Why are they still selling crayfish on the 9th floor?

3
00:00:04.966 --> 00:00:05.666
That's impossible.

4
00:00:05.666 --> 00:00:08.566
I have sent people to keep an eye on the prime minister during this time

5
00:00:08.566 --> 00:00:09.866
Chili merchants and pepper merchants

6
00:00:09.866 --> 00:00:11.233
Didn't deliver to him

7
00:00:11.533 --> 00:00:12.666
Lin Yin this brat

8
00:00:12.666 --> 00:00:14.700
Shouldn't there be a new way?

9
00:00:15.133 --> 00:00:17.166
Madam, you can investigate again.

10
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:18.500
It's the truth.

11
00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:20.366
Leave the phone bill

12
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:22.566
Again, yeah.

13
00:00:34.166 --> 00:00:35.900
Is something bad going on?

14
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.800
What? He nailed it?

15
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.600
Pepper traders and prickly ash traders through other channels

16
00:00:39.733 --> 00:00:41.100
No no

17
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.266
I just went to their restaurant

18
00:00:42.266 --> 00:00:43.533
Tasted their crayfish

19
00:00:43.533 --> 00:00:45.366
It's not spicy at all.

20
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.000
What is that 1314?

21
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.900
Oh no, fifteen spices are coming.

22
00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.366
Yummy really delicious

23
00:00:52.366 --> 00:00:54.233
More ecstatic than spicy ones

24
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.866
There are also new flavors launched.

25
00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:57.566
When did this happen?

26
00:00:57.966 --> 00:01:00.500
Damn one more news

27
00:01:00.966 --> 00:01:02.866
Our restaurant near Yizhou

28
00:01:02.866 --> 00:01:04.633
They have a crayfish restaurant

29
00:01:04.733 --> 00:01:07.166
Also launched crayfish free

30
00:01:07.166 --> 00:01:08.566
20% off the rest of the consumption

31
00:01:08.566 --> 00:01:10.766
So many things happened behind the scenes

32
00:01:11.133 --> 00:01:14.200
You've always been a brat, you're really a thief

33
00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:15.400
Don't panic

34
00:01:16.133 --> 00:01:17.766
On this one-third acre of land in Illinois

35
00:01:17.766 --> 00:01:19.233
Even if he is a dragon crossing the river

36
00:01:19.366 --> 00:01:21.300
You have to give me an honest plate

37
00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:22.600
He wants to fight a price war

38
00:01:22.866 --> 00:01:24.033
I will fight with him
