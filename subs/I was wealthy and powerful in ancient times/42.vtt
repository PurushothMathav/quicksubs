00:00:00.666 --> 00:00:03.466
But I've decided that before I do that

2
00:00:03.733 --> 00:00:06.266
You enjoy it first

3
00:00:06.266 --> 00:00:08.700
Make a good impression on you.

4
00:00:09.666 --> 00:00:12.000
Well, even if you are a lot of gourds

5
00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:14.300
No one will come to save your life.

6
00:00:14.866 --> 00:00:16.266
How is it, Boss Lin?

7
00:00:16.266 --> 00:00:18.466
I saw Wang Qianjun go in with my own eyes just now.

8
00:00:18.466 --> 00:00:19.800
When do we go in?

9
00:00:19.866 --> 00:00:20.666
Now.

10
00:00:21.333 --> 00:00:23.633
Hey, help!

11
00:00:24.266 --> 00:00:25.266
Help!

12
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:26.900
Yeah yeah

13
00:00:27.366 --> 00:00:29.400
Wang, according to me, I have given you all the property.

14
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:30.900
Why are you still invading me?

15
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.666
Ah, you've gone too far.

16
00:00:32.666 --> 00:00:36.066
Oh yeah, you actually found Wang according to

17
00:00:36.966 --> 00:00:38.033
Damn li yu

18
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:39.900
How dare you betray me?

19
00:00:39.966 --> 00:00:41.300
out of breath

20
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.166
You've gone too far.

21
00:00:43.166 --> 00:00:45.633
Forestry I have something to tell you

22
00:00:45.866 --> 00:00:47.466
This is an important matter.

23
00:00:47.533 --> 00:00:49.500
What's the matter with your wife?

24
00:00:49.933 --> 00:00:52.900
Very moist hahahahaha

25
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:55.800
Take them both away from me

26
00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:56.800
Take back to the yamen

27
00:00:59.066 --> 00:00:59.600
Sorry.

28
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:00.633
I'm late.

29
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.766
Sir, don't listen to his nonsense

30
00:01:03.766 --> 00:01:05.500
Nothing happened between me and him

31
00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.566
I was about to bite my tongue just now

32
00:01:07.566 --> 00:01:10.033
I thought I would never see you again

33
00:01:11.066 --> 00:01:13.133
Hey, why are you so stupid?

34
00:01:13.133 --> 00:01:15.700
You gave him so much sincerity for me

35
00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.466
Did you work so hard to earn it?

36
00:01:17.466 --> 00:01:18.400
Don't you feel sorry?

37
00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.366
The money is gone, you can make it again.

38
00:01:20.366 --> 00:01:22.766
If people are gone, there is nothing

39
00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:23.866
Money is external

40
00:01:24.333 --> 00:01:25.133
Don't worry.

41
00:01:25.666 --> 00:01:29.366
Husband, I was born to be your person

42
00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.000
Death is your ghost
