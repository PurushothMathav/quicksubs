00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:01.466
Hahaha

2
00:00:03.166 --> 00:00:04.866
Oops, president, you're back

3
00:00:04.866 --> 00:00:06.066
What do you say when you mix over there?

4
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:07.100
Humph

5
00:00:07.866 --> 00:00:09.200
Everything went well.

6
00:00:09.366 --> 00:00:11.966
Lin Yi still wants to cut off my way

7
00:00:12.533 --> 00:00:14.366
Not so easy to walk

8
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:15.966
Find a carriage to pick up the goods

9
00:00:15.966 --> 00:00:18.166
I heard that Li Rong sent it back.

10
00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:19.766
That guy has some patience

11
00:00:19.766 --> 00:00:21.366
It's only been a few days.

12
00:00:21.366 --> 00:00:23.600
The road to Huaishui Road was opened up by him

13
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.300
Hum Lao Wang Lao Chen

14
00:00:26.366 --> 00:00:27.766
There you are!

15
00:00:27.766 --> 00:00:29.866
Your motorcade will come with me

16
00:00:29.866 --> 00:00:32.566
President Li, the three melons and two dates you gave

17
00:00:32.666 --> 00:00:34.066
I don't think so.

18
00:00:34.066 --> 00:00:37.166
Don't worry, I'll pay double the price this time.

19
00:00:37.166 --> 00:00:38.466
Three times we don't go either

20
00:00:39.666 --> 00:00:42.000
I gave you face, right?

21
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.433
You don't go twice as natural, someone hums

22
00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:47.100
I'll see who dares to go

23
00:00:50.466 --> 00:00:53.600
It seems that you two are a team to pit me

24
00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.200
We've been friends for a long time

25
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.566
President Li, we didn't cheat you

26
00:00:57.566 --> 00:01:01.433
But have you deducted a lot of our wages before?

27
00:01:01.533 --> 00:01:03.700
Hmph, still old friendship

28
00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:06.800
I haven't seen you think of our old friendship before

29
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.900
Go away I see

30
00:01:09.266 --> 00:01:12.466
You two are partners with Xinglin, right?

31
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:13.600
So?

32
00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:14.700
Tell the truth

33
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:15.766
The entire Gangnam Road

34
00:01:15.766 --> 00:01:18.733
Now there's no one you can count on

35
00:01:18.733 --> 00:01:21.466
Return the fleet, I think it's okay

36
00:01:21.466 --> 00:01:22.933
I still don't believe it.

37
00:01:22.933 --> 00:01:24.800
Money can make a ghost run the mill

38
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.266
Three times no one goes I pay ten times

39
00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:29.500
I see who dares to move

40
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:30.900
OK

41
00:01:31.533 --> 00:01:34.366
So good when I Li Yunfa turned over

42
00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.866
None of you can escape
