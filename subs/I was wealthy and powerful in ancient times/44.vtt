00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:02.100
I don't have the habit of white horse heads.

2
00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:03.366
If they want to deal with

3
00:00:03.366 --> 00:00:05.266
Just let them deal with it.

4
00:00:05.566 --> 00:00:07.366
Go there first

5
00:00:10.966 --> 00:00:13.533
Hey brother, what really happened?

6
00:00:13.533 --> 00:00:16.633
But don't blame me for not reminding you, haha.

7
00:00:19.166 --> 00:00:20.200
Asako

8
00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:23.000
Is there anything new in Bianzhou City recently?

9
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.666
Lord Hu

10
00:00:23.666 --> 00:00:26.500
We have a new rich boy in Bianzhou City

11
00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.100
It's very generous

12
00:00:28.266 --> 00:00:31.400
I came to the restaurant where Bi Fusheng played

13
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:32.166
Every month.

14
00:00:32.166 --> 00:00:33.400
Give him back 2,000 taels of silver

15
00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.700
Then why hasn't he contacted our people yet?

16
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:36.800
king

17
00:00:36.933 --> 00:00:39.766
When I came to Bianzhou City, I dared not to run a pier

18
00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.500
Didn't Bi Fusheng tell him?

19
00:00:41.766 --> 00:00:44.833
Hu Daren Bi Fusheng is asking to see you outside the door

20
00:00:45.133 --> 00:00:48.066
Say Cao Cao, Cao Cao will come in

21
00:00:48.666 --> 00:00:49.366
Oh my lord

22
00:00:49.366 --> 00:00:52.300
Grass people and floating life greet adults, hahaha

23
00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:54.466
Boss Bi, please get up

24
00:00:54.466 --> 00:00:55.766
Hahahaha

25
00:00:55.766 --> 00:00:56.866
Bifson

26
00:00:57.066 --> 00:00:59.366
What's the matter with you coming to the door in the middle of the night?

27
00:00:59.366 --> 00:01:00.966
I heard that

28
00:01:00.966 --> 00:01:03.900
It seems that a noble son has taken over your restaurant.

29
00:01:03.933 --> 00:01:06.133
It's the adults who are so well-informed

30
00:01:06.133 --> 00:01:08.400
Well, then why didn't he come to the pier?

31
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.666
Didn't you tell him?

32
00:01:09.666 --> 00:01:10.766
Wronged, my lord

33
00:01:10.766 --> 00:01:12.733
The grass-roots people came for this

34
00:01:12.733 --> 00:01:14.700
Caomin told him to go to the pier

35
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.666
But he said he didn't have the habit

36
00:01:17.266 --> 00:01:20.766
I want adults to be brave enough to deal with him

37
00:01:20.766 --> 00:01:23.966
How dare a small businessperson be so arrogant

38
00:01:23.966 --> 00:01:27.500
You can go there tomorrow and catch him for me.

39
00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.766
My lord wants to interrogate him himself, is that hey?
