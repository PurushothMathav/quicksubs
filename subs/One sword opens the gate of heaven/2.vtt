00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:03.066
Xiaofeng, welcome back from Beijing

2
00:00:03.166 --> 00:00:05.700
I heard that you have now become a saint

3
00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.600
Hui married one of the four great Qi kings

4
00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.366
So young and promising

5
00:00:09.366 --> 00:00:11.766
Yang Feng, are you coming back this time?

6
00:00:11.766 --> 00:00:14.266
Hurry up and get married to Ruyun

7
00:00:14.266 --> 00:00:17.900
We Chen Li two marriage Eastern Zhou and Northern Zhou joined forces

8
00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:19.566
Unique in the world.

9
00:00:19.566 --> 00:00:21.500
That's what I mean.

10
00:00:21.533 --> 00:00:22.533
But I just got back.

11
00:00:22.533 --> 00:00:24.800
I heard that the smiling Buddha dared to order

12
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.800
Let the goddess of the nine clans control one person

13
00:00:28.066 --> 00:00:29.600
It doesn't make any sense.

14
00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:32.066
But the smiling Buddha, I respect him with some face

15
00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:34.000
He took himself seriously.

16
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.333
Now the power of my wine feet is not weaker than that of Tianlong Hall

17
00:00:37.333 --> 00:00:39.133
Besides, besides

18
00:00:39.133 --> 00:00:42.066
Our nine heavenly daughters are Kyushu Muses

19
00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.166
Why marry him alone?

20
00:00:44.166 --> 00:00:46.966
The goddess of the nine clans comes to protect the Kyushu Continent

21
00:00:46.966 --> 00:00:49.766
How can you marry a mere mortal?

22
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.900
Don't worry.

23
00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:52.266
As long as he dares to come

24
00:00:52.266 --> 00:00:55.066
I will call him back

25
00:00:56.866 --> 00:00:58.500
What a big breath

26
00:01:02.333 --> 00:01:03.500
Who are you?

27
00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.466
I am what you call a mere mortal

28
00:01:07.533 --> 00:01:08.600
Is that you?

29
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.600
Delusional desire to marry the goddess of the nine clans

30
00:01:10.866 --> 00:01:13.866
I thought the Laughing Buddha had found someone

31
00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:15.366
So it's you?

32
00:01:15.366 --> 00:01:17.866
Still delusional to marry my Dongzhou Tiannu

33
00:01:17.866 --> 00:01:19.100
What right do you have?

34
00:01:19.266 --> 00:01:20.066
back then

35
00:01:20.666 --> 00:01:22.666
This golden book

36
00:01:22.666 --> 00:01:24.233
What contract is there?

37
00:01:24.333 --> 00:01:26.300
You are the beloved in the mouth of the fairy aunt

38
00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.200
What kind of good man?

39
00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.200
Dad, what are you talking about?

40
00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:31.600
When the fairy aunt came to earth

41
00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:32.400
Bless our clan

42
00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.833
The two parties had a wedding ceremony

43
00:01:34.566 --> 00:01:35.666
The beloved does not come out

44
00:01:35.733 --> 00:01:36.700
Keep yourself like a jade

45
00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:37.666
If violated

46
00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:39.266
Must be condemned

47
00:01:39.766 --> 00:01:43.266
Uncle, what era is this?

48
00:01:43.266 --> 00:01:44.266
What fairy aunt

49
00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.366
This is nonsense.

50
00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:47.900
That's right dad

51
00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:49.766
My childhood sweetheart Yang Feng and I

52
00:01:49.766 --> 00:01:50.966
like-minded

53
00:01:51.166 --> 00:01:54.100
Besides, he is King Qi under the command of the Holy Maiden

54
00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:56.600
I am the daughter of the Eastern Zhou Dynasty again

55
00:01:56.666 --> 00:01:59.300
If you want to marry, you can only marry King Qi

56
00:01:59.466 --> 00:02:01.866
As for him, the trash

57
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.300
I don't deserve the first one. I don't deserve it.

58
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.433
When you lent me an amazing fish leap dragon gate

59
00:02:08.466 --> 00:02:10.100
Become the son of Zhengzhou

60
00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:12.766
Now I'm just here to take back what belongs to me

61
00:02:13.166 --> 00:02:15.400
You want to break the contract

62
00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.666
Aren't you afraid of being punished by God?
