00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:02.133
Tianfuru

2
00:00:02.133 --> 00:00:03.300
I am God

3
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.866
Can you stand my anger?

4
00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:08.933
On the contrary, I don't think you can make it up.

5
00:00:08.933 --> 00:00:10.566
I really think of myself as a god

6
00:00:10.566 --> 00:00:12.466
The dog is about to jump off the wall in a hurry

7
00:00:12.466 --> 00:00:14.233
I almost believed it just now

8
00:00:14.866 --> 00:00:16.466
If not the true patron saint

9
00:00:16.466 --> 00:00:17.200
Can't I wait?

10
00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.133
Hmph, our nine clans

11
00:00:19.133 --> 00:00:22.766
Can it be shaken by a small man?

12
00:00:22.966 --> 00:00:25.666
Quickly kneel down and kowtow to the Martial Saint

13
00:00:25.666 --> 00:00:27.233
Please forgive me

14
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.866
A bunch of ignorant people

15
00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:31.633
cocoon

16
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.233
self-destruct

17
00:00:34.133 --> 00:00:38.200
Ask God to record that he also violated the way of heaven by changing his life against the sky

18
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.700
Tiannu is inevitable

19
00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:44.466
Bai Ling is at this time, and you still believe him

20
00:00:48.166 --> 00:00:49.100
Heaven's wrath will know

21
00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.000
Just a flash of lightning

22
00:00:51.166 --> 00:00:52.300
It's the wrath of heaven

23
00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:53.266
If it is wrath

24
00:00:53.266 --> 00:00:55.800
Just come at me for three minutes

25
00:00:56.166 --> 00:00:57.400
The wrath of heaven is coming

26
00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:02.200
Why does God get angry in 3 minutes? That's right

27
00:01:02.366 --> 00:01:04.166
It will be like thunder

28
00:01:04.466 --> 00:01:06.800
All those who go against the sky

29
00:01:07.166 --> 00:01:08.833
Will be judged

30
00:01:08.866 --> 00:01:12.100
God thunder hahahahaha ridiculous

31
00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.466
Self-deception to this extent

32
00:01:14.466 --> 00:01:15.833
If it is wrath

33
00:01:15.866 --> 00:01:18.233
Come at me for two minutes

34
00:01:18.333 --> 00:01:20.266
Kneel down and beg for mercy now

35
00:01:20.333 --> 00:01:22.633
Let your people beg for heaven

36
00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:24.933
Maybe escape death

37
00:01:24.933 --> 00:01:25.866
Even if there is thunder

38
00:01:25.866 --> 00:01:27.500
You were the first to die

39
00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.633
Come in a minute.

40
00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.966
I'm waiting to follow this.

41
00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:35.200
Uh-huh.

42
00:01:38.933 --> 00:01:39.800
Ah!
