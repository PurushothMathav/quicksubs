00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:01.433
Unaware of life and death

2
00:00:01.533 --> 00:00:02.500
Please be careful

3
00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:03.666
He has charm

4
00:00:03.666 --> 00:00:04.800
Can limit divine power

5
00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:07.366
Shen Yun, right? I have it too

6
00:00:08.933 --> 00:00:12.866
Ahhhh!

7
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.833
I feel so crushed.

8
00:00:16.066 --> 00:00:17.166
Such a powerful majesty

9
00:00:18.333 --> 00:00:19.433
Deceive others

10
00:00:19.666 --> 00:00:22.466
I can't breathe.

11
00:00:22.666 --> 00:00:24.766
I'm dying.

12
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.900
I seem to

13
00:00:39.466 --> 00:00:41.000
I seem to be doing it again

14
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:46.266
Was it a terrible encounter just now? Go to hell

15
00:00:49.066 --> 00:00:50.766
Behind you

16
00:00:53.133 --> 00:00:55.266
You are too slow, how is that possible?

17
00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.433
How can he still be so fast in my realm?

18
00:00:58.533 --> 00:01:01.500
Impossible how can you be stronger than your master

19
00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.100
When did I say my disciple was not as good as me?

20
00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.566
Will your hell not fail?

21
00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.566
Watch me open

22
00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:11.300
Ah!

23
00:01:14.066 --> 00:01:16.200
So heavy pressure

24
00:01:20.933 --> 00:01:24.100
How could he be better than the new army?

25
00:01:24.133 --> 00:01:25.700
Then aren't we

26
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:32.966
Supreme Prison

27
00:01:33.366 --> 00:01:36.400
Could it be that you have developed a divine body?

28
00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:40.200
That's right, I was already Yuan Zhen Kyushu back then

29
00:01:40.333 --> 00:01:42.300
Now I have become a god

30
00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:43.666
Just retrieve the essence

31
00:01:43.666 --> 00:01:47.166
I can rise to become a true immortal

32
00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:49.600
kneel

33
00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.833
Ah no

34
00:01:56.933 --> 00:01:57.866
Lord Shen Ping

35
00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:59.100
As long as you spare my life

36
00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.666
I'll do whatever you want me to do

37
00:02:00.666 --> 00:02:02.400
You still want to use this trick

38
00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.433
Do you think I'm a fool?

39
00:02:04.866 --> 00:02:06.766
Yang Fan, you can't trust him

40
00:02:07.666 --> 00:02:09.866
Don't worry, hey
