00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:01.866
What should the ancestors do?

2
00:00:01.866 --> 00:00:03.833
Burn no no

3
00:00:03.866 --> 00:00:04.966
You can't kill me!

4
00:00:04.966 --> 00:00:06.000
I am the King of Yan

5
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.033
If you kill me, you will be the enemy of Ben Yan

6
00:00:08.066 --> 00:00:08.866
how

7
00:00:09.366 --> 00:00:11.700
Am I afraid that you will fail?

8
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:12.733
As long as you don't kill me

9
00:00:12.733 --> 00:00:15.366
I, Beiyan, am willing to withdraw and leave to befriend Dazhou

10
00:00:15.366 --> 00:00:18.966
Who said just now that they wanted to let me

11
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.500
Land surrender compensation?

12
00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.500
No, I, Beiyan, am willing to cede the land and pay compensation

13
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:23.466
As long as you don't kill me

14
00:00:23.466 --> 00:00:24.933
You can ask me to do anything

15
00:00:24.933 --> 00:00:26.366
Kneel down for me

16
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.633
Can't kneel King Yan

17
00:00:28.733 --> 00:00:30.600
I kneel

18
00:00:33.266 --> 00:00:35.866
Beiyin is willing to submit to Kyushu

19
00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.566
I led thousands of troops on expeditions for many years

20
00:00:38.566 --> 00:00:42.033
Beiyin won it effortlessly

21
00:00:43.166 --> 00:00:45.466
Death or surrender

22
00:00:45.866 --> 00:00:46.666
Dongyi

23
00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.766
Willing to submit to me, Nanqi willing to submit to Kyushu

24
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.333
Am I not dreaming?

25
00:00:53.333 --> 00:00:55.066
Since the three weeks have surrendered

26
00:00:55.666 --> 00:00:59.400
Holy Maiden, my Kyushu continent is finally complete
