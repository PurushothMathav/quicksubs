00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:02.966
The lion didn't burn him no matter how nimble he was

2
00:00:02.966 --> 00:00:04.000
That's not possible.

3
00:00:04.366 --> 00:00:05.500
The old man's flexibility

4
00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:08.033
After killing you for so long, you're okay

5
00:00:08.133 --> 00:00:09.633
What flexibility?

6
00:00:09.733 --> 00:00:13.300
Isn't it just an ordinary flame mixed with a little aura?

7
00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:15.800
Yang Fan, it's great that you're alright

8
00:00:16.733 --> 00:00:17.866
He is a fairy

9
00:00:17.866 --> 00:00:20.166
You must have some magic weapon on you

10
00:00:20.166 --> 00:00:21.766
Talent is flexible for the old man

11
00:00:21.766 --> 00:00:23.266
Yeah, it must be.

12
00:00:23.266 --> 00:00:24.866
You're pretty good at making up for it

13
00:00:24.866 --> 00:00:27.400
Master, kill him quickly

14
00:00:27.466 --> 00:00:29.066
I don't believe it

15
00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.200
I just used the power of a city just now

16
00:00:31.333 --> 00:00:33.300
I want you to die now

17
00:00:35.133 --> 00:00:37.100
This time he must die

18
00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:38.700
That's all you got.

19
00:00:42.566 --> 00:00:43.466
That's not possible.

20
00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.466
How can you possibly control my flexibility?

21
00:00:46.766 --> 00:00:48.500
I can not only control

22
00:00:48.733 --> 00:00:50.200
And let him go

23
00:00:50.466 --> 00:00:52.766
Go ah ah ah

24
00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:59.200
And you miss the nine girls.
