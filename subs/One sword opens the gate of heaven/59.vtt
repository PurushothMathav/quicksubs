00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.466
Sure enough, he is an immortal

2
00:00:01.533 --> 00:00:04.033
A thousand arrows are infinite in the wave of your hand

3
00:00:04.066 --> 00:00:06.333
That really opened our eyes.

4
00:00:06.333 --> 00:00:08.900
Otherwise, let's turn it upside down

5
00:00:09.133 --> 00:00:10.666
A hundred arrows pierce the heart

6
00:00:10.666 --> 00:00:14.233
I see that your witch is not dead yet.

7
00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:24.466
Well, it's okay, it's not the other way around

8
00:00:24.566 --> 00:00:26.500
How is this possible?

9
00:00:26.566 --> 00:00:29.233
This immortal technique was so easily cracked by him

10
00:00:29.333 --> 00:00:32.500
Can he contend with the three immortals?

11
00:00:32.766 --> 00:00:34.500
This female skill is unfathomable

12
00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.566
Why don't the three of us join forces and do him?

13
00:00:37.566 --> 00:00:38.433
how

14
00:00:39.066 --> 00:00:41.133
You want to bully less with more

15
00:00:41.133 --> 00:00:44.300
Why should a witch like you talk to you about benevolence, justice and morality?

16
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.833
Go to hell

17
00:00:47.333 --> 00:00:48.900
Why should Sansheng die?

18
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.066
No matter how evil

19
00:00:50.066 --> 00:00:52.400
No matter how powerful it is, it will surely die

20
00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.200
How do we go this time? Wait a minute.

21
00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.000
If he can't, we'll run away

22
00:01:00.266 --> 00:01:02.266
If he doesn't die, we die

23
00:01:02.266 --> 00:01:03.266
Apologize bless
