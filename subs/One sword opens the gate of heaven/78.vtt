00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:01.400
Taoism

2
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.566
Where is the Battle of the God's Stone?

3
00:00:06.133 --> 00:00:07.966
God and Buddha killed him

4
00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.900
They just stood there.

5
00:00:14.933 --> 00:00:17.400
That's right, now the divine stone of these two people

6
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.100
Has arrived in another space

7
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.400
As the so-called Upper Nine Heavens and Nine Realms

8
00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:24.466
The ancestor has the upper hand

9
00:00:24.466 --> 00:00:26.100
Where do you see that he has the upper hand?

10
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:27.666
Obviously the expression is hideous

11
00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.566
How is the Lord?

12
00:00:31.566 --> 00:00:33.666
They have fought tens of thousands of rounds

13
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.266
I didn't expect this wild-eating old ghost to really have two strokes

14
00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.100
Could it be that even the fairy aunt is not as good as him?

15
00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:41.133
This is bad.

16
00:00:41.133 --> 00:00:42.600
If the fairy girl loses

17
00:00:42.666 --> 00:00:43.733
What should we do?

18
00:00:43.733 --> 00:00:48.133
Haha, the new army of Chiyan has been worshipped by me for thousands of years

19
00:00:48.133 --> 00:00:51.366
He is the top immortal in my week.

20
00:00:52.333 --> 00:00:55.566
Yang Fan just gave you the steps, you don't go down

21
00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.900
Regret it now

22
00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:01.766
Do you believe I'll kill you right now?

23
00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:03.500
bag

24
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:04.566
The new army is wounded

25
00:01:04.566 --> 00:01:05.500
How come?

26
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.533
Didn't you have the upper hand just now?

27
00:01:07.533 --> 00:01:09.800
New army, you must not lose

28
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.333
If you lose, we're all doomed

29
00:01:12.333 --> 00:01:14.766
Great, as expected of the ancestor's master

30
00:01:14.766 --> 00:01:16.166
This fairy sister

31
00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:17.600
Gotta win!

32
00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.800
It's okay, Master was just ambushed

33
00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.366
I believe that Master is sad
