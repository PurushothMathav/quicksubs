00:00:02.566 --> 00:00:03.966
Not good is the enemy's revenge

2
00:00:03.966 --> 00:00:05.766
How did they get to the continent?

3
00:00:05.766 --> 00:00:08.000
Murong Chen Xiao Yuzhou

4
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.800
Tuobahong, you are so brave

5
00:00:10.933 --> 00:00:12.400
Dare to break into my continent

6
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.033
It must be the curse that caused the chaos in Kyushu

7
00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:16.733
Let them take advantage of the situation

8
00:00:16.733 --> 00:00:17.566
Exactly.

9
00:00:17.566 --> 00:00:20.000
I didn't expect your big week to be suddenly cursed

10
00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:21.666
This is God helping me wait

11
00:00:21.666 --> 00:00:22.500
Otherwise

12
00:00:22.566 --> 00:00:24.866
How could we have seen such a wonderful scene?

13
00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:28.100
Zhou Tianyu, you really opened my eyes.

14
00:00:28.133 --> 00:00:29.600
You are the emperor of the big week

15
00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.166
Kneeling down to Mystery

16
00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.666
Shame on the emperor

17
00:00:34.066 --> 00:00:35.300
It's a joke.

18
00:00:35.566 --> 00:00:37.400
Your fault. My fault.

19
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:38.966
I shouldn't have left the border

20
00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:40.200
Let them take advantage of the situation

21
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.566
It's not your fault

22
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.466
Since it's here, let's pack it up together

23
00:00:44.466 --> 00:00:46.933
Add territory to the new kingdom

24
00:00:46.933 --> 00:00:49.266
What a big breath you are!

25
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.000
My Nanman million elite soldiers have arrived in Kyushu

26
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:52.800
What do you charge?

27
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.000
Beijin No.3 Middle School

28
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.900
It is also the world of my Beiyan army

29
00:00:57.966 --> 00:00:59.666
No, the Son of Heaven fell to Kyushu

30
00:00:59.666 --> 00:01:01.200
The continents predate the invasion

31
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.666
Can't take it anymore?

32
00:01:02.666 --> 00:01:05.800
What? No miscreants?

33
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:08.900
One country is hatred

34
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:10.600
Ah!

35
00:01:11.733 --> 00:01:15.366
The sky is going to die, my big curse, come on

36
00:01:15.933 --> 00:01:17.933
Seal this for me

37
00:01:17.933 --> 00:01:20.700
No one can leave today
