00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:02.670
They all have the funds to do it for me. Otherwise, it really wouldn’t have been done.

2
00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:20.890
OK, I'll do it right away. The funding of the courts is deliberately inflated.

3
00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:23.130
Kill the ancient names and accumulate money slowly.

4
00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.160
I can't even speak louder. I want to try to kill the jewels with a loud voice and turn red.

5
00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:30.080
Our funds are nowhere near enough.

6
00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:32.759
Even worse, they heard,

7
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.100
We need to open up the gap to acquire gold.

8
00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.400
Now be brave and throw the gold.

9
00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.640
Our financial debt is even more unsustainable.

10
00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:43.660
Gold prices fell again and again. It’s not just short selling that will cause the market to plummet.

11
00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:45.580
After so many years, it is still the same.

12
00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.690
There is no way around this situation

13
00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:52.370
We can only punish Mando to death where we stand.

14
00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:54.960
We know how to use Shu Wang Yi’s funds

15
00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.640
Add in your life-saving work skills.

16
00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.520
No book king one funds

17
00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.480
It’s impossible to capture the entire Daxia story

18
00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.560
There are also some that are still solidified

19
00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:06.460
Try the Undocumented Micro-Army Festival

20
00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:10.640
You are now hiding from at least 100% of my stubborn offenders.

21
00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.200
Otherwise, just wait and talk separately.

22
00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.270
If you have a foreign country, don't run away happily.

23
00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.380
Their funds passed by

24
00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.180
How much spicy do you want?

25
00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.070
Otherwise we should give in

26
00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:30.730
We don’t even have companies everywhere.

27
00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:34.600
Do you still want to show your bullshit in front of old foreigners?

28
00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.280
I'll accompany you, you little leek

29
00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:40.260
Don't talk nonsense

30
00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.660
Finally, I am willing to teach you

31
00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:46.260
I thought you were always trying to catch me

32
00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.560
Now I don’t want you

33
00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:55.200
I also want this little sword to kneel down and guide it for me.

34
00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:58.960
I will continue to use it

35
00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:02.240
