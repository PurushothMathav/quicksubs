00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.340
You, a humble person from above,

2
00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:05.020
I understand that. My three equal parts,

3
00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:09.060
You must do the least. You are just dragging the screen in one class.

4
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.960
Being young is nothing compared to people who are covetous of their mothers and princes and lie to you.

5
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.200
Who gave you the courage? I don’t think the greedy prince should be like this.

6
00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:18.870
One cleaning shop for each class,

7
00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.350
There is also a writer who cannot afford to go to school.

8
00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:23.810
A family that is better than meeting each other,

9
00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:28.110
You are worthy of our most greedy mother to gain strength.

10
00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:30.390
An analysis of the dogs that have become famous in the United States and abroad

11
00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.860
Get out of your dog's eyes and be optimistic

12
00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:39.120
After I lost my life for you

13
00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.820
Because my dad’s financial resources will come soon

14
00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:47.100
It turns out that you met each other

15
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.400
Do even children love to brag so much?

16
00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:00.780
He's just a messed up guy.

17
00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:07.340
Are you driving the broken sword car that I want to give you as a gift?

18
00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.920
There is a skinny face and a tight face, only now
