00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.110
It was before, if you didn’t look at the conditions of your home.

2
00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:06.730
A deoiling bottle, a treasure festival,

3
00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:08.990
There is also a stinky mother who stabs others.

4
00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:12.850
Only on your terms can you get me,

5
00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:15.070
That's eight lifetimes of incense burning.

6
00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:17.610
They really came to tell us that we wanted to eat swan meat.

7
00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:22.390
I'm warning you, my sister is going to have an emergency fire party tonight.

8
00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:25.230
There are all rich people with hundreds of billions of dollars.

9
00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:26.990
Are you and my sister beautiful?

10
00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:28.890
He was beaten by another rich man in three minutes

11
00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:32.409
There is no place to cry

12
00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:34.370
Our family has already suffered from your family

13
00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:38.730
What would be possible for in-laws

14
00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:41.450
Let's talk carefully if we have something to say

15
00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.340
What do you have to say to this handsome man?

16
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.840
People want Pan Fu

17
00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:51.540
Quangui’s original ideal

18
00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:54.710
It's worth it to stay out of his way

19
00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.750
i'm married

20
00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:01.440
you got married

21
00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:04.840
When did this happen?

22
00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.150
Just find an extra performer

23
00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:13.070
I really thought I could marry someone

24
00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:15.280
You can't kill yourself either

25
00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.180
Believe it or not, you have three million

26
00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:27.620
Make some trouble in my day

27
00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.160
All of you want to go

28
00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:31.780
The chamber of commerce of the rich and powerful in Panfo

29
00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.580
You don't want to go

30
00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:38.870
I'll show you

31
00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:40.450
I give me cold

32
00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:46.320
Only one hundred billions of preparations are needed to leave.

33
00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.900
I'm afraid it's just someone like you

34
00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.040
You can't even get through the Tianshang Guild's door, right?

35
00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:55.340
you don't want to get married

36
00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:56.960
Let's not get married

37
00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:59.820
That Dabao stuff is all real

38
00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:06.900
tonight

39
00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:08.820
I'll let this group of people

40
00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.180
Let me know some lucky things for you

41
00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.440
Then I will just block the needle a little bit tonight

42
00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:19.540
I would like to take a look

43
00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.300
You're a closed-off single dad

44
00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:23.940
How big a thing can be

45
00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:25.620
fire door gift
