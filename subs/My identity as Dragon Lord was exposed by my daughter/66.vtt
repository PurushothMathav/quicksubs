00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:01.850
Dad, what are you talking about?

2
00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:04.340
How could he be the hotel owner?

3
00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:06.470
How could you play like this?

4
00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:08.870
I just informed you that you will eat the boss again.

5
00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.010
Uncle, do you have any regrets now?

6
00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:15.210
He is a resident tuner from Banchuan,

7
00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:17.230
Can anyone possibly afford those old hotels?

8
00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.630
I have to go to your house

9
00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:26.600
You have many villains

10
00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:39.870
Why don't you want to be full? You are so

11
00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.130
from now on

12
00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:43.670
This hotel experience

13
00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:45.510
I won't be able to save you

14
00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:51.000
You take more care of me

15
00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:52.900
You told me so many things again today

16
00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:04.150
I think this hotel experience is not in the right place.

17
00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:06.020
I spoke to you before

18
00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.300
Then donâ€™t let the reporters

19
00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:14.260
I just won't go to shows with these people

20
00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:19.510
Where are you at the back?

21
00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:23.320
I saved this hotel building back then

22
00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:24.860
Don't ask him

23
00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.040
Is it true that you want me, Tian Yitian, to be the landlord?

24
00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:34.680
What did I buy this for?

25
00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.300
How old is Lequn, which has a market value of 100 billion?

26
00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:40.390
Tian is over

27
00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:48.920
where is this

28
00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.250
Is this true or false?

29
00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:00.480
he died

30
00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:07.020
He scared you group of keys An Ting
