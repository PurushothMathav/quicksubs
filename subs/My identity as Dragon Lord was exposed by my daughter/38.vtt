00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.120
Their prince, I seem to be your king.

2
00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:04.180
Wouldn't it be happier this way?

3
00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:06.560
But the people below were transformed into human beings.

4
00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:08.640
I can only bully Yu Jiang.

5
00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.540
The woman helped me again. Director Lin,

6
00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:15.170
You hurry up and be careful. The next thing happened to me.

7
00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:20.060
Xiyue, donâ€™t worry, in fact, two hundred and fifty dollars will never catch my eye.

8
00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.900
As long as I am here, there is no one to bully.

9
00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:25.170
Director Lin, even if you are not doing it for yourself,

10
00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.970
You should also consider carefully. He is still so young,

11
00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.259
They are princes. I,

12
00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:34.980
Chen Xiyue, Mr. Volunteer.

13
00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:42.430
Who of you dares to touch my family?

14
00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:48.400
I'm messy, messy, messy

15
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.200
He went to Song Dynasty in 2005

16
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.280
You suppress our people around

17
00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.660
He wants me to kneel down and surrender to you

18
00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:10.280
You're not brother enough

19
00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.060
You are really out of your mind

20
00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.340
I thought you were awesome if you could bring clothes with you

21
00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.060
I have two hundred and five clans

22
00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.860
Being left alone will make you immortal here.

23
00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:23.670
You continue to have two hundred and five clans

24
00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.500
I thought it was all a matter of cheating

25
00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:30.800
Don't say you're being sincere

26
00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.820
Just play Li Xiaoxin Xianfeng

27
00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:41.920
You mean the king

28
00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.120
We promised each other to be careful and considerate.
