00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:03.440
Don't move your hands.

2
00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:05.980
Also support her. About your stupid marriage to her,

3
00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:07.860
Your father and I haven't settled the score with you yet.

4
00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:09.820
You dropped all the rubbish information.

5
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.860
Those who compete in junior high schools earn money.

6
00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:13.920
A relative in the family is working hard in the first middle school,

7
00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:18.400
It’s not that it’s inappropriate to pet, it’s just that it won’t fly well.

8
00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:24.710
Aunt Long is right. This loser can only talk about chance encounters.

9
00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.910
The strength of a whole family cannot be punished by such a face. The gains and losses are like those of a liar.

10
00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:32.180
that is. This waste,

11
00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:39.920
I guess all the more than 20 girls in this family despise her.

12
00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.340
I must have been deceived by your lady

13
00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:45.400
Why are you two used everywhere?

14
00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.460
How could it be possible that I’m here to shout when I’m taking a test?

15
00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:55.630
But you marry such a person

16
00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:57.410
It's because you committed a crime and owed it to your family

17
00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:59.240
What are you going to do yourself?

18
00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.470
Listen to me

19
00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:05.489
Lu Bai, what method did you use?

20
00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:08.180
I am his mother

21
00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:09.740
I tell you very seriously

22
00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:13.190
I don't admit it

23
00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:16.870
Jian Jian's case is coming soon

24
00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:18.430
My daughter is divorced

25
00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.960
Are you talking about the qualifications of wood again?

26
00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:31.930
I'll give it a try

27
00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:33.540
Even if you make half a turn

28
00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.130
Why do you have so many people?

29
00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.170
They are all so familiar.

30
00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.590
Let me tell you, why don't you have some?

31
00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.290
Like you

32
00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:45.270
Those who deliver food and those who watch Baoan

33
00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:48.870
How can I participate

34
00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.200
Stop working with someone as tall as Auntie

35
00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.520
Don’t you know?

36
00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:58.190
I will arrange a girl in China for you

37
00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:01.030
You cried on both ends of the middle face

38
00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:07.190
I haven’t told you what happened just now
