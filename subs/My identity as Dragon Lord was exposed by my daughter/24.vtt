00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:04.640
Who doesn’t know that they have worked for many years without participating in this battle?

2
00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:07.520
It doesn't matter if you have money, I have 200 things,

3
00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:10.260
All unparalleled, do you think I can,

4
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.480
Are you afraid of your threats? I came from thousands of miles away to attend the Chamber of Commerce.

5
00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:17.020
You guys at Baylor,

6
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.780
Just forget it if you don’t have the mentality to lose.

7
00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:22.240
And let these few people worry about their positions,

8
00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:25.360
Since you are still making it so difficult for me,

9
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.320
It is my country that you should protect,

10
00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:31.010
It doesn’t count if you hug Yifa too

11
00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:34.760
We can duel you before

12
00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:39.980
I can make you sit down and get used to me

13
00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:41.800
It's a greeting to you

14
00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:45.970
Finally showing your true face

15
00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:50.500
In the big direction, don’t know how big it is

16
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.910
I won't allow you to ignore the Chinese people like this

17
00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.420
Please apologize immediately

18
00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.940
When you are no one enter me

19
00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.600
I'm your boss

20
00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:13.020
That's when I fell too

21
00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:15.120
If I hadn't fallen down

22
00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:17.170
One gift belt

23
00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:19.030
Not a city from a foreign country

24
00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:23.860
I'm not polite to you

25
00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:32.540
It's not easy to pick you up

26
00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:34.400
Don't blame me for being rude

27
00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.330
Find us you

28
00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.870
Don't touch, don't move
