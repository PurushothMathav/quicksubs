00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:00.566
Yesterday

2
00:00:00.566 --> 00:00:03.200
A major industrial accident has occurred in this city

3
00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:05.366
Wanfeng Construction site collapsed

4
00:00:05.466 --> 00:00:07.466
All 13 workers were killed

5
00:00:07.533 --> 00:00:10.300
I pay everything I pay

6
00:00:10.566 --> 00:00:11.966
I don't have it now.

7
00:00:11.966 --> 00:00:13.400
But that doesn't mean I won't have it in the future

8
00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.700
My king tiger speaks with absolute caution

9
00:00:16.533 --> 00:00:17.966
Tiger Lord Tiger Lord

10
00:00:18.933 --> 00:00:19.966
I did the math.

11
00:00:19.966 --> 00:00:22.766
Look at your yintang turning black

12
00:00:22.966 --> 00:00:24.366
Seven Kills

13
00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:26.566
Especially the earth devil

14
00:00:26.666 --> 00:00:29.200
Don't pass the construction site tonight

15
00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.433
To avoid disaster

16
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.166
What's the matter boy

17
00:00:35.333 --> 00:00:37.966
Curse me, don't believe it

18
00:00:38.066 --> 00:00:39.700
You can buy the French team with me

19
00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:42.066
That way, even if something goes wrong, there is money to pay

20
00:00:42.066 --> 00:00:43.466
No go

21
00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.400
This broken color wheel makes so much money

22
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.400
I've never seen so much money in my life

23
00:01:01.466 --> 00:01:02.766
This money will buy 10 suites, right?

24
00:01:02.766 --> 00:01:06.000
Tiger, we are really here to sell lottery tickets

25
00:01:06.133 --> 00:01:07.766
2 million all France

26
00:01:07.766 --> 00:01:09.966
Little brother, do you really want to buy France?

27
00:01:09.966 --> 00:01:10.966
Have you considered it?

28
00:01:10.966 --> 00:01:13.633
Buy France without thinking about it

29
00:01:13.866 --> 00:01:14.766
Don't make trouble if you lose.

30
00:01:14.766 --> 00:01:15.666
You follow me to buy

31
00:01:15.666 --> 00:01:16.966
Make money tonight

32
00:01:16.966 --> 00:01:20.533
Tiger Lord, I think you are actually quite good

33
00:01:20.533 --> 00:01:21.433
Think about it.

34
00:01:26.066 --> 00:01:27.700
Give me 200,000 France win
