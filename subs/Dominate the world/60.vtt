00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:00.666
I didn't expect it.

2
00:00:00.666 --> 00:00:03.200
The one pressing the bottom of the box turned out to be just a broken three-flower porcelain

3
00:00:03.366 --> 00:00:04.400
This blue and white porcelain

4
00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:05.933
I can't be with Master at all

5
00:00:05.933 --> 00:00:06.966
The antiques I bought

6
00:00:06.966 --> 00:00:08.500
More in my opinion

7
00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:11.000
This three-flower porcelain is only worth 1 million

8
00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:15.266
500,000 600,000 hey

9
00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.600
Lu Yao doesn't mean anything else

10
00:00:19.066 --> 00:00:21.766
I am against you today with pure heart

11
00:00:22.333 --> 00:00:24.900
I don't like this crap either

12
00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.766
It's just like raising a fight with you

13
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.300
1 million

14
00:00:30.466 --> 00:00:31.866
Lu Yao this

15
00:00:33.866 --> 00:00:35.666
Master, do you have the ability to continue?

16
00:00:35.666 --> 00:00:38.200
It's not my money anyway

17
00:00:39.166 --> 00:00:39.966
Lu Yao

18
00:00:40.333 --> 00:00:41.400
This broken altar cloud

19
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.333
Just treat it as a gift from Ben Shao.

20
00:00:43.333 --> 00:00:45.800
Just as I send you to the end

21
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.533
Hahaha ok

22
00:00:47.533 --> 00:00:50.966
Master, don't regret it

23
00:00:50.966 --> 00:00:54.466
Ming Dynasty official kiln blue and white porcelain belongs to Miss Shi

24
00:00:54.466 --> 00:00:56.333
I declare this auction

25
00:00:56.333 --> 00:01:00.366
Shi Tianzong received the final total price of 330 million

26
00:01:00.366 --> 00:01:02.666
Shi Yaxian received a total price of

27
00:01:07.333 --> 00:01:08.333
Master

28
00:01:08.333 --> 00:01:11.700
I will teach you what it means to have no eyeballs today
