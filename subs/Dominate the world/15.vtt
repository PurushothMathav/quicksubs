00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.400
You don't understand the ball when you look at it

2
00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:03.400
Take a woman to brag, bro

3
00:00:03.466 --> 00:00:05.566
The clothes you're wearing are torn and there's no money

4
00:00:05.566 --> 00:00:07.600
Go home now, oops

5
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.366
I have money, how much do you say tonight?

6
00:00:11.366 --> 00:00:12.166
I'll take it all.

7
00:00:12.166 --> 00:00:14.666
Today's events are a bit far away, which is 16 times.

8
00:00:14.666 --> 00:00:17.666
But we're not a piece of junk

9
00:00:17.666 --> 00:00:19.500
Brother, let's go

10
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.200
Boss, you misunderstood.

11
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.766
I don't have any junk in here

12
00:00:23.766 --> 00:00:25.866
It's all money

13
00:00:25.866 --> 00:00:28.100
You told me it was full of money

14
00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:29.266
Take me for a fool.

15
00:00:29.266 --> 00:00:31.733
Hahahaha brother, hurry up and go.

16
00:00:31.733 --> 00:00:33.200
Don't delay my birthday.

17
00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.233
The boss really has money in it.

18
00:00:36.366 --> 00:00:38.000
I'll go with you

19
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.466
Boss, just say whether to do my business or not.

20
00:00:41.466 --> 00:00:43.166
How could he not do it?

21
00:00:43.166 --> 00:00:46.100
I've never seen a tricycle crash into money

22
00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:47.633
Let me see. OK.

23
00:00:47.966 --> 00:00:49.233
Bring my brother to see

24
00:00:49.533 --> 00:00:52.766
I heard that there is a fool who wants to buy the French team

25
00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:54.766
I'd like to see it today

26
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.500
What kind of fool doesn't know the ball?

27
00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:58.866
Isn't this Boss Wang?

28
00:00:58.866 --> 00:01:00.466
Which team should I buy today?

29
00:01:00.466 --> 00:01:01.666
Take Boss Wang to buy the ball.

30
00:01:01.666 --> 00:01:04.566
I have won hundreds. Welcome, Boss Wang.

31
00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:06.500
You're welcome.

32
00:01:07.666 --> 00:01:11.400
Yo, this is not the same Tianjiao sister as business.

33
00:01:12.066 --> 00:01:14.500
How did you get along?

34
00:01:15.266 --> 00:01:16.266
Yo girl

35
00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.266
That's not it.

36
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.433
Yo, it's my brother

37
00:01:21.466 --> 00:01:23.133
Do you want to buy a ball?

38
00:01:23.133 --> 00:01:25.033
Do you want me to teach you twice?

39
00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.400
As long as Sister Tian Diao dances with Master at night

40
00:01:29.666 --> 00:01:31.400
You are the boss of Wanfeng Entrepreneurship

41
00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.433
The king tiger known as the tiger fish

42
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.633
Hey, it is a generation of king tigers
