00:00:00.466 --> 00:00:03.566
It was Tiger Wang who told you, it seems that it is Mr. Lu

2
00:00:03.566 --> 00:00:04.700
Introduce yourself

3
00:00:04.766 --> 00:00:07.400
I'm Wang Linjian dressing up other directors

4
00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.033
Also the master of the cloud-topped sky

5
00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:15.800
Oh, Mr. Lu

6
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.066
I was wrong, it's all my fault.

7
00:00:18.266 --> 00:00:20.733
I shouldn't understand what you guys say

8
00:00:20.733 --> 00:00:22.666
Just say something nice to the fat man

9
00:00:22.733 --> 00:00:24.466
I can't live without this job.

10
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.000
You want to fire him?

11
00:00:26.066 --> 00:00:27.200
Now that's snobbery.

12
00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.566
Even you look down on it

13
00:00:28.666 --> 00:00:29.766
I don't fire him

14
00:00:30.166 --> 00:00:33.900
People who drive like this should have been fired long ago

15
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:37.133
By the way, I remember that Yang Hailiang

16
00:00:37.133 --> 00:00:38.633
It is also triggered in your conscience

17
00:00:38.733 --> 00:00:41.200
As for him, you should know what to do.

18
00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.100
I understand after going back to prison?

19
00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:44.100
I'll drive right away

20
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.633
Somebody drive him away from me

21
00:00:48.666 --> 00:00:50.766
In the future, I don't want to be at home in Le Cheng

22
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:52.966
Mr. Luo

23
00:00:52.966 --> 00:00:53.733
Give me a break.

24
00:00:53.733 --> 00:00:55.500
Spare my second sister

25
00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.500
We can't be soft-hearted towards this kind of person

26
00:00:57.766 --> 00:01:00.566
Soft-hearted, remember to give me a discount on his legs.

27
00:01:00.566 --> 00:01:02.200
Dare to scold my aunt

28
00:01:03.466 --> 00:01:06.066
Oh, what's the matter with you coming to me?

29
00:01:06.066 --> 00:01:07.800
Mr. Lu is telling the truth

30
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.400
Recently?

31
00:01:09.566 --> 00:01:12.133
There is something wrong with the capital chain of Dawan Group

32
00:01:12.133 --> 00:01:13.333
I want your help.

33
00:01:13.333 --> 00:01:13.933
I didn't expect it.

34
00:01:13.933 --> 00:01:16.900
20 years later, the famous Dawan Group Wang Linjian

35
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.133
There was such a problem back then

36
00:01:19.133 --> 00:01:21.300
Okay, Mr. Wang, just say it directly

37
00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.600
How much do you want? 20 million
