1
00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.600
Yes, sir, I know

2
00:00:03.266 --> 00:00:05.066
Ahaha

3
00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:07.266
Hahaha

4
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.066
Was it my sister last time?

5
00:00:11.066 --> 00:00:13.300
Let you shout face in the cloud-topped sky

6
00:00:13.733 --> 00:00:15.300
As long as you can obey

7
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:18.266
I promise you that's not necessarily the case today.

8
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.366
Yes, yes, I see.

9
00:00:22.366 --> 00:00:23.300
fool

10
00:00:23.733 --> 00:00:25.933
You were lucky last time, I'll let you go

11
00:00:25.933 --> 00:00:27.600
But today I'll give you one more chance.

12
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.100
You just get the hell out of here

13
00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:33.833
I promise, will I teach you what happened before?

14
00:00:34.133 --> 00:00:35.100
Otherwise

15
00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:36.500
You die

16
00:00:39.466 --> 00:00:42.066
Miss, they are about to start, please remember

17
00:00:54.733 --> 00:00:55.700
Say what?

18
00:00:56.866 --> 00:00:57.666
i

19
00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.300
Miss, your place is ready for you.

20
00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:07.400
Right in the first row

21
00:01:08.366 --> 00:01:12.800
Miss Xie, this is the next one, right?

22
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.200
Well, as I said last time

23
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.133
You'll also stop this time.

24
00:01:17.133 --> 00:01:19.500
But judging by personal worth

25
00:01:19.733 --> 00:01:21.500
Shi Tianzong, don't mess around

26
00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.466
I've never heard of such rules

27
00:01:23.533 --> 00:01:25.633
Sis, how busy are you?

28
00:01:25.666 --> 00:01:26.966
I didn't tell you.

29
00:01:26.966 --> 00:01:28.600
It's normal that you don't know

30
00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.300
Oh, what about the first row?

31
00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:35.400
It's worth hundreds of millions of dollars, the total position we impose

32
00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.800
And what about this second row?

33
00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.600
It is the two that are worth tens of millions

34
00:01:40.266 --> 00:01:41.600
Let's talk about this third row

35
00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.400
There are three beautiful women worth only a few million

36
00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:47.866
As for your identity

37
00:01:48.733 --> 00:01:49.900
Where do you fit?
