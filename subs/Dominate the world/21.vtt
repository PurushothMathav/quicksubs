00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.133
Miss Anna

2
00:00:01.133 --> 00:00:03.533
I remember that your country should not allow it now.

3
00:00:03.533 --> 00:00:04.800
Businessperson in a private capacity

4
00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.166
Scalping. Scalping.

5
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.166
Are you going crazy?

6
00:00:14.333 --> 00:00:16.033
This foreign girl is too popular

7
00:00:16.066 --> 00:00:17.366
Calm down Miss Anna

8
00:00:17.366 --> 00:00:19.066
I just want to talk to you about business

9
00:00:19.133 --> 00:00:20.200
What business?

10
00:00:23.066 --> 00:00:23.966
Yo Ayao

11
00:00:25.366 --> 00:00:26.666
Do you still know

12
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.366
What about foreigners?

13
00:00:28.733 --> 00:00:30.366
Haha, just met

14
00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.466
Who are you going to hit?

15
00:00:34.466 --> 00:00:35.800
What do you want?

16
00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.300
Really, what do you have?

17
00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.866
Motorcycles are very good in our country.

18
00:00:40.866 --> 00:00:42.966
Motorcycles in your country have a high throttle.

19
00:00:42.966 --> 00:00:44.900
Power foot anti-drop

20
00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:45.866
Very cool.

21
00:00:46.333 --> 00:00:48.500
Suitable for a pure wild wife like me

22
00:00:48.966 --> 00:00:51.533
Master, what can you do with me?

23
00:00:51.533 --> 00:00:53.733
Blankets, it's cold there.

24
00:00:53.733 --> 00:00:55.366
If the supplies are not enough

25
00:00:55.366 --> 00:00:56.866
I'm afraid many people will die

26
00:00:56.866 --> 00:00:58.533
I have my coat here.

27
00:00:58.533 --> 00:00:59.866
Quilt blanket

28
00:00:59.866 --> 00:01:01.966
I have a kettle, anything you want

29
00:01:02.066 --> 00:01:04.733
Why don't you try this with a leather blanket first?

30
00:01:04.733 --> 00:01:05.566
You are so smart

31
00:01:05.566 --> 00:01:07.866
I rarely meet people like you.

32
00:01:07.866 --> 00:01:08.900
What's your name?

33
00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:10.466
My name is deer head

34
00:01:10.466 --> 00:01:12.266
Well, if it's ok

35
00:01:12.266 --> 00:01:14.633
I'll send someone to trade with you in three days.

36
00:01:14.733 --> 00:01:18.166
At that time, how many deskmates do you have?

37
00:01:18.166 --> 00:01:19.366
It's ok.

38
00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.600
Mr. Slave, maybe before the deal

39
00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.000
We can fall into petty evil
