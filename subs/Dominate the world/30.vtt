00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:01.966
Hey, don't go

2
00:00:01.966 --> 00:00:02.933
Don't admit it

3
00:00:02.933 --> 00:00:06.033
I already said this man is a piece of crap

4
00:00:06.066 --> 00:00:07.900
He must be unable to pretend

5
00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:10.500
He ran away with his cheap sister

6
00:00:11.866 --> 00:00:12.666
Mr. Yang

7
00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:15.166
If I see him next time, I will definitely avenge you.

8
00:00:15.166 --> 00:00:16.900
Haha, you two.

9
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:19.133
You show me him.

10
00:00:19.133 --> 00:00:20.900
Looking for someone, thank you

11
00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:22.400
You have good eyesight

12
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.333
Looking back like this, I saw Mr. Wang

13
00:00:24.333 --> 00:00:25.666
Give you more beauty

14
00:00:25.866 --> 00:00:28.766
Let you get a raise in salary, hahahaha, okay?

15
00:00:28.966 --> 00:00:29.766
Be a manager

16
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.200
Mr. Wang, why are you here?

17
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.866
Did a young man surnamed Lu come over just now?

18
00:00:34.866 --> 00:00:35.666
Bought a flower

19
00:00:35.666 --> 00:00:36.800
Where is he?

20
00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.000
Mr. Wang, I have chased him away

21
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.266
He comes from the countryside.

22
00:00:40.266 --> 00:00:41.200
Pardon me?

23
00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.366
Mr. Wang, I asked him to do this

24
00:00:43.366 --> 00:00:44.766
You

25
00:00:44.766 --> 00:00:47.566
Mr. Wang, Brother Yang is the director of Dawan Group

26
00:00:47.566 --> 00:00:48.566
Don't you remember?

27
00:00:48.566 --> 00:00:50.066
So many parts of the Dawan Group

28
00:00:50.066 --> 00:00:52.466
Every director I have to recognize this shut up

29
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.133
President Wang can't be such a small person as President Day, right?

30
00:00:55.133 --> 00:00:57.666
Right, hahaha, that Mr. Wang, you are busy first.

31
00:00:57.733 --> 00:00:58.533
We'll go first

32
00:00:58.533 --> 00:01:02.766
Oops, hahahaha, you just said to drive people away.

33
00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.200
