00:00:00.566 --> 00:00:03.600
Well, since you really want to die

2
00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:04.866
Then I will fulfill it.

3
00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:11.966
Thank you for nominating me as a teacher

4
00:00:12.166 --> 00:00:13.533
As the president of this chamber of commerce

5
00:00:13.533 --> 00:00:15.166
Chairperson Shi is young and rich

6
00:00:15.166 --> 00:00:17.200
One person in charge of the teaching enterprise

7
00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:18.266
Invest with him

8
00:00:18.266 --> 00:00:19.466
make sure you don't lose

9
00:00:19.666 --> 00:00:22.466
That's right, if such a good opportunity is missed

10
00:00:22.466 --> 00:00:24.466
Isn't that brain just caught in the door?

11
00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.300
Oh, one more thing.

12
00:00:28.366 --> 00:00:29.900
It's our company's stock

13
00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:31.300
I'm sure you have some friends

14
00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:32.766
It should have been started.

15
00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.100
The stock rallied violently

16
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.166
I don't think it will be long

17
00:00:37.166 --> 00:00:39.133
You can go to NASDAQ to ring the bell

18
00:00:39.133 --> 00:00:41.133
This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity

19
00:00:41.133 --> 00:00:43.866
That's right, I have transferred our company's liquidity

20
00:00:43.933 --> 00:00:44.566
All bought

21
00:00:44.566 --> 00:00:45.666
Do you think you are the only one who is smart?

22
00:00:45.666 --> 00:00:47.066
I bought it a week ago

23
00:00:47.066 --> 00:00:48.533
You have such a good thing not to tell me

24
00:00:48.533 --> 00:00:49.600
No, I have to buy some, too.

25
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.200
Hey, it's still too late to invest now.

26
00:00:52.666 --> 00:00:54.700
From the very beginning, the computer was broken

27
00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:55.800
What are you doing?

28
00:00:56.133 --> 00:00:57.533
Don't they like to call?

29
00:00:57.533 --> 00:01:00.966
Make it directly for their stock visit snacks to eat

30
00:01:01.766 --> 00:01:04.033
But you have to work so many stocks at once.

31
00:01:04.066 --> 00:01:05.166
It is not easy to develop

32
00:01:05.166 --> 00:01:06.566
Shopping malls are like battlefields

33
00:01:06.566 --> 00:01:07.733
What is serious?

34
00:01:07.733 --> 00:01:11.033
It's money. You feel like you're short of money now.
