1
00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.233
I don't know, it's inconvenient.

2
00:00:08.666 --> 00:00:10.200
Ah, Mr. Gu

3
00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:12.666
If you think it's too much

4
00:00:12.666 --> 00:00:13.800
We can discuss it again.

5
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:15.100
It's okay, Mr. Wang

6
00:00:15.466 --> 00:00:17.666
I have also heard of the Dawan Group

7
00:00:17.666 --> 00:00:20.100
If I can be of any help this time

8
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.800
Let's make friends

9
00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.966
20 million in this card

10
00:00:24.566 --> 00:00:25.400
You take it first

11
00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.333
You can directly go to Lecheng Bank to take it out.

12
00:00:27.333 --> 00:00:28.066
Brother Lu

13
00:00:28.066 --> 00:00:29.133
You are so atmospheric

14
00:00:29.133 --> 00:00:30.166
But don't worry.

15
00:00:30.166 --> 00:00:32.400
I will definitely pay you back the money as soon as possible.

16
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:33.300
Don't worry.

17
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.666
Mr. Wang, you can take this money.

18
00:00:35.766 --> 00:00:39.100
Think of it as my investment in Dawan Group

19
00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:40.200
Look at this money

20
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.400
How much equity do you have in your company?

21
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:43.466
Tell me a number.

22
00:00:43.533 --> 00:00:44.333
Mr. Lu

23
00:00:44.766 --> 00:00:47.300
Your answer is in jeopardy

24
00:00:47.466 --> 00:00:49.266
I'll give you 30%.

25
00:00:49.266 --> 00:00:51.200
I've been thinking about building Dawan

26
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:52.400
The group's business circle

27
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:53.466
After it's built?

28
00:00:53.466 --> 00:00:55.866
You are the highest responsible person in Le City

29
00:00:55.866 --> 00:00:58.200
Then I'll wait for your good news, Mr. Wang.

30
00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.366
This is the highest specification villa in Genting Tiangong

31
00:01:03.466 --> 00:01:04.600
Please laugh

32
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.266
Ok, thanks.

33
00:01:09.266 --> 00:01:10.533
If nothing else

34
00:01:10.533 --> 00:01:12.200
I'll take my leave first

35
00:01:14.966 --> 00:01:17.800
Xiaoyao, you just send out 20 million like this

36
00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.733
And I have a hunch

37
00:01:19.733 --> 00:01:20.966
In the coming years

38
00:01:20.966 --> 00:01:21.933
Dawan Group

39
00:01:21.933 --> 00:01:24.666
It will definitely go from a small playground to the world

40
00:01:24.666 --> 00:01:26.666
To become the world's leading real estate developer

41
00:01:26.666 --> 00:01:28.400
We can make money then

42
00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.200
But it's not the 20 million in front of you

43
00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:34.866
Really, then don't we make it big?

44
00:01:39.066 --> 00:01:39.566
Lord Deer

45
00:01:39.566 --> 00:01:42.566
What was your eldest sister bullied by in the factory?
