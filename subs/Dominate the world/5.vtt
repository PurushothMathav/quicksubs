00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:04.200
Oops what are you doing

2
00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:05.366
Sorry, yeah.

3
00:00:06.733 --> 00:00:07.533
cannot afford

4
00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:10.700
I passed the exam like this.

5
00:00:10.766 --> 00:00:12.033
You get up

6
00:00:12.333 --> 00:00:14.266
No matter how poor our Lu family is

7
00:00:14.266 --> 00:00:16.033
Can't kneel down to anyone

8
00:00:16.166 --> 00:00:18.933
Not even my sister

9
00:00:18.933 --> 00:00:21.266
You know what? I know.

10
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.900
Oh, you really want to divorce that Wu Qianqian?

11
00:00:29.066 --> 00:00:30.200
Divorce is fine

12
00:00:30.466 --> 00:00:32.900
Don't want a woman like Wu Qianqian

13
00:00:34.566 --> 00:00:35.600
Don't worry.

14
00:00:35.733 --> 00:00:37.500
I'm not that Luoyang anymore

15
00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:39.566
I'm going to make a lot of money soon

16
00:00:40.566 --> 00:00:43.466
Oh, hurry up and return this money first.

17
00:00:43.466 --> 00:00:45.533
It's not enough. Your second sister and I have to find a way.

18
00:00:45.533 --> 00:00:48.700
You have to promise me that I really can't gamble anymore

19
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.600
Don't worry, sister.

20
00:00:52.333 --> 00:00:55.766
I will definitely give you the best life.

21
00:01:02.733 --> 00:01:04.400
Stock Internet

22
00:01:04.533 --> 00:01:06.666
Crude oil real estate

23
00:01:06.866 --> 00:01:09.466
Antiques have so many opportunities in this era

24
00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.200
Which one should I catch first?

25
00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.500
And these all require start-up capital

26
00:01:14.866 --> 00:01:15.866
Yes.

27
00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.566
owe owe

28
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:19.966
The last time I saw a bowl at your house

29
00:01:19.966 --> 00:01:21.000
So big three times

30
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.466
Where did the food go?

31
00:01:22.466 --> 00:01:23.766
My mother fed it to the dog

32
00:01:23.766 --> 00:01:24.600
What the hell?

33
00:01:25.333 --> 00:01:27.166
I just saw the exact same one on TV

34
00:01:27.166 --> 00:01:29.033
It sold for more than 1 million.

35
00:01:30.366 --> 00:01:33.133
In his last life, Yang Hailiang took this dog bowl.

36
00:01:33.133 --> 00:01:34.766
Finally, it was identified as Tang Sancai

37
00:01:34.766 --> 00:01:36.200
Sold for 3 million

38
00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.233
He's mine now.

39
00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.300
King, I am now

40
00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:43.866
To make a lot of money
