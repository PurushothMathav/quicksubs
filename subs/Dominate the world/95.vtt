00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:01.300
No, I don't.

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.233
Of course I don't care about you anymore

3
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:07.866
My cousin became the president that day

4
00:00:07.866 --> 00:00:10.366
I know to run errands for you every day

5
00:00:10.466 --> 00:00:13.266
Don't worry, how could I possibly just let you run errands?

6
00:00:13.266 --> 00:00:14.566
My second sister is good at literature and art

7
00:00:14.566 --> 00:00:16.800
So I put him in charge of the media company

8
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:17.800
You are good at business

9
00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.866
Of course I'll pave the way for you

10
00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:22.766
Really. Hmm.

11
00:00:22.933 --> 00:00:24.766
Come with me tomorrow to meet two people

12
00:00:24.766 --> 00:00:26.833
I made you a cop too, really

13
00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:29.666
Then I forgive you.

14
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.266
Well I don't forgive you hum

15
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:36.000
How did it go?

16
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.266
How are you thinking about the contract between the two Masters?

17
00:00:39.766 --> 00:00:43.166
Mr. Lu invested in Ababa and didn't know how much he wanted

18
00:00:43.166 --> 00:00:43.966
Equity ratio

19
00:00:46.733 --> 00:00:49.600
Hahaha Mr. Lu

20
00:00:50.066 --> 00:00:52.366
70% is too much

21
00:00:52.466 --> 00:00:53.600
If so

22
00:00:53.666 --> 00:00:55.866
I, Abba, will be directly controlled by you.

23
00:00:55.866 --> 00:00:58.466
Then don't I become a worker for you?

24
00:00:58.466 --> 00:01:01.533
And we've raised 20 million dollars now.

25
00:01:01.533 --> 00:01:04.333
Although you have raised 20 million so far

26
00:01:04.333 --> 00:01:05.133
But

27
00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.500
The company's current main business has always been wholesale

28
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.000
A must-see market for trade

29
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.433
It's how businesses interact with each other.

30
00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.366
But with the continuous development of socialization

31
00:01:13.366 --> 00:01:15.166
The continuous improvement of the degree of informatization

32
00:01:15.166 --> 00:01:17.400
I think your development

33
00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:18.866
Will run away sooner or later

34
00:01:19.166 --> 00:01:20.566
It's a real problem.

35
00:01:20.566 --> 00:01:23.666
It's been bothering us now

36
00:01:23.966 --> 00:01:27.400
I think we should immediately switch to the b-picture-c model

37
00:01:27.533 --> 00:01:30.266
Directly let consumers face merchants

38
00:01:30.266 --> 00:01:31.700
Break the must-come between the two

39
00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.766
That's a good idea.

40
00:01:34.966 --> 00:01:36.433
Oops but

41
00:01:37.266 --> 00:01:39.666
The development of enterprises in the 1980s

42
00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.866
This operation program cannot be added to the consumer side.

43
00:01:43.266 --> 00:01:44.000
Very simple.

44
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.700
You can establish a rice e-commerce platform.

45
00:01:46.866 --> 00:01:49.400
Treat consumers and merchants as users

46
00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:50.966
Drainage to our platform

47
00:01:50.966 --> 00:01:53.266
Let the two parties trade at Taomi

48
00:01:53.333 --> 00:01:56.600
At the same time, we can charge a security deposit from the merchant.

49
00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.966
But we can do paid promotion.

50
00:01:58.966 --> 00:02:00.733
In the future, it can also be achieved through advertising

51
00:02:00.733 --> 00:02:01.566
To make a profit

52
00:02:01.566 --> 00:02:04.700
No, it's great

53
00:02:04.766 --> 00:02:07.400
In addition, the establishment of a payment cloud third-party payment platform

54
00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:08.200
Platform

55
00:02:08.466 --> 00:02:11.400
Binding the Taomi account becomes the credit system of both parties

56
00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.366
It can also attract more users in the future

57
00:02:13.366 --> 00:02:14.466
Come to the payment cloud

58
00:02:14.466 --> 00:02:17.066
Launch financial profits

59
00:02:17.133 --> 00:02:20.633
That's wonderful, Mr. Lu, you are really a god
