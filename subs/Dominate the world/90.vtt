Making a movie Tianjiao

2
00:00:01.866 --> 00:00:03.533
Did you make a movie?

3
00:00:03.533 --> 00:00:04.766
Yes, yes, Tianjiao

4
00:00:04.766 --> 00:00:06.066
You've been on fire lately

5
00:00:06.066 --> 00:00:07.100
Workers in the factory?

6
00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:08.366
They're all talking about you

7
00:00:08.466 --> 00:00:09.166
eldest sister

8
00:00:09.166 --> 00:00:12.300
This is all packed for me with exposed teeth, of course.

9
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.000
And you have to have a body, you have to have a face, you have to have a face.

10
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.066
How can you not make a movie?

11
00:00:18.066 --> 00:00:20.700
Ah, sister, you also want a figure and figure.

12
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:22.166
Big face

13
00:00:23.066 --> 00:00:25.233
Yes, of course there is.

14
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.566
When I pair it up, look at my face.

15
00:00:27.566 --> 00:00:28.500
I treat you well

16
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:29.433
You shameless

17
00:00:29.733 --> 00:00:30.666
As for you

18
00:00:30.666 --> 00:00:31.866
Just when you are number 3

19
00:00:32.133 --> 00:00:33.466
It won't be a man.

20
00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:34.900
Dress up as a woman

21
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.533
When the time comes

22
00:00:36.533 --> 00:00:39.166
The three of us will sleep

23
00:00:40.666 --> 00:00:43.366
Hey, how can I make any movies?

24
00:00:43.366 --> 00:00:45.800
I will manage the factory at most

25
00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:47.733
Sister, don't refuse

26
00:00:47.733 --> 00:00:49.666
Or I'll sell you your name

27
00:00:49.666 --> 00:00:51.400
What do you have with me?

28
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.166
Don't talk nonsense

29
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:57.333
Uh, does Du Yao need a lot of money to make a movie?

30
00:00:57.333 --> 00:00:59.433
It's okay, we're not short of money.

31
00:00:59.733 --> 00:01:01.000
That Boss Lu

32
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.566
When do we open?

33
00:01:03.733 --> 00:01:07.366
I'm holding a press conference tomorrow

34
00:01:07.366 --> 00:01:10.400
Officially announced its entry into the film and television industry
