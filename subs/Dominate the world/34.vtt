00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:02.266
Pay, you don't have eyes?

2
00:00:02.266 --> 00:00:03.266
This mechanic is broken

3
00:00:03.266 --> 00:00:04.966
You will compensate us for the loss of work stoppage.

4
00:00:04.966 --> 00:00:06.600
This dress is not mine.

5
00:00:06.666 --> 00:00:08.600
It was you who threw it in

6
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:10.966
You are talking nonsense, everyone can see it clearly?

7
00:00:10.966 --> 00:00:13.200
Obviously, this woman's plan was broken.

8
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.900
Framing me every day

9
00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:15.766
Ouch.

10
00:00:16.466 --> 00:00:19.300
This shameless little hoof

11
00:00:19.533 --> 00:00:23.100
Heaven Wu Xiaowei and Honest Man, I don't live anymore

12
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.500
Haha open air phoenix

13
00:00:24.666 --> 00:00:26.133
You usually look pretty honest

14
00:00:26.133 --> 00:00:27.900
I didn't expect you to frame Director Li

15
00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.033
You are so shameless

16
00:00:29.066 --> 00:00:30.966
I don't know how this open-air phoenix got in

17
00:00:30.966 --> 00:00:33.500
Does it have anything to do with the factory manager in the plane?

18
00:00:33.566 --> 00:00:35.933
No, I have nothing to do with the factory manager.

19
00:00:35.933 --> 00:00:37.866
This dress was thrown in by him.

20
00:00:37.866 --> 00:00:39.800
If you don't believe me, you can check the surveillance.

21
00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.266
You fart, obviously you still don't admit it, hey

22
00:00:43.266 --> 00:00:44.800
Instead, clean me up

23
00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.066
What are you all doing?

24
00:00:47.066 --> 00:00:50.166
Isn't it working? How can you call the shots for us?

25
00:00:50.166 --> 00:00:51.366
This open-air phoenix

26
00:00:51.366 --> 00:00:53.800
Not only did the littering of clothes ruin the military training

27
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.766
Said I did it

28
00:00:55.966 --> 00:00:58.300
Factory manager, I'm so old

29
00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.100
Can I do something shameful?

30
00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:01.666
Ouch I'm dead

31
00:01:01.666 --> 00:01:02.766
Okay, okay, Li Guan

32
00:01:03.266 --> 00:01:04.366
Stop crying.

33
00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:05.766
The factory manager calls the shots for you.

34
00:01:08.133 --> 00:01:09.133
Now what?

35
00:01:09.133 --> 00:01:11.033
I didn't do the factory manager

36
00:01:12.166 --> 00:01:12.966
Ah!

37
00:01:13.566 --> 00:01:16.966
The machine broke down and delayed how much my father earns
