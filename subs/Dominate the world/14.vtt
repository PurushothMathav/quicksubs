00:00:00.766 --> 00:00:04.466
What bowl sold for more than eight million

2
00:00:04.466 --> 00:00:05.100
Right.

3
00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.500
If you don't believe me, go to the city and ask the pawn shop owner.

4
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.033
He originally wanted two pairs, but he didn't grab it. Who wants to pick it up?

5
00:00:10.566 --> 00:00:11.900
Liar in the past

6
00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:13.666
Tianjiao, look at him

7
00:00:13.666 --> 00:00:16.800
I'll go to the city and ask what's going on, sister

8
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.300
It's so late, don't go, don't worry

9
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.466
Even if my heart is so much older than my sister

10
00:00:23.466 --> 00:00:25.300
Grandpa was eaten to death by him

11
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:27.933
Stay put.

12
00:00:27.933 --> 00:00:30.200
Why did you hit me again?

13
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.666
You haven't explained it to me yet.

14
00:00:31.666 --> 00:00:35.000
What does that have to do with you?

15
00:00:35.366 --> 00:00:38.166
Don't tell me you're just a business relationship

16
00:00:38.733 --> 00:00:40.833
Anyone with a good eye can see it

17
00:00:40.966 --> 00:00:42.433
He's definitely interested in you.

18
00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.566
Yasen is also interested in me.

19
00:00:44.566 --> 00:00:46.100
Am I that attractive?

20
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.533
Oh, sister, don't think too much, I promise you.

21
00:00:50.533 --> 00:00:52.200
No matter where I go to the gym in the future

22
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.100
I must tell you two first, okay?

23
00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.000
In the past, when you were in the orphanage, the eldest sister doted on you the most

24
00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.266
Let alone now

25
00:00:58.266 --> 00:01:00.300
As long as you say it, how could he not agree?

26
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.766
I'm just afraid of some people.

27
00:01:02.766 --> 00:01:03.866
Same as before

28
00:01:03.866 --> 00:01:06.700
After getting married, I forgot about the two of us

29
00:01:06.866 --> 00:01:09.966
Dear sister who is not related by blood

30
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.300
Oops ok my sister

31
00:01:12.566 --> 00:01:13.333
I promise you.

32
00:01:13.333 --> 00:01:15.133
No matter what happens to me in the future

33
00:01:15.133 --> 00:01:17.466
The three of us will never be apart

34
00:01:21.333 --> 00:01:22.500
Just your sweet mouth

35
00:01:22.966 --> 00:01:24.466
I'm just checking for you.

36
00:01:24.466 --> 00:01:26.700
You can't be single forever, can you?

37
00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:27.466
Yeah.

38
00:01:27.466 --> 00:01:30.633
Don't I still have my beautiful sister?
