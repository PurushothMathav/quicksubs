00:00:00.066 --> 00:00:01.733
Wait a minute it's miss

2
00:00:01.733 --> 00:00:03.600
This Mr. Chen is our friend.

3
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:04.600
Go let him stay here

4
00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:06.766
I rely on my luck

5
00:00:06.766 --> 00:00:08.500
As soon as I went out, I met Chen Qiaosheng

6
00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:09.866
The future richest man

7
00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:12.233
You two are

8
00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:13.933
Hello, Mr. Chen.

9
00:00:13.933 --> 00:00:14.833
My name is Lu Yao

10
00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.700
Mr. Lu, thank you for listening to my explanation just now.

11
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:18.666
You're welcome.

12
00:00:18.666 --> 00:00:20.233
You are no ordinary person

13
00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.100
Why would Mr. Lu say that?

14
00:00:24.166 --> 00:00:24.966
Hey

15
00:00:25.366 --> 00:00:26.466
Here's my card.

16
00:00:26.466 --> 00:00:28.133
I will contact you later.

17
00:00:28.133 --> 00:00:31.166
Let me discuss with you how to develop the game display.

18
00:00:32.133 --> 00:00:33.166
Good Mr. Lu

19
00:00:33.466 --> 00:00:34.666
I will definitely contact you.

20
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:35.900
I'll go first then.

21
00:00:36.766 --> 00:00:39.300
Just take advantage of today's stage

22
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.066
Open my Lu Yao's name

23
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:42.500
listen

24
00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:44.700
This occasion

25
00:00:45.266 --> 00:00:48.100
You didn't come in, did you?

26
00:00:48.133 --> 00:00:49.300
Who am I?

27
00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:50.800
So it's my sister?

28
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.800
They have all left the Shi family

29
00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:54.766
What are you doing at this party?

30
00:00:54.766 --> 00:00:56.333
You can come

31
00:00:56.333 --> 00:00:57.400
I don't know why

32
00:00:59.533 --> 00:01:00.333
Hey

33
00:01:01.066 --> 00:01:02.266
You don't speak

34
00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.166
I thought there was no beggar.

35
00:01:05.166 --> 00:01:07.366
Hold your dirty hands
