00:00:06.666 --> 00:00:09.300
I told you I'm here to help you

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.000

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:12.866

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.900
You can follow me from now on.

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.300
You also run a factory

Not before.

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.433
But isn't this the factory on site now?

00:00:21.533 --> 00:00:23.733
What, you want to rob my factory?

00:00:23.733 --> 00:00:26.366
Hey, I'm a civilized person

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.666
I want to buy your factory

14
00:00:30.566 --> 00:00:32.000
Is there something wrong with you?

15
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.466
Look how poor you are

16
00:00:33.466 --> 00:00:34.300
Do you have any money?

17
00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.366

Do you know who Master Tiger is?

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.300
Tiger Lord is a character who penetrates the sky

24
00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.400
In Le City, he is one of the best underground heroes

25
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.700
I give at least 500,000 to Tiger every day

50 kilograms can be smashed to death. You say I will give it.

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:03.800
You buy so much money
