00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:01.366
It's okay, sister.

2
00:00:01.366 --> 00:00:04.633
This is a gift from the boss of Genting Tiangong for me at no cost.

3
00:00:04.666 --> 00:00:06.500
Xiaoyao, you cheated again.

4
00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:09.233
How could the boss give you such an expensive gift?

5
00:00:09.333 --> 00:00:12.166
Maybe Xiaoyao helped someone

6
00:00:12.166 --> 00:00:13.966
Yeah, do him a favor.

7
00:00:13.966 --> 00:00:17.233
It's normal for him to give me a villa, oops.

8
00:00:18.866 --> 00:00:19.666
Don't worry.

9
00:00:19.666 --> 00:00:21.600
I'm not the gambler I used to be

10
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:22.666
From now on

11
00:00:22.666 --> 00:00:24.166
I will keep my feet on the ground

12
00:00:24.166 --> 00:00:26.433
Let's live our best lives

13
00:00:26.733 --> 00:00:29.100
Sister, just trust Xiaoyao

14
00:00:29.133 --> 00:00:30.166
Is he now?

15
00:00:30.166 --> 00:00:31.133
Not only did you make money

16
00:00:31.133 --> 00:00:32.400
And his own business

17
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:33.933
He has really changed for the better

18
00:00:33.933 --> 00:00:36.700
Xiaoyao believes that you have changed

19
00:00:37.066 --> 00:00:39.633
Back then, all three of us were orphans

20
00:00:39.666 --> 00:00:41.833
Although there is no blood relationship

21
00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.866
But I believe that as long as we work together

22
00:00:44.866 --> 00:00:47.400
Life will definitely get better and better

23
00:00:47.866 --> 00:00:49.100
The life experience of the eldest sister and the second sister

24
00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:50.966
I didn't find out until more than ten years later

25
00:00:50.966 --> 00:00:53.400
It seems to have something to do with Zhang Jia, a wealthy family in Zhongzhou

26
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.266
I didn't expect the eldest sister to know long ago

27
00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.100
Sister, even if we are not related by blood

28
00:00:59.266 --> 00:01:01.600
She will not always be my good sister

29
00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.166
So much has happened today

30
00:01:11.166 --> 00:01:12.800
Sister is a little tired

31
00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.900
I'm going to rest first

32
00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:18.033
I'll show you our new house tomorrow
