00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:05.066
Star I was wrong

2
00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:06.700
Please forgive me.

3
00:00:06.866 --> 00:00:07.866
I was wrong.

4
00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:11.900
I can mess with you

5
00:00:14.266 --> 00:00:15.466
Dear Mr. Du

6
00:00:15.733 --> 00:00:18.266
I was wrong. I was wrong.

7
00:00:19.266 --> 00:00:21.700
Didn't you say I was a dog?

8
00:00:23.366 --> 00:00:24.366
Life is blurting out

9
00:00:24.566 --> 00:00:25.566
Life is blurting out

10
00:00:25.666 --> 00:00:26.833
I I

11
00:00:27.566 --> 00:00:30.200
Didn't you say you want me to lick the soles of your feet?

12
00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:31.966
Do you still let someone sleep with you?

13
00:00:32.166 --> 00:00:33.200
You go away

14
00:00:33.733 --> 00:00:34.533
fuck off

15
00:00:36.766 --> 00:00:37.800
late

16
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:45.033
The security takes it away, take it away, go, don't come.

17
00:00:46.566 --> 00:00:47.366
master

18
00:00:49.566 --> 00:00:52.100
Mr. Chen Legend's agency rights for this game

19
00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.266
It's you now.

20
00:00:53.266 --> 00:00:55.533
But I have an idea.

21
00:00:55.533 --> 00:00:58.066
Is this name going to be changed to a hot-blooded legend?

22
00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:00.800
OK, I'll do it right away.

23
00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:02.366
In my last life?

24
00:01:02.366 --> 00:01:03.533
I remember this Chen Bridge

25
00:01:03.533 --> 00:01:05.100
After independently winning the legendary copyright

26
00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.066
In just two years, he became the richest man in a building

27
00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:08.166
Worth hundreds of billions

28
00:01:08.166 --> 00:01:09.500
I have an assistant in my life

29
00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.433
I believe he will take off in less than two years
