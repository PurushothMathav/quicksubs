1
00:00:00.466 --> 00:00:01.266
waste

2
00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:03.466
Why don't you dare to add it?

3
00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:06.100
Master, you should take care of yourself

4
00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:08.833
Spent so much money on a big pile of junk

5
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:10.500
Oops boy

6
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.166
All these things you have today add up

7
00:00:12.166 --> 00:00:13.300
The total price is higher than me

8
00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:14.866
I will take your surname tomorrow

9
00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:17.933
Next is the highlight of this auction

10
00:00:17.933 --> 00:00:19.233
Spring and Autumn Mountains and Rivers

11
00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:23.366
Starting at 20 million.

12
00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.600
This is definitely the true episode of Spring and Autumn 13 contracts

13
00:00:26.966 --> 00:00:28.900
It's estimated at 200 million.

14
00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:29.700
Hey

15
00:00:30.166 --> 00:00:31.400
20 million

16
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.466
25 million

17
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.000
Sister, I thought you were going to give up.

18
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.966
30 million sisters

19
00:00:39.966 --> 00:00:41.666
I advise you not to struggle

20
00:00:41.733 --> 00:00:43.533
Maybe one day I will become the head of the family

21
00:00:43.533 --> 00:00:45.366
I can also leave you some thin noodles.

22
00:00:45.366 --> 00:00:46.433
then

23
00:00:46.466 --> 00:00:48.966
I can also agree with you to be with this trash

24
00:00:49.166 --> 00:00:51.366
40 million less nonsense

25
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.200
It's Mr. Tian, you usually don't care about your company

26
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:55.400
So much wasted money again

27
00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.333
I don't think you have the money to compete with me at all

28
00:00:57.333 --> 00:00:58.600
This piece of leather, right?

29
00:01:01.766 --> 00:01:03.433
Oops sister

30
00:01:03.733 --> 00:01:05.133
You guessed it right

31
00:01:05.133 --> 00:01:06.500
I really don't have any money.

32
00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.866
So what?
