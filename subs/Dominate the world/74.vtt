00:00:05.333 --> 00:00:06.366
How is that possible?

2
00:00:12.666 --> 00:00:15.166
Is the time up worthy of our players' trust?

3
00:00:15.166 --> 00:00:16.566
Refund money refund

Refund money refund

7
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.200
Ask for money

8
00:00:24.866 --> 00:00:26.466
Ask for money ask for money

9
00:00:26.733 --> 00:00:27.500
Ask for money

10
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.400
Just now I do miners impose stocks I don't want money

11
00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.833
How could it be? It's all for 10 days' salary.

12
00:00:32.966 --> 00:00:33.966
And I believe

13
00:00:33.966 --> 00:00:35.300
Your whole new world

14
00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.966
It will definitely be picked up again in my hands. Okay.

15
00:00:37.966 --> 00:00:40.200
Don't worry, I will definitely help you in the future.

16
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.466
Hey, by the way, you just contacted that Chen Qiaosheng.

17
00:00:43.466 --> 00:00:45.100
Do you need to enter the gaming industry?

18
00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:47.633
Yes, this is the settlement point, not

19
00:00:47.733 --> 00:00:49.733
On the one hand, continue to trade stocks

20
00:00:49.733 --> 00:00:51.166
Battle Wall Street

21
00:00:51.533 --> 00:00:52.466
Wall Street

22
00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:54.300
Right

23
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:55.566
In that case

24
00:00:55.566 --> 00:00:57.900
I need you to help me open another overseas house.

25
00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:59.266
Ah, okay.

26
00:00:59.266 --> 00:01:00.666
Then I'll take it for you. Hmm.

27
00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:03.600
On the other hand, it is why I met Chen Xiaosheng

28
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:04.333
I plan to

29
00:01:04.333 --> 00:01:06.700
He formed an Internet entertainment company with him

30
00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.066
Entering the Internet industry with full ownership

31
00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:10.400
Internet

32
00:01:11.133 --> 00:01:11.700
Guiyang

33
00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.166
The scale of this domestic Internet has not yet developed

34
00:01:14.166 --> 00:01:17.000
Is it riskier for you to dive in like this?

35
00:01:17.133 --> 00:01:18.700
It is precisely because it has not yet developed

36
00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:20.800
That's why we want to take advantage.

37
00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:22.733
The future speed of internet development

38
00:01:22.733 --> 00:01:24.466
It can definitely be described as taking off

39
00:01:24.533 --> 00:01:27.266
Just the size of the entire global Internet economy

40
00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.566
At least tens of trillions of dollars

41
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.700
I still think it's too risky

42
00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.100
And they're not very happy about the Internet moving forward.

43
00:01:35.366 --> 00:01:37.466
Do you think you should think again?

44
00:01:37.866 --> 00:01:41.066
Yaxi, your knowledge of the Internet is still too heavy
