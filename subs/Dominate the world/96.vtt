1
00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:01.600
Take the next road manager

2
00:00:02.466 --> 00:00:05.566
I'm going back to the shareholders' meeting now.

3
00:00:05.666 --> 00:00:07.866
Through the Jincheng contract?

4
00:00:07.866 --> 00:00:09.866
Hope we can cooperate happily.

5
00:00:09.966 --> 00:00:10.833
Then goodbye

6
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.766
Ahaha

7
00:00:15.933 --> 00:00:19.733
What about you, Mr. Lu? I have seen the unity here.

8
00:00:19.733 --> 00:00:21.966
But penguins are having a hard time.

9
00:00:21.966 --> 00:00:23.666
Why do you still choose me?

10
00:00:23.666 --> 00:00:25.366
Because I told Yahin

11
00:00:25.366 --> 00:00:27.700
We need to invest in more than just products

12
00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:29.833
More people like you

13
00:00:30.766 --> 00:00:33.033
Oh people like me right

14
00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:35.666
Someone like you can pioneer an entire era

15
00:00:35.666 --> 00:00:37.333
Boss Ma, have you ever considered

16
00:00:37.333 --> 00:00:40.166
Why Your Penguins Have Been Unprofitable

17
00:00:40.166 --> 00:00:40.966
This

18
00:00:41.733 --> 00:00:43.500
Very fast user growth

19
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.800
However, the investment is also increasing

20
00:00:45.966 --> 00:00:47.300
I wanted to sell it some time ago.

21
00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.100
But it never sold.

22
00:00:49.333 --> 00:00:51.066
Fortunately you didn't sell it.

23
00:00:51.166 --> 00:00:53.800
The entire market value of penguins in the future is simply zero

24
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.666
Estimate, think about it.

25
00:00:55.766 --> 00:00:56.333
You penguins

26
00:00:56.333 --> 00:00:58.500
The number of users is already so large

27
00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.766
But you are limited to the field of telecommunications

28
00:01:00.766 --> 00:01:03.200
Why not expand into other fields?

29
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.300
How to expand

30
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.100
Lots of entertainment

31
00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:08.466
Voice Dating

32
00:01:08.466 --> 00:01:10.500
Games, especially games

33
00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.400
I really recommend going into gaming

34
00:01:13.666 --> 00:01:15.700
While the game is being played

35
00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:18.700
Users must register through the Penguin account.

36
00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:20.533
And different

37
00:01:20.533 --> 00:01:22.533
Users can also use the Penguin account.

38
00:01:22.533 --> 00:01:25.366
Play together online with strangers

39
00:01:25.366 --> 00:01:26.200
Isn't that better?

40
00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:27.066
Mr. Zhang

41
00:01:27.266 --> 00:01:28.366
Mr. Du, continue to say

42
00:01:28.366 --> 00:01:29.866
I'll make a note here.

43
00:01:30.566 --> 00:01:33.533
Well, there are also upgrades to the penguins.

44
00:01:33.533 --> 00:01:35.466
Add paid membership feature

45
00:01:35.466 --> 00:01:37.933
Each member must have a unique membership logo

46
00:01:37.933 --> 00:01:40.533
And the associated membership benefits

47
00:01:40.533 --> 00:01:42.533
Level acceleration, for example.

48
00:01:42.533 --> 00:01:43.966
Special costumes, etc.

49
00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:44.566
In addition to that

50
00:01:44.566 --> 00:01:48.000
You can also create the user's personal space.

51
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.700
Every user can publish in the space

52
00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.200
Photos and videos

53
00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.400
And different penguins

54
00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.500
Users can also comment on each other

55
00:01:55.666 --> 00:01:59.133
It is also possible to bind special relationships between users

56
00:01:59.133 --> 00:02:02.433
For example, I particularly care about couples, lovers, etc.

57
00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.100
Capture the young market

58
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.666
Okay, that's all for now

59
00:02:06.666 --> 00:02:08.300
If there are any other questions in the future

60
00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:09.666
You can come to me anytime.

61
00:02:09.866 --> 00:02:12.033
Mr. Du, you are really a god
