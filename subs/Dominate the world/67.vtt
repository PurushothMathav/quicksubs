00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:04.066
Lu Xiaoyong is the distinguished guest I asked Yaxian to invite

2
00:00:04.066 --> 00:00:05.733
As soon as you say blast it out, blast it out

3
00:00:05.733 --> 00:00:07.133
Do you still have me in your eyes?

4
00:00:07.133 --> 00:00:08.066
Lu Xiaoyong

5
00:00:08.066 --> 00:00:09.366
Excuse me?

6
00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:10.466
inside

7
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.866
Don't take it to heart if you are not sensible

8
00:00:12.866 --> 00:00:15.366
It's okay, I'm Yaxian's boyfriend

9
00:00:15.366 --> 00:00:16.766
Just call me Xiao Liu

10
00:00:17.966 --> 00:00:18.766
Xiao Yang

11
00:00:19.533 --> 00:00:21.100
Come on, don't ask.

12
00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:26.166
This is a foreign wine my son brought from Germany

13
00:00:26.166 --> 00:00:27.933
It is dedicated to the master

14
00:00:27.933 --> 00:00:29.400
Cheap for you today, brother.

15
00:00:30.066 --> 00:00:31.966
Sister-in-law heard that you like fine wine

16
00:00:31.966 --> 00:00:33.200
My girlfriend in Shaoxing

17
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.100
Brought me a bottle of their specialty

18
00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:37.600
I brought it over today so you could try it.

19
00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:38.866
Hope you like it.

20
00:00:38.866 --> 00:00:42.033
Good wine with heroes

21
00:00:42.166 --> 00:00:44.833
I must have a few more drinks today

22
00:00:46.133 --> 00:00:46.933
Ah!

23
00:00:47.066 --> 00:00:49.366
Look what I have in this broken jar

24
00:00:49.366 --> 00:00:51.633
Who knows how he got fat?

25
00:00:54.566 --> 00:00:56.566
Sir, don't move

26
00:01:02.933 --> 00:01:04.600
You prodigal bitch

27
00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.366
Do you know what you sprinkled this on?

28
00:01:07.533 --> 00:01:09.266
Licking the sky

29
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.800
Isn't it just inferior Baijiu?

30
00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:12.500
cut

31
00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.466
The bottle is dirty and has mud on it, you know what the hell

32
00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.866
This is the period of the Republic of China

33
00:01:17.866 --> 00:01:19.766
Big families are buried in the ground

34
00:01:19.766 --> 00:01:21.300
When my daughter gets married

35
00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:24.900
The first-class daughter red that was dug out and opened.

36
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.400
valuable but powerless

37
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.266
Priceless?

38
00:01:28.366 --> 00:01:31.600
Remember when I was a kid I stole a sip

39
00:01:31.666 --> 00:01:36.666
I was chased three blocks by my grandfather with a cane

40
00:01:37.366 --> 00:01:39.400
You sprinkled so much today.

41
00:01:39.733 --> 00:01:41.333
I have the heart to kill you now

42
00:01:41.333 --> 00:01:44.300
Besides, there is a priceless wine that can be indulged in heaven, okay?

43
00:01:45.666 --> 00:01:47.166
I'm just pretending to be confused

44
00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:48.633
Not dead
