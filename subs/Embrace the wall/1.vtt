00:00:02.466 --> 00:00:03.466
See Commander

2
00:00:05.666 --> 00:00:07.500
What's the business?

3
00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.666
The Japanese Navy seeks to purchase a giant air ship

4
00:00:09.666 --> 00:00:10.600
Bid 50 billion

5
00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:11.766
Five-star general Asi

6
00:00:11.766 --> 00:00:14.100
Buying and New Year's Day are willing to offset half of the country

7
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:16.733
Now that the war broke out, they were finally in a hurry

8
00:00:16.733 --> 00:00:18.200
Tell them that business can be negotiated

9
00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.066
Gotta pay

10
00:00:20.066 --> 00:00:22.700
It's not good, it's not good, it's not good.

11
00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:23.466
Commander

12
00:00:23.466 --> 00:00:25.900
The unidentified object of the business bureau called us

13
00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:26.866
Is a super missile

14
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:28.733
Trick-or-treating is never so fast

15
00:00:28.733 --> 00:00:30.700
There is only one possibility that he has come

16
00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:32.000
King of Blood Jade

17
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.233
He has the most terrifying assassination organization in the world

18
00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:35.800
And so what do we do?

19
00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:39.233
What to be afraid of is just an organization living in legend

20
00:00:39.366 --> 00:00:40.566
Pass my order

21
00:00:40.666 --> 00:00:42.800
Concentrate your firepower to crush the blood jade

22
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:44.300
Yes

23
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.900
Super powerful

24
00:00:49.333 --> 00:00:52.266
Fight kill

25
00:00:53.366 --> 00:00:54.166
Ouch.

26
00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:03.633
Ahhh

27
00:01:06.266 --> 00:01:07.566
Uh-huh.

28
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:12.800
Ah!

29
00:01:14.366 --> 00:01:15.233
Ah!

30
00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.700
Lin Fan

31
00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.900
Do you know what will happen if you offend my pavilion king?

32
00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.366
Then I don't care.

33
00:01:35.366 --> 00:01:36.866
You can offend me Lin Fan

34
00:01:36.933 --> 00:01:38.400
One end

35
00:01:38.766 --> 00:01:39.666
Oh, dear.

36
00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:42.633
Oh, dear.
