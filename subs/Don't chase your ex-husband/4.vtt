00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.180
What are you crazy about when it rains?

2
00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:03.980
I think you are dirty.

3
00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:09.380
After all, this is also the intention of Brother God's will

4
00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.980
Why don't you know that you feel sorry for your brother?

5
00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:14.820
Did you see it?

6
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.900
This is a sensible woman

7
00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:18.200
Can you learn?

8
00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.660
Don't be so feminine all day long

9
00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.780
Unreasonable walk

10
00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:34.460
You can make me bigger.

11
00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:37.200
Can you stop following me?

12
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.380
I also need my own personal space

13
00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:43.340
Don't be narcissistic, I'm going back to rest and eat noodles.

14
00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.780
Where were you sent to listen to the words of the police?

15
00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:51.140
Nothing to do with me

16
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.620
Ah, dear.

17
00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:00.340
It hurts, let me see

18
00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:05.180
Brother God, I can't go

19
00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.040
Wrapped ankle sprained

20
00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.180
I'm going to start sending him

21
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.460
Go by yourself.

22
00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.420
Brother providence, be gentle

23
00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:32.740
You're hurting me.

24
00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:33.940
What about celery?

25
00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:36.500
It doesn't hurt anymore

26
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.060
Mr. Bai

27
00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.860
It was God's will that brother had to press it for me

28
00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:49.780
I don't want to either.

29
00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.020
Oh, why are you still wearing the lab clothes?

30
00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:59.500
I don't know if Brother God will feel sick when he smells the medicine?

31
00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.300
This is my house.

32
00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.700
What does it matter to you what I wear?

33
00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:06.460
Chen Tianyi

34
00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:09.520
I came back with the smell of medicine, you find it disgusting

35
00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.100
You put medicine on his feet and you won't feel nauseous

36
00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.680
Hey, Fang Yu, why are you so small?

37
00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:17.880
Cha Cha is my excellent employee

38
00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.580
He gave me 200 million investment

39
00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.620
What's wrong with me as the boss taking care of him?

40
00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.100
Ah, I'd like to ask you

41
00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.480
What does my husband and my career mean to you?

42
00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.740
Then you let him wear my clothes and live in my house, what am I to you?

43
00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.460
Cha Cha went home for work

44
00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.340
The company has developed well, can't you wear gold and silver?

45
00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.460
Forget it, so you give him the master bedroom on the second floor

46
00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:48.860
You go to the first floor, it's me

47
00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:52.340
So you two are out of sight and out of mind, right?
