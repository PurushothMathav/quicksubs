00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.220
It seems that some people don't even have a chance to be handmaids

2
00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.380
Gray hair is enough for you

3
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.860
You're just a little employee messing around

4
00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.100
If it weren't for Brother Providence arranging you into the company

5
00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:14.440
You're not even a fart

6
00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:17.500
Brother Providence has given you a chance to perform

7
00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:20.120
I can't catch it, what are you still pretending to be here?

8
00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:23.120
You deliberately sabotaged the investment against Brother Providence

9
00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:25.900
Don't you just want to show your importance?

10
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.180
I'll tell you what.

11
00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:29.380
In the eyes of God's will

12
00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:31.580
You are nothing

13
00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.360
I was planning the cosmeceutical research and development from start to finish.

14
00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:38.900
I make prescriptions by myself

15
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:40.620
I need him to give me steps

16
00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:42.560
What are you?

17
00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:43.360
you

18
00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:47.540
You also dare to call me Tianyi Guoge in front of me

19
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.140
Just because he is my good assistant

20
00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.660
As long as I want

21
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.060
He is the lady boss

22
00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.520
Mr. Chen, what do you mean by this sentence?

23
00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:00.260
Can I give you an explanation?

24
00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:02.420
And here's what I mean.

25
00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.180
Come down and check it out right now and apologize

26
00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:08.980
Otherwise we will divorce

27
00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.060
Don't get a penny.

28
00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:13.860
Stop! Aah!

29
00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:16.680
Miss Bai first

30
00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.060
Do you have anything to respond to Mr. Chen's words?

31
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.700
And here's my response.

32
00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:22.560
Mrs. Zhou is here

33
00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.660
Mrs. Li is here

34
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:26.860
divestment
