00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:03.260
Ladies please see

2
00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.860
This is your latest product development

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.560
Oh my god

4
00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:13.620
I didn't expect to be able to develop the best cosmeceuticals in such a simple laboratory

5
00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:16.780
I used to want to have a private laboratory.

6
00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.760
Chen Tianyi said I was just a small formula room

7
00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:21.200
There is no need to waste so much money.

8
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.440
So I found such a place to make do

9
00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:24.820
This is the latest product.

10
00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.100
I named it Honey Talk.

11
00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:32.360
There will be a new product launch conference for him in a few days.

12
00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.540
OK, then we'll wait for your new product launch.

13
00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.740
Check out the top formulator you mentioned

14
00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:43.140
It's in places like this.

15
00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:45.380
Oh master

16
00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.960
The personality is a little weird, I can check it out.

17
00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.440
But if the wordy master can't help us

18
00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.060
No one can help us

19
00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.260
It makes sense to go

20
00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:00.940
Bai Fangyu, what are you doing here?

21
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.080
It must be a big talk

22
00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:04.880
It's time to ask Master Luce for help

23
00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:06.560
But look at this

24
00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.340
You seem to have been kicked out.

25
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.840
Did Mei Fangyu see it?

26
00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.220
Without me, you are nothing

27
00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:15.920
Even if you ask for help, you will be turned away.

28
00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.180
I'm taking care of my own business

29
00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.480
Don't ask for anything

30
00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:20.820
You also have a career

31
00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:26.060
Are you still pulling investments in the name of my providence brother?

32
00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:27.700
You are already divorced

33
00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:29.520
Can you learn to walk independently?

34
00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.900
No, I have no way to complain to you.

35
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.100
Who said no?

36
00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:34.880
So master

37
00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:36.240
Our boss wants to invest in you.

38
00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.620
This is the investment proposal.
