00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:02.280
How can there be no words?

2
00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.900
What's the matter, keep talking?

3
00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.840
Yes, aren't you the master planner?

4
00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:08.900
Speak

5
00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:10.280
Ah!

6
00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:13.840
Yes

7
00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.140
Is it right?

8
00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:28.300
Mainly analysis

9
00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.740
No, I don't know the reaction of sodium sulfate and calcium carbonate.

10
00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:38.960
Do you think there is a possibility?

11
00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.180
He doesn't even know what biological cosmeceutical is

12
00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.220
Miss Tea, can I ask you a question?

13
00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.780
Our products can be said to be food nail art.

14
00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.600
And there are no side effects that can be said of food for young children

15
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:50.760
Excuse me, Miss Tea.

16
00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.580
We understand that before your company canned drug molecules in tin bottles for cooling.

17
00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.980
But now why is it changed to lyophilized powder?

18
00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:05.540
Freeze-drying technology

19
00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.900
It is a lyophilized powder preservation technology

20
00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:09.520
Excuse me, Miss Tea.

21
00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.180
Our company's latest biological cosmeceutical

22
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.420
Were they made from living cells or from microbes?

23
00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:18.120
Ah.

24
00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.580
I think it should be

25
00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.440
Miss Microbial Fork

26
00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:25.580
well known

27
00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:29.520
The fused skin cells cannot grow for a long time in HGPRT

28
00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.780
How did you solve this problem?

29
00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.560
Ladies and gentlemen, Meicha just put forward a research and development idea

30
00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.940
The specific product details also need to be explained by Bai Fangyu

31
00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:43.980
Bai Fangyu, continue to speak

32
00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:45.660
Oh no.

33
00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.100
Zhang Meicha is the company's mobilization

34
00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:51.520
Introduce products to so many customers every day

35
00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.100
It should be the same as the basic recipe

36
00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.820
And he's the mastermind

37
00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.460
I have no value for details

38
00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.260
What if I make a mistake and delay the investment?

39
00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.860
Or let the professional big business look at it

40
00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.500
You are a big business and a master planner

41
00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:11.180
Don't you know the product formula?

42
00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.280
Didn't you make this PPT yourself?

43
00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:14.740
You keep talking

44
00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.580
Or do you know nothing at all?

45
00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.380
He's deceiving us.
