00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.620
It's not Chinese New Year yet, don't be so smart

2
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:17.120
See grandpa can't give you money, why are you in the crown prince's car?

3
00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:20.900
Hey Haoyu, I didn't expect you to bump into such a ground in order to attract me

4
00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:23.420
I advise you.

5
00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:24.900
Better not be far enough away from me

6
00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.300
I can still look down on you in front of the prince

7
00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.740
What you wrote to my investors today

8
00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.060
Invest in you

9
00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:40.640
You pretended to be Master Ru Shui and dare to deceive the Crown Prince

10
00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.860
Chen Tianyi, you can't see my skills, some people can see it

11
00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:46.620
Don't waste time

12
00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.080
This kind of group gathers industry elites

13
00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:52.560
The Crown Prince has a lofty status that no one can shake

14
00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:55.620
Incompetent people like you pretend to be water masters

15
00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.460
This will be pierced very quickly

16
00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:58.700
When is the time?

17
00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:00.600
It's suicidal.

18
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.260
What's it to you that I'm killing myself?

19
00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:08.480
Could it be that Mr. Chen, you don't forget my old love?

20
00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:11.460
Then how sad is your Miss Chacha?

21
00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.000
As soon as you walk in, there will be identification

22
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.440
Once you find out that you are impersonating

23
00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:19.760
I'm afraid the Crown Prince will be angry with us because of our relationship

24
00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:21.120
What is our relationship?

25
00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:22.320
We're divorced.

26
00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.380
Stop fighting and go

27
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.480
Yo, why don't you go in?

28
00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:30.980
Afraid of being punctured

29
00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:32.660
I'm waiting for someone to grab it.

30
00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:35.760
Typhoon rain

31
00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:38.760
I didn't expect it to become more and more impractical after you left me

32
00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:40.200
Who are you?

33
00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.020
Someone will come to pick you up

34
00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:44.040
If someone really comes to invite you

35
00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.660
I learned to bark the dog on the spot hahaha
