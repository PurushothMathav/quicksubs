1
00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:17.840
Mr. Bai looks at me

2
00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:20.180
I'm going to give birth to a monkey for you.

3
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:21.800
Is this really Mr. Bai?

4
00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:22.840
So pretty

5
00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:26.420
It's so beautiful, it's a beauty god

6
00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:28.860
Brother Providence

7
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.700
Sister Fang Yu didn't come back last night

8
00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:35.180
If I were your wife, I wouldn't dare to stay home late at night

9
00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.340
Why did I marry such an ignorant woman in the first place?

10
00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.020
Mr. Chen, Mrs. Zhou and Mrs. Li are coming soon

11
00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:45.840
I'm going to introduce new products to the two wives today.

12
00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.240
Why hasn't Sister Fang Yu come yet?

13
00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.520
What does it matter if Eta comes or not?

14
00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:53.340
Your new product is just a random addition to last year's product.

15
00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.080
Don't talk like it can decide the life and death of the company

16
00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:59.740
Don't forget that Brother Tianyi is the boss of the company.

17
00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.860
Then don't forget that the two wives are going to invest in a new product researched by Sister Fang Yu

18
00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:07.020
Okay, I want someone to find it.

19
00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:08.660
Lai Fangyu

20
00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:10.040
I will criticize it tomorrow.

21
00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:11.460
Don't wait for tomorrow.

22
00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:15.780
Bai Fangyu

23
00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.240
Did you know that you are still working?

24
00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.220
I said a few words to you yesterday, and you will know how to be the president's wife if you are so lazy.

25
00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.820
And you don't have to dress like Cha-cha to please me

26
00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:34.740
You look like a clown, you know?

27
00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:36.660
Phoenix

28
00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:38.960
Never need to imitate

29
00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:40.780
Pheasant, who do you think it is, Mr. Chen?

30
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.700
The two ladies have arrived

31
00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.420
What about the new product plan of Southern Moon?

32
00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:48.760
Didn't I ask you to print 20 copies?

33
00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:50.180
Why just print one?

34
00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:52.660
What do you show people?

35
00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.560
Remember today is a big day for the company

36
00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.200
Without investment, the capital chain will break

37
00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.500
Can you have some snacks?

38
00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:01.540
No one told me to print

39
00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:03.940
I said in the group

40
00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:06.280
group

41
00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.160
Ah, I'm sorry.

42
00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.500
I forgot to pull my sister into the inner group.

43
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.220
Quit

44
00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:18.500
But it didn't matter.

45
00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.340
I quit my job
