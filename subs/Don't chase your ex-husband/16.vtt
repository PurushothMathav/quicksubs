00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:01.240
In less than a day

2
00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:03.580
All customers will cancel the cooperation.

3
00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:09.460
White Wind and Rain

4
00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:15.420
Bai Feng immediately chased the two wives back to me

5
00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:17.520
I can let you go for stealing company secrets

6
00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.260
I can still keep you by my side

7
00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:21.940
Don't blame me for being heartless

8
00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.540
Chen Tianyi, you and I are never on the same level

9
00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.880
You'd rather have time to talk to me here

10
00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.420
It's better to reuse employees who really bring value to the company

11
00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:34.620
Just trying to fight me

12
00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:37.180
It will only become a joke to you

13
00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.260
He was helpless

14
00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:42.840
If you hadn't been soft-hearted to take him in

15
00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.040
He could be a formulator.

16
00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.420
Do you know any investors?

17
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.060
What are you looking for them for?

18
00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.500
Did the company raise you just to let you chat?

19
00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:58.880
It's break time now.

20
00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.760
A herd of cattle and horses depends on me to raise them all

21
00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.140
You deserve a break.

22
00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:05.900
Everyone works overtime all night

23
00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:07.900
Otherwise, why do you get a penny?

24
00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:13.880
Brother Providence

25
00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:15.600
Don't be angry.

26
00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.120
I have already sent someone to hire the most powerful formulator.

27
00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:22.300
Soon our company will be taken to the next level

28
00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:27.340
At that time, the white square fish will definitely kneel on the ground and beg your forgiveness.

29
00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:29.500
As long as he is willing to kneel for me

30
00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.540
Can you forgive him?

31
00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:35.700
Brother God's will, what about me?

32
00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:40.820
Who let you in?

33
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Hello Mr. Chen

34
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.480
I am the lawyer of the Great Wall Green President

35
00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:48.620
My name is Ace, and Miss Wang is entrusted to handle the divorce ceremony.

36
00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:50.160
This is the divorce agreement

37
00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:51.660
If there is no problem

38
00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:53.060
Sign there
