1
00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:01.120
What!

2
00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:05.980
You said that you said that these things depend on the synthesis of Bai Fang and Chen, right?

3
00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:09.280
Bai Fang was only arranged by Brother God's will to come in and fish

4
00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:10.340
What's the technology?

5
00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.660
I think you guys were bribed by him.

6
00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.060
Deliberately not synthesizing the formula

7
00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:16.840
You are all employees of the company

8
00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:19.120
What good does it do you when the company collapses?

9
00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:21.780
Bai is always the world's top formulator

10
00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.560
His cosmeceutical formula is the treasure that countless rich wives want

11
00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.280
None of us here can compare to him

12
00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:29.740
Okay, you can't even compare to a piece of trash

13
00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.180
What's the use of keeping you

14
00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:33.700
You are here to cheat 3 times the salary, right?

15
00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.900
Brother Providence, hurry up and drive them all away

16
00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.060
I don't believe it.

17
00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:41.300
How can I believe that he is the only formulator in the world?

18
00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:43.020
You losers

19
00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.620
Don't come with me from tomorrow

20
00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:48.220
Are you all right?

21
00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.000
Our resignation letter is already on the desk

22
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.540
Now you're begging us to do something

23
00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:57.020
We used to work overtime day and night in the company

24
00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.060
All the credit goes to green tea

25
00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:03.240
A boss like you can't be compared to Mr. Bai at all

26
00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:06.360
And we are brought by Mr. Bai himself.

27
00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.260
Where to go is not an annual salary of millions

28
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.420
Who looks down on rubbish like you?

29
00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.740
Now that the money is broken, you just wait for it to go bankrupt

30
00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:16.300
Family let's go

31
00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.080
Take the trash boss, believe green tea, don't believe us

32
00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:22.720
Not worthy of us leaving

33
00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:24.980
Roll roll roll

34
00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:26.820
A group of flies
