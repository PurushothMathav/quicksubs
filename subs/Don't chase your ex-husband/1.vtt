1
00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:26.300
I must serve Miss Bai well tonight

2
00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:28.720
Get the latest product he developed

3
00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:30.280
And we're rich.

4
00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:34.900
It's this old fox who wants to be with me

5
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.020
Fortunately, I'm better

6
00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:39.820
Find two to go

7
00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:41.640
Yeah.

8
00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:43.940
Isn't this Mrs. Zhou?

9
00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.480
Miss Bai has just developed a new cosmeceutical makeup

10
00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:47.800
There you are.

11
00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.700
It seems that this project is a must-win

12
00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:52.080
Isn't it the same when you're tired?

13
00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:55.600
Mrs. Li, I am going to invest 100 million this time.

14
00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.120
Don't rob me again, hahaha.

15
00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:59.380
So did I.

16
00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.940
Then we are mutually beneficial and win-win.

17
00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:17.660
White total biological ointment does not coagulate

18
00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.480
Sepp is wrong

19
00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:40.740
Add No. 6 essence

20
00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.940
The separation of bioactive molecules from the fermentation broth

21
00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:44.820
Then purify

22
00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:47.620
Yes, Mr. Bai, you are amazing

23
00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.220
Xiaoxiao, help me watch

24
00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:53.660
I'm going to take some medicine

25
00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:55.720
You may not have done it again.

26
00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:57.280
Ruined this new product

27
00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:58.820
You didn't eat well

28
00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.440
Mr. Chen knew that he was on a business trip with Zhang Meicha without making a phone call

29
00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.760
God's will is sometimes busy with work for the group

30
00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:07.100
Watching TV too

31
00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.700
Miss, it's time to take medicine

32
00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.460
Ah I go

33
00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.340
Do you want me to feed you?

34
00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.220
Who are you?

35
00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.760
Miss Bai, what if you are not satisfied with your sisters?

36
00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.900
I've got a better one.

37
00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.500
Ah, stop, stop, stop.

38
00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:47.180
Mrs. Zhou

39
00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.980
Mrs. Lee

40
00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.980
What are you doing here?

41
00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:53.560
Oh, Miss Bai

42
00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.540
Of course, it is still a matter of investment in new projects

43
00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:01.480
Yes, I used the last moisturizer I developed for less than a month.

44
00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.300
I feel like I'm a decade younger

45
00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.940
My husband goes to nightclubs less often

46
00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:10.580
New products that have not been developed for amputation must be pressed on our head.

47
00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:12.060
Let me eat first

48
00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:17.100
Miss Bai, what you are investing in is

49
00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.460
Sister, it's our turn, right?

50
00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:26.660
Yeah, okay, okay, I promise you.

51
00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.080
New products for you to invest in

52
00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:31.100
Hahaha come come come

53
00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:36.540
Take medicine, I will send Weibo to celebrate the successful investment, then I will prepare for the investment meeting.

54
00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:38.320
Tomorrow you have to come to the scene to sign in person

55
00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:40.860
Yes, my husband will marry her

56
00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:44.140
He can also call the company, but this and that can't be done.

57
00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.200
We're looking at you, not this company

58
00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.860
Who doesn't know that you are the pillar of Jiaen Group?

59
00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:57.260
I'll try it out.

60
00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:01.540
Hahaha, you are so kind, then we'll go. We'll go first.

61
00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.860
Hey wait, take your people away with you

62
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.840
They can serve you.

63
00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:12.980
I'm busy, okay, let's go

64
00:04:21.119 --> 00:04:23.780
How is Xiaojia's sample doing?

65
00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:27.820
The sample is done.

66
00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:29.780
Some people have lost their character

67
00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:32.540
What's the matter, Mr. Bai?

68
00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:34.660
Are you green?

69
00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:37.140
The investment of the two wives has just been confirmed

70
00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:38.720
Mr. Shen held a press conference

71
00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:40.440
Publicly show love to Zhang Meicha

72
00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:42.140
And bought him a big diamond ring
