00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:02.200
You are talking nonsense

2
00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:03.240
You framed me

3
00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:08.160
Mr. Chen, this is the truest look of your green tea sister.

4
00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.280
To tell you the truth, he sold his body to cheat investments for so many years

5
00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:14.700
In fact, I have already contracted a dirty disease.

6
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.220
You have a disease

7
00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.420
Bitch, how dare you hurt me

8
00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.600
You have to take the bait yourself?

9
00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:31.440
You have a wife who can't control your lower body?

10
00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:34.660
I'll tell you the truth. Why is your company in the red?

11
00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.880
It's because I transferred assets

12
00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:41.380
White fall, white wind and rain day and night to study the formula for you and make money for you

13
00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:43.380
Too bad you are blind

14
00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.100
I have to divorce him

15
00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.820
Now nothing.

16
00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.880
It's always because you're stupid

17
00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:51.020
You deserve it, haha.

18
00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.060
Oh, come on.

19
00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.300
Wife wife sorry

20
00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.460
It is my ignorance that makes the greatest contribution

21
00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:08.400
Wife, wife, do I think you are ignoring me?

22
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.260
Wife don't touch

23
00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:12.180
My heart

24
00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:14.700
Do you love me the most?

25
00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.100
Who am I going home with?

26
00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.540
Wife, wife, look at my wife, look at my wife, I listen to you the most, why is my wife ignoring me?

27
00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:24.020
When we were together

28
00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:25.460
You say you want to start a business

29
00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:27.880
I take into account your self-esteem

30
00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:30.500
So you are everything I don't like

31
00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:34.980
I Love You

32
00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.140
How did you ruin me?

33
00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:54.620
Then you don't want me to leave

34
00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:02.380
You wait for me you wait for me

35
00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.420
Senior sister wishes us a better life in the future
