00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.880
Or do you know nothing at all?

2
00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:04.580
He's deceiving us.

3
00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:07.520
Didn't you say he was a good assistant?

4
00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:08.760
Why don't you know anything?

5
00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.620
Could it be that he is also pretending to be virtuous?

6
00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.560
Guys, you misunderstood and checked

7
00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.620
He was framed by Bai Fangyu

8
00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.680
Bai Fangyu, I'll give Cha a chance to exercise

9
00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:23.900
You can't be better than you because of it.

10
00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:25.860
This Xiaoming Airport has been changed to be a dog, right?

11
00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:27.880
Since you dare to cover up the manuscript because of jealousy

12
00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:29.660
Your woman is too fake and poisonous

13
00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:31.820
That is, you have to apologize to Chacha

14
00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:33.920
Madam Quan, have you revised the cover-up draft?

15
00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:35.300
Excuse me.

16
00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:37.660
Please call me Miss Bai

17
00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:38.840
In addition

18
00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.300
Mr. Chen's PowerPoint has always been like this

19
00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.420
I don't know what to do in advance now.

20
00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:50.220
No, this master planner can't see the presentation

21
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:52.300
May I ask Mr. Chen?

22
00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:55.140
Is Miss Tea really the main planner of this project?

23
00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:58.580
Of course, it's just that some employees are extremely

24
00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.620
Extreme Chacha is better than him

25
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.680
So I deliberately dug a hole for him

26
00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.760
Then you can let your check explain ASAP.

27
00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:08.460
Since he is the mastermind

28
00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.660
Even if you don't understand PowerPoint

29
00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:13.980
You should also know the specific content of the project

30
00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.240
It's not that I don't tell you

31
00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.780
It's because this investment was held specially for two wives

32
00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.940
I don't want to mess around here because some people have quit their jobs

33
00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:31.180
So I'll invite everyone to go to the spa later.

34
00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.020
By the way, experience our company's new products

35
00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.780
Ladies, I'll give you a massage myself

36
00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.600
Oh, if someone wants to be cheeky

37
00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:49.740
Why don't you make a foot wash arm to wash the feet of the guests?

38
00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.180
I'm not like some people

39
00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:56.540
I'm not interested in chopping it up and giving it to others as a coin

40
00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:59.360
I won't go if Miss Bai doesn't go

41
00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:00.580
I'm not going either

42
00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:06.580
It seems that some people don't even have a chance to be handmaids
