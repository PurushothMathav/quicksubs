00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:03.560
Okay, go from here

2
00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:06.020
No suggestion. Go away.

3
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.560
Most of the other children were with their mother.

4
00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.080
Why should my parents let go?

5
00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:21.160
Bye. Leave it to you.

6
00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:22.720
Mom is not leaving today.

7
00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:24.660
Ah, I want to say goodbye.

8
00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.440
Mom, sleep with me.

9
00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:34.510
If you don't come out for a moment, I'll draw it for you.

10
00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:48.890
What happened? What was the last thing to say?

11
00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.260
Do you hate me?

12
00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.090
Why and when did you say it?

13
00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:02.570
I just feel like you will be very similar to the beginning?

14
00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:10.440
During the process, although I don’t like to distribute games.

15
00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:14.410
I have a saying that is true. The story is

16
00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.270
Our three inner questions

17
00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:19.330
In fact, how can you even get friends on board?

18
00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:21.390
I told you too

19
00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:25.080
I don't want you to feel guilty and unhappy

20
00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:29.460
There is no need to practice regularly

21
00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.720
You don’t have to let you be in front of me

22
00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.460
Become a fan of yours

23
00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:35.730
what kind of person are you

24
00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:40.010
I don't care about habits

25
00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:42.790
I don't deny what you said

26
00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:45.970
You don't like me

27
00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:48.960
But there is something you said wrong
