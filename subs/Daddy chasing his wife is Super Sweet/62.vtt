00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:04.850
What are you doing here?

2
00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:08.250
I think we will get married in the future.

3
00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:10.130
I came to see you in Tianjin.

4
00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.110
If you have anything to do, say nothing and go out. I'm very cold.

5
00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:16.379
I'm going to take care of you today.

6
00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:18.610
But he doesn’t stop and doesn’t take care of me,

7
00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:21.250
And said I was a bad person.

8
00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:23.350
You are very sincere, and you are still not close to him.

9
00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.420
But if you push me, it’s not your child.

10
00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.640
And his biological mother has been found.

11
00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.340
What else do you want him to do?

12
00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.560
If you really like children, we can have them too.

13
00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:42.830
Do you still remember?

14
00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:43.390
What day?

15
00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:45.330
that day five years ago

16
00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:47.250
that thing

17
00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.210
Haven't you already asked?

18
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:52.720
I can no longer be sure of the past

19
00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:54.990
Are you guilty?

20
00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:58.280
Then you ask

21
00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:01.670
I was tricked into that matter

22
00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:02.790
But I remember clearly

23
00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.599
This is my advanced room

24
00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:07.410
Then you come in again

25
00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:21.320
I I walked to the room real

26
00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.440
It's been so long since this happened

27
00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:24.840
I have already forgotten

28
00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:26.400
I just remember

29
00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.140
After I remember the room

30
00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.070
we we're like that

31
00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.520
Later I was too scared

32
00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:33.300
I'll leave

33
00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.540
You don’t talk about what happened that day

34
00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:44.880
Can’t quite remember the background

35
00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:47.180
Can't change

36
00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:51.980
Maybe I miscalculated

37
00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:54.180
It's not him at all
