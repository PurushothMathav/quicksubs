00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:03.640
Who is his biological father?

2
00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:05.710
Who is the father?

3
00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:07.930
What does it have to do with who you are in the world?

4
00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.170
How come it doesn’t necessarily mean success?

5
00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:12.570
I asked this for you at the time

12
00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:11.600
Bring it here? You didn’t say I was tired when you came.

13
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.220
Then go and rest

14
00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.860
Just call me and tell me what you want. I understand.

15
00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:31.550
This mechanism is

16
00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:34.300
Forget it, no matter what

17
00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:36.000
I must take you out of the mud
