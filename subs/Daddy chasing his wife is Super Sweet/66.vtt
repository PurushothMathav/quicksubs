00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:03.370
Is it because of the children or because of the danger of fighting?

2
00:00:04.059 --> 00:00:05.840
If you want a child to live by your side

3
00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:06.740
I can help you

4
00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:08.260
Donâ€™t you want me to take care of you?

5
00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:10.200
Trust me, I think I can help you find it

6
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.770
What is your identity?

7
00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:16.379
What qualifications do you have to say help me?

8
00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:17.600
I've made it very clear to you

9
00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:19.380
This thing between you and me

10
00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.360
I already explained it in my official version

11
00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:24.620
Discover everything without your help

12
00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:26.800
Don't measure me

13
00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.600
Is it because of the things I put in your way?

14
00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.420
Can be placed on my sister

15
00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.140
You didn't understand me at the time

16
00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:35.180
I feel like you are not because of what happened before

17
00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:36.380
If it weren't for the vacancies

18
00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:37.880
We won't know each other at all

19
00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:38.960
Not happy after all

20
00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:40.940
It's just a matter of emotion

21
00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:42.580
I am you like me

22
00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:43.720
You may not like me

23
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.440
Why don't you save our court?

24
00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:48.580
Don't give me another chance
