00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:02.290
The story is now my call.

2
00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:03.990
After you come and go.

3
00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:06.370
This family is getting bigger and bigger.

4
00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:10.790
This is the person you've been looking for for five years.

5
00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:12.030
This is good, I believe it.

6
00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:18.630
Oops, what are you looking for?

7
00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:20.760
Just for such a person,

8
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.160
You've been waiting for five years.

9
00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.970
This is my business, I will give you the relationship.

10
00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:29.250
Okay, let's talk about something related to the story.

11
00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.050
I heard that my little war lord’s biological daughter,

12
00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.270
You see, you hear a lot in a day.

13
00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:39.920
I'll tell you the last time.

14
00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:45.780
Don't let me hear the words "small building" from your mouth again.

15
00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.220
What are you doing here?

16
00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:50.820
When you didn't get married, you were asked to adopt that Xiaojian

17
00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.450
I don't agree with wealth.

18
00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:59.720
Mine has to be right

19
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.959
The child’s biological mother was actually found

20
00:01:04.959 --> 00:01:07.300
Let them cook soup to strengthen the family

21
00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.950
What are you talking about life girl?

22
00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:11.590
What's your attitude?

23
00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.620
I shouldn’t be handed over to you if I publish a story

24
00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:18.290
If you don’t leave the story to me, why don’t you leave it to you?

25
00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:20.070
Which female giant comes to your door?

26
00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:23.070
What kind of thing is that?

27
00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:25.480
Also put his own letter

28
00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:26.950
What story

29
00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.180
I won’t ask my own people to trust me

30
00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.100
if not for me

31
00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:33.550
Now story

32
00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:34.990
It should be called Zero Matter

33
00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:36.670
Do you think so?

34
00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:40.520
My good love is zero and one

35
00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:43.980
I warned zero times at the end

36
00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.170
Promise me to wait for you

37
00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:48.990
Only you can leave this home

38
00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.490
Without him, I would never leave my hometown.
