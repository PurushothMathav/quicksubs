1
00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:04.620
What you said is correct.

2
00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:06.550
I want to take you. You have also opened a house.

3
00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.770
Why.

4
00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:11.280
Process engineer.

5
00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.620
I know you are quite spicy.

6
00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.860
But I found you and you are nameless.

7
00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:18.220
I want to keep him by my side. I want to take good care of him.

8
00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.240
If you want to take care of him, you can stay with the Gu family.

9
00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:25.070
It must be absolutely impossible to leave. And...

10
00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:27.270
I take care of my family. You give him better things.

11
00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:30.290
I am your father.

12
00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:32.490
I have raised him for so many years.

13
00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:39.310
I don't want to be separated from him.

14
00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:41.900
It's just because of what happened to me years ago.

15
00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.540
I can't be heavy.

16
00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:50.640
Whatever you want, I can satisfy it. Not bad.

17
00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:51.060
Process engineer.

18
00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:53.100
What you call failure

19
00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.520
Plus your Guiqiao

20
00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:00.260
How long can this last for one year or three years?

21
00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:01.540
five years ten years

22
00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:03.620
But when your Guiqiao

23
00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:04.860
After it's all gone

24
00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:09.170
How do I deal with myself?

25
00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:12.880
We are not from the same world to begin with

26
00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:15.250
Five years is interpreted as something other than

27
00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:16.850
I beg you too

28
00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:18.670
I don't need you to do it

29
00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:20.830
I don’t need your fault and Guiqiao

30
00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:24.100
I think what you mean is

31
00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:27.830
I don’t want to give you any more testimony

32
00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:31.750
I just want to take you now

33
00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:33.590
You leave and live a good life

34
00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:37.710
Very big and big pointed ear locking

35
00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.890
Tomorrow I'll send you off with a white paper
