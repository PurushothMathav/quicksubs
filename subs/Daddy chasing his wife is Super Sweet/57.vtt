00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.350
Do you want to come and see you off? No need.

2
00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:08.580
You don't have to be so closed-minded to me, of course

3
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.560
There is no friendship between us

4
00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:12.450
If it weren't for that thing

5
00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:15.000
We idiots can't have any friendship, right?

6
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.980
I thought I always hated that thing too

7
00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:20.260
Maybe it's because of the dialect that I

8
00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.580
Since you are the murderer looking for dialects

9
00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:24.640
I will definitely treat you well after I come in

10
00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:27.040
time time error

11
00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:28.720
I hope you can remember it for me

12
00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:30.210
It's okay if you don't

13
00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.820
It's because I saved you

14
00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.700
Because you saved me

15
00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:38.340
Then something like this happened again

16
00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:40.400
I really hope you will remember me

17
00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:41.340
let you not once

18
00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:45.380
I don't need you if I don't owe you

19
00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:48.260
It was a coincidence that the girls lost that year

20
00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.310
I believe that anyone who wants to fight what happened back then

21
00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:52.510
I will try my best to save you

22
00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:54.160
You don't have to do it because of this

23
00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:56.020
Hurry up and please me

24
00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:57.280
Are you still blaming me?

25
00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.030
Believe me I really like your discovery

26
00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:05.489
Do you know what liking is?

27
00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:06.380
You just hurry up

28
00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:07.340
I knew you back then

29
00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:08.800
That's not like it at all

30
00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:14.190
Found that I don't need you

31
00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:15.130
I canâ€™t be grateful

32
00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.230
And I don't have any feelings for you

33
00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:21.210
Is it also for the story?
