00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.700
Kazuma waited for the Fang family to accept his grandmother.

2
00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:08.350
Make your own car,

3
00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:10.230
If you are the truth,

4
00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.550
It’s best to know clearly who you are,

5
00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.420
Know your identity clearly,

6
00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:19.340
Recognize your identity clearly, you are just a third-rate family figure,

7
00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:22.660
Send home, two people who are familiar with each other's crimes,

8
00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:24.800
Don't think about using you anymore. My hands are hungry.

9
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.720
The supply is rich, let alone the beauty that flies to our house,

10
00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:33.750
Go ahead and clean it up in the end.

11
00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.410
I don't want to give your Fang family any solution.

12
00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.520
Your Fangqie doesn't mean anything.

13
00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:40.210
If you want to put right sign contact

14
00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:42.230
The eldest lady of the Shen family next to you

15
00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:44.350
you should go find him

16
00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:45.930
instead of looking for me

17
00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:49.960
You must never dare to shoot me to death

18
00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:51.000
You've failed

19
00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:54.470
How dare you treat your elders so little? He doesn’t count.

20
00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:59.250
This is the kind of thing that happens when life speeds up

21
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.080
You want me to teach you what a gift book is?

22
00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.140
You are a waste

23
00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:07.040
I dare to stay safe here

24
00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:09.310
Not some

25
00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:12.110
When I came to participate it was not for you

26
00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.240
It's better to be more realistic

27
00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:17.870
I will apologize now or else

28
00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:19.110
I also spent a lot of time in Fengjia

29
00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.250
will not be easy

30
00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:22.230
Although when moving

31
00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:23.880
I can't change anything yet

32
00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:26.100
I'm a reasonable person

33
00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:29.470
General Shen asked me to shoot to death

34
00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:31.710
Even though you don’t know what the rules are

35
00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:33.730
But I don't visit trade trade
