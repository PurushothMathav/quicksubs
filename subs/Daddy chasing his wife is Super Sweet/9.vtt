1
00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:09.280
Then why don't you stay?

2
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.140
I'm afraid I won't find you when you wake up.

3
00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.960
Okay? Then let me come out,

4
00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:24.350
Things will be fine.

5
00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:28.130
What do you do if you know what you know?

6
00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.370
listened to him.

7
00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:33.490
Do you want to go and avenge your mother?

8
00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:35.530
I said it all.

9
00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:37.510
As long as you are obedient.

10
00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:39.340
Promise to take responsibility for the crime.

11
00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:40.880
This money will be given to the family.

12
00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:43.560
Why are you not so courageous?

13
00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.370
Not so brave. Fake screen.

14
00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.260
What qualifications do you have? Read.

15
00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:50.660
Borrow borrow borrow.

16
00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.580
How do you talk?

17
00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:54.480
Mom is doing it for your own good too

18
00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:55.590
That's your mother

19
00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:56.350
not us

20
00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.840
Why are you hurt? Boy, teach me.

21
00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.080
Why are you so poisonous?

22
00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:02.160
Don't forget that

23
00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:05.530
Your mother is still in the hospital asking for help, understand?

24
00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:06.430
you can get it wrong

25
00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:09.580
I've definitely made a mistake

26
00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:10.870
disappoint you

27
00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:17.250
But there are no million, sister

28
00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.560
Where did you get this money from?

29
00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:23.860
This is similar to the female officer Song Anren

30
00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:25.620
You'd better think about it carefully

31
00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:27.440
How to save your own life?

32
00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:29.100
What if I say

33
00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.360
I have your little building in my hands.
