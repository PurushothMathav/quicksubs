00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:03.560
Mr. Gu is Mr. Gu

2
00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:08.860
It’s already this time. I thought it would be okay without chaos.

3
00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:11.670
Now you have this why

4
00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.720
After all, we have become what we are today

5
00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:16.580
Not even possible

6
00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:20.550
If you find the child who died

7
00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.100
How could she tell the truth before the storm?

8
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.390
How could we be tortured?

9
00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:28.450
How could I be forced to do so without difficulty?

10
00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:32.950
I'm really alone when I say something like this today.

11
00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:36.600
The other person sticks to me and masturbates

12
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.030
I'll give it to you

13
00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.490
You really know your way around words and luck.

14
00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:42.840
I'd like to see

15
00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.400
Another book

16
00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:47.540
How long will it take for Qiaoyan to be lucky?

17
00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:51.020
I'll give it to you

18
00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.310
I want to make you today

19
00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:54.310
Choose between them two

20
00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:56.300
who would you choose

21
00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:01.100
you two

22
00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.300
Do you really know how to do it? Really?

23
00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:13.640
Don’t you care most about your life?

24
00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.400
As long as he sends himself to death

25
00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:19.680
Just be at peace with yourself

26
00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.040
You rush to see you off

27
00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:21.940
I stabbed

28
00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:27.520
So poisonous to death

29
00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:33.740
Would I not give you more? But you today

30
00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:35.240
I can't stay with them anymore

31
00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:39.460
It’s crazy to choose one of the middle options

32
00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.700
If something happens to him, what happens to me?
