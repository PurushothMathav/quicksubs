00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:07.260
Thank you, thank you very much.

2
00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:10.440
They were all found by the Zhao people who sent them away for illegitimacy.

3
00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:13.380
Madam, don't be angry. It's strange and you are not feeling well.

4
00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:16.800
I don’t know what some of them think.

5
00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:19.420
Have to lie down or send yourself that mountain man often.

6
00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:22.180
The separation is still happening in bed.

7
00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.860
When she arrived, she said she wanted to send an illegitimate child to commit crime.

8
00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.280
This is the most expressive.

9
00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.430
That can't be remembered. Shortly after Zhao Baiming's biological identity was confirmed.

10
00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:40.820
Zhao Yan fell into the water.

11
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.080
It's okay to start this station when the surname is ashamed.

12
00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:48.800
I remember that it was a little girl who met Zhao Baixing at that time. Remember what happened?

13
00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.600
Why didn't Perth return this disaster to Jian Si?

14
00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.480
But I have suffered so much in the Fang family

15
00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.340
I remember the little girl who rescued Mr. Shao was very sad.

16
00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:00.780
There is a trace

17
00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.700
Hey, it will be the same today

18
00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:04.440
I saw Song Citian was very sad

19
00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:05.600
There is also a trace

20
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.540
It’s nothing like the one who saved Mr. Shao back then.

21
00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:11.400
you mean

22
00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:13.420
I saved three people back then

23
00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:20.400
