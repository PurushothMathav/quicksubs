00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:06.500
Aren’t you able to catch up on the process? Why are you coming back?

2
00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:09.910
What is goude? Can you show respect?

3
00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:16.520
Respect? People like you can come in and stop!

4
00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:18.770
Do it yourself and tell you!

5
00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:20.700
Don't think you can catch the process,

6
00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.560
I'll take half of your chicken,

7
00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:24.940
If you fail, I will double it!

8
00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:27.880
It’s a good chair, but you’d better mention it,

9
00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:30.180
You can limit the amount of dust together,

10
00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.180
Otherwise, everything is fine!

11
00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:38.310
If there is a gap in rice, can you not bring me and the concern you arouse so that it can't be broken?

12
00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:40.320
Are you holding me?

13
00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:43.720
That day he came and went to treat the medicine man in front of so many people,

14
00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:44.580
for you,

15
00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:45.800
He could have taken this as a surprise

16
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.360
We all tell you our ideals

17
00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:49.080
He is your protector

18
00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:51.570
I don't understand this

19
00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:53.630
He doesn't know what a woman wants.

20
00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:55.540
This is choosing a woman

21
00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.220
It's the talent of your hand that makes it famous and loved.

22
00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:01.430
You can't just put it forward after thinking about it.

23
00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:03.290
You shouldn’t be involved in these things either.

24
00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:04.110
Just passed it

25
00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.110
He took it out of my hands

26
00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:10.160
I am very process

27
00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.700
Only broken

28
00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.420
His old sayings and artificial lawsuits

29
00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.860
And I also resigned from him.

30
00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:16.160
Follow him there from now on

31
00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:17.600
Can you die like this?
