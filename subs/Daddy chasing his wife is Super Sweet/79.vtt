00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.320
Do you think we are fools?

2
00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:07.380
Who doesn’t know that his work as Si Qing has something to do with making money during the process.

3
00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:09.970
You and he have a grudge against each other for sending Si Qing away.

4
00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:11.870
When you want to listen to me,

5
00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:13.990
Are you going to kill Si Qing? You are high and worry-free.

6
00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:17.590
Forget it, is it really small enough?

7
00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:21.130
Haha. Of course I won’t give it away.

8
00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.190
Nature will give you some benefits.

9
00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:27.540
What benefits.

10
00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:28.720
Have they all died recently?

11
00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.280
I can marry Fang Youqian.

12
00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:32.770
I will think of a way then,

13
00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:34.460
Let Fang have the money to let you go.

14
00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:35.520
Let me give you every dollar.

15
00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:36.580
As soon as we drove

16
00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:37.960
this deal

17
00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:39.280
Forget it, Caohua

18
00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:42.590
How can I trust you?

19
00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:46.890
There are 1 million in this card

20
00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:47.990
Considered a deposit

21
00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:49.090
If you don't believe it

22
00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:50.630
You can also go there

23
00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:51.970
But go down

24
00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:53.780
I can tell you

25
00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.840
You don't agree

26
00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.460
I can only help my family for the rest of my life.

27
00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.280
you helped me

28
00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.080
There's still a chance to get out of the car

29
00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:02.780
How to choose

30
00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:12.700
You promise to do it yourself

31
00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:17.780
Shall I give that to you? No need.

32
00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.490
Mom, I'm here to have dinner

33
00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.090
Later

34
00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.460
Let's just go

35
00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.280
Then time becomes incomprehensible. Bye, bye, bye.

36
00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.160
Goodbye send us off
