00:00:01.210 --> 00:00:08.380
Why are you here?

2
00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:11.580
Why are you here? I came to see you for dinner.

3
00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.680
See you later. I made it very clear to you.

4
00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:15.900
I'm done with you. There's no future.

5
00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:19.190
Now that you've sorted it out, it's gone.

6
00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:21.090
Or I would go back to the room because of the marriage experience.

7
00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:24.050
I also told you. I want to end our wedding month with you.

8
00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.390
It's impossible for me to have a holiday with you,

9
00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:29.040
I donâ€™t understand. The difference.

10
00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.600
Since our encounter is not over yet, it should be because we are interested in getting married.

11
00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.780
Do you want me to remind you how the wedding month came about?

12
00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.210
It's better to accept me.

13
00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:41.710
I told you.

14
00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:42.370
I told you. What happened between me and you,

15
00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:43.630
You have nothing to do with Gujia

16
00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:44.880
what are you doing

17
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.020
It's so lonely

18
00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.940
Is there any problem if I pick myself up and go home for my wedding?

19
00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:57.960
I have sent money

20
00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:01.580
I didn't expect you to be such an irresponsible person

21
00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:03.650
What about yourself?

22
00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:05.489
I'm not afraid of being able to protect and give my heart

23
00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:06.290
Excuse me
