00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:02.660
You sit down first and I'll cook.

2
00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:16.600
Where is the aunt at home?

3
00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.260
Every time I get too hot,

4
00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.140
It’s not my father who cooks for me. Yeah?

5
00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:26.620
I also need to be able to cook a lot of delicious food at home.

6
00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.780
My family is also very kind to me,

7
00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:31.430
real. So big!

8
00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:39.940
National affairs,

9
00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:56.600
Why are you saying this all of a sudden?

10
00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.250
What are you doing?

11
00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:00.190
Isn't it your birthday today? Let's have dinner.

12
00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:02.380
Just pretend. It’s expensive today,

13
00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:04.440
There is a father. Mother,

14
00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:06.160
After eating, we will overheat together.

15
00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:07.400
Let's shoot the heat.

16
00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:31.040
I'm happy, it's getting late

17
00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.970
Then I'll leave first

18
00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:33.870
Then I'll leave first

19
00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:36.300
If you don't go so far away, I'll go with you.
