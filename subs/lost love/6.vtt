00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:01.366
Pardon me?

2
00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:06.000
You can't joke about this kind of thing in Beijing

3
00:00:06.066 --> 00:00:07.266
I'm not kidding.

4
00:00:07.266 --> 00:00:08.600
I went to his house to play the other day.

5
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:10.200
I saw pictures of him as a child.

6
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.766
Even the clothes are shaped like the shape inside.

7
00:00:11.766 --> 00:00:12.966
Same clothes

8
00:00:13.066 --> 00:00:14.966
Are you sure very sure

9
00:00:14.966 --> 00:00:16.766
I took it with my cell phone.

10
00:00:16.766 --> 00:00:17.466
Sister Gao, wait a minute

11
00:00:17.466 --> 00:00:18.633
I'll look for it first

12
00:00:21.133 --> 00:00:23.633
Cousin, can you see if this is the same person?

13
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.833
Hey, it's him, it's really him

14
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.533
There's nowhere to find his broken iron shoes

15
00:00:30.533 --> 00:00:31.866
It's all hard work.

16
00:00:31.966 --> 00:00:33.966
Then I will find my biological daughter for Mr. Zhou

17
00:00:33.966 --> 00:00:35.666
And that's a huge achievement.

18
00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:36.466
No way.

19
00:00:36.466 --> 00:00:38.466
I have to go to the hospital and tell him the good news.

20
00:00:45.966 --> 00:00:47.366
Hello Aunt Liu

21
00:00:47.466 --> 00:00:48.500
I am one by one

22
00:00:49.466 --> 00:00:51.900
My mom's in the hospital. She needs 150,000

23
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.266
So I want to find you

24
00:00:53.966 --> 00:00:54.766
Hello

25
00:00:58.466 --> 00:00:59.833
Hello fourth aunt

26
00:00:59.866 --> 00:01:00.966
I am one by one

27
00:01:01.466 --> 00:01:02.966
That my mom needs

28
00:01:03.266 --> 00:01:06.466
150,000 hospitalization. My mom's hospitalization needs 150,000

29
00:01:06.466 --> 00:01:07.866
Uncle Zhang? Village Chief

30
00:01:07.866 --> 00:01:08.866
I am one by one.

31
00:01:08.866 --> 00:01:10.800
My mom is in the hospital. What books do you need?

32
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:11.966
100,000 Oh

33
00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:13.800
Forget it.

34
00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.000
Hey

35
00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.600
Manager Hu, is this bottle smashing grass?

36
00:01:32.666 --> 00:01:34.566
Hit a mid-term position.

37
00:01:34.566 --> 00:01:35.966
What are you doing here?

38
00:01:36.533 --> 00:01:38.633
Let's take a look at your mother

39
00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.100
This one is pale.

40
00:01:44.366 --> 00:01:46.566
If you don't have surgery soon

41
00:01:47.166 --> 00:01:48.600
I'm afraid it won't be a few days.

42
00:01:49.866 --> 00:01:51.000
You all get out

43
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.366
All of you out

44
00:01:52.966 --> 00:01:54.466
Don't worry.

45
00:01:55.666 --> 00:01:59.966
I heard that your mother's surgery costs 150,000

46
00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.233
That's a lot of money.

47
00:02:02.366 --> 00:02:05.966
Mom's almost caught up with my monthly allowance.

48
00:02:08.066 --> 00:02:10.800
Can you take it out?
