00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:04.966
I've been too scared to tell you what happened 15 years ago

2
00:00:04.966 --> 00:00:07.200
I'm afraid you'll be sad

3
00:00:07.666 --> 00:00:10.400
Mom thinks the man just now is very likely

4
00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:11.800
It's your blood.

5
00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.100
Father even if not

6
00:00:14.466 --> 00:00:17.066
He must have known your biological father too

7
00:00:17.666 --> 00:00:21.166
I don't know why your biological parents are so cruel

8
00:00:21.166 --> 00:00:22.766
Must abandon you

9
00:00:22.766 --> 00:00:25.500
But since the man just now found it

10
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:26.966
This shows that

11
00:00:26.966 --> 00:00:30.566
Your biological parents have found out your whereabouts

12
00:00:30.866 --> 00:00:34.200
Listen to mom and go find them

13
00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.066
Every family has a difficult scripture to read

14
00:00:37.466 --> 00:00:38.566
maybe

15
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.600
What are their compelling reasons?

16
00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.633
Well, I will go to the hospital tomorrow to check the monitoring.

17
00:00:46.266 --> 00:00:48.100
I want to ask in person

18
00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.833
What did I do wrong?

19
00:00:52.066 --> 00:00:53.966
Why did you abandon me?

20
00:00:54.366 --> 00:00:56.200
Why don't you want me?
