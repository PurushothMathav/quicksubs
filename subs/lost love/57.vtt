00:00:01.166 --> 00:00:03.300
Uh I found it

2
00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:05.466
Is that the man?

3
00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:07.266
That's him!

4
00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:09.000
You're right.

5
00:00:09.066 --> 00:00:11.833
They had a reason for abandoning me in the first place

6
00:00:11.966 --> 00:00:13.366
So I don't blame him.

7
00:00:13.666 --> 00:00:15.066
That's good, that's good.

8
00:00:15.066 --> 00:00:16.466
Just find it.

9
00:00:16.733 --> 00:00:19.000
Just talk about it

10
00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:23.366
And they paid me a lot of money to make it up to me.

11
00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:26.066
So you don't have to worry about the surgery fee, Mom.

12
00:00:26.066 --> 00:00:28.466
The hospital will arrange the surgery for you within three days.

13
00:00:28.466 --> 00:00:30.500
It's true. It's true.

14
00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:31.966
When did I lie to you?

15
00:00:31.966 --> 00:00:34.233
You can take good care of it in the hospital.

16
00:00:35.766 --> 00:00:38.300
Please keep these things for him for me.

17
00:00:38.333 --> 00:00:42.033
I still have something to do first. I'm busy. Okay, let's go.

18
00:00:42.266 --> 00:00:44.333
You can find your biological parents

19
00:00:44.333 --> 00:00:47.766
Mom, even if you die, you will be at ease. What did you say, Mom?

20
00:00:47.766 --> 00:00:50.266
Go then I'll go first

21
00:00:52.866 --> 00:00:54.100
Go ahead, please!

22
00:01:00.466 --> 00:01:01.266
Ah!

23
00:01:01.666 --> 00:01:02.866
Sorry.

24
00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.666
I can't be with you anymore

25
00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.066
Quiet where are you

26
00:01:20.266 --> 00:01:22.400
I want to respect you right now
