1
00:00:00.533 --> 00:00:02.266
Why are you here?

2
00:00:02.366 --> 00:00:04.166
I said

3
00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:05.300
Throughout Jiangcheng

4
00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:07.600
Only my sister, Su Jinhui, can be called one by one.

5
00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:10.100
From now on, it will be called Xiaohong.

6
00:00:10.166 --> 00:00:11.266
Xiaohong

7
00:00:11.933 --> 00:00:13.533
Is that a good name?

8
00:00:13.533 --> 00:00:16.066
It's like a goblin in the shampoo.

9
00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:18.100
It fits his identity and temperament very well.

10
00:00:18.133 --> 00:00:19.666
Look at his figure

11
00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.166
Give 50 a night

12
00:00:22.166 --> 00:00:23.366
I'm out 60

13
00:00:23.366 --> 00:00:28.100
I'll give 80, I'll give 100, no more, hahaha.

14
00:00:28.966 --> 00:00:31.000
Brother, he is my classmate.

15
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:34.800
You and I also said that you are the dignified Miss Su family

16
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.966
He's a wild girl

17
00:00:35.966 --> 00:00:37.766
I'm not even qualified to carry your shoes

18
00:00:37.766 --> 00:00:39.266
He doesn't deserve to be your classmate.

19
00:00:39.266 --> 00:00:42.166
He was the one who made me accidentally hit you this morning.

20
00:00:42.166 --> 00:00:44.766
I'm going to make him pay tonight

21
00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:45.633
But

22
00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.100
Lord, just stay here

23
00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.800
Today is your writing industry is your home court

24
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.233
In this place, you are the queen

25
00:00:54.466 --> 00:00:56.066
See how I treat him

26
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.066
Come on, drink this glass of wine

27
00:01:00.133 --> 00:01:03.266
I don't drink. I don't drink. I don't drink.

28
00:01:09.166 --> 00:01:10.500
What are you doing?

29
00:01:10.566 --> 00:01:11.966
A day 50,000

30
00:01:11.966 --> 00:01:13.866
The money of my Su family is not so easy to earn

31
00:01:13.866 --> 00:01:15.300
1,000 bucks for a glass of wine

32
00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.533
If you can afford it, you can stay

33
00:01:17.533 --> 00:01:19.033
If you can't afford it, get out

34
00:01:19.133 --> 00:01:21.466
Go back and collect your mother's body

35
00:01:22.266 --> 00:01:24.566
You are quite filial if you don't go

36
00:01:25.466 --> 00:01:26.700
Since he wants to play

37
00:01:26.733 --> 00:01:28.500
Don't be idle, brothers

38
00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.400
Let's go together
