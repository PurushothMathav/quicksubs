00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:01.766
I am not human

2
00:00:02.066 --> 00:00:03.233
I'm a beast

3
00:00:04.366 --> 00:00:07.300
My sister saved my wife and I bullied him

4
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.200
Insult him and he will die

5
00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:12.333
Damn it's not my sister

6
00:00:12.333 --> 00:00:14.166
Damn it's me

7
00:00:14.166 --> 00:00:17.200
I'm damned early seven days

8
00:00:17.266 --> 00:00:18.533
Why in the first place?

9
00:00:18.533 --> 00:00:19.333
Mrs. Su

10
00:00:19.866 --> 00:00:21.366
I remember before the surgery

11
00:00:21.733 --> 00:00:23.633
Li Hongyi asked a question

12
00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.033
If he were your biological daughter

13
00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.900
Would you still insist on a kidney transplant?

14
00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:29.200
I think

15
00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.666
He should have known his identity by then

16
00:00:32.066 --> 00:00:33.366
I didn't tell you.

17
00:00:33.366 --> 00:00:35.766
I chose to fulfill you

18
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:38.666
Bear everything alone

19
00:00:42.366 --> 00:00:44.300
I know he knows for sure

20
00:00:44.866 --> 00:00:46.800
What does Xiao Hui want to do when she grows up?

21
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.133
I want to be a police officer.

22
00:00:48.133 --> 00:00:50.700
I will arrest anyone who dares to bully my sister

23
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.266
What if my brother is not in good health?

24
00:00:54.266 --> 00:00:56.900
I want to be a doctor to cure my brother's illness

25
00:00:57.133 --> 00:00:58.500
Awesome come

26
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.500
He just came to see me.

27
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.366
Said to have fulfilled the promise at that time

28
00:01:04.466 --> 00:01:06.400
Let me live well for him

29
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.200
I was so stupid that I couldn't hear anything

30
00:01:09.366 --> 00:01:12.500
When I was young, he said that my health was not good

31
00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.366
He wants to be a doctor when he grows up

32
00:01:16.333 --> 00:01:18.066
Cure my disease

33
00:01:19.133 --> 00:01:20.366
He's a good boy.

34
00:01:20.366 --> 00:01:21.166
Not a pity

35
00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:23.900
Fortunately, I just had a kidney transplant surgery

36
00:01:24.066 --> 00:01:25.133
If you arrange for him to do it ASAP

37
00:01:25.133 --> 00:01:26.066
Blood Center

38
00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.100
It should be able to temporarily protect his constipation

39
00:01:28.533 --> 00:01:30.966
Then hurry up and find him a new kidney
