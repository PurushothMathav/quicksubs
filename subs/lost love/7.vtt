00:00:00.066 --> 00:00:01.900
Take it out

2
00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:03.400
Is that none of your business?

3
00:00:03.766 --> 00:00:05.300
Why does it have nothing to do with me?

4
00:00:05.333 --> 00:00:07.100
This young master has money

5
00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:11.466
Now I want to give you a chance

6
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:12.733
Opportunity for what?

7
00:00:12.733 --> 00:00:15.233
A chance for your mother?

8
00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:23.233
Nice. Kind of cute

9
00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:25.600
So be it.

10
00:00:26.466 --> 00:00:28.966
You play with me for three days, I dream

11
00:00:30.966 --> 00:00:32.466
Ah I warn you

12
00:00:32.533 --> 00:00:34.400
Stop touching my son

13
00:00:34.566 --> 00:00:36.266
Spend your time

14
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.933
If only because he was kind-hearted

15
00:00:37.933 --> 00:00:39.366
I have the same knowledge as you.

16
00:00:39.666 --> 00:00:42.700
I can't spare you if I move one more finger of my son

17
00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.100
A day 50,000

18
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.033
It will take two or three days for you to lose money.

19
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.366
As long as the book is also served comfortably

20
00:00:52.566 --> 00:00:55.033
I'll pay for your mother's surgery

21
00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:56.600
otherwise

22
00:00:57.133 --> 00:00:58.700
Is your mother waiting to die?

23
00:01:03.533 --> 00:01:07.233
Make Xiaohui happy and save your mother's life

24
00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.366
We have the best of both worlds

25
00:01:09.366 --> 00:01:10.666
Accumulate two virtues

26
00:01:11.166 --> 00:01:12.466
As a daughter

27
00:01:12.533 --> 00:01:15.500
Shouldn't you do it for that pitiful dignity?

28
00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.666
Selfish enough to not save your mother?

29
00:01:33.866 --> 00:01:35.566
There you go.

30
00:01:36.566 --> 00:01:37.633
It can't be delayed.

31
00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:39.566
Let's play.

32
00:01:40.266 --> 00:01:42.700
Let's express your hatred first

33
00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.900
This young master said that the shoes are a little dirty

34
00:01:47.133 --> 00:01:50.466
You kneel down first and wipe your shoes clean for this young master

35
00:01:51.066 --> 00:01:52.033
Come on.

36
00:02:12.966 --> 00:02:14.666
Do you have donkey hair in your ears?

37
00:02:14.666 --> 00:02:16.266
I'm talking about kneeling.

38
00:02:16.266 --> 00:02:17.500
All squat down

39
00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.000
Give you a chance.

40
00:02:41.266 --> 00:02:42.500
How about your nobility?

41
00:02:43.066 --> 00:02:44.900
Where's your backbone?

42
00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.066
This is to raise your allegiance

43
00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.900
Put your backbone under your feet

44
00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.666
Let you know the consequences of offending this business

45
00:02:55.766 --> 00:02:56.566
Ah!

46
00:02:57.166 --> 00:02:58.500
Ha ha.

47
00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:00.766
I am now

48
00:03:00.766 --> 00:03:02.833
I feel a little sorry for your mother

49
00:03:03.266 --> 00:03:05.566
I really don't know what evil I did in my previous life

50
00:03:06.066 --> 00:03:08.700
To give birth to such an unsatisfactory daughter as you

51
00:03:09.266 --> 00:03:11.966
Mr. Su, I found the whereabouts of your biological daughter
