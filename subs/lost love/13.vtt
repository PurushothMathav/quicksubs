00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:03.700
Zhou always suspected that there was a sentence pretending to be Miss Friendship

2
00:00:04.066 --> 00:00:05.133
Doubt is not

3
00:00:05.133 --> 00:00:06.500
Just in case

4
00:00:06.933 --> 00:00:08.666
Disappeared for 15 years

5
00:00:08.666 --> 00:00:10.266
Now suddenly appear

6
00:00:10.266 --> 00:00:13.333
I have to be 100% sure of his identity

7
00:00:13.333 --> 00:00:14.500
To be at ease

8
00:00:14.566 --> 00:00:15.266
Ok Mr. Zhou

9
00:00:15.266 --> 00:00:16.233
I'll do it right away

10
00:00:24.166 --> 00:00:28.666
Hahaha got rich, got rich haha

11
00:00:28.666 --> 00:00:31.066
What 5 million, Mom?

12
00:00:31.133 --> 00:00:33.366
Our best days are ahead

13
00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.266
Be well, be well, my baby girl.

14
00:00:36.266 --> 00:00:40.233
Transformed into the eldest lady of the Su family

15
00:00:40.366 --> 00:00:42.966
But Jiang Cheng, I, Wang Shuying

16
00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:47.366
Are you going to walk sideways, hahaha?

17
00:00:50.133 --> 00:00:51.566
What's wrong with cousin?

18
00:00:51.966 --> 00:00:53.800
Mr. Zhou has not fully remembered your identity

19
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.900
He just took some of your hair when you weren't paying attention

20
00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:57.400
Let me take a paternity test

21
00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:59.966
What? I'm going to the hospital.

22
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.133
You also come to the hospital immediately

23
00:01:01.133 --> 00:01:03.100
Find a way to get Li Huyi's hair

24
00:01:03.566 --> 00:01:04.333
Only Mr. Zhou

25
00:01:04.333 --> 00:01:06.166
See the results of the paternity test with your own eyes

26
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.566
We can rest easy

27
00:01:07.666 --> 00:01:08.766
Ok wait a minute

28
00:01:08.766 --> 00:01:09.866
In a minute.

29
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.900
What are you doing in there?

30
00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:13.200
I have an emergency to attend in advance

31
00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.600
Ah you are so sick

32
00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.366
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

33
00:01:19.566 --> 00:01:22.100
Don't be afraid, mom is fine

34
00:01:22.266 --> 00:01:24.000
Will not die for a while

35
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.333
Don't listen to those doctors scare people

36
00:01:26.333 --> 00:01:28.033
We'll be discharged tomorrow.

37
00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:29.866
Don't waste that money

38
00:01:29.866 --> 00:01:30.700
No way.

39
00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.066
I'll figure it out about the money

40
00:01:33.066 --> 00:01:34.700
You must listen to me this time

41
00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.433
I will be responsible for taking good care of my body in the hospital tomorrow.

42
00:01:37.666 --> 00:01:38.966
You child

43
00:01:38.966 --> 00:01:42.000
Grandpa, you have grown up now.

44
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.566
Have you ever thought about trying to find your biological parents?

45
00:01:45.866 --> 00:01:48.833
Maybe they are looking for you all over the world
