00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.866
Dr. Zhao, thank you

2
00:00:06.866 --> 00:00:08.800
Thank you for saving Xiao Hui's life

3
00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.566
You are the benefactor of our Su family

4
00:00:13.866 --> 00:00:16.266
If you need anything in the future, just come to us.

5
00:00:20.266 --> 00:00:21.666
Mrs. Su is too kind

6
00:00:21.666 --> 00:00:25.500
Saving lives is our duty as doctors.

7
00:00:25.533 --> 00:00:29.066
Can I ask who provided the kidney source?

8
00:00:29.133 --> 00:00:30.866
I must thank him in person

9
00:00:33.533 --> 00:00:37.066
Ah, the donor has accepted Mr. Su's 5 million

10
00:00:37.066 --> 00:00:39.733
He doesn't want to divulge his personal information

11
00:00:39.733 --> 00:00:40.733
As a hospital

12
00:00:40.733 --> 00:00:42.900
We need to protect the privacy of our donors.

13
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:44.233
Is that so?

14
00:00:45.466 --> 00:00:47.233
Husband invited you

15
00:00:47.333 --> 00:00:48.533
It's all family

16
00:00:48.533 --> 00:00:49.800
What are you talking about?

17
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.533
Xiaohui is our son

18
00:00:51.533 --> 00:00:52.600
As long as you can save him

19
00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.100
I would give anything

20
00:00:54.533 --> 00:00:56.300
What about that one?

21
00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:57.566
Is there any news?

22
00:00:57.566 --> 00:00:59.966
Why are you still talking about that little calamity?

23
00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:01.866
You didn't notice that his front foot was missing.

24
00:01:01.866 --> 00:01:04.200
The aunt on the back foot has found a suitable one. It's a long way off

25
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:05.300
In my opinion.

26
00:01:05.366 --> 00:01:07.000
The master is right

27
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.533
He disappeared. He disappeared.

28
00:01:08.533 --> 00:01:09.866
Let's pretend we don't have this daughter

29
00:01:10.366 --> 00:01:12.100
But Wenmei

30
00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:16.766
I ask you, Xiao Hui and Yiyi can only choose one.

31
00:01:16.866 --> 00:01:17.866
What do you choose?

32
00:01:20.133 --> 00:01:22.966
What about parents and sisters?

33
00:01:24.666 --> 00:01:25.466
one by one

34
00:01:26.166 --> 00:01:26.966
Mrs. Su

35
00:01:27.333 --> 00:01:30.000
There have been many human traffickers operating near the hospital recently.

36
00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:32.933
There are many little girls missing like Miss Su

37
00:01:32.933 --> 00:01:34.100
The police are investigating

38
00:01:34.366 --> 00:01:35.433
Please come to the scene.

39
00:01:36.066 --> 00:01:36.900
Thanks.

40
00:01:37.733 --> 00:01:39.433
- He went out to play

41
00:01:39.966 --> 00:01:41.266
Mom called him back

42
00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:49.900
Ahhh

43
00:01:58.133 --> 00:01:58.933
Ah!

44
00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:01.400
Ah!

45
00:02:09.566 --> 00:02:12.500
Miss, don't blame me.

46
00:02:12.766 --> 00:02:15.100
Blame it on your dad

47
00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:16.500
ruthless

48
00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.233
Must kill you

49
00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.233
If there is an afterlife

50
00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:22.833
Take good care of people

51
00:02:23.066 --> 00:02:25.066
Live a safe life

52
00:02:25.866 --> 00:02:27.600
Hey who are you

53
00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.166
What are you doing there?

54
00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:36.300
Oh, dear.

55
00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.366
Girl wake up wake up

56
00:02:43.133 --> 00:02:44.266
You can sign in.

57
00:02:44.266 --> 00:02:46.466
Even a little baby was born

58
00:02:47.966 --> 00:02:49.366
Poor girl!

59
00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.866
He wants you. He wants you.

60
00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:03.900
Whelan, you're over it

61
00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.866
Yiyi, this child has been obedient since he was a child

62
00:03:05.866 --> 00:03:07.166
Study well

63
00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:08.800
I'm in college now.

64
00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.666
You don't have to worry about making money in the city and even tuition fees

65
00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:12.500
yiyi

66
00:03:17.533 --> 00:03:20.566
You have suffered a lot with me over the years

67
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.266
I don't know how long I can last

68
00:03:24.566 --> 00:03:25.733
If I die

69
00:03:25.733 --> 00:03:27.200
Yiyi is left alone

70
00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:28.533
What would he do?

71
00:03:28.533 --> 00:03:31.566
You never thought to go to Yiyi's biological parents

72
00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:33.066
Whelan Whelan

73
00:03:33.266 --> 00:03:34.366
Don't be busy

74
00:03:34.366 --> 00:03:35.500
Something happened one by one

75
00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:36.366
What's the matter?

76
00:03:36.366 --> 00:03:38.333
One by one students called the village committee just now

77
00:03:38.333 --> 00:03:39.566
Said that one by one was bullied in the city

78
00:03:39.566 --> 00:03:40.766
Go and have a look.

79
00:03:41.366 --> 00:03:43.000
Hurry up
